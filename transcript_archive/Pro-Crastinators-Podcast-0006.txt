00:00:00 Hello, and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:04 Happy to have you with us once again, I'm GuyTheBestGuyEver, your anime dude, and I'm
00:00:10 here with a bunch of internet people that I know.
00:00:13 First up, Digibro.
00:00:14 Hey, what's up buddy?
00:00:16 Jesse Wood.
00:00:17 Hello.
00:00:18 Hippocrit.
00:00:19 That's what I was gonna do.
00:00:21 That's gonna just say hello.
00:00:24 Well you goofed it up, and Geoff from Mother's Basement.
00:00:28 Money, money, money, money, money, motherfucker.
00:00:31 Booty rocking everywhere, yeah, all right, excellent, okay everybody, so this week's
00:00:35 topic is something that has been an incredibly contentious issue amongst us, and probably
00:00:43 the rest of the world, since the dawn of time, to be honest.
00:00:47 I got my switchblade ready.
00:00:48 It really has.
00:00:49 Since the dawn of theater, we'll say.
00:00:52 That fair.
00:00:53 And to cut straight to it, it is remakes, re-fucking-makes.
00:00:58 Do you like them?
00:00:59 Are they useful?
00:01:00 Do they help?
00:01:01 Do they expose people to a thing that they wouldn't have seen otherwise?
00:01:04 Do they pollute the original identity of that work?
00:01:08 That's the stuff we're gonna talk about, and to start us off, I'm just gonna read the
00:01:12 Urban Dictionary definition of a remake, as I do so often.
00:01:17 Okay, there's, what is this?
00:01:19 This is shit.
00:01:20 You didn't read it first.
00:01:21 It just has lists of what it remakes.
00:01:22 I did not read it first.
00:01:23 He's just like, oh this'll be fine.
00:01:26 I did read the Remakeful one, which is something else that'll be relevant here.
00:01:32 You know what?
00:01:33 We need to define remakes anyways in extensive terms without using this, because we talked
00:01:39 about this a little bit pre-game the other day, and I was saying we need to really clearly
00:01:46 get to the heart of what we mean, because you seem to think that re-imaginings don't
00:01:50 count as remakes.
00:01:53 Like there's remakes, there's re-imaginings, and there's also adaptations of things, like
00:01:58 different adaptations of the same source material.
00:02:01 There's so many different, yeah, and there's these remakes things, like Crisis Core that
00:02:06 like adds extra shit, and kind of, you know, whatever.
00:02:09 But yeah, there's a bunch of different things.
00:02:11 So we really, like this discussion is about what each of those things are, if they're
00:02:14 good or bad, and then I'm sure there'll be disagreement in there, so let's, you know.
00:02:19 But they're not, this is important, is remasters, which is something else.
00:02:23 Sure, right, like the wonderful Final Fantasy IX remaster that's coming out soon.
00:02:27 Have you seen those fucking backgrounds?
00:02:29 Who has seen them?
00:02:30 Holy shit, is there a worse piece of garbage I've ever seen in my entire life?
00:02:34 Is it a worse piece of garbage than the Final Fantasy VI remaster?
00:02:38 I can't imagine, yes, it literally is, because it's the old looking, actually the models
00:02:42 look good in the Final Fantasy IX, but the backgrounds are these disgusting, J-pegged
00:02:47 pieces of shit that not only look bad, but they make the characters on top look like
00:02:51 fucking 3D models walking on top of a board, in a board game.
00:02:55 It is the most, oh, it's horrible.
00:02:58 It looks like a 144p image that's just been blown up to 1080p, which I'm sure is what
00:03:04 they did.
00:03:05 Why would they not like do what the Resident Evil remake, or the Resident Evil HD thing
00:03:10 did, and upscale the fucking 3D models?
00:03:15 I guess they lost them out.
00:03:16 They have, even on the original PlayStation 1, I guess the backgrounds were downscaled
00:03:20 a bit to fit onto it, and I found out that they have the original high res versions before
00:03:26 they were ever downscaled.
00:03:27 Yeah, because they're posting them around.
00:03:28 We've seen them.
00:03:29 But they're not using them.
00:03:30 It doesn't make any sense.
00:03:31 They took the laziest part.
00:03:32 Okay, but you know what?
00:03:33 We didn't even really need to go into that too much, because that's like a remaster,
00:03:36 or just a re-release, which I'm generally okay with.
00:03:39 HD re-releases.
00:03:41 We are not counting as remakes.
00:03:43 We are not counting re-adaptations of the same source material.
00:03:49 So if you say, for instance, Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid, we're not counting
00:03:57 that it's been made into a thousand different movies, because they're all adaptations of
00:04:02 the book, but they're not remakes of each other.
00:04:06 Anything that's public domain can necessarily be called a remake.
00:04:09 Well, okay.
00:04:10 That's sort of my go-to rule.
00:04:11 And this falls under that, so that's fine.
00:04:13 So we're not counting King Kong by Peter Jackson?
00:04:17 No, definitely not.
00:04:18 Well, I think we could, because I think it's a remake within this.
00:04:21 I think a remake should be anything that's within the same medium telling the same story,
00:04:26 right?
00:04:27 Like, King Kong was originally a film, and it was remade to be an updated version of
00:04:34 that film.
00:04:35 It's the same exact story.
00:04:37 You know, I mean, they added some shit to it and modernized it, but it is deliberately
00:04:40 a remake of that film, but for an audience of 90 years later.
00:04:44 It is entirely a case-by-case issue, and you kind of have to study each one to know whether
00:04:50 or not it counts.
00:04:51 I've never seen the new, I haven't seen any King Kong movie ever, actually, so I'll defer
00:04:55 to you where that one's concerned.
00:04:57 But I think it'll be pretty obvious, and we all have examples of things that we think
00:05:00 are okay or aren't okay, and then are remakes or they're not.
00:05:04 Well, I want to say, like, okay, because with Little Mermaid or something, you know, there's
00:05:09 been a bunch of different adaptations, but I think it's pretty clear they all are there.
00:05:13 Like, Ponyo is an adaptation of The Little Mermaid.
00:05:16 It is not an adaptation, it's not a remake of the Disney movie, it's an adaptation of
00:05:21 the book.
00:05:22 But if you took, like, Dracula, where the original book was made into a film, and then
00:05:26 there's like a remake of that exact film, I think that would count as a remake.
00:05:31 Or the new Wolfman movie, which is just the horror, the Hammer Horror movie.
00:05:35 They made a lot of Hammer Horror movies.
00:05:38 It's when you take something that's like a classic movie, and you say something, this
00:05:42 is like the heart of the issue, and you say, you know what, modern day audiences cannot
00:05:47 appreciate this.
00:05:48 We need to update it so that people will be able to watch it, because that's what's
00:05:52 necessary.
00:05:53 I think the defining characteristic of a remake is that it is something that is specifically
00:06:01 using the original as a basis for advertising or marketing itself.
00:06:05 Yeah, yeah, I think so, a lot of the times.
00:06:08 Watch the new Friday the 13th, because everyone loves the old Friday the 13th.
00:06:14 And you know what kind of is related to it, is like continuing a series that's been dead
00:06:18 for a long time, and deciding to resurrect it, and just like pick up from where, the
00:06:22 reboots are related, but not exactly the same, so pro reboot.
00:06:29 Re reboot is the greatest CG TV show of all time, but I do think you're making some uncharitable
00:06:36 assumptions about why remakes are sometimes made, because you're saying like they're made
00:06:41 because they think that people can't appreciate the original, which is certainly true in a
00:06:47 lot of cases, like the shot by shot remake of Psycho, which basically is just done.
00:06:54 Psycho and Schuller.
00:06:55 Like I watch Psycho, that movie is fucking great.
00:06:57 There's no need.
00:06:59 There is no need to do it for that reason, but for the reason of like reinterpreting
00:07:04 it through a new lens, or giving it to a new director to try their own interpretation of
00:07:10 that style, or that storyline.
00:07:13 I want to ask though, what exactly are they reinterpreting?
00:07:16 Is it the movie, or is it like the script?
00:07:19 Because I think that's an important distinction.
00:07:22 Sometimes it's the script, and sometimes it's like the movie itself, or the plot beats.
00:07:28 Is it even possible for someone else to redo a movie that was like the product of multiple
00:07:35 people's creativity working together?
00:07:37 Can you ever really call something like that a remake?
00:07:40 Is that even...
00:07:42 I think that in certain cases you definitely can.
00:07:47 My go-to example from like recent times, because I think we can agree that most horror
00:07:53 movie remakes are terrible.
00:07:55 I'm not a horror movie expert, but that seems to be the consensus.
00:07:58 Yeah, so like the new remake of Poltergeist, shit, the new remakes, like the new Friday
00:08:04 the 13 remake, shit, the new Halloween remake, shit.
00:08:08 Most horror movie remakes are shit, but the Evil Dead remake is fucking great.
00:08:14 I was gonna say how great that movie is.
00:08:17 And like the thing is that it takes the same plot beats as the original Evil Dead movie,
00:08:23 and remixes them with some interesting new ideas as to who these characters are and sort
00:08:30 of what they're doing.
00:08:31 It adds a few modern things, like the reason that they're not leaving the cabin initially
00:08:36 isn't because they're idiots, it's because the only character who actually knows what's
00:08:41 going on happens to be detoxing from a meth addiction, and nobody believes her when she
00:08:46 says demons are coming out of the walls because, I mean of course you think demons are coming
00:08:51 out of the walls, you're coming not off of meth.
00:08:54 But the thing about the Evil Dead remake, I think a huge part of why it was good, is
00:09:00 because Sam Raimi was like heavily involved with it, as a producer for sure.
00:09:05 I want to bring up that subject, okay, like the, I think that the best way for a remake
00:09:11 to happen, because like with remakes I think a lot of the times it is like you know a cash
00:09:16 grab on something that was popular, but I think that if the original had something to
00:09:23 be improved upon, like even, like it's consensus that at the time it was already needed, like
00:09:30 I think with something like Final Fantasy 7, which I know is, okay because this is the
00:09:33 big one, that's the big one, that's what we're ultimately getting to, but I'm not going to
00:09:36 talk about it too much at this point, because I know we're going to get to Final Fantasy
00:09:40 7, but let's build it up at that point.
00:09:43 But the thing about Final Fantasy 7 is when it came out, it was not perceived as flawed,
00:09:48 right?
00:09:49 It only became that after trends in games became something different, where now people
00:09:54 took a while to parse it, I think.
00:09:58 I don't think people play turn-based RPGs anymore, and that's why they think they need
00:10:03 to remake it, right, because they think it's old, it's an old-fashioned style, but when
00:10:07 it came out-
00:10:08 Which if you ask me is an entirely forced upon opinion, is that real?
00:10:11 Stop, let me finish, guys.
00:10:14 Let me finish my fucking point.
00:10:15 My point is simply that at the time that Final Fantasy 7 came out, those were not flaws.
00:10:21 The turn-based battle system was not a flaw, people didn't perceive it that way, but when
00:10:25 something like Evil Dead came out, it had obvious flaws for the medium even at the time,
00:10:32 where it was a low-budget movie with cheesy effects, with a story that didn't necessarily
00:10:38 make sense.
00:10:39 That was the charm of the movie, and some people like it for those reasons, but I think
00:10:43 that the idea of remaking Evil Dead is like, well, yeah, it wasn't perfect, so why not
00:10:49 try to make another version?
00:10:50 And so they did that specifically with Evil Dead, the Evil Dead 2 or whatever is basically
00:10:54 a remake, but I'd call that a reimagining, and here's the thing with all this stuff.
00:11:02 My big issue at the end of the day, if there was infinite time, infinite money, infinite
00:11:07 resources, I'd say make all the remakes you want to an extent, I've got some issues with
00:11:13 it, but if that's how it is, then fine.
00:11:15 My real issue is if it's worth taking the time to specifically invest your resources
00:11:21 in remaking something when you could just be making something new.
00:11:25 But let's not even get too much into that, because with the Evil Dead example, the first
00:11:30 one and the second one are similar, it's the same story, but it's a reimagining at
00:11:35 its core.
00:11:36 It's a totally different movie, and I think that does justify it.
00:11:40 I don't think that that's something that isn't worth making, because there was definitely
00:11:44 something creative going on there, and that's really why it's a case-by-case thing, whether
00:11:48 or not it's okay.
00:11:49 Yeah, yeah, because the original Evil Dead and moreover Evil Dead 2, the original Evil
00:11:56 Dead definitely not a flawless movie, but at the same time, it's one of the few movies
00:12:01 that has 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is kind of crazy.
00:12:08 Everybody loved the movie, even though it was iffy in a lot of spots.
00:12:14 And you're talking about Evil Dead 1?
00:12:15 Evil Dead 2 has like a 97%, it was more contentious, because Evil Dead 2 goes for a lot of balls
00:12:24 of your stuff.
00:12:25 Evil Dead 2 is one of my favorite movies of all time.
00:12:28 I'd say that's vastly superior to Evil Dead 1 personally.
00:12:31 It's much funnier.
00:12:33 Evil Dead 1 is more enjoyable in that campy way, and the Evil Dead remake is a more straight
00:12:39 horror movie that is not going for the campiness, and then if you want more of that campiness,
00:12:47 you can actually get it from Ash vs Evil Dead, the new TV show that they made, which I will
00:12:53 not stop championing, because that TV show, it's got Bruce Campbell in it, it's directed
00:12:58 and produced by Sam Raimi, so it's actually like a legit sequel to the Evil Dead 2, and
00:13:06 it's fucking amazing, but I'm getting off the topic here.
00:13:12 I think to bring it back a little bit, the whole reimagining thing, and to answer Nate's
00:13:20 question about why it's worth it to remake something, I get, yeah, we want to have more
00:13:25 original ideas, but I think there's also some value in trying to make the best possible
00:13:31 version, and the problem is that it's really debatable if you can, because Avangelion is
00:13:40 a great example, where it came out in the 90s, and it was this huge cultural touchstone,
00:13:46 which pretty much created the idea of original TV anime, had this unbelievably deep and
00:13:52 involving story with this great directing, but no matter how you look at it, the production
00:13:58 falls apart in the second half, and the impetus to remake it, now that it made a lot of money,
00:14:04 to me seems obvious, like yeah, the show is already a huge success, and it's already
00:14:09 something that everyone...
00:14:11 Look at the consequences of that urge, Ana's like, what is going on over there?
00:14:16 It's a nightmare, it's taken like what, 10 years to make these movies, and they're
00:14:20 not even close to done?
00:14:21 What the hell?
00:14:22 What a waste, what a fucking waste.
00:14:23 They still haven't gotten to the part that actually needed fixing, which was the last
00:14:28 half.
00:14:29 The funny thing about it is that it's so different now, that it's more of a sequel anyways.
00:14:35 Yeah, there's another huge issue in there, which is like everything is different in
00:14:40 a shitty way, like every change they make I think is vastly worse than the original,
00:14:45 and like, if they just hadn't done it, I'd be happy as a clam, I would've been fucking
00:14:50 over the moon.
00:14:51 It's definitely a weird case, because again, the impetus is obvious, just do the same thing,
00:14:58 make it look better, but then obviously they didn't want to do the same thing because they
00:15:03 wanted to make something different, but the same, it's odd to try to parse, and you could
00:15:09 say that it's worth it to have both versions, and maybe the new one has different meanings
00:15:13 that you could also get out of it, but then it just becomes a question of like, why did
00:15:18 it have to be Ava, you know, why, right, exactly.
00:15:22 I think the iffy thing with that is that it's the same director trying to make the same,
00:15:28 like the same thing twice, and improve upon his own previous work, and I think that that's
00:15:35 a less valuable type of remake than a new director approaching something that they love
00:15:45 and trying to turn that into-
00:15:46 I'll say, I actually honestly, and I couldn't prove this without doing more research into
00:15:51 it, I don't think Anno is as much the director of those movies as people think, Anno's always
00:15:56 listed as like-
00:15:57 It doesn't seem that way.
00:15:58 He's always listed as chief director and stuff, but like, Kazuyo Tsurumaki, his understudy,
00:16:02 he's always listed as director, he hasn't done anything else in the time they've been
00:16:06 working on Rebuild, and his style, he's the one who directed, you know, FLCL and Gunbuster,
00:16:12 I mean, Diebuster rather, and like, the new Ava movies feel more like him, and they're
00:16:17 also-
00:16:18 Right, they feel totally Diebuster-y.
00:16:19 Yeah, and the guy who directed Gankutsuo is also Mahiro Maeda, it's like a big part
00:16:24 of directing the newer ones, like especially part three, so like, I think there's a lot,
00:16:30 I think there's like an understated amount of Kazuyo Tsurumaki and Mahiro Maeda like,
00:16:35 really pulling the unique voice of these movies out, and that's why it doesn't quite feel-
00:16:40 Cause like, Anno's directing, if you watch anything he's made, it's all very slow, very
00:16:45 like, methodical, you know, like there's big moments, but they're always like scary,
00:16:50 and there's none of the like, big, bombastic, crazy thing that happens in the second movie,
00:16:56 you know, when like, the Ava transforms into this other thing, and like, Shinji's a badass,
00:17:01 and it's like, this feels very uh, like, Tsurumaki-y, those things were cool, those things were
00:17:06 definitely super badass, but at the Ava, is it, is it the point, is this what we're supposed
00:17:11 to learn from Ava, Shinji becomes a total fucking ass-kicking monster man?
00:17:14 Well, you say it's not Ava, but now it is Ava, so that's-
00:17:17 I know it is Ava, but it's not like, it's not Anno's Ava, and that's-
00:17:21 And that's exactly the problem with Final Fantasy VII, because when it comes out and
00:17:24 sucks, people are gonna say, well, this is Final Fantasy VII.
00:17:28 Yeah, okay, we need to, we need to, on that issue, we need to bring up how, because we're
00:17:31 talking about this already, uh, the people making the remake, okay, the guy who directed
00:17:35 it was Kitase, he is now producer, Nomura was character designer, he is now director,
00:17:41 and people already throw around the argument, this legitimizes it, this makes it, you know,
00:17:45 like, it's reasonable, the answer is, no it doesn't, because it's been 20 fucking years
00:17:51 since the game came out, Nomura, I mean, and first of all, Nomura was a fucking character
00:17:56 designer, and now he's a director, that's not the same shit, Kitase is a fucking producer,
00:18:00 yeah, go on.
00:18:01 I just want to talk some shit about Nomura, please, uh, Nomura, I blame him for everything
00:18:08 that has fucking happened to Final Fantasy, all the fucking belts, all the fucking leather,
00:18:14 well, all those zippers, I mean, the Final Fantasy VII character designs are all great,
00:18:19 I mean, even Vincent, who's a goofball, is still lovable in his own way.
00:18:23 No, I agree that the character, I'm not actually like, mad about that, I'm mad about the fact
00:18:28 that Nomura does not really know how to design video games, he knows how to-
00:18:34 That's entirely true, look at the fucking compilation, which is his baby, look, he directed
00:18:39 Advent Children, completely got everything wrong, he directed everything in the compilation,
00:18:44 Crisis Core, what people say, it's a fucking piece of garbage, everything new that it introduced
00:18:49 was shit and just had the need to over, the ending with Zack was really impressive, but
00:18:55 completely ruined everything about his death scene from the original that made it so special.
00:19:02 So here, you know, and we don't even need to talk about Durga Cerberus, it's a fucking
00:19:07 stookie, it's poop.
00:19:08 I mean, none of that ruins Final Fantasy VII as much as Final Fantasy XII ruins Final
00:19:16 Fantasy VII.
00:19:17 Because of Shinra.
00:19:18 Because Shinra makes it canon that Final Fantasy X is a prequel to Final Fantasy VII.
00:19:23 Okay, I'll kill every motherfucker on this planet.
00:19:27 Dude, the actual explanation for that is Shinra, right, found the Shinra company, or stays
00:19:32 alive somehow, and then they literally travel from that planet to a different planet.
00:19:36 This is the canon explanation, found that entire civilization, and then eventually Final
00:19:41 Fantasy VII happens.
00:19:42 How the fuck does that make sense?
00:19:43 It doesn't.
00:19:44 It's ridiculous.
00:19:45 So you can ignore it.
00:19:46 Just ignore it.
00:19:47 According to that canon definition, that would mean that the Shinra corporation existed
00:19:50 with the Cetra like a thousand years ago.
00:19:53 That's right.
00:19:54 That's right.
00:19:55 Yep.
00:19:56 I hate them.
00:19:57 I hate them all so much.
00:19:58 Well, actually, okay, it's possible because humans and Cetra were the same thing, right?
00:20:02 Until the media, until Jenova hit or something, right, and then the, whatever, okay.
00:20:06 I think the Cetra have like sin particles in them or some shit now or something like
00:20:12 that.
00:20:13 Yeah, who fucking knows.
00:20:14 Also, why would the Elbed who worship technology become the Cetra who worship the Earth?
00:20:20 No.
00:20:21 I don't even know.
00:20:22 A lot can happen in a billion years, which I assume is the timeline between the two.
00:20:28 So you know.
00:20:29 You know what?
00:20:30 This is just not one single thing about it makes any coherent sense at all.
00:20:32 Okay, the point is, the point is all this shit happened on Nomura and Square Enix's
00:20:37 watch, and these are the people remaking Final Fantasy VII.
00:20:41 That's the issue here.
00:20:42 And what does that tell us about what the remake is going to be?
00:20:45 I think it's quite clear that it is no longer the original vision of the people who made
00:20:49 that game.
00:20:50 And for that reason alone, it, it, I think it's going to pollute the legacy of the original
00:20:56 with whatever, even if there's one tiny change to the story, like, it doesn't even matter.
00:21:02 Whatever it is will be, the series will be worse off because it exists.
00:21:06 I am not interested in how many people are brought into the series by playing this game
00:21:12 and then even decide to go play Final Fantasy VII because I think that they will have a tainted
00:21:16 view of the game.
00:21:18 I would rather have more people with a, with a pure view than a vast number of people with
00:21:23 a corrupted view of what the game was.
00:21:25 I'm not interested in that.
00:21:26 So, I, there's a lot of, yeah, sorry.
00:21:30 You can go ahead because I'm going to change the subject.
00:21:33 Yeah, there's a lot of, there's a lot of shit to unpack in what Nomura has kind of done
00:21:40 to Final Fantasy and like, I think the thing is that Nomura came into Final Fantasy as
00:21:46 a fan of what Sakaguchi has had done and a lot of, a lot of what he makes seems like
00:21:52 Final Fantasy fan fiction, which is why Kingdom Hearts in his hands is so fucking great.
00:21:58 Yeah.
00:21:59 That's fine.
00:22:00 Totally fine.
00:22:01 Because Kingdom Hearts is just Final Fantasy and Disney fan fiction.
00:22:04 It's meant to be.
00:22:05 Well, I say, I say it's fine, but the story has literally gone to absolute garbage in the
00:22:08 last couple of games.
00:22:09 It doesn't matter.
00:22:10 But ignoring that, ignoring that.
00:22:11 It doesn't matter.
00:22:12 The game, the game plays fine.
00:22:13 The first one was great.
00:22:14 Second one was great.
00:22:15 Yeah.
00:22:16 And, and like when Nomura makes his own thing, like, or not necessarily his own thing,
00:22:19 but when they make their own thing and like the world ends with you, that can be really
00:22:23 great too.
00:22:24 Oh, that rule dude.
00:22:25 That game rules.
00:22:26 Like, I do agree with you that Nomura's direction on Final Fantasy has made the series worse.
00:22:33 And the last guy who knew anything about how to make a Final Fantasy game left halfway
00:22:40 through the production of Final Fantasy 12, the director of Tactics.
00:22:43 Right.
00:22:44 The evilese guy.
00:22:45 Yeah.
00:22:46 That man knew how to make a fucking game and now he's gone.
00:22:48 And he's gone.
00:22:49 He's been fucking depressing for me, man.
00:22:51 This is all just.
00:22:52 All right.
00:22:53 Yeah.
00:22:55 Okay, guys, guys.
00:22:56 We're kind of off topic.
00:22:58 I mean, we're on topic because I know we're off topic.
00:23:00 I mean, I think this is more or less proven that remakes cause nothing but sadness and
00:23:05 misery.
00:23:06 Okay.
00:23:07 Let Jeff finish this point.
00:23:08 Then Digi, you can take it.
00:23:09 I'm bringing it back.
00:23:11 What I don't think is I don't think that the point that it's not the creator's original
00:23:16 vision is necessarily a valid reason to say this, this remake will not be good because
00:23:24 if they were trying to do something good with it, if they were trying to do something new
00:23:33 and different that takes the ideas of Final Fantasy 7 and interprets them in new and interesting
00:23:39 ways, that would be fucking awesome.
00:23:41 But what they.
00:23:42 As much as that idea disgusts me, you might that could theoretically be true possibly.
00:23:47 But what it seems like they want to do, and I'm saying this based on, you know, Crisis
00:23:52 Core and all of those things that you mentioned.
00:23:54 What it seems like they want to do is Nomura wants to take his Final Fantasy 7 live journal
00:24:01 fan fiction that he's working on for fucking ever that is just his head cannon.
00:24:08 This is, he's on Tumblr, he's made, he's talking about how, you know, Tifa and Cloud
00:24:13 have to end up together and all of this shit.
00:24:16 And he's, he's making a very much as objective as true as Zach has to be a Super Saiyan or
00:24:24 whatever the fuck was going on.
00:24:25 Not necessarily, Jesse, because humanity may have all died at the end of the, at the
00:24:28 game.
00:24:29 We don't know.
00:24:30 That is true.
00:24:31 That is true.
00:24:32 That is true.
00:24:33 It's ambiguous.
00:24:34 And his fucking compilation ruins that.
00:24:35 It's the most important thing in the entire game.
00:24:36 I hate you, Nomura.
00:24:37 I hate you.
00:24:38 I wish you were dead.
00:24:39 You ruined my favorite series.
00:24:40 Fuck you, Nomura.
00:24:41 Also, Toriyama sucks too.
00:24:42 Lightning's garbage.
00:24:43 But anyway.
00:24:44 Yeah.
00:24:45 I like lightning returns.
00:24:46 Like, I mean.
00:24:47 Maybe that game's okay.
00:24:49 Final Fantasy 13 has at least gotten better since they stopped giving a fuck about the
00:24:53 story and just started making gameplay.
00:24:55 That seems to be true.
00:24:56 You just tested to that.
00:24:57 But yeah.
00:24:58 So, like, the problem, as I see it with this, isn't that they are not making the creator's
00:25:07 original vision.
00:25:08 It's that they're trying to bite Sakaguchi's original vision in trying to make it.
00:25:14 And that, like, I think that if they were trying to make something that was totally
00:25:19 different, that would be fine.
00:25:21 Yeah.
00:25:22 But look at all the advertising remake.
00:25:25 This is it done correctly.
00:25:28 Done as it was always intended.
00:25:29 That really seems to me.
00:25:30 Right.
00:25:31 All right.
00:25:32 Like, let's move on.
00:25:33 I gotta get into this now.
00:25:34 Okay.
00:25:35 I gotta cut a promo here.
00:25:36 All right.
00:25:37 Please.
00:25:38 Look.
00:25:39 We've done a lot of talk about, like, the creators of these games, right?
00:25:43 And a lot of this, you know, you can blame them for making these remakes and trying to
00:25:48 obviously just repackage something that's popular so that more people will buy it.
00:25:52 Right?
00:25:53 I mean, Final Fantasy VII remake, on the sheer idea in most people's minds that this game
00:25:59 is supposed to be the greatest game ever, but they haven't played it because it's old,
00:26:04 and then it comes out and it's new, it will make it sell like crazy, right?
00:26:09 That is true, though I don't like it.
00:26:11 Now, here's the thing.
00:26:12 The problem to me is not necessarily the creators, it's the gamers, and I think in
00:26:19 general the product of all these remakes is that people don't give a fuck about art.
00:26:25 That's true.
00:26:26 People don't care about art.
00:26:29 They care about just being entertained.
00:26:31 They just want to consume shit, right?
00:26:33 You put it in front of them, they watch it.
00:26:35 The reason Psycho gets a remake is everyone knows about Psycho.
00:26:39 Everyone's heard of it.
00:26:40 A lot of people have probably seen it.
00:26:41 Nobody wants to see a black and white movie.
00:26:43 Right.
00:26:44 No one's going to go out of their way to download a black and white movie and watch it, even
00:26:48 if they would probably like it, and there is some level of understandableness to this.
00:26:54 Maybe people don't really have the language to communicate with older art.
00:27:00 If you've never seen a black and white movie, it might be hard for you to sort of process,
00:27:06 and most people don't want to put the effort into watching old shit.
00:27:09 They just say, I don't like it.
00:27:11 This is a very intricate topic that's going to be difficult to parse.
00:27:15 The thing is, because I'm going to bring this back to Final Fantasy VII, I grew up without
00:27:24 a PS1.
00:27:25 My first console was the N64.
00:27:26 I didn't have a Sony until 2003 with the PS2.
00:27:32 I went back and I got really into JRPG, so I went back and tried to play all the old
00:27:37 Final Fantasies.
00:27:38 I played most of the first discs of Final Fantasy VII, which is as much as I've played
00:27:43 of it to this day, but I did love it at the time, like 2005.
00:27:47 I loved the art.
00:27:48 I loved everything about it.
00:27:51 My little brother, Victor, is a very modern spoiled gamer because he's been playing games
00:27:58 for as long as I have, but he's never gone back and played old games.
00:28:01 I go back.
00:28:02 I try to play NES games, Super Nintendo games, all the stuff I missed out on.
00:28:06 He's never done that.
00:28:07 So Final Fantasy VII is getting a remake and immediately he's like, oh yeah, now I get
00:28:13 to play the new one instead of the old one, right?
00:28:16 And so I told him how everyone was, you know, I told you guys, you guys all jumped down
00:28:22 his throat immediately, and then I told him how you guys all jumped down his throat and
00:28:26 he's like, man, whatever, I don't think I can get into an old turn-based game.
00:28:32 And then Nintendo, you know, made cloud in Smash and he got all excited because they
00:28:38 were showing all the aons and shit and playing the old battle music.
00:28:41 Those are summons?
00:28:42 Aons are Final Fantasy X?
00:28:43 Whatever.
00:28:44 He saw all the summons and he was like, oh man, I forgot, Final Fantasy is pretty cool.
00:28:48 I now want to play VII, so I get him, you know, I have it on Steam, so I put it on his computer.
00:28:53 He plays like the first hour and he says, man, this is already the coolest game ever.
00:28:58 And he plays it for one more hour, gets tired and decides not to play it anymore because
00:29:04 he got tired with the battle system.
00:29:06 And like, but I, you know, on the one hand, I can say I get it, right?
00:29:11 Because he doesn't care about video games as art.
00:29:14 He cares about it as something he plays, you know, he doesn't really think deep about video
00:29:18 games.
00:29:19 It's something that a game comes out, he gets hype for a new game that's about to come
00:29:22 out, you know, he's always riding the hype cycle, watching all the previews, the game
00:29:27 comes out, he plays it, and then it's gone.
00:29:29 It's, that's it.
00:29:30 That's, you know, maybe it comes back later when he plays it again, if he plays it again.
00:29:34 But it's not something that like, he's got this grand cultural idea of what games are.
00:29:39 Yeah, let me bring up a point about this real quick.
00:29:41 Because I think an important touchstone for this whole discussion is Red Letter Media's
00:29:48 Jack and Jill video, in which they say specifically how, like, that movie is a corporate, disgusting
00:29:55 piece of garbage that only exists to make money and has no artistic value whatsoever.
00:30:00 But people don't care.
00:30:02 At the, like, the justification, or what they say is like, at the end of the day, who cares
00:30:07 about this movie?
00:30:08 Like, who is harmed by it?
00:30:09 The answer is only people who look at movies as art and are interested in it as an artistic
00:30:13 medium.
00:30:14 Everyone else is fine.
00:30:15 Doesn't matter.
00:30:16 My Asterisk War Part 9 video that's going to come out in a couple days is almost exactly
00:30:20 the same point now that I think about it.
00:30:22 Like, the thing is, with video games, there's this great article, I don't remember what
00:30:29 it's called, I need to track it down again so you can put it in the description.
00:30:32 But it was by this guy who was, like, a teacher of, like, game design or something like that.
00:30:38 And he had this class and he asked everyone in the class, raise your hand if you're a
00:30:42 fan of the Elder Scrolls series.
00:30:45 And like, 75% of the kids raised their hand, right?
00:30:48 And then he says, like, how many of you have played Skyfall and they also have their hands
00:30:52 up?
00:30:53 Then he says, how many of you have played Oblivion and then, like, more than half of
00:30:59 them lower their hands?
00:31:01 And then he says, how many of you have played Morrowind and there's only, like, two guys
00:31:05 left?
00:31:06 And then he says, how many of you have played Daggerfall?
00:31:08 No one.
00:31:09 So these people say, I'm a fan of the Elder Scrolls series, but they've only played the
00:31:15 latest one.
00:31:16 And it's because there's this sort of idea that's very prevalent among gamers because
00:31:20 gaming isn't really recognized as an art form in the greater cultural sense yet.
00:31:26 It's still sort of treated as, like, you know, obviously gamers think it's an art form and
00:31:30 they'll defend it like that.
00:31:32 But then at the same time, they don't treat it like one.
00:31:34 Because if you get into film, if you try to be a film major or something, you will go
00:31:39 back and watch stuff from the 20s and 30s and 40s and you will watch it as a chain.
00:31:45 That's the point that I raised in my Final Fantasy VII rant video back in last summer
00:31:49 where I said, you know, gamers always want to defend games as art, but then they also
00:31:55 turn around and go, well, we need it with better graphics though and we need a new version
00:31:58 of it and we need it.
00:31:59 It's just a prank, bro, argument.
00:32:01 So here's sort of my take on it because I come at this from, I think, a slightly different
00:32:10 perspective from you guys.
00:32:11 You're all a little bit older than me.
00:32:14 Wait, how old are you?
00:32:16 You're young, really?
00:32:17 Get the fuck out of here, pal.
00:32:20 I'm only 23, so...
00:32:22 Well, I don't think any of us is over 25, so...
00:32:25 Yeah, but I mean, like, the thing is, Jesse's 26, I forget.
00:32:30 That difference of, like, two or three years is the difference between having been old
00:32:35 enough to play Final Fantasy VII when it came out and having to go back and play it.
00:32:40 Okay, sure.
00:32:41 And that's kind of...
00:32:43 So I was at a similar position to Digi's Brother, where I hadn't played it.
00:32:51 And the thing was, or the thing is that I went to school for game design.
00:32:56 I obviously am very interested in studying old games as an art form.
00:33:01 And for me, Final Fantasy VII, more than, say, Final Fantasy IX and more than Final Fantasy
00:33:10 VI, kind of came across as a chore to play, because it was in that dip in quality in terms
00:33:18 of, like, visual fidelity and a lot of other stuff where they were figuring not where they
00:33:24 were...
00:33:25 Holy shit, okay.
00:33:26 Man, I'm gonna fucking murder you when you're asleep.
00:33:27 It's good.
00:33:28 It's like somebody really revealed their immaturity.
00:33:29 Well, I think Jeff's point is, I think it's fair that he's actually played the game and
00:33:38 formed an opinion on it.
00:33:41 I'm not saying that everyone needs to recognize Final Fantasy VII as a great masterpiece.
00:33:46 I just think it's dangerous that we have this new game coming out and people won't go play
00:33:51 the original.
00:33:52 Yeah, and that's...
00:33:53 Agreed.
00:33:54 I would rather someone hate Final Fantasy VII than like the remake.
00:33:58 I agree.
00:33:59 Well, I might feel that way about both, but the thing is that VII was harder for me to
00:34:07 play through than VI and was harder for me to play through than IX and was easier for
00:34:11 me to play through than VIII because VIII is fucking garbage, but let's not get into
00:34:15 that whole discussion.
00:34:17 Nice.
00:34:18 Yeah, okay.
00:34:19 Fucking plan.
00:34:20 But so VII has that very awkward, we're trying to figure out how 3D graphics work aspect
00:34:30 to it, and in terms of old games with 3D graphics, it doesn't hold up to the same degree as,
00:34:37 Metal Gear Solid or Mega Man Legends 2 or...
00:34:42 Okay, you better get to your point quick because I'm going to destroy you on this point momentarily.
00:34:45 You're going to murder me.
00:34:46 Yes.
00:34:47 No, no, no, I've got a good retort to this.
00:34:49 Is it the Hippo Crit retort because we could let him finally tell us?
00:34:52 That is exactly what it is.
00:34:53 Magnificent.
00:34:54 Yeah, so...
00:34:55 Yeah.
00:34:56 Let's just finish this point, then I'll...
00:34:58 So, like, what I'm saying is I did actually make a concerted effort to play through and
00:35:05 enjoy Final Fantasy VII, despite that.
00:35:09 But something that I think gets lost is that Final Fantasy VII is, in some ways, harder
00:35:18 to enjoy than the SNES-era Final Fantasies and the late PS1-era Final Fantasies, because
00:35:25 it falls into that middle ground of they were still trying to figure out how to make it
00:35:29 work.
00:35:30 The combat is a little bit on the slow side compared to...
00:35:33 And quick and responsive.
00:35:34 I actually do agree.
00:35:35 It's fun.
00:35:36 It's a bit slow.
00:35:37 Things take a little longer in combat than I'd like.
00:35:39 And I love turn-based combat.
00:35:42 My favorite game right now is Legend of Heroes Trails in Cold Steel.
00:35:47 My favorite...
00:35:48 One of my favorite games of all time is Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky.
00:35:52 I love Skies of Arcadia, so it's not like a problem with what they're going for.
00:35:59 I love Final Fantasy's battle system in particular, because I think Bravely Default's one of the
00:36:06 most brilliant gameplay-wise games of the last decade.
00:36:10 In terms of battle systems, yes.
00:36:12 Yeah, story-wise, it's hit or miss.
00:36:14 I mean, the second half is kind of, but whatever.
00:36:17 In terms of game design, and I think about a lot of stuff in terms of game design, because
00:36:22 that's what I studied, 7 definitely has some stuff to it, but it's got those load times
00:36:28 or huge fucking pain in the ass.
00:36:30 The graphics in battle look a lot better than the graphics on the overworld, but it's still
00:36:36 like...
00:36:37 Alright, let's stop you there.
00:36:38 I want Hippo to make his defense of the overworld graphics that I really love, and Nate does
00:36:43 too.
00:36:44 Yeah.
00:36:45 I've seen Nate's video, but yeah.
00:36:47 I hate you.
00:36:52 Well, I haven't played the other Final Fantasy games, so I don't know how much, how good
00:36:57 I am of a retort I am, but I played Final Fantasy 7 quite recently to form an opinion
00:37:05 on it for the same sort of reason, so that I could compare it to the remake when it comes
00:37:10 out, and I like all the low-poly, the low-resolution stuff.
00:37:18 I forgot what my actual argument was.
00:37:20 Your argument was that the way that they animate the characters is very expressive.
00:37:26 But the way that all the dialogue is portrayed is like the characters move their bodies because
00:37:31 they couldn't animate faces to express this.
00:37:35 Right, so for someone to say that the animations, they did well with what they had.
00:37:43 Right, and so for someone to say that a remake will be better in every way is ignoring the
00:37:48 things that were the product that they were forced to do, which in this case is the incredibly
00:37:52 animated models, which I love, which is one of my favorite things about that game.
00:37:55 It gives us a very silly feel, that's super endearing, and the remake will not, will not
00:38:00 in even close, be able to capture that level of, you know, comfiness.
00:38:05 I don't disagree, and I do appreciate- It's going to be grimdark as fuck, and I already
00:38:11 wish I was dead.
00:38:12 The voice acting alone is just going to kill it by itself.
00:38:17 Voice acting in games is a huge issue.
00:38:19 I wish it was gone.
00:38:20 It needs to go away forever.
00:38:22 We can talk about that specifically.
00:38:23 The Advent Children voice cast is- At the very least, every game that did not have
00:38:29 a voice cast should never ever, ever, ever, ever be given a voice because I've already
00:38:34 got the voice in my head, anything else to be parable.
00:38:37 I want to make that argument in a sec, but I actually do want to chime in on the graphics
00:38:42 thing that you guys were talking about, because I do appreciate that old school style of what
00:38:50 Final Fantasy VII's overworld characters are basically, is they are big blocky 3D sprite
00:38:56 equivalents.
00:38:58 So what they used to do in the old, old Final Fantasy games is they'd have like a few different
00:39:02 dance animations for the sprites that would like express what emotions they were feeling
00:39:09 in very simple and obvious ways.
00:39:12 And I, you know, obviously I like that because I like Final Fantasy VI, and-
00:39:18 Terra's like scared reaction, like, ugh, face, it's like, it was great.
00:39:21 I love that sprite.
00:39:22 And like, what, the problem that I have isn't that they try to do that in Final Fantasy VII
00:39:31 necessarily, because I can appreciate, like I can appreciate that in other games of the
00:39:38 era that have similar limitations and do similar things with their graphics.
00:39:43 What I don't necessarily like is A, the disconnect between how these characters are presented
00:39:50 in battle and out of battle.
00:39:53 I think it like creates a little bit too much of a dissonance in my mind for this is like
00:39:58 the same world that this is taking place in.
00:40:01 And the other thing that I'm not a particularly big fan of is that that was the point where
00:40:08 Final Fantasy started to try to go for that cinematic appeal.
00:40:14 And having that cinematic appeal with these very expressive or that like cinematic style
00:40:22 with these camera angles and all of these supposed supposed to be cool action sequences
00:40:27 with these-
00:40:28 Oh, supposed to be, he said.
00:40:29 Okay, go on.
00:40:30 With these adorable little stop motion muppets is jarring as fuck.
00:40:36 If I can nitpick your points, I gotta say that whenever I hear people bring up things
00:40:42 like disconnect or dissonance, those just sound like words to me that critics invented
00:40:47 that don't actually mean anything.
00:40:49 Like, where is this disconnect that I'm supposed to be feeling that everyone else always points
00:40:54 out in things?
00:40:55 I think Jesse and Jeff-
00:40:56 Is it because the backgrounds are so pretty and the models?
00:40:58 I think it's totally fine for Jeff to have all those opinions about the game, but I'm
00:41:03 just nitpicking.
00:41:04 Well, I think it's something that like, you know, you can go back and play the game and
00:41:08 feel that.
00:41:09 And maybe you would have felt that when you played it the first time in 1997.
00:41:13 Like, maybe you would have played six and then played seven and felt that disconnect
00:41:17 and that could be totally normal.
00:41:19 But I think-
00:41:20 Like, the thing is, I think seven would have blown me away if I played it when it came
00:41:25 out.
00:41:26 Well, none of that.
00:41:27 I mean, that might be true, but none of that is the issue.
00:41:29 The issue is, does this justify a modern day remake as we've seen it going to do?
00:41:34 I don't think so.
00:41:35 I want to actually bring up Final Fantasy VI, because really, Final Fantasy VII, the original
00:41:43 is to me an example of how to do a remake well, because it's kind of a remake of six.
00:41:49 Not in like the story, but they carry so much over from six.
00:41:52 It's got the same modern setting, Sephiroth is basically a less funny, more serious Kefka.
00:41:59 The final boss battle is exactly the same.
00:42:01 Essentially, they looked at six and said, well, we have a more powerful console now,
00:42:05 let's do this again.
00:42:07 But what makes it not a remake is obviously they made a whole new world and a whole new
00:42:11 story and a whole new characters to base it around.
00:42:13 So if you want to remake something or put a new spit on it, just take the elements that
00:42:19 you liked and make something new with it.
00:42:22 Making a remake entirely like to the point is entirely-
00:42:25 I want to raise-
00:42:26 So is it just not obvious to everyone why they're doing it?
00:42:30 There's only one reason.
00:42:31 They're trying to make money.
00:42:32 I want to raise a point about old games in general and advice to people who haven't played
00:42:39 a lot of old games, because I do think, while I think Jeff's points are valid about feeling
00:42:44 that disconnect and that that's a personal thing that some people might feel, to bring
00:42:49 back to the defense, because as valid as your feelings are, also valid is our defense that
00:42:57 we like I think all four of us on the other side of the discussion like those character
00:43:02 designs and the way they're used in the story.
00:43:04 And I think that people need to go in with an analytical slant towards the way that graphics
00:43:10 are used as opposed to what the graphics are.
00:43:13 Because I think that saying that new graphics are necessarily better than old ones is kind
00:43:20 of like saying that movies are inherently better than books because they can show you
00:43:24 things on screen as opposed to describing them.
00:43:27 Right.
00:43:28 When in reality a book, a great book can have a description in it that's way better than
00:43:35 a shitty movie's image.
00:43:37 And I think with old games there can be Super Nintendo games like say Chrono Trigger that
00:43:43 are so evocative of a time and feel and place that they still resonate with you more so
00:43:50 than a modern game that has really high-res graphics.
00:43:55 If you look at those Shakespeare re-envisionings, you know the ones that do it in messages
00:44:00 with ascii, fucking smileys and shit, that's an extreme example, but that's what it reminds
00:44:07 me of.
00:44:08 It's like trying to reinterpret the thing that already exists in a new way to make it
00:44:12 more immersive.
00:44:13 What you're ignoring in that situation is the incredibly important what that art piece
00:44:18 made at that time says about that period of time, which is a super important aspect
00:44:23 of it.
00:44:24 And I think that when you take the turn-based battles out of Final Fantasy 7, you really
00:44:29 make it a different game and you're not acknowledging it by calling it a remake.
00:44:33 And that's where, again, remakes, that's the issue.
00:44:36 That's a reimagining at that point, I agree.
00:44:38 My stance on remakes in general, which we should have probably gotten to this 40 minutes
00:44:44 ago.
00:44:45 My overall stance on remakes is like, as pieces of art that exist in a void, like if I didn't
00:44:51 take context into it, I don't think there'd be much to complain about because it's just
00:44:55 a different game and you have both.
00:44:57 But in the context of reality where I know people are going to play the new Final Fantasy
00:45:02 7 and take it as the Final Fantasy 7, it's worrisome, but at the same time, no one who
00:45:09 actually takes the game seriously as art is going to do that.
00:45:13 The people who give a fuck are us.
00:45:15 We are the ones who are going to write history books about what video games are, you know.
00:45:19 There's going to be people out there that just fall through the cracks and only get
00:45:22 the newest one no matter what.
00:45:24 I worry for that.
00:45:25 The crux of my position on remakes is, you know, I've seen and played enough good remakes
00:45:32 that I can't just throw the baby out the bathwater and say that remakes are all inherently bad
00:45:37 and they shouldn't exist.
00:45:39 But what it comes down to is just whether or not I trust the people in charge of the
00:45:43 game, specifically in the case of Final Fantasy 7, if you look at Square Enix's track record
00:45:48 for the last, oh, I don't know, 15 fucking years, you cannot trust these people to make
00:45:54 something of the same quality.
00:45:55 Wait, let's ask a question.
00:45:57 Let's look at other Square Enix remakes.
00:45:59 Jeff, you probably played this.
00:46:00 How was the remake of Final Fantasy 3 on the DS?
00:46:03 The remake of Final Fantasy 3 is actually something I was going to bring up as the original, did
00:46:09 you?
00:46:10 Nobody did, because it was Japan exclusive.
00:46:13 Can we really form a comparison?
00:46:16 The thing is, in terms of viewing it as its own property, it's definitely solid.
00:46:22 And I have played old school Final Fantasy, so I know how that looks.
00:46:28 And I have, I mean, the gameplay systems are exactly the same.
00:46:30 Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the Game Boy Advance, much better than the original NES version.
00:46:36 Tweaked and improved in a lot of ways to avoid all that fucking grinding, yeah.
00:46:42 Or here's a slightly more contentious example, a Chrono Trigger on the DS, less of a remade.
00:46:50 It doesn't have very little cool cutscenes, I mean, that was from the PlayStation 1 version.
00:46:55 They put in the cutscenes for the PS1 version, but it has none of those load times that kind
00:46:59 of ruin the PS1 version.
00:47:01 And it also has a bunch of new endings, some of which are pretty interesting and help to
00:47:05 connect it to Chrono Cross, which some people might think is.
00:47:09 I do like those, but I have to ask myself, was this intended, is this the real story
00:47:14 of these characters that, I know they tie in Shala and Chrono Cross more, which is really
00:47:19 cool because I know in Chrono Cross, Shala exists, but we probably don't have the correct
00:47:25 answer to this, but was this intended, is this the real story of Chrono Trigger?
00:47:30 I think you care a lot more about authorial intent than I do personally.
00:47:35 I think that the writer on the guy who wrote the scenario for Chrono Trigger was the guy
00:47:42 who did most of the direction on Chrono Cross.
00:47:44 The reason why authorial intent is important is because I want to play the game that was
00:47:49 intended originally, and I know there's lots of issues that come up whenever you're making
00:47:53 a game.
00:47:54 Things get cut, things get changed, the corporate stuff has an influence on the artists.
00:47:58 But you know, I'm interested in playing this game that I can say, okay, this was made by
00:48:03 these people at this time, it has, I'm going to interpret it in these ways, and you know,
00:48:08 things are getting a lot more complicated, and maybe it's just me, you know, screaming
00:48:11 against the wind.
00:48:12 I mean, I never helped.
00:48:13 I think it's pretty easy to look at the Final Fantasy VII remake and say, this is clearly
00:48:17 not what Final Fantasy VII was intended to be, this is clearly not what anyone involved
00:48:22 with making the game would have made it, and they've just taken someone else's idea and
00:48:27 because they own the intellectual property, they are allowed to do whatever they want
00:48:31 with it.
00:48:32 And I think that there's so many signs that it's obviously going to be a problem game,
00:48:39 because it's obvious to me that with the whole thing where they have to split it into, you
00:48:45 know, an episodic release, and what that says to me is the game is way over budget,
00:48:49 and the reason the game is way over budget is because it has to appeal to everyone.
00:48:53 So they're not trying to make an art piece, they're trying to make a game that everyone
00:48:57 will buy.
00:48:58 Like Final Fantasy VII at no point had a part where you, after, you know, after you finish
00:49:03 the first disc, you have to wait months for the rest of the game to be released, and then
00:49:07 you have to do that again.
00:49:08 It's not art, it's not.
00:49:10 I do want to defend one thing on the budget perspective, which I think is one good sign
00:49:17 in relation to this game, which is that they're remaking a game that has pre-rendered backgrounds,
00:49:24 and I would say that the one thing about Final Fantasy VII that does absolutely still hold
00:49:28 up is the pre-rendered backgrounds.
00:49:31 And that's something that, you know, I wish we had more of, and my complaints about Final
00:49:38 Fantasy VII's graphics are not necessarily complaints about, I don't think that graphics
00:49:44 from that era can hold up, I just don't think that those ones particularly do.
00:49:51 But the Final Fantasy VII remake is trying to remake a game with pre-rendered backgrounds,
00:50:00 which means that it wasn't, it's a game that never really reused any assets because it
00:50:06 didn't have to worry about storage space in the same way as other games, and it didn't
00:50:12 have to, so like every environment could feel completely fucking different and new and awesome
00:50:18 and not have to share the same fucking crates and barrels from every other area of the
00:50:23 game because they didn't have to reuse those assets over and over again.
00:50:27 And with Final Fantasy VII, the remake, if they're...
00:50:33 You know they're going to reuse shit everywhere.
00:50:35 Well they might reuse shit, but like the thing is that if they're trying to make Midgar feel
00:50:41 like the Midgar that people remember, they are going to have to create a lot of unique
00:50:46 environmental art assets for every single area of that game, which is going to require
00:50:53 a lot more dev time than you would typically get.
00:50:56 And you know what else is something that people like to bring up in regards to this game, is
00:51:00 they say, guys wouldn't it have been great if when we played VII you could explore more
00:51:04 of Midgar, like more sections, okay see the thing with that is guys, the people who could
00:51:09 have theoretically written cool things to happen in those places are all gone.
00:51:14 The thing that's going to fill in these spaces you want now is Nomura, Advent Children, uh
00:51:19 fucking Durgessurbership, that's what's going to be in those spaces.
00:51:23 It's going to be flying fucking motorcycle battles with them.
00:51:24 I just watched that episode of Futurama where Frye delves into his memories and like anything
00:51:30 that he didn't experience on his last day in 1999 was an empty white space.
00:51:35 That's exactly what this is, and it's going to be filled in by fucking Nomura and his
00:51:39 incompetent Kingdom Hearts writing.
00:51:42 So here, yeah, here's like the sort of problem with how they flavored the new version of Midgar
00:51:49 is the old version of Midgar had like a sort of fantasy and sci-fi crossover feel to it,
00:51:58 and the new version of Midgar feels a lot like a cyberpunk version of Tokyo, which is
00:52:04 Look, there was a there was a moment in the Final Fantasy 7 trailer that I saw in Nature
00:52:10 video that officially was the moment when I said this isn't going to be good, and it's
00:52:16 there's a part where you see Cloud running through a tunnel and there's some debris blocking
00:52:21 his path, and then he does that whole side scooch thing where like the character crawls
00:52:28 in between two pieces of debris and slowly moves forward every new game you know it was
00:52:34 it was really it was an uncharted a lot it's in the new Tomb Raiders it's in like all those
00:52:39 it's in the last of us all those games directly from Final Fantasy 15 so get excited for that
00:52:45 guys that's going to be a great game right well right and 15 might be good but do you
00:52:49 want load screens that's that's that's the load screen replacement I would take load
00:52:53 screens if the game was more fun I just think that those moments in in they're in like every
00:52:59 modern game yeah they feel like shit you you're you're controlling normally and then suddenly
00:53:06 you're controlling like not normally right and they'll always have a few of them back to back
00:53:10 just to sort of break up you know whatever you're doing and like I get it it's it's to change the
00:53:15 flow a little bit you know but I had to load screen that's the that's what it is they put
00:53:20 you in a tight area so that they can load everything I'd rather have like an okami load
00:53:24 screen which has a little minigame on it that you can play well you can't do that Namco you
00:53:28 can't do that Namco just lost that patent like this year hey there you go sweet so but like so
00:53:35 now we'll have load screen minigames again thank god I just handed that shit holy shit fuck them
00:53:40 yeah then go suck a dick I think you know well for one thing you probably wouldn't need those types
00:53:46 of load screens if you didn't make your games so overblown look look at Dark Souls right Dark Souls
00:53:51 is no load screens well fucking Dark Souls has the elevators but um well those are fine you know
00:53:56 they work they blend into the world seamlessly they're fine by me they don't make your control
00:54:00 scheme the point yeah the point is they crafted the world to avoid any kind of super no problem with
00:54:04 load screens that are integrated into the gameplay in a way that feels natural like an elevator or
00:54:10 or um I like I I think that how the uncharted games handle it in creating that feel of I'm watching
00:54:17 a movie is better for those games than right for those games sure I saw it those games but yeah
00:54:24 what what you know Final Fantasy 7 being this this RPG Final Fantasy 7 being this this RPG and I mean
00:54:31 it had cinematic moments where you know your controls change you do different stuff but it was
00:54:35 always for like in a mini game you can still control cloud though but right well there's always
00:54:40 like a mini game like you know you're riding your bike and you're slashing people or you're doing all
00:54:44 this other stuff it's always like a creative fun way to change to change the tension of the scene
00:54:48 well let's not let's not you know ignore the like 30 minute long cut scenes that happen sometimes I
00:54:53 mean there's only like one of those I'm not talking about that I'm talking what bothers me like one
00:54:57 of the biggest things that bothers me in games is where my controls change for no reason for sure
00:55:03 like when it when a character slows down to start talking on a calm or something and I have to now
00:55:08 walk weird and slow and it just feels like like like the like I might as well just have dropped
00:55:13 the controller you know like yeah yeah like at least for the cut scene you you have this
00:55:17 understanding that that something that it's pulled away to show you something you know like like it
00:55:23 doesn't bother me too much when the cut scene is like a straight up movie it does bother me when
00:55:29 you're playing like let's say a first person game like Metro and like there's a cut scene
00:55:34 in first person so you sit there and you keep hitting forward on the controller because you're
00:55:38 just waiting to get control of the character and you don't know when the cut scene stops or starts
00:55:43 so you're just sitting there hitting forward over and over again like why why am I not moving you
00:55:48 know but like in in a game like Final Fantasy 7 seeing something like that appear I'm just like
00:55:55 this like why would that happen in this game why would it take control away from me just like
00:56:00 like Mass Effect 3 and the answer is obviously because that's what games do these days you know
00:56:04 it really doesn't matter what we think because if the comment section of Nate's video proves anything
00:56:10 I was just gonna want crap I wanted to end this with a reading of several of my favorite comments
00:56:15 from that but yeah go on people crave mediocrity nowadays you know I'm of the opinion that that
00:56:21 AAA games development has terribly deteriorated and devolved in general or like games today at
00:56:29 least they're all the big budget AAA games are legitimately are legitimately worse in general
00:56:35 than older games and it's 1998 was like a golden time dude right around that I'm inclined to disagree
00:56:41 but that's that's because I have played almost every new game for like the last three years
00:56:52 would you say that more of the new would you say that more of the good new games were AAA games
00:56:56 or would you say that more of them were like more undertale you know I saw one guy well all the
00:57:02 good games that are coming out now the majority of the games that are really you know impressing
00:57:07 people are getting played a lot or successful or good are all you know modestly made indie games
00:57:13 with one or two guys in charge of it should be made by smaller teams I think and not be so bloated
00:57:21 I think yeah a with you know more restrictions it's like the art from adversity thing where like
00:57:26 if Final Fantasy 7 had come out with all the technology it has now back then it would have had
00:57:32 you know advent children cutscenes and it would have been impossible to take seriously I had a
00:57:36 point yeah I just I'm I hate everything I think I don't want it to be fair the way I'm with you
00:57:41 Jesse I think I don't think it's as strict a dichotomy as you're painting with the AAA versus
00:57:46 indie because I think I I strongly believe that we need to start using the terms AA and single a
00:57:53 like I would say AA games would be like Dark Souls what is AAA even you know come to think about
00:57:58 so actually we had discussions like this a lot in the in the chat room for the website I used to
00:58:06 work for because you know these divisions were kind of our bread and butter and the
00:58:17 yes the division between like Dark Souls is kind of in like a weird thing because Dark Souls 1
00:58:24 is probably I would say edging between AA and AAA but then Dark Souls 2 has more of a AAA
00:58:32 aspect to it and Bloodborne is 100% a AAA game to me the definition of AAA
00:58:39 should mean like the studio that made it right yeah like to me the the definition of AAA is not
00:58:44 necessarily what's in it or what like how good it is or how good it looks or whatever it's how
00:58:50 expensive was it no it's what it is um as I know well advertised it it's marketing budget marketing
00:58:57 is what defines something being AAA versus being like a single a and like this is how they think
00:59:04 about it at publishers when they say a AAA game that's their tentpole that's like their that's the
00:59:10 equivalent of a blockbuster movie right and and I I don't think that AAA games even are completely
00:59:17 bankrupt because two years ago we got Grand Theft Auto 5 which is a remarkable game on many many
00:59:27 levels and completely bankrupt I just think that there's an inherent loss of modesty that comes
00:59:32 with the new technology and these huge overblown budgets like you know but the last of us the last
00:59:38 of us felt like a very modest game a lot of the time except during the parts where you had to
00:59:44 load everything about the last of us it belongs I want to say I think what happened to games is
00:59:49 sort of similar to what's going on with the economy at large right that we've got a growing
00:59:54 upper class and a shrinking middle class that's very good I think with I think with video games
00:59:59 because the thing is when you look back at like a list of the top 100 super nintendo games or the
01:00:04 top 100 playstation 1 or games like it's it's always like all of them are pretty on par in terms
01:00:12 of like what they are we're like yeah look at the top 100 ps1 games and it'll be like you've got
01:00:19 Final Fantasy and stuff are like probably the more expensive ones but then you you can't really
01:00:24 tell there's not like a huge difference between like Final Fantasy and Ape Escape in terms of like
01:00:29 what kind of game they are how they kind of look you know or are going down the line you know there's
01:00:34 cheaper games there's the the the japanese rpgs that are like all 2d even though they're on the
01:00:39 ps1 you got like the legendary like no one can stop mr domino they all feel like they're on the same
01:00:44 sort of like plane of existence where like if you played like you know like a cheaper game versus
01:00:50 a more expensive game they all they all kind of feel the same whereas like now when you look at a
01:00:55 triple a game it's like this unlike impossible to comprehend production where you you look at it and
01:01:01 you go where how is this possible because for me personally uh like the overblown hd graphics
01:01:07 actually physically hurt my eyes so whenever i look at it i feel like i'm staring at like god and
01:01:11 it's just beaming into my eye i don't want to say like it's happening i don't like the idea of companies
01:01:17 striving for greater fidelity and i know there's going to be you know uncanny valley stuff along
01:01:21 the way i'm fine with that i just it's when your efforts like i think in final fantasy 15 this will
01:01:26 probably be the case when your efforts to make a game pretty adversely affect how fun it is to play
01:01:32 or your your resources are diverted to that that's when you got a fucking problem as a game and i
01:01:37 think we need i think what i'd like to see is for the middle class of games to come back
01:01:43 you know where i think i think they've been living strong in japan you know i think there's
01:01:47 so plenty of i want to see more like devil may cry and platinum games like platinum games where
01:01:53 it's like they have they have modern graphics but they're not like this is like battlefield
01:01:59 three ridiculous bullshit where it's like it has to be lifelike in order to step to be pushed you
01:02:05 know like just make games that look that look modern but are like fun arcade games that are
01:02:12 that are cool you know like i think i think if we had a lot more platinum games tier developers
01:02:18 then it wouldn't always either be oh this game's an indie darling that has all these amazing ideas
01:02:23 but it looks like fucking shit or oh it's this game that's got like that makes my computer explode
01:02:29 but it's fucking boring you know like i need more of that middle class that i feel like we really
01:02:34 had on the super nintendo and ps1 where like every game was on that same sort of tier you know aside
01:02:42 from like the tentpole games i see there i definitely don't think that every company should be going
01:02:49 for max fidelity i don't really think that any company should because it takes away from the
01:02:55 other stuff that you can be doing with the new technology in terms of building like where's the
01:03:00 emphasis on like the artistry as opposed to the where's like the designated like hundred man team
01:03:05 to be like we got to make this the best artistic piece prop like we possibly can no instead they're
01:03:10 all fucking working on like textures for like leaves on a tree it's like what what the fuck guys
01:03:15 that's not i so specifically when it comes to environmental details like that a lot of
01:03:21 procedurally generated these days like trees no triple a studio makes its own trees anymore
01:03:27 there is a dedicated there are like three dedicated tree populating algorithms that
01:03:35 are okay for for sale and for license to a bunch of play it's it's the same as like physics engines
01:03:41 like everybody uses havoc everybody uses unreal because those things take away from the amount
01:03:49 of time that you have to spend doing that nitty gritty shit yeah and like artists want to place
01:03:55 their own mark on stuff and they do in game companies like i know people who work in game
01:04:02 companies i've worked on games previously um and there is definitely like at every studio at every
01:04:10 level there are people doing something that they they feel proud of and that they want to put their
01:04:15 mark on um or you know obviously there are some people who just want to cash a paycheck but you
01:04:26 there is so much competition for jobs in the triple a industry that to just be capable of
01:04:32 cashing a paycheck you have to be among the best of the best and you have to be capable
01:04:39 you have to have that artistic drive and you have to be capable of there's an entire arc of
01:04:43 shiro bako about this one of the characters goes to uh work for a cg animation company
01:04:51 all it's they they basically do like the car cgs for like every show and video game like yeah
01:04:57 and the the director of the company is just really passionate about cars but if you work there all
01:05:03 you do is design cars forever you know and she's yeah she was like designing like just rims like she
01:05:11 was only allowed to design rims that she's talking to the other members of the company and they're
01:05:14 like yeah after two years i got to move on to tires you know and she's just like oh my god and
01:05:18 then she realizes i want to do artistic stuff i'm gonna go but like everyone who was working at
01:05:24 the company was working there because you will never need work you always will have work because
01:05:29 they always get hired to do cars and so she was like i'm gonna go work for some indie team and
01:05:35 just say fuck it because i need the artistic gratification you know so that exact thing happens
01:05:40 quite frequently around me because uh i live in the same city as the big ea games campus so i know
01:05:49 city is that uh vancouver oh yeah right yeah so i know people who literally all they do is try to
01:05:58 get the details right on every single player in the entire football league or every single player
01:06:06 in and when i say football i mean soccer football like inferior european football yes um yeah or try
01:06:14 to get every single nba players jersey fucking down and the the environmental model uh modelers
01:06:22 all they fucking work on is stadiums and basketball courts and there is a super high turnover at ea of
01:06:31 people going indie like vancouver has a huge indie game scene because people do get tired of that
01:06:38 over time but the thing is um a i i think that there there is some value in having these big
01:06:50 triple a monstrosities because um uh a sometimes they offer really epic uh mind-blowing experiences
01:06:59 like uh i would say grand theft out of five offered that um and b they act as a sort of training
01:07:06 ground and a proving ground for people to uh practice get their 10 000 hours in of becoming
01:07:15 like a true fucking master of what they do and then they can go and they can they can go into the
01:07:21 indie space and make that middle class that you're talking about bro and that middle class is growing
01:07:26 like if you look at steam the biggest games on steam these days are often uh yeah i think like
01:07:33 something like rocket league feels sort of that that i mean it's sort of bare bones but like the
01:07:38 way the graphics are and the the depth of the the engine and everything is like yeah this is more than
01:07:43 just some indie game okay you know what this is all this witness the witness is a good example
01:07:49 well didn't he spend like six years spending like a lot of money making uh making braid and then
01:07:54 or and just reminding uh looking at the steam front page has reminded me this will bring us back
01:08:00 to remakes and is one of the best examples of a sort of middle class level development
01:08:06 and one of the best examples of a remake of all time xcom the new election about xcom uh so the old
01:08:15 xcom uh was really ugly and really fucking hard and uh it's got a lot of i mean it's still a good
01:08:23 game but it's also basically unplayable for a modern gamer and i'm not just saying that because of uh
01:08:29 it's very inaccessible in how it's designed and the new xcom takes all of the ideas of the original
01:08:34 xcom and just makes them palatable to a modern gamer but it so i think it's a it's a remake done right
01:08:43 but then also the interesting thing about it is is that it was like wildly fucking successful
01:08:48 meanwhile xcom the bureau or the bureau xcom declassified the shitty first person shooter that
01:08:55 they made set in the xcom universe was supposed to be the triple a tent pole of uh xcom and it
01:09:01 fucking flopped while uh everybody bought xcom one and now xcom two is the most hiked that's
01:09:08 that's very interesting and i i my my position is and always has been i it's not like every single
01:09:15 remake will always be a mistake but i do think that they are rare and in generally i think the
01:09:20 practice uh isn't as valuable as pursuing new works but here's like here's the my why i think xcom
01:09:29 kind of just i call the exception that proves the rule but maybe you'd say it but the thing is
01:09:35 that xcom is that rare example of they put resources into making a new thing the bureau xcom
01:09:42 declassified and they put less resources into making a remake because the game design was done
01:09:48 and a lot of the world building was done and it was just a matter of like building the game and
01:09:52 yeah and the the remake was vastly fucking superior to the piece of fucking garbage new thing that they
01:10:02 tried to write okay here's my question that's true i mean i always okay going back to my earlier
01:10:07 point that i think a remake should like is is understandable if you're just trying to perfect
01:10:10 the original do you think that the new xcom would have been better if they just hadn't called it xcom
01:10:17 like if they just no no something else i i think it it perfects the original x i'm asking nape like
01:10:23 do you think oh do you think we'd be better off if like if you took an idea you had that you that
01:10:29 you released and it was pretty okay and then you made a much better version of it and said it's a
01:10:36 remake would that be less valuable than if you said well i just reskinned it and now it's about
01:10:42 different characters and it's a different ip well okay the the critical word there is reskin because
01:10:47 like if it really is the same game only you just change like fluff then like what do you that's
01:10:53 that's that's not a substance of what i'm saying is that they change the entire story of the game
01:10:58 they it's it's a remake it's the same thing but they changed the the systems of it to make it better
01:11:05 so it's a remake yeah but it's it's a much better game and i think like if you say that like what's
01:11:12 the point of just remaking something that already existed it's like well they made a good game as
01:11:17 opposed to the not so good one so like well i feel like your argument that they should have made
01:11:22 something new it's like well they did make something new they just it's just that it's so
01:11:27 similar to the old one that you know i changed the my argument is is really about the the use of
01:11:33 resources it sounds like in this case they were because they were already making this other game
01:11:37 they had the assets to use and like it didn't require a massive amount of work to do and it's
01:11:43 like if it's what the artists like if it's better and pretty much objectively then you know there's
01:11:49 really much to complain about but like really your complaints with remakes are one it should be the
01:11:54 same people uh i'm not saying it should or it should it should be something that reflects
01:11:59 the original artistic intent yeah um or otherwise be something totally different because why even
01:12:05 call it the same thing yes and i can agree with that i think like you know i think there's plenty
01:12:10 of great remakes out there and i think that they they could easily have just been called something
01:12:15 else but they needed the brand recognition you know which is frustrating which which which hurts
01:12:20 the art form that yes we take focus away from the original and we put it only on the new one
01:12:26 although at the same time it can often drive attention to the original where there's probably
01:12:31 a lot of people who will play final fantasy seven just to compare it to the remake you know
01:12:37 so i think there's still a lot of potential that it's actually net positive for the original game
01:12:43 okay but your but that's not counting my second argument which is the effort that was put into
01:12:47 making this remake you could have spent yeah so i'll i'll definitely say that like i think in the
01:12:52 end if the result was actually a better game and like it was something they were doing because
01:12:58 they legitimately wanted to improve final fantasy seven and not just resell it to a new audience
01:13:04 then i think it would possibly be justified to possibly use the resources but i i i think like i
01:13:11 think there's a false assumption there in that if they weren't making if they didn't have this remake
01:13:18 project going they would have a different project active at the studio because oftentimes um remakes
01:13:25 square enix we're talking about final fantasy 16 just get working on it you know whatever they
01:13:29 got to do so like in terms of resource distribution a lot of the time remakes like remasters particularly
01:13:38 are like you need like four or five people to work on them that's that's their very small projects
01:13:44 but remakes too can be much smaller projects not necessarily in the case of final fantasy seven
01:13:49 because obviously they're giving it a full triple production yeah yeah but um in a lot of cases a
01:13:56 remake will need to have like a smaller team than a full triple a thing and it's something that they
01:14:01 can work on without necessarily having to have like a full a full staff of um you know a full
01:14:10 staff of writers to i mean obviously this is an example that's helping my point but like like the
01:14:15 final fantasy six remake that just came out like what was even the point of that just re-release
01:14:18 it literally looks worse in every way well that's not a remake that's a port that's a bad port it's
01:14:23 a port with completely replaced artwork which was well no not completely replaced they put a filter
01:14:28 on it which is garbage um like final fantasy six like like what it is is it's just like they took
01:14:36 all of the sprites and then they put them through a program that smooths out all of the edges which
01:14:40 is the worst thing that you can do the sprite artwork so they just look like shit they vector
01:14:44 they vectorize the sprites basically and it's terrible um whereas uh final like the so the
01:14:53 assumption that you're making that uh they would be making or that they could be making
01:14:59 something entirely new instead mm-hmm a i think is somewhat false because oftentimes like they
01:15:07 they are putting less resources toward making the remake happen and they don't have to put as many
01:15:13 resources and uh and be um i think you can go through yeah and be i i think that uh the remaking
01:15:23 something with with a director or a team that has seen the original thing and thinks this was cool
01:15:32 i want to do it my way and better is often super valuable like the example often often like the
01:15:40 example i think it would be more valuable if they changed the name but i think here's some i think
01:15:46 let let let me just i have a few examples beyond xcom going back to movies scarface is a uh remake
01:15:55 of a like a silent film a silent era uh film and uh the thing which is in my opinion the single
01:16:05 greatest horror movie ever made is basically a remake of a very shitty 60s sci-fi movie called
01:16:15 the thing from another world okay you brought up the scarface in a discussion we had before and i
01:16:19 think that's probably an example of something that skirts the line between a remake and a reimagining
01:16:25 because there's there's no way that like that the silent movie has like the same script or or the
01:16:30 same like direct like so much i'm assuming has changed that it really seems like a whole new
01:16:35 thing it's not just like a i don't know what it's based on or anything i don't know if like the the
01:16:40 movie was was the basis of that foundation but like you know that's one of those things that's not
01:16:45 well i don't know and i want to make though nate yeah with your whole uh argument about like the
01:16:50 resources is that like that is i will give you a very idealist viewpoint but i think that it's
01:16:59 possible that they need remakes to make money so that they can make the other dude yeah bet on a
01:17:06 sure thing to make the like because the thing is with square enix specifically like we all know
01:17:11 that they've been bleeding money out of their games they keep saying that every game because they
01:17:15 make such bad choices right i mean yeah they make terrible choices but they release tomb raider the
01:17:20 same week as fallout four that's a brilliant idea or you know even just focusing on the final fantasy
01:17:25 brand like they made three final fantasy thirteens after the first one was not even liked what what
01:17:30 was that about that is not sure that the first one is not liked the first one is well beloved by a
01:17:35 myriad of people who have you just have to look at the sales figures overall okay yes it did i think
01:17:41 it actually might have sold better than any other final fantasy besides like seven i think that's not
01:17:45 because it was good games have done pretty okay and a lot of people have done worse like even after
01:17:49 the second one did much worse like why would you make a third one at that point doesn't make sense
01:17:53 i don't know because they were probably because they had the assets and they could throw it together
01:17:57 that's not a good excuse that's a bad excuse but anyway is that they they are bleeding money
01:18:02 they made a bunch of games that they made over budget even though those games sold unbelievably
01:18:08 well they didn't sell enough to make back the stupid budgets you know yeah we're like tomb raider
01:18:13 sold like fucking five million copies and they still said it was the basis of my criticism is
01:18:18 this is bad art and like okay it's probably a great financial decision but it's making shitty
01:18:24 art but the thing is like if we're talking about this team like let's say i mean if you're if you
01:18:30 were saying resources is like a nebulous thing where their resources could somehow get transplanted
01:18:35 to another studio like well i'm not saying that but ultimate philanthropists and just give all
01:18:40 their you know give all the talent that they have for Final Fantasy VII to a studio that can actually
01:18:45 but like if that's not the case then the question is how are they gonna make up for all this loss
01:18:50 they've had make Final Fantasy XVI just do but they haven't even finished Final Fantasy XV and
01:18:55 they probably already sunk too much money into that game and it's gonna be a financial disaster
01:19:00 well that's their fault dude that's not a thing to make their money back and they think Final Fantasy
01:19:06 VII i'm not saying it's necessarily a good idea but like they clearly think dude i get it Final Fantasy VII
01:19:12 even the original is still a top selling game if you go on to the ps4 and you go to the top sellers
01:19:19 bracket it's Final Fantasy VII is always the top selling game on the ps4 it's it's true you know
01:19:25 that's that's fine i i get it i know why they do it and if i were the if i were their executive i'd
01:19:29 probably do it too but none of this changes the fact that it is going to pollute the legacy of the
01:19:35 original by objectively being a worse thing i know it to be true i'm not arguing that point in the
01:19:40 nothing about any of us say against any remake really matters because we're all just nostalgia
01:19:46 fags that's that's right yep that's all that matters the only one here who's not a nostalgia
01:19:51 fag as yeah you're superior no if you're a legend of zelda ocarina of time on the 3ds fixed uh the
01:19:59 biggest problem to the game unfortunately i still think it's a worse game because it's on the 3ds
01:20:05 and not on my television where i can actually see the entire world here's a difference of opinion
01:20:11 that i have i think that um like i strongly prefer playing games on handhelds to playing them on a big
01:20:20 tv these days well that's weird i like that all the wrong things to me especially especially big
01:20:26 rpgs because with big rpgs i want to take it out of my pocket play a few battles i don't go
01:20:32 anywhere i don't leave my house digi digi digi digi you gotta you gotta listen to him on this one
01:20:36 because he's right playing uh some an rpg on your game boy in bed was how i spent most of my
01:20:41 childhood and it was objectively the best you guys are animals i think that's it all handhelds games
01:20:47 are objectively inherently trash advanced games in there i played it all they should never have
01:20:53 been made they should do the game only sp every game has zero artistic merit if it's not on my
01:20:59 fucking television set or on a screen big enough for me to sit in front of and fucking watch
01:21:04 like a human being not like an animal in a dog house with a fucking game boy advanced a fucking
01:21:09 pokemon made sense on a handheld console because it was like you had you had your your your fucking
01:21:16 n64 that was doing all this crazy shit right but pokemon didn't need all that crazy shit so like
01:21:23 it it was a fucking 2d game that doesn't give me this fire but now you do crazy shit in your pocket
01:21:28 yeah like that's the big crazy shit should be on a big screen where i can fully appreciate it
01:21:37 because of the scale of everything doesn't even that you look up in the distance and you see this
01:21:41 huge mountain you see that mountain and you scale the mountain that's actually the one and only
01:21:46 criteria for whether something is actually good or worthless whether or not it's a handheld or an
01:21:51 actual game which is on a real screen was on game boy and it was the best game ever made and
01:21:56 that's the end of it it's on a console because it didn't have huge scale but
01:22:05 that's right mother three was originally going to be an that is irrelevant to my point you're
01:22:09 saying that you can't make an epic story they adapted it no not the story i'm talking about the
01:22:14 visuals you don't make a 3d game with epic scale graphics like a game like ocarina of time where
01:22:21 part of the appeal is it is that you see big mountain and you go climb big mountain and it
01:22:26 looks huge on your tv as opposed to your little picture why can't a picture be small and still
01:22:32 good here's here's my here's my uh counterpoint to that do you play with 3d on digi no because it
01:22:39 makes my eyes bleed so so here's the thing you play with 3d on that completely no i appreciate
01:22:46 don't get me wrong i know that the 3d in that game looks really good but it makes my eyes bleed
01:22:52 and i can't look at it and my argument here is so we're making the complaint that it's less epic
01:22:57 because you're not doing the thing that makes it like i can't i literally can't it makes my eyes
01:23:03 hurt too much well that sounds like a personal problem but like i'm making the complaint that
01:23:06 it's objectively garbage because you gotta fucking bend your body over like a no you fucking jesse
01:23:11 look at a time you gotta strain your eyes looking at a tiny fucking baby screen
01:23:15 there's no fucking point but why would you not want to be sitting in a chair or a couch or
01:23:20 something comfortable like a human being why do you want to live like an animal why do you want
01:23:25 to be a fucking savage in the one everyone don't play fucking why don't you just go crawl outside
01:23:29 your tp and take a shit in the dirt guys that's shabby as ever you're barely even human a film
01:23:35 a film aficionado make the argument that oh yeah that movie that you saw in theaters and it was
01:23:42 my like like fucking what's a mad max theory road yeah that's gonna look just as good on your
01:23:47 fucking iphone as it does in theaters no talking about that that's the difference between like
01:23:53 it may not look just as good on your iphone as it does in theaters but it will look almost as good
01:23:58 on your tablet as it does on your tv because you're not in a fucking theater a theater experience
01:24:03 is completely different i don't care how good it looks on my tablet i think that even something
01:24:07 on my fucking tablet which it shouldn't be because my tablet is a crappy little handheld device
01:24:12 that fits in my fucking whole pocket and i can't whatever you want why are you why are you gonna
01:24:17 take that away from people who like to watch things on the tablet because nobody deserves to have
01:24:21 anything that sucks i want the world to have things that are good and i want the world to have
01:24:25 good hands and that is why and that's why they should not remake the final fantasy seven remake
01:24:30 it does not deserve to exist you have to know what's good the buttons are too close to my fingers
01:24:37 and they're all too tacky and they suck it's a shitty controller it's like it's like playing
01:24:42 like like like putting your hands on a plank of wood with buttons and then holding it six inches
01:24:47 from your face and you can't be comfortable with it when i could have a beautiful sleek controller
01:24:52 in my hand that is built for hands because it doesn't need to account for screens or how small
01:24:57 it has to be a physical controller so okay so you want to you want to talk about better versus
01:25:04 worse uh so ocarina of time works i would say as well on a console as it does on a handheld i'm
01:25:11 not going to argue that but if you want to talk about the best zelda game which is majora's mask
01:25:16 majora's mask is so much fucking better on a handheld because you can do a bus ride and in that bus
01:25:23 ride have i ever done a bike ride you what the fuck are you talking about what is this about a
01:25:29 bus ride so if he's saying that you can play you can play through a mission by the end of a bus
01:25:34 ride i know the mission a cycle or a side quest it compartmentalizes uh a game that is like it
01:25:42 intended to be replayed a whole fucking bunch i do all of my gaming better on a handheld i do all
01:25:48 of my gaming in 10 hour chunks i don't play 20 minutes of a game and then put it in my pocket
01:25:54 i turn on the tv and i have to sit there all day because if it takes me more than three days to
01:25:59 beat a game i will never beat that game i really where this argument is concerned i'm with matthew
01:26:04 mitosis uh because i had a psp and a d i had every fucking handheld in the world and like matthew
01:26:09 mitosis says in his peace walker a metal gear solid review that um like the game was designed to be
01:26:14 in mission format so that you could play it like on a bus but like right on the bus and you're playing
01:26:18 it and you finish a mission and you've still got five minutes like okay what do i do do i try another
01:26:23 mission or do i turn it off now just wait either way it's not really doesn't really perfectly work
01:26:28 that has happened to me every time i've tried to play every time i ever try to play a game
01:26:34 like a real game on like a ds or something i love like for me the only kind of games i can actually
01:26:39 play the way that mobile games are intended to be played is if it's like don't touch the
01:26:44 white tiles and it's like i'm just touching tiles and then it's over when they the doctor says you're
01:26:49 up and i i hit exit and it's done and the game is over forever you know like i kind of agree that's
01:26:54 the kind of game that i think is a good a good handheld game you know so yeah like for me the
01:27:00 ones that i think are the best are weirdly the big sandboxy rpgs because that those are games
01:27:08 that you can play for whatever period of time you feel like playing and get a good amount except
01:27:14 for 10 hours because if you try to play for 10 hours then the strain on your eyes and hands
01:27:19 will break you and yeah that's the length of time i want to play the game for okay guys guys
01:27:25 so argument is like kind of related to remakes but kind of almost not at all so i think we should
01:27:31 roll it back a little bit you know yeah i just wanted to get heated about that for yeah yeah
01:27:36 we we thought we were going to stab each other over final fantasy seven but we
01:27:40 turns out it was about each other over handheld jrpgs which is let me let me just say that like
01:27:45 i want to be super clear to everybody watching that like when i see an old character like brought
01:27:51 back to life like the first time this happened to me was when i first heard about kingdom hearts one
01:27:56 and i saw cloud was in it that's what made me buy that game i thought that was the coolest thing
01:28:00 that ever happened and because in no way that was celebrating the existence of cloud that was
01:28:06 not something that in any way changed the interpretation of the character and when cloud
01:28:11 got into smash it was the same thing and just today when i saw ramza lugria ramza bewulf the
01:28:17 3d screenshots of him and the new decidia that is a celebration of the character that in no way detracts
01:28:23 from their legacy things like that could not be more excited about them they're fucking fantastic
01:28:28 it's when i have a problem when something comes along and is trying to one up uh someone who like
01:28:36 like sakaguchi is the is the guy and the the writer whose name i forget uh who made final
01:28:40 fantasy seven what it is they're the guys who did it and now we got these new guys i say they're
01:28:45 gonna redo it and you know i i just don't think there's even a ghost of a chance of them really
01:28:51 getting what that game was about and communicating it in a in a meaningful way and for that and i
01:28:56 for that reason i think it will only pollute the legacy and i don't want that to happen
01:29:01 and so that's the real reason at the end of the day i don't like remakes in addition to the other
01:29:05 reasons that we talked about before anime is a japanese colloquial
01:29:12 oh Jesus christ what a bombshell what a bombshell so so you know i just want to ask you know as
01:29:28 our is our special guest of the day um uh jeff mother's basement i just want to ask you your
01:29:34 thoughts on as the only one of us as the only one of us who's met sakaguchi how does it feel to know
01:29:39 that you are advocating the pollution of his artistic vision how does that feel you feel good
01:29:44 about that well okay so for one thing sakaguchi's artistic vision is that final fantasy six is the
01:29:51 best final fantasy but he likes final 97 too it's not like he hates the game he doesn't want it
01:29:56 raped he doesn't want to see it raped he doesn't want to see it raped and you know sakaguchi um
01:30:02 man my my opinion is that you guys should all go play terra battle because uh sakaguchi is making
01:30:09 new cool shit i would love to i should i should um and that's a mobile game by the way better on
01:30:14 handheld mother fuckers um but um yeah i don't play the yeah go ahead go ahead it's it's actually
01:30:22 okay so terra battle pretty cool game it's all about positioning tiles it's kind of like halfway
01:30:27 between a puzzle game like a match three puzzle game and an rpg uh but not like puzzle quest
01:30:32 anyway like yeah it's like puzzle dragon or something i am not strictly speaking advocating
01:30:39 the final fantasy seven remake reaping the shit out of everything that's already been done they're
01:30:44 just going back for another round yeah because i they they did already destroy it with advent
01:30:48 children um and they they which i mean let's be real the only to to to quote uh to quote max
01:30:58 from life is strange the only well not to quote but to paraphrase the only good final fantasy
01:31:04 movie is the spirits within um interesting which because there's not a lot of competition
01:31:09 there but okay because they didn't try to make something that was the same fucking thing wait
01:31:15 wait how old is this girl who said that uh she's like 18 18 oh okay i thought she's like 13 i was
01:31:20 gonna call her hipster that's not so bad no yeah like what she specifically says is she's like i
01:31:25 don't care what anyone says this is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time and that game
01:31:30 was published by square enix so um yeah so you know but anyway i am still sour over this whole
01:31:40 i mean they fired sakaguchi over yeah he resigned he resigned to be fair he resigned but it was like
01:31:46 you know that that whole japanese resiner will right tell you thank you coach him it did recently um
01:31:54 and uh well actually i don't know that i can't speak for sakaguchi because he didn't tell me that
01:31:59 anyway i am not advocating them destroying his vision of this game that in part he made for his
01:32:07 dying mother and which obviously was very died she was already dead dude she was dead oh she was dead
01:32:11 yeah yeah so which was obviously which is the most beautiful vision and i love this game so much and
01:32:16 to learn something like that years after playing it my god people what are you doing what are you
01:32:21 doing so so i am not necessarily advocating that i think that a final fantasy remake could
01:32:28 potentially be good and i think that gameplay wise like the thing is this could fun to play this
01:32:33 could rape or this i don't want to say rape over and over again this could fucking destroy every
01:32:40 bit of artistic integrity that final fantasy seven has just like uh shin megami tensei four destroyed
01:32:49 every bit of artistic integrity that the shin megami tensei series has but it's still it's
01:32:54 still a fucking fun game to play which means people still consider it to be a good shin megami
01:33:00 tensei game and this could still be like a good final fantasy game but here's the here's what i would
01:33:05 advocate um get uh what i would advocate playing final fantasy seven if you feel like you want to
01:33:14 play final fantasy seven take out your psp or your ps vita get it on your psp or your ps vita
01:33:20 and play it that way or on steam why do you want them to have the worst possible experience
01:33:25 because it's much more palatable to play it on a handheld where uh the load screen or your ps4
01:33:31 where you won't have to play it play it play it on a fucking place the sony playstation you know
01:33:36 look fill the great thing is you've got options you're gonna love final fantasy seven you're not
01:33:40 gonna want to play it for 20 minutes at a time before breaking your neck you're gonna want to
01:33:44 wear crt television set and a sony playstation with a fucking memory card and one of the skinny
01:33:50 original controllers and you fucking sit there and you take your fucking medicine until you
01:33:55 beat in the fucking game and then you could have an opinion you talk like an animal he's right
01:34:01 it's objectively the best way to do it also you should do it in 1997 if possible or 1990 and be
01:34:06 like eight times of twelve yeah yeah so the best the best way to do it just smack yourself in the
01:34:12 head until you remember what computer graphics are capable of now and then go back and and play
01:34:18 but yeah like so i i think that that game provides a better experience on handheld like all
01:34:26 rpgs but okay i would advocate playing it that way he really wants he's cruising for a bruising
01:34:31 i gotta let's let's let's move on past this point we're getting uh can we end this i i you know i
01:34:37 think we've wrapped up you know what just just i wanted to do one thing before we ended which was
01:34:40 just to read a couple of just to get an idea of what people in general think about remakes like the
01:34:47 the slobbering masses i wanted to read three of my favorite comments on my final fantasy seven
01:34:52 remake video all right here we go uh oh where where they go hang on okay here's here's the first one
01:34:57 that's kind of reasonable uh why do people focus more on the negative side of the remake than on
01:35:02 the positive side i know square enix completely screwed the company in the seventh gen but come on
01:35:07 they can't make another mistake after 13 and 14 love that one okay i've got two more um what is it
01:35:14 i hope you don't get this game after you just made this video this video is pointless and cancerous
01:35:21 and finally my favorite one of all to cap it off by calypso handjack my hero stopped watching after
01:35:28 30 seconds cloud did not wear purple guys a fucking retard stop making videos thank you calypso
01:35:36 thank you very much i think he summed up all of our thoughts he really did he really did
01:35:41 at the end of the day you got to go with your handjack i'm gonna jack your hand all right that's
01:35:45 it thanks for watching everybody uh appreciate you sticking with us for this long one i hope you
01:35:50 have a very special day everybody say goodbye bye bye play final fantasy seven on your
01:35:58 okay
01:36:00 he's doing i don't like him he's dumb you're dumb you're dumb
