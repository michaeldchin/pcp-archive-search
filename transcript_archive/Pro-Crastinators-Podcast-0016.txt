00:01:07 As I'm a digital cyberte-
00:01:09 An-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an
00:01:14 No.
00:01:18 No.
00:01:25 No.
00:01:27 Hello and welcome to this week's episode of the Procrastinators podcast.
00:01:31 I am your host for the week, the best guy ever, and I'm here with my panel of American
00:01:38 heroes once again.
00:01:40 First is Digi Bro.
00:01:41 Hey, what's up motherfuckers?
00:01:44 We have a true Blue American Gibbentake.
00:01:47 I'm...
00:01:48 I mean Hippocrite.
00:01:49 I'm a large water dwelling mammal.
00:01:52 The DeVoo.
00:01:54 Yo.
00:01:56 And our special guest for the week is our good friend Munchy.
00:01:59 It's about time.
00:02:02 Munchy is a guy who worked with Digi way back in the day doing art for him and is an eccentric
00:02:09 character we met.
00:02:10 He still does all of that.
00:02:11 He does all of that.
00:02:12 He does my avatars.
00:02:13 Yeah.
00:02:14 Oh yeah, his avatars have always been Munchy.
00:02:15 I forgot about that.
00:02:16 Yeah, that's awesome.
00:02:17 So his influence is felt to this very day.
00:02:19 And he's here to just talk about whatever.
00:02:22 So the subject of this week's, yeah, that brings us to the topic of this week's discussion
00:02:27 which is memes that need to die.
00:02:30 So yeah, you know, I've had a problem with the use of the term meme.
00:02:36 It's been really bastardized these days to mean funny image macros has become the definition
00:02:41 of meme.
00:02:42 And frankly, it's official now.
00:02:43 Like everyone uses it that way including me.
00:02:46 But the real definition is like an idea, it's like a little nugget thing that's like a consistent
00:02:51 joke or whatever.
00:02:52 And so we're going to talk about once the guy I go.
00:02:54 They are no longer welcome in this world.
00:02:56 So yeah.
00:02:57 So anybody who's got one to start us off.
00:03:00 Okay, I got a powerful one.
00:03:02 Munchy I believe has the big list.
00:03:04 Okay, shoot, shoot.
00:03:05 The one that I have highlighted and underlined and circled is the meme that Pizza Hut is
00:03:10 bad.
00:03:12 People who think that Pizza Hut is bad need to fucking kill themselves.
00:03:16 Pizza Hut is a great bargain.
00:03:18 You can get delicious stuffed crust, cheese crust, and it's just there's like one right
00:03:24 next to my house.
00:03:25 It's fucking great.
00:03:27 And if you don't think so, then you need to leave.
00:03:29 You know what?
00:03:30 I'm kind of with you on this.
00:03:32 I'm sure I'm not surprised at all by that.
00:03:34 Now is that in comparison to other pizza places, other speedy pizza places or just
00:03:39 No, no, just in general, we find it.
00:03:41 If you think that Pizza Hut is bad, bad food, then I think there's a problem with you.
00:03:46 And I think we need to take out your brain and put in a frog's brain.
00:03:50 Yeah, I can buy that.
00:03:51 I'm with you, man, because like, you know, I love pizza.
00:03:55 I would consider myself on some level a pizza like a fish and natto and stuff.
00:04:01 I go around, I eat pizza from all over the place and I don't, I don't like there are
00:04:05 pizza places I've been to that are legitimately disgusting where it's like I don't want to
00:04:10 eat this pizza ever again.
00:04:12 Pizza Hut does not fall into that category.
00:04:15 Sometimes I've gotten them and it hasn't been great.
00:04:18 They've got, you know, the pan pizza, that shit can start to like, if you eat enough
00:04:22 of those, it just starts like eating away at your throat.
00:04:24 I don't know what it is.
00:04:25 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:04:26 They're very like, greasy, spongy stuff.
00:04:28 I mean, it tastes great, but it will eventually start to erode your.
00:04:33 Just after watching so much of H3H3 videos at their whole Papa John's thing, I had Papa
00:04:38 John's the other week and did not enjoy it very much.
00:04:41 Papa John's is not any better than the pizza.
00:04:45 I actually like Papa John's, but it's probably different.
00:04:49 Did they have those in England?
00:04:50 Yeah, they have them.
00:04:51 I didn't know that.
00:04:52 Yeah, but they're really good at it.
00:04:54 I just came back and I feel like talking about food.
00:04:59 Yeah, they got, I'm starving as well.
00:05:02 I just came back.
00:05:04 Well, I've been to, I just had to say I wanted to talk, I want to talk about Pizza Hut a little
00:05:09 bit more because I've been to Pizza Hut in the Philippines and it's a pretty interesting
00:05:14 experience because it's treated like a classy restaurant there because pizza is so expensive,
00:05:20 like comparatively, because it costs the same amount there as it does here, but their money
00:05:24 is worth like far less than ours.
00:05:27 So you know, trying to pay the same amount for a pizza is like going to a high-class
00:05:31 restaurant.
00:05:32 So like, I was going to say, getting them in Japan, like not only are they super expensive,
00:05:36 they're fucking tiny, they're tiny little things, they're not an American-sized pizza
00:05:41 for sure.
00:05:42 Because I ordered a medium one time and I was able to eat the entire thing by myself.
00:05:48 That's not something I can normally say of a medium-sized pizza.
00:05:51 That's because Asias are small though and we're big eats.
00:05:55 That's true.
00:05:57 Okay, Gib, you got one.
00:06:00 Oh, I do.
00:06:03 Get good.
00:06:04 G-I-T-G-U-D.
00:06:05 I actually consider this a my list as well.
00:06:08 Oh, really?
00:06:09 This is a Gib classic.
00:06:11 Well, I've always had a problem with this ever since it's really become a thing because
00:06:16 it sort of promotes the idea that if someone's having trouble, you should ridicule them for
00:06:21 it because it's not really used as, it's like the most aggravating way to say you can do
00:06:27 it, you know, which is what people would be saying, but it just makes everyone angry.
00:06:32 For example, I believe in the game that shall not be named when you were facing that really
00:06:37 hard boss at the end.
00:06:38 I believe I used the phrase get good numerous times and you were getting extremely angry.
00:06:42 Yes, I had a big rent at you for that.
00:06:46 Well, I remember.
00:06:47 My biggest problem with the phrase get good is when it's used as a defense of criticism
00:06:52 because anytime you were to say like, man, this game sucks, everyone will say, you just
00:06:59 suck at it.
00:07:00 You're just not good.
00:07:01 Like people, it's a defense mechanism for people who don't want to admit that there
00:07:05 might be like that other people even might find there to be a flaw in a game you like.
00:07:12 You just say, well, you're not, you're just not good at it, which I mean, in fairness,
00:07:17 if what you're saying is I'm not good at enjoying the game, then maybe you're right.
00:07:21 If that could be considered a skill, you know, I will come and say I'm bullshit.
00:07:25 And then the thing about that is, is just that like those people have almost always
00:07:30 like really immersed themselves in that game and they've invested the time in when it comes
00:07:33 to like games, you really get out of it when you put into it in terms of enjoyment.
00:07:37 So like you could play a game like Ground Zeroes, like for hundreds of hours, even though
00:07:41 you can beat it in like an hour and you're done, but like it's all about what do you
00:07:44 want to do.
00:07:45 So I'm with you though.
00:07:46 I'm with in general itself.
00:07:47 I just think it's a matter of like, I appreciate that those people can have fun with the game
00:07:51 that much, but it's like, it's like they're denying that there's other ways to play it.
00:07:56 You know, like.
00:07:57 Yeah, I know what you mean.
00:07:58 How could you like, oh, you didn't enjoy it.
00:08:00 It just means you suck and your opinion is now invalid.
00:08:04 You know, I hear it more often when it's just like somebody's getting frustrated because
00:08:09 I get frustrated at games.
00:08:10 Everybody says it would like Dark Souls, for example, it's a Souls thing for me because
00:08:15 whenever I get annoyed at a thing and I, you know, I don't usually publicly say, I hate
00:08:22 this game because I suck at it because that's stupid.
00:08:24 Why would you do that?
00:08:25 But, you know, if I ever see someone else getting told to get good, I'm just like,
00:08:30 it's just, it's really annoys me because yeah, it's pretty counterproductive.
00:08:36 I mean, it doesn't like mean anything.
00:08:39 It's yeah, it's just, I don't know.
00:08:40 I don't know how to explain.
00:08:41 It's like, what do you, what do you expect me to do after you told me to get good?
00:08:45 Am I supposed to just now like, oh, okay, thanks.
00:08:49 I didn't realize I had to get good.
00:08:50 It's equivalent to you mad, bro.
00:08:53 It's just right.
00:08:54 It is, you know, I disagree a little bit because I'm a big believer in trial by fire
00:08:59 and I want people to get mad at games and get, and get, I want, I want them to experience
00:09:03 the, the Jesse Wood Demon Souls experience of like, no, I'm not going to let this game
00:09:07 fucking beat me.
00:09:08 And I like to think that get good is just one way, you know, there's different styles
00:09:14 of learning and stuff.
00:09:15 Like I, I think hippo, like myself, I think is effective on me for example.
00:09:19 I think it does fuel me in the right way.
00:09:21 I know hippo is in particular, hippo is very like contrarian in mindset like that of like,
00:09:27 like that kind of reverse psychology doesn't work on hippo because he's just going to get
00:09:32 mad at you and doubly not want to play the game.
00:09:36 And as for me, I'm more like, I just am so unaffected, like for me, a game has to appeal
00:09:41 to me and I don't feel any like narrative self with the game, you know, I guess with
00:09:47 Dark Souls a little bit because I love the game so much that I was willing to put myself
00:09:52 through learning it, you know, like, and that's why with Dark Souls three, I'm like,
00:09:57 trying to go in blind for once and like, be able to actually have like that experience,
00:10:02 but only because I'm already so invested in it that there's no way I'd ever not play
00:10:06 the game, you know, like there's, there's no convict.
00:10:09 Like if I complained that it was too hard and you said get good, like it wouldn't change
00:10:12 the fact that I was already playing.
00:10:14 And I just like to point out to everyone listening that this is proof that Digi's
00:10:17 stance on spoilers is not always the case.
00:10:20 He is now proving himself wrong.
00:10:22 Please don't go back this.
00:10:24 I believe me.
00:10:26 I suffer through that a lot.
00:10:29 Like I've watched that video multiple times.
00:10:31 I'm glad Munchie's around because Munchie's watched like every podcast I've ever been
00:10:36 in so he can anytime there's a topic he knows we've talked about too much.
00:10:40 He can step in and I guess we could say that.
00:10:44 Yeah, Munchie's wanted to be in one of these for a while.
00:10:46 So it's good.
00:10:47 Munchie has been in one of these.
00:10:49 It just hasn't come out yet.
00:10:50 Oh yeah, that's true.
00:10:51 That's true.
00:10:52 Maybe one day Ben will finish editing that thing.
00:10:55 He said he's working on it.
00:10:56 Yeah, he said he's fine with it.
00:10:58 OK, who's next?
00:10:59 I like all of you.
00:11:00 You got one?
00:11:00 Any of them should die.
00:11:01 I'm just here to be a contrarian.
00:11:05 I see.
00:11:06 That's glad to have that on board.
00:11:09 Who did you?
00:11:10 Do you got one?
00:11:11 She's completely skip over him.
00:11:14 Yeah, I guess if you're going to say good.
00:11:17 I like it in regards to when someone doesn't realize that there that skill is
00:11:21 even a relevant variable of the situation, you know, something like that.
00:11:25 Like, why the heck do girls like me something like that?
00:11:28 Do you think it's not their fault?
00:11:29 Hey, get good.
00:11:30 Like, oh, really?
00:11:30 It's me. OK.
00:11:32 Well, the view, you know, I suppose in that way that is true, I suppose.
00:11:36 The view, I think I think you're going to.
00:11:39 I think you're going to come back on your stance when I say the mean.
00:11:41 Yeah, I'm also I'm also here.
00:11:43 You're going to be open mind thinking, well, I can't think of any means
00:11:46 that needs to die, but now I'm here.
00:11:48 I think you're going to be really on my side.
00:11:51 Oh, the meme view.
00:11:52 There's a few and we're not.
00:11:54 We don't need to get too deep into this, because I've talked about it before.
00:11:57 But the meme of objective criticism, I guess if that's a mean,
00:12:00 I don't really.
00:12:01 Yeah, that's a good one.
00:12:04 Well, it's a cultural idea that we're going to use the traditional
00:12:08 definition and yeah, lots of them need to die.
00:12:11 But if we're talking about internet memes, that's a bait and switch.
00:12:14 You we're using we're using memes in the sense of how Jesse constantly
00:12:19 uses the phrase X is a meme that needs to die about literally.
00:12:23 Well, I thought that I trained him in those ways.
00:12:26 That was only so I kind of had the mindset this was just going to be like,
00:12:30 I mean, like the Pizza Hut not being good food.
00:12:33 Like that's not really like a meme meme, but it's like an idea.
00:12:36 It's an idea.
00:12:37 Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:39 It's something that a lot of people seem to agree with on the basis
00:12:42 that it's something other people have said a lot.
00:12:44 Let's let's make that our definition of room for this.
00:12:47 Something that an idea that has been proliferated through culture
00:12:51 because of the fact that people keep saying it when it's not necessarily
00:12:55 that everyone like has come.
00:12:57 Like, I don't think most of the people saying Pizza Hut is bad
00:12:59 are like everyone individually coming to the conclusion that Pizza Hut is bad.
00:13:04 I think it's more of like, you know, that I think you guys would agree with.
00:13:09 It's it's something that I would like bring in as a problem
00:13:12 if I was ever a guest on the biggest problem, but it's kind of a big one.
00:13:15 So we can come back to me whenever you want.
00:13:17 I don't know, but I guess I'll just go and then we can do you after.
00:13:22 I could finish up my objective criticism.
00:13:24 Yeah, please. Go ahead. Go ahead.
00:13:26 And it's the reason I consider it a meme is that it's one of those things
00:13:30 that people throw at you, especially if you are a critic.
00:13:32 You get it in your comments.
00:13:34 You get it in your messages all the time.
00:13:36 And people use it like like that's just how it is.
00:13:39 Like people say this review is not very objective or like a good review
00:13:44 is supposed to be objective or just anything like any use of the phrase
00:13:48 objective in my comments.
00:13:50 I'm like, why? Why do you assume that's what I'm going for?
00:13:54 Or that that's what all criticism is or that that's even what the world is?
00:13:59 You know, well, I'm not prejudiced.
00:14:00 You know, I don't objectify games.
00:14:02 I think all games should be equal.
00:14:04 So my reviews, yeah, it's really problematic to have any kind of standard.
00:14:10 You know what I said in a comment or games?
00:14:12 They're all I said, just recently, he was like, you criticize roller coaster
00:14:16 three with your own subjective opinions.
00:14:19 And I was like, I think it's objectively true that this game annoys me.
00:14:23 There. Boom. That's all you have to say.
00:14:27 That is true. I cracked the code.
00:14:29 You see, you know, because did you just want to touch on this real quick?
00:14:32 Sometimes when we that's true.
00:14:34 Well, sometimes when we, you and I argue about subjectivity and objectivity,
00:14:37 I think the thing gets lost is that there really are some things that are objective
00:14:41 and they're kind of what Davoo was saying.
00:14:43 And they're sort of well, according to your subjective human observation
00:14:47 that now see that's not that's not true, because it is it is an undisputable fact
00:14:51 that I am thinking the thing that I'm thinking right now that that can't be
00:14:54 how do I know that?
00:14:56 Well, how can you know that I do know that I exist?
00:15:02 I know that for a fact.
00:15:03 You can't prove that I guess I sort of having the same thing that you normally
00:15:07 have that I know in regards to what is it?
00:15:10 Determinism, you guys have the opposite philosophy when it comes to that issue
00:15:15 about how if something can't be objectively proven, then it doesn't exist.
00:15:19 We actually we've sort of a new agreement on that, I think.
00:15:22 My position is that I am a fragment of Munchie's imagination.
00:15:27 You're welcome to that. You can do that.
00:15:29 I think my favorite hippo quote is the figment talks how I am thinking.
00:15:35 That's what he said about me one time for him.
00:15:37 No, I'm for him.
00:15:39 When did I say that?
00:15:40 He said it said it at Brodycon.
00:15:42 You're like, you talk how I think.
00:15:44 Oh, yeah, I don't wear that on my shirt.
00:15:47 It was cool. Oh, oh, I get it.
00:15:48 Because Munchie will just like smunch it out.
00:15:50 Oh, he's like, you know, he's like, you know, he's like, you know, the same thing.
00:15:53 Yeah. Well, he's the voice in his head.
00:15:56 That's brilliant.
00:16:00 All right, so let me let me throw one out there.
00:16:02 OK, here's a classic traditional meme
00:16:05 that that really needs to die.
00:16:07 OK, it's it's the overuse of the term Sempai.
00:16:12 It has been with you for rated to the point of absolute.
00:16:15 I hate every time I say and I really blame PewDiePie.
00:16:18 Not really not PewDiePie, but PewDiePie's audience, I think,
00:16:21 is the ones that made it happen because he's been using it for a while now.
00:16:24 And it's like it's like fucking like kids.
00:16:27 Use that explains me.
00:16:29 God, that explains so much
00:16:31 because I was really wondering how that became such a thing.
00:16:33 And if it's PewDiePie, I believe that really makes sense.
00:16:36 Because like it might have come directly through a yandere simulator.
00:16:39 I think was like the the thing that started it off.
00:16:41 Yeah, it's I mean, it's too recent, dude.
00:16:43 Senpai obviously is just a Japanese word.
00:16:46 It's just a word. It's a word.
00:16:49 So what's weird about it is that, like, notice me, Senpai,
00:16:54 like people now talk about it like it's this unbelievably prolific
00:16:59 Jap like anime cliche and it never really has been like it's not a thing.
00:17:03 You hear a lot in anime.
00:17:05 Usually most characters are in the same grade.
00:17:08 There's not a ton of shows where like it's girls pining after their Senpai.
00:17:13 That's like like I can't even think off the top of my head of a good example
00:17:17 of a notice me Senpai show.
00:17:19 So like that's why it kind of got weird to me because people kept saying like,
00:17:23 haha, is this like one of those notice me Senpai anime?
00:17:26 Well, like what is that?
00:17:27 That's not a thing.
00:17:28 That's like, yeah, I'm sure there's one anime has, but it's not true.
00:17:33 I don't even care.
00:17:34 I don't even care how specific it is.
00:17:36 The problem isn't how specific it is.
00:17:37 The problem is the overuse and the way that like it's been
00:17:41 God, it's been completely ruined.
00:17:42 I cannot hear the word Senpai in anime anymore.
00:17:45 I'm thinking of like the PewDiePie comments section.
00:17:47 It's a nice thing.
00:17:48 Notice me. Senpai is something that I you could possibly hear at like E3
00:17:53 by some really by some fucking.
00:17:56 Yeah, that's right.
00:17:57 That's right.
00:17:58 That's what it's totally like when like the marketing department
00:18:01 of a games company starts using that phrase like in their marketing.
00:18:05 That's when you know, you've got a dead meme on your hands.
00:18:07 And it's or there was a hot topic that said it as Maddox.
00:18:12 See, OK, that is right there.
00:18:13 Proof that is 100.
00:18:15 No, I didn't say that there was one.
00:18:16 I said if there was one, because that's Maddox.
00:18:19 That whole article about how when anything that makes it a hot topic
00:18:22 is officially a dead like yeah, yeah.
00:18:26 But yeah, I think with the Senpai thing, it's also weird because,
00:18:31 like you said, it's been used so much that it doesn't mean anything now.
00:18:35 And I think a lot of people use it to mean like like person
00:18:38 who is more popular than me.
00:18:40 Yeah, I do.
00:18:41 People on YouTube all the time that refer to like YouTube content creators
00:18:44 as their senpai, see it in my comments.
00:18:46 And I'm always like, do that shit.
00:18:48 I don't understand how I am your Senpai.
00:18:50 Like, where is the logical thread just that more people know who I am?
00:18:54 Does that make me an upperclassman?
00:18:56 Like, is it that I've been?
00:18:57 I think that makes enough sense.
00:18:59 Am I older than you?
00:19:00 What does it mean?
00:19:01 Where what makes me your Senpai?
00:19:03 You're better than no one did you, so it can't be that one.
00:19:05 That's true. That's true.
00:19:06 It's just I mean, it's understandable more when like
00:19:09 because we were making fun of Jeff for messaging
00:19:12 Demolition D and saying, yeah, right, which is something that people say
00:19:15 to Demolition D all the time and especially content creators.
00:19:19 And I see why he made himself look like a total scrub.
00:19:23 Right. I get why content creators do it because we're like,
00:19:26 well, Demo has more subs than us and we kind of do the same thing as him.
00:19:29 So he's kind of like our Senpai.
00:19:31 I get that.
00:19:32 But there's people who will leave comments on his videos,
00:19:35 like, notice me, Senpai.
00:19:37 And it's like, in what way is he your Senpai?
00:19:39 What class are you in together?
00:19:41 You know, like, what school are you going to?
00:19:44 I don't know. All right.
00:19:44 Yeah, it's it's your body on a slightly different level about this than me.
00:19:48 But OK, we can both agree.
00:19:49 It's well, I'm annoyed on the level you are, too, that it's just everywhere.
00:19:52 But like, I also just I hate when there's memes
00:19:56 that don't have like a strong logical thread behind them.
00:20:00 Like when people start using it in context where it doesn't make sense anymore.
00:20:04 Yeah, like, hey, would you like a muffin?
00:20:06 For instance, Jesse, like Jesse keeps using the phrase
00:20:11 like you can't teach that.
00:20:14 And I still I still find it funny because he always uses it in a situation
00:20:18 where it's like, and you can't teach that.
00:20:20 And you're like, ah, because it's something that comes natural, you know.
00:20:24 But like, yeah, when if you started saying like everything you do,
00:20:29 you're like, oh, I just got a headshot.
00:20:31 You can't teach that.
00:20:32 And it's like, what the fuck?
00:20:33 No, you can teach that. You can teach that.
00:20:39 Now, see, I kind of like that one.
00:20:41 I just got an A on my test.
00:20:43 And you can't that's why it's still pure.
00:20:45 You still like it because you haven't heard it that much
00:20:47 because Jesse's the only one really doing it all the time.
00:20:50 That's true.
00:20:51 In fact, the mere discussion of these would have any small meme
00:20:55 is only going to make it worse.
00:20:56 So perhaps we're doing a disservice to the world by just coming to rules, too, by the way.
00:21:02 Yeah, don't I.
00:21:03 Well, we already covered ironic comments or commenting things we don't want to hear
00:21:07 is a banable offense, so don't do it.
00:21:09 I want to go for a shadow man.
00:21:10 Shitposting. Oh, by the way, just to alleviate
00:21:13 maybe some of the concerns of our audience, I think we've only banned
00:21:15 like one guy on this channel.
00:21:18 And it's like, I'm pretty sure the only person who's been banned
00:21:23 was the guy who said that Jesse should be removed.
00:21:25 Now that they know if no one responds to them, they might be shadow banned.
00:21:28 They're living in fear all the time.
00:21:30 They just don't know what I would do is I would have a friend of mine
00:21:33 comment on one of my comments just to know if it was happening.
00:21:36 So if you're living in that fear, I mean, you should you should be afraid from now on.
00:21:40 But I think people were worried that we were already banning people
00:21:43 before like warning them about the comment to rules.
00:21:46 And it's like, no, we gave you some leeway for now.
00:21:49 But when that guy said, why can't you like, why don't you ban Jesse from the podcast?
00:21:53 That was when we I think that's the only guy we ban.
00:21:55 That's no good because because he didn't seem to understand
00:21:58 that Jesse also has access to the channel.
00:22:02 He broke so many rules with that one comment.
00:22:04 Yeah, it's it's no good.
00:22:06 Well, that's it for mine. Who's got another one?
00:22:09 Oh, Munchy, I'm sure you've got more.
00:22:11 I have a ton of more. OK, let me pick.
00:22:13 OK, OK, SJW slash Tumblr.
00:22:18 Core, I wanted Jesse to be here for this.
00:22:20 This also was on my potential list.
00:22:22 Yeah. OK, all right.
00:22:24 Go on. If you see a show that has a cal arts
00:22:28 art style and any like when I say that something comes in your head,
00:22:33 if you like Steven Universe is what you're talking about.
00:22:35 Yeah. Yeah.
00:22:36 If you see in public, a disgusting Steven Universe.
00:22:39 Yeah, being public cat shit.
00:22:41 And your first reaction is to just collect Tumblr core.
00:22:45 Then I think I need to put you down on the ground.
00:22:48 I need to put you into space.
00:22:49 I think your head needs to come off your shoulders.
00:22:51 I think I need to do some bodily harm to you.
00:22:54 That's so that's fair.
00:22:55 That's very fair, Munchy, because I also am extremely angry
00:22:58 when people dismiss a show like that just for its art style
00:23:01 without giving it a fair shake.
00:23:02 And it doesn't fucking mean anything. It's nothing.
00:23:06 Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.
00:23:07 I mean, the thing about Tumblr is that like it's a social media on
00:23:12 if you look at it on a broad enough scale, everything is Tumblr core
00:23:16 because there's there's Tumblr fans of literally everything.
00:23:20 You know, there's blogs for anything.
00:23:22 Most porn could easily be considered Tumblr core
00:23:25 because there's so much porn tumblers out there that like,
00:23:28 you know, Jesse is apparently here.
00:23:31 Bring him in. Oh, good.
00:23:32 Let's let's invite him in.
00:23:34 He needs to be a part of this particular problem.
00:23:36 Agreed. I need to brush my teeth.
00:23:39 OK, but, you know, just to clarify, I think when people say this,
00:23:42 I think they're mostly talking about the intersection between
00:23:44 like the SJW core and the Tumblr core.
00:23:47 I think that's the thing that comes to Jesse, Jesse, we're talking about
00:23:51 memes that we do die.
00:23:52 And the current meme is people calling stuff Tumblr core based on its art style.
00:23:57 Yeah, so I got a meme for you.
00:23:59 I got I got a meme that needs to die.
00:24:03 Yeah, us doing these at four in the fucking afternoon.
00:24:08 Oh, yeah, because four in the afternoon is such an inconvenient time.
00:24:10 It's the most inconvenient time. Who would be awake if you do it at a respectable hour?
00:24:14 Like four in the morning when I'm awake.
00:24:18 Jesse, you're recording, right?
00:24:20 Cool. Can I point out that memes that need to die
00:24:22 is itself now a meme is being more than wanting it to non-internet memes.
00:24:26 We're just applying it to society in general.
00:24:30 No, no. No, no.
00:24:31 This means works.
00:24:33 Me and Jesse have been using it back and forth for a while.
00:24:34 And that's been a great meme.
00:24:36 And that's why I already accused X meme needs to die of being a meme
00:24:40 that needs to die on a previous podcast.
00:24:43 And then I made a comment, I think in the chat.
00:24:45 I think you said that in the chat as well.
00:24:47 I made a comment that that was a meme that needed to die.
00:24:50 And then what I said you did, but those are all funny goofs
00:24:53 because I love this meme and I don't want it to die.
00:24:55 I made this podcast and it might become one.
00:24:57 I need this meme to die because of the fact that Jesse says it so much
00:25:01 that now it's like it's in my head all the time.
00:25:04 Every time I get mad at anything on the internet, I'm like,
00:25:07 just fucking this meme needs to die.
00:25:09 Or like, I've been walking around my house.
00:25:12 I've like opened the fridge and there's no milk.
00:25:14 And I'm like, this whole not having any look at your page to die.
00:25:17 You passed it by a car.
00:25:18 Well, we'll get into that.
00:25:20 It isn't me that needs to die.
00:25:21 Having higher patronage than me.
00:25:24 I just surpassed you by a dollar.
00:25:25 Four videos you've made.
00:25:27 Oh, I'm I'm raking up the page around, baby.
00:25:31 Oh, yeah, come slash Ben, saying yeah.
00:25:34 Yeah, it's my catch.
00:25:36 Actually, Ben just made a great catchphrase and no one should steal it.
00:25:39 It's mine. It's the best meme.
00:25:42 It's the name.
00:25:43 It's a meme I need to list for a hundred years.
00:25:47 We do need to talk about Ben Saints,
00:25:49 Patreon, though, because he just made this amazing Brunswick comic
00:25:52 and has no new patrons.
00:25:55 Oh, well, it's Pokemon.
00:25:56 Everyone go to Ben, no, SaintComics.com,
00:25:59 patreon.com, Ben, Saint, go read it, go watch it.
00:26:02 It's another story.
00:26:04 It's really cool.
00:26:05 If you like Pokemon, if you people like Pokemon,
00:26:07 which I know you do, if you're watching this,
00:26:09 go to Ben, SaintComics.com, read this comic.
00:26:11 It's a really touching and emotional short story
00:26:14 that is really cool and well drawn.
00:26:16 And he gained he gained more views on it
00:26:19 than anything he's made ever, but no patrons at all.
00:26:23 So who even gives a shit?
00:26:24 Right. No one.
00:26:25 I start the comic as the right.
00:26:28 So the meme that we're on is Tumblr for.
00:26:31 Munchy and SJW.
00:26:33 Good old Munchwick.
00:26:35 Yes. OK.
00:26:37 But we can let's we can move on.
00:26:38 I think we all get the gist.
00:26:39 Yeah, I got all right.
00:26:42 Here's that one.
00:26:43 Neutrality worship.
00:26:46 Ding, applause, applause, applause.
00:26:48 Neutrality worship. All right.
00:26:49 No, no, you fuck you get right out of here.
00:26:53 Oh, because that's that's pure Jesse.
00:26:54 That's pure Jesse right there.
00:26:55 Oh, it's cool to not give a shit about anything.
00:26:58 Neutrality is the best light.
00:27:00 It's the it's the one true path in life.
00:27:02 It's the only thing that makes sense.
00:27:03 I don't think Davoo's talking about
00:27:05 neutrality as in like, I don't care about anything.
00:27:08 He's talking about when when people
00:27:11 when there's two opposite two opposing sides on an issue
00:27:14 and everyone's like, oh, shouldn't we just meet somewhere in the middle?
00:27:17 That's obviously where the answer is when sometimes it's obviously where the answer is.
00:27:21 To say anything else is fucking retarded.
00:27:23 Oh, Jesse.
00:27:24 So you're you're you're if I say the two plus two is
00:27:27 you say to the problem with society is the other guys, right?
00:27:31 It's always the other team.
00:27:32 We got it. They're the ones making everything bad for everyone.
00:27:35 That's so fucking childish and stupid.
00:27:38 It's such baby logic.
00:27:39 Oh, we got it. No, you're wrong, Jesse.
00:27:41 You're dead wrong on this.
00:27:43 You've been for a while. Can I ask you guys a question?
00:27:45 Hey, Jesse, what's your stance on spoilers?
00:27:48 Don't don't don't.
00:27:50 What? I don't give a shit about spoilers.
00:27:51 Oh, that's so big of you.
00:27:53 That's so big of you to not give a shit, Jesse.
00:27:55 You're really the better man here.
00:27:58 No.
00:28:01 These fucking idiots, all 10 of them tried ganging up on me about
00:28:06 neutrality warship and not letting me explain what my actual point was,
00:28:10 not letting me get a word in.
00:28:12 And I was arguing with these morons for like 20 minutes before I realized
00:28:15 the recording had fucked up and none of it was even recorded.
00:28:18 So screw you.
00:28:19 I'm editing this and now you're going to listen to me, motherfucker.
00:28:22 These stupid fucking jackoffs.
00:28:23 They're all circle jerking about.
00:28:26 Neutrality warship is bad.
00:28:29 What about you have a stance on spoilers?
00:28:32 You obviously have a stance on something.
00:28:34 Yeah, great point, Digi.
00:28:35 That's not what I was fucking saying at all.
00:28:37 Has nothing to fucking do with my point.
00:28:39 Nobody is actually fucking listening to my point because they're all fucking
00:28:42 circle jerking and talking over each other and not letting me get a word
00:28:45 in edgewise.
00:28:46 This podcast is fucking terrible.
00:28:48 I hate these idiots.
00:28:49 They're not my friends.
00:28:50 They were never my friends.
00:28:51 I fucking quit the band forever.
00:28:53 I hate them.
00:28:54 They're fucking...
00:28:55 Oh my God.
00:28:56 It's so fucking impossible to even communicate in this stupid podcast
00:29:01 that we've created, that we've birthed through some vile satanic fucking ritual.
00:29:07 It never should have been created in the first place.
00:29:10 The PCP was a mistake.
00:29:12 It's nothing but trash, okay?
00:29:14 You put like eight of us in these fucking podcasts, which makes us all have
00:29:18 to fucking talk over each other and nobody can get a fucking word in edgewise.
00:29:22 It's finally you're talking.
00:29:23 When you're finally talking, you're fucking no.
00:29:25 You know that you're going to be interrupted.
00:29:27 So you have no choice but to get all...
00:29:30 You get all muddled up and you fucking have to scream your point.
00:29:33 And it just turns into a goddamn screaming clusterfuck.
00:29:36 I hate these idiots.
00:29:37 Oh my God.
00:29:38 They're sitting there.
00:29:39 They're not listening to what I was actually fucking saying about neutrality, okay?
00:29:43 DeVu brings in neutrality worship as a problem, as a meme that needs to die.
00:29:48 Oh, people.
00:29:49 Neutrality worship is not a fucking problem, and this is my fucking point.
00:29:55 Neutrality demonization is a fucking problem, okay?
00:29:59 Everybody thinks that you fucking have to have an opinion on everything.
00:30:03 Everybody thinks that you have to go out and vote for a rigged system that doesn't represent you.
00:30:08 If you don't vote, then you can't complain.
00:30:11 You're either a liberal or a conservative.
00:30:14 You're either a feminist social justice warrior, or you're an MRA neckbeard.
00:30:19 You're either one thing or the other thing.
00:30:21 You can't be anywhere in between.
00:30:23 There's no such thing as a nuanced issue anymore.
00:30:26 Everything has to be black and white.
00:30:28 That's how much discourse has devolved.
00:30:30 That's how much people have fucking devolved.
00:30:33 Because they shame you for not picking a fucking side on everything.
00:30:37 They shame you for neutrality.
00:30:38 They shame you for apathy.
00:30:40 They shame you for being rational and seeing both sides of an issue.
00:30:45 And you know what that does?
00:30:47 It just folds over in on itself, and it compounds the issue and makes everything worse.
00:30:51 Because what it does is it encourages people who don't really have an interest in the topic,
00:30:57 or don't really understand the topic.
00:30:59 Well, they can't just sit on the sidelines.
00:31:01 They can't just, you know, think about it.
00:31:03 They have to pick a fucking side.
00:31:05 So you have all these uneducated fucking people who don't really know anything about the issue at hand,
00:31:10 who just need to pick a fucking side because that's what society expects of you now.
00:31:15 They'll fucking shame you if you don't have a fucking team behind you backing you up
00:31:19 with a big fucking foam finger that says,
00:31:21 Yeah, we're number one.
00:31:23 Fuck the other guys.
00:31:24 The other guys are at fault.
00:31:25 Kill the opposing team.
00:31:27 And it just encourages stupid people to start shouting each other down.
00:31:32 And it rewards that.
00:31:33 And it pedestalizes stupid people.
00:31:36 It pedestalizes idiocy.
00:31:38 And it shames intelligence because the intelligent people,
00:31:41 nine times out of ten, are the ones who aren't picking a fucking side.
00:31:45 They're the ones thinking critically,
00:31:47 but God forbid anyone think critically about anything
00:31:50 before jumping head first into the current socio-political debate.
00:31:55 We gotta get that fucking debate live and televised for everyone
00:31:59 with their fucking popcorn and their fat-gaping maws
00:32:02 while we watch the country tear itself apart from the inside out
00:32:06 because nobody can fucking be neutral anymore.
00:32:08 It's not politically correct to be neutral anymore.
00:32:11 You have to pick a fucking side.
00:32:13 Pick it now.
00:32:14 You fucking maggots.
00:32:16 You brainwashed, simple-minded, knee-jerking shitlords.
00:32:20 Fucking demonized rationality.
00:32:22 Demonized intelligence.
00:32:24 Pedestalized ignorance.
00:32:26 Pedestalized knee-jerking.
00:32:28 What are you fucking doing when you boo-hoo and whine and cry
00:32:31 about neutrality worship?
00:32:33 You know, every time there's a fucking issue in this country,
00:32:37 every time there's a fucking debate, what inevitably happens?
00:32:40 It ends up boiling down into two opposing, warring tribes of fucking shit-slinging apes
00:32:45 with nothing to fucking say.
00:32:47 Two screaming tribes of extremists on either side
00:32:50 drowning out the rational, logical, cool-headed people in the fucking middle.
00:32:55 Every single time, that's the fucking problem.
00:32:57 That's the meme that needs to die.
00:32:59 And you go, well, wait a minute.
00:33:01 Maybe we can sort of see where both sides are coming from
00:33:04 and kind of come to like a rational compromise.
00:33:07 Maybe the solution is more in the middle.
00:33:09 Maybe it's not on one of these two opposites.
00:33:11 Oh, no, that's neutrality worship.
00:33:14 Oh, God forbid someone be too neutral.
00:33:17 God forbid anyone not be a fucking extremist.
00:33:21 The whole fucking world has turned into a bunch of idiotic zealots
00:33:24 who can't wait to shove their bullshit down each other's throats
00:33:27 and shout each other down.
00:33:29 Oh, but apathy is somehow the problem, right?
00:33:31 You stupid fucking swine.
00:33:33 You make me sick.
00:33:34 You're fucking perpetuating this problem with your bullshit neutrality worship.
00:33:38 It's a meme that needs to die.
00:33:40 God damn it!
00:33:41 Bunch of fucking idiots.
00:33:43 Oh, you don't think neutrality worship is a problem?
00:33:46 So that means that you just think that you have to be neutral on everything
00:33:49 and not care about anything.
00:33:51 Would you stand on spoilers then, huh?
00:33:53 You obviously have a stance that...
00:33:55 God damn it, you fucking idiots.
00:33:57 Fuck you, Davoo.
00:33:58 Fuck your shitty problem.
00:34:00 It's not a meme that needs to die.
00:34:01 It's a meme that there needs to be more of.
00:34:03 Neutrality demonization is a meme that needs to die, buddy.
00:34:06 You're a meme that needs to die.
00:34:08 You all need to die because you're stupid.
00:34:10 This whole thing is stupid.
00:34:12 This whole podcast, all of you, all of my friends are stupid.
00:34:15 Stupid, stupid, stupid!
00:34:17 Anyways, now back to the podcast.
00:34:20 I got the meme.
00:34:22 Okay, what's the meme?
00:34:24 It's the meme, Gib.
00:34:26 No, no, no, Davoo, no, Dave.
00:34:28 Dude, how big is Bernie Sanders' dick, dude?
00:34:31 Yeah.
00:34:32 Go on, Gib, Gib, please.
00:34:34 The meme that needs to die the most is conflict.
00:34:37 I'm sick of it.
00:34:38 I understand all of this.
00:34:40 You fucking idiots.
00:34:42 Okay, you know what?
00:34:43 Alright, let me spin off this into one thing that's not really...
00:34:46 Guys, wait, my recording stopped like 10 minutes ago.
00:34:49 No, no!
00:34:51 Just start it now, just start it now, whatever.
00:34:53 We'll figure something out.
00:34:54 We'll just cut that entire obnoxious argument out of the episode.
00:34:57 We can do that, we can do that.
00:34:59 No, that wasn't obnoxious.
00:35:01 We can do it over and over again.
00:35:03 What do you want, Jesse? What are we supposed to do?
00:35:05 The meme that now needs to die is mistakes.
00:35:07 We have to fucking...
00:35:09 This podcast needs to die.
00:35:11 No, we can't. We're not doing that.
00:35:13 My name's Endless Jess and I hate all people who don't...
00:35:18 Alright, Jesse, Jesse, are you recording now?
00:35:20 Are you recording now?
00:35:22 I was recording. It wasn't my fault.
00:35:24 It stopped itself. My computer, all computers.
00:35:26 Computers are a meme.
00:35:28 Alright, we're not hearing any of this because I don't know if you're recording or not yet.
00:35:32 Are you recording now?
00:35:33 Yeah, probably.
00:35:34 Computers are a meme.
00:35:35 Okay, let's just sync it up real quick. Let's say one, two, three, fuck.
00:35:37 Okay, one, two, three, fuck.
00:35:40 We're gonna just cut out my...
00:35:42 Alright, we're good.
00:35:43 Well, what else can we do?
00:35:45 Anything else? The whole argument was predicated on everyone arguing and Jesse's part is gone.
00:35:49 We have to cut that entire probably 20-minute section.
00:35:53 Well, my board was the only part that matters, so I'll just re-record it myself.
00:35:57 Re-record it yourself and then add it in.
00:36:00 You'll be able to say whatever you want. You'll be able to make me look retarded.
00:36:04 It'll be funny. Go for it. Who cares? That sounds funny.
00:36:07 Okay, let me move on from that. Let's spin off to this because I got one that's related.
00:36:11 I got a big meme that needs to die, and it's the meme that children are people, okay?
00:36:17 The children are people. That is a total meme. It's not true.
00:36:20 You are not a human being until you're like 25.
00:36:23 And that's why I think that the abortion should be extended until 18.
00:36:27 I would have bought an 18-year-old who is not working outright.
00:36:29 I think that's totally fine.
00:36:31 I don't see any problem with that because they're not people and they don't matter.
00:36:34 It's just like putting down a dog, you know?
00:36:36 It's a job that you just had to do.
00:36:38 I know. It's a sad name for you, my friend, but that's just the way that cookie crumbles.
00:36:43 Exactly. You guys just got to restart this whole operation.
00:36:47 You're not managing the crowd here very well. You're not really doing well on getting people on your side.
00:36:52 Now, Sam, I'm trying to create a discussion here because I think you guys can agree that children aren't people and they don't matter.
00:37:02 I think...
00:37:04 Oh, here's neutrality worship again.
00:37:07 Forget the whole abortion thing.
00:37:09 Forget the abortion thing.
00:37:11 When I do it, it's matter.
00:37:13 It's the right of all society, but everyone else can do it.
00:37:16 And it's just a solution, right?
00:37:18 I told you from the beginning it was a solution.
00:37:20 Jesse's ranting about stuff that we had to cut from the podcast.
00:37:23 The only point that I wanted to make is the crux of this issue.
00:37:27 The reason that...
00:37:29 You wanted to cut out my part because you knew that I was right.
00:37:32 The reason why I'm not laughing at your whole position about 25 being the age that you can't get murdered is because I just know that we're just...
00:37:40 That's going to be an actual debate 15 years from now.
00:37:42 Oh, it's not murder. It's abortion.
00:37:44 And I can't wait for it.
00:37:46 I'll be an old man, and so it will matter to me.
00:37:49 And children, we all know children don't matter.
00:37:51 Because you're over 50.
00:37:53 That's fine. I'm not really opposed to the idea that...
00:37:57 If you really become a burden on everyone...
00:38:00 Actual societies in our world actually do approve of this kind of thing.
00:38:03 It's different periods of time, and I just know it's probably going to be a thing.
00:38:07 It's probably going to be a real thing here in America in like 100 years or something.
00:38:10 And so it's an actual thing that happens for some reason, even though it should be,
00:38:14 even though I'm the person with that kind of humor, it's just not funny to me.
00:38:17 Dang it.
00:38:19 Well, let me tell...
00:38:21 My real argument...
00:38:23 The real point I'm making here is the meme of children's opinions mattering.
00:38:27 Because there is nothing I give less of a shit about than what someone under
00:38:31 probably 21 at the earliest thinks about anything.
00:38:34 I agree with that. They don't matter.
00:38:36 Everyone under 25 is...
00:38:38 In my opinion, anyone over a day or under 120 who's not me,
00:38:41 I don't give a shit about their opinions. How about that?
00:38:43 Just listen to their opinion, and if it's retarded, dismiss it.
00:38:46 This is a real position. I want to legislate based on this.
00:38:49 I want it to be so parents are always right. Children's are always wrong.
00:38:53 I don't care. You got a kid crying like,
00:38:55 Oh, mommy, mommy, beat me up last night.
00:38:57 I'm covered in bruises like, shut the fuck up kid. Nobody gives a shit.
00:39:00 And we all reiterate the fact that Munchie is like 16, by the way.
00:39:03 No.
00:39:05 I forgot.
00:39:07 Yes, we can. Munchie, how old are you now? You're 15?
00:39:10 You're 15? You fucking liar.
00:39:13 That's no way that's true. You're like 7 feet tall.
00:39:15 He's got his repeater files.
00:39:17 Oh, shit. Oh, I'm sorry.
00:39:19 No, it's because Munchie is fucking Steven Universe,
00:39:22 so he's not aging properly. That's true.
00:39:24 He's the problem. He's 25, at least.
00:39:26 You gem things are all out of wave.
00:39:28 Except that...
00:39:30 Except that Munchie actually looks 25,
00:39:33 whereas Steven Universe... He really does.
00:39:35 ...the idea is that he looks like a child.
00:39:37 What is Steven Universe?
00:39:39 I don't even fucking know. He's me.
00:39:41 Nobody knows. He's him.
00:39:44 I'm somewhat...
00:39:46 I'm somewhat with you on this, Nate,
00:39:48 but I don't know where you're hearing this idea
00:39:51 that children need to be listened to.
00:39:53 I came up with it.
00:39:55 I have not heard people...
00:39:57 People listen to what children say about anything.
00:39:59 I think that's a mistake.
00:40:01 When do people do that?
00:40:03 When parents do what their children ask.
00:40:06 That's a problem.
00:40:08 I have a weird...
00:40:10 I feel uncomfortable talking to younger people
00:40:13 unless they like...
00:40:15 I can talk to Munchie, because Munchie...
00:40:18 Oh, God, my fucking window farting.
00:40:20 What the fuck was that shit?
00:40:22 It was my window farting.
00:40:24 Well, yeah, window farting.
00:40:26 Yeah.
00:40:28 Anyway...
00:40:30 Fuckin' dirty Sanders just came in here
00:40:32 and got a fucking...
00:40:34 He got a quick promo on that.
00:40:36 Got a fresh political fart.
00:40:38 I can talk to someone like Munchie,
00:40:41 because Munchie has expressed himself in a way
00:40:46 that is similar enough to an adult
00:40:49 and understands where his limitations are
00:40:53 in terms of how much he knows.
00:40:55 I've talked to Munchie and had the impression
00:40:57 that you understand that maybe there's some things
00:41:00 you don't know about the world
00:41:02 and don't have an opinion on,
00:41:04 but there's other things you do,
00:41:06 and you tend to talk about things you know,
00:41:09 and I think that's cool.
00:41:11 I talk to some teenagers sometimes
00:41:13 who act like they believe they are already adults,
00:41:17 and it really feels weird to me,
00:41:20 because I can see all the gaps.
00:41:22 I can see...
00:41:24 When a teenager talks to me, I know it's a teenager.
00:41:27 There's no disconnect where I'm like,
00:41:29 oh, wow, you really sound like an adult,
00:41:31 but they'll talk about issues and stuff
00:41:34 like they're an adult, and I'm like,
00:41:36 how do you even talk about this?
00:41:38 You have not experienced this yet.
00:41:41 People thinking they know more than they do.
00:41:43 Regardless of their age, just make that the rule.
00:41:45 Like, hey, only say stuff that you actually know about.
00:41:47 Don't pretend to know what you don't know.
00:41:49 Just be fine with being ignorant.
00:41:51 Or at least admit that you don't...
00:41:53 Say something like, hey...
00:41:55 Look, I have seen people who are 90 million years old
00:41:57 and are ignorant about things, but they don't realize it.
00:41:59 This is something that applies to all ages.
00:42:01 Maybe it's just not equally,
00:42:03 but there's plenty of old people who just get really set in their ways.
00:42:05 It's more so when it's...
00:42:07 When it's a young person,
00:42:09 it's more usually that they don't realize that
00:42:11 reading about it and hearing about it
00:42:13 doesn't mean that they know as much as everyone else.
00:42:17 Well, also just that like...
00:42:19 I've seen a lot of head ties, so I know how to pick up girls.
00:42:21 Alright, good man.
00:42:23 The thing about teenagers to me...
00:42:25 You trip over a stick, you crash a rounder into a corner,
00:42:27 your penis enters the vagina as it happens, you know?
00:42:30 That's just how it goes down.
00:42:32 You take responsibility.
00:42:34 I know the thing that makes me...
00:42:36 God damn it.
00:42:38 The thing that makes it harder for me to listen to teenagers
00:42:40 talk particularly about their problems
00:42:42 and thoughts on the world, like broader stuff.
00:42:44 Well, not that they don't matter,
00:42:46 but that they're gonna change not too long from now.
00:42:49 I know that for me,
00:42:52 graduating high school,
00:42:54 I considerably changed my mindset about the world,
00:42:58 because once you have freedom
00:43:00 to do whatever the fuck you want,
00:43:02 even if you just go to college,
00:43:04 as soon as you get that freedom,
00:43:06 it immediately starts changing the way you think about stuff,
00:43:08 because you just have such different concerns,
00:43:10 and it broadens your scope of what things matter to you.
00:43:16 As a teenager, politically,
00:43:18 you might be interested in a lot of social issues
00:43:21 and have no interest in economic issues, for instance.
00:43:25 Whereas once you're an adult,
00:43:27 economic issues immediately affect you.
00:43:30 And I think DeVu would agree
00:43:32 that he would love to hear more people concerned
00:43:34 about economic issues.
00:43:36 But I think as a teenager,
00:43:39 I hear them talk about stuff that's like,
00:43:42 I just don't understand why people act this way,
00:43:45 and I'm like, once you're out of high school,
00:43:47 nobody acts that way.
00:43:49 People are so phony, dude.
00:43:51 People are so phony all the time.
00:43:53 I'm the only one who's real.
00:43:55 I'm not bad that often,
00:43:57 but when people talk about their issues,
00:43:59 I'm like, there's so many problems that you can have
00:44:01 that you will just simply grow out of,
00:44:03 especially artistically.
00:44:05 People not knowing what they want to do artistically.
00:44:08 Once you turn 20,
00:44:10 and you've been out of school for a little while,
00:44:12 then it becomes a pressing issue.
00:44:14 I don't know. I think that may not be the case.
00:44:17 I know people who are 20-something
00:44:19 and still are stuck in that mindset.
00:44:21 Dude, when I was 22,
00:44:23 I had no idea what I wanted to do.
00:44:25 It wasn't a matter of your development
00:44:27 as much as a situation that arose
00:44:29 or just certain things that happened to you.
00:44:31 What was the band that did that song?
00:44:33 High school never ends.
00:44:35 The whole point of that song is actually,
00:44:37 I can't wait to be out of these problems
00:44:39 and these stupid issues and these stupid people,
00:44:41 but then I graduate high school and everything's still the same.
00:44:43 So I guess it's bullshit.
00:44:45 It really depends on what stuff you're referring to.
00:44:48 Because I have a friend who's in the military
00:44:50 and he's always like, this is just high school all over again.
00:44:52 Yeah, the people might be like high school
00:44:55 and I remind you of that,
00:44:56 but your concerns are not the same.
00:44:59 Your monetary concerns,
00:45:01 when you're in the military,
00:45:02 are not the same as high school.
00:45:04 You're not thinking about,
00:45:08 let's say you get really emotional
00:45:10 because a girl dumped you.
00:45:12 In high school,
00:45:13 that's the most important thing going on in your life
00:45:15 because everything else is just happening automatically.
00:45:17 When you're in high school,
00:45:19 unless you're really bad at school
00:45:21 and you do lots of extra stuff to even make it through,
00:45:24 or if you're really someone who takes school so seriously
00:45:27 and you're getting the straight A's
00:45:29 and doing all the extracurricular stuff
00:45:31 and then you're kind of an overachiever,
00:45:33 for most people high school is autopilot
00:45:35 because the next day will always come
00:45:37 and you'll always know what you have to do.
00:45:39 You always go in,
00:45:41 you're always there for seven hours,
00:45:43 for most people they have a home to come back to.
00:45:45 So the things that matter the most to you
00:45:48 are the things outside of everyday life upkeep.
00:45:51 Whereas as soon as you're out of high school
00:45:53 that's the most important thing
00:45:55 is how the fuck am I going to make enough money
00:45:57 to pay my rent this month
00:45:58 and everything else is secondary.
00:46:00 Getting broken up with a girl,
00:46:02 it sucks but it's not nearly as important
00:46:06 as going to work.
00:46:08 All that is true, I just want to clarify
00:46:10 that my point initially was just that
00:46:12 their opinions on bigger ideas
00:46:15 and when they think that those matter
00:46:17 I think that this ties into it because
00:46:19 they're educated.
00:46:21 Because once you're an adult and you have
00:46:23 this grounded worldview
00:46:25 then that means a little bit.
00:46:27 I think the meme that needs to die is anyone
00:46:29 thinking that their opinion matters
00:46:31 or that they should give a shit.
00:46:33 Anyone who hasn't lived
00:46:35 my exact amazing life
00:46:37 is a fucking moron
00:46:39 and should go away.
00:46:41 If you want to see an example,
00:46:43 just go watch Manshild Marsh.
00:46:45 If you're not actually me
00:46:47 then you have no real experience
00:46:49 with anything.
00:46:51 Oh.
00:46:53 Oh.
00:46:55 I'm sorry.
00:46:57 I love giving disappointment.
00:46:59 Oh, oh no.
00:47:01 Hi Hippo, you got another meme.
00:47:03 I'm not Jesse.
00:47:05 Hey everybody, I'm interrupting the podcast again
00:47:07 because I was thinking about what I said
00:47:09 that last time I interrupted the podcast
00:47:11 with my little rant about neutrality demonization
00:47:13 and I realized maybe I was a bit too hard
00:47:15 on the DeVoo.
00:47:17 I mean, we're all friends here,
00:47:19 there's no reason for me to speak so harshly
00:47:21 and so I decided to bring the DeVoo
00:47:23 on here for a special
00:47:25 one-on-one segment
00:47:27 wherein he will
00:47:29 explain more about what he means by neutrality
00:47:31 worship.
00:47:33 Of course it was nobody's fault that the recording stopped
00:47:35 and the world did not get
00:47:37 to hear our exciting debate the first time
00:47:39 but no matter because I feel it's better
00:47:41 to present these kinds of nuanced issues
00:47:43 one at a time anyways.
00:47:45 It's a much better forum than
00:47:47 having five or six of us all yelling over each other
00:47:49 at once so hello DeVoo
00:47:51 and welcome to the
00:47:53 special interrupting the podcast
00:47:55 podcast.
00:47:57 Hello.
00:47:59 I am the DeVoo.
00:48:01 Let me tell you
00:48:03 about roller coasters
00:48:05 and
00:48:07 Ted Cruz.
00:48:09 I actually heard that Ted Cruz
00:48:11 dropped out of the presidential race
00:48:13 recently.
00:48:15 What are your thoughts on that?
00:48:17 Yes.
00:48:19 Ted Cruz was weak.
00:48:21 He was
00:48:23 incompetent.
00:48:25 A dullard.
00:48:27 He could not have won the election
00:48:29 on his own.
00:48:31 And so I devoured him
00:48:35 to gain his powers
00:48:37 and now
00:48:39 we
00:48:41 are Ted Cruz.
00:48:43 We
00:48:45 are Venom.
00:48:47 Interesting choice of words there
00:48:49 referring to yourself as Venom. Are you saying
00:48:51 that you are an alien symbiote?
00:48:53 Yes.
00:48:55 I am
00:48:57 black
00:48:59 goo
00:49:01 black
00:49:03 sentient goo
00:49:05 with teeth.
00:49:07 DeVoo
00:49:09 is goo
00:49:13 goo draw.
00:49:15 Well that's all the time we have
00:49:17 for in today's edition of the
00:49:19 interrupting the podcast podcast.
00:49:21 Thank you to my guest DeVoo
00:49:23 for taking the time out of his day to be here
00:49:25 but wait I did not get to
00:49:27 talk about neutrality
00:49:29 warship.
00:49:31 That's okay DeVoo neutrality warship was
00:49:33 a stupid thing to bring in in the first place.
00:49:35 It's not a real thing it doesn't make sense
00:49:37 nobody actually worships neutrality
00:49:39 you're complete retard
00:49:41 and the mean that I brought in
00:49:43 neutrality demonization
00:49:45 is actually a
00:49:47 much bigger issue facing society today.
00:49:51 As opposed to neutrality warship
00:49:53 which is not an issue at all
00:49:55 and does not actually even exist.
00:49:57 Yes
00:49:59 when you put it that way
00:50:01 I can see the wisdom in your
00:50:03 words
00:50:05 how could I have been so blind
00:50:07 I return now
00:50:09 to the stars
00:50:15 goodbye
00:50:17 okay that's how I would feel too
00:50:19 alright let's move on
00:50:21 I want one
00:50:23 alright
00:50:25 so
00:50:27 the word cringe worthy
00:50:29 oh yes that was on mine
00:50:31 fucking burns
00:50:33 in the depths of hell
00:50:35 the word cringe in general
00:50:37 is just not good
00:50:39 I have to fucking
00:50:41 this guy's being happy let's get on him
00:50:43 okay cringe
00:50:45 is like
00:50:47 an empathetic thing
00:50:49 if you see someone
00:50:51 doing something awkward
00:50:53 who has no self awareness about it
00:50:55 you feel
00:50:57 embarrassment for that person
00:50:59 that's what people mean when they say cringe
00:51:01 but the key word there is no self awareness
00:51:03 if somebody is doing an act
00:51:05 or doing something and knows what they're fucking doing
00:51:07 it's not fucking cringe
00:51:09 you idiots stop
00:51:11 you nailed it
00:51:13 if you fucking
00:51:15 if you go on
00:51:17 I enjoy cringe worthy stuff
00:51:19 but only when it's actually cringy
00:51:21 it's just like
00:51:23 it's so annoying
00:51:25 cringe now
00:51:27 here's an example
00:51:29 there used to be a famous comedian
00:51:31 called Gallagher
00:51:33 and Gallagher was this dorky looking bald guy
00:51:35 with a mustache and bright suspenders
00:51:37 and he came out on stage and he would smash fruit
00:51:39 with a giant hammer
00:51:41 and people would go to his shows
00:51:43 and they'd wear big plastic sheets
00:51:45 if they were in the splash zone
00:51:47 and everyone loved Gallagher
00:51:49 if Gallagher was just starting out today
00:51:51 he would be on our cringe
00:51:53 look at this goofy idiot in suspenders
00:51:55 smashing fruit isn't he an idiot
00:51:57 no motherfuckers it's his act
00:51:59 he knows what the fuck he's doing
00:52:01 he knows it's silly, he knows it's ridiculous
00:52:03 yeah that's actually the number one mean it needs to die
00:52:05 it's lack of empathy
00:52:07 and lack of understanding other people
00:52:09 or attempting to understand other people
00:52:11 yeah I see a lot of these
00:52:13 like cringe compilations
00:52:15 because my friends will get together
00:52:17 everyone gets bored and we just watch like
00:52:19 fail videos and cringe compilations
00:52:21 and there's always like
00:52:23 some stuff in there
00:52:25 like you said what makes it cringe
00:52:27 is that you feel bad for them
00:52:29 at least for me
00:52:31 I'm like oh man this guy has no idea
00:52:33 what a fucking idiot he's being
00:52:35 but then there's ones in there always
00:52:37 that are like just really fun videos
00:52:39 it's just people having a good time
00:52:41 it's just people dressing up
00:52:43 in funny costumes and doing something fun
00:52:45 and wanting to share it with other people
00:52:47 and sometimes I'm like
00:52:49 this guy clearly knew
00:52:51 this was a goofy thing to do
00:52:53 there's this one video
00:52:55 this guy paint
00:52:57 it's like a sonic video
00:52:59 and this guy is painted blue
00:53:01 like sonic
00:53:03 and he's like running through this insane looking backdrop
00:53:05 and it clearly is supposed to be funny
00:53:07 and like
00:53:09 it's hilarious
00:53:11 it's not cringy at all
00:53:13 it's a joke, it's a fully formulated joke
00:53:15 about running around as sonic
00:53:17 with a couple of this compilation
00:53:19 with like 12 year old screaming
00:53:21 leave sonic alone
00:53:23 like that's cringe
00:53:25 the biggest meaning to die is
00:53:27 there's a lack of empathy for other people
00:53:29 and lack of thinking about what someone really does
00:53:31 and thinks and is
00:53:33 and just making passive judgments without knowing
00:53:35 so you hate autistic people
00:53:37 is that what you're saying
00:53:39 they all need to die huh
00:53:41 should we reopen the first one
00:53:43 that actually brings up a point
00:53:45 it brings up another point
00:53:47 autistic is another buzz word
00:53:49 that needs to fucking die
00:53:51 because people have ruined it
00:53:53 autism
00:53:55 describes like a specific set of behaviors
00:53:57 and people use it just like cringe
00:53:59 oh this is autistic
00:54:01 if they just mean that they didn't like something
00:54:03 no motherfucker you sound like a stupid jackass
00:54:05 go on Wikipedia for 5 minutes
00:54:07 look up the actual symptoms and behaviors
00:54:09 that define autism
00:54:11 and use the fucking word directly
00:54:13 you could use that for like
00:54:15 that complaint with like so many things
00:54:17 like retarded
00:54:19 people using
00:54:21 buzz words and using words incorrectly
00:54:23 is a mean that needs to die
00:54:25 it drives me crazy
00:54:27 it makes me mad and I don't like it
00:54:29 but jesse language is an objective
00:54:31 it means whatever we want it to mean
00:54:33 I got something
00:54:35 it means that needs to die based on what you're saying
00:54:37 ok you need to shut the fuck up for just one fucking second
00:54:39 alright
00:54:41 listen buddy
00:54:43 why does this 15 year old
00:54:45 think that his opinion matters
00:54:47 listen buddy
00:54:49 he's got an old soul
00:54:51 listen buddy
00:54:53 that video I sent you
00:54:55 Nate earlier
00:54:57 oh yeah
00:54:59 listen buddy
00:55:01 listen buddy
00:55:03 listen buddy
00:55:05 listen buddy
00:55:07 listen buddy
00:55:09 listen buddy
00:55:11 is a Chinese language
00:55:13 a Chinese language
00:55:15 a Chinese language
00:55:17 I got something
00:55:19 tell me do you
00:55:21 know what this is
00:55:23 like in your mind
00:55:25 this is the one
00:55:27 this is the one
00:55:29 this is the one
00:55:31 this is the one
00:55:33 this is the one
00:55:35 this is the one
00:55:37 this is
00:55:39 this is the one
00:55:47 listen
00:55:49 there we get a knife
00:55:51 we have
00:55:53 a true blue American give and take
00:55:55 this is the one
00:55:57 this is the one
00:55:59 this is the one
00:56:03 this is the one
00:56:05 Utilizer
00:56:26 This podcast is SPARED!
00:56:35 Yeah, so going to my name, which is a super set of this.
00:56:39 Wait, I was going to go next before you.
00:56:42 Who didn't finish it?
00:56:44 When you're on the internet and people...
00:56:46 This whole fucking podcast is a meme that needs to die.
00:56:49 And they'll post a thing like,
00:56:51 oh, look at this thing happening over here in this place.
00:56:53 Look at those people. They are such and such adjective.
00:56:56 And people are like, yeah, this, yeah, this.
00:56:58 Like being in the video game community on the internet.
00:57:01 They'll post some link and be like, hey, look at this.
00:57:03 Those people are, you know, I come on,
00:57:05 I get on to the internet like in 2007, 2008, and 2009.
00:57:07 People are like, oh, look at that. That thing is racist.
00:57:09 That thing is sexist. That thing is racist.
00:57:11 I'm like, that's not racist. That's not sexist.
00:57:13 You guys are seeing it out of context.
00:57:15 Then 2012 rolls around,
00:57:17 and a bunch of feminists go,
00:57:19 oh, you gamers are racist and sexist.
00:57:21 And they're all like, you're presenting us wrong.
00:57:23 And I'm like, ah, you deserve it.
00:57:25 You idiots.
00:57:27 That's how I felt about the whole situation.
00:57:29 Gamers are doing things to die.
00:57:31 Hey, that's, that's misogynistic.
00:57:33 That is pretty annoying.
00:57:35 The whole standard label.
00:57:37 I won't stand to have my female brothers and sisters slandered.
00:57:41 I wanted to say, I think it's funny,
00:57:45 that like up until Jesse joined this call,
00:57:48 we were like, this was like a really, really peaceful
00:57:51 memes that need to die.
00:57:53 And then Jesse came in and he got really contentious.
00:57:55 But then Jesse's also the one who's most annoyed by it.
00:57:58 And like, it's like, I need to go back to bed.
00:58:00 I just think that's hilarious.
00:58:02 But um...
00:58:04 But anyway...
00:58:06 The problem is you, Jesse.
00:58:08 No!
00:58:10 You isolated the X factor.
00:58:12 To extend on what Jesse was saying
00:58:14 about words being used wrong and stuff,
00:58:16 some memes that I think need to die
00:58:18 are, um,
00:58:20 pretentious.
00:58:22 Oh, yeah.
00:58:24 Forced drama.
00:58:26 This is a new one. Have you guys heard this?
00:58:28 Forced drama?
00:58:30 I've heard it.
00:58:32 It's a meme that's gotten big on 4chan.
00:58:34 Oh, so you know it's intelligent.
00:58:36 Basically, any time there's any drama,
00:58:38 it is now forced drama.
00:58:40 Because there's no such thing...
00:58:42 Because I didn't like it.
00:58:44 Right, there's no such thing anymore of just like,
00:58:46 you know, like,
00:58:48 characters might get upset about something.
00:58:50 No, it's all forced drama now.
00:58:52 Well, the artist did choose to
00:58:54 have them react the way normal humans would,
00:58:56 and that was an artistic choice they made,
00:58:58 so obviously they're forcing that upon the situation.
00:59:00 There's no way
00:59:02 to justify this word,
00:59:04 because you're writing a story.
00:59:06 Everything is forced.
00:59:08 You're writing it. You're making it happen.
00:59:10 So, like,
00:59:12 where is the line where drama
00:59:14 becomes forced drama?
00:59:16 It's totally arbitrary.
00:59:18 Are you talking about fiction? I thought you were talking about YouTube drama.
00:59:20 No, I'm talking about fiction.
00:59:22 Yeah, that's also a meme that needs to die.
00:59:24 Yeah, YouTube drama is a meme that needs to die.
00:59:26 And the fact that so many people are, like,
00:59:28 getting big off of the back of that guy,
00:59:30 it pisses me off, but whatever.
00:59:32 My meme that needs to die
00:59:34 is people blaming me for the contentiousness
00:59:36 of this podcast.
00:59:38 If you go back and listen to it,
00:59:40 you'll see that as soon as I joined the call,
00:59:42 DeVu started talking about politics.
00:59:44 That's what fucking did it. Not me.
00:59:46 It wasn't a political thing, by the way.
00:59:48 It was a societal thing about...
00:59:50 It was a completely non-partisan thing
00:59:52 about how people interpret politics.
00:59:54 Go ahead.
00:59:56 Lay it all on me.
00:59:58 Blame me for all your fucking trouble.
01:00:00 Blame me for your people's inability to communicate properly.
01:00:02 I just think it's really funny,
01:00:04 because right up until, like,
01:00:06 our first memes were, like,
01:00:08 Pizza Hut not tasting good.
01:00:10 I'll be your fucking martyr.
01:00:12 Everyone fucking put me up on the cross
01:00:14 for ruining the...
01:00:16 You know, you're just like that guy the other day.
01:00:18 The podcast was worse because you made it contentious.
01:00:20 You know what?
01:00:22 I just thought it was funny because you said...
01:00:24 I wanted to give a shout out to that guy
01:00:26 who said that I should be kicked off the podcast.
01:00:28 You know, it's funny.
01:00:30 I was actually considering quitting the podcast
01:00:32 and retiring from it entirely,
01:00:34 but now I'm going to stay on forever
01:00:36 just to piss that guy off.
01:00:38 That one guy I'll never miss another...
01:00:40 I was in bed and I got up to come
01:00:42 and join this because I thought about that guy
01:00:44 and how much it would ruin his day
01:00:46 and everyone fight and working my satanic magic
01:00:48 and just bringing chaos into this conversation,
01:00:50 just for that motherfucker
01:00:52 and I hope he's listening and I hope he jokes on it.
01:00:54 I love that you brought that guy up
01:00:56 because we were talking about him before you came on
01:00:58 and how he's probably the only person
01:01:00 we've actually banned for the podcast comments.
01:01:02 But anyway, I wasn't saying
01:01:04 that you were making the podcast worse.
01:01:06 I just thought it was funny because you were the one going,
01:01:08 I should go back to bed.
01:01:10 This podcast needs to die.
01:01:12 It was so peaceful up until you showed up.
01:01:14 Not necessarily that it's your fault.
01:01:16 I got a real one.
01:01:18 I got a real meme that needs to die.
01:01:20 People bitching about movies.
01:01:22 It's a cultural fucking cancer.
01:01:24 It's choking America.
01:01:26 It's choking all of modern society.
01:01:28 People are cynical.
01:01:30 You just did that for like two hours, though.
01:01:32 No, no, no, no.
01:01:34 I knew that someone would say that.
01:01:36 But guess what, motherfucker?
01:01:38 If you actually watched my Batman v Superman review,
01:01:40 that was a positive review.
01:01:42 Yes, I approached my audience.
01:01:44 I analyzed that movie from every possible angle.
01:01:46 And that's why it's the best review.
01:01:48 I said all the positive things.
01:01:50 I said all the negatives.
01:01:52 And I recommended that movie.
01:01:54 I recommended it to everyone.
01:01:56 I said, everyone needs to see this movie.
01:01:58 And ultimately, Jesse, you weren't doing all the things
01:02:00 I hate about people bitching about.
01:02:02 All the things I hate about it, you didn't do.
01:02:04 You weren't being like a little twerp about it.
01:02:06 Like, I've always had a problem.
01:02:08 When I was like a teenager, especially,
01:02:10 I was a little bit more...
01:02:12 If anyone got mad at something,
01:02:14 if I just noticed that everyone hated something,
01:02:16 I would be like, you know what, fuck society.
01:02:18 I'm going to try my hardest to like it.
01:02:20 Because people just came in,
01:02:22 took some jabs,
01:02:24 and didn't really elaborate.
01:02:26 It's just, ha, ha, ha.
01:02:28 Wow, I've had a really bad day.
01:02:30 Almost as bad as Transformers 2.
01:02:32 Stuff like that.
01:02:34 Every joke will be...
01:02:36 Well, you know what it's from.
01:02:38 I want to see that review.
01:02:40 Who would do anything around that does that?
01:02:42 It coincides with the rise of
01:02:44 like, humorous criticism
01:02:46 or like the review as like a funny thing.
01:02:48 Yeah, I was going to say.
01:02:50 Because everyone wants to be...
01:02:52 Everyone is so wrapped up in their witty little
01:02:54 sarcastic, sardonic little cynicism
01:02:56 that they end up missing the forest
01:02:58 for the trees.
01:03:00 And it's like Star Wars, The Force Awakens.
01:03:02 It's, you know,
01:03:04 oh, it's too much like the original
01:03:06 Star Wars.
01:03:08 Why is Rey so good in The Force?
01:03:10 When the fact is, here's the real thing
01:03:12 that they're missing.
01:03:14 That fucking Chewie scene when Han dies
01:03:16 and Chewie goes ape shit.
01:03:18 That was the greatest fucking thing ever.
01:03:20 All those fucking scenes with Kylo when he was
01:03:22 like, throwing fits. That was fucking awesome.
01:03:24 Okay, here's a quick meme that needs to die.
01:03:26 The fact that that movie was good.
01:03:28 Just going to...
01:03:30 It was a 10.
01:03:32 It was fine.
01:03:34 It was a fucking fantastic movie.
01:03:36 That's my point.
01:03:38 It was a fucking, you know, it's a miracle
01:03:40 that that movie was as good as it was.
01:03:42 Star Wars was a ruined franchise, Nate.
01:03:44 It was ruined.
01:03:46 Those three prequel movies ruined the entire
01:03:48 fucking franchise forever.
01:03:50 And miraculously...
01:03:52 They made a good movie.
01:03:54 They made a great fucking movie.
01:03:56 They made a perfect Star Wars film.
01:03:58 People can't see the forest for the trees.
01:04:00 Mine only picks. And these meta fucking issues.
01:04:02 Like, why were there no B-wings?
01:04:04 Why was it so much like the old ones?
01:04:06 It has nothing to do with the actual story told in the movie.
01:04:08 No one cares about the B-wings.
01:04:10 You always say that, but I've never heard anyone...
01:04:12 I mean, tons of people complaining about B-wings.
01:04:14 Why the fuck would they complain about
01:04:16 there being no B-wings?
01:04:18 That made sense. It's not a real complaint.
01:04:20 Oh, but...
01:04:22 I feel the same way about Star Wars 7 that I do about it.
01:04:24 That is a real complaint.
01:04:26 It's not a real complaint. You can't just mind control people instantly.
01:04:28 It takes training.
01:04:30 Look, couldn't do shit.
01:04:32 She's had training!
01:04:34 She had a flashback that she clearly showed
01:04:36 that she's had some fucking training.
01:04:38 What, when she was like three before she could do anything?
01:04:40 No, it's retired. No.
01:04:42 It's not true. Who trained her?
01:04:44 Did Luke train her? Did Luke teach her how to mic?
01:04:46 Maybe.
01:04:48 It was pretty fucking...
01:04:50 Alright, please.
01:04:52 Someone else. Munchy. Beams.
01:04:54 My big old butt.
01:04:56 Anyone who fucking complains about
01:04:58 any movie sounds very deep and needs to die.
01:05:00 I can't tell who apart from Munchy sometimes.
01:05:02 Yeah.
01:05:04 Who's got another meme to lay on the table?
01:05:06 Oh, I've got one.
01:05:08 Okay.
01:05:10 People who think that fart is funny are stupid
01:05:12 when poo is literally like way better.
01:05:14 Poop is the fucking funniest thing ever.
01:05:16 Farts aren't funny at all.
01:05:18 Dude, I'm so with you.
01:05:20 They're fucking unclean and they're terrible.
01:05:22 What is a fart?
01:05:24 But just the smell of poo.
01:05:26 You know?
01:05:28 You just remind me of a meme.
01:05:30 I don't know.
01:05:32 I think farts are pretty funny,
01:05:34 but only in person and when there's a victim
01:05:36 and when that victim is not me.
01:05:38 Those are the requirements.
01:05:40 I fart on people all the time
01:05:42 and I find it pretty funny.
01:05:44 They usually don't fart.
01:05:46 I despise poop.
01:05:48 I hate everything involving an asshole.
01:05:50 It's all wrong.
01:05:52 Jesse, we just made like four songs
01:05:54 about assholes.
01:05:56 Yeah, you're a bit...
01:05:58 They were all hilarious and awesome.
01:06:00 That definitely needs to be killed
01:06:02 and raped and molested and embarrassed.
01:06:04 It's being offended by anything ever.
01:06:06 Yeah, what's that?
01:06:08 Especially being offended
01:06:10 by like toilet humor or bad language.
01:06:12 Those are the ones that annoy me the most.
01:06:14 Yeah, I'm pretty offended by that though.
01:06:16 I can't deal with it.
01:06:18 Oh, yeah.
01:06:20 Mostly it's the tone of
01:06:22 this bad language is bad
01:06:24 and you should feel bad
01:06:26 and I'm all superior.
01:06:28 Can we...
01:06:30 Both with Jesse's
01:06:32 movie bitchy thing and with your
01:06:34 offense thing,
01:06:36 I think it's really more sanctimonious
01:06:38 attitudes about those things
01:06:40 that bother me.
01:06:42 Bitching about movies can be fun
01:06:44 and you can present it in a fun way,
01:06:46 but it's when you're like
01:06:48 in a movie as though
01:06:50 you are above that movie,
01:06:52 that's when it's annoying.
01:06:54 When movie Bob writes his fucking
01:06:56 negative reviews where he makes it out
01:06:58 like this movie somehow killed his family
01:07:00 or like it's ruined cinema forever
01:07:02 or like he had...
01:07:04 It was so problematic that he had to
01:07:06 watch it.
01:07:08 His Batman V Superman video, he said,
01:07:10 I was literally twitching.
01:07:12 I was literally spazzing out when watching it.
01:07:14 Dude, is he serious?
01:07:16 Is he in the theater?
01:07:18 Dude, call the fuck down.
01:07:20 Dude, you have actual problems.
01:07:22 Tourettes or something.
01:07:24 If I'm watching a movie knowing that I'm
01:07:26 going to write a review of it
01:07:28 and that that review is going to make me
01:07:30 probably hundreds if not
01:07:32 thousands of dollars, then I'd be sitting there
01:07:34 like, huh, this movie's not very good.
01:07:36 Awesome. That means I get to write
01:07:38 this kind of video and it'll be a fun time.
01:07:40 Let me just picture yourself.
01:07:42 Hang on Deville, picture yourself.
01:07:44 In this movie theater, there's a giant fat man
01:07:46 sitting there watching a movie twitching
01:07:48 spazzing out like little words.
01:07:50 I can't believe it. I'm going to write a review about this.
01:07:52 I hate this movie. Just picture that.
01:07:54 This is a rancid future file of shit.
01:07:56 You know?
01:07:58 The problem is with you, my friend.
01:08:00 It's so obvious that he can actually get offended
01:08:02 by bad language because I can see him
01:08:04 like he thinks he's supposed to be
01:08:06 and I can watch him
01:08:08 decide his level of offense
01:08:10 and it's all about what words are said,
01:08:12 partially they're said, and what speed they come.
01:08:14 Like someone can go, ah, fuck,
01:08:16 shit ass, and you'll see like his
01:08:18 offense start to go up. His
01:08:20 offense towards bad language is like the
01:08:22 stamina bar in a souls game. It's very complicated
01:08:24 in advance, and I can
01:08:26 calculate it like someone goes, sure.
01:08:28 I showed him like a video and he was
01:08:30 like, ah, Jesus, God.
01:08:32 And then I was like, okay, if he says fuck and then
01:08:34 God, one more time he'll stop watching
01:08:36 the video. So I hope he says like shit
01:08:38 and ass instead. That'll be better.
01:08:40 It's so arbitrary and I hate it.
01:08:42 I tried to show them the resist series,
01:08:44 resist bro, because I knew they'd agree
01:08:46 with like most of the points, but
01:08:48 they denied it of themselves because he said
01:08:50 fuck twice and shit once and he
01:08:52 shouted it so that they're not allowed to watch it.
01:08:54 I was so mad about that. I was
01:08:56 so mad, like it was
01:08:58 so stupid, but you know, I can respect
01:09:00 my dad's opinions
01:09:02 towards other things, right, because like he doesn't
01:09:04 want to watch things that are like really disturbing
01:09:06 or like... Oh, DeVoo, you were so right.
01:09:08 You were so right about this point. I'm so
01:09:10 with you. Listen, there's nothing
01:09:12 wrong with not wanting to engage
01:09:14 with something. Right, I don't know if
01:09:16 my dad has the same sort of
01:09:18 same attitude towards other things, but
01:09:20 I remember when Daybreakers came out
01:09:22 and I'm like, oh sweet, let's watch that movie. My dad was like,
01:09:24 I don't want to watch stuff with vampires in it.
01:09:26 I'm like, why? And he's like, they're
01:09:28 disturbing to me. Okay, I'm just asked, does this man
01:09:30 think that vampires are real? Is that the issue?
01:09:32 No, but he just seems like
01:09:34 they bug him and also that movie
01:09:36 buried. I wanted to watch that and he's like, I'm
01:09:38 not going to watch a movie about a guy getting
01:09:40 buried. And my dad had a
01:09:42 really intense upbringing.
01:09:44 He's not like a guy who's been
01:09:46 privileged or anything. I mean, like
01:09:48 Jesse, never you described
01:09:50 like your life in a
01:09:52 drug crack. He's actually a train.
01:09:54 Poverty, bullcrap,
01:09:56 drugs stuff. My dad had that kind
01:09:58 of upbringing, although worse because it was the
01:10:00 60s and there was no internet to distract yourself
01:10:02 from all the misery. So he has earned
01:10:04 being able to
01:10:06 Well, you know, dads are really...
01:10:08 The reason why I brought that up is because I want to
01:10:10 say, like, there are things you can be disturbing.
01:10:12 No, dads are a great thing. If anything, the world
01:10:14 needs more dads. I love dads. I want to make
01:10:16 a quick, quick shout out to all dads.
01:10:18 I love dads. I want to be a dad someday.
01:10:20 I want to give an anti-shout out to all dads.
01:10:22 Dads are cool.
01:10:24 There's nothing cooler than a cool dad.
01:10:26 I love cool dads.
01:10:28 I also have a friend.
01:10:30 Munchie would make a strangely cool dad.
01:10:32 I want to kill all the dads
01:10:34 and I want to keep the dad of all the guys.
01:10:36 I have a friend who gets offended by things easily
01:10:38 but she doesn't have this attitude of her being
01:10:40 right about it. Or, like, you know, it's her
01:10:42 objective truth. Or at least she hides it
01:10:44 really well. She's very, very respectful
01:10:46 about it and I don't mind that. I just mind
01:10:48 the arbitrariness.
01:10:50 And that's my meme.
01:10:56 I agree. Though I kind of
01:10:58 hate people with bad reasons for doing
01:11:00 whatever they do. So I don't think
01:11:02 being offended by swears is a cool thing
01:11:04 at all, but whatever. Let's move on.
01:11:06 Resist, bro. So that reminds me
01:11:08 of a meme that needs to die.
01:11:10 Veganism. And veganism.
01:11:12 Veganism, yeah.
01:11:14 These fucking morons who think that cows
01:11:16 contain the matter.
01:11:18 I know. I know. Who gives a shit when an animal
01:11:20 thinks it's just shooting in the head to devour
01:11:22 its meat? It's delicious meat that was put
01:11:24 on this earth by Jesus and God for us to
01:11:26 consume. So, you know, frankly,
01:11:28 we're just doing what we want to do.
01:11:32 I'm so sorry that I have these
01:11:34 things in my mouth called
01:11:36 canines, these incisors
01:11:38 that I look in the mirror and it tells me
01:11:40 that I was created to eat meat.
01:11:42 You know, I'm so sorry that we take dumb
01:11:44 stupid, brainless,
01:11:46 zombie animal at cows.
01:11:48 Resist, bro.
01:11:50 Stand around and chew cut all day.
01:11:52 The meme at the core
01:11:54 of the issue is the meme that animal
01:11:56 killings matter and they don't.
01:11:58 They absolutely don't. I don't care.
01:12:00 Cows are particularly stupid animals.
01:12:02 They don't do anything. They don't even know
01:12:04 that alive.
01:12:06 We showed the clip of the cow getting its
01:12:08 throat slit and the blood coming out.
01:12:10 I was just like, I didn't even
01:12:12 eat that. I didn't eat that.
01:12:14 I don't know. Maybe it depends
01:12:16 on whether or not you've grown up
01:12:18 around cows sometimes.
01:12:20 I've spent a fair share
01:12:22 of...
01:12:24 I was grossed out by that.
01:12:26 I was grossed out by that, but on the level of...
01:12:28 Can we, by the way,
01:12:30 establish, because
01:12:32 if you were to look for Resist, bro,
01:12:34 you will find nothing.
01:12:36 We're talking about the Resist Capitalism
01:12:38 videos by Anthony Fankano
01:12:40 on his channel, That Is The Plan.
01:12:42 He created this character
01:12:44 Yeah, we created this.
01:12:46 He created this character who was in response to
01:12:48 the Resist Capitalism thing going around
01:12:50 on Twitter and he's just this weird...
01:12:52 until I stopped agreeing with this.
01:12:54 It was really great until he
01:12:56 decided to make his character into
01:12:58 like this...
01:13:00 He did this whole thing commenting on veganism
01:13:02 and basically trying to paint anybody who's not a vegan
01:13:04 as a lazy idiot.
01:13:06 He fucked up.
01:13:08 I can respect the veganism position.
01:13:10 I understand your feelings and I know that Paul McCartney's
01:13:12 line was
01:13:14 if slaughterhouses had glass walls,
01:13:16 everyone would be a vegetarian.
01:13:18 My rebuttal is
01:13:20 everyone had a cow in their backyard.
01:13:22 Everyone would not give a shit anymore.
01:13:24 Everyone would not give a shit anymore.
01:13:26 I listened to Africa for a couple of months
01:13:28 when I was like a kid and
01:13:30 we had a cow in their backyard.
01:13:32 When you spend a lot of time around a cow,
01:13:34 you realize something.
01:13:36 You just want to eat that motherfucker.
01:13:38 They don't leave any more of an impression on you
01:13:40 than a tree.
01:13:42 That's the fact.
01:13:44 I don't know, I think cows are cute.
01:13:46 Gibbs got a descending opinion.
01:13:48 In the 1876 anime series
01:13:50 Nobody's Boy Remy,
01:13:52 the main character's only friend was a cow
01:13:54 and they had to sell it off because they got poor
01:13:56 and it was sad.
01:13:58 Vegans, I know that you won't have this movement.
01:14:00 Not for the person, not for the cow.
01:14:02 Vegans, I know you want to have this movement.
01:14:04 Vegans is just a third elitist and that's really the ultimate
01:14:06 meat that needs to die is fucking elitism.
01:14:08 I know you want to bring society in a direction that you wanted
01:14:10 but it's over now.
01:14:12 Drink your big black cow and get out of here.
01:14:14 Animals are tools
01:14:16 to be used by humans.
01:14:18 They can be cute, they can be funny
01:14:20 but they only matter to us.
01:14:22 The moment we want to kill them we should be able to
01:14:24 because we're the dominant species on the planet.
01:14:26 I agree.
01:14:28 I think we worked all this.
01:14:30 I think that our species worked so hard
01:14:32 to get here.
01:14:34 Not so that we could just go back
01:14:36 on everything we've accomplished
01:14:38 and fucking, and then
01:14:40 assume just because we don't
01:14:42 understand plants that well
01:14:44 does not feel anything
01:14:46 and that killing them is totally okay.
01:14:48 It doesn't fucking matter.
01:14:50 That kind of shoots our whole argument
01:14:52 when you start talking about plants having souls.
01:14:54 You guys are over thinking this.
01:14:56 Vegans are just annoying fucking elitists.
01:14:58 Elitism is a mean that needs to die.
01:15:00 It's the ultimate mean that needs to die.
01:15:02 It's really what it all comes down to.
01:15:04 Anyone who thinks that your stupid little belief
01:15:06 or your stupid little agenda
01:15:08 or what you like
01:15:10 or what someone else likes makes you better
01:15:12 get off my planet.
01:15:14 I'll give you one thing real quick though
01:15:16 and it's just that if we could just have
01:15:18 all the things that we have now
01:15:20 and also let the animals live
01:15:22 then okay sure they can live.
01:15:24 Since we can't I'm totally fine with eating them.
01:15:26 My meme that needs to die is
01:15:28 give us something.
01:15:30 What are you saying?
01:15:32 Okay.
01:15:34 I was just going to say I disagree
01:15:36 with the idea that
01:15:38 farm animals are inherently less interesting
01:15:40 than household pets.
01:15:42 It completely depends on
01:15:44 because they're just animals.
01:15:46 If you live with them they can be cool.
01:15:48 They can play.
01:15:50 Are you claiming that household pets are interesting?
01:15:52 I like my dog.
01:15:54 I like my pet.
01:15:56 Dog haters like Digi that's a mean thing.
01:15:58 I'm just saying.
01:16:00 I hate all animals.
01:16:02 Animals are cool.
01:16:04 I have three dogs
01:16:06 but if I wanted to eat
01:16:08 a dog burger I would totally
01:16:10 fucking break out my hammer
01:16:12 and I would smash that shit
01:16:14 and I would fucking eat it.
01:16:16 I just hate chickens and cows and shit
01:16:18 because they're fucking stupid and they don't do anything.
01:16:20 Chickens and cows are cool as shit.
01:16:22 They're cool as shit and they could be your friends.
01:16:24 Right?
01:16:26 Chickens are my friends.
01:16:28 I would hug a chicken.
01:16:30 I would have a chicken on my shoulder.
01:16:32 I'd be the pirate chicken.
01:16:34 I would never eat a raven or crow.
01:16:36 Because I've never been wrong about anything.
01:16:38 Oh, well done.
01:16:40 Give us another meme.
01:16:42 Munchy, you gotta have more, right?
01:16:44 Yeah.
01:16:46 I have a ton.
01:16:48 The meme that Sonic 2 is bad
01:16:50 and all 2D Sonics are bad.
01:16:52 Sonic 1 is worse.
01:16:54 The first Sonic 2 or the Sonic Adventure 2.
01:16:56 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a 10 out of 10 game.
01:16:58 Hang on.
01:17:00 I thought the consensus with the Sonic 1
01:17:02 was kind of the weakest in the whole series.
01:17:04 Sonic 1 either, but I still think it's a good game.
01:17:06 In the whole series, that's kind of...
01:17:08 I'm not saying any of them are bad.
01:17:10 I'm just saying that I thought people actually like Sonic 2.
01:17:12 I haven't heard this argument that...
01:17:14 I've heard the argument that all the old
01:17:16 Sonics are bad, but I think
01:17:18 where that really comes from.
01:17:20 I don't like any of the Sonic games,
01:17:22 but I don't think Sonic 2 is a bad game.
01:17:24 Play Sonic Advance.
01:17:26 What you'll realize is that
01:17:28 the people who are saying that, they've played all the new games,
01:17:30 which all suck.
01:17:32 I'm going to try out the old ones.
01:17:34 And then they play Sonic 1, and they go,
01:17:36 well, all the old ones are like Sonic 1,
01:17:38 and Sonic 1's not fun, so fuck old Sonic.
01:17:40 When really, Sonic 2 is
01:17:42 way better than Sonic 1.
01:17:44 So I think that there's...
01:17:46 I think that people who say all the old Sonic suck
01:17:48 have probably only played Sonic 1
01:17:50 and don't realize that 2 and 3
01:17:52 are much improved.
01:17:54 Not to say that I think they're great...
01:17:56 Okay, I'm not going to say they're not great games.
01:17:58 I just don't like them.
01:18:00 When I played Sonic 2 on the Blue Glow,
01:18:02 I was like, I appreciate what's good,
01:18:04 why this game is fun.
01:18:06 Sonic 1 is tedious
01:18:08 and has too many levels,
01:18:10 but Sonic 2 is like, yeah,
01:18:12 this looks like it's a tight, fun experience.
01:18:14 If you'd played it enough as a kid
01:18:16 to know how to play it,
01:18:18 then it would be extremely satisfying.
01:18:20 It's got great music and great visuals.
01:18:22 It's a solid game.
01:18:24 I'm going to go watch my video.
01:18:26 We've got to talk about wisdom teeth.
01:18:28 They're a meme that needs to die.
01:18:30 I'm sick and tired of these fucking things.
01:18:32 You should get them out too.
01:18:34 No, because my second meme was dentist.
01:18:36 I can't get them out because I don't want to
01:18:38 look at one of those motherfuckers
01:18:40 who want to go in your mouth.
01:18:42 They're expensive too.
01:18:44 I have 30 fillings in my mouth,
01:18:46 so the dentist
01:18:48 is like a second home to me.
01:18:50 I actually have 3 wisdom teeth
01:18:52 grown in, but they haven't bothered me enough
01:18:54 to want to take them out.
01:18:56 That's fine.
01:18:58 The meme that needs to die
01:19:00 is the idea that
01:19:02 English people have bad teeth and Americans don't.
01:19:04 No, that one's true.
01:19:06 I'm going to confirm that one right now.
01:19:08 I'm already cracking it.
01:19:10 They don't have the best...
01:19:12 Let's hear Gibb out on this one.
01:19:14 Go ahead. Convince us.
01:19:16 I don't know how to convince you.
01:19:18 I can just say fuck you.
01:19:20 It's not true.
01:19:22 I will say that when I...
01:19:24 I don't think it's that Americans have
01:19:26 better teeth. I think it's that we
01:19:28 put better teeth on television.
01:19:30 I actually want to disagree because
01:19:32 when I was in Japan, I distinctly noticed
01:19:34 a ton of fucked up teeth.
01:19:36 You can see that on Japanese TV.
01:19:38 I feel most at home.
01:19:40 Because the Japanese are just genetically inferior.
01:19:42 Let's be honest.
01:19:44 I think we need to take out the Japanese braces.
01:19:46 I need to speak as a man.
01:19:48 Speaking as a man with awful teeth.
01:19:50 We can treat the Japanese like cows and chickens.
01:19:52 You've all seen my teeth.
01:19:54 You all know that I've got the most...
01:19:56 God damn it!
01:19:58 Let me finish my fucking sentence.
01:20:00 Everyone knows I got the most...
01:20:06 When I watch
01:20:08 British and Japanese shows,
01:20:10 I feel much more comfortable
01:20:12 and less self-conscious about myself
01:20:14 because I realize that the stigma...
01:20:16 Because people make fun of my teeth
01:20:18 offline all the time.
01:20:20 My friends give me shit about it.
01:20:22 My mom's like 50 and she's got braces.
01:20:24 Because her teeth...
01:20:26 Genetically, I got my fucked up teeth
01:20:28 from my mom.
01:20:30 But she's embarrassed about them and wants to fix it.
01:20:32 I'm like, I don't give a fuck.
01:20:34 The fact that they're in disarray
01:20:36 doesn't really change anything.
01:20:38 It doesn't really matter.
01:20:40 It's just a weird aesthetic thing that people are obsessed with.
01:20:42 And only really in the US.
01:20:44 When I watch shows from other countries, they clearly don't care.
01:20:46 They've got pop stars with fucking teeth.
01:20:48 I was watching baby metal videos yesterday
01:20:50 to prepare for
01:20:52 my podcast with the Needle Drop.
01:20:54 The lead singer girl has pretty fucked up teeth.
01:20:56 And I was like,
01:20:58 they're internationally successful band
01:21:00 known for how adorable the girls are
01:21:02 and the girls got fucked up teeth like me.
01:21:04 So, you know,
01:21:06 I am asking for more fucked up teeth representation.
01:21:08 I had a hard time talking.
01:21:10 You can go listen to my videos from 2008
01:21:12 and try not to keep your eyes from watering.
01:21:14 So that raises
01:21:16 that straight into my teeth.
01:21:18 Although the day I got my braces off,
01:21:20 I was like, great, a retainer.
01:21:22 Awesome. I put that on.
01:21:24 How long do I have to have this retainer on?
01:21:26 The rest of your life. The rest of your life.
01:21:28 You put it on when you go to sleep permanently.
01:21:30 Every night. I'm like, uh, no.
01:21:32 I'm still doing that, dude. I'm still doing that.
01:21:34 As soon as I found out about that, I was like,
01:21:36 I would never get pregnant.
01:21:38 After your whole orthodontist shit's done,
01:21:40 you're given a retainer and said
01:21:42 use this for the rest of your life.
01:21:44 That's awful.
01:21:46 When I heard that, I would flip my shit.
01:21:48 With you, Jesse, this whole thing needs to go.
01:21:50 This whole thing needs to go.
01:21:52 So, like, only a week ago,
01:21:54 I'm like, alright, I'm not putting this thing on anymore.
01:21:56 I would rather have a good life and slightly messed up teeth.
01:21:58 Hopefully they won't.
01:22:00 Teeth shaming is a meme that needs to die.
01:22:02 Big problem. Go vote it up.
01:22:04 You know what?
01:22:06 Star Wars is a meme that needs to die.
01:22:08 I fucking...
01:22:10 That's what you like to...
01:22:12 No, no.
01:22:14 Okay, I guess I have a complicated stance
01:22:16 on this issue.
01:22:18 The Force Awakens
01:22:20 is by far the best Star Wars movie.
01:22:22 But I fucking hate Star Wars,
01:22:24 and it needs to go away forever.
01:22:26 I agree there.
01:22:28 I don't like what Star Wars does to people.
01:22:30 I don't like what it does to my country.
01:22:32 I don't like the obsession that everyone
01:22:34 in the fucking world has with Star Wars.
01:22:36 Star Wars isn't that special.
01:22:38 Whenever anyone is a super fan of Star Wars,
01:22:40 and I just think about how these people
01:22:42 could have been watching Star Trek this whole time
01:22:44 they've been wasting their lives.
01:22:46 Now that this is pretty much just turned
01:22:48 into the biggest problem in the universe,
01:22:50 I'm going to say franchise worship
01:22:52 is a meme that needs to die.
01:22:54 I think it's really cool.
01:22:56 That one is a serious problem that causes people to be stupid.
01:22:58 Yeah, I think that it's really cool
01:23:00 when we have a continuing story
01:23:02 or a continuing narrative that can go on for like...
01:23:04 Star Trek is a great franchise
01:23:06 because it makes sense
01:23:08 why they keep doing more.
01:23:10 They're always like a sequel to the last one,
01:23:12 except for those new movies
01:23:14 which just tried to reboot the original characters,
01:23:16 which doesn't make any sense
01:23:18 because Star Trek should just be always new people.
01:23:20 It should always be updated
01:23:22 to match the current technology.
01:23:24 So the Star Trek TV shows have always made sense.
01:23:26 Even if there's one that's not good,
01:23:28 it doesn't really affect the overall nature
01:23:30 of the franchise because that's the kind of show it is.
01:23:32 It's something that should come back every 10 years.
01:23:34 Right, and like in Star Wars,
01:23:36 that's what makes the next generation worse.
01:23:38 Right, and Star Wars reflected
01:23:40 where our culture was back in the 70s
01:23:42 in regards to storytelling
01:23:44 and it reflected upon the hero's journey.
01:23:46 More than that, it's been a progressive version
01:23:48 of that day in time.
01:23:50 Just having that black chick on Star Trek
01:23:52 back in the day was like...
01:23:54 Everyone was like, oh damn, Martin Luther King
01:23:56 called her up at one point and was like,
01:23:58 hey, just want to let you know, you're making us proud.
01:24:00 You're just being a black face on TV
01:24:02 and that's just helping our cause.
01:24:04 It evolved that way because like I said,
01:24:06 it reflected the hero's journey stuff
01:24:08 and it reflected the way that the world
01:24:10 saw warfare and evil empires after World War II
01:24:12 and all that stuff.
01:24:14 That's why I ultimately didn't like
01:24:16 Episode 7 that much because it was
01:24:18 still the same stuff.
01:24:20 I feel like the logical evolution would be
01:24:22 to tell a story that's all about
01:24:24 the way that storytelling is today
01:24:26 and reflected stuff like...
01:24:28 Star Wars has never been an intellectual series
01:24:30 from the beginning.
01:24:32 To be intellectualism, I just think that
01:24:34 Star Wars was fine being what it was
01:24:36 and it didn't need to be...
01:24:38 If you want to make another movie like Star Wars...
01:24:40 Just make a new sci-fi franchise.
01:24:42 To this day, you'll still see
01:24:44 New Star Wars merchandise and the commercial
01:24:46 on TV will show up and you'll get the music.
01:24:48 I'm like, dude, this was like
01:24:50 three movies and then three shitty movies
01:24:52 and I guess we're going to have more, but
01:24:54 why are we still on about this one franchise?
01:24:56 There's other ones that have better character designs,
01:24:58 better ship designs, more interesting stuff going on.
01:25:00 I don't want any of it repeated.
01:25:04 Right now we've got all the
01:25:06 superhero movies coming out and everything
01:25:08 and I think it's cool
01:25:10 for a little bit, but then when we get these
01:25:12 we've got to this point
01:25:14 where stuff will succeed
01:25:16 just because it's in a franchise and that
01:25:18 makes it so all anyone cares about
01:25:20 is franchises anymore.
01:25:22 What I was going to say is
01:25:24 it's not just franchise
01:25:26 worship, but franchise enabling
01:25:28 with people who don't like the franchise
01:25:30 but they will still buy it like Final Fantasy.
01:25:32 People like you, Jesse and Nate
01:25:34 you're going to buy Final Fantasy 15.
01:25:36 I'm only going to buy it to show the world
01:25:38 how fucked up it is.
01:25:40 And you're going to hate it.
01:25:42 That brings me to an even better point.
01:25:44 Just generally enabling
01:25:46 there's so many fucking
01:25:48 reviews out there that are like
01:25:50 why do people keep buying
01:25:52 these games from the perspective of
01:25:54 someone who bought the game
01:25:56 so they could review it.
01:25:58 You're a part of the problem.
01:26:00 Or exempt from this because they do it
01:26:02 they actually make something out of it.
01:26:04 But that's the thing, everyone's doing it now.
01:26:06 Not to buy the game, they're making a difference.
01:26:08 You can fucking, you can make a game
01:26:10 and you can like
01:26:12 probably make like back
01:26:14 like if it's a relatively cheap game you can probably
01:26:16 make back your money just on the number of reviewers
01:26:18 buying the thing so they can bitch about it.
01:26:20 That's not true. No it is true.
01:26:22 Because think about it, there's hundreds of
01:26:24 YouTube reviewers and I'm not just talking about big people
01:26:26 I'm talking about everyone on Twitter
01:26:28 who wants to fucking buy a game
01:26:30 so they can tell everybody else not to buy the game
01:26:32 even though their opinion doesn't matter and nobody listens to them.
01:26:34 You only, like, if you think
01:26:36 something looks, like, if you're mad
01:26:38 at the bad business decisions that a company
01:26:40 is making then tell people
01:26:42 I'm not buying this game and you shouldn't either
01:26:44 because I'm upset by their business decision.
01:26:46 That's why I parroted everything. I'm not a part of the problem.
01:26:48 I parroted millions of lives. I don't think that would happen.
01:26:50 Well Digi you have warped and perverted
01:26:52 to the point about Star Wars.
01:26:54 No this is a different thing.
01:26:56 This is nothing to do with Star Wars.
01:26:58 Because Hippo changed it and I
01:27:00 wanted to leap off of that into a different
01:27:02 meme which is people
01:27:04 enabling bad business decisions
01:27:06 for the sake
01:27:08 of, like, criticizing them
01:27:10 by way of supporting them
01:27:12 which doesn't make any sense.
01:27:14 I don't know how much that would make.
01:27:16 I might make like $2,000, $3,000
01:27:18 from that sort of stuff.
01:27:20 I agree there's some
01:27:22 Digi must be talking about
01:27:24 the larger environment we're in now
01:27:26 where people want to talk about the new topical thing
01:27:28 because they know there's going to be a desire for it.
01:27:30 Digi that whole scenario you said
01:27:32 about how the reviewers are the ones
01:27:34 enabling it because just them would be enough
01:27:36 to make sales for something low budget.
01:27:38 Well let's say there's a franchise that needs to die.
01:27:40 Episode, you know,
01:27:42 the first movie comes out in the franchise
01:27:44 everyone sees it and it sucks.
01:27:46 The second one comes out and it sucks harder
01:27:48 like stop watching it.
01:27:50 You're describing Final Fantasy XIII right now.
01:27:52 And then no one
01:27:54 watches the third one except for the reviewers
01:27:56 but apparently the reviewers watching it
01:27:58 allows it to make his money back.
01:28:00 People say don't watch it and then the audience says
01:28:02 oh we didn't and so then the reviewers are like
01:28:04 that doesn't happen though, that will never happen
01:28:06 because when the reviewers see it
01:28:08 they say oh guys
01:28:10 this movie's terrible
01:28:12 you should not see it and then everyone's going to go
01:28:14 oh well now I got to know how my opinion
01:28:16 is going to be a review and then they're going to go see it
01:28:18 because people are reviewing it.
01:28:20 I'm saying that we should
01:28:22 if you think a movie is going to be terrible
01:28:24 and you don't want people to see it
01:28:26 don't add to the hype, don't make it
01:28:28 there's so many things.
01:28:30 I'm wondering if our negative review
01:28:32 is inherently counterproductive
01:28:34 like because you made your asterisk war thing
01:28:36 that probably got more people to watch it
01:28:38 than who already would have.
01:28:40 Is it a destructive force to do something like that?
01:28:42 That's a good point and in fact criticism
01:28:44 is a meme that needs to die.
01:28:46 I hate reviews, I hate reviewers
01:28:48 it serves no functional purpose in the world
01:28:50 we have to separate down
01:28:52 it's only destructive
01:28:54 there's no such thing as constructive criticism
01:28:56 nothing good can ever come from a bunch of cynical idiots
01:28:58 patting themselves in the back
01:29:00 about how cleverly they can dismantle something
01:29:02 and try to shit on someone else's art
01:29:04 all criticism needs to be abolished
01:29:06 it's all a fucking disease
01:29:08 I disagree with that because my asterisk war series
01:29:10 is perfect and
01:29:12 everyone should watch it and give me 100 million dollars
01:29:14 and anyone who
01:29:16 doesn't think it's perfect is objectively wrong
01:29:18 but the point of it
01:29:20 Reviewers and critics can also make videos
01:29:22 like what is the appeal of anime
01:29:24 where it's all about go buy
01:29:26 spend money at all this stuff because it has
01:29:28 really interesting and diverse stories
01:29:30 we're talking about the negative review itself right now
01:29:32 however much
01:29:34 Digi is able to empower the asterisk war
01:29:36 by making his video about it
01:29:38 he also makes videos saying hey everyone
01:29:40 anime is really interesting
01:29:42 so go watch it
01:29:44 the whole point of the asterisk war thing was
01:29:46 to just use that show as an example
01:29:48 that's a meme that needs to die
01:29:50 the point of the asterisk war series
01:29:52 was not about
01:29:54 the asterisk war itself
01:29:56 and while I do in the end say
01:29:58 I wish people wouldn't watch this show
01:30:00 even though I did in fact incentivize
01:30:02 tons of people to watch it
01:30:04 it wasn't so much about this one show
01:30:06 it was about this genre
01:30:08 that I haven't covered any other shows
01:30:10 in that genre since
01:30:12 and I don't intend to because people keep asking me
01:30:14 are you going to talk about asterisk war season 2
01:30:16 and I'm like no because
01:30:18 that defeats the point
01:30:20 here's this type of show don't watch it
01:30:22 the reason that I don't consider
01:30:24 your asterisk review
01:30:26 in line with what I'm talking about
01:30:28 is because you kind of approached it
01:30:30 with a purpose and it was more analytical
01:30:34 a lot of people would make that case
01:30:36 my problem with
01:30:38 with the world and with criticism
01:30:40 popular criticism nowadays
01:30:42 and it goes back to Star Wars
01:30:44 goes back to everything I'm talking about it's all connected baby
01:30:46 my problem is that people nowadays
01:30:48 are more in love
01:30:50 with having the funniest negative review
01:30:52 than they are with actually understanding
01:30:54 the art in front of them
01:30:56 I think we're all really just mad at movie bob
01:30:58 can we all just like is that really what's happening
01:31:00 is that we all just really hate what movie bob
01:31:02 is doing
01:31:04 talking about every fucking smarmy
01:31:06 wise ass on the internet
01:31:08 well I don't watch a lot of those
01:31:10 so like I don't know the guys you're talking about
01:31:12 that's when that started with me as transformers
01:31:14 too because people would go
01:31:16 I didn't think it was a good movie
01:31:18 I just thought it was mildly entertaining whatever
01:31:20 but people were like oh it's so terrible
01:31:22 it sucks so much
01:31:24 no I think it's the worst movie ever
01:31:26 oh man you know oh jeez
01:31:28 this pizza slice was really terrible
01:31:30 it's almost as bad as transformers too
01:31:32 it's so annoyed me because
01:31:34 and even the star wars prequel stuff
01:31:36 before I saw the plinket reviews
01:31:38 I was very annoyed by those people
01:31:40 because they would always just be like oh man
01:31:42 I just got a freaking gallstone
01:31:44 and it hurt like hell
01:31:46 it was almost as bad as jar jar binks
01:31:48 but those movies really aren't that bad
01:31:50 I hated those people so bad
01:31:52 I hated that so much it made me want to like the prequels
01:31:54 because I hated those people about it
01:31:56 because they weren't being constructed
01:31:58 I felt similar
01:32:00 the plinket reviews are analytical
01:32:02 and have something to say
01:32:04 so you're making a decision
01:32:06 so you're making a decision
01:32:08 between substantive critiques
01:32:10 and just shitting on something
01:32:12 although you did say
01:32:14 constructive criticism doesn't exist
01:32:16 like five minutes ago
01:32:18 yeah well that was a lie
01:32:20 no wait wait wait
01:32:22 that doesn't mean it needs to die
01:32:24 everybody shut up I have to go back
01:32:26 it wasn't a lie I was right then
01:32:28 I actually agree
01:32:30 I agree that constructive criticism is the truth
01:32:32 even when he lies
01:32:34 because as I said in a previous podcast
01:32:36 it's only really constructive
01:32:38 if you know what the person intends
01:32:40 so like you know me ragging on Astros for
01:32:42 has nothing to do with whether the author
01:32:44 did what he intended to do
01:32:46 it has to do with me wanting people to stop
01:32:48 gratifying the author
01:32:50 I don't know dude maybe his intention was to make the worst thing of all times
01:32:52 that people would realize that he should be supporting these particular
01:32:54 yeah he succeeded
01:32:56 yeah like a meme that needs to die
01:32:58 is saying that you need to
01:33:00 make your criticism constructive
01:33:02 even if really what they mean
01:33:04 is just don't use exclamation marks
01:33:06 well this is getting too close to our
01:33:08 comment or rules and reviewer rules
01:33:10 so Munchy give us another meme to go
01:33:12 yeah Munchy go
01:33:14 new pokemon aren't cool
01:33:16 the fucking ice cream pokemon is
01:33:18 fucking amazing he's so cool
01:33:20 I'm not joking he's awesome
01:33:22 he's literally very cool
01:33:24 one of them is a ring of keys
01:33:26 he's the ring of keys dude
01:33:28 I know it's awesome
01:33:30 yeah but have you played Kingdom Hearts
01:33:32 Kingdom Hearts has keys in it
01:33:34 Kingdom Hearts uh no it doesn't
01:33:36 who's the keys in Kingdom Hearts there's no keys
01:33:38 the key blade you fucking idiot
01:33:40 it's not a ring of keys it's one key
01:33:42 I know that big pokemon are inherently cool
01:33:44 cause you put them in the lock and you go
01:33:46 yeah but this guy you just give him your keys
01:33:48 those keys don't come with him you use him
01:33:50 as your key holding device
01:33:52 he is a pokemon that is
01:33:54 literally a key blade monster
01:33:56 enough about the damn keys
01:33:58 so about these pokemon
01:34:00 a lot of people rag on
01:34:02 like uh
01:34:04 a garbodor and the uh
01:34:06 what's the one that calls into garbodor
01:34:08 it's fucking garbage
01:34:10 I appreciate that complaint
01:34:12 and garbodor
01:34:14 and jesse's video is fucking hilarious
01:34:16 with that part cause it's literal garbage
01:34:18 but if you
01:34:20 I'm feeling
01:34:22 god damn it
01:34:24 I had this song in my head all day the other day because of you
01:34:26 you son of a bitch
01:34:28 let me finish my point
01:34:30 you might break my heart
01:34:32 oh why'd you do anything so easy
01:34:34 ever be so hard to do
01:34:38 I wanna tell you
01:34:40 how I'm feeling and to say
01:34:44 I love you
01:34:46 yeah look
01:34:48 continue my point
01:34:50 do not try to co-op the fact that chaos happened
01:34:52 to interrupt the point I was barely into
01:34:54 god damn it
01:34:56 so back in generation one
01:34:58 there was this pokemon called
01:35:00 grimer that evolved into muck
01:35:02 and if you read the description of grimer
01:35:04 which is literally just a purple puddle
01:35:06 the darkness of warnings the future doesn't
01:35:08 scare me at all
01:35:10 nothing's like before
01:35:12 nothing's like before
01:35:14 if you read the description
01:35:16 for grimer and muck they are literally
01:35:18 sewage
01:35:20 it actually says
01:35:22 literally sewage in the description of muck
01:35:24 muck is well known to be made out of cum
01:35:26 so the idea
01:35:28 of a pokemon that are just a blob of garbage
01:35:30 has always been a thing
01:35:32 and generation one had
01:35:34 volt orb that evolved into
01:35:36 electrum
01:35:38 muck is like
01:35:42 garbador is just this fucking
01:35:44 snaggletooth gay fag
01:35:46 I agree that garbador looks like shit
01:35:48 eggs? that one is pretty stupid isn't it
01:35:50 execute rules
01:35:52 execute rules are awesome
01:35:54 execute tour
01:35:56 I just think that
01:35:58 I don't think that garbador is
01:36:00 conceptually bad
01:36:02 the meme that
01:36:04 executor is not the best pokemon
01:36:06 is it's gotta die
01:36:08 I think
01:36:10 stop! tofu I'm not done
01:36:12 taking this point
01:36:14 why do you keep trying to come up to the chaos
01:36:16 to cut me off goddammit
01:36:18 anyways
01:36:20 the latest generation of pokemon
01:36:22 when x and y came out
01:36:24 I looked at all the pokemon from all the generations
01:36:26 and I tried to give them all
01:36:28 ratings
01:36:30 and I actually thought x and y had
01:36:32 by density
01:36:34 the coolest pokemon
01:36:36 there's a ton of really awesome ones
01:36:38 how lucha
01:36:40 dore bird it looks amazing
01:36:42 you've got
01:36:44 the whole sligeun slugdra family
01:36:46 that was one of my favorites
01:36:48 fucking
01:36:50 gujra
01:36:52 gujra should be an all female
01:36:54 should be an all female
01:36:56 gujra turns me on
01:36:58 gujra is like my main for that game
01:37:00 there's
01:37:02 the fucking one that's like a ghost sword
01:37:04 that one's pretty cool
01:37:06 I like ghost slag
01:37:08 there's a ton of awesome pokemon
01:37:10 and I'll say that
01:37:12 there are some shitty ones in there
01:37:14 that one that's like a barnacle
01:37:16 attached to a rock that one looks fucking terrible
01:37:18 that one sucks, that one's horrible
01:37:20 somebody just said that gujra turns you on
01:37:22 so I looked up
01:37:24 gujra to see what it looks like
01:37:26 and what the fuck is wrong with you
01:37:28 it's a goo monster
01:37:30 it's adorable
01:37:32 this thing is a filthy
01:37:34 fucking
01:37:36 it's an abomination
01:37:38 it's a big pink goo
01:37:40 that's what it is
01:37:42 it looks like it's got a mucusy chin
01:37:44 it's covered in jizz
01:37:46 it's covered in jizz, it's gross
01:37:48 aren't you not into like slime girls
01:37:50 and stuff
01:37:52 I mean I like slime girls but this dude's just covered in jizz
01:37:54 I don't want to touch that guy
01:37:56 he's pink and goo, I like it
01:37:58 he's pink and goo
01:38:00 I like it
01:38:02 let's say no slime girls
01:38:04 are you telling your thingamajig?
01:38:06 yes I'm done with my story
01:38:08 I actually had a very similar thingamajig
01:38:10 but a friend of mine
01:38:12 had gotten to pokemon a number of years ago
01:38:14 and she wanted to do a pokemon mystery dungeon
01:38:16 story with me
01:38:18 where we would each write our characters
01:38:20 sort of like a roleplay but not in order
01:38:22 and so we'd do a run of mystery dungeon
01:38:24 or we'd just tell a story
01:38:26 we'd just write a story
01:38:28 we never did it but we spent weeks preparing it
01:38:30 so in that time I had to decide what pokemon I was going to be
01:38:32 I thought that the entire list
01:38:34 and I concluded that by density
01:38:36 X and Y had the most consistently good designs
01:38:38 I had the exact same conclusion
01:38:40 and then when Digi came out with his pokemon X and Y videos
01:38:42 and said that this generation has the most
01:38:44 consistently excellent designs
01:38:46 I was like yeah, that one had the least amount
01:38:48 of unique pokemon
01:38:50 quality over quantity
01:38:52 I ultimately decided to be litwick
01:38:54 I believe that's a gen X and Y roleplay
01:38:56 well I like gen 3 because it's
01:38:58 if I had to be a pokemon
01:39:00 I'd be a litwick, that'd be pretty awesome
01:39:02 Shandalura is my favorite pokemon ever
01:39:04 yeah that's right but munchie was right
01:39:06 that wasn't X and Y, that was before
01:39:08 I think me and munchie can both agree
01:39:10 that munchlax is possibly
01:39:12 the greatest pokemon ever
01:39:14 not possibly, are you joking?
01:39:16 gen 3 or 4 right?
01:39:18 gen 3 I think
01:39:20 gen 4 is the best pokemon generation
01:39:22 if you think so you're literally fucking retarded
01:39:24 I think this whole thing about pokemon
01:39:26 designs happened with
01:39:28 all the best evolutions for the prior pokemon
01:39:30 all the best items, all the hottest
01:39:32 pokemon girls
01:39:34 munchlax, alright sucks
01:39:36 I believe the whole meme about pokemon generations
01:39:38 thinking that pokemon, the new generations
01:39:40 are good just because he wasn't
01:39:42 with it in the real old days
01:39:44 he doesn't understand the real pokemon
01:39:46 he doesn't know
01:39:48 I wasn't there in the real old days
01:39:50 Misty isn't even cool dude
01:39:52 Misty isn't good
01:39:54 wait what are you saying
01:39:56 I don't know
01:39:58 I don't know
01:40:00 I didn't hear
01:40:02 I didn't hear what he said
01:40:04 should I be out of breath
01:40:06 he said misty is not cool
01:40:08 oh well
01:40:10 alright new meme
01:40:12 that's somebody new meme
01:40:14 munchie go, next one
01:40:16 4chan
01:40:18 everyone who goes on 4chan, I want to fucking strangle
01:40:20 it's not cool
01:40:22 get the fuck out of here
01:40:24 he's got it figured out
01:40:26 you guys are a bunch of babies
01:40:28 you guys are a bunch of babies
01:40:30 you can't handle the man's game
01:40:32 4chan is a force ultimately for good
01:40:34 I love 4chan because all I do
01:40:36 is look at the pictures
01:40:38 and I don't read anything
01:40:40 I don't like 4chan because I can't understand
01:40:42 the least terrible
01:40:44 message board on the internet
01:40:46 that I've ever seen
01:40:48 you haven't been on MLP board
01:40:50 that one is easily the most terrible
01:40:52 oh it's fine
01:40:54 that's not how we got into 4chan at first
01:40:56 I'm very shitty now
01:40:58 but at the time it was like
01:41:00 every third thread
01:41:02 has a post that makes me laugh
01:41:04 wow way better than anywhere else
01:41:06 on the internet because I'm on the internet
01:41:08 and I hear about how 4chan is this terrible awful place
01:41:10 where everything just sucks
01:41:12 all the time daily constantly
01:41:14 I go there and it just seems like people are
01:41:16 consistently more funny than anywhere else
01:41:18 and they're more real than anywhere else
01:41:20 4chaners who are proud
01:41:22 to be 4chaners
01:41:24 4chan pride
01:41:26 because I'm a little proud
01:41:28 I identify as a 4chan guy
01:41:30 I think being proud to be a 4chaner is antipathical to 4chan
01:41:32 culture
01:41:34 4chan is good
01:41:36 it breeds this 4chan pride attitude of
01:41:38 we're in a secret club and us 4chaners
01:41:40 we're cool we know what's really real and what's going on
01:41:42 I do hate elitism
01:41:44 you know what really annoys me is when there's
01:41:46 a war between tumblr and 4chan
01:41:48 I'm reddit and I'm like
01:41:50 I go to waller sites they're fine
01:41:52 who cares
01:41:54 I don't really post on 4chan much
01:41:56 because I just am not good at writing in their personality
01:41:58 when I make a post it just sounds like
01:42:00 people always go go fuck back to reddit
01:42:02 anytime I post on 4chan
01:42:04 that's the real problem with 4chan
01:42:06 and for most group think it's just another fucking
01:42:08 who's fucking Skype is going off
01:42:10 is that me I'll kill me
01:42:12 who the fuck is doing it
01:42:14 what is that noise
01:42:16 it's fine
01:42:18 best guy ever you are
01:42:20 you're an amalgamation of all the
01:42:22 worst traits of humans
01:42:24 I'm an amalgamation of all the best traits of 4chan
01:42:26 is what I am I took it all
01:42:28 which means you're the worst of all humans
01:42:30 is exactly what I just said
01:42:32 what's the next meme munchie
01:42:34 okay this is the big one
01:42:36 well I need to go last
01:42:38 I'll come up with another one
01:42:40 okay water bottles literally just
01:42:42 like fucking tap water
01:42:44 I bought it in an outrageous price
01:42:46 I don't want to pay like one dollar
01:42:48 for a bottle of water when I could just drink it
01:42:50 on my tap
01:42:52 hey munchie
01:42:54 every comedian from the year
01:42:56 2000 called
01:42:58 shit
01:43:00 but it's true
01:43:02 their message didn't seem to have an impact
01:43:04 it is a little sad that people are still
01:43:06 drinking it after so many comedians
01:43:08 made the point that they
01:43:10 I didn't even know that anyone else thought about it
01:43:12 oh man you clearly don't watch it
01:43:14 up comedy
01:43:16 or even biggest problem in the universe
01:43:18 what's going on
01:43:20 I've been using
01:43:22 the same water bottle for about a year
01:43:24 I've just been refilling it
01:43:26 wow
01:43:28 you're getting a little bit of the plastic shit
01:43:30 in your body if you keep using that
01:43:32 I know I'm probably going to die
01:43:34 but it's pretty good
01:43:36 I'm just saying if you're using one water bottle
01:43:38 do what I do and just get a really big one
01:43:40 I don't drink water
01:43:42 I hate the meme that foldable chairs
01:43:44 are not comfortable
01:43:46 I'm seeing a foldable chart now
01:43:48 literally the most comfortable I've ever been in my entire fucking life
01:43:50 you just remind me of a meme
01:43:52 I don't know how to feel about it
01:43:54 it's the meme that whenever I listen to stand up comedy
01:43:56 or listen to cultural criticism stuff
01:43:58 all the things I do make me a poor
01:44:00 fat midwestern American
01:44:02 going to Walmart, I used to eat at McDonald's
01:44:04 everything about my lifestyle
01:44:06 I'm with you on that
01:44:08 but then when I have an opinion
01:44:10 about some societal issue
01:44:12 I'm a privileged elitist
01:44:14 coddled, silver spoon, born
01:44:16 person who's never known anything about struggles
01:44:18 or not having tons of money
01:44:20 I don't know
01:44:22 and this has been the airing of grievances
01:44:24 by the DeVoo
01:44:26 we'll see you next week for more
01:44:28 I agree
01:44:30 I'm a little annoyed when people
01:44:32 make it out like
01:44:34 Walmart, middle America
01:44:36 literally everyone goes to Walmart
01:44:38 there are things that you can only
01:44:40 get at Walmart
01:44:42 where Walmart's the only convenient place to go
01:44:44 it's like
01:44:46 you go on the internet and you hear about how
01:44:48 we're
01:44:50 regular people and there's all these rich fat cats
01:44:52 and they look down on people and then you can go to
01:44:54 peopleofwalmart.com
01:44:56 look at how poor they are
01:44:58 I'm like, oh come on people
01:45:00 well, the joke with people of Walmart isn't better
01:45:02 it's just a joke
01:45:04 it's just offended by that joke
01:45:06 as you feel like you need to
01:45:08 oh man, that doesn't mean it needs to die
01:45:10 if a joke offends you, that means it's true
01:45:12 my rebuttal to that is always
01:45:14 I'll say, hey you know
01:45:16 I went up to some black people at a diner last week
01:45:18 and said, you being black means you have
01:45:20 less intellectual fortitude
01:45:22 but that's true
01:45:24 it's like, you know
01:45:26 no, you're doing it wrong
01:45:28 so that's a stupid thing
01:45:30 by the way, plenty of things can piss you off
01:45:32 even if they're completely not true
01:45:34 like, accusing, um, you know
01:45:36 nerd culture or whatever of being sexist
01:45:38 oh, it pisses them off, they're being defensive
01:45:40 that's because, you know, it's been a big
01:45:42 controversial issue that people have
01:45:44 obviously it's not always true
01:45:46 hey everybody, you destroy all nerds
01:45:48 get out!
01:45:50 Ben, are you recording?
01:45:52 you're a whole hour and twenty minutes into this
01:45:54 we already did that
01:45:56 I am recording and I'm ready to go, let's continue
01:45:58 don't mind me
01:46:00 hey Ben, since you're here, we're doing memes
01:46:02 that need to die, do you have a meme that needs
01:46:04 to die?
01:46:06 nope
01:46:08 okay, moving on
01:46:10 amazing contribution you've made
01:46:12 I'm glad I came
01:46:14 Munchy?
01:46:16 I have the biggest one
01:46:18 okay, I have this written down
01:46:20 memes are fucking funny
01:46:22 stop talking about them all the fucking time
01:46:24 ironically slash dank meme lovers
01:46:26 I hate you, memes are fucking great
01:46:28 yeah, I like memes
01:46:30 so the idea of memes being overused
01:46:32 I'm with you on this side too
01:46:34 I had the problem with the word memes
01:46:36 I love how as soon as Ben came back to this podcast
01:46:38 we went back to the original
01:46:40 topic
01:46:42 when Jesse got here, it all went crazy
01:46:44 when Ben gets here
01:46:46 I'm here to enforce the rules
01:46:48 of this podcast
01:46:50 Ben is a stern authoritarian
01:46:52 nobody talk over each other, nobody interrupt
01:46:54 each other, given
01:46:56 we need that bell
01:46:58 you know what Ben, rules
01:47:00 are a meme that needs to die
01:47:02 I had it with your rules
01:47:04 Jesse Wood is a meme that needs to die
01:47:06 okay
01:47:08 these memes need to kill each other
01:47:10 my meme is a meme that needs to die
01:47:12 I'm with Munchy's meme that
01:47:14 people who haven't seen Highlander
01:47:16 is a meme that needs to die
01:47:18 Highlander is the most important meme
01:47:20 in American cinema history
01:47:22 anyway
01:47:24 I think memes can be pretty funny
01:47:26 I still think Dam Daniel
01:47:28 is pretty fucking funny
01:47:30 someone said Dam Daniel to me
01:47:32 someone said Dam Daniel to me the other day
01:47:34 and I didn't know what it meant
01:47:36 it was a funny phrase
01:47:38 this guy made a ton of vines
01:47:40 of him observing his friend
01:47:42 Dam Daniel
01:47:44 back at it again with the white vans
01:47:46 it's pretty funny
01:47:48 you said that
01:47:50 reminded me of a meme that needs to die
01:47:52 a youtube channel called I hate everything
01:47:54 is a meme that needs to die
01:47:56 this fucking guy is not funny
01:47:58 he's not funny
01:48:00 he's not interesting
01:48:02 he never says anything remotely original or unique
01:48:04 he just jumps on every fucking bandwagon he can
01:48:06 all of his videos are monotonous
01:48:08 droning bullshit
01:48:10 he fucking hops on fucking e-drum of bandwagons
01:48:12 he hops on meme bandwagons
01:48:14 every fucking video he does gets up
01:48:16 forward to the front of Reddit because
01:48:18 oh man it's a channel and he rants and he hates things
01:48:20 he's not even fucking funny
01:48:22 that guy is fucking trash
01:48:24 he's
01:48:26 his whole career is built on e-drama
01:48:28 and on the fact that he has a funny face
01:48:30 and everyone wants to draw his cartoon avatar
01:48:32 everyone wants to suck his stupid dick
01:48:34 the thing I hate about I hate everything
01:48:36 oh and if anyone's wondering
01:48:38 the thing I hate most
01:48:40 that guy had a video about hating Dam Daniel
01:48:42 by the way
01:48:44 just want to throw this out there
01:48:46 my series fuck everything
01:48:48 by about two years
01:48:50 and is much better
01:48:52 the thing I hate about I hate everything
01:48:54 is that his name is very generic
01:48:56 so every time I think to myself
01:48:58 oh I'm feeling really bad
01:49:00 I hate everything I think of his channel
01:49:02 and I don't want to
01:49:04 he has ruined the phrase
01:49:06 I hate everything
01:49:08 he's made it unfun to say
01:49:10 I say we just ignore him
01:49:12 because hopefully he can become less
01:49:14 that's a meme that needs to die
01:49:16 actually is people thinking that
01:49:18 not commenting on something will make it go away
01:49:20 I don't think that usually works most of the time
01:49:22 no I think it will
01:49:24 it reminds me of another meme
01:49:26 of like
01:49:28 if someone is criticizing you about something
01:49:30 and you go well if I just don't acknowledge it
01:49:32 then it will go away I think a lot of times
01:49:34 that just doesn't work because I remember at one point
01:49:36 the irate gamer coming out with a video
01:49:38 saying that I was always fully aware
01:49:40 of the fact that
01:49:42 it's a much more complicated situation
01:49:44 ripping off AVGN
01:49:46 for context the irate gamer was a guy who came out in 2007
01:49:48 who obviously ripped off AVGN
01:49:50 oh no he was an irate gamer dude
01:49:52 oh I bet there's plenty of people who don't
01:49:54 because lots of people haven't been on that one
01:49:56 I have no idea who the irate gamer is
01:49:58 he has 157,000 subscribers
01:50:00 which is, you know, marginal
01:50:02 anyway the point is he came out with a video saying
01:50:04 I never wanted to comment on the fact that
01:50:06 my videos were so similar to AVGN
01:50:08 I never really wanted to stand up for myself
01:50:10 and then he had this 30 minute video
01:50:12 you know, if you had said all that
01:50:14 when it happened you probably would have
01:50:16 defused a lot of the video
01:50:18 and it does sort of help you see his side of it
01:50:20 but I don't know if it
01:50:22 defends him from the fact that he's not funny
01:50:24 and has like shitty wooden acting
01:50:26 and a terrible show
01:50:28 the whole point was that he was
01:50:30 not creative enough to make it seem
01:50:32 like he wasn't ripping him off
01:50:34 ripping off AVGN
01:50:36 so earlier on someone said I'm glad you came
01:50:38 and that reminded me of a meme
01:50:40 I realized, the lack of boy bands
01:50:42 there need to be boy bands because they're funny
01:50:44 to have in our culture, you know
01:50:46 they say so much in our culture
01:50:48 I've been listening to some Beatles
01:50:50 I listened to the first Beatles out of the way
01:50:52 Are you considering the Beatles a boy band?
01:50:54 I mean they didn't
01:50:56 DeVoo
01:50:58 come to America
01:51:00 DeVoo, a traditional boy band
01:51:02 We are going to try to classify
01:51:04 the type of thing we do
01:51:06 we just do what we like
01:51:08 yeah, that's the thing
01:51:10 cause those boy bands do
01:51:12 just worry about trust
01:51:14 cause imma give mine a baby can't you see
01:51:16 it doesn't matter
01:51:18 Backstreet Boys are infinitely superior
01:51:20 to NSYNC, I'll just throw that one out there
01:51:22 right now so everyone knows
01:51:24 that's a whole other podcast
01:51:26 no strings attached
01:51:28 I know the Beatles became more interesting
01:51:30 and I am much more interested in that stuff
01:51:32 but their first album especially kinda sucks
01:51:34 it's 100%
01:51:36 because one direction is today
01:51:38 like one direction is amazing
01:51:40 one direction fucking rules
01:51:44 because of
01:51:46 I've never had
01:51:48 the Beatles were really
01:51:50 artistically influence
01:51:52 make an analysis that explains
01:51:54 why
01:51:56 let me tell you right now
01:51:58 why the Beatles are a terrible example
01:52:00 of a boy band, it's because
01:52:02 they made their own music the entire time
01:52:04 they evolved through that process
01:52:06 they weren't figure heads the way the typical boy bands are these days
01:52:08 I don't care
01:52:10 all my definition of boy bands is a bunch of guys
01:52:12 who make songs about how they're all gonna
01:52:14 well that's their shitty definition but okay fine
01:52:16 because I like it because it represents
01:52:18 where our culture is at that time
01:52:20 and it's really funny that
01:52:22 it's a nice thing to be able to gently make fun of
01:52:24 it's so cheesy haha
01:52:26 we got one direction I guess
01:52:28 there was this sudden wave of boy bands
01:52:30 or at least there was supposed to be one
01:52:32 boy band who did the song I'm glad you came
01:52:34 that song which has double entendre
01:52:36 in the lyric that I love
01:52:38 but then one direction was the only one that stuck
01:52:40 around
01:52:42 it kind of sucks because the whole point
01:52:44 is to have lots of them
01:52:46 the whole point is to have lots of them
01:52:48 because they can all compete
01:52:50 like we had back in the 60's
01:52:52 like we had in the 90's
01:52:54 but now we have a boy band monopoly
01:52:56 today and that's just not nearly
01:52:58 as interesting
01:53:00 when you said I'm glad you came
01:53:02 and all that it reminded me of a meme
01:53:04 that I think maybe needs to die
01:53:06 which is the meme that women
01:53:08 are like really hard to please
01:53:10 sexually and men just
01:53:12 get off constantly at all times
01:53:14 there's like this huge disparity
01:53:16 in the way that women and men
01:53:18 have sex and everything
01:53:20 I think it's like way
01:53:22 blown out of proportion by like comedians
01:53:24 like you know where it
01:53:26 it can be funny but I think it's
01:53:28 affected the way people actually think about
01:53:30 these things where like
01:53:32 I think women are just as sexually
01:53:34 open and like into weird shit
01:53:36 and able to like be stimulated
01:53:38 as men are
01:53:40 that's a meme that women care about sex
01:53:42 or want at all they don't I can confirm that
01:53:44 they're not interested at all
01:53:46 most of the women I've talked to are pretty
01:53:48 fucking promiscuous
01:53:50 they say that but they're just trying to impress you
01:53:52 it's all a big fugazi
01:53:54 it's not real don't be fooled
01:53:56 when I had sex with my ex
01:53:58 girlfriend she was coming all the time
01:54:00 and I was coming rarely so I felt like
01:54:02 it was a reversal of everything
01:54:04 have you considered that she might have been a man originally
01:54:06 there's this girl who I've talked to for a long time
01:54:08 on the internet and
01:54:10 she shares a lot of the stuff I'm into
01:54:12 she's more intensely into
01:54:14 those things but I am
01:54:16 into other things that are also more
01:54:18 intense than she is into
01:54:20 so I don't know I think it's kind of a mixed
01:54:22 my point is that there's no
01:54:24 there's this idea that
01:54:26 all women are harder to please
01:54:28 and that is not the case
01:54:30 it's highly independent on the person
01:54:32 that's fair
01:54:34 yeah whatever
01:54:36 let me bring it back
01:54:38 a second let me talk about an actual
01:54:40 thing relating to memes that need to die
01:54:42 here's what I hate
01:54:44 okay
01:54:46 the whole modern
01:54:48 slash poll alt-right movement
01:54:50 the political spectrum there
01:54:52 it all couches itself in fucking memes
01:54:54 and makes itself like funny
01:54:56 and approachable
01:54:58 as part of its like marketing
01:55:00 like Hitler was right and shit
01:55:02 and I hate it yes the whole
01:55:04 every meme that comes out of poll
01:55:06 is nothing but like a funny sort of
01:55:08 packaging method for these terrible
01:55:10 alt-right ideas about how we need to create
01:55:12 a fucking ethno-state
01:55:14 and it drives me up the fucking wall
01:55:16 wow Ben you know a fucking white
01:55:18 thanks for ruining this hilarious podcast
01:55:20 with that deeply insightful fucking social
01:55:22 commentary
01:55:24 you're welcome
01:55:26 I have to realize
01:55:28 that most of those people are just being ironic
01:55:30 shit posters and they aren't funny and I still hate them
01:55:32 no that's how it starts
01:55:34 they start by ironically shit posting
01:55:36 that Hitler was right
01:55:38 at this point there is no way
01:55:40 to tell the difference between the people who made it
01:55:42 sincerely and the people who were joking
01:55:44 it's kinda like the
01:55:46 gamergate thing people start out agreeing
01:55:48 with like the funny meme part of it
01:55:50 but then they kinda get something
01:55:52 I got in the poll
01:55:54 and I was like wow finally
01:55:56 a place on the internet where people agree with me
01:55:58 on something
01:56:00 but then as I continued to be on it
01:56:02 I could no longer tell
01:56:04 if the anti-semitism was a joke or not
01:56:06 it's like gamergate
01:56:08 some of them are serious
01:56:10 I saw this big graphic that was like
01:56:12 here's all the things that Auschwitz really was
01:56:14 exactly it was like what
01:56:16 you hate neutrality worship so much
01:56:18 but you know what you get when you don't have neutrality
01:56:20 worship you get poll and gamergate
01:56:22 and you get fucking channels like
01:56:24 something out of a car that do nothing but keep saying
01:56:26 don't get involved people
01:56:28 we're in a bad place
01:56:30 we're gonna be here
01:56:32 let's get out
01:56:34 over and over again
01:56:36 that's what you get when you don't appreciate
01:56:38 and respect neutrality
01:56:40 neutrality is to be expected
01:56:42 I don't want to be appreciated
01:56:44 there's a bunch of fucking ideologues
01:56:46 pushing their agenda
01:56:48 two teams of monkeys
01:56:50 oh god
01:56:52 oh god this is the worst
01:56:54 there's no man left in the middle
01:56:56 you have no neutrality
01:56:58 these cacophonies are in the neutrality
01:57:00 podcast
01:57:02 okay okay okay everybody
01:57:04 shut the fuck up
01:57:06 here's my meme that needs to die
01:57:08 is the idea that people aren't going to take
01:57:10 everything to its logical extreme
01:57:12 if it proposes something to be done in society
01:57:14 people will go well
01:57:16 we're gonna do that today but in 50 years
01:57:18 it's gonna be like the super extreme version
01:57:20 you're like what no it's not
01:57:22 and I go yeah probably is
01:57:24 every single thing that humans ever do is extreme
01:57:26 I believe completely in the slippery slope
01:57:28 and that's my meme that needs to think
01:57:30 is the idea that the slippery slope is a fallacy
01:57:32 I think it's a 100% real thing
01:57:34 I think fallacies are a meme that needs to die
01:57:36 thanks for bringing that up
01:57:38 anytime some stupid asshole brings up like debate fallacies
01:57:40 and like in like a conversation
01:57:42 I'm with you here
01:57:44 holy shit that's annoying
01:57:46 you insulted me so that means you're wrong
01:57:48 you know Jesse I gotta say
01:57:50 I don't get people saying that
01:57:52 accusing me of fallacies but
01:57:54 I will say that while I think your style
01:57:56 of arguing makes people think you are
01:57:58 committing fallacies when you aren't
01:58:00 I was arguing with a commenter the other day
01:58:02 and he said
01:58:04 you're not responding to my questions
01:58:06 you're just using adhamanim
01:58:08 you're insulting me
01:58:10 listen up motherfucker
01:58:12 this is not a debate
01:58:14 debate fallacies do not apply
01:58:16 outside of a debate when you come to me
01:58:18 and try to insult me
01:58:20 I don't have to play friendly by the rules
01:58:22 of fucking courteous debate with you
01:58:24 I can call you a stupid asshole
01:58:26 if you're acting like a stupid asshole
01:58:28 it's not a fallacy it's the truth
01:58:30 the whole reason that adhamanim is a fallacy
01:58:32 is because an adhamanim is when you think
01:58:34 that attacking someone is
01:58:36 for your ideas
01:58:38 but usually you're just trying to make
01:58:40 the point is you suck ass in your dipshit
01:58:42 if the point you're trying to argue
01:58:44 is that someone is an asshole
01:58:46 calling them an asshole is very much
01:58:48 in service of that and is not a fallacy
01:58:50 I want to extend this a little bit
01:58:52 out to just copy paste arguments
01:58:54 in general which are all memes
01:58:56 if you're copying and pasting
01:58:58 some argument that is like
01:59:00 the rhetoric that everyone else is using
01:59:02 because like it's just
01:59:04 it's very much with all the fallacies
01:59:06 and everything
01:59:08 I think the point of knowing the fallacies
01:59:10 is understanding them
01:59:12 it's not winning an argument by going
01:59:14 you did adhamanim you lose
01:59:16 it's like if you understand
01:59:18 that kind of fallacy
01:59:20 then maybe you can make an argument
01:59:22 from the perspective of knowing that
01:59:24 that's three times you said fallacy instead of fallacy
01:59:26 I don't give a fuck
01:59:28 I think fallacy sounds cooler
01:59:30 let it go the first two times with the third one
01:59:32 okay let's move on
01:59:34 my point is that you don't need to
01:59:36 just copy it
01:59:38 I think probably one of the worst things
01:59:40 that ever happened
01:59:42 now that I'm thinking about it
01:59:44 was Idea Channel made these little videos
01:59:46 explaining fallacies
01:59:48 and they encouraged people
01:59:50 to take those and when someone
01:59:52 makes that fallacy to link them to video
01:59:54 and that is the
01:59:56 total opposite of what you should be doing
01:59:58 because every conversation is its own scenario
02:00:00 knowing those things
02:00:02 can help you to argue
02:00:04 but in each individual scenario
02:00:06 you don't go you broke the
02:00:08 code of conduct
02:00:10 there's a reason that rules are supposed to be flexible
02:00:12 to that situation
02:00:14 on the internet
02:00:16 people are smarter than they are
02:00:18 in your life
02:00:20 comparatively speaking
02:00:22 in terms of arguing
02:00:24 people
02:00:26 offline or at least around where I live
02:00:28 people do ad hominems
02:00:30 and red herrings all that kind of stuff
02:00:32 it's because when you're doing it in a text medium
02:00:34 you have time to think about your responses
02:00:36 that's exactly what I mean
02:00:38 I've almost never seen an ad hominem
02:00:40 I see your point of view
02:00:42 but I have the exact opposite conclusion
02:00:44 people are smarter
02:00:46 in real life when it comes to arguing
02:00:48 because in real life they fight
02:00:50 and they punch each other
02:00:52 which I respect way more
02:00:54 you know I might respect that more
02:00:56 cherry picking
02:00:58 debate fallacies out of a list that he found somewhere
02:01:00 I respect
02:01:02 cherry picking is a fallacy
02:01:04 are you accusing him of a cherry picking fallacy
02:01:06 I'm just going to bring up
02:01:08 I'm accusing him of being dumb dipshits
02:01:10 I'm going to bring up briefly
02:01:12 ad hominem
02:01:14 I don't want to focus on this too much
02:01:16 but this whole copy paste argument thing
02:01:18 I think this is exactly
02:01:20 if I were to try to get to the heart
02:01:22 of what bothers me about SJW
02:01:24 what I think it actually is
02:01:26 when it's a problem
02:01:28 is when it's this
02:01:30 it's when it's people who have read
02:01:32 an argument on tumblr
02:01:34 and they've decided it's true
02:01:36 and they just keep repeating it all the time
02:01:38 to every situation
02:01:40 without actually
02:01:42 the proliferation of toxic and problematic
02:01:44 because those are the words
02:01:46 if one of us makes a rape joke
02:01:48 in this video and then someone comes in
02:01:50 and they're not making an argument
02:01:52 they're just pasting an argument for why it's wrong
02:01:54 in all contexts that they got from tumblr
02:01:56 and they'll copy paste their response
02:01:58 right in there
02:02:00 I've seen so many times where it's like word for word
02:02:02 something someone read somewhere
02:02:04 and they've had that idea
02:02:06 like when we talked about
02:02:08 like Tom just the other day
02:02:10 got some shit for saying rape in the video
02:02:12 even though rape is defined
02:02:14 in the way that he was intending to use it
02:02:16 so it's completely wrong
02:02:18 and that's what happens when you're following
02:02:20 the use of different words instead of actually
02:02:22 looking into it
02:02:24 the idea channel thing about link to anyone
02:02:26 if they use a straw man or an ad hominem
02:02:28 it's like I almost never see ad hominems
02:02:30 I never see it online anyway
02:02:32 so I don't know what the point of that video is
02:02:34 you never see anyone call someone a fucking idiot online
02:02:36 I just never see it used as a substitute
02:02:38 for an actual argument except in the procrastinator's chat
02:02:42 not even there really
02:02:44 really not even there to be honest
02:02:46 but what I see as fallacies
02:02:48 it's a whole lot of really advanced versions
02:02:50 of straw man
02:02:52 or red herrings
02:02:54 it's way more advanced stuff
02:02:56 what the fuck is red herring
02:02:58 a literary device
02:03:00 no red herring was the bully on a pup named
02:03:02 scooby-doo
02:03:04 they always talk about it
02:03:06 it's usually like more
02:03:08 specific more detailed fallacies
02:03:10 that are more complicated
02:03:12 you're being a real red herring right now
02:03:14 this name was for red herring
02:03:16 and fucking freddy
02:03:18 freddy always thought it was red herring
02:03:20 because he was a bully
02:03:22 but then velma would always prove him wrong
02:03:24 I've never heard of red herring
02:03:26 you know really fred was the bully
02:03:28 because red herring never did anything
02:03:30 yeah
02:03:32 yeah that's true
02:03:34 I've also never seen a pup named scooby-doo
02:03:36 munchie give us another meme that needs to die
02:03:38 I'm not a fucking endless well of these things
02:03:40 I ran out
02:03:42 you said that you had like a hundred at the start
02:03:44 you said you had a notebook
02:03:46 no backlights
02:03:48 on your fucking nintendo
02:03:50 systems this happened like a
02:03:52 million years ago but it's still relevant
02:03:54 because I bought a gameboy sp and the backlight
02:03:56 still isn't even good the best backlight
02:03:58 is on the nintendo ds in fact the nintendo ds
02:04:00 is the best gaming console ever
02:04:02 well munchie handheld consoles
02:04:04 in general are a meme that needs to die
02:04:06 because it's gonna be worthless
02:04:08 no no no
02:04:10 please let's not have this argument again
02:04:12 we have like 20 minutes on this last part
02:04:14 for no reason
02:04:16 I just want to say that coming into this
02:04:18 chat late I just
02:04:20 I don't know if I love or hate that memes that
02:04:22 need to die is basically just things we don't
02:04:24 like
02:04:26 it's not so much
02:04:28 things we don't like as cultural
02:04:30 ideas we don't like like things that a lot
02:04:32 of people seem to believe in
02:04:34 tomato tamada
02:04:36 that's what memes are
02:04:38 isn't there a whole part
02:04:40 in metalgear solid about how like they hate memes
02:04:42 because it's changing like wasn't that
02:04:44 what metalgear 2 is about
02:04:46 and then in rising they're all like we need to increase the memes
02:04:48 which I wholeheartedly support
02:04:50 wait what
02:04:52 the plot of metalgear solid is
02:04:54 the plot of metalgear solid is that memes will
02:04:56 overtake everyone's minds
02:04:58 it's very comfortable nobody has individual thought
02:05:00 it's amazing because it's slow
02:05:02 the Kirby games aren't supposed to be fast
02:05:04 it's supposed to be enjoyable experience
02:05:06 that's why Kirby 64 is the best game ever
02:05:08 that I'm gonna come to your house and rip your balls off
02:05:10 and have the best power the power combined thing is
02:05:12 the meme that needs to come back to Kirby
02:05:14 the meme that Kirby 64 doesn't rule
02:05:16 I don't like that meme
02:05:18 is that a meme who says that Kirby 64 is amazing
02:05:20 everyone says it's too slow
02:05:22 it's too slow
02:05:24 it is too slow
02:05:26 it's too much like the old ones
02:05:28 when
02:05:30 all you gotta do is click
02:05:32 harder on your stick and you'll run faster
02:05:34 you can dash
02:05:36 or you can just be a pro
02:05:38 and just get firepower and use it for max speed
02:05:40 harder on your stick
02:05:42 how about the meme
02:05:44 the meme that needs to die
02:05:46 is the meme that Nintendo has never brought back
02:05:48 the power combining from Kirby 64
02:05:50 that's what Guy just said
02:05:52 it's totally right
02:05:54 it's a nightmare that they haven't
02:05:56 and it's sheer laziness
02:05:58 what I do like is that they make up new powers
02:06:00 but the combining was the best thing ever
02:06:02 that ever happened in my life
02:06:04 Kirby game I played
02:06:06 and every game that I play that doesn't have it
02:06:08 it feels incomplete
02:06:10 in the one with the mice
02:06:12 they had a thing
02:06:14 where you could combine powers
02:06:16 but they didn't become new powers
02:06:18 there were like four unique powers
02:06:20 one was like fire sword or something
02:06:22 but that's so weak
02:06:24 it's super weak
02:06:26 what they all need to do is make a new one
02:06:28 first Kirby game too and I was also disappointed
02:06:30 is somebody now playing Kirby 64
02:06:32 sounds like it
02:06:34 what? oh sorry
02:06:36 well guys
02:06:38 I think we should move on to the
02:06:40 what I know for a fact you will all agree
02:06:42 let's move on to our final
02:06:44 we need to have the final place
02:06:46 which is the fact that we don't all have
02:06:48 7 million subscribers
02:06:50 each
02:06:52 that's just the general idea
02:06:54 and they have to be different subscribers
02:06:56 that's a huge meme so everyone go to all of my patron
02:06:58 go to patreon.com
02:07:00 you'll find it on my page
02:07:02 give me all your money
02:07:04 make me do shit because people
02:07:06 one day we can all work together
02:07:08 and make projects together

02:07:20 it's going to be analysis HQ
02:07:22 it's going to be where we're all teamed together
02:07:24 okay fine
02:07:26 that is the working title
02:07:28 I want to call it the best buddies bungalow
02:07:30 I like that
02:07:32 the BBB
02:07:34 the BBB I like it
02:07:36 it'll be like the BBC
02:07:38 I'm telling you guys if this ever happens
02:07:40 over our office I'm going to make a wooden plaque
02:07:42 and get mounted over the front door
02:07:44 what about the procrastinator's pro tier
02:07:46 paradise
02:07:48 DCPTP
02:07:50 that could work
02:07:52 I want you all to move
02:07:54 into my house in Medford, Massachusetts
02:07:56 I want you all to kill my
02:07:58 downstairs neighbors
02:08:00 and move into their apartment
02:08:02 and I'll have the best time
02:08:04 I'm serious everyone come live with me
02:08:06 I know that DG is like pretty attached to his current lifestyle
02:08:08 I'm not
02:08:10 and then I'm going to live with Victor and you guys have to come into Victor's house
02:08:12 like um
02:08:14 I don't know I don't think most people know this
02:08:16 but my internet really sucks because I live in a rural neighborhood
02:08:18 so I can only upload youtube videos
02:08:20 like in the middle of the night
02:08:22 it sucks I can't
02:08:24 it's a shame that DG has a family
02:08:26 and I don't
02:08:28 but you have a family
02:08:30 Jesus
02:08:32 my family is a disappointment
02:08:34 your family exists though
02:08:36 you don't not have a family
02:08:38 they just aren't very great
02:08:40 well
02:08:42 I think it's only fair
02:08:44 to make it fair that we make DG's family
02:08:46 as shitty as Jesse's is
02:08:48 to equal everybody out
02:08:50 it's the only way to be fair
02:08:52 let's put fluoride
02:08:54 in Vic's drinking water
02:08:56 hey my family is awesome
02:08:58 they just can't deal with bad words
02:09:00 that's the only reason I need to get out of here
02:09:02 fair enough that's a fair reason
02:09:04 I just can't
02:09:06 man I can't deal with this slow internet bullshit
02:09:08 it's bad I can't deal with it
02:09:10 I gotta move I'll live in a freaking bunker
