00:00:00 I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:13 Hello. It's morning in America. That's not true. It's 3pm.
00:00:20 It's not true.
00:00:21 Recordingly.
00:00:22 It's the one time it isn't morning in America.
00:00:25 Any other day, any other week, I could have said that.
00:00:28 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're back for some reason.
00:00:33 Okay. What's up?
00:00:38 Well, it's up for me.
00:00:39 Oh, oblivionful is here. Hello.
00:00:43 I'm back-ish. I was away for a while.
00:00:48 Were you?
00:00:49 Oh, yeah.
00:00:50 Yeah, I couldn't do anything.
00:00:51 Like away from the podcast or away from something else?
00:00:55 Away from being able to record anything, whether it be PCP or drawcast or anything else, because
00:01:03 I was helping Kai recover from his top surgery because he got it.
00:01:08 Right.
00:01:09 Yes.
00:01:10 All right, that happened.
00:01:11 Well, I didn't know that was happening, but makes sense. Well, how is he feeling? Good?
00:01:18 He's feeling okay.
00:01:19 Cool.
00:01:20 He's mostly got all those functions back. He just can't lift his arms over his head for a while.
00:01:26 Maybe a couple more months, he'll be a fully functional human again.
00:01:31 I can only imagine, but it probably hurts. I mean, I would guess.
00:01:40 They take a samurai sword to it and just go.
00:01:44 Just slice fatides right off.
00:01:46 One single, it's an EI motion.
00:01:50 Jesus.
00:01:51 God, I don't want to.
00:01:52 Yeah.
00:01:53 And his blood is spurred to go through everywhere.
00:01:58 All over the floor, out the window.
00:02:01 Look, I didn't get a good look at it.
00:02:04 I think I walked past Fatidhi Ben when the surgeon was letting me check up on him afterwards.
00:02:07 Are you serious?
00:02:10 What?
00:02:11 Are you serious?
00:02:13 Well, there was just a bin that had like some blood stains around it.
00:02:16 I didn't peek inside.
00:02:17 What do you mean a bin?
00:02:19 Oh, God, no.
00:02:21 It's not like the kind of bin you have in your house.
00:02:24 I know.
00:02:25 It was like on wheels.
00:02:26 It was made out of some sturdy looking plastic.
00:02:30 It was like a mobile contraption.
00:02:33 It was just in the hallway next to the room where the surgery had taken place.
00:02:38 I would not.
00:02:40 What do you expect?
00:02:41 Are we going to put it in jars?
00:02:42 Look, I don't know.
00:02:44 I just wouldn't want to see that.
00:02:46 I don't know.
00:02:48 You dissolve it in acid.
00:02:51 Same as you do with people that assassinate presidents.
00:02:55 Same as you do to people on Breaking Bad when you kill them.
00:02:58 That was the top of last week.
00:03:00 Damn.
00:03:01 Did that happen?
00:03:02 Who did they dissolve in acid?
00:03:04 They dissolved a bunch of people.
00:03:06 They dissolved Crazy8 and that other guy.
00:03:09 Oh, in the bathtub.
00:03:11 Right, right, right.
00:03:12 In the bathtub, then they dissolved some other guy.
00:03:16 Oh, the Victor who was like Gus's guy.
00:03:19 Gus slices him across the throat and they do that.
00:03:22 Then there was that time the boy got shot by what's his face when they were doing the train robbery.
00:03:28 They had to put him in acid.
00:03:30 I mean, the character is called Todd.
00:03:34 So it goes.
00:03:36 So it goes.
00:03:37 Todd in the shadows.
00:03:39 Todd was a freak.
00:03:41 He was an incel.
00:03:43 That's the most dangerous villain of all.
00:03:46 He was, I mean, yes, he was not good with women.
00:03:51 He's very awkward, but he's scary because he's like actual psycho behavior.
00:03:59 He doesn't have any sense of remorse or sadness when killing happens.
00:04:08 He's just like, yeah, yeah, I killed him.
00:04:11 I mean, it's no emotion comes through.
00:04:15 It's like whoopsy.
00:04:18 It's not even whoopsy.
00:04:20 He just doesn't think much of it.
00:04:23 And then like when he like locks up Jesse as like a slave to make meth for them.
00:04:29 He's just like, he acts as if Jesse is one of his friends.
00:04:33 He's like, hey, little buddy.
00:04:34 But he's like still like keeping him as a slave.
00:04:37 Hey, little buddy, whom I tortured.
00:04:39 How are you doing?
00:04:42 How are you doing, buckle?
00:04:44 How was he doing?
00:04:46 Not good.
00:04:48 That's too bad.
00:04:51 At least he can lift his hands over his head.
00:04:56 At least he didn't have his chest at least severed with a samurai sword.
00:05:01 Alyssa is not forced to sleep on his back for a month and a half, possibly two months.
00:05:07 Yeah, so he should sleep on your back.
00:05:10 I can't.
00:05:11 I mean, imagine a lot of people do that.
00:05:13 I don't sleep on your front.
00:05:16 Like if you got butt surgery and you have to sleep face down.
00:05:19 That's fine.
00:05:20 I should get that because I'm already doing what you need to do to deal with it.
00:05:26 Sleeping face down is what you do when you're dead because you don't have to breathe.
00:05:31 Face down?
00:05:33 Yeah, sleeping on your face.
00:05:36 I find it very difficult to sleep face down.
00:05:39 I can only sleep on my side.
00:05:40 I can't sleep on front or back.
00:05:42 I used to sleep on my side.
00:05:43 Now I sleep face down always.
00:05:47 Where does your nose go?
00:05:50 I mean, I don't know.
00:05:52 I have like a pillow in my head.
00:05:54 Is your head turned to the side?
00:05:55 Are you straightening your neck?
00:05:56 No, no.
00:05:57 I keep my face directly straight forward, like directly nose pointed towards the core
00:06:03 of the earth into the pillow.
00:06:06 No, yeah.
00:06:07 I turn my head to the side.
00:06:08 I keep my arms, arms up, arms up crossed, head on the arms, head to one side.
00:06:16 Sometimes my neck hurts, but not usually.
00:06:19 What do you mean arms up?
00:06:20 How are you?
00:06:21 As in my arms, like above.
00:06:24 Oh, like above, yeah, yeah, I get it.
00:06:27 Like forward, like I'm laying on my front and arms.
00:06:29 I was thinking like you were crossing them backwards over your back.
00:06:31 No.
00:06:32 Like behind your back.
00:06:34 Arms up from my downwards sideways laying orientation.
00:06:41 If you understand.
00:06:43 But like if you're trying to say.
00:06:45 Where do your giant titties go?
00:06:47 Do you have like holes cut out in the back?
00:06:49 That's a secret that I will take to my grave.
00:06:54 Maybe we should get new.
00:06:55 Maybe we should get new to draw a comic about that.
00:06:59 Not so at all.
00:07:02 I mean, I would like to see a new, new comic.
00:07:05 True.
00:07:06 That would be cool.
00:07:08 I guess we can.
00:07:09 I was inspired by new.
00:07:10 I drew Gib with giant titties a few weeks ago.
00:07:14 Yeah.
00:07:15 When did, when was that?
00:07:17 It was a birthday gift.
00:07:18 Yeah.
00:07:19 Oh, I don't know if I saw that one.
00:07:20 Well, it turned into a birthday gift, I think.
00:07:22 You were planning to do it anyway, but it was great.
00:07:24 I started drawing it and I was like, I was like slow because, okay.
00:07:29 I was recovering.
00:07:30 He took my bed and the futon that he was sleeping on,
00:07:33 we just put in the closet and I've been sleeping in the living room,
00:07:36 I guess to give him space, but for the first week,
00:07:40 he couldn't like leave the bed at all except to like use a bathroom,
00:07:43 I guess.
00:07:44 So I was using his computer in our room and just changing,
00:07:48 like just putting on like long YouTube videos to help him sleep
00:07:51 because he was like, he had a lot of pain medication and he was just
00:07:54 kind of sleeping for like most of the first week.
00:07:57 And the plan was to use his Sintiq and draw a little bit,
00:08:01 but it was hard because the Sintiq is clunky.
00:08:05 Sintiqs are not as good as XP pens in my experience having used both of them now.
00:08:11 But yeah, I wanted to draw like for the whole like couple weeks,
00:08:15 I'd be looking after him.
00:08:17 I only got a little bit of drawing done and one of them was a drawing a gib
00:08:21 and it was taken a long time because I was distracted by a bunch of things.
00:08:26 But then, but then I found out, oh, give his birthday tomorrow.
00:08:30 And I'm like, oh, shit.
00:08:31 I can't, I don't know if I can finish that in time,
00:08:33 but I'll, I'll try and get it done soon.
00:08:36 And then I did a couple of days later.
00:08:38 Oh, yeah.
00:08:40 And I guess I can, we can't exactly, we'll have to like censor it
00:08:45 because there's some nudity, but I can post here.
00:08:49 I haven't posted it anywhere outside of big boobie mommy milkers yet.
00:08:53 Oh, that's the place for it.
00:08:55 That is the place.
00:08:57 That's early access to the place to be.
00:09:00 I want to guess my Patreon discord slot too, but I'll just drop that in the chat.
00:09:07 Well, there they are.
00:09:09 Yep.
00:09:11 What do you draw in?
00:09:14 Program.
00:09:16 I use clip studio paint.
00:09:18 I also use clip studio paint.
00:09:20 I got frustrated with it.
00:09:22 I got mad at it this week.
00:09:24 What did it do to you this weekend?
00:09:26 Uh, uh, what did I, what did I need?
00:09:29 I needed to, oh yeah, I was working on, I'm trying to finalize the like print files
00:09:36 for the slime and punishment book and I needed to adjust the greens.
00:09:43 I needed to adjust my colors to account to, to minimize the damage
00:09:49 that converting from RGB to CMYK.
00:09:52 Yeah, so I'm trying green.
00:09:54 It's very hard to print for some reason.
00:09:56 I remember.
00:09:57 So I'm trying to like, you know, reduce the harm that will be done
00:10:02 and to do that I'm trying to, I need, I wanted to make a layer
00:10:08 that would basically apply a filter only to areas that were green, right?
00:10:13 I wanted to, you know, maybe shift the hue into more of the yellow
00:10:17 to make it a little easier to print
00:10:19 or maybe just brighten them to account for the loss of saturation
00:10:22 or something like that.
00:10:23 Uh, and it was just impossible to do it in Clip Studio Paint.
00:10:27 It just doesn't have what it takes.
00:10:30 There's no, I couldn't even like, even though, like, oh yeah,
00:10:35 that's more of a Photoshop thing.
00:10:37 Yeah, I ended up having to use Photoshop.
00:10:39 I ended up having to use Photoshop and then once I gave up on Clip Studio
00:10:44 and I went to Photoshop, I found how to do it in like five minutes.
00:10:47 I was like, oh, okay.
00:10:48 It's literally just a button I can hit.
00:10:50 Well, that's as close to yours for art.
00:10:51 And Photoshop is for image manipulation in general.
00:10:54 Yeah.
00:10:55 I mean, it seems like a lot of people draw in Photoshop.
00:10:59 It's funny.
00:11:00 I think Photoshop, a lot of people got into Photoshop as a drawing tool,
00:11:06 not really thinking to use it as an image manipulation thing
00:11:09 because it was like, ah, this is really good for all these things,
00:11:12 all these tools.
00:11:15 But actual drawing programs are much more limited on all that extra stuff.
00:11:20 So you sort of, if you started with Photoshop,
00:11:23 it seems like all these other programs are missing something.
00:11:27 You know, I tried to...
00:11:28 It's actually not true.
00:11:29 I started out thinking I could do it.
00:11:31 I was like, okay, I'll take the layer, I'll duplicate it,
00:11:35 and then I will, you know, use the color curve tools
00:11:39 to take away all the blue and the red and leave only the green.
00:11:44 And that gave me a layer, but the whites still became...
00:11:49 It kept the whites, and I was like, okay,
00:11:51 but I want to get rid of the whites.
00:11:52 I only want to keep the things that are green and not anything else.
00:11:57 So then I did that, and then I did it again,
00:12:01 but I took away the green,
00:12:03 so I was left with something that was only blue and red.
00:12:05 And then I subtracted that purple layer from the green layer
00:12:09 to get one that was all the greens
00:12:11 and nothing that was not specifically green.
00:12:13 And then I had sort of a map layer of the original image,
00:12:19 and I was like, okay, now I want to use this sort of brightness map
00:12:23 as a, what's the word, a mask for a, you know,
00:12:28 an adjustment layer to change hue and brightness.
00:12:32 And you can't do it.
00:12:33 You can't like copy paste an image to be a mask layer
00:12:38 for like a color adjustment layer.
00:12:40 The only thing you can do to like the mask for that is like,
00:12:46 just draw directly, like erase areas with like an eraser tool.
00:12:51 And that sounds so convoluted.
00:12:54 Yeah.
00:12:55 And after effects, you could just like literally use
00:12:58 via the Luma key, like select the green, like a green screen,
00:13:01 but instead of removing it, you use that to like create like a mask
00:13:07 where you can like have like a more brightly saturated green
00:13:11 or where you could just like apply like hue, like filters and shit
00:13:13 to like the green parts to like make them stand out more.
00:13:16 You can do that with a couple layers.
00:13:18 In Photoshop, there's literally, I couldn't believe it.
00:13:23 All you had to do was make a hue adjustment layer
00:13:27 and there's just a button in the layer panel.
00:13:30 That's like, do you, you can like select where on the color spectrum
00:13:34 you want it to specifically apply to.
00:13:36 It's literally just, there's a button for it.
00:13:39 You don't have to do anything.
00:13:41 I couldn't believe it.
00:13:42 Yeah.
00:13:43 So that was neat, I guess.
00:13:46 I was glad to discover.
00:13:48 I was glad that I gave up on Clip Studio Paint quickly.
00:13:51 Oh, her vast specific task, yeah.
00:13:55 I was a little intimidated by Photoshop.
00:13:57 I haven't really used it that much.
00:13:59 I find it kind of a hassle.
00:14:02 And sometimes it has trouble like launching on my computer for some reason
00:14:05 because I have a pirated copy.
00:14:08 I didn't pay for it.
00:14:10 I have a paid for copy in it.
00:14:12 I can confirm it's slow as fuck.
00:14:14 My biggest issue with Photoshop is though.
00:14:17 There's funny things you can do with like caching things
00:14:21 and stuff to make it run quicker.
00:14:24 I don't know.
00:14:25 There's tutorials.
00:14:26 I've ever had similar problems.
00:14:28 I had to look into like how to make Photoshop boot up quicker.
00:14:33 And there are like some things you can do.
00:14:37 But it worked out fine.
00:14:39 It was pretty good.
00:14:41 If it boots up quickly, I'm still going to be annoyed.
00:14:44 Photoshop is just filled with a bunch of like little annoying things
00:14:47 that just make me pull my hair out.
00:14:50 Like the workflow, especially for like art,
00:14:52 the workflow in Clip Studio is a lot faster.
00:14:56 Like messing with layers and stuff like that
00:14:58 is just a lot quicker and easier and more intuitive, I feel.
00:15:02 But Photoshop has one glitch
00:15:04 that is the worst fucking thing in the world.
00:15:06 Like let's say like you click on a layer
00:15:08 and you click on the opacity
00:15:10 and you want to change it from like 100 to 50
00:15:12 and then you go to click out.
00:15:14 The opacity button will stay selected like no matter what you do.
00:15:17 And then I'll like try to like go to some other box
00:15:20 to change the brush size and I type in 20 for brush size.
00:15:23 Even though I clicked on the brush size box,
00:15:26 it'll change the opacity to 20 instead.
00:15:29 And I can't like deselect opacity
00:15:32 or if I'm trying to change the zoom.
00:15:34 Because in Clip Studio, you can just like,
00:15:36 I just have a wheel on my tablet that lets me zoom in and out.
00:15:39 That doesn't work on Photoshop.
00:15:41 So I have to type in the zoom level manually
00:15:43 and when I go to type it in, it just changes the opacity layer
00:15:46 to just font size layer or whatever.
00:15:48 Like any box where you type in a number,
00:15:50 it won't let you deselect it for some reason.
00:15:52 And you have to like try clicking out of it
00:15:55 like 20 times before it works.
00:15:57 And I fucking hate it.
00:15:58 It's been like this for the last couple of updates.
00:16:00 And it's annoying.
00:16:02 I scream when I use Photoshop.
00:16:05 It sucks.
00:16:09 I like Photoshop for doing like sweeper and hella Jeff style.
00:16:15 Like Photoshop fuckery.
00:16:17 Oh, I'm just messing things up.
00:16:20 And like it looks bad on purpose.
00:16:23 It's the perfect program for that.
00:16:25 It looks bad in ways you couldn't even imagine
00:16:28 that things could look bad.
00:16:30 It looks bad in ways you couldn't imagine.
00:16:32 New ways to ruin art.
00:16:36 Very nice.
00:16:37 Very good.
00:16:38 It's true.
00:16:41 I'm trying to look for...
00:16:44 I got a thing to say.
00:16:48 It's not that big a thing.
00:16:51 Is it like that misfit song?
00:16:54 Is there a song where the misfits that goes like
00:16:58 I got something to say
00:17:00 I raped your mother today.
00:17:02 I'm pretty sure that's a song.
00:17:05 It's not that.
00:17:08 It's there's heat wave time in the UK.
00:17:12 Today it reached like 30 degrees,
00:17:16 which is like 87 or 86 Fahrenheit.
00:17:22 Tomorrow though,
00:17:24 it's going to go predicted to go to 40,
00:17:28 41 degrees,
00:17:30 which is 106 Fahrenheit.
00:17:34 It's the highest temperature,
00:17:38 potentially not happened yet.
00:17:40 Biggest temperature ever to be recorded in the UK.
00:17:44 Wow, really?
00:17:46 Yes.
00:17:47 And a few summers ago,
00:17:50 it was like 38 point something centigrade.
00:17:54 And now it's 41.
00:17:56 It's like Mediterranean like
00:17:59 summer levels in the UK,
00:18:02 which is not very exciting.
00:18:04 That's very exciting for you.
00:18:06 No, it's no.
00:18:07 We don't have.
00:18:08 I love that for you.
00:18:09 We don't have the facilities.
00:18:11 People are definitely going to die of heat related things
00:18:16 like dying.
00:18:18 I don't know how you die from heat.
00:18:20 Like a water probably.
00:18:21 I'll show you.
00:18:24 Damn.
00:18:27 Air conditioning is not common
00:18:29 because we don't need it.
00:18:31 And it's expensive.
00:18:33 And the buildings are designed to keep.
00:18:35 That's what you think winter.
00:18:37 Yeah.
00:18:39 Because it does like big old green houses,
00:18:41 but they're bricks.
00:18:43 Well, I don't know about green.
00:18:46 Brown house green.
00:18:48 I didn't paint it.
00:18:49 Brick Brown.
00:18:52 So yeah, to today,
00:18:54 green, whether you can't,
00:18:55 you can't print those then.
00:18:57 You can't print the CMYK.
00:18:59 How the fuck did they make green paint?
00:19:01 It doesn't make any sense.
00:19:04 Green is like the anti-pain.
00:19:06 It would consume itself and vanish from the surface.
00:19:09 This is an Omega based play for an artist,
00:19:14 like a real physical artist.
00:19:16 You take green paints
00:19:19 and you make a really big green image.
00:19:21 And then when people try to like,
00:19:23 I don't know, sell like prints of it,
00:19:25 it's not going to look as good.
00:19:26 You got to actually go to the museum
00:19:28 and see it or own it.
00:19:30 It's a real experience sort of thing.
00:19:34 Paint with green.
00:19:38 Oh, you know, I ordered a test,
00:19:41 a bunch of like paper samples
00:19:44 from this company called
00:19:46 Comics Wellspring,
00:19:48 which has horrible pricing.
00:19:50 Absolute horrible.
00:19:51 I would never actually buy from them.
00:19:53 Thanks for the samples, you suckers.
00:19:56 But they do offer.
00:19:58 You can do a thing where like,
00:20:00 you can designate an area of the page,
00:20:02 but they'll put like foil in the page.
00:20:04 You know, you can have like a little like,
00:20:06 a little like reflective foil kind of poke through
00:20:09 some parts if you want it to be shiny.
00:20:11 It's like, what if I made it,
00:20:12 what if I made it like green foil?
00:20:14 What if I made the slime, you know,
00:20:18 reflective green?
00:20:20 Wouldn't that be nifty?
00:20:22 That would be nifty.
00:20:24 I think there are, okay,
00:20:26 there are fluorescent inks
00:20:29 that you could print with,
00:20:31 but if they're not standard,
00:20:33 it would have to be like a custom job.
00:20:35 I'm sure it would balloon the price.
00:20:38 And I mean, the price is fucking high enough already,
00:20:41 printing a whole book in full photo color.
00:20:43 So, you know, sorry, it's terrible.
00:20:47 Just terrible.
00:20:49 Although I did find a company on Alibaba
00:20:52 that seems to have some like pretty decent price.
00:20:56 I found one that I think I might be able to get them
00:20:59 for like a hundred copies for like $15 a piece,
00:21:04 including shipping, which is like, that's pretty good.
00:21:07 That's pretty good as long as the quality is not terrible.
00:21:09 So, yeah, I'm hoping that.
00:21:13 Hoping that works out.
00:21:14 She won't, she hasn't gotten back to me.
00:21:15 She's bad about responding.
00:21:17 I asked that lady for a template.
00:21:20 I was like, can I have a page template, please?
00:21:22 And then it was Friday.
00:21:23 And I think like her shift ended.
00:21:25 And then she didn't get back to me and I'm waiting for Monday.
00:21:28 I'm gonna have a goddamn page template.
00:21:31 I'm sending my damn files.
00:21:33 Damn.
00:21:35 That's, that's, that's what's going on.
00:21:37 You know, I was doing some crafts this week.
00:21:40 I had some ideas for things that I could potentially do
00:21:43 as stretch goals for the Kickstarter.
00:21:45 And I've been crafting.
00:21:49 I learned how to etch a glass.
00:21:52 Which is, yeah, with like chemicals.
00:21:56 With like a, um.
00:21:58 Like you put a stencil and you just spread a thing on a glass.
00:22:03 Yes.
00:22:04 I found, okay, most of the time, like stencils like that,
00:22:09 they're like not reusable.
00:22:11 But I found a company called Icon Art that sells these stencils,
00:22:16 or it's like a system for making stencils that are reusable.
00:22:20 Like they are a sort of like vinyl covering over a fine mesh.
00:22:26 And so you can sort of get a design into the vinyl
00:22:30 that will hold together and it won't fall apart when you use it.
00:22:33 And it's theoretically reusable.
00:22:36 But you have to do it.
00:22:38 Okay.
00:22:39 They sell this system for doing it that costs like two or $300.
00:22:43 And it comes with like these sheets of this like, you know,
00:22:47 this mesh and coating.
00:22:50 And then it comes with this stand with like a black light,
00:22:53 or like a UV light.
00:22:55 And you're supposed to put your design over it
00:22:57 and then shine the black light on it.
00:22:59 And then that will like do some reaction to the coating.
00:23:02 And then you rinse it off.
00:23:03 And like if you did it right,
00:23:05 the covered parts that you covered with your design
00:23:10 wash off the stencil and the parts that were uncovered
00:23:14 that got exposed to UV light,
00:23:16 like they harden and they stay on.
00:23:18 And this is how it creates this reusable design.
00:23:22 And so I was like, that sounds great,
00:23:24 but I don't want to spend $300.
00:23:26 So I just bought the, I bought some sheets of the stuff
00:23:30 and then I just bought my own little like black light
00:23:34 and I just fucked around with it.
00:23:36 I cut out a little piece and I did experiments with it.
00:23:38 And I found out just how to do it myself.
00:23:40 Didn't buy the stand,
00:23:42 saved like $150 because I just figured out
00:23:46 how do you kind of sort of shine my own little light on it
00:23:49 and get it to work.
00:23:51 Fuck you icon art.
00:23:53 I love your product.
00:23:55 And that was my, that's my story.
00:23:58 It's my glass etching story.
00:24:00 What are you etching into the glass
00:24:03 and what sort of glass is it?
00:24:05 Like is it the size of a little key chain?
00:24:08 It's a, it's a bottle.
00:24:10 It's bottles.
00:24:11 Oh my God.
00:24:12 Yeah.
00:24:13 You're going to put slime in a bottle with etched glass.
00:24:17 I won't admit that that's what I'm going to do.
00:24:21 That's insane.
00:24:23 Do you want to, yeah, do you want to see?
00:24:25 Oh, I can show you.
00:24:26 I do want to see.
00:24:27 I saw you post a picture of slime earlier.
00:24:29 All right.
00:24:30 Well, give me a second and I will show you what I've got.
00:24:33 Yeah.
00:24:34 That, that one pencilmation episode featuring Ben St is coming true.
00:24:39 Wait.
00:24:40 Why?
00:24:41 What, what happens?
00:24:42 Because you're going to fall into a slime.
00:24:45 Um, one second.
00:24:49 I got to take a picture.
00:24:51 Actually, I got to take two pictures because I'll show,
00:24:53 I'll show you in, in like regular light.
00:24:56 And I'll show you in black light because it looks really good.
00:25:01 Now, I don't know.
00:25:02 This might be like too much.
00:25:03 This might be too much work and impossible.
00:25:05 So like,
00:25:06 I feel like the amount of labor and materials you're putting in is unheard of.
00:25:13 I might, it might be going a little bit up for it.
00:25:17 That could be like a super high donation thing.
00:25:21 The etching doesn't really, it's kind of hard to see.
00:25:27 Ah, it's kind of hard to see on the camera.
00:25:33 Okay, I'll show you.
00:25:34 You can see it on an empty bottle.
00:25:36 They're all filled with slime.
00:25:39 Okay, here we go.
00:25:42 It's, it's a little bit hard to see.
00:25:45 All right, come on.
00:25:47 Yeah.
00:25:48 Uh, all right, give me a sec.
00:25:50 I got to find my, I got to find my black light.
00:25:54 The only thing I know black lights for is that they show semen.
00:26:01 Wow.
00:26:02 Because they use that in the, the shows where they're like, what's, let's find.
00:26:08 Oh, there's for blood.
00:26:09 They find blood as well.
00:26:11 But mostly I remember the semen.
00:26:16 I remember the semen.
00:26:17 Maybe it doesn't find blood actually.
00:26:18 I'm not sure.
00:26:19 I don't think it finds blood.
00:26:21 Luminal finds blood.
00:26:23 That's the different thing.
00:26:26 Yeah.
00:26:27 I remember that from Ace Attorney on DS, the secret extra thing, the lady, science lady.
00:26:37 I know that from Detective Conan from the other thing called Japan.
00:26:44 They're both from Japan.
00:26:46 Wow.
00:26:47 I'm sorry.
00:26:48 Detective Conan.
00:26:49 I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
00:26:51 I'm back.
00:26:52 Welcome back.
00:26:53 Show this stupid, stupid.
00:26:58 Oh, Marin.
00:27:00 Marin's going to get excited when he sees this.
00:27:03 Oh.
00:27:04 Oh.
00:27:05 Oh my God.
00:27:06 Yeah.
00:27:07 It looks pretty good, right?
00:27:09 Yeah.
00:27:10 Hang on.
00:27:11 Yo.
00:27:12 It's blowing up big.
00:27:13 So like product of New Los Angeles City, AKA Neo Milwaukee.
00:27:19 That looks, that text looks very clean.
00:27:22 That is kind of a big bottle.
00:27:24 I was thinking of like a tiny little slime thing.
00:27:28 It's like a smallish, like olive oil bottle.
00:27:33 Yeah.
00:27:34 It's like a shower gel.
00:27:36 It looks like.
00:27:37 It's only six or eight fluid ounces that it actually holds.
00:27:45 So anyway, that's what I did this week.
00:27:49 I mean, I didn't spend the whole week on that.
00:27:51 But like I bought, I think I bought this stuff like shortly after we discussed.
00:27:57 I think on the PCP last week, I said, haha, what if I gave people slime?
00:28:03 And now it's here.
00:28:04 And now there it is.
00:28:06 Be disastrously expensive to ship.
00:28:10 Not if I pretend that it's not in the box and I ship with media mail.
00:28:18 Here's the thing.
00:28:19 I hope that works out.
00:28:20 Oblivion fault.
00:28:21 Here's the thing.
00:28:22 We talked about this last week.
00:28:24 And the book is already going to be disastrously expensive to ship.
00:28:30 True.
00:28:32 The only way that it won't be is if I use media mail.
00:28:35 I'm going to just kind of, I'm going to try and like send some shit through media mail
00:28:40 that like technically shouldn't be sent through media mail and just like see if it works.
00:28:44 And like if it works, I'm just going to do that.
00:28:47 And like if some of them get caught, like, oh well.
00:28:51 Alternatively, you could just make it up the price that people have to pay for it.
00:28:56 So that way it works out.
00:28:59 I want, I will, I will have to charge for shipping.
00:29:03 I mean, I mean, I don't want to charge people more money.
00:29:07 That's bad.
00:29:11 Foreign shipping will be like $40.
00:29:16 So that's, so that's a nightmare.
00:29:18 That's a nightmare.
00:29:19 But I think if I, if I can get away with using media mail domestically, then I think I can
00:29:25 slightly overcharge for shipping domestically and then like undercharge for fucking, you
00:29:34 know, I don't want to charge people $40 shipping for international.
00:29:37 And because like most orders will not be international, I feel like I might be able to get away with
00:29:43 that margins wise.
00:29:48 That's my, that's my plan.
00:29:52 If I actually had to spend like $30 on shipping every individual order, which is like what
00:29:57 it is, I don't know, that's like, that almost makes me think I just shouldn't do it.
00:30:02 So, you know, that can't, that can't be true.
00:30:07 Yeah.
00:30:11 All right.
00:30:14 That would, that's my crafts.
00:30:16 That's my craft.
00:30:18 Craft corner with Ben.
00:30:20 Thanks.
00:30:21 It's edible.
00:30:22 It's, it's, it's edible by the way.
00:30:24 You can eat it.
00:30:25 Oh, you can eat.
00:30:26 Okay.
00:30:27 Yeah.
00:30:28 I mean, I probably wouldn't want to because it's so cool.
00:30:31 Yeah.
00:30:32 What, what is it?
00:30:33 Is it like, is it syrupy?
00:30:35 It is.
00:30:36 I mean, it is mostly not to, not to, not to break the illusion or anything, but it is mostly
00:30:41 corn.
00:30:42 No, no, don't say it.
00:30:43 It's mostly, it's mostly corn syrup.
00:30:45 No, the illusion shattered.
00:30:47 The slime is mostly corn syrup.
00:30:49 It's, it, you heard it here.
00:30:51 Yeah, true.
00:30:53 It's quite, it's quite tart.
00:30:55 It's quite sour.
00:30:56 It's, it's good.
00:30:57 You could make a slime and tonic out of it.
00:31:00 Oh, you could put that in a shot glass and do a little slime shot.
00:31:05 Yeah, you could.
00:31:07 You know, I mean, you could, you could make, you could make your own if you wanted to.
00:31:11 Well, actually, I mean, the, the only like hard to find thing in it is like the fluorescent
00:31:17 the fluorescent additive that stuff.
00:31:20 I mean, I don't know.
00:31:22 You have to get it yourself.
00:31:24 That's a work around here.
00:31:26 Here's a media mail, minimum eight pages.
00:31:28 It's a book just explaining where to buy the bottle, how to do the glass etching, how
00:31:32 to make the slime, just all the instructions to make yourself at home.
00:31:36 My, my idea was that I would send it with the book.
00:31:41 So, oh, oh, you mean like instead of sending the bottle, just, just send a little pamphlet
00:31:47 explaining it.
00:31:49 Yeah.
00:31:52 Yeah.
00:31:53 Pay for my secrets.
00:31:55 I ordered a bunch of rocks too.
00:31:57 I ordered a bunch of different kinds of greenish rocks.
00:32:01 And we'll see which ones look the best and which ones are the most cost effective.
00:32:06 What do they got?
00:32:07 I got floor, I got calcite.
00:32:10 I got the, I don't think I bought, I don't think I bought green jade because I thought
00:32:15 that was stuff was kind of expensive.
00:32:19 Calcite is pretty cool though.
00:32:22 I'm optimistic.
00:32:23 The calcite looks pretty good in the promo photos.
00:32:27 I'm optimistic to see how that's going to look.
00:32:30 You got to secure all these rocks because if they, if they crack into the glass, you
00:32:34 get slime all over your book.
00:32:36 Yeah.
00:32:37 Yeah.
00:32:38 And in a box, I would probably fill it with like packing peanuts or something.
00:32:41 I would probably wrap every individual piece with like bubble wrap or something is the
00:32:47 idea there.
00:32:51 Where did I, I got Amazonites.
00:32:53 I don't think I'll use Amazonites.
00:32:56 I think it's that shitty company.
00:32:58 I don't, I don't feel like that's a good one.
00:33:00 Yeah.
00:33:01 Or no, no, no, not Amazonite.
00:33:02 Aventureen.
00:33:03 Aventureen is what I was thinking.
00:33:04 I don't think I'll go with that.
00:33:05 I think it's like more like a pale, like turquoise color.
00:33:08 So like, I got the crazy light, which I'd never even heard of before, but it's green.
00:33:13 So worth a shot.
00:33:16 And I think that's all I just got before.
00:33:19 I bought like a pound of each.
00:33:23 I don't know.
00:33:24 It's going to be fun.
00:33:25 It's going to be fun this week waiting for the, I know, I know.
00:33:29 I'm just having fun with it.
00:33:31 I'm just having fun with it, you know.
00:33:35 Very whimsically.
00:33:37 I just, I like making, making funny little, funny little themed gifts, I guess.
00:33:45 I don't know.
00:33:46 And trinkets.
00:33:47 You should have a real, you should have a potion shop.
00:33:50 You should have like a real, you could be a traveling like trinket vendor.
00:33:54 Bizarre.
00:33:55 Yeah.
00:33:57 Like the guy in at the beginning of Aladdin.
00:34:01 He sells the thing that makes Julian fries.
00:34:03 Yes.
00:34:04 Yeah.
00:34:05 Yeah.
00:34:06 He sells, he sells it on Alibaba.
00:34:11 Alibaba is.
00:34:12 That's the name of the camel.
00:34:15 Alibaba is so good.
00:34:18 They just have stuff for just.
00:34:22 Just have everything cheap.
00:34:23 Just have everything cheap.
00:34:24 Yeah.
00:34:25 There's like a, there's a million, there's a million vendors and they all have names
00:34:29 that I can't pronounce or even distinguish from each other half the time.
00:34:33 But if I sift through them, I will always find stuff at like half the price I would
00:34:37 pay for something from the Western of Western vendor.
00:34:42 Only then the shipping costs like 10 times as much.
00:34:44 So it's sort of evens out.
00:34:46 But unlike Western vendors that have things like minimum wage and all that expensive.
00:34:53 The children want to work.
00:34:55 How dare you bar?
00:34:56 How dare you keep all these children unemployed against their will?
00:34:59 Joe Brandon dark Brandon rising.
00:35:02 That's crazy.
00:35:04 Gas prices going down.
00:35:06 That's the worst of dark Brandon.
00:35:08 Gas prices going up.
00:35:10 Yeah.
00:35:11 Oh, fucking.
00:35:12 That was a thing that happened a couple of days ago.
00:35:14 Elon Musk and Trump were having a little fight.
00:35:17 They were having a little.
00:35:18 Oh, yeah.
00:35:19 A little spat.
00:35:21 I am that that Irish accountant that Irish like a finance YouTuber that I watch.
00:35:30 He had a video explaining the Elon Musk situation.
00:35:34 And Elon is like boned.
00:35:37 He's like totally toast.
00:35:39 Yeah.
00:35:40 It's like he didn't know what he was doing at any step.
00:35:43 He 100% is like by any reasonable metric like already agreed to buy the company and
00:35:49 there's no backing out.
00:35:51 Just look at that power stance.
00:35:55 Oh, does he actually have to spend the what was it 40 billion?
00:36:00 He might be able to negotiate a there was like a backing out fee of a billion.
00:36:05 But or but like the agreement was to buy it for 40 billion.
00:36:08 But like he's passed the point where he would have been able to just pay the 1 billion to
00:36:13 get out of it.
00:36:14 So he will probably have to either.
00:36:17 Go through with the deal and maybe he can negotiate a lower price than the 40 billion
00:36:22 or he will have to back out and probably negotiate a bigger fee than the 1 billion.
00:36:28 But it's, you know, going to cost him a lot.
00:36:31 Lol.
00:36:32 Yeah, lol.
00:36:33 He totally fucked it up.
00:36:34 I saw him like making means like coping means.
00:36:38 Yeah.
00:36:39 Twitter.
00:36:40 That will definitely be that are already being used against him in court.
00:36:45 Like his legal team.
00:36:47 Just should have told him don't post memes about an ongoing legal dispute.
00:36:54 Sir.
00:36:55 Sir Musk, please.
00:36:58 But he couldn't help it.
00:37:01 Can't help it.
00:37:02 No one tells him what to do.
00:37:03 Well, I hope he can.
00:37:05 That's it.
00:37:06 He's a very distasteful man.
00:37:08 The very distasteful man in my opinion.
00:37:11 You know what it isn't a distasteful man.
00:37:15 The Eye of Sauron.
00:37:17 Hmm.
00:37:18 Yeah.
00:37:19 True.
00:37:20 Did you know?
00:37:21 He is no man at all.
00:37:22 In fact, he is one of the Vaynor or whatever.
00:37:25 The Aeneir?
00:37:26 Yeah.
00:37:27 The deities of some kind.
00:37:30 There's like a, I forget all of the mythology.
00:37:33 I saw a YouTube video about it one time and I think I know what I'm talking about.
00:37:37 Yes.
00:37:38 Who'd you be graded a fucking video?
00:37:40 Oh, he's one of them.
00:37:41 He's one of them.
00:37:42 Yeah.
00:37:43 Yeah.
00:37:44 But like I noticed.
00:37:46 I noticed the other day that was just drawing endless war.
00:37:50 Just doodling him.
00:37:51 As one does.
00:37:52 Yeah.
00:37:53 And I was like, I'll draw endless war.
00:37:55 Just doodling him.
00:37:56 As one does.
00:37:57 Yeah.
00:37:58 And I was like, I'll draw endless mud next to him.
00:38:00 And it's like, wait a minute.
00:38:02 Eye of Sauron is an eye on a plinth on a pillar.
00:38:07 He must be related.
00:38:09 He must be like, he must be another endless.
00:38:12 The resemblance is uncanny.
00:38:14 Oh my gosh.
00:38:15 It's a little racist though, don't you think?
00:38:17 You think they all know each other?
00:38:19 Yeah.
00:38:20 Eyes.
00:38:21 They're so tall.
00:38:23 They have eyes.
00:38:24 They can look.
00:38:25 They can see each other.
00:38:26 Well, we just had the last RFCK art contest was about death furnaces.
00:38:33 And there were a bunch of different ones.
00:38:36 Let's see what was there.
00:38:37 There was Endless Oil, Endless Mochi, Endless Entertainment.
00:38:42 Endless Mochi.
00:38:43 Endless Mochi is awesome.
00:38:45 Prince Annihilation drew.
00:38:47 It's like a big mouth.
00:38:51 I want to see these.
00:38:53 I agree.
00:38:54 You know what?
00:38:55 I'll find that one.
00:38:56 There was also Endless Expansion in the Big Booby Mummy Mocha one, which is a giant dome
00:39:01 that looks like a booby.
00:39:03 That one's got to count for something.
00:39:05 That's on a death furnace.
00:39:07 That's a breast furnace.
00:39:09 Yes.
00:39:11 Let's see here.
00:39:18 I'm going to find it.
00:39:20 Sauron would be called Endless Search.
00:39:25 Endless Orcs.
00:39:26 The One Ring.
00:39:27 Endless Orcs.
00:39:28 Endless Pain.
00:39:30 Rar.
00:39:31 Rar.
00:39:32 He would say Rar.
00:39:36 Sorry.
00:39:38 I'm going to be quiet for a minute while I find the thing.
00:39:42 That's right.
00:39:43 I have a small in the middle tangent speaking of racism.
00:39:47 Yeah.
00:39:49 You know how GitHub got rid of master and slave terminology?
00:39:54 Oh, yeah.
00:39:55 I did hear about that.
00:39:56 No, I did not.
00:39:57 Some people, it's like a coding thing where one code drives another code or some shit.
00:40:05 I don't know.
00:40:06 I'm not a codeman, but they're like, we're changing the terminology because it's just
00:40:10 tasteful, which is like, sure, whatever.
00:40:12 I don't care.
00:40:13 Some people get super mad over it, though, which is funny.
00:40:16 Yeah.
00:40:18 Because we were talking about Photoshop earlier.
00:40:20 Ben was talking about getting rid of the whites, which I thought was really funny.
00:40:23 I did say that and I almost made a joke about it.
00:40:27 But listen, I was on an important tangent and I didn't want to get distracted.
00:40:33 I know.
00:40:34 I understood.
00:40:35 I laughed.
00:40:36 But there's another terminology that I hear a lot when talking about color grading, which
00:40:39 is crushing the blacks.
00:40:41 Yes.
00:40:42 I know about crushing the blacks.
00:40:44 Believe me.
00:40:45 How long are we going to keep that around for?
00:40:47 I wonder.
00:40:48 I haven't heard anyone talk about it being problematic, but I'm like, surely, surely
00:40:53 someone would complain.
00:40:54 It's fine.
00:40:55 What is it describing, though?
00:40:58 It's when you adjust the contrast of an image so that the dark areas become pure black.
00:41:09 Like 00 on the RGB, basically.
00:41:12 Yeah.
00:41:14 I don't have a problem with that one.
00:41:16 I feel like that is just describing what it is.
00:41:19 It's like darkening the blacks.
00:41:21 Darkening.
00:41:22 What did I see?
00:41:23 There was somebody on Twitter, I think, I saw someone added Crayola because they had
00:41:33 a black colored pencil and it said Negro on it.
00:41:38 And they were like, yeah, Crayola, what the hell is this?
00:41:41 And they were like, yes, we're an international company.
00:41:45 That is the Spanish word for black.
00:41:47 And he was like, no, he was actually mad because they also had the French translation and he
00:41:54 made a joke like, why would you include French?
00:41:56 I hate France.
00:41:57 It's like, ha, ha, ha.
00:41:59 Very, very, how drool.
00:42:02 Anyway, it's like that.
00:42:05 I mean, it's like that, though.
00:42:07 It's just the word.
00:42:10 It's also the word for the color.
00:42:13 Yeah.
00:42:14 I think the GitHub thing makes more sense just because many words can replace this fake
00:42:22 thing that you made up of a thing being in charge of another thing.
00:42:27 I've seen parent and child be used in a monster and slave.
00:42:31 We wouldn't want to offend any slaves who are using the code to build any programs for
00:42:40 their masters.
00:42:42 The thing that would be annoying is the code terminology changes and now all the coders
00:42:47 have to learn or their code breaks and they have to fix it.
00:42:52 But, you know, I don't know.
00:42:55 Here, I found not going to be a major problem.
00:42:58 I found this from Prince's Death Furnace art.
00:43:05 That's cool.
00:43:06 Well, that mountain has a big fucking sideways.
00:43:08 It was the dark spooky one.
00:43:10 That's Endless Oil.
00:43:13 He was new.
00:43:16 There was Endless Mochi.
00:43:18 That's Endless Mochi on the bottom right there.
00:43:20 I like that one a lot.
00:43:23 Just a mountain with a sideways mouth.
00:43:26 It's got that, I don't know if you call it, but that like sort of like flat cloud design
00:43:32 thing going on.
00:43:34 I don't know.
00:43:36 What do you mean?
00:43:37 I mean, the way that like the smoke looks, it looks like, I don't know, it looks like
00:43:44 a very stylized sort of like, oh, the clouds are a flat geometric shape.
00:43:51 In a sort of Asian way, I don't know how to describe it.
00:43:57 I mean, sometimes clouds do be like that.
00:44:00 Oh, what?
00:44:03 Yeah.
00:44:05 Sometimes they do have a flat bottom and then like a bulb is swirly atop.
00:44:10 And it's like, wow, that's just like Toy Story.
00:44:13 It's almost like art is based on real life.
00:44:20 It's almost like art is based.
00:44:23 Oh, no, I hate art.
00:44:26 I hate art now.
00:44:27 I don't like it anymore.
00:44:30 So thanks for that.
00:44:32 Yeah.
00:44:33 Thanks for reminding me how bad art is.
00:44:38 Yeah.
00:44:39 How much it sucks.
00:44:41 I have to pee.
00:44:42 I'll be back in a minute.
00:44:44 I have to clean.
00:44:45 I have to help clean.
00:44:46 We'll take a break and spend his pee.
00:44:48 I'll be back.
00:44:49 I believe in fall has gone for a second.
00:44:53 Ow.
00:44:54 Okay.
00:44:55 Well, now that's the episode.
00:44:59 No.
00:45:00 What do we go?
00:45:01 I mean, we've been going for a long time, right?
00:45:03 We've been good.
00:45:04 That's an episode.
00:45:05 That's another one in the can.
00:45:08 No, no, no.
00:45:11 Yes.
00:45:12 You must die.
00:45:13 Yes, yes, yes.
00:45:15 Kill me.
00:45:16 End it.
00:45:17 End this charade.
00:45:18 I can't do it.
00:45:20 You're so cute.
00:45:21 Come on.
00:45:22 Come on.
00:45:23 Pussy.
00:45:24 Nah.
00:45:25 Thor's gone away into boiling acid.
00:45:29 Fine.
00:45:30 World peace.
00:45:31 Okay.
00:45:32 Okay, I guess.
00:45:33 I don't know why we have open vats of boiling acid in world peace.
00:45:40 World peace?
00:45:42 What?
00:45:43 Are you describing a real phenomenon?
00:45:45 What are you talking about?
00:45:47 World peace?
00:45:48 I can't even comprehend this.
00:45:50 I just realized Elon's tie is a little short.
00:45:54 Elon's tie doesn't even reach to his belt.
00:45:57 Yeah.
00:45:58 You gotta have a lead lined tie and droop it low so that if you're hit with radiation,
00:46:10 your penis and genitals are protected with the lead in the tie.
00:46:17 So you can't get zapped by aliens with their radiation guns.
00:46:23 I continue to wonder whether I should shave my head or not.
00:46:30 I am continuously on the fence about whether my hair is worth keeping.
00:46:36 And I just can't.
00:46:39 Does it fill you with joy?
00:46:42 No.
00:46:44 Well, get rid of it.
00:46:46 Burn it.
00:46:47 Throw it away.
00:46:48 Well, that, I mean, would that make me feel even worse though?
00:46:55 Yes.
00:46:56 No, I'm already filled with that actually.
00:46:59 Fuck.
00:47:00 Yeah.
00:47:01 Sorry.
00:47:02 No more.
00:47:03 No vacancies.
00:47:04 There's no fixing that problem.
00:47:06 I mean, would you consider taking like chemicals to grow your hair back?
00:47:13 That's not something.
00:47:14 That's not an option.
00:47:17 It's not an option.
00:47:18 How do you know it's not an option?
00:47:21 Well, I know that you can't.
00:47:24 I mean, haven't you heard the freaking, what do you call it?
00:47:30 Keeps.
00:47:31 The keeps is the company that like advertises on YouTube.
00:47:35 You know, they say in their ads, you know, you can't reverse hair loss.
00:47:39 You can only, you can only prevent it.
00:47:42 Yeah.
00:47:43 So.
00:47:44 You got to get one of those Jordan Peterson hair transplants.
00:47:49 Your hair plugs.
00:47:51 You got to go that route.
00:47:53 Listen, I don't, I'm not going to say that I have never thought about it.
00:48:00 I don't know.
00:48:02 I don't know.
00:48:03 Certainly be a lot simpler to have a shaved head.
00:48:06 But yeah.
00:48:07 I don't know.
00:48:09 I don't know.
00:48:10 Wait, actually.
00:48:11 I don't like.
00:48:12 This might be true.
00:48:13 I hope maybe I'm misremembering.
00:48:15 What's that?
00:48:16 Does estrogen bring your hair back?
00:48:18 I, we just said no.
00:48:21 It doesn't.
00:48:22 Once the hair follicle is completely gone.
00:48:24 I don't think it does.
00:48:25 But.
00:48:26 I've, I've, I've heard.
00:48:27 Stop it from falling out.
00:48:28 I've heard the opposite.
00:48:29 But.
00:48:30 That like.
00:48:31 I mean, I've heard so many things about what estrogen does.
00:48:34 And there's no like, there's no absolute like certainty to a lot of it.
00:48:42 People are just hoping and like they've got a, what do you call it?
00:48:48 Small sample size.
00:48:50 What do you call that?
00:48:52 It's just one guy saying something.
00:48:54 Anecdotal evidence.
00:48:56 Anecdotal evidence.
00:48:57 There's a lot of anecdotal evidence and not a lot of research.
00:49:01 My favorite kind.
00:49:02 It's hard to know what is true about what estrogen does.
00:49:07 Obviously, obvious things like boobs growing and like skin changing.
00:49:13 So.
00:49:14 Softness and various other things.
00:49:16 For like.
00:49:17 Fat goes in.
00:49:18 The fat goes to your hips and thighs.
00:49:19 Hair is unknown.
00:49:20 As far as I understand.
00:49:21 It's, it's not, it's not unknown.
00:49:23 It doesn't bring your hair back.
00:49:25 There.
00:49:26 Well, I mean, maybe there's magical.
00:49:28 Ooh.
00:49:29 I mean, women are magical, I guess.
00:49:32 So like, who knows what could happen?
00:49:35 Well, all right.
00:49:36 I don't know.
00:49:37 I ain't seen the stats.
00:49:38 I ain't seen the truth.
00:49:40 I'm not holding out hope for it though.
00:49:43 I, my hair is receded already and I can't do anything about it.
00:49:47 At some point I might shave my hair off and start wearing wigs.
00:49:50 Cause it just doesn't look that good.
00:49:53 I think, I don't know.
00:49:56 I can say this before like.
00:49:58 On the one hand, maybe I'm just like, uh, maybe it's just cooler.
00:50:05 Maybe it's, it's just a cooler look.
00:50:08 And by look I mean in the more general sense, not of how you look in like visually, but
00:50:13 just how you look to others as a human.
00:50:16 It might just be a better look to just say fuck it and embrace whatever nature bestows
00:50:24 upon me.
00:50:25 I respect that.
00:50:27 I respect that sort of thing in others.
00:50:30 Uh, but do I have the courage to do it myself?
00:50:36 I'm going to say probably no, probably no, I lack that in my heart.
00:50:41 Seeing guys with, with no hair doesn't make me think anything in particular.
00:50:46 No.
00:50:47 It's just like a normal guy.
00:50:49 Yeah.
00:50:50 With a really bad receding hairline.
00:50:53 Seeing a really old guy with a full head of hair is like, wow, lucky.
00:50:58 That son of a bitch.
00:51:00 How do you do that?
00:51:02 Oh, he got the right gene.
00:51:03 Well, fuck you.
00:51:06 Fuck you, Gene.
00:51:08 You don't deserve happiness.
00:51:11 Uh, I don't know.
00:51:13 I just, I just want to complain.
00:51:15 I sort of complain about being old.
00:51:17 So thanks for letting me, let me do that.
00:51:20 No, it's, it's fine.
00:51:22 It's old.
00:51:23 We're all old here, except a blue and full.
00:51:26 Yeah.
00:51:27 Only a few years ago in Gib.
00:51:29 Where do you like 20, you know, like 27, right?
00:51:31 Yeah, I'm 27.
00:51:32 29.
00:51:33 Oh, you're 27.
00:51:34 No, I meant, yeah.
00:51:35 Yeah.
00:51:36 Yeah.
00:51:37 Okay.
00:51:38 I don't know.
00:51:39 Man, I don't know.
00:51:42 I just, uh, it's starting to, you know, I got, I got, I got, I got my thing that I'm
00:51:51 working on, not the book.
00:51:52 I mean the book too, but like, I got that video thing that I was going to make.
00:51:56 I've sort of have been more focused on just getting the book done lately.
00:52:00 I haven't been focusing too hard on it, but I, but I, I, I'm excited to make it.
00:52:06 I'm excited to finish it and put it out.
00:52:08 And like, I think people like it.
00:52:10 And, uh, so that's cool and all, but like, uh, I feel, I don't know.
00:52:18 I wonder if I've really like made the most of my, uh, my internet career.
00:52:24 Have I, have I really like, have I really done anything worthwhile with it?
00:52:30 I don't know.
00:52:31 I've been, I've been, yeah.
00:52:34 I mean, that's fine.
00:52:36 Yeah.
00:52:37 That's true.
00:52:38 No, those were good.
00:52:39 Those were, those were good and they were worth making.
00:52:41 Like I should have, I should have done more.
00:52:43 I should have done more and I'm, I don't know.
00:52:47 Uh, you know, I guess when I think about it, it's a little bit, it's a little rough that
00:52:57 like, hmm, my, my most, my most important achievements, if you just go by the numbers,
00:53:05 are just things wherein I like discuss some shit that other people made.
00:53:11 That makes me depressed.
00:53:14 Uh, you know, I think it's funny to talk about Sonichu or whatever.
00:53:19 It's funny to talk about, uh, fucking unicorn jelly, but it's a bit like, it's a bit, it's
00:53:26 a bit shit.
00:53:27 But like, oh yeah.
00:53:30 Ben saying that guy who talked about Sonichu, that guy who talked about unicorn jelly.
00:53:34 Yeah, that is, that is me.
00:53:36 That is my legacy.
00:53:39 I don't know what YouTubers are, but like half of them.
00:53:42 I know and they suck too.
00:53:43 Those people are also shit and worthless.
00:53:46 So there, they're not worthless.
00:53:48 You need to learn about how like the UI has one extra pixel on the side on a remake of
00:53:53 a video game.
00:53:54 That's true.
00:53:55 I love that content.
00:53:57 I gobble it up and, but I don't respect, but I don't respect it.
00:54:01 I actually don't like that content.
00:54:03 I don't, nothing against the people who make it.
00:54:05 I just like, why do people care about such a tiny little detail?
00:54:11 I mean, I don't know.
00:54:13 I don't know.
00:54:14 I mean, when I say that content, I mean like game related, like split speed run stuff I
00:54:20 like, even though it's like, it's pretty vapid at the end of the day, but I still like it.
00:54:25 I think it's, it's just what you make of it.
00:54:28 I've was watching, um, this guy called settled makes RuneScape content.
00:54:34 Yeah.
00:54:35 And, um, I found him from this odd like challenge run he's doing of an Iron Man RuneScape run,
00:54:43 where he can only move one tile if he gets a certain amount of experience.
00:54:49 And then I was like, oh, that series is still ongoing.
00:54:52 We'll wonder what else he's done.
00:54:54 And he's done like this, um, leveling every stat to 99.
00:55:01 Well, not every step.
00:55:02 I'm just like doing like everything you can, but, uh, relegated to one area of the entire
00:55:08 map where you can't do a lot of things normally.
00:55:11 And it's just an extremely tedious grind.
00:55:15 And he loves it.
00:55:17 Like he loves the, like he, he grinds for like 1500 hours trying to find this one thing.
00:55:24 So that he can get like, he can, he can finish, uh, like, uh, I don't know.
00:55:30 It's hard to explain because there's so many moving parts in RuneScape.
00:55:33 I don't even know the first thing about RuneScape.
00:55:35 Uh, you get experienced by doing crafts and fighting and leveling up and stuff.
00:55:41 Okay.
00:55:42 You run around, um, MMO.
00:55:45 Yeah.
00:55:46 I mean, I know, I know that much.
00:55:48 Yeah.
00:55:49 Uh, but he like, he gets really, really happy and excited whenever he breaches a milestone
00:55:55 or like a certain item drops that there's like one in 1600 drop chance and he's killed
00:56:01 like hundreds of these fucking enemies trying to get it.
00:56:03 And he gets it and he's like, oh, Pog.
00:56:06 He, and it's just like, I can't imagine.
00:56:09 Like, carrying.
00:56:11 I'm so jealous.
00:56:13 I'm so jealous.
00:56:14 For so long.
00:56:15 Like he, it's just his enthusiasm for the seemingly completely pointless, arduous, tedious task
00:56:22 of playing some video game.
00:56:24 His enthusiasm is infectious.
00:56:26 Yeah.
00:56:27 It makes me like really happy for him.
00:56:29 Yeah.
00:56:30 And everyone loves him and he's, he's just literally riding on cloud nine or whatever.
00:56:35 It's, it's, it's just great.
00:56:37 You know, when you're, when you're passionate about something.
00:56:40 Yeah.
00:56:41 It's like, uh, one, it's not work to, you know, do it.
00:56:47 And two, other people who might not even care.
00:56:51 Yeah.
00:56:52 They might just enjoy your enthusiasm for it.
00:56:57 And for, you know, for both of those reasons, that's like, oh, that's good content.
00:57:00 You know, if there's something you really care about and enjoy, it's like, hey, if you
00:57:05 turn that into content, you know, that's like, that's pretty good.
00:57:10 It's good work.
00:57:11 If you can get it.
00:57:12 Yeah.
00:57:13 So like, you know, yeah, I wouldn't like, I wouldn't have a problem.
00:57:18 I don't think there's anything wrong with like doing vapid content.
00:57:22 Yeah.
00:57:23 It's just whether you're enjoying what you're doing.
00:57:25 Yeah.
00:57:26 Yeah.
00:57:27 I guess Ben, did you enjoy making the lectures or, or like having the, the videos, other
00:57:35 videos you've made?
00:57:37 Um, yeah.
00:57:38 I guess, I guess, sure.
00:57:42 I mean, they only took me like, they didn't take very long.
00:57:46 Sure.
00:57:47 They were fun to make.
00:57:48 It's not like I've like spent that much time doing them.
00:57:52 They were so fleeting in the grand scheme of things.
00:57:56 Um, I guess, I mean, I think the reason they're, they're so like enjoyed is, is your enthusiasm
00:58:02 for the things you're talking about.
00:58:05 Yeah.
00:58:06 Like, I guess what I, I guess what bums me out a little bit is that I feel like it's
00:58:12 not that I think they were bad to make or anything, but I do feel like, uh, I don't know.
00:58:19 I just, I don't know where they leave me in terms of like, what, what can I, what is
00:58:25 my next move?
00:58:27 What, what is, what does Ben St. who has, you know, this list of things that he's done
00:58:32 and that he's somewhat known for?
00:58:34 Like, what does he do with that, uh, in terms of like, uh, I don't know.
00:58:44 Uh, I mean, you learned how to etch glass for like a potential slime bottle thing.
00:58:51 Yeah.
00:58:52 Yeah.
00:58:53 And.
00:58:54 Well, you could make funny, cool things on Etsy.
00:58:59 No, I hate it.
00:59:00 I hate that idea.
00:59:01 I hate it so much.
00:59:03 I don't know.
00:59:05 I don't know what you mean.
00:59:07 Like, you don't know what you mean on YouTube specifically.
00:59:10 I don't know.
00:59:11 Yeah.
00:59:12 Or whatever.
00:59:13 As a content creator or as a person who, or just as an artist, just as an artist in general,
00:59:18 like whatever that means.
00:59:20 Uh, I guess I'm just, uh, I don't know what to do with my life there.
00:59:29 That's it.
00:59:30 That's what I'm getting at.
00:59:32 Uh, this is, this is all part of my, this is all part of my crisis of being 34 and being like,
00:59:38 what have I done?
00:59:39 What have I done?
00:59:40 And now what do I do?
00:59:41 And, uh.
00:59:42 You're 34.
00:59:43 Yeah.
00:59:44 You should follow the rules.
00:59:47 What?
00:59:49 Draw porn.
00:59:50 Rule 34.
00:59:51 Oh.
00:59:52 Oh.
00:59:53 Isn't it?
00:59:54 Rule 34, when you hit 34.
00:59:57 You have to just draw porn.
00:59:59 That's all you can do.
01:00:00 I'm getting a head start.
01:00:02 I'm cheating.
01:00:03 I don't, I don't want to, I'm, I'm too, um, this might speak to like a broader failing
01:00:10 of me as a person, but I'm too like, I'm too shy.
01:00:15 I'm too shy to draw porn.
01:00:16 I don't want to be that vulnerable.
01:00:18 I would feel way too vulnerable, like drawing porn that like, I'm like, yeah, this is what
01:00:22 I'm into.
01:00:23 Okay.
01:00:24 Now I'm, now I'm posting it on the internet.
01:00:26 Yeah.
01:00:27 No fucking way.
01:00:28 I felt like that.
01:00:29 No fucking way.
01:00:30 I felt like that before.
01:00:32 Yeah.
01:00:33 But I feel that way.
01:00:35 I still kind of feel like that.
01:00:36 I feel that way.
01:00:37 I felt like that for a long time, but then the bandit got ripped off and that was easy.
01:00:41 Now, now I can't wait to share all the other crazy porn ideas, ideas I have that no one
01:00:47 has drawn before, but only I can draw unless I pay someone and fuck that.
01:00:52 I mean, yeah, I'll do it.
01:00:56 I should have just, I should have just paid someone, should have just paid someone to
01:01:01 like format my fucking book for me.
01:01:03 I shouldn't have spent like weeks and weeks working on my stupid book.
01:01:09 It seems like it's such a simple step.
01:01:11 Just organize it into a file, find a printer, but no, months go by and it's still not done.
01:01:19 You know, I got a specific complaint.
01:01:24 I mean, I really hate, I think it's going to be the case that the book will have to be,
01:01:30 you know, long, you know, like bound on the short end and it's going to be kind of long.
01:01:36 It might end up being like eight by 12.
01:01:39 And that's just too long.
01:01:40 I don't like that.
01:01:42 It's annoying.
01:01:43 Yeah, it's a flappy.
01:01:45 That's an annoying, yeah, it's an annoying flappy size for a book.
01:01:49 But like, that's what, that's the shape.
01:01:52 That's the shape of the panels, man.
01:01:54 I mean, in the Homestuck books, they have like the panels don't take up the entire,
01:02:03 like four panels don't take up the entire thing.
01:02:06 They're smaller and then they've obviously got the text underneath.
01:02:09 Yeah.
01:02:10 But then there's like the commentary right at the bottom.
01:02:14 Yeah.
01:02:15 If you had the commentary there, it would make it a taller book, I guess.
01:02:21 Yeah, but no, some pages have like, I have like a lot of commentary and some and like,
01:02:29 it just wouldn't fit.
01:02:30 Some pages have a lot of commentary and some have very little or none.
01:02:34 I could just add, I mean, I could just add space in between and at the bottom and top.
01:02:40 It's just like, that's a waste of space.
01:02:42 And that's just like making it cost more to print, like for what, like just to make it
01:02:48 taller, to make it less oblong.
01:02:53 It seems kind of stupid.
01:02:57 And yet I want, I kind of want to just because eight by 12 bound on the eight.
01:03:05 It doesn't fit on a bookshelf.
01:03:06 It's going to stick out.
01:03:08 Oh, yeah.
01:03:10 All the things I have on my, on my like cool comics shelf will be sticking out.
01:03:17 I have to put at the edge.
01:03:18 I could bind it on top, like I could make it so that you have to flip through it, like hold it sideways.
01:03:26 You know what I mean?
01:03:27 That would be so weird.
01:03:29 Yeah, it's that seems just as awkward, if not more so.
01:03:35 I'd have to like open it like a laptop.
01:03:37 Exactly.
01:03:38 Rest it on my knees.
01:03:40 Exactly.
01:03:41 Exactly.
01:03:42 So I don't know if that's a good solution.
01:03:45 I guess I could, I could make it really tall.
01:03:51 What if I had, ooh, I could have eight panels on a page.
01:04:00 I mean, if they don't end up being too small, that could work.
01:04:08 I would cut the page.
01:04:09 But then it would be 16 by 12, wouldn't it?
01:04:11 It would cut the page count in half.
01:04:14 It would be 16.
01:04:16 Yeah.
01:04:17 Oh no, it wouldn't be 12 then.
01:04:20 No, yeah, would it be?
01:04:22 Yeah, it would still be, it would still be 12 long.
01:04:25 It would be 16 by 12, or I mean, I could shrink it to eight by six.
01:04:30 That's too small.
01:04:33 It's almost like a Twitter image size sucks for books.
01:04:42 Almost.
01:04:45 What if you just squished it all so all of the images were distorted?
01:04:49 Ooh, yeah.
01:04:51 Ooh, yeah.
01:04:52 And I could like just use like the, the Morph tool and like have it set on like hard, hard
01:05:01 edge transform settings so that like.
01:05:04 Nearest neighbor.
01:05:05 Yeah, yeah.
01:05:06 Like it ends up with like all these jagged, like pixelated everywhere.
01:05:11 Yeah.
01:05:12 Thinking, that's thinking.
01:05:17 This is, this has been my week.
01:05:21 I have not, again, I have not left my house for another week has gone by.
01:05:28 So you know, that's where I'm at.
01:05:30 Just contemplating my hairline and all this stuff.
01:05:36 That's, that's how, that's how it's been for me for a while.
01:05:41 Listen, I'm not in a great place.
01:05:42 Listen, I'm not in a great place mentally.
01:05:44 All right.
01:05:45 It's what I'm trying to say.
01:05:46 It's not clear.
01:05:47 Okay.
01:05:48 If you can't pick up on, if you can't pick up on, on subtext, let me just spell it out
01:05:54 for you.
01:05:55 Okay.
01:05:56 All right.
01:05:57 All right.
01:05:59 Why is hairline the most important thing a human can have?
01:06:02 It's, why is that, why is that so like such a thing?
01:06:06 Yeah.
01:06:07 You know, scholars wonder, yeah, why is the hairline the single most important thing
01:06:11 about a person?
01:06:13 It is kind of weird how like 70% of what makes someone attractive is their hair a lot of
01:06:19 the time.
01:06:20 That's not even a joke.
01:06:21 God, I was gonna say, please tell me you're joking.
01:06:25 That's just like my estimate because like I've noticed the like.
01:06:28 Is that for you personally?
01:06:31 Well, I and I, I think other people have noticed that like the way someone wears their hair
01:06:36 like has such a huge effect on like how they look to other people.
01:06:39 Yeah.
01:06:40 Like having shitty hair can make you look like a gala and having good hair can make you
01:06:45 look fucking great.
01:06:46 It's, it's, it makes such a huge difference.
01:06:50 It does make a difference.
01:06:52 I would say for me, it's definitely not 70%.
01:06:56 I would say for me, it might make like feel like someone who is otherwise attractive,
01:07:03 the difference between them having like a really nice hair cut hairdo versus them being
01:07:09 like disheveled.
01:07:10 Their hair looks like shit.
01:07:11 Maybe like a picture of Elon Musk 25% before his hair was fixed.
01:07:17 Who?
01:07:18 Elon Musk, you've seen what it looked like before he got his hair like.
01:07:23 Yeah.
01:07:24 Yeah.
01:07:25 I mean, he looks, he looks better.
01:07:27 He looks better with the, with the hair.
01:07:29 People kept making fun of Donald Trump for his funny wig, but he would have looked worse
01:07:34 if he didn't have it.
01:07:35 That's not true.
01:07:36 That's not true.
01:07:37 I've seen him with his hair like combed back.
01:07:40 It looks fine.
01:07:41 Like he doesn't even have like a receding hairline.
01:07:43 I guess I haven't really seen him.
01:07:45 No, he actually looks fine with his hair normal.
01:07:47 Like there's no reason why he does such freak shit with it.
01:07:50 This is so funny.
01:07:55 He literally looked, literally looked older when he was like, what is he like in his 30s
01:08:00 in that first one?
01:08:02 Literally looked older with his, with his receding hairline.
01:08:07 I do like some of these, these comedy moments.
01:08:14 I miss these.
01:08:16 Okay.
01:08:17 And that one, he does look like it's like a wig or something.
01:08:22 Hmm.
01:08:23 What's that?
01:08:24 Weird.
01:08:25 Oh my God.
01:08:26 What a weirdo.
01:08:29 He truly is just a real fucking weirdo, honestly.
01:08:35 His wife just, or his ex-wife just died.
01:08:40 So we can't, we shouldn't make fun of him.
01:08:42 He's going through a hard, he's going through a hard time.
01:08:45 I forgot what I was doing.
01:08:48 What are we talking about?
01:08:51 Hair.
01:08:53 I mean, I feel like my hair looks all right when it's nice, but the hairline thing is a
01:09:04 constant like aggravator.
01:09:07 You know, because, because it's, it's not just that, oh, it's looks kind of bad.
01:09:12 It's, it's like telling of my masculinity that I have a receding hairline like that.
01:09:19 And it's like, oh, dysphoria on top of all that.
01:09:23 It's really, really gets me sometimes.
01:09:25 I have to wear hats whenever I go outside.
01:09:28 It sucks.
01:09:29 You know whose hair was fascinating to watch progress?
01:09:32 I feel like I bring this guy up like an unusual amount, but Dan Olson, his, he used.
01:09:41 Oh yeah.
01:09:42 Yeah.
01:09:43 He used to do a thing with it where like, you could kind of tell that it was thinning,
01:09:47 but he sort of wore it over his forehead in a kind of like, almost like deliberately
01:09:53 shitty way.
01:09:55 And I think, I don't know, there was a period there where it was like, it doesn't look good.
01:10:01 Like you're, like you're, you're kind of clearly sort of trying to do something with it that
01:10:06 like you don't have enough there to do that with.
01:10:09 And then at some point he just, at some point he just made the switch, the switch flipped
01:10:15 and he, he went from a disheveled looking, you know, youngish guy to a pretty, pretty
01:10:25 like well put together a middle aged man when he shaved his head and beard went white and
01:10:35 you know.
01:10:37 Yeah.
01:10:38 I mean, it's a good look for him.
01:10:39 I would say he overall looks better.
01:10:41 Yeah.
01:10:43 Which is what makes me like, maybe I should just, maybe is it, is it time?
01:10:47 When will I have to take the plunge?
01:10:49 The day will come.
01:10:51 Whatever you do, don't, don't do a fucking comb over like that one voicemailer suggested
01:10:55 like a few weeks ago.
01:10:57 No.
01:10:58 Comb over is part of a devil.
01:10:59 I would, you gotta, you gotta grow your hair right at the back of your neck really long
01:11:03 and then come all the way over.
01:11:05 I would never want to like wear my hair or anything in a way that's like I'm like trying
01:11:11 to disguise something.
01:11:13 Like I brush my hair to the side now and it's just, that's just how I do it and it's not
01:11:18 like, I don't know.
01:11:20 I'm not, yeah, I wouldn't, I would never do a comb over.
01:11:23 That's just stupid.
01:11:24 I would just, just shave it at that point in my opinion.
01:11:27 Yeah.
01:11:28 In my opinion, I agree too.
01:11:30 Yeah.
01:11:32 I just, just when, when do I, when do I pull a Dan?
01:11:37 Am I there yet?
01:11:38 I don't know.
01:11:39 One of the, one day.
01:11:41 Is it today?
01:11:43 It's the sort of the sort of Damocles.
01:11:44 The sort of Damocles is dangling.
01:11:46 The sort of Danocles.
01:11:48 Ah, yes.
01:11:49 Ah, yes.
01:11:50 Ah, yes.
01:11:53 That's all, that's it.
01:11:54 That the scissors of Damocles or the razor of Damocles.
01:11:59 Yeah.
01:12:00 Because you're cutting your hair.
01:12:01 Right.
01:12:02 I lost.
01:12:03 Yeah.
01:12:04 You know what, you know what?
01:12:05 On a more, on a more exciting hair related, this is very exciting.
01:12:09 The stuff we talk about on this podcast is like a thrilling to our audience.
01:12:13 I gotta say, I have a beard again.
01:12:16 I have like a real beard, which like I have not had one since Radcon 2 basically.
01:12:21 Oh, comb the beard up over your hair.
01:12:24 I have like an actual like full beard again and it feels great and I feel like a more
01:12:29 complete human for that.
01:12:31 So I got that going for me.
01:12:35 Yeah.
01:12:36 Even though, even though it is, even though it is kind of white on the, on the near the
01:12:42 ears, but like, that's fine.
01:12:44 I don't really mind it.
01:12:46 Is it, is it like lumberjack size the same as the first TBAP Q&A?
01:12:51 It's not that big.
01:12:53 It's not, it's not that length yet, but like it's getting there.
01:12:56 Maybe in another two months or something.
01:12:59 Yeah.
01:13:01 I remember like I, it's bizarre, but like around TBAP time, maybe like a little before
01:13:08 TBAP or in the very early days of TBAP, I had like a long beard.
01:13:12 I had like, like it was like, it must have been like seven or eight inches long.
01:13:18 Uh, very strange, very strange to think that ever.
01:13:22 Yeah.
01:13:23 Uh, only time I ever did that in my life.
01:13:26 Uh, maybe I'll just do it again.
01:13:29 Maybe I'll just freaking do it again.
01:13:32 I have, I have managed to avoid, my, my trick or telemania has been, uh, I have managed
01:13:38 it, uh, in a way that has, uh, allowed my beard to be normal more or less.
01:13:46 Uh, uh, and that's an accomplishment for me.
01:13:51 It's very difficult.
01:13:53 So it's kind of strange that I have managed that these days when I am feeling so such despair.
01:14:04 Uh, uh, but I guess, you know, that's just, uh, that's life.
01:14:10 That's the way the beard crumbles.
01:14:12 That's true.
01:14:13 That's true.
01:14:14 Speaking of beard crumbling, um, my, my laser hair removal thing that I've been doing.
01:14:20 Yeah.
01:14:21 To get rid of my facial hair forever.
01:14:23 Yeah.
01:14:24 Um, it has progressed to a point where, uh, the last session, I had a session recently,
01:14:31 but before that, um, there was, uh, there was a problem after I got home from America,
01:14:39 I had gained a bit of a tan because we went to the beach one day.
01:14:42 Right.
01:14:43 And they said, Oh, we can't do it.
01:14:46 Yeah.
01:14:47 You mentioned, uh, you mentioned that.
01:14:49 So.
01:14:50 Oh, very strange.
01:14:51 That's been, that was, that was a thing.
01:14:54 Yeah.
01:14:55 And now I've done it, but in the interim, I had to wait an additional six weeks and my
01:15:01 beard barely grew back at all in that entire time.
01:15:05 And I, I, I've always had like an extremely fast growing beard, um, compared to people
01:15:12 my age or the round the age that I started growing it.
01:15:15 Um, so it was really cool to see that after six weeks, it was like very faint.
01:15:21 Yeah.
01:15:22 Yeah.
01:15:23 Like if you didn't look at it, you probably didn't notice.
01:15:25 Is it, is it like, okay, did it grow back?
01:15:28 Like just, there were fewer hairs.
01:15:30 Like there just weren't many hairs or was it like, they were like, like, like the hair
01:15:35 on your arm, like they're finer and, and like softer and thinner.
01:15:38 No, no, no.
01:15:39 There were just fewer hairs.
01:15:40 Yeah.
01:15:41 Um, round my cheeks, there's nothing.
01:15:43 Um, on my chin is where a lot of it is and on my lips, uh, above and below my lips is
01:15:48 where.
01:15:49 On, on your lips.
01:15:50 Yes.
01:15:51 Glowing directly out of the lips.
01:15:53 Yeah.
01:15:54 The lipstick's a nightmare.
01:15:56 Um, but.
01:15:57 I gotta shave my lips before I apply lipstick every single time.
01:16:03 Um, but yeah, it's like, there's like a countable number of hairs, probably not actually countable,
01:16:11 but like it's so stark from the way it used to be.
01:16:16 It's, it's, it's really gratifying.
01:16:19 I like it.
01:16:20 I like looking at it.
01:16:21 I like, I like, I don't like looking at it because I can still see that there is hair
01:16:25 there, but I like knowing that it has been such a long time and I don't have a beard that
01:16:30 goes like, like protrude from my chin.
01:16:33 I don't have a moustache that goes into my mouth.
01:16:36 You know, you know, moustache gets too long.
01:16:40 Yeah.
01:16:41 Doesn't happen anymore.
01:16:44 Yeah.
01:16:45 Yeah.
01:16:46 The hairs were like the length, like about half a millimeter length maximum.
01:16:53 My, I, my moustache is a bit shorter than the rest of my beard because I did, I did pull
01:16:59 out like a part, not a lot, but like a little like section of my moustache.
01:17:03 And I was like, shit, shit, shit.
01:17:05 Uh, so I avoided plucking at it for a while and it has grown back and it's like few.
01:17:11 Okay.
01:17:12 It's complete again.
01:17:13 I must, I must never again.
01:17:15 I must never again do that.
01:17:17 Uh, so, uh, it's back, but it's just shorter because it started growing later, basically.
01:17:24 Uh, but it looks deliberate.
01:17:26 It doesn't look fucked up.
01:17:27 I swear it doesn't look fucked up.
01:17:29 I look normal.
01:17:30 I look normal.
01:17:33 I say screaming into the mirror.
01:17:36 Thank you.
01:17:37 Someone, someone finally, someone believes it.
01:17:40 I believe it.
01:17:41 You know, I went to a hairdresser for the first time in like two years.
01:17:46 Oh yeah.
01:17:47 Recently.
01:17:48 Since COVID.
01:17:50 Yeah.
01:17:51 When COVID started, I just said, fuck it.
01:17:53 I'm just going to like shave my head once every six months.
01:17:55 That's what I was doing.
01:17:57 Yeah.
01:17:58 I mean, um, makes sense.
01:18:01 Yeah.
01:18:02 The way my hair grew back looked really weird.
01:18:03 I look like a freaky, freakazoid.
01:18:06 How's, how so?
01:18:09 I don't know.
01:18:10 It's just like, it looks like I was wearing like a fucking, like a helmet, like a fucking
01:18:13 Minecraft helmet.
01:18:14 Like you just grew back as like a shapeless like orb.
01:18:18 Well, well, it's like, you know, like my, my fringe is, you know, was like just above
01:18:24 my eyes.
01:18:25 And then right before it hits my ears, the hair just drops down like four more inches
01:18:29 and then just goes around the back.
01:18:31 Um, so my, my face is like in this fucking square window.
01:18:35 Um, oh, cause it was like long on the sides.
01:18:38 So it like kind of, yeah.
01:18:39 Yeah.
01:18:40 Yeah.
01:18:41 Cause I have like a straight, I have a straight hairline on them by my ear as it just goes
01:18:43 right down.
01:18:44 Yeah.
01:18:45 And it was really weird.
01:18:46 I went to a hairdresser and I, and I thought, you know, I'm actually going to tell them,
01:18:51 I'm actually going to tell them to aim for style for the first time in my life.
01:18:54 Cause I would always just walk in there and be like, I don't know, just take like half
01:18:58 the length off, I guess.
01:19:00 And they would just do whatever the fuck.
01:19:02 And my hair slowly got like really bad.
01:19:04 Uh, but this time I'm like, I don't know, vaguely just shape it vaguely so that like,
01:19:12 if I just sort of brush it, it'll sort of sit on my face the way like emo hair from
01:19:17 like the late 2000s would, but without all the product.
01:19:20 It's a good, it's a good style.
01:19:22 Yeah.
01:19:23 Yeah.
01:19:24 And she was like, I got you a fan.
01:19:25 And then she, uh, shaped it.
01:19:27 She didn't take any line call, but she just shaped it and it looks good.
01:19:29 I feel like it looked good.
01:19:30 I feel like it looked better than I have.
01:19:32 Wait, that's how it looks now?
01:19:34 Yeah.
01:19:35 That's how I look now.
01:19:36 And I think I look better than I have in a long fucking time.
01:19:39 Yeah.
01:19:40 Um, even pre-cut.
01:19:41 I don't, well, I can't compare to how you looked pre haircut, but, uh, looking good.
01:19:47 Looking good, man.
01:19:48 I, I should probably find it a pre haircut image.
01:19:52 Actually, I definitely can.
01:19:54 You just re-posed the Donald Trump image.
01:19:57 This is what I looked like before.
01:19:59 Oh, I, I, let me go for my 2019 folder.
01:20:02 Uh, I, uh, I might go, I, I, I cut my own hair, but I might go to like, uh, a stylist
01:20:10 or something to get a real haircut maybe before I am ready to film that, uh, that
01:20:16 video project that I've put off for the book for the moment.
01:20:21 Uh, although I'm, I don't know.
01:20:25 I don't know, it makes me nervous.
01:20:28 Sometimes I get a haircut and I hate how it looks.
01:20:31 Sometimes I feel like, uh, when I just kind of let the hair do whatever it wants, I just
01:20:37 end up feeling like more comfortable with it.
01:20:40 Like I'm just like, eh, it's fine.
01:20:41 It is what it is.
01:20:42 But then if I get a haircut and it's bad, I'm like, it's, it's, it's not, it's bad,
01:20:50 but it's like deliberately bad.
01:20:52 Like it's like, it feels worse cause like, okay, but it's like, I don't like how it was
01:20:57 made to be.
01:20:58 If it, if it just looked bad by accident, I could just be like, eh, well, I didn't even
01:21:02 try.
01:21:03 Eh, it's just how it grows.
01:21:05 Hey, you were in the broop shirt.
01:21:08 Yeah, it is.
01:21:09 Let me see.
01:21:10 That was like three years ago.
01:21:12 That shirt is in very, very bad condition now.
01:21:14 It was already starting to get in bad condition then.
01:21:17 You should probably get a new one.
01:21:19 You looked fine.
01:21:21 It's faded.
01:21:22 You looked fine.
01:21:23 The white is gray.
01:21:25 It's full of holes.
01:21:26 Oh, you're talking about me.
01:21:28 Yeah.
01:21:29 I mean, I, my hair was like really poofy on the front.
01:21:32 So like at the front of my head, above my forehead, my hair like jutted out like two inches forward
01:21:37 in this like weird round like bulb.
01:21:40 Which is not super apparent in that screenshot, but I don't know.
01:21:47 It was odd as I, I don't know, I look better now and I'm going to be even more better because
01:21:54 I'm going to keep growing it for a bit.
01:21:57 I'll be sexy boy, sexy oblivion is coming back.
01:22:02 He is.
01:22:03 Did I, did I mention that the last time I saw my dad, he told me he was going to grow
01:22:07 a ponytail.
01:22:08 I, I vaguely remember that.
01:22:11 I just think that's so funny.
01:22:13 He called himself an old hippie.
01:22:15 He's like, he was like, eh, I'm an old hippie.
01:22:17 I might as well grow a ponytail.
01:22:19 I was like, yeah, yeah, cool.
01:22:22 I should, I should go, I should go sailing with him.
01:22:26 I haven't gone sailing in like 10 years, but I think he wants me to go sailing with him
01:22:30 sometime and like I should do that before the summer is over, maybe sometime next month
01:22:36 before puts the boat away.
01:22:40 So you have like a sailboat.
01:22:42 Him, him and his friend co-own a sailboat together.
01:22:48 Yeah.
01:22:49 It's their, it's their thing.
01:22:51 It's their, it's their hobby.
01:22:53 They love it.
01:22:54 They love, they love that freaking boat, man.
01:22:56 They're just all about it.
01:22:58 More than you.
01:23:00 I don't like boating, but you know, whatever.
01:23:05 It's not, it's about.
01:23:06 The ocean will kill you.
01:23:08 Yeah, I know.
01:23:09 Yes, I know.
01:23:10 That's why I don't like it.
01:23:13 Exactly.
01:23:14 Exactly.
01:23:15 I'm terrified of it.
01:23:17 Boats are cool until you're on one.
01:23:20 I remember being on like, on like holiday once somewhere and it was like, oh, this wooden
01:23:26 like pirate ship kind of looking boat is going to like take us on a tour around the rocks.
01:23:31 We're going to see the rocks, but it was like a real boat.
01:23:35 It went up and down and I felt sick.
01:23:38 What?
01:23:39 I thought it was going to be okay, but I'm going to throw up.
01:23:42 I think it's probably scarier for me to contemplate than it would be to, to actually go out and
01:23:50 do that.
01:23:51 Like I'm, I feel like it'll be fine.
01:23:53 Just thinking about it.
01:23:54 I'm like, God, on the sea.
01:23:56 I'll drown.
01:23:58 Uh, you know, I'll be eaten whole by a, by a lurker fish.
01:24:04 Oh.
01:24:05 Drowning in footwear.
01:24:07 Yeah.
01:24:08 What?
01:24:09 No, that was a give and take.
01:24:11 That was a hypocrite.
01:24:13 Yeah.
01:24:14 You remember Jack and Daxter?
01:24:16 Yes.
01:24:17 That's what I was, that's what, yeah.
01:24:19 Yeah.
01:24:20 I'm going to, no, no father of you.
01:24:23 Don't, I don't want to be thrown into the sea.
01:24:25 Yes.
01:24:26 Yes.
01:24:27 Classic.
01:24:28 I was, I was, I think I was calling like, no, I wanted, I don't want to go fishing.
01:24:34 Yes.
01:24:35 This was Jack and Daxter.
01:24:37 I'll be eaten whole.
01:24:39 God, I like some of my videos.
01:24:46 They're good.
01:24:47 I also like some of your videos.
01:24:50 It's a shame making videos so strange now.
01:24:54 Now that I have a big brain, I don't feel the compulsion to just talk about things.
01:24:59 I think my brain is small and stupid.
01:25:05 You think you have a big brain now?
01:25:07 You think your brain's gotten bigger?
01:25:08 I don't feel, I don't feel that way at all.
01:25:10 I feel, all right.
01:25:11 What I feel is that my, my, having seen so many good analysis videos, I feel like I can't
01:25:19 just make a video and just be happy with whatever I come up with because I need it to be worth
01:25:29 something to the larger gaming analysis scene.
01:25:34 Yeah.
01:25:35 Like I don't, I don't want to talk about a game that somebody's already done an amazing
01:25:38 video on.
01:25:39 Yeah.
01:25:40 Every other game reviewer does a retrospective on some other thing.
01:25:45 And even though the retrospective has been done by 70 other people, I don't feel like I
01:25:50 would benefit the world by doing my own, even though people would probably like it.
01:25:55 Cause like if the nostalgia chick reviews, reviews Good Burger, then the, then the nostalgia
01:26:02 critic can't review Good Burger.
01:26:04 So like only one of them can do it.
01:26:07 Ironically, yes.
01:26:10 And Good Burger is a classic.
01:26:12 And we, we, this is like highly contested.
01:26:16 Obviously.
01:26:17 The rights to Good Burger.
01:26:18 The rights to discuss Good Burger.
01:26:20 Obviously there's like, um, there's no like dibsies on, on a review.
01:26:24 If somebody made a review of a game, I actually, I actually would do this.
01:26:29 I would see if, and somebody had made a video on a game like Rayman one.
01:26:33 And I was like, ah, these videos suck.
01:26:35 I can, I, I'll do that.
01:26:37 And I'll do that video.
01:26:38 And then I did.
01:26:39 No.
01:26:40 But it's, it's just sort of like now that I've seen so many good, like really in depth
01:26:45 videos, I feel like I want to be smart when I make it.
01:26:49 I don't just, I want to be like bringing something new to the table.
01:26:52 I want to be a big, the big Joel of like, um, video game analysis.
01:26:57 I want to be saying something while I review the game.
01:27:01 Yeah.
01:27:02 I know what you mean.
01:27:05 And I have, I feel the same way.
01:27:09 Like, do you feel like if you're not, like if you're not, if you're not making something
01:27:15 that's like amazing, you're just like, why, why bother?
01:27:18 Like, is that what you're saying?
01:27:20 Kinda.
01:27:21 I mean, when it comes to videos for sure, I feel like I, I have that compulsion with
01:27:27 comics and drawings as well.
01:27:29 But I, I don't feel quite so bad about making what I currently make, which is good.
01:27:36 But like, I don't know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say anything I've made so far as a masterpiece,
01:27:43 even though there's good parts to them.
01:27:45 I, um, I think I'm a little, I'm pleased to announce that my, the video thing that I'm
01:27:55 currently, is currently on hold is, it's, I think it's, it's the only thing, it's the
01:28:02 only thing like it.
01:28:03 There are like adjacent things about like similar topics, but there's nothing, there's
01:28:10 nothing like exactly the idea that I'm, that I'm working on.
01:28:14 So like that's good.
01:28:15 But that's like kind of stupid because like even if there was, like it wouldn't matter.
01:28:20 Like it really should be fine if there was, if someone else had already done a similar
01:28:25 thing.
01:28:26 That shouldn't stop me.
01:28:27 But I think it would.
01:28:28 Uh.
01:28:29 Yeah.
01:28:30 Yeah.
01:28:31 I've had ideas, but then I, I, for, for little things, like I kind of wanted to like understand
01:28:39 all of the World of Warcraft lore from the very beginning of time to presently.
01:28:45 Um, and I would have taken a lot of research and I would put it all in a video.
01:28:50 But of course, World of Warcraft is gigantic.
01:28:53 There are already people who have entire channels dedicated to documenting World of Warcraft
01:28:58 lore and they do it really in an entertaining way with animations and voiceovers and I'm
01:29:04 like, okay, well, I mean, why would I spend all that time researching?
01:29:08 But is there like something that was subpar compared to what was already around?
01:29:14 But maybe they're doing subpar because they're not funny.
01:29:17 Yeah, I guess.
01:29:18 They are funny.
01:29:19 You would need.
01:29:20 I mean, I guess you would need to find an angle to it that would like, it's like, okay,
01:29:27 but has anyone does it like this?
01:29:30 Like has anyone done it in this way?
01:29:32 Like, like I said, the thing that I'm doing, other people have made videos about similar
01:29:37 things, but no one has done it in the format that I am planning to do it.
01:29:43 So I'm like, that's, that's good.
01:29:45 Interpretive dance.
01:29:46 Yeah, exactly.
01:29:48 Uh, like that's, that's good enough.
01:29:52 You know, I mean, maybe, uh, yeah, maybe other people make like World of Warcraft lore videos,
01:29:58 but nobody has like organized it into like a comprehensive, uh, I don't know, uh, the
01:30:06 fucking eight hour long, uh, yeah, spoken word poem about it.
01:30:15 All right, get right on that.
01:30:17 Yeah.
01:30:18 That's, that's an untapped market.
01:30:21 No, nobody's just dryly spoken the lore, uh, while they play, um, Counter-Strike in the
01:30:29 background.
01:30:30 I think that that's an untapped market.
01:30:33 Yeah.
01:30:34 I want heavy interruptions.
01:30:35 You're like, oh, wait, wait, I gotta wait.
01:30:38 Hang on.
01:30:39 Give me a minute.
01:30:40 Okay.
01:30:41 Yes.
01:30:42 Double kill.
01:30:43 Double kill.
01:30:44 Okay.
01:30:45 So anyway, uh, so anyway, Thrall is green.
01:30:47 Oh, fuck.
01:30:48 Oh, fuck.
01:30:49 Oh, I said campers, man.
01:30:51 Oh, bullshit.
01:30:52 Okay.
01:30:53 So anyway, uh, uh, the horde is good and the alliance is bad.
01:30:57 Huh?
01:30:58 Um, yeah.
01:30:59 Yeah.
01:31:00 So you should Thrall go to the mall.
01:31:04 Thrall.
01:31:05 Thrall plays Super Smash Bros.
01:31:07 Cool.
01:31:08 Brawl.
01:31:09 Uh, I don't know.
01:31:10 I don't know anything about anything about the World of Warcraft lore.
01:31:14 I didn't even know it when I was playing it.
01:31:17 Uh, I knew that Arthas was bad.
01:31:19 What, uh, race were you?
01:31:22 Uh, my main was a troll.
01:31:26 So did you, you got like the, when you made your character, there's like the cutscene
01:31:30 that zooms around and ends on your character.
01:31:33 And there's like a narrator saying stuff about your, your kind.
01:31:37 What, what's the trolls up to?
01:31:40 I mean, I, I, not, not much.
01:31:43 They're kind of just, you know, they sort of have their like witch doctor stuff and
01:31:48 like, you know, they're in the horde.
01:31:51 They're allied with the orcs and like, that's it.
01:31:55 You got it.
01:31:56 I'm pretty sure there's just not that much else too.
01:31:58 I remember the, the Draenei kind of had, the Draenei had like their own, uh, they were
01:32:06 like alien.
01:32:07 I thought the Draenei were really cool.
01:32:09 And then I, um, crash landed on the planet because they were fleeing the Burning Legion
01:32:14 who were also in space.
01:32:16 Yeah.
01:32:17 And they're like, oh man, I love the dry.
01:32:20 I, uh, I, how like they're, I didn't realize it at first, but like they look exactly like
01:32:27 demons.
01:32:28 And like they are demons.
01:32:30 Like they're the same creature.
01:32:32 It's just those are like the evil version of what was originally these like these peaceful
01:32:37 like blue people.
01:32:38 They're peaceful blue people.
01:32:40 They got like, when the Burning Legion conquers a planet, um, they enslave the race and they
01:32:46 turn them into demons.
01:32:47 And then all the different demon enemies you see in World of Warcraft are different races
01:32:52 of different things that have been conquered over the galaxy.
01:32:55 And we see the Draenei and it's like, oh, well, they're not all like.
01:32:59 I saw, I saw one of those demons and I was like, huh, you know, now that I think about
01:33:03 it, and I kind of do just sort of look like, you know, regular old like hoof footed, like
01:33:08 Satan demons, just blue.
01:33:10 Oh yeah.
01:33:12 Neat.
01:33:13 Uh.
01:33:14 Yes.
01:33:15 Kind of like.
01:33:16 So much richness.
01:33:17 There's so much layer.
01:33:21 Hmm.
01:33:22 Someone should make.
01:33:23 So much onion.
01:33:24 There's so much content to be mine for like an eight hour long YouTube video that people
01:33:29 post around like, oh my God, I can't believe somebody made an eight hour long video explaining
01:33:33 the lore.
01:33:34 Oh my God.
01:33:35 Who would do that?
01:33:36 Haha.
01:33:37 Let's make clickbait articles about it.
01:33:39 Do people make clickbait articles now about those?
01:33:43 Yeah.
01:33:44 Like, uh, when Quinton reviews put out the fucking like seven hour long victorious review, just
01:33:50 like, just the fact that he did that, like fucking news outlets were making like shitty
01:33:56 non-articles about like, some guy made a seven hour video discussing every episode of victorious
01:34:04 lull and just got a ton of exposure from that.
01:34:08 Just from the fact of being like a very stupid endeavor that someone like fully, fully executed.
01:34:15 I mean, it's playing the meta.
01:34:18 He knows how stupid that looks.
01:34:20 Yeah.
01:34:21 Absolutely.
01:34:23 It's just, it's, it's, it was objectively a smart thing to do because of how stupid it
01:34:30 is.
01:34:31 You need to make a 100 hour video talking about the lore.
01:34:34 Oh, but I, I'd lose my voice.
01:34:39 Uh, I don't know exactly how long this video project that I am working on is going to be.
01:34:48 I am considering ways that I could make it, ways that I could extend the length and wondering
01:34:55 like, can, can I make it absurdly long, like stupidly long?
01:35:01 And, and if so, should I do that?
01:35:03 Uh, I am taking it under consideration.
01:35:08 You should obviously not pad it because like a super long video with a lot of fluff would
01:35:14 make me click away.
01:35:15 No.
01:35:16 But I mean, I wouldn't want to pad it.
01:35:20 Don't, don't like leave things out.
01:35:22 If you want it to be.
01:35:24 No, I'm thinking, I'm thinking, like comprehensive and just allow it to be whatever length it
01:35:30 is.
01:35:31 Yeah.
01:35:32 I'm wondering like how long can I, can I make it by just like being as comprehensive as
01:35:37 possible and like how much.
01:35:40 Yeah.
01:35:41 And I don't know.
01:35:42 I genuinely don't know.
01:35:45 I think that there's two ways to approach it.
01:35:48 There's like the, the cliffs notes of the most interesting parts, which is going to be
01:35:56 like, you know, depending on what the subject is, would be a shorter video, but a longer
01:36:03 video people would just put on and listen to.
01:36:08 Yeah.
01:36:09 And the droning is like relaxing.
01:36:12 So if it's like all, if it's really interesting stuff, I would say try to make it a shorter
01:36:20 video.
01:36:21 But if it's a lot of stuff that is just sort of odd that they have all that information
01:36:26 about them, then you would go for a longer video because it's not like, you know, imagine
01:36:32 if you're like trying to sleep and you got this video playing.
01:36:36 You want it to be like the same sort of interestingness throughout.
01:36:42 I, I, I'm just going to have to, going to have to see, I'm going to have to see how long
01:36:49 it ends up being.
01:36:51 I'm, and I'm going to have, I think I'm inclined to try and like rush past things and like
01:36:57 keep things short and concise, but I think I'm going to like maybe try and maybe try
01:37:04 and like resist that urge that I have and like not like force it to be shorter than
01:37:11 like maybe it needs to be.
01:37:13 Like if it, if it's long, like let it, like if it needs to be long, let it be long is
01:37:19 kind of my thinking about it.
01:37:22 Yeah.
01:37:23 Because people like long videos.
01:37:24 The long videos do well and there's really no reason to not do that.
01:37:30 I wish, I wish that my lectures had been longer.
01:37:34 It would only be better, they would only be better for having been longer, I think.
01:37:42 I agree.
01:37:43 Yeah.
01:37:44 It's funny.
01:37:45 I saw a long video recently.
01:37:47 Yeah.
01:37:48 I'll let you finish first.
01:37:49 Oh, I was just going to say, I remember like people have commented on like how long they
01:37:54 are.
01:37:55 And like looking back, like, yeah, those, like the Sonata lecture came out in an era before
01:37:59 you know, people making seven hour retrospectives about Pokemon Ruby, 12 hour long retrospectives
01:38:06 about, you know, Skyrim, a seven hour long retrospectives about victorious, you know,
01:38:12 compared to all that, like two hours, 10 minutes is nothing.
01:38:17 It's funny in hindsight.
01:38:20 I've watched a long video.
01:38:21 I watched a, I think it was, I don't know.
01:38:27 I think it was, oh God, what was it?
01:38:30 I watched like an eight hour long video yesterday.
01:38:33 I just put it on like all day.
01:38:35 It was a, well, I don't remember.
01:38:38 And I'll think, I'm probably, it'll come to me.
01:38:41 Was it a no cold world travest?
01:38:44 No.
01:38:45 No.
01:38:46 I don't know.
01:38:51 I don't know.
01:38:54 Oh, was it Pokemon?
01:38:58 I, listen, we, I don't, I don't remember.
01:39:01 I will probably remember at some point.
01:39:03 We don't have to dwell on it.
01:39:06 Were you going to say oblivion?
01:39:08 I was going to say, I saw, I got a video recommended to me that reminded me of a thing, a mini rant
01:39:16 perhaps.
01:39:17 But yeah, it was like a long video.
01:39:19 It was like the first 100 levels of the back rooms explained.
01:39:23 And I'm like, the back rooms, I know that mean, what do they mean levels?
01:39:27 I thought it was just, thought it was just yellow, yellow empty office building.
01:39:33 You know what the back rooms is, right?
01:39:35 Yeah.
01:39:36 No.
01:39:37 It's, all right, you may have seen this.
01:39:39 It's like based on liminal spaces.
01:39:42 There's like a, I think there was a video series or just a short film made of the
01:39:48 back rooms, which is like a, a dingy office building with uncanny architecture and like
01:39:58 weird hallways and it doesn't make sense.
01:40:01 And it goes on and on forever.
01:40:03 Yeah.
01:40:04 It's like the sense of a liminal space, but a video of it.
01:40:08 But then there was a monster and monsters scary.
01:40:12 That does sound scary.
01:40:14 I think that would scare me a lot.
01:40:17 Yeah.
01:40:18 Well, I think nowadays there's like at least 10 or 20 people who are making back rooms
01:40:23 videos that are actually, for the most part, a lot of the ones I've seen are very, very
01:40:27 well made.
01:40:28 It's not a genre video.
01:40:30 People really like this idea of like the, the, the sort of the feeling of being a kid
01:40:39 and lost in some, in your parents like office building or like in a place where there's
01:40:45 no people around and it's just like oppressive fluorescent lights and, and it's just sort
01:40:52 of unnerving that it's like, cause like the idea is that you're there and there's no,
01:40:58 like you just black out and you wake up there and there's no way out and you're just trapped
01:41:04 there forever.
01:41:05 Yeah.
01:41:06 And that's a, that's an appealing prospect.
01:41:09 For a horror setting.
01:41:11 Yeah.
01:41:12 For a horror setting, it's like this infinite space that just kind of looks the same, but
01:41:16 like, it doesn't really make sense and it just stretches on forever and you're just kind
01:41:19 of stuck there.
01:41:22 You know, so yeah, like I was watching that video and the video has to go through like
01:41:27 a hundred like versions of this.
01:41:29 So like there's like one that's an office building.
01:41:31 There's one that's like a basement full of pipes that goes on forever.
01:41:34 There's one that's like a hotel lobby that goes on forever, et cetera.
01:41:38 And the video was sort of like, I guess he wanted to be concise.
01:41:43 Like he didn't really spend a lot of time on each one.
01:41:45 The video was only an hour long to talk about a hundred things.
01:41:49 So I feel like that could have been a video that could have benefited from its length.
01:41:53 But the other thing that I was thinking about watching it, it's not directly related to
01:41:58 this conversation is I kind of, I kind of hate how like this cool idea of just like an infinite
01:42:04 space that goes on forever.
01:42:06 Like everyone's like, yeah, but where's the monster?
01:42:09 Where's this scary stick figure that jumps out at you and goes, blah, we need like ten
01:42:14 pages of lore and there has to be a bunch of monsters and they come in different types
01:42:17 and they have these rules.
01:42:18 And if you you blink three times and then like it's just all this.
01:42:21 Well, that's I mean, that's just that's just good horror writing.
01:42:24 You know, it needs you need to have like a really clear explanation of like what everything
01:42:28 is.
01:42:29 You need to be able to like put it on a spreadsheet.
01:42:33 They overcomplicate everything.
01:42:36 It's it I get the compulsion.
01:42:38 If you can't I mean it's a mystery.
01:42:40 I want to figure it out.
01:42:41 I want to figure it out.
01:42:42 But like people that just would just make up an idea for like something and then people
01:42:47 like, oh, yeah, that's probably that's that's a good idea.
01:42:50 So that's now canon in our fan and world.
01:42:53 If there isn't a well understood explanation for what the monster is and its exact capabilities
01:42:58 and what sort of taxonomy and hierarchy it exists within, then like, what are we going
01:43:03 to make a wiki about?
01:43:04 Yeah.
01:43:05 I I didn't like the the monster.
01:43:08 I I didn't realize how much the monster detracts from the feeling.
01:43:14 I always like the liminal spaces posts.
01:43:17 They're like, ah, that's it's just it's an odd feeling to see something that is a liminal
01:43:23 space because it just it's it's like nostalgic but like I'm nerving.
01:43:30 And like the it's still and it's like, what do I do here?
01:43:40 But the the back rooms with the monsters.
01:43:43 It just sort of becomes like, oh, no, you're there's a minotaur in this maze and he's going
01:43:49 to get you.
01:43:50 These rooms would be so awesome to be in with like people.
01:43:55 Yeah.
01:43:56 Yeah.
01:43:57 So what I'm posting here is a offshoot of the back rooms called the pool rooms.
01:44:02 Actually, that descending staircase into the abyss is actually scary.
01:44:07 I don't like that one.
01:44:09 Yeah.
01:44:10 Yeah, these are great.
01:44:13 The pool rooms is like the better version of the back rooms for me.
01:44:16 And the main thing like some people have made videos where like spooky spooky monster jumps
01:44:21 out of the pool.
01:44:22 But like there was one animation I saw that's really well done.
01:44:26 I'm going to link it by what's his name like Matt something hold on.
01:44:33 I think the the thing that's just it's really captivating is is the the apparent stillness
01:44:42 like if you're standing here and you're looking at this there's nobody around you can keep
01:44:47 walking you can look around but like there's no like sense of urgency.
01:44:52 I feel like the sense of urgency is contrary to what the liminal space images like bring
01:45:00 to the table.
01:45:03 It's like if you had a doom level in a little more space back rooms level is like or a quake
01:45:09 level.
01:45:10 It'd be fun but it would just be a quake level.
01:45:13 Oh God.
01:45:14 Yeah.
01:45:15 Although I would like that.
01:45:16 Now they say it.
01:45:19 This is like even knowing that like there's no like jump scare and this like it's too
01:45:25 tense for me to watch.
01:45:27 I know it's really well done though.
01:45:30 Like this is all just an animation.
01:45:33 I mean you think they built all of us for real.
01:45:37 Oh it's animated.
01:45:40 Yeah.
01:45:41 I guess that makes sense is the camera motion.
01:45:47 Yeah.
01:45:48 The found footage but like the footage is so fucking weird.
01:45:52 I mean where are they.
01:45:54 I mean I yeah so I mean some of these rooms seem like they might exist in some capacity
01:46:00 somewhere but like not a whole complex like this yeah.
01:46:06 It's a feeling of like going into an abandoned building and not being sure if there's like
01:46:11 somebody is going to tell you to get out of here.
01:46:15 Yeah.
01:46:17 You're just like you know it's real life so real life doesn't have random encounters
01:46:24 so like there's no monsters going to come.
01:46:26 It would actually be really man I don't know.
01:46:31 I don't know what would scare me more like the prospect out of this.
01:46:35 There's like if I was here in one of these pool room places it would be scary to be
01:46:41 all alone and think like I'm the only one here like there's like nothing.
01:46:49 This just goes on forever and ever and I'm the only one and like there's nothing else.
01:46:54 It's just an expanse but it's also scary to think like what if someone did show up.
01:47:00 Like what if what if there was someone like I don't know I would feel like.
01:47:07 Are they going to get me or are they going to do something like.
01:47:12 I'm going to have sex with me or what's going to happen.
01:47:15 I would feel like if someone finds me if someone finds me here it's like they're going to think
01:47:20 I'm not supposed to be here they're going to do something to me.
01:47:23 Yeah.
01:47:24 It's the sense of that that possibility because you don't know anything about this place.
01:47:30 It's not like oh in 5am the janitor will come and open up.
01:47:35 It's like you have no idea what the hell is going on.
01:47:38 The fear comes from not seeing anything.
01:47:42 Not actually seeing a monster running after you.
01:47:45 And but assuming that it could could be there.
01:47:49 I remember good fucking atmosphere.
01:47:53 It's it's thick the atmosphere is thick.
01:47:57 By the way I remembered the long video I watched it was the new LS mark ranking every
01:48:02 SpongeBob SquarePants episode ever seven hours.
01:48:06 It's good.
01:48:07 Oh I think I saw that and recommended.
01:48:10 I had I have what I have watched the one he did it with the Simpsons he did it with family guy.
01:48:15 I watched both.
01:48:16 Oh yes that guy.
01:48:17 I haven't watched any of those.
01:48:19 It's something about.
01:48:21 His avatar.
01:48:22 No well that but also just the the idea of like ranking every episode of.
01:48:30 I don't know.
01:48:31 I I feel like I can't imagine game.
01:48:35 I'm down for it.
01:48:36 Like yeah.
01:48:37 All right.
01:48:38 Well I I mean you can you can tell me then do they get into an acceptable or satisfying
01:48:46 level of depth with their regards regards their opinion on each episode.
01:48:50 It or do they like say yeah this one was pretty good.
01:48:54 Next one.
01:48:56 He will generally give.
01:48:59 I mean he goes more into it like that if he doesn't like it he'll explain why if he
01:49:05 does like it he'll explain why they do tend the explanations tend to get shorter and
01:49:10 shorter but it's because like they start to fall into patterns that like you've seen already
01:49:16 like if a season has like a recurring theme that he finds really annoying like you know
01:49:22 he doesn't have to explain it multiple times he'll just be like oh it's another episode
01:49:26 like this only instead of this situation it's in that situation but it still does this this
01:49:32 and that so you know really annoying didn't like it bottom of the list anyway next episode.
01:49:39 Some some of them he'll have give a pretty short explanation for but you know usually
01:49:45 have a thing or two to say about each one.
01:49:49 I mean I guess I like the real gyms like season.
01:49:55 I love the real gyms.
01:49:57 Season reviews because in a smaller capsule when he's only talking about so many episodes
01:50:04 you can get more of a of a recommendation or like a sense of what it's like to watch
01:50:10 that season.
01:50:12 If you're doing like every episode you're gonna forget which ones are good by the end
01:50:17 and it's just YouTube squish.
01:50:20 Yeah I mean yeah you definitely forget.
01:50:25 He doesn't keep like a running tally of the full list.
01:50:29 He keeps a list of a by season like as he goes through the season he'll rank all the episodes
01:50:35 in the season and then only at the end does he give you the full list of like all you know
01:50:41 900 episodes he'll read up the names off in order like this is the full master my full
01:50:46 ranking for yeah I mean you definitely do not remember where every episode fell on the
01:50:56 list as he goes through them.
01:50:58 It's like many.
01:51:00 Like I appreciate that it's like type of like mindless content that's fun to just put on.
01:51:08 Yeah but I always like it when there's a bit of a point to the video.
01:51:14 Like Drew Gooden is a YouTuber who talks about all sorts of things.
01:51:20 He made a video comparing every season of Saturday Night Live to see if it actually has gotten less funny
01:51:28 or whatever and he had like that was the ideas like it's a question and he's gonna answer it by
01:51:34 watching an obscene amount of media and it's like oh yeah you know at the end he has a conclusion
01:51:40 and like something to talk about at the end of watching every Simpsons episodes I guess they just have
01:51:46 their favorites and their least favorites.
01:51:48 No.
01:51:49 Which is less engaging for me but it's fine.
01:51:52 I think see I feel like it's kind of the same because like I mean there sort of is an implicit
01:52:00 question there it's like well you know did it get as did it get bad like when did it get bad
01:52:07 and when did it get bad?
01:52:09 Yeah.
01:52:10 Did it get bad after season 8? Season 10?
01:52:12 He does come to conclusions at the end and he's like yeah so like after like this was
01:52:17 kind of the point where it fell off and like this this was the this was the like how I felt about it.
01:52:24 Like he has a different he comes to kind of different impressions of the of like Simpsons
01:52:32 versus Family Guy versus SpongeBob.
01:52:37 I think it's I think it's he gives a little bit of I guess you could call it analysis
01:52:44 enough that it's engaging for me anyway.
01:52:48 Alright.
01:52:49 I like them.
01:52:50 I have to pee again though so fuck.
01:52:55 BRB.
01:52:56 Damn.
01:52:57 Dang.
01:52:58 Eleazar put an image of Howard Hamlin smiling at the camera in the center of the screen
01:53:04 and slowly zoom in for 20 seconds.
01:53:08 And on top of that put a picture of Oyster smiling please.
01:53:12 Oyster smiling?
01:53:14 Do you know Celery Man?
01:53:16 I don't.
01:53:18 It's Tim and Eric's skit.
01:53:21 Oh I love Tim and Eric though.
01:53:23 Uh yeah it's uh yeah if you google Celery Man you'll find the clip.
01:53:29 Damn.
01:53:30 I think it's is it Paul Rudd?
01:53:33 Is that his name?
01:53:36 Guy who played Ant-Man.
01:53:37 Yeah Paul Rudd.
01:53:39 Oh my god.
01:53:40 His coffee spilled all over.
01:53:41 And he's Celery Man.
01:53:42 Oh he's not Celery Man but he's working.
01:53:45 And he's-
01:53:46 That is Paul Rudd.
01:53:47 Yeah he's got a computer.
01:53:50 I believe today is Sunday and tomorrow is Monday.
01:53:53 Better Call Saul Day.
01:53:56 You know Bob Odenkirk is on Tim and Eric as well.
01:54:00 A few people from Better Call Saul.
01:54:03 In fact a lot of the actors in Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad come from comedic backgrounds.
01:54:11 Yeah I know in Breaking Bad there was the two guys.
01:54:18 The big guy.
01:54:19 And then the little guy.
01:54:20 The ginger guy.
01:54:21 The ginger guy is um fuck I know his name.
01:54:24 He was in Star Wars.
01:54:25 I know his name.
01:54:26 I know there's a B in his name.
01:54:28 He was the guy for F is for Family and he's a great comedian as well.
01:54:34 Bill Burr.
01:54:35 Bill Burr.
01:54:36 Bill Burr.
01:54:37 And the other guy um what's his character's name?
01:54:42 Big fat guy.
01:54:44 Hewl.
01:54:45 Hewl Bobo.
01:54:46 Hewl.
01:54:47 He is I think a comedian as well.
01:54:49 I'm back.
01:54:50 What are we talking about?
01:54:52 I'm talking about comedic actors being in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.
01:54:57 You know I found a clip that didn't have that many views.
01:55:02 It was from like an older show Bob Odenkirk did way before Breaking Bad where he was like
01:55:07 man I had a job at a law firm and I had to quit for Chuck.
01:55:13 Wait you're talking about Mr. Show right?
01:55:15 I think so.
01:55:17 Yeah the law school sketch for Mr. Show.
01:55:20 I've seen people suggest that it's a yeah that it's the same character.
01:55:28 Well there's the law school sketch that has the actor for Chuck playing a law professor
01:55:33 with you know Bob Odenkirk.
01:55:35 Right.
01:55:36 In the background but there was like another show where he said where he said he had to
01:55:40 quit a law school quit like a job at a law firm for a guy named Chuck.
01:55:45 Oh I haven't seen that one.
01:55:46 That was like not Mr. Show.
01:55:47 That was like a separate clip.
01:55:48 Let me find it.
01:55:49 Oh weird.
01:55:50 The Bob Odenkirk Law Breaking Bad Mr. Show Chuck Saga Law Web is very tangly.
01:56:00 Here it is.
01:56:05 Welcome to law school.
01:56:07 I'm Professor Peans.
01:56:10 Oh that guy was on Tim and Eric as well.
01:56:15 No maybe.
01:56:16 Wait you mean David Cross?
01:56:19 The glasses guy.
01:56:22 There's two glasses guys.
01:56:24 The glasses guy with the no hair.
01:56:26 Oh my god they both have no hair.
01:56:29 The glasses guy with the gray hoodie.
01:56:31 That's David.
01:56:32 That's David Cross yeah.
01:56:33 Yeah.
01:56:34 Bob Odenkirk on news radio.
01:56:36 Wait this isn't Mr. Show.
01:56:39 Yeah I don't think this is Mr. Show.
01:56:42 This is like some other thing where he's like again pre-breaking bad.
01:56:45 Oh this is some other sketch comedy show that he did with David Cross.
01:56:50 But not Mr. Show.
01:56:52 I have to feel like the creators of.
01:56:55 And it's got all the same fucking people.
01:56:57 Both of these other all four of these people were in Mr. Show.
01:57:01 I don't know.
01:57:02 I recognize all of them.
01:57:04 There's another guy from Mr. Show who appears in like one episode of Better Call Saul in the most recent season.
01:57:11 I don't know if you've seen it yet.
01:57:14 I haven't watched, no I haven't seen the new season.
01:57:17 I haven't seen a single Better Call Saul.
01:57:20 Mr. Show has so many actors that like went on to do other things like Tom Kenny is in Mr. Show.
01:57:27 That's crazy.
01:57:28 Oh shit really.
01:57:29 Yeah he's really funny.
01:57:33 There's the girl.
01:57:37 I don't know some girl who was in I think in 24.
01:57:42 It was like Jack Bauer's assistant in like the first couple seasons of 24.
01:57:47 Was in Mr. Show.
01:57:51 There's a bunch more.
01:57:53 Yeah I think a bunch of people who went on to be in Tim and Eric and stuff.
01:57:58 Yeah this guy from this Tim and Eric skit was also a major character in Better Call Saul as well.
01:58:04 He played Cliff Mane.
01:58:07 I can't wait to watch that and be like oh the Cinco Phone Guy.
01:58:12 Yeah he plays a very important character.
01:58:16 Well maybe not super important but I think he's important.
01:58:19 I love Cliff Mane.
01:58:20 He's just an old man who's trying to be a good lawyer.
01:58:23 It had been a long time since the last Better Call Saul season came out right?
01:58:30 Yeah like a two year gap or something.
01:58:33 Okay then I think I was caught up because yeah I watched it a few years ago.
01:58:39 Did he get to the part with the Germans?
01:58:44 Ooh I don't know that doesn't ring a bell.
01:58:47 German engineers building.
01:58:50 Does that ring a bell?
01:58:52 Not really so maybe I did.
01:58:54 Oh my god you might not have even seen season 4 then.
01:58:57 You know what I don't think I did see season 4.
01:59:00 Shoot you gotta catch up.
01:59:02 And I don't remember what happened in season 3.
01:59:04 I'm so fucking stupid man I don't remember anything.
01:59:07 Oh god no.
01:59:09 I don't remember what happened in the show.
01:59:12 I almost said Mr. Show.
01:59:14 You gotta watch a retrospective more video.
01:59:18 I should watch LS Mark rank every episode of Better Call Saul and that will tell.
01:59:22 No just watch the show instead.
01:59:25 Why would I watch the show when I can watch an 8 hour long YouTube video explaining the show?
01:59:31 Yeah instead of watching a season for 8 hours.
01:59:35 Watching even longer even more time listening to a YouTuber tell me about it.
01:59:41 I should watch a fucking...
01:59:44 Oh I just watched a video.
01:59:48 It was explaining how react content is basically wage theft.
01:59:56 No.
01:59:59 No he's pretty much right.
02:00:02 No I agreed with it.
02:00:04 They made a really compelling case.
02:00:06 What was the case?
02:00:08 This is basically...
02:00:10 He used an example of some YouTuber who like his whole thing is just reacting to stuff.
02:00:19 It's basically just the idea that someone who does reaction content
02:00:27 basically it's other people invest the time and the effort and the money into making content
02:00:34 but that just becomes the content of a react streamer
02:00:41 and at the same time that person's reaction content is also taking views away from
02:00:52 not just the person that made the content originally but just the broader YouTube ecosystem.
02:00:59 Are you certain that they're taking views away?
02:01:03 He made a pretty compelling case that they do yeah.
02:01:07 I'm pretty sure that for certain things once you see somebody react to it
02:01:12 you don't care to go and check it out yourself because you've already seen it.
02:01:16 I think that's most things.
02:01:18 Well react channels now...
02:01:20 I think it really depends on the relative sizes of the audience though.
02:01:24 If they're like a big channel and you're like a small channel
02:01:27 that would probably bring more exposure than you'd have otherwise
02:01:30 and then you could get a lot more fans from that.
02:01:33 Okay, yes?
02:01:37 I wonder what the math is on that.
02:01:39 Like if you're small and a big react channel reacts to something
02:01:45 then yeah that's gonna bring exposure
02:01:49 but I think in terms of the entire ecosystem of YouTube
02:01:57 of like what are people watching
02:02:01 the general trend is like if people are watching react content
02:02:05 they're not watching original content and so on the whole
02:02:09 it does like take views away from other people who make content
02:02:13 and funnel it into people who merely aggregate it
02:02:19 in the form of reaction content.
02:02:24 And I think it's true, I agreed with it.
02:02:26 I only ever look at reaction videos for things I've already seen.
02:02:32 Yeah, I don't think...
02:02:35 I'm not sure if that's how most people do it
02:02:39 but I don't... how did I even get on this topic?
02:02:42 I guess most people are just...
02:02:45 I don't know, we're talking about Better Call Saul and then this happened.
02:02:48 Wait, fuck, why did I bring this up?
02:02:50 I had a point that I wanted to make.
02:02:53 You mentioned someone made a video about react channels being bad.
02:02:56 Yeah.
02:02:59 No, but why did I bring that video up?
02:03:02 Shit, what were we talking about before?
02:03:06 Something on the topic of watching long explanations of things instead of watching the thing.
02:03:13 Oh, yeah, I think I was just gonna...
02:03:16 I think that was all in service and I was gonna joke that I was just gonna watch
02:03:20 and go and react to Better Call Saul instead of watching Better Call Saul.
02:03:25 Yeah, that was it.
02:03:28 Yeah, that's it, that's all.
02:03:30 I do watch people react to Better Call Saul and because...
02:03:35 When it's like network television, I feel like...
02:03:38 When it's network television, I don't think it has the same.
02:03:42 I don't care that much.
02:03:44 Well, especially because to avoid copyright detection, they have to like...
02:03:47 They can't even show the whole episode, they just kind of have to edit it down to like...
02:03:51 Yeah.
02:03:52 Like just like half the length of the actual episode, just like the highlights.
02:03:56 That makes sense.
02:03:58 Actually, you know, what I would agree is wage theft is when channels are like...
02:04:02 If you want to see the unedited full reaction, sign up for my Patreon.
02:04:06 People who do that, I'm like, that's a little scummy.
02:04:08 What the fuck?
02:04:09 Wait, hey, I reacted to How to Train Your Dragon if you want to watch...
02:04:14 I only show like 30 minutes worth of highlights on YouTube.
02:04:17 If you want to see my full unedited reaction, go to Patreon.
02:04:19 I'm like, wouldn't that be more of a copyright violation since people...
02:04:22 It's behind a paywall?
02:04:24 Also, who would pay for that?
02:04:25 Yeah, it absolutely is.
02:04:27 Like, who would pay money to see that?
02:04:30 Like, you could buy the movie for the price of that.
02:04:34 I mean, reaction content has always been like a...
02:04:39 How legal is it, actually, sort of thing.
02:04:43 If you just...
02:04:44 I feel like if somebody is like commentating...
02:04:47 Like, you can do a commentary of a thing.
02:04:50 You're not really supposed to put the film in there.
02:04:53 You can have a commentary track that you can play with the film that you own.
02:04:57 But like a reaction YouTuber, is it a video they have of just the whole film?
02:05:04 Here's the video I saw.
02:05:08 Uh, yeah.
02:05:11 Reactors, the professional parasites, how everyone loses except...
02:05:15 I believe it, even if it was false.
02:05:17 Because I just don't like reaction content.
02:05:20 Uh, I hadn't really thought about it.
02:05:22 Oh, wait, I know this guy. He attacked Dream.
02:05:26 Wait, uh, Dark Viper or Asmongold?
02:05:30 Yeah, Dark Viper, he fucking confronted Dream on his cheating bullshit
02:05:35 and like called him out pretty hard when it happened.
02:05:38 And Dream was like, oh, no, no, no, no, man.
02:05:41 Oh, let me convince you, but I'm not cheating and he would...
02:05:44 Oh, well.
02:05:45 Pretty good.
02:05:46 Well, we all know how that...
02:05:47 Dream was a duity cheater.
02:05:48 Yeah, I don't think...
02:05:50 I've never seen or heard Dream,
02:05:53 but I have a strong negative opinion of him from everything that I've heard.
02:06:01 He makes...
02:06:05 He's able to pull off cool Minecraft stunts
02:06:10 when playing against his friends and speedrunning.
02:06:12 Well, they try and kill him and all that shit.
02:06:14 Well, over time, more and more, it feels like the videos are becoming more staged.
02:06:21 Yeah.
02:06:22 And he's also kind of a dickhead.
02:06:25 He's a real Ben St on that Twitter just going out attacking people
02:06:30 or some shit I actually don't know if he attacks people.
02:06:33 I don't believe for a second that he is anything like me.
02:06:38 You know, probably not.
02:06:40 That just doesn't track.
02:06:42 Look, I can't roll it out if I haven't checked.
02:06:45 I'd be okay, yeah, true.
02:06:48 Yeah.
02:06:50 Maybe.
02:06:52 Oh, take any chances.
02:06:54 Oh, there's a new Sean video.
02:06:56 The weirdest thing.
02:06:57 I'll watch that later.
02:06:59 The weirdest thing to come out of that was the fucking Numberphile guy making a video about Dream.
02:07:04 Matt Parker?
02:07:06 Yeah, Matt Parker.
02:07:08 That was crazy.
02:07:10 Oh, I don't know if I saw...
02:07:12 I mean, I heard...
02:07:14 I think it was Carl Yobbs.
02:07:16 I think I heard Carl Yobbs explain how Dream definitely cheated.
02:07:23 Carl Yobbs?
02:07:25 Or J-Jobbs?
02:07:27 I don't know how to say it, yeah.
02:07:29 I don't know how to pronounce it.
02:07:30 Maybe you're correct.
02:07:32 All I know is that this video is the best video by far on all of that stuff
02:07:37 because it's maths.
02:07:39 Yeah, I can trust Matt Parker to be somewhat good at maths.
02:07:44 I was convinced that, like, yeah, mathematically.
02:07:48 I mean, at this point, like, he's admitted to cheating, so...
02:07:51 Yeah.
02:07:52 It's not that there's any question about it, but, yeah, back then,
02:07:55 when it was kind of a new thing, I remember I watched...
02:07:57 I think it was the Carl Yobbs video.
02:07:59 I was like, okay, so the maths says that it's definitely...
02:08:02 he definitely cheated and he's just a liar.
02:08:04 Dream is such...
02:08:06 I mean, he's a product of, like, the way, like, the algorithm and luck
02:08:14 can elevate, like, complete who cares, nobody's into such positions of power.
02:08:21 He's just some kid.
02:08:23 And he's like, um, I think cheat.
02:08:27 I've hired a real physicist, astrophysicist, to prove otherwise.
02:08:32 And it became news.
02:08:35 It's just some...
02:08:36 Yeah.
02:08:37 He's just a rat.
02:08:39 And he's, like, a god.
02:08:42 The world has made it a god.
02:08:44 Yeah.
02:08:45 What's even more of a dream is Mr. Beast.
02:08:47 And specifically, Mr. Beast's worthless friends.
02:08:50 They just look like kids who sat in school and played Call of Duty and did nothing,
02:08:55 and now they're, like, millionaires because they're friends with a guy.
02:08:59 I don't know anything about them or...
02:09:03 All I know about Mr. Beast is just...
02:09:05 That's just the guy who, like, spends tons of money on stuff, right?
02:09:08 Well, he, like, gives, like, tens of thousands of dollars to people all the fucking time in his videos.
02:09:14 That's pretty cool.
02:09:15 I like that he gives, like, a lot of money away.
02:09:18 It's very clickable content to see some person get given a free car in their reaction.
02:09:26 And they're like, oh my god, what?
02:09:28 A free car?
02:09:29 First person to leave, last person to leave this circle wins two million dollars,
02:09:34 and it's like 100 people standing in a big circle,
02:09:36 and every day they make the circle smaller,
02:09:38 or they throw in little hazards to fuck with them,
02:09:40 or they're like, oh, if you walk outside the circle on this plank,
02:09:43 you can get, like, $30,000 right now,
02:09:45 but if you fall off the plank, you get nothing.
02:09:48 It's just fucking with...
02:09:50 Just dangling money in front of people like keys.
02:09:53 But, like, even when people lose, they'll still give them a couple thousand anyway,
02:09:56 just to be nice.
02:09:58 And it's like, okay.
02:09:59 I mean...
02:10:01 I mean, sure, yeah.
02:10:04 I guess.
02:10:06 I don't find the content, like, that interesting,
02:10:09 but, like, the fact that it's as big as it is is amusing,
02:10:13 and, like, interesting in that way.
02:10:15 It's like, ah, well, like, I saw this video where he made a chocolate factory,
02:10:21 like Willy Wonka,
02:10:23 and he had people go through the chocolate factory doing tusks,
02:10:28 and if they win, they get to own the factory.
02:10:31 But then at the end, he's like,
02:10:33 actually, you can sell me that factory for, like, $100,000 or something.
02:10:39 And so it's just, like, giving people money.
02:10:42 That's very funny.
02:10:43 He had, like, a...
02:10:44 That's a very funny thing to do.
02:10:45 Yeah, and it's like, that's kind of cool.
02:10:47 The actual content is kind of YouTuber, screamy, like, not really my thing.
02:10:53 Just the fact that he had, like, all of that, like, a huge set,
02:10:57 so many camera crews, like, all of these...
02:10:59 Like, when he built Squid Game,
02:11:01 that was like, huh, he actually did that.
02:11:04 I think it was just brown water, but, I mean, that's how it was in the movie.
02:11:08 Yeah.
02:11:11 Now, that's content.
02:11:12 Yeah.
02:11:15 Yeah.
02:11:16 We need a hundred Mr. Beasts,
02:11:18 and then there'd be so much great content.
02:11:21 If we had a hundred Mr. Beasts, everyone would have a...
02:11:25 Sorry, I was distracted by a dinosaur image.
02:11:28 No, that's the ending of Better Call Saul, Kim Ghost of a Dinosaurs.
02:11:32 It's true.
02:11:33 Oh, darn.
02:11:35 Let me spoil it.
02:11:37 I don't know who any of that is.
02:11:39 These are characters from Better Call Saul, and they're cool.
02:11:45 That's a guy from Mr. Show.
02:11:49 That was a famous guy who was on Mr. Show, just like everybody.
02:11:53 More like Better Cock Saul.
02:11:55 Am I right?
02:11:57 I don't...
02:11:59 You know, before I watched Ivor's show,
02:12:02 my friends were telling me about Better Call Saul,
02:12:04 and I'm like, Better Call Saul, more like, Better Fuck Chuck.
02:12:07 And they were laughing.
02:12:09 They were laughing real hard, because little did I know
02:12:12 what would actually happen when I watched the show.
02:12:17 I just realized that picture of Saul and Mike is in the AVGN room.
02:12:23 Oh, my God.
02:12:29 Gained some lotion. They're looking a little tan.
02:12:34 They're looking a little, yeah, I mean, blotchy.
02:12:39 They look like they could use some grafts.
02:12:46 Save them.
02:12:49 Okay.
02:12:50 With voicemails.
02:12:52 Yeah, I was actually just gonna say,
02:12:55 we've been going for two and a half hours.
02:12:57 Is it time to go to voicemails?
02:12:58 Yeah, yeah.
02:13:00 Okay, well, let's do it.
02:13:04 Go to speakbive.com.
02:13:06 Is that the voicemails?
02:13:08 Is that the...
02:13:10 Yeah, to leave a voicemail.
02:13:14 Okay.
02:13:16 Let's see here.
02:13:18 Did we listen to this one called Serious Question Time?
02:13:21 I just got to close my window in case Moth's coming.
02:13:26 I drew giant testicles during this recording, by the way.
02:13:29 I just wanted to let people know about it.
02:13:31 I'm back.
02:13:32 Welcome back.
02:13:33 Okay.
02:13:34 Is the...
02:13:36 Did we listen to this vocaru one called Son of a Glitch?
02:13:40 No, we heard this one, didn't we?
02:13:42 This one?
02:13:43 This one called Son of a Glitch, a vocaru.
02:13:45 Yes, we did.
02:13:47 What is multiple, potentially?
02:13:49 We'll listen just in case.
02:13:51 All right, let's try this vocaru one.
02:13:54 Wait, wasn't this you, Oblivion?
02:13:56 Yeah, these are me.
02:13:59 I know I sent one in right after you stopped recording last week,
02:14:03 so this is probably a new one.
02:14:05 Okay, okay.
02:14:07 Yeah, well, let's listen.
02:14:10 Uh, three, two, one, go.
02:14:13 My favorite show on the internet, Son of a Glitch.
02:14:17 Here's to top five video games I've put in my arsehole.
02:14:20 Number one, Mario.
02:14:26 You put them in?
02:14:28 Now that's content.
02:14:30 There is no game called Mario that's Super Mario Brothers
02:14:33 or Mario Brothers or Mario Go typing.
02:14:37 I think the full quote was Mario, all of them,
02:14:41 but I cut it short.
02:14:43 So Son of a Glitch, I should confess, right?
02:14:47 Me and my friend Maid, who the pilot he worked on
02:14:51 is coming out like tomorrow.
02:14:53 Pilot?
02:14:55 It's called Monkey Wrench.
02:14:57 It's a show by Zarell, big YouTube animator.
02:15:00 Oh, he's working on that.
02:15:02 He made a 22-minute long pilot episode of a show.
02:15:05 Maid worked on a bunch of scenes for it,
02:15:07 and Zarell did all the cleanup.
02:15:10 Imagine a 22-minute TV quality animation
02:15:13 where all the line work for all the animation
02:15:15 was done by one guy.
02:15:17 That's insane.
02:15:19 Yeah, Zarell did all the cleanup.
02:15:22 How long did it take to burn?
02:15:25 Oh, like at least three years.
02:15:27 But anyways, me and Maid, we played Minecraft.
02:15:30 We played the new update.
02:15:32 It was spooky, it was scary, and we were just goofing around
02:15:34 and I recorded it, and we were doing funny
02:15:36 video game reviewer voices,
02:15:38 and I just clipped a bunch of those
02:15:40 and just made them into voicemails.
02:15:42 So that's what all that shit is.
02:15:46 Okay, I'm glad we know the back story
02:15:49 of Son of a Glitch.
02:15:51 There's probably going to be even more, who knows.
02:15:55 Shower me with them.
02:15:58 The next non-worthless voicemail
02:16:01 is I think it's this one called Pigeon Circus in Tampa.
02:16:04 I just posted it there.
02:16:07 Okay, three, two, one, go.
02:16:10 Konnichiwa.
02:16:11 Okay.
02:16:13 Samurai-san.
02:16:15 Venno Sentosa.
02:16:17 You have this oneru.
02:16:20 Samurai Master.
02:16:22 True.
02:16:23 Shinzo Abe-san.
02:16:25 Conservative Nationally.
02:16:29 Nationally.
02:16:30 Icon-ness.
02:16:32 Faka-yu.
02:16:34 Practice.
02:16:35 Venno Sentosa.
02:16:38 Apo-yozo.
02:16:40 Boku morare.
02:16:42 Wiru-si.
02:16:44 Buu kanseru.
02:16:48 Until you next time.
02:16:50 Sayonara.
02:16:53 I fucking love that quote so much.
02:16:56 I gave the assassin his contraption.
02:17:00 Yeah, I found it in my basement.
02:17:03 Wait a minute.
02:17:05 That reminds me of this guy who I found on Twitter.
02:17:12 His name is Seth-sama or Sephiroth Sword.
02:17:17 And I cannot tell if he is satirizing something
02:17:24 or if this is like how he is.
02:17:28 I don't know. Check this fucking tweet out.
02:17:32 Just...
02:17:34 Man.
02:17:36 Okay.
02:17:38 And then he made a video of himself.
02:17:43 Okay, I got two more.
02:17:45 Two more of this guy's tweets.
02:17:48 His tribute.
02:17:50 He made a video montage of himself drawing his tribute to Shinzo Abe.
02:17:56 And the tribute is this right here.
02:18:02 And...
02:18:04 Okay, looking at this, I know you'd think this is like a parody, right?
02:18:10 You'd think this is like satire, but I don't know.
02:18:13 Because this guy...
02:18:15 I've checked out some of his videos and there's no artistry to them at all.
02:18:20 There's no sense that he's doing a bit.
02:18:24 There's no delivery. There's no comedy to them.
02:18:28 It's just...
02:18:30 How do you keep finding these weirdos?
02:18:33 I found this guy a while ago when I just followed his Twitter because he was funny.
02:18:37 But then I just saw this Abe tribute and I was like, whoa, this guy is delivering.
02:18:42 This guy is delivering?
02:18:46 Oh, I don't know.
02:18:49 If anyone wants to look more deeply into Sephiroth's Sama...
02:18:55 He's even got a little Sonic on the end of his buster sword.
02:19:00 I genuinely do not know what to think of this guy, but I am fascinated.
02:19:09 That's all.
02:19:12 The next...
02:19:15 I had a realization even though I just realized something.
02:19:18 What's up?
02:19:19 Yeah.
02:19:21 I'm just getting a screenshot here.
02:19:25 I cannot wait to see what you've uncovered.
02:19:28 Yeah, this is a little bit wild.
02:19:30 I don't think we were meant to see this, but...
02:19:34 Oh, no.
02:19:36 Oh, no.
02:19:38 Oh, no.
02:19:41 Oh, no.
02:19:43 Ben Orochi, Orochi-sama.
02:19:46 I think I cracked the code.
02:19:49 Is that Mike Scully?
02:19:52 No, it's the other guy.
02:19:54 It's James P. Sullivan.
02:19:56 Mike Scully.
02:19:58 That's the green guy, right?
02:20:00 I've never seen Monster's Inc.
02:20:02 Why did I say Scully?
02:20:04 Because this guy is Sully.
02:20:07 Same energy. They're the same guy.
02:20:10 They're identical.
02:20:12 Fascinating.
02:20:14 Oh, my God, there's a spider so close to me.
02:20:17 Ew.
02:20:19 There was a Daddy Long Legs the other day in my room.
02:20:24 That's pretty rare.
02:20:26 There's not usually bugs in here, which is the one nice thing.
02:20:29 The one good thing I could say about my shitty apartment is that there's usually not bugs in my room.
02:20:35 On that day, that failed.
02:20:38 Even that...
02:20:40 It failed to clear even that low bar.
02:20:42 Anyway, what?
02:20:44 It's like the tiny little garden spider, the size of a piece of crumb.
02:20:49 I found...
02:20:51 And he was leisurely walking up the wall.
02:20:53 Oh, no, he stopped and then he's going.
02:20:55 Yeah, I found there was a Daddy Long Legs walking around near the end of my bed,
02:21:02 not on the bed, just at the floor near it.
02:21:05 And then on a paper plate that I had been eating a sandwich on,
02:21:12 I found there was a tiny, tiny, tiny little spider walking around on it.
02:21:17 Sucks.
02:21:19 Hate this.
02:21:20 Hate this shit.
02:21:22 The next voicemail, I'm posting it now.
02:21:24 Shit, I already posted it.
02:21:26 It's called Prince in the Big City.
02:21:30 I think I know what this is about.
02:21:32 Three, two, one, go.
02:21:35 Wow.
02:21:37 Boston, the Big Apple.
02:21:40 I finally arrived.
02:21:43 Amazing.
02:21:44 RFCKcon7 here I come.
02:21:48 Anyways, I guess the first thing I should do is go and kill Ben St.
02:21:55 Yeah, number one.
02:21:57 I have to figure out one thing before I can get to his location
02:22:02 by my preferred mode of transportation.
02:22:06 Where are the bike lanes?
02:22:11 Where are the bike lanes?
02:22:13 This guy is like Danish or something,
02:22:18 lives in some some frugal European country where they ride bikes.
02:22:22 I heard Boston had great walkability and stuff,
02:22:27 but no bike lanes.
02:22:29 Yeah, not bike ability.
02:22:31 That fucking sucks.
02:22:32 Fuck Boston.
02:22:35 There aren't many bike lanes.
02:22:37 It's true.
02:22:38 You just got to have helis.
02:22:39 You just got to have roller blades.
02:22:42 Oh, you know, actually, you might be right.
02:22:46 You know, I mean, people do ride bikes around.
02:22:50 I don't think we don't have dedicated bike lanes.
02:22:52 I think you just ride on the fucking...
02:22:54 Oh my God.
02:22:55 Just ride in the breakdown lane.
02:22:56 You ride right in the middle of the road to avoid cars going either way.
02:23:00 Actually, did you see...
02:23:02 Yeah, right down the middle in between, yep.
02:23:04 Did you see that fruity...
02:23:05 I have a storm.
02:23:07 That fruity document that the Texas GOP cooked up a few weeks ago.
02:23:12 A fruity document from the GOP?
02:23:15 Nah.
02:23:16 Okay, the Texas GOP released a document that was full of absolutely psycho-insane shit
02:23:23 that they want to do if they win.
02:23:26 And it's textless, so they're going to.
02:23:29 It's...
02:23:30 Yeah, but this is like worse than you think if you haven't heard of it already.
02:23:34 Like...
02:23:35 I mean, I think they want to, you know, make gay marriage illegal.
02:23:40 That's one thing.
02:23:42 Outlaw, yeah, outlaw gender.
02:23:45 Outlaw gender, period.
02:23:48 Yeah.
02:23:49 Okay, so like...
02:23:51 Yeah, they want to get rid of, you know, gay marriage.
02:23:54 Obviously, they don't fucking do that.
02:23:55 Contraception.
02:23:56 No more contraception alone.
02:23:57 Yeah, they want to get rid of contraception.
02:23:58 They want to get rid of all-sex education at all levels and all grades.
02:24:02 Even a harm prevention and risk aversion.
02:24:05 They want to get rid of that education too.
02:24:08 Right.
02:24:09 They...
02:24:10 So they can more easily take advantage of them.
02:24:12 Preventing harm is so fucking woke.
02:24:14 We got to stop that.
02:24:16 Yeah, we can't teach kids about stranger danger.
02:24:18 Like, even that's got to go apparently.
02:24:20 Yeah, that's pretty woke.
02:24:22 Because they don't think we're strangers.
02:24:24 Yeah.
02:24:25 They want to like make it like super hard to get a divorce.
02:24:29 They want to abolish for minimum wage.
02:24:31 They want to abolish paid leave of all kinds, including family leave and sick leave.
02:24:36 They want to, you know, just normal stuff.
02:24:40 They want to declassify carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.
02:24:43 You know, they want to have it written into law that science is wrong apparently.
02:24:47 They want to ban high-speed rail.
02:24:49 They want to ban funding for...
02:24:51 What do you mean ban high-speed rail?
02:24:53 They want to make it illegal to build high-speed rail anywhere, even on private property.
02:24:57 Because they want cars instead, right?
02:24:59 What the fuck?
02:25:00 That's just insane.
02:25:01 They want to make it illegal to publicly fund slow rail.
02:25:05 They want to make it illegal to fund alternate lanes for like, you know, bike lanes and bus lanes.
02:25:10 And any infrastructure, even sidewalks potentially, I don't fucking know.
02:25:15 You know, I didn't think you were going to surprise me.
02:25:17 But yeah, wow.
02:25:18 I mean, this is like comedically evil.
02:25:22 But like, what are they trying to get votes from this?
02:25:27 I don't know.
02:25:28 Like, who likes this?
02:25:30 I don't know.
02:25:31 I mean, I know some people liking...
02:25:34 No gay marriage, you know, like Backwoods, Hillbillies, Losers, Bigots.
02:25:39 They have their social issues.
02:25:42 But like, who's against train?
02:25:45 I mean, like, illegal to make new trains?
02:25:50 Like, are people seething about trains existing?
02:25:53 I think trains are commie shit, clearly.
02:25:57 I think it's just one of...
02:25:58 I think that's probably just one that like, most people don't care about.
02:26:01 Yeah, but like...
02:26:03 That's something they want to do.
02:26:05 Like, that's not most people's like, top of their issues list.
02:26:11 And the same document also has multiple sections about, we believe in small government.
02:26:15 It's like, fuck off.
02:26:16 No, you don't.
02:26:17 Yeah.
02:26:18 This is not small government banning, building basic shit.
02:26:22 They also want to...
02:26:23 Yeah, that's a say the line, Bart.
02:26:27 Say the line, Bart.
02:26:28 Small government.
02:26:29 Yay!
02:26:30 Yeah.
02:26:31 Yeah, abolished environmental protection agency, repeal of the Endangered Species Act,
02:26:35 eliminate campaign contribution limits.
02:26:37 That's clearly a good idea.
02:26:39 That's not the...
02:26:47 If that doesn't just give the game away right there.
02:26:50 Yeah, they also want electoral collage, like the electoral college for all like,
02:26:56 Congress appointments from Texas, which would basically like guarantee 100% Republicans
02:27:02 getting in from here, which would be dumb.
02:27:05 Right.
02:27:06 And anti-democrat.
02:27:07 Right.
02:27:08 There's also a section about teachers being forced to have guns in class, among other normal shit.
02:27:14 I think the average conservative doesn't want to minimum wage and wants no sick leave
02:27:19 and family.
02:27:20 That's pretty normal.
02:27:21 It's pretty normal stuff.
02:27:22 I think you're appealing to the base.
02:27:23 I joke.
02:27:24 This is like insane shit.
02:27:25 I don't know.
02:27:26 Honestly, they might for all I know.
02:27:28 I don't know.
02:27:29 I mean, I don't know.
02:27:30 Kai's mom is like very conservative, but like, even she is like, this shit's like fucking
02:27:36 nuts.
02:27:37 I don't know what they're doing.
02:27:40 I don't know.
02:27:41 It really does like...
02:27:44 If only it would trigger some self-reflection.
02:27:46 Like, is this what I've been voting for all along?
02:27:49 Oh, actually.
02:27:50 I mean, I think it actually might when it gets to this.
02:27:53 No.
02:27:54 No.
02:27:55 This far.
02:27:56 No.
02:27:57 No.
02:27:58 I think...
02:27:59 Sorry.
02:28:00 Sorry.
02:28:01 It won't.
02:28:02 I promise.
02:28:03 Well...
02:28:04 It would have already.
02:28:05 It would have already.
02:28:06 What I mean is that there are a lot of people who voted Republican, voted for Donald Trump,
02:28:10 that aren't quite as insane as all of that.
02:28:14 I feel like the people who love all of those things listed are not enough of a majority
02:28:20 to win, like, the entire presidency.
02:28:23 If they're going like full mask off, evil policies everywhere, the Republicans are
02:28:29 not going to look as good.
02:28:31 Right?
02:28:32 Yeah.
02:28:33 I don't think it...
02:28:36 They wouldn't share this information if it would hurt their electoral chances.
02:28:43 My favorite addition that I haven't yet mentioned is compelled speech.
02:28:47 Remember when Jordan Peterson lied about Bill C-16 and talked about how for governments
02:28:51 going to force you to use people's preferred pronouns?
02:28:54 They're going to force you not to use people's preferred pronouns.
02:28:58 They've classified social transition as abuse, and anyone facilitating it in any way is breaking
02:29:04 the law is another thing they want to do for anyone under the age of 21.
02:29:08 So if you have a friend who's 21 or younger and you call them she, and that's not what
02:29:14 they were assigned, you're breaking the law.
02:29:17 I would say, as a conservative, as a Republican voter, I would say that freedom of speech is
02:29:24 pretty woke and should probably be abolished, yeah.
02:29:30 As a small government libertarian, I do think that freedom of speech is Marxism.
02:29:36 I really, the long short, I want to get out of Texas.
02:29:44 This place is starting to fucking suck.
02:29:47 It's getting real bad.
02:29:49 Texas is bad.
02:29:51 Well, I mean, I like to think that human beings are not what these policies imply about humans.
02:30:02 There's plenty of people like what?
02:30:05 Yeah.
02:30:06 I don't think most people are like, yes, we should defund the railways.
02:30:14 I don't think most people are like into that, but I just don't think, I think people who
02:30:22 are socially conservative will continue to vote Republican, basically regardless of
02:30:26 all this other stuff, because that's all secondary.
02:30:28 Yeah.
02:30:29 Yeah.
02:30:30 Like the impression I get from Cairo's relatives is that they would all, if you told them about
02:30:37 any of the stuff they'd say, that shit's all insane and crazy and stupid, but they're
02:30:41 also like, well, I don't know, I'm never voting for a Democrat.
02:30:44 My daddy voted Republican and they just do it, and that's as far as I think about it,
02:30:53 which is bad.
02:30:54 Another reason I have to get out is because I wouldn't be able to get a US citizenship
02:30:57 if they pass all this shit, because another thing, if citizenship becomes impossible
02:31:03 unless your biological parents are US citizens, which is translation for no one can immigrate
02:31:10 at all.
02:31:12 I heard, man, I don't remember where I read this.
02:31:16 It might have just been an anecdote or something, but I think it was about Romney, apparently
02:31:23 voters, Romney could say, I plan to, I am running for governor or whatever, I'm running
02:31:33 for senator.
02:31:34 My platform is, I am going to cut taxes, basically cut taxes for the rich and for corporations
02:31:43 and raise taxes on the poor and middle class, and he could just say that, and people just
02:31:49 would not believe it.
02:31:50 People would just like, and then you could tell someone, yeah, this is his platform,
02:31:55 and people would just be like, there's no way that's his platform.
02:31:58 There's no way he's actually running, even though he was, right?
02:32:01 Maybe it wasn't about Romney.
02:32:02 It was something.
02:32:03 I think people just don't, people just don't, I don't know, they'll vote Republican even
02:32:11 if you tell them that, they'll just be like, nah, that can't be right, nah, they can't
02:32:16 really, yeah, but they're not really going to, no, that's all just, all that stuff about
02:32:21 defunding the rail and no minimum wage and freedom of speech is illegal.
02:32:28 That's not what, no, they're the party of small government, they're not actually going
02:32:32 to do that, so like we can still vote for them just to kill trans people and like, so
02:32:35 it's, yeah, it's fine, it's fine, all the other stuff is just...
02:32:39 No joke about killing trans people, yeah.
02:32:41 There's that guy, Mark Burns in South Carolina who was running for Congress, who went on
02:32:46 a podcast and talked openly about how he wants to execute all the LGBT people and went through
02:32:52 his step-by-step plan on how they would legally kill off all the fucking gay and trans people,
02:32:58 and he wrote about that for like two minutes, and then the people on the podcast clapped
02:33:02 and said, wow, this is our guy, everyone, but they literally said the our guy thing.
02:33:08 No, it's okay, you'd only have to kill like a few, you'd only have to do a few public
02:33:14 executions and then like, you know, the fear that that would create would drive all the
02:33:19 rest back into the closet, so like we wouldn't, we didn't actually have to kill that many,
02:33:23 so like it's good actually.
02:33:25 Let's give him a hand, let's give him a big round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.
02:33:41 But he got 25% of the vote even after saying that, that's like half the way to win.
02:33:47 I'm not surprised, yeah, because most people just don't care, yeah.
02:33:51 I put them all in one place and set it on fire.
02:33:56 I wonder, I'm starting to wonder if we're gonna balkanize.
02:34:03 It's kind of starting to feel that way, I know that that's probably, I'm probably jumping
02:34:06 the gun, but like, I don't know, we might balkanize over this shit, man.
02:34:16 What is balkanizing?
02:34:18 You know, it's when, it's like what happened in the Balkans, it's like, you know, they
02:34:22 split up a country into like a bunch of small like independent states.
02:34:28 I'm saying that the United States would like split into, split into small, several, yeah.
02:34:35 Then I know the people born in the wrong, that would be catastrophic for many levels.
02:34:40 Especially for people who are stuck living with their parents who can't get out of the
02:34:44 shitty part they were born into.
02:34:46 Oh, I mean, aside from, oh yeah, it would be, it would, living in the balkanized like,
02:34:54 you know, fucking, I don't know, the conservative Republic of Texas or whatever with no like
02:35:01 federal oversight would be like, it would be like Saudi Arabia, you know, it would be
02:35:07 on that level, like if you're, if you're not straight and white and probably male, like
02:35:15 he would not want to live there.
02:35:22 So I'm not saying it's good, but I, I, COVID, COVID comeback, we miss you.
02:35:29 No, it's still, it's still here, actually.
02:35:31 No, but I mean, like really come back, like, like put everyone, don't, don't, don't, don't
02:35:36 think we're, don't think it's gone.
02:35:38 They want to ban contact tracing.
02:35:40 So if they're trying to bring COVID back, I mean, ban, ban contact.
02:35:45 What does that even mean?
02:35:46 Contact tracing is like, if someone catches COVID, like they would like, like, okay,
02:35:50 like, where have you been, like for the last, like, you know, week or two, since
02:35:54 you were contagious, what areas have you visited so we can like keep an eye out for
02:35:58 cases? How would you ban that?
02:36:00 They want to make it illegal to ask people where they've been, I guess, because they
02:36:05 don't want information on where the disease is spreading, because I guess that invades
02:36:10 privacy, maybe, I don't know.
02:36:14 Well, abolish, abolish no-fault divorce.
02:36:18 Yeah.
02:36:19 And also have a six month waiting period for any divorce, regardless of the reason.
02:36:23 So if like, they're like beating you and trying to kill you, well, you have to wait
02:36:26 six months, even in like extreme situations.
02:36:31 They're just crazy.
02:36:32 They want you to die.
02:36:33 They want you to die.
02:36:34 They want you to suffer.
02:36:35 They want you to have no money.
02:36:37 They want rich people to control everything.
02:36:41 They're like very transparent about it.
02:36:43 I don't understand.
02:36:45 People, people like genuinely don't believe it.
02:36:47 Like the average person would see this lit.
02:36:50 I don't, I don't think they would read this list and be like, this is bad.
02:36:56 I think that it was just they would read it and be like, well, you know, this is all
02:37:01 just this is all just talk, you know, I wrote that list myself.
02:37:06 I read the document.
02:37:07 That's all in there.
02:37:09 Oh, very nice.
02:37:10 Oh, uh, I just, um, most people got there like one or two issues and like anything
02:37:18 else is just not going to move them on, on whatever it is.
02:37:25 Uh, so.
02:37:29 I, I self selfishly, I feel like it would be cool to be rid of these freaks if we
02:37:37 balkanized and I would just, I would be safe in the, uh, in the, in the liberal,
02:37:42 uh, what do you call it?
02:37:43 I would, I would be straight in the liberal commonwealth of New England or whatever.
02:37:48 Uh, but then, but then, you know, uh, the, the Republicans would probably
02:37:53 just like declare war or something.
02:37:55 They would probably do some shit.
02:37:57 Yeah.
02:37:58 So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's only a fantasy.
02:38:03 Probably, probably shouldn't be rooting for it.
02:38:07 On his fucking, uh, true for a website.
02:38:09 He liked someone like truth, damn, I guess it's time for a civil war to deal with
02:38:14 these fucking gays or whatever.
02:38:16 I don't know the actual, well, the actual issue was about and Trump just liked
02:38:19 that, that fucking truth, I fucking hate that.
02:38:24 Truth, truth, the, uh, the, the website where instead of tweets, it's truth.
02:38:28 I fucking hate it's annoying.
02:38:29 It makes, they're destroying language.
02:38:32 They say we're destroying language, but they're destroying language, I swear.
02:38:37 Um, do you want to listen to the next voicemail?
02:38:42 Yes.
02:38:42 Yeah.
02:38:43 Please.
02:38:44 Uh, the next voicemail, I already posted it.
02:38:47 It's Prince in the big city too.
02:38:50 Uh, it's up above the list there.
02:38:51 All right.
02:38:53 Uh, three, two, one, go.
02:38:56 Ben, that is like the fourth cop car that I see riding around Boston.
02:39:04 You're not doing your fucking job.
02:39:07 Uh, oh, by the way, um, I'm Dutch just, uh, to explain the last voicemail.
02:39:14 Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm Dutch.
02:39:17 I don't understand why you people think it's acceptable to, uh, to paint
02:39:23 fucking, uh, bike signals onto the concrete road that huge fucking cars drive
02:39:30 across all day.
02:39:31 I know.
02:39:32 That's just asking for bike people to get turned into God damn roadkill.
02:39:37 Uh, but anyways, um, looking forward to the first, uh, cyclist I see
02:39:42 splattered across the pavement.
02:39:44 I haven't seen one yet.
02:39:45 Anyways, Boston is nice.
02:39:47 Uh, see you.
02:39:49 Well, yeah.
02:39:50 There are hundreds of cyclists.
02:39:53 Uh, yeah, I think, um, I think he's here early.
02:39:56 I think RFC KCon is like this weekend.
02:40:00 It's just a bunch of people, just a bunch of RFC K people, uh, getting
02:40:03 together in a, in a house in Boston.
02:40:06 Uh, I'll probably go visit, uh, say hi.
02:40:12 So that'll be fun.
02:40:13 But it is the weekend.
02:40:14 The weekend's almost over.
02:40:17 I mean, I mean, next weekend.
02:40:19 Oh, see.
02:40:20 All right.
02:40:20 I think, I think it was, yeah, it's the 21st.
02:40:24 I remember we were going to judge the next art contest during it on the 21st.
02:40:28 So I think that's, or maybe it's all this week.
02:40:32 Uh, I, I don't actually know.
02:40:35 I should check, I should check when it's happening.
02:40:38 Uh, I guess Prince is here early.
02:40:40 Uh, okay.
02:40:42 And then a bunch of worthless ones that don't count.
02:40:45 Um, okay.
02:40:48 Next one is an iconic PCP character returns question mark.
02:40:53 Posting it now.
02:40:55 There it is.
02:40:56 Three, two, one, go.
02:41:05 Can you hear it?
02:41:07 No, I hear is the scrabbling is the joke that the iconic character is inaudible.
02:41:16 Wait, this is a guy from the other week who was just fucking whispering the whole
02:41:19 time and you couldn't understand him.
02:41:21 Yeah, I think so.
02:41:23 So that guy again, I turned it up really loud.
02:41:25 It's just him.
02:41:27 Uh, he's so funny.
02:41:31 Can you tell what he's saying?
02:41:33 Uh, yeah, he's saying, oh, I see.
02:41:41 Cool.
02:41:43 Uh, the viewers will hear it next.
02:41:46 Next voicemail, Prince in the big city, three, three, two, one, go.
02:41:52 Why are there so many flags in this country?
02:41:57 What are they trying to tell me?
02:41:59 What are they trying to say?
02:42:02 Why are the flags in the metro station behind glass?
02:42:10 Let them out.
02:42:13 Let them out.
02:42:15 I don't, I don't know how to answer this.
02:42:18 Yeah.
02:42:18 Why, why are they behind glass?
02:42:22 They just keep them clean.
02:42:23 Let them out.
02:42:24 Other flags can't be out.
02:42:26 They've got to be kept safe from all the dirty leftists who are going to burn them down.
02:42:31 They put them in a nice frame to display them so that they don't get touched by dirty fucking tourists.
02:42:39 Dirty communist Europeans that come here and want to touch our flags.
02:42:43 I just wanted to put my greasy palms on their flag and I couldn't reach them.
02:42:48 I know.
02:42:48 That's what all you non-Americans want to do.
02:42:51 You just want to get your fingerprints all over stars and bars.
02:42:55 Oh, my God, you know, setting.
02:42:57 I have, I have like a beautiful like New Zealand flag, right?
02:43:01 So sadly, the flag design, we never got the change.
02:43:05 I was like, if we were in a house, I want to fly the New Zealand flag and the American flag together.
02:43:10 And I had to be warned.
02:43:13 I can't fly a New Zealand flag higher than the American one.
02:43:17 Or someone might just fucking shoot me and also it's against the law.
02:43:22 But wait, it's like there's a law about putting the American flag at the top.
02:43:28 Is it a Texas thing?
02:43:30 It's against the law for other flags to be flown higher than an American flag.
02:43:36 That is cool.
02:43:37 Very normal, normal.
02:43:38 I love small government.
02:43:40 It's so small, I can barely see it.
02:43:42 I love small, I love small government.
02:43:45 And that's why I like it that the big government
02:43:52 isn't telling the smaller state governments that they have to not
02:43:57 take our rights away, letting them, letting them, letting them ban abortion if they want to.
02:44:02 That's small government.
02:44:03 Small government is when federal government lets state government
02:44:08 ban you from doing things.
02:44:10 Yes, I'd put like a bunch of flags.
02:44:13 The trans flag at the top and a bunch of like other like LGBT flags.
02:44:18 And then the American flag right at the bottom, tracking in the mud.
02:44:24 It's like sliding all over the mud.
02:44:26 That's what I would do.
02:44:28 I'm going to take you, I'm going to take you out.
02:44:33 You can't fucking do this.
02:44:35 Is this a date?
02:44:36 You can't. No, this is a war.
02:44:40 The next voicemail is called it was Ben's Twitter banner from when they outlawed vaping three to one go.
02:44:52 The first panel of that comic was inspired like you saying that was inspired by
02:44:59 yes, your old Twitter banner.
02:45:02 The one where I'm squatting next to the I have been heard a song called
02:45:07 Dancing is not a crime.
02:45:09 The fire hydrant.
02:45:10 Unless you do it without me by panic at the disco.
02:45:17 And I see from that, I had this little parody idea in my mind.
02:45:24 Following the song, I guess, where it's like vaping, vaping, vaping is not a crime.
02:45:31 Unless you do it, do it, do it, do it, do it without me.
02:45:39 And the melody of the song follows.
02:45:43 I see.
02:45:46 I can never manage lyrics very well.
02:45:49 I just have that first day, the chorus.
02:45:52 No, I get you, man.
02:45:53 But yeah, deep cuts.
02:45:57 So I'm just so much too deep.
02:46:00 I don't know if this voicemail needed to be a minute nine, but thanks for the explanation.
02:46:07 Next one is called Candyman Ben.
02:46:13 Poston.
02:46:14 There it is.
02:46:15 OK, three, two, one, go.
02:46:18 Hey, Ben, just wanted to say that orange slice candy fucking delicious.
02:46:22 I think it's a noble pursuit to try and recreate it.
02:46:26 I do have a theory as far as how they're made.
02:46:29 I think that they basically just whip a bunch of fucking air into the syrup to create that texture.
02:46:37 And maybe if you, I don't know, used a mixer or just took a whisk and beat
02:46:42 the syrup as fast as you could while you're making it, you could probably get similar results.
02:46:48 I don't know.
02:46:48 I think it's worth a shot at the very least anyway.
02:46:50 Good luck with your candy making endeavors.
02:46:52 I think baking.
02:46:53 So I saw I found a recipe that called for baking soda.
02:46:57 I never I never tried putting it in there.
02:47:03 I did. I did manage to make some that were solid.
02:47:08 They were very hard.
02:47:09 They were very tough, not tough, but they were very solid and they really sticky.
02:47:15 But they didn't quite have the consistency I was looking for.
02:47:18 Baking soda might have improved it.
02:47:20 I kind of started.
02:47:22 I kind of changed my focus.
02:47:25 I might come back to that at some point.
02:47:27 Next one is a God.
02:47:29 We got another Prince of the Big City.
02:47:33 The Prince of the Big City episode.
02:47:36 This is episode four.
02:47:38 There's no subtitle.
02:47:40 Three, two, one, go.
02:47:42 So Ben mentioned on the last episode that he's thinking of getting on Tinder again.
02:47:48 But Ben, unfortunately, I am in Boston right now.
02:47:53 And I am on Tinder right now.
02:47:56 And what I'm going to do is take all of the hot girls
02:48:01 and take them with me back to the Netherlands.
02:48:05 And I will make sure that you never get laid.
02:48:08 And Boston will be for virgins and not for lovers.
02:48:17 That's that's just that's just the status quo.
02:48:21 Boston is for virgins.
02:48:23 That's just how it that's just you're telling me more of the same is coming.
02:48:27 And I'm ready for it.
02:48:30 Next one is called.
02:48:34 OK, there's an image link.
02:48:36 But here's the voicemail.
02:48:37 It's called Any Way Big News, three, two, one, go.
02:48:47 And here's the image.
02:48:50 It's back. Yes, a lobster.
02:48:57 Oh, it's lobster is back, I see.
02:49:00 This is this is another one from Prince.
02:49:03 This is Prince.
02:49:04 I think he might be lobster is back.
02:49:09 He might be reacting to Papageno's, which is he might have heard us talk about.
02:49:14 Me and Nate talk about that as like our favorite New England pizza chain.
02:49:21 Or one that we're familiar with, anyway, I was my favorite.
02:49:26 Anyway, lobsters back on the menu and it's never going away, baby.
02:49:30 OK, next one is a Vokeru link,
02:49:33 which I will get soon.
02:49:40 Download.
02:49:42 Showing folder, there we go.
02:49:46 Here it is. OK, no subtitle.
02:49:49 Three, two, one, go.
02:49:52 Hello, friends.
02:49:54 I have a very important message for you.
02:49:56 It's one come fixer.
02:49:58 You go very close to the microphone.
02:50:02 So you can hear a very important message.
02:50:04 OK, OK, yeah.
02:50:06 Closer, OK, closer.
02:50:09 Oh, it's a fake, you idiot.
02:50:11 I bought it at the party store.
02:50:14 It's not one day.
02:50:15 I don't know what to.
02:50:18 OK, you got us with a SpongeBob.
02:50:23 Is that a SpongeBob?
02:50:25 I think it was a sound like Patrick and then Squidward.
02:50:28 No, it didn't.
02:50:29 I thought that was like the stalker episode of the guy who was like going to kill
02:50:33 SpongeBob. What?
02:50:38 I just did not want to party.
02:50:40 I thought that was Squidward.
02:50:43 The I don't even listen.
02:50:45 I just will listen to L.S.
02:50:46 Mark explain all the episodes and I don't know what you're talking about.
02:50:50 So you don't even know every good attention.
02:50:54 Every single bit of dialogue from every episode.
02:50:58 By the time I read, I really got my seven hours worth out of that experience,
02:51:04 I guess. Anyway, that was the last voicemail
02:51:08 or the last one that I'm going to play because the rest are trash.
02:51:13 Oh, this guy, is this the
02:51:17 no, this isn't the thing I was talking about his mustache being a fake
02:51:21 that he bought at the party store.
02:51:23 He's been trying to kill SpongeBob this whole time and then he keeps going
02:51:25 interrupted. I'm pretty sure that's the plot of that episode.
02:51:28 I've been seeing, you know, that clown girl from
02:51:33 from a fucking ace, ace attorney.
02:51:37 Yes. Yeah.
02:51:38 I've been seeing a gift going around where, you know,
02:51:41 she she snaps her suspenders and the boobs pop and then SpongeBob
02:51:46 and Patrick go, they were fake.
02:51:49 And then some tough biker fish goes, of course, they were fake.
02:51:53 So I saw I saw that exact same thing you're talking about.
02:51:57 I've seen it posted a couple of times.
02:51:59 So that that's what that reminded me of, but it wasn't the same audio.
02:52:02 So I think it's just a coincidence.
02:52:04 I think I think that was that audio was from the SpongeBob movie.
02:52:09 With the I guess I just know my SpongeBob.
02:52:15 I haven't seen SpongeBob in like ten years, but I just have.
02:52:18 I saw it so many so many times as a kid.
02:52:21 I, you know, it's funny.
02:52:27 I had watched. Yeah, I watched it some as a kid.
02:52:30 I rewatched the first couple of seasons a few years ago.
02:52:34 And it's really funny.
02:52:36 I mean, I remember thinking on my rewatch, I remember getting to the end
02:52:41 of season three and being like, I already kind of feel the quality declining.
02:52:46 Like it already, like it's not bad yet, but it feels like it's getting worse.
02:52:50 And we're only in season three.
02:52:51 And then I watched the video and I watched that that video.
02:52:55 And Mark is like, yeah, like right at basically after season like three or four,
02:53:00 it like goes way off the deep end.
02:53:02 Like it gets immediately worse like right after that.
02:53:05 It's like, huh? Well, yeah, that's like that's the thing of most shows.
02:53:10 I usually after they hit 64 episodes, they start fucking up.
02:53:15 We usually after a third season, they start fucking up.
02:53:18 Simpsons is kind of an outlier and then it managed to last for quite a bit longer.
02:53:22 I know Simpsons is an outlier, but like I feel like SpongeBob is kind of
02:53:26 the Simpsons of its generation in that it's like to to an extent.
02:53:32 So I thought it would stay good longer.
02:53:35 They did free seasons and then a movie and then immediately after the movie,
02:53:39 like it was pretty like it was like a sharp turn downhill, I remember.
02:53:45 I remember the movie.
02:53:48 I don't think I've even watched a single full episode of SpongeBob,
02:53:51 but I saw the movies for some reason. Really? Really?
02:53:54 I've seen like clips. I've seen bits.
02:53:56 I've seen half of an episode.
02:53:58 I never watched it like at normal because it wasn't on TV.
02:54:02 So like the channels I could access.
02:54:05 Oh, that's so those are like only shows we could access in New Zealand, like consistently.
02:54:11 Was it not on British television?
02:54:13 It maybe was on satellite or something.
02:54:16 I didn't have Cartoon Network either.
02:54:20 I have Nickelodeon. I didn't have any of that.
02:54:22 I had like different things.
02:54:25 I had Dick and Dominic de Bungalow, which was great.
02:54:32 Yeah, you didn't have a you didn't have a Mega Man on the NES,
02:54:37 but you had a fucking Jet Set Willy on the ZX Spectrum.
02:54:42 So this is just as good.
02:54:45 Just as good. Yeah.
02:54:48 Now, that was like occasional like things of SpongeBob.
02:54:53 I just don't remember like.
02:54:56 Like ever being like around when it started.
02:55:01 I just I caught the end of an episode a couple of times.
02:55:05 I remember when it started airing and I watched, you know, the premiere
02:55:10 because I was a kid and I, you know, I would just watch it sometimes when it was on.
02:55:16 I guess I liked it well enough.
02:55:21 And I think, you know, then I kind of stop watching cartoons for as much
02:55:24 like when I went to college or whatever, like I didn't watch much TV.
02:55:28 And then I was surprised, you know, maybe in the last
02:55:31 in the last maybe probably less than 10 years, but in the last like five to 10 years,
02:55:38 the the sort of the dice of history
02:55:42 landed and it's like, yeah, SpongeBob was kind of like the like the show for
02:55:47 like Zoomer, the Zoomer generation.
02:55:50 Yeah, like like they all grew up watching it.
02:55:53 And I was like, huh, really?
02:55:55 That that show.
02:55:56 I mean, I guess I mean, I guess it's fine.
02:55:59 I like it. I like it fine.
02:56:01 I guess I never would have suspected that that would happen when it when it premiered.
02:56:08 Comparing SpongeBob to The Simpsons is very appropriate
02:56:10 because The Simpsons and SpongeBob are the only two.
02:56:14 No, they would be only two cartoons that like never stopped airing in New Zealand.
02:56:21 Pretty much I think SpongeBob must have started right when I was a kid,
02:56:23 because I think like right when I was like of television watching age,
02:56:27 because every time I would come home from school,
02:56:30 you turned to Channel Two and Studio Two would be on
02:56:33 and the presenters would talk about a funny thing
02:56:35 and then they would play an episode of SpongeBob and then like an episode of Yu-Gi-Oh.
02:56:38 And then you switched to Channel Free and Malcolm in the middle is is on.
02:56:42 And then after that is The Simpsons.
02:56:45 And that was like that was like it for like 10 years.
02:56:49 And it was only the first free season of SpongeBob.
02:56:52 What more do you need in SpongeBob, Yu-Gi-Oh, The Simpsons and Malcolm in the middle?
02:56:56 Well, Yu-Gi-Oh would occasionally swap out for something else.
02:56:58 It would be a SpongeBob and another show.
02:56:59 And then Channel Free was Malcolm in the middle for a long time,
02:57:03 but there was always The Simpsons and they would do reruns all the time.
02:57:08 Like the first free seasons of SpongeBob,
02:57:10 I must have seen at least like eight times because I was very familiar
02:57:14 with the order of the episodes would be in by the end.
02:57:16 Like I'm like, oh, next week is going to be the fucking Shanghai episode of the,
02:57:21 you know, they're on the flying Dutchmanship.
02:57:22 And after that, they'll be like this episode.
02:57:24 Like I mean, my sister would figure out and we'd like get excited
02:57:27 for the episodes coming up that we really liked and I know SpongeBob was good.
02:57:33 It's funny. It holds up the first few seasons anyway.
02:57:36 It's good.
02:57:39 Yeah, like I said, I watched them a couple of years ago.
02:57:42 And yeah, I mean, I only watched the first three seasons and they were all good.
02:57:46 That's good. Yeah. That's all you need.
02:57:48 Yeah.
02:57:49 Any UK heads in the audience, remember, Mona the Vampire?
02:57:54 Actually, that's familiar.
02:57:57 Mona the Vampire.
02:58:00 This is like all those like funny, like Canadian puppet shows.
02:58:05 Yeah, except I've never heard of but only Canadians know.
02:58:08 Yeah, there's the story of Tracy Beaker.
02:58:12 These are so fucking funny.
02:58:13 You're just you may I know you make some of these up like these.
02:58:16 I've never made anything up.
02:58:18 Dick and Dom in the in the bungalow is probably the funniest sound in one.
02:58:22 I can't be real. So real program.
02:58:25 No, it was great.
02:58:26 It's like you get a bunch of rowdy, like seven year olds, seven to not seven year
02:58:31 olds, like 10 to like 11, nine year olds, get them in a room.
02:58:37 And it's like a game show variety show with two like wacky zany
02:58:45 comedian guys who are in their early 20s, jumping around,
02:58:51 throwing custard pies at each other and all the kids are screaming.
02:58:56 And then they watch cartoons and there's like puppet shows
02:59:00 and like games and it's insane.
02:59:06 I loved it. It was my favorite show.
02:59:08 It came on every Saturday from nine to eleven.
02:59:12 Did you guys see some I think a guy who was in Black Panther
02:59:19 is like making a a dark and gritty Barney reboot.
02:59:25 Ah, yeah, stupid.
02:59:30 They already did that. It was called Deltarune.
02:59:36 Yeah, it seems like a project that shouldn't exist and maybe it won't.
02:59:41 But this saw the story going around Twitter.
02:59:45 The quote was like.
02:59:49 Oh. Oh, ew.
02:59:53 What? Oh, ew.
02:59:57 I think I just had a I think I just sped up a tonsil stone.
03:00:03 Ew.
03:00:05 It's a terrible.
03:00:07 That's that's terrible.
03:00:09 Oh, God, I hope that's not a new thing that's going to start happening for me.
03:00:16 Oh, and Yvonne Yvonne of the Yukon.
03:00:21 I was going to say something.
03:00:23 Wait, I have to say the quote of the Barney quote.
03:00:26 He was like, Barney asked us, like, won't you say you love me, too?
03:00:31 But what if that's what if that wasn't true?
03:00:35 I don't love you.
03:00:39 No, it's horrifying.
03:00:41 Doesn't necessarily imply hatred.
03:00:43 It's just sort of I thought music is coming out of your fucking speaker.
03:00:49 Give when you said you don't love me.
03:00:51 It was like like sad music started playing on my computer
03:00:54 and I thought it was going for this chord.
03:00:56 I clip that sell it to the to the highest bidder.
03:01:02 I sell it to fund the next Republican gubernatorial race.
03:01:08 It was just like the first sound of me saying, I don't love you.
03:01:11 And then the Republicans marching.
03:01:14 No, it was just the first six seconds of that video.
03:01:16 It just started playing randomly on what I don't know how it happened.
03:01:20 Some tab open and I click this.
03:01:25 Yeah, yeah, that's appropriate.
03:01:32 Well, that they should make a Barney reboot.
03:01:38 He says, I love you, but you don't like me.
03:01:42 I'll go gets his hat.
03:01:45 Wouldn't get the fuck out of here, Barney.
03:01:49 What a that's that's going to be me when I'm on Tinder after Prince
03:01:54 has taken all the all the cute girls back to Deutschland or whatever.
03:01:59 I might as well not even try, you know what?
03:02:04 I might as well just give up before even give it a shot.
03:02:07 Spare myself the spare myself the embarrassment.
03:02:10 Yeah, I think that's the move.
03:02:14 Now, you should you should give it into doing a Barney themed Tinder.
03:02:19 I think I think Nancy Reagan said, you know, failure.
03:02:23 It's not about how many times you get knocked down.
03:02:27 It's about how many times people see you doing it.
03:02:31 It's about how many times you get up again.
03:02:36 You're never going to keep me down.
03:02:40 Uh, OK, huh?
03:02:42 Oh, you were doing the tub thumping, tub, tub thumping.
03:02:47 No, it's tub thumping.
03:02:48 Chumbo Womba, Womba Chumba, right?
03:02:52 Is that Chumbo Womba?
03:02:54 I don't know. Yeah, it's tub thumping.
03:02:57 Yeah, yeah. I get knocked down.
03:03:00 That damn end of the song.
03:03:05 I don't know.
03:03:08 What were we talking about?
03:03:10 The last voicemail and before that, nothing.
03:03:15 There are no more.
03:03:16 Yes, they just refreshed.
03:03:16 There are no more voicemails.
03:03:18 Thank God.
03:03:20 I want to I want to talk about a little thing, though.
03:03:24 OK.
03:03:27 I talked to my therapist about like, I'm not doing anything.
03:03:31 It's hard.
03:03:33 No, it's hard to not want to be doing stuff.
03:03:37 Uh-huh.
03:03:39 And she got me on.
03:03:41 I mean, can you be any more specific?
03:03:44 It's just like I want to get back into drawing, I guess.
03:03:47 I've got I've got commissions to do.
03:03:48 I've got stuff to draw.
03:03:50 OK, I need to do them by golly.
03:03:54 That's yeah.
03:03:55 And she got me on this thing
03:03:57 where she was telling me to get a piece of paper and a pen
03:04:00 and to like, like she knows I have characters.
03:04:04 So she told me to draw some characters, like, I mean, sure.
03:04:07 But like, where is this going?
03:04:09 OK.
03:04:09 And I then she asked me questions like,
03:04:14 so what are they doing with each other?
03:04:15 They just stand in there and make them interact with each other.
03:04:18 And I'm like, I guess this character does this.
03:04:21 It went on like that for a while.
03:04:23 I really didn't know what the point was
03:04:26 because it was like, it's eating into my therapy time.
03:04:30 But by the end,
03:04:33 it was like the point was that
03:04:37 forcing yourself to do to get work done
03:04:41 feels the same way as somebody just asking you to do it.
03:04:45 Hmm.
03:04:47 And it's but you have to be the one to do the asking.
03:04:49 And I was like, oh, cool.
03:04:51 Like, that's actually like good advice.
03:04:54 Wait, it was smart.
03:04:56 Someone getting work done feels the same way
03:05:00 as someone asking you to do.
03:05:02 Well, when when you don't want to do work
03:05:05 and it's like, I can put it off like, I don't want to do it yet, not now.
03:05:10 Hmm.
03:05:12 Having.
03:05:14 Having another person
03:05:16 shove you into it is like very useful.
03:05:20 And it's like so it's like you can be that person to yourself.
03:05:24 Yeah, I don't know how to do that yet,
03:05:26 but like it was a way of thinking about it.
03:05:28 It was like pretty good.
03:05:30 It's also why like writers rooms are so much more productive
03:05:33 than a writer sitting in by themselves with a typewriter
03:05:36 just trying to think of stuff.
03:05:38 And like you got to bounce ideas off.
03:05:40 That's why that that works.
03:05:42 Like it's like if this is like someone.
03:05:46 This is why for years,
03:05:48 I found that the best way for me to be productive is to get
03:05:51 to sit in a call with other creative people and just vibe,
03:05:55 which is why when we work, which is why it works.
03:05:59 It works if if you're on a good time zone thing with them.
03:06:05 I tried to do that.
03:06:06 But everyone I know is like only awake when I'm about to go to bed.
03:06:11 I'm only around for a call when I'm about to go to bed.
03:06:15 I'm like if like it's like if someone else asked you
03:06:21 to draw something, you would do it.
03:06:24 You'd be like, OK, OK, well, I guess I'll figure out.
03:06:28 It's yeah, I guess I'll figure out a way to do it.
03:06:31 Yeah, it's not as simple as that.
03:06:33 But like it's the it's the fact that like I hadn't drawn in such a long time
03:06:39 and drawing the doodles, it started with something that didn't matter at all.
03:06:45 Draw anything is what she said, get a piece of paper, draw anything.
03:06:50 Yeah.
03:06:50 And then it's sort of like accelerated from there into
03:06:55 what is essentially a series of panels of two characters interacting
03:07:01 or three characters.
03:07:03 Oh, like like like some kind of comic or so like so some kind of comic.
03:07:07 And I'm like, man, it really is very easy to make these things
03:07:11 like to sketch this stuff out.
03:07:14 Yeah. It's the only thing holding me back is my desire to not do it.
03:07:20 And it's it's such a powerful desire.
03:07:24 But like it's it doesn't make any sense.
03:07:27 Like I could I could draw that so easily.
03:07:30 I think that the difficulty was starting is that.
03:07:34 I want to plan it out and throwing myself into the work
03:07:40 allowed me to get it done, even though I didn't know what it was at first
03:07:44 because it was just like an exercise.
03:07:46 But like that's something I need to get better at is throwing myself into work
03:07:50 without a plan.
03:07:52 So that, yeah, so that I can get my, you know, my my momentum going.
03:07:57 And it's like, OK, well, now I'm working, now I've warmed up.
03:08:03 Now I can actually like think in terms of art
03:08:07 and maybe I can sketch a page or something.
03:08:10 That's kind of like how, you know, even if you don't know what you're going to do,
03:08:16 like just doing something like just opening the program or whatever is like,
03:08:22 OK, you just you just like I don't know what I'm going to draw,
03:08:25 but I'm going to open the drawing program.
03:08:29 And I'm not going to worry about what happens after that,
03:08:31 but I'm going to take that step right now.
03:08:33 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:08:36 How I've gone to work recently is I just throw myself into my Patreon server
03:08:40 and do the Hangout channel.
03:08:41 I I ping the role for my patrons who like want to be notified when I'm hanging out
03:08:48 and they pop in and then I work for like four hours and I get a lot done.
03:08:52 And I'm going to start doing that twice twice a day, starting tomorrow.
03:08:58 What are you working in the morning?
03:08:59 Four hours at night, just drawing or animating or whatever I need to get done.
03:09:06 I want to be productive.
03:09:07 And I also want to invite more friends in there, too,
03:09:11 because if there's not enough patrons around,
03:09:13 I know it's good to have access to friends who can hang if they're available.
03:09:17 Yeah, both of you could get in if you wanted, I could just pop you right in
03:09:21 if that sounds like a time or not.
03:09:25 Sure. I mean, I mean, so I mean, so many servers,
03:09:30 but I'd I'll I'll accept I'll accept an invitation.
03:09:35 Of course, my nighttime stream would be would typically start
03:09:39 about an hour or two from now and my morning stream would start
03:09:45 let's see, like six and a half hours ago.
03:09:48 I could catch a morning stream.
03:09:51 Yeah, I could.
03:09:53 Yeah, I'll take that.
03:09:55 Epic throw me in there.
03:09:57 I'll throw you right in.
03:09:59 I'll give you the art friend role.
03:10:02 I I found this tweet the other day.
03:10:09 I liked it.
03:10:11 It's like a bunch of.
03:10:14 You know, we got this little artist here saying like each one,
03:10:19 he's like he's facing a problem and he's he has an unproductive way
03:10:25 of thinking about it versus like a productive way of thinking about it.
03:10:29 Like this first one is not I need to be in a better mood before I will draw,
03:10:35 but I will be in a better mood if I draw.
03:10:39 Right. Yeah, true.
03:10:41 That's true. Yeah.
03:10:43 It's so true.
03:10:45 These are pretty good.
03:10:48 I like in your server, there's a self there's a role self assign.
03:10:52 And if you want the horny, there's lots of people who click yes.
03:10:58 They want the horny role, please.
03:11:00 I would do access for first posting channels, because people were first
03:11:04 posting everywhere and I had to contain them.
03:11:07 Well, well.
03:11:09 Mm, that's that doesn't surprise me so much.
03:11:18 Also, those comments you linked are unironically based.
03:11:21 I'm going to hold on to that.
03:11:23 Yeah, right. I thought they were great.
03:11:29 I had to go through my Twitter likes.
03:11:31 I need to be in a better mood.
03:11:33 I need to be in a better mood to draw.
03:11:34 That's always that's why I get like nothing done for like eight hours
03:11:37 after I wake up.
03:11:39 Yeah.
03:11:42 Yeah. Yeah.
03:11:43 I've I've been there 20 times.
03:11:50 Well, I'm glad you like that.
03:11:51 I had to go through.
03:11:52 I had to go back through my Twitter likes for a few days to find them,
03:11:55 but I did.
03:11:56 That's great.
03:11:57 I hope to be making progress
03:12:02 on one of my comics, probably Clarissa.
03:12:07 Soon ish.
03:12:09 I don't know when I want to hope that I also hope that I am.
03:12:17 I am hoping to hear back from this this printer lady.
03:12:22 I'm hoping to very soon be done with this stupid fucking book
03:12:28 formatting job and send that off.
03:12:31 And then as I wait for them to send me the test print,
03:12:36 then I can get back to working on that video that I was excited about.
03:12:42 That's my plan.
03:12:45 That's a good plan.
03:12:46 I know. Thank you.
03:12:48 Hell, yeah.
03:12:50 Wait a minute.
03:12:51 I got to share another tweet.
03:12:53 You got to share another one.
03:12:56 It's a it's this one.
03:12:59 He's practicing the Among Us alphabet.
03:13:02 And as you can see, oh, my God, all the.
03:13:06 Fucking volume wouldn't appear.
03:13:08 Sorry. I'm sorry.
03:13:09 Yeah, I didn't realize it had a sound.
03:13:14 The sound adds a lot, but I couldn't access the volume.
03:13:19 Yeah, I mean, I I like the Q on the S.
03:13:23 The S looks like a worm.
03:13:25 Some of these are better than the O is the best one.
03:13:28 I like the V. The V is just upside down.
03:13:33 Yeah.
03:13:35 A is just the boy.
03:13:41 You is you.
03:13:42 There's an upside down grade.
03:13:43 These are great.
03:13:44 Look at these. This is delightful.
03:13:49 Oh, what do we got here?
03:13:50 Plomocus.
03:13:53 I just don't mind because of a song.
03:13:56 Jesus, that's fuck.
03:14:02 Literally.
03:14:03 Yikes.
03:14:05 You came back from the dead.
03:14:08 Well, oh, it counted.
03:14:11 Oh, it counted down.
03:14:12 Counted down.
03:14:14 Oh, I didn't even like register that.
03:14:18 I just thought it was like a really distressing like
03:14:21 lots of people kill themselves in one word.
03:14:23 Just did it.
03:14:25 No, so it's like oh, I see.
03:14:29 I see. Excellent.
03:14:30 That this is a good reaction image
03:14:32 when you're sad and something cool happens.
03:14:35 Yeah, exactly.
03:14:37 Don't don't be a statistic.
03:14:40 Oh, shit, like turn the clock back like me when I play
03:14:43 that new Cuphead deal.
03:14:45 See, I haven't played it yet.
03:14:46 I should get on that.
03:14:50 I haven't been playing video games.
03:14:54 I've been I've been playing games today.
03:14:58 I dual played Adventure Quest and RuneScape at the same time.
03:15:04 Now, that's productivity.
03:15:06 That's shitty games in one.
03:15:08 Even though they're neither shitty, they just are great.
03:15:11 And I love them.
03:15:12 How are you in the early 2000s twice at the same time?
03:15:16 Because the technology exists late 2000s.
03:15:20 I've always respected Jagex for like just giving the player
03:15:24 base what they wanted and making old school RuneScape
03:15:27 a permanent thing that they will upkeep.
03:15:30 Yes, because they asked for it.
03:15:33 I like it when my character has a triangle for a face.
03:15:38 Yes, they're so stupid looking.
03:15:42 It's it's a perfect.
03:15:45 My name is Five Polygon Man.
03:15:49 And I have a Five Polygon plan.
03:15:55 My tonsil is sore.
03:15:57 I wonder if there's anything to do with that tonsil stone that just.
03:16:01 Yes hurts a little bit and I don't like it.
03:16:06 Don't like not knowing what's going on.
03:16:10 With stuff, especially inside of me.
03:16:14 Better cut your open and find out.
03:16:19 Or get a tiny submarine shrink shrink people down
03:16:22 to go inside your body and look around.
03:16:27 Why didn't I think of that?
