00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:07 the best guy ever, et cetera, et cetera. We got Gibbontake over there.
00:00:12 Hey guys, go to Gibbontake.site to read the Lord of Ghosts comic. It's good and you should
00:00:17 like it and you should read it. Yeah, it's good. It is good. I'm all proud of it.
00:00:22 I am its biggest fan. I am the most known best ghost of the Lord of Ghosts comic. That's
00:00:28 its defining characteristic. We've also got a creator of new video game, Tom.
00:00:34 Yo, go to tomolver.itch.io slash ninja suffering to play ninja suffering.
00:00:41 Indeed. But can someone acquiring all those big juicy boigas really be said to be suffering?
00:00:46 These are the questions of our time. I don't know. You eventually die, so.
00:00:49 I guess that's true. Just like real life. Indeed.
00:00:52 Speaking of dying, Endless Jess, good to see you buddy.
00:00:55 Hey guys, I'm here this week, so that means we get to talk about the Final Fantasy 7.
00:01:02 All right. All right. I'm opening up another tab. I'm going to start up an audiobook or
00:01:06 something. It's it's funny. You guys say that somebody messaged me on Discord yesterday and was
00:01:12 like, you know, I just want to tell you the last like four episodes of PCP have sucked.
00:01:17 I hate to talk about Final Fantasy 7. Funny. I feel the exact same way.
00:01:22 If we can certainly talk about that. I'm bored. I never want to talk about it again.
00:01:30 What do you know? Talk about Ninja Suffering, the better video game.
00:01:33 Sure. Sure. Hey, here's the thing, Tom.
00:01:38 And me and me, Ben Saint, patreon.com slash Ben Saint. I'm the last one.
00:01:41 Okay. Right. Yeah. I won't even like watch videos about it anymore. Like I see
00:01:46 like guys who like normal under normal circumstances. I'd be like, hey, that guy did a review,
00:01:50 but now it's like, no, no more. I'm done. Everyone's talked about it. No, I've talked about it.
00:01:54 No more. No more truly exhausted by the discussion. However, unfortunately for me,
00:01:59 I am in the middle of my own labor by Sisyphean task to articulate my full thoughts. Right.
00:02:06 It is a struggle of the critics. I have been thinking very strongly about undertaking
00:02:11 a similar labor. However, because I have other things on my plate at the moment,
00:02:16 sure. I've put it to the side and also I'm thinking maybe that's better because then
00:02:20 if and when I ever actually do it enough time will have passed that the market will not be
00:02:25 as flooded. Yeah, that's true. That's that would be a good thing. I think people are waiting a
00:02:29 little bit for like, I don't know, whenever like a new video game comes out and I find it interesting
00:02:34 and people talk about it, there at some point there comes a time when the definitive video has
00:02:38 been published by someone like a, I don't know, like a Matthew Matosis review of Dark Souls 2.
00:02:44 That's also my fear is that the longer I wait, the more chance there's going to be for like a
00:02:48 nine hour Matthew Matosis come out and fucking I give up forever.
00:02:52 Matthew Matosis would stoop so low as to play Final Fantasy 7.
00:02:56 I certainly hope not. He's smarter than that. Hey, you know, I did beat the true Super Boss the
00:03:02 other day. And so I finally, I did that thing. It was kind of fun. Kind of fun. Okay. Well,
00:03:08 that's interesting. Right. Well, wait, wait, I've got a breaking breaking news. I have just a piece
00:03:12 of breaking news. We don't have to discuss long, but it's that so right as I was doing the voicemails
00:03:16 before we started this very episode of the PCP, it appears there was a shooting in front of the
00:03:22 apartment building next to my house. I heard a loud rat, tat, tat, tat. And as I do, I'm just like,
00:03:28 Oh, I assume that's just bangs and pops as I hear in my neighborhood. I always think it sounds like
00:03:33 a gunshot, but I never really know. I thought I thought shootings didn't happen anymore. It's
00:03:38 It's only coronavirus news now.
00:03:41 Maybe they shot coronavirus bots.
00:03:44 That's what the news is telling me.
00:03:46 All the things that we thought were problems
00:03:48 are no longer problems.
00:03:49 This is the real problem, guys.
00:03:51 We're serious this time.
00:03:53 This is clearly a case of cabin fever.
00:03:55 They're going haywire.
00:03:56 I have no idea what happened.
00:03:58 I did run over to the building after a while.
00:04:01 There were a bunch of cop cars.
00:04:02 There's like 10 cops, I don't know,
00:04:03 like six, seven cops swirling around.
00:04:05 I have no idea what's going on.
00:04:06 I looked for people who are dead.
00:04:09 I did not see anything.
00:04:11 I didn't see any ambulances or anything.
00:04:13 But that did happen.
00:04:14 And good ol' Sensi.
00:04:16 I love living in the ghetto.
00:04:18 It's great.
00:04:18 It's great.
00:04:19 That's all.
00:04:20 Okay, well, moving on from video game talk
00:04:24 to real video game talk.
00:04:25 Real video game talk.
00:04:26 Tom, Izumi the burger eater.
00:04:32 I played it a bunch of times,
00:04:34 but sometimes burgers don't appear
00:04:38 and I run out of stamina and that feels unfair.
00:04:40 How does the burger algorithm work?
00:04:42 How do you decide when and where they appear?
00:04:46 That's probably the biggest problem with the game right now
00:04:49 is just that they spawn every five to eight seconds
00:04:51 at a random Y location.
00:04:54 So the platforms and the burgers use two separate,
00:04:59 I guess, equations, but they're like baby equations.
00:05:01 I don't know how to do math.
00:05:03 And they just spawn in different locations.
00:05:04 And so the way the game works right now
00:05:05 is that it's just the same three platforms
00:05:08 over and over again.
00:05:09 Just when they get to the other side of the screen,
00:05:11 they just instantly teleport back to the other side
00:05:14 at a random Y value.
00:05:16 So it kind of gives the illusion that you're moving somewhere,
00:05:19 but you're actually just staying still
00:05:20 and things are scrolling.
00:05:22 So then there's a separate piece of code
00:05:25 that controls the burger spawns.
00:05:27 I was considering for a while to possibly make it more
00:05:31 like Dark Souls and have burgers be something
00:05:34 that you start with three of them
00:05:35 and you can just use them whenever, kind of like S this.
00:05:39 But I wanted to very much have it be a one button game
00:05:42 that you could play on anything.
00:05:43 And I couldn't think of a good way
00:05:45 of integrating something like that
00:05:48 without having to put another button or something.
00:05:51 So I kind of just said, I guess we'll leave the thing as is.
00:05:56 And if anybody like Gib asks me why the burger spawns,
00:05:59 so shit, I'd be like,
00:06:00 well the game's called Ninja's Soffering,
00:06:01 it's all about the inevitability
00:06:03 of like life first purpose proposal.
00:06:05 Yeah, but it's like, I play the game and I'm like,
00:06:08 I hear Jack's blade has like a billion points
00:06:11 and I'm like, okay, let's see if I can get a billion points.
00:06:14 And it just seems like luck.
00:06:15 It seems like luck if you get the right burger spawns.
00:06:18 There is some R and G.
00:06:19 Well, sorry, my high score was like 500, 600.
00:06:23 So I'm feeling pretty good about that.
00:06:26 Is your complaint Gib that the burgers just spawn
00:06:28 in almost impossible to reach spots
00:06:30 or that they simply don't appear at all?
00:06:31 No, not necessarily impossible to reach,
00:06:32 although that sometimes is a problem.
00:06:34 It just sort of feels like I can go for too long
00:06:38 without seeing a burger and like I'm playing perfectly well.
00:06:41 I'm like jumping, not losing that much stamina,
00:06:44 but I just don't get a burger in time before I die.
00:06:47 And I'm like, yeah.
00:06:48 But you said Tom, they appear every what,
00:06:50 five to eight seconds?
00:06:51 Is that still true?
00:06:52 Or is it just like you're getting a lot of eight second ones
00:06:55 and it's just fucking over?
00:06:55 Yeah, maybe, maybe I'm getting a lot of eight seconds.
00:06:56 I think the thing is, from what I understand,
00:06:59 like the reason it feels like it takes so much longer
00:07:02 is that every 100 points, the game speeds up.
00:07:05 So once you get to like five or 600 points,
00:07:06 you're doing way more jumps
00:07:08 because the game's moving faster
00:07:09 in those five to eight seconds.
00:07:11 So the longer you go, the less, the same amount of time,
00:07:15 like physical time is passing,
00:07:17 but you're doing a lot more platforming
00:07:18 because everything's moving at a higher speed.
00:07:20 That makes sense.
00:07:21 Yeah, it's more of the story is get good.
00:07:23 It is like Dark Souls.
00:07:24 No.
00:07:26 No RNG in it.
00:07:27 It's all about your own reaction time.
00:07:30 Like it, it's, there's no like, oh.
00:07:33 Oh, there's some RNG.
00:07:34 Will that guy's weapon clip through the wall
00:07:36 that yours bounces off of
00:07:37 when you're trying to dodge out of a room?
00:07:39 It's up to chance.
00:07:41 You just have to know which enemies have Vorpal weapons,
00:07:43 which is all of them.
00:07:44 Yeah.
00:07:45 You don't ever.
00:07:45 Yeah, I love them.
00:07:46 Remember Vorpal weapons guys?
00:07:47 I do.
00:07:48 Fucking sick.
00:07:49 What did they do?
00:07:50 It's like sometimes you press the S.
00:07:51 They instantly cut off your head if you crit.
00:07:53 They were the best.
00:07:54 Wait, in Dark Souls?
00:07:56 No, Dungeons and Dragons.
00:07:57 Dungeons and Dragons.
00:07:58 Oh, okay, okay, okay.
00:07:59 Right.
00:08:00 Vorpal weapons are stupid, by the way.
00:08:01 I fucking hate them.
00:08:02 Dungeons and Bunions.
00:08:04 I just started playing D&D again.
00:08:07 Oh, hell yeah.
00:08:08 I got roped into it.
00:08:09 I am a frog.
00:08:11 Dope.
00:08:14 That's it?
00:08:15 Like, like.
00:08:15 Dude, it's sick.
00:08:17 I'm a little dark frog, man.
00:08:19 Dude, frog heck of standing habitant?
00:08:19 Fuck yeah.
00:08:20 Dude, that's what I'm talking about.
00:08:22 He's a brewer.
00:08:23 He was like a folk hero.
00:08:24 He was like a folk hero from his hometown of the pond, right?
00:08:28 Like, it's all about the pond,
00:08:29 but he's like the town hero
00:08:30 because he led a water strike, right?
00:08:34 He led basically a hunger strike, but for water,
00:08:36 he led a hunger strike, a water strike to protest imperialism,
00:08:40 but from the dry folk.
00:08:42 And now he's their fucking champion
00:08:44 of their shitty little pond with like a hundred people in it.
00:08:46 But he's the coolest one of those like
00:08:48 shitty little hundred people.
00:08:50 And now he's finds himself whisked away
00:08:53 to this fucking magic cave that he can't get out of
00:08:55 and it's a struggle because he needs water.
00:08:57 And if he doesn't bathe in water for one hour a day
00:09:00 for six days, he'll die.
00:09:01 So the first game, which is all about like finding a wizard
00:09:05 and being like, how much will can I pay you
00:09:06 to please just make me a tub of water?
00:09:08 Please conjure a tub of water for me so I can live.
00:09:12 And it worked.
00:09:13 Worked like a charm.
00:09:14 If he was stuck in a desert, would he, A,
00:09:16 and he had to acquire water and there wasn't any around,
00:09:18 would he either try to find an enemy
00:09:21 and bleed them and use their blood
00:09:23 or would he try to hurt their feelings
00:09:25 and collect their tears
00:09:26 as that is a superior water source?
00:09:28 Probably blood, but the thing is he can't,
00:09:30 he doesn't, just drinking, it's not enough.
00:09:32 He has to bathe in it.
00:09:34 Okay, so we need to kill a lot of people.
00:09:35 He needs to really get ambitious.
00:09:37 No, he needs to manipulate, like upset a lot of people.
00:09:41 He needs to troll a lot of people, make them cry.
00:09:45 A true Pakistani note.
00:09:48 He's like frog Jesus, basically.
00:09:51 He is a God among frogs.
00:09:56 Someone was asking him about,
00:09:58 tell us about the history of your world
00:09:59 and the DM was like, just improv it.
00:10:01 And I was like, well, everyone knows
00:10:02 that the world started 60 years ago with the great flood
00:10:05 that created the entire pond.
00:10:10 What else was there before the pond?
00:10:11 Doesn't matter, it's not important.
00:10:14 I was thinking today,
00:10:16 I've had sort of weird annoying mind fog.
00:10:20 I was just like pacing around my room just thinking,
00:10:22 but like nothing was, like neurons were like trying to fire,
00:10:25 but there was no, nothing in the chamber.
00:10:29 I was trying to think of world building and characters,
00:10:31 but I was only just thinking of those words.
00:10:33 I wasn't actually doing anything creative.
00:10:35 World building and characters.
00:10:37 I was imagining, like thinking of stock footage
00:10:40 of people writing on laptops
00:10:42 and like people sitting down at desks to write.
00:10:44 And I'm like, that's me right now, but I'm not doing it.
00:10:46 And I don't know what's going wrong with my brain.
00:10:48 I think I might have dementia.
00:10:50 I think I might be going to die soon.
00:10:52 I just wanted to think of something creative.
00:10:56 It was really annoying.
00:10:57 I couldn't think of anything.
00:10:58 You just have to think creatively.
00:11:03 Oh, sorry.
00:11:04 I also experienced constant brain fog.
00:11:08 I have a D&D story to go with Ben's.
00:11:11 Yeah. Oh, fuck.
00:11:12 It's like this one time, a couple of years ago,
00:11:15 I started playing D&D with like a group of people that I know.
00:11:19 Because I had never done it before.
00:11:20 And I was like, this will be cool.
00:11:21 So I meet this D&D group and like only one of them
00:11:23 I actually know and the rest are like her friends.
00:11:26 So we're playing D&D.
00:11:28 It's me and my old secretary, if you remember her.
00:11:31 Oh, of course.
00:11:31 So we were playing D&D and so I was making my guy
00:11:35 and I made a guy called Bartholomundus
00:11:38 who is like a dragonborn monk.
00:11:42 But I, so he's like a lizard man.
00:11:44 And I just played him as Donatello.
00:11:46 And I would do the voice for like the whole session.
00:11:51 And it was awesome because like I would take
00:11:55 completely insane risks
00:11:56 and do the most retarded shit imaginable
00:11:59 that was like bound to get the whole party killed.
00:12:02 And it was like really frustrating everyone.
00:12:04 And like one guy in particular was like really mad.
00:12:06 And he was even more mad because like everything I did,
00:12:09 even though it was like the stupidest possible decision,
00:12:11 I would like roll a 20 every time.
00:12:13 And like it would work out great.
00:12:15 And this guy, he like thought he was like
00:12:18 the king shit of the D&D group.
00:12:21 He was, and he was like, I'm a bard
00:12:25 cause I'm a ladies man.
00:12:27 And I seduce all the women cause I'm a real charming.
00:12:32 And you could tell this man was not a ladies man in real life.
00:12:36 Of course.
00:12:37 He was like the stereotypical D&D player.
00:12:40 Like all the things that could be wrong with a human male.
00:12:45 At once.
00:12:46 But he, for...
00:12:48 Such as being a woman, for instance.
00:12:51 But for the purposes of the game, he wanted to be a bard.
00:12:54 And he was like really like,
00:12:55 he was really like playing it up.
00:12:57 Like he had a voice too.
00:12:58 And he was like in character the whole time.
00:12:59 And he was like trying to like swagger and be confident.
00:13:02 And all right.
00:13:04 So he's the bard.
00:13:04 And he's like trying to seduce all the characters.
00:13:06 Was Donatello doing the rapey stuff?
00:13:08 Alongside that?
00:13:09 No, I wasn't doing rapey stuff.
00:13:12 Donatello was a rapist.
00:13:13 Bartholomundus is not.
00:13:14 That is the one key difference between these two characters.
00:13:16 I see.
00:13:18 Yeah.
00:13:19 He was just like,
00:13:20 he was so like,
00:13:21 this is like I'm gonna be the coolest guy in the D&D party.
00:13:24 But like I became like really popular in this group.
00:13:27 Like by the end of the first night,
00:13:28 everyone loved me because I was fucking funny
00:13:30 and I was doing stupid Donatello shit.
00:13:32 And like all my dumb plans were working out successfully.
00:13:35 And he was over here like trying to be a bard
00:13:36 and seduce people.
00:13:38 And like all of his like cool ideas just didn't matter
00:13:40 compared to my complete retardation.
00:13:42 And he was getting more and more frustrated.
00:13:44 And that's the story.
00:13:46 It just, I ruined his entire D&D experience,
00:13:50 but I had a great experience.
00:13:51 The struggle between like the D&D veteran
00:13:54 who's really interested in like playing their character
00:13:56 seriously and immersing in the lore versus just,
00:13:59 I guess it would be the Chad doesn't give a fuck
00:14:02 about the setting or characters or anything.
00:14:05 Like I would be,
00:14:06 I feel bad except that I don't
00:14:08 cause he was a fucking jerk.
00:14:10 And he was like really smug and elitist about everything.
00:14:13 And I enjoyed ruining his time with my antics.
00:14:16 I understand that.
00:14:17 It's just that I've been that guy too many times
00:14:20 and it feels bad to reflect on how everyone hates you.
00:14:23 Okay, actually it was only one time
00:14:25 when I D&D'd in college.
00:14:26 I know I've talked about this like years ago,
00:14:28 but I made my one campaign and I planned like,
00:14:31 you know as I do,
00:14:32 I planned like every detail of the entire setting
00:14:35 and it was about like two brothers or something,
00:14:37 one of which like was involved
00:14:39 in like a demon summoning plant
00:14:40 or demon summoning fucking ritual or whatever
00:14:44 to like gain power over his brother
00:14:45 who he was like rivals with or whatever.
00:14:47 Like I don't know,
00:14:48 fucking Saban and Edgar from Final Fantasy VI,
00:14:51 but I don't know evil and dark or whatever.
00:14:53 And so I like sprinkled clues throughout,
00:14:55 like, whoa, there's like a corpse of a demon here.
00:14:56 That shouldn't be here.
00:14:57 Like some Dark Souls world building in my head.
00:15:00 And I mean, I don't know,
00:15:01 it went along fine until at the very end I had laid,
00:15:03 ooh, in my master plan,
00:15:05 I had laid all these hints that like,
00:15:07 while of course you could go for the bad ending
00:15:09 and kill the demonic brother,
00:15:11 I in my infinite wisdom as DM had sprinkled
00:15:13 tons of details throughout that he was actually savable.
00:15:16 If only you would try to negotiate with him.
00:15:18 He would renege on his good ways
00:15:20 and you could get the true good ending.
00:15:22 But then my fat friend Mike was just like,
00:15:24 fuck that shit dude.
00:15:26 And he fucking snapped his neck
00:15:28 and the worst part was that I got visibly mad.
00:15:31 And I said, well, you killed the Lord,
00:15:33 you get nothing, you get no rewards,
00:15:36 you leave the castle, you leave the kingdom,
00:15:38 you get nothing for this.
00:15:40 You ruined the good time,
00:15:41 you ruined my master fleet constructed core.
00:15:44 Yeah, that was odd.
00:15:45 Why would you do that, Mike?
00:15:46 This guy was so mad that he couldn't have his little
00:15:48 like alpha male fantasy of like being the Bard character
00:15:51 because I was too busy making the game fun.
00:15:54 And like, he was the only one who was mad.
00:15:58 Like he was just sitting there like stewing over it,
00:16:01 like for like four nights in a row,
00:16:03 he would stew it every time I did anything.
00:16:05 And everyone else was like laughing and having a good time.
00:16:08 And like, it's not like I was being like
00:16:10 deliberately disrespectful to the lore
00:16:12 or the story or the game or whatever.
00:16:14 I was just like, well,
00:16:15 and like, it wasn't even my fault that the character
00:16:17 ended up like a weird Donatello type
00:16:19 because I just, I'm like, okay, I'll make a lizard man
00:16:22 because lizard men are cool.
00:16:23 And this is his name.
00:16:24 And like, as I started playing like,
00:16:26 I just like, it's just my sense of humor
00:16:28 and I was just making people laugh.
00:16:29 And like, it started out,
00:16:31 he was just getting mad at me just for being funny.
00:16:34 And so the more mad at me he got,
00:16:36 the more funny I got.
00:16:38 And so he kind of created his own monster
00:16:40 because the more funny I got, the more powerful I got,
00:16:43 and the more stupid my character became
00:16:45 in response to his visible frustration.
00:16:48 And so he did it to himself.
00:16:51 And eventually it just, I don't know,
00:16:53 I thought it turned out great.
00:16:54 Like I had a great time.
00:16:55 I had a great first D&D experience.
00:16:57 The point of D&D is to have fun at the end of the day.
00:16:59 I made friends who I never spoke to
00:17:01 or cared about seeing again, but friends nonetheless.
00:17:03 Indeed.
00:17:04 Which are the best kind of friends you can have.
00:17:06 So there you go.
00:17:08 The moral of the story, kids is just be cool.
00:17:12 Which you can do by going to teespring.com
00:17:15 slash whatever it is by the just being cool T-shirt.
00:17:18 I rolled my character's name randomly.
00:17:21 And by that I mean, I literally rolled like,
00:17:23 I had a consonant dice and a vowel dice
00:17:25 and I just rolled that shit
00:17:27 and just went with whatever it was.
00:17:29 And the name that it came up with
00:17:31 was Higgs Ozoks.
00:17:34 And I thought that was pretty fucking based.
00:17:36 Higgs Ozoks the Dry.
00:17:40 Who ironically you said is a brewer?
00:17:43 He is a, yes.
00:17:44 And I was gonna have him be a woodcarver
00:17:45 because I sort of wanted him to be frog Jesus.
00:17:48 But I was like, it would be ironic if he's,
00:17:50 if he had, because when you're a folk hero,
00:17:52 you gotta have some like humble profession
00:17:54 that you come from.
00:17:55 And one of the options was brewer.
00:17:56 And I was like, that would be pretty funny
00:17:58 if he was the dry, but he made booze.
00:18:01 Okay.
00:18:02 That's one of the intellectuals in the crowd.
00:18:04 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:18:05 If you really think about it,
00:18:06 you might ascertain some significance,
00:18:10 some juxtaposition of concepts there.
00:18:14 But I doubt it.
00:18:14 Have you ever played D&D?
00:18:15 I know Tom has, I think we played together once.
00:18:17 Oh no, we just did more games.
00:18:18 I never did a D&D that had stats.
00:18:21 I did that one campaign with Munchy
00:18:23 and a bunch of other people
00:18:25 that didn't really go very far,
00:18:27 where I was playing,
00:18:28 we were playing in like a Scandinavian like fantasy land.
00:18:33 And I was playing like a crippled boy
00:18:35 who had found like a Boston Dynamics robot.
00:18:39 Like ancient technology, Boston Dynamics.
00:18:41 And he had tried, like his quest was to try
00:18:43 and like save it from like shutting down
00:18:46 because it needed batteries.
00:18:47 And they don't know what the fuck batteries are.
00:18:49 And so he, like he has no legs.
00:18:51 And the Boston Dynamic robot is like his legs.
00:18:54 And that was a pretty cool character.
00:18:56 I really liked that.
00:18:56 But they never really went anywhere.
00:19:00 That we didn't really get to a point
00:19:01 where we were having adventures.
00:19:02 It was just sort of like starting up.
00:19:05 We didn't have stats or anything.
00:19:06 Yeah, the campaigns die in their infancy.
00:19:08 No stats, damn.
00:19:10 What is it without stats?
00:19:12 Nothing.
00:19:13 I mean, like when you and I did another one.
00:19:14 You just jerk each other off.
00:19:14 It was a Homestuck one.
00:19:17 What was that Homestuck one we did called,
00:19:19 or was it Luke?
00:19:20 Oh, Sperb, Sperb.
00:19:22 Sperb, the Homestuck RP.
00:19:24 Have I talked, I'm sure I've talked about that.
00:19:26 Yeah, you talked about it.
00:19:27 That was like no stats.
00:19:29 It was better.
00:19:30 Did a lot of it through texting.
00:19:33 The thing with the DMing,
00:19:35 like you were saying, Nate,
00:19:36 like you had you perfectly crafted a story.
00:19:38 It seems like a fool's errand to try and do that.
00:19:41 Cause basically what you're doing.
00:19:42 See, what I was doing was video game design
00:19:44 when I should have been doing like talking
00:19:46 with friends design.
00:19:47 Like you're writing like a story,
00:19:49 but like you're writing a story like in a public place
00:19:52 and people can just come up to your laptop
00:19:54 and type something in and you have to keep it in.
00:19:56 So you're like, oh God, fine.
00:19:58 Like you're trying to write a novel,
00:20:00 like fucking Game of Thrones man.
00:20:04 Type in his thing and then some jackoff says,
00:20:07 huh, and then they take a shit.
00:20:09 And he's like, that's stupid.
00:20:11 No, that's not correct.
00:20:13 Your character isn't that doing that now.
00:20:16 Yeah.
00:20:17 It was a, you know, I mean, it was my first time DMing.
00:20:20 I way over prepared kind of, and I learned it,
00:20:23 but it also kind of soured me.
00:20:24 And I'm like, well, fuck this shit man.
00:20:26 It seems like so much work.
00:20:28 You need to be a real like lover
00:20:31 of seeing people interact in that sort of setting
00:20:35 to get into DMing.
00:20:37 Being a DM is like, it's like a,
00:20:39 it's your new hobby if you do it.
00:20:41 You can't, you can't just like,
00:20:43 I mean, I guess if you want it,
00:20:46 maybe you could just like show up and just improv it.
00:20:49 Or like, I guess you could buy a pre-prepared campaign,
00:20:51 to the time that wouldn't work out so well.
00:20:53 The pre-prepared campaigns are stupid though.
00:20:55 You gotta, you do have to do a lot of improving,
00:20:58 no matter what.
00:20:59 Even if you're good, and even if you prepare shit,
00:21:01 you do have to be able to like adjust your plans
00:21:03 on the fly.
00:21:04 I think we, like we as the PCP could do
00:21:07 like an improv D&D thing.
00:21:09 Somebody just makes shit up.
00:21:11 Yeah, we were supposed to,
00:21:13 we were supposed to frickin' do it.
00:21:16 We were gonna do that one by Don Jolly, right?
00:21:19 Yeah, we were gonna.
00:21:19 He said that Don Jolly made a game,
00:21:21 and we were gonna, it was like,
00:21:22 it's called the Gorefest, I think.
00:21:24 Gorefest, yeah.
00:21:25 Yeah, we were gonna play it at Radcon,
00:21:26 and we never got around to it.
00:21:28 That's true, that's true.
00:21:29 We could still do it.
00:21:31 We could still do it any time.
00:21:32 We could just do it in a Skype call,
00:21:33 or a Skype call, wall, discord.
00:21:35 Yeah, imagine.
00:21:36 The fuck is a Skype?
00:21:38 I don't know.
00:21:39 Never think about Skype.
00:21:41 Try not to.
00:21:42 I've gotta use Zoom,
00:21:43 that all the kids are talking about these days,
00:21:45 for a Mother's Day.
00:21:47 I think, Mother's Day Zoom call.
00:21:49 The change from Skype to Discord
00:21:52 is the point where reality shifted
00:21:54 into a parallel, worse dimension,
00:21:56 and the point where Discord is now shifting into Zoom
00:22:00 is gonna be an even worse dimension than that.
00:22:02 We have to stop changing these things.
00:22:04 We have to stop bringing new timelines.
00:22:05 We all need to go back to AOL Instant Messenger.
00:22:07 Yes, that was, because that was when
00:22:09 life was last good.
00:22:13 Oh, good new bed, after all.
00:22:15 I don't know, right?
00:22:16 My biggest memories of AOL Instant Messenger
00:22:19 are being a kid with crushes in high school
00:22:23 and middle school, acting on none of them,
00:22:25 and feeling bad a lot about my inability
00:22:28 to talk to women.
00:22:29 I didn't have that in AOL.
00:22:31 I had that in MSN.
00:22:32 Yeah.
00:22:33 Was that one removed?
00:22:34 That was around the same time.
00:22:35 Yeah, similar kind of things.
00:22:37 I had the email address of a girl I liked,
00:22:40 but she wrote it, and I typed it in wrong.
00:22:44 No, I think she wrote it, and I couldn't read
00:22:47 one of the dashes or an underscore,
00:22:48 and I got it wrong.
00:22:50 And so I emailed her, but I didn't realize
00:22:52 that it was the wrong one.
00:22:55 Did you just assume she hated you or something?
00:22:58 Huh?
00:22:58 Did you assume she was just blowing you off and stuff?
00:23:03 I can certainly see that happening.
00:23:04 I can't remember what happened.
00:23:06 It wasn't that big of a deal, but it was just very,
00:23:09 oh no, she doesn't give a shit.
00:23:13 I wish you never noticed.
00:23:15 I wish those things never existed,
00:23:17 and that we lived in the Stone Ages or whatever,
00:23:19 because then I never would have had
00:23:20 those late night, extremely embarrassing
00:23:22 like hours and hours long conversations with girls.
00:23:25 I just wanted to say, I am sexually attracted to you.
00:23:28 Please understand that fact.
00:23:30 Ignore all the stupid shit I'm saying.
00:23:32 That is the point of this conversation.
00:23:34 Instead of, you know, just going on and on
00:23:36 about whatever the fuck happened at school that day.
00:23:39 Oh, it's, I did that.
00:23:41 Truly a waste of time.
00:23:42 I mean, I skipped the small talk
00:23:45 and I made an embarrassing comment
00:23:47 that was too sexually charged,
00:23:49 and I think-
00:23:51 What's wrong with that?
00:23:52 You know what, it's not embarrassing.
00:23:54 It's better to err on the side of that than-
00:23:56 I agree, I agree.
00:23:58 You don't want to err on the side of that.
00:23:58 You waste less time that way for sure.
00:24:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:24:02 But I feel like I became not like a big rumor,
00:24:05 but like a little bit like a guy.
00:24:09 He cares about sex.
00:24:13 What a degenerate, no one does that.
00:24:17 My biggest fear was that anyone would find out
00:24:18 that I was sexually attracted to anyone.
00:24:21 That was my nightmare scenario.
00:24:23 No one can, to this day, I don't want anyone to know
00:24:26 that I feel those things.
00:24:27 It would be career ending to say that-
00:24:29 It is, it is, yeah.
00:24:30 That was pretty shitty.
00:24:31 Yeah, indeed.
00:24:35 Good times, good times.
00:24:37 Yeah, pretty good.
00:24:38 No one should have that power over you ever.
00:24:40 That's what it truly means to be a man.
00:24:43 That's true.
00:24:44 That's why Migtau is the greatest man on the planet,
00:24:46 and I aspire to be just like them.
00:24:49 I really was not a fully developed human being
00:24:52 until I went to Japan and became the samurai warrior,
00:24:56 and it felt real good.
00:24:59 Yeah, you became a real man in Japan,
00:25:01 but as soon as you came back,
00:25:02 you reverted- I lost it all, yeah.
00:25:03 You've never been a saint since.
00:25:05 Yeah, that's true, unfortunately.
00:25:06 That's where my heart, what is it, my heart?
00:25:09 What's that fucking line from it in that poem
00:25:13 that the fat kid wrote to the hot girl?
00:25:15 Oh, yeah, mine burns there, too.
00:25:17 My heart burns there, too, or whatever the fuck it is.
00:25:19 Yes, that's me for the land of Nippon,
00:25:21 my Japanese brethren.
00:25:25 You know, me and Michelle have talked about
00:25:28 winding up a trip one of these years,
00:25:30 maybe next year, I don't know, maybe the year afterward,
00:25:32 specifically to go see the Sakura Blooms.
00:25:34 Oh, and Victor was telling us about his trip
00:25:37 and giving us some tips about where to go
00:25:38 for reasonably cheap flights,
00:25:40 and it's not even, I don't know,
00:25:42 if you have $3,000 that you're willing
00:25:45 to invest in that kind of a trip,
00:25:47 which you could save up, not too hard for,
00:25:50 yeah, you could make that shit happen.
00:25:52 It doesn't have to be just a dream, ladies and gentlemen.
00:25:56 One of these days, go see the Sakura Blooms.
00:25:58 I have a dream of walking the earth
00:26:00 and being around no one and disappearing,
00:26:03 and the dream kinda, it's hard to rationalize that
00:26:07 with also having someone who wants to go places with you
00:26:10 because it's like, oh man, someday I'm gonna go over here
00:26:13 and to this country, and I'm gonna go over there
00:26:15 and I'm gonna travel the world and go to all these places,
00:26:17 and then you meet someone and they're like,
00:26:20 oh yeah, we can do all that together,
00:26:22 and it's like, no, you don't understand.
00:26:23 The whole point of me traveling is to have no one
00:26:26 be around me ever again.
00:26:29 Me traveling is not a fun thing to do
00:26:32 with somebody who I love.
00:26:34 It's a break glass in case of emergency.
00:26:38 All the other options have been used up.
00:26:40 It's time for this now.
00:26:43 I getcha, I getcha.
00:26:44 I guess with me, I mean, my real everyday drive,
00:26:48 all I wanna do is play the video games
00:26:51 I wanna play sometimes and work.
00:26:54 These are like my, and I gotta know, exercise sometimes
00:26:56 and eat the food I like.
00:26:57 It's like, yeah, cause like if I have someone
00:26:58 I like hanging out with here,
00:27:00 what the hell's the point of going anywhere else?
00:27:03 Yeah, I mean, I physically feel a desire to travel.
00:27:06 Also, god damn it, I just wish I lived near the ocean,
00:27:10 which I will before too long, I think.
00:27:12 That would make my life just feel better.
00:27:13 You know what, you're right.
00:27:14 I think this might be one of those fake opinions
00:27:16 that I sometimes have about them,
00:27:19 and I realize it was all, it's not even true.
00:27:23 It's a nice idea, just the idea of being like
00:27:27 an explorer, but like, you know, like a rugged,
00:27:30 like I don't give a fuck.
00:27:31 I'm just gonna walk around the world.
00:27:33 I saw a video once of like a guy who took a picture
00:27:36 every day while he was traveling the world
00:27:39 and his beard grew to like two meters long or whatever.
00:27:42 And I was like, that's a cool thing,
00:27:43 but then I realized how annoying it would be
00:27:45 and how expensive and time intensive
00:27:48 and like planning would, you know,
00:27:51 you can't just do that without dying instantly.
00:27:54 There's gotta be cheaper ways.
00:27:55 Like if you're, obviously if you're traveling the world,
00:27:57 I assume you're not, well, I mean,
00:28:00 you're not gonna fucking like, I don't know,
00:28:01 drive through like all of Europe and all of Asia.
00:28:04 No, this particular guy like walked across
00:28:07 like the entire, like from, I don't know, China
00:28:10 to fucking Italy or whatever.
00:28:12 Britain or something?
00:28:13 Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
00:28:14 I think there's like, I think there's like a clear line
00:28:17 between like couples traveling
00:28:19 and like finding yourself traveling.
00:28:22 Like when it comes to like couples traveling,
00:28:25 I have like, I have like these little dreams,
00:28:28 but they're not like goals.
00:28:30 They're more like images where I see myself like,
00:28:32 hey, it'd be cool to take that special woman
00:28:34 and just be like on the street in Paris,
00:28:36 just like sitting while that Paris music plays
00:28:39 like in that episode of X-Men
00:28:40 where Wolverine finds God and Rogan Gambit are like sitting.
00:28:43 Yeah.
00:28:45 Like I always picture myself as Gambit in that exact scenario
00:28:49 and like, yeah, that'd be fucking cool.
00:28:53 You know, lecturing my woman about atheism, like,
00:28:58 I say it's all random, Cher.
00:29:00 Live hand you a full house or a busted flush.
00:29:05 That'd be fucking cool.
00:29:06 But then when I picture like solo traveling,
00:29:08 I picture like, like everyone thinking,
00:29:11 like faking my death and living in a temple
00:29:13 and like fucking Thailand or something for a year,
00:29:17 like up in the mountains.
00:29:18 Like doing chores, like carrying like the stick
00:29:20 with the two buckets of water on it, up the steps,
00:29:23 you know, learning to like find some kind of spiritual remedy
00:29:28 for this affliction that tears us all apart daily
00:29:32 in this cruel world that we live in, this cruel society.
00:29:37 You know, I had a buddy, I had a buddy in,
00:29:40 I don't know, high school growing up
00:29:42 who went after I left high school and stuff
00:29:44 and joined a monk, I don't know, what do you call it?
00:29:48 Like he gave us all his possessions
00:29:50 and did that shit.
00:29:51 Buddhist monk thing?
00:29:52 No, it was like a Jesuit monk, like that kind of thing.
00:29:55 It was like Christian oriented, I think.
00:29:58 He just did that for a while.
00:29:59 And the funny thing was, like afterward,
00:30:02 you know, I can't speak to what's going on in the guy's head.
00:30:04 I don't really know him particularly well,
00:30:06 but afterward, after like years of doing that,
00:30:09 he just kind of seemed like the same guy.
00:30:10 I was just kind of like, what was gained?
00:30:12 What was gained by all that?
00:30:14 Maybe he just enjoyed it.
00:30:15 It was enlightening in some way.
00:30:17 I'm not privy to.
00:30:18 Frankly, we've never really talked about it that much.
00:30:20 Well, that's the cruel irony about personal growth.
00:30:23 It's not like on TV where the character arc happens
00:30:26 and everyone can see it and appreciate it.
00:30:28 You know, in real life, you learn and you grow as a person,
00:30:31 but like it's still like in your head
00:30:33 and everyone still treats you like the same old asshole.
00:30:36 If he hasn't changed his hairstyle visibly,
00:30:37 it doesn't count as character development.
00:30:39 Like in time-skaps and anime.
00:30:40 If you don't make a fucking YouTube vlog series
00:30:42 that people can watch as a TV show, then you haven't changed.
00:30:46 If you're not constantly narcissistically talking
00:30:48 about yourself in public for all to see and comment on,
00:30:52 then nothing you do counts and no change has actually occurred.
00:30:56 What you can actually do is like take your life experience,
00:31:00 put it into a character and write a story
00:31:02 and then people like the character and then they like you.
00:31:05 Yeah, then you go surprise motherfuckers.
00:31:07 It was me that you liked all along.
00:31:09 Did you guys ever read Siddhartha by Herman Hess?
00:31:12 I think I read that.
00:31:13 I don't know what a book is.
00:31:15 Our dad told me that that book was about Buddha.
00:31:19 It's not.
00:31:19 It's not literally Buddha, no.
00:31:21 But he doesn't mean Buddha in there.
00:31:23 So Buddha is a character briefly, I think,
00:31:25 if I remember correctly.
00:31:26 He's mentioned, I guess so.
00:31:27 Maybe I should get in the back of the doubt.
00:31:29 It's just about a guy finding enlightenment basically,
00:31:31 which ultimately ends with him like he's just like a man
00:31:34 who like works a river crossing,
00:31:36 but he goes through like all this, I don't know,
00:31:38 like he follows a path of spiritual enlightenment
00:31:41 much like the Buddha did.
00:31:42 He goes gay.
00:31:43 That's how he finds enlightenment.
00:31:45 He gets his river crossing boyfriend.
00:31:47 No, Ben, no, that's not the canon.
00:31:51 That's your fanfic, Ben.
00:31:53 They're just best buddies.
00:31:55 They're definitely gay.
00:31:56 Okay, they may be gay,
00:31:57 but the thing they're gayest for
00:31:58 is crossing that fucking river and they love that shit.
00:32:01 Sure.
00:32:02 They do that shit over on the same page there.
00:32:04 And I don't know, that book was pretty cool.
00:32:08 I think that was one of the books famously I did
00:32:10 before growing a brain,
00:32:12 but even then I think I still got the gist.
00:32:15 There's probably a lot of like fucking farmers out there
00:32:18 who just like are, I think enlightenment just means-
00:32:21 Who also just whisper ohm into their gay lover's ear.
00:32:24 Right, right.
00:32:25 And fucking giggle about him.
00:32:26 As they peg him from behind.
00:32:27 God.
00:32:30 It makes me wonder, the way that like he ends up
00:32:32 after reading that book, it made me feel like,
00:32:35 are there just like people out there
00:32:37 who just don't spend every waking moment
00:32:39 like concerned with like their destiny and like the future
00:32:43 and are just like enjoying being alive
00:32:45 that like technically count as enlightened.
00:32:48 I think, cause that's kind of what it is, right?
00:32:50 That's what that's what Buddha's about.
00:32:52 It depends on your perspective on what enlightened is,
00:32:54 I suppose, I think for a lot of people
00:32:56 that would be like enlightenment,
00:32:57 understanding that the impermanence of life
00:33:00 and how all you're striving for
00:33:02 doesn't really matter at the end of the day.
00:33:03 I finally beat my high score in Ninja Suffering.
00:33:05 Holy fuck.
00:33:05 Congratulations, Tom.
00:33:07 Well, that's what you're high score.
00:33:08 Wait, wait, wait, go back, go back to the thing
00:33:10 about how everything's meaningless work.
00:33:14 That's what I wanna talk about.
00:33:15 It's like, hey guys, when we die, we'll forget everything.
00:33:18 Well, that's kind of a hideously depressing irony
00:33:22 where like the person actively seeking enlightenment
00:33:25 by seeking it is less enlightened
00:33:27 than the stupid dumb shit who just doesn't care
00:33:30 and is fucking sitting around all happy and shit
00:33:32 like a fucking bastard.
00:33:33 As the timeless phrase goes, ignorance is bliss.
00:33:36 Okay, but surely like, I mean, in Siddhartha,
00:33:39 the guy like goes on a quest and then he like,
00:33:42 you couldn't call that guy ignorant or whatever
00:33:44 because he's seen it all.
00:33:46 But maybe it's fair to say that like,
00:33:47 because he's like deactivated the nodes of his brain,
00:33:50 that's like, well, what was the point of worrying
00:33:52 about all that?
00:33:52 I will just help people cross this river
00:33:54 and that'll be my life
00:33:56 and I'll enjoy the simple pleasures inherent in it.
00:33:59 Is that like, you know, willful ignorance perhaps?
00:34:02 Or is that just a realization that through all my struggles
00:34:06 of trying to understand what's going on in the world,
00:34:09 I find that like the answers were all, you know,
00:34:11 just to be present and enjoy life
00:34:14 and there is no greater truth I could discover,
00:34:17 I don't know, like that I have the tools to find.
00:34:20 We don't have Star Trek tri-quarters,
00:34:22 so I can't figure out more than, I don't know,
00:34:24 even that, that's all like physical stuff.
00:34:24 I mean, tri-quarters?
00:34:26 That's what they call their little scan things.
00:34:27 They used to deduce everything in Star Trek.
00:34:30 I don't know what it means.
00:34:31 It means something, but I don't fucking know.
00:34:33 Gabe, what were you saying something?
00:34:36 Well, I was saying like personally,
00:34:40 the idea of there being like a, you know,
00:34:42 an enlightened state where you understand the universe.
00:34:45 Like I hear about these things,
00:34:46 people talking, waxing philosophical
00:34:49 about having, you know, understood things finally.
00:34:52 And I'm like sitting here and I'm like,
00:34:54 you know, I don't know whether I have or haven't.
00:34:56 I don't think I'll ever understand the moment,
00:34:58 when or whether or if I ever like understand anything.
00:35:04 Like how best to enjoy life,
00:35:06 whether I'm wasting my time,
00:35:08 not striving for something where I could be,
00:35:11 or whether it's not like important to do that.
00:35:16 A lot of the time I just think,
00:35:17 oh, if I don't fucking care, I'll just jack off
00:35:19 and it'll be fine.
00:35:20 We all agree that like, okay,
00:35:24 we don't know about any afterlife or any of that bullshit.
00:35:27 Maybe it exists, I don't know, probably not.
00:35:29 No reason to think so.
00:35:31 So like all we've got is like the time that we're here alive
00:35:34 and like what quantifies as a good usage of that time?
00:35:38 Is it like-
00:35:39 Jacking off.
00:35:40 I don't know.
00:35:41 You're right.
00:35:42 It's the only thing that qualifies.
00:35:44 I'm curious, what's more enlightened theoretically
00:35:47 about like being a river crossing guy
00:35:49 who helps people cross versus like literally
00:35:52 just the extreme example of being hooked up matrix style
00:35:55 to like a pleasure machine and just, you know,
00:35:58 getting that fed to your brain at all times
00:36:00 to keep you like perfectly satisfied.
00:36:01 What is more enlightened about that
00:36:03 rather than just recognizing, you know?
00:36:05 I've thought about this because there was, you know,
00:36:08 it's a common like idea.
00:36:11 I've seen it before.
00:36:13 The idea of a machine that just gives you pleasure
00:36:16 is disgusting to me as a person who knows
00:36:21 that I'm not currently in one and I could go into one.
00:36:24 If I was born in that and I had no other knowledge,
00:36:27 then obviously I'd enjoy it.
00:36:29 Because there's like a very, like there's a fakeness to it
00:36:35 that I can perceive as a person
00:36:36 who is not currently hooked up to a machine,
00:36:38 although I might be, you know, in some like real matrix,
00:36:41 like, oh, there's a fucking another level to it.
00:36:44 But like, if there was a choice, you know,
00:36:47 do you want to get hooked up to a pleasure machine
00:36:49 or do you want to suffer in the life
00:36:50 that you currently live in and sometimes feel good?
00:36:52 I'll be like, nah, I'm good.
00:36:54 I'll just, you know, poke at rocks on the ground.
00:36:57 I mean, that's pretty fun.
00:36:59 I don't need pleasure all the time.
00:37:01 I would just leave me alone.
00:37:03 I mean, okay.
00:37:04 I mean, I don't know, like, is it all just hedonism?
00:37:07 Like, because we know that like a perfect pleasure machine
00:37:10 certainly isn't a realistic thing.
00:37:12 It's like, oh, don't be tempted by, you know,
00:37:14 like drugs or stuff like that
00:37:15 because it probably won't work out very well.
00:37:17 Like, what's the metric?
00:37:19 Is it specifically like happiness in life?
00:37:22 Is it?
00:37:23 There is no metric.
00:37:24 I mean, it depends on the individual.
00:37:26 Oh, this fucking sucks.
00:37:28 This is a stupid question.
00:37:29 If there's a hypothetical, like, it's just good
00:37:31 and there's no bad quote, this just is pleasurable.
00:37:35 I would still be a bit like iffy
00:37:36 because I know that it's a machine
00:37:38 and I feel like real things are real.
00:37:41 Even if once I'm hooked up, I would be perfectly happy
00:37:45 hypothetically, then I just still would be like,
00:37:48 nah, nah, you have fun, kids.
00:37:50 I'm just gonna die.
00:37:51 I'd rather die.
00:37:52 I've been living my whole life with the idea
00:37:54 that eventually I'm gonna pass away
00:37:56 and that this is what life is.
00:37:57 I don't wanna fucking, I just don't wanna think about it.
00:38:01 Just leave me alone.
00:38:02 I hope I don't die.
00:38:02 But that's what the machine is for.
00:38:05 The machine will make you not think about it.
00:38:07 Nah, nah, these people come into me with clipboards
00:38:09 and goggles and they say,
00:38:10 wait, this is the new fucking science thing.
00:38:12 And I'm like, shut up, I'm jacking off here.
00:38:15 I mean, I think the mechanism, fair.
00:38:19 I feel the mechanism we have in our brain
00:38:21 that makes us feel like, oh, that's like fake and gross
00:38:24 is a thing that's been built into us
00:38:26 that's like a human skepticism of things
00:38:29 that are too good to be true, must be,
00:38:31 and truly it'll actually be bad for me in the long run.
00:38:34 But I mean, what if they work out the bugs?
00:38:35 I like being a stupid monkey,
00:38:37 scrabbling around on the ground with rocks
00:38:40 and not knowing how to do things.
00:38:43 It's funny, it's just funny.
00:38:44 I like being that.
00:38:46 It's funny.
00:38:47 I kinda feel the opposite.
00:38:48 I'm always hoping to find that new plateau of wisdom
00:38:54 and like better myself as a person.
00:38:56 Nate, I think you agree with that.
00:39:00 The rest of you too,
00:39:00 I don't know why I singled out Nate.
00:39:02 Only Nate, only Nate.
00:39:05 You know, and I feel like, yes, every year,
00:39:07 I do feel like infinitely smarter and wiser
00:39:11 and like I've grown as a person
00:39:13 and I'm better than I was in the previous year.
00:39:16 But I have yet to cross the threshold
00:39:19 where all of that increased exponential wisdom
00:39:21 yields happiness or any kind of contentment or...
00:39:26 I'm concerned.
00:39:27 It seems to just make me more miserable every year.
00:39:29 The more better a person I feel.
00:39:30 I'm concerned that now,
00:39:32 now that I'm deeply depressed all the time,
00:39:34 I have crossed that threshold
00:39:36 and now I do have the clearest idea that I've ever had
00:39:40 and it's just that the truth is bad.
00:39:42 Oh God, listen, I would have been better off not knowing.
00:39:44 Oh, don't talk about how the truth is bad.
00:39:46 I don't wanna think about it.
00:39:48 My perspective is that pleasure is bullshit and wrong
00:39:53 and it should be a spice in life and not your end goal.
00:39:56 People should be searching for purpose, not pleasure.
00:39:58 Those are different things.
00:39:59 Purpose is doing something that is long-term,
00:40:04 continues to be something that you build towards
00:40:06 and you understand that purpose means
00:40:08 you are going to have bad times.
00:40:10 Things are going to be hard and it's going to suck.
00:40:13 I think I did hear once from somewhere,
00:40:16 I read it somewhere, somehow it got in my brain
00:40:19 that the idea of happiness as a state of being
00:40:24 as opposed to just a fleeting emotion
00:40:26 is a relatively new concept in human history
00:40:29 that was invented in the last 100 years or so
00:40:33 and that invention of this idea of just being happy
00:40:39 has irreparably destroyed humanity.
00:40:42 Yeah, I don't think it's good.
00:40:44 I think it's damaging.
00:40:45 It's like a state that cannot naturally be achieved.
00:40:48 It's only been in the last 100 years
00:40:49 that that was even something that could be conceptualized.
00:40:54 Back in the day, you were a surf, work in the fields
00:40:57 and it's just like, what do you mean happy all the time?
00:41:00 I'm happy when I don't have the plague.
00:41:05 Right, it's like life was kind of like miserable.
00:41:09 Happiness is just the absence of all the bad things
00:41:12 you're usually thinking about
00:41:13 for like five fucking minutes or something.
00:41:16 Yeah, definitely true for me.
00:41:18 I don't even live in the present.
00:41:20 I'm mostly like 90% of my time,
00:41:24 I'm either like dwelling on horrible things
00:41:26 that have happened in the past or things I regret or rue
00:41:30 or I'm imagining a wonderful future
00:41:33 where I've achieved enough or accomplished enough
00:41:36 that I feel good enough to no longer
00:41:38 have to constantly dwell on the horrible past
00:41:41 and I'm always kind of like back and forth between those two
00:41:44 and like the only time I'm ever in the present
00:41:47 is when I'm jacked off.
00:41:49 That's the only time I wanna be in the present.
00:41:53 I don't know, I think it's a fairly agreed upon fact
00:41:57 that I seem like a fairly upbeat person overall,
00:42:00 perhaps of the more upbeat among this group
00:42:03 and it makes me think that like I think the reason for that
00:42:06 and maybe it's literally that I'm,
00:42:08 I guess the uncharitable it would be stupid
00:42:12 that I just don't spend a lot of time
00:42:14 concerned about the bad things
00:42:16 and I'm just focused on the stuff I'm trying to do to,
00:42:21 like right now my focus in life in general
00:42:23 is to make enough money so I'm not losing money every month
00:42:27 and we'll be able to grow and then buy the things I want
00:42:31 which I know are like the things
00:42:32 that lead generally to happiness.
00:42:34 I don't know, owning a house would be nice.
00:42:35 Like having enough money to have property,
00:42:37 having money, you know.
00:42:39 I definitely feel infinitely better in general
00:42:42 when I am engaging with a plan of action
00:42:46 or actively doing something or working
00:42:48 or accomplishing something,
00:42:51 which is why I was really happy
00:42:54 for a few brief months there
00:42:56 when I started going to the gym
00:42:58 before the US government decided
00:43:00 that I should be fat again
00:43:01 and close down all the gyms everywhere forever.
00:43:05 For a year.
00:43:05 And I'll have an excuse
00:43:06 because my gym is in my basement.
00:43:07 I could be working out this whole time, but I'm not.
00:43:11 Oh boy.
00:43:12 Jesse, it could be worse.
00:43:13 You could have a spine injury
00:43:14 that prevents you from doing any exercise whatsoever anymore.
00:43:17 They're still on about that, Tom.
00:43:19 Let's get over it.
00:43:20 Oh, listen to this, we've heard about that.
00:43:22 I'll get over it, pussy, wonk it off.
00:43:25 I wish, man, I tried using the Bowflex
00:43:28 in the house yesterday and it fucked me up pretty bad
00:43:31 and I was like, well, I guess I'm not doing that
00:43:32 at any time soon.
00:43:33 I cannot exercise outside of a gym.
00:43:37 My brain cannot do it.
00:43:40 It's exponentially worse not exercising at a gym.
00:43:43 Plus I hate body weight exercises.
00:43:45 They're fucking pussy shit.
00:43:46 I want to do fucking bench.
00:43:47 I don't like going to the gym.
00:43:49 I like my basement.
00:43:51 But that's the whole point.
00:43:52 The other thing is-
00:43:52 I don't like going to the gym
00:43:53 so I want to get in and get out as quickly as possible.
00:43:56 That's not about motivation.
00:43:57 When I'm at my house, I still don't like working out
00:43:59 but my computer's right there.
00:44:01 Well, the main thing is I've never been able
00:44:03 to really live alone for any extended period of time.
00:44:06 I'm always have other people in the house with me.
00:44:08 Like I'm quarantined with other people in the house.
00:44:10 I don't want people in the house hearing me
00:44:12 or seeing me work out.
00:44:13 It's fucking embarrassing.
00:44:14 It's not embarrassing at the gym
00:44:16 because everyone's doing it.
00:44:17 But the idea that someone else around me
00:44:19 knows that I am actively concerned about my health
00:44:22 fills me with humiliation and rage.
00:44:24 Are you simping for your own body?
00:44:25 That's fucking gross, dude.
00:44:27 What is this shit?
00:44:29 It's imagined up.
00:44:30 It's almost like a tesset admission that I'm fat.
00:44:33 Yeah.
00:44:34 Like, no, I'm not.
00:44:36 I just wanna be a little bit healthy.
00:44:37 I will not admit to being fat outside the gym.
00:44:40 Even worse, it's that you care that you're fat.
00:44:42 Just being fat can be cool.
00:44:44 But if you care, ooh, cringe, big cringe.
00:44:47 Since the gym closed, I have become a fucking planet.
00:44:52 I am so grotesque.
00:44:53 I look at myself and I feel like I lay in bed
00:44:56 and I sit in a chair and I feel my fucking fat folds
00:44:59 flopping over the edges of it.
00:45:01 And I'm just filled with so much hate for all things.
00:45:04 Hate for the government who created this conspiracy.
00:45:07 You know, everyone has their own ideas
00:45:08 and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus.
00:45:10 You know, there's no truth anymore.
00:45:11 No one really knows what's going on.
00:45:13 My chosen personal conspiracy theory
00:45:16 is that this whole thing was manufactured
00:45:19 to get me fat again because they knew that me being
00:45:21 in shape and me being happy with myself
00:45:23 would be too powerful and I'd overthrow
00:45:25 this whole stinking corrupt system.
00:45:27 So they had to do something to close down the gym
00:45:29 and keep me from it and this is what they thought of.
00:45:31 This is their excuse and it's working so far
00:45:34 and I just, I'm so sad.
00:45:37 I'm so angry, I was so committed.
00:45:41 Like when I finally started doing it, you know,
00:45:43 it took me, it took me my whole life.
00:45:46 When I finally started doing it, I'm like, oh my God,
00:45:48 Islam is the way in the light.
00:45:50 I finally see, I am enlightened.
00:45:52 I will never stop coming here.
00:45:54 I will come here every single day
00:45:55 and fucking clang and bang and kick ass and I did.
00:45:58 And I did great and I lost like 30 pounds or something.
00:46:01 Like I was 240 when I started.
00:46:05 And by the end of it, I was 210 in a span of like,
00:46:10 I think three or four months and I'm like, oh my God,
00:46:13 I look great, I feel great.
00:46:14 This is so cool, I'll never stop doing this ever.
00:46:17 And then like 2020 started and for the first few months
00:46:20 of 2020, I was staying with family like in another state
00:46:23 and I couldn't get into planet fitness
00:46:25 because they're like, oh, you need your driver's license
00:46:27 to get in here and I'm like, I don't have it.
00:46:28 I took a train here so I couldn't get in the gym there.
00:46:31 And so then after that, I went to Virginia with you guys
00:46:35 and then we fucking binge ate and fucking drank
00:46:37 and that was even worse.
00:46:38 And so then as soon as I got back from that,
00:46:41 it was like, oh, now everyone's quarantined.
00:46:43 You can't even go outside.
00:46:45 You're not even allowed to move.
00:46:47 You're legally required to stay in bed
00:46:50 and be a sack of shit.
00:46:53 And so I'm already like, I went from 240 to 210
00:46:58 and now I'm back at 233.
00:47:01 And like, even though I'm not as fat as when I started,
00:47:06 like it feels more fat because I now have been
00:47:08 to the mountain top and now to even be back down here,
00:47:11 feels even more grotesque than it used to.
00:47:14 And I'm going fucking stir crazy with it.
00:47:16 I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna snap people.
00:47:18 The worst thing about the quarantine,
00:47:20 just for me personally, how my life has been affected
00:47:22 is that I can, that's like the main way
00:47:25 that my actual day-to-day life has been affected
00:47:26 that I cannot go to the gym when I want to,
00:47:29 which, I mean, yeah, I've got my fucking pull-up bar.
00:47:32 I'll do push-ups.
00:47:33 I fucking hate it.
00:47:34 Pull-ups, I guess, are okay.
00:47:35 But I fucking hate all this body weight exercise is stupid.
00:47:39 I don't even believe in that body weight.
00:47:40 I think they literally are fake.
00:47:41 It's just, yeah.
00:47:42 Just like, like standing on a treadmill
00:47:45 and being able to like run in place
00:47:48 or like walk up an incline in place
00:47:50 and like listen to music while you're doing it
00:47:52 or just like finding like sitting at the weight machines
00:47:56 and doing the, you know, the rote activities
00:47:59 that are like, you know, that are illustrated on the side
00:48:02 that you can't possibly mess up.
00:48:04 You know, just like turning your brain off
00:48:05 and doing those things.
00:48:07 That is the only correct way to work out.
00:48:09 Any of these fucking like,
00:48:11 any of these like workout without weight machines,
00:48:14 fucking shit that people did in the caveman days,
00:48:16 it's fucking barbaric and I refuse to do it.
00:48:19 Oh, oh, do burpees.
00:48:21 I don't want to do a burpee.
00:48:22 No, I don't ever want to fucking touch it.
00:48:25 I don't, a burpee is like what you do to a fucking baby.
00:48:28 It doesn't sound like something that a grown man,
00:48:30 a civilized person would ever do
00:48:32 and I refuse to take part in it.
00:48:34 I hate the word burpee.
00:48:35 I just find it very, I mean, I don't want to do it.
00:48:37 It is when you do like a squat jumping jack thing.
00:48:40 It's like you, it's like you late, you get in a pushup
00:48:43 and then you stand up and then you jump
00:48:44 and then you get back in the pushup.
00:48:46 Yeah. Yeah, okay.
00:48:48 It's dishonorable and it's shameful.
00:48:51 You'll never catch me doing one.
00:48:53 Why on earth is it called a burpee?
00:48:54 I thought it was like a baby thing.
00:48:56 I don't know.
00:48:57 I don't know where it came from.
00:48:58 Everything that's been named in the last 10 years
00:49:01 has been terrible.
00:49:02 For some reason we lost the ability
00:49:03 to name things in a cool way.
00:49:04 The name is the barrier for entry.
00:49:06 I can't do anything called a burpee.
00:49:08 I won't, ever.
00:49:10 And you know, on the other point.
00:49:11 What about a slurpee?
00:49:12 A slurpee I will do.
00:49:13 I prefer a slurpee.
00:49:13 And that's part of the problem.
00:49:15 I'd fucking, I like going to the gym
00:49:17 because I like just having the ambiance.
00:49:19 Nobody ever, I've never made contact
00:49:21 with a single fucking person in the gym ever
00:49:23 under any circumstances, no matter what basically.
00:49:26 But I like having them there
00:49:29 for the tacit, ominous feeling of oppression
00:49:32 that if I do something embarrassing,
00:49:34 if I even just sit there and don't do anything there,
00:49:37 if from the side of their eye,
00:49:38 from the corner of their perception,
00:49:40 it will be noticed that I'm being that guy at the gym.
00:49:43 And that little bit of motivation.
00:49:45 Not to mention just the fact that I have to get my gear
00:49:47 and go to the gym.
00:49:49 It commits you to getting a workout done and getting done.
00:49:52 Whereas I spent two hours working the other day
00:49:54 because I was just watching some fucking
00:49:56 Star Trek Voyager while I was exercising.
00:49:58 Don't do, because it's in my fucking work room.
00:50:00 It's in my room with my computer.
00:50:02 What am I gonna not watch TV while I exercise?
00:50:04 Well, that would be retarded.
00:50:05 Of course I'm going to.
00:50:07 And the workout took twice as long
00:50:08 and I wasted tons of fucking time.
00:50:10 It's a nightmare.
00:50:11 It's horrible.
00:50:12 I don't like it.
00:50:13 Gyms are bad.
00:50:14 I'm happy to pay money.
00:50:15 I want the financial burden on my back
00:50:18 forcing me to go workout more.
00:50:19 And you're right about that.
00:50:20 The constant looming threat of doing something wrong
00:50:23 at the gym is what gets your ass and gear the most.
00:50:27 Absolutely.
00:50:28 I have the fucking, okay.
00:50:30 I don't know if I've told this story before.
00:50:33 This was like the dumbest thing that I ever did at the gym.
00:50:35 And it's still, I still think about it.
00:50:38 And I feel horrified at the thing that I did.
00:50:42 I was like, so I was at the gym
00:50:44 and I was on like one of the machines
00:50:46 just like lifting the weights and fucking doing the thing.
00:50:49 And you know, when you're done with it,
00:50:50 you get up and you go and you get your little paper towel
00:50:53 and you get your little spray
00:50:54 and you just come back and spray it down.
00:50:57 So I finish and I get up
00:50:59 and I go to get the paper towel and the spray
00:51:01 and I come back to wipe down my seat
00:51:03 and there's this like guy standing there by the machine.
00:51:08 And he's like a disability, like deformed guy,
00:51:13 maybe like retarded or something, you know?
00:51:15 He's he had, you know, yeah, retarded people with this.
00:51:19 You can go to the gym, you can workout too.
00:51:20 That's not, I'm not judging you, man.
00:51:22 Even though you're creepy, even though you're shaped wrong
00:51:25 and a person should not look like you.
00:51:27 God did not grant you his favor, but that's all right.
00:51:29 Yeah, and he's like this weird like,
00:51:31 like he's like five foot tall
00:51:35 and he's got like this huge, like misshapen,
00:51:37 like bulbous head and like a sloped forehead
00:51:39 and like this weird dummy look.
00:51:41 And he's just oddly shaped in every way.
00:51:44 And he's just kind of staring blankly,
00:51:47 like in the way that a bad person does.
00:51:52 Okay, yeah, right.
00:51:53 So like I come back with my spray
00:51:55 and my paper towel to wipe down my seat
00:51:57 and he's just standing by the machine, staring at me,
00:52:01 like staring into my soul, like right into my eyes
00:52:03 and not saying anything.
00:52:05 And I'm just like trying to ignore it.
00:52:07 And I'm like awkwardly like just like silently like
00:52:10 patting down my seat.
00:52:11 Let's get this over with so I can get away from this guy.
00:52:13 And he, and he's just standing there.
00:52:14 And he's like really close to me now.
00:52:16 And he's like looking right in my eyes and I'm like, hi.
00:52:20 Like I just said like hi to like,
00:52:22 to give him, to satisfy him somehow,
00:52:24 give him the human acknowledgement
00:52:26 that he clearly craved.
00:52:27 And I'm like, hello.
00:52:29 And he's like, hello, hello.
00:52:33 And I'm like, oh my God, what does he want?
00:52:35 What does he want?
00:52:36 And I walk away and so I'm like, I'm walking.
00:52:41 I'm like, oh my God, I can't believe that.
00:52:42 What a weird guy.
00:52:43 What a fucking, and I'm like,
00:52:44 I thought for about like five to 10 minutes
00:52:47 I was thinking that's stupid son of a bitch.
00:52:49 That's fucking retard.
00:52:50 Fucking standing there staring at me.
00:52:52 Piece of shit.
00:52:52 What an asshole, fucking cocksucking bastard, motherfucker.
00:52:55 I hope he fucking dies.
00:52:56 And I'm like, I'm thinking like that
00:52:58 for like a good solid five to 10 minutes.
00:53:00 And after a while, all at once it hits me, wait.
00:53:04 I went and got the paper towel in the water
00:53:06 and I went to a different wait machine.
00:53:08 Oh!
00:53:11 And I was wiping down his seat.
00:53:14 That's why he was staring at me.
00:53:16 I was the retard in the story.
00:53:19 Wow.
00:53:20 And I still think about that late at night
00:53:22 when I can't sleep and I will for the rest of my life.
00:53:25 Like in that guy's world, he has a story about a retard
00:53:28 he met in the gym who just came up
00:53:30 and wiped his seat for no reason.
00:53:31 And the retard was me.
00:53:33 And he'll be telling that story
00:53:34 to all of his retard friends for the rest of time.
00:53:37 He's like that guy from Midsommar,
00:53:39 like the inbred guy who actually has the true wisdom
00:53:43 who can like touch God and convey God's message.
00:53:46 In this case, it's that,
00:53:48 bro, you're on my fucking machine, bro.
00:53:49 What are you doing?
00:53:50 What are you doing here?
00:53:52 I'm just thinking like how I would react,
00:53:55 like how furious I would be
00:53:57 if a stranger came up to my seat
00:53:59 and started wiping it, you know?
00:54:01 I mean, it would be a nightmare.
00:54:02 But that reminds me of the no man's land,
00:54:04 the nightmare scenario of there's two things.
00:54:06 One, where you like step away from your fucking machine
00:54:08 to go get a drink of water.
00:54:09 But the worst one of all is when you're mid-set
00:54:11 and you realize you have to poop.
00:54:13 And you're like, oh God,
00:54:15 this means I'm gonna be away from a machine
00:54:17 for like five to 10 minutes.
00:54:19 So you arrange like a full like barrier
00:54:22 of like your water bottle, your backpack.
00:54:24 I don't know, your fucking, your wrist wraps,
00:54:26 your weight belt, if you got it,
00:54:28 in like a semicircle around.
00:54:29 So everyone knows this is your machine.
00:54:31 And when you still walk, and still, despite that fact,
00:54:36 there's a percentage of the time when you'll come back
00:54:37 and there will be a guy who's like kicked it all aside
00:54:41 and is on the machine
00:54:42 and is now currently doing the exercise
00:54:44 and you have to have the talk.
00:54:46 Bunch of savages.
00:54:48 Bro, I'm so sorry.
00:54:51 I'm so sorry, I was away.
00:54:53 You're the one apologizing,
00:54:54 even though clearly he is in the wrong.
00:54:56 There's a conflict of morals here.
00:54:58 Yes, it is wrong to occupy a machine for too long,
00:55:01 but what's a man to do when you realize,
00:55:04 you can't work out when you have to poop or even pee.
00:55:07 It can't be done.
00:55:08 You have to step away.
00:55:09 It's one of the nightmares of the gym.
00:55:11 And then you have to have contact
00:55:13 with another person at the gym,
00:55:15 which is the ultimate worst situation possible.
00:55:19 The ultimate sin.
00:55:19 It can never be allowed.
00:55:22 And it's a nightmare, it's a nightmare.
00:55:23 I mean, when I was going to the gym,
00:55:25 I would go and look up the Planet Fitness
00:55:27 on the Google app and see the times it was least busy
00:55:31 and try and make sure I could fit that time into my schedule,
00:55:34 just optimize not having to see anybody.
00:55:37 Sure, sure.
00:55:39 Yeah.
00:55:39 Just didn't want to interact with people.
00:55:40 That's very wise.
00:55:41 Is Planet Fitness a 24 hour?
00:55:43 Yes.
00:55:44 Yeah.
00:55:45 Because I usually go like two in the morning.
00:55:47 Dude, my gym has 24 hour posts on it.
00:55:50 Do you know what that means?
00:55:52 Do you know what they mean by 24 hour?
00:55:53 They meant, in real fine print,
00:55:55 on weekdays, starting at 5 a.m. on Monday.
00:56:00 There have been, I think more times than not,
00:56:02 I have gone to the gym and it has been like Sunday night
00:56:05 at like 6 p.m. and the doors are fucking shuttered.
00:56:09 Cause oh, it's only 24 hours on the weekdays,
00:56:12 on Saturday and Sunday nights, we close early.
00:56:15 And I think Friday too.
00:56:17 These people, I'm gonna burn it down.
00:56:18 Next time this motherfucker happens,
00:56:20 I'm going to pour the bacon grease
00:56:22 from the Arby's next door all along the lines
00:56:24 and burn this motherfucker down,
00:56:26 create an explosion with all the fucking,
00:56:27 what is that stuff, the chalk,
00:56:29 the weight chalk for the barbells or whatever,
00:56:31 which obviously they don't have
00:56:32 cause it's a pussy gym, but whatever.
00:56:35 Fuck them, it's horrible.
00:56:36 You know, all this talk about Planet Fitness,
00:56:40 I'm realizing that I haven't been to the gym
00:56:42 in like almost like a year and a half.
00:56:45 My membership is still active
00:56:47 and I bet that even though they're all closed,
00:56:49 they're probably still charging me monthly,
00:56:51 even though none of them are open right now.
00:56:52 I got an email from Planet Fitness saying,
00:56:55 don't worry, we're not charging your cards during this time.
00:56:58 Okay, that's good.
00:57:00 I should check if mine is doing the same.
00:57:01 Thank God for that.
00:57:03 You better go to the gym soon Tom,
00:57:05 cause I've been waiting for the next Q and A.
00:57:08 I know dude, it's a nightmare, it's a nightmare,
00:57:10 but there's extraneous circumstances now.
00:57:14 Cause there's a gym that's actually right near me
00:57:17 because I used to live here years ago
00:57:19 and then I left and then I moved back.
00:57:21 But the gym right down the street is called Workout World
00:57:24 and back in the day, I had it like a subscription
00:57:28 or whatever, I was a member at Workout World
00:57:30 and then I moved away and I couldn't cancel my subscription
00:57:34 but I was like, hmm, I know
00:57:35 and I canceled my debit card
00:57:37 and I got a new one, so they stopped charging me.
00:57:40 So like four years ago, I owe like a hundred dollars
00:57:44 to Workout World and I never paid it back
00:57:46 and like it's still there on my credit report
00:57:48 but it did like nothing.
00:57:50 So I just, I got away with it.
00:57:52 I fucking got away with it, boy.
00:57:54 Well, you know, it's just that those practices,
00:57:56 okay, they've got their rules or whatever.
00:57:57 The fucking gym rules about like when you are
00:57:59 and are not allowed to cancel are so fucking draconian.
00:58:03 You have to like pay for like an extra month
00:58:05 before they'll let you leave or some shit.
00:58:07 Why can it not just be?
00:58:09 Hey, I'd like to cancel.
00:58:10 At the end of this month, please take me off.
00:58:11 Like every fucking time they make you pay
00:58:14 for at least one extra month.
00:58:16 Well, okay.
00:58:17 And there's a cancellation fee sometimes.
00:58:18 They locked me into a year contract.
00:58:20 Like they wouldn't let me sign, I don't know.
00:58:23 I guess I did sign up for a year contract
00:58:27 but like whatever, I used every tool at my disposal.
00:58:31 A gym's entire business model is subsidized
00:58:34 by fat people who sign up in January
00:58:37 and then never go again.
00:58:39 Yeah, I mean, you're right.
00:58:40 But they're not willing to cancel the subscription
00:58:42 because that's giving up.
00:58:43 That would feel bad.
00:58:44 Yeah, right, right.
00:58:44 No, it's true, it's true.
00:58:45 I don't blame the gyms.
00:58:46 That's a real thing.
00:58:47 That's a...
00:58:49 Sure.
00:58:50 It's happening.
00:58:50 But yeah, no, I don't want to be one of those guys.
00:58:53 Of course not.
00:58:54 Of course not.
00:58:54 So I won't work out.
00:58:55 I'll just cancel my subscription.
00:58:57 Just cancel my fucking debit card.
00:58:59 Better money, better idea.
00:59:00 Man, no, I keep thinking, I keep thinking
00:59:03 I should probably start lifting again.
00:59:05 It'll be depressing because I'll have to do it by myself.
00:59:07 But I'll probably feel better.
00:59:10 You will 100% feel better.
00:59:11 Everyone always feels better after the exercise.
00:59:14 It's true.
00:59:15 Yeah, yeah.
00:59:17 I gotta get the demons out somehow.
00:59:19 Exactly right.
00:59:20 I guess so.
00:59:21 I'm gonna do it, ladies and gentlemen.
00:59:22 Yeah, I'm gonna work out today.
00:59:23 I'm gonna get that.
00:59:24 It's gonna happen.
00:59:25 You're welcome.
00:59:26 Feel free to hold me to it.
00:59:27 You gotta call our mom today.
00:59:28 Oh, true.
00:59:29 But I've got, when was that, six we said?
00:59:32 Okay, I've made about six, yeah.
00:59:34 I think I'll have time beforehand.
00:59:36 An hour and 44 minutes from right now.
00:59:38 Tick, tick, tick.
00:59:39 In case you're wondering.
00:59:40 The doomsday clock marches ever onward.
00:59:42 Has anyone used Zoom?
00:59:43 Do I need to be scared or intimidated about setting up Zoom?
00:59:47 I don't think so.
00:59:47 I've never used it.
00:59:48 I haven't used it.
00:59:49 Both my parents are, and they're idiots.
00:59:50 I'm at the age now.
00:59:52 I'm not learning any new apps or social media things.
00:59:57 I don't care.
00:59:58 Discord would do this job.
00:59:59 I wish they just had Discord, but I don't know.
01:00:01 Whatever comes out past this point, I'm not interested.
01:00:05 I'm not gonna be a part of it.
01:00:06 This is what it means to truly become an adult,
01:00:08 to give up on trying to follow trends.
01:00:10 Say, this is it, I'm planting my flag, not moving.
01:00:15 There's like two levels of getting old.
01:00:18 There's one where you hear about the new thing
01:00:20 and you reject it.
01:00:21 And then it's when you get to a point where you're so old
01:00:23 that you don't even know anything.
01:00:26 And you say, yeah, sure, why not?
01:00:28 And that's why all the really old,
01:00:30 my parents are on Zoom doing talks with their friends.
01:00:33 You know, up to the point.
01:00:35 I've resented, yeah.
01:00:36 What am I supposed to be excited about with Zoom?
01:00:38 Like, we already got nothing.
01:00:40 You can do video conferencing in Discord.
01:00:42 You can do it through Google Hangouts.
01:00:44 There's already things that do the same thing.
01:00:46 I think it has some new features of,
01:00:48 you can have tons of screens on screen at once
01:00:51 or something that's different.
01:00:52 Zoom didn't require login at the beginning.
01:00:55 So if you didn't have an account,
01:00:57 you can just still use it.
01:00:58 You can still go join other sessions and stuff.
01:01:00 So that's why it kind of rose above.
01:01:02 But this is just lower barrier of entry.
01:01:04 Yeah, that's nice.
01:01:04 It's free.
01:01:05 You don't have to sign up.
01:01:06 Well, low barrier, you know what?
01:01:07 I guess low barrier of entry really is a feature.
01:01:10 It is.
01:01:11 Like, I guess that's why.
01:01:12 It's arguably the most important one for mass appeal.
01:01:14 Yep, yep.
01:01:15 Hey, on the getting old thing,
01:01:17 up to this, I'll plant my flag.
01:01:19 Up to this point, I have famously resisted the idea
01:01:23 of a Gurren login sequel.
01:01:25 But now, I suddenly realized that Gurren login
01:01:28 only covered two of the important stages
01:01:30 of development of a man.
01:01:31 One is when you go from childhood to adulthood
01:01:34 and you improve yourself and learn how you can affect
01:01:37 the world and make positive change.
01:01:39 Part two is when you, as an adult,
01:01:42 have to recognize that the world is an imperfect place
01:01:45 that your power will not be enough
01:01:47 to just change the entire world all the time.
01:01:49 You have to play within the system to a degree.
01:01:52 But I need a sequel.
01:01:52 Mate, that sounds like the worst fucking sequel
01:01:54 to Gurren login.
01:01:55 That's not the exact opposite of what it should be.
01:01:57 Well, first of all, that's already the show bed.
01:01:59 That's already the show.
01:02:00 Yeah, that's part two.
01:02:02 Yeah, like, Spiral Power itself is not enough.
01:02:04 It would destroy the world.
01:02:06 It would destroy the universe.
01:02:07 But we need a true sequel.
01:02:08 When is, in fact, when Cevote is an old man
01:02:10 and you begin to resent those
01:02:12 who are now trying to change the world
01:02:14 and you hate that they're exerting any influence
01:02:16 and it makes you mad.
01:02:17 And does he become, what's his name?
01:02:20 What's the fucking old guy's name?
01:02:23 Sigmund Freud, a grandpa from the Simpsons.
01:02:25 The guy who ends up as a head in a jar.
01:02:27 Oh, Lord Genome, Lord Genome.
01:02:29 Does he become the new Lord Genome?
01:02:31 Well-bent, famously, I busted this wide open
01:02:33 that really Lord Genome is just like Rossiu,
01:02:36 that he's not like anti-change.
01:02:38 He's just protectionist and he views his rigid control
01:02:42 of the world simply as a means of protection.
01:02:44 But now it's not about protection.
01:02:45 It's about hating people who are just making things new
01:02:48 and complicated and that makes you mad.
01:02:51 And that's what I want.
01:02:52 I can't wait for Nate to last Jedi Gurren Lagan
01:02:55 and take a beloved protagonist
01:02:57 and turn his ideals on its head.
01:02:59 That's again, that's what I want.
01:03:00 On her agenda, sounds great.
01:03:01 That's great, that's called maturity.
01:03:04 Look it up sometime.
01:03:05 UrbanDictionary.com defines maturity
01:03:08 as whatever Nate just said and it feels good.
01:03:10 Okay, sick.
01:03:12 Actually, I'm curious.
01:03:13 Maturity is defined as what Urban Dictionary doesn't have.
01:03:18 It's nice, cool.
01:03:19 That's a great, that's really funny Urban Dictionary.
01:03:22 That's a real dad joke in our show.
01:03:26 Hey, you know what I did today?
01:03:28 What's that?
01:03:29 I bought 500,000 bells worth of turnips.
01:03:35 Okay.
01:03:36 My entire attic is filled with turnips.
01:03:40 And God, please don't make me lose my investment.
01:03:44 Somebody last week commented,
01:03:46 Animal Crossing is the new politics of this show.
01:03:50 Hey, that's an improvement.
01:03:52 Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
01:03:55 Market spike.
01:03:56 Market spike.
01:03:57 Market spike.
01:03:59 I have yet to purchase my first turnip,
01:04:00 but this Sunday, I'm gonna keep my eyes peeled.
01:04:03 I've got like 200K in the bank.
01:04:05 I'm a risk at all.
01:04:06 Today is, Nate, today is Sunday.
01:04:08 Oh my God.
01:04:09 Oh, she's already gone, isn't she?
01:04:10 She already left, God damn it.
01:04:12 You fucking idiot.
01:04:13 Shit.
01:04:14 She left at noon.
01:04:16 Next Sunday then.
01:04:18 Hey, speaking of it being Sunday
01:04:21 and having something in the bank,
01:04:23 guess what tonight is?
01:04:25 It's money in the bank.
01:04:27 It's a wrestling topic.
01:04:28 Oh yeah.
01:04:29 Is this the one with the suitcase talking about?
01:04:31 It's the annual WWE Money in the Bank pay-per-view.
01:04:36 And it's cool.
01:04:37 I love wrestling and fucking wrestling
01:04:41 because of the coronavirus and the quarantine
01:04:44 is going insane, like all of it, everywhere.
01:04:48 Yeah, it's just empty rooms, right?
01:04:50 Yeah, it's mostly empty arenas.
01:04:54 The other day, they did like a,
01:04:56 Matt Hardy made his debut for AEW
01:05:00 and he ended up running over Sammy Guevara in a golf cart.
01:05:03 Look at this fucking sick picture I'm uploading here
01:05:07 in a minute.
01:05:08 Yeah, right.
01:05:09 And you fucking suck it now.
01:05:10 Come on, piece of shit.
01:05:12 First of all, I've gotta react to this.
01:05:14 Sephiroth, Happy Mother's Day.
01:05:16 Out of my way, I'm gonna post that to my mom
01:05:19 and hope she gets it.
01:05:21 I see this image still loading.
01:05:23 What a piece of shit.
01:05:24 It doesn't sound like, I can't see the large image,
01:05:27 but I see a boy as a young lad
01:05:29 being running away from crazy Matt Hardy
01:05:32 in a golf cart.
01:05:33 Yes, that's what I'm trying to post.
01:05:36 Who else is there in the cart?
01:05:37 Okay, so that's Kenny Omega riding shotgun,
01:05:41 hanging out the cart, saying to Sammy Guevara
01:05:43 who's running away in a straight line
01:05:45 like in that movie that everyone hates, Prometheus.
01:05:47 Prometheus, whatever, yeah.
01:05:49 He could just run to the left or the right
01:05:51 to get away from the golf cart.
01:05:52 Kenny is hanging out shotgun, pointing at him,
01:05:55 saying, we're gonna fucking kill you.
01:05:58 Matt Hardy, of course, is laughing like a maniac as he does.
01:06:02 Like, right before he did it,
01:06:03 Matt Hardy got in the golf cart
01:06:05 and he looked to the cameras
01:06:07 because this was all happening live.
01:06:08 It wasn't like a pre-taped thing, like usual.
01:06:11 So there was no way to fake this.
01:06:12 Like, he really got hit with this golf cart
01:06:14 and it looked fucking brutal.
01:06:17 Yeah, that's a serious blow.
01:06:19 So when Matt Hardy was getting in the golf cart,
01:06:23 he looked at the camera and he said,
01:06:25 I need you to document these events.
01:06:28 And the commentators were like,
01:06:31 we are Matt, it's on TV, this is live TV.
01:06:35 We are documenting it.
01:06:38 So that's fucking great.
01:06:39 You've got people on that show
01:06:41 running each other over with golf carts
01:06:42 and the money in the bank pay-per-view, that's tonight.
01:06:45 So normally what the money in the bank pay-per-view is,
01:06:48 is that there's, it's a ladder match
01:06:50 with like six to eight guys, you know,
01:06:52 however many they can cram in there.
01:06:54 And they're all scrambling to get up the ladder
01:06:56 and grab the briefcase,
01:06:57 because the briefcase has a contract for a title match.
01:07:00 So that's what they do every year at around this time.
01:07:03 But this year, because everyone is losing
01:07:06 their fucking minds with cabin fever
01:07:09 and we have to keep coming up with waste to entertain ourselves
01:07:12 or else we'll all commit fucking suicide.
01:07:15 Instead of doing just a ladder match for an empty arena,
01:07:17 which would be like totally pointless and stupid,
01:07:20 they're doing the money in the bank entire pay-per-view
01:07:24 from the WWE corporate offices in Stamford, Connecticut,
01:07:29 which is just like a big corporate office building.
01:07:32 And they're starting at the first floor of the building
01:07:35 and they're gonna fight their way to the roof.
01:07:37 And I guess the briefcase will be on the roof.
01:07:40 And I am like, I'm 99% certain somebody's going off
01:07:45 of the fucking roof and somebody's going to die.
01:07:50 Did you say how many floors it was?
01:07:52 It's a tower, it's like a skyscraper.
01:07:54 It's a tower, okay, okay.
01:07:56 Yeah.
01:07:58 Oh my God, the image finally load.
01:07:59 Matt Hardy's manic fucking grin on his face is,
01:08:03 that's good shit, that's good shit.
01:08:05 Who's this boy running from him again?
01:08:07 That's Sammy Guevara, the Spanish God.
01:08:10 Oh, does he have a gun?
01:08:12 No, it's just hand pointing.
01:08:13 I thought it was a gun too.
01:08:15 Okay, I was just looking at a gun.
01:08:18 Well look, just shoot him.
01:08:20 He does point like a gun, like that is his thing, so.
01:08:23 Okay, it looks like he's holding a gun.
01:08:26 So in Canon, it's a gun, yeah, sure.
01:08:28 It's like an invisible fucking gun that he has.
01:08:31 Oh, okay.
01:08:31 Points at people before he runs them over.
01:08:34 Yeah.
01:08:37 Fantastic.
01:08:38 Wrestling's cool.
01:08:38 Well, keep me posted.
01:08:39 I wanna know what the fuck happens in that.
01:08:43 Does someone go over the roof?
01:08:45 I'm 90% certain someone will go over
01:08:47 and I'm 99% certain that if someone does,
01:08:50 it'll be AJ Styles.
01:08:51 Because he was the one who got buried by the undertaker
01:08:55 at Wrestlemania, he got buried alive.
01:08:58 And then he just recently showed up again,
01:08:59 not mentioning it.
01:09:02 So like totally like, yeah, whatever, I'm still here.
01:09:05 I got buried alive and murdered, but I'm still fine.
01:09:07 And also the other two guys in the match,
01:09:10 Gals and Anderson, who the undertaker also murdered
01:09:12 in that match, they were shortly after they were let go
01:09:16 of the company because of like Corona layoffs.
01:09:18 So they were fired, so they didn't show up again.
01:09:21 So in Canon, they are just dead.
01:09:23 Like they were never seen again.
01:09:25 Undertaker murdered them.
01:09:26 So AJ Styles was buried alive and killed
01:09:29 and both of his best friends are killed
01:09:30 and he just shows up and he's like, yeah, I'm better now.
01:09:34 And now we're gonna climb to the tower
01:09:36 and he's probably gonna fall off again.
01:09:37 And like I'm hoping that AJ Styles' new gimmick
01:09:39 is just that he's like immortal now
01:09:42 and he falls off towers and yeah,
01:09:45 it's gonna be fucking dope.
01:09:46 Wrestling's fucking rad.
01:09:48 Hey, by the way, I was just gonna say
01:09:49 about the Animal Crossing thing before.
01:09:51 Ben, Munchie, I and Kazzy,
01:09:54 we all visited each other's islands the other day
01:09:57 in Animal Crossing and it was a great time.
01:10:00 And it was fucking sick as hell and I loved doing it.
01:10:05 And we all hung out on various places
01:10:07 and we all went to each other's islands.
01:10:09 We went to each other's islands.
01:10:10 We traded fruit. We exchanged fruit.
01:10:12 I now have all the fruits, it feels great.
01:10:14 Here's me, Munchie and Ben all gathered in front of my island
01:10:18 or my flag on the island of Prophesia.
01:10:20 I kept trying to give you pears
01:10:23 but eating them by accident.
01:10:24 Oh yeah, he kept eating the, he had three pears.
01:10:26 He put one down on the ground and said,
01:10:28 okay, Kazzy, he was giving me the Kazzy.
01:10:29 I'm gonna now give you one.
01:10:30 Proceeds to eat the fucking bear.
01:10:33 Okay, I will now do it again.
01:10:35 Eats the other one.
01:10:36 Well.
01:10:37 I found some extras though.
01:10:41 I now have them all planted.
01:10:42 I cannot wait for them to bloom.
01:10:43 I'm gonna make orchards.
01:10:44 It's gonna be sick.
01:10:45 It's gonna be great.
01:10:46 Don't you have to like pay for online?
01:10:48 Yeah, I do.
01:10:49 You did it.
01:10:50 I fucking did it.
01:10:51 I paid Nintendo 20 of my American dollars for one year.
01:10:57 Ben is simping hard for Nintendo right now.
01:10:59 I went for the full year.
01:11:01 I forget who it is.
01:11:03 It's like $9 for a month
01:11:05 or you can just do like 20 bucks for the whole year.
01:11:07 That's not bad.
01:11:08 That's not bad.
01:11:09 It's pretty fun.
01:11:10 It's fun.
01:11:11 Like years ago or like a year ago.
01:11:13 I spent like, I spent $300 on the,
01:11:15 like contributing to the RFCK Kickstarter.
01:11:19 So like whatever, doesn't matter.
01:11:21 I mean, I just got a deal.
01:11:22 I forget when.
01:11:23 We were talking about Switch stuff years ago
01:11:25 and I think someone in the PCP comments just said,
01:11:27 like, hey Nate, I'm on a family plan.
01:11:29 I have an extra slot.
01:11:30 I can just add you for free and you get Nintendo online.
01:11:34 I was like, okay, let's do it.
01:11:36 Let's do it.
01:11:37 So I just have, comment on this video.
01:11:39 I forget who it is, who is doing it, but you are.
01:11:41 Yeah, someone did that for me as well, which is pretty based.
01:11:43 It is thoroughly based.
01:11:45 No doubt about it.
01:11:45 So thank you.
01:11:46 Thank you.
01:11:47 It's helping me hang out with my boys on the internet
01:11:51 and it feels good.
01:11:52 But has no one got a comment on my flag?
01:11:54 My flag that I'm so proud of for proficient?
01:11:56 Oh, I already did.
01:11:58 I still have this amazing wrestling image full screen.
01:12:01 So I didn't even see the next one.
01:12:02 Scroll down and look at my flag.
01:12:05 Haha, it says gay epic.
01:12:07 The R street is stunning.
01:12:09 Thank you.
01:12:10 That's all I wanted.
01:12:11 That's all I, just an acknowledgement.
01:12:12 Thank you, thank you.
01:12:13 And I don't know why the image is sideways.
01:12:15 I will fix that for the leg of the show notes.
01:12:19 All right, well, that's all I had to say
01:12:21 about Animal Crossing.
01:12:22 It's a great time and I can't wait to develop my land more.
01:12:25 Oh, I've got chrysanthemums.
01:12:27 I'm gonna breed more chrysanthemums.
01:12:28 Hazy and Munchies land is like a barren wasteland.
01:12:32 It's like an undeveloped third world country.
01:12:35 It is embarrassing.
01:12:36 It's a disaster zone.
01:12:37 Didn't they just start playing?
01:12:38 Yeah, I know.
01:12:40 No excuses, no excuse.
01:12:41 But it's funny to say it.
01:12:43 Here's the punchline to my wrestling anecdote.
01:12:45 Someone already made a meme of the image
01:12:48 of Sammy running from the golf cart.
01:12:51 There it is, there it is, everybody.
01:12:53 This is just such a boomer meme.
01:12:55 But what can you say?
01:12:56 What more could you expect from R slash memes
01:12:59 by you slash glorious Gilmore?
01:13:03 Thank you, sir.
01:13:04 For your contribution.
01:13:05 William Gilmore, he's a critical role fan.
01:13:08 God damn it.
01:13:09 The fact that the meme maker's name is on it
01:13:11 makes it better and I hope no one would cut that off.
01:13:14 I think he's so proud of this meme.
01:13:18 I hope he forever gets credit for it.
01:13:20 Wait, did you think he manually added that
01:13:22 or is that just like something
01:13:23 that's automatically generated via R memes?
01:13:26 I hope he manually added it.
01:13:27 That would, I mean, he really should have watermarked this.
01:13:29 He doesn't.
01:13:30 No, that's gotta be an auto gen thing.
01:13:32 Well, for sure.
01:13:34 They're doing God's work either way.
01:13:35 Meme attribution is just cringe in general.
01:13:38 Just like memes are meant to be,
01:13:40 memes are in the public domain by default.
01:13:42 Memes are the new currency though, Tom.
01:13:44 They're the new social credit score.
01:13:46 This is what we'll be using when the lockdown ends.
01:13:50 We're transitioned to a new government style
01:13:52 where it's based on your gamer score, basically.
01:13:54 And that's what I want.
01:13:55 You're telling me that we're,
01:13:56 out of all the possible systems we could implement,
01:13:59 we found the one thing that was worse
01:14:01 than capitalism and went with it?
01:14:02 I sure hope so.
01:14:03 It sounds great to me. God damn it.
01:14:05 You know what?
01:14:06 Sometimes there's threads on V on 4chan
01:14:08 about like how many platinum trophies you've gotten
01:14:10 speaking of gamer scores.
01:14:11 It dawns on me.
01:14:13 I don't think I've ever gotten a platinum trophy
01:14:16 on any of like my PS4 games and, you know, it should-
01:14:19 Because you do things with your life, Nate.
01:14:20 It bothers me a little bit
01:14:22 that I've never gotten a platinum trophy.
01:14:24 Just a, not even one.
01:14:27 I know I shouldn't care, but I kind of do-
01:14:29 Time for the new saga of Nate
01:14:31 trying to get one platinum trophy.
01:14:33 Okay, I've committed-
01:14:33 I mean, you'd platinum Kingdom Hearts too, of course.
01:14:36 That would be the game to platinum for you.
01:14:38 There are games that I have definitely done everything in.
01:14:41 The first one I ever did was Super Mario Bros.
01:14:43 2 Advance for GBA.
01:14:45 I did literally everything in that game
01:14:47 and I got all the check marks on the thing.
01:14:50 God, that felt good.
01:14:51 You know, I feel so like ripped off by the world.
01:14:55 Like, I used to 100% games all the time.
01:14:59 Back in the day, before there were no trophies,
01:15:01 before there was proof that you could fucking show people.
01:15:03 Now all these kids, you know,
01:15:05 they get these fucking participation trophies
01:15:08 that they get for everything
01:15:09 and they just go, oh, look what I got.
01:15:11 I got a nice little thing on Icon on my PS4
01:15:14 for doing a thing in a game
01:15:15 that any fucking baby shit could do.
01:15:17 You know, you get a damn trophy nowadays
01:15:20 when you're just watching a cutscene.
01:15:21 Back in my days, I fucking 100%
01:15:23 a goddamn Donkey Kong 54 and I didn't get shit for it.
01:15:26 Oh, and that's a grind to fucking 100% that shit.
01:15:28 Jesus Christ.
01:15:30 I believe I, no, I didn't 100% it,
01:15:33 but I was replaying Banjo.
01:15:34 I didn't even beat Banjo 2e
01:15:36 because I got a little bit bored, like halfway through.
01:15:38 Banjo Kazooie, I loved
01:15:40 and was happy to like basically 100% that.
01:15:42 I got the fucking ice key, man.
01:15:45 I got the fucking eggs and shit,
01:15:46 as many as you can get by entering those fucking passwords
01:15:49 in the horrible ass fucking password
01:15:52 entry thing in the sandcastle.
01:15:53 Oh, Jesus Christ.
01:15:55 That's a fucking Vietnam flashback.
01:15:57 Just take the 10 minutes to enter those.
01:16:00 Yeah, that sucked.
01:16:02 But I did it, man.
01:16:03 I needed to complete it.
01:16:04 So yeah, I guess that's 100% completion.
01:16:08 They should like, if you get like a platinum trophy,
01:16:10 they should send you a physical trophy.
01:16:14 It should be like getting a plaque on YouTube.
01:16:17 You should get some certificate of achievement.
01:16:19 Maybe they could print out or something.
01:16:21 No, because that could be faked.
01:16:22 That shit can be faked.
01:16:23 You need an actual signed,
01:16:24 but like the Dean of Video Games at Video Game College
01:16:28 should give you an award.
01:16:30 Yeah, I agree.
01:16:31 So that when I apply.
01:16:32 Melt down the disc and turn it into a trophy.
01:16:36 There's no reason to play anymore.
01:16:37 Yeah, it makes sense.
01:16:39 When you 100% the game, you have no need for it anymore.
01:16:42 The PS4 just starts spinning really fast
01:16:44 and it just melts your disc into a trophy
01:16:46 and spits it back out.
01:16:47 I mean, we talked about enlightenment.
01:16:48 The video game exists, right?
01:16:49 To just feed you visual and auditory and input,
01:16:53 tactile feedback.
01:16:54 Once you've absorbed all that information,
01:16:57 you're just that step closer to enlightenment.
01:17:00 And yeah, there is no need for it to exist anymore.
01:17:02 You could just give it away or whatever.
01:17:04 But I was thinking about this because
01:17:06 I was looking at the trophy selection for the FF7 remake
01:17:10 since I beat like the super boss.
01:17:12 And I feel in myself, I have done the biggest
01:17:16 and most important things in the game,
01:17:18 but then they're like,
01:17:19 well, why don't you play every chapter on hard mode?
01:17:21 I'm like, hard mode isn't even hard in this game.
01:17:24 It's just annoying with the like MP conservation thing.
01:17:28 And I already found a way to exploit the system,
01:17:30 which is just when you find one of those boxes
01:17:33 that you break to get MP back,
01:17:35 you just break it, get the MP, save and reload the game.
01:17:39 And the box just reappears.
01:17:41 So you can just do that as much as you want.
01:17:43 Cause it's terrible game design in my opinion.
01:17:45 It's not challenging.
01:17:46 It's just annoying.
01:17:47 So I don't know, I don't feel bad about it at all.
01:17:49 Point is, point is,
01:17:50 there's a bunch of these fucking challenges
01:17:52 that aren't even fun.
01:17:53 Like when I first did the like the Don Corneo raid,
01:17:57 yeah, I got everyone's worst dress.
01:17:59 I got Tifa's worst dress and heiresses and clouds.
01:18:01 But then I did it again and I got their best dresses.
01:18:04 And now the game wants me to go through it again
01:18:07 and get the middle dresses.
01:18:09 No, no, I don't have time for that.
01:18:11 That's fucking annoying.
01:18:13 I had to go back stupid.
01:18:14 And do like, because I missed one of the Colosseum battles
01:18:19 in Corneo, like the, one of the extra heiress battles.
01:18:23 So I had to like, I had to, first I went back
01:18:25 to like the chapter before you saw him the tower,
01:18:28 thinking like, okay, I'll go back here
01:18:30 and I'll do all the Colosseum battles.
01:18:31 Well, you can't select heiress
01:18:33 cause she's not in your party at that chapter.
01:18:35 So I had to go back to the chapter
01:18:37 where you're in wall market with her.
01:18:38 So I go back to that chapter thinking,
01:18:40 okay, I gotta do her two stupid battles in this thing.
01:18:43 Well, it starts you out at the beginning of the chapter.
01:18:46 The Colosseum battle is at the end of the fucking chapter.
01:18:49 I had to do the whole stupid shit all over again,
01:18:51 going around talking to people and putting on dresses.
01:18:54 Not good, make me mad, make me mad, make me sad.
01:18:58 One of these things doesn't make the,
01:18:59 like this doesn't make the game like awful,
01:19:01 but because the game is structured this way in chapters,
01:19:04 that's been the story of my fucking life.
01:19:06 Like replaying sections of the chapter
01:19:08 in order to get to the place where I can now do things.
01:19:11 We used to just call this end game content
01:19:13 and you could just do it all at the end.
01:19:15 But because we got chapters here,
01:19:17 that's just like a unique annoyance
01:19:18 of this particular style of game.
01:19:20 I mean, it's not the end of the world,
01:19:21 but it was fucking annoying.
01:19:22 And now that I beat the secret boss,
01:19:24 I think I clocked in 75 hours to beat all this shit,
01:19:27 to finish like everything of note in the game
01:19:30 as far as I'm concerned.
01:19:32 And I don't know, Superboss was pretty fun.
01:19:35 I enjoyed it, but that chapter shit
01:19:38 was full of the fucking birds.
01:19:39 I don't even want to complain anymore.
01:19:40 It's just gonna give me more shitty comments
01:19:42 I have to fucking respond to.
01:19:44 Yeah.
01:19:46 See, I don't know, all things like that,
01:19:48 I mean, when I make my video, I'm gonna mention that,
01:19:50 but none of that is like a big deal.
01:19:52 Like any fucking game has imperfections, you know?
01:19:55 Like you ever like, you see a comment of someone
01:19:57 who's like so wrong and like so aggressively hostile
01:20:01 with their wrongness, like you have to respond to it.
01:20:05 So like, you do that thing where you're so fucking mad
01:20:09 that you take each fucking line
01:20:10 and you respond to every line with a fucking paragraph
01:20:13 explaining exactly why the person's fucking wrong.
01:20:15 And then I got it and I got this like massive retort
01:20:18 and I'm looking at it, it's like after,
01:20:20 like by the time I'm finished writing it,
01:20:22 I don't even want to post it anymore.
01:20:23 And it just sits there and I'm like,
01:20:25 well, what the fuck do I do with this now?
01:20:27 I don't know, save it for a fucking script later, I guess.
01:20:30 So like, it's like, I don't want to click post
01:20:33 because like there's no point
01:20:33 because then he'll just respond to it
01:20:35 and I'll be caught in the loop forever.
01:20:37 So like I tab over and then I'd like go about my day,
01:20:41 I don't have the spirit to,
01:20:42 I don't have the strength of will
01:20:44 to just close that tab and just forget about it.
01:20:46 So the comment stays up, unposted in that tab.
01:20:49 And then it happens again later in the week
01:20:50 with a different comment.
01:20:51 And then I just got multiple tabs up of like comment wars
01:20:56 that only I know about that even the other person
01:20:58 in the comment thread doesn't know is happening
01:21:00 that only I have to bear the weight of and live with.
01:21:04 I have done that.
01:21:04 This is why every site has to adopt
01:21:07 the way Newgrounds does comments.
01:21:09 It's perfect.
01:21:10 Which is what?
01:21:11 Because on Newgrounds, someone leaves a comment
01:21:14 and then the artist, only the artist,
01:21:18 the person uploading the content can respond once.
01:21:21 Oh my God, you're describing a perfect world time.
01:21:24 You're describing everything I've ever wanted yet.
01:21:25 It exists on Newgrounds.com.
01:21:27 I would sell my fucking soul to have that on YouTube.
01:21:31 You know, the only thing is I,
01:21:34 when I see a comment like that, there are some comments
01:21:37 that they say a certain thing.
01:21:38 And I know for them to have reached this conclusion,
01:21:42 there has to be so many things,
01:21:43 like I can see their whole history arcing backward
01:21:47 to know like all the things that have happened in their life
01:21:49 that have led them to this point.
01:21:51 And all the like skewed perspectives
01:21:53 they have to have brought to the table
01:21:54 to have interpreted what I was saying
01:21:56 in this particular way.
01:21:57 And luckily I'm able most of the time
01:22:00 to quickly do the calculus in my head of,
01:22:01 okay, I know in order to express my point
01:22:04 and correct this person,
01:22:05 it would take me way too much time.
01:22:08 Because like you can't even just tell them
01:22:10 the thing they got wrong and expect them to understand it.
01:22:13 That's not enough.
01:22:14 You have to like do the detective work
01:22:15 of like telling them what happened in their life
01:22:19 and why their entire perspective on the world
01:22:21 has been wrong from day one in excruciating detail.
01:22:26 I feel that a lot, I feel that a lot.
01:22:30 Well, hey, we've been talking for a while.
01:22:31 If you want, we got voicemails.
01:22:33 We can go to them unless anybody else wants to, you know.
01:22:35 Let's fucking do it, dawg.
01:22:37 Yeah, let's make it happen.
01:22:38 Okay, just a moment, I'll bring them up.
01:22:40 Speak pipe, link, ladies and gentlemen,
01:22:43 down in the description.
01:22:44 Let me just mention about the RFC kick starter.
01:22:47 We won, we won the game.
01:22:49 We did it.
01:22:50 Day one, you guys made like 7,000, 5,000, right?
01:22:53 7, 20, 7, 250?
01:22:56 Right.
01:22:56 It's like 7,000 change.
01:22:58 I donated a bunch at the end to meet that last goal.
01:23:01 And we're gonna make like a million fucking,
01:23:03 I'm going to, have I talked about talking
01:23:06 to the fucking Chinese people on alibaba.com?
01:23:09 Not here, so yeah, clarify.
01:23:11 I have like talking to a bunch of people
01:23:13 and like I have to haggle with them.
01:23:15 I have to like, I've been talking to one,
01:23:18 been like, shipping is like that much?
01:23:20 Like, ah, you could get me a better shipping rate, right?
01:23:22 And she's like, oh, it's kind of high right now
01:23:24 because of COVID, but like maybe if we like
01:23:26 order in like a month, then maybe it'll be lower.
01:23:28 Like, okay, just give me the sample.
01:23:30 And talk to this other guy who's like, okay,
01:23:32 we can make you these, but they'll be cheaper,
01:23:35 but they'll be iron, but that's okay.
01:23:38 But because they're iron, we can only cut certain shapes.
01:23:40 Like, we can't cut all these shapes.
01:23:42 You can only cut like most of these shapes.
01:23:43 It's like, ah, okay.
01:23:45 So it's like, okay, maybe we'll go with those
01:23:47 for like some of them.
01:23:48 And these, this other guy for some others.
01:23:51 I don't know.
01:23:52 It's very complicated.
01:23:53 I've been like going back and forth
01:23:54 with a whole bunch of fucking people.
01:23:56 The struggle is real.
01:23:57 This will be a sad one.
01:23:58 The struggle is real, but we're gonna make like,
01:24:00 when I've make the order, and like a couple of weeks
01:24:03 or a month from now, I'm going to be receiving like,
01:24:05 like dozens of pounds of like huge bags of like
01:24:09 thousands of items, and I'm going to hold them
01:24:12 and dive into them like Scrooge McDuck.
01:24:15 I personally put down $60 for like seven pins or something.
01:24:21 He jumped into a bunch of pins.
01:24:22 So they're gonna have like the things.
01:24:24 No, I'm gonna take those off.
01:24:26 I'm gonna take those off first.
01:24:27 You want the real shit, the raw experience.
01:24:30 And that's what I'm gonna do with my seven pins
01:24:32 added to my pin pile.
01:24:34 I'm definitely getting the slime corp pin,
01:24:35 which is the only canonical pin that already exists
01:24:38 in Canon.
01:24:39 So that's the good one, obviously.
01:24:41 I guess so, yeah.
01:24:42 And I gotta get the big coin.
01:24:43 I want a big old fucking slime.
01:24:45 You get the big coin.
01:24:46 Is the final vote up?
01:24:48 Is it counted?
01:24:51 I wanna know if that gun girl pin is actually gonna be
01:24:54 made or not.
01:24:56 Okay.
01:24:57 Well, this might be the final vote.
01:25:00 And let me, let me, let me, let me, let me,
01:25:02 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
01:25:03 The final,
01:25:04 I mean, if you have to look things up.
01:25:05 No, I don't have to, I'll just need to look at the fricking,
01:25:09 just look at the vote and see what's going on there.
01:25:13 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
01:25:14 The voting booth.
01:25:16 Okay, I said in the chat that it was like the vote for four.
01:25:20 I think it's actually gonna be at least,
01:25:22 if there's no new designs,
01:25:26 then I think it'll be for at least seven,
01:25:29 possibly more.
01:25:30 So like, it looks like probably gun girl will get made.
01:25:35 She has 15 votes.
01:25:37 And there are a bunch with more than that right now,
01:25:39 it looks like.
01:25:40 Hold on, hold on, hold on.
01:25:41 Like seven more pins will get added.
01:25:45 I think we funded, we needed to vote for four
01:25:49 when the poll went up,
01:25:51 but then we hit three more during the stream,
01:25:53 I think, unless I have that wrong.
01:25:55 So yeah, I think seven.
01:25:58 So what is this?
01:25:58 It looks like the top votes now are four.
01:26:01 Gun girl is number four.
01:26:02 Number 10 is the top one, I think.
01:26:03 The slime heart, the levy, jevy, stay dead.
01:26:10 The mega slime.
01:26:12 The mega slime, gun girl, and then.
01:26:16 Six, which means.
01:26:18 Investor.
01:26:19 Right, right.
01:26:20 Kola already picked can man.
01:26:22 I think Kola already picked can man as her choice,
01:26:25 so I'm gonna skip that one.
01:26:28 And then, wait, E is mega slime.
01:26:31 Looks like you're in the clear with gun girl though.
01:26:33 It looks, yeah, probably.
01:26:35 More or less.
01:26:36 By the way, can I, is there a number of times
01:26:38 I'm allowed to vote?
01:26:39 Cause there's a couple I just wanna throw a vote on,
01:26:40 just for fun.
01:26:41 No, you freaking ding dong.
01:26:42 You vote for any, vote for as many as you want.
01:26:44 Okay, just check.
01:26:45 Like the point is that if everyone just votes yes
01:26:48 on the ones that they would want.
01:26:49 They all evens out anyway, right?
01:26:51 Yeah.
01:26:51 Then the ones that will get made will be the ones
01:26:53 that the most people want.
01:26:54 Right, I thought so.
01:26:54 Okay, okay, cool.
01:26:55 So yeah, vote for as many as you want.
01:26:56 Sick.
01:26:57 Well, there you go.
01:26:58 I mean, so if you pledged, did you,
01:27:00 I assume you pledged, Gib.
01:27:01 How much did you, how many pins did you spring for?
01:27:03 Gib pledged, Gib was like the first one to pledge.
01:27:05 Yeah.
01:27:06 Yeah.
01:27:07 I was excited.
01:27:08 Cause I knew, cause it's like, they're cool.
01:27:11 How many pins did you get though?
01:27:11 I have a place for pins.
01:27:14 I think I'm getting 13,
01:27:16 but like two of those count for the challenge coin.
01:27:18 Oh yeah, right, right.
01:27:19 Yeah.
01:27:20 Sick.
01:27:21 So yeah, a bunch.
01:27:22 Nice.
01:27:24 Well, congratulations on a successful Kickstarter, Ben.
01:27:28 Yay.
01:27:29 It is very nice.
01:27:30 I just had to update you.
01:27:31 Another one I've supported.
01:27:31 By the way, I just want to say,
01:27:32 I really think that this like Kickstarter
01:27:34 for specific projects thing is a smart way to go business-wise.
01:27:38 That's what Kickstarter is for.
01:27:40 I mean, no, you're right,
01:27:41 but I plan on doing like more small Kickstarter.
01:27:43 I just think it makes sense.
01:27:45 And like as long as you deliver successfully,
01:27:47 cause like it, cause the reason it is good
01:27:49 is because you basically can get the,
01:27:52 you basically get paid for it.
01:27:55 Instead of like investing the money to spend,
01:27:58 it might theoretically be cheaper to do it yourself
01:28:00 because you don't have to like pay any Kickstarter fees.
01:28:03 But, you know, aside from that,
01:28:05 it's safer because if you run the Kickstarter,
01:28:07 then people pay for it ahead of time
01:28:09 and you don't assume the risk of like investing in product
01:28:11 that you then must hope will sell.
01:28:13 Right, right.
01:28:14 That's very true.
01:28:15 You know if there's market interest.
01:28:15 Yeah.
01:28:16 Exactly right.
01:28:17 And I don't know, like Mia,
01:28:18 I mean, yeah, that is a big one right there.
01:28:19 And then you have the additional benefit of like,
01:28:21 as opposed to, I mean, I don't know,
01:28:23 I plan on personally like having a Patreon model
01:28:25 going forward for a long time.
01:28:27 And then also when there are specific projects
01:28:29 trying to get people to fund those, you know, in addition,
01:28:32 like me and Digi will eventually do our thing probably
01:28:35 and do like a Kickstarter for like, I don't know,
01:28:37 like some amount of money for some product
01:28:39 on the other side or whatever.
01:28:41 I don't know, just an idea,
01:28:42 but I don't just seems like a good idea.
01:28:44 All right, anyway, that's all done.
01:28:46 So if you didn't get any pins too fucking bad,
01:28:48 you missed your window.
01:28:49 You'll have to wait for,
01:28:50 I think we might do these once in a while,
01:28:53 like maybe six months from now or a year from now,
01:28:56 maybe we'll do this again and we will,
01:28:58 and again, you will be able to,
01:28:59 people will can submit their own vote and like,
01:29:01 but like all the ones that got made this time
01:29:04 will be available to be made next time too,
01:29:06 because the manufacturers will keep the molds.
01:29:08 So we won't have to pay for them to like, yeah.
01:29:11 So we'll be able to order like another hundred
01:29:13 of like an old design at like, you know,
01:29:15 just for the manufacturer costs, which is pretty low.
01:29:18 Yeah, that's sick.
01:29:19 That's sick.
01:29:20 So I think that's the plan.
01:29:21 I think that's, yeah, they're not gonna be available
01:29:23 just to buy any time you want,
01:29:24 but they will be available through like,
01:29:26 future events like this.
01:29:28 Cool.
01:29:29 Well, voice mail time, ladies and gentlemen,
01:29:31 leave, click the link down below
01:29:33 if you wanna leave voice mails at the speak pipe link
01:29:35 and with their good, we'll plan.
01:29:37 So let's get to them.
01:29:39 Oh, this is a public service announcement from beloved,
01:29:43 so this is like of the pre voice mail one.
01:29:45 It's Marinpan, one of our admins
01:29:48 from the PCB Minecraft server.
01:29:50 It's something he wants everybody to know.
01:29:51 Let's hear he has to say, go.
01:29:55 Hey, remember that Pokemon MMORPG game freak
01:29:58 is never gonna make because of their bad idea only policy.
01:30:01 Well, it's been under your nose this whole time.
01:30:04 Pixelmon is a sexy little mod that turns Minecraft
01:30:06 into a fully functional Pokemon game
01:30:08 with mechanics up to date with ultra sun and moon.
01:30:11 And this May 20th, you, that's right you.
01:30:14 Look at me when I'm fucking talking to you.
01:30:16 You have the chance to become the coolest guy.
01:30:20 Come join the procrastinators, Minecraft servers,
01:30:23 first Pokemon championship tournament for your chance
01:30:26 at the highest title in the land,
01:30:28 in video games and in IRL.
01:30:31 For the next few days until the tournament
01:30:33 we'll be disabling the wireless, so you can come in,
01:30:36 build a team and show the world you know about Pokemons
01:30:39 live on Shekels for Hekels.
01:30:42 Stay tuned for monthly free days,
01:30:45 be there or be square.
01:30:50 There you go.
01:30:52 Okay.
01:30:53 I could tell he was trying to think of something else
01:30:54 to say.
01:30:55 So when this episode goes up, it'll be Friday the 15th
01:30:59 and the tournament is on the 20th.
01:31:00 That's right, that's right.
01:31:01 So definitely as of today.
01:31:02 So you will have five days to get into Pixelmon,
01:31:05 the PCB Minecraft server and get a team together.
01:31:09 We will presumably there will be future tournaments
01:31:12 in case five days to do that is kind of a compressed frame.
01:31:16 Well, you know, I talked to MarinPan about that specifically.
01:31:19 So it turns out there is,
01:31:20 I mean, the people who are already in there
01:31:22 have been planning for this for a while.
01:31:23 Yes, that's right.
01:31:24 So just to be clear, on the 20th, on this channel,
01:31:27 the P ProCrastinators podcast,
01:31:29 we are streaming on the Shekels for Hekels,
01:31:31 a Pokemon tournament in the Pokemon,
01:31:33 the PCB Minecraft server.
01:31:35 It's gonna be great.
01:31:36 And yes, the MarinPan, the guys are organizing it.
01:31:38 There will be prizes and all that good stuff.
01:31:40 If you just want to be in the tournament
01:31:43 and just get humiliated,
01:31:44 they just go in there, catch a bunch of shitmonds,
01:31:46 enter the tournament, lose in the first round,
01:31:48 but we will have to acknowledge that.
01:31:50 That's fine.
01:31:50 But even beyond that, there's another thing going on,
01:31:53 which I mean, Ben was getting at,
01:31:54 which is that we are opening up the PCP Minecraft server
01:31:58 for everyone for several days until the tournament.
01:32:01 So we wanna see people just hanging out in the server,
01:32:04 watching the tournament with us.
01:32:06 It's an event we're doing just to get people to come hang out
01:32:09 for a couple of days and shit.
01:32:10 I get it.
01:32:11 Yeah, yeah.
01:32:12 Now I fucking get it.
01:32:14 It's all the pieces are coming together.
01:32:16 So we'll have in the description.
01:32:17 I don't know exactly how it'll work,
01:32:19 but we will have a write-up,
01:32:20 I think MarinPan was putting together one,
01:32:22 of links to everything you need to join the server.
01:32:25 And again, it's gonna be open to everybody
01:32:27 for a span of five or six days or whatever,
01:32:29 so you can come in, you can just spend a few minutes
01:32:31 and look around the world if you want.
01:32:33 You can join the PCP Minecraft server
01:32:36 for free, temporarily.
01:32:38 That's right, for about a week or so.
01:32:39 And after that.
01:32:41 Until the tournament.
01:32:41 And we're thinking of doing future events like this.
01:32:44 How cool would it be?
01:32:45 How cool would it be to have the stands packed?
01:32:47 It would be odd.
01:32:48 With little Minecraft CDs.
01:32:50 Your little Minecraft boy will be visible
01:32:52 on this channel during the stream
01:32:54 as we are watching the tournament live.
01:32:56 You could be in the stadium.
01:32:57 That sounds really fun.
01:32:57 That sounds really cool.
01:32:58 It's a fucking great idea
01:32:59 that MarinPan and Lumia came up with.
01:33:01 I had talked about competing in the tournament,
01:33:04 but even back then I was like,
01:33:06 boy, I feel like I'm so far behind on catching mods,
01:33:09 and now I must be so far behind.
01:33:12 Well, let me tell you,
01:33:12 because I was curious about this too.
01:33:14 So by far the hardest part is catching the Pokemon.
01:33:18 And by the way, there is a write-up,
01:33:20 I'm sure it'll be in the show notes,
01:33:21 about the specific rules for the tournament.
01:33:25 Catching the Pokemon is the hard part,
01:33:27 but leveling them up and EV training them
01:33:29 is actually super easy,
01:33:31 and it takes a little bit of time,
01:33:33 but the old, the horseshoe crew house
01:33:36 that exists in the spawn point,
01:33:38 like Mage set that up when she was admin,
01:33:41 to just make it really easy to grind all your Pokemon
01:33:43 to like level 100 in like a few minutes
01:33:45 against these like level 100 Blizzies.
01:33:47 With the Blizzies, right?
01:33:48 That's right, and EV train them too.
01:33:50 So it's the other stuff that's harder to do,
01:33:52 but actually getting level 100 Pokemon pretty damn easy,
01:33:55 and the boys on the server will tell you all about it
01:33:57 if you want to stop by.
01:33:58 I don't know how to EV train,
01:34:00 but I do, I got all my guys to level 100 with the Blizzies,
01:34:04 but it takes like 10 minutes of Pokemon if it's bad.
01:34:08 So I don't even fucking know how EVs work, frankly.
01:34:10 I don't know how to reset them.
01:34:11 I don't know anything, but I've been told
01:34:13 that it's easy to do.
01:34:13 Oh, if you give them a Thunderstone,
01:34:14 it turns into a Jolteon.
01:34:16 Yes, shit then.
01:34:18 Besinga, indeed my good man.
01:34:22 So there you go.
01:34:22 So I mean, even if you don't want to participate
01:34:24 in the tournament, it would just be really fun
01:34:26 to just be on the stream with us.
01:34:28 On the 20th, which is by the way,
01:34:30 at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, is when we're starting.
01:34:33 Just come hang out and spawn.
01:34:34 Let's have a big fucking party on the server.
01:34:37 You don't have to pay anything to stop by
01:34:39 for the couple of days.
01:34:40 So fuck it, man.
01:34:41 Do what you want.
01:34:42 It's gonna be a good time.
01:34:43 That is pretty hype, I gotta say.
01:34:45 It's gonna be sick, it's gonna be sick.
01:34:48 And our boys, our admins,
01:34:49 have more plans coming in the future.
01:34:51 So hey, do you like Minecraft?
01:34:53 We're, you know, we've been hearing these thoughts
01:34:55 of like, oh, you know, I like Minecraft,
01:34:56 like PCP, blah, blah, blah,
01:34:58 but not to Pixelmon.
01:34:59 We are working on some ideas
01:35:01 to address those concerns as well
01:35:03 in ways that give everybody what they want.
01:35:06 But we'll get back to you on that.
01:35:07 We got, we're cooking up some ideas.
01:35:09 Anyway.
01:35:10 Maybe I'll hop back in the server
01:35:13 so that this week in a fuck around with my team
01:35:16 a little bit.
01:35:17 That's a good idea, that's a good idea.
01:35:18 Everyone's welcome.
01:35:19 We can have, I don't know,
01:35:20 a big old fucking tournament as long as we want.
01:35:22 Okay, onto the next one.
01:35:24 So, okay, here's our first big boy one.
01:35:26 How many more, how many more?
01:35:27 I think we have a total of nine.
01:35:29 Oh, God.
01:35:31 Okay, we'll go through that.
01:35:32 We'll strap in for another hour.
01:35:33 Holy shit.
01:35:34 It will go through him fast.
01:35:36 I promise, guys.
01:35:38 All right, this is a good one.
01:35:39 Here is a Discord at everyone rant.
01:35:42 Go.
01:35:43 Why does everyone get so fucking angry
01:35:47 when you add everyone on Discord?
01:35:49 Like, what the fuck?
01:35:52 It's just a notification.
01:35:53 Why are you so pissed?
01:35:54 I didn't like kill your dog or anything.
01:35:56 Jesus Christ.
01:35:58 Everyone.
01:35:59 I have like never seen anyone where I add everyone.
01:36:01 And then it's like, they're fine with it.
01:36:04 Everyone is fucking mad for some stupid reason.
01:36:07 It's retarded.
01:36:08 It's a notification.
01:36:09 If you don't want it so much, turn it the fuck off.
01:36:15 There you go.
01:36:16 Thoughts, agreement, disagreement, valid.
01:36:19 But also it's valid that everyone's mad.
01:36:21 They're both right.
01:36:23 Yeah, yeah.
01:36:24 I feel like, you say turn it off,
01:36:28 but I don't know why that it always,
01:36:31 like at everyone's always give me notifications anyway.
01:36:34 Even if I mute and like suppress them,
01:36:37 it just doesn't work.
01:36:38 I feel like it just doesn't work too.
01:36:39 Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I don't know.
01:36:42 Like I mute the entire server.
01:36:43 I mute the chat.
01:36:44 I mute every chat just because I don't like notifications
01:36:47 and I check them periodically.
01:36:48 But at everyone's and at here's,
01:36:50 they still, they just seep through.
01:36:52 I don't know how it works.
01:36:53 I feel like I'm missing something.
01:36:55 But hey, I did want to say on a larger point here.
01:36:57 So recently I realized what I should have been doing
01:37:00 all along was I think I saw you doing this Gib.
01:37:03 When I've been streaming, I'm like, oh, you know,
01:37:05 I should just like let people know I'm doing this
01:37:07 in more places than Twitter.
01:37:09 So I've just like added people on like my patron server.
01:37:12 And then also, I think in the PCP one.
01:37:14 And I've got a couple of people being like,
01:37:15 oh, I got two notifications.
01:37:17 I'm seething with rage about that.
01:37:20 And they're not wrong.
01:37:21 I get it.
01:37:22 But I'm wondering how much I should care
01:37:25 that one or two people are mildly annoyed
01:37:27 by an at like that, you know, at that time.
01:37:30 Doesn't matter.
01:37:32 Like the worst that could happen
01:37:35 is that they leave your Discord.
01:37:37 That's true.
01:37:38 Reverse Spectrum, fuck you.
01:37:39 I think it was Reverse Spectrum.
01:37:41 Keep seething, bro.
01:37:42 But like, you know, I posted my Discord at everyone
01:37:46 whenever I have like a...
01:37:49 I mean, I add everyone into the Discord.
01:37:52 I add everyone into the ones that I run.
01:37:54 Yeah, I mean, the PCP one, I was thinking like,
01:37:57 I mean, you know, I know it's not my Discord,
01:37:58 but I figure there's probably people here
01:38:00 who might be interested in seeing it.
01:38:02 So is it, is it a, you know.
01:38:03 It's not a problem when we do it.
01:38:05 It's if you're in someone else's server
01:38:07 and you add everyone, that's when people like do like stop.
01:38:10 Yeah.
01:38:11 Like that's what people get mad about.
01:38:12 That's the run of the mill annoying shit.
01:38:14 I mean, what you should do is you should just go
01:38:16 into your server settings and disable
01:38:18 at everyone function for anyone but you.
01:38:21 Before the Iowa caucuses and before Super Tuesday,
01:38:24 I went into like a bunch of different servers
01:38:25 and I didn't care.
01:38:27 I just added everyone.
01:38:28 I was like, remember to vote.
01:38:28 Remember to vote for Bernie Sanders.
01:38:30 Right, of course.
01:38:31 I knew I would get banned.
01:38:33 I didn't care.
01:38:34 Did you get banned?
01:38:35 I only got banned from one server.
01:38:38 And I don't even think I got banned.
01:38:39 I just got kicked.
01:38:40 Was it the Ted Cruz fan server?
01:38:42 It was in a server that I absolutely did not care
01:38:46 about being in at all.
01:38:47 It was from the Amy T Falcone fan server.
01:38:51 Do you know who that is?
01:38:52 No, I'm gonna Google it though.
01:38:53 She was one of the contestants on strip search
01:38:56 and she is a Penny Arcade.
01:38:59 She's a Penny Arcade orbiter now
01:39:01 and now she's on the Acquisitions Incorporated C team.
01:39:04 Well, that's cool.
01:39:06 Oh yeah, I remember.
01:39:06 It was fine.
01:39:07 But yeah, that was the only server I got banned from
01:39:10 for relentlessly adding everyone
01:39:11 telling them to vote for Bernie Sanders.
01:39:13 Ben, please have mercy on them.
01:39:15 They can only handle so much.
01:39:16 Well, they fucking, they executed me.
01:39:19 Well, fair enough, fair enough.
01:39:21 It's out of my hands now.
01:39:22 Amy Falcone fan server, just where I would wanna be.
01:39:25 All right, well, all right, there it is.
01:39:26 There's your info on that.
01:39:28 All right, next one.
01:39:29 This is a voicemail god, PCPPSA.
01:39:33 Okay, I forget what this was.
01:39:34 Let's find out.
01:39:38 Yeah, I play Final Fantasy VII.
01:39:41 I like using, you know, the spells,
01:39:43 such as fire one, fire two, and fire three.
01:39:49 Oh yeah, that's right.
01:39:51 Okay, I'll play this game.
01:39:52 What the fuck is this spells?
01:39:57 What?
01:39:58 They spelled fire wrong.
01:40:07 Kingdom Hearts is a bad video game.
01:40:12 That's it.
01:40:13 Go watch my live streams and watch the VODs.
01:40:16 I have, all right.
01:40:17 You still haven't beat Clary yet?
01:40:19 I'm right there.
01:40:20 I'm just training for her right now.
01:40:22 We're making a plan.
01:40:23 I have never watched a BGE Nuzlocke
01:40:27 and I feel like it's mostly because
01:40:29 of a large time investment.
01:40:31 Like how many episodes is that?
01:40:33 How many hours of my time is that?
01:40:35 You should watch, it's called Value for Money.
01:40:38 That's totally understandable.
01:40:40 I don't blame anybody who doesn't like,
01:40:41 who isn't like doing a task.
01:40:42 Zero money and how many countless hours of content.
01:40:45 How many people have watched like my eight,
01:40:47 my six hour Ratchet and Clank two stream?
01:40:50 It's a lot of value for no money.
01:40:53 And it was fun, but like,
01:40:55 I don't expect any of you to watch that.
01:40:57 Well, sure, sure.
01:40:58 How many people have watched the legend
01:41:00 the entirety of the Rowdyfuckers cop killers,
01:41:02 Pokemon, XD, Gale of Darkness things?
01:41:04 I think not all of those.
01:41:05 It's billions, not all of those.
01:41:06 Billions.
01:41:07 With a B.
01:41:08 It's just a matter of like putting in the tedious work
01:41:11 of like cutting it down to highlights.
01:41:14 True, true.
01:41:16 But what you know, for my first Nuzlocke,
01:41:18 no Needra did that, I believe.
01:41:20 I think he's the one who made a full,
01:41:22 like the entire Nuzlocke for Diamond up to,
01:41:25 like he made it like in a couple days before the Elite Four.
01:41:29 And he really killed it with that.
01:41:30 It was fucking sick.
01:41:32 Yeah, I think I may have looked at that.
01:41:34 I don't know, what was it?
01:41:35 Like, how long was that?
01:41:37 It was probably still like 20 minute video highlights.
01:41:39 Yeah, yeah.
01:41:40 I mean, a lot of fun stuff does happen.
01:41:42 So I think that was a pretty great video personally.
01:41:44 I mean, it like condenses like the,
01:41:47 I had to grind friendship.
01:41:49 So there were like several episodes
01:41:51 of me just walking back and forth
01:41:53 while we just talked about whatever on the stream.
01:41:56 See, that's kind of more of what I would like
01:41:59 is like the stories you can tell,
01:42:01 like D&D-esque stories of you doing strange,
01:42:04 funny things on your Nuzlocke,
01:42:06 rather than watching like a really long video highlighting it.
01:42:09 Yeah, I mean, yeah.
01:42:10 Like a lecture.
01:42:11 Someone do a lecture on the fucking Nuzlocke.
01:42:15 Like the grinding story I've heard you tell before.
01:42:18 And I was like, yeah, like I can appreciate the,
01:42:21 I can get the gist of why that's cool
01:42:23 without having to experience all of it.
01:42:25 Yeah, yeah.
01:42:26 Oh my God, I was playing Pokemon Flip,
01:42:28 or sorry, the Voltorb Flip in the gold,
01:42:32 what is it like, the Goldenrod Casino yesterday.
01:42:35 And when I realized that like, when you went around,
01:42:38 I had to get 14,000 like Pokécoins or whatever it is in there
01:42:43 in order to buy the TMs I needed of Swords Dance
01:42:45 for Heracross and Thunderbolt for my based electrode,
01:42:50 Lubshorne.
01:42:51 And so I could one-shot that fucking Gyarados piece of shit
01:42:55 with the electrode.
01:42:56 After using a light screen turn one, baby.
01:42:59 Fuckin', I, when I was realizing
01:43:02 how ineffectual and pathetic I was at that game
01:43:05 and how if you make a mistake,
01:43:08 you can be kicked down from like the higher level
01:43:10 of fighting tiers all the way back down to level one.
01:43:13 It was then my third eye open, I realized,
01:43:15 wait, I'll just use save states and cheat.
01:43:18 It's the greatest idea I've ever had.
01:43:20 And then I did it and it was great
01:43:22 because you can't even lose money.
01:43:23 You can only lose time in that game
01:43:26 because there's no monetary investment.
01:43:28 The house literally cannot win.
01:43:30 You can only lose.
01:43:32 So I allowed myself to do it.
01:43:33 That's a funny story in context,
01:43:36 but it's not that funny to watch for like three hours
01:43:39 of me grinding it to have that realization later.
01:43:41 I mean, I don't know, me and the people,
01:43:43 we talk about fun stuff while we're doing it or whatever,
01:43:46 gushing about rage and seething about the remade,
01:43:49 et cetera, et cetera.
01:43:50 Every now and, you know, that's,
01:43:52 it's been like a highlight reel,
01:43:53 like the YouTube nuzzle locks,
01:43:55 like my nuzzle locks are basically,
01:43:56 they're basically a highlight reel.
01:43:58 But like, there was no original or there was.
01:44:02 I only talk during certain parts.
01:44:04 But I still get comments.
01:44:06 Every now and then, a little YouTube notification
01:44:08 with someone that's like, dude, I watched this again.
01:44:12 Like I watched this back in the day,
01:44:14 please do another one.
01:44:15 And I'm like, I want another Ben nuzzle lock too.
01:44:18 I mean.
01:44:19 I know.
01:44:20 Have I already said what I'm thinking?
01:44:20 Yeah, you said of a, not Yo-Kai watch,
01:44:23 but the other one, the Temtem.
01:44:24 I was considering, and I don't know if it's a good idea yet.
01:44:27 I have to look into it,
01:44:28 but I was considering that maybe
01:44:30 when I get back to streaming, whenever that is,
01:44:32 whenever I'm ready to do that,
01:44:34 I will start a new nuzzle lock
01:44:36 and it would be a Temtem nuzzle lock.
01:44:39 And then I would probably cut it down
01:44:41 and make like a highlight YouTube show.
01:44:44 I think probably.
01:44:44 As the number one fan of your nuzzle locks,
01:44:47 I want that to exist.
01:44:49 The only, I don't know how nuzzle lockable Temtem is.
01:44:53 Like it seems like it is, but it seems like it's,
01:44:56 I don't know.
01:44:57 You might need to really say how it looks.
01:44:58 I was making Temtem.
01:44:58 I would absolutely make sure it's compliant with nuzzle locks.
01:45:01 I think there is like a nuzzle lock mode.
01:45:04 Oh, well that'd be sick.
01:45:05 Or maybe it's like,
01:45:06 oh, well that'd be sick.
01:45:07 Or maybe there might actually just be a nuzzle lock mode.
01:45:12 That would sure take the fucking pain out of me.
01:45:13 But you know, Pokemon Uranium had a nuzzle lock mode
01:45:16 and it made me really mad because there was a, okay.
01:45:22 It seems one of the rules that it imposed on you
01:45:26 was that it would not let you catch duplicates, right?
01:45:29 But it did not count different Pokemon
01:45:31 from the same evolutionary line as duplicates.
01:45:35 So if you had a tentacruel,
01:45:37 if you had a tentacool and you found a wild tentacool
01:45:41 and you didn't catch it, right?
01:45:43 It would consider that to be the one you're allowed to catch.
01:45:46 And it would be like, no, you can't catch anymore.
01:45:48 Like that was your chance.
01:45:49 Even though obviously, obviously the spirit
01:45:52 of the dupes clause is that, no, that would be a dupe.
01:45:55 Like that's effectively a duplicate.
01:45:57 Fuck you, okay?
01:45:58 Yeah, that sucks.
01:45:59 That the Uranium nuzzle lock mode
01:46:02 had that one glaring flaw that made me so mad.
01:46:04 And that might be why I didn't end up playing that game.
01:46:07 Lamar.
01:46:08 Fair enough, fair enough.
01:46:09 But, you know, maybe I could go back and do that.
01:46:13 Maybe we could go back and do that for like RFCK
01:46:16 because it's like toxic waste mutation.
01:46:17 Yeah, that sounds awesome.
01:46:19 Ooh, my brain.
01:46:21 I mean, that would be a long-term commitment
01:46:24 doing a full nuzzle lock one of those.
01:46:25 But I mean, I would love it.
01:46:26 Oh dude, it'll be just like Pokemon XT Gale of Darkness.
01:46:28 It'll be the greatest time ever.
01:46:29 No, it's such a great game.
01:46:30 No, no, no.
01:46:31 It won't be miserable at all.
01:46:32 It won't be the worst thing you ever,
01:46:33 just for like a year of your entire fucking life.
01:46:35 Do it.
01:46:36 I love nuzzle locks.
01:46:37 I would watch that.
01:46:37 I want to see that.
01:46:38 Oh, oh my God.
01:46:40 That's a great idea.
01:46:41 That's a great idea.
01:46:43 Briefly on the subject of highlights,
01:46:45 I really feel like I might at one time
01:46:49 want to go back to my given gaming streams
01:46:52 and like sift through them to find like the good moments
01:46:55 because there are a lot of like really, really funny
01:46:58 like Game Grumps-esque like laughing moments.
01:47:01 But they're so buried.
01:47:02 Like nobody knows about it.
01:47:03 You need like an editor, man.
01:47:04 Like me and three other people.
01:47:04 Someone who catalogs this shit to do that kind of stuff.
01:47:06 The day is getting closer all the time.
01:47:09 It is approaching.
01:47:10 When I can, when I have,
01:47:11 when I will have enough like saved up inventory
01:47:16 of Let's Plays and highlights to relaunch,
01:47:20 it's a blue glow channel.
01:47:21 And that day will be glorious.
01:47:23 There will be some, just a never ending stream.
01:47:26 It'll be like you've entered the land of milk and honey.
01:47:29 You found the promised land of funny Let's Plays
01:47:33 where Mako energy flows from the ground.
01:47:36 It's just gonna be, I think about all the time.
01:47:39 I fantasize about this far off day in the future
01:47:42 and it gets closer every day.
01:47:43 Cause every day I accumulate more footage
01:47:46 and I sit here and I tediously make my little highlight reels
01:47:50 and I make the thumbnails.
01:47:52 The other day I sat here for fucking three hours
01:47:54 making thumbnails for all these like backed up clips
01:47:58 of footage and I'm just, I'm like a mad man.
01:48:00 I'm just sitting here plotting the day
01:48:02 when I can be like, Hey, everybody, guess what?
01:48:04 There's a schedule now.
01:48:05 There's gonna be a funny Let's Play
01:48:07 every day for the rest of your fucking lives.
01:48:08 And they'll be like, Oh my God, we love this guy.
01:48:10 And I'll be like, yes, money, all the beautiful money
01:48:13 for all the entertainment for you
01:48:15 and all the money for me.
01:48:17 I want that man.
01:48:18 I'm waiting for it.
01:48:19 Hey, Jesse, where is, where is the like the,
01:48:23 the Dark Souls thing that I was,
01:48:26 Oh, Poise Boys.
01:48:27 Like you were playing a Poise Boy
01:48:29 and then S.H.I.E.L.D. O'Neill, my character.
01:48:34 Me and Gibbon did like a multiplayer Dark Souls run together
01:48:39 where the, where the conceit was we would try to,
01:48:41 we would both make characters specifically maxed out
01:48:44 in Poise just to kind of explore this forgotten stat
01:48:47 in the series and it was called Poise Boys.
01:48:50 And my character was called Tank McSpank
01:48:52 and his character was called S.H.I.E.L.D. O'Neill
01:48:54 and it was awesome and I have all the footage
01:48:56 and I was looking for it the other day
01:48:59 and I couldn't find it.
01:49:00 And like I had this moment of like, oh my God,
01:49:02 did I delete the Poise Boys footage at some point
01:49:05 to like save on space?
01:49:07 Oh no, I can't find it anywhere.
01:49:09 I must have deleted it.
01:49:10 What a fool.
01:49:10 I could have, I could have finally used it.
01:49:12 What a foolish, foolish man I am.
01:49:14 But then miraculously I was going through
01:49:17 like the, my little dashboard page on YouTube for the channel
01:49:21 and like turns out I did delete them for space.
01:49:24 But first I made sure to upload the raw footage
01:49:26 as private videos so I still have it.
01:49:28 I still have the Poise Boys footage.
01:49:30 Thank God.
01:49:31 It will be seen someday come hell or high water.
01:49:33 Hmm, hmm.
01:49:35 Excellent.
01:49:36 Hell yeah.
01:49:37 All right, let's move on to our next voicemail.
01:49:39 We got plenty more to get through.
01:49:41 All right, so this one is Shaggy
01:49:43 gives us the good news by Jelly Beaner.
01:49:46 All right, take it away.
01:49:48 Little brothers and sisters today.
01:49:52 You'll be listening to a PCP passage
01:49:56 from the patron saint of wrestling, Jesse.
01:50:01 Please turn to chapter 69, page 420 man
01:50:06 in your PCP branded Bibles.
01:50:10 Let's hear the wise words of Jesse.
01:50:13 Fucking Jews, mutilating our babies
01:50:16 and selling their balls in a cold bag
01:50:17 next to the ice cream.
01:50:19 I hate Jews.
01:50:21 Here, Jesse is clearly telling us
01:50:24 exclamation point dab on the Jews.
01:50:29 Now, where are those who pose the dabbing of Jews?
01:50:34 They're like Jews in sheep's clothing, man.
01:50:39 To them, I say exclamation point dab.
01:50:45 Will the congregation please stand
01:50:48 in all dabbing unison on the Jews?
01:50:52 I'm up, I'm up.
01:50:53 Everyone stand up.
01:50:54 I'm standing. Absolutely.
01:50:56 That is so fucking weird.
01:50:57 That clip is- What's that from?
01:51:00 I can't remember.
01:51:00 Why did it end?
01:51:01 That's it, that's the end of the sermon.
01:51:03 I know, it's sad, I know, I know.
01:51:05 Dab, isn't that from like fuck cars or something?
01:51:06 It's from fuck pizza.
01:51:08 And like- You're right.
01:51:10 It's like someone just asked me about it the other day.
01:51:13 Someone like messaged me like, where's fuck pizza?
01:51:15 What did you delete fuck pizza?
01:51:17 Like I didn't delete fuck pizza.
01:51:20 It got fucking taken down for hate speech
01:51:23 because of that Jew joke.
01:51:24 Right, right.
01:51:25 And it's like, you know, and like obviously,
01:51:28 I don't remember the context, but the video's about pizza.
01:51:31 I was fucking, you know.
01:51:35 I think I remember, like you said something like
01:51:37 how we cost at some point.
01:51:38 That's right, that's right.
01:51:39 Yeah, the punchline was how we cost.
01:51:41 Cause that's why I was talking about,
01:51:43 I was talking about how oven pizza is not real pizza.
01:51:47 And it's not, it doesn't taste good.
01:51:49 DeGiorno sucks, the commercials are lies.
01:51:52 The oven sucks and from the oven became, you know,
01:51:55 and became like a Jew joke.
01:51:57 And because the Jew joke then went into the punchline,
01:52:01 which was the fucking how we cost as in hungry howies.
01:52:05 It was not, it was a fucking pizza joke.
01:52:08 And they took down the video for hate speech.
01:52:10 I mean, you know, obviously retarded,
01:52:12 but I don't know, yeah, what can you do?
01:52:14 That's YouTube for you.
01:52:15 That's YouTube.
01:52:16 Michelle got her Twitter taken down for,
01:52:19 it was like a black guy pointing a gun at the screen
01:52:22 and it was something about like a begun thought
01:52:24 is was like her text and like that was considered
01:52:26 like a violent threat or something,
01:52:28 which I mean, it was a man with a gun.
01:52:30 Okay, sure.
01:52:31 But you know, it was a joke.
01:52:34 You just can't, you know, when you're in charge,
01:52:36 you just can't-
01:52:37 No, it was big, it was big champ.
01:52:38 It was big champ.
01:52:39 Oh, that's right, yeah.
01:52:40 A silent thing.
01:52:41 Big champ is onto Michelle trying to, you know,
01:52:42 subvert their-
01:52:43 They wanted her oil.
01:52:44 God.
01:52:45 She was getting the word.
01:52:47 I'm mad thinking about it.
01:52:48 I'm mad all over again.
01:52:49 How he cost is like the best joke I've ever fucking written.
01:52:53 They took it from me.
01:52:55 What can you do, man?
01:52:56 Hey, let's move on to, what do we got here?
01:52:59 Blasphemous Nats, Gold Dig Grotto.
01:53:03 Jesse saves the PCP?
01:53:05 Okay, apparently I think that's the full title.
01:53:06 All right, let's take it away, go.
01:53:09 Hey boy, what you doing down by the river?
01:53:12 I'm searching for gold, mister.
01:53:14 We ain't gonna find none.
01:53:15 Ain't much of nothing around here no more.
01:53:17 Why is that, mister?
01:53:19 Well, once in the topics done dried up,
01:53:21 well, saying the horse cock nostalgia
01:53:22 is the only glue keeping them together
01:53:24 is it's putting it nicely.
01:53:26 Chatsky's gone and unshatsky.
01:53:27 If the brothers make one more
01:53:29 unfact check political statement,
01:53:30 the dam's gonna burst.
01:53:32 Mages dead, digital brother up
01:53:34 and went on some kind of grid-based system of rule.
01:53:37 All of ours are furry
01:53:38 and hippos selling nudie mags of his juice starter.
01:53:41 Say, ain't you seen the wanted posters?
01:53:43 No, mister.
01:53:44 Well, then PCB boys trying to skip town
01:53:47 with that their OVA money.
01:53:49 Sheriff, big news on the front.
01:53:51 We found the boys camped out near the kick starters.
01:53:54 Shit, let's go.
01:53:57 All right, PCB boys, here's the fact.
01:54:01 We enjoy careers now
01:54:03 while you still got a little something left in ya.
01:54:05 Hey, hey, god!
01:54:06 Sir, I don't think they'll listen to no reason.
01:54:09 Damn it, we're going in.
01:54:10 Ah!
01:54:16 They got me good.
01:54:18 Oh, no, mister.
01:54:19 Boy, look at me real.
01:54:21 Get the fuck out of here.
01:54:23 Them PCB boys might be high and dry,
01:54:25 but like the whiskey from my pappy stash,
01:54:27 they'll still give you that good kick when you meet me.
01:54:30 Don't let them hook ya.
01:54:32 Bad Con 5 isn't real, it's not coming.
01:54:34 She sure fits the ass one.
01:54:36 He's back!
01:54:41 That's it.
01:54:42 That's the end.
01:54:44 I feel so comfortable with the whistle.
01:54:46 How did Jesse save us?
01:54:47 I don't understand.
01:54:48 That was fucking amazing.
01:54:49 I mean, that was nuts.
01:54:51 I mean, the density of memory going on.
01:54:53 Voice grail.
01:54:54 Voice grail, I think Blasphemous Nat.
01:54:56 Well, just put, yeah, I mean, I'm at, yeah, fuck it.
01:54:58 Oh, that was Nat Blasphemous?
01:55:00 Blasphemous Nat, Nat Blasphemous.
01:55:02 I'll put Nat Blasphemous in there.
01:55:04 Well, I mean, I'm going to nominate it for Voice Grail
01:55:08 to basically, like, as like a smoke screen
01:55:11 against what it's saying is absolutely true,
01:55:13 we are running away with the Ovi money.
01:55:16 Radcon 5 is all a smoke screen.
01:55:19 We are moving to South America.
01:55:20 There is no more content coming.
01:55:22 This is the end.
01:55:23 We will one day up and disappear into the wild west
01:55:27 and right into the sunset.
01:55:29 Oh, God, I just had a great idea.
01:55:30 That whistle.
01:55:31 That whistle was nuts.
01:55:32 The little bit was the bomb.
01:55:35 This is actually maybe too good an idea,
01:55:37 and I shouldn't say it here because we might use it.
01:55:39 Sensor this, Eleazar, please.
01:55:41 But what if we...
01:55:43 Yeah, never mind.
01:55:43 Okay, good idea.
01:55:46 Okay, on to the next one.
01:55:47 That reminds me, go to onlyfans.com slash pump911.
01:55:51 Oh, Christ.
01:55:52 There's a whole new image on there.
01:55:55 I'm going to take that voice.
01:55:55 Every time I talk about it, I get a new person.
01:55:58 It's free money.
01:55:59 Yeah, I'm saying that voicemail is in Voice Grail now.
01:56:05 I'm going to canonize it in order to disguise its message,
01:56:09 in order to recuperate its messaging,
01:56:12 in the same way that Labor Day is about
01:56:17 socialist protesters getting murdered by the cops,
01:56:19 but it's okay.
01:56:20 We made Labor Day a national holiday,
01:56:22 so now it's actually about working hard.
01:56:24 The government condones this, right?
01:56:25 We've recuperated the messaging.
01:56:27 That's what we're doing.
01:56:29 Don't worry about the man behind the curtain.
01:56:31 I'm also putting it in here so that he'll...
01:56:34 Was that really the end of the story?
01:56:35 I didn't quite understand.
01:56:35 Did Jesse save the PCP?
01:56:37 Did he?
01:56:38 Is he the one who chased off the...
01:56:40 I think he was coming back to finish the job.
01:56:42 Oh, okay.
01:56:44 I was dreading that it would just be another out-of-context Jew joke.
01:56:49 We would then be inundated by dozens of the same fucking...
01:56:53 Like some mad man out there is just flooding our inbox
01:56:57 with us saying bad things about people by accident.
01:57:03 I love a good out-of-context clip.
01:57:06 It's my favorite.
01:57:07 All right, next voicemail is...
01:57:10 Don't do that.
01:57:12 Let me see.
01:57:12 Ranting Raoul, perpetually blue-balled.
01:57:16 Okay, thanks, Raoul.
01:57:17 Go.
01:57:18 What are you guys' thoughts on Patreon and Sentence
01:57:20 stuck in with the development cycle of video games?
01:57:22 Like, I'm tired of seeing these shitty porn games
01:57:24 perpetually stuck in early alpha
01:57:26 because every fucker feels the need to cram their niche fetish into the game.
01:57:30 To me, it just comes off as people giving up
01:57:32 the integrity of the art just for a quick butt.
01:57:34 Maybe it's a cynical take on games development,
01:57:36 but god damn it, I just want a good set.
01:57:39 Well, I see.
01:57:40 He's getting blue-balled by these porn games not releasing
01:57:43 because they're in development hell.
01:57:45 I mean, games being in development hell in general is cringe.
01:57:50 And stupid.
01:57:53 And a big problem with the crowdfunding model, for sure.
01:57:55 These porn games have no incentive to be finished.
01:57:58 The longer the development takes, the more money they make.
01:58:00 I can't blame, you know, somebody wants to do it, whatever.
01:58:02 I get it.
01:58:03 But like, a better model, I think, for a game,
01:58:05 I mean, it depends on the size and scale of the project, obviously.
01:58:08 But it seems to me that Kickstarter is a way, like,
01:58:10 more manageable thing for, like, for the investor, for, like, the...
01:58:14 Well, I mean, the danger of that is that
01:58:16 you might get the funding you asked for,
01:58:19 and then you might discover that you didn't ask for enough
01:58:22 and you can't finish the project and you can't deliver on it.
01:58:25 Like what happened with Charles Barkley, too.
01:58:29 That's true.
01:58:29 I mean, I'd like to think that they could,
01:58:32 if in a situation like that, maybe,
01:58:35 I mean, maybe it's overly optimistic,
01:58:36 but you could just be honest with your audience and say,
01:58:38 like, guys, we realized that this was beyond what we thought,
01:58:41 so we're going to, like, open a second round of funding to do this,
01:58:44 and maybe we'll offer some additional benefits.
01:58:47 Yeah, I mean, that is the danger, too, I guess.
01:58:49 Neither is perfect.
01:58:51 But I mean, I would never fucking...
01:58:54 I would never fucking a Patreon, a porn game, dev, so...
01:59:00 Yeah, I would never pay for porn, but, you know,
01:59:03 I could theoretically see myself supporting,
01:59:05 probably via Kickstarter, a game that I thought was amazing,
01:59:08 even, you know, I like porn games, so maybe that would happen.
01:59:11 But a Patreon model, I...
01:59:13 There's so many bad incentives with the Patreon model.
01:59:16 You know, look at your boy, Yandere Dev, it's, you know...
01:59:19 Yeah.
01:59:20 There's some issues with that timeline.
01:59:22 You know...
01:59:23 Never pay for anything.
01:59:25 If something was, like, very much in my wheelhouse,
01:59:29 and I was like, this is exactly what I want.
01:59:31 I might buy it, like, I might buy it,
01:59:35 but I don't think I would...
01:59:36 I can't see myself crowdfunding, like, a porn,
01:59:40 like a porn game or something, because, yeah,
01:59:42 because this is what happens, they end up in...
01:59:44 I don't...
01:59:45 The only time you should spend money on porn
01:59:48 is a commission of, like, you getting...
01:59:51 A very specific thing.
01:59:52 Like, a very specific new, like, you know,
01:59:56 the exact character you want in the exact way
01:59:57 that they can do it, that otherwise would not exist.
02:00:02 Yeah.
02:00:03 If you really care about that sort of thing,
02:00:04 I've always thought that, like, I mean,
02:00:06 once you get that post-nut clarity, I mean,
02:00:09 I often find, like, I've never spent money on porn,
02:00:12 but I regret the time that I invested.
02:00:14 I'm like, why was I concerned?
02:00:16 I should have just rushed to the nut,
02:00:17 and then I'd be free to go about my day doing other things.
02:00:20 So I've always thought that it's not a particularly valuable
02:00:24 commodity when...
02:00:25 I don't know.
02:00:26 I mean, I've never done it,
02:00:28 but, like, I guess I get the idea.
02:00:31 Like, if it's fine, I don't think it's down or anything.
02:00:33 Yeah, whatever.
02:00:33 If you want to do it, that's fine.
02:00:35 But, yeah, I mean, I would always...
02:00:37 The only times I've backed a campaign,
02:00:39 I've literally backed two.
02:00:41 Yours, Ben, for Vapors 2 or whatever,
02:00:44 and this new one for the RFCK pins,
02:00:46 because they're the only way I can get those things that I want.
02:00:49 Those?
02:00:50 Those are very small.
02:00:52 Those are small, like, achievable projects.
02:00:55 They are to be done within a specific, you know, frame,
02:00:59 speaking of which, still waiting on the last four,
02:01:03 but they keep telling me they're almost done.
02:01:05 My guest artists...
02:01:06 We thought dates are gonna open.
02:01:09 Jade and Nexus have both told me,
02:01:12 reassured me, again, of late,
02:01:14 that their guest vaperettes are nearing completion.
02:01:17 Okay.
02:01:18 I'm sure.
02:01:20 I believe that Munchie and Kazi will not be far behind with theirs.
02:01:23 I have faith.
02:01:25 Shane, maybe spend a little less time
02:01:26 on the Animal Crossing Munchie and Kazi
02:01:28 and a little bit more on finishing the vaperettes.
02:01:31 Yeah, maybe get off of Snack Time Island,
02:01:34 you fucking degenerates.
02:01:36 Log back into reality once in a while,
02:01:38 why don't ya, and wake up to your responsibility.
02:01:41 Maybe if you looked up from your fucking smartphones.
02:01:45 From your damn Pokemon Go machine.
02:01:47 I fucking finished mine in 2019.
02:01:50 Yeah, I've had yours and Cheesy Manfredo's
02:01:53 for a fucking eternity.
02:01:57 I'm sure they'll be worth the wait.
02:01:58 I'm sure they'll be worth the wait.
02:02:00 Well, it'll be pretty good, and I'm pretty sure,
02:02:02 I'm pretty sure that at this point,
02:02:04 probably there are people who have pledged to it
02:02:06 and have just forgotten about it,
02:02:08 and those people have already given up
02:02:11 and probably have no expectations
02:02:12 and will probably be floored and stunned
02:02:14 and their jaw will be...
02:02:16 Those socks will be rocked
02:02:18 when they receive a package in the mail from yours truly.
02:02:21 Ben, we call that the Ghost in the Shell Best Anime Ever Model.
02:02:25 That's the way to go.
02:02:31 Yeah.
02:02:31 Keep them waiting so long it feels like a gift.
02:02:36 It feels like there was never any hope or expectation.
02:02:39 All right, next voicemail.
02:02:40 How many more?
02:02:41 Please end it.
02:02:42 There's a total of four, and we can go quick.
02:02:44 Christ.
02:02:45 Zach C.G., I believe is the name.
02:02:47 Okay, Zach, go.
02:02:49 Did you, bro?
02:02:49 Did you, bro?
02:02:50 Where is rode the rack on four?
02:02:52 Chapter five.
02:02:54 You said that we'd get a fifth.
02:02:56 Chapter, you know I'm not satisfied.
02:02:59 Did you, bro?
02:03:00 Did you, bro?
02:03:01 Where is rode the rack on four?
02:03:03 Chapter five.
02:03:05 You said that we'd get a fifth.
02:03:07 Chapter, you know I'm not satisfied.
02:03:10 Oh!
02:03:10 Did you, bro?
02:03:11 Did you, bro?
02:03:12 Give me that!
02:03:13 Ride the rack on four!
02:03:14 Chapter five, motherfucker!
02:03:16 Chapter five.
02:03:19 Yeah, you're right.
02:03:20 Well, look, clearly nobody has time to be both an author and a psychologist, so he had to pick a lane.
02:03:28 God, no, we need that constant.
02:03:30 I don't know if I could say he chose wisely, but he chose.
02:03:33 We need that content so that we can get, so we can have, I think it ties into the,
02:03:39 the, the, the, not the OVA.
02:03:42 All the Brad stuff, the lecture.
02:03:44 No, no, no, this is the other fucking stretch goal we did.
02:03:48 Music.
02:03:48 The dojin, the dojin.
02:03:49 Oh, yeah, the dojin.
02:03:50 I, I think it might tie into the dojin.
02:03:54 Maybe?
02:03:54 That's maybe, I mean, it certainly could.
02:03:57 Maybe.
02:03:58 Okay, whatever.
02:03:58 Whatever, I don't know.
02:03:59 Still all very ambiguous.
02:04:01 We must have the dramatic conclusion.
02:04:04 Yep, yep, we need to know.
02:04:05 Did they get to radcon four?
02:04:07 Did radcon four happen?
02:04:08 We'll just never know.
02:04:09 I don't even know.
02:04:10 We'll just never know.
02:04:11 I don't know.
02:04:12 Feels like it never happened.
02:04:14 All right.
02:04:14 You've been shamed, Iggy.
02:04:15 Next one is, oh, okay.
02:04:18 This is Final Fantasy VII Spells Such As.
02:04:23 All right, sounds good.
02:04:24 Let's go.
02:04:26 This is a PCP PSA.
02:04:29 I have an announcement for you all.
02:04:31 I think, in my opinion, now is the time to get into BGE's Nuzla.
02:04:38 Hmm, yes.
02:04:39 He is hitting a point now where he is going to be grinding for a while
02:04:44 for the final gym in HeartGold.
02:04:48 I recommend catching up on all the episodes
02:04:51 uploaded to his livestream channel and trust me, his rival,
02:04:57 that they are all very action-packed.
02:04:59 VMG, sign it out.
02:05:02 You know, I forgot about this, but it's true.
02:05:04 Final Fantasy VII originally just called him like Fire 1, 2, and 3.
02:05:07 I could really forgot.
02:05:08 Really?
02:05:08 And this reminded me.
02:05:09 Yeah, yeah.
02:05:10 Wasn't it like a Fire Raga and Fire Rurara?
02:05:14 Wasn't that already in other Final Fantasy games?
02:05:18 Well, it was in.
02:05:19 I know it was in eight onward.
02:05:21 I thought it was in seven.
02:05:22 You know, going back, in Final Fantasy, the only Final Fantasy games that came to the west
02:05:28 were Final Fantasy I, I, IV, and VI, and I'm pretty, you know what?
02:05:35 I really don't know historically if when Final Fantasy VII came out,
02:05:38 they had adopted the like, like for the Fire, it's Fire, Fira, and Fire Raga are like the
02:05:43 three main ones.
02:05:44 I don't believe this.
02:05:45 I think this is false.
02:05:48 Dude, I checked it.
02:05:48 I checked it out.
02:05:49 FF7 had the one.
02:05:51 I did not remember that it was the numbers, but yeah, they do it.
02:05:54 No.
02:05:55 I'm about to replay it.
02:05:56 You're lying to me.
02:05:57 I shall confirm.
02:05:59 Oh, I'm going to play the PC one.
02:06:00 I wonder if it maintains.
02:06:01 Well, geez, I fucking googled Final Fantasy VII Materia, and why don't I have the answer yet?
02:06:07 Because of the remake, Ben, that's why.
02:06:09 Because the remake's clouding our cultural consciousness with this deluded,
02:06:13 next voicemail, next voicemail.
02:06:15 All right.
02:06:16 Okay.
02:06:16 Fair point.
02:06:18 Oh, okay.
02:06:19 We've got 15-year-old Sam and any, any success there, Ben?
02:06:23 Here, I'll look at.
02:06:24 No, I found, I found something that said Fire, Fira, Fira Raga, but no, but no,
02:06:28 it's about the remake.
02:06:29 It's about the fucking remake.
02:06:30 I don't want to know about the remake.
02:06:32 Die.
02:06:32 I'll find it.
02:06:33 All right, Sam, take it away.
02:06:34 Go.
02:06:35 Hey, PCP, long-time listener, first-time caller.
02:06:38 I'm an A-head.
02:06:39 That's besides the point.
02:06:40 So now it's May 9th, and I started the One Punch Man Regiment May 1st.
02:06:45 But by this time, I've doubled what I've usually been doing.
02:06:50 And so what I want to say is progress is the best feeling a human can feel.
02:06:58 It's not the results.
02:06:59 It's the knowing that you are getting better.
02:07:02 Thoughts and opinions?
02:07:05 Wait, what?
02:07:07 He just said that progress is the best feeling.
02:07:08 It's about the journey, not the destination.
02:07:10 That's the meme.
02:07:11 What's about the journey?
02:07:13 Is this about just life advice?
02:07:15 He was doing the One Punch Man Fitness routine for the last week or two,
02:07:18 and we were saying it feels great.
02:07:21 Yeah, if you imagine yourself as you are now, like, yeah, I feel all right.
02:07:26 But imagine if you were way worse off, you know?
02:07:30 Then it would be like, gosh, getting closer to this would be like,
02:07:34 like, you don't feel constant elation that you are currently the way you are.
02:07:39 It is always the feeling of getting better that gets you going.
02:07:42 Right.
02:07:42 It's about achieving that purpose.
02:07:44 It's why purpose is better than happiness.
02:07:47 Well, I mean, I certainly agree.
02:07:48 But I think that happiness is a state of mind that is achieved sporadically
02:07:55 through having lots of positive things in your life,
02:07:59 one of them being purpose, and another one being, I don't know,
02:08:02 whatever, health and things like that.
02:08:04 I don't know.
02:08:05 By the way, Ben, I did pull up.
02:08:07 I just went to the wiki real quick.
02:08:09 I found it on Cades of Gnarsh.
02:08:11 Yeah, OK.
02:08:12 So you see.
02:08:13 I found it on Cades of Gnarsh.
02:08:14 Yeah, it's true.
02:08:14 They are numbered.
02:08:16 They are like Cure 1, Cure 2, Cure 3, Ice 2, Ice 3.
02:08:20 There is, on the heel materia, there are spells which are called Poisona and Isuna,
02:08:25 but those are like Poisona.
02:08:27 That's like a specific cure version.
02:08:28 That's the spell to cure poison.
02:08:29 So it's not, yeah, no.
02:08:32 Right.
02:08:32 Weird.
02:08:33 Well, there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
02:08:36 Anyway, by the way, let's not forget, this guy was 15-year-old Sam.
02:08:40 Ooh, Sam, starting working out at 15 prime, primo time to start lifting.
02:08:46 You're about to, I mean, you're about to fucking have a growth spurt if you haven't already.
02:08:49 It's the best time.
02:08:51 It's perfect.
02:08:51 Right at the beginning of high school or whatever.
02:08:53 You're going to be swole as hell.
02:08:55 And by the way, it is a real thing, noob gains.
02:08:59 Right when you start working out, the going from no exercise to some exercise is by far
02:09:05 the biggest single jump in your fitness growth or whatever.
02:09:10 So he just said he doubled his push-ups.
02:09:12 What's the 80-20 rule?
02:09:13 You get 80% of the results out of 20% of the effort.
02:09:17 We absolutely applies to fitness, no doubt about it.
02:09:19 So yeah, and then make it a habit, keep doing it, dog.
02:09:22 All right, we've got one final voicemail in a similar vein.
02:09:26 This one is, my fitness pal is the most flaccid app on the earth.
02:09:31 All right, go.
02:09:34 Nate, you bitch, mother, cock, suck, fucker, poof.
02:09:37 Listen, you go around recommending my shitness pal.
02:09:43 Listen up, bitch.
02:09:45 Does my fitness pal track micronutrients?
02:09:48 Oh, it tracks vitamin A.
02:09:50 It tracks iron.
02:09:52 Are you going to get your potassium requirements for the day from it?
02:09:55 Like, listen, listen, listen, listen.
02:10:00 When you use chronometer or whatever else app you want to use to track your vitamins,
02:10:04 you actually start to min-max your diet.
02:10:07 You actually start to eat healthy.
02:10:08 You actually start to eat spinach.
02:10:10 Rather than it being like, spinach is this sort of gross food
02:10:13 and I don't really know how much of it to eat, but it's healthy.
02:10:15 So I feel like I should eat one.
02:10:17 You're like, no bitch, I need exactly 25 grams of spinach.
02:10:21 So I can fulfill my vitamin A and vitamin K for the day.
02:10:24 And you can go fuck off and die.
02:10:26 And you don't even need to use these apps very much.
02:10:28 It just gives you an understanding of like, oh my god, broccoli is so high in folate.
02:10:32 This will help me min-max my stats and become a god so easily.
02:10:37 Like, you don't even need to use it for long to get an intuitive understanding
02:10:41 of which vegetables are useful and why you should eat them.
02:10:44 Stop using my fitness pal and go fuck yourself.
02:10:48 Also, love the show.
02:10:49 All right, so that was pretty good.
02:10:53 Sounds like good advice.
02:10:54 What do you say, chronometer?
02:10:55 I think that's what he said, yeah.
02:10:56 I think my roommate uses chronometer.
02:10:59 You know, I hadn't heard of it until I heard that.
02:11:00 He showed it to me and I was like, it looks like that looks complicated.
02:11:04 All you need to know is my fucking macronutrients.
02:11:06 The protein, fiber, carbs, the...
02:11:10 All you need to know is the more green stuff you eat, the bigger you become.
02:11:17 Okay, well first of all, first of all, my fitness battle does track your nutrient.
02:11:21 It does track your micronutrients, not just your macronutrients.
02:11:24 I don't know, maybe not a ton of them.
02:11:25 But I mean, potassium, one of the things he raised, it is tracked.
02:11:28 It is in there.
02:11:29 You just have to go to your nutrition tab in your calorie counting thing.
02:11:33 So it is there and I have used it in the past before, but it is true.
02:11:37 I definitely am an if-it-fits-your-macro shitter and I always was.
02:11:43 But for the record, I was that at like my fitness peak.
02:11:47 So I'll just, I think that Ben's 80-20 thing is true.
02:11:50 Maybe chronometer is just better and I should switch to it.
02:11:53 Maybe this one's a baby version.
02:11:54 That's fair.
02:11:55 But you can obtain incredible results by just counting your macronutrients and not
02:12:02 worrying too much about your micronutrients.
02:12:04 Because if you get your macros right, you will be eating good amounts of vegetable and,
02:12:10 I don't know, stuff.
02:12:10 I mean, sure, it's possible that you won't, but you should.
02:12:14 And that should be part of what you do.
02:12:15 It's kind of inevitable.
02:12:16 So my thinking is that if you're getting your macronutrients right,
02:12:19 that already commits you to a pretty significant commitment to just getting
02:12:23 shit right overall in your diet.
02:12:25 You probably will be getting your micronutrients pretty good as well.
02:12:28 So you don't have to really worry about it that much.
02:12:30 But his point is also valid.
02:12:32 So I don't know.
02:12:33 Try chronometer.
02:12:33 See what works better for you.
02:12:35 Just as long as you're putting some energy into it,
02:12:37 you're probably getting a ton of benefit.
02:12:40 As we said, newbie gains are the biggest single jump.
02:12:42 So just be doing it at all and you're in pretty good shape.
02:12:46 Next one.
02:12:47 Next one.
02:12:48 That's it.
02:12:48 We're done.
02:12:49 That was our last voicemail for all time.
02:12:51 Now that they're over, I miss them.
02:12:53 I feel the same way.
02:12:54 Thank you, everybody, for leaving them.
02:12:55 You can leave more at the speak pipe link in the description.
02:12:59 Keep coming.
02:12:59 It was good batch.
02:13:00 Good batch this month.
02:13:01 Oh, you know what?
02:13:02 We actually had one from Psy, where the gist was that the voicemails are bad
02:13:06 and he hates them because they don't have continuity.
02:13:09 And I didn't want to play little things.
02:13:10 It was a bit long.
02:13:11 Psy of YouTube or Psy of Relief.
02:13:15 Oh, Psy of YouTube.
02:13:17 Yeah, that guy.
02:13:18 Really?
02:13:18 The water park enthusiast.
02:13:19 Yeah, he left a voicemail.
02:13:21 And we didn't play it?
02:13:22 It was kind of long.
02:13:23 And it was just was.
02:13:24 And I mean, he was saying that the voicemails are bad because the dick show does voicemails
02:13:31 and there's a topic of discussion and there's continuity.
02:13:35 Whereas with us, it's all random.
02:13:36 So there's nothing for them to specifically talk about.
02:13:40 And while I agree that could make it better and it might be good to be here.
02:13:44 That's stupid.
02:13:45 That sucks.
02:13:45 That's just not the standard we're looking for.
02:13:48 This show had topics for years and everyone did nothing but fucking complain about it.
02:13:53 Well, to be fair, we never, I mean, we never like would tell people next week is a voicemail
02:13:57 calling with like a relevant voicemail or whatever.
02:14:00 Maybe that, I don't know, maybe that.
02:14:01 Did voicemail and topics even overlap?
02:14:04 Okay, guys.
02:14:05 Okay, guys.
02:14:05 What's next week episode going to be about?
02:14:08 Hey, that actually reminds me.
02:14:09 We don't know what it's going to be about, but you know who will be there?
02:14:13 FitMC is going to be here next time.
02:14:15 And he's going to, yeah.
02:14:16 Why?
02:14:16 FitMC, we just talked to him and, I mean, me and Gabe were talking.
02:14:19 We were like, we should get a guest.
02:14:20 And then we said, let's get Fit.
02:14:22 So he's going to stop by.
02:14:23 Okay.
02:14:24 I guess so.
02:14:25 Yeah, why not?
02:14:26 He's a good man.
02:14:27 We've been saying we should have more guests.
02:14:29 We say all the time.
02:14:30 If you got a voicemail for FitMC, you should send that in.
02:14:33 We should have FitMC.
02:14:34 The same thing you want him to respond to.
02:14:36 That's, you see, I'm glad we brought this up.
02:14:37 That's a good idea.
02:14:38 We should have FitMC on the Minecraft thing when we do the fucking battle.
02:14:43 Yeah.
02:14:43 Oh, is he going to be there?
02:14:45 He should.
02:14:46 He should.
02:14:46 He should be a guest commentator.
02:14:48 Yeah.
02:14:49 I don't know if he cares about Pokemon at all.
02:14:51 Probably not.
02:14:51 But it'd be funny just having that regardless.
02:14:54 I'll ask him if he wants to.
02:14:55 I mean, he, you know, it is, it is sweet.
02:14:57 He was like, dude, I'm like, he was like stoked.
02:14:59 Like now that he's had like a million subs,
02:15:01 there's that thing that happens where he'd be like,
02:15:03 Oh, do I want to like waste his time?
02:15:05 But like, we have such like a little baby thing here.
02:15:07 Do I want to bore him with an offer?
02:15:08 But that probably, you know,
02:15:10 they probably still like to get invited to things.
02:15:11 What about, you know, who is that fucking guy?
02:15:15 You're going to know him.
02:15:15 The guy who on Twitter said that he would be on any podcast
02:15:19 that has over like 5,000 viewers.
02:15:21 Oh, McAfee, McAfee.
02:15:22 McAfee.
02:15:22 We should get fucking McAfee the week after that.
02:15:25 We probably should.
02:15:26 I mean, literally why not?
02:15:28 He'll do it.
02:15:28 You know, you say that and I understand the impulse,
02:15:31 but like why?
02:15:32 What are we going to talk to fucking McAfee about?
02:15:35 Probably should spend a little time thinking.
02:15:37 Like, okay, we could reach out to him.
02:15:38 What will we discuss?
02:15:39 Did you make the subject matter?
02:15:41 The thing.
02:15:42 The virus?
02:15:43 The virus?
02:15:43 The virus?
02:15:43 Computer?
02:15:44 Thing.
02:15:45 Thank you for protecting my computer.
02:15:47 Hey, thanks for fucking up my computer.
02:15:49 Your software fucking sucks, asshole.
02:15:52 I have a virus.
02:15:53 Why did you do that?
02:15:54 Why did you do that, mister?
02:15:56 Did you really kill that guy in that woods or whatever,
02:15:59 in Bangladesh or Bolivia or whatever it was?
02:16:03 So I guess what I'm saying is I don't care about talking to McAfee,
02:16:08 but if anyone else does, whatever.
02:16:11 It sounds fun, but like we should think of what we would discuss with him.
02:16:15 At least a little bit, I think, probably.
02:16:17 I feel like did you?
02:16:18 No, I think it'd be funny if it was like terrible and cringe.
02:16:20 Yeah, we get him on and we're like, okay,
02:16:22 so thanks for agreeing to be on the podcast.
02:16:24 Who are you again?
02:16:26 Oh, that's, see, you know, so like with Fit.
02:16:28 That would be way funnier.
02:16:30 I like, I haven't really been following every detail,
02:16:32 like what Fit's been up to recently,
02:16:34 but I know he's been doing like a bunch of,
02:16:36 like these more like big community Minecraft things.
02:16:38 I don't want to just say,
02:16:39 hey, I haven't looked into this at all.
02:16:41 I don't know what you're up to.
02:16:42 Like, can you just like say it, please?
02:16:44 Can you just like explain to me?
02:16:44 Tell us what is, why you're here and who you are.
02:16:50 We could start it with the classic justify your existence
02:16:54 and just let them take it from there.
02:16:56 Yeah, okay, so call in for Fit.
02:16:59 Hey, Nate, we gotta fucking get out of here,
02:17:01 so we can call our freaking mom on Mother's Day.
02:17:03 That's a half an hour, you're absolutely right,
02:17:05 you're absolutely right.
02:17:05 I just got a call from them on my phone and I didn't answer it.
02:17:09 Bro, epic, suck a fuck, mom and dad.
02:17:14 Yeah, all right, well, let's go do that.
02:17:16 I gotta go fucking install Zoom and shit.
