00:00:00 Fuck me and my fucking asshole, it's, we're back with Rick Stieman. It's everybody season 3 episode 6. Rest in Rick
00:00:08 Laxation. I am the best guy ever and here's Digibro.
00:00:14 We're back. You sound, you sound like you're toxic Digi. You're, I am quite toxic. Toxic animal. Yeah, I'm the toxic Avenger.
00:00:24 This is good episode, man. Yeah, real good episode, real good. I really liked it. This took me back in a way to
00:00:31 what I think is a
00:00:33 lot of the best Rick and Morty episodes, which is take a just really interesting fucking sci-fi
00:00:39 concept and see what you can do with it. Yep. Yep. Which I don't feel like we've had as much of this season.
00:00:45 Maybe the first episode with the whole
00:00:47 Yeah, yeah. Going into like his memories and shit, but the start of season 2 was a lot of this.
00:00:54 Like the, this reminded me of like the planet that was a live episode kind of with the
00:00:59 The usage of the concept and seeing where they could go with it. Planet that was alive as in the
00:01:05 What was her name? Fuck. His girlfriend, that lady? Yeah, the girlfriend. Yeah, okay. I'm with you. I'm with you.
00:01:11 Yeah, this was uh, this is really great shit. Uh, there's no like, there's no like evil foe
00:01:15 to conquer in this episode. So there's no need to like worry or there's none of this shit. We're like, we're, we're second
00:01:21 Guess like, why doesn't Rick just do this? Why doesn't Rick just fucking do it?
00:01:24 No, it doesn't fucking matter because the conflict is internal this episode exactly where it should be for this shit
00:01:29 It felt tight and it's
00:01:32 I kind of love when they
00:01:35 I can call it an excuse, but I think it's clever writing when they put the characters in a situation where they can't
00:01:41 solve it because of just like personal like mental limitations like in this case the
00:01:48 You know, this could be resolved easily if they were whole but the fact is that they're not and that's the whole problem, you know
00:01:54 Yeah, um pussy rick
00:01:57 You know won't go through with what uh other rick would right of course toxic rick
00:02:02 and I mean what makes it interesting is like these are
00:02:05 Like they're approaching it on a level that makes sense to all of us like we can all imagine what our
00:02:10 Toxic sides are and it's really interesting when when you get to the end of the episode where it turns out the toxic parts
00:02:16 Everyone it defines for themselves what their toxic parts are that may or may not be what the rest of us think they are
00:02:22 And that was a fucking great twist. Yeah, it was awesome. It was fantastic
00:02:26 It because it made me realize, you know, like this whole episode
00:02:31 These are the obviously toxic parts of rick and morty that we're seeing the idea ricks a violent
00:02:36 Maniac who thinks he's a god and just you know, it's completely full of himself
00:02:40 But when we find out that this is what rick thinks are the toxic parts of himself
00:02:44 It really recontextualizes it quite a bit that like even he wishes he wasn't like that
00:02:50 But he also wishes he wasn't uh, he didn't have like love and feelings like that, you know
00:02:56 Like he'd like to be a nice polite regular dude, but he still wants to be a cold
00:03:02 asocial, uh, you know
00:03:05 Psycho and it's great and it's great that since like morty kind of like those are the other
00:03:10 The traits that he would consider positive about himself
00:03:13 Like he wants to be that american psycho like a a moral, you know, unfeeling
00:03:18 Cutthroat businessman kind of guy that that rick identifies as like that's what he wants to get rid of
00:03:23 But morty wants to keep those things because of his deep deeper insecurities and it just makes it it's making it so that
00:03:29 None of this is like an objective stance as to like what is actually good and bad about a person by couching it in this
00:03:36 This is how the individual identifies as their bad points
00:03:40 It gives it this great air of subjectivity where it's just
00:03:43 We just get to more understand the characters themselves and how they perceive these things as opposed to like, you know
00:03:48 Dan Harmon making a stance about like, oh if you have feelings if you love your week, you know any of that that bullshit
00:03:53 It's not making that point at all. It's just talking about the characters. It's uh, it's great. It's much more interesting
00:04:00 Smart shit. I will say one thing if I have one complaint or doubt about this episode. It's
00:04:06 Would morty really be this good just by losing his toxic side that did occur to me as well
00:04:11 Yeah, like just by not being such a huge
00:04:14 coward
00:04:16 You know, I mean one of my favorite moments in the entire show
00:04:19 Is in the entire episode is when morty just like confronts rick
00:04:22 He like tells him like you are not fucking getting in the back
00:04:24 It'd be real dangerous for you if you fucking went back and got like our shitty sides
00:04:27 And then as he's walking away fucking football just arrives in his hands
00:04:31 And he fucking tosses his back and keeps going like
00:04:33 Yeah, like the levels of absurdity as to how perfect morty's life has become because he's lost his like are comedically
00:04:40 Just just fucking perfect like they're way over the top and they're great. I love how obnoxious he is
00:04:46 Yeah, and that the episode's willing to just dwell on it like just really like go
00:04:51 They go so hard on like the cornball
00:04:54 element of it like he's just telling stupid jokes that aren't funny and like
00:05:00 For a second I'm like groaning and then I'm like, oh, that's the point, you know, like you got me you mother fucker
00:05:07 I constantly felt that way throughout his scenes and I sort of felt like um
00:05:12 uh
00:05:12 the the elements that propel him to such levels of success are just his absolute confidence and
00:05:18 You know, really that's that that can that can make a huge difference in somebody's life
00:05:21 And you can see like toxic morty, which is his complete like
00:05:26 Disgust with himself on every possible level
00:05:29 Uh, yeah, leaving leaving, you know, healthy morty quote-unquote healthy morty to be just this fucking
00:05:34 Powerhouse of confidence. Yeah, like I can see why he'd do well, you know, when he goes it becomes like a broker or whatever
00:05:40 Uh, yeah, yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense
00:05:43 How my favorite character in this episode is um, what's a random random slut
00:05:49 Big tits make what's a bar. Yeah, I fucking love her. I felt it. I felt a certain
00:05:54 Tingling in my loins when I gazed upon this character
00:05:58 The line where he's uh, when she's like, should I leave and he's like
00:06:03 You're free person do what you want. She's like, I choose to stay
00:06:07 That got me
00:06:10 Yeah, she was a bit of a delight. I liked her a lot
00:06:13 I knew I I was really happy because like I knew that they were gonna end up trapping her in the machine
00:06:20 But what I was really hoping was that either she'd escape or just be like like a badass down
00:06:25 Like I knew she was going to be in the end after credits
00:06:28 Yeah, yeah, like no question after she got trapped in there
00:06:31 And didn't like like I would have been really bummed out if they'd like killed her
00:06:36 You know, and this is I've I've been saying all season that the show has been
00:06:40 writing right on the line between being like overly gross and like and
00:06:46 Inacceptable and like there's still an insane violent scene in this where all these little kids chop off a clown's head
00:06:52 And it's fucking
00:06:54 Horrible, but it was great because it's a character. Nobody cares about it's just a one-off gag
00:07:00 And it's it works really well
00:07:02 Like if this girl had gotten killed that would have been like this is like why why she was likable
00:07:08 I liked her don't kill her
00:07:10 I'm glad this show still has that sense of knowing like when to push the violent button and when not to
00:07:16 And um, you know, it's continued
00:07:19 There's only been like a couple places where I thought like the aforementioned one of the avengers episode
00:07:24 I was like, uh
00:07:25 We have to kill that guy so gruesomely, but it wasn't a big deal and I didn't like that episode anyways, so yep
00:07:30 Yep, you know, but here I felt it was done. Just right, you know
00:07:35 Okay, can I just bring up so people have been making a there's been a contention this whole season that we haven't addressed on this show yet
00:07:43 The issue of the quote-unquote female writers. Are you aware of this? You aware of this meme that's going around
00:07:49 Yeah, I don't like I mean didn't the show always have female writers
00:07:52 I honestly don't know. I thought that I should prepare, but then I also didn't uh, so I have not looked into this at all
00:07:59 I don't know comment people give me give me like reasons to take this seriously
00:08:03 I don't know what this means every time it gets brought up. It's like it's completely inconsequential because
00:08:10 Everyone agrees pickle rick was an amazing episode. It was written by a woman
00:08:14 and then like
00:08:16 So, you know, where do we go from like what what is the side you're trying to take here?
00:08:21 You're trying to say the female writers are good or bad because
00:08:24 We've already proved they've done like the both the best and worst episodes of the season were written by a woman. So
00:08:29 Where you know, I mean all I can tell people make of this is just show me an itemized list
00:08:35 Show me the correlations here because uh pickle rick was perfect
00:08:39 This episode was fantastic
00:08:41 And then the the avengers one and the the mad max one like those are pretty lame overall
00:08:47 So like I don't know if these were like diversity hires that made the show worse
00:08:52 I don't know prove that to me in some way. I don't know do do the work for me people
00:08:56 That's what I'm asking of you. It's I think they're just trying to make it a meme
00:08:59 But like the meme can't stick if the if some of the best episodes are written by women
00:09:04 Like you can't meme it if it's just not even true
00:09:07 I think so people disliked pickle rick just for like they didn't pay attention to how good the episode was
00:09:13 And instead focused on like the memory of it like oh pickle rick
00:09:17 So funny except that episode was fucking great. So, you know, I don't I don't know what there is a complaint about
00:09:22 Um, well, anyway, I don't know
00:09:24 I just thought I'd bring that up like people have been saying that for a while
00:09:26 And I didn't really know if you had any insight to to bring to the no
00:09:30 Like I said, the first thing I heard about it was well pickle registered by woman and I was like, well, okay
00:09:35 Well, there's no problem. I guess women are the best writers then as it turns out
00:09:41 I don't know. I feel like yeah, maybe people are just out to
00:09:45 which hunt on the show for
00:09:47 Seemingly having more women than it had before I don't fucking know
00:09:51 I know everyone who works on rick and morty gets fucking poached. So like
00:09:56 If they hired more women, it's probably because they ran out of whoever was writing the show before, you know
00:10:01 And the new hires are just as good as the old ones. Who the fuck all the goddamn men are ascending too high in the patriarchy
00:10:07 We have to fill these slots with the the lowly women. Hey, what can we do? Uh, so, hey, can we talk about how?
00:10:14 fucking uh, I don't know spine
00:10:16 Shatteringly intense the opening scene of this episode was because I I fucking loved it. It was the coolest thing ever
00:10:23 I was not in control that situation at any point morty that that really fucking got me that uh, that's
00:10:29 Oh, that's another thing
00:10:32 I've I mean we've this has happened many times throughout this show
00:10:36 But the way that this show will have like full blown
00:10:40 Lovecraft shit happened to the minds of these characters and then find a reason to just wipe it under the rug
00:10:46 You know like we had the roy game in season two
00:10:50 Where morty experiences an entire lifetime as another person
00:10:54 We just had in the last episode the whole mind meld for an epoch thing right and now we've got this like
00:11:00 Deep trauma to the point of we're never going on another adventure for both of them for even rick
00:11:06 But then they go to a spa. They're like, you know, well, you're just gonna work through that stress
00:11:11 It'll be fine
00:11:13 That was great. That was great. And I yeah, I just love seeing like the alien spa and all the stuff they were doing there
00:11:17 And I don't know. It's not a major point, but seeing like
00:11:21 Once we saw like toxic rick and toxic morty trapped in the tank and just realizing that they're like in this world
00:11:28 Uh, I don't I don't know something about that was just really cool being in this
00:11:31 like seeing sort of like the uh, sort of the anthropomorphization of like the inside of like this toxic tank
00:11:37 Or or something like that. I don't know something about that was really dope. I really like I really I love this
00:11:42 idea just because of the fact that they they go to a spa
00:11:46 And detox which is like in in reality a load of horse shit
00:11:51 Yeah, like detoxing is not like a
00:11:54 Thing that works as far as I'm aware. I'm pretty sure it's like bro science, you know, it's like a meme to me
00:12:01 Yeah, so like especially the like, oh, I'm going on like a three-day detox right to like swallow a fucking rope and
00:12:08 Then shit it out over the course of three days, you know about those ones like
00:12:13 You know, that's what they're making fun of here, but it's a sci-fi version where not only does it work
00:12:18 But it's like literally everything toxic about you psychologically removed like just such a good idea
00:12:26 And then to make a whole story out of that idea is
00:12:31 It's genius. Yeah, it was great. It's just really smart and uh, you know seeing, you know, uh, uh clean rick
00:12:38 Or a healthy rick, you know being guilted into into bringing back him and and even being guilted like oh morty
00:12:44 We got to reabsorb our darkpots. They're they're part of us morty. We can't we can't live without them. That's uh, I really loved
00:12:51 That rick. I loved fixed rick because they didn't make it
00:12:54 Oh, they didn't overdo it. It didn't make him like a like an actual total pussy. He's just like a reasonable guy
00:13:00 Who's very interested in science, you know, like he just wants to be a scientist man
00:13:05 Like that's that's the rick's perfect vision of himself is just a man who wants to do science
00:13:11 Just a reasonable guy who who wants to do that, you know
00:13:15 And like that's what he would consider an idealized version of himself
00:13:18 But but that that idealized version is such a moralist that he can't stand to leave behind
00:13:25 You know a part of himself that he feels he wronged by you know doing this too. So
00:13:32 By the way, a detriment to himself. He's so self-sacrificing. Yeah. Yeah that he would help this other person
00:13:37 Whereas morty sees himself a perfect version of him would not sacrifice anything for anyone
00:13:42 Yeah, yeah, it's true. It's true. It kind of just shows that uh
00:13:45 Deep down morty is kind of a worse person than rick, you know
00:13:49 At least in the way that like he wishes that he could be you know, he wishes to be this kind of a moral guy
00:13:53 Which I totally relate to I I'm totally in agreement with morty. I would I wish I was that
00:13:58 American psycho morty
00:14:00 I've said many times that my favorite thing about rick is that underneath all the psychopathy
00:14:04 He is a moralist and now we've been made fun of on the previous episode for suggesting that rick was a better person than
00:14:11 Jerry we have because ricks ricks killed so many fucking people and all that shit, but rick also
00:14:17 has
00:14:18 Created entire worlds that run perfectly fine. He's you know create his amount of things
00:14:25 He's brought to the world is possibly
00:14:28 Greater than the amount of destruction he's caused and I mean I would say it probably more likely evens out
00:14:34 Considering that on the council of ricks. They said he was like right in between being a full evil and a full good
00:14:39 He's like the perfect middle ground
00:14:42 Um, but you know a middle ground as a rick is not oh, I don't kill anybody
00:14:47 But I also don't really contribute to society. It's I kill swaths of people
00:14:51 But I also like create entire
00:14:54 Utopias and shit and you know occasionally help people so
00:14:58 Like I do think there's a moral center to rick that's always been there
00:15:03 And whereas morty has you know, he's just an idiot who's been strung into this world where he's developed this nihilistic
00:15:11 Personality and doesn't care about anything for real. So like you know
00:15:16 It's a bit of a bit of a give and take there. It's it's interesting to and I really don't think
00:15:22 Toxic ricks point should be discounted like you you've got to imagine yourself in ricks perspective here
00:15:28 Everyone around him is a fucking like worthless piece of protoplasm
00:15:32 Like he is a literal god compared to these people with with his abilities
00:15:36 Like to even give one ounce of an iota of a shit about any of these creatures that you know
00:15:42 You have access to infinite alternate versions of like
00:15:46 Frank like the the moral labor enacted to do that is frankly more than any of us could possibly imagine
00:15:51 In any of our lives because we're like a lot of us only act kind because we have to act kind or society will destroy us
00:15:58 rick is above society in every possible way
00:16:01 He chooses to act morally none of us ever have to like with how about the great with great power comes great responsibility
00:16:08 Considering the incredible power rick has he is goddamn saintly because he could just evaporate our universe if he felt
00:16:15 And granted he will do that sometimes if he flies off the handle like
00:16:19 We're not saying that he always makes the right choice
00:16:22 But the fact that he ever makes the right choice is almost shocking exactly
00:16:26 You know like like again back in episode two with the the road warrior world
00:16:31 Like if he wanted to he could have just killed everyone and left
00:16:34 But he just didn't I don't know didn't feel up to just murdering everybody that episode
00:16:39 The people the people making those kinds of points
00:16:42 I think should listen to bill burr's comments on tiger woods like all these all these fat middle-aged pieces of shit
00:16:48 Like waddling out when they hear that tiger woods cheated on his wife
00:16:52 They waddle out to their fucking sedans, you know, they're fucking honda civics, and they're like, oh, absolutely
00:16:58 Reprehensible behavior from tiger. Oh, it's absolutely disgusting
00:17:02 Meanwhile, they have never once ever had to face the kind of challenge that tiger woods did at his peak when he would walk
00:17:08 Off the club and there'd be a fucking busload of of fucking uh,
00:17:12 Swedish cheerleaders wanting to fuck him all at the same time
00:17:16 When have you people ever faced the kind of challenge the tiger or rick has never once in your fucking life?
00:17:21 So I don't want to hear you commenting on this shit like oh, why doesn't he just be perfect all the time get fucked
00:17:27 I don't have any sympathy for these people rick is uh rick's uh
00:17:31 He's a he's a complicated man
00:17:32 I like how many times have you crushed an ant in your life at least once probably that's what human beings are like to rick
00:17:38 There's a context people it's a context
00:17:40 Yeah, there you go. Here you go beautiful beautiful rant there. Uh, what the fuck was this episode about again?
00:17:48 I don't know toxic. Uh, hey, uh, how about I was pretty cool when they made the whole world toxic
00:17:53 Uh, that was that was kind of cool
00:17:55 Uh, what did they I all I can remember is them the the children murdering the clown
00:17:59 Oh, the priest the priest being like, uh, got we steal money from you. God's not real
00:18:03 Ha ha tip. Yeah, and then everybody starts fucking and then the people from like
00:18:08 Subarrows and some salad place like switch places for some reason. I was trying to interpret with that joke man
00:18:14 I didn't really understand that one
00:18:15 I think like the fat people went into like the mexican restaurant and then after it went back
00:18:20 They went back to like the salad place. I I don't know. I I lost track
00:18:24 Yeah, I wasn't paying it. It wasn't mexican. It was a subarro. Oh, oh, yes. It's subar right right
00:18:30 Oh, hey, one other cool thing about this, uh, the fight scene between ricks was pretty fucking dope
00:18:34 Especially when they like murdered each other and they had to like
00:18:38 Regrow fucking body. Yeah, that was fucking awesome
00:18:41 Uh, the coolest thing ever
00:18:44 Which is another one that has
00:18:46 Like that's a thing a lot of the coolest tricks in this episode are things that have been done before
00:18:52 Like that is something we've seen we've had a
00:18:56 In episode one when morty knocks over the like the tank with an alien baby and it like grows all the way into old age
00:19:02 In a second. Yeah, we've had rick. Don't think about it morty. Yeah
00:19:06 Yeah, we've had him kill other versions of himself and take their bodies at the start of the season like
00:19:11 We've seen a lot of rick using weird
00:19:14 Regrowth and rebirth techniques, but it's still cool
00:19:17 But I do think this is one of those things where it's like
00:19:20 This show has a limited number of seasons that it can still be impressive like this, you know
00:19:26 Like if we see this another time, it's gonna start to be like, okay, I get it rick can science himself back to life
00:19:33 You know, uh, how many times are we going down that road because I thought it was cool as shit
00:19:38 But I didn't have that shocking like hanging in my psyche like that scene from episode one did with the alien
00:19:44 Don't think about it because I couldn't help but think about yeah
00:19:47 Yeah
00:19:49 You know, this fight kind of reminded me, uh, you know for obvious reasons of uh, you know that fight
00:19:54 I once I first saw it on youtube as the most cartoony anime fight ever between uh, araragi and uh,
00:20:01 Vampire girl where they just pop each other's heads off repeatedly and uh, you know what i'm talking about
00:20:05 If you've seen this I don't think so is it recent it might be from the third keys in monogatari film
00:20:11 It was basically the coolest thing i've ever seen in my entire fucking life and uh, makes me understand why people watch that show
00:20:17 So I gotta fucking do that sometimes
00:20:19 Yeah, yeah
00:20:21 A lot of people would say you should watch the films first because they are technically a prequel to everything else in the series
00:20:26 But aren't prequels supposed to be watched after you know, uh, whatever
00:20:30 I mean, I mean they the book was like the second book, but it's taken them the longest to adapt so yeah, right
00:20:38 Well enough about bullshit anime, uh
00:20:41 This I mean and nothing else. I mean we pretty much covered everything that was great
00:20:44 Oh, hey, how about the uh, the additional little extra layer of character that was added to jessica?
00:20:49 And she like actually seems to have some feelings. Yeah, what's up with that? I don't know man. It seems like it's going somewhere
00:20:56 I mean I can't I can't really remember how she's been treated because she wasn't around much in season two
00:21:02 And hasn't been much for this season so far like she was mostly a plot device in the first season and
00:21:07 It kind of felt like the way they were treating her was she has no personality whatsoever
00:21:12 She's just a prop in whatever the scene is. Yeah, like so
00:21:16 I can't remember if there's ever been a hint of this before the idea that she might have cared about
00:21:21 but
00:21:22 Yeah, other than when she got like love potioned in the uh
00:21:26 Other universe, right? I honestly feel like it's a little bit out of nowhere
00:21:30 Like I she did go on a date with him and I'm sure she was impressed like she said like I think I'd be too boring for you
00:21:36 So that that's an admission that this guy seems to have a lot going on
00:21:39 So she's kind of into him in that way. I think she was
00:21:43 You know, that might have been an excuse or something. Yeah
00:21:46 I think that was a nice way of putting it that she's probably true. I don't know. I feel like they're going somewhere with her
00:21:51 I expect to see more of her at some point
00:21:53 But like Morty wants her bad and she is at least a little bit into him. Just just fucking do it guys just
00:22:00 I wonder if they're trying to set up like because there's a lot of stuff this season that feels like it could be continued on
00:22:05 I wonder if they're trying to set up for like the long haul
00:22:08 Like this isn't going to be stuff that's resolved this season
00:22:11 But it'll be like new overarching stuff for the rest of the show that'll like slowly develop
00:22:16 I almost feel like every episode that we've seen so far has introduced a character that like could come back for like the season
00:22:22 Finality of this like in in this episode. There was uh, you know, the the big tits McGee
00:22:27 Uh in pickle rick. There was like the the that machete guy, whatever his name was l t gray that guy
00:22:34 In episode one there was bird person and what's the face of those guys were obviously kind of like more important characters
00:22:39 I don't know. Oh and uh like bucket head uh x husband of summer
00:22:42 I guess or whatever just seems like there's a bunch of that
00:22:45 I'm wondering if we're gonna
00:22:46 I don't I almost feel like they're setting up for like some big event where they all get together and for like revenge or something
00:22:52 I don't know that that's my prediction
00:22:55 We'll see we'll see I don't think anybody who shows up in an ending gag is going to show up again
00:23:00 I feel like they do that to resolve a character so that we know they won't be back
00:23:04 I know what you're saying that that would make a lot of sense. Then again l t gray
00:23:08 seems
00:23:10 I don't know the fact that he's still out there, you know makes it like I can't see big tits McGee coming back
00:23:15 Because what would she do? Yeah, but but l t gray if that's his name. I I don't know if that's his name
00:23:22 I can't remember
00:23:23 We all know who you're talking about though. Yeah, we'll uh
00:23:27 We'll see man. We'll see as it goes great episode
00:23:30 Really good. Last episode was really good. Pickle rick was really good
00:23:34 Well, let's let's keep this episode one was really good. There's only really been two episodes that we thought were weaker. So that's not bad
00:23:39 That's not terrible. Yeah
00:23:40 It's going it's going okay. I mean
00:23:43 And not even that we thought were terrible just that we're not amazing like below average rick and morty episodes
00:23:49 Which is a dissapointment, but more or less. Okay. Yeah, I was a force on when I was like
00:23:54 but yeah, I mean I
00:23:57 There's episodes of seasons one and two that I think are worse than the others. So this is not new
00:24:02 I don't expect to show to bat a hundred at all times, but it is definitely fucking still solid. Absolutely as long as they keep
00:24:10 Bringing in new ideas. I just I hope they stay away from like if there was like another mr
00:24:15 Meeseeks episode or just anything like reusing old ideas
00:24:19 Even in small ways would be that would be an indication that things are starting to dry up
00:24:23 But as long as they keep doing stuff like this
00:24:26 Yeah, this is good. Like this is just a new idea. That's like that's the kind of stuff that we I promise we will see that if
00:24:32 Dan or
00:24:35 or
00:24:36 Justin ever left the show. Oh, yeah, for sure. You know for sure
00:24:39 They'll laugh on those tangible details as hard as they fucking can if those guys leave
00:24:44 Which I mean Justin voices half the characters and Dan voices the other half
00:24:48 So like they can't it would be real hard to do the show without the moment
00:24:52 Yeah, that's true. Well, we're here's hoping good so far. Keep it up guys
00:24:58 All right. Yeah, peace
00:25:02 Kill me
