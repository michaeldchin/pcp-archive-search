00:00:00 Greetings all, and welcome back to another episode of the Bro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Nate
00:00:10 Bodzman, who are joined by Ben... Ben the Bodd Saint. Yeah, that's the one. And Hippo.
00:00:19 Justify your existence. Did you say Hippo? I did not. I was still asking you to justify...
00:00:24 You know I can't do that. Bibbon Bake is here. Hey guys, I'm here to bake cake. You know, I'm
00:00:34 absolutely certain that... By the way, Gibb, I'm sorry, this episode is sponsored by the
00:00:38 B emoji, the big red B emoji. Venus, yes. I prefer the blue one, but alright. Okay. For all of the
00:00:45 millions of people who are currently typing, oh my god, Ben, oh my god, Ben and Nate on the
00:00:51 fucking PCP. I can't believe it. I got it unsubscribed right now, they say. The 15th time they've said it.
00:00:58 Hippo, I saw your comment on the last episode, and I really liked it. As much as I love people
00:01:06 shitting on Ben, you gotta give him a chance, ladies and gentlemen. So you don't have to go by,
00:01:12 someone made a comment that was just like, saw Ben was on this episode, did cancel, deleted,
00:01:18 and Hippo was like, guy, you don't have to be afraid of him. I know. If I can talk about animal
00:01:24 crossings. I think you can too, ladies and gentlemen. I have to live with him. Nate tolerates it.
00:01:31 All the rest of the idiots deal with him. You have to pay, and that's great.
00:01:37 They love it. Well, there it is. They love Finn doming us. Wait, are they Finn doming us,
00:01:42 or are we Finn doming them? I think we're Finn doming them. Is Finn doming where there's a furry
00:01:49 dolphin and then double matrix? Is that guy from Adventure Time, or he tells you what to do, he
00:01:53 puts you in a hat? I can't hear anything. It's my fault, but I will quickly say that Finn doming
00:01:57 is when you're like, hey, hey, you fat loser who I will never have sex with, give me money,
00:02:04 and then they do. Right, like watching an episode of Adventure Time. It sounds like just bullying,
00:02:10 but, you know, smart. Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, the way I'm saying with it,
00:02:14 cuckoldery can be, and originally was, just simply a fetish that some people enjoyed,
00:02:19 even though they are weirdos, but you know, it's okay to be a weirdo sometimes.
00:02:22 Speaking of weirdos, all right, here's what I've been thinking about all the time, every day,
00:02:26 all day, and especially just right now, is the Digi's neuro typing chart that came out,
00:02:32 and the whole like, lexical and impressionist and lateral and linear and putting yourself on
00:02:38 the chart and thinking about the chart and seeing where all the things go on the chart,
00:02:43 and I really like charts. I really like it. I wish Digi was here to talk about it a little more,
00:02:48 because I am, I'm big stupid. Well, I'm not stupid, right? But I always thought I was stupid,
00:02:56 until I realized I just, I think in colors and shapes and feelings and entire videos, like,
00:03:05 instead of words. Well, that doesn't rule you out from also being stupid.
00:03:09 Yes, this is also a case. But it's like, I was just thinking the other, like today,
00:03:16 it's like, wouldn't it be great if like, instead of somebody asked me a question,
00:03:20 and I have to like, think of all the words that like, creates. What do I miss? What do I miss?
00:03:24 We're talking about Digi's neuro typing. Can you hear me? It's still says I muted.
00:03:29 It still says I muted. Okay, whatever. Well, okay. If you hear me, it's on.
00:03:33 All right, there we go. Yes, yeah. Anyway, what did I miss?
00:03:35 Ellie, is there a cut that? No.
00:03:38 No, that was gold. Okay, I'm sorry.
00:03:40 Neurotyping, we're talking about.
00:03:42 Oh, what is all this I've been hearing about neuro typing?
00:03:45 It's, it's when it's when it's when it's when lol, that's what all you need to know.
00:03:52 Okay, I'm listening.
00:03:53 So, all right, I was thinking about the fact that I am pretty impressionist on this chart,
00:03:58 this, you know, made up bullshit chart, but it is, it does say some truths in a way.
00:04:03 What chart?
00:04:04 The neuro typing chart. Oh, Ben doesn't even know the basics.
00:04:06 You don't even know the basics. I don't know what you're talking about.
00:04:08 Digi made. I've been seeing this word thrown around a lot.
00:04:10 All right, I will, I will try to explain. There is two axes.
00:04:16 And we, is it, is it, is it galaxy brain versus smooth brain?
00:04:20 Not quite.
00:04:21 No, I think that was one I made.
00:04:24 It was, what was the third axis?
00:04:26 Oh, cringian based.
00:04:27 Wrinkle? Wrinkle versus.
00:04:29 No, cringian based was one.
00:04:31 Galaxy. Smooth brain and galaxy brain.
00:04:33 And there's a third one.
00:04:35 What was it, big brain versus small? Did you?
00:04:37 No, that's smooth and galaxy.
00:04:39 It's a, is it Chad versus Virgin?
00:04:42 Oh yeah, Chad versus, yeah.
00:04:43 No.
00:04:43 Yeah.
00:04:44 Okay, if you say so.
00:04:45 The chart, the virgin smooth brain, something or other.
00:04:51 I was, I am, I am definitely Chad, Chad cring galaxy brain.
00:04:56 Oh, we should put.
00:04:57 Actually, no, no, no, I'm Chad virgin neutral on Chad virgin.
00:04:59 We should put, we should put all of the different iterations of that chart on the neuro typing chart.
00:05:04 Yes.
00:05:04 Right, right.
00:05:05 All right, so where each, the neuro typing chart is a thing Digi concocted, which
00:05:12 in a, in a brief summer summary,
00:05:17 depicts on a scale or a chart,
00:05:21 your way of thinking in terms of how you communicate ideas to other people
00:05:28 and how you think those ideas.
00:05:32 So on the left and right, there is lexical on the left and impressionist on the right.
00:05:38 Lexical is people who think heavily with words and can't understand things that are like vague
00:05:45 and sort of airy, fairy, weird, like, like jazz or whatever.
00:05:50 They need things to be regimented and codified in a language that has rules that they can follow.
00:05:56 So they are very particular about words.
00:05:59 And the other side of the spectrum of that is people who understand the gist of things
00:06:06 far easier without needing words to be involved.
00:06:09 And they can use words interchangeably without feeling that there's any problem with that,
00:06:14 which is why there's so much, you know, miscommunication between different types of people,
00:06:19 depending on where you are on the chart, you, you know, I'm very impressionistic,
00:06:24 which is why I struggle with words constantly.
00:06:27 And I'm like stupid.
00:06:29 Impressionism sucks.
00:06:31 This post was made by lexical gang.
00:06:33 Fucking lexies.
00:06:34 I thought of, I thought of disparaging terms, right?
00:06:37 The lexies, that those, the thing.
00:06:40 And then the other time, the other side is the imps.
00:06:43 Fucking imp.
00:06:44 Yeah.
00:06:44 Fucking imp doesn't know how to fucking string a sentence together.
00:06:47 Stuttering.
00:06:48 What about, what about, um, what about pressies?
00:06:51 Pressies?
00:06:52 Oh, what's the drug over there?
00:06:54 Oh, no.
00:06:55 Oh, like imp, okay.
00:06:56 Yeah, maybe.
00:06:56 Just talking around ideas.
00:06:58 You know, there's no such thing as a bad idea.
00:07:00 There's no such thing as a bad question, only a bad idea.
00:07:02 Sounds like impressionistic thinking, and I hate that.
00:07:04 Anyway, it's really funny as a meme, but I also really like it.
00:07:07 And on the other side of the, the graph going up and down.
00:07:10 I've been, people were calling me an externalist on Twitter the other day, and I didn't know.
00:07:14 Yeah, that's where he placed you, I think.
00:07:16 The graph is split up into like squares that have names.
00:07:20 I don't really, I'm not so far, like, that I understand all of these different titles
00:07:26 within the chart, but I do, I generally agree with the, the fact that there's a sliding scale.
00:07:32 Left to right, lexical, and impressionist.
00:07:35 That's the way you think.
00:07:38 If you haven't seen it, Ben, this is Digi's thing.
00:07:40 This is where he put all of us.
00:07:42 I found his tweet with the placement image.
00:07:44 Yeah, I am him.
00:07:45 And then a top to bottom, at the top is-
00:07:48 You're a centrist, Ben.
00:07:49 You're a fucking centrist.
00:07:50 At the top means, I guess so.
00:07:53 At the top is lateral thinking, and at the bottom is linear thinking.
00:07:57 I'm not quite as sure about what this means.
00:08:02 I've been struggling with this one too, but I know that lateral means you have multiple
00:08:07 lines of thought at any one time.
00:08:09 Lateral is like thinking outside the box.
00:08:11 Yes, and linear is being like on one point focused on like one idea at a time, is my
00:08:16 understanding.
00:08:17 The way I've been thinking about it is that if you're very linear, you can focus on a
00:08:21 task a lot more easily than someone who's laterally minded, because-
00:08:24 Maybe it's like one really thick band as opposed to many thinner bands or something.
00:08:29 So like a linear person will focus on one task, but will find it hard to multitask,
00:08:34 and a person who is lateral can, it's not always a rule that they can literally multitask,
00:08:39 but they can have multiple different thoughts going through the head, which may
00:08:43 like interrupt each other and get in the way of each other.
00:08:46 I know from, you know, you may have heard multiple times where I start a sentence,
00:08:53 and then I think of a better way to say the sentence before I finish the first sentence,
00:08:58 and then I start the next one, leading to confusion and like me sounding like I don't
00:09:03 know what I'm saying.
00:09:05 Sure, I would do that too.
00:09:06 All of this sort of like this stuff has been, it's been cool, and I can't think of the words,
00:09:13 but which is the frustrating thing.
00:09:14 Knowing that I can't think of the words is helpful for me just to think like a ground,
00:09:21 like a foothold from which I can start to like actually analyze how to do things in life.
00:09:29 But still, I don't have the words for it, and I need some lexical people to explain
00:09:34 this chart in more words so that I can understand it better and make videos about them and say
00:09:40 the words instead of writing them, because I can't read, I don't like reading.
00:09:44 You know what I think was a, did I mention this last time that like you and me doing
00:09:47 the potty cast together, it was funny at the beginning how we totally approached it from
00:09:51 like totally opposite sides of like appreciating this same thing that we both loved one piece.
00:09:57 It's funny how things fit on the chart so easily, because it's such a broad idea,
00:10:02 and you know, diametrically opposed things, of course, there's going to be the most extreme
00:10:07 and the least extreme of that. So it's like it's a very, it's a good chart, I like it.
00:10:14 You know, maybe this is my lexic lexibias or whatever, but inherently I'm skeptical of all
00:10:21 sorts of charts like this and personality typing things, because I feel that they are designed
00:10:27 at least partially as a tool for people to jack off about how special they are,
00:10:32 and they could be sitting down and doing spreadsheets instead.
00:10:36 I mean obviously a two-dimensional chart can only tell you so much.
00:10:40 Did you, of course, we can see that, he said so himself.
00:10:44 It's funny how it seems to be across the board, lexies always think that the chart is cute,
00:10:50 but whatever, and then impressionist people are like, this is so important to me, I need this
00:10:55 chart, I love this chart. I don't think it's so much that we want to feel special, I think it's
00:11:03 just that it is a way of understanding thinking patterns that goes a lot further than any other
00:11:14 like book we've ever been told to read, or like any other explanation we've heard before, this is
00:11:20 more of like a way to think that is, see, I don't know, sure, as like a tool of education
00:11:29 into how one thinks, I find this perfectly reasonable, but it does strike me typically,
00:11:33 because I think that probably men in general would be more left, or more lexical, and women would be
00:11:38 more impressionist, whatever, it does strike me as girl shit, like, like, like INJTP, it is girl
00:11:50 shit, but that's fine. And I hate girl shit. Girl shit is okay, sometimes, said Ben, coming out as
00:11:55 trans, coming out as girl, girl leaning, sometimes girl shit is okay too, he said. And you know what,
00:12:04 gun down in a hail of bullet. Michelle did this, see this is the thing, Michelle did this, and I
00:12:09 had to savagely beat her with my belt for it, she looked at the chart, and so originally externalist
00:12:14 was called Room Brightener, which was a very positive time. Room Brightener? It was called
00:12:19 Room Brightener, originally. Did you intentionally tone down the positivity of several of these
00:12:25 categories, because they sounded too cool? Well, and tone down the negativity of some others.
00:12:29 That's certainly true, that's true. To make the words as neutral as possible. The mother's
00:12:34 basement one was intentionally designed to sound shitty. Well, because what he was doing,
00:12:39 the first video he made was he, it was the one where it's like how think with the anime girl
00:12:44 thinking, how anime characters think. And he placed a bunch of anime characters in these
00:12:50 categories, and at the time, Room Brightener's worked with all the anime characters that he was
00:12:55 putting there. But it's a little more like broader than specifically brightening a room,
00:13:02 like it's a bad description of that. So like, certain words were changed. It's all like,
00:13:08 in the process of being created, it's very like communal, people are coming up with
00:13:12 ways to interpret it and different, you know, tweaks you can make to make the chart more
00:13:17 accurate to real human thinking patterns. All our commenters would surely agree that I
00:13:24 brighten every space that I enter. I darken every doorstep I try to cross personally.
00:13:32 But it's interesting to note, me and Michelle have long said that there are some interesting
00:13:37 similarities and personality between you and Michelle. And I mean, yeah, we've kind of just
00:13:43 been like, well, specifically it comes into like my more, I don't know, like, I guess lexical is
00:13:48 one way to put it, like thought about things where Michelle is like more lackadaisical and
00:13:54 going with the flow and stuff. And I don't know, for whatever reason, it's come into discussion
00:13:59 that like, oh, you know, Ben's kind of more like you, Michelle. Maybe I want to fuck Ben. Maybe
00:14:02 that's, you know, the general idea. Let's discuss this at a later date.
00:14:10 Anyway, but of note, Michelle looked at the chart, didn't understand at first, like how it worked,
00:14:16 and said, I'm a room brightener. And I was like, Michelle, no, the worst thing you can do is look
00:14:21 at the chart and pick the one you want to be. But then we went through and we're like, oh,
00:14:24 you probably do fit in that category anyway. So it was like, why, why is it now called externalist?
00:14:30 I think straight up because room brightener sounds really, really positive. Yeah, yeah,
00:14:35 yeah. But why, why is it called externalist? What does that mean? I assume it's trying to
00:14:39 communicate the same idea that these people, they, they express, because if I'm supposedly one,
00:14:47 I want to know what that says. There's a Reddit made, there's a Reddit board about the Digi
00:14:54 neurotyping thing where people are discussing. I think there's a few like write ups of all of
00:15:00 the descriptions Digi gives and then people's commentary on like what each of these categories
00:15:05 names are and what they mean. So you can look that up. Actually, the creation of that first video,
00:15:11 which I'll, which I'll link Ben, you can just skip straight to the externalist section if you
00:15:14 want to hear what that is, which is cool. The real bombshell here is how when I watched this video
00:15:19 for the first time, it now had that new seek bar thing on mobile where you can fucking like,
00:15:24 it tells you like the chapter sections of the fucking episode on YouTube. It was like the
00:15:29 coolest thing ever. If, if on mobile, you go to this video, you haven't, I mean, it's on my phone
00:15:34 now. I don't have the app actually. I don't use the app because I can't add block through it.
00:15:40 The thing about room brightener is shadow guardian. I think that was changed as well.
00:15:46 What the fuck? Yeah, that was changed to overseer, which again, you can see
00:15:52 very weird. I mean, it makes sense if these are supposed to describe anime characters.
00:15:58 Yes. Yes. Which was the conceit origin, I think. And I feel like bottom left reasonable people.
00:16:05 And then far bottom left middle man, middle manager is highly derogatory. And of course,
00:16:10 that was mother's basement square in the center of that one. But that's been changed to bookkeeper,
00:16:15 which is still doesn't sound great. That's a little, that's neutral. That's fine.
00:16:21 Anyway, so the thing with, you know, all this, like it's totally like understandable
00:16:28 to question what is the point? Like who cares where you are on the chart? Everybody is on the
00:16:34 chart somewhere, but what does it matter whether you know or not? And I'm still trying to think,
00:16:40 figure that out. I would hope that what it does is allow me to like talk or like get advice for
00:16:46 people like me on how to think better, because I've noticed that this pattern, it really,
00:16:55 what it's done is that it's made me realize that a lot of the ways I think and a lot of the problems
00:17:00 in my life are caused by this way of thinking. And it's like a square peg round hole situation
00:17:08 where I haven't been trying to adapt my life to accommodate for this. I've just been trying to
00:17:14 force my way into the way everyone else thinks and does things. And so I'm like, sort of experimenting,
00:17:20 thinking of different ways to approach lots of problems, so that, so that I can better like,
00:17:28 you know, exist, you know, so that I can one stop being depressed quite so much, do art better,
00:17:35 various things that just sort of like hamper my life based on the ways that I approach
00:17:40 lots of things based on the ways I think. And so there's just been pretty, pretty cool
00:17:46 thinking about it, but I don't yet have the words. And I need a big, stupid, smart guy to
00:17:54 say all the words for me, a stupid, drooling lexical God to explain in clear terms what I
00:18:03 should do. Maybe what you need is, I mean, I don't know, it makes me think of like Bakuman,
00:18:09 how like the two guys were such a great team, because one guy was like the words man and the
00:18:13 other guy was the art man. Yeah, that's what I mean. It's like a, it's like a, I know the problem,
00:18:19 but the solution is like ridiculous, like, Oh, wouldn't it be great if like somebody just understood
00:18:24 me? That's all I need. Yeah, it's like, Oh, well, how are you going to do that? How are you going to
00:18:28 find that? I guess the good news is you're already working in like a career path that that's pretty
00:18:33 I mean, in the arts. Pretty good. Yeah. Here's the thing, right? I was thinking, wouldn't it be
00:18:42 right? This is this is tangentially related. But I was thinking about Google and how search
00:18:48 engines suck and I hate them. And they've never been good for me ever. Because specifically,
00:18:54 you need to know the words of the thing you're searching for before you can find it.
00:18:58 Ah, right, right. If you don't know the words to use, I mean, this is like a
00:19:04 tangentially related because Google is a computer and computers just work like that,
00:19:07 you need to know the words to use properly in order to like key words and all that.
00:19:13 So if you're looking for something like an image of a character, you already know what the character
00:19:18 is called. That's fine. But it's not searching. It's just like recalling. You're just gaining
00:19:25 like access to something you already know what it is. You type in Princess Peach, you know what
00:19:29 she looks like. You get loads of images of Princess Peach. You have reaffirmed what Princess Peach
00:19:33 looks like. You know, it's it's not learning anything. You're not getting anything. The
00:19:37 problem. And I totally understand this problem. It's like, but what if what you remember is,
00:19:42 I remember there's like a blonde prince or there's a blonde girl with a pink dress and there's like
00:19:47 a blue like you have a visualization, but you can't just communicate that to a computer. You
00:19:52 could type pink dress girl blonde hair. You can you can try you can try you can try really hard
00:19:57 to like get as many vague similar key words. But this is like a it's like a metaphor for this
00:20:03 this lexical impressionist thing is that I think so much in terms of like feelings and
00:20:10 emotions and and colors and shapes and like baby gay girl shit that when I go to try and
00:20:18 explain myself, I don't have the necessary words at my disposal to make people understand
00:20:25 anything I'm saying. And it's sort of like it's a brick wall I keep hitting like if in the future
00:20:32 if I could go, hey computer. So there's this like this this thing like and it's like this
00:20:39 and the computer's like oh yes, I understand exactly what you you're looking for. Here's what
00:20:42 it is called is called this is the definition and it's like oh god imagine a world imagine a
00:20:47 Star Trek world where I can go to a computer and the computer can understand me better than a
00:20:51 fucking human being can they can scan into my like fucking neurons and find it like here's all the
00:20:56 neurons here's where they're going this is what this is what this guy is thinking of in a picture
00:21:01 and I'm going to scan the entire internet to find out what it is and tell him I would love that
00:21:06 that's all I want you know what's funny about that that one tiny thing technology like that of
00:21:13 course does exist in Star Trek but like the main community I'm watching Voyager now and the main
00:21:18 communication things they'll say like computer access like all Starfleet records on you know Alpha
00:21:24 Prime planet or whatever give me like the historical context of like Vagundo Braxis the 14th like the
00:21:31 warlord and then they'll be like this man was a blah blah blah and he did XYZ it's all totally
00:21:36 lexical still in like the way that the Federation operates with their computers but then there's
00:21:42 like the weird episodes were like whoa this this alien race is like brain-skinning technology
00:21:47 like we've tried that but it's a little risky it's a little dangerous so I don't know I guess
00:21:51 there's probably there's probably like a lexical bias in the Starfleet way of doing things which is
00:21:56 interesting I mean that's why the show attracts me so much because it's like a big talky word show
00:22:01 or something yeah I mean I do like talky words I think that there was a thing Digi said at one
00:22:07 point in like a stream where he was talking about this neuro typing thing about the idea of the flow
00:22:14 of communication like certain types of people can explain things to other types in like a sort of
00:22:20 sort of swirly pattern or around the chart and so certain types of people are like really good at
00:22:26 communicating ideas like translating ideas from one area to another and I really want to see what
00:22:34 his like flow chart looks like because then if it's if it's accurate it would be handy to like
00:22:41 figure out what sort of people would maybe be able to figure out how to talk to me about things or
00:22:46 how I can explain things to other people and who they would be and I don't know I'm just really
00:22:52 interested in all of this because up until this point like I was saying it's all just been me
00:22:57 hitting my head against a brick wall thinking that I am just a retard that can't function in
00:23:01 society and it may still be the case but at least I have a label now and that's all I need
00:23:06 as I label and now I'm cool now I have an identity and I could cling to it with my claws.
00:23:14 I had an interesting experience to the day it was just a small microcosm of this I was just
00:23:19 watching the anime Dragon Maid is an awesome show and the opening is Aozorano Rhapsody
00:23:27 it's Blue Sky Rhapsody or whatever and it's by this group called Fana or maybe that's the girl
00:23:31 leader name I don't know and I was just like looking over their catalog at some of their
00:23:34 shit and I just like was looking at some of their song names and it's all in like Japanese and
00:23:39 fucking kanji and shit that I don't I don't actually understand or read but like as I was
00:23:43 looking over them I saw a bunch of kanji and I was like oh you know I can't remember how to
00:23:48 pronounce any of these kanji but I know that that is the kanji that represents like the concept of
00:23:54 like girl or woman and so I was I was looking at these like characters not actually knowing how to
00:23:59 pronounce them or say them but I got like a weird it was a weird sensation in my brain of like I got
00:24:05 the feeling of what these words were attempting to convey but not the actual like spoken definitions
00:24:11 of them and I don't know it was like a very impressionistic experience I saw like there was
00:24:15 like woman and like kind of like mother I think and I don't know girl and like school or something
00:24:20 and some of them I recognized outwardly others others I didn't but I knew like the meaning behind
00:24:24 them and I was like I don't know that's like an interest I with letters in general in English
00:24:29 every letter just has a sound and it's only in combination they take on any meaning but with
00:24:33 a language like that specific kanji actually means specific concepts sometimes so I don't know
00:24:40 I guess it's just like a a fast of the language that is slightly more impressionistic
00:24:45 I don't know I just thought that was interesting and I enjoyed it there's I thought that was
00:24:49 interesting yeah I thought lots of things were interesting um I that that is kind of an interesting
00:24:56 thing though it's like um no one person is entirely one thing or the other everybody can of course
00:25:03 be lexical I mean I'm speaking words that means I can you know parse words in language and get
00:25:09 them out um I can translate somewhat nobody is completely off the edges so that so that they
00:25:16 can't do any of the other things it's all I think uh like a a an ease of use how easy is it for you
00:25:23 to think in this particular way that's where you are on the chart when it comes to like getting the
00:25:28 gist I'm very good at that when it comes to explaining what the gist is it takes months
00:25:33 which is why it's so difficult for me to make like analysis videos because I do understand all of
00:25:38 this stuff but it's so hard to get it out it's so hard to get it out like all I would want to do is
00:25:43 like to open my mouth and like the video game would play an entirety out of my mouth that's all
00:25:48 right that would be the perfect translation for me you just play the video game I don't need to
00:25:52 talk about it you should just play and you'll get it but you can't you can't do that you need to
00:25:56 translate it so that people will understand because not everybody thinks like me and that's
00:26:02 that's just the way a lot of things are it makes me think our anime loving audience on this
00:26:08 anime exclusive discussion podcast uh would would would perhaps appreciate this example
00:26:13 in hunter hunter there are six different nen usage types that you can use and if you are on one side
00:26:19 of the hexagonal chart or whatever the opposite side you like lose efficiency at when you're
00:26:25 attempting to perform that type of nen stuff whatever so I think if you're like an emitter
00:26:30 which means you like send nen out of your body you can do that at 100 but like I don't know
00:26:35 whatever the opposite is of that manipulation someone's gonna tell me which is wrong or whatever
00:26:39 that's like the opposite type of nen so you're less good at it so it takes more effort for you to do
00:26:44 someone who would naturally be born that way or something like that like a like a yellow slime
00:26:49 way trying to attack a magenta slime way you know exactly it's just not gonna work out it's gonna
00:26:54 take more energy and yeah being yeah you better hope you uh you better hope you um you put some
00:27:00 stats into grit let's hope so well you know actually uh as a as a small segue from that I
00:27:08 was thinking how there if you are probably a more lexical kind of guy you'd probably have an easier
00:27:14 time uh with like the the pcp lecture format that uh that we have done and people enjoyed yes true
00:27:20 it's right there in the name indeed indeed it is uh but then again I mean guys like muncher way
00:27:26 impressionistic but then his style is very different when he does it and like wait muncher's not on the
00:27:32 chart no oh yeah he's on the top right he's uh he's that uh he's the fucking Kirby he's Kirby there
00:27:38 under devote oh i'm that's munch i missed it lol okay um well thank guys it's just the Kirby like one
00:27:45 of the yeah that's just Kirby uh oh and I was gonna say um uh as a as a segue from that I noticed
00:27:52 I didn't really hear much about this but I saw yesterday streaming apparently on corrupting
00:27:57 your kids I think this is like a May initiative or something ash vampire doing an online digital
00:28:03 bionicle seminar clearly in the style of like the uh the pcp uh lecture series I have not watched
00:28:10 a notification for that yeah yeah I haven't watched it yet but I notice it's scanning through it looks
00:28:17 like the lecture goes for about four hours and I think there's like an hour and a half of questions
00:28:22 at the end there is another um there was an older video from like a con like some at some convention
00:28:28 someone held a panel where they basically gave a um a bionicle lore lecture was it pcp inspired at
00:28:34 all no no it's older than that okay oh I say I say hold on bionicle I can find it a bionicle
00:28:42 panel ah shit videos New York comic con 2012 bionicle panel I always liked the original
00:28:50 bionicle masks and then the soon as they made the second generation they were stupid they were
00:28:55 sort of like blood to death yeah I mean I want to I want to check this out and swervy and too much
00:29:03 bells and whistles and it's like it was perfect before just stop stop right now I was never that
00:29:08 into bionicle but I can't help notice that in the comments people are referring to fans of bionicle
00:29:14 as bonkelheads and I love that I want to be a bonkelhead myself bonk uh incredible incredible uh
00:29:23 I I hope it's good I haven't checked it out but it seems people have long said that someone should
00:29:28 do a bionicle lecture because the lore is insane but none of us know they're they're already there
00:29:33 already is one I mean the one yeah you're right you're right if this is the one that I'm thinking
00:29:37 of it's not that long it's only like 40 minutes okay okay I'm sure there could be more but like
00:29:42 yeah it's it is a good it's a good idea for a topic there's like a super edgy one guy in there who's
00:29:51 like half demon half angel bionicle and he's the chosen one I I don't know I know there's one guy
00:29:57 that people always bring up as like the bionicle guy that makes this shit it's just pokemon like
00:30:03 all of the generations suck except the first one I wonder if you would agree well ash congratulations
00:30:12 and pantsu for hosting or whatever but about the format itself a couple of people were saying like
00:30:18 hey you guys should do like online seminars or you don't have to know there might have been a voicemail
00:30:22 about this you don't have to wait for red foxy socks ketu I think oh yeah okay about don't you
00:30:28 remember don't you remember a voicemail from last week when he said that he had a couple in mind
00:30:33 and he was considering whether to do them online oh that's right I might have added another one this
00:30:38 week that was about a similar kind of thing no no matter but uh and you know I not to say anything
00:30:43 negative but I just think that obviously online you have questions there you got people right there
00:30:49 but having a real live audience is I'm sure you could do it and it would work yeah it would be
00:30:54 different I'll have to check this out I will have to watch at least a bit of this and see how it goes
00:30:58 and uh see there's engagement I mean I don't see any reason why you couldn't just like talk about a
00:31:05 thing in a Skype call or whatever just talk about it into a webcam yeah I mean that circle
00:31:11 ask questions as I'm sure it would work it might even be just as good I don't know I wonder how
00:31:17 much I mean this isn't really a credit to us or anything necessarily but like I wonder how much
00:31:20 the victor factor is uh is like uh you know like all the zooms and the pans to interesting things
00:31:27 going on oh yeah in terms of like product but I wonder how many people watch the entire thing
00:31:36 that's a great question victor would probably relatively few like the victor factor probably
00:31:41 helps in making it interesting to watch because it's high def and it's not a static shot so
00:31:47 people may end up watching the entire thing because you know that you're sitting down people
00:31:52 are also sitting down you feel like you're sitting down with the people I kind of even feel that
00:31:56 like the fact simply the fact that like there's people together in one place and there's a camera
00:32:02 gives a level of what appears to be like professionalism or like
00:32:06 legitness that like makes people feel like oh I want to be engaged with this this is like a thing
00:32:12 people cared uh I think that like videos that involve more than one person always seem to like
00:32:18 get a a layer of like legitimacy or I don't know cred because like oh I mean if you give the
00:32:24 impression that you're just like a guy talking into a microphone and that's like all there is to it
00:32:30 then yeah it's like you know you might come off as unprofessional or it's like just some guy who
00:32:35 gives a shit what this guy thinks it rad con though when there's organization and a budget behind it
00:32:41 you know you're like these guys are important I if I don't know what these guys are talking about
00:32:45 then I'll be out of the conversation but all that being said though I hate to even put any kind of
00:32:49 negative veneer this is really cool that ash did this with uh with the squad here so I would I
00:32:53 want to check it out and uh Gratz yeah sure hope it went well I don't know I have not watched it
00:32:58 that was interesting I I'm wondering like how good the image of the the whiteboard would be like
00:33:05 could people see it oh there is a link in the description to the whiteboard uh I'm going to
00:33:11 oh it's on screen a picture or something yeah here I'm I'll see if I can post it wait a minute
00:33:18 the url does and wait did it not work uh I think it's broken guys uh shout out to the
00:33:26 bionicle lecture guys I think your url is broken and it is not taking me where I need to go so uh
00:33:33 maybe check that out uh give that a double check uh oh they they made the amateur oh man I did this
00:33:39 myself when I was doing like um url shortners they made the amatoir mistake of they put a like
00:33:46 the short url dot blah blah blah blah but they didn't put the HTTPS which means I as a viewer
00:33:52 now have to copy type in pieces into the url stupid and I'm just telling you you're gonna lose a lot
00:33:58 of people in that process a lot of subscriber yeah it's going down the tubes uh so uh consider
00:34:04 consider editing that and also the it's just broken so uh yeah more to the point that might be more
00:34:09 important it simply doesn't work on the board I can see from here though it says oh my god
00:34:14 and even more fascinatingly on the bottom it says how could we have known I wonder what that
00:34:20 is about tantalizing he's setting up the intrigue right away it is good job good job that's good
00:34:25 does anyone remember I guess did either of you play bionicle or with bionicle at all no we might
00:34:31 have had like a couple of the toys all right well for any of the viewers do you remember getting like
00:34:36 in the cereal box like the gamecube sized cd that had like the the fucking small video game about
00:34:42 some of the bionicle characters that was that was that's that's an ancient relic I wish I still had
00:34:47 that that's sick I would love to do that today I had like a open up my had like a amv like of like I
00:34:54 think I had the the green guy the the Rui or something but what a new for the modern age I'll
00:35:01 tell you okay Jeff Bezos listened up this one's for free in every amazon package I want a percent
00:35:07 chance of getting a disc or a fucking a micro usb that contains a bionicle video game or I don't
00:35:15 know a fucking fortnight whatever the kids are into these days remember get me into a quest
00:35:20 a who could forget checks quest I don't know but I saw the AVGN episode on it I had that shit I
00:35:26 loved that shit I was AVGN's uh what was the verdict um what it was like well yeah it was like
00:35:33 who would have thought that a cereal game was so it would be great whoa yeah it's just like it's
00:35:39 just wolfenstein yeah with just doom with checks you can use yeah use brutal doom uh with checks
00:35:48 things and you can use this brutal doom mod yeah it's awesome checks man mod for like doom 2016
00:35:53 or whatever okay wait it can't be 26 oh okay well I assume it mods in checks man like into the game
00:35:59 or something uh yeah that's what I mean just okay make a whole new pack turn all the monsters into
00:36:04 new high resolution high poly renderings of the slime creatures did they now whatever those guys are
00:36:12 that's it like id software had like just invented first person shooters basically did they like work
00:36:17 with id like who actually made that game I think no I think the games like the code was just out
00:36:24 there and people were modding they have always been open source as far as I know so that's probably
00:36:28 what it was fascinating it probably just literally is a friggin doom mod yeah probably
00:36:34 true yeah I think it definitely is that yeah that's so cool uh awesome I I like hey what if we made
00:36:41 it a promotional tool for our friggin corn cereal we've been talking about a couple things uh PCB
00:36:46 race checks checks man checks man uh you know what you know what yeah yeah I want that oh that'd be
00:36:55 six I'm sure I'll make that happen you know we were talking about another game I won't say it but
00:37:00 this one's better this one's better in every way no I would actually I would it sounds kind of dope
00:37:06 now that I think about it yeah sounds super dope I gotta tell you I've been I've been very unproductive
00:37:12 I've been having a very hard time getting anything done dude so we've got that corona ladies and
00:37:16 gentlemen I definitely would jump on some stupid thing to waste my time on for instance practicing
00:37:24 a checks a checks man race checks quest checks quest checks yeah checks quest I do it I'll do it
00:37:31 I'll do anything it sounds fun just this free me I I just like I've been feeling really like
00:37:38 laxadaisical as well it's stupid yeah it sucks that's why I've been thinking so much about like
00:37:44 how to change my brain so I do things it's it's so shit like I I know that like being unproductive
00:37:52 makes me depressed yeah and being depressed makes me want to not do anything it's a it's a vicious
00:37:58 cycle yeah that I'm caught in and I know it but you know vicious black hole yeah I've been in the
00:38:05 vicious cycle of of lack of exercise last while I did an exercise yesterday I feel great of course
00:38:12 whenever you accomplish something you do something I keep thinking right start exercising again for
00:38:16 its mood boosting properties if nothing else that's like yeah one of the one of the great things
00:38:21 about it I've been doing yoga in the morning feel great exercise at night while I did like once
00:38:25 gotta get the pattern going uh yeah once is enough it takes energy it just takes energy
00:38:31 so I'm predisposed to just not want to and it's boring and sucks but I shall endeavor I shall
00:38:36 endeavor to uh to improve and grow and change fortunately I have infinite energy for um tending
00:38:43 roses and animal crossing uh relatable I now have like I have like eight black ones now nice and two
00:38:49 purples oh and I keep getting these fucking pinks and I hate them I don't want them
00:38:53 fucking keep them anyway plant them around your gay neighbors to the pink the rowdy the rowdy roses
00:38:59 just keep sprouting up when I don't want them just keep around invading my my space no matter how
00:39:06 many times you claim all districts they just pop back up damn it we have to we have to answer the
00:39:14 the rowdy question we have to find the final solution and destroy their fun house we what are
00:39:19 you the whole game the whole all of endless war is about trying to solve the rowdy the rq but we
00:39:24 haven't done it yet one day the bq the bust a question hello there man oh you know I've been
00:39:33 getting really funny like using like the the the bad word in like a term that is supposed to be like
00:39:39 softening the blow like who it's great we uh no I uh I've been getting a series of questions on
00:39:47 like whoa from the one piece lecture like whoa because the the buster call like whoa what's
00:39:51 with the hard art like what what was that about am I missing something oh yeah I saw the ball
00:39:55 I've seen a bunch of we got I mean obviously we got that on the buster cast as well of course
00:40:00 guys it's an old word please it's been around yeah you should understand why is the buster call
00:40:08 called the buster call I feel like because it busts all the people I I feel like gun buster die buster
00:40:15 and the buster call I don't know does that word have like some connotation in Japanese it's probably
00:40:20 sounds cool yes one of those things like they it's a hey buster you and they hear it in an American
00:40:27 TV show or movie and they're like haha yes but like you like we we don't call things that
00:40:35 like no nobody's ever I don't know it just seems like a name like an English name that an American
00:40:41 thing would never be called so I have to wonder like that's definitely true why does it pop up
00:40:46 here and there I think that unexpected places in other languages particularly Japanese which we
00:40:51 hear a lot of people who watch anime and play video games and shit uh I think they just like don't
00:40:57 have I don't know the same kind of like thought process we have when we hear like a word in English
00:41:02 and they they really do just lean on what kind of just sounds the coolest and yeah you know I mean
00:41:08 the buster call in one piece it is in fact a phone call that is made yeah five admiral five
00:41:13 vice admirals and they come in and they bust the place up with cannons and stuff so okay understandable
00:41:20 gun but you know I think there is a reason why I don't know about gun buster I think that one was
00:41:24 just called that because it was cool I think die buster has a meaning but I forget what it is I
00:41:30 think I looked it up one time it's when you get shot with a gun you die right isn't a die butsu
00:41:36 the like buda statue yes it is like diamonds die means great oh my god that's obviously what it is
00:41:42 why am I a fucking idiot yes that's okay I don't know that for sure but die does mean big so it's
00:41:49 just the it's really big I think I think it's just a sort of anglicization of them calling it the die
00:41:55 buster as in the great buster or whatever like a bigger version I will give a slight my suspicion
00:42:01 sure sure while gun buster being called gun buster is wholly appropriate and makes every
00:42:06 totally makes sense and it's thematically you know obviously the right way I don't know about
00:42:10 like it still seems random it still seems like they just picked a word oh well I put on the front
00:42:15 that's not like the show is about guns well no no I mean it's a robot that is the most important
00:42:22 robot ever that happens to be called gun buster so it makes sense yes they should know why but why
00:42:28 is it called run buster why that name it doesn't bust guns I don't know it has a gun and it busts
00:42:35 it's not it's not a critique of when I think about both things when I think about the gun buster the
00:42:41 titular gun buster yeah what I imagine it doing I would not describe as busting per se I don't know
00:42:48 does make you feel good though all I'm yeah true all I'm saying is I would be interested to perhaps see
00:42:54 like a like a breakdown maybe or maybe a list of like usage of that word in anime and see if there's
00:43:00 like some sort of like genesis point where like it started just comes from ghost busters that maybe
00:43:06 just come from fucking ghost busters maybe maybe but I bet you could at least get Amino to comment
00:43:12 on where he assuming he's the one who came up with the name um I there's some information about
00:43:18 that somewhere yeah please do um but I was gonna say I have always thought that while ghost ghost
00:43:24 buster was 1984 gun buster was 1988 88 okay that's plenty of time that's plenty of time for uh you
00:43:30 know you know I thinking about it that is the obvious answer isn't it like the the phrase the word
00:43:37 buster surely like it ghost busters must be the thing oh and of course we should forget
00:43:44 the actual Japanese name of the show is aim for the top gun buster uh or is it just aim for the top
00:43:50 I can't remember aim for maybe maybe they maybe means aim for the top gun buster I either way
00:43:56 in Japanese the robot is still called the gun buster yes certainly true certainly true I was
00:44:01 gonna say I've always thought the the the second show is called die buster I don't even know if
00:44:06 they say the word die buster in the show I think they definitely don't they don't okay and you just
00:44:12 watched it uh they so they don't even say well I don't think so I couldn't infer okay there's no
00:44:18 there's no robot called the die buster I well I think the die buster is the really big Noriko
00:44:24 mech that shows up in the last episode to do oh that stuff I pretty sure that's the die buster
00:44:30 you know what I think you're right right and I'm wrong and that is like the great version the die
00:44:35 version of the gun buster is this ultimate you know conglomerate and that's fine and that's
00:44:42 fine I'm just gonna say I just wanted to say I always wanted to say about that that in gun buster
00:44:47 gun buster is central to like everything that happens so that's cool die buster sure in the
00:44:51 final battle it's relevant it should have been called like I don't know no no gun buster because
00:44:56 it's all about no no no no is so much more important than the die buster itself and it always seemed
00:45:03 stupid and dumb I mean I think they probably use the name for name recognition I'm sure I mean
00:45:10 you're right it's the die the top two aka die buster which is the bigger one I think you could
00:45:16 make a case that the gun buster is not really that central to the story of gun I mean it's there
00:45:23 well hey every every story is just about men in conflict with himself no so sure yeah it's true
00:45:28 that the die buster only appears in like one episode mm-hmm and was gay doesn't even look cool
00:45:34 who gives a shit the other men are so much cooler in die buster but the gun buster the gun there's
00:45:38 not really anything special about the gun like all it is is just a bigger robot basically yes that
00:45:43 just is better at fighting the aliens that the other robots were less good at fighting what can
00:45:48 episode two of the buster cast everybody and also also I think it is actually made up of many little
00:45:54 buster machines as I recall which I think I think all those little guys the die buster yeah yeah yeah
00:46:02 yeah yeah yeah the die buster is it's made up of the um the like planetary defense robots which I think
00:46:08 are buster machines because that is a specific thing in I believe they no they are maybe collectively
00:46:13 they are one buster machine together yes they are all they are all part of um gun buster number seven
00:46:19 which which is no no no no no is buster number seven and all of those planetary defense like
00:46:24 droids are like a part of her oh you're making me I mean I do wish I had kind of spent the time to
00:46:30 watch the show if for no other reason now I have not to be on the buster cast just to re-experience
00:46:34 one of the greatest anime ever made die buster it's so good hey guys they are unbelievably good
00:46:40 hey audience if you want to hear more about die buster gun buster go listen to the buster cast
00:46:44 it's me and Tom we got a lot of things wrong uh you can get mad like I said I said in it that I
00:46:50 thought that it was um Anna was first to directorial role which is wrong oh yeah they're enough oh my
00:46:56 god remember I think it's episode three of die buster where uh like the girl the mean girl with
00:47:02 the blue hair has her little arc and she gets the buster and no no selfishly gives up her buster
00:47:07 machine so that that girl can pilot one instead and she fucking does that amazing like negative
00:47:12 170 trillion like ice beam blast or whatever yes it makes it makes it snow on uh on the music
00:47:20 plays oh the fucking ending theme song that plays as that shit goes down oh god it's so good it's the
00:47:25 best show ever made groovy magic groovy magic is the greatest opening of all time except for it is
00:47:32 gurren logins but that's me hype every friggin time you know what's funny when I when I first
00:47:37 met Michelle and we were talking about anime and stuff and I was just like hey you know this one
00:47:40 grooving magic and Michelle's like I know this one and I was like whoa you've seen die buster
00:47:45 she's like no I was like what what she had like heard it on like Japanese radio or like Hawaiian
00:47:51 radio or some stupid normie shit well that if you live in Hawaii I guess you hear more of I'm a
00:47:56 little surprised but I'm glad round table is a popular group I guess it's a good song and it does
00:48:01 so so oh was it not made for the show I believe that it was but uh I assume it also made the rounds
00:48:08 elsewhere I guess why wouldn't you know I don't know if it's a good song yeah and it was a good song
00:48:15 god that's not so fucking fuck yeah I don't know all right well there you go anything else to say
00:48:21 about gun buster um I love it it's good obviously the ending of gun buster is kind of like the most
00:48:26 amazing thing that's ever happened in the history of anime but overall I'm saying it again I like
00:48:30 die buster we talked we talked about it I like the ending of die buster better because of how it
00:48:36 relates to the yeah because that's certainly understandable it is when you when you realize
00:48:41 the connection you go whoa it's just it's that other thing I you know couldn't agree more oh but
00:48:47 that ending of gun buster is so legendary because it is you know it is it is damn I mean die buster
00:48:53 would be nothing without gun but it wouldn't be nothing at the end of die buster after all the
00:48:59 sacrifice uh I forget like lark lark is gonna be there to continue the legacy and to do the thing
00:49:04 that no no always wanted to do but you didn't get the chance she didn't get the chance he's gonna
00:49:11 help her live her legacy oh god buster it's too good hey cool it I'm sorry oh are you excited for
00:49:19 uh uh aim for the top three big buster I can't wait David buster please call it big buster right
00:49:27 buster the last thing I want to say about die buster is it is weird how much it is just fully
00:49:33 cooly sometimes yes it is like sometimes it just looks exactly like fully cool like they just
00:49:38 like it's almost like they traced it it's almost like sometimes they just traced scenes from fully
00:49:42 cooly and put new characters in them I believe it was made I want to say two years after fully
00:49:47 cooly if I remember correct yeah something like that I think it was like 2002 it looks it looks and
00:49:51 feels very similar a lot of the time which for me is great right it's awesome I love that yeah it's
00:49:57 great it's a it's probably a better sequel to fully cooly than the fully cooly sequels are
00:50:03 have you watched either of those which I have not seen them now then I'm sure that you that is
00:50:06 true uh I have no doubt everybody hates them I don't want to watch them I have not seen them but
00:50:14 I'm not interested um by the way that wasn't a joke aim for the top three was announced to be
00:50:20 worked on uh a while ago I don't know if you were aware of that uh no they but the weird it is
00:50:26 absolutely in developer hell it was announced like several years ago and there has been exactly
00:50:32 zero updates since that time so I I hope they literally just let it go and they just don't do
00:50:37 it um let it maybe maybe let it die let it die hard to imagine them improving on what they've
00:50:45 already got you know what they'd fucking do they'd fucking bring in the like your name guy or you
00:50:50 know whatever that and they have that guy do his vision no is that you yeah yeah that's my
00:50:55 masaki usa I believe I think um I don't know you're so good everything he does is great guys
00:51:02 that's like letting nomura direct funnel fancy seven again wasn't that a great idea I mean it was
00:51:06 part of the original team how what could go wrong isn't masaki usa really good or you think it's
00:51:10 someone else wait I'm thinking of the wrong person wait masaki is the pink one guy uh and yeah he did
00:51:17 that yeah okay fuck you guys know he's like the most popular anime man right now whatever the
00:51:23 fuck his name is your name uh yeah garden words I think uh Garfield this is Garfield yeah Jim Davis
00:51:31 right yeah um love him Jimu Davis hey I'm sorry did I tell you guys I might have already said this
00:51:38 did I tell you my discovery that uh in reading the most recent one piece SPS it turns out that
00:51:44 Neko Mamushi the big cat his favorite food is lasagna uh no it's it's canon yeah that's true
00:51:51 that's amazing it's obviously a Garfield reference and like the other the dog Inu Inu Arashi
00:51:58 Inu Arashi loves bones which isn't odyspecific but based on his ear shape and his general coloring
00:52:03 I think it's fair to say they are inspired by Garfield so wait wait hang on does that mean like
00:52:10 who who is who is um who is what's Odin or uh Momonosuke no no the uh what's the guy's guy's
00:52:18 name in Gar Garfield the John John who is John it's gotta be is that oh guys from the guys from
00:52:25 the animal island from the elephant that's right yeah that's right oh god who's the John who's the
00:52:31 John to these guys I guess Odin it's gotta be Odin it's gotta be Odin now where could my sword be
00:52:38 you haven't met him yet he shows been one but he's Momonosuke's dad um okay yeah he's like
00:52:44 he got a flashback with him later and stuff we always he's like he's like the old king or
00:52:48 something who was like he was the old emperor he was not the shogun but he's like the old ruler
00:52:54 who was like too nice and wanted to open his borders yeah yeah that's correct that's something
00:52:58 happened I don't he got assassinated or something yeah he was killed yeah yeah yeah you spoiled it
00:53:04 but we we already know that god damn it that's that's ancient ass history that's set up for the
00:53:09 one or it is did you know Japan exists what I hate that Ben have you you've seen big mom's
00:53:16 flashback already right Odin is just Odin is just Bernie Sanders and like Bernie gets buried
00:53:23 because he's too good but he was too good for this world that does happen to him basically
00:53:29 but uh what was I gonna say oh all right you so you already saw uh big mom's flashback of course
00:53:34 during during hulking out and whatnot but did you also Ben get the same sense of
00:53:39 what the fuck is that when for exactly one panel okay there's a there's a lot of things I think we
00:53:44 did talk about like she ate her friends no no no there's that which is amazing but not right now
00:53:51 do I want to talk about that I want to talk about how uh big mom was on Elba is where her
00:53:57 like orphanage was and for exactly one panel you can see that there's like an island there and you
00:54:03 sit at the house but directly to the right there is some sort of gigantic mountain or cliff face
00:54:10 or something that looks bigger than like anything we've seen in the entire series thus far and I
00:54:16 want to know what the fuck that thing is do you have Elba I don't yeah you're gonna have to show me
00:54:21 a screenshot or something Elba island let me see I bet it did read this part but I don't remember
00:54:29 yeah okay here boom from the anime I gotta fucking catch it I'm only like 40 chapters behind
00:54:34 I gotta just catch up make like a tomato yeah look at this there's like the ship pulling up
00:54:39 that you can see the house and just for size comparison you can see that is a giant mountain
00:54:44 and then there's that thing oh my god yeah what is that is that yiggers soul is that what that would
00:54:51 be maybe maybe it is the world tree or like Adam tree maybe oh yeah so that is that is Elba right
00:55:01 this is yes this has stayed to be on Elba this is the only image we've like ever seen of it
00:55:06 shit maybe that is a tree it doesn't look like bark oh yeah you know in the in the manga it's a bit
00:55:12 more obvious that it's probably a tree oh my god that that it sort of goes outwards I never noticed
00:55:18 that going outward until right now shit that probably is a tree cool it it looks like it might be
00:55:25 a tree I don't know is there supposed to be like some kind of super tree I mean I feel like with
00:55:30 Elba is Norse and we all know Norse mythology has yiggers ill the world tree and whatnot so
00:55:36 damn sounds I just learned that at this very moment how godmother caramel was incredibly
00:55:40 hot when she was young and had like an amazing arc with big mom wait awesome you know mother
00:55:46 caramel oh oh caramel yes yeah yeah yeah yeah she smoked that was sick good stuff hey smoke she
00:55:52 someone updates that old image someone update that old image of all the smokers in one piece
00:55:58 and please put mother carabelle as a young hot self on that smoking looks so cool it sure does
00:56:04 like in manga and stuff it sure does fucking base spike spiegel got me got me on the train
00:56:10 back in the day cool base um let me see uh was that gonna bring up something else there was a smoke
00:56:16 that like burned for the same amount of time and looked exactly the same and was not bad for you
00:56:22 like could could that not be fabricated ben ben takes a hit of his vape damn if only there
00:56:29 were something like that no that's that's a metal thing I want to like a piece of paper that could
00:56:34 light like half of the coolness of the cigarette is the burning you need the fire there you need
00:56:39 the lighter you can get the vapor at least when you exhale which is uh which is something I suppose
00:56:44 it's it's a different flavor it's a different feeling it's certainly cool in its own way but
00:56:49 it's not one is far more so do you want to go for like the cowboy cowboy bebop jazz aesthetic or do
00:56:54 you want to go for like the techno futurey uh you know vape I like I like the jazz you want to
00:57:00 look like a bounty hunter from the future you go with the vape indeed that's true that's true
00:57:05 hmm but the real cool guys just use a lighter on their vape they burn it down every time
00:57:12 hey uh I just wanted to say in my ongoing struggle uh between the duality of man lexical and
00:57:18 impressionism um I've been uh watching factorial speed runs there is nothing in this world more
00:57:26 like a fucking spreadsheet uh or like lexically minded than a factorial speed run I I'm I'm not
00:57:34 sure it's like lexical because like lexical you're right I'm using the word very loose it's definitely
00:57:39 linear there's there's either the the lateral or the linear I think factorial might be more of a
00:57:46 lateral thing because you have to think of so many steps ahead um I know it shouldn't be the most
00:57:51 efficient well the way that I think it's it probably just boils down to math at the end of
00:57:57 the day there's probably just like a mathematically optimal ladies and gentlemen ben and gib I invite
00:58:02 you to enjoy this experience with me one of these days on this factorial speed run quest and the thing
00:58:09 is this man uh shout out to my boy nephrums the current world record holder for both any percent
00:58:16 and 100 completion on factorial speed runs um he's down to sub two hours now baby I want to be
00:58:23 the summoning salt to make the fucking legacy of the my boy nephrums killing the game at factorial
00:58:30 how many how many views does this have like this is this one is the world record 10 000 the guys
00:58:35 got only less than five k subs but like this is what he does my favorite thing and not my favorite
00:58:40 thing but something I really like is when I watch like a summoning salt video he'll talk about like
00:58:45 these people who are like these people that like loom large in the speed running can be like this
00:58:48 person like basically invented the way it's like everybody knows this guy this guy's like a legendary
00:58:53 speedrunner he'll show like a screenshot of his youtube channel it's like no avatar 2.5 k subs
00:58:59 are you like 700 subs I kind of love it's got it's got a real like like um like secret like um uh
00:59:07 what's the word it's a certain type of aesthetic that's sort of obscure but like you know you walk
00:59:13 into a bar and like there's people that you don't know are like super genius badasses in their
00:59:18 community and you're just sort of like oh i'm stupid I don't know and then and then later you
00:59:22 realize and you're like I was talking to that guy that's true every human is a is a a series of
00:59:29 mysteries and accomplishments that you can't know so like like this this video like revolutionized
00:59:35 the uh the the mario sunshine speedrunning community he shows a screenshot it's got like
00:59:40 150 views yes but but to the people who care it's like such a big deal I mean how many people go
00:59:46 and read those like uh like I don't know you got like a youtube uh video by someone like a million
00:59:51 subs like a news guy about like how you know like youtube has just changed its policy and it's gonna
00:59:57 ruin everybody uh you know whatever no no no I don't give a shit if that's true or not but he
01:00:01 makes a video like that and then like the actual like document that youtube published about this
01:00:06 will have like 100 views like like barely anybody actually read the source material
01:00:10 which of course is how it works and I understand why you know you know what's cool about it it's
01:00:14 it's like um it gives validity to it like like the story is real because nobody knows about this
01:00:21 thing like imagine yeah imagine how boring and lame it would be um if somebody was talking about like
01:00:26 the most influential song of an age and then they link to gangnam style it's like yeah yeah yeah
01:00:32 everyone's heard of that that's a big song who cares it's it's not special I think I think it's a
01:00:39 lot of um I don't know but thinking about when it comes to like the ff7 remake and whatnot I've
01:00:43 been thinking a lot about and I think I'm definitely going to address this in some way like uh what do
01:00:48 people really mean by soul versus soulless and whatnot and in short what the fuck are you talking
01:00:54 about these are common terms these are common terminology that's used to describe like old
01:00:59 versus new games and how people feel about them and why they feel like something is weird and
01:01:03 different about about new game styles and I what it really comes down to the short version is like
01:01:09 when for example in final fantasy seven the original they had these blocky models and like every
01:01:15 everything they did like every unique okay here's a here's a perfect uh uh idea of what soul is for
01:01:22 specifically only the final battle of cloud versus sephiroth at the very end where it's like the
01:01:28 battle within clouds mind to rid himself of the final traces of sephiroth where it's got super
01:01:33 sexy shirtless sephiroth and he does omni slash even if you haven't learned the limit oh my god
01:01:38 like the most kino battle of all time for that specific battle they made updated new better
01:01:45 looking 3d models of both cloud and sephiroth just for that one battle because they knew that they
01:01:52 wanted to like focus and more on of them have like cinematic camera angles and stuff happen there
01:01:57 like that is pure soul the effort they put in to like enhance that experience uh you know like for
01:02:04 the viewing public and stuff by doing extra work or like in an old like 8-bit game or a 16-bit
01:02:10 adding extra sprites just for like one little scene that the developers want to do all that
01:02:16 feels like soul as opposed to what feels soulless by comparison is just for example I think most
01:02:22 people would agree on this in ff7 remake you got a lot of characters who have like little
01:02:27 little side stories little arcs they're doing on the side and little like side missions you got to
01:02:31 do but the thing is all those characters look like generic fallout wastelanders who are just like
01:02:38 they look like unity assets that have just been imported and they do not feel special or unique
01:02:42 especially in comparison to like the main crew which are very colorful and beautiful yeah um
01:02:48 that distinction is really clear in stuff like that I think I think with things like
01:02:52 that it's like the the decision to make a whole model is a big deal because of how much I mean
01:02:59 Final Fantasy was already on three discs um yep there's so much space required to do those things
01:03:06 but like nowadays the the hardware limitations basically don't exist you can do it right in
01:03:11 anything the graphical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 are phenomenal and um games can
01:03:17 look incredible and there's like there's almost no excuse for not having everything
01:03:24 possible yes yeah and so like we feel that we feel that I think it just sort of feels
01:03:30 and it's like an unfortunate it it's impossible for something to feel
01:03:34 soulful because you can't you can't get a sense of how hard they're working to make something
01:03:40 happen I think it's nobody's fault but I think that kind of is the reality yeah what I thought
01:03:44 you were gonna say Nate was like okay so like yeah they made these updated like higher res models
01:03:48 just for this one moment so you get this moment of like whoa we've ramped it up but like yeah on
01:03:54 like a new like a triple A game or whatever like everything is fully rendered everything is like
01:04:00 fully realized and fleshed out because the budget is enormous you know they're they do that with
01:04:04 everything so there's no like moment wherein you go oh whoa they really they ramped it up for this one
01:04:09 what it's all because it's because the fucking processors are blasting it 100% all the time
01:04:14 I think when people say soul I think what like when I think of what that term means really it's like
01:04:20 I'm playing this game and I when I see something like I'm playing Final Fantasy 6 or something I
01:04:24 don't know and I see the like the sprite of Terra like there's that one famous sprite of Terra
01:04:29 going like blah and like kind of like spazzing out like in like embarrassment or surprise
01:04:34 or something like that and sure that that gets used a bunch but like they could have
01:04:40 done something far simpler you know what that's actually a bad example but what I'm trying to
01:04:43 convey is the the emotion of feeling the developer like despite all the limitations that existed for
01:04:49 them in the context they were making it you can feel them going above and beyond and the problem
01:04:54 is exactly what you were saying the context these days has changed where it now just feels it like
01:05:00 there is an expectation that everything will it look at least a certain level of quality and a
01:05:05 certain level of amazingness and stuff so um yeah I mean I mean there's still like potential for that
01:05:12 feeling if you know that the person is an indie developer and they make something oh yeah no doubt
01:05:17 so like I absolutely do you think do you think large budget triple a big things are impossible
01:05:23 to feel soulful I would say it's it's gonna be way harder it's not impossible but yeah what would it
01:05:29 take is the question art from adversity and a triple a budget a triple a title with a triple a
01:05:34 budget faces less adversity you know what I mean that's definitely true I don't know I'm trying to
01:05:39 think of an example of something I have played oh I got it I got it I know exactly what it is or
01:05:44 this is one example love like Dark Souls 3 and that's like a you know I love that game too it's a
01:05:50 triple a game is so much it looks beautiful and it's like a lot of soul like would that you know
01:05:55 I don't think I would I would argue that have you seen it have you seen that Matthew Matosa's
01:05:59 video where he talks about the lost souls how about that he talks talks about one is the one
01:06:04 people generally think is is the most soulful and I guess at the time you could say that I was a triple a
01:06:12 it wasn't a triple a it was it was gone the cusp they were like they had a they had a success in
01:06:18 Demon Souls and they that was the first actually big game Dark Souls I think a lot of it was that
01:06:23 like expectations really were like low like Dark Souls is where things really exploded and like
01:06:29 that game for many reasons that maybe people have made a million video essays about no one expected
01:06:33 that game to have as much like depth and I don't know cool game design stuff going on so that's
01:06:40 not exactly soul but it was just like good and like soul soul would be for example in Dark Souls
01:06:47 the fact that Ash Lake even exists in as hidden a place as this you know what that shows me that
01:06:53 shows me those developers were willing to make an entire huge awesome section of the game they're
01:07:00 willing to make it sculpted populated with characters unique NPCs an entire like the dragon
01:07:05 quest line or whatever they were willing to say you know what many characters are just many players
01:07:10 are just not going to find this and you know we're okay with that we don't need everything we've done
01:07:15 to be thrust in the face of every developer of every player and we were comfortable with that
01:07:19 because we're confident that the game will be better for this being a mystery for many players
01:07:24 because mystery was a big important part of much of Dark Souls early life it's it's better when
01:07:29 yeah there's things that not everyone even even knowing what it is before you play it for the
01:07:34 first time because I the first time I experienced Dark Souls was watching the digi bros play through
01:07:41 and so I learned about Ash Lake through them doing it talking about and playing it and even
01:07:46 knowing that it was there it still feels incredible to go there it does it really does just the just
01:07:53 the fact that you know the knowledge that the developers put it in there and didn't tell anyone
01:07:58 just because the knowledge is now out doesn't mean that that that is different and so it still
01:08:02 feels soulful in that way knowledge of the context is important and I think we're all pretty I think
01:08:08 we're all pretty aware of that but by the way a modern to be fair a modern example of modern day
01:08:12 soul easy one like okay this isn't this isn't the most soulful thing ever because as you'll see
01:08:18 like you have to pay extra money for it and like the game itself was lacking in many ways but
01:08:24 the remind dlc of kingdom arts 3 much of the dlc has horrible cutscenes the final fantasy characters
01:08:29 are shitty but the boss fights themselves are soulful as hell most of them not not all of them
01:08:36 are amazing the the my favorite part so far the marluxia data battle fight in kingdom arts 3
01:08:44 is so fucking soulful uh it's got all these references to like old marluxia fights throughout
01:08:52 history it's got this new remix of the fucking lord of the castle theme from uh chain of memories
01:08:59 that fight is so good and I I just love replaying it because it not only is it is a challenging
01:09:05 gameplay experience I just feel like saturated in the classic kingdom art stuff that I love
01:09:11 while being challenged by the game I I cannot get enough of it it's so good uh but and you can
01:09:17 contrast that with other fights that I feel in the data you know remind ones that are
01:09:21 significantly less soulful faithfully recreated a lot of the time but unfortunately recreated
01:09:26 from games that aren't as good you've given examples yeah what could you define in words
01:09:33 the what it means to have soul in a game yes it's kind of it's kind of a calculation I would
01:09:40 argue it's like effort put in like extra effort beyond what would be just the bare bones need
01:09:47 to like convey the idea across like over like technical limitations that existed at the time
01:09:53 so like everything's going to be like a degree of how much it is relative to like the context it
01:09:58 was in what technology was available and like your your savvy gamer should or you know consumer of
01:10:03 any media should be able to tell uh like what was there you know this reminds me of someone in my
01:10:08 stream yesterday said this was a Sam Hyde quote uh I don't know from what and I would actually love
01:10:13 to find it if anybody knows but it was just something like when developers in the old days
01:10:17 or when when like artists only had oil paints to paint with they like weren't distracted by
01:10:24 I don't know like fan expectations okay maybe that wasn't quite true but like miscellaneous stuff
01:10:29 they had they had their they had their patrons they had their rich Italian family they did they
01:10:33 didn't have to please those people but please the king or whatever they weren't distracted by
01:10:38 things like you know I don't know like should I put like a QTE in to that would break up the flow
01:10:44 of this segment of the game here I don't know just like an example of they had very limited tools
01:10:49 so it had to stand on just how good is your oil painting technique whereas with modern games I would
01:10:55 just argue that there's tons of things that you can put in as a distraction and I don't think
01:11:00 distractions from like the main pieces of the game aren't are always a good idea FF7 original had
01:11:06 tons of minigames but those minigames given the context of the time and place felt insanely soulful
01:11:13 out of nowhere in Final Fantasy 7 you're suddenly on a motorcycle chase that was like inconceivable
01:11:18 that would be in a game of this type at that's out of nowhere you're doing a fucking snowboarding
01:11:22 mission which is like my favorite part of the fucking game that you're just snowboarding out of
01:11:26 nowhere that's soul and it's all about the time and you can play him again in the gold saucer yeah
01:11:32 you can it's amazing it's amazing all right given that then I think something that would be a triple
01:11:37 a soulful experience yeah would be for a game to not have tons of miscellaneous side quests
01:11:44 and for it to be relatively short and sweet and good all the way through
01:11:49 that would be that would be a thing that is like a bad monetary decision you want your game to last
01:11:54 for 50 60 70 hours and you have what you want it to have like tons of collectibles that don't mean
01:11:59 anything tons of side characters that don't mean anything that don't have any like rich
01:12:03 character they just sort of say a few lines and they have a like please do this for me
01:12:08 like a game that comes out in the modern day that doesn't have all of the bullshit things that
01:12:13 modern games are expected to have would be a soulful moment I would respect that in a game yeah
01:12:17 yeah and you know like really tightly focused on you know telling the story I can imagine in my head
01:12:24 like if they were ff7 suffers from this to a degree the remake does but like for example
01:12:28 chrono trigger amazing game one of the greatest rpgs ever made that game is packed to the gills
01:12:35 with side quests but all those side quests are insanely soulful look I mean some are better
01:12:41 than others but like the fact like that game is basically modular you decide at what point you
01:12:47 want to fight lavos you decide how many party members you want to do it with you can even
01:12:51 decide if you want to ff7 revive chrono when he ff7 dies those side quests are insanely soulful
01:12:58 because they all tie directly into the plot give you components that like make the game
01:13:04 like you get like frogs final weapon they tangibly improve your experience of the game
01:13:09 they play with the main mechanics of the game and they do not feel like a waste of time because the
01:13:15 whole game is set up such that you are in control of time travel so like doing side missions would
01:13:20 not interrupt like anything you're doing I suppose it could have a few I think it's just like there's
01:13:25 a balance to strike where as soon as you feel like something could be copy pasted like a character
01:13:32 model or you know a mission seems very similar to another one and the rewards are like you know
01:13:41 crafting materials as opposed to like interesting story progression and you know things that move
01:13:48 the main story forward yep as long as it feels like I don't know it's hard to it's hard to figure
01:13:56 out exactly where that balance would be that's that's true and you know here's another soulful
01:14:00 moment just of history uh yes this was there they were a big studio very successful at this point
01:14:05 but but simply Square Enix putting in the entire opera scene from Final Fantasy 6 giving sellies
01:14:12 like the Maria costume like a full new sprite sheet set and making her like sing like this was
01:14:17 revolutionary this has never been done before and like a sprite based game insanely soulful in
01:14:23 off the chart soul in that whole section which is why it's regarded as like one of the most amazing
01:14:27 moments of all time but I mean now like if you just separate context you can look back in Final
01:14:34 Fantasy 6 and be like eh graphics aren't even that good man graphics like okay yes sure they're not
01:14:39 even that good because it was made like 20 fucking years ago or like 25 years ago more than that yeah
01:14:44 yeah almost 30 I think at this point and um it's like you gotta keep a lot of people these days
01:14:52 really seem to want to strip context out of everything and I think that's a bad I especially
01:14:57 there's a lot of people who want to defend the remake and I understand there are perfectly valid
01:15:02 remake like reasons to defend the remake on all kinds of points I would simply want them to just
01:15:07 remember the context of the original I think it's important and when you've got a remake you cannot
01:15:12 avoid being latched to the original because you call it a remake you didn't call it Final Fantasy 7
01:15:18 2 or anything like that you call it a remake and where does a bunch of meetings but okay I don't
01:15:22 want to get a whole thing about about the remake but hey Nate did you see my video about Final Fantasy
01:15:27 7 thoughts I did I did um forgive me I forget exactly what you said you want you want to recap
01:15:32 it for me real quick no I forget what exactly what I said as well it doesn't matter I remember
01:15:36 that there were some things that slightly disagreed with my opinion and that made me insanely angry
01:15:41 as all opinions that don't 100% adhere with mine do uh I'm exaggerating I think I had some
01:15:47 slight differences but I think your point was overall I think my point was like
01:15:55 you know there's always this this idea that the original you know needs to be preserved because
01:16:03 it's good and I want it to be something that other people in the future can play and a remake
01:16:10 sometimes at the argument not necessarily the argument you make is that it can obfuscate the
01:16:18 original by being the one that people play instead and if it's slightly wrong then that's
01:16:24 unfortunate because the better experience is being lost and not everyone's gonna play the original
01:16:29 and it's it's it's it's unfortunate and I was just thinking like could it even be is is the idea that
01:16:37 you could play Final Fantasy 7 today even feasible and still enjoy it in the same way and that was
01:16:43 just sort of like a thought process thing that is that's a good question I would emphatically
01:16:49 argue the answer that question is 100 yes uh but some people might disagree um yeah it's really
01:16:56 just sort of raising the point that like yeah there are a lot of more there are a lot more context
01:17:01 things that go into the enjoyment of anything um like the year it came out compared to all the
01:17:07 other things that were coming out how many how much revolutionary it is doesn't matter anymore because
01:17:12 things have come out since and now those moments aren't going to be as mind-blowing
01:17:17 to people who are experiencing it so it's like it's going to be a different experience no matter
01:17:21 what you do well that's true I would definitely say that like Final Fantasy 7 is a great game
01:17:26 to play now because I played it not too long ago for the first time and it was good yeah yeah uh
01:17:32 yeah I mean if you can do that I would argue a lot of people can too by the way my favorite thing
01:17:35 about that video by far is your artwork uh uh on the the main thumbnail everyone should go
01:17:40 look at it why is why is Tifa so hot it's just how it is man look at her uh oh I really like
01:17:46 your tron I gotta call the ethics department those bazoingas are are offending me they're far too
01:17:51 large but I like that's it that's what I like about them yeah I was just I was just sort of
01:17:58 scribbling doodling I drew the cloud and I was like haha it is great you know what I like how you
01:18:04 are um erasing the only um person of color in the cast by putting him in the bottom right corner
01:18:09 where the timer will appear directly I didn't realize that I was like oh shit thanks man I don't
01:18:14 know about you guys literally like a sense of bar over his mouth the time I feel it's great I feel
01:18:19 so happy uh that I have acquired an infinite supply of of end passes and word passes because
01:18:26 I love barrett so much a proud black man because I have such a deep bond with barrett if he were here
01:18:32 he would give you the n word pass I know he would I know he would thank you barrett and you got you
01:18:38 guys would fist bump yeah um and he would I don't know he would say nah brah sol good he would that's
01:18:47 just what he would say in my mind that's how it would go that's the greatest character ever
01:18:52 conceived in history man barrett might be the best character in final fantasy seven uh in terms of
01:18:57 how happy he makes my pp oh my god when him and more leaner together I feel like I feel like I
01:19:03 feel like discussion about the remake has largely has like a lot of it's been focused on barrett and
01:19:08 like I guess I forgot I don't remember a lot of people like I don't remember barrett being a lot
01:19:12 of people's favorite character but I hear a lot of people saying that they like the remake say like
01:19:17 oh barrett's so good I hear that the white women have been going gaga for this guy uh is that true
01:19:23 I don't know I did see some article or some like Twitter post about I don't have have I ever told you
01:19:29 the first time like when I played final fantasy seven yeah the first time for like that g rpj
01:19:34 by the way I'm right with you white women I'm one of you I'm yeah um that uh I did like I didn't know
01:19:40 all of the like different things you do to get like uh things to happen like yufi I didn't know
01:19:46 how to make her appear oh yeah yeah um script so I have to look at look at that shit up you got to
01:19:50 go on game fat yeah man you gotta print out 50 fucking pages on your mom's printer staple it together
01:19:56 keep it next to your console fuck yeah dude I I didn't want to try that um uh just because I wanted
01:20:02 to see what would happen and I ended up with barrett in the date scene oh fuck yeah you got the best
01:20:07 arc man that's the best part it up although to be fair I was thinking like oh wait why is barrett
01:20:13 here what is going on like and when people were talking to eris and tiva the entire time intentionally
01:20:19 I guess I did I like didn't know what it was funny because like because they go on that thing I didn't
01:20:25 even know there was a quote unquote date scene yeah and people were talking about I was like what do
01:20:29 you mean I just went on a ride with barrett at some point that's why just railroading everyone
01:20:33 down the exact same experiences gay as hell and fucking different stories and different shit
01:20:38 give you shit to talk about it's fun it's cool it's soul is what it is it's soul dating barrett
01:20:45 is the peak soul you think you think in remake part two they're gonna allow you to date anyone
01:20:51 except eris I would bet a thousand fucking dollars that they force you to date eris and no one else
01:20:56 they're gonna let you I think they're gonna let you do that that that would I feel like that would
01:21:01 be like an like overt sort of like downgrade I think people would hate that here's here's what I
01:21:09 might do you guys money you want to put money down I'll do it I'll bet a hundred dollars they
01:21:13 force you to date specifically eris I will put money down all right hmm I don't want to put
01:21:20 down honestly dollars one hundred dollars I want to take that bet because I think you're wrong
01:21:25 but I would feel bad winning a hundred dollars yeah uh you want to do 10 I'll do I don't know
01:21:30 50 I will bet you ten dollars let's do um like like a hundred million slime coin how about that
01:21:36 I don't have any slime coin dammit I'm broke I will ten dollar all right you and me ban if you
01:21:41 want to do a give two ten dollars it's on the books I have like absolutely no dog in this race at all
01:21:48 sure but my my gut instinct is that that is an iconic scene from the original and for them to
01:21:55 and like it might just not do it I feel I feel like the mission statement of the remake is to pay
01:22:01 homage to the original and I agree that would be the opposite of that so I don't think they would
01:22:06 do that well you know I haven't actually done the research I believe see here's my evidence I believe
01:22:11 that they just removed now I need to test this but I think that they removed the option of
01:22:17 Don Corneo to date any to take any girl back it used to be eris tifa or cloud because I did it
01:22:23 and I got cloud I think that he will always pick cloud now I'm not sure I gotta double check that
01:22:28 because I get everyone the worst possible dress in the remake you can give him different dresses
01:22:32 and stuff uh so I'll double check that but I'm pretty sure that they already flattened that out
01:22:38 I mean I'll stick to the but I will take the bet the bet is there it is that there will be a scene
01:22:44 if not exactly a similar scene at like a similar point in the story and they will allow you to
01:22:50 there will be a variable option that includes Barrett and it will be a thing I think so I'll
01:22:57 give you buckaroos I will give you anything just like you don't need to define your position my
01:23:02 position is there will be a date you will be forced to date eris specifically if anything else happens
01:23:09 like if the date happens in any other format I will give you ten dollars I'm happy to take that bet
01:23:13 so what if there's if there's no date do I win yes you win you win well okay I mean that's just
01:23:18 stupid but I sure I mean I guess you win that too okay um um what if I think no one knows if that
01:23:24 that's true I think there will be a date it's too iconic there will be a date yeah no one wins if
01:23:29 there's no okay here's what I think will happen it won't I think there will be a choice but it will
01:23:34 be very obvious it won't be like cryptic like it was before they already do which might be like a
01:23:41 little bit like oh it's like just press the button go up to the person to talk to them and that's
01:23:46 obviously it will be this are you sure you want to initiate date with barrett are you sure you don't
01:23:51 want to save and and go and like grind friendship points with someone else first are you sure you
01:23:56 don't want to hit this button to just to just switch to options right now uh carefully careful
01:24:01 get on your back and go back and forth to build up friendship with barrett
01:24:07 leave dropping the daycare let them uh level up a few times they I'm sure they'll fuck around
01:24:12 with it but there will be some sort of like variable thing I need to google this can don
01:24:18 corneo pick eris ff7 remake I might have just been totally wrong about that wait wait um clown
01:24:29 if um clown stress hey so we were talking before about animal crossing and how I've
01:24:35 unlocked the I've I finally understand the true meta yes tell me it's now the time okay
01:24:40 so I've been grinding animal crossing water in my flowers breeding roses got got a good little
01:24:46 collection going yeah that's all cool but I have I have seen I have pierced the veil and seen the
01:24:52 code behind the matrix and I understand the true meta of how to win animal crossing and it is this
01:24:59 it's it's all about recipes hmm it is all about getting bells is about having more recipes because
01:25:06 and this this unlocked this unlocked the key to my potential right to my financial future
01:25:13 every recipe that you make every item that you craft sells for double the amount of
01:25:19 what you would have sold the ingredients for so the way to maximize your money is you have
01:25:25 enough ingredients that you can use as many of your resources as possible to craft items so what
01:25:31 I've been what I've been doing is I've just been waiting for a hot item that I know how to craft
01:25:35 and then just blowing all my iron and all my all my wood and all my clay and stone and stuff
01:25:40 just making as many of it as possible right right because that's because it's double the price of
01:25:44 the ingredients and then it's double the price of that because it's a hot item so you're quadrupling
01:25:49 your value on these raw materials that you got and that's it that's it it's it's you want to have
01:25:54 as many as many recipes as possible so that you can make full advantage of the most of your ingredients
01:25:59 like uh my friend Toby he's got a coconut recipe he's a palm tree lamp I'm jealous because I have
01:26:05 nothing I can do with these coconuts I'm selling at their base price wasted potential now however
01:26:10 apparently uh off like non-native fruit in terms of like how more native fruit sells for 100
01:26:20 non-native fruit sells for 500 but but a crafted recipe calculates the value as though it were
01:26:27 just a native fruit all fruit counts as native in terms of that so you actually do get more just
01:26:32 selling non-native fruit raw and not crafting it okay but native fruit like I've got apples I've
01:26:38 just every I've just been picking tons of apples crafting them into apple umbrellas I've just been
01:26:42 selling all my apple umbrellas yesterday uh uh the hot item was brick ovens and so it was clay
01:26:49 iron wood I just I just I had like stacks and stacks of clay I spent it all sold it all to
01:26:56 the nooks made like 100,000 bells um that's it not bad not bad get get recipes get recipes take
01:27:04 advantage of hot items uh a horde resources yep for the moment for the moment when when when it's
01:27:10 your time to shine you can use all those sticks and all those weeds or whatever yeah double your
01:27:15 shit I've done that once or twice uh a little bit doing the hot item thing I suspected that it was
01:27:21 the right way to go but uh good to have uh clarification on that it is it is it is the
01:27:26 thing if you're if you're um if you're playing by yourself the recipe will always be something
01:27:30 that you have unlocked uh I think because I'm not like the main islander like my friend Caleb
01:27:36 owns the switch so it's his game so I'm pretty sure it picks a recipe from things that he has
01:27:41 so sometimes it's something that I can't craft but other times it is something like like a
01:27:45 DIY table or something and it's okay I've been grinding wood now's the time got it got to spend
01:27:51 it all this is this is how to maximize its value oh man okay there you go I'm so close to my fourth
01:27:58 I'm so close to getting that second side room oh yeah I you know I now have I have a back room
01:28:04 and a left room in my house yeah yeah that's where I'm I'm almost at the right room I have like 100
01:28:11 I would have gotten it today but I decided to invest in turnips I spent about a hundred I invested
01:28:17 about a hundred thousand bells huh that's the real money right that's how you get it can be it
01:28:23 sometimes um I invested a hundred thousand bells in the turnips I because last week last week the
01:28:30 turnip price has just went down it was just a complete bust it was terrible it lost like half
01:28:35 your investment I didn't do it that week this week I'm counting on it being different I'm waiting
01:28:39 for it to peak around Wednesday Thursday fingers crossed and it'll all be worth it I don't have to
01:28:45 wait a little bit I have to wait a little bit on that house expansion but it'll all be worth it in
01:28:49 the end I've been trying to figure that out what uh how do I buy turnips I have not figured this
01:28:55 shit out on Sunday morning okay sometimes there is a little pig walking around who has a plate of
01:29:01 turnips on her head and she sells you the turnips okay okay it has it's like before like 10 a.m. or
01:29:07 like before noon Sunday so you can only buy Sunday but you can sell anytime you can buy on Sunday
01:29:14 you cannot sell them on Sunday you can sell them to the nooks on any other day right and the price
01:29:19 varies twice every at midnight and at noon the price changes so you got to check at least twice a day
01:29:25 if you won't really want to be on top of but if you wait until the next Sunday uh your turnips
01:29:29 all go bad so you have to sell them before Sunday or it's all wasted I see I see hey by the way I
01:29:35 was just trying to confirm this I do believe that Don Corneo always picks cloud in the remake I
01:29:41 have not found any evidence so that's lame that's bad news that's bad news for me it is that's bad
01:29:48 news for my bet prospects but I'm this is this is different though I'm aware this is a different
01:29:53 kind of situation but I'm seeing a flattening of choices across the board aka anti-soul and uh
01:30:00 anti-soul this anti-soul is being injected in just a moment like don't freak out people like
01:30:04 the remakes it's just one one little moment um uh but uh yeah okay so we'll we will see when part
01:30:10 two comes out in here's the joke guys 2045 give or take haha hey wow it'll be a long time I will
01:30:17 have forgotten by the bet by then oh I'm gonna write that one down commenters please remind us
01:30:22 we're counting on you the collective unconscious the the pcp episode 700 yeah seven seven seven
01:30:29 lucky it's a it's a lucky one final fantasy seven oh did you guys know that if it before before
01:30:37 uh well what were you gonna say I was just going to say video game speaking of soul did you guys
01:30:42 know that at any point in final fantasy seven if your hp ever hits for a character for any reason
01:30:49 healing taking damage 7777 exactly the character goes berserk and this never happened to me at
01:30:57 any time playing the game but it can be manipulated to do so um then uh you just do I believe 77
01:31:04 basic attacks in a row which kills almost anything in the game uh if it did know that I've never seen
01:31:11 it it's I mean god there's so much so in those games uh pretty pretty cool pretty cool funny
01:31:18 uh speaking of like doing like managing stuff and selling resources I've been playing slime
01:31:24 rauncher oh yeah there's another one hey and I'm I'm pretty far in uh I'm in the glass desert
01:31:31 I'm finding all the the special guys and I'm uh the slimes and the give give a quick question
01:31:36 about that uh my main thought about the game does that game have any played in a no I've never played
01:31:42 though watch you play a little bit you and munchie does that game have a satisfying arc where like
01:31:46 you grow resources which like unlocks new areas of the island to explore and then you kind of yes
01:31:52 basically all right sounds fine yeah it sounds fine yeah the the loop is pretty fun yeah and I
01:31:57 love that loop I've got to a point where I've got like drone bees uh that I can oh I love the drone
01:32:02 bees and so in in the main area I have uh all slimes that like fruit and their favorite fruit
01:32:10 growing so I have like one drone be give all of the slimes fruit and one of the others collect
01:32:16 the plots and sell them and so I have like hundreds of thousands of gold every time I
01:32:20 walk through them like hey yes the you have to you have you still have to like keep track of it
01:32:26 because you have to like water your yeah to water the water your drones or they get dehydrated and
01:32:32 they can't collect your shit which is silly because they're bees and also robots that like they
01:32:37 be double effect like weak to water you would think no they love it but they love splashing
01:32:43 with a bit of water and they wake up and they continue um and yeah I've been I've been uh
01:32:48 collecting all these things I mean it's just a fun game I got all I've never once I guess
01:32:54 I've been pretty careful I've never once had a calamity in my ranch and like all of like like
01:33:00 tar slimes have not appeared um it's happened to me I mean if you've got like a water the water
01:33:06 cannon it's not that hard to deal with uh tar slimes die pretty quick they do but like I've never
01:33:12 even I I don't usually like making Largo slimes I like having each slime like a bunch of them
01:33:20 small and you um you know like their own thing I had like a I wasn't sure for a while whether
01:33:27 because like a Largo slime gives two podrons lol a Largo slime gives two plorts when eats
01:33:34 um but but but you can fit more small slimes so like I think if you have like more resources
01:33:42 to feed them it's better to fill up a tank with small slimes but if you have fewer like like
01:33:47 crops and you want to get more out of them it's better to have Largo slimes this is like my
01:33:51 theory I don't know if there's like a spreadsheet about the things the thing with it is like if I
01:33:55 want to relocate I can't do the Largo slimes without extreme bullshit and with the smaller ones
01:34:02 if I need like oh um I want I wanted all the fruit enjoying because the the drone bees can
01:34:09 like deal with vegetables or fruits or specific things or like chickens um and and plorts and all
01:34:15 that um so I have all of like the vegetable slimes in one area all of the meat slimes in another
01:34:22 and so I I in order to make that happen you need I needed to transport like tons of slimes
01:34:29 and if they were Largo uh that would have you have to move them one at a time yeah would you be
01:34:34 in hell so um have you gotten to any of like the uh like bonus like end game content uh
01:34:43 like be like side farm areas that have like weird shit to do yeah yeah I've I've got to the guy
01:34:50 who is like uh he wants you to find the purple fruit I did all that I got to the point where I
01:34:56 have his ranch now so I have more space nice I've done I've been doing the uh the uh the glitch slime
01:35:03 simulations which are pretty fun I didn't find that for like a long time and like I got back into
01:35:08 the game for like just for for no reason after thinking I had done everything and then I found
01:35:13 that glitch slime area I was like what the fuck is this I just like didn't find it so baby it's um
01:35:22 have you done the quicksilver slime stuff yeah I've just started that it's uh that's pretty fun
01:35:27 it's pretty fun I I kind of didn't understand or what some of the things do I know you've got to
01:35:32 shoot the slimes and I'm trying to figure out like the best strategy for doing it yeah because it
01:35:38 seems like if you're running forwards and and the slimes are running ahead of you it's still hard
01:35:42 to hit them if you turn around though you can go like yeah you you run backwards and shoot at the
01:35:47 slimes coming at you that was mostly how I did and you use the like um I mean you can use like
01:35:52 the thunder shot to hit an area I liked using like the time slow area to like group up a bunch
01:35:57 together yeah I'm just like fire into the crowd that's a good game that's a good fucking game
01:36:03 it's just it's a lot of like it's management and running around and it's also cute yeah I really
01:36:10 like the sound effects there's a specific sound effect where like I think it's just some stock
01:36:14 thing but it reminds it's it's in an old game of like the the pc version of cluedo from 1998
01:36:21 um where it's like a click sound a very distinct click sound that sounds like somebody's switching
01:36:29 off a light but with like low bit rate or whatever like click click and and that's how you change
01:36:36 the items on your hotbar so it's like oh I just enjoy doing that I know that every uh whenever
01:36:42 you uh right click to I've said this before but in Metal Gear Solid 5 when you right click to like
01:36:47 aim a weapon the click click as you like put the weapon into position is so satisfying to me
01:36:52 I just love aiming my weapon it feels good so tactile holy artists sound effects engineers
01:36:59 based unsung heroes of video games you're right but by the way the so good when they're so good
01:37:06 it's true which is the only time I really remember this standing out to me was Metal Gear Solid 5
01:37:10 but the more I more I play games the more I'm aware of all this stuff by the way the uh quick
01:37:15 silver slime thing we're my sorry there's just this meme on 4chan where you know how metal slimes
01:37:20 will run away really fast in in dragon quest there's a uh no there's a meme I think it's metal
01:37:25 slimes there's a meme where you you have an image of a thing and when you click on an image in 4chan
01:37:28 you make it big uh actually the image is a gif and the metal slime is there for exactly one frame
01:37:34 and then it disappears and there's just an empty gif for the rest of the uh that's it because it
01:37:39 runs away really fast I love it every time I smile well I've got I've got voicemails if you guys
01:37:49 want to get to them um yeah if there's something else you want I'm trying to think about anything
01:37:56 else to say about animal crossing sure did you have images for a spend did you want to give us
01:38:00 your your flag which I wanted to see your panini yeah I will put them in the I will yeah because my
01:38:05 island is yakitori island yeah and a yakitori is like cooked is like a chicken I want to see flower
01:38:11 updates garden picks I will show pictures of my how my how my hey somebody write a jingle somebody
01:38:18 write a jingle for uh Ben's rose garden update or whatever it'll be a whole segment it'll be a
01:38:24 whole side segment every week I'll update you on how my on how my garden is progressing on how much
01:38:30 my invasive rose species have taken over the island Ben's garden roses blacker than his soul
01:38:39 there you go start with that go with it yeah um and uh and yeah I'll show okay I'll put a picture
01:38:45 of the flag I'll go to picture that later it's nice it's cool I'm proud of it um I was gonna I feel
01:38:50 like I oh uh the multiplayer I haven't I haven't sprung for the friggin nintendo subscription when
01:38:56 you do let me know Ben I'll be here but I want to because like you're playing it I guess Michelle's
01:39:00 playing it mage is playing it I think Kazi and munchie are gonna start they're they've been talking
01:39:05 about getting it um and you know that's how that's how you maximize your turnip games oh yeah as you
01:39:10 you visit you you take your native fruit and you sell it on other islands and you you go to other
01:39:14 other islands and you sell your turnips there if they've got a good asking price that right right
01:39:19 game the system plus uh what what fruit what fruits have you got what fruits have you got right now
01:39:23 I'm I've got all five fruits now oh god I need to steal some of my friend Toby Toby went to um
01:39:30 he got the he did multiplayer and he went to one of his friends island and that guy had pairs
01:39:34 which was the last one we've got but I've got on my little on my little sides my little section
01:39:39 of the island my little peninsula that I live on I have turned it into a peach grove it's just
01:39:43 peaches over there nice Toby's got pears and Caleb has oranges and John's just got trash nothing
01:39:49 but trash how close your peach trees together because I'm debating if I should move them to be a
01:39:53 tighter knit thing do you have one space between them or two or three no I have them pretty loose
01:39:58 pretty loose okay okay I've got them in a nice grid uh there we have an orchard that's like that
01:40:04 yeah um there's um uh uh uh uh uh oh did I okay so my friend John he's he's he's building trash
01:40:11 island I think I mentioned this yeah well I had an experience right I went on an expedition
01:40:17 to a wild island and it seemed like a normal island at first but what I realized is that
01:40:23 it is a trash island and there were no fish only trash oh oh I see there was nothing in the water
01:40:30 except trash to fish up so I fished up tons of it and I unlocked a recipe for a trash wall and
01:40:35 trash flooring yeah I did that too and I made and I was like well I gotta make this so I made them
01:40:40 and I sent it to him and they're in his house now and we're all you know it's cooperative you know
01:40:44 we're all working together for the betterment of mankind somebody wants trash by god we're
01:40:49 gonna give them trash that's beautiful one last thing yeah um uh think talking about slimes and
01:40:57 slime runcher and puddle slimes reminded me of of this funny little chart that has been I made
01:41:04 for like a conversation in the endless war disco about types of slime girls that could exist
01:41:12 lakroy girls totally formless and transparent lakroy girls puddle slimes are basically lakroy
01:41:20 girls um so like there's the formless formless to viscous so like the the the you know the the
01:41:26 goopier they are yeah and then saturated to transparent because we were trying to decide
01:41:31 this is the one that the people need to be on where am I so these are all technically slime
01:41:36 girls we decided that that is an umbrella term yeah because uh slime is the main thing of endless
01:41:41 but specifically types of like you know types of slime girls goo girls are making a big thing
01:41:48 people know in in what a goo girl is goo girls limited is like an up and coming conglomeration
01:41:55 that's what started this thing keep hearing about this I see I don't know if I don't I'm a little
01:42:01 iffy on this whole on I feel like golem girls and sludge girls should be swaps I was gonna say
01:42:07 how can I sound like a solid a golem come on yeah I added that I added the golem girls thing but
01:42:13 like I didn't want to have them overlap and sludge girls was already there it was like a
01:42:17 cooperative like uh graph creation I say I see no glue like glue girls glue girls yeah because
01:42:25 they're the transparent but also yeah like epoxy resin girls oh I want that fruit girl
01:42:32 glue girl so I live in orange juice girl that'd be an orange juice girl that was like a glass of
01:42:37 orange juice with an anime face and for I forget what is a gunge what's a gunge girl gunge is like
01:42:43 the the watery extremely neon green slime that is used in Nickelodeon the kids and stuff okay okay I
01:42:51 see oh is it I remember in the UK is is they get you get gunged and then like what the fuck okay
01:42:58 on Nickelodeon uh Nickelodeon and things of that nature you know those sorts of kids kids kids
01:43:05 game shows where kids compete to do stuff and if they fail they get gross gunge poured on them that
01:43:11 is very perverse um I don't like it I remember one time Carl Pilkington was talking about tv
01:43:18 and he called tv that he doesn't like glunge telly um nobody speaking the word nobody knows what it
01:43:25 means I think it's like a little I think he's a glunge telly I don't know classic classic moment
01:43:34 I love this I'm gonna put myself I want to be um I think I'm I think I'm
01:43:41 newt viscous formless I'm kind of in the middle but I'm heavily saturated like I'm kind of like
01:43:48 right in the middle like closer to the top yeah I feel like I've got to be further viscous than
01:43:52 formless personally and fairly saturated as well that's that's where I feel you kind of about where
01:43:58 ooze girls are uh yeah maybe slightly upper right a little bit more but yeah in that area that's
01:44:03 that's where I feel yeah okay yeah what's the girl are you this is the chart I'm closest to ooze girl
01:44:07 yeah I suppose I let's see a highly saturated kind of middle of the road viscosity would be like um
01:44:15 um no there's already a jelly girl uh yeah like a really sweet jelly or really like some sort of
01:44:21 toxic waste syrup syrup girl maybe yeah maybe yeah maybe syrup I don't know that's kind of viscous
01:44:27 but kind of formless maybe magma I mean I don't know a workshop it yeah a workshop it yeah I love it
01:44:35 uh place yourselves on the chart everyone oh where would mercury be that's gotta be uh
01:44:41 ooh that's good how about that would be that would be a sort of like gunge but all the way to the top
01:44:47 because it is certainly very saturated you cannot see through it yeah but it is very liquidy
01:44:52 yeah oh gunge girls but at the top yeah yeah to the right of fruit yeah perhaps
01:44:56 although it's fruit really more but it's heavy though mercury is like thick and heavy even
01:45:00 that it's very like fast flowing but it's yeah like all the way to the top a maybe middle to the
01:45:08 right I I don't know so I top I'm not sure it's certainly not transparent certainly not certainly
01:45:14 we can all agree on that experts agree they call it quick so I feel like because it moves quick
01:45:20 for a goop it should be more formal I don't I don't know yeah yeah I get it all right that's a good
01:45:26 girl it's a good girl and debate the nuances of this you know indeed we could spend all day with
01:45:30 that but we've got voicemails to get to and oh wait sorry on the subject of slime I do want to
01:45:35 mention that the rfck pin Kickstarter oh yeah is doing really good we've had a bunch of people
01:45:41 have just pledged at like the 250-dollar tier because to which lets them just pick their own
01:45:47 design like no vote like they just get to choose what they want cool we've had a bunch of people
01:45:52 we're up to like three thousand dollars almost nice which is what I was hoping yeah two thousand
01:45:57 seven hundred and two dollars and the next vote the next pin design that we're gonna vote on will
01:46:03 be at three thousand unless someone else pledges the 250 and then it'll go up by that much
01:46:09 the because you know because because it's each we get we get a voted one at every 250
01:46:15 dollars of like free donations as in not ones that are like okay this is specifically for
01:46:20 this design that I choose myself and I see that you have updated with all the pins that are available
01:46:25 right now are big in the center there we're getting we're getting the cop killer pin rowdy
01:46:30 fucker pin smear ghost nega slime pin the slime the slime coin challenge coin
01:46:35 fuck yeah which is like it's like the big like sort of display coin it'll be like it'll probably be
01:46:40 like half dollar silver dollar size so cool roughly so cool um uh we get the the the the
01:46:46 slime core pin i'm glad that made it in um a sort of like night sky design by labla labungus p and
01:46:57 and uh smear like collaborated on that one it's glorious there is a this is i'm really excited
01:47:02 about someone should taco chose an iron-on pat you know how people were like the german flag
01:47:07 patch yeah on their like shoulder it's like that but it's the endless war flag really cool that's
01:47:12 a really i think that's super cool and i am gonna have to get a new jacket just yeah put it on
01:47:18 oh it's so cool i love it i know i remember all the struggles about choosing the perfect flag and
01:47:23 all the voting and all the debating i'm so happy with the flag that was eventually chosen it was
01:47:28 yeah it was like a huge ordeal we had like we did another like vote thing like people submitted
01:47:33 their designs then we had like a bunch of rounds of voting on them and then like a couple of the
01:47:36 winners like sort of got together in a call and like collaborate and sort of like put them all
01:47:40 together and decided on like okay here's a good like sort of mixture of all the elements that we
01:47:45 like it's great so i like endless war i try it's running i try to run it very democratically i try
01:47:52 to make it very you know community driven of course is one of the i guess one of the mission
01:47:56 statements of it one of the main sustaining factors i'd say that's what we're that's what
01:48:01 that's what it'd be that's what's up that's what's happening did you clarify that like at 3000 there's
01:48:06 like a new stretch goal or something because i just see uh unless unless someone else donates
01:48:13 the 250 the 3000 would be the next time we hold like a vote unlike which uh which new design to
01:48:21 make i see i see okay we actually got a little behind um right now it was further behind before
01:48:27 but it's caught up um we were behind where like uh uh um more people had pledged to make specific
01:48:35 designs we had basically we had voted on more designs than we had actually gotten money to make
01:48:41 so we were in the hole for a minute and i was just gonna have to like pony up like a couple hundred
01:48:46 dollars how did that even happen it was you masked that out okay well no i didn't that's the problem
01:48:54 because like the initial goal it was 600 at first later on i decided that we could do it for 500 so
01:49:01 i moved the stretch goals down later sure sure but so effectively the initial goal it was 500
01:49:06 dollars to make the first two pins and then 250 on top of that basically um okay we had a bunch
01:49:15 of people had pledged and that had been enough to fund uh it ended up being the the smear pin
01:49:21 and the coin and then i was like hey i've got an idea if someone pledges 250 they're basically
01:49:27 funding the whole pin themselves they should be able to choose whatever they want so i made that
01:49:31 a tier sure okay 250 dollar tier pick your own pin and a bunch of people and i don't want anyone
01:49:36 to like feel like they shouldn't have done this it's fine it all worked out but but some people
01:49:40 that had already pledged up to their pledges to a 250 tier so those are actually doing it's only
01:49:47 adding like 200 or whatever yeah so their previous pledges had gone towards like you know the amount
01:49:54 that meant that we could have new pins to design right right so that was no longer going because
01:49:59 now it was going towards uh you know an individually decided pin so because we had already you know
01:50:06 voted and agreed like yes we will be making these two this the the the ghost and the coin uh we ended
01:50:12 up being you know in in the hole for that i see i see not anymore we've like basically caught up
01:50:19 now well cool i feel like a i'm sorry i fucked it up to to uh to get like the patch and the slam
01:50:27 court pin because i want yeah i want all of these i i don't know whether i want will have the money
01:50:34 to like buy all of them to get funded but probably a lot yeah um i'm hoping i'm rooting for if we do
01:50:42 another one i'm hoping that the muck cup i want the podron i want the podron as well and i would
01:50:48 all i would really like the muck cup uh badge too would be pretty cool um but what's fucking there's
01:50:53 like digimon with a hat going on on here what is that shit about digimon with a hat there's like
01:50:59 some white nibba with blue on him with a backward what's that guy's story that's um that's red five
01:51:05 rainbow a couple of people just like submitted their own guys i mean pizza chan i know everyone
01:51:10 loves pizza chan everyone loves pizza yeah it's you know there's a t-fap red man wait what is this
01:51:17 image you scroll down on the kickstarter page on the kickstarter the ones of like potential future
01:51:22 designs okay first one is podron and muck cup and then yeah so some people were just like hey
01:51:27 make me a pin and i was like well i said i would accept anyone's submissions so god damn it i will
01:51:35 very so i did it and i put them on the list and they're available to be voted on i wouldn't mind
01:51:39 if that's the will of the people then so be it pizza chan's cool um sure yeah one question because i
01:51:46 am going to pledge i just wanted to decide when and how much so i i can pledge for a certain number
01:51:51 of pins and then is it afterward i'll be sent like a thing to like fill out a form of which ones i want
01:51:56 is that the yes okay yeah i can pledge now without worrying about which ones if new ones get added or
01:52:01 yeah you can like like if you pledge you know 50 or whatever right now then you get five pins
01:52:08 and then after the kickstarter's overall send you a message and be like okay well which five do you
01:52:12 want okay gotcha and the slime part one is two the big the slime uh yes people have been confused
01:52:16 i've said it a bunch of places but people still are confused so i should keep saying it over and over
01:52:20 again the coin counts as two so if you pledge for two you get the coin you just get the coin if you
01:52:26 pledge for three right you get the coin and one others if you want the coin because the coin is
01:52:29 like way bigger and it's way more it's way more metal you know yeah yeah that's why i want uh yeah i
01:52:36 want one i did make by the way ben a smoother version of the red man face if we needed that for a pin
01:52:43 i i mean if that if that got like funded or anything because i don't know whether the the the harsh
01:52:49 angles could could you post it i'd love to see it just i saw that i posted in the main hit but i saw
01:52:53 that and i put it on i thought i put it on this image i definitely put it on the next like grid
01:52:59 for voting uh i thought i had updated this one with it too i guess i didn't but yeah i have that
01:53:05 i made like a pin mock-up out of it and i just forgot to friggin put it here nice yeah yeah yeah
01:53:11 it would be very hilarious to have a serious would be pretty funny i do like red man a lot
01:53:16 red man it's the boy it's so fucking weird
01:53:23 oh geez his face is off is that red is that red on the on the list
01:53:31 well because you know uh there's only there's only certain colors available uh oh this red i
01:53:37 didn't check oh it's exactly the the the red selection is pretty robust so probably something
01:53:43 very similar would be there but yeah like especially like greens like there's a couple of like
01:53:49 they don't have any greens that are like quite what i would have wanted they're like
01:53:53 none of them are quite as bright as i want it's kind of a shame but like yeah you there's a there's
01:53:58 a guide there's like a formula there's a pantone guide and it's like okay all the colors that we
01:54:03 can use on the pins have to be from this selection although i it's weird because there's no white
01:54:10 on that list and yet i know that white is available because i got the poobah pins and the endless war
01:54:16 pins yeah not the and the infinite chess pins and they've got white on them so i sent them an email
01:54:21 asking like hey what's up with that is there like yeah other colors that are available that aren't
01:54:25 on the list like i don't know because i would like to know but it's it's a little weird but white is
01:54:31 definitely a thing but yeah gotta follow the guide ah anyway i was curious about like the
01:54:37 challenge coin and the one below it like the the rfck town or whatever the endless war those are
01:54:43 like fairly intricate but i assume none of those are probably even though i guess the cop killer
01:54:46 and the munchie one they should be the the one with the sky yeah it might cost like five bucks
01:54:53 more to make because it has like i think it has six colors instead of five yeah but like it's like
01:54:58 not even a big deal um yeah it can be as intricate as it wants to be as long as like the metal sections
01:55:03 are like a minimum width size they have to be like a like 0.2 millimeters or maybe like or half a
01:55:09 millimeter yeah cool and like it's not it's it's you can get pretty fine with the detail and like
01:55:15 you can even you can even put like a hole like on the slime core pin if i if you wanted i could
01:55:21 have put like little gaps in between like the red parts you know what i mean yeah yeah okay there
01:55:25 could like you can get like what's called cutouts like holes in the design it costs a little bit
01:55:30 more but like not that much more it's doable sure sure so yeah they can fucking they can make them
01:55:36 they can make them fucking many old friggin way you dang want pretty fucking sick hey ben how did
01:55:42 you make these images was it like a did you just put it in and it makes an auto-generated like fake
01:55:48 thing or did you actually like photoshop no i i photoshop them i have a process it's um could
01:55:54 you do a youtube tutorial explaining do you want me to i really would because it looks great
01:56:00 it's like they do look great such a really good way to make it look 3d and shiny i could straight
01:56:06 up do that if you wanted one man wants at least i'd watch it um i'm curious i could explain the
01:56:15 technique or i could yeah all right maybe i'll just make a little tutorial it's like how to make
01:56:21 how to do the very specific thing of taking an image and making it look like a pseudo 3d shiny
01:56:27 pin lamel i have i have a little technique that i just go through with and it takes me like
01:56:32 five ten minutes apiece it's not that it's not that complicated like i like i could probably
01:56:38 figure it out but like yeah there's a few things i'm not quite sure about i i um yeah i i'll do it
01:56:46 because it's uh you know i'm a i'm a genius uh only i could have done this um i must share
01:56:54 my technique with the world it's the grand follow-up to the jennifer diane writes lecture
01:56:58 that everyone's been waiting for how to turn an image into a pin it was shiny pin oh maybe i don't
01:57:04 want maybe i don't want to like shit up my channel with that oh well no you can you would not hurt
01:57:10 anything at the same time that's true oh yeah i mean that's true that wouldn't hurt that's true it
01:57:14 would also serve as a ad for the kickstarter interesting okay well well let ben debate
01:57:21 would struggle uh for a long time on his own let us now get to our voicemails we've got like
01:57:26 how many uh eight total oh christ don't worry we'll move through quickly fuck yeah yeah okay first
01:57:34 up is a fitter weeb than nate uh has something to say let's listen go hey pcp just finish the old
01:57:41 workout because when you're quarantining your apartment what else are you gonna do like any good
01:57:45 anime trash panda i listen to a decent amount of opz and covers while i lift and run and do all the
01:57:50 other things that nate claims that he does it never gets around to doing listening to this music
01:57:54 got me thinking though our covers of music really art all you're doing is trying to imitate the work
01:57:59 of let's face it more talented musicians and writers maybe there's some argument to be made
01:58:03 that when you have to translate lyrics there's a value in that but it still seems like a lesser
01:58:07 art form nobody cares about the copies of the Mona Lisa no matter how good they are after all
01:58:11 anyways what do you guys and gals think um simple a good a good cover is a reinterpretation of the
01:58:18 original song to a degree well he said two things in there he said is it art but then later he said
01:58:25 like is less art you could certainly make a case that it's like lesser art i mean i think everything
01:58:32 that's lesser like everything that's unoriginal about a thing is a point against it so yeah to
01:58:37 a certain extent i agree but i think there is an art to doing a cover and like you can take an old
01:58:44 song and do an original twist on it and that's a good cover if i feel like i feel like generally
01:58:50 if the cover is trying to do its own thing too much but it's still recognizable as the first
01:58:57 thing it's just annoying and i'd rather listen to the real thing like very rarely would cover
01:59:02 like transcend the original um you are forgetting about the the techno remix of discord
01:59:11 yeah that's a really right that's that's a different sort of thing if we're talking about
01:59:15 covers i suppose where do you draw the line that's true i mean they're all in the same ballpark
01:59:22 i'd say i feel like a cover is just you know like a lady singing a song uh but doing like a little
01:59:31 stranger like well well well well well well you've just described a shitty cover yeah yeah what about
01:59:37 the best cover ever hey for example um i think Nina Simone originally made the song don't let me be
01:59:44 misunderstood but then the monkeys no no wait it was what the fuck no who was it somewhat the
01:59:50 and it was the animals not the fucking monkeys uh the animals made the most famous version of
01:59:56 don't let me be misunderstood that most people know uh that was a cover of a song and i mean
02:00:02 throughout history of music there have been many famous songs that are more popular and more
02:00:07 beloved in their remake form you've got an original shoutouts to the uga chaka cover of hooked on a
02:00:13 feeling indeed um that isn't wait that isn't the original one no no it is not yeah that's right
02:00:21 right i just thought it was strange you know i guess it comes down to i don't know there's there's a
02:00:28 there's a there's a Todd in the shadows video about that song yeah apparently there are other
02:00:33 there was like another cover of it that also says uga chaka and like strange yeah nobody
02:00:39 he doesn't have any like explanation for why it's there maybe it's actually a cover of the
02:00:44 animals version or not the animals whoever made that fucking umba umba whatever the fuck the
02:00:49 orange skiffs okay i'm fucking about their names well blue suede is the ones that did the cover
02:00:56 i don't know there's like there's like four different covers of it so i don't even know
02:00:59 who's the original i as with everything i will i will say remakes and redoes can be good but
02:01:07 nonetheless i always think it's a waste of time which is different by the way from a remaster
02:01:14 a remaster is a different sort of animal and can usually be what the fuck are you talking about
02:01:20 well like for if you that's a wild opinion well like if the Beatles go remaster like their album
02:01:26 and then re-release it as Nate oh it's slightly i still don't like it Nate but there are different
02:01:30 things a cover a cover is a reinterpretation of source material a remaster is literally just
02:01:38 the same thing again uh okay you know what literally the same thing yeah all right we
02:01:43 just like courting the music to music to we'll worry about that later okay uh by by the way
02:01:50 i forgot to say uh speak pipe is where you leave the voicemails at the beginning uh there's a good
02:01:55 cover you know brings something new to the table and it the way it interprets the thing and in that
02:02:00 way yes it is definitely art in of itself yeah that's my but ben isn't it fair to say no any cover
02:02:06 we'll introduce things that are different that you could call introducing something new even
02:02:10 if it's just like the vocal instructions of the singer yes of course that's true what's your point
02:02:16 then doesn't it just matter like it's it's a matter of deducing is that change good or bad so you
02:02:21 just have to have a totally separate conversation of you know yes what is the nature that you idiot
02:02:26 that doesn't friggin idiot obviously yes you have to determine did the change make it better or worse
02:02:32 obviously yeah ben was not making a quality judgment you just say it is art like i don't think
02:02:39 like quality necessarily has anything to do with whether something is like like changes something
02:02:45 you can change something in a bad way or a good way that's the the original question was about
02:02:49 whether or not it counts as art itself which i think we all basically agree with yes yes didn't
02:02:55 didn't you just say no didn't you just say they're a waste of time well just because something's a
02:02:59 waste of time doesn't make it not art it might just be bad or you know well okay are you no i'm
02:03:05 not gonna let this go are you are you really are you really gonna put your flag in the sand right
02:03:10 here and say that all covers are or or or re or what was the other thing you said remastered no you
02:03:17 said you liked remasters what was the other thing you said i didn't even say i liked remastered i
02:03:20 said they were a different thing okay that's what i said okay let's just stick with covers are you
02:03:24 really gonna stick your foot in the sand and say all covers are a waste of time um
02:03:29 uh well okay well you say a waste i wouldn't recommend it i i think your energy is better
02:03:35 spend making original stuff i'm already talking about making it or consuming it making it right
02:03:41 because that is a distinction i'm talking about making it talking about making it i i i i i sometimes
02:03:46 feel that because it's like from a monetary standpoint at least you're not able to profit
02:03:53 off of the work you put in as much as if it was an original thing because you gotta i just want
02:03:58 new ideas you gotta play royalties to the original look look look okay you're not you're not always
02:04:04 in control of your own creativity sometimes like imagine you hear a song and you're like ooh
02:04:11 you know this is a good song but like what if it did this instead of this like oh like what if it
02:04:15 was kind of performed like this a little differently like that would like totally change the the feel
02:04:19 of it that like it could sound really good that way hmm that's a good idea that would sound good
02:04:24 and then so you go and you like you record it and you produce it and you make a new version
02:04:28 of the song and it's a cover like why is that a waste of time you know i i guess when i think
02:04:34 about it i i i i of course i have the ff7 remake in my mind you know there is a major distinction
02:04:39 here in terms of the medium because music isn't like you can make music way faster than a video game
02:04:46 and the cultural impact of these things is very different when like the company makes a remake
02:04:53 of a thing it's like there was the original there were a bunch of remasters for various platforms
02:04:57 now there is the remake and like that's what exists when you've got like lots of people able to make
02:05:03 covers all the time uh like sure it can't like the whatever like Nina Simone's version of don't let me
02:05:09 be misunderstood kind of has been forgotten uh for like the animals cover because it's more popular
02:05:14 people like it more uh is that bad i don't know but it's it's it's a different situation because
02:05:19 it's not like the copyright holders of the song made another version of their thing it basically
02:05:24 is like a fan version that happened to be popular there was no like corporate stamp saying we need
02:05:29 to upgrade this thing i don't know it's just different and there's nuance to it i don't know okay
02:05:36 all right there's there's words i'm satisfied let us go to our next voicemail which is from
02:05:43 your loyal fan all right oh hi pcp uh it's me your loyal fan i just wanted to say that these
02:05:51 lectures lately have been amazing they've been worth every penny yeah um truly the best content
02:05:57 you guys ever make are these long form deep dive personal lectures as a team i mean it's just
02:06:04 probably true more of these more of these and you know what we shouldn't have to wait for radcon to
02:06:09 do these um just hop into a discord everybody be in a chat and just do like a podcast recording style
02:06:16 lecture like this shit is so good i'm addicted i'm a coke addict is what i'm saying i understand
02:06:23 the one i was thinking i was thinking about i understand the desire but i just don't think
02:06:28 it would be i mean it would be like a progress in his podcast like with the with the small
02:06:33 latency issues somebody like there's always gonna be a difficulty with trying to be the
02:06:39 main guy when everyone else can interject as loud as like like equally loud when you're standing up
02:06:46 and everyone is sitting down it's a very different atmosphere that is true i don't think there are
02:06:51 enough things in the world that i could make like a lecture length video discussing that i would have
02:06:59 like the interest in making i don't think i could do that like once a month or or that like i would
02:07:04 run out of things i would have to i would have to like investigate and spend some time to like
02:07:09 learn about things it could be done but i'm also i agree with ben's point such that i'm happy to
02:07:15 space these things out maybe like once a year that you'll get one maybe two for me like there are
02:07:20 all things that i have like a long-standing interest in yeah i mean i guess i could find a new thing
02:07:26 and like deep dive it and then but would it turn into a full band would that have soul i feel like
02:07:31 it might i feel like it could end up having less soul perhaps that's the risk that is the risk
02:07:39 i think this is one of the negatives of my final fantasy lecture by covering the whole series
02:07:43 including like 11 and 14 which i've like barely played if at all and don't care about it i just
02:07:49 felt i had to as a checklist yeah it has to be something that i'm genuinely interested in and
02:07:55 you know i can't make i can't make that happen indeed indeed i'm definitely going to do a better
02:08:02 job next time i feel like i didn't didn't truly explain i mean it's a silly topic the risk are
02:08:08 you gonna do brisco 102 i literally could um because i didn't talk about the epilogues or
02:08:14 homestuck 2 which i might be funny follow up but homestuck 2 could go on for years and i'd rather
02:08:20 like have that finish before i even think about that but um sure i could do one on the entirety
02:08:26 of homestuck which would be hilarious like because of how long it is but there's also other things
02:08:32 that i have like i have a big interest in and that's a good one yeah i only know like of the very
02:08:40 minimum about that but like from what i know i think that could make a really good yeah lecture
02:08:44 agreed yeah agreed and uh yeah that that's that's potential in fact actually alias cut that out
02:08:52 bleep it bleep it so that nobody knows what it is okay just in case somebody has the smart idea
02:08:58 of like stealing my lecture before i have a chance to do it oh yeah i do hate that i do hate that
02:09:02 and uh you know i just it's a different situation because it's not us or anything but like on this
02:09:07 idea of like the online ones i am good i am curious to hear what the reception to like um uh ash
02:09:13 vampires uh like bionicle one i'll be curious to see what people think about that in terms of the
02:09:18 format and whatnot just uh you know just for fun hi but uh no matter in any case let us move on to our
02:09:25 next voicemail please this is the uh ff7 mandela effect okay go so i was sleeping after jacking
02:09:35 off for like 10 times because i'm in quarantine you know and then nelson mandela came to my bed
02:09:41 and with his black magic transported me to a parallel universe where the final fantasy seven
02:09:46 remake is good uh i mean it's amazing the boxer is actually a square they made it specifically
02:09:53 a square despite all other ps4 covers being rectangle they even made it soft like soft square
02:10:00 i think i think the box is made of uh japanese noodles also there's no gay shit like a fact that
02:10:07 there's only 80 of sexual shit speaking of that tifa's tits are huge like not that huge
02:10:15 that ben sehn would goom instantly at the merseys but bro they are big her thighs also are big
02:10:22 so uh yeah too bad for you but uh in this universe the remake is great
02:10:31 i dream too bad that in this universe hitler won oh yeah i was waiting for it i was waiting
02:10:37 for a twist i'll take that trade any day of the week hitler won um you know the the japanese
02:10:45 were became the master race of the oriental world uh and so square square was better than ever
02:10:52 all their video games were great fantastic i'm glad that happened spectacular uh let me let me
02:10:58 get in on that all right but let's uh go next we've got a message from uh marlo a message from marlo
02:11:05 and bear with me marlo here we go marlo i don't know marlo see ya just watched one piece lecture
02:11:13 it was great loved it burned a lot and i feel like i should tell you nate there is a real life
02:11:18 version of the one piece treasure that you could pursue you could have your own one piece out of
02:11:23 adventure your own hero's journey if you wanted to so there's this guy forced fen he's born 1930
02:11:30 and he grew up reading the first chapters of one piece and 70 odd years later he amassed fortune
02:11:36 so he could make one piece real and he had a treasure the fen treasure like over a million
02:11:42 dollars somewhere in the red line of the united states being the rocky mountains and he left
02:11:48 his poem that gives cryptic directions to the treasure so this is something you're interested
02:11:53 in i suggest you investigate it further uh you know it was i so i i looked this up there was
02:12:00 something called fen's treasure a cache of gold and jewels which this man forest fen an art dealer
02:12:06 from santa fe new mexico claims before he died is hidden in the rocky mountains of the united states
02:12:13 and he did leave cryptic clues to try to get people to go find it uh it has not been found
02:12:20 it may not exist just like one piece potentially but it's supposed to be out there and uh oh put
02:12:27 a bunch of money together what's what's that game there was like an old game minecraft no
02:12:34 shut up idiot um this uh fuck guess who there's a dammit there's a wait leave me alone i gotta
02:12:42 find this thing i want to bring this up it's relevant um okay i gotta concentrate i gotta
02:12:46 concentrate find the content um no keep talking keep talking world craft um yeah keep saying
02:12:54 video games um legal legends final fantasy two team fortress two uh is it a board game
02:13:00 is it a video game what is the endless war fortress um search masquerade uh masquerade
02:13:08 vampire there is a oh yeah okay okay there is what's the video game version okay there is a
02:13:17 this is all gonna make sense this is all gonna make sense there was a book there was a book
02:13:24 called masquerade and it was a an art book by a guy named kit williams and the art in the book
02:13:31 was like it contained like cryptic hints that if you solve the puzzles you could find a real
02:13:37 treasure that was buried somewhere in england in it was like a piece of like golden jewelry it was
02:13:44 it was a golden hair it was like a rabbit pendant right oh okay and um yeah so that was like it was
02:13:50 like a really popular book it was an international sensation did that happen that yes um cool and
02:13:57 there but there was like a due to some like weird like the guy who like won the contest with an
02:14:04 asterisk there's an asterisk on he won it um but he like he got the hair and he like used it as
02:14:10 startup capital to start a company and he basically like self-funded a video game sequel
02:14:17 to masquerade that that purported to also tell you where you could find the golden hair
02:14:24 that's so cool well it was awful it was a terrible game and probably it was a scam and probably
02:14:30 there was no fuck there is a great fucking video on youtube about this um youtube.com
02:14:38 this sword quest otari or is that something else wait um um was this an old video game it's yeah
02:14:46 it's all like the old freaking otari or whatever oh who is this okay i gotta look at my subscriptions
02:14:55 right because i'm subscribed to this guy he does these like he's done a couple of like really
02:14:59 interesting videos talking about like old games you've never heard of and shit and he is just like
02:15:04 it reminds me of that one AVGN episode where he's talking about sword quest which is a game
02:15:10 that gave out real gold prizes for beating the otari game and like the chalice and the crown
02:15:16 and the sword and whatever and like the the real mystery is like where the final prizes are because
02:15:20 all the games didn't come out because they went bust it's like where's the fucking magical sword
02:15:25 um great golden ben i found it it's called hair razor it's called hair razor yes yes that's it on
02:15:35 the wikipedia page yeah okay there okay i found 1984 there is a really interesting video it is

02:21:31 leftist beforehand yeah oh please do what do you guys um um i you know in my humble opinion in my
02:21:41 humble opinion a wage theft not a fan not a fan of that i rest of the pcp you useless piece of
02:21:51 shit you absolute waste of space and air you uneducated ignorant idiotic dumb swine you're an
02:21:59 absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole the magnitude of your failure just now is
02:22:04 so indescribably massive that 100 years into the future your name will be used as an insult by edgy
02:22:11 12 year olds even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there's no conceivable
02:22:16 way they could have thought of a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did when jesus
02:22:21 died first since he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing
02:22:26 because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have
