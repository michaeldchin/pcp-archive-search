00:00:00 It's the same every day. Scrolling, always scrolling, looking for answers. But none ever
00:00:14 come. Who are you? It's been over a year since this search began and we're no closer
00:00:28 to finding out than when we started. I'm starting to think maybe he doesn't want to be found.
00:00:36 Well, we've done our best. I guess there are some things you just have to learn to let go.
00:00:44 After all, we're only human.
00:00:58 Sir, our calculation show at 99% matched.
00:01:13 Do them again, damn you. We have to be sure.
00:01:30 It's me, Austin. Oh, son of a bitch.
00:01:43 Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Procrastinator's Podcast.
00:02:06 I am the best guy ever, your host, The Best Man. Dude, did you just see the guy there
00:02:12 saying we know who he is? Okay, yes, we've got a huge announcement, people, a huge announcement.
00:02:17 But before we get to that, we have Hippocrates here. He's a guy that isn't real. We've got Munchy.
00:02:24 Oh, fucking press, wait, it's the fucking it's him. We've got Monkey Jones. I wish I was dead.
00:02:31 Big Manga anime fan here, and we've got Endless Jess.
00:02:39 Hi. Endless Jess. Hi, everybody. I'm in the game.
00:02:44 Is that Homestar Runner? Is that Homestuck, my favorite character? Is that Homo Jess?
00:02:51 Is that Skip and Take? It's me. It's me, Hobo Jess.
00:02:55 It's me, Homo Jess.
00:03:02 Everyone's favorite character from the Endless Jessiverse.
00:03:06 Okay, guys, we have a huge announcement today, and we've got a bombshell announcement,
00:03:09 not maybe like two hours ago. We finally had an answer to the question that's been
00:03:14 plaguing scientists for generations. All right, we have Virgin. The answer is yes.
00:03:19 The answer is yes. But unrelated, but similarly as important.
00:03:24 We have cracked the code. We have discovered the identity of the PCP guy, our mascot guy.
00:03:30 We have found out who the fuck he is. Okay, so let's just set this so if anyone doesn't know,
00:03:34 we've been asking people on Twitter and everywhere that this is not a joke. We really had no idea
00:03:39 who this mascot guy was. He was someone that I found one day when I was just on A, and you
00:03:44 know how I like to use a lot of fucking mango reaction faces and shit. I just used him because
00:03:48 he looked like a real procrastinator to me with that expression. So he became the mascot.
00:03:54 And we'd been, I had no idea what the fuck he was. I'd been trying to fight out for,
00:03:56 the show's been going for over a year, and I have been actively looking for that entire time
00:04:00 and as of people. And today is the day where we finally got our answer. So, okay, our buddy over
00:04:05 on Twitter at Stumble Reel, Akane 3, I don't know, at Stumble Reel. Apparently, actually,
00:04:13 it's months ago, actually, he had tweeted at Ben Saints. So, Stumble Reel here had tweeted at Ben
00:04:22 Saints like months ago. The act like the information about the guy, but Ben didn't get it because
00:04:27 he's an idiot. He doesn't, can't do anything right. But yeah, he's gone. He's dead. But today,
00:04:33 he linked in response to the recent conversation we've been having about who the fuck this guy is,
00:04:37 he provided a screenshot of the actual page. So we're talking about page 14, page 13 of
00:04:44 chapter five of the manga, Inari Konkon Koi Iroha. If you go to that fucking page,
00:04:50 there'll be a link in the description so you can see for yourself. They, he is the boy himself
00:04:54 by the name of Toka Fushimi, character from this manga. So we're talking about Toka.
00:05:00 Hiroshima.
00:05:04 What's even more disappointing is that this was one of Digi's top 10
00:05:08 animes of 2014 and he didn't even recognize the character.
00:05:12 Isn't that fascinating? And we, you should be able to see on the screen.
00:05:15 Yes, that's right.
00:05:17 That's how we found out.
00:05:18 Her though, he's gay.
00:05:19 And we look on this, on the screen, you'll see that what we have there is the anime version
00:05:24 of this exact pose from like chapter, chapter five of the manga.
00:05:28 He's a real anime.
00:05:30 He did it.
00:05:30 He's a real anime.
00:05:31 He really did it.
00:05:32 He did it.
00:05:32 You know, I, I, I, it's, it's amazing.
00:05:35 We're so proud of him.
00:05:37 He's come so far.
00:05:37 I, I am immediately, I'm immediately fascinated by this character. And by the way guys, I looked
00:05:42 up his Wikipedia entry. I thought I'd read you a little snippet so you could know that what
00:05:46 we're dealing with here is the most red-pilled hardcore motherfucker who's ever existed. All right.
00:05:53 Okay. So here we go. Here we go. So here's Toka Fushimi's little bio from the Wikipedia page.
00:05:59 Toka, he is handsome, but a recluse who spends his time away from others and keeps to himself,
00:06:06 frequently studying to get into a good university and also has a strange poem blog post.
00:06:11 So we're talking about an internet creator here, a kindred spirit to us.
00:06:16 He is also short-tempered and childish, relatable, relatable.
00:06:20 Especially the childish part.
00:06:21 Yeah.
00:06:23 Frequently being referred to as having eighth grade syndrome or, you know, G-B-O.
00:06:27 He's an eighth grade syndrome.
00:06:30 Oh my God. I finally know what I am.
00:06:34 I don't know. Okay. I don't know if you guys are joking, but that's Chunebio. It's like a specific
00:06:37 thing in Japan where like kids think they have superpowers and like pretend that their evil
00:06:43 organizations are like following them. It's, it's a big, Google Chune's and you'll see like,
00:06:48 it's a real thing.
00:06:48 That's literally returning from NAROTO?
00:06:52 Yes.
00:06:52 Sounds like it's on NHK.
00:06:54 It's, it's some gay Japanimation shit.
00:06:57 So yeah, he's a Chune despite being in his last year of high school.
00:07:00 He also tends to get lost easily.
00:07:02 He's, so he's a millennial who doesn't understand directions.
00:07:04 Yeah.
00:07:05 He is protective of Inari and initially apprehensive of Uka, who's like the ghost
00:07:10 magic spirit from the series, believes that she has malicious intents,
00:07:13 but realizes she is a good person and befriends her.
00:07:16 Oh, befriending a woman, very blue pill, very blue pill.
00:07:19 Even letting her come over to play games.
00:07:20 Playing games with a woman there for procreation and nothing else, you fucking cock.
00:07:25 What else we got here?
00:07:26 Okay, that's it.
00:07:26 The rest is boring.
00:07:27 And he hates sex.
00:07:28 I forgot to read the last sentence there.
00:07:30 Oh yeah.
00:07:30 The last sentence.
00:07:31 Big, big hater of sex.
00:07:34 Big, big fan of the Listen Buddy podcast, funnily enough.
00:07:38 Can I, can I spoil you on the ending of this series guys?
00:07:40 All right, this is a spoiler for the end of this podcast.
00:07:41 No, no, no, no, I wanted to watch it.
00:07:42 I'm going to cover my ears.
00:07:43 Go ahead.
00:07:44 Okay, here we go.
00:07:44 So, okay, at the end, he confesses to like the ghost, the series is over.
00:07:49 In chapter 40 of 43, he confesses his love to Uka, the like spirit ghost lady.
00:07:54 And by the end of the series, he has literally become a god.
00:07:58 So, he could be with her and she has his child.
00:08:01 Oh my god.
00:08:01 So, our boy has started a family.
00:08:04 He's become, he's, he's gone full red pill.
00:08:06 Do you think his child is the PCP?
00:08:10 Oh my god!
00:08:14 Are the spoilers over yet?
00:08:15 I'm still covering my ears.
00:08:16 Does that make us old?
00:08:17 No, they're not done yet.
00:08:19 They're not, I was going to say, we, we, he became a god.
00:08:22 We are gods.
00:08:23 He has given birth to this organization.
00:08:26 Oh my god.
00:08:28 This very important organization.
00:08:30 This very us here.
00:08:32 Our mascot could have turned out to be any old buddy, but I'm not disappointed at all
00:08:37 in this revelation of who he turned out to be.
00:08:40 This is the best possible outcome.
00:08:42 Really, that ending.
00:08:44 We've all got the blood of the Messiah within us.
00:08:46 That's right.
00:08:47 I did not expect for us to be this gold-pilled, but here we are.

00:09:29 All right, guys.
00:09:31 Man, I've got Afterglow.
00:09:34 I've got the Afterglow going.
00:09:35 All right, so let's move on to our actual topic for the day.
00:09:38 Wait, I want to point out one thing real quick if I can, Nate.
00:09:40 Yeah, sure.
00:09:40 Today, this podcast right here is the first time that Munchie and I
00:09:44 have been seen together in public.
00:09:45 Yeah.
00:09:46 That's right.
00:09:46 It's a big deal for me.
00:09:47 It's a big deal for me.
00:09:48 I said all of our secret sescapades.
00:09:50 Right.
00:09:50 You know, you know.
00:09:52 Sescapades.
00:09:53 Yeah, we've had lots of, we've had lots of sescapades
00:09:55 when nobody was looking, but now we're together in a podcast
00:09:57 on the internet.
00:09:58 It's a big deal.
00:09:58 You're really coming out.
00:09:59 It's our first time, yeah, talking.
00:10:01 Now when people fuck up our names.
00:10:02 Now when people fuck up our names.
00:10:02 That's so bad, Nate, you fucking sewer rat.
00:10:05 You guys, if you guys didn't have literally the same name,
00:10:07 it wouldn't be a problem.
00:10:08 But, Nate, I'm going to fucking kill you.
00:10:10 You're dead.
00:10:10 So monumental occasion, and by that, I mean, doesn't,
00:10:16 doesn't matter.
00:10:16 Don't worry about it.
00:10:19 All right.
00:10:19 So let's move on to our fucking topic and let's see how
00:10:21 this Munchie-Mum-Key who has same guy dynamic plays out.
00:10:25 Even I'm going to fuck up the names and I don't even talk
00:10:27 about myself in the third person.
00:10:30 Okay.
00:10:30 So our topic today is irony and sincerity.
00:10:36 Yeah, that's that's what it's going to be.
00:10:38 So let me read the actual question that our buddy
00:10:40 over on the fucking thing asked.
00:10:42 So our question was from atmanslayer0, and he asks,
00:10:47 at TP Crastinators, you could talk about the ubiquity of
00:10:51 self-deprecating humor on the internet and the rise of
00:10:54 wholesome memes.
00:10:55 So, okay, so he's not actually asking a question,
00:10:56 he's just giving us a topic suggestion.
00:10:58 So he's talking about wholesome memes and self-depreciating
00:11:01 humor, but I think the broader scope of what he's asking
00:11:04 is about irony, sincerity, you know, that whole, that whole
00:11:08 whole gang, that whole gang.
00:11:09 It's Seinfeld and how it's the best show ever.
00:11:11 Yep, yep.
00:11:11 And the, when I saw this, my first thought was that video
00:11:14 that some, some fuckboy on YouTube had made recently
00:11:17 about David Foster Wallace and, you know, irony and shit.
00:11:19 Yeah, who searched the problem with irony?
00:11:21 Yeah, it'll tell.
00:11:22 The problem with irony, that's right.
00:11:23 Then I'll have that motherfucker smug face with like the
00:11:25 stupid, like, towel.
00:11:27 The bandam.
00:11:27 You know, I watched that, I watched that video because
00:11:30 you pointed it out right before this podcast, and I was,
00:11:34 I was none too pleased with it.
00:11:35 I have a, I have a, I have a point of contention
00:11:38 with that video.
00:11:39 Oh, let's hear it.
00:11:41 Well, like the whole, or we could do it later.
00:11:42 Ah, the fuck it, who cares?
00:11:44 I think the problem with David Foster Wallace is that
00:11:46 infinite jest is way too fucking long.
00:11:48 I think the problem with David Foster Wallace is that
00:11:50 well, it is supposed to be infinite, so isn't it really
00:11:52 too short?
00:11:54 That's, that's true.
00:11:55 Never ending story was too short.
00:11:58 Yeah, that was, they both lies.
00:11:59 Yeah.
00:12:00 Never ending story is neither late nor early.
00:12:04 It arrives precisely what it needs to.
00:12:07 It's also not a story, it's a movie.
00:12:08 They really shit the bed on that one.
00:12:10 Let me, let me, all right, so let me break down what
00:12:12 this is about.
00:12:13 So in the, in that video, because that's really what
00:12:15 interests me to talk about, it talks about David Foster
00:12:17 Wallace was talking about how the rise of, of post
00:12:21 modernism is sort of, they're, they're within that,
00:12:24 or they're components of it that celebrate the
00:12:26 destruction of like the cultural norms of the day.
00:12:29 So, you know, things like irony are celebrated in the
00:12:34 post modernist, you know, kind of art style that we see
00:12:36 today.
00:12:37 So things like Seinfeld that are sitcoms that make fun
00:12:40 of the wholesomeness and the, the sugary way that
00:12:43 problems get resolved on older classical sitcoms.
00:12:47 It's taking that and making fun of the whole thing.
00:12:49 And so in that way it's being ironic and that's, that's
00:12:51 what post modernism is.
00:12:53 Whereas recently we're seeing things like, like the
00:12:55 show community, even Rick and Morty.
00:12:57 And I, Rick and Morty I think is a really interesting
00:12:59 example because Rick and Morty is a very irreverent
00:13:02 show with a lot of irony laced throughout it.
00:13:04 But there was, and I think Jesse and me especially
00:13:07 do this a lot, we, we relate to the way that it, it is
00:13:12 fully cloaked in irony, but then when you dig down
00:13:14 into it and you just give it time, there's always a
00:13:16 core of emotion and like good vibes that you just
00:13:19 need to crack that nut and the, the, the nut is
00:13:21 flaky and delicious when you get to the core.
00:13:23 That was my, that was my contention with the video.
00:13:26 It seemed to be using Rick and Morty as an example
00:13:28 of the opposite, like a cynical show.
00:13:31 And I don't think so.
00:13:32 And it, it seemed like the whole video was sort of
00:13:35 giving off this false narrative of like there were
00:13:38 wholesome shows and then there was an era of cynical
00:13:41 shows and now we're getting back to wholesome again
00:13:43 when the fact is like we've always had both at the
00:13:45 same time and both have always been great in their own
00:13:48 ways.
00:13:49 Yeah, I think he definitely oversimplified, but we
00:13:51 can talk about the topics, you know, like the two
00:13:53 irony and sincerity outside of like the temporal
00:13:56 frame, you know, we can just talk about them in
00:13:57 general because I think, um, they're, they're
00:14:00 always going to be applicable like, uh, you know,
00:14:03 South Park, very, and it could, okay, because that's
00:14:06 the thing that, and this is what really is
00:14:07 interesting to me.
00:14:08 David Wallace was talking about how like irony is a
00:14:12 purely destructive force and that's what it is.
00:14:14 It takes things and it makes fun of them.
00:14:16 It shows how they're not important.
00:14:18 It points out how silly and ridiculous they can
00:14:20 be, uh, like, like Seinfeld does with like everyday
00:14:23 life in, you know, New York City or whatever.
00:14:25 Average like, uh, uh, getting to be middle-aged
00:14:28 man, living in a city, not so charmed as we
00:14:30 thought from all those fucking sitcoms of the
00:14:32 nineties and eighties and shit.
00:14:34 Uh, but, and I think that is a valuable tool, but
00:14:37 I personally am a big advocate for their being,
00:14:41 or at least I really enjoy when a story has,
00:14:44 like, it doesn't just break things down, but it
00:14:46 also builds something up.
00:14:48 Like, it does talk about how, okay, like, yeah,
00:14:51 living in New York City or whatever, like being a
00:14:53 Jew, not all it's cracked up to me, but, uh, but,
00:14:56 you know, like, like what Rick and Morty does,
00:14:59 like Rick and Morty is really the great thing,
00:15:01 because like, uh, the way that, uh, Rick, like in
00:15:04 one of the best episodes where he has that
00:15:05 relationship with a hive mind lady, what's her name,
00:15:08 uh, Felicity, Clarissa explains it all.
00:15:10 Yeah, I believe that was her name.
00:15:12 Uh, she, he has this like romantic involvement
00:15:15 with this, with this person and in, in contrast
00:15:18 to his normal devil may care attitude,
00:15:20 that episode is a really good job of showing
00:15:22 at the end how he like, even though he looks
00:15:24 like he's just like this fun loving guy who
00:15:26 doesn't give a fuck about anything, he actually
00:15:28 does like have some dependency on the
00:15:30 relationships he has and he feels a sincere
00:15:33 deep pain when like, she finally realizes that
00:15:36 like, you know, this guy is a destructive
00:15:38 force in my life, I need to be elsewhere.
00:15:40 And so, and then he tries to fucking kill himself
00:15:42 and it's, it's an incredibly emotional scene
00:15:44 that everybody loves and is, you know, one of
00:15:46 the famous ones from the show.
00:15:47 But the way that he's, he's like, that's not a
00:15:50 joke, like it's not a joke that, that Rick
00:15:52 tried to kill himself.
00:15:53 That is like a holy shit, like it is horrible
00:15:56 to be a human being who has these things
00:15:58 happen to him and we all experience it.
00:16:00 And so it's just like the super relatable
00:16:02 scene that I think is, is kind of, is one of
00:16:05 those teachable human experience moments,
00:16:08 you know, and uh, and that, that's the kind
00:16:10 of thing that I like to have at the, at
00:16:12 sort of the end of my arc of like comedy,
00:16:14 comedy, irreverence, and then at the end
00:16:16 it's like, oh yeah, you know, we're all,
00:16:17 we had a bunch of laughs, but there's,
00:16:19 there's some things that we need to think
00:16:21 about and seriously at the end of the day.
00:16:23 I'm sorry the mysterious winner entered,
00:16:25 but not every cartoon needs to have a moral.
00:16:27 I'm not saying they all need to, I'm just
00:16:29 saying that I really like what it does.
00:16:30 It's something that I like.
00:16:31 It's like a trope I like, but I think
00:16:33 that it's a tool.
00:16:34 I don't, uh, I don't agree that irony is
00:16:37 like inherently cynical or inherently like
00:16:41 not sincere.
00:16:43 I think that irony can be sincere.
00:16:44 I don't think they're opposites, because
00:16:46 like, have an example.
00:16:48 Yeah, like, um, like, uh, the room,
00:16:51 by the Tommy Wiseau movie.
00:16:53 Everybody sees it the first time,
00:16:55 and they, they want to like it ironically,
00:16:57 because it's so bad or whatever,
00:16:59 and so they're ironically enjoying it at first,
00:17:01 but then they're showing it to their friends,
00:17:03 and every time they show it to their friends,
00:17:04 they get that sincere enjoyment of like
00:17:07 showing this funny thing to everybody,
00:17:09 and they start to like it more.
00:17:10 And the next thing you know, you're having
00:17:11 parties, and you're all watching their
00:17:12 room together.
00:17:13 And the next thing you know, you're going
00:17:14 to a movie theater, and you're watching
00:17:15 the room in a movie theater, and it's like
00:17:16 an event with your friends, and it's no
00:17:18 longer like an ironic thing.
00:17:19 You're sincerely a fan of this terrible,
00:17:23 goofy, amazing film, The Room.
00:17:26 You know, I'm with you, dude, and I am
00:17:27 a huge Room fan.
00:17:29 Absolutely love the film.
00:17:30 Possibly my favorite movie of all time.
00:17:32 Yeah.
00:17:32 Um, but the thing is, and uh, oh boy,
00:17:35 this is going down a dark path.
00:17:36 Uh, I have to bring up, uh,
00:17:38 authorial intent.
00:17:39 A little bit, a little bit into this, uh...
00:17:41 Done, done, done!
00:17:44 It's just that, it's just that,
00:17:45 I wonder how important we should consider
00:17:48 when we're talking about like, okay,
00:17:49 like the message of a show or whatever.
00:17:51 Tommy Wiseau did not intend for people
00:17:54 to have that experience.
00:17:55 That is something that came from like the,
00:17:57 you know, the community that formed
00:17:59 around this like new understanding
00:18:00 of the work.
00:18:01 And Tommy Wiseau, like, now he's saying
00:18:03 that it's like a dark comedy, but at 100%
00:18:06 was not intended to be a dark comedy.
00:18:08 So those things, that's totally true.
00:18:10 I have a sincere, I legitimately love
00:18:13 that film and love the characters
00:18:15 in a, in a very real way, but it is not
00:18:18 what was like supposed to happen, you know.
00:18:21 So I just feel like the rules apply
00:18:23 slightly differently in a situation like that.
00:18:25 You know what I'm saying?
00:18:26 Is that fair?
00:18:29 Uh, maybe you're still gay.
00:18:30 I want to understand you.
00:18:33 If I could provide a more nuanced perspective
00:18:36 into this, I think I could really educate
00:18:37 you people on the true, the true meaning
00:18:42 of irony, I guess.
00:18:43 I want to agree with what Nate was saying
00:18:45 at the beginning.
00:18:46 One of these fucking dictionary thumpers.
00:18:49 I want to take it a step further and go
00:18:51 ahead and say that irony is, is a disgusting
00:18:53 bottom dwelling form of comedy.
00:18:56 And really irony and sarcasm is what,
00:18:59 it's, it's how 14 year old girls
00:19:00 communicate with each other.
00:19:02 So how can we as professional comedian
00:19:04 adults even consider irony to be something
00:19:07 that we should use in our arts, in our comedy?
00:19:10 I think it's really pathetic that we're
00:19:11 even discussing this.
00:19:12 Dumb, you're dumb.
00:19:13 That's like saying, that's like saying,
00:19:14 that's like saying a fart joke is always
00:19:16 inappropriate because it's low breath.
00:19:17 No, what monkey has never used irony or
00:19:20 sarcasm in his fucking videos.
00:19:21 I would never use irony.
00:19:22 I'm sincere.
00:19:23 I'm nearly on like a fucking higher plane
00:19:24 than us.
00:19:25 No, Monty knows what he's talking about.
00:19:27 I've always been wholesome in all my videos
00:19:29 and I kind of look down on anybody who
00:19:31 uses irony and sarcasm as a crutch for
00:19:33 their comedy.
00:19:33 Exactly.
00:19:34 This is funny because just and Nate
00:19:36 were being totally sincere.
00:19:38 I know.
00:19:38 And Monty and Monty would be totally ironic
00:19:40 and sarcastic.
00:19:41 I understood.
00:19:42 After that.
00:19:44 Woo!
00:19:45 Press one if you love Munchie and Monkey
00:19:47 separately, not the same person.
00:19:49 The same, the same guy, right?
00:19:50 Press one if you love that one guy.
00:19:51 No, damn it.
00:19:53 You know, speaking of Monkey and why I
00:19:55 hate him, and this is actually pertinent
00:19:57 to this topic, because I was having a
00:20:01 conversation, a debate with Monkey earlier
00:20:04 because I was watching one of his
00:20:05 Countdown to Suicide videos and he was
00:20:07 talking about, oh when Monkey's anime
00:20:10 reviews is over, I might just start a
00:20:12 series called Jimmy's Reviews so that
00:20:14 people know it's a more serious
00:20:17 reviews.
00:20:17 And I said, Monkey, you make me goddamn
00:20:20 sick.
00:20:20 First of all, coddling these parasites
00:20:23 by trying to make your channel more
00:20:25 accessible.
00:20:26 And second of all, how dare you put a
00:20:28 fucking a line of separation and say
00:20:30 this is the funny wacky satire videos
00:20:32 and these are the serious videos that
00:20:34 makes me so it makes me just just burn
00:20:37 with unbridled rage that anyone
00:20:40 would imply that there should be a
00:20:42 separation between the two.
00:20:43 You gotta, the best part about your
00:20:44 videos is that when there's a sincere
00:20:46 video, like an Elliot Roger video or a
00:20:48 bobo bobo video, that it's mixed in,
00:20:50 it's hidden in this sea of wacky
00:20:55 insanity with nothing to discern it at
00:20:58 a surface glance.
00:20:59 That's what makes it all the more
00:21:01 valid, even more valid than it would be
00:21:03 anyways, because you gotta have it
00:21:05 together.
00:21:05 You can't, I'm vehemently, violently
00:21:09 against the idea of making anything
00:21:11 accessible for these fucking rodents,
00:21:14 these leeches who watch the videos
00:21:16 and demand, no, you gotta take off your
00:21:18 mouth, you gotta have a human face,
00:21:20 Momke, you gotta be Jimmy and make
00:21:22 use for Jimmy.
00:21:23 Well, Jesse, is that mostly the reason
00:21:26 why you don't like the audience having
00:21:27 an easy time, like you don't want it to
00:21:29 be accessible?
00:21:29 Is that the only reason or is it just
00:21:31 part of the reason why?
00:21:32 I just plain don't like the audience, I
00:21:34 want them to be sad.
00:21:34 Alright, I understand.
00:21:36 I want them to not enjoy anything ever.
00:21:40 You know, that's, I see your point there,
00:21:42 and there's definitely something to be
00:21:44 gained by creating a danker cloud of
00:21:48 illusion to keep you fully understanding.
00:21:51 Maybe I'm completely misrepresenting
00:21:54 Momke's intention anyways, which I think
00:21:55 I am, but going with that asinine
00:21:59 example, I...
00:21:59 Yeah, if I can respond, Jess, I'm kind of
00:22:02 hurt because I think you're misinterpreting
00:22:05 really the point of all my videos.
00:22:07 As I said a second ago, I'm not trying to be
00:22:12 wacky or anything.
00:22:13 I've been sincere in every single video
00:22:15 I've made, so that you think that there's
00:22:17 such a line of distinction.
00:22:18 Oh, you're being ironic again!
00:22:19 I take back my apology!
00:22:21 You do get apology from me!
00:22:23 Fuck you!
00:22:25 You're trying to fucking satire me,
00:22:27 and I won't have it!
00:22:28 I invented satire, buddy!
00:22:31 This proves that irony is a purely
00:22:33 destructive force.
00:22:34 It corrodes the human soul!
00:22:40 Like about Hippo as the character
00:22:43 making his own like terrible videos that
00:22:46 are stupid because he's...
00:22:47 I love that idea.
00:22:48 But I was thinking of making it on another
00:22:50 channel, but I don't know whether
00:22:52 that's a good idea.
00:22:53 No, put it on Hippocrite.
00:22:54 I guess I should, but it's just...
00:22:56 Vito that, Vito that.
00:22:58 I am the number one advocate for Hippo.
00:23:00 The thing is, the thing is, I understand
00:23:03 there's an advantage just in general,
00:23:05 just for, I mean, I like it when
00:23:08 certain types of content are split up,
00:23:09 so I don't get annoyed when it's like,
00:23:11 you know, there's a guy I follow,
00:23:13 and then he's doing all this stuff,
00:23:14 and I'm like, yeah, I like this stuff,
00:23:15 and then he starts uploading stuff
00:23:17 that I don't like on that channel.
00:23:18 I'm like, well, okay,
00:23:21 it's just a...
00:23:22 I like separating channels.
00:23:23 I mean, we all have like multiple channels for things.
00:23:25 Yeah, but Hippo, what segment of your audience
00:23:27 wouldn't love a Hippo review?
00:23:29 Well, yeah, I mean, that's why.
00:23:31 That's true.
00:23:31 I guess to clarify my asinine point
00:23:34 about what I was saying about Mumki or whatever,
00:23:36 I don't even fucking remember what I was saying.
00:23:38 I just think that irony and sincerity
00:23:42 are both equally valid,
00:23:44 and they're all the more valid
00:23:45 when they can work in tandem
00:23:47 and be together as a delicious little stew,
00:23:51 as opposed to seeing it as opposites.
00:23:54 Well, I still have to disagree.
00:23:56 I have to go with Nate and say,
00:23:57 it's only valid and entertaining
00:23:59 if it has sincerity,
00:24:01 and if this stupid dumb cartoon
00:24:03 makes me cry at the end.
00:24:04 Otherwise, why would I even watch it?
00:24:05 Right, I see that you're making fun of me,
00:24:07 but you're not gonna get the nuances
00:24:09 of my point here, Mumki.
00:24:10 What I'm trying to say is that
00:24:12 what we're talking about here are two different things.
00:24:15 We're talking about two...
00:24:16 They're not opposites.
00:24:18 It's not like you can only have one or the other.
00:24:19 I'm talking about these are two tools
00:24:21 that every creator has in their toolbox
00:24:23 that they can utilize to whatever extents they want.
00:24:25 So it's like...
00:24:27 You know, when you're making something like
00:24:31 fucking a My Little Pony review,
00:24:34 like you can have a sincere opinion
00:24:36 that you're presenting in whatever way you want,
00:24:38 but you can also make fun of the fact
00:24:40 that you're watching this fucking show.
00:24:41 Did somebody say My Little Pony reviews?
00:24:44 It's me drowning in horseshoes.
00:24:46 Oh my God!
00:24:48 The original shitty, endless, just character.
00:24:50 A horseshoe good boy.
00:24:51 I...
00:24:52 Oh my God.
00:24:53 You know, that's...
00:24:56 Brony's are dumb and I don't like him.
00:24:58 Pope Corona is a guy he lives in my house, I guess.
00:25:02 Fuck you.
00:25:04 Goodbye.
00:25:06 Wow, that's real.
00:25:06 Nate.
00:25:07 Wow, you don't have to say never meet your heroes
00:25:09 because they'll always disappoint you.
00:25:10 But let me tell you, he did not disappoint.
00:25:14 That cameo was truly top game.
00:25:18 But Nate, real quick in response to your example,
00:25:20 I wasn't around during the dark times,
00:25:22 so please correct me if I'm wrong.
00:25:24 But aren't you doing a little bit of revisionist history there
00:25:27 saying, oh, I was watching ponies ironically, guys, all along.
00:25:30 No, no, no, no, no, no.
00:25:32 You're thinking, you're not, you're looking at
00:25:34 in too black and white of a picture
00:25:35 because there was nuance here all the time.
00:25:37 I legitimately loved that show for around four seasons.
00:25:41 I legitimately loved it.
00:25:42 At the same time, I was also aware
00:25:45 that there is this perception of people who watch the show
00:25:48 as artistic retards.
00:25:50 And I am able to both appreciate the show
00:25:52 and love every single aspect of the show itself
00:25:55 while also acknowledging and laughing at myself
00:25:58 for just being a part of this cultural phenomenon
00:26:01 where people think that it's just funny and stupid or whatever.
00:26:04 I have always maintained, even back during my pony days,
00:26:09 that the My Little Pony fandom, for all of its
00:26:12 faults and flaws of which there are many,
00:26:15 nevertheless, is more based more in sincerity
00:26:19 than it is in irony.
00:26:22 The fans absolutely.
00:26:22 And I maintain that to this day.
00:26:24 And then I myself, there's nothing ironic about it.
00:26:29 I still like My Little Pony.
00:26:31 I'm not as up to date with it as I once was.
00:26:34 I don't care as much as I once did.
00:26:36 But I still like it, sincerely.
00:26:39 I still to this day will watch some of the episodes
00:26:42 and ball my fucking eyes out at the sheer majesty.
00:26:46 Fucking, I don't need to go through every episode,
00:26:49 but I love the show.
00:26:50 It is a great show.
00:26:51 Some of the episodes are some of the best I've ever seen,
00:26:54 literally, some of the best I've ever seen.
00:26:55 And that's it.
00:26:57 And at the same time, I also find it amusing that I, you know,
00:27:01 let's just make this podcast a clip show
00:27:04 of like all of our favorite My Little Pony episodes.
00:27:06 Remember the time when the cutie markers sayers
00:27:09 finally got their cutie marks.
00:27:10 That's the best episode of the fucking show.
00:27:12 That is the best episode.
00:27:14 But, Nate, I'm still a little confused, Nate.
00:27:17 Are you fucking serious?
00:27:18 If you're giving a genuine review over it,
00:27:22 like just because you acknowledge that some bronies are bad,
00:27:25 how is that ironic that you're reviewing it
00:27:27 if you're being genuine with it?
00:27:29 Okay, you're obviously just trying to confuse,
00:27:32 I don't know.
00:27:33 I don't know why you're playing dumb at this point
00:27:35 because you obviously get it.
00:27:36 What's the irony in giving a sincere review of something?
00:27:41 Okay, here's the thing.
00:27:42 This could all be easily explained if you watched,
00:27:45 I don't know, Phantom Reviews or K-Reviews
00:27:48 or any of fucking Jesse's videos.
00:27:50 But he's not a real PCP members.
00:27:53 So he would never do that.
00:27:55 You should have known, monkey,
00:27:58 when we handed you the sealed golden envelope
00:28:01 containing your invitation to the PCP,
00:28:03 you should have known to do your research,
00:28:05 go back to the sacred texts and the ancient volumes
00:28:09 and go through the playlist of all of our separate sagas
00:28:13 together and separately and watch everything.
00:28:16 You, Rube, there is-
00:28:19 I can say sincerely that I didn't realize that,
00:28:23 I mean, I knew bronies were like lambasted for being like gay,
00:28:27 but I knew that it wasn't true because it was just a good show.
00:28:30 So when I started doing the reviews,
00:28:32 I was just doing it because it was a thing
00:28:34 that people in the community did.
00:28:36 I didn't really think of it too much as like,
00:28:38 you know, wow, this is really dumb
00:28:39 because it's like, I don't know.
00:28:41 People have been reviewing games and movies
00:28:42 and stuff from their childhood for a long time,
00:28:45 things that aren't necessarily for them.
00:28:48 I don't know.
00:28:48 It didn't seem as any any weirder than like that guy with the glasses.
00:28:53 In the video that I made,
00:28:55 Keg reviews putting your hoof down.
00:28:58 It opens, the video opens with a scene of Keg
00:29:02 talking about how he is a high schooler
00:29:05 and how just that day he had smashed innumerable puts.
00:29:08 All right.
00:29:09 That's what happens at the beginning of that episode.
00:29:12 And then he spends like 10 minutes
00:29:14 reviewing a fucking My Little Pony episode.
00:29:16 At the end of that video,
00:29:18 he then reveals that actually this entire thing was a lie.
00:29:21 He is actually a complete nerd,
00:29:23 or he was because this is a flashback.
00:29:25 He was a fucking nerd who everyone calls gay
00:29:27 because he doesn't have sex with women.
00:29:31 And then he spends that he then,
00:29:32 he then sincerely celebrates this show in the context of this review
00:29:36 for, you know, he met this character Iron Will.
00:29:38 It made him a real man.
00:29:39 Watching this episode of My Little Pony
00:29:41 made this character Keg a real man.
00:29:43 That is a both sincere and ironic way
00:29:45 to appreciate and interpret this episode.
00:29:48 And if you can't see that,
00:29:49 I don't know what to tell you, buddy,
00:29:51 because I can't feel any clearer than that.
00:29:52 I look down on irony so much
00:29:54 that I can't even recognize it anymore.
00:29:56 Fair enough.
00:29:57 We all have our disabilities.
00:29:59 Some of the motionability to others.
00:30:03 I wouldn't expect a fucking simian
00:30:07 to understand complex human emotions and concepts.
00:30:10 I think when it comes to comedy,
00:30:11 I'm standing way up here on a pillar
00:30:13 and all you people using irony for jokes
00:30:15 are like ants to me.
00:30:16 I can't even recognize what's happening down there.
00:30:18 I'm standing on a pillar, then I'm standing on the...
00:30:19 Oh, yes.
00:30:21 The bedside dresser on the duvet in the mattress.
00:30:24 I'm standing on the mattress.
00:30:25 I'm standing down inside of a manhole.
00:30:27 Monkey is the all-time greatest comedian.
00:30:30 We know that because the most impressive joke he ever did
00:30:35 was pointing out that he only has five jokes.
00:30:38 Yeah.
00:30:39 Yeah.
00:30:40 Very impressive.
00:30:40 There's nothing ironic about that.
00:30:41 It was a sincere joke.
00:30:42 As we've seen here on this podcast,
00:30:44 he is a master of the joke of pretending to be retarded.
00:30:47 He really knocks that one out of the...
00:30:49 Is he a master of it, though,
00:30:51 or is he just sincerely retarded?
00:30:55 The fact that we don't know proves his mastery.
00:30:58 That's, you know...
00:30:59 I hope you guys are being ironic
00:31:01 because this is sincerely hurting my feelings.
00:31:04 This is the worst conversation ever.
00:31:06 Everyone's just starting to fucking out irony each other
00:31:08 and nothing makes any goddamn sense.
00:31:10 I haven't said anything ironic
00:31:12 because I'm the only good boy.
00:31:15 That's true.
00:31:15 Hashtag good boy.
00:31:17 Okay, but see, that's interesting.
00:31:19 We didn't get into the nuance,
00:31:20 but I wanted to clarify how before when I said that
00:31:22 like irony is a destructive tool,
00:31:24 that's not me criticizing it.
00:31:25 That is just me pointing out that what irony is
00:31:28 is making fun of something.
00:31:29 Which is a purely destructive act.
00:31:31 There is nothing being built.
00:31:34 I think making fun of somebody to be constructed.
00:31:36 It's like, could you call Dynamite a construction tool?
00:31:37 No, it's a demolition tool.
00:31:38 You could.
00:31:39 Yeah, you need...
00:31:40 Oh, shut the fuck up.
00:31:42 If you need to build a railway through a mountain,
00:31:45 you use Dynamite.
00:31:46 But that's exactly my point.
00:31:47 It is a tool you use to get rid of something
00:31:49 so that then you can come in with other tools
00:31:51 to build something up there.
00:31:52 So if I'm going around and I'm saying like,
00:31:54 oh, you know, women are all retarded and gay.
00:31:59 I'm saying that.
00:32:00 And then someone says like,
00:32:01 look at me, women are retarded and gay.
00:32:03 Look at that guy, he's so gay.
00:32:04 This is me mocking him.
00:32:05 That's me, you know, making fun of that guy
00:32:07 to destroy his argument with my hilarious joke.
00:32:10 Which is what he just said in a retarded voice.
00:32:13 So that someone then can later on suppose like,
00:32:15 you know what, maybe women aren't all retarded and gay.
00:32:17 And then one's like, yeah, I'm with that guy.
00:32:19 That guy would be an idiot.
00:32:21 But like, okay, the fucking Dynamite analogy.
00:32:26 Is Dynamite not still then valuable
00:32:29 and should be cherished for doing its job
00:32:32 into help create a better future?
00:32:35 Of course, which is why, yeah, we are nebulous topic.
00:32:40 Can we just talk about like what animes we like
00:32:43 some time on this fucking show?
00:32:45 Didn't this used to be a show about like fun stuff?
00:32:47 Jesse, you hated anime.
00:32:48 No, we do.
00:32:48 You hate anime more than anyone I've ever met, Jesse.
00:32:51 What are you saying to me right now?
00:32:53 Now all we do is have these weird circular philosophical
00:32:57 discussions about the fucking nature of art and reality
00:33:00 and our place in the universe.
00:33:02 And I can't take it anymore.
00:33:03 It's making me too smart.
00:33:05 My brain's gonna explode.
00:33:07 You're wind too intelligent for the PCP.
00:33:12 I'm gonna ascend beyond my mortal human body
00:33:16 before I wanted to.
00:33:18 I'm not done cooking yet.
00:33:20 If it happens prematurely,
00:33:21 it'll be bad for the universe.
00:33:23 The PCP is like Aang
00:33:25 when he was opening his eight chakras
00:33:27 and we're about, we're right at the stage
00:33:29 before that cosmic chakra.
00:33:30 We're right there.
00:33:31 We need to, we can't, we can't.
00:33:33 We're fucking asleep to a high level of Christ consciousness.
00:33:35 That's right.
00:33:35 We can't leave Katara just yet.
00:33:37 I'm not ready.
00:33:38 I'm not ready.
00:33:38 I'm too goddamn strong in this podcast.
00:33:40 Oh my god.
00:33:41 If we go too far, we will lose all attachments
00:33:43 to both earthly desires.
00:33:47 Which just means my piss has been released from my body.
00:33:51 No.
00:33:52 I can't stop it.
00:33:53 My cock is turning into a lemon pie.
00:33:58 The lies.
00:33:59 Do you think it would be good if we discussed that?
00:34:00 Now you know the truth.
00:34:01 I'm actually a level eight Christ consciousness bee.
00:34:05 That's why I'm so powerful.
00:34:08 Oh my god.
00:34:08 Get in the fuck out of here.
00:34:09 Before this goes to a complete clusterfuck,
00:34:11 I was gonna ask,
00:34:11 since all five of us have created things before,
00:34:14 should we talk about the ways in which we have used irony
00:34:16 and sincerity within the things we've created
00:34:18 that all of our loving fans watch and enjoy?
00:34:22 Please.
00:34:23 Please.
00:34:23 I don't want to start.
00:34:26 I already gave an example.
00:34:28 Yeah.
00:34:28 I'll give an example of the irony in my art
00:34:30 that I haven't made yet.
00:34:30 No, god damn it.
00:34:31 Hippo was saying something.
00:34:32 I want to hear Hippo.
00:34:33 Well, I was just going to say I'm not smart
00:34:35 and I don't know what I do.
00:34:38 I don't know whether it's sincere or ironic.
00:34:40 I just, I like video games and I say this is a good one.
00:34:43 That's perfectly fine.
00:34:44 I like the way you do things.
00:34:45 And sometimes you can't tell if it's sincere or ironic.
00:34:48 That's great.
00:34:49 I really like that.
00:34:50 I don't know either.
00:34:51 I'm probably sincere the whole time, but I don't know.
00:34:54 Remember, you're opening to the Driver 2 video
00:34:56 where it just shows you rocking out to that fucking song.
00:35:01 That is both funny because it's silly
00:35:03 and also I'm sure that you just like that song
00:35:06 because I fucking like that song.
00:35:08 Yeah.
00:35:08 So it's that kind of middle ground.
00:35:10 Well, I think it's just that I make fun of myself
00:35:14 because I'm lame, but when I do silly things,
00:35:19 it's not because I'm ironically enjoying anything
00:35:22 or I'm just trying to say, yeah, this is silly.
00:35:24 I'm just trying to say that I'm silly
00:35:26 and this is how I react sincerely to things that I like.
00:35:31 Like what in your other video for the Fire Emblem,
00:35:33 we're at the end.
00:35:34 Oh, guys, this is my favorite.
00:35:34 When you're playing all the Florina voice clips
00:35:37 and then at the end, you just make that face at the very end.
00:35:39 You're like, ooh, and then it ends.
00:35:43 I've watched that like 20 times.
00:35:45 This is my favorite.
00:35:46 I have a question in reference to Hippo's comedy
00:35:49 because I think a lot of the times he'll do a joke
00:35:51 that is intentionally really bad,
00:35:53 but like it's still really funny.
00:35:55 So does that count as an ironic joke
00:35:57 because it's bad on purpose
00:35:58 or is it a sincere joke because it's sincerely funny too?
00:36:03 There's a, I think there's two ways those happen.
00:36:07 One is that I write a joke and it sucks,
00:36:09 but I don't realize it until I'm recording it
00:36:11 and then in editing, try to make it funny by timing it right.
00:36:17 Other times, I don't know.
00:36:19 I think I'm just not good at making some jokes.
00:36:22 I'm not sure.
00:36:23 No, but I think even in improv,
00:36:26 you just, you say really dumb things in a funny way
00:36:29 on purpose all the time.
00:36:31 And it's really funny to me.
00:36:32 Yeah, you say a lot of stupid shit.
00:36:34 Yeah, and I think what we're saying is
00:36:37 we're going to kick you out of the PCP.
00:36:38 Oh, I think I start with Travis.
00:36:40 We're on a roll lately.
00:36:41 They're dropping like flies these days.
00:36:44 So we're down to just this five now.
00:36:48 Everyone else is dead.
00:36:49 The five's best going to be the end of Taylor.
00:36:51 So, I mean, did anybody have any specific ironic jokes?
00:36:54 I want to hear Jess give me his spiel
00:36:56 because he's very passionate about this.
00:36:58 I am a man with many a spiel, that is true.
00:37:03 You know, I think that, I think all my content
00:37:06 is pretty much completely sincere all the time.
00:37:11 I mean, maybe more than people realize,
00:37:13 like maybe like 300% sincere.
00:37:17 That's a lot.
00:37:19 I think, you know, like my message is sincere.
00:37:23 My everything is sincere.
00:37:25 The only thing that's ironic occasionally
00:37:27 is like my delivery is ironic.
00:37:29 But even when my delivery is ironic,
00:37:31 all the other stuff behind it
00:37:33 and swirling around it is still sincere.
00:37:37 I value sincerity a lot, a lot.
00:37:40 Wait, how did, I guess I'm just dumb
00:37:44 because I don't know what it means
00:37:45 to have an ironic way to tell something sincerely.
00:37:47 I don't either.
00:37:48 This is a dumb topic and I don't like it.
00:37:50 I don't get it.
00:37:52 Well, whatever.
00:37:54 For example, I mean, the only time,
00:37:56 I mean, the times when I like my videos
00:37:58 are like the most ironic, I guess,
00:38:01 are like stuff with the kayfabe commander.
00:38:07 Because like...
00:38:07 Well, those aren't sincere.
00:38:08 What the fuck?
00:38:09 Oh no, the message behind the kayfabe commander
00:38:12 is very sincere.
00:38:13 He's really strong.
00:38:14 He'll beat you up.
00:38:14 He's like the evil.
00:38:16 All of his opinions are undoubtedly the worst.
00:38:19 Right.
00:38:19 But like the philosophy behind those skits
00:38:25 when I first started incorporating that character
00:38:28 was because I was just genuinely so like worn out
00:38:32 from like years of like trying to do YouTube good.
00:38:36 That like with the kayfabe commander,
00:38:38 it's just like I just want this to be blatantly obviously
00:38:43 not like not even trying.
00:38:44 So like whenever you see the kayfabe commander
00:38:46 in one of my videos,
00:38:48 nothing involving the kayfabe commander
00:38:51 is ever scripted or written.
00:38:54 I just let him come out and fucking ramble.
00:38:56 And then I ramble and I always,
00:38:58 I deliberately put on this like bad acting,
00:39:02 acting because I think that in the past,
00:39:05 I've shown myself to be a somewhat capable actor
00:39:08 when I actually try.
00:39:09 But whenever it's a dumb skit like that now,
00:39:13 for me, it's more funny to just like blatantly put
00:39:16 like no enthusiasm in it.
00:39:18 Like, oh God, the fucking kayfabe commander,
00:39:22 he's here again or some shit.
00:39:24 Just like leave like flubs in and just have him over there.
00:39:26 Like, I'm gonna suck a thousand dicks today
00:39:29 and then beat you up and then suck more dicks
00:39:32 and beat you up again.
00:39:33 It's just, I love it when you do that.
00:39:36 Those are great.
00:39:37 Jess, we were talking about this very thing
00:39:39 on My Spyro Let's Play.
00:39:40 And you said that you're sort of trying to go
00:39:42 for a parody of people like Movie Bob
00:39:45 who would throw in just retarded skits
00:39:48 into their review videos
00:39:49 and just kind of playing off of that.
00:39:51 Yeah, exactly.
00:39:52 So I can see how irony is being both
00:39:55 constructive and destructive.
00:39:57 It's a sincere satirical point,
00:40:01 but it has to be delivered ironically
00:40:04 because that is the point, I guess.
00:40:06 Yeah.
00:40:07 And if you're a fan of those,
00:40:09 and if you're a fan of those terrible skits,
00:40:12 oh boy, have I got an extra terrible one coming soon.
00:40:15 It might be out in a time you hear this.
00:40:18 I kind of want to make skits that are sincere,
00:40:22 like actually emotional, like because most of the time
00:40:26 they're playful laughs, whether they're ironic or not.
00:40:29 Yee.
00:40:30 I don't know.
00:40:30 Dude, frankly, it's way harder to make sincere ones
00:40:33 than ironic ones.
00:40:33 Oh, definitely.
00:40:34 This is like a thousand times harder.
00:40:36 That's why Monkey so puts so much work in his videos
00:40:38 because he has to make everything so sincere and passionate.
00:40:41 Yeah, I work really hard to make sure
00:40:43 it's not like ham-fisted or corny.
00:40:45 I have to make everything as sincere as I can.
00:40:48 I mean, the production value on Monkey's anti-reviews
00:40:51 is just so fucking out of this world.
00:40:53 I'm surprised he has any free time to record the PCP.
00:40:56 I really don't.
00:40:57 He's just fucking hammering out shit, dude.
00:40:59 Well, Monkey's young.
00:41:00 He still has that work ethic that I once had,
00:41:04 that many of us, I'm sure, once had.
00:41:06 But he'll be cured of that soon enough.
00:41:11 Thank God.
00:41:11 You know, I was thinking...
00:41:12 My favorite Monkey universe character is Grandma.
00:41:15 She's...
00:41:17 She's...
00:41:17 There's that bit of sincerity, you know?
00:41:19 Where'd you get the Grandma mask, by the way?
00:41:21 Where'd you get that whole Grandma from?
00:41:23 I find them in parts.
00:41:24 I can't put together a whole one yet.
00:41:25 I went on Craig's list and I said I'm looking for a Grandma
00:41:28 for these videos and she volunteered.
00:41:30 That's awesome.
00:41:31 Excellent.
00:41:31 That's beautiful.
00:41:33 Wait, is that actually true?
00:41:34 Yeah, yeah, that's not my real Grandma.
00:41:36 I just found her on Craig's list.
00:41:37 What?
00:41:37 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
00:41:39 Is that actually real?
00:41:40 Are you telling me that that being did not spring forth
00:41:44 from your furnace room?
00:41:46 I'm not gonna show my real Grandma all that weird anime porn,
00:41:49 should I just found some actress online?
00:41:52 Oh my God, I had no...
00:41:53 Okay, okay.
00:41:53 Wow, that's a bombshell.
00:41:54 Stop the meming for just a second.
00:41:56 Is that actually...
00:41:58 Is that...
00:41:58 Is that real?
00:41:59 Of course.
00:42:01 Oh, he's fucking with us.
00:42:03 He's fucking with us.
00:42:03 He's being too ironic right now.
00:42:04 I don't know.
00:42:05 I really don't know.
00:42:05 I already fucking strained the PCP.
00:42:07 I told you it's a destructive force.
00:42:09 It's like...
00:42:09 It's like my power level is so...
00:42:12 You know, hey, what ironic thing I think, Jesse,
00:42:15 is that I think over the years you and I specifically
00:42:19 have tried to make really good videos
00:42:23 and ironically, those were really bad YouTube videos.
00:42:27 Yeah, yeah, that's a...
00:42:28 Yeah, that's a true thing.
00:42:30 Don't make that mistake, folks.
00:42:32 Be a shale.
00:42:32 Be a hack.
00:42:33 Make garbage like monkey.
00:42:35 Monkey's doing it all right.
00:42:36 Monkey's kind of straight from the get-go.
00:42:39 Wait, so, Ben, are you...
00:42:41 I mean, I'm Nate.
00:42:42 Sorry.
00:42:42 Are you all right?
00:42:43 Wait, just go, Ben.
00:42:45 I am not a worm.
00:42:46 I am not the scum of the earth.
00:42:48 I am not a little piece of shit, all right?
00:42:51 You will never do that again to me.
00:42:52 You're just both so suck and similar.
00:42:54 You're just like the same person, baby.
00:42:55 Shut up, monkey.
00:42:56 I don't even like you.
00:43:00 All right, what's your question, buddy boy?
00:43:01 Are you saying you're not a hack fraud in every way, Ben?
00:43:04 Oh, I'm saying that I'm doing my best to become a hack fraud.
00:43:06 You know, I've been releasing your comic on time.
00:43:08 Seriously.
00:43:10 Wait, what?
00:43:10 You're not even releasing your comic on a fucking insistent basis.
00:43:14 Shut up!
00:43:14 I don't do comics.
00:43:16 That's not me.
00:43:17 I'm not a comic guy.
00:43:19 The only guys who are gay do comics.
00:43:21 The only guy who's a comic guy is Piccolo.
00:43:25 I don't.
00:43:25 Are you talking about that comic?
00:43:26 No, wait, that's NAMIC.
00:43:27 I fucked it up.
00:43:28 What's comic from?
00:43:29 Comic is the, well, comic was the...
00:43:32 God damn it, I don't remember.
00:43:33 I don't remember either.
00:43:34 Dragon Ball Z is gay, because it's from Japan.
00:43:37 It's from Japan, so it's gay, it's bad.
00:43:39 All right, I don't know what the fucking Nate's point was,
00:43:42 which was a good point before it got fucking derailed.
00:43:45 Yeah.
00:43:45 But fucking Piccolo and whatever.
00:43:49 Um...
00:43:53 Yeah, I mean, I fucking...
00:43:55 Like, I don't ever want a video on my channel ever again
00:43:59 that's over 10 minutes long,
00:44:01 because it's just the wrong way to do it.
00:44:03 It's bad.
00:44:04 Well, hey, doing it just at 10 minutes is good,
00:44:06 because then you could put an ad at the end,
00:44:08 and you gotta do that.
00:44:09 Like, some of the stuff I've been doing more recently,
00:44:12 like some of the better fuck videos
00:44:14 are like the Not A Review series.
00:44:16 Like, those are great.
00:44:18 Almost no effort goes into those,
00:44:20 and there are a million times better YouTube videos
00:44:22 than stuff I used to work on day and night for 40 hours.
00:44:27 I just didn't know.
00:44:29 I didn't know how to play the game back then.
00:44:31 I still don't, but maybe I'll learn someday.
00:44:36 My Kingdom Hearts videos are my attempt to do that,
00:44:38 and it's so easy.
00:44:41 It's so...
00:44:42 I didn't realize it could be this easy.
00:44:43 It's insanity, and it's what people want.
00:44:46 You know, it's what YouTube wants, at least.
00:44:48 It's crazy.
00:44:50 So, I guess sincerity is strong.
00:44:52 I'm still struggling with being able to not do big things.
00:44:57 It's just, you know?
00:45:00 I think we're growing, you know?
00:45:02 I think we're learning the game a little bit.
00:45:03 We're becoming pros on this pro-crastinators podcast.
00:45:07 You're witnessing it, folks.
00:45:08 It's funny.
00:45:08 You're witnessing a chrysalis bursting
00:45:10 into a beautiful boober fly with big, saggy tits.
00:45:14 Really great point, Phantom Horn.
00:45:16 Anyway, to continue.
00:45:17 SHUT THEM!
00:45:21 It's funny, because my comic I'm working on now
00:45:23 is fairly big, but I've always had the philosophy
00:45:25 that just a ton of small things is good,
00:45:28 and I like that more than big things.
00:45:28 That's why web comics with more or less daily releases
00:45:31 are quickly home stuck.
00:45:32 It was popular with that.
00:45:33 Release in one panel.
00:45:35 Well, I don't mean like that.
00:45:36 I'm not directly like Steven Bombs in the release schedule.
00:45:41 But having small, contained stories that go on
00:45:45 for just as long as they need to,
00:45:47 and then have a definitive ending,
00:45:49 that you can wrap up in a neat little bow
00:45:51 that has a nice cover and you would pick them
00:45:53 in a bookstore, I like that.
00:45:55 I used to want to make every video like,
00:45:57 I'm going to review this thing.
00:45:59 So I'm going to make a huge, in-depth, sprawling,
00:46:02 30-minute review analysis,
00:46:04 and I'm going to touch on every little,
00:46:06 tiny aspect of it in the ultimate video.
00:46:08 And because that's the way I approached making videos,
00:46:11 well, what happened is,
00:46:12 either the video would never get around to being made
00:46:15 because it would become too massive in the writing phase,
00:46:18 or I would miraculously get the video made,
00:46:21 and nobody would watch it
00:46:22 because it was a giant 30-minute,
00:46:24 non-marketable piece of shit.
00:46:28 The correct way to do it, I now understand,
00:46:31 is instead of making a massive video touching on everything,
00:46:34 you just make little videos about the specific subjects,
00:46:38 and you can make as many of those as you want.
00:46:40 You can make them in a fucking day,
00:46:42 and you can have hundreds of them out every day forever,
00:46:45 and everyone wants to watch them,
00:46:46 and that's how you become a real boy.
00:46:49 Yeah, it seems to be that there is still like a market
00:46:53 for huge videos,
00:46:54 but they have to be spectacularly huge
00:46:58 in order to get a lot of views,
00:46:59 like Mathematosis doing like a 40-minute review
00:47:04 of Mario 64, and then a review of every other Mario.
00:47:08 Like they have to be huge, or they have to be tiny.
00:47:11 You can't really sort of make a 30-minute, 20-minute...
00:47:13 You know, I was looking at some old documents of mine,
00:47:17 and looking at stuff I never finished,
00:47:19 and I found this old massive, massive,
00:47:23 Mass Effect 3 analysis that I wrote when it came out.
00:47:26 This giant, this rage-fueled tirade of a review,
00:47:32 and it was like a million pages long,
00:47:36 and it touched on everything.
00:47:37 Like, oh, the ending is bad,
00:47:40 and Tally's face reveal is bad, and this is bad,
00:47:42 but I never got around to making the video,
00:47:45 because it became too much.
00:47:47 I wrote too much, but now I'm looking at it
00:47:50 in my old documents, and I'm going,
00:47:53 you know, I could still make a video
00:47:56 about why Tally's face reveal still makes me mad,
00:47:59 or a video about why the ending still makes me mad.
00:48:02 I could chop it up into these little segments,
00:48:04 and it would love that Tally's face one.
00:48:06 Like, I could easily do that, and instead of one Mass Effect video
00:48:10 that nobody watches, because it's an hour long,
00:48:12 I could have 10 Mass Effect 3 videos that everybody watches,
00:48:16 because they're easy and accessible,
00:48:17 and brilliant and nice and fun,
00:48:19 and works better with the YouTube algorithm.
00:48:21 It's better in literally every way.
00:48:23 You know, I think I've been trying to do that with the Rayman.
00:48:26 Once I've finished part three,
00:48:29 any other big video is going to be in parts,
00:48:31 and then later I'll stitch it together into one video,
00:48:34 so it will come out slowly, but not too slowly.
00:48:39 Ooh, I like that idea of stitching them together later
00:48:41 into one video for the people who want to see it.
00:48:43 That's a good idea.
00:48:45 I agree with everything you guys are saying,
00:48:47 but I think the one needle in the haystack,
00:48:49 just specifically for you guys, is that it's the Patreon.
00:48:53 It's that you charge people per video.
00:48:54 So, you want to make something that's big and grand
00:48:57 to justify charging them.
00:48:58 If you make 100 small videos, you might have some problems.
00:49:02 You know what I'm saying?
00:49:03 I can confirm that most people don't care.
00:49:07 Well, they definitely don't want Jesse.
00:49:09 People have proved they will pay Jesse for anything.
00:49:11 It doesn't matter.
00:49:15 The good thing about Patreon is that,
00:49:18 as you make more videos in the month,
00:49:20 the people who've capped increases.
00:49:23 So, you can make eight videos,
00:49:26 and by the eighth video, you're not really ripping anyone off
00:49:29 because the only people who aren't capped
00:49:31 are people who are like $1 pledgers at that point,
00:49:33 so no one really fucking cares.
00:49:36 Anything I make is worth $1, so...
00:49:40 The people who are pledging $5 or $10
00:49:43 are only getting charged once or twice.
00:49:47 I feel pretty strongly about this.
00:49:48 There's some discussion I hear about what you owe
00:49:52 your patrons and stuff, but I really, truly feel
00:49:55 the responsibility, if I post a garbage video
00:49:59 and I charge for it, I sincerely feel
00:50:01 it is the responsibility of the patrons to watch that
00:50:05 and determine if it is something
00:50:06 that is deserving of their money or not.
00:50:07 And don't get me wrong.
00:50:08 There is a level of trust that you have to maintain,
00:50:11 but I'm just saying, this shouldn't be thought of as like,
00:50:14 I am like an icon of virtue, and as a patron guy,
00:50:21 I always make great shit.
00:50:23 And then if I break that contract,
00:50:24 it's like I have committed a grievous sin.
00:50:27 I don't like to think about it that way.
00:50:28 I like to think about it in terms of market forces.
00:50:30 Am I supplying a product that people are willing to pay for?
00:50:33 If so, they will give me money.
00:50:34 If I betray the market expectations,
00:50:37 I will be penalized because people will stop patroning me.
00:50:40 I just really don't like this whole idea
00:50:42 of lionizing the Patreon creators,
00:50:45 as if they're so perfect all the time.
00:50:47 When they're really just people trying to survive
00:50:50 doing what they're doing.
00:50:51 That's the anxiety I've had.
00:50:56 I haven't had a lot of people leave,
00:50:59 but there's been occasionally just one person
00:51:01 like go from five dollars to one dollar,
00:51:02 and that's enough to make me go,
00:51:04 oh no, I've ruined everything.
00:51:06 My reputation's gone.
00:51:09 I'm homeless now.
00:51:11 We should definitely add to all this discussion,
00:51:13 the caveat or the disclaimer.
00:51:15 Don't anybody unpledged from us ever?
00:51:18 Don't anyone?
00:51:18 Never.
00:51:19 Don't do it.
00:51:19 Don't unpledge.
00:51:20 We need your money to stay alive,
00:51:22 especially me.
00:51:22 I sleep in garbage.
00:51:23 My life is hell.
00:51:24 Don't unpledge.
00:51:25 Don't edit your pledge lower.
00:51:26 Don't do it.
00:51:27 I'll die.
00:51:28 I'll die.
00:51:29 I'll die.
00:51:29 Jess is a sewer priest and ghetto spiritualist.
00:51:33 He needs your money more than anybody.
00:51:36 Yeah, it's just like real priests.
00:51:37 But by the way, all of us, excluding monkey,
00:51:40 use irony to some extent in our work,
00:51:42 but we all sincerely want your money.
00:51:45 So please go into the most sincere Patreon in the world.
00:51:51 Yeah.
00:51:52 If you want to support this podcast,
00:51:53 PAPES, go to, I think the URL is going to be
00:51:56 patreon.com slash theprocrastinators.
00:51:58 There'll be a link.
00:51:59 Look out the screen.
00:51:59 You're going to be up for this video?
00:52:01 What?
00:52:02 We'll be up for this video.
00:52:02 It's going to be out for the last video, actually,
00:52:04 but it's in this one too.
00:52:05 Oh, so we're not going to pay?
00:52:06 Can you haven't even pledged yet?
00:52:08 Yeah, man.
00:52:08 The payments will begin if you people pledge,
00:52:11 which I know you will.
00:52:12 You wouldn't betray me like that, fam, would you?
00:52:14 Would you, fam?
00:52:15 You wouldn't get on Ben's bad side like that, would you?
00:52:18 Shut up!
00:52:19 You're on my bad side, dad!
00:52:21 Fucking bitch!
00:52:22 Now, if you're thinking folks at home,
00:52:24 if you're thinking, I can't afford to pledge
00:52:26 the procrastinators Patreon,
00:52:27 all you have to do is unsub from BenSaint
00:52:29 and put that money into the PCP.
00:52:32 Yeah, that's the way to do it.
00:52:33 We have been championing patreon.com slash BenSaint
00:52:36 for too long.
00:52:36 It's time to take our cut.
00:52:38 It's had a rebar reward for propagating the stuff.
00:52:41 Pay what he owe.
00:52:42 That's exactly right.
00:52:45 Now, as we round the one hour mark on my record here,
00:52:49 let's just talk about how much Seinfeld is the best ever.
00:52:54 Seinfeld is really good, and it's the best ever.
00:52:58 There we go.
00:52:58 Am I wrong in thinking that...
00:53:01 Well, you should definitely watch it, dude.
00:53:02 It's great, even now.
00:53:03 Am I wrong in thinking...
00:53:04 Should I start at act five or not?
00:53:09 You don't even know, because there actually is people like that
00:53:11 for fucking like season four,
00:53:12 because that's when the show picks up.
00:53:15 Watch from the beginning.
00:53:16 Yeah, there is a tiny bit of continuity,
00:53:18 and it's all great.
00:53:19 So there's like no reason to skip it.
00:53:20 There is a lot of continuity.
00:53:22 Actually, I've been rewatching it on like fucking like kissanime.com.
00:53:29 I go to put locker.
00:53:30 I wasn't put locker.
00:53:32 Fuck yeah.
00:53:33 Am I wrong, guys, in thinking that Lethal Aurora Mage,
00:53:36 or Mage, as you might know her,
00:53:38 did she learn English from Seinfeld?
00:53:39 I can't remember who was that or something else.
00:53:41 No, she's from anime or cartoons.
00:53:43 Somebody else I know learned English from Seinfeld.
00:53:45 That's...
00:53:46 I can't remember me.
00:53:47 I'm gonna be best friends with that person.
00:53:50 Post in the comments if you learned English from Seinfeld.
00:53:53 A straw poll.
00:53:54 Did we learn English?
00:53:56 Press one.
00:53:57 At all, not from Seinfeld.
00:53:59 Yeah, press one.
00:54:00 Press one.
00:54:01 A straw poll.
00:54:03 Are Jesse's Donald Trump tweets funny,
00:54:06 because Nate doesn't get them.
00:54:07 No, no, no.
00:54:10 I stand with it involved in my hilarious...
00:54:13 My groundbreaking Trump tweets.
00:54:15 Nate just doesn't get it.
00:54:16 He's a little baby.
00:54:18 I would say that it is true.
00:54:20 My complaint with them is that I do not find them funny,
00:54:23 and I find them annoying.
00:54:24 Nate, do we have any Twitter questions today?
00:54:27 No, no, I have one more point about Seinfeld.
00:54:30 From the age I was like one until I was like 10 or 12,
00:54:34 that was literally the only TV show I watched.
00:54:38 That's not a joke.
00:54:39 You didn't watch Will and Grace?
00:54:41 I thought that, you know...
00:54:43 I actually watched a bit of The Golden Girls,
00:54:44 but other than that, just Seinfeld.
00:54:47 Wow, amazing.
00:54:49 Is that because your family is big Christ fags?
00:54:51 No, it's because they're really big Jew fags.
00:54:52 They only let you watch Jewish, right?
00:54:54 Jew fags, right, okay, okay.
00:54:56 I feel like we completely got off the topic,
00:54:58 and so shall we just go to questions now?
00:54:59 There's a shit topic, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:55:00 Yeah, let's go to...
00:55:01 No, I thought the topic was good.
00:55:02 I liked it.
00:55:03 Me too.
00:55:04 I'm saying that with all sincerity.
00:55:06 Yeah, the final final opportunity.
00:55:08 Anybody got any last points to make on sincerity,
00:55:11 irony, any of that shit?
00:55:13 I think if you use it as a crutch,
00:55:15 you should just kill yourself.
00:55:17 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
00:55:18 Yeah, that makes sense.
00:55:19 Good.
00:55:20 Yeah.
00:55:21 Okay, all right, I got questions here.
00:55:23 Now remember, everybody, go to Twitter,
00:55:25 follow at TPCrastinators,
00:55:27 and send us fucking questions throughout the week.
00:55:29 And when we record these on Saturday,
00:55:31 I always fucking tweet to send us questions,
00:55:33 and then we're gonna answer them here.
00:55:34 Well, we're sorry that these past two episodes
00:55:36 have been really, really bad.
00:55:37 I think it's because I've been on both,
00:55:39 and I'm leaving the PCP.
00:55:41 It's basically like this.
00:55:42 Okay.
00:55:43 So it's been a send off episode.
00:55:45 Hey, while we're plugging stuff,
00:55:46 can we talk about the Wiki
00:55:48 that everybody should go check out?
00:55:49 We did mention it, but feel free to mention it again.
00:55:52 I don't know what the website's called,
00:55:53 but go check out the Wiki.
00:55:54 It's procrastopedia.mirahees.com,
00:55:58 I want to say.
00:55:59 There'll be a link in the description.
00:56:00 I added it to the description for the last one,
00:56:02 and it'll be there from now on.
00:56:04 But yeah, everybody, go add to the Procrastopedia,
00:56:07 the PCP Wiki.
00:56:08 We got fucking shit.
00:56:09 We need troops to go in and add meaningful lore
00:56:13 to the various pages I just made,
00:56:14 the Action Giraffe page today.
00:56:16 We need to add more to it.
00:56:17 I made the illustrious Undertale 5.8.7 page,
00:56:22 and it's beautiful.
00:56:23 Is the Wiki gonna have cliff notes
00:56:26 of episodes of the podcast?
00:56:29 Yeah.
00:56:29 You can link to all the information that you provide.
00:56:32 I don't think I've seen links of what specific episodes
00:56:35 are about, but that could be a section
00:56:37 somebody could add, certainly.
00:56:38 It could be whatever we want to add to it,
00:56:40 or whatever people want to add to it.
00:56:41 I think they should add links to the references,
00:56:44 otherwise it's too much of an in-joke.
00:56:46 Nobody's really going to get it coming from the outside.
00:56:49 I guess.
00:56:50 I like that feeling that you need to jump in and ride
00:56:53 for a while before you understand what's going on.
00:56:55 Yeah, but if we keep talking about a joke
00:56:57 and somebody wants to go see what the fuck that joke means,
00:57:00 and then the Wiki page for it is a bunch of more in-jokes,
00:57:03 they're not going to learn a damn thing.
00:57:05 If we have a list of the memes and in-jokes,
00:57:07 and then a link to whether it originated.
00:57:09 Right.
00:57:09 It should work like TV tropes, where there'll be a thing
00:57:12 and it'll be like, oh, Undertailer,
00:57:13 I don't know what the fuck that is.
00:57:14 Oh, I go to his page, and now I know all the lore.
00:57:16 There you go.
00:57:18 That makes sense to me.
00:57:19 And appearances, they can watch the episode
00:57:20 if they want to know where the fuck he came from,
00:57:22 any of that shit.
00:57:23 Yeah, that's a cool idea.
00:57:24 Well, my backstory is very long and complicated.
00:57:26 Let's try this in the Unteller 5H7 podcast.
00:57:30 I was a wee boy, and get the fuck out of here.
00:57:32 Get out, stop recording raps.
00:57:34 This is my house.
00:57:35 Get out.
00:57:37 OK, what are the questions, Nate?
00:57:39 OK, here we go.
00:57:40 We got some decent questions here.
00:57:41 So here's the first question by Atalexus.
00:57:46 There's a lot of A's and S's here.
00:57:47 But Atalexus says, should we feel bad
00:57:51 if we ask terrible questions?
00:57:53 Yes.
00:57:53 Yes, buddy boy.
00:57:55 And there's a second part in parentheses that says,
00:57:59 and if yes, what can we do to fix it?
00:58:01 So here's the person asking constructive questions.
00:58:04 I would say ask more specific ones
00:58:06 that let us answer with more,
00:58:08 like put a little thought into what you're going to hear
00:58:10 when you ask your question.
00:58:11 If you ask like, what do you guys think about
00:58:13 fucking Undertale?
00:58:18 But that's a whole.
00:58:21 Well, let me tell you what I think.
00:58:23 Let's shut up Undertale.
00:58:24 We made a whole podcast about Undertale.
00:58:27 It was the first one.
00:58:27 Yes, there's definitely enough Undertale-centric
00:58:31 media from us to ask for fucking lifetime.
00:58:34 There's not enough.
00:58:35 That would never be enough.
00:58:36 Are you aware, Jesse, that it's become a thing
00:58:38 where we're now just referring to video games
00:58:41 are Undertales?
00:58:43 Dude, I played the best Undertale today.
00:58:45 It was so fucking good.
00:58:46 It was like this fucking first, first shooter.
00:58:48 Well, that's the meme that everyone can be on board with.
00:58:50 That's right.
00:58:51 That's right.
00:58:52 It's like how in the South they call all pop and soda,
00:58:55 they call it all Coke.
00:58:56 They call it exactly like that.
00:58:58 Go out there and play some Undertales today, guys.
00:59:00 Undertale Five Ground Zeroes.
00:59:05 Okay, and here's another question by at Joseph Ingman.
00:59:10 At T.B. Crasonators, what's the coolest fight
00:59:13 you've ever been in?
00:59:14 So I know we're all men of the streets.
00:59:16 We're getting a lot of brawls,
00:59:17 but this guy's asking for the coolest fight.
00:59:20 When I wrestled a penguin on top of an ice cream.
00:59:23 Oh boy, he took it that direction.
00:59:28 Of course I would.
00:59:29 Have you ever thrown down with anybody, monkey?
00:59:32 Yeah, the best fight I've ever had
00:59:33 was in the the procrastinator's discord
00:59:36 where I was fighting with Jess
00:59:37 about whether or not he has an ego.
00:59:40 That was pretty good.
00:59:40 Oh boy, that was a legendary brawl.
00:59:42 Yeah, I said that he didn't, and he asserted that he did.
00:59:44 That was just you being a dumb guy.
00:59:48 Is that what you call it?
00:59:49 When you punch him out in the street,
00:59:52 that's not a fight.
00:59:53 That's him being a dead guy.
00:59:54 Exactly.
00:59:55 Because he's dead, because you killed him.
00:59:57 I've never just been in a fight.
00:59:58 I've only been in, there's a dead guy next to me now.
01:00:03 That's great.
01:00:04 He just did dead at me.
01:00:08 I often beat up my friends as a sign of love,
01:00:12 and that's not a joke.
01:00:14 It's a mutual wrestling, like we do often.
01:00:19 You might have heard, it's called gay sex.
01:00:22 Is that what you do to establish dominance over the group?
01:00:24 Yes, that's what Ben and Diddy do.
01:00:26 Yeah.
01:00:27 Wait, wait, wait, Ben, you've had sex with Diddy?
01:00:31 Oh, you know, you should ask Ben when he comes on.
01:00:32 You know, he's not here this episode,
01:00:34 but maybe next time we'll be here to answer that.
01:00:36 Everybody, watch this animation about Ben and Diddy being gay.
01:00:38 The point is that I definitely don't have an ego.
01:00:41 Anyone who thinks that either is misunderstanding me,
01:00:44 or misunderstanding what is meant by ego,
01:00:46 and is a complete retard who should not exist
01:00:49 and should kill themselves, the end.
01:00:51 What's the name of that animation you made
01:00:52 of Diddy and Ben being gay?
01:00:55 I'm gay.
01:00:55 It's called I'm gay.
01:01:02 It's on the Give and Take channel.
01:01:04 Yeah.
01:01:05 Wait, what was this?
01:01:05 What video is it?
01:01:06 Oh, okay, I remember now.
01:01:07 The plot of gun.
01:01:08 Yeah, the best animation I've ever made.
01:01:10 It's the video I've ever made about you, retard.
01:01:13 I remember, I remember.
01:01:14 Okay, here's another question.
01:01:17 Okay, at Kinkuck, I think it's Kinkuck.
01:01:22 I don't know, it's all K's.
01:01:23 Is that Kinkrat's cousin, Kinkuck?
01:01:26 Basically, yeah.
01:01:28 Okay, I'm speaking of Kinkrat.
01:01:29 Go check out his PCP Wiki page.
01:01:31 It's really good.
01:01:32 That's true.
01:01:33 That's true.
01:01:34 Made by, I don't know, Mysterious Forces.
01:01:36 Mysterious Forces came together to make that Wiki page,
01:01:39 and it's glorious, and all the information on there is true,
01:01:42 and has sources to prove what it says.
01:01:44 Yep, the mysterious Rhino editing
01:01:46 everyone's Wiki page in secret.
01:01:50 I learned something new about just every day.
01:01:54 God, who is he?
01:01:55 Who is that fucking Rhino?
01:01:57 No one will ever, that's the new mystery.
01:01:59 Now that we've solved the mystery of the PCP guy,
01:02:01 the next mystery is who the fuck is that Rhino?
01:02:03 We read farther in that manga,
01:02:06 there's actually a Rhino in there,
01:02:07 wearing a mask and a fedora.
01:02:10 Can we do a memes that need to die part two?
01:02:12 Oh my god, dude, what if there was a video where,
01:02:15 I mean, Colt Corona, I know he's real,
01:02:17 but what if he was wearing a horse mask,
01:02:19 and he took off the mask and underneath it
01:02:20 was the mysterious Rhinoster?
01:02:22 Oh my god, no!
01:02:23 It's my nightmare.
01:02:24 If that would be a nightmare.
01:02:26 And actually, the next question I was about to read,
01:02:28 Kink Cuck asked,
01:02:30 what will happen now that the origin of the PCP guy
01:02:32 has been rediscovered, or has been discovered,
01:02:35 now mysterious Rhino is their new mascot.
01:02:36 He's a new mystery guy, there you go.
01:02:38 The mysterious Rhino is our new mascot.
01:02:40 We put him in the corner of our thumbnails
01:02:42 and instantly all of our subscribers leave.
01:02:46 We have patrons in the negatives, we owe people money.
01:02:52 Oh, I wish you could pledge negative amounts to patrons.
01:02:54 Hey, but why do I want to know right now,
01:02:56 you fucking hacks?
01:02:57 Has he been on the side of the screen the whole time?
01:03:00 Yeah.
01:03:00 Oh my god, I don't know.
01:03:01 Oh, get out of here!
01:03:02 Get out of here, mysterious man!
01:03:04 I don't know what you're giving me out,
01:03:05 dude, get the fuck out of here.
01:03:07 Wait, wait, okay, so why do I want to know
01:03:08 from you fucking hacks?
01:03:10 Jess, tell Colt Corona my question.
01:03:12 When are you just going to invite the fucking Rhino on?
01:03:16 To the animal cast?
01:03:17 For an animal cast?
01:03:18 That's a good question.
01:03:19 Well, maybe on animal cast.
01:03:21 I just don't want him on like a people cast
01:03:22 among civilized folk.
01:03:24 He's uncontrollable.
01:03:25 He doesn't belong in society.
01:03:26 He tried to integrate into society once.
01:03:28 He had a whole thriving business.
01:03:30 He was a gynecologist.
01:03:31 They called him Rhino the gyno.
01:03:33 It was a whole big thing.
01:03:34 He got fucking disbarred.
01:03:35 He lost his license to practice medicine
01:03:38 because he kept molesting and raping with his horn.
01:03:41 And it was just a whole, whole big thing.
01:03:43 So that didn't pan out.
01:03:44 He was homeless for a long time.
01:03:45 You know, I found him on the streets.
01:03:47 I offered him a job.
01:03:48 I helped him out a little bit.
01:03:50 And he's been, he owes me a life debt now.
01:03:52 He won't leave me alone.
01:03:54 I just want him to go away.
01:03:55 But he thinks he owes me something,
01:03:57 even though I'm a white man
01:03:59 and he considers all of us evil satans
01:04:01 who deserve to die for some reason.
01:04:03 He's still, and he's fucking, you know,
01:04:05 and the last time I heard from him,
01:04:07 he, you know, he got a gun
01:04:08 and he went into like a town square
01:04:10 and he started shooting people.
01:04:12 And they never caught him.
01:04:14 So I don't know.
01:04:16 I don't know, man.
01:04:17 Maybe he's back home in Africa.
01:04:19 Ray belongs.
01:04:22 I long for the day he returns.
01:04:25 He never does.
01:04:27 Here's another question.
01:04:28 This is, this is more of a challenge than anything,
01:04:30 but I, I find it interesting.
01:04:32 So at Cephirzer asks,
01:04:35 Hey Tbc, can each one of you
01:04:38 say something good about your fans
01:04:41 other than giving you money?
01:04:43 That's a tough one, dude.
01:04:44 That is a tough one.
01:04:45 I can.
01:04:46 I like all my friends.
01:04:47 I mean fans, which I don't have.
01:04:50 But I was confused in sentence.
01:04:52 Fuck you.
01:04:53 I don't like them.
01:04:53 They're mine.
01:04:54 I don't like them anymore.
01:04:54 So you like them.
01:04:55 Okay.
01:04:55 You like them.
01:04:56 All right.
01:04:57 Well, I guess generally I feel like
01:04:59 the comments I get on my videos
01:05:01 are less terrible than comments
01:05:03 that any of you other people get.
01:05:06 So I guess they're good commenters in general.
01:05:10 If I could be sincere as I always am
01:05:12 and never anything else,
01:05:14 the best parts of probably my life,
01:05:16 the last few months have been when
01:05:19 somebody has read my book
01:05:20 and they'll send me like a really in-depth,
01:05:22 several paragraph long analysis of it
01:05:25 or just telling me how they liked it.
01:05:27 So that sort of thing like really gets to me
01:05:30 and I really enjoy that if that answers the question.
01:05:33 That I think does.
01:05:35 That's a nice thing.
01:05:36 Jesse, say something nice.
01:05:43 You know, I got one actually.
01:05:45 Maybe you'll, I guess what Mumki said is also true.
01:05:50 Occasionally, once in a blue moon,
01:05:52 I'll get like a really long thoughtful comment
01:05:55 on like a video of mine that says like,
01:05:58 oh, this touched me in a special way
01:06:00 and here's why you resonate with me
01:06:02 and I like you a lot and blah, blah, blah.
01:06:05 And those feel okay, I guess.
01:06:07 I don't know if they're worth it.
01:06:09 You know what it is?
01:06:09 If they're worth the rest of the fucking shit show.
01:06:11 But you know what the best thing is about any commenter
01:06:14 is when they're actually sincere in that comment.
01:06:16 That's, yeah, so it's sincerity.
01:06:18 Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
01:06:21 The fucking code, there we go.
01:06:22 Like how much do you enjoy when they're like,
01:06:24 lol, you such a fag, headless Jess, lol,
01:06:27 I speak your language, dude, get it?
01:06:29 You're a culture fag.
01:06:30 I don't enjoy that, Nate.
01:06:32 I don't, I don't think I enjoy that very much.
01:06:34 The irony is very destructive
01:06:35 and anything that's not sincere,
01:06:38 I just banned from the comment section
01:06:39 because I'm a big man.
01:06:41 Yes, exactly.
01:06:42 Monkey's trying to be ironic,
01:06:44 he's trying to have a goof on me,
01:06:45 but I'm completely sincere in that sentiment.
01:06:47 I am a big man and I will ban you
01:06:49 for being anything less than sincere.
01:06:51 Fuck you all, I take back anything nice I say
01:06:54 about any of my fans ever, you're bad and die.
01:06:57 Can Jess's new title be officially big man?
01:07:02 Hashtag big man.
01:07:04 And I just like to say that I think the only nice thing
01:07:07 I can say about any of my viewers
01:07:10 is if you're watching my content,
01:07:11 you obviously have great taste,
01:07:13 so there you go, there's your compliment.
01:07:15 Press 1 if you're a fan of Munchy.
01:07:18 One, fan of Munchy.
01:07:20 Press 2 if Jessie should shit himself.
01:07:27 Fuck!
01:07:28 Ah locals, fuck you, do this to me!
01:07:32 Fuck you, do this to me!
01:07:38 I'd like to point out that Munchy
01:07:39 has literally pissed on stream
01:07:41 And is number one and Jesse every time shits himself and is number two now. So there you go
01:07:46 We got number one number two. We uh, there's no other than the basic b-box
01:07:50 Is that is that vomit or is that I mean what is what is number three?
01:07:54 I think it should come because I want to make hippo come. I don't discriminate against women who can't come women should be
01:07:59 able to produce number three, right?
01:08:03 Any more questions nader, can I just
01:08:06 For you, buddies everybody press three for us all the twiddle or clits
01:08:21 Is that mage wait, did you just say that's mage? No, that's what you said. That's your clitoris talking to you right in the night
01:08:35 If an Asian girl is masturbating is that beans and rice? Yes. Yes, it is in our sideways vagina
01:08:42 So she has to reach over to the side
01:08:47 I am your clitoris I control your brain stemmed out to go have what protected sex with strangers
01:08:53 I didn't make taxpayers pay for your abortion
01:08:57 Wait, is that Bernie Sanders as everyone's clit?
01:09:00 Bernie Sanders is on Eric's clit
01:09:03 As Bernie Sanders as a clit at deceived eel asks, what do you think of these fans that worship everything that you do?
01:09:12 I hate them. I don't I don't get that myself. I don't really I know well
01:09:15 I guess it's better than it's better than not worshiping everything. I do I suppose but neither is preferable
01:09:23 Yeah, I think if you I mean people say they worship everything you do
01:09:27 But they're probably normal in that they enjoy
01:09:31 Stuff and sometimes they don't enjoy it, but they just want you to know that they are a fan
01:09:36 Yeah, you know what I take it back. It's good and everyone should do that. I forget what I said before
01:09:40 It's good. Everyone should like everything I do
01:09:44 I agree unless I don't like it because then it's objectively bad because I'm the author and I have the final say on it
01:09:51 Well, let me tell you I get a little peeved at these guys who say they love everything and then don't give me money on
