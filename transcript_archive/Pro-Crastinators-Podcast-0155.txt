00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever and today we've got Hippocrit.
00:00:10 I've got the Oscar fever. Hope you got it too.
00:00:15 Got Tom Oliver.
00:00:18 My brain is full of blood and all I do is suck blood.
00:00:25 Get that blood out of there, Ben Saint.
00:00:28 Get that brain out of here. That's so fucking nasty, man. That's so fucking nasty.
00:00:34 Munchy is present.
00:00:36 Hi guys. Hope you're ready for some comedy gold on this podcast where I'll be exclusively quoting The Loco Bandito by Mike Matei.
00:00:44 That's a rich bounty there.
00:00:46 Holy shit, says The Loco Bandito.
00:00:49 And of course, Endless Jess is here.
00:00:52 Bitch, me, I'm laying on my bed like a teen girl in a sleepover. I'm gonna lay down on my tummy with my feet in the air.
00:01:00 Nice.
00:01:02 Is that what sleepovers like? I never went to one.
00:01:07 I always wanted to go to a little girl's sleepover at a little, little bed, little teeny-bopper bitch.
00:01:15 You've been to a homoerotic male sleepover though, surely, correct?
00:01:19 I mean, of course. I mean, I invented the homoerotic male sleepover.
00:01:24 I mean, I grew up straight.
00:01:26 I had a pretty homoerotic male sleepover, but with one guy and he just slept in my bed.
00:01:32 But with his feet near my head and my head near his feet.
00:01:37 Oh, so you didn't know the position, right?
00:01:39 We were like ten. We didn't even understand what was weird about it.
00:01:42 We had lab dicks back then.
00:01:44 I got a funny story. I got a funny story that happened just yesterday, so I'm hanging out with a couple of friends.
00:01:49 I'm not gonna say what their names were to protect the innocent.
00:01:52 It's friend A and friend B.
00:01:55 You've never been this cautious before in your entire life.
00:01:59 And for the story, you said they're like their full name.
00:02:03 Well, I don't know. There's a mild chance that one of these three people might actually hear the show, so that would be embarrassing.
00:02:10 But it was really funny because there's friend A, friend B, and they have a mutual friend, friend C, who's not there.
00:02:16 Friend B is like, hey, A.
00:02:18 So yeah, you know, friend C, yeah.
00:02:21 It was really obvious when I met him that he was like into me in like a gay way.
00:02:25 And friend A is like a ghast.
00:02:28 He's like, no, dude, no.
00:02:30 Friend C is absolutely not gay.
00:02:32 He's like my best friend.
00:02:34 He's totally not gay. That's totally impossible.
00:02:36 I mean, look, I know he's fucked around with it.
00:02:39 Shut up.
00:02:40 Like, I know he's like, I know he's fucked some guys before, right?
00:02:43 But it's always been in like a straight way, right?
00:02:45 Like, it's always, this is not a joke.
00:02:47 He literally said like, I know he's fucked guys, but not, but in like a whole heterosexual way.
00:02:52 This gets down to the fundamental.
00:02:53 I believe that there is a heterosexual way to fuck a man.
00:02:57 There's not.
00:02:58 You and fucking friend A.
00:03:00 Get the fuck out of here.
00:03:02 Listen, I doubt that's what happened in this situation.
00:03:04 Here's a real situation.
00:03:06 You're at a glory hole.
00:03:08 You get your dick sucked.
00:03:09 Turns out it was a guy.
00:03:11 That was a sexual encounter.
00:03:12 Okay, well that's not gay.
00:03:13 Your intention doesn't matter.
00:03:15 No, no, intention is everything.
00:03:17 Of course intention matters.
00:03:18 Of course intention matters.
00:03:19 Yeah, intention matters.
00:03:21 But no, no, that was a gay act, but you were not being gay.
00:03:26 Munchy, you're insane.
00:03:27 Of course intent matters.
00:03:28 There is a distinction between, like, I had this argue with Michelle just the other day.
00:03:32 It's that the act itself, you could call gay sex between two men,
00:03:36 but the, like, to call the individual gay depends on their intention, I would say.
00:03:41 If someone has fucked dudes multiple times though,
00:03:44 you only get so many get out of jail free cards in my thoughts.
00:03:47 Well, at a certain point you can doubt,
00:03:48 if they claim that every time was an accident,
00:03:51 then like, if that's true, then I suppose that's fair.
00:03:54 But one can doubt the credulity of these claims.
00:03:57 Alright, I have a strong opinion about all this talk of is it gay or not.
00:04:05 All sex is just like rubbing meat parts together.
00:04:09 It's all fucking gay.
00:04:10 It's all the same shit.
00:04:11 It's all fucking gay.
00:04:12 Fucking a woman is the same thing as fucking a guy.
00:04:15 I'm saying it.
00:04:17 Well, it depends how much you care about gender and sex, I suppose.
00:04:23 Well, you're just slamming into each other.
00:04:26 You're just slamming into each other in some various, like, you know, twisted pretzels sort of way.
00:04:32 And like, ultimately, you're just feeling like the hot, sweaty meat action with, like, that's what sex is.
00:04:38 I mean, you're just throwing out the whole question of is it gay or not.
00:04:40 You're saying that it doesn't matter.
00:04:42 You're basically just dispensing with the whole proposition of gayness to begin with.
00:04:47 Yeah.
00:04:48 Okay, okay.
00:04:49 I gotta cover my angles.
00:04:51 Hippo has answered the GQ.
00:04:54 Yeah, that's long last.
00:04:56 We've been searching for it.
00:04:57 And I realized that it's pretty much the same question.
00:04:59 Remember when we were arguing about, like, the sort of, like, the trans-bathroom debate?
00:05:03 And then Digi's like, why even have separate bathrooms at all?
00:05:06 And I was like, that actually makes sense.
00:05:08 That seems like the way to go.
00:05:10 I don't want poop where a girl can hear me.
00:05:13 Well, that's, you know, not to make it an issue, but I actually did hear recently that, like,
00:05:18 the thing about that is that sexual assaults have actually gone up in, like, non-
00:05:23 or, you know, like, group gender areas where they just say everybody goes to the same bathroom.
00:05:28 But you know what?
00:05:29 I don't know.
00:05:30 Maybe it's an imperfect answer.
00:05:31 I mean, that's probably true to some extent.
00:05:34 I just feel like the whole, like, I don't want to poop near a girl.
00:05:38 I mean, just because I poop away from a girl doesn't mean that that girl will like me.
00:05:44 Well, no.
00:05:47 That's not what it's about.
00:05:49 I just don't want to do it.
00:05:50 I just don't want to do it.
00:05:52 I mean, there's nothing more to it.
00:05:55 Perhaps if one dug deep down into the motivation behind that feeling,
00:05:58 you'd find that it's, you know, kind of centered in these, I don't know,
00:06:02 attraction dynamics of gender associations.
00:06:05 Yeah, or we could just accept that I just don't want to do it.
00:06:09 But I'm going to take it a step further and I don't want to poop anywhere that anyone can hear me.
00:06:14 I don't want to be near anyone's vicinity at all.
00:06:17 That too.
00:06:18 But it would be way worse if it was a girl.
00:06:20 Let's just, let's just, let's just rip that band-aid off right now.
00:06:23 Good ol' Ben, the binary.
00:06:25 Good ol' Ben, cisgender, cisgender's only please.
00:06:30 That was in quotes.
00:06:31 That's my middle nickname, Saint.
00:06:35 Hey, speaking of Ben and genitals, I heard about a phenomenon recently
00:06:40 that I'm wondering if you have any experience with Ben.
00:06:43 It is the phenomenon known only as Keto, it's known as Keto crotch.
00:06:49 This is the name of the phenomenon.
00:06:51 Well, well, Nate, describe it to me and I will tell you if it speaks to my life experience.
00:06:57 Certainly.
00:06:58 So it, it's a phenomenon where the keto diet supposedly has a,
00:07:04 a onerous effect on the smell of women's crotches.
00:07:09 Well then why the fuck would I have any experience with?
00:07:11 I'm wondering if perhaps there's some overlap with the male experience.
00:07:14 I mean, we all know that Ben's odiferous lifestyle is a thing of legend.
00:07:17 Odiferous lifestyle.
00:07:19 You know, it's, now of course that was established long ago,
00:07:22 but perhaps there's been some change.
00:07:24 Perhaps it's had some kind of total change.
00:07:26 Are you saying like Ben probably smells like a woman now?
00:07:28 What do you say?
00:07:29 Totally over, totally overblown.
00:07:31 Everyone agrees.
00:07:33 A few, everyone took like the one time that I was at Digi's house for three days
00:07:37 and didn't get so naive.
00:07:39 And wasn't, and wasn't there and didn't have my own deodorant and yeah,
00:07:43 didn't shower cause I was over someone else's house.
00:07:45 Yeah.
00:07:46 And so I smelled kind of bad and everyone's like, uh-huh, Ben smells so bad.
00:07:49 Well, you know, fuck you.
00:07:50 Okay.
00:07:51 That, that was like a one, that was like a, that was like a specific incident.
00:07:55 Okay.
00:07:56 It's just that Ben, in my opinion,
00:07:58 I would say every time we have met over the last several years,
00:08:02 were those all outliers?
00:08:04 Cause I would say that pretty much all of those times.
00:08:06 If you're telling me that I smelled weird every single time we've met over the last several years,
00:08:11 then I'm just going to call you a liar right to your face.
00:08:13 That could be an exaggeration, but that, that's my general impression.
00:08:17 Perhaps that's, you know, not specifically correct every single instance.
00:08:21 It's not.
00:08:22 It's not correct.
00:08:23 There you go.
00:08:24 But, but I mean, don't you think the fact that I have an impression says something about the situation?
00:08:27 No, Nate, I think you're dumb.
00:08:29 And I think, and honest, I, Nate, I literally, I know this is going to be really insulting to you.
00:08:34 And I think honestly that the fact that it happened like the last time has like colored your, your perception.
00:08:40 But I was saying it before that dammit.
00:08:42 I was saying it long before that.
00:08:44 I think it's also, um, that it's funny to say it, and that's what you want to believe.
00:08:49 Well, there's that.
00:08:50 Yeah.
00:08:51 It's true.
00:08:52 This could be a biased position, but.
00:08:53 Nate, you're like the, you're one of like two people that say it.
00:08:56 And the other one is your girlfriend.
00:08:58 And I think, and I think the two of you just think it's funny.
00:09:00 Honestly, I think that's it.
00:09:02 Yeah.
00:09:03 We plot.
00:09:04 Yeah.
00:09:05 Um, she is sensitive to smell though.
00:09:06 So I mean, you know, sure.
00:09:08 She's got quite the nose.
00:09:09 Well, Jesse, were you, were you commenting on this?
00:09:10 Oh, I just feel celebratory like any time that anyone is told that they smell and it's not me.
00:09:18 That's understandable.
00:09:19 Smelling bad is like my worst fear in life.
00:09:21 It's the worst thing that can happen to a person.
00:09:23 I'm so mad at the foot that this episode got off to.
00:09:26 Honestly.
00:09:27 Well, that's unfortunate.
00:09:28 It's the worst thing in the world.
00:09:29 Listen, my, my, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
00:09:34 That's all I have to say.
00:09:36 When you're sorry, Jesse, when you're in your house and you're not planning on guests and
00:09:41 you're in your own funk and you're in your own smells and you're enjoying it, you're
00:09:44 just living your smelly life as a smelly person alone and everything's fine.
00:09:49 You know, and then someone just barges in and says, Hey, it's me.
00:09:53 You're fucking friends and let's take you someplace out in public right now.
00:09:57 It's like, no, I smell bad.
00:10:00 Go away.
00:10:01 But they don't listen.
00:10:02 You know, they take you out.
00:10:03 They just, they just barge in.
00:10:04 They throw you in a car and kidnap you and you've been sitting there.
00:10:06 You haven't showered in like three weeks as you didn't want to see anybody.
00:10:09 You didn't, you just wanted to be home and be smelly and be in peace.
00:10:12 Just, but no one.
00:10:13 So they take, you know, and then, and then it's all like, Oh man, this guy fucking smells
00:10:17 like, yeah, I was happily smelling bad alone.
00:10:20 And then you took me out to a place where people will notice it.
00:10:23 You scum for, you know, for, forget gender.
00:10:26 I would say that scent is in fact a social construct that we are being held to a
00:10:30 standard that there is no, it's all society that imposes this need to smell
00:10:34 decently or even look decent.
00:10:36 When I'm alone and there's no one around to judge me.
00:10:39 I love smelling bad.
00:10:41 It's really cool.
00:10:42 Yes.
00:10:43 The same.
00:10:44 There's a certain pleasure.
00:10:46 All right.
00:10:47 Maybe I'm crazy.
00:10:48 There's a certain pleasure in hot boxing and your own farts in a small room.
00:10:52 Am I right?
00:10:55 Ladies and gentlemen, I feel so much better about myself.
00:10:58 I'll beg you.
00:10:59 I'll beg you.
00:11:00 I'll beg you.
00:11:01 I'll beg you.
00:11:02 The Nate facade is beginning to crack and it rode away and realizing that he's just
00:11:07 as degenerate as the rest of us.
00:11:09 I'm able to put on a social veneer when I leave.
00:11:12 So that's the difference.
00:11:13 This is what happens when you don't have a job.
00:11:15 You go from Nate to us.
00:11:17 The mask gets crumbled.
00:11:19 Fair.
00:11:20 I can't shower for even like three days.
00:11:21 I get dandruff and that just ruins my life.
00:11:23 I just get dandruff and I get greasy.
00:11:25 And so if I do that, then my life will just be ruined.
00:11:27 It's not even like a like, I can just like not do any, like do no hygiene thing into my
00:11:31 life will be fine.
00:11:32 It just actually makes me feel like I am a gross potato.
00:11:35 Yeah.
00:11:36 I'm the same way.
00:11:37 I got like a, I got a three day window tops for him just like, nah, this is just untenable
00:11:42 even for me at this point.
00:11:43 Yeah.
00:11:44 If there was like a comfortable way to wash your hair without getting the rest of you wet,
00:11:48 I would like never shower again.
00:11:49 Cause that's all I really care about is make sure my hair stays.
00:11:52 It's true.
00:11:53 There's no way to do it.
00:11:54 You can't like, you can't like pull up a chair and like lean over the sink like you're
00:11:56 in a salon.
00:11:57 Like that's gay.
00:11:58 It's not straight.
00:11:59 I hate to bring up a, I hate to bring up a topic from last week, but, but this, you're
00:12:03 almost making a case for baldness right now.
00:12:05 Oh crap.
00:12:06 I am.
00:12:07 I take it all back.
00:12:08 Let's all just shave our heads for next episode.
00:12:13 Let's all just embrace it.
00:12:15 Yeah.
00:12:16 We'll be clean shaven.
00:12:17 You know, when you get your hair cut and you ask them to wash your hair and they like
00:12:21 they'd lean you back and that like sink thing and they wash their hair for you.
00:12:25 I want, I want, I want a butler just so you knew that every day of my life.
00:12:29 Yeah.
00:12:30 I really liked that.
00:12:31 I haven't done it too many times, but it's good.
00:12:34 The one time I did have it was like, um, you remember when I had like hair or like really
00:12:41 big fat, like too long, like Jesus times two sort of hair and a really big beard.
00:12:46 It was like uni days where I was like, I don't know what a haircut is.
00:12:49 I don't know how to go to a haircut.
00:12:52 Um, yeah.
00:12:53 University days.
00:12:54 You know, what are they?
00:12:55 No, no, no.
00:12:56 I know.
00:12:57 I say uni over in the brick bar.
00:12:58 I'm just saying, uh, not days is in days, but as in days, like, where am I?
00:13:02 Oh, yeah.
00:13:03 Just stay between college and university period.
00:13:06 I think college implies that it's cool.
00:13:08 Well, in America, I think you can, they grant doctorates, universities grant doctorates,
00:13:12 I think.
00:13:13 Uh, is that a different distinction?
00:13:15 There's a slight difference.
00:13:16 There's some overlap in what you can get on as masters, whatever.
00:13:19 That's not the point.
00:13:20 You know, it's like a better though, right?
00:13:21 In general, the point is I had big hair and I went to like my mom said, you just gotta
00:13:27 go to a fucking salon or something.
00:13:29 And I'm like, oh, okay.
00:13:31 I went to a thing.
00:13:33 There was this old guy who was into Led Zeppelin.
00:13:36 So I could actually talk to him about something for once and he was like, oh my God, you got
00:13:41 too much hair.
00:13:43 We're going to have to take it off like in parts.
00:13:45 We're going to have to amputate.
00:13:47 We're going to have to take this off in parts so that you don't like overcompensate like
00:13:55 your neck movements.
00:13:56 It's going to be like a tattoo.
00:13:57 It's going to do it like a tattoo, like you got to come in for multiple visits.
00:14:01 Yeah.
00:14:02 It's just like he did it slowly.
00:14:03 And I assume he's felt this before when if you take like so much weight off of your head,
00:14:10 you'll feel dazed and smash your head into the wall or something stupid.
00:14:14 But he was really, he was really good at doing the salon stuff.
00:14:19 And there was so much hair.
00:14:20 It almost couldn't fit in the sink.
00:14:22 But it was really nice.
00:14:24 Dude, isn't it the fucking coolest shit when you go, especially, oh dude, I don't know.
00:14:29 I don't know if any of you know this.
00:14:30 I don't know if I was seen with any of you like in real life during this time.
00:14:33 There was a brief period of time where I had hair down to like below my shoulders, like
00:14:39 below like, like the bottom of my shoulders.
00:14:42 It was really, really long.
00:14:45 And you think a munchie.
00:14:46 You think like, oh, you know, it's got like Steven Universe kind of poofy hair.
00:14:49 When you have ethnic wavy hair and it's long, there's no poof.
00:14:54 It just is straight fucking like nightmare fuel.
00:14:58 It's straight like the worst.
00:15:00 Okay.
00:15:01 If I could give any advice to children, it's cut your hair.
00:15:05 If there's like a psychological, like you, you create a real ATV field when you have long hair.
00:15:11 And you just think, you can hide behind your hair and it won't even matter.
00:15:15 You know, I'm a kid, but I'm so cool.
00:15:17 I think he means an ATV field.
00:15:19 Yeah.
00:15:20 An ATV field.
00:15:21 It's an altering vehicle field.
00:15:23 Yeah.
00:15:24 You can go anywhere.
00:15:25 You can go anywhere.
00:15:26 You can go anywhere.
00:15:28 Dude, you can go anywhere.
00:15:29 Finally.
00:15:30 You have no hubris.
00:15:31 You have no humility, I mean.
00:15:33 So it's, it's, it's not a good thing.
00:15:36 So anyway, I had that and I went in for a haircut one fateful day.
00:15:39 And the amount of hair that was on a, just on the ground, the corpse of my, my hair.
00:15:47 And I was down to a small haircut.
00:15:49 It was a, it was, I can make like an entire wig out of it.
00:15:52 I can make maybe two wigs out of it.
00:15:54 It was copious maths.
00:15:56 Hey, cool.
00:15:57 I just want to say, incidentally, I'm posting a link in the, in the audio links chat.
00:16:02 I just want to point out, I was just brought this meal by Michelle that is a poke bowl,
00:16:07 which is like cut up fish with like this weird concoction of sauce on brown rice
00:16:12 and a filleted fish.
00:16:14 And it's just stupendous.
00:16:16 And it's before me right now.
00:16:18 I'm going to be eating it.
00:16:19 You think I don't know.
00:16:20 You're like shit.
00:16:21 I don't know about poke.
00:16:22 I know about poke.
00:16:23 I don't know.
00:16:24 It's some island shit, Michelle.
00:16:25 I thought you, I thought you were talking about like a Pokemon themed food.
00:16:29 Like a poke bowl.
00:16:31 It's made of magic harps and rice chan.
00:16:34 That's my favorite Pokemon.
00:16:36 That's the result of all the magic harp jump.
00:16:38 You have to train the perfect magic harp and it's ripe.
00:16:41 Every, every, every time you, every time you're, you're loses.
00:16:44 Every time you take a magic harp to the championship league and it loses,
00:16:47 you cut it up into a poke bowl and then you feed it to your next one for a little experience.
00:16:52 You induce, you induce the stress by torturing it.
00:16:54 And if it survives, that's how do you get a Gyarados?
00:16:57 All the ones that die become your food.
00:17:00 Hey, incidentally, like a few minutes ago, somebody mentioned butlers.
00:17:04 I was just thinking about this today.
00:17:06 Here's a real question.
00:17:07 Life sucks because what the hell happened to like having servants?
00:17:11 You could be like middle class and have a servant back in the good old 1800s or whatever it was.
00:17:18 What happened to that?
00:17:19 Why don't we have slavery mate?
00:17:21 No, it's literally not slavery.
00:17:23 I'm talking about like New England servants in like...
00:17:25 It's that, it's that god damn, it's the god damn politicians and their god damn raise in the minimum wage agenda.
00:17:32 I think it might be something like this.
00:17:34 Yeah, basically.
00:17:35 I'd be happy to pay a minimum wage for a servant, but I don't think that like exists.
00:17:41 Well, Nate, you can have like a person to come clean your house for like, you don't need to be fabulously wealthy to have someone do that.
00:17:49 I want a live-in Alfred style butler who's fiercely loyal and will keep my secrets and sit brave with me while we conspire.
00:17:54 That's expensive.
00:17:55 Nate, I think you've stumbled upon a new market.
00:17:57 Hear me out here.
00:17:58 Uber for servants.
00:18:02 Ew, I don't want a gross millennial butler.
00:18:04 They will fuck everything up.
00:18:05 I want an old English gentleman who, you know, fought in World War II and was a fighter pilot.
00:18:10 You don't want one of these kids doing the shig economy.
00:18:13 Butlers are, butlers are men.
00:18:15 You want a maid with a nice booty.
00:18:17 Yeah, completely grits, Jesse.
00:18:18 And sexual fighters are definitely men.
00:18:20 Well, okay, never mind.
00:18:22 That's definitely true.
00:18:23 That's definitely true.
00:18:24 Cassie's dad has a maid for his apartment.
00:18:30 Okay, there.
00:18:31 And it is like, from what I can understand, it's like the greatest investment that you can have just to not have your house dirty.
00:18:39 And because he cooks a lot, his kitchen's completely fucked 100% of the time.
00:18:44 Because he's making really complex shit and just every pot and pan is all over the floor.
00:18:49 So she takes care of it then?
00:18:50 Yeah, she takes care of it.
00:18:51 Just like all the bodies and all the people you guys are to kill.
00:18:54 I don't even need this now.
00:18:55 I want this like in 10 years.
00:18:57 So I want to prepare the market so I'm ready by the time I actually need a maid.
00:19:01 It's moments like this when you realize just like you're not living real life, you know, like, like peasant life is just so far beneath what could be.
00:19:10 I don't know, man.
00:19:12 They're pretty luxurious.
00:19:15 It's literally just like, I don't want to clean myself.
00:19:19 Please do it for me.
00:19:20 Right.
00:19:21 There are people who just like they don't drive.
00:19:23 They don't clean.
00:19:24 Like all these like grindy aspects of life are just so unknown to them.
00:19:28 It seems to me like like the bar has shifted.
00:19:32 Like obviously somebody like, I'm sure Jeff Bezos has people who like, you know, clean his house or whatever.
00:19:37 So obviously that's the number one guy in the world.
00:19:39 But like, didn't there used to be like a middle class equivalent?
00:19:42 And sure, we've got this literal gig economy made thing.
00:19:45 But like the classical person is really just a case of like the population of the middle class has just increased.
00:19:54 Like middle class used to be more, more rare than it.
00:19:58 Yeah, I think it's just at some point.
00:20:01 Yeah, at some point, like what was considered middle class, like what was considered normal was like, you know, we probably think maybe we like shrink that wealth gap a little bit.
00:20:11 But good, but good news.
00:20:13 Good news.
00:20:14 The wealth gap is widening again.
00:20:16 So soon we'll have soon we'll have a big old underclass that can be the upper class.
00:20:20 You know, there's been because I was actually thinking about that.
00:20:22 And I was, I heard that, you know, the wealth gap is the widest it's ever been.
00:20:25 Does that mean that?
00:20:26 Okay.
00:20:27 I don't know about the widest it's ever been.
00:20:29 But it's okay.
00:20:30 But it's widening.
00:20:31 I mean, you know, considering exactly how rich Bezos may be, it could well be.
00:20:35 I mean, he, you know, it's such ridiculous wealth that guy has compared to other people.
00:20:39 Okay.
00:20:40 Anyway, by pointing to the issue is that the people at the bottom are being a condensed group.
00:20:44 So that group doesn't have enough play between the top and the bottom to get that kind of made servant culture thing going on.
00:20:50 Because the top people, of course, can afford this kind of a thing.
00:20:53 But it's not like wide.
00:20:55 Okay.
00:20:56 You know what?
00:20:57 Never mind.
00:20:58 Never mind.
00:20:59 No, I think like, imagine like the middle class that like, if we're in that bracket, like the jobs we could do, we wouldn't become butlers for the super
00:21:08 rich above us.
00:21:10 But we totally could.
00:21:12 And then we would get to be like hanging out in a really cool house a lot of the time.
00:21:16 All that we would need to do is clean up.
00:21:18 I was a tour guide in some of the Newport mansions, which are some of the craziest, like, they're like America royalty mansions, basically.
00:21:25 Some of the biggest spildons in America.
00:21:27 It's always been interesting to me the idea that, you know, the Butler is like a lower class person doing a job and stuff.
00:21:34 But they get to live and work in a really, really upper class amazing place.
00:21:41 Yeah.
00:21:42 And if they have a nice like employer, then it seems pretty cool and pretty great in every aspect.
00:21:49 It could be worse for sure.
00:21:50 I guess it's almost reminds me like the house Negro versus the field Negro and how the house one would often be fiercely loyal to Massa.
00:21:58 Because, you know, to protect his privileged position relative to the others, despite being a literal slave.
00:22:03 As made famous by Django Unchained and nothing else.
00:22:07 I'm not sure what to make of this conversation.
00:22:09 I can't tell.
00:22:10 Like, are you like, are you like, I can't tell if you guys are talking, are you talking about this is a good thing or a bad thing?
00:22:18 I mean, I wasn't thinking of slavery, but now I am.
00:22:20 I mean, no, no, we're not.
00:22:21 We're that's a whole other ball game.
00:22:23 I mean, obviously we're all for that.
00:22:25 But I mean, I suppose thinking backwards, if the reason for this situation, me decrying the fact that I can't easily acquire a butler is due to a fact that the middle class has condensed and possibly like lowered relative to total wealth of the population.
00:22:40 That I suppose that is a bad thing.
00:22:43 No, no, here's what I think.
00:22:45 It's not that you at your current wealth level can't acquire a butler anymore, whereas maybe in the past you could have.
00:22:53 In the past, in those times, you would have just been poor and someone else would have been richer and maybe they would have hired you as a butler.
00:23:01 Why? What do you mean?
00:23:02 Because I would have been like, I'm not a noble or something.
00:23:04 You're not you're not high enough on you're not high enough on the food chain to like if the wealth gap were to widen to the point where like servants were a thing we're seen as common for like quote unquote the middle class.
00:23:18 Or the average family.
00:23:20 You're not high enough on the totem pole that you'd be above the gap if it were to open again.
00:23:24 If we just take it back.
00:23:25 If that if that if that gap were to open that you would fall right into that chasm.
00:23:29 Okay, but our dad like is a doctor when I think about like doctors in the olden days.
00:23:33 And again, maybe they're like he wouldn't have made it because doctors are not would never like rich people.
00:23:39 The richest people in all this businessmen to get a servant of some kind in like I don't agree with that.
00:23:45 I don't think so.
00:23:46 I think there were all like entrepreneurs and businessmen and people who were born into families who had that stuff already.
00:23:53 This is a lot of talking out of our ass.
00:23:56 I mean, have you been on this podcast before?
00:24:00 Munchie research informed statements.
00:24:03 No, no, no, no.
00:24:04 I want to distribute my my energy on the most efficient things possible and like do in my dishes feels like a waste of time.
00:24:14 I would be happy to pay someone to do that so I could spend that time doing other stuff and that's.
00:24:19 You can buy a dishwasher.
00:24:20 I'm pretty sure.
00:24:22 Nate, I'm pretty sure.
00:24:23 I mean, like.
00:24:25 I mean, there were times like lazy, but I just want to do more work is the thing.
00:24:30 So, you know, there were there were times when our dad like would hire like a maid or something to come not on like a regular base.
00:24:37 But like to just come and like clean the house or whatever.
00:24:40 And and I mean, I mean, they my point is those things do exist.
00:24:45 Those jobs do exist and people do.
00:24:47 Of course they just seems like for the for the yes, but I want like a regular person who's there every day to do the cooking and cleaning that and I will be happy to pay.
00:24:56 Well, that just well, that just seems inefficient because they're not going to.
00:24:59 They're not going to have to do a full house clean every single day.
00:25:03 You don't even need to pay for that.
00:25:04 That's called a wife that knows her place.
00:25:06 Well, that's fair.
00:25:08 But like here's but I don't believe it's tough to control a wife.
00:25:12 It's much easier to control an employee.
00:25:14 So I'm happy to just use that mechanism.
00:25:16 You're just you're just not malicious enough to get the control.
00:25:19 That's possible.
00:25:20 That's possible.
00:25:21 Why control with your wallet when you control with fear?
00:25:24 Fair, fair.
00:25:26 Ben, I know I know this episode start.
00:25:29 Oh, you want to finish this conversation?
00:25:31 I just going to say, yeah, you want someone to do your dishes.
00:25:34 You can hire someone to do your dishes.
00:25:36 Wait, have a son.
00:25:37 Have a son.
00:25:38 I guess that's the way to do it.
00:25:39 I think unironically having children seems like the American way.
00:25:42 You can never have a son.
00:25:44 In time.
00:25:45 Well, it never works for our dad.
00:25:46 We never did our fucking dishes.
00:25:48 He will use dishes and he will not wash them up and then you'll have to wash them.
00:25:52 Well, that's unfortunate too, I guess.
00:25:55 Okay.
00:25:56 Ben, you didn't like the way this podcast started out, but I've got a segue for you.
00:26:01 Free of charge, although you do owe me interest.
00:26:05 I heard that you ripped me off and I heard that you followed my footsteps
00:26:10 trying to eat some of the same glory that I achieved in the procrastiners' pockets
00:26:14 and you went to a political rally.
00:26:17 Oh, God.
00:26:18 Oh, yeah.
00:26:19 That's right.
00:26:20 I did.
00:26:21 Yeah, I went to a Yang rally.
00:26:22 That's boyish.
00:26:23 Yeah.
00:26:24 You know, a lot happened this week, like way more than usually happens in a week for me.
00:26:29 So like, I'm like forgetting some details, but yeah, I went to a Yang rally.
00:26:34 Thursday, I think.
00:26:36 And I just barely missed the chance to get a photo with the guy.
00:26:41 I'm so pissed because I didn't think he was doing that.
00:26:45 I didn't think I could shake hands and take a photo with him and I really had to pee,
00:26:50 so I went to go find a bathroom and I came back and I saw,
00:26:53 no, he was fucking taking photos with people and shaking their hands.
00:26:56 Not wearing a diaper to the rally.
00:26:58 So I got in line, but it was too late.
00:27:00 It was too fucking late.
00:27:02 He was sick of us, I know.
00:27:04 Ben, Ben, did you see the article that I tweeted like two days ago?
00:27:09 The hologram.
00:27:10 Yes.
00:27:11 How he wants to have used like the hologram technology to have rallies at multiple locations.
00:27:15 Oh, like the Miku technology.
00:27:16 Yeah.
00:27:17 That's pretty funny.
00:27:18 I'm not sure that's real.
00:27:19 Like that he's really going to do that, but it would be really funny if he did.
00:27:23 As long as it was marketed as like, it's not really me guys, it's a hologram.
00:27:26 That sounds great.
00:27:27 That sounds fine.
00:27:28 That's really going to appeal to the Midwestern truckers,
00:27:31 whose jobs he's out to protect.
00:27:33 That's how you get through to those people.
00:27:35 I have to ask you Ben, because I want to know how similar it was to the Bernie rally.
00:27:38 Because Bernie was, there was a lot of build up to Bernie.
00:27:41 There was like hours of just like, you know, people warming us up with the crowd.
00:27:46 And then Bernie came on and he just said,
00:27:48 I'm Bernie Sanders.
00:27:49 Here's what I've said.
00:27:50 Here it is again.
00:27:52 Goodbye America.
00:27:53 And then he left.
00:27:55 How old was Yang?
00:27:56 Did he have any personality?
00:27:57 And then he left America and pledges loyalty to Putin for once and all.
00:28:01 Okay.
00:28:02 So the Yang rally was basically like, I got there a little bit early.
00:28:05 I was just going to hang in it.
00:28:06 We were just going to hang it out around sort of a pagoda munchie.
00:28:11 Actually, do you remember the place in Boston?
00:28:13 Of course.
00:28:14 I know exactly the way.
00:28:15 I saw one, I saw like, like just the zoomed in shot of Yang talking.
00:28:19 I could tell exactly where it was.
00:28:21 I know exactly where.
00:28:22 We made our slime court pact that we've never acknowledged what the logo looks like.
00:28:28 Yeah, that's right.
00:28:29 It's the, yep, that exact one.
00:28:31 He was, he was, well, okay.
00:28:32 So I got there and at some point they like got like a group of like tastefully ethnically
00:28:39 diverse, like you young people to get up there with Yang signs and like sort of stand as
00:28:45 like a backdrop sort of up on the podium, just sort of looking nice.
00:28:49 Was the crowd just a few too many white faces out there to make everybody comfortable?
00:28:54 A lot of Asians actually.
00:28:55 A lot of Asians in whites in Boston.
00:28:57 There was like, the crowd was like almost half Asian, I think.
00:29:00 Yeah, okay.
00:29:01 But anyway.
00:29:02 Is that how I take people to the fast one?
00:29:04 Yeah, yeah, true, but he doesn't push that.
00:29:06 Like he almost like, he almost like deliberately backs off from like that.
00:29:10 Like whenever, when anyone ever asks, when anyone asks him about like, you know, being
00:29:15 an Asian American running for president, he, he, he's like, you know, I'm not really,
00:29:19 you know, like that's not really.
00:29:21 Well, everybody knows the identity politics stack Asians do not fare well because they're
00:29:25 doing so well in America.
00:29:26 So, but okay, fair enough, fair enough.
00:29:28 Yeah, whatever.
00:29:30 But anyway, so he's, so there's a bunch of people up there and then this like young,
00:29:35 it's like maybe like 25.
00:29:38 So like girl is like, she's like, she's like out, she's asking people like, you know,
00:29:43 crowd in around the podium, crowd in around the, the pagoda or whatever, like getting
00:29:47 closer.
00:29:48 And so we do that.
00:29:49 And then we wait a little while and then she gets up there and she's, I don't know,
00:29:53 she's tired.
00:29:54 Oh, there was one like troll guy walking around with a Keckistan flag.
00:29:58 But he didn't.
00:29:59 Yeah, but he didn't do anything.
00:30:01 That was, that was me.
00:30:03 I don't know if I mentioned this, but at the, at the brand rally, there, there were some,
00:30:07 there were some, uh, maybe make America great again, had men.
00:30:12 They were reasonably well behaved or something.
00:30:14 So like, what's their game?
00:30:15 Like, okay, I understand you might want to just be informed or something.
00:30:18 And you want to show up and just hang out and see what the opposition has to say.
00:30:21 But like, then you, then you dress up in the cosplay and I'm like, well, you don't do anything.
00:30:26 I literally heard some people like pointing out the Keckistan flag guy and be, and like
00:30:31 talking about him.
00:30:32 And like they knew who he was.
00:30:33 He like went to their school and he was just like a troll or something.
00:30:37 Apparently he like goes to like left wing shit, uh, around like just to troll people.
00:30:44 So like pretty lame to just like be, uh, the object of like the opposition, but to not
00:30:51 be doing anything.
00:30:53 Just be like, I'm here to remind you.
00:30:55 What should he do?
00:30:56 Firebomb the stage?
00:30:57 No, I mean, it's just people are empty.
00:31:00 That's, people have no souls.
00:31:02 All they want to do is just be a nuisance.
00:31:04 It's the same argument about everybody going to support Yang.
00:31:07 They're just going like the hell.
00:31:09 I was annoyed when I saw him, but he didn't do anything.
00:31:13 So in the end I was like, well, whatever.
00:31:15 It's fine.
00:31:16 What I'm thinking is like, it's equivalent to like putting on a specific like anime or
00:31:23 like pop culture t-shirt and walking around and hoping somebody will talk about it.
00:31:28 Okay.
00:31:29 The thing is though, that literally defines my entire adult life.
00:31:32 I get that they like people do these kinds of things because they think that they're
00:31:37 trolling, but it's like if you're just going to a place where you know you're not wanted
00:31:42 and dressing in the cosplay specifically just to make people mad at you, then you're not
00:31:49 really trolling.
00:31:50 You're just a faggot.
00:31:51 Well, you know what it was.
00:31:53 The reason he did it, the reason he did it is because of any kind.
00:31:58 You're totally inside.
00:32:00 Sure.
00:32:01 Because those guys knew who he was, right?
00:32:03 They're like, oh, it's that guy.
00:32:04 It's that guy who shows up to the damn rallies with the Kekistan flag.
00:32:08 So like, you know, yeah, yeah, it was, you know, I've got a reputation now.
00:32:13 He's that guy.
00:32:14 Everyone knows him as that guy.
00:32:15 Everyone knows him as having like a reputation of like, oh, that famous guy who, you know,
00:32:19 doesn't-
00:32:20 Oh, yeah.
00:32:21 Everyone knows that guy.
00:32:22 The Kekistan guy?
00:32:23 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:32:24 We all sure hate that guy.
00:32:25 We all sure hate that guy, but damn if we don't respect that guy.
00:32:29 The way to steal that, the most charitable interpretation is maybe he is here to like,
00:32:34 literally in his own way, politically advocate for whatever he, you know, the, I don't know,
00:32:39 the left or something.
00:32:40 I don't know.
00:32:41 I guess maybe, you know, I don't, I mean, it's fine.
00:32:45 I'm sure that's fine.
00:32:46 Either way, it's fine.
00:32:47 It's all fine.
00:32:48 Yeah, okay.
00:32:49 It's all good.
00:32:50 There's a guy.
00:32:51 Maybe they'll see the Kekistan flag.
00:32:52 Maybe they'll realize that their policies are stupid.
00:32:54 Maybe if they see this funny meme, then they'll not see it.
00:32:57 They'll not see it.
00:32:58 You could argue that about every individual action anyone takes in a political space.
00:33:02 So, you know.
00:33:03 But it's about the...
00:33:04 So, the way that, the way the rally went, right?
00:33:07 Like that, that like young woman talked for a little while.
00:33:11 She just, I don't even remember what she said.
00:33:13 It was like inconsequential.
00:33:14 She was like sort of hyping the crowd up a little bit.
00:33:16 Then like this, I'll just, I'm just going to say it.
00:33:21 I'm just going to say the F word.
00:33:23 Fat woman.
00:33:24 This fat woman.
00:33:25 This fat woman.
00:33:26 This, this, this.
00:33:27 She came up on the podium and she...
00:33:30 She's still fat, Ben.
00:33:32 She's still fat.
00:33:33 Okay, whatever.
00:33:34 She, whatever.
00:33:35 She was like, she runs like the local like Yang gang, like, like chapter meetups or something.
00:33:39 And she was like, she's, you know, she sort of introduced that and her organization.
00:33:43 Oh, and they were hyping up them.
00:33:45 They were hyping up that Yang was going to be on like a CNN thing.
00:33:49 Like right before Game of Thrones.
00:33:51 So, they were...
00:33:52 We're just tonight, by the way.
00:33:53 Oh, shit.
00:33:54 Okay.
00:33:55 Well, so, okay.
00:33:56 Then maybe before Game of Thrones, tune in an hour early and see Yang on CNN or something.
00:34:00 Tune in like five days ago.
00:34:01 They were, they were pushing, they were pushing a thing like, like share the Yang CNN thing
00:34:06 and like organize Game of Thrones watch parties, but like start them an hour early and like
00:34:12 get people to like, or like have a, have a sort of a combined, have a Yang little like
00:34:17 Yang viewing, combine it with your game.
00:34:19 Combine it with your Game of Thrones.
00:34:20 Gang of Thrones.
00:34:21 And then, and then hashtag it, tweet about it, you know, invite everyone.
00:34:24 You know, that, that was so part of how they were promoting it.
00:34:27 Is, is being, is being a fat woman and being in political like actions like that.
00:34:32 Is that the left-wing equivalent of running around with the Kekestan flag?
00:34:36 Like, it seems like the same thing.
00:34:38 To take the most possible interpretation of politically active fat people, they were
00:34:43 not able to master their own like physical self.
00:34:47 And so they're like, ah, we'll fix society, that will fix my life for me.
00:34:51 You could say that about anything a fat person does.
00:34:56 You could say that about anything a fat person does.
00:34:59 Totally uncharitable, totally unfair.
00:35:01 Very mean.
00:35:02 It was, it was all for the games.
00:35:04 But, but anyway, so she talked and then she introduced some guy who I had never heard of,
00:35:10 but who was a business guy, question mark, question mark.
00:35:13 Donald Trump?
00:35:14 Don't know that guy.
00:35:15 He like, he, he had like known Yang for a while and he got up there and he was like,
00:35:19 yeah, we met at a wedding, a mutual friend a while ago.
00:35:22 He got married.
00:35:23 He told me he was running for president and I said, you're crazy man, better you than
00:35:27 me.
00:35:28 Haha, that's my anecdote.
00:35:29 All right.
00:35:30 Anyway, give it up for Andrew Yang.
00:35:31 What is this shit?
00:35:32 And Andrew Yang comes out.
00:35:34 Hey, so I know Andrew Yang.
00:35:36 He says he's running for president.
00:35:37 You know, that's cool.
00:35:38 Anyway, see you later guys.
00:35:40 Nice to see you.
00:35:42 Follow me on Instagram.
00:35:44 So, so, so here's Andrew and then it was really funny.
00:35:47 Yang comes out and he is sort of like, he sort of has maybe a little bit of like a rockstar
00:35:54 affectation about him.
00:35:56 I know.
00:35:57 I saw a clip.
00:35:58 He's like, okay, Bernie's behind a podium pound, pounding the podium, acting like a politician
00:36:04 and then Yang's like destroying podiums that bring out new podiums one after another.
00:36:08 Yeah, exactly.
00:36:09 Yang like jumps out.
00:36:10 He's where he like kind of runs out on those.
00:36:12 He's like, hey, and he's wearing like this big like American flag like scarf around his
00:36:17 neck and it's sort of hanging and it's like, you know, it's, it's, it's kind of, it's
00:36:22 a little bit cool.
00:36:23 Open mic night.
00:36:24 It was really weird.
00:36:26 He has, he's okay.
00:36:27 I mean, he mostly just sort of repeated his normal talking points.
00:36:30 So yeah, like he didn't say anything new, but like he, he, he, I mean, he wasn't all
00:36:36 stuff I heard before.
00:36:37 Like he did a bunch of like, I mean, I can't.
00:36:39 I mean, I can't remember him on the spot.
00:36:41 He's basically a single issue guy.
00:36:42 So like it's fair.
00:36:43 Well, not, not, not really actually.
00:36:45 I mean, he's got the, he didn't, he actually didn't emphasize the UBI that much.
00:36:52 Like he, he mentioned it sort of in passing, but like that wasn't like his focus, his focus
00:36:56 on like, you know, technology and, and fucking, you know, job security and speaking to the
00:37:03 Asian crowd.
00:37:04 So he knows they're fine for money.
00:37:06 Don't need to emphasize.
00:37:07 He talked about, you know, like student loan forgiveness and Medicare for all, Medicare
00:37:12 for all.
00:37:13 And you know, he mentioned the UBI, but it wasn't like the thing he focused on.
00:37:17 And he said shit at one point.
00:37:19 Oh, he dropped, he dropped an S-bow.
00:37:21 Holy.
00:37:22 Uh-huh.
00:37:23 And he was just kind of like jokie and like sort of casual about it.
00:37:26 Did he come off as natural and cool or was he sticking the mud?
00:37:29 He was pretty dumb and drool.
00:37:31 I guess he was pretty natural.
00:37:33 No, no, no.
00:37:34 This is what happened.
00:37:35 He was just hanging around doing this thing, being, being cool.
00:37:37 And then all of a sudden-
00:37:38 He's just being cool.
00:37:39 He pulls out his just being cool.
00:37:40 I was going to say he unbuttons his blazer and under there is his, I'm just being cool
00:37:43 T-shirt.
00:37:44 Be like Yang, everyone.
00:37:45 Is that Ben Satan the crowd?
00:37:46 Let's get him up here, ladies and gentlemen.
00:37:48 He's just being cool.
00:37:49 So am I.
00:37:50 By the way, I want to say I was wearing my homemade or my self-made purple like Yang 2020
00:37:56 like, like sunset pattern like T-shirt to the rail.
00:37:59 Yeah.
00:38:00 Right.
00:38:01 And uh, wait there.
00:38:02 Okay.
00:38:03 Okay.
00:38:04 I, I like him a lot.
00:38:05 I like all his policies, but there are a couple of things that he does that I kind of wish
00:38:10 he wouldn't and kind of wish think are hurting him like he has this line that he says all
00:38:15 the time.
00:38:16 Okay.
00:38:17 First of all, him, him leaning on the math thing, like I don't get the sense that he's
00:38:21 like a real like, okay, he's an entrepreneur and a businessman.
00:38:26 I'm sure he knows math.
00:38:27 I'm sure he's good at math.
00:38:29 But all right, I was, I was talking to some of my other friends were there at the rally
00:38:33 with me and, um, we were talking about it and one of them said like, you know, I get
00:38:37 the feeling like from his college photos that Yang's not like a nerdy Asian.
00:38:42 Like he's like presenting himself that he's more of like a cool Asian who wore like leather
00:38:46 jackets and like looked good and was crazy rich Asian, one of that crap.
00:38:51 And I, and I, it kind of seems like maybe the whole math thing is just sort of playing
00:38:54 into maybe a stereotype that he thinks would play better.
00:38:57 And I don't, I don't, I don't really get the sense that he's as much of a nerd as he's
00:39:02 like making himself out to be.
00:39:04 And the one thing that I wish he would please stop is at the end, like this is sort of his
00:39:07 line.
00:39:08 He says it at the end of everything.
00:39:09 He says the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian guy who likes math.
00:39:15 And I think that is like the cringiest, stupidest line.
00:39:19 That's really awful.
00:39:21 It's really dumb.
00:39:22 I get it.
00:39:23 I've never heard him say that.
00:39:24 I've watched a couple of things that he's done.
00:39:26 He said, he said it in a couple interviews and he said it at the end of this speech.
00:39:30 And every time he says it, I'm like, please stop leaning on that.
00:39:33 I know it's like, ha, ha.
00:39:35 It's a joke about my ethnicity.
00:39:36 What happened to his other catch for the catch phrase I've heard him say a lot is like, it's
00:39:41 not left or right.
00:39:42 It's forward.
00:39:43 And I thought that was.
00:39:44 Oh, sure.
00:39:45 Well, he, he says that too.
00:39:46 Something that he just said once and then some campaign manager was like, yes, keep
00:39:49 saying that.
00:39:50 Say that over and over again.
00:39:52 People will love it.
00:39:53 Which the Asian thing or the left, right thing?
00:39:54 The Donald.
00:39:55 The Asian thing.
00:39:56 Probably both.
00:39:57 The opposite of Donald Trump.
00:39:58 He plays well with a certain crowd, but I hate that crowd and I don't want to be a part
00:40:03 of it.
00:40:04 Agreed.
00:40:05 You know, again, so not.
00:40:06 I kind of like, I think his whole math thing probably plays well with like a nerdy, like
00:40:09 Reddit, like a self-proclaimed nerdy, like Reddit browsing, like, fuck yeah, science
00:40:13 kind of crowd.
00:40:14 I hate him too.
00:40:15 I will want to say that through watching the bachelor and the bachelor, I've concluded
00:40:24 that every single normal person on earth would describe themselves as a nerd.
00:40:31 I don't know.
00:40:32 Not me.
00:40:33 Deliciously.
00:40:34 I'm post that.
00:40:35 I'm post.
00:40:36 I'm post.
00:40:37 Nerds are cool.
00:40:38 You're an actual nerd.
00:40:39 He's older than you.
00:40:40 You're an actual nerd.
00:40:41 Is what I'm saying that normies think being a nerd is like quirky and cute and they'll
00:40:43 describe.
00:40:44 Yeah.
00:40:45 Such given.
00:40:46 Yeah.
00:40:47 Opportunity to do so.
00:40:48 You ask anyone off the street.
00:40:49 They'll say, yeah, I'm a nerd.
00:40:50 I've like read a book.
00:40:52 Yeah.
00:40:53 No, I know.
00:40:54 I know.
00:40:55 I know that you're right.
00:40:56 I am so anti the watering down of the word nerd.
00:40:58 Like nerd.
00:40:59 I agree.
00:41:00 Should be an insult.
00:41:01 It should be an insult.
00:41:02 It should be the worst insult ever.
00:41:03 If I see someone who's just totally socially incompetent, just a slobbering, like more
00:41:08 chins than they have like follicles of hair, fucking, you know, stomping down the boulevard,
00:41:15 you know, a person who's on 4chan all day, you know, who's just shit.
00:41:19 That's a nerd.
00:41:20 You should be able to say, hey, you're a fucking nerd without people co-op.
00:41:24 Yeah.
00:41:25 I'm a nerd because I watch Game of Thrones.
00:41:26 No, you're not.
00:41:27 Yeah, exactly.
00:41:28 You're just normal.
00:41:31 The words are evolving.
00:41:32 They're just changing.
00:41:33 They're shifting under our feet.
00:41:34 Can you believe?
00:41:35 Can you believe?
00:41:36 Press B.
00:41:37 Press B to go back.
00:41:38 Oh, man.
00:41:39 Press B to stop the evolution.
00:41:40 You see, you see, dude, I'm so, dude, I'm so hype for a, I'm so hype for Shazam.
00:41:43 Yeah, I'm such a nerd.
00:41:45 Yeah.
00:41:46 Yeah.
00:41:47 That's my whole thing.
00:41:48 That's like my whole thing basically.
00:41:49 I don't want to see that movie.
00:41:50 It looks pretty good.
00:41:51 Hey, so I went, I've done a little further research since we last spoke about Yang and
00:41:55 it was just that all I did, nothing incredible was I watched like the Ben Shapiro versus Yang
00:41:59 debate.
00:42:00 Yeah.
00:42:01 I haven't seen that.
00:42:02 That was, that was, I liked that one in particular because it was definitely adversarial.
00:42:07 And so that was like good to see someone on the opposite side debating him.
00:42:10 Yang came away looking pretty good overall in that.
00:42:14 I think I'd probably like him more than before I watched that.
00:42:18 I agree.
00:42:19 He really does lean into his business side in a way that is comforting for someone like
00:42:24 me who is my alarm bells of just like, oh, we're just trying to like, you know, siphon
00:42:29 money away from people who are, you know, whatever, doing better to people who will
00:42:33 just fuck it up anyway, which I mean, still could happen.
00:42:36 But I don't know.
00:42:37 There's lots of questions about if this would work anyway.
00:42:39 But yeah, I don't know.
00:42:41 So the thing about Yang and really all politicians, and I don't say this to really shit on Yang,
00:42:46 but your, your description of him coming out like a rock star really makes me think about
00:42:50 how like, God, I hate the reality that we have like, it's the cool kids.
00:42:56 It is now officially the cool kids who become our leaders and politicians when God, I yearn
00:43:03 for the Nixon era.
00:43:04 I want a curmudgeonly weird, slobbery old nerd, a fucking weirdo freak asshole.
00:43:11 And sure, maybe Nixon was a bad guy, whatever.
00:43:13 But I want a freak.
00:43:14 Sure, you had some faults.
00:43:15 You know what?
00:43:16 You're over that.
00:43:17 Yeah.
00:43:18 Nate, have you seen that movie?
00:43:20 Oh God, I think it's called Frost Nixon or a little, hold on, hold on, that's the interview.
00:43:26 It's the interview, right?
00:43:27 It's a, it's a, yeah, it's called Frost Nixon and it is a, it's a movie that is like based
00:43:32 on the interviews.
00:43:33 I saw much of it.
00:43:34 Yes.
00:43:35 I watched it.
00:43:36 I think YMS recommended it and that's why I watched it.
00:43:39 Okay.
00:43:40 All I want to say about that is that, yeah, in that movie, they like, like Nixon is a
00:43:45 pretty old man.
00:43:46 Like he's got to be like 60, but like, they pushed the idea that Nixon is like really
00:43:51 sexy.
00:43:52 Like they say he's sexy.
00:43:54 Like, no, like, like, yeah, like, like before, well, it's just funny because like, like he's
00:43:59 still old, but like they, like, I think before Nixon ever, it's like before anyone sees him
00:44:06 before he appears on screen, like the love interests, I remember, she says like a sultry
00:44:10 way.
00:44:11 They're talking about, like, wait, we're gonna be, we're gonna go meet Richard Nixon.
00:44:15 You mean president Richard Nixon?
00:44:17 You know, I hear he has the sexiest voice.
00:44:20 I am not a fucking...
00:44:22 Well, and then in the movie, he is played by someone with like an extremely dulcet,
00:44:27 like baritone.
00:44:28 Well, that's a little odd.
00:44:29 I mean, power is sexy.
00:44:30 But it doesn't, but it doesn't sound completely unlike him.
00:44:34 So like, it doesn't, it sort of works.
00:44:36 They sort of pull it off, but like in hindsight, you're like, boy, that was really weird.
00:44:40 They sold me on this idea that Nixon was like the sexy guy.
00:44:43 And you know what, maybe I'm a little, I didn't live through the Nixon era, obviously, but
00:44:47 like maybe I'm being sold in a completely opposite direction that he is in fact, like
00:44:52 a weird old troll, but that's, that's what I've come to understand.
00:44:55 But my point is like, I want academics and like scientists and like smart people like
00:45:00 that.
00:45:01 It's just that those people are doing things.
00:45:04 I don't think a scientist has ever been the president.
00:45:06 I don't think like, like a real academic has never been the president.
00:45:11 I think like Eisenhower made a lot of sense.
00:45:13 Like World War II, you know, leader or whatever.
00:45:16 And I think he went on to become president.
00:45:17 That seemed like a pretty good choice to me.
00:45:19 That guy knows what's up on like the world stage and whatnot.
00:45:22 This like, I don't know, businessman like Wall Street stuff.
00:45:25 I don't know.
00:45:26 Obama was okay, I guess, is like a pick.
00:45:28 But I don't know.
00:45:29 I want someone who's like a real old fuck.
00:45:31 Who just knows shit.
00:45:32 I want an old, I liked an old fuck for president.
00:45:35 Yeah.
00:45:36 Make that a shirt.
00:45:37 Make that a shirt just like the American flag in the background and like an old 2020
00:45:41 and an old fuck for specifically not one who's been in nothing but Pollock.
00:45:45 I want like a general.
00:45:46 I feel like generals are a good choice.
00:45:47 I don't want a fuck.
00:45:49 I don't want a military guy liked by anyone because as soon as a candidate is like, then
00:45:54 they have a group.
00:45:56 And once they have a group, that's when, you know, groups breed stupidity.
00:45:59 I want a president to get in somehow with no votes.
00:46:02 I want them to just take over.
00:46:03 I want to say, Justin, you seem to be an object of democracy as a group.
00:46:07 I want Ebenezer Scrooge to rise from the grave on a pale horse and take America by force.
00:46:14 Ebenezer.
00:46:15 King George III needs to arise from the grave and be like, look what you fucking retards
00:46:20 did.
00:46:21 It took a while, but the whole system broke down.
00:46:23 You know, the reason why Eisenhower comes to my mind is like a good, it's because like
00:46:26 he was like a World War II general that like everyone in the world is like, oh, those were
00:46:31 the good guys.
00:46:32 But like now what we have is like, I mean, to a degree, it's like, oh, let's go invade
00:46:36 some more Middle Eastern countries to acquire more resources.
00:46:39 I don't want one of those guys.
00:46:40 This is why I'm kind of, I don't know.
00:46:44 You know, I've only seen a little bit of, oh God, is it Kamala Harris?
00:46:47 Yeah.
00:46:48 Kamala Harris, she's a veteran, right?
00:46:50 No, you're thinking of Tulsi Gabbard, I think.
00:46:52 Tulsi Gabbard.
00:46:53 Yeah, Tulsi Gabbard.
00:46:54 Gabbard.
00:46:55 I don't know if it's just that everyone, whatever, I've heard it both ways.
00:46:59 Well, I don't know if it's maybe just that people ask her about her like, like, like
00:47:04 foreign policy opinions more often, so she ends up talking about it.
00:47:07 But every time, every time I hear her talking, she's talking about like some fucking foreign
00:47:12 policy, like military shit and like, I don't care about that.
00:47:15 I don't want to lean into that.
00:47:16 I kind of think maybe we should not have a veteran for president.
00:47:19 But Ben, but Ben.
00:47:20 I don't want a military guy.
00:47:21 I don't want to fucking care about that.
00:47:23 We got to pull out of foreign entanglements, please.
00:47:25 That she wants to do less of it is her whole point.
00:47:27 That's why she's talking about it.
00:47:29 That's like her main.
00:47:30 Is that her main thing?
00:47:31 Yeah.
00:47:32 Absolutely.
00:47:33 Absolutely.
00:47:34 Oh, God.
00:47:35 Oh, God, I spoke out of turn.
00:47:36 I spoke out of turn and I made an ass of myself.
00:47:37 Oh, God.
00:47:38 Okay.
00:47:39 Well, I want to say Buttigieg is also a veteran, but I've heard him say, like, we need to like,
00:47:42 you know, end foreign entanglements and like do less of that whole like foreign fucking.
00:47:46 Yeah.
00:47:47 I mean, obviously, I think we've most of us are here, but.
00:47:49 Okay.
00:47:50 Nah, I'm for war.
00:47:51 More war, please.
00:47:52 Yes.
00:47:53 The ever popular for war position.
00:47:55 I need four wars per year.
00:47:58 Yeah.
00:47:59 I'm four, four wars.
00:48:01 Four wars.
00:48:02 Year.
00:48:03 You can make like a Japanese haiku that's like, ah, yes, in the fall, I commit, I commit
00:48:09 war in the winter.
00:48:10 I commit second war in the spring.
00:48:12 It is time for more war.
00:48:14 And in the summer, I settle down to yet another war and life goes on.
00:48:17 It's like the hobbit and Lord of the Rings, like, yes, but what about second war?
00:48:22 We defeated so about second war, we need to fight again that literally happens in the
00:48:36 books, too.
00:48:37 After they have second war and they fight Saruman.
00:48:42 That's true.
00:48:43 They just can't get enough of those greedy fucks.
00:48:48 Well, we blend a lot here today.
00:48:52 Did you include everything about the Yang Gang rally, Ben?
00:48:55 Oh, yeah.
00:48:56 Any closing thoughts on that?
00:48:57 Oh, I mean, that was pretty much it.
00:48:59 That was what happened.
00:49:00 That was what the speech was like.
00:49:01 Was it fun?
00:49:02 Did it not make you want to die?
00:49:03 Like how the burning rally made me want to die?
00:49:04 That's a fair question.
00:49:05 No, it was fine.
00:49:07 The only thing that made me want to die is that I missed my chance to get a picture
00:49:09 with them.
00:49:10 Yeah, fair enough.
00:49:11 And you know, I don't know, like, I'm not even with, I don't know, I don't even feel
00:49:14 like I came across particularly anti-Yang here or anything like it's just like political
00:49:19 the political arena is so inherently, I don't know, like it's all it's very unfortunate
00:49:23 that it is like, like it is.
00:49:25 If you know what I mean, ladies, people don't think it'd be like it is, but it do, but it
00:49:30 absolutely do.
00:49:31 And no one can argue that fucking try and prove me wrong.
00:49:37 Stephen Crowder sign.
00:49:39 Some don't think it'd be like it is, but it do change my mind.
00:49:42 Yeah.
00:49:43 Okay.
00:49:44 Anyway, I knew what else is going on ladies and gentlemen.
00:49:47 So yeah, that's it.
00:49:49 Yang Gang, pretty good, better than Bernie, I would say, by a narrow margin, but a narrow
00:49:55 but undeniable margin.
00:49:57 Yeah.
00:49:58 Okay.
00:49:59 All right.
00:50:00 Hey, I went to that.
00:50:01 Oh, well, I can let someone else talk.
00:50:02 I've been going for a while.
00:50:03 I know what you're going to talk about and I do want to circle back to that.
00:50:06 Okay.
00:50:07 Yeah.
00:50:08 Hey, last point on this like, I don't know, political tinged discussion here is I was
00:50:12 Ben, I realized there's one area of this whole communist ideology that you 100% are for and
00:50:18 back.
00:50:19 Yeah, that's right.
00:50:20 And I realized that the prospect that you are always on about about state mandated GFs
00:50:25 and equal distribution of sex.
00:50:27 I'm all for.
00:50:28 Wait, hold on.
00:50:29 And you might say, but how are you going to handle like what about the consent issue
00:50:33 of state mandated GFs?
00:50:35 Well, that's exactly why we need equal distribution of consent as well that I'm all for.
00:50:41 Spread it thin.
00:50:42 So like everyone's sort of okay, you know, you know, in this country, but Ben St. doesn't
00:50:48 consent.
00:50:49 Well, is it not rape?
00:50:50 You know, the gulf, the gulf is white.
00:50:53 The consent gulf is widening in this country, you know, 1% of the people receive 99% of
00:50:59 the consent.
00:51:00 It's not fair.
00:51:01 It's not fair.
00:51:02 And what is that?
00:51:03 It's literally true.
00:51:04 Nothing at all.
00:51:05 We have to fix it.
00:51:06 Yeah.
00:51:07 And I mean, you know, when you, when you got your state mandated GF, she'll be thanking
00:51:10 you for impregnating her so that her state imposed explosive collar does not detonate
00:51:15 because it detects the pregnancy.
00:51:17 So really you'll be doing her a favor in the end of the day.
00:51:19 Wow.
00:51:20 You thought of everything.
00:51:21 It's a brave new future that I'm looking forward to.
00:51:24 But that's all.
00:51:25 That's all.
00:51:26 So you got my vote, Yang.
00:51:27 Yeah.
00:51:28 Man, I'm going to vote for him twice now.
00:51:31 Okay.
00:51:32 Yeah.
00:51:33 All right.
00:51:34 Oh, what do you got?
00:51:35 What do you got?
00:51:36 Oh, what do you got?
00:51:37 What do you got?
00:51:38 I was going to talk to you about something hippo and you too Nate, because as we, as we
00:51:43 know, something happened yesterday, yesterday, what happened?
00:51:47 Oh, yeah.
00:51:48 Oh, yeah.
00:51:49 Oh, of course.
00:51:50 Now I remember.
00:51:51 Yep.
00:51:52 Okay.
00:51:53 I'm with you.
00:51:54 Oh, yeah.
00:51:55 It's sort of unfortunate that we titled the last episode Homestuck because truly this
00:51:58 is the Homestuck episode because the first Homestuck epilogue came out.
00:52:02 Now I was a vocal.
00:52:03 I did not think this would happen on 4.30.
00:52:06 I did not think that it would ever happen if I'm honest with you.
00:52:09 I gave up.
00:52:10 But it did.
00:52:11 The first thing came out and we have some thoughts on it.
00:52:14 Wait.
00:52:15 It's the 10-year anniversary of Homestuck.
00:52:16 Yeah.
00:52:17 4.13 yesterday was 10 years from the release date.
00:52:19 Wait.
00:52:20 And what happened?
00:52:21 Basically nothing.
00:52:22 Basically.
00:52:23 All right.
00:52:24 I wouldn't worry about it.
00:52:26 Yeah.
00:52:27 Well, I'm just going to tune out for this part then.
00:52:30 Yeah.
00:52:31 Yeah.
00:52:32 It was the beginning of a series of epilogues to Homestuck, the prologue of the epilogues.
00:52:38 And by the way, it's only written word, no images.
00:52:41 Yeah.
00:52:42 Written word.
00:52:43 It's a sort of like written as if it were a fanfic about Homestuck but written by Andrew
00:52:49 Hussey and two other people, one of which is also an actual like Homestuck fanfic guy.
00:52:55 I learned.
00:52:56 So he teamed up with a Homestuck fanfic guy and someone else to write a post-canon but
00:53:03 still actually canon epilogue to Homestuck.
00:53:07 And it details a little bit of information about like John and Rose talking about John
00:53:15 doing a thing that happens in the comic that we didn't get to see in detail before.
00:53:21 So you know, it was an interesting like jokey sort of, what's the word, display, like in
00:53:31 the form of a fanfiction, having all this stuff, he had a whole like first page with
00:53:38 a bunch of like tags, like Archive of our Own, which was a nice touch.
00:53:45 Yeah.
00:53:46 And I read it and I kind of liked it, but a lot of people are just mad because it's they
00:53:50 hate Homestuck now.
00:53:51 That's me, baby.
00:53:52 Right over here.
00:53:53 It is exactly what it may sound like and that's weird, flowery fanfic tier writing.
00:54:00 Absolutely.
00:54:01 But it's on purpose.
00:54:02 It's a big brain intellectual that's like, well, you're the idiot for not getting it.
00:54:06 I mean, it wasn't like written as if it was a bad fanfic.
00:54:09 Like it's still like competent.
00:54:10 Yeah.
00:54:11 Well, okay.
00:54:12 They're trying to like, I don't think, okay, it only comes across in the, in like the format
00:54:17 of it where there's pros and then there's dialogue sections and, you know, obviously
00:54:21 the whole like aesthetic way it's presented.
00:54:24 But I don't know.
00:54:25 I don't really get the sense they're trying to make it like a fanfiction, though I guess
00:54:29 I could be wrong in the sense of like writing because it doesn't, they don't lean into it.
00:54:33 I wouldn't say it.
00:54:34 I think you just presented it that way.
00:54:35 What do you mean they?
00:54:36 Wasn't it written by Andrew Hussey?
00:54:37 No.
00:54:38 I said two people.
00:54:39 Andrew Hussey and two other people.
00:54:40 Oh God.
00:54:41 See, this is what I hate about Homestuck because it's not written by Hussey anymore.
00:54:45 Well, the parts he did write are like maybe the worst parts of it possibly.
00:54:53 He wrote the title.
00:54:54 Wait.
00:54:55 You know what?
00:54:56 I think Homestuck's dead.
00:54:57 I actually don't know who reward I assume he wrote the title.
00:54:58 I said, you know what?
00:54:59 I think Homestuck's dead to me.
00:55:00 I mean, that's how it feels.
00:55:03 I mean, I was, I was thinking about like how this feels like I would be mad if I thought
00:55:10 Homestuck was still alive, but it feels more like an autopsy, but not even like in a bad
00:55:15 way.
00:55:16 I'm just interested to see what, what comes from this.
00:55:18 That's, that's fair.
00:55:19 I wasn't really, I wasn't really waiting for the epilogue.
00:55:21 I wasn't really like, oh, I really want the epilogue.
00:55:24 It will fix everything.
00:55:25 I'm just like, well, now it's here and I'm reading it and it's like, yeah, all right.
00:55:30 People who say like they were waiting for the epilogue to fix things have a completely
00:55:35 like a different understanding of what made Homestuck bad than I do.
00:55:40 There's nothing to fix.
00:55:42 I don't give a shit if you like, oh, they go by and they'll go, they go back and fight
00:55:47 Lord English, which is what's happening in this epilogue, like, like we have, like we
00:55:50 just literally see the fight.
00:55:52 Oh, don't, Homestuck's fixed now.
00:55:54 That's completely separate from the issues.
00:55:56 You can't like, the only way to fix Homestuck is to literally just rewrite it.
00:56:01 I don't care the structural plot.
00:56:02 I care at the moment to moment dialogue that just tanked and went to shit and is still
00:56:08 bad now.
00:56:09 That's fair.
00:56:10 I mean, so there's a lot of meta things going on with it that I don't even hate it.
00:56:16 It just was boring to me.
00:56:18 This epilogue, like, it does not enrage me in the same way an axis thing was where I
00:56:22 feel like I'm just completely wasting my time.
00:56:26 It's so short and just boring.
00:56:28 It's just boring and I don't, I don't care.
00:56:30 And I wasn't expecting the same way.
00:56:32 It doesn't matter.
00:56:33 I give it a little more criticism specifically because what is attempted, like, okay, there
00:56:37 are specific, in the dialogue, they talk about like, okay, the first thing is when John talks
00:56:42 to Rose, I guess spoilers, go read it's like three, it's several pages long or whatever.
00:56:45 It's like three pages.
00:56:46 It's nothing.
00:56:47 But they're really long pages.
00:56:48 But whatever, take a couple minutes.
00:56:49 Like, so when, when John talks to Rose, they are discussing like how there's a danger happening
00:56:55 and the way that it's introduced is like in the lore of this new Homestuck epilogue thing.
00:57:01 They're like, we exist outside of cannon out.
00:57:03 That's what the character say.
00:57:04 This is a real tangible concept.
00:57:06 We are outside cannon, which you can think of as the story of Homestuck.
00:57:10 That was a thing released on this website.
00:57:12 They are outside that now it's a, it's a joke.
00:57:14 It's like real to them, whatever.
00:57:16 They're talking about John needs to go back and go in there and several things are discussed.
00:57:22 One is that like the danger they face now is that their current existence faces the danger
00:57:27 of like, they say, I forget the exact words they use, but like fading from effectively
00:57:31 relevance, which I understand we talked about this to me and Gabe.
00:57:35 I get the idea that it's that, that the audience will stop caring and that we won't think
00:57:41 about them.
00:57:42 And so like they won't exist to us.
00:57:44 This is the meta point being made that like, oh no, if we don't make more Homestuck content,
00:57:50 we will be forgotten about.
00:57:51 We like extended universe.
00:57:52 I don't know whether that was, I don't know whether that was literally the point.
00:57:54 Oh, that was absolutely intentional.
00:57:55 No, no, no.
00:57:56 Yeah.
00:57:57 Well, that, that wasn't, I guess, an intentional, I don't, hmm, I'm not sure that was like the
00:58:03 message they were trying to get across with that.
00:58:05 I think it was just sort of like, in an epilogue, the idea that if these characters who are
00:58:11 in an epilogue, which is not part of the story, and, and John has retcom powers, and is like
00:58:18 shown to go in back into the comic after he completes it to do something, then like, what
00:58:25 would the character, why would he do that?
00:58:27 Why would the characters, like these characters who are no longer part of the comic, who are,
00:58:32 you know, effectively happy and fine, and nothing will, you know, bother them.
00:58:37 It was like an exploration of what if the characters in the epilogue knew that they were
00:58:41 not part of the story anymore, and I was just sort of like a thing.
00:58:44 I mean, that's exactly right.
00:58:45 But Hussie has chosen to make it a thing for these new characters that, I mean, we know
00:58:49 as readers that these are the same character.
00:58:51 This is canon in real life to us.
00:58:54 He has chosen to make it a problem for us by continuing the story that we, the audience,
00:59:00 will forget about them.
00:59:02 That is the problem they made into a tangible danger for the characters.
00:59:05 That's the way it was described.
00:59:06 It's definitely intentional.
00:59:07 I can't, I don't know how, like, you, okay.
00:59:11 Maybe I just didn't realize.
00:59:12 I mean, the solution to this problem, the solution to the danger is to not write this story.
00:59:19 That makes it not a danger.
00:59:20 And then in our minds, the characters just quote unquote live happily ever after in whatever
00:59:25 way anyone chooses to think about it.
00:59:27 He's choosing to make this an issue and he doesn't need to.
00:59:30 So cynically into that thing.
00:59:32 It's a really honestly interesting thing.
00:59:34 But it's true.
00:59:35 That's so clear.
00:59:36 No, no, no, no.
00:59:37 I'm saying we can take it like one step farther than that.
00:59:40 Okay.
00:59:41 Okay.
00:59:42 This, okay.
00:59:43 This could be like almost like, you can read into this a lot of things, one of which could
00:59:48 be like, it sort of factors into this media in a way where it's like Andrew, Buddy, people
00:59:55 are losing Homestuck.
00:59:56 They don't care about Homestuck anymore.
00:59:58 You don't see that many cosplayers at Anime Expo anymore.
01:00:03 They're losing relevance.
01:00:04 You got to bring them back.
01:00:05 You got to do the epilogue that you tease that one time in one sentence like two years
01:00:09 ago.
01:00:10 You got to do that.
01:00:11 It's been three years, by the way, since it ended.
01:00:13 Okay.
01:00:14 Three years.
01:00:15 So you could read like, you know, John's being forced into this scenario just sort of out
01:00:21 of the blue.
01:00:22 He doesn't like, he is not.
01:00:25 John's being forced to dance for his money like a painted up horse, draw it out across
01:00:29 our computer screens again.
01:00:30 Yeah.
01:00:31 You could read that maybe Hussie's doing something similar.
01:00:34 And John is, John like Hussie is so cucked of a character.
01:00:38 He is alone.
01:00:39 He is sad.
01:00:40 He's let his relationships dwindle in the 10 years since Homestuck ended.
01:00:45 It is, it's every nightmare I ever have about a character and the way to fix this is to
01:00:51 just not write the story and let me imagine the happy ever after.
01:00:56 That's the solution.
01:00:57 Okay.
01:00:58 But he's choosing not to.
01:00:59 I want to know what the like, the intention, like what is Hussie trying to convey?
01:01:04 Make more money, please, Viz Media.
01:01:07 Capitalize on the brand.
01:01:08 Hold on.
01:01:09 I just mean like, John was like this, he was like a weird sadistic, obviously not as pronounced
01:01:13 or like explicit, but he was like this in the, the Snapchat stuff.
01:01:18 He was like a weird loner that no one talked to.
01:01:21 And like, I just want to know because I'm genuinely interested, like, why?
01:01:26 This was never a thing about John before.
01:01:30 Why is he sad or depressed?
01:01:31 Maybe it represents Hussie's feelings about his own life.
01:01:33 I don't know.
01:01:34 I mean, there's no like contradiction with that because John didn't have like nearby
01:01:40 friends.
01:01:41 He only knew people online.
01:01:42 But he talked to them.
01:01:43 What do you mean?
01:01:44 He talked to them.
01:01:45 No, I know that.
01:01:46 I mean, ten years is a long time.
01:01:49 There's been parts of like John's like sort of like repressing of emotions.
01:01:55 Like he doesn't let himself feel a lot of things or like, he doesn't say things when
01:02:00 he feel, when he's thinking things like, the time where he sees his dad, dead, killed in
01:02:06 front of him and he barely even reacts at all.
01:02:09 He does talk about moping about how his dad's been dead in the ten years since the end.
01:02:14 Is it explicitly said that he represses it?
01:02:17 Because I believe there is dialogue that said that he just doesn't feel the way that other
01:02:21 people do.
01:02:22 I believe that was explicitly said.
01:02:23 Well, the thing is, kids say that they don't feel emotions, but they do.
01:02:28 I feel like that would have been, there was that time on the meteor when he like thought
01:02:34 the corner was shit and he sort of had a breakdown and went insane.
01:02:38 Yeah, yeah.
01:02:39 It's just like, he's a teenager and a lot of homestuck is about growing up.
01:02:43 And John is just sort of like things about things that he just didn't, didn't have like
01:02:48 the, the emotional capacity to, to react to properly, just sort of made him, I don't know.
01:02:55 Hey, but how about the section of the epilogue though, where John is, is understandably questioning
01:03:01 what exactly is the nature of the relationship between Roxy and the Calliope.
01:03:07 And I mean, I've been wondering that all along too.
01:03:09 And I mean, it clearly establishes John and Roxy, despite the obvious intention for them
01:03:13 to be an item, did not get together.
01:03:16 And you know, that's okay.
01:03:17 That doesn't violate anything.
01:03:18 It's just unsatisfying for me, but that can be intentional.
01:03:21 I mean, yeah, John, John is like a real fuck.
01:03:24 Like it is.
01:03:25 I don't feel like it's too, I mean, it's very sad.
01:03:28 It's very sad and like upsetting that John, our good blue boy has, has been like having
01:03:36 had this realistic, upsetting, unsatisfying, like growing ups period of his life.
01:03:41 I mean, he's a guy.
01:03:42 How much of his life has to be realistic?
01:03:44 Oh, okay.
01:03:46 It's weird that John and Roxy were even implied to be a thing and then not followed through.
01:03:52 John and Roxy did not have like an organic like, like romance blossom between them.
01:03:58 The first conversation, John talks to Roxy, there's immediately like the boy for material
01:04:03 joke.
01:04:04 They want to bone in their first month, does not develop whatsoever and then they are implied
01:04:10 to be a, they're implied to get closer and closer over their thing through the retcon.
01:04:15 And then it does not pan out for no reason.
01:04:18 It's not like they have a conversation where they decide they're not going to be together
01:04:21 or where Roxy decides that she will be with Cliope or not.
01:04:25 It just is built up out of nowhere and then dropped out of nowhere.
01:04:29 That's acknowledged.
01:04:30 And the only comment on it is like, John's like, yeah, that was a thing.
01:04:34 It's acknowledged that happened and it's really sad that it didn't work out for whatever
01:04:37 in canon reasons.
01:04:38 Well, hold on.
01:04:39 I think that's bullshit that you're just like, well, it didn't work out.
01:04:42 And then like, no reason given.
01:04:45 Like it's like, I think it is weird, I don't know.
01:04:48 I think what the reason for it is that why is it so fucking bad?
01:04:54 John, there's nothing, there was nothing fucked up about John.
01:04:57 Like he was fine.
01:04:58 Yeah.
01:04:59 I don't know.
01:05:00 Like what, what, what is this?
01:05:01 Well, he was fucked up after the time skip.
01:05:02 He was just kind of a weirdo.
01:05:03 Uh, I don't know.
01:05:05 John's always been a bit of a goober.
01:05:06 He's not been like the most normal person of all time.
01:05:09 A goober is not like an anti-social loner weirdo.
01:05:11 No, he's not.
01:05:12 He's never been like that ever.
01:05:14 I don't know why any of you are saying no.
01:05:16 What about, what about the fact that his friends only existed on the internet at the beginning
01:05:20 of Homestuck.
01:05:21 And he was perfectly sociable.
01:05:22 He was perfectly sociable.
01:05:23 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, for fuck's sake, John has been, he's not an outgoing
01:05:30 social dynamo.
01:05:32 He is very chill and relaxed and people come to him.
01:05:36 And I'm just saying, like Roxy is more of an outgoing person and John, John wouldn't
01:05:41 initiate things.
01:05:42 She would probably be waiting for him to, because she's a girl and that's what girls
01:05:45 do.
01:05:46 And he just didn't do it.
01:05:47 Like, I don't, I don't see, I don't see John being a loner as like, I don't see John
01:05:51 being a loner as completely out of character for John Egbert.
01:05:54 I mean, I agree.
01:05:55 I agree with that.
01:05:56 I think, I think it's something that can happen and probably happen to Hussie and that's
01:05:58 why he's written it like that.
01:05:59 I don't think that, like, like, like in theory, it makes absolutely no sense and is a betrayal
01:06:05 of John's character.
01:06:07 I feel like it came out of nowhere, it was not probably set up and goes against what
01:06:11 I perceived the character to be like, I think, pretty rational.
01:06:14 I mean, and it also, it also just sucks.
01:06:17 It also just sucks.
01:06:18 It also just sucks.
01:06:19 That's a perfectly reasonable point.
01:06:21 In Homestuck, yeah, you're right, John is not the most popular kid in school.
01:06:26 He's not a social dynamo.
01:06:28 That's not what I'm saying.
01:06:30 I'm saying that John was already, like, let's say that like, even the physical distance
01:06:35 was greater, like it was pre the game and he could not fly to people whenever he wanted
01:06:40 to.
01:06:42 He would still talk to people because that's what he did in Homestuck.
01:06:45 You're right.
01:06:46 He waited for his friends to initiate the conversations, all, but not like exclusively.
01:06:51 He talked to people, he responded and was completely agreeable.
01:06:55 I feel like this conversation is honestly pointless because we could speculate all day
01:06:59 about whether or not it was characterized correctly of John, that he would react this
01:07:03 way.
01:07:04 But the fact is he did and you can either like that or not, I just don't think, you
01:07:07 know, I don't know.
01:07:08 I have one nugget of info from the, the, the, the author notes of act five, act two that
01:07:13 I read.
01:07:14 Okay.
01:07:15 Um, where Hussie was talking about how the romance that, uh, was set up immediately
01:07:20 between Karkat and Terezi and how that didn't go anywhere.
01:07:24 And the reason he put, he said that he, uh, that it didn't go anywhere in the end was
01:07:30 because the fact that it was obvious from the start made it kind of less interesting.
01:07:34 And so he didn't want to follow through with it.
01:07:36 That sounds rather capricious as an author to just not follow through because things
01:07:40 are too obvious.
01:07:41 Well, well, I mean, he explained in why it being too obvious just wasn't very interesting
01:07:47 to him and he was like, you know, I mean, it works about the things he likes to write.
01:07:54 And I think certain realistic, like unsatisfying real life things, he likes to add into things
01:08:00 like this.
01:08:01 A lot of acts six is about, you know, whether you like it or not, he likes to make things
01:08:08 that just don't have payoffs in the way that you want, want them to like roses, like play
01:08:13 the rain sort of thing.
01:08:15 He deliberately threw that under the bus because people were expecting it and he's just kind
01:08:19 of an asshole.
01:08:20 I mean, I would make a distinction between satisfying character arcs and like adventure
01:08:25 potential threats that are not significantly built up that don't ultimately get finished.
01:08:30 Well, it's just, it's just a quirk about Hussie as a writer is what it was just a quirk that
01:08:34 he intentionally writes bad, badly.
01:08:36 No, it's not that he does.
01:08:38 Well, I mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not defending it.
01:08:42 I'm just explaining that this is why this thing with John is probably happening in this
01:08:46 way.
01:08:47 People like to build up.
01:08:48 To make John have like a realistically upsetting, unsatisfying real life.
01:08:51 But hang on, that word realistic, I feel that you might be using to say that reflects more
01:08:57 accurately your depiction of how life might go for him versus like if he just like got
01:09:01 the girl.
01:09:02 No, I don't mean that.
01:09:03 I don't mean that.
01:09:04 I mean, like in real life, character arcs don't necessarily complete and happy endings
01:09:10 don't necessarily happen.
01:09:12 You know, the road, the girl doesn't necessarily get the, the guy doesn't necessarily get the
01:09:16 girl at the end.
01:09:17 You know, it's just like, um, you know, real life is not like a fiction and Hussie likes
01:09:23 to put that in fiction.
01:09:24 Yeah, man.
01:09:25 We're not, we don't have arcs.
01:09:26 We're people.
01:09:27 We're not characters.
01:09:28 Yeah.
01:09:29 That, that, that literally that right there is like a very obvious, you know, I don't know
01:09:34 what I don't really like it, but that's just how I understand Hussie.
01:09:39 I mean, I'm absolutely in the camp of it totally sucks that John and Roxie didn't get together.
01:09:43 So that, I mean, that's just ultimately, it just sucks.
01:09:45 That's all.
01:09:46 Well, but why?
01:09:48 I don't think they necessarily had that much chemistry together.
01:09:50 And again, I think it came out of nowhere.
01:09:53 But what they just met, they met for the first time.
01:09:55 Why?
01:09:56 I know why do they instantly want to have, okay, I guess they didn't even, they just
01:10:00 worked together.
01:10:01 It's, it's not even weird.
01:10:02 Well, like, what's the point of that whole, like part of the story then, like the whole
01:10:07 thing is that like John and Roxie are having like this, this, this romance or whatever building
01:10:13 up during the thing.
01:10:15 And like to have that come to nothing, it's like, well, why did I even fucking bother reading
01:10:18 it?
01:10:19 Why don't we just skip to the end?
01:10:20 Hussie, does Hussie plan out every little thing about like how a character, you know,
01:10:23 the relationship will progress?
01:10:24 He used to.
01:10:25 Yeah.
01:10:26 I mean, things kind of spiralized.
01:10:27 It's funny.
01:10:28 It's funny because it was satisfying when he didn't plan things.
01:10:30 And then by act six, he probably was planning out everything.
01:10:34 And so like act five, act five.
01:10:37 I mean, frankly, I think to say that he planned out everything and then have this Roxy thing
01:10:41 aside from some world building things he had in mind, like a lot of act five or the troll
01:10:45 like, you know, he didn't have it all mapped out in his head and it was really, really
01:10:50 funny.
01:10:51 And it was really good.
01:10:52 What's striking about this Homestuck epilogue is how played straight it is.
01:10:58 It just is like, okay, two things.
01:11:02 First of all, there are jokes, quote unquote.
01:11:05 And I said this in a text chat with Hippo where, but they operate at such a low like
01:11:10 frequency and such like a low, like, like they were like three, I could just even think
01:11:17 of and they were so, I don't know what the word is, but just like non-infectual whatsoever.
01:11:23 It was a depressing thing.
01:11:24 So I could be like, like a, um, like a Twitter joke on your timeline or she's like, you know,
01:11:30 I guess it's a joke, you know, I read your story as it's intended to provoke humor and
01:11:34 then you scroll past it immediately.
01:11:36 It definitely feels like a dilution of hussy humor with a fanfic Homestuck author put in
01:11:46 there and someone else like it definitely feels like a three person thing.
01:11:50 Um, I, if I was being extremely generous, which generally I didn't, you know, I like
01:11:56 to be generous, but I don't actually think this is the case in this, but this is an idea
01:12:00 I had is that, um, the fact of it being a fanfiction, uh, is part of the reason why
01:12:07 it sort of isn't that funny, uh, like Homestuck because fanfiction writers often don't stick
01:12:15 with the tone of the original work.
01:12:17 Like if they take like a happy thing, they write a gore fanfic, like everyone's dead,
01:12:22 like cupcakes.
01:12:23 Yeah.
01:12:24 Stuff like that.
01:12:25 They go completely off the wall, crazy or super dramatic and it's like not in line with
01:12:30 the way the characters are and it's, you know, just because a lot of fanfics are written
01:12:34 by teenagers who are just, um, moody and depressed and horny and that's all they're thinking
01:12:39 about.
01:12:40 So they just take the characters that they like and make them do things that they wouldn't
01:12:41 otherwise do.
01:12:42 When you're dealing with a, if I'm being extremely generous, fanfiction, you're saying that fanfiction,
01:12:47 you're saying that fanfiction writers don't think that it'd be like it is, and this,
01:12:54 this, this thing that's happening in this fanfiction is like, um, you know, roses on
01:13:01 drugs and like having visions and John has like a choice to make and his emotional, his
01:13:08 relationships have all fucked off and he's really depressed and he maybe will go somewhere
01:13:15 and never come back and never see his friends again and it's all like kind of depressing
01:13:18 and dramatic, which is like a fanfiction would be, but I don't know whether that was deliberate
01:13:23 or not.
01:13:24 Okay. I haven't read it. I'm just going off of what you guys are saying. Is this a cry
01:13:27 for help from Hussie?
01:13:28 I don't think so.
01:13:29 It's hard to tell, but I don't think so.
01:13:33 Yeah. I mean, I'd say that's unlikely, but maybe. I mean, who knows? Uh, maybe all the
01:13:38 homesick.
01:13:39 I mean, Hussie's probably been crying for help ever since, uh, in his life.
01:13:44 Yeah. Ever since, uh, the, what is it, the odd hat man?
01:13:47 The odd gentleman.
01:13:48 The odd gentleman.
01:13:49 Yeah.
01:13:50 Ever since then.
01:13:51 Shout out to, shout out to Hiveswap Quest by Shaddock.
01:13:55 Yes. Quite good. I'm going to go link that and chat right now. Hold on.
01:13:58 Okay. Good. Hey, it details the, the tremendous, um, fuckery that is the, the release of Hiveswap
01:14:05 act one and the fact that it's completely delayed and everything sucks, but it's, it's
01:14:09 funny. It's a funny little animation.
01:14:11 Poor Hussie.
01:14:12 Uh, hey.
01:14:13 Shout out to the odd gentlemen for their great work on King's Quest five spectacular as known
01:14:20 on a steam train, Game Grumps.
01:14:23 Oh yeah.
01:14:24 Um, I did want to just shit on this epilogue in one other way, uh, which we a little bit
01:14:29 got passed or, I don't know, maybe people were trying to excuse a little bit, which
01:14:32 was just that like there is specific mention made of how, uh, like one of the things that
01:14:39 John needs to do is go back to like what's described in Canon, I think by Rose or maybe
01:14:44 Calliope, I can't remember. It's like they need to like, quote, fill in the gaps like
01:14:50 in Canon.
01:14:51 So we're just literally talking about like answering questions that were not addressed
01:14:56 like that. And I know like, yes, doesn't like ruin or fix home stuck to do this. I could
01:15:01 put that aside. It's just that like, this just reminds me of, oh, it sure sucked that
01:15:05 like the whole way that Lord English was defeated, I barely understood it all. And now we're
01:15:10 going to go answer that question, I guess.
01:15:13 Uh, cool.
01:15:14 Just in time.
01:15:15 Why totally still can't word English and homestuck, like fucking Ultima.
01:15:21 Yeah. Oh yeah.
01:15:22 Just like, just like Ultima.
01:15:24 Yep. Yeah.
01:15:25 Maybe it's it's deliberate.
01:15:26 I don't understand.
01:15:28 I've been sitting here for the last like 45 minutes.
01:15:30 Yeah.
01:15:31 Yeah.
01:15:32 I wouldn't expect anything less.
01:15:35 Um, so I just want to say that like sure is embarrassing that home stuck didn't like
01:15:40 write itself well the first time and now needs to go back and like fix things in
01:15:44 actually even worse if this is what is to be the standard.
01:15:48 Yeah.
01:15:49 Like, so this, this is what I'm supposed to call genius of 4D writing to just like
01:15:53 not make it satisfying the first time and go back years later after it's done and try
01:15:57 to fix it.
01:15:58 I would never like, I like to understand why things are the way they are. I don't like
01:16:04 defend anything that I've been explaining. I don't think Hussie is a genius for writing
01:16:10 some ways.
01:16:11 I would say he is. It's just that he's made mistakes.
01:16:13 Hippo said he doesn't think this is a genius move.
01:16:16 Okay.
01:16:17 Okay.
01:16:18 I think is in the chess game.
01:16:19 I mean, the past is the past. He can't like fix home stuck even though he tried to with
01:16:23 John's retcon powers, which sucked and I hate, um, and he changed the whole website.
01:16:27 I think that was a change like tried to fix home stuck. I think it was just like a narrative.
01:16:32 Well, you're right. He didn't try to fix home stuck. He in fact fucked up home stuck by
01:16:36 changing old panels with his epic 4D retcon panels thing, which I don't even dislike. What
01:16:42 I just don't like is that the experience of reading the comic will never be replicated
01:16:46 again because it's been changed due to narrative things later.
01:16:50 And now the books are printing with those retcons in.
01:16:54 I think that's fine. Like that with the hand, the hands, that doesn't, that doesn't take
01:17:00 anything away.
01:17:01 The armors are your hand.
01:17:02 I'm totally okay with the arm retrieval.
01:17:04 Well, okay. The one thing that it takes away is the, the, the change that you would experience
01:17:10 if you were a current reader reading along, I'm going to argue against that. I actually
01:17:14 think it's better to print with it because now you probably won't notice them on your
01:17:19 first pass through.
01:17:20 Or even if you do, you will just, you probably will just like dismiss it and not know what
01:17:24 it is.
01:17:25 You might be right about that.
01:17:26 And then when you get to that part and you're like, wait a minute, and you might flip back
01:17:30 in the book and be like, whoa, it was there all along.
01:17:32 I didn't even know.
01:17:33 I agree.
01:17:34 I'll agree.
01:17:35 The story is probably better for that. And I don't mind it. But the thing I do mind about
01:17:40 that is I don't like the potential credit that Hussie will receive for people thinking
01:17:46 that he thought about that ahead of time when he did not and does not deserve to, you know,
01:17:52 be rewarded.
01:17:53 All right.
01:17:54 That's my issue.
01:17:55 You put a lot of,
01:17:56 That's dumb.
01:17:57 If you're writing a narrative,
01:17:58 Because it wasn't in the comic.
01:17:59 That's how you think ahead of time.
01:18:03 People lack like it.
01:18:04 Jesse, this is this is one of the things that we know anything like it's never happened
01:18:08 before.
01:18:09 No, because Jesse, we read the comic and the comic itself changed as part of the Lord.
01:18:18 He could have planned to not write it in the panels ahead of time.
01:18:21 Nate, you have, I don't know whether this is like smart or not, because I just generally
01:18:27 don't agree with it. But like you put a lot of like emphasis or like cloud on somebody
01:18:35 planning something ahead of time or not. Like if you can't prove that you planned it ahead
01:18:40 of time, then, you know, they don't, they're not allowed to get like credit or like artist
01:18:46 credit.
01:18:47 What can I say?
01:18:48 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
01:18:49 I just I just generally don't think that that really matters because it's like how much
01:18:54 you care about like how much how many good boy points you give to the author.
01:19:01 I don't know.
01:19:02 I don't know.
01:19:03 There's a kind of social currency and narrative intelligence currency that people care.
01:19:07 Well, Nate, if he had written the whole book on his own without putting it online, right?
01:19:13 If he'd just written Homestuck by himself and then released it all at once, then he could
01:19:18 have like thought of the arm thing later on as he was writing and gone back and added
01:19:22 it in.
01:19:24 And it would be normal. So like why is it not fine for him to think of something to
01:19:30 add to the comic later on and go back, add it in and then print it as though it was there
01:19:35 all because like that's just what writing a book is like.
01:19:37 I mean, you don't have to, you don't have to think of everything in order.
01:19:40 I mean, that's totally fair. But for one, it's simply the fact that like any number
01:19:45 of things or people or ideas could have influenced his process since it was released piece by
01:19:49 piece as it went through. So, you know, and I'm aware of this like boiled down to like
01:19:54 how much money the person deserves to make.
01:19:57 No, it's actually not about money at all. It's about it's about like social cred or
01:20:00 intellectual cred. That's that's a personal thing.
01:20:04 I care immensely.
01:20:05 I understand that you care immensely about it, but like you bring it up in arguments
01:20:09 with other people who may not have, who may not give a shit about like that amount of
01:20:15 maybe the audience level.
01:20:16 It's like, it's like, it's like, well, wait, hold on, we got to make absolutely sure not
01:20:21 to let this author get more credit for this thing.
01:20:24 Like we got like, we can call this thing good, but we got to qualify that like this was good
01:20:28 by accident.
01:20:29 So we shouldn't we shouldn't give the author credit for it.
01:20:32 Yeah, yeah.
01:20:32 No, God, stop. Don't be with me. What are you talking about?
01:20:36 It's not like it's not it shouldn't be regarded as even impressive to foreshadow, which should
01:20:41 just be a given. And if you can't do it and you have to retroactively put foreshadowing
01:20:45 in that wasn't there before, then you failed as a writer and you shouldn't be praised.
01:20:51 That's so stupid.
01:20:54 You know what? I don't know.
01:20:56 There's like, when you're when you're writing a book, like the web comic format, the format
01:21:02 that Homestuck came out and did not allow for that, people write big ass novels, they
01:21:05 spend a year and they still don't just shut up, shut up, they spend years writing a novel.
01:21:09 They have all that time to go back and rework and re-edit youth like people don't just people
01:21:14 it's like you're expecting him to get it right on the first try. Nothing's ever right on
01:21:18 the first try.
01:21:19 Movies go through drafts movies go movies go through fucking a thousand drafts before
01:21:23 they release novels get rewritten and rewritten and rewritten and like it's fine.
01:21:27 I get it.
01:21:28 I don't think you do get it because if you did get it, you wouldn't you wouldn't think
01:21:32 this weird thing that you think it doesn't make any fucking sense for some reason, Ben.
01:21:36 You are equivocating between two very different mediums and assuming that the like everything
01:21:40 that's involved in one needs to be applied to the other when they're completely different
01:21:45 and not.
01:21:46 Isn't that what you're doing?
01:21:47 Why would you judge them differently?
01:21:49 Because they're different mediums. Why don't you judge a painting and a song the same?
01:21:52 They're basically the same thing, right?
01:21:54 Because it's an internet thing that came out weekly and he didn't have as much time to
01:21:57 maybe edit it for years and years each time that he couldn't have properly foreshadowed
01:22:03 the first time because it was coming out weekly.
01:22:06 Right.
01:22:07 Listen, listen.
01:22:08 The nature of this foreshadowing thing.
01:22:09 The hippo let me fucking talk.
01:22:11 If that were a requirement, then if that were a requirement, then what you'd be saying is
01:22:17 it's not okay that he decided on something later to go back and add in because it's like
01:22:24 what?
01:22:25 Because like he didn't think of it soon enough and like once and once and once and once you
01:22:29 and once.
01:22:30 I think it would be impressive if he had.
01:22:33 Okay, okay.
01:22:34 Well, I'll agree that it's not as impressive that he didn't have it all planned out for
01:22:37 the start.
01:22:38 I think he was agreeing.
01:22:39 I did it.
01:22:44 I mean, yeah, you did it with some of the aspects of the horseshoe stuff.
01:22:49 I'm better than Hussie is my point.
01:22:51 That's the whole thing I was getting at this whole time.
01:22:54 I figured.
01:22:55 I figured as much.
01:22:57 But okay, just to put a final point at it, the reason why it actually ties back to Digi
01:23:02 and Destiny's debate they had the other day, which is like imagine you've got two Manga,
01:23:12 I'm thinking of Manga right now for whatever reason, but like you've got two Manga because
01:23:15 like Oda supposedly will find out when one piece is done.
01:23:18 I don't take this on faith, but he says he had the ending planned all along and when
01:23:22 it comes out, we'll see if it's good or not.
01:23:23 And we'll be able to judge it until then.
01:23:25 I remain agnostic as to how good it was.
01:23:28 Whereas like let's say like something like Naruto, the way Naruto ended was clearly
01:23:32 not the way things like were intended all along.
01:23:34 A lot of stuff was kind of made up as a way like the importance of Sasuke was conflated
01:23:38 to be like the rival of Naruto.
01:23:39 That became the focus and like what we can learn from this, I think and again, we'll
01:23:43 judge Oda after it's all done is like what we can expect from the quality of the writing
01:23:48 of the person when they write their next thing.
01:23:51 It's how impressive do we expect it to be or like someone who's a game developer who
01:23:56 makes a game that's like broken, but then when they make DLC, oh, like that fixes it.
01:24:01 Well, okay, great.
01:24:02 But now when you make your new project and maybe that doesn't have DLC, we can possibly
01:24:05 expect it to have some holes or not be fucked up or that stuff.
01:24:10 I think this like leads into like just managing hype, right?
01:24:15 So like George Lucas, he made Star Wars, but like a lot of the good decisions weren't
01:24:24 entirely his.
01:24:25 So when he had complete creative control, people thought because George Lucas made Star
01:24:29 Wars that the prequels would be really good, they weren't because Georgia is like kind
01:24:34 of not that good at writing as it turns out.
01:24:39 So like what you would like is for people to be more skeptical about giving certain
01:24:44 creatives very much high amounts of praise when they may not actually deserve the praise
01:24:50 so as to mitigate hype in the future so that people don't get burned.
01:24:55 More or less.
01:24:56 Yes, it's about managing consumer choices in terms of what you want to invest your money
01:25:00 and expectations for personal enjoyment.
01:25:02 Okay, I mean, a lot of the time where I don't agree with you on things like that, it's really
01:25:06 just because whether or not they deserve the credit, they're basically the same level
01:25:11 of artist.
01:25:12 I don't think Oda will be a complete hack if something about one piece is not good when
01:25:20 so much of it is brilliant.
01:25:22 Well, sure, but that's not really what I mean.
01:25:24 I mean, maybe it is in the sense that you're talking about things that aren't planned,
01:25:27 like hockey.
01:25:28 All the time hockey was not planned and there are some like some holes that I feel hockey
01:25:32 creates a minor issue.
01:25:33 The sport hockey?
01:25:34 Sorry?
01:25:35 What?
01:25:36 No, I'm not the sport.
01:25:37 Conquerors hockey.
01:25:38 Well, hockey.
01:25:39 H-A-K-I.
01:25:40 So it's an anime thing.
01:25:41 It's an anime thing.
01:25:42 Okay, well, you know what?
01:25:43 I think the people have heard enough on this.
01:25:45 I think they get our sides.
01:25:46 Well, there was one point that I wanted to say before we move on about it.
01:25:49 I just want to say that this entire thing seems like the bane of my existence and this
01:25:53 is metanarrative at any cost.
01:25:56 We will do anything as long as it's metanarrative.
01:25:59 You're talking about Homestuck.
01:26:00 Yeah, I'm talking about Homestuck right now.
01:26:01 Okay.
01:26:02 The Homestuck epilogue.
01:26:03 Sacrifice everything for the sake of a meta, whatever it takes.
01:26:06 Yeah.
01:26:07 Homestuck in the beginning was not like, okay, it was meta in a few ways, but like it's not,
01:26:11 its goal was not to be as like meta as humanly possible, which is what everyone latched onto
01:26:19 by the end.
01:26:20 Just like the only reason to read Homestuck is that it was so fucking crazy, it plays
01:26:23 with narrative structures.
01:26:24 I mean, just to put one point on there.
01:26:26 I would argue that Homestuck has done the best job of thoroughly exploring the fictional,
01:26:31 not meta, real concept of time travel.
01:26:35 It has done a far better job than any other story I've ever read and like that's not
01:26:40 a meta concept.
01:26:41 That's just great storytelling and it was sick and dope.
01:26:44 Agreed.
01:26:45 Salute that.
01:26:46 Salute that.
01:26:47 Like I would say like meta can like can enhance a story, obviously.
01:26:53 I'm not saying that being meta is bad, but I'm saying that it was just used sparingly
01:26:59 in the beginning and then ballooned into a larger portion of what the story was about
01:27:04 than I wanted.
01:27:06 And now it feels like it's consumed like this entire thing is just one Rose and John text
01:27:11 up about, you know, philosophical, philosophical quandaries, you know, are we canon, we're
01:27:16 forgetting, we're fading, da, da, da, da, da.
01:27:18 Whereas I would like to have just heard some of the funny rich dialogue that was in the
01:27:22 beginning.
01:27:23 I just miss that.
01:27:24 I don't like that.
01:27:25 Seemingly, the Husseys just now played into the fact that Homestuck is a meta thing and
01:27:31 that's all that we must pay attention to.
01:27:33 Yeah, it's like it started off as a comic about four kids stuck in their homes and their
01:27:41 quest that is like metaphorically about growing up and then meta stuff also was there and
01:27:46 now it's completely shifted that's mostly meta stuff and there is no character back
01:27:50 and forth at all.
01:27:51 I mean, I think that because Husseys talked about many times about or like we've speculated
01:27:55 on arm retrieval famously and elsewhere that like, Husseys doesn't care anymore.
01:27:59 Like the thing he does care about is I think Husseys is interested in telling meta stories.
01:28:03 I don't think he's particularly interested in these characters and, you know, their stories
01:28:07 are done.
01:28:08 And so I like maybe he really has been or like encouraged heavily by his media to go
01:28:13 back and like make more and he's turning it into a meta thing that he does find interesting
01:28:17 with this whole fading from relevance, you know, plot line.
01:28:21 I don't know.
01:28:22 And that's not even uninteresting.
01:28:23 But I think as much as saying when you intentionally or not, because you want to or not, when you
01:28:29 sacrifice the things that guys like me and Munchy and Gib and Ben and everybody fell
01:28:33 in love with, which is like the witty snarkiness to like for the sake of getting more meta
01:28:38 stuff out of there, I just think it's natural to lose some excitement and some of your fans
01:28:43 in that process.
01:28:45 So yeah, that's where I'm at.
01:28:46 I also want to say that no one agrees with me.
01:28:50 No one, no one, no one in this call.
01:28:52 No one agrees with me in the world that the homesick art was good and then it became bad
01:28:59 and that's a problem.
01:29:00 Everyone's like, oh, fucking, you know, whatever.
01:29:02 No one even read.
01:29:03 No one even looked at the drawings anyway.
01:29:05 Do you?
01:29:05 Well, thank fucking God.
01:29:07 So I don't I don't I don't shit on me.
01:29:12 I think, you know, you tried to point out some like sloppy panels in like the later acts
01:29:17 and like, yeah, they're there.
01:29:19 But like, there were always some sloppy panels.
01:29:22 It's not like there were some bad in axis.
01:29:25 It means the overwhelming majority of them were terrible, especially towards the end.
01:29:30 I assume you mean aesthetically, right?
01:29:32 Yeah, I mean, in terms of like skill.
01:29:34 Yeah. OK.
01:29:35 Aesthetically, I think we can that that could be a serious and skill and as well.
01:29:39 And with that, you might see some pushback on.
01:29:41 Yeah, I don't know.
01:29:42 I don't I don't I mean, I don't know.
01:29:46 There's always had it's always had its wonky art.
01:29:50 Homesick always had its wonky art moments.
01:29:53 No, it wasn't.
01:29:54 It wasn't wonky.
01:29:55 It was just like unkempt and rushed and sort of like slapdash.
01:29:58 Like he drew a really good drawing, but he left in like little mistakes.
01:30:01 Like when he raised things, he would leave like little like stray pixels around.
01:30:07 And that was just like part of the look.
01:30:09 There later, everything's like actually a little cleaner.
01:30:13 But it's just like the the the the the structure of like like the poses
01:30:17 and the gifts and like the layout.
01:30:20 So just boring and uninteresting to look at.
01:30:22 Exactly. Overall.
01:30:24 There is no shortage of iconic panels from mid homestuck.
01:30:30 That is of course.
01:30:31 Yeah, of course, there are. Of course, there are.
01:30:33 But the the completely.
01:30:36 That's a fair point, Munchy, but you know, let's leave it there.
01:30:42 I think the people can can judge that one.
01:30:43 And OK, I don't know if we get anywhere.
01:30:45 I mean, I mean, I don't know.
01:30:47 Munchy, I'm going to say I think that maybe if there's fewer iconic visuals,
01:30:52 if there's fewer iconic moments in X6, it's probably just because the story
01:30:55 sucks and not because the art like took a huge downhill.
01:31:00 It took a downhill.
01:31:01 Maybe not the hugest that we're exaggerating it.
01:31:04 Not as huge as the writing.
01:31:05 Well, sure. Yeah, definitely, but it's 100 percent palpable.
01:31:08 Definitely, Palpatine, speaking of which,
01:31:10 Star Wars, Episode nine is coming.
01:31:12 Well, I can't wait.
01:31:13 Well, no, no.
01:31:16 Oh, yes, Episode nine is the most disappointing thing.
01:31:21 I was just saying my car here.
01:31:24 It's me, obviously.
01:31:27 But I'll tell you an opinion.
01:31:29 I'll give you a fucking spicy opinion right here.
01:31:31 Please. I just I want it to be over.
01:31:34 I don't like Star Wars, and I hate it.
01:31:35 And that's it.
01:31:37 It's not that. I think that's so spicy.
01:31:39 I'm here.
01:31:40 I don't know how spicy it is.
01:31:41 No, you're right.
01:31:42 It's not.
01:31:43 I didn't see solo.
01:31:45 I haven't seen anyone else.
01:31:47 I just like like when I saw it when I woke up and I saw that there was
01:31:51 a new Star Wars trailer, I just felt angry.
01:31:53 Just like, yeah, no, not again, no more.
01:31:57 I mean, you knew it was coming.
01:31:59 I knew it was coming.
01:32:00 But like, I wasn't ready.
01:32:01 I wasn't ready for the discourse.
01:32:02 That's what I was not ready.
01:32:04 It's not it's not it's not even the movies themselves that bothers me.
01:32:07 It's that I know there's going to be a new wave of Star Wars discourse,
01:32:11 and I'm not fucking ready.
01:32:12 That's true. That is true.
01:32:14 I can't I can't wait for the hundreds upon thousands of thumbnails of
01:32:17 reviews. Yeah.
01:32:18 Hey, hey, just a question.
01:32:20 Whether the media did not make a last Jedi review, right?
01:32:23 The last one, the last they did.
01:32:25 They did.
01:32:26 It was OK.
01:32:27 Wait, wait, they made a flinket of that.
01:32:29 Played. Yeah, Mr. Plinkett did a completely
01:32:33 straightforward review of the last Jedi.
01:32:35 And it was weird that it was not at all.
01:32:38 Yeah, it was not like it was not because like the old Plinkett's when they first
01:32:43 came out, they had a purpose because nobody had gone that in depth before
01:32:46 about these Star Wars prequels.
01:32:48 Like now it's just another fucking YouTube video.
01:32:52 It's this video, the YouTube algorithm.
01:32:55 It was called the last Plinkett review because at the end,
01:32:57 I think he goes on about like how there's no reason I did this because
01:33:01 everyone else has done it.
01:33:02 Oh, but I did it anywhere.
01:33:03 Oh, that's a that's a rough.
01:33:06 He said he suggests he says something about a boycott, but it's like it's
01:33:11 obviously not because clearly he's been swallowed by the YouTube algorithm
01:33:14 and he's going to really make another one.
01:33:16 I mean, I don't mind having the bags on on the Star Wars because I like
01:33:19 it just feels different.
01:33:20 It's appropriate. Plinkett should be.
01:33:22 Videos, not stars.
01:33:24 That's honestly the thing about boycotting.
01:33:27 I mean, fucking what's his face?
01:33:28 James Rolfe with this is what is it?
01:33:30 Like he's Ghostbusters, boycott, little carnivores.
01:33:32 That's fine.
01:33:32 But boycott, the real big boy thing to do is indeed boycott like any social
01:33:38 media discussion or interaction with the thing that you're boycotting.
01:33:41 And you can't like hashtag stay away from the Jedi or because all you're
01:33:46 doing is drumming more attention.
01:33:48 It's almost at political levels.
01:33:50 Like I hate Star Wars talk almost as much as I hate hearing people talk about
01:33:53 politics.
01:33:54 It's that saturated that it's getting to that point in my brain.
01:33:57 We're like, I hear it and I just want to know what the weird thing is, dude,
01:34:00 even Democrats and Republicans like red lights, say, but blue lights.
01:34:04 Wow, you got it, dude.
01:34:06 The thing about Star Wars is, and this is the thing that really pisses
01:34:10 me off about it, it feels like there's the most rage and anger about it.
01:34:15 And the most like waste of everyone's in the time world for the least
01:34:20 amount of content that has been generated.
01:34:23 It's like one movie, like at least with Marvel, there's like a movie
01:34:27 every six months or whatever.
01:34:28 So like, I get it why that keeps coming up.
01:34:30 But Star Wars is so, there's so little substance in Star Wars.
01:34:35 It's every one episode of Star Trek has more intellectual content than
01:34:41 any individual Star Wars movie.
01:34:43 There's like, there's like, there's like, there's like, there's like, there's
01:34:47 got to be 12 Star Wars movies at least.
01:34:50 And there's like two good ones.
01:34:52 Two of them are good, only two.
01:34:55 That sounds about right.
01:34:56 Episode one, Phantom Menace, episode three.
01:35:00 No, I mean, episode two is the best memes, sand, it's coarse and gay.
01:35:04 I like Empire and I like Revenge of the Sith, and that's it.
01:35:07 That's, you don't even like a new hope.
01:35:08 You don't like episode four or whatever.
01:35:10 A new hope is boring as fuck.
01:35:11 That is a boring fucking movie.
01:35:13 What?
01:35:14 No, there's a spicy take.
01:35:15 That is a spicy take.
01:35:16 That's the take we were looking for.
01:35:18 Yeah, I'm surprised.
01:35:18 A boomer such as yourself would.
01:35:21 Star Wars is the most boomer shit.
01:35:23 It's the most boomer core shit in the world.
01:35:25 Everyone even talking about Star Wars is a boomer.
01:35:27 Wait, wait, there's two things.
01:35:30 I can think of two things more boomer and that is Gremlins and Back to the Future.
01:35:35 I guess that's fair.
01:35:36 I guess they're a little more, more boomer than Star Wars.
01:35:39 Nate, you mentioned Star Trek.
01:35:41 Yeah, let's let's diverge immediately away from Star Wars.
01:35:44 Talk about Star Trek a bit.
01:35:45 I saw a clip on YouTube of Data and Klingon Man, a dwarf, whatever his name is, Wharf.
01:35:56 I don't know anything about Star Trek,
01:35:57 but it was a scene in which Wharf sort of dismissed like Data is acting captain
01:36:04 and Wharf like was first mate and he sort of dismissed him in front of the crew
01:36:10 and Data pulled him into another room to explain to him how you're not
01:36:13 supposed to do that as acting as his first mate and you know it was like Data is a robot
01:36:20 and you know he said it in a very robotic way but it was sort of you know just
01:36:24 explaining what his role is and then Wharf like oh I'm sorry captain like he just took
01:36:30 took the criticism like a man like an alien man and then they parted on good terms even though
01:36:38 it was just like really interesting a clip and then in the comments everyone was like
01:36:43 I ah I remember this scene I learned so much about honor from you and you know if it was
01:36:48 spooty old Star Wars then that conversation would go with Wharf being like I'm falling
01:36:53 to the dark side I'm gonna become evil the rage is building inside me one of the things one of
01:37:00 the things I love about Star Trek so much and at least of the two of the three seasons I've seen
01:37:06 of the original of next generation and I mean I've seen some of Voyager not counting that
01:37:10 but uh fucking Deep Space Nine is the insane actually this is a little bit less in Deep Space
01:37:15 Nine because that takes place during like a war but especially in the next generation the consummate
01:37:20 professionalism of every member of the crew they know their duty they do their job they are these
01:37:26 are military scientist people they are there they do not defy orders unless there's some like really
01:37:32 good reason to do it it's not about being like a rogue it's about being a member of a fucking team
01:37:37 and it feels like there's something so refreshing to just be like ah like there can be order there
01:37:44 can be like a social cohesion between people and people can just be nice and do good things to each
01:37:50 other and like fulfill their responsibilities watch the next generation and just feel the
01:37:54 historic feeling that society is worth fighting for and it can feel so good sometimes that's always
01:38:00 been the point of Star Trek especially TNG it was like showing humanity in the best way and being
01:38:05 like look look what can happen if we aspire to greatness and like commit to it exactly and that
01:38:10 moment you said right there like that literally could be a moment I'm just saying like data was
01:38:14 acting captain against Klingon Klingon alien uh uh androids with data is technically two different
01:38:19 species uh like this could be like a like a racist moment I guess it'd be a speciesist moment or
01:38:25 whatever and like sure you could go to HR or whatever and you could like complain to someone
01:38:30 but instead of doing that he takes them aside they just discuss this as professionals
01:38:35 wharf has a bias as many people do in the next generation against data but the thing is for
01:38:40 people who don't know so a lot of people know about Star Trek and and data and there's an
01:38:45 android just so people know data was not constructed by anyone to be a star fleet officer data was
01:38:52 constructed as an android with free will who independently just lived his life and decided
01:38:59 yeah is he is he x is he just x basically he's basically x he just like is the maverick hunters
01:39:04 and then uh were founded and then x decided to join them because he wanted to do that data just
01:39:08 decided the best thing he could do with his life to fulfill his own personal goals was to go through
01:39:14 the the academy the star fleet academy as every other student did he was just a student work hard
01:39:20 and earn his commission as an officer and then he became a second officer on the flagship through
01:39:26 his pure merit through no like being like built for the purpose he just decided to it has inherent
01:39:31 gifts and that's and that's why when he talks to wharf in that scene and wharf says like hey
01:39:36 fuck you man i'm not gonna work some fucking machine data says you don't understand wharf
01:39:39 i earned this position i am the captain we have a machine there's an order exactly well i'm paraphrasing
01:39:45 uh he asserts that he's the captain and that war like they need to abide by the roles of this like
01:39:51 military order of star fleet in order to make sure that everything runs efficiently
01:39:55 and if this is going to be a problem like i think he says like let me know like i'll have you step
01:39:59 down and i'll put someone else you know in first officer positioner i think that was implied at
01:40:03 least so i'm just saying uh so it's the best so it's the best well you know uh uh basically it's
01:40:10 that scene in uh game of thrones when uh janice slent when uh uh john john snow gets elected lord
01:40:17 commander of the night's watch and janice slents like fuck you and john is like i'm commander and if
01:40:23 you know it's the death sentence to fucking defy the lord commander and janice is like yeah well
01:40:27 fuck you anyway he's like well i'm gonna i'm gonna behead you then and then he does that it's basically
01:40:32 like that only i think this is so it's pretty much i think they've outlawed the death penalty in
01:40:36 star trek little known i will maybe people know this uh people who are criminals are treated as
01:40:41 mental health cases and are like treated to like fix their broken brains and uh that's what they do
01:40:47 my favorite thing about uh star trek yeah i really should watch it i didn't know that i did not know
01:40:51 that about star flea it's true and i there's just so you know there's a couple cases of people who
01:40:56 brains they can't fix and like those people are the ones they keep in jail but it's very very rare
01:41:00 those kind of people but yeah sure my my favorite thing about star trek uh every time i see uh you
01:41:07 know a clip of like the bridge and them just walking around you won't believe how much you love
01:41:11 star trek when you watch it i'm just saying but anyway well it's it's the fucking carpet it's the
01:41:16 fucking carpet and the lighting and it feels so it feels like a really nice comfy like friends house
01:41:22 bridge enterprise is home i want to live there every day yeah it's got it's so it's so it's so
01:41:29 nice to see like the ideal like the idea of like a spaceship but built to be furnished so that people
01:41:36 are relaxed and calm and it's nice yeah oh and which will hold up more sense than than just like uh
01:41:42 we're in space so you know dude really really cold blue lighting and stuff the thing about that is
01:41:48 you know that very ship like when they make star trek movies they they redo the lighting to make
01:41:52 everything look like professional and like movie-esque and fancy they just completely fuck up the
01:41:57 lighting on the bridge to like be like weird spooky like mood lighting because it's a movie now
01:42:02 we need to look cool we can't look like flat even comfy lighting like on the movie and everything
01:42:07 about first of all it's not canon second of all it sucks and it's try hard bullshit so uh star trek
01:42:13 is just so thoroughly patrician and star wars absolutely literal baby shit like i know you
01:42:19 can like both it doesn't have to be comparing the two it's just a nerd thing to compare the two but
01:42:23 god star wars is such baby shit it's just like why does when when sparta when the star star trek
01:42:30 star trek being patrician doesn't like it doesn't exclude star wars from being baby shit you know
01:42:36 it would be baby shit if star trek didn't exist that's true but you know when when sparta from
01:42:40 devil may cry was young he fought with the demon king mundus he was his right hand man but then
01:42:45 quote he woke up to justice when i was young i was a big fan of star wars you know i fought on the
01:42:51 side of star wars then i woke up to star trek that's what happened to me and now i'm on the right
01:42:56 side of history god when i when i put on any episode of star trek any series whether it's the
01:43:00 original or next generation whether it's deep space nine you know i put on any episode of star trek
01:43:05 and i just feel like i'm in a in a good place i feel like i'm in a company and i just wake up to
01:43:10 justice i wake up to justice let's have a shirt in the store that says hey i woke up today that's a
01:43:16 good idea this is a fucking star fleet logo on it oh yeah we can play into the waking up to
01:43:23 justice you know what you gotta do next legally distinct star fleet logo legally distinct star
01:43:28 fleet yeah oh my god we should have the bottom say joined legally distinct star fleet today wake
01:43:35 up to justice um the next the next thing the next thing that sparta did is he he in that in that
01:43:41 passage he woke up to justice and he stood against the legion alone that means you have to go fight
01:43:46 all the fucking episode nine videos now and talk about how star trek spades with us
01:43:54 like being uh uh uh uh a dis Privileged Minority in this country it's been but one non-star wars
01:44:00 fan standing against the whore at every fucking couple this it's basically the cultural equivalent
01:44:05 of the the oppressed gamer it's the oppressed star trek fan it's like the new crusades like they're
01:44:10 just going in slaughtering everyone who doesn't adhere to the church of star wars and corporate
01:44:15 corporate America is an in-club everyone who is a billionaire loves Star Wars
01:44:22 indeed and if you don't like Star Wars you can't be their friend and they
01:44:26 won't let you make money why that's how it is that's that's that's nepotism damn
01:44:30 right it is why is no one crony capitalism why does Star Wars never
01:44:34 get called out for being fucking corny cuz like you mean like the originals of
01:44:40 the new ones cuz like you know like Kingdom Hearts 3 came out
01:44:44 and all anyone said was how corny Kingdom Hearts is cuz oh it's oh it's
01:44:49 the light and then the darkness but then the light in your heart makes you good
01:44:53 but I don't want to be dark in my heart that's exactly what Star Wars is it's
01:44:58 this is a fantasy for autistic people who see everything binary black
01:45:06 and white you ever notice when you get those comments on your videos from
01:45:09 someone who you can tell is really autistic and they think that you're
01:45:11 just a bad person cuz you use like the word retard or or something you use
01:45:15 that yes like naughty language is it you're a bad person that's the kind of
01:45:19 people who see the world in totally black and white everything that is is
01:45:23 either bad or good light or dark that's what Star Wars is that's why it's so
01:45:26 popular it's a fantasy for autistic fucking retards who see they have a
01:45:30 question in terms of light side and dark side oh no I'm falling to the dark side
01:45:34 the space wizard is gonna make me turn to darkness in my heart shut the fuck up
01:45:40 oh my god we might have got stars over here which is all this like you know the
01:45:44 high concept actual stuff that's like a moral dilemmas that people can actually
01:45:48 like form like arguments for and think about philosophically and then you got
01:45:52 Star Wars over in the corner
01:45:54 yeah don't don't do that one dark sabers it's just Kingdom Hearts it's
01:46:03 exactly as stupid as Kingdom Hearts I've heard the comparisons to Kingdom Hearts
01:46:06 yeah yeah for sure for sure it's I mean is there any more comparison that's just
01:46:12 the low IQ version of the story versus the high IQ version than Star Wars and
01:46:16 Star Trek I don't know I don't know I mean like Star Wars is the low IQ in
01:46:21 Kingdom Hearts Kingdom Hearts well that's what are we gonna get the
01:46:27 Star Wars movie by Disney here well I'm that's true blue pill Star Wars sheep
01:46:33 over here well I'm so red pill that I'm fucking playing Kingdom Hearts like a
01:46:37 boss yeah it's 2009 again baby god I want to go back well that was that was
01:46:44 thorough good job team anything else going on I went to a thing I went to a
01:46:51 fucking comics yeah no not that no not that I went to this thing called the
01:46:56 Boston going gang meeting is pretty much like going to stand up comedy if you
01:47:01 know what I'm saying real clown at the podium if you know what I mean
01:47:03 much did you want to say something I do want to say something first of all check
01:47:07 out the enter the gungeon episode of endless war or I'm sorry of our yes so
01:47:12 you get some backstory and get some some I talk about yeah I talk yeah I want a
01:47:18 whole bunch about this in that episode yeah was kicked into shape in that
01:47:24 episode and and force and force to walk down the royal road and try and reach
01:47:29 up to his idol Tim Buckley and become the most proficient among on earth yeah
01:47:35 and yeah and the night but I told him on the episode that I would remind him
01:47:40 every single night to go that Thursday and I did and the night before and I
01:47:44 believe the night of as well I told him today is the day and and you went and
01:47:50 you and you reply to me quote it was fine so yeah we talked extensively about
01:47:58 the pros and cons of the comics roundtable and about how could you you
01:48:02 know can make or break things and how is pivotal that you were to go that's not I
01:48:06 don't exaggerate I think yeah that's I'm saying though to have our
01:48:14 incredibly long conversation of it turn out to be you know it was fine you know
01:48:20 I'm not just I want to hear well here's the thing well here's the thing really
01:48:24 that's kind of why I didn't want to go cuz I was like I'm saying that I think I
01:48:28 might just go in and might just be like no there's nothing really going on in
01:48:33 the episode you describe how it might be fine and there and then you would feel
01:48:36 like you have no more options left do you feel like you have no more options
01:48:39 left now yeah yeah now I'm trapped okay now I'm trapped now I'm trapped in the
01:48:44 cage of my own life options for what I don't get it what's the no escape well
01:48:49 the idea was that like I hadn't like been going out very much well there's this
01:48:52 thing that I could go to I used to go to it and it was fine anyway that it's it's
01:48:58 just like a club thing it's been running since like 2006 before I moved in with
01:49:02 Digi when I was living here before I went for a little while and like it was
01:49:05 pretty good I met some people it was fun and then you know they left and I came
01:49:12 back and I just I never got around to going back to it and now it's like it's
01:49:16 like every week at like I just like maybe another time maybe another time well I
01:49:20 went back this week and it was like I was kind of dead and I think maybe because
01:49:24 there was like there was like a gallery there was like a gallery opening like in
01:49:28 the building where it was happening not sure if that had anything to do with it
01:49:32 you know here's the thing right I get there and and it's a bunch of freaks and
01:49:39 I say that in like the most yeah loving way possible I say that in the least
01:49:43 judgmental way possible everyone's a fucking weirdo probably me you know
01:49:49 probably me too okay I'm really surprised that you would say that as a
01:49:54 majority because if there's some I would imagine that you would love to see
01:49:58 freaks and geeks well there's friends that are fun to hang out with and friends
01:50:01 that are you know freaks I mean freaks I don't know there's like alright there
01:50:09 were a couple I get there and there's a couple of there's a couple of non-binary
01:50:13 people talking about just how non-binary they are right in like they're
01:50:19 they're loving it and I don't think either of them even draw or write so I
01:50:23 don't know what they're doing there but they seem to be the ones in charge
01:50:26 okay like right off the bat that's pretty good good start then there's this
01:50:31 guy he looks maybe a bit younger than me he comes in at some point it becomes
01:50:36 clear that he's on the spectrum he uses he uses the word retarded to describe
01:50:41 see I start going off on a rant about spirit science and the love battleship
01:50:45 right of course I start I start talking about aligning my Kundalini and he's and
01:50:51 he is like you know amused by this and says like you know oh that's you know
01:50:55 that's retarded and one of these one of these non-binary people who seem to be
01:50:59 in charge of everything says like well she softballs him right yeah they saw
01:51:05 they softball him right and and they're like well you know I'm not gonna go full
01:51:09 SJW on you but you know don't use that word it's offensive and he is like he
01:51:13 tries to argue it and it's really uncomfortable so I leave for a while
01:51:16 and they go to the gallery opening and I steal and I steal some of their free
01:51:20 cheese platters that they have out okay they have so much cheese I eat so much
01:51:26 free cheese at that gallery oh bent that was the best part about caramel apples
01:51:31 do you remember the caramel I remember I remember I remember the caramel caramel
01:51:35 flowed like water that night yeah a good thing was before I went keto but but
01:51:42 um so there's a you know there's a couple of like older guys and girls who are
01:51:48 like you know like 50s 40s and 50s there maybe they seem to be a little more
01:51:52 serious about it you know they're fine they're fine there's like one other
01:51:57 like non-binary person question mark who seems like kind of less grating and
01:52:02 obnoxious than the other two she seemed fine but they seem fine but they didn't
01:52:06 say much they they were like new and then this guy who's next to me though he's it
01:52:11 comes out that he's on the spectrum at some point he says that and then he tells
01:52:15 me literally tells me about how his thing that he's been working on for years
01:52:19 is that he's just rewriting Naruto he's just rewriting Naruto and do I want to
01:52:25 read his manuscript and I say I'm sorry but I gotta go I really you know it's
01:52:29 time I think it's about time I should be hitting the old dusty you know I hate to
01:52:35 say it but in the real life a lot of people just suck and are very unimpressive
01:52:40 out the world sure it's unfortunate you know that's true listen listen listen
01:52:45 like when I used to go there were these people right there were these same
01:52:48 people like these guys who was just rewriting Naruto like this is not this
01:52:54 ain't my first rodeo yeah alright like it that doesn't bother me it did bother
01:52:59 me I don't know like before it seemed like they were more like mid-range age
01:53:04 people like 20s early 30s now it was like there was like this one one or two
01:53:09 like college kids and then like a bunch of like 40 somethings and I'm like I'm
01:53:13 gonna maybe I won't give up just yet maybe this is just a slow day or something
01:53:17 yeah yeah like it's possible because they were a cut I remember there were a
01:53:20 couple people that used to go that were pretty cool and I was kind of
01:53:23 disappointed that they weren't there anymore but whatever I'll stick it out
01:53:25 um so you're going you're going again yeah yeah I'll be going back okay I'm
01:53:32 looking forward there we wait there was shit there was one other thing that I
01:53:36 wanted to touch oh okay interesting thing it's it seems to me for my like
01:53:43 appraisal that the only person there who is accomplished at all right the only
01:53:49 person there who has like any sort of a presence or any sort of like a like a
01:53:53 thing going yeah is this person is this person I I don't know if I should say
01:53:58 their name I guess you're on the side of caution I suppose if you know you're
01:54:05 praising them aren't you I suppose well kind of well I don't know I just it's
01:54:09 just weird I don't know you dogged all right whatever their name is LB right
01:54:14 they go by LB they are non-bind right now this this is a different LB the LB
01:54:21 stands for Looney Brain and okay this person like wrote a book right it's like
01:54:26 a prose book but it has like illustrations in it right so it's like an
01:54:29 illustrated word like whatever so they made this book I don't know if they
01:54:32 kickstarted it or whatever but like they published it I looked it up there on
01:54:36 they're not they're not on Twitter but they're on itch.io is where their work
01:54:40 is or something yeah that's that's strange that's strange but whatever
01:54:44 that's fine but they were talking about an article that someone had written
01:54:48 about this person and in the meeting they were say yeah they did this great
01:54:52 article right up on you it was like yeah about like the best comic artist you've
01:54:56 never heard of right that's what they said sure and and I'm like okay so I go
01:55:01 online and I look up the name of the magazine that wrote this article up and
01:55:05 I look up the name of this person and I find the article but the full article is
01:55:09 titled the best comic artist you've never heard of is eight people and I read it
01:55:16 and it turns out that this person shtick or their deal or their thing is that
01:55:21 they have headmates or dissociative identity disorder okay I think the
01:55:26 article mentions dissociative identity disorder and they I think their work is
01:55:33 about living with headmates and that's okay so headmates is like the fake
01:55:39 version of actual dissociative identity disorder I don't know I don't know okay
01:55:43 I don't know what's fake and what's real anymore I'm happy to believe someone
01:55:48 has this but but this person this person's like got a patreon and stuff
01:55:52 okay and and like they're caught they're comparable to me they're making like
01:55:55 comparable amounts to me they're my only competition so I gotta kill them I gotta
01:55:59 you gotta you gotta use eight bullets to take this guy out cuz I gotta be the
01:56:03 biggest fish in this tiny pond or else of or else what do I have to live I know
01:56:07 the feeling well mm-hmm well that's interesting so so that's so that was my
01:56:12 that's my fucking Boston Comics roundtable story if you live hey if you
01:56:17 live in the Boston area the listener stay the hell away from me don't don't
01:56:23 fucking show up at these things in the show to be able to read a page of this
01:56:27 LB person and I want to say before I post it it looks like it's also ugly
01:56:32 art no it does no it looks like it looks like Erica moans art is what it
01:56:39 looks like it reminds me of you don't even know you don't even know who that
01:56:43 is I don't is that is that an actor on the room um yeah you got me ways is this
01:56:50 engrossed is this in the audio yeah yeah I don't mean to be money I fucking hate
01:56:55 you this does not look like my art at all I'm legitimately insulted I'm
01:57:01 legitimately insulted listen hold on I'm gonna get some it's okay this is not
01:57:05 a gem of your current or even to say that this is like only did you say it's
01:57:09 did you say it's also ugly yes well it's better than that it is better okay
01:57:15 no I'm not okay okay yeah you know what you did you did and I misheard
01:57:23 however no Erica moan is the Ojoi sex toy girl and this looks exact this looks
01:57:30 exactly like that yeah you're kind of right but not even that much worse it's
01:57:35 just very very simple you know there's like you know how like DC and Marvel
01:57:38 have like their house style there's like a house indie style which is this yeah
01:57:43 like there's a ton of artists who do this kind of like work it's very weird
01:57:47 yeah how that kind of just happens well maybe Erica moans not the only I just
01:57:51 have a quick question about am I supposed to I'm just wondering like am I to
01:57:54 believe from reading of like this comic that this is the the actual author of
01:57:58 this is does indeed have a split personality and eight people live inside
01:58:02 of them and this is a picture at least some of them is this the idea of like
01:58:06 that the comic I'm reading the comic not necessarily just for the quality of it
01:58:10 but because it's being written by a person with a split personality or the
01:58:14 dissociative identity Nate you know your guess is as good as mine on that okay
01:58:18 okay just wondering you know Ben much much like much like much like Sparta
01:58:23 himself you must stand against this Legion alone look good luck man you know
01:58:30 you know I don't know I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to be all like look at this
01:58:37 fucking look at this look at this shit look at like everyone's all like it's
01:58:41 all pandering it's all pandering to like queer identities and like it's all
01:58:45 identity politics it's all like a mental illness it's all like pandering to
01:58:49 like some weird thing I don't care right like if people like the stuff then
01:58:55 it's fine right nothing no there's no such thing as art that's not valid sure
01:59:00 right it's it's all it's all cool it's all good but it's very it's just very
01:59:07 perhaps it's it's kind of like Tom was saying like it's just it's just I wonder
01:59:14 if comics are even for like can I can I dang sis white guy can I can I under a
01:59:20 kind of white guy wake up in here in a downtrodden sis white guy even make it
01:59:24 in this comics world or is it just for is it just for people well you know Ben
01:59:28 I honestly like I look I look at it more and more and more it seems like this is
01:59:31 this is how you make it as comics it's like is when you're too fucking
01:59:35 disenfranchised and too much of a fucking weirdo no no offense for like
01:59:40 traditional or traditional or traditional publishing then like this is
01:59:46 what you get and this is where you find your audience you know they know where
01:59:50 you'll be they know where you'll be flushed out of the mainstream system and
01:59:53 where you'll fucking come out the drain here to making sequential art like a
01:59:57 fucking like a fucking peasants it's definitely become like a selling
02:00:01 that's all you deserve trans and I have people living in my brain you know to
02:00:07 like preface your art with that it gives you a kind of a built-in audience
02:00:12 it's stacking the deck with like social conditions yeah it's like yeah I mean
02:00:19 you know when you're a when you're a when you feel like you're a fucking freak
02:00:25 that no one understands yeah and then you see someone writing and they're
02:00:29 writing it's like hey me too you know I get it that makes sense yeah but I feel
02:00:36 like like Ben to correct me if I'm wrong but don't you feel like socially
02:00:41 different from the normal people like you're an outcast is there's no label
02:00:46 for what Ben is because he's just there's no label that's so yeah I was like
02:00:52 but the there's no there's no there's no adjective there's no there's no there's
02:00:59 no well-defined like category or group or like or like mass noun for the way
02:01:05 that I feel that I am I'm just gonna put on the Star Wars fan in my Patriot
02:01:10 you know what actually that's it that's it you saw you solve the riddle you see
02:01:15 that on someone's resume hire this genius immediately we need him on staff we
02:01:21 need this diversity of thought everyone else here's a damn Star Wars fan this is
02:01:25 a truly oppressed minority one one day I'll find one day I'll find some sort of
02:01:31 label to apply to myself that other people have already claimed so I can be
02:01:35 a part of a group identity follow this logic and have a built-in audience
02:01:39 follow this logic with me real quick I do believe that just for example like
02:01:44 every sexuality is on a spectrum and so one could relatively accurately assess
02:01:49 that there's no such thing probably as like purely straight or purely gay or
02:01:53 like anything like it's probably all in the spectrum including me so is it such
02:01:57 a stretch for me to like on my college application or job thing or whatever it
02:02:02 says like choose sexuality for me to just check bisexual or pansexual like
02:02:07 I'll take that I'll take that wider categorization is that such a crazy
02:02:11 thing to do can I get the ladies and gentlemen I don't think I don't think
02:02:15 you can argue against yeah do you really get cred for being right now I think
02:02:20 there's really hate the bias your softball and with that one there's no
02:02:24 downside to just telling people that you're bi yeah there is yeah well the
02:02:28 only thing that I know is that I know people who are gay don't like bi people
02:02:32 because they can pass as normative and so you're actually you actually kind of
02:02:37 go lower if you're bi cuz like even the minorities don't like you because you
02:02:41 can pass as a majority so you kind of get fucked from both ends you might come
02:02:47 off as a little you might come off as a little exotic to some extra straight some
02:02:52 extra extra square straight that's true I mean that's how many people like are
02:02:56 but about the fetishization of you know your girlfriend being a little bit
02:02:59 girls as well you know whatever yeah that's a thing you can you can you can
02:03:04 you can benefit you can there's there's some cred there's some cred to be at
02:03:08 least for some social capital to be a crude a little bit and why and I mean
02:03:12 just I'm just saying why not a crew as much as possible every little bit you
02:03:16 can get why not zoom it up like a classic yeah tactic you know I'm just
02:03:20 saying well I don't know if you get not not I say anyway so so the point is
02:03:29 that I go you know it's not even that I felt alienated or anything I didn't
02:03:34 feel weird like being surrounded by by you know by these by the drinks of
02:03:41 society I mean they weren't all that there were a lot of them but they weren't
02:03:46 all that or anything and you know I didn't feel like I didn't I did not
02:03:51 feel like I don't belong here I'm a cis white guy like it wasn't like that no
02:03:55 one was like making me you know cuz like I mean frankly that comment about don't
02:04:00 say retarded that's what makes me feel uncomfortable in a you know you know I'm
02:04:06 get why people don't like when you use that word I get it I get it that's don't
02:04:11 like it so like and you know she wasn't even that aggressive about it and like
02:04:15 the guy the guy should have just said sorry and not argued it you know I think
02:04:20 because he said he was I mean I think the reason he didn't do that cuz cuz he's
02:04:24 was on the spectrum and that's why you don't you don't always know how to
02:04:27 deal with a social situation that's takes a little bit of finesse and you don't
02:04:32 have that finesse you know who get a real pass on these issues just for
02:04:35 interest people with Tourette's people with Tourette's got a complete blank slate
02:04:40 pass they get the password pass they get the you know the f-ball pass they get it
02:04:45 all hey funny thing I was just like looking at twitch the other are you
02:04:49 talking about sweet Anita the girl with with with crazy Tourette's who will say
02:04:53 fuck my cunt muffin you know all kinds of things just I don't remember her name
02:04:58 but yeah she would she would say stuff like that probably sweet yeah but but
02:05:03 she would just I mean that wasn't really that weird cuz she would just say that
02:05:07 stuff like when she lost she was playing um you know Bennett Foddy getting
02:05:11 over yeah yeah and you know just like when she lost progress she would just say
02:05:15 these really weird swears and like you know that's not weird to swear when
02:05:18 you're losing at a game but the thing is she would make like she would like
02:05:22 click her tongue she would like she would like click her tongue and then she
02:05:26 would do like sort of a bird whistle like like I can't whistle but you know
02:05:30 you know what I mean like that she would she would do a little like bird like
02:05:33 tweet tweet like sort of whistle yeah thanks yep that's her she would just sort
02:05:36 of do yeah yeah and I was I was like that's that's funny I'm laughing you
02:05:42 know I'm laughing all the way to the bank you know it's it's well I mean she she
02:05:47 was like making a thing out of it right like it's like I guess it's kind of nice
02:05:51 in a way that you have like a disability but you like turned it into like a cute
02:05:57 gimmick that well her story popular on twitch you know it's really bad of me
02:06:01 but I don't know when I when I watch people with Tourette's I think that's
02:06:06 fucking annoying like well sure from me Tourette's person you're annoying you know
02:06:11 it might be cute to like watch a YouTube clip that's haha so funny imagine I'm
02:06:15 nothing against her anybody with it but like imagine living with that it's gonna
02:06:18 get annoying and I know it's bad cuz they can't help it obviously yeah I would
02:06:23 not want to be around that person for five minutes and that probably is why
02:06:27 they I mean for her she like couldn't get a job cuz like her Tourette's is like I
02:06:31 mean I don't know how advances but like she'll like slap people's asses when
02:06:34 they bend over and apparently she can't wait wait what I mean that's what she
02:06:37 said she'll like hump people's ass she will hump them if they like that sounds
02:06:42 like she's just using her disability to her advantage I mean I don't know I
02:06:47 assume I don't okay well maybe that sounds like she was okay if I have to
02:06:54 live with this like I can't stop swearing thing then I'm at least it's an
02:06:58 oh oh I also can't help touching asses and humping people that's part of it too
02:07:03 guys well like if this was like a man and like an ugly man I mean she's a cute
02:07:08 girl basically so I feel like it feels far less if this were a man if this were
02:07:12 a man he'd probably be locked up let's just be I mean maybe certainly likely but
02:07:16 I mean I mean he would be he would probably be like I don't know they true
02:07:20 people treated I'm just saying like what if she I actually have not heard her
02:07:23 make any like like racial epithets or anything like that but like what if it
02:07:26 was just to say like the end word or something with like Tourette's if a man
02:07:30 just streamed with all he would get is like you're an autistic piece of shit you
02:07:34 suck you're retarded go die probably I mean maybe we was really put together I
02:07:39 mean she's a cute girl you know she's got her she's you know that does looks
02:07:43 nice yeah skin yeah no looks normal and then just she has like a thing white
02:07:47 white as can be oh thank God you know so that's I mean imagine no like for real
02:07:53 like I'd probably be a lot harder it'd be it'd be a lot harder on her if she
02:07:57 wasn't white I mean I suppose I suppose I imagine so but I mean in the capacity
02:08:01 of like judging how like what like dangerous she is like why would that
02:08:05 matter on Twitch because that's what she's doing maybe if you're in general in
02:08:08 like her life you just you just get more shit you just get more shit and people
02:08:13 are like people like use it as an excuse to like fuck with you I mean that I'm
02:08:17 sure that's if they want to yeah that's probably that's probably fair to say
02:08:20 okay but the point is well I don't know what the point is fine her story oh you
02:08:24 know what I heard one thing that she said though that was like the reason she
02:08:27 she twitches streams is because like it's hard for someone with Tourette's to get a
02:08:31 job and like when she was younger because like she has all these impulses she
02:08:34 can't control she would have to do jobs that like allow her to be alone so she
02:08:37 would like walk down by the beach and like gather sea glass and then would go
02:08:42 to like the road or something and would sell seashells by the sea show that's
02:08:45 exactly correct that's exactly correct and I was just thinking to myself like
02:08:49 wow what a what an entrepreneurial spirit what I just found a place where
02:08:53 her disability was celebrated instead of shot oh yeah yeah I mean it's like if
02:08:58 you're a woman if you're a woman with a beard you don't get to go work at like
02:09:01 a regular people place you got to go to the circus where they want a bearded
02:09:06 lady they need yeah yeah sometimes you gotta go where everybody
02:09:13 streaming the circus also known as twitch yeah that's the circus of the
02:09:18 modern age that's that's I wonder if there are like bearded lady twitch
02:09:22 streamers oh but there are bearded ladies that stream on twitch probably you
02:09:26 know what I mean I mean I suppose with the rise of the the trans you know
02:09:30 awareness there's probably quite a few I'm not talking about a trans thing you
02:09:33 know you had they had bearded ladies in them in the in the circus no I'm with
02:09:38 you I'm with you I'm just saying how they probably migrated to twitch probably
02:09:42 more common than ever considering that's where people go to get their
02:09:44 entertainment now you ain't wrong you ain't wrong I feel like I feel like we
02:09:48 just accidentally created a dug standout bit wait a minute wait a minute now now
02:09:55 I'm wondering though yeah try it like trans culture like gender culture being
02:09:59 what it is I wonder if I wonder if bearded ladies are just have like a whole
02:10:02 different like outlook now I wonder if that's I wonder if I wonder if they
02:10:07 would probably just maybe just go ahead and identify as a man certainly pop I
02:10:12 mean who like do we know the specific like gender characteristics of the
02:10:16 bearded ladies I'll bet some do I'll bet some do but I bet not all of them do in
02:10:20 fact guarantee it guarantee not all of them do some people are probably just
02:10:23 like I'm yep I'm a woman and I got a beard and it happens and don't even
02:10:27 worry about it and follow me on twitch.tv
02:10:30 Ben saying all right well whatever enough of this bullshit we can go on
02:10:38 forever why don't we get to the voicemails already
02:10:41 unless somebody else got on top of it I wanted to bring up there's one time I wanted to bring up that I want to ask Tom because me and Ben on the endless war anniversary stream we played a
02:10:52 zoomie game oh yeah you know about that yeah yeah yeah we played we played a
02:10:58 zoomie so it was really cool been sucked at it been it wasn't hey Tom no I don't
02:11:03 suck your fucking controls are fucking sloppy it's fucking floaty it feels
02:11:08 like I'm walking on ice all the time and had to get back to fix it to play the
02:11:13 game okay slippery controls that's all I have to say where is a zoomie game going
02:11:19 from here what's the future of it look like it like I know you talked to me I
02:11:23 don't know if you said it on anywhere probably not in games but you said you
02:11:28 you've thought about making like a 3d game do you have any plans for that now
02:11:32 this is like a proof-of-concept way do you want to you want to work in the same
02:11:35 like you just like build levels on the same like engine all with all the assets
02:11:39 you've made just can have a sequel or what are you what are you thinking um yeah
02:11:43 I mean it really it really depends on like the reception of the game cuz like
02:11:48 it's only been out for a couple days I think like maybe a little less than a
02:11:51 week at this point and I'm still doing like a little bit of updates and shit
02:11:55 that like I increased the I increased the reach of the sword due to feedback
02:12:02 from the voicemail in the last episode and things like that so I did a little
02:12:04 bit of tweaking here and there but I mean if it gets like big and people are
02:12:09 really into it I'll probably start building it out and adding more levels
02:12:11 but like the end goal has always been to make a 3d character action game with
02:12:16 Izumi and like get the knowledge to do all that which is like insanely
02:12:20 complicated and over-the-top and will take years and years and years to develop
02:12:24 if the people I'm looking at who are doing things like that is any
02:12:28 indication to go by so I got to learn more about 3d like modeling to make
02:12:34 like better models that'll animate and deform better and then you got to learn
02:12:37 like animation and rigging and how to get the skeletons and stuff and then you
02:12:41 got to learn like all the coding that's and then it's just a huge fucking
02:12:46 process to do like a full 3d game like the engine I did Izumi in was not real
02:12:50 programming so you can do it really quickly that's why I was able to do it
02:12:54 like you know two or three months to get it like builds like the groundwork of
02:12:58 it so like at this point like I could go on to build a full game with it because
02:13:03 the majority of like the foundations there like it just matter building more
02:13:07 enemies and building more levels so I could probably do a game in a full game
02:13:13 with that style not super quickly but it would most of it would just be like
02:13:17 conceptual work of just like how do I want the levels to be as opposed like
02:13:21 having to learn more things to make it happen yeah so yeah I don't really know
02:13:26 so obviously okay so the end goal is a 3d game but obviously there's a there needs
02:13:31 to be a big leap in your ability wait wait wait the end goal is a 3d game not
02:13:36 a 2d platformer yeah I mean like like obviously this project was just like a
02:13:40 learning a learning experience but like I have like a whole big design document
02:13:46 for the final 3d game and I know the entire story and all the characters and
02:13:49 all that shit so the question is and I doubt it's the case but is this the last
02:13:54 we'll see Izumi before you just go away into a cave and like read a bunch of 3d
02:13:59 modeling textbooks and how to pull it pull a diva pull it I don't think I can
02:14:03 pull a diva just because I would go I would go full diva if I had money but
02:14:22 I don't so like to go to do would mean work a full-time 40-hour job and then
02:14:27 just not talk to anybody and do game stuff on the side I make no money it's a
02:14:31 solid plan to do such a thing so I don't know I just feel like like
02:14:38 DeVu made this fucking amazingly sick game and it's great and everyone should
02:14:43 play Automatus if they haven't already um yeah but agreed the problem with the
02:14:48 the going full DeVu is that like you have no base to be your evangelist to kind
02:14:53 of get it out there do you have a gay working for Digi of course that he does
02:14:57 the whole time right but what I mean is that like DeVu because DeVu doesn't
02:15:03 have a sweetheart deal and it is a good deal but like because DeVu has no
02:15:08 online presence really anymore like by his own design like when Automatus
02:15:12 dropped it was basically up to us to let people know it existed that and and like
02:15:17 I would want any like project that I do to have some semblance of success so like
02:15:22 it's not a matter of just building a big 3d game it's also like building a
02:15:27 brand around that game so like when it happens people give a fuck and that
02:15:30 requires constantly sucking the social cock and like making sure people don't
02:15:34 forget about you so like you can't just do one thing really unless you're
02:15:40 super god-tier talented which I don't think I'm at that skill level you know
02:15:44 what Tom I think I'm gonna argue with you on this because I think that's
02:15:49 something that a trap that I fall into is spending too much time on you know
02:15:55 sort of like ancillary side things you know just trying to like you know keep
02:16:00 keep keep up to date with people keep in the public eye you know be be streaming
02:16:04 on Twitch be like you know tweeting on Twitter liking people's liking people's
02:16:07 tweets you know being on this fucking show or whatever you know and like I
02:16:14 don't I don't know I'm like I've done a lot of it and I wonder like how much does
02:16:20 it like past a certain point how much does it really well do you think
02:16:25 like I don't think I don't think that being on the show anymore is getting my
02:16:28 name anymore out there than like it already is you know I mean it's both
02:16:33 theoretically if you dropped off perhaps that number would recede somewhat I mean
02:16:36 I just wonder like if I think I don't think if you just worked on the vapors
02:16:40 and that like and didn't talk to us and didn't do any of that shit and just
02:16:44 worked on the comic I don't think if you did a Kickstarter probably would have
02:16:47 succeeded as quickly as it did or if at all well you know your audience would
02:16:51 have been much smaller I mean what I would do I think there's a third path
02:16:54 here I like theoretically of you know ghosting and then just releasing it or
02:16:58 you know constantly maybe hyping it up or just keeping people like I'm a big
02:17:01 believer in like basically like release parties like a pomp and circumstance I
02:17:07 mean this is kind of what like like we Agua one sorry I mean sorry like like when
02:17:11 I did me a math I mean like that like I prepared media to come to make it an
02:17:16 event and I think people you know like I prepared a theme song ahead of time and
02:17:20 I prepared like you know art for obviously you've done that already but
02:17:23 like something and I am aware that's totally different from like a comic
02:17:26 release like a game release a totally different thing but I like I would do
02:17:29 something along those lines maybe like construct a website for it and to like
02:17:34 not even when the game releases but like to let people know the game will release
02:17:37 on this day like maybe it's already ready maybe it's and I this is why you
02:17:42 know they announced you know Final Fantasy 15 like eight ten billion years
02:17:47 before it actually comes out or whatever and then you know they keep you
02:17:50 interested with trailers a good strategy for working on a big project's gonna take
02:17:54 years and years because I watched I followed tons of indie game devs and
02:17:57 obviously we don't have the resources for all that jazz it's just documenting
02:18:00 your progress you know and like yeah like that becomes your content like if
02:18:04 you just let everybody know what you're working on daily you know there's like
02:18:08 there's an artist minions art she's working on a game called Astro cat I've
02:18:12 been following her for like two years and like I don't even know how much
02:18:15 progress if any has been made I just know that it's being worked on okay they
02:18:18 do they do that in tutorials and make thousands of dollars on patreon or how
02:18:22 about how about our beloved our beloved yandere dev right oh I don't like seems
02:18:28 to have fallen into a bit of a trap of yeah yeah actual game design development
02:18:32 someone someone who decided to not learn about proper programming is well you
02:18:35 know he is among other things I'll take his word for it wait who's yandere he's
02:18:40 yandere simulator yandere simulator it's like a question I don't know it's a
02:18:46 game that people liked and streamed on twitch and on YouTube it actually got
02:18:50 banned from twitch because it's too too edgy too saucy that's correct really
02:18:54 there's like there I guess maybe I don't think he appealed but they said no they
02:18:59 don't want it on twitch so I mean he's been through some issues but I'm gonna
02:19:03 get on D live not you know not even to shit on the model but like it does seem
02:19:06 like a potential trap like I don't know when you're a pull up when you're a
02:19:09 politician the trap is to like be corrupt or whatever when you are a game
02:19:13 developer using crowdfunding to support ongoing development of your game
02:19:17 there's probably gonna be some pressures to like you know why why rush it you know
02:19:21 this is going pretty well I'll just sit here and you know maybe goof off a little
02:19:24 bit not work as hard but to the contrary that point there also is gonna be
02:19:28 unbelievable pressure on you all the time to get it done and that's also I'm
02:19:32 just saying that for me that far outweighs yeah yeah yeah oh I got
02:19:36 because like for me my brain works like if I'm not releasing something I am a
02:19:40 failure once you said that there will be a game my only question for the
02:19:44 developer from that moment on is when do I get to play it I don't care about
02:19:48 anything else I want to play this game that's been prophesied and promised to
02:19:52 me so yeah it's gonna be a tricky spot same like a movie I guess or anime when
02:19:56 can I watch it it's tough cuz like you're doing like I if I could I would
02:20:00 love cuz like there's a couple options I could go full divu and just make a big
02:20:04 3d game and just like drop off the face of the earth and just do nothing but
02:20:08 CG cookie tutorials for the next like year and a half yeah get become God and
02:20:13 just start building this huge game cuz that's like what m.strange it is right
02:20:17 and he's like my big like inspiration artist guy he's been working on this
02:20:20 big platformer game for years and like every like seven or eight months he'll
02:20:24 resurface and be like here's a vlog k bye and and that's it and like I don't
02:20:27 know what he does I don't know how he makes money time job he must I don't know
02:20:31 he doesn't he's never talked about finances even when I press him because
02:20:34 I've talked to him you know one-on-one for it and he refuses to answer that
02:20:37 question about how he makes money crowdfund development of his games no
02:20:41 he's never crowdfunded ever so he must so he must in some he there there has to
02:20:46 be something right but he just refuses to like you know let anybody know how
02:20:49 it's done probably to like keep his air of mystique up because he just seems like
02:20:54 this guy who like fishes doll heads out of gutters and makes movies about them
02:20:58 because that's what literally happened with his first movie but um like that's
02:21:02 one option another option would be to keep making smaller projects build up
02:21:05 the brand and get it to a point where like if I asked for like hey I want a
02:21:09 programmer and a you know a soundtrack designer and like work on a team with a
02:21:13 bunch of people to make a big game and I have the cloud to actually attract people
02:21:16 to do that then I could offload a lot of that work right and focus on like the
02:21:21 creative part that I'd like actually enjoy the most which is like that's a
02:21:24 long game so right but it's I mean it's all a long game like to make a full
02:21:29 3d action game even if it's just like at ps2 level like a ps2 game still costs
02:21:33 millions of dollars back in the day you know full development teams make so
02:21:37 yeah and now you're doing it by yourself so you're like it's probably like a five
02:21:41 plus to your project easy and that's after I've learned everything so like it's
02:21:46 just like such a moonshot project I don't even I don't even have enough skills
02:21:49 to know to quantify it yeah I know what I'm a boy with a dream you know that's
02:21:54 that's it I know what I would do and it's because what I did do it's like I'd
02:21:58 work a full-time job or whatever and just like do it on the side I that's just
02:22:03 me that's just me I would prioritize like my financial stability with the goal
02:22:08 of eventually being at once like I've I've checked my boxes oh Nate you and
02:22:12 your ridiculous dreams about financial stability you and your crazy
02:22:17 seems like more of a moonshot than making a video game to me at this point yeah
02:22:21 I can't even I'm just saying it seems like our generation has just said like you
02:22:28 know fuck life I'm just gonna make art and if I die or I don't know like you
02:22:34 guys are literally what I said I think I've literally in the mirror like
02:22:38 looking at like looking at myself like like like like peel like peeling down my
02:22:43 eyelids to look at like and like my red eyes and stuff yeah and like shaking
02:22:47 dandruff out of my hair I've been like fuck life I'm just gonna make art and
02:22:51 if I die from some like sociologist guy and I don't remember the specifics I'm
02:22:58 probably gonna mangle this but he had this theory that like the the last four
02:23:02 generations have perfectly mirror the four generations before them and how it
02:23:07 sort of goes in cycles how like you have a generation who's all like who's all
02:23:12 entrepreneurial and then a generation that's all political and then a generation
02:23:15 that sort of detaches and becomes artists and then a generation after that
02:23:18 that sort of does whatever the fuck and how it mirrors so and like the I think
02:23:24 like the millennials were like compared to like sort of like I don't fuck it
02:23:29 remember like the lost generation from like the 30s like before yeah okay and
02:23:33 and the zoomers the new silent generation that's fucking fake news I
02:23:40 mean I think the greatest generation it was an interesting thing so whatever I
02:23:46 mean I mean I mean I would read I would read that article I would read that
02:23:52 article because that doesn't surprise me that like it seems like a that you
02:23:57 know yeah cuz like each generation is a response to the last yeah yeah in a way
02:24:01 so yeah I mean because everybody everybody says that like to go on the
02:24:07 the social media thing I had a thing I wanted to say that oh it's right here I
02:24:11 found it sorry okay link it like in the in the link link link that show while I
02:24:16 speak Strauss how a generational theory and I'll link it word cool the social
02:24:22 media general like a presence thing and and like either social media or like
02:24:28 working full-time on the thing going a full devout which I like this phrase I
02:24:31 don't know how he will feel about death of the victim I feel like so much like
02:24:49 having a social media presence is it's like the more you put into it with the
02:24:58 less you have to show while you're into it the less effective it will be like if
02:25:03 you have one game and you build your social media presence it making a brand
02:25:08 will be so much easier than if you have a game in development or no game and you
02:25:13 try to build a social media presence because people will want to follow you
02:25:16 but you'll need to have something and so you'll have to create something for them
02:25:20 to gather around even if that is just like you as a like a personality or a
02:25:26 vlog or whatever so but then they will become accustomed to knowing that thing
02:25:31 rather than what you actually want them to like in the future which is your
02:25:34 products your games your art your webcomics and stuff so the more stuff
02:25:38 you already have doesn't matter whether it's like the best thing you'll ever
02:25:41 make or your magnum opus the more stuff that you can link to them when you do
02:25:48 the social media or like like a press tour you know like how people go on to
02:25:52 to talk shows and say yeah I got a book out you know that that's the sort of thing
02:25:56 I think is the best way to do it is to only be social when you have something
02:26:00 to tell everyone you know and if you you know is the perfect example like the
02:26:05 on that far side of the spectrum who gravitated from content less social
02:26:09 media and then just completely flipped Spoonie of course is drifted over time
02:26:12 and just flipped those two to being zero content 100% social media interaction
02:26:18 that is the most taxing on the viewer's patience I mean that's kind of
02:26:22 different because I don't know what Spoonie wants I assume he just wants to
02:26:26 kill Donald Trump as I understand it and God bless him in his quest like he
02:26:30 clearly doesn't want to make videos anymore but he's an internet person
02:26:33 now so it's kind of difficult for him to leave that but like it I feel like it
02:26:38 would be worse to have build a following that likes you for certain things and
02:26:45 then when you release the you finally have you know you've spent half your
02:26:49 time social media half your time on the thing so it's taken twice as long and
02:26:53 now you finally released it and your audience they're not not necessarily
02:26:59 going to care about the thing because they know you for something else yeah
02:27:02 you know perfectly real on the subject like I'm perfectly aware of kind of how
02:27:07 I'm taxing the patience of my audience many of whom have expressed in no one
02:27:11 certain terms like okay Nate Gurren Lagann reviews are really good when's
02:27:15 the next like good project coming we're all we patiently waiting Ghost in the
02:27:20 Shell was how many years ago that was announced any day now would be real nice
02:27:24 Nate so I mean I feel I feel this tension as well yeah I mean in the few
02:27:30 in like if it continues in whatever fashion your audience will be comprised
02:27:35 primarily of people who care about we Agua and when you drop a big video they're
02:27:40 gonna be they're gonna watch it a little bit but it's not gonna be the thing they
02:27:44 were craving so you gotta think smartly about like what kind of audience you
02:27:48 want to build and are you doing that yeah with your shit so yeah it's a good
02:27:52 point yeah I mean the issue like I think I mean Nate I mean you you can
02:27:56 probably relate on this cuz of what you started doing with those big reviews is
02:28:00 that like in a perfect world you could do that and be fine you know but like if
02:28:06 you're trying to like build an audience online like everybody now with social
02:28:10 has like the attention span of like a goldfish like if you're not like throwing
02:28:14 your face in their face and like letting them remember that you exist
02:28:18 they'll just move on to something else because like no one's starved for
02:28:20 content you know so like unless you're at like the super high top tier like top
02:28:25 5% of just like raw ability that every time you do something it's like a
02:28:29 fucking bomb going off in the social media landscape yeah like you can't
02:28:33 really just like disappear and only come back like every year or so with
02:28:38 not good enough you will be forgotten I've been working full-time the entire
02:28:42 time I've been doing it now but like maybe not the very beginning but close
02:28:45 to it and yeah like those original projects while I was working like took
02:28:49 six months to make so like yeah that's totally unsustainable for that although
02:28:53 I mean I still believe that like those guys like like John Tron's videos I know
02:28:57 he's already got a big following but like they get kind of an unbelievable
02:29:00 amount of views when one drops and I think people just love the production
02:29:04 value but you know what never mind he's a terrible example because like he's
02:29:07 already basically made it and people already love I mean there was there was
02:29:10 a time when you could do that and get away with it I just think yeah starting
02:29:13 now like it's impossible I still I don't think it's impossible but I think the
02:29:18 bar is significantly high yeah it's yeah it's it's very very very difficult and
02:29:23 like so I'm just like being realistic with myself is like I don't have that
02:29:27 kind of ability you know I'm not that good yet so I would have to either you
02:29:33 know get a job which is not as cut and dry as it sounds just because the way my
02:29:39 student loans are when I get a job I'll automatically lose over half my paycheck
02:29:43 just to increased bills so like I have to juggle the fact of like and then my
02:29:47 my tax return I start owing way more my taxes because like there's just the way
02:29:52 taxes work with like some self-employed income on top of like working a job
02:29:55 because like when I did nothing but do patreon and made like no money I got
02:29:59 money back but the next year when I worked full-time for like two-thirds of
02:30:03 the year I owed like three grand so like doing all that math out it's like
02:30:06 getting a job might actually make me poorer and not richer as fucking weird
02:30:11 as that sounds yeah so like like it's it's and you're not gonna figure it out
02:30:15 for like a year until you get fucked on that so it's just it's a cluster fuck it's
02:30:19 really real at the bottom of the like the income tiers there like I just
02:30:24 actually yesterday have like this huge list of like all this different like
02:30:27 content I would have to make like like podcasts and videos and like a YouTube
02:30:31 channel and like all this stuff on top of making the game just to like be
02:30:35 relevant and like have people not forget and it's just like a huge it's a huge
02:30:40 undertaking like you have to be a brand today you know I'll just come out and
02:30:44 say it Tom I mean I I think you should stay on the podcast here I think that's
02:30:48 going great I'm happy to have you as all that big most of us are like if I had a
02:30:52 personally give you my recommendation I would say find some decent job and do it
02:30:58 on the side and like and then you have total freedom like I think the podcast
02:31:03 keeps you relatively in the public eye you know hopefully you can earn enough to
02:31:07 escape that trap again I have no idea maybe I'm talking out of my ass oh he
02:31:11 was just talking about getting a job making right but like I don't like he's
02:31:15 got a degree in graphic design or something there's probably something out
02:31:18 there that's pays well I don't know maybe I'm totally wrong and there is no
02:31:22 opportunity for it I keep I keep thinking about I keep thinking about what
02:31:27 if I what if I tried to land a job doing something that like a studio or
02:31:31 something or what if I what if I could like storyboard something that'd be
02:31:36 cool I have no idea where to even begin yeah I mean I've been thinking about
02:31:39 because like I have to learn programming anyway and I was like I actually asked on
02:31:42 Twitter yesterday like because I know Python is a really in degree in demand
02:31:46 language I get a programming job like I'd probably be able to like escape the
02:31:51 bell curve and actually like get a net positive I was doing something beyond
02:31:54 like flipping burgers or whatever yeah that's oh my god oh my god as as a as
02:31:59 opposed to you know escaping the bell curve what you want to do as it says
02:32:05 now you're begging people to ring that bell you the bell is omnipresent in your
02:32:09 life but just depends on how you you know you treat it if you want to skip the
02:32:12 curve then you got a job but if you want to stay in presence ring that fucking
02:32:16 bell below his video right damn now everyone we're all we're all trapped
02:32:21 under that bell ain't that the truth bring that came crashing down well I
02:32:27 don't know Tom I I hope I didn't sound like I don't know I don't know I mean I
02:32:31 think about all this all the time yeah it's always like juggling
02:32:35 different calculation is it would be great to have a job if it would make
02:32:39 things better right that's pretty much my point yeah well if it would make things
02:32:44 better right right now well I don't know life's hard we're all gonna die hey
02:32:50 viewer hey viewers tell me tell me where I should tell me where I should
02:32:54 apply to be like a storyboard or something yeah what do you got people dude
02:32:57 fucking do something universe dot com do something useful you know this this goes
02:33:03 against a lot it's been built up in the PCP well maybe not I'm sure I'll be
02:33:10 guys like it but I'm like excited to have like a normal job I think that will be
02:33:15 cool at least to do for a while that like pertains to art in some way I think
02:33:19 I'll be really nice and I'm just looking forward to it is all I gotta say I I get
02:33:24 I get excited thinking about the prospect of being like a storyboarder I
02:33:27 think if I could I think if I could have a job for like a studio I would like or
02:33:31 like a real job like that's what I would want to do I think that sounds great and
02:33:34 I know people do it but like you know I think those jobs are really in demand yeah
02:33:39 despite like for like a real lot of Cal Art graduates out there looking to draw
02:33:45 a whole bunch a whole bunch of people with more art with more art art you know
02:33:50 education with more degree you know then the degree the degree might be to
02:33:54 somebody's edge but a website that hosts one's body of work could I don't know
02:33:59 perhaps that's even an evening factor if you've got actual I mean it can't hurt
02:34:04 right it can't hurt certainly not of course not anything I mean I don't know
02:34:08 if I was hiring I would just want to see that they like had like I don't know
02:34:12 who's better that that's what they say that's what they say like a degree
02:34:15 doesn't mean anything if your portfolio isn't impressive like it's all about the
02:34:18 part yeah yeah all of it when it comes to the art I hear that it's all about the
02:34:22 portfolio it's all about the portfolio and it's also not in like the like
02:34:28 interview since like whether you're my job but in order to get into interview
02:34:32 it's more important to have like connections you know I wouldn't want
02:34:35 the degree itself does not help you I mean I'm just having the people like know
02:34:40 like where to go and what to do my only connect too bad my only connections are
02:34:45 you free that's fair although I mean like theoretically if I was like applying
02:34:48 for like a managerial position somewhere you know what I do I would cite my
02:34:54 experience like not running purely but like doing the account like they quote
02:34:58 unquote running the PCP like I get everybody together for calls you know
02:35:02 doing all the account work distributing pay like on a relatively
02:35:06 consistent basis of a couple days here and there but you know and I'd like to
02:35:10 think that people would like I would show them the income like this been
02:35:14 generated and then when people like whoa there's actually like some decent money
02:35:17 here this isn't like a little bullshit baby diaper poo poo pee pee adventure
02:35:21 you're having on the internet here well I wouldn't go I wouldn't say that it is
02:35:25 bad let's not go over for it that's fair but it's just classic instant laughter
02:35:34 that's all you got to do ladies and gentlemen put that down in your comedy
02:35:37 portfolio put that on your resume I mean so I just my point is like for your
02:35:42 application to clown college yeah like all the stuff that we're filling out
02:35:46 right now right in the show for years and like running our own YouTube channels
02:35:50 and all that stuff I like to think that it could all be leveraged as to show that
02:35:54 at the very least that we're go getters in various capacities so I often sell
02:36:00 myself short when like explaining to people what I've done like I brush over
02:36:05 the internet stuff when I really shouldn't I should think of like a way to
02:36:10 say it more normally I think that's the struggle because the amount of work I
02:36:14 have put into my YouTubeing stuff is so disproportionately high compared to
02:36:19 every other pursuit I pursued in my life that like an employer should know
02:36:23 that like you have that kind of I mean you just have to be honest yourself and
02:36:27 just like yeah I'm running a business yeah I'm an entrepreneur and like you
02:36:31 always you always see like that guy who like talks himself up all the time and
02:36:34 like you kind of think he's a cock and he's annoying like oh I did this and I
02:36:38 did that like I was watching an interview with Enzo Amore who's like a wrestler
02:36:41 yeah and he was just talking about like everything he's got going on like super
02:36:46 positive about everything like I'm the coolest guy in the world man I can do
02:36:49 this and I like like well that's a lot of accolades he's building himself up as
02:36:53 having but then like when I think about it I'm like wait a minute who's to say I
02:36:57 couldn't just say that about myself and say get myself all those accolades that
02:37:02 I do have I have done a lot of cool stuff I just never say cuz I I never
02:37:06 like act proud of it cuz it's yeah that's that's that's the way you sell it
02:37:12 shameful but if I wanted to I could just as easily go around and just like you
02:37:18 know like train my brain to be more of like a go around every day like hey it's
02:37:23 me I'm this guy and I do this thing it isn't that fucking cool and said I'm
02:37:28 just I go around every day I'm like don't fucking talk to me leave me the fuck
02:37:31 alone who the fuck are you get out of my fucking way I mean it reminds me of a
02:37:35 little bit thing I've heard Tim Poole say a few times which is like just when
02:37:39 comes to selling like here I got something to sell you guys
02:37:41 Hydric acid please sign my petition Hydric acid has been known to kill
02:37:46 millions over countless lives it has it poisons of people have been known to
02:37:52 ingest it and die over a certain amount you know it's ruining environments in
02:37:58 certain locations it's displacing entire populations and Hydric acid is
02:38:03 water so let's ban water let's ban Hydric acid boom I got you all to sign
02:38:07 the position you've been finessed and outgenious by me cuz I'm just is it the
02:38:14 dihydrogen monoxide that's the one that's the one yeah it's no good it's no
02:38:18 good for anybody but it sounds scary cuz it's got the word acid in it and all
02:38:21 those things are generally true so yeah I mean salesmanship is everything for
02:38:26 something like that I think our whole generation needs to talk itself up more
02:38:29 and like there's a lot of like I want to die jokes about millennials and stuff
02:38:35 and this is why I roast I feel such strong contempt for every Twitter user
02:38:40 with a self-depreciating Twitter bio I when I see that they're like I want to
02:38:45 die I have no skills it's that the funny have to like there's a self-deprecation
02:38:50 economy you have to put yourself down or else people say that you're an ego
02:38:54 you know I mean people like that claim about me too I am called the best guy ever
02:38:58 but I don't know I hate you talk yourself up and talk proudly about
02:39:02 yourself at all the only people who hate that I call myself and so amore yeah
02:39:06 while I was watching his interview being like man this guy's really he's done a
02:39:09 lot of cool shit people hate him because he has the nerve to say yeah I'm great I
02:39:13 do great shit what you can't you know who you know but you know who hates them
02:39:17 yeah fucking losers if you're hated by losers who fucking cares I mean that's
02:39:22 there you should care because there are more losers than there are now there's
02:39:25 can still be customers made of losers losers are the majority vote what they
02:39:29 think about you is all that fucking matters in life because they can and
02:39:33 will destroy you all you have to do is get to agree with you I mean as soon as
02:39:37 the internet was created as soon as social media became a thing the world
02:39:40 was irreparably taken over and co-opted by losers losers are the driving force of
02:39:45 all society the driving force of your life they will destroy you if they deem
02:39:49 that you're not as much as this guy is successful right like he's clear he's
02:39:54 got all this shit going on and it is working so like how how effective is
02:39:58 the cries of the loser masses other than like a smear campaign before they like
02:40:03 oh but this guy we got to take down next you know like again attention span is
02:40:06 like not because everybody hates him I mean yeah but like if enough people hate
02:40:10 you then they can just fucking lie about you and then that's it doesn't matter
02:40:13 what you've done your career is enough people enough people yes but I mean if
02:40:17 you are able to build yourself enough of a shield to avoid that that's one thing I
02:40:20 mean for me the biggest hate I feel like I've ever gotten was on my fairy tale is
02:40:26 dead time to dance on the grave that's the only time I really remember when
02:40:30 people to this day still get mad at me for shitting on fairy tale and being so
02:40:35 excited that it is dead and this thrills me and they're like best guy ever more
02:40:38 like worst guy ever am I right ladies and gentlemen of the jury you should you
02:40:42 should be proud you should be proud of shadow I feel proud I feel very much
02:40:46 proud but no don't let don't let anyone take that away certainly not certainly
02:40:50 but like but that's the if I just I don't know let's say I made a video saying I
02:40:54 love Star Wars the last Jedi it's my favorite movie and that makes me feel
02:40:59 good that the things of this movie happened these events transpired then
02:41:04 you know like yeah good man you are the best you can be like that kind of guy
02:41:09 who you can just be like oh I don't mind the haters I don't pay attention to them
02:41:13 they don't matter yeah you can tell yourself that and you can even believe
02:41:17 that but it's not true the haters do matter if they matter something about you
02:41:23 then that's you that the haters matter but like I mean I object I feel this
02:41:29 about myself I just don't feel I generate enough haters for it to be a
02:41:34 problem and that's that's at least partially by design like I do try to not
02:41:38 come off like an asshole all the time so you know that that's a tactic one can
02:41:42 take it might perhaps it's inauthentic to some people though and like they just
02:41:46 are more acrid in there in their day-to-day so maybe that doesn't work
02:41:49 for everybody to still feel like they're really being themselves but I mean I
02:41:53 just don't feel like I get that much hatred or anger on the internet because
02:41:57 I'm relatively easy to talk to or get along with I don't know tapping you know
02:42:02 I was so I was at this thing I was at this this comics thing and you know they
02:42:07 were like you know new people introduce yourselves and you know he got to me and
02:42:10 I'm like you know I could like what do I say like I say like you know you know I
02:42:15 should say I'm on a podcast so I should I say like I got like I'm on Twitter I
02:42:20 got like oh I got like thousands of Twitter followers like should I say I
02:42:23 got a comic at well I could say I had a website or say you know I was thinking
02:42:29 maybe I should mention that like I did the successful Kickstarter last year like
02:42:32 that's a thing like that'd probably be around and finally I was just like I don't
02:42:35 want to as like as like you know if you know they'll find you know you know what
02:42:40 maybe they'll find out about this later you know better better to undersell now
02:42:44 and have them like learn impressive stuff later that might there's stuff that
02:42:48 might impress them later so I was just like yeah my name is Ben Saint I make
02:42:53 comics on the internet I draw and I write and make comics on the internet I think
02:42:56 that was my whole thing I was like you know what the line between more can more
02:43:01 can come out later more more info can can come to light at a future date
02:43:04 where is the line perhaps being proud of yourself and if I didn't work it like
02:43:09 it's in the mind of the moment I guess yeah and everyone's different and
02:43:13 everyone's stupid yeah well that's you're not allowed to be proud of yourself
02:43:17 as my point you're just not allowed to have any pride in anything you do at all
02:43:21 or else you're an egomaniac and you're an asshole and your piece of shit and
02:43:24 you're I definitely feel this a lot because like like I I find like I do
02:43:30 this to myself like I always my brain just kind of mentally downplays
02:43:34 everything I do as a defense mechanism because like like raw like gross
02:43:39 egotism revolves me so much and so I overcompensate to make sure I don't come
02:43:44 off as that but then I just come off as pathetic so it's like you got to find
02:43:48 that balance yeah I mean that's the true your own self if nothing else I feel
02:43:53 the opposite I want everyone to be an egomaniac I want people to just be I
02:43:57 want everyone to just be like I'm great I like I want to be confident I want to
02:44:01 have pride why won't you fucking lose right it's the most powerful thing
02:44:06 everybody down to your fucking level you were like fucking crabs if you can
02:44:14 give me like a choice between like do you want skill or do you want confidence I
02:44:19 would absolutely take confidence because I was confident I can I would believe
02:44:23 that I could like build my skills and I wouldn't follow through and actually do
02:44:26 it confidence is the most powerful weapon in the entire world and it sucks
02:44:31 that mine's not up to par yeah I suppose I feel like I feel like an APS
02:44:36 adventures dot site to read a really good webcomic bail Jake with a fucking
02:44:41 animation coming out very soon I've been and it's really good and I like a dangerous
02:44:46 game to be saying stuff like that why I need I don't know I mean well all right
02:44:51 the animation coming out soon dangerous understandable but it is like it's not
02:44:58 going to take I mean I've been saying oh spelljeeps nearly had done for a long
02:45:02 time but I didn't realize what I was going to do at the end when I first
02:45:05 started saying that and it has changed but now it has got to the point where
02:45:09 half the line art half the keyframes and in-betweens are done and it will take
02:45:13 relatively less time to finish the second half of it and then color it in all
02:45:17 right well cool I'm thinking I'm thinking like you know a month and maybe maybe a
02:45:22 month from when I say this and it'll be I just I just like to keep mentioning
02:45:27 that I have a webcomic because I feel like people like I appear on podcasts
02:45:32 and people just don't really know it's good yeah it definitely feels like
02:45:38 obscure hippo it's it's that I don't know I feel like it goes back to sort of the
02:45:43 thing with the website where it's like APS adventure that just sounds like oh
02:45:47 hippo one day decided to do it for fun and he made it like a homestuck clone
02:45:51 because it would be funny to do on stream and people don't like take it
02:45:55 seriously I feel like you got to push it more for people to and try to make it
02:46:00 more interesting they'll take it they'll take it seriously when they see the
02:46:02 animation because it is sick and a lot of the shots I've already finished are
02:46:05 like oh that's so good I will talk about talking about that's the good thing
02:46:10 right there yeah talking up good stuff you've done I mean it's not done yet
02:46:13 obviously but now we will be he's working out right now I mean I derive
02:46:16 almost all of my confidence in life from the fact that I have done the things I
02:46:22 just think back to like I don't know I don't know like when I was younger it's
02:46:25 like man like I don't know talk to this girl I don't know what she's gonna like
02:46:29 me and then I'm like oh yeah remember that time I fucked that bitch I could do
02:46:32 that again let's just talk to this girl no problem and then I do and you know
02:46:35 it's okay and I'm not saying that makes it super easy or anything but it just like
02:46:39 it's like I just think back to when I did the thing that I'm about to do before
02:46:42 when I think back the things I've done I think oh god I'll never be able to do
02:46:46 that again maybe that's the difference right there it's like it's the focus on
02:46:49 the positive or the negative I don't know I feel like I was just like I was
02:46:53 born with like a natural confidence like I think I've always just naturally been
02:46:57 confident but like my entire life all anyone's ever wanted to do is just crush
02:47:03 that confidence out of me and my whole life I've had to stifle myself and
02:47:07 stifle my true potential and my true greatness to try and fit in with the
02:47:10 rest of the fucking meat sacks walking around here who just can't handle anyone
02:47:14 being proud of themselves for anything I just want all human beings to die all
02:47:20 everything's got confidence because I'm sick of them I'm sick of them holding me
02:47:23 back holding each other back it's all they're good for every once in a while
02:47:29 beings are just worthless and should all die fair enough but you know who's got
02:47:33 comments and doesn't deserve to die commenters on my galco video such as
02:47:38 the one who just commented who left this comment galco Chan who I praise endlessly
02:47:43 in the video galco Chan is literally me just in blonde it makes me happy to
02:47:47 finally have an anime representation this person has the right kind of
02:47:51 confidence to make in this world they see themselves as a shining god all I do
02:47:55 is endlessly talk up how wonderful galco is and here's a person like it's
02:47:59 literally me incredible just stupendous as always YouTube commenter with that

02:49:19 side a little 2d thing and I will I will be continuing it if for no other
02:49:23 reason than to continue using it as an exercise to get better programming and
02:49:27 stuff God bless voicemails okay there you go all right first let's check in with
02:49:31 our quest as ever to find the pizza party podcast let's see what we've got
02:49:36 message from I I don't know I just I think it might be a fool's errand but
02:49:40 now it may be let's check in with I don't know if it'll ever happen
02:49:43 has some update for us so let's see what he's got you people make me sick to my
02:49:51 fucking stomach although I actually have sick for unrelated reasons you people
02:49:57 are actually going to waste innocent lives on this stupid little quest to find
02:50:03 this supposed podcast sacrifice everyone you're the only person who's
02:50:09 aware that this thing even exists but since you don't know where it is how do
02:50:15 you even know it's real to begin with now since you have faith real you have to
02:50:24 become the pizza party podcast Ben think about this way I can't I don't have the
02:50:30 glory than the real podcast don't have a pizza and try to stop you oh that's
02:50:36 true they'll have to expose themselves to you and you'll find them that way
02:50:42 huh fair hey you know what this reminds me of Tim Poole just is filing like a
02:50:55 lawsuit or something because he's got like a he's like his branded content
02:50:59 it was under like the heading subverse and like a week ago or two weeks ago a
02:51:04 porn like website group of developers launched a Kickstarter for a porn game
02:51:11 called subverse and who knows if it's like intentional to like fuck with this
02:51:15 guy I mean I don't know if they've had like some interaction in the past or is
02:51:19 it just a complete coincidence and like the result the search results have
02:51:23 completely crowded out Tim Poole it smashed like a bunch of records on
02:51:27 Kickstarter it's got like six hundred thousand dollars right now or something
02:51:30 and the term subverse has been completely co-opted by this point what's the
02:51:35 original it's it's like the the website that Tim Poole does like for news or
02:51:39 something don't yeah that's like the gist of it it's like it's okay like this
02:51:45 guy Tim Poole is like an independent journalist it's like his news YouTube
02:51:49 basically that's it so I don't know like so that it did trigger a response from
02:51:55 from Tim when this person made this other thing so if we just go create
02:51:59 okay so I will so I will I'll just have to start you know I'll just have to start
02:52:03 doing a segment that is the pizza party podcast the only podcast called the
02:52:08 pizza party podcast on the internet that's the selling point and I mean I
02:52:13 got I don't know what it'll be about like pizzas I don't fucking know like your
02:52:18 review types of that's gonna be dude oh you know what first episode of the new
02:52:23 and improved one and only pizza party podcast I will review Arlo's low-carb
02:52:28 pizza crust recipe that's a good idea and if that falls through I'm uniquely
02:52:33 qualified if that falls through you can always do like train like railroad
02:52:38 track reviews and go click-and-clack down the track okay next up we've got
02:52:43 another another piece of party podcast related this is from hide the podcast
02:52:48 robot okay go
02:52:51 hello procrastinators it is I hide the podcast robot I find it only fair that I
02:52:59 inform you of the fact that you will never find the podcast me and my elite
02:53:04 team of automatons will stop at nothing to obscure the location boss I found
02:53:12 someone who is trying to say where the podcast is kill them that's like all we
02:53:17 do why do you need to console me on this well I thought like maybe whatever you
02:53:24 thought was wrong this will come up in your next performance review leave
02:53:31 well PCP I'm off to go suck the spines out of humans who know the location
02:53:38 was ill-offended can watch out God God God God speed you're doing God
02:53:47 it's gonna be an absence of spines in the man maybe I don't know I find the
02:53:52 part yeah that's true we've got actual enemies to fight against now and our
02:53:56 ongoing I don't I love my spine well I wouldn't say you might say I'm kind of
02:54:00 attached where I keep all my spine goo they can take my spine my spine's been
02:54:11 broken for months and I don't want it anymore fuck it they might be doing
02:54:14 here's but I'll find the Pete I'll find the pizza party podcast and I'll
02:54:18 convince them that you're me and they'll suck your spine out that sounds
02:54:22 fair and then I'll be on Scott let's do it okay we got another one this is from
02:54:27 proud the greats the great spine okay so here's our first real voicemail it's
02:54:33 proud echo quotes Jew ham boy so proud ham boy let's let's see what this is
02:54:41 about I thought it was odd that Ben was so focused in the plight of the Jewish
02:54:45 people a few episodes ago so I decided to do some investigative journalism I
02:54:49 hacked into patreon.com flash Ben St. found a list of his top patrons Gal Gadot
02:54:55 Jerry Seinfeld Woody Allen the list goes on it's just as expected by God Ben's gay
02:55:02 liberal outrage actually just a Zionist dog whistling we also see it I
02:55:12 could have told you that all you had to do is okay that's some good that's some
02:55:20 good what happens we don't brag about your people get confused to what your
02:55:24 true motives are okay we've got another mail from some engineer hope they
02:55:31 engineered a good mail hey members of the PCP cheers from Columbia I wanted to
02:55:38 develop a actual PCP bot that will be able to take some scripts and convert it
02:55:45 into an actual audiophile with your generated voices during to sit you can
02:55:52 share it some of your clean audio with me or maybe I could take it from some of
02:55:57 your videos but it will be ten times easier if you could give me some of
02:56:02 your I do folks I will leave my mail or additionally I could message you on
02:56:08 this court although I don't use it that much additionally I hope you're doing
02:56:14 well and I hope man the best for your family I'm not used to a genuine
02:56:27 there's no ridicule there's no there's no joke it's just like hey so this guy
02:56:32 normally it's exactly the sort of thing I hate which is him asking me to do
02:56:36 anything but luckily we've got a solution which is the editor contest like
02:56:41 files that we produced you know several episodes I don't like two months ago now
02:56:45 or something that were in those episodes you can just use those files and that
02:56:50 doesn't have every single member but there's like six or seven of us in those
02:56:52 so go grab those from a couple episodes ago this requires no effort from us and
02:56:56 all on you which is exactly how I like it would that be any or with which I
02:57:03 mean which episode with it's in the description there's links to the editor
02:57:07 contest stuff so if he looks back at the lat like go like five or six episodes
02:57:10 ago and then maybe go back one or two you'll find it quickly it's there
02:57:13 somewhere maybe if I'm smart I'll remember to put the link in the
02:57:16 description but probably not by the way the editor contest is a thing that is
02:57:21 yes that that's true votes have been tallied and we are in the process of
02:57:26 talking to yep that's correct everything's going swimmingly it is
02:57:30 progressing smoothly we have actual ranks of people and stuff now so expect to
02:57:37 hear updates very soon everybody keep your ears peeled okay next one is from

02:58:42 yeah I also just really love digitally altered low-pitched voices they're
02:58:49 really funny I agree completely it's different it's different it's different

02:58:57 throat or you know the only thing you have to do to get on the voicemail seat

03:02:57 pixel edges and it looks really weird it'll look it'll just be that yeah okay next voicemail is from
03:03:03 what do go hey pcp yo i've been trying to make content for years but i delete everything right
03:03:12 before it's finished out of sheer hatred from my own work what do i know that you have to stop
03:03:21 you have to stop making these
03:03:25 uh i think we all have an idea yeah i have an idea stop deleting it okay what you should do yeah
03:03:34 when you find yourself in this situation okay like i know the feeling of like completing a project
03:03:38 like 90 percent and then that last 10 percent you know generally like takes 90 percent of the effort
03:03:43 or whatever like just for the sake of the exercise forget the quality forget the art you're making
03:03:49 you all you have to learn this skill just finish it because you like swore on your father's grave
03:03:55 with his samurai sword clenched in your hand that you would finish this project and then release it
03:04:00 and just detach yourself from it being good or not finish it specifically to grind the skill
03:04:07 of finishing something let that be your motivation exactly exactly nate uh ghost in the shell best
03:04:14 anime ever best one correct that's it yeah that's that's the thing yeah literally do that uh it is
03:04:22 it is definitely a skill to finish it is you are in you are in the you are in the bad mental habit
03:04:28 of deleting stuff of working on stuff not finishing it and then deleting it and you gotta you gotta
03:04:33 break that you gotta break that habit in your behavior so like if you're you gotta practice
03:04:38 you gotta practice a better way some people worry that like their projects maybe they're like a
03:04:42 little bit older than other people or something they're like oh man like people younger than me
03:04:46 by contemporaries are already so good like if i start just for example like drawing now it'll
03:04:50 just be like embarrassing to release any of this like stuff now you gotta get over that you have
03:04:55 to get over that because if you're serious about it you will improve rapidly and uh you know it's
03:05:00 like the you gotta generate the first thing the first thing that you put out will be bad no matter
03:05:05 what yes but the 50th thing you put out might be good and the 50 so get there as fast as possible
03:05:12 unless you put out the first thing exactly that's a great way it's like our boy jake said sucking
03:05:17 it sums the first step to being sort of good at something yep exactly uh yeah that's that's the
03:05:22 way you gotta break that mentality uh okay that's those that that's what do thanks for the call next
03:05:28 is uh michael reeves theory uh i i i have i have pcp email like no figure yeah yeah on my phone
