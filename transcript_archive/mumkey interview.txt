00:00:00 Hello, everybody, and welcome once again to the Pro Crastinators Interview series, the one that's been on hold for six months.
00:00:07 Forever?
00:00:08 Yeah, after a mere five episodes, but we're back.
00:00:11 Hey.
00:00:12 For some reason, that reason being, we've got a new member of the Pro Crastinators podcast who's interested in being interviewed.
00:00:19 Is it Sheepover?
00:00:20 No, Sheepover...
00:00:21 Is it Psy?
00:00:22 Sheepover declined to...
00:00:23 Is it King Critic? Who could it be?
00:00:25 Oh man, three hours of King Critic, can you imagine?
00:00:31 No, it's Mumkey Jones!
00:00:33 Mumkey Jones!
00:00:35 Look at that audio clip, there we go.
00:00:37 Maybe I'll turn it back down.
00:00:43 So, Mumkey, what is it that made you want to be a part of this little club, this little gay ass internet arrangement?
00:00:54 So, clearly, I didn't have the same background as you guys did, you guys all met with your pony days and all that shit, and that's kind of...
00:01:03 Pretty much everything you guys represent is what I set out to humiliate and destroy.
00:01:08 Yeah.
00:01:08 So I was as surprised of being invited as I was that you guys even liked me in the first place.
00:01:14 Yeah.
00:01:15 But I think it's because after finding out who you guys were and being invited to be on episode 30, I think that was the empathy episode,
00:01:24 I watched most of your guys' stuff and I liked the vast majority of it, and I thought you guys were all cool guys,
00:01:30 and I thought, you know, I'm more than flattered that they liked me too, so hell yeah, let's get on board of this shit.
00:01:37 Yeah.
00:01:38 From our perspective, it was like, I mean, from the very first time I saw your videos, I was like, well, this guy's clearly coming from a similar angle to us,
00:01:47 but like, you know, we didn't know who you were, and then after...
00:01:52 It's one of those things where it's kind of the way that people have gotten into the PCP, and this is why there's this weird misconception that you can just join the PCP by having good enough videos.
00:02:03 Which you can.
00:02:04 Please send all of your amateur videos to DigiBro.
00:02:06 It's digitalboyreviews at gmail.com.
00:02:09 Like, the general way that the PCP formed was by all of us being big fans of one another, and with Monkey, it was just kind of a case that not only were you clearly like all of our videos, and all of us like yours.
00:02:22 Well, most.
00:02:23 Most.
00:02:24 Yeah.
00:02:25 Well, we like...
00:02:26 I've seen Ben's work, not impressed.
00:02:28 Initially, it was just Jesse who found you, and then he showed you to me.
00:02:32 God bless him.
00:02:34 When I find a YouTuber who makes like one video I like, I watch all of their catalogs.
00:02:39 So as soon as he showed me the BegottaHK video, I watched like every one of the videos on Earth.
00:02:43 You were fucked.
00:02:44 Because I had like a new video every day at some point.
00:02:46 Yeah.
00:02:47 So I watched all of it, and I was like, oh yeah, this guy's really cool, and I really enjoyed the Nuzlocke series, because I'd never seen such a like high production Let's Play before.
00:02:58 Hey, that was me attempting to emulate the style of Pro Jarrod, because I really liked his Nuzlocke series, but I think I did it better than him, even though he's like a big shit.
00:03:08 Well, it helps that you're funny.
00:03:10 Yeah, and Pro Jarrod is a total normal.
00:03:12 His audio mixing, we don't need to go too deep into this, because I know how much you love talking about audio mixing, but it's hard to hear him, because he has the game volume.
00:03:20 Too loud.
00:03:22 This is a struggle to get through, because I can't hear half the shit he's saying, and he doesn't do any audience interaction.
00:03:28 He's like makes up sounds, and I'm like, okay, I can take his formula and perfect it, get some audience interaction with the names, polish up the sound a little bit more, even though in the fire red days I was using like a shit microphone.
00:03:39 But I still think it was better than his, you know.
00:03:43 I mean, this is somewhere that me and Endless Jess don't quite see eye to eye on, is that I really like the audience interaction aspect.
00:03:52 Oh, he doesn't like it?
00:03:53 Well, he just hates the audience.
00:03:55 Yeah, he hates the idea of interacting with the audience and letting them get away with being a bunch of idiots, which you kind of do.
00:04:02 Which if I handled it, I wouldn't handle it the way you do.
00:04:05 What do I do?
00:04:06 I would have audience interaction, but it would be on my terms.
00:04:10 You kind of let the audience run wild and say whatever they want.
00:04:13 You mean like in the Nuzlocke, what do you mean?
00:04:16 Well, I just mean in general, like you interact with your audience a lot, but regardless of what they say, you will interact with it.
00:04:22 Like if they shit talk you, you'll still put that in a video.
00:04:25 It's funny.
00:04:26 For me, I would, I love having discussions and stuff, but like if someone's just talking shit, I'll just ban them, you know.
00:04:33 And then like I'll promote the, it's about cultivating your audience.
00:04:38 Like what you want them to be like is how you sort of promote them.
00:04:42 But you've kind of let yours just run free and do whatever they want.
00:04:45 I think it's because you and I are making very different types of content.
00:04:48 Yeah.
00:04:49 Mine are very much the, like this is the wild west of the internet where anything goes.
00:04:54 And I'm going to say the edgiest, most offensive, racist things I can think of.
00:04:58 I'm going to make fun of everybody.
00:05:00 No holds barred.
00:05:01 Whereas you're like, you know, let's, let's analyze this show and appreciate it or hate it.
00:05:06 So I, it makes sense that I would want more of a wild west.
00:05:10 The internet is a hellhole sort of comment section.
00:05:13 Whereas you would want a thoughtful discussion of a soul eater.
00:05:18 Yeah.
00:05:19 Hey, soul eater is cool.
00:05:20 Yeah.
00:05:21 He said it in a cool way.
00:05:22 He's excited.
00:05:23 It's cool.
00:05:24 I'm a baby.
00:05:25 I'm 12.
00:05:26 Anyways, so you, uh, yeah, you've got, you've got a very active comment section.
00:05:31 I imagine,
00:05:32 It's my favorite comment section.
00:05:33 I imagine that your audience interaction is heavily inspired by the, the biggest problem
00:05:39 in the universe podcast.
00:05:40 Oh, sure.
00:05:41 I could see that.
00:05:42 Yeah.
00:05:43 They would always bring in voicemails of people shitting on them and it was the funniest
00:05:46 stuff.
00:05:47 Yeah.
00:05:48 And that's like, I always wanted to get more in on that, but it doesn't fit my, again,
00:05:51 like you just said, we're doing very different kinds of content.
00:05:54 And like for me, uh, if I just make, if I'm tried to make a video like one of yours, it
00:06:00 would just be weird.
00:06:01 You know, like on the main channel.
00:06:03 Yeah.
00:06:04 Like it just, it wouldn't inspire the same kind of interactions that yours would.
00:06:09 Whereas like with Maddox, he's kind of had that character for so long that it was like,
00:06:13 you know, people were talking to him the same way they would have on the old website.
00:06:18 Um, you know, I remember one of the early videos I saw from you was the monkeys anime
00:06:24 reviews, monkeys anime reviews.
00:06:26 When I review myself.
00:06:27 Yeah, but you, you cite all these things that you've been ripping off and a lot of them
00:06:31 were stuff that I also was a fan of.
00:06:33 And I was like, when I saw a fucking biggest problem, not only that you put in Maddox, but
00:06:38 also Dick Masterson, I think, and I was just like, Oh my God, this dude knows his shit.
00:06:43 Yeah.
00:06:44 Um, and a touch on that a little, I mean, this is.
00:06:47 I touch on everything a little bit.
00:06:48 This is, this is breaching away from just you personally.
00:06:51 But you are like one of the only people I know who got into biggest problem via Dick
00:06:56 Masterson.
00:06:57 That's right.
00:06:58 That's right.
00:06:59 And what's the deal with that?
00:07:00 So I was on poll one day.
00:07:02 The best four-chan board.
00:07:04 Oh, okay.
00:07:05 Let's go back in time about 10 years when I was a sophomore in high school.
00:07:10 10 years.
00:07:11 Well, let's go back in time about six, seven years.
00:07:15 I would have been like 15 or 16.
00:07:17 So yeah, about five years.
00:07:19 I found the, the Dr. Phil clip, the infamous men are better than women with Dick Masterson
00:07:25 on Dr. Phil.
00:07:26 And I was really inspired.
00:07:27 I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
00:07:29 And I bought the book.
00:07:31 And then in my sophomore year, I did, you always have to do those book projects in high
00:07:35 school, like read a book and write a letter to the author or write a three page report.
00:07:40 So I did mine over the biggest, or I did mine over men are better than women by Dick Masterson.
00:07:45 But little 15, 16 year old mum, he didn't know it was satire.
00:07:49 I thought it was a real like guy.
00:07:52 I was like, what, this guy has the coolest name ever.
00:07:55 It's perfect.
00:07:56 So I wrote this.
00:07:58 The letter I wrote to the author was kind of satire because I just wanted to piss off
00:08:03 my teacher because she was a hardcore, like feminist, you know, feminazi bitch.
00:08:08 I was like, okay, I'm going to write a letter to the author praising his genius piece of
00:08:14 work, men are better than women.
00:08:16 So then that's the end of that.
00:08:18 You know, Dick really didn't put out anything else that I could find.
00:08:20 Did you not get any trouble for that essay?
00:08:22 She thought it was funny.
00:08:23 Yeah.
00:08:24 So she has a sense of humor, at least.
00:08:26 Mine would not have.
00:08:27 No, not.
00:08:28 My also feminist AP English teacher.
00:08:30 You probably would have gotten sent to the guidance counselor.
00:08:33 Again.
00:08:34 Yeah, again.
00:08:35 But then fast forward, I guess three or four years later, because I couldn't find anything
00:08:39 else from Dick.
00:08:40 He kind of, the character disappeared and he went off and daxed at his own thing.
00:08:44 But then I'm on poll and I see there's a whole thread about how Dick Masterson just
00:08:51 did a podcast episode about SJWs and I'm thinking, what the fuck?
00:08:56 Yeah.
00:08:57 What?
00:08:58 That's a dream come true.
00:09:00 So of course I clicked the link and there we go.
00:09:02 It's like what?
00:09:03 Episode 50, something of biggest problem.
00:09:05 I'm like, holy shit.
00:09:06 This is a gold mine.
00:09:07 There's a whole Dick Masterson podcast.
00:09:09 I didn't know who Maddox was.
00:09:11 I had never heard of him up until that point.
00:09:13 Haven't even seen him at that point.
00:09:15 So I go listen to the back catalog.
00:09:16 It's the best podcast I've ever heard.
00:09:18 So yeah, I joined it.
00:09:20 I started listening because of my love of Dick.
00:09:22 And then I grew to love Maddox and now it's a full circle of...
00:09:27 Yeah.
00:09:28 It's a...
00:09:29 What's the...
00:09:30 A parabola.
00:09:31 Sure.
00:09:32 It's a roller coaster because you go on the ride but you end at the same place you get
00:09:35 on.
00:09:36 Yeah.
00:09:37 So you took a lot of influence from that podcast in the way you interact with fans,
00:09:43 reading comments on the show, allowing lots of shitposting.
00:09:46 It's a shame you don't have a voicemail.
00:09:49 Yeah, that'd be fun.
00:09:51 If people sent me like a soundcloud of them shitting on me, I'd probably do an episode
00:09:56 about it.
00:09:57 It'd be fun.
00:09:58 I always thought it's interesting how you take it kind of to the next level and that
00:10:01 you've had people just outright make videos on your channels.
00:10:06 What is the deal with Baku Boys and it all that?
00:10:10 How does that come to pass?
00:10:12 Baku Boys in particular is just somebody who over the last year of me doing this with
00:10:19 an audience, he's just like somebody who became my friend and he wanted to do a parody of
00:10:24 the show, which was just this unwatchable garbage of a parody, parody anime review.
00:10:32 And Mumkey Jones 2, my second channel, which used to be my main channel until it got
00:10:36 striked and I was like, nope, I'm not putting up with this, time to start over.
00:10:39 And now that the strikes are gone, Mumkey Jones 2 is my designated shitposting channel
00:10:44 and I just straight up said, anybody can send me anything and I'll put it on this channel,
00:10:48 I don't care.
00:10:50 So that's how we get the Cream Man, Nuzlocke Let's Plays, we get Baku Boys, Terrible Reviews,
00:10:56 there's all kinds of fun stuff on there.
00:10:58 Because I mean it's just a shitpost channel, you know, it's fun.
00:11:03 So how many YouTube channels have you had?
00:11:07 Oh god, like my whole life?
00:11:10 Infinite number.
00:11:11 I was talking to Jess about you and he was saying something about you being fairly new
00:11:16 and I was like, well, I'm pretty sure Mumkey Jones is like not even close to your first YouTube channel.
00:11:22 It's just the first one that's gotten popular.
00:11:25 What is the first YouTube channel you ever made?
00:11:27 What year and what was on it?
00:11:30 First one I made was when I was 11, so actually 10 years ago, and it was called Nubs because
00:11:37 my nickname in I guess middle school was Nubs because I would pull my arm inside of my shirt
00:11:42 and then just stick out the elbow so it was like I was a war veteran who got his arm chopped off.
00:11:47 So everybody called me Nubs back in the day.
00:11:49 Have you ever not been a human shitpost?
00:11:51 I don't think so.
00:11:53 I would get in trouble all the time in elementary school.
00:11:56 My whole life I've always gotten in trouble for just trying to be funny.
00:12:00 For being what we in professional circles refer to as a little shit.
00:12:05 Yep, I mean some people seem to like it.
00:12:09 And on that channel I would, my mum had like a shitty little tiny picture camera,
00:12:15 but it could also record videos so I'd have my little brother Patsy who would have been 8 or 9 at the time,
00:12:20 record me doing like Chris Angel Mindfreak parodies and I was also a fan of the movie Super Size Me
00:12:32 with Morgan Spurlock where he eats McDonald's every day for 30 days.
00:12:35 I started doing parodies of that where I would like drink milk for 30 days
00:12:40 or be trapped in my bedroom closet for 30 days, but I mean obviously it's fake.
00:12:45 I'm just doing it all the same day.
00:12:47 It's all sound genius. How watchable are they?
00:12:50 They're not. They're awful.
00:12:52 I don't think they exist anymore because that channel, so this is the first time I got a channel taken down.
00:12:59 I assume for copyright reasons.
00:13:02 Or possibly community guidelines violations.
00:13:06 So I was 13 at the time. I'm 2 years deep into this channel.
00:13:10 I got just tons of horrible, unwatchable garbage on there that I would relentlessly like post all over the internet
00:13:17 because I wanted to become YouTube famous as all 11 year olds tend to do.
00:13:21 This is 2007, right?
00:13:23 Well now that you're 13 it's 2009.
00:13:26 So like YouTube celebrity is not really a thing yet.
00:13:29 It's just that we knew there were some videos that were big.
00:13:32 That was back when Little Caribo and AVGN were celebrities and they had like 40,000 subs.
00:13:37 Yeah, and they weren't even really on YouTube at the beginning.
00:13:40 Yeah, they're on websites.
00:13:42 Yeah, I knew both of them at the time, but I didn't associate them with YouTube at all.
00:13:47 I also didn't think they made money.
00:13:49 I didn't think anybody was making money doing this until Game Grumps revealed that they were making money in the first episode.
00:13:57 So here's how the channel got taken down.
00:13:59 This is the downfall of nubs.
00:14:02 There's this video I found.
00:14:05 I don't remember what it was called, but the premise is that they have an Elmo toy.
00:14:10 And this is like a professional film company made this video for their channel.
00:14:14 And it's called like, it's like Elmo's a pimp.
00:14:17 And Elmo's like, I'm gonna bitch slap a hoe. I'm Elmo.
00:14:21 It's like that kind of thing.
00:14:23 So what I did was I downloaded their video and then I uploaded it on my channel and I called it Elmo's a pimp in all caps.
00:14:32 And it got like a good amount of views.
00:14:35 So you just straight-free booted their video.
00:14:38 So then the company-
00:14:39 Why did you think that was okay?
00:14:41 This is not the end of my hubris, my friend.
00:14:44 So the company very politely just sends me a YouTube message saying, hey, this is our video.
00:14:50 Can you take it down?
00:14:52 God, this must be like way before the whole content ID day.
00:14:55 It's way back in the day.
00:14:57 I can't even imagine a company politely messaging me to take my video down today.
00:15:03 Believe it or not, I did not take advantage of their kindhearted gesture.
00:15:08 Because I reply, I'm ready.
00:15:14 I'm like, hey, this is a good opportunity for me.
00:15:18 I said, how about you make a video like making fun of me or something?
00:15:23 Oh, I see. You tried to game them back.
00:15:26 And then the next day my channel was deleted.
00:15:29 Wow.
00:15:30 It didn't work.
00:15:32 That's a little shit when I was 13.
00:15:35 That was a foolish endeavor all around, I would say.
00:15:37 So all those videos are gone.
00:15:39 Why in the first place did you think it would be a good idea to re-upload their video?
00:15:43 Because I was like 12.
00:15:45 I thought it's popular, so I'll also get...
00:15:48 What even could you rip it with back then?
00:15:50 Did they have YouTube rips? Websites?
00:15:53 They must have. We had something.
00:15:55 Yeah, well, so that's your first channel, Dead.
00:15:59 So I'm assuming you didn't have any side channels at the time.
00:16:02 It was just that one.
00:16:03 I didn't know. I didn't need any side channels because nobody was watching.
00:16:06 So what's the next channel you make?
00:16:09 Then in, I guess in high school I had one that still exists,
00:16:13 but once Monkey got big I changed the name and I put all the videos on private.
00:16:18 So all these videos are still out there.
00:16:20 And I can post them sometime, just not yet.
00:16:22 I'm biding my time for these ones.
00:16:25 But these ones, like, maybe there's some that are watchable, you know?
00:16:31 What kind of videos are they?
00:16:32 Like sketch comedy, kind of stuff.
00:16:35 I've talked about this other places, but we did a kind of a game show
00:16:40 based off of impractical jokers and kind of like based off a jackass
00:16:44 called Challenge Showdown where my group of friends, each episode,
00:16:48 one of them would be randomly picked to do a crazy challenge,
00:16:51 like chug five, five hour energies at the same time,
00:16:55 or go into Walmart and throw spaghetti all over the cash register person.
00:16:59 Now how bad is the production quality of this shit?
00:17:02 Are you talking like barely audible wind noise everywhere?
00:17:06 Um, most of it was filmed indoors, so it's not too bad.
00:17:11 Wait, one of them threw spaghetti at a cashier.
00:17:13 Yeah, that's inside Walmart.
00:17:15 We were filming inside the store.
00:17:17 Oh my god, you didn't get in trouble for that one?
00:17:20 No, we left. We ran out.
00:17:23 Well, so okay, you had this show, then just sketch comedy.
00:17:29 Yeah, I had a sketch show.
00:17:31 I started a film club in my school because I wanted people to make videos with me
00:17:36 because like nobody really wanted to.
00:17:38 I was the only guy in the whole school making videos.
00:17:40 So I started a film club and the show I started using the people who joined the film club
00:17:46 was called Family Sitcom.
00:17:48 I wanted to call it Family Shitcom, but it was associated with the school so I couldn't.
00:17:53 And the idea was I wanted to, every week I wanted to have a new sketch out
00:17:58 and I did that for about two months.
00:18:01 And some of those are pretty golden actually.
00:18:03 Some of them I consider to be like the best things I've made.
00:18:07 So you've always been pretty prolific.
00:18:09 Yeah, I've tried to keep myself to a schedule.
00:18:12 Yeah, because I think it's the most important thing about building up skill is to work fast
00:18:21 and get lots of stuff out there.
00:18:23 And it's especially important when you're young.
00:18:26 Like you build up that speed and that stamina and then you never quite lose it.
00:18:30 It's like once you've done a video every week then you now know that that's a thing you can do.
00:18:36 So then going into the future you are always like, well I know I did that before.
00:18:40 So I know it's possible.
00:18:42 And something that pisses me off is I'll always see comments about like,
00:18:45 oh, monkey, it should be quality over quantity.
00:18:49 And I'm like, bitch, fuck it, they're quality and they're quantity, fuck you.
00:18:53 Well, I mean that's the thing, it's like you can do, if someone only gets out one video every six months
00:19:00 and it's extremely high quality, but you get out a video every week
00:19:04 and at least one out of four is extremely high quality, who's got the better channel?
00:19:08 Yeah, I would rather watch a weekly show that's like a six out of ten
00:19:14 than watch one episode of a ten out of ten show that comes out once a year.
00:19:18 That's just me and I can see why people wouldn't like that as much,
00:19:21 but I'd rather just have more consistent shows.
00:19:24 Yeah, it's helpful for, it works well with what YouTube is now, which is a replacement for television.
00:19:31 No one's watching TV, we need something to be, we need a constant drip feed of YouTube content
00:19:38 to fill in our day and as much as I love those ten out of ten videos
00:19:45 where I can go back and watch them again, it's like this isn't helping me on the daily grind of my life
00:19:51 where I need there to be a certain number of hours of YouTube content every day,
00:19:56 which for me, I don't get enough of it from other people so I just make it myself.
00:20:01 Yeah, you have to make your own videos.
00:20:03 I think I heard that DigiBro just watches his own videos all day because they're so good.
00:20:08 I heard that somewhere, I don't know where.
00:20:11 That's not true at all.
00:20:14 So what do you watch?
00:20:17 Because in spite of making a channel called Mumkey's Anime Reviews, you don't really watch much anime.
00:20:24 No.
00:20:25 And you've indicated a few times that you don't watch a whole lot of YouTube, it doesn't seem like.
00:20:32 No.
00:20:33 So what do you spend your time on? What do Mumkeys get down to?
00:20:38 Most of my day is just spent sitting there wishing I had something to do.
00:20:45 I've said this a million times, the best treatment for depression is distractions,
00:20:52 and I think my problem is I keep running out of distractions and that's why I always feel so depressed all the time.
00:20:58 That's precisely why up until you come, like all I've been looking forward to all month is you coming here today,
00:21:04 and then me planning what I'm going to do for the next month and a half,
00:21:07 because I've been depressed for most of this year so far,
00:21:12 and the only thing that's going to get me out of it is...
00:21:14 That Donald Trump election, man. Really got to you.
00:21:16 I don't even care about that.
00:21:20 But I've been depressed for most of the year and it's mostly because there's not enough to do,
00:21:25 sitting around in your room, even if you run out of YouTube videos, you're fucked.
00:21:30 You're just like, well, I don't know what else I'm supposed to be doing right now,
00:21:34 and watching anime is too tied to work for me, so it's not as relaxing as it should be.
00:21:39 You can't just sit there and watch, you have to analyze everything.
00:21:42 Or even if I could, I just feel like it's all tied to work somehow.
00:21:49 But I'm like, I need to get out of the house or just hang out with other people,
00:21:53 and I'm like, well, at least I'll know that the weekend that Mumkeys at my house,
00:21:56 I won't be depressed because we'll be doing things.
00:21:59 We'll just occupy our time.
00:22:01 And the best part is, I don't have to look at Twitter, I don't have to look at my YouTube comments,
00:22:05 because I don't need something to distract me from what's going on.
00:22:09 And Twitter and comments are just going to make you more depressed.
00:22:12 Right, exactly.
00:22:13 Well, that's the thing.
00:22:15 The only reason to look at them is that you have nothing better to do.
00:22:18 I would never go on Twitter at all if I had anything to do,
00:22:22 but because I don't, I'll just sit there and read people talking shit about me all day
00:22:27 and getting more and more angry and making more and more drunken rants,
00:22:31 all because I'm too bored and I don't have enough to do.
00:22:36 But I'm certainly not thinking about shitty commenters while we're doing a podcast,
00:22:42 aside from the fact that I'm referring to them.
00:22:45 So, all right, we kind of got off away from your YouTube videos.
00:22:48 I still want to know more about your other channels.
00:22:50 So, you've got the one that's all set to private right now.
00:22:53 What came next after that?
00:22:55 Then came The Mumkey and Big Show, which is what got this whole Mumkey thing started,
00:23:00 which was just a shitty Let's Play channel with me and my old pal Biggs,
00:23:05 who has appeared in a few anime reviews.
00:23:07 And a lot of Drunken Minecraft.
00:23:09 Yeah, yeah, he came back from The Let's Play Show.
00:23:12 And I've told this story a million times, but I'm sure somebody doesn't know it.
00:23:16 But the gist is, me and Biggs did a YouTube Let's Play channel for about two years.
00:23:22 Then I started making the anime reviews just because I was bored and I thought it'd be funny.
00:23:27 And so the first one was Girls Bravo.
00:23:29 And then like seven months later came The Death Note 1.
00:23:32 And then five months later came The Yamada 1.
00:23:35 And then like half a year after that is when the Yamada video went viral for the first time.
00:23:40 Got a shit ton of views and I was like, okay, okay, finally something. People like it.
00:23:45 Wait, which channel was this all on?
00:23:46 This is on The Monkey and Biggs Show.
00:23:48 Okay, so the original post of Monkey and Biggs Show,
00:23:51 which was mostly a Let's Play channel that just had a few anime reviews spliced in?
00:23:55 Yeah, yeah.
00:23:56 Okay.
00:23:57 So at that point we got a bunch of subscribers on The Monkey and Biggs Show,
00:24:00 but I knew, well, when we upload more Let's Plays, they're gonna leave.
00:24:04 They don't want to watch this shit.
00:24:05 Right.
00:24:06 So I made a new channel called Monkey's Anime Reviews.
00:24:08 And that's where that's where that started.
00:24:10 And I started making anime reviews on the weekly.
00:24:13 So how much did the Yamada video blow up on The Monkey and Biggs Show?
00:24:17 What view count were we talking?
00:24:19 Like 400,000.
00:24:20 Oh my god.
00:24:21 Yeah.
00:24:22 So huge.
00:24:23 Huge.
00:24:24 So you can imagine my sadness when Biggs makes the decision to delete the channel
00:24:30 without like asking me or, you know, he could have just quit being on it.
00:24:35 But no, he had to delete it.
00:24:36 And YouTube, of course, the great company that they are,
00:24:39 if a channel gets deleted for any reason, they're not gonna give it back to you.
00:24:43 Christ.
00:24:44 So my big viral video gone forever.
00:24:47 Yeah.
00:24:48 That's a serious fucking view count.
00:24:51 400,000.
00:24:52 Yeah.
00:24:53 What was your subscriber total on that channel?
00:24:55 I think it peaked at like 1,000.
00:24:57 Okay.
00:24:58 So the viralness did not attract subscribers because most of the channel was Let's Play.
00:25:03 When they saw it was a Let's Play channel, I imagine they scurried away.
00:25:06 How many, like what was the frequency of uploads of these Let's Plays and what games and stuff?
00:25:10 So this is when I got real serious about doing a schedule.
00:25:15 And for a long time, The Monkey and Big Show, for almost an entire year we had two new videos
00:25:21 a day.
00:25:22 Oh my god.
00:25:23 We had-
00:25:24 Full Game Grumps.
00:25:25 Yeah.
00:25:26 I've heard parts of this story, but I didn't realize that The Monkey and Big Show had been around
00:25:30 for so long and had so many videos.
00:25:32 This was like a serious full blown channel.
00:25:34 Yes.
00:25:35 Why did he delete it?
00:25:36 Yes.
00:25:37 Yes.
00:25:38 That's why it was so devastating.
00:25:39 And you didn't kill him.
00:25:40 I almost did.
00:25:41 I didn't talk to him for a long, long time.
00:25:43 Yeah.
00:25:44 Which I shouldn't have even talked to him ever again, but-
00:25:46 Did he ever like apologize?
00:25:48 Of course not.
00:25:49 Of course fucking not.
00:25:50 Fucking piece of shit.
00:25:51 He still thinks he's justified to this day.
00:25:54 Why did he delete it?
00:25:55 What was his reason?
00:25:56 Because now that we had an audience and like we were averaging about 100 views per Let's
00:26:00 Play episode, I was like, oh yeah, people are actually watching.
00:26:02 So Biggs took it upon himself to actually, because I would edit and upload every single
00:26:07 video.
00:26:08 Right.
00:26:09 And my internet was shit, so it would take me like three hours to upload each video,
00:26:12 living out in the boonies.
00:26:13 So I said, hey Biggs, can you edit these and upload them?
00:26:16 All you have to do is watch them and make sure we don't say each other's names and if we
00:26:19 do, edit it out and then upload it.
00:26:21 He said, oh yeah, I'll do it.
00:26:23 I'll do it.
00:26:24 Three days ago by, he wouldn't upload a video.
00:26:26 So I'd be pestering him in the text.
00:26:27 Yeah, dude, you missed the upload again today.
00:26:29 What's going on?
00:26:30 Oh yeah, I'll do it.
00:26:31 I'll do it.
00:26:32 Doesn't do it.
00:26:33 I keep pestering him.
00:26:34 He's like, oh, oh, fine, fine.
00:26:35 If you think I'm so lazy, I'll just delete it.
00:26:38 What?
00:26:39 It's early enough.
00:26:40 It was gone.
00:26:41 What the fuck?
00:26:42 Yeah, that's the, and that's one of the best friends I've ever had, did you?
00:26:46 One of the best friends I've ever had deleted my viral video.
00:26:51 Yeah.
00:26:52 Biggs, you are a human waste.
00:26:55 Yeah.
00:26:56 I hope you get diabetes and die.
00:26:58 I think he hopes that too.
00:27:00 You're singing him praises as far as he's concerned.
00:27:04 All right, so Monkey and Biggs gets deleted.
00:27:06 Where do we go from here?
00:27:07 So now I still have the Monkey's Anime Reviews channel, which luckily a lot of people had
00:27:12 already switched over to.
00:27:14 But now I have to find a way to get all those views back on the Omni Video, which doesn't
00:27:19 happen for quite a few months, but at some point it does go viral on Reddit again.
00:27:25 So this is the second time.
00:27:26 The same video goes viral and gets on the front page of Reddit.
00:27:29 Unbelievable luck that that happened.
00:27:31 It's happened like three times total.
00:27:33 So it was luck the first time.
00:27:35 I mean, I guess that video is just that good.
00:27:37 I guess so.
00:27:38 I mean, it's a lot like I had a similar experience with my why good anime is hard to make video,
00:27:43 where that one had like went viral when it came out and got up to 300,000 views.
00:27:48 And then a full year later, it just suddenly rocketed up to a million.
00:27:52 And I have no idea why still.
00:27:54 I don't know where you don't know where it was posted.
00:27:56 No idea.
00:27:57 I don't know if it was posted in a place or if it just got caught up because it was around.
00:28:02 It was like I hit 100,000 subscribers.
00:28:04 And right after that happened, like all my videos started getting a lot more views as
00:28:09 a YouTube start.
00:28:10 I think YouTube starts promoting you more once you hit 100K.
00:28:12 I need to hit 100K.
00:28:13 It takes you more seriously as a channel.
00:28:15 And so it starts, it puts you puts you in the algorithm more.
00:28:18 And so that video just caught a second wind and fucking like wildfire blew up the channel.
00:28:23 Yeah.
00:28:24 And I gained like, it was like I hit 100K after like a slow steady buildup.
00:28:29 And then the next 30K in like a week.
00:28:31 God damn.
00:28:32 Well, I hope that happens to me.
00:28:33 I can't wait.
00:28:34 It sounds great.
00:28:35 What were you about to say?
00:28:37 You're continuing your story.
00:28:39 You've got monkeys anime.
00:28:41 Yeah.
00:28:42 Okay.
00:28:43 So it blows up again and I'm ecstatic.
00:28:44 So what kind of blow up are we talking about this time?
00:28:46 I'm getting one new subscriber, I think every 10 seconds.
00:28:50 Jesus.
00:28:51 And this happens for a full night.
00:28:53 So I wake up the next morning and it's like thousands higher than it was when I went to bed.
00:28:57 And it's still growing and growing and growing.
00:28:59 I'm like, oh yeah.
00:29:00 Yeah, this is great.
00:29:01 I got him.
00:29:02 I got him in videos.
00:29:03 How many views does this second Yamada video?
00:29:05 They always end up with like half a million.
00:29:07 Okay.
00:29:08 Yeah.
00:29:09 So three times this video has reached half a million.
00:29:12 And this motherfucker, Flutterbutter, who God bless him because he patroned me at $50 per month for a long time to make up for this.
00:29:18 When he found it the first time, he took my Yamada video and put it on his Facebook account without any link to my YouTube or anything.
00:29:25 So free booted it.
00:29:26 Yeah.
00:29:27 Like who would do such a thing?
00:29:28 Who would just download somebody else's hard work video and upload it further as if they made it?
00:29:35 Like I can't think of a bigger scumbag.
00:29:37 Do you know that term free booting?
00:29:39 No, I mean I can assume what it means.
00:29:42 Well it was coined specifically to refer to the Facebook because there's tons of people who do this who take YouTube videos, re-upload them to Facebook with like the identifier scrubbed off and they go viral there because it's easier on Facebook.
00:29:55 It happened to Jesse with Fuck Up Dates.
00:29:59 That video has a lot of views anyway though.
00:30:01 It has like 100,000 on YouTube.
00:30:03 It has millions on Facebook from people's free booting.
00:30:07 Hey I was going to say my Yamada video on Flutterbutter's Facebook got 2 million views and I, like that, I was flabbergasted.
00:30:16 That's a lot.
00:30:18 Yeah.
00:30:19 I'm imagining all the ad revenue I missed out on.
00:30:21 Uh, $2,000.
00:30:24 The ad revenue you missed out on.
00:30:26 Hey Flutterbutter thanks for I guess the 250 you gave me on Patreon.
00:30:30 Did he make money off of the Facebook?
00:30:32 I have no idea.
00:30:33 I don't care.
00:30:34 I really don't care.
00:30:36 Yeah.
00:30:37 So uh, so you've got, you're now gaining subs on Monkey's Anime reviews.
00:30:42 At this point, my channel, so my channel has two strikes on it.
00:30:47 Because I made a review of Boku No Pico where I did, I made no effort to censor anything.
00:30:52 Yeah.
00:30:53 Because I thought that the anime having a pixelated penis was enough censorship.
00:30:56 No.
00:30:57 Not even close.
00:30:58 So that's strike number one.
00:31:00 Strike number two.
00:31:01 Not to mention there's like cum everywhere.
00:31:03 Well, I mean, I said in the review that it was like ice cream or something, so I thought it was okay.
00:31:07 Yeah, no.
00:31:08 Not happening.
00:31:09 Uh, so you think I would learn my lesson?
00:31:11 No.
00:31:12 Because then, number two, strike number two, I make Boku No Pico abridged.
00:31:17 Oh no.
00:31:19 Which is currently still uploaded on my Facebook page if you're curious to see it.
00:31:24 Again, that gets, that gets blown the fuck out.
00:31:27 They're like, nope.
00:31:28 Strike two.
00:31:29 Now my channel is blowing up and I think, okay.
00:31:31 These are community guidelines strikes, by the way, which are much harder to beat back than, than, than content ID.
00:31:36 Because they usually, I've had a couple of them on totally innocuous videos that still managed to, I couldn't get them back.
00:31:45 I couldn't beat the claims.
00:31:46 What was there?
00:31:47 What were they saying?
00:31:48 What's wrong with it?
00:31:49 One, one was on a video about a pony ask blog called Ask Princess Milestia.
00:31:54 And there was a huge, like.
00:31:56 Well, I wonder why they took it down.
00:31:58 Well, the thing is, none of the imagery was actually, like, 18 plus or anything.
00:32:03 But this, there was a, this is how I found out about SJWs.
00:32:07 Because there was a huge SJW screed against that blog.
00:32:11 And they got it taken off of Tumblr.
00:32:13 They got Tumblr, a website full of porn, to take down Ask Princess Milestia because they were offended about it.
00:32:20 I think there was an internet aristocrat video about this very thing.
00:32:23 I, I distinctly remember something about that.
00:32:26 But yeah, they got that blog taken down and then they got my video taken down about the blog.
00:32:30 So, and so I got a guideline strike on that, contested it, didn't win.
00:32:34 The next one I got, this one's just utter bullshit, was for a review of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure that there was literally, I have no idea.
00:32:43 I think someone just had it out for me and got a guideline strike on it.
00:32:47 And yeah, it just went down.
00:32:49 And then I think I did beat that one, but it took a while.
00:32:51 And it was just like, yeah, guideline strikes are hard to beat.
00:32:55 They're pain in the ass.
00:32:56 Well, I didn't get an opportunity to try to fight the third one because once you hit strike three, you're out.
00:33:01 You don't even get a chance to say, hey, you know, you took this down wrong.
00:33:05 So when I see him blowing up, I think, okay, I got to make a new video right now to celebrate all these new subs.
00:33:10 So I wanted to make a satirical video mocking how like porn on YouTube and people are always looking for porn on YouTube.
00:33:20 And if you're like, I had it on the Let's Play series that there was, we're doing Mega Man Legends too.
00:33:26 And at the time, each episode had like maybe 20 views, but then there was one that had like kind of a pornographic name and it had like 10 times the views.
00:33:35 So that was my inspiration.
00:33:36 Like, why the fuck it says Mega Man Legends, let's play episode 14, like role hentai or something.
00:33:43 Why does this have so many more views?
00:33:44 Why are these idiots clicking on this?
00:33:46 Why are they searching for this on YouTube?
00:33:48 So the whole video was making fun of kind of that idea.
00:33:51 But I think where I fucked up was that the title of the video to play into the satire was all caps.
00:33:57 Hentai porn, XXX, YouTube naked girls, boobs, blah, blah, blah.
00:34:02 So I think that just hit the computer, the system, they're like, oh, take it down, take it down.
00:34:07 Like there's no way computers don't understand satire, I guess.
00:34:10 So they see that title and they take it down.
00:34:11 It's also that misleading titles are against the YouTube problem.
00:34:14 It wasn't misleading.
00:34:15 It's a satirical thing, right?
00:34:17 I would argue for it.
00:34:18 I would argue against YouTube about that, but you didn't get the chance.
00:34:22 Yeah, I didn't get the chance.
00:34:23 So they take down the video and now I have no YouTube channel, they're all gone.
00:34:26 So when I make the new one, all the old fans have to somehow come back and find me.
00:34:30 Because I don't have a Twitter, I don't have a Facebook or anything at that point.
00:34:33 Or maybe I'd started the Facebook maybe.
00:34:35 But yeah, so I have to pretty much start from scratch again and all the fans have to find me again.
00:34:40 I'm sure there's hundreds, if not thousands of people out there who just forgot about me and never bothered to find me again.
00:34:46 Which is so disappointing and sad.
00:34:49 That's why I keep...
00:34:51 The reason I have so many social media accounts everywhere is for this exact reason.
00:34:55 There's always people who won't...
00:34:57 I mean, there's people still who watch all of my main channel videos and somehow don't know about Digiroft or Dark
00:35:05 or the Twitter or something, even though I mentioned it in every video I make.
00:35:10 But there's always someone who's discovering it for the first time.
00:35:13 But for me, it's just, I just need there to be...
00:35:16 It's like one of those ancient demons where as long as one percent of it survives, the rest can grow back.
00:35:23 That's how I feel. As long as there's some people who know who I am, I can grow back.
00:35:28 So if the YouTube channel goes, at least I've got the Twitter guys, they'll follow me to the next channel.
00:35:33 And that channel will grow on its own.
00:35:35 But you were kind of an up shit creak with literally no power.
00:35:38 Had nothing.
00:35:39 So that's when... What is now Monkey Jones 2? That's when I made that channel.
00:35:43 Which was just called Monkey Jones at the time.
00:35:46 Because I dropped the name Monkey's Anime Reviews in favor of Monkey Jones.
00:35:50 I think that's what happened. This is all a blur in my head over the last year.
00:35:54 But then, of course, I start getting strikes on this channel too.
00:35:57 I'm like, fuck it, we're starting over again, boys!
00:35:59 So I make the new Monkey Jones channel, switch the old one to...
00:36:02 It was called Too Damn Monkey as a reference to Filthy Frank's shitpost channel.
00:36:07 And it was called this for a while. When I followed you, it was still called Too Damn Monkey.
00:36:10 It was called that for about half a year, I think, and then I decided, now let's just make it two.
00:36:13 People are too confused by what it means, and I'm tired of explaining it.
00:36:16 And then all the strikes, you know, cleared off, and now I have, you know, all four of these channels.
00:36:22 So this is why if you go all the way back through Monkey Jones 2, some of the Anime Reviews are there.
00:36:26 Yeah.
00:36:27 Some of the early ones.
00:36:28 But I made the new channel, I just reposted all of the Anime Reviews again.
00:36:31 I think there were like 10 up to that point.
00:36:34 So the current Monkey's Anime Reviews, Yamada's first time blows up a third time.
00:36:40 Yep.
00:36:41 This video has saved your life countless times.
00:36:44 Because if not for it blowing up again, you would still be in the situation if no one knows where you are.
00:36:48 I'd probably still be at like, you know, 500 subs at this point.
00:36:52 But yeah, it keeps blowing up, and then that gives people opportunities to find other videos that have potential for blowing up.
00:36:58 The Elliot Rodger video has been posted in some subreddits.
00:37:01 The InCells video gets posted to InCells like every week.
00:37:05 That's fucking great.
00:37:07 How do they feel about it?
00:37:09 For the most part, they think it's funny, but they're like, oh, he's misrepresenting this guy.
00:37:13 Oh, of course.
00:37:14 And I'm like, dude, I just took posts from here.
00:37:16 Yeah, literal quotes from you guys.
00:37:19 But I mean, I did go out of my way to find the funny stuff.
00:37:22 Right, of course.
00:37:24 I mean, I don't know.
00:37:26 The concept alone is hilarious.
00:37:28 And the Corey in the House video has been posted some places because it's my second most viewed video, I think.
00:37:34 Which I think it should be first.
00:37:35 I think it's way better than Yamada.
00:37:37 But I just have a personal preference for Elliot Rodger stuff.
00:37:41 I think the Yamada one is...
00:37:44 It's one of my favorites on your channel just because it's got that...
00:37:48 It's such a clear line.
00:37:50 You know, there's no...
00:37:52 Like most of your videos, they go in a lot of different directions.
00:37:56 Yamada is just one tension build the whole way through.
00:37:59 It just starts off seeming one way, then it starts to lean.
00:38:02 It just keeps leaning further and further until it just falls right off a cliff.
00:38:07 And that's what's so great about it.
00:38:09 And people say, why don't you make more videos like Yamada?
00:38:12 You need to keep making...
00:38:14 This is the video everybody likes, but I feel like I can't.
00:38:17 No, it's not duplicatable.
00:38:19 No, you can't.
00:38:20 And it'll be so obvious that he's just doing Yamada again.
00:38:23 You can't please these fucking idiots.
00:38:25 Well, that's what people don't under...
00:38:27 People who aren't creative don't understand that like...
00:38:30 You can't just make Yamada again.
00:38:31 Yeah, you can't just fucking recreate the same thing.
00:38:34 And it's going to be obvious and it's never going to top it.
00:38:38 Because now everybody's expecting it, so the joke doesn't work.
00:38:41 If it was already...
00:38:43 It'd be one thing if you made a video that wasn't super successful,
00:38:47 it was a good idea, and then you iterated on that and made a better version.
00:38:51 But if it was already a huge success, there's no topping it.
00:38:55 There's no surprise anymore.
00:38:57 Yeah, like we already have the Yamada video.
00:38:59 It's already done the rounds.
00:39:01 Several rounds.
00:39:03 Now it's time for something else to do the rounds.
00:39:05 Can I find another video that is not the same, but will also become a huge hit?
00:39:12 Oh, Jesus.
00:39:16 Alright.
00:39:17 That about capitalizing your whole YouTube history.
00:39:19 Do you have any other channels we should know about?
00:39:21 I mean, we've got the new gaming channel.
00:39:24 Yeah, yeah.
00:39:25 So, well, that's another sad tale of a co-host that didn't work.
00:39:29 But it started off as a monkey and an animal's gaming expedition.
00:39:33 And I tested the waters on the main Monkey Jones channel with my fire red Nuzlocke Let's Play.
00:39:39 And, you know, a fair number of people have liked it.
00:39:42 So I said, okay, I'll do a separate channel so that your feed...
00:39:45 Most people just want the anime reviews.
00:39:47 Let's not clog up their feed with three times a week of Pokemon Let's Play.
00:39:51 I'll do a new channel with it.
00:39:52 And my buddy, Manimal, he's been wanting to do video game review videos for years.
00:39:58 And he keeps talking about how he's going to start his own video game review channel.
00:40:02 I said, dude, you can join up with me.
00:40:05 We're like best buds at this point.
00:40:07 I'll give you a free audience of a thousand people.
00:40:11 This great opportunity that most new content creators don't get.
00:40:15 You can just... I'll give you my audience.
00:40:18 You have the exact mindset I do, Monkey.
00:40:20 That's what I've told so many of Victor or other friends of mine, where I'm just like...
00:40:25 You don't understand that if you make anything and I like it and I can promote it, you're in the door.
00:40:32 You know, like a shade as a music producer.
00:40:35 He's made hundreds of dollars just because he makes beats for me and I'm already famous.
00:40:40 So people will buy my album because I'm Digi Bro.
00:40:43 It's like shade, all you have to do is make...
00:40:46 No other musician gets this opportunity to just make money just because you're tied to this other guy.
00:40:53 But it's totally worth it because you can launch a career out of it.
00:40:56 If people like your beats, they're going to want to hire you to do more.
00:41:00 I've been trying to convince Victor for years to become a YouTuber.
00:41:04 He just doesn't have a good idea for what he wants to do with it.
00:41:07 Isn't it weird how frustrating it is that nobody wants to take advantage of you?
00:41:13 I don't say that with any irony or anything.
00:41:16 I want my friends to take advantage of me so that they can be making things with me.
00:41:20 You know, Cob always wanted to make videos with me. He made a lot of videos with me back in the day.
00:41:24 Cob, hey, I got 10,000 subs. Let's make some stuff together. People will watch it.
00:41:30 I don't know.
00:41:32 Part of the problem is that it's so hard to convince people that it can take off.
00:41:37 For instance, on DigiBros, it's a Let's Play channel that for a very long time we didn't take seriously at all.
00:41:46 It was just for fun and I would have my friends and stuff on there.
00:41:50 I would always be like, you know guys, if we want to take this seriously, this channel can take off and it can become a job.
00:41:59 But no one would ever do it because they just don't see it.
00:42:01 Even though I'm standing here with a 300,000 subscriber channel going, I know it's possible.
00:42:07 I even know how to do it.
00:42:09 But it's just a matter of convincing people like, hey, I know that this seems like it won't work out
00:42:15 and for a year it's going to seem that way, but eventually it will take off.
00:42:20 I think it revealed to me that there is a very clear distinction between those who are consumers and those who are creators.
00:42:27 And I think it takes a very particular type of person to be an actual creator who has a bit of a work ethic
00:42:34 and actually is motivated to do things.
00:42:36 And I found very quickly that none of my friends meet that criteria.
00:42:41 So I was like, oh man, you want to do this, here's the audience for it, do it, oh yeah, okay.
00:42:47 What you just described is how the procrastinators happened.
00:42:50 Because individually, none of us have friends who will do things.
00:42:56 Ben and Nate are brothers and that's why both of them are, they both work on creative projects,
00:43:04 which is why they're both in the PCP.
00:43:06 We've had times where my brother and Hippo's brother were both in there.
00:43:10 We've had them in the chat before, but they never posted or anything and they never made anything.
00:43:15 So they're very talented, either one of them could launch a YouTube channel.
00:43:19 They just didn't have good ideas for it.
00:43:22 And all my other friends, I would try to get them involved in every video all the time.
00:43:27 I always wanted them in less place.
00:43:28 That's been the last year of my life.
00:43:29 I would always want to do skits, no one ever wanted to do skits.
00:43:32 It's so frustrating.
00:43:34 It's really difficult because you're just, it's like you can see the successful version of it.
00:43:40 You can picture in your mind, guys, if you just, if you just for one afternoon,
00:43:45 decide you want to just like stop sitting around being ironic hipsters about everything
00:43:50 and work on a video and take it seriously.
00:43:54 There's a chance this video could set us all up with careers, you know,
00:43:59 but no one will do it because they can't picture it the way that you can.
00:44:02 And the thing that makes me the most angry is that these fuckers are all talk.
00:44:07 They're all bark and no bite because they would spend, you know, the years before I was monkey,
00:44:12 we would just sit around and they'd talk about how they want to make all these things.
00:44:15 And now that I'm actually doing it and they have the opportunity to join me,
00:44:19 suddenly now they don't want to.
00:44:21 And I'd rather just play Call of Duty again tonight.
00:44:24 Where the fuck was the cop from three years ago who was making videos with me every fucking weekend?
00:44:30 Now that we have success you give up, that doesn't make any fucking sense.
00:44:34 It's just people become complacent because at some point, as a creative minded person,
00:44:41 I think there's a definitive moment when it sinks in, I'm not built for this.
00:44:46 You know, and it's like, it's when, I think maybe it's because you got successful that they realize.
00:44:51 I sense a lot of resentment about it.
00:44:53 I think it was a lot of jealousy and that might sound conceited,
00:44:56 but I feel like a lot of them felt that way like, oh, monkey doesn't deserve it.
00:45:00 I do. I'm grumble, grumble. I don't want to eat off of his success.
00:45:04 I do.
00:45:05 I mean, my friends weren't quite like that, but I definitely think that it was when I started,
00:45:11 I started really making it that it, when one person makes it, it makes everyone else assess
00:45:17 what's the difference between me and them.
00:45:19 And then that's when they realize maybe I can't do it.
00:45:22 Like when they realize that you were doing work every week
00:45:26 and that they did not want to do that work every week
00:45:29 or like once they understood what the work would be
00:45:32 and that they didn't want to do that work, you know?
00:45:35 They decided, you know, maybe I'm better just as a consumer.
00:45:37 Right.
00:45:38 Not as a creator.
00:45:39 I mean, that's why I never became a filmmaker because before I did YouTube for years,
00:45:44 I wanted to be a film director.
00:45:46 Me and my cousin Boyd and my brother Victor.
00:45:48 Well, the thing is that like we got all the material, we had a camera, we had, you know,
00:45:53 I'd listened to all these Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez talking about like,
00:45:58 just pick up your camera and go outside and film stuff.
00:46:00 I didn't go to film school.
00:46:01 I went to films.
00:46:02 Yeah.
00:46:03 Well, there was one quote in particular where Tarantino says,
00:46:06 spend your whole, like every day when you come home from work, work on a script.
00:46:10 And then on the weekend, shoot that script.
00:46:13 That's how you become a great filmmaker.
00:46:15 And I was like, that makes perfect sense.
00:46:17 That's obviously what you have to do.
00:46:19 But if you come home from work and you don't want to write a script
00:46:22 and this keeps happening and you keep telling yourself you'll do it eventually,
00:46:26 at some point you have to say, well, this obviously is something I'm never going to do.
00:46:30 And I think that might be, you know, what happened to my cousin
00:46:33 because he for a very long time was saying he was going to be a director.
00:46:36 And then at some point he just stopped bringing it up, you know,
00:46:38 because I think he realized, well, I'm not doing it.
00:46:41 So I'm obviously not doing it.
00:46:43 Whereas Victor is now doing it.
00:46:46 Yeah.
00:46:47 And I mean, I feel the same way as my cousin.
00:46:50 I gave up at some point I realized I like, like,
00:46:53 how about instead of forcing myself to try to make films,
00:46:56 which I'm obviously not doing,
00:46:58 I could look at this thing that I do every day for no reason,
00:47:01 which is right about anime and try to make a career out of that, you know.
00:47:05 Yeah.
00:47:06 Yeah, I guess there are some things that you're just more pre pre built for doing
00:47:10 and you should figure that out.
00:47:12 Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is that Manimal was super excited about making these reviews
00:47:17 and then he never did.
00:47:18 But we we did want it.
00:47:20 He was very adamant that it shouldn't be just a let's play channel
00:47:23 because he looks down on that.
00:47:24 I used to as well.
00:47:26 But now, now that I know, like,
00:47:29 I think everybody does until they do it.
00:47:31 Right.
00:47:32 It's not because I realize podcasts.
00:47:33 It's not because I realize all this is easy and easy video,
00:47:36 but because like it does mean something to a lot of the audience to have like every day.
00:47:41 Here's my 15 minute video where I hear these people who I like talking about.
00:47:44 If you're if you're fucking entertaining enough that people will watch it,
00:47:48 you've earned it, you know.
00:47:49 Yeah, that's true.
00:47:50 Like people people can shit all day on like the Game Grumps, for instance.
00:47:54 And I mean, I don't think they're funny anymore.
00:47:56 But like the idea of being as funny as they are as consistently as they were
00:48:02 for a fucking year with two uploads a day, 20 minutes a day of you being funny.
00:48:07 You know, that's 20 minutes of improv comedy coming out every single day.
00:48:11 Like in the game does not carry it.
00:48:13 Like people watch Game Grumps for them.
00:48:15 People don't care about the video games they're playing.
00:48:17 I can't remember the last time I watched the Game Grumps without it being open in a different tab.
00:48:22 Yeah.
00:48:23 I just listen to them talk.
00:48:24 I mean, if sometimes it's a game they're more reactive to you will.
00:48:27 But like, you know, if you're watching like Pokemon, you know, look at that.
00:48:30 Yeah.
00:48:31 Open it up in a new tab, sit around, listen to it all day, you know, or,
00:48:34 or just have it on like when I binge watched the entire Dan era, I just had it.
00:48:40 Fuck.
00:48:41 I just had it full screen.
00:48:42 Was that like a year and a half at that point?
00:48:45 Yeah, it was close to two years.
00:48:47 That's a lot.
00:48:48 Yeah.
00:48:49 And I hadn't seen any of it because I'd quit after John left.
00:48:52 That's fair.
00:48:53 And so I caught up on all of it in the span of a couple of weeks after my,
00:48:55 it was when my channel got deleted by YouTube.
00:48:58 So I was depressed.
00:48:59 So I just laid on like the couch and watched and just binged it for fucking two weeks.
00:49:05 And was it a good two weeks or a bad two weeks?
00:49:09 Well, I mean,
00:49:11 Gingrumps numbed me to the crushing pain that I was feeling outside of watching Game Grumps.
00:49:16 Now, did, did you dislike Dan at first or like, did he grow on you?
00:49:19 Or are we always the same?
00:49:21 Um, he definitely grew on me in this.
00:49:24 I don't think I disliked him.
00:49:25 It was just that the breakup was so traumatizing.
00:49:28 And it was so out of nowhere.
00:49:30 Yeah.
00:49:31 And then that Dan sounded a lot like he, his voice was too similar to Aaron and he wasn't
00:49:36 confrontational in the way that they've been before.
00:49:38 It just didn't have the same chemistry.
00:49:40 And suddenly he was half the channel because he was on both steam train and Game Grumps.
00:49:45 Well, and I found steam train insufferable and I still do.
00:49:47 I've never been able to sit through a whole episode.
00:49:49 Is it because of Ross?
00:49:51 Yeah.
00:49:52 I mean, it's, it's that, uh, like Ross and Barry can be funny, but just not on that show.
00:50:00 Like they can't be funny as, uh, as guys playing video games.
00:50:05 Yeah.
00:50:06 I, I like Barry probably 30 times more than I like Ross.
00:50:09 I think Barry is pretty cool.
00:50:10 I think, I think both of that.
00:50:12 Like if you listen to like Ross and Aaron talk about animation, like that one, uh, let's draw that they did.
00:50:17 It was like 50 minutes of them just discussing animation.
00:50:20 Ross comes off as like a cool and interesting guy.
00:50:23 Um, but when he's trying to be like funny and off the cuff, he just comes off as an obnoxious fucking boy.
00:50:29 Uh, and then Barry is just, uh, too normie.
00:50:32 I think he's just not a comedian.
00:50:33 He doesn't have like the comedy chops.
00:50:35 He's a good editor and he's, you know, he can write a good script, but not a good, uh, anyway, we're, we're off in the weeds.
00:50:42 Yeah.
00:50:43 So he, Manimal didn't want it to be a standard Let's Play channel.
00:50:46 He wanted us to put in a whole bunch of work.
00:50:48 He wanted all the boring parts to be cut out, which for a long time we did.
00:50:52 I think the first game we did was his, one of his favorite games, Shadow Run.
00:50:56 Was it the first?
00:50:57 Yeah.
00:50:58 And like those are heavily edited.
00:50:59 There's always shit getting cut out all the time.
00:51:01 Yeah.
00:51:02 He also wanted us to do skits and stuff.
00:51:04 And those almost, almost primarily or almost exclusively came up in the Nuzlocs.
00:51:11 Like the FireRed Nuzlocke had some fun live action skits with Manimal.
00:51:14 And then, uh, I don't know.
00:51:17 We did some other things.
00:51:19 Which the live action skits in the FireRed playthrough are legendary.
00:51:23 That's some of my favorite parts of your whole channel.
00:51:26 Just him running shirtless through the woods in like this weird junk pile.
00:51:31 That's out there.
00:51:32 Yeah.
00:51:33 Going like, beef jerky.
00:51:35 Need food.
00:51:36 And then like, doesn't he tear his shirt off in one of them?
00:51:39 He does that all the time.
00:51:40 Yeah, he tears his shirt off.
00:51:41 There's a part where he's, he's like running around your house and there's just like a sink full of beef jerky.
00:51:47 And he just like sees it and just starts eating it.
00:51:50 Like eating out of the trash and shit.
00:51:52 And then he like suplexes you or something at one point.
00:51:54 Yeah.
00:51:55 And then at the end when he's leaving, he like steals my garbage can because he loves garbage.
00:51:58 Yeah.
00:51:59 And he runs off with it.
00:52:00 That's my, that's one of my favorite like skits ever in a video.
00:52:05 It's the whole Manimal.
00:52:06 That's why I was so sad that Manimal's not around anymore.
00:52:09 Yeah.
00:52:10 So he wanted to do all these skits and to highly polish these Let's Plays.
00:52:14 And then he also wanted to start his big game analysis thing.
00:52:17 But then none of it happened.
00:52:18 He's like, hey Manimal, you want to come over and record some skits for a video?
00:52:22 Oh no.
00:52:23 Okay.
00:52:24 When he's over, when he's over and recording a Let's Play, hey, we should do a skit for this.
00:52:27 No, I don't want to.
00:52:28 Hey Manimal.
00:52:29 You said you're going to do a Nuzlocke.
00:52:30 How's that coming?
00:52:31 Oh, I'm working on it.
00:52:32 Yeah.
00:52:33 So I'm starting to realize, oh, he doesn't have it.
00:52:35 Yeah.
00:52:36 He doesn't have it.
00:52:37 Without me, Manimal's nothing.
00:52:40 He's not going to make anything on his own ever.
00:52:42 I mean, I could tell that immediately.
00:52:44 Like I loved him as a skit prop and I thought if he was, if he was serious about like participating,
00:52:51 he would always have been a good guy to have around.
00:52:54 Like it's great to have a cool, strong guy.
00:52:57 To just have one to show off in a video, like a such a great character because as a bunch
00:53:01 of nerds on the internet, I think we all have a certain reverence for big, cool, strong,
00:53:05 beefy men, you know?
00:53:07 Sure.
00:53:08 And like when we...
00:53:09 And to have one who's like your...
00:53:10 Your buddy.
00:53:11 Your soft-hearted best friend.
00:53:12 Yeah, exactly.
00:53:13 Like the idea of having this cool big, which I have a bunch of friends like this.
00:53:17 Most of my friends are way more jacked than me.
00:53:19 Hard to believe.
00:53:20 Hard to believe.
00:53:21 I love, well, because they're all, I'm not jacked at all, they're all jacked.
00:53:24 But I love the idea of like showing off my strong friend, you know?
00:53:29 Getting to say like, hey, you guys all think I'm some, I'm some little nerd.
00:53:33 But look who my friend here, he could kick all your asses, you know?
00:53:36 I finally understand.
00:53:37 Something gratifying about it.
00:53:38 I finally understand why all women want Chad.
00:53:40 Yeah.
00:53:41 Because they want to show off their big manly trophy.
00:53:42 Exactly.
00:53:43 God damn it, we never stood a chance, Reggie.
00:53:45 Yeah.
00:53:46 So, I don't even think...
00:53:48 Like Manable doesn't even qualify.
00:53:50 Manable looks like a bear game.
00:53:53 But he brings out my latent homo lust, for sure.
00:53:58 I just want to be held in those strong arms.
00:54:01 That protective coat of fur he has.
00:54:03 And I'd sleep in it, you know?
00:54:05 But yeah, like, I mean, as I was watching those videos, I was always thinking like,
00:54:09 well, this guy is clearly too normie to be a YouTuber on his own, you know?
00:54:14 We did like a handful of skits.
00:54:16 Cause your comedic chemistry with him is exactly like mine with my friends on Digi and friends.
00:54:21 If you ever watched any of the non-Victor Digi Bros.
00:54:24 No, no I haven't.
00:54:25 Yeah.
00:54:26 There was a series called Digi and Friends, where it would just be me and whatever other friends were around.
00:54:31 We'd usually release...
00:54:32 Digi Bros was also two episodes a day for the first year that it was around.
00:54:36 And it was usually one episode of Digi Bros and one episode of Digi and Friends.
00:54:40 And yeah, I mean, I carried all the conversations.
00:54:43 Of course.
00:54:44 Of course.
00:54:45 Like, it's just how it is.
00:54:47 There was like the meme of Manimals Subway Sandwich, so we did a couple...
00:54:51 Which was great.
00:54:52 We did a couple jokes of like the Subway Sandwich reveal video, but like those skits were super easy to make, so it was no big deal.
00:54:58 But otherwise, he just, he didn't really want to do it.
00:55:01 I really wanted him to join in the Monkey's Anime Reviews lore as a character,
00:55:07 so he was in the B-movie review, and then he was in the Pokemon review.
00:55:11 And after the Pokemon review, after that day, I'd never heard from him again.
00:55:18 He recorded his audio, we recorded the skit in the bathtub and everything,
00:55:22 and then after that day, he never messaged me again or anything.
00:55:26 He just disappeared, and I was like, oh, what happened?
00:55:29 Was I mean to him when we were filming this?
00:55:31 I don't understand at all.
00:55:33 So then after like three months of no contact, I took his name off the channel.
00:55:39 So I was like, well, I guess this is the final thing.
00:55:42 There's no coming back from this.
00:55:43 He's going to notice that the password has changed and that the name has changed.
00:55:47 And now it's just a Monkey's Gaming Expedition, and I haven't talked to him.
00:55:52 I don't know what happened.
00:55:53 You don't think he's dead, do you?
00:55:55 No, no, no.
00:55:56 Because we have mutual friends who he still hangs out with.
00:55:59 It was like, is it my fault?
00:56:01 Like, I didn't message him either, but like, surely if he still wanted to be Adam,
00:56:07 maybe he's thinking the same thing that I am.
00:56:09 But I guess neither of us made the effort for whatever reason.
00:56:13 That's what happens with me and most of my friends.
00:56:16 At some point, neither one of us has contacted each other, and I keep thinking,
00:56:20 should I, but surely if he wanted to hang out, he would have contacted me.
00:56:24 They're probably thinking the same thing about you.
00:56:26 Yeah, but then I'm also like, but that's the thing.
00:56:28 I'm not contacting them because I don't know what we'd hang out and do.
00:56:31 I'm like, well, you know, I don't want to lose this friend,
00:56:33 but at the same time, what the hell do I have them around for?
00:56:37 You know, just to sit around and do nothing.
00:56:39 And it got to the point where maybe he felt like I was using him in some way
00:56:43 because the only times we would ever hang out would be to work on videos
00:56:46 because that's all I ever want to do.
00:56:48 Right.
00:56:49 I think that's why a lot of my friends got married.
00:56:51 It's just what happens.
00:56:52 This job gets into your head.
00:56:54 It like really, I mean, this, what, what, you come over to my house for the weekend.
00:56:58 By the way, this is a live podcast.
00:57:00 If anyone couldn't tell, we're in the same room on the same microphone.
00:57:03 And we're both naked.
00:57:04 Because it's very hot in here.
00:57:06 And the plan was, monkey was like, I'm coming over to your house for this weekend.
00:57:10 Let's record a thousand things.
00:57:13 Yeah, that's all we've been doing.
00:57:14 That's all we've done.
00:57:15 And that's all I want to do.
00:57:16 That's for me, it's the best possible thing.
00:57:18 Yeah.
00:57:19 Like I, like that's, that's why I'm so close with the PCP.
00:57:23 Like we don't, I think there might be a conception of us doing anything other than the PCP together.
00:57:29 And we don't, we hang out in this chat where we either are, I mean, some, we share our random thoughts and stuff.
00:57:36 But like, we get into vicious arguments that are hurtful and personal sometimes.
00:57:40 Yeah, but like, I love you, Jess.
00:57:42 But like most of the, most of the, um, the times that we talk is all for recordings.
00:57:50 We don't do calls.
00:57:51 Random.
00:57:52 No, I hate calls.
00:57:53 At the end of every PCP, as soon as I turn off the recording, I exit the call because I don't want to talk.
00:57:57 I hate it.
00:57:58 I do too.
00:57:59 The only reason Nate hangs out in there is because he's trying to pressure everybody to get their audio before they leave the call.
00:58:03 Yeah, that's fair.
00:58:04 Yeah.
00:58:05 So we don't usually hang out and talk afterwards unless we have like, I don't know, sometimes we do and it can be nice, you know, but like, and sometimes I will orchestrate a podcast just so that we can have a conversation.
00:58:16 Like there's been plenty of podcasts that were recorded just on the basis of I want to talk to my friends.
00:58:22 We did one recently that I threw out.
00:58:25 Yeah.
00:58:27 He just thought it didn't come out well.
00:58:29 And I, I, I kind of agreed.
00:58:31 And I also, the thing is that the conceit of the podcast was just an excuse to talk with friends, you know, and like when it was just me and you at the beginning, I thought that would have made a good podcast.
00:58:39 But once everybody else joined in, I was like, well, this is just a conversation.
00:58:42 Yeah.
00:58:43 I thought this doesn't really need to be public.
00:58:44 This is going crazy.
00:58:45 Yeah.
00:58:46 Um, but that's, that's a thing that happens with us.
00:58:48 And I don't necessarily see that as like a huge negative.
00:58:52 I just really enjoy making stuff and I enjoy having people around who can make stuff with me, which is why I've kind of taken to you so much because you have the same mindset I do.
00:59:01 And you're as prolific as me, which, you know, it's harder for me to work with the other members of the PCP because they're all working on their own stuff.
00:59:08 And they, like if I, if I get Nate to do something else, that's taking away from his videos.
00:59:15 Yeah, it sounds like he doesn't have a lot of time to do his own stuff as it is.
00:59:18 He's already working a full-time job and he's working on the PCP, which it used to be he edited PCP.
00:59:24 And the only reason he stopped is because it was taking too much time away from editing his regularly.
00:59:27 Well, because he would do a lot of editing.
00:59:29 Autisticly go overboard because he cannot just fucking post a video to the internet.
00:59:33 But, uh, but that's why, that's why as soon as I, like, I feel, I feel like me and you have the same mindset about videos, which is it's more important that it's done than that it's perfect.
00:59:42 Sure.
00:59:43 You know, like, you can't watch something if you don't put it up.
00:59:45 Yeah, I don't care much about editing. I don't care much about, like, uh, like making it pretty or, or perfect for everybody.
00:59:51 Because not every video has to be seen by everyone, you know?
00:59:54 I make lots of stuff that I just post on my subreddit and that's it, you know?
00:59:59 Um, or on Pornhub.
01:00:02 Wait, what, what have you posted on Pornhub?
01:00:05 Well, I, uh, I assisted a friend of mine in making a video.
01:00:08 Oh, okay, yeah.
01:00:09 Yeah, I know that Hentai Samurai wasn't you.
01:00:11 No.
01:00:12 But you helped him out.
01:00:13 Yeah.
01:00:14 He's, he's currently, he's not around today because he, he's, uh, he's taking a sabbatical to the porn store.
01:00:22 He's taking a, he's a, he's a, uh, he's an assistant manager at Got It Video.
01:00:27 Wait, it doesn't sabbatical mean he's not working?
01:00:30 For Hentai Samurai, it's a sabbatical from porn, from jacking up.
01:00:35 He takes a vacation to go work at another job.
01:00:37 Basically, he, he goes to work at a porn store to, because as a samurai, he has to-
01:00:42 Samurai!
01:00:43 Yeah.
01:00:44 As a samurai, he has to have a certain level of like countenance.
01:00:46 Like he has to be, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?
01:00:48 Like Bushido?
01:00:49 Like that Bushido code of like, uh, temperance or whatever?
01:00:52 Of jerking off?
01:00:53 Well, basically he's trying to not jerk off and by going to work for eight hours a day
01:00:58 and, but being surrounded by porn, it helps him to build up his, uh, you know-
01:01:03 His chakras.
01:01:04 Yeah.
01:01:05 He ends around at work all day, like fuming, like...
01:01:08 I would imagine that 3D porn would disgust him and he only wants to see Hentai.
01:01:13 Uh, Hentai Samurai is, he's, he loves all porn.
01:01:17 He's a, he's a connoisseur of all times.
01:01:19 He celebrates it.
01:01:20 He celebrates it.
01:01:21 Anyway, I think the point we're trying to make is that these friends of ours feel like they're being used,
01:01:27 whereas in my mind it's, I think we have a fun chemistry, a good friendship,
01:01:31 and I want to share that with the whole world.
01:01:33 Yeah.
01:01:34 And he might feel like, oh, he's just using me to have a co-host on his-
01:01:37 Let's, let's play.
01:01:38 What's so difficult about it is that, like, I, the reason I had all my friends on there is
01:01:42 because I think they're cool people.
01:01:43 Yeah.
01:01:44 You know, I like all these guys.
01:01:45 So it's especially painful when they no longer want to do it or be friends with you.
01:01:49 Yeah.
01:01:50 Like, these are all people I wanted to show off.
01:01:52 My only crime was that I love you.
01:01:53 Yeah.
01:01:54 If you listen to all my videos, you will probably have heard me talking about how much I love
01:01:58 these people a lot.
01:01:59 Like, I always am bragging about them because I think they're cool.
01:02:02 Or if you listen to all the old music I used to force them to do, because that's, that was
01:02:07 also a thing.
01:02:08 I used to have all my friends were musicians, but none of them were, like, willing to actually
01:02:13 make music.
01:02:14 So I would just force them all into a room and have them, like, bullshit improv stuff,
01:02:18 and then I would upload it.
01:02:20 None of them wanted anything to do with it.
01:02:23 But, but I love it, you know, and I still listen to all that stuff.
01:02:26 They probably don't even remember half of it.
01:02:30 So anyway.
01:02:31 So, yeah.
01:02:32 So you've gotten to that.
01:02:33 You are now in the same position I am, falling out with all your friends, trying to get the
01:02:37 hell out of your hometown.
01:02:38 Yeah.
01:02:39 You're moving the hell out.
01:02:40 Yeah.
01:02:41 By the time this is up, I'll probably be moved out.
01:02:43 Oh, I don't know.
01:02:44 This could come out tomorrow.
01:02:45 Yeah.
01:02:46 Well, I'm moving at the end of March.
01:02:48 Okay.
01:02:49 Yeah.
01:02:50 So you're currently visiting North Carolina.
01:02:52 I don't think it's any secret that your girlfriend is sheep over.
01:02:56 No.
01:02:57 Not at this point.
01:02:58 She's sheep over who you, how did you two meet?
01:03:03 I think the first time we talked was on Snapchat.
01:03:06 She sent me a snap and I thought she looked like Murph from Interstellar.
01:03:11 Interstellar?
01:03:12 I was like, oh shit, dude, it's Murph.
01:03:15 Man, she's like this.
01:03:16 She's two of the top ten waifus of all time, dude.
01:03:19 Yeah, she is.
01:03:20 I got to get in with Murph.
01:03:23 And the rest is history.
01:03:25 So yeah, you've always had a very public Snapchat, which I thought that was another
01:03:29 thing that interested me right from the beginning was your willingness to not just have fan
01:03:34 interactions, but to let them get closer to you than I think most people would.
01:03:38 Like Snapchat, I was always afraid to have a public Snapchat because I'm like, I'm going
01:03:42 to get dick pics.
01:03:43 I do every day.
01:03:45 Do you really?
01:03:46 Of course.
01:03:47 I've never gotten one.
01:03:48 I have a public Snapchat now.
01:03:49 I've never gotten a dick pic.
01:03:50 I think your fans respect you.
01:03:52 Well, that was the saddest thing that ever happened, in my opinion, was you opened a
01:03:57 P.O. box.
01:04:00 I know where this is going.
01:04:02 Well, that monkey opened a P.O. box, which I've been meaning to do for a long time, but
01:04:05 I just, I guess I had assumed it was too expensive or too much of a pain in the ass.
01:04:09 How much did you end up paying for it?
01:04:11 60 bucks, I think, for six months.
01:04:14 I did like 100 for a full year.
01:04:16 Yeah, so you opened a P.O. box and when you did that, I was like, well, shit, if monkey
01:04:21 is doing it, I want to do it.
01:04:23 I'm even bigger than him, I'll probably get even more shit.
01:04:26 And you sure did.
01:04:28 Yeah, but the funny part is, because what you got was a bunch of dildos and sex toys, I'm
01:04:34 expecting that.
01:04:36 And it never happened.
01:04:38 Seven months of having a P.O. box, never once did I get any sex stuff or anything weird,
01:04:43 all just love letters.
01:04:45 You get gifts and posters.
01:04:47 There's unbelievably long fucking soliloquies about how my content changed someone's life
01:04:54 and Bubki gets boy pussy aroma handles.
01:04:59 And you'll be putting up a new mailbag once a week and it's like an hour long with just
01:05:03 a constant stream of gifts.
01:05:05 I struggled to make an eight minute episode with three packages, all of which are just
01:05:09 fuck you gifts.
01:05:11 And I wanted to bring that up because I think there's a perception of you that because you
01:05:18 embrace that, that that's what you want more of, but I don't think that's necessarily the
01:05:23 case.
01:05:24 That's a fear that by laughing at it and propping it up, it seems like I'm encouraging it.
01:05:29 Well, that's what I think when Jesse says that he has a different mindset about the
01:05:34 interactions.
01:05:35 I think it's because he thinks you want just that, but you don't.
01:05:38 It's just that's all you're getting.
01:05:40 If it was just that, I mean, I'm not going to complain.
01:05:42 I still think it's funny because in my view, the Internet should be the wild, wild West.
01:05:47 And I think everybody on the Internet should be an asshole all the time, which I know you
01:05:51 all very much disagree with, especially Jess.
01:05:55 But I mean, the Internet in my mind, ever since the beginning of me going on the Internet,
01:06:00 it's been like going on 4chan, going on these cesspools of hatred.
01:06:05 And that's what I love.
01:06:06 And I think that's what the Internet should be about.
01:06:08 You could be nice to each other in person.
01:06:11 That's the human interaction.
01:06:12 The problem with it is that the Internet is real now.
01:06:16 And I think that the people who have the mindset like what you have, there's a lot of people
01:06:20 who don't recognize or won't admit that it's no longer the same people.
01:06:25 There was a time when the Internet was like a closed off place that was just for freaks
01:06:29 and weirdos.
01:06:30 It was like, if you can't make it in normal society, here's a place for you.
01:06:35 But now everyone's on the Internet.
01:06:37 And it's like, now if we're just assholes to each other, then it's no different from
01:06:41 doing it in real life.
01:06:43 And it's like, especially for those of us who don't have anywhere else to go in real life,
01:06:47 it's like, I don't want to go to the place where everyone's an asshole.
01:06:49 I want to give me the hug box.
01:06:51 I need something on here.
01:06:53 Somewhere I can get my hugs.
01:06:56 So I have to assume some people, the appeal of monkey is that it's a corner of the Internet
01:07:01 where almost anything goes, like anything that YouTube won't ban before.
01:07:06 I'll make a video of me saying the word nigger in a rap song.
01:07:10 I mean, you do that all the time, obviously, but that's just one example.
01:07:13 I'll make a video about 9-11 and the Jews and all this stuff because it's the Internet.
01:07:18 I don't care.
01:07:19 Anything should go.
01:07:20 And I want to be the shining example of, oh yeah, on the Internet, anything is possible.
01:07:25 But it seems like you're saying that's dying and now it's becoming a norm.
01:07:29 I think you can keep it alive in that corner.
01:07:32 Which is my goal.
01:07:33 The problem is that we brought you into the PCP and brought your fan base to ours.
01:07:39 That's your problem.
01:07:40 We mixed them in an unfortunate way.
01:07:44 So now your fans are coming to our channels just to get banned.
01:07:47 I mean, once you ban them, what's the problem after that?
01:07:51 Well, the problem is there's a thousand avenues on the Internet.
01:07:57 But anyways, I understand the desire to keep that alive.
01:08:01 And that's kind of why I still go on 4chan for the same reason.
01:08:06 I like that the Internet can be a place that normal stuff can happen.
01:08:12 And my channel, obviously, I try to preserve meaningful conversation and stuff.
01:08:17 But I don't always want that.
01:08:19 Sometimes I just want to go to 4chan and see the assholes be assholes to each other.
01:08:26 So I totally understand the idea of having it alive.
01:08:29 But would you not say that if fans sent you genuine stuff, you would also be happy with that?
01:08:36 Oh, yeah.
01:08:37 I mean, let's not say that everything I've gotten is bad.
01:08:40 I've gotten some good things.
01:08:42 I think there's been a couple of times where I didn't show it in the video,
01:08:46 but a letter, I actually teared up because it was just so nice.
01:08:51 I think that because of the monkey persona,
01:08:55 there's a lot of people who assume that you would rather get negative comments
01:09:01 and people shitting on you when this is not really the case.
01:09:05 It depends on the type of video.
01:09:07 If the Elliot Rodger review, I would like a serious discussion there.
01:09:11 It's a serious video.
01:09:12 But all these fucking videos about yelling about Jews and stuff,
01:09:16 just shit up the comments.
01:09:18 Let the comments reflect the video.
01:09:20 I think that's fair.
01:09:21 Do you think some of your audience has a difficult time discerning
01:09:24 between when they should be serious or not?
01:09:28 Probably.
01:09:29 I mean, I don't care.
01:09:30 As long as their mean comments are funny, even if they're genuine,
01:09:35 if they're funny, then I still love them because it makes me laugh.
01:09:39 Funny is always the problem.
01:09:42 I think the biggest problem with commenters is that so many of them aren't funny
01:09:45 and think they are.
01:09:46 That's by far my biggest.
01:09:47 I don't even mind.
01:09:48 I've gotten comments that shit on me that were legitimately funny
01:09:52 that I will upvote.
01:09:54 It's not every day.
01:09:55 If you leave a comment that's just like, fuck you, then I'm like, well,
01:09:58 I think that's funny because the lack of effort is funny on its own.
01:10:03 It can be.
01:10:04 But if it's just like someone, because I usually am like, I know why.
01:10:08 It's just some snob fan or something to say fuck you.
01:10:11 I'm just like, yeah, you're banned.
01:10:12 Do you ever get comments where it just says OK and nothing more?
01:10:16 Those do make me laugh.
01:10:17 It's like, why did you post this?
01:10:19 I actually do think those were funny.
01:10:21 What the fuck is this in reference to?
01:10:24 I always get so confused.
01:10:26 I don't know what to do about it.
01:10:27 I'm like, is this a shit post?
01:10:29 What is this?
01:10:31 I love those.
01:10:32 Yeah.
01:10:33 That's the thing.
01:10:34 Fuck you is too unambiguous.
01:10:35 If you're so confounding, like I've had some where they're shitting on me,
01:10:39 but they're just like so incompetent at English that I leave it up
01:10:43 because I feel like they've defeated themselves.
01:10:48 Oh, yeah.
01:10:49 It can be a lot of fun.
01:10:50 If you're still listening, just comment OK on this episode.
01:10:53 Someone probably already did.
01:10:55 Before they even got to this point, it's just that guy who does it.
01:10:58 It probably says OK and then edit dot, dot, dot, shit.
01:11:02 Now they're going to do that on purpose.
01:11:04 You fucked it all up.
01:11:07 Maybe they'll take it another step farther from where we've thought.
01:11:10 Yeah, let's not give them any more freebies.
01:11:13 So you are planning to either before this comes out or right afterwards
01:11:22 to end Mumki's anime review.
01:11:24 Come and do an end, baby.
01:11:26 I'll finally be free.
01:11:27 Yeah.
01:11:28 Episode 50.
01:11:29 I thought I'd go to 100, but I think I've exercised the lore enough.
01:11:35 Mumki can only go through this cycle of knowing that it's all conspiracy
01:11:41 and then thinking it's real and back and forth.
01:11:44 It's already gotten to a point of saturation.
01:11:46 Yeah.
01:11:47 I'm like, OK, well, this needs to end.
01:11:49 I can't stretch this out forever.
01:11:51 Let's end it once and for all.
01:11:53 I'll keep making the exact same style of video,
01:11:55 but we just won't call it Mumki's anime reviews.
01:11:57 And it won't have the narrative with Uncle Alex and Jumki and all that.
01:12:01 Yeah, I know.
01:12:02 All that's going to get retired.
01:12:03 I'll keep Jumki and Alexa as characters,
01:12:06 but it'll be a different canon, maybe.
01:12:09 So, oh, God, I got a burp coming in.
01:12:14 There we go.
01:12:16 Where are you going to go after this, after it's all over?
01:12:19 Do you think you'll ever construct another narrative
01:12:21 or do you think you're done with that whole aspect of it?
01:12:25 I think it was a fun little experiment.
01:12:28 And a lot of people seem to really like it.
01:12:31 But if I don't have a good idea for it, I don't want to do it.
01:12:35 So I'm not going to try to force it.
01:12:37 That's why I've never done one.
01:12:39 The pitfalls that people fall into,
01:12:41 people think, oh, I have to do a narrative.
01:12:44 The Jon Tron has a narrative sometimes and all this shit.
01:12:48 So I have to force it in.
01:12:49 And then that's when they're bad, is when you try to force it.
01:12:51 It has to come naturally with me or with Jess when he does it.
01:12:55 With Jesse, he can't help it.
01:12:57 It's like it's a destructive force in his life
01:13:00 that he can't help but tie narratives into his videos.
01:13:03 And it's hurt his chances of success on YouTube, unfortunately.
01:13:07 It's like the same thing with the triflers,
01:13:09 which I'm sure we'll talk about later
01:13:10 because we have another three hours of this to go.
01:13:12 But people keep saying, oh, you got to write a sequel to the triflers.
01:13:15 I'm thinking, I'd love to.
01:13:17 But if I don't have the good idea, I'm not going to write something that's shit.
01:13:21 I mean, maybe you'll have a good idea in 10 years or something.
01:13:24 Yeah, maybe.
01:13:25 Who knows?
01:13:28 Yeah, and why does everyone...
01:13:30 People are demanding this of you, not thinking about the fact
01:13:32 that it's not like triflers is a New York Times bestseller
01:13:35 and that wasting two years writing a sequel is going to be a huge payoff.
01:13:39 Yeah, they don't seem to understand that writing a book is a huge process.
01:13:43 They think, as far as I know, I wrote the triflers in an afternoon.
01:13:47 And I didn't edit it once.
01:13:49 That's just how they think it just came to be.
01:13:52 They think, just do it again over the weekend.
01:13:54 Now, if I'm not mistaken, the triflers was completed before Monkey's Anime Review started.
01:13:59 Yeah, yeah.
01:14:00 So give me the timetable.
01:14:01 I have to go to the bathroom, but you can talk about the timetable of how the triflers came to be.
01:14:05 Okay.
01:14:06 The initial idea for it of this group of kids in a basement who watched horrible videos,
01:14:13 it came to me, I think, my senior year of high school.
01:14:17 And I kind of played around with it for a bit.
01:14:19 And then my freshman year of college, I completed another book I was working on,
01:14:25 which I have not released or anything.
01:14:27 I think the only person who's read it other than my grandma and mom are sheep over and Tom Oliver.
01:14:35 So then after I finished that book, I said, okay, let's see what we got with this triflers thing.
01:14:40 So I worked on that.
01:14:42 It took about a year and a half, maybe two years.
01:14:45 I think I finished it my junior year of college.
01:14:49 And then that's about when I started the Let's Plays, I think.
01:14:55 I think that timetable makes sense.
01:14:56 Maybe it was a little bit before.
01:14:58 But yeah, then I started doing Monkey.
01:15:00 I forget about the book for about a year.
01:15:02 I do Monkey for about a full year.
01:15:05 And then as I go, hey, maybe I could polish up this book and people will buy it.
01:15:10 Because there are a few anime reviews where I just took straight pages from the triflers and that's the whole review.
01:15:18 The Traps review is straight from the book.
01:15:21 The Depression review is straight from the book.
01:15:24 And people like those videos.
01:15:25 So I thought, well, maybe they'll like this book.
01:15:27 And they did.
01:15:28 They overwhelmingly did.
01:15:30 So it all worked out.
01:15:31 Have you had any particularly negative reviews of the triflers?
01:15:34 No.
01:15:35 No, I'm astonished by it.
01:15:37 Not one person said this book was not good.
01:15:39 Nobody's given it lower than like a four out of five.
01:15:42 Which I have to assume if they bought it in the first place, they were already interested and they were already a fan.
01:15:47 So I don't know.
01:15:49 I mean, I was just like, to me, the fact that the book even has like competent pros is enough for it to be like, oh, this is a 10 out of 10.
01:15:58 Like, you know, most of the stuff I get sent by people who are like on the internet who are like, yeah, I'm writing a book.
01:16:06 And then they send it to me.
01:16:07 And within two sentences, I'm sick of it.
01:16:09 You know, like most people just.
01:16:12 Writing is hard.
01:16:13 Yeah.
01:16:14 It's hard.
01:16:15 But if a lot of people just think they can't do it, like they just can't do it.
01:16:20 Right.
01:16:21 And like most of the problems I have with your book were more like, like, like high level problems.
01:16:26 Like it's like, like small structural things and nitpicks.
01:16:30 And like maybe this word would have been better in this sentence.
01:16:33 You are sweating up a storm.
01:16:35 I'm noticing.
01:16:36 You mean?
01:16:37 Yeah, you look like you're sweating up a storm.
01:16:38 It's hot in here.
01:16:39 Yeah.
01:16:40 It's a little, it's a little, a little warm.
01:16:41 I get heated when I think about books.
01:16:43 Yeah.
01:16:44 Very passionate.
01:16:45 I guess so.
01:16:46 I didn't notice until just now.
01:16:47 I guess the sun got brighter.
01:16:49 Yeah.
01:16:50 I want to close that goddamn curtain.
01:16:51 I can do that.
01:16:52 I don't know if that'll make it cooler in here, but fuck the sun.
01:16:56 So, so yeah.
01:16:58 So you, you finally put out this book.
01:17:00 So your other one, which is a little shorter.
01:17:02 Yeah.
01:17:03 You, you're thinking, still not thinking about releasing?
01:17:06 Maybe.
01:17:07 I think there are some major things I need to change about it.
01:17:10 If you thought that there was too much sexual stuff with, with minors and the triflers.
01:17:15 Boy, howdy.
01:17:16 This book's going to get me arrested for sure.
01:17:18 So I think I need to achieve over, you know what I'm talking about.
01:17:21 Yeah.
01:17:22 I don't think anybody, Tom, I asked Tom about the specific chapters and chapter five, just
01:17:29 the most gruesome thing I've ever written in my life.
01:17:31 And I asked him what he thought of it.
01:17:33 And he's like, Oh, well, I mean, I'm so used to this kind of stuff.
01:17:36 Thanks to the internet.
01:17:37 That didn't really bother me, but everybody else was like traumatized.
01:17:39 My mom, grandma, and sheep over.
01:17:41 That's the thing.
01:17:42 They're, I mean, if you, if you're, your stuff is like for internet people, I think, like
01:17:47 this is when I read the triflers, my impression of it was like, this is the most millennial
01:17:52 book ever written.
01:17:53 Whoa, wait, it's a bad thing.
01:17:55 No, I'm a millennial.
01:17:57 I understand it.
01:17:58 I wanted to give you this quote.
01:18:01 Keep forgetting to mention this to you, but a few years back, back when I was, I guess
01:18:06 probably five or six years ago, when I was trying to become a writer before this whole
01:18:10 YouTube thing.
01:18:11 I'm a writer.
01:18:12 I'm a writer.
01:18:13 I've been saying that a lot lately and completely meaning it.
01:18:19 But when I was trying to be a writer as opposed to a YouTuber, there was a party going on at
01:18:26 my house with my parents, all their friends and stuff.
01:18:29 And one of my mom or dad's friends who works with them was like sloshed.
01:18:33 She's probably late 30s, early 40s, got kids who were in high school kind of thing.
01:18:39 And she was like drunkenly telling me that what, what she wants, like what I should write
01:18:45 about is like all the illicit stuff that, that high school kids are getting up to like,
01:18:49 hey, all the young kids, like tell me about like all the, all the, the drugs and sex life.
01:18:54 And I was like, I was never, I wasn't a part of any of that.
01:18:57 Like why would I know this story?
01:18:58 Like I only am good at writing what I know, which is about being.
01:19:01 You should only write what you know.
01:19:02 Right.
01:19:03 Well, the way I saw it, I was like, what the kids are up to these days is not all that
01:19:09 stuff.
01:19:10 They're up to being isolated in their rooms at computers.
01:19:13 But then when I read the triflers, I was like, this is exactly what that woman wanted.
01:19:17 This is exactly what she wanted is the seedy, fucked up shit that young people are getting
01:19:22 up to in high school.
01:19:23 You know, I mean, granted that probably went a little further than she could have handled
01:19:27 a lot further.
01:19:28 I imagine.
01:19:29 Yeah.
01:19:30 But, but I was like, this is exactly that.
01:19:33 And so I do think it touched on something that a lot of people want, which is, you know,
01:19:38 to, because, because it feels real, like everything in the triflers, aside from the fact that Don
01:19:43 is like a legitimate, like high level, like light Yagami, you know, like schemer.
01:19:49 How'd you know my inspiration?
01:19:52 Aside from that, like everything in it felt like, yeah, this is the kids I knew in high
01:19:57 school.
01:19:58 Like this is the kind of shit they, the edgy shit they would have got up to, you know,
01:20:02 sitting around a basement watching live leak videos and stuff.
01:20:05 You did have a friend who planned a school shooting.
01:20:07 Good old Phillip.
01:20:08 Yeah.
01:20:09 Good old Phillip Bay was going to do it.
01:20:11 Not just playing.
01:20:12 He had the weapons and everything.
01:20:13 He was ready.
01:20:14 He's a regular Mario Quintanilla.
01:20:17 I think he was busted because he had posted stuff online and people found it.
01:20:22 He pulled an Elliot Roger.
01:20:24 Yeah.
01:20:25 But except he actually got caught unlike Elliot.
01:20:28 I don't, I think he was before, yeah, he was before Elliot.
01:20:31 His attempt.
01:20:32 He was, he was post Virginia Tech.
01:20:34 I think that was more his inspiration.
01:20:36 I could have done a whole 30 minute review of your friend, Phillip, if only he would
01:20:40 have gotten away with it.
01:20:42 Yeah.
01:20:44 All right.
01:20:45 Well, so do you have plans to write another book anytime soon?
01:20:48 Do you think that'll happen?
01:20:50 Do you have any ideas for books popping around?
01:20:52 I've been thinking very hard about how I would approach a Triforce sequel.
01:20:56 And I have like vague impressions of what it would be and things that would happen.
01:21:03 But.
01:21:04 Detective novel starring Mason.
01:21:06 That'd be, that'd be a little bit of it.
01:21:09 Yeah.
01:21:10 But like I said, unless I get like a really good idea, I'm not going to even attempt it.
01:21:15 And I, writing a book is hard and it takes a lot of time and I just don't feel like it right now.
01:21:20 Like I just got off the high of this one being released.
01:21:23 Yeah.
01:21:24 If anything, I would polish up and release the one that I wrote before the Triforce.
01:21:29 Well, I'm really curious about where, where your heart sort of resides in regards to content
01:21:34 right now because you've mentioned that YouTube has become a little bit too formulaic
01:21:39 and you're kind of sick of it in a way.
01:21:42 I think I was just getting sick of the anime reviews videos.
01:21:46 Yeah.
01:21:47 Because I have, as soon as this ends, I have like three new series in my mind that I really,
01:21:52 I'm really excited to do them.
01:21:53 Okay.
01:21:54 One of which is, I think what I'm calling it is the tenisms where I take ten words that
01:21:59 end in ism and I just dissect them and I go through them for like 10 to 15 minutes.
01:22:03 So things like communism, autism, atheism, et cetera.
01:22:08 So I'm really excited about that.
01:22:09 It's like the same style as the anime reviews without the old joke that atheism is a Japanese
01:22:15 anime.
01:22:16 Yeah.
01:22:17 We get it, monkey.
01:22:18 You've done it 50 times.
01:22:20 Let's move on.
01:22:22 So you've got, you've got some, some more YouTube stuff planned.
01:22:25 Yeah.
01:22:26 Lots more Let's Place planned.
01:22:28 Once I move in with Sheep and I, I hopefully.
01:22:31 Is Sheep going to become a co-host?
01:22:33 No.
01:22:34 No.
01:22:35 I hope not.
01:22:36 I don't think either one of us want that, but hopefully I'll be able to film more often
01:22:40 because I've been having a lot of trouble filming in my current apartment.
01:22:44 Once I have more time, I want to, I bought Mario Maker for the 3DS.
01:22:48 I want to play the fuck out of that because I think it's fun as shit and some other things.
01:22:53 So.
01:22:54 Leaving aside the, the anime reviews, you do plan to continue the monkey character.
01:23:00 Yeah.
01:23:01 But, but without the surrounding narrative.
01:23:03 So will he still be making reference to being molested or anything?
01:23:06 Or is it just like a screaming monkey?
01:23:08 I'm putting Uncle Alex to bed.
01:23:10 We've had enough.
01:23:11 So.
01:23:12 It's only so far you can go with that joke.
01:23:14 Yeah.
01:23:15 But you're still going to be like a, like a, like a gravelly voiced monkey man.
01:23:20 I'm still, I'm still going to be myself.
01:23:22 And the mask is staying on.
01:23:24 Uh, yeah.
01:23:25 Yeah.
01:23:26 Yeah.
01:23:27 We'll see how often I do live action.
01:23:29 Right.
01:23:30 Cause that's always, it's, it's hit or miss and it's also a lot of effort.
01:23:34 Do you think there's a chance that the mask is going to come off at some point just be,
01:23:38 just to be able to, she's giving me a look like, yeah, it's happening.
01:23:42 Like there's no way he's keeping this up forever.
01:23:44 I think if, if I get more handsome.
01:23:46 Cause I figured the same thing, the fact that you're not bad looking at all.
01:23:50 No.
01:23:51 You, I.
01:23:52 I hate it.
01:23:53 When I said, I asked the monkey, like, uh, like why he wears the mask or he, he said,
01:23:58 he was telling me that he was trying to become a teacher.
01:24:00 And I said, is that why you wear the mask?
01:24:02 And he said, no, horrible acne scarring.
01:24:04 So I expected you to be like legitimately ugly.
01:24:08 And look, look, monkey, I'll tell you right now.
01:24:11 I, I cannot look ugly people's directly in the face.
01:24:17 I'm not joking about that.
01:24:19 If you, is that why you look away when Ben comes in the room?
01:24:22 Shit.
01:24:23 That's not true.
01:24:24 But we're learning.
01:24:25 But when, when, uh, if I thought, if I didn't think that you had a face that I could look
01:24:30 at, I wouldn't, I would be looking off into the distance the whole time we were talking.
01:24:34 I guarantee it.
01:24:35 So, um, I'm, I'm, I'm not, I'm not even kidding about that.
01:24:38 I'm a terrible person.
01:24:39 Let me tell you this, Digi.
01:24:41 The day I, cause I'm only here visiting sheep for 10 days and then I'm going home for a week
01:24:46 and then I'm moving on into North Carolina.
01:24:49 For the day I get back, big brother, the TV show is doing a casting call in my city,
01:24:55 like, like a few blocks from my house and I'm going to go fucking apply.
01:25:00 And if I get on big brother, like this is all out.
01:25:03 My, my face is going to be out there.
01:25:05 My everything about me will be out there.
01:25:07 And my life will probably be ruined because after, you know, you get exposed as
01:25:11 mumke on national television.
01:25:12 I don't think you get a job after that.
01:25:14 No, but I want to be on big brother so bad that I'll throw away any semblance of a future
01:25:19 at that chance for $500,000 and then after taxes, like $8.
01:25:24 I mean, I've, I, I don't know if you feel similarly to me at all because like you,
01:25:31 you're just now sort of taking the internet personality thing more as like a career.
01:25:38 And even then you're planning to get a normal job when you move to North Carolina.
01:25:41 Yeah, I fucking hope I do.
01:25:43 Yeah.
01:25:44 Cause like for me, the second I started making money off of YouTube, the prospect of ever doing
01:25:49 a normal job again was just gone.
01:25:51 Like I never thought about it and never looked back.
01:25:53 Like the only reason I never get a new normal job is if like for some reason I couldn't
01:25:58 do the internet at all.
01:26:00 Like, but I don't feel like that'll ever happen.
01:26:03 Like why, what would ever stop me, you know?
01:26:05 So like for me, it was like, well, you know, it doesn't matter what I say online now
01:26:11 because this is who I am now.
01:26:12 And then like, that's why I'm so willing to go around saying nigger on podcasts and writing
01:26:18 songs about it.
01:26:19 It's just like, this is, this is who I am now and fuck the old, the old me.
01:26:23 So do you think you'll ever reach a point like that where it'll just be like, I'm not
01:26:27 worried about preserving my ability to have a normal life?
01:26:31 Well, I think if I was that serious about that worry, then I wouldn't do the kinds of
01:26:37 videos that I make.
01:26:39 I make things that are highly offensive in this SJW culture.
01:26:44 I mean, I guess if Donald Trump could become president after what he said, maybe I do stand
01:26:49 a chance.
01:26:50 Yeah, but
01:26:51 You just gotta go to the right places.
01:26:52 Don't move to California.
01:26:54 No.
01:26:55 Stay in the deep South where just find, find an establishment who unironically agrees
01:27:00 with the things you've said in your videos that you're set, you know?
01:27:04 The fear of the job, Lynch mob is very real.
01:27:07 But ultimately, I mean, I feel like I'm at the point of no return already.
01:27:12 Like I've crossed it.
01:27:13 So if it's going to happen, it's going to happen.
01:27:15 Like I've already put these videos out and they're on the internet forever.
01:27:18 Once you put it up once, but the prospect of doing this just as a job and do nothing
01:27:25 else like you do, it's such a new type of job.
01:27:30 And it hasn't been around long enough to know if it's sustainable.
01:27:34 Five years from now, maybe Digi Bro isn't making any money anymore.
01:27:37 Or maybe you're making 20 grand a month.
01:27:41 We have no way of knowing.
01:27:43 That's the scariest thing about it is there's no benefits and there's no insurance.
01:27:48 There's no boss.
01:27:50 Like you work for YouTube who's only out to fuck you.
01:27:54 True.
01:27:55 Like they say they want to help you, but they fuck you at every turn.
01:27:59 Yep.
01:28:00 And you're really relying on like, like if I didn't have Patreon, I would be fucked.
01:28:04 Right.
01:28:05 Like there's a lot of YouTubers who do just rely on ad revenue and sponsorships.
01:28:09 I really wonder how Jon Tron's going to survive his controversy.
01:28:13 Digi he'll be fine.
01:28:14 I'm sure he'll be fine.
01:28:15 But like just like he makes so much like, I mean he'd have to, if he lost all his sponsorships
01:28:20 for the things he says, he'd have to scale back his production, I'd assume.
01:28:24 You know?
01:28:25 That would help his videos a lot.
01:28:26 It would.
01:28:27 He should do that.
01:28:28 But if Jon Tron makes a Patreon, he's making five grand a month minimum.
01:28:32 That's probably true.
01:28:33 So I think he's fine.
01:28:34 Yeah.
01:28:35 But that's the thing.
01:28:36 Like it's an interesting culture because we don't know if Patreon's going to start cannibalizing
01:28:40 itself in the future.
01:28:41 Like that's always been a concern for me is the more people find out about it, the more
01:28:45 spread thin the money gets, you know?
01:28:47 There's going to get to a point where people, like that was a big concern of all of us when
01:28:51 we made the PCP Patreon.
01:28:53 Oh yeah.
01:28:54 Are people going to unpatron one of us to patron the group?
01:28:57 Which I think did happen.
01:28:59 Probably a couple people.
01:29:00 Some people, like, lowered theirs from five to one so that they could throw in a buck
01:29:04 to the PCP.
01:29:05 Yeah.
01:29:06 Which is, like, I mean, that kind of fucks us over in a way.
01:29:11 Yeah.
01:29:12 Because, like-
01:29:13 Definitely does.
01:29:14 Because we're all splitting the money anyway.
01:29:15 So like now instead of Digi getting that two bucks, now he's getting like 20 cents.
01:29:18 Yeah, a problem.
01:29:19 So, like, do you really, do you really like Ben St. that much that you want to take away
01:29:25 $1.80 from Digi so that Ben can get, like, a 20-cent share?
01:29:29 Like, fuck Ben.
01:29:30 Just give the money to us directly.
01:29:32 Don't, I don't know.
01:29:33 But I shouldn't say don't do the PCP Patreon because I get, like, what, 20 bucks a video
01:29:37 off of it?
01:29:38 That's kind of good.
01:29:39 Yeah.
01:29:40 I mean, the way I see it though, and this is why I think you would be able to do it,
01:29:46 like you would be able to make a career out of this, is again because you're so prolific.
01:29:50 Because if you are constantly putting shit out, I see it as you've got a dart board and
01:29:56 you're just, like, throwing dart after dart.
01:29:58 Like, if you spend all your time and money trying to craft the perfect dart before you
01:30:04 throw it and then you miss, you've wasted a lot of time.
01:30:08 Yeah.
01:30:09 You know?
01:30:10 But if you've got, like, 100 cheap darts, all that matters is that it hits the bullseye.
01:30:13 You know?
01:30:14 It doesn't matter what the dart looks like.
01:30:15 If it hits the bullseye, you hit the bullseye and you make all the money, you know?
01:30:19 So, like, I think the fact that, you know, you could just be putting out, like, a bunch
01:30:25 of podcasts, a bunch of Let's Plays, a bunch of other shit, you know?
01:30:28 And, like, something's got to hit eventually, you know?
01:30:32 So, like, for me, you know, if for some reason I can't do anime anymore because they keep
01:30:38 fucking hitting me with copyright strikes every other day.
01:30:41 They're going to keep doing anything.
01:30:42 Like, if I decided, like, hey, the problem here is anime.
01:30:49 Let's just cut anime and go to another thing.
01:30:52 You think you could do that?
01:30:53 I think I could do that easily.
01:30:54 I mean, I cut pony and went to anime and became twice as successful.
01:30:57 Go back to pony.
01:30:58 Three times as successful.
01:30:59 They need a new messiah over there.
01:31:01 The bronies are struggling.
01:31:02 The bronies are dead.
01:31:03 There's no going back there.
01:31:05 They're gone.
01:31:06 MLP probably gets, like, what, 200 posts a day on the 4chan board?
01:31:11 It's the worst board on the whole website.
01:31:13 I hope you know that.
01:31:14 I wouldn't know.
01:31:15 They're the worst board on 4chan.
01:31:18 It should have been what everyone thought it was going to be, which is that everyone,
01:31:22 a repeat of the furry board.
01:31:24 You know about the furry board?
01:31:25 No, no.
01:31:26 Like, 10 years ago, maybe more, 4chan made a furry board, a containment board for the
01:31:32 furry, and then they left it up for one week and then anybody who posted there all got
01:31:38 banned.
01:31:40 It was a carpet ban.
01:31:41 It was all a trap.
01:31:42 Genius.
01:31:43 Even if you go there and troll them, just get fucked.
01:31:45 That's what MLP should have been.
01:31:47 They all deserve it.
01:31:50 That's crazy.
01:31:51 Yeah, and that's what people thought it was when it first came out.
01:31:54 But yeah, I think that you could, because you're so prolific, you could eventually,
01:32:00 and that there's people who, you have a base now.
01:32:03 Like, all you need is a base.
01:32:06 Even if you only have 100 people, if they will continue to post your shit everywhere
01:32:11 and follow you whatever you do and stuff, then there's always somewhere to go.
01:32:15 I think that the hardest part of being a creator on the internet is just establishing
01:32:20 enough of a base that cares deeply enough to follow you to the next thing,
01:32:24 which is kind of what fucked over Tom, that he had a little bit of a base,
01:32:29 but he had already kind of lost most of his followers from Brony Curious by the time he
01:32:33 made Rebel Pixels.
01:32:34 And then Rebel Pixels was like such a different thing.
01:32:38 I still don't even know what that channel is.
01:32:40 I looked at the videos and he was just talking about his computer.
01:32:42 What is this shit?
01:32:43 The idea of it is that it's supposed to be helping creators on the web.
01:32:49 It's supposed to be a guidebook for internet creators kind of thing.
01:32:53 So half of the videos are motivational speeches, and the other half are hardware reviews.
01:32:59 But because he mostly got successful through reviewing tablets,
01:33:04 then he just kept doing tablet reviews, and so it kind of became very focused on that.
01:33:08 But it was just that the subject matter was so different,
01:33:11 and his base was already so broken after his original channel,
01:33:16 that it took a long time for Rebel Pixels to even pick up the steam that it has,
01:33:20 which is over 10,000 subs, so it's not that bad.
01:33:24 Whereas for me, I went from ponies directly into anime.
01:33:29 So anybody, which was probably out of my 70,000 subscribers,
01:33:34 there was maybe 4,000 who cared enough to watch the anime videos.
01:33:38 And it was good and bad.
01:33:40 It's like, oh yay, but really?
01:33:42 I went from averaging 40,000 to 70,000 views of video to averaging 2,000 to 5,000 views of video.
01:33:51 But that's the thing.
01:33:52 That base was there, and they were still sharing the videos,
01:33:55 and they were still watching it just because they liked me,
01:33:57 or they just happened to also be into anime,
01:34:00 and eventually it grew out of that and blew up again.
01:34:03 So that's why I think as long as you have that core audience
01:34:06 who cares enough to follow you to the next thing,
01:34:09 you've always got a second chance if you can capitalize on it.
01:34:12 It makes me think of the tragedy of Ben, Nate, and Hippo,
01:34:17 because I was shocked to learn that they had old pony channels
01:34:20 that had like three times as many views as the ones they have now.
01:34:24 And when they started over, like fucking Gibbente has what, 15,000 subs,
01:34:29 and then poor Hippo is at like eight.
01:34:31 Well, part of the problem there, especially in Nate and Ben's case,
01:34:35 was that they deliberately hid it from their old subscribers.
01:34:38 Why?
01:34:39 Because Nate didn't want to have the baggage of the MLP community,
01:34:43 which in fairness-
01:34:44 They're just people!
01:34:45 In fairness, if you knew these people.
01:34:47 It's a human being, they can like two things.
01:34:50 Right, but he was scared that his audience would end up just being those people
01:34:55 and that a new one wouldn't form around here, whatever.
01:34:58 And so he never, like on the T-Bap channel,
01:35:01 that channel was dead for like a solid year
01:35:04 before Ben finally put up a video telling everyone what they had done,
01:35:09 which incidentally, that video is how he met his girlfriend.
01:35:12 Oh!
01:35:13 Because she had no idea.
01:35:14 Like, she had been a huge fan of the T-Bap
01:35:16 and then didn't know that they'd gone on to do all this other stuff
01:35:18 until Ben put up this video, like,
01:35:20 hey, by the way, we're alive and we've been doing stuff for the last year.
01:35:23 That's all great, almost two years.
01:35:26 So, yeah, they just, they just didn't announce it to their old fans.
01:35:30 So that's why their base was so broken.
01:35:33 And then Hippo-
01:35:34 That's bizarre to me.
01:35:35 I don't know why you would make that choice.
01:35:37 Like, I get what you said, but-
01:35:39 Who cares if the audience is all bronies?
01:35:41 Let them watch my fucking anime analysis.
01:35:43 I don't care.
01:35:44 Yeah.
01:35:45 Well, I'm just saying that that's, that's, you know,
01:35:48 my mindset is like, even if everything fails, there's always a pickup.
01:35:53 Like, we can always keep trying,
01:35:55 especially if you have enough money saved up from the previous one.
01:35:58 When I make a Patreon exclusive video,
01:36:00 which is for the $5 and up people,
01:36:02 and I make like, maybe two of these a month,
01:36:04 like, I'll do like a commentary over something
01:36:06 or just talk about something that's going on,
01:36:08 I always tell them,
01:36:10 I'm making these videos just for you,
01:36:12 not the Patreon exclusives,
01:36:14 but every video is just for you guys,
01:36:16 because I could lose every subscriber,
01:36:18 except for the 100 people on Patreon,
01:36:21 and I would still be doing this.
01:36:22 I would still be doing this just for you.
01:36:24 There's no, that's why I've put out two videos this month
01:36:28 that aren't even on YouTube,
01:36:29 because it's like, as long as the patrons are there,
01:36:32 that's all that matters.
01:36:33 And if the patrons start complaining,
01:36:34 that's when I'll start listening, you know?
01:36:36 Like, I put out these videos about
01:36:39 anime soundtrack composers, it's a totally different style,
01:36:42 and like, in the comments on the videos,
01:36:45 there's some people who really love it,
01:36:46 some who don't like it,
01:36:47 but no one's complained on Patreon yet.
01:36:49 So as long as no one complains on Patreon,
01:36:51 those videos keep happening, you know?
01:36:53 Do you think that's healthy, though,
01:36:55 to be subjugated to the opinion specifically of the patrons?
01:36:58 Like, if they complain about something,
01:36:59 would you stop doing it?
01:37:00 I wouldn't stop it just because one guy complained,
01:37:02 or anything, but like, if...
01:37:03 What if it was like a guy who's giving you
01:37:05 100 bucks a video?
01:37:06 Would you be like, oh, well,
01:37:07 maybe I shouldn't do that.
01:37:08 I don't...
01:37:09 No one does that, and when they do,
01:37:11 I don't trust them.
01:37:12 Yeah.
01:37:13 Because there's nothing...
01:37:14 Like, dude, if you're gonna be a patron,
01:37:16 like, at maximum, give $30.
01:37:19 No, not give me 50 yet.
01:37:20 There's a lot of 50s,
01:37:21 and I really like those people.
01:37:22 I don't have any...
01:37:24 I had...
01:37:25 Like, the highest pledge I ever had
01:37:27 that was consistent is this woman named
01:37:30 Anna Esther Volos, who has a couple
01:37:33 YouTube videos that are pretty alright,
01:37:34 and she's like an animator.
01:37:36 And she used to be a patron to, like,
01:37:37 every one of the PCP for, like,
01:37:39 really high amounts.
01:37:40 She gave me, like, $35 a video for years.
01:37:43 Oh, my God.
01:37:44 So she personally has given me, like,
01:37:45 thousands of dollars.
01:37:46 Yo, Anna, hit me up.
01:37:48 But she eventually reduced it a little bit.
01:37:50 But, like, to me, that was like...
01:37:53 That's like the most...
01:37:54 Like, that's the most you could pledge
01:37:56 that I'll take it seriously,
01:37:57 because I've had people...
01:37:58 How could you not take it seriously?
01:38:00 Because I've had people who pledge 100,
01:38:02 and then immediately get declined
01:38:03 and have to reduce it to $5.
01:38:05 You know?
01:38:06 It's like, it happens all the time,
01:38:07 because they always think that it's going
01:38:09 to work one way,
01:38:10 and that it just doesn't work out
01:38:11 the way they think it will.
01:38:12 You know?
01:38:13 They somehow think they're going to
01:38:14 either have $100 to give you,
01:38:15 or that they don't understand
01:38:16 how Patreon works, you know?
01:38:18 Or they get declined,
01:38:19 and then they can't make it go through,
01:38:21 and it's just like...
01:38:22 Because to me, it just inflates my numbers.
01:38:24 Like, I don't want it to look like
01:38:25 I make more than I do.
01:38:26 That's true, because then people will be less willing,
01:38:28 like, oh, why would I give them two bucks?
01:38:29 He's got a thousand.
01:38:30 Yeah, exactly.
01:38:32 So, yeah, well, we've gotten off
01:38:34 into the weeds on that again.
01:38:36 I don't remember...
01:38:37 I don't know where we started.
01:38:39 So, Manimal,
01:38:40 he stopped being on the Let's Play.
01:38:42 Yeah.
01:38:43 Well, now we've got the
01:38:45 Let's Play channel is kind of
01:38:47 free-for-all at this point.
01:38:49 You've got a show with...
01:38:52 You do some with Biggs,
01:38:53 you've got some with Patch,
01:38:54 you've got the Spyro...
01:38:55 Well, those have all come to an end
01:38:56 now that I'm moving.
01:38:57 The Spyro series,
01:38:58 that's with Random Guest each time,
01:39:00 which I think is genius.
01:39:01 Yeah, that's a fun idea.
01:39:03 Since I realized it's so hard
01:39:05 to find a good co-host,
01:39:06 I thought, hey,
01:39:07 let's just let everybody be a co-host.
01:39:09 I'll give just any random person
01:39:11 three episodes to listen to me
01:39:13 play Spyro because they can't see the screen.
01:39:15 So, it's just kind of like an excuse
01:39:17 to have random conversations.
01:39:19 I've had Jess, Hippo,
01:39:21 and Munchie from the PCP,
01:39:23 and then I've had my brother,
01:39:26 my real-life friend Maddie,
01:39:28 and then my internet friend Odd Belly.
01:39:30 And in Spyro 2,
01:39:31 now that Spyro 1's over,
01:39:33 I want to branch out and get, like,
01:39:35 fans and listeners and stuff.
01:39:36 Like, people I don't even know.
01:39:38 But I'm going through a vetting process
01:39:40 to make sure that I can listen to them
01:39:42 for an hour.
01:39:43 That reminds me,
01:39:44 you once had a podcast
01:39:46 called Anime Fight.
01:39:47 Yeah, let's talk about Anime Fight.
01:39:48 Which I've never actually watched,
01:39:50 but because I could tell
01:39:52 from the thumbnail alone
01:39:54 that you had not vetted the people
01:39:56 Odd there,
01:39:57 and that they were a bunch of fucking idiots.
01:39:59 What was the deal with that?
01:40:01 So, a big fan of
01:40:03 the Movie Fights podcast
01:40:05 on Screen Junkies,
01:40:07 where there's a judge,
01:40:09 and they give you a topic like,
01:40:11 what is the best Quentin Tarantino movie?
01:40:13 And then the three contestants argue it out,
01:40:15 and then the judge awards a point to the winner.
01:40:17 And I thought, hey,
01:40:18 let's do that with Anime.
01:40:20 But I'll let the fans join in,
01:40:22 because I love my fan interaction.
01:40:24 So I was like, hey,
01:40:25 send me an email if you want to join in,
01:40:27 and you can be on the show.
01:40:28 Surely enough, we got, you know,
01:40:30 nine people in total.
01:40:32 Actually, Baku Boys,
01:40:33 who we talked about earlier,
01:40:34 was on one of them,
01:40:35 and he actually won,
01:40:36 just because he was the funniest.
01:40:38 Because the idea was,
01:40:40 it's not a serious Anime Fight.
01:40:42 They're all emulating me,
01:40:44 and they all chose to do this
01:40:46 of their own accord.
01:40:47 They're trying to do the
01:40:48 monkey memes of, oh,
01:40:50 World War II is an anime
01:40:52 that had over 6 million
01:40:54 people who didn't like it,
01:40:56 and that kind of shit.
01:40:58 But most of them
01:41:00 weren't very good at doing monkey.
01:41:02 No.
01:41:03 Not, you know,
01:41:05 not everyone's a comedian.
01:41:07 Especially not in a very specific
01:41:09 personal style of one comedian
01:41:11 that you're trying to emulate.
01:41:13 And it doesn't help that most of them
01:41:14 are like 15 and 16 year old guys.
01:41:16 Right.
01:41:17 Like recording it kind of quietly
01:41:19 upstairs, hoping that their parents
01:41:21 don't hear what they're saying.
01:41:22 Doing the soft scream.
01:41:24 Yeah.
01:41:25 And that's why Death Note
01:41:27 is the best anime
01:41:29 of all time.
01:41:31 So if you want to just,
01:41:33 if you want to cringe really hard
01:41:35 for hours at a time,
01:41:37 I'd say go watch the old anime fights.
01:41:39 Full body cringe.
01:41:41 I accidentally clicked on one.
01:41:43 And even just hearing my introduction,
01:41:45 I don't know if I had to get out of there.
01:41:47 Even, I cringe that myself.
01:41:50 Terrible.
01:41:52 Even the shitposts
01:41:54 master himself can't sit through
01:41:56 with that level.
01:41:58 I've never watched them.
01:42:00 They just uploaded immediately after.
01:42:02 They were live streams.
01:42:03 So there was a live audience the whole time.
01:42:05 So I didn't have to watch it.
01:42:07 Incredible.
01:42:13 I love it.
01:42:14 You just have it all this time.
01:42:16 You still have never even bothered.
01:42:18 I'm not going to take them down.
01:42:20 I'm sure somebody can get something out of it.
01:42:22 Maybe it's like the Digibro idea
01:42:24 of never taking anything down
01:42:26 so they can see how I've grown.
01:42:28 So that's just like...
01:42:30 There's a dark corner in my channel.
01:42:32 There is a bunch of stuff that's set to private
01:42:34 on my old blog.
01:42:36 I don't know if I would...
01:42:38 It's too late to go back and make it all public now.
01:42:40 But I don't know if I still would have hidden it today.
01:42:42 I just know that I did at the time
01:42:44 because I was like,
01:42:46 well, here's a lot of tracks that need to be covered.
01:42:48 Let's not let all this exist
01:42:50 for too much longer.
01:42:52 What were the sorts of things on there?
01:42:54 Otaku sexuality analysis.
01:42:58 That seems like something you would do today.
01:43:00 I would,
01:43:02 but not in the same way.
01:43:04 How did you do it?
01:43:06 It's just that the way I wrote back then...
01:43:08 Was the hentai samurai giving you advice?
01:43:10 Me and the hentai samurai
01:43:12 go way back.
01:43:14 I imagine.
01:43:16 He's like a father figure to you.
01:43:18 He's grown a lot as an artist over the last decade.
01:43:20 With his whole one video.
01:43:24 He did have some guest posts,
01:43:26 actually, on my old blog.
01:43:28 They were published under my name.
01:43:30 I never...
01:43:32 He was shy back then.
01:43:34 He didn't want anybody to know his real name,
01:43:36 Hentai Samurai.
01:43:38 He didn't have the mask yet.
01:43:40 He didn't have the underwear mask,
01:43:42 so he didn't want to be public without the mask.
01:43:46 Anyway, oh god,
01:43:48 I don't remember what we were saying again.
01:43:50 This has been a series
01:43:52 of me forgetting what the fuck we were talking about.
01:43:54 You're the navigator, so you figure it out,
01:43:56 because I don't remember either.
01:43:58 Let me think of some more shit to ask you about.
01:44:00 We've mostly been focused on your
01:44:02 sort of YouTube career,
01:44:04 but it seems like that's kind of dominated your life.
01:44:06 Tell us about what you were trying to do
01:44:08 in college,
01:44:10 because we know you almost
01:44:12 became a teacher
01:44:14 well into...
01:44:16 This was only recently that you finally abandoned this...
01:44:18 This terrible dream.
01:44:20 Yeah.
01:44:22 The only thing that I was really good at
01:44:24 in high school was English.
01:44:26 I was in all the advanced English classes.
01:44:28 All my papers I would write
01:44:30 in like five hours,
01:44:32 and then get an A on where everybody else would be like,
01:44:34 oh, it was so hard to write three-page paper,
01:44:36 because I'm a retarded 17-year-old.
01:44:38 I always over...
01:44:40 Oh, of course.
01:44:42 It's like easy and fun
01:44:44 to put out an argument.
01:44:46 All I wanted them to do was like,
01:44:48 every day I was like, when are we going to get another written assignment?
01:44:50 If that was all this class was,
01:44:52 school would be amazing.
01:44:54 The best class I've taken in my life
01:44:56 was creative writing in high school,
01:44:58 but that's partly because
01:45:00 all my friends got into it too,
01:45:02 and it was just the constant harassment hour.
01:45:04 There's that one writing exercise
01:45:06 where everybody
01:45:08 writes a paragraph of a story
01:45:10 that has it behind you.
01:45:12 And this motherfucker, one of my
01:45:14 good buddies, his name was
01:45:16 Zach.
01:45:18 So Zach would ruin every single
01:45:20 story with this character he created
01:45:22 called Earthquake Man,
01:45:24 and he wouldn't even read what had been happening.
01:45:26 He would just write down,
01:45:28 and then Earthquake Man killed everybody
01:45:30 in the world with an earthquake.
01:45:32 And my poor-bodied chum
01:45:34 was sitting behind him,
01:45:36 so he would have to pick up the pieces
01:45:38 of the asteroid world time and time again
01:45:40 and try to
01:45:42 resurrect everybody who had been killed
01:45:44 by Earthquake Man.
01:45:46 So that was like
01:45:48 shitposting the class.
01:45:50 We ruined it for everybody,
01:45:52 and it was tons of fun.
01:45:54 It sounds like your whole life has been shitposting their life.
01:45:56 It was fun.
01:45:58 I loved that class.
01:46:00 So yeah, in college,
01:46:02 I was like, okay, I guess I'll major in English.
01:46:04 I knew there were no prospects in that.
01:46:06 I don't need a major in English to do that.
01:46:08 I just need to write a book.
01:46:10 So it got to the point
01:46:12 in my sophomore year when I realized,
01:46:14 well, if I'm really doing this English major,
01:46:16 my only option is to be a teacher.
01:46:18 That's the only career path that this leads to,
01:46:20 as far as I know.
01:46:22 So I studied to be a teacher.
01:46:24 I kind of liked it.
01:46:26 I did student teaching a little bit.
01:46:28 I would go into classrooms and give lessons and stuff.
01:46:30 I thought it was okay.
01:46:32 I've always liked kids.
01:46:34 I've always either gotten along with people
01:46:36 who were younger than me,
01:46:38 or way older than me.
01:46:40 I typically don't hang out with people my own age.
01:46:42 Not my own age or one year older.
01:46:44 Well, because younger people always look up to me.
01:46:46 And I think you probably for the same reason
01:46:48 we have a younger brother
01:46:50 who's pretty close.
01:46:52 And so I think it's like you have a certain
01:46:54 nurturing tendency towards younger people.
01:46:56 And like,
01:46:58 all growing up,
01:47:00 most of my friends were usually just Victor's friends.
01:47:02 People who he had around
01:47:04 who would also
01:47:06 treat me like I was their big brother
01:47:08 as well.
01:47:10 And Manimol was two years older than me,
01:47:12 so that was perfect for me.
01:47:14 I hang out with all the older kids,
01:47:16 lightning along Johnson the same.
01:47:18 Cobb even was a year older than me in school.
01:47:20 Didn't have a whole lot of friends in my own grade,
01:47:22 but that's fine.
01:47:24 So yeah, I like people.
01:47:26 Typically I get along better with those who were younger
01:47:28 and those who were older.
01:47:30 And then I started doing monkey.
01:47:32 And I was like, well, as soon as this is found,
01:47:34 teaching's over.
01:47:36 They're not letting me into school.
01:47:38 So I was really disheartened by that,
01:47:40 thinking, well, I just wasted four years of my life
01:47:42 at this college.
01:47:44 And then I make a couple videos and now I'm fucked.
01:47:46 You make one a Feebiel file video
01:47:48 and it's game over when it comes to teaching.
01:47:50 As soon as they find it, it's game over.
01:47:52 So when they announced,
01:47:54 I went to the meeting for
01:47:56 the big student teaching thing,
01:47:58 I went to school for like a whole semester,
01:48:00 like half a year.
01:48:02 And just hearing all this shit they were saying
01:48:04 and all the papers I had to fill out
01:48:06 and all this garbage.
01:48:08 I thought, I don't want to do this.
01:48:10 People have told me all the time
01:48:12 that like people watch my videos and I'm like,
01:48:14 you'd be a great teacher. Why don't you teach at university?
01:48:16 I'm like, because do you know what teachers have to do?
01:48:18 It's not just get up in front of a class
01:48:20 and be eloquent for an hour.
01:48:22 It's like work constantly
01:48:24 and tirelessly for no money.
01:48:26 Right. It's a lot of unpaid overtime
01:48:28 that people don't understand.
01:48:30 I appreciate teachers infinitely more
01:48:32 than ever because I've gone through the whole process
01:48:34 of what it's like being one.
01:48:36 And I also now know
01:48:38 which teachers really sucked
01:48:40 and why they sucked at their job.
01:48:42 So I have a new found respect for it
01:48:44 but I just don't think I can do it
01:48:46 and now I'm kind of in this weird limbo of
01:48:48 I don't have a job, I can't get a job
01:48:50 right now because I'm in the middle of moving
01:48:52 and I don't know what to do
01:48:54 with my career path.
01:48:56 I have a useless English degree
01:48:58 as Avenue Q would say
01:49:00 what do you do
01:49:02 with a B.A. in English?
01:49:04 So I'm in that position
01:49:06 and I have this
01:49:08 beacon light reaching out to me
01:49:10 saying,
01:49:12 do monkey has a job
01:49:14 and that's just crazy.
01:49:16 Right.
01:49:18 And you've got these PCP guys who
01:49:20 when I found you, you were very like
01:49:22 oh, this YouTube is not a job.
01:49:24 I still feel that way.
01:49:26 You kind of had a chip on your shoulder
01:49:28 about it though and I first talked to you
01:49:30 that you were like...
01:49:32 Oh, it's just pure jealousy.
01:49:34 The fact that you can do this as a job makes me sick
01:49:36 because I want to.
01:49:38 But then as you became friends with the PCP
01:49:40 it started seeming like you were taking your Patreon
01:49:42 more and more seriously and that it became
01:49:44 like once you knew other guys who were doing it
01:49:46 it's like well fuck, if Digi's making all this money
01:49:48 why am I not making all this money?
01:49:50 I'm just going to say right now I'm sitting at
01:49:52 19,000 subscribers which thank you
01:49:54 you gave me a thousand in a day from your
01:49:56 your big famous video.
01:49:58 But if I'm making $600 a month
01:50:00 at 19,000 subs in my mind
01:50:02 like just you double the subs
01:50:04 you double the money. I see that correlation
01:50:06 in my head.
01:50:08 So I'm just at like the cusp
01:50:10 of becoming like a
01:50:12 D-list YouTube celebrity
01:50:14 and I think if I do, you know
01:50:16 get this to continue to grow
01:50:18 and sustain me as an actual career
01:50:20 but it's so unknown.
01:50:22 That's something I'm glad you thought of it that way
01:50:24 because I had two and I think a lot of people
01:50:26 don't. They don't think about the fact that
01:50:28 like every small amount of
01:50:30 growth on YouTube is exactly
01:50:32 that much to your paycheck
01:50:34 and like if you
01:50:36 like a lot of people are thinking like
01:50:38 man I'm really wallowing in this like 10k
01:50:40 realm or whatever
01:50:42 and then you don't even think about the fact that
01:50:44 like they're thinking everyone's eyes is on the
01:50:46 horizon like everyone's thinking
01:50:48 man I have to hit 100,000 before this will be
01:50:50 serious but if you just double
01:50:52 your subs you double your money
01:50:54 you know like almost
01:50:56 if it's correlating to the
01:50:58 view counts you know and so people don't realize
01:51:00 like even making a small step
01:51:02 you know it all affects
01:51:04 what you're making you know it's
01:51:06 always a constant incline
01:51:08 and everyone's so worried about catching
01:51:10 the brass ring at the top that they're not thinking
01:51:12 about how every step up the ladder is also
01:51:14 an improvement you know. Yeah
01:51:16 people don't seem to understand that if you have
01:51:18 40,000 subs you could be
01:51:20 living very comfortably like that could be your
01:51:22 full-time job at 40,000 subs
01:51:24 if you just did digibro after dark I think you'd
01:51:26 still make a decent amount of money
01:51:28 if uh if the I mean
01:51:30 I would if I just if I came out tomorrow
01:51:32 and said uh digibros cancelled
01:51:34 it's all after dark now I
01:51:36 your patreon would be like 10%
01:51:38 of what it is today it would
01:51:40 it would plummet yeah um
01:51:42 I wouldn't have to pay DeVoo and
01:51:44 I you know
01:51:46 wouldn't have to pay as much in taxes I think
01:51:48 because I've had a lot of patrons
01:51:50 telling me I will patron after dark
01:51:52 I have lots of people telling me like I don't
01:51:54 care about the main channel I just care
01:51:56 about after dark uh you know
01:51:58 like I just follow you as a person
01:52:00 so if I cancelled digibro
01:52:02 first of all I wouldn't lose all the patrons immediately
01:52:04 second of all I'd probably put more
01:52:06 effort into after dark because I wouldn't have to
01:52:08 worry about the main channel so I think
01:52:10 some I would argue that some of the
01:52:12 like the big 20 30 minute vlogs
01:52:14 you do on there about even like things
01:52:16 in anime more interesting yeah I
01:52:18 like those more than normal videos
01:52:20 the reason I do so much after dark is that I legitimately
01:52:22 love it yeah it's just harder
01:52:24 for me to charge for it because it's hard to draw the
01:52:26 line it's hard to say like where does
01:52:28 what's the difference between an
01:52:30 after dark video that is patronable one that's
01:52:32 not because I also love
01:52:34 stuff like insomnia analysis
01:52:36 which is like an hour of me doing
01:52:38 random weird shit right that a
01:52:40 lot of people will not sit through but
01:52:42 to me that would be like the most
01:52:44 patronable video you know like if there was
01:52:46 a channel doing all stuff like that I'd be
01:52:48 patient to it but like so it's it's hard
01:52:50 to draw the line of like what's worth and what's
01:52:52 not so I just make it very clear if it's a
01:52:54 main channel video it's patron if it's not
01:52:56 it's not you know unless it's like a
01:52:58 podcast it's on the main channel or something
01:53:00 but like yeah if I
01:53:02 if I'd went full after dark I think I
01:53:04 could still make a few hundred dollars on
01:53:06 after dark I'd still make enough ad revenue
01:53:08 to kind of it would just be
01:53:10 where I was as a pony guy
01:53:12 like I could probably make
01:53:14 three hundred dollars a video put out four videos
01:53:16 a month well I guess I'd probably
01:53:18 change the I don't know how
01:53:20 how I'd do per video on
01:53:22 after dark I don't think you should I think
01:53:24 after dark would be a per week
01:53:26 I think has to be per month and you can do
01:53:28 what Tom Oliver was doing
01:53:30 for a long time was just he would make a
01:53:32 patron post every week so it was
01:53:34 set as per like his because you can just
01:53:36 write in per whatever yeah so
01:53:38 he wrote in per week and then he would just
01:53:40 collect all his videos from all his different channels
01:53:42 hmm that's a smart idea
01:53:44 so if I wish I could do that but they won't let me
01:53:46 change it now that I'm stuck in the month thing
01:53:48 oh yeah I feel like I'd be making more
01:53:50 if I did it I'll let you change to the other
01:53:52 not it's too late
01:53:54 I have the setting where
01:53:56 as soon as somebody pledges the money immediately get charged
01:53:58 yeah so now I can't change anything I'm just like stuck
01:54:00 yeah
01:54:02 yeah I would do it per week
01:54:04 and I would probably
01:54:06 make I could probably still make
01:54:08 over a thousand dollars a month on just
01:54:10 after dark and I mean that's minimum
01:54:12 wage working at some that's what it was
01:54:14 that's what I was making up to last year
01:54:16 when the channel suddenly blew up so
01:54:18 um yeah
01:54:20 uh I
01:54:22 encourage you to try to
01:54:24 be a youtuber because I think you're cut out for it
01:54:26 in a way that not a lot of other people are
01:54:28 you know then I'm just worried about the benefits
01:54:30 and what if I get sick
01:54:32 like insurance is a lot of money
01:54:34 and luckily I do have until
01:54:36 like what I'm 26 to get off my parents
01:54:38 insurance
01:54:40 no no that's one thing he's gonna keep
01:54:42 yeah he said he's gonna keep that
01:54:44 yeah so it's all good
01:54:46 maybe we're in luck
01:54:48 ugh that chump guy
01:54:50 pretty cool guy
01:54:52 I don't want to talk about Trump on here do I have to
01:54:54 uh no you don't have to
01:54:56 I want us to go for another hour
01:54:58 I kind of have to like
01:55:00 excrete everything from every orifice
01:55:02 of my body you want to put this on hold for a little
01:55:04 bit yeah I'm fine with it
01:55:06 yeah alright um
01:55:08 just remember to edit out the shitting part
01:55:10 yeah okay
01:55:12 we're back from the crapper we're back from
01:55:14 evacuating those bowels
01:55:16 ever been more empty so monkey
01:55:18 I wanted to ask you some stuff about your
01:55:20 influences okay um
01:55:22 part not only
01:55:24 in a few different ways
01:55:26 like for instance that we
01:55:28 both seem to have the same stance
01:55:30 on uh
01:55:32 on working
01:55:34 working putting putting out lots of content
01:55:36 and sort of being self motivated
01:55:38 and stuff and when I brought up
01:55:40 Quentin Tarantino you immediately
01:55:42 had a quote from him that you cited
01:55:44 so like was that
01:55:46 were you influenced by him and his ethos
01:55:48 or like who kind of inspired you to work the way you do
01:55:50 uh well to
01:55:52 to say about the Quentin Tarantino quote
01:55:54 it's because that's a meme on
01:55:56 tv the 4chan board
01:55:58 where like they use it I guess to make fun of him
01:56:00 even though his films are great so I don't
01:56:02 know what the joke is even though that phrase
01:56:04 makes I mean perfect sense
01:56:06 like if anything it's uh bragging
01:56:08 right I think they interpret
01:56:10 it as being just extremely pretentious but
01:56:12 if if anybody
01:56:14 has earned being pretentious it's Quentin Tarantino
01:56:16 because his movies are great
01:56:18 uh so what was
01:56:20 the question who who sort of influenced
01:56:22 your uh work ethic where did
01:56:24 you get the idea to work the way you do
01:56:26 oh that's just something I've had since
01:56:28 I was born but
01:56:30 god like even in
01:56:32 elementary school I was just chugging along
01:56:34 doing those multiplication tables
01:56:36 I just have to keep working all the time
01:56:38 or else I I guess I fall into depression
01:56:40 I don't know it's just it's an
01:56:42 innate drive like there's
01:56:44 an inner locomotive that just keeps
01:56:46 chugging along and I can sometimes hear
01:56:48 it just in
01:56:50 my head I've I've previously described
01:56:52 my own depression as
01:56:54 like it's all it's a base level
01:56:56 like on a basic level you're always
01:56:58 depressed and everything else is just
01:57:00 stuff you're stacking on top of that
01:57:02 and so you need it
01:57:04 because as soon as it's not there you fall back
01:57:06 to the basic level and would you say
01:57:08 that your work is like that like like
01:57:10 when you're not making work you're
01:57:12 depressed or when you're not like doing something
01:57:14 talking to somebody but then so
01:57:16 like you have to do it to keep away
01:57:18 from the depression I think that's
01:57:20 a perfect summation because I
01:57:22 hardly ever feel
01:57:24 suicidal or like
01:57:26 depressed to a point where it like physically hurts
01:57:28 when I'm working on a video or writing a script
01:57:30 or I guess
01:57:32 watching Survivor but that's not really working
01:57:34 well I think that's what I mean by like
01:57:36 doing something right you know like something that makes
01:57:38 you that that brings
01:57:40 something out of you that makes it so you're not
01:57:42 just sitting around thinking about
01:57:44 depression and for those of you at home
01:57:46 who don't relate to this you're probably thinking
01:57:48 well it's as simple as just
01:57:50 if you don't want to feel depressed go do a thing
01:57:52 and that logically makes sense
01:57:54 but once you fall into the trap
01:57:56 like you get convinced that you don't feel like
01:57:58 doing anything at all and I think
01:58:00 there's all these movies I want to watch but I don't really
01:58:02 feel like watching them
01:58:04 one of the most
01:58:06 the most resonant criticisms I
01:58:08 ever got was from my
01:58:10 mentor Ghost Lightning where I was complaining
01:58:12 about I was telling him about something
01:58:14 I wanted to make like I was kind of bragging
01:58:16 about something that I had an idea for but I
01:58:18 hadn't actually made it so why am I bragging?
01:58:20 Good job, Animal. Good job, Cob.
01:58:22 Yeah this is me before
01:58:24 YouTube you know back when I was an anime blogger
01:58:26 so I'm bragging about some idea
01:58:28 I have and he's like why don't you you know why don't you
01:58:30 work on that thing I think I was telling him
01:58:32 I was like upset or something he was like why don't
01:58:34 you work on that thing you were talking about and I was like I'm not in the mood
01:58:36 and he said you you have a real
01:58:38 problem with always letting these moods control
01:58:40 you and I thought I never
01:58:42 thought about it as something you had power over
01:58:44 that like you have to try to
01:58:46 escape the mood because
01:58:48 the mood if you if you just let yourself
01:58:50 be governed by moods you'll never do anything
01:58:52 you know you'll just be like well I'm depressed I'm not
01:58:54 in the mood to do this or that so it's always
01:58:56 a fight like like when I
01:58:58 when I get out of that it's not because I'm
01:59:00 like just able
01:59:02 to change it it's like it takes a real
01:59:04 like effort to like examine
01:59:06 what you're doing and be like no I have
01:59:08 to make a video today
01:59:10 like this has to happen
01:59:12 you know or else I'm uh I'm
01:59:14 fucked so do you think there's a lot
01:59:16 of that like just trying to keep
01:59:18 to your schedule and stuff is that what like
01:59:20 motivates you to help get you out of those those
01:59:22 funks yeah it definitely prevents them
01:59:24 from occurring in the first
01:59:26 place it's kind of have you seen the movie
01:59:28 never ending story
01:59:30 not so there's something called the swamps
01:59:32 of sadness where if
01:59:34 if you're standing in it and you're feeling
01:59:36 sad you'll keep sinking but if you have positive
01:59:38 thoughts you can keep going through and
01:59:40 it's the saddest part of the movie because the horse
01:59:42 drowns to death and the swamp is like kids
01:59:44 movie is very intense
01:59:46 and the kid is screaming and crying
01:59:48 but I think depression in a
01:59:50 way is like the swamps of sadness where
01:59:52 if you just think of other things
01:59:54 you can keep walking through the muck but
01:59:56 once you start sinking it's hard to get back
01:59:58 out so I
02:00:00 so having the schedule is
02:00:02 is like my version of keep
02:00:04 on walking through the swamp
02:00:06 so how how much
02:00:08 like what do you think you're
02:00:10 what are you trying to communicate
02:00:12 in your videos because it like
02:00:14 is your main motivation just to be funny
02:00:16 and to be entertaining for people because like
02:00:18 for me so much
02:00:20 of it comes from a desire to be understood
02:00:22 to like like like
02:00:24 the reason I have to make these analysis videos is that
02:00:26 if I go out there and I say chaos the greatest
02:00:28 anime of all time or something
02:00:30 people are just gonna look at me like I'm insane
02:00:32 unless I justify it you know
02:00:34 so to me so much of my videos
02:00:36 is like justifying these opinions I have
02:00:38 so that people will understand where I'm coming
02:00:40 from but your videos
02:00:42 deliberately obfuscate
02:00:44 your opinions to such an extent that there's
02:00:46 lots of people who just don't understand
02:00:48 what your opinions actually are on on most
02:00:50 things does that ever bother
02:00:52 you at all or does it like is it a problem at all
02:00:54 that you have created it cultivated a
02:00:56 character of just not being able to
02:00:58 be understood the last couple
02:01:00 PCPs I've been on
02:01:02 I just
02:01:04 shitposted and I hope people appreciated
02:01:06 them because otherwise it's got to be terrible
02:01:08 listening to me talk we did one like
02:01:10 how did you lose your virginity story and I just
02:01:12 described the plot of moonlight exactly
02:01:14 so and that's because
02:01:16 I think that me as a
02:01:18 person as a human being I don't find myself
02:01:20 interesting and I don't
02:01:22 think other people would if I let myself
02:01:24 go that much
02:01:26 so I'm not that interested I'd rather
02:01:28 just you know do be
02:01:30 I don't want to be me because it's fine
02:01:32 who cares I don't think anybody
02:01:34 should care do you feel like it backfires
02:01:36 it all though when like for instance
02:01:38 in the in the PCP chat I've described
02:01:40 you as the boy who cried wolf because
02:01:42 anytime you try to be sincere nobody
02:01:44 can tell because you've
02:01:46 gone so far into presenting an
02:01:48 insincere character I mean
02:01:50 I'm okay with that it's fine yeah
02:01:52 it doesn't bother me that much you don't
02:01:54 you don't find it like a frustrating when
02:01:56 people can't tell when you're trying
02:01:58 to be real about something well I think
02:02:00 if it's a main video like the
02:02:02 Elliot Roger one I don't think very many people
02:02:04 think I was being ironic in that one yeah
02:02:06 you kind of well you use a very different tone
02:02:08 and everything
02:02:10 and I'm and there's not really
02:02:12 any jokes in that video so
02:02:14 it's pretty clearly straightforward
02:02:16 yeah and then like
02:02:18 the countdown to suicide channel I don't
02:02:20 I don't shit post on there ever other than
02:02:22 my drunken live streams but that's just fun
02:02:24 yeah well that's what I like about that channel
02:02:26 so much is that I can always kind of
02:02:28 trust it like it always feels like okay
02:02:30 I think that's why
02:02:32 like that was kind of the key for me
02:02:34 understanding you enough to feel like
02:02:36 that we could be friends because if
02:02:38 all you did was shit post constantly
02:02:40 I just wouldn't be even be able to have a
02:02:42 conversation with you right but I was
02:02:44 like well there's clearly like a guy in
02:02:46 there somewhere it's just a super boring
02:02:48 guy who needs to
02:02:50 always be ironic or satirical
02:02:52 in order to be interesting because I
02:02:54 like
02:02:56 yes me like what what do I do on a daily basis
02:02:58 if I fucking I do what everybody else does I jerk
02:03:00 off once I sit there watch TV
02:03:02 that make videos and only the videos part
02:03:04 should be like anybody
02:03:06 should care about nobody should care
02:03:08 about what I as a human being
02:03:10 do I'm not saying that like I want to protect
02:03:12 myself or like oh don't look
02:03:14 at me don't look behind the curtain but because it's
02:03:16 just genuinely uninteresting
02:03:18 right I mean
02:03:20 I find the countdown to suicide videos
02:03:22 interesting but
02:03:24 I mean do you not think that if you
02:03:26 made like if you could convert
02:03:28 the the sort of what you're talking
02:03:30 about in the countdown to suicide videos into
02:03:32 main series serious content do you
02:03:34 think people would would find that interesting
02:03:36 well I think the depression review is the
02:03:38 closest thing I've come to doing that
02:03:40 and a lot of people seem
02:03:42 affected by that video
02:03:44 in I don't know if it's a positive or
02:03:46 negative way but both are
02:03:48 I think good do you think you
02:03:50 would you would consider like
02:03:52 when monkeys anime reviews is over are you
02:03:54 going to bring more sincere content
02:03:56 to oh yes yes I'm
02:03:58 going to branch out I've got
02:04:00 three different types of videos I want
02:04:02 to make I talked about the isms one
02:04:04 but what level of sincerity
02:04:06 would that one be
02:04:08 that's gonna be all over the place like sometimes
02:04:10 I'll be talking about how great
02:04:12 feminism feminism is
02:04:14 and then like I'll be shitting on atheism
02:04:16 even though I'm an atheist like just a bunch
02:04:18 of crazy wacky fun stuff
02:04:20 because I think that would be
02:04:22 it's somewhere in between
02:04:24 me and you is where is where endless
02:04:26 Jess is where you've been like
02:04:28 nonstop inauthentic and I've been
02:04:30 nonstop authentic because I have such a
02:04:32 difficult time making a video
02:04:34 because I've had times before where I make
02:04:36 something like your style and then people
02:04:38 will message me like well what's your actual
02:04:40 opinion people people are so invested
02:04:42 in like what I think about stuff that they're
02:04:44 like oh well it sucks that we don't get
02:04:46 to make a follow-up vlog explaining
02:04:48 my actual opinion about something
02:04:50 and Jesse kind of falls
02:04:52 in the middle where he'll represent both in the same
02:04:54 video and that's why
02:04:56 his so much of his audience can't
02:04:58 parse the difference and that's why
02:05:00 there's so many misunderstandings around them
02:05:02 because it seems to be difficult do you think
02:05:04 that this that you'll run into this
02:05:06 issue and would it bother you even
02:05:08 if it did like does it bother
02:05:10 you to not be understood in your intentions
02:05:12 no
02:05:14 because it's so rare that it's even
02:05:16 relevant to
02:05:18 I don't I can't think of one instance
02:05:20 where I was being super sincere in a
02:05:22 video and that people wrote it off as
02:05:24 being sarcastic
02:05:26 or disingenuous do you think there's more
02:05:28 of a chance of that once you mix the
02:05:30 like for instance
02:05:32 I mean to me this was clear
02:05:34 but I don't know if it would be to everyone else
02:05:36 that when you did your 10 anime heroes
02:05:38 the whole Hank Hill analysis is like
02:05:40 a completely legitimate and great
02:05:42 analysis of why Hank Hill is such a good
02:05:44 character and I was like well this seems
02:05:46 sincere to me but will people think
02:05:48 do you not know the story behind
02:05:50 the Hank Hill part no what so
02:05:52 so that's a that's a copypasta
02:05:54 I didn't write that oh I didn't know
02:05:56 that at all yeah I I
02:05:58 told more people caught on but a lot of people
02:06:00 just kind of praised me as like a great
02:06:02 analysis of Hank Hill
02:06:04 great point about why he's a good kid now that
02:06:06 you've mentioned it I feel like I've heard it
02:06:08 years ago like like a long time ago
02:06:10 it gets posted and every king of the hill
02:06:12 thread on TV I see
02:06:14 I thought it was funny like somebody
02:06:16 took the time to write that and I was like
02:06:18 I'm putting it in well see now now you understand
02:06:20 that your intentions work
02:06:22 everyone thinks you're an amazing analyst but
02:06:24 that's a good thing I'll take it
02:06:26 don't tell everybody
02:06:28 listening don't tell anybody that I didn't write that
02:06:30 I'll take the credit it's fine but are you at all
02:06:32 concerned that in the future when you try to
02:06:34 make more sincere content that people won't
02:06:36 understand well so I did
02:06:38 something I did that a while ago I did
02:06:40 the top five YouTube channels that
02:06:42 deserve more subscribers and I don't think anybody
02:06:44 thought that was sarcastic I think
02:06:46 I mean I explained what the channel was
02:06:48 and why I liked it and it's hard
02:06:50 there's no clear joke
02:06:52 then because I know
02:06:54 um Jesse was
02:06:56 saying how he was you you had said
02:06:58 that you you floated the idea of having
02:07:00 monkeys reviews and jimmies reviews making
02:07:02 it very clear the distinction between
02:07:04 that idea didn't last very long
02:07:06 yeah well just because
02:07:08 it's less funny that way
02:07:10 the ambiguity makes it funnier
02:07:12 but it also makes it riskier
02:07:14 because you never know what you're gonna get when you click
02:07:16 on the video is he actually gonna talk about the
02:07:18 top 10 anime heroes that's the thing it relies
02:07:20 more on the audience to understand
02:07:22 you know it's that like it's
02:07:24 if you make it completely distinct
02:07:26 then it might
02:07:28 it's more audience friendly maybe
02:07:30 well it's more audience friendly
02:07:32 but it also is
02:07:34 less artistically
02:07:36 interesting you know and that's why
02:07:38 Jesse was so adamantly against it even though
02:07:40 if he did that it would cause
02:07:42 none of these misunderstandings would happen
02:07:44 but he wants to put faith on the audience
02:07:46 and I'm wondering
02:07:48 I'm surprised he is putting faith in the intelligence
02:07:50 of his audience he seems like he wouldn't do that
02:07:52 it's that he would rather
02:07:54 elevate them rather than
02:07:56 stupid to them that's how he sees
02:07:58 that's kind of how he sees the whole world
02:08:00 rather than bringing my stuff
02:08:02 down to your level you have to come up to my level
02:08:04 unfortunately they won't do it
02:08:06 because they're idiots
02:08:08 how do you
02:08:10 how much faith do you have in your audience's intelligence?
02:08:12 I just think
02:08:14 it's all in the script
02:08:16 and if it's clear that I'm not making jokes
02:08:18 then like they should know
02:08:20 I actually mean what I'm saying
02:08:22 it's hard to get out of those moods
02:08:24 when you're kind of sinking in the swamp
02:08:26 and I was there's this video idea
02:08:28 I've had for a while that I think I'm gonna do next month
02:08:30 just
02:08:32 my top five favorite YouTube videos
02:08:34 and these are the videos that I always
02:08:36 go to when I'm feeling bad
02:08:38 and they never fail to make me laugh
02:08:40 or to smile and I was just gonna show them off
02:08:42 and say go watch these fucking videos
02:08:44 they work for me
02:08:46 I don't think anybody can misinterpret that
02:08:48 because it's so straight forward
02:08:50 why would I waste the time giving
02:08:52 reviews of random videos
02:08:54 that make me laugh
02:08:56 if I wasn't being serious about it
02:08:58 yeah I think
02:09:00 but you are putting some level of faith
02:09:02 in the audience's intelligence there
02:09:04 but I think you're definitely
02:09:06 doing enough to
02:09:08 but even if they misinterpret it
02:09:10 I don't see really the negative
02:09:12 if somebody watches that and thinks it's satired
02:09:14 it's not very bothered by not being
02:09:16 understood
02:09:18 I don't know why
02:09:20 for me it's just I can't do it
02:09:22 like the second someone misunderstands
02:09:24 I have to correct them
02:09:26 to one guy's comment
02:09:28 that misinterpreted it and I'm like
02:09:30 well I don't want to have to type out the whole reason
02:09:32 that this isn't the case so let me go
02:09:34 record a fucking 30 minute vlog
02:09:36 I have to pee really badly
02:09:38 we'll just cut this part out
02:09:40 um uh uh
02:09:42 damn it I know something I was gonna ask you
02:09:44 but I forgot I'll think about it while I pee
02:09:46 that's fine I suck at talking when you're out of the room anyway
02:09:48 make noises
02:09:56 fuck cub
02:09:58 fuck cub
02:10:00 better eat those chippies while you can girl
02:10:02 I've been eating them
02:10:04 how dare you
02:10:06 I'm a sneaky eater
02:10:08 sneaky girl
02:10:10 fuck cub
02:10:12 we gotta keep saying that even after I move
02:10:14 yeah
02:10:16 I can't live without saying fuck cub
02:10:18 we'll walk around the house and sing that
02:10:20 that's when I walk into the room and say it and walk out
02:10:22 fuck cub
02:10:24 fuck cub
02:10:26 fuck cub
02:10:28 fuck cub
02:10:30 yeah he says it back
02:10:32 fuck cub
02:10:34 fuck cub
02:10:36 sorry I'm such a leaky boy
02:10:38 that's okay I'm sure once we start drinking and we're doing a let's play
02:10:40 I'll be getting up between every episode again
02:10:42 yeah well we usually both are
02:10:44 so um
02:10:46 alright to get back into your influences
02:10:48 what are your influences like what are the direct influences
02:10:50 what is your style made of
02:10:52 I have a lot of guesses but you can
02:10:54 share some
02:10:56 well I guess in the video
02:10:58 we talked about earlier the mumkees anime reviews
02:11:00 of mumkees anime reviews
02:11:02 they're pretty much just list everybody
02:11:04 it's like the biggest problem in the
02:11:06 universe
02:11:08 Jon's run a little bit
02:11:10 I don't know I think that
02:11:12 I was listing like half
02:11:14 influences and half people
02:11:16 who everybody says I'm stealing from
02:11:18 but I've never actually like
02:11:20 I'm not inspired by them at all
02:11:22 like video game dunkey I like his videos
02:11:24 but I wouldn't say my style is even
02:11:26 close to what he does in any way
02:11:28 other than that our names are
02:11:30 kind of similar it's just having any
02:11:32 irreverence whatsoever everyone gets
02:11:34 compared it's like everyone
02:11:36 compares you to Jesse which is a closer comparison
02:11:38 but his are more like actual anime
02:11:40 reviews and yours are like
02:11:42 nonsensical and it would be
02:11:44 it's impossible to say that I'm inspired
02:11:46 by him because I made 30 episodes
02:11:48 before I even knew he was
02:11:50 alive and and
02:11:52 or demo people compare you to demo
02:11:54 never seen a demo video funny and talk
02:11:56 about anime and there's no other connection
02:11:58 really I promise if we watch some of his videos
02:12:00 you'd be like why do people compare me to this
02:12:02 this is nothing like my style
02:12:04 yeah you did you both did a video on
02:12:06 bokeh no pico that's okay
02:12:08 that's it I think somebody said he also
02:12:10 did a boon eye sisters but I was too afraid
02:12:12 to watch because I didn't want to steal his jokes on accident
02:12:14 yeah um
02:12:16 like I don't know
02:12:18 I don't really know
02:12:20 what my comedy influences are
02:12:22 you've been quoting a lot of the
02:12:24 widest kids you know I imagine that was an influence
02:12:26 uh yeah yeah
02:12:28 I mean I like their comedy
02:12:30 I don't know if it's really
02:12:32 similar to what I do
02:12:34 I mean not everything I mean
02:12:36 I was influenced by widest kids you know
02:12:38 it's not similar to what I do at all
02:12:40 a lot of just the
02:12:42 just simply the gallon of PCP
02:12:44 skit just that
02:12:46 skit was a huge influence on me and
02:12:48 Victor's sketch comedy before
02:12:50 you know what no I'll take it back I think
02:12:52 Trevor more specifically the leader of the widest
02:12:54 kids you know is a major comedy
02:12:56 influence to me because
02:12:58 you asked earlier what my kind of goal is
02:13:00 with it and the most important thing
02:13:02 to me is to fight against
02:13:04 any form of censorship and I want
02:13:06 I think anything that
02:13:08 can be said like
02:13:10 exercise it and say it
02:13:12 even if it's ridiculous and offensive
02:13:14 we should exercise this right of the freedom of speech
02:13:16 and Trevor Moore
02:13:18 in the first episode of widest kids you know
02:13:20 it ends with a music video called the hitler rap
02:13:22 where he's dressed up as hitler and he's
02:13:24 doing a whole rap about
02:13:26 the third rikin shit and it's like it's really funny
02:13:28 and
02:13:30 a lot of people would say you shouldn't be able to do that
02:13:32 I know they got in trouble once because
02:13:34 they had a music video
02:13:36 that was an instructional guide to children
02:13:38 about how to get rid of their fathers
02:13:40 by framing them for pedophilia
02:13:42 yeah it's called get a new daddy I know every word
02:13:44 yeah that's it's great
02:13:46 it's one of the best skits
02:13:48 it got them in real trouble because people were like
02:13:50 you can't you can't do this
02:13:52 because what if kids actually take it seriously
02:13:54 police would take the old one away in a catty
02:13:56 you can get a new daddy
02:13:58 get a new mommy, new brother, new sister
02:14:00 a new house, a new mommy
02:14:02 so at that point he'd ruined his entire family
02:14:04 and it was getting adopted into a new one
02:14:06 so is there any other
02:14:08 who else would you say
02:14:10 is a big influence on your comedic style
02:14:12 or your approach to comedy
02:14:14 I don't know
02:14:16 shaped the young mind of monkey
02:14:18 everybody knows when I was 11
02:14:20 or no even younger when I was in elementary
02:14:22 school I loved bo bo bo bo bo
02:14:24 I mean that's a satire
02:14:26 and that's what I'm kind of going for
02:14:28 and I liked how random and funny it was
02:14:30 and I
02:14:32 I get really meta a lot
02:14:34 and that's a very meta show
02:14:36 Don Patch is actively trying to become
02:14:38 the main character of the show all the time
02:14:40 and he says it
02:14:42 he's like I want to be the main character
02:14:44 so yeah I guess
02:14:46 I'm influenced by bo bo bo bo
02:14:48 and how meta it is and all that shit
02:14:50 so
02:14:52 I know you're
02:14:54 big into film
02:14:56 yeah
02:14:58 one of the things that I've always had
02:15:00 when it comes to people doing criticism
02:15:02 on a more serious level like with monkey's anime reviews
02:15:04 it's obvious that they're all sort of
02:15:06 irreverent and random and it doesn't matter
02:15:08 how much you know and even on
02:15:10 like my Japanese anime
02:15:12 which is more analytical but it never tries to
02:15:14 put the stuff into the context of anime
02:15:16 it's always just the show
02:15:18 you know and I'm
02:15:20 wondering when you do film analysis
02:15:22 or when you do film reviews with you and
02:15:24 and E-Rage one of the
02:15:26 difficulties I have with the show is that I have
02:15:28 no context
02:15:30 and you're putting these movies into the context of film
02:15:32 like is this movie good or bad
02:15:34 but I don't know what movies you think are good
02:15:36 or bad or things like that
02:15:38 and I'm wondering like
02:15:40 for instance when I watch YMS
02:15:42 do you watch
02:15:44 I love his top 10
02:15:46 of the year lists because
02:15:48 they give you such a clear picture
02:15:50 of his taste that anything
02:15:52 he says about a movie you can just think about
02:15:54 his top 10s and you're like well of course
02:15:56 you wouldn't like a superhero movie
02:15:58 it's just completely outside your genre
02:16:00 you know so
02:16:02 if you started doing movie reviews
02:16:04 like I'm curious like
02:16:06 what context do you have for films and like
02:16:08 how many have you seen how much do you
02:16:10 how how integrated
02:16:12 into the medium are you and would you present
02:16:14 this in your future videos
02:16:16 I think outside of just giving my
02:16:18 hot take with E-Rage I wouldn't
02:16:20 want to do film reviews because I mean
02:16:22 I'm not that knowledgeable
02:16:24 in the field and I don't really
02:16:26 have an established criteria of what makes
02:16:28 a good movie or a bad movie
02:16:30 if I see a movie and I like it I'll say
02:16:32 here's why and if you like these things
02:16:34 you'll like it too so I wouldn't say
02:16:36 it's a deep analysis
02:16:38 I understand why you're frustrated
02:16:40 when you watch it
02:16:42 it's not so much that I'm frustrated is that
02:16:44 I know you seem to care more
02:16:46 about film than other mediums
02:16:48 but it's difficult to tell
02:16:50 how much you care
02:16:52 is it like me with anime
02:16:54 everything and know everything or is it just
02:16:56 like I like going to the movies every week
02:16:58 you know it's probably more the second
02:17:00 one I just I like going to the movies
02:17:02 more than probably 90%
02:17:04 of people is there any
02:17:06 like artists like is there any stuff
02:17:08 that you're really passionately that
02:17:10 you follow like that you
02:17:12 like not not necessarily a medium it could
02:17:14 just be I know you're really big into survivor
02:17:16 yeah like how like
02:17:18 what's your relationship with that kind of
02:17:20 stuff if you had to put together a top
02:17:22 10 list of shit mom monkey cares
02:17:24 about what would be on that top 10 oh my
02:17:26 god
02:17:28 so my Prague music
02:17:30 your Arians your your dream
02:17:32 theaters your
02:17:34 Spock's Beards your transatlantic
02:17:36 I spend most of my time with that
02:17:38 podcast like the biggest
02:17:40 problem the dick show
02:17:42 the flop house that kind
02:17:44 of stuff those are the main ones I've never heard the flop
02:17:46 house it's the
02:17:48 two of the three guys are writers for the
02:17:50 daily show and so they're pretty funny
02:17:52 I mean most of the time and they
02:17:54 they just watched a bad movie
02:17:56 and they talk about it and
02:17:58 I wouldn't recommend it I just know that I
02:18:00 like it okay that's
02:18:02 interesting yeah well because I don't recommend
02:18:04 everything that I like because I know why
02:18:06 I like it and I wouldn't expect other people
02:18:08 to like it for the same reason
02:18:10 so yeah we have the music the
02:18:12 podcast yeah I like watching
02:18:14 movies probably more than
02:18:16 watching I guess like anime
02:18:18 or TV like I'd rather just watch
02:18:20 a movie but
02:18:22 there are a lot of TV shows I'm really passionate
02:18:24 about like I was huge into Breaking Bad
02:18:26 now I'm big into Fargo and Better Call
02:18:28 Saul a survivor obviously
02:18:30 all I do these days
02:18:32 is pretty much watch old
02:18:34 survivor seasons like just
02:18:36 and binge them all day when I'm not working on stuff
02:18:38 you begin to like big brother
02:18:40 yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna go audition
02:18:42 for big brother in like a week
02:18:44 so you know wish me luck
02:18:46 if I if I disappear and stop making
02:18:48 videos it's because I'm on TV
02:18:50 go turn it on channel 8
02:18:52 I was really fascinated by your
02:18:54 attachment to like reality TV
02:18:56 which most people on the internet
02:18:58 completely because people
02:19:00 don't understand because
02:19:02 I think the problem is they
02:19:04 think it's all on the same level of
02:19:06 like the bachelor which I think
02:19:08 most people watch because it's shit
02:19:10 but survivor is it's
02:19:12 like a completely different genre I wouldn't
02:19:14 even lump it in with the reality
02:19:16 TV like that they think it's all like your real
02:19:18 housewives bullshit
02:19:20 but it's totally not yeah
02:19:22 survivor was kind of the original
02:19:24 the original and the best kind of survivor
02:19:26 is by far the best yeah like way
02:19:28 more product I mean I've seen a lot of it because my mom
02:19:30 is a huge survivor fan and like
02:19:32 yeah the level of production
02:19:34 is way above all the other ones but it's
02:19:36 still not real
02:19:38 like what do you mean by not
02:19:40 real like a lot of scripted
02:19:42 not scripted but there's
02:19:44 a lot of staging there's a lot of like
02:19:46 when you know behind the scenes the magic's
02:19:48 kind of gone you know where it's like
02:19:50 but it's still a competition at
02:19:52 its heart like it's no different from a game of
02:19:54 baseball there's a lot of things that are organized but
02:19:56 it's still a game it's about the
02:19:58 I mean they put together a good narrative out of
02:20:00 it you know sure it's not a lot of
02:20:02 editing but it's just not real in the sense
02:20:04 of like oh this is all like exactly what
02:20:06 it's like for sure it's because there's like
02:20:08 40 stage hands to
02:20:10 immediately off camera at any given time
02:20:12 the problem is they have to edit
02:20:14 three days of footage into
02:20:16 a 40 minute narrative so sometimes
02:20:18 I mean in the editing room you have no choice
02:20:20 if you want to have a cohesive narrative you have to do
02:20:22 things like that but at the end
02:20:24 of the day it's still a real game that's being played
02:20:26 and you're watching like
02:20:28 these Don Brackens manipulate people
02:20:30 and become the king of the island
02:20:32 and it's really really interesting to me
02:20:34 and I love watching the strategy talk
02:20:36 I don't care so much for the competitions
02:20:38 I don't care for like the petty fights over stupid
02:20:40 shit I like to watch those
02:20:42 strategic masterminds the puppet masters
02:20:44 who rise and use their intellect
02:20:46 to just rule over
02:20:48 everybody else and win the game and that's
02:20:50 why I love it it was a great
02:20:52 quote from Dick Masterson
02:20:54 I don't know the I don't remember exactly what he said
02:20:56 or how he phrased it but it was on a recent
02:20:58 podcast where he was talking
02:21:00 about people complaining that the show is like
02:21:02 just you know using gossip
02:21:04 and like trying to like oh it's all guys
02:21:06 he's like oh I'm so sorry
02:21:08 that I have an hour of narrative
02:21:10 content with a gigantic
02:21:12 viewership every week that like that we spun
02:21:14 a human drama that's
02:21:16 deeply interesting to lots of people
02:21:18 that happens to be based in reality
02:21:20 I was like yeah like that's why I'm watching
02:21:22 the dick show is like I want
02:21:24 the goss I want the drama
02:21:26 because it is deeply interesting
02:21:28 to see this like character portrait
02:21:30 of Maddox as this this
02:21:32 this man whose whole identity
02:21:34 is shifting in the eyes of people
02:21:36 to like recognize him in a different way
02:21:38 it's so if this was all scripted it would be like
02:21:40 oh whatever it's not a drama but the fact that
02:21:42 it's actually happening in real life is what makes
02:21:44 the whole drama of the biggest problem
02:21:46 so great and and it would be
02:21:48 so like people people
02:21:50 are saying like oh you're you're just you know taking advantage
02:21:52 of the goss but it's like you need
02:21:54 someone who can spin that and make it interesting
02:21:56 and Dick's willingness to
02:21:58 withhold so much information
02:22:00 and dish it out at just the right moments
02:22:02 and to keep finding ways to spin it
02:22:04 and to get more people involved like
02:22:06 he's managing it perfectly and that's
02:22:08 why it's such a good show it's great
02:22:10 like if if this if the exact same thing
02:22:12 happened with me I would have made
02:22:14 a five-hour podcast explaining
02:22:16 everything in the next day
02:22:18 you know like I would have laid out every single
02:22:20 thing that happened between me and Maddox
02:22:22 and the show would have been over
02:22:24 and dick you know looked at it and went this can
02:22:26 be a story and and the fact that it keeps
02:22:28 that Maddox keeps doing
02:22:30 things to make it keep going is why
02:22:32 and why it remains that interesting
02:22:34 even on the first episode of the dick
02:22:36 show like we're all anxiously waiting
02:22:38 to hear what happened and he doesn't even
02:22:40 like really mention it until the last ten minutes
02:22:42 and like what the fuck like I was on the edge of my seat
02:22:44 the whole time there it is like he knows how
02:22:46 to how to hold a story
02:22:48 yeah and
02:22:50 yeah I know you you've said that you
02:22:52 you've kind of fallen out with the dick
02:22:54 show because it's just too much it's
02:22:56 it used to be like an hour long
02:22:58 and now it's like two and a half
02:23:00 hours long the funny thing about it is that he's
02:23:02 he was saying that like it's that long
02:23:04 because of the fact that people are
02:23:06 paying for it and he's like I want to give them
02:23:08 a lot you know like people are paying all
02:23:10 this money to get this this big chunk of show
02:23:12 every week and like
02:23:14 on some on one hand I appreciate
02:23:16 the other hand if I am at all busy
02:23:18 that week yeah I am not going to be able
02:23:20 to make the like I mostly watch it
02:23:22 in like seven-hour marathons when I find
02:23:24 it like when I find the chance
02:23:26 and I watch it I have the
02:23:28 video so I'll sit back
02:23:30 on the couch and just like drink beer
02:23:32 and watch it all day when I finally
02:23:34 catch up yeah that's the problem I'm into right now
02:23:36 is that I'm like three episodes behind
02:23:38 so that's it's going to take me
02:23:40 seven hours to catch up and I was like
02:23:42 I don't know if it's worth it I don't know
02:23:44 but I just I skipped two episodes
02:23:46 and jumped into the mad cucks one because I saw
02:23:48 he was on there and I think that's a great
02:23:50 idea to have a straight up parody
02:23:52 of Maddox there on the show
02:23:54 and and they're gonna they did a
02:23:56 recording of a full biggest problem
02:23:58 biggest problem episode which I'm greatly
02:24:00 looking forward to. I can't wait for that.
02:24:02 April Fool's Day.
02:24:04 Yeah it's going to be great
02:24:06 but um
02:24:08 anyway I don't want to talk too much about
02:24:10 other no other other creators that
02:24:12 our audience might not follow but this is
02:24:14 it's kind of integral to how we
02:24:16 like why I wanted to contact you is that
02:24:18 you knew these these guys
02:24:20 you know stuff like that because like in the
02:24:22 movie me and me and Jesse
02:24:24 uh and who else
02:24:26 me and Jesse in particular
02:24:28 are really big fans of biggest problems so we've been
02:24:30 following all this as it was happening
02:24:32 and stuff and I think yeah we don't I was
02:24:34 already in contact with you when the breakup
02:24:36 happened I think definitely
02:24:38 yeah and then and I kind of message you like
02:24:40 uh monkey and you know like
02:24:42 we weren't like close yet but I was like
02:24:44 I don't know how to reach out to this guy
02:24:46 to tell him like what's going on do you see
02:24:48 this happening you know yeah I noticed you
02:24:50 like a couple comments sections and then I think
02:24:52 you probably found out that I liked it
02:24:54 either from the mumkeys anime reviews video
02:24:56 or in one of my nuzlocke in my nuzlocke
02:24:58 I talked about it too but uh
02:25:00 I think it's interesting you asked me
02:25:02 like what are my the 10 most important things
02:25:04 to me and it sort of fell apart because like I said
02:25:06 me as a person I'm not interesting
02:25:08 but then once we start talking about something
02:25:10 that we both like then we pick up the
02:25:12 conversation again well I think I mean if
02:25:14 you I don't think I'm
02:25:16 interesting but I have
02:25:18 interesting ways of interpreting things and I just
02:25:20 will always
02:25:22 talk about them like like if
02:25:24 my uh vlogs were just
02:25:26 literally like digibro a day
02:25:28 in the life it would be a story of me making
02:25:30 the vlog I'm making which
02:25:32 has been some of them
02:25:34 uh that's kind of the joke
02:25:36 in uh Insomnia Analysis 3 is that
02:25:38 I keep um I
02:25:40 hit record and then I set up the shot
02:25:42 so like every shot starts with
02:25:44 me setting it up and like moving the camera
02:25:46 like dragging the tripod across the room
02:25:48 and stuff like very meta yeah
02:25:50 and just because
02:25:52 yeah like it's it's not
02:25:54 that you are interesting it's that you present
02:25:56 things in an interesting way which I
02:25:58 feel like I need
02:26:00 the cloak of monkey to do that because
02:26:02 I I think I took all
02:26:04 the most interesting parts of my personality
02:26:06 and then put them
02:26:08 on like you know
02:26:10 I increased them ten fold with the character
02:26:12 so now when I go back to just like
02:26:14 talking as me it's like oh this is
02:26:16 a boring version of this well
02:26:18 we've been doing a podcast for almost three hours
02:26:20 yeah yeah it's been fairly entertaining
02:26:22 I would hope so I mean I think
02:26:24 I think there's always like
02:26:26 it's kind of the reason I don't ever want to
02:26:28 lose the main channel of digibro like you were
02:26:30 saying that I could probably subsist off after dark
02:26:32 and that's true but to me
02:26:34 um like
02:26:36 the second I do that I'm just
02:26:38 I'm just some guy
02:26:40 you know like it's the the
02:26:42 partifice of that I am creating
02:26:44 something that I consider to be
02:26:46 bigger than myself
02:26:48 is how I'm able to also
02:26:50 have this off-air persona
02:26:52 like if it was just
02:26:54 digibro talks about being digibro it would
02:26:56 quickly become an uraburo
02:26:58 to start eating itself and I would
02:27:00 it's like a celebrity that's only famous for being famous
02:27:02 exactly like I want
02:27:04 there to be that like the
02:27:06 reason you're interested in me
02:27:08 is because you got in through this
02:27:10 other thing you know you had to come from somewhere
02:27:12 and like yeah I mean after dark
02:27:14 has a lot of interesting vlogs that on their own
02:27:16 like you said are better than the main channel videos
02:27:18 pretty damn good and are not necessarily
02:27:20 uh
02:27:22 like it's not all just me being
02:27:24 me you know it's not all the digibro
02:27:26 show um but like to me
02:27:28 it's important that that exists but I think
02:27:30 that that allows for this other
02:27:32 life to happen that's why I'm interested in
02:27:34 um you know countdown to suicide
02:27:36 like those videos wouldn't be interesting on their own
02:27:38 but they also
02:27:40 are interesting like just because
02:27:42 monkey exists and I want to know
02:27:44 what that guy is about I'm like what
02:27:46 what drives someone to make this video
02:27:48 that I thought was hilarious like what is there
02:27:50 to that guy you know
02:27:52 and I think that inherently makes you
02:27:54 interesting even though you wouldn't be
02:27:56 if not for that content you know
02:27:58 much like the
02:28:00 the anime fights podcast thing
02:28:02 uh I cannot watch
02:28:04 the countdown to suicide videos
02:28:06 and I don't watch them I record them upload
02:28:08 them and then I try to pretend it never happened
02:28:10 other than reading the comments I
02:28:12 can't stand to hear those
02:28:14 things I said about myself
02:28:16 there's a lot of my uh after dark vlogs
02:28:18 that I can't watch back like I will
02:28:20 when I when I make it
02:28:22 I'll watch it back like to check to see
02:28:24 if it's like coherent and I'll enjoy
02:28:26 it but then if I go back like a week later
02:28:28 it's just because the
02:28:30 because it's not written all the phrasing
02:28:32 is just so bad
02:28:34 like it's all it's every point I make
02:28:36 is something that the more I think about it
02:28:38 I realize how I could have said it better
02:28:40 you know and then you listen back and it's just like
02:28:42 ugh this
02:28:44 this is why no one understands you
02:28:46 because you phrase everything so fucking incoherently
02:28:48 um and of course
02:28:50 you know I have to like watch myself be drunk
02:28:52 and like walk around the room screaming
02:28:54 now that's fun that's fun
02:28:56 I'll watch any video of me being drunk
02:28:58 I think it's always a blast
02:29:00 and at the god of war rant where I just scream
02:29:02 for 30 minutes
02:29:04 that's a little difficult to get
02:29:06 to again
02:29:08 now that's the kind of video I would watch again
02:29:10 for sure the ones where I get like super
02:29:12 serious and talk about
02:29:14 I've been depressed
02:29:16 for five years I don't want to hear it
02:29:18 I don't want to hear it you definitely can't sit through
02:29:20 the decompression chambers oh yeah I imagine
02:29:22 but particularly
02:29:24 the last one where it was the one that
02:29:26 was like the
02:29:28 that's a good one when you talk shit about yourself
02:29:30 but also talk highly of yourself
02:29:32 at the same time that one was so hard
02:29:34 to both finish and
02:29:36 get through because I had listened to it back
02:29:38 like because I was so unsure of it
02:29:40 I kept listening back to the segments
02:29:42 and every time I would just be like
02:29:44 ugh
02:29:46 I can't believe I'm releasing this
02:29:48 I encouraged you to release that a lot because I wanted
02:29:50 to hear it and I mean a lot
02:29:52 of people I think
02:29:54 ultimately enjoyed it and got something out of it
02:29:56 but like there was not never a point
02:29:58 that I didn't regret it like I released it
02:30:00 and most of like I didn't want to
02:30:02 hear people's reactions to it and like
02:30:04 every reaction I heard I was like yeah I knew this
02:30:06 was coming I knew that was coming
02:30:08 this is not I don't want
02:30:10 this to exist I don't want to do this again
02:30:12 let's not have it be this way
02:30:14 is that why that show is cancelled
02:30:16 partly I mean that
02:30:18 and I just got busy after that and
02:30:20 like yeah
02:30:22 I lost interest in the format
02:30:24 you know like I'd rather just
02:30:26 I've done a few things that are similar
02:30:28 to decompression chambers on my reddit
02:30:30 it's just a matter of there's a lot of stuff
02:30:32 that I want to exist now that I don't want
02:30:34 to be public you know have you ever had
02:30:36 like that that's I mean you
02:30:38 you separate your channel so surely on some level
02:30:40 like countdown to suicide is
02:30:42 meant to be hidden
02:30:44 like I mean I it's
02:30:46 in every single description
02:30:48 of my videos when you list all my channels
02:30:50 it's like I mean my reddit is always listed
02:30:52 too but I'm not like out
02:30:54 like if I posted something there it's because
02:30:56 I want I want to
02:30:58 hear what like my closest fans have to
02:31:00 say but I don't necessarily
02:31:02 want everyone's reaction
02:31:04 to it like I don't want this to be
02:31:06 like not that I'm hiding it from
02:31:08 everybody but that it's not meant
02:31:10 to be seen by a wide audience
02:31:12 like like my book like that
02:31:14 book was six years old great book
02:31:16 and written you know like it was written by a
02:31:18 different me and if I release that on
02:31:20 after dark I just don't want
02:31:22 to have to read people like criticizing
02:31:24 the book as if I just wrote it you know
02:31:26 it's like no this is an ancient piece of work
02:31:28 that barely is related to me anymore
02:31:30 I just wanted it to exist out there
02:31:32 and as long as a few people can get something
02:31:34 out of it that's fine you know like
02:31:36 so do you do you think that you
02:31:38 have any kind of inclination to like
02:31:40 release stuff that is deliberately
02:31:42 not for the public
02:31:44 not really I think
02:31:46 if if for some bizarre reason
02:31:48 monkeys count down to suicide blew up
02:31:50 and it had like half a million subs
02:31:52 and it was my biggest channel I'd be like
02:31:54 okay that's fine I guess people like this
02:31:56 I'd be I'd accept that
02:31:58 I think any of us would accept that
02:32:00 that's cool like I wasn't trying to hide this
02:32:02 I don't care if people see it I mean
02:32:04 I don't try to make
02:32:06 things that I don't want like thousands of
02:32:08 people to see I mean you seem to be
02:32:10 when you were you were a little upset
02:32:12 when all the normies came to the channel after
02:32:14 I shouted it out on the PC
02:32:16 that's mostly a meme
02:32:18 you know normies get the fuck out
02:32:20 yeah
02:32:22 your fans are always
02:32:24 mad when you get more
02:32:26 yeah and they're not being sarcastic most
02:32:28 of them I think they actually want the normies
02:32:30 to get the fuck out but it's not like
02:32:32 I'm gonna change my content style
02:32:34 because there's more people watching it
02:32:36 like they can just choose that it's too edgy
02:32:38 for them and they can leave yeah that's the natural
02:32:40 flow of things
02:32:42 um
02:32:44 alright well I've run through
02:32:46 most of the questions I had thought of
02:32:48 but that was a good 45 minutes
02:32:50 we still need another 15 minutes of content
02:32:52 does that include
02:32:54 all the times we weren't recording
02:32:56 because we were in the bathroom and stuff
02:32:58 yeah it was only like 10 minutes that we were short on
02:33:00 well we don't have to go to 3 hours
02:33:02 I mean it's no big deal to me
02:33:04 was there anything else you'd want
02:33:06 people to understand about you or anything
02:33:08 anything else you would say
02:33:10 about your content where it's going
02:33:12 why it exists
02:33:14 so I could
02:33:16 I could talk
02:33:18 I guess about some of my ideas for
02:33:20 the future things on Mumkey Jones
02:33:22 because some people seem a little
02:33:24 cautious about me saying
02:33:26 Mumkey's anime review is ending
02:33:28 they're like oh god no
02:33:30 I have to un-pledge my Patreon
02:33:32 he's gonna stop American videos
02:33:34 it's not true at all
02:33:36 I still want to make the same exact thing
02:33:38 only just drop the joke about anime
02:33:40 and drop all the Uncle Alex jokes
02:33:42 it really has been fleshed out
02:33:44 as much as I think it can be
02:33:46 so I'm ready to get away from that
02:33:48 so some ideas I have
02:33:50 I said the top 10
02:33:52 isms thing
02:33:54 I want to do some serious videos
02:33:56 like my top 5 videos
02:33:58 that are my favorite on YouTube
02:34:00 and then other things I want to do
02:34:02 I think it'd be fun
02:34:04 every now and then did do another
02:34:06 anime review
02:34:08 of like an anime but I just don't call it that
02:34:10 I would just it'd be like
02:34:12 you know
02:34:14 a soul leader and then instead of Mumkey's
02:34:16 anime reviews it would say Mumkey Jones
02:34:18 I think that should be like
02:34:20 the new subtitle and I also
02:34:22 want to do a series called
02:34:24 Mumkey 101 where the
02:34:26 title of the video is like a big question
02:34:28 and then I explore the question
02:34:30 and try to answer it and some examples
02:34:32 I have are can women
02:34:34 be forever alone
02:34:36 and I would go through
02:34:38 edits of like forever alone women
02:34:40 versus you posted some screenshots
02:34:42 for that which were hilarious
02:34:44 because they were so fucking
02:34:46 like I'm going to compare
02:34:48 the difference between what the forever
02:34:50 alone women sub is
02:34:52 and what the normal forever alone
02:34:54 one is and then like
02:34:56 compare that to the incels who are
02:34:58 actually forever alone
02:35:00 so just exploring questions like that and having fun
02:35:02 another one I have which
02:35:04 you and me did
02:35:06 we've recorded a podcast last night
02:35:08 I don't know if that'll be out yet or when it's coming out
02:35:10 I don't know
02:35:12 it's going on my channel it probably won't be out until like
02:35:14 the end of March
02:35:16 but another question I want to try to answer
02:35:18 is do Muslims deserve rights
02:35:20 which is
02:35:22 it seems like a joke question but then when you
02:35:24 get into the stick of it
02:35:26 yeah there's a lot to be said on the subject
02:35:28 obviously they deserve human rights
02:35:30 but then when you get down to the nitty gritty of
02:35:32 you find out that subways
02:35:34 some of them are banning all pork products
02:35:36 now to adhere to their
02:35:38 Muslim customers like
02:35:40 is that a right that they deserve because of their imaginary
02:35:42 friend I think not
02:35:44 well I mean if it's good for business for
02:35:46 Subway to do it then of course they should do it
02:35:48 yeah but then you're like the poor white guy who lives
02:35:50 in the newly enriched community
02:35:52 who can no longer get bacon on his sub
02:35:54 like is that fair for him
02:35:56 just because of this imaginary friend bullshit
02:35:58 go to another restaurant
02:36:00 yeah well whatever
02:36:02 so I'm gonna do some research on that
02:36:04 and see how many
02:36:06 communities are being culturally enriched
02:36:08 and all the rights
02:36:10 that are being changed
02:36:12 so more controversial
02:36:14 stuff that will make me lose thousands of subs
02:36:16 every upload well I love that you're
02:36:18 taking that even-handed
02:36:20 approach of like everyone gets
02:36:22 shit on everybody no one's safe
02:36:24 even me especially me the Christians
02:36:26 aren't safe the Muslims aren't safe the Jews
02:36:28 aren't safe and now the atheists aren't safe
02:36:30 I'm coming I'm gonna go to the atheism
02:36:32 plus subreddit and just oh you all
02:36:34 think you know so much
02:36:36 you just think
02:36:38 no proof that God
02:36:40 doesn't exist and yet you're
02:36:42 so convinced
02:36:44 just have fun with it
02:36:46 yeah and pick on some
02:36:48 some some like edgy teen atheism
02:36:50 obviously lots of fedora jokes
02:36:52 just easy stuff yet
02:36:54 I think it's it's very important
02:36:56 that I think the problem with comedy
02:36:58 these days is that everybody
02:37:00 is getting way too political with it
02:37:02 but they're choosing a side
02:37:04 I think if you're gonna get political with it
02:37:06 attack everybody don't just
02:37:08 choose one side I mean that's what's so great
02:37:10 about George Carlin is that his politics
02:37:12 were just like I
02:37:14 fuck everybody all of you are wrong about
02:37:16 everything you know I'm the only one who
02:37:18 makes any sense in this world
02:37:20 you know which is why
02:37:22 if Jesse
02:37:24 I always compare to Carlin and like everybody
02:37:26 compares Louis C.K. to Carlin but
02:37:28 no fuck Louis C.K.
02:37:30 I think he used to be but not anymore
02:37:32 just going just that
02:37:34 yeah the attitude of like
02:37:36 you've all wronged me
02:37:38 like whatever system
02:37:40 you've all created I'm not happy
02:37:42 and it's because I'm in this system and you're all
02:37:44 a part of this system so you have wronged me
02:37:46 you know
02:37:48 it's sort of the mentality
02:37:50 it's important to be even handed with your hatred
02:37:52 because it's not
02:37:54 discrimination if you discriminate against every
02:37:56 group equally it just
02:37:58 it might seem like I attack
02:38:00 feminists and like Muslims and stuff
02:38:02 more often but it's just because they have more
02:38:04 out there to make fun of and because they're
02:38:06 the ones who are being more defended now
02:38:08 yeah and they're the ones who are causing
02:38:10 the most problems in my mind
02:38:12 I mean it's
02:38:14 it's like
02:38:16 you know I feel like
02:38:18 you're trying to keep the scales from getting
02:38:20 tipped like
02:38:22 when like it's getting
02:38:24 harder and harder to make fun of Muslims
02:38:26 right now
02:38:28 even though it should be they should be made fun
02:38:30 of just as much as Christians and anybody else
02:38:32 it should all be equal and so the harder
02:38:34 it gets to make fun of them the more you
02:38:36 have to kind of push back and go no it's still
02:38:38 okay
02:38:40 I want my bacon out of the subway
02:38:42 everybody still deserves this
02:38:44 I have to pee again
02:38:46 I'm a fucking
02:38:48 I've had like four bottles of water I don't know why I keep drinking it
02:38:50 he's a thirsty dude
02:38:54 you haven't had to go at all
02:38:56 well I went

02:39:16 your whole body is sweaty
02:39:18 you sweat when you like record

02:39:22 I think like my whole body is just like

02:39:26 let's do it let's all focus all the energy
02:39:28 up on that brain
02:39:30 and even then it doesn't work
02:39:36 I can't wait till we can get drunk and record funny
02:39:38 let's plays
02:39:40 let's do it already I'm so sick of being
02:39:42 a serious boy
02:39:44 time to be a funny boy
02:39:46 are we gonna have dinner?
02:39:48 what do we do for dinner?
02:39:52 I really want like a vegetable
02:39:54 if we're gonna get dinner we should do it way before
02:39:56 yeah we should do it immediately after
02:39:58 this podcast before we start drinking
02:40:00 I've been like
02:40:02 back and forth like should I
02:40:04 drink a golden monkey now or wait till
02:40:06 we're after the podcast
02:40:08 I mean a sheep can drive us
02:40:10 so alright I guess I'll
02:40:12 I'll leave us out
02:40:14 on a big question
02:40:16 okay let's say
02:40:18 is there like a question that you ask everybody in every interview
02:40:20 no there's nothing like that
02:40:22 let's say that tomorrow
02:40:24 um
02:40:26 um monkey jones one of your videos
02:40:28 goes viral again
02:40:30 do I get to pick which one?
02:40:32 sure
02:40:36 that's top 10 suicide methods
02:40:38 I know that's your favorite
02:40:40 yeah let's go with that one that's fine
02:40:42 this goes viral
02:40:44 spikes up to 50,000
02:40:46 subscribe
02:40:48 because finally it's a video that everyone understood
02:40:50 they checked out the rest of your channel
02:40:52 they realized it was more of the same
02:40:54 which has been happening on a micro level
02:40:56 like the last week
02:40:58 I think mostly because of you
02:41:00 because I've got an influx of comments on every
02:41:02 video now instead of just like the most recent one
02:41:04 and they're all saying whoa these videos are great
02:41:06 dude this whole channel's gold
02:41:08 I'm like yeah you're right
02:41:10 you're fucking right they are
02:41:12 we did it
02:41:14 so let's say you get
02:41:16 you're suddenly 50,000 subs
02:41:18 hell yeah
02:41:20 patreon jumps up
02:41:22 you're making a thousand dollars a month
02:41:24 fuck
02:41:26 my goal on patreon says a thousand dollars
02:41:28 this is my full time job
02:41:30 so we'll see if that happens
02:41:32 so you reach a thousand dollars a month
02:41:34 you get 50,000 subs
02:41:36 it looks like things are going to keep growing
02:41:38 it's going to just do the same thing I'm doing now
02:41:40 I don't know how I would switch it up
02:41:42 I mean if they subscribe because I like
02:41:44 what I'm doing so far so I just
02:41:46 keep doing it I guess
02:41:48 do you think you would
02:41:50 let's expand it out
02:41:52 let's say monkey
02:41:54 this happens you live off of monkey jones for a little while
02:41:56 you're goddamn right
02:41:58 monkey explodes again
02:42:00 now you're making 10,000 dollars a month
02:42:02 fuck
02:42:04 what do monkey do
02:42:06 I don't know what are you expecting
02:42:08 what do you do if you have a ton of expendable income
02:42:10 and all the time in the world to spend it
02:42:14 cause like for me so much of what
02:42:16 I've been doing is on the basis
02:42:18 of the fact that I can make
02:42:20 if it
02:42:22 really came down to it I could make
02:42:24 two videos in a month and that's enough
02:42:26 if I'm just worried about sustaining myself
02:42:28 like no advancement
02:42:30 or anything like just paying the rent
02:42:32 and eating
02:42:34 you know
02:42:36 you could even make one video a month
02:42:38 if Davoo didn't edit it definitely
02:42:40 one
02:42:42 so for the rest of the month I can do whatever the fuck I want
02:42:44 so if monkey jones
02:42:46 is on a timetable now
02:42:48 where you don't have to have a video every week
02:42:50 trying to grow the channel
02:42:52 because you're already grown
02:42:54 and you're making a guaranteed amount of month
02:42:56 that is in excess of how much you need
02:42:58 do you keep
02:43:00 doing weekly videos all the time
02:43:02 keeping to the same schedule
02:43:04 or do you try to expand
02:43:06 or do you try to do something different from the main channel videos
02:43:08 where do you put this extra money you've made
02:43:10 I think I continue
02:43:12 to do the
02:43:14 a video weekly or bi-weekly as my job
02:43:16 but then now that this dream is accomplished
02:43:18 I go back to the original dream
02:43:20 that we all had back in the day
02:43:22 you had it too of being a writer
02:43:24 cause at the end of the day
02:43:26 in my mind that's the high arch
02:43:28 that's what I want to do
02:43:30 because you've written a book
02:43:32 I believe this book could be it
02:43:34 if I just get that lucky break
02:43:36 of somebody in the industry
02:43:38 who wants to give it a chance
02:43:40 which has not happened yet
02:43:42 and I'm losing faith
02:43:44 if you had the time
02:43:46 would you just write another
02:43:48 if you were making enough money off your channel
02:43:50 that you knew you didn't need
02:43:52 any regular job anytime soon
02:43:54 are you just going to go full in on writing the book
02:43:56 when you're not doing the channel
02:43:58 what's the fucking book
02:44:00 yeah well I think that's a great answer
02:44:02 cause it's something that
02:44:04 I think about a lot because of the fact
02:44:06 I guess nobody thinks about this until they've made it
02:44:08 but I got to that point
02:44:10 in November
02:44:12 where I said holy shit
02:44:14 as long as I write four scripts at the start of the month
02:44:16 and give them all to DeVoo
02:44:18 I can do whatever I want for the rest of the month
02:44:20 I can make any dream project I've dreamed of
02:44:22 when's that book coming did you
02:44:24 yeah good question
02:44:26 well a little thing
02:44:28 happened where January
02:44:30 rolled around and I wrote out this huge schedule
02:44:32 of all the videos I was going to make
02:44:34 that were going to come out at certain dates
02:44:36 and dates in January and I was going to expand
02:44:38 the channel and blow it up
02:44:40 and then it would leave me with all this free time
02:44:42 to work on a book
02:44:44 and then Radcon 2 happened
02:44:46 all of it went out the window
02:44:48 and then I broke you as a human being
02:44:50 yeah I've been depressed
02:44:52 so
02:44:54 that's Radcon for you
02:44:56 yeah
02:44:58 it wasn't so much Radcon
02:45:00 well it was Radcon's fault
02:45:02 nevermind
02:45:04 what am I trying to defend you
02:45:06 I don't know those Radcon boys
02:45:08 they sure do make me depressed too
02:45:10 I guess that's what I meant to say
02:45:12 it's not any of their fault
02:45:14 it's the event itself and the time that it took out of my life
02:45:16 let's just say it was Ben's fault
02:45:18 yeah why not
02:45:20 I want to end this interview by saying fuck Ben
02:45:22 let's wrap it up so I can say fuck Ben
02:45:24 alright um
02:45:26 subscribe to Monkey Jones
02:45:28 subscribe to Monkey Jones 2
02:45:30 we've got a ton of shitposts coming
02:45:32 like we have recorded
02:45:34 probably 30
02:45:36 shitposts to be released one a day
02:45:38 for the next month
02:45:40 for the month of April probably
02:45:42 as well as
02:45:44 a Let's Play
02:45:46 that will be on your Let's Play channel
02:45:48 Monkey's
02:45:50 Gaming Expedition
02:45:52 we actually did a full Nuzlocke
02:45:54 last night we recorded a full Nuzlocke
02:45:56 we stayed up all night
02:45:58 drinking beer and recording
02:46:00 a full Nuzlocke
02:46:02 at hyper speed
02:46:04 and we did the whole thing
02:46:06 one of the most impressive things I've ever seen in my life
02:46:08 I think so and with Victor
02:46:10 you and I also did some
02:46:12 I guess Vincent I should say we did some Let's Plays too
02:46:14 we recorded like three episodes of Let's Play stuff
02:46:16 that will be on Digi Bros
02:46:18 yeah that will be on Digi Bros
02:46:20 and me and Monkey are going to start doing
02:46:22 podcasts together that's right I hope you guys like it
02:46:24 we didn't do as much prep as we should have
02:46:26 but I think it's a good pilot episode
02:46:28 yeah and if it's successful
02:46:30 maybe it'll
02:46:32 I would really love it if we just became a podcast
02:46:34 in many ways I would rather do
02:46:36 podcasts than anything
02:46:38 I'm doing right now
02:46:40 one hour comedy podcast a week
02:46:42 sounds like the dream
02:46:44 I'm so jealous of Dick
02:46:46 is it what we should all aspire to be
02:46:48 he has a successful book
02:46:50 and this podcast are you kidding me
02:46:52 I was having
02:46:54 I was talking to Jesse about this the other day
02:46:56 what I admire the most about Dick is that he's
02:46:58 proven that you can be hugely
02:47:00 successful on the internet without
02:47:02 participating in the internet
02:47:04 which is what I think me and Jesse both dream of
02:47:06 is escaping the internet
02:47:08 a lot of people don't understand that because a lot of people live on the
02:47:10 like are younger than us and grew up with the internet
02:47:12 always being there I mean that was kind of me
02:47:14 and to me growing up
02:47:16 the internet was always shunned
02:47:18 as a place for freaks and weirdos
02:47:20 I was on it that's why I wanted to go on it
02:47:22 I've been on since 2001
02:47:24 but I've always seen it as
02:47:26 this is not what you're supposed to be doing
02:47:28 supposed to be out there living life
02:47:30 old people are fucking dumb
02:47:32 but it's ingrained in your mind
02:47:34 and I've got all these memories of having friends
02:47:36 having fun
02:47:38 what was it like
02:47:40 my best friend deleted my viral video
02:47:42 yeah
02:47:44 I don't know what friends are
02:47:46 I would have killed him for that
02:47:48 I would literally have fucking killed him
02:47:50 one day my revenge will be complete
02:47:52 when I look at Dick I'm like this is a dude
02:47:54 who only interacts with the internet
02:47:56 as much as he wants to
02:47:58 and otherwise is able to be a man
02:48:00 about town and have real relationships
02:48:02 he's like the CEO of a company
02:48:04 it doesn't even need any of the money
02:48:06 does not need any of the dick show's money
02:48:08 puts it all back into the dick show
02:48:10 other than buying his house
02:48:12 which is obviously a huge benefit
02:48:14 that's very important for the show
02:48:16 you can't have those goddamn apartment neighbors
02:48:18 so
02:48:20 he's
02:48:22 definitely living the dream of
02:48:24 when I look at him I think
02:48:26 man I need to get out of here because
02:48:28 it's not a matter that I'm not successful enough
02:48:30 to have what Dick has
02:48:32 I'm not living my life right
02:48:34 I think we should all aspire to be dicknested
02:48:36 in every different way
02:48:38 he's the perfect man
02:48:40 he's my idol, he's my hero
02:48:42 back around episode 60
02:48:44 of Biggest Problem
02:48:46 I got on the Biggest Problem subreddit
02:48:48 and I posted like a shower thought
02:48:50 I said
02:48:52 childhood is thinking Maddox is the genius
02:48:54 but adulthood is realizing it's dick
02:48:56 and everybody down voted me
02:48:58 they thought I was wrong
02:49:00 because that was back when everybody still praised Maddox
02:49:02 and Dick was like just a derpy co-host
02:49:04 that was the
02:49:06 the parabolic arc that me and Jesse
02:49:08 both followed watching the Biggest Problem
02:49:10 is that in the beginning
02:49:12 Dick seems like the asshole because
02:49:14 he was playing up the comedy and the character
02:49:16 but then once, because Maddox took the arguing
02:49:18 so seriously
02:49:20 then Dick started taking the argument more seriously
02:49:22 that's when you realize, wait a minute, Dick's the only one
02:49:24 who actually makes any sense
02:49:26 Dick's the smarter one, he's like a normal dude
02:49:28 and by the time you get past episode 50
02:49:30 consistently Dick is way
02:49:32 blowing Maddox the fuck out
02:49:34 oh my god, Dick's my hero
02:49:36 I think that's a huge reason why
02:49:38 Maddox wanted Dick off the show
02:49:40 because he was upstaging him so much
02:49:42 towards the end
02:49:44 Dick said that he was saying
02:49:46 I feel like it's gonna get this way for Rucka
02:49:48 he's probably in the mind state I was towards the end of the show
02:49:50 which is that I have to have this show
02:49:52 end before it becomes apparent that this is just
02:49:54 me beating up on an autistic guy
02:49:56 that's all Rucka is really doing
02:49:58 he was really concerned
02:50:00 that's what it was gonna turn into
02:50:02 that's exactly what it was
02:50:04 well everybody that's been
02:50:06 three hours of
02:50:08 man I hope you made it through all of that shit
02:50:10 of Mumkey's
02:50:12 interview
02:50:14 hopefully this will mean
02:50:16 the interview series is coming back
02:50:18 I still have never interviewed Nate
02:50:20 you haven't done Ben have you
