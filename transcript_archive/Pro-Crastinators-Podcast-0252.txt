00:00:00 I'm supposed to be working right now, I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm not working, I'm doing nothing, my dick I'm jerking, myself I'm suiting, I am an asshole, I am a stupid, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I
00:00:30 got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick,
00:00:50 I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got a dick, I got
00:00:58 couple times. Maybe maybe had a larger health bar. Maybe CEO
00:01:03 shouldn't make all this money. If that's all they do is
00:01:06 welcome. No, they're welcome. Welcome everybody to the Amazon
00:01:13 Prime podcast. I'm your host, Jeff Bezos. I just made $20
00:01:18 million in the time it took me to say that sentence.
00:01:20 They're in a lot of zoom meetings, though. It's it's rough.
00:01:26 The life of a CEO. It really is. You don't understand. You
00:01:29 couldn't. You can't even jack off during them. Though they
00:01:34 can't. They can't. Yeah. They can't jack off because they
00:01:37 have their like hired whores sucking their dicks. I mean,
00:01:40 they can't. They can't. It's just a little risky, but like
00:01:44 that kind of makes it harder though. These guys are getting
00:01:49 off in ways that we can only dream of. We could never
00:01:51 understand the release. Well, we used to be able to not
00:01:55 understand. Now, now we know all about it. We know exactly
00:01:59 how they jacked off. We're jacking under the table while
00:02:02 in a call where if anyone discovers what you're doing,
00:02:04 it'll cost you the million dollar yo play deal is just
00:02:09 AK 0.0001% of your net worth. So you're risking really
00:02:13 nothing. Exactly. Exactly.
00:02:17 That's okay. Okay. Am I wrong in thinking 0.001 is still
00:02:22 like a lot of money for like a billion?
00:02:25 It is, but they don't care. I mean, 0.001 of a billion would
00:02:31 be a million, right? It's a thousand. So yeah, something like
00:02:36 that.
00:02:44 Did we start the podcast? I feel like that was the beginning.
00:02:47 No. Well, we can tell we can tell Elia's are to put it in.
00:02:51 Okay. Oh, because the Craig recording will have it.
00:02:57 But I just started Audacity. Do you want to, we can sync now?
00:02:59 Oh, I guess we probably should sync. Recording.
00:03:02 Oh, I wasn't, I was only recording with Craig. I just started
00:03:05 recording right now. Elia's are please and thank you. Make it
00:03:10 work. Just make it work. Fix it in post. Okay. That's what we
00:03:13 pay you for. Just make it work. On the count of three, say
00:03:16 sync. One, two, three, sync. Sink. Sink. One, two, three,
00:03:21 sync. Sink. Sink. Wow, you're like way behind. Am I way behind?
00:03:25 That was some buffering. That was some real buffering.
00:03:27 I think I heard you buffering, Ben. Okay, let's do it again.
00:03:31 Let's do it again. One, two, three, sync. Sink. Sink.
00:03:36 No, that's just how it is today, I guess. Yeah, we're just
00:03:43 getting that high ping over there from over the pond.
00:03:46 Based. Elia's are make it work. I told Elia's are the other day
00:03:53 that thanks for being the editor because you're a good
00:03:56 editor and you indulge my whims and when I say hey, make it a
00:04:00 new background, use new graphics, he just says okay and does
00:04:04 it and it's pretty based of him in my humble opinion. Thanks
00:04:08 Eleazar. Let's give a shout out. Thanks, Eleazar. And thanks, bro.
00:04:16 Okay, a mystery was solved for me this week. Have you noticed
00:04:20 that recent episodes have had a strange hashtag on them?
00:04:26 Oh, I think I know where you're going to go with this already,
00:04:29 but yes, the yeah, the hashtags Eleazar's discord handle,
00:04:34 right? That's what it turned out to be. Yeah, the episodes have
00:04:36 had this hashtag like they've been tagged like hashtag 7532,
00:04:40 I think, and I didn't know what it was. And it turns out it's
00:04:43 Eleazar's discord number, which he like he includes his
00:04:47 discord info in the description, which makes sense. But it was
00:04:50 showing up as a tag on the video and you could see it. So if
00:04:55 anyone noticed that, that's what that was. But he says he's
00:04:59 fixed it in the description and it won't show up anymore. Yeah,
00:05:01 lol, major, I mean, that's not so bad. It could be like a craftsman's
00:05:08 mark on each episode. Keep an eye on everybody for the Eleazar
00:05:12 discord t-shirt coming soon to the PCP. Yeah, we will we will
00:05:17 profit and not share any of it with him. And he will get it in
00:05:21 notifications. He will be, I mean, he'll get so much exposure
00:05:26 for people wearing his discord shirts. I saw a number on a
00:05:29 person's shirt and I'm crowded like in public and I just
00:05:33 thought I should say hi. I just thought I should contact Eleazar
00:05:38 for all my editing needs. That's what it made me think.
00:05:46 Yeah, so I don't know. This week, I think this week, Bitcoin
00:05:52 Bitcoin went well off down the tubes and it hasn't
00:05:57 been well. Welcome everybody to the procrastinators podcast.
00:06:01 We didn't even say that I'm to see you know now because I
00:06:03 said it before anybody else did. That's true. That's true. We
00:06:07 got Ben Saint and give and take on this episode. Anyways,
00:06:11 Bitcoin's shit now apparently it's down to 43k. Last I
00:06:15 checked it went it went down. Yeah, I bought this isn't I'll
00:06:19 just tell you I bought some when it was like high I bought some
00:06:22 at at 58k lol and then I bought some more after it fell. I
00:06:27 bought at like some more at like 40 48 I think I bought it
00:06:32 48 as well. Yeah. So they average out I think the amount
00:06:36 that I've got is averaged around like 52 and now it is down
00:06:40 to 44 and a half. So I mean it's not doing great but like you
00:06:46 know that's that's like a week. I'm like not that stressed
00:06:50 about it this time. I'm not well feeling as constantly
00:06:53 anxious as I as I was before. I feel I mean when it started
00:06:58 going down from like the peak the most recent peak mine says
00:07:02 like 41k as in pounds sterling. Yeah. So I don't know what it
00:07:07 is for you but like it started going down then it went back
00:07:10 up and I was just gonna come right back up and go even higher
00:07:13 and it has not done that. Yeah. So I'm losing money but like
00:07:18 I'm not cashing out ever so I guess I'm not losing anything.
00:07:22 I'm sad that Ethereum is down so much but I'm not super sad
00:07:26 because I haven't bought any Ethereum. I just got my
00:07:28 Ethereum for free. So who cares then. Dude 69 Ethereum. I want
00:07:33 that to be more. I want to get even bigger returns. It was
00:07:36 up to over 300. Now it's back down to 228 which is just
00:07:38 not. Okay. The worst thing that one voicemail said like
00:07:45 index funds is a good thing. Was that the thing he was
00:07:48 saying? Minerva. I forget who but was it an index fund?
00:07:52 Yeah. That was that was Minerva and I think she said it was
00:07:55 an index fund or something. Yeah. I was I've been meaning to
00:07:58 go back and listen to that segment again because she
00:08:00 seemed to have some good advice not for like from a vault
00:08:04 not for like fucking buy in the dip in a volatile market
00:08:07 like cryptos but just in like solid like long term
00:08:09 investing strategy. Yeah. Just kind of better like fuck this
00:08:14 up and down. I remember the name and I looked it up but
00:08:18 I wasn't sure if that was the thing they said but index
00:08:20 funds are like kind of like a stock that replicates like
00:08:26 sort of mimics the market as a whole. So if it's not one
00:08:31 particular thing. So if things are it's really safe bet
00:08:34 because it's very unlikely that everything goes down
00:08:38 such as in a 2008. Well, I think it kind of did like I
00:08:42 think I think like this week this the market just kind of
00:08:45 took a hit and sort of took Bitcoin down with it. That's
00:08:48 what I was reading. I don't actually know if that's true.
00:08:50 I could be totally wrong. That's what people on our
00:08:53 slash Bitcoin were saying. I will have to mention that this
00:08:58 is not a money show. We never understand money ever and we
00:09:02 will never understand Bitcoin. I understand I understand
00:09:05 money and I don't even don't even pretend that we're
00:09:09 trying to be smart about it. I'm not the worst thing that
00:09:13 happened this week though. This made me so angry. It was so
00:09:17 infuriating. I finally sold my GameStop only for it to
00:09:21 suddenly shoot up again. I had finally it was no like days
00:09:25 before like you know I bought it like at the beginning of a
00:09:28 month and I was like okay it like rose for like a couple days
00:09:31 there and then it settled back down and it had like not moved
00:09:33 and I was like okay it was just a meme. It's not going
00:09:36 anywhere and then like later that same week it suddenly
00:09:39 shoots up to like 180. Literally it went up to 200.
00:09:43 Yeah I would have I actually would have made money. If I had
00:09:45 sold to 200 I actually would have made money but no I lost
00:09:49 like most of it because I sold it 50. I sold it 160. I bought
00:09:54 it at 210 so I still lost a lot of money but like way better
00:09:57 than like I was considering just like getting rid of it.
00:10:00 So I'm like uh no but I was like no I'm going to hold.
00:10:03 I did just because you got to hold and in the game of Stonks
00:10:06 you either hold or die. No I don't believe you have to sell
00:10:10 eventually. You have to sell eventually. The key is timing
00:10:13 when and yet and I fucked it up. I just there were no
00:10:16 indications that anything else is going to happen with it.
00:10:20 I know because like because like they they had the the trial
00:10:22 or whatever or the the hearing with that guy with deep fucking
00:10:25 value and like I saw a little graph like when he said that he
00:10:28 was still bearish on GameStop apparently it had like you know
00:10:31 I was still even saying oh the the the stock shot up the
00:10:34 stock shut up and it looked and it went up by like eight
00:10:35 dollars. I was like okay so it's not really moving that much
00:10:39 and I was like fucking I'm selling and that only for to
00:10:41 like quidruple overnight. Yeah I was watching it happen in
00:10:46 real time like what is happening because like I'm in like I'm
00:10:49 in a discord server with like Saber Spark and a couple other
00:10:51 guys just talking about the stock stuff we're all just like
00:10:53 what is going on right now just watching it go up in real time
00:10:58 was crazy. Just. We decided that the stock market's not real
00:11:02 and it's fake and it'll never be understood ever by anyone.
00:11:06 I mean it's it's like it's it is gambling the whole thing the
00:11:10 Bitcoin the stocks the whatever you put in money. Saber was
00:11:15 mentioning something like options like do you know anything
00:11:18 about options? I think it was who's called option that I was
00:11:21 only half paying attention because like I used to know
00:11:24 you make like a bet that a stock is going to be at a certain
00:11:26 price by a certain time or you lose your money. I'm like how
00:11:30 is that not like why not just why not just invest in the
00:11:33 stock? I don't I don't know I don't get it but like just
00:11:36 explaining the concept I'm like isn't this just like like
00:11:39 betting on horses or something but you're just betting on
00:11:41 stock like literally I guess I guess people would bet that
00:11:44 the stock would go down and so they wouldn't want to have the
00:11:47 stock. I don't know. I don't understand. Well, she's short
00:11:50 it then. Like over that over that. Somebody in the in the
00:11:53 chat who's smart explained to me what why how that's not
00:11:57 gambling. I know in way too smooth brain to understand. I
00:12:00 know in theory how shorting a stock works. I have no clue
00:12:04 how one would actually go about doing it. So I don't know
00:12:07 maybe that's like an easier way of you just need a big bunch of
00:12:11 money. You you buy a bunch of stock. Okay. You buy a bunch of
00:12:15 stock. You borrow the stock and then you borrow it. The the the
00:12:18 key is no so that then you have to I hate you. I hate you.
00:12:23 You're explaining what it is in theory but how do you actually
00:12:25 do it? How do you actually do that? Just go to Google search
00:12:28 how to short stock and I'm sure wiki how will tell you exactly
00:12:31 how to do it with pictures. No, you don't know. I have no idea.
00:12:34 Yeah. Of course not. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't imagine that's what
00:12:39 I'm saying. I'm on a podcast on the internet. You think I know
00:12:41 anything of substance? If I did, I'd be doing that instead of
00:12:45 being on the procrastinators podcast. Okay. Well, you're
00:12:50 right. Obviously. The thing with all of this though is it's
00:12:56 like I put the money in and yes, technically it's you have to
00:13:01 cash out but I don't see any reason to cash out until you
00:13:06 can make a profit. Like if it never because if you die, I mean
00:13:10 it's so you can make a profit. Yeah, but like I don't know.
00:13:14 Whoa. It's like imagine if you spend like like like I don't
00:13:18 know a hundred pounds, a hundred dollars on food and then
00:13:21 that money is spent, the food is eaten, life goes on. In this
00:13:26 situation, you throw it down a well and in the future, it may
00:13:30 come back. I don't see much of a reason to like it's
00:13:35 reductive. I don't know. The reason is because there are
00:13:40 people who put money into stock market, they can't afford to
00:13:43 lose. That's why. It's all about opportunity cost, right?
00:13:47 Because like, okay, say you have, I don't know, Bitcoin and
00:13:52 Bitcoin is going, I mean, if Bitcoin goes down and Ethereum
00:13:56 goes up, then hypothetically, you would have made more money
00:13:59 if you had sold your Bitcoin and bought Ethereum. So like even
00:14:05 if you weren't like even if you were selling the Bitcoin of
00:14:08 the loss, you could be reducing your loss and maybe turning
00:14:10 loss into gain if you sold at the right time and did the
00:14:13 right thing with the money. It's about maximizing.
00:14:16 I know that the min-maxing of it is much more efficient at
00:14:21 like actually making the gains, but I don't like the lifestyle
00:14:26 and the, you know, I've said this before. Like to play it the
00:14:30 way I'm playing it, it's only useful to take out money when
00:14:34 there's a profit. Until then, it's gone and that's fine, but
00:14:39 it's like a ghost. You could revive it.
00:14:42 But if you, but only if you expect there to eventually be a
00:14:45 profit, right? Yeah, that might be, and that might not be, but
00:14:50 like, yeah, I invested in the first place on the assumption
00:14:53 that it would make a profit. My assumption, okay, I have, I
00:14:59 am not worried about the dip because I invested this, this
00:15:02 time I bought some Bitcoin with a solid, wait, who just left
00:15:06 the fucking call? Was that Craig? I fucking hate Craig.
00:15:10 Did Craig just abandon us? I, like he always does, yes.
00:15:14 He always, he always does this. Craig's the worst guest on the
00:15:17 PCP. He just doesn't work. Why doesn't he just fucking work?
00:15:21 Oh boy, I'm mad. He comes on here and he doesn't say
00:15:25 anything. Freeloader. And then when we, and when we have to
00:15:29 pay him, and we have to pay him 25% of the, of the, of the
00:15:33 cut, because he's so big. Man, it's a good thing we don't
00:15:41 rely on Craig and still record locally. Imagine if we just
00:15:44 lost everything. Lol. Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure. And then we
00:15:49 won't even, okay, whatever, we got the beginning. Okay, I'll
00:15:53 try and get him to come back in. It doesn't matter. Um, was,
00:15:57 wait, he's messaging. Oh, he said, okay, I fucking, I say,
00:16:03 hey, Craig rejoined the call and he DMs me to say, I'm already
00:16:06 recording that channel. No, you're fucking not Craig.
00:16:09 You're a liar, Craig. Fail to join. This is gaslighting.
00:16:12 I hate you. I hate you, Craig. I hate him so much. I hate his
00:16:15 stupid fucking bare face. It is like the worst illustration
00:16:21 ever. That's not true. But it's up there. It's up there.
00:16:24 It's very, it's poor. It's a poor. Um, okay, anyway, whatever,
00:16:28 I'll try and get him back in. If, uh, what was I saying? Fuck.
00:16:34 Something, something, something money, something, something
00:16:36 stonk, something, something Bitcoin, I don't remember.
00:16:38 No, no, no, I had a point I was gonna make. Uh, we were talking
00:16:43 about, what did you just say, Gib? I just said that there's
00:16:47 no reason to, like, like, you should always only sell it at
00:16:54 a profit and never sell it before that point. I remember.
00:16:57 I remember. Okay. I bought Bitcoin this time because I had
00:17:01 a notion and I still think it makes sense and is probably
00:17:05 true to some extent. And that is that everyone said that the
00:17:09 stimulus package, the money printers go, is going to, if
00:17:14 not cause inflation, it will at least create concern about
00:17:18 inflation and Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against inflation.
00:17:21 And therefore it makes some amount of sense to think that the
00:17:25 price of Bitcoin will rise in response to the stimuli and
00:17:29 also that people will be putting their stimmies into Bitcoin
00:17:32 because a lot of people want to invest and that'll be their
00:17:34 first opportunity to do so. So I think it makes logical sense
00:17:39 and I could be wrong. Well, it kind of did. I guess I think it,
00:17:44 I think it kind of did happen with previous stimmies, but so
00:17:46 I'm expecting that it, that, that there will be a jump in
00:17:50 response to the stimuli and I, I, I'm just going to hold it
00:17:55 until then. And if it crashes to zero and I lose everything,
00:17:59 well, fuck it. I won't starve. So, you know, it's fine. It's
00:18:04 fine. But it is, I do think it'll, I do think it'll crash
00:18:08 eventually. It won't stay at like 40 or 50 forever.
00:18:12 I think it might, like, my imagination really is just
00:18:15 saying, oh, patterns, huh? It went up real big from nothing.
00:18:20 And then it went back down and stayed down, but then it went
00:18:22 back up again and it went even higher. This means it will
00:18:27 absolutely go even higher than this time. And that's like my
00:18:30 stupid like a monkey pattern seeking brain is like, yes,
00:18:33 there's absolutely a chance that it will get even bigger than
00:18:37 this.
00:18:39 Yeah. You know, I did, I was, because I watch a YouTube
00:18:45 channel called Clear Value Tax where Brian explains how to
00:18:49 make money to me. Thanks, Brian. Love you. And he, this is
00:18:54 Donate to my Patreon and I'll tell you all about it. In
00:18:57 hindsight, in hindsight, I'm so infuriated because there was a
00:19:02 video that he, that he put out advising like how you should
00:19:06 like invest like specifically it was called When You Should
00:19:09 Sell Bitcoin. And basically his thesis was this thing about,
00:19:12 in response to the stimulus is probably gonna, he says like it
00:19:15 lines up timing wise with the time frame of like previous
00:19:18 Bitcoin crashes. And also the stimulus seems like it's a
00:19:22 promising thing that'll cause a rise. And so he's planning to
00:19:25 like start trickling his out around then. But he released that
00:19:30 on February 8th, literally the day that Tesla spent the like
00:19:35 billions of dollars on Bitcoin and it exploded. Like he
00:19:38 released it that same day. But I didn't watch it then. I
00:19:41 didn't watch it until several weeks later. And when I
00:19:44 watched it, I was like, he's right. And I invested and that
00:19:47 was the day it fucking crashed. It was so bad. Always. I hate
00:19:52 you, Brian. I hate you. You betrayed me.
00:19:56 Uh, brutal. Absolutely. I feel like the the Bitcoin era of
00:20:02 the PCP, um, it was pretty stupid. Oh, yeah. We never talk
00:20:07 about it ever again. Ben, you're just too lefty for stocks
00:20:11 that they just they just inherently it's like oil and
00:20:14 water. They hate me. Every time you get into the market, it
00:20:16 just pushes away from you. I I hope that's true. I wish I
00:20:21 had the power. If I if I had known that, okay, if you had
00:20:26 told me Ben, you actually have the power. If you invest in
00:20:30 Bitcoin, it will go down. You will lose your own money, but
00:20:33 it will destroy Bitcoin. I would have done it anyway just to
00:20:37 fuck Elon Musk over. I would have considered I would have
00:20:40 considered it to be a worthwhile investment. So in that
00:20:43 sense, I'm not too bothered about it. That might have lost
00:20:47 tons of money on Bitcoin, but he has the moral victory and
00:20:49 that's all that really matters. If if I had known that it
00:20:52 would have happened, I think I would have done it. Of
00:20:55 course, in reality, the drop would have happened without
00:20:59 me investing. So I wish I hadn't. And then I could have
00:21:02 just laughed at the dip without cringing in pain. But
00:21:08 it's not a perfect world. It's not a perfect world. I'm not
00:21:13 a perfect person. Oh, God. In a perfect world, men like me
00:21:20 would not exist. In a perfect world. You wouldn't exist.
00:21:24 What is that from? It's from the potion seller guy.
00:21:32 From what? He made a video where he was like, oh wait, the
00:21:37 thing you said? I don't know what that thing you said. No, what
00:21:39 you said. I was talking about the thing I said. Is it a
00:21:41 YouTuber? It's it's the guy who goes, you know, with the
00:21:45 funny face filter thing and he's like, potion seller, I
00:21:47 need one of your strongest potions. It's like my potions
00:21:50 are too strong for you, Trevor. You know that guy? I think
00:21:55 I know that guy. I think I'm only familiar with it second
00:21:57 hand. Oh, well, he's funny. And he makes those videos all
00:22:03 the time. Like just like fucking around with face filters.
00:22:07 And he did one where he was like, let me just find the
00:22:09 link. You can put it in the description. I learned a lot
00:22:12 today. Yeah. Post the link. Is Craig, Craig says he's in
00:22:18 here. What is he? Craig, we came and left like four times
00:22:22 during your tirade on easy Bitcoin. It was very strange. Oh
00:22:27 yeah, I've seen this video. Here's here's the video. It's
00:22:30 53 seconds long. That's too long. That's one whole voicemail
00:22:36 we could be listening to instead. It's not a perfect
00:22:41 world. Okay, okay. It's like pretty old, right? I remember
00:22:50 watching this seven years old. Yeah, okay. That's about
00:22:53 right. Oh, 2013. This filter is really good. It's really
00:22:59 working for me. That fucking Mac webcam filters going on
00:23:06 right now. I told Craig to join again. If he tells me he's
00:23:13 already recording, I'll know. I'll know that he that I
00:23:16 succeeded. He says he's in the call. He says a lot of
00:23:21 things. Not a very trustworthy narrator. No, terrible.
00:23:28 Yeah, go on. Funny videos. I think I was gonna say I think
00:23:34 okay, fine, okay. No, it's it's because of the lag. Like
00:23:38 every time I open my mouth, you have begun something and I
00:23:41 was like, oh, I should stop speaking and then every time
00:23:44 you hear me going, you're like, oh, Gabe wants to say
00:23:47 something. I should stop speaking. Look at this. I tell
00:23:52 it's it's in the call. I tell it to leave the call. It says
00:23:55 I'm not recording. It's not in the call. I say join the call.
00:23:58 He says I'm already recording. Curse him. Okay. We need to
00:24:02 stop talking about Craig. I'm sure the audience is not
00:24:04 super invested in our frustrations with a 12th member
00:24:09 of the procrastinators podcast, Craig. Or are they?
00:24:15 The commenters, let us know. Yeah, I guess so. I don't think
00:24:17 I've seen a single comment talking about Craig. The Craig
00:24:20 is in full swing. Bummer. It's like a sleeper arc. Yeah, I
00:24:27 think I am done. Not done, but I think I'm over my my deepest
00:24:33 obsession with Noida at this point. I think I've I think I
00:24:37 was going I think I was way too hooked on Noida for a
00:24:40 little bit there. But I had a I had a run I got them I got
00:24:45 one of the endings. I got the not the like get every orb
00:24:50 ending, but the get every orb just from like the normal
00:24:53 world ending, which is like almost the best ending. It's
00:24:57 like the second best one. So I feel like I've done a lot
00:25:03 with it. And maybe I can be a little free of its malign
00:25:09 influence now. I was I was trapped in its world, like
00:25:14 Jumanji. But now I was in there, mixing potions and
00:25:21 shit. Building wands. I was today I was today I was rambling
00:25:29 in my discord server about a wand crafting theory. No one
00:25:34 was interested. But I just wanted to explain about how an
00:25:38 autocast laser wand is actually really good because that
00:25:42 applies. It's a cast delay modifier without its mana
00:25:45 consumption. So just just think about that. Think about
00:25:51 that if you will fast. I'll think about it. Okay. Okay,
00:25:55 good. Okay, good. Well, that's me. That was that was my
00:26:00 week sick based. Love it. Me too. I have this music club
00:26:08 thing, where in a discord, we say to each other, let's
00:26:14 listen to these albums, we like bring an album forth, and
00:26:17 we vote on which ones we want to listen to, and then we
00:26:19 listen to them, and we talk about them. And the last
00:26:21 week, a pro mayor. Like the anime? Like the yeah, like
00:26:30 death note, like, like, like, like Naruto. He was a Naruto.
00:26:36 She was a Kunuichi. Could it be anymore obvious? I love that
00:26:40 song. He was a Naruto. She was a Kunuichi. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
00:26:46 yeah, yeah, yeah, stuff like that. I was like, I really
00:26:50 like that. I've heard that. I have no I have no idea what
00:26:54 you're talking about. Promare is like emo girl, singing
00:26:59 about feelings in the early 2000s band. Wait, isn't
00:27:04 pro-marine? Isn't pro-marine? Paramore. Paramore.
00:27:07 Okay. Paramore is a band. I know, sorry. It is an anime.
00:27:12 Okay. All right. I know. So, Paramore. So, Paramore AMV2
00:27:16 Paramore. Make it happen, people. Yeah, and if I can, it's
00:27:21 like Gun Girl Accord. It's like, that's good. That's what I
00:27:24 want. I want to be into that. I think the greatest human
00:27:27 achievement I can ever like achieve is to be unironically
00:27:31 into like Paramore and Evanescence and just be a big
00:27:35 actual fan of those sorts of things. That's a really lofty
00:27:38 goal you've set for yourself. I know. I'm trying. I don't
00:27:42 know. I'm struggling every day. I support this. I mean, it's
00:27:44 about the journey. It's about the climb. If you never make
00:27:48 it, it's okay. Yeah, so I listen to that. That was good. Do
00:27:54 you, like I, I, I, I, I missed out on, oh yeah. I, I, I don't
00:28:00 know much about that sort of music other than I've heard
00:28:03 bits of it in YouTube videos and I knew that emos were a
00:28:06 thing, but I never really saw any at school and I sort of
00:28:10 missed the boat on all of that stuff. I mean, but I kind of
00:28:14 feel like I like it. I kind of feel like I wanted to be that.
00:28:16 I, I not ironically enjoyed Evanescence first album and
00:28:20 even listening to it recently, as in recently being a few
00:28:24 years ago, still slaps, still like it. Did they not have,
00:28:28 were there no like emo or goth kids at school, Gib?
00:28:33 No, there must have been a few. There was one guy. But they
00:28:36 were all black so you couldn't see them. They were invisible.
00:28:39 Well, not, not like they wore all black. Yeah, that's what I
00:28:42 mean. Oh, the, the African American students. Oh, the
00:28:46 African American goth. They're completely invisible. That's
00:28:49 why, that's why they're so rare. It's a rare sighting. The
00:28:51 African British population just loves Paramores. I don't
00:28:56 know why even if they're wearing black, they would be
00:28:58 invisible because the, the world is like, it's the sun's out.
00:29:02 It's daytime. Um, you can see them. Only really. Maybe that's
00:29:07 why I never saw them. There was a girl in my photography
00:29:11 class who had like, seen girl hair without the, uh, like
00:29:15 hair dye. Yeah. And I was like, oh, she's, uh, pretty.
00:29:19 Yes. But she was a lesbian apparently. Of course. They
00:29:22 all are. Fuck up. She was, she was really cool. You can't.
00:29:26 That's the problem. No. No. But that, that was the only
00:29:29 person who was even remotely in that sort of thing.
00:29:32 Cool woman. Pick one. That's what I'm saying.
00:29:37 How about both? That's my official statement. No.
00:29:41 No. What if Dora the Explorer was a goth? Yeah. What if she was?
00:29:48 What then? Dora the Explorer, goth blingy gift circa 2001 on
00:29:52 MySpace. It exists somewhere, I'm sure.
00:29:57 Yes, I'm Dora the Explorer. Yes, I'm goth. We exist.
00:30:02 We should be, uh, goth. We should like do a goth rad con.
00:30:07 I already was. I already was goth. I mean, we're, we're, we're
00:30:10 like tombstones right now. Right now we're dead. Like tombstones.
00:30:14 We should be skeletons as well. There should be bats and spiders.
00:30:17 Think about the Halloween episode we're going to have with
00:30:19 these images. It's going to be so aesthetic. Oh my God. Yes.
00:30:23 The Halloween episode, we're going to be like fucking
00:30:27 Five Nights at Freddy if I'd.
00:30:29 Ooh. Do you see that new Five Nights at Freddy's game for PS5?
00:30:32 It's like full 3D now. Like it's pretty weird. It's pretty crazy.
00:30:36 Uh, no. Yeah, I saw that. There was a Sony, like Nintendo Switch
00:30:42 Direct, but Sony version. They should make the Five Nights at Freddy's in VR.
00:30:48 I mean, I'm sure they have Five Nights at Freddy's. They already do.
00:30:51 Oh, well, you know, it was really strange about that new Five Nights at Freddy's game
00:30:55 that like fucked with me. Is that like they had like actual,
00:30:58 like human characters in like third person you could see the people
00:31:02 and they looked like cartoons. I'm imagining they look like the doll people in Toy Story,
00:31:07 like Andy. Yeah, it kind of was like that. And I'd always just kind of assumed it was just like
00:31:11 photo realistic humans and only the animatronics. That's, that's why they're animatronics.
00:31:16 That's why Five Nights at Freddy's like works and is good because you don't see any humans.
00:31:20 And the only characters you see are the animatronics, which are made according to
00:31:25 what's his name's like, what's his name is just he's only, he's only good at making like terrible
00:31:29 looking animatronics, which just happens to work with a game that's about being hunted by evil
00:31:34 animatronics. Yeah, if, yeah, there's a reason it's minimal. That's terrible. I didn't,
00:31:41 I didn't think, I didn't think that was a good call. I think it should have,
00:31:44 should have been real looking humans, but you know, it's like, yeah, so they don't care about
00:31:49 what I think, I guess. Yeah, it should have had like FMV actors or something. That would have been
00:31:54 sick. Yeah, that's what I, that's what I would have done. 480p, 124p, video file, human actors on
00:32:02 a green screen. Yeah, like a Sega CD. Yeah, like 12 FPS. Sega CD shit should come back. It was
00:32:10 terrible, but I like looking at it. Yeah, yeah, it's good stuff. But good, I mean bad. Yeah,
00:32:16 because the only human you see in a Five Nights at Freddy's game is you. Well, I mean, and you
00:32:20 don't see yourself. So it's just assumed that you just look like yourself. And you're just in this
00:32:25 place with these robots. And the robots look like they look because they're designed to be like
00:32:30 cartoony looking. And yeah. And then they got blood, they got red blood coming out. And it's like,
00:32:38 it's like a creepypasta. And they got big teeth. I've probably talked about, I've probably talked
00:32:44 about it before, but when I get, I get inspired whenever I think about that, how like, I mean,
00:32:51 you know, like his Scott Cawthorne's game, like before Five Nights at Freddy's, like the kind
00:32:56 of stuff he made. It's like a cute animal platform where they got tore to shreds because it looked
00:33:00 creepy. So he was like, all right, let's just roll with it. And he made it creepy. Yeah, because
00:33:04 when he tried to make animal characters in 3D, his aesthetic was just like just bad and looked
00:33:09 gross and creepy. So we just leaned into it and made a game about creepy looking animal characters.
00:33:13 I like unironically love stories like that. Yeah. It's like, I'm bad at everything. I'm bad at
00:33:19 everything except this one thing. So let me make a game that's completely about that and it works
00:33:23 and it's genius. A story that vaguely reminded me of that because like, you know, like Daft Punk,
00:33:28 you know, you know how Daft Punk, like they're dead, they die, they're gone. I heard they're dead.
00:33:33 Yeah. Sad face, press F in the chat for Daft Punk. I was reading an article about like Daft Punk,
00:33:38 because, you know, in regards to them, like no longer being a thing. And I guess like before
00:33:43 Daft Punk, they had like another like band with like a third guy and they got a really bad review
00:33:50 and someone called it like Daft Punkish or something or other. And they took that and made
00:33:54 a new band called Daft Punk and it blew the fuck up. That guy must be like an idiot.
00:33:58 That's great. That guy, that guy is the is the TJ Henry Yoshi of music reviews.
00:34:04 You know, he said an A-press is an A-press. You can't tell it's only a half. Well,
00:34:10 shows what you know. An A-chord is an A-chord. You can't play only a half A-chord. You can.
00:34:17 I saw a gif or I saw a video showing the original song that the one more time
00:34:24 chorus was sampled from and like how it was. Yeah. Yeah. It was like stretched out and like
00:34:28 pieces cut out of it and, you know, cycled around. Super cool. I kind of, I mean, when has
00:34:35 Daft Punk like put out a new album in years? I mean, I know they weren't dead. Random Access
00:34:40 Memories was the last one. They felt pretty dead to me for a long time.
00:34:45 You know, they felt like something that used to make, somebody that used to make music.
00:34:51 Yeah. I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't, they weren't really on my radar until Random Access Memories.
00:34:56 I think I'd maybe heard of them before once or twice. I love to describe it.
00:34:59 And then that was like an incredible album that's like, oh, wow. I can't really see if they do
00:35:04 anything more. And then like that came out in 2012 or something. Have you seen, have you seen
00:35:10 Interstellar 5555? Hell yeah. Love that movie. Yeah. It's great. Do you know what it is?
00:35:18 Is it when they go back in time because there's this space and there's a time vortex and they
00:35:23 No, they don't go back in time. They go to like a different galaxy or a different universe.
00:35:29 They get like abducted for something, right? Yes. They get abducted from like an Earth guy.
00:35:37 Abducts these alien, these aliens of bands. Daft Punk made an album called Discovery and
00:35:44 Interstellar 5555. And like Discovery is like their big one that has like one more time and stuff.
00:35:49 Yeah, that's the album that this movie is based on because they took the entire album
00:35:54 and they animated like an anime movie to all the songs in succession.
00:35:59 And the plot is like, it's like these alien band and like they get abducted by some Earth
00:36:03 people and like reprogrammed to think they're like an Earth band, like they look like humans.
00:36:07 And it's a lie. Literally this guy, he's just a music executive and he's like, hmm,
00:36:13 I gotta chomp on his cigar. I gotta find some talent. I gotta moichandize something.
00:36:20 It's like Space Jam, except it's at a basketball. It's music.
00:36:23 It's like Space Jam in reverse. Pretty much.
00:36:26 Oh, she's like, oh shit, but the best band in the universe is on another planet.
00:36:31 Can't make money from that.
00:36:32 I know, I'll steal him and I'll paint him to look human and that's what he does.
00:36:38 It's really a euphemism for capitalism and how it's exploitative when you really think.
00:36:42 Doesn't he? Is that the blue people in the music video?
00:36:46 Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
00:36:48 It was on that tsunami back in the day.
00:36:50 He literally like puts them through a machine that like splats them with like human colors,
00:36:54 skin, goo and makes them look like humans.
00:36:59 Harder, better. I don't forget what it's actually called.
00:37:01 Yes. Oh God.
00:37:04 I think it's called Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.
00:37:06 Yeah, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.
00:37:08 It's legendary. It's great. Definitely worth watching. Check it out.
00:37:13 The best one. I like the one where the space, the alien like army guy who is sent to rescue them
00:37:21 is like looking at the poster of the girl and it might not be the right one.
00:37:28 It might not be the right time, but there's something about.
00:37:32 Yeah, that one's a, I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting all emotional.
00:37:39 That's pretty good.
00:37:40 What interested me about the Daft Punk like epilogue video was the,
00:37:45 you know, the two guys Daft and Punk.
00:37:49 Daft kept walking and Punk was just like, no, I've had enough. I want to stop.
00:37:55 And then the other, you know, Goldilocks, Golden Manhead, he,
00:38:00 he blew up his friend because he wanted to stop making music.
00:38:06 Obviously the metaphor is that I want to stop being in the band,
00:38:10 but the other guy just keeps walking.
00:38:12 So I wonder if like there's going to be more of his music.
00:38:16 I didn't know there was a video. I haven't seen this.
00:38:18 Oh yeah. Oh, it's, it's a really cool video.
00:38:21 It's super cool. It's like a little short film.
00:38:22 Oh, okay.
00:38:23 To like announcing there.
00:38:25 Yeah, they put it up on YouTube.
00:38:26 Yeah. It's, it's, it's a wordless announcement.
00:38:29 Like it's, it's very well put together.
00:38:32 It's just like body language tells the entire story.
00:38:35 And one of them blows up.
00:38:37 And an explosion, a very sick explosion.
00:38:39 Completely final, like, like the helmet is destroyed.
00:38:42 It's gone. He's gone.
00:38:43 Oh.
00:38:43 Say my final message.
00:38:44 It's actually like, maybe feel a little bit.
00:38:46 Maybe feel a little bit.
00:38:47 Watching the Silver Man get blown.
00:38:50 It wasn't good, but like it was well done.
00:38:52 I was like, oh man, goodbye.
00:38:55 He like takes, he like stops and like takes his jacket off.
00:38:58 And there's a self-destruct button on the back.
00:39:00 And like the gold guy presses it and he just walks.
00:39:02 And there's this long shot that lasts way too long.
00:39:05 And then he blows up.
00:39:06 It's fucking sick, but sad.
00:39:07 And made me feel like really like bad.
00:39:10 Gold guy has to go on to join a steam powered giraffe now.
00:39:15 He has to join up with the only other robot band in existence.
00:39:19 It's the only place for him.
00:39:22 He keeps walking in the desert and he bumps into,
00:39:24 can guess it on the lizard wizard.
00:39:26 Gold's going to make a cameo in the Five Nights at Freddy's
00:39:28 video game coming.
00:39:29 He's going to come into like the next Gorillaz album.
00:39:32 Got to make money somehow in the interim.
00:39:34 He takes his like dome screen face off
00:39:36 and it's just teeth under there.
00:39:38 And he used the Five Nights at Freddy's all alone.
00:39:43 That was Freddy.
00:39:44 Oh, he was Freddy.
00:39:45 Of course.
00:39:46 Of course.
00:39:47 Freddy Fazbear under there the whole time.
00:39:50 Doftpunk at Freddy's.
00:39:52 Mm.
00:39:53 I'm glad we figured that out.
00:39:58 How unfortunate that our specific expertise,
00:40:01 we can figure out that deep mystery,
00:40:03 but we can't figure out the stock market or Bitcoin.
00:40:05 It's because there's not enough funny things
00:40:07 in the stock market.
00:40:08 It's just numbers.
00:40:11 Where's the pixels?
00:40:12 Where's the fucking high res bloom effect?
00:40:15 I don't like looking at it.
00:40:17 Where's the contrasting colors?
00:40:19 Oh, never mind.
00:40:20 It's here on my price chart.
00:40:22 There's the red candles and the green candles.
00:40:24 It's a masterpiece.
00:40:27 Yeah, never mind.
00:40:28 Never mind.
00:40:30 Bitcoin is actually the greatest work of art
00:40:32 of the 21st century.
00:40:36 It's true.
00:40:37 I think those like fake like CG renderings of a Bitcoin,
00:40:42 if it were physical, does a lot to sell people on the idea.
00:40:47 Like way more than people would imagine.
00:40:49 You mean the one that the slime coin is based on?
00:40:51 Yeah, those like fake like, what if Bitcoin was real?
00:40:55 I mean, there are real coins like that.
00:40:58 They're like, they're just collectible.
00:40:59 But like, the idea to make that at all
00:41:03 is like a really good publicity thing.
00:41:05 Because I don't know what the fuck a graph coin looks like.
00:41:09 I mean, I watched it.
00:41:11 I think I mentioned that someone sent me a video explaining
00:41:14 what it actually is and it's not what I thought it is at all.
00:41:19 It's literally a Bitcoin is literally like a record of transactions.
00:41:23 Basically, that's encrypted.
00:41:26 It's like the very basic version that leaves out a lot.
00:41:30 There was a guy linked me a really good video about it.
00:41:33 And I think I mentioned it on a previous episode,
00:41:35 but now I forget what it was called.
00:41:39 Yeah, it's hard to visualize and it doesn't matter really.
00:41:43 Because like at the end of the day,
00:41:44 it's just the same as any other stock.
00:41:46 Like I pay money in and the number goes up or down
00:41:48 and then I get money out and it's more or less and yay.
00:41:52 That's all it really means to me.
00:41:55 Yeah, I guess it's better than trading with loaves of bread
00:42:00 because those go moldy.
00:42:03 I can't store those in a bank.
00:42:05 Those aren't a secure store of value.
00:42:11 You got to read debt.
00:42:13 Gib, did you ever read debt by David Graber?
00:42:16 No, I heard about it.
00:42:18 I was in the book reading club with Munchie and I was like,
00:42:20 ah, you know, this sounds like something I should do
00:42:23 and I didn't do it.
00:42:24 Debt is one of the most interesting books I've ever read.
00:42:28 I recommend it to everyone.
00:42:30 It's fascinating.
00:42:32 I feel like it'd be a huge downer if I read it though.
00:42:34 It's not that much of a downer.
00:42:36 It's not even that like.
00:42:38 But I'm in so much debt, Ben.
00:42:41 Would that make it a downer?
00:42:42 Oh, um, I mean, yeah.
00:42:46 You're a downer no matter what.
00:42:47 You know, that's fair.
00:42:48 That might be a little upsetting.
00:42:49 That might be it might be a little irritating.
00:42:51 But I mean, what it what it really does is it like money
00:42:56 doesn't come from where you think it comes from basically.
00:43:01 And like the the idea that like the idea that like.
00:43:06 It's a talk about fractional reserve banking
00:43:08 and how the U.S. government buys bonds
00:43:10 from the Federal Reserve in exchange for reserve notes.
00:43:13 And then a little banks can like loan it out.
00:43:15 But every time they make a loan,
00:43:16 they actually can like loan out 10 times the amount of money they have.
00:43:20 Well, I mean, it's it's more about like the historical like development of it
00:43:24 and how like pre industrial cultures have things that are like money,
00:43:28 but are really not used in the same ways that we use money.
00:43:32 And and how like people just kind of assume that like before money,
00:43:39 there was a sort of there like the barter system was used.
00:43:41 And there was like an exchange, you know, a certain like number of loaves of bread
00:43:46 equal like a number of, you know, like clay bricks or whatever.
00:43:50 But like, it's not really that simple.
00:43:52 And like the idea of like payment and exchange and owing sort of like came after money,
00:43:59 like the money was invented and it wasn't like there was no.
00:44:03 I don't know.
00:44:03 It's more complicated than I'm I mean, that that would be interesting.
00:44:08 Like the fucking missing link between bartering and money.
00:44:10 Like yeah, like it's not as it's not.
00:44:14 There was there wasn't it's not like, oh, we used to barter,
00:44:17 but then money was invented.
00:44:18 And that just simplified bartering like no money kind of came first.
00:44:24 It's in a in a way.
00:44:26 It's pretty long book.
00:44:27 There's a lot I should reread it actually,
00:44:28 because I'm sure there was stuff I missed on the on the first go.
00:44:34 Not as long as, um, oh God, what was that other one?
00:44:39 Oh, fuck, there was one like 17 hour one was like an old historical book
00:44:46 by a guy like a nobleman who visited the United States in like its slavery times
00:44:51 and wrote about it.
00:44:53 Oh, that one was boring.
00:44:55 That one was boring, but I stuck it out.
00:44:57 I listened to the whole thing and now I can't remember what it was called.
00:45:01 No, sorry, I fucked up.
00:45:03 How unfortunate.
00:45:04 Very sad, sad.
00:45:08 Wow.
00:45:09 What are there?
00:45:10 What else happened this week, guys?
00:45:14 Any any news?
00:45:16 Do we want to talk about?
00:45:17 No, OK, go on.
00:45:18 Go on.
00:45:19 I was just going to talk about how I'm really sad that computer parts are forever
00:45:27 gone.
00:45:28 Like it's never going to happen.
00:45:29 I wanted to buy a new graphics card.
00:45:30 I wanted to play some new video games and super high frame rates.
00:45:34 And you just can't you just can't do it.
00:45:36 And it really sucks.
00:45:39 And it's really bothering me because I keep thinking like, oh, I can't.
00:45:42 How much longer can it last?
00:45:44 How much longer can this chip shortage last?
00:45:46 How much longer can these scalpers continue to win?
00:45:49 And now everyone's saying like it's probably going to go through 2022.
00:45:52 I'm like, oh, I didn't know.
00:45:56 I didn't even know that was happening.
00:45:58 It's so bad.
00:45:59 So like there's there's been like a huge shortage of just like like chip manufacturing
00:46:05 because like basically everybody gets their chips manufactured through a company called
00:46:08 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing or TSMC.
00:46:12 So they're getting slammed with all these like orders like you got to make the fucking
00:46:15 all the new consoles.
00:46:16 You got to make all the fucking Apple iPhone things.
00:46:18 You got to make all the AMD process.
00:46:20 You're going to make all the Nvidia graphics cards.
00:46:22 And like, well, actually, Nvidia makes goes to the Samsung.
00:46:24 But that's besides the point.
00:46:26 So like there's just a huge shortage of just like chips, like computer components.
00:46:31 And so we're at the point now where the shortage is getting so bad
00:46:34 that even like car manufacturers can't finish making cars because like the computers that
00:46:39 run cars like you can't make them anymore.
00:46:42 And so like new graphics cards and stuff launched like six months ago and they're
00:46:47 still impossible to get a hold of.
00:46:48 And it's at the point where like at first, like there's like this whole like
00:46:54 gray market of people who would like buy shoes with like like computer like algorithms,
00:47:00 like immediately buy all the stock and then flip them and like scalp them for like way
00:47:04 higher prices.
00:47:05 And I guess someone, some of them figured out, Hey, why don't we like start scalping
00:47:08 video game consoles and computer components because they're way more expensive.
00:47:12 And so all these cards are being immediately bought by like algorithms
00:47:16 and sold for like triple to quadruple what they're supposed to cost.
00:47:18 And it's been that way since like September when all the shit launched.
00:47:22 And now like they just released new cards, like a $300 graphics card and video did.
00:47:28 And now the stores are just like, fuck it, we're going to scalp it.
00:47:31 So the stores are listing them at $600.
00:47:33 I just cut out the middle man.
00:47:35 Like this, the retailer.
00:47:36 So now selling them for double the cost of what they're supposed to be.
00:47:39 And it's just like the nightmare is never going to end.
00:47:41 And it's like, I just want a PS5 and they're still not in stock and they won't be until next year.
00:47:47 That sucks so bad.
00:47:48 No, you know what the worst thing is?
00:47:49 You know what the worst thing is?
00:47:50 I had a 30, 60 TI in my house.
00:47:54 I bought one.
00:47:55 I paid $200 more than I should have for it.
00:47:58 And it was broken.
00:47:59 I had to send it back.
00:48:01 The one card I could actually get was defective and I had to return it.
00:48:05 And New Eggs specifically was like, we don't have a return policy on this.
00:48:09 You have to get it replaced.
00:48:11 I'm like, good.
00:48:12 I want it replaced.
00:48:13 And they're like, we don't have any stock.
00:48:14 Where does she find you?
00:48:15 I'm like, fuck, it's gone.
00:48:17 And now I'm not going to be able to get one until next year.
00:48:21 It's truly a nightmare.
00:48:22 It sucks.
00:48:25 How can anybody be letting this happen?
00:48:30 Like so many people are involved in computers.
00:48:33 Well, how do you stop it?
00:48:34 Well, how do you stop it?
00:48:36 I mean, increase the supply, I guess.
00:48:38 But the scalping thing is like, you take all of the stuff away from the hands of the consumers.
00:48:47 Yeah, you would think that market forces would increase supply in exchange.
00:48:51 Like this obviously represents a surplus of demand.
00:48:54 Well, the problem, I guess, right now is because of COVID and shit.
00:48:57 And because there's only like all these all these fucking companies use one company to do all their
00:49:02 manufacturing TSMC does like all the manufacturing for AMD, all the manufacturing for Apple,
00:49:08 you know, like even even like, I think even Intel now, they usually do their manufacturing
00:49:14 in-house, but they're starting to move to TSMC as well.
00:49:16 So like they're just like slammed and there's just too much demand and there's not enough supply.
00:49:21 And it's just bad.
00:49:22 It's really fucking bad.
00:49:24 That one guy who like he had like 500 PS5s or whatever, he was going to scalp them for
00:49:30 higher price and then he got robbed.
00:49:33 I remember that.
00:49:34 It's pretty funny.
00:49:35 That was based.
00:49:35 It was pretty based.
00:49:37 There was like a thing for a while back in like I think December.
00:49:39 I don't know whether I like the idea that like this situation should be happening at all.
00:49:45 No, it should.
00:49:45 Scalping PS5s doesn't bother me as much as like people that were scalping like toilet paper
00:49:50 and hand sanitizer because those are like those are like necessities.
00:49:54 Yeah.
00:49:55 Yeah, but like still, I mean still fuck scalpers, but like, you know, not as much.
00:50:01 I'm more insulted that stores are just scalping now.
00:50:04 I'm just like, yeah, it sucks.
00:50:07 It's super gross.
00:50:08 I just like this is a serious problem because like if people need stuff and there's just some
00:50:16 like a very small minority of people who have all of the things from the stores,
00:50:22 then the stores are just what they're going to.
00:50:26 This can't be sustainable.
00:50:28 I mean, Nvidia is now selling like five year old graphics cards again,
00:50:32 just to have something to sell.
00:50:33 And those are selling for way more than they cost when they first came out
00:50:37 because the demand is just there and people are just buying whatever is there.
00:50:40 It's really dumb.
00:50:42 But I don't know.
00:50:43 I guess I guess cap free markets.
00:50:46 Like if they'll pay for it, let them buy it.
00:50:48 Question mark.
00:50:49 Like I bought my old ass graphics card like three years ago for like $180.
00:50:54 It's selling for like 400 plus used right now.
00:50:57 Hey, I got good news though.
00:50:59 Bitcoin, Bitcoin's up to 45.
00:51:02 Oh God, fuck you.
00:51:04 Holy shit.
00:51:06 That rose a whole five hundo.
00:51:10 1.28% according to Robinhood.
00:51:12 It's up.
00:51:12 Very nice.
00:51:14 Oh yeah, I can see it.
00:51:15 It's interesting how like all crypto moves at the same time.
00:51:19 Like I'm looking at Dogecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin and like the trends are all identical.
00:51:23 Like the market moves together for the most part.
00:51:25 It's very strange.
00:51:26 Seems to you.
00:51:26 Too large.
00:51:27 Dogecoin is still just kind of, how is it?
00:51:30 It's fucking around.
00:51:32 It's just kind of tipping off for a while.
00:51:36 Yeah, it's just kind of hanging out.
00:51:37 My investment in Dogecoin was pretty good.
00:51:39 I'm up 100% on Dogecoin still.
00:51:43 I invested a little too late.
00:51:45 I have, what do I have?
00:51:47 Like 600 Dogecoin or something?
00:51:49 I have 5,597 Dogecoin currently.
00:51:59 I mean, I would say I wouldn't expect it, but you know,
00:52:02 that's coming from the guy who sold his GameStop.
00:52:04 So what the fuck do I know?
00:52:06 Did you, someone was telling me,
00:52:08 I don't remember if I mentioned this last time on the podcast,
00:52:10 how Elon Musk wants saying like,
00:52:13 Oh, I want to send Dogecoin to the moon.
00:52:16 I want to invest in it big time,
00:52:18 but it's really kind of not cool that a small amount of people own almost all the Dogecoins.
00:52:23 So you got to sell off your Dogecoin first, then I'll invest.
00:52:26 And it's like, says the richest man in the world.
00:52:29 Like what are you talking about?
00:52:30 What a fucking dick.
00:52:31 I hate him.
00:52:32 I hate him so much.
00:52:33 I only heard that second hand, so it could be completely full of shit.
00:52:37 I will believe literally anything you tell me about Elon.
00:52:40 There's nothing that I would put past him.
00:52:43 He's a good guy.
00:52:44 You're right.
00:52:47 There's a fucking thing that Ben won't believe.
00:52:50 Yeah, I think I saw those tweets.
00:52:51 He was just, I didn't, maybe I didn't comprehend it correctly,
00:52:54 but the gist I was getting was like,
00:52:58 he was hyping up Dogecoin like,
00:53:00 Hey Dogecoin, and everyone was like,
00:53:02 Oh yeah, Dogecoin, then it went up.
00:53:03 Wait, so he's saying sell your Bitcoin so he can make it.
00:53:06 Sell your Dogecoin.
00:53:07 What?
00:53:08 Yeah, so we can make it go up.
00:53:09 Why?
00:53:10 I don't know what that was.
00:53:12 I think that narrative is that it's supposed to be like the people's crypto
00:53:14 because it's so inexpensive to get into as opposed to something like Bitcoin.
00:53:18 But if you heard that, why would you then sell it?
00:53:20 I don't know.
00:53:21 He's saying he's going to make it go up.
00:53:23 I don't.
00:53:24 So sell it?
00:53:24 Like no.
00:53:25 I interpret it as him like super transparently just trying to make money
00:53:31 of the people who he knows he can influence to make something go up.
00:53:35 That's what I figured.
00:53:36 It seemed like if selling it, because if you sell,
00:53:38 if all the people who hold Bitcoin sell, the price will go down,
00:53:42 then he can buy it all up and get rich.
00:53:47 Yeah, I swear to God with what I remember seeing.
00:53:50 But I don't know.
00:53:51 I'm making things up.
00:53:52 I don't know.
00:53:52 It could be totally wrong.
00:53:56 When I encounter an Elon guy on the internet,
00:53:59 and once in a while I find them and they are, they're just Vincent,
00:54:05 and it makes me so mad.
00:54:07 I'm so angry every time I talk to one.
00:54:10 Like they're not human.
00:54:11 They're subhuman.
00:54:12 They're monsters.
00:54:14 They're demons.
00:54:15 I think they're the worst.
00:54:16 If it's the next issue, the vapor is going to be all about
00:54:19 Vincent investing in crypto.
00:54:21 I kind of thought that like, you know,
00:54:23 maybe Vincent would be an Elon guy.
00:54:25 I don't know.
00:54:25 Maybe there's a story there at some point.
00:54:28 I don't know.
00:54:33 No.
00:54:33 No, thank you.
00:54:35 Love it.
00:54:40 What else?
00:54:40 What else?
00:54:43 Okay.
00:54:44 Okay.
00:54:44 I guess now's a good time as any.
00:54:46 I want to talk about yesterday in the Radcon.
00:54:53 Yesterday in the Radcon of Discord server.
00:54:59 Last week to everybody listening.
00:55:00 Because it's last week.
00:55:01 This would have been a week in some ago.
00:55:03 Yeah.
00:55:05 This was a Saturday.
00:55:08 So we had been talking to Trixie about the Brony lecture.
00:55:14 And without going into too much detail,
00:55:17 Trixie adamantly would not said no,
00:55:22 she will not release the Brony lecture as it is.
00:55:26 Not only that, she will not allow the raw footage to be seen
00:55:29 even by backers.
00:55:32 And we said backers should maybe see it
00:55:36 because it's like behind the scenes footage.
00:55:38 And that's kind of it's rad content.
00:55:40 And she said no, no, I won't do it.
00:55:44 And she made a number of statements in the Discord server,
00:55:48 which made me very upset.
00:55:51 And I in which I want to disavow specifically
00:55:56 as not representative of the PCP ethos.
00:56:00 And here are some of those.
00:56:02 Oh, you have them prepared.
00:56:04 I have them prepared.
00:56:05 Oh, God, all right.
00:56:07 One, I'm trying to do a Trixie voice.
00:56:12 And you won't tell me what to do
00:56:14 because I don't respect you on the basis of having given me money.
00:56:18 I think that's disgusting, reprehensible human behavior.
00:56:23 I believe, I respect you a lot if you give me money.
00:56:26 Let's see here.
00:56:30 A backer says, we were invested and we trusted you.
00:56:34 Trixie responds, yeah, well, guess what?
00:56:37 I can't afford to make good on your investment.
00:56:39 The fact you made a faulty investment
00:56:41 doesn't fund me to pay for it.
00:56:44 I would disavow that.
00:56:46 You giving me money to do something does fund me to do the thing.
00:56:50 I said, this is just kind of a big middle finger
00:56:53 to all our supporters.
00:56:55 Trixie said, if this is how they act, then yes,
00:56:58 I am giving them the finger.
00:56:59 I don't have to respect people just because they gave me money,
00:57:02 to which I would say I do respect you if you give me money.
00:57:05 There's a lot of that sentiment.
00:57:07 There was a lot of that sentiment going around
00:57:09 that like, fuck you if you give me money.
00:57:11 I just want to say, no, please, please give me money.
00:57:18 Fucking aside, please.
00:57:21 The general consensus here, I believe,
00:57:24 is that we don't really stand by anything
00:57:28 that was said in the heat of the moment yesterday.
00:57:31 No, it was a shit show.
00:57:33 It was a real shit show.
00:57:34 It was not good.
00:57:36 It was bad and then I went to go play D&D
00:57:38 and then I came back and I realized
00:57:39 for like the four hours I was there,
00:57:40 it was still going on and got worse.
00:57:42 I'm like, oh my god.
00:57:45 I kind of saw it going on and I did,
00:57:47 but I didn't say anything until someone like added me
00:57:51 about something in the conversation
00:57:53 and then I felt obliged to enter into it and I did
00:57:59 and I got very upset and I said some things
00:58:03 that I don't apologize for, Lamal.
00:58:06 I mean, I think it goes without saying
00:58:08 that everybody here wants to get everything
00:58:10 that was promised from Radcon delivered
00:58:12 in a timely fashion as best to our abilities.
00:58:15 Unfortunately, the Brony Lecture may be trapped
00:58:20 in a way that we can't access,
00:58:23 but everything within our power will be released
00:58:27 in A's timely fashion as possible.
00:58:31 Yeah, I mean, you made the Kickstarter update post today.
00:58:39 Yes, and I have breaking news
00:58:43 that the animated OP is done.
00:58:47 So the OVA can get finished.
00:58:50 Literally like an hour after I posted the update
00:58:52 when I said, because you had just said that's right.
00:58:54 It'd be like a month and change and like literally an hour later.
00:59:00 You said they said before, like maybe end of February
00:59:03 and yeah, it's the last day of February and here it is.
00:59:06 So good on them.
00:59:08 Yeah, but now we've got a-
00:59:09 It looks pretty cool.
00:59:10 It looks pretty cool.
00:59:12 It looks good.
00:59:13 I mean, it looks better than I think it's-
00:59:17 Better than it has any right to be.
00:59:19 Yeah, yeah, for real.
00:59:22 I'm excited for people to see that.
00:59:24 I'm not sure if there's anything we need to release before
00:59:28 that comes out like the Brad Lecture.
00:59:31 I think-
00:59:32 We'll have to double check the order,
00:59:34 but I think the OVA was like in terms of the editing things.
00:59:40 That was like the biggest roadblock
00:59:41 because that was something we couldn't do ourselves.
00:59:43 But like the OVA and the Brad Lecture
00:59:45 and even the music video for the diss track
00:59:48 are all, we can do all those directly.
00:59:50 So hopefully-
00:59:50 I think, wait a minute.
00:59:55 I think that the OVA isn't like canonically,
00:59:59 doesn't the OVA immediately follow the Brad Lecture, right?
01:00:04 I believe so.
01:00:06 Oh, wait, the Brad-
01:00:09 It's been a year.
01:00:10 No, no, it's the music video for the diss track
01:00:16 that follows the Brad Lecture.
01:00:18 Yeah, it's the Brad Lecture, then the diss track,
01:00:20 and then the OVA after.
01:00:22 The OVA is the story of what happens
01:00:25 when we go on summer break from the lectures, which is school.
01:00:28 That is true.
01:00:31 Wait, yeah, but the last lecture was the Brad Lecture.
01:00:35 Okay, then is that, I don't know.
01:00:38 Yeah, I haven't looked at the footage in a long time.
01:00:42 I mean, me either.
01:00:43 I haven't looked at it at all.
01:00:44 I just lived it.
01:00:46 No, you don't want to look.
01:00:48 It really does feel like a fever dream.
01:00:51 I mean, that was-
01:00:53 It can't possibly have happened.
01:00:56 It's strange to think that the last thing we did in a pre-COVID world
01:01:00 was fucking RatCon 4.
01:01:04 I'm convinced it caused COVID.
01:01:08 Yeah, I mean, we used COVID's name in vain quite a few times
01:01:12 and summoned its wrath.
01:01:14 We upset it.
01:01:18 We didn't think it was real.
01:01:19 We thought it was just a joke.
01:01:21 I don't want to say anymore to spoil it.
01:01:23 But I think it has only gotten funnier in hindsight,
01:01:28 in my opinion.
01:01:30 Unfortunately, we are the reason people are dying
01:01:33 in more ways than one.
01:01:34 No, well, maybe.
01:01:37 No.
01:01:40 No, no.
01:01:41 Rat COVID-19.
01:01:43 Yeah.
01:01:45 Rat.
01:01:48 What you said, you hit the nail on the head.
01:01:55 What a joy.
01:01:55 You know, I'm so excited.
01:01:56 I'm so excited for it to come out.
01:01:59 I really do think it's even funnier a year later.
01:02:04 I really do.
01:02:05 Yeah, the joke's old and nobody cares anymore.
01:02:08 And that just makes it better.
01:02:13 Honestly, I mean, it shouldn't have taken so long.
01:02:17 But I kind of, with the COVID and everything involved
01:02:21 in between in 2020, it's a little understandable
01:02:26 that it took so long for all this stuff to get
01:02:28 to this point was really done.
01:02:31 I think when people see the OP,
01:02:33 they will understand why it took this long.
01:02:36 Yeah, I mean, it was a double whammy of adding
01:02:40 so much stuff at the 11th hour that's
01:02:41 beyond the scope of what we usually do for these
01:02:43 and COVID being a thing.
01:02:45 That's true.
01:02:46 So, you know, we're still making it happen,
01:02:50 though.
01:02:50 Progress is being made.
01:02:52 We have not abandoned anything.
01:02:54 So, stay tuned, my dudes.
01:02:58 Yes, yes, yes.
01:03:02 You heard it here first, folks.
01:03:03 Ben's done with Noida.
01:03:04 That means CWC 102 any day now, I'm sure.
01:03:08 We respect you for giving us money.
01:03:11 No statements to the contrary apply
01:03:14 or are officially acknowledged in any PCP context.
01:03:19 I mean, unironically, it's really humbling to think,
01:03:23 like, oh my God, that was a lot of fucking money.
01:03:27 Yeah, no, it was so crazy.
01:03:29 It's crazy.
01:03:30 I couldn't believe that it was still going out.
01:03:33 So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:03:34 Like, that livestream was-
01:03:35 There's a huge, like, humbling and responsibility
01:03:39 to make sure that this stuff is done
01:03:41 to the best of our abilities.
01:03:42 So, for sure.
01:03:44 I mean, I mean, I don't know.
01:03:46 I think it's, I think we've hit a point where,
01:03:52 I mean, there's probably a lot of people,
01:03:54 honestly, a lot of people that probably, like,
01:03:56 haven't even kept up with the PCP since then.
01:03:59 And I think a lot of people might just not expect
01:04:05 of it to come out anymore.
01:04:06 And I feel like when it does come out,
01:04:08 and there's like, oh my God, there is actual content.
01:04:10 It was produced.
01:04:12 It does exist.
01:04:13 I think people will be shocked.
01:04:16 And I think we've hit a point where now it will feel
01:04:19 like it's just free, like they had already given up on it,
01:04:22 but now it does exist.
01:04:23 And it's like, oh, this is just free.
01:04:25 I expected nothing at this point, but now I've got this.
01:04:28 Yeah, the Kickstarter backers,
01:04:29 they backed the crypto, the PCPenny,
01:04:32 and it crashed immediately.
01:04:33 It's been low the entire time.
01:04:35 But now, now it's going to surge.
01:04:36 It's going to go right to the moon.
01:04:38 Just like, good ol' XRP.
01:04:40 It's time to go to patreon.com.
01:04:41 That's the procrastinators and invest in the PCPenny.
01:04:45 You will not be able to exchange it for USD.
01:04:50 You won't need USD soon.
01:04:51 When the entire American economy crashes,
01:04:53 you're going to be happy that your assets
01:04:54 are locked and safe in PCPenny's.
01:04:57 It's a great hedge against inflation.
01:05:00 The People's Currency.
01:05:02 That's what the PC stands for, the People's Currency Penny.
01:05:06 People's Currency Penny.
01:05:08 It's the People's Currency Penny, Penny,
01:05:10 because it's a...
01:05:11 Wait, no, it's PCPenny.
01:05:12 No, I'm sorry.
01:05:13 It's not the PCPenny.
01:05:15 Yeah, you got it.
01:05:16 You got it.
01:05:19 Do we want to go to voicemail?
01:05:21 Is it too early for that?
01:05:22 I mean, we'll be going for like an hour.
01:05:23 Yeah, we'll be going for an hour.
01:05:26 Hmm.
01:05:26 Do I have anything else to say?
01:05:28 I could read more shitty stuff that Trixie said.
01:05:32 I mean, I've got more screenshots of shit that made me mad.
01:05:35 I feel like we've made our point.
01:05:36 As much as it was like a shit show.
01:05:39 Oh, but there's some good stuff here, though.
01:05:40 Oh, but there's some real infuriating shit here, though.
01:05:43 I mean, it's all in the chat
01:05:44 if anybody really wants to dig into it.
01:05:46 Well, only Kickstarter backers are in that chat.
01:05:49 So, like, we're broadcasting it to a large audience.
01:05:52 I guess I just assumed everybody
01:05:53 who's listening to it at this point is a Kickstarter backer.
01:05:56 Somebody said, like, this is the content we paid for.
01:06:00 And you know what?
01:06:01 If they feel that way, then I condone that.
01:06:07 Enjoy it.
01:06:08 Lol.
01:06:09 Okay, all right.
01:06:10 Pulling victory from the jaws of defeat.
01:06:12 I like that attitude.
01:06:14 That's, yeah, that's really making lemonade, you know?
01:06:19 It's true.
01:06:20 Yeah.
01:06:21 Like that girl with brain cancer.
01:06:24 Uh...
01:06:24 See that?
01:06:25 There was a...
01:06:26 I don't know if it was in Brain Can.
01:06:27 There was some feel-good story going around Twitter
01:06:30 about, like, this girl needs, like, multiple brain surgeries
01:06:34 because she's got, like, horrible seizures
01:06:36 that are going to kill her if she doesn't get them.
01:06:38 So, she's selling lemonade to pay for the operation.
01:06:41 What a heartwarming story.
01:06:42 Wait, what?
01:06:44 Yeah, this was, like, all over this week.
01:06:47 This week?
01:06:48 Yeah, brain surgery, back lemonade.
01:06:52 Is terrifying.
01:06:54 Alabama girl, seven years old, selling lemonade
01:06:57 to help pay for her brain surgery.
01:06:59 Holy shit.
01:07:00 Liza Scott.
01:07:02 Yeah, I hope, quote, I hope I make it.
01:07:06 Yup, me too.
01:07:10 Fuck yeah.
01:07:10 You can't see it, but I'm, like, I'm making a very shot.
01:07:13 USA.
01:07:14 USA.
01:07:15 USA.
01:07:17 Fucking epic.
01:07:18 US game.
01:07:20 I can see it on, like, ABC.
01:07:21 Like, heartwarming, you know, and then the title
01:07:23 of the article.
01:07:24 That's what you call picking yourself up by your bootstraps.
01:07:29 You know what else is heartwarming?
01:07:31 An iron, like, heated, what do you call it?
01:07:35 Swarm.
01:07:35 An iron poker to the heart, like, stab?
01:07:38 Like, it's heartwarming.
01:07:40 Okay, that was, I failed the time.
01:07:41 No, I got it.
01:07:42 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I get it.
01:07:43 No, it was good.
01:07:45 No, no, no, no.
01:07:45 No, it was funny.
01:07:46 No, it was just shivering.
01:07:47 Come on, it was funny.
01:07:47 It was good.
01:07:48 No, you did.
01:07:48 No, I got it.
01:07:49 Now I'm going to cry.
01:07:51 I'm gonna cry and it's your fault.
01:07:54 Yes.
01:07:55 Yes.
01:07:56 Yes.
01:07:57 Um, voicemail?
01:07:58 We could start.
01:07:59 Yeah.
01:08:00 Yeah.
01:08:01 Okay.
01:08:02 Are you ready?
01:08:03 You got them up?
01:08:04 I gotta go get a speed pipe.
01:08:05 Okay.
01:08:06 It looks like the first one here is called Dag the Food Science Guy Solves Your Gummy
01:08:10 Worm Woes, which I hope to God means he's going to tell me where I can affordably purchase
01:08:16 some fucking-
01:08:17 Oh no, I'm not logged in.
01:08:18 Uh.
01:08:19 I am you fuck.
01:08:21 You bitch.
01:08:23 Yeah, no, it's completely warranted.
01:08:26 I'm sorry.
01:08:28 Eleazar, put some cool elevator music while I'm trying to get the password again.
01:08:33 This always makes me chuckle.
01:08:37 Put in um-
01:08:38 Please add more storage to your account.
01:08:40 You've used one gigabyte of the 100 megabytes total.
01:08:44 Eleazar, put in the song with me and Gib samples.
01:08:48 That one.
01:08:49 Play that.
01:08:50 That's the waiting song.
01:08:54 Remember that one?
01:08:55 Huh?
01:08:56 The one that's like, I don't even remember what we're saying in it.
01:09:01 Yeah.
01:09:02 All right, I did it.
01:09:03 I did it.
01:09:04 I found it.
01:09:05 Okay.
01:09:06 Okay, Dag the Food Science Guy Solves Your Gummy Worm Woes in three, two, one, go.
01:09:10 All right, when people are giving advice and they wait until the very end of something
01:09:16 like this to give the useful bit of information.
01:09:18 So right up front.
01:09:19 Oh, you?
01:09:20 Okay.
01:09:21 All you need to know is that, Ben, your gummy worms are not coming out consistently because
01:09:25 you are measuring by volume and not by weight.
01:09:28 Conceptually, it's kind of hard to wrap your head around at first.
01:09:33 No, it's not hard to wrap my head around.
01:09:35 I understand the differences.
01:09:36 Different substances are going to be ground to different levels of fineness.
01:09:38 I hate you.
01:09:39 I hate you.
01:09:40 And so more, the finer it is ground.
01:09:42 I have a fucking degree in physics.
01:09:44 I understand the difference between volume and mass.
01:09:47 Bits.
01:09:48 To be fair, that is hard to believe.
01:09:49 Things can affect this.
01:09:50 Like, if you live in a particularly humid climate.
01:09:54 No, okay, that's it.
01:09:55 No more particles.
01:09:56 No more.
01:09:57 I get it.
01:09:58 I get it.
01:10:00 I know the difference.
01:10:02 Was I being sloppy?
01:10:04 Yes.
01:10:05 We got to be more science.
01:10:08 But if I'm using, okay, if I'm using the same like brand of sugar, say, same brand of sugar,
01:10:16 for instance, and I, and I'm at the same altitude, right?
01:10:21 And I take like a scoop, like a half cup of sugar is not going to radically change you
01:10:29 like one day to the next, like what the mass of that is, you know?
01:10:35 I don't know.
01:10:36 Maybe I'm just making excuses.
01:10:38 Yeah, just put in a measuring bowl, idiot.
01:10:42 Well, that would be fine.
01:10:43 Not a measuring bowl and a scale.
01:10:46 I do actually have, I did buy, I did buy a new mini scale, not for worms.
01:10:53 Actually, I bought a scale for weighing packages and envelopes so that I would know how much
01:10:59 postage to use for RFCK merch stuff and vapors stuff.
01:11:05 So I have a scale.
01:11:07 So, you know what, Dag?
01:11:08 I'll give it to you.
01:11:09 You're probably right.
01:11:10 You're probably right that I should be measuring by, by mass.
01:11:14 Yes.
01:11:15 Fine.
01:11:16 Very well.
01:11:18 Next one is called Origin of Lol Cow.
01:11:21 Three, two, one, go.
01:11:24 The term Lol Cow actually comes from farming.
01:11:26 You see, there's this thing called the rape rack or they used to call it that.
01:11:29 Now they're shifting to more PC terminology, but you know, it's the rape rack where once
01:11:33 a year dairy cows, they're tied to it.
01:11:35 The farmer forcibly impregnates them, shoves their whole arm inside, you know, squeeze
01:11:39 a little syringe of bull semen.
01:11:41 And you may think, oh, it's a little harsh to call that rape.
01:11:43 I mean, like technically, and you're right to say that actually because when it happens,
01:11:47 the cows go, lol, because they think it's really funny.
01:11:50 That's where the term Lol Cow comes from because cows like it when we rape them over,
01:11:54 over again every year.
01:11:55 Wow.
01:11:56 And what's even more funny to them is that once the calf is born, after like three days
01:12:00 or not even, sometimes immediately, we just take the calf away and the mom is like,
01:12:04 wailing.
01:12:05 But it's not actually wailing.
01:12:06 It's that she's laughing really hard because she thinks it's so funny that we do this to
01:12:10 them over and over on an annual basis until they die.
01:12:15 That's cool.
01:12:17 Pretty funny.
01:12:18 Pretty good.
01:12:19 I'm all on about it.
01:12:21 I'm having a, I'm having a sensible chuckle over here.
01:12:26 The more you know you, I'm looking at this diagram like Googled rape rack.
01:12:32 I guess it is a thing.
01:12:33 Why?
01:12:34 Why would you?
01:12:35 And this is a diagram of a cow's innards.
01:12:38 That just seems like a dangerous term to search for just in general.
01:12:43 You know you're right, but it's too late and I can't unring this bell.
01:12:48 Thank you.
01:12:49 Thank you for posting that in the chat.
01:12:50 I didn't need to see it, but.
01:12:52 Amazon's already like suggesting you to buy your own.
01:12:57 My own what?
01:12:58 Rape rack?
01:12:59 Yeah.
01:13:00 Okay.
01:13:01 Well, hmm, you know, I mean, well, I mean, maybe if I make enough Bitcoin, uh, profits
01:13:07 than, uh, okay.
01:13:10 Next one is called Ben.
01:13:11 This is an intervention.
01:13:12 Your alcoholism is killing you.
01:13:15 Three, two, one, go.
01:13:19 Ben, this is an intervention.
01:13:21 Your alcoholism is killing you.
01:13:22 If you die, it won't even be based.
01:13:26 I feel like this is old because I have not been drinking, uh, recently.
01:13:32 Like a few months ago, I was drinking a lot, but mostly this year I have not been.
01:13:38 So.
01:13:39 Sounds like, uh, like an alcoholic in denial.
01:13:41 Ben.
01:13:42 No, no, you gotta, you gotta be lucid to make those like quick trades, uh, for Bitcoin.
01:13:46 You got, you guy comes in.
01:13:48 He's like, Oh, I haven't been drinking and you're just like, Hmm, this is an alcoholic
01:13:52 in denial.
01:13:53 Quit denying it.
01:13:54 Don't hold them down and pour a beer down a store.
01:13:56 Accept it.
01:13:57 Accept your alcoholism.
01:13:59 Stop denying it.
01:14:01 So you're doing right now.
01:14:04 Don't accept who you are.
01:14:06 Exactly what an alcoholic would say.
01:14:08 Just be the best.
01:14:09 If I drink in a beer.
01:14:11 Just be the best alcoholic you can be.
01:14:14 Uh, next.
01:14:15 Drink all the alcohol.
01:14:17 Next voicemail is called, I, I was tempted, I was tempted this weekend.
01:14:21 I was tempted this weekend.
01:14:22 Want to drink heavily.
01:14:23 Ben, I kept.
01:14:24 Yeah, I was tempted to go get another, another, my, my classic two bottles of barefoot bubbly
01:14:30 brute cuvée.
01:14:31 Fucking alcoholic.
01:14:32 Fucking alcoholic.
01:14:33 I didn't do it.
01:14:34 I didn't do it.
01:14:35 Something distracted me.
01:14:36 Probably, probably Noida.
01:14:37 You know what?
01:14:38 I, I is Noida.
01:14:39 Well, you know, now that I'm over Noida, um, back on the sauce, I'll probably get, I'll
01:14:44 probably get back on the sauce.
01:14:46 By the way, um, tectonic improv.
01:14:49 Uh, recommended me a video by a discount gum shoe about Noida where he talks about
01:14:56 it and its themes.
01:14:58 And I thought it was a good video.
01:15:00 And so I guess I might as well shout it out.
01:15:03 Um, go, uh, it's, it's called, um, I don't remember what it's called, but it's by discount
01:15:10 gum shoe.
01:15:11 Uh, I liked it because he was like, lol, good game.
01:15:18 Sounds good.
01:15:19 No, cause he talked, he taught, he talks about, I mean the, the, the, the, the coolest thing
01:15:28 about it is he says like, yeah, I was playing the game.
01:15:30 I was trying to win.
01:15:31 I was trying to win, but then it was too hard and I gave up on winning.
01:15:35 So I just was like, fuck it.
01:15:37 And I didn't go down the main path and I went exploring again and I went like, hmm, what
01:15:41 if I don't go into the mountain?
01:15:42 I'll just go left.
01:15:43 Oh my God.
01:15:44 What the fuck is over here?
01:15:45 I'll just go right.
01:15:46 Oh my God.
01:15:47 I can go up like, oh my God, there's shit up here.
01:15:50 Like what the fuck?
01:15:51 There's so much more to this game than I thought.
01:15:53 Like this, this world is like bigger than I thought it was.
01:15:58 And now like the next time I go and I go down the holy mountain, it's like, I have a completely
01:16:02 new outlook on it.
01:16:03 I, I Google one that is like, uh, discount gum shoe on YouTube and I can't see their
01:16:08 account.
01:16:09 Is there a way to spell it?
01:16:12 Um, I think it's all one word.
01:16:14 Oh, maybe that's it.
01:16:17 Oh, there it is.
01:16:19 Yeah.
01:16:20 It's, it's called, wait, no, I didn't mean to make this like a whole diversion, but
01:16:26 now I'm, I'm irritated.
01:16:29 Wait.
01:16:30 That was a year ago.
01:16:31 No, it's the author as God.
01:16:33 Yes.
01:16:34 That's it.
01:16:35 Um, yeah.
01:16:36 I didn't, he made that video.
01:16:37 It's from like, like early 2020, uh, I guess it's been out for a while.
01:16:43 I see videos sometimes talking about like features and like, yeah, I guess it was like
01:16:48 an early access for a while and I guess it's been out for a bit.
01:16:52 They keep adding stuff, uh, and actually there's more stuff being added now, like on the beta
01:16:58 branch, there's all these new like structures that are being added to old biomes and there's
01:17:02 like new spells and spell modifiers and stuff.
01:17:05 And there's like new secrets and, uh, it's pretty cool, but I'm not playing the beta
01:17:09 branch.
01:17:10 So I haven't really fucked with any of it.
01:17:12 Um, okay, uh, no, no more noise to talk enough, enough.
01:17:18 Um, this next voicemail is called PCP crunch mail three, two, one, go.
01:17:24 Okay.
01:17:25 So I don't know if I'm a bigot, but something about Digi not wanting to be called Digi anymore
01:17:30 and deleting all of her videos makes me like viscerally angry.
01:17:35 Like no, you're dumb.
01:17:36 Just be called Digi something Digi.
01:17:38 Nay.
01:17:39 I don't care.
01:17:41 I'm going to end this voicemail by eating chips.
01:17:43 Nice.
01:17:44 Very good.
01:17:46 Um, well, the, the, I think the only thing that's bad about the taking down of all the
01:17:55 videos is that she said three weeks and it wasn't three weeks.
01:17:59 Oh, that's really bad.
01:18:01 Yeah.
01:18:02 She said that happened.
01:18:03 Yeah.
01:18:04 She said, she said three weeks and then after like 11 days or something, she just like,
01:18:08 ah, fuck it.
01:18:09 She just did it.
01:18:10 Lol.
01:18:11 Which is like the, you said, you just, you said it like you give people the time.
01:18:19 And then, okay, since, since you bring that up, I got to mention the thing she said in
01:18:23 the radcon server where someone was like, Hey, you said that and you broke your word.
01:18:28 And she said, uh, she said, uh, uh, you should never take anyone at their word.
01:18:35 Like why didn't you just like, why didn't you just expect me to lie?
01:18:37 Like what are you stupid?
01:18:39 Like it's your fault for believing me, idiot.
01:18:41 Lol.
01:18:42 Uh, really cool.
01:18:44 Disavow.
01:18:45 Disavow.
01:18:46 It was, it was just like, I don't know, the, the taking down of all the videos because
01:18:50 you don't feel right having them.
01:18:51 I always, I'm always on the side of the person to be able to do that at any time.
01:18:58 There's no, there's no like, um, you know, obligation, moral or legal or anything to keep
01:19:06 yourself broadcasting forever.
01:19:09 You can just stop and delete it all.
01:19:11 Um, I just disagree with the whole not doing the one thing you said you would do to allow
01:19:16 people to save the videos they like.
01:19:19 I think, I mean, I think deleting the videos is cringe.
01:19:25 It's not that she can't, it's that I think she must not do it.
01:19:29 I think it's cringe.
01:19:30 I also think it doesn't make any sense because it's going to cost her a lot of money for
01:19:33 no gain at all.
01:19:35 Uh, and I mean, that's, those are my thoughts on channel deletion.
01:19:42 We don't know exactly what the gain is in, in like, I don't know, mental state or whatever,
01:19:46 but you know.
01:19:48 I suppose.
01:19:49 Yeah.
01:19:50 Yeah.
01:19:51 Yeah.
01:19:52 That made sure whatever.
01:19:53 And I mean, uh, she, uh, I don't, I mean, I disagree that she doesn't have to keep going
01:19:59 by Digi if she doesn't want to.
01:20:01 You know, if she, I mean, I can understand if they're named people change their brand
01:20:05 all the time.
01:20:06 Yeah.
01:20:07 I mean, if like, it's a, it's a brand that's been around for like what, like a decade at
01:20:10 this point.
01:20:11 So of course, like if you've been following, you know, Trixie's content for this entire
01:20:15 time, like it's probably going to be weird to be like, Oh, like, like I'm just mentally
01:20:20 like associating this person with Digi bro, like that's just just, that's just ingrained
01:20:25 in my head.
01:20:26 But like, that's not too hard to get over, um, you know, like we've been saying Trixie
01:20:31 this whole time and like we've known them for like 10 years, like literally talk pretty
01:20:37 frequently.
01:20:38 So, um, but I don't know.
01:20:41 I mean, in terms of like deleting the videos and stuff, like that's obviously, you know,
01:20:45 her prerogative, do whatever you want with your content.
01:20:47 I think it was probably not a great call to delete it early.
01:20:52 And I'm also not really sure why, like a lot of people were saying, like in the comments
01:20:57 of that video, why not just start a new channel?
01:21:00 That's what I would have done.
01:21:01 And I don't understand the, I don't, because you just want to keep that sub number around.
01:21:06 Yeah.
01:21:07 Okay.
01:21:08 Sure.
01:21:09 I understand that, but it's like, okay, I want to shed my old audience and get a new
01:21:16 audience.
01:21:17 It's like, well, then what is more sensible audience that you are?
01:21:21 Cause like the only thing you're doing is inviting, inviting, you know, people to like
01:21:25 react badly to the new content.
01:21:27 Whereas we have a new platform from scratch.
01:21:28 You're starting fresh.
01:21:29 Yeah.
01:21:30 That's literally saying I want the old people to see the new content by putting it here
01:21:34 where they are.
01:21:35 Maybe there's something I'm missing, but it seems like it seems we're going against
01:21:40 the stated goal.
01:21:41 But like, I mean, it's nice that 300 K numbers really comfy and you don't want to let it
01:21:46 go.
01:21:47 So I get that.
01:21:48 Sure.
01:21:49 Sure.
01:21:50 But functionally at this point, it probably doesn't mean much, you know?
01:21:53 I mean, practically, if I were just trying to, if I were in that situation and I were
01:21:58 just like, okay, I don't want to be Digi bro anymore.
01:22:01 I don't want to be Digi anymore.
01:22:02 I want to rebrand.
01:22:05 And I also don't want to be fucked.
01:22:08 What I would do is leave that channel, could just, just continue to accrue, you know, ad
01:22:14 revenue from views on that old channel and start a new channel and just like leave it
01:22:19 there.
01:22:20 Like, yeah, that's Digi content.
01:22:22 That's what it was.
01:22:23 I'm not Digi anymore.
01:22:24 I'm over here doing this thing.
01:22:26 But like that stuff is still benefiting me.
01:22:30 I mean, even if like you're uncomfortable, like with like that, you know, phaser life
01:22:34 being active on the internet, like you can, you can private all that still, but like I
01:22:38 would still start a new channel as opposed to like trying to keep that one going at this
01:22:42 point.
01:22:43 I gotta say, I agree, but it's hard to get that being said, hope it works out.
01:22:50 Like I think maybe it was like, oh, in order to get a monetization on a new channel, you
01:22:56 have to get a certain amount of views and over a certain time and it was just easier
01:23:00 to use a currently existing channel.
01:23:02 So I don't know.
01:23:04 She could get, she could get thousands of views, which is what she's getting on her void
01:23:11 gazer stuff on the old channel.
01:23:12 She could get thousands of views on any new channel she made just by tweeting about it,
01:23:17 just by like saying or making a video on the old channel saying, I'm here now.
01:23:22 Like I don't know that audience, that core audience that will watch that will follow
01:23:25 her to any new place she goes, it is there.
01:23:29 So I forget the point I was making.
01:23:33 It doesn't matter.
01:23:35 Is it?
01:23:36 Yeah.
01:23:37 Yeah.
01:23:38 Whatever.
01:23:39 Was there anything else about that voicemail?
01:23:41 No, I think we said it all.
01:23:44 I'm glad you enjoyed your chips.
01:23:45 I'm like he was enjoying those chips at the end.
01:23:47 So I got some, I got some chips today.
01:23:52 I got some Parmesan crisps.
01:23:53 Oh, I had some of those literally earlier today.
01:23:57 Are you keto?
01:23:58 I'm back on keto.
01:23:59 Yeah.
01:24:00 Nice.
01:24:01 I got.
01:24:02 Okay.
01:24:03 Last time I ordered from Costco, I got some stuff that I'd never had before and it was
01:24:06 really good.
01:24:07 It was called moon cheese.
01:24:08 Do you know what that is?
01:24:09 No, I've never heard of that.
01:24:11 It's literally just like freeze dried cheese, but it's not cold.
01:24:15 You know, it's room temperature, but it's like dried into these sort of little like
01:24:19 puff like balls, but it's just cheese that's been sort of like flash frozen into these
01:24:23 little like crunchy pieces and you just eat it and it's good.
01:24:27 But then they were out.
01:24:28 I tried to order some again and they were out.
01:24:30 So instead I got these Parmesan crisps and they're pretty good too.
01:24:33 They're good.
01:24:35 The next voicemail is called bane will find him three, two, one, go.
01:24:41 You're probably wondering who would come in a man before throwing him out of a plane.
01:24:48 That would be the league, of course.
01:24:52 Oh, no.
01:24:53 No.
01:24:54 No matter who we are, really, what matters is our plan, our plan to fuck Nate.
01:25:02 You see, once I find him, it will be very painful for Nate.
01:25:14 These guys are always talking about their plans to fuck Nate and they haven't done
01:25:20 it yet.
01:25:21 They haven't even approached him.
01:25:22 Are these guys just at the league of incels like Nate incels?
01:25:26 Where's their game?
01:25:28 You know?
01:25:29 Where's their result?
01:25:30 If they want to threaten Nate, shouldn't they be like messaging content?
01:25:33 Nate's not around these parts anymore.
01:25:36 We've been sending them over in like paper or plain form.
01:25:43 I don't know.
01:25:44 I'm wondering now if maybe it is, maybe it's all just a bunch of empty posturing.
01:25:47 At some point, you have to put up or shut up.
01:25:51 After a while, if Nate remains unfucked, I have to question your dedication.
01:25:55 There's a whole league behind this and he's just too, like, too.
01:26:00 What's the word?
01:26:00 He's unfuck, he's unfuckable.
01:26:02 He's unfuckable.
01:26:02 He's like the Chastity Belt, like is like like 10 psych locks.
01:26:10 Nobody knows that reference.
01:26:12 I don't.
01:26:13 Damn.
01:26:14 People in the comments say, say, lol, if you, if you lulled.
01:26:18 Do you want to?
01:26:19 What is it?
01:26:21 It's Phoenix, right?
01:26:21 Psych locks?
01:26:22 Phoenix, right?
01:26:23 OK, like a personalized, then the psych locks.
01:26:26 Oh, oh, oh, yeah, I remember.
01:26:30 I remember.
01:26:31 We got to grab, we got to grab one of my thirty five cans of Coke Zero that I got
01:26:37 from Costco today.
01:26:38 This is number.
01:26:40 Oh, God, I'm on five already.
01:26:43 Hmm.
01:26:44 Yikes, Coke Zero.
01:26:45 Ben still does have a drinking problem.
01:26:47 It's just not alcohol anymore.
01:26:49 Glad we cleared that up.
01:26:51 Absolutely.
01:26:52 He just loves those liquids.
01:26:54 You can't get enough.
01:26:54 Oh, I bought.
01:26:56 I bought some.
01:26:57 I keep going on these keto tangents, but I ordered some like non-sugar candy from
01:27:04 a brand called Behave.
01:27:06 I ordered like a box of them and didn't like them.
01:27:10 Smart sweets are better, I think.
01:27:12 So Behave is like, it's fine, like it's OK.
01:27:15 I try not to buy any specifically keto branded product because they're always way
01:27:21 too expensive.
01:27:22 Well, these are not called keto.
01:27:23 They're just low, low sugar.
01:27:27 But I mean, they are overpriced for what they are.
01:27:29 Yeah, it was it was literally it was like $48 for like twelve bags of the stuff.
01:27:35 Oh, my God.
01:27:37 It's like, have you seen the ads for that like keto cereal that's like seven
01:27:41 dollars for a tiny box?
01:27:42 And I'm just like, how dare you to sell my intelligence?
01:27:44 I haven't seen those.
01:27:45 And all I can think is like boxes of cereal are so small to begin with.
01:27:51 Right, like I in the past I have bought a little box like you can buy the big
01:27:55 like family sized ones, but if you just buy like a normal box of cereal,
01:27:58 like the meat, the normal size, that's like three bowls for me.
01:28:02 It really is. Yeah, it's not much.
01:28:04 And I'm sure that these fucking keto cereals are even less.
01:28:08 So I can only imagine like spreading that across like two breakfasts.
01:28:13 It's probably like two bowls at best.
01:28:16 Yeah, yeah.
01:28:19 Uh, the next bowl.
01:28:20 This is this capitalism, am I right?
01:28:24 Yeah, fuck them.
01:28:25 Next voicemail is called Jenkins jinkies three, two, one, go.
01:28:33 Shekels for heckles when asking for a friend.
01:28:37 Oh, we haven't done one in like three weeks or something.
01:28:42 I'm so busy.
01:28:44 Oh, I mean, I can I can always do one, but I haven't been thinking about it.
01:28:50 I haven't been thinking about it.
01:28:52 I think I said this last time.
01:28:54 How did you play so much?
01:28:55 Noida and not Shekels for heckles it at all.
01:28:57 You know, you know what?
01:28:59 You know what?
01:29:00 I would love to do a Noida Shekels for heckles.
01:29:02 That would be fun and cool.
01:29:04 Let's do we want to do that maybe this week?
01:29:06 I don't have the game, so I'll just be sitting in the cool watching.
01:29:09 But yeah, I can I can stream it.
01:29:11 Yeah, I mean, it's a single player game.
01:29:14 Uh, if we want maybe if we want to do it this.
01:29:19 Should wait, we should say let's say that we'll do it the week after this comes out.
01:29:25 All right. Sure.
01:29:27 So we want to say like the the Wednesday after this episode airs,
01:29:31 we will do a Noida Shekels for heckles.
01:29:34 I can I can.
01:29:35 So the 10th, March 10th.
01:29:39 Yes, March 10th.
01:29:42 Noida Shekels, baby.
01:29:46 That's so far in the future.
01:29:47 Ha, ha, I'm going to sneak up on you.
01:29:51 No, no, no, never forget, never.
01:29:54 I can never forget Noida.
01:29:55 By then, I'll be a God.
01:29:57 I'll be such a guy.
01:29:58 Wait, I got to tell you about this one.
01:29:59 I got to tell you about this one I found.
01:30:01 Got to save it for the stream.
01:30:04 No, OK, I will probably rave about this.
01:30:08 This was like this was an incredible early game find.
01:30:10 And I still lost.
01:30:12 Well, next voicemail is called Blingus Keningus.
01:30:17 Three, two, one, go.
01:30:21 Konichiwa.
01:30:22 During last week's episode, it seems our friend
01:30:25 Kringus Bingus was facing a bit of an existential struggle.
01:30:29 Ganbare, Kringus Bingus.
01:30:31 Yeah.
01:30:32 Questions you pondered once stuck out to me.
01:30:35 What do Martin Lawrence and Sonic the Hedgehog have in common?
01:30:39 Well, Fred, no more for this is one predicament I can lay to rest.
01:30:45 What Martin Lawrence and Sonic the Hedgehog have in common
01:30:48 is that they have both starred in a feature titled The Black Knight.
01:30:53 Anyway, pledge to my Patreon at Patreon dot com slash PC Minecraft
01:30:58 and follow me on Twitter at Procrastinator's Minecraft.
01:31:01 Until next time.
01:31:02 Say, oh, no.
01:31:06 Oh, no.
01:31:08 Nala, what was he saying?
01:31:11 I don't know.
01:31:13 I guess they were both in Black Knight.
01:31:15 He said Martin Lawrence, but I pictured Lawrence Fishburne,
01:31:19 who is basically similar, essentially.
01:31:26 PC Minecraft, guys, I don't want to alarm you.
01:31:33 OK, forty five, forty five, three fifty five.
01:31:36 We're up another three hundo.
01:31:38 We're up another three hundo, baby.
01:31:40 Wait, huh? What?
01:31:42 Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
01:31:43 Sorry, I'm not glued to the Bitcoin screen.
01:31:46 I'm glued.
01:31:48 Thirty thirty five, thirty five.
01:31:50 Look, look at this.
01:31:51 Look at this.
01:31:53 Oh, yeah.
01:31:54 Look, look, look at this.
01:31:55 Look at this.
01:31:56 Until it's breaking fifty K again, I'm not interested.
01:31:58 Let me know when it hits fifty K again.
01:32:01 When I'm making a profit again, look, look at that meteoric rise.
01:32:05 I mean, look at it in the context of the week, though.
01:32:07 And it's like it's a snow.
01:32:10 I'm not going to do.
01:32:11 I'm not going to look at it in that context.
01:32:13 Like you, I choose not to do so.
01:32:16 Even for today, it has fallen so much.
01:32:19 No, shut up, shut up.
01:32:23 Wait, is that true?
01:32:24 What did it start the day at?
01:32:26 The day it started at fucking.
01:32:28 No, it's about it's about where it started.
01:32:32 It's gone down, but yeah.
01:32:34 Yeah, next voicemail is called Brony lecture correction.
01:32:40 OK, three, two, one, go.
01:32:44 Just want to clarify the voicemail I said last week
01:32:46 about the releasing the original blown in the lecture.
01:32:49 I didn't mean now and I didn't mean unedited.
01:32:53 What I meant was just don't get rid of or throw away
01:32:59 any of the original footage from what was recorded at Radcott.
01:33:03 That's all I was referring to,
01:33:04 because it's I'm sure that it's good shit and it's yeah, it is good shit.
01:33:08 We want like that's what everyone wants.
01:33:09 Everyone wants to see it is what everyone the lecture
01:33:12 that was recorded at Radcom with all of you guys there
01:33:15 listening in on the lecture.
01:33:16 That's what we want.
01:33:17 That's what it means.
01:33:17 Yeah, don't get rid of any of that shit.
01:33:20 Yeah, I'm I'm sorry.
01:33:23 I don't know what to tell you.
01:33:25 I've even I'm sorry that I can't do anything.
01:33:28 Yeah, I mean, it feels like that battle has been lost.
01:33:30 Digi has not in any way implied that she is getting rid of
01:33:35 the original footage that she she said over and over again.
01:33:38 She's going to no incorporated into a second video with new footage as well.
01:33:44 Lol, I don't know exactly what that's going to look like.
01:33:46 But you know, well, it won't look like the original,
01:33:50 which is what everyone wants.
01:33:52 I guess I guess the and also it will never happen.
01:33:55 Lamar, it's confusing how it's like all the original footage
01:33:59 is going to be in this new version, but you can't see the original footage.
01:34:03 It's like it's it's it's it's I mean, literally.
01:34:07 It doesn't make any sense.
01:34:08 We still don't have what these edits are totally insane.
01:34:11 So maybe it'll make sense five years from now.
01:34:14 When there were actually comes out.
01:34:15 But if it were ever going to come out in any form,
01:34:18 there would be no problem showing the backers the raw footage, you know.
01:34:23 Yeah. Yeah.
01:34:26 Sorry, everyone. I'm sorry.
01:34:28 I wish I could do something, but I can't.
01:34:32 Well, next voicemail is called any hole is a Smeagol.
01:34:38 Three to three to one go.
01:34:42 Words to live by.
01:34:43 My precious.
01:34:46 Oh, my precious is gone.
01:34:50 I miss my precious.
01:34:53 I know where this is going.
01:34:55 Yeah. Miss you, Nate.
01:34:59 You're delicious.
01:35:00 Vain cook.
01:35:03 I miss it.
01:35:04 I'm shaving pure.
01:35:06 It's really sexy.
01:35:09 My precious.
01:35:11 Nate, I miss that one stray hair
01:35:17 hidden underneath the hood.
01:35:19 I miss the crustiness of the forest.
01:35:24 It's too real.
01:35:25 If you're listening, please tell me.
01:35:29 Do you want my pinkies in your urethra's?
01:35:35 Do you want me to slide my
01:35:38 ricofinger into your cock hole?
01:35:41 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's see where this is going.
01:35:43 A precious cock wheel for Nate.
01:35:49 The one you mean.
01:35:52 My anus
01:35:55 forged in the fires of Mount Coombe.
01:36:02 That was too good of an impression.
01:36:04 I'm saying all of that.
01:36:06 Oh, I could see it.
01:36:07 I can see him saying it.
01:36:09 Yeah, unfortunately, I can see it.
01:36:12 I could smell his breath
01:36:15 and crawling all over me and delivering this monologue.
01:36:20 It's like all the voicemails to be highly produced
01:36:23 that had to be that one.
01:36:25 It's like it's like that ride at Disneyland
01:36:27 when the Disney World where the alien breaks out of the thing
01:36:30 and like the like the the the the leathery wings
01:36:33 and like it breathes on you.
01:36:35 It's like that. It's like that.
01:36:39 Thanks for the voicemail.
01:36:40 You know, he didn't he didn't say he was part of the League, though.
01:36:44 That's true.
01:36:45 He could be a competing force.
01:36:47 Smeagol and Gollum.
01:36:48 They were always on their own.
01:36:49 Yeah, I select it.
01:36:51 Yeah, renegades.
01:36:54 Precious cock ring.
01:36:57 Like my anus forced in the fires of Mount Coombe.
01:37:02 Mount Coombe's pretty good.
01:37:03 Salvaged it right at the end.
01:37:05 That was pretty good.
01:37:06 Yeah, a real cherry on top.
01:37:08 No pun intended.
01:37:09 I just want to listen to it like a sex ridden load of the rings.
01:37:13 No, no, no, no, get out of here.
01:37:17 No, it's just you really want that.
01:37:19 I'm sure it already exists,
01:37:20 but it's just so silly.
01:37:22 OK, fine.
01:37:24 I don't I don't I don't plan to enjoy it.
01:37:26 I just is funny. OK.
01:37:30 Sherry, I just want to watch it ironically.
01:37:32 Promise. Hmm.
01:37:34 Next voicemail is called you're the reason I can't stop stealing.
01:37:38 I'm not meming three, two, one, go.
01:37:42 Hey, I just wanted to let you know,
01:37:45 Ben, at one time that you talked about a shoplifting
01:37:50 made me rethink the way that I go about my spending my money.
01:37:55 And now, whenever I need food,
01:38:00 I tend to have a kleptomaniac problem.
01:38:04 So, yeah, ever since then, I haven't spent any money on food.
01:38:10 Any. See you. How?
01:38:12 I mean, that's that's a power move, my dude.
01:38:15 If you can if you can steal all of your food,
01:38:18 I'm impressed. Yeah.
01:38:22 I I mean, I have I have not been in any like stores in a while.
01:38:27 So like, I haven't stolen anything.
01:38:31 Yeah, for online shopping, you you go to checkout
01:38:35 and then at the last second, you like
01:38:39 void your credit card as as you do the thing.
01:38:42 And then it's like it goes through like, oh, oh, it's already being shipped.
01:38:45 Just like you place order and then you immediately go to your bank
01:38:48 and with half an A press, you file a fraudulent report
01:38:51 and you get your money back.
01:38:52 You have to hold down the mouse click
01:38:54 between when you say buy and then you go and you hold it down to your bank
01:38:58 and you say like dispute transaction.
01:39:00 It's got to be in one swift motion.
01:39:03 You have you have to do it in a single frame. Yeah, yeah.
01:39:09 Stealing stealing all of it.
01:39:10 Like, how do you do that? Like is he just eating like an apple?
01:39:13 That's it.
01:39:16 I mean, I mean, don't steal from mom and pops, preferably.
01:39:22 Yeah, don't I mean, don't get caught, I guess.
01:39:28 And if you can do both of those things, I say steal away.
01:39:31 Stealing is good. Thumbs up.
01:39:36 I was thinking about this.
01:39:37 I was thinking about this
01:39:40 just like yesterday, I was like,
01:39:44 I've talked about stealing before and how it's good.
01:39:47 I should say that again.
01:39:48 I should reiterate that, by the way,
01:39:50 don't forget that I think stealing is good, but I do.
01:39:55 So thanks.
01:39:56 Thanks, caller, for giving me the chance.
01:40:01 Next voicemail is called.
01:40:03 No, it's good. Not not.
01:40:04 Hey, no, what are you? What are you chicken?
01:40:06 What are you, pussy, huh? We not cool.
01:40:08 I think it's like morally OK to do that
01:40:11 if it's a large food business huge thing as opposed to a proper store.
01:40:17 The only like moral qualm I have about saying stealing is good
01:40:21 is that I worry that someone like this, who has by his own admission
01:40:25 was inspired to steal by me, might get in trouble if they get caught.
01:40:29 Like, I would I would really feel terrible if that were to happen.
01:40:32 Like, please.
01:40:33 Yes. Well, the more you say it, the bigger the chance
01:40:35 of that happening becomes.
01:40:37 So I know. And I'm saying like.
01:40:41 The most important thing is don't fucking get caught.
01:40:45 La Mal. Just just eat it in the store.
01:40:49 Yes, it's true. It's not a bad move.
01:40:53 Next voicemail, microphone, Michael, three, two, one, go.
01:40:58 Well, if it isn't me, microphone, Michael.
01:41:04 Damn, what a mic on this guy.
01:41:07 Am I right?
01:41:07 Me microphone named.
01:41:12 Michael. Yeah.
01:41:16 Microphones are slightly phallic shaped.
01:41:24 And you know what rhymes with shape?
01:41:29 Ben, shut the fuck up.
01:41:33 I'm going to fuck you for ever.
01:41:38 You're going to regret letting me on to this show.
01:41:43 I will fuck your brother in dough.
01:41:50 Oh, my God. In what?
01:41:51 Microphone, Michael turned into a fucking Palpatine at the end there.
01:41:55 He seemed like such a nice guy at first.
01:41:58 But then things took a turn.
01:42:00 Turn for the mic.
01:42:01 Give a shout out to the original microphone, Michael.
01:42:04 Mike, the microphone of Brony fame.
01:42:07 Oh, is that a musician?
01:42:09 Yeah. Yeah.
01:42:10 I remember the name.
01:42:12 I don't even.
01:42:13 It rings a bell.
01:42:15 I've heard the name, but I can't say I've ever met the man.
01:42:19 Remember, remember that?
01:42:21 Remember when that guy said that?
01:42:22 I remember somebody referencing it.
01:42:24 I don't know. It's from.
01:42:26 That's that's what that's what someone that's what Dr.
01:42:29 Wolf said when someone asked him about Endless Jess, he said, I've heard
01:42:33 no drowning in horseshoes.
01:42:34 I have heard the name, but I've never met the man.
01:42:38 I feel like he would have been referencing something else.
01:42:40 That's oh, my God.
01:42:41 You know what we didn't talk about?
01:42:43 Have you guys seen anything about G5?
01:42:45 G5 exploded this week.
01:42:46 Oh, wait.
01:42:48 I think I saw the like a screenshot and I hate how it looks.
01:42:52 There's tons of animated gifts and everything.
01:42:54 Yeah, I hate that it just it just looks like any.
01:42:57 It looks like some your normal Pixar shit.
01:43:00 Everything looks like that.
01:43:01 Every fucking movie looks like that.
01:43:02 And I hate it.
01:43:03 There's like one artist in the industry that does the eyes for every 3D thing ever.
01:43:07 They're exactly the same.
01:43:09 They did it to VeggieTales.
01:43:11 They did it to VeggieTales.
01:43:12 They gave them those same eyes.
01:43:13 It's fucked up.
01:43:14 There's do you remember?
01:43:15 Like God, this is going to be such an obscure reference
01:43:18 because I didn't even remember till someone pointed out.
01:43:20 Do you remember that like that like weirdly detailed painting of like
01:43:23 Celestia with like the really derpy looking face from like way back in the day.
01:43:28 It kind of had this like God, I'm never going to be able to find it.
01:43:31 It just like looked really stupid, but it was like a overly detailed painting.
01:43:36 God, I don't know. Maybe.
01:43:38 I'm not going to be able to find it.
01:43:40 I don't remember.
01:43:42 All I know is that the person who made that painting
01:43:44 worked on designing the ponies and this G5.
01:43:46 So let me we've really gone.
01:43:49 We've gone places.
01:43:51 I guess it's not that crazy to imagine.
01:43:53 Bronies from Gen 4 will be working on Gen 5.
01:43:57 It's been a 10 years.
01:43:58 I'm never going to be able to find it.
01:44:00 I'm really mad.
01:44:02 Yeah, but it was on Twitter and now it's just gone.
01:44:05 The I was looking at the they said there's a movie I'm right.
01:44:10 I'm right, though, right?
01:44:11 Like G5 just looks really generic, right?
01:44:13 It looks way less, way more generic than than G4, that's for sure.
01:44:17 The they had like a small post exclusive to some website.
01:44:23 And they had like a brief little bit of information
01:44:26 about the fact that there's going to be a movie coming out
01:44:28 and then a series to follow in the same animation style.
01:44:31 And the director is the guy who made cop out or something.
01:44:37 Cop out?
01:44:38 It's I don't know.
01:44:40 The movie, I think so.
01:44:42 I was looking at the names of the people involved.
01:44:44 The one the one that Mr. Plinkett like shield that one time
01:44:49 for the check in that joke with the fucking.
01:44:52 Oh, yeah, that was the one.
01:44:56 Or is it like a cop cop dog more like cop out?
01:44:59 I don't even know what that means.
01:45:02 Here is my only that's my only touch.
01:45:05 That's my only touch point for cop out.
01:45:07 Yeah, so I just wanted to know if like if there's any chance of it being good
01:45:11 because the only reason the Gen four was good was because Lauren Faust
01:45:15 really wanted it to be a good show and she pushed hard for that to happen.
01:45:19 So without her, without a similar voice in the next one,
01:45:22 it's probably just going to be exactly the same shit as, you know,
01:45:25 the the unwatchable garbage that was, well, I don't know, Gen three.
01:45:31 I never watched it, but I caught glimpses and it was not interesting.
01:45:36 I mean, I mean, it looks it looks it looks in motion
01:45:40 just like I thought it would from the screenshots.
01:45:43 I don't like the 3D look nearly as much as the 2D.
01:45:48 Oh, I don't think anyone would say that this looks better than Gen four.
01:45:51 Oh, found it.
01:45:53 All right, this is the picture I was talking about.
01:45:55 Let me get this, please, please.
01:45:57 I feel like I can almost picture what you're talking about.
01:46:02 I had to scroll up through another chat, but yeah, here we go.
01:46:08 That image.
01:46:09 Oh, my God.
01:46:10 That was wasn't that the the the logo for some musician, right?
01:46:15 I think it was at some point.
01:46:16 I don't know. It was that the fucking double chin or no chin, Celestia.
01:46:21 Some it was that one musician that Trixie was a big fan of who deleted
01:46:26 all their so powerful.
01:46:29 Yeah, yeah, so maybe I don't know if that was their icon,
01:46:32 but that so gap was the one I associate this image with that person.
01:46:37 But I could have misfired somewhere, I don't know.
01:46:43 Neat, neat.
01:46:44 This is like a haunting image, actually, it's great.
01:46:49 It's really good.
01:46:50 I unironically like it.
01:46:51 It's a little bit like, I don't know, like Richard's scary.
01:46:54 It's got that cursed image kind of vibe to it.
01:46:57 It just looks like deliberately made to be a little unsettling.
01:47:00 And I'm like, hmm, yeah, well done.
01:47:02 You did it like cryptid Celestia.
01:47:05 Yeah.
01:47:07 But yeah, like the response is pretty good so far.
01:47:10 Like people are making fan art for everything.
01:47:12 Like the fandom may rise from the ashes or the show could suck.
01:47:16 It'll be a fan.
01:47:18 I mean, it looks.
01:47:21 You know, I mean, it looks to me like it's high enough quality.
01:47:26 And it like, no, I can totally see the old bronies just jumping on this new bandwagon.
01:47:32 I don't. Yeah, like, why not?
01:47:34 Maybe.
01:47:37 Hmm.
01:47:38 I mean, if I were if I were still a brony and I saw this, I'd be like, yeah,
01:47:44 it's different, but it's still more pony stuff.
01:47:47 I'd be I'd probably be into it.
01:47:48 Yeah, it makes sense.
01:47:53 I really, really don't like the Pixar look, though.
01:47:56 I really hate that.
01:47:58 I might check out.
01:47:58 Shit, I might check out.
01:47:59 It's very derivative.
01:48:01 I want to I want to know.
01:48:02 I want to know if I like the new one just because why not?
01:48:06 Oh, I'm definitely going to watch the movie for sure.
01:48:08 Like I'm contractually obligated.
01:48:10 Why? I don't know.
01:48:12 Hey, though, I'm curious.
01:48:14 Brony curious.
01:48:15 Brony curious.
01:48:16 I'm for you.
01:48:17 Yes. Yeah, that's true.
01:48:18 That's true.
01:48:20 It's no shame.
01:48:21 There's no shame in watching a pony show just because it's an extreme.
01:48:24 No, there's no shame in it, but I wasn't going to do it.
01:48:28 Maybe it'll be good.
01:48:29 I don't know.
01:48:30 No, it's not.
01:48:32 Why would you think it would be good?
01:48:34 I've why would it be good?
01:48:35 There is a statistical chance that it could be good as small as it may be.
01:48:39 Yeah, we don't know everyone who's working on it.
01:48:41 It could be the people from the show or us.
01:48:44 I mean, actually, I don't know.
01:48:46 I think it's a different animation studio, a different studio altogether.
01:48:50 Yeah, last time a pony movie came out, we did a a PCP episode about it,
01:48:55 where we should we should do one about Gen five on our own.
01:48:58 I'm I'm ready.
01:48:59 I'm ready and willing to do another one.
01:49:02 When is it coming out?
01:49:04 I don't know, actually.
01:49:05 I don't think there's a really state is so little information.
01:49:09 I think it's soon.
01:49:10 It sounds like they're ramping up advertising, assuming it's not too far from now.
01:49:16 Fascinating. OK, well, we'll have to.
01:49:21 Offer roll up the old OCs for that one.
01:49:24 Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.
01:49:25 We should make three.
01:49:26 Tom, you can make 3D version of your Bernie Currier.
01:49:29 So see tall tales. Yes, yeah.
01:49:32 You can do that. You can make them all of us for free.
01:49:34 All right. Correct.
01:49:36 That's that's how it works.
01:49:38 Yeah. Nice.
01:49:40 It's like a low poly tall tales makes 3D video like with 3D glasses.
01:49:45 But then you I will pay you by the polygon.
01:49:50 OK, I'll just make a really low poly throw like a sub div on there.
01:49:53 Multiply it by like 15 X and charge you per polygon.
01:49:56 Just just make it a perfect sphere.
01:49:59 OK, that's still a lot of perfect smooth.
01:50:02 Yeah, exactly. That's how you would maximize profit.
01:50:05 You just make the smoothest sphere you can.
01:50:07 But I don't have my RTX 3060 Ti.
01:50:09 It won't handle those polygons. God damn it.
01:50:12 Oh, you're that's you fucked up.
01:50:15 You don't own the means of production.
01:50:16 Yeah, I know, production.
01:50:18 Yeah, you've been you've been hamstrung.
01:50:22 Scalpers is what globalism is bad.
01:50:25 It's time to next voicemail.
01:50:27 Yeah, let's let's go on.
01:50:29 Next voicemail is Error Array and Bear Investment Classroom.
01:50:34 Help. He can't count three, two, one, go.
01:50:43 He's nice.
01:50:45 Spare the bear.
01:50:57 Making investments in teacher callers.
01:51:01 The bear needs more than just table manners.
01:51:05 How can I teach him about investment?
01:51:12 Why is this a song?
01:51:14 Well, it's just how they speak.
01:51:17 Yeah. Why would you be asking us for how to learn about this episode?
01:51:23 This episode is proved definitively.
01:51:25 We are not the people to talk about this with.
01:51:27 I've just do the opposite of what we say.
01:51:31 Lost hundreds of thousands of dollars every second.
01:51:35 I'm like the I'm like the reverse Jeff Bezos.
01:51:37 I lose ten million dollars a second by not having been part of the original Bitcoin people.
01:51:46 Yeah, exactly.
01:51:50 Oh, I like that.
01:51:51 I think that's a funny that's funny.
01:51:54 I like it. I'm very proud of myself.
01:51:56 Good job.
01:51:58 Thanks.
01:52:00 Next voicemail is from Keyblade Spirit.
01:52:04 Well, I like that he invested in t-shirt callers, not in t-shirts,
01:52:09 specifically in t-shirt callers.
01:52:11 That's called Division of Work.
01:52:13 That's called Division of Labor.
01:52:14 That's a post industrial society.
01:52:16 That's called technology.
01:52:19 Next one is Keyblade Spirit.
01:52:21 Three, two, one, go.
01:52:24 Hey, PCP, here's how to truly enjoy Mindsweeper.
01:52:26 But first, a brief history lesson.
01:52:28 Oh, you see, Mindsweeper and all the other default games that came with Windows, whatever.
01:52:38 Those were designed specifically to teach people how to use the mouse.
01:52:45 And this is crucial because in order to enjoy Mindsweeper in the form that it was originally intended,
01:52:52 you just have to completely forget every single thing you know about using a mouse.
01:52:59 And that will make it a perfect 100% keynote experience.
01:53:04 I know this because this is how I learned how to use a mouse in Microsoft Windows back in the day
01:53:10 when I was a toddler.
01:53:13 I don't.
01:53:13 Good night.
01:53:15 Okay, I do not follow the logic of why do you why do you need to forget everything about
01:53:22 how does that improve the Mindsweeper experience?
01:53:25 Is it because the wonder of being able to affect things on screen with a mouse,
01:53:29 that's where the true joy of Mindsweeper comes from?
01:53:32 Is that what's being applied here?
01:53:35 I can't unlearn it.
01:53:38 My mouse is a wireless Bluetooth mouse.
01:53:40 I need to go get a ball mouse from 1995 in order to truly enjoy Mindsweeper as intended by this logic.
01:53:47 The tactility of the little rubber ball moving the X and Y values
01:53:51 is the only way to play Mindsweeper properly with original hardware,
01:53:54 this emulation with Bluetooth technology, you're just not cutting it.
01:53:58 I must acknowledge that I made a complete fool of myself last week in talking.
01:54:05 There were comments addressing this and Gib, you explained it to me as well,
01:54:11 that you can in fact deduce a lot more about Mind Locations than I was seeing at the time.
01:54:22 Obviously, I am terrible at Mindsweeper.
01:54:27 But now I get it, if you're like cross-referencing multiple squares with numbers,
01:54:32 you can give it, oh, if this one's got two next to it,
01:54:35 but that one's only got one next to it and it can't be either of these,
01:54:39 this must be a safe square and the mind must be here, if these both are next to one.
01:54:47 I just wasn't thinking.
01:54:48 You just thought it was too much like a real Mindsweeper, in real life with a mind detector.
01:54:54 Where you just go willy-nilly and just jump wherever you are looking.
01:55:00 Yeah, they get all that expensive equipment, they just like long jump into the thing, see what happens.
01:55:05 I think it's just because I played Mindsweeper since I was a little baby,
01:55:10 and I just thought it was like a baby game, and I didn't think about how like, no,
01:55:15 it actually is kind of like a puzzle, sort of like PyCross,
01:55:18 where you sort of like logic it out.
01:55:19 I just have never approached it that way, and I've seen it for so long.
01:55:25 It was a different way of conceiving of the game.
01:55:29 You know, briefly, mentioning like the Windows, like the game package with Windows,
01:55:35 to teach people about the mouse, I remembered the joy of turning on the mouse trails,
01:55:41 so that when you move the mouse, like a after image of your cursor is left,
01:55:46 and I found the settings in Windows 10, so now I can just, I have thing now.
01:55:50 I remember.
01:55:51 Why would you want to do that?
01:55:53 Because I remember it, I remember like moving it one pixel at a time,
01:55:56 and you can like make it look cool, like it's 3D, or like a mouse-shaped prism.
01:56:04 Ooh.
01:56:05 I'm making swirly's right now.
01:56:08 Wow, that's amazing.
01:56:12 Fuck Mindsweeper, fuck playing Mindsweeper during the podcast.
01:56:15 I'm just gonna make mouse swirly's.
01:56:17 Just make mouse swirly's.
01:56:20 Is better.
01:56:21 Uh, next voicemail is called Max L Clutch.
01:56:26 Three, two, one, go.
01:56:30 Hey PCP, it's time to shift these voicemails up a gear, with me.
01:56:34 Max Clutch!
01:56:36 Oh my god.
01:56:38 It sounds like he's actually-
01:56:39 All right, give me your fastest speeds in the car, each of you.
01:56:42 Adam up, divided by three, that's the speed I'm going on my next voicemail.
01:56:47 Wait, your fastest speed in a car?
01:56:52 No, he says give me numbers, and then I'll calculate them,
01:56:56 and that's the speed I will go in my next voicemail.
01:56:59 I don't want you to die though.
01:57:02 Oh, I kind of want him to die though.
01:57:05 Wait.
01:57:09 He said, yeah, give me your fastest speeds in the car, each of you.
01:57:13 I don't know what the fastest speed I've gone in a car.
01:57:17 I mean, I've definitely done over a hundred.
01:57:20 I might have done-
01:57:23 I feel like I might have done 120 one time.
01:57:27 Is that a thing you can do in a car?
01:57:28 I don't-
01:57:29 Yeah, in some cars.
01:57:31 I've gone on a motorway.
01:57:32 What is a motorway?
01:57:34 I've definitely done at least 90.
01:57:36 I think I've gone up to 110 at one point, but never more than that.
01:57:39 I've definitely gone over a hundred.
01:57:41 I'm not sure if I've ever actually done 120.
01:57:44 Maybe.
01:57:44 If we've all done a hundred, this guy's pushing a hundred next voicemail.
01:57:48 There was a-
01:57:51 I drove from Idlewild, California to Las Vegas and back one time,
01:57:58 and that is a bunch of long, featureless roads through the fucking desert.
01:58:03 And I did it in just a fucking sedan, and I shit you not.
01:58:08 There was-
01:58:10 I literally raced a guy on the highway.
01:58:14 My car was not cut out for it, but there was another guy in-
01:58:18 I don't know what model it was, but it was a red-
01:58:20 It was a sports car, and he was passing people.
01:58:27 He was ducking and weaving, and I just did it.
01:58:31 And I followed him, and we just kind of stayed neck and neck.
01:58:35 We kind of stayed neck and neck with each other,
01:58:38 and just kept passing people together.
01:58:41 And I think I eventually just let him go, because I didn't want to keep doing this.
01:58:49 But I did that one time, and I went really, really fast.
01:58:55 Pretty zoomy, I hope you-
01:58:59 Next voicemail is called-
01:59:00 Wait, I just want to say 17.
01:59:02 I've been- I haven't driven a lot, but I have taken some lessons,
01:59:06 and I went on a motorway once, and it says,
01:59:09 Do the motorway, 70 miles per hour.
01:59:12 Okay, I said, tears running down my face, expecting to die every any second.
01:59:17 So that's my number.
01:59:19 Cool.
01:59:19 Do you not drive?
01:59:21 I don't, no.
01:59:22 There's no reason to where I live.
01:59:24 I mean, I don't really eat anymore.
01:59:26 I used to, because I used to live in places that required it more.
01:59:30 God, I'm jealous of your ability to not need a car.
01:59:34 I hate driving, it's the worst.
01:59:37 That, well, that's why I wanted to live in the greater Boston area,
01:59:44 which was great until COVID, and then I don't want to take any transportation,
01:59:48 any public transit.
01:59:49 I just had to pay my excise tax, and every time I have to pay my excise tax,
01:59:54 I see the with rage.
01:59:56 What is an excise tax?
01:59:58 An excise tax is a Massachusetts only tax,
02:00:01 where they tax your vehicle for using the roads, and we're the only state that has it.
02:00:07 So it's a tax on your car, basically just for having a car.
02:00:11 Correct.
02:00:12 Okay.
02:00:13 And it's really, it's not expensive, mine was like $50, but it's just like,
02:00:18 it's the principle of the matter, that like every year I have to pay an additional tax,
02:00:23 just for having the fucking car, and where the only stateship does it,
02:00:28 yeah, yeah.
02:00:29 And it's just like, fuck you.
02:00:33 Yeah, like auto insurance, and like all the associated,
02:00:39 even if you don't use the car, it costs you money, plus it's expensive just to buy one.
02:00:44 The problem is if you don't use the car, the car will break down, and then it's dead.
02:00:47 So like, it's a liability any way you cut it.
02:00:51 I hate it, I hate car ownership, and I'm glad that I don't do it.
02:00:56 Uh, well, although sometimes I do,
02:00:59 sometimes I think about maybe getting a Vespa or something one day, I don't know.
02:01:04 I could do that, I could get a Vespa.
02:01:08 It's tempting.
02:01:10 Might be funny, might be funny.
02:01:11 Finally live out your FLCL fantasies, all those years ago.
02:01:15 You know, you know, the thing about it though, is that
02:01:20 Haruka rides the Vespa like you would ride a motorcycle, like she does it cool.
02:01:26 But like a real, like that's sort of, I didn't really think about it at the time,
02:01:29 because I had never really seen a Vespa in real life.
02:01:32 But sort of the joke of that, is that an actual Vespa is not cool, and like doesn't
02:01:37 fucking do anything, which, yeah.
02:01:40 An anime Vespa, in all sense of the word.
02:01:44 You should never, never the less, I mean,
02:01:47 never the less the idea of like a small motorized vehicle still has its appeal,
02:01:52 even if it's fucking dweeby and doesn't go fast or anything.
02:01:56 Like still, maybe.
02:01:59 I'd think about it.
02:02:00 Moped's can be cool, in a cringe kind of way.
02:02:06 Night based.
02:02:09 A next voicemail is Cross, literally my first acapella, but I think it's okay.
02:02:15 Three, two, one, go.
02:02:17 I'm supposed to be working right now.
02:02:25 I'm supposed to be working right now.
02:02:30 But I'm not working, I'm doing nothing.
02:02:35 My dick, I'm jerking, myself, I'm suiting.
02:02:40 I am an asshole, I am a stupid bomb.
02:02:46 I got a deadline, don't want to do it.
02:02:54 That was pretty good.
02:02:55 Yeah, that should be the theme song for this episode.
02:02:58 I agree, I was gonna say the same thing.
02:03:01 Eleazar, make it happen, make it work.
02:03:07 Cut it, crop it, chop it, and send it to the press.
02:03:11 Next voicemail is called, hey, a couple of questions.
02:03:15 Three, two, one, go.
02:03:22 You guys like macaroni salad?
02:03:24 Yeah.
02:03:25 No.
02:03:26 I don't know what that is.
02:03:27 No?
02:03:28 Shit, just dropped some on my floor.
02:03:32 Fuck.
02:03:32 Only one question so far, genius.
02:03:35 You know, isn't Speakpipe supposed to be like charging you money?
02:03:38 You just never did.
02:03:40 I don't know.
02:03:40 That is correct, and that is technically a couple of questions.
02:03:44 Okay.
02:03:44 We do know that, yes, it's funny.
02:03:47 I'm shocked that you, Tom, don't like macaroni salad,
02:03:51 and that you, Gib, don't know what it is.
02:03:53 I know what macaroni is, I think.
02:03:54 It's like a little pasta shape.
02:03:56 Okay, if you told me that you didn't know what macaroni was, I would freak out.
02:04:02 I think I've had macaroni before.
02:04:04 What do you mean you think you've had macaroni before?
02:04:09 Well, I mean, I've had pasta before, I don't know.
02:04:12 I think, like, think back to it.
02:04:14 Wait, pause.
02:04:16 What?
02:04:18 What is happening?
02:04:20 How do you not know what macaroni and cheese is?
02:04:22 Is that like an American thing?
02:04:24 That's impossible.
02:04:25 That's impossible.
02:04:26 It might be an American thing.
02:04:27 I've never heard of it growing up until-
02:04:30 What?
02:04:32 Okay, Radcon 5 mac and cheese.
02:04:35 I don't like cheese.
02:04:36 That's unbelievable.
02:04:39 I'm just trying to think of like times where I,
02:04:41 like I know it's like small tiny little bits of pasta as opposed to like-
02:04:46 No, literally having a mental breakdown right now.
02:04:50 What is so strange about this?
02:04:51 It's like saying the sky's blue, I never knew.
02:04:54 That's literally, that's like, you know, bread?
02:04:56 I think I tried that one time and it was like, it was decent.
02:05:01 No, that would be like saying, I've heard of pasta, like as a whole food group.
02:05:06 Okay, yes.
02:05:07 Macaroni is a food group in America, let's be real.
02:05:10 I mean, okay.
02:05:12 It called it macaroni.
02:05:13 That was the first time I heard the word, but I didn't know what it was.
02:05:16 I mean, macaroni and cheese, other than like spaghetti, is like the most common pasta dish.
02:05:24 Spaghetti is the most, yeah, that's, that's like, if I said, I think I've had spaghetti, like-
02:05:31 No, no, no, it's the same.
02:05:32 That's, that is what you're saying.
02:05:34 I guess I can understand if that's-
02:05:35 That's literally on the level, that's literally on the level of what this feels like to me.
02:05:40 Not over here.
02:05:41 Okay, yeah, macaroni and cheese is like a, is like a staple over here.
02:05:47 I mean, it explains a lot.
02:05:48 It's very American, high in fat, high in carbs, not good for you at all.
02:05:52 When I think of like default pasta, I think of spaghetti and then I think of frisilli,
02:05:57 which is like the twists.
02:06:00 Those are like the number one and number two normal pasta things.
02:06:04 I mean, yeah, I mean, macaroni is probably not the most common pasta that I eat.
02:06:12 It's just, it's just such a staple of the, because it's macaroni and cheese.
02:06:14 According to Wikipedia, it's called macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom.
02:06:18 So it exists where you are.
02:06:20 Well, they cut out, they cut out the and, oh, they're too good for the and, okay.
02:06:25 I mean, I mean-
02:06:26 Wait, no, I haven't had these little, these little tiny tubes.
02:06:28 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:06:29 But I don't think, I haven't had macaroni and cheese because I just, I don't like cheese.
02:06:33 Practically speaking, macaroni and cheese, I mean, well, technically it's, you know,
02:06:38 traditionally made with macaroni.
02:06:39 I mean, if you made mac and cheese with fusilli, you'd still call it macaroni and cheese, probably.
02:06:45 Yeah, cool.
02:06:46 Kind of like how you still call it Jell-O, even if it's something else,
02:06:49 even if it's some other brand, or you still call it,
02:06:55 they still call it Coke, right?
02:06:57 Like in the South, is that where they call it Coke?
02:07:00 They call it every soda Coke?
02:07:01 Yeah, some places.
02:07:01 Some places they call every soda Coke.
02:07:03 Um, what was the other-
02:07:05 I mean, macaroni salad is like, it's cold, it's like cooked macaroni, but it's cold,
02:07:10 and it's usually got like a mayonnaise-based kind of sauce with like herbs maybe in it,
02:07:16 and like vegetables.
02:07:17 Yeah, I'm not a mayonnaise fan in general, so.
02:07:19 I, I like, I like mayonnaise, so.
02:07:22 You know, it's like a, you know, it's like a barbecue staple, you know, like you go to a
02:07:26 barbecue and you got like, you know, your dogs and your burgers and maybe like your ribs and
02:07:30 your sausages, and then you got your side dishes, and you maybe got like your potato salad,
02:07:34 and your macaroni salad.
02:07:35 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:07:36 Oh, I love, I love potato salad.
02:07:38 It's, it's usually not macaroni, but I, I think I've had salads like that at barbecue and things.
02:07:43 Yeah, it's, it's, it's okay, I can't do the mayo, just not a huge fan.
02:07:48 I made a, I made a BLT the other day.
02:07:49 It sucks, it's keto, it's good keto food.
02:07:52 It is, I made a, I made a BLT on some keto bread the other day, and it was, uh, it was, uh,
02:07:58 have you, have you found keto bread?
02:08:00 Have you been, or have you looked for any?
02:08:01 I've seen a couple, but they all have like still a lot of carbs, even net carbs.
02:08:06 It's like over 10.
02:08:07 I'm just like, no, die.
02:08:09 And that's for one piece of bread.
02:08:10 I'm like, that's my entire day's carbs in one sandwich, not worth it.
02:08:13 If you can find, if you can find love and fresh, love and fresh is like all wheat,
02:08:17 like wheat starch, it's all, it's all fiber, like it's all fiber.
02:08:21 Okay.
02:08:22 And it's good.
02:08:22 If you can find it anywhere.
02:08:24 Where do you get it?
02:08:25 Aldi.
02:08:26 Oh, wow.
02:08:27 Didn't you say that like they just closed the Aldi near you?
02:08:29 They don't, they don't deliver it.
02:08:31 They, yeah, they'd close it temporarily to remodel and then they don't deliver it anymore.
02:08:34 But I go there and like their selection has shrinked significantly in the last like couple
02:08:40 of weeks, which really sucks.
02:08:42 I feel like I've said this before, but I'm shocked.
02:08:45 I'm shocked that they have it at my Aldi.
02:08:48 Cause when I think of Aldi, I think like kind of a crap selection, uh, place.
02:08:54 And yet they have these like very specific like specialty breads
02:08:57 that I can't find anywhere else.
02:08:59 So it's really just the best of both worlds.
02:09:01 Yeah.
02:09:02 It's, it's cheap and exactly what you need.
02:09:04 Cheap and niche is not usually something that goes together.
02:09:06 Spag ball, spag, spag ball is, is what people call it.
02:09:11 Whoa.
02:09:11 Spag, spag ball.
02:09:13 I never called it that.
02:09:15 What is it?
02:09:16 What is it?
02:09:17 Spaghetti bolognese is like the colloquial term for that.
02:09:21 Oh, spag ball.
02:09:23 Wait, spag.
02:09:26 Okay.
02:09:26 Spaghetti bolognese, bolognese is like a tomato meat sauce, right?
02:09:30 Yeah.
02:09:30 That, that's what I think of like is maybe the equivalent of mac and cheese.
02:09:35 Like in terms of like ubiquitousness among English families.
02:09:40 This is weird.
02:09:41 I mean, we have, like we have spaghetti bolognese, but I mean most we, I mean,
02:09:47 spaghetti and meatballs would be more classic.
02:09:50 Yeah, maybe that fair.
02:09:52 Yeah.
02:09:53 I mean, I would, yeah.
02:09:55 I've never heard anyone call it spag ball, but I guess it's.
02:09:58 It was a few people at school called it that.
02:10:00 I was like, wait, people, that sounds gross.
02:10:03 Why would you call it that?
02:10:04 It does sound gross.
02:10:06 But it does sound gross, but I like it.
02:10:08 I, um, I like a good spag ball.
02:10:12 Um, I don't, uh, yeah, it's good.
02:10:17 It's probably not something I would like make.
02:10:19 I mean, not, I mean, I'm keto now.
02:10:20 So, uh, I've never been much of like a spaghetti guy.
02:10:24 It's fine.
02:10:25 It's okay.
02:10:27 I'll take it.
02:10:28 Um, next one.
02:10:30 Yep.
02:10:31 Yeah, suit up.
02:10:31 Okay.
02:10:32 Next one is called mentally challenging game.
02:10:34 Three, two, one, go.
02:10:38 So Gibbs said she wanted a game that can mentally challenge her.
02:10:42 Yes.
02:10:43 You know, look no further than Phoenix rights trilogy.
02:10:46 It's just been released on the PlayStation five and switch and PC.
02:10:50 Or you can just emulate the original Game Boy or DS games.
02:10:54 They are fantastic.
02:10:55 I, I don't know if I talked about this on the PCP,
02:10:58 but I had recently booted up my old DS and replayed the original trilogy just for,
02:11:04 because it was, I felt like it, and it was great.
02:11:07 It was so good.
02:11:09 I did.
02:11:09 I think this guy's, this guy's recommending games and his
02:11:13 and his recommendation is just, oh, games on the Game Boy.
02:11:18 Like no, that's not specific enough.
02:11:22 Say Phoenix, right?
02:11:24 I guess he did say Phoenix, right?
02:11:26 But series.
02:11:27 I mean, it's on Game Boy and DS.
02:11:29 So like, but Gibbs already played all those.
02:11:31 She's like, she's talked, she's talked about it many times and she's a big fan of that series.
02:11:36 Yeah.
02:11:36 I guess, right?
02:11:36 I guess he just didn't know.
02:11:38 Maybe he didn't know.
02:11:39 Um, I mean, I don't know if you've played it,
02:11:42 but like a game that I remember being like kind of like thinky and heady,
02:11:45 even though I haven't played it in a while.
02:11:47 I played it after Phoenix, right?
02:11:48 It was Hotel Dusk Room 215 for the DS.
02:11:51 Oh, is that the guy with the meme face where he's like smiling and he's like, yeah.
02:11:56 I have no idea.
02:11:57 It's like, it's like a, you hold the DS sideways and you go through like a 3D rendered hotel,
02:12:01 but all the characters are drawn in like pencil sketch looking things.
02:12:04 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:12:04 Hotel Dusk meme face.
02:12:07 What's the one?
02:12:09 Nate used it in one of the Smash reveal videos.
02:12:12 I can't find it, but it's fun though.
02:12:15 It's a good game.
02:12:16 Yeah, I think I have that.
02:12:17 I don't remember beating it though.
02:12:19 So I could, I could boot that up.
02:12:20 It's this guy.
02:12:23 It's not that.
02:12:23 That's not the face that is the meme face.
02:12:26 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:12:26 That's the guy though.
02:12:28 Oh, there it is.
02:12:28 It was a fun game.
02:12:29 That's it.
02:12:30 That's my recommendation.
02:12:32 That's the one.
02:12:33 There it is.
02:12:34 He's so satisfied with whatever that is.
02:12:38 Someday I hope to feel satisfaction to that level.
02:12:41 Oh my God, I just got a fucking, this sucks.
02:12:45 I just got a fucking notification that I guess there's,
02:12:49 I have a family Zoom meeting at 5.30.
02:12:52 What does that mean?
02:12:54 What the fuck?
02:12:55 I mean, I'm glad we're almost done.
02:12:56 I guess, I had no idea, but I guess I'm supposed to have a family conference call
02:13:02 with my family in eight minutes.
02:13:06 They really need to sit down and talk to Nate
02:13:08 about this league of Nate fuckers.
02:13:09 It's just, it's getting a little out of hand and they're concerned.
02:13:12 No, they've joined the league.
02:13:15 Okay, I'm going to tell them that I'll be there soon.
02:13:19 If I'm a little late, it's fine.
02:13:23 Sorry, I got a little distracted there.
02:13:26 Next voicemail?
02:13:26 Yep.
02:13:27 Yeah.
02:13:28 Okay.
02:13:28 It's called Love the New Segment 321 Go.
02:13:32 Hey, it's that part of the podcast
02:13:34 where Oblivion followed those funny voices.
02:13:36 Yeah.
02:13:41 Smeagol must have been Oblivion's fall, right?
02:13:46 There's no way to know.
02:13:47 Who's Smeagol?
02:13:48 I mean, like in this, in a voicemail.
02:13:51 I mean, no, Smeagol, Smeagol.
02:13:52 Smeagol.
02:13:53 Oh, yeah.
02:13:54 Yeah.
02:13:56 No, actually no.
02:13:58 That was Smeagol from Lord of the Rings.
02:14:00 It was just Smeagol, yes.
02:14:03 Yeah.
02:14:04 I mean, it is a good new segment.
02:14:05 I enjoy Smeagol.
02:14:10 What?
02:14:11 I don't know, what is this?
02:14:12 Is this a joke?
02:14:12 Like, yes, I ironically do love the new segment.
02:14:14 Fuck you.
02:14:15 This guy thinks he's too fucking cool for school.
02:14:18 Yeah, yeah.
02:14:20 Next voicemail is The Lord of North Fearwell 321 Go.
02:14:32 The Lord of North Fearwell, it has come to our attention,
02:14:39 that I'd like to say, does the Dark Lord have to play mine, Smeagol?
02:14:45 I know.
02:14:46 I think this guy chooses his way in the game,
02:14:51 instead of improving his skills.
02:14:55 This guy, this like the lot of girls suck.
02:14:58 If it was a day, so early on the walking day,
02:15:04 and the Lord of North Fearwell 321 Go.
02:15:07 Shut up.
02:15:08 Who fucking cares about mine, Smeagol?
02:15:11 Apparently, it's a big deal.
02:15:13 I don't give a fuck.
02:15:16 It's a baby game for idiots.
02:15:21 Stop.
02:15:22 Stop.
02:15:22 No.
02:15:24 No!
02:15:25 No!
02:15:27 We are the Lord of North Fearwell 321 Go.
02:15:29 I'm so scared.
02:15:32 I hate you.
02:15:36 Is this a little too thick on the effects now?
02:15:40 I could not understand most of it,
02:15:43 but like the point came across loud and clear.
02:15:47 It's like if a Dalek was at the bottom of a well.
02:15:50 He's so upset that I didn't play minesweeper, right?
02:15:55 He's just like incoherent with rage.
02:15:58 Really?
02:15:58 You really stuck a nerve with the minesweeper community.
02:16:01 I did.
02:16:02 I did.
02:16:02 I triggered them, you might say.
02:16:04 I trolled them epically.
02:16:06 I was only pretending to be an idiot,
02:16:09 and you are the fool for being upset about it.
02:16:13 Next voicemail is called TheMainAlien at MoonAnion.com.
02:16:21 It's called AmoonAnion 321 Go.
02:16:30 Oh, Christ.
02:16:31 MoonAnion, mainly AmoonAnion.
02:16:38 I can't hear them.
02:16:40 No, you know what?
02:16:42 You know what?
02:16:44 MoonAnions are the most numerous of the aliens.
02:16:52 You could even say that mainly MoonAnions are the main aliens.
02:17:07 Look at what we've cultivated.
02:17:11 Oh, my God, why?
02:17:12 I'm going to brownmate in his butthole.
02:17:19 Night, night, boy, pussy, night, boy, pussy, oh, wow, yeah, boy, pussy, boy, pussy.
02:17:31 Oh, my God.
02:17:37 You know what?
02:17:37 Oh, my God, there's so many of them.
02:17:38 They really are the main aliens.
02:17:42 You know what?
02:17:43 That Love the New Segment guy, he was prophetic.
02:17:47 He knew exactly what he was talking about.
02:17:51 He had it exactly right.
02:17:52 The New Segment sucks, and I hate it.
02:17:55 Thanks.
02:17:56 I like the reference to the MoonAnions.
02:17:59 It's a Gib reference, a very ancient Gib reference.
02:18:04 Wait, is it?
02:18:05 Yeah, mainly MoonAnions are the main aliens.
02:18:08 It's from a video where me and my brother were in the park late at night hunting ghosts.
02:18:17 Ghosts?
02:18:18 Ghosts.
02:18:18 We're ghosts watchers, and we were in the park, and we found evidence of alien life forms,
02:18:26 the MoonAnions.
02:18:29 Yes.
02:18:30 Nice.
02:18:31 That's good.
02:18:31 Okay, you know what?
02:18:32 That does ring a bell, actually, vaguely.
02:18:35 Um, well, thanks for the fucking voicemail.
02:18:38 I liked it.
02:18:39 Next one, wait.
02:18:41 Yeah, it had its charms.
02:18:45 Next voicemail is called Bward Co-op number three, and this time I remember it's Ben,
02:18:50 weekly reminder to catch up on One Piece number three.
02:18:54 Three, two, one, go.
02:18:56 Ben, Ben, Ben.
02:18:58 Here we are once again.
02:18:59 I'm disappointed in you.
02:19:02 Once again, it's Ben.
02:19:04 You can weekly reminder to catch up on One Piece.
02:19:06 How do you know?
02:19:06 Maybe I caught up on One Piece.
02:19:07 It's very good, and should only take a few days.
02:19:10 Thank you, bye.
02:19:11 A few days.
02:19:13 A few days.
02:19:13 Very presumptuous of him to assume that I haven't caught up on One Piece yet.
02:19:17 Are you presumed too much about Ben's reading level?
02:19:19 No.
02:19:19 Take him a lot longer than that.
02:19:22 I am very stupid.
02:19:29 I'll get around to it.

02:19:34 It's good.
