00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:05 I am the best guy ever, which is a temporal designation, cause cool things used to happen, but I've always been the best.
00:00:15 Oh, I longed for those days when I was the best, which is also now. Also, Hippocrit is here.
00:00:21 I forgot how it went. The bad leg, that's why you're sitting there, I kicked your leg out.
00:00:28 Fuck you. You ruined it, Davoo. You ruined everything by fucking up your audio.
00:00:32 It's a good intro and it's gone now. It's gone forever.
00:00:35 Jesse's here, Endless Jess.
00:00:37 I am the mighty toer, a hinga-dinga-derigan. I love the Swedish meatballs.
00:00:45 Tommy Oliver. What's up, dude?
00:00:48 I got to recover my formula to defeat the Jews. It was there and now it's gone.
00:00:53 Oh god, without context, it just sounds like you're an anti-Semite.
00:00:57 Oh no. I mean, he is.
00:01:00 And our mutual mortal enemy, Davoo. Thank you for joining us.
00:01:06 So we're all feeling very nostalgic today. That was the topic of the episode.
00:01:11 We recorded an intro, you guys. It was a glorious intro, but it died. It was deleted.
00:01:17 It's in the sands of history at the sands of time now.
00:01:20 The thing that's quite apt is that it wasn't even that good, but we all love it because it was in the past and it's gone forever.
00:01:26 Oh my god. That's so apropos. That's absolutely true. It was total shit.
00:01:31 Garbage. It was garbage.
00:01:33 But I love it. It's my intro.
00:01:38 Yes. Many shit intros, but that one was ours.
00:01:42 But anyway, let's just, we're going to talk about nostalgia. What's the fucking deal with it?
00:01:48 And luckily, we have the world's foremost expert on nostalgia, Hippocrite, here with us to tell us everything we need to know.
00:01:55 The nostalgia critic's here?
00:01:57 Oh no. God, please.
00:01:59 He critiqued my video. That's what he did. That's all he's known for.
00:02:04 Wow. That epic review of one video made by Hippocrite.
00:02:10 Hippo, what is nostalgia? What is it?
00:02:15 It is. I love for a simpler time, usually an earlier time.
00:02:21 I mean, it's probably an earlier because you can't have nostalgia for the future.
00:02:26 But the point is, it's a time before, and you really wish you could go back.
00:02:33 And things from that time are sort of, they make you feel good just by reminding you of that time.
00:02:40 And that's generally, I think, what it is.
00:02:43 Hey, you know, I looked up the definition on Urban Dictionary, and the description is boring, but there's something interesting here.
00:02:49 So the top definition of nostalgia on Urban Dictionary just says,
00:02:53 And also, the condition of being homesick, homesickness, and there's no examples.
00:02:59 So this is one they didn't really give a shit about.
00:03:02 But underneath it, it just says photos and videos, and there's just one picture there, and it is a PlayStation 1.
00:03:08 And I'm like, yeah, dude, yeah, that is so fucking apt.
00:03:14 You know what, speaking of PlayStation 1, the thing that always gets me, that like hits that nostalgia bone,
00:03:19 is when you actually plug in the PlayStation 1 and press power, and you get that BOOM!
00:03:26 Yeah!
00:03:28 That's the best.
00:03:29 I don't get why consoles don't do that shit anymore.
00:03:32 When did they give up?
00:03:33 Like, did they give up after Gamecube, which was the best one?
00:03:36 Like, I just thought, okay, we're done now.
00:03:38 I don't know, that PS1 sound was like the coolest sound of all time.
00:03:42 And then it started the game, and then it had like a sequel like Little China.
00:03:47 Yeah, there were two of them on the PS1.
00:03:49 I'm so fucking ready!
00:03:51 And then the game was never as good as that sound.
00:03:54 And like, even like when you would play like PS1 games on like the PS3 when it was backwards compatible,
00:03:59 it would have the second one, it would have the second one of like the logo, but it didn't have the BOOM!
00:04:05 It didn't have that part.
00:04:06 Well, you know what? I've been playing like PS1 games on PS3 for so long.
00:04:10 I forgot that that was the first blang.
00:04:12 Yeah, it was the first blang!
00:04:16 You know, when I think of that sound, I always inevitably follow it up in my mind with, there's that
00:04:24 And then after the PlayStation 1 thing resolves, I just hear that
00:04:31 The Final Fantasy IX intro is what comes to my mind immediately.
00:04:34 That was the first PS1 game that I got super invested in, so yeah, I'm exactly the same.
00:04:39 Hey, you know, Final Fantasy VII would have taken it, but there is no like song that plays when you get to the title screen of Final Fantasy VII.
00:04:46 That's why it's the worst game.
00:04:48 I still have my original PlayStation, and I just like, not even plugging it in, just clicking the open the latch button,
00:04:55 and it goes kching with the spring sound.
00:04:58 And you love that shit.
00:04:59 And like the fucking Game Boy transitioning to the DS was the same problem where the Game Boy Advance was
00:05:03 Dwaaaang.
00:05:05 Yeah, yeah.
00:05:06 Then the DS was just dun-nun-nun-nun-nun.
00:05:08 Yeah, it was pretty shit.
00:05:09 What the fuck?
00:05:10 It was definitely less cool.
00:05:12 It was like way less cool.
00:05:14 What was interesting was that the Game Boy Advance, like visual that a Component had more like visual complexity than the DS one.
00:05:21 The DS one just kind of faded in, but like the Game Boy was like, look, we could do 3D-esque things now.
00:05:25 Isn't this cool?
00:05:26 I wonder why they stopped doing that.
00:05:28 I know why.
00:05:29 I'll tell you why.
00:05:30 I'll tell you why.
00:05:31 It's fucking big government.
00:05:32 That's what this problem is.
00:05:34 Big government coming in here.
00:05:36 Fucking crippling our beautiful game intros.
00:05:38 You know what's funny is that I was actually questioning it myself, and I was actually thinking of a not ironic answer
00:05:41 that was kind of similar along the same lines.
00:05:43 Oh yeah?
00:05:44 If you want to hear my logic, but that's not really the topic of today, so.
00:05:46 I was thinking it's my aesthetic sensibilities have changed.
00:05:49 Well, I think it might be more to do with the fact that they're also making like huge menus
00:05:56 for consoles instead of just like, you know.
00:06:00 Yeah.
00:06:01 Honestly, I was honestly like unironically thinking it may have something to do with the Sherman Antitrust Act.
00:06:06 Wow.
00:06:07 What do they do?
00:06:08 What's your, what's the connection there?
00:06:09 Well, because I was thinking about Microsoft, right?
00:06:11 Because like Windows 95 had all this personality.
00:06:13 You know, its intro was like Brian Eno.
00:06:15 How'd it go?
00:06:16 No, no, no, that's the fucking Game Boy one.
00:06:18 You know, dude, fuck, I can't even do it.
00:06:20 It's such a complex melody.
00:06:21 I can't even enunciate it.
00:06:22 It's pretty, I know the one.
00:06:24 In the 2000s, they just kind of gave up on that shit.
00:06:26 And I'm like, hmm, what changed about Microsoft in that time period?
00:06:30 Oh, well that would have been when Bill Gates was kicked out of the leading role,
00:06:33 and that's when the government cracked down on their supposed monopolies,
00:06:37 and they had to rearrange a bunch of shit.
00:06:39 So maybe the government said, don't have personality.
00:06:41 Don't lead people to think you have personality.
00:06:43 And then like all the other tech companies followed from Microsoft's example.
00:06:46 So yeah.
00:06:47 All I want to say to that taboo is correlation does not necessarily imply causation.
00:06:52 Well, it's the best theory I can come up with.
00:06:54 Well, I mean, Apple still has that chime that they've had since like the early 90s.
00:06:57 Well, they haven't like done anything with it for like 10 years, though.
00:07:00 Yeah, but they're a bunch of fucking millennial scum, Apple.
00:07:03 I wasn't trying to defend it.
00:07:05 I wasn't trying to defend it, but they haven't fucking...
00:07:06 The sound is boring.
00:07:07 I haven't fucking...
00:07:08 I haven't really liked Crash Bandicoot 3.
00:07:10 They still use the same goddamn phones and the same design.
00:07:12 You know, you jump around, you spin.
00:07:13 Who, Apple?
00:07:14 That's so cool.
00:07:15 You want to talk about nostalgia.
00:07:17 You know, first level of Crash Bandicoot 3, you get the wizard,
00:07:19 you hit him with your attack.
00:07:22 That's good.
00:07:23 My...
00:07:24 When we...
00:07:25 When we bought a PlayStation 1, I remember this day so well.
00:07:29 Now, this is a day I'm very nostalgic for.
00:07:31 We had had like a Super Nintendo and like a Game Boy and a couple little...
00:07:35 And an original Nintendo for a few years.
00:07:37 But we went, we...
00:07:38 Me and my brother pooled our money, bought ourselves a PlayStation 1.
00:07:42 My dad, out of the kindness of his heart, bought us a dedicated TV to use with it.
00:07:46 Whoa.
00:07:47 And the two games we brought home, this old-ass tube TV that's still in my house and works to this day,
00:07:52 and we bought ourselves Crash Bandicoot 1 and Final Fantasy 7,
00:07:56 were the two games that we brought home that day.
00:07:58 That is a solid story.
00:07:59 It was a magical...
00:08:00 It was a magical day.
00:08:01 I'll never forget it.
00:08:02 Writing in the car home with my family that I loved, that was great.
00:08:06 You know, what...
00:08:07 That reminds me of like a feeling I've had that I've missed,
00:08:10 is like the idea of just having a console and having just a couple games on it,
00:08:14 and just switching between them, because like you don't have real money.
00:08:18 Like you got...
00:08:19 Oh yeah, if I'm tired of playing Crash, then let's go for a fucking epic Final Fantasy sort of.
00:08:25 It forces you to like explore every nuance of what made the games good.
00:08:29 As opposed to now, you've got 20,000 Steam games, so you play them each for like two minutes,
00:08:34 and you don't really get the worst.
00:08:35 Yeah, what I was thinking is, because I've long felt that I don't have like nostalgic feelings,
00:08:39 but like lately I'm thinking something I definitely have nostalgic feelings for is video games,
00:08:45 but not video games in general, but like specific moments or aspects of very specific video games.
00:08:51 Because like I've been playing through Earthbound for the first time,
00:08:54 and there's so many moments where I'm like, oh sweet, that's cool.
00:08:58 That was like a fun little charming moment.
00:09:00 And then I think, man, if I had been playing this when I was nine,
00:09:03 which wouldn't have been possible, it wasn't localized.
00:09:05 If I'd been playing this like ten years ago.
00:09:08 Are you talking about Earthbound or Mother 3 or something?
00:09:10 No, Earthbound, yeah, yeah, Mother 2.
00:09:12 And like every single one of those moments would have been like amazing to me at the time,
00:09:16 because it would have taken me like so much longer to figure out, you know?
00:09:19 That's true, that's true.
00:09:21 That was a key of like having a lot of nostalgia for so many moments for Mario and Luigi Superstar Sack.
00:09:26 It was because I hadn't played any RPGs before, so I had no idea how to play them,
00:09:30 and I didn't know like where to look up to like get hints.
00:09:33 So like I would get stuck on certain moments for weeks,
00:09:36 just pouring over all the little details of everything,
00:09:39 and not having any other entertainment to go to.
00:09:42 So yeah, it was really like being stuck in this like void with nothing but you and this one thing,
00:09:47 and this one little problem you have to figure out.
00:09:49 And you spend so much time on it, you really get attached to it.
00:09:52 But now, now that I have gaming skills, they all just kind of come and go so quickly
00:09:56 that they don't leave as much impact.
00:09:58 I've got to cut in and just remind the people out there that yes,
00:10:03 I too have nostalgia for Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga.
00:10:06 That does not mean it is not also just objectively the greatest game ever made.
00:10:11 It is a really good game.
00:10:12 There is no amount of nostalgia will color the fact that it is the best game ever made,
00:10:18 and fuck you if you disagree.
00:10:20 Yeah, it's a really good game.
00:10:22 As Nate said earlier, like I'm an expert on nostalgia,
00:10:27 because only I think because I made a video called why nostalgia is a good thing.
00:10:32 I can't actually remember what I said, but I think what the point was,
00:10:36 was there's a difference between a nostalgic enjoyment of something
00:10:43 and an actual enjoyment in a way.
00:10:47 I think, actually, forget it.
00:10:49 I can't remember whether that was my point,
00:10:51 and I don't know whether I even agree with that video.
00:10:53 Well, we should all go watch that video again.
00:10:55 Everyone go to Hippocrates, like the first video on the channel.
00:10:58 Well, do go to Hippocrates.
00:10:59 No, do it. You have no choice. Go watch it.
00:11:01 But I was going to expand a little bit on what Jesse was saying before
00:11:04 about how I definitely agree that just the changing dynamics of the game's market,
00:11:11 having flooded, just flooded games like Duck Game and things like that
00:11:17 that are built to be like sort of like popcorn games,
00:11:20 like consumable party games that you don't really necessarily have to spend a lot of time with.
00:11:24 They're designed to be like let's played once, and that's right.
00:11:28 Like that's like their whole source of revenue,
00:11:30 is people watch goofy let's plays and buy them and never play them,
00:11:32 because they're garbage games.
00:11:34 I got way more out of Duck Game than I get out of most online multiplayer games.
00:11:39 I don't know about you.
00:11:40 Duck Game is pretty fun, but I don't really have any of the popcorn games out there
00:11:44 that are made just to be less played, like I Am Bread or something.
00:11:48 Like nobody actually cares about that game, but it was made for like one week.
00:11:52 I don't have to speak for...
00:11:53 I don't have to speak for...
00:11:54 Definitely that kind of game for sure.
00:11:55 Right. I can only speak for myself here, but I much...
00:11:58 I mean, okay, this is literally just me, and I don't know how many people this applies to,
00:12:02 but I way prefer like playing games alone, a single one-player experience,
00:12:07 getting absorbed in it.
00:12:08 I have been playing this last week or two near Automata,
00:12:12 and I near as a great series because it gives you the thing that I crave most out of a video game,
00:12:18 like it incentivizes you with in-game rewards to basically 100% it.
00:12:23 And that is the best thing that every game gives you, that a game could give me.
00:12:27 It encourages me to explore the breadth and the width of the content of the game,
00:12:32 both in terms of story, in terms of mechanics,
00:12:34 it forces you to figure out how to do stuff the optimal way.
00:12:38 It gets you to be invested in all the characters,
00:12:40 and found out all the little side stories that have been planted there.
00:12:43 So like, you know, this was something that was kind of forced on us.
00:12:46 Doesn't IM's breadth also force you to explore the breadth of the game?
00:12:51 Oh!
00:12:53 Well, it was just...
00:12:57 Back in the day, we were kind of...
00:13:00 Back in the day, you didn't really have to force players,
00:13:03 at least when we were kids at the very least,
00:13:05 you didn't have to give strong incentives for people to explore all of games,
00:13:09 because you would just do that because you had five games.
00:13:12 Of course, you're going to play them a thousand times and figure it out.
00:13:15 But in the current market, I really think it definitely pays,
00:13:18 and gives your game the kind of longevity and the good long runtime
00:13:23 to give, to structure it in such a way to encourage fully exploring it.
00:13:27 There's a number of times where I'll decide I'm going to just play a video game
00:13:31 and not do anything else for a day,
00:13:33 and not accomplish something by being able to focus that much.
00:13:36 And I'm like, wow, this is kind of sad that attention span is so scattershot
00:13:41 and tiny now because of social media and shit,
00:13:44 that I legitimately feel accomplished by playing a video game consistently.
00:13:48 Yeah, something that was not hard.
00:13:50 Like 100%ing a game, or like beating a game,
00:13:52 now like to me, just turning on a game and sitting down and playing it for 10 minutes
00:13:56 feels like something I worked for.
00:13:58 It feels like an accomplishment.
00:14:00 It's like a huge library of games that I haven't touched.
00:14:03 And it's weird because we're talking about nostalgia
00:14:06 and how we used to be way more invested in games back in the day.
00:14:08 And I think so much of it is just that, like we were saying,
00:14:10 because we don't have a lot of money and you only had a few options.
00:14:13 Because it's not even, I don't think so much that games are designed differently now.
00:14:17 I think it's just because I have disposable income.
00:14:20 Because I have like, right now I have 15 PS4 games,
00:14:24 50 PS3 games, and 70-something PS2 games
00:14:28 and I've played like maybe 10% of each of those.
00:14:30 And like, those are the games that like, they have depth.
00:14:33 They weren't designed for like, let's plays.
00:14:35 Like most of them predated let's plays.
00:14:37 But I just play them for like 10 minutes and I'm like,
00:14:39 oh, we're both the next one.
00:14:40 Or I just don't touch them at all and they just sort of shelf them.
00:14:42 It's impossible to not be nostalgic like just for video games as a whole as you get older
00:14:48 because you have no fucking time to play them anymore.
00:14:51 It feels like you have to force yourself to relax.
00:14:53 And like you said, they still make games that have a lot of depth,
00:14:57 that like reward a lot of investment.
00:14:59 I've had the last Guardian since November.
00:15:02 I haven't played it yet.
00:15:03 I have Breath of the Wild.
00:15:05 I haven't beaten it yet.
00:15:06 I'm only like a little bit into the game.
00:15:07 What do I do every time I turn on the fucking PS4?
00:15:10 I just play Binding of Isaac for an hour.
00:15:12 That's all I can fucking do every day.
00:15:13 It's the same game.
00:15:14 It's the same fucking thing every time.
00:15:16 It's just running around in room shooting shit.
00:15:18 But it's the only fucking thing I can invest in anymore
00:15:20 because fucking putting my brain into a Zelda game for 40 hours
00:15:25 seems more taxing to me than playing 40 different hour-long runs of the stupid Isaac game.
00:15:30 Yeah, I feel like a little bit of reason.
00:15:34 I hate you Binding of Isaac.
00:15:36 I hate you Florian.
00:15:37 You'll never be in Binding of Isaac.
00:15:38 Florian really.
00:15:39 It's all your fault.
00:15:41 I feel like a lot of the reason I do like a video game review show
00:15:48 is so that I can play games because there's a reason to do it.
00:15:52 Like Let's Plays, they take a lot of time,
00:15:55 which is why I turn to streaming now for like,
00:15:58 oh yeah, I want to play an old game,
00:16:00 but I can't be bothered because I got stuff to do.
00:16:03 And the games I'm like reviewing,
00:16:05 they're also games I have to play and I enjoy doing,
00:16:08 you know, recording them and playing them for stuff.
00:16:10 But the streaming is like, that's like, yeah,
00:16:13 I could sit down and play a game for a few hours
00:16:15 and it can be fun and it won't even be feeling like I'm an idiot.
00:16:19 And it's great.
00:16:21 You know what this kind of reminds me of?
00:16:24 It's just, I know I've said it before,
00:16:26 but even something like this podcast basically exists for the reason,
00:16:30 at least to me, for forcing us to be able to talk to each other
00:16:34 and do something together.
00:16:35 Like that's why I like to do it in order to get this game out of it.
00:16:39 I cannot motivate myself to do anything ever
00:16:41 if it is not feeding into some grand design goal
00:16:44 that will pay off in five years.
00:16:46 I think that is probably the big fucking mental change
00:16:49 that has happened with social media and stuff.
00:16:51 I feel like now that nothing I do or say has any sort of legitimacy
00:16:55 unless it's projected onto some social network so strangers can see it,
00:16:59 and it's really weird,
00:17:01 because I've just been doing a bunch of work for myself
00:17:03 the last couple of weeks in the beginning.
00:17:05 I was really jonesing on it,
00:17:06 and now I just feel like desperate for validation of what I've done.
00:17:09 It's just like a disgusting degeneracy of the mind,
00:17:13 being conditioned by like,
00:17:14 you have to have the clicks, you have to have the likes,
00:17:16 you have to have the views,
00:17:17 and it's just like, I can't just do shit anymore.
00:17:20 I think it's why I don't play video games or anything anymore,
00:17:22 because I have to stream it or I have to make a video about it,
00:17:24 or what's the fucking point?
00:17:25 Well, for me, I don't need attention.
00:17:27 I don't need people looking at it in the meantime.
00:17:29 It just has to be feeding towards something,
00:17:31 which I've been using game design as the excuse.
00:17:34 I'm like, well, I want to make a game with this, this, that, that,
00:17:37 and this mechanics in it.
00:17:38 But I want to make sure I've played all the important games
00:17:41 that have these mechanics in them,
00:17:43 so that I know I'm doing it right.
00:17:44 So I just wrote out a giant fucking list of all the games
00:17:47 I've been wanting to play my whole life,
00:17:49 and I'm like, I have to play them now.
00:17:51 So Earthbound was first on the list pretty much.
00:17:55 So for me, I'm having a great time.
00:17:58 I found the perfect excuse that's just an endless well
00:18:01 of perfectly, mentally, and emotional justification
00:18:04 to play all the stuff I've always wanted to play.
00:18:07 Well, that's good.
00:18:08 But it is sort of a similar motivation to what Tom was saying.
00:18:11 It is towards an end goal.
00:18:13 Well, I think, I don't know whether all of that
00:18:16 is necessarily like a downward sort of thing.
00:18:19 It used to be better when we were kids
00:18:21 and we would just do something for no reason.
00:18:23 I think it was where I didn't like it as much
00:18:25 as when I was a kid, because I felt like, even as a kid,
00:18:27 I was just sitting around trying to come up
00:18:29 with some sort of grand design for my life,
00:18:31 and I couldn't come up with anything at the time.
00:18:33 Well, yeah, I mean, what I'm saying is like nostalgia
00:18:36 is not necessarily inherently better than the current.
00:18:42 I think sometimes you look at the past
00:18:45 and you're sort of like rose-tinted goggles
00:18:48 or whatever you say.
00:18:49 Oh, I have no rose-tinted goggles for anything.
00:18:51 I think everything in my life is better now
00:18:53 than it was when I was younger.
00:18:54 Well, yeah.
00:18:55 Yeah, but things like this, like streaming,
00:18:57 I actually legitimately enjoy it a lot,
00:18:59 and I don't think it's too bad that I feel the need
00:19:02 to play a game on a live streaming platform
00:19:05 instead of by myself.
00:19:07 It's just fun.
00:19:08 It's like somebody's talking with me in the room,
00:19:11 like, yeah, I got friends over, kind of.
00:19:13 And it's kind of a replacement for, like,
00:19:16 because I don't actually have friends in real life.
00:19:19 Well, but...
00:19:20 Yeah, those are gay anyway.
00:19:22 It's...
00:19:23 You know, it's...
00:19:24 I don't know.
00:19:25 I think things are good.
00:19:27 War has changed, dude. War has changed.
00:19:29 The way that we conduct ourselves
00:19:31 is social media has changed the game forever,
00:19:35 and I don't know if we'll ever go back to the way it was.
00:19:38 I mean, there's a lot of...
00:19:40 Nier Automata is an oddly appropriate game
00:19:43 to have just played, because there's all this stuff
00:19:45 about how, like, all the robots,
00:19:47 and it's fucking robots doing shit,
00:19:49 like, they're all networked,
00:19:50 and they all kind of relate to each other
00:19:52 in different ways than a human-talking,
00:19:54 you know, person-to-person does,
00:19:56 and, like, you're able to...
00:19:58 You're able to kind of use your consciousness
00:20:01 through different bodies.
00:20:02 It's this whole complex thing,
00:20:03 but all I'm getting at is that
00:20:05 the way that we relate to each other
00:20:07 by having this electronic network of communication
00:20:10 as opposed to just verbal,
00:20:11 or, like, fucking smoke signals or whatever,
00:20:13 it's way different,
00:20:15 and it's only getting more different
00:20:17 and more different than, like, humanity was
00:20:19 at its inception,
00:20:20 and these are real fundamental changes
00:20:22 to us biologically in the way that we live in this world.
00:20:25 I think the way I see it is, like,
00:20:27 is that, like, you know,
00:20:29 hanging out with people in real life
00:20:31 with no fucking cameras anywhere, no recording.
00:20:33 That's still good.
00:20:34 You know, that's the classic.
00:20:35 It's been around forever.
00:20:36 You can still enjoy it,
00:20:38 but, you know,
00:20:39 talking to people,
00:20:40 having an extended Twitter rave about something
00:20:43 is also fun.
00:20:44 It's a new thing.
00:20:45 You know, one does not have to permanently
00:20:47 kick out the other,
00:20:48 and, you know,
00:20:49 sitting around playing a video game for 10 hours
00:20:51 is also a thing that you could do with your time.
00:20:53 I don't walk away from any one of these activities
00:20:56 feeling more or less satisfied than the others.
00:20:59 It's like, if I just play the video game for 10 hours,
00:21:01 I have this feeling in my mind of, like,
00:21:03 oh, God, I didn't do anything,
00:21:04 but play a video game for 10 hours.
00:21:06 But, like, if I just hang out with, like, friends all day,
00:21:09 I'll end it with the same feeling of,
00:21:11 wow, I didn't do anything,
00:21:12 but hang out with friends all day.
00:21:13 Like, it doesn't matter.
00:21:14 After I hang out with friends,
00:21:15 I feel like ending it too, my man.
00:21:17 I know what you mean.
00:21:18 It's just, like, there's just, there's just nothing.
00:21:20 In my opinion, there's nothing,
00:21:21 there's no one thing you can do with your time
00:21:24 that feels like the definitively perfect thing
00:21:26 to do with your time.
00:21:27 Everything you do is shutting...
00:21:29 Everything you do is closing the door
00:21:31 on everything else you could be doing with your time, you know?
00:21:34 So everything is a huge trade-off.
00:21:35 Everything lacks something.
00:21:37 So just don't worry about it.
00:21:39 It's my philosophy.
00:21:41 I've, uh...
00:21:42 Hmm.
00:21:43 I've heard the...
00:21:44 I don't know if I agree with that,
00:21:45 but I can respect it.
00:21:48 Hmm?
00:21:49 Because, like, I don't know.
00:21:50 I guess in my opinion,
00:21:51 I guess at the top of that up now.
00:21:52 That's the end of the PCP podcast.
00:21:53 It's over.
00:21:54 At last.
00:21:55 I don't know if I agree with that,
00:21:56 but I can respect it.
00:21:57 No more shows.
00:21:58 No more episodes.
00:21:59 All right.
00:22:00 We're done.
00:22:01 Well, I mean, I guess, I guess because me,
00:22:03 I just, like, my...
00:22:04 I just...
00:22:05 Working is always, like, the number one thing,
00:22:07 and if I'm not working on something,
00:22:09 like, if I'm not working on, like, an animation
00:22:11 or a drawing or a writing or something like that,
00:22:14 something productive,
00:22:15 like, there's always this creeping feeling in the back of my mind
00:22:17 that, like, you should be doing that.
00:22:19 So I'll play video...
00:22:20 Like, I used to play video games for hours and hours
00:22:22 and hours and hours.
00:22:23 Like, I wouldn't do homework in high school.
00:22:25 I would, like, lie and say,
00:22:26 I have no homework.
00:22:27 Like, for, like, two months now.
00:22:28 I just play video games,
00:22:29 like, until I have to go to bed.
00:22:30 Oh, well...
00:22:31 Oh, yeah.
00:22:32 Don't misinterpret.
00:22:33 There are lots and lots of things
00:22:34 I don't feel very happy doing.
00:22:36 I basically listed off three of the only ones.
00:22:38 Let's see.
00:22:39 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:40 Saying really interesting stuff on Twitter,
00:22:42 like, making a really interesting narrative
00:22:44 on social media that will always be great
00:22:46 to go back to.
00:22:47 I guess on Twitter,
00:22:48 it's hard to go back to it.
00:22:49 What the fuck ever.
00:22:50 Playing with good friends
00:22:51 who are interesting to talk to.
00:22:53 Playing an actually good video game
00:22:56 that isn't, like, just, you know,
00:22:58 fucking one of those fucking, like,
00:23:01 roguelike games.
00:23:02 Those fucking meme games, dude.
00:23:03 Those fucking meme games.
00:23:04 Yeah, one of those roguelike games, like,
00:23:06 I was getting kind of depressed
00:23:08 playing Nuclear Throne too much back in the day.
00:23:10 I was like, okay, I need to cut this out.
00:23:12 It's the same shit every time, you know.
00:23:14 And also working on a project.
00:23:16 Nuclear Throne, is that called
00:23:18 Donald Trump simulator?
00:23:19 Oh, ho, ho.
00:23:20 Oh, ho.
00:23:21 Oh, shit.
00:23:22 Oh, shit.
00:23:23 Oh, man, I am so nostalgic
00:23:24 for Donald Trump jokes.
00:23:25 Remember back in the day
00:23:26 when we used to,
00:23:27 when everyone used to make fun
00:23:28 of Donald Trump.
00:23:29 What happened to that?
00:23:30 Bring it back, I say.
00:23:31 Oh, yeah, bring it back, please.
00:23:33 We need more.
00:23:34 Not enough making fun of Donald Trump
00:23:36 on the internet.
00:23:37 You know, ever since I'm with her one,
00:23:39 ever since Pokémon Go to the polls won,
00:23:41 it's been, you know, just boring.
00:23:42 You know, we've just been Pokémon
00:23:44 going to the polls every day since,
00:23:46 And no one's been taking time to stop smell the roses and make fun of Donald Trump
00:23:50 Did you guys know that his skin is orange like Cheeto dust?
00:23:55 What what tell me more?
00:23:58 Also, I have it on I don't believe you. I have it on good authority
00:24:03 His hands
00:24:05 Well are small big oh
00:24:07 Oh
00:24:10 Wait, but how does this affect his dick size? What's the relationship here? I mean well
00:24:14 That's the real heart of the matter
00:24:16 I think I think the issue is that his hands are smaller than like a regular man's hands should be so maybe also
00:24:23 His penis is smaller than a regular man's penis should be which see that's why he's not my president
00:24:31 That's why I should have my election. That's why we all Pokemon went to the polls. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm feels good
00:24:37 It feels good to be a an active member of the
00:24:41 Socialist liberal agenda trying to you know anarchist for life. It's uh, it feels good
00:24:46 I don't know how true this is
00:24:49 I'd like you all to comment on whether you think it's true, but I've heard that
00:24:54 Millennials and 90 kid 90s kids or whatever they feel more nostalgic for their youth than previous generations
00:25:02 Because I've got a reason for that because the okay, go ahead things have like
00:25:07 technology and stuff has just
00:25:11 Accelerated during that time to the point where you you grow up playing with toys and then you're an adult and you've gone through
00:25:19 So many consoles and video games and things and now it's just so weird like
00:25:27 We're like mm-hmm because like our generation like
00:25:31 Guys my age like 25 to 30 or whatever like we are the very last
00:25:37 Generation that will ever have existed without the internet
00:25:41 Yeah, and I can remember a time in my life when like the internet entered my life and changed everything forever
00:25:47 And I remember what it was like before that line wire Dave line wire
00:25:50 That's why I feel like I feel this like weird like disconnect with people who are even like like four or five years younger than me
00:25:58 Because they they grew up they have this there's this culture and this language of like everything's fucking ironic
00:26:05 Everyone is like taking pride in being an autistic or like a shitty person and it's just a tag irony is a purely destructive force
00:26:11 It's it's weird like I
00:26:13 Like the this feeling that like that like people get for like generations 20 years their junior of like all these these young kids
00:26:21 Nowadays, they don't know shit. They're all fucking weird and psychotic
00:26:24 I feel that way about people five years younger than me because there's like a huge fucking divide
00:26:30 In and it's like a whole new way of thinking. Oh god. I just hate them. I hate young people
00:26:35 That's it. I'm with you and I agree with you on all that the technological
00:26:44 The rapid technological advancement, I mean you had definitely has created a a cultural tag the young all sex and nothing else
00:26:51 There is the the real phenomenon that the Millennials are the first generation in like I possibly ever
00:26:58 I think that actually has a worse economic
00:27:01 Foothold than the generation that came before them. We're over the tipping point with our generation
00:27:07 Well, that was hopefully it doesn't stay that way, but that's where it is
00:27:10 That was a point that I made a while ago
00:27:11 I don't remember where but I was just like I wonder if the reason the Millennials are so nostalgic for the 90s and shit
00:27:17 It's because we're the first generation that has nothing really to look forward to it's because when we were kids
00:27:21 We didn't have to worry about you know all kinds of bull. I mean that was I'm like the case for people who were born in the 30s
00:27:28 Like hold on. There was that whole 10-year period where the economy was total shit. So I'm sure it was the same thing for that
00:27:35 I don't know what that is
00:27:37 Well
00:27:42 Say to say it's the only time it's like an exaggeration
00:27:47 I think we're we're the first generation to really have some perspective on how doomed we are as a species because we're the first
00:27:53 Generation to like have the knowledge available to us that like in 20 years the fucking one world
00:27:59 Government is going to be raising all of our children the internet. Yeah, it's something
00:28:03 I think that is really fucking with our generation because it's fucking with me and I hate it because it's something that I never
00:28:08 Stressed to it when I was a little kid and it was it only started when the internet happened is this really like
00:28:14 broad world-wide perspective of how mediocre I am
00:28:19 Hmm because because like like back in the day before the internet you could do stuff
00:28:25 Like you know like when you sat down and play Pokemon with your friends or whatever
00:28:28 You're like, oh man
00:28:29 I'm like one of the best people at Pokemon or it's like I think there's 10 people I knew who played Pokemon now like I want to
00:28:34 Like make videos and do drawings and shit
00:28:36 I have access to the internet and I can see people in like fucking Taiwan who are like 10 years old who are gonna be better than
00:28:41 I'll ever be in my entire life and it's completely changed this perspective of like how good you are at things
00:28:48 What the like the bell curve of talent is and also like it set expectations
00:28:53 That like the the exceptions to the rule have risen to the top in this interconnected world and become the new norm
00:28:59 So it feels like that's the standard. I feel like I feel like some of that a lot of that came through from TV
00:29:06 Anyway, like TV and magazines
00:29:12 Cuz like with TV like the celebrities were at a distance, but now like Pewdiepie is just a dude in his fucking room
00:29:19 Well, like I get that I get that like the um, you know that that there's like a worldwide perspective of how mediocre you are
00:29:26 Like you said, I don't think you're mediocre by the way, but that's what you said
00:29:29 Um, I like I feel the opposite like for me the problem is that I have this worldwide perspective on how mediocre the world is and how
00:29:37 I'm just
00:29:40 Everyone is psychotic and like everyone is evil
00:29:44 It's it's that's that's my nightmare and it's awakened like I wake up to every morning
00:29:49 It's kind of similar to I was just having an existential crisis about this other day
00:29:53 And I mean I always know this on an intellectual level
00:29:56 But it really hit me as I was again playing near and which deals a lot with like the role of humanity and the end of civilization
00:30:02 All that shit like no matter what I do in my life
00:30:06 None of it will matter at all because even if humanity lives a billion years the universe will end and nothing will
00:30:14 Absolutely no traces will be left no matter what I do
00:30:18 I'm I'm fucking banking on the idea that we're gonna have like a billion years. We can hop dimensions. We can hop dimensions
00:30:24 Theoretically, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm that's what I'm banking on is that I mean like
00:30:29 Okay, our civilization was able to figure out how to break our gravity and then land on our moon within like 12,000 years of civilization
00:30:35 And only like a hundred thousand years of our species with a billion years
00:30:39 We can figure out dimensions. No biggie. You know, it's not fucking you know
00:30:42 I'll give it to you that my my more pressing concern is that will destroy ourselves. That is my main concern
00:30:47 Honestly when it comes to stuff like that
00:30:49 I think of what the human race will be that the language will have morphed if I were to travel to the future
00:30:55 English would be like no longer English
00:30:58 People would have you know change, you know
00:31:02 Strange or if they live on other planets, they'll be really yeah stuff if there's lower gravity or whatever
00:31:07 And it'll be it'll be so alien to me that it may as well not even be the human race and at that point
00:31:12 I don't really care, you know, that was another thing I was thinking about where I I have this thing where I really care about
00:31:18 Humanity survival and I like I root for humanity to go out and colonize space and then I just thought to myself
00:31:22 Why am I really so dedicated to team humanity?
00:31:26 Why is it not okay for like a superior alien race to just yeah, like that's my go with it
00:31:30 You know, that's my hope is that somewhere out there?
00:31:33 There's a there's a better race than us because if we're the best the universe has to offer the universe is fucked
00:31:40 Yeah, I want to I want to be on Picard's team where Picard's like
00:31:44 Humanity has so much potential we can evolve so we can we can you know learn from our mistakes
00:31:49 We can improve ourselves and I'm just like I'm out looking here at humanity day after day and I'm just not seeing it
00:31:56 It's pretty obvious that Hobbits were better than
00:32:01 Regression when I look at humanity, I think people are getting worse as time goes on
00:32:05 We could just be a slump. It could just be a slump. Yeah, I mean you never know
00:32:09 Well, I guess it's interesting that we're talking about this whole like humanity thing because that's never been something like I can I can
00:32:15 Understand your enthusiasm and your investment on like a logical level, but I just don't care like I guess I'm just too much of an
00:32:23 Individualist where I'm just like I don't like I want of course
00:32:25 I think it's cool like conceptually we have humanity to succeed and do all this crazy shit and become Starfleet
00:32:30 But like I'm not invested in that struggle because I'm gonna be dead in like 30 to 40 years
00:32:35 That's and it doesn't have anything to do with me like even if we succeed in a billion years
00:32:39 I'm not gonna be here to even comprehend it like you know
00:32:42 I'm with you on all that but to make things even more depressing
00:32:45 What is even the point of Starfleet to just spread humanity like a fucking cancer over the other planets and galaxies?
00:32:52 Like what's the point? What are we serving we really have a separate podcast for about futurism and the idea of what should really do?
00:32:59 We should I actually was gonna suggest this a couple days ago, and then I fell asleep interesting
00:33:02 Cuz I actually suggested it in a let's play that me digi and Ben and monkey Jones recorded last night
00:33:07 I actually
00:33:08 Well, let's not out yet is it? Oh, well, we're totally off topic right now
00:33:14 The only thing I can really say about nostalgia is basically just to bloat that like I've secured
00:33:19 I've been privileged enough both like emotionally and financially that like I've just succeeded at life
00:33:24 And like everything is better for me now
00:33:26 So like basically the only way I could imagine just talking about this is just for someone to name something that
00:33:31 So you should hypothetically be nostalgic for from the past that I'm totally not and just go down the list dude
00:33:37 What about what about back in school when you drew the little s
00:33:43 Anything
00:33:50 The way I see nostalgia is that I mean I
00:33:54 Especially hate it whenever anyone says it or implies. Oh my god. You didn't do or know this thing. You didn't have a childhood
00:34:01 That's yeah, who didn't have a childhood. He didn't make the s's
00:34:06 You're doing a funny old joke here, but I really hate that I really really hate that anybody who in who pushes their
00:34:14 Does anybody mean that seriously this and has anybody ever met that legitimately
00:34:19 They need to be punched in the face. No, no, no people people all were all the time. I mean, who does it?
00:34:25 Well, I mean do people who were born in labor wrong generation
00:34:29 I'm not I'm not I'm not even denying that you're I'm not even saying you're wrong
00:34:33 I've just never encountered anyone seriously meaning that
00:34:36 No, you mean but like I've gotten over it since then so yeah another thing is better about my life now is not caring about things
00:34:46 I was going somewhere but I figure I'll just come up with the other thing I was gonna say is that right now
00:34:52 I'm on my laptop and
00:34:54 That's because I'm away with my family at a like a weekend sort of holiday thing in the countryside
00:34:59 And it's really nice and it's stuff and it's just reminding me of like family holidays
00:35:04 Because we haven't been on a lot of those mom and dad have been going on holidays by themselves
00:35:09 For the past few years because like I don't know it's just sort of like it's weird
00:35:14 Just keep going on family holidays every year, and but now we're doing it again. It's like yeah
00:35:19 I'm not nostalgic for family holidays the last couple ones of my family had were like really boring and hard
00:35:24 That's like I just want to I just want to work on my dang videos. Yeah
00:35:28 It's not just the family holidays thing
00:35:30 But it's just like reminding me of all the stuff that you don't do or I did before like technology
00:35:36 And I'm thinking of like yeah, I used to really like
00:35:39 Stuff and places and things and and frogs and castles and and wind and trees and I like all that that's good
00:35:47 Fresh air is nice. Yeah, I sure wish I had more of it
00:35:51 one thing that I'm I don't know if I'm just I guess it's nostalgic but
00:35:56 When I you know I was living in Massachusetts my whole life my dad at a boat and we'd go out in it
00:36:00 And I never really like enjoyed going out in it because it took like all day and I would actually you know
00:36:05 I never looked forward to it, but once I was out there usually had a great time
00:36:09 But I would I used to really really enjoy going down to the marina where his boat was and just standing there feeling the sea breeze
00:36:15 And the first thing I noticed when I moved out to the Midwest and I'm in Ohio is
00:36:19 How much I fucking missed the ocean and just standing on the shore feeling the smelling the salt feeling the breeze feeling the fucking sun
00:36:27 That's where I want to be. I want to be there all the time
00:36:29 I think it's important to remember that the real world is pretty good if you're just yes. Oh, yeah, I love the real world, too
00:36:36 Yeah, fucking I I'd be going on walks all I'm gonna go on walks all the dang time as soon as my ankles finish healing
00:36:43 That's a good. That's a good thing
00:36:45 if I could live on like a
00:36:48 What's the word like a beach house
00:36:51 Right next to the fucking ocean where I could go swimming if I want and be able to come inside go into a little studio and like record
00:36:57 Podcasts and videos and edit shit. Oh
00:36:59 That'd be and then at night I could leave the windows open feel the cool ocean breeze and smell the sea
00:37:04 Oh, that would be the perfect life. That's what I want for me one day and have a big fat slut in my bed
00:37:12 Big just a real hambeast a big monster. Yeah, just smother me to death every night. That's what I want. That's what I want
00:37:19 That's my dream beautiful
00:37:22 And I guess you'd call it nostalgic. Yeah, that's like a nostalgic fantasy
00:37:27 Fago and a car full of fat chicks. That's the American dream
00:37:31 That's right
00:37:32 It's funny you mentioned the ocean because I did something rather similar like remembering how much I liked the ocean cuz um
00:37:38 I you meet me my family used to go to the beach all the time because we're in Massachusetts as well
00:37:42 So we go to go to the cave
00:37:43 We go to like Brockport like beach and stuff like that because I was really close by and go to horse neck
00:37:48 You ever go to horse neck beach? I never went to horse neck beach. Okay, just one. I missed out on that one
00:37:53 but um back when I was a kid
00:37:56 The more I got into video games the less I wanted to go to the beach because like video games beach didn't mix
00:38:01 So I was like fuck that I just want to play video games
00:38:03 And I remember like as I got older I really disliked the beach
00:38:06 but then my friend came over and
00:38:08 She lives in Missouri, so she'd never seen the beach ever in her life
00:38:12 This was like last like like last year never never gone to the beach and she's like I want to go see the beach
00:38:19 I might have fucking beaches gay who cares, but I guess you've never been there
00:38:21 So I guess we should probably go and we go and she just like freaks out and like holy shit and just like and like and like
00:38:29 It's it's it's cold. It's like it's in the winter. It's water's freezing
00:38:32 She's still like fucking runs into the water and just like
00:38:36 Experiences it. I'm just standing there and like it's the first time I've been on the beach and probably like seven or eight years
00:38:41 And like like the same kind of things like the smell of the salt and like just being there and feeling the breeze like it triggered like this like
00:38:47 Like yeah, you just look down you just look down there and you just think to self. What a fag
00:38:52 Exactly
00:38:55 It was you kind of remember what you liked and to see someone else kind of like
00:38:59 Experiencing the joy you used to have there was really really interesting. That's anything. I don't know. I appreciate it all over again
00:39:05 That's really interesting because I'm also from Missouri
00:39:07 And I also saw the beach for the first time like six months ago when I moved in with Digi and I went there and I was like, yep
00:39:13 I don't know why I'm able to be such an asshole being
00:39:17 Contrarian about every single thing people are talking about today. It's just for some reason
00:39:21 Deville you've created life and turn us all into wrestling. Well, that's all you're the mortal
00:39:26 That's where the arch nemesis of the PCB are villain from within. Yeah, you know, it's fine. We expect it
00:39:31 It's I mean, I was there when you first discovered sand and that was quite weird
00:39:37 Yeah, to see someone discover sand like big amounts of sand on under your feet
00:39:42 That was a sand box and it was like a different kind of sand. I was like, oh different texture
00:39:46 Yeah, I was pretty interested in the sand the beach part, which I guess I guess a beach is half sand half ocean
00:39:52 So I guess I was half interested in the ocean now
00:39:55 It's cool
00:39:59 I like when you go out on to like a playground and
00:40:04 And there's like the tarmac and there's like little girls there and they're like not being watched by their parents
00:40:09 And you can just like
00:40:12 Go to the playground and you sit and it's like a summer day and the playground's been all like heated up
00:40:19 That's all right guys secretary just walked in. She's being a goddamn bother
00:40:24 Well, shut up secretary. I'm telling a story
00:40:26 I'm telling a story about how I like it when you go sit on a tarmac and you got your hands and you put it on the ground
00:40:33 Yeah, that's hot, but then it's okay after a while. It's like, yeah, I know the exact feeling
00:40:38 And it's like there's no one around because it's sort of the end of the day
00:40:42 And then parents are taking their kids and you're like still there
00:40:46 Because you know, you're a little bit older and you're allowed to stay out a little longer
00:40:50 And it's like, yeah, I'm I really enjoy the playground and now I can't go there anymore because it's gay and I'm a pedophile I guess
00:40:58 So this meme of of raping children is bad go away
00:41:03 When will that me man, you know, I'm ready for it to swing the pendulum to swing the other way for a while
00:41:10 Sex with the child's
00:41:12 Whoa
00:41:18 Like yeah, that's right. That's you you got some
00:41:23 Every every day I run the risk a little bit more of them discovering all these things and me getting
00:41:29 I'm getting a little bit of heat for it, but not so far so good
00:41:32 So feels feels good and you know what I kind of want it so that I'll be fired and be forced to be a YouTube's man
00:41:38 So, you know kind of a
00:41:42 Playgrounds did anybody like
00:41:44 Using the monkey bar that said no one tell them no one tell them
00:41:47 Did anybody use the monkey bars? I was like a monkey bars champion. I can yeah, I was fucking outlawed those shits
00:41:53 I don't know in America
00:41:58 Because you know, it's it's lobbyists with their conflicting goals
00:42:01 It's like you got the you got the bureaucrats office and waiting to meet in
00:42:05 Damn big
00:42:09 There's the there's the very concerned mother gonna talk about obesity with children
00:42:13 But then there's a very concerned mother talking about the children who get hurt whenever they go out and be active and burn calories
00:42:18 And I guess just last decade the fucking burn calories getting hurt mom was just more upset than the other one
00:42:25 So that's how things yeah
00:42:28 What about right when you when you're a little kid and you fall over and you scrape your knee and it's like ow and there's blood and
00:42:35 Then you come home, and then it's like a day later or half a day later. There's like a scab. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah picking that that's scab
00:42:42 That's a nostalgic. I don't get scabs anymore. You know what you're powerful
00:42:46 You were talking about being nostalgic for like monkey bars and stuff, you know that reminded me
00:42:52 When I was a kid in elementary school, we used to have monkey bars
00:42:55 Monkey bars
00:43:00 That guy's weaseled his way into my fucking brain
00:43:03 He's changed my perception of monkeys forever
00:43:06 But uh, you know we used to have monkey bars
00:43:10 We used to have like a real playground at a certain point like they renovated the playground and like they tore everything down
00:43:15 And like made new stuff and the new stuff was like
00:43:20 It was like all wooden it was like there was like a big like monster made out of tires
00:43:23 And there was like you know everything was like made out of like tires and rubber and wood and stuff and at the time
00:43:28 You were like oh wow this new playground is even cooler, but looking back on it. That was just garbage
00:43:33 They just built the playground out of old tires and shit. Oh, yeah, my whole life has been we were playing on garbage
00:43:38 You know what I'm I am
00:43:41 Nostalgic for actual good playgrounds
00:43:42 I will say because that is something that has definitely declined in my lifetime like because of safety concerns
00:43:48 Mm-hmm all playgrounds. They get renovated and become boring and shitty like gay grounds
00:43:53 Okay, you know what the problem is here. The problem is people are our two hyper
00:43:58 Individualized they're not folks enough on community and I mean this sincerely cuz everything go in a communists back again
00:44:06 One mom sees her child a trip and get a splinter on the wooden playground
00:44:11 She decides this is this needs to stop this can never happen to her child or you know
00:44:15 I get maybe any other child ever again
00:44:17 So they tear that motherfucker down and they build like a stainless steel
00:44:21 Monstrosity in its place
00:44:27 Vaccine and you know what it's amazing that how like one out of every
00:44:33 100,000 kids will die from a vaccine and that mom is super good remember vaccines guys. That was great
00:44:38 I miss all right. I love autism. I'm all about autism
00:44:42 But anyway Jesse, what are you saying? That sounds like the opposite of what you're saying is it sounds like if you're saying
00:44:47 No one else can have the playground because they might get hurt like Mike did that sounds like putting the
00:44:51 community before individual rights
00:44:54 Well, it's like okay. The everyone loves the playground is what is the is the fictional thing?
00:44:59 I'm constructing my brain everyone loves this playground one child gets hurt in a way that any child could get hurt at any time
00:45:05 And they decide that the playground is like a threat and should be
00:45:12 Personal responsibility just like I didn't take good enough care of my kid
00:45:16 So I'm gonna blame it on the state and their shitty playground or people need to accept if my child fucking
00:45:22 Accidentally hung himself by his fucking shoelaces on the playground. That does not necessarily mean the playground is dangerous
00:45:34 Humanities need to find a someone to blame in every situation
00:45:39 Someone needs to take the fall when my child accidentally strangled himself when my way child accidentally
00:45:45 Was masturbating and choking himself and he died that's on the monkey
00:45:53 Accidentally choked himself masturbating on the monkey bars and was reborn as
00:45:57 And that's the canon origin
00:46:03 See but that's what I'm talking about like
00:46:05 People need to people need to see that like okay just because this thing happened doesn't mean even if it was legitimately the things
00:46:12 Faults if it does more good than bad. It's still worth having even if there is a threat
00:46:17 Just I don't know make people aware of it. I don't know this this always drives me crazy people think like that
00:46:22 Something similar to playgrounds is a big old play places with with the climbing frames that you just yeah
00:46:32 They're still around I'm sure but they they seem to be
00:46:35 they aren't they're like they were like a
00:46:38 supposedly like a
00:46:40 Not a biohazard, but it's like they were they weren't sanitary so they got rid of them. Yeah, well all of them
00:46:46 Pretty much at least in America. They're pretty mean. I'm talking about like play places for McDonald's
00:46:51 Yeah, you can't go to like
00:46:52 Well, I've never been to a McDonald's. I had one of those but oh yeah into a couple places that were specifically
00:46:59 Like like like a warehouse where you could just set your kid loose. Yeah, like um well play places
00:47:05 I know they don't build any more of those but like here well in the Midwest where I used to be
00:47:09 I still saw plenty of those. They just never tore them down, right?
00:47:12 Yeah, I think there's one particular the one that used to be my hometown where they did tear it down
00:47:17 And they replaced it with this thing
00:47:18 It was like that was like
00:47:20 Still was kind of a play place in that it was literally just one tunnel that led to one slide and that was so and that was it
00:47:26 I was so fucking pissed and most of it most of it most of it was video games
00:47:32 And I'm like yep. This is this is what's wrong with the world, you know, this is
00:47:36 This is what's wrong with you. This is what's wrong with talking about okay
00:47:40 Finish your fun. This is what's wrong with fucking parental guidance where it's like everyone's like man
00:47:43 Why are all the Millennials us sitting around in their houses?
00:47:45 I mean, maybe it's because Millennials were told if you fucking go out of the house where we can't see you you will
00:47:51 Trip and fall and break your nose and then get abducted and molested
00:47:55 And so all you can do is is play in this like three by three, you know back there are there are dramatically less
00:48:01 Crimes committed in America including like kidnappings and you know pedophilia charges now
00:48:07 Then there were in like the 50s and yet now we have far more regulation than ever on all this shit
00:48:13 So like what what what the fuck? Oh, I think it might have been
00:48:16 I mean, I think the regulation might have helped a bit because since there were no key there were less kids out
00:48:22 Right exactly like maybe it was just died out. They just walked around until I mean
00:48:27 I advocate that we need to sacrifice some children to the pedophiles in order to save them in order to avoid large pedophiles
00:48:34 You know
00:48:36 Pedophile dance like like you've tied the pedophiles
00:48:40 Great pedophiles we sacrifice days to you the giant pedophile king comes out of the mountains
00:48:47 Yeah, I think video games are good enough. I can I can be in my room all the time
00:48:50 I don't fucking do it speaking of fucking nostalgia
00:48:53 I just had a had an acid flashback to in a McDonald's play place
00:48:57 There was this like I can't really remember what it was, but there was like this weird
00:49:01 Game slash like animated cartoon thing that played barbaran by the fucking beach boys
00:49:07 And there was like a story of like a guy trying to like woo this nurse girl
00:49:11 I think and he couldn't get her
00:49:13 But then he was about to die because he was doing some stunt to impress her and then she saved him
00:49:18 Then they were like happily ever after in love. Oh my god
00:49:22 That's are you sure that was it's been it's been in my brain for like 20 years
00:49:26 It was a it was like part of some interactive McDonald's play place thing, man
00:49:31 I just trip. I just I'm nostalgia for recess recess was fucking cool
00:49:36 ban it
00:49:37 It's it's it's ableist recess is ableist the the kids who are in wheelchairs can't play dodgeball
00:49:43 so I have I have a lot of nostalgia for
00:49:47 Play we called it play time
00:49:50 Because we go out and play and there's like
00:49:52 There was a whole game. I don't know. I don't know whether
00:49:56 There's probably not a game that was like anyone ever plays, but we had like and we had like a
00:50:02 Lines on on the on the playground for like football and basketball or whatever
00:50:07 Yeah, and sometimes there would be like a couple squares and we put we would play this game called to square with like up to four players
00:50:14 Where you get a ball and somebody just spikes it or like or hits it like as if it was
00:50:20 Volleyball, but not like an actual volleyball hit
00:50:22 They just hit it however they like and the other person just has to get the ball onto the other square and have it bounce once
00:50:28 It's like a combination tennis, but without a net and we call that we called that four square
00:50:33 Yeah, that's the exact same game, and I was the fucking champion. I'll fight anyone in four square
00:50:38 Well, yeah, we had four squares. It was divided to four instead of two
00:50:41 I guess I will fight anyone at a four square at any time. I'm a fucking planet and
00:50:46 When we went I wasn't at school because not you know people weren't always playing it
00:50:50 I wasn't really the sort of person to grab a ball and get people around to play to square
00:50:55 So I would just get like a ball with my brother at home
00:51:00 Just randomly and we would go on to the driveway and we would play there
00:51:03 And it would that would be I would just do that for hours
00:51:06 I'll that would be the the funnest thing ever just to play to square on the driveway with a ball
00:51:11 Fuck video games over my video games. I don't even like them. They're not even cool. What do we talk about?
00:51:18 You know, okay, I'm with it
00:51:19 We talked all about a bunch of nostalgia shit, but let me let me ask you guys
00:51:22 I wanted to this we've touched on this a few times already
00:51:25 But like so and it gives video was kind of about this so is nostalgia
00:51:29 Actually a good justified thing and or is it just a shitty thing that as an adult you have
00:51:37 Is there any value I haven't answered this weird demonization of nostalgia is just like a weird contrarian cynical internet culture thing
00:51:45 And I think it needs to die. I
00:51:48 Think I say in my video that people generally think nostalgia goggles are
00:51:52 Like something to be ashamed of or avoided and it's like who cares. It's it's something you like it makes you happy
00:51:58 So what are the well as long as your arguments are sound? Yeah, that's for me
00:52:02 Nostalgia that nostalgia that I feel for specific video games is
00:52:07 Like lately like can be a reason to go back and play the video game
00:52:10 But nostalgia like is like a fuel source that does get burnt out by going back to the game, right?
00:52:16 Like I've I've gone black back and played Superstar saga out of nostalgia like probably two or three
00:52:22 Well a bunch of times and eventually it's like I've played the game so many times, you know, it's a linear RPG
00:52:27 It's a single-player RPG. There's not that much replay value 13 times
00:52:31 Is enough time just that's what people I think people accuse you of like nostalgia goggles when they're trying to like
00:52:37 Shit on something you like or like, you know, they say you just think it's good because of nostalgia
00:52:42 But that's not true like like Final Fantasy 7 for example, they'll be like, oh that game is not even good
00:52:48 You like it because you're nostalgic for like no, I'm not I play it like every year
00:52:53 I've played it like a billion times. Maybe the first time I went back and played it there was nostalgia
00:52:58 I have no fucking nostalgia for that game anymore whatsoever. It's just a good game that I like
00:53:03 Yeah, yeah
00:53:06 There are definitely things
00:53:08 That are not good that I have nostalgia for and that makes me think that they're good
00:53:13 But as an adult as an adult a
00:53:16 I try to figure out whether it's nostalgia or not and if it is nostalgia
00:53:21 I will still let myself enjoy it, but I won't tell anybody that it's good
00:53:24 I will just tell them that I'm nostalgic for it and that will sort of make sure that they don't
00:53:29 Hate it like but sex, you know, you always look back on but sex and you have this nostalgia for it like yeah
00:53:35 Yeah, totally cool. I want to do that again. They do it again, and you're like, oh wait. Yeah
00:53:39 Oh, yeah, this is a butthole where poop comes out of this isn't good at all. Why do I have nostalgia for this?
00:53:47 You always go back to the but
00:53:50 95 shit that I'm nostalgic for and if I see it again
00:53:54 I'm gonna be like whoa
00:53:55 I remember that and then like in the course of like 20 seconds the amount that I care because of the nostalgia is gonna wear
00:54:01 Off into nothing. It's like it's you know, it's it doesn't last that long the nostalgia trip
00:54:05 Is there anything wrong with that? No, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm just saying that's how it is for me and
00:54:10 There's a very simple test. I think I feel like there are some people who like just because their lives went to shit
00:54:17 Like they really depend on the nostalgic memories to get by like I feel like people like movie Bob kind of come off that way to me
00:54:24 Sometimes we're like he's just so endlessly obsessed with Super Mario Bros. 3 and I'm like, you know
00:54:30 There's not that much of Super Mario Bros 3, but it's just because you know, I mean he's fat
00:54:35 So he needs this, you know, that's true. He is very happiness. He came. I'm sure he has
00:54:38 Yeah, exactly. I feel like I feel like it's because there are definitely certain people out there who have like like too much
00:54:45 Fixation or like like like like um people liked the nostalgia critic who Doug Walker started that series because he was 25 and
00:54:53 Going through a nostalgic phase. That's what he said
00:54:56 But it ended up becoming a this arch platform that he then made into his job
00:55:01 And so he's had to continue like like like dwelling on that nostalgic phase for like ten fucking years now
00:55:07 And so I think when people see that they sort of get this perception that there are these people who just drown in nostalgia endlessly
00:55:15 And I think it's probably the case for some people
00:55:17 But it's mostly just because it makes for a good YouTube show in the mid in the late 2000s
00:55:21 And so they get this they get this perception that like oh, you know when they see Jesse
00:55:25 They're like, oh, he's still talking about Final Fantasy 7. It's because he's just like that, you know
00:55:29 I think that's where the misconception comes from for some people
00:55:33 If you can defend I mean whatever point you make ever if you ever if you're accused of fucking nostalgia
00:55:39 Just like if you can defend your point intelligently, that's it there. There is there's no case
00:55:47 Like what nostalgia just means like you remember something fondly from your childhood like even if it's fucking shit
00:55:53 Like like I watched and loved as a kid the dub of Monster Rancher and I watch it now
00:55:57 And it's fucking the worst shit of all time. Yeah, but you know what?
00:56:01 I still remember that fondly because I like that is
00:56:05 Something there's you don't need like to put together some like
00:56:09 So here in like five-page essay arguing why you like it
00:56:12 I think that if someone did you bro if someone is saying that what you like is not good
00:56:17 Then the burden of proof is on them
00:56:19 If you're saying that something is bad and people shouldn't like it then you're the one who should have to fucking state your case
00:56:26 Intelligently and if you can't then fuck you get the fuck out of here
00:56:30 My hope
00:56:32 YouTube channel is based on the idea that I want to figure out whether my nostalgia is there is valid or not
00:56:39 Because I want to figure out whether the game is good despite the fact that I really like it
00:56:43 That sounds like my all-time favorite youtuber cat Icarus. It's time to find out which games need to be salvaged or slaughtered
00:56:50 He's got the two guns
00:56:52 He's got he's got the salvage gun and he's got the slaughtered gun. You ever see that? Oh god
00:57:02 My final fantasy 7 I think is Frogger
00:57:05 He's back the the Frogger remake from the late 90s that I played the shit out of as a kid and like the only real difference is that as an
00:57:12 Adult I'm I can understand why it's so good like it really is um, but not good
00:57:17 It's not good in the way that most people would agree with it just so happens to like do almost everything
00:57:22 I want a video game to be I have a that reminds me of a
00:57:27 of a
00:57:28 Story with a point about nostalgia or something probably it's probably vaguely related to this topic
00:57:33 I don't I don't fucking know but I don't know maybe I've even told the story before I don't fucking know
00:57:36 But when I was a kid it was like like Easter or like 1998 or some shit Easter or 1998 one or the other it couldn't have been
00:57:46 Those two things contradict each other
00:57:49 But you know, I really wanted my mom was gonna get me like a present
00:57:54 And I really wanted the legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time for the n64. That was the the hot new
00:58:00 Game the the hot new mobile app as we call games today for all you
00:58:06 Yep, so I really wanted Ocarina of Time and I'm like, okay
00:58:11 Give me can you please give me this game mom and she she comes back from the store and she goes
00:58:17 Well, I thought at the store instead of getting you just one sixty dollar game
00:58:22 Oh, I'll get you. Oh, no two thirty dollar games
00:58:26 So it's even better
00:58:28 It's two games and your mom is part of the reason that those red box
00:58:33 Those red box ripoff movies like Atlantic Rim exists, right? And and uh, well like what an indictment
00:58:46 The story yet the two games that she got me instead of Ocarina of Time
00:58:53 Get out of my drawers. What are you doing?
00:58:56 The secretary get around here. She's going through my pajamas. She's putting on my clothes
00:59:02 She's fucking digging through my fucking my stuff. She's stealing my toys and my games
00:59:07 She's playing with my money toaster on the table. She's pocketing all my fucking loose dollar bills. What are you doing?
00:59:14 No
00:59:17 Gasol women
00:59:20 Now she's she's got her pants off now, I don't know what she wants
00:59:25 Well, I don't know about you, but I'm offended. This is
00:59:30 I'm still telling the story, but I'm looking at a pussy right now and I want to touch it
00:59:34 I'm still telling the story. Nobody interrupt me
00:59:37 Okay, go
00:59:40 Get out of my PJs
00:59:42 Oh
00:59:57 Man we're off the rails now
01:00:01 They all have holes in the crotch if you want to wear my pants you have to deal with
01:00:06 You're not gonna find a pair in there. That's magically intact
01:00:13 It would take it would take magic to find pants, which don't have a hole in the crotch
01:00:18 It would take you know what I'm packing. You know the power
01:00:22 It does the pants
01:00:26 I'm gonna touch your bus if you if you don't stop getting naked. He's just putting out all my pants
01:00:32 None of my pants are safe. He's just switching between pairs of pajamas
01:00:40 We're never gonna know
01:00:43 I really want to know these two games
01:00:46 Was it shinobi 2 and 3
01:00:50 Was it earthworm Jim
01:00:53 Okay, now she's in my bed. Hopefully she's fucking satisfied for now. She's dead
01:00:59 Even though a woman has never been satisfied when in your bed previously, but maybe this would be the exception
01:01:07 Nate stop projecting
01:01:12 Never okay
01:01:16 So so she gets me these two games I'm still tongue story. This was all part of the story everything that
01:01:23 That part happens every time I tell the story
01:01:27 Important chapter in the tail
01:01:29 There's like a flash forward to like when I'm 27 and there's a secretary in my room
01:01:35 It's a narrative device. It's like that Ferris Bueller story. I mean not Ferris Bueller fucking Princess Bride
01:01:40 It's like a story being told from the future. Yeah, it's the framing device of like right, right
01:01:48 So the two games she got me instead of Ocarina of Time we're bust a move to and
01:01:56 Frogger on ps1 and so what ps1? I love bus to move. I love bus to move
01:02:02 Yeah, so like I was like really disappointed like what is this shit was the other one bust a move in Frogger
01:02:08 Bust a Frogger whoa
01:02:10 You were just talking about Frogger and how great it is and now you're acting like you don't know what it is
01:02:15 You're your audio your audio cut it a weird way. That's all
01:02:19 God damn it
01:02:20 So let's just clarify bust to move to and frog. Yes the frogger. Okay. That's got you
01:02:26 Got you. I was audio literally edited your fucking audio connection literally edited you into saying bust a frogger on my end
01:02:33 That's true. It literally did
01:02:36 Bust a frog. Well, we all know that if you bust a frogger every day, that's his source of power
01:02:41 So I was disappointed there's the point of the story
01:02:45 I was like all these games are probably not good and not even good and not even good
01:02:48 I wanted the other game, but you know, I played them and it turned out they were pretty good
01:02:53 I had a lot of fun them and I'm still very nostalgic for those two games to this day
01:02:56 And that is the point of the story and that's how it goes into the topic at hand which is nostalgia and I'm sorry
01:03:02 I even told the story. I'm sorry. I even try to say everything
01:03:07 If we ever do a let's play it should be fucking frogger for ps1
01:03:10 That's I agree sure
01:03:11 Because I came I want to do bust a move to
01:03:14 Yeah, let's do a bust a move to play because my mom loved bust a move and got me
01:03:18 It's like the only video game ever that my mom got me into well the only video game ever
01:03:24 Yeah, it's the one it's the one video game
01:03:27 I have heard of it. What does it you do? Do you bust a move?
01:03:30 But no, you know, it's the game where you bubbles and it's like bubble-bobble
01:03:34 It's the same like little mascot characters from bubble-bobble if you ever heard of that shit those little cute little dinosaur guys and
01:03:41 And you fucking and it's like a puzzle game
01:03:45 There's bubbles you and you got to match the colors you shoot them out of a little cannon and you match three of them
01:03:50 And you can get combos and fucking you
01:03:52 Fuck up. It's sort of like Tetris only you combine colors
01:03:57 Yeah, and you know what?
01:04:00 You reminded me of how
01:04:01 Mad I was I didn't get my money's worth with the Nintendo Wii because neither of my parents enjoyed it at all
01:04:07 Unlike what the commercials said like that for me was the biggest betrayal of Nintendo
01:04:11 Just because my parents are too fucking old even for the Wii like my dad top 10 anime betrayals
01:04:16 Yeah parents did not enjoy my dad said like there's just no video game that I can relax to and that's
01:04:22 The only reason he consumes art is to relax
01:04:26 My dad's remember the Nintendo Wii
01:04:30 Yeah, that's what they actually used to call it. It's like you're in
01:04:36 The Mario Galaxy was a fun game
01:04:41 I actually do have nostalgia your referencing old AVG in episodes that are from the future from the past
01:04:47 Well, yeah, I'm nostalgic old man nostalgic for that episode. I'm also nostalgic about the Wii and also
01:04:55 Specifically playing golf with my dad on the Wii golf. That was cool. He really liked that. That's cool
01:05:03 The angry video game nerd was like was a guy like nostalgic about old games and now most of us are really nostalgic
01:05:10 About the early angry video game nerd episodes. I know right? He still does. Yeah, it's still great
01:05:15 But you know, but particularly the old old episodes. There's just something there's just a timeless quality to them
01:05:20 Of course
01:05:22 It is I kind of ironic that the nostalgic critic hasn't ever made anything that's good
01:05:28 Disagree, I think he's made some okay. What I mean is a not nostalgic for any particular episode
01:05:34 He's not as rewatchable. You know what I'll give you I'll give him one thing
01:05:38 I really liked of his was I mean, okay, his reviews are all the same
01:05:41 He just talks about shit that happened. But yeah, when he reviewed
01:05:44 He's an integral part of what got me into the room so much
01:05:48 Yeah, I watch his review of the room and so it's always been part of the room experience for me
01:05:52 And I'll watch that to this day and laugh
01:05:54 It's a good one. See I'm nostalgic for one thing that he's made. There you go. There you go, Doug. You're welcome
01:05:59 I'm nostalgic for kikassia and all those things. Oh, yeah, kikassia was fun
01:06:05 But I mean like it wasn't I don't know what that is
01:06:08 Well, I'm the first big that guy with the glasses used to do I mean big old crossover movies, which
01:06:15 Progressively got more and more elaborate and stupider
01:06:20 It was always like me the only good part about the about any of them was Spoonie because he was the only person on the website
01:06:26 Who was funny and like had any kind of charisma
01:06:29 And eventually they like fired him from the site and so then there was no reason to ever go to the site again
01:06:34 We see my problem is that like I just fundamentally hate 90% of the people on that website at any given time, right?
01:06:39 So like when the third one happened and Todd in the shadows showed up. I'm like, oh sweet finally. There's like, okay, Doug
01:06:46 Nostalgia chick. I like her and fucking Todd in the shadows. That's like three guys. Fuck. Do you guys all like Todd in the shadows?
01:06:52 He's writing is terrible. He's boring as fuck. I don't like anything about you, Nate. I hate him
01:06:56 He's not a good boy, but I don't know why these guys like you and did you talking about how much you like Todd in the shadows
01:07:02 And you get people like like Phyllis and people like other they're all just fat white guys, you know
01:07:07 And it's just like oh, they're all the same fucking born
01:07:10 That the thing I liked though. Are you saying that you like him because he's not white? Is that your reasoning here?
01:07:15 The thing the thing I I am I liked about the fact that so many of them were annoying and stupid is that I could imagine myself
01:07:22 You know as a young
01:07:24 Loser kid like becoming an internet reviewer and joining the site just so that I could be there and do it better than they could
01:07:31 Yeah, unfortunately, I got disillusioned to the whole thing by the time I'm actually making yeah now
01:07:36 You're doing the AVGN style in my opinion kind of sort of better than the AVGN does
01:07:41 In my opinion if hypocrite reviews becomes like 50 episodes long
01:07:45 Then I think I would if it becomes a hundred episodes along then I would like it then more than the first hundred episodes of AVGN
01:07:51 Slightly but still hmm just my opinion man
01:07:55 Get in Gib. I am right now
01:07:59 Well, I'm not right now
01:08:01 Well, okay, I feel like we've gone pretty deep into that. How about we shifted to questions? Is that is that cool?
01:08:07 Let's go. I just want to say that revenge of Shinobi on PS
01:08:11 I mean on PS on Sega Genesis was the fucking coolest and I'm nostalgic for that first level
01:08:17 Because it's really hard but it's really cool and we didn't talk about 16-bit games because you're all fucking young and I hate all of you
01:08:23 Yeah, yeah, I'm with you there. We didn't talk about anything important. We just talked about a bunch of we need to do
01:08:28 You know that thankfully we should just do like another nostalgia podcast in like a couple weeks
01:08:33 And then we can be nostalgic for this podcast and then also talk about the actual nostalgic stuff that we all neglected this time
01:08:39 I think I think I might be even though we spent
01:08:44 I think I might be one of the only
01:08:47 Procrastinators that didn't grow up on 16 bit at all. I didn't even know what an SNES was for like you didn't grow up on SNES
01:08:55 Well, no, I I the only reason I know about what an SNES is is because the ABG and talked about it
01:09:09 I primarily grew up on PC and I just didn't play any good games. I had like only three good games for my childhood
01:09:16 It's so easy to not be nostalgic because like all the games I played were shit
01:09:21 Haha, hey, you have nostalgia for your trampoline. No, I only got a trampoline when I was like 14
01:09:28 That's a number of years
01:09:30 Not long enough to be nostalgic because like mainly the memory I have is spending my childhood wishing I had a trampoline
01:09:37 Okay, well, do you think okay? That's interesting
01:09:40 Do you think when you die you will have more internalized the feeling of wishing you had a trampoline or actually having had a trampoline?
01:09:47 What's more to the being of Davoo honestly the main the main feeling that sticks out to me is like everyone liking that video more than I do and
01:09:54 Like me being so mathful that how much people like that video and let me in like well, okay nice
01:10:00 Totally surprises me for all it was just a nice. It was just a nice wholesome like yeah, this is why trampolines are good
01:10:06 I'm like yeah, it is I get it though
01:10:09 It's got no other pretenses of them to be night a nice little funny video about trampolines. That's true. That's true
01:10:15 It's not like a guys. Here's my epic Zelda breath of the wild review. It's new. It's a video
01:10:20 loves video games
01:10:22 Let's what what last thing before we go to questions. I just remembered this anyone else
01:10:28 Nostalgic, I know you are I know the answers. Yes, there is some porn out there that I am super nostalgic for like
01:10:35 Anyone remember Heather I have I deep throat calm. Come on
01:10:40 Everyone that she's the deep throat Queen everyone loves Heather Brooke. She's a champion
01:10:45 It was like the first porn I was ever introduced to by outside friends
01:10:49 I am change the game nostalgic for like a few early
01:10:53 Bang bros things
01:10:55 Did you ever watch Bruno be I remember Bruno be that is I was just like a
01:11:01 Never I've never to this day watched or read Naruto, but whenever I see the character designs
01:11:05 I think about a lot of my early masturbation. That's for sure
01:11:10 Shout out to shout out to acid head does some shout out to porn
01:11:18 masturbation I get nostalgic for Naruto
01:11:23 Also in Bible black also the one of the first hence I ever saw also the best that there are I can fire emblem fan art
01:11:31 The first the first inclination I ever had the people could draw
01:11:37 Characters from things in sexual ways
01:11:41 No, I remember fan art right flourina specifically. She had her panties show in I was like what you can see that
01:11:49 Oh, no
01:11:53 Christian sensibilities, no
01:11:58 All right, well there you go
01:12:01 Yes, so let's let's go to questions. Here we go. It's do it. Okay. We got a bunch here
01:12:06 Here is okay. Here's a question. That's that's I think is interesting
01:12:11 Is there any okay, right at an untitled ab
01:12:16 Abrogda, it's like an untitled abridger, but it's weird Tony this this guy tweets the procrastiners all the time
01:12:21 He says is there anything is there anything good about politics favorite political leader? Yes of any definition slash
01:12:29 All it takes are cool until it's like
01:12:31 300 million people right
01:12:33 Like when you watch like maybe like some TV show that involves politics and it's like it's like okay
01:12:38 Okay, the fucking chairman election art from the end of hunter hunter
01:12:41 It's like it's like politics, but only like 300 people are involved and it's got a lot of it's a clash of really interesting
01:12:47 personalities with a lot of really interesting shit and like when you see those tiny countries of like three million people
01:12:53 There's still a lot of personality that comes through
01:12:55 But you know how like the more
01:12:57 Participants you get in something the more it averages out like the more that you flip a coin the more it becomes 50 50
01:13:03 Like the problem with America is it so many fucking people that the only people who can end up becoming nominees are like these weird fucking
01:13:10 Bullshit blends of different opinions that make no fucking sense and it becomes utterly depressing
01:13:15 So the problem with America is it's too big and that's why our politics are so annoying now
01:13:21 It is it is possible that in our in our internet age that we're in now like human beings are in maybe maybe human beings are
01:13:29 Like what's the word? I'm looking for lethally tribal
01:13:33 And that as we're more and more exposed to the other people that actually share the country with us
01:13:37 We're finding out like holy shit. I share the country with these people fuck that and it's it's gonna cause more dissent
01:13:44 There's too many people and the people are too uneducated and that's the problem
01:13:50 Politics forms is nothing but a mental cancer and once it's in people's brains it invariably turns them into worse human beings
01:13:58 I don't disagree. I just want to say lethally tribal Aurora mage
01:14:08 Lethal lava land from Super Mario 64
01:14:12 Yes, I I want to actually defend politics for a second and
01:14:18 Cuz you're gay
01:14:21 All I have to say is remember Ross you from
01:14:27 Fucking girl
01:14:30 What Ross you represents is is well, I would I would normally say like a what's the word a
01:14:37 God, what's the fucking word for someone who like Bush benevolent a benevolent despot is the word?
01:14:41 I was looking for which is a term for like a
01:14:44 Dictator who like has the legitimately has the best interests of the people in mind
01:14:47 But Ross you wasn't even a dictator or like a despot or anything. He was just elected
01:14:52 Doing it, but so like if you I'm doing it everybody's possible. What do you do it on my secretary's pants? That'll fucking show her
01:15:03 Both agree that the only way to defend politics is better than my pants. Yeah
01:15:09 They're all elastic and I think I think it's because political intrigue is interesting politics is dry and boring
01:15:16 No, no, no, but see the the okay, but the thing about Ross you is Ross you as a hero
01:15:20 Spends Ross you was a politician who spent like 50 fucking years just toiling and toiling and toiling to make sure that you know
01:15:28 All the spiral races work together and shit
01:15:29 And we see exactly none of the hard work that actually went into making sure everything went smoothly
01:15:36 So that everyone didn't kill each other and like just like in real life. We're bored
01:15:40 We're endlessly bored by by the nitty-gritty of what it takes to actually run a society properly
01:15:46 And so in the anime they fucking skip that and they just tell us it was really hard
01:15:50 But it went well, but what it it's in real life
01:15:53 You have to actually like live the life of a guy spending a thousand years
01:15:58 I see most politics is interesting, but most politicians are boring because like they
01:16:04 Like what it takes to make a politician you have to like yeah, I sure have a static
01:16:09 before the
01:16:12 Yeah, I just wanted to talk about how cool Ross you is
01:16:17 That's I that's the answer. He's he's a hero guys. He's a hero next question. Okay next question. Um, okay, what?
01:16:23 Oh, what's his face at?
01:16:26 kick
01:16:27 Can kink kuck kink kuck right kink kuck asks what is the best fast food?
01:16:33 Restaurants five guys also why a restaurant so shit. They're all terrible guys. They all don't deserve to exist. I
01:16:39 Agree, I mean you say five guys five guys like tastes like an actual burger that was made at home basically
01:16:45 What counts as fast food if it doesn't carry house cuss count as fast food
01:16:52 That's like sit down. That's like a sit-down place. Yeah, I usually order that in or take away. It's like
01:16:59 Reasonably quick. I'll say it counts. Yeah, whatever. I'm gonna say Domino's pan pizza because I'm getting that as soon as this podcast is over
01:17:07 I would have already ordered my store is currently unavailable for online ordering and I'm kind of wait
01:17:12 I got it online ordering right now. I got it fish and chips the the English classic fish and chips
01:17:18 Wait, that is chips. Is that a restaurant? It's fries. It's no, it's just a food
01:17:23 It's battered fish with with fried chips and it's it's fast and it's food and I like it and efficient chips is efficient
01:17:32 Yes. Oh
01:17:34 Nice nice. I by the way, I got a fish in my shoulder. I
01:17:39 Hate I hate fast food. I think it's a cancer on the world and
01:17:44 What one time I was watching some show on the food network that was like it was like chopped
01:17:48 it was like a competition between cooks and
01:17:51 There was one cook there like the others, you know, they try to make tasty food
01:17:54 There was one there whose whose main emphasis is to make healthy food that people will feel good and improve their lives when they eat
01:18:00 She got voted out in the first round because she didn't load enough salt and oil and bullshit into her food and tried to actually care about
01:18:08 The people who she was serving to whereas the other people only gave a shit about what instantly was the most
01:18:13 Instant gratification eating it and I think that really speaks to humanity at large
01:18:17 We treat food like it's something to make us feel good and not fuel cells that we need to power
01:18:21 I'm absolutely a hundred percent on board with you. I think I think taste buds are the worst thing and they should be genetically
01:18:29 Added out of
01:18:31 I think the worst thing that we that we have in our bodies is the butthole
01:18:36 Because we
01:18:57 I would here's the fucking tier list for fast food, right?
01:19:00 It's like okay
01:19:00 There's Burger King which tastes terrible makes you feel terrible makes you want to go on a killing spree
01:19:05 Then there's stuff like McDonald's and Wendy's which has like this like half second
01:19:09 Mmm, tasty when you put it in your mouth, but you just feel gross during and after it feels unsatisfying
01:19:13 I don't know if I put McDonald's above Burger King
01:19:16 I definitely I put Burger King way below all the others. It doesn't even taste good
01:19:20 But anyway, so then you have stuff like five guys, which is like it tastes great
01:19:24 And then I feel great as long as I haven't been eating just this right as long as it's in the occasional
01:19:30 The exception to the rule when I eat something giant and greasy and ketchup now to boo
01:19:34 Oh, man, this is a very typical argument to have here. You're advocating for like that. Oh, I'm a I'm a I'm a free American
01:19:41 I can eat whatever I want
01:19:42 But the fact of the matter is fast food is garbage and no one should eat it at any time in their life
01:19:46 I don't want people to have the freedom to eat it. It's not much worse for you
01:19:50 Good for your soul SpongeBob SpongeBob's dead because I murdered him so
01:19:54 Is your tear list based on the amount of tears you cry when you absolutely freaking Lutely, yeah, yeah
01:20:03 Here's a here's a question that's never been addressed before at sis white scum 69
01:20:09 What is your favorite mud in video games?
01:20:14 What's going on with mud
01:20:16 Do we have any experts here who can answer this question actually wait, um, isn't there a mud track in Mario Kart?
01:20:23 DS yeah, warrior. I believe warrior. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you included the warrior one in the list hippo
01:20:28 But there's another one. That's like chocolatey. It's like a chocolate mountain in Mario Kart. Oh, yeah
01:20:33 That's the isn't that the 64 well
01:20:37 DS one, but I guess I guess it's
01:20:40 Yeah, that's why I didn't put it in I remember a great mud level
01:20:45 There was this game. Uh, there's this game called conquer on the n64 where you run up this whole mountain made out of mud
01:20:52 And then you you know you go inside the mud mountain and you fight like a giant mud man and the mud man throws toilet paper at you
01:20:59 For some reason I never understood why he was throwing toilet paper. His name was the great mighty mud
01:21:03 Yeah, it was a good wholesome game for a young developing boy like myself
01:21:09 It made me the man I am today wholesome and full of values
01:21:12 And that's why you have so much mud in your pants at any given moment
01:21:18 Wait a minute
01:21:21 It was crap
01:21:26 That explains why I'm the crappy pants man
01:21:30 My cannon origin at last
01:21:33 I am actually curious if anybody knows of any other games that have cool mud in them because I couldn't really
01:21:38 I really thought about it when I watched your video and I'm not sure I'm trying
01:21:41 I feel like there's is some game that I played that has mud in it that I just didn't remember like getting on the character and thought
01:21:47 It was gross, but I cannot for the life of me or call what it was
01:21:51 Is there a mud in the Lion King for Super NES?
01:22:01 This is my favorite thing about you Tom that you are the one remaining like Sega warrior champion against Nintendo
01:22:08 Decades later. It's you do my life. You don't understand
01:22:13 Tells the full tale. I tried to buy I bought a Super Nintendo like years later, and I was so offended that it was in my house
01:22:19 I just sold it to my friend. I'm like, I don't want it anymore. Oh, I hate it
01:22:25 Man, man, you know, we should have a PCP about
01:22:29 Arguing and fighting for the sake of it being fun because like when I was like 13
01:22:33 I was all console worry, but like totally as a meme like I was my god, dude. Yes
01:22:37 I was on GameSpot forums all the time lemmings and cows and sheep. Yeah, man
01:22:41 I was like it was like when the Wii was coming out
01:22:44 I was all like, oh dude like this is the future of gaming and like all that online multiplayer shit is just going in the wrong
01:22:49 Direction and like I thought it was fucking funny and then like years later or recently or soon afterwards you get people like guys
01:22:55 What's up with the console war stop being such petty assholes? I'm like you killjoy dumbass. You don't know what this is
01:23:03 Let's let's do it
01:23:04 I want a fucking episode of us talking about fights and how people do it all wrong like people take stuff seriously when it shouldn't be and
01:23:11 People stick to have not serious. I should be because like because like so much fighting on the internet is like someone like see something on Twitter
01:23:18 And they go that's gay then they type like ergue
01:23:21 You're a big asshole head, but then smarmy YouTube people are like look at all these people being so worked up about it
01:23:28 You know like they think that that guy's like all worked up
01:23:30 But he's he just typed a bunch of exclamation marks in his tweet because he thought it was funny, you know
01:23:35 That's it's it's hard to tell when people are serious and a lot of people are just assumed to be serious all the time
01:23:40 That's tough. Yeah, we should educate the people on that. That's a good idea
01:23:43 Um, here's a shit. There was one more that was decent
01:23:52 Filling time filling time get through a sea of not good questions
01:24:00 It was it was here god damn it
01:24:02 Hurry up. I want to get my pizza. I found it. I found it. Okay. Here's our last question
01:24:07 No, you mate
01:24:09 We got to get out at no you mate asks how okay, this one might get real so
01:24:17 How satisfied yeah, how satisfied is each one of you with their work right now? Oh my
01:24:27 I think my work is the best it's been in a while at least in terms of productivity, so I'm pretty good agreed
01:24:36 Uh, all of my work is garbage. It's retarded
01:24:41 Uh weird meta content that appeals to absolutely nobody and has no point and the only good stuff
01:24:46 I make is stuff that I just write and that that never sees the light of day that no one ever gets to see
01:24:51 um my satisfaction with my current output would be um
01:24:57 Like a light eight which is editing digi's videos, right? That's pretty good. My satisfaction with like my workflow
01:25:04 is like
01:25:06 All is like a strong nine and my satisfaction with where I think my work is going like the direction that my output is going
01:25:14 I would say is also like a 9.75. So I'm pretty sad
01:25:19 Fuck you people being happy
01:25:21 Yeah, that's the meme that needs to die if i'm not happy nobody yeah me and tom are going to start our own podcast called the

01:26:09 Those are good. Those are good. It's I'm kind of used to giving myself space to take as long as I want
01:26:14 Can't do it can't do it anymore. It's because you don't like fast food. You go to take inspiration
01:26:18 Oh, I gotta go to burger king first. Yeah, I gotta gotta go back to eating at burger king
