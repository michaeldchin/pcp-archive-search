00:00:00 Welcome to the PCP for all your game and developer needs. Game and for you.
00:00:08 There were bells, do do do do, but I never heard them ring. No, I never heard Elden Ring.
00:00:16 Elden Ring.
00:00:19 Hit the Takamizaki.
00:00:21 Elden Ring, soon it will be Elden Ring.
00:00:28 Oh, let's go then.
00:00:30 Okay, let's go. All right. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:36 Welcome.
00:00:37 The only podcast where we didn't play Elden Ring.
00:00:41 We didn't play it.
00:00:42 Sorry.
00:00:44 No, we're not sorry.
00:00:45 Call this episode cool.
00:00:46 It's cool because it's unusual and mysterious and exotic to have not played Elden Ring.
00:00:53 What if we called this episode Elden Ring and we just talk about Elden Ring as though we'd
00:00:59 played it just based on things that we picked up from the internet and pretend that we know what
00:01:06 we're talking about?
00:01:08 I mean, it would be so easy because Elden Ring is Dark Souls again, but there's a horse and jumping.
00:01:15 It's Dark Souls. Is there jumping? I know it's Dark Souls. It's Breath of the Wild Dark.
00:01:20 Can you climb stuff? Can you climb up walls?
00:01:22 No, no, no. The jumping is like Sekiro jumping. You just sort of go up and down.
00:01:27 I didn't play Sekiro.
00:01:29 I didn't play it either, but I saw it.
00:01:31 But like, I was like, a lot of games come out and it's like, oh, no, no, no, no.
00:01:36 Don't spoil. But like, what the hell could I be spoiled for with Elden Ring?
00:01:42 There's Dour Knights and Sad Castleman, and they're like, this is so bad.
00:01:51 And then you kill them, or you don't, and you get experience points. There's nothing to spoil.
00:01:58 I know exactly what it would be like. It's just a lot of it, you know?
00:02:03 I know that if you hug the lady, you get an HP debuff, but you should do it anyway
00:02:09 because it's the right thing to do or something.
00:02:13 Why'd you get a HP debuff? Is she poisonous?
00:02:16 I think she might. I mean, you know, having expert on the game that I am, I believe she's
00:02:24 like a demon or something. She's some kind of, she's evil, but like, you should do it anyway
00:02:30 because it's like a moment of like human connection in a video game, and you, the player,
00:02:37 are a virgin and you want that. I'm going to roll a Sigma as my class.
00:02:45 It really, it really makes you think about Ludo narrative dissonance.
00:02:56 Yeah, yeah. You have a play, hey, you have a play Ludo.
00:03:00 Is that a card game?
00:03:05 It's, I think it's a game with a popping, like a little dome with a popping like dice in it.
00:03:12 Like trouble?
00:03:13 And you click the thing and it's like, you got your color pieces.
00:03:18 No, I don't know what that is.
00:03:20 I think, I think, wait, I think they might call Ludo trouble in America.
00:03:24 You have little colored green, yellow, whatever. You've got to get them all the way around the
00:03:29 board and the back into your thing. And if somebody lands on your space, you get sent back.
00:03:34 You have to roll a six to get them out of your starting position.
00:03:39 It is, trouble is derivative of the Indian board game Ludo.
00:03:43 Okay.
00:03:44 But is Ludo derivative of that or is it?
00:03:49 This is now the Ludo show.
00:03:52 Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players.
00:03:55 The players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the roles of a single die.
00:04:02 Okay, it's very clearly the same game.
00:04:03 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nelly.
00:04:09 Oh, you're seeing what I'm seeing?
00:04:11 I'm I, are you seeing this far right propaganda?
00:04:15 I haven't had a board like that. I had like a circular one. I guess they changed it.
00:04:21 We have to return to tradition.
00:04:27 God, cancel culture strikes again, cancel culture strikes again.
00:04:30 They took the swastika off my Ludo board.
00:04:34 Wait, where's my Ludo?
00:04:36 Where's my Ludo?
00:04:38 Give me back my Monji.
00:04:40 I want my Monji, bro.
00:04:41 They're all, they're all this like, they're all the symbol, the funny symbol.
00:04:47 Ludo UK, let's see if there's a different one.
00:04:56 No, no, they're all the same.
00:04:57 Oh, whatever.
00:04:58 I could swear there was like a circular one that we went in a spiral instead of like,
00:05:04 like right angles.
00:05:09 Well, never mind.
00:05:12 Yeah, we can no longer play this game because it is all right.
00:05:15 And therefore we will be corrupted and instantly become racist by playing it.
00:05:20 I agree.
00:05:22 That I couldn't have said it better myself.
00:05:26 Trouble is just that, but they put the die in a little bubble that you got to pop
00:05:32 and it flops around.
00:05:34 And I think there's fewer, fewer spaces.
00:05:38 Yeah, yeah.
00:05:40 Man, the whole, man, the whole gimmick of trouble is, is literally just
00:05:45 that the die is in a little bubble that you push.
00:05:48 Okay, I guess I had trouble, but they called it Ludo in the UK.
00:05:54 Whatever, fucking, fucking names of things.
00:05:59 Do you, they call it soccer over here.
00:06:04 They call them, they call them biscuits, you know.
00:06:08 They kick the biscuit bowl in the soccer field.
00:06:12 Do you ever watch, do you ever watch a movie called, oh fuck, was that movie called?
00:06:17 Like pick any movie that I know the name of?
00:06:20 No, there's a, but was one in particular.
00:06:23 It's, fuck, it's based on a comic.
00:06:26 I didn't know it was based on a comic.
00:06:27 Spider-Man.
00:06:29 No, it's about, it's about an author.
00:06:33 It's about a, it's about like a, it's about like the main character is like a struggling author.
00:06:40 Tin tin.
00:06:41 And, and like the bad guy in the movies is like famous author dude and they're, they're in England.
00:06:48 And there's like a romantic triangle and a spoiler.
00:06:54 Like the movie ends when the evil, rich, famous author gets like, I think he gets like crushed
00:07:00 to death by like a stampede of horses.
00:07:06 Fuck, it's called like, um.
00:07:08 Idea of what this is.
00:07:10 It's not Notting Hill.
00:07:11 It's not Bag End.
00:07:13 It's uh, it's the furry movie.
00:07:16 Fuck, movie based on a comic about authors in England.
00:07:24 I bet this will find it.
00:07:27 No, not V for Vendetta.
00:07:29 No, not Sin City.
00:07:33 Jesus fucking Christ.
00:07:35 Um, the, the, the real life exploits of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his real life nemesis,
00:07:42 Moriarty, who's real.
00:07:45 I saw this movie, uh, someone just put it on one time and uh, I watched it and I was like,
00:07:55 that's pretty good, I guess.
00:07:57 Do you remember any of the actors from it?
00:08:00 No, because they were British actors and none of them were like big stars.
00:08:06 Um, I was just surprised because I learned like years later, I saw the comic book version.
00:08:12 It's, it wasn't like a comic book comic.
00:08:14 It was like an indie like graphic novel and it's just not the, not the kind of thing that gets,
00:08:19 not the kind of thing that gets uh, it gets a movie, it gets a movie adaptation.
00:08:24 Yeah, I'm, I'm looking through these Google search because I really just want to say the name.
00:08:30 Uh, I'm going to lose my shit when I, when I find it.
00:08:37 I read this cool, um, graphic novel slash document, uh, like biography of this photographer who
00:08:46 went to like, um, I think it's just called the photographer and it's like half pictures of this
00:08:54 photographer's expedition to Afghanistan.
00:08:58 Oh, Over the Hedge was based on a comic book, that's weird.
00:09:02 Over that, uh, Dreamworks or I think it's Dreamworks.
00:09:08 Um, and it's like, he, he's like a photographer for this expeditionary force of like,
00:09:14 um, medics who go into help people regardless of affiliation.
00:09:20 They just go into like a war-torn country.
00:09:23 I think it was Afghanistan or Syria or something.
00:09:26 The fountain?
00:09:27 What the fuck?
00:09:29 And it's like, it's photographs that he took and then like illustrations of explaining the,
00:09:36 you know, like comic book, like sort of tinting looking.
00:09:38 Really good, really good, cool story.
00:09:41 Real life.
00:09:42 The photographer.
00:09:44 The photographer never heard of that.
00:09:46 Graphic novel.
00:09:47 I recommend that one.
00:09:50 I did, when I was, when I was on my kick of watching, uh, movies about people that just
00:09:58 talk, someone recommended Ghost World, which I did know was based on a comic book by,
00:10:04 not David Klaus, uh, fuck, who's, no, maybe it is by, by David Klaus.
00:10:13 Ghost, I don't know, it's pretty good.
00:10:16 Ghost World, film, uh, Scarlett Johansson, based on, yep, yeah, Daniel Klaus, not David Klaus.
00:10:27 Yes, the guy, same guy who, uh, who, uh, Cheesy gave me that comic book of, which I really liked,
00:10:34 uh, David, David Boring.
00:10:36 David Boring was the name of the book.
00:10:38 Daniel Klaus was the name of the, of the creator.
00:10:41 Um, I am going to perish searching for this, uh, it's, how many, how would you describe what it
00:10:54 looks like?
00:10:56 The comic, the comic book looks like a, it's very like, it sort of has like a very kind of
00:11:06 Euro comic drawing style, sort of like, like Matilda or like a road, road doll book illustration.
00:11:14 And it's, and it's not, it's not in panels.
00:11:16 The pages are text, but with, you know, sort of like illustrations, sort of in little
00:11:22 pockets, you know what I'm saying?
00:11:24 Yeah, yeah.
00:11:25 So it's, it's almost more of an illustrated novel, but it's, it's illustrated enough that
00:11:30 it's basically a graphic novel, not Persepolis, a ghost world, not The Invisibles by Grant
00:11:39 Morrison, not From Hell.
00:11:42 I'm, okay, I'm, I'm looking for, like, I'm looking through art, love and rockets.
00:11:47 Okay, it's, it's this kind of thing.
00:11:50 I'm in like a, a, a, a, I'm on an article, The Rolling Stone.
00:11:54 Oh my god.
00:11:56 Graphic novels made into movies set in England.
00:12:08 I just remembered because there's a line, because the British comics adapted into film,
00:12:12 because they're, they were the, like the shitty douchebag author.
00:12:16 The, the main character is an American guy who's living in England and he like mentions cookies
00:12:21 and the, the douchebag is like, we call them biscuits here.
00:12:26 This guy fucking sucks.
00:12:31 But wait, we have cook, oh, whatever.
00:12:34 Do you have, are they different?
00:12:36 We have cookies, which are the, we call it, like chocolate chip cookies are cookies, but
00:12:43 other types of cookie are, we call them biscuits.
00:12:46 Like the default, like nondescript biscuit is a biscuit.
00:12:50 But when it's got chocolate chips, there are cookies instead.
00:12:54 I'm going to make some two ingredient cookies.
00:13:00 I'm not keto anymore.
00:13:01 I've given up on keto.
00:13:02 I'm just, I'm just low carb and I have, I'm not, I'm just low calorie and I avoid carbs.
00:13:07 I avoid unnecessary carbs.
00:13:09 Oh shit, no, no more keto.
00:13:10 Your, your character traits are, are dwindling.
00:13:13 Yeah, I know.
00:13:14 I have, without all my stupid little affectations, like what, what do I even have left?
00:13:20 Uh, you know, um.
00:13:22 A shell of a man.
00:13:23 Shell of a man.
00:13:24 It's true, sad, but true.
00:13:26 Um, I'm going to make some two ingredient, I'm going to make some two ingredient cookies.
00:13:33 You know what those are?
00:13:35 I assume a thing you put two ingredients in.
00:13:38 They're usually circular.
00:13:40 Do you know what, do you know, do you know what the two ingredients are in the two ingredient cookie?
00:13:46 A flour and egg, I don't know.
00:13:48 No, egg and oats.
00:13:50 No, no, sorry, I'm stupid.
00:13:51 Banana, you mashed up a banana.
00:13:54 Mashed banana and oats.
00:13:57 That sounds pretty good.
00:13:58 Uh, it's okay.
00:13:59 It's a bit, uh, it's not very like, it's a bit, uh, a bit chewy.
00:14:05 You know, it's not very like, it doesn't really taste like a cookie, but like whatever.
00:14:10 Um, and then you, I'm good, but I got, I bought mixins.
00:14:14 I'm going to be a little, I'm going to be a little naughty.
00:14:17 I'm going to be a little naughty.
00:14:18 I'm going to have mixins.
00:14:20 Uh, uh, I got, I got some chocolate.
00:14:23 I got some chocolate and I got some, uh, Reese's cups.
00:14:27 I'm going to chop them up, put them in there, see if that, uh, see what happens.
00:14:35 We'll never know.
00:14:36 I've also, I've also been thinking about making some biscuits.
00:14:39 I kind of want to bake some like really thin, like extremely snap snappy biscuits,
00:14:46 but I don't know of what flavor.
00:14:48 I just want to be able to snap a biscuit.
00:14:50 Cause usually when I bake biscuits, they're too thick.
00:14:53 Are they ginger snaps?
00:14:55 Ginger snaps would be good.
00:14:56 Yeah.
00:14:56 I love ginger, I love ginger snaps.
00:14:59 Ginger snaps with like a very thin layer of dark chocolate on one side.
00:15:04 Now that would be epic.
00:15:09 You know what's not epic is that I can't find the name of this goddamn.
00:15:13 This is going to be like the whole, the whole podcast.
00:15:16 You're going to be Googling.
00:15:17 Wait.
00:15:17 Okay.
00:15:18 Movie where a snooty British author is killed by horses.
00:15:29 Oh, we have a trope for that.
00:15:30 And TV tropes.
00:15:34 Charge of the light brigade?
00:15:35 No.
00:15:38 Why don't you search for that clip?
00:15:39 Like we call them biscuits over here.
00:15:42 Hmm.
00:15:43 We call them biscuits here.
00:15:48 It's called something like, like Notting Hill or like Buckingham Palace or uh,
00:15:54 Oh yeah.
00:15:55 In Australia, they got Anzac Bickeys.
00:15:57 Those sick fucks.
00:16:00 Anzac Bickeys.
00:16:01 Anzac, Anzac Bickeys.
00:16:04 What?
00:16:04 It's just, it's like, it's like, it's a particular type of cookie.
00:16:08 I don't even know what kind it is exactly, but like,
00:16:11 it's named after like, it's named after some,
00:16:15 it's like a military battalion or something.
00:16:17 It's named, it's like named after some shit that happened in some war or another.
00:16:23 I don't know.
00:16:25 I, I, oh, I typed in, we call them biscuits and I got C biscuit, but that would not be
00:16:31 the right clip movie.
00:16:33 I can't do it.
00:16:34 I can't.
00:16:37 This is all I got this week.
00:16:38 This is all I have to talk about this week.
00:16:41 Well, you know what?
00:16:41 While you're thinking about that, I will reiterate.
00:16:45 People play the punk and alley video game.
00:16:48 If you didn't catch it as the last episode, I am making a video game now,
00:16:54 which apparently means I'm copying Ben St. yet again.
00:16:57 Oh yeah.
00:16:58 One comment.
00:16:58 It's like, uh, just doesn't whatever Ben does.
00:17:03 The mouth.
00:17:04 True.
00:17:06 I mean, like making comics.
00:17:08 I think was kind of inspired by you, but I wanted to make a video game since I was like 10.
00:17:15 I mean, Tom was making, I said this in the chat.
00:17:17 Tom was making video games before either of us were.
00:17:20 So I guess I'm just copying Tom.
00:17:23 Yeah.
00:17:24 So I don't know what that guy was thinking about, but very funny.
00:17:28 Yeah.
00:17:28 Fucking it's where there's going to be a, I got it.
00:17:32 I found it.
00:17:33 I found it.
00:17:34 I was wrong.
00:17:34 It's, it's not named a place name.
00:17:37 It's named Tamara Drew.
00:17:39 Tamara Drew is the name of this fucking.
00:17:43 Oh my God.
00:17:43 Like Nancy Drew.
00:17:45 It's not spelled the same way.
00:17:47 Oh my God.
00:17:49 Tamara Drew.
00:17:50 Well, let me find a picture of the comic.
00:17:54 And you'll hear a comedy by Stephen Frears.
00:17:58 Here we go.
00:18:00 You know, you didn't, you didn't specify, but the fact that you talked about authors in England,
00:18:04 I assumed it was Victorian England and not like contemporary.
00:18:09 I mean, maybe in like the seventies, but yeah, it's more, more or less contemporary.
00:18:16 We call them, we call them biscuits here.
00:18:20 You son of a bitch.
00:18:22 And then you fucking yank.
00:18:26 We call them biscuits.
00:18:27 Oh, you call them biscuits, do you?
00:18:29 I'll kill you.
00:18:31 I'll show you.
00:18:32 I'll let my, I'll let these damn horses out of their corrals and stampede you to death.
00:18:38 Yeah, it's like, it's been a while since you've seen the movie.
00:18:42 Is that a young George R.R. Martin in that image?
00:18:44 It looks like it, doesn't it?
00:18:47 But he, I think the, I think the plot of the movie is like the guy is a dick.
00:18:55 The guy's a dick and he sucks.
00:18:57 And then in the end, he's like, he's gonna like, yeah, heck, heck, yeah, I'm gonna do it.
00:19:03 Yeah, I'm gonna cheat on my wife.
00:19:04 Yeah, I'm gonna run away with this, with this interloping younger woman, this Tamara Drew lady
00:19:10 who's got us all, who's got us all, who's thrown our social circles into disarray with her raw
00:19:17 sexual energy.
00:19:18 I'm gonna fucking elope with Tamara Drew.
00:19:20 And then in all that kerfuffle, like some, something happens and a bunch of horses escape
00:19:25 from around the stampede, this guy just killed, he just dies in an accident.
00:19:31 And everyone's like, well, that's funny that that happened because that guy sucked actually.
00:19:36 He didn't like die because he's an asshole, except like, sort of in a very indirect way.
00:19:42 It just so happened that he died in an accident and we're all just like,
00:19:46 shame, but like, fuck that guy.
00:19:48 You know what?
00:19:52 The fact that I remember this movie like a decade later should tell you that it was great.
00:19:59 I never read the comic.
00:20:00 I never read the comic though, yeah.
00:20:02 Comic looks pretty good.
00:20:05 It's got a some, what, what do you call it, quality?
00:20:10 Like it's realistic, but like, not too, they're not worrying too hard about everything.
00:20:17 It's put it together well, but like, you know, literally trying to be realistic is nice.
00:20:22 Now this is a movie that's just about people talking to each other about stuff.
00:20:27 Now, here's a, now here's a film like that, if ever there was one.
00:20:37 Did I ever talk about, did I ever talk about Locke,
00:20:39 ever talk about the movie Locke on here?
00:20:43 With an E.
00:20:44 Yeah, with an E.
00:20:45 I don't think you have.
00:20:48 It's the one where the entire movie takes place in the guy's car while he's on a drive on the highway.
00:20:55 I don't know that.
00:20:56 Oh, that movie rules.
00:20:58 Okay, well, if I didn't tell you about it before,
00:21:01 yeah, it's what I just said.
00:21:03 The whole movie is just set like, in this guy's car and he's just taking calls and making calls
00:21:11 and he's on his way.
00:21:14 I don't think it's a spoiler to say that he's on his way to see his son be born.
00:21:19 He's about to have a son born and like, he's getting calls from his wife,
00:21:27 who is not the mother of the child.
00:21:30 So he's got to like break the news to her and he's got to like talk to his kids because he was like,
00:21:34 because he was like supposed to be like watching the big game with them.
00:21:39 And he's got to like call this woman who he had like a one night stand with and he's got to like
00:21:44 talk to her on the phone and be like, yeah, I'm on my way.
00:21:50 Want to see that son be born and whatever.
00:21:53 He's got to talk to like the doctors.
00:21:55 And then also at the same time, there's like, he's like a construction contractor
00:22:03 and he's got like a build like, like this building is about to be started.
00:22:09 The construction is about to be started.
00:22:11 They're about to do a pour.
00:22:13 They're going to do a big pour, which means they're going to lay down like the concrete
00:22:16 foundation for this building.
00:22:17 It's going to be like the highlight of his career.
00:22:20 But he gets like fired over the whole thing.
00:22:23 He gets fired, but the poor is still on.
00:22:25 So he's got to like be talking on the phone to his like assistant guy who's like drunk.
00:22:31 He like got drunk and he's like, oh God, like it's all, it's all going to go,
00:22:34 it's all going to go pear shaped unless you can, unless you can reach like some guys I know and
00:22:39 they can like, and they can sort like the details out before it happens or else it's all canceled
00:22:44 and my life's work goes up in smoke.
00:22:46 So he's, he's just in his car, just making all these phone calls about all this shit that's
00:22:50 happening.
00:22:51 Is he like stuck in traffic?
00:22:54 No, he's just driving.
00:22:56 He's, he's just driving, but it's all, it's all very like time sensitive.
00:23:00 It's all like, this has to get sorted out tonight because like the poor is happening
00:23:04 in the morning and like, you know, it's very tense.
00:23:09 The stakes, the stakes are well established.
00:23:13 It do be like that.
00:23:14 And that is, I don't, feels, feels like, I mean, I'm sure it's a fun movie, but I can't
00:23:23 help but feel like, like I would remind me of all this shit that's going on in my life,
00:23:29 even though it's not nearly as like intense as that.
00:23:31 And I'd be like, Oh no, more than two things are happening.
00:23:34 Oh geez.
00:23:35 Oh God.
00:23:37 Can't deal.
00:23:38 Well, yeah.
00:23:39 I mean, I guess so.
00:23:41 But like, it's fun when it's someone else.
00:23:46 That's, I kind of want to watch that.
00:23:48 It sounds like a fun.
00:23:51 I really like it a lot.
00:23:52 Like a, I guess sort of a challenge to make it engaging visually, even though it's,
00:24:00 yeah, it's just a car, guy in a car.
00:24:03 Well, have you ever, have you ever seen, have you ever seen my dinner with Andre?
00:24:07 Nope.
00:24:08 That's another one.
00:24:09 It's just two guys sitting at a table talking about stuff.
00:24:13 And it's just the stuff they're talking about is interesting enough.
00:24:17 Is that feature length?
00:24:19 Yeah.
00:24:19 Yeah.
00:24:20 Dang.
00:24:21 Uh, they have stars.
00:24:23 Scenes set in like, like a tool, like shown any other place or is it just that one set?
00:24:30 Well, while the beginning is like, it's the guy who plays the Sicilian in The Princess Bride.
00:24:38 You know who I'm talking about?
00:24:39 Nope.
00:24:40 I've never seen a film.
00:24:42 You've never seen The Princess Bride?
00:24:45 No.
00:24:46 Damn.
00:24:47 Okay.
00:24:48 Well, he was also the teacher in Clueless.
00:24:51 Never seen that.
00:24:53 Oh God.
00:24:54 He was also, um, oh, he's in a bun.
00:24:58 He's in a lot of movies.
00:24:59 You'd probably recognize him.
00:25:00 Okay, whatever.
00:25:01 Anyway, I forget his name, though.
00:25:04 But it's that guy, like the beginning is him like walking to the restaurant to meet Andre,
00:25:09 to have the titular dinner with Andre.
00:25:12 And then the movie is just them at the table talking about stuff and Andre telling all this
00:25:17 weird shit that he did for the past like 10 years.
00:25:21 Oh, it's this guy.
00:25:24 Is he in the guy in that film with the guy who says, you don't know what you think it means,
00:25:32 the word, you killed my father, you know?
00:25:35 Yeah, that's Princess Bride, you fuck.
00:25:37 Oh, I haven't seen it.
00:25:39 I just know that clip.
00:25:41 That's the guy, you know, one of the two rules of engagement.
00:25:48 Never get involved in a land war in Asia and never go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line.
00:25:55 He-man.
00:25:58 Yeah, that's, uh, that's him.
00:26:01 William Sean on Andre Gregory.
00:26:03 Classic line.
00:26:07 Is Andrew Gregory that guy?
00:26:10 I remember he's in...
00:26:11 That's the other guy.
00:26:11 It's, um, I...
00:26:14 Sean?
00:26:15 Something Sean?
00:26:15 Wallace Sean.
00:26:17 Wallace Sean.
00:26:17 That sounds familiar.
00:26:18 He's in some movie, and I forget what movie it is, but I remember he plays a, uh, like a casino,
00:26:25 like Blackjack dealer or something.
00:26:28 And it might be like one of, it might be like one of the vacation movies,
00:26:33 like Chevy Chase in Vacation maybe.
00:26:35 And he says like, like, the main character loses all his money.
00:26:39 He's got like one chip left, and he asks, and he asks Wallace Sean, the black, the dealer,
00:26:46 like, how much, how, what can I do with one chip?
00:26:49 I've got one chip left, and he says, oh, I don't know.
00:26:51 Buy a bullet and rent a gun.
00:26:56 Oh, whoa.
00:26:56 I, I went to his, I love that line.
00:26:58 I went to his IMDb, known for the Princess Bride, my dinner with Andre.
00:27:01 The Incredibles.
00:27:03 He was the voice of, of, uh...
00:27:05 Syndrome?
00:27:06 No, Robert Parr's boss, like, I'm not happy, Bob.
00:27:10 Oh, the little, the little shorty.
00:27:10 Not happy.
00:27:11 Yeah, like that guy.
00:27:12 Oh, wow, okay.
00:27:13 And also, he did the voice of Rex in Toy Story.
00:27:17 Yes, I knew that.
00:27:18 I knew that.
00:27:19 Yep, that's him.
00:27:20 And also Young Sheldon, something, something, I'm scrolling through.
00:27:24 Is he, is he, is he in Young Sheldon?
00:27:27 Or is he the narration?
00:27:28 He's done so much.
00:27:29 Two hundred starting credits.
00:27:31 Yeah, he's in a lot of stuff.
00:27:32 Wait, what does he do in Young Sheldon?
00:27:35 Dr. John Sturgis?
00:27:37 Oh, he's just, oh, he's just some guy.
00:27:39 Oh, he's old now.
00:27:40 Oh, shit.
00:27:40 I hate when actors get old.
00:27:42 Yeah, it's funny.
00:27:43 You, you Google it and think, oh, I've seen it in that movie.
00:27:46 And then it like, close to death, like skeleton face, like, oh no.
00:27:50 Time passes.
00:27:51 Yeah.
00:27:52 Yeah.
00:27:53 I mean, he's, I was, I mean, he's, he's kind of always looked old.
00:27:59 But now he looks really old.
00:28:01 He's not like, he's not like, like, who's the guy who plays, what's the name
00:28:07 of the Star Trek Enterprise?
00:28:10 Um, Picard?
00:28:11 Picard.
00:28:12 Fuck, what's that actress name?
00:28:16 Oh, uh, the Patrick Stewart.
00:28:20 I knew it.
00:28:20 Yeah, Patrick Stewart is, it was the example, everyone.
00:28:23 Patrick Stewart and, uh, uh, the guy who was, uh, uh, James Bond and Indiana Jones'
00:28:31 dad, uh, Patrick Stewart.
00:28:34 No.
00:28:34 No.
00:28:37 Fuck, I know this.
00:28:38 He looks like Alec Guinness, but he's got a Sean Connery.
00:28:42 Sean Connery.
00:28:43 Yes.
00:28:43 Those are the two everyone says, uh, they just like, they've always looked old and
00:28:47 they've just continued to look old in the same way until now.
00:28:52 Although now Patrick Stewart is getting all squinty.
00:28:55 And now that he's like fucking 90, uh, damn.
00:28:59 I hate it when people get old and die.
00:29:01 Lemau.
00:29:02 That sucks.
00:29:03 Well, it's better than getting young and dying.
00:29:06 That's true.
00:29:07 That's true.
00:29:07 Wallace Sean is looking, uh, no, he's.
00:29:11 He's looking all right.
00:29:12 It was just sort of like, uh, I didn't know what he, I didn't know what he looked like.
00:29:15 And then it's like the most recent photo when you type in his name.
00:29:18 It's like, oh, yeah.
00:29:22 I mean, he's, he's visibly, he's, he's visibly much older.
00:29:25 So he's not, he didn't stop aging like those two did.
00:29:30 Fucking.
00:29:31 But that's okay.
00:29:32 Uh, marriage story.
00:29:34 Wait, marriage story was a good film, wasn't it?
00:29:37 I didn't, I didn't see that one.
00:29:38 This is the, the, when, when Kylo Ren gets married to, to Black Widow.
00:29:44 Oh, just like in, just like in Ghost World, it's got, right?
00:29:46 Scarlett Johansson is the lady, right?
00:29:49 I think so.
00:29:51 I saw Scarlett Johansson is the girl in, uh, she's the friend, the blonde friend, I think in, uh,
00:30:00 in Ghost World, it's, yeah, Scarlett Johansson is the blonde friend, and the main character is,
00:30:05 I forget her name, but she was also the girl in, uh, American Beauty.
00:30:12 Um, and then also, also, um, I don't know, that one's got, uh, the guy, that one's got the hello,
00:30:19 how do you do a fellow kids guy in it?
00:30:21 Oh, um, I don't know, that one's got the guy, that one's got the hello, how do you do a fellow
00:30:28 Oh, um, I, uh, Steve Buscemi.
00:30:33 Steve Buscemi, yes, there we go.
00:30:36 This is fun trying to remember who the fuck these people are.
00:30:39 I'm, wait, I was gonna, there'll be a video game about this, our, our normal game.
00:30:46 What's, what do you call it when it's like a video game, but it's not on a television?
00:30:50 Uh, oh, shit, what's the word?
00:30:52 Uh, that is pastime, uh, uh, the, the Ludo something?
00:30:56 Oh Ludo, that's how we got on all of this.
00:31:00 Um, I was gonna make another connection to something else that was in something else that
00:31:06 some, someone was in and degrees of Kevin Bacon.
00:31:12 Uh, was I going somewhere?
00:31:15 I just want to do, I just want to remember the name Tamara Drew.
00:31:18 Yeah, I think it was because of the guy we were talking about Britishisms.
00:31:23 We call them biscuits over here.
00:31:25 I'm going to see, I feel like maybe the guy who played the douchebag.
00:31:32 No, he's not that famous.
00:31:34 He's, he's an actor named Roger Allam.
00:31:36 So no, not, not someone I've heard of.
00:31:40 Yeah, I don't, they didn't get, you know, this was not a high budget movie.
00:31:43 They didn't have a, they didn't, they didn't have A-listers, but that's okay.
00:31:48 I like it when a movie doesn't have A-listers.
00:31:51 If I see an A-lister, I'm like.
00:31:54 Gay-lister.
00:31:55 Takes me up, more like, yeah, more like gay-lister.
00:31:59 It takes me out of the movie.
00:32:01 Uh, it's pretty rare.
00:32:02 It's pretty rare for, for there to be an A-lister and for me to, you know.
00:32:05 I think it's.
00:32:06 Not just, not just see him as the actor, you know.
00:32:09 Sure.
00:32:09 I mean, that's for some actors.
00:32:13 Yeah.
00:32:13 Like when you've seen Orlando Bloom before, every time you see Orlando Bloom again,
00:32:20 you're like, oh, it's Legolas.
00:32:23 Oh, it's that guy.
00:32:24 I feel like.
00:32:25 Or it's like Bill Will Turner or whatever.
00:32:28 Like the, or like Leonardo DiCaprio.
00:32:31 Oh, it's Leo.
00:32:32 You don't see the, you don't see the character he's playing.
00:32:35 But some, some actors that are prolific and like A-list, like Gary Oldman always feels
00:32:40 like whatever character he is.
00:32:41 Yeah.
00:32:43 Yeah.
00:32:44 Uh, I mean, Gary Oldman, I get, now I guess he's an A-lister.
00:32:51 Yeah.
00:32:53 Uh, I mean, I guess if you're a good actor, I don't know what I think.
00:32:57 Yeah.
00:32:58 But I think more, yeah, true.
00:33:00 But I think more, you can, you can do it.
00:33:02 You can do it.
00:33:02 But I think more movies, I wish that more movies and higher budget movies just hired
00:33:08 actors that nobody had ever fucking seen before.
00:33:10 I think that would be cool.
00:33:11 Yes.
00:33:13 Although I don't watch movies, so I don't really have a stake in this at all.
00:33:17 I guess that's, I guess I don't watch a lot of movies.
00:33:20 Well, I was watching movies for a little bit there.
00:33:22 Maybe, maybe one of these days I'll watch a bunch more movies.
00:33:24 No, you know what I think I want to do is a, I made a little note on my to-do list.
00:33:30 I kind of want to go to the library.
00:33:33 I kind of want to go to the library and get some books, some actual physical books for
00:33:38 pages.
00:33:38 You've talked about this already.
00:33:39 Have you?
00:33:39 Have I talked about this?
00:33:40 Have you still not gone?
00:33:42 Well, no, I'm doing, I'm doing.
00:33:46 You got to study up for the biggest exam.
00:33:49 I'm, I'm in doing a slime and punishment.
00:33:53 Oh, of course.
00:33:53 Speaking, speaking of which, I, I'm like, I'm basically, I'm on like the last one page of
00:34:04 the, I said this before, I'm, there's the game, I had to do the page leading up to the game.
00:34:10 Those are done.
00:34:11 Then there's the game.
00:34:13 Then there's the post game scene, which is basically the end.
00:34:19 And that is basically done.
00:34:20 It's, it's not quite done, but it's, it's all, it's like so close to being done.
00:34:24 And then I have an ending, which I don't know what it's going to be, but I think I'm starting,
00:34:30 I've had some ideas.
00:34:30 I have some ideas for that.
00:34:33 And I don't want that to take a long time.
00:34:36 I think I'm dragging my feet.
00:34:38 I think I'm suffering from a psychological malady that I have suffered from in the past,
00:34:45 where when something gets really close to being done,
00:34:49 I, I like resist doing it.
00:34:53 You resist like the actual finishing of it, or like you're, you're, you're adding things
00:35:00 or you're changing things and tweaking shit.
00:35:02 No, that's, that's different.
00:35:04 I mean, like I just don't want to, I just don't want to do it.
00:35:08 I don't want to do it because finishing something you've been working on for a long time is,
00:35:16 uh, well, uh, uh, releasing it is like change.
00:35:22 It's like a change, it's like a change of state in your life.
00:35:24 And that's scary.
00:35:26 Yeah.
00:35:27 You transition from I'm working on this thing to, oh, that thing's done.
00:35:31 That thing's over.
00:35:32 Yeah.
00:35:33 You kind of need to, I think it's like, you've got into a rhythm with a project that you work
00:35:39 on for a long time and then you don't want to disrupt your daily, um, you know,
00:35:45 your workflow, the things you do every day.
00:35:48 Um, so sort of unconsciously, you just want to keep it the same.
00:35:53 And so having it to do was part of your, your, what you were thinking about.
00:35:59 And then, and all, but it's weird because like there's things I want to do.
00:36:03 I feel the same way sometimes, but like there's like things I want to do.
00:36:07 And I'm like, okay, well, I got to do this thing first before I can do that thing.
00:36:11 And I just don't make the jump.
00:36:16 It's, yeah.
00:36:17 Uh, I mean, yeah, obviously, obviously finishing it is, um, it's good.
00:36:22 The most, the most reasonable thing to do.
00:36:24 It's a bit, it's a bit of like resistance because like, oh, scared of, scared of change,
00:36:30 right?
00:36:31 Obviously.
00:36:31 And then also like nervous, like, oh, what if it's a flop?
00:36:35 What if everyone hates it?
00:36:36 What if like it sucks?
00:36:37 What if, uh, you know, the reception is not good?
00:36:41 Uh, maybe I just shouldn't release it.
00:36:42 Uh, maybe I just shouldn't finish it.
00:36:43 Uh, never mind.
00:36:47 That and also the effect of, um, you know, uh, the like, oh, if you, if you talk about a thing,
00:36:55 it feels like you already did it.
00:36:56 Yeah.
00:36:58 I have a bit of that because like the game is, the game's done and it's been done.
00:37:02 And I've, you know, I've, I've given it to my patrons.
00:37:06 My patrons have played it.
00:37:07 So a bit, I have a bit of the like, oh, I kind of already finished it.
00:37:11 I kind of already showed it to people.
00:37:12 Uh, you know, I know it's, uh, I know it's not, uh, true exactly, but it kind of feels that way.
00:37:22 So I don't know.
00:37:23 For a bunch of reasons this week, uh, I think I've dragged my feet a little.
00:37:28 I haven't really been dragging my feet.
00:37:30 Like I got like, uh, I got like 13 more, uh, like pages done, which is not nothing,
00:37:38 but I feel like I could have finished it this week, uh, but I didn't.
00:37:43 So yeah, I mean, I, I feel like that sometimes a lot of the time.
00:37:47 I mean, yeah, I, I finally, I haven't like made an announcement of this,
00:37:51 but I finally finished those ghost costumes.
00:37:54 They're all done.
00:37:55 They're all, they're all done.
00:37:56 I saw you, uh, yeah, all 34 of them.
00:38:00 And, uh, next step is to look through the Kickstarter things and get all the addresses
00:38:07 and ship off a bunch of other packages.
00:38:11 And I'm like, but for a while there, getting the ghost costume stone was like,
00:38:15 okay, I've got to do this.
00:38:17 And I did like, I was doing them consistently.
00:38:20 And then one day I was just like, uh, I, uh, I did three instead of 10, which I did the day before.
00:38:27 Hmm.
00:38:28 Sometimes you just don't do anything.
00:38:32 I mean, heck, if you did three a day, that would take what 12 days to get them all done.
00:38:38 Yeah.
00:38:38 Whatever, whatever.
00:38:39 It took me more like a week, which is pretty good, but it's like, I, I, I,
00:38:43 since I did 10 in one day, I really felt it when I couldn't do 10 in another day.
00:38:51 And I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with me that I should have done this
00:38:56 in November?
00:38:57 I should have done this while I was waiting for other things.
00:39:00 But like, there are, my, my mind was like consumed by the, the pumpkin alley game demo.
00:39:06 So like, I have excuses, but it still feels like lots of things could have been done earlier.
00:39:11 If only I was working better.
00:39:14 There are, there are days, I've said this before, there are days, uh, working on slime and punishment
00:39:19 where I get like eight, eight pages done in one day.
00:39:23 And there are some, and there are some pages that take me eight days to get done.
00:39:29 The ones that I just, the latest ones that I posted on Twitter as of this recording,
00:39:34 the ones with, uh, Phantom, uh, Meeting Keg at the, at the Clover Cafe in Ponyville.
00:39:42 Uh, those ones took me forever.
00:39:45 Not because, not because they're like super complicated or anything.
00:39:49 It's not that.
00:39:50 It's like, you know, did I stop me if I said this before, but it's, it's not that, uh,
00:39:57 it's not that they were complicated.
00:39:59 The reason they took me a long time is just because I had a very specific vision for them.
00:40:04 And I just had to be, I was just very fussy about they have to be positioned like this.
00:40:10 He has to look like this.
00:40:12 And just because I had to get it right and I had a very specific idea, it took me a long time
00:40:18 versus other pages where I just kind of have a general idea of the gist of what it's meant to
00:40:23 get across.
00:40:24 And I can just kind of draw whatever.
00:40:27 And if it's like close enough, I'm like, okay, that's good enough.
00:40:29 That's fine.
00:40:31 I don't have to like redraw and redraw or anything.
00:40:35 Whereas like with those, I had to like redraw.
00:40:37 I like, I kept having to redraw Keg's like position and like this is his gesture in his
00:40:43 face and just like get it just because I want to communicate a very,
00:40:48 I don't want to communicate, you know, if the face is off, then like the whole scene is weird.
00:40:53 I mean, I mean, the whole scene is weird, but it's supposed to be weird in a specific way.
00:41:00 Yeah, that's, uh, that's it.
00:41:03 Anyway, I tweeted this week, I tweeted this week that, um,
00:41:10 or was it last week?
00:41:14 No, it was, it was, it was this week.
00:41:17 I tweeted, if you, if people end up not liking the ending of slime and punishment,
00:41:22 remember, I, it's that, it's my, my heart told me to write, I followed my heart.
00:41:26 It's, I didn't do it.
00:41:27 It's not my fault.
00:41:29 If the ending, if you hate the ending, uh, it's my heart's fault.
00:41:34 I didn't have a choice.
00:41:36 My, I've been drawing the ending and it's, I, I've talked about this before.
00:41:41 It's deeply uncomfortable.
00:41:42 The final scene makes me, makes me uncomfortable, uh, to look at it and think about it, but it's okay.
00:41:50 It's good because it's my vision and I can't, and it doesn't matter if I don't like it.
00:41:54 It's not about what I want.
00:41:57 I, I, I genuinely feel, I was thinking about this.
00:42:00 I feel like writing slime and punishment was not, I was not like thinking of ideas.
00:42:06 I didn't like have ideas.
00:42:08 Well, that's not true.
00:42:09 Occasionally I would have an idea, but it was more like I just had to discover it.
00:42:18 I would suddenly realize, oh, of course, that's how it must be.
00:42:22 Yes, yes, I see.
00:42:23 Yes, of course, it was always this way.
00:42:26 Uh, now I just, I had just forgotten,
00:42:29 but now I remember that this is how it has to go.
00:42:33 That's how it feels sometimes.
00:42:35 Um, yeah.
00:42:38 I hope the twist is that ultimate pumpkin comes back and kills phantom horn randomly.
00:42:43 Ultimate, ultimate, you know, I was thinking about ultimate pumpkin.
00:42:46 I, I will spoil that, uh, ultimate pumpkin does not, does not make an appear, I'm sorry.
00:42:53 That's, I wish he did because I was thinking about ultimate pumpkin because when phantom is
00:42:57 walking through, uh, Ponyville, I remembered, you know, lol, all those other, all those joke
00:43:02 characters we made up on T-Bap, like horse fister and ultimate pumpkin and silver spoon,
00:43:07 or not silver spoon, uh, silver lining, silver lining.
00:43:10 Yeah.
00:43:11 Uh, I fondly remembered those guys, but, uh, I was like, well, I mean, there's really no,
00:43:17 there's really no need for them anywhere in this story.
00:43:20 Not even in the background.
00:43:22 Didn't they have like visuals?
00:43:24 You know what they look like?
00:43:25 I feel, I feel like, um, yeah, they could have been in the background.
00:43:31 Yeah, they could have been, but they weren't.
00:43:38 The, I do, I actually think that like phantom has gone on a journey and he has basically become
00:43:48 a super powered like monster and, uh, I kind of think that now him and him and ultimate pumpkin
00:43:56 might have, they would have, they would have, uh, maybe, maybe they would, I'm not sure if
00:44:01 they would have fine common ground to discuss or if they would come to, to blows and battle each other.
00:44:08 I'm not sure something would happen.
00:44:09 Ultimate pumpkin clearly is like a hero.
00:44:14 Yes.
00:44:15 So he would stop you if you went too far.
00:44:17 Oh, I mean, phantom.
00:44:18 Yes, if phantom went too far, perhaps.
00:44:21 Yeah, uh, I don't, I mean, I don't think phantom would phantom did, you know,
00:44:26 cause a, a bit of a public disturbance and lights and buildings on fire, but he didn't do it on purpose.
00:44:33 You know, he's, his, his heart's in the right place.
00:44:36 Unlike mine, which tells me to draw the deeply uncomfortable scene that the comic ends with.
00:44:43 Okay, I, I haven't reread all the slime and punishment,
00:44:47 but so I'm just going to summarize the, the comic and you tell me if I got anything terribly wrong.
00:44:54 So phantom horn and strawberry milk are looking at, uh, Pony version of Chris Chan star night star
00:45:05 night star.
00:45:06 She throws them through a portal to endless war and you know, lack of calm.
00:45:11 That's right.
00:45:12 They learn about slime.
00:45:13 They do all that.
00:45:14 Yes.
00:45:16 Then they love, they learn to love slime.
00:45:19 They learn to love slime.
00:45:20 They're in the slime.
00:45:21 They learn about capitalism and how when you got, when you got, and how when you got slime, it just works.
00:45:28 They go into the, the sewers and they learn about the, they learn about, they learn about death
00:45:34 and how actually with slime death is cool.
00:45:37 And so is communism, but also capitalism just works and the free market.
00:45:42 Is the most efficient way of distributing slime.
00:45:46 Okay.
00:45:46 So they learn all about that and they're in there.
00:45:48 And then I forget what happens.
00:45:50 Some sort of like multiple dimensional stuff happens.
00:45:54 Then it's, then there's a bubble and it goes flip and it goes, whoa.
00:45:57 And then, then I, I don't know what's going on.
00:46:01 I can't remember.
00:46:02 The mult, the multiple dimensional stuff is that, um, Chris Chan, Sonichu shows up.
00:46:09 They, they, they learn to love slime and they become productive gangsters, citizens.
00:46:14 And then Chris Chan, Sonichu shows up, uh, just because, because Chris said so.
00:46:22 And, and then she gets a slime sample and takes it to Nightstar and then off screen.
00:46:30 This is not seen.
00:46:31 It's, it's discovered later.
00:46:32 They develop the, the antidote for slime.
00:46:36 Bicarbonate rain.
00:46:38 Yes.
00:46:38 The bicarbonate sugar, soda water.
00:46:40 And then they bring the storm comes and then, uh, uh, that has multi-dimensional
00:46:47 consequences that destroys a lot of timelines or destroys the city in a lot of timelines.
00:46:54 And then, uh, they all have to reassemble back in the beta timeline.
00:46:59 And then S revert is moving the city from the beta timeline back to the alpha timeline
00:47:06 to resume operations as normal.
00:47:09 Uh, and then, and that's basically it.
00:47:14 That's, that was the end of the comic until recently.
00:47:17 And then the new, the new updates are.
00:47:20 And then Phantom's revenge is like, dang it, I'm going to kill you, uh, the Phantom Horn story.
00:47:26 Yes.
00:47:27 Everyone is, uh, uh, Nalakakam and Quickville are now at war, but it's hardly a war because
00:47:33 Quickville was no match.
00:47:35 And it's basically, we're just, we're just mopping up all the survivors at this point.
00:47:40 Uh, Chris Chan Sonichu was of course crushed underneath the city as it fell back into place
00:47:47 on the coast of the Grand Canyon and filled it with slime, obviously.
00:47:52 Uh, so they're leaderless.
00:47:54 They're like a head, a chicken without a head, just running around.
00:47:58 They're like, uh, they're like the, they're like the drone army in Star Wars.
00:48:02 When the head drone droid is, uh, is killed, they just, they can't, they don't have, uh,
00:48:09 they're fucked.
00:48:10 They're all fucked.
00:48:11 Um, uh, yes, but, but that's all kind of in the background.
00:48:16 Phantom has to go and settle his own score, uh, with, he's got to find
00:48:21 Nightstar and make her pay.
00:48:23 Make her pay for throwing them into Endless War or, or, or, or like killing the slime.
00:48:32 No, he, he was mad.
00:48:35 He was initially mad about her throwing him through the portal into Nlakakam.
00:48:40 And it was a pretty evil thing to do, but then he learned to love slime.
00:48:44 So he's not mad about that anymore.
00:48:46 No, he's mad that she was, he's, he's, uh, he's mad that she was complicit in the, uh,
00:48:51 in the slime, in the Soda Rain Holocaust.
00:48:54 Right.
00:48:56 Right.
00:48:57 She, she developed the antidote and she, and she must pay for her, for her war crimes.
00:49:03 I see.
00:49:04 And that's, and that, and that's the story.
00:49:06 That's the story.
00:49:09 It's, it's, you know, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a classic tale.
00:49:13 It's a hero's journey where he wants, what he initially wants is to go home to Ponyville.
00:49:20 But then in the end, he discovers that what he needs is just to learn to love slime.
00:49:26 Yes.
00:49:28 Uh, he's, he's, he's, he has a, he has a character arc.
00:49:31 He's in his Ponyville and he's just like, I don't have a horn and that's me.
00:49:35 That's Phantom Horn.
00:49:36 This sucks.
00:49:37 Makes me, I wish I was a unicorn, but you know, I am kind of, but it's not real.
00:49:42 That sucks.
00:49:43 And then at a chance encounter, he, he falls into a slime world and he just loves it.
00:49:52 And then it's taken away and so he has to fight to get it back.
00:49:56 Or the, yeah, I guess he fights, they all fight to get it back.
00:50:00 Uh, yeah, he, um, uh, well, he, I mean, he doesn't really, I mean,
00:50:08 it's like all those other characters, like, uh, the Jane Crocker with a gun and, and, and
00:50:15 the little crack and Jane Crocker with a gun and whoop, whoopity, whoopity.
00:50:20 Yeah.
00:50:20 God, what the fuck?
00:50:22 So many characters that are not like terribly explained in the comic that are like happening
00:50:28 in the, we're happening in the discord over like months.
00:50:34 Yeah.
00:50:35 A lot of, a lot of it is base.
00:50:37 A lot of it is like, um, Killer Sonichu.
00:50:42 Killer Sonichu is just Jane Crocker with a gun who had stolen the Sonichu medallion
00:50:48 from the beta timeline version of Chris Chan, who it, who became corrupted by slime,
00:50:57 quote unquote, corrupted, uh, who was, that was a player named Cabricon.
00:51:03 That was just their like alt.
00:51:04 Yeah.
00:51:05 That was their killer alt because they were a rowdy normally.
00:51:10 Yeah.
00:51:10 And they drew Killer Sonichu and I was like, yeah, I'm using this.
00:51:14 I have not seen them around, uh, but, uh, I don't know.
00:51:19 Maybe they were a good artist.
00:51:20 So they were a good artist.
00:51:22 So I hope they are still drawing.
00:51:24 Yeah.
00:51:26 Uh, a lot of really good, a lot of really good artists, uh, from the old, from the,
00:51:30 in the old guard of, uh, of the endless war crowd.
00:51:34 The endless war peep, the endless war people has changed.
00:51:39 There's a new, there was the old guard and there's the new guard and the new guard has
00:51:43 stayed kind of consistent for the last like year plus maybe, maybe even two years,
00:51:49 but there's, there was definitely a like an old crowd and there's a new crowd
00:51:54 and there's some crossover between them.
00:51:57 Uh, yeah, I don't know.
00:52:00 That's, I don't know.
00:52:01 I'm not, I don't have any further point to make about that other than that.
00:52:05 It's true.
00:52:06 I, I remember Uwupiti, right?
00:52:09 It was like the little mascot you made during your Vapors Kickstarter.
00:52:15 Okay, Uwupiti.
00:52:18 Got, wait, I'm trying to think where did Uwupiti originate?
00:52:22 We called it Uwupiti not because he was like Dupiti,
00:52:27 but that was just like a funny name to give.
00:52:30 Uh, Uwupiti's pronouns are it, it's, uh, thank you very much.
00:52:34 Oh, sorry.
00:52:35 Uh, yeah, I decided that all, all Slymoids default to it.
00:52:40 They don't default to it, to it's unless, unless they, unless specified otherwise.
00:52:46 And their, uh, their honorific is not, uh, Mr or Mrs, but it's a, it's Mx and it's pronounced
00:52:53 mixture as in like, I think that's pretty, I think that's pretty clever because they're like,
00:53:00 because they're like mixed up in a big VAT, you know, they, they come out of the slime
00:53:03 Corp of Vats.
00:53:04 I thought I was pretty proud of myself when I came up with that.
00:53:07 Um, uh, mixed, mixture Uwupiti is, uh, what was I saying?
00:53:12 Okay, I, I made, I made Uwupiti up.
00:53:17 It didn't have a name originally.
00:53:19 I keep wanting to call him a he, lol, but now I can't or I'll sound like an
00:53:23 asshole.
00:53:24 Uh, uh, uh, I came up with Uwupiti.
00:53:27 The idea, I was going to guilt Chris.
00:53:29 I think I wanted to guilt Chris into like retweeting.
00:53:33 Oh, I wanted to guilt Chris into retweeting the vapor suit kickstart.
00:53:38 So I made this like adorable little, little slime creature like, oh, the slime, the slime
00:53:44 Wayne killed my whole family.
00:53:46 The slime Wayne.
00:53:47 Oh, that's right.
00:53:48 That was happening.
00:53:50 The slime Wayne, uh, displaced my community.
00:53:53 Ooh, uh, oh, if only Christian would retweet the vapors to kickstart.
00:54:00 And she never did.
00:54:02 And I was like, oh, he's like Uwupiti.
00:54:05 She, it had to, uh, was like, oh, if Chris doesn't, doesn't retweet the kickstarter,
00:54:11 I'm going to kill myself and throwing myself into this vat of acid.
00:54:15 Oh, she didn't retweet.
00:54:17 Oh, I guess, uh, what's the point of
00:54:19 going on?
00:54:20 That's right.
00:54:20 Okay.
00:54:21 So I was, I remembered that during that I made a tweet where I had like Katie, my slime girl,
00:54:29 save Uwupiti and put him in a jar.
00:54:31 And that's why they're in a jar later.
00:54:35 Yes.
00:54:35 And also, I forgot it was Katie, but yes, I remember that.
00:54:39 Yes.
00:54:40 Later on, uh, in the alternate, in a killer, killer sonichu gives killer sonichu gives
00:54:49 phantom horn.
00:54:50 And this is the surviving phantom horn from an alternate beta timeline, uh, gives phantom horn
00:54:58 the all the alpha timeline version of Virginia, uh, whose owner was killed.
00:55:04 That's the main phantom horn.
00:55:06 The story follows was killed by the rain.
00:55:08 But his, his Virginia gets given to the alternate phantom, as well as Uwupiti, who is in a bottle
00:55:15 along with a bunch of piss, a bunch of, a bunch of slime court piss vats, uh, is just in there.
00:55:23 I forgot that.
00:55:24 And also, uh, Tom made that, that animation.
00:55:28 Do you remember that?
00:55:29 Of that, that 3D animation of, uh, uh, fuck, what's, what's the, what's the wreck?
00:55:36 Oh God, I got the COVID brain fog.
00:55:37 Azumi?
00:55:38 Azumi, yes.
00:55:39 Yeah, yeah.
00:55:40 Like that COVID brain fog, uh, of Azumi rescuing Uwupiti from the vat as well.
00:55:45 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:55:46 We both had that idea.
00:55:48 So I think, I think, I guess in the alpha timeline, it was saved by, uh,
00:55:56 Kate, oh my God, I can't, I can't think today.
00:56:00 Kaylee?
00:56:01 Katie.
00:56:02 Katie.
00:56:03 And, and that was the, the one that's in the jar with the piss.
00:56:06 And then I guess the one that Azumi saved became Forman Uwupiti?
00:56:11 Maybe?
00:56:12 I don't know.
00:56:13 Yeah, I guess that, I guess that makes sense.
00:56:15 At a time, I think I was like, I had written a bit of like Red Noir because it was like,
00:56:22 it was like, it was a big thing going on with the, the, the Chris Chan, uh, bicarbonate rain
00:56:29 colliding with endless war saga.
00:56:31 It was very funny.
00:56:32 It was very funny.
00:56:33 And so I had like, oh, it was raining.
00:56:35 What about like a noir film?
00:56:37 What if written man was a noir guy?
00:56:39 I can't remember why I came up with that, but that was part of the, the fun was that
00:56:42 it's raining and it's bicarbonate rain and he was going to try and figure it out.
00:56:46 When it, when it's raining in a, in a city, you gotta put on a trench code and solve a mystery.
00:56:52 And I remember, I remember like writing down like a big like mystery for him to solve and it
00:56:58 would be like so fucking in depth and it would involve slime corp and everything and red man
00:57:03 would be like solving the mystery.
00:57:04 And like, because Azumi, because Tom made that thing, Azumi would be involved.
00:57:08 Azumi would be doing things and it's like, okay, what factions are there and what,
00:57:12 who's Katie aligned with?
00:57:14 Oh my God, there's so much stuff there.
00:57:15 And it's, it was too complicated.
00:57:16 And also you hadn't finished slime and punishment.
00:57:19 So I didn't know where it was going and I didn't know what to do.
00:57:22 So I just sort of gave up.
00:57:23 Yeah. Yeah, that's too bad, but it's understandable.
00:57:28 I guess it took me like two years.
00:57:33 I didn't think it would take me that long.
00:57:34 I mean, now that it's about to be finished, I guess I could like retroactively finish Red Noir.
00:57:41 I did always, I did always want to see Red Noir finished.
00:57:45 I always thought it was pretty cool.
00:57:47 I like, maybe Red Man is in like one of the timelines that just gets completely
00:57:52 destroyed and everyone dies.
00:57:55 Oh, use, I mean.
00:57:57 Dimensions, what I mean.
00:57:58 I mean, yeah.
00:58:03 Yeah, I mean, there's, I think it's, it's a bit, I think, I'm just trying to think if there's
00:58:11 a difference between dimensions and timelines, whatever.
00:58:16 Um, the, you saw, I mean, you, I know you saw the, um,
00:58:20 the slime and punishment update that is just a Red Man comic.
00:58:24 Yes.
00:58:25 With the guitar.
00:58:26 Yeah, I thought, I thought that was pretty funny.
00:58:29 I thought that was pretty clever.
00:58:31 I was like patting myself on the back like, haha, haha, I did it.
00:58:36 Big iron, big iron, big iron.
00:58:42 So all these references, all these fucking references.
00:58:44 Nobody who, imagine not knowing anything about like Endless War or the PCP or anything.
00:58:55 And you read that, you read those pages.
00:58:59 What, what, what, I don't know.
00:59:02 I don't even know.
00:59:03 It's for the hardcore fans.
00:59:05 I think so.
00:59:06 I really think so.
00:59:09 Man, I don't know.
00:59:11 Man, I hope my book sells a million copies, but it can't.
00:59:14 It's, it can't.
00:59:15 But I hope it sells to a few people.
00:59:19 I hope it sells to a small number of people who really appreciate,
00:59:23 and I hope they all buy 10 copies each.
00:59:25 That's my, that's what I want.
00:59:27 Yeah.
00:59:30 Hang on, I need to pee.
00:59:33 Okay.
00:59:34 Getting that, I'll just, I'll just opine to myself then that getting that book made
00:59:41 is going to be really hard.
00:59:45 Let's, okay, I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, we, weeks blend into each other,
00:59:48 and I, I don't remember whether I talked about this at last episode.
00:59:51 I say that more and more every, every time.
00:59:55 Uh, I think I did mention this, that I decided that I think I'm gonna switch from
00:59:59 a homestuck book, or a problem sleuth book style running commentary on the bottom of every page
01:00:05 to a infinite jest style, uh, footnotes and annotations in a, in a section at the back.
01:00:12 And, uh, that's actually gonna be a lot of writing.
01:00:16 I mean, I guess I'll, I probably, I'll try not to overthink it.
01:00:20 It's not gonna be like I'm writing a story.
01:00:21 It's just gonna be like writing off the top of my head,
01:00:24 like whatever I think about, oh, here's what I have to say about this page.
01:00:29 Okay, but it's actually gonna be a lot,
01:00:30 because like I'm probably gonna have something to say about,
01:00:35 maybe not most pages, but like a lot, a lot of pages
01:00:38 require, or at least would benefit from, some additional context,
01:00:45 like what we're talking about today.
01:00:47 Oh, are you talking about?
01:00:48 That's actually gonna, the stuff?
01:00:51 Yeah, the foot, the footnotes and annotations that I'm gonna have to write for the book.
01:00:56 Like this, like this stuff we're talking about right now.
01:00:58 I want to include all of this in a little like section at the back to explain like,
01:01:01 hey, if you haven't, if you're not familiar with the context of the story, let, let me explain.
01:01:05 Well, you see, Uwupati was created as a psychological weapon to manipulate
01:01:10 Christian Wesson-Chantler into retweeting my Kickstarter.
01:01:15 For an unrelated comic.
01:01:17 Totally, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:01:20 Yeah, so.
01:01:21 It failed spectacularly, and Uwupati died, except he didn't, except it didn't.
01:01:28 I caught myself.
01:01:28 It did fail spectacularly, but also it was a huge success because everybody loves Uwupati.
01:01:35 And I should make a plush.
01:01:36 I should make an Uwupati plush.
01:01:39 Should steal your idea.
01:01:40 I should steal your idea.
01:01:41 You know what?
01:01:41 I should just copy Gibbon.
01:01:43 I should just like do whatever Gibbon take does and just make a plush of a thing.
01:01:47 You'll have to play royalties because I came up with the idea of making plushes.
01:01:52 Well, okay.
01:01:55 Well, you have to pay royalties because I came up
01:01:58 with the idea of making you pay royalties to me for doing a thing that I did.
01:02:04 So you see circles, circles within circles within spheres, sparkles, sparkles within
01:02:15 cubes within rectangles.
01:02:18 I have been I've been playing a little too much Noida.
01:02:22 I've been playing a little too much Noida this week.
01:02:25 I've been like getting to I've been looking at a page and being like,
01:02:29 I don't want to draw this.
01:02:30 I don't want to think that drawing drawing these these these this chapter is uncomfortable.
01:02:38 And for all the reasons re stated before, I feel demotivated from working on it.
01:02:44 Therefore, oh, just a little Noida, just a little Noida.
01:02:48 You can't do just a little Noida.
01:02:51 It's like you can't do just little Noida.
01:02:53 It's you're committing yourself to like a month straight of playing that and perfecting it like
01:02:58 you did last time.
01:03:00 You play you play a little Noida.
01:03:02 Well, I'm trying I'm trying to win fast.
01:03:05 I'm not trying I'm not trying to do like long runs where I make the sun and whatever.
01:03:10 I'm trying to get I'm trying to get streaks.
01:03:12 So I'll be like, OK, I'll just play a little quick Noida.
01:03:14 Try and win as fast as I can.
01:03:15 Try and win in under an hour.
01:03:17 OK. Oh, I lost.
01:03:18 Oh, well, better try again.
01:03:19 I lost. Well, better try again.
01:03:21 Oh, I won.
01:03:23 Well, oh, I won.
01:03:24 Well, OK, better try again and see if I can get a streak going.
01:03:28 Oh, I lost.
01:03:29 Well, better start a streak.
01:03:31 Better try again.
01:03:33 Yeah, I almost got my record.
01:03:37 I brought my fastest win record down.
01:03:38 It's like an hour and five minutes, though.
01:03:41 So I could win it under an hour.
01:03:44 You shouldn't think I had an incredible run.
01:03:47 I had an incredible run yesterday that I died
01:03:50 in a very stupid way, as you often do.
01:03:53 And I was really mad game game just gave me game just fucking handed me everything.
01:03:58 Game handed me the win on a silver platter and I still managed to die.
01:04:04 That's the way it goes.
01:04:05 I saw this video where this guy had to physically take steps in the real world
01:04:14 and then spend those steps in a Pokemon game.
01:04:18 So like if you ran out of steps in the Pokemon game,
01:04:20 he would have to do like a jog and like rack up steps
01:04:24 so that he could use them in the game.
01:04:26 And it was like a playthrough of a Pokemon.
01:04:28 I think it was like a diamond shining diamond or whatever.
01:04:33 Wait, rack up steps?
01:04:35 Like how many steps does it take to beat Pokemon?
01:04:38 But I use the steps from real life.
01:04:41 Was he doing like a...
01:04:43 Wait, what?
01:04:45 One of the Pokemon games tracks your steps.
01:04:48 I don't know which one.
01:04:49 Oh, like an exercise tracker?
01:04:51 No, no, no, in game.
01:04:52 Like how many steps you take just as a like a metric.
01:04:56 Oh, okay.
01:04:57 Because of that, he can like keep track and he uses his like a fitness app
01:05:02 or whatever to track his steps in real life.
01:05:04 So it goes on like a jog and it's like exercising.
01:05:08 Exercising.
01:05:09 Like you can only use in the game as many steps as you did in real life.
01:05:14 Yes, yes, that's the idea.
01:05:15 Maybe you should do that for Noita.
01:05:16 Maybe you should like to put some sort of soft cap
01:05:21 on how much Noita you can play.
01:05:23 You have to do something to like allow yourself.
01:05:27 I can only guzzle as much brine in Noita as I do in real life.
01:05:37 Yes.
01:05:37 That'll put a hard cap on my operations for sure.
01:05:43 Yeah.
01:05:46 But I don't know.
01:05:48 I shouldn't...
01:05:49 I don't blame Noita.
01:05:51 I blame myself.
01:05:52 The Noita is just a symptom.
01:05:54 Me playing Noita is not keeping me from working.
01:05:58 I'm choosing not to work.
01:06:00 And then in the absence of that, I'm playing Noita instead.
01:06:04 And that's on me.
01:06:05 That's a...
01:06:07 It's not a problem with Noita.
01:06:08 It's a problem with me.
01:06:11 But I literally am...
01:06:16 The last page I have to do of the like post game scene
01:06:23 It's four panels, but they all have the same background.
01:06:27 Like it's four images that take place in the same background.
01:06:30 So the background is like mostly drawn.
01:06:34 I just have to like finish drawing the background
01:06:37 and then draw Phantom walking in the four different positions in it.
01:06:43 And then that scene is done.
01:06:47 So like that's all I have left to do on that.
01:06:49 And then I think the last...
01:06:52 The ending I'm thinking...
01:06:54 If I go with the idea that I have now,
01:06:57 I don't think I'm even gonna like have backgrounds.
01:07:01 I'm gonna make it very like...
01:07:05 Very minimalist.
01:07:06 Except for maybe like...
01:07:08 Maybe like a scene or...
01:07:09 No!
01:07:09 Maybe it's...
01:07:10 Actually, I'm not sure if that's true.
01:07:13 I'm kicking around some...
01:07:15 Taking around...
01:07:16 I'm kicking around some ideas and they're solidifying.
01:07:18 You know what it is?
01:07:19 It's just gonna be the end of Neon Genesis,
01:07:21 Save and Gillian with the White.
01:07:23 I'm taking a long time...
01:07:24 I'm taking a long time on purpose
01:07:26 because it's letting ideas slosh around and cohere in my head
01:07:30 about what the ending should...
01:07:32 About what the final, final ending should look like.
01:07:36 And indeed...
01:07:38 And indeed the concept has evolved as I've just kind of...
01:07:44 Yeah.
01:07:44 As I've just kind of let it simmer in my mind for these several weeks.
01:07:48 I feel like I get impatient for some things where I'm like,
01:07:54 it's gonna end and I want it to be good,
01:07:58 but I know that I can't make it be good.
01:08:00 Oh, just fucking throw something together and post.
01:08:04 That's how I do...
01:08:05 That's how I write my emails to like important people.
01:08:09 I'm like, oh, this has to be good.
01:08:10 That's just to be professional, but I can't do that.
01:08:14 Just send.
01:08:15 I know what you mean.
01:08:16 Like if it's something important...
01:08:20 Sometimes if it's something that you feel like is important,
01:08:23 you gotta just be like, well, I don't know how to make this good,
01:08:29 so I'm just gonna do whatever.
01:08:31 Yeah.
01:08:32 And it'll just be how it's gonna be.
01:08:35 Yeah.
01:08:39 Yeah.
01:08:39 Which is like, it's simultaneously a good way to get things done,
01:08:43 but also really annoying because then...
01:08:47 If only you spent a little more time, you could have made it so much better
01:08:50 and I'm like, oh, that's true, but also I would have never finished it.
01:08:53 Yeah, in the long run, it's better.
01:08:57 It's kind of better to just do shit and not worry about it.
01:09:00 And if you do more shit, more of it will be good.
01:09:06 True.
01:09:08 Yeah.
01:09:10 So I'm not too worried about my approach there,
01:09:13 but it does feel like people get the wrong impression of my potential
01:09:22 because I stopped short of really going for something a lot of the time.
01:09:27 And then when I actually do try a bit, it's like, wow,
01:09:30 this is the best thing I've ever seen you do.
01:09:31 And I'm like, well, you think this is impressive for me?
01:09:37 I could do this the whole time, you motherfucker.
01:09:41 Yeah, but you didn't.
01:09:42 I didn't because I was...
01:09:49 I was thinking, I think I was looking at some artists on Twitter.
01:09:54 I was looking at some drawings.
01:09:55 Drawings of a character.
01:10:01 If you're an artist on Twitter, you might have a character that you draw
01:10:05 and maybe you draw them in a cool outfit or in a cool background
01:10:11 or just like they look cool.
01:10:13 Yeah.
01:10:13 Like just draw a character looking cool, doing something cool,
01:10:17 or not even just looking a cool way.
01:10:19 And I don't know.
01:10:22 I think there's something wrong with me because I see something like that
01:10:30 that's just kind of like good for its own sake.
01:10:34 It's just like kind of just something that just sort of looks good
01:10:37 and people just like it because it looks good.
01:10:40 And my reaction is like, what's the fucking point of that?
01:10:43 What a waste of fucking time.
01:10:45 I think I may understand what that is.
01:10:48 Yeah.
01:10:49 It's like it's not part of...
01:10:56 Yeah.
01:10:56 Like it's just sort of, I think it may be that there's so much of that on Twitter.
01:11:01 There's so many good artists posting good art that they made and they're skilled
01:11:06 and you just scroll past it because you've seen it already.
01:11:09 You've seen stuff that's similarly good.
01:11:11 And you're just sort of numb to quality.
01:11:15 And it's like, well, surely there could be something else that this good art could be doing for me,
01:11:22 which is really selfish actually.
01:11:25 But I'm numb to quality because there's so much well drawn and well conceived
01:11:34 and attractive and cool art.
01:11:37 Honestly, like amazingly good artists are just the dime a dozen.
01:11:42 There's a billion of them on Twitter.
01:11:45 It's like crazy.
01:11:46 And I feel similar.
01:11:48 It's like, shouldn't I be like plugging right now?
01:11:51 Shouldn't I be like going insane?
01:11:52 I'm seeing this thing and it's like, this is a really cool design, really well done.
01:11:57 I couldn't do that in a million years.
01:11:59 Just keep scrolling.
01:12:00 Don't even like it.
01:12:01 Don't even retweet it.
01:12:02 No, we have whatever.
01:12:04 Saw something better yesterday though.
01:12:07 Saw something just as good.
01:12:10 So like, yeah, it's like, I don't know.
01:12:14 I think the way to succeed as an artist, I feel like, is just to churn out a lot of things
01:12:25 that are good and that people like.
01:12:27 You just keep making pieces that people like.
01:12:31 That's how you make good art, I guess.
01:12:34 Well, that's how you make social media success is that you have a consistent stream of good
01:12:38 quality stuff that like.
01:12:41 I would say even before social media, that was probably the way to do it.
01:12:47 I mean, you wouldn't sell or show before the internet, you wouldn't do that sort of stuff.
01:12:52 You would draw all the time if you're an illustrator, but you would get freelance work, I think.
01:12:58 Well, you would probably, I mean, you would probably just like build up a portfolio,
01:13:02 but you would only put like 5% of the art you actually make in that to show people to get jobs,
01:13:08 right?
01:13:09 But you would be, if you didn't have a job and you were an artist, you would probably be
01:13:14 painting stuff and then maybe you would probably try to sell them, right?
01:13:18 You would try to sell your paintings in some.
01:13:22 I mean, an art is very broad, so it depends, but like, I guess so.
01:13:28 Yeah, I guess you wouldn't necessarily be a painter exactly.
01:13:33 Yeah, okay, sure.
01:13:36 But I don't think, what I mean is I don't think success always, like you don't have to do it
01:13:44 that way.
01:13:45 You don't have to be putting out things that are of high quality,
01:13:51 of like no specific reason, just sort of like an image, I like it, you put it up there.
01:14:00 You could make images that suck, but like have more interesting aspect to it, like what I do.
01:14:07 That's why I do comics is you can have a bit of context and it makes the fact that the drawings
01:14:12 are not like the perfect drawing.
01:14:14 It doesn't matter so much because you can get attached to the character or the story that's
01:14:18 happening.
01:14:19 Well, I just feel like, I feel like, you know, it's a pretty, I think it's a reasonable expectation
01:14:27 of an artist that you make, that you put out a fairly consistent stream of high quality work
01:14:36 that is attractive to people and that appeals to people, right?
01:14:41 And I think the fact that I feel sort of allergic to that is probably just terrible.
01:14:48 It's probably just really bad for me and my success in life.
01:14:54 Like you feel allergic because you couldn't imagine you doing something like that or you
01:14:59 wouldn't want to?
01:14:59 Well, because my response, because I feel negatively about that sort of thing, but that's
01:15:09 like the kind of thing that is like good, that I'm like, oh, sure.
01:15:18 Oh, just make attractive character art that appeals to people that people like and want
01:15:25 to share and stuff.
01:15:26 Well, good for you, I guess.
01:15:31 I used to make me sick.
01:15:33 Come back when you were a real artist like me after you've spent two years doing a fucking
01:15:38 Sonichu, a fucking big, weird, stupid, like, I don't even know, it's a fan comic, but it's
01:15:46 sort of like, it's sort of like, like a, I guess it would partially call it a sort of
01:15:51 like performance art in that it was sort of improvised on the fly in order to evoke a reaction
01:15:57 from a specific person, a lot of it was.
01:16:01 I don't know.
01:16:03 Whatever it is, I spent two years doing it and if you didn't fuck you.
01:16:09 I mean, we already knew that like mass appeal does not come from extremely niche things and
01:16:17 success often requires a bit of mass appeal or at least some avenue by which you can tap that
01:16:25 market like.
01:16:27 I feel like what's what's something like slime and slime and punishment needs
01:16:32 like an event like evangelists, it needs like Bards like explaining it like the way that like
01:16:37 Vati Vidya like explains Dark Souls to to people or Dark Souls in general, the people
01:16:44 you know, it's sort of on its own.
01:16:47 Yeah, yeah.
01:16:47 Dark Souls has Vati Vidya Five Nights at Freddy's has Matt Pat.
01:16:51 You need you need one of those for slime and punishment.
01:16:55 I feel like on its own it will it's just it's just met with it'll just be met with bemusement.
01:17:01 Like what what am I supposed to make of this?
01:17:05 You know, so that's why I got a right.
01:17:07 So that's so that's why I got a right footnotes and errata and stuff but like is that enough?
01:17:13 I don't know.
01:17:14 I guess my hope my guess my hope for like the Kickstarter right because like the way that I
01:17:19 want to turn this all into a I didn't waste my time is I don't want to sell make a book and
01:17:25 sell a book do a Kickstarter sell the book and so I guess I hope that just the that just the
01:17:31 the niche-ness and the inscrutability of it will be curious enough of a curiosity enough of a novelty
01:17:39 that maybe people who don't even know me might hear about it in some way maybe when I do a
01:17:44 big push to like yeah push the Kickstarter maybe people would hear about it and be intrigued by
01:17:49 it and be like yeah sure I'll pick it yeah what's this I guess I'll grab one let me see what it's
01:17:53 all about that's what I hope and I just don't know if it's true I don't know if it'll work out
01:17:59 if it doesn't I'll feel disappointed you know yeah I I've I've been feeling I've been feeling
01:18:11 trepidatious about the Pumpkin Alley possible Kickstarter as well yeah because it's like
01:18:17 like it's a very different thing to like fund a video game yeah and to know how long it's gonna
01:18:27 take how much money is required where to put it and like yeah whether or not I have currently
01:18:34 enough notoriety with this to get it to that level because like what did what did my um
01:18:42 load of ghosts it got like around six thousand almost six six six six six I think pounds pounds
01:18:52 yes um which is amazing um yeah further just a lot of ghosts but like Radcon four or something
01:19:02 Radcon three I forget which one they made like made like 30 grand yeah Radcon four made like 32
01:19:09 or 34 thousand yeah and and like okay well we'll need a lot more than just that for a video game
01:19:16 but like how do I how do I I don't think enough people know about it so what if it fails what if
01:19:24 we just don't get we can't get enough money to make Pumpkin Alley I don't want to I don't want to
01:19:29 risk that I want to risk it like oh well I guess we can't make the video game I uh so I'm a little
01:19:35 scared I'm a little scared hmm I mean video game kick starters have a sort of uh track record you
01:19:44 know what I mean they have a lot of them a lot of them over promise and and and things go and
01:19:51 things go pear shaped well I guess a lot of them do but like I'm I'm I'm looking at things like a
01:19:57 hat in time and Hollow Knight and and a lot of those projects they had a lot of publicity before
01:20:05 the Kickstarter started so I feel like I need to like make the circuit make the go to some games
01:20:12 conventions and show off the demo and then slowly be working on bits and bobs here and there before
01:20:19 before I like actually say okay video game now but like I don't know it's it's really rough it
01:20:27 seems like yeah it seems like a lot of the big success stories out of like indie uh uh crowdfund
01:20:34 gaming yeah they were like already successful before they even came out like uh Lisa had a big
01:20:42 push uh like Jim like Jim Sterling was pushing Lisa uh you know Andrew Hussie and a bunch of other
01:20:49 people were pushing Undertale uh Toby later and then later Toby Fox and a bunch of other people a
01:20:56 lot of people were pushing like Yeek uh and like how do I I guess those I guess I guess the Yeek
01:21:04 guys had made a game before just like a game that nobody played so I don't know so I don't know how
01:21:10 they got all these uh it's it's I don't know how you get I don't know how you get this shit well
01:21:15 you just got to get publicity and to do that you got to have a cool thing to show people and I feel
01:21:21 like starting a Kickstarter before I have any like the the PCP audience is so small now compared
01:21:31 to where it was before um in terms of like people who would see the podcast and be like oh cool it
01:21:36 gives making game uh so much smaller than it's it's shrank for sure yeah and like I can't rely on
01:21:43 all the all the Nate all the Nate heads and the and the digi heads have all uh have all migrated
01:21:49 to I don't know eat glue some somewhere else I guess yeah and then like it would be cool but like
01:21:58 if the if they could shout it out but like I can't I can't rely on that and even then uh
01:22:06 well I guess Nate is about the same but Trixie is no longer a big draw a big like uh
01:22:12 force in like she tweets about something nobody pays attention anymore I don't think there's
01:22:16 a small small fan base that she has no and so like her her the big the biggest the she made her
01:22:24 her biggest tweet uh in a while the other day uh saying like uh my uh video is gonna be late
01:22:31 because of someone in my family died and everyone was like oh I'm so sorry for your loss got it got
01:22:35 a hundred likes it was it it was a big it was a big tentpole moment well I mean it sucks that someone
01:22:42 did he died but yeah sure uh it's probably like probably an uncle or something uh um gotta gotta
01:22:49 go to the funeral or whatever but yeah it's like uh if if there was like youtuber power I I guess I
01:22:59 could message a few people but like not really I would I would need to like gain some some notoriety
01:23:08 from the the ground up kind of not like completely from the ground up I'm I'm lucky and have like
01:23:13 the platform I already do uh yeah so I can push it a bit but like it's gonna take some doing before
01:23:20 I feel like it's it's like going to work for a Kickstarter yeah but I don't know I don't I don't
01:23:28 want to wait too long either so uh duh that's been on my mind it's yeah I mean yeah I guess
01:23:39 man I guess I guess trying to hmm you you make sense it makes sense to be like well I gotta you
01:23:48 know I want to have want to try and have as much cloud as I can before I launch the project
01:23:56 but how but how much can you get right I like damn if I knew if I knew how to get if I knew how to
01:24:02 get that cloud if I knew how to get those connections get like big people tweeting about my my project
01:24:09 or whatever like yeah man part of me wish I knew too part of me is like well I mean I could always
01:24:17 just become a super mega star youtuber by doing hypocrite again which is like it's everything's
01:24:25 a gamble that may not work at all but yeah it was it was the thing like video game reviewer of that
01:24:33 sort of a type of game uh fan base built from that would be interested in a pump canali yeah so
01:24:41 like that that's something I've been thinking of like should I should I cynically go back to
01:24:45 making hypocrite videos for that I don't feel like the time investment is worth it though
01:24:50 because to make good videos is very time intensive if your heart wasn't in it I don't feel like
01:24:57 they would be good no no I mean it wouldn't be like no it wouldn't be like um
01:25:04 I feel like the reason I got burnt out on hypocrite was more that I was just sort of chasing
01:25:10 algorithmic success and monetization and I didn't really have a goal I was just like
01:25:15 talk about this I'll talk about that yeah I feel like if I'm doing it for the purposes of funding
01:25:21 a video game there could be more motivation behind it and it would be fine uh yeah so like
01:25:30 I'm just thinking I just uh yeah fair enough I just I don't know if uh I don't know if it
01:25:37 really makes sense to you know that's like a like I see the connection but it's kind of like a
01:25:45 totally different thing like I don't feel like that's the most direct way of like getting support for
01:25:52 your game dev is to like throw yourself entirely into review review videos on youtube you know what
01:26:01 I mean true it's not obviously a good thing even if it is the biggest like number generator for you
01:26:08 I mean it's it's really just like how do you get people to know about anything I have a youtube
01:26:16 channel I don't know whether it's like because it's been dormant for so many years if it's like
01:26:22 you have some plakarismically unviable anymore I think that sometimes that happens to
01:26:27 dormant channels they just don't get pushed even if you start making new videos
01:26:31 um but like maybe like game dev logs sometimes get a lot of attention if they're interesting
01:26:39 so this is that that's like I'm torn I'm torn between stuff like I could spend my time
01:26:48 working on other projects which are also niche comic stuff yeah and I don't know how much that
01:26:55 would help I could stream more often I could become a streamer like I'm just thinking of like
01:27:02 how do you get this shit out there I mean some people do uh like just they make games and they
01:27:09 just stream themselves working on their games I haven't seen any of those I mean I've seen devlogs
01:27:16 on youtube but I haven't seen streams about it though yeah I mean Matt yeah I was gonna say
01:27:20 Matthew Matosis does that but Matthew Matosis was like a already huge youtuber well yeah sure he's
01:27:29 kind of big but I mean he can't he can't be the only one uh I mean every viewer of the
01:27:39 progress knitters podcast should share and talk about pumpkin alley and send it to all your friends
01:27:45 well I agree I agree with that uh that's an easy thing to do just say hey play this demo
01:27:52 there we're gonna make a hot fix actually some time in the future next few days um or maybe it's
01:27:58 already out uh just to to improve a little bit of the the jumping and a few glitches
01:28:06 so play the play the new version when that's out even if you played the old version it won't be
01:28:13 that much different but uh do it man um I feel like damn okay I not not well I guess sorry to
01:28:24 change the subject but it just dawned on me again how much I it's I think I I I would say it fucked
01:28:34 up because I had reasons for doing everything that I did and I don't think it was like a bad idea but
01:28:39 I did really I did really kind of uh uh pop my own bubble a bit with like the game because I was
01:28:49 I'm I was really excited to see how everyone would respond to the game I was really excited to see
01:28:56 people like maybe talk about the game maybe compare like oh how did how did it go for me like how did
01:29:03 I oh how did I do it oh how did you do it wait oh does that work okay maybe I don't know I was I was
01:29:10 anxiously hopeful that maybe I would see some discussion about it maybe it would get
01:29:14 people engage right see people engaging with it uh but I really popped my bubble by sharing it
01:29:20 with the patrons which I don't really regret doing but I really I don't even really think about it
01:29:25 anymore I really feel as though oh everyone's seen it already oh everyone's already played it
01:29:30 it's not true no I definitely they they certainly have not played it almost nobody has in the grand
01:29:36 scheme of things uh only probably like maybe 20 20 people have played it if 20 something like that
01:29:45 um but you know they they all told me what they thought and so like eh whatever eh never mind
01:29:53 I'm joking um but um gosh it will be pretty exciting even even though it uh it irrationally
01:30:03 feels like it's already happened it will probably be pretty cool anyway when I release it for real
01:30:10 I should I really what what gets me motivated is focusing on that feeling of oh but it's going
01:30:16 to be so good when I release it oh it's going to be so good when it's actually done and I put it out
01:30:20 and you know people can see it and I can hear people's thoughts about it and stuff so you know uh um
01:30:29 I did kind of kill I could kill that a little bit by sharing with the patrons but I mean my patrons
01:30:36 deserve it so I should not punish them by uh slacking and uh uh uh dragging my feet just because I
01:30:47 did that to myself yes okay video games this I think I think definitely this week
01:30:59 I think I think I definitely will have it done this week like like the final the final page that
01:31:04 I was describing the four panels that have the same background I will probably get that done today
01:31:09 like it's it's really close and then the final update there's no way I won't finish it this
01:31:16 week like there's just no way never say that unless unless unless you play noita for another 25
01:31:23 hours unless I have some wacky idea that ends up being like oh like that would be really good
01:31:32 but it would take a lot of work you know it would be really good uh uh another animation
01:31:37 oh another video game I was considering uh possibly some sort of um ending with kind of a
01:31:46 sort of a sort of powers of 10 zoom out you know what I mean do you know what I'm talking about
01:31:53 uh no I mean I mean like like a zoom out from like oh shows the planet oh shows the galaxy oh
01:32:01 shows the universe oh shows the dimensions oh shows the like you know it's all like it's all
01:32:07 inside of a thing inside of a thing inside of a thing uh honestly that and then it's probably
01:32:12 wouldn't even uh it's it's did you bronies eye at the end oh my god you spoiled it
01:32:18 yeah I well no that's not like that was gonna be the joke but that was like one thing I was
01:32:24 thinking like okay yeah what what what if I do a sequence yeah like like a zoom out zoom out zoom
01:32:30 out and then in the zoom out there are a bunch of like stupid things and and one of them would have
01:32:35 been yeah inside did you bronies eye uh but that wouldn't probably wouldn't have been the last thing
01:32:40 I don't know what the last thing I mean it's a reference to an old t-bap joke it's a reference
01:32:45 actually there were oh no no I had another idea I I guess I'll say it fuck it because I don't know
01:32:51 if I'll do it but I was thinking no you know I don't want to say you know what actually I actually
01:32:57 I actually don't want to say it because I probably will do it and I don't want to
01:33:02 I don't want to spoil the feeling you know I don't want to do more of what I've already
01:33:06 done to myself killing my yes my drive to complete it so I'll just I know what it is phantom horn
01:33:12 is zooms out and phantom horns fucking something
01:33:17 he's fucking the that's it damn fuck shit not elisar bleep that out elisar we can't have them
01:33:28 no elisar elisar elisar please elisar save me elisar punish give yeah bullying me
01:33:36 hey you give my good friend elisar just told me that you believe been saying please stop it thank you
01:33:44 I'm can you west I don't know that's my week I didn't do anything
01:33:49 I uh I have been as I said I finished the uh the ghosts most of the days was just sort of like
01:33:57 setting up the the sewing stuff and just sitting there listening to ukraine podcasts and in the
01:34:05 I still don't um uh hearing about all that stuff while I was just like sewing little ghosts up
01:34:10 I still don't really know anything about ukraine I mean I hear stuff that's happening
01:34:16 I don't uh I don't have like a I don't have like an informed opinion uh you know I guess my
01:34:22 you know my take was like war bad rush is doing war that's bad so Russia bad glory to ukraine
01:34:31 lamal uh but also like I don't know I've heard some people say that America and NATO kind of like
01:34:38 sort of set this up on purpose I've heard some people say like uh no no no is is that I don't
01:34:45 know if that's like some some nonsense what I've heard is that there are people simping for Russia
01:34:51 because they've like this Russian propaganda that makes this invasion out to be like
01:34:58 um like a necessary evil because of American encroachment or something NATO expansionism
01:35:06 but like fundamentally Putin just wants this country to be part of his Russian empire and
01:35:13 there's no like justification for that the people of Ukraine did not want it which is why there's a war
01:35:19 and that's about as simple as it can get if if Ukraine wanted to be part of Russia
01:35:24 then they could vote on it they could just you know they could do something about it but like
01:35:30 they don't the democrat the the the democratic or democratically elected leader of Ukraine
01:35:37 uh does not want to be part of Russia yeah and he was like voted in with a large majority
01:35:45 and so as far as I see uh the invading to take back the like this land that used to be part of
01:35:51 the USSR has no justification beyond but I want it I it's mine I am the big Russian man I want it
01:36:02 and it's like come on shut up you dumb fuck right yeah okay uh yeah I just uh you know I
01:36:15 I that's mostly what I hear uh but like I you know haven't looked into it enough to have an informed
01:36:22 opinion on why the like oh this is actually like NATO's fault thing people are are wrong or right
01:36:30 or anything I just uh I mean NATO NATO is a coalition it's like a like an organization of
01:36:37 countries nearby Russia who are scared of Russia and do not want to be invaded by Russia
01:36:42 right and they are backed or like US is part of it um and I think people who just hate the US
01:36:53 think that like the countries within NATO are like puppet states for the US and so they're like
01:36:59 oh it's just the US meddling in European in European affairs when it's it's much more like
01:37:06 these European countries would like to remain like themselves they don't want to be swallowed
01:37:12 by Russia that's the whole reason they joined NATO and it was like a voluntary thing and they
01:37:17 I don't know there's a lot there's a lot there's a lot to hear about it but like
01:37:22 the the idea that these it's all the the US's fault and therefore Russian bombing
01:37:31 and and killing civilians take over Ukraine is in any way justified is very strange
01:37:39 and I don't really know where their heads at yeah because I haven't seen like any
01:37:44 credible evidence of any kind that like what Russia is doing is uh good not that like like
01:37:54 you could say the US is meddling and maybe that's true but I haven't seen any evidence
01:38:00 specifics but like let's say it's true Russia is still also doing a bad thing
01:38:06 by meddling in Ukraine I think it would be better if neither the US nor Russia was trying to do it
01:38:13 to do anything I see so it's like there's no there's no justification for the invasion even
01:38:20 if America is being a sneaky beaky which is very likely because the US is a bit of a sneaky beaky
01:38:26 all over the world we are we can be a bit of a sneaky beaky it's uh it's a well-known thing
01:38:34 yeah uh okay that all makes that all seems cogent yeah uh I want to uh hey what are we gonna do
01:38:45 about Spotify and Apple podcasts and stuff uh I don't know how to do it I Tom Tom does it
01:38:53 we just got he's not we gotta he's just not he's just not answering me he just hasn't been around
01:38:58 lately we just gotta go over there and get him out of his wheelchair kick him down and say where's
01:39:07 the podcast and he'll say oh I'm making a video game instead I just uh I just I like I I've been
01:39:15 up I've been uploading the the podcast to YouTube for the last few weeks which like you know
01:39:23 it's okay I'm not complaining but like yeah I don't know how to do he had like a thing he had like
01:39:30 a webhook uh rss thing set up that like I think it automatically did the uh like Spotify Apple
01:39:39 podcasts uploads and stuff and I just I don't know how I don't think I even have access to that
01:39:46 and I don't know how to use these uh platforms and I've never interacted with them I mean have
01:39:50 you DM'd Tom about it I I haven't DM'd him but I've added him in the chat maybe he's more receptive
01:39:57 to DMs I don't know maybe he has the chat he showed up or something he showed he showed up to uh oh
01:40:05 he doesn't want to he doesn't want to talk about uh Spotify but he'll show up to he'll show up uh to
01:40:12 when Jesse complains uh that's stupid uh but whatever I get I get I guess that's fine that's
01:40:20 how you want to be um man just just uh just help just help just help me out Tom people keep asking
01:40:30 me I just got a message on Twitter it's like Ben please upload them I want the episodes on Spotify
01:40:36 and I'm just like I don't I don't know how I don't know how to help with that uh
01:40:47 I don't want to sound I don't want to sound like ungrateful or anything for like you know
01:40:51 if it weren't for Tom uploading them to those other things then they just simply wouldn't be there
01:40:57 yeah so I appreciate it and all but I can't you know I can't do it I mean I get I guess I could
01:41:04 learn but I don't want to I don't want to figure I don't want to learn Spotify or Apple podcast or
01:41:10 whatever uh well uh go into Elden Ring and invade him and kill him oh it's right that's the only
01:41:23 that's the only way you gotta leave Elden Ring messages on the floor saying Spotify question
01:41:29 yeah yeah you just gotta get soapstone messages or uh or whatever hmm it's uh it's you gotta add
01:41:38 you gotta add him on Elden Ring it's the only social media he's using right now there now there's
01:41:44 an idea hmm uh well yeah maybe I'll DM him about it uh might be a little could be helpful I don't know
01:41:57 uh do you want to maybe go to voicemails um I want to briefly say to people waiting for their lord
01:42:04 of ghosts book um I've got uh something to have no no on Monday tomorrow but after that I'll be
01:42:12 uh packaging and sending out a big amount of uh the packages now that the ghost costumes are done
01:42:19 I'll make a a kickstart a like update about that um uh and I hope you like it and I hope there's no
01:42:29 problems in the postage I'm excited Ben you haven't given me your backer like uh mailing address
01:42:38 stuff I don't think oh oh like on Kickstarter yeah do I have to respond to the survey yes I mean
01:42:47 I mean I could just tell you yeah but like it's easier but I can do this yeah yeah um
01:42:54 did you send out like a like a backer like a request for information yeah I sent out the survey
01:43:02 I'm when was it a while ago it was a while ago yeah oh I must have missed it uh yeah okay I should
01:43:09 do that uh everyone should do that yes um yeah all right I'll have to fucking
01:43:17 log back into the log back into my old my Kickstarter account that I haven't uh looked at in a while
01:43:24 all right uh yeah let's do uh let's do voicemails shall we huh yes okay um oh no I'm logged out of
01:43:35 speakpipe uh you know I'll just post them in the chat okay because it just it just makes it easier
01:43:41 because then I don't have to repost them for uh what's his name Eleazar Eleazar yeah yeah
01:43:50 god I it's like I got the COVID brain fog today what the fuck you're just getting old Ben
01:43:56 I'm actually got it yes I said you're getting amnesia is it co is it COVID brain fog
01:44:05 I mean I didn't I didn't I didn't sleep like at all so maybe that's why but I feel it's
01:44:11 worse than usual today oh god oh god you know I read an article man oh yeah I saw oh god yeah
01:44:21 I had stopped thinking about it and then I saw an article about COVID brain damage
01:44:28 and how like yeah it makes you stupider it damages your brain and it makes you stupider
01:44:34 permanently I didn't get it well okay I guess I get permanently is I mean like you know who knows
01:44:45 but they they did um they did tests right they tested people they did cognitive tests uh
01:44:53 on people like before and after uh you know infection and they did yes they did find a
01:45:00 significant like change in performance in people afterwards but also did did they account for
01:45:09 anti-vax status like what sorts of people are they okay I don't think it accounted for I think
01:45:18 this was like pre vaccine right I think uh it it okay the worst cases like the worst cases of it
01:45:29 showed like a they gave it in terms of like standard deviations of like you know a typical
01:45:36 score on these tests you know it dropped like you know more than a standard deviation it I think
01:45:40 it said that like the the effect was equivalent to about like seven IQ points uh in the most in the
01:45:48 strongest cases um but on the other hand those were it did correlate like like how severe was your
01:45:58 case to the effect like like it's it's like the effect was present even in people that
01:46:05 had mild cases but it was like it was like much stronger it was it was stronger like the more
01:46:11 severe your disease had been like like if you'd been hospitalized if you'd been in intensive care
01:46:16 you know if you'd been put on a respirator you know the effect was stronger and all that
01:46:20 so I mean I guess I guess I can take heart because my case was mild so if it was gonna happen
01:46:27 it's probably a small effect and who knows you know some amount of it is probably not
01:46:31 permanent anyway so maybe maybe I only lost two IQ points and I'll get one of them back I don't know
01:46:43 you know yeah I mean whatever you can you can like grind free xp put those those IQ points back
01:46:51 just take full time yeah yeah you know what you know what you're absolutely right that's exactly
01:46:57 true and I don't have anything else to say about it okay anyway enough enough about that let's hear
01:47:08 from the first voicemailer son of Marowak three two one let's jam given I played your demo it was
01:47:17 awesome I really liked it yeah it's pretty good I collected all the uh those purple token things
01:47:24 one bit of not criticism just please criticize I don't know what you'd call it uh there was a bit
01:47:34 of um glitchy you like I could like I had to like reset my position because punk would just
01:47:42 fall in place yeah this took place in the third the last like big room where you jumping around
01:47:52 on the side point there are those two or three rocks that allow you to jump up to the highest
01:47:57 platform yeah and I could not or um I uh got to a point where um was like cut in between uh the
01:48:08 rocks and I couldn't jump because she was just stuck in place so figured if uh that helps you at
01:48:16 all yes yes we we've looked at this uh the the hot fix that will be out or is soon to be out um we
01:48:22 made a change where if you are stuck in the falling state and your position has not updated to anywhere
01:48:31 significantly different the game will understand that you are stuck and you will you'll be able to
01:48:36 land and you'll be you'll be able to land on that part and then from there you can jump away oh
01:48:43 so we we fixed that that doesn't happen quite so much anymore really that's interesting so you can
01:48:49 just so hmm that that kind of seems like that means that there's now a lot more places you can land
01:48:57 um yeah maybe I mean a lot of the a lot of the geometry was just sort of like uh put it there
01:49:04 whatever if people really want they can jump but it's not supposed to be there for jumping on
01:49:10 um and it's fun to like not restrict the player um but like yeah like the actual level design
01:49:18 we're probably gonna make it so that you can't sequence break quite so easily we're gonna like
01:49:24 uh you know have like very not like super linear but like linear enough that you don't like skip
01:49:32 most of the content of the level if you jump up to a certain platform um which can happen with
01:49:38 with the thing you can jump over and skip a lot of stuff but that's not really a problem for the
01:49:43 demo but getting stuck a lot yeah was definitely a thing so we've solved if you're infinitely
01:49:49 being falling animation or or like sliding animation you you stand as long like after a few
01:49:56 seconds it'll recognize you as being stuck not moving and you're able to like being the landing
01:50:03 state it will think of it as floor until you move away that you jump jump away and then
01:50:09 it'll be normal again this was this was actually that was a thing actually you know what I forgot
01:50:16 but I had a similar thing in the slime and punishment beta demo there was there was uh
01:50:24 it was possible to it was possible to spend all your slime and all your potrons and just have no uh
01:50:33 and just have no ability to do anything and you basically just couldn't take a turn uh so
01:50:41 yeah and to resolve that I what I do I added the menu you can go to the menu and you can
01:50:47 just restart you can just like quit uh that's sort of like the proof but oh but also there's now
01:50:53 like option there's options in in there's menu options that don't require slime so even if you're
01:50:59 out of slime I mean you can if you want you can just you can just dab you can just keep dabbing
01:51:05 until you die I guess uh if you if you would prefer if you want to go out like a champ uh
01:51:12 I mean you know obviously I couldn't you can't get rid of the I can't remove the ability to run
01:51:18 out of slime because that's like a core mechanic so I was like well it was it wasn't it wasn't the
01:51:24 fact that you could run out of slime and and be fucked like that's that's good that's a feature
01:51:29 not a bug the the problem was that it would feel like oh well now I can't do anything and it's
01:51:34 basically a soft lock uh it's not like it's not like I lost it's just like I cannot progress the
01:51:40 game state uh yeah I think I mean you've already made the game but like a way to make that quicker
01:51:49 would be like if you run out of slime you just die instantly uh I can you know I considered adding
01:51:59 I considered adding a suicide command that would basically be identical to just going into the menu
01:52:05 and restarting but it's I didn't do it because it seemed like uh it would just be I don't know
01:52:14 I would have to do a bunch of work making like a whole new animation for it and adding it to the
01:52:19 menu and all that stuff and it it just like kind of duplicates a function that already exists
01:52:24 it's just a it's just a restart button which there already is one of those and I mean if you
01:52:30 want to just kill yourself you can just you can just let yourself be killed you know it's not it's
01:52:36 not it's not hard uh wait what fuck oh god brain fog covid covid's back what did you say what did
01:52:44 you say what am I responding to oh my god I didn't say anything no from before that you said I said
01:52:52 you said something you said once your slang goes to zero you could just die instantly and I would solve
01:52:56 that problem of of needing to wait for well for death like oh like if you try to attack with zero
01:53:03 slime it just kills you something I bet yeah I mean in the in in endless war if you try to
01:53:11 attack with zero slime it just you just don't so you know I was trying to duplicate the right
01:53:17 the commands from that game so yeah so it's just you just get a little pop-up command it's like
01:53:24 not enough slime to attack nope nope you can't fucking do that so let's can't fucking do it
01:53:31 next one is called performance artists there it is uh three two one go one episode two nine one
01:53:40 you all talked about whether dry dump December is after bringing up the possibility of it being
01:53:45 performance art as well as the idea that aren't as anything intended to evoke an emotion in its
01:53:49 viewers which got me thinking is bullying art it's a performance intended to evoke an emotion in
01:53:55 its audience you know you could say that somebody I would say bully someone very like there's an
01:54:02 art to bullying if you want to get the the right emotion out of someone is is bullying intended
01:54:09 to evoke a reaction in the victim or is bullying intended to invoke evoke a reaction in the bully
01:54:18 I is it is it to make the bully feel good um I mean normally I feel like it's like the reaction
01:54:28 does the job of making the bully feel good for being powerful or like putting someone else down
01:54:35 right yeah yeah I think so it is for the bully's benefit that they do I think so or otherwise
01:54:42 social clout you know people laughing at someone else makes them feel good I feel like you would
01:54:48 bully there's no other reason yeah I feel like the point is not generally the point of bullying
01:54:56 is not to evoke a a complexly nuanced feeling of self-hatred and poor and low self-esteem in a
01:55:05 in a in a in an audience of one so to speak unless it's maybe it's art it's not yeah not about
01:55:15 the feeling you evoke in the victim but about in like you know the people that see you bullying
01:55:19 they think it's really funny like ha ha yeah that that nerd deserves this yeah you could you could
01:55:24 do a performatively bullying thing yeah yeah virtue signaling they call it I don't know what that
01:55:32 means what's the opposite of virtue uh vice vice signaling vice signaling vice signaling maybe
01:55:39 look everyone goes whoa what a what a scowl scallywag what a what a rogue what a lovable rogue
01:55:46 with a dark streak to him it's hot yeah that that's the my my art my art I'm an artist and my art
01:55:56 and uh it exists to evoke a feeling in the audience that I am hot and that you should have sex with
01:56:02 me uh it's it's avant garde um lamal okay next one is called uh vvv revelations to ben saint
01:56:16 about ben saint from gibbonisqtpie at patreon.com okay three two one go

01:57:27 or maybe don't I don't know okay next next voicemail uh is called update on yig three two one go
01:57:39 somebody asked trixie why did you take boy gazers off the main yig channel and she responded
01:57:45 and I guess she didn't respond to it but someone else responded saying well you know it doesn't
01:57:49 it doesn't really feel like it belongs on this channel or whatever you know it doesn't meet the
01:57:54 channel crazy basically meaning that you're right ben so uh yeah she's a fucking idiot of course I'm
01:58:01 right I see yeah yeah uh doesn't doesn't fit doesn't fit the the direction of this channel which
01:58:09 despite all that stuff I said for like a whole year uh is just anime videos now sorry just
01:58:15 anime videos now never mind all that other stuff ha ha ha oops it always felt like like all of that
01:58:22 stuff was clearly side channel content like new and interesting yeah like experimental content
01:58:29 and and the the the digi bro the the digi nay the trixie uh main channel was always like the front
01:58:38 facing the front of the store like this is where I get my viewers yeah of course and and but yeah
01:58:45 of course you can't everybody but everybody told her that like bro this goes on the side channel
01:58:50 this is side channel content what do you have a side channel for and I what was their logic it was
01:58:56 like that's where all the viewers are so I'll put it it's yeah it's that they'll like it I guess yeah
01:59:03 it's it's literally just it's like it's like a child logic it's like uh yeah it was like well I
01:59:09 it's like I have more subs on the main channel though so more people will see it like okay
01:59:15 okay like literally just like forgetting what the purpose of a side channel is
01:59:22 subscribers are a harsh mistress it's true it's sad it's sad but true but not actually sad
01:59:30 it's funny uh anyway uh there's a part two update on yig part two uh there it is three two one go
01:59:40 and I say we make her do you an apology for being such a fucking tool
01:59:49 yeah hey yeah why didn't anyone think of that yeah do uh uh what's the website where people
01:59:57 write their signatures what change.org like oh yeah yeah yeah sort of change.org petition
02:00:04 and have been uh Trixie apologized to Ben St. yes yes uh definitely uh you just need to get more
02:00:13 signatures than she has subscribers get 300 000 uh signatures on that and I'm sure and I'm sure
02:00:20 she will be and I'm sure she will see the error of her ways um it's okay no no hard feelings
02:00:29 because uh I just got all her money I just got all her money that she would have made
02:00:33 from being on the podcast it all just went to me instead and Gib I guess uh so you know
02:00:40 water under the bridge that soothes the pain uh next next video is called uh
02:00:50 Spooty Meng's Spooed Verse three two one go who is your favorite spider man
02:01:00 and why is it noir noir I did is he is he one of the spider man in the spider verse the like
02:01:08 oh I'm uh I'm red man noir uh literally red noir because he's red I mean there's a there is a
02:01:16 black spider man right you see is that like spider noir I know I don't know the that's
02:01:23 the miles morale miles tails prowl is no I mean I mean there's a I mean there's a spider man with
02:01:30 like a black costume is that Miles does the did they give the black he's got a black costume okay
02:01:36 okay I mean that's fine it looks cool it doesn't cool not as cool as Gwen though Gwen looks awesome
02:01:43 spider Gwen's costume is so fucking cool yes we cannot we can all agree on that she's the best
02:01:48 the best looking uh but if I had to actually pick my favorite spider man it would be the 60s spider
02:01:54 man from the 60s spider man tv show in color because it's so goofy looking and this one like
02:02:00 a hundred thousand memes of that show oh the old one with like the them pointing at each other
02:02:06 yeah that's where it's just the funniest he's just I just love him that's where the song came from
02:02:13 right spider man I didn't know yeah maybe it's where it's from I it's probably the first spider man
02:02:20 media that is has vision like audio so probably yeah yeah yeah probably um very funny uh yeah it's
02:02:30 pretty good uh I guess I watched the tobey maguire movies or I watched like two of them and I I guess
02:02:37 those were pretty good those are my close second tobey maguire spider man I don't think I've seen
02:02:44 any other spider man movies than the tobey maguire like the first two tobey maguire ones
02:02:51 saw the one with the goblin the one with doc ock oh you didn't see the third one where he does the
02:02:56 funny like venom dance no I don't is venom in that one venom and sand man are in that one
02:03:04 no I didn't see that one no so uh I've seen the the meme the scene of him like being all emo or
02:03:11 whatever and like being all cocky yeah it's fun yeah yeah it seemed funny seemed funny
02:03:20 seemed like one of those scenes seemed like a scene kind of like the laughing scene from
02:03:25 final fantasy 10 that's awkward on purpose and like they clearly made it awkward on purpose
02:03:31 but people point to it and laugh at it as though it's like awkward by accident you know what I mean
02:03:38 uh I think so I feel like people make fun of that people made fun of that scene of tobey
02:03:44 maguire like strutting around looking like quote unquote cool as though it's not obvious that he's
02:03:52 meant to look like a doofus yeah to people yeah it's because of the way people react to him in the
02:03:58 film is like oh they're embarrassed about what he's doing and he's like oh yeah it's like it's
02:04:04 clearly not a good feeling that look I feel like I've seen people talk about like how the movie was
02:04:10 cringe or that scene is cringe because like well it's supposed to be cringe I guess it's cringe
02:04:17 that yeah like he's being cringy but he thinks he's not and that's the cringy part but not not
02:04:22 from a filmmaking perspective I feel like I've seen people thinking that it's that it's that way by
02:04:28 accident I don't know I think I like tobey maguire a lot because the peter parker nerd aspect of that
02:04:39 performance is much more believable the other guy is like Andrew Garfield and the new guy
02:04:46 tom holland they they look like pretty boys they look like like they're like they could be like
02:04:53 jocks peter parker tobey maguire looks like a doofus and that's great he does look like a doofus
02:04:59 a little bit I mean he's handsome he's handsome but like that the performance but he makes a he makes
02:05:04 a goofy face yeah he's good at that he's good at looking like a goofy guy I mean that's a that's
02:05:12 a talent okay the next one uh there's an image but there's also a voicemail okay let's listen listen
02:05:21 to the wasn't a voicemail three two one go how do I send a link how do I send a link I guess you

02:05:36 however failing to complete a step kills three other people will you not participate and let
02:05:44 three times as many people die or will you show me your dance of death okay so it's dance dance
02:05:52 revolution with buses and the people as like the you did it so you have to do a dance and as you
02:06:00 murder people and keep up with the dance properly otherwise more people will die this this is just
02:06:08 this is just the trolley problem ethically speaking this is just the trolley problem but it's dancing
02:06:13 instead of pulling a lever so yeah I guess I guess you gotta dance yeah I guess sorry I guess I dance

02:13:52 Kind of cute. Glad you enjoyed yourself. All over our damn podcast. I'm sure a two-year-old
02:14:01 you would be thrilled to know that maybe 2,000 people would hear that. That's if
02:14:10 everyone listens all the way to the end. Questionable. Next voicemail is called
02:14:17 what the fuck Texas three two one go. Texas. Yeah it's about that Texas is past
02:14:28 yeah a lot of some anti-trans legislation which is it like I think it
02:14:35 mandates or at least makes it very much encouraged to out trans children to the
02:14:43 authorities or to their parents if like a person at school teacher knows that
02:14:51 they're trans they have to or a medical professional I it's some it's some
02:14:56 bullshit to like get trans children like cured from their transness by parents who
02:15:06 would want them to go to like conversion therapy camp you know that sort of a
02:15:10 thing really stupid I haven't really looked into the specifics excellent but
02:15:15 it is it is very like like explicitly anti-trans and there's nobody likes it I
02:15:22 don't know how it my plan my plan is working perfectly I'm passing all this
02:15:29 anti-trans legislation to kill Trixie the golden with in Texas oh fuck you mother fucker
02:15:42 oh shit well better luck next time okay yeah I heard about that I also heard is
02:15:57 this is it related to I think it's not just Texas but a bunch of states have
02:16:02 passed up some quote-unquote don't say gay oh yeah something something like they're
02:16:08 like like no books that have like gay people in them yeah it's it's like it's
02:16:15 like state-approved like book burning of queer like yeah sure and and it's
02:16:22 insane goddamn goddamn political correctness am I right goddamn cancel
02:16:28 culture strikes again am I right we got a fight cancel culture with am I right
02:16:34 my fellow base base red-pilled disaffected liberals yeah that seems pretty
02:16:44 bad yeah hopefully it doesn't happen oh no it's okay okay yeah everyone's fucked
02:16:56 up all right undo it but I don't all right anything hopefully hopefully they
02:17:02 don't actually like like do it though hopefully they just kind of like I've
02:17:07 seen at least one article of something bad happening as a result of the bill
02:17:11 being passed already hmm I don't like it when bad things happen no no no no I'm
02:17:18 I'm against those as a rule I I just want to but I just want to make my stance
02:17:25 perfectly clear on bad things as a trans woman I think bad things are terrible
02:17:31 terrible things are even worse as a cis man I acknowledge that bad things are
02:17:37 terrible but but who am I to say really but but but but but nuclear war is actually
02:17:48 very survivable when you you know yeah did you see that guy on Twitter there
02:17:57 was some guy on Twitter who had a thread about how like nuclear war is actually
02:18:01 pretty survivable you just got to start preparing for it I guess he sorted
02:18:06 there's sort of a point to be made there it's sort of true but also like to what
02:18:10 end are you saying that I guess there is a certain there was a certain strain
02:18:17 there was a certain strain of liberal at the moment that is hysterical over the
02:18:25 Ukraine stuff to the point that they are like we should just we should just start
02:18:30 nuclear war like we should just do nuclear war against Russia it's gonna it's
02:18:34 gonna happen anyway why delay the inevitable we got to take them out like
02:18:39 there's just no other solution I mean I agree that he should be taken out but
02:18:44 like it's so much simpler to like keep the sanctions in place and let Russia
02:18:51 just starve itself out of all its money because it's not like economically in a
02:18:56 very good position already yeah it could not the funny thing about like the
02:19:02 the invasion is that it very much felt like Putin wanted to end it by just
02:19:09 posturing and like bluffing about an invasion and hoping that they would back
02:19:14 down and you know not talk with NATO Ukraine should not talk with NATO and
02:19:18 if you do will invade and NATO was like a fuck you hey what are you doing and
02:19:24 like Putin was like okay I've made the threat they've called my bluff I guess
02:19:30 I'll just have to do the invasion and he's like the the initial invasion force
02:19:35 was really under like prepared to go in yeah it feels like it was a bluff that
02:19:42 just got out of hand I feel like we'll stop them more than actual like combat
02:19:49 we don't need to start doing any of that stuff I watched I watched oh a video
02:19:56 another video by Patrick Boyle the finance guy he had a video about like
02:20:02 sank the sanctions on Russia and about like yeah I guess they had he said that
02:20:09 the war is costing them like 20 billion dollars a day and that like most of their
02:20:16 money was in like overseas like most of Russia's like monetary assets were in
02:20:21 like some of it was in Russia some of it was in China so that's safe from
02:20:26 sanctions but like like two-thirds of it is like overseas and has now been frozen
02:20:32 and they can't get it and they only have maybe like a few hundred billion
02:20:38 dollars left yeah and like they just they just can't keep doing it unless they
02:20:46 get some more money they'll keep like the the war going until they literally can't
02:20:51 pay for it anymore they may take over Ukraine but they will not be able to
02:20:55 like hold it for any significant length of time to do anything I feel like they're
02:21:00 going to like posture they're they're gonna threat like if you dare do
02:21:07 anything we'll we got nukes you know and it's like oh shit they got nukes but
02:21:14 like they do they do got nukes though they're gonna like run out of like money
02:21:19 to launch the nukes they're gonna press the nuke button well there are no power
02:21:24 left no like we can't we have no money to buy batteries to power the nuke
02:21:31 launcher though it's it's like whether or not nukes are fired is really just
02:21:36 down to whether Putin is like sane or not and we don't really know that but
02:21:41 like in terms of like going to war with them like actually with our own stuff
02:21:47 that would warrant nukes being used by Russia which would end the world
02:21:54 wait like if we like if we use nukes on them you're saying that if we started using nukes or
02:21:58 even just like missiles and Russia would have more of a reason to actually use their nukes
02:22:04 but right now when they're just doing a little invasion it's just that you know we do a little
02:22:10 we be doing a little invading little we do a little invading we do a little invading we do
02:22:14 a little blowing up of civilian hospitals and stuff I mean I mean you gotta break a few eggs
02:22:21 you gotta break a few eggs to kill a few chickens you know yes yes so but like nukes
02:22:29 from Russia's perspective are such a wild like it's it's literally just a suicide button they
02:22:35 would not add like advantage Russia in the the invasion they would just cause retaliation and
02:22:43 world like apocalypse so like Putin would have to be actually insane to do a nuke
02:22:50 unless he was being physically attacked by like an army in which case he might actually do it
02:22:57 maybe so today's it seems like sensible responses just keep the sanctions on until he runs out of
02:23:05 money I mean until he until he retreats that is boy gosh I mean damn though like can you imagine if
02:23:16 they just started firing nukes like can you fucking imagine I could imagine I guess I probably would
02:23:24 be dead very soon after I hear about it because I do you think London might be a target London
02:23:33 yeah London might be a target I mean I mean I mean you know I'm a bit it's a bit uh I guess
02:23:42 it depends on like what kind of bomb it is I wonder about this like like if they nuked
02:23:47 Boston like am I like close enough to this to the center of the city that like I would be
02:23:53 would I be vaporized would I be like you know would I get a would I get fall out like what
02:23:59 what would the impact on me be the uh for instance Boston was nuked I watched a video in my recommendations
02:24:07 the curse cuz I video about what if you were nuked yeah it was years old so it was like everyone
02:24:13 damn that's what I want to know that's exactly what I want to know is you watch that video
02:24:16 yeah I mean fine it's it's it's graphic but it's like informative so you will you will learn uh
02:24:24 what I mean because I know because I like it's like it's not like everybody in uh you know uh
02:24:30 Hiroshima and Nagasaki like died I mean a lot of people did but like a lot of the city was just
02:24:38 was like damaged but it wasn't it wasn't like completely like craterized you know no I mean
02:24:45 there's a part in the middle where you will be turned to atoms and after that yeah there's like the
02:24:51 wind uh the air pressure would like knock houses down and then the mushroom cloud would go up and
02:24:57 then the wind would be sucked back in so another like shock wave would go back and then also before
02:25:04 the wind there would be like a heat wave so things that could catch on fire within a large
02:25:09 radius would just spontaneously catch fire you might not die from that but like your skin would
02:25:16 burn like in like a like a sunburn like instantly Jesus and then after that there would be there
02:25:23 would potentially catch fire that would burn your skin right it would burn your skin it would be
02:25:28 your clothes would be on fire um Jesus Christ it's like a it's a nightmare and then after that um
02:25:35 there would be very little potential for aid for a very long time after like all of the because
02:25:44 you can't get not because of that I mean infrastructure would be damaged a roads would
02:25:49 be blocked people would be trying to get like um and helicopters can't really come any can't really
02:25:55 get that close for a while so you would have to like walk out of the city you mean for like days
02:26:02 uh could be days could be months I mean I can't remember exactly what they say but watch the
02:26:08 video it's it's good and scary maybe I will yeah maybe I will uh I feel like if London the center
02:26:15 London was nuked I would not be hit because I'm in the suburbs but I would definitely uh probably
02:26:21 get radiation poisoning afterwards and everything would be terrible forever hold on let me see
02:26:29 let me just uh I'm just I'm just curious I'm gonna see like how far am I how far am I from like the
02:26:36 the center of downtown Boston let me just let me just get a quick uh quick uh quick idea here
02:26:43 okay uh where am I type my address in here
02:26:52 uh two that's 2 000 feet that's one mile that's that's okay I'm maybe like
02:27:02 I'm maybe like four miles like three or four miles out from like central downtown Boston
02:27:10 I don't know what do you think that means for my odds I can't remember the the the
02:27:17 the thing in the video what are they what was that like a radius of about they yeah they don't
02:27:24 put it on screen they talk about it like they say of a radius of about something something
02:27:29 miles would be this then this radius would be even it would be radiation there would be like
02:27:37 black rain black like toxic rain I think can happen like in like s uh rose grim dark when she
02:27:45 gets the in Homestuck and and it's like it's the toxic particles from the explosion radioactive
02:27:54 would get turned into like sooty like black rain which would come down and just you know
02:28:00 infect you with radiation it would be terrible reading yeah I was reading like
02:28:07 I did read a little I think it was like a government uh instruction thing about like
02:28:12 what to do if they're if a nuke happens and they said like number one like get inside
02:28:19 stay inside if you were outside uh first thing to do take your clothes off get rid of your clothes
02:28:25 wash your clothes take a shower get any like residue off of you it's like a priority number one
02:28:31 yeah uh assuming that like water mains have not been burst and you actually have water
02:28:37 yeah true yeah true uh geez that is actually kind of a big if now that you mention it it's it's like
02:28:46 the the the the damage to infrastructure is not just like the roads will be inaccessible it's like
02:28:52 power will be out water might be not running and people might like die of thirst before anything
02:28:59 else jeez if they're stuck in a city in between like in rubble and and all that
02:29:08 you got to be very far away from a nuke to not instantly feel the effects
02:29:12 that's hold on how far is safe from a nuke how far is safe from a nuclear bomb the moon
02:29:24 okay damage zones after a nuclear oh god oh hey no this is great this is not great
02:29:34 oh this is no this is lovely no this is one well uh well actually
02:29:42 no here this is what i wanted check check check check check check this shit out check this shit out
02:29:48 i'm checking it here i posted it uh okay so it depends on the kilotonnage of the of the the um
02:29:58 the payload obviously so for a 10 looks like for a 10 kiloton bomb i would be
02:30:09 i would be nukes or just bonds
02:30:13 uh well i mean this is from a website for uh damage zones after damage zones after a nuclear
02:30:19 here i'll post the website damage zones after a nuclear detonation idealize maps
02:30:25 so yeah for a 10 kiloton bomb i would be either in the light damage zone or just maybe just
02:30:35 out outside of it that would be on the like on the periphery of that that that coveted light
02:30:43 damage zone baby why is all right i'm trying to find sites and they're like saying um you can't
02:30:54 read our site we don't want you to so i left
02:30:59 wait i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna do oh you you get pay walled not pay walled it was just
02:31:08 sort of like uh we're just we're just being stupid right now uh okay hold on i'm gonna
02:31:15 i'm gonna i'm gonna find out exactly i'm gonna find out exactly how uh how far this is this is
02:31:22 gonna be great yeah i'm about three i'm like three and three quarter miles three almost four
02:31:30 miles so i'm like right on the outer edge of a the periphery of a 10 kiloton light damage zone so
02:31:37 i'm good light light light damage who cares about all that all that might happen is like all your
02:31:48 windows will explode that ain't nothing okay okay let's hear it light damage zone are you are you
02:31:56 reading uh what it's describing here let me let me go to the here i'll read it out loud light
02:32:01 damage zone damage is caused by shocks similar to those produced by a thunderclap or sonic boom
02:32:07 but with much more force although some windows may be broken over 10 miles away the injury associated
02:32:12 with flying glass will generally occur at over pressures above 0.5 psi what this damage may correspond
02:32:21 to a distance of about three miles from ground zero okay so maybe there could be some injury from
02:32:29 broken glass from ground zero for a 10 kiloton nuclear explosion damage in this area will be
02:32:34 highly variable as shock waves rebound multiple times off of buildings the terrain and even the
02:32:39 atmosphere as a responder moves inwards windows and doors will be blown in and gutters window
02:32:43 shutters roofs lightly constructed buildings will have increasing damage litter and rebel will
02:32:47 increasingly move towards ground zero there will be increasing number of stalled and crashed
02:32:51 automobiles that will make emergency vehicle passage difficult blast over pressures that
02:32:55 characterize the light damage zone are calculated about 0.5 at psi at the outer boundary this is
02:33:01 not that descriptive all it's just saying is that yeah maybe some windows will be broken
02:33:06 probably not many but yeah no shit more windows will be broken as you move closer to the damage
02:33:12 zone thanks for explaining that for me just pre-break your windows
02:33:20 so yeah might have some broken windows
02:33:25 but would there be fallout it might depend on like the wind like it might depend on like the
02:33:33 way the wind is blowing I mean there was a little bit of a scare earlier about Chernobyl
02:33:40 because Russia like took Chernobyl area and like Chernobyl like spread when it when it
02:33:48 melted down you know way back when that happened like it was like radioactive dust
02:33:55 flew all over Europe and that was just that was just a power plant that wasn't even a bomb
02:34:00 yeah so like the dust from a bomb a nuclear explosion in Boston depending on on how nukes
02:34:10 spread that around I would imagine the dust would spread all over the US depending on wind patterns
02:34:17 and then yeah I mean all over the east coast probably yeah hmm no I'm sure it wouldn't cause
02:34:25 any problems no it'd be fine talk about 9-11 talk about uh this would be this would be way cooler
02:34:37 than 9-11 if they knew if they knew this is depressing uh I mean they're probably not I mean
02:34:46 they're probably not gonna do that they're probably not but like we can't know that until the future
02:34:52 they're probably there's probably not gonna be nuclear war you know probably not an
02:34:57 gonna be nuclear war if there was I feel like Boston is not the highest priority target like
02:35:04 what are the odds they would target Boston out of all places I mean probably not the highest
02:35:09 not the lowest either it's probably like maybe eighth or ninth down the list
02:35:16 Washington DC New York City uh Los Angeles probably not that's more of an entertainment hub than
02:35:25 anything else uh I guess well actually I mean if they're going for the east coast
02:35:32 actually Boston would probably be like yeah pretty high up on the list but why would they go for
02:35:39 the east coast why not the west coast um okay well the thing I think about is like
02:35:49 there's there's no use worrying in your day-to-day about nuclear Armageddon because
02:35:56 uh like I I don't think you could really do anything about it you could you could maybe prep
02:36:04 for it I guess you could fill your bathtub with water then slurp it out when when the time comes
02:36:12 I'm I mean yeah that's right that's correct I don't know it's not to like act like it's not
02:36:22 going to happen but to not like stress out over it because yeah I mean maybe it'll be sure I mean
02:36:32 I can't do anything about it
02:36:39 I don't know I don't know okay well I feel like we've covered this
02:36:44 I feel like we've said all there is to be said about nuclear Armageddon
02:36:49 the PCP is your premier source of news and in fact you don't need any other coverage
02:36:57 than what we offer you right here uh the next next uh voicemail oh sorry I skipped one whatever
02:37:05 this one's called farmers have no standards three two one go dudes if you want to have like confirmation
02:37:14 that kiwi farmers have no moral standards then look no further it's been saying its own thread
02:37:19 people are literally defending Trixie over the fact that Ben is profiting off the blue rays
02:37:24 therefore her work and clearly avoiding the fact that she's spent like half a decade procrastinating
02:37:29 on making the blue rays and failed delivery on other quick start of promises yeah pretty wicked
02:37:34 stuff so continue to buy more blue rays off of Ben when Trixie fun weeks through mode it'd be totally
02:37:39 hilarious the the yeah kiwi farms will it's funny because obviously like in Trixie's thread
02:37:48 they hate Trixie they'll say whatever they'll say mean things but then in in my thread which
02:37:56 has not updated in a while it's been dead for like quite a while uh but yeah like it in any given
02:38:03 person's thread they'll just say they'll say bad things about so-and-so and they'll do they'll do
02:38:10 they'll do whatever they have to do they'll praise whoever else they they need to in order to make
02:38:15 the person that they're here to hate on look bad they they'll just they're just there to hate uh
02:38:21 which is you know i guess that's more like wiwi farms more you know i'm glad somebody said
02:38:32 more like wiwi yeah that's good um so uh yeah pretty cringe pretty cringe
02:38:43 uh um dur uh anyway uh right the one that i skipped is called
02:38:51 the one that i skipped is called i just i posted it sorry i'm dumb it's called
02:38:58 nicola tesla was right it will transform your entire dna three two one go oh no a tone
02:39:06 yep there it goes what am i now it's okay because what i've already fucked my dna up
02:39:17 all those all those spike proteins already i get more or less chromosomes that's what i want to know
02:39:22 okay i'm more i'm more covet than men uh you got more i hope i got more chromosomes so i can be like
02:39:30 the like ancient egyptians that were like 30 feet tall and that's why they built statues that size
02:39:34 because they were life-size because they had no chromosomes that's why they built the pyramids
02:39:38 they just picked up the bricks and put them down yeah they were just really big they were just
02:39:43 building they were just trying to build like a chair but then they were like uh but let's just
02:39:47 make it pointy on top i guess just because it's funny but where's the giant egyptian skulls and
02:39:54 skeletons well they went such this well they went back to the home home they're either in
02:40:01 atlantis or they went back to the home planet of the hebrus or they were uh they joined satan in
02:40:07 when they did the lucifer experiment or you know there's don't ask stupid questions there's reasons
02:40:12 for all these things uh uh maybe maybe just thinks has like a giant skeleton inside it
02:40:19 oh he's he's hold he's holding all the giant bones yeah all the giant bones are in there
02:40:25 if only there were some way to dig through solid rock alas we'll never know uh the next one
02:40:37 oh shit well there's an image but there's also a uh a whatever voicemail it will transform your
02:40:44 entire dna wow the 528 hertz frequency we found the magic frequency oh here it is
02:40:55 crazy 528 hertz this whole time wow nobody's done that before that this the hertz they just
02:41:01 haven't tried that one who who would have guessed all this time i've been blasting 528 hertz
02:41:11 over the airwaves i didn't even know it was going to transform all this dna that's crazy
02:41:17 all right let's listen to the voicemail three two one go
02:41:23 eww
02:41:36 okay okay cool thanks next voicemail is called nomar club uh print from shitty dating advice
02:41:46 at oldpcp.com yes we remember when we used to sometimes give dating advice that was funny
02:41:52 that was pretty epic yeah that was it was amazing it's just every once in a while we gotta we gotta
02:41:59 bring it back uh okay next one yeah no uh three two one go hey what's up guys sorry i haven't made
02:42:09 a voicemail in a while or ever and i started listening around retcon 4 and uh although i
02:42:16 catch that with basically all the backlog i still haven't heard the lore about bansaint being the king
02:42:22 of fives how about that oh and uh if you feel like going into it i was dating for you how was
02:42:30 all the past couple of years going and all and before that do you concern yourselves with portal
02:42:37 trifos like dating and like do you even care the king of fives thing that was like a
02:42:44 joke that a friend made about me because i guess he thought that all the girls i was
02:42:50 seeing at the time back then i guess he just didn't think they were very attractive oh i get it yeah
02:42:57 but you know that guy i i mean um i'll i'll just say it that guy that guy's a chubby chaser that
02:43:03 guy only likes fat girls so i mean you know different strokes for different folks i guess
02:43:09 i don't know if i don't know if i don't know if we i don't know if everybody would agree with
02:43:13 his assessment but that's okay he's entitled to his opinion uh it's fine you know i'm not gonna
02:43:19 judge i'm i don't judge him i don't know why he had to fucking do me like that but okay it's ah
02:43:27 my heart ah okay um cramp anyway um dating is bad and i haven't done it uh in a while uh listen
02:43:37 i'm making my masterpiece all right making my masterpiece i got no time for trifling
02:43:45 okay no time for trifling can't let bitches get me down uh
02:43:51 uh man i was thinking man some people
02:43:59 some people like have a conversation about like what are we gonna eat today
02:44:05 some people do that like every day like with their with like with their girlfriend whatever
02:44:09 with their their husband or whatever some people talk about that all the time
02:44:15 um can you imagine i well i guess so but uh wouldn't be that much to imagine i don't
02:44:22 know why i would bother imagining it i just um just glad i don't have i'm just glad i don't
02:44:28 have to do it i'm glad i don't have to like have a conversation about it i'm glad i'm just glad
02:44:36 you know i kind of i like i kind of like i like being in control of my own destiny i like that i
02:44:42 don't have to uh worry about like another like what another person's doing or what they're eating
02:44:48 or what just for instance what they're eating i just have my shit in the fridge and i just go
02:44:52 to the fridge and i eat it and i don't have to think about anything else i have no other considerations
02:45:01 and that's good that's how i like it uh so that's what i think about dating
02:45:06 uh the food the food the food concerns are just too pressing i can't deal with it
02:45:13 um dating is a scary um yeah i don't feel like i uh i'm cool
02:45:23 women therefore bad women are bad and they should they should leave me alone
02:45:30 uh that was a joke uh that was joke that's just i'm not actually
02:45:36 such an it's a joke i'm actually even such anistic um sorry sorry women women listen
02:45:43 late ladies sorry i'm i'm so sorry you have it so you have it so rough already and i'm just
02:45:50 and i'm just making it even worse for you uh i i shit is there anything else to say about that
02:45:57 i don't know uh what's the app tinder i hate it that's my opinion on dating just makes me sad
02:46:05 just makes me depressed looking through that i haven't i haven't looked at it in a while you know
02:46:09 i have like i have like a shit i think i might have had like a renewed a subscription to it or
02:46:15 whatever uh this past year without even noticing because i just wasn't paying attention uh i have
02:46:21 like that i haven't looked at it in a long time uh there was a time when i used it a few years ago
02:46:32 to pretty decent success and then i don't i don't know if i changed or the app changed
02:46:39 but then like i tried using it again uh maybe a year or two ago and it was like total total
02:46:49 failure like i definitely heard of like like because the whole point of their business model
02:46:56 is that people are lonely and they stay alone so you have to pay out the ass to get like actual
02:47:03 matches um yeah and they've just increased that aspect of the app more and more well i well i did
02:47:10 like okay i'll say it yeah i did i remember you did but like like have you did that was the last
02:47:16 time you did it were you paying that was the yeah the last no the first time when i was using it for
02:47:21 free it was when it worked oh and it was fine yeah and then two years two years ago i put some money
02:47:28 about two years or something like that i put some money into it whatever i got like a premium membership
02:47:33 i i got some super likes or whatever whatever bullshit i think i paid like maybe 70 for like a
02:47:40 year subscription or something you know whatever yeah pretty lame but whatever i did it uh and
02:47:46 it just it just i just i just i think i got nothing and it's just and it uh and i was just uh
02:47:54 i swear it used to work i swear i used to get results on it and then the site when i went
02:47:58 back to it just nothing just i don't know i have no i don't know why i have no again i don't know
02:48:05 if i changed or the app changed or what uh hobo fuck hobo was my fault i like to think it's not
02:48:13 my fault um yeah i don't know i don't know about that anyway i haven't thought anyway that was
02:48:19 disheartening and i haven't thought about it in a while uh yeah okay next one is no voicemail
02:48:29 just an image these i like these fish these pog fish like mud no no watch average ben enjoyer
02:48:40 yeah just coming out of that out of them out of the mud yeah out of the slime yeah he's he's he
02:48:47 knows what's up these these two idiots these two idiots are just uh they wouldn't know
02:48:55 quality content if it uh if it fucked him in the air uh and so it will right now uh anyway
02:49:09 next voicemail is called comrad discount uh let me get that right here
02:49:17 there it is okay three two one go hello comrades nicole i would like to buy a copy of
02:49:24 road to red gun however nicole i do have a lot of money because nicole i buy lots of vodka
02:49:29 so nicole i would like to know nicole i get comrad bonus or comrad discount for nicole
02:49:36 is nicole comrad let nicole i know um i mean i don't care uh if you make me a funny
02:49:54 if you send me if you send me a message or an email that's funny enough
02:49:58 yeah i'll probably give you i'll probably send you one for a discount yeah whatever i don't care
02:50:03 that much i'll give you like ten bucks off just pay for shipping whatever i don't care uh but uh
02:50:10 just make an effort honestly if honestly if uh yeah when people ask me like hey uh i can't uh
02:50:17 i kind of like don't want to like pay a full price like can i get a discount i'm usually just like
02:50:21 yeah fine you know because i because like most people don't want to most people wouldn't bother
02:50:29 if you're if you want the thing enough if you want the thing enough
02:50:33 that you're coming and asking me for it but you're a kind of like embarrassing yourself like

02:53:09 you've forced my hand okay three two one go since you couldn't understand my one dollar mic
02:53:19 i became a cyborg to output clean mp3 files okay enjoy the recording of police report
02:53:24 i happened to intercept with my aunt tenney so why did you break into this house the owner is
02:53:31 beyond poverty there is nothing to steal they are even churning cards that's how bad it is
02:53:36 churning cards is what rich people do actually what do you see an attractive female with unusually
02:53:42 large breasts this isn't female this is ben saint the owner of this house i couldn't stop thinking
02:53:48 about this picture ben saint with large mommy milkers so i've been sneaking into his house for
02:53:54 last few months and added estrogen into his sparkling water what is a noble goal you are free to go
02:54:00 young man uh what do i think i think uh there's a lot uh going on here all sides make some good
02:54:12 excellent points um you know what speaking of sparkling water let me grab one out of my little
02:54:20 mini fridge sure it would be nice if it was as easy as that just put a little e into into some water
02:54:26 hey by the way i don't know if that guy maybe is listening but this is the mini fridge that a guy
02:54:33 bought me after i uh won noida on twitch that one time uh so if that guy who bought me a mini
02:54:42 fridge for beating noida is listening uh thanks for the mini fridge dude crazy yeah uh that was
02:54:51 crazy man it's how often do you stream these days gibb like occasionally yeah just occasionally i
02:55:00 streamed like twice in a row the other day i saw you tweeting that you were you were gonna be streaming
02:55:06 yeah uh i think uh probably not streaming ever is probably a big mistake for me because like
02:55:16 you know sometimes people would watch it and sometimes people would get excited and sometimes
02:55:21 people would do things like pledge me some money or buy me a mini fridge uh and that was pretty crazy
02:55:27 i feel like by i feel like i might gain here's it's like like 80 20 rule i feel like maybe i would
02:55:35 gain you know 80 percent of the benefits of streaming if i streamed maybe 20 percent as much
02:55:42 like me if i just maybe did a stream like once a month maybe people would appreciate it yeah of
02:55:48 course whereas so it's probably it's probably stupid that i that i never do it like on my channel
02:55:55 i mean when i when i stream a lot of the time i don't really know what to play yeah and then
02:56:02 i'm doing it and i'm like oh there's technical problems oh it's it's oh i don't know what to
02:56:08 say it's like it's it's not always some part of it feels like it could be nice and and relaxing
02:56:14 and just chilling out but i get i get a little worked up about like people enjoying it or not
02:56:21 when i really shouldn't yeah probably just enjoy yourself and then people will
02:56:29 hopefully enjoy it as well along with you i mean no noida is like the only game that i play anymore
02:56:34 like the these days uh so i mean i guess i was gonna stream a game it would probably just be
02:56:41 yeah i've been playing like Animal Crossing Pocket Camp which is a mobile game it's not something
02:56:47 to stream not that i would figure out i would know how to stream it from my phone and then the other
02:56:53 thing i've been filling my time with is solitaire online and it's like what a stupid set of things
02:57:00 that i'm constantly doing uh surely i surely could be playing like some cool thing for people to
02:57:06 talk about possibly possibly i should never feel like we'll never know we'll never know yeah um
02:57:18 i i don't know maybe i'll change my life around in some way after i finish slime and punishment
02:57:27 or maybe not guess we'll see uh anyway next voicemail is called gib good wow
02:57:36 three wow three two one go so anyway it's kind of unfair that bin gets all the attention gib
02:57:45 you are cutie and that game demo is pretty pog thanks always wanted to chuck useless liberal
02:57:51 zoomers with their iPhones at collectibles as anarcho communist spitting literal fire
02:57:57 you fulfilled my childhood dream thank you hell yeah you're welcome this reminds me uh i meant
02:58:07 i'm curious i was curious i was gonna say this after uh the first voicemail from uh marowak
02:58:14 uh about collecting all the fairy bits how i wonder how long it takes most people i feel
02:58:21 like as i was looking for those last bits a long time i feel like i was dumb the last bits that i
02:58:28 found it took me about two hours to get the last ones and the last ones that i found were in a cave
02:58:34 that were at the beginning they were near the beginning of the game so i had you said that
02:58:39 yeah i had missed an early secret and then i just it took me a long time to go back and fit and find
02:58:44 it again because i had those like so i yeah i've been i've been looking at like people's playthroughs
02:58:50 and and stuff if you by the way if anyone wants to like record a video uh playing the game i will
02:58:56 watch it because i need to know what people like tend to do when they're playing the game for the
02:59:02 first time uh good good good research potentially yeah yeah for sure because a lot of people do see
02:59:09 that after a second um but some people do just what past it it is sort of you mean that secret
02:59:16 that secret yeah i completely completely didn't even notice any damn thing she's gotta be super
02:59:26 smart that's what you gotta do unfortunately gib the the covid brain fog reduced my iq point by
02:59:33 exactly the one point that made the difference unfortunately it uh yeah i failed my uh my spot
02:59:40 check well this game is not for you there's no easy mode no i lost i lost the game i mean i i beat it
02:59:54 but i i beat it like bad so i lost the way to the way to lose the game is to beat it oh i didn't
03:00:02 find the last lizard or no there's more lizards there's more lizards there's more lizards than the
03:00:08 ones you found has anyone found uh i don't know has anyone found the most lizards i i haven't seen
03:00:18 posts about it uh so i don't think so i don't think anyone's found steel viper steel viper
03:00:25 showed me the red lizard she was like hey i found this lizard and then didn't tell me where well you
03:00:32 go to play the game you go to find it i told her where i found my god damn lizards oh oh well uh

03:07:51 oh my god i'm like a ben saying stream damn i guess i could just i guess i could just stream it
03:07:57 huh because it would be like so old and everyone would be backseat gaming it's like i can't believe
03:08:03 ben saying doesn't know what he's doing true um fascinating a fascinating proposal uh hey you
03:08:16 want to know what's making me sad right now what what's making me sad right now gib is that last night
03:08:24 i got hungry and i ate and i ate half my calories for the day after midnight before i went to sleep
03:08:33 ain't that ain't that just uh ain't that just tragic don't that just make you cry so you can't
03:08:39 eat anything or like you can only i can eat a bit i can eat uh yeah i i can eat like uh like
03:08:46 500 more calories left which is not that much do the rest of the day i'm gonna have like a big
03:08:54 like chicken nugget mcdonald's delivery i just need a big chicken nugget party sometimes you just
03:09:00 need it you know what if i'd save my calories like a good boy i could have a big chicken mcnugget
03:09:06 party but uh unfortunately you know what i'm not even that sad i have a great i actually have a great uh
03:09:14 because i've i've uh my i've found all the best things to buy i make uh i make wraps now i'm
03:09:20 making uh i'm making sandwich wraps with low-carb tortillas these wraps that i'm making they're
03:09:28 like 150 calories a piece i can eat so many wraps in a day i can eat so many wraps it's crazy
03:09:35 it's amazing it's great uh and they're delicious i love them uh i just wish
03:09:41 all the only thing i could ask for is i could eat even more but alas it's so strange to hear
03:09:47 ben sainte say he loves like a carbohydrate and does not specify that it is a keto version well
03:09:54 no they okay but they are actually it's low it's low-carb uh it's low-carb tortillas okay it's just
03:10:01 it's just that i'm not eating them specifically because they're low-carb it i'm eating them because
03:10:06 they are low calorie as well it's like 40 calories per wrap which is like it's nothing it's nothing
03:10:12 they're so filling it's delightful um what was i talking about that was totally off topic uh anyway
03:10:22 uh yeah i ate i got wait no i'm on the tangent so i'm going on it i finally i finally got uh
03:10:30 fucking hana ferds hana ferds always says that they're in stock from all these weird flavors
03:10:37 of one of my uh my new ice creams my new low low calorie ice creams nix nix ice cream they always
03:10:44 say they have cherry chocoflaka they always say they have rocky fjord they always say they have
03:10:52 swedish munchies they always say they have swedish apple pie flavor they never do they don't have
03:10:58 any of that shit they're lying so i finally i ordered from wegmans and they did have cherry
03:11:06 chocoflaka they did have rocky fjord they didn't have the other ones but that's okay and i got them
03:11:15 and they were great they were too good so i ate them last night and now i only have 500 calories
03:11:21 left for my whole day and that's she's tearing me up she's tearing me up this is what i this is
03:11:34 what i'm up this anyway this is this is what i'm up to these days okay next one is called uh
03:11:40 ben saint's first album there it is wait one more thing one more thing i gotta complain i gotta
03:11:50 complain more about ice cream look at listen look at this shit all right look at this shit
03:11:57 you're gonna this is gonna blow your fucking mind i sure it sure will this is going to obliterate
03:12:03 your mind all right look at this i bought some of these just because i was like i guess i'll try
03:12:09 him and just see what they're about this is from a company called dream pop plant-based dream bites
03:12:17 right yeah dream pop makes dream bites they dream pops are like a popsicle version of these
03:12:22 these are like a chocolate covered you know a little all right as you can see they don't call it corn
03:12:31 as you can see they don't call it uh ice cream they call it frozen dessert because it's plant-based
03:12:36 so you know whatever that's fine um i bought a cup of these these cost the same these cost
03:12:43 these are like five bucks for this cup it looks like it's a pint of ice cream it's not the cup is
03:12:50 small and it's like mostly air it's full of air there's only like a dozen of these fucking little
03:12:57 things in them and they're smaller than they look on the box and the final thing you see how look at
03:13:02 their shape they've got that crazy d20 ice isohedron shape well they don't fucking look like that
03:13:08 they're just little like rectangular blobs it's it's not even close and i'm like it doesn't like
03:13:17 man i was so mad i was so mad at these it was all air it was all fucking air they didn't even
03:13:24 fill the fucking cup it's not a flex that your cup of ice cream is only 300 calories when there's
03:13:32 no fucking ice cream in it bro when it's just empty dog you have not made a low calorie product
03:13:41 you have simply sold me very little products they got you they got me they tasted all right
03:13:50 they tasted pretty decent even there just wasn't there well this wasn't very much of it although
03:13:55 i will say it was kind of tart the like berry uh frozen dessert inside was kind of tart it was
03:14:02 nice with the chocolate i think the berry flavor is probably the only one that seems good because
03:14:08 i think that's sort of like sorbet flavor would be really weird with the other flavors that they
03:14:15 offer which is a birthday cake vanilla and a cookie dough i don't know i don't think that would work
03:14:21 as well with like the sorbet kind of kind of texture okay that's my that's what i have to say
03:14:29 about dream bites i would not recommend them uh no when i say dream bites i'm talking about the
03:14:38 youtuber and i don't like him is that a youtuber do you not remember dream oh yeah no yeah no yeah
03:14:50 i remember the minecraft guy he was bad he cheated at minecraft he cheated in a speed run and that's
03:15:02 bad that's bad the thing about him is is that that that animation he made where he like he he
03:15:11 treated the animators really badly and like forced them to crunch to get it finished and it looks
03:15:16 really weird yeah and he throws his weight around like he's some big hot shot because he's a big
03:15:23 subscriber he's got big subscriber uh what is it adam from why adam yms said he thinks dream
03:15:30 seems like a pathological liar and uh i think that sounds that's that rings true and i don't
03:15:37 see any reason not to believe that so uh i'm just gonna go with that yeah he seems like a psychopath
03:15:43 uh yeah uh fuck him uh next voicemail is called was the last one did we play the last one no we
03:15:56 didn't uh 79 it's called ben sains first album three two one go ben you have an amazing voice
03:16:06 you should make an album sing all your favorite songs or hell just do originals
03:16:15 ben sains sings the hits i would like i would like to uh i would like to be like a singer
03:16:21 i think i would like to maybe be in like a band i think that would be cool but i would want to sing
03:16:28 and i don't really play any instruments very well i mean i guess i could figure it out i play
03:16:34 instruments we could start a band but i wouldn't want
03:16:41 i would want to do gigs i don't know no i say that out loud but now i think about it
03:16:46 i was like oh but it'd be so embarrassing what if we weren't good what if it wasn't good
03:16:51 what if we bombed oh no oh no it's a nice idea and i could enjoy it but like
03:16:59 i'd have to be really proud of the of the of the art that i was displaying you know i wouldn't
03:17:07 just do it like with you know i wouldn't just do it like randomly that sucks well how else do you
03:17:17 do it i don't know i'm kind of talking myself out of it now uh sometimes it seems like something
03:17:24 i'd like to do but uh also i don't know if i have the commitment to such a thing to actually
03:17:30 go through with it and i mean how would i even how would you even do it anyway uh
03:17:36 you go up to a venue and you say i got a band or can we play at the thing yeah sure sure
03:17:45 but how do you get a band uh you talk to a person you go up to a person who's uh
03:17:51 standing around you say do you play an instrument do you play an instrument and eventually you'll
03:17:55 find would you would you like to play a company for accompaniment for me the star the lead singer
03:18:01 who does nothing else you write the songs and i'll just perform them thanks
03:18:07 yeah okay i knew you would like that thank you let's do it i guess i guess you just go to places
03:18:14 like open open mic nights and talk to the participants and if people say hey that was
03:18:22 really really good what you did there you do like a karaoke i'm looking for a singer in my band
03:18:31 i don't know if you know i don't know if i'm good enough i don't know if i'm a good enough
03:18:35 singer to be like a singer in a band i don't know if i have like those chops like i think i'm okay
03:18:41 but i think i'm i'm not like i'm i'm i'm okay and i don't know if that really cuts the mustard
03:18:48 uh i i then again i guess a lot of vocalists are not actually great singers you know you don't
03:18:56 necessarily you don't necessarily have to be a great singer to to be a you know i mean a to vocalize
03:19:04 a song that people like i mean famously like freddy milk mercury doesn't really have that much of
03:19:12 like a range but he's he's so good at what he does that it and it works really well for queen
03:19:18 yeah yeah i guess is that true about freddy i didn't know that but like you know i remember
03:19:23 hearing that and i guess i just believed it so maybe i'm talking out of my a s it could it could
03:19:29 be true i don't i don't know i've never i've never heard anyone say that about freddy but like maybe
03:19:33 like he's he's great and it's like i think it was some sort of singing maybe it's not range
03:19:40 i'm talking about but like in terms of like singing skill i don't know how you measure that you know
03:19:46 what yeah it's not a diss freddy mercury sounds great um i guess a better example is like uh what's
03:19:54 his face from the fucking oh ac dc oh yeah he sounds like a screeker screecher but like it works
03:20:04 so well for ac dc who's who's the i mean young or is that the other guy i don't know a lot of the
03:20:12 music lore that i know i got from a tot in the shadows videos i'm thinking of like the guy who's
03:20:18 saying um eve of destruction like that guy kind of sucks but he had a hit uh like his his voice
03:20:28 is kind of bad um same with um oh who's the guy is it bob dillon like bob dillon doesn't really
03:20:35 have much of a like his voice yeah he's a he's a songwriter more so than he is like a vocal man
03:20:41 but yeah writes really good songs right yeah you don't need to be good at anything to do
03:20:47 everything exactly that's that's my whole career in a nutshell i like i realized one day i don't
03:20:54 actually have to be good at anything just do shit and i hope it works out and you know what it did
03:21:00 it was true um well okay uh next next voicemail is called is this uh yes clearing something up
03:21:12 we have like maybe six or seven left i think oh my god uh we got yeah we got like seven left
03:21:20 okay oh i posted it twice okay clearing something up three two one go hey guys just clearing something
03:21:28 up here there's nothing you know last week when i said uke studio is dead i meant like trixie or riley
03:21:35 i meant like they're literally dead so all these shitty new content like i killed them basically
03:21:40 kill the channel i just meant like that's the idea is dead okay okay fair enough um no i meant i
03:21:48 meant i literally murdered them um next one is called the gen nine fire starter is based on a red pepper
03:21:55 three two one go
03:22:00 okay uh yeah yeah i get yeah i guess i i see i didn't realize it at first but yeah it i see it
03:22:07 it may it still makes me wonder if he's gonna be like fire grass type but i don't know people have
03:22:14 said fire ghost because ghost pepper yeah yeah that would be that would be amusing i suppose
03:22:21 i haven't done that before fire ghost yeah that'd be pretty cool um and that would mean like one of
03:22:28 the other starters would be something psychic or something dark i mean maybe people have said
03:22:34 that um the cat will be grass fairy which would be pretty cool yeah yeah is there already a grass
03:22:40 fairy pretty sure there must be some i mean so lots of fairy types look like they're grass
03:22:47 type oh whimsicott yeah whimsicott is grass fairy um i like whimsicott uh
03:22:56 and uh you know i think uh was it um was it was it izzy's tweeted that um
03:23:06 the yeah red ghost pepper guy disproves the zodiac theory but like
03:23:14 not necessarily like he could turn into like a serpent there's gonna be a zodiac killer in the
03:23:19 new pokemon game do you know about like how all the fire starties are uh are um they're animals
03:23:26 all the fire starters are animals from the chinese zodiac or they have been so far i did not know
03:23:33 that was there a cow fire um i i don't think so hold on um fire you'll see for you'll see it
03:23:45 and it'll be like oh yeah yeah totally totally true all right you know cindy quill is a little bit
03:23:51 of a stretch actually yeah it's not a mouse it's supposed to be uh like a like a bat like a badger
03:23:58 or like a like a like a like a wolverine right um i thought it had leaves uh what's the thing that
03:24:06 isn't a hedgehog it has the spines a porcupine porcupine maybe yeah i thought that the fire was
03:24:17 like spikes yeah maybe it's supposed to be like that i kind of thought it was a badger whatever it's
03:24:27 i mean it's not a rat yeah that's that's a that's a stretch that's a stretch and
03:24:34 i don't know like i could totally see this pepper thing turning into like a serpent of some kind
03:24:38 which would oh you know could you know a finnican being the dog is wrong very wrong it's like it's
03:24:50 it's like like sort of the same but like dogs and foxes are very different like if there was
03:24:56 a dog fire starter they would definitely be using that instead of finnican and then finnican would
03:25:00 go nowhere hmm are dogs are foxes not dogs they're they're like canine adjacent like it's really
03:25:14 it's it's a very superficial similarity i feel like there like pig and pig and torchic rooster
03:25:22 like those all make sense but that one's more of a stretch than i think i think i think cindy quill
03:25:29 is a bigger stretch but bigger stretch yeah but but finnican yeah anyway i'm just i'm just saying
03:25:36 i'm not sure i feel like it's completely disproved if we if we accept it thus far i feel like this
03:25:42 new one is not you know let's wait and see what the final evolution is obviously it was some kind
03:25:48 honestly if it were some kind of fire snake i think that would be pretty cool uh yeah yeah
03:25:55 okay next one is called also ben do a soul link nuzlocke and then this is three two one
03:26:05 one okay um you know i heard about soul link nuzlocke's from um cough and a frame those guys
03:26:15 from the old rfck crowd yeah marin pan chimes in about the zodiac thing the crocodile could become
03:26:23 more snake like male crocodiles are called bulls okay if that would be some real bullshit if like
03:26:32 they they tried to claim it's a bull because of some nomenclature shit so no but yeah it could
03:26:40 be snake it could be snake like um i kind of hope it does i think it's cool idea uh yeah a frame in
03:26:45 cough told me they were doing a soul link nuzlocke and i guess what that is it's two people nuzlocke
03:26:52 at the same time and they each catch a pokemon you know you each catch a pokemon on your route
03:27:00 or whatever and then your the two pokemon that you each catch on the same route are soul linked
03:27:09 and then if one of you who's dies if one of you's dies then the other one has to release
03:27:16 their linked guy so it's so it's like if somebody sucks yeah so if you're if you're a partner if
03:27:25 your soul link partner sucks you just have to fucking deal with it as well crazy um i don't know
03:27:34 i don't know if i would like it very much it's very frustrating i feel like you're doing the
03:27:39 nuzlocke and then you get a message like oh yeah you're gonna have to kill like that pokemon yeah
03:27:44 it's just i don't know it's it's just like a nuzlocke but also someone else is like fucking up
03:27:52 and and it's like ruining your day
03:28:00 i mean i guess i guess it could be fun but i'm not i feel like i feel like i would rather
03:28:06 if i was gonna make a nuzlocke harder i would just impose more restrictions on myself you know
03:28:13 i wouldn't put my fate in the hands of someone who might just completely screw me over
03:28:18 or completely randomly you know what i mean me yeah i think i would rather do that um
03:28:27 okay next one is called i'm out of breath few uh wait here it is okay three two one go
03:28:35 okay uh next one is called and the idea for the next radcon okay three two one go
03:28:56 and i got a brilliant idea for you i know you said you guys are thinking about doing radcon five
03:29:00 so if you do and you decide to do that tricksy lecture you gotta not just talk about how she
03:29:06 destroyed her channel and all that you also gotta talk about the fact that she would cry when she had
03:29:11 to pay taxes or she treated the boo like shit or anything you can think of honestly just destroy
03:29:17 her make everyone hate her completely ruin her more than she already has if i could do that
03:29:23 if i could do that i already would have i've done the best i can i can't do anymore i'm sorry
03:29:29 i'm sorry uh did i meant did i mention that thing may may told me that uh the trixie used
03:29:39 taxes yeah trixie used to cry when she would bring up taxes oh joy makes me so happy um
03:29:50 um anyway next one is called uh where was i ben talk about your shitty fucking apartment more
03:30:02 it's funny okay there's no voicemail attached to that it's just a question um well my shitty
03:30:12 fucking apartment uh it's uh okay i kind of have all right uh i think it kind of looks like a dump
03:30:24 right now and by dump i mean like it's full of trash and like it's not like dirty trash it's not
03:30:31 like food waste it's not stuff that's gonna rot or anything but there's like a big pile of boxes
03:30:38 that i've like saved there's a big there's a big like pile of like bags because like i save my i
03:30:44 save paper bags and then some of the paper bags many of them in fact uh one two three four five
03:30:52 six seven of them in fact are just kind of laying around with uh with sparkling water bottle empty
03:30:59 sparkling water bottles filling them i guess i could take them out to the recycling if i wanted
03:31:06 but i mean i've got more floor space that i'm not using so why not just fill that floor
03:31:12 space with more bags of empty sparkling water bottles you know what i mean uh yeah sure whatever
03:31:22 so you know my room is uh it sucks to begin with and i'm not doing it any favors okay that's
03:31:35 that's what i have to say about that um
03:31:40 okay the next one is a youtube link and it says seven hour video this is what i meant to say

03:31:59 oh it's whoa those tits i love those tits so much right that's the line uh i mean if it's from if
03:32:08 it's from the the piece the the plebenweeb well the blu-rays contain the plebenweeb and thus
03:32:17 all component parts of it so there uh next one is called oh this this is the last one this is a
03:32:30 new one that was that arrived five minutes ago so good job you squeaked in at the last second
03:32:36 this is called revelations dimensional merge from owo at uwu.com three two one go
03:32:50 gino samuels chris chen documentary just came back and it's at about 2017 i think in the timeline
03:32:57 not long until it touches on ben's involvement at the very least slamming punishment and the
03:33:03 war on quickbill gino samuels doesn't you know cover every piece of chris chen media that every
03:33:08 bozo put out but these might be significant and that documentary gets about 500k views on average
03:33:16 500k really that's some you know some cue reforms people but that's also a lot of normies a lot of
03:33:23 new viewership might be coming this way i don't know we're already kind of preparing for it in rck
03:33:29 and actually what do you think about that what do you think of the documentary yeah i haven't uh
03:33:34 how it handles chris three or whatever i don't know uh brocrastinator's micro server five bucks a
03:33:41 month come do it come it's good it's fun there's pokemon okay thank you buddy we have this fun we
03:33:48 we said we were gonna we were gonna stream last week i've been i've been pretty busy i'm like pushed
03:33:54 for it uh yeah i have bits just been like i have just been what i just want to finish my fucking
03:34:01 comic after i finish slamming punishment we should definitely stream or i'll want to stream for sure
03:34:10 yeah sorry uh i think that i think that was for maren pan yeah sorry i have been uh distracted
03:34:16 we will we will do more we'll hang out on the stream on the minecraft server again in a bit
03:34:22 but anyway uh i haven't watched the geno samuel documentary i haven't literally not watched any
03:34:29 of it so is that the that's the extremely long form many the one that's 78 million parts yeah the
03:34:36 one that's like 60 parts long i think it's yeah um uh i don't know if it's gonna like yeah he might
03:34:46 mention uh he might mention um slamming punishment he might mention rfck maybe i don't know how
03:34:56 in depth he goes exactly i would imagine just based on the fact that there's so much
03:35:04 like content already in the documentary that you would get at least like a sentence because
03:35:11 christian did those like drawings for the card game well she did the cards and then
03:35:19 i mean was on a video where you it talked you interviewed her or something yeah i was like
03:35:25 in the call i can't remember what that was about that was related i think to to that stuff yes it
03:35:32 was related to the the rain and all that um yeah yeah i would i would uh yeah i think i'm likely to
03:35:41 get mentioned um you know i wonder i wonder if i have the game out by then if uh maybe uh he would
03:35:51 mention the game that would be kind of neat um so like uh geez i don't know what i don't have to
03:36:02 say about it uh the the the brain fog COVID brain fog COVID i'm more COVID than man it changed my
03:36:13 whole DNA um i don't know uh it's it's gonna be uh funny uh maybe uh i mean okay the cards the cards
03:36:25 uh i don't know like has he mentioned the cards because like a lot of what chris drew okay a lot
03:36:32 of what chris drew for the slime stuff was in the form of the twilight sparkle secret ship
03:36:44 flick folder cards and like most of those cards i don't know maybe this is just my opinion but they
03:36:51 seemed like completely irrelevant like who fucking cares uh like they do have like lore on them and
03:36:57 they do have like new characters on them honestly there probably is a lot there to like unpack if
03:37:03 you really wanted to honestly hmm you know what wonder if there's a lecture idea in that now that
03:37:09 i think about it uh those there were a lot of cards and they had a lot of like information
03:37:15 that was just like why would you ever read these fucking cards uh so i feel like maybe they the the
03:37:23 slime stuff the the rfck stuff might be mentioned along the same breath as the cards and like who
03:37:31 fucking cares about the cards so i could kind of see rfc the slime and punishment getting
03:37:37 shafted a little bit like that um but i don't know maybe if i make the video game maybe gino
03:37:44 would see the video game and maybe if he was impressed maybe he might give it a some some
03:37:49 discussion in the in whenever he gets around to talking about it i don't know gino i just i kind
03:37:56 of assumed that gino was a piece of shit because like every chris chan youtuber is a fucking garbage
03:38:02 monster demon uh who i just hate with every fucking fiber of my being and i just assumed he was one
03:38:08 like that too but i've been told that he's not as bad as like the other guys so i don't know maybe
03:38:14 he's fine actually i don't know lamal
03:38:21 okay i guess that's all i have to say about that uh and that was the last voicemail
03:38:25 i want to go and eat mcnuggets so bad i guess i'll go and i'll make i can make myself a little uh
03:38:33 a little turkey turkey caesar turkey caesar uh salad wrap with a little uh some greens and tomatoes
03:38:42 oh health health food huh is it you know it's not even you know you're better than me
03:38:49 no i just you like good food huh is that how it is no no i hate it no it's gonna
03:38:56 darn i wish i had those nuggets uh
03:38:59 uh geez um nugget pressure
03:39:06 um okay yeah that's it we've yes we've done another fucking four hour
03:39:14 the demo the free demo definitely play pumpkin alley the demo if it's out by now
03:39:22 which is not entirely impossible play phantom's revenge if not play it next week
03:39:32 uh play our video games pcp the pcp stands for play our video i don't know i don't know
03:39:40 i had this idea a while ago being like doing like p3 which is like e3 but with the procrastinators
03:39:48 and then we would like have uh like a pretend like oh we're doing video games there's a big
03:39:53 announcement we're on stage you you mentioned this i don't remember if you told me about it
03:39:59 or if you said it on the show but i think yes i put it in the chat at some point
03:40:06 because like tom was doing something it's like what what if we had like trailers what if we like
03:40:10 did a big old p3 honestly i mean why not like why wouldn't we do that like we're all
03:40:18 we're we're three podcasters who all make video games now so like
03:40:26 why wouldn't we do something with that um
03:40:31 you know uh yeah uh yeah is it rebrand time is it rebrand time is it time to change the tombstone
03:40:40 into like a pixel polygon into uh well we're not like gaming isn't low resolution that's not the
03:40:48 same thing speak for yourself i don't like i don't like how video games and low res 8 bit is
03:40:55 synonymous i'm gonna find a video game gamer i do anything but pixel art i'm gonna literally kick
03:41:02 your ass super nintendo video games peaked with the super nintendo best three solvent oh no no you
03:41:09 you said super nintendo not nintendo 64 not nintendo 64 that was bad no that was that was bad
03:41:18 well yeah yeah no no well yeah well actually yeah that's because it actually peaked with the ps2
03:41:26 and that's the where the games really are should be
03:41:30 hmm yeah i don't know um uh okay whatever you know you get what i'm saying though a video game
03:41:39 theme rebrand i don't know maybe you could have uh you could be in like 16 bit i could be ps2 model
03:41:48 and tom could be a ps1 model yeah oh yeah oh yeah true uh is that does that correlate to like
03:41:58 or ages yeah i am the oldest and tom is a little bit younger than me and you are a little younger
03:42:03 than him so yeah i guess it's uh uh the three generations three generations in one image grandpa
03:42:11 father and son all together daughter oh right sorry how dare you i saw a picture well well you
03:42:24 can't mix the you can't mix genders they all have to be the same i saw a picture of eight generations
03:42:31 of women it was like old lady on the brink of death and then just a regular very old lady
03:42:40 and then a kind of old lady and then a middle-aged lady and then a sort of adult lady and then a
03:42:50 young adult lady and then a teenager and then a baby that had just been born
03:42:54 it was like eight generations in one picture it was gross i hated it so you know that's what we're
03:43:03 doing i wonder what it feels like to look at your past and and and future sucks i hate it
03:43:13 okay that's the show goodbye i'm so tired i've just lost my ability to say words goodbye
03:43:22 end of the episode patreon.com slash the procrastinators uh the end goodbye
