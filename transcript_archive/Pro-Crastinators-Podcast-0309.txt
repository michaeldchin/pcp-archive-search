00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:13 Mmmmmmmm, it's another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm starting, I guess. I guess I'm starting.
00:00:24 Another week has gone by, another week down the toilet, as always, and it's just me again.
00:00:35 But you know what? Rain or shine, neither hail nor sleet nor fog of war can stay these couriers from their appointed podcast.
00:00:48 It's episode, whatever, 309.
00:00:53 And it's the old, what do you call it, the old Bencast, haven't had one of these in a while, but sometimes you just gotta do it.
00:01:03 So it's time for me to bloviate and waste both of our time to fill air.
00:01:11 That's not true, I won't do that. I will touch upon some things that happened this week, and then I will go to voicemails and we'll just see how long that takes naturally.
00:01:25 Let's see, what happened? What was the week of April 10th like for me? It was my birthday on Thursday.
00:01:36 It was my birthday and I went to my parents' house and they, we got my eyes tested. I did an optometry appointment.
00:01:43 That was fine. That was great. They blew a little puff of air into my eye, which I don't remember that one.
00:01:52 I don't remember that one happening before. It felt weird. I didn't like it, but oh well.
00:01:59 I have the opportunity to pick some new frames when I get new glasses, but I don't know if I will.
00:02:08 I don't know if I can really improve my classic look, which is just the kind of thick rectangular dark frames. I like them.
00:02:20 I don't think, I don't think it gets much better than that for me.
00:02:27 My prescription, I hadn't been to the optometrist in like 10 years, thereabouts, but apparently my prescription has not changed hardly at all.
00:02:38 She said just a minor tweak, so that's pretty good. Glad I'm not deteriorating, at least not in that department.
00:02:50 One place that I am deteriorating, in a sense. I've been, I've lost a bunch of weight again.
00:03:00 This is, I guess this is now a pattern for me, is that I gain like 50 pounds and then I lose like 50 pounds.
00:03:10 I'm down to, I weighed myself either than I was down to 170. I was almost, no I think I was briefly above 200, maybe around Christmas or so.
00:03:24 Now it's April, or like three months into the year and I've lost like 30 pounds about, so I don't know, I guess I should just stop doing that.
00:03:36 I should just, I should just stop doing that. I don't see any need for it.
00:03:40 I've not been really exercising that much, I've just been dieting, but I guess that's sufficient.
00:03:47 It would probably, it would be better if I was lifting. I still haven't started lifting again.
00:03:52 I know I've been saying I was going due since the start of the year and it's been three months.
00:03:55 I think I've now been not lifting for probably about as long as I was lifting before New Year's and then I stopped because I got sick.
00:04:04 Everybody got sick with COVID.
00:04:08 Then you put it off and you put it off and you put it off and this is what happens.
00:04:13 Another week down the toilet and another and another and another.
00:04:17 Ah well. What else, what else?
00:04:21 Oh, I got, I got a funny video of my mom playing Phantom's Revenge.
00:04:30 It was very funny. She, I might, I'll probably post it or I'll probably, I'd like to post it somewhere.
00:04:36 Like maybe I'll cut it down to like some funny bits when she like talks about dabbing and stuff.
00:04:43 That was pretty funny. She thought she was not going to be able to play it and I said, and I said, no, it's just menus.
00:04:50 Like you don't have to be like a gamer. It's just like a puzzle to solve.
00:04:53 My mom likes puzzles. So maybe that convinced her.
00:04:57 But she, I mean, she, we didn't spend too long on it. I think she was, she was playing it for maybe like half an hour.
00:05:04 And, you know, she, she kept, she kept forgetting which button was like, oh, what's this?
00:05:11 Hello.
00:05:12 Oh my God.
00:05:14 Hello, Ben.
00:05:15 Hello, Giv. You sound like you've been punched in the throat.
00:05:21 Yes. It's just a bit of a throat. Don't worry about it.
00:05:27 Okay.
00:05:28 I was streaming. I was streaming Elden Ring. I forgot. I didn't notice.
00:05:32 You were streaming Elden Ring?
00:05:34 I sure was.
00:05:36 That can't be legal.
00:05:38 Well, you've been living under a rock, Ben St. There's so many. There's so many streams.
00:05:44 That's committing 60 frames a second of copyright infringement.
00:05:48 I wouldn't say 60 frames.
00:05:50 That's, that's FromSoft's intellectual property.
00:05:54 What are they going to do? Come to my house and congratulate me on being such a cool person?
00:06:00 Here's what they're going to do. They're going to come, they're going to come to your house.
00:06:04 They're going to stand outside the fog door at your front door. They're going to walk through.
00:06:08 They're going to start chucking dung pies and black fire bombs.
00:06:12 They're going to dodge roll through your, through your attack, and then they're going to punish you for heavy damage.
00:06:19 They're going to put their divine weapon from the back.
00:06:22 They're going to chop your tail off and receive the mighty, the mighty spear that, you know, obviously would result from such a thing.
00:06:31 And then they're going to apply a pine resin, gold pine resin to their weapon and electrocute you.
00:06:38 And then won't you feel stupid?
00:06:41 But I have a phase two, though.
00:06:43 Oh, shit.
00:06:44 And that's where I, that's where I jump up onto the ceiling and I delete the floor and the floor is gone and they fall to their death.
00:06:51 How'd you get a phase two? I want a phase two.
00:06:55 Mom, wait, how does, how does that thing go? Like, how G-Wiz?
00:07:01 G-Wiz, how come, G-Wiz, Bill, how come your mom lets you have two phases?
00:07:05 Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
00:07:11 I was just, I was just complaining about my week.
00:07:14 The Hulk based.
00:07:16 It was based. I know, right? Tell me about it.
00:07:21 What did I say? I was saying, I got my mom to play Phantom's Revenge and it was pretty funny.
00:07:26 Oh, what did she think?
00:07:28 I recorded some of it.
00:07:30 She thought, I think, well, I think she was, I think she thought it was pretty cool.
00:07:35 I think she thought it was like, wow, how does a person even make a video game?
00:07:40 Which is fair.
00:07:42 And she, I was saying, she felt, she was like, oh, I'm not a gamer. There's no way I can play it.
00:07:49 And I said, no, it's just a puzzle. It's just menus.
00:07:53 And she, and indeed, she died twice.
00:07:57 But like her second death, she made it, she made it further the second time.
00:08:02 She, she knew what she had to do. She just messed it.
00:08:05 Like she knew she had to take out the Soniches with the guns.
00:08:08 She just messed up and didn't select the right one.
00:08:11 So she accidentally killed one without a gun.
00:08:13 And so Virginia got shot and she was like, ah, darn, I lost it. I wasn't supposed to do that.
00:08:18 That was as far as I saw her get.
00:08:21 But she could have beat it with perseverance.
00:08:23 It's the easiest game ever made.
00:08:26 Even my mom can play it.
00:08:28 The easiest game.
00:08:30 Well, I suppose it doesn't have reflex requirements. You just need to click on the right things.
00:08:36 Exactly. There's no iframes.
00:08:39 God, Elden Ring. All right. I don't want to talk too much about Elden Ring.
00:08:43 But I will say, very nice.
00:08:45 Okay.
00:08:46 Very nice.
00:08:47 I am, I might, I might get Elden Ring at some point.
00:08:49 I think my computer could probably handle it.
00:08:52 What was the last big game with lots of detail that you played?
00:08:58 I don't know that I have ever played such a game on my computer.
00:09:04 Not even any other Dark Souls or on your current computer?
00:09:08 No, I have not played any Souls on my computer.
00:09:12 Wow. So cool.
00:09:15 I played Bloodborne on a PS4.
00:09:18 That's not your computer though.
00:09:20 It's not, it's not.
00:09:24 I don't, Hades is like the most, the most graphics game.
00:09:30 Well, you've played Noita, isn't that like intensive just because of the amount of pixels doing things?
00:09:36 It can be, yeah. It can be a bit intense on the old hard drive.
00:09:42 And I mean, it runs fine. Sometimes it crashes, but everybody's like, I don't know.
00:09:46 I feel like it's probably fine.
00:09:50 I mean, you could turn the settings down in Elden Ring and it'll be fine probably.
00:09:55 I was thinking of going on sale, but I asked on Twitter and people said it would probably be a while until it went on sale.
00:10:02 So maybe I should just buy it.
00:10:04 I mean, I was wondering that as well.
00:10:06 I expected it to go on like, oh, Steam Summer Sale, special Elden Ring as soon as I had already bought it.
00:10:13 But like, it's the Steam Summer Sale is currently happening. It's not there.
00:10:18 So like, yeah, probably, probably it'll be a Christmas thing if that.
00:10:23 Hmm. Yeah.
00:10:26 I would be willing to wait like two months for like $30 off or something.
00:10:31 But do I want to wait like eight months?
00:10:36 I just said fuck it because I wanted to have a fun time.
00:10:41 It's a good reason to do anything.
00:10:45 I went, I've been like, I made punk and she's going to be a dagger assassin with a bow.
00:10:58 She's going to stab people in Elden Ring. Yeah.
00:11:01 She's going to stab people. I've been stabbing people in the back. I've been sneaking past things.
00:11:05 The stealth, right? Dark Souls, it's linear.
00:11:09 You go through it and you're expected to at least encounter all the enemies.
00:11:14 But with the stealth mechanic in this game, you can like just get past a lot of dangerous looking things.
00:11:24 It's quite fun figuring out how I can like not trip the aggro range and like sneak past a whole group of enemies and climb a ladder.
00:11:32 You know, I haven't really seen anyone play in stealth.
00:11:36 I've seen like spellcasters and I've seen like I've heard people talk about like strength faith builds.
00:11:41 Yeah. I mean, big swords are cool.
00:11:45 But I've increasingly found that I prefer in any Souls game the ability to do an attack that takes the fewest animation frames possible before I'm allowed to roll.
00:11:57 So that's why I'm choosing a dagger. So it does like you can do like one attack in like a very short time and then have plenty of time to dodge out of the way of the incoming.
00:12:05 Slice.
00:12:07 Interesting.
00:12:08 You could go in and stab them a little bit, jump back, stab them a little bit.
00:12:12 And that makes it easier for me. It takes longer, I think, unless the dagger's really good.
00:12:18 But there's bleed damage build up and occasionally they just explode in blood. That's great.
00:12:23 Mmm. I like the sound of that exploding with blood.
00:12:29 Mmm. Getting hungry. Just thinking about it.
00:12:34 Yeah. I haven't played a Souls since. I played some Bloodborne but not that much.
00:12:40 And I played Dark Souls 1 and like half of Dark Souls 2. So it's been a while.
00:12:46 But I like the idea of just exploring.
00:12:53 Oh yeah.
00:12:54 I think I would just like exploring the world and I might get a little mad at some bosses but I can deal with it.
00:13:00 That's basically what I've been doing.
00:13:02 You get your Horus at some point. I think I sequence broke and just walked the wrong way and missed a lot of the tutorial at the beginning.
00:13:09 But I found my Horus and it came to me.
00:13:13 And then it was really just fun to look at the rolling hills and cliffs and be like,
00:13:21 oh, there's a cool looking church at the top of that thing. How do I get there and scanning the horizon?
00:13:27 Okay, maybe if I go at the bottom of that ravine, it looks like I can go up.
00:13:31 So you find your way down the ravine, up the ravine and it's just like traversing the environment.
00:13:37 And occasionally there's a bunch of scary little gremlins who go ran and you can jump over them or you can attack them.
00:13:44 And I've been exploring a lot of the game past the point where I should have really stopped to fight some bosses.
00:13:55 I was skipping a lot of dangerous encounters and bosses and castles.
00:13:59 I skipped the first main castle, which apparently you're supposed to go there.
00:14:04 You're told to go there and there's a big boss with many hands and he's got a big old thing.
00:14:12 But I just found a way around the castle and then I explored the second area of the game under levels and under equipped.
00:14:19 But it was fun because you can still run away from lots of stuff.
00:14:22 So I explored tons of the map and it was just fun.
00:14:25 It was just fun being scared and running away from everything.
00:14:29 That sounds cool.
00:14:33 You're doing that on the Pump character?
00:14:35 Yeah.
00:14:36 That sounds fun. Sounds cool.
00:14:38 I'm hoping to find a fire spell so I can be Pump on character.
00:14:43 I was joking that it was like this new patch for Pumpkin Alley.
00:14:48 I made this and this is the new game.
00:14:52 When people talked about Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, I always got the feeling that what they were mostly talking about was boss fights.
00:15:05 That's fine and all, but I like that it seems like exploration is more important in Elden Ring.
00:15:16 I think that appeals to me more.
00:15:19 It feels more like you're role playing in a big open world.
00:15:23 I mean, I guess it is. That's the idea. It's an open world game.
00:15:27 The whole Dark Souls boss sort of bragging rights, I guess.
00:15:35 Oh, first try. I killed them and it's cool.
00:15:42 It's like a high skill bar to reach some bosses and it feels great when you get through a lot of them.
00:15:52 But at the core of the experience, I prefer not that I don't like bosses, but I feel more comfortable sneaking around in castles and dungeons and taking out enemies and figuring out whether I can make it through with the amount of healing items I have
00:16:15 and whether I should distract this guy and run past him or defeat all of them so that they don't come and run after me.
00:16:23 Decisions like that. When you're one-on-one with a boss, it's a different sort of game, which I still like.
00:16:30 But I love the exploration. It's really good.
00:16:34 Yeah, I should probably give it a little word.
00:16:39 Give it a shot. Take it for a little test drive for one of these dang days.
00:16:45 Although I haven't quite 100% of the Hades and I kind of want to do that. I'm getting pretty close.
00:16:52 So maybe as soon as I'm done with all that bullshit, I have a little in-game anecdote, a little joke that I laughed really hard at in Hades.
00:17:06 I haven't mentioned it, but it killed me.
00:17:10 In Hades, you get keepsakes from NPCs. When you give them gifts, sometimes they give you things you can equip that give you a special buff or whatever.
00:17:22 And in the endgame, you can get one from Hades. He'll give you a pin or whatever. It makes you invisible.
00:17:30 And when Zagreus uses keepsake, he calls out the name of the person that gave it to him.
00:17:38 And so when he uses the Hades keepsake, he yells out, Father!
00:17:43 Well, the final boss of the game is Hades. And so I learned that when you use Hades keepsake against Hades, Zagreus yells out, Father!
00:17:55 And Hades just says, What? I'm right here. Yes, I can hear you fine. It's so fucking good.
00:18:06 Father!
00:18:08 Father! What? What is it? Yes. I couldn't believe it.
00:18:16 There's so much fucking dialogue, and I've played that game for like 85 hours, and I still have new dialogue every time I restart.
00:18:26 Every time I go back to the house, every character's got a new thing to say. I have not exhausted any of it. It's insane.
00:18:35 It's wild.
00:18:38 Yeah.
00:18:40 Gaiman.
00:18:41 Gaiman.
00:18:42 Gaiman!
00:18:44 First we made games, then we played them.
00:18:47 That's... That's how you do it.
00:18:55 Did you want to talk about Nika?
00:18:59 Oh, yes, yes. Okay, so you caught up with one...
00:19:02 I was kind of... I didn't read this week's chapter.
00:19:06 Oh, well, neither did I. I didn't know it was out.
00:19:09 I'm not sure. I'm up to 10.45.
00:19:12 Did you actually come out on a Wednesday?
00:19:15 Hold on.
00:19:18 Let's see, is 10.46 out yet?
00:19:21 I don't even remember which website I read it on.
00:19:24 There's a few. 10.46.
00:19:28 Okay, oh, 10.47 is out now. Well, I haven't read the last two then.
00:19:32 Oh shit, there is... Okay, yeah. Well, whatever.
00:19:38 Probably the things we were about to talk about could be explained in those chapters.
00:19:44 But yeah, with regards to Nika, the Gear 5,
00:19:49 spoilers for One Piece, if you didn't hear about it before.
00:19:53 Big spoilers for One Piece.
00:19:56 So I listened to the last episode. You and Sims, you talked about it.
00:20:00 And I forget... I wanted to insert myself into the conversation,
00:20:05 say, no, no, no, you see, you see, blah, blah, blah, One Piece, blah, blah, blah.
00:20:10 But now I can't remember what I would have said in response to you.
00:20:14 So I'll just say what I think.
00:20:17 Okay, 10.47 is coming soon.
00:20:21 Okay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
00:20:25 I like the thing you were saying with the themes.
00:20:30 Like it's thematically similar to what Luffy's power has always been thematically about.
00:20:38 The freedom, sort of.
00:20:41 Being like a rubbery, squash and stretch cartoon guy.
00:20:44 Yeah, it's like funny, and Oda likes comedy and silly things.
00:20:50 And it's sort of like, of course, he would make it as silly as possible.
00:20:57 I always liked when Gear 3rd was like ridiculous looking.
00:21:03 And then Gear 4th was like, oh my God, it's Gear 4th.
00:21:06 He's going to be so powerful. And he's like, is a gorilla?
00:21:09 He's like a weird, funny gorilla with tattoos.
00:21:11 And it's like, it's inherently silly looking.
00:21:14 But it's so cool because he's so strong.
00:21:16 4 is where it's like...
00:21:21 I don't even know why he looks like this.
00:21:24 But I guess when he looks like that, he's really strong or whatever.
00:21:29 So, okay.
00:21:30 Yeah, I can't remember.
00:21:33 Yeah, it's just sort of like...
00:21:35 It's kind of like whatever.
00:21:39 Gear 4 is a little bit like, oh, he went super, super, super Saiyan God mode
00:21:45 so his hair is blue now and that means he's stronger.
00:21:47 Is his hair blue?
00:21:49 I've never seen him in color.
00:21:51 No, I'm talking about in Dragon Ball.
00:21:53 In Dragon Ball Super, their hair turns blue for some reason.
00:21:57 The next one that has going to turn green.
00:22:00 It turns blue, but if he's...
00:22:04 Simsie was explaining, but if it's an alternate reality, like evil,
00:22:09 possessed version, if his hair would turn blue, it turns pink instead.
00:22:14 And that's different, but it's the same.
00:22:18 That's kind of how I feel about 4.
00:22:21 4, yeah.
00:22:22 I mean, I don't get the meaning of the tattoos and the...
00:22:26 I see that it's inspired by Japanese-type design things with the tattoos
00:22:32 and the cloud around him.
00:22:34 He's like some sort of a Buddhist thing, maybe.
00:22:36 Yeah.
00:22:37 But I don't know why exactly that is what he looks like from his perspective.
00:22:45 Absolutely no idea.
00:22:47 He's got the black armament hacky going all over him.
00:22:53 And he's fast, like Gear 2nd, but he's not giant like Gear 3rd.
00:22:59 So it's just sort of like Gear 2nd 2, I guess.
00:23:03 But I don't really mind it too much.
00:23:05 It's just whatever.
00:23:06 But Gear 5, this new one, they've been talking about Devil Fruit Awakening.
00:23:12 And the idea that you use your fruit in a way that goes beyond your own body, I guess, is usually...
00:23:23 Have we seen other awakened paramecias before?
00:23:28 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:23:30 I mean, in this whole fight, there's been a kid has used his magnetic one to turn Big Mom magnetic
00:23:39 so that he could stick all that metal to her because that's his thing.
00:23:44 He controls magnetic fields and then he can make someone else magnetic with his Awakening.
00:23:51 Law also has awakened his Devil Fruit, but I don't really understand the metrics, like what the fruit is normally
00:23:59 and then how the Awakening is different.
00:24:04 You could just do a bunch of stuff.
00:24:08 Is his Awakened ability not the thing where he can make someone immortal one time if he dies?
00:24:16 I don't know if that's the Awakening or just like an ability he could use.
00:24:21 Yeah.
00:24:22 How would you know?
00:24:23 How does he know that he has that ability?
00:24:25 I think it was something in his like backstory.
00:24:28 I mean, Law is like a bit of a too cool for school character.
00:24:34 He truly is.
00:24:36 His inclusion has always been a little bit baffling.
00:24:39 I like him, but like it is like the sort of like he's a teen favorite.
00:24:46 All the kids are like, oh, they love Law.
00:24:49 I see myself in him because he's always frowning.
00:24:53 Yeah.
00:24:54 Shadow the Hedgehog.
00:24:55 It's like whatever.
00:24:56 It's fine, but it's like whatever.
00:24:58 He's not like the coolest guy ever and his powers are a bit confusing.
00:25:04 Okay, so do you want?
00:25:06 Also, who else?
00:25:08 What's his name?
00:25:09 The guy in Wano, not Wano, the whole cake who fought Luffy.
00:25:14 Katakuri?
00:25:15 Katakuri.
00:25:16 His Awakening was to turn the environment around him into mochi.
00:25:20 Oh, he was a Logia, right?
00:25:24 No, he was a Parameshia, I think.
00:25:28 Oh, okay.
00:25:29 I think there was like a brief comment about it being a special Parameshia,
00:25:34 which is like who knows what that means?
00:25:38 I'd like to know where people get all this information about the devil fruits.
00:25:43 Is there like devil fruit scholars who have written down these things?
00:25:46 Honestly, yeah, me too.
00:25:49 That's like, that's one of the most intriguing parts of the world of One Piece for me.
00:25:55 And sometimes I get the distressing feeling that it's all just being completely made up
00:26:01 as it goes along and there's very little like thought put into it.
00:26:06 Yeah.
00:26:07 Sometimes it's so weird and obscure that it feels like,
00:26:10 okay, there's like something going on here that I'm not privy to,
00:26:13 but there's more to it than meets the eye.
00:26:15 And other times it's like, no, it's just too fucking weird and stupid.
00:26:19 I mean, I can imagine Oda was like, okay, I'm going to have a bunch of different funny powers.
00:26:26 Sometimes you can turn into an animal, sometimes you can turn into like an intangible
00:26:34 or like a usually non-solid object, like light or water.
00:26:38 I don't know if there's a water log here, but like smoke and fire and all that.
00:26:44 Yeah.
00:26:46 And then a catch-all for every other type of thing where you're not,
00:26:52 you're neither a beast nor a smoke.
00:26:54 Right.
00:26:55 And he's just like, yeah, that'll do.
00:26:57 That won't need clarification or like anything.
00:27:00 Nope.
00:27:01 Nothing confusing about that.
00:27:03 And then he just makes a bunch of like cool powers and he's like,
00:27:06 well, which ones do these fit into?
00:27:08 Some of these are potentially could like cross over halfway.
00:27:13 And he's like, ah, yeah.
00:27:16 Because he's already set the rules in place.
00:27:18 There's three types.
00:27:19 And he's like, well, this one's a special one of those that makes it different.
00:27:24 I don't care.
00:27:25 I just wanted to cool power.
00:27:27 And it's like, I can see his priority is just making the powers funny and cool.
00:27:32 Do you want a minor spoiler for chapter 1046?
00:27:37 I mean, I could look at it right now.
00:27:40 Yeah.
00:27:41 Shall we read it?
00:27:42 I'm just, I just skim through it and I just see the part at the end where he's like
00:27:48 grabbing lightning bolts out of the sky.
00:27:51 Like he's going to throw them like Zeus.
00:27:54 That's weird.
00:27:55 You're talking about.
00:27:56 Is that Luffy?
00:27:57 Yeah.
00:27:58 Luffy.
00:27:59 Nika Luffy is just like throwing lightning bolts like Zeus.
00:28:03 Okay.
00:28:04 Why not?
00:28:07 Uh, sure.
00:28:09 I don't really want to like sit here for like a bit and digest this chapter before we keep
00:28:15 talking.
00:28:16 But I also don't want to not know what's going on.
00:28:22 That's just me.
00:28:23 I was just, I was just looking, I was just looking through.
00:28:26 Um, but yeah, the Nika, I like the way it looks.
00:28:30 I like the fact that it's Tom and Jerry cartoon, Popeye, like silly, wacky, zany, uh, goofy.
00:28:38 And, uh, it's exactly the sort of thing.
00:28:41 It's the sort of, it's exactly the sort of thing gear five should be and the powers of
00:28:46 the awakening devil for being able to turn things rubber.
00:28:49 So like being able to punch someone like a cartoon, uh, through their chest in a way
00:28:56 that they would kill them if it was real.
00:28:58 But if they're made of rubber and it doesn't matter, um, then it's fine.
00:29:03 So he punches Kido through the head really hard.
00:29:06 Yeah.
00:29:07 Because he turns Kido into rubber.
00:29:08 Stretches.
00:29:09 Yeah.
00:29:10 Yeah.
00:29:11 It's just like, that's, that's exactly the right cool thing that it could be, should be.
00:29:15 Yeah.
00:29:16 Um, that's great.
00:29:18 And, uh, I think that I think you and Simsie also had this problem just that it's like
00:29:25 a little asinine that the fruit is like so special and important.
00:29:33 It could have just been, this is what Luffy's Awakening does.
00:29:37 Yeah.
00:29:39 It could have done, it could have done all the same things and the, and the explanation
00:29:43 could have been, oh, he's awakened his, his devil fruit.
00:29:47 He can turn other things into rubber and I guess it makes his hair turn into steam.
00:29:51 Yeah.
00:29:52 Just because.
00:29:53 I feel like the, the reveal that the other gurus say talking about the fruit being joy
00:30:00 boy related or joy boys fruit or something relating to liberator, the liberator, the
00:30:07 freedom fruit, the special one that is so important to the world government.
00:30:12 It's, it's.
00:30:13 They can't let anybody have it.
00:30:14 And it's like.
00:30:15 Okay.
00:30:16 To the point where they would sacrifice one of their CP zero members to stop Luffy from
00:30:20 winning the fight.
00:30:21 Yeah.
00:30:22 It's like, uh, but weird.
00:30:25 I don't really understand why they didn't do that.
00:30:28 I mean, lots of fruits are like really, really powerful.
00:30:34 Like, sure, I guess, I guess this Nika fruit is pretty good, but like, you know, Kaido's
00:30:40 dragon fruit is also like a really powerful fruit that probably if I was the world government,
00:30:47 I would think it was really important not to let some pirate eat it.
00:30:50 Uh, you know, same for like a hundred other fruits.
00:30:54 Yeah.
00:30:55 Turn you into a fucking like island killer level threat just by having it.
00:31:02 Yeah.
00:31:03 I mean.
00:31:04 It's like, like is Luffy's is the Nika is the is the Nika fruit.
00:31:09 Is it is it much more dangerous than the Gura Gura fruit, which lets you destroy a whole
00:31:14 island just if you want to.
00:31:17 I, I, well, I think the fact that they mentioned liberator and like freedom and joy boy.
00:31:24 When they talk about that fruit is implying that the damage it can do is not physical
00:31:31 necessarily, but it's like, like could upend their society politically.
00:31:38 So, but like, I don't understand how the fruit specifically does that.
00:31:46 I feel like that either implies that the power Luffy has is the power to rouse people to fight
00:31:55 against their oppressors or something, which is like has nothing to do with being silly
00:32:02 and goofy and he's not exhibiting any like power that does that as far as I know.
00:32:08 Like what it literally does is what you would expect an awakened gum gum fruit to do, which
00:32:15 is turn things into wacky rubber.
00:32:18 I guess maybe it could have some secondary effect of freedom, whatever that means.
00:32:27 It's just sort of annoying.
00:32:29 Well, yeah, well, yeah, it is annoying because the idea of like being the king of the pirates is like the
00:32:37 most free you can be and that's and Luffy wants that because he wants freedom and he
00:32:42 hates people being trampled over and not being able to do what they like.
00:32:47 And so he punches guys who stop freedom from happening.
00:32:51 That's right.
00:32:52 You know, he beat the shit out of crocodile, not necessarily because crocodile was starting a war,
00:32:56 but because it made VV upset that she was trapped in this, you know, it's more of a personal thing.
00:33:03 He wasn't trying to be a hero.
00:33:05 He was just trying to be free and that's just what he felt like doing.
00:33:09 And so I from what I like from reading the whole manga, it felt like Luffy has that sort of that attitude
00:33:18 that inspires people to fight for their own freedom as well.
00:33:23 And that's why like at the end of Dressrosa, he's got like an army following him because they are inspired
00:33:30 by him to like fight back against people that otherwise would not get challenged.
00:33:36 And it's like, oh, he's got this army.
00:33:38 He doesn't care about the army.
00:33:39 He doesn't want it, but they're doing it anyway.
00:33:42 And it's sort of like Luffy as a person is inspiring change.
00:33:47 He's changing people's minds.
00:33:49 He's making it so that the world can overthrow the world government and reveal the void century information.
00:33:56 But remember, one piece is not political.
00:34:00 It has no political messages in it at all.
00:34:02 It doesn't mean anything.
00:34:04 Don't get it twisted now.
00:34:06 No.
00:34:07 Okay.
00:34:08 I hear you.
00:34:09 The sort of the sort of thematic obvious direction it's going is like,
00:34:13 king of the pirates equals freedom.
00:34:16 So to become the king of the pirates, you must make the world free kind of.
00:34:21 So the world government will be toppled or at least the dismantled, disbanded, the Marines will not be bad people.
00:34:30 I mean, they're good people in the Marines.
00:34:32 So they'll probably still be there at the end being like, oh, now we're good cops.
00:34:36 That's fine, whatever.
00:34:38 But like the obviously slave enslavement of like people in Marishwa and all of the super higher ups and whatever was happening in the void century that they're trying to cover up is gets revealed and everybody around the world hears that.
00:34:52 And they're like, oh my God, I hate the world government now.
00:34:54 Revolution.
00:34:55 And it's like, but like, you know what?
00:34:57 That's great.
00:34:58 That's great.
00:34:59 I just don't like the implication that that is because Luffy ate a fruit and not because he himself is inherently like he inspires people inspiring through his actual character trait.
00:35:11 Like is the fruit doing anything or is it not?
00:35:15 It's, you know, I feel like that they might never specify.
00:35:23 It might maybe, maybe, maybe, I mean, maybe Joy Boy was this like liberator God because of the fruit or maybe he just was like that.
00:35:37 And he also happened to eat the same fruit.
00:35:39 I mean, it could be like the devil fruits were created with the will of people in them.
00:35:48 And this one was created by Joy Boy and it has Joy Boy's will in it.
00:35:52 But it still, it still feels like that means that Luffy is not himself doing all of the good he's doing.
00:36:00 He's doing it because he has a fruit that he ate.
00:36:02 It could also, if I'm going to be charitable, I think what they're going for, what it is going for is like the fruit chooses the wizard Harry Potter.
00:36:13 The fruit shows Luffy because he was exactly the right person to be the guy who has that fruit power.
00:36:19 That's probably what it is.
00:36:21 Maybe in the same way that maybe the flame fruit chose Sabo or something.
00:36:30 There's some kind of destiny at work that's like Sabo got Ace's fruit.
00:36:34 Yeah, I don't know.
00:36:36 I guess there'll be more to be revealed.
00:36:40 Initially, the reveal was like, oh, that's cool, but why is that extra thing there?
00:36:47 I suppose it could be good.
00:36:49 It could be good.
00:36:50 I am, yeah, it makes me wonder about all that stuff, about the nature of fruits and powers and all that.
00:37:08 Yeah, until we know really what the fruit is doing, I guess I'm not sure what I think.
00:37:20 If it turned out that the Nika fruit just made Luffy into this freedom fighter dude and it was just the fruit acting through him and controlling his destiny, I would be like, ehh.
00:37:41 I feel like there's no chance that that is the intention, but it might be an unintentional implication if they don't make it more obviously something else.
00:37:53 Yeah, I hear it.
00:37:59 I just want to know.
00:38:01 Tell me more about fruits, Oda, please.
00:38:03 Tell me where do they come from?
00:38:05 Who made them?
00:38:06 Why?
00:38:07 How?
00:38:08 What's up?
00:38:09 I would imagine the fruits were invented in the Void Century.
00:38:13 You know who I really wish didn't die was Odin's wife, because she was from the Void Century.
00:38:26 You pick up on that?
00:38:28 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:38:30 She traveled into the future.
00:38:32 She was from 800 years ago and that's when the Void Century was, so like, dang, would have been really good if she just traveled forward in time one more time and didn't get killed.
00:38:44 Okay, I forget if this was ever mentioned in that flashback.
00:38:52 Did she tell Odin what all of that was?
00:38:57 Did she tell him the secret?
00:38:59 All of what?
00:39:00 The Void Century stuff.
00:39:02 I don't think she ever really brought it up.
00:39:05 It's just mentioned that that's how old she is and that just happens to line up with how long ago the Void Century was.
00:39:13 I feel like there's a reason that that was the case.
00:39:18 Yeah, the number is not arbitrary.
00:39:21 So, like, information of the Void Century from her past to Odin could be if it could be past to Momonosuke or Kyori.
00:39:30 Yeah, absolutely.
00:39:32 It seems really important to me that she just happens to be the same age as when the Void Century happened.
00:39:42 That seems like that's there for a reason and there's going to be something with that.
00:39:46 It's the sort of thing that would be like after Wano is finished and people are sitting around being like, wow, what a battle, huh?
00:39:56 That shit was crazy.
00:39:58 Everyone's like, damn, remember when we all collectively hallucinated that Luffy had a weird mythical zoan fruit that turned his hair white?
00:40:06 That was like a crazy trip.
00:40:08 Good thing it was just a dream.
00:40:10 Yeah, and they're having a feast and then whatever.
00:40:12 And then Momonosuke's there and offhandedly just mentioned something about the Void Century and then Niko Robin's eyes wide and she's like, huh?
00:40:22 Well, wait a minute.
00:40:24 I've heard about that in the Ponyglyphs, but I wasn't sure what it meant.
00:40:27 Could you tell me?
00:40:30 And then she talks to him.
00:40:32 She gains more knowledge and that's like that would be a little scene.
00:40:37 I love it when Niko Robin gains knowledge.
00:40:39 She's so fucking smart.
00:40:41 It's so fucking hot when she gets smarter.
00:40:46 You know, I apparently was confused.
00:40:50 I had thought, and I guess I was wrong, but I had thought that Momosuke, is it Momonosuke?
00:40:58 Is that the kid's name?
00:40:59 Momonosuke, yeah.
00:41:00 I thought that Momonosuke had eaten a smile.
00:41:02 I thought his dragon was from a smile, but I guess it's not.
00:41:05 No, no.
00:41:06 It was from a failed recreation made by Vegapunk.
00:41:11 Isn't that the same thing?
00:41:14 Isn't that what a smile is?
00:41:16 I think Vegapunk lied about it being a failure.
00:41:19 Yeah, because it just gave him the exact same fruit as Kaido had.
00:41:26 It's the same dragon.
00:41:27 It's clearly not a failure.
00:41:29 Vegapunk probably would have lied.
00:41:30 I feel like Vegapunk is not a bad person deep down.
00:41:35 He works for the government because he has to.
00:41:38 Hard to say.
00:41:40 When the idea of the world government getting in control of an exact copy of Kaido's dragon fish fruit,
00:41:51 that would be very dangerous, and he doesn't want the world government to actually...
00:41:55 Oh, it was a failure.
00:41:57 I'll throw it away.
00:41:59 Yeah, it just made him a little dragon.
00:42:01 It sucks.
00:42:02 Don't even worry about it.
00:42:03 I mean, Alkiji and Akainu came onto the punk hazard and they started their fight and they had to leave.
00:42:10 Hey, Oblivionfall.
00:42:12 Hello, I'm recording.
00:42:14 Hey, Oblivion.
00:42:16 Should we all sync, by the way?
00:42:18 We didn't sync when you joined.
00:42:20 Yeah, let's sync.
00:42:21 Let's do that right now.
00:42:23 On the count of three, say sync.
00:42:25 One, two, three, sync.
00:42:27 Sync.
00:42:28 One, two, three, sync.
00:42:30 Sync.
00:42:31 Okay.
00:42:32 We're just talking about one piece, Oblivion.
00:42:34 What the fuck?
00:42:35 There's one of those...
00:42:36 Are you up to date?
00:42:37 Well, actually, we're not up to date on the most recent chapter.
00:42:40 I'm one chapter behind.
00:42:42 I know nothing at all, but I also cannot comprehend.
00:42:45 That means we can spoil everything and you can say it by the time you read it.
00:42:48 Exactly.
00:42:49 Well, let me tell you.
00:42:50 I mean, you know that it's about a boy made of rubber, right?
00:42:54 It's about rubber ross, the pirate.
00:42:56 That's what I mean.
00:42:57 That's correct.
00:42:58 Well, the big thing lately is that it was revealed that the gum gum fruit, which turned
00:43:05 him into rubber, was not actually the gum gum fruit.
00:43:08 It's the gum gum fruit.
00:43:10 Oh, sure.
00:43:11 That's true.
00:43:12 It was a mythical fruit that gave him the powers of the liberator, sun god, Nika.
00:43:22 And that's what it is, actually.
00:43:24 The rubber stuff was just kind of a side effect.
00:43:27 Damn.
00:43:28 He's he's this like it's like a god power, basically.
00:43:31 So it's pretty wacky.
00:43:34 He's the wacky inflatable arm man in real life.
00:43:38 He is.
00:43:39 He is all that and more.
00:43:42 I got to say when I like now that I've figured out what he's meant to be like his hair is
00:43:49 white because it's made of steam in the same way that like the gears had like steam coming
00:43:54 out of him.
00:43:55 I think it's cool.
00:43:57 I think about it the cooler.
00:43:58 I think that is like a design wise.
00:44:01 I think that's part of it.
00:44:02 I also think if you might be like he's like aging his body rapidly is the implication
00:44:09 another implication you could take because there's like one power where he's like, oh,
00:44:14 I'm so fucking old because this is taking a toll on my body.
00:44:18 And then he goes, no, I'm going to fight.
00:44:20 I'm going to keep fighting.
00:44:21 But that's when he he like goes on Nika and his hair turns black again.
00:44:25 He's like takes too much energy.
00:44:28 No, you're right.
00:44:29 Never mind.
00:44:30 Yeah, I think it's just more like steam.
00:44:32 This turns into steam.
00:44:33 It's cool.
00:44:34 I like it.
00:44:36 He's so white.
00:44:38 Oh my God.
00:44:39 He's the whitest king there ever was.
00:44:41 He's the white.
00:44:42 He's the whitest kid you know.
00:44:44 True.
00:44:47 If you think about it.
00:44:49 What's up oblivion?
00:44:50 What's going on?
00:44:52 I remembered the topic but I forgot to talk about a few weeks ago when I was on.
00:44:57 That was so mad about because I forgot about it.
00:45:01 That's one reason I'm here.
00:45:03 It feels like feels like a while since I don't even remember it was like two months ago.
00:45:08 Last time was like maybe three weeks ago.
00:45:10 It wasn't that long ago.
00:45:12 No, I swear it was.
00:45:16 No, I'm going to the PCP.
00:45:20 You're a big liar.
00:45:23 You're going to prison.
00:45:25 Let's see.
00:45:26 PC prison.
00:45:27 Let's see.
00:45:28 Three weeks ago, Phantom Revenge is out.
00:45:30 Feet oblivion fall.
00:45:31 Got him.
00:45:32 Oh, I don't remember that.
00:45:35 I think it's when we had the...
00:45:37 Phantom Revenge?
00:45:38 What's that?
00:45:39 What?
00:45:40 What?
00:45:41 It was when we talked about wheels and doors.
00:45:43 Oh, that's right.
00:45:44 If you can believe it.
00:45:45 Oh, sure.
00:45:46 But now the other reason I'm here is that my project's done.
00:45:50 It's not out, but it's done.
00:45:52 The video?
00:45:53 Yeah, all the animation, all the compositing and effects.
00:45:57 I finished them up yesterday.
00:45:58 Oh, the site to site.
00:46:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:46:02 It'll maybe come out later today.
00:46:04 Well, a couple days ago for when people see this, but...
00:46:07 I've been waiting.
00:46:09 I've been...
00:46:10 I haven't been...
00:46:11 I've been edging.
00:46:12 I've been edging.
00:46:13 I haven't seen you around much.
00:46:15 So I've been assuming that you've probably had your nose to the grindstone.
00:46:18 Oh, yeah.
00:46:19 Yeah.
00:46:20 Well, actually, for two weeks, I couldn't work on it because I had to work on a video
00:46:25 for DA Games.
00:46:27 I had to do this big five-minute-long music video in 3D that I made in like two weeks.
00:46:34 Funny, I can make those projects in two weeks, but my own project's taken me months.
00:46:39 I know how it is.
00:46:43 What's it called?
00:46:44 Actually, what's the name of it?
00:46:46 The DA Games one, I can link it.
00:46:48 No, I meant your video.
00:46:51 It's gonna be...
00:46:52 Oh, my video is Ancazonexcomzone.
00:46:55 Okay.
00:46:56 I think that's the title I'm going with.
00:46:58 All right.
00:47:00 You know, that meme from like September, it's been like seven months since that was the
00:47:05 game.
00:47:06 I don't know that meme from September.
00:47:08 Damn.
00:47:09 It was a zone?
00:47:11 Yeah, it was zone and minus A.
00:47:13 Zone animated, Anca.
00:47:15 Oh, Anca from Animal Crossing.
00:47:17 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:47:19 It was like music and then she just had sex on camera and then all of the little kids'
00:47:27 babies on Twitter, they're like, oh, my God, I've never seen sex before.
00:47:31 What the fuck?
00:47:32 Oh, my God, that's literally me.
00:47:34 And they're like, oh, my God, what the fuck?
00:47:37 And that became a meme because people were freaking out over that.
00:47:42 And then they were like, no, she's just dancing.
00:47:45 And then Zone made a dancing video and that's like everyone pretends it's their original.
00:47:52 I see.
00:47:53 Fascinating.
00:47:54 That was kind of funny.
00:47:55 Hmm, okay.
00:47:56 I do remember that Anca animation.
00:47:59 I didn't know there was like a story to go with it.
00:48:03 I didn't know a thing happened.
00:48:05 All the YouTube comments were like, whoa, when you realize she's not dancing.
00:48:09 Wah, she's actually fucking.
00:48:11 Wah, sex cat.
00:48:13 Wah.
00:48:14 Wah.
00:48:15 Wah.
00:48:16 Crazy.
00:48:17 And then they learned their lesson.
00:48:19 They now find the bowling pin having sex with the, no, the bowling ball and sex with the
00:48:25 bowling pin and they can't handle it.
00:48:28 What do they think of next?
00:48:29 It's like, I mean, you say what do we think of next.
00:48:31 Technology sure is amazing.
00:48:33 I mean, it was just another one of those instances where Totally Spies did it first.
00:48:41 Yeah.
00:48:42 Yeah.
00:48:43 I mean, look, wait, general or links.
00:48:46 Where do I put stuff?
00:48:48 Uh, general, I guess.
00:48:49 Yeah, yeah.
00:48:50 Um, yeah, Totally Spies did it.
00:48:53 I looked up the clip.
00:48:54 There's a video for it too.
00:48:56 Yeah, it's exact.
00:48:57 It's actually did it twice.
00:49:00 These pins are hotter.
00:49:01 These pins are hotter than that white one.
00:49:05 You would say that.
00:49:06 That food fight looking pin is gross.
00:49:09 I don't like it.
00:49:11 Yeah, we did it a second time with a different aesthetic.
00:49:14 We just keep doing it.
00:49:16 Yeah, and I've been thinking about like, has anyone like actually made a video going like
00:49:21 if I watch every episode of Totally Spies and like write down every single fetish that it
00:49:25 like started or at least contributed to because I know, but it sounds like the kind of video
00:49:31 that would get clicks.
00:49:32 I clicked on a random video and there was like hyper muscle growth like in there.
00:49:37 There's just an episode on YouTube called like the incredible bulk and I'm like, let
00:49:41 me guess, it's going to be like some hyper muscle shit.
00:49:43 And I clicked on it and there was and then at the end, the one of the girls goes muscular
00:49:47 and she has like, she has like titties and it's like sex and I'm like, damn.
00:49:52 That's crazy.
00:49:53 I can't believe they would do that.
00:49:56 It's weird because I remember Totally Spies.
00:49:59 I only watched like a few episodes, but like, I could tell that it was like sexual because
00:50:05 they were in tight spandex the whole time.
00:50:08 Wasn't that sexual?
00:50:10 No, but I was young.
00:50:11 I was like, I don't know, 13 or 14.
00:50:14 I was like, there's some sort of thing with girls here and I'm thinking something.
00:50:20 But like, I don't remember anything like ridiculously fetishistic going on.
00:50:26 I saw girls in tight jumpsuits and I said, this is too political for me.
00:50:32 I'm out.
00:50:36 I didn't really watch it that much.
00:50:38 I watched like, yeah, I watched a little bit of it.
00:50:43 Don't remember it.
00:50:44 I don't remember it being weird, but maybe in hindsight, I could be like, remember how
00:50:51 every time anyone got tied up in rope in my little pony, people would be like, oh my
00:50:55 God, it's bondage fetish.
00:50:57 I mean, there is plenty of that in Totally Spies too.
00:51:00 Of course.
00:51:01 Of course there is.
00:51:02 Yeah.
00:51:03 They're spies.
00:51:04 They're going to get like strapped to a table with like a laser that's going to cut them
00:51:07 in half.
00:51:08 That's just what spies do.
00:51:10 Totally.
00:51:11 Which is hot.
00:51:12 Totally.
00:51:13 Yeah, I agree.
00:51:17 One fetish that I like, I just saw one artist like drawing it and it was like, and they
00:51:23 draw it a lot.
00:51:24 So it's clear they're fetish.
00:51:25 I found an image that's not too sexual to show off what I'm talking about.
00:51:29 I think the artist is Frank Tonius.
00:51:31 It's not a fetish I get, but it's like, we're like, you've swapped body parts with different
00:51:37 people who have like different shades of skin.
00:51:41 Like the arm might be like slightly brown.
00:51:44 Like your leg is black or something.
00:51:48 And that, I saw this artist, I followed them for big titties and I saw them drawing this
00:51:52 stuff on the side and I'm like, wait, Totally Spies has an episode where I did that.
00:51:56 There was like a woman who like every body part was like a slightly like different shade
00:52:00 of skin color.
00:52:01 Boy, that's really weird.
00:52:03 She had like stolen body parts from so many people and I'm like, damn, Totally Spies did
00:52:08 this too.
00:52:10 I'm sure there's more.
00:52:11 I'm sure if I watched the show, I'd find like hundreds.
00:52:14 I gotta be honest.
00:52:15 I've never heard of this particular fetish before, which is surprising.
00:52:19 I feel like I've heard it all.
00:52:22 I mean, I think I've only really seen this artist do it.
00:52:26 It's not like a super popular one, but it's one.
00:52:31 It sure is.
00:52:33 Oh, wait.
00:52:35 Hang on.
00:52:36 Oblivion.
00:52:37 You haven't done the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter backer reward survey.
00:52:41 There's a survey.
00:52:43 There's a survey.
00:52:45 I need it so that you, I know your address.
00:52:48 I can send you the thing.
00:52:50 Oh, right.
00:52:51 It should be in your email somewhere.
00:52:53 I see the issue.
00:52:55 I think I'm looking at our DMs.
00:52:57 I think I may have been like just waking up in bed looking on my phone when I saw that
00:53:04 and then when I got to my computer, the notification was gone.
00:53:08 That makes sense.
00:53:10 I need to remember what fucking email I used so I can find it.
00:53:15 Yeah.
00:53:16 I'm worried that like a number of people don't remember their login details and as such have no way.
00:53:23 There probably will be.
00:53:25 Probably at least a handful of people will simply never respond to the query.
00:53:31 It's just the way it goes.
00:53:33 You just got to make your own best faith attempt to reach them.
00:53:38 And if they don't, then you know, you just got to let them go.
00:53:42 You just got to give up and let them fall into the abyss where they belong.
00:53:47 Yeah.
00:53:48 But yeah, oblivion for you are one of the people who I could contact otherwise.
00:53:52 The rest of them, I don't know what their names are on Discord or Twitter.
00:53:56 So if they don't respond to the email, that's the end and I can't get them their thing.
00:54:02 Yeah.
00:54:03 I, oh my God, I have so many fucking emails.
00:54:07 You know what would be in the like the subject line so I can search for it.
00:54:12 Well, it would be from Kickstarter.
00:54:15 Oh, true.
00:54:17 I'll narrow it down.
00:54:19 It doesn't seem to be associated with that email address.
00:54:22 Let's try this one.
00:54:24 Oh, yes, here it is.
00:54:26 Blah, blah, blah.
00:54:28 Well, you should be able to log into your Kickstarter account and you should see an
00:54:32 activity you should have gotten like a notice that's like a request for a survey response.
00:54:40 I mean, I'm logged in.
00:54:44 Messages.
00:54:46 Verify password.
00:54:47 Okay.
00:54:48 I mean, I'll try and forgive us all.
00:54:50 Blah.
00:54:52 Anybody listening who is also a backer.
00:54:57 Please check your email because there's like like 17 people left.
00:55:02 Hey, aren't you coming to the US and like, I think we were talking about it yesterday.
00:55:09 Aren't you coming in like six weeks or something like not that long?
00:55:13 I'm coming in May.
00:55:15 So yeah, I guess so.
00:55:17 Yeah, that's pretty close.
00:55:18 That's next month.
00:55:20 Oh boy.
00:55:21 That's fucked.
00:55:23 I'm going to see people.
00:55:24 I'm going to be in person.
00:55:26 I'm going to be terrifying.
00:55:28 And then I will have the, and then I will, I will get, I will, I will be that the Pluture
00:55:35 who has the zine, has the plush, has the comic.
00:55:41 Yes.
00:55:42 Yeah, finally.
00:55:44 I'll be that guy rubbing my hands together.
00:55:48 It was so satisfying.
00:55:49 The last few big sets of sending out the Lord of Ghost comic and the plush.
00:55:58 Getting all those boxes and envelopes sealed and writing on the serial numbers and the
00:56:04 printing out the labels and sticking them on the customs things.
00:56:08 It's like, ah, I was a machine.
00:56:10 I was doing everything.
00:56:12 Got so many done per day.
00:56:14 And there's like, let me check.
00:56:18 There's like four or five like completely empty boxes that had comics in them.
00:56:24 And it's a few more left.
00:56:26 You did it.
00:56:27 Almost.
00:56:28 I did it.
00:56:29 I almost, I basically did it.
00:56:32 There's a few people in Australia, a few people in America.
00:56:35 I want to do the American and Australian together in one big like collection because it's better
00:56:40 that way.
00:56:41 I still have some packages from like a year ago that I was supposed to go to Australia
00:56:47 and I still haven't sent them because they have, as far as I'm aware, they have not
00:56:50 resumed first class mail to Australia from the US yet.
00:56:55 So I just can't, yeah.
00:56:58 I got, I got like a Blu-ray and like maybe a Vapors copy and like, oh no, it was a road
00:57:03 to Radcon.
00:57:04 There's just like two envelopes sitting here, just waiting for them to be like, okay, we'll
00:57:09 mail to Australia again.
00:57:11 Thanks.
00:57:12 Okay.
00:57:13 So the last email I got like sending me a link to the survey was on January 23rd.
00:57:20 So anyone listening, if he wants to do a survey, look for emails around that date, I guess.
00:57:27 I found it.
00:57:28 I just had to scroll a lot.
00:57:30 All right.
00:57:31 You know what?
00:57:32 I'm, my project for this week, I have a, I mentioned it last episode, but I'm, I'm drawing
00:57:38 a Tales Get Strolled page.
00:57:40 Oh yeah.
00:57:41 Yeah.
00:57:42 I just, I just started it yesterday.
00:57:44 I put it off for a few days.
00:57:46 I have until, I think I have to, I have to draw it in the next four days, which should be
00:57:53 doable.
00:57:54 I think there's like 18 panels.
00:57:56 This is not that bad.
00:58:01 These are set in, in the, they're in the world.
00:58:07 Well, some of them are in the world inside of Coyote's book, which I had forgotten what,
00:58:13 what it looks like, but it's like a purple like nighttime land with like gravestones
00:58:19 everywhere.
00:58:20 I must confess, I have not finished, not got caught up with Tales Get Strolled.
00:58:28 I also had to like reread the like the latest chapters because I was not caught up either.
00:58:34 I genuinely can't remember where I stopped.
00:58:38 I remember Pac-Man.
00:58:40 Yeah.
00:58:42 And I think Tales has just finished their, their training.
00:58:47 Did you get to the part with Cheeto Man and the big like mass grave?
00:58:52 I forget.
00:58:54 I know Cheeto Man was there.
00:58:57 You meet Cheeto Man earlier, but then he becomes like a big.
00:59:01 Yeah.
00:59:02 The mass grave.
00:59:03 That sounds very fun.
00:59:06 That's a highlight for sure.
00:59:10 Yeah.
00:59:11 Fucking Tales Get Strolled.
00:59:13 Fucking Tales Get Strolled.
00:59:15 The, the, yeah, there's a, there's Satan.
00:59:20 Like half of my pages are like Coyote and Demaro and Gary's soul in Coyote's book realm.
00:59:31 And then the other half of them are Satan, sort of like monologuing in hell.
00:59:37 So that's pretty exciting.
00:59:41 Gary is a, it's funny, like there's, I have like some disagreements.
00:59:49 I have some slight disagreements with the way that some of the other guest artists have drawn Gary.
00:59:55 The last, the person who's drawn the most, Gary, sort of gave him like link hair.
01:00:01 He sort of has like a frilly sort of like link cut and I don't agree with that.
01:00:06 I don't think that's what his original art was meant to look like.
01:00:10 So I'm sort of giving it my own interpretation.
01:00:15 Gary, Gary is the guy who, he sort of has like an Android face for a lot of the comic.
01:00:23 And then he gets even more of his face destroyed and replaced with Android parts.
01:00:27 And then there's the part where he fights Demaro and he like covers himself in like magma armor because he's an earth bender.
01:00:34 And he almost beats Demaro, but then he dies.
01:00:39 And then his soul gets eaten by the eye monster in Demaro's forehead.
01:00:45 And then Coyote manages to free his soul.
01:00:48 And now his soul is just kind of hanging out and being a dick and like insulting Demaro because he's mad that he died.
01:00:55 Hmm. Yeah, sounds reasonable.
01:00:57 You know. And then Coyote, so actually Coyote has Gary's body.
01:01:02 And so Coyote is controlling Gary's body and Gary's soul is just kind of hanging out and like watching him do that.
01:01:10 Coyote is like, hey man, could you explain to me like how your powers work so I can use them?
01:01:15 And he's like, fuck you, man. You're a bitch.
01:01:21 It's pretty, it's pretty weird. It's pretty funny.
01:01:26 Coyote is like, I don't know.
01:01:30 I think this is after the part that I got to in my lecture.
01:01:34 Like I think this all happens after, but Coyote is like, he's like covered in wounds now.
01:01:41 Like he's got his ears got chopped off and like his neck got cut open and like his back, his spine got sliced open.
01:01:48 And so he had to like put his, his like weird like neutral soul strings and he had to use them to like stitch his body back together.
01:01:58 So now he's got all these like scars all over him that are like he's got these glowing yellow strings holding him together.
01:02:03 It's awesome. They're rules.
01:02:07 Great, great, great, great comic.
01:02:11 Happy, happy to be doing a page for it.
01:02:14 I do have the physical comic, but it's falling wild.
01:02:19 Really? I didn't, oh, I didn't get it. I wanted it, but I forgot to buy it.
01:02:24 Yeah, it's on the shelf. I mean.
01:02:26 Sorry, isn't it?
01:02:27 It's on a different shelf.
01:02:29 Okay.
01:02:30 Okay, I don't know if these pages correspond to the actual panel or pages of the comic, but I'm on 135.
01:02:37 What chapter is it? Because it's divided into chapters that are like 20 pages each.
01:02:42 Let's see.
01:02:44 The silver hedgehog.
01:02:47 Everybody's favorite.
01:02:51 Oh, chapter six.
01:02:53 Yeah, there's like, there's like 25 chapters now.
01:02:55 Lol. Okay. Yeah, this is volume one. So it's not the whole thing.
01:02:59 Yeah.
01:03:03 I mean, some of the, some of the guest art in like chapter, chapter four is like really good.
01:03:10 They got some, they got some dudes. Hold on, let me, let me find it. Let me find a really good one.
01:03:17 I was, I was, I was, I was refreshing my memory of the story and I was going through, I think it was in chapter 24.
01:03:23 I was like, yow. Yowza.
01:03:27 When a young man is suddenly trolled by two individuals from a nation of real life internet trolls.
01:03:33 It initiates a chain of events leading to an all out war between several opposing factions, influencing the lives of hundreds of characters.
01:03:42 True that.
01:03:44 The TGT saga chronicles the profound human drama resulting from these events, while at the same time providing an in depth examination of the themes contained therein,
01:03:54 including morality, vengeance, camaraderie, betrayal, romance, dark magic, drug use, and more.
01:04:01 Drugs.
01:04:04 It's, it's, it's, it's got, it's got all that and more. Okay. It's not letting me copy paste because the image is too big here.
01:04:12 Image is too fucking powerful.
01:04:16 What if volume two is out? I don't know if, if a CC is working on that.
01:04:24 I'm sure he's working on it to some extent. I don't know. I'm sure I would have heard about it if it were out though.
01:04:33 Okay, I got to just shrink this image a little bit so I can change image resolution.
01:04:40 I forgot Batman was part of the secret society.
01:04:45 There's, there's Batman, there's Cheeto Man, there's Dexter, Hello Kitty, Kermit the Frog, Ronald McDonald, Spyro, Vivian, and Woodstock.
01:04:54 Vivian from Paper Mario and Woodstock from Peanuts.
01:04:58 Yeah, I remember, I remember most of those. I kind of forgot about Batman. He's not that important.
01:05:04 Ronald McDonald, obviously, the unhinged psychopath.
01:05:10 Frogger and leapfrog.
01:05:12 How, how is it that I take a JPEG, shrink it, and then save it as, save the shrunken image as a JPEG and it ends up with a bigger file size than the original?
01:05:24 How does that work?
01:05:28 Bad.
01:05:30 Bad file.
01:05:32 How can this be? This isn't, this is not logical.
01:05:37 Alright.
01:05:38 Encoding us the word.
01:05:42 I just, I just want to show some of this cool, uh, here, I'll just, I'll just screen grab it.
01:05:51 There we go. Look, look at this shit. There's, there's like, there's like a lot like this. There's a big section at the end of Chapter 24.
01:05:59 Oh no, Road Runner.
01:06:02 Oh yeah. Oh yeah, they got Road Runner.
01:06:05 Is that the canonical end of, of, you know, the Road Runner cartoons? Is this?
01:06:12 No, I think he's, I think he's back. You know, all, all Coyote has to do is like, stitch his frickin' body back together and he's just fine.
01:06:20 Cause he's just, he's just a corpse being puppeted.
01:06:25 Here we go.
01:06:26 Meep, meep.
01:06:27 This one's a pretty, I guess he's killing Sonichu here. I forget why he's doing that.
01:06:34 Phantom, Phantom, Phantom Horn and Coyote. The two things they've got in common is the Kill Sonichus.
01:06:41 It's a new, a new show, Phantom Horn and Coyote.
01:06:45 Yeah. Best, best friends.
01:06:49 Uh, uh, uh.
01:06:51 What if Phantom Horn was in Tales Get Strolled?
01:06:55 We gotta get, we gotta get him in. I gotta get, uh, I gotta convince, uh, uh, I almost, I almost said Saber Spark.
01:07:03 Laserbot.
01:07:05 Saber Spark.
01:07:06 Saber Spark, the creator of Tales Get Strolled.
01:07:09 Ah.
01:07:10 Phonely.
01:07:11 Uh.
01:07:13 He wishes, he wishes.
01:07:15 Instead, he's only the creator of giving Tom a good mattress.
01:07:21 Is that a euphemism?
01:07:23 No, I watched a recent video of Saber's and like at the end there's this little, uh, funny little segment where it's like, ha ha, I have a friend Tom, his back fucking sucks, uh, but I'm using my mattress sponsorship to give him a good back and there's like this little
01:07:39 freedy like animation of Tom and he, it was like a PNG and he just falls over or something and it was funny.
01:07:45 That's very funny actually.
01:07:47 Tom.
01:07:48 Do you remember which episodes that is? I kind of love it.
01:07:51 It was very recent. Um, I'm gonna, I must subscribe to Saber Spark. I'm gonna go to his channel.
01:07:56 Was it on the Saber Spark 64 channel or was it on the main channel?
01:07:59 It was the Pinocchio movie video.
01:08:02 I'm pretty certain.
01:08:04 So it was on his main channel. Um, it was at the end of this.
01:08:07 Um, I just giggled at the visual of the little freedy Tom like just falling on the floor or something.
01:08:14 Let me, oh my god, there it is.
01:08:17 It's at like 16 minutes.
01:08:20 Yeah, yeah.
01:08:21 Oh my god.
01:08:23 16 minutes?
01:08:24 Yeah.
01:08:25 Or 15, 55 ish.
01:08:27 Poor old Tom.
01:08:29 He was originally sleeping on an air mattress and I was like,
01:08:32 Just silently lying down.
01:08:33 Nearly a million people saw him.
01:08:34 Absolutely not Tom.
01:08:35 Okay, I got my terrible little screen grab here.
01:08:38 Tom, what happened?
01:08:42 This is like an insane person room.
01:08:45 He's fallen and he's staying down by choice because these Helix mattresses are so comfy.
01:08:51 They sure are.
01:08:53 Link in the description.
01:08:55 Use our promo code.
01:08:57 Use our promo code.
01:08:58 I hate Helix.
01:08:59 It sucks.
01:09:03 I have no opinion of such a product.
01:09:06 I'm sure it's fine.
01:09:08 I'm sure it's the best mattress I've ever slept on in my entire life.
01:09:12 I mean, I hope it's fine.
01:09:14 My bank account.
01:09:16 My bank account skyrockets.
01:09:18 I'm sure there is a very big difference between like a $50 mattress and a $2,000 mattress.
01:09:24 Sure.
01:09:25 Considering you spend a third of our lives sleeping, it's probably good to invest in a good one eventually when I can afford it.
01:09:32 Not a $2,000 one.
01:09:34 I don't know.
01:09:35 Maybe not.
01:09:36 Yeah, like a $1,000 one.
01:09:37 I think it's like, I heard someone say like, I forget the exact number.
01:09:42 It was something like the quality of like a steak tapers off after like $60 or something.
01:09:48 You never need to spend more than $60 on a steak.
01:09:51 Yeah.
01:09:52 There's only so good.
01:09:55 There's only so much love they can cook it with.
01:09:58 Yeah.
01:09:59 The next thing up is like to boil it in molten gold or something.
01:10:03 Yeah.
01:10:04 Or I think Munchie said something about like, I think, this was obviously a few years ago when Munchie was on the podcast.
01:10:10 He said something about like, he wore like a pair of $100 shoes once and he was like, oh, shit.
01:10:15 It's actually good.
01:10:17 It's actually a different experience.
01:10:19 But like, there probably wouldn't be much of a difference between like a $100 pair and like a $1,000 pair.
01:10:25 Like I think by the time you hit like a hundred or maybe even like a little lower than that, you've like reached peak shoes already.
01:10:30 And then everything extra is just for show, I guess.
01:10:33 Just to brag about how much you spent on them.
01:10:35 Yeah.
01:10:36 I wonder what the threshold is for mattresses.
01:10:38 Got to hit the low end of like the good quality.
01:10:41 I feel like a pretty like basic mattress is like, what, like 200 bucks?
01:10:48 For like, not a shitty mattress, but not like a good mattress either.
01:10:52 Just like a normal mattress.
01:10:54 Yeah.
01:10:55 I have no complaints about my mattress, which I think was like 200.
01:11:00 I mean, my mattress is fine.
01:11:02 It's probably not even a hundred.
01:11:05 But like my back also fucking sucks all the time.
01:11:09 If I did like shell out like 800 bucks or something for like a pretty nice one, it would probably improve my quality of life.
01:11:17 I used to sleep on a mattress that was too soft and I had back pain all the time.
01:11:24 And now I don't.
01:11:25 Too soft.
01:11:26 It was too soft.
01:11:27 It was too soft.
01:11:30 How would you lay?
01:11:32 What would happen?
01:11:35 Well, I would just, I would lie down.
01:11:37 I sleep on my stomach usually.
01:11:39 So I would just be lying down and my back would just hurt.
01:11:43 And sometimes I would try to like support my middle back.
01:11:48 I would try to like put like pillows underneath my like stomach to like sort of prop up the middle of my back to sort of prevent it from like kind of bowing down in the middle, you know.
01:12:00 And that didn't work.
01:12:04 The mattress just did not support me.
01:12:06 And I think it was sort of bowing under my weight because it was too soft and it led to me sleeping with a bent spine and I would be in pain all the time.
01:12:17 I don't often sleep.
01:12:18 Actually, I find it very difficult to sleep face down.
01:12:22 I usually sleep face down.
01:12:23 That's just how I've always done it.
01:12:25 I like sleeping on my side.
01:12:27 That's the perfect.
01:12:28 So sometimes I sleep on my side.
01:12:30 No, I usually sleep.
01:12:31 No, face down.
01:12:32 Face down for life, baby.
01:12:36 That just makes it easier for somebody to suffocate you.
01:12:39 Because your nose is already in the pillow.
01:12:42 I suffocate myself.
01:12:43 I sleep face down and I pull the covers all the way up over my head like a fucking freak.
01:12:47 Damn.
01:12:48 You like your little cave system?
01:12:50 Yeah.
01:12:52 And I'll have a little gap.
01:12:53 I'll have a little gap in the between the sheet and the mattress to let my nose poke out so I can breathe air.
01:13:01 I remember when I was young, I had this idea to make a sauna out of my duvet.
01:13:14 So I would wrap it tight so that there was no air coming in so that it would just get hotter and hotter as my body heat just reverberated around.
01:13:28 And it became like a sauna in there and I would just stay there for a long time and then I would open it up and I would like, oh, wow.
01:13:36 I don't know why I did that.
01:13:37 Wow.
01:13:38 But it was a fun experience.
01:13:40 That sounds terrible.
01:13:42 I would hate to be like wrapped up in a blanket and get really hot and sweaty because of my body heat.
01:13:49 I don't think I would do it to go to sleep.
01:13:51 I think I would just do it sometimes.
01:13:55 Obviously, to sleep, I would not put myself in a suffocatable situation.
01:14:05 Understandable, yeah.
01:14:07 Yeah, it's not what you want.
01:14:12 Sorry, I'm still looking at Tails Get Strolled.
01:14:16 I'm still looking at all these cool coyotes.
01:14:19 I think I'm going to draw a coyote.
01:14:23 A lot of these artists draw him with like very, he's like muscular.
01:14:28 Like he's got like a very human sort of like musculature.
01:14:31 I don't think I'm going to do that.
01:14:33 I think I'm going to draw him like he looks in the cartoons, you know, noodley.
01:14:40 It's just seems more canonical.
01:14:45 This is my opinion.
01:14:48 I think that's what I'm going to do.
01:14:50 Also, it's easier because drawing muscles is hard.
01:14:56 Hey, do you want to see a very early Gib drawing from 2007?
01:15:02 Sure.
01:15:04 Because I was looking through a bunch of my old art and I wanted to like try and figure out using context clues
01:15:11 on where it was stored and what the skill level looks like, how old it is.
01:15:16 And I believe that this, this is 2007.
01:15:21 Whoa.
01:15:24 This is so like Dominic Deegan.
01:15:29 You know what that is?
01:15:30 I don't know.
01:15:33 I was a big fan of Dragon Ball and I think some other things.
01:15:42 I think I was reading one piece as well.
01:15:45 I made an anime character and I didn't know how to draw their eyes,
01:15:48 but I think I drew them here better than I do currently.
01:15:53 Dominic Deegan is an old webcomic that was very like how to draw manga looking.
01:16:03 It was controversial for a number of reasons, not least of which was that his art never improved
01:16:11 despite years and years and years of practice.
01:16:17 Well, when you've reached perfection immediately.
01:16:19 Exactly.
01:16:21 Exactly.
01:16:25 So 2007 I would have been,
01:16:32 what the fuck is year?
01:16:35 Well, that was 2007.
01:16:37 I would have been 14.
01:16:39 It was 14 year old Gib art.
01:16:41 Wait, are you 29?
01:16:43 Will be this year, yeah.
01:16:45 Okay, okay, yeah.
01:16:48 I guess that checks out.
01:16:50 Who is this sword guy?
01:16:52 Girl?
01:16:54 It's supposed to be a guy.
01:16:55 I think I drew the jacket like that because it's supposed to be like loose,
01:17:00 like it's like loosely hanging,
01:17:03 but I didn't understand that it should be hanging lower.
01:17:06 So it looks like a breast.
01:17:07 It does kind of.
01:17:09 That's how wacky.
01:17:11 How wacky.
01:17:13 And those double swords.
01:17:15 I think I was like, I was writing a manga.
01:17:18 I had drawn a bunch of panels,
01:17:21 which I still need to like scan in,
01:17:24 which I think were also around 2007, 2008,
01:17:29 where I think I watched Princess Mononoke
01:17:32 and I had been reading Dragon Ball in one piece
01:17:34 and I decided I'm going to make a manga.
01:17:38 And it's, I'm discovering it again.
01:17:41 It's like, oh, this was cool.
01:17:43 I had like a notebook of like the story beats of the entire story.
01:17:48 And it's like, they go into the future at one point
01:17:51 and it's basically Jack and Daxter too, exactly the same.
01:17:55 Yeah.
01:17:57 And it's like the future city,
01:17:59 but these guys are, it's, I think it's like,
01:18:01 it starts off as Princess Mononoke with that sort of
01:18:06 the old, the spirits in the forest
01:18:10 and the town with the log walls.
01:18:14 And then they go into, they fight stuff as demons.
01:18:17 Then they go into the future and it's Jack too.
01:18:19 And in the future, Jack too, there's also demons.
01:18:21 They're the metalheads,
01:18:22 but they're called something different because I made them
01:18:24 and it's my idea actually.
01:18:26 That's right.
01:18:27 And then it goes further into the future.
01:18:30 No, it doesn't, it goes into a different dimension,
01:18:32 which is real life, human world,
01:18:35 where a character who is a self-insert,
01:18:37 who is like really upset and gets bullied and hates everyone,
01:18:42 gets infected by demonic powers
01:18:45 and becomes venom from Spider-Man, essentially.
01:18:48 And then they fight and they fight.
01:18:53 I can't remember what happened,
01:18:55 but there's also a Darth Vader character
01:18:57 and there's space and I want to make that.
01:19:01 I want to make a real comic.
01:19:03 I want to make the stupid 14-year-old idea real
01:19:08 because I have the power.
01:19:11 Do they come to the real world
01:19:14 and they find your self-insert
01:19:16 who's sitting there drawing the comic
01:19:18 and they're like, hey, stop putting bad,
01:19:21 stop putting conflict in our story
01:19:23 and you're like, no, I'm edgy and I'm going to take it out on you.
01:19:26 Raw and you turn into a venom and then you fight.
01:19:31 That character, I don't think it was like a literal self-insert.
01:19:34 It wasn't my name, but it was like the character,
01:19:37 I was designing a character and I'm like, okay,
01:19:39 so they're a teenager and they get bullied a lot
01:19:42 and they're very quiet and it's just a list of things that are me
01:19:47 and they hate life and they hate everyone.
01:19:49 They would kill and the demon energy,
01:19:52 they would kill if they could, but they can't.
01:19:55 But then from the past, from another dimension, the demons come in,
01:19:58 I get bitten by a demon and it is fueled by rage
01:20:02 and because I'm so angry, this character I need,
01:20:05 this character is so angry.
01:20:07 They involve the demonic power and they become super powerful.
01:20:11 But at some point, they become a good guy like Vegeta
01:20:19 because they learn to be friends, they learn to have friends
01:20:23 and that's what it's all about.
01:20:26 But they still retain the ability to turn into an evil angry venom
01:20:30 so they become like a useful character in the fights
01:20:35 against the Darth Vader called Lord Zenith
01:20:38 because he's like, I looked in the dictionary
01:20:40 for something that began with Zenith and Zenith sounded cool
01:20:45 and it also meant really like the most.
01:20:47 It's like, Lord Zenith, that's my main guy.
01:20:51 It's not the worst name I've ever heard.
01:20:54 Ah, it's so cool, look at all those notes.
01:20:59 My handwriting is abysmal.
01:21:01 I can't write a single letter correctly.
01:21:05 But I could still read it somehow.
01:21:08 Well, la di da.
01:21:11 Yeah, I'm something of an artist.
01:21:13 I've been drawing since I was one.
01:21:15 Look who made a little notebook about some stuff.
01:21:20 Yeah, look at it.
01:21:21 Look at me.
01:21:23 See?
01:21:24 Yeah, all right, done.
01:21:27 Crazy.
01:21:33 Okay, what else?
01:21:35 What else we got?
01:21:36 Topics.
01:21:38 The thing I wanted to talk about a few weeks ago.
01:21:40 Yeah, you mentioned that fucking hour ago.
01:21:44 Oh, I didn't want to go into it immediately.
01:21:47 No, no, no, I mean, yeah, sure.
01:21:49 I watched a show, a very good show,
01:21:52 about animation that came out two years ago.
01:21:55 So I'm late to the party, but keep your hands off Isoquin.
01:22:00 Oh, yeah, I saw that.
01:22:01 Oh, I still haven't seen that one,
01:22:03 but I've been recommended it by a number of people
01:22:07 and it sounds like it probably would like it.
01:22:09 Yeah, well, I watched the first episode.
01:22:14 Yeah.
01:22:15 Yeah, I watched the first episode when it like first aired
01:22:18 and I gave it a 10 on Mal
01:22:20 and then I'm like, I'll watch for rest of us later
01:22:23 and I didn't actually watch it until my birthday in February.
01:22:27 But it's really good, obviously, that's no surprise
01:22:33 because I'm an animator.
01:22:34 I'm going to be biased to a show that's entirely
01:22:37 just a giant love letter to animation and everything.
01:22:41 But the part of a show I didn't expect to love
01:22:43 was just how much focus there was on cutting corners
01:22:48 as an art form to make your animation production better.
01:22:53 You didn't like that?
01:22:55 I do like that.
01:22:56 Okay, good.
01:22:57 I like that, too.
01:22:59 The characters go on big monologues,
01:23:01 like very passionate monologues in one episode
01:23:04 about how like, well, for this shot,
01:23:07 we can just use a still image
01:23:08 and we can just pan the camera a bunch of times
01:23:11 to like imply motion and that way we can get a shot done
01:23:14 in like just a couple of hours
01:23:15 and then this shortcut we can take, we can do this
01:23:18 and like it's just a whole bunch of like
01:23:20 ways to like do things efficiently with less effort
01:23:25 and I'm like, damn, this is the opposite
01:23:28 of what I've been doing my whole life
01:23:30 and it's real obvious shit that I know already
01:23:33 but I've never had it presented by good anime women
01:23:38 telling me to do it.
01:23:40 That's all I needed was to be told by good anime women.
01:23:44 Yeah.
01:23:45 Kanamori is the non-creative technically.
01:23:49 Yeah.
01:23:50 Like she's not an artist
01:23:51 but she gets the other girls into shape
01:23:53 and tells them there's, you know,
01:23:55 like totally practically minded
01:23:57 and is like really strong, like strong force of will.
01:24:05 She whips those idiots into shape.
01:24:07 They're thinking.
01:24:08 Exactly.
01:24:09 But my magical mythical special thing
01:24:13 and she's like, shut up.
01:24:14 We've only got one month to do this.
01:24:16 You can't do that.
01:24:17 You can't do it.
01:24:18 I know.
01:24:19 That's great.
01:24:20 All the people who are artists
01:24:22 who struggle with, you know,
01:24:24 killing babies and all that.
01:24:25 Yeah.
01:24:26 Watch this and they were like, oh my god.
01:24:29 I wish I had a baby killer like her.
01:24:31 I know, I wish I had.
01:24:32 That was my first thought.
01:24:34 I just send a picture of Kanamori to my friend.
01:24:37 I'm like, I need her in my life.
01:24:38 And he's like, for sex?
01:24:39 And I'm like, no.
01:24:40 Fuck you.
01:24:41 No.
01:24:42 I just need someone to keep my ass in shape
01:24:44 and keep me focused on my work.
01:24:46 Yeah.
01:24:47 I need that.
01:24:49 It's what I've been.
01:24:51 It's the piece I've been missing
01:24:52 because I'm the overambitious.
01:24:54 Like every single thing has to be fucking extra.
01:24:57 And for the current project I'm working on,
01:24:59 I was already a bit too late
01:25:00 because I'd already like gotten too deep
01:25:03 into things being over the top, like complex.
01:25:08 So I was able to like reuse some animations
01:25:10 just with different camera movements
01:25:12 to get like extra shots
01:25:13 that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise
01:25:15 that ended up looking really cool.
01:25:17 So that was still something I was able to do.
01:25:19 Thanks to this.
01:25:21 But yeah, I feel a lot better
01:25:23 about approaching other projects in the future
01:25:25 because this project I started seven months ago.
01:25:28 Granted, the first three months,
01:25:30 I had like no time to work on it,
01:25:31 due to pencilmation being taken up my time.
01:25:34 And then having to finish all my commissions
01:25:37 and then edit the one, the PCP episode
01:25:40 with the voicemail reveal
01:25:42 and then edit a bunch of drawcast episodes
01:25:44 before that got streamlined
01:25:46 and then do a DA games video.
01:25:47 And I've had so much shit getting in the way,
01:25:49 but I feel like when I do work on Comzone 4,
01:25:52 which is going to be a much bigger production,
01:25:54 I think I'll really like storyboard it out
01:25:57 from the start to have lots of shortcuts
01:26:00 that look good.
01:26:03 And thanks to Azokin,
01:26:05 which is also just such a fucking charming
01:26:08 and good show, even without all the
01:26:10 really good practical like advice for animators
01:26:13 that's in there.
01:26:14 Yes.
01:26:16 It's just a very pretty location to have.
01:26:19 So that is probably like
01:26:22 easily top three favorite shows of all time
01:26:25 for me right now.
01:26:27 I want a fucking another season.
01:26:29 Yeah, I love that.
01:26:31 I've been meaning to watch it for like two years.
01:26:34 Maybe I should give it a shot.
01:26:37 Oh, I watched the whole thing in one day.
01:26:39 Oh, wow.
01:26:41 Yeah, how many episodes is it? 20?
01:26:43 I think it's 12.
01:26:45 Oh, yeah, it's a short little thing.
01:26:47 Yeah, it's a short.
01:26:49 Okay, well, what's my excuse then?
01:26:52 Just watch one episode, see how you feel.
01:26:55 No.
01:26:57 No, I'll only watch 12 at a time.
01:26:59 Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right.
01:27:01 I have to commit to six hour block.
01:27:04 I mean, I'm not an animator,
01:27:07 but in comics as well,
01:27:09 shortcuts are base and yeah,
01:27:11 I love to cheat.
01:27:13 I love to cheat at everything.
01:27:15 It's just, it's just good.
01:27:17 I like the concept of cheating,
01:27:20 but I don't do it enough.
01:27:22 Yeah, because it's presented
01:27:24 to the audience.
01:27:26 It's something to aspire to,
01:27:28 but you should be proud of.
01:27:30 And that's the thing that I'm like, yeah.
01:27:32 The art form part of it is like
01:27:34 knowing when to do it
01:27:36 for maximum efficiency
01:27:38 of time and resources.
01:27:40 So like, you could skimp on
01:27:42 the most important panel
01:27:44 and have it be underwhelming.
01:27:46 Or you could skimp on like
01:27:48 dialogue scenes, which is much more
01:27:50 like, you know,
01:27:52 like, you know,
01:27:54 scenes, which is much more like
01:27:56 a smart thing to do.
01:27:58 Skimp on everything that isn't like the money shot.
01:28:00 And then people will remember
01:28:02 the money shot and they won't mind
01:28:04 that there's so many panels
01:28:06 or sort of like whatever.
01:28:08 Yeah, basically.
01:28:10 I don't know if that's what I was thinking
01:28:12 when I did Clarissa,
01:28:14 but I did draw that after
01:28:16 watching Isoken, I think.
01:28:18 That was 2020.
01:28:20 Clarissa has like, occasionally
01:28:22 a cool big panel where she's got a gun
01:28:24 shooting, tooting.
01:28:26 And then a lot of the other ones are like,
01:28:28 I just need to show that she's going
01:28:30 into this door. It doesn't matter.
01:28:32 Yeah, that's
01:28:34 really, you can
01:28:36 when you
01:28:38 when you block out a panel,
01:28:40 right, you can get away with little
01:28:42 or no background like
01:28:44 90% of the time.
01:28:46 And it's always better
01:28:48 to do that.
01:28:50 One of the problems I had
01:28:52 when I was trying to do,
01:28:54 I was trying to simplify things for my
01:28:56 pony animations back in
01:28:58 2016. I'm like, I'm going to do motion comics.
01:29:00 Because comic dubs
01:29:02 are like a really popular way
01:29:04 to get millions of views.
01:29:06 You just take a comic and you like
01:29:08 speak over it. I'm like, I could do that,
01:29:10 but like, just have things
01:29:12 like move subtly
01:29:14 by like creating them in flash.
01:29:16 But I would always like do full on
01:29:18 backgrounds and shit and it's like,
01:29:20 why?
01:29:22 Why?
01:29:24 You probably got like half as many done as you
01:29:26 could have.
01:29:28 That was like 80% of my time
01:29:30 was spent working on the backgrounds and shit
01:29:32 just posing the character rigs,
01:29:34 was the fucking easy part.
01:29:36 And no one cares except you.
01:29:38 No one cares. Honestly, it looks worse
01:29:40 that way. It would have been better simplified
01:29:44 because it's too much visual clutter.
01:29:46 Oh, but fidelity.
01:29:48 Fidelity.
01:29:50 Oh, no, but the perfect
01:29:52 parallax scrolling
01:29:54 of the layers of the background.
01:29:58 Scientifically accurate.
01:30:00 Or whatever.
01:30:02 Fidelity.
01:30:06 Yes.
01:30:08 I remember, you know, I think
01:30:12 the thing about
01:30:14 that one of them
01:30:16 that whips the others into shape just reminds me
01:30:18 of a sentiment that I have
01:30:20 repeated recently
01:30:22 a few times, which is that
01:30:24 I miss
01:30:26 working on
01:30:28 stuff with like a group
01:30:30 or in like a thing
01:30:32 where it was like
01:30:34 with T-Bap, it was me and Nate doing
01:30:36 stuff and we would both be like, okay,
01:30:38 you got to do this and I'll do this
01:30:40 and like, what can we get done
01:30:42 in like one day? Okay.
01:30:44 Can we do this? All right.
01:30:46 We agree. We will take these
01:30:48 tasks and this is our responsibility.
01:30:50 Okay, break. Let's go do them.
01:30:52 And we'd figure out
01:30:54 like how much can we feasibly
01:30:56 do in one day?
01:30:58 Okay, that's what we'll do. That's the episode.
01:31:00 That sounds fun.
01:31:02 The deadline
01:31:04 is
01:31:06 something that cannot be changed.
01:31:08 And so all you can do is plan
01:31:10 your time
01:31:12 as effectively as possible.
01:31:14 That's how it was. The episode would come out.
01:31:16 We'd be like, well, we want to get the T-Bap
01:31:18 about it done like the same weekend.
01:31:20 So how much can we do
01:31:22 before Sunday?
01:31:24 All right. Yeah, I think I would just
01:31:26 leave it as like as long as it comes out
01:31:28 before the next episode, then
01:31:30 whatever.
01:31:32 Not timeliness. Timeliness was
01:31:34 part of the T-Bap mission statement.
01:31:36 Yeah, I probably would have got more subscribers
01:31:38 if I was quicker.
01:31:40 Perhaps.
01:31:46 Anyway, it's good to be part of a team.
01:31:48 It's good to be part of a well-oiled machine.
01:31:50 Not like the PCP.
01:31:52 Not like the PCP.
01:31:54 Instead, I'm just a
01:31:56 I'm just a
01:31:58 lone freak.
01:32:00 I'm just a lone
01:32:02 gunman.
01:32:04 Just a lone sniper
01:32:06 in the tower.
01:32:08 I don't know what that means.
01:32:10 Pointing your gun at Eleazar.
01:32:12 He's how you get episodes out on time.
01:32:14 You just chuck it at him.
01:32:16 Eleazar is very reliable.
01:32:18 Eleazar slaving over a hot
01:32:20 PCP.
01:32:22 I can just say Eleazar.
01:32:24 With a red dot, like sniper dot around
01:32:26 dangling around his neck
01:32:28 from across the street.
01:32:30 He's so easy to
01:32:32 manipulate. I can just say Eleazar
01:32:34 puts Saul Goodman
01:32:36 on screen and he'll do it.
01:32:38 He knows where to find it.
01:32:40 He's doing it right now.
01:32:42 I saw some
01:32:44 sprite art of
01:32:46 Saul Goodman
01:32:48 in Ace Attorney.
01:32:50 Like him banging the desk like Ace Attorney.
01:32:52 Oh.
01:32:54 That sounds cool.
01:32:56 Was he in the style of Ace Attorney?
01:32:58 Yeah, yeah.
01:33:00 It was just him in the scene
01:33:02 instead of, I guess, Edgeworth.
01:33:04 But it looked like him in that
01:33:06 style and it looked, I was like,
01:33:08 I know that guy. He would.
01:33:10 He would do
01:33:12 law.
01:33:14 I was disappointed that the
01:33:16 Saul Goodman
01:33:18 from Attack on Titan
01:33:20 didn't look like
01:33:22 him much in the anime
01:33:24 when they got to it.
01:33:26 I was annoying.
01:33:28 I'm not familiar with that guy.
01:33:30 You know, I never finished
01:33:32 Better Call Saul
01:33:34 now that I think of it.
01:33:36 Well, it's the last season
01:33:38 is about to come out in like a week.
01:33:40 Oh god, it's not done.
01:33:42 It's not done. It's good.
01:33:44 It's pretty fucking good though.
01:33:46 Probably one of my favorite shows
01:33:48 with live action shows ever, definitely.
01:33:54 Bob Odenkirk is like
01:33:56 pretty, he's pretty old, right?
01:33:58 Maybe like 60 something.
01:34:00 Maybe not 60.
01:34:02 Didn't he like collapse on set
01:34:04 this past year? Like he had a health
01:34:06 scare or something?
01:34:08 He had a heart incident
01:34:10 quote unquote.
01:34:12 I mean,
01:34:14 most people are just like heart attack.
01:34:16 He's like, well, technically,
01:34:18 doctors say incident, but I mean,
01:34:20 what difference is it?
01:34:22 Yeah.
01:34:24 It was well filming the final
01:34:26 season of Better Call Saul.
01:34:28 Wow. Okay.
01:34:30 Yeah, this
01:34:32 the manga one just
01:34:34 looks exactly like Bob Odenkirk.
01:34:36 Yeah.
01:34:38 What?
01:34:40 Why does he do that?
01:34:42 What is that tech on Titan?
01:34:44 I think he must
01:34:46 I feel like, yeah, he could have just been
01:34:48 looking at Bob Odenkirk and
01:34:50 it's close enough that I feel like
01:34:52 this could be not an accident.
01:34:54 Aren't the Titans
01:34:56 usually have no hair
01:34:58 at all or very little hair?
01:35:00 It depends. This feels like a very deliberate
01:35:02 hairstyle to give a Titan.
01:35:04 It does. The hairstyle's spot on.
01:35:08 And the face and even the expression
01:35:10 just feels in character
01:35:12 a little bit.
01:35:14 I mean, I heard Better Call Saul is,
01:35:16 I heard that it's really popular in China.
01:35:18 It's possible it's popular in Japan too.
01:35:20 I don't know.
01:35:22 Better Call Titan.
01:35:26 Better Attack Saul.
01:35:28 Maybe when the last season comes out,
01:35:30 I will try and remember how far
01:35:32 through it I was and
01:35:34 go back and finish it.
01:35:36 I like Bob.
01:35:38 I like Bob and David.
01:35:40 He's a good man.
01:35:42 Fun fact.
01:35:44 Before I had seen Breaking Bad
01:35:46 or Better Call Saul,
01:35:48 I saw an animation called Better Call Saul.
01:35:52 Which is
01:35:54 a Monsters Inc. version.
01:35:56 Oh, Better Call Sully?
01:35:58 Yeah.
01:36:02 Call him as in quell him.
01:36:04 As in excise him.
01:36:06 Better Call Saul.
01:36:08 It's literally just
01:36:10 a scene
01:36:12 like the scene from the end of season one
01:36:14 just with Monsters Inc.
01:36:16 And it's like word for word.
01:36:18 Exactly the same.
01:36:20 Except they only changed
01:36:22 the names of a few characters.
01:36:24 They just swapped a couple of words around.
01:36:26 But most of the dialogue is identical.
01:36:28 And it's accurate
01:36:30 to both franchises.
01:36:32 Which is really funny.
01:36:36 And so after I saw that,
01:36:38 not knowing anything about the show,
01:36:40 I'm like Better Call Saul. More like
01:36:42 Better Fuck Chuck.
01:36:44 And of course- Better Feed Snead.
01:36:46 Better Feed Snead.
01:36:48 I didn't know that there was a character called Chuck
01:36:50 in the show who does get fucked.
01:36:52 And my friends thought that was very funny
01:36:54 that I didn't understand
01:36:56 the clever joke I made.
01:36:58 His brother is Chuck, right?
01:37:00 Yeah, his brother.
01:37:02 His funny brother.
01:37:04 So yeah, this is made by
01:37:06 Yukino Joe who I recently
01:37:08 found out
01:37:10 is a bit of a crazy person.
01:37:12 Wait, is this the guy who made the
01:37:14 Dog of Wisdom?
01:37:16 He did the...
01:37:18 I'm my original character, Blonic.
01:37:20 You know?
01:37:22 I found... I recently
01:37:24 saw someone
01:37:26 bemoaning the fact that the guy
01:37:28 who made the Dog of Wisdom was like
01:37:30 a weirdo NFT dude or something.
01:37:32 Yes, it's not just that.
01:37:34 If you look at his Twitter, it's like
01:37:36 he's trying to speedrun
01:37:38 having every single bad take imaginable.
01:37:40 Alright, let's see here.
01:37:42 He's attacked... I need to find his account.
01:37:44 Because
01:37:46 I don't know exactly what it's called
01:37:48 but I did like
01:37:50 some people responding to him calling him out.
01:37:52 Is it Cool the Joe?
01:37:54 Yeah, Cool the Joe sounds right.
01:37:56 It's linked on his YouTube.
01:37:58 He was attacking...
01:38:00 He's only got 2,000 followers on Twitter.
01:38:02 Yeah, I'm assuming it's in a Twitter account
01:38:04 he doesn't advertise much.
01:38:06 But he had a bunch of tweets attacking
01:38:08 Disney employees who were criticizing
01:38:10 Disney River anti-gay stuff
01:38:12 and he was on the side of
01:38:14 he was attacking them for criticizing
01:38:16 Disney which is like, why?
01:38:18 He was attacking animators
01:38:20 and storyboarders who wanted
01:38:22 the new deal for animation
01:38:24 or whatever it's called.
01:38:26 I see him being a little whiny, a little
01:38:28 bitch about it here.
01:38:30 He just seemed to be attacking animators
01:38:32 and storyboarders who want better
01:38:34 workers rights
01:38:36 and promoting NFTs
01:38:38 and all his NFTs got stolen too apparently
01:38:40 but he still supports them.
01:38:42 He's just doubling down.
01:38:44 No, NFTs are good.
01:38:46 I swear.
01:38:48 Well...
01:38:50 Die.
01:38:52 That's all I gotta say.
01:38:54 He's got a Hexagon
01:38:56 Icons
01:38:58 but I'm not sure
01:39:00 if it's like actually
01:39:02 an NFT or if it's just
01:39:04 a regular one that just happens to be
01:39:06 Hexagonal
01:39:08 I can't tell.
01:39:10 No, when I scroll up
01:39:12 it has a circular outline.
01:39:14 It's a fake Hexagon.
01:39:16 Why fake Hexagon?
01:39:18 Is it because NFTs got stolen?
01:39:20 That would be so funny.
01:39:22 If he's like, well I know they got stolen
01:39:24 but I'm still going to use it.
01:39:26 I'm just going to make it a Hexagon.
01:39:28 I don't know.
01:39:30 Look, that's all poor little psycho troll
01:39:32 didn't like that I called her out for being
01:39:34 a horrible friend and a lazy ass shit animator
01:39:36 You're a fucking slime.
01:39:38 Whoa, slime.
01:39:40 Sorry.
01:39:42 Wait, slime? What?
01:39:44 What?
01:39:46 Hold on.
01:39:48 I see him saying what the fuck
01:39:50 to Ross's
01:39:52 he put animators
01:39:54 into Family Guy?
01:39:56 Yeah, he's just been like
01:39:58 attacking every animator.
01:40:02 That was just a thing I read earlier.
01:40:04 I don't even know what he's responding to here.
01:40:06 I don't know what he's responding to
01:40:08 but I just
01:40:10 discovered a couple weeks ago that he's like
01:40:12 attacking animators.
01:40:14 He's attacking people in the industry.
01:40:16 He's complaining that
01:40:18 people want Disney to not be
01:40:20 homophobic. He's complaining
01:40:22 that people don't like NFTs.
01:40:26 T's?
01:40:28 NFTs.
01:40:30 I don't know. It's just weird.
01:40:32 Show the animator. I lost all my NFTs
01:40:34 frown face.
01:40:38 Is that a tweet from this guy?
01:40:40 That's his tweet.
01:40:42 And he retweeted it, I guess.
01:40:44 Why would you
01:40:46 It's
01:40:48 the Cuphead show
01:40:50 February 22nd. The Cuphead show
01:40:52 is terrible and NFTs are good.
01:40:54 Okay.
01:40:56 Yeah, that's weird.
01:40:58 That's a weird take too.
01:41:00 The war is bullshit.
01:41:02 Hulu Animaniacs pushed for
01:41:04 this war. Animation workers
01:41:06 do not deserve a new deal.
01:41:08 Okay.
01:41:10 What? Is he talking about the war
01:41:12 in Ukraine? Probably.
01:41:14 Is he blaming on Hulu Animaniacs
01:41:16 reboot?
01:41:18 Maybe. I feel like that can't be it.
01:41:20 He's got to be referring to the
01:41:22 animation stuff as a war going on.
01:41:26 Animators want better pay.
01:41:28 Oh, how dare you start a war.
01:41:30 I wonder what he meant by this
01:41:32 just screenshotting Biden
01:41:34 mentioning that we're back in the Paris climate agreement
01:41:36 and he just
01:41:38 screenshotted it and didn't say anything. What does that mean?
01:41:40 Did Biden put a fucking
01:41:42 It's weird for
01:41:44 the POTUS to put a little
01:41:46 colon P. I'll give him that.
01:41:48 I'll give him that.
01:41:50 That's not real.
01:41:52 That doesn't feel real.
01:41:54 Is that real?
01:41:56 Is that real?
01:41:58 I think
01:42:00 it's impossible
01:42:02 and therefore I will not look into it.
01:42:04 Hold on. We're
01:42:06 back in the
01:42:10 Paris climate
01:42:12 agreement colon P.
01:42:14 No results.
01:42:16 I don't think it's real.
01:42:20 So that just makes the tweet
01:42:22 even more mysterious.
01:42:24 What is he trying to say with this?
01:42:26 He probably found it
01:42:28 and assumed it was real and then he was like
01:42:30 look at this fucking president.
01:42:32 Look at this
01:42:34 groomer president using emojis
01:42:36 to make
01:42:38 to sexualize children
01:42:40 somehow.
01:42:42 Typical Democrat.
01:42:46 He's being all cutesy
01:42:48 but he's got an agenda.
01:42:52 He's trying to turn me gay with this little
01:42:54 with this little tongue sticking out emoji.
01:42:56 Well it's not going to work.
01:42:58 I'm going to turn him gay first.
01:43:00 Then we'll see.
01:43:02 I had an opportunity to put
01:43:04 Dog of Wisdom on Disney Channel.
01:43:06 I made an NFT instead of doing that.
01:43:08 NFTs don't seem that sick when compared to the
01:43:10 acceptable idea of success
01:43:12 where big money feels entitled to be so invasive
01:43:14 and then drag your corpse around
01:43:16 when you're gone.
01:43:18 I don't give a fuck what people say.
01:43:20 I've been condescending for a year.
01:43:22 I made the right decision.
01:43:24 What?
01:43:28 He made a tweet
01:43:30 where he says I'm against NFTs now.
01:43:32 Okay.
01:43:34 Wait, did he say that?
01:43:36 He literally said that.
01:43:38 It wasn't April Fools.
01:43:40 It was November 4th.
01:43:42 November 4th.
01:43:44 Last year.
01:43:46 I don't know, I'm just scrolling.
01:43:48 He's a hard man to figure out.
01:43:50 I like his animations.
01:43:52 They're funny. They tickle me.
01:43:54 The man, though.
01:43:56 Seems like he's mad.
01:43:58 Seems like he kind of made the wrong choice
01:44:00 by making an NFT instead of
01:44:02 working for Disney.
01:44:04 Maybe he's mad that he did that.
01:44:06 But he's got to double down.
01:44:08 Because then he lost all his NFTs.
01:44:10 Lol.
01:44:14 Okay, what a weirdo.
01:44:16 Okay, seems like...
01:44:18 You know what?
01:44:20 Seems like he's coming from a place
01:44:22 where things did not go so well for him.
01:44:24 And I think that's
01:44:26 funny.
01:44:28 I genuinely hope whatever is
01:44:30 going on in his head
01:44:32 he calms down.
01:44:34 Because it just seems like
01:44:36 he's living a stressful life and he doesn't have to.
01:44:38 He does seem
01:44:40 miserable
01:44:42 and confused.
01:44:44 I'd like him to not be miserable
01:44:46 and confused.
01:44:48 It's not too late.
01:44:50 Alright, well
01:44:52 we got to kill him.
01:44:54 What I'm saying, the way we can fix this
01:44:56 is to end him.
01:45:00 Execution.
01:45:02 Let me boot up Elden Ring.
01:45:04 I'm going to go find him.
01:45:06 Draw him into your comic.
01:45:08 Draw him into my...
01:45:10 Are you that guy who did that dog
01:45:12 in a bar?
01:45:14 Yes, stab.
01:45:16 He says,
01:45:18 and I'm also a demon
01:45:20 with demon powers.
01:45:22 Prepare to fight.
01:45:24 Prepare to fight.
01:45:26 I'd rather not prepare.
01:45:28 Dies.
01:45:34 Alright.
01:45:36 Let me check my little notes.
01:45:38 Did I have anything else
01:45:40 to mention today?
01:45:42 No.
01:45:44 Yeah,
01:45:46 I...
01:45:48 Lord Ghost things,
01:45:50 people put the backer surveys.
01:45:52 Please fill them out
01:45:54 after I get like a few more.
01:45:56 If there's like three people left
01:45:58 that just haven't responded
01:46:00 then I'll just send what I can
01:46:02 and deal with it later.
01:46:04 How did we get
01:46:06 on the subject of the dog man?
01:46:08 We mentioned
01:46:12 Better Call Saul
01:46:14 and then Better Call Saul
01:46:16 and then the guy who made it.
01:46:18 And I'm playing Elden Ring.
01:46:20 I'm streaming Elden Ring by the way.
01:46:22 If you want to watch me play Elden Ring
01:46:24 for the first time and not know what is happening,
01:46:26 you can go to
01:46:28 twitch.tv.com
01:46:30 and watch that.
01:46:32 Yeah.
01:46:34 Maybe what I can do
01:46:36 because my project will be done...
01:46:38 I mean, it's basically done.
01:46:40 It'll be possibly out today
01:46:42 and maybe the NSFW version
01:46:44 will be done before Friday.
01:46:46 I could be streaming Pumpkin Alley.
01:46:50 Maybe I could try and arrange it
01:46:52 to stream it when this
01:46:54 PCP comes out.
01:46:56 Or two hours after whenever people get to this part
01:46:58 in the episode so that they know
01:47:00 to go watch me right now.
01:47:02 That's assuming my husband doesn't have plans
01:47:04 and I looked with that but I could try.
01:47:06 Please do.
01:47:08 I'd watch that.
01:47:10 I would.
01:47:12 I try to watch every video and stream
01:47:14 of people playing Pumpkin Alley.
01:47:16 I know.
01:47:18 I was watching at fucking everything
01:47:20 when the PCP dating sim came out.
01:47:22 That was such a...
01:47:24 The two weeks after we released that
01:47:26 was so nice just watching everything
01:47:28 seeing all the reactions and stuff.
01:47:30 Yeah.
01:47:32 That was so fun.
01:47:34 That was so cool.
01:47:36 That was radical.
01:47:38 I should have retweeted
01:47:40 the dating sim on April Fools.
01:47:42 Oh yeah.
01:47:44 Two year anniversary at this point.
01:47:46 Yeah.
01:47:48 Guys, it's officially been two years
01:47:50 since the PCP was good.
01:47:52 That's what they say.
01:47:54 It's been longer than that.
01:47:56 Let's be honest.
01:47:58 You have to keep turning back the clock
01:48:00 like, when is it going to be good?
01:48:02 I knew it was good.
01:48:04 Surely it was.
01:48:06 The horse cast is still not good.
01:48:08 What the fuck?
01:48:10 You turn the last page and you're like,
01:48:12 huh?
01:48:14 What?
01:48:16 The horse cast is good.
01:48:18 I do like it a lot.
01:48:20 What have I been doing for seven years?
01:48:24 It's scary how British
01:48:26 you sound in the horse cast,
01:48:28 Kim.
01:48:30 That's because I don't
01:48:32 know how I sound now.
01:48:34 I sound like me.
01:48:36 But I definitely...
01:48:38 I haven't noticed the difference, but maybe it's been gradual.
01:48:40 It's definitely gradual.
01:48:42 I didn't talk much
01:48:44 at all.
01:48:46 But I certainly didn't talk
01:48:48 much at all on
01:48:50 the internet
01:48:52 before we started doing podcasts.
01:48:54 But I didn't talk
01:48:56 to Americans ever
01:48:58 before I was doing stuff like that.
01:49:00 So it was like
01:49:02 I'm surrounded by different accents.
01:49:04 I sort of picked them up over time.
01:49:06 My voice
01:49:08 sometime in like the first or
01:49:10 second year of the PCP
01:49:12 changed. There's like an
01:49:14 old Ben voice
01:49:16 and I don't know
01:49:18 I don't know. There's like
01:49:20 I can tell it's like, oh, that's how I used to sound
01:49:22 and this is how I sound now and there's
01:49:24 I don't know what happened to
01:49:26 change it, but like my voice used to be
01:49:28 like deeper.
01:49:30 Your beard is made
01:49:32 deeper and now it's gone.
01:49:34 It's kind of coming back, actually.
01:49:36 It's looking good.
01:49:38 Looking good. I'm down to 170 pounds.
01:49:40 My beard is coming
01:49:42 in.
01:49:44 Things are looking up.
01:49:46 I've got
01:49:48 it's all going
01:49:50 for me. It's all coming my way.
01:49:54 It sounds like you're about to cry.
01:49:56 Well, I mean
01:49:58 no.
01:50:00 Shut up.
01:50:02 It's all coming up.
01:50:04 Things are finally
01:50:06 going to go well for me.
01:50:08 Okay.
01:50:10 What was I talking about?
01:50:12 Do you want to do voicemails?
01:50:14 Yeah.
01:50:16 I have a feeling that some of them might
01:50:18 be bad and I am going to
01:50:20 not acknowledge those.
01:50:22 So
01:50:24 I
01:50:26 understand.
01:50:28 Yes.
01:50:30 You
01:50:32 wait.
01:50:34 Okay, we had
01:50:36 all right. Here we go.
01:50:38 The first voicemail
01:50:40 of the day. I'm going to post these in
01:50:42 general, I guess.
01:50:44 It is called, let me find
01:50:46 the number
01:50:48 uh
01:50:50 five seven
01:50:52 four four five seven.
01:50:54 This is called Breaking News, sorry.
01:50:56 Uh oh, what?
01:50:58 Kingdom Hearts 4
01:51:00 trailer.
01:51:02 I saw a
01:51:04 screenshot of
01:51:06 Sora's new design. I was wondering
01:51:08 what that was from.
01:51:10 That's gotta be fake.
01:51:12 What the fuck?
01:51:14 Let me, this is the tweet
01:51:16 I saw.
01:51:18 He's got normal sized shoes
01:51:20 now. He's no longer
01:51:22 chubby shoes, Mickey Boy.
01:51:24 Is that Kyrie?
01:51:26 Nah, it's a sallyoop.
01:51:28 They made this in response to that really
01:51:30 long video, Shitting on Kingdom Hearts 3.
01:51:32 I bet they did. Kingdom Hearts 3
01:51:34 is a waste of time.
01:51:36 I think that's the video, yeah.
01:51:38 I've been hearing everyone talk about it for the past two weeks.
01:51:40 I love that video. I've watched it like four times.
01:51:44 A waste of effort, I think.
01:51:46 A waste of effort. That's what it is.
01:51:48 Wait, that's eight months ago. Why did I only hear people talk
01:51:50 about that video a couple weeks ago?
01:51:52 That video was okay, but it was very...
01:51:54 I didn't understand
01:51:56 what he was getting at.
01:51:58 I'll be honest, I didn't play
01:52:00 Kingdom Hearts 3,
01:52:02 so I don't even have that strong an opinion.
01:52:04 Oh, no.
01:52:06 I saw it. I saw
01:52:08 Kingdom Hearts 3 being played in my living room
01:52:10 when it was brand new
01:52:12 and
01:52:14 there was something off about it,
01:52:16 and then we found out how short it was
01:52:18 and then we just gave up.
01:52:20 Yeah, it's not
01:52:22 good, but it's all right.
01:52:24 It's not worth the money.
01:52:26 That's definitely the
01:52:28 something I could say. It's not worth the money it costs.
01:52:30 It's not worth $60?
01:52:32 No, not at all.
01:52:34 Oh, plus for $20
01:52:36 or $30 DLC to actually have the rest of the game.
01:52:38 I sort of enjoyed.
01:52:40 Oh, yeah, and you go
01:52:42 DLC to get the real ending.
01:52:44 That guy said, like the only part
01:52:46 of the game that guy said was good, was the DLC.
01:52:48 He really liked the DLC
01:52:50 and like nothing else.
01:52:52 Like the Tangled is world is like
01:52:54 nothing interesting
01:52:56 and the Big Hero 6
01:52:58 world is really boring.
01:53:00 Toy Story World is kind of cool
01:53:02 and parts of the Caribbean
01:53:04 world is like, ah, finally a pirate ship
01:53:06 game that I like.
01:53:08 And I forget
01:53:10 if there was even
01:53:12 anything else.
01:53:14 It was frozen.
01:53:16 Frozen. That was a
01:53:18 boring level. I heard it was bad.
01:53:20 It was just sort of like
01:53:22 really, really
01:53:24 uninteresting.
01:53:26 And then the story doesn't really even exist
01:53:28 until you get to the end.
01:53:30 It's just sort of like
01:53:32 meandering around
01:53:34 and then, oh yeah,
01:53:36 the organization.
01:53:38 Now we can play the game.
01:53:40 But I didn't fight the final boss
01:53:42 because I was like, I don't care.
01:53:44 I don't care about that stuff.
01:53:46 I was surprised to find out
01:53:48 that Kingdom Hearts 3 is not really the end.
01:53:50 It's sort of
01:53:52 it's still setting up for more games.
01:53:54 I kind of thought 3 was supposed
01:53:56 to be the end, but it's not.
01:53:58 So, okay.
01:54:00 Yeah, I think something
01:54:02 something, the end
01:54:04 of the Xehanort trilogy
01:54:06 or whatever.
01:54:08 Some sort of villain
01:54:10 is no longer the main villain
01:54:12 and now it's going to be a different arc
01:54:14 of Kingdom Hearts, I guess,
01:54:16 is the idea.
01:54:18 Yeah, which
01:54:20 it's just weird.
01:54:22 Xehanort is
01:54:24 like, I mean in my
01:54:26 mind, he's the bad guy
01:54:28 and like
01:54:30 I don't know, Kingdom Hearts does not feel
01:54:32 to me like a robust
01:54:34 enough intellectual property to be like,
01:54:36 okay, that was just the first arc of Kingdom Hearts.
01:54:38 Now we're moving on to a whole new
01:54:40 fucking plot.
01:54:42 Well, as you can see in this tweet
01:54:44 the second image, that's Alleyoop.
01:54:46 So this is actually my game
01:54:48 is Pumpkin Alley.
01:54:50 They approached me
01:54:52 after playing the demo and they said
01:54:54 can we make
01:54:56 your game into Kingdom Hearts 4?
01:54:58 And I said, sure, here's all the rights
01:55:00 to my intellectual property
01:55:02 and I didn't want to get paid for it
01:55:04 and they just took it. So if you see a Pumpkin girl
01:55:06 they
01:55:08 it's all theirs. Got it.
01:55:10 Damn. Got it.
01:55:12 Noted.
01:55:14 Yeah, I don't know.
01:55:16 I guess I'll
01:55:18 eagerly await
01:55:20 when this game comes out and then I'll watch
01:55:22 YouTube videos about how bad it is
01:55:24 and I'll get a lot of enjoyment out of that.
01:55:26 I was kind of like
01:55:28 I played the second game
01:55:30 and I enjoyed it. It was a really, really good fun game.
01:55:32 Yeah.
01:55:34 And then I didn't want to play
01:55:36 like the 70 different things
01:55:38 that were
01:55:40 on PSP
01:55:42 and mobile, whatever they were
01:55:44 all over the place.
01:55:46 And so I was like, okay, I'll just buy the third one.
01:55:48 And unfortunately
01:55:50 it was like 12 years.
01:55:52 Yeah, unfortunately they did not design it
01:55:54 to be
01:55:56 playable after you just beat the second game.
01:55:58 You have to be a super fan
01:56:00 to even comprehend anything.
01:56:02 You have to have played all of the secret
01:56:04 like the side things.
01:56:06 The PSP and like the weird like
01:56:08 online the mobile game and all that.
01:56:10 You have to be
01:56:12 at least knowledgeable
01:56:14 about some of the bigger ones
01:56:16 like Chain of Memories or
01:56:18 whatever the fuck that one was.
01:56:20 I did play Chain of Memories
01:56:22 and it was awesome. Not that one.
01:56:24 It was like those other ones. I forget what they're called.
01:56:26 You mean like 368 over two days
01:56:28 and Birth by Sleep.
01:56:30 Birth by Sleep, that's the one.
01:56:32 They probably expect you to have played that
01:56:34 and I didn't. So
01:56:36 it's not much for me in that game.
01:56:38 Is Birth by Sleep the one about
01:56:40 Terra and Aqua and
01:56:42 Ventus?
01:56:44 I think so.
01:56:46 They've fallen asleep and you gotta wake up
01:56:50 and get born.
01:56:52 They've fallen asleep.
01:56:54 Okay, I will.
01:56:56 Thanks.
01:56:58 That's exactly what is
01:57:00 in that game.
01:57:02 Whatever, Kingdom Hearts is
01:57:04 fucking silly.
01:57:06 The trailer's out so maybe
01:57:08 five years from now, Kingdom Hearts 4 will come out.
01:57:10 Ten years, twelve.
01:57:12 That'll be exciting.
01:57:14 Alright, let's do voicemails.
01:57:16 First voicemail
01:57:18 is called
01:57:20 Nate Besman 2022.
01:57:22 Alright.
01:57:24 Three, two, one, go.
01:57:28 I did see that comment
01:57:30 about my usage of the word retarded.
01:57:32 I will never give up
01:57:34 the word retarded. Never.
01:57:36 I won't do it.
01:57:38 The euphemism treadmill has been spinning
01:57:40 along so fast lately.
01:57:42 I will never give up that word.
01:57:44 It is a rude word.
01:57:46 I totally agree. I'm a rude guy.
01:57:48 I'm a rude dude. What can I say?
01:57:50 Okay.
01:57:52 You know what?
01:57:54 I know people
01:57:56 that use the R word.
01:57:58 I personally
01:58:00 have ceased
01:58:02 to use it, but I would be
01:58:04 a hypocrite to get upset
01:58:06 at Nate using it
01:58:08 because there are other people
01:58:10 that use it and I don't
01:58:12 bishot them.
01:58:14 I let it go without comment.
01:58:16 I mean, it is his word.
01:58:18 It is his word.
01:58:20 True.
01:58:22 I didn't get to pass.
01:58:24 Lucky.
01:58:26 Damn.
01:58:28 It's just a hard one.
01:58:30 Of all the words to call someone dumb,
01:58:32 that's just a hard one.
01:58:34 I guess so.
01:58:36 Sometimes I just want to
01:58:38 say it hard.
01:58:40 I don't know.
01:58:42 It's got the R right there.
01:58:44 It's just stupid with a hard R.
01:58:46 Patard.
01:58:48 Patard.
01:58:50 Star Trek Picard.
01:58:52 I don't know.
01:58:54 I've been very
01:58:56 resistant to stop saying it,
01:58:58 but ultimately when it comes to me,
01:59:00 it's dropping words from my vocabulary.
01:59:02 It's just about
01:59:04 the fact that I just don't want to upset people
01:59:06 in my day-to-day conversation and I've just met more
01:59:08 and more people who are upset by it.
01:59:10 I feel like
01:59:12 they've been told to be upset by it
01:59:14 and not because
01:59:16 the word actually gets used in an ableist way
01:59:18 that much compared to
01:59:20 the millions of uses where it's just
01:59:22 I'm like, ah, I'm fucking retarded.
01:59:24 Oh, I dropped something.
01:59:26 That's how I hear the word use my whole life
01:59:28 and I've only ever heard it used in an ableist sense.
01:59:30 A handful of times
01:59:32 really ever.
01:59:34 To me, it doesn't come across that way.
01:59:38 I feel like that's probably
01:59:40 it doesn't offend me.
01:59:46 I was bullied for being neurodivergent
01:59:48 and I had that word thrown at me a bunch
01:59:50 but I didn't care about the word.
01:59:52 I cared that people thought that I was stupid
01:59:54 because I think I'm smart. How dare you say I'm dumb.
01:59:58 I never cared about the word.
02:00:00 I only ever cared about
02:00:02 if I was being bullied for my weird behavior
02:00:04 in high school, I don't know.
02:00:06 The word was the least
02:00:08 of my worries compared to
02:00:10 the knowledge that they've hated me.
02:00:12 That's what I've heard.
02:00:14 That's all language
02:00:16 is that it's not literal
02:00:18 the word, it's the way
02:00:20 it's used
02:00:22 that can rub someone the wrong way
02:00:24 when it's saying I don't like you
02:00:26 can be more damaging than
02:00:28 a swear word hurled at a person.
02:00:34 I agree, but I also feel like
02:00:36 I can
02:00:38 I can swap it out for something else
02:00:40 it's not too difficult.
02:00:42 Whatever I think of like
02:00:44 times when I would say
02:00:46 fucking our word
02:00:48 I would just replace it with stupid
02:00:50 because that's basically the same thing
02:00:52 that's what I mean.
02:00:54 I've been working towards that
02:00:56 I have fucking stupid
02:00:58 I've been saying that more
02:01:00 I haven't completely dropped it
02:01:02 but I'm working my way
02:01:04 out.
02:01:06 Every time someone told me
02:01:08 that it bothered them
02:01:10 that I would use it
02:01:12 I was like okay noted
02:01:14 and I guess
02:01:16 there were enough of those times
02:01:18 I guess it really comes down to the fact
02:01:20 that a word used
02:01:22 can have unintended
02:01:24 effects
02:01:26 even if you don't use it in a disparaging way
02:01:28 some people just feel bad when they hear it
02:01:30 so that has to be
02:01:32 accounted for in deciding
02:01:34 what words to use not just
02:01:36 when you decide to say something to someone
02:01:38 in a certain way to make them feel bad
02:01:40 if you want to do that
02:01:42 but
02:01:44 knowing that there could be collateral damage
02:01:46 and maybe you could shrug
02:01:48 and be like oh people are so sensitive these days
02:01:50 but like I don't know
02:01:52 I guess they are what are you going to do
02:01:54 are you going to be annoying to everyone
02:01:58 I don't know how true this is
02:02:00 I would just hate the idea but like
02:02:02 because I feel like the word
02:02:04 in the mid-2000s was on its way
02:02:06 to just becoming a colloquial word like stupid
02:02:08 where it would have no more offense than that
02:02:10 because
02:02:12 it was becoming casual but then
02:02:14 there was like pushback to keep
02:02:16 the word offensive I feel like
02:02:18 almost
02:02:20 and I feel like
02:02:22 back then no one was really hurt
02:02:24 by the word that I was aware of
02:02:26 but now people seem to be very hurt by it
02:02:28 when I'm like
02:02:30 I have to wonder like is it because of like personal experiences
02:02:32 you've dealt with ableism that have like made you
02:02:34 that sensitive to the word
02:02:36 or is it because you've just been told
02:02:38 over and over that it's bad and you can't say it
02:02:40 if it's the latter
02:02:42 then you're just kind of
02:02:44 making the word hurt people more than it would have
02:02:46 if you just let it go
02:02:48 I feel like it's
02:02:50 more complicated than just a single person's decision
02:02:52 I feel like
02:02:54 in a society where
02:02:56 the R slur is an R slur
02:02:58 and you can't say it
02:03:00 somebody deciding to say it
02:03:02 says something about a person
02:03:04 that like
02:03:06 it maybe makes people feel
02:03:08 like if they're willing to break
02:03:10 social norms
02:03:12 what else are they willing to break
02:03:14 socially?
02:03:16 Bones, skulls, ligaments
02:03:18 I think
02:03:20 it's a gender
02:03:22 gender
02:03:24 I think it's not something you should
02:03:26 like
02:03:28 if somebody says the R slur they're there for
02:03:30 it's not like a deductive thing
02:03:32 but it's like it's understandable
02:03:34 that breaking a social
02:03:36 rule
02:03:38 that is not like written down it's just sort of everybody
02:03:40 decides yes we're not going to do this
02:03:42 it says something
02:03:44 about you as a person that you decide to break it
02:03:46 knowing that it's a rule
02:03:48 that people follow
02:03:50 and that it's you know the consequences of that
02:03:52 might be overblown sometimes
02:03:54 but it's
02:03:56 it's too nuanced to have like
02:03:58 one like either or
02:04:00 I think
02:04:02 language is crazy
02:04:04 and the way we use it and interact with each other
02:04:06 has changed so much over the past few decades
02:04:08 so I don't know
02:04:10 I don't know I just know
02:04:12 people told me that hey the word
02:04:14 is hurtful and I was like
02:04:16 oh okay sorry
02:04:18 but I also
02:04:20 I just worry
02:04:22 the best you can do is just
02:04:24 work on your
02:04:26 and I don't really have an opinion
02:04:28 because it doesn't offend me but
02:04:30 I don't know
02:04:32 I just took people out their word when they said
02:04:34 they didn't like it
02:04:36 I don't know
02:04:38 it's a bad habit for me to be like
02:04:40 why do you really not like it
02:04:42 I shouldn't be saying that
02:04:44 that's not fair
02:04:46 I know what you mean
02:04:48 I just don't know
02:04:50 I'm happy to drop it
02:04:52 it's again it's just gonna take me a while
02:04:54 because I've said it my whole fucking life
02:04:56 I said it back when I was being bullied and stuff
02:04:58 I also said it my whole life
02:05:00 and I never
02:05:02 it's like it's weird that like
02:05:04 weirdly the proportion
02:05:06 of the words usage that's ableist
02:05:08 I feel like is increasing by having people
02:05:10 stop using it in the innocuous way
02:05:12 but whatever
02:05:14 I just worry that
02:05:16 because I know there are some people who don't think
02:05:18 you can say anything at all
02:05:20 like you can't say stupid even
02:05:22 you can't say dumb
02:05:24 I remember Faust Slime had to make a huge apology
02:05:26 apology video because he said naners
02:05:28 which is slang for
02:05:30 bananas
02:05:32 apparently that was too far
02:05:34 and that's fucking
02:05:36 wild to me
02:05:38 that's a little funny
02:05:40 it is a little funny
02:05:42 but like
02:05:44 they call someone stupid
02:05:46 they're not like making a comment
02:05:48 about like their brain function
02:05:50 that they can't control or some shit
02:05:52 they're just calling you foolish
02:05:54 they're just saying that you're acting dumb
02:05:56 not that you're
02:05:58 oh you have a disability
02:06:00 that you can't help haha
02:06:02 like that's not what people are fucking
02:06:04 saying when they use those words
02:06:06 yeah but like it
02:06:08 it's uh
02:06:10 it's complicated
02:06:12 to know how to
02:06:14 like
02:06:16 a single person can't decide
02:06:18 like
02:06:20 the way society should be
02:06:22 and expect people to capitulate
02:06:24 just because
02:06:26 it's like
02:06:28 there's so many moving parts
02:06:30 if the wind tells me
02:06:32 that I shouldn't say a certain word
02:06:34 and it's something I said my whole life
02:06:36 obviously I'm going to be like
02:06:38 ah but I want to say it
02:06:40 and maybe I'll slip up sometimes
02:06:42 but like
02:06:44 if it's consistent and it stays
02:06:46 then I guess I'll just have to stop
02:06:48 saying it
02:06:50 because I live in a society
02:06:52 and the society is a certain way
02:06:54 and it's
02:06:56 sometimes sucks but what am I going to do
02:06:58 okay I don't know
02:07:00 I mean people
02:07:02 I just uh I didn't like it
02:07:04 when people were mad at me
02:07:06 yeah
02:07:08 and I was like well
02:07:10 I know how to avoid this outcome
02:07:12 yeah
02:07:14 I'm offended by people
02:07:16 putting words in my mouth
02:07:18 or putting meaning in my words I guess
02:07:20 but I clearly didn't intend
02:07:22 why can't I be mad at people
02:07:24 for doing that
02:07:26 am I doing that
02:07:28 is that what you're saying
02:07:30 no I'm talking to these hypothetical people
02:07:32 who want to remove all
02:07:34 insults to intelligence in the world
02:07:36 get rid of all of them completely
02:07:38 those are the people I don't like
02:07:40 I hope it's not a slippery slope
02:07:42 I hope that doesn't catch on
02:07:44 I mean
02:07:46 I feel like
02:07:48 I've seen pushback
02:07:50 you can't even insult people
02:07:52 for any amount of
02:07:54 like
02:07:56 it would become so cumbersome
02:07:58 that society would be like
02:08:00 nah we gotta have at least one
02:08:02 we gotta have at least one
02:08:04 so we can actually describe a thing
02:08:06 I've seen pushback against
02:08:08 stupid but I've seen
02:08:10 more
02:08:12 I've seen more
02:08:14 pushback against the pushback
02:08:16 where it's like okay
02:08:18 you could interpret stupid to mean
02:08:20 neurologically
02:08:22 disadvantaged or whatever
02:08:24 but you could also
02:08:26 just be bad decision making
02:08:28 someone could be
02:08:30 poor reasoning
02:08:32 yeah
02:08:34 or dishonest reasoning even
02:08:38 like if you wanted to be
02:08:40 super slippery slope about it
02:08:42 you could worry that the word no
02:08:44 and the concept of
02:08:46 disagreeing would become
02:08:48 like
02:08:50 you would be killed in the street
02:08:52 for disagreeing
02:08:54 and that's where
02:08:56 that's where the logic
02:08:58 would go if you were like super
02:09:00 neurotic about it
02:09:02 I just don't see it
02:09:04 being like an issue in the real world
02:09:06 maybe on Twitter
02:09:08 maybe Twitter and social media will get to a point
02:09:10 where it's just unbearably like
02:09:12 wokescoldy and they will
02:09:14 tear you to limb from limb for doing anything
02:09:16 in particular it's kind of sometimes
02:09:18 I mean it's sometimes like that sometimes like that
02:09:20 I mean I feel like wokescoldy
02:09:22 like
02:09:24 the aftermath
02:09:26 like it's a big hype thing that happens
02:09:28 once because it's the hot
02:09:30 new thing to hate on a person
02:09:32 or whatever because they did something
02:09:34 a social faux pas but then it sort of gets
02:09:36 forgotten and if the person doesn't
02:09:38 run away then they can just continue
02:09:40 to exist and nothing really
02:09:42 happens
02:09:44 well I feel like
02:09:46 we have learned nothing
02:09:48 but maybe that's okay
02:09:50 yes
02:09:52 no I have the F slur pass
02:09:54 because I'm in a gay relationship
02:09:56 but I don't like saying that word anymore
02:09:58 yeah
02:10:00 I said that before a lot
02:10:02 at some point I just sort of
02:10:04 felt weird to say it
02:10:06 I dropped it before
02:10:10 Kai started transitioning
02:10:12 and so
02:10:14 it became
02:10:16 retroactively a gay relationship later
02:10:18 but I'm like I don't feel like saying it
02:10:20 you're trans
02:10:22 I'm not
02:10:24 Kai is trans
02:10:26 Kai is my husband
02:10:28 I thought you said I
02:10:30 no Kai I'm not trans
02:10:32 there's no magic button
02:10:34 that'll make me an 8 foot tall
02:10:36 woman with giant titties
02:10:38 that button doesn't exist and that's the only
02:10:40 trans I'll accept for myself
02:10:42 so
02:10:44 goals
02:10:46 goals yes
02:10:48 who wouldn't want to be
02:10:50 8 foot tall mummy milker
02:10:54 there are two buttons one turns me
02:10:56 into that one turns everyone else
02:10:58 on earth into that I'm pressing
02:11:00 that button
02:11:02 true
02:11:04 that's the button
02:11:06 that's the test
02:11:08 that's the litmus test
02:11:12 I'm also pushing the everyone else button
02:11:14 I
02:11:16 have to think about it for a little while
02:11:18 do you get the F Slayer pass
02:11:20 if you're gay
02:11:22 if you press the button
02:11:24 if you do any gay shit
02:11:26 do you get the R word pass
02:11:28 if you are neurodivergent
02:11:30 I guess so
02:11:32 I guess it would make sense
02:11:34 I was bullied
02:11:36 for me being on
02:11:38 the autism spectrum
02:11:40 but according to people
02:11:42 you can barely tell
02:11:44 you're one of the good ones
02:11:46 I'm one of the good ones
02:11:48 I want to
02:11:50 test it on the outside but I'm neurotypical
02:11:52 I could barely
02:11:54 I could barely even tell
02:11:56 that you're
02:11:58 special
02:12:00 that's a thing
02:12:02 special feels like way more
02:12:04 of a slur to me than the R
02:12:06 word at this point
02:12:08 context of the sort of person who would use
02:12:10 that word so condescending
02:12:12 imagination
02:12:14 that sounds way slimy to me but
02:12:16 oh well
02:12:18 slimy
02:12:20 but like could in
02:12:22 20 years
02:12:24 oh I work in special effects
02:12:26 you can't say that word
02:12:28 could it end up that way if enough people start
02:12:30 using that word
02:12:32 why is it called special effects
02:12:34 it is a bit
02:12:36 not the same but it is a bit weird
02:12:38 to me
02:12:40 you can't say
02:12:42 colored people anymore
02:12:44 but we circled back around
02:12:46 and now people of color is
02:12:48 sort of like the more polite way
02:12:50 it's just the same words
02:12:52 I know it's one of those things where it's like
02:12:54 the people who
02:12:56 the kind of person who says colored people
02:12:58 is typically a pretty sus person
02:13:02 but at the same time it's like
02:13:04 why is the acceptable word
02:13:06 just the same thing but re-arranged
02:13:08 yeah
02:13:10 I didn't get it
02:13:12 I believe it's because the colored
02:13:14 people
02:13:16 term
02:13:18 came from
02:13:20 that community and they said we would like
02:13:22 to be referred to as this we find this acceptable
02:13:24 and everyone was like okay
02:13:26 yeah
02:13:28 just how it was
02:13:30 I don't know why I think they just wanted to reclaim
02:13:32 it maybe
02:13:34 remember when there were takes
02:13:36 about black bodies
02:13:38 remember black bodies
02:13:40 the black body spectrum
02:13:42 no different thing
02:13:44 I don't know
02:13:46 they're in the most pitched
02:13:48 part of
02:13:50 the BLM thing
02:13:52 in like 2020 or whatever
02:13:54 sometimes
02:13:56 some white person with like
02:13:58 some academic background would
02:14:00 say some shit about how
02:14:02 the police are committing violence against
02:14:04 black bodies and they would say it like that
02:14:06 it's like
02:14:08 why are you saying it like that
02:14:10 that is kind of
02:14:12 weird
02:14:14 I guess it was like an academic thing
02:14:16 I don't know it just sounded really bizarre
02:14:18 to hear it in the wild
02:14:20 in my head
02:14:22 that means they killed them and they're dead
02:14:24 that's when you call someone a buddy
02:14:26 I think it was quickly decided
02:14:28 that you know that's a weird way to talk about people
02:14:30 let's not do it anymore
02:14:32 yeah
02:14:34 I'm inclined to agree
02:14:36 I guess they did kill a few people
02:14:38 they did kill a few people
02:14:40 black body radiation is
02:14:42 when something's hot and it
02:14:44 emits
02:14:46 energy
02:14:48 in a spectrum
02:14:50 black body spectrum is useful
02:14:54 for art
02:14:56 for trying things that emit heat
02:15:00 what do you mean
02:15:02 next voicemail
02:15:04 just color it red
02:15:06 just make it red that's my spectrum
02:15:08 black body spectrum
02:15:10 wait a minute
02:15:12 black bodies, black body spectrum
02:15:14 autism spectrum
02:15:16 what
02:15:18 I'm just saying
02:15:20 I don't know if I can post this image
02:15:22 useful tip for artists who want to draw
02:15:24 things glowing hot
02:15:26 if you want to be specific about what temperature
02:15:28 the thing is you can refer to this chart
02:15:30 and grab your hues accordingly
02:15:32 this is interesting
02:15:34 if you want to be scientifically accurate
02:15:36 that's stupid
02:15:38 who wants to be scientifically accurate
02:15:40 exactly
02:15:42 I mean the colors are nice
02:15:44 I guess
02:15:46 but my manga is black and white
02:15:48 oh yeah
02:15:50 because we know
02:15:52 the fruit powers
02:15:54 that magma is hotter
02:15:56 than fire
02:15:58 and that's why akainu was able to kill
02:16:00 ace
02:16:02 we want to make akainu's magma that yellow color
02:16:04 and we don't want to go any
02:16:06 further than the 2100
02:16:08 degree orange
02:16:10 for ace's fire and then you'll know
02:16:12 they did it the other way around
02:16:14 do you remember
02:16:16 akainu was red
02:16:18 yeah he was they fucked it up
02:16:20 they fucked it up
02:16:22 they fucked it up they loved it
02:16:28 sorry
02:16:30 the search for
02:16:32 well this wasn't when I typed black body spectrum
02:16:34 but this popped up
02:16:36 and I have to
02:16:38 I'm just like
02:16:40 to me I have difficulty
02:16:42 picturing the bodies attached to the ends
02:16:44 of the arms so it just looks like a pile
02:16:46 of severed arms
02:16:48 duh
02:16:50 how are they lying there
02:16:52 I feel like they must have taken the pictures
02:16:54 individually
02:16:56 like two at a time
02:16:58 I think they would have had to be arranged in a very uncomfortable way
02:17:00 yeah like the ambient occlusion seems
02:17:02 accurate though where the skin's like touching
02:17:04 unless there was very cleverly
02:17:06 like photoshopped
02:17:08 I feel like maybe one or two of them
02:17:10 for a second I thought these were all the same
02:17:12 hand because they all
02:17:14 kind of have the same sort of nails
02:17:16 but no I don't like everything so
02:17:18 yeah
02:17:20 they do all have the same
02:17:22 and they have the exact same
02:17:24 arm length
02:17:26 yeah they do
02:17:28 these are all the people of the same size
02:17:30 and build
02:17:32 good for them
02:17:34 damn
02:17:36 good for them
02:17:38 alright so that was the first voicemail
02:17:40 yeah that was one voicemail
02:17:42 alright
02:17:44 it's called
02:17:46 Tommy J
02:17:48 three two one go
02:17:50 hey what's up it's me Tommy J
02:17:52 back again with another stellar voicemail
02:17:54 finally
02:17:56 imagine if you will procrastinators
02:17:58 that you are walking along
02:18:00 in a dark and enchanted forest
02:18:02 emphasis on forest
02:18:04 and suddenly
02:18:06 you're all of six and there is a fork in the road
02:18:08 among these paths
02:18:10 are the left path
02:18:12 and the right path
02:18:14 on the left path
02:18:16 is basically you guys
02:18:18 star a new podcast based on
02:18:20 video game development
02:18:22 and you have a variety of guests
02:18:24 not including oblivion fall
02:18:26 for obvious reasons
02:18:28 obvious reasons
02:18:30 of course you have to star a new patreon
02:18:32 which you don't get the residual
02:18:34 people that are already
02:18:36 subscribed and you gotta
02:18:38 change youtube channels
02:18:40 and just change the name
02:18:42 and that'd be okay
02:18:44 what the fuck
02:18:46 that seemed complicated
02:18:48 on the right path
02:18:50 which is the wrong path
02:18:52 but is also the right path
02:18:54 basically you guys
02:18:56 continue business as usual
02:18:58 and slowly but surely been
02:19:00 threatened suicide until
02:19:02 Nate and Tom both come back on the podcast
02:19:04 I guilt them into it
02:19:06 I feel like Nate should probably heed that call
02:19:08 being brothers and all
02:19:10 but we never had concrete proof
02:19:12 that you guys are actually related
02:19:14 so who knows
02:19:16 this was a completely unhinged
02:19:18 voicemail
02:19:20 stupid
02:19:22 the proof is that I've seen both of your surnames independently
02:19:24 through
02:19:26 paypal transactions
02:19:28 oh yeah
02:19:30 at various points that's how I know
02:19:32 how the mystery is gone
02:19:34 if we
02:19:36 if we could use this
02:19:38 if we
02:19:40 rebranded to be a video game
02:19:42 development podcast
02:19:44 we could just use the same
02:19:46 the same patreon
02:19:48 oh yeah we could rebrand the channel
02:19:50 but we couldn't just rebrand the patreon
02:19:52 we would have to make a whole new patreon
02:19:54 it's not like you can change the url
02:19:56 you can change the url
02:19:58 they let you do that
02:20:00 you can change everything and you keep the patrons
02:20:02 they don't go away
02:20:04 I mean we could rebrand
02:20:06 I wouldn't want to rebrand to specifically a game developer thing
02:20:08 because we don't talk about
02:20:10 game development every week
02:20:12 so we would
02:20:14 we would literally just have
02:20:16 less conversations
02:20:18 less podcasts
02:20:20 yeah I would not
02:20:22 two best game developers
02:20:24 bitch about things that aren't
02:20:26 necessarily games
02:20:28 it's like
02:20:30 at that point why do anything
02:20:32 I'm already
02:20:34 at that point
02:20:36 I don't know
02:20:38 the podcast is just
02:20:40 about us talking about whatever
02:20:42 that's all it can ever be
02:20:44 alright next voicemail
02:20:46 is called
02:20:48 Tommy J
02:20:50 Agaj M
02:20:52 3 2 1 go
02:20:54 hey what's up
02:20:56 procrastinators podcast it's me Tommy J again
02:20:58 back at it again with another
02:21:00 stellar voicemail
02:21:02 in this voicemail I'd like to tell you
02:21:04 that the next five voicemails
02:21:06 are all me putting on
02:21:08 different voices so
02:21:10 enjoy so let's skip to six
02:21:12 ahead
02:21:14 I'll give him a chance
02:21:16 I would love for Tommy J to just be lying right now
02:21:18 so that we
02:21:20 it's just actually different people
02:21:22 I suspect this might not actually be
02:21:24 Tommy J
02:21:26 we'll see
02:21:28 we'll upload them at the same time
02:21:30 without his knowledge
02:21:32 I mean I don't actually
02:21:34 remember what Tommy J
02:21:36 sounds like
02:21:38 wait you just heard him
02:21:40 I think this might be an imposter
02:21:44 can you see the time stamps
02:21:46 were these voicemails all uploaded
02:21:48 within a few minutes of each other
02:21:50 no actually
02:21:52 the last two were
02:21:54 uploaded five days ago
02:21:56 and then the next one was five days
02:21:58 and then the one after that
02:22:00 was four days
02:22:02 and then after that three days
02:22:04 three days three days
02:22:06 so no some of these were posted days apart
02:22:08 yeah that makes me think it was a bit because
02:22:10 I think they have to be
02:22:12 because they would know that surely other people
02:22:14 would post voicemails if you spread them out
02:22:16 if you're going to do that you have to post them back to back
02:22:18 if you want to be sure
02:22:20 I think so
02:22:22 I think that clinches it
02:22:24 we didn't even listen to it yet and we know
02:22:26 we've cracked the code
02:22:28 alright the next one
02:22:30 is called
02:22:32 this meme needs to die
02:22:34 three two one go
02:22:36 oh my god
02:22:38 Ben no one cares
02:22:40 no one cares about Trixie
02:22:42 shut the fuck up
02:22:44 ah
02:22:46 okay you're right
02:22:48 and yet we get voicemails about it
02:22:50 I don't think Trixie's been brought up that much recently
02:22:52 there was this one
02:22:54 in a couple of the last
02:22:56 episodes there were some voicemails
02:22:58 about her
02:23:00 yeah voicemails
02:23:02 yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:23:04 well that's what I mean like somebody cares
02:23:06 this person
02:23:08 just brought up Trixie
02:23:10 on the PCP
02:23:12 technically true I understand
02:23:14 I understand the perspective
02:23:16 I understand the perspective
02:23:18 that like I care
02:23:20 more
02:23:22 about hating her than like
02:23:24 regular humans do
02:23:26 that like her
02:23:28 and I can understand why you would think that
02:23:30 but I assure you
02:23:32 every time I say something mean about Trixie
02:23:34 a bunch of absolute
02:23:36 psychopaths
02:23:38 like swarm out of the woodwork
02:23:40 and get like very offended
02:23:42 at me and say mean things to me
02:23:44 and they can't tolerate it
02:23:46 so I promise you there are people
02:23:48 there
02:23:50 there are people
02:23:52 that
02:23:54 do not share
02:23:56 your opinion voicemailer
02:23:58 but your point is
02:24:00 understood
02:24:02 okay
02:24:04 next one is called
02:24:06 I think there's no actual voicemail
02:24:08 I think it's just cyber shell
02:24:10 your videos suck and you just got lucky
02:24:12 you got fame
02:24:14 okay there's no voicemail
02:24:16 damn I can't believe they said that
02:24:18 about me the guest
02:24:20 agree
02:24:22 cyber shell complete hat
02:24:24 complete fraud
02:24:26 most people get lucky
02:24:28 cyber shell is definitely lucky that
02:24:30 some of their videos got big views
02:24:32 but they're good videos
02:24:34 so it was probably gonna happen at some point anyway
02:24:36 I like cyber shell videos
02:24:38 at least the recent ones
02:24:40 I like you know all the things about the sonic
02:24:42 oddities like
02:24:44 the sonic fandom is huge
02:24:46 and they're well made videos that are interesting
02:24:48 and funny like across
02:24:50 he was gonna get some amount of fame
02:24:52 I think he deserves it
02:24:54 I mean he was posting
02:24:56 his old sonic stuff was at a time
02:24:58 when like
02:25:00 I would say maybe if he had posted that same stuff
02:25:02 like years later
02:25:04 maybe it wouldn't have been
02:25:06 as big a hit because it was like
02:25:08 earlier youtube days
02:25:10 but like that's just
02:25:12 what posting be like
02:25:14 I liked the
02:25:16 the exploring chow
02:25:18 video I forget what it was called
02:25:20 I think it was something I bet
02:25:22 yeah that's the one of the new I really like that one
02:25:24 that was a really good video
02:25:26 yeah that one ruled
02:25:28 so there you go that's what I think
02:25:30 next one is called
02:25:32 I have an annoying voice
02:25:34 3 2 1
02:25:36 go
02:25:38 yes I use it
02:25:40 for the strength
02:25:42 of an unicorn
02:25:44 he shall eat up
02:25:46 some nations
02:25:48 his enemies
02:25:50 and shall break their bones
02:25:52 and pierce them
02:25:54 through with his
02:25:56 arrows
02:25:58 was that void gazer
02:26:00 I mean doid gazer
02:26:02 maybe
02:26:04 that's one of the quotes from
02:26:06 phantom's revenge
02:26:08 my favorite
02:26:10 work on your voice
02:26:12 it could be way more annoying
02:26:14 you could do some run for the cube type shit
02:26:16 if you wanted
02:26:18 run for the cube
02:26:20 it's the guy with the gummy rat who goes
02:26:22 run away from the cube boy
02:26:24 he talks like that
02:26:26 that does not ring a bell at all
02:26:28 oh god
02:26:30 well now I sound like a fucking freak
02:26:32 you know
02:26:34 the rat when the cube boy
02:26:36 sure
02:26:38 of libyan fall
02:26:40 I'll just fucking link it
02:26:42 sure
02:26:44 run for the cube
02:26:46 oh wow it's real
02:26:48 5 seconds of that will make you scream probably
02:26:50 hello
02:26:52 oh god
02:26:54 yeah okay I hear it
02:26:56 I hear it
02:26:58 that's unfortunate
02:27:00 alright I posted the next one
02:27:02 the next one is called
02:27:04 go
02:27:06 hey
02:27:08 do you think that christine
02:27:10 would have been able to finish this game
02:27:12 because I'm fucking gay
02:27:14 no
02:27:16 no I don't think she could be that
02:27:18 who christine
02:27:20 no I think probably
02:27:22 I heard black christine
02:27:24 I guess I meant to say that
02:27:26 do you think that christine
02:27:28 yeah yeah
02:27:30 we don't talk about
02:27:32 we don't talk about black christine
02:27:34 no
02:27:36 I think to beat phantom's revenge
02:27:38 you need
02:27:40 grit
02:27:42 gumption
02:27:44 fortitude
02:27:46 strength of character
02:27:48 moral fiber
02:27:50 backbone
02:27:52 you need a brain a heart
02:27:54 and a dick
02:27:56 and christine has none of those things
02:27:58 so
02:28:00 she can't do it
02:28:02 you fool
02:28:04 but I guess we'll never know
02:28:06 brain a heart a dick and no sex
02:28:08 in vet order

02:31:04 sure it happened this week but it happened sometime
02:31:06 fairly recently
02:31:08 I got the unfollow from deadly comics
02:31:10 and that made me really sad
02:31:12 oh what I love deadly comics
02:31:14 I love deadly comics too
02:31:16 but you know what I deserve it
02:31:18 I am useless
02:31:20 I am nothing
02:31:22 what is the point of following me there is none
02:31:24 so you know what he was right
02:31:26 you know what he was right to do it
02:31:28 you know when you follow
02:31:30 Ben Steyn your twitter timeline
02:31:32 is wailing and gnashing of teeth
02:31:34 from one man
02:31:36 he stuck it out for years
02:31:38 uh but uh I don't know
02:31:40 sometime in the last
02:31:42 couple weeks I guess
02:31:44 either something
02:31:46 bugs him or maybe he was just like
02:31:48 I don't even know who this guy is
02:31:50 why do I follow this guy
02:31:52 is chris raygun still following me
02:31:54 I'm curious
02:31:56 Chris raygun comics follows me still
02:31:58 oh well
02:32:00 so I think it's I think you must have
02:32:02 you must have struck something
02:32:04 you must have done a Ben Steyn
02:32:06 man like it well that's stupid
02:32:08 I maybe uh yeah I mean
02:32:10 it's possible
02:32:12 that my uh Trixie negativity
02:32:14 might have been the thing
02:32:16 probably
02:32:18 it seems possible
02:32:20 I would say
02:32:22 I mean
02:32:24 I would hope
02:32:26 I mean why would they even care
02:32:28 but maybe they just don't like seeing posts about
02:32:30 like that
02:32:32 posts about like hey just fuck somebody maybe they just
02:32:34 maybe they see it and they're like well this is just frivolous
02:32:36 this is just a waste of my time and you know what it is
02:32:38 so he was right
02:32:40 with his decision
02:32:42 uh
02:32:44 and I support it
02:32:46 don't do that on my timeline
02:32:48 to follow his example you know what
02:32:50 it's fair enough
02:32:52 I simply have nothing of value
02:32:54 to contribute
02:32:56 so all I can do is spew bile
02:32:58 that's right
02:33:00 but I mean if spewing bile is what I
02:33:02 can do then
02:33:04 I'll spew till the cows come
02:33:06 spew away
02:33:08 basically
02:33:10 um
02:33:12 next one is called

02:34:24 that this
02:34:26 I I I mean
02:34:28 whatever this is funny
02:34:30 this is funny
02:34:32 I like the implication that being mad
02:34:34 at someone implies that you're old
02:34:36 I
02:34:38 I
02:34:40 I tell that I tell that story
02:34:42 when someone asks me
02:34:44 Ben why are you so mad what did Trixie
02:34:46 people just legitimately still ask me like
02:34:48 what did she do like what has she ever done
02:34:50 to you like they ask me because they
02:34:52 don't know and then I have to be like
02:34:54 well and then I trot out this old
02:34:56 fucking story because
02:34:58 they fucking ask
02:35:00 I don't I don't bring it up
02:35:02 apropos of nothing
02:35:04 but it's true and it still
02:35:06 makes me mad
02:35:08 anyway next one is called
02:35:10 Ben's weekly reminder play
02:35:12 deltarune chapter 2
02:35:14 okay
02:35:16 next one is called Ben what did you think
02:35:18 of the Odin flashback with Roger
02:35:20 there's no there's
02:35:22 no voicemail it's just a question I
02:35:24 liked it
02:35:26 it was cool I I really
02:35:28 liked the Odin flashback the whole thing
02:35:30 learning about Odin and then meeting
02:35:32 seeing all
02:35:34 seeing young Roger was really
02:35:36 really cool it was
02:35:38 I did like it Odin
02:35:40 was I don't know
02:35:42 cool it's cool that he like
02:35:44 became a dad
02:35:46 while on board the
02:35:48 I mean he was an
02:35:50 totally insane character
02:35:52 like when he's introduced
02:35:54 he's so fun he was fun
02:35:56 um
02:35:58 he's just like
02:36:00 just a fucking like
02:36:02 wild dude
02:36:04 I guess it was a wild stallion
02:36:06 yeah pretty much
02:36:08 like a Japanese stallion I don't know
02:36:10 if they have horses in Japan
02:36:12 he he taught
02:36:14 right he taught all the other
02:36:16 crew members to read the pona
02:36:18 glyphs right that's what happened
02:36:20 or did it only
02:36:22 or did only he know how
02:36:24 I
02:36:26 yes he knew how to read them
02:36:28 because he was from one oh and that's where
02:36:30 they know how to do that
02:36:32 hmm
02:36:34 I'm trying to think that was
02:36:36 that was it I'm trying to think what else can I say
02:36:38 about other than Odin
02:36:40 was cool and I liked his backstory and I liked
02:36:42 seeing
02:36:44 you know him his like
02:36:46 travels with white beard and Roger
02:36:48 and stuff I don't know
02:36:50 uh those those guys are
02:36:52 those guys are sick
02:36:54 yeah I
02:36:56 loved it okay that's my answer
02:36:58 uh next one is
02:37:00 son of Marowak
02:37:02 did the okay here we go
02:37:04 okay three two one go
02:37:06 hey
02:37:08 Ben saying give a take
02:37:10 I'm a huge prover of going to the movies
02:37:12 if you two
02:37:14 are willing to go to see
02:37:16 Sonic 2 in theaters
02:37:18 I will pay for your tickets and snacks
02:37:20 God
02:37:22 huge promise let me know if you were
02:37:24 absolutely serious and I will
02:37:26 legit pay for your tickets
02:37:28 preferably in an AMC theater
02:37:30 give and take I don't know if you have AMCs
02:37:32 in your country
02:37:34 but
02:37:36 if I can pay for your ticket I will pay for yours
02:37:38 no problem
02:37:40 it's just a movie you don't need to
02:37:42 I don't want to go and see it
02:37:44 I don't I also don't want to go and see it
02:37:46 I you'd be paying
02:37:48 for me to waste my time
02:37:50 and I don't even want that
02:37:52 I want to go and see it
02:37:54 I want to
02:37:56 here's my reasoning
02:37:58 here's my reasoning alright
02:38:00 Sonic 1 just has Sonic
02:38:02 and Eggman is an even really Eggman
02:38:04 Sonic 2 we got
02:38:06 Knuckles we got Tails
02:38:08 and Eggman is very egg
02:38:10 like
02:38:12 if this movie does well
02:38:14 I'm just saying
02:38:16 if there was a Sonic free maybe Shadow
02:38:18 and I think the internet needs that
02:38:20 I'd like to see Shadow
02:38:22 I'd like to see if they use guns with Shadow
02:38:24 if Shadow has a gun
02:38:26 then I'll watch anything
02:38:28 that has that in it
02:38:30 they won't put a gun
02:38:32 they won't put a gun in the hands of a hedgehog
02:38:34 on the big screen
02:38:36 but I still wouldn't go and watch the movie
02:38:38 it would be really fucking funny
02:38:40 if Shadow of a Hedgehog
02:38:42 was in a real movie
02:38:44 and I think the best way to
02:38:46 make that happen is to pay for this one
02:38:48 buy a ticket and don't see it
02:38:50 you know first voice mail it
02:38:52 you should just buy their tickets and then they can just sit at home
02:38:54 and not leave the house
02:38:56 yeah hey now we're talking
02:38:58 why don't you do that
02:39:00 now I can get behind this plan
02:39:04 alright next one is called
02:39:06 while you were on Keto
02:39:08 I studied the blade
02:39:10 already
02:39:12 from Gibbon Rise Up
02:39:14 at KilbenSaint.com
02:39:16 that's a good one
02:39:18 alright 3, 2, 1, go
02:39:30 hey mate look at that the baby is doing
02:39:32 a little trick with the rattle I gave him
02:39:40 son of Beno Sento
02:39:42 son
02:39:44 I
02:39:46 train my body
02:39:48 to defeat you
02:39:50 for stealing
02:39:52 school
02:39:54 your defeat
02:39:56 will be delicious
02:39:58 as my
02:40:00 baby formula is
02:40:06 until next time
02:40:08 men go
02:40:10 kitten
02:40:16 are you trying to say
02:40:18 men go go take
02:40:20 yeah they're doing the kendo thing
02:40:22 the phantom horn does
02:40:24 is that an impression
02:40:26 the voice sounded different
02:40:28 I think it's
02:40:30 I think it's some
02:40:32 different person who has adopted
02:40:34 it's a new generation
02:40:36 he was reincarnated
02:40:38 as
02:40:40 Ethan Ralph and
02:40:42 Amanda Lynn Morris
02:40:44 child
02:40:46 was that a thing
02:40:48 I must have missed that
02:40:50 was what a thing
02:40:52 reincarnation of Samurai
02:40:54 Samurai
02:40:56 maybe that was last week
02:40:58 Ethan Ralph and Mae's baby
02:41:00 is
02:41:02 Samurai Samurai reincarnated his soul
02:41:04 into that
02:41:06 child
02:41:08 so that's why they sound different
02:41:10 yeah that's why he sounds different
02:41:12 not because like some guy decided to
02:41:14 just like steal the character
02:41:16 it's
02:41:18 cause he's a baby now
02:41:20 no it's canon
02:41:22 would you kill a baby hmm
02:41:24 I'm thinking about it
02:41:26 if he gave me
02:41:28 enough lip about stealing scrolls
02:41:30 I might think about it
02:41:32 Anna Maury would kill that baby
02:41:34 oh yeah for sure
02:41:36 cause that's what gets the job done
02:41:38 yeah
02:41:40 next one is called

02:42:48 damn okay
02:42:50 okay rosanne you know
02:42:52 warning received you know I was
02:42:54 wondering

02:42:58 that guy it's possible
02:43:00 now we know
02:43:02 he has
02:43:04 only expanded his range
02:43:06 proud of him
02:43:08 next one is called
02:43:10 Shrek's taint
02:43:12 ed
02:43:14 okay
02:43:16 3 2 1 go
02:43:18 so I'm watching
02:43:20 shark retold with some friends
02:43:22 and it was pretty good times all around
02:43:24 there were the bits where
02:43:26 the animators were clearly
02:43:28 being weird for the sake of
02:43:30 being weird and those parts
02:43:32 were kind of shit
02:43:34 otherwise you know pretty fun
02:43:36 time all around
02:43:38 except there was one part where
02:43:40 Shrek has now become irreparably
02:43:42 damaged
02:43:44 and now it's a little bit where there's
02:43:46 Christine Chandler
02:43:48 doing her thing
02:43:50 I was like oh no
02:43:52 for all this you know
02:43:54 considering everything that's happened
02:43:56 but
02:43:58 I can't watch Shrek anymore
02:44:00 it's just ruined
02:44:02 sounds like a you problem
02:44:04 can't enjoy Shrek anymore
02:44:06 damn
02:44:08 that's so tragic
02:44:10 animators
02:44:12 experimenting with weird styles is good
02:44:14 actually
02:44:16 controversial opinion
02:44:18 I thought they were going to say that stuff was good
02:44:20 they said it was bad that shocked me
02:44:22 I mean
02:44:24 for fuck's sake I'm just trying to watch
02:44:26 Shrek you know
02:44:28 I didn't boot up this
02:44:30 version of Shrek that was drawn by
02:44:32 a bunch of different anim-
02:44:34 I didn't do this to see any weird animation
02:44:36 I just want to enjoy the story
02:44:38 of an ogre getting his swamp back
02:44:40 I just want
02:44:42 the straightforward take
02:44:44 I don't know why I didn't just watch
02:44:46 the original Dreamworks production
02:44:48 but I don't want to be distracted
02:44:50 I saw the part by Ratboy Genius
02:44:52 and didn't even realize
02:44:54 how avant-garde
02:44:56 it truly is
02:44:58 I didn't know he was in that
02:45:00 I don't think
02:45:02 Ratboy Genius did a scene for Shrek Retold
02:45:04 yeah I remember that
02:45:06 it was in 3D
02:45:08 and they were weird fucking animation style
02:45:10 was it the dooluck
02:45:12 going into the castle a bit
02:45:14 I remembered Donkey
02:45:16 I thought it was in the forest
02:45:18 oh wait no
02:45:20 oh maybe they did a few scenes
02:45:22 oh god
02:45:24 yeah you might be right
02:45:26 it's been a while since I've seen this
02:45:28 but I just found someone to upload the clip by himself
02:45:34 what kind of a mind makes this
02:45:36 Ratboy Genius is
02:45:38 a
02:45:40 Hollywood composer
02:45:42 who worked on actual movies
02:45:44 and was a pianist
02:45:46 I think in Gattaca
02:45:48 he physically played a pianist
02:45:50 and he writes music professionally
02:45:52 and is very good at writing music
02:45:56 he has a
02:45:58 storied career and at some point
02:46:00 he just decided
02:46:02 I'm gonna make really just fucking
02:46:04 weird as fuck 3D animations
02:46:06 as a vehicle
02:46:08 for the music and the music is well written
02:46:10 it's just that the animations
02:46:12 accompanying them are fucking
02:46:14 strange as hell
02:46:16 my old roommates
02:46:18 were big Ratboy Genius fans
02:46:20 or some of them were
02:46:22 so I've seen some of it
02:46:24 and I've heard a lot of the
02:46:26 songs which are
02:46:28 I wouldn't call them
02:46:30 catchy but they're
02:46:32 memorable
02:46:34 the voices are the
02:46:36 weirdest part about them
02:46:38 but instrumentally there's some interesting things
02:46:40 going on than a few of what I've heard
02:46:42 even just like the background music
02:46:44 during dialogue scenes
02:46:46 sometimes I'm like oh damn this is interesting
02:46:48 I didn't know
02:46:50 that he was a
02:46:52 movie composer that's really funny
02:46:54 yeah I think
02:46:56 I found it out from
02:46:58 the interviews he did
02:47:00 in his channel
02:47:04 I think it was like there was free of him
02:47:06 this was one of them
02:47:08 I think yeah Ryan Doran is the guy
02:47:10 who
02:47:12 he's got a PhD
02:47:14 forgot about that
02:47:16 well good for him
02:47:18 and like music stuff yeah
02:47:20 how do you get a PhD in music
02:47:22 you do a very good job
02:47:24 I'm assuming you write your thesis on
02:47:26 duh I made
02:47:28 a song that sounds really good this time
02:47:30 dude my name
02:47:32 I am doctor music
02:47:34 these two notes
02:47:36 sound nice together
02:47:38 dude
02:47:40 I read a paper about it
02:47:42 is your PhD thesis
02:47:44 just like a symphony you just write a symphony
02:47:46 how does it work
02:47:48 no it can't be it's gotta be
02:47:50 some theory shit but how much more
02:47:52 how much more music theory is there
02:47:54 even to do
02:47:56 we know all the notes there's eight of them
02:48:00 that's it
02:48:02 we figured it out
02:48:04 there's dope
02:48:06 music or art
02:48:10 never heard of them
02:48:12 I don't believe
02:48:14 all these damn
02:48:16 progressive
02:48:18 freaks in congress
02:48:20 all these damn groomers
02:48:22 trying to complicate things
02:48:24 they don't even know what a note is
02:48:26 notes are a spectrum
02:48:28 sounds is a spectrum actually
02:48:30 I'm not part of the note binary
02:48:32 basic
02:48:34 basic music theory
02:48:36 it's either a doe, a ray, a me, a fa, a so, a la
02:48:38 or to your ado nothing in between
02:48:40 how many notes are there
02:48:42 liberals can't even answer
02:48:44 you get it
02:48:46 do you get my joke
02:48:48 yes I get your joke
02:48:50 yes
02:48:52 sacred music
02:48:54 apparently this is a strange article
02:48:56 a related doctor
02:48:58 sacred music
02:49:00 what's sacred about it
02:49:02 it's got to be like church music
02:49:04 hymns and stuff
02:49:06 I don't know what's there to study
02:49:08 oh my god
02:49:12 okay it's a doctor of sacred music
02:49:14 or the
02:49:16 sacred music doctor
02:49:18 I say in fake latin
02:49:20 how sacred blues
02:49:22 sacred music doctor
02:49:26 wait is this
02:49:28 is Ryan Doran
02:49:30 the rat boy
02:49:32 man?
02:49:34 Ryan Doran is the creator of rat boy genius
02:49:36 hmm
02:49:38 okay well you know what
02:49:40 I'm proud of him
02:49:42 I mean I found his IMDb
02:49:44 oh yeah
02:49:46 what's he in
02:49:48 he was in Gattaca
02:49:50 Trekry told us on IMDb
02:49:52 that's interesting
02:49:54 he's been doing stuff since the 80s
02:49:56 yeah he's been around a while
02:49:58 wait but he's
02:50:00 he was born in
02:50:02 79
02:50:04 so
02:50:06 doing stuff in movies when he was 11
02:50:08 oh the thing let's see kid songs
02:50:10 what I want to be
02:50:12 1987 so if he was born in 79
02:50:14 he would have been like 8 years old
02:50:16 maybe he was just like a child actor in that
02:50:18 yeah kid songs he played himself
02:50:20 that's funny
02:50:22 kid songs
02:50:24 yeah the bottom
02:50:26 yeah okay
02:50:28 he was uncredited
02:50:30 he played english kid
02:50:32 uncredited
02:50:34 and meanwhile
02:50:36 the star Ryan
02:50:38 bullman
02:50:40 how dare he have the same first name
02:50:42 bullman is not a real star
02:50:44 doran is a star
02:50:46 yeah he was just in a bunch of
02:50:48 like little kid
02:50:50 we can't credit two ryan's
02:50:52 that would be like that would confuse
02:50:54 him
02:50:56 looks like his
02:50:58 his real stuff was started
02:51:00 in like 2007
02:51:02 rap boys kingdom
02:51:06 when was gattica
02:51:08 oh gattica was 1997
02:51:10 yeah he would have been
02:51:12 20
02:51:14 yeah okay sure
02:51:16 hmm
02:51:18 fast I should get rap boy genius
02:51:20 on the draw cast
02:51:22 yeah you should
02:51:24 uh when we do the free
02:51:26 episode
02:51:28 uh
02:51:30 that would rule
02:51:32 uh
02:51:34 I kind of thought he was
02:51:36 just some weirdo
02:51:38 I mean I guess he
02:51:40 already could also still be
02:51:42 some weirdo yeah that's true
02:51:44 yeah true
02:51:46 he can't get me being weird
02:51:48 I wish I could
02:51:50 I wish I could keep keep
02:51:52 uh anyway
02:51:54 let me let me get uh
02:51:56 uh
02:51:58 how many more voices there's we're most
02:52:00 of the way through uh shit where's the
02:52:02 where's the oh god
02:52:04 where's the tab
02:52:06 I lost track of the tab here we go
02:52:08 um
02:52:10 that one was
02:52:14 uh
02:52:16 that was yeah that was Shrek's
02:52:18 right um okay
02:52:20 the next one is guest what do you
02:52:22 think of Ben saint
02:52:24 that's just a question
02:52:26 oblivion fall
02:52:28 um
02:52:30 what do I think of Ben saint
02:52:32 that's what they want it would be so embarrassing
02:52:34 if I didn't pop on this episode you just have to
02:52:36 talk to a ghost right now but uh I would
02:52:38 when I first started listening to the podcast
02:52:40 I got Ben and Nate confused
02:52:42 um that's really funny
02:52:44 I thought I thought they were
02:52:46 it's funny I thought they were the same person
02:52:48 much like I thought uh mumpkey jones and
02:52:50 munchie were the same person for a couple
02:52:52 weeks at one point hilarious um
02:52:54 I thought that Ben
02:52:56 did the kingdom hearts lecture
02:52:58 and was not due lecture they were done by the same
02:53:00 person that's what I fought in 2017
02:53:02 for like a little while and then I
02:53:04 learned I was mistaken
02:53:06 some people have said we sound kind of
02:53:08 similar I don't hear it at all
02:53:10 but I mean I mean I don't I don't hear it
02:53:12 at all now but at the time
02:53:14 when I was first getting into it because not all the
02:53:16 episodes your icons weren't really
02:53:18 lighting up yeah
02:53:20 so there's a lot
02:53:22 is like like people
02:53:24 say their names at the beginning or whatever but
02:53:26 like you know if I'm just looking over
02:53:28 at my second monitor I don't necessarily see who
02:53:30 was talking so I'd get them confused
02:53:32 um
02:53:34 I don't know that's that's what I think of Ben
02:53:36 saint um I hope that's informative
02:53:38 similar to Nate saint similar to
02:53:40 Nate yeah
02:53:42 it's my it's my most
02:53:44 distinctive feature
02:53:46 uh next one is called
02:53:48 is Davoo's channel dead
02:53:50 and there's no voicemail it's just a
02:53:52 question
02:53:54 Davoo posted like two videos
02:53:56 in like this year I think
02:53:58 yeah it's more active than it's
02:54:00 been in a long time she's posting
02:54:02 I don't actually know what she's doing
02:54:04 she she um I need to watch her new videos
02:54:06 she made a discord
02:54:08 channel or she made a discord
02:54:10 server
02:54:12 moderated it with like weirdly
02:54:14 draconian rules where like
02:54:16 you were only allowed to post like once per
02:54:18 hour
02:54:20 and then left it kept it for like
02:54:22 two months and then decided like hey
02:54:24 I changed my mind I don't want a discord server
02:54:26 I'm deleting it so that's
02:54:28 gone but the channel
02:54:30 is I mean it
02:54:32 you know
02:54:34 I think your last video was like a month ago or something
02:54:36 so it's not dead
02:54:38 yeah it's more active I don't know
02:54:40 maybe maybe it's dead again
02:54:42 who knows
02:54:44 uh next one
02:54:46 is called
02:54:48 shoot shit that samurai
02:54:50 son voicemail was funny

02:54:58 from
02:55:00 cjthexisreal

02:55:58 does he bleach his hair like that

02:56:28 already didn't play all your voicemails
02:56:30 so if you're wondering why you didn't hear them
02:56:32 because you will never hear them again
02:56:34 fuck you
02:56:36 next one is called happy birthday Ben
02:56:38 thanks
02:56:40 next one is called
02:56:42 oh god why am I talking about
02:56:44 her too now
02:56:46 prince isolation at cause ben said
02:56:48 Trixie should pack it in
02:56:50 .com
02:56:52 okay
02:56:54 fine
02:56:56 these are like zero second
02:56:58 this one is not but all the other ones were
02:57:00 yeah alright
02:57:02 3 2 1 go
02:57:04 hey ben
02:57:06 and hopefully gib and any possible
02:57:08 guest I was just watching
02:57:10 the newest episode of the pcp
02:57:12 and first of all the moment
02:57:14 where Ben just starts saying
02:57:16 about Trixie
02:57:18 he just stops talking about Trixie
02:57:20 and starts saying she's so stupid
02:57:22 she's so stupid
02:57:24 is probably the hardest
02:57:26 that I've laughed at
02:57:28 a podcast or a podcast
02:57:30 why are you laughing it's true
02:57:32 that was hilarious
02:57:34 but it also brought me to a little bit of a question
02:57:36 that just popped into my head
02:57:38 Ben do you genuinely
02:57:40 think that
02:57:42 for Trixie to like quit youtube
02:57:44 and whatever she's doing
02:57:46 and like get a retail job
02:57:48 do you think that that's genuinely
02:57:50 smarter for her to do right now
02:57:52 than to just milk whatever she has left
02:57:54 as long as she can
02:57:56 or do you mean that more in the sense of
02:57:58 if she has any more aspirations
02:58:00 of growing she's just wrong
02:58:02 yeah that's all
02:58:04 bye bye
02:58:06 in terms of dollars and cents
02:58:08 yes I think that at this point
02:58:10 her audience is never coming back
02:58:12 and it would be more
02:58:14 the time spent making
02:58:16 videos now
02:58:18 which get like 4000 views
02:58:20 a piece
02:58:22 more profitably spent
02:58:24 bagging groceries
02:58:26 I think that's just true
02:58:28 that's what I think
02:58:30 okay
02:58:32 thanks for your question
02:58:38 next one is called
02:58:42 it's an image
02:58:44 from Gibb you'll witness Ben's
02:58:46 demise at my baby hands

03:02:46 I would love to talk to this guy
03:02:48 okay the other genre of posts he makes
03:02:50 is like
03:02:52 it's like a big block of every
03:02:54 female character in the simpsons
03:02:56 looking at some sort of
03:02:58 like
03:03:00 prehistoric
03:03:02 prehistoric insect
03:03:04 simpsons females
03:03:06 stared in amazement at
03:03:08 Arthroplura a giant prehistoric millipede
03:03:10 as well as the largest land invertebrates of all
03:03:12 Arthroplura live to the
03:03:14 carboniferous to the Permian period
03:03:16 they're big as a car and Arthroplura
03:03:18 are herbivores
03:03:20 that image that compilation image
03:03:22 and they're all looking to the right
03:03:24 side of the screen
03:03:26 it's just like I saw this one too
03:03:28 this is a fucking
03:03:30 genre
03:03:32 stared in amazement at sando aqua monster
03:03:34 the largest carnivorous aquatic mammal
03:03:36 that lived in the oceans of Naboo
03:03:42 you're in crash nitro cart racing
03:03:44 with Nash
03:03:46 he likes the simpsons
03:03:48 he likes ninjas
03:03:50 he likes prehistoric
03:03:52 megafauna
03:03:54 oh my god
03:03:56 you're in crash team racing
03:03:58 and it's just a little
03:04:00 a little pasted image
03:04:02 wait wait
03:04:04 are you fucking serious
03:04:06 I'm looking at a different one
03:04:08 I'm looking at a different one of those
03:04:10 wow
03:04:12 it's a different Eeyore
03:04:14 so nice he did it twice
03:04:16 it's a different crash game
03:04:18 Ruth Powers Laura Powers
03:04:20 Allison Taylor two women from Homer
03:04:22 and behind the laughter babysitter
03:04:24 and their friend Eeyore
03:04:26 remembered Uncle Ben's word
03:04:28 they've done multiple of these
03:04:30 with great power
03:04:32 comes great responsibility
03:04:34 I feel
03:04:36 they look so troubled
03:04:38 wait wait the arms
03:04:40 they're holding the photograph
03:04:42 together oh yeah they are
03:04:44 they have two right hands
03:04:46 I feel
03:04:48 I want to believe
03:04:50 I feel like this is
03:04:52 too so comical
03:04:54 it has to be fake
03:04:56 but who has this much time
03:04:58 he's devoted
03:05:00 a lot of time
03:05:02 to whatever this is
03:05:04 it's the same sort of feeling
03:05:06 you would get looking at some other
03:05:08 like profoundly
03:05:10 autistic person
03:05:12 what was the guy who dressed up as Gumby
03:05:14 and did Thomas the Tank Engine
03:05:16 are we talking about the new storyteller
03:05:18 like yeah
03:05:20 I never watched his stuff but
03:05:22 that's the impression
03:05:24 it's just hyper fixated on this
03:05:26 hyper fixated thing
03:05:28 I think it's cool
03:05:30 I think it's like genuinely cool
03:05:32 I think it's pretty funny
03:05:34 like the
03:05:36 you know what you like
03:05:38 and you just do it
03:05:40 yeah
03:05:42 it's funny
03:05:44 it's really funny that
03:05:46 he gets genuine satisfaction
03:05:48 from like
03:05:50 he'll just film
03:05:52 Nelson going ha ha
03:05:54 at Scar from the Lion King
03:05:56 and he'll just be like
03:05:58 yeah
03:06:00 this is great
03:06:02 wait wait
03:06:04 oh my god that image yeah
03:06:06 it's just Lisa playing every video game
03:06:08 I found one of the videos he mentioned
03:06:10 I didn't realize they were recording their screen of a camera
03:06:12 so they're basically
03:06:14 a primitive form of video editing
03:06:16 where if I have videos open
03:06:18 in multiple tabs they'll play a section
03:06:20 then quickly switch tab play another section
03:06:22 and it says if the two videos are interacting
03:06:24 or talking to each other
03:06:26 it reminds me of when I used to like
03:06:28 edit Let's Plays by putting
03:06:30 a video tape into my
03:06:32 VHS player and hitting record
03:06:34 during different parts
03:06:36 of a video game
03:06:38 to record like my PlayStation 1 footage
03:06:40 and like edit like scenes together
03:06:42 for like a YouTube poop slash Let's Play thing
03:06:44 back in like 2005
03:06:48 this is just the advanced version
03:06:52 I'm watching the Spongebob one
03:06:54 yeah
03:06:56 yeah he's just
03:06:58 yeah he's recording
03:07:00 his screen
03:07:02 are you switching back and forth
03:07:04 just getting Sony Vegas
03:07:06 just put the clips together in Sony Vegas
03:07:08 movie maker even
03:07:10 I mean this just makes more sense
03:07:12 your likes the Simpsons
03:07:14 your likes the Simpsons
03:07:16 he does look at that smile
03:07:18 smile
03:07:20 this is
03:07:22 I love this one
03:07:24 the Simpsons females react to Will Smith
03:07:26 the voice of Oscar from Sharktail
03:07:28 his greatest role
03:07:30 slaps at Chris Rock the voice of Marty
03:07:32 from Madagascar at the Oscars
03:07:34 dude
03:07:36 the DreamWorks canon
03:07:38 it's real
03:07:40 is this the same
03:07:42 women
03:07:44 image compilation I think it is
03:07:46 it's the same like stock
03:07:48 every female background character
03:07:50 they spent the time
03:07:52 to get all of the images together
03:07:54 and they made their image and then they can be like
03:07:56 ah perfect now
03:07:58 whenever I need to use the image I have it already
03:08:00 now whenever I want to see every female
03:08:02 character in the Simpsons react
03:08:04 to something in a sort of
03:08:06 dismayed manner
03:08:08 well I've done
03:08:10 most of the work already
03:08:12 it's so efficient
03:08:14 yeah he's a well oiled machine
03:08:18 anyway I just
03:08:20 why did I bring this guy up
03:08:22 was Ninjas oh it's cause that samurai
03:08:24 baby looks like one of these ninjas
03:08:26 oh the samurai baby
03:08:28 yeah
03:08:30 that's all I had to say about that
03:08:32 he's Ben Hughes
03:08:34 would be a big fan
03:08:36 maybe I should
03:08:38 tweet it at him and see what he thinks
03:08:40 well it's not from the Simpsons so I don't know
03:08:42 no but he's a blue ninja
03:08:44 surely that must
03:08:46 surely that must count for something
03:08:48 maybe it's the Simpsons thing
03:08:50 I haven't seen them
03:08:52 put any different like non Simpsons
03:08:54 females into a blue
03:08:56 ninja costume
03:08:58 so maybe it's just Simpsons females
03:09:00 yeah
03:09:02 possibly it's sure he only seems to
03:09:04 he only seems interested
03:09:06 if it's the Simpsons
03:09:08 alright
03:09:10 well that's
03:09:12 huh
03:09:14 just one more
03:09:16 okay
03:09:18 Ben
03:09:20 they asked you to draw it
03:09:22 right
03:09:24 he asked me if I draw the Simpsons
03:09:28 you could have just drawn it like that
03:09:30 but they'd be happy
03:09:32 yeah
03:09:34 I guess that
03:09:36 that's enough to do it for him
03:09:38 that's enough
03:09:40 you know what
03:09:42 I think I could do this
03:09:44 no I think I could
03:09:46 I can't I have to
03:09:48 I can't let it tear me away from my
03:09:50 holy duty of finishing the Tales Get Strolled
03:09:52 page
03:09:54 is there like an episode that has
03:09:56 like I don't know
03:09:58 Lisa and Marge like sneaking around
03:10:00 doing something
03:10:02 in ninja outfits
03:10:04 hmm
03:10:06 is there a scene that has like
03:10:08 sparked this in this game
03:10:10 like was there a scene where
03:10:12 someone wore this outfit
03:10:14 possibly
03:10:16 I feel like definitely
03:10:18 Barth has worn like
03:10:20 a ninja costume
03:10:22 to sneak around
03:10:24 I think in the episode where he like
03:10:26 soars the head off of Jebediah Springfield
03:10:28 statue
03:10:30 yeah
03:10:32 although that was a black ninja costume
03:10:34 yeah it was different
03:10:36 I just googled it
03:10:38 yeah he wore a black
03:10:40 wait a minute
03:10:42 Simpsons
03:10:44 okay wait I found something
03:10:46 uh
03:10:48 okay no this is him
03:10:50 it was under an official the Simpsons
03:10:52 twitter account tweet
03:10:54 with some Simpsons characters
03:10:56 in blue ninja outfits
03:10:58 by the way
03:11:00 the Simpsons I have these images
03:11:02 and I hope in season 32
03:11:04 or season 33
03:11:06 uh
03:11:08 some episode where Marge, Lisa, Maggie
03:11:10 and other female Springfielders
03:11:12 characters become ninjas
03:11:14 and then oh my god
03:11:16 someone replies to him
03:11:18 shut up
03:11:20 and he says to that person
03:11:22 watch your language
03:11:24 oh wait okay we've got a whole thread here
03:11:26 oh my god
03:11:28 we've got a whole thread this is actually
03:11:30 I gotta
03:11:32 this actually just keeps going
03:11:34 someone asks him like what's with the ninjas
03:11:36 and he says
03:11:38 for someone to do
03:11:40 honestly though what is with the fucking ninjas
03:11:42 and he says for someone to do drawing
03:11:44 request of the Simpsons female characters
03:11:46 in ninja outfits
03:11:48 dress in blue their face covered by mask
03:11:50 belt swords bow staffs
03:11:52 nunchucks and their ninja skills for me
03:11:54 for what reason
03:11:56 because Bart Simpson is the only character
03:11:58 who wear a ninja suit so let these female
03:12:00 characters wear a ninja suit
03:12:02 based
03:12:04 equality but what if they don't need
03:12:06 to then Hughes replies
03:12:08 very well I don't have
03:12:10 to argue he then replies to himself
03:12:12 alright
03:12:14 uh what the
03:12:16 someone else replied
03:12:18 to
03:12:20 he doesn't reply to himself the guy says
03:12:22 it's just mad and then he says alright
03:12:24 oh yeah I didn't see that one but you're
03:12:26 Ryan

03:13:34 hahaha
03:13:36 I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna DM
03:13:38 I'm gonna DM them
03:13:40 The Simpsons Female Stared in Amazement
03:13:42 that looked like Bob Odenkirk
03:13:44 hahaha
03:13:46 oh what their DMs are close
03:13:48 I wanted to send this to them and really
03:13:50 I mean I'm sure they would get
03:13:52 a lot of hate
03:13:54 6000 followers dude they got some fans
03:13:58 hey
03:14:00 have you seen something on Twitter
03:14:02 called
03:14:04 Tinder Skitty
03:14:06 I've
03:14:08 I've seen glimpses
03:14:10 and glances I haven't actually read
03:14:12 any of the comics because it's like
03:14:14 yeah it's nice I'm sure it's
03:14:16 like a lovey-dovey couple
03:14:18 and one of them is a fucking whale lord
03:14:20 and the other one is a skitty
03:14:22 and everybody knows that
03:14:24 his dick is so big that
03:14:26 she would be fucking destroyed
03:14:28 but it's a wholesome comic so
03:14:30 there's no sex haha
03:14:32 and I'm not
03:14:34 it's not too interesting
03:14:36 I get annoyed every time I see one
03:14:38 oh god he did another one
03:14:40 really he's got so many fans
03:14:42 really he's keeping up this facade
03:14:44 this charade even
03:14:46 yeah it's I think it's
03:14:48 people like the
03:14:50 the idea of
03:14:52 thinking about how big his dick is
03:14:54 compared to her
03:14:56 but they don't go there
03:14:58 and so it's like fine to
03:15:00 repost to retweet
03:15:02 I don't know if it's
03:15:04 do you think that's it
03:15:06 I think there's an element of that
03:15:08 is it about his dick
03:15:10 he's so big
03:15:12 and she's so small
03:15:14 his whole body is big
03:15:16 it's not just his giant dick
03:15:18 it's not literally all that
03:15:20 because the art's nice
03:15:22 and I'm sure it's cute and wholesome
03:15:24 or whatever
03:15:26 I'm sure there's a few people who are like oh my god
03:15:28 well sure
03:15:30 if there was porn of this
03:15:32 I mean size difference is probably
03:15:34 what some people are into I guess
03:15:36 but like that's not this guy's
03:15:38 that's not this guy's fault
03:15:40 it's fine it's fine and whatever
03:15:42 it's not a fault I just see it
03:15:44 and I just think it's cynical
03:15:46 I've grown my eyes and I think
03:15:48 yeah I think the whole
03:15:50 I don't know
03:15:52 what if I made a pokemon
03:15:54 but I made one a sexy girl
03:15:56 and I made a cute little
03:15:58 cute little romance
03:16:00 I just like
03:16:02 the beginning
03:16:04 there should be a scene where one of them
03:16:06 just gets caught with a master ball
03:16:08 and there's just a human walks off with them
03:16:10 forever
03:16:12 some human
03:16:14 no a human caught my boyfriend
03:16:16 no he's teaching him how to use
03:16:18 self destruct
03:16:20 no
03:16:22 oh no he made
03:16:24 my waylord boyfriend his h.m. slave
03:16:26 no
03:16:28 oh it's kinda hot though
03:16:30 yeah
03:16:32 yes that's definitely should be where it goes
03:16:34 that's you know what at least that'd be
03:16:36 something at least that'd be something
03:16:38 uh yeah I don't know
03:16:40 it annoys me
03:16:42 and I hate it
03:16:44 but not for any reason that I can
03:16:46 articulate
03:16:48 I feel indifferent to it
03:16:50 generally it's just like
03:16:52 I can see why it's big and popular
03:16:54 people like pokemon people like
03:16:56 cute girls
03:16:58 like there's nothing
03:17:00 of value here for me I don't
03:17:02 see why
03:17:04 I have to keep seeing it
03:17:06 I'm gonna kill him
03:17:08 I'm gonna kill him
03:17:10 I'm gonna find him in real life
03:17:12 and destroy his body and mind
03:17:14 you're gonna bring your pokemon
03:17:16 and you're gonna challenge him
03:17:18 to a pokemon battle and he's gonna have
03:17:20 they're gonna be sent out and you're gonna kill them
03:17:22 like in a nuzlocke

03:18:32 found strange to
03:18:34 hmm
03:18:36 we've been conditioned to think that strange people
03:18:38 have to look strange
03:18:40 no
03:18:42 how wrong of us
03:18:44 absolutely we've all learned a valuable lesson
03:18:46 here today
03:18:48 don't you know the lesson is
03:18:50 don't judge a person's cover
03:18:52 by

03:19:06 hello rowdy freakers
03:19:08 and carp murderers
03:19:10 welcome back to the slime times
03:19:12 weekend update
03:19:14 this time I'm pleased to recount some festive activities
03:19:16 most of the rowdies
03:19:18 love themselves to live in the sewers
03:19:20 and take a break from gameplay
03:19:22 have revived
03:19:24 and resumed their gang violence
03:19:26 in some capacity
03:19:28 rowdy mischief in particular has been
03:19:30 on an outstanding grind set
03:19:32 furthermore as I record this
03:19:34 last night was the anniversary of the
03:19:36 famed rowdy brick night
03:19:38 where rowdies collected thousands of bricks
03:19:40 and used them to assault killer apartments
03:19:42 a special extra art contest
03:19:44 has been started in celebration of our
03:19:46 100 obelisk's fourth birthday
03:19:48 rowdy old hat matt is leading the charge
03:19:50 will apparently be bone hurt
03:19:52 beamed if endless war does not
03:19:54 appreciate the offerings
03:19:56 finally it seems stay that
03:19:58 ghosts have finally gotten their hands on the
03:20:00 technology or the grim magics
03:20:02 to have their own pets accompanying them
03:20:04 mega slime oids
03:20:06 the dark reflections
03:20:08 of the green slime oids of the living
03:20:10 in celebration of this
03:20:12 stay that warbredon invited
03:20:14 all flesh bags to the arena
03:20:16 to fight his new 12 foot
03:20:18 mega slime oid named warforge
03:20:20 both wins and losses
03:20:22 were had for the living
03:20:24 but the real loss was for that guy
03:20:26 you know
03:20:28 that guy who told us not to send in pcp
03:20:30 voicemails and then embarrassed his way into jail
03:20:32 by sending too many
03:20:34 how embarrassing
03:20:36 thank you somebody
03:20:38 uh
03:20:42 i didn't realize mega slime
03:20:44 i kind of thought mega slime oids were already a
03:20:46 ffff
03:20:48 and you could fight them in the wild
03:20:50 maybe that's what i was thinking of
03:20:52 i didn't realize you could not have them
03:20:54 before but uh it's good
03:20:56 that's a good inclusion that makes me happy

03:22:46 killers and i tried to
03:22:48 uh take out terse worthy
03:22:50 but terse worthy got his
03:22:52 ass and uh it was
03:22:54 tragic
03:22:56 i remember when uh the
03:22:58 gankers and shamblers were coming around
03:23:00 and there was a new thing
03:23:02 you could do as a shambler
03:23:04 where you're not like dead you're a
03:23:06 zombie and you can shamble
03:23:08 and destroy like the
03:23:10 functionality of certain districts and
03:23:12 buildings so that people couldn't play
03:23:14 the game anymore and that was funny
03:23:16 so i was i was part i was
03:23:18 i was a big shambler i was shambling
03:23:20 everywhere trying to ruin endless war
03:23:22 so nobody could have fun
03:23:24 yeah that uh
03:23:26 was like a problem that like
03:23:28 continued for a long time i would go to
03:23:30 um i would go to the cafes
03:23:32 to try and i wasn't
03:23:34 really playing the game but i was going to the
03:23:36 cafes to uh create uh
03:23:38 zines like in the in-game zines
03:23:40 of uh slime and punishment
03:23:42 and i would always go to the cafe and like
03:23:44 the cafe would be shambled and so like i
03:23:46 couldn't do it it's like some fuck some
03:23:48 idiot like shambled
03:23:50 the cafe and now it's in ruins and i
03:23:52 yeah and i don't know how to fix it
03:23:54 but uh
03:23:56 i think there was a whole
03:23:58 thing with that it was sort of tied into the
03:24:00 bicarbonate reign like dr downpour
03:24:02 was responsible for the shambling
03:24:04 and that was kind of a i think we were talking
03:24:06 about it in the last contest
03:24:08 i think we i think we were doing a
03:24:10 villains contest was the next yeah
03:24:12 we're gonna judge it in like a week or two
03:24:14 and we did the we're gonna do the villains
03:24:16 contest and dr downpour was one it's like everyone
03:24:18 was like whatever happened to dr downpour
03:24:20 he never got like a resolution
03:24:22 story uh but he was a
03:24:24 minor character for a while
03:24:26 uh i guess i guess
03:24:28 that like uh
03:24:30 now that phantom's revenge
03:24:32 has shown the end of of the
03:24:34 reign and everything
03:24:36 the dr downpour i guess that is that
03:24:38 it's probably in some sort of
03:24:40 different dimension what dimension
03:24:42 is the
03:24:44 endless war in that we could play right now
03:24:46 in our discord browser yeah yeah it's in c197
03:24:48 and that's
03:24:50 where phantom's revenge takes
03:24:52 place yeah yeah
03:24:54 so phantom horn comes from a different
03:24:56 dimension into this one yes
03:24:58 yeah phantom horn came from
03:25:00 a beta timeline and moved
03:25:02 in the alpha timeline
03:25:04 the uh nlaka calm
03:25:06 was deslimed and basically destroyed
03:25:08 and so they brought the beta
03:25:10 nlaka calm
03:25:12 which was not deslimed
03:25:14 to the alpha timeline
03:25:16 and just like landed it on
03:25:18 top of the deslime version
03:25:20 and just were like okay
03:25:22 we're good now
03:25:24 uh yeah but it's
03:25:26 it's from a different timeline but it's in
03:25:28 c197 alpha
03:25:30 so like everyone got genocided
03:25:32 and then replaced with a different timeline
03:25:34 yeah all timeline versions just came
03:25:36 and replaced all the all the fucked up ones
03:25:38 which is
03:25:40 just uh i think in my
03:25:42 in my mind there there
03:25:44 was an opportunity and i don't know if
03:25:46 anything will ever be done with it but i feel like there is
03:25:48 an opportunity there for like
03:25:50 the ruins of a deslimed
03:25:52 nlaka calm are like
03:25:54 crushed underneath the city
03:25:56 now that's that's canon
03:25:58 so i mean you
03:26:00 could maybe venture down there and find
03:26:02 some shit
03:26:04 who knows what
03:26:06 i mean um
03:26:08 chris chan sonichu and the like
03:26:10 merged cop killer uwupiti
03:26:12 virginia monster
03:26:14 we're both crushed down there too
03:26:16 so i don't know
03:26:18 maybe some weird shits going on
03:26:20 i don't know i'm just i'm just asking
03:26:22 questions
03:26:24 next voicemail

03:26:56 is a millennial
03:26:58 who loves jk rallying
03:27:00 oh no it's true
03:27:02 she thinks they have ak yearling
03:27:04 in the show don't they
03:27:06 isn't she a fan
03:27:08 yes
03:27:10 sad darryl do
03:27:12 darryl do comes out as like
03:27:14 an anti
03:27:18 they didn't have any sort of trans
03:27:20 allegory in there did they
03:27:22 not that i can remember
03:27:24 a twilight sparkle

03:27:28 that's true
03:27:30 that's true
03:27:32 twilight sparkle yeah she is
03:27:34 i think she kind of is like one of those
03:27:36 you know one of those white ladies that make
03:27:38 tiktoks about how shitty zoomers are
03:27:42 you know what i mean
03:27:44 i yes
03:27:46 engaging in generational
03:27:48 smack talking like a fucking
03:27:50 weirdo and yet there's a whole genre
03:27:52 of person that thinks it's
03:27:54 cool
03:27:56 why would you shit on the youth
03:27:58 weren't you
03:28:00 once a youth the youth
03:28:02 the youth sometimes shit on us
03:28:04 but i mean that doesn't mean that it's a good look
03:28:06 yeah but that's because they haven't done it yet
03:28:08 right it doesn't mean it's it looks
03:28:10 cool to be like no the children
03:28:12 are stupid actually
03:28:14 we grownups are smarter
03:28:16 so die

03:28:26 step in his blue ninja costume
03:28:30 okay i think

03:28:50 saberspark
03:28:52 and now
03:28:54 for today's episode
03:28:56 it's been hard
03:28:58 they don't like empty voicemails
03:29:00 so i started adding them to art
03:29:02 it was too weak
03:29:04 so i became a ninja cyborg pony
03:29:06 but even then so many high concepts
03:29:08 so many funny characters wasted completely
03:29:10 on deaf ears
03:29:12 i don't know if i can make it to the voice grail
03:29:14 your ways you have lost
03:29:16 better when young don't be too smart
03:29:18 or better understand your medium properly
03:29:20 it's yatsu
03:29:22 not like an audio drama do what appeals to you
03:29:24 and don't chase the success
03:29:26 chase your own satisfaction cat being shot
03:29:28 by a minigun was pretty fun
03:29:30 you've been saying to be drunk

03:29:52 pig sounds to be continued
03:29:54 oh no pig sounds
03:29:56 well that's not the ending
03:29:58 i was hoping for
03:30:00 that's bad ending
03:30:02 they'll never recruit me
03:30:04 i'll never reprise my role
03:30:06 oblivion falls in a backslide
03:30:08 in a backslide into his old ways
03:30:10 i'm clean
03:30:14 you better be
03:30:16 you have to avoid images of pigs
03:30:20 i'm in rehab
03:30:22 i think it was major of light
03:30:24 in my discord
03:30:26 he thought that i'd like hated pigs
03:30:28 he thought that it was
03:30:30 like i specifically disliked pigs
03:30:32 i was like no i
03:30:34 didn't like being jump scared by the scary
03:30:36 squealing sounds of an angry
03:30:38 sow

03:30:42 i wonder if i should

03:31:54 i don't know how long
03:31:56 pumpkin alley is
03:31:58 it took me about two hours
03:32:00 but i got really stuck trying to find

03:32:06 if you're like lucky
03:32:08 i'm gonna look for the lizards
03:32:10 i've heard talk of lizards
03:32:12 but i've seen nothing
03:32:14 it'll take a while to find those
03:32:16 playing the game
03:32:18 literally doesn't take very long
03:32:20 but finding everything
03:32:22 takes maybe an hour
03:32:24 an hour and a bit
03:32:26 you could get stuck looking for those lizards
03:32:28 you could get stuck
03:32:30 i still haven't found four
