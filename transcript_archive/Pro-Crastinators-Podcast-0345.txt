00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:04 Son of a bitch.
00:00:06 Son of a bitch.
00:00:08 Son of a bitch.
00:00:10 Son of a bitch.
00:00:14 Gibb, you start the shit.
00:00:16 Oh, no, you interrupted me.
00:00:18 Sorry, sorry.
00:00:20 My intro was so good and you ruined it.
00:00:22 Now it's shattered into little pieces.
00:00:24 I've fallen over.
00:00:26 It's like that image of the Pepe Frog.
00:00:28 When they have the lunch tray and they fell over and they're crying.
00:00:32 They're crying and everyone around them is laughing about it.
00:00:36 Yeah, it's that other frog.
00:00:38 No, it's the Pepe Frog.
00:00:40 The Pepe Frog.
00:00:42 No, but it's not Pepe.
00:00:44 It's like the little autistic one.
00:00:48 Oh, yeah.
00:00:50 It's like the slightly melty looking one.
00:00:52 I always think of them as the same guy.
00:00:54 It's just drawn funny.
00:00:56 I think he's...
00:00:58 I think he might be named Pipo or something.
00:01:00 Oh, Pipo.
00:01:02 There's the one that Amy Therese always posts.
00:01:04 Welcome to the Procrastinus podcast.
00:01:06 What can I get for you?
00:01:08 I'll have...
00:01:10 I'll have a...
00:01:12 a Pedialyte.
00:01:14 We run out.
00:01:16 What?
00:01:18 We run out of those.
00:01:20 Can I have a glass of seawater?
00:01:22 Just jump in the ocean.
00:01:24 Just jump in the ocean.
00:01:26 Idiot.
00:01:28 No.
00:01:30 I want to pay for it.
00:01:32 Andrew Tate said that I shouldn't just drink water because water is free.
00:01:36 I should drink sparkling water because it costs money.
00:01:38 It's rich man's water.
00:01:40 It's piss man's water.
00:01:42 Same with the ocean.
00:01:44 I need to pay two and a half dollars for it.
00:01:46 I need you to put a slice of lemon in it.
00:01:48 Instead of wading out into the ocean to piss,
00:01:50 he wades out into a swimming pool of sparkling water.
00:01:52 I need to go to a restaurant to piss.
00:01:54 I need to piss in my seawater
00:01:56 from an establishment.
00:01:58 I needed electrolytes.
00:02:00 I was...
00:02:02 I think I was depleted of electrolytes this morning.
00:02:04 Oh no.
00:02:06 Where did you put them?
00:02:08 You know, that's a great question.
00:02:10 I've recently learned that apparently people drink Pedialyte
00:02:12 as like a hangover cure.
00:02:14 Even though it's baby food.
00:02:16 It's like baby food.
00:02:18 Are you a hangover?
00:02:20 No, I'm not a hangover.
00:02:22 I just...
00:02:24 I just think I needed some salt.
00:02:26 That's okay.
00:02:28 I ate some Kirkland brand
00:02:30 cauliflower crust supreme
00:02:32 pizza, so I think I'm good now.
00:02:34 Alright.
00:02:36 Yeah. Okay.
00:02:38 Welcome to the Procrastiners podcast.
00:02:40 Welcome to the show. Hey, I finished Medical Soul.
00:02:42 Did you get around to watching any more of it?
00:02:44 No shit.
00:02:46 I have not
00:02:48 got watched any more of it, actually.
00:02:50 I've had a...
00:02:52 I have a lot of things that I
00:02:54 have meaning to
00:02:56 finish that I have not finished yet.
00:02:58 You and everybody.
00:03:00 Yeah.
00:03:02 I could get into those things, but
00:03:04 how is
00:03:06 Better Call Saul?
00:03:08 I like it. It's a very, very good show.
00:03:10 And it was good.
00:03:12 I don't want to spoil anything.
00:03:14 That's good. That's good.
00:03:16 Tell me
00:03:18 what happens, but without spoiling anything.
00:03:20 Well,
00:03:22 let's just say
00:03:24 Saul got a call
00:03:26 and he spoke on the phone.
00:03:28 And he's better.
00:03:30 And he's better now.
00:03:32 Yes. Nice.
00:03:34 I
00:03:36 did not play anymore. I have not made any more progress in Disco Elysium.
00:03:38 Oh, I started that.
00:03:40 I started that today.
00:03:42 Oh, you did. Cool.
00:03:44 How is that for you?
00:03:46 I'm liking it. I like the detective work.
00:03:48 I like the...
00:03:52 I like how when you've got like stats
00:03:54 in various mind
00:03:56 things and body things, they'll come up
00:03:58 in your internal dialogue.
00:04:00 So like...
00:04:02 Somebody says something and then your logic
00:04:04 brain comes in and says, well, what that means
00:04:06 is this. And I'm like, oh,
00:04:08 thanks. I'm dumb. I wouldn't have known.
00:04:10 Yeah.
00:04:12 So I think this has been
00:04:14 much remarked upon,
00:04:16 but it's interesting how
00:04:18 in Disco Elysium, those stats,
00:04:20 they're not just things that you can do.
00:04:24 They're proclivities
00:04:26 of yours. So like if you have a lot of logic,
00:04:28 it's not just that you can
00:04:30 logically deduce things
00:04:32 that you couldn't otherwise.
00:04:34 It's that you will approach
00:04:36 a task with logic, even if another
00:04:38 solution might be better.
00:04:40 So like if you have lots of
00:04:42 stats in logic, you might
00:04:44 use a logical approach to a solution
00:04:46 when like a more emotional one
00:04:48 might have been better. Just because
00:04:50 that's like what you are
00:04:52 geared towards doing.
00:04:54 Yeah, it's interesting. There's a few times
00:04:56 when it's like a part of
00:04:58 my psyche comes forward and says,
00:05:00 how about this? And I'm like,
00:05:02 eh. Yeah.
00:05:04 Nah. And they're like, um,
00:05:06 come on though. Come on.
00:05:08 Electrochemistry is always trying to get me
00:05:10 to do drugs.
00:05:12 Yeah.
00:05:14 And he's got to stop that
00:05:16 because I'm staying clean.
00:05:18 Yeah, I'm playing as
00:05:20 a person would.
00:05:22 Not like a gamer.
00:05:24 Because I've seen that it's
00:05:26 like role playing,
00:05:28 but you're an
00:05:30 amnesiac. You forgot everything.
00:05:32 Yeah.
00:05:34 So I'm as the player learning
00:05:36 this character I'm playing as.
00:05:38 But I'm only doing things
00:05:40 I feel like I would do if I
00:05:42 was also trying to figure out
00:05:44 who I was. Yeah.
00:05:46 It's fun that way.
00:05:48 I'm pretty much doing the same.
00:05:50 I'm picking
00:05:52 the most me
00:05:54 answers to things.
00:05:56 And yeah, generally
00:05:58 that means that I'm apologizing
00:06:00 a lot because I feel bad because
00:06:02 apparently I went on a drug bender
00:06:04 and gave myself brain damage and now
00:06:06 I can't do my job as a policeman
00:06:08 and I'm a huge failure.
00:06:10 It's funny. I've seen all
00:06:12 the sorry options and I haven't been
00:06:14 clicking them mostly because I'm too awkward
00:06:16 to admit that I was I've lost
00:06:18 my memory. Have you are you just trying
00:06:20 to like you just trying to play it cool?
00:06:22 I'm trying to wing it and hoping that nobody
00:06:24 notices. That's good.
00:06:26 The more information I get, I'm like, oh, okay,
00:06:28 I'm on a case and I got this.
00:06:30 I did have to tell my partner
00:06:32 at some point because
00:06:34 I had to radio in say I lost my badge,
00:06:36 but earlier I told him that I had
00:06:38 the badge and he's like, oh,
00:06:40 oh, okay.
00:06:42 And I'm like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied.
00:06:44 Yeah.
00:06:46 I died a couple
00:06:48 time where I lost a couple times and I had to
00:06:50 restart. And I think the first couple
00:06:52 times I told my station that I lost the
00:06:54 badge, but like
00:06:56 I didn't deliberately save scum, but I just
00:06:58 had to do that section again. And so I think
00:07:00 the third time I did it, I told them like,
00:07:02 nah, I'm just going to tell him I didn't lose
00:07:04 the badge and they believed it. So
00:07:06 it actually worked eventually.
00:07:08 Yeah, they made fun of me.
00:07:10 And I was like, yeah, okay.
00:07:12 I need to do,
00:07:14 I need info.
00:07:16 They still made fun of me because they know
00:07:18 I lost my gun, but
00:07:20 they don't know. Oh, I lied about that.
00:07:22 They made fun of me. No, they did.
00:07:24 They know I lost my badge. I lied about losing
00:07:26 my gun. They don't, they don't know I lost my
00:07:28 gun. So it was the same then. Yeah.
00:07:30 Yeah.
00:07:32 I was like, I can't, I can't take
00:07:34 double
00:07:36 laughter. I need to pretend I'm cool.
00:07:38 Mm-hmm.
00:07:40 We'll see how long that lasts.
00:07:42 I died immediately
00:07:44 upon starting the game.
00:07:46 I clicked around on things
00:07:48 and I turned the light on, which gave me
00:07:50 one point of damage and I was like, ah, fuck.
00:07:52 But then I tried to grab
00:07:54 the
00:07:56 the ceiling, the tie on the ceiling fan, and I failed and I died.
00:08:02 I have died twice.
00:08:05 The only time it's happened, but it's funny that, like, before I even knew how the game
00:08:08 worked, I died him immediately.
00:08:11 That's really funny.
00:08:13 Okay, have you met, have you met Measurehead?
00:08:17 No, I'm not too far in.
00:08:21 I've walked around a couple places.
00:08:22 I haven't talked to the rioters or the union people.
00:08:26 I talked to the old lady on the boat.
00:08:28 I talked to the little kids.
00:08:30 You met Kuno and the, and the far, well, I call her the forest girl.
00:08:34 Yeah, I met them.
00:08:36 Um, okay, I've had two losses and they're like, I'm doing a lot better now.
00:08:41 Like I got a bunch of medicine and now I'm like not really in danger of losing anytime
00:08:46 soon.
00:08:47 But like early on, I was very, very frail and I died once.
00:08:52 I won't say anymore.
00:08:54 I'll just say it was a, it wasn't even really a fight.
00:08:57 It was just, I got in like a physical, some in a bit of a physical confrontation and just
00:09:04 like the strain of it made me have a heart attack and die because of my weakened state
00:09:10 and I just died.
00:09:13 And then the other time I lost was, um, it was when the forest girl just started crying
00:09:19 and the rape just started yelling that I was going to rape her and I was just so demoralized
00:09:23 by that, that I lost my morale points and I lost my will to be a cop and I quit the
00:09:26 forest.
00:09:27 Oh, whoa.
00:09:28 Yeah.
00:09:29 I haven't run into a situation where I lose a morale point for some reason.
00:09:35 No, I, yeah, I've had, I've had one physical loss and one morale loss and the morale loss
00:09:41 was a lot funnier.
00:09:43 Yeah, I think.
00:09:45 It was when I asked who's Kuno.
00:09:48 The girl just starts crying, rape, rape.
00:09:50 I'm like, oh God, no.
00:09:52 Yeah, they, they did that for a bit.
00:09:54 I could tell he was trying to get a rise out of me.
00:09:57 He wanted like me to do something and I turned around like, yeah, I don't need, I don't have
00:10:02 time for this.
00:10:03 And he said, ha, ha, you're my bitch.
00:10:05 You'll do, I got you.
00:10:07 Kuno rides the lightning.
00:10:10 He's a little, he's a little, he's a little freak.
00:10:13 He's riding the lightning.
00:10:14 You know what?
00:10:15 Just let him.
00:10:16 Let him cook.
00:10:17 Yeah, let him cook.
00:10:18 Let him cook.
00:10:22 Have you investigated his, his, his like area?
00:10:27 I've looked around.
00:10:28 I found a door and I went in.
00:10:31 Yeah.
00:10:32 It's like a little kid's playhouse.
00:10:33 His little shack.
00:10:34 Yeah.
00:10:35 Kuno's shack.
00:10:36 I tried to investigate the body.
00:10:38 I'm, I went, I threw up the first time.
00:10:42 Yeah.
00:10:43 They said, boy, should get ammonia.
00:10:44 So I went, found, got ammonia, bought it from the store, I came back.
00:10:47 Failed again.
00:10:48 Yep.
00:10:49 Then it was what happened to me.
00:10:50 Then you got to get your shit together.
00:10:52 I got my shit together.
00:10:53 I failed again.
00:10:55 And then.
00:10:56 Even after getting your shit together.
00:10:57 Yeah.
00:10:58 It was like a 50% chance and I failed.
00:11:00 And then it was like, okay, well, I just got to go do something else.
00:11:04 I think if you just, I think if you just wait a while, like I think it gets easier and easier
00:11:09 like as the days pass.
00:11:12 Uh, I think.
00:11:14 I'm still on day one.
00:11:16 So I haven't done that much because I think, I think I, I think I investigated the body
00:11:20 on day two and yeah, I got my shit together and I think I also got an extra modifier
00:11:24 because like time had passed and like the smell had become not as like less bad.
00:11:30 That's odd though.
00:11:31 It's already been there for like a week.
00:11:34 Why would the smell get better?
00:11:36 Yeah.
00:11:37 I mean, it would eventually start to get better.
00:11:39 I don't know if it would.
00:11:40 Maybe you just get used to it a week.
00:11:42 Yeah.
00:11:43 I don't know.
00:11:45 Maybe because it had, it had frozen.
00:11:47 Uh, no.
00:11:51 But if it's getting warmer, it would smell even worse.
00:11:53 Did you investigate the footprints?
00:11:55 I did.
00:11:56 I did all the footprints.
00:11:57 I was so smart.
00:11:58 How is he so good at identifying shoe sizes?
00:12:01 Uh, he's a rain man.
00:12:03 He is.
00:12:04 Do you know?
00:12:05 He's got that, that autistic sight.
00:12:08 Do you know your name?
00:12:11 I know the, I'm a clipboard.
00:12:14 There's initials and I assumed that there's a, some, probably my name.
00:12:19 I don't know what it is though.
00:12:21 Yeah.
00:12:22 All right.
00:12:23 I'm thinking that coat that's hanging up is my coat.
00:12:27 The one on like the railing?
00:12:28 Yeah.
00:12:29 It's my coat and it's probably got my gun on my badge in it because I mean, they'd probably
00:12:33 be in that if I leave them anywhere.
00:12:36 A reasonable assumption.
00:12:39 I tried to jump over the thing, but he got, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he
00:12:43 bitch out.
00:12:44 He bitched out.
00:12:45 Yeah.
00:12:46 I bitched out.
00:12:47 I didn't, I didn't make the jump.
00:12:48 I, well, I won't, I won't, uh, I think, you know, spoilies.
00:12:55 I like to figure stuff out.
00:12:56 I think I got to the coat in an unusual way.
00:12:58 I think I got there in a way that I kind of like wasn't supposed to, but like, I mean,
00:13:04 there is a door, but I just don't know how to get to that door.
00:13:07 So yeah.
00:13:08 For sure.
00:13:09 I'm going to, I think my plan right now is to spend my experience points to level up
00:13:15 my endurance or something so I can try approaching the body again.
00:13:20 There's another, there's a couple other things.
00:13:23 I still haven't got my tie.
00:13:24 I failed to get my tie.
00:13:26 You still haven't gotten like from the fan.
00:13:28 Yeah.
00:13:29 That's funny.
00:13:30 It's just up there.
00:13:31 I have to, I have to spend a point in Savoy fair or whatever.
00:13:36 Yeah.
00:13:37 I have to try again.
00:13:39 My, um, I think they were, okay, I've heard that there's like things to do with the tie,
00:13:46 but like I think my stats are just like wrong and I, and like they're not, none of them
00:13:52 have happened for me.
00:13:54 What are your like stats in, by the way, what's what like class did you choose?
00:13:58 I made my own.
00:13:59 I did.
00:14:00 Uh, good.
00:14:01 I can't remember the top two were good and good.
00:14:06 And then it was weak and weak, but you don't remember what the ones were that you like
00:14:11 focused on.
00:14:12 I think it was an intellect.
00:14:14 Um, and I chose the, the conceptualize as my special skill.
00:14:20 I'm pretty good with empathy.
00:14:22 So whatever one that is in, interesting.
00:14:26 And the ones I'm bad at are like, uh, like acrobatics and fucking endurance or whatever.
00:14:32 Yeah.
00:14:33 I'm a nerd, but I'm a smart nerd.
00:14:35 I, I went, I went with thinker.
00:14:37 So I'm, I'm like maxed out in an encyclopedia.
00:14:42 And I think like logic is pretty good and I'm pretty, I'm pretty bad at everything else.
00:14:48 I like the conceptualize cause it comes off occasionally as like, that's like, yeah, I
00:14:54 like that.
00:14:55 I let encyclopedia is fun just cause it gives you like facts that you wouldn't know otherwise.
00:15:02 Um, what are their, uh, what are their like NPCs?
00:15:06 Have you talked to that have been interesting?
00:15:09 Uh, I talked to the manager of the little place.
00:15:14 The whirling and rags, the whirling and rags.
00:15:17 And yeah, I talked to the manager.
00:15:20 I'm not the bartender.
00:15:23 Yeah.
00:15:24 Uh, there was the thing where he thought he made the lady quit cause he asked for her
00:15:33 number.
00:15:35 And when I talked to her through the radio, yeah, I tried to be, I tried to get the way
00:15:40 I'm playing it as I'm like, if I sense that there might be like, if somebody might clam
00:15:46 up, if I say the wrong thing, I try to be cautious.
00:15:49 So I managed to go get some, sometimes they do.
00:15:51 Sometimes you can say something that will like change a person's attitude.
00:15:56 Yeah.
00:15:56 And so I was, I was pretty cautious with the lady cause she seemed like she didn't like
00:16:02 me and it was, it became clear.
00:16:04 That I was, I was a bad guy.
00:16:06 Yeah.
00:16:08 But I managed to clear things up between her and the guy cause she doesn't hate him.
00:16:13 And I told him that it was a good Samaritan.
00:16:16 Oh, that's funny.
00:16:18 Yeah.
00:16:18 She told me like she, she was like surprised that I thought that it was because of him.
00:16:24 But I didn't get any like options to maybe it's because you have empathy and I don't.
00:16:29 But like, yeah, I didn't, I didn't get the option to tell him that lol.
00:16:35 Sucks to be him.
00:16:39 Yeah, I'm buttering people up.
00:16:41 I'm the butter guy.
00:16:44 Butter guy.
00:16:45 Have you, have you been in the bookstore?
00:16:49 No, I saw that.
00:16:50 I didn't go in.
00:16:51 I spoke, I went past it, spoke to the lady on the boat.
00:16:56 Oh, Joyce, Joyce, the, the, the rich woman, wild, the wild pines lady.
00:17:02 Yes.
00:17:03 Yeah, talked to her about state of the, state of the union.
00:17:06 The ultra liberal.
00:17:10 Yeah.
00:17:11 If you, if she will admit to being an ultra liberal, if you ask the right questions.
00:17:16 I, I did not.
00:17:17 I see.
00:17:18 I, I didn't want to like, because I was still, I don't know, early in investigating.
00:17:24 Yeah.
00:17:25 I didn't really want to make anyone mad at me.
00:17:27 So I'm just sort of like nodding, sagely, quiet and not really saying anything.
00:17:33 That could make them upset.
00:17:35 I still, I still haven't really like, firmly picked sides in anything.
00:17:43 I see the things where it's like, haha, yeah, unions are cool.
00:17:46 I hate the rich, you know, things where you can say that.
00:17:49 And I'm like, yeah, but I shouldn't say that to her, though.
00:17:53 I need her for info.
00:17:55 Yeah.
00:17:56 I don't, I mean, hmm.
00:17:59 I did, I did say some, I did say some pretty communist stuff to her, actually.
00:18:05 I don't know if you want to know what she said.
00:18:07 It's not a huge spoiler or anything, but if you want to.
00:18:10 Well, the ultra liberal thing.
00:18:13 She was, she didn't say that to me.
00:18:15 She's, she's actually, she's cool with it.
00:18:17 She just kind of laughs.
00:18:18 She's kind of like, haha, yeah.
00:18:22 It's like, it's kind of charming.
00:18:24 I think she probably is bad.
00:18:26 Like, I think her company.
00:18:28 Honestly, I'm still, I'm still feeling it out.
00:18:30 I think wild pines is probably bad, but she seems nice.
00:18:36 She, she, uh, did she talk about disco at all?
00:18:40 Uh, no.
00:18:43 She and, uh, the protagonist seem to be of an age and seems like they were both
00:18:50 like around when they were younger, you know, disco was the big thing.
00:18:54 She's just like, yeah.
00:18:56 Hey, I remember, I remember disco.
00:18:59 Yeah.
00:19:00 Communism might have been cool, but they lost.
00:19:03 Oh, well.
00:19:05 Uh, very nice.
00:19:06 I like her.
00:19:09 I assume you have not met the union boss.
00:19:11 No, I saw the people shouting and I'm like, okay, well, I still don't know.
00:19:15 Yeah.
00:19:16 I'm still trying to get in to, uh, to, uh, to inspect the body.
00:19:20 So I just, I didn't want to like open too many threads.
00:19:22 So I left them for a moment.
00:19:24 I need to go back and talk to the, uh, the, the right to work, uh, protest people.
00:19:32 There's like, I know there's like, there's like threads there that I have
00:19:35 not followed up on.
00:19:39 And, uh, I guess the last thing that happened was I found a bag and now I'm
00:19:43 picking up trash.
00:19:44 Oh, I was so stoked when I found the bag.
00:19:49 I, I didn't find it until the second day, which.
00:19:53 Was really frustrating because, uh, I really wanted money on the first day.
00:19:58 I was really hurting for money and I saw all these bottles around.
00:20:02 I was like, I just want to collect the bottles.
00:20:04 I just want money.
00:20:06 And I didn't, and, uh, oh, I just, I just had to live with that.
00:20:14 But it was, I think they should have allowed you to pick up a single
00:20:17 bottle with one hand instead of like, if you don't have a bag, you can't
00:20:20 pick up any.
00:20:22 Honestly, what?
00:20:24 And like, bring it, bring it, bring one bottle at a time to the bottle return.
00:20:28 Like if you're, if, if you're like, this is all you got.
00:20:32 It's the only thing you can do and you really need cash.
00:20:35 Like, I think if you're desperate enough, you would do that.
00:20:38 I think that that would know, you know what?
00:20:40 I think you're totally wrong and it's good that they did what they did.
00:20:43 They should not, they should not allow you to play the game in such a miserable way.
00:20:48 Yeah.
00:20:50 No, like if you take your pants off, you tie the ends of the pants, you got a huge bag.
00:20:57 And you go around picking up trash off naked.
00:21:02 Yeah.
00:21:03 Okay.
00:21:03 The thing is, if, if you know what you're doing, like you would just
00:21:06 know where the bag was and you could just go get it, like immediately.
00:21:10 If you just wanted to collect all that stuff, like I didn't know where it was.
00:21:14 I had to find it, but that's okay.
00:21:17 I was like deliberately like not looking up things in advance.
00:21:26 I have other things I could say about some characters, but you haven't met
00:21:30 several of them yet.
00:21:31 So I won't get into it.
00:21:36 I'm sort of being a communist, but like I said, I haven't really like firmly
00:21:40 committed to it.
00:21:42 I haven't like, yeah.
00:21:44 I feel committed to being a detective.
00:21:47 I like figuring stuff out.
00:21:49 Yeah.
00:21:50 I'm going to, I'm going to find this mystery.
00:21:53 Yeah.
00:21:53 Who did the killings and how did they do the killings?
00:21:57 That's my first.
00:21:57 Do you have, do you have any leads?
00:21:59 Do you have any leads on the, on the, the murder?
00:22:02 Well, I know all the work boots in the, the footprints and stuff as the small set
00:22:09 of footprints could be a lady, could be a child.
00:22:14 And there's the, you know, there's like something, but like nothing that I can
00:22:19 really follow up on.
00:22:21 I'm mostly at the, I'm trying to find my badge and gun.
00:22:25 Okay.
00:22:26 So I took to the, what's her face?
00:22:31 Still don't know who called in the body.
00:22:33 And you mean the woman on the phone?
00:22:36 Yeah.
00:22:37 She didn't call in about the body.
00:22:39 Yeah.
00:22:41 And so I need to go check out the phone that was used because it's like one phone
00:22:46 or two phones.
00:22:48 Oh, where's, where's that?
00:22:53 Well, remember that she talked about like people, she didn't call it in.
00:22:58 Nobody would call in because one, nobody calls the cops because the union runs
00:23:06 the town union already knew.
00:23:09 And people call the people, like people steal the copper from the wires.
00:23:16 So there's a union phone that the union uses that is still got its wires.
00:23:21 And then there's one down near the coast.
00:23:24 That's what she said.
00:23:25 So I'm like, okay, maybe I can go find something there.
00:23:28 Come to think of it.
00:23:30 I don't think I have figured out who called in the body.
00:23:35 And I don't think I have, I remember mention of the phone.
00:23:38 I don't think I've investigated the phone.
00:23:40 So thanks for reminding me about those leads I should follow up on.
00:23:46 It's just like we're two detectives.
00:23:51 But you don't know like whose boots they were.
00:23:54 No, I mean, they're all workers boots aside from maybe one of them.
00:23:59 So they're probably a bunch of people with workers boots on.
00:24:03 And there's only like sea people around here, the union people.
00:24:07 The debaude, the debaude's union.
00:24:12 Yes, yes.
00:24:16 Do you I was going to do you know who the victim was?
00:24:20 No. OK, I think I'm on day like three.
00:24:25 And I think I have a pretty clear idea of what happened with the murder itself.
00:24:33 But there's like a bunch of like other like stray details surrounding it
00:24:38 that I like am aware of, but like don't understand.
00:24:42 And I want to, you know, that that's kind of where I'm at with it.
00:24:48 Oh, I haven't found a place to sleep.
00:24:51 You haven't. It's like two p.m. in my game.
00:24:55 That's the thing I need to figure out before it gets too dark.
00:24:58 Yeah. Yeah, you better.
00:25:02 Oh, or else.
00:25:05 They're going to get you.
00:25:08 The night terrors, the old sleep gremlins.
00:25:13 Do you know?
00:25:14 Do you know what the pale is like a bucket?
00:25:18 No, P.A.L.E. Nope.
00:25:22 You know what?
00:25:22 I also don't know what it is.
00:25:24 I've just heard it mentioned and I don't know what it means.
00:25:29 Did I hear it mentioned?
00:25:32 I feel like, no, maybe I did.
00:25:35 Maybe I can check the logs or like if there's a notes thing I can see.
00:25:41 Hmm. Well, well, that's it, officer.
00:25:46 Good over and out. All right.
00:25:49 Thank you for helping me with my investigation into your time playing that video game.
00:25:58 Pleasure doing business with it.
00:26:00 I did not play any more of it because I've been I played Mega Man battle
00:26:05 network on stream, a much worse game.
00:26:11 It's actually it's all right.
00:26:12 It's honestly a bit of that.
00:26:14 Yeah. Oh, yeah, you popped in.
00:26:16 I saw you. How long was the stream?
00:26:19 I've done two now and the first one was like four hours and the second one was
00:26:22 like five hours and I think I'm about like halfway through the first game.
00:26:27 Which is there's they're long, they're long.
00:26:32 So extrapolate.
00:26:33 Let's see how many games are there?
00:26:36 I think there's like.
00:26:39 Eleven. Eleven.
00:26:41 So like 10 hours, 20 hours.
00:26:47 Twenty hours. It's going to be like 11. Yeah, yeah.
00:26:51 Well, you know what? It's OK.
00:26:53 I'll just it'll just be a project.
00:26:56 It'll just be a project.
00:26:58 I like the combat.
00:27:00 I like the battles. They're pretty fun.
00:27:04 It I just hate I hate the random battles.
00:27:08 I hate that when I'm in a dungeon walking around trying to figure
00:27:11 shit out every so the random battles come and just interrupt what I'm doing.
00:27:15 And those battles are not fun.
00:27:17 They're repetitive.
00:27:18 They're not they're not very taxing.
00:27:21 They're not very interesting.
00:27:23 They're just they're just fucking bullshit you have to deal with.
00:27:27 And it makes up a significant portion of the time spent playing.
00:27:31 It's just getting through random battles.
00:27:33 Do you get like experience points or money?
00:27:38 You get you get money and you get new chips,
00:27:41 which are basically like spells, attacks and stuff.
00:27:44 OK, you basically use like a deck.
00:27:46 You basically build a deck of chips and that's like what you use to do damage.
00:27:51 So you do benefit from doing them.
00:27:55 But I still don't like them and it doesn't make for a good gaming experience.
00:28:02 Now, I mean, generally in a game with random battles,
00:28:06 it depends mostly on if the battles you have to participate in
00:28:13 helping the pacing of the game overall.
00:28:16 Like if you get to a boss and because of the random battles,
00:28:18 you have a good chance at winning.
00:28:21 If the pacing is fine, then you can just move on through and it's OK.
00:28:26 But if it turns out that so much of the random battles
00:28:29 were completely superfluous and you didn't need them, then it sucks.
00:28:33 I've been trying to flee from as many of them as I can.
00:28:38 And it's I think that's the right move.
00:28:43 I still like I can't flee from every battle.
00:28:46 I have to get I have to do enough that like.
00:28:50 I haven't I haven't I haven't hit any difficulty spikes
00:28:53 that I like have not been able to deal with, so it's OK.
00:28:58 I just think.
00:29:00 I just think the game.
00:29:03 Like the game as it exists now, like if you took random battles out,
00:29:06 yeah, you would never get any money and you would never get any chips
00:29:08 and you couldn't beat the bosses and stuff and like I get that.
00:29:11 I think the game would be better if it were just balanced
00:29:14 so that the random battles just weren't there.
00:29:17 You know what I mean?
00:29:19 Yeah, yeah, it would make the game shorter and better.
00:29:25 It would be that difficult to have.
00:29:27 Like I've seen other games, even on the GBA,
00:29:30 we're like you have little sprites of enemies moving around.
00:29:35 And if they see you, they'll run towards you or they're running,
00:29:38 they're moving in a pattern.
00:29:39 And if you can get out of the way of the pattern,
00:29:41 God, I wish the the combat.
00:29:45 That's how Mega Man Legends.
00:29:46 Well, Mega Man Legends is an action game.
00:29:50 Yeah, but I mean, you can you can run by the enemies if you want to.
00:29:54 And if you know how to avoid them, yeah,
00:29:57 that would improve the game a lot.
00:30:00 But I, you know, whatever, I just got to deal with it.
00:30:06 Other than that, it's kind of good.
00:30:10 And it's fun and the battles are pretty fun when they're not just
00:30:14 throwing a bunch of bullshit at me.
00:30:16 So, you know, not not an entirely positive experience,
00:30:21 but it's not a completely negative one.
00:30:24 They say they say the games get better
00:30:27 until like the like five and six.
00:30:29 And I think they say like six is terrible.
00:30:32 I don't know what's terrible about that,
00:30:33 but everybody seems to agree that it's bad.
00:30:35 So I think things might get better before they get worse, Lamal.
00:30:42 I don't know.
00:30:43 Is there anything so far that has been an interesting lore bit
00:30:50 when compared with compared with what you know from Wikipedia?
00:30:54 Is there anything like, oh, interesting?
00:31:00 I mean, the most I mean, that network one pretty much just sets up the premise.
00:31:05 And like the interesting thing about the premise is just what I said
00:31:08 in the lecture that like it's it's kind of what I don't know
00:31:12 if I really went into this in the lecture, actually.
00:31:14 But like the fact that like the world is completely different
00:31:18 pretty much just based on what Dr. Light decided to do.
00:31:22 And that's and that's kind of interesting.
00:31:24 And the the.
00:31:29 There there is a big twist that you only find out at the end of the first game.
00:31:35 And it.
00:31:38 I mean, do you want to know what it is?
00:31:39 I could just say it.
00:31:41 Yeah, I probably wouldn't want to play them.
00:31:44 Well, I mean, you find it at the very end.
00:31:46 OK, I mean, you know that like you're this kid
00:31:49 and you have this little personal computer
00:31:51 and everyone's personal computer has a little program inside it.
00:31:54 And your little program is like what
00:31:58 your little battler goes in and like kills viruses.
00:32:00 And like does it's a light world, dark world sort of thing.
00:32:05 But sort of it's it's sort of like everything interacts with computers
00:32:10 and like the computer is sort of just its own sort of separate reality
00:32:15 that like programs live in.
00:32:17 And your guy is a little Mega Man.
00:32:19 You're your little yeah, your little net navi,
00:32:21 your little interface program is a little Mega Man, Mega Man dot exe.
00:32:26 The the twist is you find out at the very end
00:32:29 that actually Mega Man dot exe is like is your dead brother
00:32:35 who your dad like fucking digitized because he was dying.
00:32:41 Yeah, you used to have a brother,
00:32:43 but he died and your dad turned him into a turned him into Mega Man dot exe
00:32:48 to be your little your little internet slave.
00:32:54 It's so fucked.
00:32:56 More like dot executable because he got he was he died.
00:33:00 He was extremely executable. Yeah.
00:33:05 So, you know, that's that's the
00:33:09 that's like the the the premise.
00:33:12 And I don't know.
00:33:15 I don't know if like that.
00:33:18 I don't know how that impacts later games in the series.
00:33:22 I know in this one, it's pretty much just like a last minute twist revelation.
00:33:25 Oh, my God, you're my brother.
00:33:27 What the fuck have my brother is inside a computer?
00:33:32 Get out of there. Get the heck out of there.
00:33:34 And he says, I can't. I'm stuck in the computer.
00:33:37 And you say, no.
00:33:39 Quick, we got to invent 3D printing.
00:33:42 We got to get him out.
00:33:43 If only if only someone would build like a robot body that like a sentient
00:33:48 that like a sentient AI could like inhabit and it could like walk around.
00:33:51 Yeah. Why couldn't they do that?
00:33:54 If only Dr.
00:33:55 Light had started had studied robotics instead of AI.
00:33:58 Oh, fuck.
00:33:59 Um, Lamal.
00:34:02 Yeah, Dr. Light, you could have been could have been like a
00:34:06 or the Boston Dynamics or he could have got into like chat GBT.
00:34:12 Yeah, it's too dark, dark timelines.
00:34:17 Yeah. He he it's like
00:34:22 looked at in the way that like these are like two versions of the same world.
00:34:26 It's it's kind of interesting to think like,
00:34:30 is a net navi essentially like a cyber elf that just like is inside the network
00:34:36 and like has not developed the technology to like
00:34:39 exit the network yet or or is a net navi more like a robot master?
00:34:46 And that is not truly sentient.
00:34:49 Hmm. Well, if it was a real boy before.
00:34:53 What has become of him?
00:34:54 Yeah, turned into a net navi.
00:34:56 It would be pretty it would be if he's if he's merely been cyberized
00:35:00 like a cyber elf, like that's kind of OK.
00:35:03 But if he's been like reduced in his complexity
00:35:06 to be like a non sentient, a not fully sentient robot master, like that's grim.
00:35:13 That's grim, but if he was going to die, then he would be nothing.
00:35:18 Well, yeah.
00:35:20 Well, sure. Yes.
00:35:22 Maybe it may be a little like odd for the brother to be like,
00:35:26 oh, your family.
00:35:30 Yeah, but you're you're like a machine.
00:35:33 You don't have emotions.
00:35:34 I don't know.
00:35:35 I kind of think part of me wants to say that like
00:35:39 if the option if if if like true true like self determination
00:35:44 and sentience is off the table because the technology is just not there.
00:35:49 And like the choice is like either you die or I turn you into a
00:35:53 not entirely sentient like cyberized like quasi humanoid.
00:35:58 I kind of think maybe you should just let him die
00:36:01 because like the alternative is kind of it's it's ghoulish that the like I'm
00:36:05 imagining like a family member comes back as Clippy, Microsoft Clippy.
00:36:10 And I'm like, oh, no, you've got the face of my person.
00:36:13 I know that's soul.
00:36:16 But you but all you could all you can do is is tell me is recommend me
00:36:20 how to like improve my document writing.
00:36:22 And I'm like, this isn't what you're like.
00:36:24 This is fucked up.
00:36:26 Yeah, not real.
00:36:27 Yeah, ghoulish.
00:36:29 That would be a little bit.
00:36:30 I guess, did he know his brother?
00:36:33 No, he didn't even know he had a brother.
00:36:35 They were I think they were like twins or something.
00:36:37 And like one of them like had like a congenital problem
00:36:41 like when they were born and died like pretty much immediately
00:36:44 or was going to die like shortly after childbirth or something like that.
00:36:49 OK, I guess since he didn't know him before,
00:36:51 it's a little less freaky for that person.
00:36:54 But he didn't he didn't know.
00:36:57 But MegaMan.exe did know that he was like your long lost brother
00:37:01 the whole time and just didn't tell you because your dad like programmed him
00:37:05 not to tell you. Oh, you bet that.
00:37:09 That's.
00:37:11 It's sentient, but he can have his brain altered in the net.
00:37:15 I can have like folders of memories digitized,
00:37:20 but reshuffled and deleted.
00:37:22 Actually, I'm not 100 percent sure if he was like programmed not to tell you
00:37:26 or if just like the dad like just asked him not to tell you.
00:37:29 And he said like, OK, I'm not sure which it is.
00:37:32 I I'll have to find out soon.
00:37:39 And, you know, the sequel series to Battle Network Star Force.
00:37:44 Apparently, it takes place about 200 years in the future.
00:37:47 So about at the same time as MegaMan Zero happens
00:37:53 is when the battle network world like goes to space and like aliens are there.
00:38:00 I think that's zero.
00:38:03 Does zero have aliens? Zero does not have aliens.
00:38:06 No, zero is is like in the far future,
00:38:09 X has become or like the copy of X has become the like emperor
00:38:12 of the Neo-Arcadian Empire and is like ruling with like an iron fist.
00:38:17 Oh, yeah, and like fascist dictatorship.
00:38:21 And then there's the anti-reploit.
00:38:23 The the cop, the copy of X has become this fascist dictator
00:38:27 who is persecuting reploids and the real X has become a cyber.
00:38:31 Ralph, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:38:34 There's no aliens.
00:38:35 But in no, in in in the battle network timeline,
00:38:39 yeah, there's a sequel series called Star Force, where they go into space.
00:38:46 And I don't really know that much about it other than that.
00:38:49 I know that you like merge with an alien.
00:38:53 And you become and there are wizards.
00:38:57 There are wizards and aliens and I get.
00:39:04 But it's all the same because it's all on the Internet.
00:39:06 You can't tell. But it's but it's all on the Internet, I think.
00:39:09 I think that like the alien, I think that like you and an alien have like your
00:39:15 you each have like an individual
00:39:18 like data self representation that you put into the Internet.
00:39:22 And then you like merge them together into like a a shared being on the Internet.
00:39:28 You know what, I'm this is like half remembered stuff that I don't even know.
00:39:35 So this is I have to I'll have to discover this seven games or nine games from now.
00:39:40 Oh, those games are long as fuck.
00:39:43 Those games are like 30 hours long because they're like fully realized JRPGs on the freaking DS.
00:39:52 Just like bigger than PlayStation games.
00:39:55 So that's a nightmare.
00:39:57 It's going to be one of those games where like, oh, if you want to if you want to get
00:40:01 some secret extra law, you're going to have to fill out the best bestiary.
00:40:05 And yeah, I'm not going to do that and do like a hundred percent completion.
00:40:08 Then you get a sentence from somebody and he says, I'm Dr.
00:40:14 Light is alive and he's here.
00:40:17 Here he is. No, I didn't even I didn't even I didn't a hundred
00:40:22 percent all like Mega Man games like I didn't even play through.
00:40:26 This probably the biggest thing that I didn't do was I didn't play through
00:40:29 Mega Man X for as zero.
00:40:33 I only played through as X and like zero's play through is kind of like the more
00:40:36 canon of the of the two.
00:40:40 You talked about the the different playthroughs, though, right?
00:40:43 In the lecture, I did.
00:40:44 Yeah, I only played one of them.
00:40:47 I mean, gameplay wise, they're mostly the same.
00:40:49 It's just like slightly different bosses and like the dialogue you.
00:40:53 Oh, well, I mean, zero doesn't collect the light capsule upgrades, but like whatever.
00:40:58 I just I mean, I looked up the differences in any of them all.
00:41:02 But but yeah, that game's two different
00:41:04 playthroughs for the two different characters and I only did one and that's
00:41:09 and I kind of did the wrong one zeros is like
00:41:13 because zeros has like Iris, it has it has the famous cutscene
00:41:17 X's X's play that doesn't even have that cutscene.
00:41:21 Ah, so he was just fighting for something without even questioning it.
00:41:25 Yeah, X doesn't even ask at least zero asks what he's fighting for.
00:41:31 X doesn't even ask.
00:41:34 I just love killing.
00:41:36 He just that's the thing about X is that he just loves killing so much.
00:41:40 Mega Man X is a game series about a robot who just loves to kill.
00:41:49 He's highly, highly relatable.
00:41:52 Yeah, so I'm going to be doing that for a while.
00:41:55 You know what I think I'm going to do?
00:41:57 I think if I'm going to keep doing this, I should make like an announcement
00:42:00 video on YouTube and put on my YouTube channel like, hey, guys,
00:42:04 I'd like to make a follow up to the Mega Man lecture about Battle Network,
00:42:08 but I want to play the games first.
00:42:10 So I'm playing them on Twitch.
00:42:13 Follow me on Twitch.
00:42:15 I think that would be a reasonable way to drive
00:42:17 some eyes toward my Twitch channel if I'm going to be doing that.
00:42:21 Yeah, put it up the next time you go live or to, yeah.
00:42:26 Yeah, live when you're live.
00:42:28 It'd be like, oh, got to go right now.
00:42:30 I probably would put it out like.
00:42:34 I would probably say like I'll be I'll be live this Friday or something.
00:42:38 Like I would pronounce in advance, like.
00:42:42 I'll be I'll be doing it like this Friday.
00:42:44 I kind of want to do like maybe a Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
00:42:48 or maybe just like a Monday, Friday kind of schedule with it is something.
00:42:53 I don't. But I also don't want to.
00:42:54 I don't want to commit to a schedule because I hate commitment.
00:42:57 But also, I feel like I should do that if I'm going to announce it.
00:43:01 And if I want to tell people like you can watch me do this
00:43:05 and like here's when you can here's when I'll be doing it, you know,
00:43:09 like that's kind of the point of like announcing it.
00:43:12 Yeah. So I have to.
00:43:16 I was I was going to stream yesterday or I was going to stream on Friday.
00:43:21 I had kind of planned to, but I just didn't feel up to it.
00:43:26 I just didn't want to.
00:43:27 So I didn't because I hadn't really like committed to doing it on a schedule yet.
00:43:34 And I was the problem. Yeah.
00:43:38 It's like I guess not do it.
00:43:40 I like to be able to just not do it if I don't want to.
00:43:43 But also being on a schedule is good and it makes you do things.
00:43:48 Yeah.
00:43:50 And generally doing things is better than not doing them.
00:43:54 Hmm. Well, I don't know.
00:43:58 What if what if you did nothing?
00:44:01 What if you just laid face down?
00:44:05 Yeah, in the dirt. Yeah.
00:44:08 That's what I'm thinking.
00:44:11 That's what I'm like.
00:44:12 Stream that. No.
00:44:16 CCT likes hot wire, a CCTV camera lying the dirt face down.
00:44:22 Ben St is live.
00:44:25 Why are you why you got a why we got a why we got to make content out of everything?
00:44:30 If I want to just lie that face down in the dirt,
00:44:33 I should do it just for my own sake.
00:44:36 But what if you're lying face down in the dirt
00:44:37 and there's a little jingle goes off, somebody donated.
00:44:40 That would be the funniest clip.
00:44:42 Me like face down in the dirt like.
00:44:45 Little thing.
00:44:46 Thank you. Thank you for the follow.
00:44:49 Yeah, I'm sorry.
00:44:51 I'm not going to look and see who followed, but whoever you are.
00:44:53 Thank you. OK, leave me alone.
00:44:56 Yeah.
00:45:01 Feeling I'm feeling a little I'm feeling a little demotivated lately.
00:45:07 Yeah, I'm trying to push.
00:45:08 I'm trying to push myself with stuff like this,
00:45:10 like stuff like I'm going to start streaming again.
00:45:14 I'm going to make I want to start working.
00:45:16 I need to release.
00:45:17 Well, I haven't really started a new lecture yet
00:45:20 because I've still been trying to grind that fucking the book.
00:45:24 OK, not to not to derail myself,
00:45:26 but I must complain again about how seemingly endless
00:45:31 and never ending and impossible.
00:45:33 The task of like satisfactorily putting the stupid fucking index together
00:45:38 is and it feels like I'll never be done.
00:45:42 But that's what I've been doing.
00:45:45 And again, I don't know, I just got to finish it.
00:45:51 And then I want to start working on a new lecture.
00:45:54 I haven't really started another one, even though I need to.
00:45:57 And I've been streaming and stuff.
00:45:59 And it's like, OK, I got to I should probably commit.
00:46:01 I should probably commit to doing that again.
00:46:04 But I feel I feel overwhelmed.
00:46:06 I feel overwhelmed by all of it. There's too many things.
00:46:10 Now, I feel you.
00:46:11 I mean, at least you're doing a little bit of something,
00:46:13 a little bit of indexing.
00:46:15 I'm trying. I'm trying to I'm trying to chip away at stuff.
00:46:22 I felt I was I seriously worked like all last night on it.
00:46:27 And it. I did make progress, but like I look at the whole document
00:46:32 and I'm like, how have I been?
00:46:33 It's literally been like months.
00:46:34 I've literally been doing this shit for months.
00:46:36 And like, how is it not even? It's not even like.
00:46:39 I guess it's getting there, but like it's not.
00:46:41 I wouldn't say it's like almost done.
00:46:43 It's mostly done.
00:46:46 Nevermind.
00:46:48 That's it.
00:46:49 I mean, I felt pretty overwhelmed as well with.
00:46:55 Obligations and projects and like that's a new year, you know.
00:47:01 Yeah, get to work for holidays are over.
00:47:04 Yeah, got to get something done.
00:47:07 Yes, stupid idiot.
00:47:11 Famously, I said that the book that I would have the book done by New Year's
00:47:15 and it's not done.
00:47:18 Yeah, it's just I don't know what if what if nothing happened?
00:47:26 I'm thinking about it more and more and I'm like, you know what?
00:47:30 I don't want to never do anything ever again.
00:47:33 But but it's it's it's it's not.
00:47:39 It's not doing me any favors constantly feeling stressed out
00:47:43 about everything.
00:47:45 So I don't know.
00:47:46 So are you saying you are stressed because of how many things you want to do?
00:47:55 Yeah. Yeah.
00:47:57 Overwhelmed, stressed, you know.
00:48:00 Yeah.
00:48:02 And it's it's it's not a simple like, oh, just do it or oh, just take a break.
00:48:07 Sort of thing, because it's like can't take a break forever on everything.
00:48:12 Yeah. And doing it.
00:48:16 Is just so hard, especially when it's a creative thing and I need to like focus.
00:48:22 Yeah. And it's like I just.
00:48:26 I don't know.
00:48:27 I've just been playing.
00:48:29 Well, I guess I've been I've been binging medical sore.
00:48:31 That's what I've been doing until that's that was finished.
00:48:34 Now that's finished.
00:48:36 I don't know what I'm doing.
00:48:37 I'm just sort of waking up.
00:48:38 I'm feeling very feeling very numb.
00:48:40 He's telling you what you're doing.
00:48:42 I'll tell you what you're doing.
00:48:45 You know, you're playing inscription again.
00:48:49 You got to finish inscription, Gabe.
00:48:50 You didn't finish inscription.
00:48:52 Oh, but I don't care.
00:48:54 You didn't get to the twists.
00:48:56 There are two.
00:48:57 Oh, what's the twist?
00:48:58 The butler is the one giving me a card.
00:49:02 Like the butler, two T's.
00:49:05 Yes.
00:49:08 Look, it's a good game.
00:49:09 All right. Look, I know it's a good game.
00:49:11 OK, sometimes a good game.
00:49:13 You didn't look all right.
00:49:14 I just you didn't you didn't you didn't you didn't experience.
00:49:17 It's true. It's riches. OK.
00:49:20 It has it has undiscovered riches.
00:49:22 It's hard, Ben.
00:49:24 It requires that I play it and gosh darn it.
00:49:27 I'm a casual and I don't run away from that fact.
00:49:31 In fact, it's my identity.
00:49:34 I identify strongly with casual gamer.
00:49:38 It's not.
00:49:39 I don't like it when it's a game is hard and I lose.
00:49:43 It hurts my soul.
00:49:44 I don't fragments it.
00:49:45 I don't want to go.
00:49:46 Look, OK, look, I know.
00:49:47 I know I'm trying to keep it.
00:49:50 I'm trying to operate.
00:49:51 I'm trying to keep a cool head, but I must.
00:49:54 But I must.
00:49:56 But I must once again say that losing losing is part of the game.
00:50:00 You're supposed to lose it a bunch of times.
00:50:02 And every time you lose it, it gives you more stuff that you can.
00:50:05 That's what they say about real life, but it's false.
00:50:07 No, that that definitely is not that definitely is not true of real life.
00:50:12 Definitely not.
00:50:13 You're supposed to lose and you get nothing.
00:50:15 No, every time you lose in real life, you get worse and worse
00:50:18 and your situation degrades more and more.
00:50:20 Every time you lose, that's the the the the escapist fantasy of inscription
00:50:23 is that every time you lose, you get better and better and you get more stuff.
00:50:27 You know, what I like.
00:50:28 Only it were like that.
00:50:30 I like playing a fucking catamari to mercy.
00:50:33 You know what you do in that?
00:50:34 You roll around and you get bigger and bigger and then you win.
00:50:37 That's a that's understand.
00:50:38 Well, no, you can we can lose.
00:50:41 Honestly, I've lost catamari a lot of times.
00:50:43 I've found it kind of frustrating when I don't I don't get on a roll and I lose.
00:50:47 Oh, no, I'm too good at that game.
00:50:49 And I guess I'm so good at that.
00:50:51 I'm so fucking good at catamari.
00:50:53 I never lose.
00:50:54 I have. Except I I lose on the ones that are like weird missions
00:50:58 where you have to get one bear, like when you're trying to make Ursa major,
00:51:03 you need to get one bear.
00:51:05 And there are lots of things that count as bears or cows.
00:51:07 There's another one about cows.
00:51:10 And if you get like a milk carton that counts.
00:51:13 And so you have to avoid picking up certain things until you're big enough
00:51:18 to pick up like a big cow.
00:51:19 I hate those ones because it I want to collect everything.
00:51:23 Yeah.
00:51:25 But any any normal mission I usually am fine with.
00:51:28 Like I beat those had missions that are like I just can't.
00:51:34 I can't maneuver around.
00:51:35 I'm not finding the places I need to go where like this stuff is just the right
00:51:39 size for me to be, you know, growing.
00:51:44 I mean, yeah, there's some learning curve to to knowing how big you are
00:51:48 and how big where the where to go.
00:51:51 And maneuvering is like what my my big tip to Katamari Demas years
00:51:56 we're having trouble maneuvering is the double tap, like click in L3R3
00:52:02 to jump over to the other side of the ball, which is basically like a 180
00:52:06 without having to slow down.
00:52:08 You just do a 180 and you can easily change your direction completely,
00:52:15 which is very good for zigzagging, picking up things instead of smashing
00:52:18 into something and slowly turning around and then going at it again.
00:52:26 Anyway, Katamari is easy.
00:52:28 It's that's even if you fail, it's just fun clicking, getting getting little bits
00:52:33 getting bigger. Yeah. Yeah.
00:52:39 I played it and I never got like super into it.
00:52:42 Really good.
00:52:43 I think I just like I think I really rented it at some point.
00:52:47 They made a they never sold the original game in the UK.
00:52:52 So I have only played it.
00:52:54 Well, actually, I played it at in America, I think at Red Con 3.
00:52:59 I think we had it.
00:53:01 Is this think Trixie had it?
00:53:05 But then that's on steam.
00:53:07 There's a PhD remake of the first game.
00:53:10 It's great.
00:53:13 Get that one.
00:53:15 Oh, I just remember it.
00:53:18 I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be on a on a on a draw cast,
00:53:22 like oblivion oblivion falls draw cast this afternoon.
00:53:29 We're really busy Sunday today.
00:53:32 What what's the the theme?
00:53:35 I think he said that the theme is.
00:53:42 If I remember correctly, it's like you're supposed to first you draw
00:53:44 like an an edgy OC like like a do not like a like a do not steal
00:53:50 deviant are edgy OC and then you like swap with someone and you like fix each
00:53:55 other's edgy OC's or I think that's that's like that.
00:54:01 I feel like I did one of those with them.
00:54:06 I remember I remember drawing a shitty OC.
00:54:09 And then I also drew I think Seatull drew like a Ben Saint OC.
00:54:17 And I drew that I think I can't remember.
00:54:21 I have those images in my folder.
00:54:22 Occasionally, I remember like I see them.
00:54:24 I'm like, oh, yeah, that was a weird one.
00:54:30 I don't know if that became a video.
00:54:31 It probably did.
00:54:32 They still have not finished the freaking art telephone.
00:54:36 I hate my drawing for that.
00:54:38 I'm glad it's not out.
00:54:39 I'm glad it will never come out.
00:54:41 Mine was never to see it.
00:54:43 Mine was OK.
00:54:44 I don't know.
00:54:45 I kind of like.
00:54:47 I always like wanted that to happen and then it like has been like a year
00:54:50 and it like has not happened.
00:54:53 I feel like it's time to just cut anyone who has not completed their freaking
00:54:57 drawing for that.
00:54:58 But maybe it's too late.
00:55:03 Bummer.
00:55:04 Bummer.
00:55:10 Anyway, I'm feeling feeling a little bit
00:55:13 feeling a little pressed, even though that's literally not for like six hours.
00:55:17 But you know how it is.
00:55:17 It's like, oh, no, I got to do something six hours from now or I can't do anything.
00:55:22 Yeah.
00:55:23 I can't start anything now.
00:55:25 I don't only have five hours to do it in.
00:55:28 I think.
00:55:30 The last time I was on a draw cast.
00:55:33 Actually, no, they've asked for people.
00:55:36 Just randomly and they usually record like one a.m.
00:55:40 And I'm like, I don't know.
00:55:42 There's a slot for you.
00:55:43 Did somebody help?
00:55:44 I'm like, I don't know.
00:55:46 It's fucking late.
00:55:47 Right.
00:55:50 Time zines.
00:55:56 Well, what else have I been doing this week?
00:55:59 I don't know.
00:56:00 I found a YouTube guy that I like.
00:56:03 He's called the Burger Creek.
00:56:06 And he made. OK.
00:56:08 He's made a bunch of he's made a bunch of lore videos explaining the lore
00:56:13 of World of Darkness.
00:56:14 Do you know what that is?
00:56:17 Is that the
00:56:20 French designer
00:56:22 SNES game?
00:56:24 No, it's not the guy who made something or is it like
00:56:31 it's the is it the one with the Mike Gruber guy, the little egghead man?
00:56:36 Oh, no, you're talking about
00:56:39 another world.
00:56:40 Another world. I think it's in Europe.
00:56:42 It's called another world in America.
00:56:44 I think it's called out of this world or something like that.
00:56:48 And then there was another game by that same guy who did on SNES.
00:56:53 The like black with like shadow hands.
00:56:56 The black shadow hands and then the kid with the little laser gun.
00:57:01 I know what you mean.
00:57:02 I watched Game Grumps play. It was very cool.
00:57:05 I know what you're talking about, but that's not what I am talking about.
00:57:10 World of Darkness is a like it's a set
00:57:14 of like tabletop RPGs that all kind of like work together with each other.
00:57:20 So like they're all kind of set in the same world and they're like compatible with each other.
00:57:25 The main one is is Vampire the Masquerade, where you play as vampires.
00:57:30 But there's like a werewolf one.
00:57:31 There's one about being ghosts.
00:57:34 There's one about being wizards.
00:57:38 There's a couple others, I think.
00:57:40 But anyway, yeah, World of Darkness is this like set of games.
00:57:44 And this guy, the Burger Creek, he's made a bunch of like lower videos explaining the lore of each one.
00:57:50 And he also has made a bunch of like.
00:57:54 Like philosophy, like history videos.
00:57:58 It's stuff that like I have not watched that.
00:58:00 But the funny thing about Burger Creek is that he just looks exactly like a Jesse,
00:58:05 but he's like German.
00:58:08 Oh, that's cool.
00:58:09 Let me let me show you what he looks like.
00:58:11 You can tell me if you agree with me or not.
00:58:13 Like complete with Hawaiian shirt.
00:58:16 No, he does not dress like Jesse.
00:58:19 He just has his face and hair.
00:58:21 Like I'm like, like, look at this, look at this.
00:58:26 Well, yeah, a little bit.
00:58:28 Yeah, his nose is bigger.
00:58:30 It's kind of got the hair.
00:58:31 Kind of got the hair.
00:58:32 Sort of got the beard.
00:58:34 And he's also standing in front of a very close behind bookshelf.
00:58:37 Yes.
00:58:39 I thought he was British at first because he speaks with a British accent.
00:58:43 But I think he's actually German and I think he just learned British English.
00:58:48 Um, he's talking into a sock.
00:58:51 Yeah, he just puts a sock over his microphone for some reason.
00:58:55 It's a pop filter.
00:58:56 Yeah, easy pop filter.
00:58:58 Yeah, it's funny.
00:59:00 He's he's he's got a bunch of he's got a bunch of videos about like masculinity.
00:59:07 But I think he's a leftoid, so it's probably OK.
00:59:13 Don't worry about it.
00:59:16 Uh, it is kind of on candy.
00:59:20 Yeah. Right.
00:59:23 I think it's something about the eyes, the very similar.
00:59:26 The eyes, the hair.
00:59:28 Yeah, I just I just saw this guy in a thumbnail.
00:59:32 And I saw he was he had like a long video talking about vampire clans.
00:59:37 That was like, I think he he used to do videos
00:59:41 like a couple years ago, and I think he like came back to it
00:59:44 like this year and he had a big hit.
00:59:46 But he did like a like a two or three hour video where he explained
00:59:50 all like the lore of all the clans in in Vampire, the masquerade.
00:59:55 And I guess that was like sort of a big hit.
00:59:58 And then he just he just did more of that.
01:00:01 And that's what you do.
01:00:02 That's what you do on the Internet.
01:00:03 You just play the hits.
01:00:06 You just play the hits.
01:00:09 Duh, I stopped working.
01:00:14 What was that?
01:00:16 No, my brain stopped working.
01:00:17 Oh, yeah, no, it's fine.
01:00:21 I don't know. Yeah, I've been watching like a bunch of this guy's crap.
01:00:24 They did they did a new GDC or GDQ, rather.
01:00:28 That was there was one like last week.
01:00:30 I didn't even realize.
01:00:32 Game's done quietly.
01:00:34 But now, yes, because I didn't hear about it.
01:00:36 But now there's a bunch of new.
01:00:38 There's a new Final Fantasy 7 speedrun that I watched.
01:00:41 That was great.
01:00:45 You know, I never go into those.
01:00:48 I always forget that I can watch speedruns of any game I want.
01:00:51 I have watched a lot.
01:00:53 I don't usually watch them live.
01:00:55 I just watch the VODs.
01:00:57 Yeah, yeah.
01:01:00 Like, oh, oh, a game I like.
01:01:02 I wonder if there's a speedrun.
01:01:03 Well, of course there is.
01:01:04 But is it fun? Is it cool?
01:01:06 Is it interesting?
01:01:08 Often not.
01:01:10 I usually prefer better than like a like a live recorded VOD
01:01:16 of a speedrun from GDQ.
01:01:18 What's the what's better than that is like a commentated speedrun.
01:01:23 Oh, yeah, those are always nice.
01:01:25 Have you seen the ones about Kirby?
01:01:29 Hang on. I've seen ones where there's like a person playing
01:01:32 and another person commentating what's being done
01:01:36 or like the person playing is commentating.
01:01:38 I like those.
01:01:39 There's a yeah, there's a there's a channel called Sample
01:01:43 and he has he has a video with one point one million views
01:01:46 and it's a commentated task of Kirby Super Star Ultra 100 percent
01:01:50 in an hour thirty five.
01:01:52 And that one's really good because like
01:01:56 the movement tech that he uses in the task is like really interesting.
01:02:00 Like the way that he uses different powers in like a weird way
01:02:03 to like squeeze the most movement potential out of them
01:02:05 is like just really just really neat.
01:02:11 I think I've seen a few speedruns of games that I like
01:02:15 or games from childhood games that I know what it's like to play through.
01:02:21 And I often like ratchet and clank.
01:02:23 I don't like watching the speedruns for that for some reason.
01:02:26 And I think it's because there's so many glitches involved
01:02:29 that doesn't feel relatable.
01:02:32 Doesn't feel like playing the game.
01:02:34 It doesn't feel like I'm watching somebody play this game
01:02:36 that I know with extreme precision, precision that I could not achieve.
01:02:41 Now, they're doing glitches and like skipping past areas.
01:02:44 I'm like, but what if you did that area and just did it really well?
01:02:48 I'd like to see that.
01:02:49 But I don't know.
01:02:50 I guess I need need to specify like glitchless or exploitless runs of things.
01:02:56 I mean, I like especially with like old like NES games.
01:03:00 I do like to see when they like do weird shit that glitches the game out.
01:03:05 Like that is fun in its own way.
01:03:07 Oh, yeah.
01:03:08 Like when they scroll the screen in Metroid, you ever seen that?
01:03:12 I haven't I haven't seen, but I think I know what that there.
01:03:15 There's ways that you can like go up too high on the screen
01:03:18 that it like that it like overflows your position
01:03:21 and like scrolls you up from like the bottom and like just puts you on the bottom
01:03:25 of the screen and you can like skip you can skip like through floors and stuff that way.
01:03:31 Or like zips and Mega Man where like there's ways to position yourself inside a wall.
01:03:36 And when you're in a wall, the game tries to deposit you outside of the wall on the right side.
01:03:41 So we just like shoots you like across the whole level.
01:03:44 Sometimes if you're like inside a wall, that's like really long.
01:03:49 Very funny.
01:03:52 Oh, you know, it would be weird.
01:03:53 I don't know how, whether I'd like this or not, but like speed runs of strategy games
01:03:57 like Fire Emblem.
01:03:59 Like those are not just about how quickly you can do it, but like
01:04:03 you have to know the exact right thing to do.
01:04:06 And there's some some maps and some moments that will probably be like random numbers
01:04:11 will determine whether it's a good run or not, whether you get a crit at the right time
01:04:15 or whether they get a crit.
01:04:17 I think I've seen speed runs.
01:04:20 Oh, I think I've seen I saw a speed run of
01:04:24 Final Fantasy Tactics and they were explaining that like
01:04:29 they were using a route that like didn't involve numerology.
01:04:33 Do you know what that is?
01:04:37 Numbers.
01:04:38 Well, there. Well, there's like a shit.
01:04:40 I think there's like a there's like a particular class or there's like a particular NPC
01:04:45 that has like a unique class that has like some like highly random
01:04:52 abilities and there are ways to like there are ways to like cheese the RNG
01:04:56 that make this like a numeral this numerology ability like really strong.
01:05:00 Like you can you can cheese the results to get like things that are like way more
01:05:04 powerful than it's supposed to be or something like that.
01:05:07 But they were like
01:05:09 they had like developed a route that like didn't involve that
01:05:11 because that like trivialized the game or something.
01:05:15 So yeah.
01:05:18 There's no.
01:05:20 I'm trying.
01:05:23 Yeah, game is like games is like strategy involves
01:05:27 or like, I mean, you ever watch Pokemon speed run where they're talking about like
01:05:32 I've seen so many challenge runs and I've seen glitchful speed runs,
01:05:38 but not like yeah, just regular speed runs of a Pokemon game.
01:05:42 They're the way the way they route it so that like
01:05:47 they'll they'll use like one mon and they'll like
01:05:51 like they know they know like which which NPCs have like AI that they can exploit
01:05:57 to like get an opportunity to like use all the like X items that they need
01:06:01 to like steamroll through the rest of the of the party and stuff.
01:06:06 Or like they'll know
01:06:09 like based on their EVs and based on like the moves, power and stuff,
01:06:14 like they'll know exactly like like when they'll be able to out speed
01:06:18 in one shot, everything and they'll like they'll carefully plan their route.
01:06:22 So like they get there at the exact time that they that they can do that without any risk.
01:06:29 It's interesting. Those are like really long, but they're fine.
01:06:33 Now, I watch a lot of speed runs.
01:06:37 Oh, I just remembered like a.
01:06:40 A tactic in Fire Emblem or at least in the Fire Emblem
01:06:45 on GBA that I remember.
01:06:47 I want I remember it's such a weird it's a random number like manipulation tactic.
01:06:54 That you can use to guarantee high stats on a level up.
01:06:58 It was like in which game Fire Emblem 7 on GBA.
01:07:02 I guess on Fire Emblem 8 as well.
01:07:04 It could be other ones like the because when you when you level up,
01:07:09 you gain like a random bonus to a bunch of different stats.
01:07:12 Yeah, you gain random bonuses to a bunch of different stats
01:07:14 and you want like a high role on each one of those stats.
01:07:19 Sometimes you get like plus one to health and that's it.
01:07:22 Sometimes you get plus one to health, speed, strength, skill,
01:07:26 defense and you know, everything.
01:07:29 And what you can do is since again, I don't know why this is the case.
01:07:37 When you play a map, the the numbers that are generated
01:07:44 are like they're set in stone kind of.
01:07:48 You can see what they are by doing some actions
01:07:52 and then load your point by like turning the game off
01:07:56 and then coming back to wherever you were.
01:07:59 And then it's hard to explain.
01:08:03 But like the series of saves saves coming your level up basically.
01:08:08 Yeah, you save like every every action is saved in Fire Emblem.
01:08:12 So if you move a unit, you can't like undo it.
01:08:14 You can't set a load, a point from that map that it's always saved,
01:08:19 which is always a cool part of like if you turned the console off,
01:08:24 it would remember because it's constantly saving,
01:08:28 which is to prevent saves coming.
01:08:29 But because of this, there's a way to check the random numbers
01:08:33 that are about to happen in the game that you're playing
01:08:38 by having a unit, selecting them and then moving their cursor
01:08:43 like a certain number of tiles away in a diagonal direction.
01:08:47 And then the arrow that indicates the path they'll take.
01:08:53 If it's two different potential paths to that one square,
01:08:59 the game will roll a random number to generate which arrow is shown,
01:09:03 whether it's go up and then right or right in an up.
01:09:08 And you can tell
01:09:11 whether it's a high or low number
01:09:15 based on whether it does one or the other.
01:09:17 And then you can write down whether it was a high number or low number.
01:09:20 And if you get like 23 like random numbers later,
01:09:25 you have like a high, a long string of high numbers rolled.
01:09:32 Then, you know, you turn the game off
01:09:35 and then you count up to that number.
01:09:38 You spend those random numbers, you generate them again
01:09:42 with the same arrow method, and then you level up, you kill an enemy,
01:09:46 you level up, and then they use the next set of random numbers
01:09:50 in the list that you already have predetermined.
01:09:53 You already know what they're going to be.
01:09:55 And so you level up and you get like a bunch of random numbers
01:09:58 that you've seen from the future.
01:10:00 I see.
01:10:02 It's it was so complicated when I was young.
01:10:04 I was like, what?
01:10:06 What the fuck?
01:10:07 But I remember spending like hours and hours trying to understand it.
01:10:10 And I think I've worked a couple of times.
01:10:13 It was just so time intensive because you had to like.
01:10:17 When you're ready to level up,
01:10:19 you have to like get into a position where you can kill an enemy and level up
01:10:23 and then do the arrow thing until you get a good string of numbers.
01:10:28 And it could just take forever until that happens.
01:10:32 Weird.
01:10:33 It's very weird.
01:10:35 How do you reset the timer, though?
01:10:37 Like or reset the numbers?
01:10:38 You can you just turn off and turn it on and like,
01:10:40 do you like save scum the numbers, basically?
01:10:42 You you you can leave the map or turn off the console
01:10:46 and it will have saved at that point.
01:10:48 I think the idea is it uses random numbers to generate the arrow,
01:10:54 but it doesn't bother saving after that point.
01:10:57 So like generating those arrow numbers, the game doesn't update.
01:11:02 It doesn't save your state.
01:11:04 So you can return to before you generated those numbers.
01:11:07 And for some reason, those numbers generate the exact same way every time.
01:11:11 Weird, weird.
01:11:13 So it's RNG manipulation.
01:11:15 That's my that's my big trivia about that.
01:11:20 That's fucked up.
01:11:21 How could you let that happen?
01:11:23 Because I was a nerd and I.
01:11:26 Fire Emblem was a very important game to me, but I sucked at it.
01:11:31 I lost so many times.
01:11:32 I was like, how do I become the strongest?
01:11:36 And they said, you do this.
01:11:37 Well, that explains it.
01:11:41 Video games, I watched them.
01:11:43 I've seen I've now seen every every video on Hazel's channel.
01:11:46 You know, Hazel.
01:11:47 Uh, she makes anime videos.
01:11:52 Oh, wait, I think I know all of them.
01:11:54 I never watched their video.
01:11:56 She did because it's because it is anime.
01:11:59 And I'm like, what the fuck?
01:12:01 So some of them are about anime.
01:12:04 Some of them are about like RPGs.
01:12:06 Some of them are about just like lost media in in general, but mostly anime.
01:12:12 Oh, she did one.
01:12:13 This one about the time Tokyo pop made a weeaboo reality show.
01:12:17 That one's really funny.
01:12:18 I'd never heard of that before.
01:12:20 Oh, I watched the one about.
01:12:22 Oh, the the the the the backstory of I can.
01:12:27 The like weird big boob anime by which I hear this one specifically
01:12:33 specifically this big boob anime.
01:12:36 Oh, this one's this one was really good.
01:12:40 Oh, yeah, I love that big boob anime.
01:12:42 No, you don't know you don't.
01:12:46 Was that the one, you know, I think when I was really young,
01:12:51 like 11 or 12 or whatever, I found something like this.
01:12:55 Maybe it was this.
01:12:55 I've seen this character somewhere and it was like, I was like, oh, my God.
01:13:00 Like I typed in boobs on Google and she showed up.
01:13:04 Yeah.
01:13:05 And I learned about it from that.
01:13:06 And I was like, oh, my God, you can watch that.
01:13:08 The funny that was there was a scene where the main character was like,
01:13:12 well, I tripped and I put my hands on the big boobies and that's wish.
01:13:17 That's what happened.
01:13:18 And I was like, I was like, oh, my God, that would be so cool.
01:13:22 It was before I realized this was a stupid trope.
01:13:26 I was like, I wish that could happen to me.
01:13:28 That's so funny and awesome and cool.
01:13:31 The funny OK, the takeaway that I learned from this is like, OK.
01:13:36 This anime exists.
01:13:39 It only exists because.
01:13:42 The guy drew the biggest boobs that had existed in anime up till that time.
01:13:47 That's the only that's like the only interesting thing about it at all.
01:13:52 It is the original manga has it legitimately has like dog shit art
01:13:57 and looks like garbage and the guy can't draw and it's shit.
01:14:02 And also the guy sucks.
01:14:04 And the next manga that he did after this was called like my bride is 12 years old.
01:14:10 But it's just about marrying a fucking grade school.
01:14:14 And there was a big like freaking there was a big freaking
01:14:18 political backlash against it.
01:14:21 Basically, basically Japanese legislation.
01:14:24 Remember when like freaking Joseph Lieberman and whatever?
01:14:27 We're all like, oh, doom is making kids shoot up schools.
01:14:31 Basically, basically Japan did that, but they did it with my bride
01:14:34 is an elementary schooler.
01:14:36 And they said like manga is turning our generation into like weak degenerates
01:14:40 and destroying traditional masculinity.
01:14:42 And you know what, God damn it, they had a freaking point.
01:14:46 They were in this one case.
01:14:49 The grade schooler.
01:14:50 I mean, how many grade schools got married as a result?
01:14:53 Huh, it was stats.
01:14:55 Well, I mean, damn, you got a point there.
01:14:59 But I don't know.
01:15:01 It's very it's very it was very interesting to learn what this freaking guy did.
01:15:06 This freaking big boob anime man.
01:15:09 Wow. Mm hmm.
01:15:10 Japan, huh?
01:15:12 I have watched them.
01:15:14 Oh, I learned something.
01:15:15 She she was using she used like video game level
01:15:20 as like background art in some shots.
01:15:23 And I looked she she she cited like where she got that from.
01:15:28 And it was this thing called let me find it.
01:15:31 Yeah, it was this thing called no clip, the note that no clip website.
01:15:36 And on. Oh, I've seen that.
01:15:38 You've seen. Yeah, I found this from her.
01:15:40 And if you can just go and you can freaking like put a camera anywhere
01:15:45 in like all these like old like PlayStation and Wii and GameCube games.
01:15:49 And you just put them anywhere in like a level in a video game.
01:15:53 And you can like film a little like Zoom shot.
01:15:57 In a video game, I'm looking at Okami.
01:16:00 I'm looking at the Divine Spring and Okami right now.
01:16:02 It looks great. I've also clicked on Okami.
01:16:04 I love it. I think I forget about it every so often.
01:16:07 And I'm like, yeah, what?
01:16:08 How does this work so well?
01:16:10 This is just the map data in a browser.
01:16:13 I'm leaving this frickin this frickin tab open.
01:16:16 I'm leaving this tab open forever.
01:16:19 We can get Fes. I mean, I'm in Cousa village right now.
01:16:22 Oh, I'm looking at Fez.
01:16:25 Oh, yeah. Fez. You can use WASD.
01:16:30 Use WASD Banjo-Kazooie fucking.
01:16:34 I like that they have like some of the models in there just sort of hanging out.
01:16:38 Oh, I was looking at the Jet Set Radio.
01:16:42 They have some of the games they have like textures for objects.
01:16:45 Also, not all of them.
01:16:47 Like Banjo-Kazooie has like little little eggs and some of the enemies.
01:16:52 Do they not have games from the original PlayStation?
01:16:56 I see PlayStation 2.
01:16:58 Maybe they're weirder like map files.
01:17:01 Xbox PC, Xbox PC.
01:17:04 Wait, what was Okami? Experimental.
01:17:06 Was Okami on the Wii?
01:17:08 Yeah.
01:17:10 I guess they just have the Wii version.
01:17:12 But that was on the PlayStation.
01:17:14 It was.
01:17:15 You saw it?
01:17:16 Maybe they can rip it from the Wii better than other things.
01:17:19 I mean, I guess they have a somewhat limited selection here.
01:17:24 Psychonauts.
01:17:27 The one level in Psychonauts that looks like a black velvet painting.
01:17:34 Black velvetopia, black velvetopia.
01:17:36 There we go.
01:17:37 I can zoom in on like on like the far off depictions of places from Del Fino Plaza.
01:17:45 I can see the low poly Del Fino Harbor stuff.
01:17:51 Oh, some of these.
01:17:55 Some of these actually look kind of bad.
01:17:57 Like some of them.
01:17:58 Some of them you look at and like very little of the level is actually textured.
01:18:04 And that's kind of disappointing.
01:18:07 Look at this.
01:18:08 Only so much you can do.
01:18:09 Well, how does it look good in the game if this is what the model looks like?
01:18:18 Like what is this?
01:18:20 Games that from?
01:18:21 It's from Psychonauts.
01:18:23 I'm not familiar.
01:18:24 But I guess there's lots of things that are not like rendering like in Super Mario Sunshine.
01:18:31 There's no heat wave for distant objects, which would obviously obscure stuff.
01:18:37 This is like basic models, textures, lighting sometimes.
01:18:45 Probably not procedurally generated, just sort of like like painted on or pre rendered
01:18:52 lighting shadows and stuff.
01:18:54 Is it like what the hell is this?
01:18:56 Is it like a lot of the like untextured areas?
01:19:00 Is it just like was there would there have just been like a flat texture like behind
01:19:04 like a skybox?
01:19:06 I don't know.
01:19:09 Yo, it's fucking Metroid Prime.
01:19:14 Sometimes there's just like shit floating around.
01:19:19 Look at this.
01:19:21 This weird image that says channel one.
01:19:25 And I don't know what that is.
01:19:28 That could be.
01:19:30 I assume they would have put a gift there or something or some kind of animation animated
01:19:36 texture.
01:19:37 Yeah, I'm not familiar with the game.
01:19:40 I played it a long time ago.
01:19:42 I don't exactly remember.
01:19:44 It could be an animation.
01:19:46 It could be like a video feed, like a camera that shows what's happening in game.
01:19:55 I mean, there definitely was not a yellow checkerboard that says channel one.
01:20:00 Would I have PlayStation 2 here?
01:20:02 I feel like maybe.
01:20:03 Okay.
01:20:04 You ever seen?
01:20:05 There's a Kingdom Hearts.
01:20:08 Yo, there's a I'm going to go to fucking.
01:20:11 Okay.
01:20:12 The Destiny Islands.
01:20:16 There's a there's a channel on YouTube that does this.
01:20:19 It like breaks games and it goes it like goes around in the levels and games.
01:20:24 And I remember I watched a video where it was exploring the levels in like it was Simpsons
01:20:29 hit and run.
01:20:30 And it's like, is that boundary break?
01:20:34 Yes.
01:20:35 Yes.
01:20:36 Boundary break.
01:20:37 And it's literally like parts of the level just have like flat textures.
01:20:42 And they're like just like hidden inside walls and stuff.
01:20:45 And it like the way that it will do cut scenes is it will literally just like take the in-game
01:20:51 camera and just put it in a place in the 3D level that just shows the image in the form
01:21:01 of like an in-game texture on like a flat plane.
01:21:05 But like that texture is just is just floating somewhere in the level.
01:21:08 And they just move the camera to point at that image and like that's how they show the
01:21:14 image.
01:21:15 Do you know what I mean?
01:21:16 I guess.
01:21:17 Yeah.
01:21:18 Yeah.
01:21:19 I know what you mean.
01:21:21 It's I think just because it's easier to move a camera's position that it is to load in
01:21:27 an image to show on screen, they just move the camera to wherever the scene needs to be.
01:21:33 That's why they have like, like, I don't know.
01:21:36 I can't remember if this is actually in Simpsons hit and run.
01:21:39 But like levels would be like just far below.
01:21:43 Like an interior would just be a little like model set that would be below the real level.
01:21:51 Yeah.
01:21:52 There were, I was looking at some of these levels and you know, Kami, I saw there were
01:21:57 some levels that, yeah, like one area will actually have multiple different like areas
01:22:03 in it.
01:22:04 And they're just sort of like separated.
01:22:08 But like it's one map that just has a bunch of these like kind of rooms sort of built
01:22:13 into it.
01:22:14 And they're technically the same area.
01:22:17 You're just like positioned differently inside of them.
01:22:22 And they may or may not even like have any relation to each other in game in context.
01:22:29 Oh my God, I love video games.
01:22:32 I do love video games.
01:22:34 Do you?
01:22:35 Okay.
01:22:36 Do you ever watch?
01:22:37 Do you ever watch any?
01:22:39 Okay.
01:22:40 Well, there's two different things.
01:22:41 Any John Boyce documentaries and or Bobby Broccoli videos.
01:22:47 I think you talked about John Boyce.
01:22:49 He did the baseball stuff.
01:22:52 He does.
01:22:53 He does many sports related documentary type videos.
01:22:57 Okay.
01:22:58 But you, but you haven't, you're not familiar.
01:23:00 No.
01:23:01 You don't know Bobby Broccoli?
01:23:03 Nope.
01:23:04 Okay.
01:23:05 I think it, okay.
01:23:06 I think, I think it was Chip Wiseman that turned me on to this, but I could be misremembering.
01:23:13 But yeah, I noted that like Bobby Broccoli makes videos that are basically the same.
01:23:21 Like he uses the same like format as John Boyce did.
01:23:25 And I noticed that like there's only these two channels that I'm aware of that do this
01:23:29 very particular style of video making wherein they'll have like a graph or they'll have
01:23:37 some sort of a data.
01:23:42 What do you, what do you call it in infographic?
01:23:44 They'll have like, they'll build like a graph or an infographic showing some information.
01:23:48 And what they'll do is they'll have, they'll have, have it in like a 3D space and they'll
01:23:52 kind of swoosh the camera around to show the graph.
01:23:55 And then maybe they'll have like, you know, points appear on the graph and you'll sort
01:24:00 of watch them like animate and like appear and the data will appear and it will, you
01:24:05 know, form some pattern and they'll talk about it.
01:24:09 And yeah, they, they do this thing and they swoosh it around in the 3D environment.
01:24:14 And I mentioned this and someone, and I think it was Chip Wiseman said, yeah, they, Bobby
01:24:21 Broccoli made a video that's just explaining how they do it and the video is called how
01:24:26 to make videos like John Boyce.
01:24:29 So Bobby Broccoli is explicitly like, yes, I stole my method from John Boyce and like
01:24:33 good on him.
01:24:34 You know, I admire the gumption.
01:24:37 And it turns out, and I couldn't fucking believe this, you will never, they actually make the
01:24:43 videos in Google Earth.
01:24:45 Like Google Earth has like video making tools in it.
01:24:49 Well, like, did you, like, did you know that?
01:24:51 Like, like you can set a key frame and a camera move in Google Earth.
01:24:54 Yes.
01:24:55 Yes.
01:24:56 And you, and you can load 3D models.
01:24:58 You can load 3D models into Google Earth.
01:25:00 I, I assumed the, okay, John Boyce made the first thing I ever saw of him was 17776, which
01:25:09 is that sort of like almost, it's a bit homestuckish, but not really.
01:25:13 It's a comic, but it includes videos and it's set in the future.
01:25:19 And he'll show like a, like a Google Earth landscape, but in Google Earth, he will have
01:25:25 these like, he'll have like fantastical structures and like things that don't exist sort of placed
01:25:30 on top of Google Earth.
01:25:31 And it's like, oh, in the future, this, this thing is here and it's some weird building.
01:25:38 Turns out, and I assumed he was using Google Earth and then like taking Google Earth footage
01:25:43 and putting something into it or putting superimposing an image or maybe loading Google Earth models
01:25:50 into some other thing like Blender or something.
01:25:52 No, you can just straight up load 3D models into Google Earth and then use like fricking
01:25:58 video tools and key frames and stuff in Google Earth to like record in software footage in
01:26:05 Google Earth.
01:26:06 That's what Bobby Broccoli does too.
01:26:07 He just loads Google Earth, turns off the Earth, so it's just in like a black void.
01:26:12 And then he just puts these infographics into the Google Earth software and that's it.
01:26:17 That's the whole method.
01:26:19 And I can't fucking believe because it's so good.
01:26:23 It's like really good.
01:26:24 The result rules.
01:26:26 Yeah.
01:26:27 Why would Google Earth have that built in?
01:26:32 I guess they anticipated that people would want to make videos using it, but like I've
01:26:39 never seen anyone do it other than John Boyce and then Bobby Broccoli.
01:26:45 But they don't, I mean John Boyce will sometimes, he'll use the Earth itself and he'll use it
01:26:50 as like, he'll show a location where he's talking about it.
01:26:53 Bobby doesn't even use the Earth.
01:26:55 He has everything just floating in a void.
01:26:59 And it's just, it's amazing.
01:27:02 It's amazing to me because I'm sure that they did not, I'm sure that the creators of Google
01:27:09 Earth did not intend for it to be used to make documentaries, but they put these video
01:27:16 making tools in it and just because of the way that they built that into it, these documentary
01:27:23 videos became possible to make and John just did that.
01:27:29 Well, what were the, like what did they expect?
01:27:34 Like if they had video making capabilities.
01:27:37 Well, I don't know.
01:27:39 I genuinely don't know.
01:27:41 We're a business and here's our video.
01:27:43 You see, we want to build our new structure on this straight here, swoop.
01:27:49 Maybe.
01:27:50 Look at it with the, it'll add to the skyline.
01:27:55 Maybe it was assumed that like, yeah, using rendered footage from Google Earth would be,
01:28:04 yeah, just useful for like, showing the locations of things or showing like, geographic data.
01:28:12 I don't know.
01:28:14 Yeah, that's maybe the biggest question that leaves me with is why does Google Earth have
01:28:20 this functionality?
01:28:24 Google probably doesn't know.
01:28:26 You could, I mean, you could theoretically just like, just fricking use a screen capture
01:28:31 software to record Google Earth footage.
01:28:35 Does that mean I could put like a little model, like a little punk model in Google Earth and
01:28:39 have her destroy all the buildings?
01:28:41 Bobby Broccoli has a video explaining step by step exactly how to load 3D models into
01:28:47 Google Earth and make videos with them.
01:28:51 So if you can make videos, can you make an interactive something or other?
01:28:55 That would be so cool if you could like make a game, because you can already make.
01:28:59 I mean, you can't like program like game logic into it.
01:29:03 No, but it would be so cool if you could take the Google Maps, like when they do like 3D,
01:29:09 like the little 3D versions of instead of just a flat image, and you can have a little
01:29:14 character run around and jump on them.
01:29:16 That'd be cool.
01:29:18 I mean, you would have to animate it and then load the animation into the into the Earth.
01:29:25 Yeah, it wouldn't be the animation software.
01:29:27 I'm thinking of like somehow getting the data to do that.
01:29:32 Because what's the game that uses, what's it called?
01:29:37 GeoGuessr.
01:29:38 GeoGuessr uses Google Earth data to make its game.
01:29:42 Hmm.
01:29:44 I don't know.
01:29:47 You know GeoGuessr, right?
01:29:49 Sort of.
01:29:50 It's a game where it plops you down in a random Google Street View area and you have to guess
01:29:57 where you are.
01:29:59 And it knows the location, so they have the Google data and they make a game out of it.
01:30:08 I don't know anything about that.
01:30:14 It's fun.
01:30:16 Hmm.
01:30:17 I'm sorry, I'm trying to find this video.
01:30:19 I thought someone linked it to me in the PCP, frickin, in the PCP server.
01:30:28 Kirby Return to Dream Land.
01:30:30 Cookie Country.
01:30:32 Yo.
01:30:33 Yo, what the fuck?
01:30:36 Wait, what?
01:30:37 Kirby Return to Dream Land, two-dimensional game, you know, with a 3D background.
01:30:42 And now you can go into the 3D background.
01:30:45 Return to Dream Land is so beautiful.
01:30:48 I found the video.
01:30:50 Raising Road.
01:30:52 It's called How to Animate in Google Earth Like John Boyce by Bobby Broccoli.
01:30:57 He posted it two years ago.
01:30:59 Well, this is interesting.
01:31:01 The Kirby Return to Dream Land is just the background.
01:31:03 There is no level.
01:31:05 Are you still looking at what's it called, no clip?
01:31:08 Yeah.
01:31:09 Mario Kart.
01:31:10 Oh, I can pretend to Mario Kart.
01:31:12 I'm going so quick.
01:31:13 You can just use WASD and go...
01:31:16 Yeah, WASD and then like right arrow, right mouse button.
01:31:20 Mm-hmm.
01:31:21 Mm-hmm.
01:31:22 Aw.
01:31:27 Bobby says in the comments of these,
01:31:28 it was pointed out to me that the best way to animate scrolling without zoom outs and zoom ins is not actually to use a path.
01:31:35 Paths have weird camera restrictions.
01:31:37 The easier and more versatile method is to just record yourself manually pressing the arrow keys to scroll.
01:31:43 Well, that sounds inconvenient.
01:31:47 Holy shit.
01:31:48 I wouldn't the tool be better, but okay, sure, whatever.
01:31:53 Did you try Pokemon Platinum?
01:31:56 No, I still haven't played it.
01:31:58 No, I mean like in no clip because the entire map, the entire game is one big model.
01:32:04 What?
01:32:05 Hang on.
01:32:06 The entire Sinnoh region or whatever.
01:32:08 I'm flying over it.
01:32:10 Is that on the DS?
01:32:12 Yeah, I think so.
01:32:14 Sinnoh region and underground.
01:32:16 Wow, yeah, there's only two maps.
01:32:20 Let's check it out.
01:32:22 These little Pokemon Sinnohs are so cute.
01:32:27 Oh, it's in 3D.
01:32:29 Yeah.
01:32:30 Oh my god, it actually looks great.
01:32:33 What are these big black beams coming out of a...
01:32:38 Beams?
01:32:39 What is that?
01:32:40 There's these two like black beams emanating from...
01:32:44 Are they like spotlights?
01:32:46 They're coming out of...
01:32:50 Let me get a little image that kind of shows what I'm talking about.
01:32:55 All the trees are slanted in the direction of the camera, that's funny.
01:33:01 This.
01:33:02 And they have like the flat...
01:33:04 Oh, they have the log texture just flatly on the ground underneath.
01:33:08 Oh, because you only see them from up above.
01:33:11 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, lol.
01:33:13 Because the tree is just a sprite.
01:33:16 Yeah, the tree can shake, right, in the wind.
01:33:20 Oh my god, they're all tilted.
01:33:22 They're all like a tilted flat sprite floating in the air.
01:33:25 The log is just a flat texture.
01:33:28 Holy shit.
01:33:30 That's so fucking funny.
01:33:32 Amazing.
01:33:34 I love Pokemon now.
01:33:36 That's hilarious.
01:33:38 That's so stupid.
01:33:42 Oh, no, it's great.
01:33:44 The boulders in these pits.
01:33:48 Also a flat angled texture.
01:33:52 Games are just fake.
01:33:54 Games aren't real.
01:33:58 The artifice is disgusting.
01:34:02 They tricked me.
01:34:03 No, I like it.
01:34:05 Because it makes me feel like this is like a little paper.
01:34:08 This is like a big...
01:34:10 You go sound someone's basement, they've made this in paper and cardboard.
01:34:14 Yeah.
01:34:15 And they got their tiny little Pokemon trainer walking through it.
01:34:18 It really does just feel like, yeah, they cut out little paper dolls.
01:34:22 Is there a Mega Man game in here?
01:34:24 Metroid Prime?
01:34:26 If there was, it would probably be on the PlayStation 2.
01:34:30 No.
01:34:32 No, I don't see anyone.
01:34:34 Dang.
01:34:35 No Mega Man 64.
01:34:37 Oh, that would be awesome.
01:34:39 Well, not 64.
01:34:41 Legends is better.
01:34:44 Sure, but like if it's not PlayStation, that's what the only other one would be.
01:34:48 Yeah, 64 would be acceptable.
01:34:53 Ah, well.
01:34:55 Honestly, those would be fun levels to zoom around in.
01:34:59 In no clip.
01:35:01 Get on it, no clipper.
01:35:03 Honestly, yeah.
01:35:05 It's a beloved game from a beloved franchise, so you're just missing out.
01:35:12 Oh, you can't see anything from down below.
01:35:16 Like most of the textures do not draw if you see them from below.
01:35:21 So if you go, it's kind of spooky if you go below it and look up at the map.
01:35:26 Oh, in the Pokemon?
01:35:27 Yeah.
01:35:28 Let me go back to that.
01:35:29 Here, I'll show you what it looks like.
01:35:31 This is what it looks like in, if you're a Diglet.
01:35:39 I thought you were going to say if you're Giratina.
01:35:42 This is what Giratina sees.
01:35:44 Is Giratina of the Void?
01:35:46 Yeah, he's in like the, um, what, he's in like, he lives in like the hell dimension.
01:35:54 Ah, hell.
01:35:55 Distortion world, distortion world.
01:35:59 Hmm.
01:36:01 This is fun.
01:36:02 This is a cool little thing.
01:36:06 Oh my God, I'm zooming around on grand level.
01:36:13 I really wonder what goes into something like this.
01:36:15 Cause like, it's, it, there's no way it's just as simple as getting the file.
01:36:21 You've got to do a lot of stuff to it to make it just work like this.
01:36:25 Like in a browser.
01:36:27 Oh, you mean into building this, this website?
01:36:30 Yeah.
01:36:31 Yeah.
01:36:32 Um, God, yeah.
01:36:35 Like imagine if it was easy, they would probably have like tons of things, but.
01:36:40 Yeah, I mean, you think they have to like, they must have to, they must have to like
01:36:49 build it from like, sort of from scratch, right?
01:36:53 They must have to like take the game parts and like, uh, yeah.
01:37:00 Or there must be some, maybe there's some kind of algorithm for like, reading the game files
01:37:06 to sort of like, generate a sort of basic like map shape and then maybe you might have
01:37:16 to go in and like manually apply textures or something.
01:37:20 Yeah.
01:37:21 It's cause it's like, not, not every game is exactly the same, even among the same console
01:37:27 of how they load in everything.
01:37:30 There's probably like juggling like emulating technology and their own thing.
01:37:36 There's probably tools that will get you like much of the way there that can like read the
01:37:40 data and sort of interpret it into like a level geometry.
01:37:43 But then you, there's probably a lot of like going through it manually and like checking
01:37:49 everything and like if, if something's texture didn't load, right?
01:37:52 You have to like manually replace it.
01:37:54 Oh shit.
01:37:55 I'm going to go to Halo.
01:37:56 I'm going to see if the Halo is, is, is, is real.
01:38:00 I'm going to see if Halo is real.
01:38:02 Big ring.
01:38:03 Yeah.
01:38:04 I've never played a Halo game.
01:38:06 Not even a little bit.
01:38:08 I mean, barely.
01:38:12 I remember playing the campaign on PC of the first Halo game and it was fun.
01:38:18 I liked the aliens.
01:38:19 I liked shooting them.
01:38:21 Yeah.
01:38:22 Well.
01:38:23 But multiplayer, I was never good and I went to a friend's house once and they were playing
01:38:27 multiplayer and I died over and over again.
01:38:29 They were laughing.
01:38:30 Yeah.
01:38:31 They have it.
01:38:32 They play it all the time.
01:38:33 And I'm like, okay, well, yeah, I'm just going to go back to my Game Boy over here.
01:38:39 Yeah.
01:38:40 I'm not, I'm not super good at first person shooters and I often found them kind of frustrating
01:38:45 because I would lose at them.
01:38:47 I know I loaded the wrong map.
01:38:50 I'm still, I'm still zooming around in, in Sinnoh.
01:38:53 It's for, it's pretty fun.
01:38:55 Link in the description, of course.
01:38:57 Everyone should be like swinging, flying around with us.
01:39:01 Yeah.
01:39:02 As they listen.
01:39:05 Hot tip.
01:39:06 Use the mouse wheel.
01:39:07 Pull up your mouse wheel and you will zoom faster using WASD.
01:39:11 What?
01:39:12 Mouse wheel adjusts your camera movement speed.
01:39:15 It's true.
01:39:16 That's fucked.
01:39:17 It's true.
01:39:18 Yeah.
01:39:19 It's fucked.
01:39:20 Yeah.
01:39:21 It's fucked.
01:39:22 How fucking, uh, I see the halo is merely a skybox.
01:39:28 No.
01:39:29 I've broken the illusion.
01:39:31 Is that on Xbox?
01:39:33 I don't know.
01:39:34 PC.
01:39:35 PC.
01:39:36 Oh no.
01:39:37 It's on experimental.
01:39:38 Right at the bottom.
01:39:39 Hmm.
01:39:40 Halo.
01:39:41 Wait.
01:39:42 Oh, there.
01:39:44 Why, these are not in, uh, these are not in, in order.
01:39:48 Uh, what'd you mean?
01:39:50 I mean, why is halo at the bottom of, why are they not in alphabet, they're not in alphabetical
01:39:57 order.
01:39:58 What the hell?
01:39:59 What is the, what map are you looking at in halo?
01:40:03 Blood Gulch.
01:40:04 Campaign halo.
01:40:05 This is the first level of, when you land on the halo and you get out and you're like,
01:40:10 oh shit, aliens, get him.
01:40:13 Campaign.
01:40:14 Oh yeah.
01:40:15 I'm tired.
01:40:16 Oh yeah?
01:40:17 Yeah.
01:40:18 Well, I'm Gibb and take.
01:40:20 I had to wake up a little earlier than I wanted to today.
01:40:34 Do you have any idea what that's like?
01:40:37 Yes.
01:40:38 No, you don't.
01:40:41 If I had my way, I would wake up when I'm asleep.
01:40:46 Never.
01:40:47 Never.
01:40:48 You should watch some John Boyce document.
01:40:52 I remember trying to read.
01:40:54 They're so good.
01:40:55 I remember trying to read 1770, 1776.
01:40:59 And I got like little ways into it and I was like, oh cool.
01:41:03 Yeah, I guess I'll read the rest of it later and I never did.
01:41:06 Yeah.
01:41:07 You know, I like 17776, but it is a bit of a, it's a bit of a tough read, I guess.
01:41:17 You kind of have to like really sort of focus.
01:41:23 And the premise was interesting, like a satellite that was just realizing that it was a satellite
01:41:30 communicating with something else that was like really far away.
01:41:35 Yeah, that sounds right.
01:41:36 There was some time stuff like, oh, it's been a long time or like transmissions take a long
01:41:42 time to travel or something.
01:41:45 But then they were talking about baseball and then I died.
01:41:48 You mean football?
01:41:50 Football.
01:41:51 Yeah.
01:41:52 It was one of those spherical games.
01:41:55 For, okay.
01:41:56 Well, I mean a football, an American football is not.
01:41:59 It's not even a sphere.
01:42:00 It is oblong, but you know.
01:42:02 See, that's why I much I know.
01:42:04 Yeah.
01:42:07 What's a, what's a good one?
01:42:08 A good, good John.
01:42:09 Okay.
01:42:10 I mean, it's kind of a long series, but the series about the Atlanta Falcons is pretty
01:42:14 good.
01:42:15 That one's pretty fun.
01:42:16 Interesting.
01:42:18 What's, what's, what's like a short-ish one?
01:42:21 Just like a one-off.
01:42:22 That's really good.
01:42:23 Oh, it's another series, but the story, the story of Dave Steeb is really good.
01:42:31 The story of Dave Steeb was like, I saw a list of like best video essays of like the year
01:42:37 and yeah, the series about Dave Steeb made it on that list.
01:42:41 I think it was a Kotaku list.
01:42:43 There were a couple other videos on that list that I wanted to check out.
01:42:46 There was one where like a guy is giving like a live tour of like a real world bridge, but
01:42:54 he's doing it like in Battlegrounds 3 and like the people he's giving the tour to are like
01:43:01 these other players in like Battlegrounds and they're just like fricking World War 2 soldiers
01:43:05 or whatever.
01:43:06 And he's just leaving them around.
01:43:09 Or maybe not Battlegrounds.
01:43:11 Some armor.
01:43:13 Some war game.
01:43:15 Some like some World War, it might have been a World War 1 game actually.
01:43:19 But he's just leading them around this map in the game and like giving them real world
01:43:23 information about this bridge that has been recreated.
01:43:27 You know what?
01:43:28 Let me, you know what?
01:43:29 Let me just find that video because I didn't get all the way through it.
01:43:32 But I started it and I was like, what the fuck is this?
01:43:38 Like why?
01:43:41 I kind of meant to get further through it because like maybe there would be a point
01:43:45 and I'd go, oh, I see why this exists.
01:43:50 But I like the video or like the bridge.
01:43:53 The video.
01:43:55 Maybe it's just like you want to know some history.
01:43:59 I got a virtual tour.
01:44:00 I got to be honest.
01:44:01 I didn't really, I didn't immediately understand why I should care about this bridge.
01:44:09 Here's the video.
01:44:10 It's on Vimeo of all things.
01:44:15 Actually, you know what?
01:44:17 Here's the, here's that list that I found.
01:44:19 No, it's not Kotaku.
01:44:20 It's Polygon.
01:44:21 These are like 10, 10 video essays.
01:44:28 And yeah, one of them was a John Boyce.
01:44:31 The Captain Ahab, the story of Dave Steeb by Secret Base is on there.
01:44:35 So they must have somewhat decent taste.
01:44:41 Oh, and then they have a Jacob Geller on here and I'm on the record.
01:44:44 I don't like Jacob Geller.
01:44:49 I'm on the record.
01:44:50 I'll put it out there.
01:44:53 The 10 best video essays of 2022.
01:44:57 What a pathetic theme for an article.
01:45:02 You say, I mean, you say that and yet, and yet, I mean, looking through the list, I
01:45:07 was not familiar with most of these channels.
01:45:09 And so I thought maybe, and so I thought maybe I should give them a chance.
01:45:13 I find, even though it's like hypocritical of me, I find the idea of caring about like
01:45:21 video essays like dumb, they dumb.
01:45:27 It's nice and I like them.
01:45:29 So it's really just, it's just like a weird snobby thing I have.
01:45:33 I don't care about them as a medium, but I mean, I don't know if I would even describe
01:45:42 the story of Dave Steeb as an essay.
01:45:45 It's sort of, it's sort of an essay.
01:45:47 It's sort of a documentary, but it's, um, yeah.
01:45:54 I mean, I guess I wouldn't, you couldn't, I wouldn't say you can't call it an essay.
01:45:58 It is one, but there's more to it than, than just that.
01:46:05 And I mean, this, um, deconstructing the bridge seems like it's more of like a lecture than
01:46:11 an essay.
01:46:14 Oh yeah.
01:46:19 University level lecture.
01:46:21 What makes an essay?
01:46:23 Exactly.
01:46:25 I mean, it really just comes down to like, it is a video presentation with probably a
01:46:33 question at the beginning and explanations with evidence or something.
01:46:38 I guess, I guess all it really takes to be an essay is just that like you wrote it and
01:46:43 it's like written.
01:46:45 Yeah.
01:46:46 Yeah.
01:46:47 Like it's meant to convey musings on a point.
01:46:52 And the good essay has a good interesting question that you want to know.
01:46:56 That's why I feel like view source videos are the best video essays because they're like,
01:47:00 I like that.
01:47:01 He's good at speaking and he has nice questions.
01:47:05 Like I don't really give a shit about, uh, a bridge even if it may make me feel smart
01:47:12 to know about it.
01:47:15 Maybe there's a, maybe there's a, what does it say?
01:47:19 Yeah.
01:47:20 It's more of a university level lecture set in the least academic form imagine a session
01:47:24 of battlefield five, uh, within the battlefield five map is a recreation of Dutch city of
01:47:30 Nijmegen, Nijmegen, the site of a decisive battle during World War two.
01:47:36 Total refusal takes viewers on a survey of the area in virtual form and in the process
01:47:40 they delve not just into the history involved, but also the entire concept of war, tourism
01:47:44 and recreations questioning how culture remembers these events.
01:47:48 Maybe it goes somewhere.
01:47:51 Yeah.
01:47:52 I could take or leave a thoughtful topic essay on something.
01:48:00 What do you mean?
01:48:01 I don't find them, like I don't find them to be something I need to spend my time finding
01:48:06 and watching as opposed to like, oh, there's all these cool shows and films and games.
01:48:12 Like I feel like I should get around to those things.
01:48:14 But like video essays are like, hmm.
01:48:17 Yeah.
01:48:18 Sure.
01:48:19 They're a good ones.
01:48:22 Yeah, it's reasonable.
01:48:24 What is it?
01:48:25 What does it say about me?
01:48:26 What does it say about me that I might be more drawn to a medium about discussing things
01:48:36 than I am drawn to actually like watch or experience the things themselves.
01:48:42 Because I hate shows and I hate art.
01:48:45 I think it's not a bad thing to enjoy a video essay.
01:48:51 Like to have, I mean, it's just sort of, it's a more direct than an art piece.
01:48:59 And art pieces like could be anything.
01:49:03 You're to be entertained usually and feelings are elicited.
01:49:08 Like an essay sets out with a goal.
01:49:11 Here's a question and we're going to try and we're going to figure this shit out.
01:49:15 And you're going to learn about it.
01:49:17 And I'm like, well, okay, I can, I can, I'll learn about that.
01:49:21 Yes.
01:49:22 I know exactly what I'm going to get out of this.
01:49:25 And so it's easier to approach maybe.
01:49:27 There must be something wrong with me.
01:49:30 It's just a matter of finding out what.
01:49:33 I mean, I don't watch too much stuff either.
01:49:36 I only watch things that are like everyone's saying, you got to, you got to watch it.
01:49:40 Yeah.
01:49:41 Like eventually I do.
01:49:43 And I'm like, okay, that was good.
01:49:45 I guess, I guess I'm the same way.
01:49:47 It's like, if I, if enough people recommend me, like Ben, you got to watch this thing.
01:49:52 You got to play this thing.
01:49:53 If enough people tell me that, then I'll, then I'll do it.
01:49:57 Oh, speaking of hypocriticalness, the, I finished medical soil and immediately I went for video
01:50:08 essays or like episode analysis of various things.
01:50:13 And I found this guy truly logical.
01:50:16 A logical has really good, like on a higher level than like your generic, like, here's
01:50:23 what we know about this scene.
01:50:25 Yeah.
01:50:26 Like it.
01:50:27 He's, he's a little more clued in.
01:50:29 You can tell he is a little more of a smarty pants about like themes and use of color to
01:50:37 denote theme and stuff.
01:50:40 And, you know, use of shots.
01:50:43 He spends a long time.
01:50:44 Misunseen.
01:50:46 Yeah.
01:50:47 Whatever that you said.
01:50:48 Yeah.
01:50:49 Yeah.
01:50:51 He spends a long time going over certain shots and the usage of those shots and why and the
01:50:57 character bits and is like, ah, yeah, you know, that's why beyond what I would have
01:51:02 brought out of it, but just watching it.
01:51:05 But now that I know the story, I can really appreciate those added details.
01:51:09 And there are some things I did have questions on.
01:51:12 Like some scenes are just a little, a little obtuse.
01:51:19 He breaks them down.
01:51:20 I'm like, oh, yeah, that's so smart that it, it does the thing.
01:51:26 And I get it.
01:51:28 Now I'm smart.
01:51:29 And that's why I like videos.
01:51:31 Very good.
01:51:32 Very good.
01:51:34 His name is all logical.
01:51:36 All logical with an O at the beginning.
01:51:39 The two L's.
01:51:41 Oh, no.
01:51:42 One L.
01:51:43 Let me just get a random, a random one.
01:51:47 Hmm.
01:51:48 What does the blue flower mean?
01:51:49 Oh my God.
01:51:50 It's a Game of Thrones reference.
01:51:52 Yeah.
01:51:53 It's so, so good.
01:51:56 That's a spoiler for you though.
01:51:59 You shouldn't click on that.
01:52:00 I probably shouldn't click on it.
01:52:01 I should watch better.
01:52:03 I mean, I've watched all of Breaking Bad and most of Better Call Saul, I think.
01:52:08 So I should probably finish it at some point.
01:52:11 Yeah.
01:52:12 I mean, I do like Bob.
01:52:16 Who doesn't like Bob?
01:52:18 Oh yeah.
01:52:19 Everyone loves Bob.
01:52:20 And then the best thing about finishing a show, especially a really good dramatic show,
01:52:24 is that now you can watch all the bloopers without being spoiled.
01:52:28 And you can see the characters that have been so expertly played.
01:52:34 Be a little silly.
01:52:36 Be a little silly.
01:52:37 Finally.
01:52:38 You see Gus going, wah!
01:52:41 Gus Fring going, woohoo!
01:52:43 And jumping like Mario.
01:52:46 Perfect.
01:52:48 That's just what I want.
01:52:51 That's the only reason you should watch any show, is so you can get invested in a serious character
01:52:55 and then you can see them be a real person in an interview.
01:52:57 You're going to build them up so you can break them down and watch them go, ha ha ha ha.
01:53:01 Ha ha ha.
01:53:02 Oh, Jollity and Gaity.
01:53:04 How I missed you.
01:53:05 You slap your head off the forehead and go, oh my God, they were just acting this whole time.
01:53:12 I love that.
01:53:14 Yeah.
01:53:15 Jonathan Banks.
01:53:16 What a sweetie pie.
01:53:17 What a cutie pie.
01:53:18 But in the show.
01:53:19 Jonathan Banks.
01:53:20 Who's that?
01:53:21 Mike Herman Trout.
01:53:22 Oh yeah.
01:53:23 And so he's like, he's a grizzled, like I listen here, Walter.
01:53:27 You're going to take your pants off and you're going to piss right on my face, Walter.
01:53:33 Like that's what he says in the show.
01:53:34 But in reality.
01:53:35 It's the only way to get the poise now.
01:53:36 I got stung by a jellyfish, Walter.
01:53:38 You got to pee on it.
01:53:39 Pea on it, Walter.
01:53:42 And in real life, he's a nice, he's a nice boy.
01:53:46 He doesn't want to get peed on in real life.
01:53:49 Oh, good.
01:53:50 What a relief.
01:53:52 You see, when we were filming that scene, I didn't want piss on me because I don't actually
01:53:58 like that.
01:53:59 But I thought, but I thought, you know, I was going to do it for the part.
01:54:01 But I thought, you know, the, you know, Mike, the character, you know, I thought he would
01:54:05 probably want to get pissed on because like, you know, that's what it would take to like
01:54:09 keep his daughter safe and like his grandson safe.
01:54:12 So he would say piss on me.
01:54:14 So that's what I said in that scene because I was playing the character you see.
01:54:20 He would need to be pissed on.
01:54:22 You see, there's this thing called acting.
01:54:24 You see, it's like playing pretend, but on a, with camera, they film you.
01:54:30 Put it on TV.
01:54:34 It's wild.
01:54:37 My impression of him is morphing into a Sylvester Stallone.
01:54:42 I'm trying to think of, did I, did I, did I experience anything else this week?
01:54:47 No.
01:54:48 Did you have feelings?
01:54:49 Did you have touch and sound the site smell?
01:54:53 I felt depression, despair, despondency, the three D's.
01:54:59 Nuts.
01:55:05 Devastation, disenfranchisement, denouement.
01:55:12 Denouement.
01:55:13 Yeah.
01:55:14 Is that like a, like a French thing, like meaning the end?
01:55:18 Yeah.
01:55:19 Oh no.
01:55:20 The French, the French are ending.
01:55:25 Um.
01:55:27 But they made so much good bread.
01:55:30 Yeah, well, it wasn't enough, unfortunately.
01:55:35 Oh, um, I think tomorrow, I think tomorrow I'll be able to restore, add, add revenue functionality to the channel.
01:55:46 Or if not, or if not tomorrow, shortly thereafter, the nightmare.
01:55:52 The nightmare is almost over.
01:55:56 Um, Lamal, sorry about that.
01:56:01 Uh, it's okay.
01:56:02 Yeah, it was a mistake that I made and I won't make it again.
01:56:07 Cost us like 150 bucks, but I got probably at the 80 bucks out of the, of the account.
01:56:14 So, you know, costs like 90, like seven bucks.
01:56:21 Sorry.
01:56:24 It's all coming out of your.
01:56:25 It's all, it's all coming out of your.
01:56:31 Uh, I don't know.
01:56:33 This week felt really long.
01:56:34 This week felt really long and yet I can't remember anything that happened.
01:56:40 God.
01:56:41 There's a thing with the Scottish parliament trying to get.
01:56:47 God.
01:56:48 Trying to get that gender reform, gender bill through.
01:56:53 And that's good, right?
01:56:55 Scotland is the good guys.
01:56:57 Yes.
01:56:58 They want, they, they realize that the, um, the way to get gender help in, you know, the UK is evil and distressing on purpose.
01:57:12 Yeah.
01:57:13 And, uh, it's, uh, bad.
01:57:15 So they're going, they want to change it.
01:57:17 They want to make it easier.
01:57:18 They want to remove the requirement, uh, for a doctor's note, uh, to determine that you are trans.
01:57:25 You can now self-identify or at least that's what they want.
01:57:28 Was it, was it the thing where like to be like legally change your gender, you have to have like a doctor's note, but like the doctor won't like acknowledge it unless you've already been on hormones for like two years.
01:57:41 But to get on hormones, you have to have a doctor's note saying that you're trans, but the doctor won't say that unless you've been on hormones.
01:57:48 It's not like a criss-cross thing like that.
01:57:51 It's, um, if you want to get on hormones, you need, uh, to be certified trans by a board of people who determine whether you're not you're trans, uh, by interviewing you.
01:58:07 And the waiting, the wait for the interview, uh, takes usually two years, um, sometimes longer.
01:58:17 And it's clear they just don't put the money in to staff it correctly.
01:58:22 They have thousands upon thousands of people waiting.
01:58:24 And so the queue is extremely long.
01:58:26 And the people in there don't seem to give a shit.
01:58:30 And they're horrible and demeaning from, you know, stories I've heard.
01:58:36 And they just, you know, it's very clear that the system doesn't like trans people at all.
01:58:43 What's nothing to do with them.
01:58:45 So what's the Scottish legislation?
01:58:48 They want to cut out all of that bullshit to get a gender recognition certificate.
01:58:53 They just want, they want it to be.
01:58:55 Like in Scotland or would it apply to the UK generally?
01:58:59 It would apply to Scotland, as far as I understand.
01:59:03 But the UK is, was concerned that people would go to Scotland to get a gender recognition certificate.
01:59:12 It can be easier to get one, like to be able to change their gender for stuff and then come back to the UK.
01:59:21 And they'd be like, nah, we can't have this allowed thing.
01:59:27 We can't allow it to happen because it'd be confusing because we won't do that.
01:59:32 We won't recognize that as a legitimate thing.
01:59:37 So like if you're a Scottish national and you get your gender changed and you go to the UK,
01:59:43 they will not recognize it if that were to go through.
01:59:46 So they said, no, we're just going to block it entirely.
01:59:49 And now Scotland is going to have to go to court to fight it.
01:59:54 And it looks like they want to.
01:59:57 And it's a big sort of like thing.
02:00:01 I'm wondering what's going to happen.
02:00:03 I've seen JK Rowling has been like, she seems agitated.
02:00:09 She seems agitated about it.
02:00:11 And the way that you can tell that she's agitated is she's like gone.
02:00:16 The last couple of days, I think she's been like even more so than usual.
02:00:20 Retweeting people with like a thousand followers being like this person wants to commit violence against women.
02:00:26 This person wants to kill women.
02:00:29 Yeah, it's great.
02:00:31 She's a real ghoul.
02:00:33 She's a real demon woman.
02:00:36 It's pretty sick.
02:00:40 And I know she has her claws in the BBC.
02:00:44 I know she has her tendrils all over that place.
02:00:47 BBC is like sort of consistently painting the Scottish Parliament and what's her name?
02:00:57 The important lady at the front of the top of it.
02:01:00 Is it Nicola Sturgeon?
02:01:02 Can't remember.
02:01:03 That's a lady.
02:01:05 Like the leader of the Scottish Parliament.
02:01:08 Nicola?
02:01:11 Nicola.
02:01:13 Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland.
02:01:17 Like if Scotland had a prime minister, she would be it basically.
02:01:21 I see, yeah.
02:01:24 Are they going to do separatism?
02:01:26 Are they going to do a secede from the Union?
02:01:28 Is it going to be civil war?
02:01:30 They have wanted to.
02:01:32 Scotland has wanted to be allowed a vote to leave the UK because for such a long time,
02:01:41 they always vote for a left-leaning, good, nice human person stuff.
02:01:48 I did not know that about Scotland.
02:01:51 No, they're cool people up there.
02:01:54 They vote left-leaning.
02:01:56 They're more labour, far more labour than conservative.
02:02:00 And they just want to leave because every election, the majority is always conservative because there are more English people
02:02:08 and most English people are conservative.
02:02:10 I kind of thought Northern UK was more conservative and Southern England was the more urban, liberal centre.
02:02:19 It's actually not so much.
02:02:21 Urban is generally more liberal, but there are lots of urban areas that are extremely exclusive,
02:02:30 upper-class, super-white areas as well.
02:02:34 Ancient areas that only extremely wealthy people and really snobby people go to.
02:02:41 So it's not like the urban environment is integrated smoothly through all the places.
02:02:47 So there are pockets of left-leaning stuff in London and stuff, but there's a lot of conservatives in the South
02:02:55 as well as some parts of the North.
02:02:58 The North has historically been more left-leaning, more labour, worker-focused.
02:03:03 I see.
02:03:04 In America, you look at maps of which districts voted for which presidential candidates.
02:03:12 There are blue states and red states, but if you actually look at it by district,
02:03:18 the blue centres are always clustered around the major cities and the red districts are outside of the major cities.
02:03:28 Blue states are just states that have a bigger urban population,
02:03:32 and 90% of the time that's how it breaks down.
02:03:35 That's the real split.
02:03:37 I would say that's the same in the UK.
02:03:42 It's not like city areas, just adjacent to cities that have lots of mansions in them
02:03:51 and big suburban, rich suburbs, but big house suburbs near London and around London, some in London.
02:04:04 I think I understand.
02:04:06 It's a little bit of this and that, but Scotland has always been not happy with things like Brexit
02:04:14 and other various conservative decisions that are awful and terrible.
02:04:21 This seems to be a linchpin moment.
02:04:27 It seems to be a turning point where if they go to court against the UK,
02:04:36 it could set things in motion for another attempt at seceding from the kingdom.
02:04:42 That'd be so fucking funny.
02:04:44 It would be funny, and honestly, I want that for them because I hate the UK.
02:04:50 The UK, the England part, it sucks.
02:04:54 I mean, frankly, your people need to be punished for their transgressions.
02:05:02 They need to suffer some consequences.
02:05:04 They fucking voted for Brexit, and they're just generally idiots, and I hate them.
02:05:10 If Scotland manages to secede, I'd move.
02:05:15 I'd go to Scotland.
02:05:16 I know it'd be probably difficult because it's moving to a different country is always difficult.
02:05:21 Like, fuck it.
02:05:22 Maybe you should move now before they break officially.
02:05:26 Maybe you could move before they officially announced they had actually left.
02:05:32 I could try.
02:05:34 But then probably once they split, they probably would need new paperwork or something.
02:05:39 You'd be like, you haven't lived in Scotland for that long.
02:05:42 It'd be suddenly like, oh, you're here, but you're a UK citizen,
02:05:46 so now you're going to need a visa or something like that.
02:05:49 Yes, it's always going to be a thing.
02:05:52 But if Scotland secedes and they're their own nation, they'll probably join the European Union,
02:06:00 and they'll be so embarrassing for England.
02:06:05 They will have gender thing, and I'm like, fuck it.
02:06:10 I'm gone.
02:06:11 I'm going to be Scottish now.
02:06:13 Damn.
02:06:14 Yeah.
02:06:15 That's pretty wild if it shakes out like that.
02:06:19 It'll be pretty fucking wild.
02:06:21 And then the Union flag will have no blue in it.
02:06:25 It'll be red and white.
02:06:27 Would you think they'd change the flag?
02:06:30 Because it's the symbol of the countries that are involved.
02:06:34 So, yeah.
02:06:35 Yeah.
02:06:36 Oh, my God.
02:06:37 I mean, I guess, yeah, if Texas seceded from America,
02:06:41 I guess we'd need a new flag with 49 stars on it.
02:06:45 So, LeMalle.
02:06:49 And then it would be so much less cool of a color scheme.
02:06:53 So it would just be the big middle cross and the red X behind it.
02:06:59 It would be the big middle cross with the white outline and then the diagonal X,
02:07:04 the red X with the white outline.
02:07:07 I guess it would just be white.
02:07:09 So it would just be red Xs.
02:07:11 It would just be a red cross and a superimposed on a red X.
02:07:15 Uh-huh.
02:07:16 Hang on, hang on.
02:07:17 I wonder if someone's mocked this up.
02:07:19 UK flag without Scotland.
02:07:22 Oh, my God.
02:07:26 Well, someone has this one, and I think this one includes like whales,
02:07:31 which like whales is like not represented on the flag currently.
02:07:35 No.
02:07:37 I don't know why.
02:07:39 Yeah.
02:07:40 I never really thought about it though.
02:07:42 Because I always assume, you know what?
02:07:45 I don't know what the diagonal X cross is for.
02:07:49 I remember learning about it once.
02:07:51 I know the horizontal big cross in the middle is England
02:07:56 and the blue is Scotland.
02:07:58 Gee, I just don't know what that other one is.
02:08:01 Oh, that one, that second one sucks.
02:08:04 Yeah, they should, it needs the white bars.
02:08:08 It needs the white bars and breaking up the, I mean, here's one that's kind of...
02:08:15 No.
02:08:16 Oh, dear.
02:08:17 I think the first one just without the green is probably the best.
02:08:23 Okay, now I'm curious.
02:08:27 Okay, the Union Jack is the flag and...
02:08:33 Oh, my God, it's complicated.
02:08:36 Fuck.
02:08:37 Vexillology is complicated.
02:08:40 Okay, the flag consists of the Red Cross of St George,
02:08:44 Patron State of England, which also represents whales,
02:08:47 aged in white, superimposed on the salt here of St Patrick, Patron State of Ireland.
02:08:52 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
02:08:53 Oh, St...
02:08:54 Oh, so it's the Irish part.
02:08:56 So if Northern Ireland leaves, then you would get rid of the diagonal.
02:09:00 Oh.
02:09:01 If Northern Ireland goes back to becoming part of Ireland, then that part would leave
02:09:06 and then it would just be England.
02:09:08 There'd be no kingdom, except Wales, I guess.
02:09:12 Wales is the only one left.
02:09:16 And then it would just be, it would just be, yeah, the Red Cross of England,
02:09:21 but like the bottom two quarters would just be green.
02:09:25 I think the Union Jack came together pretty well in its current state.
02:09:29 I think it looks pretty good.
02:09:31 Yeah, it's three different saints.
02:09:32 St George, St Patrick and St Andrew.
02:09:35 See, look at this.
02:09:37 Wales is not represented in the Union flag by Wales as Patron St David,
02:09:40 because the flag was designed whilst Wales was part of the Kingdom of England.
02:09:44 Wait, it's not, their patron saint isn't St George,
02:09:47 even though they have a freaking dragon on their flag?
02:09:49 No, that's the English one.
02:09:51 St George is like a saint who slayed a dragon and Wales is a guy they like.
02:09:56 They is the dragon.
02:09:57 Oh, fuck.
02:10:00 Your dragon can't be on our flag.
02:10:02 We killed your guy.
02:10:04 That might literally be it.
02:10:07 Here's a suggestion.
02:10:09 Slay the dragon could mean like, oh, we took over this kingdom
02:10:14 and this is the flag we both fly under now.
02:10:17 That's hilarious.
02:10:19 Cucked.
02:10:20 Wales cucked.
02:10:23 Wales, you know, if the dragon was more prominent, it'd be even cooler, I think.
02:10:28 Wales should be the important one.
02:10:30 I have mixed feelings about the dragon.
02:10:32 On the one hand, the dragon is cool and like the old school like design of it is cool.
02:10:38 But also, I kind of feel like busy drawings are kind of weak flag design.
02:10:46 I think that I think they're not very iconic.
02:10:50 I think the Welsh flag is I think the best way that sort of a type of flag has been
02:10:58 because it is iconic.
02:10:59 It's only got a few colors.
02:11:01 Yeah.
02:11:02 And it's like unique in that it has an animal.
02:11:05 It has a depiction of a creature.
02:11:08 No, you're, yeah, you're kind of right.
02:11:11 You're kind of like for that type, I think it's good.
02:11:16 Generally, I feel like if you can if you can have a strong and iconic flag design without
02:11:22 just like fucking draw in a thing on it, I think it's better.
02:11:27 I agree.
02:11:28 But I think the fact that most other flags don't have a dragon or some sort of elaborate
02:11:33 creature on it means that it is allowed to stand out in a way that that is like not because
02:11:39 if everybody drew stuff, it would be very confusing.
02:11:41 The fact that it's the only one means that it's good and it's fine.
02:11:45 I, yeah, I agree.
02:11:48 I agree.
02:11:49 Have I showed you the Massachusetts flag?
02:11:52 I've probably seen it before, but no.
02:11:54 It sucks.
02:11:55 It's dog shit.
02:12:00 I know the New Mexico flag because they show it in medical soul a few times.
02:12:05 The, or wait a minute.
02:12:06 Yeah, it's the the the Massachusetts flag is this weird like shield with a Native American
02:12:14 like brave on it and then the freaking like sword arm.
02:12:20 I don't know if it's meant to crest.
02:12:22 I don't know if it's meant to be like, yeah, we freaking like killed these guys, but it
02:12:26 kind of looks like, yeah, we freaking conquered these dudes.
02:12:29 I think it's actually not meant to mean that, but the sword over them is really grim.
02:12:34 Yeah, like he's about to swing around, chop his head off.
02:12:37 That's what it looks like.
02:12:38 Yeah, that's what it looks like.
02:12:40 There's some like Latin, some Latin phrase or whatever.
02:12:45 This is the sort of thing you would put on like an official document, not like a flag.
02:12:49 I think it's, it's, it's a, this is a crest.
02:12:52 This is not a flag.
02:12:53 No, of course.
02:12:54 Yeah.
02:12:55 But if it counts as the flag of the state.
02:12:59 This, this is the official.
02:13:02 Wall flag of Massachusetts.
02:13:04 Although there is also a.
02:13:09 Yeah, the New Mexico flag is great.
02:13:12 I really like the Maryland flag a lot.
02:13:16 What's the New Mexico flag?
02:13:17 That's like, yeah, that one's pretty good.
02:13:20 It's like the sun because it's hot.
02:13:24 And it's yellow.
02:13:25 It looks like it looks like one of those Japanese like district flags.
02:13:29 Yes.
02:13:31 The you, you have probably seen this because it was flying everywhere at Brony con, but
02:13:37 the Maryland flag is like this.
02:13:41 Oh, and it's a little busy, but like it's really striking.
02:13:44 I think it looks awesome.
02:13:46 Yeah.
02:13:47 The black and yellow makes me think of driver, the video game series.
02:13:53 Crazy taxi.
02:13:56 But the white and red part is like medieval looking.
02:14:00 Yeah.
02:14:01 For sure.
02:14:02 Like nights on bikes.
02:14:07 By jousting on.
02:14:10 Yeah.
02:14:11 I'm trying to.
02:14:14 I'm trying to read up on like why what is like the the symbolism of the
02:14:19 Massachusetts flag meant to represent.
02:14:22 Yeah, we killed all those natives.
02:14:24 The shield is meant to depict an Algonquin native American with bow and arrow.
02:14:28 The arrow is pointed downward signifying peace.
02:14:31 However, the face of the figure is modeled on a photo of Ojibwe chief Thomas little shell.
02:14:36 A white star with five points appears next to the figure's head signifying Massachusetts as a U.S.
02:14:41 state.
02:14:42 Okay.
02:14:43 I mean, it's not like any of the other state flags have a little white star to be like, yeah,
02:14:48 we're one of the stars on the American flag.
02:14:50 Yeah.
02:14:52 A blue ribbon surrounds the shield bearing the state motto.
02:15:05 This is weird.
02:15:06 Above the shield is the state military crest, the bent arm holding a broad sword aloft.
02:15:11 The sword has its blade up to remind that it was through the American Revolution that Liberty was one.
02:15:18 The sword itself is the copy of one belonging to Miles Standish and signifies the philosophy
02:15:23 that one would rather lose their right arm than live under tyranny.
02:15:26 Holy shit.
02:15:28 Pretty cool.
02:15:29 Kind of cool, but there's like a lot of just a lot going on.
02:15:35 Just a lot freaking going on.
02:15:38 What if you did a cosplay as the flag?
02:15:43 I like that would be racist.
02:15:45 No, you dress up as a shield with a blue ribbon around it and you wear it like you have your
02:15:50 hand like holding a sword above your head the whole time.
02:15:56 And you've got a white sheet on underneath.
02:15:59 Sounds a little, I don't know.
02:16:03 I don't know if the message would come across.
02:16:07 Yeah, I mean, I guess the Indian is just there to just be like, yeah, these guys lived here.
02:16:14 It's like, OK.
02:16:16 Chief Thomas Little Shell.
02:16:18 I wonder what his deal was.
02:16:21 Do we like him?
02:16:22 Do we stand Thomas Little Shell?
02:16:25 Let's find out.
02:16:26 Yeah.
02:16:29 Chief of a band of the Ojibwa Chippewa tribe in the second half of the 19th century.
02:16:36 Little Shell attempted to sell his remaining lands for $1 per acre and be allowed to have at least
02:16:41 10 million acres of remaining lands in Montana.
02:16:45 OK, it seems like he refused to negotiate with the United States about seeding more land for
02:16:51 almost another 30 years.
02:16:52 Little Shell refused to negotiate with the United States over land.
02:16:55 Together the Anishinabeg occupied an area.
02:17:01 I mean, OK.
02:17:03 He seems like just he was chief of the tribe at that time and we had relations with him, some amicable and some not.
02:17:19 So neutral, I guess.
02:17:22 So we put his likeness on a shield.
02:17:24 So we put his likeness on a state shield maybe to be like, we respect those guys?
02:17:32 I guess.
02:17:33 I guess you had to be there.
02:17:37 At the time, it made perfect sense at the time.
02:17:41 Yeah.
02:17:44 Yeah, seems like it's...
02:17:46 I think people...
02:17:49 I think there's been a bit of a movement to change the flag, but I don't know if it's like that big of one.
02:17:59 You know, I think some people say that it's a bit of like a, you know, the Washington Redskins situation, but there's a little antiquated.
02:18:07 Yeah, but I don't know if there's like that.
02:18:09 But I just kind of think it's just kind of think it's ugly.
02:18:12 I think it's an ugly flag design.
02:18:15 I'm not sure if I think it's like bad representation or appropriation or whatever.
02:18:21 What would you, what would you as a Massachusetts, what would you have on your flag?
02:18:26 God, I'm the wrong person to ask.
02:18:32 There is like another...
02:18:35 Okay, well, there's a there's a Massachusetts naval ensign that just looks like this.
02:18:41 I don't know if I am super into it.
02:18:44 It's a tree.
02:18:45 Just a pine tree.
02:18:47 Yeah.
02:18:48 We got those all over the place.
02:18:51 There's also, yeah, that was like, well, that was like when we had a state Navy and we don't.
02:19:01 Ooh, the Massachusetts state flag, according to a survey, was the 38th, ranked 38th best flag in America.
02:19:11 So not very, not very high.
02:19:15 Oh, 38th out of 72, which included US state, US territorial and Canadian provincial flags.
02:19:21 So it's mid, it's mid.
02:19:24 I guess it can get worse.
02:19:25 What's that like extremely embarrassing one that looks like Microsoft Paint with like the trees in the river?
02:19:32 Yeah, that wasn't, I don't think that was a state flag.
02:19:35 I think that was like, I know the one you're talking about.
02:19:38 Really bad flag Google.
02:19:41 Immediately.
02:19:44 River G County, Liberia.
02:19:47 Actually, if I can see a picture of the Liberian flag, like a photograph of it in real life.
02:19:52 Oh, no.
02:19:53 No, they only show the, the star and bar part of it.
02:19:58 I'm, I'm learning so much.
02:20:01 Okay.
02:20:02 So, okay.
02:20:04 So there's a flag called the English Red Ensign, which is the civil ensign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain.
02:20:13 And Northern Ireland, it is one of the British ensigns.
02:20:17 What does that mean?
02:20:18 What is a, in British maritime law and custom and ensign is the identifying flag flown to designate a British ship.
02:20:25 Okay.
02:20:26 So.
02:20:27 Just the Liberian G County.
02:20:29 God, what the fuck?
02:20:32 That's not, that's not the one I was thinking of.
02:20:36 It's the one I was thinking of.
02:20:39 Well, there's that one that has like, it has like a freaking like gradient on it.
02:20:44 Yeah, I don't know that one.
02:20:45 Wait, is this?
02:20:46 I'm going to search shitty flags.
02:20:49 There's like, there's, there's versions of this flag.
02:20:54 Some of these are not that bad.
02:20:55 This Liberian flag.
02:20:57 They just look like someone else drew it.
02:20:59 But like, which one is the actual one?
02:21:01 Is it that one?
02:21:02 Oh, this is, I found a list.
02:21:05 I found a list of shitty flags and like, this is dog shit.
02:21:08 Some of these are like good, actually.
02:21:10 This is like, this is like a joke list.
02:21:12 This is garbage.
02:21:14 Okay.
02:21:15 The Liberian flag.
02:21:16 Yeah, I see that one.
02:21:18 What's the one that has the freaking gradient?
02:21:21 It has like a gradient and like a full sentence on it.
02:21:25 Oh, you know, I think I know that one, but yeah, I can't remember it either.
02:21:29 I think it was from somewhere in like Utah or.
02:21:34 It was like anim.
02:21:35 It was like, it was like a city flag.
02:21:38 I can't, I can't find it right away.
02:21:41 All right.
02:21:42 So, so, so check this out, right?
02:21:44 So this is, this is the red, the English red ensign, which you flew to designate that your ship was English.
02:21:52 And then to that, they added this freaking Massachusetts naval sign to make this was like the flag of New England.
02:22:04 They added the freaking Massachusetts tree on it.
02:22:08 So that's flying in the wind.
02:22:09 You can see the red, you see, okay, it's an ensign ship.
02:22:12 And then that tiny little bit of green right in the corner.
02:22:15 And then they, and then they took, they took off, I think this was post-revolution.
02:22:19 They took off the British ensign part and they just made it this and this, and this became the flag of New England.
02:22:26 And okay, look at this shit.
02:22:27 That looks like you had a PNG of a tree, but you didn't know how to cut around the white.
02:22:34 You didn't know how to cut out the white around the tree.
02:22:37 Oh my God.
02:22:38 Wait a second.
02:22:39 You're going to love this.
02:22:40 Okay.
02:22:41 This was, this is the, I'm about to show you the first flag adopted by the state of Massachusetts after independence.
02:22:47 And it's called the pine tree flag.
02:22:49 And it looks like this.
02:22:50 And it looks like this.
02:22:55 This, this really does look like MS paint.
02:22:57 That's so sad.
02:22:58 An appeal to heaven.
02:23:00 What are they asking for?
02:23:01 I, I don't, I don't quite get it.
02:23:04 Please put us out of our misery.
02:23:07 It's what it seems to be saying.
02:23:09 Please.
02:23:10 Yeah.
02:23:11 A simp emoji.
02:23:14 Heaven, please.
02:23:15 Heaven, please swallow us up.
02:23:18 And then, and then this one's a little better.
02:23:21 Reverse side of the flag of Massachusetts.
02:23:24 The reverse side looked like this.
02:23:27 It's a little better.
02:23:28 It's a little more iconic, but I really, I really don't like that green on blue.
02:23:33 It's very dull.
02:23:35 It is pretty dull.
02:23:36 I think an actual shield like that would be pretty cool, but on a flag, it's like, it's too small.
02:23:42 The colors are too similar to each other.
02:23:44 Yeah.
02:23:45 So I kind of appreciate what they were going for, but I don't know if this really, this one really does it for me.
02:23:52 Is that not symmetrical?
02:23:54 Yeah, it's not.
02:23:55 Yeah.
02:23:56 The tree is not quite symmetrical.
02:23:57 I noticed that too.
02:23:58 It's, it's so annoying to me that like.
02:24:01 Yeah.
02:24:02 Why wouldn't you just make it?
02:24:03 It's not just that it's not symmetrical, but like the top of it seems more jagged and flat.
02:24:08 And then that one part in the bottom left is like really loosey-goosey.
02:24:11 Squeeze.
02:24:12 Yeah.
02:24:14 Yeah.
02:24:15 I, I, I don't understand.
02:24:19 I don't.
02:24:20 This is why they need us up on that crew.
02:24:24 Everybody needs an us up.
02:24:27 If you, if you can, when you get right down to it.
02:24:31 Well, that's a, I like flags.
02:24:33 I like symbols.
02:24:35 Yeah.
02:24:36 And signs.
02:24:37 We should have a flag.
02:24:38 We should have a PCP flag.
02:24:41 Hmm.
02:24:44 The letters PCP drawn and quartered.
02:24:48 No.
02:24:52 Apparently, you know how they, they put the tree, they put the tree in the little window there.
02:24:58 Apparently when you add another symbol onto an existing flag, it's called defacement.
02:25:05 So we defaced the British red ensign with the, the tree of New England.
02:25:11 Good job.
02:25:12 Defacement, parentheses, complimentary.
02:25:16 Oh, you know what we should do?
02:25:18 You know how like we all had in the PCP, like a color association.
02:25:22 Yeah.
02:25:23 I had like that turquoise greeny blue because of my Gibb and takeo scene.
02:25:27 You had like gray or black.
02:25:29 I was usually like black or white.
02:25:31 Yeah.
02:25:32 Yeah.
02:25:33 We should make a flag that's our two colors because we're the only ones left.
02:25:36 Yeah.
02:25:37 You know what?
02:25:38 It's a great idea.
02:25:40 And I mean, I think I'm, I think I'm solidly purple now.
02:25:44 Purple?
02:25:45 I think I've, I think I've, um, what's, what's the word for like, uh, oh, I learned from Burger Creek.
02:25:52 When one vampire like fully drains another and eats them to gain their power and take their domain over.
02:25:59 Um.
02:26:00 Voir.
02:26:01 Diablerize.
02:26:02 I've, I've diablerized Mage and taken over her purple domain and now I'm the purple one.
02:26:07 I see.
02:26:08 Purple and purple, black and white.
02:26:10 I thought you'd be purple, black and green.
02:26:12 Yeah.
02:26:13 But you're green.
02:26:14 So.
02:26:15 Um, I guess so.
02:26:17 I feel like, I feel like, I don't know, it's to be confusing if I'm like one shade of green
02:26:22 and you're another slightly different shade of green.
02:26:25 Uh, true.
02:26:28 Honestly, I don't really use the Gibb and take pony that much.
02:26:32 The color is like a historical color.
02:26:35 I don't really know if I have like a color.
02:26:37 Like thing anymore.
02:26:40 Yeah.
02:26:41 Um, I was, um, you know, I was going through, I was doing the book, the, the, the book, uh,
02:26:48 index like editing formatting and I had, originally I had your text in a couple of relevant messages.
02:26:55 I had it in like red, like red man, but, um, I, I, I eventually like, there was a couple
02:27:04 of like, uh, uh, messages that like a canny had posted and canny is red and I thought
02:27:09 it was bad to have two reds.
02:27:11 So I, I, I made yours, uh, the teal color, but then that was very similar to the bright blue
02:27:18 that I had, uh, Christine's text in.
02:27:21 So then I like changed her blue to a different blue, like a more like mild blue, but then
02:27:27 I had, then I had to go through and like change all of her texts line by line.
02:27:30 Oh, is this why the book's taken so long?
02:27:32 It's, it's, it's, um, a heap of reasons like that.
02:27:37 That's just one in a long list of like little, little things that I'm like, I got to change
02:27:43 a bunch of stuff to make it all fit, make it all fit on as few, on as few pages as possible.
02:27:48 Um, yeah.
02:27:50 So color shit is bad.
02:27:55 I kind of want to design a flag, but I'm kind of, I've never, I've tried to do it before
02:28:00 and I'm like, I don't know, put the colors.
02:28:03 Honestly, you know what?
02:28:05 Fucking there's a shape maybe.
02:28:07 I think it would be cool if we came up with a new PCP symbol to symbolize that it's just
02:28:15 you and me now.
02:28:17 Uh, cause the old one is just the, the gray tombstone version of the old one.
02:28:22 Right.
02:28:23 Yeah.
02:28:24 And that's not cool.
02:28:25 The time for, I feel like the time for that is over.
02:28:29 Um, we'll take submissions.
02:28:32 Yeah.
02:28:33 Yeah.
02:28:34 Got any, got any ideas?
02:28:35 Cause I don't right now.
02:28:36 Uh, not off the top of my head, but if anyone has any ideas and they want to submit one,
02:28:41 I mean, I'll take a look and uh, we'll gladly steal somebody else's work.
02:28:47 It could be a pirate flag.
02:28:50 We could put like skulls and evolved.
02:28:53 I like skulls.
02:28:54 You like skulls.
02:28:55 I guess we both like skulls.
02:28:57 So.
02:28:58 Okay.
02:28:59 Yeah.
02:29:00 Skulls are good.
02:29:01 You know what?
02:29:02 Skulls are good.
02:29:03 Yeah.
02:29:04 We need them.
02:29:05 Yeah.
02:29:06 Yeah.
02:29:07 We need a Jolly Roger for our, oh shit.
02:29:09 That just, that does remind me.
02:29:11 Did a new one piece chapter come out?
02:29:13 Oh fuck.
02:29:14 I don't think so.
02:29:15 I think one's coming out this week.
02:29:18 Uh, 1072.
02:29:19 Is that the one?
02:29:21 Uh, oh shit.
02:29:23 I, I don't remember.
02:29:26 I read 1072 already.
02:29:28 Oh no, I don't think we talked about this one.
02:29:31 Ah fuck.
02:29:33 The weight of memory.
02:29:35 It's a, I remember reading this, but I forget when I did, but it's, it's got Kuma in it.
02:29:41 Hey, give me a, what website do we use that isn't shit for reading one piece?
02:29:46 TCB scans.
02:29:47 TCB?
02:29:48 Yeah.
02:29:49 TCB.
02:29:50 The coconut brothers.
02:29:53 I assume.
02:29:55 Definitely.
02:29:56 Um.
02:29:57 Yeah.
02:29:58 It's, it's one about Kuma and, and Bonnie.
02:30:01 1071 starts with, that should start with the, like the scientists band.
02:30:08 Wait.
02:30:09 No.
02:30:10 I read, I, okay.
02:30:11 I read this one.
02:30:12 I'll, I'll, if you want to talk about it, I'll have to read it right now.
02:30:15 Uh, well, we'll, we'll save it as like the last thing we talked about before question,
02:30:21 for voice mails.
02:30:22 Okay.
02:30:23 I mean, I feel like we're getting on towards that point.
02:30:26 Yeah.
02:30:27 Shall we do the one piece now then?
02:30:30 I could.
02:30:31 Um, unless you have any more topics.
02:30:34 Uh, I don't know.
02:30:36 Um, not really.
02:30:38 Um, I'm depressed.
02:30:41 My life sucks.
02:30:43 Uh, but what else is new?
02:30:45 No, that's it.
02:30:47 Nah, I'm just gonna throw that out there.
02:30:49 I don't want to follow up that up with anything.
02:30:51 I mean, I'm also depressed, but I've been feeling all right.
02:30:56 It's just sort of, I've been very numb, you know, like I'm thinking about things that
02:31:02 make me sad.
02:31:03 And I'm like, you know what?
02:31:04 I'm not, I'm fuck feelings.
02:31:07 No more.
02:31:08 And then I woke up and I was like, I guess it's just a day.
02:31:12 I don't feel good, but I don't feel bad.
02:31:14 I feel nothing.
02:31:15 And I went through a few days like that and I'm like, this is fine.
02:31:20 Uh, and I just sort of had no response to anything that was happening.
02:31:25 I had no, no reaction to stimulus.
02:31:28 And I'm like, this sucks as well.
02:31:30 Actually, I don't know what to do about it.
02:31:34 Hmm.
02:31:37 I mean, I'm dying.
02:31:40 Yeah.
02:31:42 I'm over here.
02:31:44 I'm just like, um, uh, yeah.
02:31:49 When I say, when I say I'm depressed, I don't mean that I'm like sad constantly.
02:31:54 I just mean I'm, I'm just like, uh, what's the point?
02:31:59 What are we doing?
02:32:00 Yeah.
02:32:01 Same.
02:32:02 Yeah.
02:32:03 Uh, okay.
02:32:05 Well, what else is there really to say about it?
02:32:10 Yeah.
02:32:11 When two depressed people are saved, what's the point?
02:32:12 Yeah.
02:32:13 What is the point?
02:32:14 Yeah.
02:32:15 Hey, you're right.
02:32:16 I guess at that point you just move on.
02:32:17 Yeah.
02:32:18 All right.
02:32:19 So let's read one piece.
02:32:20 Yeah.
02:32:21 All right.
02:32:22 I'm reading.
02:32:23 Genuinely a best reaction.
02:32:25 True.
02:32:26 Okay.
02:32:27 Okay.
02:32:28 Should I, should I like react as I read or should I just, uh, I've read it already.
02:32:36 So you do whatever you feel like.
02:32:39 Okay.
02:32:40 Yeah.
02:32:41 So 10, 72.
02:32:42 Oh, there's the one piece corner, everybody.
02:32:45 What do you have to say about the, the three scientists on the, the front cover?
02:32:50 Oh, um, oh, that's, um, that's, uh, uh, frickin.
02:32:56 It's Caesar, um, the Sanji's dad.
02:33:01 Judge.
02:33:02 Judge.
02:33:03 And, uh, is that, did we, we never figured out who the big guy is, right?
02:33:09 I was told it was queen, which made sense to me as queen was, was like.
02:33:14 Um, one of the, you know, it's the scientist engineer, uh, person of.
02:33:22 I guess he's wearing, I guess he is wearing the same pants.
02:33:27 Yeah.
02:33:28 I think it's pretty clear that he's supposed to be queen.
02:33:30 He's just, he wasn't as fat back then.
02:33:32 He really does not.
02:33:34 And he doesn't have any, like he dyed his hair and turned it into like a long ponytail.
02:33:40 Maybe.
02:33:41 But I mean, if that's supposed to be queen, it does not look like the same guy.
02:33:47 Yeah.
02:33:48 It's a little harder to tell compared to the other two.
02:33:51 The other two I can, I can at least tell, but, um, I don't know, what are they doing?
02:33:57 They got a fruit.
02:33:58 They got chemicals.
02:33:59 Mass producing deadly weapons.
02:34:01 Oh yeah.
02:34:02 Queen's got, well, the artist potentially queen, uh, has.
02:34:09 Bottles of secret evil poisons.
02:34:12 Yeah.
02:34:13 And we know queen did that with the disease disease stuff.
02:34:17 George has a weird laser spear and we know he has that weapon.
02:34:23 And then Caesar clown has the devil fruit.
02:34:25 And we know Caesar clown was working with smile to create artificial devil fruits.
02:34:30 So I guess they're, you know, they're in.
02:34:34 They're a little science nerd group and they're chuckling about all the things, all the people
02:34:39 they'll kill with these things.
02:34:42 I'm okay.
02:34:45 So Bonnie just like whacked Vega punk and turned him into a kid and like fruits exploded out
02:34:55 of him.
02:34:57 Uh, fruits or like little jewel bits, little little gummies.
02:35:02 Yeah.
02:35:03 Is that how it usually works with her?
02:35:07 We have not seen her use her powers for anything other than shape shifting or not shape shifting,
02:35:12 but changing her own age.
02:35:14 She turned herself into like a beefy, like muscle monster.
02:35:19 What does she say?
02:35:20 Distorted future.
02:35:21 Like in a potential future, I could have been this and she can somehow do that, which is
02:35:26 pretty cool.
02:35:28 I see.
02:35:30 It's like everything everywhere all at once.
02:35:32 You ever seen that?
02:35:34 Yeah.
02:35:35 It's like she got a future where, uh, wait a minute, where she was a sumo wrestler or
02:35:42 like a regular wrestler where she's jacked.
02:35:46 Is there's, is there's another, um, oh God, is there another thing where like someone
02:35:54 uses like the power of like the potential future to like become like a theoretical alternate
02:36:01 version of them?
02:36:02 Is that the thing someone doesn't like Jojo?
02:36:04 Oh, it could be.
02:36:06 I haven't read Jojo.
02:36:07 That sounds, that sounds familiar.
02:36:09 Someone being like drawing on, drawing on the power of like a potential future version
02:36:14 of myself to do something that that version of me could do.
02:36:19 I don't know.
02:36:20 Well, that's exactly what happens in everything everywhere all at once.
02:36:23 Like the, is it?
02:36:25 Yeah.
02:36:26 Um, but it's not like potential, it's, it's divergent presence.
02:36:31 So like, yeah, that's not exactly what I'm, that's not exactly what I'm thinking of.
02:36:35 That's like when you, when you jump to another version of yourself in it, in another, well,
02:36:39 that's like jumping into a different timeline.
02:36:41 Yeah.
02:36:42 Yeah.
02:36:43 No, no, that's when you, they do that thing to like, to like, no, they like learn a thing
02:36:48 that like that alternate self, you know, because they inhabit the other timelines
02:36:53 mind temporarily.
02:36:56 Yeah.
02:36:57 I only saw that.
02:36:58 I only saw it once.
02:37:00 Right.
02:37:01 Maybe, maybe, I don't know if that's what I'm thinking of, but that is kind of what they
02:37:04 do in that movie, I guess.
02:37:05 Yeah.
02:37:06 I guess this is different in that she is going from the present into a future where she's
02:37:11 jacked.
02:37:12 She doesn't look older though.
02:37:14 So I don't know.
02:37:15 Yeah.
02:37:16 She doesn't look that much older.
02:37:17 Maybe it's like she's, maybe it's like she's seeing an alternate version of herself that's
02:37:20 like two years older, but it's like, what if I spent two years just like getting really
02:37:24 ripped and working out a lot?
02:37:26 Yeah.
02:37:27 This is very funny.
02:37:29 It's actually, it's actually a pretty funny use of that fruit.
02:37:33 Yeah.
02:37:34 And then taking someone's age, it's more powerful than I had considered because I never really
02:37:38 think about jewelry bunny and her devil fruit, the idea of like her changing age.
02:37:43 Yeah.
02:37:44 Kind of seem like a throwaway power.
02:37:46 The ability to change someone else's age, maybe change the age of like a metal thing to make
02:37:53 it rust.
02:37:54 There's lots of potential there.
02:37:59 Yeah.
02:38:00 Isn't that kind of what, wasn't there one of those, a ninja that did something like that?
02:38:10 The one that would make things rot.
02:38:12 Oh yeah.
02:38:13 The ninja would be.
02:38:14 Shinobu.
02:38:15 Yeah.
02:38:16 What did she do?
02:38:18 She had a power that could make things, I don't know if it specifically made them older or
02:38:24 if it just made them like wither and rot.
02:38:27 Now if I type in Shinobu, I get so many other things.
02:38:30 But she ended up, didn't she end up like becoming young again?
02:38:33 Or was that just like in a flashback?
02:38:34 We saw her young version.
02:38:36 Blah blah blah.
02:38:38 What happened?
02:38:39 What happened in that whole fucking arc?
02:38:41 She's such a small part of it.
02:38:42 Too many fucking things.
02:38:44 Yeah.
02:38:45 Relationships, blah blah blah.
02:38:48 Abilities and powers.
02:38:49 Njutsu, marksmanship, Delafruit.
02:38:51 The juku juku juku no mi gives her the ability to make anything she touches rapidly mature.
02:38:59 So yeah, like rotting, like getting older, but really quick.
02:39:06 I think it's like she calls it maturing, but everyone else calls it like rotting.
02:39:11 Yeah.
02:39:13 What was the name of the fruit?
02:39:16 Juku juku.
02:39:17 What does that mean?
02:39:18 I don't know.
02:39:20 Well, there must be a translation.
02:39:27 Not in the little bit of Wikipedia I'm looking at.
02:39:34 I'll look it up on the wiki.
02:39:37 The juku juku no mi.
02:39:40 Further information.
02:39:41 Okay.
02:39:42 It seems like it just means mature.
02:39:44 Juku comes from jukusura, which means too mature.
02:39:47 Its English name is ripe, isn't it?
02:39:50 Okay.
02:39:51 She could turn grape juice into alcohol.
02:39:58 She can use this power to physically age living beings, although they do not mature mentally.
02:40:04 Oh yeah.
02:40:05 So she turned a little boy, Momonosuke, into an adult.
02:40:10 That's a big important thing.
02:40:12 I forgot all about that.
02:40:13 But hers is permanent and Jullery and Bonnie's is temporary, right?
02:40:17 Yeah.
02:40:18 Yeah.
02:40:19 Well fucked up.
02:40:22 Like if she got her hands on something, just makes them really old.
02:40:24 They can't do anything anymore.
02:40:28 So Jullery, Bonnie turned a punk into a tiny old baby.
02:40:32 Yeah.
02:40:33 He's gotten a little further.
02:40:34 I think he's got like Kuma's memories there in like the paw paw orb.
02:40:39 I'm reading.
02:40:41 I promise Kupa, Kuma, that I will keep his secret from you no matter what.
02:40:48 Power can take something intangible like pain and give it a physical form.
02:40:52 Not only that, but what is fucking up with the paw paw fruit?
02:40:56 The paw paw fruit is freaking stupid.
02:40:59 It's, I mean, it's pretty fine.
02:41:02 Not complaining, but like why the fuck can it do all these things?
02:41:06 You know, it's probably some sort of pun with paw and I don't get it.
02:41:12 Yeah.
02:41:13 Like what is about a bear's paw that can do any of these things?
02:41:19 I guess it pushes really hard.
02:41:22 Pushes it so hard that it pushes feelings out of you, pushes memories.
02:41:27 So I'm wondering if that same logic could be applied to other nervous signals.
02:41:30 To determine whether things like imagination and memories have massive volume as well.
02:41:35 So you want me to pull out my memories and show you.
02:41:38 Please, it will help me advance science.
02:41:41 Okay.
02:41:42 I see.
02:41:44 Whoa.
02:41:46 There's nothing, nothing there but pain, he says.
02:41:50 Okay.
02:41:51 So Kuma, holy shit.
02:41:54 So Kuma took out his own memories and they're in this orb.
02:41:59 He's a crazy robot now, but his memories are there so he could theoretically become his old self maybe.
02:42:06 He could.
02:42:07 Maybe.
02:42:08 But right now he's like climbing the red line and he's getting shot at.
02:42:14 And they said that he was able to, didn't they say that he was allowed to give himself like one directive?
02:42:22 Like they would, they would program him one command that like he got to choose himself.
02:42:27 Yeah.
02:42:28 And he was to protect the, the, the sunny.
02:42:32 The sunny go.
02:42:34 Yeah.
02:42:37 Okay.
02:42:39 Okay.
02:42:41 Holy shit.
02:42:42 All right.
02:42:43 I'm fucking, I don't know what's happening but I'm, I'm excited.
02:42:49 For one brief moment, I forget about the misery and tedium of my actual life and I inhabit the world of the blue, of the, of the red line.
02:42:58 It's glorious.
02:42:59 One glorious moment.
02:43:03 It's like I'm there.
02:43:06 Okay.
02:43:07 Okay.
02:43:08 Reading.
02:43:09 Okay.
02:43:10 The seraphim.
02:43:11 Two against seven.
02:43:12 Yeah.
02:43:13 So the seraphim are up there.
02:43:14 They have, have the CP zero taking control of the seraphim because they got rid of.
02:43:23 Sentomaro.
02:43:24 Sentomaro is, is down still presumed dead.
02:43:29 I think they got him or at least knocked him out.
02:43:33 He's bleeding.
02:43:35 But Vega punk still has authority.
02:43:38 So if a Vega punk is in like hearing range of the seraphim, they will obey Vega punk instead.
02:43:46 And I assume all the different Vega punks count as Vega punk.
02:43:51 Yeah.
02:43:54 As we're hiring, we can turn, he says we can turn the seraphim back to our sides since we're hiring the command hierarchy.
02:44:00 That's assuming we get in there to holler our orders at them.
02:44:03 Okay.
02:44:06 So they should be able to turn the seraphim back.
02:44:12 And Sanji and Frankie are going to fight as well.
02:44:15 Gonna be a brawl.
02:44:17 Why does Frankie call Sanji swirl of him?
02:44:23 What's the joke?
02:44:25 I think Sanji, they're talking about seraphim over and over and then he says Nami's orders are absolute for mere of him.
02:44:34 Yeah.
02:44:36 Okay.
02:44:38 So they're riffing on it.
02:44:42 Fair enough.
02:44:47 Oh my god, it's Kaku. I love Kaku.
02:44:50 Kaku. Oh yeah, Brooke doesn't know them.
02:44:53 He's never met them.
02:44:55 Yeah, that was before.
02:44:57 The guys before.
02:44:59 They fought him in water, was it at water seven?
02:45:01 And he's lobby.
02:45:03 Okay.
02:45:04 Which is directly after and then directly before a thriller bark.
02:45:08 Wait, are you sure?
02:45:12 Didn't they fight CP nine at water seven when they found Frankie?
02:45:15 Yeah, no, they did, but like it was very brief.
02:45:18 They fought like Bruno.
02:45:20 And then they all got on the train and then everyone was, Luffy was like stuck between the chimney and the Aqualagano was coming.
02:45:27 It was like the big wave.
02:45:29 And they got on the train and they left with Robin.
02:45:31 Sanji saw them.
02:45:33 And Sanji got on the train.
02:45:35 And then everyone else, I want to stop, I think it was also on the train or something.
02:45:40 And then the rest of them got on the puffing Tom Frankie edition.
02:45:44 And they followed.
02:45:46 And then like they, they, they, yeah.
02:45:50 And then they, I think they caught up to them.
02:45:53 And it was a whole bunch of stuff on the train.
02:45:55 And then they got to Annie's lobby, which they only managed to fight CP nine.
02:46:01 CP nine after they got over the, like the drawbridge into the other island.
02:46:07 The other, you know, the castle at the end.
02:46:11 Hmm.
02:46:12 Okay.
02:46:13 All right.
02:46:14 I remember it very vividly because I love that fucking arc.
02:46:20 Kaku looks freaking.
02:46:22 Kaku's awakened.
02:46:24 Zoan is pretty cool.
02:46:27 Uh, who me?
02:46:28 I'm just putting him to sleep.
02:46:30 Wait, did she just, she just bit, she's bite Kaku drink his little giraffe blood.
02:46:35 It's a little giraffe blood.
02:46:37 Yeah.
02:46:38 Clone of miss, clone of miss Buckingham.
02:46:40 Stussy of the rocks pirates.
02:46:43 What?
02:46:44 Mads first successful clone.
02:46:46 Unit zero one.
02:46:48 Stussy.
02:46:49 Oh, oh, okay.
02:46:50 It's Stussy.
02:46:51 Do we know Stussy?
02:46:53 Does that, should I, should I recognize that name?
02:46:56 Stussy is the person that this lady has been the whole time, but we didn't know she was a clone.
02:47:02 Yeah.
02:47:03 Okay.
02:47:05 She's like a freaking vampire.
02:47:07 She's like a freaking succubus vampire.
02:47:09 Yeah.
02:47:10 This is, this is a revelation.
02:47:11 This is a weirdo thing.
02:47:13 So like,
02:47:14 Definitely weirdo shit going on here.
02:47:17 So this is so much.
02:47:19 All right.
02:47:20 So she is a clone of a rocks pirates member, which was.
02:47:25 And that's, that's the, that's with the, with the, the other, the emperors, um, big mom and, uh,
02:47:32 Keido.
02:47:33 Keido.
02:47:34 And I think white beard was on the crew at some point as well.
02:47:38 Yeah.
02:47:39 Sounds right.
02:47:40 They're like, and I forget the, the captain of the rocks pirates, very important guy that we've only heard of in like brief mention and, and stuff.
02:47:51 Uh, but yeah, rocks pirates, very important pirate crew.
02:47:53 She's a clone and MADS first successful clone.
02:47:58 And as far as I understand MADS being the science like group that we're seeing in the, in the.
02:48:05 MADS was on that ship, right?
02:48:07 It was on, it was that, that, that like little boat with all the stuff.
02:48:10 Yeah.
02:48:11 That ship that had, that had all the scientists at Vega punk had, um, uh,
02:48:16 George Caesar clown and potentially queen.
02:48:19 Yeah.
02:48:20 And that guy with like the glasses and like the, the, the, the streaks in his hair.
02:48:25 Yeah.
02:48:26 Yeah.
02:48:27 So they're like, they made a clone of one of the strongest pirate crews ever and she's it.
02:48:34 So I don't know whether this means that, um, Miss Buckingham Stussy was a vampire devil fruit user.
02:48:43 Or they gave her.
02:48:44 Or they gave her vampire power.
02:48:47 Yeah.
02:48:49 And, you know, that's one thing.
02:48:51 This has got to be like a vampire bat zone.
02:48:54 Right.
02:48:55 Yeah.
02:48:56 Probably something like that.
02:48:57 Yeah.
02:48:58 But like that's a whole lot of stuff.
02:49:01 But then on top of that, she is betraying CP zero.
02:49:06 And now Kaku and Luchi look like they're going to be like, they're the ones who need saving at this point.
02:49:15 Because the seraphim, they might like, I don't think they are going to follow.
02:49:22 They're going to follow.
02:49:23 They're going to follow.
02:49:24 They're also going to follow until Vega punk is there, whoever has the controller.
02:49:28 And I think she had it.
02:49:30 Yeah.
02:49:31 She, well, she's part of, I think all the CPO.
02:49:34 Have it.
02:49:35 Okay.
02:49:36 Maybe it's not a single item.
02:49:38 I.
02:49:39 Yeah.
02:49:40 I think it's just any anyone in CPO has like a command.
02:49:44 Shit.
02:49:45 That was my understanding at least.
02:49:47 So they might just like equally obey both of them.
02:49:50 Or maybe she's got it.
02:49:52 Yeah.
02:49:53 I don't know.
02:49:54 But yeah, this is like, like what is her deal?
02:49:58 If she's with Mads and Vega punk was on Mads.
02:50:03 Is she aligning with Vega punk?
02:50:07 Is this like a sneaky?
02:50:09 Yeah, maybe.
02:50:11 And like, how long does this con go?
02:50:13 Because she, she is in like, she is in the highest level of assassins.
02:50:21 It's like, I'm really intrigued.
02:50:24 I'm really intrigued by the freaking Paw Paw memory orb.
02:50:30 Yeah.
02:50:32 Freakin legitimately, Kuma has done some like light Yagami, like remove my own memories of
02:50:40 Death Note.
02:50:41 Shit.
02:50:42 What has he got in there?
02:50:44 What does he, what does he want to forget?
02:50:47 Maybe he lost in a video game.
02:50:49 I mean, it seems like it's just all his memories.
02:50:52 But like, why specifically?
02:50:54 Like in this flashback, it looks like it's like a nothing in particular.
02:50:59 Like, oh, it would help me advance science if you let me take your memories out of your
02:51:07 head.
02:51:08 That'd be so cool.
02:51:10 And he's like, that's far too personal.
02:51:13 But like, I guess he ended up doing it because Bonnie recognizes it as a memory thing.
02:51:19 It's okay.
02:51:20 He must know something.
02:51:21 He knows something really important that that Vega punk wanted to learn about.
02:51:29 And I guess it's, I still don't know why he wanted to become a robot.
02:51:39 But I guess he was like, all right, take my memories out.
02:51:43 So when you make me a robot, I can like come back for them later.
02:51:48 I mean, it's got to be some shit about like the void century, right?
02:51:51 He must know some ponyglyph shit, some secret government stuff.
02:52:00 You know, there's a potential here for like a fake out like Lunarian secrets.
02:52:09 There's a potential here for this to have been like a Vega punk, like prank bro.
02:52:15 Like Kuma didn't do any of this of his own volition.
02:52:19 Vega punk just really wanted the science.
02:52:22 And so he tricked him and he doesn't want Bonnie to find that out.
02:52:25 So he says, don't touch it.
02:52:26 Please don't touch it.
02:52:27 I did it.
02:52:28 But she's going to find out.
02:52:30 She's going to know.
02:52:31 And then she's going to kill him.
02:52:33 She's going to really, really hate him.
02:52:35 But it's probably more serious than that.
02:52:37 Given the weight of Kuma and like what he's doing right now with his buddy.
02:52:43 He's, he's just climbing red line.
02:52:46 So he's going to marry.
02:52:47 He's going to marriage war, right?
02:52:49 He's going to marriage war for some reason.
02:52:51 I don't know why he can't like poor, poor fruit his way up to the top.
02:52:55 Yeah.
02:52:56 That's I don't know.
02:52:57 Maybe it doesn't work like that.
02:52:58 Maybe it only goes horizontally, but like it doesn't.
02:53:01 It goes up as well.
02:53:02 Maybe it's exactly it's exactly like building up horizontal speed in Mario when you want
02:53:08 to go to a parallel dimension.
02:53:12 You can only.
02:53:13 Yeah.
02:53:14 You can only move horizontally building a vertical speed is like a whole different
02:53:17 thing.
02:53:18 Ah, did you?
02:53:19 All right.
02:53:20 This is there are vertical parallel universes in Mary 64 as well.
02:53:25 Yes.
02:53:26 I was aware.
02:53:29 And they're like different.
02:53:31 You have to get stuck under something and falling and then fall down onto one.
02:53:37 Yeah.
02:53:39 So I mean, I guess I don't have that much more to say about this other than I sure am
02:53:51 intrigued by all these mysteries.
02:53:53 I like the bit where jewelry is like throwing Vega punk when he's a child version and he
02:54:01 calls it child abuse.
02:54:03 Yeah.
02:54:04 She just.
02:54:05 Yeah.
02:54:06 She just punched out all these little little frickin little what do you call them little
02:54:11 Mike and Ike's.
02:54:13 What are those?
02:54:15 You know those little like hard candies that are in the shape of fruits?
02:54:19 What are those?
02:54:22 A little fruit.
02:54:24 I don't know.
02:54:26 All right.
02:54:28 Gummy winegums hard candy in the shape of fruits.
02:54:31 They're not gummies.
02:54:32 They're like.
02:54:34 Oh, Runtz.
02:54:35 I think they're called Runtz or rascals or nitwits.
02:54:40 I guess they have a bunch of different names.
02:54:44 The years just turned into these.
02:54:47 I just noticed the one panel where they see Kuma climbing and it's like, look, Kuma's
02:54:56 trying to climb the red line.
02:54:58 There's no way he'll make it all the way to the top.
02:55:01 Impossible.
02:55:02 It's just something funny about that.
02:55:04 There's no like like first panel, little meme guy eating cereal.
02:55:11 There's no way he'll make it all the way to the top.
02:55:13 And then he does and he spits out the cereal.
02:55:16 That's what I'm imagining.
02:55:18 Wait, why is he eating cereal?
02:55:20 You know the meme where the little guys eat cereal?
02:55:23 It's like, there's no way.
02:55:24 He will never reach the top of the red line.
02:55:28 Yeah.
02:55:29 Next panel.
02:55:30 No, I got you.
02:55:31 Yeah.
02:55:32 I don't know, man.
02:55:35 I kind of think he's going to probably do it.
02:55:37 I kind of think Kuma is capable of such a thing.
02:55:42 They got all those marines with like mortar bombs and bazookas and sniper rifles.
02:55:48 They're shooting at him.
02:55:50 Oh, yeah.
02:55:52 He'll be fine.
02:55:56 This is just like in Drum Island when Luffy climbed up the fucking thing.
02:56:01 This is just like in Dragon Ball when Goku climbed up the tower.
02:56:07 The Karin Tower?
02:56:10 Is that what I don't remember what it was called?
02:56:12 I can't remember.
02:56:14 I think it was Karin or Karin or something because it's the name of the cat at the top.
02:56:18 The one that made me really mad because when he gets to the top, the cat says like, he
02:56:24 says like, oh, you've gotten stronger.
02:56:28 You've gotten faster and you've increased your endurance.
02:56:31 So you see, you've tripled your strength and it's like that math doesn't make any fucking
02:56:36 sense.
02:56:38 Just because you just because you increased three things does not mean you tripled it.
02:56:44 You fucking moron.
02:56:47 He's just a cat.
02:56:49 He doesn't know.
02:56:50 He doesn't even know basic math.
02:56:52 Yeah.
02:56:53 All that guy's good for is that bean shit.
02:56:55 He's got that good shit.
02:56:56 That is all he's good for.
02:56:57 That is genuinely all he's good for is his bean shit.
02:57:00 He's on his bean shit.
02:57:02 He's in his bean arc.
02:57:04 I hope he stays that way.
02:57:08 Hey, one piece freaking ruled again and I have a feeling the next one will rule also.
02:57:17 I love egghead.
02:57:19 I love egghead arc.
02:57:21 Oh, yeah.
02:57:22 It's hits after hits.
02:57:24 Bunny did do the thing that I talked about oil breakdown.
02:57:27 She touched something.
02:57:29 I guess it was plastic and turned it back into oil.
02:57:33 So that it's crumbled.
02:57:35 It fell to pieces.
02:57:38 I think that's what that implies.
02:57:40 I wonder if it will turn back into plastic later because she says the power is temporary.
02:57:50 Yeah.
02:57:53 Whereas didn't the ninja turn something into oil?
02:58:01 Why do I have the weird memory of that she turned a dinosaur carcass into oil or something by aging it millennia?
02:58:09 That probably didn't happen.
02:58:11 Who?
02:58:12 The ninja with the ripe, ripe fruit.
02:58:15 Oh, a dinosaur into oil?
02:58:18 No, there's no way.
02:58:20 No, I probably had it.
02:58:23 Maybe they made a joke about her doing something like that?
02:58:26 Maybe.
02:58:27 I mean, the only dinosaurs were people and nobody died.
02:58:31 Nobody was turned into fucking oil.
02:58:33 Am I crazy?
02:58:34 Did she threaten to turn Queen's bones into oil like a dinosaur would be?
02:58:41 That sounds pretty fucking cool.
02:58:43 Yeah, yeah.
02:58:46 Or some other dino, man.
02:58:52 God damn.
02:58:54 One piece is better than ever.
02:58:57 How do they do it?
02:59:00 Somebody on this page, somebody on this page down in the comments posted this always relevant meme from Bakuman.
02:59:12 Every fucking week.
02:59:14 Oh God, fuck another banger.
02:59:16 Damn it.
02:59:20 How does he just keep churning out the hits?
02:59:25 So fucking Kaku is just defeated.
02:59:29 Like as far as we know, like he's out called and she just bit him.
02:59:34 Yeah, seems like he just got owned.
02:59:36 She put him to sleep.
02:59:38 She put him to sleep.
02:59:41 And then look, she's like, oh, oh, no, I'm so outnumbered.
02:59:46 I'm sweating.
02:59:47 I can't believe the vampire was evil.
02:59:52 Did they know she was a vampire?
02:59:56 I don't think we've ever seen her do anything like that.
02:59:59 We haven't seen her do anything, so they might have known.
03:00:03 It was already a revelation that this lady was there at all.
03:00:09 No, no, like the first time you see her, she's like, oh, she's an underground kingpin of some sort of business at Big Mom's, the wedding for pudding and Sanji.
03:00:23 Right, right, right.
03:00:25 It's so hard to remember.
03:00:27 And she's like, oh yes, I'm evil.
03:00:30 That's why I was invited.
03:00:32 But then she goes off and does something sneaky and she's like, actually, I'm a secret agent.
03:00:37 I don't know whether she mentions she's in CP Zero at that point, but now she is in CP Zero, but now she's also a clone, actually, of a famous pirate.
03:00:47 Yeah, that's about the size of it.
03:00:50 There's a lot going on with Stussy.
03:00:55 So like there's going to be the Seraphim and Zoro, Brooke, Sanji, Frankie, Luchi, Kaku, and Stussy in this area, and something's going to happen.
03:01:08 And also the warships are coming and also the Admiral.
03:01:12 The warships are coming.
03:01:13 Yeah, I kind of think maybe you're right, and Vegapunk is going to betray them and he's evil, because like things are going a little too well.
03:01:22 I mean, it's just, I don't know.
03:01:28 Why is a clone of the Rocks Pirates even here?
03:01:33 And if it's Madd's first successful clone, who's to say that she's aligned with Madd's?
03:01:41 Maybe she's just being the new Rocks Pirates.
03:01:45 She could be the Primordial Seraphim.
03:01:50 Like she's a clone of a famous pirate.
03:01:53 Just like the Seraphim are clones of the Warlords, but she doesn't have green blood.
03:01:59 She has normal blood.
03:02:02 It doesn't look like she's got green blood.
03:02:06 But she doesn't have a thing.
03:02:07 She does not seem to have a green blood armlet.
03:02:16 Who knows?
03:02:18 At this point, it's just too mysterious.
03:02:22 And then in my mind still is the knowledge that nearby this island, Garp, is going on a rescue mission to save Kobe from Blackbeard.
03:02:34 Oh, right.
03:02:37 And the reason...
03:02:38 Is that nearby?
03:02:39 I don't, I remember that that is happening.
03:02:42 I believe there was some...
03:02:45 Yeah, like Helmapo said, we're close by to Egghead.
03:02:50 Why don't we just get the Seraphim to go save Kobe?
03:02:53 You know, that's what Helmapo mentioned.
03:02:56 So they could go here to get a Seraphim.
03:02:59 Maybe they'll turn up.
03:03:01 I feel like Grandpa Garp's in trouble.
03:03:04 Oh, what's going on?
03:03:08 There's a lot of shit happening.
03:03:12 A lot of shit happening.
03:03:14 A lot of shit happening.
03:03:17 But it is happening.
03:03:21 What I mean, I don't know.
03:03:24 It still feels like it's moving fast.
03:03:30 Oh, yeah.
03:03:31 That is great.
03:03:32 Yeah.
03:03:33 Damn.
03:03:35 Well, another successful one-piece chapter in the bag.
03:03:39 You think we should do voicemails?
03:03:41 Oh, yeah.
03:03:42 Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
03:03:44 So I'll be back in a second, then we'll do that.
03:03:52 Okay, I'm back.
03:03:55 And I got ice cream.
03:03:58 From the toilet?
03:04:00 Yeah.
03:04:05 Delicious.
03:04:08 Okay.
03:04:09 Our first voicemail is called Krabrawler.
03:04:13 Oh, wait.
03:04:15 If you would be so kind to include a time stamp
03:04:19 for when the one-piece discussion begins and ends,
03:04:23 I think some viewers might appreciate that.
03:04:27 So if you would please stop setting the show notes.
03:04:30 Thank you.
03:04:31 Okay.
03:04:32 First voicemail is called Krabrawler.
03:04:35 Three, two, one, go.
03:04:37 Hey, what are your thoughts on Krabrawler?
03:04:40 I've been playing a lot of Pokemon lately.
03:04:42 Boy, howdy.
03:04:43 Let me tell you.
03:04:44 I love Krabrawler.
03:04:47 It's okay.
03:04:49 Oh, yeah.
03:04:50 It's not as cool.
03:04:52 There's like a crab.
03:04:54 There's a new crab.
03:04:55 There's a new crab in Scarlet Violet.
03:04:59 This guy's from Sun and Moon, I think.
03:05:02 Yeah, I remember him.
03:05:04 I remember having him in Sun and Moon.
03:05:06 Okay.
03:05:07 I think Obama...
03:05:09 Is it Obama crab?
03:05:11 Krabomable.
03:05:14 Krabomable is not that good.
03:05:16 Like Fighting Ice is not a great type combo.
03:05:19 And like his stats are okay.
03:05:23 So I kind of don't...
03:05:25 Don't really care for Krabrawler.
03:05:29 Krabomable.
03:05:31 There's not much to recommend him, honestly.
03:05:34 He's... yeah.
03:05:36 I think when it comes to like Sun and Moon Pokemon,
03:05:39 he's like pretty alright.
03:05:41 He's okay.
03:05:43 He's got little funny punchy gloves.
03:05:47 And I guess like a slick back hairdo that is pincers.
03:05:51 He's got like...
03:05:52 I think he's got like a Sylvester Stallone, like one eye.
03:05:56 Like a lazy eye.
03:05:57 I think that's what that's supposed to be.
03:05:59 Yeah, yeah. Boxer.
03:06:02 Or like he's got one black eye or something? Yeah.
03:06:05 He's fine.
03:06:07 Yeah. No real complaints.
03:06:10 I always find like Kingler is the coolest crab they ever made.
03:06:14 Yeah.
03:06:15 That might have a lot to do with the episode of the Pokemon anime
03:06:18 where Krabby turns into a Kingler and saves the day.
03:06:22 The new crab from Scarlet Violet is okay.
03:06:26 Whatever he's called.
03:06:29 Crabbitch.
03:06:31 Yes.
03:06:33 Much, much better.
03:06:35 Okay, that's all I have to say about that.
03:06:37 Next one is Am I Right? 3, 2, 1, go.
03:06:44 What are you saying?
03:06:45 Do you remember that political take you had 30 years ago?
03:06:49 Do you want to discuss about it when you said...
03:06:52 Yeah.
03:06:53 He's right.
03:06:55 It do be like that.
03:06:58 Okay, next one.
03:07:01 Next one is called...
03:07:03 Oh, well, there's an image, but there's also a voicemail.
03:07:07 Let's listen to that first.
03:07:09 3, 2, 1, go.
03:07:11 I've been clicking through random on the RFCK borough looking at art
03:07:17 and I simply need to ask,
03:07:20 what did Gibbon take mean by this?
03:07:25 As a Dutch person, I'm very disturbed.
03:07:28 Wait a minute.
03:07:29 I didn't do this.
03:07:31 I did.
03:07:32 I made Green Man.
03:07:34 That's my original character is Green Man.
03:07:37 But I don't remember.
03:07:39 I don't think I put this thing behind him.
03:07:41 It must be listed as artist Gibbon take because it has your character.
03:07:46 Yeah, like that is original artwork.
03:07:52 Of Green Man.
03:07:54 You'll have to ask someone else why they put them in the Netherlands.
03:07:58 Okay.
03:07:59 Mystery solved.
03:08:01 I remember...
03:08:03 Let me get the original image of Green Man.
03:08:07 Because Green Man is like Green in terms of save the trees,
03:08:13 save the environment.
03:08:16 Is it 2020?
03:08:18 Yeah.
03:08:21 Do you have all your drawings organized by date?
03:08:24 By year.
03:08:26 So yeah, like 2020 folder.
03:08:28 I go back in there.
03:08:30 Don't use toilet paper, save the trees.
03:08:34 Save the trees.
03:08:36 Looks amazing.
03:08:41 I have no idea.
03:08:42 This doesn't answer why he's in the Netherlands.
03:08:44 Maybe they don't use toilet paper over there.
03:08:47 Yeah, I think that's probably true.
03:08:49 Almost definitely.
03:08:52 I'm satisfied.
03:08:55 Next one.
03:08:57 A couple more images.
03:09:00 Let's check them out.
03:09:02 I used to think my life was a cringe compilation until I realized it's actually a try not to laugh challenge.
03:09:09 That's pretty good.
03:09:11 That's pretty good.
03:09:14 Um...
03:09:16 Yep.
03:09:19 Next one.
03:09:22 Let's fucking look at it.
03:09:24 Let's look at it.
03:09:26 Let us look.
03:09:27 Uh-oh.
03:09:29 Oh god.
03:09:31 Hi, few things to start off with.
03:09:33 Yes, I add you because you're a Pegasus to reviewer.
03:09:36 Tis an awesome thing to see.
03:09:37 I'm Phantom Horn.
03:09:38 Don't be intimidated, but I'm not a stereotypical guy like my brother.
03:09:41 Anything.
03:09:42 I'll be the one in the kitchen.
03:09:50 Jenny Knit sent us so many subscribers.
03:09:54 Wow.
03:09:56 She's overflowed.
03:10:00 Why is that her icon in the Sonic hat?
03:10:04 This is what the internet was like back in the Brony days.
03:10:07 We were still using AIM.
03:10:09 Is that AIM?
03:10:11 I think it's AIM.
03:10:13 There was me back in the day.
03:10:15 So much potential.
03:10:17 Before I squandered it.
03:10:21 I'll be the one in the kitchen.
03:10:23 If I was a lady, that's what I would want to hear.
03:10:25 But you wouldn't be in the kitchen.
03:10:27 That would be effeminate of you.
03:10:31 That was before I had my hard MRA turn.
03:10:35 Yeah, this is what I would have said back then.
03:10:38 That's what I mean.
03:10:40 Now I know that you should never go in the kitchen.
03:10:42 Period.
03:10:44 Because there's rats in there.
03:10:49 They ate my tortillas, by the way.
03:10:51 I accidentally left a package of tortillas out in the counter.
03:10:54 And I came back and it was ripped open and rats had eaten it.
03:10:58 Can you imagine how fucked up that is?
03:11:02 Do you have any fucking concept?
03:11:04 I had a little bit of a concept.
03:11:06 Did they climb up to the counter?
03:11:10 They must have been on the counter.
03:11:12 Gross.
03:11:14 Gotta spray that.
03:11:16 Gotta spray it down.
03:11:18 Yeah, I can't eat anything that's been in contact with the counter.
03:11:24 Alright, next one is a Vokeroo.
03:11:26 3, 2, 1, go.
03:11:28 Guys, listen.
03:11:30 Planks are totally worthless and I don't care.
03:11:33 You just do this unpaid job.
03:11:35 Then you'll have nothing to complain about.
03:11:41 I don't get it.
03:11:43 Do this unpaid job.
03:11:45 And then he whips us.
03:11:47 Slavery.
03:11:49 You know, I don't really remember what we were talking about.
03:11:53 So, I don't know what the take was.
03:11:58 Exactly, but I get it.
03:12:00 Slavery.
03:12:04 Very good.
03:12:06 Alright, next one is...
03:12:09 An egg woman.
03:12:11 Let's see.
03:12:13 As a woman.
03:12:15 I can get away with murder.
03:12:19 True.
03:12:21 True. That's why my egg cracked.
03:12:24 I saw Frisco. She said, I'll do evil things.
03:12:27 And I'm like, I love that.
03:12:29 I want to do that.
03:12:30 Love that for you.
03:12:32 Love that for you.
03:12:34 Next one.
03:12:36 Wrestling Battle Royale.
03:12:38 3, 2, 1, go.
03:12:42 You probably won't ever play.
03:12:45 Just look.
03:12:47 I rumble verse the game.
03:12:49 It's the most fun normie shit there is.
03:12:54 I feel like he's recommended this before.
03:12:58 Maybe not.
03:13:00 Rumble verse.
03:13:02 Free to play Brawler Battle Royale.
03:13:04 Yeah, Battle Royale.
03:13:08 You know, I've never played a Battle Royale.
03:13:11 I think I've said this before.
03:13:13 I like the idea of them.
03:13:15 I think the idea of last man standing multiplayer.
03:13:18 Deathmatches are fun.
03:13:20 They are.
03:13:22 It's just the fact that.
03:13:24 In a, you know, like mathematically you join a game.
03:13:28 And there are a bunch of people.
03:13:30 And only one person, like a handful of people get to experience the intense stress and exhilaration of being one of the last few and trying to be the last one.
03:13:42 But most people die instantly or die really quickly and they just have to wait for a long time or leave.
03:13:48 Well.
03:13:49 And like statistically, you're going to have a lot of games where nothing happens and then you have to load another match and it's a lot of waiting.
03:13:58 And I don't like that.
03:13:59 But if you die, doesn't it just like put you in a new game somewhere else?
03:14:06 You don't have to like wait for the old game to conclude, I hope.
03:14:10 No, no.
03:14:11 But like if you're doing a bunch of matches.
03:14:15 Well, yeah.
03:14:16 But I mean, if you die fast, at least it's over soon.
03:14:19 At least it's over quickly.
03:14:21 Yeah, so still don't feel like good.
03:14:25 I'm not good at these sorts of games.
03:14:27 I mean, obviously it's better to win.
03:14:30 I like games.
03:14:31 I like multiplayer games where you can respawn and like it's like a back and forth like team versus team struggle.
03:14:38 So like if you're losing, it's not instant death.
03:14:41 It's not the end of the world.
03:14:42 You can come back.
03:14:43 You can make a comeback in a game like this.
03:14:47 You just have to play perfectly until you win.
03:14:51 And then I don't know.
03:14:53 I mean, it's kind of like it's a little bit like a roguelike.
03:14:56 You know, that's why I hate it.
03:14:58 You start and you go and it's like, OK, this run, maybe you'll do good.
03:15:03 Maybe you do bad, but sometimes you have a good run and then you win and you're like, yes.
03:15:07 Yes.
03:15:09 Honestly, I get it.
03:15:11 That's probably why I dislike it.
03:15:14 But I haven't really played games like this.
03:15:17 TF2 is the best multiplayer game ever.
03:15:21 Well, you can add me because I can defend myself.
03:15:26 OK.
03:15:27 All right.
03:15:28 I got you.
03:15:29 I hear you.
03:15:30 I hear you.
03:15:31 All right.
03:15:32 Next one.
03:15:33 Another image.
03:15:35 Gold.
03:15:36 Oh, yeah.
03:15:37 It doesn't have a name.
03:15:38 It's just an image.
03:15:39 Oh, what is this?
03:15:40 The procrastinator is dating Sim, but there is the Sims.
03:15:45 Sloth.
03:15:46 I don't know what Asidia even is.
03:15:50 OK.
03:15:51 Tom Sloth.
03:15:53 Yeah, maybe.
03:15:54 Munchy Lust.
03:15:55 I'm not sure about that one.
03:15:58 Nate Pride.
03:16:00 Yeah.
03:16:01 Trixie Gluttony.
03:16:03 Yeah, I could see.
03:16:04 I see the case for it.
03:16:06 Ben Wrath.
03:16:07 Yep.
03:16:08 Flattering.
03:16:09 Flattering.
03:16:10 Davoo Envy.
03:16:11 I'm not sure.
03:16:13 Maybe.
03:16:15 Jesse Vainglory.
03:16:16 First of all, that's not a...
03:16:19 I guess so.
03:16:20 Seven deadly sins and they're trying to like turn it to nine people.
03:16:24 What is Asidia?
03:16:25 I've never heard that word before.
03:16:26 I typed it in.
03:16:27 It's like Asidia has been variously defined as a state of listlessness or torpor or not
03:16:32 caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world.
03:16:37 So like sloth, but like a little more specific.
03:16:40 Yeah.
03:16:41 Dictionary.com says it's spiritual or mental sloth apathy.
03:16:47 So.
03:16:48 Yeah.
03:16:49 And then Mage letting others speak over you and bitching about it later, but never just
03:16:54 speaking up, fuck.
03:16:56 I mean, yeah, the worst crime imaginable.
03:17:00 Straight to hell.
03:17:01 No, no, no chance at salvation for that one.
03:17:05 Who's Wrath?
03:17:06 Where's Wrath?
03:17:07 Me.
03:17:08 Oh, you.
03:17:09 Okay.
03:17:10 One, two, three, four, five, six.
03:17:14 What's the seventh one?
03:17:16 Uh.
03:17:17 Is Vainglory and Asidia like neither of those are?
03:17:20 None of them are greed.
03:17:21 Greed.
03:17:22 Yeah.
03:17:23 Where's that?
03:17:24 There's no greed.
03:17:25 And I mean, technically greed is split into, well, I mean, in Dante's Inferno, in the Purgatorio,
03:17:30 greed comes in two forms, parsimony and prodigality.
03:17:37 One is like extreme spending and the other is extreme hoarding.
03:17:41 So you could have split that into two, but instead we got Asidia and Vainglory.
03:17:48 Um, I mean, good, good vocab words.
03:17:52 Did you, did you learn those?
03:17:54 Did Mr. Willaker teach you those in your high school lit class?
03:17:57 You fucking hack.
03:17:59 No, they Googled it.
03:18:01 Yeah.
03:18:02 They typed in thesaurus.com.
03:18:03 That's what I would do.
03:18:04 They typed in, they typed in Asidia to find out what it means.
03:18:07 And they were like, yeah, I'll call, give that.
03:18:11 Uh, okay.
03:18:14 Pretty funny.
03:18:15 All right.
03:18:16 All right.
03:18:17 I had a laugh.
03:18:18 I had a little laugh.
03:18:19 Uh, next one is called What You Think About That, huh?
03:18:22 Three, two, one, go.
03:18:24 She said, past the weed, bitch.
03:18:26 I don't like to pass the gas.
03:18:27 Slowin' bubble, blowin' zaza.
03:18:29 She got big old titties.
03:18:30 I said, Goo Goo.
03:18:31 Goo guy got it a zoo.
03:18:32 Monkey ass niggas.
03:18:33 Ooh, ooh, I'm playing with me.
03:18:36 When the money talking, I cannot hear what you're saying to me.
03:18:39 Little bitches.
03:18:40 Uh, what do I think?
03:18:42 Uh, you know.
03:18:44 I think it's time.
03:18:46 Guys be farting.
03:18:47 I think it's time to toke that fucking blunt.
03:18:51 It's time to fucking smoke up and escape this world.
03:18:55 Escape this cycle of, of yearning and dissatisfaction.
03:19:01 We've got to escape the Dharma and achieve Nirvana.
03:19:08 It's time to free myself from the shackles of this mortal coil.
03:19:12 But first I'll have another scoop of ice cream.
03:19:16 Was that your like, like, was that like, uh, your like,
03:19:20 your like, rep rebuttal?
03:19:23 No.
03:19:24 Put a beat on that.
03:19:25 That was just Buddhism.
03:19:27 Nah, there was a beat there.
03:19:29 There were some bars in that.
03:19:31 All right.
03:19:32 Damn.
03:19:33 It's only because you rhymed Nirvana with something.
03:19:36 With Dharma?
03:19:37 Yeah.
03:19:38 I think that's just because a lot of those words just kind of,
03:19:42 kind of have this end in the same vowel sound.
03:19:47 That's the secret.
03:19:48 That's the secret of rap.
03:19:50 Find those vowel sounds.
03:19:52 You know, you know, the thing about rap is that it's not really a creative medium
03:19:57 because all you're doing is rhyming words,
03:19:59 but like the words already rhymed, right?
03:20:01 Like it's not like you invented those words and made them right.
03:20:04 No, you just found them.
03:20:05 They were already there.
03:20:06 You just found them and put them together.
03:20:07 You're not really making anything.
03:20:09 You know, you know, and, and, and when you get right down to it,
03:20:13 you know, baristas, they don't even actually make coffee, right?
03:20:17 They don't even actually make coffee.
03:20:19 They just serve it.
03:20:20 Okay.
03:20:21 They're not actually doing anything.
03:20:23 They're just enriching.
03:20:24 They're just enriching the billionaires.
03:20:26 They got.
03:20:27 We should kill them.
03:20:28 They got that acedia.
03:20:30 Acedia.
03:20:31 Acidic.
03:20:32 They got pure acedia.
03:20:35 They put, they put, they've put citric acedia all over their freaking cheerios.
03:20:39 They're putting citric acedia all over the cheerios of society.
03:20:43 You know, you know exactly what I'm saying.
03:20:46 You know exactly what I'm talking about.
03:20:48 The cheerios of society.
03:20:50 Yes.
03:20:51 Thank you.
03:20:52 That's what I'm saying.
03:20:53 In meaning that like society could be normal, regular, or it could have honey all over it.
03:20:58 Or, you know, I learned something.
03:21:01 I learned that the state drink of Rhode Island is coffee milk.
03:21:08 Coffee milk.
03:21:09 Coffee milk.
03:21:10 Like, like not coffee with milk.
03:21:12 No.
03:21:13 Coffee milk.
03:21:14 Coffee milk is, it's, I mean, you know, you put chocolate syrup in your milk to make a
03:21:19 chocolate milk, right?
03:21:20 Yeah.
03:21:21 Well, they have a similar thing, but it's coffee flavored.
03:21:24 Um.
03:21:25 Is that not a latte?
03:21:28 Well, no, you don't really get hot.
03:21:31 Cold latte.
03:21:33 Well, what is a latte?
03:21:36 It's an espresso with a lot of milk.
03:21:39 No.
03:21:41 You pretty, listen, there's no actual coffee.
03:21:44 It's coffee.
03:21:45 It's coffee derived, coffee flavored syrup that you put it in milk to flavor your milk.
03:21:51 How can you be coffee flavored without it having coffee in it?
03:21:54 I mean, it's probably, it probably has coffee in it, but it's like a syrup.
03:21:57 It's a syrup.
03:21:58 It's a sugar syrup that's, that's flavored with coffee.
03:22:01 And you put it in your milk and it's not a latte.
03:22:05 It's coffee milk.
03:22:07 It's coffee milk.
03:22:08 And, um, uh, there's a brand.
03:22:14 There's a brand of this stuff called Autocrat.
03:22:16 The brand is called Autocrat and it's from Rhode Island.
03:22:19 And it's the state drink of Rhode Island.
03:22:21 And, uh, you could put it on anything.
03:22:27 Can you believe that?
03:22:30 I guess I can now.
03:22:32 Can you fucking believe that?
03:22:33 Wait, what were we talking about?
03:22:37 Um, wrap.
03:22:40 Let's move on.
03:22:41 Wait.
03:22:42 I swear I had a point.
03:22:45 I swear I had a point.
03:22:46 A seed oil.
03:22:47 The honey.
03:22:48 Citric acid.
03:22:49 Citric acid.
03:22:50 Honey.
03:22:51 Cheerios.
03:22:52 Put it on your cheerio.
03:22:53 That's a fuck.
03:22:54 Let's, okay.
03:22:55 Next one.
03:22:56 Next one is called Did You Miss Me?
03:22:57 Did I download that last one?
03:22:59 Yeah, I did.
03:23:00 Did you miss me?
03:23:01 Three, two, one, go.
03:23:02 Oh no.
03:23:03 God.
03:23:04 It's farting.
03:23:05 I stopped it.
03:23:06 The guy's just playing the record button when he's on the toilet.
03:23:11 I don't think we need to play this, but yeah, it's just, it's the sound of shitting.
03:23:15 It's the sound of shitting.
03:23:16 Have you stopped?
03:23:18 No, I'm still playing.
03:23:20 We don't have to, don't actually play it.
03:23:22 I did listen to the whole thing just to confirm that it's just the sounds of shitting.
03:23:27 My Christ-like sacrifice.
03:23:28 I have taken it upon myself.
03:23:30 I have taken it on the chin, so our audience doesn't have to.
03:23:34 I saw a tweet the other day that was like, it was an old tweet, screenshot it.
03:23:41 And the screenshot to tweet was like, we should just pin all the debt that everybody has.
03:23:47 We should pin everybody's debt on one guy and then kill him.
03:23:51 And the response was like, this is Christianity.
03:23:56 This is literally just what Christianity is.
03:23:58 Yeah.
03:23:59 And it's true.
03:24:00 Yeah.
03:24:01 Pretty good.
03:24:02 Pretty good.
03:24:03 Okay, next one is called Two Mean for No Reason.
03:24:06 Three, two, one, go.
03:24:07 Thoughts on the YouTube comments of these?
03:24:10 Did you understand that?
03:24:11 No, but I think somebody was too mean for no reason.
03:24:14 Thoughts on the YouTube comments of these?
03:24:17 The YouTube comments of these?
03:24:19 Maybe the guy feels the people being mean about him.
03:24:23 I felt like there was voicemails about him.
03:24:26 Did people comment?
03:24:28 All right, next one.
03:24:30 I need other people to appreciate how bad this video is.
03:24:33 Three, two, one, go.
03:24:35 Remember Nate's Mickle video from way back when?
03:24:37 I do because back when it came out, you know, obviously it was trying to communicate some
03:24:41 very simple ideas in an overly complex babble that just goes in one ear and out the other.
03:24:45 But when I recognized that, I was like, okay, well, I don't remember any of the arguments
03:24:49 he even said.
03:24:50 So let me go back and try to parse what he's actually saying to figure out if there's any
03:24:54 worthwhile meaning in this whatsoever.
03:24:56 And when I did, I realized that the video isn't just bad.
03:24:59 It doesn't work on any level.
03:25:01 He constantly introduces terminology under one definition and then later in the video
03:25:06 just contradicts that completely or otherwise misuses terms.
03:25:10 The whole point of the video is that he's making this math formula to represent these
03:25:13 ideas that he has, but he visualizes, you know, this is how the graph would change
03:25:17 in these different contexts.
03:25:18 But if you plug in the numbers from those contexts, the graph doesn't change like that.
03:25:22 So it doesn't have the relationship he's describing.
03:25:24 Why even bother with the graph?
03:25:26 And then he has a second graph that he says is different, but it's the same thing.
03:25:31 It's just the same formula with different letters.
03:25:34 Every time I think of this, I have to obsess over it for a while because it just drives
03:25:39 me insane.
03:25:40 It is.
03:25:41 It's like staring into the abyss to the point that I'm like, I attempted to make my own
03:25:44 video response, breaking down all of the ways that Mikkel is ridiculous.
03:25:48 But I can't justify the time.
03:25:50 So instead of making a voicemail.
03:25:52 Exactly.
03:25:53 And I'm not saying this to be like, you should be an attack dog and attack Nate, but I would
03:26:00 be interested to hear someone point out like, here is just a list of the things that are
03:26:08 wrong.
03:26:09 I would be interested.
03:26:10 Ice.
03:26:11 Here's what's wrong with it.
03:26:12 I have similarly had like, I watched it the first time.
03:26:16 It's like, huh?
03:26:18 Huh?
03:26:19 Like I didn't get it.
03:26:21 It's sort of like incomprehensible in a really like compelling way.
03:26:26 Like I want to figure it out.
03:26:27 I want to figure out this, this, this, these words, these, these hieroglyphs.
03:26:35 I don't think I watched the entire video, but I remember the equation.
03:26:41 And okay, I don't exactly remember what you mean about like he introduces a new equation
03:26:47 and it doesn't have the relationship.
03:26:49 I'm not exactly sure how that goes down, but I remember thinking that like all the, all
03:26:55 the, the graph really is, is just like anything that like Adam toxic, Adam tautically approaches
03:27:01 asymptotically approaches a point.
03:27:04 Like it's, like it's not hard to come up with a formula that asymptotically approaches a,
03:27:10 a discreet value.
03:27:12 And you could do that any number of ways.
03:27:15 And there's nothing really very remarkable about it.
03:27:19 Like that's, like that's all he's describing is that a, is that a value asymptotically approaches
03:27:23 a predefined value and cannot exceed it.
03:27:29 And that's just, and that's just the, and that's just the 80 20 rule.
03:27:33 It's just, that's just, you know, the first it's, it's multiple layers of weird beyond
03:27:38 that because like the value that it can't get higher than is like game quality, which
03:27:44 is not a value you can, you can even like measure or like cap.
03:27:50 It's not measurable.
03:27:52 I mean, you can assign it a value, a subjective value, like if the game is good, you can say.
03:28:01 But like it's a graph that can't be finished because like you, how could you ever say that
03:28:06 you found like the most quality something can have and then plot everything in, you know,
03:28:12 the gaming sphere on that graph.
03:28:15 It just feels like a, it's like not useful for anything.
03:28:21 It's pretty weird.
03:28:23 It's pretty weird to like correlate like technology with quality like, like, like that like technology
03:28:32 somehow determines like the highest possible level of quality as though, as though we didn't
03:28:39 all lose our fucking minds and say that Undertale was the best game ever made when it's like
03:28:45 some fucking RPG maker shit.
03:28:47 You know?
03:28:48 Yeah.
03:28:49 Yeah.
03:28:50 Kind of just a weird premise.
03:28:52 The weirdest part.
03:28:53 A weird premise and like the attempt to like justify it mathematically.
03:28:58 Yeah.
03:28:59 I would say just kind of doesn't, doesn't really do anything.
03:29:03 It's, it's just the, the, the most like memorable part of it for me is that it was meant to
03:29:11 like launch a series of merch off of the idea and it's like the most poorly thought out
03:29:20 formula as well as I don't know.
03:29:24 It's crazy.
03:29:25 I would, I would like, I would also like a video explaining.
03:29:29 I, I, I say this with love, but I would watch a video that like point by point explained
03:29:37 why Mikkel is nonsense.
03:29:39 Yep.
03:29:40 Um, um, the, the, I think if you were doing, if you were doing Mikkel Apologia, well not,
03:29:49 not really Mikkel Apologia, but like Apologia for that video and especially for like the,
03:29:54 the, the, the sort of campaign that preceded it, I think you could maybe call it satire
03:30:01 in that, okay, hang on.
03:30:05 Mikkel is about like technology and like the level of quality that like technology makes
03:30:11 possible.
03:30:12 It's not really about hype, but like the, the, the lead up to it, does it, is it about
03:30:18 hype also?
03:30:19 Isn't it sort of about how like hype can never truly reflect the game's quality?
03:30:23 Because technology limits quality in a way that hype does not respect or reflect or something.
03:30:32 Another complication is that the video is about multiple different gaming, like topics
03:30:39 and opinions he has, um, that are not related, but are nonetheless under the Mikkel umbrella.
03:30:46 Like they don't, they don't have anything to do with one another.
03:30:50 I, I think, I feel like I remember that in some portion of the video, he is talking about
03:30:55 hype culture and, and hype, and on that level, I feel like the, the, uh, like the, the campaign
03:31:05 ahead of time could be taken as satire because he sort of was doing like a hype campaign
03:31:11 for a video about hype.
03:31:13 Only that's not really, that's not really the main thing that the video is about.
03:31:18 No.
03:31:19 Uh, yeah.
03:31:21 So it's a bit, yeah, it's a little-
03:31:25 That feel when sometimes video games don't do what you like.
03:31:33 I almost dropped my empty ice cream tub.
03:31:37 You know, uh, I, you know, there, there is, there is a lot to unpack in that video, honestly.
03:31:46 There really is.
03:31:47 Honestly, not the worst idea.
03:31:50 Someone make a video dissecting it.
03:31:53 Yeah.
03:31:54 I don't know.
03:31:55 I, I would, I would watch it.
03:31:57 Same.
03:31:58 Um, the, the next one is, uh, it says, Nate, is that you?
03:32:03 And it's a, an image.
03:32:05 What is this?
03:32:07 Oh, it's a, it's an AI generated version of an image that already exists.
03:32:14 Well, it's the, it's that, um, that like sad Wojak.
03:32:18 The sad, like doomer Wojak.
03:32:20 The sad doomer gray defeated Wojak with the prompt, my beautiful wife who loves me.
03:32:26 Haha.
03:32:27 And it just became long-haired Nate.
03:32:29 Long-haired female Nate.
03:32:31 Right.
03:32:32 Like biting her lip.
03:32:33 It looks like.
03:32:35 Yes.
03:32:36 I think so.
03:32:38 The teeth are a little weird.
03:32:40 Uh, AI is not good at teeth.
03:32:43 AI is not good at a lot of things.
03:32:46 Yeah.
03:32:47 But, uh.
03:32:48 This is a very odd hairstyle actually.
03:32:50 Now I'm looking at it.
03:32:51 Like that one strand pushes back.
03:32:53 Weird.
03:32:54 The rest sits behind the ear.
03:32:57 Teeth, teeth in particular.
03:32:59 Like if an AI, if an AI makes a face and something is wrong about it, it's usually the teeth.
03:33:05 Like especially if it has like a mouth, it's like its mouth is open.
03:33:08 A lot of the time I see like there's multiple rows of teeth.
03:33:11 Oh yeah.
03:33:12 I can't exactly tell where the teeth end and the mouth begins.
03:33:15 Yeah.
03:33:16 Or whatever.
03:33:17 Teeth and fingers.
03:33:19 Definitely.
03:33:20 Yeah.
03:33:21 Teeth and fingers.
03:33:22 And uh.
03:33:24 Yeah.
03:33:25 Um.
03:33:26 Don't.
03:33:28 It says don't link to it.
03:33:31 NSFW.
03:33:32 The next one is an image.
03:33:34 So maybe you won't.
03:33:36 I just got text under the thing.
03:33:38 You'll want to click on the link.
03:33:40 We'll have to read this.
03:33:43 In Ben's stream today in Mega Man, the water was hacked and undrinkable.
03:33:47 But Ben St. wasn't worried.
03:33:50 Okay.
03:33:51 Vinny is obsessed with me like drinking sweat off of Celestia's huge wobbly ass.
03:33:57 Vinny will not stop.
03:34:00 He just won't stop.
03:34:02 That's it.
03:34:03 I mean.
03:34:05 Looks pretty good.
03:34:07 Looks like a nice full glass right there.
03:34:10 I don't want to contribute anymore to this campaign.
03:34:18 When Ben was playing Mega Man Battle Nightmare, Ben St. had a Princess Celestia's big fat
03:34:24 wobbling ass sweat to drink when there was no other liquid he could consume.
03:34:29 Ben St. couldn't help but let it slip in front of his impressionable young new ball streaming
03:34:34 audience, one of his most darkest desires in life.
03:34:38 Did you say that, Ben?
03:34:40 Is this true?
03:34:42 I say a lot of things.
03:34:44 Gotta go to-
03:34:45 I say a lot of fucked up things when I'm streaming.
03:34:48 Gotta go to twitch.tv slash-
03:34:51 There's only one way to find out.
03:34:53 Is it Ben St. on Twitch?
03:34:54 No, it's St. Comics.
03:34:56 St. Comics.
03:34:58 Or is it?
03:35:02 I think it's-
03:35:03 Yeah, St. Comics with an X.
03:35:05 That's right.
03:35:10 I've themed the whole channel.
03:35:12 I've themed my whole channel.
03:35:13 I made a new banner.
03:35:14 I've made thumbnails for the episodes.
03:35:17 It's all Battle Network.
03:35:19 It's Battle Network all the way down from now until the end of time.
03:35:22 Wow.
03:35:24 Yeah.
03:35:25 Next one is Crooked Beetles.
03:35:27 OK Hand.
03:35:29 3, 2, 1.
03:35:31 Go.
03:35:33 Search for Crooked Beetles.
03:35:36 On TikTok, whatever.
03:35:39 The best thing the community ever did.
03:35:41 It looks like my little pony things.
03:35:44 What are these?
03:35:47 That's just some sort of pony meme stuff.
03:35:52 With comics, with art done.
03:35:56 OK, I mean-
03:35:57 Looks like it could be funny.
03:35:58 It doesn't seem like my sort of thing.
03:36:00 OK.
03:36:01 I've still watched two of them and they've been amusing.
03:36:05 All right.
03:36:06 Next one is Vokeroo.
03:36:08 Let's freaking go.
03:36:11 Let's freaking go.
03:36:14 All right.
03:36:15 3, 2, 1.
03:36:16 Go.
03:36:18 I did it.
03:36:20 I am enabled.
03:36:22 I am loved.
03:36:23 Everybody likes me.
03:36:26 We're best friends already, right?
03:36:28 We're hanging out.
03:36:30 Bad and Gib.
03:36:31 Yeah.
03:36:32 But actually, at this point, I think you recognized me already,
03:36:38 but I have something I need to confess.
03:36:44 It's really hard to say, but...
03:36:51 Haha, just kidding.
03:36:54 No.
03:36:55 It was me, Oblivion, fall the whole time.
03:36:58 No.
03:36:59 Oh, you fell for it.
03:37:01 Oh, you're so gullible.
03:37:03 You're so gullible.
03:37:06 I don't believe it.
03:37:07 I believe this is there in Cahoots.
03:37:09 It kind of been Oblivion Fall just far away from the mic doing an exit,
03:37:13 and it kind of been.
03:37:14 It must have been two different people.
03:37:16 I don't think Oblivion Fall would lie.
03:37:18 I think-
03:37:19 No, I feel like Oblivion Fall is the ultimate liar.
03:37:22 No, you're right, though.
03:37:24 You know what?
03:37:26 You're absolutely right.
03:37:28 Well, I didn't see that coming.
03:37:30 There's no way all the voicemails are a whole module news.
03:37:34 There's no way there's all the same guy.
03:37:36 There's different people, I swear.
03:37:38 They're all different people.
03:37:40 He's been doing a bit this whole time for years.
03:37:44 Every single viewer is the same.
03:37:46 It's all Oblivion Fall.
03:37:48 I believe it.
03:37:49 I believe Oblivion-
03:37:51 He just spams the refresh button to give every one of our videos like a thousand views now
03:37:55 just to give up the illusion that anyone is still listening.
03:37:57 Just to keep us trapped in our little fishbowl for him to tap on.
03:38:03 Next one is called A.I. Ramblings.
03:38:07 Three, two, one, go.
03:38:09 I find A.I. generated images very fascinating.
03:38:14 The thing is, you know, the A.I. struggles with generating hands
03:38:19 and if you're in a dream and you look at your hands,
03:38:23 then they look fucked up and I'm not making this up.
03:38:28 They look fucked up.
03:38:31 And the thing is, right?
03:38:33 Get away from the microphone.
03:38:35 The A.I. is similar to my unconscious brain.
03:38:38 It's dreaming. The A.I. is dreaming.
03:38:40 This is a common comparison.
03:38:42 Does that say that the A.I. is unconscious?
03:38:47 It's like an unconscious mind.
03:38:49 It doesn't have a soul or something.
03:38:52 That's kind of a crazy idea.
03:38:54 What are you talking about?
03:38:56 You know how you don't remember your dreaming when you wake up?
03:39:01 What if when you're a child, you're just dreaming.
03:39:05 You're in a dream before your soul comes into your body
03:39:10 at a certain age and then you wake up
03:39:14 and you don't remember your dream anymore.
03:39:17 Kind of a crazy notion.
03:39:20 But I find it really weird that I was able to talk
03:39:26 many years before I could actually remember what I said.
03:39:30 Like, why the hell was I fully conscious and intelligent
03:39:34 before I was able to form memories?
03:39:38 What the fuck?
03:39:40 That is kind of interesting.
03:39:42 The idea that you may have been dreaming
03:39:45 before you came out of the womb, but you forgot it.
03:39:49 Even after that, I don't remember when I was like one, two...
03:39:54 No, yeah.
03:39:55 I don't really have memories until I was maybe like four or so.
03:39:58 And yet you probably had input.
03:40:05 Yeah.
03:40:06 But I mean, there's lots of times in my life that I was conscious
03:40:12 but I don't remember them.
03:40:14 I don't remember my whole life.
03:40:16 No, yeah.
03:40:18 If you get drunk and you black out and you don't remember the next day,
03:40:22 were you dreaming?
03:40:24 Were you just dreaming?
03:40:25 That's why it's really important to use recording technology
03:40:29 to record babies and drunk people so they remember it.
03:40:34 And you can show them later.
03:40:35 Yeah, this is when you were so young
03:40:37 that you didn't know how to fucking not cry, you idiot.
03:40:41 I'm going to blackmail you with this.
03:40:43 I'm going to show everyone that you used to cry when you were a baby
03:40:46 and you used to throw up and you didn't even say you were sorry.
03:40:50 You're such a rude baby.
03:40:51 You didn't even pay rent.
03:40:53 You got to pay it back at some point.
03:40:57 Do you have to pay rent while you're in the womb?
03:41:00 Do you count?
03:41:01 Do you have to do that?
03:41:05 Could you be charged rent while in the womb?
03:41:09 You could charge anyone anything you want.
03:41:15 It's like Calvin's dad.
03:41:17 Calvin's dad says like,
03:41:20 there's one stripper he tells him that it costs like $10,000 to raise a kid to adulthood
03:41:26 and that's a lot of money.
03:41:27 He says, like, is that a gift or is that a loan, Calvin?
03:41:31 It's like, that's kind of fucked up.
03:41:33 Yeah.
03:41:34 Calvin's dad.
03:41:35 Calvin's dad is usually cool, but he's got a bunch of boomerisms.
03:41:39 He's got a bunch of like shitty, like reactionary boomerisms.
03:41:42 His shovel the walk, like labor builds character thing sucks.
03:41:45 His like, should I make you pay back what it cost to raise you, Calvin?
03:41:51 Like that sucks.
03:41:53 This was an investment and I expect to return.
03:41:57 Yes, exactly.
03:42:06 What was I talking about?
03:42:07 Is the AI dreaming?
03:42:08 I don't know.
03:42:09 AI is dumb.
03:42:10 AI couldn't beat me in a punching match.
03:42:15 I've never noticed.
03:42:17 I've never noticed my hands looking weird in a dream,
03:42:20 but I guess I've never really like tried to like carefully examine them.
03:42:25 I mean, AIs do, like, yeah, they do kind of look like a dream
03:42:30 because it's sort of like, sort of makes sense when you look at it,
03:42:33 but then when you try to examine the details, it's like, wait,
03:42:36 what is that?
03:42:37 Wait, this doesn't make any sense.
03:42:38 Yeah.
03:42:39 I have enjoyed like the technology like in its infancy being like fucking weird
03:42:45 but still recognizable kind of like a really blurry image of a bunch of stuff on a table
03:42:51 that all looks like it's fine until you recognize that nothing is a real object that you would ever see.
03:42:58 Did you see those images of like people partying that were AI generated?
03:43:04 No.
03:43:05 There were some, I think it was like last week, there was a set of images going around
03:43:09 and someone posted them like, AI generation is getting really good.
03:43:14 They posted it like, it's really good.
03:43:17 Like, these aren't, these are not even real people, believe it or not.
03:43:21 And it was like pictures, I mean, I'll find them.
03:43:24 I'll find them.
03:43:25 There was that one website that was like, it purported to completely generate a fake human using AI,
03:43:37 but then it came out later that they were only sort of like changing like an entirely real photo of a person
03:43:47 but just changing some small aspect of it.
03:43:50 Okay.
03:43:51 I saw that thread and like, I thought it was a hoax.
03:43:55 I thought the person who was posting those images and saying like,
03:43:58 this is basically just like, it was like they were faking it.
03:44:03 It wasn't, or I saw at least one thread where like, it wasn't actually doing that.
03:44:10 I don't know.
03:44:11 I mean, they had like, they had the AI generated version and then the image it was based on and it was very, very similar.
03:44:19 It was like the AI had not really taken aspects of the face.
03:44:24 They've taken like almost the entire face.
03:44:27 So it's like technically AI generated using input, but like, it was more successful because it was using such huge amount like percentages of images rather than mixing and matching.
03:44:41 Yeah.
03:44:42 I have seen some that like, they come out and you can kind of be like, well, this mostly just copied another image.
03:44:49 Anyway, yeah, it was these, it was these pictures.
03:44:52 Say I'm like, oh, AI is getting so good.
03:44:54 And like, yeah, they do look like photographs when you look at them until you like, I mean, look at the teeth.
03:45:05 Look at the teeth and look at the fingers.
03:45:08 And it's really scary.
03:45:11 It's really uncanny.
03:45:12 Like you can, it looks like a picture, but you can tell there's something wrong.
03:45:17 And it's only when you like start to look for what it is that's wrong, you know, you start to, it starts to get really like uncomfortable.
03:45:26 The second one is just like a hand floating in air.
03:45:29 I just noticed that.
03:45:30 Like with a bit of a thumb, like hovering next to it.
03:45:34 Yeah.
03:45:35 Ew, that's disgusting.
03:45:37 That is, that is the most disgusting part is that these are teenagers and they're partying.
03:45:42 True.
03:45:45 Yeah, you know, I, it seems weird.
03:45:48 The first one you posted and then I click on it and it's like, wow, that is a fucked up looking face.
03:45:53 Look at those teeth.
03:45:54 They just keep going.
03:45:56 Yeah.
03:45:57 Yeah, they just keep going.
03:46:00 The other floating hands.
03:46:01 She has, she has Michael Jackson, like surgery face energy.
03:46:06 Honestly, I wonder if the, I wonder if that thread was, was like, they deliberately picked pictures that were like a little bit wrong.
03:46:15 And because I feel like you could, if you really wanted to make it look like the technology is really good, you could find some that like did look almost like undistinguishable from a real photograph.
03:46:31 You could cherry pick some if you really wanted to.
03:46:34 They must have known that these don't look quite right.
03:46:37 Right.
03:46:39 Yeah.
03:46:40 Well, like these pictures.
03:46:42 All of them, all of them have something noticeably wrong with them.
03:46:46 Maybe they're, they're just being like really, really generous and saying, oh, that's getting so good.
03:46:51 Like there's only like seven extra fingers.
03:46:55 Maybe.
03:46:56 Yeah, it's, it's, it's hard to know.
03:46:58 There's a lot of people who want to be very generous to AI technology because they stand to profit off it.
03:47:05 I have, I have seen people talking about it that just clearly have like no sense of aesthetics and no sense, no, like feeling of like when something looks good or not.
03:47:17 But.
03:47:19 That's human story being the case that like the point of this thread is that it's meant to get generated engagement by you say that it's good.
03:47:29 But then the examples you give are like, it's not that it's not really that hard to see that this lady holding the camera has like nine fingers.
03:47:37 And that one with the two guys, they look like they got the big slicked hair.
03:47:44 I like the, the twisted Bop it looking thing on the table.
03:47:50 Yeah, I, I don't know what that is.
03:47:53 It looks weirdly in focus compared to the out of focus bottles right behind it.
03:47:57 And that, yeah, that cup is like floating that cup is clearly not on the table.
03:48:06 Oh, yeah.
03:48:07 If you look at the background, it's funny, like there's a door.
03:48:10 And right next to it, there's another door kind of and then.
03:48:14 Yeah, there's two doors right next to it.
03:48:16 And there's a really flat, weird door with a dark on the other wall.
03:48:22 Yeah, it looks like it's around a corner or something.
03:48:26 The doors are fun.
03:48:29 Um, anyway, yeah, this is, this is what I was talking about.
03:48:36 Like it's bad, it's bad at fingers, it's bad at teeth.
03:48:40 And something about just the face to the eyes are like the eyes and the skin is like a little too focused, but I don't know.
03:48:49 Some, some bits are fine because like in real life, like if it's in shadow, if somebody's eyes are in shadow because of an overhead light.
03:48:57 You can't see what their face looks like properly anyway.
03:49:01 So like, yeah, like AI can make certain parts of images look sort of like they are real.
03:49:09 It's just not, not that great.
03:49:12 I mean, on that first picture, the girl on the far right looks pretty much fine.
03:49:19 No way.
03:49:22 Looks, yeah, like a couple of, like.
03:49:26 Oh, her neck.
03:49:27 Oh, her neck.
03:49:28 Fine.
03:49:29 Yeah, yeah.
03:49:30 Then something's, it's like she has two, she has two, I don't know what you call it.
03:49:36 Colour bones.
03:49:37 The little like divot in between the clavicles where the two like neck tendons connect.
03:49:41 She's got two shoulders.
03:49:42 She's got two of them.
03:49:43 She's got two right colour bones and two right shoulders.
03:49:45 You just can't see him.
03:49:47 And her dress just doesn't, it just keeps going down.
03:49:52 Oh, no, you're looking at the one on the left.
03:49:54 Or no, are you looking at the one on the right?
03:49:56 On the right.
03:49:57 Because they're both kind of fucked up in the clavicle regions.
03:50:00 Yeah.
03:50:05 Intriguing.
03:50:06 On the phone or whatever is being held on the left.
03:50:10 It's just a finger with two like ends.
03:50:13 Yeah, yeah.
03:50:14 A finger with two.
03:50:16 Yeah, that one.
03:50:17 That's this guy.
03:50:18 Those fingers are like really.
03:50:21 Fucking four dimensional hands.
03:50:24 It's like, it's just like those creatures, the crawl knee in the, what do you call it?
03:50:33 Frickin, to save her.
03:50:35 Jennifer Diane writes, pastel defender heliotrope.
03:50:40 And the other one.
03:50:43 The ones that are like higher dimensional beings.
03:50:46 And so like parts of them like don't even connect to each other.
03:50:49 They're just kind of like floating like blobs.
03:50:51 Because like they connect through like a different dimension.
03:50:54 Yeah.
03:50:55 It's like part, it's like a little portion of it is just peeking out into the third dimension.
03:51:00 And that's the like disconnected bit of that, that fricking hand that most of a hand and piece of a thumb just floating in the void there.
03:51:09 Yeah, okay.
03:51:11 So anyway, the next one is called circumcision.
03:51:18 My least favorite topic.
03:51:20 Three, two, one, go.
03:51:23 Hey, I'm sorry to leave another voicemail like this, but concerning circumcision.
03:51:30 Yeah, please get away from the mic.
03:51:31 You're too close.
03:51:33 On some circumcisions, they take all of the foreskin and other ones, they just kind of fold it back.
03:51:39 It's pretty disgusting, but um, yeah, in theory, if you like stretched it out, right, like twice as the skin, like twice as normal length.
03:51:49 Or it's modified length, I guess it's not normal.
03:51:53 You could have like the foreskin covering the penis again.
03:51:59 Or at least what's left of it, which would be better, I guess.
03:52:06 I saw this great presentation by Eric Klopper.
03:52:11 I think his name is about circumcision.
03:52:15 I don't know, changed my mind on a couple of things.
03:52:19 Well, haven't seen it, haven't heard about it.
03:52:25 I guess, I guess it makes sense that like, I mean, but if the circumcision left some foreskin, then like, why do you need to like, I mean, you just still have some foreskin.
03:52:35 You don't need to like stretch it, it's still there.
03:52:39 Once they, you know, tasted the bit of the sun, you know, they got a taste for it, they need more.
03:52:47 I don't know the expression.
03:52:49 I guess.
03:52:50 Was it like Icarus, you flap your toes, gets that sun, gets that tan.
03:52:56 I don't even know what happens.
03:52:58 What?
03:52:59 What do you think the story of Icarus is about?
03:53:01 What do you think they were trying to do?
03:53:03 They were trying to get to the sun, I don't know.
03:53:05 They're trying to fly really high.
03:53:08 They were trying to escape from an island.
03:53:10 No, I remember, I remember.
03:53:11 I think Icarus and his dad were trapped on an island where they tried to fly away from it.
03:53:14 They were trying to, they were trying to escape and they thought the only way out was through the air.
03:53:18 They made wings out of birds feathers and wax.
03:53:22 Yes.
03:53:23 And they flew, but then he was like, oh, this is great.
03:53:26 I'm going to fly to really high because I'm so cool.
03:53:30 I'm rainbow dash and then he got too close.
03:53:32 The Greeks didn't even know that like he doesn't get hotter when you go up in the sky.
03:53:38 Yeah.
03:53:39 Why do they think the birds are not like cooked when they come down?
03:53:44 They're close to the sun.
03:53:46 You can close to the sun because hot up there.
03:53:49 The sun's warm.
03:53:51 It makes sense, but they just didn't know.
03:53:54 They didn't understand.
03:53:55 Maybe they didn't bring candles on mountain expeditions in case they melted.
03:53:59 And that's why we don't talk about them anymore today because they were outdated.
03:54:03 Those Greeks, frankly, they're stupid.
03:54:06 They were so stupid and so embarrassing.
03:54:09 Nobody likes them.
03:54:12 Here's another Imgur link for you.
03:54:16 It's not loading in the chat, but.
03:54:18 I see it.
03:54:19 That's okay.
03:54:20 Ah, the Amazonian cat head, great on a toast.
03:54:24 See, the trick to these things is.
03:54:28 Oh, it's the dream.
03:54:30 It's the dream someone had.
03:54:32 Oh, from last episode.
03:54:34 Did someone have a dream that I got bit by a snake?
03:54:37 Like a cat-eared snake.
03:54:40 Great on a toast.
03:54:41 Great on a toast.
03:54:45 I mean, some people eat snake, I guess.
03:54:50 That's me.
03:54:51 Whenever I see any animal, I think that look, that would be delicious.
03:54:55 That thing looks tasty.
03:54:56 Get over here.
03:54:57 You little creature.
03:54:58 See the trick to these things.
03:55:03 Hubris.
03:55:04 I love it.
03:55:06 Exactly.
03:55:07 Can't get enough.
03:55:08 Exactly.
03:55:09 That's pretty good.
03:55:12 I got what I deserved.
03:55:14 Next one is called My Head Cannon.
03:55:17 Three, two, one, go.
03:55:19 Babe, babe, I'm sorry, but you can't come over for a while, okay?
03:55:24 The thing is, I don't know if you saw, but that guy, he gave me a really evil eye when
03:55:31 we were cooking together.
03:55:33 I get the feeling he's like the school shooter type that never got the chance to do it.
03:55:40 I feel like he's going to hurt me if he thinks I'm not a sigma male.
03:55:45 I think I got to show that I cook on my own as well.
03:55:49 Then I'll just pretend that I cook for myself all the time, and then he won't hurt me.
03:55:56 Then you can come back, okay?
03:55:58 Okay, babe, thanks.
03:55:59 Sorry.
03:56:00 Damn, that's true.
03:56:01 I can't believe.
03:56:02 That's right.
03:56:03 I can't believe I fell for it.
03:56:06 I can't believe a trick worked on me.
03:56:08 What the fuck?
03:56:09 Just let him cook, Ben.
03:56:11 You got to learn.
03:56:12 You just got to let him cook.
03:56:13 Well, I just got to let him cook.
03:56:15 That was my mistake.
03:56:17 Hang on.
03:56:18 I was just seeing him breaking bad recently where Walter says, let us cook.
03:56:23 I thought, is that where it's from?
03:56:25 I'm not sure.
03:56:26 Does he say let us cook or does he say let's cook?
03:56:28 He says, let us cook.
03:56:30 Like he's telling someone else to just let us cook.
03:56:32 Yeah, it's like when he kills Gale and he's the only chemist Gus Fring has left.
03:56:39 He says, come on, Gus, just let us cook.
03:56:43 We're cooking.
03:56:44 Yeah, you know, I was thinking too.
03:56:45 I'm not sure if let them cook is like a breaking bad reference.
03:56:49 It might be, but it could just as easily not be.
03:56:53 I'm not sure.
03:56:54 There is a point later in the show where like Jesse is cooking in Mexico.
03:57:01 Maybe they say let him cook there because he's...
03:57:05 Even if they don't actually say it, it could still be like what people think of when they
03:57:11 say it and it could be part of why it caught on.
03:57:16 Honestly, someone make a freaking video essay about it.
03:57:19 Or Google it.
03:57:20 One or the other.
03:57:22 Yeah, one or the other.
03:57:23 Either way, it doesn't matter to me.
03:57:26 Next one is called Head Cannon Continued 321 Go.
03:57:33 Oh God, I really have to speak this plan up.
03:57:36 I really have to make sure that he sees me fucking make my own schnitzel.
03:57:41 Because, babe, I think he just tried to poison me.
03:57:45 He put fucking citric acid in my cereal.
03:57:49 I thought I was going to die.
03:57:53 What if next time he put cyanide in my milk or something?
03:57:59 I was going for the cyanide, but I got the citric acid instead.
03:58:05 This guy's a menace.
03:58:07 Next time.
03:58:08 He's probably called Dennis.
03:58:13 Alright, next one is another Imgurlink.
03:58:16 Oh, if you want my comic, you can read it, but you'll have to find it first.
03:58:23 Did I say that this was found?
03:58:25 Yes, you mentioned on your stream and then I went and found it.
03:58:28 I went to the site and I read every single one.
03:58:32 Actually, I read a bunch of them.
03:58:34 I think there's too many to read.
03:58:37 Do they continue into the current day?
03:58:40 I don't even know.
03:58:41 I didn't actually go and read them.
03:58:43 There's a bunch.
03:58:44 There's really, really a lot of funny ones.
03:58:47 Someone called RustinRobot went and found it and it is called Jennifer's Show.
03:58:55 J-E-N-N-F-E-R.
03:59:01 It's the person who makes them calls herself Jennifer J.
03:59:06 The non-cat girl is Jennifer and I think the cat girl is J.
03:59:12 Something like that, but anyway, yeah, Jennifer's Show.
03:59:16 It's just a comic about-
03:59:18 They have a YouTube channel.
03:59:19 They have a YouTube channel and it's a comic about these two characters who are in lesbians with each other.
03:59:28 They're in lesbians with each other, yes.
03:59:29 And they have huge boobies and it's just wholesome and that's it.
03:59:37 Sometimes it's funny in an unintentional way and sometimes it's funny in a deliberate way,
03:59:42 but the joke is very odd and that makes it funny in a different way.
03:59:48 There was a really good one.
03:59:51 A spork posted a really good one in my server that was like,
03:59:58 Jennifer drinking wine and being like, bring the popcorn, honey.
04:00:03 It's time for the Kiwi Farms.
04:00:05 Time to watch the movie of our Kiwi Farms thread roasting us again and it was pretty funny.
04:00:14 It's like being made by someone who is not good at drawing.
04:00:21 I love how so many spelling errors all the time.
04:00:28 Yeah, yeah.
04:00:30 It just makes it seem more like a deliberate parody and it just is not.
04:00:35 It does seem almost like a deliberate parody.
04:00:39 Here's the one that I'm talking about.
04:00:44 It looks like she's drinking iodine or something.
04:00:48 So basically we found the one piece.
04:00:51 Yeah, we found it and now I can read it.
04:00:55 I'm crying in this image.
04:00:57 Quick, Jen, get the popcorn soda, the drunk movie night,
04:01:01 goaning to start in Seven Min over at Kiwi Farms Discord page.
04:01:07 True.
04:01:10 This person is a little weird.
04:01:15 Their YouTube channel is a little bit unsettling.
04:01:18 Yeah, I didn't really watch any of their vlogs.
04:01:21 Yeah, I didn't really want to watch much of it,
04:01:26 but it's a couple of very strange videos of her in a huge stuffed shirt
04:01:34 with some fake glasses that kind of look like the ones she draws,
04:01:39 big oval pieces of cardboard or construction paper,
04:01:45 just waving around, just flopping around and looking a bit awkward.
04:01:55 There was a few that were just like,
04:01:58 this is like a sweet brown hella Jeff comic.
04:02:02 It's not even slightly dissimilar.
04:02:06 It's exactly what a sweet brown hella Jeff comic would be
04:02:09 just with less NS paint fuckery.
04:02:12 But the methods of drawing, sometimes with outlines,
04:02:19 sometimes they'll use a slanted pen that use for calligraphy.
04:02:25 Sometimes it'll just be with photographs as the backgrounds.
04:02:32 It's just great.
04:02:36 I love it.
04:02:37 It is.
04:02:38 It kind of is great, but it's definitely done.
04:02:42 There's no irony to it at all.
04:02:45 It's not done in a knowing wink wink ha ha way.
04:02:49 It's meant completely sincerely.
04:02:51 Yeah, it's amazing.
04:02:53 It is kind of amazing.
04:02:56 I actually should probably go and read through some just to see.
04:03:00 I haven't done that yet, but it's been found.
04:03:03 Resting Robot found it.
04:03:05 Appreciate it.
04:03:06 Mystery solved.
04:03:09 Good illustration here, though.
04:03:13 Good joke.
04:03:14 All right.
04:03:15 Next one is an Imgur album.
04:03:18 Let's freaking go.
04:03:20 Let's freaking go.
04:03:22 Oh, it's a Mega Man G Fuel blue bomber slushie.
04:03:29 As an energy drink.
04:03:31 I've seen this before.
04:03:33 I think it's just the flavor is called slushie.
04:03:36 Like it's not actually a slushie.
04:03:39 I guess you'd need it to be ice in a can.
04:03:44 I saw this when I was looking for that e-tank cup that I bought to drink out of.
04:03:50 I did see this and I considered buying some just to see what it tastes like, but it didn't.
04:03:56 I wonder if this person actually found it in Walmart.
04:03:59 If this person actually found it in Walmart like in current year, I'd be shocked.
04:04:04 And I would think that was amazing if it were like still being sold.
04:04:13 Maybe.
04:04:15 They're making a new Mega Man.
04:04:17 They're making a new one with the highest budget ever.
04:04:21 Who knows what it'll be.
04:04:24 Next one is called four skin forever or in my case 10 in one half skin.
04:04:33 Why is it always four skin coming back to the show?
04:04:37 Wait, it's not playing.
04:04:39 It's not playing for me either.
04:04:40 I think it's because they know it annoys me.
04:04:43 Okay, it's playing.
04:04:45 Hey, dude.
04:04:48 I was just listening to your podcast and I heard this funny voicemail about regrowing your four skin.
04:04:56 You know how dudes like gauge their ears and stuff?
04:05:00 Well, basically you could gauge your four skin, not with like an ear gauge hole gap, but like a disc that will stretch your skin so that it can basically become longer and more pronounced like how you would with your ear lobes.
04:05:19 But instead of your ear lobes, it's your four skin.
04:05:22 Try it out, dude.
04:05:24 I got a sweet 10 and a half inches right now.
04:05:27 I mean.
04:05:30 Congratulations.
04:05:32 Just keep going.
04:05:34 Stretching.
04:05:35 It's like jelking, but just the skin, not the whole dick.
04:05:40 Yeah.
04:05:42 You know about jelking, right?
04:05:45 I think so.
04:05:46 Is that like a suction pump penis thing?
04:05:50 No, it's like a thing.
04:05:52 It's like a technique.
04:05:55 It's like a thing you do to basically stretch your dick out.
04:06:03 You basically damage your dick a little bit.
04:06:06 You fucking squeeze it in a way that causes it to be damaged a little bit and then when it heals, it theoretically lengthens it.
04:06:19 It's like you like freaking squeeze and stretch it to the point that it like causes harm and then it heals and maybe it gets longer.
04:06:29 Yeah.
04:06:30 And that's jelking.
04:06:31 That's a weird, like I remember seeing it as like a thing discussed, but it looked shady and scary.
04:06:37 So like I don't want to look at it.
04:06:39 I've heard people say that, yeah, it's not good for it.
04:06:42 I think it's an act of desperation.
04:06:45 It might work to a degree, but like probably at what cost, I think is the question.
04:06:54 It's just like, if there is like an increase, it would be very minor, like minuscule to the point where it really is not worth the effort.
04:07:06 I learned.
04:07:07 You can't gain an inch from like a weird technique like that.
04:07:11 That just doesn't know how it works.
04:07:14 I doubt it.
04:07:17 I learned from Little Joel recently.
04:07:19 Did you watch Little Joel?
04:07:20 Oh, yeah.
04:07:21 Love Little Joel.
04:07:22 Did you see the one about the lady that cut the guy's dick off?
04:07:27 Yeah.
04:07:29 Okay.
04:07:30 Well, I'll say it for the audience's benefit, I'll say that I learned from that.
04:07:34 Yeah, that lady that cut her like rapist husband's dick off, he got the dick repaired.
04:07:42 But then he went back to have her dick surgically enlarged and the dick enlargement surgery destroyed his dick.
04:07:50 Yeah.
04:07:51 He wasn't having the dick cut off by his wife that destroyed his dick.
04:07:54 It was his, what's the word?
04:07:58 His elective dupenus lengthening surgery, complications from it resulted in total dick destruction.
04:08:08 Why would you fucking, why would you play with fire after all that?
04:08:13 I know.
04:08:14 He was so close.
04:08:15 He must have felt invincible.
04:08:16 He was like, haha, nothing can destroy my dick.
04:08:18 If it lived through that, it can live through anything.
04:08:20 Foolish.
04:08:21 Foolish.
04:08:22 Like you could just take it off and then add another length of different penis and then stick the other one on.
04:08:29 Like you're building a block tower.
04:08:32 You got to get a donor.
04:08:34 You got to find someone with compatible blood type.
04:08:36 He'll donate most of their penis and you chop your dick.
04:08:40 Well, that's one way.
04:08:42 You could find a dick donor to chop off an inch of their dick to insert in yours, in the middle section.
04:08:48 Alternatively, I mean, why don't they just do, actually, it kind of is what they do.
04:08:54 When people like, the thing where they put the thing in their leg and it lengthens their leg bones.
04:08:59 That's kind of like jelking.
04:09:00 That's kind of like jelking their leg.
04:09:02 Jelking their bones.
04:09:03 Why don't they do that with their dick?
04:09:04 Why don't they put a freaking brace in their dick that they crank it every day and it lengthens their dick?
04:09:10 Because it's not a bone.
04:09:12 No.
04:09:14 It seems like it would actually be even easier to do if it wasn't a bone.
04:09:18 No, but like it's like soft tissue, soft tissue that stretched to a damaging degree would also heal.
04:09:26 Well, maybe.
04:09:28 I kind of feel like that.
04:09:30 I feel like if jelking works, that would work even better.
04:09:36 Super jelking.
04:09:37 A brace on your dick that you crank a little bit, you crank it a little bit every day.
04:09:43 You do that for like several months and you let it heal and your dick's longer at the end.
04:09:50 I don't know.
04:09:51 I don't see.
04:09:52 If jelking works, if leg lengthening works, why not on the dick?
04:09:57 Because I think it's the fact that the bone, when it grows back in smaller increments, it's more rigid.
04:10:07 It's a fixed thing.
04:10:09 Your bone can't shrink back to the size it was before because there's just more mass there and it's harder.
04:10:16 It's different.
04:10:17 I just feel like it's different than your penis.
04:10:24 That kind of makes sense.
04:10:26 You might be onto something.
04:10:27 Because the whole thing with the penis is that it's like a balloon.
04:10:31 It can shrink and then it can fill with blood.
04:10:35 Stretching it doesn't necessarily increase the area that the cells.
04:10:41 Maybe it rips certain things inside.
04:10:43 I feel like if you very slowly extended it with a brace, then at some point the tension of the stretch would be traumatic.
04:10:55 But if you very gradually increased that, the trauma would be introduced gradually and then it would heal.
04:11:03 It would heal itself while in that stretch state and it would heal itself with additional mass or length in order to close up the traumatic micro-fishers.
04:11:18 I don't know.
04:11:19 It's so fucked.
04:11:21 Get me a freaking doctor on the line.
04:11:24 Get me the freaking patent office.
04:11:25 Get me the Guinness Book of World Records for longest dick.
04:11:28 I'm going to have it soon.
04:11:29 I'm going to use my method.
04:11:30 Did you know, Ben, that you can apply like a gel, testosterone gel, and that makes your penis grow.
04:11:38 It's temporary, but they do that sometimes before.
04:11:43 Testosterone gel.
04:11:45 Yeah, because it's a hormone-based organ.
04:11:50 When you take estrogen, it shrinks a little bit and testosterone makes it grow.
04:11:58 Like how much?
04:11:59 I don't know how much exactly, but I've heard that before some trans women have the surgery to turn their penis into a vagina.
04:12:10 Oh, they put testosterone on it to make it bigger so it's easier to-
04:12:13 Yeah, because it makes more mass in the penis so that when you invert it,
04:12:19 it's deeper as a vagina because that's what they do.
04:12:24 Well, but hang on though, then wouldn't it shrink again afterwards?
04:12:29 I don't know.
04:12:30 I think once they tear it to shreds, it acts a little differently.
04:12:37 They cut it into sections and then invert it so that it's the linings of a vagina.
04:12:46 But like you said, it's a temporary increase, so the amount of mass-
04:12:51 I could understand if you made it bigger just so it's easier to manipulate surgically the pieces of it.
04:12:59 When I say it's temporary, I think what they mean is you add the hormone and it responds to the hormone,
04:13:09 but then it will revert to whatever level it was before.
04:13:13 I know, but that's what I'm saying.
04:13:15 Once it's been surgically changed, it no longer reacts to anything, it's just-
04:13:19 But it's the same tissue.
04:13:23 I don't know how it works.
04:13:25 I'm just saying I've heard that that's a thing that is done.
04:13:31 It makes sense.
04:13:33 I could see a surgeon just having an easier time chopping and slapping it, so to speak,
04:13:41 if it's just bigger.
04:13:43 It's more room to work with or whatever.
04:13:47 More specifically, I heard it was like changes the depth.
04:13:59 You don't have to rip it and tear it and crank it.
04:14:03 Put it in a freaking immersion blender.
04:14:06 Put it down the freaking garbage disposal.
04:14:12 I actually don't know what happens when a man takes extra testosterone.
04:14:16 It's probably not that good for them.
04:14:18 People do it, like older men do it, to maintain muscle mass, I think,
04:14:26 because I think when men get older, they produce less testosterone,
04:14:30 so I think older men supplement with it to keep themselves more muscular.
04:14:34 That's an old person thing just generally.
04:14:38 Yeah.
04:14:40 Just taking testosterone?
04:14:42 Even women?
04:14:44 No, I mean hormone production slows, so they need supplements.
04:14:48 Definitely.
04:14:50 I think some people do it.
04:14:54 I don't think it gives you any steroidal benefits.
04:15:00 I don't think if you just take extra testosterone, you get buffer or anything.
04:15:04 No.
04:15:06 Maybe you do that.
04:15:08 I think some people do take it, but I don't know if it has any benefits
04:15:12 unless you're already deficient.
04:15:18 There's one more voicemail.
04:15:20 Oh my god.
04:15:22 It's an image.
04:15:24 Here we go.
04:15:26 Can I mention the growing you'll be receiving?
04:15:32 Oh, this is AI upscaled?
04:15:36 We're just anime-ified.
04:15:40 These styles are so different.
04:15:42 These have got to be AI.
04:15:44 Yeah, yeah.
04:15:46 They're like four eye face.
04:15:50 Wait, is it?
04:15:52 I feel like the second image.
04:15:54 The second image, I mean, yeah, it's clearly weird.
04:15:58 Why did it interpret her having an arm pointing to you or the cat?
04:16:04 It's her tail, I think.
04:16:08 It's clearly just like struggling to interpret this figure.
04:16:12 It made it more legible, though.
04:16:14 It made it more sensical.
04:16:16 That's funny.
04:16:18 Yeah, I don't...
04:16:20 I don't know, the workings of it are mysterious to me.
04:16:24 Okay, this cake in the bottom,
04:16:28 I like the weird candy color fruit.
04:16:32 The blue raspberries?
04:16:35 It's like neon green something.
04:16:38 It's extremely fake looking fruits on this cake.
04:16:42 I want this cake, I want it.
04:16:45 The hand disappears.
04:16:48 The hand just disappears into the plate.
04:16:51 It struggles so much with the hands.
04:16:54 It works in the middle one because it just didn't bother giving them fingers.
04:16:58 Yeah.
04:17:00 How did it interpret me as a cat girl?
04:17:04 Okay, I think this is just an AI that is designed to turn anything into a cat girl.
04:17:09 I think that's what this is.
04:17:11 Yeah, it's odd, I'm not sure.
04:17:13 I have not seen this before.
04:17:15 The face in the first one just rules.
04:17:19 Like both faces?
04:17:21 In the first one up top, my big polygonal mouth.
04:17:25 Yeah, that's artistic.
04:17:27 That's awesome.
04:17:29 But then the girl is like an alien, like a bug person.
04:17:33 This is what's good about AI interpolation,
04:17:38 is when it just makes some fucking weird shit.
04:17:43 Bizarre.
04:17:45 I like how on the bottom one,
04:17:47 they've turned you into a big booby anime lady,
04:17:50 but they've also, where your hand is, they've just drawn a circle.
04:17:53 Because they don't know what that is.
04:17:55 What is that?
04:17:57 What does it think that is?
04:17:59 Like another person's head?
04:18:01 Is that some boob poking out of a hole in the fabric?
04:18:04 I don't think so.
04:18:06 Does it just turn my hand into a hole?
04:18:08 It just turns your hand into a-
04:18:10 Hand like a hole!
04:18:12 It turns your soul.
04:18:14 And it's got a little bit of hair.
04:18:16 Wait, wait.
04:18:18 Or is that the hair from the top?
04:18:20 I think that's just...
04:18:22 Well, I mean, to me, that just reads as my long hair
04:18:25 kind of going down my back.
04:18:27 I like that it...
04:18:29 Like what is it, that middle cake?
04:18:31 Where did that middle cake come from?
04:18:34 I wonder if it's like saying,
04:18:36 oh, there's cake here, therefore there's cake everywhere.
04:18:39 Therefore, anything else, we must interpret it as cake.
04:18:45 Yeah, but why?
04:18:47 There's nothing under your hand that could be a cake.
04:18:50 Yeah, there's nothing there.
04:18:52 There's just a little bit of white, and it's like,
04:18:54 well, it must be some cake.
04:18:56 He must be reaching for some cake.
04:19:00 Also, why is the cat has blue hair in the middle one?
04:19:03 Why did they give the cat blue hair?
04:19:05 They gave the cat purple hair.
04:19:08 There's weird logic at play.
04:19:10 And it's also weird because the perspective
04:19:15 is slightly different, and...
04:19:18 Well, maybe not that different.
04:19:20 Actually, the lines on the floor are very similar,
04:19:22 but you, as a cat person, are a lot closer
04:19:25 than the image of you.
04:19:28 Why did they notice that you are a figure there
04:19:31 and then increase your size to be closer?
04:19:36 Yeah, it's like taking the image
04:19:42 and it's like recognizing figures,
04:19:44 and then it's like creating new figures on top of them,
04:19:48 but in a way that distorts it towards some ideal,
04:19:54 towards some specific sort of image
04:19:58 that it wants to make out of anything.
04:20:02 I don't know.
04:20:05 It just thinks that the figure should be closer.
04:20:11 I can't...
04:20:12 I'm trying to make sense of it.
04:20:14 Your cat face is so fucked.
04:20:16 It looks like it's Uboa.
04:20:18 It's Uboa.
04:20:19 Uboa?
04:20:20 Yeah, you know the...
04:20:22 Hang on.
04:20:24 From Yumi Nikki.
04:20:27 Yumi Nikki.
04:20:30 It's this...
04:20:32 Oh, yeah, a little bit.
04:20:35 Yeah, Uboa cat.
04:20:39 That's me.
04:20:41 This image is titled Not So Pog,
04:20:44 but it's a little pog.
04:20:45 Yeah, it's pretty pog.
04:20:46 I am pogging a bit, actually.
04:20:50 Also, okay, the first one,
04:20:52 look at my eyebrow.
04:20:54 Look at what it gave me for my eyebrow forehead.
04:20:58 Yeah, it's like...
04:20:59 It gave me like a huge caveman brow.
04:21:03 Perfect.
04:21:04 You got like curly hair coming down.
04:21:06 Yeah.
04:21:08 I kind of look like a Pokemon trainer.
04:21:11 Yeah, like a Pokemon trainer or a professor.
04:21:14 Yeah.
04:21:16 But also with like crazy freaking like color swatches
04:21:20 for my eye holes.
04:21:23 I'm having fun.
04:21:24 This is a fun generation.
04:21:29 Love it.
04:21:31 Very confusing.
04:21:34 Makes me just gotta say...
04:21:36 All I can do is speculate and wonder why.
04:21:38 Why did it...
04:21:40 Why did this have to happen?
04:21:41 Oh, okay.
04:21:42 Last thing...
04:21:45 Yeah, it turned the mall
04:21:47 into like a traditional Japanese like dojo.
04:21:50 It's got like the sliding Japanese doors.
04:21:52 Yeah.
04:21:54 It's just like making everything into Japanese cat girls, this one.
04:21:57 Like that must be like specifically what this one is for.
04:22:01 Maybe this is not just put the image in and it'll interpret it.
04:22:05 Maybe the person added things like an explanation to go along with it.
04:22:11 Or maybe just like with the cake, right?
04:22:13 It recognized that there was cake and so it added more cake in other places.
04:22:17 Maybe it recognized the cat ears on the one girl
04:22:20 and so it just gave everyone cat ears.
04:22:22 Yeah, that's probably what I thought.
04:22:25 Also, the cat girl in the middle has three ears.
04:22:29 Yes, I noticed that.
04:22:31 She's got the two black ones and the one blue one.
04:22:34 Like it didn't quite know which angle to go with.
04:22:37 So it just went with both.
04:22:44 Delightful.
04:22:45 Yeah.
04:22:46 That's the end of the voicemails.
04:22:49 All right.
04:22:53 Wow, is it nearly, is it nearly fucking February?
04:22:58 If there's a week and change left.
04:23:02 When this episode's out, it'll be the 27th.
04:23:05 That's right.
04:23:06 Crazy.
04:23:08 That's 30.
04:23:09 Yeah.
04:23:11 I should, you know, I know I said this last month,
04:23:15 but I should really try to get that book done by the end of this month.
04:23:18 And I should actually do it this time.
04:23:21 And every time I say that, it gets more and more likely that it will happen,
04:23:25 that this will be the month.
04:23:27 So you're playing the slots, you're rolling the dice again.
04:23:32 Every single, every single time, every time.
04:23:34 And one of these days it's going to pay out.
04:23:37 One of these days it's going to pay out.
04:23:39 Just like crypto.
04:23:41 Just like crypto.
04:23:42 You know, I'm sad to say Bitcoin had a big day yesterday.
04:23:47 It like jumped up like 30%.
04:23:51 Jumped up, jumped up and got down.
04:23:54 It went down a little bit, but like, yeah, it had a big,
04:23:59 like a 30% jump yesterday.
04:24:01 And I hate that.
04:24:02 It makes me upset.
04:24:04 I got a fucking notification from one of the apps I was using
04:24:07 that I had put money in a long time ago.
04:24:10 And it said, you've got like a few days left,
04:24:13 final chance to take your cash out because the app is not going to exist.
04:24:17 I'm like, oh, okay, cash out please.
04:24:21 So that should be...
04:24:22 Did you do that?
04:24:24 Well, I hope you did it after this jump.
04:24:28 That's like 30%.
04:24:29 It wasn't in Bitcoin.
04:24:30 I think the app, I had specifically got it to put some in Dogecoin,
04:24:35 just because Dogecoin at the time was going insane.
04:24:38 And I just missed it.
04:24:39 I was like, dang.
04:24:40 Well, maybe next time and I never happened.
04:24:42 Well, these cryptos tend to like rise and fall together.
04:24:46 Like...
04:24:47 Yeah.
04:24:48 Yeah.
04:24:49 Ethereum also jumped up yesterday.
04:24:52 I just took everything out.
04:24:53 I think overall, like the money I put in, I think I put 200 pounds in
04:24:58 and I took out 283 pounds.
04:25:00 So it's not a big jump, but like it's not a loss.
04:25:03 So fuck it.
04:25:04 I'm not paying attention to those apps anymore.
04:25:07 Dogecoin rose yesterday, but only a little bit.
04:25:11 Yeah.
04:25:12 Um, frickin...
04:25:15 Dick Masterson just came out with like...
04:25:18 Okay.
04:25:20 I guess there's...
04:25:21 He had his like, quote unquote, Patreon alternative, which is just...
04:25:27 He manages your money for you.
04:25:30 And he just said...
04:25:31 He's announced a new one that's like that, but it's crypto.
04:25:36 Well, and I don't know, it just seems so stupid.
04:25:40 It just seems like, first of all, he already had one.
04:25:43 First of all, he already could just do it himself.
04:25:46 So I don't see what the benefit to this new one is...
04:25:50 Unless you already are in crypto.
04:25:53 If you have crypto, it's the same as the old one.
04:25:57 But if you don't, then it's just the old...
04:26:00 I think it was called New Project 2.
04:26:02 It's just that, but you have to invest in crypto before you can participate in it.
04:26:09 And I just don't fucking...
04:26:11 I just don't get it.
04:26:13 What was the idea with New Project 2?
04:26:15 Well, the idea is that some creators and some people were banned off Patreon and stuff.
04:26:21 And basically, Dick...
04:26:23 Pretty much all it was was like, people could just pledge to New Project 2
04:26:29 instead of pledging to Patreon.
04:26:31 And that's just the same as sending your money to Dick.
04:26:34 And then Dick just gives these people...
04:26:37 He pays them out.
04:26:38 He's basically functioning as Patreon for these people who were banned from Patreon.
04:26:43 That's pretty much the gist of it.
04:26:45 Which is fine, I guess.
04:26:49 Yeah, and the new one is just that, but crypto.
04:26:53 Awesome.
04:26:56 Stupid.
04:26:58 Crypted.
04:27:00 More like, more like, crypt off.
04:27:03 Get it?
04:27:05 No.
04:27:06 You get ripped off.
04:27:07 Oh, crypt off.
04:27:08 I get it.
04:27:09 That's good.
04:27:10 Yeah, yeah, thanks.
04:27:16 Next week, I won't be depressed anymore.
04:27:19 Mm-hmm.
04:27:20 Hello.
04:27:21 Well, is that true or is that a lie?
04:27:23 Find out next time.
04:27:24 Find out next time.
04:27:25 Find out.
04:27:26 Only one way to find out.
04:27:28 Next time, my book will be done.
04:27:30 That's...
04:27:32 Yeah.
04:27:34 It could happen.
04:27:37 Next time, I make no promises.
04:27:41 All I'm doing is existing.
04:27:43 You should make promises and then just break them.
04:27:47 No, what's the point?
04:27:49 What's the point of saying, oh, I should work on that and then not doing it?
04:27:53 Maybe I should just forego the saying, I'll do it.
04:27:57 Hmm.
04:27:59 Well, that's not very Sigma grind set of you.
04:28:08 I feel like something has to change with my, I don't know, situation slash attitude slash mental state.
04:28:20 Yeah.
04:28:21 Before I can really, because I don't know.
04:28:26 This is like Clarissa, that's the thing hanging over my head.
04:28:29 There's still some other things.
04:28:31 Mm-hmm.
04:28:32 I'm like, got to do it.
04:28:34 Yeah.
04:28:35 I want it.
04:28:36 I genuinely don't want to do anything.
04:28:39 You're saying you need a change in your outlook, mental state, attitude, what have you, before you can get that done is what you're saying.
04:28:52 I don't know.
04:28:53 I think it may also be a mistake to be waiting or, you know, hoping for something to change before I do anything.
04:29:02 To, I don't know.
04:29:04 I'm just sort of like, I'm numb right now.
04:29:06 I'm numb to everything.
04:29:09 I just sort of like enjoying like media and feeling mostly nothing.
04:29:15 And it's like, you know, whatever.
04:29:18 Okay.
04:29:19 I think it was a while ago, and I think I showed it on the show, but I posted, I guess you could call it a meme.
04:29:25 But it was a bunch of like, it was sort of like art, like it was kind of self-healthy, but not really.
04:29:34 It was sort of like memes or like jokes about like, it was basically like comparing like two different ways to like look at the same thing.
04:29:43 And I don't remember what all of them were.
04:29:45 But do you remember the one, it was like, the artist is like looking at the blank page.
04:29:51 And in the one panel, he says like, he says like, I'll work on this when I feel better.
04:30:02 And then in the other one, he says, if I work on this, I will feel better.
04:30:06 Do you know what I mean?
04:30:08 Yeah.
04:30:09 I think if you're troubled, I know it's hard, I know it's hard to get yourself out of a rut.
04:30:14 But if you're troubled by the fact that you haven't worked on a thing, then probably you might have to simply force yourself to do it, even if you don't feel like it.
04:30:23 And you might find that in doing so, that that's the only way to push past that.
04:30:29 Yeah.
04:30:30 It's just a tip for you.
04:30:33 It's just a little nudge, because it sounds like what you might need to hear.
04:30:39 I don't know, because I mean, probably, I'm not discounting that advice.
04:30:48 But I did try to force myself, I guess it was a few months ago now.
04:30:56 And I did get a bit of work done.
04:30:58 And then I immediately was like, that sucked.
04:31:01 I don't want to do anymore.
04:31:03 So it didn't make me feel better.
04:31:06 And I don't know.
04:31:09 At the moment, I'm just sort of like, what if, you know, fuck everything?
04:31:13 What if all the things I do, like that doesn't matter?
04:31:18 Just fuck them.
04:31:20 I'm genuinely at a point like that.
04:31:22 And I don't really know how I feel about it.
04:31:26 Well, I mean, it sounds like you just told me how you feel about it.
04:31:30 Well, I don't know.
04:31:31 You're like, fuck it.
04:31:32 I guess so.
04:31:34 It's kind of sad though.
04:31:39 And that's the end of the show.
04:31:42 No, I get you.
04:31:43 No, I get you.
04:31:46 I don't know.
04:31:48 My light at the end of the tunnel right now is the book is done.
04:31:53 And I can kickstart it.
04:31:56 So I mean, I've got that going for me.
04:31:58 If I didn't have that, I don't know what I would do.
04:32:04 I would feel very little motivation.
04:32:07 I guess I'm just sort of feeling like the things I do don't really matter to anyone that much.
04:32:14 And so like, if I finally get closer to chapter four done, like, it's whatever.
04:32:21 Like, it doesn't excite me.
04:32:23 And that's annoying.
04:32:25 No, I don't feel like anything I'm doing is exciting.
04:32:29 I definitely feel, I know exactly what you mean, but I don't know what advice I have to offer about that.
04:32:39 Because I know all too well that, yeah, I don't know.
04:32:48 I guess you got to just step back and look at the big picture and appreciate.
04:32:55 I mean, there's one of two options.
04:32:57 Either the thing is worth doing, in which case you could step back and consider and take a broader perspective and see,
04:33:03 no, I should do that because it will have, because I will be glad that I did.
04:33:09 Or, I mean, I guess you might look at it objectively and you might conclude,
04:33:14 and I'm not saying this about Clarissa.
04:33:16 I'm just saying this about endeavors in general.
04:33:18 You might be like, no, that's not worth doing.
04:33:20 What I'm not excited about it is because it's a waste of time and I should do something else.
04:33:25 You know, those are the only two possibilities.
04:33:30 Yeah.
04:33:35 Yeah, I didn't really want to bring it up earlier because I didn't really have a robust thought about any of it.
04:33:42 It's just sort of like, wow, I really am in a malaise right now.
04:33:49 I guess we'll see what happens.
04:33:52 You know what?
04:33:54 I mean, yeah, me too.
04:33:55 I also didn't get too much into it before.
04:33:58 I kind of just let it go, but it's good.
04:34:04 Honestly, if you had gotten on this, if you had wanted to talk about your malaise,
04:34:11 I probably would have started talking about my malaise and then we just would have had a malaise cast.
04:34:16 Yeah.
04:34:17 Next time.
04:34:18 No, next time.
04:34:19 That's the teaser for the next episode.
04:34:22 Right.
04:34:23 I mean, I don't mind.
04:34:28 Do you want to wrap up or do you want to explore this more deeply?
04:34:34 I feel like we've gone on.
04:34:35 We've had a full episode at this point.
04:34:37 Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
04:34:39 I don't know what I would say.
04:34:41 I feel like my work has been good generally, like my body of work.
04:34:47 Yeah.
04:34:48 But I don't know.
04:34:50 I don't feel like doing it right now.
04:34:53 That's it.
04:34:55 That's where my mind is.
04:34:57 No.
04:34:59 If I damn, I wish I knew the solution to that problem because that would help me also.
04:35:07 And I'm trying to think about it from the point of view of like,
04:35:11 what would I tell someone else who feels that way?
04:35:15 Because kind of that's sort of how you have to, when you have a problem,
04:35:20 sometimes it helps to think about what would I tell someone else that came to me
04:35:23 and they described a similar problem.
04:35:26 And what you're describing to me is a similar problem to what I think about.
04:35:30 And now I'm like, well, can I think of something that I would tell someone with that problem?
04:35:36 No.
04:35:38 I have nothing, no solutions to offer.
04:35:43 But let's think about it.
04:35:46 Let's contemplate.
04:35:49 Maybe next week we'll think of something.
04:35:53 Yeah.
04:35:54 We'll have the answers.
04:35:57 All right, you want to wrap up?
04:35:59 Yeah.
04:36:01 Do you?
04:36:03 I don't know.
04:36:05 It would have been cool if you had the perfect thing to say and I'm like, oh my god.
04:36:09 I know.
04:36:10 That would have ruled so much.
04:36:13 I would have been the man.
04:36:17 My therapist told me you should try to create something.
04:36:22 Even if it's not good.
04:36:25 I think Clarissa, I want it to be good so I'm not doing it because I don't think it's good enough.
04:36:31 That's one aspect.
04:36:33 Your therapist said you should try to create something.
04:36:36 Was that her specific advice for you or in general?
04:36:40 For me because I'm a creative person.
04:36:42 I'm obviously in the past have been very passionate about certain things because I'm depressed at the moment.
04:36:48 I'm sort of closing off.
04:36:51 I'm not with it.
04:36:57 If art is fun, creating things is fun, then I should try to do something that I want to do.
04:37:04 Even if it's bad, even if nobody wants to see it, even if I will never show it to anyone.
04:37:11 I was like, okay.
04:37:13 That's some sort of actionable advice.
04:37:15 Try and work on something that I want to do and then I was thinking about it and I don't want to do anything.
04:37:20 That was the roadblock.
04:37:22 I'm like, well fuck.
04:37:24 I don't have a single thing that I'm interested in doing right now.
04:37:29 I don't know.
04:37:33 Yeah.
04:37:35 If I need to reignite a spark of motivation or passion, I don't know how to do it.
04:37:47 Sometimes somebody will ask me about the next chapter of the champion or the vapors or something.
04:37:55 Generally, my answer is like, yeah, in general I'd like to do another one of those, but I don't have a story that's in my head right now that's like, I know what I'm going to do.
04:38:09 I know what it's going to be and I want to do it.
04:38:13 It's like, I would need to really have, yeah, like a specific thing I want to make, like a specific story that I want to tell.
04:38:25 I can't imagine, like to motivate myself to do that.
04:38:29 I can't imagine.
04:38:31 You know, mangaka, they're working on a freaking deadline every week.
04:38:37 Every week they got to come up with some new bullshit for their characters to do or whatever.
04:38:43 Can you fucking imagine?
04:38:45 I can't.
04:38:47 I mean, I can hardly think of anything.
04:38:50 I can think of that being like a good recipe for like continued ability to work.
04:38:57 Like if there's a deadline, well, you've got to draw something.
04:39:00 And if you've got to draw something, then even if you don't have a good idea, you'll just throw something out.
04:39:06 And that's like a, I don't need to, I don't really need to worry so much about everything being perfect.
04:39:16 Sometimes a chapter is kind of lame.
04:39:18 I mean, it doesn't have one piece, but he's very, very well like honed that craft over the decades.
04:39:28 And he's got a lot of ideas that he's already written down.
04:39:31 But like for some mangaka, they have off weeks.
04:39:36 Sometimes you can tell.
04:39:39 Where it's just, so I don't know.
04:39:44 I need to maybe just make Clarissa chapter four, even if it sucks and then put it up there and maybe I'll feel better.
04:39:52 But yeah, no deadline and no like, no nothing.
04:39:58 This makes it difficult.
04:40:00 Yeah, this is kind of a depressing thought that I have a bunch of the time.
04:40:05 But I wonder if like, hey, if I like worked for a magazine or something, if I worked for Shonen Jump or something like that.
04:40:14 And I was like, okay, I need to make a chapter because I need to fill my quota.
04:40:21 I need to, because it's my job and I got to do it.
04:40:24 So I do it.
04:40:27 I don't know.
04:40:29 Would I, you know.
04:40:32 Just makes me wonder like, what would I have done?
04:40:35 What would I have done if that was my situation?
04:40:38 Like what work could I have done under those circumstances that I haven't and never will now because that was not true?
04:40:50 That really makes me sad.
04:40:56 Well, that's the show everybody.
04:40:59 What if we made like a like a procrastinator's jump?
04:41:03 Little little manga magazine, the weekly this and then we would put we would put like a the latest chapter of Clarissa and or any other comic or whatever.
04:41:17 I don't know if I have the, I don't know if I have the chops to do anything weekly like that.
04:41:25 I mean, neither do I really, but maybe not weekly, but I think some sort of structure would help me in my situation.
04:41:38 Yeah, the moment it's it feels like the the barriers to Clarissa existing are my own feeling that what I'm doing is for a good reason.
04:41:50 Like people care about Clarissa and want to see and I know people do.
04:41:53 People have told me they want to see, but like, I want it to be good.
04:41:59 And so, yeah, I don't feel like I'm good enough.
04:42:05 But I don't know what if I had a deadline, what if I had to make it?
04:42:13 I mean, that's how I made the first few bunches of pages because of the Tezuka thing.
04:42:18 It was a very hard deadline.
04:42:20 You had to have the comic ready by this time.
04:42:23 Otherwise, it would not be submitted.
04:42:29 True.
04:42:33 You're on you're on to something.
04:42:35 You're probably right.
04:42:46 What would you contribute to a weekly one piece, a weekly manga magazine on the procrastinators brand?
04:42:56 God.
04:43:01 Obviously, you got different types of projects.
04:43:06 That's genuinely like a scary question.
04:43:10 That would be if like, I feel like I would be going over a cliff to like hard commit to doing any such thing.
04:43:19 This feels like I'm asking to fail.
04:43:24 I mean, yeah, it's going to suck.
04:43:27 Yeah.
04:43:28 The only thing that is like makes sense to me is that if I try, if I try to make it, it's going to be bad.
04:43:34 Well, it's I know that I'll be able to make it.
04:43:37 It'll just be bad and people will say, oh, this sucks.
04:43:41 They'll spit upon my grave, but at least I'll make it.
04:43:44 It would be it would be Biscopades.
04:43:46 I would pick up Biscopades again and finish and go do that until it was done.
04:43:54 Yeah, that's actually it's an easy answer.
04:43:58 Yeah, we should make we should make a little.
04:44:00 What's the name?
04:44:01 What's a good name?
04:44:02 Shonen Jump.
04:44:05 We don't really want to copy jump, but yeah, something.
04:44:13 I'm trying to think of like a pun with PCP or procrastination.
04:44:20 Pro comics.
04:44:22 Pro comics publication.
04:44:27 Based.
04:44:29 Epic win.
04:44:34 You there?
04:44:36 No, I'm just thinking.
04:44:38 No, that was my serious.
04:44:40 My serious answer.
04:44:41 PCP.
04:44:42 Wait, wasn't that like a thing in like that's the whole like backman thing.
04:44:46 The pro crime.
04:44:47 Yeah, well, the perfect crime party.
04:44:49 Yes.
04:44:50 Yes.
04:44:51 Perfect comic park tea.
04:44:53 Perfect.
04:44:54 Honestly, yeah, perfect comic party is not bad.
04:44:57 We're the procrastinators.
04:44:59 We have a show called the PCP in a comic called the PCP.
04:45:03 No confusing at all.
04:45:05 And our acronym is TPC.
04:45:14 All right.
04:45:15 I feel like that's worth submitting to the board.
04:45:20 I feel like honest, you know what?
04:45:22 Honestly, you know what?
04:45:24 Honestly, it's a little bit scary, but I could honestly, I could do.
04:45:31 I feel like that'd be better.
04:45:33 Something like that.
04:45:34 I don't know.
04:45:35 It would need a little bit of infrastructure, but I would feel better doing it like that
04:45:37 than just fucking posted my shit on Twitter.
04:45:40 Posting Biscopades on Twitter was like depressing.
04:45:43 This shitty platform for such a thing.
04:45:47 But I have like no audience on like Tapas or Webtoon.
04:45:51 So that was even shittier there.
04:45:53 Yeah.
04:45:55 Okay.
04:45:56 This is cute then.
04:45:57 We can have a little cute little comic.
04:45:58 It is cute.
04:45:59 I guess we'll draw the comics and then put them together in like a PDF or some sort of
04:46:06 way people can read it and then link the PDF.
04:46:10 It's like, oh, it's the new episode.
04:46:11 It's the new thing.
04:46:13 Maybe fans could like write articles.
04:46:17 Maybe the, what's the RFCK news?
04:46:24 Where'd that go, huh?
04:46:26 Oh, the Slime Times?
04:46:29 Slime Times.
04:46:30 You could have a Slime Times article.
04:46:32 Just spitballing.
04:46:34 Obviously, initially, it'll just be me and you.
04:46:36 I think we'd better, on the one hand, like a downloadable PDF is cuter.
04:46:42 But I mean, Beescapades is GIFs.
04:46:44 Beescapades was like in a GIF format.
04:46:46 So it couldn't exist as a PDF.
04:46:49 Yeah, that's the truth.
04:46:51 Although, I guess it wouldn't have to be GIFs.
04:46:56 This is not that essential a part of it.
04:46:59 Maybe you could just link like, hey, this new episode.
04:47:03 Could just be an HTML website.
04:47:07 Just be a web page.
04:47:09 A web page.
04:47:12 Like, I want it to be cute.
04:47:15 It could better just be a zip file.
04:47:17 Could you be a zip file with images in it?
04:47:19 It could be.
04:47:21 I just like the cute little idea of it having a cover with a barcode
04:47:27 and all those things they have on a comic book you would buy.
04:47:32 And the big old title, name of comic but cool looking
04:47:38 with our characters doing like a shonen jump.
04:47:41 Oh, look, this one's got Clarissa in it and Beescapades.
04:47:45 Oh, my God.
04:47:47 My two favorite characters, Clarissa and Beescapades.
04:47:52 His name is the Beast Hustler.
04:47:55 If I even remember correctly, and I do.
04:47:59 And it could be like a little weekly comic.
04:48:03 I could do a Redman comic for it as well.
04:48:06 Oh, right.
04:48:08 Redman.
04:48:10 Yeah, that's the funny.
04:48:11 So that's the funny is at the end.
04:48:15 Do you have still have a bunch of Redman queued up
04:48:17 or did you finish those?
04:48:19 I finished those.
04:48:20 I could just make border.
04:48:22 True.
04:48:23 I think I prefer making it on the spur of the moment
04:48:25 and posting it rather than making a ton of them in one go
04:48:28 and then queuing them because like some of the jokes
04:48:30 just don't land when I write a bunch of them in one go.
04:48:34 Although sometimes that is how I wrote them
04:48:37 because I just thought of something funny until I had a good one.
04:48:41 But yeah, I could do a Redman comic.
04:48:45 Those don't take much.
04:48:47 I would just need to finish the next Clarissa gun smoke.
04:48:52 I wonder how long, I wonder how I could do,
04:48:55 maybe if I said like one day a week aside,
04:48:58 I could do a few panels of Biscopades a week
04:49:01 and it probably wouldn't even be that hard.
04:49:06 You know, I feel pretty good.
04:49:09 I really did want to finish that,
04:49:12 but I've just had so many other things that I have popped up
04:49:15 that I've been like, I have to do this first,
04:49:17 I have to do that first.
04:49:19 I think this is good because...
04:49:21 I have to spend five months making a Mega Man video.
04:49:24 I think this is good because it pulls on those collaborative strings,
04:49:33 those collaborative heart strings,
04:49:35 that got me so into like making videos, like pony videos.
04:49:41 That's what I was going to say.
04:49:42 No, I was working with people,
04:49:43 but I was working with people in tandem
04:49:46 to make a review of the new My Little Pony episode.
04:49:50 That's what I was going to say.
04:49:53 And so like instead of...
04:49:55 Like I have to deliver.
04:49:57 Yeah, but instead of making the same comic,
04:50:00 we're making those same product in the magazine.
04:50:07 You know what?
04:50:08 I kind of like it.
04:50:09 Using our comics.
04:50:10 The more I think about it, the better an idea I think it is.
04:50:15 The perfect comic party.
04:50:20 I like that.
04:50:22 It's a callback.
04:50:24 It's a callback.
04:50:25 All the way back to the roots.
04:50:29 Then...
04:50:30 Okay.
04:50:31 We should call it one piece.
04:50:36 That's the one place.
04:50:38 All the comics are in one place.
04:50:41 I left all of the good comics in one piece.
04:50:44 It's exactly like that Imgirlink.
04:50:48 You can read my comic,
04:50:49 but you'll have to find it first.
04:50:53 We add like a comic from Jennifer and Jen.
04:50:59 We should just steal...
04:51:03 Yeah, we should just steal that.
04:51:04 We should just steal Jennifer's show
04:51:06 and just put it in and pretend she's a contributor
04:51:08 and not tell anyone.
04:51:13 Yeah.
04:51:15 I dig it.
04:51:17 I think I'm in.
04:51:19 And we could put Fana,
04:51:21 that appears on the Progress Natives podcast.
04:51:24 Oh, true.
04:51:26 Or Fana just appears.
04:51:28 Where would we publish it?
04:51:30 Well, we have a Twitter account for the channel.
04:51:33 We can put it on the freaking...
04:51:35 We have a freaking WordPress.
04:51:37 Oh, we do.
04:51:38 Yeah.
04:51:39 Which I've been meaning to update
04:51:40 and I keep telling people I'll update,
04:51:42 and I haven't done it in like three months,
04:51:44 maybe longer.
04:51:46 Well...
04:51:48 Okay, so making a PDF
04:51:50 is something that I know how to do,
04:51:52 I think, pretty simple.
04:51:54 But with Biscopay's GIFs,
04:51:57 do you want to make a version of Biscopay's
04:51:59 that would appear in the magazine,
04:52:01 or do you not like the PDF idea?
04:52:07 Because otherwise it's like a series of web pages
04:52:10 that you click through to the next one.
04:52:12 That's like PDF better.
04:52:14 It's a file.
04:52:17 Honestly, I don't...
04:52:20 I don't really care that much about
04:52:22 discarding the GIF format.
04:52:26 Maybe...
04:52:28 Maybe if there's like something I really wanted to animate,
04:52:31 I could just have like a clickable link in the PDF
04:52:33 that would link to a website
04:52:35 that displays the GIF or something.
04:52:37 Yeah, I think if you can do that,
04:52:39 if you can have links in PDFs,
04:52:41 then you can just link to where...
04:52:43 You can host it on St. Connex,
04:52:45 and you can just link from the PDF to it.
04:52:47 Yeah.
04:52:48 Maybe the same for me.
04:52:49 Yeah.
04:52:50 But I'll also put it in the PDF.
04:52:56 Alright, fuck it, I'm in.
04:52:58 Alright.
04:52:59 This is fun.
04:53:01 Yeah.
04:53:02 We'll post it on the WordPress.
04:53:04 I'll update the WordPress.
04:53:06 I'll get it up to date.
04:53:08 Yeah.
04:53:09 We'll think of a logo.
04:53:11 Maybe some...
04:53:13 Maybe we can steal...
04:53:15 We can steal someone's logo.
04:53:17 Someone submits a flag.
04:53:19 Someone submits a purple and green flag.
04:53:21 It's got to be purple and teal,
04:53:23 and it's got to have a skull.
04:53:27 And that's it.
04:53:28 Jump Comics, PCP,
04:53:30 Perfect Crime Party.
04:53:31 We just copied their logo
04:53:34 that they used for the fake...
04:53:37 One of these.
04:53:39 Do they have a logo? Let me see.
04:53:41 Oh, that's just letters.
04:53:43 That's dog shit.
04:53:45 Yeah.
04:53:46 It sucks.
04:53:48 I mean, we could just take that
04:53:50 and make it better and make the colors
04:53:53 fascinating.
04:53:55 I like...
04:53:56 I just...
04:53:57 It's amusing seeing them hold a phone
04:53:59 saying PCP like they're listening to it.
04:54:01 They are listening to the...
04:54:02 Excuse me, darling.
04:54:03 I'm listening to the PCP right now.
04:54:06 It's so interesting.
04:54:10 It's just so funny how many times
04:54:12 it says PCP on this cover.
04:54:16 PCP. PCP.
04:54:18 PCP. Yeah, three times.
04:54:20 Perfect Crime Party in the back.
04:54:27 We can have guest contributors.
04:54:29 Yeah.
04:54:30 People can contribute if they're...
04:54:32 Maybe Cheesy wants to put one of their comics
04:54:34 in the magazine.
04:54:36 Sure.
04:54:37 A new alien girlfriend.
04:54:39 Sure.
04:54:40 Or just...
04:54:41 I mean, I was just thinking like...
04:54:43 Any old fucking idiot
04:54:45 sends this shit.
04:54:46 Any old fucking loser.
04:54:48 Any fucking loser.
04:54:49 I mean, it would...
04:54:50 Little scribbler, little scribe.
04:54:51 It'd have to be a little bit good.
04:54:53 It'd have to be decent, but...
04:54:55 Nah, we'll do it like the voicemails.
04:54:57 Any old shit.
04:54:59 You know what? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
04:55:01 You're right. You're right.
04:55:02 Open it up in submissions.
04:55:04 No submit...
04:55:05 No approval process.
04:55:06 Just anyone...
04:55:10 It has to be a comic.
04:55:11 That's the only rule.
04:55:14 Okay.
04:55:17 Single panel comics.
04:55:18 Based.
04:55:19 Like Beast Capades are allowed.
04:55:22 Yeah.
04:55:24 Cause you got like...
04:55:25 A panel and then text under.
04:55:27 My...
04:55:29 Page size...
04:55:31 The Clarissa and Beast Capades
04:55:33 have different page sizes.
04:55:35 But...
04:55:36 I mean, whatever.
04:55:39 Yeah, I was assuming it'd be like...
04:55:41 Two...
04:55:42 Two panels per page or something.
04:55:45 Yeah, you could figure that out.
04:55:47 Figure it out, yeah.
04:55:51 Hey, that feels good.
04:55:52 Hey.
04:55:53 It's good.
04:55:54 Feeling good about it.
04:55:55 Yeah.
04:55:56 Shuffed.
04:55:57 Nice job.
04:55:58 Hey, nice job.
04:55:59 Nice job.
04:56:00 Thanks.
04:56:01 Hey, thanks for offering solutions.
04:56:03 Instead of just wallowing.
04:56:06 Yeah, it's funny.
04:56:07 Cause like I feel...
04:56:08 I feel in the same like...
04:56:11 Area of depression.
04:56:13 But I don't feel like wallowing.
04:56:15 I just feel like nothing.
04:56:16 But this was like easy to think of.
04:56:19 Like yeah, that could be fun.
04:56:20 Wow.
04:56:21 Yeah, let's fucking do it.
04:56:22 It's very impressive.
04:56:24 I'm so smart.
04:56:25 You're very smart.
04:56:26 Thank you.
04:56:27 You did a great...
04:56:28 You did a good job.
04:56:31 But I mean it though.
04:56:34 Alright, let's do it.
04:56:35 Let's make it happen.
04:56:36 We'll work on it.
04:56:37 We'll workshop it.
04:56:39 And that's the episode of the
04:56:41 Procrastinators podcast.
04:56:42 That's the episode of the Procrastinators podcast.
04:56:44 Become a patron.
04:56:45 Wait, shit.
04:56:46 We should make a patron exclusive.
04:56:48 Oh, but I don't want to.
04:56:50 No, I don't care about that.
04:56:52 I'm gonna make my comic...
04:56:54 I'm gonna make my comic like free anyway.
04:56:57 Ah, fuck.
04:56:59 Yeah, me too.
04:57:00 This is a motivational tool.
04:57:01 This is not a money-making scheme.
04:57:04 Yeah.
04:57:06 Fine.
04:57:08 Alright.
04:57:11 I'll make...
04:57:12 I'll have to make money some other way.
04:57:14 Like a chump.
04:57:16 Maybe...
04:57:17 Alright, how about this?
04:57:18 Patron exclusive benefit.
04:57:21 You get to be one of the supporters in the comic.
04:57:25 In the magazine.
04:57:26 Yeah, that's true.
04:57:27 Support a page.
04:57:28 See, that's true.
04:57:29 A thank you page.
04:57:30 You know, why not?
04:57:31 We can do thank you pages.
04:57:34 It's not a bad idea.
04:57:36 Yeah, okay.
04:57:37 That makes sense.
04:57:38 The coolest members are...
04:57:41 This guy.
04:57:42 This guy.
04:57:43 They will be ranked in terms of money.
04:57:45 Yeah.
04:57:46 Yeah.
04:57:47 Alright.
04:57:48 Good.
04:57:49 It's all coming together.
04:57:51 I don't know how to make a PDF.
04:57:54 That's okay.
04:57:55 I'll be in charge of making the PDF.
04:57:58 Okay.
04:57:59 We should work together on the logo and stuff.
04:58:03 Alright.
04:58:04 I'll think about it.
04:58:05 I'll work on it.
04:58:07 Yeah.
04:58:08 Alright.
04:58:09 Sick.
04:58:10 Sick.
04:58:11 Exciting.
04:58:12 Exciting stuff.
04:58:15 It's all work on the next chapter to get it ready in time.
04:58:21 Not necessarily for next week.
04:58:23 Do you have a deadline?
04:58:24 I think it would be cool if this could be a February thing.
04:58:31 We'd launch it in February.
04:58:33 Hmm.
04:58:34 We got new chapters of the thing and it's the first episode.
04:58:37 Probably.
04:58:38 Issue one of the perfect comic party.
04:58:42 I'm sure I could do something by February.
04:58:46 Alright.
04:58:47 Alright.
04:58:48 Sounds good.
04:58:49 Base.
04:58:50 Base.
04:58:52 Alright.
04:58:53 Let's end the episode here.
04:58:54 Right now.
04:58:55 Yeah.
04:58:56 Anna.
04:58:57 Anna.
04:58:58 Become a patron.
04:58:59 You'll be in a thank you page of that thing we just talked about.
04:59:02 Probably.
04:59:03 That's the end of the episode.
04:59:05 Yeah.
04:59:06 Goodbye.
04:59:07 That's the end of the episode.
04:59:08 Goodbye.
04:59:09 Send in speak type stuff.
04:59:10 Yeah.
04:59:11 Whatever.
04:59:12 Link in the description.
04:59:13 Whatever.
04:59:14 Bye.
04:59:15 Goodbye.
