00:01:38 I agree has a lifetime a lifetime more like
00:01:41 Nate says he's feeling fit and fine, and I gotta say that I feel nothing of the sort post rad con and that's what this
00:01:50 Podcast is all about fat fuckery
00:01:53 That's right
00:01:55 journey of being fat and not
00:01:58 It's I think just every aspect related to to fatness just
00:02:04 Odious forms. Yeah, of which none of us have because we all have I
00:02:10 Well, that's that's true
00:02:14 If we didn't have it before red con we do now that's that's for sure action giraffe was it worth it though?
00:02:19 I think it was
00:02:21 You know you can't get a giraffe job like that anywhere
00:02:25 It's all right
00:02:28 He kind of he coils his neck around your dick. Yes, that's how it is
00:02:33 So, let me give a little bit of backstory here like because right before rad con
00:02:39 We were all talking about like these sick diets. We were all gonna go on or we're on even
00:02:45 Jesse had just lost like 30 pounds or something through like just fasting for a month
00:02:51 Jesse's an insane person and can do these things. I don't know how Nate had just lost a bunch of way my broken
00:02:57 Brilliant, I'm down like 25 pounds for when I start so I'm looking good. I'm under 180 now
00:03:02 I had lost like a
00:03:04 Like 10 to 15 pounds before rad con Ben was talking about how he's bringing the squat rack down and me and him and DeVue
00:03:11 We're all gonna use the squat rack Ben. Why don't you tell us what happened with the squat rack?
00:03:15 Well, is that still a problem? Well, yeah, it is because okay
00:03:19 My squat rack at my last place
00:03:22 I had the squat rack, but we didn't have a place to put it because our landlord
00:03:26 Despite promising us the basement kept the basement locked and wouldn't let us in it
00:03:31 We were gonna set it up there. So when I finally moved down here to the fucking Casa de Conrad
00:03:37 I
00:03:38 Well, you know we we disassembled the squat rack put it in the car brought it to my parents house loaded up into the other car brought
00:03:45 It down here set it up realized I was missing a crucial part specifically the pegs on which the barbell rests
00:03:52 So yeah, so I called up my friend in my old place and was like hey are the are the parts lying around somewhere
00:03:58 And he was like yes, I will mail them to you. I was like, thank you friend
00:04:02 So like a week and a half later or like two weeks later
00:04:07 They arrive in the mail and it's the wrong part. I realized I was missing two parts two crucial parts
00:04:13 And he sent the other ones and I was like, oh are the other ones lying around and he was like, let me look
00:04:17 Oh, yep, here they are and so now and so now I'm waiting for those to arrive and once they they're
00:04:24 They'll be here soon
00:04:26 Okay, well, that's that that's great, but I just want to lift
00:04:29 I just want to fucking squat and deadlift and bench and be a strong boy
00:04:33 Understandable used to be however because I hate going to the gym
00:04:37 I fucking hate leaving the house to work out if I had the rack in the house
00:04:41 I would lift I would lift on the regular I have I have a I have a pull-up bar
00:04:47 You know like like in rad con house
00:04:49 There's a there's that pull-up bar in the kitchen, but I've got one that I'm looking at 24 hours a day
00:04:53 So all the time I just get up and bust out a bunch of pull-ups. Oh, yeah, like 30 now. I'm doing I'm killing
00:04:59 I'm a strong boy right now a lot of fucking pull-ups
00:05:03 My record is 50 my record is 50
00:05:07 I'm not that's that's legit that's legit when I was like 18 not not all at once right all at once all at once
00:05:20 We've got the we've got the one here I've been doing the same
00:05:22 I'm up to I'm up to guess guess how many I'm up to I'm gonna guess to 13 15
00:05:30 10
00:05:34 Human ability have been warped
00:05:38 Yeah, I'm up to five five five, okay
00:05:42 After like a week of doing pull-ups on the you know the biggest thing by far
00:05:47 Cuz yeah, the biggest thing is wait if you weigh little you can do like that's the most important thing even more than
00:05:53 Well, so so Radcon happened and I guess I
00:05:59 Decided everyone else I guess sort of got folded into my my my my big
00:06:05 Theatrics here that we just all completely let loose no one gave a fuck
00:06:10 Eating it all we ate out like 18 times we ate giant I hop and waffle house meals. We fucking we I
00:06:18 Personally, I drank probably two boxes of wine in the span of a week like you know, it was just non-stop debauchery
00:06:28 We were truly handboys that week I went there prepared for a week of decadence. That's what I
00:06:38 When I was there, I had no idea that that wasn't normal what you were doing
00:06:42 Well
00:06:43 It would be normal if it weren't for the fact that we were all on diets
00:06:47 Well, yeah, I went from I went from like before I got there like frying one chicken breast a day
00:06:53 To after getting there like going to Wawa and shoving ten donuts in my mouth
00:06:58 16 times a day. I was not planning to start a diet or a workout thing during Radcon
00:07:04 I went there with the full intention of you know, just you know indulging my all my vices and you know, you know
00:07:10 Just having fun just having fun with my hand boy. The problem is for Ben Radcon never ended and he's
00:07:23 Because at Radcon it was like yeah celebration. Let's you know, I'll get the soda with every meal
00:07:28 I even bought some sodas for the house for me to drink man. I was drinking alcohol every night, right?
00:07:34 So then Radcon's over and we're all like me and Ben and DeVoo are all like alright now
00:07:38 We're gonna start eating good again, and I'm immediately like I have withdrawals for everything
00:07:45 Yeah, I hadn't been smoking for like a month and a half
00:07:48 Ben comes around me and him start smoking together then somehow gets me up to like
00:07:53 Then somehow get like three or four a night Ben burns through like three packs in two weeks
00:07:58 And we're both fucking smoking up a storm. Don't tell them about my vices. I
00:08:04 I can't stop everything
00:08:06 I
00:08:07 Finally it took me like a couple weeks to like put the soda back away and be like, okay
00:08:11 No more soda again, and then I bought in a lot. I'm now smoking an electronic cigarette. So yes
00:08:18 Here's cancer. Good healthy excellent. I don't know if it cures cancer. That's that's what I hear
00:08:24 Maybe helps avoid it to some extent. Oh, yeah, where's my vape? Where's my oh, no, where's my vape? Oh, no
00:08:30 Crisis mode
00:08:39 You know what let's let's take this, you know, this is very this we're all just kind of talking about our own fitness right now
00:08:45 But let's take this a little bit more broad. Why do we all care so much?
00:08:50 What because it's the only thing that matters in life is being hashtag not fat I
00:08:57 I
00:08:58 Agree for me
00:08:59 It's not that the only thing that matters in life is having everyone know that you're well-laid
00:09:03 You're happy people have to know that your hashtag well-laid so that they'll know that your hashtag not fat if you
00:09:10 You have to get not fat to get well-laid so they know that you're not fat because just being not fat isn't enough to make them know
00:09:16 That you're not fat people are insane and they'll still think of you as fat like on the inside fat is like
00:09:23 Everyone is always looking down on you first for one reason or another and in my mind is just be that's their way of saying you're fat
00:09:29 So you have to get then and then you have to get all the girls and then you have to parade this this
00:09:35 Secession of sluts around these trophy girlfriends take them to all the parties and go look I do it with hot girls
00:09:41 Look, I'm not fat and they go well. He does have a girl around his arm. I guess he's finally truly
00:09:47 You know fat Jesse
00:09:49 I as the guy around here who's the most long-term committed to two fitness goals
00:09:54 For the longest stretch at least anyway
00:09:57 It is absolutely because I want people to see me and think this guy has his life together because I'm a deeply insecure person and
00:10:05 Only am happy when I'm feeling externally validated and I know it's because when you look fit people like you more
00:10:11 They'll assume that they are a better person and you're you know more likely to not even have girls
00:10:17 But you don't even get treated you don't even get treated like a human being unless you're a certain level of attractiveness
00:10:23 Yeah, let's be real. Yeah, you start with that with it. Well, I gotta say, you know, I'm I'm not that cons like for me personally
00:10:31 It's not like I need other people's validation
00:10:33 But when I see other people like Nate who are fit
00:10:38 I do think much more highly of them as a person just like automatically when I see fit people
00:10:44 I'm like, yeah, like anyone okay like not just any fit person though
00:10:49 Right if it's just like some bro, and he seems kind of douchey then I'm like, oh, whatever, you know
00:10:52 But if it's someone who's cool and they're fit. It's like a double whammy
00:10:58 Cool and fit let me have fucking everything. Let me tell you let me tell you about what a great person I am
00:11:04 See I have realized but by living, you know through my learned experience
00:11:09 See, I think I'm a pretty mediocre looking guy
00:11:13 Even when I was more fit like, you know, I still just I still just look like myself, right?
00:11:19 Like I mean people I think people work out with like they have these long-term goals
00:11:24 Like they want to look like I don't know they want to look like
00:11:27 Yeah, they want to look like Z's or they want to look like, you know, they want to be ripped or they want to be Brad Pitt
00:11:34 Some muscle guy or whatever, but like in reality the changes are subtle and
00:11:39 No, like almost no one ever fucking looks gets huge or looks like a fucking model or
00:11:45 No, no one ever it looks like their goals because there's things about your body that you can change and there's things about your body
00:11:52 That you can't like like your overall proportions are all gonna stay the same
00:11:55 You know like your height and like your shoulder to waist ratio and stuff
00:12:01 Depending where you start that can I mean if your hips shrink when you lose weight then you know a little bit
00:12:07 Anyway, I realized that you know like even even if I got even when I'm more muscular than I was now
00:12:13 I still like, you know, I still had kind of like a stocky build, you know, whatever and I'm just like, you know
00:12:19 being fit
00:12:21 doesn't matter and
00:12:23 Now I don't respect people for being fit. Well, I what this ties into my I mean, I mean I do
00:12:29 I mean, I think it's cool and all but like I used to I
00:12:33 Used to feel bad, right? Like watching say like like watching anime or something like the main character would be like pretty fit
00:12:39 Right, and I'd be like man, you know, I you know, I wish I looked like that or something like like I wish I was like
00:12:45 DBZ man DBZ inspired a generation including me to work now
00:12:48 But now I'm like, you know what looking like that is like half genetics and and it doesn't matter
00:12:54 And I no longer think that people are better for you just because they're worth it
00:12:59 I think I think they're worse if they're not. I don't think they're better if they are well
00:13:04 No, I do think they're better if they are I think I think what it is is like if there's a cool person
00:13:08 And he just happens to be fat you you don't hold it against them, but you like yeah
00:13:12 That's a shame. Oh, yeah, but if there's a bad person who's fat then they're way worse. Well, you know
00:13:16 I actually really like fat people who like own their fatness and throw it around those people are cool
00:13:22 You know, here's what it is. Here's what it is. If you if you like someone
00:13:27 Then yeah
00:13:29 That they're fat. It's true. It's totally true. It's really not a question about whether they're fat
00:13:35 All right, imagine this for a second. Do you like them? I don't know if I agree Ben
00:13:39 I don't think they'll like I know I think that people who like you like you less if you're fat
00:13:44 I genuinely don't know if you know if someone's cool then they're being fat is a part of their cool
00:13:50 I would say it's not that they don't it's not that they think less of you is this that they they feel like a
00:13:57 Separate sort of little disappointment in you that yeah, exactly like I have no chime in anyone
00:14:02 I know who like anyone who I know who is cool who is fat and I know that they like
00:14:08 Don't necessarily wish they were fat. Yeah, but that's it
00:14:11 That's but I feel like this constant Chloe like every time I look at them
00:14:15 I think God why won't you fucking not be fat anymore? Okay?
00:14:18 Here's what you people talked about like here's here's an example Drake and Josh right Josh peck started that show off chubby and adorable
00:14:25 Right and that's was part of his persona right is this chubby adorable guy by the time the show ended
00:14:31 He had somehow lost all his weight gotten tall gotten like really prettier than he was prettier than Drake at the end
00:14:37 Yeah, you know I'll drink at the end a hundred thousand dollars in debt
00:14:41 His whole persona just like didn't work out was fat Drake so
00:14:46 So so me and my brother
00:14:48 We go up we're watching that show back when we're kids loving that show and we watch that decline of his persona didn't work anymore
00:14:55 Well, it just so happened that my brother himself was a very chubby boy for like all his life until he was like 16
00:15:02 When the when the summer drought of 2012 came in and it was a hundred and five degrees every day
00:15:07 And he played tennis up against the side of a barn every day for hours and lost all of his weight
00:15:12 And one fell swoop and as he was doing it
00:15:15 I was like, you know like now that you're gonna lose your fat
00:15:19 You're not gonna be able to tell the same kind of jokes anymore
00:15:21 You're gonna be like Josh peck you need to adapt your style
00:15:25 All of his skits all of the like videos we did that were like little comedy things
00:15:29 He completely changed his persona to being like this like freaky weirdo guy and it totally works
00:15:35 So it's important whether or not you'll lose your charm if you get fit is just to be smart and adaptive and create a new
00:15:42 People are way terrible people are terrible at adapting to changes in their lives in general if they were better at that
00:15:48 I think that would help a lot with people like getting fit in the first place and then avoiding these like oh if I get fit like
00:15:53 Oh, I'm gonna have to change things about my life
00:15:54 You know just just be a new person just do things that you know lie to that
00:15:59 There's a great quote from from hot diggity demon Max Gilliardy where he said like you can't be funny if you're not funny looking
00:16:08 And after he said that like no after he said that
00:16:11 I looked at every single person I consider funny and I realized all of them were funny looking, you know
00:16:16 There's an episode point out looking in what way like Robin Williams doesn't look funny, but he still yeah
00:16:21 He does he looks incredibly funny because he looks like that guy looks like he will tell Jim an amazing joke
00:16:28 He just looks like a happy dude. I was gonna say Jim Carrey because Jim Carrey is spectacularly handsome
00:16:33 But that guy makes some pretty funny face. He's really funny. I don't
00:16:36 I'm funny looking as in like bad looking. I mean funny looking as in you look as though you can be funny
00:16:47 There's lots of people I look at and I go that person looks so fucking boring and unfunny and shitty
00:16:57 To do is not look funny, so that's true funny
00:17:01 He does not look weird as fuck
00:17:04 He's got like a weird bald head in spite of being like
00:17:10 He's he's a year older than me dude, I think he might be the most boring person I've ever looking
00:17:18 There is no scientific correlation between funny-lookingness
00:17:24 My confirmation bias
00:17:26 Clear
00:17:29 What's up, if you have like a like a
00:17:32 Like exaggerated features that you look kind of like a cartoon character or you can make funny expressions
00:17:37 Then it's easier to be like be visually funny
00:17:40 Anyone can make funny expressions anyone in the world can figure out that's not true look funny. It's not true
00:17:57 Is it if you have to accept this idea then you have to accept that you're funny-looking and you don't want to do that
00:18:04 Yeah, I know I'm funny-looking
00:18:06 What are you encouraging people to do when you say like you have to be funny-looking or you'll never be funny?
00:18:11 You're just living to figure out how to look funny the worst conversation
00:18:16 Let's get off of this. This is dumb. What are we talking about?
00:18:19 So I was thinking about why I would be drawn to like big muscly people
00:18:25 Because you're gay
00:18:28 Viewers at home spoiler. It's cuz he's gay. There's nothing more. There's nothing more beautiful than the male form. Okay, go on gay aside
00:18:36 You know I was thinking I think of myself as a pretty smart guy, right?
00:18:40 Like smarter than most people and so I think that like when other people are like there like what makes them impressive or whatever
00:18:48 Is that they're smart? I feel like yeah, but I'm smarter than that guy so that guy doesn't impress me
00:18:53 But then when someone's fit, it's like I'm not fit. So if someone's fitter than me
00:18:57 It's like I have some trust in them to be the muscle in the scenario
00:19:00 But there you go. There you go. You're coming from a place of ignorance
00:19:03 You're coming from a place of lack and it's making you and it's warping your perceptions if you had well you would if you had that
00:19:10 But okay, let's just how worthless it truly is well Ben
00:19:13 Let's say that we were out like let's say like at rad con like if we had been out for a drive
00:19:18 And my car had broken down in the middle of the highway and like who do you think I could most reliably expect to be able to
00:19:24 Push my car. I'm going with Nate and then probably Jesse next and not at all
00:19:31 Hippo can ride in the fucking trunk while we push the car
00:19:34 Like well like who would be physically capable of doing it. Yeah, that's what I'm saying like you have to innate like to me
00:19:42 There's some when I see someone who's physically fit and they're around it's like I I know I have someone
00:19:47 I can rely on when I need something physical to happen if I were to get if I hang out
00:19:53 My favorite thing about hanging out in like the city with some like my cousin boy. Who's this big motherfucker, right?
00:19:59 He's I mean he's fat, but he's also just big
00:20:08 If I'm hanging out with Boyd no one will ever fuck with me because if I was alone
00:20:13 I don't look imposing at all, but that dude looks scary. Who's gonna fuck with you anyway?
00:20:18 How often do you get into physical altercation?
00:20:31 Will you live in RoboCop world then when was the last time you lived the house leave the left yeah exactly
00:20:38 Okay, the point the point doesn't it doesn't really matter if these things happen or not what what really
00:20:44 What is at the heart of the whole thing is that we perceive these people to be more useful?
00:20:48 So we you know have a positive
00:20:50 You know because I know that I never get into physical altercation
00:20:54 Well, I have a constant paranoia that every single person in the world wants me dead and is going to kill me at some point
00:21:02 Yeah, but they're not gonna they're not gonna do it as a fair fight
00:21:08 Paranoia, but I'm smarter so I realized that I'm not gonna do it in a fair fight
00:21:12 Being fit has all kinds of real-world advantages and you never know when they're gonna be needed
00:21:17 And it's kind of a safety mechanism as well as like it helps your health
00:21:20 You know, there's a bunch of benefits to to be in fit. So it's a whole package. It's definitely positive basis
00:21:26 That's the thing with me. Is that like by not by not worrying about it. You mean?
00:21:30 No, I feel no by worrying about it
00:21:32 It just makes me feel more comfortable all the time sitting around like oh, hey
00:21:35 I did push-ups a few minutes ago. I'm okay with this feeling of just sitting or standing. It's a lot better
00:21:41 You know for me. I feel the rate what draws me to fitness is just how eat how like
00:21:47 I'm not all that tempted by like really delicious foods much more than I am just by like healthy food
00:21:53 like you know get some chicken and
00:21:55 Cook it with a tiny bit of butter and some water and some mushrooms and some cabbage and some
00:22:00 A spinach and then just eat that
00:22:03 I only like that taste slightly less than like a hamburger with like
00:22:07 Frot like like toasted buns and cream cheese and ketchup and a tomato
00:22:11 You know, but I feel a lot better after eating the other one. I feel like a lot of people
00:22:16 Can probably eat healthy and it's not even like wouldn't even be that hard if they just started because they're just not as tempted as other people may be
00:22:25 Yeah, I'm tempted by all food equally
00:22:29 Um, which is to say a lot
00:22:32 So you might as well eat healthy then you might as well, you know, yeah
00:22:35 I am by far most attracted to food prepared by professionals. That is the kind of food that I gravitate
00:22:40 Well, I know I never I never eat professionally like like a mcdonald's professional
00:22:46 Here's why I here's why I never eat out because one it's too expensive and two I resent paying
00:22:51 I resent paying food preparers for their labor. I don't think they deserve it
00:22:56 I don't think anyone deserves anything every time I every time I look at a menu the number one thing
00:23:00 I I think about is like can I what can I order that can justify?
00:23:04 Having someone else making it something I couldn't make myself, you know, but it's really almost nothing. You can't just make it home
00:23:11 I just I I emphatically disagree
00:23:13 There is nothing I've eaten at a restaurant that I could replicate with anywhere even 50 percent of
00:23:19 Oh, yeah in terms of the details, but you know what the main details are all that matters
00:23:24 I know but 100 percent of it. This this whole thing is very interesting to me
00:23:29 The uh, the the way you guys are talking about how food is important
00:23:31 But to me the perfect world is a world in which all the only food there is
00:23:37 Is that slop from the matrix that has all the nutrients you need basically soylent
00:23:41 All I want is that because then I don't have to even think about it. I can just work
00:23:44 I can do the things I need to do and I'll get a hundred percent of what I need supplements
00:23:48 Why don't you just become a supplement guy?
00:23:50 The only reason I don't is because I have to go out of my way to order it and currently soylent is not perfect
00:23:55 If we had the perfect thing that had everything I needed that would be that would be that I already do supplement
00:24:00 I have tons of whey protein like every day with shakes. I make delicious shakes, by the way, which are awesome
00:24:05 And they're super easy to make
00:24:07 But my dream is to not even have to spend any time on it
00:24:10 I would love to be a hamster with just like a spigot, you know with like a water bottle outside and just like put my
00:24:15 Mouth to it. I'm not all over my body. It's all I want. I do like food and making it
00:24:20 It's just I I like it, but I think of it as a human weakness that we crave it. I want it gone
00:24:24 I want to be a robot. I don't want to think about these things. I'm not really that extreme about it
00:24:28 Even if I had a robot body, I probably spend most of my time eating
00:24:32 Okay, well if I was a robot I could eat anything and just discharge it and it would matter
00:24:36 If I could have enough synthetic parts in my body that like that eating didn't make me fat
00:24:42 I would just never not be eating. That would be like my whole life. Sure. We all would but the machines we have
00:24:47 You know do get fat, you know, I'm referring to the human body. We get fat. We got all these issues. So
00:24:52 I've been considering being bulimic just just you know for the intellectual experience of like, okay, I'm growing up
00:24:58 Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about
00:25:01 Because then you can eat whatever you want. You can satisfy your cravings and then turn your teeth out of your face
00:25:05 Right, that that is one of the reasons that I haven't tried it yet
00:25:08 But maybe one I guess if you wear one of those mouth condoms, maybe
00:25:13 Well, it's just to go all the way down to your stomach. Yeah, I mean when you throw up. Yeah, okay
00:25:17 a mouth
00:25:19 Wait, I don't I don't
00:25:21 Oh my god
00:25:23 You get just gotta be like you just gotta be like fucking uh
00:25:27 Josuke and fucking wear a fucking rubber glove down your throat. Yeah
00:25:32 Catch whatever it is
00:25:34 Exactly
00:25:36 I'm gonna say be like Josuke and like punch through your stomach and just grab the food pull it out and then heal
00:25:41 In the most reasonable scene the most reasonable scene in the history of anime
00:25:47 When he fucking puts a rubber glove down his esophagus
00:25:50 Well, you know, whatever man to stand stands are well established to be crazy psychic things. They can do anything
00:25:55 So who cares
00:25:59 There's rules to these things the rules are they can do anything
00:26:05 I've personally never been fat
00:26:08 Just because of well
00:26:10 D
00:26:11 I'm saying I'm saying that I've never been fat. Nate has never been fat. That's true. The fattest I ever was
00:26:16 You know who else has never been fat hitler
00:26:19 Oh
00:26:21 No, he got fat. If you look at the later part of anything. I don't care about being thin
00:26:26 It's uh, uh, go on the point was that that's thin privilege talking
00:26:30 You can't see your own privilege
00:26:32 All right, forget it. No, no, please
00:26:35 Well, give I think I don't really know what my point is. It's just that I
00:26:39 Exercises has never been like a lose weight thing. The only reason I've been exercising recently
00:26:45 Is because I'm tired of having a bony butt and I want a nice butt that I can sit on that doesn't feel like shit
00:26:50 You gotta eat big you gotta eat big
00:26:52 You know, I was I was gonna say the hardest thing in my life so far was like when I was right now
00:26:57 I'm I'm losing weight
00:26:58 But when I was trying to gain, you know muscle for a long time. It was really hard
00:27:03 Uh, significantly harder than right now just restricting calories to eat more than I was comfortable eating
00:27:08 Per meal and just having to really calculate physically come do it. It's hard. It's really hard. Yeah, if you break it up over the day
00:27:14 It's easier. That was what killed victor when he was trying to do boxing was like rest. Oh, yeah
00:27:19 Like and rest and like yeah
00:27:21 I think a lot of people like anyone who doesn't know about like bulking doesn't realize like because uh, you know
00:27:27 My brother shade you guys all saw him. He's skinnier than all fuck, right?
00:27:31 Because he doesn't eat anything and like he's been for like months now
00:27:35 He's been working out like pretty regularly, but he hasn't really gained much because he just like
00:27:41 Even though he'll he'll move like you need to eat more and he'll be like I've been eating way more
00:27:44 I've been actually eating three meals a day and it's like
00:27:48 Yeah, you need to eat like 10 meals a day, buddy
00:27:51 He needs to get himself a calorie calculator and it's so just keep track of what you eat
00:27:55 And then you'll know like what you're doing now and then just add add some shit
00:27:59 You know, it's easy once you start thinking about the thing with calorie counting that I can't stand is that you have to
00:28:03 You have to expend calories thinking about it
00:28:07 It throws off the whole equation man. It's so much work try to think
00:28:13 I remember seeing a commercial advertising a cereal like
00:28:16 There's like all these cereals that say that they're really, you know
00:28:18 Have very few calories and then there was another cereal that came out saying it has even fewer calories
00:28:23 And the commercial is like a woman at a breakfast restaurant and she like looks at all the things and she has like a calorie scanner in her brain
00:28:29 Apparently non-diagetically. She looks at a donut 800 calories. She looks at like a waffle 400 calories
00:28:35 Then she looks at the competing brand. It's like 120 calories and she's like she's like i'll have that one
00:28:39 But then she looks at the other cereal 105 calories. She's like wait. No
00:28:43 I'll have that one and I watched that commercial when I was like a kid and and that was so retarded
00:28:49 I vowed to never calorie count because she looked like such an idiot doing it
00:28:57 I'm happy if no one else does it because I want everyone else to be a fat fuck because I'll only look better by comparison
00:29:02 It's great. Please continue. Please continue everyone my my fitness goals for here at fucking at digi house
00:29:09 Is I don't want to count my calories because I don't really feel like I need to lose much weight
00:29:14 but I do I do want to start like when I get that last part I want to start lifting because
00:29:19 I I like I haven't really gained or lost anyway
00:29:22 Uh, but I just want to get all right because even if you don't if you don't change what you eat at all, right?
00:29:28 Here's here's what's supposed to happen in theory if you don't change your dietary habits at all
00:29:32 But you start lifting then what starts to happen is your your you start you gain a little bit of muscle
00:29:38 Your metabolism goes up because your body has to burn more calories in order to maintain that muscle because muscle is more
00:29:44 Metabolically active than fat right um and then so just
00:29:49 If you start working out, you know, you will keep keep yourself at about the same weight
00:29:54 You won't gain or lose weight but more of your weight will be muscle and less will be unless will be right
00:29:59 Which is what I want to happen. So I don't I'm not that big about my diet
00:30:03 I just want to start lifting and fucking change my body composition because I'm because I'm a little bit
00:30:07 I guess I would say I'm a little on the skinny fat side right now
00:30:10 Which is a shame which is like the worst thing to be it is the worst it is the worst
00:30:13 But you so yeah be careful of that uh since are you following the teachings of ripeto mark ripeto because t-rex mode
00:30:20 Is always a danger when you're living the squat lifestyle doing that go mad gala milk a day
00:30:25 Yeah, I want to I want to be I don't want to be t-rex mode. I just I just want to be kind of the squat rack can be used for benching
00:30:32 Too it's got a I know I use mine for benching too. Yeah. Yeah, um
00:30:36 I want to bench all the time because I've always had my bench has always been my my worst lift
00:30:43 It's fuck lifting
00:30:45 Lifting is great. No it is not great shut up
00:30:49 You shut up. It feels good. We need it. We need it. There needs to be some discussion
00:30:54 The world needs to come together. We need to come together as a society and talk about how fucking boring
00:30:59 Lifting is it is boring. That's true miserable. Okay
00:31:03 Jeff everyone goes. Oh, you know, uh, yeah working out is hard
00:31:07 But you just gotta push through it and then you can do it. No, it's not hard. It's fucking boring
00:31:14 I
00:31:18 Why don't I just fucking kill myself
00:31:20 Well, I have to take out of my day to go lift is always the reason that I end up missing it, you know
00:31:26 Okay, here's here's here's all right. Yes, it is kind of boring
00:31:29 But I mean most people that exercise don't lift they do cardio and cardio is 10,000 times more boring than lifting
00:31:37 It's also more effective for overall health. They say cardio is a lot easier
00:31:42 It's a lot less boring because you're doing the same you can go on autopilot by just running on a treadmill
00:31:47 That's why it's fucking boring, dude. When you're lifting when you're lifting when you're lifting you have like a little micro goal
00:31:54 No, when you're lifting it's like it's like standing at a conveyor belt and the conveyor belt is your body
00:31:58 And you're just like Lucy shoving those chocolates into your mouth the same fucking repetition over and over lift it up and put it down
00:32:04 Lift it up put it down
00:32:07 No, you have to like concentrate on what you're doing when you're lifting so it's less boring
00:32:14 There's actually like a risk. All right. Hang on. Good. Good. What's up?
00:32:18 The thing was like when I'm like running or cycling on a thing
00:32:22 Like it's a it's a repetitive thing you you can turn your brain off
00:32:25 But you can listen to music and that makes it not boring when you're lifting
00:32:29 You have to you have to concentrate on it and you can't
00:32:31 That's exactly why it's not boring
00:32:35 Okay, if you have to concentrate on lifting
00:32:38 Lifting which is boring then that is twice as boring like going out for a run at least you can think about anything else
00:32:46 That's boring fucking plot out your novel like I mean to me like going for a long walk
00:32:52 I don't even feel like it's like cutting out of my day in any way because i'm thinking about the same shit
00:32:57 I'd be thinking about at home. So it's like I'm just doing what I would be doing except
00:33:02 I'm also walking or else like something that you can something that you can zone out of and think about something else
00:33:07 That's the definition of boring. That's all I'm saying. Yeah, but there's nothing. I find more boring
00:33:13 It's always boring. It's just that when you can zone out you can do something else, which is you know, it's entertaining
00:33:18 That's that's literally the definition of layering or you see that's what being boring means
00:33:22 Everything I've been doing has been all focused on making any sort of routine or habit that that is
00:33:30 Is structured around the lifestyle and daily flow. I already have you know and what I've been doing a lot
00:33:36 Every almost every day is just watching tons of anime
00:33:39 And so I like to do things that make that flow in with that really easily like getting a dumbbell and doing curls
00:33:46 Because you can watch stuff while doing curls. So I just like to do that, you know sometimes
00:33:51 Yeah, but then you're just curling. Yeah, but you know you can do more like one thing
00:33:55 I usually will do is that I will do like push-ups and sit-ups during the opening and ending themes
00:34:01 And that has made me able to do way more push-ups than I could before I'm sure at the beginning at the start of the year
00:34:07 I probably couldn't do like five
00:34:09 Because I hadn't been doing anything and now I can do like 30. I just busted out 30 pull-ups by the way. No big deal
00:34:16 I said push-ups day niggers from outer space. Uh, everyone worship me. I'm the greatest man in the world
00:34:22 Now you're going to sound all fucking winded through the whole podcast
00:34:29 Because I do cardio I recover quickly. All right, here's the thing
00:34:33 Here's a big part of why I have such a trouble working out
00:34:36 It's kind of tied to what devu was saying that like, you know, it's good to find stuff that flows into your day
00:34:41 I don't feel like anything flows into my day because for me
00:34:44 That's why I want to have the rack in the house so that I can just take like a little half an hour break
00:34:49 Head over there do like a couple squats and I mean just get right back to it even then like even just doing normal like
00:34:54 You know calisthenics stuff like when I feel
00:34:58 Sweaty and winded it makes me not want to do my job
00:35:01 You know like the job of sitting at a computer and typing which is entirely your arms sitting up
00:35:07 You know like as you type shit and it's like if your arms are sore because you just did 50 push-ups
00:35:12 Then that suddenly is miserable. You know, well did you all right? Let me tell you that's why I really love gross or something
00:35:17 That's why what I I have a ritual that I love doing of exercising
00:35:20 Immediately showering and then for the rest of the day, I feel like a golden god because I did my shit
00:35:26 Then I can just do my work
00:35:27 That's part of why I want to get back into an exercise routine because it was great because it'll make me shower more
00:35:34 Oh god, because I really should and let me tell you Ben needs that Ben could use that
00:35:39 Fuck off. I I admit. I'm look
00:35:42 I fucking I fucking live at my fucking house and I don't I work at home
00:35:47 Mostly, you know, I sit in my room and I draw all the time. I don't worry about going out very much
00:35:52 So yes, sometimes I go a few days without a shower because I don't think anyone's gonna see me
00:35:57 And but you know what? I feel terrible about it and I hate myself and I want to change
00:36:01 As long as you do that, okay
00:36:04 As long as they're shame
00:36:05 I'm satisfied so anyone listen. Oh, they're shame
00:36:08 You don't necessarily be discouraged by what did you said about not wanting to do computer stuff
00:36:13 After you've done a little bit of like working out because like I'm totally I don't I don't feel the same way at all
00:36:20 Usually when I've been sitting around too long
00:36:22 I start to feel like death is approaching
00:36:25 I know that feeling and I got rid of that feeling when I bought a $500 computer chair
00:36:29 That's how I got rid of that feeling
00:36:32 Well, don't so guys whatever you do don't buy a $500 computer chair. What's what's so special about this chair
00:36:39 You can sit in it for eight hours before it starts to really make you feel like yeah
00:36:43 Does it have a butt dildo? Is that what it is?
00:36:46 You've you've seen my chair, right? Yeah, but I didn't sit. I didn't experience it. I didn't experience
00:36:50 Well, it's the thing is it's not like it's not comfortable in a traditional sense. It's just
00:36:56 You can sit in it. Sounds like $500 well spent
00:36:59 Well, no like okay when you sit in like a comfortable chair
00:37:03 You're like, wow, this is real comfy and then like an hour later. You're like, oh my god my back
00:37:08 I'm gonna die in this chair. You sit in it and you're like
00:37:11 Oh, this is this this doesn't feel like anything but then suddenly like eight hours have passed and you're like
00:37:17 Now my back's starting to feel funny. Oh, right. I've been sitting in this chair for eight fucking hours
00:37:22 Let me bring up a fitness related pet peeve of mine and Nate. I'm sure I'm sure you're gonna agree the rest of you
00:37:29 I'm not sure. We'll see. We'll we'll see how stupid you are. I'm interested
00:37:33 um
00:37:35 When when girls say I don't want to lift because I don't want to get all ripped and muscled
00:37:41 Ah
00:37:43 No, no one please
00:37:46 Let me just I hear this all the fucking time. It drives me insane
00:37:50 Yeah, girls are well, well, you know what I was about to say girls are stupid
00:37:54 But actually everyone's stupid everyone's stupid on this point. Nobody doesn't people when you work out when you lift to gain weight
00:38:00 First of all, no girls think okay
00:38:02 Well, I just what I just said about you know how if you don't change your diet
00:38:06 But if you start lifting all that happens is you lose fat and gain muscle
00:38:09 You used to keep the same weight you keep about the same proportions or you keep about the same weight
00:38:13 You lose fat and you gain muscle you get you know quote unquote toned you get more toned is what is what happens
00:38:20 um
00:38:21 I don't want to get ripped. I do want to get toned. That's what I don't want to get
00:38:25 I don't want to keep muscle mass. That's gross girls think that if they gain any muscle
00:38:29 They will look like a bodybuilder
00:38:30 They will they think that if they fucking touch a weight if they pick up a single dumbbell that they will
00:38:35 Ew they'll get like some weird bulgy bicep that they'll get like veins in their arms
00:38:39 People are so fucking you know, you know, even guys think this too even guys. Can you imagine a male being stupid? It's true viewers
00:38:49 Even are you fucking SJW piece of shit? I
00:38:52 Yeah, guys think gut people think that if they fucking touch a weight like oh
00:38:57 I only want to do cardio because I only want to get toned people work for fucking years
00:39:01 They put in years of hard work and dedicated effort to fucking get ripped and people think that they'll do it by accident
00:39:07 Like it'll happen overnight without them noticing and then they'll be oh, no
00:39:11 Oh, no, I'm so muscular all of a sudden. Whoops. What a shame that I fucking lifted it all
00:39:17 Guys just to put a some numbers to put some numbers to this. That's not necessarily stupid. It's also
00:39:32 All right go all right you're first
00:39:35 I hate them
00:39:37 All right. Well, anyway, it's stupid. I was just gonna say to put it I was gonna say it's not necessarily stupid
00:39:43 It's dishonest and lazy. They know they're not gonna accidentally become ripped. They're just making excuses for themselves
00:39:50 Fucking idiot faggots
00:39:53 All right, I know people all right that is part of it that is sure some people I'm sure fall under that
00:39:58 But it's a lie that they've convinced themselves of
00:40:01 I agree and by the way, if you gain 10 pounds, so like less than one pound a month of intense lifting
00:40:07 That is like miraculous. That is great viewer. If you're sitting at home if you're sitting at home and you don't exercise
00:40:14 Um
00:40:15 100 percent of you would look way better
00:40:18 If you gain 10 pounds of muscle 100 percent you might think that that would look bad
00:40:23 You might think that being muscular is not an attractive look. You are wrong. You are wrong and ladies out there
00:40:29 I love muscular girls get ripped get ripped. I'll fuck you. I'll fuck the shit out of you. I love
00:40:35 I don't I don't really like I don't really like I don't really like the muscular look on a girl
00:40:39 But I do ladies at home
00:40:41 If you gain 10 pounds of muscle, you won't look like a fucking ripped weirdo. You won't get that look
00:40:46 You're just gonna look female bodybuilders female power lifters. Watch the watch. Look how cute they are. They're perfect
00:40:51 They're perfect women. I want us
00:40:53 I I used to I mean when I was in like college, you know, I read up
00:40:57 I read shit tons of literature on like the science of weightlifting and the science of you know
00:41:01 gaining muscle and stuff and so I like I haven't put it into practice in a while
00:41:05 But back in the day I did I was lifting like not I wasn't lifted
00:41:09 I wasn't breaking any records or anything
00:41:10 But I was lifting respectable amounts and I want to get back there and but yeah during that time
00:41:15 I would talk about fitness with people and nobody had any fucking clue
00:41:19 Nobody reads the goddamn sticky
00:41:21 I I don't want I don't want I only do cardio. I don't want to lift at all
00:41:24 I don't want to look like a bodybuilder. Ew idiots if they knew what bodybuilders eat
00:41:29 They would not have that concern. It's just such really should not such ignorant
00:41:34 That's what kills me. There's so much ignorance on such a vital
00:41:38 Area of being a fucking human being with a body. No, no
00:41:41 Ignorance and as Jesse said dishonesty and laziness. Yeah, right. I want to ask a question about about uh about uh
00:41:49 Lifting and stuff. Sure. I'm a kind of a new but at exercise and stuff. So I you probably know what to do. Um
00:41:56 If I want to bulk up
00:41:58 And I do the the right exercises for that. Am I supposed to do
00:42:01 A bunch of reps or like hold the reps for a really long time
00:42:05 What you want to do there's a there's a sweet spot that has been researched
00:42:09 Uh, and I think in like the 80s
00:42:11 They did some studies or this and they found out that like if you if you shoot for first of all you always want to go
00:42:16 To exhaustion. So just do reps until you can't do anymore
00:42:20 But you want to shoot for about 12 to 15 reps is the optimal sweet spot
00:42:24 So if you can do 15 and you fail, that's great
00:42:27 Do you mean 15 reps in one set or do you mean like three sets of five?
00:42:31 I mean, I mean 15 in one go
00:42:33 I mean, there's distinctions between um, if you do if you do it for 15 reps per set and do three sets
00:42:39 Like doing 15 is more for uh strength and then doing five heavier
00:42:45 You know doing five reps with heavier weight that more builds muscle or builds like size
00:42:50 All right, I'm just saying that this is this is what I've been hurt
00:42:53 And it's all of all of the strength building routines that I know of recommend sets of five
00:42:58 When I think it's you just want to do it you want to do it with enough weight
00:43:02 That that three sets of five exhausts you when me and victor were going to the gym together
00:43:07 We would start with like like weights that we could like whatever weight I could comfortably
00:43:13 Do 15 reps with and then from there
00:43:16 I would go up to each different one and see how far I could get until I got to a weight. I couldn't lift
00:43:21 Yeah, yeah, that's what you're supposed to do. And then I mean you keep the same number of reps, but you increase the weight
00:43:26 Yeah, and that basically every time you do that exercise. Yeah, you increase the weight try to do it
00:43:31 And like whatever your number is that you are able to do until your failure
00:43:34 That's fine. But just do it again next time until you can do like 12 or 15 then up it and so on
00:43:39 Okay, what I've been doing at the moment because I think I misheard you at one point earlier
00:43:44 Not none this podcast, but like I told me to hold it for a really long time
00:43:48 So I've just been doing like two or three
00:43:50 for like holding it until
00:43:53 That is that's that's really funny. Uh, yeah, no, no, that's not the no, you don't know hold
00:43:58 Holding a rep is not is not a thing
00:44:00 But I mean some people do it, but it's dumb doing them slowly is a good idea like doing it take like one one thousand two
00:44:06 and thousand up one
00:44:08 Maybe if you're doing a curl or some other gay lift well
00:44:11 If you're doing like a good lift like a squat or a bench press, you don't want to hold it
00:44:15 You want to you want to just you want to do it like explosively and just like power through them
00:44:20 Yes, that's true
00:44:21 And if you got any other questions give ask me anytime because I would love to be of use in this area
00:44:27 How do I muscle my dick?
00:44:29 You kegels dog kegels, you know, you got to do dick push-ups
00:44:33 Those two
00:44:36 Power or size man. Are you looking for power or size? You gotta all about the size
00:44:41 I only I only do cock push-ups for aesthetics
00:44:46 Hey, Jesse, we can see you're playing Tomb Raider
00:44:49 What discord discord is is what it's betrayed. Oh, yeah
00:44:53 Quit playing Tomb Raider anniversary
00:44:56 traitor
00:44:58 I hate
00:45:01 I bet the best program
00:45:04 Sulking and I'm playing Tomb Raider. No one can stop me
00:45:08 Laura Croft lifts for share and she looks good as fuck. So ladies be like her
00:45:12 Hey guys now, let's talk about another issue relevant to this which is being held back by the people around you
00:45:19 Oh, that's a big one dude. That's a big one. It is pretty big. You gotta be in a really depressing topic
00:45:24 Well, okay, here's it. Here's an example from my personal life, you know, because like
00:45:29 My family has
00:45:32 Up until we all got old enough to start affording our own groceries and shit, you know
00:45:36 Like my family has a problem where everyone has different taste and food and different needs and wants from the grocery store
00:45:43 You know, and it's like at dinner time. We make dinner for five
00:45:47 So it's gonna be whatever all five people can eat and if you're trying to do like a hardcore lifting regimen
00:45:53 Then you're gonna be stuck eating some fucking dumb bullshit that has nothing to do with your diet and plan
00:45:59 You know, it's like you kind of have to be self-sufficient about your food or at least like, you know
00:46:04 If you're if you're not old enough or you don't have enough money to be self-sufficient about your weightlifting then convince your parents like
00:46:11 Let me buy 10 cans of chicken, please, you know, like
00:46:15 Cans of chicken. Well, you know, I I think I really think that wait, mate
00:46:19 You don't do cans of chicken for uh, I buy I buy breasts dude. I buy fresh fresh chicken in a can fry them up
00:46:25 That's a common thing chicken in my my my friends when my friends were talking what they would do is buy like
00:46:31 Five like each each day they'd come home from the gym
00:46:35 And my friend brando would take like five huge cans of chicken and five huge cans of tuna
00:46:39 Mix them all into a bowl with like like an egg and like a bunch of other shit
00:46:43 And then just have this gigantic bowl of chicken and tuna and then just eat all of it and that was how they bolt
00:46:49 So this is this is like that's pretty good. Okay, you know, wait, wait, wait
00:46:53 Do you not know canned chicken? Is this weird like yeah, this is weird
00:46:58 I've never known anyone who does is it like can chicken with
00:47:02 Grady that you would get from a pie. Is that so no, it's just chicken breast in a can
00:47:06 It's like the way you get tuna in a can same thing. Yeah, it's the same
00:47:10 I don't know that I have no idea what that is. I've never seen this actually sounds pretty good. That's great. That sounds really
00:47:17 It's extremely great and extremely convenient. It's the best canned chicken
00:47:20 It's by far the best like because the reason they all ate that is because it's the best protein for your dollar that you could get
00:47:26 Like you can get eggs
00:47:28 Eggs are number one in my book. Like you can't eat 20 eggs at once or you're gonna get sick
00:47:32 So, you know, you can eat 20 cans of chicken that are like Gaston ate two dozen eggs every breakfast and three dozen every evening
00:47:39 So don't tell me what you can't do with eggs. Gaston's a fucking car too. Gaston is just fucked though, bro
00:47:43 Three dozen eggs, but now that he's grown, he eats four. Oh my mistake. I undersold it. No, it wasn't four and now it's five
00:47:50 It keeps going up. I don't know when he's I don't remember the Gaston diet
00:47:54 You know, you know why the beast was able to beat him because he eats six dozen eggs. That's why that's why I should
00:47:59 It's a lot of eggs
00:48:01 It's a considerable amount
00:48:02 But no to get to DeVue's point
00:48:04 It's entirely true that especially if you're a kid if you live it's it's because we live in these little pack units
00:48:10 Where if you're a kid you're entirely dependent on whatever your parents buy you have to eat it. You can't even argue
00:48:15 I think people I think that generally like the the cleanliness of one's diet is overvalued
00:48:21 I think people should worry more about the lifting
00:48:25 Unless they're like unless they're like an experienced lifter and they're really trying to do like a dedicated bulk or something
00:48:30 Well, that's the thing dude
00:48:31 If you just I think lifting's more important and that should be the focus
00:48:34 But oh if your parents buy you shitty food and you eat it for dinner
00:48:37 Well, yeah, it's not great, but you know what there are worse
00:48:40 Well, I'm not even really concerned about the quality of the food so much as the volume
00:48:43 Because when you're trying to bulk you need a lot of fucking food and you need to eat the right
00:48:48 You can't have fucking pies all the time and expect to gain
00:48:51 You know the kind of muscle you're looking for you you need, you know protein
00:48:54 You need that shit in your diet and even for me
00:48:56 I eat a ton of protein supplement with my food
00:48:58 Even then it's still hard to get like there's a there's a rule of thumb that if you're trying to bulk
00:49:02 You should go for like a one gram of protein per pound of body weight you have per day
00:49:07 So that's for me. That's like 180 grams
00:49:09 Oh my god, you really have to eat jeep. That's a lot
00:49:12 That's a lot of grams, right?
00:49:14 Well, your average person does not eat that much
00:49:16 Families like families and stuff is I think that a pretty sizable percentage of parents want their kids to be fat
00:49:23 Because or rather they don't feel better about themselves like they don't like I feel like a lot of
00:49:28 I was being hyperbolic. I feel like parents, especially moms usually put way more emphasis on
00:49:34 Having their kids be fed than having their kids be fit because of their, you know
00:49:39 A genetic desire to feed their children once again really hard for them to care about fears about their past like my dad
00:49:46 My dad grew up when he was in high school. His family had no food
00:49:50 So he was like super deathly skinny and like he was a super sporty guy
00:49:53 But he couldn't play on any teams because he was too fucking skinny
00:49:56 And so like he saw it. He's always seen it. It's like, you know
00:50:00 Everyone should like, you know, if you live in if you're in my house and you're hungry
00:50:04 You can eat you can eat whatever it is
00:50:06 It must be like he's always wants there to be food for people to eat and for you to eat whatever you want, you know
00:50:12 and I mean
00:50:13 Thankfully
00:50:14 Me victor and shea to all have pretty small appetite. So none of us have ever become super fat
00:50:19 But we easily could have you know, it's like overcompensating for my dad having been, you know, right?
00:50:25 So once again, this meme of uh caring about your kid's happiness strikes. Who gives a shit how happy your kids are
00:50:32 Our children need to be swole earth. They need to be more muscly. They need to be bigger
00:50:36 I don't care about my kids being happy. They should be as unhappy as possible
00:50:40 Uh to make them productive members of society. They're happy to see if they can figure that out someday later. Great
00:50:45 I don't care
00:50:45 incidentally, uh since I brought up my dad one of the one of the
00:50:50 biggest reasons that I feel the need to work out and get swole is because my dad is really healthy and really fit
00:50:57 And like it there's there's definitely for me a deep sense of embarrassment that I am half my dad's age
00:51:04 And he could easily beat me in a fight easily outrun me any I mean
00:51:08 He runs fucking like 10 kilometers in a in a morning just because he feels like it, you know
00:51:14 He'll bike across the whole fucking city and I can like run across my lawn and I'm winded, you know
00:51:19 So like just knowing that I am this able-bodied, you know
00:51:25 20 25 year old guy like I should be able to do all these great things, you know
00:51:30 But no my dad if he wanted to could lay me out in a heartbeat, you know, and like that's upsetting to me
00:51:36 I mean he doesn't upset me as much that victor is so fit because victor's also like
00:51:42 I mean victor's like broad-shouldered and like
00:51:44 Like he has he has the kind of physique that he would be able to beat me up even if I was muscular, you know, but uh
00:51:51 Millennials are ruining the movie industry and everything else says able-bodied man
00:51:59 That's a headline. Yeah
00:52:03 You said you said able-bodied. Yeah, I know why it happened
00:52:09 Um
00:52:10 Oh god, you completely threw me off. I have a problem eating a lot of stuff specifically like when
00:52:17 I have the opposite problem
00:52:18 It's the middle of the day and it's lunch lunchtime and I'm supposed to go and make something because no one's around
00:52:25 And I just like I'm too lazy to just get anything. I mean just don't eat anything
00:52:29 Hippo, I advise getting into protein powder because I mean you don't have to eat it
00:52:33 You just consume a bunch of powder and like a drink and it's done and that'll give you all that protein you need to build with
00:52:40 Some of them are even good. Yeah, it's not bad. Yeah
00:52:42 The protein powder I used to make my shapes is it make me shakes is absolutely delicious. I love it. It's the best
00:52:48 I eat shapes. I eat shapes. Yeah. All right. Let's talk about something more interesting. Um, such as
00:52:55 Fat women we hate them. Yeah. All right guys. Are you ready for a mind blow? Okay, but way long ago
00:53:01 We were talking about how if you like someone then like their fatness, you know, you'll like excuse it for them or whatever
00:53:06 It's picture this picture me seeing a fat woman
00:53:10 Liking her and not wanting her to die. It's happened. I'm just saying it's happened in my life. Can you believe that?
00:53:15 It's hard for me. I knew it. I'm a traitor. I'm a traitor. It's true
00:53:20 I've even been attracted to some imagine that if you like someone
00:53:24 Then it doesn't matter if they're fat. You'll excuse their fatness. It's true
00:53:27 It's not really the most important thing. I can't see myself talking to a fat person. Honestly, you know
00:53:33 Look at you fat person. You talk to cider. Well, not fat. And yeah, you think that
00:53:39 You were friends with fat people before by the time I became friends with cider. He was already hashtag not fat
00:53:46 I mean, he's fluctuated here and there but uh, you know, I mean when he when he was a kid
00:53:51 He was like 300 pounds and now he's like my weight. So
00:53:55 I don't consider myself fat. Well, you know, I mean, I definitely stupid
00:53:59 I used to consider myself to an adherent of the peter griffin rule of
00:54:03 Men can't be fat only women are fat, but I found myself excusing even them
00:54:08 When I when they're just when they're cool people, you know, it's just if I just don't like fatness
00:54:13 I think it's a bad thing to do for the most part unless you're hilarious. Um
00:54:18 Yeah, well, that there's a threshold where it becomes a bit
00:54:21 Much where like they're whiter than they are
00:54:24 Our healthcare at some point I have to pay for people who are less healthy and being fat makes you more risk
00:54:31 Uh a verse, you know, and that's just a bad I just just don't do it like I have to pay for that
00:54:35 Wait, that makes you risk a verse. Well, I don't think he meant a verse. You know what I mean
00:54:40 I think it means prone prone. That's that's what I meant. Oh, yeah. Yeah
00:54:45 So on that basis, I think I have a reasonable claim to ask people politely to uh, be consider the rest of our tax dollars
00:54:52 Thanks, obama
00:54:53 Yeah, um, I I okay. I'll talk about now. Um the problem I'm
00:54:59 I I encountered
00:55:01 Today yesterday
00:55:04 Uh the the past month so rad con happened all my vices came back and I've been struggling to get rid of them
00:55:10 but like
00:55:11 uh, the problem I'm having right now is
00:55:14 That there's a lot of shit going on in my life at the moment, you know
00:55:17 I got two new people living in my house. My parents are gone
00:55:21 You know, the house was a huge fucking mess after rad con and we only just cleaned it. Um
00:55:27 Like and I'm trying to get like all these projects off the ground me and devour working together
00:55:31 We're watching all this fucking anime trying to make these projects and stuff and at the same time trying to like
00:55:37 Work out and or diet and and stop smoking and all of that at once is just too much
00:55:44 And at some point I thought okay, I can't do all these things at the same time
00:55:48 But I need to get the work stuff done first
00:55:52 So I kind of went like fuck it, man. Fuck the diet. Fuck quitting smoking. I'll buy an e-cigarette
00:55:58 And uh, that's where I am right now. So I mean I'm in the danger zone if you will
00:56:03 What what advice do you have about this, Nate?
00:56:07 Well, that's that's was my that was my plan too. That's why I wasn't worried about anything else
00:56:11 The only thing I really wanted was to get the squat rack set up and start lifting and you know, fuck the diet
00:56:16 And if I get that settled then I'll be good
00:56:19 I think that what's what the best thing to do in a situation like you like you can't make a
00:56:23 No one in the world can just do a lateral shift to like a whole new lifestyle all at once. So like
00:56:29 It's small changes. I guess I would definitely make a plan of everything you want to change
00:56:34 For these things they're concerned like just get them all in a row and then just like do one like the easiest one preferably
00:56:40 Yeah, whatever it is. Just like do that the biggest problem for me is like, yeah, okay
00:56:44 Eating out makes me happy and working out does not make me happy and that's the hardest part is like
00:56:51 You know what?
00:56:51 It's you know deciding because I'll be midway through the day and I'll be like man
00:56:56 I could really use a sub sandwich right now or I could really use a cigarette at no point in any day in my life
00:57:03 If I ever gone man, I could really use 10 push-ups right now. That would make me feel swell, you know
00:57:08 No, but when I when I was when I was actually work
00:57:12 When I I didn't I didn't I never got the thing about feeling good after working out
00:57:16 But I did when I was so good afterwards when I was into a lifting routine
00:57:20 I did just kind of always passively feel a little better like yeah
00:57:24 It feels good to finish
00:57:26 Hey, you know what I mean?
00:57:29 Yeah, it does do because all the time I could just think I don't know
00:57:33 I just just felt more energetic and I could always think like yeah, I'm fit. I lift a bunch, you know
00:57:37 I it just passively felt a little better all the time
00:57:40 Do you really not feel Ben after like specifically after I work out and then if I shower right then and then I step out of the shower
00:57:46 I feel like a god. I feel like I'm glowing. I feel so great
00:57:50 I mean like I feel like Dennis Reynolds like I am the king of the entire fucking world
00:57:54 And everyone is below me and with to do with what I will like two years ago
00:57:58 Was the period when I was most regularly working out it was and me and victor were actually going to the gym
00:58:03 And uh, and I I got down to like 155 pounds
00:58:06 which is the lightest I've been in my adult life and uh, and you know
00:58:11 I I felt
00:58:12 Like measurably stronger and I really liked that aspect of it
00:58:16 I liked the idea that like I can I felt like I you know
00:58:19 The idea of like getting up to go do something was so much less tiresome
00:58:24 Like if I if I was thinking uh, let's say my dad calls me up is like hey, uh, go buy this thing from the store
00:58:30 And I'm like, yeah, I want to move. You know like that part was cool
00:58:33 but
00:58:34 Every single time I worked out I felt like shit for the rest of the day and usually the next day as well
00:58:40 And I really like
00:58:45 The last few times I worked out I felt like shit for
00:58:49 For a while, but it's just because I wasn't into the routine anymore. I wasn't accustomed to that level of activity
00:58:54 Is it because the doms? Is it the doms you're getting?
00:58:56 Not the doms just like fatigue
00:58:58 Every single time I did it
00:59:00 I was thinking like when am I gonna reach the point that I am that I am capable
00:59:05 Like when is this gonna get to the point where I've done it enough and now I feel good about it
00:59:10 But the thing is if you want to make progress you have to constantly you have to always push yourself to the limit
00:59:15 You know like your your muscles won't grow unless you rip your muscles
00:59:18 And if you rip your muscles then the next day your muscles are gonna feel like shit and so like
00:59:24 No, that goes away. You eventually get accustomed to that level of exertion. Let me just tell you I my friend Femian college
00:59:30 Uh, absolute legend of a man like he once he once thought that he checkmated me so expertly
00:59:36 This is after I like first started working out. He's like Nate. How? Okay, so when you work out
00:59:40 You rip your muscles then your muscles are torn the next day you work out again after your muscles have healed
00:59:46 They're torn again, but you're tired from that previous workout at what point will you ever get stronger than when you started?
00:59:51 It's never gonna happen. They checkmate working out as a waste of time
00:59:55 Get it out. You've got it out like understand that like how I mean how would anybody get strong if that
01:00:02 true
01:00:04 It's like zeno's fucking period
01:00:07 It's impossible to get stronger because you're always getting tired from working out like
01:00:13 To give Femi credit. He might have just been dunking on me and I just I mean
01:00:17 Did you at some point ask him like explain strong people then?
01:00:21 Well, yeah, and he also started working out recently
01:00:25 So I think he got over it if he ever really wasn't just fucking with me
01:00:29 But yeah, like you are going to feel uncomfortable. Okay, but the whole thing about dom's
01:00:34 Just as okay dom's goes away after you've worked out for a while
01:00:38 You stop getting the pains in your muscles for me
01:00:40 It takes maybe like two to three weeks of like lifting maybe every other day
01:00:44 And I just don't get it anymore after I've taken a break for a while and as for the fatigue
01:00:48 I mean I've been doing a hardcore running program running every other day for the last
01:00:53 Three months or so now and I just I just feel great all the time
01:00:57 I can't wait to run when I do I feel good when I'm running at the end
01:01:01 I feel like shit and I want to be dead and I hate everything about my life
01:01:04 But right afterward after I've showered and feel like a god again
01:01:07 Uh, I just I just don't feel tired and I can sleep easier
01:01:10 It's easier for me to go to bed at the right time and my whole life just feels bad
01:01:13 I'd love to be at that point, but like you know those months are hard those starting months are tough
01:01:18 Yeah, like well because you know me we've all been doing these pull-ups on the pull-up bar
01:01:22 And like there was a day where I got up to four pull-ups is the the best I'd done yet
01:01:27 And then this was like two weeks ago
01:01:29 I went into the to the garage where ben's got the squat racks set up
01:01:33 But you know obviously doesn't work and I just grabbed each of you soon
01:01:36 I just started taking the weights off the rack and just like doing a bunch of uh
01:01:40 Arm workouts with them, you know, I did a bunch of curls a bunch of like
01:01:43 Shoulder things over the head stuff like all all that good us as shit that you could do with big fucking round circular weights, right?
01:01:49 and I
01:01:51 Have not yet been able to do like more like I like every time I go to do four pull-ups again
01:01:59 I'm still sore and it has not stopped for two weeks
01:02:02 I have not had a single time where I could get up and go to do pull-ups and I felt like oh now
01:02:06 I'm finally ready again. Like it's just you know
01:02:11 I hear you dude. I hear you on that but what I would recommend is just literally ignoring the pain doing it anyway
01:02:17 I've I've been there. I have lifted done specifically with leg works out
01:02:21 I've done it and felt like sheer agony unable to walk straight without limping for like a day or two
01:02:26 But then I like it's been two days. It's time to do legs again
01:02:29 I do it again through the pain like it feels like sheer agony
01:02:33 Except when I actually start to do the actual movement of the lift itself
01:02:38 I have felt like the pain kind of goes away and then after the workout things have started to feel better
01:02:42 So I really think just doing it kind of mixes up the lactic acid gets it out a little bit
01:02:47 And like helps you move along towards recovery. I don't know about you
01:02:50 But for me, how much pain like bothers me depends on whether or not I know or slash think it's bad or good for me
01:02:57 Like there's a pain that all bothers me unconditionally
01:03:00 If it's pain, it bothers me
01:03:03 No, like if I'm feeling sore after a workout, it's like good because like I know that it's good for me
01:03:08 Whereas like if I'm if I'm getting like, you know
01:03:11 If if I'm going to the doctors and like getting a shot like the pain of the needle entering my skin is the worst feeling in the world
01:03:17 You guys you guys should see ben you guys should see ben when he needs to get a shot
01:03:21 He is the biggest spaz in the world. I've been I've been better. You know the last time I got a shot. I was way better
01:03:28 All right, that's great
01:03:30 I'm really freaked out when when when I don't what were you been there for?
01:03:33 We were getting shots together. I I don't know. It might have just been that time
01:03:38 We were going full gay or something. I don't know. Yeah
01:03:41 We were getting our age shots
01:03:43 um
01:03:44 I've been doing exercises for like I think like almost a month and a week now
01:03:50 um
01:03:52 You know like I've never really done any sort of regimented exercise before
01:03:56 And the first few days, um, it was mostly my legs. I was doing and my legs felt really heavy
01:04:01 Yeah, and it was weird like all the time. They're really heavy and then
01:04:05 I just sort of got used to them being heavy and now I realize that it's just because there is more muscle there
01:04:11 And my legs are no longer just sticks
01:04:13 Well, okay, too. It doesn't it doesn't hurt at all. It's just they feel like
01:04:18 Like they feel normal. Mm-hmm, but they don't feel like they've gotten lighter at all
01:04:23 Well, okay, sure, but just as a public service announcement
01:04:26 You can really only expect to gain like maybe a pound of total body mass
01:04:32 When you're working out at first, you know, we're talking about noob gains or something
01:04:35 You know that that is true noobs do gain faster significantly no no no no noob noob gains means that
01:04:41 Noob gains isn't about putting on muscle noob gains is about your lifts going up
01:04:44 And it's because you're right. Am I right here? That that's definitely true. You know that that actually might be right
01:04:49 All I know is that it happened really fast. Okay, well, you know, I'm not gonna question it. I'll believe it
01:04:53 If they feel heavier sure, okay
01:04:56 I mean, I have like really
01:04:58 Skinny legs forever. So what's that line from get action?
01:05:02 Creativity is a muscle and da da da da. I'm just gonna jack it something like that
01:05:07 I know the line because I wrote it, but I don't feel like telling you
01:05:11 Oh
01:05:14 This show sucks get out of here
01:05:16 When you go back to just interrupt me anyways, why don't you go be uh back to fucking burger king you piece of shit
01:05:24 It's sorry about interrupting you
01:05:27 I don't work
01:05:30 That burger king
01:05:32 I
01:05:38 Sounds like a sheep he does
01:05:42 Uh, are we going anywhere with this where no, I feel I feel like we're we've just been saying things about a clean hour
01:05:49 We've got a clean. It's very clean at that time. Yeah
01:05:53 I um
01:05:54 What else could we even talk about specifically?
01:05:58 Oh, wait, wait, wait. Jesse was gonna tell us about his nightmare of a burger run that he did before this
01:06:04 What happened with that shit? I don't know. You know, I had some wacky rant, but uh, oh come on
01:06:11 Come on
01:06:16 I stopped caring pretty quickly. I went to get a hamburger
01:06:21 Well, look, this is why uh, you know the trick to losing weight
01:06:25 Is to not eat
01:06:27 And that's pretty easy because eating is a tiresome burden
01:06:30 And it's miserable and no one should do it the act of getting food
01:06:35 Is usually so miserable that it makes the act of eating food not even fun
01:06:40 Like I had to get a hamburger today
01:06:42 I ordered it from the burger bar
01:06:45 So I get in my car. I'm driving to the burger bar to pick up my burger
01:06:49 There's all this traffic
01:06:50 I could have just walked there in half the time that it took the drive there. I'm hitting every red light
01:06:55 I can't park anywhere. There's like some weird halloween festival going on. There's cars everywhere
01:07:00 There's a fucking beer tent set up in like the entire parking lot
01:07:04 So I got a like I got a park halfway across town
01:07:06 I could have walked there in the time to get my burger
01:07:08 I get into the burger place the guy behind the bar. He's fucking ignoring me. I'm like, yeah, I can see my burger
01:07:14 I can see my burger behind the bar and the guy's just walking around and he finally he takes my card
01:07:20 He takes my debit card. I'm paying for my burger
01:07:24 But then he starts shaking drinks and mixing drinks and fucking around and doing all this bullshit
01:07:29 He's gotten my debit card. I've paid for my burger. I can see my burger. Just give it to me
01:07:35 Just give it to me and he goes to the cash register
01:07:38 He's finally about to start, you know, entering the shit with my debit card and he fucking answers his phone
01:07:44 Oh, yeah
01:07:46 A bartender answered his phone at the bar while I was trying to pay for my burger and then he turns around
01:07:55 After he's done on his phone
01:07:56 He's finally, you know, punching in my numbers in the stupid cash register. He turns around and looks at me
01:08:02 He says some stuff at me
01:08:03 He starts speaking in tongues in this bizarre alien language with like this weird goofy smile on his face
01:08:10 Like he's conversing with me. He thinks in his mind
01:08:13 He's speaking English, but he's like having a stroke or something. He's looking at me and I swear to God. He's going
01:08:17 Ah
01:08:24 And I'm just like, why what are you saying? What do you want me to say? I'm just like nodding and being like, yeah
01:08:31 burger boy, yeah
01:08:34 And he's fucking so then he's like, okay, uh, do you want to buy a burger by ketchup packets?
01:08:41 He's like monkey man. It's like a tick to this guy. You want to need a burger boy ketchup packets?
01:08:45 It's like, yes, I'd like some ketchup packets, please
01:08:48 Finally I get home. I open my I open my burger boy container
01:08:53 And I'm trying to get my burger. I look at the ketchup packets. There's like one ketchup packet. There's six mustard packets
01:09:01 Oh, no, I didn't ask for mustard. I didn't want mustard. I don't like mustard
01:09:06 I hate him. So now I strongly dislike mustard. That's I'm never fucking eating again
01:09:13 I'll never be a burger boy as long as I live. I'm a ham boy and only a ham boy for the rest of my life
01:09:18 Crucial crucial difference between a hamburger boy and a ham boy. That guy can never be a ham boy
01:09:24 A hamburger boy is not a good one. I don't know what a ham
01:09:27 I don't know what a burger boy is, but I don't want it anywhere near me a ham boy
01:09:30 You can trust a burger boy is some kind of child molesting monster from hell
01:09:35 I don't like him
01:09:37 But that's why you should never eat. That's why everyone should go on a strict
01:09:40 Um anorexia diet. It's the it's the diet that works. That's the campaign slogan that I invented for my invention of anorexia
01:09:50 You know, I I know that guy and I asked him what he was he was speaking burger boy language
01:09:56 And I asked him so what were you actually saying to just he said he was like what I was saying was jesse
01:10:01 Why don't you go back to work?
01:10:03 at burger king
01:10:05 No burger boy. No, I told you once I told you
01:10:10 I don't work at burger king
01:10:12 And you know, okay on a serious note, uh about this whole not eating thing jesse is actually
01:10:20 Jesse is actually let me just say real quick if if I had to get in my fucking car and drive to eat
01:10:24 I would never eat because fuck that. Yeah, that's why it's terrible that I keep that
01:10:28 We have all this food in the house that I have food in my fridge. I gotta stop. It's a meal that needs to die
01:10:32 Agree, but but okay, uh the the whole thing we've talked a lot about lifting
01:10:37 But the thing is if your goal is just to lose weight
01:10:41 Uh, the what just eat like the the food is what makes the difference just figure out what you're eating wrong
01:10:46 Eat less calories just eat like half of what you're eating now
01:10:49 That's that's the way to do it a lot a lot of people think that just losing weight is a good goal when for most people
01:10:55 It's not most most people should be if they want to look better
01:10:58 A lot of people think they'll look better just by losing weight
01:11:01 But really everyone should be trying to gain muscle too because it's always good
01:11:05 Everyone thinks it's everyone thinks it's less important, but it's more important in my humble opinion more important than you know viewer
01:11:10 I I'm more I'm talking to like the fat people right now who are seriously looking to lose weight
01:11:15 I think people really need to spread the word it needs to be made
01:11:19 More people need to be made aware of the fact
01:11:22 That losing weight is the easiest fucking thing in the world
01:11:26 It's not difficult anyone who says it's too hard to lose weight is a whiner and a fool
01:11:31 You know memes really reinforce themselves is just is just eat less shitty food or just not eat at all
01:11:37 It's so easy you see food and instead of sticking it into your craw you don't stick it into your craw
01:11:43 And that's all you have to do. It's zero effort
01:11:46 It is a massively destructive meme out there about like the incredible difficulty involved in losing weight when like you said
01:11:54 It really is not that complicated if you put a little bit of thought into it a couple months ago
01:12:00 I just got bored of being fat. You know it was funny for a while
01:12:04 You know I I figured you know everyone every every great artist should have their fat years
01:12:09 It's it's you know
01:12:11 It there's a novelty to being chiefly for a little bit. You're like, yeah
01:12:15 I can sit around in my chiefly body
01:12:17 And I can you know I can have the women flock to me because women love a man who's well fed
01:12:22 They love the the biggest man in the tribe
01:12:25 But you know after a while the novelty wears off. I'm like, okay. I'm bored. So I just decided one day. I'm done
01:12:31 So I fucking stopped eating. I lost 30 pounds in like one day. It was the easiest thing in the world
01:12:38 He cut his leg off he got his leg off
01:12:41 Rad con I go to rad con and you know rad con is like my week and a half of decadence while I'm there
01:12:46 I I gain like like a bunch of you know, first of all, I went from like in a couple months
01:12:51 I went from 225 to 195 and I was feeling good. I'm like, yeah, awesome. I'm the best at this. It's super easy. I'm cool
01:12:57 I'm smart. I'm bad. I'm cool. I'm nobody's fool. So then I go to rad con. I'm like, okay
01:13:01 I'm gonna shove all the fucking food in my mouth. I don't give a shit. I'm at rad con. It's party time party central
01:13:06 Drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. Do I like to party? The answer is yes shove it all in me, baby
01:13:12 So I'm I'm I'm going to rad con. I so I I get I get a little way to rad con
01:13:16 I went from 195 to by the time I got home from rad con. I was like 205 again
01:13:22 Mm-hmm. So I get home
01:13:24 But then within a fucking week of getting back to my old habits. I'm back to 195 again
01:13:29 So it's so fucking easy even if you fucking splurge and get fat again for like one week
01:13:34 It doesn't even matter. You just stop eating again. These things are always fixable. It's always fixable
01:13:39 There's no need to despair. You know, it's always always always I was saying earlier. There's always room for mistakes
01:13:45 There's always room for a fun week of decadence and splurging
01:13:49 Anorexia
01:13:51 Invented by Jesse Wood
01:13:53 The diet that works and I just put that on a t-shirt. It's just important to think of of eating as a part of like
01:13:59 The mechanism of your body. It's not just indulgence that you do three times a day of having infinite fun. It's important
01:14:05 You know, that's what I want people to know. I promise everyone
01:14:07 Everyone in the audience if you stop drinking soda, you will just
01:14:13 Naturally lose like 10 pounds join the water club, baby
01:14:16 Every time I've ever started drinking soda. I've gotten like fatter instantly and every time I've stopped drinking soda
01:14:23 I've gotten thinner instantly like it's
01:14:26 Unbelievable drunk. I've probably drunk less than a hundred sodas in my entire life because I just don't like them
01:14:32 Yeah, that's that's pretty good. That's probably why I'm so skinny
01:14:35 I drink a soda now and it's just I think I had a soda when I was like a year place
01:14:38 There was dr. Piper like I haven't had in a while gross way too sweet. Can't it's like drinking a syrup of sugar can't do it
01:14:44 But whatever it's not about me. Incidentally, if you're an alcoholic like me scale back your drinking to once a week
01:14:50 It helps also
01:14:51 Drinking is like a lot of calories a lot of calories in that alcohol
01:14:56 Also, you might be interested to know that alcohol is
01:15:00 Technically a poison only in the sense that it has no nutritional value whatsoever
01:15:05 And is converted directly into fat the alcohol calories are nothing else happens with them
01:15:11 Other than the mechanism of your body processes those calories into fat
01:15:15 There's like nothing else happens with them. They just get stored as fat
01:15:18 It's interesting and that's the same with sugar sugar is the exact same way
01:15:22 Yeah, I was gonna say yeah
01:15:23 Carbs do that too. I think well it depends on the type of carb, but but yeah, like is that right?
01:15:28 Yeah, there's a little bit of a difference into what they do, but whatever anyway closing statement viewer
01:15:34 If you're worried about getting healthy fuck off just go lift
01:15:38 Just lift and don't worry about anything else. Everything else will take care of itself. That's what I think
01:15:42 I would say just eat right and don't worry about lifting that much worry about that later
01:15:47 Okay, so let me get nothing and lift all the time. Yeah
01:15:50 So if you are if you are at home if you think if you think you have a fitness problem
01:15:55 You do but no matter what the problem is you will find that lifting is the solution
01:16:01 Here's my tip and all other paths will become clear to you of all the solutions all the plans you could do
01:16:06 Do whichever one is easiest like if you love soda you love chips
01:16:10 You love Fritos, whichever one you love the least try to stop eating that one. That's how I've done everything
01:16:16 I've just been like I'm not when I started like you know, I quit my job
01:16:20 So I had the baseline of having had a blue collar job for energy usage
01:16:24 But now I'm like, all right, I'm going to try doing push-ups and setups and stuff like that
01:16:28 But I'm not going to give it any schedule because I know I'm not going to be able to do a schedule
01:16:32 I'm just going to do it randomly whenever I remember to do it
01:16:36 And I has such low expectations for myself. I was able to exceed my expectations all the time and it was awesome
01:16:43 Yeah, excellent. Yes. Take it small steps. Couldn't agree more. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it
01:16:49 Or you could be a hero like me and make spreadsheets and do everything
01:16:52 You know hardcore all the time be the strongest man in the world. Yeah, that's also possible too
01:16:55 Or just take a start like that though. Yes. I started as a guy. I was born a god and I've been one my entire life
01:17:02 Or just take up smoking. It makes you less hungry
01:17:05 Nate you were you were never you were
01:17:08 You've always been you've always been fit-looking, but like yes before you ever lifted you were like skinny skinny ripped
01:17:16 And then now that you lift you're like muscle ripped
01:17:19 He went from a Simone to a Kamina is basically what you're saying
01:17:23 Oh, don't don't sell Kami to that short by saying my current body can rival the god himself one day
01:17:28 I'll be a one day. I'm gonna do a the reason I lift is so that I can do a good Kami to cosplay one day
01:17:34 And one day I will no I can't I'm not fit enough not even close. I have to be twice my size
01:17:38 You were kind of fat. Yeah, Nate's not cut enough for it yet. I'm cutting right now. He has been he has been
01:17:44 I need bigger shoulders too to be like Kami, but whatever. Anyway
01:17:46 Oh, whatever you think Kamino would fucking worry about the size of his shoulders. I want to look like him and I know what he looks like
01:17:51 Hey, yeah, you know what you know what?
01:17:54 Oh, god the closing statement on all this. Um
01:17:57 People that lift to be cool. Yeah, you know what's way cooler than being fit is not is not worrying about being fit
01:18:04 Worrying about how you look is way more uncool than being fit is cool
01:18:09 Well, if you're like me and you bottle it up and never tell anyone then it's perfect
01:18:13 Then if you just pretend then you're just then you're just secret uncool
01:18:17 That's fine. I'm prepared for that
01:18:20 Absolutely like he said it's about other people thinking that's right. That's right
01:18:25 We've been we've been we've been talking. You know what? We've gotten off topic the real topic here
01:18:29 I don't know why I haven't pushed this harder the real the real truth of the matter
01:18:33 Is that none of it matters and being fits not important and if you think it is then you're not cool. Yeah, you know for me
01:18:38 It was that's only if your priority is happiness
01:18:41 Right. Mm-hmm, which is not for me. It was like I think it should be for anyone
01:18:44 It does not believe in happiness. Nope
01:18:47 Everyone everyone in the world is just a pile of misplaced priorities. Like people that's true
01:18:52 People think they have to lose weight. They're wrong. They actually just need to lift
01:18:56 But then that whole thing is based on thinking you need to be fit
01:18:59 But that's wrong. You just need to fucking not be a little bitch and not worry about how you look
01:19:04 That's how that's the truth. Honestly. Honestly. I think being fit is kind of gay
01:19:10 Or no, I think I think being ripped. I think I think working out too much or I think I think like
01:19:15 No, that's I've only seen sometimes
01:19:17 I think it's the only way in my life to this point that I've seen other naked men has been at gyms
01:19:22 So that's hashtag pretty gay. You know, hashtag pretty gay. I don't know
01:19:26 You know what? I think I think there's a suite. All right. There's just way too many closing statements
01:19:29 So we're gonna wrap this up now. There's a sweet. There's a sweet spot of how much you should worry about fitness
01:19:34 And I think I am I am under that bar. I am I am worrying not enough right now
01:19:39 But there is definitely you can definitely worry too much. Sure. Okay. All right. All right. Yeah, I agreed
01:19:45 All right, we're done. Fuck fitness. All right. Thanks for listening everybody. We will yeah hashtag fuck fitness. We'll see you next time
01:19:51 Thanks for listening everybody say bye. Bye
