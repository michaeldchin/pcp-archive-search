00:00:00 Now, this video was just me throwing out my own personal opinion, with no intent to shove my thought down anyone's throats,
00:00:07 or to persuade anyone to feel bad for having different tastes from me.
00:00:12 However, that doesn't seem to be how a lot of people interpreted it.
00:00:17 Commenters, please kill yourselves and free me from this living hell.
00:00:22 If your comment is mean and snide, then you can just fuck off and die.
00:00:27 Why do you feel entitled to spewing your bullshit attitude?
00:00:32 You're rude and crude and I hate you, so kill yourselves please and be cool.
00:00:37 I pronounced the word wrong, I don't care.
00:00:41 I didn't represent you, yeah, no shit, I am myself motherfucker.
00:00:46 Think I got a bad attitude, well you ain't seen shit.
00:00:51 A shadow banned your ass to deal with it.
00:00:55 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the process.
00:01:01 I am the best guy ever and we're joined today by Munchy where his tiny ass.
00:01:07 I've made it an irreplaceable hobby of mine to just draw and doodle on Pokemon cards
00:01:14 and sell them at a profit at local schools and flooding the market with my own artistic mashup pieces
00:01:19 on top of Geodudes and Machobs.
00:01:22 Excellent, Hippocrates is here.
00:01:25 Commenter rules, more like commenter eulogy, if you know what I'm saying.
00:01:31 Yes, excellent. Tom Oliver is here.
00:01:34 I just woke up, but I'm here anyway, I'm going to do it, I'm going to comment on comments.
00:01:42 And Ben St.
00:01:45 No comments.
00:01:48 Because I haven't heard the whole podcast yet.
00:01:52 Oh excellent, that's a good one.
00:01:54 Incidentally, this is the procrastinator's podcast, a podcast with a bunch of internet boys
00:01:59 who are just here to talk about a bunch of stuff that we like, we all make stuff and we're all here.
00:02:04 Spread our intellect across the interweb.
00:02:08 I just looked at my hand and there's blood all over it, I should be fine, but I'm scared.
00:02:14 I think they're already fighting back.
00:02:17 Oh yeah, they're attacking from the future.
00:02:20 I will say I've bled on the PCP more times and I've bled off the PCP, that's not a joke, that's accurate.
00:02:29 Okay, I was going to say I've made your woman bleed, but I don't know why I was going to say that.
00:02:34 That would be hard to understand.
00:02:40 So today, we're talking about, it's Commentary Rules Number Two.
00:02:43 Commentary Rules Two everybody.
00:02:45 It's been a long time coming.
00:02:47 Yeah, Commentary Rules is one of our most proudest grace achievements from the past, from the good old days
00:02:55 when this podcast had a real good fan base and everyone was real nice and it was a great popular time
00:03:00 but now we're just surrounded by fools and geeks and goblins and everyone hates us now.
00:03:06 One of our seminal works for sure.
00:03:10 And just as a fun history lesson, I'm just going back, I've got it pulled up here.
00:03:14 That was episode 14 of the PCP and I think this is episode 85 that this is going to be.
00:03:20 Yeah, I think that's right.
00:03:22 Yeah, and that was on April 3rd of 2016 that came out, so it's been almost two years.
00:03:28 Look at year and a half, I guess, which is a long time.
00:03:31 We've been doing this thing for quite a while now, fellas.
00:03:33 Jesus fucking Christ.
00:03:34 And exactly what do we have to show for it?
00:03:36 Absolutely nothing.
00:03:37 Yeah, it's pretty sick.
00:03:38 The comments have indeed descended.
00:03:40 Our old selves would be so ashamed of our current comment section.
00:03:43 That's true.
00:03:44 You guys made a vow to ban all the people who disrespected and disregarded your Commentary Rules
00:03:50 and I think it's time we reinstate those rules and then stay true to our word.
00:03:55 You're not wrong.
00:03:56 I'm for savage law enforcement.
00:03:58 I'm for some excessive force.
00:04:01 With the release of the...
00:04:03 I've come to a new appreciation of respecting the law after the Mad Bull, you know,
00:04:08 Plebe and the Weeb has come out, so yeah.
00:04:11 Well, I mean, you were there.
00:04:12 It's not like now that you've...
00:04:14 Well, you just reminded of it, I guess.
00:04:17 The first time didn't do the trick, but the second time was really the charm for experiencing it.
00:04:23 To learn what Mad Bull was trying to teach us all along.
00:04:26 Let me tell you this right now, commenters.
00:04:29 After we're done with you, you're just going to be shouting Michael Brown in the fucking streets
00:04:32 because we're going to use excessive force.
00:04:34 You're going to be saying to the hands up, please kill me.
00:04:38 Before we get into any of the discussion about Commentary Entitlement and Commentary Rules,
00:04:45 I would just like to make a motion to ban any retarded offline analogies to like parties or shopping malls
00:04:52 or any sort of like non-literal, non-virtual, non-multiplayer focused first-person shooter,
00:04:57 like apartheid simulator.
00:04:59 They all get muddled and argued upon on the basis of their semantics
00:05:02 and they actually get to the point of the heart of the issue
00:05:04 and turn the entire thing into like a big old farce.
00:05:06 Let's keep things real, literal, and argue about things that are like comments in the real world
00:05:11 as they appear not in fantasy lands.
00:05:14 I don't understand.
00:05:16 I'll do my dance.
00:05:18 There was a lot of analogies made and we went around in circles.
00:05:22 There's an inherent difference between someone saying words and you reading text.
00:05:28 There's an inherent difference in which you keep the internet issues
00:05:31 in the context of them being on the internet.
00:05:34 Oh, I see.
00:05:35 Yeah, all right, sure.
00:05:36 That's our focus here.
00:05:37 That's what we do.
00:05:38 That's where we live.
00:05:39 Okay, understood.
00:05:40 So one of the reasons that we bring this up is because there's been a couple of discussions,
00:05:44 as Monchi just said, about a commenter entitlement.
00:05:48 Both Digi made a couple of videos.
00:05:50 He made one, people responded, and then he made a response to the responses to his video about that issue.
00:05:55 And Davoo also made one.
00:05:57 So you can go check out their channels if you want to see what they're talking about.
00:06:00 Yes, those videos will be relevantly linked in the description for you to go look at.
00:06:04 If you remember that, I'll put it in.
00:06:06 I'll log in and put it in.
00:06:08 Okay, all right.
00:06:09 Yeah, great.
00:06:10 Yeah, they're good context for this.
00:06:12 So that's sort of, there's been, you know, we've all evolved.
00:06:15 It's been like a year and a half, over a year and a half since the first commenter rules.
00:06:18 We've all grown, things have changed on the PCP and in our lives,
00:06:22 and we've all got new things to drink at the table.
00:06:24 And the hot topic right now is this commenter entitlement.
00:06:28 So I don't know, Monchi, you want to tell us what you know about this?
00:06:31 How do you stand on this?
00:06:32 Where do I stand on commenters as a whole or with commenter entitlement as described?
00:06:38 I guess specifically entitlement, but wherever you want, really.
00:06:41 I am a pro comment boy.
00:06:44 I'm one of the least, I guess, hawkish of my comments.
00:06:50 But then again, I guess that's because I'm the little guy.
00:06:52 I don't have a lot of comments to police.
00:06:54 But as a whole, I see a lot of good things come out of comments.
00:07:00 I like reading good comments, and I very rarely get bad comments.
00:07:04 And whenever I do, they don't really impact me as much as my other people.
00:07:08 I mean, I always want to salute you that despite the fact that Andrew Hussey
00:07:11 incessantly shitposts on every episode of Armour Travel that comes out,
00:07:15 you retain your strength and you're a respect for the law,
00:07:19 and you don't ban him out.
00:07:21 How would it reflect on me to destroy the person who's given me so much,
00:07:27 a.k.a. Brahmal, my favorite webcomic artist?
00:07:31 Yeah, commenter entitlement.
00:07:35 I think it's really up to the creator to do it every once.
00:07:39 I just like comments. I just like comments a lot.
00:07:42 So I don't like when they go.
00:07:44 I think I'm the only person who likes to see comments
00:07:46 and I would be sad if they were all deleted and disabled.
00:07:49 Well, all right, as a other, like, small-ish YouTuber,
00:07:53 I agree that sometimes, like, for me personally,
00:07:56 the comments on my videos are so few that, you know,
00:08:01 there aren't that many really bad ones and there are, you know,
00:08:05 there's quite a lot of good ones and it's nice to read all of them.
00:08:08 If I had a video that was, like, actually popular with hundreds of thousands of views
00:08:13 getting comments all the time, I would not want to see any of them.
00:08:17 They would be terrible and I would want to disable the comments.
00:08:21 Just because I've seen on other people's channels how absolutely terrible it is
00:08:26 and I can't imagine having that as, like, a notification stream for me.
00:08:31 I don't want that. So, like, I see both sides of it.
00:08:34 Yeah, well, you know, I mean, none of us are huge YouTubers,
00:08:37 especially on this right now.
00:08:38 Digi, of course, is the biggest of us who's historically gotten the most comments.
00:08:42 I currently, I think, anyway, have the second biggest channel.
00:08:45 Actually, Mage might be ahead of me at something.
00:08:47 I think she is. Last I knew.
00:08:49 I think she is. But in any case, like, the point is I am starting to get to the point where
00:08:53 I still actually get notifications to my phone every time I get a comment,
00:08:58 just because I enjoy reading them. And that's the thing.
00:09:00 I'm starting to get comments, like, every, I don't know,
00:09:03 every couple of hours I get a notification that I've got a new comment,
00:09:06 which is a pretty steady stream of them.
00:09:08 And I definitely get some bad ones, some annoying ones, especially when...
00:09:13 Well, here's what it comes down to.
00:09:15 Like, the bigger your audience gets, the more, like, normal randos
00:09:20 who don't really know your history or your thing and are just likeable,
00:09:24 are likely to take the least charitable interpretation of your content possible,
00:09:28 or a less one, you know, they have less context.
00:09:31 Like, for example, I just made a video about how I hate League of Legends.
00:09:34 It was inevitable that a lot of people who like League of Legends,
00:09:37 you know, want to protest against this and call me an asshole, call me a piece of shit,
00:09:40 say that I'm being a bully.
00:09:42 Absolutely fools.
00:09:43 Monsters, little trolls, little goblins.
00:09:46 And I don't like hearing them.
00:09:51 You know, I don't like hearing people insult me or tell me that I'm wrong and stuff,
00:09:54 but it's still worth it for me at this point to get the comments,
00:09:58 because I do see people agree.
00:10:00 And, you know, I get a little endorphin rush when I see a comment,
00:10:03 so I still like that. That's still fun.
00:10:05 I think I just want to say for myself,
00:10:09 the only reason I create any art or show my face in any public scenario whatsoever
00:10:14 or even wake up in the morning is so people can say that they like me
00:10:17 and that they think I'm doing a good job.
00:10:19 Of course.
00:10:20 That's the only reason I do anything in my entire life.
00:10:22 I think a lot of people agree on that.
00:10:25 Whenever I get a good comment, that validates me making the art in the first place.
00:10:29 That's the only reason I fucking do literally anything.
00:10:32 Well, here, let me counter-argue.
00:10:35 I don't necessarily agree with the subtext that I think I'm hearing
00:10:40 in what you guys, especially you Nate, are saying.
00:10:43 I don't think that a comment that disagrees with you is bad.
00:10:49 Not only do I not think it's a quote-unquote bad comment,
00:10:53 like a shitty comment by an asshole,
00:10:55 I don't even see it as like a negative thing,
00:10:57 because I don't know, that's discussion.
00:10:59 And if people are discussing your content,
00:11:01 even if they're disagreeing with you,
00:11:04 that's still like a mark, that's still good.
00:11:08 I hear what you're saying, but your biggest video is your Christian lecture,
00:11:12 and there are plenty of comments on that,
00:11:14 like look at these autistic assholes.
00:11:17 I love those. I actually love those.
00:11:21 You love them, huh?
00:11:23 I mean, it's really funny, and I'm not insulted,
00:11:27 because I know this person has no idea what they're talking about.
00:11:30 And you know, I am a big loser, so fair enough, fair play on their part.
00:11:35 I don't know.
00:11:37 I guess a little part of me is bothered by it,
00:11:40 but a much bigger part of me is like...
00:11:44 When it comes to the subject of mean people,
00:11:49 I notice a lot in my comic session.
00:11:54 A lot of people trying to be ironically mean,
00:11:57 and I guess I kind of parade that air around me,
00:12:00 so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised when that happens.
00:12:03 But there's a clear distinction in my mind
00:12:07 between a bad comment and a comment that is mean,
00:12:11 or a bad one, since it doesn't like the video.
00:12:14 It's completely fine, and I don't care,
00:12:17 and it doesn't even bug me at all when someone doesn't like the video.
00:12:21 I obviously, as I say before, I live for the compliments,
00:12:24 but you know, just because someone doesn't like it,
00:12:26 it's not going to be the end of the world for me.
00:12:28 What I don't like is the le epic, funny, mean comments
00:12:33 that are trying to be cutesy and get me to like them
00:12:36 by being rude and weird.
00:12:39 A lot of the time on Armitrable,
00:12:42 most of the time Armitrable comments are fantastic,
00:12:45 and I love them, but every once in a while,
00:12:47 there's a really weird, snooty comment that I don't understand.
00:12:50 That's one of the main things.
00:12:52 I understand a lot of the comments made by bizarre people,
00:12:56 and it really, I just want a comment section
00:12:59 full of people who not just like what I like,
00:13:02 or you know, like what I put out, I mean, you know, I would like that,
00:13:05 but I just want ones where I can understand what they're saying,
00:13:09 and you know, I think like, you know, the autistic,
00:13:12 look at all these autistic people.
00:13:14 I would get annoyed by that, but I don't think,
00:13:17 like if it was just, you know, some funny comment
00:13:20 that was negatively impacting, you know,
00:13:22 it was negative on the video itself.
00:13:24 I wouldn't get mad at that.
00:13:26 I don't think that's immune from me liking that comment.
00:13:28 It all just depends on the context of the comment, you know?
00:13:31 Well, I know what you're saying.
00:13:33 Yeah, I do, and I think that's a good way to segue into
00:13:36 like the describing of the actual entitlement phenomenon
00:13:40 that's been discussed recently.
00:13:42 So like, you're talking about not liking, you know,
00:13:45 certain people who post particularly like me-me comments,
00:13:48 or people like trying to bait out upvotes and whatnot,
00:13:51 and that's sort of the issue that Digi was talking about
00:13:54 and DeVue and whatnot.
00:13:56 So the specific discussion that's been about the entitlement
00:13:59 of commenters is that, so right now,
00:14:02 YouTube is built in such a way that the comments are basically
00:14:05 an intrinsic part of every YouTube video,
00:14:08 and what Digi is talking about in his discussion is that
00:14:11 things do not have to be that way.
00:14:14 There could be social, not even social media,
00:14:16 but there could be like video uploading platforms
00:14:19 that simply do not have a comment section
00:14:21 and contrary to people's belief,
00:14:23 that does not violate your First Amendment rights
00:14:26 or any of those ridiculous claims that some people say.
00:14:28 That's, you know, that's not how that works.
00:14:30 And if someone chooses to close the comments, again,
00:14:33 that is not violating your rights,
00:14:36 because as Digi says repeatedly,
00:14:38 you can just go anywhere else you want
00:14:40 and make a comment on Reddit, on your Facebook,
00:14:42 you know, whatever you want to do.
00:14:44 The platform specifically allows for comments to be curated
00:14:48 and for comment sections to be closed.
00:14:50 I don't understand how you can argue
00:14:52 that it's wrong to do that in any way.
00:14:54 All of us here are totally comfortable.
00:14:56 It's not really like that it's wrong.
00:14:58 I mean, most people, I don't know whether they actually think
00:15:01 it's wrong to close comments,
00:15:03 but they do think that it's cowardly,
00:15:05 because it implies things.
00:15:07 There's just like this arrow of like,
00:15:10 I can't take it, therefore, I'm closing the comments,
00:15:13 which isn't true, it's just I would rather not.
00:15:16 This is the big issue at the heart of this.
00:15:18 Do commenters deserve to have comments?
00:15:21 Commenters don't deserve anything.
00:15:23 The word deserve, the word deserve there is the critical one there,
00:15:25 because again, the commenting is honestly, it is a privilege.
00:15:28 It is not a right.
00:15:30 Someone has to choose to give it to you.
00:15:32 But hang on, I think Tom is going to say something.
00:15:34 Tom, did you want to jump in?
00:15:36 Well, I was just going to say that I feel like we're talking,
00:15:39 like, I haven't watched Digi's videos,
00:15:41 and I probably should have.
00:15:42 I just watched Davoo's.
00:15:44 But in terms of just what we're talking about with comments
00:15:47 and how Digi is saying,
00:15:51 like we need a platform where comments aren't a thing,
00:15:54 like YouTube can be that,
00:15:56 like you can have your entire channel have no comments
00:15:59 if you want to have your content presented in that context.
00:16:02 Yeah, but I think Digi's responding to the attitude people have,
00:16:06 where like they would call him like, you know,
00:16:08 a failure or a coward, or fighting their rights.
00:16:10 I mean, I guess my perspective on all this is that,
00:16:13 like, I would never close my comment section because
00:16:15 Yeah, but why does it have to be?
00:16:17 Of course they would do that.
00:16:19 Like, why can't we try and change their mind?
00:16:21 Because here's the thing.
00:16:23 Like, you're saying how people come into YouTube
00:16:26 and have this, like,
00:16:28 and they have like this expectation of comments.
00:16:31 But like, you're coming in here onto the platform of YouTube,
00:16:34 which is a social network,
00:16:36 which has this whole community aspect.
00:16:38 Like, you're coming onto this platform
00:16:40 and people are coming to you with the expectation
00:16:42 to be part of the conversation.
00:16:44 Like, that's why YouTube is successful
00:16:46 and that's why people like it.
00:16:47 It's because you have this, like,
00:16:49 smaller barrier of entry to, like, talking to a creator.
00:16:52 And while that's where you can argue the merits
00:16:55 of whether that's good or bad, that's the expectation.
00:16:57 That's why people are here.
00:16:59 And that's why people like comments,
00:17:01 is because they want to be able to be part of the discussion of the video.
00:17:03 You are completely right.
00:17:04 And I'm sure that played some role
00:17:06 in the growth of YouTube up to this point.
00:17:08 I couldn't agree more.
00:17:09 That's definitely a plus that draws people to this website.
00:17:11 That ability to relate to what people are saying.
00:17:14 And I think guys like Digi might actually be undercounting.
00:17:16 If there was a platform where people couldn't comment,
00:17:18 they might be less likely to actually get into it,
00:17:21 because, you know, they want to be part of the conversation.
00:17:23 Well, I mean, because you think of, like, something like Netflix.
00:17:25 Netflix doesn't have comments or anything.
00:17:27 People can't comment on, like, the content and stuff.
00:17:29 So it's a totally different feel in terms of, like,
00:17:32 a platform that versus YouTube.
00:17:34 It's like gun control.
00:17:36 Like, fucking comments are guns.
00:17:39 And as Americans, you have comments.
00:17:42 You have guns.
00:17:43 You can't take that away.
00:17:45 When people know they can have guns,
00:17:47 it's impossible to take them away.
00:17:49 But in countries that have never really had guns,
00:17:51 like the UK, I mean, we aren't clamoring for them.
00:17:54 We just, you know, they're just not a thing you can have.
00:17:57 You just really, really would like them.
00:17:59 You really like to be able to kill everyone.
00:18:01 Yeah, well, that's the thing.
00:18:03 I don't, I don't think about...
00:18:05 No, Toria's school shooter Hippocrates.
00:18:07 Why is guns in the UK?
00:18:08 I'm never, I'm never, like, thinking,
00:18:10 man, I really should, I really should,
00:18:12 to have a shotgun right now.
00:18:14 I really want that.
00:18:15 But it never comes up.
00:18:17 Well, the difference is just that, like, there's a...
00:18:19 I mean, it kind of isn't tried in law.
00:18:21 If I said no world, like, real life analogies, guys.
00:18:24 I know, but I thought it was funny.
00:18:26 But the point is, the point is,
00:18:28 comments are a thing.
00:18:30 Changing the public perception would be nice,
00:18:32 but it's kind of impossible to, like,
00:18:34 make people think that turning off the comments
00:18:36 isn't, uh, I don't know,
00:18:38 whatever, cowardly, or whatever they would think.
00:18:40 But it's impossible to change that completely.
00:18:43 But I think there should be some sort of, like,
00:18:46 you need, um, you know, 10,000 subs
00:18:49 in order to comment on this video.
00:18:51 Like, just some sort of, like, way to...
00:18:53 That would essentially be the exact same thing.
00:18:56 Because, like, 99% of people don't have 10,000 subs.
00:19:00 The majority of people who use YouTube
00:19:02 use it as a content consumption platform only.
00:19:05 Yeah.
00:19:06 So, right.
00:19:07 My problem with comments is that
00:19:10 they don't have one defined purpose.
00:19:13 There's sort of a weird limbo of, like,
00:19:15 sometimes, like, messages directed towards the author.
00:19:19 Sometimes messages, like, discussing the content.
00:19:22 Sometimes, like, meta messages about the comments themselves.
00:19:27 And, you know, a whole range of spectrum in between them.
00:19:30 Yeah.
00:19:31 It's just kind of a cluster of comments.
00:19:32 Well, that's just what happens when you have an open forum.
00:19:34 You just have people doing their own thing.
00:19:35 I know.
00:19:36 Well, I don't like it.
00:19:37 You know, it's not good.
00:19:38 I mean, yeah.
00:19:39 Well, that's why you can disable comments.
00:19:41 Just turn them off if you don't like them.
00:19:42 Yeah, but then when I'm a coward if I do that.
00:19:44 We all...
00:19:45 Well, why do you care how people perceive you in that way?
00:19:48 It's like...
00:19:49 But, Tom, that is the whole...
00:19:50 The point is not whether or not you can do it.
00:19:52 The nature of this debate is whether or not, like,
00:19:54 people should call you a coward for doing so.
00:19:57 That's, I think, the nature of this discussion.
00:19:59 It's not going to kill me if someone calls me a coward,
00:20:01 but I don't understand why they would want to.
00:20:03 My argument is, if that's the point,
00:20:06 if you have the ability to turn off comments
00:20:08 and you want to turn off comments,
00:20:10 but you're afraid of the backlash,
00:20:12 then you are a coward.
00:20:13 So, they're totally right in thinking of it.
00:20:15 I think I agree.
00:20:16 I think I agree with Tom here.
00:20:17 I think I got to chime in.
00:20:19 Yeah, but sometimes it's not really so much of,
00:20:21 I'm afraid of the backlash.
00:20:23 It's like, like you were saying,
00:20:26 you know, if the comments were gone,
00:20:29 people wouldn't, like,
00:20:30 maybe would not like your YouTube channel that much.
00:20:32 You wouldn't get as much traction.
00:20:34 You wouldn't grow as much.
00:20:35 Okay, then keep them on.
00:20:36 Then they're not good.
00:20:37 They're not good if they're helping you grow.
00:20:39 Then you need to just nut up, ignore the bad comments,
00:20:41 and let your channel grow.
00:20:43 I mean, how much they actually increase anything.
00:20:45 The way things are now,
00:20:47 like, comments are good for growth.
00:20:49 And, like, I don't know how they play into the algorithm.
00:20:52 I have some vague idea that, like, more comments
00:20:54 and more upvotes on comments
00:20:55 or something probably increases visibility
00:20:58 and feeds into the algorithm some way.
00:21:00 So, that's probably true.
00:21:02 But, like, then on top of that,
00:21:03 there's just the whole, like, people-like comments,
00:21:05 people-like the community aspect of it.
00:21:08 The community is fucking terrible.
00:21:10 Yeah, but I don't think it's fair.
00:21:12 It is entirely...
00:21:13 I'm trying to fucking say something.
00:21:15 Okay, say your thing.
00:21:16 I don't think it's fair that it's, like, across the board.
00:21:19 There's no good reason to turn off your comments.
00:21:21 And if you do, you're a coward.
00:21:22 Yeah, obviously, that attitude is shitty,
00:21:25 and it's not necessarily fair.
00:21:27 But, like, yeah, like Tom was saying,
00:21:30 you gotta just make a judgment call
00:21:32 of, like, are the comments worth it or not?
00:21:34 And, like, I don't think it's fair to be, like,
00:21:36 oh, well, comments are so bad,
00:21:39 but I'll lose out on the benefits by turning them off.
00:21:42 And that's not fair.
00:21:43 No, like, you can opt into that benefit.
00:21:45 You have to make your cost-benefit analysis
00:21:48 of whether comments work or not.
00:21:50 Yeah, they've got positives and they've got negatives.
00:21:52 And, yeah, I think it's kind of...
00:21:54 I'll just fucking say it.
00:21:55 I think it's kind of entitled for a creator
00:21:57 to come out and be like, oh, well, it's not fair.
00:22:00 It's not fair that there will be consequences
00:22:02 for turning off comments because you're benefiting from...
00:22:04 I agree.
00:22:05 Yeah, you're benefiting from...
00:22:06 You're gaining things from having comments on in the first place.
00:22:08 Like, you're opting into that system
00:22:10 because it has tangible benefits.
00:22:11 I'm not saying I shouldn't be.
00:22:13 I mean, fucking...
00:22:14 I know that, like, things have...
00:22:17 stuff has consequences.
00:22:18 Okay.
00:22:19 I just...
00:22:20 Wait, wait, wait.
00:22:21 I just am angry that comments always suck
00:22:23 and I don't like looking at them.
00:22:25 And there they are.
00:22:26 We should not...
00:22:27 I don't like it.
00:22:28 There's just nothing for them.
00:22:29 You're right.
00:22:30 There's just nothing for them.
00:22:31 We should not lose sight of the point of this whole discussion,
00:22:33 which was Digi propagating or pushing forward
00:22:35 a just a different website
00:22:37 that is just set up differently.
00:22:38 He's not saying change YouTube at all.
00:22:40 That's not his point.
00:22:41 It's that I wish there was a social media platform
00:22:44 that, you know, was...
00:22:45 Well, essentially, things like that already exist.
00:22:48 You can make a WordPress.
00:22:49 Like, I have a WordPress
00:22:50 and I put every video on Hippocrates on there
00:22:53 and there are no comments allowed.
00:22:55 Is it possible...
00:22:56 Is it possible Digi is just saying that
00:22:58 he wants all the benefits of YouTube
00:23:00 without the downsides?
00:23:02 Is that...
00:23:03 Is that what he's getting at?
00:23:04 Am I...
00:23:05 Am I turning against Digi right now?
00:23:06 It was a hypothetical, like, dream sequence
00:23:08 where he was just sort of like,
00:23:09 oh, wouldn't it be great?
00:23:10 But like you said, that does exist.
00:23:11 I mean, who wouldn't...
00:23:12 I agree, which is why it was so weird.
00:23:14 Yeah, okay.
00:23:15 Yeah, you're right.
00:23:16 Does the argument then turn into...
00:23:18 Theoretically, there's two websites.
00:23:20 They're exactly the same.
00:23:21 But one has comments, like,
00:23:23 you just can't do comments.
00:23:25 And the other one is, like,
00:23:26 comments are always on.
00:23:27 Does the argument then become what is better?
00:23:29 They're not exactly the same.
00:23:30 They're not exactly the same.
00:23:31 It's like the sharing is the same.
00:23:32 No, I know.
00:23:33 I'm the same for the sake of argument.
00:23:34 Like, are we going to go into, like,
00:23:35 the empirical value of comments
00:23:37 and whether or not, like, on, like,
00:23:39 an intellectual level are, like,
00:23:41 are they a just cause, like, inherently?
00:23:44 And to get into, like,
00:23:46 remove the option of them,
00:23:47 is that inherently bad?
00:23:48 I guess that's part of the discussion.
00:23:50 The thing was, like,
00:23:52 I never really think about this.
00:23:54 I don't think to myself,
00:23:55 ah man, comments in general suck.
00:23:57 I really wish I could turn them off
00:23:59 without any downside.
00:24:00 Like, I don't think about that.
00:24:01 This is just, like, a thing that has come up.
00:24:03 And I'm, like, just trying to, you know,
00:24:05 think of what my position is.
00:24:07 But ultimately, in this podcast,
00:24:09 I think what I would like to do
00:24:11 is just to explain to people
00:24:13 why you should not feel like you should have comments.
00:24:16 Like, why, like, the community,
00:24:18 like, all the pros that people bring forth
00:24:20 of why comments should stay.
00:24:22 I want to slap them down.
00:24:24 I want to push them into the ground,
00:24:26 into the mud.
00:24:27 And just watch them as they slowly writhe and shake
00:24:29 until they're completely...
00:24:31 You're taking the munchy road
00:24:33 of knocking people down.
00:24:34 I'm really proud.
00:24:35 Yeah.
00:24:36 That's a dangerous road to tread.
00:24:38 I feel a little bit differently about this.
00:24:40 I too have never closed comments.
00:24:42 I have banned very few people.
00:24:44 Mostly, like, obvious spammers,
00:24:45 or, like, pushing products or whatever.
00:24:47 I mean, I would happily ban any spammer
00:24:49 who's just like,
00:24:50 hey, buy my book.
00:24:51 I don't know, like, buy my...
00:24:52 Subscribe to my website, guys.
00:24:53 Let's, like, not relate to the content.
00:24:54 It's like, no, get fucked.
00:24:55 You delete yourself.
00:24:56 Um...
00:24:57 Yeah, so that's an instant ban.
00:24:59 I don't know.
00:25:00 Like, the whole, like, concept of, like,
00:25:02 hate speech and shit,
00:25:04 like, people, like, being taxed.
00:25:05 I don't know.
00:25:06 That's all vague.
00:25:07 I don't understand it.
00:25:08 I don't know how I feel about any of that,
00:25:09 so I just ignore it.
00:25:10 So, basically, I just opt out.
00:25:11 I pull, like, the PewDiePie and say,
00:25:13 I'll just let people comment,
00:25:14 and I'll just ignore it.
00:25:15 They can say whatever they want.
00:25:16 Uh, you know, it's not my problem.
00:25:18 I don't feel responsible for it.
00:25:20 Uh, that's their world down there.
00:25:22 I thought PewDiePie turned off comments,
00:25:24 or maybe he turned them back on.
00:25:25 He turned the back on.
00:25:26 He turned the back on a little while later.
00:25:28 Uh, but, like,
00:25:30 do I feel like I want them to be part
00:25:33 of the videos?
00:25:35 Like, I don't mind that comments are there right now.
00:25:37 I absolutely don't mind.
00:25:38 I'm happy to see them there.
00:25:39 It's fine.
00:25:40 But, like, I really think of my work as my own,
00:25:43 and I don't like the idea of anyone feeling entitled
00:25:46 to, like, be a part of it,
00:25:48 because what have they done to earn that?
00:25:50 Nothing.
00:25:51 I would say that if you don't want people to feel like that,
00:25:54 you just better not post on YouTube, you know?
00:25:57 Like, if there was...
00:25:59 Yeah, like, I wouldn't be against another platform
00:26:01 that didn't have comments.
00:26:02 I mean, I don't...
00:26:03 I mean, I'm totally on board with not liking comments
00:26:05 and not feeling that people are entitled to them.
00:26:07 Like, when I was making my website,
00:26:09 I had people tell me, like,
00:26:11 Ben, you gotta include a comment section in,
00:26:13 like, in the website, like, on the pages.
00:26:15 And I was like, no.
00:26:17 Because for a number of reasons, one,
00:26:19 yeah, I don't want someone to be able...
00:26:21 I don't want any chuckle-fuck to be able to go in there
00:26:23 and put their thoughts about my work right there
00:26:25 and attach it to the content
00:26:27 and have it be, like, a part of the reading experience.
00:26:29 I think it's... I think it's crass
00:26:31 and attention-seeking to put something like that there.
00:26:33 Like, hey, guys, tell me what you think about my thing.
00:26:36 Tell me right here so everyone can see.
00:26:38 Um, it's a... I think it's a bad look
00:26:40 because, like, Ben, like, even a popular comic
00:26:43 will often have, like, empty comments
00:26:45 on, like, you know, pages where not a lot happens.
00:26:47 And, like, that doesn't look good.
00:26:49 So, yeah.
00:26:50 Especially, like, to have one on every page,
00:26:52 that really interrupts the reading experience.
00:26:54 I see that on a lot of, like, Dojin websites and shit.
00:26:57 And, like, those are funny because I don't take those seriously.
00:26:59 But on a real comic, I totally would not want that.
00:27:01 Yeah, I don't, like, for a number of reasons,
00:27:03 I was like, I don't want people
00:27:05 to be able to say whatever they want here, so no.
00:27:08 Right.
00:27:09 No, thank you.
00:27:10 Um, I forget where I was going with that.
00:27:12 That's how I feel.
00:27:13 You know, I'm like a fucking, like, kiss anime and kiss cartoon.
00:27:16 Like, you can scroll down or, like, manga something or other.
00:27:19 Like, there's some manga and anime, like, illegal sites you could go to.
00:27:23 You can see the thing, and then if you scroll down,
00:27:25 there is a comment section.
00:27:26 And to see people, like, like, I know it's illegal,
00:27:29 but it's like, it feels like this is the thing.
00:27:32 This is the show.
00:27:33 Yeah.
00:27:34 You're watching it, and then there are people down there,
00:27:36 and it's like, this somehow reminds me of YouTube,
00:27:39 and therefore de-legitimizes the thing I just watched
00:27:42 as, like, a real thing.
00:27:44 Because now I'm thinking of it as nothing.
00:27:46 I can understand, like, the feel.
00:27:48 In an aesthetic way, I get it.
00:27:50 It's like a slight sort of, like, feeling.
00:27:52 Like, I just don't like seeing a big old comment section.
00:27:54 It sort of casualizes the experience, you know?
00:27:56 Even before I, if I don't, I don't need to, like,
00:27:58 read all of them to know that they were bad.
00:28:00 I just see the comments, and I'm like,
00:28:02 Oh, God.
00:28:03 Oh, good job.
00:28:04 I have never gone this argument that, like,
00:28:07 comments then become part of the video.
00:28:10 Because I have never, not once in my life,
00:28:12 thought of comments as part of the video.
00:28:15 Well, you gotta think about it in terms of, like, the worst thing.
00:28:17 I think they totally are.
00:28:18 They totally are.
00:28:19 You watch the video, yeah, you watch the video,
00:28:21 then you scroll down to see what people are saying about it,
00:28:23 and then you fucking internalize,
00:28:25 you internalize the general consensus.
00:28:27 Like, people are having the discussion right there,
00:28:30 and you're exposed to it.
00:28:31 I agree that, like, having the comments there,
00:28:33 just, like, like...
00:28:35 Yeah, it can really color how you feel about it,
00:28:37 because, like, immediately you get to see,
00:28:39 like, what the general opinion is.
00:28:40 And yeah, I think that it kind of robs you
00:28:43 of your ability to form your own opinion about something.
00:28:46 Whenever I will watch a video, I will just full screen it,
00:28:49 and then I will watch the entire video,
00:28:50 I'll come to my own conclusions,
00:28:51 and then, like, maybe one-third of the time
00:28:54 I'll go and see the comments.
00:28:55 Most of the time I will not even, like, look at the comments at all.
00:28:58 Well, that's...
00:28:59 They are not factoring my opinion whatsoever
00:29:01 of the comments at all.
00:29:02 If I find a video interesting at all,
00:29:04 I always want to check the comments
00:29:05 and see what people are saying about it.
00:29:07 Why would I care about what other people are saying about it?
00:29:08 Well, well, much, I mean, the point we're getting at
00:29:10 is, like, if it affects, like, a lot of people,
00:29:13 then it's relevant to our discussion here,
00:29:14 and, like, the rest of us agree
00:29:15 that the comments do change things.
00:29:17 So we just have to go with the consensus, I guess, on this.
00:29:20 And people can disagree, but I think it's,
00:29:22 I feel safe in saying that, like,
00:29:24 you can see, like, the view count,
00:29:25 and the likes and the dislikes,
00:29:27 and all those things weigh in
00:29:28 and change the experience a little bit, you know?
00:29:30 They're all relevant.
00:29:31 Like, if you see a video with, like, five views,
00:29:33 you're like, what the fuck?
00:29:34 There's, like, a physical, like, line.
00:29:36 Like, you have to scroll down to see the comments.
00:29:39 And that, in and of itself,
00:29:41 makes it not part of the content of the experience for me.
00:29:44 No.
00:29:45 One scroll is, like, not enough to separate it, I don't think.
00:29:49 And even then, even if the comments are gone,
00:29:52 the like bar is enough of, like, a damper.
00:29:56 You have to agree.
00:29:57 It changes my opinion.
00:29:59 That is a fundamentally different aesthetic.
00:30:01 To be viewing a YouTube video with, like,
00:30:03 comments just below the service,
00:30:04 you can see the like and the upvotes
00:30:06 and the downloads and the number of views,
00:30:08 as opposed to, like, watching a video in a fucking movie theater.
00:30:11 And then going to the goddamn ghostbusters, like, forums
00:30:14 to talk about the new ghostbusters for me.
00:30:16 Okay, sure.
00:30:17 The like bar and the contents of the comment section,
00:30:20 like, put the video in a context, you know?
00:30:23 That's right.
00:30:24 And a lot of the time, some videos are just, like,
00:30:26 not visually that interesting.
00:30:28 So you will scroll while listening to the video
00:30:30 to read comments while it's happening,
00:30:32 because there's nothing else to do.
00:30:34 If we're expanding comments to mean the like bar
00:30:36 and the view count, then, yeah.
00:30:38 Then those impact me a lot.
00:30:40 Then I'll agree that that makes an impact.
00:30:44 Like, if you click on just some random video,
00:30:46 like a podcast, and you see, like, a massive amount of dislikes,
00:30:49 and you're just, like, wait, I didn't,
00:30:51 what's wrong with the video?
00:30:52 I didn't see anything wrong.
00:30:53 Then you'll listen back and be like, oh, that's what it was.
00:30:56 Now I understand.
00:30:57 It's the smash cut to Nate watching a eugenics podcast
00:30:59 seeing the message.
00:31:00 Wait, wait, wait, what was wrong with this?
00:31:02 Why didn't they like this?
00:31:03 What was wrong with this video?
00:31:05 Everything checks out to me.
00:31:06 Yeah, yeah.
00:31:07 Okay, yeah.
00:31:08 I mean, I guess, I guess, I guess I'm the minority.
00:31:11 I thought I was going to speak for the unwashed masses,
00:31:14 but I guess I'm the native minority.
00:31:16 We're specifically talking about...
00:31:18 That's true.
00:31:19 We're just talking about if it's relevant,
00:31:20 if they sort of affect the experience.
00:31:22 Yes.
00:31:23 Which I think it's safe to say they do.
00:31:24 And I guess I don't think I don't think that at all.
00:31:28 But, you know...
00:31:29 Okay.
00:31:30 Well, considering that...
00:31:31 What we're explaining, saying, talking about is, like,
00:31:34 things added to the thing will affect,
00:31:37 and if the view count and the like bar is, like, does affect,
00:31:40 then it, you know...
00:31:41 I mean, it's so...
00:31:42 It's a moment specifically...
00:31:43 Assuming that the idea of something being close by...
00:31:46 Assuming that that is true, then I hate it with all my heart,
00:31:49 and it's the worst thing I could ever make.
00:31:51 I would agree that comments definitely affect the perception of a work.
00:31:54 Like, if you're watching a video
00:31:56 and you just have the video presented by itself,
00:31:58 then clearly that's one perspective.
00:32:00 But, like, if you're watching a video and then you scroll down
00:32:03 and immediately you see a comment contradicting things
00:32:05 or bringing up counterpoints,
00:32:07 then obviously, like, that's going to affect your perception of the work.
00:32:10 Now, one thing I will say about this is, like,
00:32:14 it's the same, basically, as, like, watching a movie
00:32:17 and then watching a review of a movie.
00:32:19 You beat me to it.
00:32:20 That's right.
00:32:21 It's the same sort of thing, except people in comments
00:32:24 are not the same, like, even a terrible review,
00:32:27 at least goes over the basics and has, like, visual aids.
00:32:30 A comment is just a guy going,
00:32:32 like, even the best of times,
00:32:34 it's a guy going, but, like, with a monocle.
00:32:36 Like, it's never actually as good as a review.
00:32:39 So, what Digi, I think, was saying is, like,
00:32:42 if you're going to make a critique of something in the comments section,
00:32:45 I would rather you make a more substantial...
00:32:48 I think that's a good point.
00:32:50 I think more people should be creators,
00:32:53 and if you want to bitch about something,
00:32:55 I think it would be more important to...
00:32:58 or better suited to making an actual product out of it.
00:33:01 I'll lay it out on the line, guys.
00:33:03 I'll lay out my secret ulterior motive.
00:33:06 One excellent reason why I didn't want a comment section on my website
00:33:11 is because I would much rather that conversation take place somewhere else
00:33:16 in, like, a public forum.
00:33:18 Or, like, on YouTube or something.
00:33:20 Perhaps a website specifically designed for that.
00:33:22 Perhaps patreon.com.
00:33:24 No, like, because if someone sees a comment section on there
00:33:27 and they're like, I have a strong opinion about what I've just read,
00:33:30 they'll go and just, like, fucking shit in my comment section
00:33:32 that doesn't exist to prevent this very thing.
00:33:34 But then, if they don't have that option,
00:33:36 then maybe instead they'll be like,
00:33:38 hey, something awful forums,
00:33:40 hey, 4chan, I just read this thing,
00:33:42 and it fucking sucked.
00:33:44 Well, that's exactly what...
00:33:46 That's exactly what kind of Digi was talking about, I think, in his thing,
00:33:49 which, uh, yeah, you know, which is good.
00:33:51 It forces people to up their game.
00:33:54 And I agree that people upping their game is good,
00:33:57 and I would like to see more of it.
00:33:59 Well, I guess that's all I have to say about that.
00:34:01 Fair enough.
00:34:03 That's what I want as a creator,
00:34:05 is for people to make, like, well thought out
00:34:07 and have a real conversation about what I'm doing, you know?
00:34:10 Right, which comments so often are not even close to that.
00:34:13 That is too shallow.
00:34:15 I'm actually pretty warm on comments in general.
00:34:17 Like, comments, like we've been saying,
00:34:19 are very much tied to the community aspects of YouTube,
00:34:22 which has both major pluses and minuses.
00:34:24 Uh, you know, people can feel more involved and engage in it,
00:34:27 but then it creates kind of circle jerky bullshit,
00:34:29 and like, drama is really popular, and all that gay shit.
00:34:32 But, like, for a show like Viagra that I do,
00:34:35 like, that is very much like a community engagement show.
00:34:38 So, like, to me, it seems like reasonable to have comments on that,
00:34:41 whereas, like, I don't know.
00:34:43 Like, something like my other...
00:34:45 Yeah, like, with one of those, like,
00:34:47 again, I don't really mind there being comments.
00:34:49 I don't really mind it at all.
00:34:51 But, like, that is, like, my...
00:34:53 It's like a movie that I made, and, like,
00:34:55 I don't necessarily think that your fucking worthless opinion
00:34:57 is relevant to this movie that I just made.
00:34:59 Uh, yeah, like, make a video response
00:35:01 if you loved it so much, or hated it, or whatever,
00:35:03 if you've got critiques or something.
00:35:05 You know what I mean?
00:35:07 Why don't just, like, disable comments for videos
00:35:09 you don't want to have that conversation on?
00:35:12 Yeah, like, there's some videos that, like,
00:35:14 like, is this video discussion worthy?
00:35:16 Does this deserve discussion?
00:35:18 Or is this just a game for two people?
00:35:20 And, like, we're talking about how there's a stigma to this,
00:35:22 but if more people did it, it would change...
00:35:24 you would affect the perception of the action.
00:35:26 Because, right now, the only people who disable comments
00:35:28 are people like Anita Sarkeesian,
00:35:30 who just get fucking trolled into oblivion,
00:35:32 and they don't want to hear it.
00:35:34 And it's, like, it is a way of just, like,
00:35:36 censoring and not having to see that stuff
00:35:38 or have it be a thing.
00:35:39 Some people have transcended it.
00:35:40 Like, TotalBiscuit doesn't, I think...
00:35:42 I mean, TotalBiscuit probably gets trolled for it to some degree,
00:35:44 but, hey man, no comment, so you can't see it there.
00:35:46 See, that's not being cowardly.
00:35:48 That's just saying, like, I don't want to hear it,
00:35:50 and I'm going to turn it off.
00:35:52 And if you want to do that, that's fine.
00:35:54 And, I don't know, I feel like the problem,
00:35:56 I think, for a lot of people who want to disable comments,
00:35:59 because that's not me, I'll keep them on no matter what.
00:36:01 I don't care.
00:36:02 But for people who want to not deal with it,
00:36:04 I think the problem is I don't want to hear opinions
00:36:07 or I don't want to hear these, like, dumbass comments,
00:36:10 but I also don't want to give up the endorphin rush
00:36:12 or whatever of people agreeing with me and sucking me off.
00:36:15 So it's like...
00:36:16 Well, we don't...
00:36:17 You gotta accept the good with the bad there.
00:36:19 It's like an all-in-all kind of approach.
00:36:21 I don't want to let the commenters off the hook,
00:36:23 because, I mean, we can talk about the community engagement
00:36:26 and all that, but we know that they love the power
00:36:29 of being right there.
00:36:30 They get to be right there up on the video.
00:36:33 And if they're good enough, oh, my shitpost,
00:36:35 my deconstruction in one elegant shitpost,
00:36:38 or this guy's a fucking cuck or whatever,
00:36:40 a thousand upvotes, yes, I have a tie to this man.
00:36:43 Okay, I totally agree, but don't you think
00:36:45 we have the exact same problem?
00:36:47 Like, that's why we're posting on YouTube,
00:36:49 but not like our own website,
00:36:50 because we want the power of having our voice being heard
00:36:52 and having an audience to project to,
00:36:54 and that's why we're all on YouTube.
00:36:55 Definitely, I just want to say,
00:36:56 and you're absolutely right,
00:36:57 it's just that I am superior to a commenter objectively.
00:37:00 I put thought into what I do, I work...
00:37:02 Even on my comments, you'll find more thought
00:37:04 than a 10,000 other comments put together.
00:37:07 Yeah, I mean, it really is like
00:37:09 we put more effort into making this podcast.
00:37:11 I mean, not much more effort than a comment, I guess,
00:37:13 because we're just speaking.
00:37:14 But, you know, someone has to edit it,
00:37:16 someone has to upload it.
00:37:17 It's a project, you know?
00:37:20 If more people turn their comments into videos,
00:37:23 I would care about them.
00:37:24 I would respect them more because they put more effort
00:37:27 into having a point.
00:37:28 Is that the real problem then?
00:37:29 Is it not so much commenter entitlement,
00:37:31 but commenter laziness?
00:37:33 Or, like, not wanting to...
00:37:35 I mean, the thing is that I've noticed
00:37:38 is that if you have, like, an other place,
00:37:40 like a Reddit, where you have designated four comments,
00:37:45 you say, go there to comment,
00:37:46 and even if you have a link in the description,
00:37:48 the vast majority of the people who don't go
00:37:50 are so lazy that their comments wouldn't...
00:37:53 You would never want to hear them anyway.
00:37:55 So, like, only the people who actually...
00:37:57 That's the thing.
00:37:58 ...gave even the tiniest bit of a shit to click somewhere
00:38:01 would, you know, I would respect them for doing even that.
00:38:04 So why don't more people disable comments
00:38:06 and do that then?
00:38:07 Because then they're fostering better.
00:38:09 It's the stigma.
00:38:10 Isn't that your problem, though?
00:38:12 Isn't that your problem?
00:38:13 Like, at some point, don't you have to, like,
00:38:15 say, you know, this is my responsibility
00:38:17 because it's my content,
00:38:18 and, like, I have to take the hit
00:38:20 in order to foster the discussion I want to see?
00:38:22 I agree.
00:38:23 That's why I didn't disable anything,
00:38:25 and I probably never will.
00:38:26 At the beginning, I said, like,
00:38:28 I can see it from both sides,
00:38:29 but my channel is kind of small,
00:38:31 so it's not even a problem for me.
00:38:33 So my stance is that when it does become a problem,
00:38:37 I will switch.
00:38:38 I just don't need to yet.
00:38:39 Yeah.
00:38:40 Yeah, like, that's the thing.
00:38:41 We should think of this from the perspective
00:38:42 of, like, a big YouTuber.
00:38:43 Why should a big YouTuber have to allow this
00:38:46 and be called, like, a piece of shit for disabling it?
00:38:48 Like, from the perspective of someone like a PewDiePie,
00:38:50 or, you know, whoever, like, a big YouTuber guy,
00:38:53 like, PewDiePie's comments were filled with garbage,
00:38:57 and people, like, shitposting,
00:38:59 and not even shitposting,
00:39:00 but, like, advertising themselves.
00:39:01 Like, I've seen his comment sections full of ads
00:39:04 because it gets so many fucking views,
00:39:05 and you can just go comment,
00:39:06 and you're likely to get more hits on your website,
00:39:08 probably, than, you know,
00:39:09 like, making a fucking video yourself.
00:39:11 So, like, there's an incentive to shit up his comments.
00:39:14 So, like, it totally makes sense
00:39:15 why he would turn them off.
00:39:16 I totally get it.
00:39:17 But then, you know, the backlash from people was so strong.
00:39:20 He's like, okay, geez, fine.
00:39:21 Like, that wasn't him being cowardly, I think.
00:39:23 That's him sort of just cow-towing to what the mob wants,
00:39:27 even though the mob is not making any kind of good points.
00:39:29 How is that not cowardly?
00:39:30 How is what you just said not cowardice personified?
00:39:34 Because it's not, I don't know.
00:39:36 Well, he's making a business decision.
00:39:37 He's accepting an annoyance.
00:39:39 It's not about being cowardly.
00:39:40 Yeah, I think the thing is,
00:39:43 changing your mind, I don't think, is cowardly.
00:39:47 It's just like, you know, if the comments are annoying,
00:39:50 you turn them off.
00:39:51 But if the backlash is more annoying,
00:39:53 then you turn them on.
00:39:54 Like, it doesn't...
00:39:55 It's just whatever you feel is, like, the least bad.
00:39:59 Because the...
00:40:00 My comment section has been more or less great,
00:40:04 and I don't intend to ever turn them off.
00:40:07 But the moment they stop being...
00:40:09 Like, the moment it goes from, like,
00:40:12 49% bad to, like, 51% bad,
00:40:16 then I will immediately turn them off.
00:40:17 And, you know, as soon as they become positive,
00:40:19 then I'll turn them back on.
00:40:20 It's not, like, a one-time decision that I will make.
00:40:23 It'll just be whatever my mood dictates.
00:40:25 Yes.
00:40:26 I just don't even know if people, after all this discussion,
00:40:28 will still get the fact that you do not have a fucking right
00:40:32 to comment.
00:40:33 You don't have the right.
00:40:35 People make that argument every time a discussion like this comes up.
00:40:38 You have no fucking right to a comment section.
00:40:41 You stupid, stupid people who make that argument.
00:40:43 They don't.
00:40:44 It's not a fucking First Amendment thing.
00:40:46 I know we've already established this.
00:40:48 It's just...
00:40:49 Understand this point, people.
00:40:51 Like, I don't deal with the riffraff and the scum of society
00:40:55 that have opinions like that.
00:40:57 So sometimes I forget that there are people out there
00:41:00 that do feel that way.
00:41:02 And every time I remember it, I get a little...
00:41:04 I get the howling phantods and I gotta go take a bath.
00:41:07 I will never turn off my comments.
00:41:10 I mean, probably.
00:41:11 I could at some point.
00:41:12 But it's looking like I probably will never, ever do it.
00:41:15 But still, to argue any differently on this point is absolutely absurd.
00:41:19 And it makes me mad just to think about it.
00:41:21 It's not a matter of like, do you like comments or not?
00:41:26 Do they have a right?
00:41:27 Of course not.
00:41:28 This is not a government issue.
00:41:30 This is not will you be thrown in jail if you make a comment.
00:41:33 As has been stated by us, numerous times before in our past
00:41:36 we are giving you a platform to do comments.
00:41:38 And if we don't want you to have it, then why should you have it?
00:41:41 Which we won't take it away, by the way.
00:41:43 But we could.
00:41:44 It's like that comic by Vincent standing around Magda
00:41:49 and he's like, dude, I could kill you right now.
00:41:52 Isn't that interesting?
00:41:54 What the fuck is wrong?
00:41:55 That's us.
00:41:56 That's us right now.
00:41:57 The guest mini-so that I like never fucking posted anywhere.
00:42:00 I should do something about that.
00:42:02 Thank you for reminding me.
00:42:04 You're welcome.
00:42:05 We could close comments at any time.
00:42:07 Isn't that interesting commenters?
00:42:09 Don't you find that fascinating?
00:42:10 I do.
00:42:11 My opinion.
00:42:12 Are the comments going to be closed on this?
00:42:14 No.
00:42:15 No.
00:42:16 I mean, I don't see the need to.
00:42:17 See, that's maybe inconsistent.
00:42:18 I don't see any need to, but you don't have a right to them.
00:42:21 Maybe we'll just for fun.
00:42:23 My opinion has never been...
00:42:25 I think I'll pin the worst comment I've ever seen.
00:42:27 I'll pin that one.
00:42:28 I never...
00:42:29 I don't want to get rid of comments.
00:42:31 I like the idea of comments.
00:42:33 I like the idea of fans or you know, trolls alike.
00:42:37 You know, to say what they want on, you know
00:42:40 on the things that I make.
00:42:42 My only problem is that there are bad comments.
00:42:45 Comments that are not thought out and lazy.
00:42:47 I want to make comments great again is my mission statement.
00:42:50 I don't want to get rid of comments or you know, remove it.
00:42:53 To be a charitable.
00:42:54 I want to just improve them, yes.
00:42:56 Right.
00:42:57 To be as charitable to like Digi's point of view as possible,
00:42:58 his whole idea is to improve the discussion across the board.
00:43:02 He clearly has, you know, the best intentions in mind
00:43:05 when he brings up this idea.
00:43:07 I, too, want to do what I can to improve the level of discourse.
00:43:11 So like, you know, if that actually would do so...
00:43:13 I think the main thing that has to happen for comments to be good
00:43:17 is for if somebody just like makes a silly, not very funny joke
00:43:23 and for plus ones, every time somebody pluses ones that comment
00:43:27 they get an electric shock and Google will determine
00:43:30 that it's not a very funny joke with it's like algorithm and shit.
00:43:33 So only really actually good comments will be at the top.
00:43:36 How do we define bad comments?
00:43:39 If only there were some sort of rules in place
00:43:42 that we could enforce with an iron fist.
00:43:45 Oh, oh yeah.
00:43:50 It's the fucking name of the thing.
00:43:52 We haven't even started talking about rules.
00:43:54 That's true.
00:43:55 We're in the weeds.
00:43:57 I mean, we got to define a bunch of parameters for you.
00:43:59 Can we just say that commenter upvotes and downvotes
00:44:03 are definitely fucking up comments
00:44:05 and that they probably shouldn't be a thing?
00:44:07 It gives the people the wrong incentives
00:44:09 to just be the least funny they could possibly be.
00:44:12 I don't think gamifying comments was a good call
00:44:15 because that becomes less about trying to just express something
00:44:19 and more like, I'm going to get the upvotes
00:44:21 because I don't have a YouTube channel
00:44:23 so my way of getting social recognition
00:44:25 is getting thumbs up on this platform.
00:44:27 The difficult thing is like, without upvotes
00:44:31 the comments are like, you know, newest first or whatever
00:44:34 because there's no top comment
00:44:36 or even worse, like the earliest first
00:44:39 which would mean the first comment is going to be first.
00:44:41 I don't think latest first would be that big of a deal.
00:44:43 I think that's fine.
00:44:44 Well, the only thing about it is that
00:44:46 people repost just to be like the top comment or something.
00:44:49 They'll just keep talking and posting to be at the top
00:44:52 because as soon as they do it, they'll be at the top
00:44:55 and it will make comments more...
00:44:58 That would take more effort on their part though.
00:45:00 No, what we can do, I've got the solution,
00:45:02 we display comments in alphabetical order.
00:45:04 That's the solution, that's how we do it.
00:45:06 Well then there would just be a load of A's before anything to say.
00:45:09 Exactly, and then it'll be A plus on every video.
00:45:12 And then every comment will just start with A-la-mow
00:45:15 and then it gets to the actual comment.
00:45:17 Perfect.
00:45:18 Incredible.
00:45:19 By the way, before...
00:45:21 Here, if you want to make a point, go ahead.
00:45:23 I was just thinking, like didn't you...
00:45:24 YouTube comments used to have like a character limit
00:45:26 and now they don't.
00:45:27 I'm just wondering.
00:45:28 I'm wondering if like it was like...
00:45:32 But I mean, the short, like you are,
00:45:35 like letter U, letter R, retarded.
00:45:38 You know, like that's short and sweet.
00:45:39 Character limits won't fix any of those kind of comments.
00:45:41 I would like more of those.
00:45:42 I don't want to be strung along
00:45:44 in like a very elaborate you are retarded.
00:45:46 I would like them to just be short and sweet.
00:45:49 Okay.
00:45:50 Well, you know what I wanted to say here.
00:45:52 I did want to speak on behalf of the commenters
00:45:55 in the context of this because like,
00:45:57 I really do get where they're coming from
00:45:59 because like I feel like I am in a risen commenter
00:46:02 over the years because my origins here
00:46:04 are from 4chan where I was a big shit poster
00:46:06 and a memester and whatnot
00:46:08 and I still am to this day and it's great and I love it.
00:46:11 So like, I get being a commenter on YouTube
00:46:14 and like wanting to like, like you were saying before,
00:46:16 your angle is you can try to make a comment
00:46:19 that's really good and people will like it
00:46:21 and I feel like that's like,
00:46:23 that's like the first job you can get
00:46:25 is like your starter job like,
00:46:26 oh, I'm going to work really hard on my comments
00:46:28 and make them good so everyone likes me.
00:46:29 And then if you find like, hey,
00:46:31 I'm getting good at like making things.
00:46:32 Maybe now I'll try making a video
00:46:34 and then you can like move up from there to making videos
00:46:36 and like in that way it could theoretically function
00:46:39 as like a stepping stone thing to getting you
00:46:41 to be like a more creative person or like, you know,
00:46:43 it's your way.
00:46:44 It like, it empowers the anonymous individual.
00:46:47 It gives them an ability to be recognized
00:46:49 for their, you know, a degree of contribution.
00:46:52 The problem is human nature does not actually reward
00:46:56 the most thoughtful, like valuable comment.
00:46:58 It rewards the most meme-y one
00:47:00 or the most insulting one or, you know,
00:47:03 anything of that nature.
00:47:04 That's the problem with the system
00:47:06 and because of that things don't work the way
00:47:09 we all wish they would with comments.
00:47:11 So that's just human nature.
00:47:14 That's just budding up against human nature.
00:47:16 We've got a steer human nature.
00:47:18 We can control it to a certain degree.
00:47:20 Like human nature is also to murder and rape
00:47:22 but we're working on that.
00:47:23 We're working on fixing those.
00:47:24 So we can work on this too.
00:47:26 We can work on self, Nate.
00:47:31 Would we like to start ironing out
00:47:33 the bullet point rules here?
00:47:35 I guess we should.
00:47:36 We've been doing this for a while now.
00:47:38 Before we get into the new, like the in you dash new rules,
00:47:43 let's just refresh ourselves
00:47:45 on some of the old ones I picked out
00:47:46 because I actually watched the, you know,
00:47:48 the old one in preparation for this.
00:47:50 Let's just go ahead and see if we have anything
00:47:52 to comment on or a change or redact here.
00:47:54 Number one, do not publish a comment
00:47:57 before finishing the fucking video.
00:47:59 Excellent rule.
00:48:00 Excellent. That is the golden rule.
00:48:01 If you've already done that, get killed.
00:48:03 Yeah.
00:48:04 Yeah.
00:48:05 Before we do this, would you like to start?
00:48:08 Would you make good on our promise
00:48:10 of banning people who do not abide by these?
00:48:12 Is that what we're going to do there?
00:48:13 I think we should.
00:48:14 I think we should for this video at least.
00:48:16 Who's going to turn to the time
00:48:17 to review all the fucking comments?
00:48:18 I'll do that.
00:48:19 I'll do that.
00:48:20 If you want to.
00:48:21 Hey man, go for it.
00:48:22 For our warning commenters, you're being warned.
00:48:24 You should have watched the whole video
00:48:25 so you heard this warning.
00:48:26 If you violate the rules,
00:48:27 you may be deleted from real life.
00:48:29 You may be completely obliterated.
00:48:32 I think it's time, you know, it's no secret
00:48:34 we've gotten some riff-raff with our ranks.
00:48:37 And frankly, I think it's time we start, you know,
00:48:39 weeding out the weak from the poor.
00:48:42 Because we love the poor so much.
00:48:44 We talked about closing comments.
00:48:46 We didn't talk too much about deleting comments.
00:48:48 But I guess that's just where the rules come in.
00:48:50 Deleting comments is there's no problem there
00:48:53 and it's good.
00:48:54 Yeah, it falls into the same jurisdiction
00:48:56 as just closing comments.
00:48:57 Like if it violates the principles, you know,
00:48:59 ethically, there's definitely nothing wrong with it.
00:49:02 And I don't know.
00:49:03 Yeah, it's kind of got the same stigma about it
00:49:05 that like it's cowardly,
00:49:06 oh, you're censoring criticism.
00:49:08 But like once again,
00:49:09 since I don't believe that commenters
00:49:11 have an inherent right to their comments,
00:49:14 I don't think that any individual
00:49:16 has a right to say their particular thing.
00:49:19 And yeah, like comments aren't sacred.
00:49:21 Comments aren't sacred.
00:49:22 This isn't, yeah.
00:49:23 That's definitely true.
00:49:24 You're not obligated to be like a free marketplace
00:49:28 of ideas in your comment section.
00:49:31 Very true.
00:49:32 But, okay, real situation here,
00:49:33 someone makes a very thoughtful, critical comment
00:49:36 of a video and the creator deletes it.
00:49:38 How do we feel about that?
00:49:40 It was a good comment.
00:49:41 But it was a post.
00:49:42 That doesn't matter.
00:49:43 That's still the video and creator thing?
00:49:46 I guess it'd be like how I feel about corporations
00:49:50 doing evil things.
00:49:52 So you're calling it evil?
00:49:54 Well, it's bad, it's ugly.
00:49:57 It's cowardly.
00:49:58 If someone makes a good point shutting you down
00:50:00 and you're like,
00:50:01 oh, I don't want to be publicly one-upped like this,
00:50:03 I'm going to delete it,
00:50:04 then yeah, you're kind of being a little bitch.
00:50:06 But again, it's still there in your comment section.
00:50:10 That's what I'm here with in your rights, but it sucks.
00:50:13 I would say the problem is that again,
00:50:15 that's why if you have a nuanced point to make,
00:50:18 you should make a video so the person you're critiquing
00:50:21 can't just delete it right off their content.
00:50:24 That's the comment you're being stupid.
00:50:27 But I think that the stigma is there for a reason
00:50:31 that are people who would delete comments
00:50:35 because they challenge them,
00:50:38 regardless of how well or how nicely you put it,
00:50:41 or how constructive it is.
00:50:42 Yeah, they should be struck with the task for doing that.
00:50:44 I think that there should be,
00:50:48 like, that guy's fucking,
00:50:50 it's just the generalization of it.
00:50:53 If a comment is gone,
00:50:54 that doesn't mean that the person who got rid of it is
00:50:57 running scared.
00:50:59 It's fair to call them what they are, though.
00:51:01 They're like, I mean, maybe not hiding scared,
00:51:04 but I don't think that's a respectable thing to do.
00:51:08 To be like, if someone makes a point,
00:51:10 it might just be that you just legitimately think
00:51:12 their point is stupid,
00:51:13 but this is where we hit a little bit of a gray area
00:51:15 because if I make a video, I make a point,
00:51:17 and someone, like my League of Legends video, whatever,
00:51:19 if someone makes a point that, like, no, you are,
00:51:21 let's just say they're totally polite,
00:51:23 but I think that every single point they make
00:51:25 in their comment is wrong, but they're polite about it.
00:51:27 If I delete that, I would say that's me,
00:51:30 even if I just think that I'm right and they're just wrong,
00:51:34 that's me, like, still not, like, really giving their ideas
00:51:37 a chance to be viewed by people,
00:51:39 and, like, obviously, I'm not breaking laws.
00:51:41 You can do that, but I don't like that.
00:51:43 I don't like that.
00:51:44 Like, I think you should delete comments that are,
00:51:46 one, like, they don't have a point.
00:51:48 They're just being stupid, like, just, I don't know.
00:51:52 Like, I'm trying to think of a specific example,
00:51:54 but, like, if somebody has a point
00:51:56 and you don't agree with it,
00:51:58 but, you know, I don't think you should delete it.
00:52:01 Relate to the tone of comments.
00:52:03 Unless you're deleting everything.
00:52:05 Relate to the tone of comments.
00:52:07 Nice criticism is not constructive criticism,
00:52:10 and, furthermore, more broadly speaking,
00:52:12 you don't have to be a nice person to be a good person.
00:52:15 You don't have to be, like, a nice, polite person
00:52:17 to have your argument and comment.
00:52:19 This is definitely a devout rule.
00:52:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:52:23 And very accurate.
00:52:24 Yeah, yeah.
00:52:25 Well, I'm just saying this was one of the rules.
00:52:27 I'm just saying that right now.
00:52:29 Oh, yeah, okay, okay.
00:52:31 I'm just saying, like, just because you, you know,
00:52:34 just because you're nice doesn't mean you're a good boy,
00:52:36 and, you know, vice versa.
00:52:38 Just because you're mean or rude or anything
00:52:40 doesn't mean you deserve to be obliterated from society.
00:52:42 That's a good reason, and because you are rude,
00:52:45 you probably are not doing good,
00:52:47 but, you know, it's not a rule here.
00:52:49 Just look at unlikely hero Ebenezer Screws
00:52:51 who has proved right to be a stingy old motherfucker
00:52:53 all along.
00:52:54 That was great. That was great.
00:52:56 I never forgot that.
00:52:57 Another one of these rules,
00:52:59 read the other comments before commenting.
00:53:01 So you don't say the same thing everyone else has already said.
00:53:04 Redundant comments are totally up for deletion.
00:53:06 If they're just redundant, why the fuck out there?
00:53:09 Those are out.
00:53:10 I don't think, like, sometimes there's too many comments
00:53:12 to read all of them, understood, understandable.
00:53:15 But you should scroll, like, a couple times to see
00:53:17 if, like, it hasn't been said recently, at least,
00:53:19 or if it's not a top, already a top comment.
00:53:21 Well, generally, this is, like, one of the most comment,
00:53:23 like, common comments things that, like,
00:53:25 this generally comes up for.
00:53:26 So, like, it should be obvious.
00:53:28 But, yeah, there's...
00:53:29 And you can just control F.
00:53:30 You can just control F here.
00:53:32 True. Like, get good, you know?
00:53:34 Yeah, yeah, great.
00:53:35 I'm getting quite a few comments on my League of Legends.
00:53:37 It's like, lol, this guy's just bad at lol.
00:53:39 And that's fine. That's fine.
00:53:40 But it is redundant.
00:53:41 It is redundant.
00:53:42 That's another...
00:53:43 See, that's not, like, a mean.
00:53:45 That's not, like, oh, I don't like you.
00:53:46 That's not why that comment's bad.
00:53:48 It's just because it's redundant.
00:53:49 It doesn't have any actual point there.
00:53:51 And it's a fucking lazy piece of shit.
00:53:53 I think the reason those comments are...
00:53:55 Like, the comments that I find most frustrating
00:53:59 aren't even the ones that are insulting.
00:54:01 It's because making a video is an act of communication.
00:54:05 So the most annoying things is when people misunderstand you.
00:54:08 Purposely or accidentally.
00:54:10 When they either...
00:54:11 Yes.
00:54:12 They don't understand what you're saying
00:54:13 and it's so obvious that they're wrong.
00:54:14 And it's just, like, that's the most frustrating part.
00:54:16 Oh, dude.
00:54:17 You will understand.
00:54:18 Okay, another...
00:54:19 Yeah.
00:54:20 That is a good rule.
00:54:21 Let's get into the new rules.
00:54:23 Wait, wait. Before you do.
00:54:24 Before you do.
00:54:25 About this, though.
00:54:26 Like, what...
00:54:27 Here's another real situation.
00:54:28 You wake a video.
00:54:29 Someone makes a comment, like, saying...
00:54:31 Like, no, I disagree.
00:54:32 But the way...
00:54:33 The thing they disagree with isn't your point.
00:54:35 But let's say that lots of people think
00:54:37 that you were making that point.
00:54:38 So it is, in fact, you who misrepresented yourself,
00:54:41 but their comment, like, misrepresented the point
00:54:43 you were trying to make,
00:54:44 does that make it viable for deletion?
00:54:47 Because you made the mistake, I guess.
00:54:49 I think I've been thinking about the deletion thing
00:54:51 since it came up.
00:54:52 And I think if...
00:54:53 Delete!
00:54:54 Delete!
00:54:55 Yeah, very good, very good.
00:54:57 I'm gonna delete that from the podcast.
00:54:59 Aww.
00:55:00 I think it should be like,
00:55:03 you don't want any comments or you allow them.
00:55:07 I don't...
00:55:08 I feel like deletion should be relegated to things
00:55:11 like spamming their own channel
00:55:14 or like a link to a bad thing.
00:55:18 Or like something that is actively would hurt
00:55:22 or damage other people in some physical way,
00:55:26 like a punch to the face.
00:55:28 Get rid of those comments.
00:55:30 What if it's a microaggression?
00:55:32 Microaggressions are basically real life violence.
00:55:34 I love micromachines.
00:55:36 I love Megatron.
00:55:39 By the way, before we get into the new rules,
00:55:41 just another old one just for...
00:55:44 New rules for new males like us.
00:55:46 Exactly.
00:55:47 There's a blast from the past here.
00:55:48 That's very relevant.
00:55:50 Ironic, me, me, cutesy, like,
00:55:53 oh, because this guy said not to comment this,
00:55:55 I'm going to comment this.
00:55:57 Try and get these to go.
00:55:58 Those are gone.
00:56:00 Those are gone.
00:56:01 Bye.
00:56:02 I'm sorry, but goodbye.
00:56:03 Delete those.
00:56:04 Yeah, those are awful.
00:56:05 We don't like them.
00:56:07 Stop, please.
00:56:08 Okay, okay.
00:56:09 Now we're getting into the new rules.
00:56:10 I really like understand, period.
00:56:13 Understand what...
00:56:14 Understand the video.
00:56:16 That is a great one.
00:56:17 I like that a lot.
00:56:18 That can apply in a lot of ways.
00:56:20 Yeah, exactly.
00:56:21 Like, if you don't understand,
00:56:24 or at least, like, like, you know,
00:56:26 there are good people who think they understand.
00:56:27 It's hard to know when you don't understand.
00:56:28 Yeah, exactly.
00:56:29 It's hard to know when you understand.
00:56:30 The way to understand is to get brain.
00:56:33 And to get brain, you need to think.
00:56:35 No, here's the real thing.
00:56:37 Being smart.
00:56:38 Here's like the actual thing you should do
00:56:40 if you're a commenter, okay?
00:56:42 If you're a commenter and you don't understand the video,
00:56:45 instead of leaving a comment with an assumption
00:56:47 of what you think it is
00:56:48 and making it idiot of yourself,
00:56:50 leave a comment saying,
00:56:51 I don't quite understand what you're trying to say.
00:56:54 Is it this?
00:56:55 Because by phrasing it that way,
00:56:57 that's a good comment.
00:56:58 It fosters a conversation.
00:56:59 And I'm much more likely to respond to you
00:57:01 to clarify my position.
00:57:02 If you're asking it as a question,
00:57:04 then making a declarative ignorant statement.
00:57:06 Now, asking questions is such a great thing to do
00:57:10 to get my attention.
00:57:11 Because I love explaining.
00:57:12 That's the reason I make reviews.
00:57:14 That's the whole reason I'm on here
00:57:16 fapping about my opinion.
00:57:17 Let me talk about my opinion more.
00:57:18 I would love to explain to you
00:57:19 the specifics of what I mean
00:57:21 if you have a question.
00:57:22 Now, I want to explain my point on understanding,
00:57:25 because this is a slippery slope,
00:57:27 but I think me and Ben are going to have a real talk here about this.
00:57:30 Like me saying,
00:57:32 I understand the video.
00:57:33 It is not your duty to understand the video.
00:57:37 If I have miscommunicated what I'm saying in the video,
00:57:40 then it is inherently my fault.
00:57:42 What I mean by understand to make a good comment
00:57:45 is that you just have to make an effort to,
00:57:47 and if you are intentionally trying to misinterpret
00:57:50 what I'm trying to say,
00:57:51 or misinterpret anything for your own benefit,
00:57:54 then that's what's not good here.
00:57:56 If you just don't understand, then again,
00:57:58 ask a question.
00:57:59 It is my fault that you don't understand
00:58:01 at the end of the day.
00:58:03 I agree with that,
00:58:04 and I think that makes the...
00:58:06 I know we're kind of joking,
00:58:08 but I don't think you can say you got to understand the video,
00:58:14 because if they don't understand, it's your fault.
00:58:17 You fucked up.
00:58:18 Well, right, but...
00:58:20 I think it depends on the terms of making an effort to understand.
00:58:23 I think if there's one or two outliers
00:58:25 who don't understand your point,
00:58:27 then you can probably be safe to say
00:58:29 that while it was your communication,
00:58:31 their misunderstanding,
00:58:32 it might be something on their part that they're missing,
00:58:34 but if the vast majority of people,
00:58:36 of your audience,
00:58:37 seems to be misinterpreting what you're saying,
00:58:39 then it's probably your fault
00:58:41 for not explaining it very well.
00:58:43 If you watch Mr. Betung's Mass Effect 3 review,
00:58:45 and your comment is,
00:58:46 Star Trek sucks.
00:58:47 You have missed the point.
00:58:49 At that point, it's like,
00:58:51 well, delete.
00:58:52 You're gone.
00:58:53 You're destroyed.
00:58:54 Yes.
00:58:55 Good.
00:58:56 You have to make an effort
00:58:58 to understand it on the level
00:59:00 that the original creator is trying to convey.
00:59:03 Also, if anyone ever comments that Star Trek sucks,
00:59:05 I will come to your house.
00:59:07 I'm not coming for you.
00:59:09 You will come for them,
00:59:10 and then ask them specifically which generation.
00:59:15 And no matter what, it's still a delete.
00:59:17 You just want to be clear.
00:59:18 Yeah.
00:59:19 I just need to fill in a little bit of paperwork
00:59:21 before another deletion.
00:59:22 Yeah, that's right.
00:59:23 That's right.
00:59:24 I have another rule.
00:59:25 Go ahead.
00:59:28 Don't take everything said so seriously.
00:59:34 I think there's an element of like,
00:59:37 it's hard to explain,
00:59:39 but you take someone seriously on the internet
00:59:42 in general,
00:59:44 and you're kind of doing it wrong.
00:59:46 But the points,
00:59:47 if somebody's saying something,
00:59:50 it's fair to say,
00:59:52 if they're just saying it normally in the speech,
00:59:54 normal speech,
00:59:55 it's fair to say that they mean what they say,
00:59:57 but you've got to try and think sometimes
01:00:01 that maybe they might be putting on a character
01:00:03 if you don't know what the character is.
01:00:05 I don't know.
01:00:06 I think I know what you mean,
01:00:07 and this is actually,
01:00:08 I wanted to make a similar rule to it,
01:00:10 so maybe we can combine ours a little bit.
01:00:12 And mine is like,
01:00:14 it's basically like,
01:00:16 give a reasonably charitable interpretation
01:00:20 of what the person is saying.
01:00:22 And so there's a lot of vague language there on purpose,
01:00:24 because what I'm trying to communicate
01:00:26 is that a lot of times,
01:00:28 things are said,
01:00:30 again, in joking ways.
01:00:32 I've made tons of jokes about,
01:00:34 I don't know,
01:00:35 how much I hate women or something in my videos,
01:00:37 and one could take that a certain way.
01:00:39 But friends of you will know those are no jokes.
01:00:42 Exactly,
01:00:43 and I would see each other once to realize
01:00:45 that I am not joking when I say these things.
01:00:48 But no,
01:00:49 I want people to understand,
01:00:51 someone could just cut that clip out
01:00:53 and say,
01:00:54 look at this clip,
01:00:55 this man is a misogynist,
01:00:56 he's the worst man in the world,
01:00:58 et cetera, et cetera.
01:01:00 That is being a bad viewer.
01:01:02 That is them nitpicking,
01:01:04 cherry picking is the word I'm looking for,
01:01:06 and they're not consuming it
01:01:08 within the full context.
01:01:09 So when I say a charitable reading
01:01:11 or a charitable interpretation,
01:01:13 it's considering the context.
01:01:14 I don't know, man.
01:01:15 What do you mean, Ben?
01:01:16 What do you mean?
01:01:17 I don't know if the viewer should be obligated
01:01:19 to have seen all your content
01:01:21 before forming an opinion about it.
01:01:23 I don't think it's unfair.
01:01:24 I think that's unfair
01:01:25 to the people making the content.
01:01:27 I think there is some degree.
01:01:28 Oh, that's not such bullshit.
01:01:29 You have to watch all their videos
01:01:31 and know their full context
01:01:32 before you can have a opinion about it.
01:01:33 No, that's why I'm saying a fair amount.
01:01:35 What you're saying,
01:01:36 I think we are,
01:01:38 maybe I'll allow me to try and clarify
01:01:41 if I'm totally off base, let me know.
01:01:43 But I think what you're saying is that
01:01:45 if you're a commenter,
01:01:47 and this isn't even just commenters,
01:01:48 this is like internet rules,
01:01:50 if you see something online
01:01:51 that gets your goat and pisses you off,
01:01:54 don't immediately have a knee-jerk reaction,
01:01:56 give them the benefit of the doubt,
01:01:58 and at least try and double check
01:02:00 and make sure what you're interpreting
01:02:02 is actually the proper context.
01:02:05 If it's not, you're making a big deal out of it.
01:02:07 I agree that good commenting
01:02:09 and good discussion,
01:02:10 yeah, you do need to,
01:02:12 you should at least have all the facts.
01:02:14 This rule comes with a mathematical formula
01:02:17 attached to it,
01:02:18 specifically for the calculation
01:02:19 of how to do this.
01:02:20 So this is a real rule you can apply.
01:02:22 And it's that a person's comment,
01:02:25 a person's comment is inversely proportional,
01:02:29 like credible or reliable,
01:02:32 inversely proportional to the amount
01:02:34 of content they've consumed.
01:02:36 So maybe I fucked that up.
01:02:37 What I'm trying to say is,
01:02:38 the more they know about the creator,
01:02:40 the more their comment should matter.
01:02:42 So like for example,
01:02:43 if like a crazy feminazi,
01:02:44 just as an example,
01:02:45 has never seen any of my shit
01:02:47 and sees me make a joke about women,
01:02:50 and then says like,
01:02:51 ah, I see this three-second clip,
01:02:53 I have decided this man is evil,
01:02:54 that person should be proportionately less valuable
01:02:58 of an opinion than someone who has consumed
01:03:00 all of my content.
01:03:01 I think you've got a bit of creator bias there,
01:03:04 because sure, that would make their comment,
01:03:06 like them having the context into you
01:03:08 would make the comment matter more to you,
01:03:09 but why should anyone else care?
01:03:11 Because that's how we arrive at truth
01:03:14 and the correct position.
01:03:15 I think from your perspective,
01:03:16 and I think what you're saying is like,
01:03:18 they definitely have a more nuanced understanding
01:03:20 of your character
01:03:21 and how you would phrase arguments,
01:03:23 but doesn't necessarily make it more valuable,
01:03:25 because someone can come in who's never...
01:03:26 That's some bullshit.
01:03:27 What are you talking about?
01:03:28 How can you say that?
01:03:29 Because someone can come in
01:03:30 and just watch one video,
01:03:31 comment on the topic of the video at hand
01:03:33 without going into like the best guy ever back catalog
01:03:36 and still have a relevant opinion.
01:03:38 But what can I do to solve this problem?
01:03:40 My catalog exists,
01:03:41 only they can make things more understood.
01:03:44 I have no power to further inform them
01:03:47 other than make the videos available,
01:03:48 which they are.
01:03:49 I think this is an inherent problem
01:03:51 with your chosen profession.
01:03:53 I don't think the commenters are at fault here.
01:03:56 I...
01:03:57 Okay, but that's why I'm talking about a...
01:04:00 not a solution,
01:04:01 but like this calculation of how much
01:04:03 someone's opinion should matter.
01:04:05 Okay, I admit...
01:04:06 I think saying opinion matters
01:04:08 is poisoning the well here,
01:04:10 because I was on board until you were saying that
01:04:12 the more people watch my stuff,
01:04:14 the more their comments matter.
01:04:15 I don't think that necessarily is the case.
01:04:17 But those people have the information.
01:04:19 Look, if you want to do like IQ test
01:04:21 to see the people with the highest IQ
01:04:22 who watch my comments,
01:04:23 I'm fine with that too.
01:04:24 But that's be practical, Tom, goddammit.
01:04:26 Come on, stop suggesting crazy things.
01:04:28 Yeah, I think my point was more about like,
01:04:31 like in general,
01:04:32 not to take everything you see at face value,
01:04:35 but I just had this thought a while ago
01:04:38 and I can't remember how I put it in words,
01:04:40 so it's kind of like muddled,
01:04:41 and I don't know whether it's actually
01:04:43 what you're saying, Nate.
01:04:44 Here's...
01:04:45 Okay, they could be slightly different.
01:04:46 Here's a broad criticism
01:04:48 of everything you've ever said, Nate,
01:04:50 in your entire life.
01:04:51 Sure.
01:04:52 I think, I mean,
01:04:53 you're putting your content out there.
01:04:54 You got to do that with the understanding
01:04:56 that it's there for the general audience
01:04:58 and the general audience consume,
01:05:00 is comprised of a broad spectrum of people,
01:05:03 some of which are real dum-dums,
01:05:05 some of which just don't care about
01:05:06 not acting like dum-dums,
01:05:08 and you just got to understand
01:05:11 you're going to get shit comments
01:05:13 and I don't see the point of complaining.
01:05:15 The way that I think about this...
01:05:16 Guys here, we just want to elevate the people who are dum.
01:05:19 It wouldn't...
01:05:20 They're not going to be elevated.
01:05:22 Those people aren't going to listen.
01:05:25 There's no point.
01:05:26 There's no point.
01:05:27 You just got to go with the flow.
01:05:29 You got to go into this being aware
01:05:32 and go with the flow on it.
01:05:34 I absolutely do.
01:05:35 I absolutely do.
01:05:36 Which is why, I don't know,
01:05:37 I feel like I could make...
01:05:39 To people who really know my content,
01:05:41 I could make all kinds of racial jokes
01:05:43 and be incredibly dark jokes and stuff,
01:05:46 but I choose not to do that kind of stuff
01:05:48 in my main videos for exactly this reason.
01:05:50 I don't expect everyone to have full context
01:05:52 all the time.
01:05:53 So yeah, I get it,
01:05:55 but I still think it is a purely reasonable thing
01:05:58 to suggest that just as we would treat
01:06:01 the opinion on, I don't know,
01:06:03 the rising ocean levels in the world,
01:06:07 we would trust an oceanographer
01:06:09 with his opinion on that more than a commenter,
01:06:12 like just a random man off the street
01:06:14 who runs a hot dog joint or whatever.
01:06:16 I respect the hot dog profession immensely,
01:06:19 but nonetheless, I think the oceanographers
01:06:21 were qualified.
01:06:22 I guess this commenter rule is white
01:06:24 until you think you know a bit more
01:06:26 about what you're saying.
01:06:28 I guess it goes back into understand.
01:06:30 Refer to my formula, everyone.
01:06:32 Refer to the formula.
01:06:33 When I say commenter rules,
01:06:36 and I say about banning commenters,
01:06:38 I want to clarify the fact that
01:06:40 that is all that I wish,
01:06:42 that they do not act like this in my vicinity.
01:06:45 I would never get Obama on the phone
01:06:49 and lock these people up for making a comment
01:06:51 that I don't approve of,
01:06:52 and there's no empirical objective law here
01:06:55 that they have broken and validated,
01:06:57 and therefore they are a bad person
01:06:58 who deserves to be ostracized for the rest of society,
01:07:01 for the rest of their fucking miserable lives.
01:07:03 They don't deserve to be ostracized,
01:07:04 but they do deserve to be Auschwitz-sized.
01:07:06 That's what I want for all of them.
01:07:08 All that I want here
01:07:10 is when I have the power,
01:07:13 which I do in this context,
01:07:15 I would like to use my power
01:07:18 in ways that I think is justified and good.
01:07:21 If I was CEO of YouTube,
01:07:26 I wouldn't ban someone for these reasons,
01:07:28 because the terms of service,
01:07:31 there's no law they're breaking here.
01:07:34 These are societal things
01:07:36 that I just wish that was upon the people.
01:07:39 And there are people who have turned it not dumb.
01:07:43 The old Fag PCP fans are incredible,
01:07:46 and they are great commenters
01:07:48 because they've listened to commenter rules.
01:07:50 Exactly what I'm talking about.
01:07:52 I've seen people become better commenters
01:07:54 because of that video,
01:07:56 and they take it to heart,
01:07:58 and so there's a real benefit to saying these things.
01:08:01 Maybe not to the swabs of the unwashed masses,
01:08:05 but if I could make one person think the way I do,
01:08:09 that's what I want to do in life.
01:08:11 I want people to be like me.
01:08:13 That's my goal here.
01:08:14 I want people to be like me.
01:08:16 If you're saying that my rule is too vague
01:08:18 and impractical and won't,
01:08:19 like, I don't know, you can't enforce it or whatever,
01:08:21 it doesn't make any sense, then so be it.
01:08:22 But God damn it, I'll continue to dream.
01:08:24 I'll continue.
01:08:25 I'll never stop.
01:08:26 Ben, no matter what you do to me,
01:08:28 no matter how mad you hurt my feelings.
01:08:29 I'll do whatever it takes.
01:08:31 Your feelings are grass and I'm the mower.
01:08:35 I thought you were going to say catano or something cool.
01:08:38 Don't have been sick, dude.
01:08:40 I do always agree that it is usually the creator's fault.
01:08:45 The commenters do deserve leeway,
01:08:48 and they deserve the benefit of that just as much as we do.
01:08:54 But I think there's a compromise here that can be obtained.
01:08:57 It would be better if commenters were smart for their own good
01:09:00 because they wouldn't be retarded anymore.
01:09:02 It brings me back to, like, if I made...
01:09:05 I talk all the time about how I want the betterment of humanity,
01:09:08 but if I just, like, made a joke one time about, like,
01:09:11 yeah, blah, blah, blah, I want to literally kill all humans.
01:09:13 And, like, just for whatever reason,
01:09:15 that clip gets shared around and they're like,
01:09:17 oh, look at, like, evil mass murderer,
01:09:19 you know, wannabe best guy ever.
01:09:21 And then, like, a news story sparks because of that.
01:09:24 Like, that would be people being ignorant of, like,
01:09:26 what I actually think.
01:09:27 And it reminds me of the PewDiePie thing.
01:09:29 That's, like, what happened to PewDiePie.
01:09:31 People who didn't know shit about the context of the guy,
01:09:33 just, like, taking his jokes at the context.
01:09:35 Well, that comes back to just taking...
01:09:37 to giving a generous interpretation
01:09:39 to the things you have no context of.
01:09:41 When is something inflammatory like that?
01:09:43 I guess I would just say that the rules for a good comment
01:09:45 are pretty similar to the rules for just being, like,
01:09:48 a worthwhile person in general.
01:09:50 Like, if you run your mouth about something
01:09:52 that you have no context of and no idea what you're talking about,
01:09:55 then, yeah, you look like an idiot and your comment is bad.
01:09:57 Like, if someone is, like,
01:10:00 Nate said that women are bad,
01:10:03 then it's, like, well, okay.
01:10:05 Which I do.
01:10:06 But he does it all the time and it's a joke.
01:10:08 I mean, if they had more context and they were, like,
01:10:10 well, I know that he's making all these jokes,
01:10:12 but, you know, I don't like that he makes these jokes
01:10:14 for these and these reasons, and they have, like, a well-formed...
01:10:16 Like, that's two different stories.
01:10:18 Absolutely.
01:10:19 So just know what you're talking about
01:10:21 in the YouTube comments section and in life.
01:10:23 Just the other day, I got a letter on one of my weaguas,
01:10:26 like, from a girl who's, like, uncomfortable
01:10:28 with my, like, jokes about Hillary and stuff.
01:10:30 And I just explain how, you know, like, I think it's all good fun.
01:10:32 I'm not trying to hurt anybody's feelings.
01:10:34 And I, like, I just gave, like, a thoughtful thing
01:10:36 and a lot of people commented and said, like,
01:10:38 dude, we really respect you for, you know, treating it this way
01:10:40 and not just, like, shitting on her.
01:10:42 And I respect her for, like, not just shitposting,
01:10:44 but, like, this is two people trying to understand each other better.
01:10:46 And that's what I like as opposed to shit-slinging,
01:10:48 you know, just by respect.
01:10:50 And that was a comment that was critical of your content.
01:10:53 And that didn't mean it was a bad comment.
01:10:55 Yep. Yeah, it was a great comment.
01:10:57 I think that's something that's so lost on internet discourse
01:11:00 that I really wish wasn't, is that instead of just
01:11:03 immediately going to, like, trying to meme it out
01:11:06 and, like, shit on people, just, like, have that dialogue,
01:11:09 because then you're nine times out of ten,
01:11:11 you're gonna come to an amicable understanding of some sort,
01:11:14 even if they're still disagreements,
01:11:16 like, well, at least I understand where they're coming from.
01:11:18 Just, like, imagine you met this person in real life.
01:11:20 You would never say these sorts of things to them.
01:11:22 And, like, you know, like, guys like, like,
01:11:24 like, Mumki, for example, it seems to me,
01:11:26 like, the difference between us who, like,
01:11:28 are talking about rules and stuff, we, like,
01:11:30 haven't given up on internet discourse,
01:11:32 whereas guys like him, and, like, a lot of people
01:11:34 on 4chan are like, they're like, it's all a joke, you know?
01:11:36 It doesn't matter. None of it's relevant.
01:11:38 It's all completely goofy. Whereas, I think, at least,
01:11:41 I feel, and I think this is shared, that we think we can,
01:11:43 we can rescue this. Like, there is good to be found here.
01:11:46 I don't think we can... Yeah, yeah.
01:11:49 There is good. I don't think we can rescue it.
01:11:52 But that doesn't mean that it's worthless.
01:11:55 Fair enough. Fair enough.
01:11:56 I think it can be improved.
01:11:58 I think you can cultivate a nice place
01:12:01 on your own channel, at least. Yeah, I suppose.
01:12:03 Yeah, I guess, I guess I've seen that.
01:12:05 I think for me, it's less about trying to, like,
01:12:07 change everything on a macro scale,
01:12:09 and just, like, choosing the kind of people
01:12:11 I want to interact with. Sure.
01:12:13 But, you know, every, every one of these small changes
01:12:15 affects the large degree, you know?
01:12:17 I totally believe in changing yourself to better the world.
01:12:19 I'm totally in that, and I feel that applies to you.
01:12:21 Like, just to speak in defense of Monkey,
01:12:23 like, I think that his, his, his ideas are fine too.
01:12:26 Like, his comments are like a shit show,
01:12:28 but there's kind of, like, some funny shit there as well.
01:12:31 Well, that's how he likes it, and that's totally fine, of course.
01:12:34 Yeah, and he's the creator, and he wants that to be the case.
01:12:37 So there's no, there's absolutely no problem there.
01:12:40 I, for one, would not like those comments to be
01:12:44 on the PCP channel anymore, but that doesn't mean they're,
01:12:47 you know, like, like, the reason those were made,
01:12:49 is because they thought those were good comments,
01:12:51 because, you know, that Monkey likes them.
01:12:53 So, you know, I don't think they were made in ill will.
01:12:57 You know, all, all of the, like, mean, like,
01:12:59 fuck you, Monkey comments, all those are made in good will,
01:13:02 because that's what he likes, and that's what he promotes.
01:13:05 It's, it's a good time, or, you know,
01:13:07 I don't want, I don't want to speak for him or anything, you know?
01:13:10 But that's why this place is transpiring here.
01:13:13 It's a difference of, of ideas about how to approach this,
01:13:16 this subject, which is totally fine.
01:13:18 You know, you know, these are just boxes of ideas.
01:13:20 Just don't, don't, don't limit yourself to just one.
01:13:22 You know, atheism, Christianity, new age beliefs,
01:13:25 you know, just pack them all together.
01:13:27 Pick and choose and build your own theism.
01:13:29 It's great.
01:13:30 Yeah!
01:13:31 It's like, it's like you're playing Minecraft,
01:13:32 and these are your materials.
01:13:33 You can just build yourself a house, build yourself whatever the fuck you want.
01:13:35 That's what, that's what it is.
01:13:36 Well, I only understand things in Minecraft terms.
01:13:38 I think we understand each other pretty well.
01:13:40 Um, if there's, I mean, I think,
01:13:42 I guess we could talk all day about this, but...
01:13:45 Well, I have one more rule.
01:13:46 I was going to suggest going on to questions,
01:13:48 but okay, I don't mean to...
01:13:49 I have one more rule.
01:13:50 And it's, it's kind of a short one because it's,
01:13:52 it's kind of funny and silly, but it's, um,
01:13:55 please swear more if you're going to be pretentious.
01:13:59 Um, one thing I hate, like, like,
01:14:02 you know how, you know, in the early days of the Internet,
01:14:05 it was all like fuck, and that was like a big deal.
01:14:08 Sure.
01:14:09 Like people would swear and they could do it now.
01:14:11 They could swear in front of people,
01:14:13 and they could say swears and their parents weren't seeing.
01:14:15 And like that was the thing.
01:14:17 And there was swears everywhere.
01:14:18 And then it was sort of like, oh, uh,
01:14:20 swears are for babies.
01:14:22 Like if you really want to get someone,
01:14:24 you have to be a pretentious, know-it-all idiot
01:14:26 who just types a lot of big words from the dictionary
01:14:29 in the thesaurus, and you look like a cunt,
01:14:32 and I don't like you.
01:14:33 You're just really annoying me.
01:14:34 Side note there.
01:14:35 But a well-placed, a well-placed, um, swear word is hilarious.
01:14:40 If you had your really pretentious, annoying comment,
01:14:43 you know, smarmingly like brushing everything I said aside,
01:14:47 and then at the end said, get fucked.
01:14:50 It would make it better for me to read,
01:14:52 and I would be like, yeah, alright.
01:14:54 You got me.
01:14:55 Side note from that, I love big words,
01:14:57 and I hate this vilification of big words.
01:15:00 I like reading old stuff because there's big old words.
01:15:02 What does that mean?
01:15:03 Big words are fun and funny,
01:15:06 but if you use them wrong, the consequences are dire.
01:15:09 So use big words, but only appropriately.
01:15:12 You have to really understand the words.
01:15:15 You have to read them and understand what the synonyms are,
01:15:18 and then just, you know, pick one of those.
01:15:20 It'll be great.
01:15:21 I have a rule that may just apply to me.
01:15:24 I don't know if anyone else will agree with this.
01:15:26 It's being edgy for the sake of being edgy.
01:15:28 And keep in mind, that does not mean don't be edgy.
01:15:32 I am edgy.
01:15:34 I like saying kill yourself.
01:15:37 That's real good.
01:15:38 I like that.
01:15:39 But I think that, at least from my perspective,
01:15:43 there's a couple times where I think I see comments
01:15:45 in my comment section, especially,
01:15:48 where people will just tack on edgy, kill yourself things.
01:15:52 I don't think that's the tone of what they're trying to say,
01:15:55 and they're just trying to say that to look cool or cute.
01:15:58 This is just like, guys, you don't have to be mean.
01:16:03 Be mean if you want to, but you don't have to be.
01:16:06 That's not the thing that you have to be.
01:16:08 I don't like you more because you say kill yourself
01:16:11 or you fucking hack or something.
01:16:13 Yeah, I know what you mean.
01:16:15 It's like a foe, you're swearing or you're being edgy
01:16:19 for the comedy, but it's not right.
01:16:24 Can we compare that to a rule along the lines of,
01:16:27 if you're an internet tough guy, you get an internet time out.
01:16:30 Something along those lines, you know?
01:16:33 I mean, you know.
01:16:35 I don't know how to enforce that, but we'll find a way.
01:16:37 We'll find less harsh rules because they wouldn't ban someone
01:16:40 for being like this.
01:16:42 All of these rules are just guidelines.
01:16:45 Oh shit, I forgot.
01:16:47 We didn't really define, we talked about deleting comments
01:16:51 and turning off comments.
01:16:53 We didn't really talk about banning people from comments,
01:16:55 which I guess is we could simply say,
01:16:57 if you violate enough rules, enough times, or enough egregious ways,
01:17:00 then you're just eligible to get banned.
01:17:02 That's a long time offender sort of thing.
01:17:05 If you show a lack of good faith
01:17:10 and an indefatigable propensity to see big words,
01:17:15 they're cool and I'm great, I'm the smartest.
01:17:18 If you show a strong proclivity towards just shit comments
01:17:22 and not knowing what you're talking about,
01:17:24 then I think you should be banned and there's nothing wrong with that.
01:17:26 Agreed, very much agreed.
01:17:28 And so just like, you can be nice.
01:17:32 You don't have to be mean guys.
01:17:35 You don't have to treat the internet
01:17:39 as a sewer for poo poo words, everybody.
01:17:42 It can be a nice place, you know?
01:17:44 It can be.
01:17:45 It's difficult to be the nice person saying,
01:17:48 I really like that video thumbs up.
01:17:50 That's hard to write because your mom will kiss you
01:17:54 and then you'll feel bad.
01:17:56 Yeah, exactly.
01:17:58 And I only have one last one.
01:18:01 I don't know if anyone else has a rule.
01:18:03 I've been carrying this.
01:18:05 Thank you, everyone.
01:18:07 This is specifically for me.
01:18:09 This rule is in relation to ones.
01:18:12 A very integral part of my...
01:18:15 The people have been craving this one.
01:18:17 Yeah, I have a very...
01:18:20 I'm very torn with this.
01:18:22 In and of myself.
01:18:24 Because on one hand,
01:18:26 I like scrolling down the Deagle Nation lecture
01:18:30 and just seeing thousands of people
01:18:32 with just a wall of ones.
01:18:35 Just like that's it.
01:18:37 Just a wall, a title wave of ones.
01:18:40 Well, you know, sometimes there will be videos
01:18:43 that I also want to see the discussion of Deagle Nation.
01:18:48 And that comment section is really a beautiful mesh.
01:18:51 Because here's, I think, how you do it the best way.
01:18:54 You press one for as long as you want to,
01:18:57 you hold that sucker down,
01:18:59 you do some ASCII.
01:19:01 You make a big one out of a lot of little ones
01:19:04 and you ask you out of ones.
01:19:06 All that sort of great stuff.
01:19:08 And then you just do comma or enter.
01:19:11 And then type your other comment there.
01:19:14 I don't want there to be ever...
01:19:17 A lot of people, our contemporaries,
01:19:20 would not like a lot of the ones there.
01:19:22 But I like the ones. I like it when you press one.
01:19:25 Also, please make another...
01:19:27 Don't make another comment.
01:19:29 Make just one comment, please.
01:19:31 Can we put down the language for this one
01:19:34 as something along the lines of,
01:19:36 when you press one, you may also comment after said one.
01:19:40 Something along those lines.
01:19:42 You may also press two.
01:19:44 If you're feeling saucy.
01:19:46 You just call the rule pressing one is only step one.
01:19:49 Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one.
01:19:51 I like that a lot.
01:19:53 That's an invitation to keep going.
01:19:55 That being said, a press one, everyone.
01:19:57 Indeed.
01:19:59 Take that first step.
01:20:01 I just have a rule just to sum up.
01:20:03 I don't know if this actually was in the first batch of rules,
01:20:06 but again, just want to reiterate.
01:20:08 The rule is this comment section is not your home.
01:20:11 You have no rights.
01:20:13 Your ability to comment is a privilege.
01:20:15 I just want to put that in stone.
01:20:17 That belongs on their side.
01:20:19 Indeed.
01:20:21 Well, sick.
01:20:23 Questions?
01:20:25 Let's skedaddle on over to the PCP Patreon Lounge.
01:20:30 This is all the people who aren't bad commenters.
01:20:33 These guys are good. They're real good.
01:20:35 They have given us money and gone into the exclusive PCP.
01:20:39 You know what?
01:20:41 Even if they were bad commenters,
01:20:43 they've purchased annulments via their Patreon Lounge.
01:20:45 I was just going to say that.
01:20:47 That's exactly right, guys.
01:20:49 We should add this as an incentive.
01:20:51 You get an immediate comment or violation annulment
01:20:54 by pledging to the PCP Patreon without a doubt.
01:20:56 That's official.
01:20:58 There you go. If you want to cleanse yourself.
01:21:00 If you ever leave, if you ever sin again,
01:21:02 you just need to up your pledge and it gets refreshed.
01:21:04 Just keep that in mind, everybody.
01:21:06 Before we get to the premium delicious,
01:21:10 decadent Patreon Lounge questions,
01:21:13 why don't you read the dirty, disgusting,
01:21:15 malaria riddled, yellow fever,
01:21:18 you know, jungle fever, a Twitter question.
01:21:22 Sounds good.
01:21:24 The token Twitter question.
01:21:26 It is the token one at this point.
01:21:28 Everybody, just so you know, this is at at TP Crasinators,
01:21:31 our Twitter accounts, every Saturday when we record these,
01:21:33 around four or five, we send out the full thing
01:21:36 with hashtag askPCP.
01:21:38 Just send questions using that hashtag and we'll read them.
01:21:40 Here we go.
01:21:42 Where did that go?
01:21:44 Here we go.
01:21:47 What are some good Patreons to donate to?
01:21:51 I can think of only one.
01:21:54 Only one.
01:21:56 My one.
01:21:58 Patreon.com slash save me.
01:22:01 Obviously, the question is all of us.
01:22:07 But you know, if you've got some money left over,
01:22:10 obviously donate your entire wallet to us.
01:22:13 But if you have some left over,
01:22:15 that for some reason you can't give to us,
01:22:17 what are some other creators we want to give to us?
01:22:19 That's the question.
01:22:21 I actually have a real answer for this.
01:22:23 There's one.
01:22:25 What's it called?
01:22:27 I actually have been a patron for a long time.
01:22:29 I'm pledging $1 a month to Japanese emoticons.me.
01:22:33 They make like $7 a month.
01:22:35 So I'm like a significant percentage of their...
01:22:38 Would you give them five bucks or something?
01:22:40 No, I give them one.
01:22:42 I give them $1.
01:22:44 Actually, I used to use Japanese emojis all the time.
01:22:49 I haven't in a while, and that's probably a big mistake.
01:22:52 I should definitely max revive those.
01:22:55 I don't know, it's just a site with a repository of great,
01:22:59 hilarious emojis, or emoticons, rather.
01:23:02 And I just like, wow, they make $7 a month for hosting all this stuff.
01:23:06 If notable homeless man Ben St. can give to a patron,
01:23:09 so can you, noble viewer, noble listener.
01:23:11 True, indeed.
01:23:13 I have a little YouTuber that I famously on my Twitter
01:23:19 have recently eaten top ramen while listening to,
01:23:23 called Brain For Breakfast,
01:23:25 who makes some real cool CGP grave videos,
01:23:28 but they're better, and I like them more.
01:23:30 So there you go.
01:23:31 He makes superior CGP grave videos with CGP gray in them,
01:23:34 but his are better, right?
01:23:36 Yeah, he makes geography shit.
01:23:40 So there you go, I like him.
01:23:42 He's making like $200 or something.
01:23:44 So like similar content to like the...
01:23:46 Brain For Breakfast, yeah.
01:23:48 Educational country things,
01:23:50 and he uses pulling ball because he's a hack and can't drive, yes.
01:23:53 I love pulling ball, excellent meme.
01:23:55 Yeah, he's a good guy.
01:23:57 Anyone else?
01:23:59 I would never give money to anyone, so no, not for me.
01:24:02 You can't forget about the classic Dr. Wolf.
01:24:05 Oh, no doubt.
01:24:08 That was a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
01:24:10 Do not even think about looking at that.
01:24:12 I patron, or I used to patron, hot diggity demon.
01:24:18 I feel like that is like a good investment
01:24:22 because those cartoons are like really good,
01:24:26 early animated.
01:24:27 I appreciate the work that goes into them a lot.
01:24:31 I've actually been, you know, there's this one creator I'm following.
01:24:37 Actually, it's these two brothers I've been following since like 2013
01:24:41 and they've really gone downhill and I haven't posted in a while.
01:24:44 But I'm just waiting for the day they come back.
01:24:46 It's called T... I forget the name of it.
01:24:49 It's something long, you know, T-B-something.
01:24:51 Anyway, go try and search them up.
01:24:53 They used to do pulling reviews and I'm a real big fan of them.
01:24:55 I've been patroning them for a real couple of long years now.
01:24:59 Now they're just hosting some shitty knockoff content
01:25:02 from the Rowdyfuckers cartoon.
01:25:03 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:25:04 I don't know what's up with that.
01:25:06 What a bunch of bullshit that is.
01:25:08 But frankly, it's disgusting.
01:25:09 You know what?
01:25:10 I realize, sometimes I am tempted to give to patrons.
01:25:13 The only people I respect on Patreon, the only people,
01:25:16 are the people who make gated content
01:25:18 because they're the only ones who ever tempt me
01:25:20 to actually pledge that I love you.
01:25:22 Like me.
01:25:23 Yeah, I have been tempted to pledge you so I can see those pages.
01:25:25 Like me and my speed draw videos
01:25:27 and my early pages and my beta testing period
01:25:30 for the game that's out now on stcomics.com.
01:25:33 I'm a proud patron of patreon.com.
01:25:37 You are.
01:25:38 It's very early on.
01:25:39 And I love you a lot.
01:25:40 And I would love you too, viewers.
01:25:43 Yeah, if you pledged.
01:25:45 Yeah, I made a deliberate...
01:25:47 Well, I went out of my way.
01:25:49 I wasn't making the speed draw videos, for example,
01:25:52 but I was like, I should really make some gated content.
01:25:55 Stuff that people that aren't interested
01:25:57 aren't going to be mad that they're not going to see,
01:25:59 but people that are interested will be like,
01:26:01 yes, I'm getting my money's worth.
01:26:02 I'm actually getting something for my pledge.
01:26:05 And that's been pretty sick.
01:26:07 I don't know if it works, but hopefully...
01:26:09 You hear viewers, if you donate to patreon.com.com.
01:26:13 been saying he will love you more than he loves Munchy.
01:26:16 Only if you donate more than Munchy.
01:26:19 Which is a lot.
01:26:20 I think Munchy's donating about $100.
01:26:23 That's the number to beat everyone.
01:26:25 Is it also incorrect to say that the Champion Chapter 1
01:26:27 will be fully out when people are hearing this podcast?
01:26:30 It was out as of last week when the...
01:26:33 Yes, correct.
01:26:34 Yes, so by the time this post, it will have been out for a week
01:26:37 over at stcomics.com.
01:26:39 There's your warning, folks.
01:26:41 Stay away from that website.
01:26:43 But I'll be starting Vapor's Chapter 3 soon,
01:26:45 and that will probably be Patreon exclusive until it's done,
01:26:48 so if you want to see that...
01:26:50 Is this the one about the girl?
01:26:52 It will be about the girl.
01:26:56 Every single time Patreon comes up,
01:26:58 I don't like the fact that my Patreon URL is my name,
01:27:02 so I never say it.
01:27:04 I really should change it to Hippocrite,
01:27:06 but I don't know if I can at this point.
01:27:08 I thought the point of that was that you didn't want
01:27:10 you to tie down to Hippocrite.
01:27:12 I know, and that's the thing, because it's like,
01:27:14 what else the fuck will I use it for?
01:27:16 Just do Hippocrite. I think that makes sense.
01:27:18 And then you can change it again if you need to.
01:27:20 It will be Patreon.com slash Hippocrite.
01:27:22 The same as everything else.
01:27:24 By the way, the reason I brought up Gated Content
01:27:26 is I do want to salute the
01:27:28 various porn Patreon people
01:27:30 who I check in on.
01:27:32 Yes, that's right, everybody.
01:27:34 This is one guy, Pinoy Toons.
01:27:36 Pinoy Toons. I like him a lot.
01:27:38 He makes very sexual drawings
01:27:40 that I very enjoy with my penis.
01:27:42 It's weird.
01:27:44 It's this weird brand of pornography.
01:27:46 The very sexy pornography.
01:27:48 I would not agree.
01:27:50 That's right.
01:27:52 Shout out to him for Gating Content
01:27:54 within the demo of his porn game.
01:27:56 That piece of shit with the free version.
01:27:58 In the middle of a fucking sex scene,
01:28:00 he put the second part of it behind a fucking gate.
01:28:04 I hated him so much, but I honestly
01:28:06 respect him for having that audacity
01:28:08 to just fuck me over like that.
01:28:10 Like a piece of shit.
01:28:12 If you ever want to know what makes
01:28:14 my stomach boil and my hair fall out
01:28:16 and my fucking body turn to dust.
01:28:18 It's looking at the Patreon
01:28:20 who's getting paid the most
01:28:22 and having all the porn people
01:28:24 and having all the actual people
01:28:26 with real intellectual content
01:28:28 making one-fourth of the stuff
01:28:30 that the fucking disgusting porn people are making.
01:28:32 When is our wonderful red-pilled warrior Patreon
01:28:34 overlords going to come down
01:28:36 on those filthy porn makers
01:28:38 like they promised they would in ages ago?
01:28:40 When is that going to happen?
01:28:42 Are they not doing porn anymore?
01:28:44 I'd say they were changing their policy at some point.
01:28:46 You can't do any live action porn
01:28:48 and any
01:28:50 risqué drawn porn
01:28:52 will get you shut the fuck down.
01:28:54 You can't make risqué drawings
01:28:56 on this website.
01:28:58 Are you implying that you can make non-risqué drawn porn?
01:29:00 I don't understand the distinction there.
01:29:02 The terms that they said
01:29:04 is anything that was like
01:29:06 rape or B.C. Alley
01:29:08 or anything like French shit.
01:29:10 You're not allowed to draw.
01:29:12 You can do that missionary shit
01:29:14 no problem and that's fine.
01:29:16 What the fuck is that bullshit?
01:29:18 That's the weirdest kind of context possible.
01:29:20 It is pretty stupid.
01:29:22 I just love vanilla.
01:29:24 I guess they just want to make vanilla porn.
01:29:26 Well, cool.
01:29:28 The absolute cowards.
01:29:30 Across the board demolish them is what I say.
01:29:32 Anything even the tiniest bit risqué.
01:29:34 Anything that can be confused for risqué.
01:29:36 If you want to know more
01:29:38 I made a great video on my channel
01:29:40 where I'm talking about this called
01:29:42 Jack vs. Jack in it.
01:29:44 It was great.
01:29:46 Oh, I watched that.
01:29:48 10 out of 10.
01:29:50 Excellent.
01:29:52 Here's something that we've discussed
01:29:54 among ourselves recently a lot.
01:29:56 Too much to a heated extent.
01:29:58 From Jackboy
01:30:00 in the patron lounge.
01:30:02 When do you guys think the PCPHQ will happen
01:30:04 and then no
01:30:06 proper grammar or syntax
01:30:08 after we're just I'm gay?
01:30:12 Well done.
01:30:14 I'm glad you're comfortable with that.
01:30:16 He's here and he's ready to stay.
01:30:18 I don't know, dude.
01:30:20 Maybe within the next year?
01:30:22 I mean, plans are...
01:30:24 Keep an eye out around May of next year.
01:30:26 I'm just going to level with you.
01:30:28 The more money you give us
01:30:30 the sooner it's going to happen.
01:30:32 You're not wrong. It's true.
01:30:34 That is true.
01:30:36 I don't know how much you open your wallet
01:30:38 is when this shit's going to go down.
01:30:40 It is a major operation
01:30:42 to readjust our entire lives
01:30:44 if we're going to make this happen.
01:30:46 It's a big thing. It's going to take a while.
01:30:48 People need to get established
01:30:50 and financial security has to happen for a lot of people.
01:30:52 It will happen piece by piece, I am sure,
01:30:54 when it finally does start to happen.
01:30:56 It won't be a sudden change.
01:30:58 If you want that insider info
01:31:00 really the key players
01:31:02 you have to look with your binoculars
01:31:04 to see and digi
01:31:06 and wherever they go
01:31:08 then that's where it's going to be.
01:31:10 They unfortunately decide
01:31:12 the fate of our lives.
01:31:14 Yeah. Well, I am 100%
01:31:16 committed. It is my goal in life
01:31:18 so we'll see and it's just a matter of
01:31:20 the financial things being where they need to be
01:31:22 so more money the faster it happens
01:31:24 legitimately. It's not a joke.
01:31:26 It is my goal in life.
01:31:28 Any more questions?
01:31:30 I'm scrolling through. These are pretty bad.
01:31:32 These are not very nice.
01:31:34 They're not very choice.
01:31:36 I can check out the
01:31:38 Twitter if we want to go...
01:31:40 No, no.
01:31:42 They got there. We threw them their bone.
01:31:44 It's kind of silly
01:31:46 how the people in the Patreon lounge
01:31:48 they just throw away that chance of getting the questions
01:31:50 to us.
01:31:52 I don't understand.
01:31:54 No, that's a terrible question. Never mind.
01:31:56 Wait, okay.
01:31:58 We've been going a while. I'm ready to call it.
01:32:00 Let's do one more here.
01:32:02 From the Twitter.
01:32:04 Here we go.
01:32:06 At L33CH
01:32:08 I think it's like Leech.
01:32:10 With numbers and shit.
01:32:12 At Leech asks, should we have a public execution
01:32:14 of all crippled people?
01:32:16 Specifically to you, Ben.
01:32:18 Great question.
01:32:20 Great question.
01:32:22 I'm leaning towards you.
01:32:24 And that's all for today.
01:32:26 No further comments.
01:32:28 Resounding yes. Goodbye.

01:32:44 I've said it before and I'll say it again.

01:33:18 Yeah, he's using them.
01:33:20 Is there anything else I'm missing?
01:33:22 We're on iTunes and Google Play.
01:33:24 I do it every week. It's a lot of effort.
01:33:26 Listen to it so it's not wasted.
01:33:28 Thank you very much, Tom.
01:33:30 All right. Thanks for listening, everybody.

01:33:46 I'm supposed
01:33:48 to be working
01:33:50 right now.
01:33:52 But I'm not working.
01:33:54 I'm doing nothing.
01:33:56 My dick, I'm jerking.
01:33:58 Myself, I'm sucking.
01:34:00 I am an asshole.
01:34:02 I am a stupid.
01:34:04 I've got a deadline.
01:34:06 Don't want to do it.
