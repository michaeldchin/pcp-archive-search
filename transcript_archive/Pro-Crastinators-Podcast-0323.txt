00:00:00 I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Cool.
00:00:13 Alright, let's just get right into it. Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:18 Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:20 I'm trying to be professional, and being professional is when you don't care about what you're doing.
00:00:26 So, whatever, I guess it's The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:30 I guess we're doing a show. I mean, I don't need it. I don't care.
00:00:34 I've really got better things to be doing, but I'm on The Pro Crastinators Podcast and Gibbontake and Oblivionfall as well.
00:00:43 Hi.
00:00:45 Hello.
00:00:47 I'm a little tipsy from earlier today.
00:00:51 Yeah, tell me about that.
00:00:54 Let's explore that.
00:00:57 Yeah.
00:01:00 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:01:02 So, it was a meetup of the Agoonary people, a few Agoonary people at the pub the day after we finished camp for the week, which is why I was not here last week.
00:01:14 It was an Agoonary camp.
00:01:16 Would you like to explain that for anyone who, would you like, let me see the Twitter, would you like to explain what the Agoonary is for anyone who might have forgotten?
00:01:25 The Agoonary is a scout camp for disabled children to go and have fun for a week with activities and scouty-ish things, but mostly just like low stakes fun activity stuff.
00:01:41 They sleep in patrol tents, they have a little patrol, and I go as a helper to help, and I apparently have been going for 11 years because I got a certificate this time.
00:01:51 Whoa.
00:01:53 Is it Boy Scouts related?
00:01:56 I mean, it's scout related.
00:01:59 It's like, it's actually, this year was the 75th anniversary of a Goonary.
00:02:05 So there was a big deal about, oh, 75 years ago the first Agoonary happened, and it was, you know, because the Scouting Association, initially it was Boy Scouts.
00:02:17 It was a guy, a British guy, who'd invented scouting by saying, I think young boys would like to do things.
00:02:25 I'm going to invent that, and he did that.
00:02:29 Because he was in the Army.
00:02:31 It's like, what if there was a low stakes like Army-esque thing for little boys to do so that they could feel like responsible and learn skills like tying a knot, making a campfire.
00:02:43 So he made that, and then the whole idea was to get to allow young people to have a sense of responsibility and autonomy and stuff.
00:02:54 So it expanded into Girl Scouts and all those other things, and then Agoonary was like, what about disabled kids?
00:03:01 Surely we can make something for them?
00:03:04 And so they did, and that's been going for 75 years, and it's great.
00:03:08 It's a lot of fun this year.
00:03:10 Had a good time.
00:03:12 Let me get that Twitter.
00:03:15 Yeah, show me the Twitter.
00:03:19 There's a site as well, I guess.
00:03:24 Yeah, goodery.org.
00:03:26 You may be able to see me in photographs.
00:03:28 Oh my God, how embarrassing.
00:03:30 That's so fun.
00:03:32 I may be doxing myself.
00:03:34 We're going to see you gooning.
00:03:36 You're gooning.
00:03:38 I'm going to goon.
00:03:40 Apparently a bad word or something, I heard, I think.
00:03:45 To who?
00:03:47 It's not like a slur.
00:03:49 I occasionally get tagged on Twitter by someone who's taken a picture of Phalia, my big booby succubus,
00:03:57 and they'll put text around her saying, are you a goon?
00:04:01 Are you going to goon?
00:04:02 Are you gooning right now?
00:04:03 Live a life of gooning, and I don't know what it means.
00:04:05 I'm scared.
00:04:07 The only goon I know is someone on Something Awful.
00:04:13 That's what the awful users call themselves.
00:04:17 Oh my God, give, I see you.
00:04:19 Oh no, where am I?
00:04:21 You're only five or six posts down.
00:04:25 I'm going to kill baking.
00:04:27 It was a Scottish day.
00:04:29 Yeah, we made kilts, and all the kids got to make their own kilts, and did Scottish things.
00:04:36 There was a cabot toss, and we had black pudding, and haggis, something or other.
00:04:42 Like haggis-esque meat.
00:04:45 I had a haggis once.
00:04:47 I've had a haggis many times. It's very nice.
00:04:50 I had haggis in like a...
00:04:53 Spicy minced meat, sort of.
00:04:57 Yeah, I had it in like a takeaway restaurant one time, and I ordered some over-the-counter
00:05:02 at like a haggis Taco Bell.
00:05:08 Damn.
00:05:10 Do you want to hear the origins of everyone's favorite transphobic slur?
00:05:18 I'm just realizing if people from a goonery find out that I am on a podcast, and the only things
00:05:24 the other two hosts have said so far is big boobies and transphobic slurs, I'm like, oh shit.
00:05:30 Maybe I shouldn't mix these cross these streams.
00:05:33 I don't know if it's technically a slur, but you know, that's where the word trune comes from.
00:05:38 It's from goons who were trans, you know, people on something awful.
00:05:42 So they just combined it.
00:05:44 Wait, really?
00:05:46 Yeah, it was a neutral term at one point.
00:05:49 So wait, what is a goon?
00:05:51 Someone on something awful.
00:05:54 Someone awful?
00:05:56 I don't know what the version of the word goon that I was referencing comes from, but it's probably also bad.
00:06:05 Yeah, I've never heard that before.
00:06:07 I'm gonna goon, like what the fuck does that mean?
00:06:10 I've never heard that.
00:06:12 I think I found some urban dictionary, but it's like it's stewing in the coom or something.
00:06:16 I don't know where the G comes from though.
00:06:18 Amazing.
00:06:20 I don't understand.
00:06:22 If you go to this Twitter, do not mention me at all.
00:06:25 Do not ever do that.
00:06:27 Don't let them know that this podcast exists.
00:06:31 I'm just saying, I saw some weird people using a similar word.
00:06:35 No, it's fine.
00:06:36 It's fine having like a podcast where we can say coom a lot.
00:06:39 But I don't mention, whenever people at that place, because they know me, they've known me for a while,
00:06:45 I talk about the things I do.
00:06:46 Oh, I'm making a comic.
00:06:48 I can show them my website.
00:06:49 Oh, I'm making a game.
00:06:50 Show them that.
00:06:52 You know, I'm doing this and that.
00:06:53 I never say my podcast ever.
00:06:55 Never would I ever subject them to knowing about the PCP.
00:06:59 This is a hard line.
00:07:01 That's fair.
00:07:02 That's a good line to never cross, I would think.
00:07:07 Yep.
00:07:09 Yeah, yeah.
00:07:11 I'm scrolling through more of the timeline here.
00:07:15 Yeah, this is a new thing.
00:07:17 Before the like social media, because a lot of the people who do...
00:07:21 Oh my...
00:07:22 ...Gunaria, huh?
00:07:24 I'm sorry.
00:07:25 This is not strictly relevant, but I just noticed the...
00:07:29 Damn.
00:07:31 I just noticed the frickin' minimalist modern reimagining of the Scouts logo.
00:07:40 The Flirterly.
00:07:42 Oh, the Flirterly.
00:07:43 They got that too.
00:07:45 They got the fuckin' Scouts too, with that fuckin' modern minimalist corporate bullshit.
00:07:50 Yeah.
00:07:51 It's...
00:07:52 I was looking at like the old programs.
00:07:54 I was looking at the old programs, because every year there's like a little booklet you receive in the mail.
00:07:58 It's like, okay, meet here at this time to get on the coach to go to camp.
00:08:02 And here's what the...
00:08:04 Like, yeah, there's meat here.
00:08:06 You want to come over?
00:08:08 And they have like the symbol of the Gunaria and the Scouts symbol,
00:08:14 and then usually the symbol of the school or whatever campsite we're at.
00:08:20 And the more recent ones have this like really minimal Flirterly, and it's like, okay.
00:08:26 I mean, whatever.
00:08:28 I don't care for it, but it's pretty...
00:08:31 I like the purple color, but yeah, it's whatever.
00:08:34 The Gunaria style is iconic, though.
00:08:36 You can't minimize that, because it's just lines.
00:08:40 Wait a minute.
00:08:41 Wait a minute.
00:08:42 You mean that logo?
00:08:43 Or you mean that on the bottom the...
00:08:45 On the bottom, the style is like a...
00:08:47 Fence thing?
00:08:48 It's a fence with like what's called a style,
00:08:52 which is like a smaller piece of wood meant to allow...
00:08:55 To help people climb over the fence if they're going on a walk,
00:08:59 but animals wouldn't know how to use it.
00:09:02 So it's sort of like symbolic.
00:09:04 It's like, yeah, we're helping people...
00:09:06 Helping them over there.
00:09:07 Over the fence.
00:09:09 Oh, I see.
00:09:11 Hmm.
00:09:12 Confusing a double meaning of the word style there.
00:09:16 But, uh...
00:09:19 I don't know where it comes from, etymologically,
00:09:23 but I think it's pretty stylish.
00:09:25 That sounds like something we should go down a whole rabbit hole
00:09:28 to discover.
00:09:29 Oh, hell yeah.
00:09:31 I'm doing it.
00:09:32 I need more rabbits down my hole, if you know what I'm saying.
00:09:36 Oh, yeah.
00:09:37 You can just shove them in there, one after the other.
00:09:40 That's a little abbreviated for one of my topics later.
00:09:45 I got a new pet rabbit, but I eat it with my butt hole.
00:09:49 You're closer than you think.
00:09:52 It's something I found, but I'll talk about it a bit later.
00:09:55 Okay.
00:09:57 Yeah, on dictionary.com.
00:10:01 I don't...
00:10:02 Oh, maybe it's not with a Y.
00:10:04 Maybe it's S-T-I-O.
00:10:06 That's what it is.
00:10:08 Wait a minute.
00:10:10 Yeah, yeah.
00:10:11 Old English device for climbing or ladder
00:10:14 to climb, Germanic steak to climb.
00:10:17 Yeah, so style with an I.
00:10:20 And that's where turnstile is from.
00:10:23 I get it.
00:10:25 Because it's similar, sort of.
00:10:27 Oh, and you know what?
00:10:28 Guess what?
00:10:29 Hey, this is exciting.
00:10:30 Well, the style as in form of appearance,
00:10:33 design or mode type, whatever,
00:10:36 is from the Latin stylus.
00:10:38 So, meaning a writing implement.
00:10:41 So, we've got one style from the Latin,
00:10:44 one style from the Germanic,
00:10:46 and I've been watching a ton of videos this week
00:10:50 from a channel called Tolkien Untangled,
00:10:53 going into, like, deep lore of, like, Tolkien stuff.
00:10:57 And so now I know that he would have preferred
00:11:00 the fence meaning because he preferred Germanic words.
00:11:05 He liked when English words had Germanic origins.
00:11:08 He didn't like when they had Latin origins.
00:11:10 He thought that was stupid.
00:11:13 Lol.
00:11:15 Yeah, and he was right.
00:11:17 Isn't it funny how styluses and tablets
00:11:20 were a thing back in ancient Rome?
00:11:23 Yeah, like ancient Greece or whatever.
00:11:25 Didn't we talk about this on a podcast?
00:11:27 I think we did talk about the wax tablet.
00:11:29 Yeah, the wax, yes, the wax tablet
00:11:31 that you could wipe but wipe down.
00:11:33 With the stylus, which is just a stick.
00:11:35 Yeah.
00:11:36 They were making it full circle.
00:11:38 They were so close to inventing the Game Boy DS back then.
00:11:42 They had one half of it,
00:11:44 but they didn't get the other half until thousands of years later.
00:11:47 Ugh.
00:11:49 Yeah, back then it was just called DS.
00:11:52 Yeah.
00:11:53 This is why they died.
00:11:55 They made a Nintendo DS,
00:11:58 but they were like, hmm, what do we put in...
00:12:01 Do we put, like, a screen and microchips in this?
00:12:03 Or we could just fill it with wax.
00:12:05 Okay, let's go with a cheaper alternative.
00:12:07 I think we'd be fine.
00:12:09 Ugh, the gals are mad.
00:12:11 Ugh, the Visigoths are angry.
00:12:14 We did that.
00:12:16 They wanted the new DS.
00:12:18 But if we spend all our freaking...
00:12:23 What kind of currency did they have in Rome?
00:12:26 Like, drachma? No.
00:12:28 Coins?
00:12:30 I'm actually kind of curious what the...
00:12:32 I think they definitely had coins in the printing mechanism.
00:12:35 They had coins, but...
00:12:37 Oh, the gold aureus.
00:12:40 Aureus.
00:12:42 Yeah, okay, aureus.
00:12:44 But if we spend all our aureus,
00:12:46 you know, putting microchips in this tablet,
00:12:49 then we won't have any aureus left to spend on the grain doll.
00:12:55 And then we're fucked.
00:12:58 With a grain doll as a cornerstone of modern civilization,
00:13:02 and that was there, as always.
00:13:05 Communism was their downfall, as with all great empires,
00:13:08 so we know better.
00:13:10 We know better this time.
00:13:12 Their downfall was letting gay people fuck.
00:13:14 That destroyed everything.
00:13:17 Romans, one gay person fucked, the empire fell the next day.
00:13:21 That's what I learned.
00:13:23 Because of the cum blast, it was too powerful.
00:13:25 It shattered all of the infrastructure.
00:13:28 It's like we learned in that movie, the butterfly effect.
00:13:31 You know, one gay couple having gay sex across the world in China
00:13:36 can have ripple effects that spread throughout the entire world
00:13:39 and cause a tornado in California.
00:13:42 It's just...
00:13:44 It's just true.
00:13:46 It's just the facts.
00:13:48 I was imagining, like, ancient Rome,
00:13:52 like, oh, I'm an artist.
00:13:54 I have my Cintiq wax tablet
00:13:56 propped up on his stone marble desk.
00:14:00 He's like, ah, yes.
00:14:02 Drawing a thing.
00:14:04 You finished, and it's like, oh, well,
00:14:06 I don't know what to do now.
00:14:09 New tablet.
00:14:11 Oh, my God, I just...
00:14:13 I just learned.
00:14:15 I literally just learned what Orish Alchem,
00:14:18 or Orahalchim, is.
00:14:20 Or a calcum.
00:14:22 Yeah, because I guess they made...
00:14:24 I guess they made Roman orias out of it sometimes.
00:14:29 And I guess it's just some bullshit.
00:14:32 In numismatics,
00:14:35 which I guess is the study or collection of currency,
00:14:39 the term Orahalchim is used to refer to the golden-colored bronze alloy
00:14:44 used for the Cistercius and Dupondius coins.
00:14:49 It is considered more valuable than copper,
00:14:51 of which the az coin...
00:14:54 Az coin.
00:14:56 The az coin was made, which was a bronze...
00:14:59 They had fucking...
00:15:01 They had too many coins.
00:15:03 They're doing a stupid Harry Potter, like,
00:15:05 uh, bronze nuts and silver sickles and whatever.
00:15:08 There's too many. Just keep it simple, stupid.
00:15:11 I don't need all this garbage.
00:15:14 So wait, is Orahalchim like a mineral,
00:15:17 or is it just like a different percentage of something alloy?
00:15:22 It says it's just an alloy,
00:15:25 but it's a type of bronze,
00:15:28 and it says it's golden-colored and it's a type of bronze,
00:15:31 but it doesn't go into any more detail than that.
00:15:34 Well, that's stupid.
00:15:36 Those Romans should have wrote it down.
00:15:39 Yeah, yeah.
00:15:41 I guess we'll never know.
00:15:44 There's no way to determine these things.
00:15:48 Uh...
00:15:52 Man, so...
00:15:54 Yeah, I've been watching a lot of those Tolkien videos.
00:15:57 They're pretty good.
00:15:59 I've also, last week,
00:16:01 Simsie mentioned a channel called Explore With Us,
00:16:04 which is sort of, it's basically the same as Jim Can't Swim,
00:16:08 and I watched a bunch of those.
00:16:12 Those were wild.
00:16:15 You know the kind of videos I'm talking about, right?
00:16:18 Remind me, Jim Can't Swim.
00:16:20 I don't know if I've seen any of those.
00:16:22 It's like the Death Pig,
00:16:26 where they're interrogating Ben St.
00:16:29 It's like that.
00:16:31 It's exactly like that.
00:16:33 No, it's police interrogation videos,
00:16:37 but they're paused and then...
00:16:40 Yeah, this is why this guy's fucked right now,
00:16:43 because he just lied on camera.
00:16:46 Well, all the ones that I've seen
00:16:49 have less been about...
00:16:51 They've less been focused on,
00:16:53 here's how we know he's lying,
00:16:55 and more about this person is mentally ill.
00:16:58 It's not so much about...
00:17:01 I mean, there is some of that.
00:17:03 It's like, yeah, what their body language is saying,
00:17:06 but a lot of the ones that I watched
00:17:08 have had mentally ill people or autistic people or something.
00:17:11 Yeah, so it was like a guy who just admitted to the murder,
00:17:15 and they could determine from the way he was just saying everything,
00:17:19 and it was all factually accurate that he was insane.
00:17:22 Yeah, the big guy with the long hair, right?
00:17:25 Yeah, yeah.
00:17:27 I saw that one.
00:17:29 Yeah, that's the Jim Can't Swim.
00:17:31 These...
00:17:33 Some of the Explorer with us...
00:17:38 Oh, they have the interviews with the freaking Slenderman killer girls,
00:17:44 the ones that stabbed their friend.
00:17:46 That's fucking...
00:17:48 Oh, I've heard of that one.
00:17:50 Don't take this the wrong way,
00:17:53 but they're adorable.
00:17:55 I love them.
00:17:58 They killed their friend?
00:18:00 First of all, she didn't die. Let's not be hysterical.
00:18:03 I don't know the thing.
00:18:05 I just heard that they stabbed someone because of Slenderman.
00:18:09 Yeah.
00:18:11 Yeah, basically.
00:18:13 They thought they could become his proxies or his puppets
00:18:16 or something and live in Slenderman.
00:18:18 They wanted to prove themselves to him, so they went into the woods
00:18:21 and they did some fucked up shit and they waited.
00:18:24 Yeah, well, I've learned some things about it.
00:18:26 It was not really in the woods.
00:18:28 It was more in like a small little cops of trees in like a park.
00:18:33 But they both...
00:18:35 Oh, my God.
00:18:37 I was like...
00:18:38 I had watched a bunch and then like before bed,
00:18:41 last night I started that one up and I was so engrossed in it
00:18:45 that I stayed up way too late.
00:18:47 I watched all three hours of it.
00:18:49 I could not stop watching it.
00:18:51 They loved it.
00:18:53 They both...
00:18:55 It's these two girls.
00:18:57 One of them is schizophrenic
00:19:00 and I think bipolar
00:19:03 and the other one...
00:19:05 I'm not sure if she was diagnosed with anything,
00:19:07 but she was definitely not normal.
00:19:09 And they both basically seemed to think
00:19:14 that the other one was the one that really believed it
00:19:17 and they were kind of like...
00:19:19 No, that's not true.
00:19:20 No, no.
00:19:21 No, that's not true.
00:19:22 Well, they both think the other one was the one telling them
00:19:25 they had to do it.
00:19:26 Like neither one of them knows why they had to do it.
00:19:28 They both think that the other one was like,
00:19:30 it just has to be this way.
00:19:32 It just has to be this way and I don't know why
00:19:34 and I can't explain it,
00:19:35 but we have to do it or we're going to die.
00:19:37 Slender Man's going to kill our families if we don't do it.
00:19:39 Oh, no.
00:19:40 Yeah, yeah.
00:19:45 Man, what else?
00:19:47 I could say a lot about that one.
00:19:48 The worst one, though...
00:19:50 The worst one and this was so infuriating
00:19:52 was there was a guy...
00:19:54 It starts off, it's like...
00:19:56 This is a very unusual interview.
00:19:59 I'm not going to tell...
00:20:01 I'm not the narrator.
00:20:02 I'm not going to explain what is going on here.
00:20:04 Watch this interview and try to figure out
00:20:07 what's going on.
00:20:09 They sit this guy down.
00:20:11 He's got bruises all over his face.
00:20:12 They sit him down
00:20:13 and they found his girlfriend dead
00:20:15 in his house and he was in the house
00:20:17 and the guy seems confused and he's out of it
00:20:19 and he's answering questions
00:20:20 like only semi-coherently.
00:20:21 They're trying to ask him what happened
00:20:23 and he's just like,
00:20:24 I don't know, man.
00:20:25 I just want to go to sleep.
00:20:27 Five minutes and I'm like,
00:20:29 he's obviously got a head injury.
00:20:31 He's obviously got a head injury
00:20:33 and he's disoriented and he's not.
00:20:35 That's why he's answering all these questions weird.
00:20:37 He's got a head injury.
00:20:38 So the interview goes on for like an hour
00:20:41 and turns out at the end,
00:20:44 he's like, did you figure it out?
00:20:45 If you look closely,
00:20:46 you could see that he had a head injury.
00:20:48 Yes, that's it.
00:20:49 He'd been shot through the head.
00:20:51 The guy had shot him through the eye twice
00:20:54 and four bullet holes,
00:20:56 four open bullet wounds were in his head
00:21:02 and they just didn't notice.
00:21:04 He noticed?
00:21:06 The cops simply, they held him in the car
00:21:09 and then they took him to the interrogation room
00:21:11 and they interrogated him for six hours
00:21:14 because they didn't notice
00:21:16 obvious, visible, open bullet wounds
00:21:19 in his head.
00:21:23 Yeah, it sucked so bad.
00:21:25 Was there a blood coming out?
00:21:27 He had blood on him.
00:21:29 He had bruised.
00:21:30 He was bruised severely in the face.
00:21:36 I'm assuming he somehow survived
00:21:38 because if his six hours being conscious
00:21:41 with that,
00:21:43 I've heard of people getting shot
00:21:45 or a steam engine guy
00:21:47 got a train explosion
00:21:50 and he'd bar through the head
00:21:52 and his brain was cut
00:21:53 but he was like,
00:21:54 oh yeah, I'm fine.
00:21:55 Yeah, it was basically like that.
00:21:57 He was...
00:21:59 Okay, he had apparently been
00:22:01 in his house for two days
00:22:04 or something before the cops found him
00:22:07 so he'd already been just walking around
00:22:09 not knowing what was going on
00:22:11 with, yeah, he'd been shot through the head.
00:22:13 Then the cops find him.
00:22:15 They don't recognize that this guy
00:22:17 obviously needs to go to the hospital
00:22:19 not now but a long time ago really
00:22:23 and they just don't...
00:22:25 It was so obvious.
00:22:27 Instantly, he's obviously suffering a head injury
00:22:29 and of course, that's what was going on.
00:22:31 Yeah, so they waste six hours
00:22:33 during which he desperately needed
00:22:35 medical treatment.
00:22:36 They eventually figure it out
00:22:38 and get him to the hospital
00:22:40 and they get him surgery and stuff.
00:22:42 They try to put his head back together.
00:22:44 They have to remove part of his brain.
00:22:47 He does survive but he's never the same.
00:22:51 He has terrible seizures
00:22:53 for the rest of his life
00:22:54 and a couple years later, he does die.
00:22:57 Oh, that's so freaky.
00:22:59 I don't like thinking about that.
00:23:01 No.
00:23:02 Wow.
00:23:03 The guy's talking to him
00:23:04 and he's asking him,
00:23:05 do you remember what happened?
00:23:07 At first, he says,
00:23:09 yeah, we had bows and arrows.
00:23:11 We had bows and arrows
00:23:12 and he's like, what?
00:23:14 And then he explains what he means by the bow and arrow
00:23:16 and he's like, you mean revolvers?
00:23:18 You mean a gun?
00:23:19 He's like, yeah, revolvers.
00:23:20 That's what I said, revolvers.
00:23:24 The neurons are firing into the open air.
00:23:26 They're just falling out of them.
00:23:30 He keeps changing the story.
00:23:32 First, he talks about the girlfriend.
00:23:34 He says she's someone else's girlfriend.
00:23:35 Then she says he's his
00:23:36 and then there's another girl
00:23:37 and then there's another guy.
00:23:39 And then at one point,
00:23:40 just totally randomly,
00:23:41 he's like, oh, yeah,
00:23:43 so-and-so and his dad, yeah,
00:23:45 they broke into our house
00:23:46 and they shot us.
00:23:47 But I got to go.
00:23:48 I just want to go home and go to sleep.
00:23:50 And he's like, what?
00:23:51 They shot you?
00:23:52 He's like, yeah, where did they shoot you?
00:23:53 They shot me in the eye.
00:23:54 And the cop is like...
00:23:56 The fact that he knew
00:23:58 that that's where he was shot,
00:24:00 but he just didn't do anything about it
00:24:02 because he got shot in the brain.
00:24:04 He just thought,
00:24:06 you'd be dead if you got shot in the eye.
00:24:08 So obviously, that's not what happened.
00:24:10 But it is what happened.
00:24:12 It takes him a while for the guy to say it, though,
00:24:14 because he's having trouble remembering stuff.
00:24:17 I'm just f-f-fuck off.
00:24:20 This is made me really mad.
00:24:22 Apparently, and I didn't see this,
00:24:24 but apparently they took photos.
00:24:26 When they brought him in for questioning,
00:24:28 they took photos of him.
00:24:29 And apparently you can see
00:24:30 the open head wounds in the photos.
00:24:33 I guess they just didn't look at them.
00:24:36 We'll need that later.
00:24:39 Oh, man.
00:24:41 That one was f-f-ing infuriating.
00:24:44 I'm trying to...
00:24:46 I don't want to watch that.
00:24:47 I don't want to know about that.
00:24:48 That one's really troubling.
00:24:50 That one made me sick.
00:24:52 Yeah, I'm feeling a little woozy.
00:24:55 Yeah.
00:24:57 The Slenderman, though,
00:25:00 loved it.
00:25:01 I mean, I know they did a crime.
00:25:02 It's really horrible what they did to their friends.
00:25:05 But they both just seem...
00:25:10 They're both being melodramatic about it.
00:25:13 They're both...
00:25:16 The schizophrenic one keeps being like...
00:25:20 She keeps being like,
00:25:21 it was just necessary.
00:25:23 It just had to happen.
00:25:27 She says it in a melodramatic way.
00:25:29 She's narrating a movie or something.
00:25:35 I think, you know, I just wanted to live with no regrets.
00:25:38 Yeah, I just...
00:25:42 And the other one is like scared and nervous.
00:25:46 And sometimes she starts crying.
00:25:48 But then other times she gets really animated
00:25:50 and she starts just rattling off facts
00:25:52 about the creepy pasta wiki.
00:25:54 She just starts explaining to the cop
00:25:56 who Zalgo is and who Slenderman is
00:25:58 and who Jack the Killer is.
00:26:01 Jack the Ripper, you mean?
00:26:03 I mean, Jack the Killer, I mean...
00:26:06 Jack the Ripper.
00:26:07 Oh, there's only one killer in the world.
00:26:09 There are Jacks.
00:26:10 There's Eilis Jack I learned
00:26:12 and there's...
00:26:13 Shit, there was another Jack too, but I forget.
00:26:17 And it's honestly...
00:26:18 She says she doesn't believe it anymore.
00:26:22 She says that while they were on the run,
00:26:24 like while they were walking down the highway,
00:26:26 trying to walk to the woods of Wisconsin
00:26:30 to find the Slender Mansion.
00:26:33 Like apparently they start...
00:26:35 The Slender Mansion.
00:26:36 Yeah, they literally were walking down the highway
00:26:38 in the direction of what they thought
00:26:40 the Slender Mansion was.
00:26:42 And they like started...
00:26:44 They like broke down and started crying on the sidewalk,
00:26:46 or not the sidewalk, the shoulder of the road.
00:26:49 And apparently the schizophrenic one
00:26:52 basically like cried out in prayer
00:26:55 to Slenderman like save us.
00:26:57 And nothing happened.
00:26:59 And it like shattered the other one's faith.
00:27:02 It shattered her faith that Slenderman was real
00:27:04 and now she doesn't believe it anymore.
00:27:06 How old were they?
00:27:08 12.
00:27:09 I think they were like 12.
00:27:11 Yeah, too old, too old for this.
00:27:14 But they seem to believe it.
00:27:17 They seem pretty...
00:27:18 Well, no, that one seems to believe it.
00:27:20 The other one, the schizophrenic one,
00:27:22 it's a little harder to tell.
00:27:23 She seems really like detached.
00:27:27 Don't go on the internet.
00:27:28 Do not go on the internet.
00:27:34 I don't know much about this other kid
00:27:37 that I've seen like footage of.
00:27:39 Morgan was the schizophrenic one
00:27:42 and Anissa was the other one.
00:27:46 No, no, I mean like I've heard of a different one
00:27:48 that was like the inspiration for Cara in Undertale.
00:27:52 It's like a little girl looks just like Frisk
00:27:55 who is being interviewed saying,
00:27:58 like just admitting that she puts needles in her little brother.
00:28:02 Oh, I've never heard about that.
00:28:05 Yeah, this is like little kid wearing like a similar jumper
00:28:08 to Frisk from Undertale
00:28:09 and she's got like the little bob hair thing.
00:28:12 She's just admitting to this interview
00:28:14 that she does terrible things
00:28:15 and she's like, obviously doesn't care
00:28:17 about the consequences or the ramifications.
00:28:20 It's just like, yeah, I just do it.
00:28:22 It's like, it's really creepy.
00:28:24 Like she's like five or something.
00:28:27 Gross.
00:28:28 No, I didn't even know about that.
00:28:31 Scary.
00:28:33 Kids are fucked up.
00:28:34 We should end kids.
00:28:35 Bring back abortion, baby.
00:28:38 This is because they banned abortion.
00:28:41 That's why the Slender Man killings happened.
00:28:43 Yes.
00:28:48 They're just so chunibio about it.
00:28:54 They were planning to fucking kawaii
00:28:57 when they stabbed that girl.
00:28:59 They were planning it for like...
00:29:02 Oh, it's so awful.
00:29:03 They were planning it for like months.
00:29:06 They were going to have like a sleepover
00:29:08 and they were going to do it at the...
00:29:10 They were going to have these three of them
00:29:11 were going to sleep over
00:29:12 and they were going to like stab her in her sleep
00:29:15 and then run away in the middle of the night.
00:29:17 But I guess it didn't work out for some reason.
00:29:19 They couldn't do that.
00:29:20 One of them said...
00:29:22 The Schizophrenic one said...
00:29:24 Morgan said,
00:29:25 I'm going to set my alarm in my headphones.
00:29:27 I'm going to set the alarm for the middle of the night.
00:29:29 We're going to...
00:29:30 And I'll wake you up in the middle of the night
00:29:31 and that's when we'll do it.
00:29:32 And I guess she didn't set the alarm.
00:29:35 It seemed...
00:29:36 They both seemed to like not have really wanted to do it.
00:29:39 They both...
00:29:40 They both talk about it.
00:29:41 Like it's just this fatalistic thing that like...
00:29:43 Well, we just had to do.
00:29:45 There was nothing we could do.
00:29:48 And she...
00:29:49 I mean, I kind of understand like kid mindset
00:29:53 where like if one of them tells the other,
00:29:55 our parents are going to die
00:29:57 if we don't do what Slenderman says.
00:29:59 And they almost like,
00:30:00 Oh, no.
00:30:01 Oh, no.
00:30:02 And they just believe it.
00:30:03 But I don't know.
00:30:05 The going that far seems abnormal.
00:30:08 I mean, yeah, for sure.
00:30:10 They both think the other one is the one that told them
00:30:13 that like Slenderman will kill our families
00:30:15 if we don't do this.
00:30:17 Neither of them thinks it was their idea.
00:30:19 Which is very strange.
00:30:22 They both sort of paint the other one as like the leader
00:30:25 and they were just a follower.
00:30:29 Yeah, but she didn't set her alarm.
00:30:32 She didn't set her alarm.
00:30:34 And so the next morning they wake up
00:30:36 and Morgan says,
00:30:38 Anissa was angry at me for not setting my alarm
00:30:41 so we didn't do it.
00:30:42 But Anissa says,
00:30:43 Morgan was being nice.
00:30:44 She let me sleep in
00:30:46 because I didn't want to do it.
00:30:48 So I guess they went,
00:30:49 they only went to the park and they were like playing,
00:30:51 they were playing hide and seek in the park
00:30:53 and they did it in like a,
00:30:55 in like a cops of trees.
00:30:57 Wait, this is great.
00:30:58 This is great.
00:30:59 They said,
00:31:01 Anissa said now and Morgan jumped.
00:31:05 Okay.
00:31:06 Morgan says that Anissa says now Kitty
00:31:09 because Kitty was like Morgan's code name.
00:31:12 Kitty says my code name.
00:31:15 You know, Morgan says my code name was Kitty
00:31:17 and Anissa's code name was Scorpion.
00:31:20 And she says that Anissa says now,
00:31:23 and Anissa says that she said now
00:31:25 and then Morgan said,
00:31:26 don't be scared.
00:31:27 I'm just a little kitty
00:31:29 and jumped on her and stabbed her.
00:31:31 Apparently they were going to,
00:31:33 her plan was to become,
00:31:35 when she ascended to the ranks of,
00:31:38 you know,
00:31:39 someone on the creepypasta wiki,
00:31:41 someone who lived in the slender mansion,
00:31:43 like killer name was going to be Kitty
00:31:45 and she was going to draw whiskers on her face.
00:31:47 But then that was going to be her gimmick.
00:31:49 Oh my God.
00:31:50 Yeah.
00:31:51 But then she says,
00:31:54 no, Anissa gave me that name
00:31:56 just because I have cats
00:31:57 and she says I act like a cat sometimes.
00:31:59 Like Anissa says that I'm Kitty.
00:32:01 It wasn't my idea.
00:32:06 It's really bizarre.
00:32:07 They both,
00:32:08 yeah, they're 12,
00:32:09 so they're too old for this.
00:32:11 But they act like,
00:32:13 they act like little kids,
00:32:14 like maybe like eight or 10,
00:32:16 which is not like super weird for a 12 year old.
00:32:18 Like some kids are just like that.
00:32:20 But they're acting like it.
00:32:22 While they're talking about like,
00:32:23 yeah, yeah, we stabbed our friend.
00:32:25 And apparently they,
00:32:26 Morgan did the stabbing
00:32:27 and then the one that they stabbed
00:32:30 is just kind of like crying out in pain
00:32:33 and like she's yelling at them like,
00:32:35 I hate you.
00:32:36 I trusted you.
00:32:37 How could you do this to me?
00:32:38 And then like crying because it hurts.
00:32:40 And they're just like, okay,
00:32:42 well, we're going to go get help.
00:32:45 You stay here.
00:32:47 But secretly they weren't going to get help.
00:32:48 They were just going to run away
00:32:49 to Slender Mansion and let her die.
00:32:52 She had to die.
00:32:53 It was all part of the plan.
00:32:54 There was nothing they could do.
00:32:56 There was nothing they could do.
00:32:59 It's so, it's so odd
00:33:01 because like the way you're describing it,
00:33:03 it is sort of like a little kid plan
00:33:05 to like steal from the cookie jar.
00:33:07 It sounds like they were all
00:33:09 talking about it like they were like,
00:33:10 they talk about it like they were playing a game.
00:33:13 Yeah, but like because they had read
00:33:15 what was the wiki thing?
00:33:17 The creepypasta wiki.
00:33:18 The creepypasta wiki that they just,
00:33:21 they thought that that was harmless
00:33:23 or maybe, I don't know, how do you,
00:33:27 I suppose if you've never like dealt
00:33:29 with like blood and death.
00:33:31 Yeah.
00:33:32 You wouldn't really think about it
00:33:33 until it's suddenly there and it's like,
00:33:35 oh no.
00:33:38 Terrible, terrible situation.
00:33:40 Morgan says that like,
00:33:42 oh, Anisa was the one that wanted to do it.
00:33:44 It was Anisa's idea.
00:33:46 But then when the time came,
00:33:48 she couldn't do it.
00:33:49 She made me do it.
00:33:50 She gave me the knife and said,
00:33:52 you have to be the one to do it.
00:33:53 I can't do it.
00:33:54 I'm too scared.
00:33:56 And Anisa says like,
00:33:58 yeah, Anisa also says like I was too scared.
00:34:01 I couldn't do it.
00:34:02 I'm too squeamish.
00:34:03 I'm too nice of a person.
00:34:05 I'm too nice of a person.
00:34:06 I couldn't stab someone.
00:34:07 I could hurt myself,
00:34:08 but like if it was someone else's blood,
00:34:10 I couldn't stand it.
00:34:11 I couldn't look at that.
00:34:13 And that's like hours after conspiring
00:34:16 to murder her friend and stabbing her
00:34:18 in the cops of trees in the park.
00:34:21 It's unclear if Anisa did any stabbing herself.
00:34:24 It sounds like no.
00:34:27 But really is it really do be like,
00:34:30 don't go on the internet.
00:34:32 Don't end up on the creepypasta wiki
00:34:35 and get weird ideas when you're that young.
00:34:38 It's clear that these two are like,
00:34:40 there's something wrong with these two.
00:34:42 But also it's not like so profoundly wrong
00:34:46 that it's like this is inevitable.
00:34:47 Like they were like natural serial killers.
00:34:49 I think it was like a weird perfect storm
00:34:52 of like these two girls have something wrong with them.
00:34:55 And then they fall down this rabbit hole of lore
00:34:58 about, you know, these like sexy monster killers.
00:35:02 And there's all these like legends on the internet
00:35:05 that you can become one of them.
00:35:07 And then the two of them like fed off of each other
00:35:10 and like talked about it and like and validated one another
00:35:13 is like weird beliefs about it.
00:35:16 And then they said like, like they don't talk about
00:35:18 like they didn't ever want it.
00:35:20 They didn't even seem to want to do it.
00:35:22 They don't have any plans to do it again.
00:35:23 They never thought about doing anything like this
00:35:25 to anyone else.
00:35:26 They don't like kill small animals or anything like that.
00:35:30 It seems like like a really weird one up one off event
00:35:34 that just happened due to a bizarre confluence of factors.
00:35:42 Oh, I watched another one about a lady
00:35:44 who left her baby in the dumpster.
00:35:47 That was fucked up.
00:35:49 Yeah.
00:35:50 Some people found a baby in the dumpster and they're asked there.
00:35:55 That one was kind of sad.
00:35:58 I mean, I don't know.
00:36:00 The lady like she knows what she did was wrong.
00:36:03 She doesn't really have like an explanation for it.
00:36:06 She just she said she was scared,
00:36:08 but she doesn't really like explain what she was scared of.
00:36:12 Like she doesn't say that like, oh, I couldn't afford it.
00:36:16 Like I couldn't take care of a baby.
00:36:18 She apparently hid the pregnancy from her parents,
00:36:22 which might be maybe she was scared that like
00:36:25 her mom was going to be mad that she got pregnant
00:36:28 and she found out so she hid the whole thing
00:36:30 and then discarded the evidence basically.
00:36:34 And that's like, yeah.
00:36:37 This whole thing sounds like a real fucked up thing to watch.
00:36:43 I don't.
00:36:44 Yeah.
00:36:45 I mean, I guess I can see why it would be interesting.
00:36:49 Yeah, it's.
00:36:53 I mean, if I if I think the I think the there's a lot of videos.
00:36:56 I think the other only other one to watch it only watched a few
00:36:58 because I just started these like yesterday.
00:37:00 The last one was about like a girl like an emo girl
00:37:03 like a legit emo girl back in like 2008 or something who just
00:37:08 like just who just for fun like just to see what it felt like
00:37:12 like murdered her neighbor like her younger neighbor girl in like
00:37:16 the woods like strangled her slitter throat and then like
00:37:19 buried her and she has and she has the interview with her
00:37:23 grandma in the in the room.
00:37:25 And when she admits that she slipped the throat,
00:37:28 the grandma like freaks out and starts like crying
00:37:31 and screaming and stuff.
00:37:32 And like, yeah, that's fair.
00:37:34 I don't like hearing about any of this.
00:37:36 So I'm sorry.
00:37:43 Okay, the one thing I want to say about that is that
00:37:45 one's kind of that one's sort of interest sort of I want to say funny.
00:37:49 But that one's funny.
00:37:50 It's funny because she's like an emo girl and she has all these
00:37:53 pictures of her like Facebook or whatever that have like pictures
00:37:58 of her look an emo like she's got some like blood on her mouth.
00:38:01 Like she put on like fake blood and like posed with like her
00:38:05 teeth there like she's a vampire or something and they keep
00:38:08 showing these photos to show like what a what a person of
00:38:11 violent tendency she was.
00:38:13 But like it kind of just looks like any any emo girl might
00:38:17 have taken these anyone would like paint themselves to look
00:38:20 like a vampire and like pose like that.
00:38:22 It's not weird.
00:38:24 But I guess in this particular case it was.
00:38:27 I mean, it depends on who your audiences are definitely with
00:38:31 it.
00:38:32 There's definitely a type of conservative that's like we're like
00:38:35 having dyed hair or any piercings at all.
00:38:38 Like you're immediately a terrible terrible awful degenerate
00:38:41 person go away.
00:38:43 She didn't even look at you.
00:38:45 I mean, she had like kind of an emo haircut.
00:38:48 But she didn't have like blue hair.
00:38:50 She didn't have like a septum piercings or anything like that.
00:38:54 She's kind of had bangs and eye shadow.
00:38:57 I don't know.
00:38:58 They're scared eye shadow.
00:38:59 That's that's pretty extreme.
00:39:01 That's it's gone.
00:39:02 It's too far.
00:39:03 We've gone too far to even accept.
00:39:06 We used to live in a country, a real country.
00:39:09 We're we're we're sexualizing children by letting six year old
00:39:14 16 year olds put on eye shadow.
00:39:17 It's we have to return to.
00:39:21 We have to return to the ancient Roman days when they would
00:39:24 I'm sure they would use some weird fucked up shit for makeup.
00:39:27 Yeah, just like straight up lead.
00:39:31 Just metal.
00:39:34 They would have chrome faces.
00:39:36 The iron the iron mask.
00:39:38 They would.
00:39:39 Yeah, instead of they didn't have makeup, so they would get bolted
00:39:42 into like an iron.
00:39:48 That's reasonable.
00:39:50 Calcum all over.
00:39:52 Right.
00:39:56 But I've learned a lot about Tolkien as well.
00:39:58 I've learned I've learned a lot about horrific murders and
00:40:02 Tolkien.
00:40:04 And that's damn you.
00:40:06 You be tubing.
00:40:07 I'd be tubing.
00:40:08 I've been tubing this week.
00:40:10 I've been I've been working.
00:40:11 I've been working and tubing at the same time.
00:40:14 Incredible.
00:40:16 Yeah.
00:40:18 Here's a here's a fun fact.
00:40:20 In the movies.
00:40:22 Aragorn wears a ring that is never really explained what it is.
00:40:27 But in the books, he doesn't wear the ring, but he does have the
00:40:31 ring and there is like a long history of like who owned this
00:40:34 ring and where it came from and such and such.
00:40:37 And it's not a ring of power or anything.
00:40:39 It's just a regular ring.
00:40:41 But it's actually like made by the elves in like in the first
00:40:45 age and it's like it's literally the oldest thing like in the
00:40:49 world.
00:40:50 It's like the oldest piece of jewelry in the world.
00:40:52 It's older than the sun.
00:40:54 But yeah.
00:40:56 Because I get the heat.
00:40:58 Because I well, I guess when I guess in the early days of
00:41:01 Middle Earth, there was no sun and moon.
00:41:03 There were just the stars and the land was lit by these two
00:41:07 like magical trees, like a golden tree and a silver tree.
00:41:12 And I don't know exactly how the sun happened, but it's at some
00:41:16 point it was created and this ring was made like before that.
00:41:20 So Aragorn just casually has this like 10,000 year old
00:41:26 fucking ring.
00:41:27 He's got.
00:41:30 Yeah.
00:41:31 Also, also, did you know that Gandalf has a ring of power the
00:41:36 whole time?
00:41:39 No.
00:41:40 Yeah, he's got rings of power would corrupt would were
00:41:43 corruptive.
00:41:44 They are.
00:41:45 Is it just the one ring?
00:41:46 The one ring is worse.
00:41:48 They are they are all corruptive, but Gandalf has one of the
00:41:52 one of the he has one of the three.
00:41:54 Okay.
00:41:55 Okay.
00:41:56 So, um, oh God, what's the name of the guy?
00:41:58 Guy who forged the airy rings.
00:42:01 It's not cuckoo lane.
00:42:03 Caleb Rimbour.
00:42:05 This guy Caleb Rimbour.
00:42:06 Sauron taught Caleb Rimbour how to make rings.
00:42:10 And so he made they made seven rings for the dwarves and nine
00:42:13 rings for the for men.
00:42:15 And then Caleb Rimbour was like, hey, I'm going to go away.
00:42:19 Thanks, Sauron.
00:42:20 Thanks.
00:42:21 Thanks for all the secret lore.
00:42:22 Thanks for the ring lore, Sauron.
00:42:24 You sucker.
00:42:25 And he went off by himself and he secretly crafted three
00:42:28 rings for the elves.
00:42:30 And, uh, I think, um, uh, Elrond has one.
00:42:35 And another guy in a du-
00:42:37 Galadriel?
00:42:38 No, Galadriel does not have one.
00:42:40 Oh, she was in the movie.
00:42:42 I remember that scene right at the beginning where she has a
00:42:45 ring.
00:42:46 You pretty sure it's her?
00:42:48 Uh, maybe.
00:42:50 Like three rings were gifted to the race of elves.
00:42:53 One.
00:42:54 Okay.
00:42:55 Maybe it was one of either her or Elrond had one.
00:42:58 Um, there's a ring of, like, I think it's a ring of air or
00:43:00 a ring of water and a ring of fire.
00:43:03 And yeah, um, this guy called, uh, is it Collane the Shipwright
00:43:08 or something?
00:43:09 This other guy, I guess when, when the Maiar who became the
00:43:12 wizards came to Arda, uh, they, uh, fucking, uh, what's,
00:43:19 what's his name?
00:43:20 Tolkien the Shipwrights.
00:43:24 C-Cyrdan.
00:43:25 Cyrdan, this is the shipwright.
00:43:27 He's this elven.
00:43:28 I guess he's a king of something.
00:43:30 Uh, when the, when the Maiar that became the wizards came to
00:43:33 Arda, I guess this guy Cyrdan, like, met them.
00:43:36 And he had this, this one, Caleb Rimbour made this one, I
00:43:40 think, Venya or Nunya or something.
00:43:42 It was the fire ring.
00:43:43 And he had it.
00:43:44 And he met all the Maiar and he's like, okay, yeah, cool.
00:43:47 Nice to meet you.
00:43:48 Thanks for coming to Arda to help out with like the work of
00:43:51 God or whatever.
00:43:52 Uh, but then he met, he met Gandalf last and Gandalf was, I
00:43:56 guess, he, I guess he was just better than the others.
00:43:58 And he was like, okay, actually this one's like, I really like
00:44:01 this one.
00:44:02 So he gifted him the, the ring, the elven ring of fire.
00:44:05 And he's like, here, just keep this just in case.
00:44:08 Um, and I guess when, when Gandalf is fighting the Balrog,
00:44:14 he's throws it, he throws out a bunch of like, he's trying to
00:44:17 like intimidate the Balrog and he says, I am so and so, uh, you
00:44:20 know, bearer of the, he says something like I am the bearer
00:44:24 of like the flame of the West or something.
00:44:26 And it's like, it might be that he's talking.
00:44:29 The flame of Arnor, I remember him saying.
00:44:31 Yes.
00:44:32 Yeah.
00:44:33 And he, I think he's talking about that he has this fucking
00:44:35 ring.
00:44:36 Wow.
00:44:37 Yeah.
00:44:38 But it's like,
00:44:39 That was just like a, like a, like a skill tree.
00:44:41 Like he knows fire magic.
00:44:43 Yeah.
00:44:44 Like he's, he's, he's specked into fire magic right now.
00:44:47 And, and, uh, despite.
00:44:49 One shot you bro.
00:44:50 And despite what you might think, uh, uh, Balrogs actually
00:44:53 are not resistant to fire elemental damage.
00:44:55 So you better watch out.
00:44:57 Sir.
00:44:58 Um, yes, I have, I have learned many interesting Tolkien
00:45:03 facts, uh, of that, of that sort.
00:45:07 Tolkien, more like token.
00:45:11 No.
00:45:13 We.
00:45:14 Damn.
00:45:15 Well.
00:45:16 A couple of weeks ago, I talked on the podcast about how
00:45:20 there was a remake of one of my favorite games that was
00:45:23 coming out and how it had a really bad, but then the new
00:45:27 remake looks better.
00:45:28 And that was clenoa.
00:45:30 And I played it.
00:45:32 And, uh, and, uh, it's, it's, it's flawed.
00:45:39 Um, I have to say.
00:45:41 Oh no.
00:45:42 I've seen, I've seen some looking screenshots of the
00:45:46 clenoa and it looks cool from what I saw.
00:45:49 I don't know anything about clenoa.
00:45:52 What is clenoa?
00:45:53 Okay.
00:45:54 I mean, I've seen the character.
00:45:55 Uh, read it.
00:45:56 Yeah.
00:45:57 Just read it.
00:45:58 So.
00:45:59 Is it a 3D platformer collectathon?
00:46:01 It's a 2.5 D.
00:46:03 What if a Sonic character was their own series?
00:46:06 No.
00:46:07 Hmm.
00:46:08 Well, okay.
00:46:09 So here, look, I'll just grab some of the comparisons that
00:46:11 I made today.
00:46:12 Uh, so like overall, like the new game looks good.
00:46:18 Maybe even looks better in a lot of places.
00:46:21 The, the, the problem, there's a couple of problems I
00:46:24 have for one, the controls are like clunkier.
00:46:26 I don't know how that happened, but, um, there's just
00:46:30 little details missing that just make me sad.
00:46:32 So if you look at the top, uh, left image, you'll see
00:46:36 in the background that you can see a waterfall with
00:46:38 some platforms.
00:46:39 That's actually level two.
00:46:41 You can see level two in the backdrop of level one.
00:46:44 And that's a cute little detail of it they put in.
00:46:46 Sure.
00:46:47 Um, and then the remake they just forgot is just a
00:46:50 waterfall with no platforms.
00:46:52 Uh, that's, that is, that's cringe.
00:46:57 That's cringe.
00:46:58 It's cringe.
00:46:59 It looks a little bit like a Kirby return to
00:47:03 Dream Mind or whatever.
00:47:05 Uh, it is, from other games I've seen, it is most
00:47:08 similar to Kirby, I would say.
00:47:10 Um, so like, okay, like, that's just, it's just
00:47:15 sad.
00:47:16 There's just a lot of like little things where it's
00:47:18 like, where they just forgot to put something in
00:47:20 or they forgot a sound effect.
00:47:22 Or there's like a cool sound effect in the original
00:47:24 and then like in, you know, you know, the new version,
00:47:27 there's just no sound effect at all.
00:47:29 Or it's just being replaced with like a generic
00:47:31 sound effect that like just blends in with everything
00:47:33 else that you, that doesn't stand out at all.
00:47:36 Um, little things like that that are annoying.
00:47:38 Um, the sound mixing is fucking awful.
00:47:42 Um, like some of the character's voices are
00:47:45 perpetually like way too fucking quiet.
00:47:48 Uh, Joker's voice is super quiet throughout the
00:47:50 whole game, but our character's voices are really
00:47:53 loud.
00:47:54 Is there no options for that?
00:47:56 It's so bizarre.
00:47:57 There's a voice volume option that changes everyone's
00:48:00 voices like linearly.
00:48:02 They're still proportionally
00:48:04 wrong compared to each other.
00:48:06 I see.
00:48:07 It's weird whenever that happens in a game.
00:48:09 Like, I don't know, whenever, whenever some
00:48:12 YouTuber is explaining like why some game is bad
00:48:15 and then he's like, this is not edited.
00:48:17 I did not edit this.
00:48:18 It actually sounds like this.
00:48:20 And then they play a clip that's like, you just
00:48:22 literally like can't hear characters talking over
00:48:24 like the background music or something.
00:48:26 I'm always like, I can't, I can't believe
00:48:28 things like that happen.
00:48:30 It's not even that rare, but it's like, how do you,
00:48:32 how does that happen?
00:48:34 It's so bad.
00:48:35 The original game didn't have any issues at all
00:48:37 like that.
00:48:38 It's, it sounded fine.
00:48:39 You can hear everything clearly.
00:48:40 Um, like during, during Joker's boss fight,
00:48:44 he has this like spinning attack where he
00:48:46 spins around really fast.
00:48:47 I'm the Joker's baby.
00:48:48 He's Joker.
00:48:49 Um, he, and, and the original game was like
00:48:51 a swish, swish, swish.
00:48:53 It's like this really like loud swishing sound
00:48:55 that you jump.
00:48:56 And then the remake, it's like negative like
00:48:58 30 decibels.
00:48:59 You have to like strain so hard.
00:49:01 It's like almost not even there.
00:49:03 Um, there's like one of the boss fights,
00:49:05 like over half the sound effects are just
00:49:07 missing.
00:49:08 Um, you just don't hear anything.
00:49:10 It doesn't have footsteps.
00:49:11 It doesn't have anything when it's running around.
00:49:13 It's just bizarre.
00:49:15 And that was just really weird and sad and
00:49:18 dumb, I guess.
00:49:20 Um, sound design is sometimes overlooked
00:49:23 as a very important aspect.
00:49:25 It's, it's one of the music, but like good
00:49:27 sounds like mastering and like
00:49:30 levels and shit.
00:49:32 It's like, um, it's like editing, you know,
00:49:34 the best editing is invisible and you don't
00:49:36 even notice it.
00:49:37 Sound editing.
00:49:38 Good, good, good sound editing you don't
00:49:40 even think about.
00:49:41 But when, when it's fucked up, you're like,
00:49:43 Oh God.
00:49:44 Oh no.
00:49:45 What the fuck is wrong?
00:49:46 Yeah.
00:49:47 So, so what I learned is that the reason
00:49:50 there are so many weird like changes that
00:49:52 didn't make sense or things missing is
00:49:54 because this wasn't a remake of the original
00:49:56 game.
00:49:57 It was a remaster of the Wii remake, which
00:49:59 was bad.
00:50:01 Um, hmm.
00:50:03 What was it originally on?
00:50:06 It was originally on the PlayStation 1.
00:50:08 Came out in 1997.
00:50:10 Uh, it looks so lovely.
00:50:13 Yeah, the small amount of pixels.
00:50:15 Yeah.
00:50:16 Perfect.
00:50:17 But like, has it been, has it been two weeks
00:50:19 since I, since I talked about Mega Man
00:50:21 Legends or was that last week?
00:50:23 Maybe.
00:50:24 I don't know.
00:50:25 I haven't watched, uh, I haven't listened to.
00:50:27 No, that would have been two, yeah.
00:50:28 It's been, it's been two weeks and I still
00:50:30 have not gotten around to playing Legends
00:50:32 too.
00:50:33 I wanted to do it.
00:50:34 You should.
00:50:35 I will, I will.
00:50:36 I just haven't found the time.
00:50:38 But anyway.
00:50:39 But yeah.
00:50:40 That's off topic.
00:50:41 I'd say most of the visual changes are
00:50:45 like lateral or an improvement, you know,
00:50:47 with the exception of these last two
00:50:49 screenshots, which are like, I don't know
00:50:51 why they got rid of like the really cool
00:50:53 dark colors and made everything super
00:50:55 bright Mario colors.
00:50:56 I don't know what's up with that.
00:50:58 Yeah.
00:50:59 Yeah.
00:51:00 I really liked, especially in the,
00:51:01 especially like the purple, um,
00:51:04 where you see the, the triple comparison.
00:51:06 I, I, I, I, I'm sad.
00:51:08 Oh.
00:51:09 So, cause that was a really pretty level.
00:51:11 Um, so the worst offense, and this is
00:51:14 a rant I have for all remakes.
00:51:17 Why do we get rid of pre-rendered cut
00:51:21 scenes when we remake games?
00:51:25 Cause every time I've seen this,
00:51:27 it looks fucking worse.
00:51:29 And I grab a bunch of comparisons,
00:51:31 uh, five, in fact.
00:51:33 Um, and it's just, it's just fucking
00:51:39 bad.
00:51:40 It's baffling.
00:51:42 Yeah.
00:51:43 They do it in engine because they
00:51:44 technically can.
00:51:45 We can do it in engine now.
00:51:46 And it's like, the original looks fine.
00:51:50 It wasn't originally in engine.
00:51:52 So, or, so like, why does it need
00:51:55 to be in engine?
00:51:56 Yeah.
00:51:57 Because we've moved on from that.
00:51:59 It's a new era of gaming.
00:52:01 Yeah.
00:52:02 Is it like, is the, is the idea that
00:52:04 like it needs to match and like,
00:52:07 it just needs to have the same.
00:52:09 I think.
00:52:10 Style to it.
00:52:11 I think it's, it's just sort of a
00:52:13 general sense that at the time full
00:52:16 motion video was like cutting edge.
00:52:18 It was a way to flex that you could
00:52:21 now you could put things on a CD.
00:52:23 You could have so much space to put
00:52:24 movie like video files and you could
00:52:28 you could animate better than what
00:52:29 could be done in the game normally.
00:52:31 Um, but now that games can do so much
00:52:35 more, it's sort of seen as regressive
00:52:38 to do like a thing because it's, oh,
00:52:41 that's cutting edge.
00:52:42 But for yesteryear and it's like,
00:52:44 it's like, now we do this thing.
00:52:47 I mean, like computer graphics and
00:52:50 animation has come so far, they could
00:52:52 still be cutting edge and just do like
00:52:53 an even better pre-rendered cutscene.
00:52:56 I mean, they could.
00:52:57 It's very time intensive because you
00:53:00 have to like storyboard it and like
00:53:02 think about it.
00:53:03 It's already thought about just do
00:53:05 what they already did.
00:53:07 Well, first, I mean, I mean,
00:53:09 why not just use the old ones?
00:53:11 Is the idea that they look too primitive?
00:53:14 I mean, what do you see on the left is
00:53:16 an AI upscale and it looks great.
00:53:18 It looks perfectly fine.
00:53:20 The design of the character is the same.
00:53:24 It's a fan-made AI upscale.
00:53:26 Why does he have Pac-Man on his hat?
00:53:28 Because Namco.
00:53:29 You see a gamer?
00:53:30 Oh, oh, I see.
00:53:32 It's Namco.
00:53:33 They put Pac-Man on his hat.
00:53:34 It's a little funny thing.
00:53:36 Oh, the second to last one is so egregious.
00:53:39 The guy's no expression.
00:53:41 Yeah, they just forgot to animate.
00:53:43 The first one, the first one where he's
00:53:45 snarling has so much more personality.
00:53:47 They lost so much.
00:53:49 Did that change?
00:53:51 That blows.
00:53:53 The little orb is so like
00:53:55 fucking geometric instead of
00:53:57 being a little like ethereal ball of light
00:53:59 like he was in the first one.
00:54:00 Yeah, some of these are just
00:54:02 straight downgrades.
00:54:03 Some of these, I think, and not even
00:54:05 in like a four of the time way, I would
00:54:07 just say straight up.
00:54:08 Some of these looked better.
00:54:10 Just straight up looked better.
00:54:11 And even technically, they don't look
00:54:13 like for all five of these videos
00:54:15 on a technical level, it just
00:54:17 looks better.
00:54:19 And the animation's better.
00:54:21 Like, for example,
00:54:23 in the final one, like, you know,
00:54:25 the flying fish, you see her actually
00:54:27 like swishing her tail around.
00:54:29 They actually put effort into animating
00:54:31 her moving gracefully.
00:54:33 And this one, it's just, they just
00:54:35 fast tween that are across the screen.
00:54:37 Yeah.
00:54:39 They just lazily just slapped it
00:54:41 together without any thought.
00:54:43 Yeah, I got to wonder,
00:54:45 like, obviously
00:54:47 time investment of making
00:54:49 like remaking a cutscene if they
00:54:51 didn't have the original like files or whatever
00:54:55 would take time. It's like, ah, we don't
00:54:57 want to spend time. That could be part of it.
00:54:59 Probably always is.
00:55:01 But like, how much of it is
00:55:03 the idea that
00:55:05 full motion video cutscenes that are not
00:55:07 rendered in engine is like
00:55:09 old fashioned.
00:55:11 We don't do them anymore.
00:55:13 But there's no reason
00:55:15 we don't do them anymore. It's just that they
00:55:17 are like a symbol of a different
00:55:19 era. I guess.
00:55:21 Like, do people, would the game studio
00:55:23 be like, wouldn't even think
00:55:25 to do that because, oh yeah, it's
00:55:27 we don't need to do that. So we won't.
00:55:29 There is one studio that does.
00:55:31 It's so frustrating that it's like
00:55:33 things that are invented
00:55:35 in video games and other
00:55:37 mediums, I guess, just
00:55:39 that they become
00:55:41 like.
00:55:43 They should be used as tools that you could
00:55:45 use forever.
00:55:47 But they get abandoned for
00:55:49 fashion.
00:55:51 Unless you're Final Fantasy
00:55:53 which still does pre-rendered
00:55:55 cutscenes and they look really great
00:55:57 and they still flex with that.
00:55:59 Yeah, Final Fantasy has always been good
00:56:01 with that.
00:56:03 Those big old things. I guess World of Warcraft
00:56:05 still does them. Every new
00:56:07 expansion. There's a film that is like a
00:56:09 really nicely animated
00:56:11 intro.
00:56:13 The most recent one is like, oh, that's
00:56:15 that's a nice little like short
00:56:17 film. Game looks
00:56:19 like it sucks because it always does.
00:56:21 But yeah.
00:56:23 That's life.
00:56:25 I mean, League of Legends is a good example of that.
00:56:27 They make all kinds of really fucking cool
00:56:29 amazing animations.
00:56:31 But the game is shit.
00:56:33 Yeah.
00:56:35 For sure.
00:56:37 25 years.
00:56:39 A difference.
00:56:41 And it just looks fucking so much worse.
00:56:43 I want pre-rendered
00:56:45 backdrops
00:56:47 to come back with static cameras.
00:56:49 I want pre-rendered cutscenes.
00:56:51 I think
00:56:53 it's like we couldn't do
00:56:55 such good cutscenes
00:56:57 in engine.
00:56:59 And so like the new flex
00:57:01 has been to do them in engine.
00:57:03 And now people are just getting
00:57:05 lazy with it and doing this
00:57:07 Klanowa thing.
00:57:09 They've forgotten where
00:57:11 who they are.
00:57:13 What are they fighting for?
00:57:15 Why go through
00:57:17 the trouble of a redo if you're just going to be
00:57:19 lazy about it?
00:57:21 If you're just like going to make it like
00:57:23 you're not going to even try.
00:57:25 I could see doing it if you thought
00:57:27 like, oh, I've got to, we could surpass
00:57:29 the original. We can make it look better.
00:57:31 But it doesn't really look like they even tried.
00:57:33 So.
00:57:35 I can't think of really any remake
00:57:37 off the top of my head that did
00:57:39 do it because they could try.
00:57:41 They wanted to try and make it better.
00:57:43 I think it's almost always
00:57:45 like, I mean we can cash in on the brand
00:57:47 recognition on this one.
00:57:49 Just do it again.
00:57:51 That's always how it is.
00:57:53 I don't know if Klanowa is
00:57:55 like a super hot license.
00:57:57 I mean, it's our license.
00:57:59 It's a thing people know.
00:58:01 And so it's easier than making an entirely
00:58:03 new game. I have heard of it.
00:58:05 Try to market that.
00:58:07 The one good thing I
00:58:09 can say about the remake is just
00:58:11 it is hurt by the mixing, but
00:58:13 the soundtrack sounds better
00:58:15 whenever.
00:58:17 Original composer still on the
00:58:19 still on board. I found his YouTube channel.
00:58:21 He does little remixes of Klanowa stuff
00:58:23 every so often. He just has a YouTube channel.
00:58:25 And that's sweet. He made
00:58:27 my favorite soundtracks of all time.
00:58:29 Yeah, the original composer.
00:58:31 Wow. Cool.
00:58:33 He just has a YouTube channel.
00:58:35 He's a cool guy.
00:58:37 I'll just link his channel, I guess.
00:58:39 It's
00:58:41 Kota Takahashi.
00:58:43 It's not
00:58:45 a remake.
00:58:47 It's more of a demake, but I decided
00:58:49 just to see what was up.
00:58:51 I decided to play
00:58:53 DOS PC
00:58:55 Mega Man games.
00:58:57 You ever seen those?
00:58:59 Oh, I have seen those.
00:59:01 I think...
00:59:03 Are they canon? Are they different?
00:59:05 I...
00:59:07 I guess I don't see why they wouldn't
00:59:09 be canon, because
00:59:11 they were officially licensed.
00:59:13 I mean, they're not mentioned anywhere.
00:59:15 They are very
00:59:17 strange. You could tell that
00:59:19 it was not made by the team.
00:59:21 The
00:59:23 bosses
00:59:25 have terrible AI. They mostly just
00:59:27 hop. They mostly just hop back
00:59:29 and forth and occasionally shoot off a bullet.
00:59:31 They do not look
00:59:33 like robot masters at all, basically.
00:59:35 All their
00:59:37 in-game
00:59:39 portrait sprites are just sloppy edits
00:59:41 of ones from the real games.
00:59:43 There's no
00:59:45 music.
00:59:47 There's barely any sound...
00:59:49 There are sound effects, but they suck.
00:59:53 And the game's too fucking hard.
00:59:55 I played it with...
00:59:57 Fortunately, the game has built
00:59:59 an invincibility code, so I just enabled
01:00:01 those and played through. And I still got
01:00:03 stuck at a couple of places.
01:00:05 Wily's Castle
01:00:07 in Mega Man 3, the robots
01:00:09 are revolting.
01:00:11 Actually, it has parts where the platforming
01:00:13 is so...
01:00:15 There's a part where you are
01:00:17 on these pillars, and you have to jump from pillar
01:00:19 to pillar over this vat of
01:00:21 green bubbling goo or something.
01:00:23 Looked amazing,
01:00:25 obviously.
01:00:27 But...
01:00:29 I don't know
01:00:31 what was going on, but the frame
01:00:33 rate of the game would change
01:00:35 depending on where I was standing.
01:00:37 So sometimes I would make a jump
01:00:39 and the frame rate would just double.
01:00:41 Just for the length of the jump.
01:00:43 And I would obviously misjudge the length
01:00:45 of the jump and dive because the frame rate
01:00:47 was inconsistent.
01:00:49 So that was infuriating.
01:00:51 And it took me an hour to get past
01:00:53 that part. No, maybe not an hour.
01:00:55 But even with
01:00:57 no damage enabled, I still
01:00:59 couldn't beat that part, and I had to
01:01:01 replay the level like a dozen times.
01:01:03 Because it was too hard.
01:01:05 Fucking...
01:01:09 Wait, let me show you.
01:01:11 Mega Man, the robots are
01:01:13 revolting.
01:01:15 Look at Shark Man.
01:01:17 Whoa, he's a
01:01:19 shark eating a man.
01:01:21 He's a Shark Man.
01:01:23 Who's the second on the left?
01:01:25 The blue guy?
01:01:27 Wave Man.
01:01:29 Because he's a wave?
01:01:31 I don't know.
01:01:33 I guess he's underwater, but a lot of the levels
01:01:35 are in water.
01:01:37 Torch Man is the bottom guy.
01:01:39 And his weakness is Water Wave
01:01:41 from Wave Man.
01:01:43 But when you fight Torch Man, his arena
01:01:45 is underwater.
01:01:47 But there is water in his arena
01:01:49 and you're standing in several feet of water.
01:01:51 So I don't know
01:01:53 what's going on there.
01:01:57 Anyway, these were really
01:01:59 bad.
01:02:01 They're really hard though.
01:02:03 Maybe if it was back in
01:02:05 1999 or whatever the fuck
01:02:07 this was released and all you had was DOS.
01:02:09 This would give you a stiff challenge
01:02:11 that would probably take you
01:02:13 days or weeks
01:02:15 to successfully get through without
01:02:17 that no damage code.
01:02:19 So I mean, if you're just looking for a
01:02:21 stiff platforming challenge, I mean
01:02:23 this would provide that.
01:02:25 Also the levels were really big.
01:02:27 I got you a stiff platforming challenge right here.
01:02:29 Not the first one, because there's two.
01:02:31 There's Mega Man for PC
01:02:33 and then there's Mega Man 3, the robots are
01:02:35 revolting for PC. And there's no two
01:02:37 for some reason.
01:02:39 But the second one
01:02:41 Mega Man 3 actually has
01:02:43 really big levels that you can
01:02:45 get lost in and explore. I think in
01:02:47 Wave Man Stage
01:02:49 you're swimming through these coral reefs
01:02:51 and it actually felt huge
01:02:53 and I was like, wow.
01:02:55 It's actually not
01:02:57 totally terrible. Technology sure is amazing.
01:02:59 There's one or two good
01:03:01 positive things I could say about this
01:03:03 terrible game
01:03:05 which I think was just made by one
01:03:07 American guy
01:03:09 who
01:03:11 must have had some
01:03:13 Capcom association
01:03:15 and they were like, hey, you're an American.
01:03:17 Make some fucking PC ports
01:03:19 of our franchise, please.
01:03:21 And he said, oh, okay.
01:03:23 And he did. And it was great.
01:03:25 Um, okay.
01:03:27 I'm sorry. I guess I will.
01:03:29 Um,
01:03:31 yes, that was funny.
01:03:33 Uh,
01:03:35 that's it.
01:03:37 The last thing I have to say
01:03:39 about this week is that
01:03:41 my stupid, evil,
01:03:43 terrible landlord
01:03:45 has ordered
01:03:47 fucking work be done.
01:03:49 All throughout the week
01:03:51 I have to deal with fucking people
01:03:53 in my house
01:03:55 like doing construction
01:03:57 stuff.
01:03:59 And they keep like,
01:04:01 they keep suggesting to me
01:04:03 that they're going to need to work in my room
01:04:05 and then not
01:04:07 actually doing it.
01:04:09 And I hate that.
01:04:11 They say,
01:04:13 what do they say to you to suggest that?
01:04:15 Okay. Well, a couple of times a guy has been
01:04:17 like, hey, can I come in? I need to measure your room.
01:04:19 And I'm like, okay. And he comes in and he puts
01:04:21 the tape measure up and he measures how wide the room
01:04:23 is and he's like, okay. And then he leaves.
01:04:25 And then he'll say like, hey, we're going to need to come in here
01:04:27 like soon or like one of these days
01:04:29 we're going to be in here. And one time he said,
01:04:31 yeah, we're going to need to work in here.
01:04:33 He said, uh, next week,
01:04:35 he said, next week we're going to be in here
01:04:37 to work on this room. And I said,
01:04:39 okay. And then
01:04:41 the next like, like the next day
01:04:43 a guy came and he was like, hey, we need to work
01:04:45 in here. And I'm like, the other guy said
01:04:47 next week. And he was like,
01:04:49 yeah, okay. And then he left.
01:04:51 And I was like, all right.
01:04:53 And then the next day, my landlord came
01:04:55 and knocked on my door and was like,
01:04:57 Ben, you know, when these guys need to
01:04:59 work in your room, you know, we need to
01:05:01 we need to, you need to be letting these guys
01:05:03 work in their room. And then she did, she did
01:05:05 the stupid thing she does where she, she like tries
01:05:07 to deflect and like she tries to
01:05:09 she tries to get her way by
01:05:11 using sympathy for other people. She says,
01:05:13 you know, I feel bad for these guys. They're just
01:05:15 trying to do their jobs. I feel bad for these
01:05:17 guys. They're just trying to do their jobs in here.
01:05:19 And they just, they need to, and I'm like, okay,
01:05:21 okay, okay, okay. And, and
01:05:23 I don't know. So I just
01:05:25 so she, she told me like tomorrow,
01:05:27 she told me like tomorrow, these guys are going to come in here
01:05:29 and I'm like, fine, like, yeah, fine.
01:05:31 It just, I just want to know in advance.
01:05:33 But so she told me, okay.
01:05:35 And then so
01:05:37 she said, like, keep this wall clear so
01:05:39 they can work on this side of the room. And I said, okay.
01:05:41 So then I cleared a bunch of
01:05:43 stuff and I moved stuff so the wall is clear.
01:05:45 And then the next day,
01:05:47 nobody came and nobody did anything
01:05:49 in my room. So
01:05:51 I don't know. You scared
01:05:53 you was, you were too powerful. I didn't do it.
01:05:55 Those, those poor little builders,
01:05:57 they, they were
01:05:59 intimidated by the big mean Ben St.
01:06:01 saying, okay, I was
01:06:03 ready though. Okay. I was ready
01:06:05 because I'm like, all right, well
01:06:07 if these guys are going to be in here and they're going to work in my room, that means
01:06:09 I can't do anything. So I'm going to take this
01:06:11 opportunity to go to the post
01:06:13 office and mail a bunch of packages I've been meaning to
01:06:15 mail.
01:06:17 So I packed up my bag and I'm like, I got
01:06:19 my bag ready as soon as they come and they're like, hey,
01:06:21 we got to work in here. I'm going to be like, okay.
01:06:23 And then I'm going to get on the bus and I'm going to go to the post
01:06:25 office and maybe by the time I get back, they'll be done.
01:06:27 And won't that be cool.
01:06:29 And then they didn't do it.
01:06:31 So like, I mean,
01:06:33 I got my bag still packed here.
01:06:35 It's got bottles of slime and stuff in it.
01:06:37 Undelivered road to rad
01:06:39 cons and stuff like that.
01:06:41 So I'm just
01:06:43 maybe, maybe tomorrow
01:06:45 they'll do that. And then I'll
01:06:47 go to the post office when they come
01:06:49 and work on my, they got to install.
01:06:51 Apparently they're installing, they're taking
01:06:53 out like steam radiators and they're
01:06:55 installing like,
01:06:57 you know, like the heaters that are like
01:06:59 a strip of metal across like the
01:07:01 bottom of the
01:07:03 corner of the wall. You know what I mean?
01:07:05 Yeah, they're installing some shit
01:07:07 like that.
01:07:09 They're updating the discussing
01:07:11 old-fashioned radiators that we got
01:07:13 in here. That's what they're doing.
01:07:15 Which is fine.
01:07:17 My stupid idiot
01:07:19 roommate who I hate
01:07:21 who sucks in his bad
01:07:23 and he asked me for money
01:07:25 for no
01:07:27 sensible reason.
01:07:29 So I'll never forgive him for that.
01:07:31 He walked by
01:07:33 and I think I've mentioned that adjacent
01:07:35 to my room is another room that has no windows.
01:07:37 It's like a horrible little
01:07:39 little cave.
01:07:41 Yeah, I've seen it.
01:07:43 Oh, that's right. Oh, that's right. Yeah, you were here.
01:07:45 Yeah.
01:07:47 So I don't go in there
01:07:49 but like this idiot
01:07:51 like I'm in the kitchen
01:07:53 and he walks through the kitchen and he's like
01:07:55 something
01:07:57 mumbles something and I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:07:59 And he looks in that cave
01:08:01 and he sees the
01:08:03 like they put in the fucking
01:08:05 they put the fucking new radiator in
01:08:07 and he's like, oh, that's a big improvement.
01:08:09 That looks like a really big improvement.
01:08:11 And of course I just
01:08:13 I hate this guy and I want to leave me alone
01:08:15 and I nod and I go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:08:17 On the inside, I'm like, you fucking
01:08:19 you mongrel, you've fucking
01:08:21 you what is wrong with you?
01:08:23 How could you look at this room
01:08:25 and say, oh, yeah, it looks good. Oh, yeah, big improvement.
01:08:27 No, you freak.
01:08:31 Trying so hard to make small
01:08:33 I hate
01:08:35 all I could think of was like, that is a radiator
01:08:37 in here and that's something
01:08:39 this is the guy I've probably
01:08:41 complained about it before. This is the guy who said
01:08:43 that one of
01:08:45 a guy who used to live here wants us
01:08:47 to send him money
01:08:49 to pay for utilities
01:08:51 like suppose like he said, oh, yeah, the guys
01:08:53 he's still paying the utility bill for this place
01:08:55 even though he doesn't live here. So like
01:08:57 can I have some money to like send to him
01:08:59 and I pulled out my gun and I shot
01:09:01 him. I shot him six.
01:09:03 So I pulled out a knife and I said, don't be scared.
01:09:05 Just a little kitty cat and I jumped on him and stabbed him
01:09:07 in the liver.
01:09:09 And then he shot him four times
01:09:11 through the eye.
01:09:13 Well, twice. It made four
01:09:15 entrance wounds and exit wounds.
01:09:17 Yeah, so two
01:09:19 Yeah, so two clean shots
01:09:21 in the eye, two shots in the eye
01:09:23 and it was clean kill, clean kill
01:09:25 or so I thought, but then he
01:09:27 but then he came back and he started
01:09:29 and he wandered around the place like a zombie
01:09:31 and he said, oh, hey, Ben
01:09:33 where's that bow that where that bow and arrow
01:09:35 you have before like where'd you get that bow and
01:09:37 arrow?
01:09:39 That's it.
01:09:41 That part was so odd like
01:09:43 to conflate a projectile
01:09:45 weapon with a bow and arrow
01:09:47 instead of a gun, which is so much more
01:09:49 common. Yeah, you would think be having.
01:09:51 Yeah, you would think and apparently
01:09:53 the guy like he owned guns
01:09:55 like this is not a guy who was like he owned
01:09:57 his own guns and yet
01:09:59 in trying to recall what happened
01:10:01 he mentions
01:10:03 Yeah, he mentions he mentions bow and
01:10:05 arrow before he mentions a gun.
01:10:07 He forgets what a gun is
01:10:09 like it's pretty interesting how the brain
01:10:11 works if you've got like a storage
01:10:13 thing of like, OK, so what should
01:10:15 stuff projectile weapons
01:10:17 and you've got a list and it starts
01:10:19 with bow and arrow and he just picks that
01:10:21 very counterintuitive. I like you have
01:10:23 like we in the modern day have such a
01:10:25 more visceral like
01:10:27 fucking experience
01:10:29 with guns.
01:10:31 I feel like
01:10:33 if your brain were like
01:10:35 randomly trying to pull
01:10:37 firing neurons and you were trying to
01:10:39 pull the concept of a projectile
01:10:41 weapon, you would more naturally
01:10:43 call something else a gun
01:10:45 than you would call a gun
01:10:47 some fucking weird shit
01:10:49 like a bow and arrow. Maybe
01:10:51 you was thinking alphabetically.
01:10:53 That's probably it.
01:10:59 Anyway, fucking
01:11:01 can't wait to send
01:11:03 cannot wait to send these packages. Some
01:11:05 of them I have owed people for months
01:11:07 and months and I'm sorry
01:11:11 I'm sorry
01:11:13 I'm sorry I
01:11:15 I'm almost
01:11:17 I'm almost done with the fucking
01:11:19 putting the files
01:11:21 together for this slime and punishment
01:11:23 book. The lady
01:11:25 the Alibaba lady is so
01:11:27 unhelpful. She takes
01:11:29 like
01:11:31 a day or more to get back to me
01:11:33 about very simple requests
01:11:35 for very obvious information
01:11:37 that I ought to have
01:11:39 and she sent me the wrong
01:11:41 template.
01:11:43 I asked for the page template
01:11:45 to set the pages up and she sent me
01:11:47 the correct page templates
01:11:49 but the wrong cover template
01:11:51 she sent me the template for a hard cover
01:11:53 even though it's a soft cover book. So I had
01:11:55 to ask her two days ago I sent her like
01:11:57 hey could you send me the right template so I can actually
01:11:59 finish making this thing and she hasn't gotten back
01:12:01 to me yet. So
01:12:03 that's not helping.
01:12:07 I'm
01:12:09 trying to make it clear to her that I'm almost
01:12:11 done. I'm almost ready to send your
01:12:13 company some money. So
01:12:15 if you could please help me
01:12:17 get there with it.
01:12:19 I used Alibaba
01:12:21 for the Lord of Ghost pins
01:12:23 and I think
01:12:25 just because there's so many
01:12:27 competing companies
01:12:29 of that type in China
01:12:31 that they probably
01:12:33 skimp on like
01:12:35 costs wherever they can. So like
01:12:37 the translation I'm assuming
01:12:39 is not like the best.
01:12:41 It takes a while for them to really
01:12:43 understand what I'm asking for them.
01:12:45 I don't know if that's the case.
01:12:47 This lady doesn't seem to have any
01:12:49 trouble like speaking or understanding
01:12:51 English. But I don't know.
01:12:53 She could be
01:12:55 having to consult
01:12:57 with an English speaking co-worker
01:12:59 between responses
01:13:01 to me. I don't know
01:13:03 it's possible.
01:13:05 It's going to be
01:13:07 different but at least for
01:13:09 pins. There was like so many
01:13:11 companies that make pins and they were all
01:13:15 yelling in broken English
01:13:17 giving me like I put my
01:13:19 thing up like I need
01:13:21 enamel pins of this size of this amount
01:13:23 and you get like
01:13:25 messages from everyone who's selling
01:13:27 that saying choose us choose us. Here's what
01:13:29 we have. You can do that.
01:13:31 You can like post a request for like
01:13:33 here's what I need made.
01:13:35 Yeah. Instead of
01:13:37 being the seller
01:13:39 of something you can
01:13:41 say I'm looking for this type of thing
01:13:43 and then you'd get DMs
01:13:45 from people selling that type of thing saying
01:13:47 choose me choose me. Huh.
01:13:49 That's what I did for the thing.
01:13:51 I didn't really know how I was supposed to do it
01:13:53 so that worked. I just
01:13:55 like I just like
01:13:57 I browsed products and I
01:13:59 found like companies
01:14:01 that were selling products similar to what I was
01:14:03 looking for and I would just I would just send
01:14:05 messages to them being like here's what I need
01:14:07 can you do it.
01:14:09 It's interesting.
01:14:11 Did you use you
01:14:13 didn't use the company that I used for
01:14:15 the DMs from them did you.
01:14:17 I don't think so.
01:14:19 I just I don't
01:14:21 remember asking you exactly what company
01:14:23 it was. Right.
01:14:25 I just found something
01:14:27 that was like it seems like good quality
01:14:29 cheap.
01:14:31 Like professional enough to be like
01:14:33 I could I could probably trust that they would
01:14:35 do it. They did actually get them very
01:14:37 quick to me which is nice.
01:14:39 That's not it took me I mean well
01:14:41 I mean when I did the rfck one I had to do
01:14:43 like they had like 20 different designs that I had
01:14:45 to yeah that would have been
01:14:47 a lot more different yeah
01:14:49 it took forever
01:14:51 hmm
01:14:53 what are we talking about. Oh
01:14:55 slime punishment templates yeah it's
01:14:57 pretty it's pretty close to being I've been drawing
01:14:59 the cover.
01:15:01 I've been drawing
01:15:03 me let me you know what
01:15:05 I'm sort of I'm sort of going
01:15:07 back and forth on what I think the cover is
01:15:09 going to look like but here's sort of
01:15:11 like this is kind of halfway
01:15:13 to being done
01:15:15 and like it's probably going to look something
01:15:17 like this I'm probably going to redraw a bunch
01:15:19 of it but like I think it's
01:15:21 kind of I think it's
01:15:23 alright I think it's getting there
01:15:27 I'm actually not sure about nightstar in
01:15:29 the background I don't know if we if it really
01:15:31 needs her
01:15:33 I think nightstar's
01:15:35 positioning is a bit weird yeah
01:15:37 yeah she's covered
01:15:39 yeah yeah yeah she's kind of obscured
01:15:41 in this it's you know what it is
01:15:43 it's because I put her in the I put her
01:15:45 in the sky and then I kind of
01:15:47 like moved phantom around
01:15:49 and then I added the buildings at the bottom
01:15:51 as kind of like a later
01:15:53 addition so yeah the
01:15:55 positioning does not account for any
01:15:57 of that so yeah this is not
01:15:59 also she would
01:16:01 probably have a different sort of like filter
01:16:03 effect on her
01:16:05 this is not final
01:16:07 this is not final yes yes
01:16:09 understood anyway but I've been
01:16:11 this is
01:16:13 one of the last things I need to get done is just finish
01:16:15 this
01:16:17 slime and or punishment please
01:16:19 yes yes right away
01:16:21 wishes my command
01:16:25 instead of trick or treating
01:16:27 you say slime or punishment
01:16:29 I ordered
01:16:31 I'm hoping it won't be some annoying
01:16:33 shit where like I order it
01:16:35 and then they're like okay I will send you the proof
01:16:37 copies and then
01:16:39 like I move in between
01:16:41 when they send it
01:16:43 like I'm hoping it gets here before I move
01:16:45 so they don't have to like
01:16:47 worry about it coming to the wrong address or anything
01:16:49 like that
01:16:51 could you do you not have the
01:16:53 p.o. box anymore I do not
01:16:55 no the old my old p.o. box expired
01:16:57 which is why a bunch
01:16:59 of a
01:17:01 a couple of not probably not that many but a
01:17:03 few of my
01:17:05 a road to red con and pleading with blue rays
01:17:07 might have ended up lost in the mail because
01:17:09 if I got any returns
01:17:11 past like February they would have had nowhere to go
01:17:13 because my p.o. box was expired
01:17:15 but
01:17:17 yeah I need I need to make a new one
01:17:19 but I haven't I haven't made a new one yet
01:17:23 also I'm not even
01:17:25 sure
01:17:27 they would send it in a box and I'm not sure you could send
01:17:29 a
01:17:31 you could it wouldn't fit in the p.o. box
01:17:33 but they would probably just keep it there and like put
01:17:35 a slip in the box and then you could
01:17:37 go and like pick up the slip and they would
01:17:39 find the package in a in the back room
01:17:41 or something I think that's how it works
01:17:43 yeah getting a new p.o. box
01:17:45 is just one of those things that I've needed
01:17:47 to do for a while and I haven't gotten around to it
01:17:49 oops
01:17:51 whoopsie
01:17:53 my gosh Ben is you should maybe should do
01:17:55 that for when I go
01:17:57 to the post office when they
01:17:59 finally get around
01:18:01 to doing some work in my room
01:18:03 whoa
01:18:05 what I think that was me
01:18:07 you mentioned you I heard
01:18:09 talking about sign punishment and it reminded
01:18:11 me of like an extra topic I'd forgotten about
01:18:13 oh you finished but I do want to bring
01:18:15 something cool up because I just type
01:18:17 something in and I'm getting crazy cool images
01:18:19 that you might like uh no I think I was
01:18:21 I'm pretty much done with what I had to
01:18:23 say about that
01:18:25 okay
01:18:27 surprise topic I just remembered I've been fucking
01:18:29 around with an AI
01:18:31 that recently became publicly available
01:18:33 called mid journey
01:18:35 yeah
01:18:37 I just put an image in chat of something I just
01:18:39 generated with it
01:18:41 you know inspired
01:18:43 by the rfck
01:18:45 colors
01:18:47 wait what did you put in
01:18:49 what did you type
01:18:51 well at first I typed
01:18:53 slime and punishment but the
01:18:55 result
01:18:57 so I'll post that result
01:18:59 that result didn't have the right color scheme
01:19:01 that looks awesome holy fuck
01:19:03 so when I'm like I need the right color
01:19:05 so I said green slime
01:19:07 and purple punishment
01:19:09 over slime city cathedral
01:19:11 and then I got the
01:19:13 first result there
01:19:15 these mid journeys
01:19:17 this is
01:19:19 it's just free you just do it
01:19:21 um it's the first
01:19:23 I think the first 20 are free
01:19:25 and then you have to pay
01:19:27 $10 a month and then you get like 200
01:19:29 I gave an ever prompt
01:19:31 a week ago this
01:19:33 I wonder if you could guess what the prompt for this
01:19:35 image is wait a minute this is
01:19:37 patreon.com
01:19:39 you're on the right track because of the
01:19:41 orange that's what I thought I was gonna say
01:19:43 it looks like um
01:19:45 uh oh god what's that
01:19:47 fucking video game
01:19:49 about space bloodborne oh
01:19:51 I don't know
01:19:53 could be a lot
01:19:55 the one about the procedurally generated
01:19:57 planets
01:19:59 out of worlds
01:20:01 no that's not procedurally generated
01:20:03 I don't know oh no man's sky
01:20:05 yeah
01:20:07 is it no man's sky something
01:20:09 uh no the prompt is
01:20:11 would you trust ben saint
01:20:15 so I was right
01:20:17 that is what they think ben saint is
01:20:19 because you're a saint
01:20:21 it gave him a halo because he's a saint
01:20:23 I guess
01:20:25 wait is it
01:20:27 is it orange because of my association with patreon
01:20:29 is that somehow
01:20:31 like a factor again
01:20:33 I have to assume
01:20:35 that halo looks
01:20:37 so
01:20:39 it kind of does look like the old patreon logo
01:20:41 honestly
01:20:43 it does kind of
01:20:45 what I've noticed from the journey
01:20:47 it can't be
01:20:49 gotta be coincidence
01:20:51 it is an exceptionally
01:20:53 exceptionally good
01:20:55 ideas machine more than anything else
01:20:57 because the results are always
01:20:59 going to be a bit funky they're always going to be a bit weird looking
01:21:03 but there's just some really cool stuff
01:21:05 I think
01:21:07 I was talking with four eyes
01:21:09 maybe a few nights ago
01:21:11 and he suggested
01:21:13 why don't you type in earth bound
01:21:15 these
01:21:17 I'm like
01:21:19 oh yeah
01:21:21 let's see how that goes
01:21:23 let me post
01:21:25 those results they were all very different
01:21:27 I actually
01:21:29 have the AI upscaled them because all four of them
01:21:31 looked so fucking cool
01:21:35 I'm just checking posting in the right order
01:21:37 these four images
01:21:39 that are loading
01:21:41 and there they are
01:21:43 it's just really cool
01:21:45 shit
01:21:47 let me see here
01:21:49 this is concept art for video game
01:21:51 this is like really really good
01:21:53 yeah quality
01:21:55 say goodbye
01:21:57 artists of human
01:21:59 yeah fuck artists
01:22:01 I knew we'd get rid of them one of these days
01:22:05 no
01:22:07 this is just another tool that artists can use
01:22:09 to like help them
01:22:11 think of more
01:22:13 ways to tackle their ideas
01:22:15 that's what they told
01:22:17 John Henry
01:22:19 about the train
01:22:21 train track laying machine
01:22:23 and he died
01:22:25 you ran over by a train
01:22:27 head crushed by a train
01:22:29 that's the guy
01:22:31 that died
01:22:33 to prove that he was a better railroad worker
01:22:35 than the machine
01:22:37 like he would lay track real quick
01:22:39 something like that
01:22:41 right?
01:22:43 he wanted to prove it
01:22:45 his big brain
01:22:47 could lay on a track and when a train ran over
01:22:49 his skull the train would be destroyed
01:22:51 and he would lay it off
01:22:53 I swear this is not
01:22:55 this is a real
01:22:57 well it's not a real thing to happen
01:22:59 possibly I mean
01:23:01 I don't have enough
01:23:03 I'm not getting enough information
01:23:05 it was a great victory for the proletariat
01:23:07 labor one
01:23:09 so there
01:23:11 the second one you posted is
01:23:13 like berserk
01:23:15 the what's it called
01:23:17 when
01:23:19 Griffith uses the behelit for the first time
01:23:21 the eclipse
01:23:23 that's like eclipse core
01:23:25 like writhing
01:23:27 massive flesh as the ground
01:23:29 and like towering things
01:23:31 it's like what
01:23:33 I wonder if this can do cute stuff
01:23:35 I feel like this is like a
01:23:37 like a vibe
01:23:39 that this is good at
01:23:41 but it couldn't like create a give and take image
01:23:43 I don't think
01:23:45 that's a great question
01:23:47 yeah maybe not
01:23:49 say goodbye ai you suck
01:23:51 you can't make my job
01:23:53 defunct
01:23:55 well I asked it to generate minions once
01:23:57 and it was really terrifying to be honest
01:23:59 ask it to do a realistic pokemon in real life
01:24:01 yes please
01:24:03 there's some more
01:24:05 rfck looking
01:24:07 rfck looking one like the bottom right quite a bit
01:24:09 just for slime
01:24:11 all over the cathedral there
01:24:13 I am
01:24:15 good stuff
01:24:17 I'm hastily photo editing
01:24:19 this one of me
01:24:21 because I like it
01:24:23 alright I can probably do better
01:24:25 probably do better than this later
01:24:27 this will do for now
01:24:29 this is going to be my new discord
01:24:31 avatar
01:24:33 hell yeah
01:24:35 hell yeah
01:24:37 I'll leave you with a funny one
01:24:39 to round that off so this is
01:24:41 great yellow minions devour the holy spirit
01:24:43 of the united states
01:24:45 oh I'm looking at some of these other ones
01:24:47 you posted previously
01:24:49 some of these are very hollow knight
01:24:51 like the big white skulls
01:24:53 with the holes in them
01:24:55 oh yeah maybe
01:24:57 those are all results from the earthbound
01:24:59 gigas
01:25:01 those ones
01:25:03 minions
01:25:05 what's going on
01:25:07 what's going on with these
01:25:09 I like the sort of weird smoke
01:25:11 in the first one
01:25:13 I don't know it's like
01:25:15 radiating off of this one-eyed
01:25:17 american shield
01:25:19 minion
01:25:21 captain america
01:25:23 yeah I think these are
01:25:25 definitely a vibe going on here
01:25:27 and I'm thinking that maybe this
01:25:29 program has sort of a
01:25:31 bias towards
01:25:33 painted
01:25:35 yeah it's a bias towards
01:25:37 like painterly surrealist heart
01:25:39 seems to be it's
01:25:41 you couldn't make
01:25:43 although I am curious
01:25:45 like if I typed in briska
01:25:47 what would it do
01:25:49 yeah
01:25:51 I could type in briska
01:25:53 briska circuit relaxing
01:25:55 after a long day of
01:25:57 being my girlfriend
01:25:59 that's a good one
01:26:01 you should make
01:26:03 you should make a visual novel called that
01:26:05 that's just briska like sitting in a hammock
01:26:07 and you just talk to her
01:26:09 explain like hi honey
01:26:11 how was being my girlfriend today
01:26:13 oh it was wonderful
01:26:19 I have to wonder
01:26:21 if the word
01:26:23 girlfriend is banned or not
01:26:25 they ban a lot of NSFW words
01:26:27 or anything suggestive
01:26:29 degeneracy
01:26:31 we can't let our children be exposed to
01:26:33 it says it's running
01:26:35 it says it's running we'll see
01:26:37 what happens with it
01:26:39 this is fucking elden ring them snakes
01:26:41 the roots of the heirs tree
01:26:43 the root of all snakes
01:26:45 the root of all snakes
01:26:47 it's true
01:26:49 these rfck ones I'm posting
01:26:51 in the community service
01:26:53 I can upscale any of them
01:26:55 this last one
01:26:57 please do
01:26:59 this last one of the two cathedrals
01:27:01 next to each other
01:27:03 the two cathedrals bottom right
01:27:05 right
01:27:07 that one on the right
01:27:09 I'll upscale that one for you
01:27:11 these rule
01:27:13 can you upscale the first
01:27:15 one too
01:27:17 I love all eight of these
01:27:19 I can upscale all eight of them
01:27:21 I'll do it
01:27:23 that would make me really happy
01:27:25 the top right in that second
01:27:27 thing the green one
01:27:29 reminds me a lot of
01:27:31 new lando ruins
01:27:33 in Dark Souls 1
01:27:35 I don't know why because it's blue in that game
01:27:37 but it just sort of feels like this is the underneath
01:27:39 this is like a secret
01:27:41 extra cathedral in the sewers
01:27:43 under
01:27:45 and Wacacom
01:27:47 proper
01:27:49 these are like
01:27:51 maybe it's the
01:27:53 you know as we know
01:27:55 from slime and punishment
01:27:57 the
01:27:59 the de-slimed alpha city was crushed
01:28:01 underneath
01:28:03 the re-slimifying beta
01:28:05 time line version
01:28:07 maybe these are the ruins
01:28:09 underneath of the old alpha city
01:28:11 where the slime from above
01:28:13 went back down
01:28:15 into it
01:28:17 it's Frisca there she is
01:28:19 she's got so many legs
01:28:21 she does
01:28:23 but does she have eight
01:28:25 wait wait
01:28:27 I gotta see this
01:28:29 I gotta tell the guys
01:28:31 wait a minute
01:28:33 okay
01:28:35 like obviously when you google frisca circuit
01:28:37 it would come up with different types of images
01:28:39 so this is like more bright
01:28:41 colorful I like that the color
01:28:43 is correct
01:28:45 with the orange
01:28:47 I can tell where
01:28:49 the source of things this would pull from
01:28:51 these are so
01:28:53 these are so weird and uncanny
01:28:55 yeah
01:28:57 AI is still a little difficult
01:28:59 it's difficult for an AI to like
01:29:01 figure out how to make a cartoon character
01:29:03 the multiple different artists draw
01:29:05 this thing cannot construct
01:29:07 a body
01:29:09 yeah
01:29:11 this thing can do
01:29:13 like organic shapes
01:29:15 and like symmetrical
01:29:17 creatures and it can do like
01:29:19 abstract sort of like
01:29:21 distance shots
01:29:23 scenery sort of
01:29:25 atmospheric
01:29:27 this is
01:29:29 did you
01:29:31 include the colors is it
01:29:33 like it knew the colors
01:29:35 frisca
01:29:37 it found complementary colors on its own
01:29:39 yeah
01:29:41 like again the text
01:29:43 to put above that one is exactly what I typed in
01:29:45 like you can type in like super vague shit
01:29:47 like scariest thing ever
01:29:49 and you'll like see really like creepy shit
01:29:51 and it'll just come up with stuff
01:29:53 it's just
01:29:55 this face
01:29:57 on the bottom right one
01:29:59 it's the one horn
01:30:01 smug grin
01:30:03 yeah the one macaroni horn
01:30:05 wait wait wait
01:30:07 shit how do we get to this thing
01:30:09 it's called mid journey
01:30:11 it runs on discord
01:30:13 there's actually a discord server
01:30:15 so you have to like
01:30:17 go to your website sign up
01:30:19 and then you can join your discord server
01:30:21 and the server has like a hundred channels
01:30:23 that are getting used by like a hundred people
01:30:25 each constantly
01:30:27 and it's a real cluster fuck
01:30:29 and it's hard to like find your images
01:30:31 because I get drowned out by everyone else's
01:30:33 you can like
01:30:35 if you pay them
01:30:37 like ten dollars a month
01:30:39 which is what I decided to do because I just have a lot of fun with it
01:30:41 you can
01:30:43 interact with their bot via discord dms
01:30:45 which is what I'm doing right now
01:30:47 yeah that sounds like a lot
01:30:49 more
01:30:51 less annoying than
01:30:53 the thing I'm being bombarded with
01:30:55 plus there is an arbitrary limit
01:30:57 which is nice to know
01:30:59 you know what
01:31:01 I do like
01:31:03 AI
01:31:05 like image creation
01:31:07 but I feel like on discord
01:31:09 I don't want to be on discord
01:31:11 I want to leave
01:31:13 leave server
01:31:15 I want to leave yeah same
01:31:17 why did you leave
01:31:19 server just don't
01:31:21 just leave me alone
01:31:23 go on
01:31:25 I can't stand
01:31:27 because there's no
01:31:29 it's never clear where you're supposed to go
01:31:31 you left my server
01:31:33 you traitor
01:31:35 you left me to die
01:31:37 I left your server because
01:31:39 it pulls me into like
01:31:41 annoying arguments
01:31:43 hell yeah
01:31:45 and like petty bullshit about tricksy
01:31:47 and I'm like you know what
01:31:49 I'd rather just never hear about anything
01:31:51 and it's great
01:31:53 I like to gossip
01:31:55 it's not even just you
01:31:57 it's just like the atmosphere there
01:31:59 that's the thing people do now
01:32:01 I like people in there
01:32:03 so it's not like a personal thing
01:32:05 I don't like that I keep checking
01:32:07 the server
01:32:09 because I get so upset sometimes
01:32:11 it's not good for me
01:32:13 I get it
01:32:15 some people in there like to just come in here
01:32:17 with like hey here's some really annoying
01:32:19 here's some really infuriating shit
01:32:21 that I saw
01:32:23 it's fine I understand
01:32:25 hang on
01:32:27 I'm applying more color filters
01:32:29 this cool portrait of me
01:32:31 that's my
01:32:33 I could like
01:32:35 try to have the AI just generate one
01:32:37 like dark robed
01:32:39 man with the power
01:32:41 of slime green halo
01:32:43 purple sky sort of thing
01:32:45 it could like come up with something like that
01:32:47 I mean
01:32:49 don't let me stop
01:32:51 I'll send it to you
01:32:53 and DMs when I do
01:32:55 it's taking a while to upscale all 8 of these
01:32:57 things from earlier
01:32:59 I guess
01:33:01 I'll just
01:33:03 I can bring up the last thing I want to mention
01:33:05 which is a YouTube channel that I
01:33:07 remembered exists
01:33:09 because
01:33:11 working on more
01:33:13 it's called Hippocrates
01:33:15 my favorite
01:33:17 this is a more obscure
01:33:19 less or known channel that
01:33:21 me and my friends stumbled across
01:33:23 on fucking new years
01:33:25 going from 2018 to 2019
01:33:27 we were all playing Minecraft
01:33:29 because I'm now sampling
01:33:31 older Minecraft recordings
01:33:33 for son of a glitch
01:33:35 and oh my god so
01:33:37 there's this channel
01:33:39 I don't remember which one of us found it
01:33:41 I haven't watched the recording in detail
01:33:43 because it's like five hours long but
01:33:45 we just found this YouTube channel that just has
01:33:47 a very specific fixation
01:33:53 I kind of like don't even know
01:33:55 like where to begin with this shit
01:33:57 so I'm just gonna
01:33:59 post images
01:34:01 of YouTube thumbnails that they
01:34:03 have
01:34:05 when Jason was
01:34:07 at the table I kept on seeing him look up at me
01:34:09 while he was
01:34:11 with that older girl
01:34:13 what
01:34:15 huh
01:34:17 giant pooping fox
01:34:19 three dimensional dogs
01:34:21 what's inside a dog's butthole
01:34:23 an educational
01:34:25 Minecraft video for kids
01:34:27 what the fuck hang on
01:34:29 in this kid friendly swear free video
01:34:31 I tell you and your kids what's inside a
01:34:33 dog's rectum
01:34:35 this video is fun for the whole family
01:34:37 oh
01:34:39 Steve from Minecraft
01:34:41 has a really nice house
01:34:43 uh oh
01:34:45 I don't like
01:34:47 I mean I can just from the context that
01:34:49 thumbnail is placed in
01:34:51 Minecraft fox buttholes texture
01:34:53 back
01:34:55 wow
01:34:57 fox
01:34:59 for oral anal unbirth
01:35:01 cock nasal
01:35:03 oh this one's got a lot of views
01:35:05 yeah
01:35:07 so this channel
01:35:09 somehow still exists somehow
01:35:11 being like destroyed for
01:35:13 some kind of violation but um
01:35:15 this is making me do the
01:35:17 the fucking um
01:35:19 Matthew McConaughey looking
01:35:21 at his phone while he
01:35:23 takes a drag on his cigarette with
01:35:25 a deranged look in his eye
01:35:27 face
01:35:29 so this person likes the inside
01:35:31 of canine buttholes
01:35:33 and he wants to live in one
01:35:35 uh presumably
01:35:37 and he put his Minecraft
01:35:39 skills to
01:35:41 to the test and built
01:35:43 I'm assuming a giant fox that he
01:35:45 can crawl inside and pretend he was
01:35:47 bored in Minecraft
01:35:49 and then come out the butthole
01:35:51 he's also a video game developer
01:35:53 hmm
01:35:55 and he's developing a video game we go inside
01:35:57 of dogs butthole
01:35:59 cool epic for game
01:36:01 um
01:36:03 so back on that new years
01:36:05 nearly you know
01:36:07 I convinced made to
01:36:09 download his game and play it
01:36:11 and it's an absolute fucking
01:36:13 it's an absolute clusterfuck
01:36:15 it's like an RPG maker style
01:36:17 game where you're a fox and you walk around
01:36:19 and it's like haha you found
01:36:21 rabbits xd lol
01:36:23 xd epic rabbits haha
01:36:25 put in inventory
01:36:27 and the inventory is your butthole
01:36:29 and so it's like you have 11 rabbits
01:36:31 in your inventory your inventory is full
01:36:33 will you poop one out to make room
01:36:35 is this by this is by the same guy right
01:36:37 this is by the same guy
01:36:39 and like the entire game all of the menus
01:36:41 and everything is hot little epic random
01:36:43 xd like it's all
01:36:45 so I was right yeah put rabbits in
01:36:47 your butthole yeah rabbits down your hole
01:36:49 exactly and we were
01:36:51 just like looking at this guy's fucking
01:36:53 channel and then made like played his video
01:36:55 game we were just fucking screaming
01:36:57 we were screaming
01:36:59 while he was playing it
01:37:01 um
01:37:03 fucking
01:37:05 epic random
01:37:07 lol cool epic
01:37:09 like that's like a
01:37:11 that's like um

01:37:43 like
01:37:45 I can has cheeseburger that means

01:37:49 this is a case this is what it what it means
01:37:51 to be a fox that is you talk like
01:37:53 you're from the early 2000s on a
01:37:55 forum here's here's what I think I think
01:37:57 this is an I think this is an adult
01:37:59 with this kind of arrested within
01:38:01 with an arrested development who is
01:38:03 talking in the way that he
01:38:05 maybe feels like a child
01:38:07 or a or a younger
01:38:09 person talks I think
01:38:11 he's doing it as sort of a like an
01:38:13 affect like a cute affect
01:38:15 just maybe for fun
01:38:17 so and but to him that's like oh yeah

01:40:09 what we're talking about it
01:40:11 ooh where do you
01:40:13 spiders come from yeah so
01:40:15 above the avatar of the spiders that stuff
01:40:17 I generated for my friend
01:40:19 iracubus she
01:40:21 is a vtuber friend of mine
01:40:23 who's cool yes a vtuber
01:40:25 ben you've met your match
01:40:27 um yeah
01:40:29 that's the thing the thing about me
01:40:31 is that those make me angry
01:40:33 it's
01:40:35 not yeah it's not true
01:40:37 this is a false
01:40:39 allegation against me I beat the charges
01:40:41 I just
01:40:43 wanted to make cool a spidery imagery
01:40:45 and these look
01:40:47 I
01:40:49 some honestly
01:40:51 some of these do feel like okay well
01:40:53 there's a certain kind of artist that is just
01:40:55 out of work now
01:40:57 yes yeah
01:40:59 Tony spent
01:41:01 yeah these do look
01:41:03 which ones I can't
01:41:05 I can't choose though the one with the
01:41:07 middle middle right
01:41:09 with the crown
01:41:11 rules oh yeah that's
01:41:13 a good one yeah the two the two
01:41:15 drawn to the to the bottom
01:41:17 middle right
01:41:19 just because of the
01:41:21 napkin that's bleeding pink into it
01:41:23 with the eyes
01:41:27 I feel like any one of these
01:41:29 that's like blown up it's like a vinyl
01:41:31 record album cover it'll be like oh
01:41:33 that's so fucking sick I wonder what
01:41:35 it is I'm gonna buy it the one the one
01:41:37 listen to it the one just to the left
01:41:39 of that one that it looks sort of like a
01:41:41 dead spider like set inside of like a
01:41:43 diamond and there's like human
01:41:45 blonde human hair flowing
01:41:47 down I have it oh my oh man
01:41:49 oh man
01:41:51 these are so good
01:41:53 give me
01:41:55 give me a break
01:41:57 okay
01:41:59 this is a yeah
01:42:01 for a certain genre of image this
01:42:03 AI really
01:42:05 he's really it's really
01:42:07 it's really delivering yeah
01:42:09 I guess like ten bucks a month there's
01:42:11 not that much if you needed to like a
01:42:13 commission an artist to make a thing
01:42:15 like like this take
01:42:17 time it would not take
01:42:19 like five minutes and it would take
01:42:21 more than ten dollars the thing to notice
01:42:23 about this is right now the upscaling
01:42:25 isn't great
01:42:27 for example I can
01:42:29 put a few of these so like in that collage
01:42:31 of all the spider imagery the top left you have the
01:42:33 the woman's face with like the
01:42:35 the crown floating above it
01:42:37 and there's like spider webs linking everything
01:42:39 together when you scale it all the
01:42:41 all the like the thin spider waves disappear
01:42:43 like the AI just like forgets what
01:42:45 they are and doesn't know what to do
01:42:47 with them you know yeah I'm opening
01:42:49 it in a different tab I'm zooming
01:42:51 in the
01:42:53 the closer you get to it the less impressive
01:42:55 it seems yeah
01:42:57 yeah
01:42:59 that makes sense still nice still
01:43:01 still good like for inspiration
01:43:03 it's very good for like inspiration
01:43:05 and it will
01:43:07 get better
01:43:09 which is better
01:43:11 or worse for us maybe I feel like
01:43:13 overall I mean for me
01:43:15 I'm always going to be drawing like bad
01:43:17 like comparatively
01:43:19 like my art style is like silly and goofy
01:43:21 and cute but I don't feel like
01:43:23 AI
01:43:25 is like it's like an industry
01:43:27 forwarded by people who
01:43:29 like that thing they want to make
01:43:31 the most realistic
01:43:33 this is what they're probably driving for
01:43:35 generally it's like
01:43:37 can we recreate a perfectly
01:43:39 human person
01:43:41 just with a computer in 2 seconds
01:43:43 they're not really wondering
01:43:45 whether we can draw like a stick figure
01:43:47 in the same time because it's easier
01:43:49 so I'll be alright
01:43:51 yeah I'll be alright because
01:43:53 every one of these AI things
01:43:55 across the board has like
01:43:57 no big huge boobies
01:43:59 no porn whatsoever
01:44:01 nothing the words fuck
01:44:03 and shit
01:44:05 and succubus
01:44:07 and boob all banned
01:44:09 all of them in the trash you can't type those words in
01:44:11 or we'll ban your account
01:44:13 I can only imagine
01:44:15 how fucking horrifying the results
01:44:17 of trying to make porn
01:44:19 with this thing would be
01:44:21 I think I would throw
01:44:23 I think cheesy was trying to make
01:44:25 porn with that
01:44:27 with Dolly
01:44:29 yeah
01:44:31 I did not have great results
01:44:33 but these would be
01:44:35 so much worse
01:44:37 I did things that they would probably
01:44:39 be able to recreate
01:44:41 typing in porn
01:44:43 I don't want to see what it thinks porn is
01:44:45 but like oh Bikini Babe
01:44:47 it could figure that out
01:44:49 and it could do like oh huge butt
01:44:51 like yeah that's doable
01:44:53 the faces were all fucked up
01:44:55 and you know
01:44:57 not really a thing but I could
01:44:59 choose one of those and be like
01:45:01 I could base of drawing off of that
01:45:03 that's not even that bad
01:45:05 I think you're right
01:45:07 it's the future
01:45:09 I'm the future baby
01:45:13 what time is it
01:45:15 it is
01:45:17 wow we've only been
01:45:19 hit with a wave of tiredness
01:45:21 damn okay
01:45:23 like I said I didn't sleep that well last night
01:45:25 because I was up
01:45:27 what's the word
01:45:29 just enthralled
01:45:31 by the slenderman
01:45:33 the slenderman stabbers
01:45:35 they are so infalling
01:45:37 I've been
01:45:39 I've been like tired
01:45:41 like fatigued
01:45:43 from camp
01:45:45 it's been a pretty
01:45:47 chill camp
01:45:49 all things considered because coronavirus
01:45:51 obviously couldn't do it
01:45:53 for a year
01:45:55 I got home
01:45:57 I got home yesterday
01:45:59 and I had a huge
01:46:01 nap
01:46:03 that I didn't expect I would have
01:46:05 and I woke up later that night
01:46:07 and I'm like you know
01:46:09 alright
01:46:11 I guess it wasn't night time
01:46:13 it was just getting dark
01:46:15 and then today
01:46:17 we were going to have the meet up
01:46:19 we went to the pub
01:46:21 we talked about some stuff
01:46:23 and then I came back
01:46:25 and I'm like
01:46:27 alright I'm gonna go
01:46:29 to bed
01:46:31 and I nearly missed the procrastinated podcast
01:46:33 that would have been
01:46:35 such a long time
01:46:37 that would have been really fucked up
01:46:39 hmm
01:46:41 yeah I still feel like my legs don't work
01:46:43 like I've been walking because we're in a field
01:46:45 you gotta
01:46:47 if you need to get anything
01:46:49 you need to walk all the way across the field
01:46:51 every time
01:46:53 there's a lot of walking
01:46:55 my legs hurt
01:46:57 well they don't hurt but they feel like
01:46:59 they have less power and I keep
01:47:01 losing my balance
01:47:03 hmm
01:47:05 I gotta sleep more
01:47:07 I gotta get a big sleep on
01:47:09 saw
01:47:11 saw a tweet
01:47:13 saw a tweet from
01:47:15 what's her name
01:47:17 that was like when I lay down in a comfy bed
01:47:19 you know I'm gonna be on my
01:47:21 me-me-me-me-me and honk-shoe
01:47:23 honk-shoe type shit

01:47:27 on
01:47:29 you know what I'm saying
01:47:31 I don't know what you mean
01:47:33 like cartoons, cartoon sleep sound effects
01:47:35 me-me-me-me-me-me
01:47:37 honk-shoe
01:47:39 honk-shoe
01:47:41 shoe
01:47:43 me-me-me-me-me-me

01:47:51 stop hitting myself
01:47:53 stop hitting yourself
01:47:55 I did
01:47:57 I did do you want to do
01:47:59 do you want to go to voicemails
01:48:01 sure yeah we've been going

01:48:07 well uh let's uh
01:48:09 let me get them where did I where did I
01:48:11 put them where did I put those little guys
01:48:13 there they are
01:48:15 the first voicemail
01:48:17 is
01:48:19 okay well it's it's just a question
01:48:21 what if you and
01:48:23 no sorry
01:48:25 it's
01:48:27 what if you invite a former pcp just for one episode
01:48:29 I don't know then they'd be on for one episode
01:48:31 okay that that was terrible never mind
01:48:33 sorry
01:48:35 sorry
01:48:37 okay
01:48:43 I'm stalling
01:48:45 I'm stalling because I can't find the link okay here we go
01:48:47 uh
01:48:49 this one is called
01:48:51 about a meme
01:48:53 alright three two one go
01:48:57 so since this is probably
01:48:59 just the best use of my time
01:49:01 to talk about an already
01:49:03 obsolete meme with
01:49:05 um my favorite internet
01:49:07 micro celebrity uh Ben
01:49:09 about the garlic bread
01:49:11 meme
01:49:13 obviously the joke
01:49:15 although not very cool or original
01:49:17 is that garlic bread
01:49:19 is a more well endowed version
01:49:21 of the original
01:49:23 normal bread
01:49:25 just like the woman with the big titties
01:49:27 is a more well endowed
01:49:29 version of the woman
01:49:31 with the smaller boobs
01:49:33 even though I realize
01:49:35 that that is somewhat
01:49:37 sexist and
01:49:39 in keeping with gender
01:49:41 norms and why am I
01:49:43 talking about this
01:49:45 what am I doing with my life
01:49:47 I get it
01:49:49 no listen I get
01:49:51 that the meme was like
01:49:53 I don't know
01:49:55 I guess it was just pointing out like
01:49:57 girl
01:49:59 there's one thing
01:50:01 like you have bread and you have girl
01:50:03 a bread with
01:50:05 extra is garlic bread
01:50:07 girl with extra is big boob
01:50:09 girl so it's like
01:50:11 a big boob girl is like a girl
01:50:13 with extra
01:50:15 some extra goodness on there and like
01:50:17 I get it
01:50:19 I just think it's a very banal
01:50:21 observation to the point that it's irritating
01:50:23 to say it
01:50:25 it's almost like
01:50:27 saying I like garlic bread
01:50:29 like image finished
01:50:31 or I like
01:50:33 boobs
01:50:35 it's like almost a facebook
01:50:37 boomer meme
01:50:39 I think that's
01:50:41 pretty much how I feel about it
01:50:43 I did get it
01:50:45 I didn't like it
01:50:47 I thought it was a stupid
01:50:49 or it could be that they think the girls
01:50:51 with big boobs stink
01:50:53 I don't like them
01:50:55 I do like garlic bread
01:50:57 and I don't like big boobs
01:50:59 so I said no
01:51:01 that seems incorrect
01:51:03 they got it wrong
01:51:05 they fucked it up
01:51:07 next one
01:51:09 is called hypocrisy
01:51:13 three two one go
01:51:15 people always ask
01:51:17 where
01:51:19 is Nate
01:51:21 where is Tom Oliver
01:51:23 where is
01:51:25 Trixie
01:51:27 but no one ever asks
01:51:29 where
01:51:31 is Ben Saint
01:51:33 I want to
01:51:35 go kill him
01:51:37 it's a travesty
01:51:39 he's right
01:51:41 he's so
01:51:43 right
01:51:45 where are your fingers
01:51:47 and why are they around Ben Saint's
01:51:49 road
01:51:51 I
01:51:53 all I want to know
01:51:55 is where is the podcast
01:51:57 where is
01:51:59 I have still not uploaded
01:52:01 any more stuff
01:52:03 to the
01:52:05 apps because I still don't know
01:52:07 if anything there is to be done
01:52:09 about the fact that new posts
01:52:11 delete the old ones
01:52:13 I think we just
01:52:15 have it be the
01:52:17 latest episodes
01:52:19 that are an option
01:52:21 and if people really want to go back
01:52:23 they'll have to go to YouTube
01:52:25 you already
01:52:27 can't listen to the first 12 episodes
01:52:29 on
01:52:31 Spotify
01:52:33 and maybe Google podcasts
01:52:35 you can on the
01:52:37 website
01:52:39 you can on YouTube
01:52:41 and
01:52:43 I feel like the people who would go
01:52:45 back
01:52:47 people who get into the podcast
01:52:49 probably just find new episodes anyway
01:52:51 they don't think this is a great show
01:52:53 let's go to episode 1
01:52:55 maybe they do
01:52:57 maybe that helps everyone
01:52:59 if you did want to do that it's possible
01:53:01 it's just not on Spotify
01:53:03 whatever
01:53:05 you're probably right
01:53:09 the next one is
01:53:11 Slime times
01:53:13 weekend update
01:53:15 number 9
01:53:17 3,2,1
01:53:19 go
01:53:21 hello, hello, hello
01:53:23 welcome back gangsters
01:53:25 to the slime times weekend update
01:53:27 today is a little bit of a quickie
01:53:29 because I am too busy because of
01:53:31 rowdy rough house
01:53:33 fun fun fun party weekend
01:53:35 in lieu of fun party weekend
01:53:37 not because of it but
01:53:39 strangely related
01:53:41 there has been an update to the game
01:53:43 where fun has been added
01:53:45 to the game and the
01:53:47 prefix
01:53:49 which is normally exclamation point
01:53:51 can now be changed to fun
01:53:53 if you are holding a fun pizza
01:53:55 and you use the command
01:53:57 exclamation point fun
01:53:59 very, very intriguing indeed
01:54:01 furthermore the rough house
01:54:03 party weekend marks also
01:54:05 the end of the term of the 3 ring
01:54:07 leaders who will be giving up their
01:54:09 position and new elections will be held
01:54:11 finally some
01:54:13 interesting ARG figures
01:54:15 have appeared in the city among whom
01:54:17 are mysterious D of
01:54:19 strange seemingly former slime
01:54:21 corp employee and mainframe
01:54:23 a weird
01:54:25 AI computer
01:54:27 thingy magic
01:54:29 I don't understand technology
01:54:31 okay ta ta
01:54:33 yeah fun
01:54:35 I was aware that fun was added
01:54:37 to the game
01:54:39 I tried to have
01:54:41 as a stat
01:54:43 as a
01:54:45 it's more than just
01:54:47 a stat it's a way of life
01:54:51 I
01:54:53 was told to try to have some fun
01:54:55 to use the fun command
01:54:57 so I did I tried to use
01:54:59 the fun command
01:55:01 but I didn't have a fun pizza
01:55:03 so I died
01:55:05 even though I'm a king
01:55:07 which like
01:55:09 pretty much just was like a cataclysmic
01:55:11 offense
01:55:13 I don't been saying
01:55:15 the cop killer tried to have fun
01:55:17 but I didn't have a fun pizza
01:55:19 I don't know what I thought
01:55:21 was gonna happen
01:55:23 but they you know
01:55:25 listen I mean you know
01:55:27 they're working out the kinks but we're but
01:55:29 they're having a lot of fun with it so
01:55:31 it's good
01:55:33 I like that this yeah they're having a lot
01:55:35 they're having a lot of fun they were literally
01:55:37 having zero fun before
01:55:39 because fun had not been invented yet but now
01:55:41 the game
01:55:43 includes fun as one of its many
01:55:45 features so that's
01:55:47 big big
01:55:49 big things are happening
01:55:51 in rfck right now
01:55:53 the next level
01:55:55 of that joke is
01:55:57 for fun to be the most annoying
01:55:59 part of the game that nobody likes doing
01:56:01 but everyone feels obligated to
01:56:03 have fun don't be ridiculous
01:56:05 who would find fun annoying
01:56:07 it's fun that's what kind
01:56:09 of a killjoy would you have to be to
01:56:11 even suggest that fun
01:56:13 wasn't fun
01:56:15 uh
01:56:17 just
01:56:19 shit I'd fucking lost my
01:56:21 uh lost my mind
01:56:23 lost my mind lost my mind
01:56:25 okay the next one is just a question
01:56:27 Ben what do you think of the pewdiepie
01:56:29 twitter drama and uh
01:56:31 I don't know what that's referring to
01:56:33 I haven't I haven't heard a peep
01:56:35 about that so who cares
01:56:37 I think I did see
01:56:39 pewdiepie mentioned
01:56:41 somewhere and he
01:56:43 I think he was reacting
01:56:45 to
01:56:47 politician or something or he was reacting to
01:56:49 some
01:56:51 I don't know I don't know if that's what this is about
01:56:53 yeah I don't know what the drama is
01:56:55 next one is happy

01:58:35 he has moved his
01:58:37 his uh his
01:58:39 schedule up he said he's gonna

01:58:55 is making you have heard that before
01:58:57 I have I have heard that before
01:58:59 but uh we I don't know we talked about it more
01:59:01 extensively and
01:59:03 uh
01:59:05 I I believe
01:59:07 well I believe
01:59:09 that he
01:59:11 sincerely intends to do it
01:59:13 um
01:59:17 uh I don't know
01:59:19 I
01:59:21 mean
01:59:23 I don't
01:59:25 what else can you do
01:59:27 what else what else can I do
01:59:29 yeah
01:59:31 I mean he did he did eventually do
01:59:33 the uh the uh
01:59:35 the the the music video
01:59:37 on on that subject
01:59:39 um you've seen this
01:59:41 Gib drinking moth
01:59:43 who has sent in many a voicemail
01:59:45 in a fan art drinking drinking moth
01:59:47 has picked up a couple of uh
01:59:49 the dojin pages and has been
01:59:51 doing some of them and they look really good
01:59:53 I'm I'm I'm I'm impressed
01:59:55 I'm impressed I didn't know
01:59:57 if she could uh match
01:59:59 Ed's style and I would say
02:00:01 she did a great job so
02:00:03 I think I will maybe uh let her
02:00:05 do more if she wants
02:00:07 um damn
02:00:09 yeah Simsie is also working on one
02:00:11 he had sketched out like half
02:00:13 of one and I don't know how far
02:00:15 it is but uh
02:00:17 so yeah a few more pages done on that
02:00:19 it is getting I think there's maybe like
02:00:21 nine or ten maybe about
02:00:23 ten pages left to go after all that so
02:00:25 that'll be fun it's gonna be
02:00:27 finished it will actually be finished
02:00:29 and I'll I'll print it
02:00:31 and it'll have credits it'll have all the
02:00:33 writers credits and all the artists credits
02:00:35 on the inside cover probably and it will be
02:00:37 fun
02:00:39 I can't wait to

02:02:45 next one is called
02:02:47 oh wait I just posted it
02:02:49 Hi Ben 3 2 1
02:02:51 go
02:02:53 oh
02:02:55 is this is this some bullshit

02:02:59 I forgot that
02:03:01 I forgot nothing
02:03:03 so I still have an appointment
02:03:05 the doctor came out and I followed it today
02:03:07 and the only thing
02:03:09 just covert recording of their family
02:03:11 that's great
02:03:13 that's great
02:03:15 that's fantastic yes
02:03:17 what are you gonna do
02:03:19 more undercover videos of unsuspecting people
02:03:21 like
02:03:23 they have parents
02:03:25 potentially
02:03:27 oh no
02:03:29 why didn't they tell me
02:03:31 they have parents
02:03:33 next one is called thank you
02:03:35 or it's called t y y y y y y
02:03:37 3 2 1
02:03:39 go
02:03:41 why
02:03:43 they're typing
02:03:45 they're typing their message
02:03:47 we have to interpret from the key clacks
02:03:49 but they're just
02:03:51 it's like
02:03:53 like I can tell they're just running their hand over it
02:03:57 okay great
02:03:59 this one is an image
02:04:01 but there's also an audio
02:04:03 so here's the imager link
02:04:05 right there
02:04:07 breaking train strikes
02:04:09 rail workers have been left with no choice
02:04:11 but to escalate industrial action
02:04:13 due to the NSFW
02:04:15 government refusal to commit to
02:04:17 safety changes and decision to get
02:04:19 to gut family and domestic violence leave
02:04:21 for rail workers
02:04:23 okay
02:04:25 my brain didn't read that
02:04:27 but I didn't understand anything
02:04:29 because I'm not thinking
02:04:31 so there's a rail worker strike because of
02:04:33 government
02:04:35 cutbacks
02:04:37 government doesn't care about human beings
02:04:39 and that sucks
02:04:41 the next one
02:04:43 here's the audio
02:04:45 3 2 1 go
02:04:57 3 2 1 go
02:05:17 they're just opening the gates
02:05:19 oh that's cool
02:05:21 that's uh very cool
02:05:23 very good, very base
02:05:25 uh
02:05:27 nice
02:05:29 heartwarming
02:05:31 the next one is called
02:05:33 the stunning
02:05:35 buffer effect
02:05:37 uh
02:05:39 yeah the stunning buffer effect
02:05:41 there it is 3 2 1 go
02:05:55 there's some problem that you can't really seem to
02:05:57 get over
02:05:59 and maybe their heads in the right place
02:06:01 or they just don't have all the details
02:06:03 instead of trying to address the problem
02:06:05 you just say ah you see
02:06:07 you're the stunning
02:06:09 buffer effect
02:06:11 you think you know more than you know
02:06:13 but actually you're a complete idiot
02:06:15 don't you think that's interesting
02:06:17 and you walk away
02:06:19 well the thing is
02:06:21 you're that guy that's you
02:06:23 haven't attempted to like make the
02:06:25 problem better
02:06:27 you don't bring it up in an argument
02:06:29 to win the argument
02:06:31 try to teach them anything
02:06:33 try to mend their misunderstanding
02:06:35 all you've done
02:06:37 is try and make yourself look smarter
02:06:39 than you actually are by
02:06:41 bringing up something completely unrelated
02:06:43 I don't think this works
02:06:45 I think this guy is done in program
02:06:47 himself
02:06:49 I just thought that was interesting
02:06:51 this amazing idea
02:06:53 the Dunning Kruger effect is most
02:06:55 it's the Dunning Kruger effect mostly
02:06:57 I agree it would be stupid
02:06:59 if someone is
02:07:01 talking out their ass about something
02:07:03 to be like aha I have
02:07:05 I got you now you see
02:07:07 you have lost the argument because
02:07:09 you are Dunning Krugering
02:07:11 you're Dunning Krugering so hard right now
02:07:13 I don't know that happens the most
02:07:15 but I've not even
02:07:17 that's not the context I generally here
02:07:19 I don't know
02:07:21 maybe it happens
02:07:23 I'm actually slightly disappointed
02:07:25 because
02:07:27 the real interesting thing about the Dunning Kruger effect
02:07:29 and how it's misunderstood
02:07:31 a lot by people who quote it is the fact
02:07:33 that the graph is different
02:07:35 explain
02:07:37 okay so
02:07:39 it's like when someone is new to a topic
02:07:41 they're just getting into it
02:07:43 they're like oh I'm starting to understand this
02:07:45 wow I know everything
02:07:47 oh you know they think they're real smart
02:07:49 and all that and then
02:07:51 the usual graph you see is one
02:07:53 that looks like this right
02:07:55 if we'll post it's like
02:07:57 yeah
02:07:59 yeah and like it's a useful
02:08:01 illustrative tool
02:08:03 but there's actually been tests
02:08:05 into people's confidence
02:08:07 versus their actual ability
02:08:09 because you can test that
02:08:11 you can like
02:08:13 quiz people on like
02:08:15 if they think you know this topic
02:08:17 or that topic or this other topic
02:08:19 and they'll give like a response
02:08:21 and then you can test them
02:08:23 let me guess does it actually like
02:08:25 rise in zigzags
02:08:27 pretty much
02:08:29 very subtly zigzags
02:08:31 this isn't quite what I was
02:08:33 wait a minute but okay
02:08:35 what's going on here
02:08:37 well the actual test score is going to be a straight line
02:08:39 because that's just 0 to 100
02:08:41 right
02:08:43 like
02:08:45 I don't know it sort of just goes up
02:08:47 um
02:08:49 but I guess
02:08:51 you know I've seen the second one
02:08:53 I do
02:08:55 forget that this is
02:08:57 because like
02:08:59 it's the
02:09:01 overestimation of your ability
02:09:03 versus the underestimation
02:09:05 of your ability when you're actually more capable
02:09:07 than you realize
02:09:09 that's the main thing
02:09:11 the real effect is that
02:09:13 everyone thinks they're above 50%
02:09:15 even
02:09:17 when they're definitely not
02:09:23 that's the real effect that you get from this
02:09:25 and also at the
02:09:27 end where people who are really smart
02:09:29 like under
02:09:31 sell themselves a little bit
02:09:33 those are like the real takeaways from this I think
02:09:35 and I think that's interesting
02:09:37 I feel like these
02:09:39 are not totally at odds
02:09:41 with each other
02:09:43 I mean
02:09:45 they're not the same
02:09:47 but like you know you have the bottom quartile
02:09:49 which like
02:09:51 they do overestimate themselves
02:09:53 by the biggest amount
02:09:55 and then that number goes down and down
02:09:57 until it eventually flips
02:09:59 to the negative
02:10:03 I feel like it's exaggerated
02:10:05 for effect but like maybe
02:10:07 it gives
02:10:09 a wrong impression
02:10:11 of how much confidence
02:10:13 people have when they're just starting out
02:10:15 because it's not as higher than
02:10:17 the highest
02:10:19 the first one is sort of a PragerU
02:10:21 like
02:10:23 what units are confidence measured in
02:10:25 in this graph
02:10:27 confidence is like
02:10:29 loudness of voice when saying
02:10:31 how cool you are
02:10:33 decibels
02:10:35 I mean the first graph
02:10:37 could probably be true
02:10:39 if you limited like
02:10:41 your test to only people
02:10:43 who like have super like
02:10:45 big egos
02:10:47 and think they're super smart
02:10:49 because
02:10:51 I guess the second graph is more looking at like
02:10:53 an average population maybe
02:10:55 because most people aren't
02:10:57 super cocky like that
02:10:59 but like for people who are super cocky
02:11:01 maybe the first graph would apply a little bit
02:11:03 but the first graph is more
02:11:05 just like an idea
02:11:07 if it's an average then
02:11:09 it would just mean that on average
02:11:11 people with
02:11:13 lower skill
02:11:15 would
02:11:17 more likely rate themselves
02:11:19 much higher
02:11:21 than people with higher skill
02:11:23 I'm curious like what this test was
02:11:25 in because I don't think
02:11:27 every subject matter
02:11:29 is something that like everyone thinks
02:11:31 they're above 50%
02:11:33 at
02:11:35 I've never looked into the initial
02:11:37 like papers on it
02:11:39 well I
02:11:41 I got it from watching this video which
02:11:43 I watched quite a long time ago
02:11:45 they might be more information
02:11:47 or maybe there's a source
02:11:49 I guess I'm curious
02:11:51 about the methodology
02:11:53 that generated this graph and like what
02:11:55 yeah like what the
02:11:57 what was being tested exactly
02:11:59 is there
02:12:01 ability to 360 no scope
02:12:05 like was it like
02:12:07 SAT
02:12:09 like SAT like language
02:12:11 and like basic like math geometry stuff
02:12:13 or was it like I don't know
02:12:15 some kind of specialized
02:12:17 field and was it was the test
02:12:19 done among people who were involved
02:12:21 in that field or was it done among complete layman
02:12:23 who literally like didn't know anything at all
02:12:25 about it period
02:12:27 I feel like that would affect the results
02:12:29 like for the results to be
02:12:31 as good as possible
02:12:33 it would need to be like as broad
02:12:35 a range but yeah I don't know
02:12:37 it would who did it's like two
02:12:39 people it would need to be like four people
02:12:41 they asked it would need to be something that like
02:12:43 even any anyone in
02:12:45 the general population is at least somewhat
02:12:47 familiar with but that there also
02:12:49 exists the possibility to become
02:12:51 like an expert in
02:12:53 like
02:12:55 maybe something like
02:12:57 reading people's body language
02:12:59 or something like that
02:13:01 this is overgraph I mean
02:13:03 the full studies that these are from
02:13:05 are not linked in the description
02:13:07 they're just named I guess I could
02:13:09 we could look into it
02:13:11 if we wanted to be smart
02:13:13 boys
02:13:15 but I'm
02:13:17 what's the confidence versus accuracy
02:13:19 I don't entirely know I'd watch the video
02:13:21 but then I'd be hearing audio
02:13:23 and not hearing you guys
02:13:25 okay Elia is our
02:13:27 we're all just going to pause the podcast
02:13:29 and watch this video
02:13:31 and you're going to leave it
02:13:33 you're going to leave it all in
02:13:35 you're going to leave it all in
02:13:37 I'll watch this later
02:13:39 I'll watch it later I need a refresher
02:13:41 dumbass Kroger
02:13:43 okay the next one
02:13:45 is
02:13:47 again there's an Imgur album
02:13:49 plus audio so let's
02:13:51 see the album first
02:13:53 my stands
02:13:55 it's a JoJo thing
02:13:57 crystal method
02:13:59 this is written in
02:14:01 Spanish
02:14:05 this is cute
02:14:07 I like this sort of stuff I used to do this
02:14:09 no this exactly but
02:14:11 these are JoJo stands
02:14:15 with
02:14:17 their stats
02:14:19 potential power
02:14:21 speed precision durability range
02:14:23 movement
02:14:25 movement energizes the limbs and heart
02:14:27 making it faster but too much burns the
02:14:29 oh these are descriptions of what each one does
02:14:33 these are actually really cool designs
02:14:35 I like the
02:14:37 the second guy's sort of face
02:14:39 they don't really
02:14:41 I'm not that much of a JoJo head
02:14:43 I don't know what stands are
02:14:45 I
02:14:47 I haven't watched any JoJo
02:14:49 not that I'm complaining
02:14:51 but why did you send these
02:14:53 to our voicemail
02:14:55 I don't know they're proud of it
02:14:57 I guess
02:14:59 put them on a fridge
02:15:01 that's fair enough
02:15:03 let's hear the
02:15:05 audio maybe there's a
02:15:07 elaboration
02:15:09 here we go
02:15:11 alright
02:15:13 3, 2, 1 go
02:15:15 a very fun idea
02:15:17 to draw
02:15:19 have you ever tried making
02:15:21 stands like in JoJo
02:15:23 JoJo stands
02:15:25 I drew my own on a
02:15:27 or a superpower
02:15:29 very specific or complicated
02:15:31 or stupid
02:15:33 you make
02:15:35 a humanoid type
02:15:39 thing
02:15:41 maybe with the stand user beside it
02:15:43 like
02:15:45 very abstract I really like
02:15:47 to do it
02:15:49 I have one idea
02:15:51 stand
02:15:53 he has
02:15:55 a catch of containers
02:15:57 that shoots a substance
02:15:59 that whatever the user is thinking
02:16:01 whatever food he's thinking
02:16:03 he makes whatever
02:16:05 he splashes out
02:16:07 the thing so like
02:16:09 he can turn you
02:16:11 into a cracker and break you easily
02:16:13 what
02:16:15 he thinks of a food
02:16:17 it turns you into the food
02:16:19 he has a catch up container
02:16:21 but it squirts the thing you're thinking of
02:16:25 so it squirts out crackers
02:16:27 if you think about crackers
02:16:29 you have like a ketchup bottle
02:16:31 and you squeeze it
02:16:33 and crackers come out
02:16:35 it says liquid
02:16:37 it says a liquid substance comes out
02:16:39 based on a food you're thinking of
02:16:41 so what part of that turns you
02:16:43 into a cracker so he can break you
02:16:45 into crackers
02:16:47 I think it's separate from the ketchup thing
02:16:49 he can think of you as a food
02:16:51 and then like eat you as such
02:16:53 like you are a hot dog and then he
02:16:55 bites you
02:16:59 I mean
02:17:01 pretty wacky
02:17:03 but if you to counter it
02:17:05 you have to just think of yourself as really
02:17:07 appetizing food and then you can't bite you
02:17:13 do you like hummus?
02:17:15 oh I don't know
02:17:17 I can't eat you now
02:17:19 you foiled me
02:17:21 but it's not halal
02:17:23 nope I'm not halal
02:17:25 I got pork in me
02:17:27 I can't be hummus
02:17:29 you reform back into a man
02:17:31 next one is
02:17:33 where was I
02:17:35 where was I
02:17:37 Ben's Weekly Reminder play delta room chapter 2
02:17:39 okay Ben's Weekly Reminder
02:17:41 ketchup to one piece I actually
02:17:43 really do mean to do that
02:17:45 oh I need to do that as well
02:17:47 apparently a big image
02:17:49 that I want to look at
02:17:51 I've been seeing a lot of Yamato fan art
02:17:53 on Twitter lately
02:17:55 Yamato is so fucking cool
02:17:57 I didn't really
02:17:59 like the idea of him joining
02:18:01 the crew like so quick
02:18:03 it seemed like it happened
02:18:05 really fast
02:18:07 I mean
02:18:09 maybe I'll change my mind
02:18:13 maybe because you read it all at once
02:18:15 I've been reading
02:18:17 1.0 like weekly and so it has been
02:18:19 like years since it began
02:18:21 maybe even
02:18:23 a year since Yamato was introduced
02:18:25 on the
02:18:27 thing so like
02:18:29 I guess it did come a bit abrupt
02:18:31 like
02:18:33 I want to join but it did make
02:18:35 sense because
02:18:37 he the fucking
02:18:39 all of the thing
02:18:41 with Odin going away
02:18:43 and seeing the world
02:18:45 is like paralleled because of the
02:18:47 they want to be Odin
02:18:49 near all that
02:18:51 and Momo is like
02:18:53 like capable
02:18:55 of protecting himself now
02:18:57 I
02:18:59 yeah I need to
02:19:01 I need to get I must be like
02:19:03 10 or 12 chapters

02:19:21 are going on with that yet
02:19:23 but I do
02:19:25 I feel like I feel like I'm missing out
02:19:27 by not being caught up
02:19:29 you should because like
02:19:31 I mean it's always fun
02:19:33 after the big events to see how the world
