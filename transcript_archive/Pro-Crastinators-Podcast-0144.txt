00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:27 I'm the best guy ever and today we've got Hippocrit, are you?
00:00:36 We've got Ben Saint.
00:00:38 I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay.
00:00:42 We've got Lethal Aurora Mage.
00:00:45 I regret to inform you all that I am once again addicted to Animal Crossing New Leaf.
00:00:53 You swore you'd never do it again.
00:00:56 I'm sorry.
00:00:57 I needed my fix.
00:00:58 And we've got Endless Jess.
00:00:59 Endless Jess.
00:01:00 Hey, it's Franklin.
00:01:01 Come into your house.
00:01:02 Hey, it's Franklin.
00:01:03 Come into play.
00:01:04 You ever see that level one mafia grunt as Caillou and the level 100 mafia boss as one punchman?
00:01:23 Was the middle one Charlie Brown?
00:01:26 I guess that would work.
00:01:28 Caillou's so fucking retarded.
00:01:29 Anyway, hey everybody.
00:01:30 Welcome to another episode.
00:01:31 Yeah, fuck that guy.
00:01:32 Today we're talking about Fuck Caillou.
00:01:35 It was the worst child show I ever watched.
00:01:38 I never watched Caillou.
00:01:39 I don't think.
00:01:40 I guess it was for like actual infants.
00:01:42 Yes.
00:01:43 Well, yeah.
00:01:44 It was for actual babies.
00:01:45 Well, the plot lines were frankly patronizing.
00:01:48 I know I have to wipe my butt after I take a shit.
00:01:51 Thank you very much.
00:01:52 I didn't need to be a lower yourself to my level.
00:01:56 I'm glad you brought up that topic.
00:01:59 This is the topic that I want to touch on.
00:02:00 I'm sick of wiping.
00:02:02 I'm done with it.
00:02:03 I hate it.
00:02:06 I hate shitting.
00:02:07 I hate wiping.
00:02:08 It's a fucking nightmare every time.
00:02:11 You know, I have somewhat evolved my handling of that situation.
00:02:17 I'm doing a lot of washing after wiping these days.
00:02:21 I've just upgraded and I think it's better.
00:02:23 There is no after wiping for me.
00:02:26 Something about like I've got the poopiest shits and the slimyist craps.
00:02:31 I'm just never done wiping.
00:02:32 The wiping never stops.
00:02:34 It's a curse.
00:02:35 I can't get off the toilet for hours.
00:02:37 It's like they say, it's like they say, wiping is never, oh fuck, a wipe is never completed.
00:02:43 Only abandoned.
00:02:44 Right.
00:02:45 But it's abandoned and then shown and that's what matters to people.
00:02:48 Cut all of this.
00:02:49 That's the biggest difference.
00:02:50 Take this out.
00:02:51 Hey, speaking of, let's talk about, let's talk about cartoons featuring bald people.
00:02:57 Like Steven, after he, Rebecca snatched his wig off in that finale, is that what you're
00:03:02 talking about?
00:03:03 After Rebecca Sugar made him come out as a skinhead, like she meant to all along, and
00:03:09 become sands.
00:03:10 Yeah, I was going to say come out as sands, have you seen the video?
00:03:14 I've seen the image.
00:03:15 I've seen the image.
00:03:16 Yeah, I was going to say.
00:03:17 Okay, okay.
00:03:18 You guys ever see a cartoon called Fillmore, exclamation point?
00:03:21 Yeah.
00:03:22 No.
00:03:23 Okay.
00:03:24 No question.
00:03:25 Okay.
00:03:26 I'm googling it.
00:03:27 I think I saw it like once.
00:03:28 Like one time on some channel, I was, I watched this cartoon called Fillmore and it is about
00:03:32 a kid.
00:03:33 It's about, it's like a high school, it's a high school cartoon, but it's like, it's
00:03:37 like a noir, it's like framed as like a noir detective kind of story.
00:03:43 And I saw like one episode of it ever and I thought that was the coolest thing I've ever
00:03:47 fucking seen.
00:03:48 And then I never saw it again.
00:03:51 I was like, for the rest of my youth, I was like, when, what the fuck was that?
00:03:56 Like when will I ever see Fillmore again?
00:03:59 Like I want to see more of it.
00:04:01 Are they even allowed to put black people on TV?
00:04:03 This is weird, man.
00:04:05 Watch out.
00:04:06 Yeah.
00:04:07 That's you, Ben.
00:04:08 Wainhead.
00:04:09 I didn't say anything about him being black because it totally doesn't matter.
00:04:11 And he doesn't, it's like, you know, I think I was watching some, I watched it.
00:04:16 What are you denying his racial identity now, Ben?
00:04:19 You're in a hot water, son.
00:04:20 I saw some YouTube video.
00:04:22 It was, it was called like, I think it was called how to black.
00:04:25 Oh, I saw that.
00:04:26 Yeah.
00:04:27 It was recommended to me and it was a guy talking about like how to write black characters.
00:04:31 And this, you know, the guy making the video was black himself.
00:04:35 And he said, like, you know, in his opinion, like you don't have to, you know, it's tough
00:04:42 because like, I think some, some of those, some certain like white, guilty type people
00:04:46 would say like, you know, you got, you can't just, you can't just write black characters.
00:04:50 You don't know the black experience, but like, you don't have to.
00:04:54 The story doesn't have to be about them being black.
00:04:56 Like it's okay if it's okay sometimes, maybe even most of the time, if a character being
00:05:02 black or white or whatever doesn't really inform the story much, it doesn't have to
00:05:06 be with the stories about that film or like film or could have been whatever.
00:05:10 He's just, he just looks like Morpheus and it rules.
00:05:15 He does.
00:05:16 He does remind me of Morpheus.
00:05:17 You ever see Wayne Head though?
00:05:19 No.
00:05:20 No.
00:05:21 Wayne Head is like, there was like in the nineties, there was this entire genre of cartoons
00:05:26 that were like, like made by black people specifically for black children.
00:05:32 Like they were like these really ghetto, like urban, like all the characters looked like
00:05:38 really racist.
00:05:39 Like Fat Albert?
00:05:40 Like if a white person had drawn the cartoon, it would be considered racist as hell, but
00:05:45 because they were made by, they were all made by the Wayne's brothers or something, like
00:05:49 every different Wayne's brother had their own shitty cartoon series with like these really...
00:05:54 How many, how many Wayne's brothers are there?
00:05:56 I don't know, like fifty?
00:05:57 Three?
00:05:58 Hundreds.
00:05:59 Okay.
00:06:00 But Wayne Head was like this, like urban, just like weird.
00:06:02 They're breeding.
00:06:03 The whole show was about this kid with a club foot.
00:06:05 God, this character design.
00:06:06 That's the point.
00:06:07 This giant foot.
00:06:09 And that was like, he was like, oh, yeah, yeah, he had like a, he had like, he called it his
00:06:13 big shoe.
00:06:14 Um, I remember that one.
00:06:16 I don't remember what it was called, but yeah, he had like a foot brace because there was
00:06:19 something up with his leg.
00:06:20 Yeah.
00:06:21 And the theme song was like, Wayne Head, Wayne Head, the party's just begun.
00:06:26 And like the theme song actually has a part in it that went, hey, ho, hey.
00:06:32 Like, like...
00:06:33 Alright.
00:06:34 Okay.
00:06:35 Alright.
00:06:36 So this is the realism of the head and foot exclusively.
00:06:39 It's pretty freakish.
00:06:40 You ever notice how black people make art that's like really racist against black people
00:06:44 and don't seem to notice that they're, that they're being racist against themselves?
00:06:48 Well, but that's not racist then.
00:06:50 Yeah.
00:06:51 Well, for them, it's just like, it's like, you know, isn't it funny how people do this?
00:06:56 You know?
00:06:57 Which like, you know, everyone does that.
00:07:00 But you know, if you're white...
00:07:01 I'll just, I'll just...
00:07:02 Listen, listen, if you're white and you're watching a cartoon by a black person that's
00:07:06 about like black kids living in...
00:07:08 It's already racist right there.
00:07:09 No, shit.
00:07:10 They're like living in the, living in the streets or whatever, not like homeless, but you know
00:07:14 what I mean.
00:07:15 You might, you look at that and be like, huh, wow, this is, this is, this is weird in what
00:07:20 it says about black people.
00:07:21 But like, you know, this is like, there's, you know, they're just writing about people
00:07:25 they know, writing about their, their life experience.
00:07:28 I don't know if it makes me racist.
00:07:29 I hope it doesn't, but I hated all of these black people cartoons.
00:07:33 Like they're just...
00:07:34 They were all like the proud family.
00:07:36 The proud family is a fucking disgrace.
00:07:39 I did not enjoy that show.
00:07:40 No, I did not.
00:07:41 The worst thing ever happened to the sequel was pretty decent.
00:07:44 You know, I wasn't, I wasn't particularly into the proud family either.
00:07:47 The whole, like the, like the whole proud family is like, there's like the dad and like the
00:07:52 grandma is like super abusive to the dad.
00:07:57 And it's played for the last cause she's like, you know, she's sugar mama.
00:08:00 She's like, it's, it's cool.
00:08:02 She's like a sassy black lady, but she's just like an abusive monster who like has
00:08:06 ruined the dad, his entire life by treating him like garbage and continues to treat him
00:08:11 like garbage and emasculate him daily, even as a man in charge of his own family.
00:08:16 She's the breadwinner.
00:08:17 She's the, the guy.
00:08:18 I hate, I hate sugar mama.
00:08:20 I want her to fucking die.
00:08:22 I want her to just, I want it.
00:08:23 I want, I always want an episode where she succumbed to dementia and ended up in a hospice
00:08:28 and died slowly.
00:08:30 And all of her family was around her and the last person in the room with her as she was
00:08:34 dying was Oscar.
00:08:36 I think his name was, was, was the son.
00:08:38 And he's just like Oscar Langley.
00:08:40 And like just as she's about to die, he's like, I don't forgive you.
00:08:44 And she just, she flat lines and that's it.
00:08:47 Yeah.
00:08:48 Well, I mean, I think I would have enjoyed that as well.
00:08:52 He did get abused, but I think they were trying to paint him.
00:08:55 I mean, as they always do, like he was a fuck up, like everyone around was trying to help
00:08:59 him and he just couldn't take their good advice and just was a fool through and through.
00:09:03 Was the proud family dad a fuck up?
00:09:05 Yeah.
00:09:06 He was like, he remember he was an inventor, but like he didn't make any money to support
00:09:09 the family.
00:09:10 What?
00:09:11 He was all the, the mom who was like a newscaster.
00:09:12 Wait, he's an inventor?
00:09:13 No.
00:09:14 Stu Pickles is an inventor.
00:09:15 Was he like a tinkerer?
00:09:16 Yeah.
00:09:17 Stu Pickles is the inventor.
00:09:18 I was thinking like, is he, is he like Stu Pickles again?
00:09:19 Okay.
00:09:20 I might have been confusing that.
00:09:21 There's no way.
00:09:22 I don't, I don't remember what he was or did.
00:09:27 Yeah.
00:09:28 I don't know these American cartoons.
00:09:30 Stu Pickles, now there was a cartoon dad.
00:09:33 I know that.
00:09:34 He was up, he was up at two in the morning making chocolate pudding.
00:09:38 That's, you're not wrong.
00:09:39 Yeah.
00:09:40 Let's go back to criticizing Caillou and these nice white families that I feel comfortable
00:09:44 talking to him about.
00:09:45 The only media I saw with Caillou is like with those go anime atrocities.
00:09:50 Yeah.
00:09:51 Have you seen, have you seen Giles theme goes with anything Stu makes chocolate pudding?
00:09:55 Well, of course.
00:09:57 Of course.
00:09:58 Of course.
00:09:59 Of course.
00:10:00 Da da da da da da.
00:10:02 Stairs, stairs.
00:10:03 That's some time with the music.
00:10:05 That's good stuff.
00:10:06 Classics.
00:10:07 But hey, okay.
00:10:08 Remember that episode of Rugrats where there was literally a time machine?
00:10:11 Is that Sprues?
00:10:12 Yeah.
00:10:13 I'm sure it was an imagination.
00:10:14 Boo Boo Rooms.
00:10:15 No, they go to the toy store and one of the, the brand new hot toy that all the kids
00:10:18 want is a literal fucking time machine.
00:10:21 Okay.
00:10:22 That's very cool.
00:10:23 You know what I realized is like a-
00:10:24 Wait is it actual or did they just imagine-
00:10:26 They they they activate an evil toy gorilla that's chasing them around and the way that they defeat it is they lure it into the time machine and send it back and
00:10:34 Back in time to fucking George Washington crossing the Delaware River
00:10:38 tape
00:10:41 I liked it that much imagine. I'm glad it's not just a fever dream. No, it's real
00:10:47 Okay, hang on. Are you sure that the that the the actual narrative was not that there was a
00:10:52 Playtime machine that was really fun to like pretend you were time-traveling
00:10:56 No, you literally see the gorilla materialize on the river as George Washington is crossing with his troops and they're like
00:11:03 What's that pretend? I don't think the kids were making believe
00:11:07 One-year-old kids making believe about George Washington in the Revolutionary War
00:11:13 Does it like happen where like a painting changes and not like there's a gorilla in the in the
00:11:19 One of the founding fathers gorilla
00:11:23 No twilight zone ending twilight zone ending they get the toy they go to the cash register and stew's like here
00:11:29 You go keep the change hands him a one dollar bill and it's
00:11:36 That would have been they should have gone for it. We should have committed to the bed
00:11:45 Everybody welcome to the cartoon podcast where the reason cartoons are dying. Yeah, that's true
00:11:52 Speaking of dying cartoons
00:11:56 Like I could have sort was a fever dream for like I don't know like ten years of my life or something
00:12:01 And when I was little and I was watching pop-up girls
00:12:04 I saw this episode once and only once and I don't know why they stopped airing it
00:12:08 But like it was something about like but a cup of bullying some kid that kept eating glue
00:12:13 I think and then he turned into a giant glue monster and then she had to
00:12:17 Yeah, well, why did she apologize? She was doing the right thing by bullying this because he was stronger than her now and he could be
00:12:24 Her up. Yes
00:12:26 He was a giant glue. So she actually yeah, you know, I think I do remember that
00:12:30 Um, I don't know that I watched a lot of power
00:12:33 But yeah, like that I only saw it once on TV and I have no clue why they never aired it again
00:12:38 Was it was it like banned like the like the gnome episode? Maybe it was encouraging kids see glue
00:12:44 Maybe people complained maybe oh man, okay
00:12:47 What we need is a be careful who you make fun of in high school meme of like nerd kid is a powerpuff girl and then giant glue monster
00:12:55 That's what she learns. That's a good lesson to prevent future school shootings. That's a big reason why well
00:13:01 We really need we need these these white boys to get laid. That's what we need
00:13:06 We need heroic women out there who are willing to put out to save our children. That's the number one thing that'll do it
00:13:12 Why are my words why I volunteer I volunteer to be one of those women
00:13:17 To be one of those women. That's right. Why didn't the powerpuff girls just fuck all the other kids?
00:13:25 Think of all yeah, they were missing the greatest superpower of all heightened sexuality an ounce of prevention is a pound of cure
00:13:35 We've all learned a lot here today. Thanks for joining us everyone on the procrastinating cartoon cast
00:13:41 Okay, Steven Universe. Let's talk about it. There was there was the new special. I think everybody here watched it
00:13:47 I have not seen the new ones, but I don't care about spoilers if you want to
00:13:54 A blot black cartoonist just putting their own worst stereotypes and cartoons this black character amethyst is just such a
00:14:01 disgusting
00:14:02 Hittiest freak. He's I don't know where I'm going with that. She's even doing things
00:14:08 These episodes anyway amethyst is growing. No, I'm like amethyst a lot. Oh, I was just I was just I it was black people
00:14:16 I was making fun of not amethyst. Oh, okay. That's fine. Yeah, that's good
00:14:21 So so there was a whatever a couple of episodes and a big special like a 45 minute finale episode
00:14:28 Season some backster did the last shot with the I knew it. I yeah, I was yes
00:14:34 Disney guy hell happened in this part it got all good, you know, okay
00:14:38 What was interesting about that? So there's a moment at the at the emotional climax of this scene a lot of crazy
00:14:43 Shits happening with a confrontation with white diamonds going down and all that stuff
00:14:47 And all of a sudden the animation goes from piece of shit flash garbage animation. It's not flash
00:14:52 unbelievably beautiful
00:14:54 like fluid Disney level Disney movie animation
00:14:59 They're
00:15:00 Proportions and sizes wouldn't change so drastically. I don't I guess that's true
00:15:06 I have no idea what I'm fucking talking about
00:15:07 But I do know that this got super fluid. No, I liked it a lot
00:15:11 but I was watching this with Michelle and
00:15:13 She actually kind of hated it because it was such a jarring transition from what Steven universe normally looks like
00:15:20 That you said like it really just threw out of it. She wasn't able to absorb the emotions of the scene
00:15:26 You know itself I really liked it
00:15:28 But yeah as a whole it was quite a jarring jump like I immediately saw the shift in animation
00:15:34 It was kind of weird. It took me out of the experience. Yeah, it does make you think of like
00:15:38 Okay, this is the part where the people making the cartoon really want to blow their load and make me feel something. Yes. Yeah
00:15:45 Like it I like the way James Baxter was used in adventure time because it's just he animates a horse because he's good at that
00:15:52 And it's a silly horse and you wouldn't even tell me who James Baxter is though because I don't know
00:15:56 I didn't look into him, but he's a guy who has worked for Disney's done a lot of like really good
00:16:03 animation for Disney and
00:16:05 recently oh
00:16:07 You know the bit in the Gravity Falls opening where Mabel is rubbing her cheek on the pig and it's really smooth
00:16:13 That's him. Yeah, the bit where
00:16:16 Scar and is like a fighting off with Simba at the end of the Lion King with it like a 360
00:16:22 Shot where he's like no scope around him. Three six. There's sixty no scope
00:16:30 Yeah, that was him dude. Yeah, and and he's like a
00:16:34 What's the the punchback of Notre Dame?
00:16:37 He's done a bunch of he does a lot of like really
00:16:40 Impressively animated motion scenes like yeah, the reason he did the thing with the
00:16:45 The white diamond in 3d like whoo like you just drew that because you can because he's good at that
00:16:50 What if right thinking thinking about scar a 360 no scoping Simba
00:16:56 Think what if like what if like voice actors, right?
00:17:00 Like like Jeremy iron like for example Jeremy irons just starts a twitch channel and just starts like streaming games as
00:17:09 Scar, but he's just like do that. I think yeah
00:17:12 Like not actual voice actors, but I kept being recommended like a few years ago
00:17:16 Like by a person who kept doing Fluttershy voice and pretending to be Fluttershy and just playing games
00:17:21 I've seen that the the the scout voice actor for TF2 has done that. Oh, yeah, that's cool
00:17:27 It's like the evolution of like an ask blog or something instead of like drawing this character
00:17:32 You're just are peeing him on on twitch
00:17:35 I'm not sure if he's streamed or recorded, but I heard like the voice actor for
00:17:40 One of the overwatch characters the high noon one. Oh, what's what's it the McCree? Yeah McCree McCree
00:17:45 Yeah, he he he would troll a fellow players and would just scream high noon in voice chat
00:17:54 So we play that was like just they'd be like oh shit. He's using his ult, but no it was in fact a ruse
00:17:59 Respect to them a lot more before I knew that he also plays the game
00:18:03 Yeah, let me tell me to maybe he only plays it to troll people who knows
00:18:08 So, okay, let's talk about the the the ramifications of this this Steven universe special
00:18:13 Because the big thing I saw a lot of people talking about it and I feel this to a degree as well is like
00:18:20 What is there even left to talk about now that this is done?
00:18:23 I'll just be able this is spoilers. So if you don't want to know fair enough skip ahead or whatever
00:18:27 It's done white diamond is redeemed. She's on our team now
00:18:32 Here's the most thing what I think because I'm way behind. I'm totally behind
00:18:38 Yeah, the last thing I saw was the white diamond reveal. Yeah, okay, fair enough. I mean that looks good still
00:18:45 So cool looking the thing with like all of Steven universe is like combat is part of it
00:18:50 But Steven is like as a person is always like I don't fight
00:18:56 Don't do it like a pink diamond would fight
00:18:59 She had a war going as like rose quartz, but Steven's like
00:19:05 Never and he has a shield and it's like, okay, so this is not really about like solving problems with violence
00:19:11 um
00:19:12 And I guess I guess the thing that happens next
00:19:16 after like white diamond is redeemed kind of or definitely is uh like
00:19:22 Changing home world like I think instead of having the climax be a slug fest
00:19:27 Which would go against like the the point of Steven as a character
00:19:31 It would be the finale would be you know changing the universe for the better making home world better
00:19:37 You know doing all this stuff because all they've done really is they've they've uh
00:19:42 Like what do they do? They got the gems that were like fucked up and they healed them
00:19:47 And then that's it
00:19:53 The cluster yeah, they've got to do something about the cluster
00:19:56 Or like turn it into a big giant guy
00:20:00 um me and byter joked that like
00:20:02 Because I heard that there might be a uh six season and we were like well
00:20:06 What are they gonna do because everything's so wrapped up?
00:20:08 And so we joked that like the whole six season is just just them separating and piecing back together the cluster
00:20:14 Every episode is basically them
00:20:16 And yes, it's minecraft it's minecraft you go in there with a little pickaxe you chunk chunk a bit off turn it into a guy
00:20:23 Keep going. Please fact check me people
00:20:25 But I believe what I heard was that we know there's a movie coming in I think September of this year
00:20:30 And I believe that there's also a sixth season. I that that's what I was
00:20:33 Yeah, that's the rumors I've heard, but I'm not sure if it's true
00:20:36 I don't know. I don't know if there's any like confirmation of anything other than the movie. Okay. Okay. The movie's for sure though
00:20:43 So let me just say my thoughts in general which are
00:20:46 That so I I never expected like I mean would I have liked a little more fighting? Sure never hurts
00:20:53 But I was satisfied with what we saw we finally saw I think it was was it obsidian the fusion of all of the
00:20:59 Obsidian was was it final we saw the four fused?
00:21:02 Dude, did you notice did you notice obsidian was the temple?
00:21:06 Yeah, I used the temple that was I was expecting it to be the temple because I I knew the moment stupid
00:21:12 I I heard that temple is like oh it has to be I'd heard that theorized on like way back like you remember like season one
00:21:19 Damn, I guess everyone was ahead ahead of the curve and I was the only one who was excited about that
00:21:24 I know I I liked it a lot too. I thought it was really good and I liked her coloring
00:21:27 That way though that was yeah black with lava under it and all that dude's stuff with a big old sword
00:21:33 That was it was dope. It looked really cool and I was very happy with it
00:21:36 It doesn't get to do very much, but you know that that's okay
00:21:39 And and like like we were saying the like emotional climax or the climax wasn't a big fight
00:21:45 It was literally Steven like talking to white diamond and convincing her to be a good boy
00:21:51 But but beyond that, um, I mean it was it was convincing white diamond that whatever like people are imperfect. Nobody's perfect
00:21:58 So you shouldn't be so
00:22:00 Strict on everyone like you have to accept people's imperfections like okay fair enough whatever
00:22:05 Yeah rarity if you just you just opened your heart a little bit you let people into your your worlds
00:22:11 We can help bear your burden. You don't have to be perfect all the time
00:22:15 Yes, and that was a good that was fine. That was fine. I have some today. I learned that i'm steven
00:22:21 Well, let's just let's before we get to that. Let's just say that so when when white diamond she she she fucking kills everybody else
00:22:28 It's only uh, steven left. She fucking pulls the diamond out of his stomach
00:22:34 She pulls it. She rips it the fuck out and he's gotten up and there's blood everywhere deeply horrific
00:22:40 He was freaking out on dying
00:22:42 Out after she pulled it out. It was uh, it was fucking that was that was the um, okay
00:22:47 Can I can I say that i'm kind of disappointed with corny or rather how she was uh
00:22:53 useless
00:22:55 I'm over conny man
00:22:57 I was I was hoping when she entered the temple and every and and all the gems were getting zapped of their color and stuff
00:23:02 And it was like oh well conny's a human she won't get that maybe she could do something
00:23:06 And no she immediately gets caught like she has like a small battle, but that does nothing and then gets caught
00:23:12 It's like well, what's the point of you being here?
00:23:14 Yeah, that was a weird build up or nothing to happen like the whole conny thing like oh, it's cool
00:23:19 That steven confused with her and he becomes tall then the sword looks the right size
00:23:24 And the and the shield is in his other hand and he rides line or she
00:23:29 Schlier schlay or schler rides lion
00:23:32 And it's like oh the coolest like that's the final battle mode, but conny was just there
00:23:37 And she didn't do that
00:23:39 I don't know why I kind of built her up. It's like oh she learned how to fight and and stuff. Well, what's the
00:23:45 Okay, okay. Let me just get into my point here. Okay, so everything about steven universe every single conflict has been predicated on
00:23:53 The fact that they're what there's okay
00:23:55 What why do people fight in the real world people fight in the real world because they want things from each other
00:24:01 And like they can't just get it given to them instantly
00:24:04 They have to take it by force and they like they can't come to a compromise or they just don't care to
00:24:09 That's why people fight in the real world at all. So okay. Why are they fighting in steven universe?
00:24:14 They're fighting because like white diamond insists that like humans are shitty. I don't care about them like they're worthless
00:24:22 Gem life is good. We're going to spread gem life and whoever gets in our way including humans
00:24:26 Like we will fuck them up including like the you know the the crystal gems who fought back
00:24:30 They had to fucking destroy them because they were getting in their way. So this all makes sense
00:24:34 um
00:24:34 As to why why they're doing it. They don't recognize like the importance of the fucking differences of what makes them special
00:24:40 So when so white diamond is convinced finally that that is not the case by the big emotional climax
00:24:46 Where she rips out the gem from steven and the gem itself of pink diamond like she was expecting to just become actually
00:24:53 With me and michelle were thing was that oh now we're going to get steven and rose quartz. She's not even dead
00:24:57 She's just coming back. This is going to suck
00:24:59 But no the the the pink diamond itself had been changed by the existence of steven
00:25:06 We thought she was back
00:25:07 But uh it like so pink diamond really is permanently gone even having to remove the gem from steven
00:25:14 And it like its nature has been changed and now it's like it's a weird pink steven thing
00:25:18 And then it refuses with his body. It's a big emotional thing. Yay. I'm myself again. Okay, that's fine
00:25:23 So so what I just want to cut in just before you get to that that bit. Why why was uh pink steven the diamond
00:25:31 Had no emotion at all like the other diamonds have emotion. I don't really understand what that means
00:25:37 Well, I mean, okay, so that was a blank face pink steven
00:25:42 I mean, I mean was it really with no emotion because it yelled really loud that one time that seemed like something was going on with it
00:25:48 Uh, I just think it was a weird like
00:25:51 It was it was a weird like
00:25:53 Like choice to have it be so
00:25:57 Because like what else are you supposed to take away from that other than he has no emotion?
00:26:01 No, no, I think it was just sort of a shorthand to say it to show that it's incomplete without steven
00:26:07 Like two two halves of the same thing
00:26:10 And that's why when steven got happy. So did the pink steven got happy. They all got in sync
00:26:17 Yeah, I think I think that's right brain left brain. I think uh
00:26:20 The episode was kind of shit on the whole. Yeah, the more I think about it
00:26:26 um, because uh
00:26:28 Like a lot of a lot of the the dialogue and ideas in this episode seemed like like weirdly on the nose even for steven universe
00:26:36 like
00:26:38 It felt like like all the criticism
00:26:40 That people have given the show like how it like shoves like it's lgbt thing down people's throats
00:26:46 it it felt like
00:26:48 They heard the criticism and then doubled down on all of it
00:26:52 For this well, there's no way that we change that shit. That's what the show. No, I know they're not going to change it
00:26:57 And I've never really had a problem with it. I've been a stalwart steven universe defender
00:27:01 But some of the dialogue in this episode was like excruciatingly on the nose
00:27:06 Like when they go she prefers to be called steven now and it's like just shut off. Yeah, I know top
00:27:13 And there was a bunch and like they're like the part we're fucking the
00:27:17 The steven and garnet fusion
00:27:19 Sunstone, I think like breaks the fourth wall
00:27:23 Looks at the camera and says remember kids if you are dealing with a bully tell an adult
00:27:29 What the fuck was that that was horrible?
00:27:32 I don't I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I could character
00:27:36 It was a joke, but I don't get the joke like I really don't I can't understand what the joke is that literally that literally happened
00:27:43 What steven fused with garnet and made a new gem sunstone
00:27:48 Sunstone was like oh, she's wacky and like she says her and then she goes to the camera. She breaks the fourth wall
00:27:55 So like oh her joke is that she's
00:27:59 She's dead. She she breaks the fourth wall
00:28:02 And she says she says after school
00:28:05 I mean, I guess like commercial if they hit. Oh my god. Sunstone is fucking awesome
00:28:10 It looks great, but god damn like if they had done that bit if they had done that bit twice
00:28:17 Then I would have accepted it like okay. It's like her thing. Maybe it's because
00:28:21 Sapphire is in there somewhere. She's like aware of things
00:28:24 But like because they only did it once it was so insanely jarring and weird
00:28:29 Like she's just giving this like they're literally fighting first of all
00:28:33 And then in the middle of a of the fight like she's going. I'm gonna beat you up
00:28:37 I'm gonna beat up white diamond and then looks at the camera and goes but kids if you have a bully tell an adult
00:28:43 And like I wanted to shit. I just wanted to empty my bowels
00:28:47 in an instant
00:28:49 and uh this whole like arc of like
00:28:53 Of steven being there and being forced into the role of pink diamond
00:28:57 like
00:28:58 Like again, everyone is criticized to show a lot for a long time and I've always defended it
00:29:03 But this arc like right when he gets in the pink diamond outfit. That was the moment where I finally went
00:29:09 This is gay
00:29:12 This is gay. It's like he's just like he's in this like really to to with his midriff exposed for like four
00:29:18 entire episodes and like I'm not
00:29:21 Like I'm not being close-minded. I'm not offended by it. I don't know. I didn't mind that at all
00:29:25 It's just so fucking lame. I mean, I'm still looking at the wiki. I can't fucking believe how cool sunstone is
00:29:32 It's awesome. All right
00:29:34 You know, we're fucking angry
00:29:37 That thing with sunstone when she looked at the camera was
00:29:40 particularly like annoying
00:29:42 Uh, I was totally blind and that was just like oh just that was like them just like planting a sign like editing
00:29:49 Like a still image onto the middle of the episode and it wasn't in character wasn't anything
00:29:53 It's just like by the way, like we support children not being bullied
00:29:57 Just please call this number in the real world
00:30:01 It just doesn't make sense because sunstone isn't is way smaller than this giant robot. She's not bullying the giant robot
00:30:07 I don't understand what is yeah, but but that thing was the bully right like that thing was bullying them
00:30:12 Like the whole like I just don't get like why this episode like as the finale was so like weirdly
00:30:18 On the nose and in your face and like obnoxiously like
00:30:22 um
00:30:22 It felt like they were not subtle at all ticking books is like oh, we haven't seen Steven and pearl fuse got to do that
00:30:28 Steven that's true. They were trying to like really
00:30:31 Cramming all the different themes of the show all at once in this episode and throw them at you with no subtlety to them at all
00:30:37 like um
00:30:38 The part where it's just the the the finale fan service
00:30:44 Yeah, yeah, but like
00:30:46 The best part of Steven universe is like
00:30:49 Getting to know the care like really getting into them like I think like one of the best episodes is
00:30:55 Mr. Greg
00:30:56 where
00:30:58 You like
00:30:59 Get an idea of like any pearl episode is great because like she's kind of the most rich character, I think
00:31:04 But like delving into like her insecurities and stuff
00:31:08 But in this episode there was a moment where
00:31:11 White diamonds starts running down the crystal gems and she just like flat out says
00:31:17 Uh, your flaw garnet is that you're fucking
00:31:20 Retarded and your flaw pearl is that you're insecure and your flaw amethyst. No
00:31:26 Your flaw amethyst is you're insecure and your flaw pearl is that you're obsessed and it's like
00:31:33 It was better when you like stating yeah, like the the characters seem so much more three-dimensional when you
00:31:39 Like are seeing that instead of like it's really weird for a character
00:31:43 To just like it's kind of like another break in the fourth wall thing almost where the characters just yeah
00:31:48 This is who you are as a character pearl and this is who you are as a character garnet and this is why you
00:31:54 Gathered yet. These are the flaws
00:31:58 How does white diamond even know that?
00:32:01 Yeah, that's also a good. Did she say that did she did she say she said she she said like
00:32:06 As she was zapping them and turning them gray like oh, you're all flawed
00:32:10 You know and she said like the word obsessed to pearl and insecure
00:32:14 I forget what she said to garnet, but was was did we was it confirmed that pearl was white diamonds pearl?
00:32:20 That's still not confirmed and it's infuriating. Yes. Just confirm it for me god damn it. Well, well white diamond would have met pearl
00:32:28 Plausibly, but she wouldn't know anything about amethyst, right?
00:32:31 Well
00:32:34 Because she kind of brain washes them
00:32:36 I think she has some sort of way of getting into their minds and knowing
00:32:40 That's it's it's revealed that
00:32:43 um white diamonds pearl
00:32:45 is pink diamonds pearl
00:32:47 Because she turns pink at the right
00:32:49 so
00:32:50 Like and and there was that line in an episode a long time ago where jasper says something about you being a defective pearl
00:32:57 so
00:32:58 My theory is that our pearl
00:33:01 Like at some point pink diamond fucked up and pissed off white diamond
00:33:05 So white diamond took pink pearls pearl
00:33:09 And said this is my white pearl now and then like
00:33:12 Pawn and like gave pink diamond like a crappier like an off-color
00:33:16 Defective pearl which is why our pearl is not pink as she like logically should be she's just pearl colored
00:33:24 That's so I think that our pearl was a replacement pearl for pink diamond after losing her original pearl
00:33:30 to white diamond. Yeah, most likely
00:33:33 All I'm saying is if it is in fact revealed as I personally suspect that our pearl just was straight up white diamonds pearl
00:33:40 Although like are there more than four pearls in the universe? I would imagine so, right?
00:33:44 Um, but anyway, like assuming that our pearl was white diamonds pearl
00:33:49 There are many many many times when it would have been relevant for for our white ish pearl to say by the way guys
00:33:55 I was white diamonds pearl. I have some information about her
00:33:58 I can like tell you some info on her, but she has not done that which is weird if she is in fact her pearl
00:34:04 I don't think I don't think I don't think she was white diamonds pearl
00:34:07 I think she was just like a literally a defective off-color. Yeah, like a spare piece of shit
00:34:12 Okay, I'll just say for the record. She would have been destroyed because there's no tall there's zero
00:34:16 Zero tolerance. I guess that's also true. That's true. That's well. Never mind. It makes no sense. It's stupid then
00:34:21 I'll point out just for the record that so every pearl has their pearl on the same place on their body as their
00:34:28 Corresponding diamond and white pearl or our pearl does in fact have a forehead pearl just like white diamond as a forehead diamond
00:34:35 So it seems well likely that they are in sync, but again not confirmed yet
00:34:39 Maybe she was uh cursed to not be able to say anything
00:34:44 Like I mean that is established that that is a thing that happens. So one thing about the episode that I did really appreciate
00:34:50 Is that a pearl pearl our pearl the real pearl
00:34:55 Has now permanent cool jacket
00:34:59 That's true big old shoulders
00:35:02 Yeah, so now she now she can dress up now. She can drive around and fuck that less and I like that because
00:35:08 Finally, I like that because you know every time that they regenerate they their outfits do change
00:35:14 But this is the first time that it's looked like to me or seemed like
00:35:18 The physical change is like a tangible manifestation of actual character development because that episode where she wore the jacket
00:35:26 Was an episode where she actually developed as a character. So now that she has a jacket as part of her
00:35:31 Permanent look. It feels like sick
00:35:34 Is the jacket is cool. Peridot has prominent glasses that she doesn't deserve and dead
00:35:40 And also and also a fucking
00:35:43 Peridot has come in a glasses. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's she's the one she's the one and garnet they both
00:35:50 Oh
00:35:53 Garden has like Simone glasses, I guess
00:35:56 And uh and uh fucking lapis has like a lad pants now
00:36:02 for some reason
00:36:04 God damn it lapis. You looked way better before go back to your dress. What what what what what's the deal with lapis
00:36:10 What the heck is she and why lapis is the worst character in the show
00:36:15 She's so she's so strange and I don't I still don't really understand who she is
00:36:19 Agreed me too. And that's a problem
00:36:22 I kind of like her lapis, but that's the thing is I can't describe why
00:36:27 It's like she vaguely depressed and confusing. I wanted to like her. She looked she looked really cool
00:36:32 I I was I was on board like when I first saw her I was like oh lapis. Oh cool
00:36:36 Uh, it was just sad. Nope. Nobody else on the show is sad. I'm into it
00:36:41 She was just written like a bit different a few too many times
00:36:45 I don't even feel like lapis should be a crystal gem
00:36:49 I just feel like because she was a character design that like had been in the show. They're like, we got one
00:36:54 Let's bring her into this because like I felt like she was just a one-off
00:36:58 Like side character, but then she gets all wrapped up and
00:37:02 She's so weirdly outside the the circle of what I consider the real crystal gems
00:37:07 Which includes paradox, but it does not include lapis and it does not include bismuth either
00:37:12 I don't like that character. No, it does not. I don't she should go away. Also guys, did you
00:37:17 When they all fuse into like obsidian or whatever
00:37:20 Notably, they just are like, we're let's just not use with bismuth. Let's like she we don't want her like mixed up in our
00:37:27 Like obsidian thing. Why why didn't they do it?
00:37:30 You know when I I looked up obsidian and like she she's like a lava creature and she like forges her greats
00:37:37 Out of like the lava in her third mouth, which is fucking awesome. So I saw that I assumed that bismuth was in there, but no
00:37:43 No, no, no, they just
00:37:46 You would think that would be bismuth's bag
00:37:48 I mean, maybe there's an easy answer to this but like like so the temple has like five gems or whatever for the five crystal gems, you know,
00:37:55 whatever
00:37:57 diamond rose quartz
00:37:59 Amethyst a garnet who is two gems and then pearl like how can bismuth didn't have a room?
00:38:04 What's up with that? She was there. Did she maybe they built that up before they made it? Yeah, afterward. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's fair
00:38:10 I guess that's fair. Okay. Well whatever
00:38:14 Is the worst
00:38:16 Yeah, she sucks
00:38:19 We all agree on it. I just don't like it
00:38:22 The thing with bismuth
00:38:24 Is that like I was talking about this with some some art people and they were like really annoyed about how
00:38:31 Boring and terrible her character design is when the gem bismuth is the coolest looking gem in the world
00:38:37 Yeah, like she's just got sort of like kind of colorful dreadlocks
00:38:42 And it should be it should be like a wild like super rainbow
00:38:46 Cool like angular hair and it's just some lady with dreadlocks
00:38:50 And I don't know she's like the most bloodthirsty of them all but she doesn't like do anything with that
00:38:54 She's kind of boring and she's fat
00:38:57 Yeah
00:39:00 I don't care for it
00:39:03 Yeah, I guess so were those uh one of those really good designs
00:39:05 Like at the end when when all those gems are getting reformed so many cool little designs are like weirdly vaguely humanoid
00:39:12 Are just really neat
00:39:14 That was one of the best parts of the show just watching them all being uh reformed and being able to guess like oh
00:39:18 What gem do you think that one might be?
00:39:20 Hey, do you remember the the chip sky from the very first episode the one that likes
00:39:24 Yep centipede man centipede
00:39:28 It's like the cutest one. I loved her
00:39:31 She's I do like I do like her and then jasper was there. I forgot that jasper was bubbled and then there she is
00:39:37 Bubbled and fucked up permanently uh with troll horns. They're they're saying she's a troll now you guys
00:39:43 Oh no
00:39:45 Yeah, they got they got back the friends that they mentioned like I don't remember what the names were but like they mentioned those friends
00:39:52 And they were like, oh no, they're gone. They're corrupted and they got them back and bismuth pounced. You know, okay
00:39:56 You know what I'd like to see I'd like to see all right
00:40:00 This maybe this has nothing to do with anything
00:40:03 But imagine off on homeworld they got like babies
00:40:06 But they're coal so like coal babies and you crush them into different gems. That's how they make them
00:40:13 You put a baby in the crushing machine. It comes out
00:40:15 Let
00:40:19 Okay, on the subject of saving all the corrupted gems at the end. Let's talk about like consequences
00:40:26 For white diamonds genocidal campaign throughout the stars that the other diamonds that by the way, nobody even cares about like blue diamond and yellow diamond
00:40:34 absolutely
00:40:35 Uh participants in these genocide crusades. Um, let's okay. What have they done as part of their galactic uh conquering empire
00:40:43 They have 100 destroyed planets wiped out populations
00:40:48 Mind all the resources in like an expunged all life plant or otherwise from planets
00:40:53 And we can only speculate as to how many planets this was done to many many systems many many planets. Um
00:41:00 Okay, yellow did say like thousands didn't she thousands? Yeah, I think so
00:41:05 I'm not I'm not too sure but yeah, she mentions a large
00:41:08 And now so big dick Steven slams his cock on the table in front of white diamond and says
00:41:16 It ain't gonna suck itself
00:41:18 Stop being evil. You're good now and white diamond says okay
00:41:22 And whatever she learns that it's okay to be flawed. I guess that means, you know
00:41:26 I look I get the whole I get what they're trying to say socially in the in the meta text of that message
00:41:30 What I don't understand is how that's in any way a sufficient apology
00:41:35 For the genocides that white diamond and her and her cabal have committed across the universe
00:41:41 And how it's just okay for them to literally come to earth and say like hey guys, we're here. We're good now
00:41:47 How is that?
00:41:48 Acceptable. There are some crimes that you cannot be forgiven for and I think they've crossed the threshold
00:41:54 If they're doing more episodes that might be addressed
00:41:57 Okay, let let me finish one point though on this and it's it's just that okay. I am I do not believe in like, uh, like
00:42:04 What's the word?
00:42:05 Like repudiation justice like like punishment justice
00:42:09 If someone has if you've got a thief and he steals a loaf of bread and like okay, maybe the punishment for that is chop
00:42:14 Off his hand. Okay, like that's not gonna help anybody if you could instead
00:42:18 Explain to this guy why what he did was wrong and he could make it up to the person he stole from
00:42:22 And like he doesn't need to do any jail time or even be punished at all
00:42:25 He just needs to sincerely change his behavior like that's obviously what we want
00:42:29 So if white diamond has been like redeemed then like okay
00:42:33 I'm willing to accept that like maybe it's not even doesn't even make sense to punish white diamond for this
00:42:39 But they don't talk about that what I think is that literally white diamond is too important to jail
00:42:45 Because she and it's it's literally only her political and actual physical
00:42:50 Might that prevents us from even thinking like oh this person should be in jail
00:42:54 Just like we do with big bankers in the real world
00:42:56 We're like obviously, you know, it's fine that they're not in jail. They're important
00:43:00 Like a president just can commit war crimes because like I don't know. He's the president. That's fine. And uh, I just feel like we're using some weird
00:43:09 Systems to judge these guys
00:43:11 Shouldn't we be more mad shouldn't the characters be more mad about what's going on?
00:43:15 um any comments here, I don't know I
00:43:18 What on the one hand? Yes, they should be more mad. I guess but I think they're just more relieved that
00:43:25 They they have stopped her from destroying everything and so they're just getting caught up in like
00:43:31 Ah victory, you know, we did it. We've solved the problem for now
00:43:35 And then you know, they they can sit on the beach with a ukulele and play a little little song
00:43:40 Like for one second
00:43:44 That's fair, but okay, there's a couple of issues still at play them. Okay, it's
00:43:48 So what we are led to believe about white diamonds redemption
00:43:52 Is that it was that white diamond was a perfectionist and she like okay
00:43:56 She was literally like a bigot against like uh, and I understand what all this represents the real world like okay
00:44:03 White diamond thinks that fusing is icky. Why does white diamond think that fusing is icky? I don't know tradition
00:44:10 It's it's new and different and weird. It's the purity. It's not pure or something like oh, okay
00:44:16 Yeah, it relates to off color something like okay, that's fine like obviously that's just something that should go away
00:44:21 There's nothing really wrong about that
00:44:24 Like uh, I'm not someone in the real world who thinks that all traditions are necessarily worthless
00:44:29 But I'm happy to examine any of them and you know toss out the shit and keep only the good stuff
00:44:34 So this is one that doesn't seem to make a lot of fucking sense
00:44:36 And you're literally way more powerful if you fuse anyway, so wake up white diamond. Stop limiting yourself
00:44:41 I was almost hoping to see a blue and yellow diamond fusion
00:44:46 I wanted to see stuff like that
00:44:47 Dude, they gotta like it's okay that they've got a gay son now
00:44:50 But they're gonna have to work up to actually trying any gayness out themselves
00:44:53 What if all four of them fuse and they become big diamond?
00:44:59 Big diamond big big big big diamond
00:45:05 Um, okay, okay, so that's all that's all fine. I get what they're trying to say
00:45:10 But here's the thing and this is okay. This this is a moral for babies and like okay. That's fine
00:45:15 A galactic genocider with a big diamond on his head when you've got a galactic genocider
00:45:23 Most people who commit galactic genocide
00:45:27 Are not they didn't just like fall into this position. We all know one
00:45:32 Okay, all right
00:45:33 Like I'm trying to really take the story and give it all the credit that it's due like okay
00:45:37 Why was hitler like a bad man?
00:45:39 Uh, probably things like he was he was poisoned uh into thinking that like the world was persecuting the german people
00:45:45 After their experiences after world war one like he had had I think personal run-ins with jews that made him hate them
00:45:51 And make them think they'd be a great scapegoat. Okay, like fine
00:45:54 So he he had like some baggage that made him an evil guy understandable
00:45:58 Like what makes white diamond like an evil person uh one she like wasn't accepting of like new thoughts and
00:46:04 You know what people wanted to do with their lives
00:46:06 Um, but also let's not forget the fact that homeworld is literally falling apart
00:46:11 We we see homeworld and it's like being destroyed
00:46:14 I was kind of under the impression. Okay. This is this is how you write steven universe in like a like
00:46:19 I'm not even saying it's better, but like a
00:46:22 A more realistic thing
00:46:24 It's a thing where like what what I was hoping white diamond would argue and this didn't happen at all was like, okay
00:46:29 I'm white diamond the reason that I'm so strict in everyone is because homeworld is literally falling apart
00:46:35 Like our society is crumbling right now
00:46:38 The way that I maintain structure and order for like all my billions and trillions of like children that are like my
00:46:44 Under my command and like they're my responsibility is I impose these rigid social structures
00:46:50 To like keep things in line so that things don't like spiral off like they did when I gave pink diamond too much leeway
00:46:55 And it caused that whole crystal gem shit and then we had to go mop up that
00:46:59 Like people don't just become a dictator for like no reason they do it because they
00:47:03 Generally either think that it's for the best whether they're right or wrong
00:47:08 Or like they they just crave power and they find whatever way they can get it
00:47:12 If white diamond just crave power she would be evil and they would like have to fight her
00:47:16 So obviously they weren't going to do that
00:47:18 so
00:47:18 Like I just think it would have been way more
00:47:21 interesting of a of a story if they deal with what like actual dictators do
00:47:26 And it's a thing where like she like this is just the way that she
00:47:29 Controls her society and makes sure that I don't know it runs fucking smoothly
00:47:33 But like that and and then it would be harder to convince her
00:47:37 But no, it's just that oh, I just like I have just this purity thing
00:47:40 Like oh like but then she sees oh wait, I have emotions sometimes too. Even I'm not perfect
00:47:45 Maybe I can allow these people to be different
00:47:48 Well, I I I'm wondering about that because like they blue and yellow we're talking about you know
00:47:54 Oh, do you remember white diamond when we used to have fun picnics and we were all happy friends and like
00:48:00 They didn't necessarily mention a thing that changed
00:48:04 That's like I feel like there is a thing that would have changed like oh
00:48:08 And then the event happened
00:48:09 But we don't speak of that event was was the pink diamond
00:48:13 Well pink diamonds quote-unquote death or like the crystal gem rebellion
00:48:17 I like because they say that before pink left like they used to have fun together
00:48:21 And it's that's the only notable event like in gem history that we're aware of so it's kind of a guess
00:48:26 But it seems fairly reasonable. I think
00:48:28 Um that like something about pink diamond leaving and like quote-unquote
00:48:33 Well, I guess being murdered and like gems betraying them in their eyes. Anyway, maybe it just made white diamond think of like
00:48:38 Maybe this plays into what I was saying it like ah when I give them too much freedom bad things happen
00:48:43 So let's fucking you know, even tighter than before it could be that or it could just be the like
00:48:49 White kept pink around and didn't let her go on
00:48:52 Uh, you know taking over a planet missions
00:48:56 um
00:48:57 Because she liked having her around and when she was gone. She just sort of well, it's it's weird
00:49:01 We just don't know enough about white diamond
00:49:03 I'm imagining that they were all younger and like white diamond was the eldest and so she took up the mantle of being perfect
00:49:09 So that she could set a good example
00:49:11 There was like a line or two. I don't remember what the lines were but it was
00:49:16 The white diamond said and because of that I assumed for a split second that like
00:49:21 Pink diamond and maybe the other diamonds other color diamonds are kind of like parts of white diamond that got separated from white diamond
00:49:29 So she could be perfect
00:49:30 Let's talk about that because that was a little confusing and I was also wondering about that white diamond does say that like
00:49:36 She doesn't say things like literally she says that like blue diamond yellow
00:49:40 Like are part of her and that pink is also part of her. I think that was more metaphorical
00:49:46 In the sense of like they are aspects of myself
00:49:49 Like emotionally, but I like like whatever blue is like sad and I white could be sad
00:49:55 But I like control that in myself yellow is I don't I don't even know what you're angry
00:50:00 Angry and I you know repress that in myself. I'm just I'm calm all the time
00:50:05 And then and then like the thing that happens to me
00:50:08 Isn't yellow diamond isn't yellow diamond all about having no emotions like
00:50:12 No, she's actually pretty
00:50:15 Well, okay, okay
00:50:16 Yeah, but remember there was that episode with peridot
00:50:19 We're like she like she loves yellow diamond
00:50:22 But then she talks to yellow diamond and she sees that yellow diamond isn't as like perfect
00:50:26 Like she sees yellow diamond get mad on the communicator and she's like, huh?
00:50:30 She's not as cool as I thought she was she's not perfectly logical after all
00:50:33 Well, I guess I well white diamond does attempt to make everybody like logical and not
00:50:38 Overly emotional I guess but I suppose yellow attempts to do that
00:50:42 But you know isn't as good as uh as white diamond yellow is trying to follow white
00:50:48 Orders to the tea, you know, she's she did say like I I did everything and did everything perfectly in your name because you requested it
00:50:55 So she's sort of like trying to be like white diamond, but she's obviously not why I'm I'm still wondering
00:51:01 We this has not been addressed or even close to answered. Where did the diamonds come from?
00:51:06 What is the origin of the gem civilization to begin with the coal babies they started as the coal babies you get crushed by
00:51:14 um, you know, I don't even I don't even really minecraft steve
00:51:17 and his and his galactic
00:51:20 Craft and bench. Well, I don't even need like a real answer
00:51:23 The only reason I ask is because I literally want to know more about white diamonds backstory as a character
00:51:28 Like that's why I'm asking not because I I need all the lore all the fucking time
00:51:33 But like uh, so so in in in various things up to this point at the end of the special
00:51:38 We see a preview for the movie and there appears to be a red gem
00:51:42 Like rotating and and people theorize. Maybe that's red diamond
00:51:46 Like maybe this person is the one even above white diamond. Maybe this person is the real origin of everything
00:51:51 Or maybe it's just a split off diamond all the way or maybe they're not a diamond at all. I mean, who knows who knows
00:51:57 Um, could be anything could be diamonds all the way up
00:52:00 diamonds all the way down
00:52:02 And uh, like so so I guess I'm just gonna say that so so far I'm not really uh
00:52:10 It's not that I'm not satisfied with the story. It's just that oh
00:52:12 I have unfortunately recognized that this story's moral is just something that I kind of already know
00:52:18 And isn't really for my age demographic and that's fine. It's just unfortunate. So it's not that it's like bad
00:52:26 It's just the the thing I'm most interested in they don't really want to touch on and that's okay
00:52:32 It's just a different story. I guess then from what I want
00:52:34 But maybe with the movie and this possible next season there will be some of that because because just to be clear
00:52:40 Steven universe is actually like the only show that I go back to and just watch episodes from randomly
00:52:46 Because I just really enjoy the atmosphere and those queers can make a goddamn show when they put their mind to it
00:52:53 And make a comfy-ass atmosphere and I really like it
00:52:56 Uh, so this is not I'm not even trying to be that critical of the show
00:53:00 It's just when it when it comes to like intergalactic conflict and like the origin
00:53:05 Of like why civilizations act the way they do that's when my star fleet senses start to tingle and I get a little excited
00:53:12 Who would have thought that this show that I value so much for its comfy down-to-earth atmosphere would would would
00:53:18 Stumble out of the gate when it comes to intergalactic politics
00:53:22 And war crimes. Well, I mean that's the time when like, you know, they can expand the scope a little of that choose
00:53:27 And they chose not to and that's okay
00:53:29 But yeah, yeah, that's it. That's all I got. I want to fuck pearl
00:53:35 I want to check out her pants. I want her to regenerate with no pants on. I want to fuck her
00:53:45 It's me the best character in the show the guy who fucks him
00:53:51 That's my name. I guess that's the guy who fucks him
00:53:54 Greg's my Greg's my name, but the guy who fucks him is my middle name
00:54:00 Fuck a mom the pussy. I think we've confirmed that Greg literally did just come on her gem
00:54:07 And it butted off into some kind of steven growth. I think that's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard
00:54:13 There can be no other
00:54:15 Do you see like a do you see like a like a zoom down like a house like a house?
00:54:20 Kind of like style like zoom in by into the body biological close-up and you see his no absolutely not
00:54:27 Okay, just one other solution could there be nothing nothing
00:54:32 Um, I guess that's it. I mean so september's the movie. Uh, I don't know
00:54:36 I there was actually some pretty mixed feelings here on how things are going. Um
00:54:41 Yeah, I don't know. I I still like steven universe a lot and I'm looking forward to more
00:54:45 Um, I should probably catch up. I want to see more white diamonds. I want to see sunstone
00:54:50 Cool-looking. Yeah, and she got some great animation and uh
00:54:53 She's got a cool star cloak with all kinds of cool stuff in it. I'm so fucking cool. You guys
00:54:58 Yeah, I want to fuck her. I want to stick it in her fucking
00:55:04 hole
00:55:12 If you okay, if you came on white diamonds, uh diamond, would it grow like a white steven universe?
00:55:20 Is like that what you would get same with you know bluey and yellow. Would it be the same sort of thing?
00:55:26 I think they would have to do it on they would have to decide
00:55:29 Like only if they wanted it to happen. Yeah, you can't do it by accident doctor. Help me
00:55:35 I cut my cock on a diamond cunt
00:55:38 What if what if it does happen and they don't have to opt in like what if it's like semen is just to a gem as like
00:55:44 Water is to the wicked witch of the west. Yeah
00:55:47 Like you confirmed that pink had to grow grow a womb
00:55:51 To actually I mean she did have a womb. We saw her like pregnant with steven
00:55:54 There was a thing I refuse to believe that the gems don't have vaginas and I meet you
00:56:01 They have to be able to fuck it's the like I think like because it's a whole episode like one of the earliest episodes
00:56:08 When steven tries to fuck amethyst that was a crazy. That was a big life lesson for me the earliest episodes
00:56:14 Pearl has that line where she's like I don't like eating because I don't like digesting. It's gross
00:56:18 Which confirms for me that they got you know pearl's been around a long time. She's like a million thousand years old
00:56:24 Right. She's so you know, she's but she's done things. She's pooped
00:56:27 She's peed and she's probably been porked a few times that sex and didn't her like it rose quartz
00:56:33 Absolutely requested and enforced and demanded that pearl develop a vagina for her pleasure
00:56:39 I have no doubt that happened
00:56:42 In real I think she went even further than that. I think I think that she is a definite degenerate
00:56:47 I think that she gave the order
00:56:49 She said pearl go out there and find male human boys and men and fuck them so that you know what people are like
00:56:57 You gotta go fuck them
00:56:58 Holy shit, you know those like you know those like saudi arabian and you gotta eat food and you gotta poop it out your shitter
00:57:04 Well, yeah, that that's my order. I'm that's an order from your fucking
00:57:08 Fucking diamond. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so wise diamond
00:57:12 And she had to do it. She had to do it
00:57:15 She had to go get fucked. She had to go shit and pee and she didn't like any of it. She didn't like it
00:57:20 She's like sitting on the toilet just sitting and she's just looking up out the window teary. I had like oh great time
00:57:26 And what what is your what is your plan? What is your life almost a shit? I can never stop wiping the wiping never stops
00:57:33 Oh, it all coming back together. We have to get off of it
00:57:37 Wiping so yeah, so this is steven universe episode four now
00:57:42 Uh, I think this is three universe. Isn't this our third one? It's only three. I think so
00:57:46 I think this has got to be at least three and a half
00:57:50 Well, okay, I'm glad that I'm glad that I was able to make that wiping tirade come back and have a purpose later in the podcast
00:57:58 Me too. Uh, we did not get any steven universe voicemails. Thank god
00:58:02 Do we want to talk about anything else or should we just go to voicemails?
00:58:05 And this has been steven. Oh man. If people aren't talking about pearl poop, and then I don't want to hear it
00:58:14 We need we need a we need a new top we need something to jostle us out of the steven universe rut where I say voicemails. Let's do that
00:58:20 Um, how many do you have? Here's a uh news fact news fact a relevant thing
00:58:26 By this the time this episode comes out
00:58:29 Uh kingdom hearts 3 will be out in the real world. It will be released. It's already out in japan right now
00:58:36 Uh, and people have copies because some people are just getting it early finally something gayer than steven universe
00:58:43 To satiate my lust for homo bullshit
00:58:48 I'm happy to say that nobody has even attempted to spoil me on things which is very nice
00:58:52 Um, and by the time they hear this it's going to be too late. So you can't even do it now motherfucker
00:58:56 I'm gonna be cock deep in that game by this point. Uh, maybe I'll take some time off work
00:59:01 I don't know. I might uh, I might call out sick
00:59:03 mischievously for a day or two. Oh you rascal. I'm such a rascal. Um
00:59:08 I don't know. Maybe I maybe you're just putting a day. I don't know
00:59:11 The point is I'm going to be playing a lot of fucking kingdom hearts
00:59:13 And uh, I just want to take a moment on on our platform here on the procrastinators
00:59:18 And uh, please play uh the the fucking main theme of titanic in the background
00:59:23 No one uh, just to play it in your mind ladies and gentlemen as uh, we recognize the friends we lost along the way
00:59:29 By that I mean the people who used to care about kingdom hearts, but are completely fucking out of it
00:59:34 I have several friends who said they would buy a ps3
00:59:39 Specifically for kingdom hearts 3 when it inevitably came out on the ps3
00:59:44 And we are like we are like a year or two away from the ps5 right now. It's it's right around the corner
00:59:50 Um, it's been but they they man, they did it. It's been 13 years
00:59:55 13 just for the meme and at a certain point they were like okay for the past 10 years
01:00:00 Let's just go to the meme. Let's make the meme happen here
01:00:02 Uh, and I guess they did it, but uh, there's no way that's a coincidence, right? That has to be intentional
01:00:10 I I can I god. I hope so
01:00:12 Well, I don't know. I obviously I haven't played the game yet. I've been avoiding it. I just thought that uh
01:00:18 Man, I don't know. I just fucking say how fucking crazy it is
01:00:22 That and you know what this game is way more important than final fantasy 15
01:00:27 Um, because I mean whatever I played 15 didn't love it very much
01:00:31 Uh, but but this game is an actual real continuation of the same story that I started playing when I was like 11
01:00:38 And I feel I haven't played a kingdom hearts game since uh since chain of memories
01:00:45 But you haven't played two. You never played two. Well, oh wait. No two was after okay. Yeah, then two
01:00:50 I guess then two I haven't played a game. I haven't played a game since two
01:00:54 My my child self is screaming at me. You gotta play three
01:00:58 But like I haven't played any of the other games in between would I I mean, I'm gonna play it and I haven't played any of those
01:01:04 games. I don't forgive you shit. I
01:01:07 probably
01:01:08 I mean, I don't have
01:01:09 Well, I think I have a ps4. I mean, I have no hope or delusions that the story matters in kingdom hearts at all
01:01:17 I basically feel I mean like the the the part of the kingdom heart story that matters is like the emotional part of it
01:01:23 Like in the first game
01:01:25 He's just trying to get back to his friends and in the second game
01:01:27 He's still trying to get back to his friends in the third game, you know, and probably still I don't fucking know
01:01:33 That's the part that matters. Everything else is just just bullshit
01:01:37 Kingdom hearts too. I mean, yeah, they could have ended it at kingdom hearts too and just it was a perfectly clean ending right there
01:01:42 But you know, they wanted to do more and that's fine. They had they had things to explain legitimately
01:01:46 So they planned that the real story of kingdom hearts is that uh
01:01:51 Sephiroth
01:01:52 Is standing on a cliff somewhere being gay for cloud and waiting for him to show up so they can have a
01:01:57 Gay fight and that's true a sword fight with their dicks. That's every game
01:02:02 Since okay since the game is not yet and I haven't played it
01:02:05 This isn't really a spoiler, but just I heard I heard that there just is no sephiroth boss fight in kingdom hearts 3
01:02:14 That's what I heard and like that makes me I don't know if that's true
01:02:17 That would be so weird because like don't they want to push the remake?
01:02:21 Okay, well here's the thing and this is where things get a little bit scary. Um,
01:02:26 I think that they're planning that as dlc
01:02:29 Um, that's my fear. This is my fear
01:02:33 and
01:02:34 You know like okay, so I would I would still I still find that weird because I would think they would want to push the
01:02:39 The remake I would think they would include that just for that. Wait, what do you mean the remake? Oh of seven
01:02:44 Of course, of course that that makes a lot of sense makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Yeah. Good fucking point. The you know
01:02:50 Uh, that re that fucking remake is in rough shape right now. Um, they they recently like completely scrapped all work
01:02:56 I think and started over no fucking way
01:02:59 You know what? I might be confused that with another story, but uh at the very least we have not heard any positive
01:03:04 updates and the only the only dlc that kingdom hearts 3 should have is fucking like
01:03:08 Sora goes to disney world and he goes in the princess room and else is like do you have magic hands?
01:03:14 and he fucking
01:03:16 Gets a a cold hand job. I don't know that sounds good. That sounds good. Um
01:03:23 I I don't know I've uh, I've just heard a couple things in the over the grapevine
01:03:27 But like when I you know kingdom hearts 2 was weird
01:03:30 I mean because they they released kingdom hearts 2 right and then that was that was a standalone game
01:03:34 It had all its stuff then they released final mix not not in the west
01:03:37 But eventually it came out in the west years like 10 years later. Um, but they did in japan and like I'm like
01:03:43 Is it worse to buy dlc or to like buy an updated version of the same game?
01:03:49 I like like the idea of buying an updated version because it feels like real commitment
01:03:53 As opposed to like slapping shit out and just rolling it out whenever it's done
01:03:57 Uh, which just feels sloppy, but maybe that's just an emotional response. You know
01:04:03 I don't know. I just can't stop thinking of like weird stupid gay people sex jokes and fucking
01:04:08 everybody's
01:04:11 Is that related to kingdom hearts? I don't know. I'm just on I'm just I'm just on her
01:04:14 I'm on a real gay thing this week. I can't stop
01:04:18 All I want to talk about is like and then sora goes up to donald and he's like, hey, I'm gonna fuck you donald and
01:04:25 Then goop. I'm gonna fuck you when you're in your pillow out there
01:04:28 Then goofy is like well, I'm gonna fuck myself and then mickey is like nobody will fuck me
01:04:37 Not even mini he's getting cut by peat. That's the thing that happens, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was actually the first steamboat willy
01:04:48 Actually the first one was called uh, what's it called the the charlie steamer, uh, but they they they thought that was not good for the cleveland steamer
01:04:55 The cleveland steamer. That's the one. That's the one
01:04:59 The fuck is happening. They revamped it before release. Historians agree. It was the right decision
01:05:06 Walt Disney really was a marketing genius
01:05:10 This episode is weird guys

01:06:33 The steven universe fan base has been inoculated already with uh instructions explicit instructions from sunstone
01:06:41 To not deal with bullies to just say no to bullies like us. So no matter what we do
01:06:46 Uh, they're fine. They're gonna be fine. Hey steven universe fans. We're the bully sunstone was warning you
01:06:53 Not me. I'm just the guy who fucks all the gems. I just fuck them. I'm not a bully. I'm just a sex man
01:07:05 That's just bully with me. Hey, all right, let's go
01:07:09 If every pork chopper perfect, I wouldn't fuck pearl. Oh, they rolled they rolled out that line. They rolled out the
01:07:17 Every pork chop like that because like it means nothing to why diamond was she does not know what a pork chop is
01:07:23 But that was I think that was that was for us not didn't she watch dug?
01:07:28 Didn't she watch seminal nick tune dug? Hey, remember that episode where him and roger bought all the hands on the wall
01:07:34 Remember this christmas special where they're gonna kill pork chop. What no why
01:07:39 He like bite
01:07:40 Someone's being an asshole or doing something dangerous and pork chop like bites him and a totally justified act
01:07:45 But the guy's like he's a wild dog. We got to put him down. They're gonna do it. Yeah
01:07:50 What why didn't they do it? What's that? Hey, remember? Hey, remember that episode where skeeter gets banana putting on their
01:07:56 Oh
01:08:00 Okay, all right, that's enough. Let's let's just float on to our fucking voice next episode of the procrastinators podcast the dug
01:08:10 I mean at this point it's the new
01:08:12 Utilitarianism we just need to get it out of our system. I guess just uh
01:08:15 All right. Okay. This is our first fucking voicemail. Here we go. Okay. It's from
01:08:19 Everyone's going crazy for this pizza
01:08:22 I was getting the foot off the pee. All right. Okay. Go. You're currently reading camo. You're on deck play
01:08:30 I know it's a meme, but I really hate the phrase friendship simulator
01:08:34 A one-way audio tracks doesn't really equate
01:08:38 To a friendship and what a friendship can mean
01:08:41 On the other hand, I really like the phrase simulator and it's kind of fun to think about what you can apply it to
01:08:47 For instance, you could consider a movie an experience simulator
01:08:51 Or you could call a book a thought simulator
01:08:54 And that one really rings true for me because when you're reading
01:08:58 it's almost like the author is
01:09:00 Instructing your mind to think in a certain way and to follow along with the specific thought process
01:09:06 I don't know just a thought
01:09:09 Okay, first of all fair enough. Uh, that's generally true. Second of all the friendship simulator is designed to be
01:09:16 Generally insulting. I think uh, I think we're all in agreement here that we are not your friends
01:09:21 I hope so. I hope we're in agreement about that. Of course
01:09:25 Nor are we each other's friends
01:09:28 Well, absolutely. Absolutely. It's yeah, I feel genuine. I feel genuine. You know, I'm
01:09:34 Viewers, uh, I'm a well-wisher and that I wish you know specific harm. Yeah. Yeah, shoehorned in a simpsons reference. Good
01:09:40 Wait, is that it?
01:09:42 I thought you were like building to something with that. No, I just wanted to quote moe. I guess that's how moe
01:09:49 Is like
01:09:51 In the in the one where in the one where the where he eats the chili pepper and the spirit coyote tells homer
01:09:56 He's got to find his soulmate. He thinks he's he's misled for a moment that marge might not be his soulmate
01:10:02 So he goes to the bar and he starts asking everyone there if they're his soulmates
01:10:05 And barney's like no, I'm more of a chum and Carl's like I'm an acquaintance and what he's like
01:10:10 I'm a something and moe says I'm a well-wisher and that I wish you know
01:10:13 Specific harm and then our dad would say that to me all the time. He really liked that quote. He really liked that quote
01:10:20 That was his uh, that was my I was our dad's um, the sun is shining the kid or the birds are chirping
01:10:26 But kids like you should be burning in hell
01:10:32 He wished us no specific harm and you know
01:10:35 All right next one from cheesy. Um, what what?
01:10:39 Um, I was gonna say the the bit at the end about experience simulator. There's a there's a video
01:10:44 There's a video by innuendo studios where he talks about um
01:10:48 Uh, this is not it's like this is not a tomato is what it's called
01:10:52 It's like he does like a big like metaphor explaining like what art is and he there's a part he talks for a while about like
01:10:59 Stories actually I think it might be the his video on the beginner's guide whatever doesn't matter
01:11:04 The point is he's quoting some he's quoting like an unauthor
01:11:07 Like a writer. I forget who he's talking about stories and he says that like a story is like you use words and language to
01:11:15 To to stimulate like a series of micro memories of your experiences, right?
01:11:20 So like you have memories of like what a tree is like so in a story
01:11:23 He might like describe a tree and then you pull up your version of a tree and that's like a little
01:11:27 Many experience you're having from the description in the text and it strings these micro memories together into a sequence that creates
01:11:33 Like an extended false memory and that false memory is what the story is and I thought that was neat
01:11:39 I thought that's a neat way to think about it. Yeah, okay
01:11:42 By the way, I'm just looking I'm sure this will be in the show notes, but this master slimelint is a very
01:11:49 Absolute unit. He's just colossal. Yeah, he's to scale 72 feet across
01:11:55 Why then what what what in treats you to such a massive individual? Why do you get such a big lad?
01:12:02 What's makes you special?
01:12:04 I look I spent I spent years I spent years in my slimewood lab slash dungeon in the basement of saint ben's cathedral
01:12:11 Just like just just concocting them concocting them out of goo and ooze and whatever raw materials
01:12:16 I had at hand
01:12:17 I guess that's fair and and the result was a massive success
01:12:20 But there was a lot of there was a lot of byproduct
01:12:22 There was a lot of runoff and it all collect it all collected into the being known as master slimelint
01:12:27 Oh, I see by the way whose name he's really based on the bubble from uh mermaid man barnacle boy, right?
01:12:33 Uh, well someone someone suggested I give him that face. He doesn't actually have a face
01:12:38 It's pretty fun. It's pretty funny though. So after the image his name is a reference to the master. Um
01:12:44 The the elemental masters from ululilias book
01:12:47 Yeah, legend of the 10 elemental masters because they all have names
01:12:51 Although the elemental masters are like the fire one is the master lavalent
01:12:55 And the the water one is the master lavalent. Um and stuff
01:12:58 So he's the master slimelint because because all those are just big orbs of whatever element they are and so too
01:13:05 With my boy here
01:13:07 Sick, okay moving on. Here we go voicemail from cheesy man fraydo. He's back again. What do you got?
01:13:14 Hey ben saint, um, I just came back to
01:13:19 apologize about
01:13:21 My last voicemail
01:13:23 It's kind of really shitty of me just to use it to secretly show my web comic and
01:13:29 I don't know. I just been thinking about it a lot. So I decided to come back in to apologize, you know
01:13:41 All right, just kidding bitch. I got a patron on that fucking voicemail. Take that honky bongo luna forever
01:13:49 Oh, no
01:13:53 What a heel turn the joke of that man has gone too far
01:13:58 I got I got a he he challenged me the bongo and luna guy challenged me
01:14:03 He sent me a challenge on twitter. He he added me with something
01:14:08 And I wanted to respond, but I didn't know how I guess I was just really intimidated. I guess I was really
01:14:13 I guess I was just scared into silence. I was just scared into silence. Um
01:14:19 Well, that's been for you cowered through and through there we go. There we go. Okay
01:14:23 Next mail I guess
01:14:25 Uh j clark 98, uh leon on us
01:14:31 Good evening pcp
01:14:33 I am jogging plug from sub world
01:14:37 Japan
01:14:38 Long time listener
01:14:40 First time caller the other week night said taxation is theft
01:14:46 And I just have a few words
01:14:48 Did you know the top one tenth of one percent?
01:14:53 Owns as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. It is an outrage and it's time. They started paying their fair share
01:15:02 I'll leave you with some readings
01:15:05 One the communist menu festo by carl mox
01:15:09 True mind calm by adult
01:15:14 No, no stop you're ruining rainbows from a snowflake a collection of 34 essays by tumba users
01:15:22 Thank you for your time. Well adding those to my recommended reading list, of course
01:15:27 I'll let you know how I think you have a lot. I think you I think you can learn a few things name
01:15:30 I think I have many lessons to learn. I think you could I think you could expand your horizons
01:15:34 In all I think I think you need to I think you need to be more sympathetic with the plight of the working man
01:15:38 Indeed indeed and of the uh, I guess
01:15:42 Uh, the poor oppressed german by those damn jews. Yeah
01:15:46 Yeah, exactly. Okay. I'll open my heart to that
01:15:50 Yeah, if you were talking about it before you were talking up, you know, how uh, yeah hitler oppressed
01:15:56 Um, oh right, right. He was a deeply. This is what happened. Yeah. This is what happens
01:16:00 This is what you know, you got one too many jeff bezos and you get another hitler. That's all insane
01:16:05 All right next one the enlightened communist. Oh, okay. We're keeping right along. Let's see what he's got
01:16:11 Hey, guys, sorry. I haven't sent in a voicemail in a while
01:16:15 I was really busy jerking my gherkin and I've been wondering that's my favorite opening
01:16:19 You still get messages about pony stuff and how hard was it to transition away from
01:16:24 MLP related content and has your pony past had any effect on your current career?
01:16:34 Any thoughts, uh, well, I don't remember any pony voicemails
01:16:39 Not voicemails. I think he's talking about like, uh, pony messages
01:16:44 Yeah, anybody at young twitter say fuck off clopper, you know, shit like that
01:16:48 Everyone every once in a while someone will someone will obliquely reference uh, phantom horn
01:16:52 Yeah, and you know sometimes people ask me where's the where's the t-bat max revive, which is uh fair enough
01:16:58 I definitely view it as one of many black marks on my life and reputation that will never leave me and will forever follow me to my grave
01:17:09 Yep fair fair. I suppose that's fair to say I get very little of it once in a while get like a keg standard
01:17:15 But pretty much like Ben. I mean, I almost I almost got I almost had to get beat up by misanthropony that one time
01:17:21 But uh, but uh, I mean I managed to uh, I managed to talk my way out of it
01:17:27 I um, it's it's weird. I haven't really got any of that from anyone
01:17:31 Like my old like pony videos occasionally still get comments about like ha ha. They said the word know a lot
01:17:38 No, there's really old ones. Yeah, those great ones, but I don't get like current fans saying ha ha give and take
01:17:44 You're you were a pony your pony ha ha like I don't get any of that
01:17:48 Well, it'd be mostly I feel people, you know, whatever people who uh dislike or hate pony stuff for whatever reason
01:17:54 Like trying to like be like hey remember this embarrassing thing you did
01:17:58 I
01:17:59 The only people I get the only people I get doing that is you guys
01:18:03 Making fun of me for being rightfully making fun of me for being on analysis anarchy indeed. That's true
01:18:10 I I I've come to accept that that is just really funny and I don't
01:18:13 It is. Yeah, I don't even mind it that whole comparison of like Danny DeVito being you ben versus me being our old swarzenegger
01:18:19 And that like brothers. Okay, class. The thing is that's true
01:18:23 But in an intellectual capacity
01:18:25 Exclusively when it comes to specifically the choice to be a part of or not be a part of analysis anarchy
01:18:31 That was it that that was that was the mo that was the defining moment of my arc
01:18:35 And you know, I I picked I picked a side. I picked a side and I could never go back. That's it. That's it
01:18:41 But I I mean I guess for me, uh, like I really did just make a hard
01:18:45 I mean, I remember agonizing about like oh
01:18:48 Should I like use t-bap to like put I put videos on to like be like I've got a new channel guys come watch me
01:18:53 I was just like fuck it. Nah, whatever you you you I think you made like a point like
01:18:59 Ben like don't like don't link to my stuff. Don't like my other stuff from from t-bap
01:19:05 I was very concerned about my ability to like not just be a pony guy forever. I was concerned about that
01:19:12 Um, yeah, but it worked out pretty well
01:19:14 I suppose it's fair to say what had just gone better
01:19:17 What had just been a faster growth like what did you did if I like had used that?
01:19:21 But yeah, no, I'm maybe I'm not worried about it now. Obviously. I doubt it would have made like a big difference in the long run. Yeah, yeah
01:19:29 I think actually if you had that pony like back backing you may not have started we agua
01:19:35 Like you why you say that like
01:19:37 Because it's it's sort of like you have like but the pony stuff you have like an
01:19:41 An easy street like a bunch of subscribers that are already there like the algorithms already working in your favor
01:19:47 Starting from scratch is a lot harder. So like making
01:19:50 You know a month of regular content me and you know may not have been like a thing on your mind as much
01:19:56 That is true. But you know when it comes to like there was really no chance
01:19:59 We were gonna like I would even like because it was a shared channel with me and ben
01:20:03 I was just like uncomfortable with the idea
01:20:05 I mean, I didn't want to deal with the complexity of like making this my channel now
01:20:09 Like I was just like I can abandon this like this is a
01:20:12 Whatever ben could post on it. Would you like to preserve that channel for posterity just with the stuff on it?
01:20:18 I mean, maybe one day we'll update it. We'll see there's big things coming. There's big things coming on that channel
01:20:23 That's you're not wrong. You're not wrong. There's a big thing coming on that. I wouldn't have a big monetized
01:20:28 We'll have to check
01:20:29 I want to know dude. We got a post we got a post max revive tbap to the patreon and get that sweet like
01:20:34 Definitely doing that that like eight dollars of people that are still the tbap patreon. Yeah
01:20:39 Yeah, the tbap the abandoned tbap patreon
01:20:42 It's it's alive. It's alive and well. It's going going strong
01:20:47 Um, okay. Well, anyway, I haven't made it. Haven't made a dime off it in what years now. Yeah, absolutely probably three years or something
01:20:54 Hell, yeah, uh, okay next one. Here we go
01:20:57 Well, what about you mage? Have any thoughts on this? I mean, you don't do pony stuff anymore
01:21:01 But like in in your circles
01:21:04 Every now and then like I get comments on videos or messages or whatever like, hey, are you still on the pony fandom?
01:21:10 I'm like, no
01:21:12 Think you're the only one think you're the only one of us still dealing with that
01:21:15 I think it's because of the whole alethel halloween cola because people
01:21:20 Find it over and over again. And that's a big one. I get comments like oh, I watched this one. I was little
01:21:25 Oh, I remember I was so scared
01:21:27 I get comments. Oh my god. Oh, that's kind of nice
01:21:31 Dang, I want. Yeah, I watched this when I was just a kid. Yeah, I'm 14 now
01:21:36 God damn you guys talked over each other
01:21:39 I said, yeah, I said, yeah, I watched this when I was just a kid. Yeah, I'm I'm 14 now
01:21:43 Yeah, pretty much pretty much. Yeah, I was I was just saying like how long is it going to be until like I'm a nostalgic property
01:21:50 Like the hypocrite videos be like, oh man, I remember watching those
01:21:54 I'm already nostalgic for those like compilation videos at the very least
01:21:58 Even the next episode
01:21:59 The animations you did I really liked those
01:22:02 The water glass glass of water. Yeah, it's probably been what like two years since you made those or something
01:22:08 Yeah, well like I'm I'm thinking like like
01:22:11 Like a munchy level like oh, you were a baby when you watched me and now you're a human being and you're talking about it
01:22:18 Like I like the things I made are like
01:22:21 As important to you as like anything else. Yeah, well, you know, it's what's youtube. That's true
01:22:26 But you know, it's gonna be interesting. We're a generation that basically all of us
01:22:29 Even munchy probably for the most part. Although no because homestuck was this big thing
01:22:34 Oh, well, I was just gonna say that like we all grew up and basically our media stuff like was
01:22:38 You know produced by like big companies and like it was like shows and stuff
01:22:42 And well, those are obviously still big and what game of thrones and whatnot
01:22:45 Obviously things are skewing more towards like the youtube and a little granular like, you know
01:22:50 Middle-class creators who were you know individually successful. Yeah, I suppose as we just get further and further
01:22:55 It's gonna be like a generation that like they are biggest nostalgic thing. There's I don't know the Logan Paul vlogs or something
01:23:02 Oh, yeah, something like that. I mean, there's so I mean so many kids so many kids watching that stuff
01:23:07 You know, there's gonna be a whole generation of like boy. Yeah. Remember Logan Paul from when we were kids. Remember
01:23:12 Remember Spider-Man and Elsa remember a bad man and wait
01:23:17 Spiper man and bad man. You know what I'm talking about those guys
01:23:21 Batman
01:23:22 That's the life. Oh, I love chomkin
01:23:25 Must be my favorite. I mean, I'm already like, uh, you know, remember
01:23:30 Metal Gear awesome. Yeah
01:23:33 It's so cool. Isn't it so cool how the internet the internet has allowed like
01:23:37 Yeah, like individual creators to make stuff that made a huge impact like Homestuck. It's so great. Yeah, like
01:23:43 So many kids like the fact that munchie like grew up in like Homestuck was his thing
01:23:47 Is like, wow, it's pretty great. It's pretty amazing 10 out of 10
01:23:51 Oh, what did I have what I have fucking um, and a man adult swim. I don't know
01:23:56 We need to lose what you had. I had Winnie the Pooh. Yeah, I had Disney shit. I had Arthur
01:24:02 I don't get I don't get Disney heads
01:24:05 They're babies. I don't know. Arthur was uh hippo. I said I said in
01:24:09 Oh, wait, no, this wasn't this was cut. This was cut from my script of the first poo video
01:24:13 But in the first poo video originally I went on a digression like comparing poo to Arthur
01:24:18 and how like for me
01:24:20 Arthur was like like baby books in my like
01:24:24 Elementary school library and I was like, oh, these are like baby books. I don't know the real shit though
01:24:29 And and then but then like Arthur was a tv show and it seems like people think Arthur was pretty good
01:24:34 Like people remember it pretty fondly, but it was already tainted like I was like, oh, that's a baby
01:24:39 Franchise for babies. No, no, thanks. I mean, although I might have been a little old for Arthur when it came on tv
01:24:45 I forget exactly. I look back on when Arthur punched EW with much fondness and
01:24:51 blowing
01:24:52 Remembrance
01:24:53 Oh, yeah. All right. Next voicemail. Let's do it. This is from um
01:24:57 Nyan Kwan. Nyan. That's not a real name. Get the fuck. So I'm a member of the inferior species known as the female
01:25:05 I've never had the joy of having a big fat
01:25:08 shlong dangle in between my legs
01:25:11 I just want to know what's it like having a dick
01:25:13 Like
01:25:14 Why do some dicks curve to the left or to the right? Which way does your dick curve pcb boys?
01:25:20 I want to know I want to know everything about dicks. All I know is how to put them in my fucking mouth
01:25:26 I suck that dick all the time
01:25:28 Yeah, but yeah, just I wanted all the dick facts. What's it like having a dick? Okay, bye
01:25:34 Guys before anyone answers this is a trap that girl's 11 years old. Do not answer her questions
01:25:40 Do not engage do not engage
01:25:45 Yeah, it's pretty good. It's fine. It could be
01:25:49 Uh, it's sick. It's fucking I imagine it's like easier than not having one because you have like control
01:25:56 But it is, you know mass that is, you know, in existence control like the patriarchy
01:26:01 My dick my dick has a my I'm going for I'm going for guys. You can't fucking stop me call call the cops
01:26:06 My dick has a my dick has a very slight leftward. It's a very slight leftward curve. I think you're a left leaner
01:26:12 I am I am a bit of a left leaner. Yeah, me too
01:26:16 See it's funny Nate because I was thinking oh, it's because you because you jack off all the time
01:26:20 And it's like, oh you're bending it because you're like applying all that force like
01:26:23 But hey, but you're a lefty. Yeah, you're a lefty and I'm a righty, but our dicks curve the same way
01:26:27 I guess it's not the jacking off that take that atheists
01:26:31 All right, I I remember like like finding out like
01:26:36 That it was starting to bend in one way. It's like, huh, is that bad?
01:26:40 And I think it was just literally the way that I put my pants on
01:26:43 Oh, that could do it. I mean and that's like the way it was just resting it
01:26:46 There was I had to go one way or the other. I wouldn't like force it down like the middle path
01:26:51 Just cut it in two. That's what you got to do
01:26:53 So it just it just like naturally would be squished in one direction or the other and then that's how it grows
01:26:59 Yeah, yeah, and it really doesn't matter because it it's it's a floppy thing
01:27:04 Here that's true. That's true. You can bend it right back
01:27:08 Throw it over your shoulder. Uh, you know all the good things like a continental soldier
01:27:18 That's true. I've been an industrious young lady could figure it out too though
01:27:22 If she yeah, I suppose you could employ a funnel perhaps or something along those funnel like like a garden hose
01:27:29 Girls can pee standing up a thing. Well, yeah, but drawing while peeing, you know, that's uh, oh, yeah
01:27:34 It's gonna take some skill some some maneuverability
01:27:37 You'd have if you saved up a lot like you had a lot of pee you'd have to write really big like you'd have to like
01:27:42 Take steps right and like walk. Yeah, that's the way to do it
01:27:46 Well, you could just do it. You have to use a big font
01:27:49 You have to write some like show card gothic or something. Yeah, I was gonna say try peeing and show card gothic next time
01:27:55 All right, and do it in bold too. Okay. All right. Oh next another voicemail from no, thank you commence
01:28:04 Hey guys, so I haven't made a voice message in a little while. I was wondering if anyone in the procrastinators
01:28:12 Has has been interested in the subject of new tropics if you don't know what new tropics are
01:28:16 It's a fancy name for mind enhancing drugs
01:28:20 Not like creation or but things that will make you
01:28:24 More able to concentrate or focus or reduce anxiety, you know, the the good and
01:28:29 Pragmatic and utilitarian kind of drugs
01:28:32 Yes, yes, if not why you can tend to just
01:28:36 Especially the transhumanists on the podcast and starfleet
01:28:40 future starfleet officers
01:28:42 On the podcast why you consent to just let your brain
01:28:46 Be how it was biologically made and not make any attempt to improve it
01:28:50 With with any means necessary including buying
01:28:54 Illicit substances off of strange chinese manufacturers on the internet
01:28:59 Why what's wrong with you? Especially since most of these things are perfectly legal. I swear officer. They're perfectly legal
01:29:05 So yeah, that's my question anyone have any experience with new tropics or other
01:29:09 Smart drugs brain enhancing drugs and no, you know, it does not count. Did you boy? Oh my god?
01:29:14 We did not count as a new topic. We'd makes you dumb
01:29:18 I just kidding. I smoke weed every day
01:29:22 I I feel like
01:29:24 We we we have collectively had trouble with new topics on the podcast
01:29:28 Yeah, we just can't come up with them. We abandon them the idea entirely
01:29:33 You're right
01:29:35 Well, um
01:29:36 What counts? I mean does cath to something like caffeine count as a new topic? I take stuff like I take stimulants like that
01:29:42 Yeah, maybe technically
01:29:43 Caffeine's a hot topic. I I do find I do find that like I focus I mean he said like when I'm a little like
01:29:49 I'm a little buzzed on on on something like caffeine. It's like I don't know
01:29:53 I get I can like get like really invested in something and like, you know
01:29:59 A little bit of tea
01:30:00 Goes along we well the way that he clarified it as like not being mind-altering drugs or whatever. I'm just
01:30:08 Confused it like I guess the criteria of it like what constitutes it because like
01:30:14 Yeah, for example like lsd or whatever mdma like all those like psychedelic drugs
01:30:19 Like yeah, I don't think that those would fit into his criteria
01:30:21 But like I know people who've done them
01:30:24 And everyone who does who who has ever done them has always like said the same thing like
01:30:28 Changed their whole outlook on life from doing it once or whatever. Yeah, so I think that should count as like a mind-strengthening thing. I guess
01:30:37 I could have you what he I could have used like a list of like some examples of what
01:30:42 I could answer the question a lot better. I mean did he say yeah, he said Adderall was I've been on I've done Adderall a few times
01:30:48 And I will definitely say that when I'm on it
01:30:52 I don't know why anyone would ever not be on it because it literally makes you a better
01:30:58 smarter person
01:31:00 Uh like in every way. It's like it's like
01:31:03 It's like a kaioken technique in like a pill form
01:31:07 Like multiplies your strength times 10
01:31:10 And
01:31:11 Our uh, our I mean our dad our dad got me uh got me a little in very briefly at one point
01:31:19 And uh, I ended up kicking a hole in a wall
01:31:22 While under the influence of it. I don't think that made me a better or more effective person
01:31:27 Well, I took it for like two. I took it for like two weeks. I've always
01:31:31 Jesse if if if Adderall is makes you a better person
01:31:35 Why don't you take it all the time because I don't know how to get it
01:31:37 It's like it's like you you can't just get anything that you need everything is impossible to get your hands on
01:31:44 Because you like have to go to a doctor and like I don't know like where do you get that shit
01:31:48 All I know is that someone gave it to me once or a few times and like I don't I don't know where you fucking get that
01:31:53 Like I'm not well, okay someone surely someone someone on your local street. I'm not jumping through hoops to get anything
01:32:01 I would rather be stupid and miserable and depressed than jump through any hoops to get or do anything
01:32:07 Anything that I have to work for or put in any kind of effort at all
01:32:11 That could be time better spent like wrapped up in a blanket hiding in the dark
01:32:16 Fuck you know
01:32:18 I you know if you're on Adderall wouldn't be saying that's also true. Yeah
01:32:22 At Adderall Adderall Jesse you'd be like man. I better you know, I gotta I gotta start I gotta start branching out
01:32:28 Yeah, it's time to do my fucking taxes. It's time to fucking get a real job. It's time to go back to college
01:32:34 And I would do all of that in like in one hour. I would
01:32:38 You know
01:32:40 Okay on on the general subject here, I'm happy to answer why so I have the versions
01:32:45 They kind of creep me out doing drugs in general and even things like surgery because they're like they're like fucking with your body
01:32:53 And like okay, this guy's right that like utilitarianly whatever pragmatically
01:32:57 There's nothing that says the default state of a human is like the best or correct or like will definitely go flawlessly
01:33:05 But it's just when I when I think about messing with that
01:33:08 I get nervous and like to take a step like that makes me think like, okay
01:33:12 I really want to make sure what I'm doing is like, I know I'm not gonna fuck myself up or like, you know
01:33:17 I don't know like if I take they say that like lsd
01:33:20 I think they say gets embedded in your spinal cord when you take it and then like years later when you're like moving or
01:33:25 Benning or something it can release that like
01:33:27 Encaptured bit of lsd and you go on a trip whatever you're doing at that time
01:33:32 And I know that's just one small thing
01:33:33 but those are the sorts of things that I think about and
01:33:37 And on the other hand, I am a pretty damn effective human being so like I don't really feel the need to
01:33:44 Boost myself in those ways
01:33:47 But it's it's always possible that things would just be better if I like took Adderall or any of that stuff
01:33:52 But you have to weigh the risks the risks are why and I don't know the risks. So you know, that's it
01:33:58 I was yeah thinking about that. It's like
01:34:01 Surgery specifically if you have like um, say there's a new surgery to like to add your brain power plus one
01:34:09 um
01:34:10 You would get surgery when your leg's broken because you have a broken leg and that's painful and it's terrible
01:34:15 Yeah, if you have a pretty fine leg, would you get surgery to improve your leg if it was fine?
01:34:20 Probably not. So it's sort of like if you're in a really bad spot
01:34:25 Um, and you're like, uh, I'm gonna die
01:34:27 You know through suicide because I'm so depressed and I can't do anything
01:34:31 Uh, and then there's this surgery to like give you a brain happiness thing
01:34:36 Like it would be a better idea
01:34:39 When you're in like the lowest point and like you're you're already broken. You may as well fix yourself
01:34:44 Adding to yourself like improving something that's fine
01:34:47 Yeah, it does have a risk to it
01:34:50 Just generally I just yeah, I feel okay. So like I don't feel the need to
01:34:55 Take drugs in general and that doesn't preclude our all our lives from just being better if we did
01:35:01 Like I don't know explore some of this stuff like sam harris and first of all, I do coffee
01:35:06 I mean, I you know, I drink coffee. So that's caffeine. That's a boost
01:35:08 Like sam harris talks all the time about how he is like he's a smart guy. I respect his intelligence
01:35:13 There's been a couple times in life where he has like done something like uh, like like mdmt or whatever it's called
01:35:19 And he did it in like a safe environment and like what he says he got out of it
01:35:23 Or like is like a transcendental experience, which for him was an awakening to like some of his
01:35:29 He argues a lot of things that I agree with that like consciousness is an illusion. There is no self
01:35:34 It's an illusion and like when he took mdmt
01:35:36 I think he was saying that like he was very aware that like we are all everything in the universe is connected in the sense
01:35:43 That it's all like matter
01:35:45 Being operated on by the same forces in like a unified system
01:35:49 Not that there's any like higher power guiding it just you know, the laws of physics or whatever
01:35:52 And this also like killed his ego in the sense that he felt just like
01:35:57 Part of the stardust of the universe like had no self
01:36:00 Uh had no personal identity
01:36:02 That was all stuff that comes from like our you know, like our programming and our brains and whatnot
01:36:07 And I I agree with that and maybe taking mdmt or something would help me to also experience these higher level
01:36:14 Ways of thinking or maybe great make great art great music or whatever
01:36:18 But I just don't feel like I need to and I worry that it would fuck something up
01:36:22 So I guess that's it. That's why that's why I think about it though sometimes
01:36:26 Well, my goal is to do every drug and every activity possible until I'm god
01:36:35 So like I believe that like
01:36:38 I don't know like the more experiences I
01:36:40 Absorb into me the more powerful I become
01:36:44 No matter what so like I just I want all knowledge inside my brain so that I can shoot lightning from my fucking eyeballs
01:36:53 And stop wiping my ass once and for all with the knowledge that I've obtained
01:37:02 You just you take a drug that turns your poop into little rocks and then they come out all dry
01:37:08 That sounds good
01:37:10 You don't have to wipe anything
01:37:13 And that's how the first uh gem people were created at the beginning of steven universe
01:37:18 That's what that's what some guy in some galaxy somewhere
01:37:22 Just did all the drugs until he became a fucking gem
01:37:26 And then like turned in it like made a body and became white diamond
01:37:30 It was originally just a guy on drugs
01:37:33 A lot of fucking drugs
01:37:35 Uh
01:37:37 He turned into a crack rock dude. Who's the who's the crystal meth gem? That's when you see he's out there somewhere
01:37:45 Um, all right. Let's do another call here
01:37:48 This is from oh, wait. I'm in the wrong chat. Uh, all right. Here we go. This is from um
01:37:53 Kishin slayer. Oh, yeah, our old sword guy buddy. Let's see what he's got
01:37:57 go
01:37:58 I'm finally able to totally work on the swords, but I need a deadline
01:38:02 Mage asked for something out of my current abilities
01:38:05 Nate you said you need some time to think about what you wanted me to make
01:38:08 Digi gave me enough to go on but never totally specified what he had in mind
01:38:12 Davoo is silent as an overlord should be but I would still like confirmation if he doesn't want anything
01:38:18 I like jesse too much. So I'll still give him a pirate sword even if he doesn't contact me
01:38:22 The deadline will be when the next episode goes live at that time all requests are locked in
01:38:27 With digis unless otherwise told I'll just do whatever the hell I want
01:38:31 Also go play meow by bubble one games. It is literally the comfiest game that has ever been made
01:38:38 That's good image take note
01:38:40 No, no, it's gonna be completely clear. I didn't ask for anything. I back when we he first asked about us
01:38:46 I thought we were memeing and I just I just said I just said, uh, oh no
01:38:50 No, this is the most serious man's ever let
01:38:53 He's gonna make a real fake sword. Yeah, but I don't I don't know. I feel bad for
01:38:58 Requesting something like that. I mean, I mean this guy comes into our thing and is like hey guys
01:39:03 Give me information to make you a sword, which is a little presumptuous
01:39:07 But you know
01:39:09 We don't owe him anything and I don't really care that much
01:39:12 But you know make me a fucking vampire hundred d sword like d has in vampire hundred d. There you go
01:39:18 You got my order. That's it
01:39:20 I don't I don't even know what to ask
01:39:23 Here's what I like I like the fucking yeah, I like I don't know what this guy's level of skill is or if it's possible
01:39:30 You know what sword I fucking like I like the glass swords from morrowind the fucking
01:39:35 They're like green and shiny and they're got like fucking they look cool. Make me a fucking morrowind glass sword
01:39:42 What about rose quartz a sword?
01:39:45 That's a big pink one big pink one. That's the site the site
01:39:50 Make that for
01:39:52 also me, I don't know I
01:39:54 I guarantee that my sword is the coolest and will look the best
01:39:57 Did you give him detailed specs and whatnot? I gave him a little I gave him details and I made it like a like a
01:40:04 Like not ridiculously difficult so that he would you know be able to focus on making it as as good as possible
01:40:10 Yeah, all right. It's I am I've been he he messages me on discord once in a while and uh
01:40:16 Tells me like
01:40:18 Man ben making this flambé as you asked for is gonna be really hard and I'm always like hey
01:40:24 You remember all the remember how every time you say that I'm like
01:40:27 I told you like a fun s stock is fine, too
01:40:29 And he's like no no no i'm gonna do it it's gonna be a challenge and then a couple other days later
01:40:34 He's like man this flam this curved blade is gonna be really hard and I'm like hey remember man
01:40:38 I told you you don't have to do that. It's fine. He's like no no no it's gonna be good
01:40:42 It's gonna be tell I'm buying all this extra equipment just to make it possible
01:40:46 I'm like okay. You know whatever you want to do just remember. I said an s stock was fine
01:40:50 I'm telling you right now. I don't want you to have this weird emotional leverage over me like you're doing me a big
01:40:54 Fucking favor so just forget it. I don't want anything. That's that's what I have to say
01:40:58 Well, you guys are stupid. He's making a sword. It's gonna be cool. I don't want to have to look at this guy anything
01:41:03 I don't maybe I don't suck. I don't fucking know
01:41:06 I don't know maybe I'll maybe I'll get it and I'll sorry
01:41:10 I feel like I'm coming off because it was a little mean I'll still fucking keep it
01:41:12 I'll still but then I'll have a sword and you won't that'll means I can kill you
01:41:16 Let me just quickly say like I appreciate it
01:41:18 But like you would have nowhere to send it to so don't make a sword for me though
01:41:24 I really appreciate the sentiment problem. Are you homeless?
01:41:26 No, I don't want to give out my home address and I don't have a p.o. Box. So
01:41:32 You could probably have him send it to you at like a nearest post-op or maybe maybe you would need a p.o. Box for that
01:41:37 Yeah, that's what p.o. Boxer for oh, you know what he could send it to me and then uh, I could just give it to you
01:41:43 In person. Yeah, that's true
01:41:45 You know what guys this is really boring. Let's talk about these details later because who cares
01:41:48 I agree. Okay. Let's let's next move on to our final voicemail of the day. By the way kitchens later
01:41:54 No disrespect. It's just this is another chore and I have enough chores as it is
01:41:58 So there you go arrested if we carry swords around though. Oh my god. You are in britain. You are in britain
01:42:04 These are not like sword swords. These are like
01:42:08 Yeah
01:42:12 If I were on adderall right now, I could really draw this guy up some schematics of precisely what we all want
01:42:18 If I was on adderall, I could forge this motherfucker myself. I could forge the buster sword single-handedly
01:42:29 All right, let's go on
01:42:31 We've got our final mail of the day and this is from Nate's body anxiety
01:42:35 Um, I'm not looking forward to hearing from him. Well, let's let's go
01:42:41 Run just go now. Listen. You don't have much time. You're not hot yet and you're not getting any younger
01:42:46 Gotta get on that cardio train or the calories that kind of catch up to you
01:42:49 You'll balloon up and then at that point, so
01:42:52 You might as well just be dead
01:42:56 So on that note Nate, how's the running going? I've been trying my hand at cardio, too
01:43:01 But I just kind of feel like
01:43:05 How are you dealing with that
01:43:07 I okay, first of all, it's going like ass. I'll have you know
01:43:11 No, I'm running after this episode as soon as this episode is done. I'm going for a run
01:43:14 Okay, red. It was back on people today. I'm starting again
01:43:18 I completely forgot that was a I know because I've been deliberately avoiding talking about it because I'm embarrassed because I fucking it up
01:43:25 Uh, but
01:43:26 To to your interesting point though how he has trouble doing things after he works out
01:43:30 If if I go to the gym and it's like late when I get home
01:43:34 And I only have like a couple hours to do anything for I have to go to sleep for work
01:43:37 Then I have trouble like getting work done. Uh, and also the tiredness is also relevant
01:43:41 But like if I just go for a run, I generally feel better and feel like wow
01:43:45 I've accomplished something time to just jump into my next task and I usually get more done when I exercise
01:43:50 So for me, there's no excuse to not exercise all the time. It's just better in every way. It's just laziness
