00:00:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.
00:00:05 I'm supposed to be working right now.
00:00:11 I'm supposed to be working right now.
00:00:16 But I'm not working.
00:00:19 I'm doing nothing.
00:00:22 Why did I'm jerking?
00:00:24 Myself, I'm sucking.
00:00:27 I am an asshole.
00:00:30 I am a stupid.
00:00:32 I got a deadline.
00:00:35 Don't want to do it.
00:00:45 Welcome back.
00:00:48 Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:51 It's me, Munchy.
00:00:53 I'm out in the woods.
00:00:54 I've been straight out for a couple of days now.
00:00:57 The woodland creatures are my friends now.
00:01:00 I was on the plane and now I'm here.
00:01:02 Pro Crastinators Podcast is a podcast about all of my good friends here.
00:01:05 Where they come from all over life.
00:01:07 High, low, slow, or bold.
00:01:09 They're all here.
00:01:10 They draw things.
00:01:11 No, they don't.
00:01:12 They draw things with their voice.
00:01:13 That's what they do.
00:01:14 They video edit.
00:01:15 They're good people.
00:01:16 Here we go.
00:01:17 Ben Saint.
00:01:18 He's last now.
00:01:19 It's Nate Man.
00:01:20 Hey, guys.
00:01:21 I'm the best guy ever.
00:01:23 Just O natural here.
00:01:25 Naked.
00:01:26 We have Tomson.
00:01:30 Hello.
00:01:31 I just made a new animation.
00:01:34 It's a week old by the time you listen to this, but it's still good.
00:01:37 It's still fresh.
00:01:38 Check it out.
00:01:40 It's what that is.
00:01:42 It's the way that you hear she comes.
00:01:45 Hello.
00:01:46 I am Trekin now.
00:01:47 There we go.
00:01:48 We have the digi.
00:01:50 How long since you've smoked?
00:01:54 Less than five minutes.
00:01:56 He didn't.
00:01:57 Okay.
00:01:58 You have to say.
00:02:02 What?
00:02:03 You have to go.
00:02:04 You have to say.
00:02:05 Oh, you have to say it.
00:02:06 I'm keeping it all natural.
00:02:08 I'm not into these laboratory produced chemicals.
00:02:12 I'm keeping it in nature with my sweet cannabis weed.
00:02:16 I'm smoking a fat bag of bowls here.
00:02:19 I was wondering how long it's going to take until someone mentions weed.
00:02:22 Well, zero minutes.
00:02:24 About a minute ago.
00:02:28 I was waiting for everyone to say their piece.
00:02:32 All right.
00:02:33 Okay.
00:02:34 Okay.
00:02:35 So here we go with fucking nature with fucking nature.
00:02:39 Here we go.
00:02:41 Oh Christ.
00:02:43 Oh, my recording just stopped.
00:02:46 It just stopped.
00:02:47 Is that true?
00:02:48 Really?
00:02:49 It just stopped.
00:02:50 Okay.
00:02:51 Hold on.
00:02:52 That's not good.
00:02:53 Nature.
00:02:54 Here we go.
00:02:55 It's nature.
00:02:56 My audio is better now.
00:02:57 Good job for noticing that one audience.
00:02:58 Nature.
00:02:59 Do not flanderize me is my first point about nature.
00:03:02 We're not going to do the dictionary thing because everyone gets mad at us when we do
00:03:06 it now.
00:03:07 It's now like a taboo.
00:03:08 People don't like it for some reason.
00:03:09 No one gets mad.
00:03:10 We have to read this definition because it's the best definition there's ever been.
00:03:13 All right.
00:03:14 Here we go.
00:03:15 Urban dictionary definition.
00:03:16 Nature.
00:03:17 And erection.
00:03:18 Little boy.
00:03:19 Listen.
00:03:20 Listen.
00:03:21 Okay.
00:03:22 Little boy on waking in the morning.
00:03:23 Mama.
00:03:24 What's wrong?
00:03:25 It's sticking up.
00:03:26 Mother to her son.
00:03:27 That's okay, little man.
00:03:28 It's just nature.
00:03:29 Yeah.
00:03:30 Okay.
00:03:31 Okay.
00:03:32 That is good.
00:03:33 Here's how I define nature.
00:03:34 I define it as the enemy.
00:03:36 It's the thing that we are all put on this earth to defeat and subjugate.
00:03:42 Someday there will be none and that's when I want to live.
00:03:45 I have a complicated and sad relationship with nature.
00:03:49 It is evil and I know in my heart of hearts that I have more negatives than I have positive,
00:03:57 but it's just so seductive in most of its ways.
00:04:01 It always tries to lure me to its green, vile grass, but I have to deny it access to
00:04:07 my true heart.
00:04:09 You sound like a robot that's like in the middle of malfunctioning right now.
00:04:15 What do you mean by that?
00:04:17 What do you mean?
00:04:19 So much that I can barely understand what you're saying.
00:04:22 No, that's not true.
00:04:23 You've got to calm down.
00:04:24 You've got to take L.
00:04:25 I have a lot to say about nature.
00:04:28 I've taken my pills a lot.
00:04:30 I'm a part of Big Pharma.
00:04:31 We've been cutting down all the forest so that we can make more pills so that we can calm
00:04:36 your fucking nature problems.
00:04:38 So if you're having a problem where nature is causing you to be hyperactive and fucking...
00:04:43 Am I like literally the only one who loves nature in this podcast?
00:04:47 No, I do.
00:04:48 I do.
00:04:49 I like nature.
00:04:51 I just realize that it's awful in every way.
00:04:54 I like...
00:04:55 Okay, I have a big point to say about nature.
00:04:58 But here, here, let's rate nature.
00:05:00 Like I want to say like six or seven.
00:05:03 I'm going to say hard seven out of ten for nature.
00:05:06 Okay.
00:05:07 I give nature like a solid nine.
00:05:09 I find cool shit outside like all the time.
00:05:12 Yeah, I give a nine out of ten as well.
00:05:14 Needs more purple though.
00:05:15 I'm going to give it a...
00:05:16 That is seven or eight.
00:05:17 That is the slight eight.
00:05:18 Needs more purple is the same reason I wouldn't give it a ten, incidentally.
00:05:22 So I'm with you on that one, Mage.
00:05:25 I'm going to give it a solid two.
00:05:27 I mean, I think it did some good things in its day,
00:05:31 but I think that it's been far surpassed.
00:05:33 You know, it's been iterated upon and rendered mostly obsolete.
00:05:36 I'm also going to give it a two.
00:05:38 The only reason it even gets a two is because it spawned me and my compatriots here.
00:05:44 That's about all the good it's done.
00:05:45 Nature is the final barrier holding humanity down from reaching its true potential.
00:05:50 Once we surpass the limitations, nature is placed upon us like our own mortality.
00:05:55 We will be unburdened by its primitive bullshit,
00:06:00 and we can achieve greater things than we ever could before.
00:06:03 I'm interested to see what Nate will say.
00:06:06 I wonder what his rating is.
00:06:08 You know?
00:06:09 Because it would go to show from what we know about him that would be low.
00:06:12 You might have expected me to say that I'm not a big fan of nature
00:06:16 and that I only care about human progress and evolution
00:06:19 and, you know, advancements in the scientific field,
00:06:22 but there is an aspect of nature that I quite like
00:06:26 and I quite like how it affects the value of two stats,
00:06:30 usually increasing the non-HP stat by 10% and decreasing another by 10%.
00:06:35 You know, like the nature of your average like, you know, a fly-gon, for example,
00:06:41 can make a big difference in whether it's turny viable or not.
00:06:44 So in that respect, I find nature to be a very valuable force.
00:06:48 A lot of people criticize it for being overly complex and obtuse,
00:06:52 not making a lot of sense in terms of the Ghazam Kutzwerk of the gameplay,
00:06:56 but I like it. I like it still, though.
00:06:59 Before we continue on the subject of nature,
00:07:01 I'd like to introduce a new segment really quick.
00:07:04 It's called, it's called Ben vs. Ben.
00:07:09 Oh, boy!
00:07:11 Oh, I like this.
00:07:12 Here's a clip of Ben St. from episode like 10 or so of the PCP
00:07:17 where we're talking about probably sequels or something.
00:07:20 Ah, iterative works can never be as good as the original.
00:07:25 Originality is the most important thing for a work of art to have.
00:07:29 Iterations can never live up to originality.
00:07:32 Fast forward, Ben St. 2018. Nature, gay.
00:07:37 Well, you know, you're on to something there.
00:07:40 You're close to truth.
00:07:42 You would have a point, except that nature is not a work of art
00:07:46 because nature was procedurally generated by an algorithm.
00:07:49 Oh, shit.
00:07:50 So is Nuclear Throne not art?
00:07:52 Is Nuclear Throne not art?
00:07:54 Is that what you're trying to say?
00:07:55 Well, nobody made the algorithm.
00:07:58 Wait, I mean, no.
00:07:59 Well, God made it, you stupid idiot.
00:08:02 Did you not read the instruction manual, a.k.a. the Quran?
00:08:06 Wait, shit.
00:08:08 Okay, all right.
00:08:10 I've backed you on the corner now.
00:08:12 Nuclear Throne is a work of art,
00:08:14 but any individual game of Nuclear Throne is not
00:08:17 because it was procedurally generated.
00:08:19 Then where is the art if every single run is not art?
00:08:22 Where is the art, then?
00:08:24 It's in the algorithm.
00:08:26 You just said, if anything, the algorithm should be the opposite of art
00:08:30 because the algorithm is the part that is procedurally generated.
00:08:34 I agree.
00:08:36 The algorithm is not procedurally generated.
00:08:38 The algorithm is static.
00:08:40 The instances that are derived from the algorithm.
00:08:42 The algorithm was crafted by a master craftsman.
00:08:46 God.
00:08:47 Yeah, God among men.
00:08:49 Well, there we go.
00:08:51 We solved nature.
00:08:52 Okay, okay.
00:08:54 Here's what I want to start this off with.
00:08:56 Here's my big point.
00:08:57 Just straight to the point.
00:08:58 Use my main weapon first.
00:09:00 I want to.
00:09:01 I like nature and stuff, but I know how I can make it better,
00:09:04 and here's what I want to institute across all the land.
00:09:07 I want to amusement parkify nature.
00:09:11 I like seeing trees.
00:09:13 I like to breathe, and I like seeing relatively small animals,
00:09:17 ones that cannot pose a threat to me.
00:09:19 Rabbit's a bit too big.
00:09:21 I want to see maybe a snake or something with no teeth.
00:09:23 That's what I like.
00:09:24 I want there to just be big sections of the nature,
00:09:29 forest, desert, whatever.
00:09:31 Completely taken over by man
00:09:35 and turned into nature light with all the edges smoothed
00:09:40 and there's pathways everywhere.
00:09:42 I want to walk into a forest on a street,
00:09:46 and I want to just walk on the street.
00:09:48 Have you ever been to Disneyland in the fucking...
00:09:51 What's his name?
00:09:52 The adventurer guy?
00:09:54 The guy with whip, that part?
00:09:55 You can just walk around and you're in a jungle type place.
00:09:58 I want to be in a jungle with roads.
00:10:01 Aren't these called parks?
00:10:02 I'm totally on your side here.
00:10:04 That's not nature enough.
00:10:06 I'm totally on your side here
00:10:08 because I think all you need to do,
00:10:11 this is the one stop solution to solving nature
00:10:15 and making it fucking awesome for everybody,
00:10:17 debug nature.
00:10:19 Yeah, I feel it.
00:10:20 And by that I mean remove the bugs.
00:10:23 That's what I meant by that.
00:10:26 You just need to remove all the bugs.
00:10:28 Nature's great.
00:10:30 The only but someone removed is mosquitoes.
00:10:33 No man, recently...
00:10:35 So during the summer time,
00:10:37 I moved into this new place up in fucking New York
00:10:40 and there's a bunch of paths near my house,
00:10:44 really nice paths through just the wilderness basically
00:10:48 that would be fun to run on every single day
00:10:51 if not for the fact that during the summer
00:10:53 it's completely full of these giant flies
00:10:56 that love just landing on you constantly.
00:10:59 So if you try to walk down this path,
00:11:01 you just constantly have flies landing on you
00:11:03 and it's so fucking maddening
00:11:05 that you can't even walk on it
00:11:07 and then in the winter it's completely covered in snow.
00:11:09 So basically it's useless.
00:11:11 I agree with you, though I want to have a slight compromise
00:11:15 because I love bugs.
00:11:17 I'm a big bug enthusiast
00:11:19 but I do agree that they are sin.
00:11:22 They are what makes bad things happen.
00:11:24 So here's what I want to propose.
00:11:26 Reduce the population of all bugs by 75%
00:11:31 but increase their size by double.
00:11:34 So you can walk into a cave somewhere
00:11:38 and those will be huge fucking beasts.
00:11:40 This is just going to be an RPG world
00:11:42 where every high step give a fucking giant fucking bug.
00:11:45 That's what I want.
00:11:47 I want bugs to be beasties.
00:11:49 This is how small and sneaky bugs are
00:11:51 so if we could annihilate that factor
00:11:53 it would be just less bugs
00:11:55 but they were all 100 times their size.
00:11:57 That would go a long way to making me more willing to accept them.
00:12:00 You want spiders big enough to eat you.
00:12:03 You want spiders big enough to consume you
00:12:05 to get trapped in a giant spider web.
00:12:07 She's right.
00:12:09 Bugs, there aren't insects.
00:12:11 They're still bugs.
00:12:13 I think they are. I would consider them bugs.
00:12:15 Bugs is cultural.
00:12:18 Bugs is culturally just defined.
00:12:20 If even a bunny could be considered bugs
00:12:22 then the door is wide open.
00:12:24 The term bugs is a social construct
00:12:27 made by fucking hominid overlords.
00:12:30 Yeah, yeah.
00:12:32 So what I'm saying is
00:12:37 I want to get a soda in a forest.
00:12:39 I want to walk through a forest.
00:12:41 I want there to be a sidewalk on there to be ropes.
00:12:43 I want to be able to walk over a ravine
00:12:45 and be like wow what a cool ravine
00:12:47 but I'll still have a gun.
00:12:49 There might be some torches nearby.
00:12:51 There might be some of that guided tendon.
00:12:53 I want to be able to kill any animal
00:12:55 that tries to defuse me.
00:12:57 There are places like this.
00:12:59 This is what a safari is.
00:13:01 Like Australia or something.
00:13:03 Yeah, but can I go to the safari two minutes from my house?
00:13:05 Actually I can because it is a safari zoo where I live.
00:13:07 But that doesn't count.
00:13:09 That's not true.
00:13:11 That doesn't count.
00:13:13 I want that to be every forest.
00:13:15 There's places like that that they build over like a marsh
00:13:18 where you can like walk on like a bunch of bridges and shit
00:13:21 and just be like whoa it's a marsh.
00:13:23 Sick dude.
00:13:25 That should just be all nature.
00:13:27 That should just be all nature.
00:13:29 Nature would just be better.
00:13:31 Actually I want to say that
00:13:33 it's interesting you mentioned that Munchie.
00:13:35 Like I'm imagining all of nature having paths
00:13:38 and basically it would just mean
00:13:40 that there was like roads everywhere.
00:13:42 Like the whole country would just be walkable.
00:13:44 So that would be fucking awesome
00:13:46 because I imagine like walking across country
00:13:49 would be fun if it weren't for the prospect of like
00:13:52 I have to either walk on the highway
00:13:54 or fucking navigate.
00:13:57 Nah man just everything's a road.
00:13:59 And there's beautiful scenic nature around you.
00:14:02 And then there's still
00:14:04 just one thing in nature.
00:14:06 I want this to be like 95% of nature.
00:14:09 What we're describing is just roads everywhere
00:14:11 and like little turnways you can go.
00:14:13 And also there should be danger zones.
00:14:15 Like killing me fuck you Jones.
00:14:17 Like for the high ranking adventurers
00:14:20 there would still be caves set off
00:14:22 if you want to die.
00:14:24 You want the world to be structured like an MMO.
00:14:26 Literally that's literally what I want.
00:14:28 I want there to be like high ranking zones
00:14:31 for if you get like a license if you apply at the DMV
00:14:33 you can get like a good boy haha rank
00:14:37 and you can go inside these devilish caves.
00:14:39 Those will kill you.
00:14:41 And touching on something I think is important.
00:14:43 I mean I like this idea for improving nature
00:14:45 but I think the single biggest thing
00:14:47 that nature is currently lacking is drops.
00:14:50 Like there just aren't that many drops in nature.
00:14:53 Well you know the problem is that nature
00:14:55 actually has quite a few drops
00:14:57 but they're very difficult to find.
00:14:59 They don't have enough, they haven't like
00:15:01 the designers did not put enough like
00:15:03 shimmy shines on them so they stand out
00:15:05 in the environment.
00:15:07 I don't think that nature was very well created
00:15:09 because the skinner box loop is not that effective
00:15:11 because the drops are so few and far between
00:15:13 and they don't come randomly.
00:15:15 They've all been collected at this point.
00:15:17 What is gold other than nature drops
00:15:19 and they've all been collected
00:15:21 and it's gone.
00:15:23 But when was the last time you got a gold drop?
00:15:25 I personally have never got one.
00:15:27 Look what we're, the problem is right now
00:15:29 is we're just waiting for this zone
00:15:31 this planet to reset
00:15:33 and that's when the next asteroid's going to hit
00:15:35 everything's going to reset.
00:15:37 Yeah, well in the current medicaid
00:15:39 in the current medicaid the drops are just
00:15:41 the drop rate is just so low that I just don't
00:15:43 feel engaged with the system.
00:15:45 It depends where you're grinding though.
00:15:47 Like if you go to like an apple orchard
00:15:49 in the autumn then
00:15:51 heck yeah.
00:15:53 I think it says
00:15:55 Is that someone building like a farm
00:15:57 on their land?
00:15:59 It's literally a farm.
00:16:01 It's more like harvest materials.
00:16:03 Yeah but I mean
00:16:05 you can get tons of drops there but you have to
00:16:07 build the farm.
00:16:09 You can't just wander through a random
00:16:11 forest and get tons of apple
00:16:13 You can get berries.
00:16:15 Yeah blueberries and
00:16:17 you can get mushrooms and stuff.
00:16:19 You know these are all good points.
00:16:21 I just want to say
00:16:23 by the way that I've got one of the best
00:16:25 rare drops of all time.
00:16:27 I'm just saying is my elated Arab
00:16:29 gentleman who just
00:16:31 literally sprung from nature.
00:16:33 That's a legendary drop.
00:16:35 Oh okay okay did you
00:16:37 I wanted to say that story immediately
00:16:39 but instead of immediately afternate
00:16:41 please say that story.
00:16:43 You know what I'm going to launch you the whole thing so you should just go first.
00:16:45 Oh okay okay did you.
00:16:47 I remember the first time you told me this story
00:16:49 I was in a fucking Skype call with your ex-girlfriend
00:16:51 and it was the most
00:16:53 it made me elated.
00:16:55 It was the most ingenious and incredible thing I've ever heard in my fucking life.
00:16:57 It was a story arc and I still have
00:16:59 the file of the image you sent me
00:17:01 ladies and gentlemen.
00:17:03 Call the video games are dead on my computer right now.
00:17:05 I still have it.
00:17:07 Well since I was trying to remember
00:17:09 where I had told this story before
00:17:11 it was only in a patron exclusive podcast
00:17:13 so I guess I could tell it here.
00:17:15 So it's a simple story
00:17:17 one day I was
00:17:19 at some function
00:17:21 my mom had to go to the school and I went with her
00:17:23 I had to walk home basically it was like a long walk
00:17:25 like a two hour walk
00:17:27 and I was just like fucking I want to walk
00:17:29 and walk and home
00:17:31 and I'm on the side of the road
00:17:33 in the middle of an area where
00:17:35 it's just forest on the side of the road
00:17:37 like a 45 mile an hour road in forest
00:17:39 and on the side of the road is this
00:17:41 giant cardboard cut out
00:17:43 of what can only be described as
00:17:45 an elated Arab gentleman holding a cell phone
00:17:47 looking like the most
00:17:49 most relieved.
00:17:51 Yeah a flip phone and he's got like the most
00:17:53 relieved face in the whole world
00:17:55 he looks like he just finally got reception
00:17:57 but he's like literally wearing
00:17:59 like a turban and shit
00:18:01 so I just find this cardboard cut out
00:18:03 and it's only the top half of his body
00:18:05 just sitting on the side of the road
00:18:07 and there's no possible
00:18:09 building it could have come from nearby
00:18:11 like it wasn't close enough to anything
00:18:13 so it had to have come out of the back
00:18:15 of someone's car or something
00:18:17 or just been thrown there
00:18:19 but I don't know the source because there's no
00:18:21 labels on it
00:18:23 I assume it's from like a sprint store
00:18:25 it's a sprint on his phone
00:18:27 but I mean yeah
00:18:29 I just picked it up and I took it home with me
00:18:31 and nailed it to my wall
00:18:33 and that's now one of my most prized presentations
00:18:35 That's incredible
00:18:37 You can click on the link in the show notes
00:18:39 to see the image
00:18:41 we're talking about TV
00:18:43 oh boy
00:18:45 Nate please I beg of you
00:18:47 we are at your will and we have bent our knee
00:18:49 please
00:18:51 here's what I wanted to talk about
00:18:53 I just want to say be right back
00:18:55 someone's like knocking on my fucking window
00:18:57 alright kill that gremlin
00:18:59 I've never heard me say fuck
00:19:01 that's nice
00:19:03 I wanted to bring up
00:19:05 I recently saw a video by a guy I quite like
00:19:07 on YouTube it's one of my ASMR boys
00:19:09 this guy named Ephemeral Rift
00:19:11 and just listen to the name of this video
00:19:13 ok here's what it is
00:19:15 we belong in nature
00:19:17 in parenthesis civilization
00:19:19 is cancer
00:19:21 that is the full name of this video
00:19:23 I hate this guy already
00:19:25 listen he's very woke
00:19:27 on a lot of issues but he is an absolute
00:19:29 seems super woke
00:19:31 he's incredibly woke
00:19:33 he is
00:19:35 he is like the biggest
00:19:37 and narcos communist that I've like ever encountered
00:19:39 in my travels
00:19:41 and it is very unfortunate
00:19:43 ok so this whole video
00:19:45 you can go watch and ok you will see this video
00:19:47 if you go search his channel we belong in nature civilization is cancer
00:19:49 it will be in the show notes
00:19:51 there will definitely be a link in the show notes
00:19:53 I have a gigantic comment that I left
00:19:55 on this video
00:19:57 under best guy ever
00:19:59 you'll be able to see it there
00:20:01 so he basically talks for
00:20:03 extended period of time
00:20:05 it's like an hour and a half long
00:20:07 and that's fine
00:20:09 of why
00:20:11 human civilization has gone too far
00:20:13 and we have strayed away from like
00:20:15 what he might be totally right about
00:20:17 look we right now
00:20:19 are all like lonely people
00:20:21 we're too capitalist
00:20:23 everyone cares about that
00:20:25 we can all agree with that name
00:20:27 we're all too capitalist
00:20:29 there are issues here
00:20:31 but basically his point is we should
00:20:33 literally all be living in nature
00:20:35 we should be living in like small tribes
00:20:37 the way that we did originally
00:20:39 and it is his idea that we should
00:20:41 really go back there
00:20:43 and he's woke man he accepts the fact
00:20:45 that there are problems with that
00:20:47 it's not going to be easy
00:20:49 but he thinks that is the best way to go
00:20:51 and of course in my comment
00:20:53 I point out
00:20:55 what seems to me like blisteringly obvious facts
00:20:57 like okay well
00:20:59 before we had like civilization
00:21:01 a lot of people died from diseases that we now have
00:21:03 curious for
00:21:05 so what about all that
00:21:07 do you want like all these pregnant women
00:21:09 to just die in childbirth
00:21:11 because you know
00:21:13 civilization he's talking about would be great
00:21:15 for like jaded guys like him
00:21:17 who are really fed up with their nine to five
00:21:19 jobs and this guy's a very successful youtuber
00:21:21 he's too fed up with being way too
00:21:23 wait wait wait wait wait wait
00:21:25 Nate I need to interject here
00:21:27 because I have no idea what this ephemeral rift is
00:21:29 let me show you a screencap from the video
00:21:31 but go on
00:21:33 so he's a successful youtuber
00:21:35 he possibly makes his living off youtube
00:21:37 and his solution is to get rid of
00:21:39 all civilization
00:21:41 in a cave and like
00:21:43 the entire way that he's
00:21:45 being able to broadcast this message
00:21:47 he's spiting
00:21:49 this guy looks like ben sates cartoon
00:21:51 avatar of himself but with a beard
00:21:53 let me see this
00:21:55 literally
00:21:57 oh my god
00:21:59 ben gets old this will just be ben
00:22:01 it kinda does
00:22:03 I am interested
00:22:05 on ephemeral rift
00:22:07 I am in no way trying to shit on this guy
00:22:09 he just looks like ben saint
00:22:11 with a grey beard
00:22:13 this will also be in the show
00:22:15 it's better than mine
00:22:17 I just want to make it clear to the audience
00:22:19 I think I'm changing my mind
00:22:21 I think I'm going over to this guy's side
00:22:23 I think me and him are just gonna go live in a hut somewhere
00:22:25 I literally like ephemeral rift a lot
00:22:27 nobody go bully him
00:22:29 or say shit to him
00:22:31 but politely disagree if you do so
00:22:33 after watching the video
00:22:35 don't even just take my word for it
00:22:37 but it's an hour and a half long
00:22:39 this guy's sentiment
00:22:41 so many people put this idea
00:22:43 of nature
00:22:45 and old human civilization
00:22:47 on such a pedestal
00:22:49 exactly and to me it is
00:22:51 clearly because guys like this
00:22:53 I've watched this guy for years
00:22:55 I know his full backstory
00:22:57 he had to work a shitty 9-5
00:22:59 to get himself to a place where he could support
00:23:01 his wife and kid
00:23:03 he's pretty depressed
00:23:05 he sees all the flaws
00:23:07 in modern civilization
00:23:09 he's very woke on all those issues
00:23:11 but what he's not focusing on enough
00:23:13 in my humble opinion
00:23:15 is the way that millions of people died
00:23:17 in extremely preventable ways
00:23:19 in the olden days
00:23:21 and I do not think we're necessarily better off
00:23:23 just throwing away all the modern advancements
00:23:25 that's what I'm saying the nature metagame is broken
00:23:27 we had to update it
00:23:29 people are so obsessed
00:23:31 with the aesthetic
00:23:33 and the romanticization of nature
00:23:35 and it's like oh modern society
00:23:37 has all these problems we need to go back
00:23:39 that's the equivalent of saying
00:23:41 modern society has all these problems
00:23:43 we need to magnify them exponentially
00:23:45 literal romanticism
00:23:47 it's disgusting
00:23:49 we need to go forward further
00:23:51 we're in an incompleteness
00:23:53 my guys are not maturely looking
00:23:55 at how to deal with these issues
00:23:57 I think we can all agree
00:23:59 I don't think we all need to fight
00:24:01 hard on the side of civilization
00:24:03 should exist
00:24:05 opinion is rather extreme
00:24:07 but the guys like this are more
00:24:09 rampant than I'm comfortable with
00:24:11 they are more out there
00:24:13 you're more rampant than I'm comfortable with
00:24:15 I don't think we need to
00:24:17 throw the baby out with the bath water
00:24:19 and be like oh fuck nature
00:24:21 just because we favor civilization
00:24:23 but I'm not saying that
00:24:25 I'm just saying that these kind of hyperbolic
00:24:27 extreme nature worshipers
00:24:29 that's not the solution either
00:24:31 it's not where we should be going
00:24:33 my understanding is
00:24:35 if you want to say
00:24:37 human civilization was a misstep
00:24:39 retarded but okay you can say that
00:24:41 if you want to propose that we go
00:24:43 back to nature
00:24:45 after having cultivated these cities
00:24:47 if you want to be like
00:24:49 practical and then say go back to nature now
00:24:51 that is probably the most stupid
00:24:53 fucking idea I've ever heard besides
00:24:55 being a porn manga artist in under a month
00:24:57 that
00:24:59 the population is way down
00:25:01 I never said anything like that
00:25:05 the population is way too high
00:25:07 and I don't want to be one of those guys
00:25:09 but we've done things to this planet
00:25:11 that we can't really come back
00:25:13 from it would be weird to go back
00:25:15 you know what the thing is dude
00:25:17 and try and be tribes again
00:25:19 I don't believe
00:25:21 that this guy actually believes this
00:25:23 I think he's trying to put on airs
00:25:25 while complaining because there's nothing
00:25:27 stopping anybody from just going and living
00:25:29 in nature you can just drop off the face
00:25:31 of the planet people do that
00:25:33 if you want to go just go do it
00:25:35 just go take your family and do it but he's like
00:25:37 no man that's these fucking commies man
00:25:39 they want like they need
00:25:41 everyone to do their shit or it's a fucking
00:25:43 problem no one's stopping you motherfucker
00:25:45 just go do it stop trying to drag
00:25:47 everybody else down with you oh my god it
00:25:49 fucking pisses me off and I disagree
00:25:51 with literally none of the complaints that he makes
00:25:53 in his video I agree with 100%
00:25:55 of them but the his proposed solution
00:25:57 is retarded is completely retarded
00:25:59 agreed well I I want to almost as retarded
00:26:01 as nature itself I want to get
00:26:03 on to talking about nature in a positive
00:26:05 way because I'm looking at the background
00:26:07 of this guy's video I like nature
00:26:09 and you know did you you're the problem
00:26:11 you're romanticizing aesthetic that
00:26:13 looks pretty aesthetic is everything
00:26:15 if you if nature is good because
00:26:17 it has a good aesthetic nature is great because it is because it's like
00:26:19 I know it's like you can see it can be like
00:26:21 I'm not saying nature's good you're saying aesthetics
00:26:23 are good and I agree but actually
00:26:25 being there is awful
00:26:27 looking at it great
00:26:29 being there is shit
00:26:31 I think the aesthetic of nature is felt 10
00:26:33 times stronger by being like
00:26:35 especially of a forest like this like
00:26:37 this shit when you see these in images
00:26:39 they all look exactly the same because every forest
00:26:41 is the same shit especially if you're in a forest
00:26:43 that's like in town it's probably
00:26:45 what I refer to as a septic forest
00:26:47 where it's basically
00:26:49 just a small creek that is where all
00:26:51 of the fucking septic tanks empty
00:26:53 out and then like
00:26:55 just a bunch of fucking trees
00:26:57 you know for and like a narrow probably
00:26:59 a narrow strip like you can't ever get deep enough
00:27:01 to not hear cars but that's like
00:27:03 most of the forest in like suburban
00:27:05 America and I use the high level
00:27:07 mob spawn because the excess of toxicity
00:27:09 you know yeah I used to explore
00:27:11 those forests all the time when I was a kid
00:27:13 and just like play with sticks and fucking
00:27:15 you know pretend they were samurai
00:27:17 swords and cut trees
00:27:19 fun times you know
00:27:21 back before iPhones that's what
00:27:23 you had to do I never
00:27:25 had an iPhone but
00:27:27 the forests were
00:27:29 like you know I would just go
00:27:31 exploring with my friends and that was some of
00:27:33 my like most memorable times because
00:27:35 I grew up real sheltered and like exploring
00:27:37 a forest was like whoa I'm on it
00:27:39 fucking I'm doing something away from
00:27:41 home I'm fucking getting out
00:27:43 but you know
00:27:45 it's like 5 feet away
00:27:47 it doesn't make you puke, it doesn't make you fucking cough and gag
00:27:49 wherever you stand you can go out there
00:27:51 you can fucking breathe, you can see green
00:27:53 occasionally you'll come across like some like creepy bug
00:27:55 you'll be like ew and then you'll touch it and poke it a lot
00:27:57 dude I mean the first time I ever went out
00:27:59 to the mountains and like stayed in a log cabin
00:28:01 out in the mountains and
00:28:03 heard nothing because it's just
00:28:05 quiet and you're just like what the fuck this is
00:28:07 it didn't even feel like the same earth
00:28:09 like I didn't know that like
00:28:11 reality was supposed to be quieter
00:28:13 nature can be very enjoyable
00:28:15 have you guys spent a lot of time camping
00:28:17 because in my youth
00:28:19 yeah it's miserable
00:28:21 I actually love camping
00:28:23 it's just kind of a big work
00:28:25 I want to get through my
00:28:27 forest aesthetics thing because here's how I
00:28:29 enjoy the forest camp
00:28:31 I got into exploring as a kid just because it's fun
00:28:33 but later I got into black metal
00:28:35 and like atmosphere
00:28:37 the same thing really
00:28:39 well almost all black metal is like about
00:28:41 how beautiful nature is
00:28:43 and destroying human society
00:28:45 and organized religion in particular
00:28:47 and like paganism
00:28:49 and shit so like
00:28:51 if you listen to like Agiloch all their fucking songs
00:28:53 are just like about fuck
00:28:55 like one of their songs probably the most famous
00:28:57 which is called
00:28:59 in the shadow of our pale companion
00:29:01 is a song
00:29:03 that is just about a guy wandering
00:29:05 in the forest having an existential crisis
00:29:07 and like so if you're ever wandering
00:29:09 in the forest having an existential crisis
00:29:11 and you put on this 14 minute Agiloch song
00:29:13 while you walk around it's like the most
00:29:15 aesthetic experience you can have
00:29:17 in your hometown
00:29:19 is this pale companion white privilege
00:29:21 that you need to smash
00:29:23 I think it's God
00:29:25 well same difference I guess
00:29:27 I've actually
00:29:29 listened to
00:29:31 I've listened to another album about
00:29:33 like fucking angry white men from
00:29:35 Seattle getting angry and putting on silly
00:29:37 voices talking about how cool nature is
00:29:39 that I also did like by Kithkin
00:29:41 rituals, trances and exesies for humans
00:29:43 in the face of claps that look that up right now
00:29:45 actually click on the link of that that was good
00:29:47 and I liked that that was also
00:29:49 fucking twinks from Seattle doing funny voices
00:29:51 Agiloch from Portland thank you very much
00:29:53 so
00:29:55 literally this name one difference
00:29:57 between Seattle, Washington and Portland more again
00:29:59 Portland is weird
00:30:01 so is Seattle
00:30:03 amount of homeless people
00:30:05 that is true
00:30:07 if I have the floor for a couple minutes
00:30:09 here I would like to talk
00:30:11 about my sixth grade camp
00:30:13 because my sixth grade camp
00:30:15 was the worst week of my entire
00:30:17 fucking life
00:30:19 I'm just going to explain what sixth grade camp is
00:30:21 for the people who don't know maybe live in shit
00:30:23 countries like America
00:30:25 or you know bridge
00:30:27 like that disgusting
00:30:29 so okay sixth grade camp is you enter sixth grade
00:30:31 and then you go on a camping trip somewhere around
00:30:33 the beginning of your year to
00:30:35 accomplish nothing really it's just fun
00:30:37 I guess so I come there
00:30:39 and the entire like week before
00:30:41 I'm dragging it because you know I'm a
00:30:43 role player on the internet and I don't have time for
00:30:45 things like trees or bees or any sort of
00:30:47 bullshit like that I don't want to leave
00:30:49 my precious laptop and all my malware
00:30:51 written fucking like at least
00:30:53 web browsers I don't want to do that
00:30:55 but I'm forced I'm forced to
00:30:57 I'm forced to so I have to go
00:30:59 I get on the bus we go there and we're in the middle
00:31:01 of fucking nowhere
00:31:03 and it's all fucking scary and and all
00:31:05 we do besides
00:31:07 sitting cafeterias where there's like no electricity
00:31:09 it's all fucking bull you know electricity
00:31:11 that I can use that there's it's all
00:31:13 horrible food it makes me fucking
00:31:15 sad and what we do day and
00:31:17 day fucking out is we hike
00:31:19 we hike through fucking treacherous
00:31:21 mountains if they're dangerous
00:31:23 fucking you know pathways
00:31:25 I see I see like a bear at one point
00:31:27 I see I see what are the dog looking things
00:31:29 I see one of the dog looking things
00:31:31 cats that's where they are big cats
00:31:33 yeah and it's fucking
00:31:35 terrifying but but I came
00:31:37 to an epiphany of why I was there
00:31:39 I looked around and like you know because
00:31:41 I was a fat kid I was always behind and I was
00:31:43 lagging behind I needed more water than the rest of the people
00:31:45 so I was drinking and sweating so but
00:31:47 I came to realization that that
00:31:49 around me was
00:31:51 pretty I liked it
00:31:53 but I just needed roads
00:31:55 I needed civilization
00:31:57 to assist me
00:31:59 in observing nature
00:32:01 I liked being out in the hot
00:32:03 blistering Arabian Californian
00:32:05 sun I like that but I wanted to do it on my own
00:32:07 terms and as a human
00:32:09 my own terms was destroying
00:32:11 all of the genuine sincerity of it
00:32:13 and making it like an amusement park I needed
00:32:15 concession stands I needed
00:32:17 roads I needed fucking torches I need
00:32:19 tour guides if I had that
00:32:21 then this would be great if I
00:32:23 didn't have to like use my legs
00:32:25 well not as a not walking
00:32:27 if I didn't have to like jump up and like
00:32:29 fucking cross ravines and fucking you know
00:32:31 jump as far as I fucking could
00:32:33 then that would be great if I could just walk
00:32:35 places it would be perfect so
00:32:37 like I like nature I
00:32:39 like seeing the dog things
00:32:41 I like seeing trees I like to be able to look
00:32:43 up mountains and be like wow that's a mountain
00:32:45 but I don't like being in
00:32:47 danger and being scared the
00:32:49 worst thing in fucking sixth grade camp was
00:32:51 like the second to last night where like we had
00:32:53 to like walk in the dark we didn't
00:32:55 we didn't hike this time we like we like
00:32:57 walked to a nearby museum
00:32:59 but this nearby museum was like like through
00:33:01 a bean off road
00:33:03 path and by road I just mean like
00:33:05 there's slightly a section of
00:33:07 this like grassland that does not have grass
00:33:09 on it it is just dirt it's not
00:33:11 an actual road it's just you know dirt
00:33:13 and the tour guide
00:33:15 we had like a guy you know we were all babies
00:33:17 but he didn't do anything he was just like yeah there are like
00:33:19 snakes around here so if you see a snake well
00:33:21 bye and it was
00:33:23 terrified because it was in the dead of night
00:33:25 and you walk for like a fucking mile to get this
00:33:27 stupid museum and just look at dead things
00:33:29 I hate dead things I want to be alive
00:33:31 and that's why I hate dangerous things and that's why I hate nature
00:33:33 I mean you live in California
00:33:35 and there's a bear just on the flag
00:33:37 of California like
00:33:39 bears are real and they're just in the
00:33:41 woods they're out there they are
00:33:43 out there yeah like
00:33:45 they just are ready to kill yeah they'll just
00:33:47 come to you and murder you it happens
00:33:49 it happens that's not that's the state
00:33:51 of nature and it's awful and should be
00:33:53 abolished but if we had roads
00:33:55 and torches and guns
00:33:57 nature would have to
00:33:59 bend to us yeah
00:34:01 I don't and that's my proposal look
00:34:03 no no no you I think people have a lot of
00:34:05 human guilt and so they feel like
00:34:07 oh no I'm oppressing these bears uh
00:34:09 fuck them kill them don't care they can
00:34:11 die look this is what we need to understand
00:34:13 about nature do you remember like a few days
00:34:15 ago that that did you see that the
00:34:17 story that was going around on Twitter of
00:34:19 the lady who kept pulling worms out of her
00:34:21 eyes yeah
00:34:23 there was this lady who had to end up going
00:34:25 to the hospital because she kept pulling she felt
00:34:27 something wriggling around in her
00:34:29 eye and and she
00:34:31 could see it so she got
00:34:33 it oh and she pulled out of
00:34:35 your stories like that worms out
00:34:37 of her eyes and
00:34:39 they had they had to surgically remove like
00:34:41 12 of them from inside of her
00:34:43 eye and the reason it was so
00:34:45 fucking terrifying is because there was a parasite
00:34:47 that does this that before this
00:34:49 case we thought didn't
00:34:51 affect humans
00:34:53 oh that someone said had
00:34:55 some intersex of her
00:34:57 that is nature okay
00:34:59 fucking
00:35:01 and her name was wife of undertale
00:35:03 yes exactly
00:35:05 so so so this is what
00:35:07 nature is nature is like
00:35:09 you know fucking like arachnids that
00:35:11 that capture things and then like
00:35:13 inject them with like
00:35:15 like fucking poison that melts their organs
00:35:17 from the inside out and they drink them up
00:35:19 this is nature
00:35:21 nature is fucking tornadoes
00:35:23 isn't that kind of cool
00:35:25 for a moment while we're on this topic
00:35:27 because I don't want to I don't want to
00:35:29 trail off from this topic and then be
00:35:31 and relevant and here on this
00:35:33 topic so there's also like
00:35:35 these maggot things that eat rotten
00:35:37 flesh but they're used
00:35:39 medicinally so that to save people's
00:35:41 like limbs and stuff to
00:35:43 like because
00:35:45 they're put on on the rotten flesh to
00:35:47 eat it away and they do it so cleanly
00:35:49 that you don't have to like hack off the whole limb
00:35:51 you just you just get rid of the rotten
00:35:53 flesh and stuff so in that sense
00:35:55 those sort of things help
00:35:57 and leeches to help in the
00:35:59 back in the days and I think there's still
00:36:01 parts of the world where they still use leeches
00:36:03 medicinally and stuff
00:36:05 nature has things about it that are useful
00:36:07 and and and that I wouldn't
00:36:09 say that we shouldn't throw the baby out with the
00:36:11 bathwater but it just
00:36:13 it's not reaching its full potential on its own
00:36:15 it's just so much of a waste
00:36:17 also garlic is like the universal
00:36:19 of antibiotic
00:36:21 I thought you were going to say anti-vampire
00:36:23 and I was just like
00:36:25 you got me there mage
00:36:27 I want to start up a debate
00:36:29 with all of you about
00:36:31 the word nature and more specifically
00:36:33 the word natural
00:36:35 I want to know where you draw the line
00:36:37 between what is natural and what is unnatural
00:36:39 because
00:36:41 when we talk about like natural foods for instance
00:36:43 like they always advertise themselves
00:36:45 like oh this is natural
00:36:47 which means that whatever is not this
00:36:49 is not natural but like
00:36:51 what is added to the so called
00:36:53 unnatural version it's like it could just be
00:36:55 pesticides or like
00:36:57 you know something something else so
00:36:59 they even
00:37:01 even if you get a non GMO
00:37:03 apple which GMOs
00:37:05 like into that bullshit but even if you like
00:37:07 you know a pure apple untouched
00:37:09 if you get them today
00:37:11 in the year 2018
00:37:13 that is not a natural
00:37:15 apple that is a man made
00:37:17 construction even in its
00:37:19 most basic form we have domesticated
00:37:21 apples and pigs and stuff so even if you like
00:37:23 get a pig and be like I want to roll around the dirt
00:37:25 with a fucking pig that's not natural
00:37:27 people don't do that stop so you'll contraire
00:37:29 my friend I'm just curious would you say
00:37:31 you lean
00:37:33 more towards less things should be
00:37:35 considered natural or more things should be
00:37:37 considered natural because for me
00:37:39 I feel like I feel like
00:37:41 you know people talk about for instance
00:37:43 plastics and they're like
00:37:45 oh that's man made
00:37:47 and I'm like well no it comes from a plant
00:37:49 like plastic is originally
00:37:51 I think when people use natural
00:37:53 obviously know that
00:37:55 when people use natural in that sense
00:37:57 they're saying things that don't naturally like
00:37:59 things that don't occur without
00:38:01 having to be produced in some way
00:38:03 by man
00:38:05 let me say about plastics
00:38:07 things about plastics though
00:38:09 like if you put them on the ground
00:38:11 they don't go away
00:38:13 and they hurt the environment so it's not natural
00:38:15 in that sense like something
00:38:17 it can't reproduce
00:38:19 it can't continue without humans
00:38:21 but yeah kind I guess
00:38:23 but also like
00:38:25 you have to be careful about
00:38:27 what you throw away because you might think
00:38:29 oh banana peel is natural and you throw it away
00:38:31 oh you know it's not going to do anything
00:38:33 but that's the thing if you throw it away on
00:38:35 ground that doesn't naturally grow
00:38:37 bananas and stuff like you know
00:38:39 I don't know in America certain parts of America
00:38:41 you can't grow bananas
00:38:43 it's not really good for the environment because
00:38:45 the thing doesn't naturally
00:38:47 occur there so it's not natural for a banana peel
00:38:49 to just appear there so it's hurting
00:38:51 the environment as well
00:38:53 not as much as plastic though but
00:38:55 you have to be careful about those things
00:38:57 I mean life finds a way
00:38:59 you know plants will just
00:39:01 plants will grow and plants would grow
00:39:03 in just fields
00:39:05 just littered with plastic shrapnel
00:39:07 that was the only choice we've spoiled them
00:39:09 we've spoiled them
00:39:11 we made them soft
00:39:13 there's already some sort of bacteria
00:39:15 or something that does and I was reading another story
00:39:17 about like intranobal there's like fungus that
00:39:19 like break down radioactive material
00:39:21 see they're like intranobal though
00:39:23 I think the problem is the reason
00:39:25 the earth hasn't like adapted to our trash yet
00:39:27 is we haven't given it enough
00:39:29 like we got to train the earth
00:39:31 we got to dump as much trash
00:39:33 everywhere so that all the plants can learn how to
00:39:35 take care of it
00:39:37 I'm playing the long game
00:39:39 I feel like only weeds would survive
00:39:41 at that point
00:39:43 how long have plastics even existed
00:39:45 like maybe 200 years in the entire
00:39:47 lifetime of the planet earth
00:39:49 real quick question
00:39:51 real quick nature question for you guys
00:39:53 what is wrong with weeds
00:39:55 why are they worse than not
00:39:57 weeds
00:39:59 it's just because they're not what we want
00:40:01 they're hoggers for the most part
00:40:03 yeah they strangle like the growth of other crops
00:40:05 and also it's just an aesthetic problem
00:40:07 because they look different from the grass
00:40:09 because like all plant like all life
00:40:11 strangles out and chokes out other life
00:40:13 in order to eke out its own existence
00:40:15 what makes a thing a weed is
00:40:17 that's nature itself
00:40:19 that's the position you people are arguing for
00:40:21 strangling out all around you
00:40:23 is it that weeds have
00:40:25 really aggressive genes
00:40:27 like weeds will overpopulate
00:40:29 an area and turn it
00:40:31 into not good plants anymore
00:40:33 yeah that's the thing like weeds
00:40:35 most of the time they're not useful
00:40:37 for humans and they also
00:40:39 they're very aggressive and they kill
00:40:41 other plants so they can repopulate
00:40:43 so they're very invasive
00:40:45 and stuff though on that point
00:40:47 dandelions can be useful in many ways
00:40:49 and I don't think they should be considered
00:40:51 weeds necessarily though they are a bit aggressive
00:40:53 according to Wikipedia
00:40:55 a weed is just a plant considered
00:40:57 undesirable in a particular situation
00:40:59 there we go there we go that's what I'm saying
00:41:01 I googled
00:41:03 invention of plastics to try and get
00:41:05 like the date of when plastics were invented
00:41:07 and the first google result is
00:41:09 invention of plastics by man is a crime
00:41:11 alright I have a very
00:41:13 whoa I have a very important
00:41:15 suggestion which is that
00:41:17 we all adopt weeds
00:41:19 as a new racial slur
00:41:21 and it just applies
00:41:23 no it applies to all
00:41:25 races it's just
00:41:27 whoever you don't want in the room at the moment
00:41:29 is the weeds
00:41:31 they gotta pull the weeds out of this room
00:41:33 makes perfect sense
00:41:35 I fucking like that
00:41:37 I might cop a feel on that
00:41:39 I don't really know about
00:41:41 the word weed for something else though
00:41:43 there's too many meanings for weed now
00:41:45 well the great thing about
00:41:47 using weed is that you don't have to use
00:41:49 any specific racial slur because it'll be
00:41:51 understood like let's say you're in a room
00:41:53 with your friend you're at a party
00:41:55 there's a couple of Jews at your party
00:41:57 and you want to tell your friend
00:41:59 that we need to get rid of the Jews
00:42:01 but you don't want the people around you to know
00:42:03 what race of people you think needs to be
00:42:05 removed from the party so you just say
00:42:07 we need to pull the weeds and your friend
00:42:09 who is also an anti-semite
00:42:11 will know exactly what you're talking about
00:42:13 or they can all assume that you mean
00:42:15 like it's time to pull out some weed
00:42:17 and smoke it because
00:42:19 no no you would never say weeds
00:42:21 with an S if you were talking about smoking weed
00:42:23 well maybe they're
00:42:25 stupid no one refers to a plural
00:42:27 of weed it could also be used
00:42:29 for not racist attributes as well
00:42:31 it could also be used for that if you wanted to
00:42:33 it could be like you know if you're
00:42:35 in the room with some fucking black person
00:42:37 oh damn it
00:42:39 never mind
00:42:41 it's a lost cause
00:42:43 I mean what's important about the term weed
00:42:45 is that it is complete well like
00:42:47 it's like George Carlin said
00:42:49 people say like the earth is dying
00:42:51 like ah the earth is dying but no
00:42:53 the earth is just an inanimate object
00:42:55 full of life and what we really mean
00:42:57 when we say that is we are making our environment
00:42:59 uninhabitable for ourselves
00:43:01 the planet's gonna be fine
00:43:03 the people are fucked
00:43:05 it's just a hot rock
00:43:07 indeed indeed it's dumb when people
00:43:09 like the earth cries out in pain no
00:43:11 like it's this thing about I hate how people
00:43:13 like make it all about something else
00:43:15 when they're actually talking selfishly
00:43:17 like I'm 100% willing to admit
00:43:19 I only care about the earth
00:43:21 in context of like human civilization
00:43:23 and my own you know environment
00:43:25 around me and the environment of people who I care about
00:43:27 a little bit that's what matters
00:43:29 that's what matters I don't care if like
00:43:31 in 10 billion years
00:43:33 we have all ported our civilization
00:43:35 to Mars and the earth just explodes
00:43:37 like well that's a shame that's too bad
00:43:39 but I don't actually care at all
00:43:41 I would be upset
00:43:43 if the earth just spontaneously
00:43:45 was like gone and you know
00:43:47 we were alive elsewhere on Mars
00:43:49 I mean it would be a bummer but I get over it
00:43:51 but the point is that's not the most important thing
00:43:53 I wouldn't be dead
00:43:55 the important thing is humans being alive
00:43:57 that's what actually matters and furthering civilization
00:43:59 etc etc
00:44:01 that's what actually matters
00:44:03 that's why ephemeral rift is a very silly boy
00:44:05 I can see him hiding in the
00:44:07 the Martian bushes
00:44:09 out in the nowhere in a Martian loincloth
00:44:11 having a good time
00:44:13 hey Nate, Tom, you people I know this
00:44:15 like is there a way
00:44:17 to make Mars green is that like a thing
00:44:19 that can happen or will it always be the way it is
00:44:21 I mean
00:44:23 we don't know how to do it
00:44:25 but we want to
00:44:27 but literally like could there be a way
00:44:29 you'd have to introduce like
00:44:31 different gases into the atmosphere
00:44:33 and do a bunch of other stuff
00:44:35 guys, guys
00:44:37 speaking about planets, have you heard about a planet that like
00:44:39 it can sort of be inhabitable
00:44:41 by human life but only like on a
00:44:43 various sliver sort of of it
00:44:45 because it doesn't rotate so one side is too hot
00:44:47 the other is too cold
00:44:49 and there's like one slip
00:44:51 that's just perfect but it's in constant
00:44:53 like twilight so like
00:44:55 I think that the like it looks
00:44:57 kind of like hell because
00:44:59 awesome, Star Wars
00:45:01 that's so cool
00:45:05 that's my home planet
00:45:07 the hot ease and the cold ease
00:45:09 on the opposite sides of the planet
00:45:11 that's exactly what I was going to say
00:45:13 because there would be people who would go on the dark side
00:45:15 of that planet no matter what
00:45:17 so there would totally be a class divide
00:45:19 because you know they would ship all of their fucking
00:45:21 groveling street urges to the dark side
00:45:23 and be like a fucking darky just came to life
00:45:25 like you know what we going to fucking dark us down here
00:45:27 get these fucking weeds out of here
00:45:29 yeah exactly
00:45:31 that would be great
00:45:33 we've brushed up upon and what
00:45:35 will now be the big thing we argue about
00:45:37 is environmentalism
00:45:39 and the planet and global warming
00:45:41 and Al Gore did he invent the internet
00:45:43 yes or no
00:45:45 probably yes
00:45:47 who else would be smart enough to invent the internet
00:45:49 I don't know anybody
00:45:51 so what
00:45:53 what level of
00:45:55 commitment and responsibility
00:45:57 do humans have
00:45:59 to take care of the planet
00:46:01 do we have any responsibility
00:46:03 or is it just all like we should do this for our own sake
00:46:05 or do we have
00:46:07 do we have anything to give back to the planet
00:46:09 is there any sort of moral
00:46:11 or virtuous argument that can be made
00:46:13 we should take care of the bone
00:46:15 like why
00:46:17 I mean I like earth
00:46:19 it's good if we have to live here
00:46:21 forever we should take care of it
00:46:23 but like
00:46:25 this is gonna die one way or another
00:46:27 like everything else
00:46:29 fuck it
00:46:31 yeah
00:46:33 tossing the garbage
00:46:35 I think it's very important
00:46:37 we're not gonna be ported to Mars
00:46:39 our whole civilization for a very long time
00:46:41 if we make that shit happen
00:46:43 so I would say it's pretty important
00:46:45 that we take care of the earth
00:46:47 I'm actually pretty pro environmentalism
00:46:49 but at the same time you have to consider
00:46:51 it is true that you don't want your
00:46:53 completely crush your
00:46:55 economic development
00:46:57 who here will always walk all the way
00:46:59 to the trash can to throw something away
00:47:01 me
00:47:03 I always do
00:47:05 I pocket my trash and I wait
00:47:07 until I find a trash can
00:47:09 you mean as opposed to just throwing it on the ground
00:47:11 I mean I just leave it all over my desk
00:47:13 it makes its way to the trash
00:47:15 eventually
00:47:17 I think you were talking about making sweet long range dunks
00:47:19 of my trash
00:47:21 I'm totally doing that
00:47:23 I'm saying when you're out
00:47:25 if you're out somewhere and you've got trash
00:47:27 and there's not a trash can anywhere around
00:47:29 well you carry that shit around until you find a trash can
00:47:31 yeah absolutely
00:47:33 anyone who doesn't is a fucking asshole
00:47:35 okay so everyone in here is a real good boy
00:47:37 what about cigarette butts
00:47:39 would you throw the I mean I don't know if anybody
00:47:41 um
00:47:43 you even have to consider that cigarette butts don't count in the same category
00:47:45 already makes you a bad person right off the bat
00:47:47 I'm just asking
00:47:49 I'm just asking how all of you feel
00:47:51 Nate or Ben would you toss a cigarette butt on the ground
00:47:53 I would toss a cigarette butt like on a sidewalk
00:47:55 I would toss it
00:47:57 in like an urban area
00:47:59 at least stomp on it because I
00:48:01 there's nothing more than I hate
00:48:03 I just hate it
00:48:05 when people throw down like lit cigarettes
00:48:07 on the ground
00:48:09 and they almost stomp it out
00:48:11 fire on the sidewalk
00:48:13 you degenerate piece of shit smokers
00:48:15 you should all fucking die
00:48:17 for any of you
00:48:19 straight edge boys
00:48:21 straight edge brothers
00:48:23 I hate the fact that
00:48:25 I deserve to just throw my fucking cigarette butts on the ground
00:48:27 like a fucking asshole
00:48:29 I have a special license to that
00:48:31 it's okay if I live here because it's kind of small
00:48:33 I'm saying in like urban areas
00:48:35 those streets get swept
00:48:37 there are sweet streepers that sweep up detritus on the streets
00:48:39 so why not just throw it on the street
00:48:41 if I'm a vapor
00:48:43 I can just smash it on the fucking ground
00:48:45 and I can just go and walk away
00:48:47 like that's fine
00:48:49 yeah it's gonna get swept up
00:48:51 who gives a shit
00:48:53 because we're making the world worse
00:48:55 I'm not because the street sweepers are coming
00:48:57 whether I do that or not
00:48:59 but in the meantime
00:49:01 people are gonna step on these fucking butts
00:49:03 and be like ew gross
00:49:05 who the fuck would even notice
00:49:07 who
00:49:09 me every day
00:49:11 I walk and I see
00:49:13 literally littering and it's not okay
00:49:15 dirt is purely aesthetic
00:49:17 it's not even real
00:49:19 I look for people who wouldn't litter
00:49:21 I hate seeing litter all over
00:49:23 like fucking
00:49:25 just like just carry it a little bit
00:49:27 or just throw it into a bin
00:49:29 I hate litter so much
00:49:31 it's funny because
00:49:33 the reason I asked that question about the cigarette butts
00:49:35 is that I will always
00:49:37 go out of my way to throw a cigarette butt in a trash can
00:49:39 unless there isn't a trash can
00:49:41 but I am not carrying it around
00:49:43 because that shit will make my pockets stink
00:49:45 and it gives a little fucking
00:49:47 that is your problem
00:49:49 that would be my suggestion
00:49:51 I don't smoke anymore anyway
00:49:53 have a little plastic bag ready in your pocket
00:49:55 you don't smoke that particular drug
00:49:57 no I don't smoke tobacco cigarettes anymore
00:49:59 did you
00:50:01 just have a little plastic bag ready in your pocket
00:50:03 for cigarette butts
00:50:05 that's like a huge
00:50:07 ask
00:50:09 god what up
00:50:11 heaven forbid
00:50:13 I take responsibility to my own hands
00:50:15 and forge my life
00:50:17 to be this way
00:50:19 one second ago I was like
00:50:21 fuck the earth and you were all like
00:50:23 okay and now I was like
00:50:25 there's cigarette butts on the ground when I can't find a trash can
00:50:27 and everyone's like oh Hitler
00:50:29 like
00:50:31 you guys are fucking full of shit
00:50:33 I'm 100% consistent the earth has no long term significance
00:50:35 but while it's our environment
00:50:37 it matters incredibly so
00:50:39 this is our shit let's not fuck it up
00:50:41 a cigarette butt on the sidewalk
00:50:43 is not like detrimental to the earth
00:50:45 and the problem is that
00:50:47 if you say you don't vote
00:50:49 and everyone says they don't vote
00:50:51 then no one votes
00:50:53 exactly I mean that's the same yeah
00:50:55 I don't care
00:50:57 you got down to the obvious bin
00:50:59 I think they're aesthetically pleasing
00:51:01 what you gonna do now
00:51:03 I
00:51:05 I will okay okay bin
00:51:07 you are wrong but I will
00:51:09 say that I do
00:51:11 like this is a vice
00:51:13 of mine but even though
00:51:15 this is like a porn fantasy
00:51:17 this is like a degradation fantasy
00:51:19 I like dirty cities
00:51:21 they're pretty pleasing to look at
00:51:23 if I see like a city
00:51:25 a grungy looking city in a cartoon
00:51:27 or a video game
00:51:29 yeah I'll be like
00:51:31 yeah
00:51:33 if you were open like some steam coming out
00:51:35 and I slip on a puddle of dirty fucking
00:51:37 muckin' cum then I'll be like
00:51:39 yes this is what I live for
00:51:41 I like to see the smokes here inside
00:51:43 I wanna see smoke fucking fill the skies
00:51:45 I wanna be there no cloud
00:51:47 I wanna be in factories everywhere
00:51:49 here's a good rule of thumb to operate yourself by
00:51:51 in these urban environments
00:51:53 if with whatever you're doing
00:51:55 if Rorschach walked by and saw you doing
00:51:57 what you're thinking of doing
00:51:59 would he beat you to death
00:52:01 don't do it and that's exactly what
00:52:05 using Rorschach as your moral compass
00:52:07 yes
00:52:09 think about that for a second
00:52:11 yeah that's right
00:52:13 he did nothing wrong
00:52:15 okay good
00:52:17 are you talking shit on Rorschach right now
00:52:19 he's a fucking psycho dude
00:52:21 he's a fucking psycho murderer
00:52:23 it's true he was
00:52:25 he was the best guy
00:52:27 the best guy
00:52:29 another vice of mine
00:52:31 sometimes
00:52:33 I'll say I want a amusement parkification
00:52:35 I want all that by the way
00:52:37 hashtag a amusement parkification for nature
00:52:39 occasionally
00:52:41 I'll still be like
00:52:43 oh I'll read a creepy posse
00:52:45 and there'll be an evil clown man in the forest
00:52:47 and I'll be like why don't we just get rid of forest
00:52:49 why don't we just like have
00:52:51 we don't just make oxygen
00:52:53 then go to the sewers my chief
00:52:55 that's right
00:52:57 but if we just make
00:52:59 tanks of oxygen
00:53:01 and just like make them respawn a lot somehow
00:53:03 there would be no creepypasta
00:53:05 why don't we just have
00:53:07 no where to go
00:53:09 those clowns will move to the sewers
00:53:11 duh
00:53:13 now they're closer to me
00:53:15 I'm fucked up
00:53:17 we already have co2 spawners they're called trees
00:53:19 we might as well just use them
00:53:21 we need forests so we can exile freaks
00:53:23 like where are we gonna send them
00:53:25 what if we could have
00:53:27 what if we had
00:53:29 natural
00:53:31 concentration camps but they were in the forest
00:53:33 and instead of killing them we could just be like
00:53:35 okay go back to nature now
00:53:37 are you a tribe now
00:53:39 are you in reservations or something
00:53:41 oh here's a suggestion
00:53:43 install lights in the forest so it's not dark and creepy
00:53:45 that's a good idea
00:53:47 I have no problem with that
00:53:49 but look manchi we need
00:53:51 I want string lights just on all the trees in America
00:53:53 I want Christmas lights
00:53:55 to line the top of forests
00:53:57 I want Christmas lights in jungles
00:53:59 here's how we're gonna put them up
00:54:01 we're just gonna have
00:54:03 a bunch of fucking kids with string lights
00:54:05 just run around the forest
00:54:07 run between trees
00:54:09 so we can get lights on them
00:54:11 and get rid of kids at the same time
00:54:13 two problems solved at the same time
00:54:15 I like it
00:54:17 here's what we go we get the unitesates air force
00:54:19 to get a giant net full of Christmas trees
00:54:21 and just air raid forests
00:54:23 and just jump a fucking ton of lights
00:54:25 over the top of them
00:54:27 we want to utilize the native population
00:54:29 I've got a two word solution for this
00:54:31 t-shirt cannons
00:54:33 that's how we do it
00:54:35 that's how we modernize t-shirt cannons
00:54:37 that's how we're gonna get them
00:54:39 good
00:54:41 okay okay okay
00:54:43 I love nature
00:54:45 and I like it
00:54:47 there we go that was my point
00:54:49 well this podcast is winding down
00:54:51 I think
00:54:53 I wanted to tell
00:54:55 a story about trees but it's kind of
00:54:57 boring after all that discussion
00:54:59 can you compress it into two sentences
00:55:01 no
00:55:03 well I try
00:55:07 because I really
00:55:09 love nature and especially love trees
00:55:11 when I was a little kid I loved trees so much
00:55:13 that if I accidentally
00:55:15 broke a branch or took
00:55:17 some leaves from it I would out loud
00:55:19 say I'm sorry tree and I would
00:55:21 give it a hug and I would make my friends
00:55:23 do it and they would do it
00:55:25 at least around me
00:55:27 oh I feel so sad
00:55:29 whenever I step on a snail
00:55:31 oh fuck any of you
00:55:33 I once felt guilty for
00:55:35 like a week because I had
00:55:37 a snail and I
00:55:39 went on a bus and I was holding the snail
00:55:41 and it fell out of my hands and then
00:55:43 I actually raised
00:55:45 my hands as pets but that's beside the point
00:55:47 at this point in time of the story
00:55:49 it fell out of my hands
00:55:51 and some guy stepped on the snail
00:55:53 and I felt so bad because
00:55:55 like if I hadn't brought that snail with me
00:55:57 it would still be alive and I just I just cried
00:55:59 I was a little kid and I cried
00:56:01 you're often out of mage with snails I want that
00:56:03 I love snails
00:56:05 I had them as pets and like
00:56:07 I fed them a little bit of carrot and they
00:56:09 freaking loved the carrot and it was really cute
00:56:11 wait how big
00:56:13 snails you have
00:56:15 small, very small, they're garden snails basically
00:56:17 how they can eat carrots
00:56:19 well yeah they
00:56:21 normal a little bit it was adorable
00:56:23 they just a little crazy
00:56:25 did you ever race them
00:56:27 did you ever race the snails
00:56:29 race?
00:56:31 yeah race you know
00:56:33 when I was a kid yeah that's what we used to do
00:56:35 with other kids
00:56:37 we would pick our snails and we had little snail races
00:56:39 just like an undertale
00:56:41 was there a big snail
00:56:43 culture with the lady
00:56:45 and every kid
00:56:47 have their own decked out
00:56:49 personalized snail
00:56:51 you would put them in the arena
00:56:53 the snails
00:56:55 they came in very many
00:56:57 different colors and stuff so
00:56:59 my favorites were the pink ones
00:57:01 they still are
00:57:03 snails are way more diverse
00:57:05 where you come from
00:57:07 snail shells
00:57:09 oh the shells
00:57:11 okay
00:57:13 around Boston there were some really
00:57:15 sweet spiral shell snails
00:57:17 crawling around people's gardens and stuff
00:57:19 around here in Georgia all we got are slugs
00:57:21 and I hate them
00:57:23 they're really boring as well as being gross
00:57:25 they're just long and thin
00:57:27 they look like worms but they don't move
00:57:29 speaking of worms I also had worms as pets at some point
00:57:31 I really like nature
00:57:33 this is a good said way
00:57:35 this is not extremely topic
00:57:37 viewers this is a real thing I wanted you to do
00:57:39 this was it out of my note
00:57:41 I have a big thing I want to say animals
00:57:43 animals in nature
00:57:45 I love
00:57:47 about grasshoppers
00:57:49 another thing I used to do in my youth
00:57:51 I'm not sure if they're called crickets or grasshoppers
00:57:53 they were tiny the small ones
00:57:55 the small colorful ones
00:57:57 grasshoppers
00:57:59 crickets are black
00:58:01 so there used to be this
00:58:03 small field by my neighborhood
00:58:05 somewhere and it had like super
00:58:07 tall grass like Pokemon tall grass
00:58:09 and I would sometimes
00:58:11 go there during the evenings when I had nothing to do
00:58:13 during the summer and there were like
00:58:15 grasshoppers and stuff and I would capture them
00:58:17 but you know like I wouldn't like
00:58:19 capture them with both of my hands
00:58:21 what I would do I would like bend
00:58:23 lean over extend
00:58:25 my finger to the grasshopper and usually
00:58:27 it would like hop away but after like two or
00:58:29 three times the grasshopper would just climb
00:58:31 onto my finger on its own
00:58:33 and I'd be like hello little friend and then
00:58:35 I would stare at it and it just had fun with it
00:58:37 and once I'm done I would like
00:58:39 let it hop away and that was fun
00:58:41 fucking rip off its limbs one by one
00:58:43 yeah
00:58:45 so you feel powerful for what's in your life
00:58:47 I was
00:58:49 I once felt like a grasshopper that was like
00:58:51 black and red and was fucking energy and I
00:58:53 loved it and I needed it
00:58:55 sadly later on I learned that
00:58:57 they only lived through in the summer and I was really
00:58:59 sad the next year I was like I miss my friend
00:59:01 I wish I had
00:59:03 a fucking edgy grasshopper
00:59:05 I wish I had like an edgy buggy that was my companion
00:59:07 I would take him on adventures that's
00:59:09 you lived far more than I have
00:59:11 there isn't that is there that's too bad
00:59:13 there should be an edgy bug in pokemon
00:59:15 uh saizor
00:59:17 that's kind of edgy not edgy enough though
00:59:19 he's a good um
00:59:21 I love edgy things edgy things are the only thing I
00:59:23 fucking live for that's why I like the trolls
00:59:25 and homesick so they're fucking edgy and stupid
00:59:27 and they're violent and I like it
00:59:29 people steal bugs
00:59:31 ok hold on pokemon not real
00:59:33 here's what are real animals
00:59:35 I take edgy I take
00:59:37 umbraze with your hatred of animals animals
00:59:39 are fucking great they are incredible
00:59:41 they are a net positive 100% time
00:59:43 bugs don't count cause fuck bugs but
00:59:45 but big animals real big
00:59:47 mammals and fish and shit I fucking
00:59:49 love you know why
00:59:51 because they're always terrifying
00:59:53 there is not a single animal
00:59:55 that does not make me shit myself
00:59:57 I walked around and said I see you all fucking
00:59:59 dead I was gonna say you can see a bear
01:00:01 slightly less scared but still extremely
01:00:03 scared animals are fucking
01:00:05 a beast of the land they are beast
01:00:07 and they are terrifying and the
01:00:09 and animals come like like animals
01:00:11 are like humans are
01:00:13 animals we come from this land of
01:00:15 beasts and disgusting awful
01:00:17 scary like like cthulhu
01:00:19 type monsters that are snails
01:00:21 and dogs we come
01:00:23 from that barbaric age and we have
01:00:25 conquered we animals have
01:00:27 conquered and we come civilized
01:00:29 and cultured and incredible and now
01:00:31 we now we control the
01:00:33 beast of the land now we control the
01:00:35 the weird awful
01:00:37 archaic beast
01:00:39 of the land and we are the masters of society
01:00:41 we have done it we have conquered
01:00:43 animals and that's what the beast of the land is
01:00:45 whenever I walk out and see a snail I think wow we have done it
01:00:47 humans have gone so far we've
01:00:49 escaped the clutches of nature and we have done
01:00:51 it I hate animals
01:00:53 we uh you know it's fair to
01:00:55 it's fair to remember it's fair to remember
01:00:57 that uh we have no
01:00:59 formalized contract people don't like animals
01:01:01 so animals are great
01:01:03 we have no contract with the animals and we
01:01:05 can take them or leave them
01:01:07 oh my god shut the fuck up everyone
01:01:11 big memberless are good but
01:01:13 shut up you need to get closer to your microphone
01:01:15 you're not like quite overpoweringly
01:01:17 loud am I am I
01:01:19 am I cursing the microphone now
01:01:21 can you hear what I'm saying right now
01:01:23 stop stop stop
01:01:25 we have made no accord with the beast of the
01:01:27 field and so it's easy to just forget
01:01:29 that they could just murder us at any time
01:01:31 they do not respect us like because we are on
01:01:33 dogs so much dogs have been bred to be like
01:01:35 weak cowards but like uh you know
01:01:37 not the fucking a pigeon
01:01:39 pigeon could just fucking claw your eyes out one
01:01:41 actually it doesn't give a shit
01:01:43 Nate it's interesting you mentioned dogs because I was
01:01:45 reading about dogs and apparently there's like the
01:01:47 reason we were able to domesticate dogs is
01:01:49 like uh like mental condition
01:01:51 or like genetic disposition
01:01:53 neoteny that makes you like be friends
01:01:55 with everybody and like people can get that too
01:01:57 but like that's the thing we bred
01:01:59 in dogs that's why dogs are so friendlies
01:02:01 because we gave them all like mental condition
01:02:03 what I heard was that we continually
01:02:05 bred like so neoteny
01:02:07 is the trait that is like when you display
01:02:09 like baby like traits and so like
01:02:11 dogs propensity for like cuddling
01:02:13 and just like being friends with everybody
01:02:15 very much comes from when they're babies
01:02:17 and they just like don't know any better and so
01:02:19 like with with dog breeding we just continually
01:02:21 bred like the friendliest of the friendliest
01:02:23 dogs to like just make them the most
01:02:25 you know you know domesticated and so they just
01:02:27 did that forever and now just like all the dogs
01:02:29 all the you know domestic dogs just like
01:02:31 great it is like
01:02:33 dogs I don't like the only
01:02:35 dog I've had excellent prolonged experience
01:02:37 with was one of my
01:02:39 ex-girlfriend's dogs that just shit on the floor
01:02:41 constantly and I wanted to kill it
01:02:43 well that's the word that's not
01:02:45 it's your owners
01:02:47 before we go
01:02:49 out of dog hole I just want to say
01:02:51 I'm going down the dog hole
01:02:53 if you plan for pigeons
01:02:55 is hepto-bismol I think
01:02:57 doesn't that make their stomachs explode
01:02:59 I had pigeons
01:03:01 please do not talk about this
01:03:03 how do you get the pepto-bismol in their stomachs though
01:03:05 I've heard that when people throw rice at weddings
01:03:07 that birds eat the rice
01:03:09 when their stomach can kill them
01:03:11 I'm thinking of seagulls that if you give them pepto-bismol
01:03:13 they'll like explode
01:03:15 I still don't know how you get it
01:03:17 rats are like that like if rats drink soda it can kill them
01:03:19 because they can't burp
01:03:21 no animal cruelty please no
01:03:23 no one's actually doing this
01:03:25 these are just contingencies for if a pigeon comes
01:03:27 at my fucking eyes like Nate was saying
01:03:29 I have ways to be a pigeon
01:03:31 if a pigeon ever puts me in a self-defense
01:03:33 situation you know
01:03:35 I will defend myself
01:03:37 I will legally defend myself
01:03:39 I'm not saying that
01:03:41 like animals are pacified
01:03:43 that's what I like about animals is that they're not pacified
01:03:45 and they're fucking dangerous and violent
01:03:47 but we as humans have the tools
01:03:49 and knowledge to like
01:03:51 if a pigeon just like I was just walking down the street
01:03:53 a pigeon could like get a claw in
01:03:55 but I have a big fist
01:03:57 and also I could have a gun if I wanted to
01:03:59 I could carry like a spear or something
01:04:01 the problem is that we let our defenses down
01:04:03 and they could theoretically clawed an eye
01:04:05 our stupid good boys they would not hurt you
01:04:07 okay maybe like a hawk
01:04:09 I'm sure they wouldn't
01:04:11 I'm just saying animals are dangerous
01:04:13 and again they are beasts
01:04:15 that's what I like about animals is that they are beasts
01:04:17 they're modern monsters
01:04:19 contingency plan number two
01:04:21 you gotta hawk
01:04:23 get a glock
01:04:25 you know what I'm saying
01:04:27 okay guys
01:04:29 listen like animals aren't
01:04:31 unpredictable forces of nature or anything
01:04:33 they usually give signs of their aggressive
01:04:35 or they're gonna attack or something
01:04:37 just like a boss
01:04:39 in Dark Souls
01:04:41 so you're not gonna
01:04:43 get surprised by an animal
01:04:45 you just have to watch for signs
01:04:47 my biggest criticisms of animals
01:04:49 is that they have too long of wind ups
01:04:51 before their attacks
01:04:53 it makes fighting them boring and uninteresting
01:04:55 it's not good
01:04:57 they need to work on that
01:04:59 I'm not saying the animals will attack me
01:05:01 I'm just saying that we have the power to do that
01:05:03 and that makes me feel
01:05:05 more confident
01:05:07 touching animals
01:05:09 I know that I could kill them if I wanted to
01:05:11 I don't want to
01:05:13 real question
01:05:15 real question
01:05:17 if you were attacked by a vicious
01:05:19 do you think you could beat it
01:05:21 do you think you'd live
01:05:23 I think it would be really hard
01:05:25 I think it would be really hard
01:05:27 but when humans
01:05:29 if you're a cornered human
01:05:31 you can kill most things
01:05:33 they have that badge and paper Mario
01:05:35 where if you get below 5 health
01:05:37 your attack expands
01:05:39 that's what all humans have intrinsically
01:05:41 you can do crazy shit when you're about to die
01:05:43 I've often wondered if a pitbull
01:05:45 bit me on the arm or something
01:05:47 all I could do is try to punch it in the eye
01:05:49 or maybe gouge out its eyes or something
01:05:51 I wonder how effective that would be
01:05:53 I feel like if the dog was even a bit smaller
01:05:55 than you that you could probably beat it
01:05:57 unless it got the drop on you
01:05:59 and tore your throat out or something
01:06:01 it still supports behind me
01:06:03 I feel like they're all under
01:06:05 underestimating the dog
01:06:07 I feel like there's a chance
01:06:09 it's gonna just fucking take your arm off
01:06:11 if it bites your arm
01:06:13 but I also feel like if you punch it in the face
01:06:15 enough times you could knock it out
01:06:17 that's the question
01:06:19 you'll probably lose that arm though
01:06:21 I definitely think the bigger
01:06:23 dog gets obviously the less your chances are
01:06:25 but like a pitbull, it's dangerous
01:06:27 I think we'll both be at low HP
01:06:29 by the end of it
01:06:31 but I think any human could overrun
01:06:33 unless like a baby
01:06:35 there was a pitbull that started attacking kids
01:06:37 in my old neighborhood
01:06:39 cause they're kids
01:06:41 wait, the story's not over yet
01:06:43 and it became
01:06:45 like this legend among the cops
01:06:47 the cops had to come out and fucking
01:06:49 put it down
01:06:51 and they shot at the dog
01:06:53 and the bullets bounced off its skull
01:06:55 what the fuck
01:06:57 yeah dude
01:06:59 should they take it down or what
01:07:01 they eventually got, but you shoot at other places
01:07:03 it's not as like
01:07:05 they had to call in fucking cloud strife to do omnislash
01:07:07 dude, what the fuck
01:07:09 unbelievable
01:07:11 yeah, it was fucking insane dude
01:07:13 dude, someone edit please
01:07:15 like this dog as Sephiroth
01:07:17 in the confrontation between cloud and Sephiroth
01:07:19 at the end of this
01:07:21 also while you're at that edit
01:07:23 just like find a gallery of guys
01:07:25 that have been mauled by bears
01:07:27 and just edit all their photos to have the phrase
01:07:29 shoulda rolled on them
01:07:31 shoulda rolled man
01:07:33 shoulda rolled
01:07:35 I agree with you Tom
01:07:37 but I think that's like all skulls
01:07:39 like humans can like survive headshots to the face
01:07:41 like under weird precarious conditions
01:07:43 they don't bounce off though
01:07:45 bullets are specifically designed
01:07:47 to blow up your skull
01:07:49 that's like why they were made
01:07:51 no, I'm just saying like under extremely low
01:07:53 like there have been people who are survived headshots
01:07:55 because of the specific weird way that it happened
01:07:57 people will like
01:07:59 what happened to the people could happen to a human
01:08:01 if people kill themselves they generally shoot
01:08:03 inside the mouth up so that they
01:08:05 really fuck themselves up
01:08:07 what is the temple?
01:08:09 yeah, that's right
01:08:11 I've thought a lot about this
01:08:13 whether it's best to go with the inside the mouth
01:08:15 or the temple approach
01:08:17 what's gonna be grosser though
01:08:19 cause I wanna be as least gross as possible
01:08:21 I've actually considered the whole shooting yourself in the heart though
01:08:23 then don't use the gun
01:08:25 I don't want to shoot myself in the heart
01:08:27 cause I'll probably feel it
01:08:29 I don't want to feel it
01:08:31 you brain yourself
01:08:33 I'm pretty sure you'd
01:08:35 man, I think about what it would feel like to get shot in the head all the time
01:08:37 oh me too, I was doing that yesterday a bunch
01:08:39 cause I was hurting from being sick
01:08:41 all the time
01:08:43 I'm pretty sure there would be a moment there
01:08:45 where you would feel it happening
01:08:47 and it'd be like oh my god dude
01:08:49 I was really thinking about this
01:08:51 time is like slowed down
01:08:53 and you feel each individual piece
01:08:55 of the shotgun blast
01:08:57 invading your brain from inside your mouth
01:08:59 and you feel like up to your skull
01:09:01 I think about what does it feel like
01:09:03 to have one's brain violently
01:09:05 destroyed all the time
01:09:07 what the fuck is happening
01:09:09 this is what nature leads to
01:09:11 too much nature leads to this kind of suicide
01:09:15 overexposed your suicide
01:09:17 if you hang out around trees enough
01:09:19 you're going to start thinking about
01:09:21 which one will hold the best
01:09:23 rope the best
01:09:25 that's why people kill themselves
01:09:27 in alki gahara
01:09:29 and in greenland
01:09:31 they're always stuck at the trees
01:09:33 everyone in greenland
01:09:35 spends too much time in nature and not enough of civilization
01:09:37 so they have the highest suicide rate in the fucking world
01:09:39 last time I checked
01:09:41 we need urban sprawl
01:09:43 we need hip hop
01:09:45 that's the most civilization you can get
01:09:47 on the civilization scale hip hop is
01:09:49 what a hundred percent
01:09:51 hip hop is actually a peak civilization
01:09:53 clearly
01:09:55 that's true
01:09:57 I was hoping that you would be like
01:09:59 explain why he doesn't like animals
01:10:01 but I guess
01:10:03 oh do you want that?
01:10:05 unless you asked while I was on the tour
01:10:07 I went to pee for a while
01:10:09 no he did
01:10:11 anyway
01:10:13 I don't like animals because
01:10:15 they're annoying
01:10:17 they can't talk
01:10:19 they're fucking boring
01:10:21 they can't be negotiated with
01:10:23 everything I value about humans
01:10:25 is the ability to have conversations with them
01:10:27 that is the main thing
01:10:29 that other humans can give me
01:10:31 other than physical contact
01:10:33 and I don't think I would want physical contact with a person
01:10:35 that I could not
01:10:37 communicate with
01:10:39 it doesn't have to necessarily be verbally
01:10:41 text form but if I can't communicate
01:10:43 with somebody I'm not going to want to
01:10:45 hang out with them and
01:10:47 touch them or anything
01:10:49 animals just want
01:10:51 things and they have no sense
01:10:53 of moral obligation
01:10:55 towards you
01:10:57 my cat
01:10:59 when I lived back at home we had a cat
01:11:01 then you lived in the same house as this cat
01:11:03 she fucking
01:11:05 at any time of night if she wants
01:11:07 something she will come make you do it
01:11:09 she will pick you up
01:11:11 she will meow at your door all night
01:11:13 until you wake up and come do something for her
01:11:15 because she doesn't care about you
01:11:17 she can't comprehend your needs
01:11:19 she can't make compromises
01:11:21 because she cannot fathom
01:11:23 yeah
01:11:25 what about that
01:11:27 why should you sign up
01:11:29 why should you sign up for a relationship
01:11:31 that is completely one sided
01:11:33 that you are expected to provide for this other animal
01:11:35 and this other animal is not expected to do anything
01:11:37 I get that you might like what they do
01:11:39 it just irks me that
01:11:41 what they're doing is just what they want to do
01:11:43 and if that happens to please you
01:11:45 then so it goes
01:11:47 but they're not doing anything for your sake
01:11:49 you're providing for all of their needs
01:11:51 that legendary dog
01:11:53 who came to visit his master in Japan
01:11:55 every fucking day even after he died
01:11:57 Hachiko
01:11:59 the most legendary dog who ever lived
01:12:01 I visited his statue
01:12:03 he's a fucking god
01:12:05 but he just wanted his master
01:12:07 that's like saying obeying
01:12:09 well okay
01:12:11 you seem to be putting like thought
01:12:13 and like responsibility over
01:12:15 just like natural inclination
01:12:17 like that makes it more moral
01:12:19 like you are more valuable
01:12:21 I'm saying that I can see why that's like good
01:12:23 like if a dog is naturally inclined to love you
01:12:25 and you want love
01:12:27 I get why that's appealing
01:12:29 it just bugs me that there's no
01:12:31 it just bugs me that the relationship is so one sided
01:12:33 but I would argue that every human
01:12:35 only does what it wants to do
01:12:37 yeah
01:12:39 but we can guilt humans
01:12:41 that's true
01:12:43 I think you guys are thinking about this all wrong
01:12:45 animals are not humans
01:12:47 they're not mint
01:12:49 their function is not to have ideas
01:12:51 their function is to be
01:12:53 aesthetic and provide
01:12:55 sometimes practical benefit to humans
01:12:57 like oxes or
01:12:59 dogs or some stuff
01:13:01 aesthetic and provide
01:13:03 like practical application
01:13:05 with a dog you can train to fucking kill things
01:13:07 you know if we're back in
01:13:09 early times you can train to kill things
01:13:11 that's a practical benefit of it
01:13:13 but the main thing for me is aesthetic
01:13:15 I just like seeing again beasts
01:13:17 I like seeing dangerous monsters
01:13:19 roam about and do their living
01:13:21 it's terrifying
01:13:23 and it fills me with like a
01:13:25 gladiator lust for either
01:13:27 killing it or making it kill things for me
01:13:29 that's what I want from my animals
01:13:31 I agree that
01:13:33 animals are not like
01:13:35 they're not conversationalist
01:13:37 but that's not what I meant to do
01:13:39 I don't classify them as humans
01:13:41 I understand the appeal of animals
01:13:43 I get why other people like animals
01:13:45 it's just that nothing they have to offer
01:13:47 really does anything for me
01:13:49 because all I like to do is
01:13:51 smoke weed and have long conversations
01:13:53 and make videos and fuck
01:13:55 and animals can't do any of those things
01:13:57 well the last one
01:13:59 you can't
01:14:01 not legally
01:14:03 in most states
01:14:05 I should say
01:14:07 they just can't consent is all
01:14:09 did we want to talk more about nature
01:14:11 do we want to move into questions
01:14:13 because I got some questions pulled aside
01:14:15 I'm feeling pretty good
01:14:17 anyone want to make any closing statements here
01:14:19 anyone got any final words
01:14:21 hash out your reason for parkification
01:14:23 sorry to say that again
01:14:25 never mind it's fine
01:14:27 no one say anything ever again
01:14:29 mozilla fennekin asks
01:14:31 now hang on did you
01:14:33 is this coming from the legendary patron lounge
01:14:35 oh my god
01:14:37 if you patron anything to the pcp
01:14:39 one dollar
01:14:41 one dollar you get patron lounge
01:14:43 and that's where we get all our fucking questions from
01:14:45 because
01:14:47 it's easy and cool
01:14:49 mozilla fennekin
01:14:51 asked what's the most you're willing to spend
01:14:53 on a single meal
01:14:55 20 dollars
01:14:57 20 dollars
01:14:59 unless it's like an occasion
01:15:01 if it's like a festivity or a holiday
01:15:03 then it'll probably be like 50 or 60
01:15:05 if I want to flip
01:15:07 is that for just you
01:15:09 or are you paying for somebody else
01:15:11 that's what I was going to ask
01:15:13 you're right
01:15:15 usually what I am flipping it is
01:15:17 what's the most you're willing to spend
01:15:19 on a meal
01:15:21 for yourself and for a group
01:15:23 if I was like treating a party
01:15:25 and it was like a special occasion
01:15:27 I would probably spring
01:15:29 for like up to maybe like 100 to
01:15:31 150 dollars
01:15:33 if it was like a real big
01:15:35 an event
01:15:37 if it was just for me
01:15:39 I would only pay more than like
01:15:41 15 dollars and that's high
01:15:43 I would like to pay 5 dollars
01:15:45 for a meal for myself at any given time
01:15:47 but if I was out and being
01:15:49 socially pressured and everyone else was doing it
01:15:51 I might be convinced to spend maybe up to like
01:15:53 20
01:15:55 the absolute most I could spend for myself
01:15:57 is 20 dollars
01:15:59 I would go 20 dollars
01:16:01 the absolute max I want to stay around 5
01:16:03 ideally
01:16:05 only social pressure can compel me
01:16:07 if I was going to like
01:16:09 spend money like for me
01:16:11 and like a significant other or something
01:16:13 I have spent like 150 dollars
01:16:15 before but I was not aware that it was
01:16:17 going to happen and I was very disgusted by it
01:16:19 and I made a point to say this is never happening
01:16:21 again
01:16:23 I think
01:16:25 again if it's an occasion
01:16:27 if it's like Christmas
01:16:29 but I'm the only person left alive
01:16:31 because they all were too weak to
01:16:33 see me through
01:16:35 then I could probably go like
01:16:37 50 dollars
01:16:39 if I really wanted to make a big deal
01:16:41 All right, Mage, what's your answer for this?
01:16:43 It's basically the same
01:16:45 It's the same as you guys
01:16:47 Did you, you're the only one
01:16:49 besides maybe Nate who makes a significant amount of money
01:16:51 so you're about to be like I'm going to go like
01:16:53 four figures deep on this shit
01:16:55 It's not just about how much I make
01:16:57 but that I regularly spend money
01:16:59 on food like that's where a lot of
01:17:01 you know the money I do spend goes
01:17:03 but I want to know because I know
01:17:05 Nate's thrown down pretty fucking hard
01:17:07 on some meals because he and I
01:17:09 went to a restaurant where I spent
01:17:11 like 75 dollars and you spent
01:17:13 something close to that
01:17:15 You know what I found
01:17:17 I definitely, there have been times
01:17:19 more recently when I'll go to
01:17:21 a really nice restaurant that I've like never done in my life
01:17:23 for like a year ago
01:17:25 and those are pretty expensive sometimes
01:17:27 that's pretty rare but what I've really found
01:17:29 is just that my like sort of
01:17:31 base level amount I'm willing to pay for
01:17:33 a meal has just gone way up
01:17:35 and like I just don't really care anymore
01:17:37 For me it's kind of just like
01:17:39 what do I want to eat
01:17:41 you know like if I
01:17:43 if I want to have a fancy dinner
01:17:45 with my girlfriend
01:17:47 or my fiance you know we're just going to
01:17:49 go out and
01:17:51 like it's going to be whatever it cost
01:17:53 like for Valentine's Day we went out to
01:17:55 a place next to my house
01:17:57 $150 total it was great
01:17:59 I fucking went to Burger King for Valentine's
01:18:01 and I'm happy
01:18:03 Oh you make me laugh
01:18:05 I tell you like when you
01:18:07 when you actually do
01:18:09 I mean like I'm
01:18:11 very much a stickler
01:18:13 I always have been like I used to be real cheap
01:18:15 about going out to eat and that's why I like
01:18:17 exclusively ate fast food for a real long time
01:18:19 and then
01:18:21 basically it's just
01:18:23 if you can afford it and you're willing
01:18:25 to spend the money it's like
01:18:27 food does kind of follow
01:18:29 like a rule of the more you pay
01:18:31 the better it tastes
01:18:33 it's fairly straightforward most of the time
01:18:35 like that meal I had
01:18:37 that was $150 like
01:18:39 granted in terms of portions
01:18:41 and everything no it was not at all worth it
01:18:43 like if you're talking about how much
01:18:45 is it worth to get full tonight
01:18:47 not worth it but the food was like
01:18:49 I literally had never tasted something
01:18:51 that tasted the way it tasted you know
01:18:53 and like for me it's just that sheer
01:18:55 uniqueness of experience makes it worth
01:18:57 having paid for at least once
01:18:59 you know obviously I'm not going to go spend
01:19:01 $150 on food every night but
01:19:03 you know it's nice to get to experience
01:19:05 like this flavor
01:19:07 palette that can't really be explored
01:19:09 by anyone less than a talented chef
01:19:11 you know sure well yeah
01:19:13 when I went to Jack Ruby's
01:19:15 steakhouse or whatever the precinct is like
01:19:17 the best restaurant in Cincinnati
01:19:19 like I never imagined a steak could taste
01:19:21 as good as what they made there and they
01:19:23 fucking did it they did I didn't even know that was a real
01:19:25 thing but anyway sorry time I'm
01:19:27 I'm just I don't know paying for
01:19:29 food is something that I try not to
01:19:31 do ever and just
01:19:33 I mean I like food but like the
01:19:35 experience of eating food is ephemeral
01:19:37 you know it's fleeting and
01:19:39 like once you've done it it's over and so like
01:19:41 the fact that I invested money in it and now
01:19:43 the money is gone and the experience
01:19:45 was never going to last anyway there's a lot
01:19:47 of studies that state that say that people
01:19:49 ultimately find themselves more happy
01:19:51 with purchases they made
01:19:53 for experiences rather than possessions
01:19:55 because when you have a possession around
01:19:57 you'll constantly look at it and
01:19:59 judge it again like I hate
01:20:01 most of the crap I own in my room
01:20:03 like all the shit in my back
01:20:05 drops for all my videos and shit because a lot
01:20:07 of this is just DVDs that I'll look at and I'll be
01:20:09 like I spent like a hundred dollars on that box
01:20:11 set and A I've never watched
01:20:13 it and B like you know I don't even
01:20:15 really like the show that much anymore because
01:20:17 like you know it just sits around reminding
01:20:19 me of how much money I spent on it and how
01:20:21 if I had that money back I could be doing
01:20:23 something different right now but if you just
01:20:25 go say to again a fancy
01:20:27 restaurant you have a great time all you'll
01:20:29 remember about that for the rest of your life
01:20:31 is I went to a fancy restaurant I had a great
01:20:33 time you know like I'll never forget
01:20:35 me and Nate go into that restaurant because I'd never
01:20:37 been to any place like that before and like
01:20:39 we were fucking getting weighted on by
01:20:41 like like wind and dine the guy
01:20:43 coming up pouring our fucking water for us
01:20:45 and shit and we're like yeah you know
01:20:47 it was sick
01:20:49 how dope was that scared Italian
01:20:51 at anime expo did you need
01:20:53 how dope was that scared Italian who would
01:20:55 like give us orange oh that guy
01:20:57 it was amazing it was the best
01:20:59 he was incredible he was my favorite person
01:21:01 I like nice food I just
01:21:03 I just wish I could afford it more often
01:21:05 well most of what just quickly though
01:21:07 the burger king has like really awesome
01:21:09 milkshakes the one that's
01:21:11 sure so it was not a bad deal
01:21:13 I quite like it and we got like
01:21:15 because we had to wait a little bit we got
01:21:17 like big milkshakes so
01:21:19 nice most of what I actually eat
01:21:21 is cans of dark red
01:21:23 kidney beans like boxes of salad
01:21:25 protein powder and then
01:21:27 like chicken breast and broccoli salad
01:21:29 yeah they've got these like plastic
01:21:31 containers of salad at the Kroger
01:21:33 I'll just go buy that it's got a big fucking
01:21:35 thing of spinach I'll just like munch on that for two days
01:21:37 it's great enough about your diet
01:21:39 wait what munch
01:21:41 is it important what yes
01:21:43 yes it is important
01:21:45 I want to talk
01:21:47 about food more because I love food
01:21:49 I've been Ben you
01:21:51 said that the experience of eating food is fleeting
01:21:53 and I agree and this is why I hate sex
01:21:55 but food is different than sex
01:21:57 because food you can
01:21:59 have it like you can like
01:22:01 go out to a restaurant you can have it with other people
01:22:03 and we'll be that's we can have do the sex
01:22:05 nevermind I'm saying that restaurants are good
01:22:07 and I like going to restaurants I like people to talk to
01:22:09 eating food and talking
01:22:11 to people and the experience of being out of your house
01:22:13 out in the world
01:22:15 eating at a restaurant perhaps the restaurants you've
01:22:17 never been to before at a new restaurant with your friends
01:22:19 talking about the day you've had
01:22:21 experiences you're going to have
01:22:23 that is far better than ever sex you could
01:22:25 ever have
01:22:27 take that you pop into that 7-Eleven
01:22:29 and grab your food and then you take it
01:22:31 out into nature
01:22:33 and eat it in the fridge
01:22:35 that's how you fucking have it
01:22:37 that's a good idea I think you're going to say take your 7-Eleven
01:22:39 go to a fancy restaurant
01:22:43 guys picnics are such a cute idea
01:22:45 I would lie
01:22:47 you know there's like a big yard
01:22:49 right on there we should have a picnic
01:22:51 that's a good idea
01:22:53 can we have a picnic at radcon 4
01:22:55 whenever I come over
01:22:57 probably maybe you can't promise
01:22:59 off topic can we do radcon 4
01:23:01 in england
01:23:03 main shows up to radcon 4 and she's like
01:23:05 so can we do another picnic like you guys did at the last one
01:23:07 I'm like no
01:23:09 that idea is past
01:23:11 yeah the moment's past it's over
01:23:13 we're all about
01:23:15 we're all about
01:23:17 eating soilent now
01:23:19 by the way
01:23:21 radcon 3 arena
01:23:23 is confirmed everybody
01:23:25 the kickstarter is now over
01:23:27 and not only is it confirmed
01:23:29 but the first kickstarter tier is already
01:23:31 fulfilled it's unlikely at this point
01:23:33 we'll have gotten the second but maybe it will
01:23:35 who knows man
01:23:37 wait there's two
01:23:39 it ends in like 4 days from today
01:23:41 on the 21st I think
01:23:43 I thought there was still a lot of time left
01:23:45 well whatever anyway
01:23:47 I mean my kickstarter
01:23:49 spiked like crazy in the last couple days
01:23:51 next question is from drybones
01:23:53 drybones this is one of my favorite questions
01:23:55 we've ever gotten on the show by the way
01:23:57 would you consider yourself
01:23:59 above your dad
01:24:01 could you defeat him physically
01:24:03 or intellectually
01:24:05 not physically intellectually yes
01:24:07 my dad's very strong
01:24:09 very very
01:24:11 very hard no
01:24:13 I know my dad and I does not make it okay
01:24:15 that doesn't make his crimes
01:24:17 any less potent
01:24:19 my dad
01:24:21 it is an old geezer
01:24:23 but he's so fucking
01:24:25 strong here's what he does
01:24:27 he hikes with rocks in his backpack
01:24:29 and every month he adds a new
01:24:31 rock to his backpack
01:24:33 he's been doing this for years
01:24:35 is he a fucking martial arts training
01:24:37 or something like that
01:24:39 he has like 30 rocks
01:24:41 in his fucking bag
01:24:43 do you talk to show training shit or something
01:24:45 it's fucking crazy he's insane
01:24:47 well that's awesome
01:24:49 he's powerful but he's also a fucking idiot
01:24:51 I can see where you got your power from now
01:24:53 yeah thank you
01:24:55 I feel like this question has a bit more nuance
01:24:57 in my situation because
01:24:59 I'm his daughter
01:25:01 what father want to punch his daughter
01:25:03 you know
01:25:05 as opposed to the father just want to punch
01:25:07 your son
01:25:09 hit him physically because he won't hit you
01:25:11 is that what you're trying to say
01:25:13 the thing is I don't want to hit him either
01:25:15 so I don't know
01:25:17 but you have to mate he's coming at you with a gun
01:25:19 what are you gonna do
01:25:21 it doesn't say anything about having to fight them
01:25:23 it just says can you defeat him physically or intellectually
01:25:25 okay physically
01:25:27 most likely no
01:25:29 no I wouldn't even though I'm taller than him
01:25:31 no I'm not I'm a squish boy
01:25:33 intellectually
01:25:35 probably
01:25:37 he's quite close minded
01:25:39 he's very averse to new ideas and stuff
01:25:41 so probably I could
01:25:43 against new age you know beliefs
01:25:45 don't let yourself be just one box
01:25:47 I feel like everyone's gonna do that about their parents
01:25:49 because that's essentially what I was gonna say about my dad
01:25:51 it's been probably as well
01:25:53 my dad is a very smart man
01:25:55 where are we so weak
01:25:57 you could definitely beat your dad physically right
01:25:59 at this point yes not for a long time though
01:26:01 not for a long time
01:26:03 everyone's kind of scared of their dads I think including me
01:26:05 to some degree
01:26:07 our dad is fires storms
01:26:09 our dad is a fucking
01:26:11 intellectual fortress if nothing else
01:26:13 that's for sure
01:26:15 well let me tell you why you've all played yourself
01:26:17 on this because the question says
01:26:19 could you defeat him physically
01:26:21 now if I have to fight my dad
01:26:23 one on one hand to hand
01:26:25 no I can't beat him that nigger roads marathons
01:26:27 and bench presses more than
01:26:29 my body weight and I can't
01:26:31 bench press more than my body well maybe
01:26:33 I don't know how much it's like an impressive amount
01:26:35 to be able to bench press
01:26:37 but anyways he's a strong man
01:26:39 however could I defeat him
01:26:41 physically I'm good at setting up traps
01:26:43 you know
01:26:45 you're gonna home alone is that
01:26:47 I'm good at using weapons
01:26:49 I'm good at fucking tricks
01:26:51 version of the quest
01:26:53 me and my brother Victor used to fight
01:26:55 in the backyard all the time
01:26:57 well you ran your marathons I practice with the block chain
01:26:59 well you lived your way
01:27:01 yeah exactly
01:27:03 when you worked on feeble aesthetics
01:27:05 well you paid as a house eye vlog
01:27:07 exactly so
01:27:09 me and Victor used to fight in the backyard all the time
01:27:11 and Victor would be stronger than me
01:27:13 but I would just like grab shit on the ground
01:27:15 and throw it at him and then jump on him
01:27:17 you know so I can do that to
01:27:19 my dad because he fights
01:27:21 so you fight dirty
01:27:23 yeah exactly and Victor
01:27:25 my dad probably won't fight nearly as dirty
01:27:27 as I will or at least not as
01:27:29 he won't think of the environment
01:27:31 as much as I will I got the Jackie Chan thing going on
01:27:33 you know like I'll throw
01:27:35 the TV at him or something
01:27:37 so
01:27:39 I do think I could defeat him physically
01:27:41 if we if I had to
01:27:43 like if it was not just oh we're like having
01:27:45 a blood feud like we're
01:27:47 passionately fighting to father and son
01:27:49 you know if we're like if my dad's a zombie
01:27:51 and I got to kill him like I can kill him
01:27:53 you know if you have
01:27:55 prep time you can kill your dad with prep time
01:27:57 let's say he's like under
01:27:59 let's say he's gone evil he's gone rogue
01:28:01 and he's murdering everybody
01:28:03 let's say he's become king deity
01:28:05 I will say that in order for me to
01:28:07 find the inner strength to kill my dad
01:28:09 he might have to strangle shade first
01:28:11 like I might need that motive
01:28:13 you know but if
01:28:15 you know if someone's been strangled
01:28:17 then I can probably get him
01:28:19 intellectually my dad
01:28:21 my dad's a smart guy but he would probably
01:28:23 forfeit to be intellectually TVH
01:28:25 because he thinks I'm a fucking genius
01:28:27 so fair enough
01:28:29 my dad would destroy me both physically
01:28:31 and intellectually
01:28:33 and emotionally
01:28:35 I've already done that to myself let's be real
01:28:37 no he's like
01:28:39 Tommy sound like you were on the verge of tears
01:28:41 when saying that
01:28:43 you sound like you were about to cry
01:28:45 that was not intentional but maybe that says something
01:28:47 deep about myself that I'm not aware of
01:28:49 it's very possible
01:28:51 but no he's like he's like
01:28:53 yes absolutely
01:28:55 no my dad's like super built
01:28:57 he's like the chief financial officer
01:28:59 for Hanscom Air Force Base he manages
01:29:01 multi-million dollar budgets on the daily
01:29:03 so yeah
01:29:05 smart guy
01:29:07 strong guy
01:29:09 does he even vlog?
01:29:11 if only
01:29:13 he had a debuff like that
01:29:15 I might stand a chance but no
01:29:17 he hasn't been distracted
01:29:19 by the
01:29:21 feudal pursuits like we all have
01:29:23 so indeed
01:29:25 alright here's our next question
01:29:27 from horse power
01:29:29 I'll next one
01:29:31 it says
01:29:33 how do you know if you're chasing a dream
01:29:35 or a dilution
01:29:37 oh that's got to be somebody made a video called
01:29:39 that recently who was that
01:29:41 it was Fantano
01:29:43 he probably said delusion
01:29:45 not dilution
01:29:47 that's true
01:29:49 I would expect so
01:29:53 I don't know if there is a way to
01:29:55 I mean
01:29:57 how do you qualify
01:29:59 when do you say it's a delusion
01:30:01 like if you're making money off of it does that mean it's not a delusion
01:30:03 but like what if it falls away
01:30:05 one day is it a delusion
01:30:07 I think a delusion is inherently only decided
01:30:09 after the fact I don't know if you can
01:30:11 you have to try
01:30:13 before you'll know
01:30:15 as soon as you know it's a delusion
01:30:17 that's what constitutes a delusion
01:30:19 let's talk about the exact example that he brought up
01:30:21 it's this guy, he didn't say his name but everyone was quite
01:30:23 it was quite clear who he was talking about
01:30:25 this guy Uncle Adams
01:30:27 he's made a bunch of cringy music videos and songs in the past
01:30:29 and he is now
01:30:31 like he's
01:30:33 he talked about how he's already sold his house
01:30:35 he sold his car, he's making these vlogs or whatever
01:30:37 he is like $200,000
01:30:39 and dead at this point
01:30:41 and he's decided he is not stopping until he has
01:30:43 a big music career
01:30:45 like here's what I don't understand
01:30:47 about that, it's like somebody like me
01:30:49 was able to just do youtube
01:30:51 while having a job and not completely
01:30:53 burying myself in debt
01:30:55 I think that is the smart path to take
01:30:57 to put all your eggs in one basket
01:30:59 like that seems like a mistake in my opinion
01:31:01 and like to be fair
01:31:03 I think you just need to know if it's a sure thing
01:31:05 I mean I can see putting all your eggs
01:31:07 in one basket if you're like
01:31:09 it depends on the circumstance
01:31:11 I mean if you think you've got the
01:31:13 masterpiece of the century
01:31:15 in your mind and like if you just
01:31:17 drop out of school for a year and work on it
01:31:19 you're gonna fucking blow the world away with your novel
01:31:21 but you really gotta think about like
01:31:23 how much time is it gonna take
01:31:25 you know are you actually
01:31:27 capable of delivering on it
01:31:29 get some opinions see how people react to it
01:31:31 who would you know find someone
01:31:33 who would enjoy it and show it to them
01:31:35 and see if they do
01:31:37 enjoy it you know
01:31:39 you know the story of disney
01:31:41 and snow white and how he had like
01:31:43 to I think what's the word mortgage
01:31:45 his house or something like that
01:31:47 he put a lot of his savings and like
01:31:49 basically he was like risking it all
01:31:51 the cuphead developers just did that
01:31:53 remortgage their houses to make cuphead
01:31:55 they did that was a big blood story
01:31:57 I mean lots of people have done it but like
01:31:59 in those cases like
01:32:01 we're talking about disney
01:32:03 is making a movie with some of the best animation
01:32:05 quality that had ever been done
01:32:07 so like there's almost guaranteed
01:32:09 an audience when you know for a fact
01:32:11 that you were doing something of like a technical
01:32:13 level of craftsmanship above
01:32:15 anything else anyone's doing and if you were doing
01:32:17 that you would know you were doing it
01:32:19 cause you would be able to observe everyone
01:32:21 else and you know everything about their
01:32:23 we hear a lot of like anecdotal stories
01:32:25 about like you know successful people
01:32:27 who are risking it all but like we hear about
01:32:29 those examples cause they're successful
01:32:31 there's like dozens and hundreds and thousands
01:32:33 of people who've done the same thing and got
01:32:35 totally fucked when you look
01:32:37 at the cuphead development like of course
01:32:39 they remortgaged their house cause the first time
01:32:41 they took that game to E3 it was fucking all
01:32:43 anyone was talking about so they knew they had
01:32:45 a hit on their hands like they would be stupid
01:32:47 or not to do it if they were passionate enough
01:32:49 to finish the project you know and make sure
01:32:51 it was good but that's like
01:32:53 so you gotta look at it different
01:32:55 you gotta you know think about risk differently
01:32:57 from just oh they remortgaged their house
01:32:59 they took a huge risk it's like yeah
01:33:01 they took a huge risk on a sure thing you know
01:33:03 so it's not really a risk at all
01:33:05 I just like I want to pull up how many subs
01:33:07 this guy just get a feel for what success
01:33:09 he's gotten at the moment he has one
01:33:11 video that's got like something like
01:33:13 500,000 views his youtube channel
01:33:15 has about 26,000 subscribers
01:33:17 like the fact of the matter is
01:33:19 he is not that successful yes
01:33:21 I think honestly what
01:33:23 this guy this man had was a dangerous
01:33:25 thing is that he got a little
01:33:27 too much taste of success
01:33:29 and kind of addled his brains I think that's
01:33:31 what ruins like most youtubers
01:33:33 like I think a lot of the youtubers who
01:33:35 end up only being around for a couple years
01:33:37 it's cause one thing
01:33:39 plays into like the algorithm just right
01:33:41 or maybe even a few videos for a little while
01:33:43 and like you know you just
01:33:45 take off and then
01:33:47 as soon as you don't have that weird
01:33:49 magical foothold that like whatever youtube's
01:33:51 algorithm was at that moment just happened
01:33:53 to like align perfectly with your shit
01:33:55 then you know you might fall off
01:33:57 if your fans don't actually care about you
01:33:59 I watched a bunch of this guy's videos
01:34:01 and he talked about how like
01:34:03 when he started this vlog like yeah I was about to release a video
01:34:05 you know I was really hoping
01:34:07 that would be the one that blew up
01:34:09 and he says like maybe it'll take like a week
01:34:11 maybe it'll take a month maybe it'll take a couple months
01:34:13 for me to succeed but like we're talking about a man
01:34:15 building up his music career like
01:34:17 from the ground floor this should not be
01:34:19 an idea of like within days
01:34:21 I'll have made it no
01:34:23 I could tell just by listening to his videos
01:34:25 he has a way warped sense of time
01:34:27 for what he thinks this is gonna be
01:34:29 I watched some of the music videos like not
01:34:31 good and he has people cringing
01:34:33 at his videos like this is the kind of guy
01:34:35 we're talking about it just it scares me
01:34:37 man this is a guy I think it was a victim
01:34:39 of kind of the the
01:34:41 weird success I would
01:34:43 call a victim he's choosing this
01:34:45 he's doing well all I'm saying is that I think
01:34:47 he's he's under he's experiencing some
01:34:49 confirmation bias in what
01:34:51 he's doing and he sees all the success people
01:34:53 and he thinks if I just and you know what
01:34:55 if this guy makes it everyone
01:34:57 will say like oh well look at all the haters man
01:34:59 he will say like look at all the haters who doubted
01:35:01 me but the thing is what matters is not
01:35:03 whether he succeeds or not what matters
01:35:05 was the degree of risk he was willing
01:35:07 to expose himself to and for some
01:35:09 people they can expose themselves to a little
01:35:11 risk and have it pay off great guys like me
01:35:13 are extremely conservative about this kind
01:35:15 of things and do not put a lot of risk into what they do
01:35:17 but like I would argue
01:35:19 this guy put it way too much
01:35:21 I'll tell you right now I consider
01:35:23 myself a huge risk taker but like
01:35:25 yeah not in the way
01:35:27 like I only take the big risk after
01:35:29 I've already got you know
01:35:31 ten thousand dollars saved up
01:35:33 and I'm like
01:35:35 you know sure that they have to
01:35:37 make sure everything's set up you know it I'm going
01:35:39 to make a big leap but I'm gonna
01:35:41 make sure I fucking have gauged the
01:35:43 distance that I'm jumping you know like
01:35:45 we say you're not as spontaneous in that way
01:35:47 I well you know before I
01:35:49 make the leap I lick my finger
01:35:51 and I hold it up and I feel the winds
01:35:53 and I determine which way they're blowing
01:35:55 you know then I'll make a calculated
01:35:57 risk taker exactly
01:35:59 I think there's a lot of people who just
01:36:01 are just straight up
01:36:03 don't even know what they're supposed to be looking for
01:36:05 they just see a hole and they think they
01:36:07 can jump over it and they don't even realize
01:36:09 that they don't have legs you know like
01:36:11 yeah there's people like that on
01:36:13 YouTube
01:36:15 all right true man Munchy you wanted to do the next
01:36:17 question yes yes by
01:36:19 J8 the hurricane and
01:36:21 the questions bar what is the PCP's
01:36:23 Mass Effect 3
01:36:25 something so disappointing that you retroactively
01:36:27 hate all the related content that comes before
01:36:29 it something that we made
01:36:31 or something that we feel like that
01:36:33 about I think he I think
01:36:35 what he meant was like what do we
01:36:37 feel is the case right maybe
01:36:39 John Tron historically was kind of like
01:36:41 I wanted to take this the way that like
01:36:43 what have we created that we
01:36:45 hate like that like like retroactively
01:36:47 we now hate it and be like
01:36:49 I'm so embarrassed
01:36:51 there's nothing
01:36:53 I've made that makes me
01:36:55 hate retroactively all the
01:36:57 things I've made before it I don't think
01:36:59 that's what he's asking I think he means like
01:37:01 but is there a piece of content that you are
01:37:03 like oh I shouldn't have made that
01:37:05 my fucking pony vids
01:37:07 you're what
01:37:09 but mage they were your foothold to
01:37:11 stepping stone you know whatever
01:37:13 pony vans do you say
01:37:15 pony things
01:37:17 are pretty successful some of them
01:37:19 yeah I don't regret T-Bab at all
01:37:21 yeah but now I'm
01:37:23 stuck in the pony fandom
01:37:25 shadow and like three or four years later
01:37:27 people still like poke me
01:37:29 about the pony things and I'm just like I'm done
01:37:31 with this
01:37:33 you definitely did not make as hard of a cut
01:37:35 as the fellow guys here did
01:37:37 I did I made an announcement
01:37:39 I told people
01:37:41 I fucking I'm not drunk
01:37:43 in what ways is this just that people ask
01:37:45 you about pony because that doesn't seem like a major
01:37:47 issue if they just kind of ask you about
01:37:49 it people still make a keg and phantom
01:37:51 fan art and I love it
01:37:53 and the rest of the crew was great
01:37:55 chat up to acro
01:37:57 kill it as always
01:37:59 fucking of arm retrieval like a veteran
01:38:01 general of arm retrieval
01:38:03 acro is fucking incredible
01:38:05 I get sometimes people just actively denying
01:38:07 that I left the fandom and I'm just like
01:38:09 wake up
01:38:11 grab a brush and put a little makeup
01:38:13 yeah
01:38:15 exactly
01:38:17 I definitely think I oh sorry
01:38:19 maybe she can continue
01:38:21 I make it sound
01:38:23 worse than it is actually
01:38:25 some of the things
01:38:27 in the pony thing
01:38:29 the lethal halloween thing I'm kind of embarrassed
01:38:31 by it because it's really really bad
01:38:33 but people really like it
01:38:35 so I'm kind of really embarrassed by it
01:38:37 that's fair enough
01:38:39 there's a lot of my videos I'm embarrassed
01:38:41 by like
01:38:43 because generally my
01:38:45 writing style and taste
01:38:47 evolve over time and sometimes I rewatch
01:38:49 some old shit and I'm just like
01:38:51 what the fuck am I talking about
01:38:53 why did I make this
01:38:55 why did I think this is okay
01:38:57 but like most of it is stuff that
01:38:59 I think I appreciate
01:39:01 why people would have liked it at the time
01:39:03 there's very few videos that I've made that were like
01:39:05 when they came out
01:39:07 they were DOA and like the mario
01:39:09 odyssey video I made is definitely
01:39:11 one of them where like
01:39:13 I was just like
01:39:15 I don't know why I made that video
01:39:17 because I knew that the only way I was going to
01:39:19 convince anybody of my point is by doing
01:39:21 like an in depth analytical breakdown
01:39:23 a la mathematosis
01:39:25 and I'm sure that when his video comes out
01:39:27 he probably will
01:39:29 criticize the visuals of that game because
01:39:31 I trust him to fucking have sense
01:39:33 but um
01:39:35 I jumped the gun and just made something quick
01:39:37 and I thought that if I open it by just being like
01:39:39 yo this is a goofy video
01:39:41 like people would be okay with it
01:39:43 but they were not
01:39:45 they're pretty rabid about that
01:39:47 yeah so it was just
01:39:49 it just didn't need to exist
01:39:51 it was just a PR disaster
01:39:53 basically like it was just me coming out
01:39:55 with an unpopular opinion
01:39:57 not defending it well and then just having people
01:39:59 be like well we disagree
01:40:01 and we hate you for having made this
01:40:03 even brought this to the attention
01:40:05 of the world in the first place
01:40:07 Gigi didn't that like fucking stupid
01:40:09 vlog video have like rebuttal
01:40:11 videos and like it did
01:40:13 like it was like taking you down
01:40:15 who the fuck cares
01:40:17 dude I can't I can't believe
01:40:19 this is why I don't make videos about video games
01:40:21 like cause it's not worth it
01:40:23 it's not something that I made
01:40:25 but I guess probably the thing I'm most
01:40:27 ashamed of would be a analysis
01:40:29 anarchy
01:40:31 being associated with that
01:40:33 I just watched that the other day
01:40:35 in fact
01:40:37 does it hold up
01:40:39 is it as good as I remember
01:40:41 I showed it to all my offline friends
01:40:43 to specifically show you
01:40:45 Ben I showed them
01:40:47 to like be like you know that guy
01:40:49 I know that guy he's my friend
01:40:51 jesus
01:40:53 awful awful so that's the first thing they know of you
01:40:55 okay well I guess that's what I deserve
01:40:59 Ben's part
01:41:01 the silver quill quip
01:41:03 I remember being the only kind of funny part
01:41:05 yeah I didn't read the script
01:41:07 I just looked at my like two lines
01:41:09 and I thought alright well these aren't terrible
01:41:11 I'll read them and then I watched the whole video
01:41:13 and it's like so it goes so
01:41:15 downhill from there
01:41:17 like once the actual plot gets underway it's like
01:41:19 oh my god this is
01:41:21 this is what we're doing no please
01:41:23 oh shameful
01:41:25 oh yes
01:41:27 that reminds me that I
01:41:29 have to do something similar for a guy's
01:41:31 abridged series
01:41:33 that someone just like
01:41:35 messaged me like hey will you do a voice in
01:41:37 my abridged series on black
01:41:39 clover or whatever and I was like
01:41:41 sure as long as he said there's only be a couple
01:41:43 lines I'm like sure and then I get the lines
01:41:45 and I am
01:41:47 first of all I'll have way more than a couple lines
01:41:49 and second of all my character
01:41:51 is all quotes from my videos
01:41:53 so
01:41:55 what?
01:41:57 he sent me the script
01:41:59 and I didn't actually read it for a straight week
01:42:01 and by the time I read it everyone else had done
01:42:03 their lines so I'm like
01:42:05 now I kind of feel like I have to do it
01:42:07 because like I'm the only one
01:42:09 holding this thing up but like I hadn't read it
01:42:11 beforehand so I'm just like oh god
01:42:13 yeah you fucked up a little bit
01:42:15 but I should probably
01:42:17 do that performance today
01:42:19 cause that guy's been asking me for weeks
01:42:21 and I have just been ignoring it
01:42:23 there is an
01:42:25 uncanny valley type situation
01:42:27 for embarrassing content for me
01:42:29 because like if I go back in my past
01:42:31 and I read all the role plays or something
01:42:33 they are hilarious they are great
01:42:35 they do not even like
01:42:37 I cannot imagine it was like to be
01:42:39 like tin and writing role plays
01:42:41 I can't imagine I am
01:42:43 not that person so it's funny to
01:42:45 like look back and be like oh wasn't this
01:42:47 silly wasn't this a cringy you know funny time
01:42:49 ha ha ha but the closer
01:42:51 you get to being actually
01:42:53 real life me and the more embarrassing it gets
01:42:55 it gets to be like oh I remember
01:42:57 writing that
01:42:59 how many years
01:43:01 before like munchie pissing on stream
01:43:03 is like his worst memory
01:43:05 of all his whole life no that won't
01:43:07 that will never be the case
01:43:09 pissing on games I can't
01:43:11 I can't wait for the new segment munchie vs munchie
01:43:13 in like three years fucking ten
01:43:15 ten years from now when he's like running
01:43:17 for office cause he's become like
01:43:19 really politically minded and stuff
01:43:21 literally his career is ruined
01:43:23 by the time he pissed on PCP
01:43:25 cause like everyone has files of it
01:43:27 oh god well ok ok
01:43:29 if I do decide to run
01:43:31 for office literally the entirety
01:43:33 of like me saying this right now
01:43:35 will be an embarrassment and will be the worst thing
01:43:37 that I've done I just
01:43:39 resigned myself to the fact that I will never
01:43:41 be a politician because I just could not be
01:43:43 there's just no way that I could be
01:43:45 I've resigned myself to the fact that I probably can't hold
01:43:47 any job anymore cause like any
01:43:49 background check on me it's just gonna turn up
01:43:51 like a bunch of fucking weird
01:43:53 troll videos and shit like
01:43:55 you'll need to be some sort of
01:43:57 like social influencer or like
01:43:59 a writer for a magazine like working at like
01:44:01 a McDonald's or something would be like yeah
01:44:03 they look that up and it's like well what the fuck is this about
01:44:05 but then again hopefully it wouldn't
01:44:07 come to that point
01:44:09 yeah excellent I've been
01:44:11 using the same name for like
01:44:13 like so long now that like my entire
01:44:15 history is documented
01:44:17 so it's like it's like like no matter what
01:44:19 like I will never be able to like escape
01:44:21 I don't know anyone I'm trying to do
01:44:23 I'm just saying that like the closer you get
01:44:25 to like me right now
01:44:27 like it's again like a valley
01:44:29 so like if I were to go two
01:44:31 years back I would probably be like
01:44:33 oh god why did I say do these things
01:44:35 but if I go like like five years back
01:44:37 I'll be like I don't even remember this
01:44:39 there's no way I could
01:44:41 have done this like this is not
01:44:43 I've seen a few things on my blog
01:44:45 that I'm legit like there's like
01:44:47 this is impossible there's no way I had
01:44:49 this opinion that goes in the shell
01:44:51 standalone complex it's the ugliest anime
01:44:53 and stuff like that
01:44:55 so alright nice
01:44:57 question
01:44:59 sandalwood asks what's the most at
01:45:01 drill thing you've ever done
01:45:03 Ben I want to know
01:45:05 you got an answer
01:45:07 oh man
01:45:09 I bet I could think of some
01:45:11 you know what
01:45:13 give me a second I'll be right back
01:45:15 you know Ben I'm gonna say
01:45:17 okay
01:45:19 I feel like those things that the
01:45:21 PCP have done together could fit
01:45:23 into a drill tweet like the group
01:45:25 shit that might be a pretty
01:45:27 at drill thing I think
01:45:29 the group shit was very real
01:45:31 taking a group shit at BrodyCon with
01:45:33 five internet people that I'm
01:45:35 fucking living with now
01:45:37 I'm looking at I pulled up drills twitter
01:45:39 here's a recent one from February 16
01:45:41 so yesterday
01:45:43 time to look at the moments tab
01:45:45 I lay down in the bathtub and a guy smears
01:45:47 shit all over my chest with his ass
01:45:49 while using a taser on me
01:45:51 there you go yeah pretty yeah
01:45:53 you know take it five man group shit
01:45:55 at BrodyCon with my internet buddies
01:45:57 that's a drill tweet
01:45:59 I agree
01:46:01 whenever it comes
01:46:03 to questions like this
01:46:05 I almost feel like I haven't done anything with my life
01:46:07 but even though
01:46:09 I have like a reputation for being like crazy
01:46:11 they like I think
01:46:13 about them so much that it's like that doesn't even
01:46:15 feel weird to me I mean pissing on stream
01:46:17 is pretty fucking at drill
01:46:19 that's true and fucking
01:46:21 walking up and down my like
01:46:23 rich white like town
01:46:25 like in full pizza and top hat
01:46:27 pizza ones even top hat
01:46:29 I am a prince from Africa and I will buy out
01:46:31 every small business and because I am the
01:46:33 I'm the owner of Microsoft that's
01:46:35 pretty at drill that's very at drill
01:46:37 because you brought up that exact example
01:46:39 just listen to this question just as an insert
01:46:41 to this larger question this is from the
01:46:43 from the twitter
01:46:45 hashtag askpcp everybody
01:46:47 how is it that only six years ago
01:46:49 munchy was a small baby boy
01:46:51 swaddled in the garments of a slain Arab prince
01:46:53 while baptized in the blood of 100 maidens
01:46:55 sounds pretty relevant
01:46:57 it's amazing to see
01:46:59 my growth from your six years ago
01:47:01 being a baby
01:47:03 it's a shame he had to give up his claim to the throne of Dubai
01:47:05 but nonetheless he's made the best of the situation
01:47:07 it's a shame I had to stop being a Nigerian prince
01:47:09 to do anime raps on the internet
01:47:11 and then I had to you know crash the people
01:47:13 because that was homeless that's a real shame
01:47:15 I have to imagine that Ben has
01:47:17 gone off into the bathroom stripped naked
01:47:19 and is just like fucking flailing himself
01:47:21 with a trout right now
01:47:23 which ironically enough is
01:47:25 which ironically enough is pretty drill itself
01:47:27 yeah
01:47:29 yeah just the tweet would be like
01:47:31 trying to make some shit happen
01:47:33 for the podcast I'm on
01:47:35 left the bathroom to beat myself with a trout
01:47:37 nothing's happening
01:47:39 you know something like that
01:47:41 something like that
01:47:43 um well well
01:47:45 I mean tweet drill is really all about
01:47:47 his brand right
01:47:49 like everything drill does
01:47:51 he does for the drill brand
01:47:53 and he's always wheeling and dealing
01:47:57 I don't know I just
01:47:59 like the only thing that comes to mind
01:48:01 that's particularly drill-ish
01:48:03 is like there's nothing in specific
01:48:05 but there's just like
01:48:07 I don't know everywhere I've always lived
01:48:09 people have remarked that like I just do things
01:48:11 in a strange way
01:48:13 and they don't know like I'll just
01:48:15 assemble food in like a bizarre order
01:48:17 that doesn't make any or I'll just like throw things
01:48:19 together and people are like
01:48:21 Ben why do you do that and I'm always like
01:48:23 and I'm always like I don't know why anyone doesn't
01:48:25 do it this way like that's just
01:48:27 my stock answer is like I don't understand
01:48:29 why everyone doesn't do everything the way that I do
01:48:31 which seems like kind of a drill
01:48:33 that's that's a fairly drill sentiment
01:48:35 I guess all right I got one more
01:48:37 question at zeno grade
01:48:39 asks what quote do you want
01:48:41 carved onto your tombstone
01:48:43 I was about to do this one I want
01:48:45 the classic my
01:48:47 my heartbeat clips the microphone that should be on my
01:48:49 that's a good one especially from
01:48:51 a fucking corpse
01:48:53 yeah yeah exactly
01:48:55 I know I had an answer
01:48:57 I definitely I'm just thinking
01:48:59 because I know I had some answers for this
01:49:01 but I can't remember them right now I'm still banking
01:49:03 on on me oh
01:49:05 weaponized I think it's for the force
01:49:07 yeah that's what
01:49:09 I'll weaponize
01:49:11 and thickness with Jesus
01:49:13 that's what I want
01:49:15 maybe some questions from the cue
01:49:17 my kerfuffle you know you gotta bring back
01:49:19 your pass you don't even know me at all
01:49:21 don't understand the meaning of my fall what my family
01:49:23 would think if I ever failed at anything
01:49:25 that's what I want to buy
01:49:27 I had to fight
01:49:29 for my tombstone I'd be like
01:49:31 brb respawning
01:49:33 oh dude
01:49:35 is she a gamer girl holy shit
01:49:37 my tombstone just say the living
01:49:39 mage your tombstone should just have
01:49:41 like the hexadecimal code for
01:49:43 purple on audit
01:49:45 that's a good idea
01:49:47 you know I want a QR code
01:49:49 that leads to like an ARG
01:49:51 that's inspired oh my god that would be so
01:49:53 fucking dope yeah that's what I want
01:49:55 yeah that's it
01:49:57 just have a tombstone
01:49:59 just says like comment subscribe
01:50:01 that's how you
01:50:03 you sign off from life
01:50:05 that's a good one
01:50:07 the idea of a posthumous ARG
01:50:09 is the most appealing concept
01:50:11 between the entire fucking world
01:50:13 I hope
01:50:15 that I still have this interest when I am in fact
01:50:17 dead
01:50:19 the idea of like
01:50:21 doing an ARG and instead of like slender
01:50:23 man it's a real life
01:50:25 actual corpse that is dead
01:50:27 looking up on there and wow he's dead
01:50:29 ghost that is fucking dope
01:50:31 you gotta figure this out you gotta start laying
01:50:33 the breadcrumbs now you gotta start leaving
01:50:35 clues in PCP episodes
01:50:37 that's true
01:50:39 the final link will be me
01:50:41 we'll be a time stamp
01:50:43 oh yes
01:50:45 exactly incredible
01:50:47 no one else have anything Ben
01:50:49 what was the question
01:50:51 what would you have on your tombstone
01:50:53 oh god
01:50:55 now I'm embarrassed because I just thought
01:50:57 of a really great
01:50:59 tombstone etching that I remember
01:51:01 I heard someone talking about
01:51:03 but now I'm remembering that the person I heard
01:51:05 talking about it was Danny from Game Grumps
01:51:07 and I don't want to just repeat something that was said
01:51:09 on Game Grumps so I'm gonna gracefully bow out
01:51:11 you've given him credit now I'm just curious
01:51:13 what it is we understand it's his
01:51:15 it was like it was a poem
01:51:17 as you are now
01:51:19 so once was I as I
01:51:21 am now so you shall be
01:51:23 it was kind of like a passive aggressive
01:51:25 little poem about like yeah I'm dead but
01:51:27 fuck you
01:51:29 very good
01:51:31 Game Grumps
01:51:33 Game Grumps guys
01:51:35 the Game Grumps are here
01:51:37 among us
01:51:39 my tombstone I
01:51:41 specifically want this if I
01:51:43 live incredibly long
01:51:45 but I want it to just be like hey hey every
01:51:47 pony he left us I want to
01:51:49 only if I live
01:51:51 incredibly long I want it to be
01:51:53 like he left us too soon
01:51:55 or something like
01:51:57 like life is brief or something like that
01:51:59 and just like I live like 120
01:52:01 years or something yeah
01:52:03 here lies the otaku
01:52:05 gonzo corpse and forever may he
01:52:07 rest
01:52:09 may he never rise from this
01:52:11 crypt as he has several times
01:52:13 security never return
01:52:17 I think we saw all there is to say on
01:52:19 the topic of nature is
01:52:21 death good is nature death
01:52:23 yes we are going to die right now
01:52:25 who wins in a fight nature or nurture
01:52:27 who's stronger I was trying
01:52:29 to figure out how to make a fucking
01:52:31 versus nurture joke the whole show
01:52:33 but eventually an hour had passed and I was
01:52:35 like we don't need to go on this tangent
01:52:37 nurture wins I'm saying nurture nurture wins
01:52:39 other episode on nurture I would love that
01:52:41 you know a good idea literally press
