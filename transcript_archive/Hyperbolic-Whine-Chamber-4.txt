00:00:00 Oh my god! We did it! We're back! Max Revive Hyperbolic 1 Chamber! We did it guys! It's
00:00:16 only been fucking 10 million months, but we're back. We did it! Max Revive Tommy Oliver TV.
00:00:22 Go check out the link in the description. I put out six, seven videos in two weeks. Fucking
00:00:26 amazing! Did that and now we're back here for the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber to bitch about
00:00:31 shit! Yes! Today we have a new wine on the wine chamber we haven't had yet. Tis the season
00:00:40 for this wine. We're going basic bitch and basic bro at the same time. Today we are drinking
00:00:46 Captain Morgan's Jackoblast Pumpkin Spiced Rum. Mixed with a little bit of Coca-Cola for
00:00:55 good measure. It's fucking gay and I love it. If you would like to donate to the wine
00:01:02 funds so I can try more wines on the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber, link to my PayPal is in the
00:01:09 description down below. I've also decided to try and make the show more frequent since
00:01:14 I don't know what to bitch about all the time. You can, in addition to sending some money
00:01:19 and suggesting a wine, you can also suggest a topic for me to bitch about. So if there's
00:01:24 something you want to vicariously get off your chest, let me know, send some money, suggest
00:01:30 a wine, suggest a topic and I'll fucking tear it a new asshole. So with that out of the
00:01:36 way, I have no one to recommend or thank for donating this wine. I bought it myself. However,
00:01:42 I still need to give a shout out to someone for this episode and that is going to be Matt
00:01:48 on Twitter at Techtonic Improv because they messaged me about five or so days ago saying
00:01:57 that they were still waiting for my defense of Dungeons and Dragons because if you remember,
00:02:02 resident shitfucker Ben Sainte has constantly shit on Dungeons and Dragons and told everybody
00:02:10 that it's not fun and it's impossible to have fun playing Dungeons and Dragons. When you
00:02:13 know what? He's fucking wrong. D&D is a fantastic game. Tabletop is a fantastic medium and it
00:02:21 shouldn't be shit on by this contrarian motherfucker. It's good shit with an asterisk because Dungeons
00:02:31 and Dragons' biggest strength is also its greatest weakness. It requires people, those
00:02:37 motherfucking shitstains that everybody hates. Yes, people is the key to D&D's appeal and also
00:02:44 the chink in its armor because it makes it difficult to have the game be in an optimal
00:02:49 condition because you have to understand what makes Dungeons and Dragons a good or a bad experience
00:02:55 is entirely dependent upon the people you are playing with. D&D's rulesets, D&D's lore,
00:03:04 D&D's mechanics on its own, not very interesting. Everything is dependent upon the people you're
00:03:12 playing with and how they play the game and most importantly the Dungeon Master and how creative
00:03:19 and interesting they are. Finding a good DM is incredibly difficult, especially in this age
00:03:24 where everyone is fucking used to instant gratification and shit. You got to have somebody
00:03:29 with a little bit, a little bit going on upstairs if you get what I mean. They got to be smart,
00:03:32 they got to be quick, they got to be creative, they got to be able to make shit up on the fly
00:03:36 because the Dungeon Master, despite being probably the biggest barrier to playing something like
00:03:41 D&D as opposed to any other tabletop or board game where you have a bunch of people like,
00:03:45 hey, I want to play the game. You want to play the game? Let's play the game. We sit down at the
00:03:49 table, we open up the box, everybody picks their dude and you start playing the game. You know,
00:03:53 I got a bunch of games like that sitting on my chauffeur behind me like Mage Wars,
00:03:56 portrayal of the house on the hill, even something more simple like Bunchkin. All you got to do,
00:04:00 sit down, play the game. The game basically runs itself and you just do the player part of
00:04:04 the interaction. However, Dungeons & Dragons requires a human on the opposite side of the
00:04:11 spectrum as well. You need someone to be playing the game itself. You know, the game doesn't run
00:04:18 on autopilot and the players just have their interactions. You need the opposition, the
00:04:22 challenge to have a human involved as well. And this makes it very difficult to get into D&D
00:04:28 because finding people want to play D&D is easy. Finding people who want to actually run the campaign
00:04:33 is very difficult. It requires a lot more. However, when you find a good DM, that's where
00:04:38 the magic happens, okay? Because the biggest strength of Dungeons & Dragons and other pen
00:04:44 and paper role playing games is that they break free of the biggest restraint of games in general.
00:04:53 And that is the mechanics and the boundaries of the game itself. Video games are an amazing medium.
00:05:02 Board games are an amazing medium. Games in general is an amazing medium. However,
00:05:07 the biggest problem with things like games is that they limit the tool set available at your
00:05:14 disposal in order to get things done. When you play a video game, you are limited to interacting
00:05:22 with the game to how your character has been pre-assigned to do so. You have a limited move set.
00:05:30 You can only do certain techniques in the game that the developers have given you to use. When
00:05:36 you want to interact with characters in story segments and something like a role playing game,
00:05:40 you have pre-assigned statements that you can use and pre-assigned actions you can take. And
00:05:45 everything has to be done within the boundaries, within the sandbox that the developers have
00:05:51 designed for you because you're interacting with a machine with a scripted preset of options.
00:06:00 And you cannot go beyond those options without breaking the game in some way. If you go beyond
00:06:07 the options, that's usually a glitch. That's usually a mistake. It's something the developers
00:06:13 actively want to prevent you from doing. And the most successful games that feel the most immersive
00:06:18 are when they give you all the options that you can possibly think of wanting to do
00:06:25 because that makes you feel like you have a ton of options available to you. There's two ways
00:06:29 that a traditional game can attack this problem. You want to A, have a world that gives players
00:06:35 options, but at the same time you want to mentally railroad your players as well. You want to put them
00:06:40 in a situation where they feel as if all the options that they would think of are available to
00:06:48 them. And so you put them in a situation where the things they would think of doing are very limited
00:06:53 and then you give them those options. A game type that people never complain like, oh, it feels
00:06:59 limited is something like a fighting game. Because a fighting game is a one-on-one combat system.
00:07:05 And the only thing that you want to do when you sit down and play a fighting game is beat
00:07:09 the shit out of the guy on the other side of the screen. And the game gives you tons of ways of
00:07:12 doing that. So you never really feel like you're starved for options in a fighting game because
00:07:16 the entire game is crafted to only make you want to do one thing. You never play a fighting game
00:07:22 or like, man, I wish I could like talk it out because it's not an option. You know, when you're
00:07:27 in an RPG or something, there are times when you're just like, man, I wish I could have just like
00:07:30 tried a diplomatic option talking to this character. But if the game doesn't give you the option for
00:07:35 diplomacy, you have to engage in combat or you have to do certain things. Or it's like, man,
00:07:40 I wish I could have done a specific moveset, but I can't do any moves with my character
00:07:44 outside of these five or six different branching combo systems that I can earn through the game.
00:07:48 Games are limited. And that's the biggest problem with them. You have to work within their
00:07:53 mechanics. But what makes D&D so amazing, what makes D&D so fantastic is because it is not
00:08:00 constrained in the same way because of the Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master is a human being.
00:08:08 So because it's not a pre-programmed system, the DM can respond in real time to anything you
00:08:16 can think up. And this is the strength, the magic of D&D and pen and paper role playing,
00:08:23 is that the rules are not set in stone. The mechanics of the game are just a set of suggestions
00:08:32 and you are able to interact with the person. There's an actual person controlling the mechanisms
00:08:39 of the game. And so anything you can think up and do, they can respond to and assign that task
00:08:46 and push that specific idea you have and implement it into the rule structure of the game, because
00:08:51 everything's done around the D20 dice system. So anything you can think up can be assigned a
00:08:57 difficulty on a D20 role or some sort of variation thereof. So you can do anything you want in D&D.
00:09:05 You are not limited by a moveset. You're not limited by mechanics. You're not limited by
00:09:10 anything because you have a human being on the other side working the mechanics of the game
00:09:14 in charge of the system itself, because the system itself has just as much human power
00:09:19 and creativity behind it as the players playing the game, anything can happen. And this is why
00:09:25 the people you play D&D with are essential for having good time. I've played D&D with dumb
00:09:32 motherfuckers and all they want to do is kill shit. All they want to do is run into a dungeon,
00:09:38 roll dice, and slash things. And I'm just asking myself the entire time, why the fuck are we playing
00:09:43 D&D and not something like Dark Souls if you just want to run in a dungeon and slash things?
00:09:48 There's nothing more fun about rolling a dice and slashing something in D&D than there is
00:09:51 slashing something in a video game. A video game is designed to do that, to be a visceral
00:09:56 combat simulation. There's so many games that let you do that. D&D is so much more than that,
00:10:01 and that's why you need good people. You need players who are willing to think outside the box
00:10:06 and treat D&D as a pen and paper game where they can creatively solve problems as opposed to treating
00:10:12 it like a video game on a table where, oh, I'm just going to use my sword because it has plus
00:10:18 three strength and I'm going to roll. And that's what I'm going to do. That's boring. If you're
00:10:22 playing D&D like that, if you're playing D&D with a bunch of people who just want to play a fucking
00:10:26 video game, that's going to suck. And if you're playing with a DM that treats everything very basic,
00:10:31 that's going to suck. To play D&D and have a great time, you need to play with people who
00:10:36 understand the strengths of pen and paper and leverage it by never doing things just by the
00:10:44 book and trying to roll dice and approaching everything boring. You want people who really,
00:10:48 who want to literally role play, who want to become this character, think creatively in situations
00:10:55 and always be trying to do different and interesting things. They never just want to swing a sword or
00:11:01 cast magic missile. No, no, no, no. The people who are going to have a ton of fun playing D&D with
00:11:06 are people who want to start shit just to start shit. All right, I've said this story a couple
00:11:11 times on social media, but my favorite thing I've ever done in D&D is when I played a dragonborn
00:11:18 paladin who was a pacifist. He refused to fight anything because it was at a front to his god.
00:11:24 So I put all of his stats into charisma and diplomacy. All he would do was talk to people
00:11:29 and I gave him all of his beats. I just gave him a fuck ton of languages. And so we're on this
00:11:34 pirate ship or we're on a merchant ship and get attacked by pirates. And so everybody's upstairs
00:11:39 fighting the fucking pirates because that's what the DM wanted us to do. All right. And this is why
00:11:44 you need a good D&D DM as well so they can handle these situations that the person who's DMing can
00:11:52 respond to these creative things. So I said, I don't want to fight them. My guy would never fight.
00:11:56 He's going down into the cargo hold of the ship. He's going to pray. He's going to pray that the
00:12:01 conflict is resolved. And everyone's like pissing me like, what the fuck dude? You're like a big
00:12:05 fucking giant half dragon guy. Come help us fight. I don't have any weapons. I'm just going downstairs
00:12:10 and my guy's going to pray. So he goes down and he starts praying to his god. So the DM gets mad
00:12:15 at me and wants to force my hand into combat. So it's like the pirates breach the hull of the ship
00:12:20 and the cargo hold and a bunch of giant alligators that are in the water around us enter the cargo
00:12:27 hold. They're trying to kill you. They're trying to eat you. They're giant. They can actually eat you.
00:12:33 So if I just approach this as a video game, I'm like, I'm going to get out. I'll bear hand combat
00:12:38 them or I'll, you know, I'll do a perception check to see if I can find a sword or something down
00:12:42 here in the cargo hold. But no, I was like, hmm, I tried to fudge it. I tried to like, how can I
00:12:46 creatively think of a situation out of this that is going to keep me in character? My guy is a diplomat.
00:12:53 He likes to talk. He has an incredibly high charisma bonus and a stupidly high diplomacy check
00:13:02 and he knows a fuck ton of languages and he's part, he's part reptiles. So I'm like, I want to,
00:13:07 I want to, I want to talk to the alligators and they're like, are you fucking retarded? The DM's
00:13:11 like, looks at me like I'm idiot. Like you want to talk to the alligators. I'm like, yeah,
00:13:16 I want to try and talk to them. I know Draconic. I know a bunch of other weird primitive languages.
00:13:20 I'm going to try talking to them and I roll a natural 20 on it. And while everyone flees the
00:13:25 sinking ship on boats, I surf out on a giant fucking alligator who's not my best friend.
00:13:30 That is why D&D is the best fucking game of all time because you could never do something like that
00:13:36 in any other kind of medium. Pen and paper is magical when you have people who think creatively
00:13:42 and you have a dungeon master who is able to entertain those out of the box thoughts and
00:13:48 not only entertains them, but actively encourages them and wants to think creatively too. D&D
00:13:54 is so fucking good when people actually want to have fun with it. When they recognize and
00:14:00 appreciate the strength of pen and paper, the ability to adapt any idea into a gameplay
00:14:04 mechanic and you're not limited by prescripted tools and explore that to the best of your
00:14:08 abilities. Dungeons and Dragons is amazing if you play with the right people and it's so
00:14:12 fucking boring when you play with dumbasses who only treat it like a fucking video game
00:14:17 with no graphics. So find some people who are fun, play D&D, have a good time, drink some Captain
00:14:24 Morgan's Jackoblast, hyperbolic mindchamber out bitch!
