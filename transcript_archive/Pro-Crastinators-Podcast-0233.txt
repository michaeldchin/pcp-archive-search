00:00:00 We're recording, and maybe this will be in the episode, or maybe not.
00:00:08 Yeah, who the fuck knows?
00:00:09 Who knows?
00:00:10 It's a mystery.
00:00:11 I mean, if we sync later, you can still sync this all up too, so it's all good.
00:00:14 If we sync like the Titanic later, this will be our lifeboat.
00:00:19 That's every episode since Nate's left, am I right?
00:00:24 It was Nate's show.
00:00:25 I mean, it's not the same.
00:00:29 The Titanic is a happy ending, though, because the old lady got a locket or something.
00:00:35 No, she threw it into the ocean like an idiot.
00:00:41 Did she get it again?
00:00:43 They found it at the end, and they gave it to her, and she throws it into the ocean a
00:00:47 second time?
00:00:48 Is that how it goes?
00:00:49 No, she throws it into the ocean and dies.
00:00:51 Oh, well, I approve that.
00:00:52 I've never seen it.
00:00:54 That is not what happens at all.
00:00:56 I mean, I don't remember.
00:00:57 That could be what happens for all I know.
00:01:00 No.
00:01:01 I just remember that Leo died.
00:01:04 Yeah.
00:01:06 Leo!
00:01:08 My beautiful bull.
00:01:11 I saw a tweet, and it just got me.
00:01:15 I don't know why.
00:01:16 It's just a picture of Trump yelling.
00:01:19 Just Trump yelling, and the text is, I've abandoned my child.
00:01:23 I've abandoned my bull.
00:01:27 It's like, yeah.
00:01:29 OK.
00:01:30 We've all been there.
00:01:32 My child.
00:01:37 Dude, I'm watching, I watched like the town hall with Trump.
00:01:40 Oh, man, that was, that was hard to get through.
00:01:43 Oh, was that the one at the same time that Biden was doing one?
00:01:46 Yeah.
00:01:47 The what?
00:01:48 I didn't check out either.
00:01:50 Yeah, I watched them both.
00:01:51 I'm a fucking scrub.
00:01:53 I mean, give me the highlights.
00:01:56 It's really hard to just highlight it.
00:01:58 The man is just so dumb, so fucking dumb.
00:02:02 It's really hard.
00:02:04 Somebody said, did you see the thing about like Hunter Biden this week?
00:02:09 You know, I heard about it, but I haven't like watched anything.
00:02:12 I saw that image of him being like, I want to go to the anime realm.
00:02:17 And then Joe Biden gives him a bong and he smokes it and he sees anime.
00:02:22 Is that what happened?
00:02:23 Whoa, I'm voting for Biden now.
00:02:25 That sounds awesome.
00:02:26 That's what happened.
00:02:27 Well, it's like, I guess Hunter is on the one hand some sort of like oil company
00:02:33 executive, but also like a complete fuck up crack head, like a literal crack head.
00:02:38 Sounds about right.
00:02:39 Like pictures of him smoking crack.
00:02:42 And, and I guess I didn't read them, but I guess some texts leaked of like Hunter.
00:02:48 Like, you know, I get maybe check himself into rehab.
00:02:51 It is, you know, having a fucking crisis or whatever.
00:02:54 And it's like text between like Joe and Hunter.
00:02:57 And I guess Joe is like, you know, very much like, I love you no matter what, you know,
00:03:03 I'll always love you son or whatever.
00:03:05 It's that kind of thing.
00:03:06 And it's like, I guess Rudy Giuliani leaked these thinking that they were like going
00:03:11 to be damning to him because, oh, your son's a crack head.
00:03:13 But like everyone I've seen is like, this is like really humanizing and, and is like,
00:03:19 even like the people that I follow that all hate Biden are like, even I felt something
00:03:23 for Biden in this, in this read in this shit.
00:03:26 Right.
00:03:27 Oh God, the man loves his son.
00:03:29 That's that.
00:03:30 Yeah.
00:03:31 That's going to go really well.
00:03:32 Like, yeah, what a piece of shit loving his son despite his faults.
00:03:35 Treating him like a human being.
00:03:37 Wow.
00:03:38 Amazing.
00:03:39 Incredible.
00:03:40 That's almost like, like it wasn't leaked by someone who's trying to, you know, fuck
00:03:47 him up.
00:03:48 It was leaked.
00:03:49 It's Joe and Hunter Biden making fake, making fake text messages that then leaked to Rudy
00:03:54 Giuliani so he can leak them.
00:03:56 Like it was all a ploy.
00:03:57 It was a 40 chess move.
00:03:59 Hey, some pretend that I love you for a minute.
00:04:02 Okay.
00:04:03 Yeah.
00:04:04 Secretly by Joe got his own, his son addicted to crack intentionally so that stage this
00:04:13 whole, this whole long play and he, and he arranged for Bo to die of brain cancer too
00:04:19 so that he could have a humanizing, a tragic backstory.
00:04:22 Oh my God.
00:04:24 And then when the cameras on Joe will kick his son like a puppy.
00:04:30 Me.
00:04:31 Meanwhile, like there's a, there's a thing from, from Trump.
00:04:34 There's like some, I guess, like when his first son was being born, I think Baron, that's
00:04:38 Baron's his first son, right?
00:04:40 They're like, no, we're like, Baron's his youngest son.
00:04:43 Oh, no, no, no.
00:04:44 Don.
00:04:45 Don Jr.
00:04:46 Is that?
00:04:47 Or who?
00:04:48 No, he's not the oldest one.
00:04:49 I don't know who the oldest one is, but I guess when his first son was being born, his
00:04:52 wife wanted to, his wife wanted to name him Don Jr. and Trump said like, no, I don't name
00:04:57 him Don Jr.
00:04:58 What if he's a loser?
00:05:00 That's kind of based.
00:05:03 A little bit.
00:05:05 Someone said like, you know, I don't like Biden, but this shit is really endearing.
00:05:09 And I, I responded like, Trump says stuff that endears me to him all the time, in that
00:05:15 it's like funny and it makes me laugh.
00:05:18 Like that gift of him making all the funny faces like, this is a funny man, this orange
00:05:24 man's still bad, but like, you know, anyway, this is all in like, you know, you can, we
00:05:28 can, we can, we can all, we can all be like, oh, oh, yeah, pretty, pretty good that Joe
00:05:33 loves his son, but also support Medicare for all, please.
00:05:36 Yeah.
00:05:37 He may care for his son, but that doesn't mean he'll care for us, the sons of America.
00:05:43 No.
00:05:44 Or we.
00:05:45 No, indeed.
00:05:46 What do you mean us?
00:05:47 Yeah.
00:05:48 Fucking British man.
00:05:49 Yeah, who are you?
00:05:50 Nothing.
00:05:51 Nothing.
00:05:52 Give his, give his trans America.
00:05:54 Trans American.
00:05:55 Yeah, yeah.
00:05:57 The trans Atlantic Railroad.
00:06:01 Man, if you really want to like, fucking oppress yourself, become trans Atlantic, become an
00:06:07 American, you have to get, you have to, you have to give yourself COVID.
00:06:11 Like, sorry, that's just, that's just part of the process.
00:06:14 Just the way it is.
00:06:15 Oh, look who's in the chat.

00:07:10 Munchie is, Munchie is dead.
00:07:15 You know, you know, guys, I've watched all of your things, all of your lectures, like
00:07:20 multiple times.
00:07:21 Excellent.
00:07:22 That's so based.
00:07:23 Oh, it's a bad one.
00:07:25 Even the one I did.
00:07:26 Which one was that?
00:07:27 The brisco one.
00:07:30 What?
00:07:31 No, don't worry about that.
00:07:34 No.
00:07:35 Is that one I haven't watched yet?
00:07:37 I thought I watched all of them.
00:07:38 I guess.
00:07:39 It's relatively recently.
00:07:40 There was a couple of ones that came out a few months ago.
00:07:43 Like, I gave dude one on, on, on brisco.
00:07:46 I did one on Animorphs, which went over pretty well.
00:07:49 Ben did a.
00:07:51 I did Chris Chan 102, which is.
00:07:53 Oh yeah.
00:07:54 You haven't done that one yet.
00:07:55 Still in my fucking editing bay.
00:07:56 You haven't?
00:07:57 A family year later.
00:07:58 You better do it soon.
00:07:59 I know.
00:08:00 Yeah.
00:08:01 It's time.
00:08:02 It's, it's well, it's long past time.
00:08:04 So there's the, the Deagle Nation one, the hottest guys in the universe one, and the
00:08:09 360 Sonata 101.
00:08:12 I can't believe that 360 one exists.
00:08:14 What a, what a bizarre artifact.
00:08:16 It's pretty great.
00:08:18 It's pretty interesting.
00:08:20 All right.
00:08:21 Let's.
00:08:22 Hey, okay.
00:08:23 On the count of three is go one, two, three, and then we all say sync.
00:08:27 And just for our editor's sake, could you, when you sit, when you say sync, could you
00:08:32 like maybe wiggle your ears up?
00:08:35 I guess.
00:08:36 So our editor can, can, can sync the footage with the audio.
00:08:39 So when, when we say sync, I raise my eyebrows like this.
00:08:43 Yeah.
00:08:44 Yes.
00:08:45 Yes.
00:08:46 Okay.
00:08:47 Cool.
00:08:48 We'll do it twice.
00:08:49 Yeah.

00:08:51 We'll do it twice.
00:08:52 One, two, three.
00:08:53 Sync.
00:08:54 One, two, three.
00:08:57 Sync.
00:08:58 Very, very nice.
00:09:01 Okay.
00:09:02 I think, I think I have everything positioned so that it won't fuck up.
00:09:09 Let me just close my other windows here.
00:09:16 Yeah.
00:09:19 Okay.
00:09:21 Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the pro crass snators podcast.

00:09:42 My friend, Mary weather, who is a, is a cat boy was like a big, a big deal famous guy.
00:09:52 It's like a, he's like a internet content.
00:09:55 He's like an internet, internet fucking mogul over here.
00:09:59 No.
00:10:00 Yes.
00:10:01 And also he's a Vtuber now.
00:10:03 That's correct.
00:10:04 And there he is.
00:10:06 Look at, look at him go.
00:10:08 Yes.
00:10:09 He's like looking at that cat boy move.
00:10:12 It's, it's so sweet.
00:10:13 It's a dog boy.
00:10:14 I'm a dog.
00:10:15 I know.
00:10:16 I knew he was a dog.
00:10:17 Wolf.
00:10:18 What the fuck's a dog?
00:10:23 That's very much for having me on everyone.
00:10:26 I'm a big fan.
00:10:27 I'm glad you're here.
00:10:28 I'm a big fan of the pro crass to pay us boys.
00:10:33 Same.
00:10:34 That's its name.
00:10:35 The perspirated boys podcast radio show.
00:10:39 I enjoy when you, I enjoyed when you did the lecture on that guy.
00:10:46 What's his name again?
00:10:50 Paul Western, Paul Western Chandler, that one.
00:10:54 Yes.
00:10:55 Yeah.
00:10:56 Yeah.
00:10:57 Paul Joseph.
00:10:58 Paul Joseph.
00:10:59 Yeah.
00:11:00 Paul Joseph Westerns.
00:11:03 Yeah.
00:11:04 Chris, Chris Chan.
00:11:06 I think that's, I think that was probably the first thing we talked about, Mary.
00:11:11 I don't even remember.
00:11:12 I think, I think it was.
00:11:14 I think, I think it must, it must have been, we had, because I think around the time that
00:11:19 we started talking, you had not too recent, had not too long ago done an interview with
00:11:25 Chris on your other channel.
00:11:27 That's correct.
00:11:28 That's right.
00:11:30 And it was, I pride myself on that interview because what I was told afterwards is that
00:11:38 we didn't try to troll him.
00:11:40 Oh, sorry.
00:11:42 Yeah.
00:11:43 Um, trolling.
00:11:45 Yeah.
00:11:46 There's, there's a certain strain.
00:11:48 There's a certain strain of a, have you, you've, you've interacted with, with Christine
00:11:55 on the, like on Twitter.
00:11:57 Yeah.
00:11:58 Right.
00:11:59 A few times.
00:12:00 Do you, do you notice, do you notice like the tone of the replies that always happen?
00:12:05 Yeah.
00:12:06 Uh, whenever she does anything on Twitter is so negative and gross.
00:12:11 It feels like very, um, it's so overdone honestly.
00:12:15 I don't think, I don't think anyone's really trolled Christine in a funny or creative way
00:12:23 for many years.
00:12:25 Yeah.
00:12:26 Uh, the, the, the like, it's, it's, it's, it's sad.
00:12:30 Like you, I don't know.
00:12:31 She'll just like do, says anything and like, everyone's just immediately jumping on it,
00:12:37 even if it's something unremarkable.
00:12:39 Fifteen, like teenagers or something.
00:12:42 I don't know.
00:12:43 We'll, we'll just be in there like, uh, Chris, shut up.
00:12:48 You're delusional.
00:12:49 Like nobody, nobody likes you.
00:12:51 Nobody believes in the dimensional merge to get a job.
00:12:54 Yeah.
00:12:55 She'll just say like, I'm having a good day and everyone will go, no, you're not.
00:12:59 Oh, you, everyone hates you.
00:13:01 You're a terrible person.
00:13:03 It's very, it's very crazy.
00:13:05 All of the personal stuff.
00:13:06 The epitome of your reputation precedes you.
00:13:09 They always bring up like extremely personal stuff that only a complete lunatic would
00:13:13 know about.
00:13:14 Like this, like stuff about his mother and stuff.
00:13:17 Like, why do you care so much?
00:13:20 You're just trying to be an asshole.
00:13:23 Yeah.
00:13:24 That's right.
00:13:25 That's true.
00:13:26 Sad, but true.
00:13:28 Um, Mary, um, you, uh, do you want to, I don't know, I, I make comics sometimes and you've
00:13:37 made like a million, I also do comics sometimes.
00:13:41 You've made like a million fucking comics.
00:13:44 You have like, I, I don't think I can list them all.
00:13:49 Honestly.
00:13:50 I'm sorry.
00:13:51 That's okay.
00:13:52 That's all for you.
00:13:53 If you'd like me to.
00:13:54 Yeah, sure.
00:13:55 Go for it.
00:13:56 Winter moon, internet explore, everywhere and nowhere, stalker, stalker, my succubus
00:14:00 girlfriend, one million gold, fox girls are better, uh, console girls, meme girls and
00:14:06 spook man.
00:14:07 Nice.
00:14:08 I think I've seen the, I didn't know about seven was the internet explorer one.
00:14:13 I think I've read that.
00:14:16 You might have.
00:14:17 Yeah.
00:14:18 Posted it everywhere.
00:14:19 Yeah.
00:14:20 I've read, I've read that one.
00:14:22 And I read, um, I read most of, wait, you did.
00:14:26 Did you say crawling dreams?
00:14:28 Yeah.
00:14:29 I read most of crawling dreams because I like the girl with the big boobs.
00:14:34 You guys know it's illustrated by a girl.
00:14:37 Uh, no.
00:14:38 And, and she refuses.
00:14:40 She absolutely refuses to draw anything that does not have giant boobs.
00:14:46 Can you introduce me?
00:14:48 I can.
00:14:50 I'll send you a link afterwards.
00:14:52 So her name is, her name is Ushimi and she, uh, I have offered her to attempt to draw
00:14:59 a girl with a slightly less gigantic boobs.
00:15:03 Uh, and she has refused.
00:15:05 So yes.
00:15:06 If you, if I will, I will actually send her, I will, I will message her and I will say
00:15:13 I'm a big fan of your.
00:15:14 I think you should.
00:15:15 I think that will make her very happy.
00:15:17 I will.
00:15:18 Absolutely.
00:15:19 100%.
00:15:20 Nothing would, nothing would make me.
00:15:21 It's funny.
00:15:22 Everyone thinks I'm the one asking for those characters to have gigantic boobs, but no.
00:15:26 In fact, I would prefer it if they didn't, every single one of them have gigantic boobs.
00:15:31 But, uh, yeah, every character that is not, that does not have giant boobs in that series
00:15:35 is drawn by the second artist we have on that series.
00:15:39 You're kidding.
00:15:40 I'm not even kidding.
00:15:41 No, she's, she's that serious about it.
00:15:43 She does not do the backgrounds.
00:15:44 She does not do the male characters.
00:15:45 She does not do anything that is not a giant titted female.
00:15:49 I respect the dedication to the craft.
00:15:53 Yeah.
00:15:54 Perfect.
00:15:55 Real goals right there.
00:15:56 Nobody else.
00:15:57 Nobody else fucking.
00:15:58 No, no, no, I'm going to do it.
00:15:59 Nobody else fucking talks to you.
00:16:03 Yeah.
00:16:04 Um, actually I remember that lecture you did on the girl, the girl who did the, uh, the
00:16:12 coconut wish girl.
00:16:13 What, what was her name again?
00:16:15 Yeah.
00:16:16 Yeah.
00:16:17 Jennifer Diane right.
00:16:18 Yeah.
00:16:19 She's fantastic.
00:16:20 I had no idea about any of the things.
00:16:21 All I'd ever seen of us was that one coconut wish comic.
00:16:24 Um, yeah.
00:16:25 Yeah.
00:16:26 And introduced me to this whole world.
00:16:28 I had no clue about.
00:16:29 I was so amazed.
00:16:30 Honestly.
00:16:31 So I left a comment on that video.
00:16:33 I said, why?
00:16:34 Mm hmm.
00:16:35 I was so amazed.
00:16:36 I was so flabbergasted.
00:16:37 Honestly.
00:16:38 How?
00:16:39 Uh huh.
00:16:40 I, I said in my comment, very specifically, why is the coconut wish girl better at writing
00:16:45 webcomics than me?
00:16:47 And I've been doing it for like nine years now.
00:16:49 And all of your viewers completely just dog piled me because you saw your awful, maybe
00:16:58 try putting some effort in, maybe you'll beat her then.
00:17:02 Oh, was it, was it that bad?
00:17:05 Wait, let me, let's, let's find, let's find, I deleted the comment though.
00:17:10 You did.
00:17:11 I kept, I kept getting, I kept getting replies.
00:17:13 They kept being like in my notifications for months later.
00:17:18 No.
00:17:19 What the fuck?
00:17:20 It was so amazing.
00:17:21 They just all owned me.
00:17:23 They kept doing it.
00:17:27 Your view is just, just like ganged up on me and bullied me too.
00:17:33 It was amazing.
00:17:34 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:17:35 No, I, I, I, I see, I see the comment.
00:17:38 Oh, I didn't delete it.
00:17:39 I see, let's, no, I'm, I'm glad though.
00:17:42 I might have just.
00:17:43 What was the one?
00:17:44 I talked myself out of believing it.
00:17:46 The one that I said I thought was the funniest was, oh wait, you, you were, you were too afraid
00:17:53 to go on.
00:17:54 That's, that's the difference between you and JDR is that JDR goes all in and you, you
00:17:59 just, you just lacked the, the, the, the moral fiber.
00:18:02 Yeah, I really am.
00:18:07 Apparently.
00:18:08 It's so difficult writing such a robust world building thing.
00:18:12 You know, I've tried so many times and I just frazzled my brain trying to come up with everything.
00:18:18 Yeah.
00:18:19 I, I was thinking about, I was, I was thinking about, I was thinking about that.
00:18:25 I was thinking about like, man, building like a big like comic.
00:18:28 I was thinking about the champion specifically.
00:18:30 I was like, man, expanding on that world is like any idea that I have for that just seems
00:18:34 like stupid.
00:18:35 It just seems like, what's even the point of doing that?
00:18:37 Like why even bother making a comic, building a world, creating fiction?
00:18:41 It's so lame.
00:18:42 But then I was like, you know what, actually, you know what?
00:18:45 It's, isn't it actually about, isn't it actually about the characters?
00:18:48 Like if I focus on that, I don't feel that cringy about it.
00:18:52 I don't feel that like intimidated like, oh, how would I even begin to like create a setting
00:18:58 that is not stupid?
00:19:00 The best things usually have a robust world that the characters like use to their advantage
00:19:07 in telling the story that they're about.
00:19:09 Like the, the interestingness of the world is useful in the story that the character is
00:19:16 in, you know what I mean?
00:19:18 I feel like if you, if you have a character and a white void, they're not going to have
00:19:22 much to do.
00:19:23 I feel like, like she actually took the hard route with all of it, with all of her world
00:19:28 building.
00:19:29 Because when you look at the world, like when you look at the, see, based on your lecture,
00:19:34 I haven't actually gotten around to reading the webcomic yet, although I really want to.
00:19:39 Based on what you were telling me, the interesting part was, in fact, not the characters.
00:19:44 It was the world they were in.
00:19:46 Oh yeah.
00:19:47 And that takes a lot of skill to do.
00:19:50 Like usually it's the other way around.
00:19:53 I think that she was a lot more interested in Bill.
00:19:57 And I'm sure she likes the characters, especially like, you know, a couple of standouts.
00:20:02 Yes.
00:20:03 But I think she's much more interested in the, in thinking of, thinking about universe,
00:20:09 parallel universes and like timelines and like, ooh, how does, how did, what an alternate
00:20:14 physics work?
00:20:15 Like that, I think that's what fascinates her.
00:20:18 Yeah.
00:20:19 On this, on, on that subject though, I did something this week or maybe it was last week,
00:20:24 I don't know.
00:20:25 A little wacky, a little weird, a little crazy.
00:20:28 Well, I went and I read one of her, a, a film fiction, her My Little Pony fan fiction.
00:20:35 Oh my God.
00:20:36 Yeah.
00:20:37 She has, I'm looking at her, her biography, Chatoyance on a, a film fiction.
00:20:44 She has written a total of 1.4 million words.
00:20:48 Whoa.
00:20:49 I guess that's a lot.
00:20:52 And they are set in, they're set in a whole bunch of, I think I explained this a little
00:20:56 bit in the lecture that like, her, her pony stories are all set in these like, kind of
00:21:03 like sub universes of film fiction.
00:21:06 You know what I mean?
00:21:07 Right.
00:21:08 These, these like fan, these fan like, constructions wherein like, oh, this is like a, an AU.
00:21:14 Yeah.
00:21:15 An AU.
00:21:16 An AU.
00:21:17 So she did a Marvel film?
00:21:18 She, she didn't start these like, like the, the big one is conversion bureau conversion
00:21:25 bureau is an AU in which basically equestria has appeared in the real world as like a magical
00:21:32 bubble that is expanding and humans and it is going to take over the entire world.
00:21:39 Humans cannot enter the bubble into equestria.
00:21:42 So in order for them not to be, you know, killed, destroyed by this, they have to become
00:21:48 converted into ponies.
00:21:50 So they, yeah, they have to undergo punification in order to, you know, to enter into this,
00:21:57 this.
00:21:58 Yeah.
00:21:59 So I read the first, I read the first story she ever posted on film fiction.
00:22:04 It was called the big, the big respawn and it's okay.
00:22:12 It's kind of short, actually.
00:22:14 It's, it's, it's fine.
00:22:15 Sounds like another lecture.
00:22:18 I had that idea.
00:22:19 I was like, what if I just did a whole thing about my little pony fan fiction?
00:22:25 Film fiction.net.
00:22:26 I think I could do one specifically on the conversion bureau.
00:22:30 I mean, there's so much, you know, I've watched, I've watched all of your lectures like six
00:22:34 times minimum.
00:22:36 Yeah, I've rewatched, I've rewatched them a bunch, especially the, especially the first
00:22:45 one.
00:22:47 But the second one.
00:22:47 I think my favorite one must be, yeah, Tails gets trolled.
00:22:53 Really?
00:22:54 Yes.
00:22:55 Most.
00:22:56 That one has a lot of like, whoa, from the audience, although the first one has that
00:23:02 as well.
00:23:03 Yeah.
00:23:04 I'm noticing.
00:23:05 I haven't watched the first one in a while, actually.
00:23:07 I'm noticing just now the Kokura Wish Lecture just passed a hundred thousand views.
00:23:12 It's pretty.
00:23:13 Wow.
00:23:14 It's pretty cool.
00:23:16 Oh, wait, I completely forgot about that one.
00:23:17 Yeah, that one's really good too.
00:23:20 Kokura, yeah.
00:23:21 We're just talking about it.
00:23:22 How did I forget you did a lecture on it?
00:23:24 It's weird.
00:23:29 Yeah, the Tails gets trolled when it's like, did you, do you know Cybershell?
00:23:34 No.
00:23:35 Do you know who that is?
00:23:36 Okay, he's a YouTuber, he's a Sonic YouTuber who was gone for a couple years and he just
00:23:43 made a big comeback on YouTube, he just posted a whole bunch of videos, and in one of them
00:23:47 he talks about Tails gets trolled, and in that video he mentions my lecture, but he
00:23:54 says, even this is a good video and it's a good lecture, but if you're going to read
00:23:59 Tails gets trolled, don't watch it, because it basically is just recounting the story.
00:24:05 And it's true.
00:24:06 The pleasure of the Tails gets trolled lecture is just that listening to it, you hear about
00:24:13 the story of Tails gets trolled, which is from cool and funny and amazing in its own
00:24:18 place.
00:24:19 It's the revelation of such a story that when you tell somebody in a sentence, that's the
00:24:25 dumbest thing I've ever heard.
00:24:27 But then when you go into more detail, you're like, oh my god, this is incredible.
00:24:31 I really liked your lecture because it feels like I get put into the mind of a person discovering,
00:24:39 more like the mind of a community discovering this thing that happened way back that I would
00:24:45 not be able to go into with a fresh mind anymore.
00:24:48 Mm-hmm.
00:24:49 Yeah.
00:24:50 It's, I wish, I wish I could read Tails gets trolled for the first time again.
00:25:00 I wish I could read, I guess I feel that way about a lot of things.
00:25:03 You know, actually, he did just start making pages again.
00:25:11 There is like, yeah, we talked about this with Cybershell, but the series ended on a
00:25:17 cliffhanger and then he tried, he decided he was going to go back and remake the entire
00:25:23 series and everyone was like, no, please, please don't do that, please just continue.
00:25:29 And then I guess he was gone for a while, but he has, yeah, laser bought the author.
00:25:34 He got a bunch of like artists, a bunch of like volunteer artists, like agreed to like
00:25:40 draw the rest of that chapter for him.
00:25:43 So the cliffhanger has been resolved.
00:25:45 And now I think he is like supposedly back to posting what I think is, no, it's not like
00:25:52 everyone, it seems like the story was almost over, but according to Cybershell and according
00:25:57 to, I know the guy who runs the website, the talesgetstroll.org website and runs the
00:26:05 Twitter account and does like all the promotion for it now.
00:26:09 He says that apparently laser bought says the story is only like half done or something.
00:26:13 So he did a one piece of web comics over here.
00:26:20 It's going to go on, it's going to last, it's going to outlive all of us fucking, yeah.
00:26:27 So you said he wanted to redo the entire story.
00:26:30 Yes.
00:26:31 I didn't know this, but apparently he started the story, it was called talesgetstroll polished.
00:26:40 And it was just like the story again, but with like more stuff, like more like just
00:26:49 like a longer way of telling it and like it was supposed to be have like a better art
00:26:55 style, but laser bought's not that good at art.
00:26:59 So it just kind of like and looked muddy, he tried to shade it, he tried to shade it,
00:27:06 but it just kind of ended up looking like sort of muddy, it wasn't, it wasn't helping.
00:27:11 I'm glad he didn't redo it.
00:27:14 Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
00:27:17 no, no, it's just kind of entertaining.
00:27:18 It's kind of funny actually because generally webcomic artists.
00:27:24 It gets I'm sure you know about this too, Ben.
00:27:27 It gets very tempting to like redo the first few chapters.
00:27:32 You know, I have never really had that problem.
00:27:39 But I know, I know it's common so good.
00:27:41 It's so perfect every time.
00:27:43 No, it's not.
00:27:44 It's not that it's not that.
00:27:46 I think I just, I think I had seen other artists try that kind of thing and I knew, I always
00:27:57 knew that that's an artist trap that you can fall into.
00:28:01 And I feel like when I look back at my old stuff it's like, I can't remake it, it would
00:28:10 just be a new thing if I tried, I don't know, I never have that urge, I mean I do look back
00:28:16 at my old stuff and I cringe and I think, wow this sucks, but I don't think like, oh
00:28:21 I should do it again and make it good this time, it was like, no, I can't, it's too late,
00:28:27 it sucks forever.
00:28:28 Something I did, which is on one of my comics that I wrote, it's probably the comic I have
00:28:35 with the most subscribers, it's called Winter Moon, it's got 2.5 million subs, which is a
00:28:40 lot for a comic.
00:28:43 So with that one, I actually really didn't like the first 100 episodes because they
00:28:53 were all, the artist was not very familiar with typesetting and also it was before I
00:29:00 had like fully an idea of what was going to happen, I was just like making things up
00:29:04 as I was going along, so lines of dialogue in that story will appear that reference
00:29:12 potential future villains that never ever appear.
00:29:17 So there's like one, one episode that I always think back to when I think about this, which
00:29:23 is like, the main character is like sitting and chilling and then these two guys just
00:29:28 pop out of nowhere to attack him and they have this like long bubble of dialogue that's
00:29:34 like way too long and they just go, because I only had four parents to work with, but
00:29:39 I had to like get some sort of foreshadowing in because I thought I was going to do this
00:29:43 like one story arc about how it takes place in an MMO and the idea is that the main characters
00:29:50 hated by all the big guild masters because of something he did, which never ended up
00:29:55 happening.
00:29:58 And so the dialogue of these two guys was just like, they just jump out of nowhere and
00:30:03 they go like, haha, we're going to kill you because the main guild masters union all hate
00:30:09 you and they're going to pay us to do it and this never gets brought up again and like
00:30:17 three seasons later, we never hear about this.
00:30:21 So I just hated that episode so very badly and all of the early episodes, they have this
00:30:26 problem with the typesetting and like the way you typeset things is really important.
00:30:32 I only learned this later and all of the dialogue is like very weirdly phrased.
00:30:36 So what I did instead of us like going back and redrawing all of it, I just hired two
00:30:43 professional typesetters to like just re-typeset the first 150 episodes and I feel way better
00:30:48 about it now.
00:30:49 That's like, yeah, it's the same, but just like with the jank sort of smooth, I guess.
00:30:58 Yeah, and the rewritten dialogue and stuff.
00:31:01 Yeah.
00:31:03 I mean, I think that like, I think probably there's a lot of like long form works of art
00:31:09 that probably start on like a totally, they say, you know, they have all these loose threads
00:31:15 at the beginning and then it kind of has to like find its footing and like figure out
00:31:19 what it actually wants to be as it goes along.
00:31:21 I mean, the thing that jumps to mind is like Seribus, Tom, you know what I'm talking about.
00:31:26 Yeah.
00:31:27 Seribus, like, you know, it starts out as like a fantasy.
00:31:31 It's like a parody of like Conan the Barbarian and then at some point along the way he starts
00:31:37 going to these alternate realities and it's like.
00:31:40 It becomes a very different thing.
00:31:42 It's like Dave Sim was just like, eh, I kind of don't want to do a fantasy parody anymore.
00:31:46 I kind of just want to talk about like what I think about politics.
00:31:50 Real shit.
00:31:51 Yeah, what I think about how like, you know, how like women suck and stuff.
00:31:55 The first like arc of the story after this parodies is like high society.
00:31:59 It's all about classism.
00:32:00 And then the second arc is church and state, which is all about commenting on theocracy.
00:32:04 It's like, this started as a Conan parody.
00:32:06 What is happening?
00:32:07 This is all like through the character of like an anthropomorphic art bark and it's very,
00:32:12 it's like tonal whiplash, but like that's when the comic really gets interesting.
00:32:15 Oh, you know, I was, I was going to say Seribus lecture, but I've seen, I have watched at least
00:32:24 one YouTube video that basically just summarizes the story of Seribus.
00:32:29 So it wouldn't be beaten to the punch, I guess.
00:32:34 Ben, if I ever become schizophrenic, please promise me one thing.
00:32:38 Yes.
00:32:39 Anything.
00:32:40 Make a lecture about me.
00:32:42 Oh, like if you just go off the rails and start like putting out like really wacky shit.
00:32:47 If I, if I let go of the rails, become insane, start doing all of this weird stuff.
00:32:53 Everyone starts hating me.
00:32:55 Well, now make a lecture and make me seem so very pleased.
00:32:57 This Mary guy, like he's such a fucking train wreck.
00:33:00 Like, oh, I hate this guy so much, but why, but why is he such a fucking idiot?
00:33:05 And I'll say, aha.
00:33:06 And then you do it.
00:33:07 I know.
00:33:08 Now that you've said, now that you've said that though, how are we ever going to know
00:33:10 if it's a legit breakdown or if you're just trying to bait Ben into making a lecture about
00:33:14 me?
00:33:15 You'll never know.
00:33:16 I guess you'll never know.
00:33:18 You can always go back to this and play it and add to the mystery of that.
00:33:23 Is he just pretending?
00:33:25 Did you, did you see, did you, you seen Tom's Animorph lecture?
00:33:31 Not yet.
00:33:32 No, that's, I actually, I didn't know you guys had new lectures.
00:33:35 Yeah.
00:33:36 They came out.
00:33:37 They could be getting an April.
00:33:38 Yeah.
00:33:39 Yeah.
00:33:40 We recorded all of them in like March and yeah, that one came out in like April.
00:33:42 That one's pretty good.
00:33:43 I would say Animorph's one is pretty highly regarded, which I'm surprised that.
00:33:47 I see it's, it's a 200.
00:33:49 It's a good, it's a good big talk about and a very strange thing.
00:33:56 I think you would like it.
00:33:57 Yeah.
00:33:58 Mary.
00:33:59 Um, it's, um, it's been, uh, I think I was looking at the analytics and I think it's
00:34:04 been the biggest, uh, I think it's been the biggest, uh, ad rev earner on the channel
00:34:10 for, uh, for a while, which, uh, did pretty well.
00:34:14 That reminds me of, this is a funny, funny anecdote from this week, um, some, some one
00:34:20 on Twitter who I don't know made a joke about like podcasts with too many people on them
00:34:25 and, uh, and, uh, Bev, who I know, an RFCK person and who was on the, the 40 person,
00:34:32 you know, all guest podcasts, tweeted a reply like I was on a podcast with 40 people Lamau.
00:34:39 And I guess maybe this person retweeted it and it got like, uh, I don't know, it got
00:34:42 a few thousand like views from this.
00:34:45 And I was, yeah, it made, it made about like, it made like $10 in ad rev.
00:34:51 Sick.
00:34:52 Yeah.
00:34:53 It was like, fuck yeah.
00:34:54 Cool.
00:34:55 What's the animal flexor up to?
00:34:56 It made like a couple hundred dollars last time I checked, right?
00:34:58 Uh, you know, I mean, I can, I'm not logged in, but let me, let me log in and we can,
00:35:02 uh, uh, I don't know if I care that much to get to log in and it's unbelievable.
00:35:08 Logging is just such a hassle.
00:35:10 Wait, what?
00:35:11 It totally is.
00:35:12 What are we talking about?
00:35:13 Uh, stuff.
00:35:14 Okay.
00:35:15 Comics.
00:35:16 Nice.
00:35:17 Nice.
00:35:18 Uh, YouTube.
00:35:19 Like with, with the thing with, with, with, uh, cause I've been making comics for a little
00:35:24 while now and I am.
00:35:26 Oh, you do?
00:35:27 I do.
00:35:28 I do.
00:35:29 Uh.
00:35:30 Give makes.
00:35:31 Uh, yeah.
00:35:32 Give makes comics.
00:35:33 That's true.
00:35:34 Let me get an image.
00:35:35 Sad but true.
00:35:36 The most recent one shot that I submitted to the Tezuka award, um, contest thing.
00:35:43 Oh yeah.
00:35:44 When do you find out?
00:35:45 Do you read that?
00:35:46 When do you find out about that?
00:35:47 I, I just checked today.
00:35:48 It still isn't closed yet.
00:35:49 They're still, no, it's, it's closed, but they're judging it and I've been judging it
00:35:53 for a while.
00:35:54 Um, let me get a good page for all the pages.
00:35:58 Um, but yeah, I've been doing comics for a little while and I'm like in my head, there's
00:36:04 like so many over, like over the top ridiculous big stories that I could tell with all these
00:36:10 characters that I have.
00:36:12 And I'm like, I got to get started somewhere.
00:36:14 I'll make a short, small story and then, uh, eventually I'll, I'll foreshadow everything.
00:36:20 Everything that I say will become something later.
00:36:22 It'll all be so fucking based and so cool and people will go back and be like, oh my
00:36:26 God, it's like Oda is just, it's just genius.
00:36:29 Um, but I don't, I feel like it's not going to happen like that.
00:36:33 I think it's just going to be a little fun thing and then I'll actually start being good
00:36:37 later.
00:36:38 I can't find a good image.
00:36:40 Every attempt at like making a comic that I've tried to do has always collapsed under
00:36:44 the world building weight because I'm so obsessed with like crazy high concept fantasy stories,
00:36:50 which is why with the character I'm doing now as Umi, it's just like, there's no story.
00:36:54 The story is she does something cool and, uh, it's takes a lot of pressure off and kind
00:37:01 of allows me to be more freeform with the stuff I end up making and, uh, I like it.
00:37:05 It works for me.
00:37:06 I'm not a craze.
00:37:07 I'm not George R. R. Martin.
00:37:09 I'm, uh, Michael Bay, I guess, and I just have to own that at some point.
00:37:14 You just have to accept Michael Bay, you just have to let go and embrace what you've become
00:37:21 based Adam Jensen.
00:37:22 These are some things, the Clarissa gun smoke and the bandit king as I submitted it to the
00:37:31 Tezuka thing.
00:37:32 Are you putting it in discord?
00:37:33 Yeah, I put it in the general chat.
00:37:35 Right.
00:37:36 Oh, that's like a shit.
00:37:38 You know, I have that panel is so good.
00:37:40 I haven't actually gotten around to reading it yet.
00:37:43 It's it's it's not fully out yet.
00:37:45 I still need to do the second half and then I'm going to put it on my site.
00:37:50 Right.
00:37:51 That that's why that's why I was waiting for him.
00:37:53 Yeah.
00:37:54 I'm so I'm so I'm so you know what this reminds me of?
00:38:00 Yeah.
00:38:01 What?
00:38:02 It reminds me of you guys have seen Giorgio's bizarre adventure.
00:38:05 I've heard of such a.
00:38:06 Yeah.
00:38:07 A bit.
00:38:08 So there's these characters in Giorgio's bizarre adventure.
00:38:10 They have a they have a stand that can allow them to see the future, but it's drawn in a
00:38:16 bizarrely illustrated manga and they're called Oingo Boingo.
00:38:21 One of them is called Oingo.
00:38:22 The other is called Boingo and and and this art style kind of reminds me of them.
00:38:27 Boingo Boingo.
00:38:29 I'm not familiar.
00:38:30 Oh, wait, I wait.
00:38:35 Oh, well, I can't.
00:38:37 I can't post anything.
00:38:38 I can't post anything.
00:38:40 Oh, no, I just realized I'm going to have to.
00:38:45 I'm going to have to I'm going to have to fuck with the V with the VTuber recording
00:38:48 in order to post the voicemail links later, but that's OK.
00:38:52 That's fine.
00:38:53 It'll it'll it'll be fine.
00:38:56 Oingo Boingo looks yikes.
00:38:59 Yeah, you should you should you should Google it.
00:39:01 Yeah, it's it's odd.
00:39:02 It looks a little bit like more grats.
00:39:05 Oh, God. Yeah.
00:39:07 Is that little like sun thing floating under the brother's adventure?
00:39:11 Is that like is that the sweet bro and hella Jeff?
00:39:18 The turn. Wait, what?
00:39:19 It's sweet bro.
00:39:21 Well, you see when I when I Google Oingo Boingo, I see the purple book cover.
00:39:26 And there's like a little like
00:39:28 flower sun thing.
00:39:29 I don't know, it's got like a sweet bro and hella Jeff mouth.
00:39:32 I've got the Oingo Boingo band that is based off.
00:39:35 No, wrong.
00:39:39 False. OK.
00:39:42 Do you guys want to know?
00:39:45 Do you do you want to know?
00:39:46 Should I make it public information?
00:39:47 How much money?
00:39:49 How much ad revenue all of our all of our top videos have made?
00:39:53 I'm looking. Yeah, why not?
00:39:55 It makes us sound like we're established and cool.
00:39:58 I'm I'm looking at the data right now.
00:40:00 This is this is interesting.
00:40:01 I'm some of these surprised me a little bit.
00:40:05 Number one, Animorphs 101
00:40:08 has made in its lifetime eight hundred and seventy dollars.
00:40:13 Damn.
00:40:13 Hottest goss in the universe has made eight hundred and twenty four dollars.
00:40:18 Guilty Gear 101.
00:40:20 Seven hundred and sixty two dollars.
00:40:22 I'm bringing in all the big bucks, baby.
00:40:25 Deagle Nation, five hundred and nine dollars.
00:40:29 Voice Bale Fund, four hundred and eleven dollars.
00:40:31 But that doesn't count.
00:40:32 That's not ad revenue.
00:40:33 That was donations.
00:40:35 And then OK, then the next one was Radcon for Paradise Opening Ceremony.
00:40:38 That was donations again.
00:40:40 After that, it's Things We Can't Get Into, which has made two hundred and forty seven dollars.
00:40:45 And then Sonichu 360 classroom has made two hundred and forty six.
00:40:51 And then it's a whole bunch of bullshit after that.
00:40:54 That's those are the interesting ones.
00:40:56 So now join them.
00:40:57 So now you know, what's that?
00:41:00 Can I join? Can you join?
00:41:02 What? Oh, you want to flex on us with your crazy numbers?
00:41:06 Oh, yeah, please. Yeah. Yeah.
00:41:08 I love data. The funny thing is I actually think you guys have made
00:41:12 like your individual videos have made more than mine.
00:41:14 Wait, really? How's that?
00:41:16 How does it even work? I would I would believe it because my videos are less.
00:41:19 Most of my videos are less than ten minutes.
00:41:22 That's true. Multiple ad breaks.
00:41:24 You you think? Yeah.
00:41:26 You upload a lot of the highest.
00:41:28 They're like, well, then would you call them motion comics?
00:41:32 Yeah, motion comics.
00:41:34 I I had a theory a while ago that you could basically get.
00:41:40 Seventy percent of the way to the feel of getting an anime.
00:41:44 If you look like without any animation,
00:41:47 if you just get Japanese voice actors and custom music, I think you are a hundred
00:41:51 percent correct in that in that apparently it works.
00:41:55 Estimated. Yeah.
00:41:57 Um, I think people I think people
00:42:01 people overvalue polish and like in the same way.
00:42:06 This was laser bots. Great failing.
00:42:07 This is why he wanted to make tails get strolled polished because he was like,
00:42:10 oh, I got to make it perfect.
00:42:12 I got to make it high quality.
00:42:14 I got to have like high fidelity renderings.
00:42:16 I have to render every individual bit of stubble on the Space Marine's cheek.
00:42:21 You know, in my triple a video game and it's all it's all bullshit.
00:42:25 No, I'm even now that I'm looking at my my Clarissa drawings here.
00:42:29 I'm like, God, this was so bad.
00:42:32 It needs to be redone, but of course it doesn't.
00:42:35 It's fine. It'll do. It's cool.
00:42:37 I I look at I look at like my worst.
00:42:39 I look at my worst panels in like
00:42:42 slime and punishment, which like some of them are just straight up bad
00:42:46 because like I would crank them out in like five minutes sometimes.
00:42:49 And I look at the really bad ones and I'm just like, well, that's funny.
00:42:52 I like it.
00:42:55 I don't know. I don't know.
00:42:56 Well, when you when you rush something or like you just do it real quick
00:43:01 and it comes out sloppy, that's understandable and thus OK.
00:43:04 And you can be like, how low when you try really hard.
00:43:08 And then it turns out that you're, you know, your best is lame.
00:43:13 And it's like, oh, it feels it hurts a little more.
00:43:17 I guess.
00:43:18 Yeah, I guess so.
00:43:20 I guess it's easy to look at that because I know, like, yeah,
00:43:24 I slapped this out in like five minutes. Don't worry about it.
00:43:27 Hmm. Hmm.
00:43:30 I think my biggest earning video was a Minecraft anime one.
00:43:34 Was it the the the Creeper girl?
00:43:37 Yeah. Yeah.
00:43:38 And I looked at your channel the other day and just to see, like,
00:43:42 you know, what you had on there.
00:43:43 And I think that one was like it's got like it's got millions of views, right?
00:43:47 Must. Yeah. Yeah.
00:43:50 I think the biggest one we've got is two point two million views.
00:43:53 Yeah.
00:43:54 But even that one, they don't really make that much money.
00:43:56 I think, like, yeah, it's about watch time.
00:44:00 Yeah. Watch time and average.
00:44:02 Most of my videos don't really go above a few hundred dollars.
00:44:05 Yeah. Wow. Yeah.
00:44:08 Do you?
00:44:09 Well, that really is terrible.
00:44:10 Like, I've heard the way that the YouTube
00:44:14 changed to watch time, destroyed animation on YouTube forever.
00:44:17 And it never really recovered.
00:44:20 And the idea that you can do one thing that kind of saves us
00:44:22 is that we don't do animation. Yeah.
00:44:24 It's like multiple millions of views
00:44:28 and you can't get more than the sort of stuff we make.
00:44:30 The lectures are obviously like good quality content,
00:44:34 but their length like both like we've only got a few.
00:44:38 Well, actually, how many how many views is the top viewed thing on our
00:44:42 Scott? The top viewed.
00:44:45 Yeah. What's the view?
00:44:46 Most of our most viewed video is.
00:44:52 It's the guilty gear lecture with almost just shy of 300 K.
00:44:57 Really? Yeah.
00:44:58 And then the second one is the animorphs with two point 15 K.
00:45:03 Then I thought it would be the.
00:45:07 The son of two lecture or something.
00:45:09 That's not that's not that's not my channel.
00:45:11 That's on a different channel.
00:45:12 So that's actually.
00:45:14 And I mean, Nate's lectures, Nate's one piece lecture,
00:45:17 I think has half a million and the the Kingdom Hearts lecture.
00:45:22 I'm not sure if that's hit a million, but it's got a lot.
00:45:25 I really like the Deagle Nation one.
00:45:28 I, you know, I had I remember being there in hearing it live.
00:45:34 And it was a ton of fun.
00:45:36 I don't know if I've gone back and rewatched it.
00:45:39 But maybe I should.
00:45:43 I've rewatched a bunch of the other ones.
00:45:45 One time in Japan, I decided to.
00:45:49 So this is this is a PCP lecture story from me about one of the one
00:45:55 of one of the ways I used one of your lectures to get through some work.
00:45:58 OK. So in Japan, I don't know if you guys know this,
00:46:02 but they have a very strict recycling thing.
00:46:04 You have to get like these colored bags and put everything in the exact right
00:46:08 thing. And if you don't do it right, you get this like pink slip of shame
00:46:12 that they put on your thing and say that they're going to refuse taking your trash.
00:46:17 So one time I had to reorganize all of my trash like five days after I put it there.
00:46:22 Yeah.
00:46:25 And I had to do it all on my tiny balcony.
00:46:28 So I put on the Deagle Nation lecture and I did it then.
00:46:33 Well, you're rifling through trash.
00:46:36 Yeah. Yeah.
00:46:38 It's pretty comfy.
00:46:40 Good. That's that's good.
00:46:42 That's what it's for. You. Yeah.
00:46:44 Do you still live in Japan?
00:46:46 No, I I I usually do.
00:46:49 But the problem is the coronavirus pandemic hit.
00:46:53 And then I got afraid because I was it was back in back in like February
00:46:57 when it really got crazy. Yeah.
00:47:00 I I.
00:47:02 I I got I got scared because Japan's close to China.
00:47:06 And back then we didn't really know much about what the coronavirus like truly was.
00:47:11 All we did was like we heard like news from Wuhan about how they were
00:47:18 were like forcefully closing apartments down and stuff.
00:47:22 And and we had no clue if they were even reporting the right numbers and stuff.
00:47:26 So I got scared.
00:47:27 So I went back to Denmark.
00:47:29 Yeah.
00:47:29 And like stayed with my mom for a bit.
00:47:33 And unfortunately,
00:47:37 the borders closed like a week or two after.
00:47:40 And then I was stuck and I've been stuck here since.
00:47:42 And the thing is, it's not even much better here.
00:47:45 I was I don't even have much better numbers in Japan.
00:47:47 Yeah, I was going to say like, I don't know exactly how the numbers are.
00:47:50 I know like Vietnam and like South Korea, I think, are doing really well
00:47:56 with coronavirus America not doing so great.
00:48:00 Europe overall doing pretty bad right now.
00:48:02 I don't know how I don't have Denmark and Japan are doing in the grand scheme of things.
00:48:07 I would. Well, Japan Japan has pretty good set up for the entire thing.
00:48:12 Because they have they are all used to using masks already and used to like washing
00:48:17 their hands and not touching too many things in public.
00:48:20 Yeah. Yeah.
00:48:21 So they were good from the outset.
00:48:24 This is the first time I've ever seen people using masks in Denmark.
00:48:28 Oh, yeah. Same.
00:48:30 Same over here in Massachusetts.
00:48:35 It's pretty cool, honestly.
00:48:36 It's pretty pumped. I was so upset.
00:48:37 I was meant to go to America this year and do conventions.
00:48:41 Oh, my God.
00:48:42 Yeah, I'm I'm sure all the convention circuits are closed this year, right?
00:48:46 Yeah, every every convention.
00:48:47 I mean, like me and me and like Saber and Paylor.
00:48:50 And then we all used to go to conventions like MomoCon and stuff.
00:48:53 And every year since they started going to MomoCon, I've missed it for some reason.
00:48:56 And this year I finally could.
00:48:57 And of course, MomoCon is canceled along with every other convention.
00:49:00 I was going to be I was going to be like a VIP guest at so many different
00:49:04 conventions this year, and all of them got canceled.
00:49:07 Yeah. The one year I was some of them canceled next year as well.
00:49:10 Already, it's fucking crazy.
00:49:12 It was my first year going to conventions.
00:49:17 It's it always sucks like hearing that.
00:49:19 Oh, I was I was waiting.
00:49:21 And this was the year I was going to do a whole bunch of stuff.
00:49:23 It's the new decade.
00:49:25 No. No, I I kept I kept, you know, yeah, I kept saying like,
00:49:32 I'm going to I'm going to start tabling at conventions.
00:49:35 I meant to do it last year at Mice, the.
00:49:40 Oh, God, some Massachusetts indie comic expo.
00:49:43 I meant to do it last year, but I like was too late to sign up and I missed it.
00:49:47 So this year I went to it and I didn't table again.
00:49:50 I was like, no, fuck it.
00:49:51 Next year, I'm going to do it for real.
00:49:53 It's going to it's going to happen.
00:49:55 And then, yeah, no, not anymore.
00:49:57 There's no mice anymore.
00:50:00 Yeah, so same.
00:50:01 Yes, another like was my school because I wanted to go, but I never did
00:50:06 because I suck.
00:50:07 Honestly, no, I don't like it.
00:50:10 Damn, I don't I don't I don't like it as an attendee, but I wanted to table at it.
00:50:14 I think that would I would have felt differently about it.
00:50:17 Interesting. Yeah.
00:50:19 Because there's there's nothing there, except like you walk through a series
00:50:23 of hallways and rooms where people have tables and are selling stuff.
00:50:28 And I don't want and I don't want to buy shit.
00:50:29 It sounds like Mocha, which I went to once during college, which was pretty cool
00:50:33 because I met a bunch of people from a podcast I was listening to.
00:50:36 But yeah, it was just indie comics.
00:50:39 It's like, that's all it was, just a big room for the dude selling indie books.
00:50:43 You've just described why I decided to start doing comics.
00:50:46 What do you mean?
00:50:48 I went to the convention in Denmark and I had nothing to do.
00:50:52 And all of it was just walking through hallways.
00:50:54 All the things people did was either cosplay or selling things.
00:50:59 Yeah. I.
00:51:01 So that's when I decided back in 2012 that I wanted to write comics.
00:51:05 I when I yeah, at my side, I was like, I would be.
00:51:10 Like it's it sounds cool.
00:51:12 Like, oh, it's a gathering of all these.
00:51:14 Like it's like a lot of them are completely unknown.
00:51:17 A lot of them are have no like name, recognition.
00:51:20 There's some guy and or whatever.
00:51:22 And it would be cool to go and like meet those people.
00:51:26 But at mice, I didn't meet those people.
00:51:29 Like there's just like you go in front of their table
00:51:32 and you look at their shit and either you buy it or you don't.
00:51:35 And you just make, I don't know.
00:51:36 You might make a little small to I'm not interested in the in the buying shit.
00:51:41 I would like to meet other comics people, but it just I went to mice twice
00:51:45 and neither time, neither time did it scratch that edge for me.
00:51:48 Then here's a question because here's something I've been thinking about a lot,
00:51:51 like going to conventions and like why I never went to conventions until like 2013.
00:51:56 Do you think that being where we were in the pony thing
00:52:01 and going to pony conventions, like changed our perspective
00:52:04 on what a convention should be?
00:52:06 Because like every time I've gone to a con before
00:52:10 and after like being prominent in that community,
00:52:12 it feels like a very empty consumerist action.
00:52:15 Whereas when it was like the pony thing and I was like a known entity
00:52:20 in that small bubble, like it was a much more dynamic experience.
00:52:23 And I feel like that was what I really enjoyed about going to cons
00:52:27 and not just going and like talking to people and buying things.
00:52:31 I am going to say kind of.
00:52:34 But no, I think that I think I do think that, yeah, being being,
00:52:40 you know, even a little bit horse famous at a at a pony convention.
00:52:45 Yeah, like obviously that lent a certain energy to it.
00:52:49 And, you know, sort of propelled the experience, I guess, because like,
00:52:53 you know, you were always like we were like we were we were always
00:52:57 like making appearances and stuff like people were like people would see us
00:53:01 and they and it would like cause a minor, you know, stare or whatever.
00:53:04 It would be a little bit of an event wherever we went.
00:53:07 It was very exciting. It sounds nice.
00:53:08 It was it was pretty cool. It was pretty bad.
00:53:11 But like not to say I guess what I'm trying to say is that.
00:53:13 But my but my but I don't think that's entirely.
00:53:16 I think that Brony Khan specifically is like a specifically
00:53:21 like high energy event.
00:53:23 I guess I guess what I'm trying to say is I think it's a little calm.
00:53:26 A little bit like when you're saying like I want to go to convention
00:53:29 to meet people like because of like the the certain degree of clout
00:53:33 and that people knew who you were to a degree, it made approaching
00:53:36 and talking and meeting and interacting with people much easier.
00:53:40 Because like you again, you had like a reputation that preceded you.
00:53:42 Whereas like if I went to mice, I would feel like a fucking moron trying
00:53:45 to just go up and talk to somebody because like it's a much it's a cold
00:53:49 experience versus a warm interaction.
00:53:52 Yeah, definitely. I've tried both.
00:53:54 I went to I actually went to a convention like last month
00:53:59 in Germany. They did one convention, one test to see if it could be possible
00:54:03 during Corona virus. Oh my God.
00:54:05 I did test negative afterwards.
00:54:07 So that was pretty good.
00:54:08 It was pretty good. Congratulations.
00:54:09 The convention was a success.
00:54:12 It was very good.
00:54:13 I was I sold out of all my comics, which is amazing.
00:54:17 So many people compared to Copenhagen comics, where no one knew who I was.
00:54:22 You sell you sell like physical comics, too?
00:54:25 Yeah, only at conventions.
00:54:27 Oh, sure. Yeah.
00:54:29 So I met so I went to a convention
00:54:33 and they called Copenhagen comics another time that was like two years ago.
00:54:39 And I thought that I would it was probably one of the first time I really did
00:54:44 a convention. But the thing is, no one knew who I was because it was like a
00:54:49 traditional comic convention.
00:54:51 And they put me over in the corner with the like the youth corner.
00:54:55 Oh, this is the webcomic guy.
00:54:56 Yeah, just just put him over in the corner with all the kids, right?
00:55:00 And and front stage, I was probably
00:55:04 a follower wise.
00:55:05 I was probably the biggest one there if you're thinking like social media following.
00:55:09 But the front and center, they had one of the artists of Garfield.
00:55:13 And I was just put off all the way in the corner.
00:55:16 Oh, you can't you can't compete with that Garfield clout.
00:55:19 There's no touch in there.
00:55:23 And they also did the same thing to to another artist.
00:55:27 He's called Toshio Maida, and he's the guy who did La Blue Girl,
00:55:31 which is like a really old hentai.
00:55:33 Yeah, yeah.
00:55:34 He's the guy who like he's the guy who like popularized the whole tentacle thing
00:55:38 in Hentai. Yeah, well, that's doing work over there.
00:55:42 Yeah, well, he was really cool.
00:55:43 He told me about how I said hi to him.
00:55:47 And the first thing he told me because we had like one mutual friend,
00:55:50 which is Jacob, the CEO of Faku.
00:55:52 And the first thing he told me is that that guy's girlfriend is hot.
00:55:56 So that was pretty funny.
00:55:58 Just this old Japanese guy.
00:56:03 He's really cool. Yeah.
00:56:04 I yeah, I think that Tom, where you were saying, OK, about about like.
00:56:12 I don't expect to go to something and like have clout.
00:56:16 Like, obviously, yeah, if you go and you've got clout, that's good.
00:56:19 And people will respond in a way that's good.
00:56:22 And yeah, like, obviously, that's ideal.
00:56:24 I guess. But like, I think that's a little bit of the difference.
00:56:28 I think would be between like tabling at one of these and as an attendee.
00:56:33 Because as an attendee, you're just there.
00:56:34 You're you're a sheep, you know, you're there to consume.
00:56:38 If you're a tabler, I feel like if you're a tabling,
00:56:41 you would at least have. Oh, my God, someone.
00:56:44 Someone just someone just subscribed to the YouTube channel.
00:56:50 And it like made the like funny gift happen over Mary's face.
00:56:55 So that's that. Don't don't worry about it.
00:56:57 Don't worry about it, viewers.
00:56:59 It's it's good.
00:57:00 I'm glad it didn't make the sound.
00:57:02 But yeah, like if you're tabling, I feel like that's
00:57:06 that would be how you would like get to like
00:57:09 converse with your fellow creatives or whatever.
00:57:11 That's like gets you on the inside.
00:57:13 You're there with a purpose.
00:57:14 You show up early. You're setting up.
00:57:16 You're all like, you know, I don't know, making small talk with the people
00:57:20 tabling around you or whatever.
00:57:22 Maybe there's like a lounge or something. I don't fucking know.
00:57:25 I mean, I've I've gone to like one small convention
00:57:28 before I had any clout in the pony thing.
00:57:31 And I was trying to table there and I was trying to sell prints and stuff.
00:57:34 And it was miserable because nobody knew who I was.
00:57:36 Nobody wanted to talk to me.
00:57:37 I literally just sat there for two days, but just staring at a wall.
00:57:41 But surely surely you weren't the only person tabling who nobody knew, right?
00:57:46 Yeah, nobody. I don't think anybody there was like particularly like well known.
00:57:50 But like nobody wanted to talk to each other either.
00:57:52 It was just like you were just sitting there like waiting for death and it sucked.
00:57:56 Well, how does it? Yeah, I know that feel.
00:58:00 OK, it's all thanks for thanks for disillusioning me.
00:58:03 I just want to say my dream mice could very well end up that way as well.
00:58:08 Everyone just like kind of awkwardly hoping that someone
00:58:10 because like it's an awkward position where you have no clout
00:58:13 and like the little bubble you're in.
00:58:15 So you're just you're just there hoping like someone will come over
00:58:18 and they'll look at your stuff and they'll look at you and you'll be like,
00:58:22 what's going to happen? And then they just walk away.
00:58:24 And you're just like, well, OK, that was awkward.
00:58:26 And that was just that 48 hours was like, OK, cool.
00:58:31 Oh, I tried that in January.
00:58:33 I was at a Finnish convention and Finnish people are very a social.
00:58:37 So if you if you make icons, sounds like my kind of way and walk away.
00:58:42 I feel like if it was like like
00:58:45 if it was me, you and Gib, I went to mice together and had a table
00:58:49 like we could like vibe off of each other while trying to do things.
00:58:53 That would be a totally different experience.
00:58:54 Oh, it's like me by myself sitting at mice.
00:58:56 I love that. A big old cut.
00:58:58 Let's do it, buddy.
00:58:59 But next time America reopens, let's do it.
00:59:01 All right, we'll see you in 2037 when the virus is finally contained.
00:59:05 I was going to fuck.
00:59:06 Oh, that makes me sad, because I kind of had a plan to do that last time.
00:59:11 I was when I when I failed to sign up to table at mice, me and me and Kazi.
00:59:15 We're going to we said we were going to like table together.
00:59:17 And then I fucking blew it.
00:59:19 It didn't happen.
00:59:21 And now it'll never happen.
00:59:23 Did Kazi table by herself?
00:59:25 No, she didn't. I'm going.
00:59:26 No, she didn't either.
00:59:28 Nobody did. Yes.
00:59:30 It all came tumbling down.
00:59:32 God, I've got to I've got to finish some of my comics.
00:59:34 I've got to I've got to finish the Lord of Ghosts
00:59:37 so I can print it out and do something.
00:59:38 I want I want to finish a comic just so I can print it.
00:59:40 I just want comics on the shelf.
00:59:43 Yeah, I like be erect for months if I can make that happen.
00:59:46 Yeah, you know, hey, I think we should all do a booth together.
00:59:51 Yeah, that would be pretty cool.
00:59:52 That would be so sick. Yeah, please, please.
00:59:57 But did I have I talked about what a fucking nightmare
01:00:00 it was trying to peddle my comics in like stores?
01:00:04 Yeah, I think you have talked about it, but it's been a while.
01:00:07 I remember I remember during years ago during RFCK.
01:00:11 No, I'm retrieval con.
01:00:13 We walked around one of the shops where you had put in
01:00:17 like you had given the owner of the store
01:00:19 the vapors chapter one or something
01:00:21 and Munchie and everyone like conspired to like ask the guy
01:00:25 like one at a time like, hey, have you seen the Vapors by Ben St.
01:00:29 to just try and give him the idea to intercept the idea
01:00:32 that Ben St. is a big deal and that you should buy more comics from him.
01:00:36 You get this one guy to be like, hmm, who is this Ben St.
01:00:40 fellow? Yeah, the I don't know.
01:00:44 The thing about, man, I would go from store to store.
01:00:48 I would I would like look up like comic stores.
01:00:51 They sell comic books in in Boston.
01:00:53 OK, and I would go into the city and I'm OK.
01:00:55 I'm going to hit this place, hit this place, at this place.
01:00:58 And each time they'd be like, hmm, I don't know who you are.
01:01:01 But if you want to give me like three copies,
01:01:04 I'll give you like three dollars a piece for them.
01:01:07 And I was like, yes, but I'm legit now.
01:01:10 I'm published. I'm in stores, baby.
01:01:13 It was a giant waste of time.
01:01:15 I will never do it again.
01:01:17 The only the only way it's the only way it's worth it is if you have
01:01:22 a distributor who will like, you know, yeah, lobby these people for you,
01:01:26 put you in a fucking catalog or something.
01:01:28 There's like the rewards.
01:01:31 They're just not they're not willing to like
01:01:33 stock your comic in bulk if they don't know who you are.
01:01:35 And why would they?
01:01:36 And it's just not worth it's not worth the fucking
01:01:41 bus ticket to go into town and like, yeah,
01:01:45 sell like twelve dollars worth of shit.
01:01:48 Spend it on lunch and then come home in the red.
01:01:52 So it was a bit of a bug.
01:01:54 You know, I tried to do that with the comic store in my city.
01:01:58 Yeah. How to go?
01:02:00 They didn't know who I was and they just basically told me like,
01:02:04 maybe if you send us something in an email,
01:02:06 I tried to explain to them that I have the many subs,
01:02:10 but they did not really care.
01:02:12 And do you know who I am?
01:02:15 I mean, these kind of guys who run like comic book shops and stuff,
01:02:19 like their their brain is just like diamond numbers and that's it.
01:02:23 They don't give a shit about like the Internet.
01:02:25 So I mean, they're not going to understand the language we're talking.
01:02:28 They're no like incident.
01:02:30 They're in they're in the physical.
01:02:32 They're in the physical media business.
01:02:34 I imagine I mean, like I imagine that they are
01:02:39 right because like their sales in store are not going to be dependent on like
01:02:45 how well known someone is elsewhere or on the Internet.
01:02:48 I mean, there's going to be some people who come in looking for a specific thing.
01:02:52 And those are going to be either like the classics or they're going to be like some
01:02:57 something from like a new like up and comer, right?
01:02:59 And there's probably only so many of those in like a year.
01:03:02 And then other than that, their sales are just going to be
01:03:05 people that come in, don't know what they want
01:03:08 and see something that looks appealing on the shelf, right?
01:03:11 And they're just going to make like a I guess I'll buy that
01:03:14 because why not?
01:03:16 So, you know, that's like a whole like mindset.
01:03:20 That's like that I don't understand.
01:03:23 Imagine selling things in a store.
01:03:25 I don't it's so removed.
01:03:27 It's so removed from from what it's kind of antiquated with the Internet.
01:03:32 But like, you know, we just it's the digital market is still there, I guess.
01:03:36 I mean, if people are still making their living, I guess it's not the fuck.
01:03:40 If people if it still works, then it's the conclusion.
01:03:44 Yeah, boomers bad.
01:03:46 Yeah. Well, no, no, it's all bad new good.
01:03:51 What? What?
01:03:53 That's like the opposite of the marching orders of this podcast.
01:03:55 I'm going to disagree.
01:03:57 I'm going to I disagree.
01:03:58 I I think I I even though I don't do it,
01:04:03 I think that the idea of like a physical store is nice.
01:04:07 And, you know, I don't know.
01:04:10 There's surely there's a surely there's room.
01:04:12 There's room in this world for brick and mortar retail.
01:04:15 Like it fulfills some some need like community that that that, you know,
01:04:20 you know, we're all just old right now.
01:04:22 I feel like anyone under the age of twenty four is probably listening to this,
01:04:25 like being what the fuck are you talking about?
01:04:27 Just Amazon it.
01:04:28 I mean, Amazon. No, no.
01:04:30 Give us give the zoomers more more credit.
01:04:33 You can't Amazon a sense of community, Tom.
01:04:37 You can't you can't or you can't call up Jeff Bezos and say,
01:04:40 I'd like ten slices of hot, cheesy belonging.
01:04:46 It just it just doesn't happen.
01:04:48 The text isn't there yet.
01:04:49 I don't think there's any of us.
01:04:51 They haven't built it.
01:04:52 They haven't built a drone for it yet.
01:04:54 We have a minute.
01:04:55 We have a vtuber in our very presence right now.
01:04:57 We are looking in the eye, the community online being built in real time in front of us.
01:05:03 It's only a matter of time before what you're talking about is a relic of the past.
01:05:06 No, no.
01:05:07 The future is not old man.
01:05:09 No, no, it's not.
01:05:11 No, we're thirty.
01:05:13 We're thirty one, Ben.
01:05:14 We're thirty one.
01:05:15 We don't matter.
01:05:16 I'm thirty two, fucker.
01:05:18 Oh, well, okay.
01:05:19 I'm just making my case for me, bro.
01:05:23 Have you guys heard of Project Melody?
01:05:25 What's that?
01:05:26 Yeah.
01:05:28 Yes, that sounds familiar.
01:05:29 Vtuber porn.
01:05:33 It's the first Vtuber camera.
01:05:35 Yeah.
01:05:36 And all the all the all the regular cam girls got mad because like
01:05:40 Project Melody immediately crushed their numbers and revenue.
01:05:44 It's amazing.
01:05:45 She debuted and on Chatterbait,
01:05:49 she hit number one immediately and everyone got really mad
01:05:53 because all the all the cam girls were going to get replaced by robots.
01:05:57 Basically, the automation is here, except it's it's with an animated character.
01:06:02 This is why we needed Yang.
01:06:04 And we spurned him.
01:06:07 You're beyond for cam girls.
01:06:10 This is why would you?
01:06:13 OK, I don't know.
01:06:14 Like you're making you're making this lady.
01:06:17 You're like, this is going to be my little my little puppet,
01:06:20 my little my little internet fuck puppet.
01:06:22 I'm going to whore her out.
01:06:23 I'm going to prostitute her on the internet.
01:06:25 And she I mean, that's what it is.
01:06:28 I mean, you're not wrong.
01:06:30 I don't I don't want to come on.
01:06:31 I don't want to come on.
01:06:32 That's not me. That's not me being anti sex worker or anything.
01:06:35 But like that is what that is.
01:06:37 What's going on? I'm just saying, why would you do this?
01:06:39 And why? Why would you?
01:06:41 I don't understand why her bust size is so modest is what I'm saying.
01:06:44 Like you could look like anything and you and you went and you went modest with it.
01:06:49 I think I think it's because it might actually be.
01:06:51 Why wouldn't you go hand?
01:06:55 To appeal to the most amount of people, a lot of people get really upset
01:06:59 when there's big badonka donkers,
01:07:01 when there's big badonkas.
01:07:04 Oh, oh, my God, her back.
01:07:07 Oh, no, that's that's not healthy, bro.
01:07:10 That's fucked up. This is torture.
01:07:13 That's all you know.
01:07:14 The girl I told you about, the female artist I work with,
01:07:17 we see me, she gets so many comments like that.
01:07:19 That's oh, my God, her back.
01:07:21 Like, like, like this is anatomically impossible or something.
01:07:24 Like, shut up.
01:07:25 An anime face is anatomically impossible.
01:07:28 Nobody complains about that.
01:07:29 Did you know? Yeah, the eyes wouldn't even.
01:07:31 The eyes are so big, there's no brain.
01:07:33 There's no space for the brain.
01:07:37 I think they should just why not just consider them.
01:07:39 Yeah, aliens with giant tits. Yeah.
01:07:44 But where's that image of like a photo of like a grainy picture of an alien
01:07:48 and then they overlay and anime girl is the exact same proportions.
01:07:51 Yeah, that's the thing I'm talking about.
01:07:53 Yeah, I have not.
01:07:54 Literally true.
01:07:55 I have not seen that, but I was I was on the cutting edge
01:07:58 of all that stuff when I made the the punk only fans,
01:08:02 the the cartoon character, stick figure, pumpkin girl.
01:08:09 And I made money off of it.
01:08:10 You still any any any.
01:08:14 That's criminal.
01:08:15 It's quite interesting.
01:08:17 Do you do you guys think that VTubing
01:08:20 like VTuber characters might replace real streamers?
01:08:22 Well, I think there's always going to be a place for a real face.
01:08:27 But for everybody, I think what it's it's doing is the people who otherwise
01:08:32 wouldn't want to be seen on camera are now able to easily have a character
01:08:38 that is like attractive looking in some fashion.
01:08:41 Like it's they can make it look exactly however you like.
01:08:44 So the amount of streamers doing that will just flood the market.
01:08:49 And the people with real faces will be overshadowed.
01:08:54 Just by quantity, I think.
01:08:57 I mean, I feel like even Pokemon did it.
01:09:03 Yeah, I mean, I think it will probably take up some of the current
01:09:09 of like the non VTube streamer market.
01:09:12 But, you know, it won't.
01:09:15 I mean, the the the the there's too many.
01:09:17 There's always going to be space for German 985 always.
01:09:20 Right.
01:09:21 Right.
01:09:23 Yeah, it's it'll split.
01:09:24 It'll split the market, but it won't, you know.
01:09:27 Yeah, I don't think it'll outright replace it, but it'll definitely become
01:09:29 a significant portion of I mean, it already is.
01:09:33 Yeah, I think it'll just become more and more mainstream.
01:09:36 Guys, I have an answer for you.
01:09:38 I think they're getting.
01:09:39 I think I think VTubers are going to replace everyone.
01:09:41 All humans.
01:09:42 You know why?
01:09:43 You know what?
01:09:44 I have proof.
01:09:45 I have proof.
01:09:46 All right.
01:09:47 What's the proof?
01:09:50 Ben's lecture.
01:09:52 What?
01:09:53 What?
01:09:54 In the ending of Pastel Defender Heliotrope, the whole world is virtual and everyone's
01:10:01 using a virtual avatar.
01:10:03 They.
01:10:04 Oh God.
01:10:05 Yeah.
01:10:06 Well, that's pastel.
01:10:07 This is this is Mundus Mundus.
01:10:09 Okay.
01:10:10 We've got we've got we don't have to be condemned to the same to the same fate.
01:10:16 I for one, accept it.
01:10:20 I guess they are kind of using they're like, yeah, they're like raw data.
01:10:23 They're like like these like abstract like data structures just kind of floating in
01:10:27 some sort of like information information void.
01:10:31 I don't know.
01:10:32 It's it's yeah.
01:10:34 I guess I guess on the way towards that perfect like future of leaving our bodies.
01:10:39 VTubing.
01:10:40 It's just like Oscar brain.
01:10:42 VTubing.
01:10:43 You just know what that is.
01:10:44 Intermediate step.
01:10:45 A metro is like the the nesting dolls.
01:10:48 Yeah.
01:10:49 So there's this concept in sci-fi called a matrioshka brain.
01:10:53 The idea is we build a megastructure around a sun that powers computers that just run
01:10:59 our brains.
01:11:00 And then we all have fun and VR forever.
01:11:04 What happens when the sun explodes?
01:11:06 I guess we all explode.
01:11:08 I mean, that would happen whether you're virtual or not.
01:11:11 We're already kind of fucked when the sun explodes.
01:11:15 We just zooshes up to another star.
01:11:18 I mean, it's a few billion years or something.
01:11:21 Right.
01:11:22 Yeah.
01:11:23 Wait, I don't.
01:11:24 Okay.
01:11:25 Okay.
01:11:26 I understand.
01:11:27 Imagine being in the digital realm for a billion years.
01:11:30 Based.
01:11:31 Was there like that thing where they're trying to like do time dilation.
01:11:34 So like time in a virtual space goes by slower than real life.
01:11:37 So you can do like years and like an hour or something in real in the real world.
01:11:40 That's what we need.
01:11:41 That's the close.
01:11:42 That's the hyperbolic time chamber.
01:11:45 Right.
01:11:46 But you would flex your digital muscles and therefore gain.
01:11:50 So cool.
01:11:51 I understand.
01:11:52 So like gain and tell.
01:11:53 Imagine going into the time chamber for 10 years doing nothing but drawing and then come
01:11:57 out in five minutes of pass and you go in a child at drawing and come out a fucking god.
01:12:02 They have that in Dragon Ball.
01:12:04 Yeah.
01:12:05 Yeah.
01:12:06 Hyperbolic time chamber.
01:12:07 But then you still spent five years like you're still five years older.
01:12:10 No.
01:12:11 Because like your brain is just processing time differently.
01:12:14 So like when you come back out into the physical world only a couple hours have passed like
01:12:19 your perception of time in the virtual space is different.
01:12:22 And that's that's there even a physical world at that point.
01:12:25 Are we always why would you why would you even bother with the physical world then.
01:12:29 Right.
01:12:30 I mean at that point you wouldn't have to like you could argue at that point to take
01:12:33 it like that would be if that would be assuming the physical reality is still prominent but
01:12:39 like the eventual end game to that be everybody exists in virtual world and your lifespan is
01:12:43 now like hundreds if not thousands of years which would be fucking sick.
01:12:47 You know the thing I always get scared about like just thinking about this this putting
01:12:52 a brain in the digital realm so it can do anything at once forever is like from the
01:12:58 perspective of someone on the outside you know like all right the person in queue to
01:13:03 be brain digitized is in front of me and then they go into the thing and then they
01:13:09 decide to do nothing because they have no you know they can do anything they want and
01:13:14 they decide to do nothing forever.
01:13:16 Well I mean people do nothing for their oh all of all of the all of the the ideas they
01:13:22 had all of the plans they had there's no real reason to do any of them anymore so they just
01:13:26 they just don't.
01:13:27 I mean people do nothing with their entire life as it stands now I feel like it would
01:13:31 still be a net positive like you'll still have people who aren't motivated but that
01:13:35 just gives them more time to possibly find some sort of motivation and if you're in
01:13:42 a virtual world you wouldn't have to worry about your body decaying and breaking down
01:13:45 on you which makes that endeavor more difficult as you gain more experience like wouldn't
01:13:50 it suck to be like 50 something finally like want to like oh man I really want to do like
01:13:55 a physical activity like that's what like my passion life always was I was just too afraid
01:13:59 to do it but now you're 50 something and you're just broken and you can't do it anymore like
01:14:03 that blows like being organic sucks kill physical bodies virtual reality.
01:14:08 Yeah that's that's why I that's why I would like prefer to like to go halfway and be like
01:14:16 cyborg so that you can augment your physical body I don't think rather than computing your
01:14:22 entire consciousness.
01:14:23 Oh I don't think we should ever digitize our consciousness I think the proper way to
01:14:27 do it would be like the brain and nervous system still exist we would just like have
01:14:32 that connect directly to a virtual reality and hopefully we'd have some sort of nanomachines
01:14:36 or artificial stem cells that could continually repair the like necessary organic components
01:14:42 that keep our bodies going while our minds exist entirely in a virtual space or entirely
01:14:47 within like a machine body because as soon as you digitize your brain it's an artificial
01:14:53 copy and you are technically dead like you are your brain and nervous system yeah I can
01:14:59 I can one up you you don't even need a virtual space you know what you need you just need
01:15:04 a you just need your brain to get taken out put into some sort of like containment unit
01:15:12 that'll keep the brain alive for as long as possible then you just get your brain to through
01:15:17 some sort of artificial means just pump dopamine you experience nothing but you experience
01:15:22 fulfillment forever I mean that's so fucking scary I've seen I've seen I've seen that that's
01:15:29 like the prototype for the matrix right that was what they said in that movie that they
01:15:32 first tried to make utopia but it didn't work because humans like necessarily need suffering
01:15:37 anything which I think is probably bullshit but like for the rules of that world that's
01:15:40 what their initial idea was it's not a utopia it's just a the brain is just it's dormant
01:15:45 it's just got it's just got its fulfillment glands activated or whatever it is it is as
01:15:50 equivalent to death in my eyes I've seen things like that yeah I'm like it really it really
01:15:56 forces you to grapple with what is the per you know what is life if you are perfectly
01:16:01 content and do nothing forever so in one of my comedy really be called life in one of
01:16:07 my comics which is like an anarcho-capitalistic utopia I wrote yeah so in that one everything's
01:16:16 run by this one guy called the director who's basically just Jeff Bezos except he actually
01:16:21 owns all business which comic is that Crawling Dreams I thought so okay yeah I was gonna say
01:16:28 it but I didn't want to embarrass myself his name is Jeff Barzo very thinly veiled Jeff
01:16:34 Bizarro he's just called the director because he's the director of all businesses so basically
01:16:39 and also all the police are just private security for this one company because the company owns
01:16:44 everything anyway so in this world basically the way the plot is going is that everyone is going
01:16:52 to be just working themselves to death so that at the moment they hit 60 they can become part of
01:16:59 this like big tower that just like feeds their brain dopamine keeps them artificially alive and
01:17:04 that's why everyone's working yeah gross that's retirement in this world that's retired that's
01:17:11 pretty funny actually yeah it's like why bother with like yeah why bother with your normal
01:17:18 mortal terrestrial retirement let's just skip to the good part just skip to the part yeah where you
01:17:24 go on a dope event then you need a terrorist organization with cloud strife to blow up the
01:17:29 brain tower hell yeah I don't know I guess I mean I'm obviously speaking supremely biased
01:17:39 because like I'm living in like a physical body and like having to deal with all the struggles of
01:17:43 modernity but it feels like to me that just like getting a fucking dopamine ivy and definitely
01:17:48 seems like you're almost not even alive at that point like when you lose your autonomy right like
01:17:54 the whole purpose of like being alive I feel isn't so much like pleasure but like accomplishing
01:17:59 something or like setting goals and trying to accomplish them I feel the same way even though
01:18:03 I logically know it makes no sense to feel that way because all the reason we're doing anything
01:18:08 is because of dopamine releases right yeah I guess on like an instinctual level that's true
01:18:14 I don't want to be brand the broken I want to be like that is just brand the broken yeah
01:18:23 like I feel nothing oh you're your shit fuck you brand stupid when when when we're all
01:18:30 dopamine soaked brains in a big tower then we'll say oh man uh new bad old good remember having
01:18:37 physical bodies guys remember back when we did things remember death death was so cool that was
01:18:43 so base like what a great motivation remember pain you know I don't remember pain I kind of feel
01:18:50 nostalgic about it I want to I want to cause pain let's let's go back yeah yeah super villains are
01:18:55 born everyone tries to kill each other everything just keeps going in cycles
01:19:00 idea for a comic it's just it's just the day-to-day lives of a bunch of brains floating in a
01:19:09 van that's all kind of be like hmm how will I stimulate my neurons today it's like uh uh rich
01:19:16 richard you stimulated my fucking my my my pain center ah he quit that he knocked it off like
01:19:24 ha ha I have I fucking jacked into the to the control center I can give you a little zap
01:19:30 and it's uh it's very funny it's very goofy you know there's a bunch of can they be a girl so I'll
01:19:35 have that done by tomorrow yeah no anime anime girl versions their eyes are too big there's no
01:19:42 brain it's true we did anime girl versions of emotions it's just inside out but they're all
01:19:47 girls this time no no thank you to fucking uh kitchen after this podcast apparently we're
01:20:00 gonna get pressured into it by our viewers I I don't know when I will have the time but I am
01:20:06 I mean I have the software I asked mage about it because mage made a made a well he's made two
01:20:11 actually I was gonna say like there's 3d versus 2d vtubers right like you can do a 3d model or you
01:20:17 can do like a live 2d rig I'm assuming Mary you're using the live 2d one right now yeah all right
01:20:22 I I've got a questions to ask um for the setup with the webcam and lighting how how important is
01:20:29 that to be like high quality video feed the guy at the store told me that 4k is best but I don't
01:20:37 really believe him anymore do you I mean do you have like I don't yeah do you worry about like
01:20:44 do you have to like keep your face well lit and stuff so that it like tracks or do you just
01:20:50 like not that big of a deal you want to try I'm gonna I can try turning off the light oh and then
01:20:56 we see you okay oh I mean yeah I'm sorry okay but like you don't have any like you don't have any
01:21:03 like track lighting or like spotlighting or whatever okay is that enough yeah because I I'm
01:21:10 think that my webcam I have is really a terrible old piece of shit and I'm not sure because I I got
01:21:15 this this one program which is not the program that people use when I was looking into it and it
01:21:20 didn't work at all um I will get live 2d at some point nice I'm gonna have to build all of the pieces
01:21:28 and look at tutorial videos so like I use I use face rig face rig yeah well face live 2d is the
01:21:37 one for like making the puppet and face rig is for like doing yeah tracking like something I haven't
01:21:44 yeah I don't know that much about it I just I may just told me a little bit about how it works so
01:21:48 there's all these like really creepy characters on face right what yeah oh god oh no what has happened
01:21:57 oh yes I think oh there's isn't there a wolf with a gamer headset do you have that one
01:22:08 whoa that one seems super good we eat things traveling I like I like the cheeseburger
01:22:14 oh no oh my god okay I don't remember I don't remember these that's scary all right well
01:22:22 terrifying we don't have to we don't have to do all that come back for all the cherub next time
01:22:31 I looked I looked at um yeah the 3d I guess the one that the 3d one is called vroid is for making
01:22:39 your 3d model yeah I looked at that and it's really neat how it's like a sort of user friendly art
01:22:48 program that is like specifically designed for like 3d sculpting like an anime character
01:22:55 oh I tried to make one I just didn't want an anime character is the annoying thing I wanted to make
01:22:59 like a like a one of my characters in my style yeah I would I would want a 2d one for sure
01:23:08 I feel like if you're trying to do a custom like art style the 2d one makes more sense
01:23:13 I I think it just looks like the program looks like a lot of fun to just like fuck around with
01:23:20 and like try to push the limits of and see like what happens if I make it like this what if I
01:23:26 like fuck around with it like this like how how much can I get away with in terms of like
01:23:32 what it will accept as like a face you know what I mean uh uh uh oh the way live 2d works
01:23:40 see like you you separate out each uh each part of the drawing right and that's how it
01:23:45 kind of maps everything so as long as you have like some sort of shape for the eye it will animate
01:23:50 it and treat it like an eye I would assume I don't think the aesthetic matters too much but I haven't
01:23:55 looked into it I'm just kind of making baseless assumptions I suppose yeah I don't know uh uh I
01:24:01 assume you tell it like okay I assume that like live uh uh or face rig probably has a bunch of like
01:24:08 preset with like nose like where to place like your eyebrows like your corners of your eyes you
01:24:14 know your nose your nostrils corners of your mouth chin lips whatever I think you like put
01:24:18 tracking points on there to define like where those are relative to a normal face yeah yeah and then
01:24:23 it's like maybe you have like the mouth layer and it like you know that one's controlled like on top
01:24:28 of it or something and uh you know the whatever yeah I don't fucking yeah you're uh Mary you're um
01:24:36 dog boy excuse me um is is that oh it's a social faux pas uh yeah is that like a
01:24:46 like a pre-built thing because it looks very slick very professional and and custom oh custom so
01:24:55 who drew it uh Japanese artist named Kirito cool Kirito how many layers does that need
01:25:02 because I noticed when you move your torso a bit there's like a like a fake 3d-ness
01:25:07 to to the the a lot of a lot of layers yeah yeah let me let me let me let me give you an expression
01:25:16 that shows a lot of layers oh my god I don't even I really I like I like how you you can I don't know
01:25:29 I I like when the hair moves I like how the hair kind of you I think you can tell the hair like
01:25:36 how to behave like how flowy to be and stuff like how to like follow the character or something
01:25:42 yeah there's a lot to it there's a lot to it that I really want to dig into just because I think it
01:25:46 looks interesting I have a I have a rigor for it who like makes edits to it and plays around with
01:25:52 like the the different moods you can get on this character so the most recent addition has been
01:25:58 um my ears yeah I I saw I saw and I was shocked I saw it wait who's who's the girl that you do
01:26:10 streams with Lumi Lumi yeah yeah I saw her uh uh I think she put a video on Twitter the other day
01:26:21 and I noticed her she has a hand yeah and I'm like how how how the fuck does she how the
01:26:28 fuck does it know where her hand is yeah the in that 3d we had to thing yeah there I think
01:26:35 there was a thing where you could like have a button to have a hand motion or maybe use your
01:26:40 hands wave them in front and like the 3d model would also wave its hand um in the same way we're
01:26:46 doing it is a the way we're doing it is a special glove oh like okay I was I thought maybe because
01:26:55 like it it would have to know it has to know like if you if you didn't have like a glove with sensors
01:27:03 or something it would have to like be able to know like when the hand comes on screen versus
01:27:07 when it goes off screen and then to like recalibrate like which finger is which finger and yeah so is
01:27:16 it kind of like a VR sort of glove yeah yeah okay a lot of the equipment is also used for VR
01:27:23 games and stuff yeah yeah yeah I had I had thought about it I had thought about like I wonder if they
01:27:28 can have hands I would like to make one with hands and I was like I haven't seen any with hands and
01:27:32 then I saw I saw Lumi moving her hand around I was like oh my god what technology has gone too far
01:27:39 uh you should see like some of the some of the vtubers actually they like they can do dances
01:27:47 and stuff with their characters like full body dancing yeah they have a full body VR suits
01:27:54 like in like in ready say ready player go just is that what project melody has I think so yeah she
01:28:03 must be fully functional if you know what I'm saying the funny thing when I when I like wave
01:28:10 my hand in front of my model it goes crazy look whoa whoa whoa it's like interrupting the tracking
01:28:19 of your face yeah so it doesn't know what to do yeah when I when I fucked around with face rig I
01:28:25 was using some of those those hideous 3d default models and I think it it was either the lighting
01:28:31 or just the crappiness of my webcam that it like it had a little bit of trouble like it had a little
01:28:37 bit of trouble like following me like where like wherever I moved sometimes it would kind of like
01:28:43 lose track of where my face was and just kind of jump back to like default position yeah and I was
01:28:49 like I assume I have to like really have a nice like clear like camera setup that's like very easy
01:28:56 for the computer to understand or I would need to maybe like go in and do some like custom fiddling
01:29:02 with the like the rigging to like I don't know so it like matches like the shape of my face better
01:29:08 or something like that I don't know uh yeah it's very it's very neat it's very cool uh I'm not afraid
01:29:17 of technology I welcome it uh uh damn
01:29:25 so uh how you guys you know if we are all yeah if we are if we all become anime girls and all
01:29:30 donate to each other it'll basically be like what yang not wanted yang the automation is to take our
01:29:39 job it's gonna take our streaming jobs next wait if we all donate to each other then wouldn't just
01:29:45 paypal get loads of money oh it will go up to Elon musk no no is he not the paypal man anymore
01:29:52 I don't know I don't think but he's the one he likes anime too so maybe he'll be he'll be willing
01:29:57 but this is long con he's the one who's secretly financing face rig so he'll be like the next
01:30:03 fucking tesla rocket a launch will have like an elon musk anime girl vtuber narrating it nice
01:30:11 ah elon musk would have a fucking you know he liked one of my comics ones
01:30:22 no shit which one the one where I turned him into an anime girl oh okay I don't know if I've seen
01:30:29 that one but someone someone must have brought it to his attention I almost considered because
01:30:33 there's like a tesla store nearby I almost considered going there asking them for a free tesla
01:30:38 because elon liked me on twitter elon liked my tweet I think I believe in your company policy
01:30:44 it says uh one elon like is worth one tesla three tesla yes yes i think that could work if you just
01:30:54 kept badgering them about it yeah just keep harassing them it's the twitter guy again it's
01:31:01 two likes now there's two likes that's fucking twitter guy how's everyone's uh how's it how's
01:31:08 everyone's week going how how's you how's your personal life oh it's great yeah it's a 10 out of
01:31:15 same same same it I'm living the peak quarantine life I want to throw peanuts at crows today nice
01:31:24 yeah save those I want those actually send them in the send them in the mail and I heard that
01:31:30 that crows can recognize your face if you feed them for long enough and then they'll bring you
01:31:35 trinkets yep no shit yeah crows are very smart they I think I remember a story of like a girl who
01:31:44 fed the crows a lot and the crows all knew her in the community like the crows talked to each
01:31:51 other about this is the girl she was she had a lot of cloud in the crow she did she literally had a
01:31:55 lot of crow clouds ironically yeah and they would protect her from bullies that's I don't think that
01:32:01 part happened no they're like now you when you say that I imagine that like some bullies are coming
01:32:08 and the crows like all like flock to her and like form like a big suit around no all the crows all
01:32:14 the crows like show up behind like behind her and like eye down this bully they're like do you want
01:32:19 to learn why we're called a murder of crows and then just beat the fuck out of them you know you
01:32:23 know in Naruto how how like gara had like the sand that would like always protect him from any
01:32:29 attack it's like that but like a flock of crows yeah she carries a stream of water bottle of
01:32:34 filled with crows on our back this gourd of crows she has like a giant a big like I don't know a big
01:32:41 like like bird feeder like a maybe a big like log with like seed like glued to it with peanut butter
01:32:47 or something it's just covered with crows the crows like seeds they must birds like seeds
01:32:54 yeah that's the one thing I know about birds they like seeds seems fair uh yeah my my weeks my
01:33:02 multiple days of of stuff have been mostly just fucking around playing video games and
01:33:10 thinking so hard thinking every day about um the bell jpeg book of my first comic it's all part of
01:33:18 the process that I that I made the first page in photoshop I was like ah I see I could I could
01:33:23 put the the text here and then I could put the page number up here and I could be exactly the same
01:33:29 as the the homestuck physical versions where it has the little author comments at the bottom
01:33:34 and I was like I'm gonna write author comments I tried to write one I'm like oh no I'm stupid
01:33:39 though I can't write this is this is not gonna work I think yeah I was thinking of doing I was
01:33:48 considering doing something similar with slime and punishment and I think that I could I think I would
01:33:53 find it pretty not a brag or anything but I could probably write them very well I feel like I know
01:33:59 exactly what I an egg yeah maybe um I boys I'm back at it I'm lifting again I'm fucking ripped
01:34:10 I'm jacked uh two weeks in and I'm stronger than anyone has ever been
01:34:19 Ben's getting ready for if Trump wins again he's gonna take it to the streets
01:34:25 he's gonna help jump over the buildings they they're not gonna they're not gonna fucking throw me
01:34:30 out of a helicopter all right we're not going down without a fight uh I've been drinking my almond milk
01:34:40 uh almond milk is based it's so based yeah I love almond milk I've I've discovered it in this past
01:34:47 year uh uh people people talking about oat milk being the new hotness oat milk has carbs
01:34:53 unacceptable on acceptable it's all about the all costco the big like I buy and buy the crates
01:35:00 I'll buy like 24 cartons of uh of Kirkland almond milk at a time holy shit you get it you gotta buy
01:35:06 in bulk all right you're on a totally different level than me then oh my god no I'm drinking
01:35:10 it I'm drinking like I need to start hitting up cost so Aldi is closed right now so this entire month

01:35:18 groceries I need to go down to Costco I swear to god I swear to god my instacart subscription
01:35:24 has paid for itself because with instacart subscription I can send other people to go
01:35:30 and shop at Costco for me I do not have to buy a Costco membership to benefit from their incredibly
01:35:36 low low prices I want to go to Costco and use my ebt cards and then I pay like literally nothing
01:35:42 yeah well that's you know that's true but I'm not that worried about it I'm not that worried I
01:35:48 get you like I don't know the ebt point I can use them later I'll use them later it's pretty sounds
01:35:53 pretty bougie to me not having to worry about your fucking money oh worry I'm worried about the
01:35:58 they reduce my benefits like they cut me but it's okay I'm gonna I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make

01:37:33 imagine not crafting your own keto gummies imagine having like normal food how sad
01:37:39 I've perfected a new recipe by the way hell yeah I I have utilized I have utilized the power
01:37:45 of pectin and mono calcium phosphate that's all I have to say about that the pectin the pectin
01:37:54 really really brings out the flavor really imparts a little bit more of that candy consistency
01:37:58 so it doesn't just taste like hard jello uh and it helps the flavors shine a lot more it's very
01:38:06 really on to something one of these days I have to partake in your science experiments they've
01:38:10 they've evolved the ones I'm making now are like nothing like the old ones I feel like
01:38:14 I'm gonna have there I'm gonna have like I'm gonna have to make like mark one mark two mark three
01:38:19 Mary oh my god he's he's huge he's so cute oh no what is happening ah scary oh Jesus Christ
01:38:29 it's too it's too big frankly it's just a little bit too big for my day that really is I take it

01:38:44 all over the damn place is this what a zoomer is he's got no legs it's like oh my god he's got he's
01:38:48 got a torso I can't that's so weird that's wild I didn't know I you know what I I didn't know I was
01:39:02 curious how far down it extended but now I'm soul now I'm yeah now I'm glad that I know
01:39:11 neat yeah I've been doing I've been doing fucking anyway yeah I've been doing squats I've been doing
01:39:17 this and that moving my legs and they hurt now and that's good it's good it's good to feel pain
01:39:25 it's a good pain it's pretty good we've spoken like a flesh bag oh pain's good
01:39:33 my weak physical body I have to train with fucking resistance trading oh I have to break
01:39:39 it so I can build it back up instead of just like buying the better model of body oh how pathetic
01:39:45 we're all sad flesh bags the worst I don't know I don't know I something about the the the feeling
01:39:53 of like you know like I sat down the other day I was like wow my butt's bigger than it used to be
01:40:03 that I can feel it and that's good is that good it's it's is that what you want yeah okay that's
01:40:08 what I was so what you want it's it's always been like really bony and terrible and now it feels
01:40:13 like an actual thing are you are you eating big I don't think I'm really eating enough to make a
01:40:19 lot of progress I'm not doing it very efficiently well there's your fucking problem I have I have I
01:40:25 mean I have such a small brain I can't remember anything yeah so the only thing I'm you know that
01:40:31 is your problem it's all I'm doing is working out doing my routine every other day and I eat
01:40:42 whatever I eat when I'm hungry and it's it's it's making some progress and I that's fine by me
01:40:49 hell yeah I was just me being working out and being based is awesome it's not enough
01:40:55 it's never enough I mean it'll never be enough but like I don't know there's already too many
01:41:00 things in my life where I say oh it's never enough I don't need to add like fitness to that that's
01:41:05 doing something is better than nothing exactly I'll like this two weeks into two weeks into
01:41:12 getting back on the wagon and already already I can feel my whole worldview shifting just the other
01:41:17 day I thought like hey what if I like wore clothes that fit oh I saw that tweet yeah that was terrifying
01:41:25 I was like I was like should I like call Ben and see if he's okay this is like a tweet you would
01:41:29 put out you know that you know that meme where it's just like what would you tweet to let people
01:41:33 know that like you were in trouble like that's that's what I think you're like a nice outfit
01:41:40 what if I was dressed like in a fucking suit and tie or something and I was tempted to just be like
01:41:46 tweet out something like horseshoe theories real because like you've gone so far left you like
01:41:50 want to dress like a fucking like super like alt rider guy now but it's like that won't that won't
01:41:55 fit all right they're just expensive and those yeah all the all the all right they've reclaimed
01:42:02 suits they really have nobody can nobody can wear suits anymore they've they've got the market
01:42:07 cornered yeah we everyone else has to dye their pink and and wear like mesh vests and I don't know
01:42:14 rainbow uh I don't know tattoos whatever the fuck what about Sanji who from one piece he's a Nazi
01:42:24 give Sanji Sanji he is out of the germa clan
01:42:34 have you been keeping up with one piece who me well I guess you I do you read one piece Mary
01:42:40 I um I did until the fish people and then I kind of fell out of it I which which fish I have read
01:42:48 a little further than you but I'm like I'm like a while behind I'm like a few months behind
01:42:52 anything I almost caught up at radcon when you say everyone's underwater and there's this giant lady
01:42:59 oh okay yeah that's quite far in and this guy who doesn't wash his hand throws axes at her
01:43:07 doesn't wash his hand yeah he doesn't wash his hand um because he wears a gloves vandodecken
01:43:13 his power is to throw something and it will always meet its mark and he's touched shirahoshi
01:43:18 so he doesn't touch anything on that hand again so that he can throw things at it forever oh right
01:43:24 that's his secret plan you forgot about that you're such a one piece idiot Ben
01:43:31 shirahoshi is the best uh girl design she's the same as all of the others she's just bigger
01:43:40 she isn't wait wait wait no no no I'm not thinking who was her mom the queen otohime
01:43:44 otohime is my favorite that's what I meant yeah she was great she's sick she's sick as
01:43:50 is she big too no she's small I think the next you along is the big one she's she's
01:43:57 otohime is kind of big but not like big big she's like one piece small aka like eight feet tall
01:44:06 saw a tweet the other day uh that was like well it was a visual diagram but the long
01:44:12 and short of it was what if all the big people in one piece like uh uh um like uh donky hote and uh
01:44:21 who's the fucking nightmare guy the shadow guy shadow guy yeah on on thriller bark
01:44:29 oh gecko moria the shishibukai yeah like what if all the big people like donky hote and gecko moria
01:44:34 are actually just normal sized people and people like zoro and luffy are just tiny they're just like
01:44:39 three feet tall that's funny makes makes you think can't disprove it that's just well you can't
01:44:47 disprove it because he said how tall they are um maybe maybe the the planet is lying like like
01:44:56 like this is people like the gravity is different maybe the plant's quite small so like people grow
01:45:01 really big because the gravity doesn't squish them that much and the the yeah the luffy maybe the
01:45:09 maybe the planet in one piece is flat how what do you think about that why would they sail around the
01:45:15 grand line makes a lot of sense actually yeah you know i don't know it makes no sense there is there
01:45:20 is no red line it's just there's just the there's just the dirt wall there's where's the car there's
01:45:25 just the car you see the curve the whole time no oda has never drawn the curve oh water finds
01:45:37 it's impossible he refuses to draw the curve because he knows he knows one of my uh one of
01:45:43 my favorite things recently is watching like flatter of his own videos on youtube oh i i
01:45:51 it sounds like folding ideas really big it's a whole genre of like videos and it's got its own
01:45:58 like youtube creators and it's got its own keemstar figure it's really funny oh my god yeah okay that's
01:46:05 that's pretty funny the anti-flatter scene i didn't know about that so there's this one guy called
01:46:11 si man dan and um so some of the flat earth is called him satan man dan okay okay oh because he
01:46:20 is a heretic i guess yeah and one of them has this like obsession with walt disney
01:46:27 for the flatters or the anti-flatter the the flat earth is they have this obsession
01:46:31 with walt disney because they think he's like part of the worldwide conspiracy so they call him walt
01:46:36 hitler yeah okay donald duck uh it's all in that one cartoon
01:46:46 i um you know the last flat earth thing i watched was the uh uh the one the new the newest video
01:46:53 from uh in you and not any i always confuse them folding yeah i watched that one and he went further
01:47:00 than just like how it's for earth is round idiot it was like it was like the whole reason that people
01:47:08 fall into these types of ideas and the the sort of desire of of wanting to make sense of the world
01:47:18 and all of the dangers that come with that i wish the earth was flat yeah then i could throw
01:47:25 like a rock wouldn't it wouldn't make a difference i mean the and if if some of their theory is to
01:47:32 be believed the Antarctic would be like um would be all surrounding us like a giant ice wall to just
01:47:39 kept us out and maybe there would be maybe there would be more worlds with more what if what if
01:47:45 the real world is like minecraft and if you get past that point it starts like the the world's
01:47:52 generation starts fucking up yeah you go into the far lands of real life but nobody's ever
01:47:59 made it that far because it's too cold and they always turn around all i know the earth is flat
01:48:08 nobody's proven otherwise no one can convince me i don't know that's not true that's not true
01:48:13 because in that video i mentioned he literally proves that the earth is round so never mind
01:48:18 now the the earth is the game of thrones intro it's upside inside out earth
01:48:26 it's inside out it's like halo but a sphere it's sphero
01:48:35 it's like it's like a hey it's like a ring but if the ring was like yeah
01:48:41 toward yeah yeah rotated 360 degrees extended in a polar sort of fashion i would be interested to
01:48:48 see how that would look rendered like i've always loved the way halo looks when you see the the ring
01:48:55 in the distance going all the way up do you um do you guys have any more questions for
01:49:01 oh i have a question here's an interview type question um you you say you write comics uh
01:49:10 do how did you get your start we look in in in terms of like getting people to draw them for you
01:49:20 i did you just have the money to do it or i have a follow-up question i have a follow-up
01:49:25 question do you want me to answer first or yeah i wrote a i wrote a message that basically said
01:49:34 i want to do a comic i have this and this budget and then i copy pasted it to 600 people on dvn
01:49:40 die wow so i mean that's how you do it was your budget yeah um what what was your budget for the
01:49:50 first one like 200 dollars for like uh for like uh for like i don't know what the first one like
01:50:00 what a yeah what did 200 dollars pay for basically nothing but it got you started and and now look
01:50:09 at you i i was gonna say um um did you have like a did you have like a big break moment or something
01:50:16 when like you went from like just doing this as a hobby to like was there like a moment when
01:50:21 like you got like exposed and you were like uh hey i've sort of broken out into the into the
01:50:29 it um industry i say in quotes it came in three waves yeah uh the first wave was after i'd gotten
01:50:38 my job as a sales guy at a company uh i started having a lot more money to throw at comics so i
01:50:45 could hire a much better artist and i did a comic with him and that comic was drawn really well and
01:50:51 so i just marketed it like crazy on twitter and it gave me a lot of followers um the second wave
01:50:59 came when i got Ushimi the girl who draws big tits um and nice yeah that that came that that is
01:51:09 just that that's just why that i don't need to explain yeah and then the third wave was the
01:51:16 third wave was when i started um doing uh internet exploratory and just like the meme characters
01:51:25 yeah that was the first time i really did like a comic that was made just for twitter not like
01:51:31 with a longer plot like it turned it turned into a series later but that was the first time i did
01:51:36 like uh yeah when i i remember reading it and being surprised when it kind of like yeah it does
01:51:44 it does develop a plot eventually and i was like oh oh shit okay yeah uh hmm so for the uh for the
01:51:52 anniversary we got like a really good artist to come in and do like 180 panels worth of action
01:51:58 for for a thing so that was really tough yeah yeah um i didn't realize we've been going for
01:52:05 almost two hours now yeah time flies when you are talking about dopamine and flat earthers

01:56:46 to tom's patreon bonus podcast at patreon.com slash polystation two and here's some of how maybe he'd
01:56:52 want to make a fighting game one day and it got me thinking a lot of times this kind of thing will
01:56:56 come up and the chat or comments will be like yeah i'd love to see a fighting game where i'm playing
01:57:01 as my favorite pcb member and that'd be cool i guess but really i'd love to see a fighting game
01:57:07 with your ocs as the playable characters especially if they were in their original art styles i would
01:57:13 love to see a 3d a zoomy fighting a very simplistic 2d pump i want to see a black and white sophia
01:57:22 having a zoning battle against saraya that's what i would love to see out of a pcb fighting game
01:57:29 it'd be the most eclectic thing since angel i've actually thought about this and i would be all
01:57:35 in for it i don't have making of making like a smash clone with all of our characters but i
01:57:40 would just i don't dare i don't dare to imagine such a thing uh i do all the time it'll be so
01:57:46 based i would run around i mean that's not even the first project i've thought about i thought
01:57:49 about make doing like a deck building game based on uh all of our oc characters and like print out
01:57:54 like a deck of cards with them a deck building game there's a lot of like floating around in my
01:57:58 magic that sounds like sounds like some real nerd shit oh super nerd shit just make top trumps
01:58:04 i have like the the you know top trumps no uh it's this very simplistic card game where uh there
01:58:17 was all the rage back in the playground where it's just a list of things and there's a bunch of
01:58:23 stats and the person just puts down and says i'm using this stat um like if it's like about
01:58:31 cars it's like oh the acceleration number and then the person who goes next if they have a higher
01:58:38 acceleration number they win and they take the cards and the winner is the one who takes all the
01:58:42 cards it's a weird it's it's what the wait what the fuck so you just you is it it's hard to explain
01:58:52 and so so okay so so the card has it has a list of arbitrary numbers that are related to whatever
01:59:00 the theme of the deck is like that they made so many of these things um there was one about dinosaurs
01:59:05 one about cars harry potter fucking everything lord of the rings but but so the ultimate goal
01:59:13 is just to have the yeah you have to put down your card and say which thing you're you're most
01:59:19 confident in winning um it's like uh i put down this dinosaur and it's like i don't know height
01:59:26 or whatever do you put it do you put it down not knowing what your yeah yeah it's a gamble whether
01:59:32 you have the bigger card and sometimes you get a dinosaur that is really good at something and
01:59:36 really bad at something else and if the other so okay so the you win by having the biggest number
01:59:44 so i imagine that the goal then is to like save your big numbers for like when it really matters
01:59:50 like when no i think you just have to use whatever is the at the top of your deck because you split
01:59:56 the deck in half oh so it's like war yeah war what's war yeah war is basically you split a
02:00:04 deck of cards in half and then you just like flip cards at each other and like whoever's
02:00:10 higher wins i guess so but um unlike a deck of cars they have multiple numbers you can choose on
02:00:16 each card but wouldn't you always just choose the biggest one no because because because like um
02:00:22 let's say it changes for every uh deck every themed card deck but like um sometimes like a
02:00:32 thing that's really like if we're talking about cars something has really high top speed
02:00:37 will have a really low something else and um you might have a car that has a low top speed but
02:00:44 a really high of that something else i can't think of an example because i haven't looked at these
02:00:47 acceleration or something something like that um and so you could strategically well actually
02:00:54 it's not really strategy so much as luck and then strategy it sounds like oh okay okay so so when
02:01:00 you're flipping these card decks like you're both gonna have cards that are like themed about like
02:01:06 cars yeah they're all cars in the whole day i was imagining that like you might have one guy flips
02:01:12 like a you know Toyota Corolla with like acceleration 50 and like you know armor 10 or whatever and
02:01:20 then the other guy flips over like uh uh you know mothra you know maximum flight flight speed you
02:01:26 know 50 miles per hour yeah it doesn't special move uh sleep powder it doesn't work like that because
02:01:32 the there are different numbers of stats in in different things yeah like cars have a lot of
02:01:40 different numbers associated with them and some cars just really based i i learned about the
02:01:46 McLaren i learned about all these these car of manufacturers names through this this stupid game
02:01:52 interesting anyway that was a bigger side and meant nothing yeah i mean i was thinking something
02:01:58 more along the lines of star realms but that's an interesting concept as well but anyways we're
02:02:03 talking about a fighting game uh it would be cool it would be like the most titanic endeavor ever
02:02:09 undertaken by all of us to buy i think buddy i was talking about man i was talking about uh
02:02:15 a pcp not not pcp well yeah rom hacks pokemon rom hacks on the stream this week and about how like
02:02:23 it's the kind of thing that i think about like oh what if someone made like a pcp pokemon rom
02:02:28 hack or what if someone made like an rfck pokemon rom hack and it seems it seems just doable enough
02:02:34 but then i know that like if if i were to try to do it it would be like oh this is actually a
02:02:40 lot harder than i thought in all these different ways and it would probably end up taking like
02:02:44 weeks months definitely years even yeah yeah that's everything yeah and like it's like what a what a
02:02:51 shame if it were like to be half made and just like you really need a nightmare that that a
02:02:58 youngster energy where you can spend the entirety of your waking hours working on something and then
02:03:05 not having to think about like eating because your parents will make it for you i mean i mean when i
02:03:13 was in like college i like got rpg maker and i started working on i've probably talked about
02:03:19 this right i started working on the christian weston chandler's adult chronicles i was trying
02:03:24 to like make my own version of it and i put like a lot of time into that i made like sprites and
02:03:29 stuff i made started making maps it was not even close to like a finished product and yet it was
02:03:34 still like a pretty significant effort that i made towards it and like the shit takes a long time
02:03:40 it really really does oof i mean just to make that one room of venezuelan game took like the better
02:03:47 part of a year of just like working it just it takes so that was you building the game mechanics
02:03:53 at the same time right oh yeah there's a lot i mean there's a lot going on which is why it took so
02:03:58 long yeah but like you could if you have mechanics and like an entire game if you were to make another
02:04:03 room it wouldn't take as long for just that room no but like every time you enter you build like
02:04:08 because like i started building a level on top of that and it's like okay i want this level to like
02:04:12 because like the whole thing was supposed to take place in like a like an old factory or
02:04:16 something and like all right so there's gonna be a little thing so you have to dodge it like we'll
02:04:19 like crush you if you stand under them but like that has to be built out custom on top of like
02:04:23 everything else it's like okay so i know how to build a room but now i have to build like the
02:04:27 sequence of like uh like uh variables that cause these objects to go up and down in a certain pattern
02:04:34 and like i have to make sure the collision box follows that sprite that moves up and down and
02:04:38 how it controls everything so like it's just it's a lot video games are complicated as shit
02:04:43 video games are complicated and like a fighting game i've always like in the back of my mind
02:04:48 because i love fighting games Guilty Gear is my favorite thing in the entire fucking world
02:04:51 and i'm like i'd love to make a fighting game the problem with making a fighting game is that like
02:04:55 it's so simple on the surface because it's like well there's like two characters there's basically
02:04:59 no level design it's just making a pretty background but like the game balance is so
02:05:05 fucking hard because you have to make multiple characters you don't need to make game balance
02:05:08 and you have to make sure the balance is there and everything yeah you do if you want to make it
02:05:12 fun and like yeah yeah making a shitty fighting game is probably like i mean it's probably still
02:05:17 hard but it's probably like doable you could you could right you're just doing making a character
02:05:21 estate machine over and over and over and you just all you need to do is make punk op and i'll then
02:05:26 that'll be all i suppose that's true i suppose i could just do that to use our fire breath
02:05:34 um so what we're saying is uh yeah uh uh make it somebody else somebody else make it please i think
02:05:42 i think what we need to do is we need to get two hundred dollars we have to message six hundred
02:05:45 people on dvnart until somebody will make our game for us i think that's where all the games are
02:05:51 on dvnart yeah yeah exactly just go on itch.io and go to like right user page after user page like
02:05:58 hi i'm looking for someone to uh code me you go to fiverr.com yeah um i use fiverr to make a video
02:06:07 i have two i no i paid someone on fiverr to convert uh to convert a a png image that i had
02:06:15 into a a vector uh it was for the rc game the kickstarter thing how how are those pins going
02:06:21 by the way how's all that stuff have i not mentioned um i have uh the the lady has been like
02:06:29 sort of like hard to get a hold of lately but like i have all the pins except for one pin
02:06:36 and the coin and when i'm missing one of the pins i'm missing the coins but i have settled on the
02:06:42 final design and i just i literally i literally just have to give her the money and then it will
02:06:48 probably be another like whenever i she lets me do that it will probably be another like two weeks
02:06:56 or so until i have the product and then it will be done and i will have everything and i will start
02:07:01 chipping sick that has just kind of been going on in the background i'm so excited to have the
02:07:06 coins uh they i have the test coins here i i'm like made like a slight change to them but uh i'm
02:07:12 confident that they're going to look sick they're gonna look almost like these ones that i have
02:07:17 like a little different a little bit better um anyway anything else anything else about fighting
02:07:26 games or whatever the fuck what are we even talking about uh fighting games are sick i want to make a
02:07:31 shitty fighting game yeah i guess they're kind of sick i just started playing uh power rangers
02:07:36 battle for the grid actually good pretty cool worth twenty dollars what system is that on it's on
02:07:42 everything how i want to see it i want to see it is it new uh it's like a couple years old it was
02:07:50 like a budget game that came out it was like a small company made it so it's like kind of rough
02:07:55 around the edges but like the actual fighting system is really fun i mean i'm a little surprised
02:07:58 that like a power rangers game would come out in modern era yeah it's it's strange but it was
02:08:06 really fucking cool and i enjoyed it immensely weird yeah weird cool okay next one is from

02:10:02 and three two one go

02:11:04 next up is more yelling about digimon yeah i'm into this three two one go
02:11:12 i sent in that first digimon rural rumble voicemail since an huge influx of
02:11:16 similar voicemails proud of y'all anyway it's been i think in washington they try doing so in
02:11:20 japanese the english dub is full of character assassination there's a reason why people generally
02:11:26 like daisuke and taiki and absolutely hate davis and mikey yes i know worst of all is mimi
02:11:32 who in the original show is one of the best characters especially in japanese but the english
02:11:37 dub absolutely ruins her character for the sake of just valley girl generally making her dumb
02:11:43 it's actually kind of sexist and gross and it's not very good watch it in japanese
02:11:47 start with either the original mamora hisota short film or with tamers or
02:11:53 either work i didn't uh tom tamers is base but recently there's been one just as base
02:11:59 digimon universe aptly monster i know it sounds like some cringe emoji movie stuff it is not it's
02:12:04 a lot of social commentary about like the internet and youtube and how it's affected how
02:12:10 the youth see their future koreas etc very interesting it is on country roll in america
02:12:16 lastly digimon story cyber salute bundle both the original cyber salute and the spinoff hackers
02:12:22 memory 250 hour rpgs only $50 on pc and steam i meant pc and switch uh often on sale for half off
02:12:31 two very good deal digimon survive look space that first trailer was amazing but it keeps getting
02:12:36 delayed i hear a good thing about the manga so maybe check those out but i haven't read well
02:12:44 that's your uh sounds good that's your digimon uh content update uh for this for this week every
02:12:50 time someone talks about digimon i'm like oh digimon so fucking cool maybe i'll do a lecture
02:12:55 but that'd be a nightmare we should have should we get digital dream on as a guest
02:13:00 i i don't i maybe i don't know like that'd be fun probably for me i'd just get out of a digimon
02:13:08 i'd have a good time no honestly i wouldn't have that much to say about it i just think digital
02:13:16 dream is a very funny person i wouldn't i'll i'll get digital dream we'll do a podcast together
02:13:22 yeah yeah okay all right um next up is next up is that's how'd you how'd you know
02:13:31 i was gonna do for the intro it's i gotta figure out a new one now your name required
02:13:38 i have a great idea listen to me america i have important very important ideas this is what we
02:13:44 need to do every infant that's born every infant male we need to take them and cut their ear lobes
02:13:50 why number one it's unsightly number two uh greater chance of cancer more flesh equals
02:13:56 more cancer chance number three they can't get earrings therefore they can't be gay okay there
02:14:02 you go so we need to cut infants ear lobes off because it's it's worthless flesh it does nothing
02:14:09 it's completely functionless um it's great great idea let's do it roll it out it's the default
02:14:17 you have to opt out this is the future people cut away that which is unnecessary we don't need
02:14:25 appendixes we don't need pinky fingers we just need arms and legs no fingers no hands
02:14:35 just head and jar yeah just a head just brain and the dopamine column yeah i mean we already
02:14:43 you're a little late to the party we are way you're miles ahead of you
02:14:54 and the appendix i want to i'm gonna cut all of the the good parts out and just leave the ear lobes
02:15:01 and the friend your finger that's all i'm gonna be yeah just all the the worst parts the back of
02:15:08 the knee isn't there isn't there another like useless the front of the the front of the knees
02:15:12 lean what do we have two front of the knees so we can bend them no no no no no no no no um
02:15:19 that's the only useful organ that i've got um the penis uh maybe i don't know um so tonsils

02:15:53 heart would you guys be okay with it if i sang in the voicemails the thing about that is that we
02:16:00 i've run a really tight ship here and like voicemails have to pass a very strict strict
02:16:07 range and quality control uh criteria so um sing at your own peril my dude um next one is uh it was

02:18:27 but then you but then you stab them with a kunai and a puff of smoke you realize they were a simple
02:18:32 log the whole time this is uh three two one go
02:18:52 i think that was uh i think that was the genuine article
02:18:55 shows shows what i know
02:19:02 samurai the way the samurai she's sure must must be doing things such a multi talented character
02:19:08 such a robust character uh uh uh full of uh uh you can feel any niche really yeah next is
02:19:18 margar this fucker all right three two one go margar here in light of the recent uh
02:19:29 anti police and anti prison episode of the pcp i would like to uh send a formal application
02:19:39 for you to reconsider my place within voice prison i think that i've more than served my time and
02:19:47 been a uh good contributing member of society um you know just just just be cool man i'm just
02:19:54 being cool in prison how is he not uh i don't want to be here anymore how did we let this happen
02:20:01 how did we allow him
02:20:07 why do we let him have a phone he keeps sending he's not allowed to petition light him up and
02:20:13 they just don't finish the job has to be illegal somehow right this has this um the uh the uh the
02:20:21 the uh some no who who do we just make voice grail who do we just make voice grail appeal to
02:20:31 that guy appeal to that gut i don't remember the guy it doesn't matter it doesn't don't care he's
02:20:44 whoever that guy was his voice grail appeal to him because the only way to get out of voice jail
02:20:50 is to have someone is to have is to mutually annihilate in a burst of pure energy with the pot
02:20:56 the negatively charged uh the oppositely charged a voice grail i don't make the rules uh i accept
02:21:03 i kind of did but i don't so that's just i i yeah that's right i do in fact make the rules but i
02:21:12 have already made them and i'm not willing to reconsider i do make the rules i just won't
02:21:16 change them next up is bob story three three two one go hey so yeah uh quick follow-up to my story
02:21:26 from last week yes i took all of the pictures for her um oh this is the it was all her idea
02:21:34 i also put the pictures on fourchan a while later um like because she wanted you to right
02:21:41 but yeah the horror of it was that i had a christian video on like a playlist
02:21:50 playing while i was fingering her so i'm like having chris look at me from the corner of my
02:21:57 eye and he freaked me the fuck out it was also the first time i fingered a girl so is that too
02:22:04 gross uh everything about this is bad okay okay so this this really makes me think though this
02:22:13 really confirms my suspicion that the girl kind of just wanted to get fingered and maybe was using
02:22:20 the let's take pictures as just sort of a sort of a pretense to to sexualize the encounter
02:22:29 i don't know i don't know that's just my that's just my opinion man
02:22:37 yeah but there's there don't worry there's more there's more in bob story four we get the follow
02:22:42 home god three two one go uh to follow up then um the girl and i we kind of went on a couple
02:22:52 dates and i fingered her a few more times and like made out a couple times and then i found out
02:23:00 she was engaged and i was not okay okay okay okay these are like two very key facts that making this
02:23:10 story as terrifying as you're implying it to be and you let it kept us waiting a whole week you
02:23:15 know what you know what i think my theory holds i just kind of think she was just on the prowl
02:23:21 yeah no that definitely solidifies that yeah yeah and just uh i can imagine i can imagine
02:23:31 no maybe i'm being unfair here but but my mind goes to like
02:23:36 your guys are talking about chris chan or whatever and she's like why don't why won't this
02:23:43 why won't this homo just just finger me already
02:23:56 like she she came up to you the first time she saw your hands just like this is like hands i know
02:24:02 she complimented the only language the only language you understand the language of
02:24:06 chan is the language of sonichu i know i'll i can i can pretend that these pictures are for
02:24:16 maybe maybe if i fuck with chan he'll care and then i won't and that's the reason why i can
02:24:22 get naked and i won't look like a slaughter and as as we're posting my my my uh nudes for
02:24:32 weston chan layer onto four uh it doesn't doesn't it i understand more but at the same time i don't
02:24:42 um good story though good story next up it's tale as old as time next up is pro
02:24:51 master just like toy story three two one go hey pcp so gib is a girl now i i don't i don't
02:25:04 understand that there are no girls on the internet right like that's not a thing that's right so
02:25:11 that's true what's up with that jk uh trans rights hey well
02:25:25 you gotta cover your back i gotta be sorry i think maybe make sure there's no way maybe this guy
02:25:31 called in to be like ha ha sarcastic about like uh but then he felt like oh this kind of actually
02:25:39 just sounds like i'm like stupid so i gotta like i gotta dial back i gotta dial it back
02:25:44 can be like and be like no but actually no but actually don't don't say these things
02:25:56 it it is the unfortunateness because it ruins the punchline everything i am about to say is not
02:26:02 sincerely believed like anyway by the way a lot onto my voicemail um okay next up cross fan art is
02:26:12 based three two one go i recently got my first piece of fan art and it got me thinking about how
02:26:18 fucking based fan art is feel like you need to draw but you got artist block whoever your favorite
02:26:23 content creator is is probably a great source of inspiration make fan art want senpai to notice you
02:26:28 but they won't respond to the hundreds of comments you've left on their youtube videos tweet fan
02:26:32 art at them you want to support your favorite content creator patreon.com slash ben saint yeah
02:26:37 what you're broke well then fucking fan art this guy knows everything how is how is this guy just
02:26:43 the smartest person alive how did he do it mm-hmm i drew it's it's every every a zumi fan art i get
02:26:57 makes the projects i'm going to especially for someone who draws be complete five minutes earlier
02:27:01 than they otherwise would be because it's like an extra boost of energy yeah yeah yeah yeah that's
02:27:06 that's the whole point i can't i can't say it's too far only five minutes though i'll get two more
02:27:10 fan art and the project will be done so it's got you gotta you gotta taper that out a little bit
02:27:17 yeah yeah i need a like a few gigabytes of
02:27:21 pump i got a piece of coming in got a cop killer fan art the other day it was a it was the first

02:28:27 explain because samurai voice not good
02:28:34 hi i'm the samurai's friend um so he found your discord through an old tweet that you made in like
02:28:43 2018 maybe after you said that he was in the discord which he wasn't he went to your discord server
02:28:51 there was somebody there called actual samurai guy so the samurai sent him a dm and said hey
02:28:58 why don't you get fucked you posted a cringy picture fuck you the samurai is my character not yours
02:29:05 so that guy fucked off and now samurai committed in the discord now is the actual summer
02:29:12 i don't know why he wanted this clarified but he wanted me to do it so i'm gonna hand you back
02:29:18 we're pure now
02:29:31 make voice hard to do so samurai go forever probably but until whenever sayonara erogid
02:29:43 ah sucker he fucking he fucking forgave me for all my betrayals ah you nerd this is what i was waiting
02:29:51 for i tricked you into it i waited you out and it paid dividends i'm gonna be i'm gonna be rolling
02:30:00 in it i'm gonna i'm gonna use the power of the scroll what did they make me uh make me a millionaire
02:30:05 it's fucking nerd
02:30:11 i missed that too about something about the voice makes it difficult
02:30:16 i i some yeah i didn't hear that word he said something uh uh uh i get fucked i get fucked
02:30:24 thinking i'll return the scroll thinking i'll use doesn't even have a fucking he doesn't even

02:30:44 to do oh does that samurai trans never knew jesus
02:30:53 wait but that's not how estrogen works it doesn't change your voice you have to do that yourself
02:30:58 uh you have to do that with rigorous trace
02:31:02 maybe that's what's on the scroll is how to change that shit i don't give a fuck
02:31:13 uh swipe my ass with it when i need to let the cats hang on my toilet paper roll
02:31:18 just emergency tp you know in case of emergency a great glass kind of deal
02:31:23 no just reusable toilet paper you know it's like it's like drill drill said recently they
02:31:31 should invent toilet paper that you put in the trash instead of in the toilet i did it it's called
02:31:36 the Kawasaki clan scroll um okay so glad we've sorted that situation out uh riddle my next one
02:31:48 is from riddle my ass batman well three two one go batman here for his first weekly report
02:31:59 disney drew the body the back cave for the new amusement park they only offered five trillion
02:32:08 dollars batman was insulted so the bat took the mouse his ears took him off shut him down and
02:32:19 stroked and replaced him with bad ears such concludes the weekly report do it next time
02:32:29 same bat time same bad channel batman's a fucking psychopath
02:32:40 was it was it disney the mouse wanted to um yeah that it seemed like a little low ball
02:32:46 for price oh i thought they were gonna make that correct a bat cave attraction and they're
02:32:53 no they probably were no they were gonna have they had to buy it from batman yeah oh yeah in
02:32:57 the authentic bat cave yeah sure yeah yeah yeah yeah i probably i probably would have handled it
02:33:02 the same exact way honestly yeah completely justified it sends a message hey now's a riddle
02:33:10 my ass batman is one of the many many people who has not completed uh uh uh their uh fucking uh
02:33:18 Kickstarter uh survey uh so i can send the fucking shit in the mail incredible uh
02:33:25 uh yeah yeah for the vapors too um the uh i um it's coming up on a point because i did because
02:33:33 i did the Kickstarter so long ago um like the surveys are only available for a year and we're
02:33:39 coming up on the year and the surveys are only going to be available until the 31st so after
02:33:45 the 31st i will not be able to see anyone's like uh surveys if they want to like fill them out late
02:33:51 they will have to like message me instead of doing it via the survey which is a little inconvenient
02:33:57 but i guess what can you do so i don't know if anyone's listening and you haven't fucking done that
02:34:02 get that in uh pretty soon because the end of the month is coming up and it'll be it'll be less
02:34:07 convenient after that um okay just thought that just put just putting that out there um next one
02:34:14 is called pancakes shit gay uh three two one go hey pancakes with creators here listen i just
02:34:23 got back from taking a big fat piece of dump in my toilet just a piece and i was wondering you know
02:34:29 how sometimes like taking a shit sometimes feels even better than sex well is that gay because
02:34:35 taking a shit is like technically anal penetration yeah i mean it's not gay it's pretty gay adjacent
02:34:42 frankly it's only gay and i won't stand for it it's only gay if your your shit is the same gender
02:34:47 that you are so what so you need to know what the gender is that you ate yeah i guess that's uh
02:34:59 it's the only way to do it
02:35:04 well my shit is non-binary so i don't know what to do better not better not better not come while
02:35:12 you're shitting then or else you're else will never fucking understand uh i mean uh i don't think
02:35:23 i don't know about listen then what do you do when you go to next time you're taking a shit and
02:35:28 you just fucking come while it's happening because it just feels so good just you know just be aware
02:35:35 that yeah if you if your shit is male and so are you then it's gay and there's nothing wrong with
02:35:41 that but it's the fact of life so you know careful um three next up is pancakes physics degree problem
02:35:50 uh three two one go hey pancakes with craters here listen i know some people at pcp
02:35:59 technically have physics quote unquote degrees and i was wondering can you solve this problem
02:36:07 can an object have unlimited surface area but a limited volume why or why not and please explain
02:36:20 uh yeah there's um
02:36:25 yeah i know i know exactly i think what he might be talking about is the idea that it would it
02:36:31 it you you can always find you can always uh measure the surface area of like a an irregular
02:36:40 shape more and more finely and it would never you would never get a super completely accurate
02:36:45 measurement but you can't have it be literally infinite yeah well like um right
02:36:53 it would just take an infinite amount of time to get the next your accurate measurement wait under
02:36:58 what circumstance um like if you're going around a country and you're trying to find the exact
02:37:06 perimeter of the country um yeah it's like you could go like to the atomic level yeah i
02:37:15 suppose well by what you define as the coast and eventually you will find there's um you you can
02:37:21 infinitely like refine your measurements uh okay you guys know what a mobius strip is right
02:37:29 would you say that that is has infinite surface area
02:37:35 because like um no because you can you can't overlap the part before you measured right
02:37:44 like you can't measure the part because there's a there's a 3d thing called the Klein bottle
02:37:49 which is basically which is basically a three-dimensional mobius strip it's similarly
02:37:55 like it's it's its surface area is recursive and it does have a fixed volume it's like it's a it's
02:38:02 a finite 3d shape with a yeah a recursive mobius like surface area but no i wouldn't actually say
02:38:10 that that has infinite surface area so um i'm gonna say it has one side that's the fun part um
02:38:23 i'm gonna say no i'm gonna say no
02:38:28 you can't you can't have infinite surface area and limited volume right am i missing anything guys
02:38:38 brain teaser have i failed yeah i don't know you're though you're more physics than i am i just
02:38:46 watch fucking youtube videos i watch smart every day
02:38:53 wait wait a minute wait a minute and v source no that's stupid because what i just described like
02:39:01 an object with like a continuous surface area that wraps around a sphere does that i'm a fucking
02:39:06 moron um all right all right mr. fucking pancakes with prayers if you've got some smart ass answer
02:39:15 then i guess call in next week and we'll see if i've failed uh and if not then get the fuck out of
02:39:22 here um next up pancakes only play this if you're weak-minded you know wait wait wait i got an answer
02:39:33 unlimited surface area and uh got him oh obliterated uh okay three two one go
02:39:48 jesus christ even a two-year-old with ass burgers could know this and answer this question
02:39:55 what are you some kind of moron it's obviously gabriel's horn look it up basically
02:40:05 shit i don't want to fucking explain it just look it up um oh oh yeah i get it yeah i get it
02:40:16 it is a a 3d a three-dimensional okay well
02:40:25 yeah the the point is that like it widened it's a it's a horn that widens at the base
02:40:30 but it widens like two at a rate the asymptotically approaches
02:40:38 like bottoming out but never quite gets there oh yeah yep yep that would do it
02:40:44 yeah but how could it have limited volume if it never quite gets there just keeps going the volume
02:40:50 also keeps going right it does but it but it keeps going at a diminishing rate that um
02:40:58 what's the word what's the word that converges that converges to a finite number it doesn't
02:41:04 it doesn't approach infinity well all right yeah i've heard of it um
02:41:13 but i would i would i would ask for a robust explanation here because because because to
02:41:19 my thought process if something is going to infinity um the volume inside it there's a bunch
02:41:26 of youtube videos about it so i'm sure um you could find the answer here we go that me and you
02:41:31 could understand i've heard here we go here we go um so yeah the recipe okay imagine this um
02:41:41 i don't i don't know what a triangular number is but um the oh okay okay three the reciprocal
02:41:49 the reciprocal of powers of two right this is an infinite series of of sums you start with
02:41:57 one it's a series of fractions that you add on top of each other right you start with one over
02:42:03 one is the fraction so that has a value of one and then you add to that one over two half you add
02:42:09 to that one over four quarter add to that one eight add one sixteenth add one thirty two
02:42:15 add one sixty fourth etc etc etc and you keep going to infinity um the numbers get smaller
02:42:23 as the series goes on such that even though the series is infinite it you it does not even
02:42:30 if you continue it infinitely you don't get infinity uh uh the series continued infinitely
02:42:35 becomes two uh it converges to two so yeah the the the idea with gabriel's horn is similar in that
02:42:43 like you know the surface the the area that it is enclosing you know yeah at the wide base of it
02:42:51 that like goes out and out and out and out infinitely uh it it like moves like the the space
02:42:59 between it and the bottom it and the the asymptote is so becomes diminishes at such a rate that's
02:43:07 similarly it converges to a non-infinite number i don't i don't know if i clarify anything uh
02:43:16 i'll go to youtube maybe find some smart alec yeah oh because you're sure you're sure is
02:43:22 fuck not gonna find one here um all right uh next one a disgruntled fan three two one go
02:43:33 you know ben for being such a proud leftist icon you platform a lot of hate speech on your
02:43:39 shell it's disappointing wish you'd be a little better about vetting these things no elaboration
02:43:47 all right cool uh a couple um a couple people a couple people complained about some of the
02:44:01 voicemails last week i didn't think any of the voicemails last week were that bad honestly um
02:44:07 well they which ones i can't think exactly because i can't remember because i
02:44:12 block all of the episodes out of my mind uh um i well you know i don't know i i talked i think
02:44:22 i talked to the person that sent this voicemail afterwards and she said that like she didn't think
02:44:28 it was that big a deal so maybe i should i just kind of want to just move on from it um yeah i'm
02:44:34 not interested not interested uh next up is called sorry for those shitty ones
02:44:45 three two one go hey there pc proud boys uh just wanted to be like sorry about those
02:44:54 really shitty voicemails uh it's uh it's the ones with the metal gear stuff
02:45:03 i'm just uh this is just a preamble for my next voicemail which is gonna blow your socks off
02:45:10 it i swear it's not a meme i it's it's a genuine voice uh
02:45:16 uh fucking performance genuine voice and it's a story it's got a beginning middle and end you
02:45:23 don't need to do a preamble blow your your fucking uh decks off why is this a whole minute long
02:45:28 and this the next voicemails come guys and uh we've never we've never had a good voicemail
02:45:35 before but i think this might be this might be for real the next one's gonna be good i swear
02:45:41 okay here we go sense here we go this one's called the good one
02:45:49 three two one go baby
02:45:54 you fucking fools you idiots who could have seen this coming god damn reapered you
02:46:02 cook so boy you fucking fell for it are you fucking voice gel voice gel uh i don't know if
02:46:12 this is even worthy of voice gel this is too it was just pathetic let's move on uh yeah terrible
02:46:22 terrible um bad uh honestly i'm on the fence i'm on the fence about voice gel
02:46:30 i'm thinking about it um next up why does the quality decline sharply several seconds in
02:46:39 three two one go a few moments later this guy sucks should we just cut this voicemail it sucks
02:46:45 really bad yeah i don't want it all right yeah i i'm okay with that ellie is our uh ellie is our
02:46:52 cut that voicemail but leave in this part where i'm saying cut that voicemail fuck that last guy
02:46:57 all right uh yeah um next one is called not worthy of a response frankly disgusting quit
02:47:06 watching our show um next one is called communism from someone who experienced it
02:47:14 oh boy three two one go okay so i cringe every fucking time you fucking dumb americans think
02:47:25 oh communism this i'm gonna suck the dick of communism it's so good it's so fair when we
02:47:32 here in eastern europe we've lived under communism for like almost a hundred years and it was the
02:47:37 worst thing ever it killed everyone and it's fucking yeah it killed everyone in the ass okay yeah he's
02:47:44 right and it slowed down our progress like a hundred years we still have medieval villages
02:47:53 until fucking now it's stupid it's like okay maybe america's brand of communism would be better now
02:48:02 with the power of handsight of we even have a brand of communism not really a tiny it's just a tiny
02:48:08 subset of people we're like really far left i love the other one but god fucking damn i always
02:48:17 always cringe when you guys like invoke oh i love the russian national anthem the so who
02:48:28 hate them i hope i that's that are still alive that have a heart attack right now
02:48:34 they are literally i wait who who's who's hitler i i i it's always the same like the people who
02:48:42 don't know what they're fucking talking about have in their head the idea of what a leftist is and
02:48:47 what they believe and they think that is what they're talking to whenever any one of us has any some
02:48:54 like they don't think about what we're saying they think of what the the the label of leftist means
02:48:58 to them and what they've heard and they ascribe it to it like nobody has ever talked about the
02:49:04 fucking russian national anthem maybe yeah i feel like he doesn't know anything about what
02:49:09 communism would actually mean i think i mean not to uh boy i i i i feel like you really need to go
02:49:18 into this i feel like this is like an open up a whole can of words i feel like maybe i i don't
02:49:22 want to go into the specifics but i want to address this the mindset and i i feel like i might be
02:49:26 accused of um i don't know west explaining this or something to uh you know this guy is like hey i was
02:49:34 i'm in a fucking eastern country uh we experienced communism this guy is probably like 20 so
02:49:40 probably not but whatever um uh is it what what does it mean what does it mean that like
02:49:48 communism like fucked up our development and no the what would probably fucked up the development
02:49:55 of whatever country this guy is in um was probably the ussr the ussr like supported its
02:50:04 surrounding you know eastern bloc countries but it was beset at the same time by the rest of the
02:50:09 world the capitalist world which you know sought to destroy it at every turn and i don't know i
02:50:15 kind of feel like maybe that might have had something to do with it i don't think this guy
02:50:18 has really considered uh all the possibilities here uh for the reasons behind what he describes
02:50:25 as the ills of communism uh i don't know this guy just kind of seems like he's being dogmatic
02:50:32 i think i think it's it's it's like there's you could say that a capitalist um surge is good for
02:50:44 like getting a good strong foothold and then you're the most powerful country in the world um
02:50:51 and then from that you can become communist and then give your people what they need but it comes
02:50:57 down a lot to like just having the right resources in the country like america had a lot of stuff you
02:51:03 know it's really it's really hard it's i mean it's hard to like put any of us there like
02:51:10 neat bow on really educated enough right about the political theory to make a like educated
02:51:16 response to this in terms of the effects and causal links between communism and like capitalist
02:51:21 pushback it's true eastern europe it's true but at the same time i don't think any of us are
02:51:26 fucking tanky yeah we're here singing the praises of communist russia just because you want social
02:51:31 reform in america and are not exactly pleased with what capitalism is doing like i don't think
02:51:37 anyone here is saying we need hardcore need like Stalinist socialism you know like i would be perfectly
02:51:44 happy with some tax reforms uh to fucking bring the rich back in line yeah like close some loopholes
02:51:52 and shit so people i i don't know if this guy is is like this but some people get yeah some people
02:51:59 get offended get uppity get like weird about it when you even suggest like what if we tax the rich
02:52:05 more and they act like that's Stalin style siege socialism in and of itself uh i mean there's a
02:52:13 discussion yeah there doesn't need to be a fucking jumping down everybody else's throat you know like
02:52:18 there are pros and cons to doing that i i just have to weigh them against each other and just have
02:52:22 a discussion and figure it out i just want to say i think i think that you know the the legacy the
02:52:29 legacy of communism it's so i feel like there's a very difficult web of like causations there and
02:52:35 i think it's probably really hard to entangle like you know which what what misfortunes were you
02:52:42 know the fault of communism itself versus what was the what was caused by like deprivation created
02:52:48 by like you know sanctions and or military action from the disapproving you know capitalist rest of
02:52:54 the world and to just you know to just blanketly say like oh yeah communism ruined everything it's
02:53:00 like no it's never that simple even if that's that's and that's me being charitable uh to this
02:53:08 interpretation of history which i'm willing to i'm willing to be charitable uh fuck man uh um
02:53:16 hail hail Stalin uh uh uh hail the ussr uh disavow disavow disavow um uh um what's a what's a
02:53:26 communist thing to say um guillotines i don't know just i just i just want people to fucking
02:53:33 listen to the things we say and then respond to that instead of the things to be fair i think
02:53:38 that the line about um the russian he might have been talking about like maybe the left
02:53:43 generally and not us specifically because surely none of us have ever been like i love the russian
02:53:49 but like like the left generally is such a the the left generally is not general there's so many
02:53:56 different things i'm not saying that it's a group yeah i'm not saying it's it's fair but yeah uh yeah
02:54:03 okay have we be specific for fuck's sake have we have we have we have we successfully obliterated
02:54:10 capitalism once and for all uh nice shut up no no it's still too powerful no no no we're gonna
02:54:19 we got it we got it it's gone now um next one is troll jester mgs this is stupid i'm sorry
02:54:28 okay three two one go miller what's gotten into you snake they aren't real what they aren't real
02:54:40 poor people aren't real i've never seen one you've never seen one i can't be i'm blind snake
02:54:48 get it i'm blind the sunglasses i you're not blind what master miller isn't blind you
02:54:56 are fucking moron have you even played the games you lost your arm i knew that snake look
02:55:03 that was a test i wanted to make sure you were the real snake what are you even talking about
02:55:08 i've never uh felt the poor they aren't real snake uh snake it's me a parole throat i'm in this too
02:55:21 it's you it's me yes hello what are you doing snake listen don't listen to him he's a liar snake
02:55:31 don't listen to him he's also a liar like me i can tell what other liars are around
02:55:36 that's bullshit fuck you listen i've got some keycard bullshit to deal with i'll get in contact
02:55:41 with you later okay it's like i'm there say it's the last second it's like i'm there
02:55:55 it's like a it's like a proto it's like a proto one but later
02:56:00 uh
02:56:07 it's good excellent uh okay all right all right simmer down uh next next one we've got is called
02:56:15 canned tent uh three two one ago hey everybody and welcome to another episode of canned tan
02:56:24 canned tan we just watched a fucking terrible anime it's a really bad anime and i don't care
02:56:32 about it at all listen to me talk about how much i don't care for 45 minutes there's just way too
02:56:37 much going on in the plot there's a lot of talking and there are more than two things happening at
02:56:41 once that's too much that bores me and because it's boring i don't care at all and because i don't
02:56:46 care i'm not going to pay attention which will cause me to miss extremely obvious plot details
02:56:51 i'm not misunderstanding because i'm stupid or anything it's just that the show is not good
02:56:56 if it was just a good show i would understand it very well because i am a smart person it's hard
02:57:01 to understand and the author made it that way because the author is autistic i don't understand
02:57:05 the story at all but i completely understand the kind of person the author is and their creative
02:57:09 process well that's going to do it for this week's episode of canned tan
02:57:20 i believe i believe this was uh uh
02:57:25 now now i'm now i'm not i'm not i don't watch i don't watch canton but uh i heard people saying
02:57:33 that the re-zero episode made a lot of people angry did you guys hear anything about this
02:57:40 i heard nothing i i haven't heard i i don't watch because i don't care about the anime but like
02:57:48 i i totally believe that this is what's happening because it seems it seems very realistic yeah
02:57:53 yeah it does in particular it's like it's like i was there in in particular it was i i heard people
02:57:58 saying that the re-zero episode they just kind of like didn't understand the plot and like
02:58:09 people were like why are you talking about the show you're criticizing the show i mean
02:58:13 but you like didn't understand it and you are like factually wrong about some things i mean
02:58:18 that's the biggest nightmare for any person who talks about media is is to be stupid live on screen
02:58:26 is to is to is to have missed something obvious and talked with authority i i i have nightmares
02:58:33 of doing that myself i've probably done it hundreds of times because i i just i'm not aware it would
02:58:40 be it would be pretty embarrassing that's that much i i can uh i can agree with uh well uh canned
02:58:50 thanks for your thanks for your voicemail uh fuck yeah next one is called ben is racist
02:58:58 uh oh oh oh boy three it's about time this was brought to life three two one go say it say it
02:59:07 say white lives matter if you're not a racist say it say it now oh god i mean i mean i mean i mean
02:59:15 i mean i mean white lives do matter got got right a little bit right like i mean yeah they
02:59:21 matter too right but ben you just have to say all lives matter you cover everybody i mean i mean
02:59:26 all lives all lives don't matter you don't live still matter though it's right yeah you come on
02:59:33 you know it's like uh fuck no it's all right he's right i'm racist i'll i feel like i should
02:59:41 just say the thing the black lives matter is not about black lives matter more is because society
02:59:49 does not generally deem them to matter in western society it feels it feels the need to be said
02:59:55 therefore it is a thing that people say do you ever do you ever feel like the left has a language
03:00:00 problem do you ever feel like the left makes up makes a lot of terms that are seems to be inherently
03:00:04 difficult for people to understand it's not inherently difficult for people to understand
03:00:08 they're just not trying to understand i feel like i mean it's not like is sloganable but if
03:00:13 like it had been if the movement had been called black lives matter too we wouldn't have this
03:00:17 conversation because it would have been implied in this yeah then now that would have saved would
03:00:21 have saved us all collectively hundreds of hours that one is fair enough i have always thought that
03:00:25 but i also don't think that at this point people can can be allowed to just still not get it it's
03:00:32 been so all over but i'm just saying if only if only we had known and could have
03:00:37 proactively corrected this problem from the very beginning um i don't know i i i wonder if like
03:00:44 would would like tweaking the phrasing a little bit like really have made that much of a difference
03:00:50 or would i think the people i think the people with the people with the problem with it had just
03:00:55 have a problem anyway they just wouldn't i think they would have found another problem but i think
03:00:59 there are probably a significant amount of people who don't understand who probably once
03:01:03 explained like oh i get it now and those people would have been saved yeah or the very least the
03:01:09 people who are on the fence who were convinced by the people who acting in bad faith would never
03:01:14 have had that that avenue to be swayed in the first place i think it's just sort of like if if
03:01:20 someone were to say the statement black lives matter and your responses like not yeah of course
03:01:27 if your response is defensive then there's something up i mean i know i know a lot of white
03:01:33 people myself included initially was like what about white people um but that's because i yeah i
03:01:41 don't have the i don't have this perspective i do now that's that's that's entirely that's entirely
03:01:46 my point but like i don't know i learned i learned this here's wasn't that difficult here's but
03:01:51 you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna go i'm gonna move past that honestly yeah i think those sure
03:01:58 like out and out racists who are like uh don't say black lives matter that's uh why you why you
03:02:03 politicize why you gotta bring race into it or whatever like yeah fuck that um but i think i
03:02:10 think there is a more insidious the more insidious problem is the is the guy who's like you're like
03:02:17 okay black lives matter and he's like yeah yeah sure yeah black lives matter yeah yeah of course
03:02:20 yeah equality black people and then you're like okay okay uh you know therefore outlines a bunch
03:02:26 of like progressive policy ideas like you know defunding the police uh or whatever uh you know
03:02:32 funding social welfare programs instead of over policing uh you know decriminalizing marijuana
03:02:38 so on and so forth and then they're like whoa whoa whoa i thought this was just about black lives
03:02:44 you know being equal now you're trying to do well now you're trying to sneak in all this Marxist
03:02:48 shit on me i think that's the real sticking point i i think that's the that's the thing yeah it does
03:02:55 come from the same place that's like a bigger hump where it's just they don't have the perspective
03:03:00 to understand that in order to make sure black lives are treated equally these things need to change
03:03:07 like like a like a conservative will agree like they'll say like yeah yeah yeah black people are
03:03:13 just as invaluable as white people black lives matter just as much and then you're like okay well
03:03:20 here's how you know on the whole you know people of color and such are you know disadvantaged
03:03:27 you know the you know wealth and equality is a big problem over policing is a big problem crime
03:03:33 criminality is you know is not a uniformly enforced and then they'll be like okay okay okay yeah but
03:03:41 i mean that's just kind of like uh human nature or something like uh like yeah but you can't like
03:03:45 do anything about that right like share black lives matter but like you can't like do anything
03:03:51 about that's just like the way the world works that's just like uh and you know maybe they
03:03:54 shouldn't commit those crimes that you know we convict them for more more vigorously than
03:04:00 than other other people you know what i'm saying i do yeah um i think is there's a there's a there's
03:04:08 i don't know it's what you say insidious i say that it is it's it's for people who have like more
03:04:16 insidious um goals they act like that and then there are people who just act like that because
03:04:22 they don't think about it at all which is an unfortunate double those people that i just
03:04:28 described are convinced that they are the real not racists right that like redistributive wealth
03:04:37 is like a racist thing like that's the real racism or something and that makes me so bad
03:04:46 it's like you know that that like affirmative action is like the real racism or whatever i don't
03:04:51 know it's very it's i'm getting mad just thinking about it um uh i feel like i was gonna say oh i was
03:04:57 gonna say uh you say you know think about the left having a language problem i think that to a certain
03:05:03 extent i would agree the black lives matter like yeah i guess i see how like it's a little like
03:05:09 maybe if you don't think about it it's like well that's kind of a weird you know
03:05:13 another thing is like only black lives oh no you don't mean that okay uh i misunderstood another
03:05:19 example would be like um what is it private property versus personal property yeah that's a
03:05:26 whole that's a big fucking problem like imagine all the memes that could have been avoided if we
03:05:31 didn't use language like that yeah with me i mean mark said i didn't use that language at all but
03:05:35 you know what i mean like there's just there's tons of small little examples like that um throughout
03:05:40 like like like language on the left that i feel like when you went if you're not into politics at all
03:05:46 if you're like completely apolitical yeah uh and you stumble upon a lot of this phrasing like abolish
03:05:52 private property like what the fuck that sounds stupid but like you'd have to have like someone
03:05:56 who's like knowledge sit down and explain all this like preamble to you and like we we just had a
03:06:01 very bad reaction at preamble so i'm sure people who have had to live politics feel similarly it
03:06:07 just seems like really poor language choices on a lot of key issues fucked a lot of this shit up
03:06:13 yeah i i think that i agree but on the same time i wonder like to what extent was it like
03:06:19 poor phrasing versus like to what extent has it been like to what extent has the phrasing like
03:06:27 been poisons on purpose well i mean it took me forever to realize that private property and
03:06:35 personal property were different among people who are talking about like marks yeah i didn't know that
03:06:40 forever yeah because as someone who just listened to it i'm like abolish private property that seems
03:06:45 like it would cause a lot of issues i i feel like if like maybe uh i don't know just um just
03:06:51 thinking that lab maybe not capitalism's biggest fan so it's not like i was like pulling for the
03:06:55 other team or anything it just like on the face of it based on like casual vernacular that sounds
03:07:00 really bad i just i maybe if maybe if like i don't know the educational system were more
03:07:08 because like you know i grew the orthodoxy that i was taught growing up was that you know the free
03:07:13 market corrects for itself and and all that stuff all this neoliberal like a voodoo and um
03:07:21 someone just fucking subscribed or something i don't know um and uh so that but then you know what
03:07:28 one wonders if maybe one wonders if maybe the the we were taught a more like a more genuinely like
03:07:34 neutral perspective or a more balanced perspective maybe we would know the different because a lot
03:07:39 of people don't know the difference but like you know that we have a public education system
03:07:44 is supposed to educate us and make sure we know things i mean i feel like that's one thing that
03:07:49 maybe could be you know that's i mean i would agree with that to to a point but like i would
03:07:55 also say that like this entire like group of people on the left are operating under the assumption
03:08:00 that we live in a system that is very skewed so if you're making an excuse for like well the system
03:08:06 should be better so we're gonna explain how the system is bad like it just seems like self-defeating
03:08:11 but you have to be operating with language using the the kind of like framework that we're already
03:08:17 established in otherwise you're kind of just tacking on like understanding our problem to
03:08:23 the list of problems you're trying to fix which seems like circular i think that's a fair point
03:08:27 i agree you have to you have to meet people where they are but like i don't know there's a lot of
03:08:33 very i don't know whether they're easy to get into but there's plenty of videos now that explain
03:08:39 these things that people can link to i think on some level people just need to be open to different
03:08:47 ideas on the whole i mean yeah like if you want if you want to dive down a rabbit hole of learning
03:08:56 about this stuff like it's it's very easy to do but um you know i'm getting someone getting someone to
03:09:04 to accept like thinking about it for a little bit is the hardest part and i guess yeah the language
03:09:10 problem is is you know it's it exists i guess i i guess i i can't disagree um next voicemail
03:09:22 let's do it next how many more do we have only like four only three more three more only 46 only 14
03:09:30 no no we're almost done uh uh this one's called fuck them three two one go look the circumcision
03:09:39 is an operation carried out on infants it's done without their consent it's done without
03:09:44 anesthetic it's unnecessary it's a cosmetic operation that's what it is you shouldn't
03:09:51 need to do such a thing routinely to an infant and there is no reason it was invented by this guy
03:09:57 who wanted to stop people from masturbating how fucked up is that yeah it sure will be hard to
03:10:03 jack off when your dick is fucking dry yeah it's fine actually it works so sad it's sad that people
03:10:10 defend it oh yeah like my dick works fine sure sure but your rights were violated dude what the
03:10:19 fuck stop defending it i'm you know i'm religious reasons call me the fucking circumcision defender
03:10:25 i'm circumcision biggest fan now dude it's my belief i think we should just cut our heads off at birth
03:10:30 you know it doesn't make it okay your stupid backwards bullshit doesn't justify your crimes
03:10:37 your violations of people's rights fuck you uh fuck circumcision fuck people who defend it
03:10:45 and fuck doctors who perform it is this that same guy who made wait is this the guy who did
03:10:54 the voicemail that we cut because it was terrible no it was a different guy this guy that's a different
03:11:01 okay okay i mean i agree i don't think circumcision is defendable um you can argue that it's like
03:11:09 good or bad but i don't think it's it's good that you can you can do that to a child because there's
03:11:14 no way they could possibly consent to such a thing i'm gonna play devil's advocate here for a second
03:11:21 whoa holy fuck the tables have turned um i mean i mean i think that um it's not look i i don't know
03:11:31 i don't know everything but like i've seen the arguments that i've seen are like that it's not
03:11:35 just a cosmetic operation it's like a sanitary operation and like circum if you're circumcised
03:11:42 you have like a reduced chance of like uh you know uh various diseases developing and also
03:11:48 it like it lowers the transmission rate of of various stds and uh things like that
03:11:56 and i don't know maybe maybe that if that's true maybe it would convince you and maybe it wouldn't
03:12:00 but like i don't know if well here's the thing if in fact if let me finish if there is like a if
03:12:06 there is like a sanitary or like a medical reason to do it i don't think that like the oh they didn't
03:12:11 consent argument holds water because like you give a kid a vaccine without their consent you know
03:12:18 because like the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and it's because if this kid didn't have the vaccine
03:12:23 then not only would it hurt not only is it best for the kid it's best for all of society if you
03:12:30 know everyone's getting the vaccine it's good for everyone and i think that you could probably make
03:12:34 a similar argument if in fact there are medical benefits to circumcision as i have heard argue
03:12:38 that there are right but nobody someone would argue in response that like a vaccine isn't like
03:12:44 permanently disfiguring and yeah anyone like vaccines do not have a drawback in the same way
03:12:52 that circumcision does i mean does it though dude they give you autism that's the drawback
03:12:59 circumcision does fuck i mean that explains well obviously i can't i can't speak to someone who is
03:13:08 circumcised circumcised because i'm not but there is no sanitary bullshit it's very very easy to
03:13:14 keep it clean it's never made any sense like i really hate the the people who talk about that
03:13:21 when they don't you know they don't have one they don't know it's not a problem that you just wash
03:13:27 it like you wash any part of your body okay uh ben from the future here so i am a fool and i fucked
03:13:37 up and my audacity i ran out of disk space so it stopped recording right in the middle of this
03:13:43 conversation this conversation made me pretty mad uh because nobody fucking uh it's all it's all
03:13:51 gib being like oh but but oh the baby didn't have a choice or the the the what why would you cut a
03:13:59 baby and i'm just i'm i just think that we should follow the science and if i'm just i'm merely open
03:14:07 to the possibility that if you know we're widely practicing circumcision were to significantly cause
03:14:17 some sort of significant societal benefit like say a reduction in the transmission of std's for
03:14:21 instance uh uh you know without any with that without significance or with without you know
03:14:28 a commensurate negative thing because like you know everyone says oh you mutilated oh it's a party
03:14:33 because like okay well so is your appendix uh but you know sometimes you got to cut that out
03:14:38 sometimes you're better off without it uh it doesn't necessarily do anything uh let's not let's not
03:14:43 fall into the trap of the naturalistic fallacy here um so sorry you won't get to hear any of that
03:14:50 but i've summarized it for you i was right i'm always i'm on top of it um okay back sorry goodbye
03:14:59 back to the show all right well let's let's finish this episode as soon as possible right now um
