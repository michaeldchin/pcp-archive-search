00:00:00 Starting now.
00:00:02 Routy.
00:00:04 Fuckers, top killers.
00:00:06 That was so bad then.
00:00:08 This is such an inauspicious start.
00:00:10 The start of the new era that is
00:00:12 RCK is exclusively live action now.
00:00:14 I'm in the room with you.
00:00:16 I'm tucking your leg right now. How's it feel?
00:00:18 I'm on the inside of your leg right now. How's it feel?
00:00:20 Can you describe what I'm doing to you?
00:00:22 Oh my god, can I stick my finger up there?
00:00:24 Oh let's see.
00:00:26 You made me scream and that's bad.
00:00:28 It's bad and rude.
00:00:30 Listen, we gotta start this intro right.
00:00:32 That's by cracking open a new energy drink.
00:00:34 To ward off all these serpents.
00:00:36 I just want to say that Rockstar Exdurance
00:00:38 is one of my favorites.
00:00:40 And we found, we're at the store.
00:00:42 And we found
00:00:44 the new marshmallow flavor.
00:00:46 Which fucks me right up.
00:00:48 We're opening up marshmallow.
00:00:50 And I just want to say what you said.
00:00:52 All of these have the exact same caffeine level.
00:00:54 My worry.
00:00:56 My worry is that it's just going to taste like cotton candy.
00:00:58 All these have the exact same caffeine level.
00:01:00 But this is exclusively the marshmallow flavor.
00:01:02 We want to emphasize the fact that it has
00:01:04 300 milligrams of caffeine
00:01:06 for some reason.
00:01:10 There's a hand.
00:01:12 Holding out a little crystal skull
00:01:14 from behind us.
00:01:16 There are various thoughts lying in the room right now.
00:01:18 We have to ward them off.
00:01:20 By handing out some of our...
00:01:22 No do this.
00:01:24 We're all going to take a shot.
00:01:26 No wait.
00:01:28 I don't have a glass.
00:01:30 Whatever.
00:01:32 One, two, three.
00:01:34 It's like nerds.
00:01:36 It is very much like cotton candy.
00:01:38 I think it just tastes like nerds.
00:01:40 It's bad.
00:01:42 I wouldn't say it's bad.
00:01:44 But I don't like it as much as the cotton candy.
00:01:46 You know what it tastes like cream soda?
00:01:48 It does.
00:01:50 I like it.
00:01:52 I don't like it as much as the cotton candy.
00:01:54 It's very low carbonated.
00:01:56 It's very soft.
00:01:58 It's vegan.
00:02:00 Sure.
00:02:02 What does that mean?
00:02:04 No.
00:02:06 I just got a little bit of a bitter aftertaste.
00:02:08 I'm going to pour some more for the thoughts.
00:02:10 Dude it's vegan.
00:02:12 Do this.
00:02:14 You gotta hang out every time.
00:02:16 Drink some.
00:02:18 No, it's for her.
00:02:20 I had some.
00:02:22 Are you done?
00:02:24 Rockstar X-Durance.
00:02:26 I really like the can design.
00:02:28 It's all white.
00:02:30 It's all start white except for the X in X-Durance.
00:02:32 And the giant 300.
00:02:34 As in 300 milligrams of caffeine.
00:02:36 God.
00:02:38 I love graphic design.
00:02:40 Why does anyone even bother with drawing or making art?
00:02:42 When you can just do graphic design
00:02:44 for literally no effort and achieve 100% of the effect.
00:02:46 You know what I do like?
00:02:48 There are some energy drinks
00:02:50 that are more of the high end variety
00:02:52 of the less just straight up.
00:02:54 Oh we're playing cookie clear by the way.
00:02:56 But that doesn't matter.
00:02:58 It won't matter if the entirety of this.
00:03:00 In fact we won't even commentate on it at all.
00:03:02 But I like some of the energy drinks that are more like
00:03:04 soft to drink.
00:03:06 The more refined, less just straight acidic
00:03:08 bubbly carbonated to hell.
00:03:10 There are more like
00:03:12 I don't know if science was like that.
00:03:14 I was in Michigan the other day.
00:03:16 I was eating onions energy drinks.
00:03:18 And they were very very
00:03:20 refined drinks for like a sophisticated
00:03:22 man on the move.
00:03:24 Guys you can't talk
00:03:26 when we're recording an audio only show.
00:03:28 You can't just pretend as though
00:03:30 the audience can't-
00:03:32 I love to like that.
00:03:34 You out.
00:03:36 Get out.
00:03:38 I totally cook gonna give cookies.
00:03:40 I was literally trying to get her to stop talking.
00:03:42 I'm not kidding.
00:03:44 But we can't be having parallel conversations.
00:03:46 That's why I said, shh.
00:03:48 I closed that shit.
00:03:51 You can come back later.
00:03:53 No, you can't.
00:03:53 You can.
00:03:54 No, I think your guys are welcome.
00:03:56 I can't sustain an entire show on my own.
00:03:59 Well, I'm leaving in half an hour.
00:04:03 So I can be on the first half hour of this episode
00:04:05 and then leave.
00:04:08 Why are you leaving in half an hour?
00:04:09 Because I want to make dinner and do some work to do.
00:04:12 OK.
00:04:13 I'm fucking around like you guys.
00:04:16 Listen, this isn't fucking up.
00:04:17 This is a historic moment.
00:04:18 This isn't fucking up.
00:04:20 This isn't going the wayside.
00:04:21 This isn't, you know, veering off God's path.
00:04:24 This is exactly what's in accordance with God's plan.
00:04:27 Ben, it's crazy, right?
00:04:29 God's plan?
00:04:29 Dude, I love that wisdom.
00:04:31 I'm here.
00:04:32 I'm here in Boston.
00:04:33 I will be here forever.
00:04:34 I've moved here.
00:04:35 There's nothing I can do.
00:04:37 I'm a surf shackled to my land.
00:04:38 I'm legally bowed to my land.
00:04:41 I'm not able to move away.
00:04:42 I'm going to die 30 feet away from where I was born, Ben.
00:04:46 That's the system we live in.
00:04:47 That's the dream.
00:04:50 OK, how do you feel about all that?
00:04:52 Great.
00:04:53 Doesn't that feel like just yesterday?
00:04:54 Did you just get mad at me if you're going to college?
00:04:57 It feels like it was such a far away dream.
00:04:59 But now things have progressed so fast.
00:05:02 I mean, I'm just, we've, OK, PCB HQ, right,
00:05:08 talked about for like literal years.
00:05:10 I mean, depending on how you want to count it,
00:05:11 PCB HQ could be its first thought of a prelude to it.
00:05:15 It was just going to be Tom and Digi.
00:05:17 Like 2013, 14 at latest.
00:05:20 Like fucking so, like a half a decade of the promise
00:05:24 of that kind of group of getting together.
00:05:27 Me and you, we don't give a shit about any of that.
00:05:30 No, in fact, I hate them.
00:05:32 We're RFCK and we don't need any fucking one.
00:05:34 We don't need anyone.
00:05:35 Let's, we're going to burn all the bridges.
00:05:36 This is going to be a repeat of Ben's stream from yesterday,
00:05:39 temporarily, late to us, however, not related to you.
00:05:42 I have no idea this is going to come out.
00:05:43 That's what I do, just shit on everyone.
00:05:45 That's my thing.
00:05:46 Everyone sucks.
00:05:47 It's, it's glorious.
00:05:48 It's literally fantastic.
00:05:50 Hey, you know who else we saw?
00:05:52 You know who else sucks?
00:05:53 Well, you and me.
00:05:55 Well, well, the combination of, you know,
00:05:57 who else, and also who we saw in person early
00:05:59 when we were at Burning Con.
00:06:01 All of you who are listening to this, probably most of them,
00:06:05 a little bit of them, we've got such a spirit.
00:06:07 Our entire audience was there.
00:06:10 It felt like, didn't it?
00:06:11 It felt like we had like a mass of people.
00:06:13 Sit back a little bit.
00:06:14 You're, you're, you're noticeably louder than me.
00:06:16 Okay. Well, then I will get back.
00:06:18 So we can fix that by just you not leaning in.
00:06:20 And I think it'll be fine.
00:06:21 Okay. It felt like at Burning Con,
00:06:24 like just a tidal wave of people showed up
00:06:27 that we're just coming over to see RFCK.
00:06:30 People I didn't genuinely believe were real.
00:06:32 Yeah. There were a bunch of people like from all,
00:06:34 like across the spectrum of like old veterans
00:06:37 who you would like, you know, you hear the name
00:06:39 and you shudder and your ass whole quakes
00:06:40 and you just want to receive back in the recesses of your mind.
00:06:43 You're too scared of the girth and impressive mic
00:06:46 they may have and like fucking, you know, literally who's.
00:06:50 That's right.
00:06:53 And it was a great time.
00:06:54 It was so nice. I want to shout out.
00:06:56 I have them right here.
00:06:56 I want to give Levy Jevy a shout out
00:06:58 for giving me these sweet communist pins.
00:07:01 I haven't had a chance to wear them out in public yet,
00:07:04 but it'll happen.
00:07:05 I don't know if this is like private information,
00:07:07 but you know what? I don't care.
00:07:09 Slimehouse, which is what the Airbnb was called,
00:07:11 where all the RFCK guys hung out,
00:07:13 all the RCK fans hung out.
00:07:16 Quote unquote.
00:07:16 Quote unquote fans of quote unquote RFCK.
00:07:21 They're thinking about like moving here to Boston as well,
00:07:24 like getting a house together to live together.
00:07:27 Boy, how wacky.
00:07:28 That would be insane.
00:07:29 Like it would be insane.
00:07:31 Everything related to RCK.
00:07:34 I've said this before,
00:07:35 but my house is literally that.
00:07:38 My house was,
00:07:39 my house that I live in was formed by a bunch of guys
00:07:42 who knew each other from an internet forum.
00:07:44 RCK is just like PCP, but good.
00:07:48 That's all it is.
00:07:49 That's all it's ever been.
00:07:50 That's all that will ever be.
00:07:51 The absolute astonishing raid that has gone from like,
00:07:56 you know, just like these fans,
00:07:58 like just got so like into RCK
00:08:00 that they were able to, you know,
00:08:01 convince themselves to go across the country
00:08:04 and wherever they fuck they lived.
00:08:05 Go to Baltimore to go to Bronicon and to live together.
00:08:08 And now they're still like submitting
00:08:10 with the idea of living together
00:08:11 from like a fucking weekend.
00:08:12 They're just like actually thinking about moving here.
00:08:15 We smote them.
00:08:16 And this isn't just like a ha ha funny idea.
00:08:17 I mean, obviously it might not happen.
00:08:18 You know, nothing's been signed.
00:08:20 Nothing's official.
00:08:20 But like they're looking at houses.
00:08:22 They're genuine about it.
00:08:23 They're genuine about their interest at least.
00:08:25 And it's fucking crazy.
00:08:26 You leaving?
00:08:28 Oh.
00:08:28 Am I leaving the house?
00:08:29 Oh, I thought you were coming in here to say something.
00:08:31 No, I just came in to see what you were talking about.
00:08:33 Oh.
00:08:34 Do a slime house.
00:08:35 Do a slime house.
00:08:36 If you live in a hellhole and you hate it.
00:08:40 Yeah.
00:08:41 Then leave.
00:08:42 Then do it.
00:08:43 You have people.
00:08:44 Try just being richer.
00:08:46 Have you tried?
00:08:47 Have you considered picking yourself up
00:08:48 by your bootstraps, you fools?
00:08:49 Who seems like they could like support,
00:08:51 they can help support you.
00:08:53 Not like you're mooching off them.
00:08:55 But who seems responsible?
00:08:57 It's not your parents.
00:08:58 It's not your friends.
00:08:59 It's not your church.
00:09:00 It's AJ Xu.
00:09:01 It's AJ Xu.
00:09:01 Yeah.
00:09:02 You should definitely leech off of AJ.
00:09:04 It's AJ Xu up in a frame.
00:09:05 You can't get the door open.
00:09:06 We're screaming.
00:09:07 You can't do this.
00:09:08 Sorry.
00:09:09 You could close the door.
00:09:10 Yeah, you could.
00:09:11 Can you talk it?
00:09:12 She's going.
00:09:17 No, that's AJ Xu up in a frame.
00:09:19 I trust you.
00:09:20 Okay.
00:09:22 Not me though.
00:09:23 I don't.
00:09:24 Who we trust?
00:09:25 We don't.
00:09:26 That's not our endorsement.
00:09:28 But it's just so crazy to think that like,
00:09:31 it's magical, right?
00:09:32 It's fucking magical.
00:09:33 I don't want to have any reservation, my voice.
00:09:36 I want to have anything that is an absolute hubris.
00:09:40 RFCK is like the best thing to happen to anyone.
00:09:43 To anyone's life.
00:09:44 To anyone that, it doesn't even know where RFCK is.
00:09:46 Their life's just been tangentially benefited
00:09:48 from us existing.
00:09:50 Think about all the, okay, listen.
00:09:52 People like Conman, they're going to shoot up a school.
00:09:54 Listen, they were so impressed when they met RFCK.
00:09:57 They were so like on the verge of so,
00:09:59 like they were like acceleration-ness before they
00:10:02 went to New Los Angeles to be educated and Milwaukee.
00:10:04 Where it's all, things have already been accelerated.
00:10:05 Yeah, it's the end of history.
00:10:08 Yeah, the philosophy is not even needed
00:10:09 because it just is the case constantly.
00:10:12 You put it into practice.
00:10:13 And we made them normal.
00:10:15 And by normal, I mean bloodthirsty,
00:10:17 slime-thirsty gangsters who roam the streets
00:10:19 looking for children to kill.
00:10:22 It's incredible.
00:10:23 It's incredible.
00:10:24 We've done so much good for the world.
00:10:26 Dude, we fucked that shit up.
00:10:28 High five.
00:10:29 Dude.
00:10:30 High hoof, bro.
00:10:31 It hurts.
00:10:32 It hurts me.
00:10:34 Dude, BronyCon was so cool.
00:10:36 It was pretty good.
00:10:36 Hanging out with, you know, okay,
00:10:37 I've said before I've said it again,
00:10:39 RFCK has like the best fan base,
00:10:41 like I've ever been a part of.
00:10:43 Like, out of like, out of like, even real ones too.
00:10:47 I mean, a part of it is like-
00:10:47 Which I was a fan.
00:10:49 You know what?
00:10:50 How good would it be to like sit back and, you know,
00:10:52 do nothing coast on the victories of me and you, Ben,
00:10:55 and just, you know, pretend as though they have
00:10:57 some semblance of ownership to the game.
00:10:59 Oh, they populated, they talk a lot.
00:11:02 Nah, they'd be so fucking easy.
00:11:03 Sad.
00:11:04 Literally.
00:11:05 Disgusting.
00:11:06 Sounds like the life.
00:11:08 But anyway, again, I fucking, like,
00:11:11 part of the benefit of RFCK is that it's so like,
00:11:14 small of like an endeavor, right?
00:11:16 So it's like you're almost forced to like, be cool,
00:11:18 or also be expelled and cyberbullied
00:11:21 for how bad of a person you are.
00:11:23 And it's great.
00:11:24 It just breeds like, genuine people who I think are like,
00:11:27 I would actually consider my friends.
00:11:28 Be like a coffin of frame.
00:11:29 Like, I love those guys.
00:11:30 Like, I actually like them, you know?
00:11:33 They're cool and I like them.
00:11:34 So, Bronecon, like everything related to Bronecon
00:11:38 was a nightmare and I kind of like hated it
00:11:40 and it was a nightmare.
00:11:42 But like Slimehouse, just like going away from the con,
00:11:46 you know, not dealing with like whatever fucking,
00:11:49 you know, autistic shit was happening over there
00:11:51 and not having to walk around in the blistering
00:11:53 Baltimore humidity.
00:11:54 Just being able to go back to Slimehouse,
00:11:56 hang out with people, talk, you know,
00:11:58 maybe party for a day, maybe just real talk for a day.
00:12:02 It was glorious.
00:12:03 It was absolutely incredible.
00:12:04 And I've never felt so at home in a community.
00:12:07 And you know what?
00:12:08 It's beautiful.
00:12:09 And I'm really, I'm really ecstatic.
00:12:12 I'm so happy for RFCK, like in all the ways.
00:12:14 I'm so excited for the future, Ben.
00:12:16 I'm so like, we're together.
00:12:19 We're together.
00:12:20 We're together.
00:12:21 I can't believe it.
00:12:21 It's fucking gay too.
00:12:23 We've overcome like, like, listen, you know,
00:12:26 the Revolutionary War, that's like pussy shit.
00:12:28 I could do that in my fucking sleep.
00:12:30 We PSP HQ, fucking throw it in the trash.
00:12:33 It doesn't even matter.
00:12:34 Who do we need other than me and you?
00:12:37 Who am I gonna talk to Digi about?
00:12:39 I don't even think it's like, it works with you.
00:12:41 It sounds like a disaster.
00:12:43 Not that I wouldn't have liked him to be here,
00:12:45 but you know, other plans, you know, whatever,
00:12:47 it doesn't matter.
00:12:47 The point is, is that like RFCK is the only thing
00:12:50 that I can think of where like being in person
00:12:52 would like, like benefit in like a real way.
00:12:55 Cause you know what?
00:12:56 RFCK has always just been about like,
00:12:58 not being like, you know, overly,
00:13:00 what's the word, produced, you know, not about quality.
00:13:03 It's not about being.
00:13:04 In fact, it's about the opposite.
00:13:05 It's not about being fucking, you know,
00:13:07 all prim and proper,
00:13:09 and about being like a real funny less way.
00:13:10 Like, oh, ha ha, did you see that funny?
00:13:12 Did you see, wow, these cookies?
00:13:14 Well, what's the deal then?
00:13:15 Why, why, why do you, when you click a cookie,
00:13:17 do you get more cookies?
00:13:18 Ha ha, that's so strange.
00:13:19 It's about being real shit.
00:13:22 The interpretation you should have
00:13:24 is that you're literally right here next to me
00:13:26 and Ben right now.
00:13:27 And it's been a long day.
00:13:28 We've been fucking talking all day.
00:13:30 And now we're just sitting down
00:13:30 to play some video games late at night.
00:13:32 You know, the ideal circumstances of you listening
00:13:34 to any of these episodes is late at night,
00:13:36 you know, you want to go to bed, but like, ah,
00:13:38 but I like, I drank like a fucking bang or something
00:13:40 and I can't go to sleep.
00:13:41 Shit, I just drank a marshmallow ex-durance.
00:13:44 Oh, God, I just had, I just had a spike energy,
00:13:46 which is actually just a supplement.
00:13:47 And I'm going to puke up my 15,000 times
00:13:50 by a daily dose of vitamin B. Oh God.
00:13:53 I am, I just can't get over my disappointment
00:13:56 with marshmallow rockstar.
00:13:58 It's just not, it's just not quite there.
00:14:00 It's exactly what I feared.
00:14:02 Frankly, I think you're like, the look on your face
00:14:06 and like the sheer shock when you were at the Korean store
00:14:09 was like, there was no way I could have lived up to it.
00:14:11 No, no, it's just, there's no way.
00:14:13 The promise of the can, the promise of,
00:14:15 the promise of a can that's pure white.
00:14:17 It's like, this is like, like you thought you knew
00:14:21 rockstar ex-durance before.
00:14:22 This is a pure white can,
00:14:26 promises like the apotheosis of everything
00:14:29 that the product here too far was meant to be.
00:14:31 That's what it screams to me.
00:14:33 And I believed it, like the fool that I am.
00:14:35 You know what this is?
00:14:37 Levy Jevy, going back to Bronicon,
00:14:39 every time we go into a convenience store,
00:14:40 he would look for like a stay dead bang.
00:14:42 He would look for like a very like, you know,
00:14:44 ghostly energy drink.
00:14:45 I think this is it.
00:14:46 I think the marshmallow ex-durance.
00:14:48 Absolutely, it is white, black and red.
00:14:50 What's more stated than that?
00:14:51 It absolutely is.
00:14:53 Yeah.
00:14:54 I don't think it existed like a week and a half ago.
00:14:59 Wait, how long has it been since Bronicon?
00:15:01 Oh God, what, like a week or two?
00:15:05 God.
00:15:06 Wait, has this been over a week already?
00:15:07 Yeah, man.
00:15:08 Oh Jesus.
00:15:09 It's a 13.
00:15:11 Is it Friday the 13th?
00:15:13 Feels like it.
00:15:14 No, it's perpetually Friday the 13th, you're with us.
00:15:18 Oh, okay, okay.
00:15:20 My entire life, this is like,
00:15:21 it's gonna be like the most like first world complaint
00:15:24 like ever, like ever since I've been like,
00:15:27 I just like this summer,
00:15:29 I knew it could be like my last chance
00:15:31 to do a lot of stuff with like my friends,
00:15:33 my offline friends at home,
00:15:35 and like a lot of chance to do a lot of things.
00:15:36 You know, I'm gonna be in fucking college
00:15:37 and we put on my nose the grindstone doing that shit.
00:15:39 And like basically my last chance to do a lot of like,
00:15:42 even just online stuff.
00:15:43 Like, it's not like I'm quitting the PCP
00:15:46 or anything related to that,
00:15:47 but like, you know, just the mechanics of
00:15:48 where I'm gonna find like a place
00:15:50 where I can record and be loud,
00:15:52 not my dorm probably.
00:15:53 So I'm gonna be decreasing my internet presence.
00:15:56 So this summer is gonna be like my last message
00:15:58 of a lot of the things I have become accustomed to
00:16:00 for like literal years previous.
00:16:02 Like, you know, the ease of being able to like,
00:16:05 call out my friends whenever I want to be like,
00:16:07 hey, you wanna hang out?
00:16:08 Like I would do so much for granted
00:16:09 that like I didn't do it,
00:16:10 even though I liked my friends,
00:16:11 it was just so much of like a,
00:16:12 ah, I can do that whatever.
00:16:14 And you know what?
00:16:15 I regret it because this summer was so nice
00:16:17 because I was enforcing myself,
00:16:18 like do all the things that I was taking
00:16:20 for granted and not like doing.
00:16:21 And so I had so much jam-packed,
00:16:23 like action-packed fun,
00:16:24 that like my brain is like fucked right now.
00:16:27 Like it feels like, it's funny, right?
00:16:30 Because we're doing, or well,
00:16:33 things are happening in the city outside of our control.
00:16:37 And it's very strange that things seem to be progressing
00:16:41 in almost like alternative reality experience.
00:16:45 You know what I'm talking about, Ben?
00:16:47 You know, that smile that's just wrinkled
00:16:49 on your dimples and your strength.
00:16:51 You'll be a lost being.
00:16:53 I'm afraid I don't follow.
00:16:54 But anyway, and that's been like kind of going to a crawl
00:16:57 and so people will be like, oh, what,
00:16:59 what have you been doing?
00:17:00 Fucking sucking in your own dick.
00:17:02 And yet it's great you ever tried it.
00:17:06 But yeah, I've just been-
00:17:08 I don't kiss and tell.
00:17:09 I've been going all over the place with like,
00:17:11 I've just been fucking going from Milan to Minsk,
00:17:14 if you know what I'm trying to say.
00:17:15 So totally, dude.
00:17:17 We've all been there.
00:17:20 And it's been like, it's been great.
00:17:24 This is really the only way to like,
00:17:26 into something like this, like an error of your life.
00:17:28 Because for like, I don't know why I'm
00:17:31 feeling like a mile a minute right now.
00:17:32 I haven't like, been able to say anything.
00:17:34 This is fun.
00:17:35 I have nothing to say.
00:17:37 Okay, I'm just going to bounce off you
00:17:40 whenever I feel the need to.
00:17:41 You'll have to excuse my enthusiasm,
00:17:44 because I'm just fucking ripping and run right now.
00:17:46 And I'm like, I feel like not screaming,
00:17:49 because then Ben's roommates will want me to die.
00:17:52 They already do.
00:17:53 Wait, wait, Ben, why do you have an image of cough
00:17:56 on your desktop right now?
00:17:58 Oh, well, he asked me to, he said he wanted a,
00:18:02 what do you call it?
00:18:04 Like, he said he liked my color filter on the stream.
00:18:08 And then he was like, I want to make one like that
00:18:11 of my face, of this picture.
00:18:12 And then I was like, I'll fucking do it for him.
00:18:16 Retire.
00:18:17 But then I did.
00:18:17 And like, by the time I had done it,
00:18:19 I think it was Connor had already made him one.
00:18:22 But I think he liked mine better.
00:18:23 Mine had a brighter pink, so get fucked Connor.
00:18:26 We should be on that guy.
00:18:27 We should kill that guy.
00:18:29 What was I saying?
00:18:30 Oh, my entire life proceeding this summer,
00:18:34 and I guess sort of to a lesser extent last summer,
00:18:36 but like for the past like couple of years,
00:18:39 I'm sure I've talked about this before,
00:18:41 but like after middle school,
00:18:43 some like personal shit that I don't really want
00:18:45 to discuss because I'm important to the story went down.
00:18:47 And I started going to online school
00:18:49 for like my high school life.
00:18:50 And it was fun.
00:18:51 It was good because I was able to like pursue
00:18:53 a lot of online stuff and I was able to become
00:18:55 the man that you see before me today.
00:18:57 And I don't regret a moment because you know,
00:18:59 when you regret life choices and you're like,
00:19:00 oh, I should have done this.
00:19:01 Ah, well, you, you would have been a different person.
00:19:03 Well, it doesn't matter.
00:19:04 Point is, is I lit a very stationary life.
00:19:07 And in a moment, I thought it was fun and cool.
00:19:09 Because you know, I was hanging out,
00:19:11 I was rubbing shoulders with a Digi Bro
00:19:13 and it was really nice to be cool.
00:19:15 Can you imagine?
00:19:16 And I was doing this very show
00:19:17 where I was working on this one.
00:19:18 I was doing all these sort of things.
00:19:19 And it was a gale at the time.
00:19:22 But, oh, is that a frenzy?
00:19:25 Oh.
00:19:30 Oh my God, my brain, like why even have anything
00:19:33 that's not this game?
00:19:34 My dopamine is just rushing through my body right now.
00:19:37 Couldn't tell you, dude.
00:19:38 I'm like pissing out dopamine.
00:19:39 I have too much of it.
00:19:40 Like it's, I'm just letting it go to waste.
00:19:42 The thing about, the thing about cookie clicker
00:19:43 is that like 100% of your cookie production
00:19:46 comes from frenzies.
00:19:47 Yeah.
00:19:48 Like everything else is stupid and doesn't matter.
00:19:51 Have you ever done, you know, cookie clicker strats?
00:19:54 Do you know any?
00:19:55 Yeah, I know that the, I'm deliberately not doing them.
00:19:58 But I know that the actual strats are download an app
00:20:00 that tells you what the most efficient next purchase is
00:20:03 and then download another app
00:20:04 that automatically makes it for you.
00:20:09 The most efficient way to play cookie clicker
00:20:10 is not to play it.
00:20:11 But, oh yeah, but I just been living such a stationary life
00:20:14 and such like a fucking like, oh, I'm in my room exclusively.
00:20:18 And that's been one of the things I want to accomplish
00:20:21 with like going away, you know, going to a new city
00:20:23 and having to deal with all the ramifications
00:20:25 of going to college and doing that.
00:20:26 It's just cause I want to like, I don't know,
00:20:29 to fucking live because I have never done it before.
00:20:32 Basically, you know, I,
00:20:34 Ah, pathetic.
00:20:36 You, you've been, we're such a huge inspiration.
00:20:39 I mean, not just in this way, but in a lot of ways,
00:20:41 but it's specifically like,
00:20:43 you going on your fucking like adventures across Europe.
00:20:47 I mean, that's crazy.
00:20:48 That's crazy stuff I could have never imagined
00:20:51 before like this summer where like, I, you know,
00:20:53 I've been to more places and I've been way more independent
00:20:56 than I have, you know, in past my life.
00:20:59 It's felt so exhilarating and great.
00:21:01 And I'm now at the end of this long line of fucking God,
00:21:06 okay, all right, listen, all right, listen to this, Ben.
00:21:08 This is crazy.
00:21:09 This is crazy.
00:21:11 In 30 days, I went from San Diego to London, to San Diego,
00:21:20 to LA, to Monterey, to San Francisco, California,
00:21:23 back again to San Diego, to Baltimore, Maryland,
00:21:28 to BronyCon, to Michigan, to Boston.
00:21:31 Oh, and New York City is also in there.
00:21:33 New York, we spent like three hours in New York City.
00:21:35 That's right.
00:21:36 And we got McDonald's in Times Square.
00:21:38 And stuff like that.
00:21:39 And we smelled the track.
00:21:40 We smelled the scent of the gutter.
00:21:41 I'm so privileged that I was able to like,
00:21:43 even like afford to save up that much money
00:21:45 to do something like that.
00:21:46 And like, I was able to like, you know, be able to,
00:21:50 it's a privilege lifestyle, obviously.
00:21:52 And I'm super thankful for it.
00:21:53 And it's just such a, it's indescribable,
00:21:58 this feeling of just sheer like,
00:22:02 a crescendo of so many things that have been building up.
00:22:04 So many like ideas that have been fostering on my mind.
00:22:07 The ending of so many like things
00:22:09 that I've wanted to do online.
00:22:10 Like like this, this slime score of stuff
00:22:13 that's been going on lately.
00:22:14 You know, a lot of people are finding, you know,
00:22:16 don't really care about it.
00:22:17 And a lot of it hasn't really had the impact
00:22:19 of stuff that's happened previously in this work.
00:22:20 That's fine.
00:22:21 Cause it's something that I've wanted to do for a while.
00:22:23 It's something that I've been really like excited to do.
00:22:26 And the idea of it, it's not like over or going to be over
00:22:29 by the time I start school.
00:22:30 But like, that's like the last vestige of my old life,
00:22:33 of my old like thing that I'm gonna be doing.
00:22:35 Obviously I'm gonna keep doing it this morning.
00:22:36 And keep coming back over here and do R2K with them.
00:22:38 But like, I've done all these adventures,
00:22:41 I've done all these travels.
00:22:42 I've said goodbye to all my friends
00:22:44 that I've known all my life.
00:22:46 So goodbye to the town and the city
00:22:47 that I've known all my life.
00:22:49 I've said goodbye to all of it.
00:22:50 And I'm finishing up all the work that I've wanted to do.
00:22:53 You know, obviously there's still projects
00:22:55 I could have done, but like all the ones that, you know,
00:22:56 I actually wanted to, you know,
00:22:58 slime corporate is actually started working on this for,
00:23:01 doing all these new things I have done before.
00:23:03 I mean, just early today, even though like I'm really bad at it,
00:23:05 it's really embarrassing and sucks.
00:23:07 I've been working out with you,
00:23:08 which I've never done before in my entire life.
00:23:10 Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
00:23:11 Sick and cool.
00:23:12 Should we talk about getting swole?
00:23:14 Dude, we can't.
00:23:14 Should we talk about Baramunchi?
00:23:16 We can't talk about Baramunchi,
00:23:17 but just to finish this off,
00:23:18 like now I'm away from all those trips
00:23:21 and I don't want to go on anymore.
00:23:22 I don't want to get another plane forever.
00:23:24 And I'm here in a new city.
00:23:26 I've all, like it doesn't, part of me is like,
00:23:29 it doesn't feel like anything changed.
00:23:30 You know, I've been to Boston so many times before.
00:23:32 I've been for so many extended periods.
00:23:34 I've been in this chair before,
00:23:36 doing Arpsichia live with you before,
00:23:37 but now it's just the beginning of so much more.
00:23:40 And it's so weird to say,
00:23:41 because none of the ramifications of this
00:23:44 will be felt by like the people watching this, right?
00:23:47 Like there's been so many, like in the PCP,
00:23:50 there's been so many like, oh, okay, new shifts.
00:23:52 Like, you know, Hippo has been doing his new,
00:23:54 or not new necessarily, but like been doing all the way,
00:23:57 but it feels like a new era of Hippo goodness.
00:23:59 It feels like a new like rejuvenating of things.
00:24:02 Nate's been starting his, you know,
00:24:04 he went full-time YouTube.
00:24:05 He's doing that for a while.
00:24:06 There's gonna be new things happening in the PCP right now.
00:24:09 And as for me as well, but like,
00:24:11 none of it is gonna be like,
00:24:12 oh, new things that you can produce.
00:24:14 In fact, it's gonna be like the exact opposite
00:24:15 where I'm like, no longer here, you know?
00:24:18 Hell yeah, dude.
00:24:19 Hell yeah, that's what everyone wants.
00:24:22 But yeah, you're gonna pull a Jesse, just disappear.
00:24:25 Uh, that will be kind of,
00:24:27 I don't know what to expect honestly.
00:24:29 I don't know what things will be like with my schedule,
00:24:31 because it's not like I will want to do it any less,
00:24:33 but like it will just be like,
00:24:35 like I can't do it almost.
00:24:37 Like, I'll be able to record with you
00:24:40 because I'm here in your house right now, right?
00:24:43 Like I can come over on certain days
00:24:45 and we can record together and we'll be fine and good.
00:24:47 But like, I'm not gonna like, like, hey, Ben,
00:24:50 I wanna be in the next PCP.
00:24:51 Can I come over with you and we record together?
00:24:54 That would be, the answer would be no.
00:24:56 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:57 Get the fuck out.
00:24:58 Oh, dude, you're watching Defuntland up there?
00:25:00 Yeah.
00:25:01 Defuntland's so good, but pull up,
00:25:03 which one are you listening?
00:25:04 This was,
00:25:08 I just kind of have the playlist going.
00:25:10 This is Disney's best coaster,
00:25:11 Space Mountain from the Earth to the Moon.
00:25:13 When did you get into Defuntland?
00:25:15 Oh, I mean, I knew about them before.
00:25:19 I mean, I've seen them before,
00:25:22 like as of probably like two years ago
00:25:24 or a year and a half ago.
00:25:25 And I don't know, I just,
00:25:29 you, that feel when you just,
00:25:32 that feel when you just need something to listen to
00:25:34 and you just listen to the entire fucking playlist
00:25:37 and then it's done and you're like,
00:25:38 well, still need something and you just start it again.
00:25:42 Defuntland, like riled up in something to me
00:25:46 that I had never like felt before.
00:25:48 And I got into Defuntland like when they like
00:25:50 first kind of blew up.
00:25:51 Like, I forget what video it was,
00:25:54 but there was one video that like went viral
00:25:56 and then like it was like one of the very first ones
00:25:58 and I got into it there.
00:25:59 And it was cool.
00:26:01 I feel like they've got like pretty overproduced now it is.
00:26:04 Like they're pretty like,
00:26:06 there's like a bunch of editors
00:26:07 and like there's like two writers now I think
00:26:09 and it's like a lot of like extra blow
00:26:12 and I don't think he adds anything.
00:26:13 And he's sort of just become like Wikipedia guy
00:26:16 where at the beginning I feel like he was like,
00:26:17 almost like personally enraged by a lot of them
00:26:20 as opposed to like,
00:26:21 What do you mean by enraged?
00:26:23 Tell me about that.
00:26:24 Because one of the things that I don't,
00:26:26 the thing that I don't like about it
00:26:27 is the sort of inherent way
00:26:29 that it like fetishizes commercial endeavors.
00:26:33 And sometimes I don't feel like that.
00:26:34 Sometimes it feels like he's mocking a thing
00:26:36 and I like that.
00:26:37 But sometimes he'll get like a little sentimental
00:26:40 about something being closed
00:26:41 and it makes me feel pure disgust.
00:26:44 That's the, that's where I want.
00:26:46 That's the reason why I want,
00:26:48 why just because like it's Disney
00:26:49 and you don't think that anyone should be,
00:26:51 you know, attached to what they create.
00:26:52 Yeah, absolutely not.
00:26:54 It's horrible.
00:26:55 Like, like these things are just inherently evil.
00:26:58 No, they're inherently evil.
00:27:00 They are. That's insane.
00:27:01 These things are like, these things are wild beasts.
00:27:03 These things are behemoths that will turn on you
00:27:05 and kill you in a moment
00:27:06 if it will profit them even a bit.
00:27:08 Hi.
00:27:09 Hey, let's go ahead.
00:27:10 Don't, I'm not here.
00:27:12 I was just...
00:27:13 No, come on.
00:27:14 You guys, you guys, come on in.
00:27:16 The one condition of you being in here
00:27:18 is no parallel conversations.
00:27:20 Yeah, that's what I was trying to avoid last time.
00:27:21 Okay.
00:27:22 But that's not, that's not to say that,
00:27:24 it's not that you can't talk.
00:27:25 Okay.
00:27:26 Okay, yeah.
00:27:27 No, my bag's downstairs.
00:27:29 Okay.
00:27:30 What's going on?
00:27:31 Hey.
00:27:31 We're playing cookie clicker.
00:27:32 We were talking about defunct land.
00:27:33 This guy doesn't think that there's any artistry
00:27:35 in like a theme park.
00:27:36 I didn't say it.
00:27:37 That's not what I said.
00:27:38 Yeah, you're right.
00:27:39 That's not what I said.
00:27:39 That's not what you said at all actually.
00:27:40 I didn't say there's no artistry.
00:27:41 I said that it's evil.
00:27:42 Well...
00:27:44 Oh, you want more?
00:27:46 Do you actually want more?
00:27:47 Yeah, I like it.
00:27:47 Wait, I want to see what color the liquid is.
00:27:49 Is this just clear?
00:27:50 It's clear.
00:27:53 It seems like a bunch on manufacturing, I would imagine.
00:27:55 Did you like it?
00:27:56 What do you think of it?
00:27:57 Yeah, I like it a lot.
00:27:57 I like it?
00:28:00 It's just that the cotton candy
00:28:01 is like the same thing, but better.
00:28:03 I don't know.
00:28:04 Does it kind of taste like
00:28:05 if you mix melon soda with grenadine?
00:28:08 I don't taste melon.
00:28:09 It kind of just tastes like cream soda.
00:28:10 No.
00:28:11 I taste it a lot.
00:28:11 Now that you say that.
00:28:13 Wait, give me a second.
00:28:14 No, it's cream soda.
00:28:15 It's just cream soda is what it is.
00:28:17 No, it's not just cream soda.
00:28:19 There's more new ones to it than that.
00:28:21 It's got a whole flavor profile
00:28:22 that you're just ignoring.
00:28:24 It tastes like something I've had before my childhood.
00:28:26 It's cream soda.
00:28:28 I just realized it's cream soda.
00:28:30 Close that door, but we can continue.
00:28:31 Oh, yeah.
00:28:32 Oh, wait, what time is it?
00:28:33 I gotta keep an eye on the time.
00:28:35 Well, I set my alarm to go off before the bus gets here
00:28:37 and before I have to leave,
00:28:38 so I can hear what time it is.
00:28:39 I have no idea what time it is.
00:28:40 Oh, it's almost 10.
00:28:42 Okay, I have to leave in a couple of minutes.
00:28:45 It's because the bus comes at 10 o'clock and I
00:28:47 have to get out of here at 10 o'clock.
00:28:48 Ben, I don't even disagree with you.
00:28:50 I need your reaction, which didn't need to happen.
00:28:52 Then I thought you were saying that you weren't.
00:28:54 Why don't you be like Neil deGrasse Tyson
00:28:58 and be purely logical?
00:29:00 It's a giant corporation.
00:29:01 It wants your money.
00:29:02 It's evil, but it's also, art's also artistic.
00:29:06 There's multiplicity in art.
00:29:08 I mean, a lot of, okay, I will stand by this
00:29:12 till the day I die.
00:29:13 And a lot of renaissance, at least.
00:29:15 I don't really know a lot about early Disney
00:29:17 and I'm sure there were a lot of varying stuff.
00:29:19 I don't really know all about Walt personally, honestly.
00:29:22 But I know for a fact that in renaissance Disney movies,
00:29:26 there was genuine passion from a lot of people
00:29:29 who genuinely wanted to create a good artistic product.
00:29:32 And I think they did it a lot of the time.
00:29:34 There was definitely, like it was not just
00:29:38 a soulless crank out for money.
00:29:40 Obviously it was obviously Eisner wanted money, obviously.
00:29:43 This is not to my point.
00:29:46 No, I know it's not.
00:29:47 I'm just saying.
00:29:48 I become a profitable thing in a legit career move
00:29:51 that people's parents and family didn't ostracize them for.
00:29:54 To be an animator for many, many years
00:29:56 was just like, what the fuck are you doing?
00:29:58 Like that was like the mom on the YouTube
00:30:01 were now of like, you know, what early...
00:30:03 Did Snow White make a lot of money?
00:30:05 Oh, dude, fuck yeah, yeah, I did.
00:30:07 They went on the massive debt first, though, didn't they?
00:30:09 Well, yeah, they did it for Cinderella.
00:30:12 Or was it Sleeping BlueDee?
00:30:13 I think it might've been Sleepin' BlueDee.
00:30:15 Sleepin' BlueDee.
00:30:16 Oh wait, Google search reconorder right now.
00:30:18 No.
00:30:19 Google search recon...
00:30:20 I'll look up reconorder.
00:30:22 You leaving?
00:30:23 She's getting her problem.
00:30:24 All right.
00:30:25 The problem is not.
00:30:27 My problem is not that the artistry of these things is bad.
00:30:32 My problem is not that they are not artistically crafted.
00:30:36 My problem is that whatever else they might be,
00:30:39 they are commodified.
00:30:41 Yeah, okay, you're not wrong.
00:30:42 And I have no problem with that.
00:30:44 And I just really hate it when a little bit of...
00:30:46 I hate it when sentimentality creeps into the way that like...
00:30:52 Defunctland isn't really that guilty of it,
00:30:54 but like Company Man is way more guilty of it.
00:30:57 When sentimentality creeps into it,
00:30:58 when they're talking about a commercial venture,
00:31:00 as though we should pity or hope for the best
00:31:06 for these entities that absolutely would not do the same for us,
00:31:10 these things would fucking slit our throats for a nickel.
00:31:12 Well, okay, hold on.
00:31:13 I cave that the door is open.
00:31:15 You're right.
00:31:18 The reason I think there's a difference there
00:31:20 is not just the host of the show being different.
00:31:23 Company Man is very like...
00:31:25 Company Man is a very weird person.
00:31:27 He's a very weird host.
00:31:28 I think that...
00:31:30 I mean, I don't know about the guy personally.
00:31:32 I think that it's somewhat inevitable
00:31:33 because I feel like when you're talking...
00:31:34 You have to make an emotional arc.
00:31:37 Yeah, it has to have an emotional arc.
00:31:39 You have to make a story out of it.
00:31:42 And the protagonist of the story has to be someone
00:31:45 that you feel something for.
00:31:46 So you have to anthropomorphize these behemoths.
00:31:51 What I was going to say is exactly what I was saying earlier,
00:31:53 just about...
00:31:54 Company Man talks about a fucking target,
00:31:57 which is nothing but business.
00:32:00 It's not as though that's a controversial stance,
00:32:03 like it just is a business.
00:32:04 It's what it is about.
00:32:05 Cassie Snap is leaving the building.
00:32:07 Bye.
00:32:08 Sorry to interrupt your conversation.
00:32:09 That's fine.
00:32:10 If Company Man, if Defunct Land made a video
00:32:14 that was about Disney, the ups and downs of that or something,
00:32:19 about the ups and downs of Disney,
00:32:21 that would be stupid too.
00:32:23 But it's not about Disney as a company.
00:32:27 It's about these specific rides,
00:32:29 which, while the infrastructure of the music part
00:32:32 is solely a business,
00:32:34 it's like these rides, again, have artistry in them.
00:32:37 I'm not saying that you're not saying that.
00:32:38 I'm just saying that he gets attached to not like...
00:32:41 It's weird to get attached to Target
00:32:43 because what is the experience of Target?
00:32:45 Like you pay money for items that you get and then you leave.
00:32:50 But the experience of riding, especially at Disney theme park,
00:32:54 there's a lot of levels there and a lot of artistry
00:32:56 and a lot of things to appreciate in it.
00:32:57 So it's not just like,
00:32:59 I'm sad that I can't give Disney money more.
00:33:01 It's like, I'm sad that this piece of genuine history
00:33:03 is not being preserved in any way.
00:33:06 The experience of a roller coaster, or any museum park ride,
00:33:11 is the exact same thing as like a stage musical,
00:33:14 where it's so finite and limited of a thing,
00:33:16 even more so than a stage musical because there can be the reruns.
00:33:19 But the original production of a musical,
00:33:22 in the same way as a music park,
00:33:23 just happens and then leaves and gone
00:33:26 and there's no way that even can experience it
00:33:27 in the way it's meant to be.
00:33:28 You can record it, but it's not the same thing.
00:33:30 It's not the experience of being in there in the theater theater.
00:33:32 There is something particularly tawdry to me
00:33:38 about a roller coaster as a commercial object.
00:33:44 In the way that it is like literally just a mill
00:33:47 where people line up to be loaded into it,
00:33:49 run through it, and then ejected,
00:33:52 there is something like particularly...
00:33:56 Okay, well...
00:33:57 And I get that like, yeah, you're paying for this.
00:33:59 It's about the experience.
00:34:00 Like, it's not the...
00:34:02 It's not that I don't even understand the appeal.
00:34:04 I do.
00:34:04 There's just something...
00:34:06 Like, if I...
00:34:07 Okay, I kind of want to qualify this.
00:34:09 Like, I could probably go to a theme park,
00:34:12 pay some money, and have a good time.
00:34:14 I'm not saying that I'm incapable of that.
00:34:15 I'm just saying when I see it, right?
00:34:17 When I see it in a video of like people like,
00:34:20 oh, look, a load of like 30 people
00:34:21 is being loaded into this thing and chatteled around
00:34:25 and then spat out.
00:34:25 And then like the worker is just like sad
00:34:27 and just like doesn't care.
00:34:28 Then they're talking about like,
00:34:29 oh, yeah, like fucking, you know, four million.
00:34:32 Change this to Benson.
00:34:34 I miss the...
00:34:35 I miss the cookie.
00:34:36 I'm so fucking...
00:34:37 I miss the cookie.
00:34:37 Change this to RFCK.
00:34:40 Okay.
00:34:43 Did you forget like what?
00:34:45 I'm trying to think of something good.
00:34:47 Bennett goes to look at his keyboard,
00:34:49 looks at his keyboard for like a solid second.
00:34:51 Like his hands hovering over the keyboard,
00:34:53 like unable to spell RFCK.
00:34:58 Polly slime.
00:35:00 Wow, that's...
00:35:02 Didn't even capitalize the C, dude.
00:35:04 Yeah, that's right.
00:35:05 We're off-brand.
00:35:06 That was the worst experience of my life
00:35:09 was watching that happen.
00:35:10 Cool.
00:35:11 Well, you get ready for plenty more.
00:35:14 Plenty more of that came from.
00:35:15 Okay.
00:35:16 I don't even like have anything to say
00:35:18 to what you're saying,
00:35:19 because I get it.
00:35:20 Like I don't viscerally get it,
00:35:21 but like there's nothing I can say to it.
00:35:23 Keep it down a little bit.
00:35:24 Sure, sure, sure.
00:35:24 There's nothing I can like say to like comment
00:35:26 in order to I really want to,
00:35:27 because it doesn't really matter.
00:35:28 But I will say that like,
00:35:30 I feel that more worth like,
00:35:33 the artistry and display is almost never,
00:35:35 like in a Disney amusement park ride.
00:35:38 You know, you're talking about artistry.
00:35:39 I don't know.
00:35:40 I know that like, okay,
00:35:44 technical skill goes,
00:35:45 I have a hard time seeing a roller coaster
00:35:47 as a work of art.
00:35:48 I really do.
00:35:49 Ben, okay.
00:35:50 I'm actually gonna say exactly that,
00:35:52 that it's almost never a roller coaster.
00:35:55 Imagineers, the people who make Disney rides,
00:35:58 ha ha, funny name.
00:36:00 We'll always say that making amusement,
00:36:02 making roller coasters is always the hardest thing,
00:36:04 because the experience on a roller coaster
00:36:06 is exclusively like you go fast,
00:36:08 and it's fun because you go fast.
00:36:10 And there's very,
00:36:11 like if you look at side by side,
00:36:12 it's something like Thunder Mountain,
00:36:14 as opposed to like another ride,
00:36:15 like the Haunted Mansion,
00:36:16 way less theme and way,
00:36:18 not less effort,
00:36:19 but like way less of like an overarching artistry.
00:36:22 In the Haunted Mansion,
00:36:24 it's not a go fast thing.
00:36:26 And this is where like the sort of stuff
00:36:27 where like Disney artistry really comes into play,
00:36:30 because it's not just like they've spruced up the queue,
00:36:34 and then like the roller coasters painted a different color.
00:36:37 That's not all I'm talking about.
00:36:38 I'm talking about how the meticulously,
00:36:41 how they went to every step of that ride.
00:36:42 That's such like a weird,
00:36:43 like I don't describe it like multi-media ride.
00:36:46 It starts with a walking session,
00:36:49 and then there's like an elevator sequence.
00:36:50 Which ride are you talking about?
00:36:51 The Haunted Mansion.
00:36:52 Have you been on it?
00:36:53 Oh, I've been on the Tower of Terror.
00:36:56 Not completely different.
00:36:59 I'm not sure if I've been on the Haunted Mansion.
00:37:01 I've been to Disney World a couple of times.
00:37:03 So I feel like probably, but I don't remember.
00:37:06 But like, it's not like a fast like thrill ride.
00:37:10 Almost none of like the truly incredible artistic rides
00:37:13 are usually thrill rides.
00:37:15 Those are very hard to make.
00:37:16 But the Haunted Mansion,
00:37:18 just this like meticulously designed and crafted house,
00:37:23 just even the exterior of the ride being like,
00:37:26 like that you have to perfectly recreate.
00:37:28 I'm not talking about Disneyland right now
00:37:29 because I'd never been to Disney World.
00:37:30 But like, and also it was first,
00:37:33 the lawn that they have to maintain
00:37:35 and like the outside, they have to perfectly met.
00:37:37 First of all, make it fit in with the surrounding areas
00:37:40 of New Orleans Square.
00:37:41 The section of the park it takes place in.
00:37:43 And then they have to make it look dilapidated inside.
00:37:46 And they have to do all of these things
00:37:48 in the queue, in the ride themselves.
00:37:50 I mean, if you were to just like,
00:37:50 Google search Haunted Mansion right now
00:37:52 because you'll see that it is like, okay, fine.
00:37:54 But it is like a very like,
00:37:57 I mean, I would describe it in another way,
00:37:58 like just meticulously crafted artistic experience
00:38:02 that you would have to be,
00:38:03 at least somewhat passionate making.
00:38:05 And I know that because there's interviews with the guy
00:38:07 who may not ever get his fucking name because he's famous.
00:38:09 I don't disagree with any of this.
00:38:11 I know that it's all about crafting an experience
00:38:14 or whatever.
00:38:15 And it's not, it's not just like,
00:38:16 how do we make this the funnest thing?
00:38:17 Like there's like lore.
00:38:18 There's like heaps of fucking lore for a ton of rides.
00:38:22 There's like genuine like, like intrigue
00:38:24 with like the creation of rides.
00:38:26 And there are some fucking rides that didn't get it.
00:38:27 What do you mean?
00:38:28 What do you mean by lore?
00:38:29 What do you mean by there's lore?
00:38:30 Okay, okay.
00:38:31 Well, I mean, I know that certain rides
00:38:32 have like a sort of narrative to them that like,
00:38:34 you know, you're waiting in line and you see stuff.
00:38:37 And then you get, yeah, I get that.
00:38:40 I'm talking about like genuine fucking like,
00:38:42 you have to like environmental gameplay
00:38:44 if you pick up to understand some things.
00:38:46 I'm gonna talk about one that wasn't actually made,
00:38:49 but like was like the magnum opus of this idea.
00:38:53 And it sort of spread to the part
00:38:54 of the most emblematic thing.
00:38:56 The idea of, are you trying to...
00:38:59 Gay, yes.
00:39:00 I'm trying to think about how to explain this.
00:39:01 In Dingland, in Frontierland,
00:39:04 there is a section where you can ride
00:39:07 a big Thunder Mountain, which is a roller coaster.
00:39:09 Is that the one?
00:39:09 Does that end with like a water flume?
00:39:11 It does in like, do you mean in Paris, I think?
00:39:14 Okay, then I'm not sure if I've ridden it.
00:39:16 I haven't been to Disney World in probably like 15 years.
00:39:20 I've never been to a world.
00:39:21 I want you for the bad way.
00:39:23 Oh, I've never.
00:39:24 Right, you're a fucking West Coast slime ball.
00:39:27 So I'm talking about Disneyland.
00:39:28 Yeah, I've never been to Disneyland.
00:39:29 I've only been to Disney World.
00:39:31 So okay, yeah, there's definitely gonna be rides
00:39:33 you've been on that I have never been on.
00:39:35 Oh, they would have the Haunted Mansion,
00:39:37 but anyway, it doesn't matter.
00:39:38 Probably.
00:39:39 What was I fucking saying?
00:39:40 Oh yeah, okay, Big Thunder Mountain.
00:39:42 There was gonna be a plan, because historically,
00:39:45 there's always been one big spot of Disneyland
00:39:47 that has not been used.
00:39:49 And it's always been a question like,
00:39:51 where are they gonna put that?
00:39:52 What kind of rides, what kind of land are they gonna put there?
00:39:55 And so there's, I think it's Tony Baxter.
00:39:59 No, that's an animator.
00:40:00 I'm retarded.
00:40:01 Tell me about James Baxter.
00:40:02 Oh yeah.
00:40:03 God, what's this fucking,
00:40:04 I can't remember, it doesn't matter.
00:40:05 A famous Imagineer was going to make an entire section
00:40:10 around Big Thunder Mountain called Big Thunder Mesa.
00:40:14 There's gonna be a bunch of rides there
00:40:15 that will all tie in to this one central idea
00:40:19 of this Wild West town that would be made.
00:40:24 And there was gonna be lore about,
00:40:26 there was a really wealthy owner of a mine who died,
00:40:29 and that would tie in to, I think,
00:40:31 the Haunted Mansion in some way,
00:40:32 or maybe it was gonna tie into Big Thunder Mountain about it.
00:40:35 He was a spear that was compelling
00:40:37 via the mine carts to go out of whack,
00:40:39 and that's why they're really fast and stuff.
00:40:41 But there was just this large, elaborate fucking section
00:40:44 of land that was gonna be plotted out to foster
00:40:47 this narrative of this town, this Wild West town,
00:40:51 that was gonna be meticulously made,
00:40:52 and just like the craftsmanship on me
00:40:54 that would have to not only just the technical skill
00:40:57 of achieving the rides that he wanted to,
00:40:58 but also just like the sheer imagination
00:41:00 that he would have to have come up with
00:41:02 in the first place in some of the rides.
00:41:04 There was just gonna be a whole bunch of shit
00:41:06 that was gonna go in there.
00:41:06 There's gonna be fucking, again, more lore.
00:41:09 I can't write it off the top of my head, but.
00:41:10 You're Google.
00:41:12 Hold on.
00:41:13 No, no Google.
00:41:14 Okay, fine.
00:41:15 What are you doing right now?
00:41:16 I'm grabbing my fucking boomer pills.
00:41:21 Boomer pills?
00:41:22 Yeah.
00:41:22 What?
00:41:24 Wait, are these like memory pills?
00:41:26 No, no.
00:41:29 It's just caffeine.
00:41:30 Oh.
00:41:31 There's some right here too.
00:41:33 Sick.
00:41:34 Oh, is there?
00:41:34 I mean like, okay, I'm almost out.
00:41:36 Oh god, wait, it's a frenzy.
00:41:37 Oh my god, I gotta capitalize.
00:41:39 I gotta capitalize on this frenzy, dude.
00:41:40 Oh, do capitalize?
00:41:41 This doesn't sound very insane of you.
00:41:43 Shut the fuck up, I'll fucking kill you.
00:41:45 I mean, I have to seize the means of this frenzy.
00:41:49 But yeah, anyway, stuff like that,
00:41:51 where it's like, this one guy has an idea
00:41:53 for like an entire fucking simulated town
00:41:56 experiencing what he wants to manufacture
00:41:58 in this theme park with all this well-thought-out things
00:42:02 about the people who would live there
00:42:03 and the sort of people who would affect it
00:42:04 over the course of it, it's like a fantasized reality.
00:42:07 Like, okay, strip away rides,
00:42:10 like rides not being experienced,
00:42:12 like not being a thing that exists.
00:42:14 Disneyland is still an artistic marvel,
00:42:17 just the way that it uses sightlines and smells
00:42:20 and sounds and visualizations of like,
00:42:23 just mainstream, just mainstream USA,
00:42:25 about this crafted experience that Disney wanted,
00:42:28 Walt Disney wanted to make from all the things
00:42:30 that he had experienced in his childhood,
00:42:31 all the good vibration that he had seen
00:42:34 living in like rural America.
00:42:36 He wanted to bring that to this theme park
00:42:39 and he like sculpted these fucking buildings
00:42:43 and they look incredible and they look masterful
00:42:45 and he used, people always like, are like, ha ha, oh dude,
00:42:49 Disneyland uses smells, like hack your fucking brain
00:42:51 and brainwash you and they're like thinking
00:42:53 what they want you to think.
00:42:54 And they brainwash you into thinking
00:42:56 you're enjoying yourself, but it's just a trick.
00:43:00 It's like, that sort of thing is genius.
00:43:03 They're like, they're like completely crafting
00:43:06 your actual, this isn't a video game,
00:43:08 this isn't anything like that,
00:43:09 you're really there in real life.
00:43:11 There's a crafted experience, it's incredible.
00:43:14 Yeah, I mean, you're not, you're not wrong,
00:43:17 you're not wrong.
00:43:19 I forget the point I was making.
00:43:21 Yeah, I guess I love theme parks now.
00:43:23 Me and yours point was like completely separate
00:43:25 and it wasn't even related to one another.
00:43:27 Yeah, it wasn't even like a discussion,
00:43:28 it was just you said something and I said it too.
00:43:30 I'm just like, isn't capitalism bad?
00:43:31 And you're just like, yeah, but isn't creativity cool?
00:43:34 Ha ha ha ha ha.
00:43:36 I guess, maybe there's a room in this town
00:43:38 for the two of us.
00:43:41 Ha ha ha, never mind.
00:43:45 I was watching the, you know, I said on the PCP,
00:43:49 you weren't on this week's PCP, right?
00:43:51 You didn't.
00:43:52 No, I was.
00:43:53 You were.
00:43:54 Oh yeah, I was talking about,
00:43:54 I was talking about defunct TV.
00:43:56 And I said on that the defunct.
00:43:57 Oh, I don't remember that.
00:43:58 I brought it up, I brought it up defunct TV
00:44:01 and I said that defunct TV is just a series
00:44:03 about the Muppets.
00:44:04 Turns out I was wrong.
00:44:05 Most of them are about the Muppets,
00:44:06 but some of them are about other TV shows,
00:44:08 most of which involve puppetry of some kind.
00:44:11 I don't know if that's deliberate or just a coincidence,
00:44:14 but, you know, it's like a good,
00:44:19 like informative narrative about like the life
00:44:21 and times of Jim Hansen, right?
00:44:23 Like it's cool.
00:44:24 Jim Hansen's pretty good, I guess, and stuff,
00:44:30 but I just can't get over,
00:44:34 I just can't get over that it's all funded by capital.
00:44:37 It's all in service of capital, it makes me mad.
00:44:40 It makes me fucking mad.
00:44:41 Isn't that all art?
00:44:42 Like all that?
00:44:43 What is it?
00:44:44 Yeah, isn't it?
00:44:45 Like any TV show, any comic book.
00:44:48 All art, you say.
00:44:49 All art is funded by capital.
00:44:51 Not literally all art, but like almost all mainstream.
00:44:55 Commercial art, mainstream art, yeah.
00:44:58 Sure.
00:44:58 It is.
00:44:59 And I hate mainstream art, I hate everything.
00:45:01 Do you feel that way when some talks about like anime shows?
00:45:03 Yes, absolutely do.
00:45:06 I hate it.
00:45:07 I can't fucking stand any of it.
00:45:08 It's all fucking poison.
00:45:10 It's all corrupt, it's all evil.
00:45:12 It's all in service of devils.
00:45:13 Oh poo.
00:45:14 No, not oh poo.
00:45:15 Oh poo.
00:45:16 Oh Ben, why can't you just,
00:45:18 why can't you just lighten up?
00:45:20 Why can't you just lighten up?
00:45:21 Just turn your brain off.
00:45:22 Just learn to enjoy it.
00:45:22 You don't have to turn your brain off.
00:45:23 Yes you do, I literally feel like to ignore the fact
00:45:26 that everything in this world is corrupt and evil.
00:45:28 You have to turn your brain off.
00:45:29 You don't even have to ignore it.
00:45:30 You can think about it while you're talking about it
00:45:32 constantly, but like it doesn't mean that it's,
00:45:35 like the art that itself is any less valuable
00:45:38 or that it's any less.
00:45:39 I kind of think that it means that it's less valuable.
00:45:43 Hot take.
00:45:44 That's my hot take.
00:45:51 It's just, I don't know man.
00:45:54 Just hate everything.
00:45:55 I can't stand it.
00:45:57 I can't stand existing in this world anymore.
00:46:00 Well, everything's bad.
00:46:02 Everything's bad and corrupt.
00:46:03 Listen, it's Cougar Clicker version, the current year.
00:46:07 You know, I mean, this game's pretty good.
00:46:11 Cougar Clicker is the only thing, like simulation,
00:46:15 it's similar to being like a robber bear
00:46:17 and like lords over the people.
00:46:19 I'm like Mav's mind.
00:46:21 Yeah, but I mean, it's all in good fun.
00:46:23 You know what I'm saying?
00:46:25 Everyone's gonna say there's something.
00:46:26 Oh, oh, defunct plan.
00:46:27 Fucking, Cougar Clicker doesn't matter.
00:46:29 Go back to defunct plan.
00:46:30 Go back to it right now.
00:46:31 All right, fine.
00:46:32 Go to the channel.
00:46:33 What about it?
00:46:34 There's a podcast that he has.
00:46:36 I got defunct plan and I got way like fucking coolated
00:46:40 into like the entire theme park YouTube sphere
00:46:43 with Rob Plays and fucking Disney and Dan
00:46:45 and yes to world like everyone.
00:46:46 I get like, oh, people are right over there.
00:46:48 Ha ha, that's funny.
00:46:50 Here's the point.
00:46:51 Here's the point, I'm trying.
00:46:53 It's like, sure.
00:46:55 I know that like to enjoy anything,
00:46:58 you can't think about this stuff, right?
00:47:01 And like by being mad,
00:47:05 by being mad that all commercial art
00:47:07 is created in service of capital,
00:47:09 I am hamstringing my ability to like engage with
00:47:12 and enjoy like most things.
00:47:15 My question is, is enjoyment of those things even valuable?
00:47:19 Is it valuable at all to be like, boy,
00:47:23 I'd sure like to go to Disney World.
00:47:25 Boy, I'd sure like to watch newest seasonal anime.
00:47:29 I kind of think I'm happier
00:47:30 just like dismissing all those things out of hand.
00:47:33 I kind of, I don't want any of it.
00:47:35 I don't want these things that are made to make me happy.
00:47:38 It depends what you mean by that.
00:47:39 I'm fine, I'm fine without them.
00:47:41 Thank you very much.
00:47:41 It depends on what you mean by valuable.
00:47:43 I mean, there are certainly going to be like TV shows
00:47:46 that you would enjoy.
00:47:48 I mean, depends on what you mean, what is it valuable?
00:47:50 Not with my mindset, you know what I'm saying?
00:47:53 There could be, if you were to, yeah.
00:47:56 There could be, that it wouldn't be like,
00:48:00 I'm trying to think about how to phrase it.
00:48:01 Like it just, it wouldn't be a matter of like,
00:48:03 you have to like calculate like,
00:48:05 oh, is my enjoyment of this like equal to the morality?
00:48:08 No, no, wait, I was-
00:48:09 It's not even about morality.
00:48:10 It doesn't mean, it's not even about
00:48:12 the material consequences.
00:48:12 Actually, I don't care, I'll just talk about it.
00:48:14 There's a podcast that you do, Rob Plays,
00:48:16 Kevin who runs to Funkland,
00:48:18 which has my favorite expression
00:48:22 of like a person, like, okay.
00:48:28 You know that experience when you're in a group,
00:48:30 a somewhat secluded, you know,
00:48:32 sort of not ostracized group, but like a very niche group.
00:48:36 And you come up with all these fanciful, funny ways
00:48:39 to in-fight with the people who are very close to you,
00:48:42 but just not cool and niche enough.
00:48:45 Let this in-fight in a little bit.
00:48:47 That's correct, yes.
00:48:50 It had the most astounding version of that,
00:48:53 like embodiment of that I've ever seen.
00:48:56 Oh, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.
00:48:58 Oh, God, okay, well.
00:49:00 I've ever seen Rob Plays and Kevin are talking about,
00:49:05 it's a debate podcast, and they're talking about
00:49:07 like the merit of removing rides over preserving rides
00:49:11 and like how, you know, removing rides
00:49:12 allows for new rides to be made, which can also be good.
00:49:15 And Kevin's like, oh, no, you gotta keep
00:49:17 all the history, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:49:18 The point of that doesn't matter.
00:49:19 At one point, Rob, who's arguing to, you know,
00:49:21 get rid of rides as long as new rides take its placement
00:49:24 are also equally as good.
00:49:26 Kevin, this is something legendary.
00:49:29 So, Rob.
00:49:30 Kevin is the defunct leader, Kevin Perger.
00:49:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:49:34 So, Rob, you're not really accounting for theme
00:49:37 in a lot of these debates, you say that just
00:49:39 pure enjoyment is a lot of what it comes down to rides,
00:49:42 you know, you're fine with replacing rides
00:49:44 that may have historical, you know, thematic relevance,
00:49:46 but you know, as long as the new rides are fun,
00:49:47 you're fine with it.
00:49:48 So, in a lot of ways, are you saying that you're not
00:49:50 a theme park YouTuber, but rather an amusement park
00:49:54 YouTuber, the employment that amusement parks are like
00:49:58 dirt cheap e-fucks that are just like purely like four,
00:50:02 like the enjoyment, like your brain.
00:50:04 Hold the fuck on.
00:50:04 Yeah.
00:50:05 This is a, this is a lot, right?
00:50:07 This is some galaxy brain, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:50:09 No, you're right, this is a lot.
00:50:11 Yeah.
00:50:11 I don't even know how to.
00:50:13 Okay, no, it's so good.
00:50:14 I guess it's so good.
00:50:16 It makes sense, it makes sense in a weird fucked up way.
00:50:18 Well, I have some questions.
00:50:20 Sure.
00:50:21 I guess I never considered it, but like.
00:50:23 There's a difference, yeah.
00:50:24 So I guess amusement parks and theme parks
00:50:26 are not exactly the same thing.
00:50:28 Okay, so is what makes a theme park, then,
00:50:31 the fact that it has a theme?
00:50:34 Yeah, that it has a theme that it's,
00:50:35 and I imagine it's a very nebulous term that like
00:50:39 the parks themselves would use very interchangeably
00:50:41 because it doesn't really matter to them,
00:50:43 but like on like a nerd level,
00:50:45 like what determines a theme park is how much I think,
00:50:47 you know, yeah, theme is put into like what it's described
00:50:50 or what is inside of it,
00:50:52 and also maybe the level of artistry
00:50:53 would be sort of a nuanced way to take it.
00:50:55 Like, for instance, Michigan's Adventure,
00:50:58 I think no one could argue, like Google search it,
00:51:01 is anything but an amusement park,
00:51:03 because there's no theme to it other than the fact
00:51:05 that I guess it's in Michigan, it is the theme.
00:51:08 There's nothing to it, it just is a series of rides
00:51:10 that all, you know, it just is rides,
00:51:12 whereas Disneyland has very police of rides.
00:51:14 I mean, so none of those...
00:51:16 No, that's right, it's folks, right?
00:51:17 Because they have names that have like...
00:51:19 Some of the rides might have themes.
00:51:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:51:21 Does the theme, does the park itself overall
00:51:24 have to have a theme?
00:51:25 I think it would, right?
00:51:26 To have be a theme park, to have be a theme park.
00:51:29 Yeah.
00:51:29 I would have to think so.
00:51:30 Because like, because I mean like,
00:51:31 we go back to like the dawn of amusement parks,
00:51:33 and I think all rides have like a name.
00:51:35 Yeah.
00:51:36 So I guess, I'm guessing that all theme parks
00:51:37 are amusement parks,
00:51:38 but not all amusement parks are theme parks.
00:51:41 Yeah, that's a way to put it.
00:51:42 That's a way to put it, I would think.
00:51:44 But like, okay, the fact that he's so disparaging
00:51:47 of amusement park YouTubers as like a lesser class.
00:51:52 Like, they don't have to use their brain,
00:51:53 they're intellectual,
00:51:54 but they have all the artistry on display
00:51:55 with theme parks.
00:51:56 Dude, you fucking Kevin Bacon or whatever your name is,
00:52:01 you are a mere amusement park.
00:52:03 Like, you traffic in tawdry.
00:52:08 You traffic in cheap disposable schlock.
00:52:13 I am an art critique.
00:52:15 Listen, when I go to Disneyland,
00:52:16 I don't even ride the rides.
00:52:17 I just spend five hours in the queue
00:52:19 analyzing all of the various lore they've hidden
00:52:21 in the tapestries that is the wall
00:52:24 in Pirates of the Caribbean,
00:52:25 that has Johnny Depp's hideous facade
00:52:27 just etched in in stone on the side.
00:52:30 Well, I smell inside the bizarre smells and perfumes
00:52:36 that Disney puts into their rides,
00:52:37 which entire companies have tried to profit on
00:52:40 by selling perfumes that are scented
00:52:42 like Disneyland wet rides.
00:52:44 That's a real thing, look it up yours.
00:52:46 Disneyland red wide perfumes are a real thing.
00:52:50 That's something Jenny Nicholson would wear.
00:52:52 That is pretty fucked up.
00:52:53 And it's totally fucked up.
00:52:54 That's pretty fucked up a little bit.
00:52:55 It's a little bit like crazy.
00:52:57 Yeah.
00:52:58 But dude, it's great, right?
00:52:59 Like, whenever I wanted to spare it to my friends,
00:53:02 which I want to do all the time.
00:53:03 Yeah, of course.
00:53:04 What are friends for?
00:53:05 You're acting like a real amusement park YouTuber right now.
00:53:08 Like, I don't think you really have like the complexity,
00:53:11 the clearness of thought to understand what I'm trying to do.
00:53:13 Try appreciating nuance sometime, you fucking rude boy.
00:53:19 Like the cool, okay, please.
00:53:21 Make like a virgin Chad meme of like the amusement park
00:53:24 YouTuber versus the theme park YouTuber.
00:53:27 Like the idea of a theme park user, theme park YouTuber,
00:53:31 be like an absolute literal like brain dead maniac
00:53:35 who just like, I love to go fast.
00:53:37 I like when the rides are big.
00:53:39 I like to get flopped around on a fucking metal chair, please.
00:53:43 Like smash cut to like a man, like a dark oak,
00:53:47 like burning like a library in his fucking Playboy velvet
00:53:52 of Bathrobe, you know, smoking a cigar
00:53:55 and sipping champagne, you're like, hmm.
00:53:58 They're updating the queue for Tower of Terror soon.
00:54:02 I wonder who, what imagine they're going to apply to that job?
00:54:05 Like, will the new queue videos,
00:54:08 like will they finally shed light on like the origins
00:54:10 of the haunting?
00:54:11 Like when exactly did the bite of 83 take place?
00:54:16 You know what I'm saying?
00:54:18 Yeah, it's incredible.
00:54:22 Boy, so.
00:54:24 It's incredible.
00:54:25 You may have a distinction like that for R2K fans.
00:54:27 We didn't have like, we already have gameplay goons.
00:54:29 So we didn't have some sort of like other equivalent
00:54:32 for like the cultured thematic community member.
00:54:37 Yeah.
00:54:38 Like instead of players, it's community members, right?
00:54:40 Where it's like dirty, filthy community members.
00:54:42 No, no, no.
00:54:43 Nurses players like, Oh, you just played the game, dude.
00:54:46 You don't even engage, you aren't even inspired by like the setting.
00:54:50 You haven't even made a contest entry?
00:54:53 Yeah.
00:54:54 What are you doing?
00:54:57 The Virgin player in the Chad community member.
00:55:01 Yeah.
00:55:02 That's perfect.
00:55:03 That's pretty good.
00:55:05 Uh...
00:55:07 Dude, were you talking about Jenny Nicholson just a second ago? You mentioned her.
00:55:09 Yeah, hater.
00:55:11 Bronycon.
00:55:11 I've just, lately I've decided, you know what? I'm just gonna go whole hog.
00:55:14 I don't really have-
00:55:15 Just hate people for no reason.
00:55:16 I don't really have a solid reason, but like, why mince- why- why go half ass with it?
00:55:21 I just fuckin' hate her. I just- garbage. Terrible person.
00:55:24 I- why? I don't- just a feeling.
00:55:26 It was so funny at Bronycon. Like, there would be so many times where it's like, we would just be talking and be like,
00:55:31 Yep. Like, I hate- I hate Impossible a lot. Just hate her.
00:55:35 Yeah.
00:55:35 Just like, mention it out of the blue.
00:55:37 Yeah, and then you know what? All my preconceptions were confirmed when I actually talked to her.
00:55:41 Dude, okay. And she was the worst.
00:55:42 We talked about a few stories on the PC, but there were a few choice ones.
00:55:45 Dude, let's have another frog fractions where we just dunk on Brony people.
00:55:49 Dude, oh, that's what this is right now.
00:55:51 Yeah.
00:55:51 Uh, dude, okay.
00:55:53 Please, regale us with the story about how K.P. could try to get her- you into her discord.
00:55:57 Because it's insane.
00:55:58 It is insane.
00:55:59 It is- I mean, it's not as insane as the story.
00:56:01 It's as insane as the stuff Jesse said that she said, but I can't confirm the veracity of any of that.
00:56:04 Well, it's not like, eventful, but just like, the gall of it.
00:56:07 The unmitigated gall of what she's trying to like, do.
00:56:10 It's just a shitty way of fucking being.
00:56:12 It's- oh, oh, god. Is that a frenzy?
00:56:14 Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
00:56:16 Oh my fucking god.
00:56:17 Dude, this is what I want. I want that temple, dude.
00:56:19 I wanna buy that fucking temple, my other thing or my fucking-
00:56:21 I hope it's easy to MopUp come from your floor pit.
00:56:23 Cause I'm afraid that it's just been so-
00:56:25 Nothing could be easier.
00:56:27 Do it a-
00:56:28 Do it a- or more reward.
00:56:29 I do it for fun, honestly.
00:56:30 I'm afraid I'm you're gonna have to carry this stream for a minute because I'm fucking focused on clicking as hard as I can right now
00:56:37 That's fine. Listen, I understand the clicking frenzy
00:56:40 But it only comes down once a moon that you may be into dude. We got the timer
00:56:44 We've got more than half of this frenzy. I'm gonna get the temple dude
00:56:47 I'm gonna get the fucking temple.
00:56:47 The burning hole is so great because it was able to just like be so like it
00:56:52 It was almost refreshing and a bizarre like twisted sense
00:56:56 Which is like the human brain loves to have like like adversaries because if you don't have like a goal like something to
00:57:02 Like do or people to hate then like your brain doesn't know what to do and it feels like bliss like oh enjoy me like just pure pleasure
00:57:09 There's something wrong here. I'm not I'm not nature right now doesn't sound yeah. No. Thank you. Wait wait straight
00:57:16 Yeah, so like it was a bizarre pleasure being around people who you hate like exclusively
00:57:22 It was a weird like wow like it's a me against society
00:57:26 It's me against the entirety of everyone around me right now. Okay frenzy's over. I can I can discuss
00:57:33 It was it was weird just being around like
00:57:36 Just a sea of just insane people insane people's only can describe it. Um, oh yeah, kpk
00:57:43 So all right, so we're it's like the very end of the con
00:57:46 This is like right before closing ceremonies and we're just kind of making one last walk around the the vendors hall and we walk by
00:57:53 Some table somewhere and kp is there just packing up stuff
00:57:59 And uh, I don't want to talk to her
00:58:01 nothing
00:58:03 There's nothing I would less rather do
00:58:06 Um, but hippos like I'm gonna go say hi
00:58:09 So he just goes up walks up to her. I'm pretty sure he reckoned. She I'm almost positive. No, no she did she did
00:58:15 Yeah, yeah. Um, so, uh, and he says hi and she she like she turns to our group right me and uh, I think
00:58:22 Kazi was there. I think was me Kazi and hippo
00:58:24 I don't remember but she turns to like our whole group and she's after hippo says hi and she's like, oh, hey guys
00:58:30 You want to buy anything last minute? Which is you know, yeah fair fair question
00:58:34 And I think we're just like no we're we're no we're just you know
00:58:38 Just saying hi or whatever and she's and she's just like uh jumps right to uh, are you guys in the fan discord?
00:58:44 You should join the fan discord like
00:58:47 Not doesn't even want to talk to us. Just wants to shill her fucking fan discord
00:58:52 This is why this is why I knew it was a bad idea to engage
00:58:57 And maybe it was I don't know. I know I know it's not a big deal
00:59:00 But it's just like uh fuck this person. It well, it's a very like weird and like presumptuous thing
00:59:08 like
00:59:09 Oh, no, you know, I I think it's possible that in her in her mind like
00:59:13 The horseshoe crew and then you just like don't really matter don't really factor into her perception of humanity
00:59:19 Why would we yeah, sure
00:59:20 And so I think to her probably just like, you know, just another person just like oh, hey
00:59:25 You're you're someone who would be at brony con. Okay. Okay. Watch my stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I understand all that
00:59:30 But like the fact that like that's her fucking thing. Well, it's bad. Yeah. It's bad. Yeah, it's yeah
00:59:36 I'm not gonna excuse you because oh, well, like I'm just a peon. I'm not an I'm not an important person
00:59:41 So why would I expect her to fucking engage with me like a human being? Sure
00:59:46 It's fucked up man. It is fucked up. Dude. I cannot believe
00:59:51 The disrespect that brony con dealt to us. We didn't get a panel
00:59:55 Everyone treated us like we were fighting too big. I wasn't surprised. I wasn't surprised to not get a panel
01:00:00 Except that all the panels that I did see were such shit
01:00:03 And but like they were like literally who it's weak shit, man. I don't understand like why were these people allowed
01:00:12 To to exist. Why were they allowed to present their vision?
01:00:16 What's fucking lame we could we you know what we could have done it
01:00:19 Straber milk would have made the first public appearance since the frog fraction
01:00:23 I mean
01:00:24 I do you think maybe someone just dropped the ball like maybe someone meant to get back to you and then just like
01:00:29 Okay, I wonder sometimes but like like I did like send multiple emails
01:00:33 But I wonder if like I should just like really just fucking like
01:00:36 Pressed into them if that would have done anything like
01:00:40 If I just really should have just like stuck with it and just been like, hey, we're still here. Please respond to us
01:00:46 I mean
01:00:47 Surely someone would have read it and like well, I mean I'm sure there's someone already did read it and like you know
01:00:52 I mean, you know, maybe persistence does
01:00:55 Make the heart you'll find something is different sometimes being persistent like that can can get results
01:01:02 I mean, maybe it's possible that someone did in in fact intend for us to have a panel and we just slipped through the crags
01:01:08 I don't know. It's weird. It's really weird
01:01:13 Dude, you know who we did meet though was past analysis. How crazy is that like that guy?
01:01:17 I mean, is that really that surprising he was there? Well, okay, not surprising that he was there
01:01:22 But from my perspective, it was and he like mentioned like he like
01:01:26 Like played into this weird interpretation. I had with events and he also had it which was funny
01:01:32 I did not really talk to him at all. I just kind of sat high to him once or twice
01:01:35 Uh, it was funny these last
01:01:38 To quote wreck it Ralph from that one uh commercial where where they couldn't hire jc riley
01:01:45 To actually like a rip fries his role of a right Ralph
01:01:48 So just some random guy who didn't sound like wreck it Ralph to quote him last we spoke
01:01:52 Uh, me and past analysis were on like equal footing. He like far more
01:01:58 Culturally relevant in everyone's mind's eye than I am what back in the pony dance back in the pony days
01:02:03 Where me and we and me and him were both like, you know
01:02:06 Jokey and Lee referred to as the horseshoe crew CMC, you know, we were like just peripheral wait. Were you was that a thing?
01:02:13 That was a that was a real thing. Yeah, I totally forgot about that
01:02:16 Yeah, the real thing it was funny and me and him were on like, you know, just equal footing in that regard and then like
01:02:22 We like I see him now and I'm it's so desensitized to that idea of like, you know, it's just it's just it's just those guys
01:02:29 It's just the pcp who would even care
01:02:32 That's right. That's correct. And then he and then like one of the first things is
01:02:36 Everyone on one of the first things like, you know, we're talking and he's like so like how would you get in the pcp?
01:02:42 Like how'd you do like, what was your strat bro? How'd you do it? How'd you do it?
01:02:46 I was just persistent and they had no standards. That's right. There's no trick to it. You just have to keep doing it
01:02:54 There's nothing that they know is really no trick. Well, I'm gonna piss but I want to talk about how weird I am
01:03:00 Oh god, am I gonna have to carry it? Yeah, you're gonna have to do some work actually
01:03:05 I don't have any energy. I've sapped all my I was I told you I was already fucking
01:03:10 At zero energy before we we lifted and now we've lifted here. Oh my god. Is that a frenzy?
01:03:16 No, it's a bunch of you talk about how good your deals are from Aldi and how they
01:03:20 Dude, Aldi's got the best fucking deal on
01:03:23 Here's my here's my here's the here are the things viewers that are the best deal at Aldi that I buy
01:03:30 heavy cream
01:03:31 cauliflower
01:03:32 sausage
01:03:33 bacon
01:03:34 gridlock energy
01:03:36 avocados
01:03:37 chicken breast
01:03:38 ground flags
01:03:40 and mayonnaise
01:03:42 Now on the contrary here are the things that are the best deal from costco
01:03:46 And the theme of these is generally that like things you can buy in like big bulk, right?
01:03:50 Like things that you get in like a large amount at a time
01:03:53 So peanut butter get like two of the big jars like
01:03:57 Tape together in like a fucking a lot of things from costco or like two containers taped together
01:04:03 This is sort of a thing. This is true of peanut butter and the second thing on the list
01:04:07 mozzarella bags of shredded mozzarella also big blocks of cheddar
01:04:12 bags of almonds and my favorite almond flour
01:04:15 Which is what I used to make my legendary keto pizza
01:04:18 Which everyone agrees is the best on the block and then finally
01:04:23 The things you can get from
01:04:24 Wegmans, which are the best deal the list is short
01:04:27 francs
01:04:28 And pepperoni now the pepperoni is the best deal because they sell these
01:04:33 Giant ass bags of it and all this is is um
01:04:36 In terms of like cost per unit cost per volume, right?
01:04:39 So pepperoni Wegmans you think costco would do it, but they don't
01:04:42 Wegman sells the biggest cheapest bags of pepperoni by volume the francs
01:04:46 They sell these this this kind of hot dog called bar s
01:04:51 At Wegmans and they are dog shit. They actually have they have carbs in them. I don't know why they're fucking made with like
01:04:57 They're made with some sort of like wheat germ fucking runoff or something. I don't know they're crap, but they are the cheapest
01:05:02 It's like a buck 20 for a packet of hot dogs great deal
01:05:06 But they're a little too carby
01:05:07 They have there's an all beef variety, but those aren't as cheap and it's a fucking tragedy. Hey munchie. You're back
01:05:13 I'm back. Did you just feel it just get about how could your deals are now you mapped out?
01:05:17 I was just I was just informing. Yeah, I'm reading off
01:05:19 I have a list pinned to my wall of like what the best deals are and where to get them
01:05:23 Is that wf Whole Foods?
01:05:26 Yeah, and and nothing is not yeah, I am because
01:05:31 Okay, well because I was laying it all out. Yeah thinking that maybe some things would be a better deal at Whole Foods
01:05:36 No, no, no, nothing. Nothing. Whole Foods, dude. Yeah. No, absolutely. Oh, that's so
01:05:42 It's so funny that like you have these like well populated columns like very like like meticulously like Wegmans is a little sparse
01:05:49 Sure, but whatever the point is that you've like gone like really troubled like like perfectly
01:05:54 Calculate all of like these like the best deals at like a variety of stores and there's one column for Whole Foods
01:05:59 Which just is completely empty. You know what the killer though is what the killer is that um
01:06:05 Like a lot of the margin on some of these things
01:06:09 Like on Costco, it's generally worth it. But like on like Aldi and Wegmans
01:06:14 Aldi's looks so good
01:06:15 If I'm like if I'm going there in person like if I'm taking the bus and not just ordering it on instacart
01:06:22 Some of the margins are so small that like literally the bus fare offsets it and doesn't fucking matter
01:06:27 Yeah, but if I'm or but generally these days I order it with instacart
01:06:31 So whatever I'll save like a couple of bucks. I'll save a couple of bucks instacart
01:06:34 I gotta get on that shit instacart is really great. It's it costs like 90 dollars a year
01:06:40 for like free delivery
01:06:42 And like that in terms of like time saved that absolutely pays for itself as far as I wait how much for your 90 dollars
01:06:49 That's nothing bro. Yeah, no just in terms of fucking bus fare on like a year
01:06:54 Yeah, that's crazy for a whole year. I mean
01:06:58 You got to tip the driver. I mean you don't have to tip the driver
01:07:01 But you should probably tip the driver at least a couple bucks. So it's not
01:07:05 Okay, I trip for a while
01:07:07 I wasn't tipping the driver and then I realized that these are fucking poor people in that like this is the
01:07:13 You know, this is just fucking uber for groceries. This is like a fuck these people don't get benefits
01:07:18 They are being this is like exploits. This is absolute. This is the worst kind of exploitation of labor and I was like
01:07:26 If anyone deserves it these people probably fucking deserve a tip
01:07:29 So I fucking so I tip them like they're recommended two dollars or whatever. It's not much. I don't know whatever
01:07:34 so I pay that
01:07:35 and then
01:07:37 You know a fucking but other than that
01:07:40 It's totally worth it. It's totally I mean a company like this
01:07:43 I'm sure it lives and dies on people that like sign up for the service and then forget that they have it
01:07:48 It's like a gym, right? Like gyms don't want you to use their services gyms want you to sign up for a membership and then stop going
01:07:55 Yeah, that's there is actually that's what costco does too
01:07:58 Oh
01:07:59 Maybe the best thing about instacart is that they just have people with costco memberships that will shop at costco for you
01:08:04 You don't have like the thing about costco
01:08:07 You need a bizarre like membership card. They costco makes all its money on memberships
01:08:12 They don't make money selling their products
01:08:14 So now you can just go you can get someone else to go in there and buy your shit for cheap
01:08:19 And you don't have to buy the membership like fuck you
01:08:22 Oh, do you want to talk about this?
01:08:24 Oh, sure. Yeah, dude. Oh my god. Okay. I I I just as I always do when ben's rallying off about god knows what
01:08:30 I did my mind started to wander. Yeah. Yeah, my mind starts to wander. I just started looking around just how I just upgraded milk
01:08:34 Dude, my milk just turned chocolate. Oh my god. Wow, ben. I'm so impressed. Fuck. Yeah. You want me to dunk the cookie?
01:08:39 Dude, hell, yeah, I oh god
01:08:43 Uh, that's fucking ridiculous and stupid. Did you get an achievement for it? Achievement unlocked cookie dunker
01:08:51 That's insane. Yeah, right. I just literally is
01:08:54 I started picking up things on his desk and once we see what a tiny little beautiful pen
01:09:00 Of infinite jest. Yeah, the very one that vincent was holding. That's right. Vapors two. Do you want to tell me what's going on with this
01:09:07 Pen? That's the pen for the Vapors two Kickstarter
01:09:10 What there's going to be a kickstarter for Vapors two. I love that show
01:09:14 I've I've been saying I've been every now and then I'll say like, oh, yeah, it's gonna happen soon
01:09:18 It's gonna happen soon. I'm really trying to actually make it happen. Like actually soon like, um, I wrote
01:09:24 I need the thing that I need to do is I need to write the vaporettes because I I need some fucking guest content
01:09:29 And uh, I was writing I wrote half a script. Uh, yesterday
01:09:34 Yeah, I'm hopefully after this is done. I want to try and finish writing that script before I go to bed
01:09:39 Uh, mm-hmm
01:09:41 Two things. Okay. First of all
01:09:43 Vaporettes, you'll see some more art from me. Yeah, probably less
01:09:47 Long, but if you liked my last one, then you're finally like this one too. And obviously Vapors. I mean
01:09:51 You did go above and beyond and draw a lot of pages
01:09:54 I mean, I would welcome as much as possible because like
01:09:58 The thing about Vapors two is that it's actually quite a bit shorter than than uh
01:10:04 This grandma's name is patreona and she's 101 years old. Well, they all have a they all have names. What the fuck?
01:10:11 Yeah, I did not know that this one's name is dan heinous peanut
01:10:15 Miss mischievous miss mischievous. Yeah. Yeah. Mima ivy. Okay. This is new. I didn't know about this
01:10:21 Looky, looky, looky
01:10:22 Frenzy. Oh my god. I can't talk about my business. I can't talk about the art that I created. Oh guys have to click
01:10:28 I have to make I have to click things too
01:10:31 Oh my fucking god
01:10:34 But yeah, um, you know, all just as you were saying only poor
01:10:38 Exploited, you know uber drivers and instacart workers all those poorer people with foreign accents and
01:10:45 Fuck them hate them. Have got to go the fuck back to wherever it is
01:10:48 They've all come over fresh on the boat from old country and they all start panning your door when the bin sing the vapor
01:10:54 I need bin sing vapor god. I just wish they would go back to old country already
01:10:58 I back in the old country. We do not have bin sing the vapor
01:11:02 We cannot get that when will you release new bin sing vapor? Well, you motherfuckers you fucking foreigners get ready
01:11:08 For this shit. It's gonna be so dude
01:11:10 I I think you posted it in either on twitter or in the pcb chat or somewhere
01:11:16 The the new cover
01:11:17 Yeah, I posted it. I made a tweet where I showed the two books side to side back next week. Do you have the prototype?
01:11:24 Yeah, you want to see it?
01:11:27 This frenzy's almost over. Okay. Oh my god, dude. Hell. Yeah, I want to see that
01:11:32 Yeah, I'm gonna I want to go out and like take some like funny pictures with it or something
01:11:37 Um, it's gonna be pretty good
01:11:39 I was thinking like a picture of it in a trash can the way that infinite jest winds up in a trash can spoilers
01:11:45 Wow
01:11:51 Let's watch this has red bin sing the vapor at least oh my god, it's beautiful. Yeah looks pretty oh my god
01:11:58 Well, actually the language pretty inconsistent actually it's the first one. So yeah, so it's pretty bad
01:12:02 Is it inconsistent? Well, it's just a different widths. Uh, simply well, I guess
01:12:08 Uh, no, frankly, I don't see what you're talking about
01:12:11 You have to but you'll have you'll have to buy the comic books and judge. Yeah judge for yourself
01:12:16 I I thought this was the back cover for there. I'm gonna be really honestly. I should have
01:12:21 It's a for the viewers at home. It's a flyer for the cablam. Which is just the printing service
01:12:26 Um, I probably should have done that because they will like take money off. Okay
01:12:32 Okay, so the thing about there's a lot of like filler pages in there that are just one page repeated over and over again
01:12:37 Just to sort of make it because it's gonna be full of like guest content. Um
01:12:42 Look at that
01:12:43 Yeah, you should definitely go from a thing with like just flipping through these. This is so funny. Who made this?
01:12:49 Uh, the artist's name is fennel ketanurix
01:12:53 That person made a vaporite, which they all are probably aware of. Yeah, it's the one with the sword. Yeah, and um, it's just
01:12:59 Be careful. Be careful. Be very ginger. Be very ginger. It's just that repeat from many a page
01:13:04 It's just like a third of the book is just that page over into that one page vaporite over and over again
01:13:10 Is this the same is this repeat from the this forward? Yeah. Yeah the forward is it's yeah
01:13:15 What's it like trying to print something?
01:13:18 um
01:13:21 Stressful it's stressful. Just like getting everything. Um
01:13:26 Because like to give you templates and it's it's stressful
01:13:28 Just like getting all your pages like sorted and like
01:13:32 Converted to the right file type and at the right resolution and like it's really stressful like before you send it in
01:13:37 It's like, oh, did I did I do it all right? Like did I
01:13:41 Did I have the pages all in order is like did I did I switch anything around to something upside down?
01:13:45 It's actually kind of a nightmare for a pro tub like this. How much is it running out?
01:13:50 Oh, just for the one. Yeah, I think it was like $11. Oh, that's that's not bad. No, no
01:13:55 um
01:13:56 And of course like it's cheaper the more you print. Yeah
01:14:00 specific specifically the kablam
01:14:02 Gives you a price break at like 500 dude. Well right here. It's just one one one. It's $11. Oh my god
01:14:07 I didn't even realize it's $11 and 11 cents. That's crazy. Yeah, does that include shipping? Yeah, cool. Okay
01:14:15 Yeah, well, there's there's the answer to your question. I guess that's insane
01:14:19 Pretty good. I can't do it. Oh my god
01:14:22 You've you've got such a you've got such an empire below your feet
01:14:25 Then you've got such a like a wealth of comics and stuff that you're able to like print out with these cool ass
01:14:31 Fucking four fans for for a hardcore vape heads vape heads to declubber up dude. This is fucking sick
01:14:38 You're gonna sign them again. Yeah
01:14:40 Oh, yeah, sure. I'll offer sign copies again. Uh, definitely probably at the same same. I'm just I'm
01:14:46 I'm gonna just do it like it's gonna be the exact same as the last one
01:14:50 But there's gonna be like additional options for if like you also want to get like the the original and you want to get like
01:14:57 You know the the the book or the pin from the first one like that'll be available
01:15:01 It's like a bundle thing if you want both
01:15:04 If you missed it the first time or whatever and it's actually kind of um
01:15:09 It's just kind of confusing trying to think of like price points and like how much should I
01:15:14 God okay
01:15:16 Picking picking how much deciding how much something should cost is horrible. You ever done it?
01:15:22 No, basically never. It sucks. It's like you there's there's no there's no right answer
01:15:27 You can't like look it up. You can't google like how much should I charge for this?
01:15:31 There's like there's nothing to go on except got feeling
01:15:34 Like you don't want to like overcharge because you don't want to fuck over your people
01:15:37 And also it won't even sell that much
01:15:39 Also, you want to undersell these, you know, it's your work and you don't want to fucking just you know
01:15:43 Yeah
01:15:44 Yeah, I mean the last Kickstarter was pretty successful. So I'm just gonna copy
01:15:49 I'm just gonna copy over the prices from that pretty much. I feel like don't fix what isn't broken sure
01:15:56 Now
01:15:57 If we could talk business for a second here, I'm interested because
01:16:02 I've always thought that the champion
01:16:05 Makes the most sense as like you're sort of like
01:16:08 Main
01:16:09 Thing that you that you say like yes, I've been saying I'm making this web comic called the champion. It's very
01:16:16 Good, but also kind of I don't know. She is
01:16:19 Easily accessible because sort of mainstream in a way very like a lot of why that's sort of why I started doing it because I was like
01:16:26 You know, I should think of a story that maybe has a little more obvious appeal
01:16:30 Where's my fucking jewel dog? What did you do? Did you pocket it?
01:16:35 Uh, I know you've always no, I know you've always coveted my jewel
01:16:41 Wait, hold on. Oh god, what's this fucking fucking cookie? Okay, it's just the lucky. That's fine. Uh, your phone's over there. Uh
01:16:48 You know the cotton the cotton I can't I can't I can't work like this look. I can't work under these jeweless conditions. Okay
01:16:55 I probably just like put it down behind here here sniff this been. Oh sniff a pen. Yeah sniff a pen
01:17:00 That's that'll get me there quick. Look at me there. You know, look at me split
01:17:06 Here here smoke this bro. Just just put this in your room. What happens all the time? I offered him a battery for those
01:17:13 Uh, this happens every fucking day
01:17:15 But I stand up and I look at the ground and I think where's my jewel
01:17:20 I didn't I haven't left the right here right here. Oh, dude. Oh dropped it when I was uh going for the copy
01:17:25 What was I talking about? I bet would you have the champion being more mainstream? Yeah. Yeah. I listen Ben
01:17:31 Yeah, okay. So I just please lay out to me. Yep. What do you do right now?
01:17:35 And this isn't like a oh, why aren't you making comments like like literally like I wanted this
01:17:39 It ties into more things like so you do your comics. You do your streams. What else?
01:17:44 What else would you consider like a thing that you do? Um
01:17:48 Lately I've been I've actually been spending a lot of time like fucking around with um
01:17:54 pins like rfc cape that for the like
01:17:57 I've been I I've
01:17:59 I sort of spent a long time
01:18:02 Kind of fucking around with a slime coin design to make it to try and like get it
01:18:06 You know
01:18:07 Because like you can't fit too many fine details into a pin design
01:18:10 So I've been like reducing the amount of detail to sort of make it more
01:18:14 Ben if there's one thing that you do that is your greatest folly
01:18:18 When you're making merch you get way fucking like
01:18:22 Too into it and like yeah, that's you like
01:18:26 Fucked around with like the shirts a lot with I spent like a week and a half
01:18:30 Yeah, just fucking around with like the shirts in the storefronts. Yeah, I did um
01:18:35 Kind of insane. Yeah, it was stupid. Well what I meant more broadly was just like what could you consider your ongoing products?
01:18:41 They have right now. I don't know would you consider like pin making one of your main projects? I wouldn't think so
01:18:45 Not a main project. That's not a thing that I'm planning to do for a long time. Sure. Well, okay, but your ongoing work
01:18:51 Oh, I'm scattered. I feel it's I'm scattered and this is like my big problem is that I um, I can't I don't focus on one thing and I'm kind of
01:19:00 Oh, okay
01:19:01 Well, well, I was back to doing beast capades for a hot minute there, but then brony con happens
01:19:07 I came back. I had sort of lost focus on it now what I mean
01:19:10 I'm gonna go back to beast capades what I'm
01:19:12 Okay, I'll tell you right at this very moment what I'm trying to focus on is getting the scripts done
01:19:17 For the vapor ads and then starting up the vapors to Kickstarter and then while that's running
01:19:23 I'm going to go back to doing beast capades. You misunderstand what I mean and
01:19:27 Maybe easy to do so
01:19:28 Specifically, like I don't like I don't mean like like like a to-do list of what you're like. Oh, I'm gonna do this
01:19:34 This in this order
01:19:35 I must have checked out this before on like an other rfck or maybe on a pcp or maybe just people in general
01:19:40 But I think what has helped me so much with like work ethic is like
01:19:46 Getting a clear sense of what I want to do like not just like what I'm going to do like oh tomorrow
01:19:51 I work on this tomorrow. I work on this it will be just like like a list of all my
01:19:57 Projects that genuinely care about and all the other bullshit can be just swept to the side because I'm focusing my efforts on like seriously like
01:20:05 two or three
01:20:06 Projects match. I can have like a little bit of like, you know, maybe a little bit extra
01:20:10 You know side projects here and there but like my mind is focused upon a very small set of things
01:20:17 And I want to because it does seem like you're very scattered
01:20:19 You kind of like there's a lot of things that you want to do in various different like way
01:20:23 You know to different levels of interest to you and your audience
01:20:26 But I want to know I don't want to know like what you're going to do tomorrow
01:20:30 I want to know like what do you in your mind? I was like screaming for some reason
01:20:34 What do you in your mind think of as like your projects?
01:20:38 What like to like if someone were to ask you what do you all do Ben? What like what do you do?
01:20:44 It'd be I mean from my feel like you could probably answer this question
01:20:49 I could probably answer this for you, but I think this is that complicated
01:20:52 It's not common, but it's a helpful exercise
01:20:54 I think too like maybe you might want to reduce things in order to become more focused on the stuff
01:20:58 Because it seems like you are indeed scared so from my perspective as someone who doesn't you know
01:21:03 Who follows your patreon?
01:21:05 It was a pretty you know active into it you do your comics in sort of a you know
01:21:11 Whatever suits your fancy at the moment
01:21:13 Bases, you know it kind of bounced back and forth from a lot of things you do your comics you do streams
01:21:19 And then I do do the stream and and then it gets kind of muddy where it's like you kind of make videos
01:21:24 I guess
01:21:26 I haven't thought yeah, I was gonna
01:21:29 Oh, I said I was gonna make another video at some point
01:21:32 I said I was gonna make a video that was gonna own the cuck servatives
01:21:36 and I still
01:21:38 And I would kind of still like to do that, but I sort of lost my nerve halfway through making it
01:21:43 And like wasn't sure what I wanted the tone to be and just put it aside and never picked it back up again
01:21:50 Uh, I don't know. I'm not thinking about videos these days
01:21:52 Okay, so I mean that that's where it sort of gets my words like there's a lot of like things that you could do
01:21:58 And there's a lot of like, you know like things you have done before but like what matters to you right now
01:22:02 You know like what like what are the things that you want to like push as thing you're doing?
01:22:06 Because you know
01:22:07 Is it just streams and comics is that where you want to put all I don't want to push my streams like I that's not a
01:22:13 That's not like that's not like something to like
01:22:16 base my brand on but think about them. They're the most consistent things that you make
01:22:21 And the most frequent
01:22:24 And maybe the thing that people consume the longest
01:22:27 uh
01:22:29 Yeah, and
01:22:30 I mean just because you know, like I'm just saying that they are like a big
01:22:34 Part I mean in a lot of people's minds everything. I mean, there are a lot of my mind when I think about what does Ben do?
01:22:38 Well, I know he streams a lot. I stream like once a week. Well, I mean very consistent. I mean, it's not bad
01:22:45 It's not like oh, it's just streamer like I mean that kind of seems bad
01:22:48 Like that's my goal is not to be a streamer. Well
01:22:52 I mean, I mean part-time occasional like it's
01:22:56 I mean, that's fine and all
01:22:58 No
01:22:59 That twitch is just a thing that I do on the side
01:23:03 It's in no way is it meant to be like my main thing or even a main thing
01:23:08 um
01:23:10 So so there so there
01:23:13 So there you have it. So it's all just you you just want to exclusively do comics
01:23:17 I
01:23:19 Wanted my main. Yeah, I wanted my main thing to be comics. Yeah
01:23:22 um
01:23:23 You say want it. Well, I feel like I haven't followed through on that but you know
01:23:31 That's why like when you ask me like what do I want to do the answer is well one
01:23:35 Vapors to Kickstarter then Biscuits
01:23:39 After that, um
01:23:42 Fuck I gotta buy this temple after that, um probably
01:23:47 Uh
01:23:49 I mean
01:23:51 We'd have to see champion
01:23:53 Yeah, I mean
01:23:56 Biscuits will probably take a little while to finish like a couple months
01:24:00 Um, so like I mean I could change my mind, but yeah, I guess tentatively the plan after finishing Biscuits would be go back to doing champion
01:24:08 Hmm. Okay. Okay. Would there ever be a scenario
01:24:14 under which like
01:24:16 You release champion
01:24:19 And it's not as though it's like
01:24:22 You are switching off between vapors and bcpades and champion
01:24:27 And then you release all all of three of those at like, you know in big chunks aside from basically is obviously which is you know
01:24:32 More flea throwing there would be a scenario where it's like I could like say hey my friend ben
01:24:37 He does the web account called the champion. He releases like every two weeks or something like a new page or something
01:24:43 Every two a page every two weeks
01:24:46 Uh, yes, would would you ever consider that as a thing you do? Yeah, yeah
01:24:51 I kind of want to like finish Biscuits
01:24:54 I don't have any like
01:24:56 I don't have any like, um
01:25:00 I think I've told you this before I don't have like a vapors for in my head. Yes, you have so
01:25:06 Yeah, I guess the idea is like
01:25:08 You know, I'll I'll keep like, you know kick starting like the physical prints of my old stuff
01:25:12 But that's like kind of it's its own thing in terms of like what I'm actively working on
01:25:18 Uh, I would finish Biscuits and then it would just be champion would basically be it unless like
01:25:24 Something were to strike me and I was like, okay
01:25:26 I want to take a break from this and like maybe go back for a minute and do another champion or another vapors thing
01:25:33 but like
01:25:34 Yeah, my my my end goal is
01:25:36 To work on the champion. My end goal is to make the champion the thing that I do. Yeah. Yeah
01:25:43 That's that that's that's good. I'm happy about that
01:25:46 I feel that's I've always wanted maybe maybe the audience wouldn't feel the same way
01:25:50 Where it's just a very clear idea of like what you're trying to push is like the thing that you do
01:25:56 You've been very you're but you've been a very renaissance man. I think that's even really a problem. It's just a very
01:26:01 I mean you were you started like the Winnie the Pooh series and that was like the height of like
01:26:05 Okay, like what is been saying
01:26:09 Like what's going on here? Yeah, um
01:26:12 Not even that they were bad. Like I just I just like I thought it would I thought it would get a big audience and it didn't
01:26:18 um
01:26:20 I don't
01:26:22 I mean I think I mean my goal. I mean I want to grow my audience. That's what I that's what I want
01:26:28 I mean, I think the way you do that in the way that would be best for you is just to yeah
01:26:33 Just have like a main flagship comic series and you probably you know, no, you're probably right. No, no, you're you're right
01:26:41 You're probably right about that. It's hard
01:26:43 Uh, I don't know. I mean I want to you know, you see you got to try new things, right?
01:26:48 Find out what works for you. I don't know
01:26:51 Biscopades was like very different in tone and like
01:26:56 I mean Maryweather tells me that like you gotta
01:26:58 Like people are reading comics online. You got to do them
01:27:02 You got to do comics in like webtoon format and like I think he's not wrong
01:27:07 um
01:27:09 I don't
01:27:12 I sort of feel hopeless when I think about webtoons like when I think about like building an audience on like
01:27:18 To pastic or or well, I mean to I think to pastic's dying but like um
01:27:23 Webtoon or something that's just sort of feels like so Sisyphean and like I'm so behind on it
01:27:27 Like it'll just never happen. I don't know. It's also like very like
01:27:31 New and different from what you're doing, right? So it's very like it's sort of a new paradigm and like you would have to
01:27:37 Maybe like not change like the core of what you're doing at all
01:27:40 But like, you know, there'd be a lot of stuff like structural changes you have to make like it'd be like it's literally like a different format
01:27:45 Literally like the images are displayed in a different way. Yeah
01:27:49 but like
01:27:50 I don't know
01:27:51 I mean
01:27:53 Honestly, it's probably just better in every way
01:27:57 like formatting a page is kind of
01:28:00 a hassle
01:28:01 like fitting panels
01:28:03 like webtoon you just fucking just
01:28:06 Draw it one after another top to bottom like don't even worry about it. And I mean
01:28:11 That's not I mean you can get creative with the layout of a webtoon. You like you absolutely can do that. Um
01:28:17 Uh, you know
01:28:20 It would kind of suck to not be able to make books
01:28:24 People like books
01:28:27 Do they like books so much that it's not that it's worth hamstringing your online audience? I mean
01:28:34 Maybe but probably not. Yeah
01:28:40 I don't know like I'm not I don't I don't I'm not a purist or I'm not a
01:28:45 I'm not married to any particular format. I think I've said this before
01:28:49 I'll fucking I don't know
01:28:51 It's sort of I mean the world
01:28:54 It's sort of weird to think like oh chapter one of the champion would be entirely in like this page form
01:28:59 And then like the rest would be in this like non-page like webtoon form, but like
01:29:05 Who gives a shit? Yeah. Yeah, I don't think that would attract like anyone. I don't think it would fucking be a big deal really
01:29:12 Mm-hmm
01:29:13 People would probably
01:29:15 If if everything worked out
01:29:17 Well, and then like it got really popular or something then like people would just say like oh, yeah
01:29:22 The first chapters in this really shitty format that like is really annoying to read
01:29:27 But then it gets but then he fixes it
01:29:30 Which like, okay, that's fine
01:29:33 I mean at least there would be at that point there would be people who like are into it in that new way
01:29:38 That's that's what matters, you know, yeah
01:29:41 Um, it's it's in such a funny predicament that I'm in because it like on a whole lot of these are
01:29:47 These on all of these rfck's it's always me asking you like what are you doing?
01:29:51 And then the obvious question is like what am I doing? It's funny because it's like
01:29:55 A secret what I'm doing to only the people listening to this way podcast. Is it a secret? Well
01:30:02 No, what I mean by that is like to describe in detail what I'm working on right now
01:30:07 Would be to give away the surprise of what's happening
01:30:11 Like in the game in oh
01:30:14 Oh, I understand. I understand what you're saying. Yeah
01:30:18 So it's like it's it's in a funny like fucked scenario where it's like
01:30:23 Like
01:30:25 All of today I would like really ride very passionately about a thing that will be released and like a new sort of
01:30:32 section of
01:30:34 The slime corp stuff that'll be released soon and like I want to talk about it
01:30:39 But it's also like well like I'm only hurting the people who it's for like on the pcb
01:30:44 It might even be different where it's like I would talk about like more general kind of broad details
01:30:49 But like it would only be like bad for like the people who this
01:30:55 Show is targeted to and like that these are the people that you want it to be a secret from
01:31:01 Exactly. Yeah, sure. And like I'm like
01:31:05 I mean everyone maybe probably scoff because you know, I have been so inactive lately because of the month
01:31:11 I've just had but like I mean you've been you've really had a lot of real life stuff going on
01:31:16 Yeah, like genuinely you've had like you just moved across the country and all that
01:31:20 Oh, well, they don't care about that. All they know is that they aren't getting I care about that. I understand
01:31:25 I understand
01:31:28 But yeah, it's it's just like funny
01:31:31 Because I'm like exclusively working on like in this war as like the thing that I do now
01:31:35 Which is cool and great and like I'm excited about it
01:31:38 But it's also like, you know, I had kind of weird to talk about I had the kind of in like awkward
01:31:42 I hate I hate this. I kind of hate talking about this. I kind of have to stop doing that because it
01:31:48 Wasn't making me money. Yeah, nobody was like and the people that were
01:31:52 The people that were giving me money on patreon like that wasn't what they were doing it for and like
01:31:57 My patreon has dipped a bit and it really
01:32:02 Man, I don't know how to say that I want to sound I want to say this as diplomatically as possible
01:32:06 It really stresses me out
01:32:09 I don't want to say this in a way that's like you you viewer
01:32:12 You person who maybe someone unpatriated me who's listening right now
01:32:16 And I don't want to say like fuck you
01:32:19 What's your problem? It's fine. I'm grateful that you ever supported me at all
01:32:25 But like oh man the fact that it's going down really fucking gives me the fear
01:32:30 Yeah, you know what I mean. Yeah
01:32:32 Yeah, it's
01:32:35 I mean we were talking about this like off air talking about like
01:32:38 Monetizing writer first coplers and we both agree that like it first and foremost is like an art project that we just like I mean
01:32:45 like
01:32:46 I think going back to the start we wouldn't like stop doing our
01:32:50 In this war knowing that it would make money. I mean obviously we would try and make it so that it does but like
01:32:56 We're really happy with the way that it's turned out. We don't want to like gouge out anyone
01:33:00 But also is a consideration that like, you know
01:33:03 With you and with me we're both going to have like me like with school and you just now
01:33:09 Are going to have things that are like far more demand our attention that like have more like
01:33:14 Not just like even the monetary rewards, but just like are maybe even just more fulfilling in a lot of ways
01:33:20 And it's like how can we justify doing endless war in some circumstances?
01:33:24 And I'll always like you can because like it makes so little money and like, you know, it's kind of like slimy
01:33:31 It's a little bit gross a little bit dirty to talk about but like, you know
01:33:36 We do it anyway because we care and we like it a lot. I don't think anyone could like question our like interest in it
01:33:43 I mean in the beginning. I mean you were just going fucking crazy
01:33:46 I mean you would dedicate your entire life to doing this for uh pretty pretty much
01:33:52 Yeah, and me with all the recent story arcs and all the updates and stuff. I mean
01:33:58 It's it's we love endless. All right, but it just is like wrong for us to do so
01:34:06 like
01:34:07 We've got a no sort of pragmatic sense. Yeah, like like we've gotten no benefit from it. I mean
01:34:14 Yeah, I mean a lot of the time people seem to just like hate it like at least I don't know how
01:34:22 Well, okay, I mean
01:34:25 Your your volume like gradually creeps up so occasionally I'm gonna be like hey you crept up creep it down
01:34:31 We gotta wind down by like I have to leave soon
01:34:34 Oh, do you have a time limit? Yeah, I do it feels like we just started it's in two minutes
01:34:39 Really? Yeah
01:34:42 Don't worry guys, this is gonna happen way more often. Let's just like just do this like again
01:34:44 Like why not just like the part this is part one of a thing
01:34:48 Why no part two will come back. Okay. Well next time we'll have the dramatic conclusion. Will
01:34:54 Will I be able to afford a wizard tower?
01:34:56 Find out next time. I just want to say that like
01:34:59 Oh god, what was I fucking talking about? I was thinking about oh
01:35:01 For me like I come in and the game just feels like everyone is like unhappy with like everything that's happened
01:35:08 Oh, I mean, yeah, it was always like yeah, honestly, I feel like it's less like that now
01:35:12 I mean there were there were like crises points were like
01:35:15 I mean you remember you remember the times when the game was just completely broken
01:35:20 And like especially in the in the beginning this this this really weighed on crack. I think like all the like that there was a lot of
01:35:27 Criticism there was a lot of like oh this this part of the game sucks like this part of the game is not good
01:35:32 Uh, and like I mean it was probably mostly true
01:35:38 Uh, I mean, you know, it's it's perpetually a work. I don't think that anyone was like wrong for doing so
01:35:43 You know, I kind of like
01:35:45 That it is sort of a little bit janky
01:35:48 Oh, that's not well. Yes, but that's not what I was gonna say. I really kind of like that it has become
01:35:53 Something that is sort of not like open source, but something that like a lot of people work on
01:35:58 Yeah, that it's like the creation of the game itself has sort of become like a community project in a way. Yeah
01:36:04 Yeah, I
01:36:06 That's just
01:36:08 I think that's great. That's like what
01:36:11 That kind of feels like how it should be
01:36:14 What is that? Oh, it's a cat's millionaire or something. Oh
01:36:18 weird
01:36:19 Yeah, fuck fuck you. I guess uh
01:36:23 What what are you gonna get it's cat's millionaire? Nothing. Okay. I don't care
01:36:28 uh
01:36:29 But yeah, it's it's it's funny because it's like
01:36:32 A
01:36:33 Hot stove top that I really love
01:36:36 Like I love like like I love
01:36:40 Endless war in all ways the setting like the game itself and the community around it
01:36:46 I love it and then like I I wake up in the morning and I go to I check the discord messages
01:36:51 It's all people saying that the game sucks and they hate me personally and I'm like, yeah, I love this
01:36:56 And then she's my big counter and she's plummeting just going just nowhere because I'm spending all my time working on this war
01:37:02 I'm like, yeah, I love this and it's just like it's so funny of a particular event to be in because like I'm not gonna stop
01:37:08 I mean even in college like I think the one thing that it will continue to do is be in endless war because I just love it so much
01:37:15 But it's like so like, you know
01:37:18 It's not like
01:37:20 It's not good for me pragmatically as you said. This is um, this is I've been
01:37:25 Yeah, I mean, um
01:37:28 He's been been stressing lately about
01:37:30 feeling like I'm
01:37:32 Going nowhere in life. Dude. Okay an endless endless as much as I love endless sports
01:37:37 I don't want to say it's going nowhere. It's not going it's going places. But like is it where is it taking me? Yeah
01:37:43 You know, I mean, I mean, that's the whole reason. I mean
01:37:47 been like
01:37:48 Metaphorically and like literally in a long ways can't afford to be the non absentee father he used to be, you know
01:37:56 It's not a matter of like he doesn't care dude. Okay, bin. I'm just gonna fucking suck your dick for a second here
01:38:02 Please
01:38:04 Wait, where's the next one?
01:38:06 Where's
01:38:09 Oh, this whatever keep going cookie chains dog shit. Okay, uh, it
01:38:14 Oh
01:38:15 People will always like fucking like oh ben's never here. Ha ha ha. It's like fucking bad for the game. Whatever. Yeah, okay
01:38:21 Ha ha very easy for you to say this motherfucker
01:38:24 It's not a matter of interest level because he'll spend so much time just fiddly around with the most useless shit
01:38:31 About pens and he like styles his own
01:38:34 Personal stream to be that of endless wars aesthetic. He awfully cares about it
01:38:40 When it's when it's endless war related like when i'm doing when i'm drawing slime wards or or drawing like doing the cop killer
01:38:46 Top killers image. Yeah, I fucking make it and and he gets into it and you obviously fucking care
01:38:51 I spend so long. I spend like
01:38:54 A long time just fucking around with color filters. I don't know. There's something really compelling about it to me
01:38:59 This I should have just been a graphic designer because like fucking around like fucking around with images and like fucking around with color filters and stuff
01:39:05 is like
01:39:06 Really fun and gratifying
01:39:09 It's so like
01:39:11 Obviously the passion is there from both of us
01:39:14 And it's like you specifically like you love endless war so much and I sure do
01:39:21 Have you seen my walls? Yeah. Yeah, dude. Okay, right now. I'm looking at a flag of new los angeles city like the city fight
01:39:26 And I turn around and I see the giant cop killer flag and I look over the side see the
01:39:31 I gave it to you at rfckcon one like this in this war like city image that I made
01:39:35 And it's just like all around here is endless more stuff
01:39:38 It's just a matter of like
01:39:40 It doesn't benefit you in like a living way. You know
01:39:44 Like you need to live you've always been like a person living on like the fucking edge in a way margins of society. Yeah, like it's so like
01:39:53 We love it so much and yet it hurts so so it's it's it's
01:39:56 It's our prodigal son. But anyway, you gotta go. I gotta go. You gotta down the rest of that marshmallow rocks our ex-durance
01:40:04 Oh, you done I
01:40:09 All right, dude, well, I guess I'm gonna end the stream then okay
01:40:11 I'm ending the stream
01:40:13 I'm ending this dude. Look at look how slimy this is this is pretty slimy
01:40:15 This is this will either be like one big video or like several small ones. We'll see whatever see you soon. Fuck off
