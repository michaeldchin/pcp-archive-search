00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best guy ever.
00:00:09 I'm doing what I do here on the YouTube as you do. And we're joined today by the usual boys Ben Saint.
00:00:18 More content grist for the mill.
00:00:22 Indeed. Gibbontake. There he is.
00:00:24 I got a comic content that you read right now. The lord of ghosts chapter six is out.
00:00:32 Call me when it's been converted to anime. That is great though. I haven't read chapter six yet.
00:00:37 It's all great so far. And today we're joined by a guest friend of the show. We haven't seen it a
00:00:41 while, but welcome back everybody. He's been doing great lately. FitMC. What's going on? How are you
00:00:48 doing guys? There he is. The oldest Anarchy Minecraft server in the game. In the world.
00:00:57 All time man. Good to see you man. Really YouTube. I think the last time we spoke might have been
00:01:05 in the in the chat during Radcon 4 when I think you popped in for one of the live streams. But I
00:01:12 think yeah like the last time I was on the podcast wasn't it like three years ago already?
00:01:17 Something like that. I think so. That's crazy. At least a year ago. Have we even been a podcast
00:01:23 for three years? I think we're over three years now. I believe so. We did the math the other day.
00:01:28 It was end of 2015. I think is when we started because it was a little bit after I started
00:01:32 BG. Just bury me. Yeah. I agree. End of 2015 pretty sure. Maybe I'm wrong but I think that's right.
00:01:44 Well let's just say for the record. So Fit has recently hit the legendary one million subscriber
00:01:49 mark. It's pretty great. I'm amazed. You'll still waste your time with folks like us down in the
00:01:56 slums. You can't forget where you came from you know. I always had a great time hanging out with
00:02:00 you guys. He owes it all to the progressives podcast. We basically invented FitMC. We invented the
00:02:07 old standard server in Minecraft. Yeah. That's right. You know and believe it or not I always
00:02:13 thought like there's no way like once you reach a million there's no secret YouTube Illuminati.
00:02:18 There is. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Is that so? Yeah. And it's like you actually get to talk to actual
00:02:24 YouTube employees. It's crazy dude. Oh sure. You know I did discover after I hit 100,000. Now I
00:02:31 wasn't the first of our group to do so. Did you had long ago but did you just a bit of a fuck up
00:02:36 when it comes to I don't know like engaging with the platform and talking to I don't know like the
00:02:42 employees and whatnot to solve problems. But the second that I hit 100,000 I was like let's get this
00:02:47 plaque going boys. Let's get that silver shit in my room. So I just logged in to the like the contact
00:02:55 the YouTuber help or whatever immediately got like connection with a person and we like instantly
00:03:00 sorted out like how to get the things sent out what form I need to fill out something that Digi
00:03:05 said was like a real hassle and he struggled with and he couldn't figure out or that there was like
00:03:10 some issue in the way. My instinct is that while the tools were available he was simply not capitalizing
00:03:16 on them in the appropriate way. So this is another call out to you Digi. I think you still have not
00:03:21 gotten your silver play button which you were certainly deserved or owed or whatever. So my
00:03:26 experience was that as soon as you hit that the tools did in fact open up to a degree and I could
00:03:32 only imagine that at the million mark it opens up you know even more so. The Illuminati is deeper
00:03:37 and wider than we ever thought possible. That's right starting to get to the inner circle man
00:03:41 like it's crazy all these conspiracies it's wild. I could go on for hours but I don't want to bogart
00:03:47 the podcast so. Thank you. Appreciate it. Did you have you filed for your gold play button out of
00:03:54 curiosity? They haven't sent me the code yet because normally like after a few weeks they'll
00:03:59 give you a code which they send it to you in the mail but I haven't received it yet but I know
00:04:04 there's been an issue with like YouTube verification like normally you know when you hit a hundred
00:04:10 thousand subs normally you get that little check mark. Well apparently no one's been able to get
00:04:16 that for like the past I want to say six months. Like a really popular Minecraft YouTuber Dream
00:04:23 just hit two million subscribers and he still doesn't have his yet. So it's it's yeah I mean
00:04:30 there's a lot of really strange things happening at YouTube right now. Not everybody is a Digi Bro
00:04:35 and by which I mean un-incompetent. It is possible he hasn't talked to the folks that
00:04:42 created support but maybe he has and he would he would you know just clarify. Yeah I don't know.
00:04:45 You know Nate I got to say I watched your entire lecture on One Piece and it was
00:04:51 phenomenal. I mean now I talk to my friends and I act like I've seen One Piece. Right.
00:04:59 Right. You never actually have to do it. It's fantastic. Save you the trouble. Did you hear that
00:05:04 guys? Fit likes my content. Oh my god that reminds me of there's a reason I'm having audio glitches
00:05:08 today and it's because guys fits at something nice about me you know how that makes me feel
00:05:13 a little bit like this. Yes I'm doing it. Easy money.
00:05:20 I did it guys. I figured out how to pipe the fucking soundboard into my audacity and so that
00:05:27 everyone can hear it. Congrats. Oh it feels good. That's the real celebration. Thank you. Thank you.
00:05:32 I gotta get one of those. Let me give you one of these. Dude it's it's it's good. I got my Elgato
00:05:37 soundboard that I've been using for a year or two. I absolutely love it but just this very day
00:05:42 I have figured out how to get it for podcast so I can do things like this.
00:05:55 It brings me so much joy every single day of my life. Oh Ben Ben tell us one of your really
00:06:01 boring stories. Tell us a really uninteresting story of your life. I well I was playing Dungeons
00:06:09 and Dragons. I hate this already. I was a little frog and I I missed I missed the pond
00:06:16 and I went to a cave and I and I and I killed a goblin and I had some some bore
00:06:24 from a mine. Come on. I spent it on on the wizard to make water for me because I needed
00:06:32 to live and breathe. Dude make sure to stay hydrated. You know what I'm saying. Oh yeah guys
00:06:38 mage is back. She's such a normie. I do Ben. Thank you. Thank you. Did you get the water that you
00:06:43 see? You're welcome. I did. I was very happy. Give it up for Ben everybody. Give it up for Ben's
00:06:47 D&D story. Thank you. This can't be how it is from now on. This is how it is from now on.
00:06:55 This is the world. He lived in a post soundboard world.
00:06:58 Yeah well now what were we saying? Back to the praise of my lecture which was great. Thank you
00:07:08 very much. What else was I going to say about that? Oh I didn't just want to take the opportunity
00:07:14 while the lectures came up to again shame those people who have not released their lectures
00:07:19 specifically Munchy because this is the one that I want to watch again the most because it was so
00:07:24 good and you get so little Munchy content day to day. I can't believe it. What is he even doing
00:07:29 with it? I'm just sitting on it. Just sitting on it. He's just shameful. He's doing his school
00:07:35 work. He's doing his homework. He's doing his little you know what was his lecture on? My comic.
00:07:42 That's true and are you aware of this fit? Ben's been his ode art by some of our members and it's
00:07:48 truly shameful. I am all right. I realize everyone hates me. Everyone hates me now because my
00:07:54 comic's not out. My book's not out. The reason why is because I waited until the school year
00:08:00 started to get them the the shit and then they all had because they're all little babies. They're
00:08:05 all in school. They've all got homework to do. They've all got to be on Zoom or whatever and
00:08:10 talking to their professors. Some summer vacation babies. Summer vacation finally
00:08:17 six month overdue book can be made at last. I will no longer be a liar.
00:08:25 Oh yeah it's the end of May so that's going to be like any day now that summer vacation will be
00:08:29 upon us right? I mean it's practically already summer. I mean imagine you're a student in school
00:08:36 right now. Do you actually give a shit? Oh god. Absolutely not. It's got to be a true nightmare
00:08:44 and you have more, what's the word I'm looking for? More history with this than others. I was
00:08:50 watching your million subscribers special with great fascination fit where you talk about you
00:08:54 were an elementary school teacher when you got into Minecraft and you started playing it in
00:08:59 college and all that good stuff and you basically I just want to point out for those people who
00:09:05 don't necessarily think of this life path that you pursued a trait. You pursued a relatively
00:09:12 stable life path of being a teacher and whatnot doing something obviously you're interested in
00:09:16 and then you had a hobby that you loved and pursued independently and then once that
00:09:23 got to a point where it looked like that would be economically viable then you made a transition
00:09:28 and when you had already like developed your love for this your your skills in creating the medium of
00:09:33 YouTube content and whatnot and your your wit and witticism and also had developed the
00:09:40 bald head polishing technique that really gives your videos the edge that the kids crave and they
00:09:46 come running for. So just want to point out to everybody this is a very good life path to take
00:09:53 one that I would recommend to a lot of people and yes it is what I did so you can have a little bit
00:09:59 of bias in there but I think it's just a good idea. So looking back on it is there anything do you
00:10:04 feel any perhaps any any desire like looking back on as I compare myself to some of my contemporaries
00:10:09 online and whatnot that you should have like dived yourself in like as soon as possible sooner
00:10:16 and and weaned off of your job faster to get to a career that's been so great for you and so nice
00:10:22 and hopefully rewarding and all that. Any any wishes you've done sooner? Well for me I mean so
00:10:27 on June 1st that will be one year I've been YouTuber full-time and I would say the timing
00:10:34 worked out exactly the way it was supposed to because I had a very unusual rise to YouTube
00:10:40 fam I mean I went from zero subscribers to like 80,000 in like three months and that is right
00:10:46 not typical and it just I've been looking at your rise to a million was in the last couple months
00:10:52 from like 300,000 or something insane exponential growth. I know and it's just like with that first
00:10:58 initial explosive growth I didn't know how to maintain an audience so I needed to spend a few
00:11:06 years in algorithm hell to really learn how to be a YouTuber so I mean the timing it just kind of
00:11:13 worked out perfectly I would say you know. I'm still figuring it out myself I'll hopefully one of these
00:11:19 days it'll work out for me but you know interesting you say you'll be like one year officially being
00:11:24 a full-time Uber on June 1st my anniversary of being a YouTuber full-time will be on July 1st
00:11:30 exactly one month later isn't that isn't that fun that's awesome man yeah yeah hopefully I uh don't
00:11:37 die of starvation see how it goes the most important thing to to do in the YouTube I think is to
00:11:43 do it just my inner thoughts coming out
00:11:49 you know you you're a piece of work you are maybe I was just gonna rib you for not uploading videos
00:11:59 you're taking a real long time in that final fantasy lecture okay not like totally understandable
00:12:04 thing actual video right right oh where's the video I can't wait to hear your thoughts on this
00:12:12 Nate I cannot wait I won't spoil it for you if you haven't heard my rantings this far I'll keep it
00:12:19 completely out of this episode I'll let you I'll let you guess and then one day you can see when
00:12:24 the video does come out hopefully the world will uh you know just accept the argument for for the
00:12:29 points that are being presented there without bringing any too much baggage of things I've said
00:12:34 elsewhere um yeah yeah what do you feel fit have you played it any investment in the series
00:12:39 so well I watched since I don't own a playstation I watched a full playthrough of the remake
00:12:46 and I'm afraid to say my thoughts on it because I know it's just gonna piss you off man
00:12:53 uh okay yeah I'm saying I'm a fucking consumer I fucking loved it no more as a
00:13:01 fucking genius man you know I've got to say this uh the approach of just not playing this
00:13:08 movie game and just watching it on YouTube that's really the perfect experience that's the best way
00:13:12 to consume any video game I would say I mean I feel like I've played 2b2t more than anyone
00:13:18 because I just leave the videos on autoplay in the background and just impassively gaining the exp
00:13:23 of a real gamer uh so frankly I think I'm probably more of a Minecraft veteran than you could ever
00:13:28 hope to be because I have 10 screens going at once all the time and I'm absorbing the information
00:13:33 gameplay was a was a fun footnote in history it's time to just devote ourselves to movie games
00:13:39 and uh let's just cut out this wasteful middleman of actually playing video games
00:13:44 gaming via osmosis man that's right that's the future I I've been playing Minecraft recently
00:13:51 like uh I'm just some server and I've been I've been grinding away I've made like a castle on
00:13:57 the sea and I've been making a moat in the ocean uh of the sea like it goes this scene and then it
00:14:04 goes down as a moat of the right yeah it's very cool very epic but it's really time consuming
00:14:10 because I have to like put dirt under the water then fill it with sand and then delete the sand
00:14:15 and I'm just realizing that nobody comes to this part of the map nobody it's not a very populated
00:14:20 server I'm like why am I gaming right now what am I really getting out of this that's a great
00:14:27 question if I was watching somebody just like do a speed build of this it would be like how cool
00:14:33 but I'm doing it and I don't like that I have a I feel you very foggy memory last night of trying
00:14:41 to log into Pixelmon I I can't I couldn't do it yeah I couldn't type the password I couldn't
00:14:49 write my name like your Minecraft password yes my I I think the last thing I remember
00:14:55 before blacking out was just trying to fail to type my password into the into the Minecraft login
00:15:02 screen I couldn't manage it I wasn't up to the task no no there's a new version it said you
00:15:08 need 7.2.2 and I was like oh fuck and I struggled right right to obtain 7.2.2 didn't didn't manage
00:15:16 it couldn't do it it's pretty pretty simple gave up had you committed yourself to the drink
00:15:20 and now I'm hungover now my head hurts and so your soundboard is really doing me a lot of
00:15:27 favors today I'm really loving it yeah that feels good the point is I can't play Minecraft it's
00:15:37 impossible it's it's the hardest game ever made because logging in is just impossible
00:15:43 can't get over that initial the initial hurdle the skill floor is just too high
00:15:48 right right uh you know hey I have been playing just a just a little bit there there's exciting
00:15:55 news in the world of a little game known as good Minecraft aka Terraria which just said it's final
00:16:02 update yesterday time of this recording journey's end I played it for like an hour or two just to
00:16:07 get the usual building stuff done make a house for the guide and dig a little bit of a mine and
00:16:12 stuff get a couple iron me and munchie have to like I think we have to rebuild slime base
00:16:16 in the new in the new game or something I don't know I think we're gonna write it does the old
00:16:20 map not work I don't know he says there's been a lot of changes he said something about how we
00:16:24 would need to like redo I assume we're just gonna transport the old map and maybe something
00:16:29 changed about it I don't know I haven't seen the new updates is it uh is that the name of the world
00:16:34 slime base or just like no we built no no it's our we built a little a nice little slime cove
00:16:40 a nice little bubble in the ground it's full of is there a name for the server does have a specific
00:16:45 name I think it might just be called rfck rfck oldest anarchy server in terraria
00:16:54 endless war is the oldest anarchy server in discord in discord it is it is it's true uh we
00:17:01 that's true I would say and um we've said a bunch of times uh fit that like what what endless war
00:17:08 are you familiar you're familiar with endless war rfck all this shit okay it's a it's a it's a
00:17:15 disc well me and munchie and some other people made it it's a discord server but it's a game
00:17:20 it's like an rpg and it's and it's for cool kids who love slime and um it is what what it needs it
00:17:28 has lore it has like it has existed for like two years it has like a rich and storied history of
00:17:33 like legendary events committed absolutely true by the player base and what it needs is videos like
00:17:40 what you make uh about a 2b2t it needs that same kind of like like a narrative you know like like
00:17:47 take the events that happened construct them into a narrative make a video about it so anyone can
00:17:50 be like oh I get it oh so that's what happened oh so that's why you know this character that character
00:17:56 that user is like you know famous for whatever like that's that's what the meme is all about
00:18:01 that kind of lore at least from my opinion is kind of the main draw of rfck in general
00:18:06 that's the real uh attachment that I feel to it we of course I've enjoyed the game we made a um
00:18:10 there's there's another lecture I don't know if you've seen it uh there's another lecture on the
00:18:14 the lecture a playlist that is the me and munchie doing an rfck lore lecture and you know it brought
00:18:20 a big like influx of new players now who all threw money at the kickstarter and stuff it was great it
00:18:25 was great I was gonna say uh fit if you had to guess if you had to quantify any kind of
00:18:32 guess as to like how much the popularity of 2b2t you think has increased specifically due to you
00:18:37 know your work on youtube and whatnot I mean I know I first heard of it due to your videos
00:18:41 uh I would say I was probably probably the primary catalyst for new people coming in for a while but
00:18:47 now there's actually a russian invasion going on where a bunch of russian youtubers have like
00:18:54 been making videos and they're getting millions of views I used to be able to log into 2b2t at
00:18:59 five in the morning and get right in but now like at five am I have to fucking russians I gotta wait
00:19:06 like 20 minutes man it's bullshit it's it's we're gonna have another cold war dude and it's gonna
00:19:12 be a minecraft okay it's just that like clogged with traffic yeah and it's because that's when
00:19:19 they would all be logging in because that's their oh god you know fifth vodka shot of the daytime
00:19:24 yeah they're squatting at their uh dull laptops and just going crazy what are they what are they
00:19:31 doing like they just fucking around or yeah they're just walking around just fucking falling in the
00:19:35 holes it's those pissy russies oh man oh yeah russian a hole and watch them fall in that's
00:19:50 that's the way it goes tear down the minecraft wall but what I've been doing recently is I've
00:19:57 been trying to like sort of diversify my content a little bit and I've been just talking about
00:20:02 broader minecraft topics like I did a video about this server called the uncensored library
00:20:09 and it was a minecraft server for news articles from countries without freedom of press fascinating
00:20:16 it was really crazy shit yeah so like there's a lot of real there's like there's so many communities
00:20:22 in in minecraft because it's the best-selling video game of all time I mean you've got the pvp
00:20:28 community you've got the shrek erotic role play community you've got all these communities
00:20:34 and that's that's real by the way I wish I was down yeah I believe it it's ridiculous man I think
00:20:40 you'll find a few members in this very call thing every joke is now a double joke you just hit it
00:20:51 with one of these when you're done I will eat your ass this should not be as funny as it is
00:21:00 so much I know I love my son he's like a pig in shit yeah you're right okay you know you know
00:21:13 call the comedy police all right I'm ready cart me away I hate him I hate him
00:21:21 okay all right what are we talking about I don't remember something about minecraft
00:21:26 shrek erotic here's another minecraft thing my brother the the infamous coder of run away
00:21:33 from snakes the video game not the winner of the most recent pcp royal rumble which is the sound
00:21:40 samurai aka hgb guy yes younger brother right yeah my youngest brother um the chas has been
00:21:47 often on he's like he's he's a coder boy he likes doing coding and he's recently got into
00:21:53 really into a coding and minecraft server with unique things in it and it's he's looking to
00:22:00 to like spread it around um I just wanted to take a little minute to explain how cool this is because
00:22:08 it started out like this one mini game called a rabbit catching where there are multiple different
00:22:14 maps and you you go to this area you teleport to this map and you and whoever else is playing
00:22:21 has to try and find all the rabbits and click them or stand on them and you get points and it's a
00:22:26 fun little game like that and for as a reward you get like a bunches of blocks and you would go to
00:22:33 build this island and then build stuff and so it was like a different way to play minecraft rather
00:22:37 than doing survival stuff and over time he has built so many great mini games like like with really
00:22:45 rich um uh I don't know I can't think of the words it's like really deep um well there's this one
00:22:54 mini game which is a king of the hill tf2 like slime rfck endless war thing where you choose a
00:23:01 pink team or purple team and you kill each other and you collect slime in a in an arena
00:23:05 wait what where's this where's this it's a server that my brother's working on I can send you a link
00:23:12 us royalties yeah we own pink and purple no no no I told him it was okay so it's fine you
00:23:21 all right well you pay palmy you can pay the price yeah I'll pay you in slime um
00:23:28 but yeah there's that there's um this pirate world which is my favorite basically you get on
00:23:33 this little boat and you whack this bell that's on the boat and suddenly you are in control of
00:23:38 this player owned boat and you have like a golden rod that is a navigation rod you right click the
00:23:43 navigation rod and your boat teleports in that direction and essentially that means you have
00:23:48 a pirate ship and you can sail around and like occasionally there's like random treasure chests
00:23:53 appear like buried treasure and if you have a compass it'll point to the treasure you go collect
00:23:58 the treasure there'll be like blueprints sometimes in the treasure chest you could take the blueprints to
00:24:03 like the pirate island in the middle of the map and you can change that in for like making your
00:24:09 ship bigger and it's it's like it's like a real pirate game it's really cool I'm really proud of
00:24:16 work ethic how is this possible it through lots of lots of Minecraft coding and programming
00:24:24 and smarts and it's really cool and I he needs more people to play on it so that it feels like
00:24:31 it's you know worth his time because at the moment he's just got a few friends and me
00:24:36 so I'm just shouting that out that's a little bit like uh you know fit you probably haven't
00:24:40 heard about this but we in fact have our own PCP Minecraft server that we have a patron for
00:24:46 to sustain the livelihood of and we've got like two admins we just brought on to work on it regularly
00:24:52 and they're constantly expanding and making like more features and stuff we're having a
00:24:55 Pokemon tournament it's it's a Pixelmon server primarily right now on uh on the 20th that you
00:25:01 if you want to stop by you should you should come check it out it's going to be at like 3 p.m. we're
00:25:05 all just going to be fighting Pokemon boys in the server so I don't know they're the invitation
00:25:10 look version come hang out some time oh you know I should know that offhand I don't remember
00:25:16 generally newer ones though generally more recent ones I can get you that later though
00:25:21 that's all good yeah I definitely want to check it out yeah yeah sure sure we got a lot of dope
00:25:25 stuff and um one of the things that they're building there's a bunch of ideas for like
00:25:30 unique stuff that we plan to do in the server it's generally Pokemon themes since that's
00:25:36 overall the the point of the server in general that we're thinking of expanding but but one of
00:25:40 the things that our boy Marenpan uh one of our admins is working on is like hey you like the
00:25:44 one piece lecture right well Marenpan is working right now on a like large-scale recreation of
00:25:51 the grand line from one piece uh like converted to like a Pixelmon progression system where you go
00:25:58 from island to island yeah what the fuck on the the board it has it's surrounded by borders that
00:26:04 function like the calm belt that prevent you from entering any place except from the beginning
00:26:09 of this area and you start on like you know I don't know like the twin capes or whatever it is
00:26:14 fucking what was the first one um oh what's the big cactus whiskey peak I don't know whatever island
00:26:19 it is I think they're just using the ones they visit in one piece and you're gonna go and like
00:26:24 fight trainers there and in some way that's still being worked out progress from island to island
00:26:29 going through the red line or through the grand line until you get to the end where there will be
00:26:34 something and it's we're still working it out but I haven't even the theory is sound I haven't
00:26:39 even fought my way to the top of endless war yet neither have I that's how much baby I am I just
00:26:45 haven't spent the time grinding up a team or anything though I do have only I could just type
00:26:49 my password into the freaking login screen it would be all uphill from there uh so but anyway
00:26:57 that's just one of the things that we're working on just the other day and I think we're gonna use
00:27:01 this for the tournament our boys built um like a new stadium like a Japanese themed tournament
00:27:08 stadium where we're gonna have like most of the battling for the tournament or something I don't
00:27:12 know it's just a great time those guys are killing it uh patreon.com slash peace be minecraft only
00:27:18 five dollars a month come play with us oh and it's it's free oh okay it was free but when you hear
00:27:23 this episode it will no longer be open to the public for like that five day event or whatever
00:27:28 but there will be more of those coming there are there we're planning to do more like every month
00:27:32 or something just to give people a chance to play well my my brother's minecraft server linked
00:27:36 the thing there's that's the ip uh that's free forever just just play the game it's it's fun
00:27:41 just hop in that he's recently made a like uh survive like resident evil survival horror
00:27:48 like pvp thing where like a button what everyone goes into the spooky house and then everybody
00:27:55 gets like the blindness effect except for one person uh who gets like a pumpkin on their head
00:28:00 and a scythe and they have to kill everyone and he's invincible and it's like that's pretty good
00:28:06 it is pretty good uh so it's really cool do things like this it's it's i mean yeah it's it's
00:28:14 basically you know he's not using any pre-existing mods he's coding all of this himself he's having
00:28:20 ideas and he's just doing it and he's just like really into that and i'm like i want people to
00:28:24 play it so that all of this time is not wasted that is way cool and i love it i've been uh i was
00:28:32 going to say that uh like in my recent experiences exploring the depths of various games specifically
00:28:38 like final fantasy seven i talked about this on my stream the other day so hopefully uh i don't
00:28:42 know most people haven't heard it but uh like as i was digging into just a bunch of features about
00:28:47 the game uh i noticed one interesting feature when i first started up like the pc version of ff7
00:28:53 which was the easiest to to get my hands on um like i noticed first of all that the music was
00:28:59 like horribly wrong and then like what is going on here and you do a bunch of digging and it turns
00:29:03 out that like first of all ff7 was a buggy mess that has notoriously been very hard for like
00:29:09 sort enix to like make updated versions of just for like ports to other systems and stuff so like
00:29:14 there's actually an extensive history of like all the problems with uh like the re-releases and
00:29:19 whatnot the like probably the biggest one being that the soundtrack is different and weird and
00:29:24 sucks uh on like all versions except like the original version so of course what i do is i
00:29:30 turn to the heroes in the modding community to just save me from this awful music so boom use
00:29:36 a mod and get the correct soundtrack in there thank god thank god now it isn't terrible bullshit
00:29:41 anymore um but beyond that there was like the next issue that i've been like looking into
00:29:46 and i i'm definitely going to touch on this at least a little bit in my um my ff7 remake video
00:29:51 and stuff but but uh to say it in a little more detail here because i want to have an opportunity
00:29:56 in that context it's that in the remakes of ff7 or rather the like the remasters the re-releases
00:30:02 and stuff characters in the field model they're they're lego models they have visible mouths
00:30:09 and they did not in the original i saw i'm talking about did you link that the video that was like
00:30:14 comparing all the different versions or did i just find that somewhere that is a popular
00:30:19 video that's making the rounds yeah i saw a video it's like yeah comparing all the the
00:30:23 different re-releases like the pc version yeah yeah but it those mouths look so bad like it's
00:30:28 insane yeah that i the first version i played was the pc steam version i saw the mouse i was like
00:30:34 okay that like for at first i was like are they is that part of the thing but then i saw like
00:30:40 yeah it was just in a in scenes that were very inappropriate the way they look right i was like
00:30:46 okay it's a glitchy thing i'm playing a different version of the game so i sort of ignored it but
00:30:51 it was still kind of like that sucks oh my god if i had known that like when you play oh sorry
00:30:56 were you saying something yeah i was gonna say i can't i can't believe i haven't told you this
00:31:00 nate the first time i ever played final fantasy seven was when the drummer of the plain white
00:31:07 teas was babysitting me when i was a kid yeah okay so a long time ago my cousin dated the drummer
00:31:16 from the plain white teas because you know my cousin's a lot older than me um and they were
00:31:21 babysitting me one night and he's like hey well kid check out this game final fantasy seven for
00:31:26 the playstation i was like what the and like they didn't have a memory card so i could only play
00:31:31 through like the midgar section like and i loved it man but like that's one of those i mean it's
00:31:38 it's good shit man that's it's no no no argument here it's one of those stories where i tell people
00:31:42 they don't believe me that's you know it's just one of those weird stories that is a weird story
00:31:48 but hey uh sometimes weird stories are true oh man look at this oh and wilson looking motherfucker
00:31:56 they did hey there delilah yeah yeah they're the ones yep that's oh my god you're right
00:32:01 it is it delilah delilah baby look at this light look at this light yagami looking ass
00:32:07 look at this uh look at this uh two-faced guy who's the guy who played two-face uh
00:32:15 aron something you sure i love he looks like all those three people that i just mentioned
00:32:19 go watch thank you for smoking yes hey there delilah what's it like in 2b2t what's it like in
00:32:26 midgar i was playing ff7 with my new best friend the friend fit mc the oldest anarchy server in
00:32:33 minecraft beautiful beautiful thank you thank you um what was i saying about that oh right so if i
00:32:41 had known give at that time that like the version you were playing of ff7 like on the steam release
00:32:46 or whatever had like this glitch which i didn't know existed i would have screamed and cried like a
00:32:52 pussy baby about how no you need to play the real version you're playing this shit i i couldn't find
00:32:58 i couldn't find like i went to my local game store that still existed at the time um i mean
00:33:05 they still exist but they don't have like old games anymore um and i i found final fantasy seven
00:33:11 no final fantasy eight and nine i thought oh they're really cheap some reason i'll get those
00:33:16 uh but i couldn't find seven so it was like whatever steam's fine i wouldn't know i don't
00:33:22 blame you at all i'm playing the steam one right now look at these fucking crisp polygons why are
00:33:26 they so shit why did we ever move past crts i i feel you we don't need any more bits than 32
00:33:34 everyone beyond there's a waste and a dude is fascinating i had my mom send me the the
00:33:41 playstation one and like some of the games just to fuck around with and like the memory card is 32
00:33:48 bits meanwhile i just purchased for like to transfer files for my ps4 whatever i needed a
00:33:53 micro sd card like a i think it was like a 256 bit in you know a little micro sd and i'm like
00:34:00 micro xd over here bro this is like crazy the technology you know what i'm saying that's
00:34:06 incredible it really do be like that sometimes yeah but uh on this model thing i so i looked into it
00:34:14 and i was gonna play the steam version i still am playing it and stuff the the sound thing
00:34:19 intolerable oh you probably played with like the shitty soundtrack to give oh i'm crying i'm crying
00:34:24 inside uh i do vaguely recall like a weird sound thing and i think i may have got a mod to fix it
00:34:32 okay that would be like if it was like yeah if it if you had seen it heard it and it was like
00:34:39 painful i i feel like i did something about that well that's that's great i mean to be fair it's
00:34:46 not like it's literally like broken and fractured i mean i'm aware i've been listening to that soundtrack
00:34:51 for like decades and it's like my favorite when i was a kid i didn't listen to albums i listened to
00:34:56 the soundtrack of final fantasy games oh wait no a little bit stuck in my brain yeah i do remember
00:35:01 because i downloaded the soundtrack and it sounded the same as i remember it from the game so yeah
00:35:06 okay great that's that's fantastic oh my god um i just want to say yeah i'm so glad i'm not alone
00:35:13 i used to feel like am i the only one that listens to video game soundtracks like when i was growing
00:35:18 up and like i fucking loved them man i'm glad it's a very i used to burn final fantasy soundtracks
00:35:25 to cds to play in my walkman cd player so that i could have them on the go and listen to the main
00:35:32 theme of final fantasy 7 whenever i damn well pleased and uh it was great i i had my mp3 player
00:35:39 which i still own and it's filled with like the entire okami soundtrack and things like that
00:35:45 fucking let me just like this is you i wish that were me
00:35:54 man all this remake talk i played through the original like all the way once i got a little
00:35:59 older like i was in high school and i just hope they keep sid smoking in the remake
00:36:06 oh that's one of the things that's one of the things that i fear fucking dynamite with his
00:36:11 cigarette for his limit sure does buddy he sure does i mean wait it's not a game for babies they
00:36:17 wouldn't take the cigarette out well i i certainly hope not but if they do i will scream and cry
00:36:23 like a little baby i would be which i am i will wet my diaper the game has guns in it it has guns
00:36:29 so it has to have cigarettes as well imagine if they had the guns with the orange plastic tips on
00:36:35 the end you know i noticed that'd be simply epic dude i mean for example i believe heitiger
00:36:42 but definitely president shinra has a big honkin cigar but he's evil so it's like oh yeah that's
00:36:49 okay the heroes can't smoke because winners don't do drugs forgets that absolutely right but hey
00:36:55 forget um the smoke and the cigarette will sid still be a literal wife beater or a girlfriend
00:37:02 beater because if they don't keep that i mean i'm just gonna say this is no longer our god this
00:37:07 is not the man like his assistant she's girlfriend too and there's there's a specific line in the
00:37:13 original where uh they say because it's okay to be your assistant it's not going to be a girlfriend
00:37:19 if you start dating or you have to stop beating her it's great there's a line at the end or in
00:37:24 what when you first meet number seven where i think tifa says like oh it's weird that you treat your
00:37:27 wife like that he's like oh god my fucking wife don't i'm gonna fucking puke i would never marry
00:37:33 you like a disgusting fucking piece of shit like her man so based so that sounds more
00:37:40 sincerity than than sincere no no he really hated it's not like i hit you because i don't
00:37:47 like you or anything he hit her because he really hated her and resented her on a deep level
00:37:54 amazing which is somewhat understandable heart or a hot take shara was 100 in the wrong she
00:38:01 should have known she was trying to saddle sid with the baggage of having murdered his assistant
00:38:06 to go to space no that's not that wouldn't maybe i'm remembering incorrectly didn't she find out
00:38:13 like the ship was gonna blow up if it took off and so she was trying to like save sid and that's
00:38:18 kind of his whole character arc you're absolutely right it's just in the the full series of events
00:38:24 is like yes sid was downplaying like some issue that could and probably would have like killed him
00:38:31 when trying to launch the rocket it would have been like some coolant was leaking it was like a
00:38:35 serious problem some of that star trek techno babble technical issue okay sure fine true
00:38:40 and shira was like i need to fix this because i want the launch to go off without a hitch
00:38:45 but her quote unquote solution was to put herself like in the cargo bay or whatever to be fixing
00:38:50 the problem which was going to be like flooded with radiation or space rays or something and
00:38:56 she was going to die in there and when sid says oh hey i'm about to take off you're gonna die if
00:39:02 you're in that room shira says just do it like that's fine i will die and i'm just saying
00:39:08 she should have known that no person is just gonna say sure yes i will just kill you shouldn't
00:39:15 achieve my dream she have just like not been in there i don't you know what i'm think the more
00:39:21 i'm thinking about the less sense this makes why didn't she fix it it's a very anime situation
00:39:26 why didn't they just put the launch off why didn't they launch like the next day that's exactly
00:39:33 i think the general idea was like shinra was getting frustrated the project was going to get
00:39:38 canceled soon if they didn't have results and also like sid was not listening to shira he was
00:39:44 like blowing her off and dismissing her as you know because he's the captain blah blah blah i
00:39:48 want to go do the space stuff and i don't want to delay this anymore because there's financial
00:39:52 issues she was backing us etc etc uh so like they concocted the situation it was rough sounds like
00:40:01 maybe final fantasy seven bad game oh yeah hard to agree gotta agree hate to say it i feel like
00:40:08 you'll have an easier time getting cigarettes in final fantasy because it's a video game it's not
00:40:12 like a movie like dude do you know how strict they are with movies like if you put a cigarette in a
00:40:18 movie yeah automatic r rating automatic really yeah that can't be true so if you have ever seen that
00:40:24 movie about walt disney you see him a tom hanks yeah you see him put out something and they don't
00:40:32 show what it is but it's a cigarette because disney was a huge smoker but they can't show disney
00:40:37 smoking or else the family friendly film gets an r rating so they had to be super clever about how
00:40:43 they did it Jesus fascinating she you know you can see the logic behind it but does seem a little
00:40:49 bit to seem a little bit silly yeah um anyway to make my final point here about this i was looking
00:40:56 into this mod situation uh to like fix the music and then when i noticed in the pc version the first
00:41:01 thing i saw was like oh my god big's his mouth and wedge and jesse are like horrible barrett and
00:41:06 cloud look fine or whatever um but then i i was like looking online or i remember that video that
00:41:11 puts the details together or something where uh you see that sephiroth's mouth is just like a
00:41:16 gape like jesse big's and wedge i can somewhat understand but sephiroth is like the most important
00:41:23 character outside of like literally cloud or maybe your main cast or something so they really should
00:41:29 have fixed that luckily for me there were two mods available online that people had made to fix this
00:41:34 issue one simply disabled all mouths to make it like the original and that's that's okay that's
00:41:40 acceptable you can see that one working but i did find that like because now everything is so much
00:41:45 more high resolution it kind of feels a little bit weirder so instead i found another mod that just
00:41:51 adds like better looking mouths to all the models to make them look better so like sephiroth no
00:41:57 longer has his horrible gaping o mouth or whatever and it's funny to think that like i don't know i
00:42:03 kind of feel like the mods solution in this particular instance is the most appropriate one
00:42:09 in keeping with like the spirit of the original it's like uh i don't know i don't know since like
00:42:15 fidelity has increased just due to time marching onward and everything looks so much more polished
00:42:20 it's almost kind of weird now to not have mouths but so you have to turn to the modding community
00:42:25 for the solution to this particular issue um and i don't know maybe this is obvious to people
00:42:29 who are experienced modders i haven't really done too much of it messed around with like securo and
00:42:35 oh i just installed uh the the cinders mod for dark souls 3 that my boy uh limit breakers just
00:42:42 advertised in one of his big old beautiful videos that you guys should all watch if you at all give
00:42:46 a shit about dark souls content or just you know good videos which he always makes uh yeah anyway
00:42:54 they made like his videos are too good they are too good they definitely are too good and i don't
00:43:02 know how or why he is one able to make them that good and two finds the will to put in the kind
00:43:08 of effort to make them as amazingly good as they are because the the full hit i would love to get a
00:43:15 behind the scenes scoop on like how he makes his videos because it must involve a complicated series
00:43:20 of like installing the mods he needs to make the particular like camera work and stuff happen like
00:43:26 in some way either green screening or like magically cropping to like an amazingly competent
00:43:33 degree the models out of like things to do is like super imposing animations and attacks and
00:43:38 stuff for like his various pans and fades and combining different footage of different stuff
00:43:44 i don't know he's one of the most amazing editors uh in the game in my mind and i love his style
00:43:50 so uh let's let's be best friends limit breakers i think you're the coolest guy
00:43:53 and his whole channel is final fantasy seven themed so he's a he's a good guy uh in my book
00:44:01 anyway mods are cool love to love to sip and uh you're welcome for fixing your shitty work
00:44:08 square enix i have found solutions that the community has found to uh improve your bad work
00:44:14 oh you know what last interesting thing i found on that was just that i was i was looking around
00:44:18 at different versions i noticed that uh the switch version which is like the most recent
00:44:23 port that exists anywhere i think their solution to this horrible mouth problem was like okay some
00:44:29 mouths work like cloud and tifa and barrett they look perfectly fine most of the time but like
00:44:33 sephiroth has the big o and the pc so what do we do they simply keep mouths for some characters
00:44:38 like cloud and tifa etc and they just like turn them off for other characters so now it's like a
00:44:44 new thing where just some characters have mouths and others don't have broken mouths they just
00:44:49 have no mouths and that's weird and doesn't seem quite right anyway anyway mods are great
00:44:56 they're uh the heroes we need in this world to save us from this hellscape of imperfect mod work
00:45:02 or imperfect developer remasters and whatnot so thank you boys and girls out there for all your
00:45:07 hard work i love mods right okay so this week i made gummy worms oh i saw my sweet
00:45:19 i missed it i have to go look it's so no listen i spent i said this on twitter i spent like
00:45:25 hundreds of dollars buying weird shit um right the key the key to the perfect gummy worm the
00:45:31 perfect keto gummy worm is iso malta oligosaccharides aka soluble soluble tapioca starch um it is a
00:45:42 miracle ingredient but they they they're out i bought one jug of it and i made the perfect
00:45:48 gummy worm i perfected the formula and i said i'm gonna do this for the rest of my life and then
00:45:52 i went back and the manufacturer's like now we're out now we don't make it anymore now that's there
00:45:57 it's gone i don't know i don't know i need it back i need it back listen listen i i was in
00:46:04 i was i've been like a mad scientist that all my all my roommates keep seeing me like making weird
00:46:09 goop in the kitchen making just cooking up some gels and jellies and slime and and and but you
00:46:17 know what they they can't argue with the results they can't argue the fact that this is not some
00:46:24 jello horseshit this is not some bullshit this is like this is this is candy like you'd buy in a
00:46:28 plastic bag on your corner store i even got i've even got the crystals i've even got the stuff
00:46:34 you know like you know you eat like a sour gummy and it's got the christly stuff yeah i've got that
00:46:39 i've got that stuff i made those you know what it is it's pure it's pure malic acid pure i have
00:46:46 big bags of pure crystallized acid that i eat now you can just eat it raw you can see the spoonful
00:46:51 of it if you want is it good to enjoy it well i wouldn't enjoy that much but you can you can
00:46:56 just tap tap your finger on it you just coat your finger on it and lick it off your finger
00:46:59 and it's actually kind of nice it tastes i mean it's it's very sour but it's very pleasant it's a
00:47:05 nice look at your work here it looks good did you get worm molds to do this specifically so many
00:47:10 i made like hundreds of them and i ate all of them and these were the last three that i had
00:47:15 to take a picture i was like i have to save these to take a picture with yes that was wise that's
00:47:20 wisely done but you've got the recipe now you have the secrets i've got the recipe but there's like a
00:47:25 there's like an x factor there's an x factor and that is xanthan gum because when i add xanthan gum
00:47:31 strange and mysterious things happen sometimes it like doesn't change the outcome at all other
00:47:36 times the same amount will make it like super thick like taffy like there was one time when i
00:47:41 couldn't even pour it into the molds because it was just too sticky i just had to like take a big
00:47:45 glob of it and glob it onto the mold and just kind of rest it on top of the mold and some of it sort
00:47:51 of went into the molds and then i had to just peel the entire lump off and sort of cut the worms
00:47:55 out of it right it was so rubbery but it was delicious it was just a taffy mass and i think
00:48:02 maybe because i i let someone else whisk at that time who's stronger than me because i'm a weak boy
00:48:07 i think maybe he just whisked it really hard and it stretched it like taffy in it and it gave it
00:48:10 that consistency um interesting anyway this has been this has been what i've been doing this week
00:48:16 this has been my project i succeeded um you know i am a miracle worker um yeah um every each
00:48:25 shit everyone fuck you you'll never make a gummy worm like me fascinating you you know you got me
00:48:30 beat you got me beat uh i don't know i am impressed and i see that you say here that you've invested
00:48:36 hundreds of dollars yes on all your your tinctures yes i the the commitment the oh the isomalta
00:48:42 oligosaccharides are pretty expensive maybe yeah how how are you supposed to mass produce these for
00:48:49 so cheap um i guess is it really just like a quantity makes it worth it um possibly well i mean
00:48:56 this is like because it because if i were just doing like regular gummies with sugar it's like
00:49:01 sugar and gelatin like non keto they would be much cheaper of course right right like these
00:49:07 i've been i was i was going broke bankrupting myself buying this brand at Whole Foods called
00:49:12 smart sweets and i was like i can't i can't spend four dollars a bag on these i'll be dead i will
00:49:17 die so i have to spend hundreds of dollars instead um um but i just looked at the ingredient list
00:49:25 and i was like hmm a lot of weird shit i don't understand on here let me just so i went on amazon
00:49:30 and on like net nettrition.com where you can buy just bulk food chemicals and i bought bags of shit
00:49:36 they ran out after after a while there i i don't know what i don't where did it go
00:49:41 how do they why do they not sell it anymore and it's not just them like every distributor i was
00:49:45 fine that sold from this i think this brand this uh uh uh fiber yum is what the brand is called i
00:49:51 think they just like died or like like stopped existing or decided like this this product
00:49:56 wasn't profitable anymore because that is the only kind is the only brand of it that i can
00:50:00 find anywhere and it disappeared and was made unavailable on every like retailer
00:50:06 shit man i don't know maybe it's these maybe it's these tough economic times i might be able to get
00:50:12 a powdered kind we will we will god bless we will god speed yes uh this has been ben's gummy time uh
00:50:19 please thank you thank you yeah i'm honored
00:50:28 oh that feels good one day also ben to his gummy worms i will eat your ass
00:50:35 i will um i will i i i will let you taste them one day one day oh yeah yeah i would love to i would
00:50:42 love to this is gonna be my thing whenever i have guests over i'm gonna be like all right welcome to
00:50:46 my house here's gummy worms i made them myself yeah i was gonna say here's happy have these gummy
00:50:52 worms and then then you eat them and it's like ha ha your keto now long got them i was gonna say
00:50:58 that uh there's probably some potential to like uh like selling these you know since you have such
00:51:04 labors to make them i want but it is food so maybe that's like i think i might i think i might like
00:51:10 get like custom molds made and make like rfck gummies you could definitely do it i could make
00:51:17 like slime corp gummies i could make uh you know i could just make slime i could just make a big
00:51:21 bag of like could make podrans i don't know make i would make them real sour make them real sour
00:51:27 green that's all super cool i love it i think it'd be pretty i think that'd be pretty fun and you
00:51:32 know now that you've devised the alchemical circle necessary to summon them from hell
00:51:38 it's the possibilities are endless it would probably much like the war selling them such a
00:51:43 thing would probably be really hard i would probably have to get like licenses i'd probably
00:51:48 have to get like my kitchen surveyed by the fda which like it certainly wouldn't pass because
00:51:53 it's filthy um right but you know whatever perfect environment for worms to grow filthy delicious
00:52:00 delicious well that's it that's my gummy story i will eat your ass your wealth your wealth good
00:52:09 i look forward to trying some one day when i'm in the neighborhood
00:52:14 yeah or maybe you can sell them at the next radcon i will give them away for free much like our
00:52:20 uh put them in um the piece of cany's could we could we get away with making them like backer
00:52:24 rewards you know food seems like i mean i think you the only way to do it would probably be to
00:52:32 give them away for free because i think if you charge them you open yourself up to like some
00:52:36 kind of i wonder if like um if like Kickstarter would be like please don't make your backer
00:52:43 rewards like food like please don't send food in the mail yeah we will be i mean if i can uh what
00:52:49 was it the the drill andrew hussey kasey something kasey yeah those guys a collaboration like sweet
00:52:59 bro and hella jeff the book came with a backer reward which is you get hot sauce it you get a
00:53:06 bottle of hot sauce i didn't get that one because i didn't want a hot sauce i thought maybe that would
00:53:10 be sketchy but yeah apparently people had it wasn't bad they said it was food was it did it i'll
00:53:19 believe it did they just bottle it themself did it come with like a nutrition information and like
00:53:23 like you know labeled for retail sale and whatever i i don't know i think it may have been just a
00:53:28 funny meme bottle with like lol it's it's food it's sauce let me let me look this up
00:53:38 well that is dope because we've talked about the possibility we've talked about me and once
00:53:42 you talked about making fuck energy uh yeah but like and i looked a little bit into like how you
00:53:48 would do it like you there are machines that you use to do like the canning they're very expensive
00:53:53 obviously and like i i assume they would i can't when i when i consider when i consider what it
00:54:02 must take to like get your shit approved and like get them onto like store shelves um it sounds it's
00:54:08 it's you know it's probably probably take years i wouldn't be surprised if it would take years
00:54:13 all right here's the bottle um i think this is the entire label this is for the high rollers
00:54:18 out there exclusive premium gourmet barbecue sauce sweet brown and hella juicy yeah dinner
00:54:27 flavored sauce dinner flavored sauce looks normal it looks normal ingredients it is 100
00:54:35 sauce i would use that i would definitely use that uh maybe maybe because it's not
00:54:44 considered like intended that you probably put a thing like not intended to be consumed like not
00:54:49 a nutritional supplement or you know some shit like that i don't know maybe maybe something like
00:54:54 that would get you past the guards either way this sounds awesome and i want them all uh in my
00:55:02 mouth and stomach it sounds like i should have i should have backed i should have backed the
00:55:05 friggin book i didn't have any money at the time yeah i still want it i've got my my fidget spinner
00:55:13 from it hey oh you did it bozinga fuck yeah dude bruh bruh based based based
00:55:24 bruh bruh yes all good things
00:55:30 you know what uh you know what radcon needs though guys what's that you know how when i was popping
00:55:35 in the live stream i was like we need a royal rumble i wasn't talking about your normal royal
00:55:40 rumble we need an actual fucking royal rumble at radcon with a wrestling ring i want munchie to put
00:55:49 me through a table like let's let's make it happen we've got boys with some wrestling experience
00:55:58 but with that i mean jesse that time he jumped on a table and broke it wait was that video was that
00:56:03 in um plebe and the weeb yeah did that did that right yeah that's the radcon to plebe and weeb
00:56:11 stuff i think that was the last episode when they the last episode where they trashed everything
00:56:15 and it was very confusing was this did this i'm and you were there i wasn't there i think somebody
00:56:22 broke a sword who broke the sword i don't know it's been a while i always forget like which of the
00:56:28 plebe and the weeb content got released and like i feel like some of it like never got out or like
00:56:32 was still like premium content or something there i mean i think it was all released okay i think
00:56:38 you're you might be thinking of like the whole blu-ray debacle about how they oh and there was a
00:56:43 second season promised that was not filmed or like i think they tried and it got like the
00:56:48 footage didn't work or something there were issues right so um one day one day hopefully uh we'll see
00:56:54 that happen uh don't hold your breath boys and girls um i do remember jesse going through the
00:57:01 table i he did it like twice right because he's like oh the first one wasn't good i have to jump
00:57:05 through the table again it looked like it really hurt he seemed to be in like very brave way afterwards
00:57:12 yeah you got to like dead in your nerves to be able to endure uh such such blows
00:57:17 listen i am weak if we do a live royal rumble we so we have to build we have to build a platform
00:57:25 i will get in there i will cower i will go down in one punch i will i will crack fall uh i will
00:57:32 you know sure but i'll but i'll be but i'll make it funny like i'll just i'll make i'll be like a
00:57:36 joke character i feel like the joke wrestler who goes in there just i don't know whether you're
00:57:40 aware but um germa who was the original royal rumble with stupid characters guy the already has
00:57:49 done a live action royal rumble where he and a bunch of people act out uh him and and you know all
00:57:56 of his stupid characters beating the shit out of each other on a real wrestling ring and it was
00:58:00 really funny but obviously extremely difficult and expensive to to make let me see what kind of
00:58:06 venue they're in here it's it's technically doable i mean we'd need a lot okay they got a whole
00:58:10 facility yeah yeah i mean a whole bunch of people to do it this is the sort of thing that we could
00:58:17 make a stretch goal on a kickstarter for rad gun five or something but it would be like
00:58:21 in of itself this would be like i don't know like a five ten k kind of price point to rent out a venue
00:58:27 get all the costumes get like the production stuff up i don't know big productions doable
00:58:32 i do let's let's just tone it down let's just do a street yeah right well we'll buy some knives
00:58:39 we'll kill each other now that that's something i'm down for uh i would love to do that uh there's
00:58:44 only six of us though so maybe we could maybe we need guests to come in we gotta get uh fit
00:58:49 flying out there we gotta we gotta get all all of the all of the guests and all of the voice
00:58:54 grail voice jail people oh for the villains and heroes yeah that's a great idea let's get
00:59:01 fuck die buster in there so i can fucking kill die buster fuck die buster that sounds great
00:59:09 oh you know uh speaking of physical activity and whatnot you know fit i you maybe you didn't
00:59:16 see this but i when i was in hawaii most recently visiting my girlfriend's parents i finally did
00:59:21 the thing i've been wanting to do which is go surfing i did it in real life and was super fun
00:59:27 and i absolutely loved it and every day more than missing the ocean i miss specifically being able
00:59:33 to surf which i now want to make my life's purpose uh because it is a better way to be alive than
00:59:39 being a piece of shit landlubber or any of that stupid shit yeah man first of all i'm curious
00:59:45 as a as a floridian do you spend much time in the ocean around the ocean on the beach
00:59:50 or do you find yourself you know mostly just doing land type activities um well i'm kind of biased
00:59:56 because i live on an island you do oh shit that's right that's right i'm i'm one block away from the
01:00:04 beach usually yeah when there's not a worldwide pandemic i'm there like right four times a week
01:00:10 and something because i'm on the golf side the surf it only like happens we only get like good
01:00:16 surf waves like twice a month so like i always am watching the beach cam and if i see some good waves
01:00:22 i drop what i'm doing and i head out there like instantly oh that's the surfing lifestyle man
01:00:27 it's a better lifestyle one i want to be a part of uh unironically uh i don't know i i talked about
01:00:35 this like months ago when i when i did this but like i like i've been skateboarding for last like
01:00:40 i don't know year or two or whatever and those skills applied perfectly to surfing basically
01:00:45 same same kind of shit and uh it really just feels better than just not doing that to be doing it
01:00:54 and like feel the momentum i don't know i feel like you're tapping into like a primal
01:00:58 aspect of like a human psyche that just loves to move fast and do cool shit yeah and it's i think
01:01:06 a big part of it is that it's mother nature that's getting you to go this fast it's a force that you
01:01:12 cannot control you can only go with it you know it's exactly true it's it's sort of like a feeling
01:01:20 of sliding down a hill really fast on a toboggan or something yeah it is like that true and i only
01:01:28 went the one time but i did manage to catch some waves on my first outing surfing then and it was
01:01:35 awesome and you know it actually reminded me of as you said like it's a natural force that's doing
01:01:41 this shit um yeah i felt like it reminded me of the time when in my last apartment here in
01:01:46 Cincinnati when the street was just flooding and i was completely powerless if the rain just kept
01:01:53 coming it would have submerged my apartment and the basement was already flooded and there was
01:01:58 a car down the street that was 100% immersed underwater and that car is definitely in the
01:02:04 trash right now and i would just i in that case i was terrified and felt helpless and like i was
01:02:11 going to die uh but when you're surfing it's like you feel i don't know like uh like you're using
01:02:19 this force for good it's like weaponizing the thickness of the wave for the forces of good or
01:02:25 something like that right right and uh i don't know the other thing is i've never seen a surfer
01:02:34 who isn't hot so i think that's just another real benefit you will be a hot person if you surf
01:02:40 regularly and also you know i'm thinking of moving to virginia pretty soon and they you know they got
01:02:46 they got summers they got waves virginia beach is right in the ocean so like i could potentially
01:02:50 go surfing in the summer or whatever but you can't surf that's one part of the year i don't know
01:02:55 i don't you can't do it it's impossible there are no waves there is a surfing ability in virginia
01:03:00 beach i looked into it a little bit but as you said like like fit over here is talking about like
01:03:05 once or twice a month the potential is there to go surfing this is like there's a block of time during
01:03:12 the year like one month or two months out of the year where potentially that might be the case
01:03:16 that there's like decent waves sometimes the month but that is just a very limited time
01:03:22 and you can hardly define your life around that sort of shit or live the sexy surfing lifestyle
01:03:29 of exactly as you said dropping whatever you're doing and going to surf which you know in hawaii
01:03:34 is like massive culture out there and i want to be a part of that it seems like a good way to live
01:03:41 i want to do something that's more interesting than just going to the gym and lifting weights
01:03:46 because that's on the schedule i want to actually kind of be excited to go do so because jesus christ
01:03:52 the workout i got i surfed for like three or four hours or something and it was like probably the
01:03:58 most intense workout i've gotten of like my upper body just paddling out and out and out
01:04:04 and killing my arms hurt so fucking bad the next day uh point is this is a great workout great
01:04:10 exercise and you just are a cool person uh when you do it so it's all benefit and uh i want i want
01:04:16 to do it more that's that's the point of what i'm saying right now good man good man yeah it's good
01:04:22 for the body it's good for the soul yep yep never we've never done it i'll become a master ben
01:04:30 and then you can double board with me we'll go out there t-bap lives again rides again rides again
01:04:37 on the waves sounds fun sounds fun um all right well that's that's all the shit i had to say
01:04:49 you guys got more you want to talk about or we certainly can go to voicemails if you want to
01:04:53 i'm ready for voicemails yeah i'm down for whatever i got a bunch of them so we can we can
01:04:58 spend our our sweet time on that all right fuck it yeah let's do it oh wait wait uh uh ben before
01:05:04 i press play on any of that uh i wanted to let you know that i did some animal crossing stuff
01:05:12 and i want to see what's going on with your life with animal crossing stuff i was and to that to
01:05:17 that end let me okay ellie's are literally cut this because i have to find i have to find this
01:05:23 thing he said uh don't cut this ellie's are no cut it please this is good this is cut me
01:05:28 double it i like man here we go double it just play this twice please play this twice please put
01:05:33 on the reverb quick nick hit the sound board about the animal crossing but first oh yeah
01:05:38 yeah all right now it's content all right there you go take it away this is the ben
01:05:43 st jingle talk about a c n h go there it is
01:06:01 yeah
01:06:13 how can you see
01:06:25 yeah
01:06:31 well i i mean i guess i could probably take a picture but i have like so many black roses now
01:06:38 i have excellent infinite of them i gave them i was playing with a
01:06:43 kazzie yesterday and i gave i put a bunch of pink and blacks on her island because she wanted them
01:06:48 i have i have them to spare now i'm i'm excellent i don't even want my pinks i have them by accident
01:06:55 i do need i have a bunch of purples but it's not enough it's not even close um yeah uh uh
01:07:03 oh man i went to another island i went to a separate island from one of
01:07:07 kazzie's friends and i saw what a five star island looks like and i realized what does it
01:07:12 look like amazing and like imagine like everything like the entire island like cobblestone with like
01:07:18 little like parks and like pathways and little like gardens like just immaculate um i did hit
01:07:26 three stars the other day so i did unlock the thing so i've been making paths and feel much
01:07:31 better about my life and it really goes a long way so that's an improvement i gotta move some
01:07:36 shit around you know i feel like i've been unambitious um you know lots of flowers is
01:07:42 fine but like you gotta you gotta arrange them you gotta put them in just the right place for
01:07:47 them to really be worth anything um you know uh it's sunday morning the day we record this
01:07:54 i was awake and i totally forgot but i happened to be wandering around doing my daily rounds
01:07:59 i found that little stock motherfucker yes a little piggy-wiggy yeah and i bought 200 000 uh
01:08:07 dollars worth of turnips for there were 92 bells each that's pretty i feel will give a great return
01:08:15 on investment i i forgot this week last week i bought 500k worth and i had a spike i it wasn't
01:08:23 as big as the last time i i was on like the last time i sold at like 400 it was amazing
01:08:28 this time i sold it like at like 200 something so it was still pretty good so what what should i
01:08:33 aim for if i see like a 200 or a 300 one day i mean to jump on that well yes but there's
01:08:42 okay should i just give like the full explanation of how it works right now yes the yeah all right
01:08:49 here's here's everything everything you need to know everything you need to know about uh uh
01:08:53 turnips and the stock market um you will like you know you buy them at whatever price it's
01:08:58 usually around 100 and then in on any given week there will be one of four patterns that occurs
01:09:04 it will either be random or it will be um a just a steady decline or it will be a small spike or
01:09:12 a large spike and there's a there's a website called turnip profit as in p-r-o-p-h-e-t you can
01:09:18 type you if you're checking your numbers consistently you can put in like what are they
01:09:23 throughout the week you need to check twice a day and if you do that this algorithm will predict it
01:09:28 will like read it and be like okay this is the pattern you're on and it will predict like what
01:09:33 your turnip prices are likely to be and if you're on a spike week it will tell you okay it will peak
01:09:39 here like here's when it will peak this is when you should sell because like the the the the the
01:09:45 small spike is like four rising prices that go up to like somewhere around 200 and then they drop
01:09:51 off the large spike is two rising prices and then the third one is like a big spike and then after
01:09:56 that it goes down so sometimes you might see a good price like if you're on us if you're on like a
01:10:02 if you're on like a large spike the price might go up and it might be kind of good
01:10:06 but then if that third spike is about to happen it will like skyrocket so like if it's more it's
01:10:12 if you want to really maximize it it's not about just like sell at this point you got to like
01:10:17 know what trajectory you're on and know like how yeah just just use turnip profit it'll it'll
01:10:23 it'll pretty much predicted for you most of this is my first week doing it i want that money back
01:10:28 i want to return on investment so i'm gonna do that i'm gonna track it get on turnip profit
01:10:33 commit to checking prices twice a day put in the numbers it will predict you you'll see it you'll
01:10:39 see it the first question it has here is is this your first time buying and the answer is yes this
01:10:44 is my first time i think on the first time you buy it's guaranteed to be a certain pattern i don't
01:10:50 know which one but i think that's it because otherwise there's like a probability of which
01:10:54 pattern it's going to be and it's affected by like what did you have last week because like it's
01:10:58 unlike you're less likely to get the same pattern twice in a row okay okay um we'll see so that's
01:11:05 that's my primer on that the long story short just use turnip profit
01:11:10 i definitely will uh for this time see how it goes all right well good uh that's settled hopefully
01:11:16 you will be a smart investor ladies and gentlemen out there in youtube land uh but let's go on to the
01:11:21 rest of our voicemails speak pipe link down below and uh let's see what the people have to say
01:11:28 we've got like 10 or 11 or something today we'll just motor on through them as fast as we please
01:11:32 god uh they were they were quality uh in general i can't speak for them uh you know one was just
01:11:39 saying like yay fit is on happy happy joy and i was like that's good but i get the idea and i
01:11:45 don't need to play this whole thing uh so the rest are all very critical of fit the rest are very
01:11:51 negative very nice very nice um uh they're like no i'm the oldest anarchy server in minecraft
01:11:59 it's me sir you're stealing my my crown all right all right let's hear this first one this is simply
01:12:05 from why why why are the ads for mobile games so bad like it's clearly not even the game that
01:12:20 they're advertising i don't understand what the fuck was that okay i know what he's talking about
01:12:30 any all i can say the mafia city ads are fucking kino have you have you actually like
01:12:38 watched the montages they're incredible man i'm all about that afk arena no that is good share
01:12:47 i'm getting a lot of ads for afk arena uh i mean they are because mobile games are bad
01:12:54 across the board none of them are good we all know that when you say it's a good mobile game
01:13:00 you're talking about in the context of mobile games which are all bad like when i did my ad for
01:13:06 that game whatever it was that i played the other day for whatever we agile episode that was that
01:13:11 game was fine uh i can't even remember it was it was fine it was just a spin-off of concolay or like
01:13:19 you know kmart brand concolay and it's fine you can play it there are cute anime girls in it that
01:13:25 cannot be denied can you guys hear the kids screaming out my window but a little bit yeah i've been
01:13:30 hearing that very now okay okay good leave it in lezard he he's probably screaming because he just
01:13:35 got sniped in mafias city and he's just having a real tough time with that oh my god playing his
01:13:42 favorite mobile game i'm gonna post an image in general of my favorite fucking scene from mafias
01:13:48 city and it's just like please it's unbelievable i gotta see if i can find it real quick okay all
01:13:55 right is that the one where it's like you know the level zero something and then like the the
01:14:02 level 100 boss yeah yeah yeah yeah it's good shit but the afk arena has taken the the you know level
01:14:12 one brain mafias city format and turned it to a level 10 anime version of that which is obviously
01:14:19 superior i've never seen an advertisement in my whole life i don't know why actually i do have
01:14:26 ad blocker on my on my desktop it's on my phone i always get ads for this shit because i cannot
01:14:31 use ad blocker on my phone yeah yeah that's my favorite one man a level 10 hit man you can my
01:14:38 favorite part is the extremely low res texture in the background tractor this is what a level 10
01:14:44 hit man looks like in real life this is tools of the trade uh congrats he did he earned that 25
01:14:51 thousand dollars all right go look at that lays gents uh all right next up okay okay we have
01:14:58 another voicemail uh this one is called radcon five idea uh take it away go relevant voicemail
01:15:06 since you guys have a guest hey fit i'm thinking guest lecture at next radcon maybe i mean a two

01:15:23 get you guys a lot of views and she you know oh my god there's actually there's a lot of
01:15:31 wall cows on two b two t that might be worthy of a full on lecture really sure sure man i yeah
01:15:40 your videos are very much in the same style well i would watch a video about that i would sit in
01:15:47 the front of somebody doing a lecture about that i me too i um hey possibilities there doors open
01:15:54 yeah our people will call your people we had uh we had zen we had zen visit uh uh yeah very briefly
01:16:02 yeah stretch goal stretch goals hey possible we kicked him out as soon as we could but he did
01:16:09 manage to weasel his way in there briefly that's true he was in the tarantino cast and uh one or
01:16:15 two other things as i recall uh well there you go uh agreed even if fit didn't do it or anybody
01:16:20 the two b two t lore stuff is exactly the kind of thing that i think makes for a great lecture
01:16:25 and his his videos his story had been kind of about that exact shit all right next voicemail
01:16:31 we got tectonic improv go so you guys like fully cooly right and nate did that video on lucifer and
01:16:38 the biscuit hammer um i have a question what in the hell is a biscuit hammer the reason i bring
01:16:45 up fully cooly is because the pillows obviously did the soundtrack to that and they have a song
01:16:50 called biscuit hammer but it came out in like 2002 or something and then lucifer and the biscuit
01:16:56 hammer came out in 2005 so what's the connection here because i tried looking it up and i couldn't
01:17:01 get anything i only got like stuff on lucifer and the biscuit hammer is it like like an actual hammer
01:17:07 that you use to like make biscuits with or something i have no fucking clue what this is can you guys help
01:17:12 me uh this is you know i hear people ask questions about this sometimes or be confused very simple
01:17:19 answer it's just that lucifer and the biscuit hammer is it just it does what jojo does jojo
01:17:25 just names things after albums or songs or whatever lucifer the biscuit hammer just named a bunch of
01:17:30 stuff after pillows songs uh that's that's that's that's a full extent okay follow up question is
01:17:37 why is there a pillow song called biscuit hammer i was gonna i wish i knew the answer to that
01:17:42 alas i do not i don't know since it's this uh an original song and songs mean you know usually
01:17:49 do this don't mean anything there's titles that is yeah like you could just be like hey what if
01:17:54 like there was a hammer specifically for smashing biscuits that'd be funny
01:17:59 i'm going to genius page on internet it's all in japanese though i somebody translated it
01:18:07 i'm sure there's some meaning i'm sure some simple googling would would determine the origin of this
01:18:12 but i don't know how they translate japanese people will will have a lot to do with it
01:18:18 maybe it means something else i don't know because biscuit means something in america and the uk
01:18:23 that's true that's what you call cookies maybe in japan maybe in japan it's something else
01:18:29 you know which even we know that there's two definitions of the word biscuit at least between
01:18:33 our two countries or whatever which one are these japanese individuals using i don't know is it a
01:18:38 cookie or is it a kentucky southern biscuit kind of thing yeah getting the gravy and whatnot i don't
01:18:44 know i would love that uh okay here we go oh you know what i was gonna say uh fit having you around

01:22:55 going to post the link right now like this kind of shit uh yeah yeah i i yeah hey man don't
01:23:02 oh i don't like it until you've tried it i i know i like the occasional like uh rain sounds like asmr
01:23:10 um yeah i put on i've been putting on rain sounds every night to sleep it's good i have
01:23:17 one i have one particular i'm like i'm very picky about my rain sounds because if like it's too muddled
01:23:23 or like if there's thunder or if like it's yeah i have to be able to hear the individual drops
01:23:29 if like the drops have to be heavy or it's worthless so you know i got mine here under
01:23:36 particularly too yeah like a like a rain sound that it's like hitting a tarp and it's going
01:23:40 this is it this this is the one this is the one this is the sound of my life
01:23:46 except no substitutes okay cool cool i'll i'll listen to it i know that feel although the sound
01:23:52 of rain on a tarp does take me back to my boy scout days when i heard a lot of that and it was a
01:23:57 very relaxing time i think i would enjoy rain on a tarp sounds if they aren't too well they will
01:24:01 there at it there you go she's flashing oh wait this isn't a tent oh okay okay he's gotta be on a
01:24:07 like if it's if it's not if it's not raining on a tent what are you even fucking doing
01:24:11 what's even the point what's even the point of rain that's not on a tent
01:24:15 sure mine for rain is actually pretty good yeah like like on iran yeah that's our video that's just
01:24:22 like 10 hours minecraft rain that probably definitely oh my god gotta be i'm here yeah uh
01:24:29 fits next video rain and thunderstorm rain and thunderstorm at night 10 hours minecraft asmr
01:24:35 there you go oh god you know i missed the days of 2016 youtube where videos trended based on
01:24:42 how long they were watched for right like those types of videos were like insane for growth but
01:24:49 yeah it's not the same anymore our lecturers would have done even better in those days but
01:24:54 they still do very good oh man five hours imagine or imagine uploading like a 10 hour like a 10
01:25:01 hour like rain video you put ad breaks every like 15 minutes it gets millions of views yeah yeah
01:25:07 generates hundreds of dollars in revenue every single day that's the good shit people wouldn't
01:25:12 stand for ad breaks maybe like text ads oh they'll stand for it oh they'll watch what i tell you
01:25:17 they might it depends on the algorithm would force it in front of them right the whole point of an asmr
01:25:23 like two thing that happened like interrupt like hey you buy a product okay yes that's what i want
01:25:30 listen they'll do an advertisement asmr just like constant advertisements like layered on top of
01:25:36 each other reverbed not a bad idea appreciate although you know they will they will watch the
01:25:40 ads to support me the creator one person comes to mind i think her name's gb asmr she's she's
01:25:46 very well known one of the famous people who does it and uh i think she does a thing called sponsored
01:25:52 saturday which basically just means it's a whatever normal asmr video but at the beginning
01:25:58 she doesn't add but she just does it talking softly about whatever she has to say for the ad
01:26:03 and it it doesn't break the you know it works it works just fine for for listening to person talk
01:26:09 the you know i've been thinking recently the thing that annoys me the most about asmr is
01:26:15 i don't know because i mostly listen to people talking specifically i prefer the male voice i
01:26:19 find it relaxing and it's they they really are just fill in time man they will just find words
01:26:28 to say and they will just say those words and it is annoying i wish that there was a little more
01:26:34 substance to what people are saying the amount of like filler content that is stuffed in there
01:26:41 just to justify the runtime you know it's the game they're playing so i get it but when someone's
01:26:47 has said in 10 different ways like how i can't even think of of anything specific like you are
01:26:55 like a beautiful majestic creature and like everything is good and nothing is bad and they
01:27:04 just go on loops well it makes you feel better in like 20 years they're gonna have like ai
01:27:10 generated asmr and all the problems are gonna go away nate it's gonna be fantastic as will we
01:27:17 as we're phased out as a species and i look forward to it i can't wait for the ai generated
01:27:23 youtubers who have ai generated drama with other ai generated youtube
01:27:30 that's exciting stuff all right let's go on to our next voicemail but by the way two other albums
01:27:36 that are great go listen to you these are also famous mu core loveless by my bloody valentine
01:27:42 the essential shoegaze album give it a listen you probably love it and also prince's gold experience
01:27:49 yes it is le jo jo reference you are welcome uh great album great album more voice all right
01:27:57 yes all right here we go here we go this one is simply titled escape the voice jail all right go
01:28:07 it's been one week since i've been imprisoned in the voice jail for crimes against die buster
01:28:12 or not if i got this recording in too late it's been rough every time it's warden nate best
01:28:18 been shift he calls me dumb and gay which is really messed up because i'm not even gay
01:28:23 it's okay though i find solace in the dramatic irony of nate saying we'll never hear from fuck
01:28:28 die buster again and then immediately playing my next voicemail it gets me through the day
01:28:35 that and warden hypocrite the only member clever enough to see through my disguise and not altering
01:28:39 my monotone at all it gives me crayons and we doodle together chill dude can't say the same for the
01:28:46 rest of the wardens though then saint has been trying to convert me to communism indigibro keeps
01:28:51 placing me on various charts bad autism going insane in here need to break out nate i can't
01:28:59 believe you would give him there is a core the suck core yeah playing the satisfaction of playing
01:29:05 his his his male nate it's supposed to be that's true and that he's solitary that's true that's true
01:29:13 but i find this to be something to live for he what see what's the point of imprisoning someone
01:29:18 in the voice jail if not to have his story be available to others as a cautionary tale so his
01:29:25 suffering soft is being put on display so others can learn you think so remember what he said about
01:29:30 die buster he said he said he didn't like that's a bad thing he said i don't like that themes were bad
01:29:36 no that is a criminal offense you're absolutely right about that okay i will live and learn uh
01:29:41 forgive me let's try uh okay hey some helpful notes uh more cruelty less mercy less forgiveness uh
01:29:50 right okay okay uh relevant male here i think i like asmr now no what that's the voicemail
01:29:58 that's the name of the voicemail okay let's hear what he has to say so i never understood
01:30:04 nate's love for asmr i always thought it was weird and creepy and yeah his love for it was
01:30:11 probably sexual in nature yeah but i recently fell down a youtube rabbit hole of this channel
01:30:19 called cracking the cryptic in which a very nice and calm british man solves really hard
01:30:28 sudoku puzzles and all you hear is his nice calming voice and the quiet clicking of his
01:30:34 mouse as he gets more and more excited about finishing a sudoku puzzle over the course of
01:30:40 30 minutes or so and it's awesome so shout out to cracking the cryptic and also i i guess i'm a
01:30:47 freak who likes asmr now that's fucked up that's not asmr that's just a quiet man that's just a
01:30:53 bob ross asmr yeah like would you classify bob ross people say that all the time like a person
01:30:58 who is not shouting constantly i someone who is not usually a youtuber on youtube must be the bob
01:31:04 ross of whatever they're doing look asmr is different but a little bit like sexuality in that
01:31:11 you can be doing nothing or just standing there and someone can just find that attractive or
01:31:18 arousing or whatever like it could just be like your voice or something about you or it doesn't
01:31:22 have to be a person it could be anything um you know some drawing or art or whatever that you didn't
01:31:26 intend to be that way but people just interpret it that way so like what is bob ross asmr most people
01:31:33 believe that he is but like that wasn't the point um no that that has to be a fringe opinion
01:31:41 bob ross i mean i'm not saying he's a paint man he is a paint man i would never say that like he
01:31:48 was an intentional asmr guy but i just think that like nobody you don't get the head thing
01:31:54 about from bob ross nobody does it's impossible i mean i never have either but still i find it
01:32:00 relaxing to listen to it seems like it i don't know i don't think that being relaxing to listen to
01:32:05 makes it asmr i don't know it's just a definitional it just sounds like this guy's trying to commit
01:32:11 honorable sudoku and that's what his channel is about
01:32:17 oh wait wait if you go through i really like sudoku i'm i'm really into sudoku there was a
01:32:22 there's a video like i made where it's like a sudoku with only four numbers huh and uh there
01:32:30 was some stipulations like the the night's move like a number could not be in an l shape to the
01:32:36 same number and the center square had to be a magic square where each row had to add up to the
01:32:42 same number and diagonal and stuff it was like using those stipulations it was actually possible
01:32:48 and i paused the video at the beginning and i figured out quite a lot of it i ended up failing
01:32:52 because i missed something halfway i couldn't remember where but it was so fun like i would get
01:32:56 stuck and be like oh dang it i clicked back on the guy and he's like hmm well well because this
01:33:03 and this and this therefore this and that and i'm like wow yeah yeah he's so smart now i'm smart
01:33:08 because i learned from him oh my god i see there's a comment on that rain video this guy says i
01:33:14 like this one because i can clearly hear the raindrops it's not blurred into white noise there
01:33:18 you go cj wonder struck 25 gets me i'm not the only one you know this this just reminds me that
01:33:28 the other day in my nuzlocke i was playing poke no i keep thinking pokeball flip but it's voltorb
01:33:34 flip the whatever the fuck it is oh shit i've got a video playing stop stop anyway voltorb flip is
01:33:41 the most brain breaking uh ahego inducing uh dojin you know mind break experience in any pokemon
01:33:51 game and i i'm way too stupid to do it reliably and eventually i got better but it was kind of
01:33:59 a nightmare and that game is bad and basically what i'm saying is i don't enjoy logic puzzles
01:34:03 because they're too hard and i'm stupid and that's just the fact jack damn there you go love logic
01:34:11 i'm so fucking smart i put a number in the right way so many things in your head i can't do it
01:34:17 you have to know like oh because this probability exists here there's like a probability cloud
01:34:21 that it now exists and there's like a totally separate probability cloud and you have to recognize
01:34:26 where those things intersect in logic brain functions and it's too hard i can't do it
01:34:33 nice my brain works very well i mean in sudoku at least period end of sentence there's there's a
01:34:38 few things where it's like sometimes i'm like i've got a lot of uh like things filled in but
01:34:44 there's like one number i can't i need this number to figure out everything else and so i try so
01:34:49 hard to find this number and in order to do it i need to like say okay so i do like a hypothesis
01:34:55 a hypothetical situation if the seven is here right that means the seven can't be here which means
01:35:00 the seven can't be there which means the seven can't be there which means that needs to be a six
01:35:03 this needs to be a five and that doesn't work so i have to go all the way back and put the seven in
01:35:08 the other spot and then it works and it's it's fun i it's really fun i get so scared physically
01:35:14 terrified of all the like maybes and i can't keep track of all the things that are definite versus
01:35:20 like probable versus we don't know oh god that's what the little notes are in sudoku where you put
01:35:26 the little number yeah you're right you're right possible it's too scary i'm already scared just
01:35:33 thinking about it all right well if you like it go check out crapton the cryptic everybody
01:35:38 all right next voicemail is called ellie is our fix it take it away i don't know if the last voicemail
01:35:44 sent about this topic uh went through because the uploading was kind of weird but anyways i'm just
01:35:48 going to speak fast to make for it uh so ellie's are the editor of the pcp fucked up in last week's
01:35:54 episode because he has a timestamp of this in the description there's a part talking about the final
01:35:59 seven spells that was a voicemail that i sent and then right after nate talks about his fucking
01:36:03 pokemon streams because there's another voicemail talking about these pokemon streams and he fucking
01:36:07 flipped the goddamn voicemail audio uh so it's like wrong they have the wrong reaction to each of
01:36:13 those two voicemails ellie's are you cuck idiot fix this oh man rest in peace ellie's are oh god
01:36:23 we're in the chat ellie's are typing right now oh no he just says the fuck that guy is what he
01:36:30 says in the chat i'm just gonna ask him is this accurate either way don't care pussy bitch
01:36:41 i think um even if this guy is an accurate i like i think it was it was true and ellie's are
01:36:47 noticed it in the the comments of the video and somebody said it and he replied like um
01:36:54 that was just the order that they came in which says to me that he didn't listen to it so it's
01:36:59 still a bad it does that's no excuse that's no excuse and i think we're gonna have to lash
01:37:05 we're gonna have to bring out the whip this time oh my god fucking ellie's are he is saying it's
01:37:09 true but i put them in the order that you sent me do your job ellie's are uh listen to the episode
01:37:17 bro okay but this is one minor flaw in a stellar history of ellie's are editing work so who could
01:37:23 be who could be too mad but hopefully he knows it could be uh they could be out of order on occasion
01:37:29 all right next one we got oh yes excellent uh we've got i'll die groveling
01:37:36 begs and pleads for mercy that is the full title okay let's hear what he has to say go
01:37:42 me a little less than a year ago i'm working the hustle making an amv i think hey i could
01:37:47 advertise it in a voicemail why not oh overstepped my bounds got sent straight to voice jail that's
01:37:52 okay i can respect it's reasonable but what's not reasonable is that like two weeks ago you sent
01:37:57 someone who thinks that die buster is shit in there and listen i love die buster that's the
01:38:03 problem i can't stand it in here anymore i've done my time now it the punishment far outweighs the
01:38:08 crime at this point you may i she's my favorite fucking director i can't i can't be seen in the
01:38:13 same list of names as this creature i gotta get out of here please please first of all his name is
01:38:21 surumaki who directed fully coolly and fucking uh die buster so oh embarrassing embarrassing moment
01:38:29 right there truly a bra moment um he may she wasn't maybe he was involved maybe he was like
01:38:34 producer or something i don't fucking know uh okay but but ben what do you think do we have any
01:38:40 policy for forgiveness or allowing people to come back into a polite society after they've been so
01:38:46 excoriated for such a long time i think ben's muted so he might not answer this so give
01:38:52 any any feelings about the should we forgive those who are repentant after some period of time
01:38:58 nah you don't get out of jail by just saying please let me out please that's not our words okay but
01:39:04 normally with jail there is like a time you you go in for a certain number not this is this is this
01:39:10 is the worst jail of all it's a meritocracy you have to be cool enough to get out that's i
01:39:15 suppose yeah you have to not just say i'm sad that i'm here with fuck die buster uh even though i
01:39:20 fuck up the director in bed truly embarrassing um you have to in fact just give us something cool
01:39:27 and then perhaps you could be saved like your old i'll die corporation stuff that we all enjoyed
01:39:31 but then that's funny he made a bunch of great voicemails we'd made one minor infraction after
01:39:36 contributing to the show and forever is in jail and there's no hope of redemption uh unless
01:39:43 uh who knows who knows maybe one day maybe one day all right anyway let's let's just move on to
01:39:48 our next one we have the notorious f a g calling with a voicemail let's hear away i'm back what did
01:39:57 i miss oh yeah yeah okay bed you can weigh in quickly let him uh did you hear the voicemail
01:40:02 did you hear that um no mercy no i did hear no mercy no no mercy but do you have any thoughts
01:40:09 on an eventual potential redemption plan for anyone in voice jail um he uh um no no never
01:40:20 okay no no one we're all clear understood understood uh has there ever been anyone who
01:40:26 has left voice only way to get wait the yeah i think someone went from voice i think someone
01:40:32 did voice grail or maybe the other way around but like it didn't we say i know the other way you
01:40:36 are in you can sacrifice your voice grail status to rescue someone from voice jail right oh so you
01:40:44 know who would ever do for leet strats you know what if you were if tactically i'll die you could
01:40:49 have someone else uh like call in work with them on a production to make it good so that they get
01:40:55 into voice grail and then they could use their status now as part of the voice grail to to free
01:41:01 you or you could just use them as a patsy you know to get uh to get the name on the on the board
01:41:06 and they could use that there's one plan do with it what you will all right anyway let's listen to
01:41:11 the norious notorious fag i've been dying to hear from all right go hey pcp the notorious fag here
01:41:20 so how do you guys feel about the fact that my little pony is on the official evil lineup
01:41:28 also what are your thoughts in general about them fighting herbs
01:41:32 and if you haven't seen it's a pretty cool fighting game i recommend that a lot sure yeah yeah yeah
01:41:40 um yeah i know i know about them fighting anyway this is i have no opinion i don't know how to end
01:41:45 this i don't know how to end this shut up just stop that doesn't know um wait wait so okay yeah go on
01:41:52 so what was that about like my little pony is the official evil list line okay first of all if you
01:41:58 don't know what evo is oh he's like the biggest yeah the biggest fighting game way event so he's
01:42:04 oh evo so he's saying that them's fighting herds is an evo okay but but hang on like the i played
01:42:09 this because there was an interesting thing i went to the evo website and looked at the games
01:42:15 first of all it's not among the games being played at evo so i don't know what that's about and
01:42:21 second of all at the top of the thing it says evo 2020 has been canceled so double
01:42:28 not happening wait hold on i just found something posted three days ago that says evo 2020 will be
01:42:36 all online features four new games and it's this says one of them is uh uh them's fighting herds
01:42:44 well shit i guess they're just main website hasn't been updated which is their fault not mine
01:42:49 but uh okay how cool how long ago did they say it's canceled this update you know it doesn't say
01:42:57 exactly when this was posted uh i mean probably the last you know month or two i don't know um
01:43:03 even maybe this happened like yesterday or something i don't know i mean there's not
01:43:08 much to think about it them's fighting herds was like it used to be a my little pony fan game and
01:43:13 then yeah hasbro said no you can't do that and so it became an independent project and now it's just
01:43:18 about animals beating the shit out of each other designed by lauren fast which is pretty cool yeah
01:43:22 and it's like it's a it's a cute little game and i i don't know it looks all right the like it being
01:43:28 in evo means very little um i agree i mean i guess it means it's got a like community around it and
01:43:37 it's considered to be like balanced enough that it's a it's a worthwhile game to compete at so good
01:43:43 i guess i i guess i think it's cool smash bros melee is it in that list of added games because
01:43:50 i'm still pissed that melee has been removed from evo which is by far the game i'm most interested
01:43:55 in fuck modern smash don't care melee is way more interesting to me i mean i don't follow it follow
01:44:00 any esports at all but that seems strange because it's so big isn't it melee still uh yeah at least
01:44:08 maybe i'm like not in the scene and it actually is just like a vocal minority group or something
01:44:13 but to me it seemed like the most popular fighting game like period except maybe for like street
01:44:18 fighters and maybe modern i think maybe i'm incorrect on this didn't they get like pressure from
01:44:24 nintendo to drop melee at evo i think there was some something like that going on keeps selling that
01:44:30 game and i think it was a big issue for the evo staff because you needed like the crt televisions
01:44:36 or whatever and they were fucking heavy to like take in and out maybe if they hit the gym instead
01:44:42 of their pillow with virgin rage every night then they could lift those crt tvs and it wouldn't be
01:44:48 an issue plus if it got added i'm curious how they'll do it because there's no net play on the
01:44:53 game cube so they'd have to use an emulator right that is true which could introduce concerns and
01:45:00 issues and yeah you know okay okay but but they only did the online thing recently they cancelled
01:45:06 it i think like last year is when they announced it before we knew any of this online stuff you
01:45:10 know those concerns are reasonable they cancelled having to use special technical stuff uh yeah
01:45:16 yeah it was like months and months ago why why was it cancelled i think some other i mean maybe
01:45:21 because of fitz reason i a lot of people were wondering that i think i saw a video talking
01:45:26 about it um i can't remember exactly but it was just sort of like management is bad evo bad
01:45:34 you know there are reasonable concerns like technically like he was saying and if nintendo
01:45:39 is like breathing down your neck about it i mean they should have no right whatsoever but excuse me
01:45:45 that was uh e3 i think so it was it was some big thing that nobody cares about anymore that sounds
01:45:52 like e3 definitely all right we've got one last voicemail we might as well get to and this is um
01:45:59 riddle my ass batman i r l okay take it away my my hero my favorite he's back baby okay
