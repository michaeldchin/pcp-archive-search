00:00:00 Good-bye-o-gizai-mas.
00:00:04 Rowdy.
00:00:06 Fucker.
00:00:08 Cot.
00:00:09 Killer.
00:00:11 In. Minecraft.
00:00:13 Minecraft.
00:00:15 You know, I understand that this game is banned in schools across the country because of its seditious remarks against certain ethnicities and its pivotal role in leading to World War II, but I think that Minecraft,
00:00:29 may have some relevance to our current economic and political situation, so we're reviving it for this let's play, if you get what I'm trying to say.
00:00:38 I don't, I don't, oh wait, reviving it.
00:00:43 Oh, right.
00:00:45 What the fuck is happening right now? I've not played Minecraft in like years, so I have no idea what I'm in for. This is a nightmare though.
00:00:52 I was building the world.
00:00:54 I guess so, I guess so.
00:00:57 This should have fucking figured it out. Hey, great. You started the video game.
00:01:03 It's amazing, isn't it?
00:01:04 That's spectacular.
00:01:06 Ben.
00:01:07 Hey, what happened to the fucking, what happened to RFCK Texture Paki, dummy?
00:01:10 We were just talking about it. I don't have it installed.
00:01:13 I want to call attention to the fact that you should have it.
00:01:17 I don't know where it is. I haven't, my long story to history with Minecraft is I played it when I was a kid, and my, eventually they had to update all of their stuff.
00:01:26 They had to update all of their servers, right? So they had to consolidate power because they were about my Microsoft.
00:01:31 So my old, ooh, ravine, my old Minecraft Gmail was unfortunately got corrupted and I was no able to log in.
00:01:39 So just for like a couple years there, I wasn't able to play Minecraft, even though I had rightfully bought it to their acquisition by Minecraft, or by Microsoft and their evil, evil, corrupt policy.
00:01:49 So I'm playing again, or making the Minecraft come back.
00:01:55 Ben.
00:01:56 Naturally.
00:01:57 Yeah.
00:01:58 Two years of Rowdy fuckers cop killers. I guess not. I mean, we've been going for that for like four years or something, I think.
00:02:04 But now, two years of Endless War.
00:02:07 Two years of Endless War.
00:02:09 When was the first, ooh, I wonder when the first Rowdy fucker, not Endless War, but Rowdy fuckers was.
00:02:17 I remember off the top of my head, it was like very, very close to two years before the start of Endless War.
00:02:25 Like within the span of a week, I believe.
00:02:29 Hmm.
00:02:32 Let's find out.
00:02:33 Yeah, let's do it.
00:02:34 Let's uh...
00:02:37 Okay, I see.
00:02:38 Okay, the first one, Nuclear Throne was April 11th, 2016.
00:02:46 So, almost four years ago.
00:02:51 Time flies, doesn't it?
00:02:52 Where does it all go?
00:02:57 At that point, that was like, I'm trying to think about the timeline here, because that was before Radcon 2, right?
00:03:04 That was before I think, I think that was just after Bronycon, right? Because it was definitely, I think it was before the first Radcon, actually.
00:03:12 Was I?
00:03:14 Oh, was that before I moved in with Digi?
00:03:17 I think it might have been, yeah, because the first Radcon's when you moved in with Digi, and I'm pretty sure the first RSC is before the first Radcon.
00:03:24 Yeah, um, I don't remember, like, in my mind, our FCK started, but I don't remember doing it before Radcon 1, but I think, but I guess we did, I don't know, okay.
00:03:42 I mean, it was a very, like, me and you and Davoo all just played Nuclear Throne, and we decided to do a podcast together, because we had all played Nuclear Throne.
00:03:51 Like, no, like, we were not deciding to make a whole new series or a whole new show, it was just like, you want to talk about Nuclear Throne and play it, and it turned into a clusterfuck.
00:04:00 Oh, got it. Dude, look at all these people.
00:04:04 Me and Tom just did something like that today, guess what we fucking recorded today?
00:04:09 The Bustercast, I saw.
00:04:11 The Bustercast.
00:04:12 It's very sad.
00:04:13 It's going up, it's going live in a matter of seconds.
00:04:17 For a while there, I thought that racial tensions were starting to ease and that we were starting to enter into a new realm of, you know, social awareness of the issues facing minorities, but I guess that-
00:04:27 That's because you're stupid is why you thought that.
00:04:29 I guess Ben St. came back and made racism legal again, that's unfortunate.
00:04:33 Hell yeah, dude.
00:04:38 Oh my god, Munn, epic.
00:04:41 Someone just died here, and I have no idea how or why. It's epic.
00:04:45 We just got back from a Radcon.
00:04:48 I think that you guys probably recorded an episode about it, but I was not there.
00:04:51 But I want to talk about Radcon 4, because it felt strange.
00:04:56 It was a very surreal experience doing a Radcon again after not doing it for so long.
00:05:00 And then the weird fact that it just flew by and it felt like it didn't even happen.
00:05:05 It felt so insubstantial.
00:05:06 Yeah, it felt like-
00:05:07 It was like a puff of air.
00:05:09 Even though it was so fucking long.
00:05:12 And it was agonizing. It was like cruel. It was cruel and unusual.
00:05:17 I mean it was fine, it was good, it was fun, but it was over in like a second.
00:05:23 There were a lot of like, you know, big recordings where we had to break out the Victor camera
00:05:29 and we had to, you know, film scenes over and over and over again.
00:05:33 Oh my god, what's happening? Where am I?
00:05:35 Oh, is this poison ivy?
00:05:38 Sweet berries. What the fuck?
00:05:43 I have no idea.
00:05:44 Yeah, it kills me. I don't understand why.
00:05:48 I didn't realize that Tom Oliver's channel is like 128 subscribers.
00:05:57 It's like, he has a personal channel that's like, never uses.
00:06:01 I guess his over on like Rebel, is it Rebel Pixel or Polystation 2?
00:06:06 That would be it, right?
00:06:08 Okay.
00:06:10 Why are you getting the stats?
00:06:13 I just want to fucking put it on the fucking, I just want to get it on the fucking, in the description, in the end card.
00:06:24 There, that's it, that's it, that's it.
00:06:26 Epic.
00:06:27 Yeah, okay.
00:06:28 But yeah, it was weirdly like, it wasn't even really hyped up because I forget what the initial impetus for it was,
00:06:36 but like Radcaud Ford just kind of like, it felt like the planning for it just kind of like happened in one meeting.
00:06:42 I feel like we were talking about the future of the show in one meeting and they were like, well, you know what we got to do is we got to do a Radcon.
00:06:47 And everyone was like, oh yeah, I guess so, huh?
00:06:49 And then we just started looking for houses and then the bull just started rolling like out of the blue really.
00:06:54 And then we planned it for like two months in advance and then it snuck up on us and then I was like, oh shit, I didn't prepare at all.
00:07:02 And so I spent all of Radcon preparing for my lecture.
00:07:06 And then we did those recordings.
00:07:08 It felt like it was just like, oh, a couple days and then it was over.
00:07:14 It felt weird because like a lot of the other Radcons, right?
00:07:17 It felt like they were like super long in a weird way where there was a lot of time just to like hang out and just like talk.
00:07:24 I mean, well, like I think a part of it may be that like a lot of the stuff involved all of us, right?
00:07:31 So there was not a lot of time for like some guys to be recording while other people were doing nothing.
00:07:38 There was a lot of like, we all have to be here or like none of us have to be here because they're saying it for another thing where we all have to be there, right?
00:07:44 I mean, a lot of us, more of us did lectures and the lectures went really long.
00:07:49 Like all, like more than most of the lectures were like four hours long or more.
00:07:53 Is that, is that, it felt like that? I don't know if that's true though, I think.
00:07:57 No, it is true, yours was fucking long, Nate's was fucking long, Tom's was fucking long.
00:08:02 Nate's felt like longer than it was. I was surprised that it was only like four hours.
00:08:10 I mean, I had to go and like lie down. It was too long for me, I couldn't handle it.
00:08:17 Nate's was the longest, but yours was not much, yours and Tom's were not much shorter.
00:08:22 Tom's is epic though, Tom's was so cool.
00:08:24 Tom's was epic, Tom's was too good.
00:08:26 Yeah, it's unfortunate.
00:08:32 I just want everyone, well, I mean, mine's my favorite, but Tom's, Tom's the second, Tom's the second place.
00:08:38 Right.
00:08:41 Okay, you know, I think Radcon 3 was like very unstructured.
00:08:50 We spend a lot of time at Radcon 3 like thinking of like, what should we do now?
00:08:55 Radcon 4, there was like never a moment where we were like, what should we do?
00:08:59 It was always like, here's what we're doing.
00:09:01 It's either here's what we have to do or here's like what we have been like planning to do,
00:09:05 AKA just like the lectures.
00:09:07 Yeah, yeah.
00:09:10 Do you think that that was, I mean, I guess, you know, there's no reason to fret really.
00:09:14 I don't think it's good or bad, but I do think it's why the time flew by so much.
00:09:20 Hmm.
00:09:21 And I had to leave like a day earlier.
00:09:23 Did anything happen on that final day?
00:09:25 Um, I don't, well, I mean, you missed, um, you missed Hippo's lecture, right?
00:09:31 Right, I did.
00:09:33 Other than, I mean, that, yeah, that and probably we did a stream.
00:09:37 So not really.
00:09:39 Okay.
00:09:41 It sucks though, because I didn't actually have to go.
00:09:44 The reason I went back home early is because I was going to go back to school,
00:09:48 but fucking, you know, coronavirus happened and no one was allowed back at school.
00:09:53 So I didn't even have to come back.
00:09:55 Sad, sadly.
00:09:57 Are you getting, um, so you're doing online classes now, right?
00:10:01 Yes, I'm doing online classes.
00:10:03 Please tell me.
00:10:05 Please tell me you don't have to pay full tuition to do online classes.
00:10:09 There is a refund for housing, but the tuition itself is not being refunded.
00:10:16 Well, that's bullshit.
00:10:19 Yeah, it's complete bullshit and like everyone is mad and there's, I mean, it's, I wouldn't say it's up in the air,
00:10:26 but like the pressure from what I can understand is immense to the point where things may change due to the backlash,
00:10:33 but I'm, I'm unsure.
00:10:35 It's almost like college is a big grift.
00:10:38 It is almost like that, isn't it?
00:10:41 You almost suspect.
00:10:44 But yeah, it's a nightmare.
00:10:46 Your life is, is your life changing at all?
00:10:49 No, I mean, functionally, no.
00:10:52 Well, the only thing that's different is that my roommates are around more and I'm playing board games with them sometimes.
00:10:59 That's pretty much it.
00:11:01 That's pretty cool.
00:11:02 That's a pretty positive social change.
00:11:04 I guess it's fine.
00:11:06 You would think so, but actually I feel bad.
00:11:09 I just, I don't know.
00:11:11 Something about, something about the enforced quarantine, even though I didn't leave my house much before,
00:11:17 not being able to like makes me upset.
00:11:20 Oh, totally.
00:11:21 Well, I mean, you know.
00:11:22 I feel mad all the time.
00:11:24 Yeah.
00:11:25 At the government or at the situation before the world.
00:11:29 I just feel, no, it's not, I don't feel mad.
00:11:32 I just feel, I despair.
00:11:36 It's like, I don't know, up until now, I've been like a homebody.
00:11:41 I don't go out very much.
00:11:43 And it's been like, okay, okay, but I could if I ever wanted to.
00:11:46 And now I can't.
00:11:48 And it's like a puncture.
00:11:50 It's like an exclamation point at the end of a sentence.
00:11:53 Or at the beginning of a text to man to be worn out.
00:11:56 It's like, yeah, yeah.
00:11:58 If you get what I'm trying to say, yeah.
00:12:00 And it's like, it's like, well now, you know, hey, you've been doing this anyway, right?
00:12:06 It's like, well here, now you got to do it.
00:12:08 And I'm like, oh, this makes me feel bad.
00:12:12 I would, I get what you're saying.
00:12:14 It's almost.
00:12:15 Now that the privilege has been taken away from me, I suddenly want it back.
00:12:19 It's, it was weirdly, it's, it's strange.
00:12:22 It feels like coronavirus really snuck up on me.
00:12:25 Like with Radcon 4 where it was like, I knew about it, obviously.
00:12:29 Everyone knew about it for a long time.
00:12:31 But then like during Radcon, it went from far away issue to like, you know, oh, now we have to stay inside forever.
00:12:38 Like, you know, we don't get to go outside.
00:12:40 It just is like a new thing.
00:12:41 And it's weird because it's like, I would wager like maybe me the most, maybe not the most.
00:12:47 That's somewhat bold, but like I am one of the more shut in PCP members.
00:12:52 I, I, before college specifically, like I did not leave the house because I was in like a suburb of California,
00:12:58 which is like AKA a prison in all but name.
00:13:01 And there was no way for me to go anywhere.
00:13:04 So I just stayed in the house the entire time, like all of my days.
00:13:08 And so it would, you would think that it was like, I don't know, I'm just going back to the way things were.
00:13:13 I'm just going back to like pre-college munchie.
00:13:15 But now it's like, I've become so accustomed to going outside every single day where it feels like,
00:13:20 I can't believe anyone lives like this.
00:13:22 I can't believe that this is how I used to be.
00:13:24 It's insane.
00:13:25 Yeah.
00:13:26 Yeah.
00:13:27 Um.
00:13:28 Mm.
00:13:29 Mm.
00:13:30 Yeah.
00:13:32 Yeah.
00:13:34 It makes you like, it's upsetting and it makes me mad.
00:13:36 That's all I have to say.
00:13:37 I feel bad constantly.
00:13:38 That's it.
00:13:39 It's not a good scenario.
00:13:41 No.
00:13:42 It makes you like, for me at least, it makes me cherish all the excuses I can give myself where it's like,
00:13:48 oh, well, I have to go outside because I have to eat food, right?
00:13:51 Like this, you know, that's valid.
00:13:53 But it's like, you know, it's weird that I have to like play this game with myself where it's like,
00:13:59 I cherish all the opportunities where normally they would be chores where it's like,
00:14:03 you know, before going to the grocery store, it's like, oh God, just fucking kill me.
00:14:07 I don't want to leave the house.
00:14:08 But now it's like, I'm leaping at every opportunity.
00:14:11 Oh, we're alone on bananas?
00:14:12 Dude, don't fucking worry.
00:14:13 Dude, I got bananas.
00:14:14 We got bananas at the grocery store.
00:14:15 I'll be right fucking back.
00:14:16 Don't worry, dude.
00:14:17 I got you.
00:14:18 I went to Whole Foods yesterday and I like fucking geared myself up like a wasteland warrior.
00:14:28 Like I was wearing like my mask and my bandana and like, you know, wearing gloves and shit.
00:14:34 I look like I was looking very post-apocalyptic.
00:14:37 I'm looking like an Antifa super soldier.
00:14:40 People are saying like, you know, oh, you live in interesting times like apocalypse.
00:14:44 Oh, well, you know, how, how interesting you should mind this for creative pieces.
00:14:49 But like, it's most boring apocalypse humanly imagined.
00:14:52 It's the most boring interesting times I can easily imagine.
00:14:55 It's not like, you know, people are out there in the streets.
00:14:58 There's like a revolution happening or anything.
00:15:00 It's not like there's anything really happening.
00:15:03 It's the lack of anything.
00:15:05 It's just boring.
00:15:06 It's the most boring interesting times that I can imagine.
00:15:11 This is probably how history feels most of the time.
00:15:15 I guess.
00:15:16 It's like bad.
00:15:17 You know, I guess that's a very privileged thing to say.
00:15:19 You know, nobody likes.
00:15:21 Huh? What?
00:15:22 I was just going to say it's a very privileged thing to say like what I was saying that it's like, you know,
00:15:26 I could be like, oh, it's very boring, but you know, people are fucking dying.
00:15:30 But from my perspective, I assume most of the people watching this show, it's probably going to feel the same.
00:15:37 Um, I think, um, probably like wars probably feel mostly like super boring too.
00:15:47 You know, like it's not like when there's a war on, it's like constant action.
00:15:53 It's like, you know, probably a long time of like nothing happening and you're afraid.
00:15:58 And then maybe if you're unlucky, something happens really fast and then you're dead.
00:16:03 Yeah.
00:16:04 If you're lucky.
00:16:05 I said unlucky.
00:16:06 Okay.
00:16:07 Um.
00:16:08 Hmm.
00:16:09 Hmm.
00:16:10 How long do you think this is going to last?
00:16:16 This podcast?
00:16:17 Oh, I can't be over fast enough.
00:16:19 I know.
00:16:20 The coronavirus.
00:16:21 Um.
00:16:22 Couple months.
00:16:23 Yeah.
00:16:24 I really wanted to do another rfckcon and I was planning to do it like this summer around
00:16:33 like when I got out of school, maybe even around this time because you know, anniversary
00:16:37 and stuff.
00:16:38 But you know, this obviously.
00:16:41 Hmm.
00:16:42 How does it travel?
00:16:43 Ski?
00:16:44 We kawai you to coin an oriental phrase from my long times in the Ottoman Empire.
00:16:51 Um.
00:16:54 Those are like the coolest things about endless war is the meetups.
00:16:58 The Ottoman Empire?
00:16:59 No, not that one.
00:17:00 Are you fucking free?
00:17:01 Yeah, not.
00:17:02 Well, that, you know, that's a big part of it too, honestly.
00:17:05 Um.
00:17:06 The meat.
00:17:07 I mean, the meetups feel very different from like what the game actually is.
00:17:13 You know what I mean?
00:17:14 Well, yeah.
00:17:15 Okay.
00:17:16 Yeah.
00:17:17 We're not shooting each other.
00:17:18 Well, we are.
00:17:19 Yeah.
00:17:20 I don't know.
00:17:21 Whatever.
00:17:22 Maybe this is dumb, but like they feel very, they feel disconnected from the game itself.
00:17:27 They kind of feel just like a separate thing.
00:17:29 I have no idea like what that's supposed to mean.
00:17:33 Like of course they're separate things like.
00:17:34 Yeah, of course they're separate things, but I mean they.
00:17:39 I don't know.
00:17:40 I mean they're.
00:17:41 I don't know.
00:17:43 Yeah.
00:17:44 Yeah.
00:17:45 Shut up.
00:17:46 Epic.
00:17:47 Um.
00:17:48 I'm stupid.
00:17:49 Don't worry about it.
00:17:51 It was really cool.
00:17:52 The last one where we were just inside this old grandma's house and we were able to just
00:17:58 like chip, like, you know, kick back and hang in this weird sort of like goofy, silly old
00:18:04 Boston house and just screaming about slime and rave and do the lecture, which was epic
00:18:11 and has a bunch of new people playing the game again for this game system for the first
00:18:16 time in like a billion years is really breathed some life into the game.
00:18:21 It's pretty epic.
00:18:22 Pretty, pretty down for it.
00:18:24 Pretty into it.
00:18:25 Oh God.
00:18:26 Jesus Christ.
00:18:28 Um.
00:18:29 It's some lava.
00:18:30 Look at this.
00:18:31 How many, how many people like joined?
00:18:33 Diamonds.
00:18:34 Did a lot of people join after like the lecture?
00:18:36 Did that do anything?
00:18:37 A lot of people joined after the lecture.
00:18:39 That's what I was just saying is that there's like a ton of new people, a ton of new faces
00:18:44 and they're all pretty epic.
00:18:45 If you ask me.
00:18:46 Well, you say it.
00:18:47 Well, how many, how many is a lot?
00:18:49 Do we have numbers?
00:18:50 Well, it depends on how like what you want to know by how many people because like technically
00:18:56 I think like now it's keeping track.
00:18:57 I think there was like something like over a hundred new people joined the game.
00:19:02 But as in they entered the server, but there's a decent, I would say, I would say like upwards
00:19:07 of like 40 new like faces who have talked and interacted.
00:19:11 I actually did.
00:19:12 That's a lot.
00:19:13 It is quite a few.
00:19:14 I know.
00:19:15 Exactly.
00:19:16 Um, I hosted a tour of the city.
00:19:18 I went on speed Levich and I did a tour of Lakhakan where I just like add every new guy.
00:19:25 Meet me in downtown.
00:19:26 We're going to go to every district and tell you what happened in each district and what
00:19:29 the deal is with it.
00:19:30 And it was really cool to see so many people like, you know, the game has been up for two
00:19:35 years.
00:19:36 You think this is as big as it's ever going to get.
00:19:38 This is all the people who are ever going to play this game.
00:19:41 This is it.
00:19:42 Uh, and then you have all these people being surprised when I tell them about like how
00:19:45 the food core works.
00:19:46 And dude like, dude, talk about in case you're in this game, like what?
00:19:51 I know.
00:19:54 Yeah.
00:19:55 Yeah.
00:19:56 Okay.
00:19:57 I see.
00:19:58 Maybe there's some life to this thing yet.
00:20:01 Maybe.
00:20:02 Maybe we've did.
00:20:04 Maybe it wasn't all for nothing.
00:20:08 Um, I always think about.
00:20:11 Yeah.
00:20:12 I am at.
00:20:13 Okay.
00:20:14 Sorry.
00:20:15 But as I just released the Buster cast and right now I am trying, I planned it out very
00:20:19 specifically.
00:20:20 I have like two very specific places where I want to put ad breaks.
00:20:23 So I got, I got to scrub through and find like, exactly, exactly the place for perfect
00:20:29 for maximum artistic, artistic merit.
00:20:33 Okay.
00:20:34 Any, what were you saying?
00:20:35 Uh, I was going to say something about RFCK new players.
00:20:40 Oh, oh, I was going to say, I always think about how like I have this sort of weird.
00:20:47 I would say it's probably influenced by the fact that I, you know, we're a part of this
00:20:52 greater sort of analysis film critique YouTuber regurgitation sphere.
00:20:57 But I always think about zooming out and viewing our shows in the context of like, I wonder
00:21:03 what people are going to say when this shit eventually ends because everything has to
00:21:06 end.
00:21:07 And I'm wondering about, I always think about, it's probably not helpful, but I think about
00:21:11 like where we are on the timeline of like, I wonder how long this is going to last.
00:21:16 I wonder how long RFCK is going to be a thing, not just like me and you, but I wonder how
00:21:20 long like the server will exist as like endless war people are playing.
00:21:25 I mean, I guess it's the sort of thing where theoretically could go forever, right?
00:21:29 There's no natural end point.
00:21:31 So, I mean, I imagine it will end when like, Discord is no longer widely used.
00:21:40 I don't see why it would end before that.
00:21:44 Skype 2 comes out and everyone flocks back.
00:21:47 Yeah, basically.
00:21:49 I mean, that or like, like if Discord stops being, and I mean, even then we might, we
00:21:58 might just like port it somehow.
00:22:00 I don't know.
00:22:01 There would probably be like a big initiative.
00:22:03 I mean, unless like interest is completely like fall into zero, we would, I imagine there
00:22:09 would be an effort to, you know, yeah, port it to the new, to a new platform or whatever,
00:22:15 which I'm sure could be done with enough dedication and elbow grease.
00:22:21 I just wonder if it'll, I don't know.
00:22:23 I feel very, I think it's part of the fact that we're inside all the time again.
00:22:29 I feel very reflective nowadays.
00:22:32 I do too.
00:22:33 I feel, I think about death all the time now.
00:22:36 Yeah.
00:22:37 You think it's tied to Rona, Bra?
00:22:40 No.
00:22:41 Okay.
00:22:42 No.
00:22:43 It's not like I'm afraid to die.
00:22:44 I mean, there is that I am afraid to die of the Rona, but it's not like that's what I'm
00:22:50 thinking about.
00:22:51 I just think about death in general.
00:22:53 Recently?
00:22:54 Yeah.
00:22:55 How come?
00:22:56 What do you think?
00:22:57 Well, I mean, it's not like I never did before.
00:22:59 Yeah.
00:23:00 That seemed to be lurking under the surface of a lot of insane discussion.
00:23:04 It's just the sort of like, huh, I'm also scared of dying guys, lol.
00:23:07 You think so?
00:23:08 Yeah.
00:23:09 I feel like I've gotten that vibe from you before.
00:23:11 I'm super scared of dying.
00:23:14 I guess what could be worse?
00:23:16 Yeah.
00:23:17 I mean, true, but everyone is though, right?
00:23:22 It's not like that's unique to me.
00:23:24 It's not, it's not unique to you.
00:23:26 I don't know.
00:23:27 I have no frame of reference for exactly how much you think about it.
00:23:36 A whole bunch.
00:23:38 Yeah?
00:23:39 What do you, Ben, you die right now.
00:23:41 What do people say?
00:23:44 What do they say?
00:23:45 Yeah, what do they say?
00:23:46 Are they happy?
00:23:47 Are they sad?
00:23:48 I mean, I imagine they'd probably be more or less sad.
00:23:51 They would probably say, you know, at least you don't have to hear that guy talking about
00:23:56 communes on the PCP.
00:23:58 America will never be a socialist country.
00:24:01 Fuck that guy.
00:24:04 I don't know, they'll probably say that I was a guy who had, I don't know, I imagine
00:24:13 people would, I imagine people would miss me a little bit.
00:24:17 People would say that I could have realized more potential if I hadn't died early, you
00:24:24 know, normal shit.
00:24:29 So, you know, I guess, I guess that's all fine.
00:24:33 I would hope that like, I would hope that people would say like, boy, I sure was glad,
00:24:39 you know, Ben might be gone, but I sure am glad that he was around.
00:24:44 You know, I made a difference.
00:24:46 I'm better for having him had been here.
00:24:50 That's would be pretty good.
00:24:53 I think it's probably the most you can ask for out of anything.
00:24:56 It's just people being happy that you existed at some point.
00:25:00 Yeah, yeah.
00:25:02 Where's the cave entrance?
00:25:04 Where is it?
00:25:06 Here it is, epic.
00:25:09 I was going to say, oh, okay, this is kind of a left turn, but I was going back to like,
00:25:16 RFCK new people, and this is sort of one of the things I wanted to talk about.
00:25:20 So there's a weird sort of, I'm going to describe it.
00:25:26 I guess culture of, dude, the PCP sucks.
00:25:31 I hate the PCP, not as in like all of us individually, but like the show.
00:25:37 The show.
00:25:38 Yeah, yeah, especially in the RFCK audience.
00:25:41 And I feel like I've sort of like played into it in a way that maybe I shouldn't have.
00:25:46 Oh, definitely we have.
00:25:48 Yeah, we definitely have.
00:25:49 We talk all the times about how much we hate Nate heads and Digi heads.
00:25:53 Well, that's part of it.
00:25:55 I think, I mean, like a lot of people are like, well, no, yeah, that is part of it.
00:25:59 Yes, agree.
00:26:00 Period.
00:26:01 And it made me think about, if you remember, then all those times were recorded like old
00:26:09 RFCKs, like back like Atlanta bin RFCKs way back in the day.
00:26:14 And they would all be like prefaced and then like ended after we stopped recording with
00:26:21 like a big long like time of shit talking.
00:26:25 And in my life, since then, I do remember that I've continually like, you know, grappled
00:26:33 with the fact that I like, I am really unhappy with the fact.
00:26:37 And I find it like a very literally what is happening right now?
00:26:41 How do I get this to stop being what's happening right now?
00:26:43 I don't want this to be on screen right now.
00:26:46 I don't know what you're referring to the side box of all of these things.
00:26:53 Can you not see it?
00:26:54 Oh, okay.
00:26:55 Yeah.
00:26:56 Yeah.
00:26:57 The like recipe.
00:26:58 Yeah.
00:26:59 This is a nightmare.
00:27:00 I hate it.
00:27:01 But I grappled with the fact that I just I like gossip too much and it's a nightmare.
00:27:05 And I was wondering because it feels very like I feel like the PCP something about it as
00:27:12 like an institution attracts shit talking for like no real reason because I know there's
00:27:19 a lot of people who like it's like a joke, you know, it's a big joke in the RFCK community
00:27:23 how the PCP sucks.
00:27:24 But I get the sense from some people in there and in the PCP comments that like there's
00:27:30 something about the PCP that legitimately has attracted a lot of like scorn.
00:27:35 And I would almost say something to the effect of like betrayal in a strange sort of way.
00:27:39 There's a lot of like ire in some people's voices when they talk about something where
00:27:43 I can feel that too where there's sometimes where I feel like fucking PCP.
00:27:48 I feel so fucking betrayed for no reason and there's no real source of like why I should
00:27:53 feel that way.
00:27:54 But there's something about it that makes me feel so angry sometimes.
00:27:57 Do you ever feel that way where it's like there's no real reason to feel that way about
00:28:02 the PCP.
00:28:03 But do you ever feel like it's like do I ever feel scornful?
00:28:06 Yeah.
00:28:07 Yeah.
00:28:08 At like the PCP.
00:28:09 Yeah.
00:28:10 Constantly.
00:28:11 But like there's no reason.
00:28:12 Right.
00:28:13 I mean do you think.
00:28:14 I am.
00:28:15 I am like I'm going to make an embarrassing admission on here.
00:28:20 Right.
00:28:21 That's what RFCK is for.
00:28:22 So don't worry.
00:28:23 Sure.
00:28:24 I mean it's not about the PCP.
00:28:26 I mean about the PCP like I've been I've had reasons to be annoyed at it before but
00:28:31 like these days I'm like I'm like really preoccupied and I think all the time about how mad I am.
00:28:38 That Nate is like a shithead.
00:28:40 Yeah.
00:28:41 Like politically.
00:28:42 Like yes.
00:28:43 It's like it's like very much on my mind and like upsets me.
00:28:48 Like on a regular basis.
00:28:51 Do you ever.
00:28:52 I feel like we might have talked about this before but what like I think like the biggest
00:28:56 flaw of my like character as a human being is in the shower I will fake argue with people
00:29:03 that I know.
00:29:04 I will like I will I will have been thinking about something and then I will thank you.
00:29:08 Do you do like do you do like do you have you have the perfect comeback.
00:29:13 Yeah.
00:29:14 Well I have it's a combination of like oh my like it's either I was talking to someone
00:29:18 and they said something that I fucking thought was so stupid but I didn't have the words
00:29:21 for it at the time or like I'll have been thinking of something else and then I would
00:29:24 think this person would probably have this to say about this and it would be so fucking
00:29:28 stupid for them to think that because that's such a stupid thing to say and it's so
00:29:31 in character for them to say it.
00:29:32 I know.
00:29:33 Yeah.
00:29:34 Yeah.
00:29:35 Yeah.
00:29:36 Yeah.
00:29:37 I did it.
00:29:38 I know what you're talking about.
00:29:39 It's so like it's weird.
00:29:41 Okay.
00:29:42 My like friend circle.
00:29:43 You imagine you imagine like a sort of straw man who is making like this like a very like
00:29:50 obviously like an easily like counterable argue like argument.
00:29:54 Yeah.
00:29:55 Then you imagine like what you would say to that person to destroy to utterly just destroy
00:30:00 their ass with facts and logic.
00:30:02 Yeah.
00:30:03 Exactly.
00:30:04 And there's something about it that feels so like good.
00:30:06 I mean I guess it's obvious you know you feel good for being a smart person and this
00:30:10 is way for you role play being smart without actually having to be smart in the moment.
00:30:14 Hell yeah.
00:30:15 It's pretty epic.
00:30:17 There's something about it where it's like my piece of my like friend group right is the
00:30:22 PCP basically.
00:30:24 It expands a little bit beyond the PCP borders but it's basically the PCP and then fans of
00:30:29 PCP and so it feels like that sort of totem billion in your head of oh I fucking hate
00:30:36 this guy and oh I'm gonna talk about how shit the PCP is.
00:30:40 It feels like weird jockeying for power in like a weird sort of political way where it's
00:30:46 like it's fun to talk about the PCP being shit because in a way it shows that well I'm
00:30:52 the PCP but I'm talking about how shit it is so therefore I'm not the bad ones it's
00:30:57 other people.
00:30:58 Hey listen you should like me still no matter what right?
00:31:01 That's where I think it's probably like coming from the deep recesses of my psyche where it's
00:31:06 like I wanna like shift off blame for something that doesn't really matter like a podcast
00:31:11 going downhill in a nebulous way that doesn't really matter.
00:31:15 I don't really understand the line of thinking that like the podcast has gone downhill.
00:31:22 The podcast is as it ever was.
00:31:24 Yeah.
00:31:25 Some people are weirdly attached to the idea of topics and like I think that's dumb.
00:31:34 This is what every time this comes up this and this comes up like constantly and I constantly
00:31:38 have to repeat myself that the PCP is what it is and it will never be anything more and
00:31:43 like it is not the thing it is not it is for people who already know us and like know our
00:31:49 channel and know who we are and want to hear us talk but like nobody nobody's going to
00:31:53 like find us listen to the PCP and be like oh you know it's not discoverable it's for
00:32:00 people that already know us.
00:32:02 Right.
00:32:03 It's not like the cornerstone.
00:32:05 That like I have to these I don't feel this way about any other thing and maybe just because
00:32:10 I am a part of the PCP maybe it's because I like am you know closer to it than I am
00:32:17 any oh god I thought the problem is what it called me then I am any other like art piece
00:32:21 or like podcast or show anything like that.
00:32:23 There's something about it that it just feels very cathartic to want to try and like distance
00:32:30 myself from any responsibility of its you know quote unquote quality where it's like
00:32:35 you're right the PCP is always been just a thing for us to talk like there's never been
00:32:41 any greater ambition than us just talking.
00:32:43 You know like I think my version of that is like I would I would not like for people
00:32:52 I would not like for people to know me as the guy on the PCP I have like my own stuff that
00:32:59 would rather be known for so it's so it's it's I think that might be one reason why I'm
00:33:05 sometimes inclined to be like oh PCP's PCP sucks PCP's dumb I'm the only good one I'm
00:33:15 I'm different yeah if I were in charge things would be different around here.
00:33:20 Meanwhile it's like a collective collectivized group where any of us have the power to make
00:33:25 the change if we truly are dedicated to it and but like I get that where it's like you
00:33:29 know if I were to care the PCP then yaya yaya but like we're all kind of are the the PCP
00:33:35 if we really want something to happen then it would have happened yeah like I mean at the end
00:33:42 of the day like I probably am like like probably like behind maybe Nate I am probably like one
00:33:50 of the most powerful like driving forces of the of the PCP as an entity I'm like one of
00:33:58 the most involved which is kind of embarrassing yeah why is it embarrassing because like I
00:34:05 said like I mean I don't want to be nobody wants to be just the guy from that podcast you want to
00:34:12 be your own guy with your own identity which I mean I think I am but I'm but like there are
00:34:19 definitely people there are definitely some people I don't think they're a majority or
00:34:24 anything but there must be some people out there who only know me as one of the guys on the PCP
00:34:30 and probably the same with you same with like Tom hippo yeah probably even like Nate probably
00:34:36 probably like most people probably found us through found us through Digi so and then most
00:34:42 some people you know but you know what I mean like if any if there's anyone who doesn't know
00:34:48 your other stuff but does know the PCP to that person you are just some guy on a podcast and
00:34:56 that is the end that is the beginning and end of your existence do you think we take I agree with
00:35:03 the there but do you think that that's partly our fault for not having I mean I think it's
00:35:08 inevitable yeah like inevitably there will be people who are not familiar with Europe with you
00:35:14 outside of the show and it's okay it's not a big deal but you know the less the less it's the
00:35:22 case the better hence me oh fuck the PCP it's dumb yeah that's I that's just the thing I do but
00:35:31 like I actually it sucks you know but actually it's it's not good at all and I don't like at all
00:35:36 yeah that's right I don't know how to prep segue into this but there's something that I think I
00:35:41 appreciate about Digi a lot and it's the sort of thing where like Digi can like enrage me a lot
00:35:47 with the things that he says there's I really do feel like if there is if the chips are ever down
00:35:54 in a certain way then I feel like did you would probably support me do you like I yeah in most
00:36:04 in most cases I think that's probably true it's something I appreciate where it's like again we
00:36:10 were just talking about how like you know it's so easy to like exist in this backbiting sort of
00:36:15 gossipy scenario with the PCP I think because it's so small and there's like so like there's
00:36:22 personality on the line and it feels so pathetic because there's so little to be gained from like
00:36:27 you know shit talking where it's like at most you maneuver politically in such a way where you
00:36:32 have now secured some more fans for you that are more loyal to you than they would have been
00:36:36 otherwise because you have voiced concerns like that doesn't matter fucking at all you know it's
00:36:41 you know yeah like I'll say I'll say some I'll be pretty critical of like Nate or Digi and those
00:36:49 two in particular Lamal but you know it like at the end like I'll still fucking like you know I'm
00:36:55 like I have a pretty limited audience compared to those two so I don't have that much to offer but
00:36:59 at the end of it like I still fucking like retweet them when they like announce projects and stuff
00:37:03 and you know I like I want their endeavors to succeed and all that shit there's something so good
00:37:12 about like I don't know this this is sort of weird and I don't know if they'll agree with this but
00:37:18 there's something I've been really thinking about a lot about like blind loyalty where you will go
00:37:22 down with the ship if you're the captain or I guess if you're one of the crew members in the
00:37:27 scenario where it's like like it's so easy for me to want to like leave in a weird way but I would
00:37:35 never want to do that because like I don't know there's something about it where I want to stick
00:37:40 around even if it's a nightmare or you know as the people may be saying or you know the podcast
00:37:45 going down to Hill or something but like I feel like it's bad for me to always feel them the need
00:37:52 to gossip and be like fuck the PCP is so bad now where it's like there's no reason there's no
00:38:00 reason and I meant I like the guys that was completely incomprehensible point the point is
00:38:04 that I like all of the people and I shouldn't gossip with them so much because I just want to be
00:38:09 their friend and I don't want to do this anymore I don't like being a podcast person where I have
00:38:12 to jog jockey to be a roman senator um I don't you know for a while I think I saw like being on
00:38:22 the PCP as sort of my like venue for like being in the public eye I don't really feel that way
00:38:29 anymore I kind of just show up to the shit I mean you know I kind of just show up to episodes now
00:38:35 just because it's the thing to do and also because there's money but like I like even if there
00:38:41 weren't money I would probably just keep coming just because like I don't know it's tradition it's
00:38:48 just but I don't think I'm I don't I don't really feel like I need the like exposure it offers or
00:38:58 anything I don't I mean there is no exposure ever like everyone already knows you like the PCP is
00:39:02 not growing like you know it's just is like the same audience well I mean it's grown up it's it's
00:39:07 grown a little bit now it's grown more since the like animorphs lecture came out then like it had
00:39:13 in like months before that's cool then yeah pretty pretty good right pretty good right I there's
00:39:22 there's a while I was talking with DeVu for a while at like I don't I don't even remember why but
00:39:29 just like after he left out of the blue I think I just like linked up something and we started
00:39:33 talking and we had a few conversations about like the PCP and about how like shit it was and it was
00:39:39 kind of cool but and you know DeVu is one of the members who decided to leave like publicly and
00:39:46 that's the sort of you know I was thinking maybe maybe I want to do that just because again it's
00:39:51 the sort of thing where it feels like there it maybe I don't know if you feel this way there's
00:39:58 something about it where when the podcast doesn't go exactly your way or when something in the group
00:40:03 or one of the members acts a certain way that you don't condone there's something about that feels
00:40:08 very like oh I guess the only word I can come up with is betrayal like it feels like something has
00:40:14 changed and you don't like it and you feel like oh I was it should have been like this I should have
00:40:19 been the one or you know I should have been the main driver here I should have been able to lead
00:40:23 this I should things were better can you give me an example I'm trying to think I'm trying to think
00:40:28 like I guess it's just hmm okay this is a very small example this isn't really I guess the most
00:40:35 iconic or the best example of it but something about like I know it wasn't on the topics episode
00:40:40 but there is I know there I know I knew it was happening and I knew that I did you listen to it
00:40:47 I did not listen to it okay I talk a bunch of shit about you oh did you oh yeah okay
00:40:53 well I complain about you and I express confusion at you like so like never wanting to be on
00:41:00 episodes anymore um I mean do you want to talk about it you want to I mean we can if you want
00:41:05 but like not to interrupt your point or anything um oh I was like I like I knew Nate wanted well
00:41:12 I knew Nate would say what I think that he'd expressed before where it's like topics bring
00:41:18 you know structure and stuff like that and at rad con he specifically says something in the effect of
00:41:22 like like we were going to do a topic episode I think we were discussing doing the buster cast and
00:41:27 he was like you know we're doing topics episode and it at some point he said it feels like we
00:41:34 can't do those anymore like it feels as though because we haven't done something like that so
00:41:39 long it feels as though that's the sort of thing that we can't do and that's I was gonna come in
00:41:45 and I had notes and stuff and I was gonna be like ah but if you remember I wouldn't when we were
00:41:50 talking about doing topics list I said that we could do those whenever we wanted to and I was
00:41:55 gonna be a big pillar big pillar of it and if only I was here I was I would be able to drive in a
00:42:00 way where it's like yes we would be able to do those very frequently and very suddenly and you
00:42:04 know we would have more buster cast and stuff like that if I were the one leading the helm but I
00:42:10 wasn't and I'm doing it I'm not you know there's no one to blame it blames even the right word
00:42:16 for something like that other than myself that's the sort of thing where it's like I feel as though
00:42:20 it like you know if I were to do things would be different even though the only person stopping
00:42:27 me from doing yaya yada is myself and even if I did there would probably be no real meaningful
00:42:33 difference you want to talk about why I'm not on the show anymore oh if you want everyone said
00:42:39 like you just I think I think Kazi said the other day it's like you just like don't feel like coming
00:42:45 on which like I mean fair enough original like okay there's a few things going on in this in the
00:42:53 thing where this this this may you know given the conversation it may feel more like a like I like
00:43:01 I dislike the PCP than I do and that's sort of why I don't want to ever like leave in the same way
00:43:07 that any of the others in pursuit just because I think there's no point to that at all there's no
00:43:10 point in saying I am leaving the podcast you know hard line this is a capital T thing I'm doing
00:43:18 I'm not going to be on the PCP anymore no I agree yeah I would only consider doing something like
00:43:24 that if there was like a big like problem that it was like a big problem and something that I felt
00:43:30 I needed to make like a serious like statement about yeah and be like it I would only do it in
00:43:35 like protests of something yeah I agree with that but yeah there's just no point I mean you know I
00:43:41 just have not decided to be on episodes for a while and a few things one is I don't really like I
00:43:50 guess I just don't really like it he's the main thing and I and I mean that in both I don't like
00:43:56 being on the show but more so I don't like being a host on the PCP like that being a character
00:44:01 trade of me like you were saying earlier like this is what people think of me as and that sort of ties
00:44:06 in the fact I don't really want to be a YouTube personality and I know I wasn't really trying that
00:44:12 hard to be one you know I was not trying to game the algorithm before but even the limited like
00:44:16 exposure I had to that world of having to always be on and to do that sort of showmanship for like
00:44:24 you know a living really because you know we got money from it and it was a big part of my income
00:44:28 for a while I really didn't like it I really thought it was like a gay and like shit and fake
00:44:35 and so I didn't want to do it because I didn't like the way you have to or why do you have to be fake
00:44:41 um well hmm I don't mean that when I'm on the PCP like I do I do kind of um I do kind of like ramp
00:44:53 up the energy a little bit more than I might in like a casual conversation so I guess in
00:44:58 a way it's like a little fake that way but like I don't know I don't mean I'm my genuine self and I
00:45:04 express my genuine opinions about things the reason I said that is because I said gay before and I
00:45:09 wanted to do the fake and gay YouTube comment joke I don't actually it being fake is not a big
00:45:14 part of stupid stupid okay I I don't like a part okay a part of it is that like the PCP isn't the
00:45:26 sort of show I want to do because I've really gotten into I think through being in college and
00:45:34 just like kind of like I don't know talking to more people outside of the realm like I've really
00:45:38 gotten into my head that I really don't want to have the things that I make solely be like don't
00:45:46 you like munchy munch is cool right dude munchy right come come consume this piece of art which
00:45:52 is simply munchy is here for a little while because I think it's destined to become boring and
00:45:59 stupid after a while and I am I'm so I mean this is gonna sound pretty pretentious I think this whole
00:46:04 podcast probably will and I think that I'm probably becoming more and more pretentious by the day
00:46:09 and it's gay but I feel like I'm really concerned with like quality almost my detriment and sort of
00:46:16 downfall in a way where I get like what's what's the term for when you don't want to go out on
00:46:24 stage at the school talent show stage fright yeah yeah yeah stage fright I get stage fright a lot
00:46:30 now in a weird way that I hadn't before like whenever I like sit down to record something after
00:46:36 like taking a long break from the PCP and after not really doing a whole lot of stuff like this
00:46:41 before and after consuming a lot of like other podcasts and shows and still more things that
00:46:46 like I really enjoy but that like are very very very different from what the PCP is I sort of have
00:46:52 like a weird sort of anxiousness when I record in a weird bizarre sort of twisted way and so
00:46:59 that's part of the reason why I don't like being on I get that I get that with streaming I don't
00:47:06 really get that with the PCP I guess it's because like if I'm on the PCP I can like there's no
00:47:13 there's not that much pressure because like if I wanted to I couldn't just go silent and like
00:47:19 everyone else will just talk when I'm streaming or something especially if I'm by myself it's just
00:47:27 like I have to carry this yeah I have to like and if anyone like finds me annoying or boring like
00:47:34 it's all on me well I think it's precisely because of what we were talking about the shit talking
00:47:40 where it's like when I go on the PCP after having you know talked in the lunch table about how shit
00:47:49 the PCP is in about haha fuck those guys right and then I go on well then I better be a fucking good
00:47:55 edition that show right like I better be the savior at that point otherwise I've just you know I've
00:48:02 revealed myself to only be saying those things so that I can get one up on my opponents which
00:48:07 aren't my opponents they're just my friends but I feel the weird need to distance myself for the
00:48:13 aforementioned pride yeah so it's like it's part of that it's also that like I don't know I've got
00:48:20 I've gotten really autistic that was the scariest moment in my entire fucking life that's that's
00:48:30 what's like recording the PCP is that moment right there oh my god by the way the game's so
00:48:35 choppy by the way I don't know if you can tell how choppy it is it's really funny it feels
00:48:39 kind of recording I assume that was just screen share that was like no no that's the game it's
00:48:45 ever um it's gonna say something oh like I have I have like weird autistic ideas about how I would
00:48:53 like want a show to happen but I know that PCP will never be like that and not like the PCP is
00:48:58 shit and like it's bad it's just one of those things where it's like if I were at the helm yeah
00:49:02 I gotta again I'm I am at the helm indeed and things could be different if I put in the work
00:49:07 but it's like I don't want to because the PCP is not something I even want to do in concept as a
00:49:13 personality driven show which is something I'm not want to move away from so that's why I'm not
00:49:18 on the show anymore is because I don't like doing it because it makes me feel weird recording it and
00:49:22 I think it like sucks and I'm not good on it and I don't want to do shit that's bad yeah I don't
00:49:29 want to do shit it's bad and I am bad is the reasoning so there's no it just I just I don't I
00:49:39 don't really relate I mean yeah and you're on so yeah I mean there's no it'll like I don't think
00:49:48 like it's bad like I think I think I think part of what people may think is that like when you're
00:49:55 on the PCP it feels like you're showing up for like a paycheck which like could be true I mean I
00:50:00 think is true to a certain extent which I don't think there's any problem I mean it is part of my
00:50:04 motivation yeah which I don't think it's like a huge big deal and it's like like I don't blame
00:50:11 anyone for being on the PCP nor I think it's like a problem or like any issue and like again like
00:50:17 there's no like I don't think the show has gone downhill at the point where it's like embarrassing
00:50:21 or anything or even yeah whatever anyone says the show is at the show is at worse as the same as
00:50:29 it's ever been yeah it will I feel the same way so it's like I feel no sense of fuck the PCP I'm
00:50:37 like I'm not protesting by not being on I think it's basically just what I want to do is not the
00:50:43 PCP like I don't want to do it for all the reasons I was just describing but I wish no ill will
00:50:49 towards anyone on it or you specifically or you know is there a reason I have ill will towards you
00:50:56 though yeah now I know specifically specifically I'm typing I'm tweeting I'm tweeting the buster
00:51:05 cast you can't say this is gonna be my big break this is gonna be the my moment it is gonna be
00:51:10 the bus the buster cast is gonna break me into the spotlight it's you're gonna we're gonna get more
00:51:15 views in the in-morphs lecture we're gonna beat away every all the competition can be easy I can't
00:51:22 wait for Canton to take us over how genuine how how much do you think that Nate's actual goal
00:51:33 and maybe the Nate and Digi's actual goal with Canton is to just supplant the PCP but be in charge
00:51:40 now and own it well like again it like the I guess they already own the PCP to an extent
00:51:48 well just well we all own it all yeah we all own it that's what I'm saying is that like you know
00:51:55 them being in charge I don't know if that would make any meaningful difference also Digi was
00:52:00 definitely like like I don't know if he was joking and since he doesn't mean that he wants
00:52:06 Canton to be the new thing that people do but he does like the word takeover was just Digi being
00:52:11 autistic and not being able to communicate clearly ever but that's just part of him like he
00:52:15 definitely meant no malice or like the like the word takeover implies like a hostile like against
00:52:21 people's wills it implies like you know an army marching over a city like he doesn't mean like
00:52:25 that he just means that he hopes that Canton will be the new thing of the PCP is which is to say
00:52:32 shit low-level content that people just do so that they can make money and then make cool
00:52:38 art on the side and they it'll just be like a like an engine for funding their actual art is what
00:52:43 I imagine that he is saying by that um I don't know I don't see the appeal of it I don't really see
00:52:51 I don't really see it succeeding well the appeal of it is just that it is easy content to do and
00:52:58 then people will eat it up and they will give you money and then you can spend more time doing
00:53:03 the vapors because you won't have to do all the other jockeying they have to do it's for political
00:53:07 and social clout like screaming and why would it make more money than the PCP because I guess
00:53:14 they're more dedicated to it I guess they have more of a drive to do it I don't know why I don't
00:53:19 know why they think it would me either maybe well maybe because it's it's um it's art it's content
00:53:30 that is about popular shows whereas the PCP is just about us so it's it's automatically limited to
00:53:36 a slow trickle up burn of new viewers maybe they think that because it's you know more algorithm
00:53:44 me I guess it will have more success maybe that's the idea I guess I guess why do you feel such
00:53:55 an apprehension to the idea of canton being the new thing that is done because because what I would
00:54:04 imagine is that basically nothing would really change I would imagine they would they would like
00:54:08 I mean there's no reason why the PCP as a podcast could still exist but I think I mean I think you
00:54:14 I think you said earlier where it's like the PCP as a podcast doesn't need to exist in the sense
00:54:22 that it's like that's epic like we love recording the PCP podcast specifically it's just like a
00:54:26 means to an end of keeping everyone you know relevant and doing a weekly show and stuff like
00:54:31 that but if something can supplant that like a canton if there's like a weekly canton you know
00:54:37 what's what's the harm like what's the what's the problem well it is just feel weird that like
00:54:44 now digi and Nate are like actually the the head for real this is just feel strange yeah well I
00:54:49 think that's yeah if we can argue about whether it was like a genuine sentiment but like if the
00:54:57 content were to like become like basically the new PCP it would just be the same but Nate and
00:55:03 digi would be in charge of it they would just they would just control it and I don't know that
00:55:11 sucks it's yucky I'm trying to think I guess I do feel like it's it's yucky in the sense that I
00:55:20 would feel like like a coup almost but I definitely I really feel like if did you were here he would
00:55:26 be like arguing against this like I don't know the phrase you know I don't know he is the one
00:55:32 that said take over the PCP but I think I really think that he just can't communicate at all and
00:55:37 that's his problem and that when you get to explain things then it they sound less retired than
00:55:41 they did you might you might be right and did you would backpedal on that yeah I think Nate
00:55:48 genuinely just wants to do that but he over he already has like the admin bonus like he he does
00:55:54 all the real work for the PCP he does all the hard part which is making the show like happen
00:55:59 each week like I like he I'm sure he doesn't even he doesn't own it what would that change like I
00:56:04 guess he gets a bigger cut I guess I mean he would just be in charge of deciding like where the
00:56:09 money goes okay I guess he would just be able to reallocate that in ways he thinks are more
00:56:14 productive to making a business I guess and that may then become the expensive making good
00:56:20 quality podcast in as you this is a zombie I don't know I didn't I didn't think it that far
00:56:29 through I decided that I was mad and then I stopped there I will know I just like why that's I
00:56:35 don't want him to own it I don't want anyone to own it we should I like that we all own it it's all
00:56:40 of our thing I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe that's not what Canton is supposed to be but they
00:56:48 sure made it seem like that's what it's supposed to be is just like an all a PCP alternative that is
00:56:54 like in somebody other than it like they own instead of now which they don't okay well here I'm
00:57:03 gonna try and phrase it like I how I this is my best okay I'm gonna steel man did you I'm gonna
00:57:09 pretend to be digging steel man is argument I think that in his mind this is what's happening he is
00:57:14 going to make and really push Canton as a new money-making venture and it will get Maddash I
00:57:21 don't know how he's gonna do it but I think that this is his plan to make a maddash doing Canton
00:57:26 and so his idea is okay we will have this more successful I I would say almost more normie show
00:57:32 than the PCP because you know you can link it to anyone you can say hey you like so are online
00:57:36 here's a canton bet sort of online it's opposed to hey do you know like my little pony whether
00:57:40 these guys do the reviews yeah yeah yeah it'll be easier to link people it'll be bigger and more
00:57:44 normie so there'll be this bigger money-making show and then he thinks well why would anyone
00:57:48 want to do the PCP because no one really thinks it's the main thing that they do well they just
00:57:52 come over and do canton because it's way more successful and then everyone will be happy and
00:57:55 everyone will make a lot of money will be epic and it will be straight up so are you so you're
00:57:59 are you saying that the goal of canton is just to make like basically what like buster cast just
00:58:06 like highly specific pieces of like content discussing media well yeah that's what bust that's
00:58:13 what buster that's what I'm what's the name of the fucking show that was just canton that's
00:58:18 what canton already is on the channel I don't you think I fucking watch canton you think I know
00:58:24 what they do over there well if you were so concerned then why didn't you check oh I just know
00:58:31 I don't like it yeah they do like media reviews and stuff like that so so I guess I guess it's
00:58:39 just there it's just the same thing they do on their own channel but now there are two of them
00:58:43 and it's like a lower production so it's easier to create cool canton is it canton is a it's not
00:58:52 a good name it's not a good name for a channel it's not searchable I I don't like it because it
00:58:58 feels okay this is very pretentious again it feels like I don't like the idea of can't content I
00:59:02 don't like it just I wish I wish we all pretended what we did was art still even though we know
00:59:07 it's not I mean I I think that's supposed to be like the joke it's like hey you want like
00:59:13 mindless like you know disposable content here's some is lol but also like it just is yeah is
00:59:23 that yeah it's not like really a joke at all um but it's like self-aware about what it is at
00:59:31 least I guess I think that's the point of it that's fine I don't know if people want to make
00:59:37 people want to make you know that kind of stuff that's fine I mean I don't have anything against it I
00:59:43 just think the name is bad the name is not searchable and it's like an inside joke that like you
00:59:48 wouldn't get if you weren't already familiar with them um that did it I don't even know the
00:59:54 origin of the name did you just come up in some podcast on the side let's I think it's just how
00:59:58 did he says the word when he's being silly um but like you know I don't know it's not searchable
01:00:09 what I imagine is that they have to do how would you hear about canton and be like oh if I heard
01:00:15 that I would go and say oh C A N T E N T no okay give up they're gonna have to put all the variation
01:00:24 of spellings in the um the description and the tags so that no matter what they search they'll
01:00:30 get it now let's have to put in normal content too because some people will just hear the person
01:00:34 will just say that they think that they're saying content weirdly because it's funny which I guess
01:00:39 is the case yeah true um yeah name is not good but I don't know I think I mean as a weirdly sort
01:00:50 of outside perspective like I have no intention to do a canton especially to move to Virginia Beach
01:00:57 to do a canton for like a live-in that's not what I want to do never never never never never
01:01:03 never never never never never never but it seems like it seems like it just is the pcp2 and it
01:01:10 feels like what's the harm I guess other than the did you know what you say it feels like it's the
01:01:15 pcp2 what's the harm I say it's the if it's the pcp2 what's the point okay I'm just a skeleton
01:01:21 man oh I'm gonna die right now cool no dude I don't want to die dude I don't like that yeah I know
01:01:29 right it's real bummer it makes you makes you sad it does make me sad just makes me sad like you
01:01:40 know a hundred a hundred years hence it won't matter what happens it won't matter what I thought
01:01:47 about anything you know but at least I will have been mad at digi bro for a while yeah my standing
01:02:01 monument oh god yeah pretty much epic anyway the pcp2 like sucks dude like they don't even have
01:02:11 they don't even read for Urban Dictionary anymore that's true sad but true you hate to see it happen
01:02:19 you hate to not see Urban Dictionary either oh no I fucked up the tweet I fucked up the tweet how
01:02:27 the fuck could you convince yourself to make the pcb danielson how did that happen literally how
01:02:32 could that have happened I mean it's epic but like why like how could you have maintained sandy
01:02:39 while making it I mean I imagine that probably the guys making it just like like each other and like
01:02:47 had a good time working on it with each other I think that's probably what propelled it to be
01:02:52 finished mm-hmm it had it had to be that shit okay okay I was in production for like a year right
01:03:00 what like a year and a half yeah damn cray I got to go to the nether bra it's gonna be crazy how
01:03:11 are you already nethering because I play the game efficiently like a gamer that's awful
01:03:18 games are meant to be played poorly yeah that's right your speed running I'm a speed
01:03:26 running speed running is antithetical to the true gamer spirit well let's go build a house
01:03:31 been let's go build a nice nice little house I would have to are you in like a server could
01:03:38 I like jump in if I wanted no I I guess I could set one up but that would be a long time and it
01:03:44 would be stupid and take like a year to port forward a survey whatever I don't feel like
01:03:52 fucking playing Minecraft you know they have been playing what animal crossing your roommate
01:03:59 has a switch right yeah Caleb Caleb has a switch I jumped I jumped on his island I'm doing pretty
01:04:07 good I'm almost ready to upgrade my house I played New Leaf for a little while and I liked it so
01:04:13 I might want to get it I do have a switch I like got a switch for a smash played smash for like
01:04:18 two weeks and then like have never played anything else in my switch like since it was
01:04:23 pretty dangerous so I should I should probably get a game to play on my Nintendo switch for once
01:04:27 it's weird I like never played video games it was like a weird thing where as a kid I would game
01:04:33 nonstop and there was a big part of my dinner where it's like I like Nintendo games that's a
01:04:37 personality point put that on my Tinder profile I like Nintendo games and then for a long while
01:04:44 there like I did not interact with an interactive piece of software for like years like it like I
01:04:50 just basically never played I would occasionally boot up civ 5 play like around and then quit
01:04:54 no way through as a kid I wanted to be playing video games like constantly like all the time
01:05:00 and then like now I'm like I don't know all occasionally like distract myself with Pokemon
01:05:06 showdown or something yeah like very rarely do I'm like time for me to play a video game yeah
01:05:13 no I agree but quarantine has made me way like I've been playing video games like constantly
01:05:20 with Kazzie snap here Kazzie snap you want to cameo yeah but yeah what's going on I wasn't
01:05:26 listening we're playing video games yeah yeah I never played Minecraft maybe we should play
01:05:31 yeah okay well we'll play Minecraft after this no I just wanted you to say hi hi we're playing
01:05:42 through the Paper Mario's and it's epic you've played those before right yes well I've I played
01:05:49 didn't she like only play Super Paper Mario yeah that yeah that she only played Super and I had
01:05:56 played Super but only like half of that I did not finish it people hate on Super I think Super
01:06:02 is epic Super is like it's like yeah same like JRPG style that everyone loves about the other
01:06:10 ones no yeah awesome the Mario RPGs are like by far like the best RPGs because action commands are
01:06:18 just like they make the game like playable I mean I mean those are fine that's like a pretty minor
01:06:27 it's like a pretty minor point in the grand scheme of things what no so they're just like charming I
01:06:33 like love the mother games and like Mother 3 has a sort of action command system with music but like
01:06:39 I like cannot stomach play in RPGs where there aren't action commands I like I like hate them
01:06:45 viscerally I cannot play them for any longer than like a minute really yeah like I can't do it I
01:06:51 hate I hate I mean I grew up playing like Final Fantasy 7 and stuff a Final Fantasy 8 did kind of
01:06:58 have action commands a bit seven years awesome that's why Undertale is epic is because they have
01:07:04 like a weird battle system that's awesome no like no one like cares about that part of Undertale
01:07:12 that's like a shoot them up sort of weird dodging system but that's like the coolest part of
01:07:16 Undertale to me I only care about action commands and RPGs I mean you know it didn't invent the
01:07:24 idea well sure I mean obviously but I'm saying like it like if that's cool it's cool I like it cool
01:07:32 it kind of like fades into the background as the game goes on it does it doesn't really get
01:07:37 it's only at like certain like really like it's like boss battles that like you like remember
01:07:42 that it's a thing and are like invested in it you know well I guess that's fine because like it
01:07:49 mostly fades into the background unless it like suddenly becomes important and then it's you
01:07:55 notice it which is I guess is how a mechanic should work lol yeah good game it's a good video game
01:08:02 I thought you hated Toby Fox did I say that yeah I thought you like hated it and you thought that
01:08:07 you didn't deserve it it being anything um no when did I ever say that I'm pretty sure that I mean
01:08:15 I do I do think Undertale is overrated but like that's not to say that it's not good like it's
01:08:22 it would be hard to not be overrated when you're as appreciated as Undertale is right although have
01:08:31 we have we like come around on that has like has culture sort of like swung has the pendulum
01:08:37 swung the other way and like people are kind of like lost enthusiasm for Undertale now I think
01:08:44 it like Undertale has become one of the things where it's like it's so me meified where it's like
01:08:48 people think about like dude Law of Sands more than they think about like the actual game yeah yeah
01:08:55 sure so so in that way they probably don't really like Undertale but do people not but people
01:09:01 not think it's as good as they used to hmm but do they just not care about the actual product
01:09:08 itself I think mine just not actually care about the project itself I think I think people like
01:09:13 don't think about Undertale anymore they think about like Sands are people still um I don't know
01:09:22 is is Delta Room like still relevant they're like people make like Yaoi fan art of Delta Room
01:09:28 but that's basically it like Delta Room was Delta Room was just like like a like a a defibrillator
01:09:36 for the Undertale porn community that's that's all it was a stimulus package yeah hmm oh man I
01:09:45 have been having a lot of fun recently trying to like fill out forms and like obtain facts pertaining
01:09:55 to how I can squeeze as much money out of the government as I possibly can you know what I mean
01:10:00 no I know exactly I mean you and Tom have been going crazy in the PCP chat I mean I've been doing
01:10:05 a lot more of it then like I did talk to him and like explain to him like all the stuff that I had
01:10:09 found and like possible possible venues for that kind of thing but like you know I've been like
01:10:16 checking like websites and stuff like waiting for updates to try and be okay like when do I make my
01:10:21 move it's great it seemed for a while like I might be able to just get ten thousand dollars for
01:10:31 nothing I don't think I don't think that's gonna work out I might get something for being like a
01:10:35 sole proprietor of what might loosely be described as a business I might be able to get
01:10:40 something for that just as like a forward that doesn't need to be paid back which would be so
01:10:44 fucking cool I might be able to get us like a loan that I would not have to pay back provided I
01:10:50 spent it on like it's fun I would have to spend it on like rent mortgage and payroll but like by
01:10:58 payroll I could literally just give myself the money and call that payroll yeah it just be like
01:11:05 yep I paid myself with it it's forgivable now so you know trying trying to maximize all that it's
01:11:13 it's fun it's actually like kind of a an engaging puzzle that is exciting because of like you know
01:11:20 material benefit that I stand to obtain by like doing a good job at it do I love material benefit
01:11:27 I do don't you would you not love material benefit I certainly do I do quite like material
01:11:33 benefit it's good you know all things considered you know one's material circumstances are I would
01:11:40 say fairly relevant well I wouldn't go that far I don't know if you would have thought of this as
01:11:48 a person but I always wondered how like people and like did you who are like way more like you
01:11:53 know I guess big time fuck you small fry do an air net you know stuff like what do you have
01:12:01 planned for like when you're like too old to make poobah videos or not poobah but poobah
01:12:07 videos how what do you plan to do like are you gonna like die like how's retirement gonna look like
01:12:12 gonna like die well I guess I guess the plan is like maybe publish books and like maybe just like
01:12:28 try and live off royalties in the future like I don't have any like I don't have any books in
01:12:33 like stores right now that are so I like I would need to like I think I think like cheese like
01:12:39 memoirs I didn't realize comic books like like oh like my life been the alternative my my
01:12:45 alternative life by been saying shut up no no I mean just like get shit printed and try and live
01:12:53 off royalties from silly you know just get published through a distributor is like I think
01:13:00 that's the long-term goal in terms of like how to actually make money from from like comics I don't
01:13:06 know if I have enough that would be like publishable in that way right now I don't know if it would
01:13:11 make any money but like the hope is that maybe someday it could the I mean I could do other
01:13:20 things like I've talked here and there about how like one thing that I'd be really interested in
01:13:25 getting a like sort of a real job doing is doing like doing like art for like an indie game studio
01:13:33 or something every every now and then I like look on like local Craigslist or something for like
01:13:41 hey anyone like any like fucking dev studios like looking for an artist or anything like how serious
01:13:49 are the looks it's always it's always how serious are the looks would you describe yourself as pounding
01:13:54 the pavement in any way I mean in a purely digital sense perhaps so your dad wouldn't prove no
01:14:03 no you're taking a lot that so I don't know I guess that's the plan that'd be cool been saying
01:14:15 in it like indie game pixel artist I guess it's a great I think I could do it it's a great question
01:14:25 because yeah like I guess I don't know how I plan to like make money when I'm like old or whatever
01:14:33 it's weird since I don't have like since I don't since I don't have like a real job I don't well I
01:14:43 mean I guess I do pay into Social Security like with my like self-employment taxes and I guess that
01:14:49 I yeah so I guess I would be have something like a pension in the future I mean I'm saving up I'm
01:14:59 saving money in like a Fidelity account I have like a fucking I have a I have a small like 401k
01:15:05 or no a Roth IRA I have a small Roth IRA Raphael from the new teenage mutant ninja yeah that's
01:15:13 right he's really small he's not that big and a really big Michael and I don't know but you don't
01:15:21 get like if you don't have a real job you don't get like a pension or anything but like on the other
01:15:25 hand in the these days of the gig economy it's not like there's any guarantee that your employer
01:15:31 won't just like screw you over and fire you for no reason at any given time anyway I don't feel
01:15:36 like that's something that I would necessarily have anyway if I had just like you know gotten a real
01:15:43 job instead of doing internet shit so that that's sort of like it's weird like my I don't know I don't
01:15:49 think a generational thing I don't know if it's like a new phenomenon but like the idea of like job
01:15:54 benefits never really like occurred to me as like a consideration until like a couple years ago
01:16:00 like it was never like you know I want to get a job with good benefits like that was never even like
01:16:06 I don't think I even knew what it was until like I don't like five years ago or something like it was
01:16:11 never I guess was like oh like high salary right like you want a high monthly salary that's what you
01:16:15 wish they aim for right but like I mean you do well sure yeah here in America you also want your
01:16:21 fucking you want to make sure that your boss decides to promise you that you'll have like health
01:16:26 insurance and dental and stuff and then like a like a retirement and then and then they'll probably
01:16:31 take it away later on yeah you know they don't they're not really obligated to do anything that
01:16:35 they said they would do which is good that is that is actually good because that's the free market
01:16:41 and the free market is good yeah what were you talking about how you're gonna not die when you're
01:16:51 old and you're trying to make the vapors but you have the child's sold shaky hand and you can't do
01:16:57 it I'm a downward spiral yeah I know you're gonna be down a little down health trajectory
01:17:15 pair paradoxes 9-11 to your new Charles Schultz to it's gonna be even worse than anyone could have
01:17:20 imagined we only needed one Charles Schultz just has not been up for the two of us I bet Charles
01:17:32 Schultz doesn't have his shit the fucking a millionaire picnic he doesn't know shit he's
01:17:37 no shit about shit no he's fucking dead dude yeah he's fucking he fucking died so that makes
01:17:44 him on his tombstone at least I hate did you bro for a little while I sort of feel like being
01:17:56 cooped up in my in my room here just kind of having to deal with the fact that I look at a
01:18:02 screen all day I think there's something that's been fried in my brain because I just am constantly
01:18:07 like mad or sad always like I'm like that's just the soul like emotion that I feel as a human
01:18:15 being is I'm like yeah no definitely no I definitely agree that's absolutely the case for me I you
01:18:23 know you would think you would think that it would be like I'd have time to like work on stuff but
01:18:29 like I haven't been working on stuff like I have a little bit but like I wouldn't say the quarantine
01:18:35 definitely not made me more productive I find it like really hard to focus nowadays I would say
01:18:42 it's made me more productive I feel like somewhat happy that I'm able to like I don't know it like
01:18:48 it's two sides of the same coin where it's like I really hate the fact I can't go outside and it's
01:18:52 like it really feels like really terrible and like like my mind is melting but also like I'm
01:18:57 forced to feel like it's sort of an excuse yeah there's nothing more magical than that feeling
01:19:10 when you start a new thing or just you know whenever when a fascination fascination just
01:19:15 catches you and you just spend all night working on something because you just want to do it so
01:19:20 fucking badly there's nothing better than that and I've been I've been getting a few of those
01:19:23 lately with them with stuff relating to in those words birthday which is today we said at the
01:19:28 beginning but we didn't really talk about it since this was birthday haha click the link and donate
01:19:31 to our Kickstarter so you can buy pens oh yeah today today's the day today will be the day that the
01:19:37 Kickstarter goes live yeah that's exciting that's very exciting we just kind of like did it it's
01:19:43 kind of just like made it happen I've been thinking about it for a long time I know you know when
01:19:49 you said like oh we're gonna do I don't remember who I don't know it was me I well the thing is
01:19:56 is I just I was like we should do some sort of fundraiser I don't know what it was yeah because
01:20:01 people donated money on the last birthday you're like we should do like a fundraiser yeah it was
01:20:05 like okay but like what would it be the fundraiser for making pins like yeah we could do that but I
01:20:11 think it would be more successful as a Kickstarter yeah so yeah you know you will also be able to
01:20:20 buy more merch which you haven't even seen all the merch I've made you can get a mega slime shirt a
01:20:25 slime skull shirt a slime heart shirt a slime splatter shirt and reduxes of the two gang pride
01:20:31 shirts so go buy those if you don't want to donate to the pins for whatever reason but you really
01:20:35 want to give us money specifically because we aren't making that much profit on the pins it's
01:20:39 epic we gotta like we gotta fix the storefronts oh yeah no they're gonna be consolidated no yeah I
01:20:47 don't know why they were separated into three different things I mean I did it I did it like
01:20:52 that I thought it would be thematic but like actually it's just a night there's too many items
01:20:56 okay there's like I wish I wish you could set it up so you could like go to the storefront and
01:21:02 like just sort by like design like sort by tag or something and maybe you could maybe you could
01:21:09 just like tag like show me all rowdy merch like show me all killer merch show me all slime
01:21:13 court merch you know yeah I don't think you can do that it sucks um it's pretty bad I like hate
01:21:22 teespring I like a hate they're like editor it's like so fucking bad it's not it's not great
01:21:29 especially for the all over print yeah I did make I did make the um the like the neck gator the
01:21:38 face cover that's my like my like slime teeth on it that is epic I think that's pretty epic I
01:21:46 actually really am looking forward to that getting here are you the one purchase that by the way
01:21:52 of course I am yeah okay good yeah I bought it for um yeah I did the thing like it's like
01:21:59 buy a sample and it charges you like the minimum price that doesn't make any profit yeah epic yeah
01:22:05 hell yeah I'm gonna go to the nether guys it's gonna be epic level 17 let's go boys
01:22:11 dude I cannot believe how much money we got for madcon 4 I cannot believe it 34 thousand
01:22:23 dollars yeah it's pretty wild yeah I never would have suspected it I didn't think we'd hit 20k
01:22:30 no not at all I was afraid that we would like I don't know it would be just I guess I feel like
01:22:37 I'm in like a worry-a-worry with these sorts of things I was afraid I think you are you always you
01:22:42 you don't you didn't seem to think that the pins would make a lot of me I think the pins will make
01:22:47 here's my prediction I suspect that the pin I'll be embarrassed if I'm wrong what are you gonna do
01:22:53 my prediction is that the pink starter will make at least three thousand dollars I here's my prediction
01:23:00 I think it will get in the ballpark between 800 and 15 thousand dollars or not 15 thousand 1500
01:23:10 I think there's no way that it does not crack a thousand I think I think you're probably right
01:23:16 I feel extremely confident it'll be it'll break two thousand I know I would say pretty good chance
01:23:23 of 3000 well okay as long as it's not embarrassing then that's fine it's just as long as it's not
01:23:32 like we make two dollars and also we're robbed no there were people in my like birthday stream
01:23:38 yesterday that were like Bevan was like no pins are stupid but everyone else was like no I love
01:23:45 fans pins are like probably one of the coolest things that a person can have I hadn't even
01:23:53 considered making patches but you know thinking about it I would definitely put like patches on
01:23:59 stuff dude on my jacket like a rowdy pin that would be sorry a rowdy patch that would be like
01:24:05 awesome I could be like Scott Pilgrim and you know how he was like the X-men hoodie and it looks
01:24:09 really cool I could be like that but it would be like a rowdy thing yeah yeah uh we should um I
01:24:18 was saying like um when we when we run the polls for like what should we make next I guess I guess
01:24:24 there'd be like here like this pin that pin the other pin this patch that patch the other patch
01:24:31 yeah and they because pins the pins and patches we could make for like basically the same
01:24:36 amount so if they could just like be basically interchangeable with each other right I was oh
01:24:41 do you think okay do you think it's worth like kind of changing the verbiage on the like um
01:24:48 on the um the Kickstarter to be like the reward is not one pin the reward is like one slime credit
01:24:57 and you can like trade in a slime credit for a pin or a patch or like two for a challenge coin
01:25:05 like you get like money I think it's pretty fucking weird to confuse I mean we could easily do the
01:25:10 idea of if you want instead of having one pin you can save this pen design and you can just
01:25:16 with two pen designs saved up with two stretch goals if we do if we do the challenge coin I think
01:25:21 that's how we should do it yeah that's the only thing I think wouldn't just cost one I guess the
01:25:27 only thing is that like um if you want a patch but like the the reward is a pin and it's like okay
01:25:34 we have to say like okay like one patch equals one pin we could call it we could call the reward one
01:25:39 pin slash patch or something or but like what if we don't end up making any patches like what if
01:25:44 they just don't end up being like very widely voted for yeah we might not actually make any yeah um
01:25:50 I mean it doesn't matter I just thought like hey what if it was like a like slime corp like currency
01:25:57 scam I don't know your specialty Ben is coming in with like the absolutely like most autistic
01:26:04 minute changes in graphic design and spending five weeks doing it and it's awesome thank you
01:26:12 yeah pleasure happy to be of service it's awesome I'm glad I offer something
01:26:18 I really really bring a son to the table on that one
01:26:23 man we finally did the buster cast and nobody nobody showed up Nate who was like I can't believe
01:26:31 Nate didn't want to show up it's so strange to me it's me yeah Nate was like uh I don't know if I
01:26:35 could find the time did you was like uh I don't have the time it was like you don't have like
01:26:40 six hours in two days I don't understand this like weak shit of like oh yeah I just didn't have
01:26:47 time you know they've made I know has seen it multiple times he could have probably just shown
01:26:52 up without even watching it ahead of time I have no idea why I almost feel like it was some sort of
01:26:58 weird like making a point kind of thing what like they didn't want to be on it because like he said
01:27:05 we weren't going to do it unless he like uh I don't know I could be totally off base but like
01:27:11 what if Nate didn't want to be on it because he said we weren't going to be able to
01:27:14 organize it without him and then we did I don't know that might be wrong he said that you wouldn't
01:27:20 be able to organize it without him he said on the bonus episode that like guys you know you won't
01:27:25 do it if I don't like set it up what that's yeah okay and I was like no I'll just say when we do it
01:27:33 and then we do it and then I did that and then we did LeMau I don't know but I do not know I do
01:27:40 understand why they thought it would be so difficult to come on considering I know that I know they're
01:27:47 both fans but whatever that's fine just me and Tom just me and Tom just having a little me and Tom
01:27:53 solo double double solo duet cast you know it's new it's a new new character dynamic
01:28:00 chemistry my little pony it's it's like that's that's such a weird dynamic it's like apple jack and
01:28:07 yeah it's like apple jack and twilight like what do they even talk about yeah you're apple jack
01:28:12 could they fuck like I don't know let's find out if the answer yes but you'll have to buy the episode
01:28:18 so you can see all that steamy episode action ah you gotta buy the uncensored version to take the
01:28:24 like light beams oh god like they're like utter they're like down below the legs like utter tits
01:28:31 disgusting yeah I I I can't wait till the OVA comes out it's gonna be awesome
01:28:39 it is gonna be awesome but um we haven't like I feel like we have we haven't really made any
01:28:46 progress on finding an animator uh yes we have I don't know if we want to talk about it but hippo
01:28:51 has made progress he's he's been talking about in chat um I'm shit I haven't I must have missed it
01:28:58 yeah we're getting like yeah yeah I mean do you want to keep a secret or something because uh
01:29:05 well well I'll say in a very vague way that it implies nothing specifically but as everyone in
01:29:10 the audience knows hippo is you know working with like a studio so I don't think that they're gonna
01:29:15 do it but I he knows of people who could ask other people and he and that has been what has happened
01:29:20 as he has asked other people and have they and have they given him leads yes interesting
01:29:28 interesting but who knows if that's what how it will be or not but that's that's where we are
01:29:32 right now there there is there there there are things happening on that front that's good I'm glad
01:29:38 Ben you got so mad I have no fucking clue why I have no idea I don't really know exactly why either
01:29:49 I I think I just could hear I just I could hear in people's voices that they were like prioritizing
01:29:58 something that I thought was like be up beside the point and it really frustrated me and maybe
01:30:04 that's like stupid but that's how I felt you see here's the biggest problem with PCP is that we have
01:30:11 Nate you know uh what's his uh he has like self-defined no low-information voter and it's epic
01:30:17 and funny but max charisma can get anyone to like agree with him because he says things in such a
01:30:22 great way that everyone wants to agree with him because he says it in a great way and then Ben
01:30:27 you try to come on with the with the facts and the logics we have like an anti-charisma that
01:30:32 makes everyone hate you and it's infuriating that you always lose when you shouldn't lose
01:30:37 this thanks no well I didn't mean as in you're retarded I mean that you like you should by all
01:30:49 accounts you've done the reading you've done you know you you're on bread tube like you know
01:30:55 shit but there's just something about like people are just more excited to hear about like
01:31:00 something that sounds right more than something that is right you know do you want me by that
01:31:06 are we still talking about the animator or no no we're not talking about that at all no
01:31:10 no I'm talking about I'm talking about political things on the PCP um see I don't know if I agree
01:31:16 with that uh Nate Nate is not Nate's not convincing like I don't think anyone has been
01:31:21 like convinced of anything by Nate like saying he believes it capitalism just sounds so right though
01:31:29 it's sad it's not it doesn't I think I think a big okay I think a big big draw in the appeal
01:31:38 of capitalism is that it sounds so like something about that feels so like well it's just human
01:31:45 nature it's just human nature to want things and so why wouldn't we allow the obvious scenario to
01:31:50 allow a system where people who want things to remind their own self-interest to acquire them
01:31:56 like that sounds like so like oh of course of course of course I know well I don't know
01:32:02 I don't know if I agree with you that it sounds like obviously true I think the appeal of it
01:32:08 is that if true it require it means that like no action is required and like everything is by
01:32:15 default working as it should and like we definitely don't have to think about it anymore
01:32:22 I think that's the appeal of it
01:32:26 um no I think a lot of like I think oh okay I think this is true of literally everyone like
01:32:31 on on both sides but I think that like everyone wants like everyone like thinks that their side
01:32:36 sounds the most reasonable like and like it's almost obvious in a way which I it thinks makes
01:32:40 sense and I think a big part of what people cherish in these words debates is like when someone is
01:32:46 able to explain something in such a way where I think there's like a socialist term for this but
01:32:51 it's like it makes it seem where it's the only option not so that it's like the best option but
01:32:57 it's like to do something else other than our system that we have currently it would be like
01:33:02 against human nature it would it would be like this is so obviously the case this is so what
01:33:07 has to happen there's nothing else even like possible yeah I think that's a big like a draw
01:33:14 there I don't know draws like that's like the biggest thing I feel like you I feel like you've
01:33:17 missed you've missed the point like you you think that because you've been told it like your whole
01:33:23 life it's same with everyone like everyone's just been told that over and over again and now it just
01:33:29 feels true um because everybody's heard it well maybe that is what I mean that like like I'm saying
01:33:36 that it sounds so correct because we've been told yeah it's not it's yeah it sounds right
01:33:42 because everyone has been told it their whole lives like that's all I'm saying they've learned to
01:33:46 repeat it as a mantra yeah yeah sure yeah I mean that's that's definitely the case yeah and it's a
01:33:54 big problem uh that is uh ruining everything and it makes and it's you know when Nate like
01:34:02 think when Nate thinks he wins an argument because he says the thing that like is like
01:34:08 dogmatically accepted but by everyone by default because it's just that thing you say it's just
01:34:14 that cliche that everyone repeats over and over again it's just like a platitude but everyone
01:34:19 just accepts that it's true so if you you say it usually you automatically win because you said
01:34:24 the thing that everyone know quote unquote knows is true that even you don't even have to think about
01:34:30 it um it's amazing feels great what are we talking about uh I don't know I don't think we're
01:34:39 talking about I think we're talking about that and be stopped because there's nothing else to say
01:34:43 yeah that's all I have to say about that I'm in the nether been it's amazing
01:34:49 is it it's I couldn't have asked for anything better great I think you ever could have dreamed
01:34:54 why why are you in the nether what are you doing here why why are you playing the game stop it
01:34:58 why why why why why no no no man uh I'm going to go get blaze rods so that we can go fight the
01:35:07 nether dragon the nether dragon the dragon man we can go fight strawberry milk I'm not gonna go
01:35:12 fight I'm not gonna fight the nether dragon you're not gonna help me you're not gonna you're on your
01:35:16 own oh sad you stupid idiot well I guess it's just not in your self interest to do such a thing
01:35:22 no definitely not it's the human nature doesn't allow for such a such an action
01:35:28 no we tried the nether dragon before and you know I mean look at china
01:35:33 look at venezuela 100 million dead you criticize capitalism yet yet you exist I love that political
01:35:41 comment I don't know did we just did we just do exactly what we were talking about before did we
01:35:47 just say an unreasonable interpretation of nate's argument we probably did he probably like no
01:35:56 no I I like stopped listening to the podcast a while ago so I don't know how like the things
01:36:02 have changed so I'm like and that was like a while ago I think at this point like like
01:36:05 I think like half a year ago at minimum so I don't know if that's like people have gotten like
01:36:10 uh buff intellectually oh my god what the fuck is this that's terrifying um
01:36:18 you know and people are now have the maximum intellect they've read all the theory in the
01:36:22 entire world and now it's like a battle of undisputed masters of their opinion but last I
01:36:28 checked it was just kind of like you know what we were just describing so I'm going off of that
01:36:35 but maybe maybe things are better now I mean are they maybe now no everyone everyone always
01:36:41 on the last episode everyone was like oh I saw this was just like a ben and nate episode so I clicked
01:36:47 like oh thanks for the comments for letting me know not to watch this one
01:36:51 um everybody hates it everybody hates the punch then why do you do it then why do you
01:36:57 talk about politics because it's mostly you and me um I just have to I just can't I just can't
01:37:05 let people be wrong what like we define have to like who's like I guess it's it's you hate the fact
01:37:12 that this is being spread so you would be it would be immoral of me not to correct wrong things
01:37:19 that's it but if people hate it then then what what if you were to correct
01:37:26 their problem that's their problem isn't it your problem because your entire
01:37:30 line your entire but like you're all the success of this podcast rests upon public opinion
01:37:36 um
01:37:40 I guess well what do you want me to do uh I don't know if I want you to do anything but I'm saying
01:37:46 if if people are like commenting on every episode being like this is gay I hate this die and then
01:37:52 maybe you should be like oh well maybe I shouldn't do that anymore well I mean I'll I'll stop I'll stop
01:37:59 I'll stop bringing it up when other people stop making bad faith arguments against me
01:38:05 done they'll never happen because I know right that's right but that but that's what it's gonna take
01:38:14 and if people want to not hear about it anymore then we should all just agree
01:38:20 that I'm right yeah that I am correct and then and then there will be no more need for debate
01:38:26 epic yeah um we were talking about on the my birthday stream we were talking about
01:38:33 someone was like hey Ben you should debate destiny hey Ben you should debate destiny I was like
01:38:37 I'm not good I'm not actually I don't actually think I'm good at debating yeah like I couldn't
01:38:43 even I couldn't even really like claim like victory in the debate against digi and digi is
01:38:50 definitely not a good debater so like I must not be great either no um I also think I mean I don't
01:38:57 know I mean I I know this isn't what anyone really means but I still am like I have that sort of
01:39:06 repulsion the idea of winning a debate even though I know it's practical I know what everyone
01:39:11 means by it but there's something about it still makes me feel you know yeah I mean it's all very
01:39:17 performative yeah and very like uh you know you just do it for that you do it to win the
01:39:22 cloud or whatever oh you won you you you you you perform strength in front of people they saw
01:39:28 you win and their your reputation points go up or whatever I I feel like like digi like
01:39:36 most the time what he says is not stupid like did you just always needs an extra video to like
01:39:45 respond to comments because I feel like this is the way it always goes with the digi digi says
01:39:49 something which you have to be like a hardcore digi head to like understand what he means and
01:39:55 it will always be misinterpreted and then once everyone is like that's obviously retarded then
01:40:00 digi will say what he actually means because he understands how to respond and like why people
01:40:05 are misunderstanding and in that case it's always just he should just say what he actually
01:40:09 means in the first place then he should but he doesn't know how to he doesn't know he doesn't
01:40:13 get it he doesn't know I mean I think I think he would agree with what I'm saying or I think that
01:40:18 he would agree no I agree that is generally how things go a lot of the time I think digi most
01:40:24 the time says things are very reasonable he just needs an extra well when he yeah yeah most most
01:40:32 of the time upon further explanation you go oh okay oh it's not yeah yeah yeah and that's always
01:40:40 been a thing about him I that this is a bit as a whole entire life quest isn't it that he wants to
01:40:44 be understood yeah he says so and why should we doubt him I don't know maybe we should maybe we
01:40:53 shouldn't maybe it's true who's to say though in this doggy dog world we'll never we'll never know
01:41:01 we have we do we can only speculate this is oh Jesus Christ
01:41:11 oh oh oh oh hey man how's the nettle treating you it's hot a hot are you gonna you're gonna
01:41:19 beat the ender dragon uh yeah I think I can this minecraft's not that long wait really yeah right
01:41:25 if I find some blaze rods and I beat some enderman then yeah why not how how long do you think it'll
01:41:31 take you to beat the ender dragon or the never dragon well we'll see real boss ender ender
01:41:37 well it's hard to say right because it's all random so feel you know I could get a really
01:41:40 lucky spot where the stronghold is really close to me and in which it probably wouldn't take that
01:41:44 much long at all but like you know I could get one where it's very very very far away from me so
01:41:48 it might take a long time all right okay I guess we'll see I guess we will see
01:41:55 um I want to get anything God I yeah so you you asked me if I was gonna have the um
01:42:03 the the the slime and punishment finale done for the birthday yeah I said maybe and the
01:42:09 truth about that is that I definitely could have had it done um but I didn't I just didn't do it and
01:42:17 I mean part of that is because like I have I have basically I just like stopped communicating with
01:42:23 like a couple of people who were going to be like providing stuff for it um like as in their lost
01:42:30 causes oh no they're not lost causes I just like stopped oh it's a new thing it's a okay it's a
01:42:38 it's a new thing it's a new thing I mean well Sixten was gonna make the song but like I didn't
01:42:44 really vibe with the first song he made and he was like okay well if you want me to rewrite it
01:42:49 I'd like to see like a storyboard and I'm like I don't really have a storyboard I kind of just
01:42:53 have to like make the video so I'll just do that because you've made it like a shitty version of
01:43:00 of like just like a quick version so he would have known yeah I guess like I guess I could like
01:43:06 sketch it out yeah that's what that's what a storyboard is Ben I know I know I know well like
01:43:11 I could sketch out what I think it'll look like um I it might not end up looking exactly that way
01:43:19 but I guess that's probably fine yeah yeah I don't know I feel like maybe I didn't like
01:43:27 communicate exactly what I wanted to him and so when he turned to his song and it wasn't exactly
01:43:33 what I had like imagined and so I was like oh what do I do oh god I can't deal with this
01:43:42 I can't deal with my free labor not being completely exact I'm paying him for it oh well
01:43:47 never mind that fuck that guy yeah um I've been um I've been paying everyone it feels good
01:43:55 it is I gave um I gave I paid um a oblivion fall something for like helping me do the audio on the
01:44:05 JDR lecture I paid um shout out some money for like an animation for the something for the
01:44:13 Chris Chan lecture that I'm planning on using um I'm gonna pay six and for making the track
01:44:20 um I offered to pay um to Munich for a thing that she was making for the finale she said like
01:44:29 she didn't want it I don't know uh we'll see we'll see about that just pissed myself um why
01:44:38 just I was hit in the video game
01:44:41 no no that sucks too I was damaged once
01:44:46 bomber um anyway I don't know I made a bunch since I made all this money from the first kick
01:44:54 starter from the very very first two kickstarter I feel like it would I feel like it would be
01:44:57 unacceptable for me to like ask people to make me stuff just as a favor like even if it's not
01:45:03 something I'm selling I don't know yeah I can't just be like hey make me a song for a video you
01:45:09 know for free we're all we're all in this together we're all just pals um but I'm the one who benefits
01:45:17 yeah no no no no um we I kind of like the fact that we're doing like well I mean I really like
01:45:26 the fact that we're doing the kickstart the way that it is I like the fact that R2K is like a
01:45:30 really fucking weird like experimental like community driven consensus nightmare where it's like
01:45:38 everything is only real when the community says it is and we're running the kickstart like that
01:45:42 like this yeah I got I mean I would be a little I would be a little annoyed if like
01:45:50 everyone votes for like some dumb shit you know which I I think there might be like a couple
01:45:58 there might be some like dumb shit that ends up getting made as if it's only a little bit I won't
01:46:04 be too annoyed if it's like a lot of dumb shit I will like grumble about it like this is a waste
01:46:11 well why is it a waste if that's what they want well okay but if there's like okay I like can't do
01:46:20 this imagine we have like a imagine we have a hundred people that are like donating right we
01:46:26 have a hundred people that are buying pins and like we do a vote and like you know a whole bunch
01:46:31 of them vote for like something stupid they might vote for it and it might get passed but like
01:46:39 what what if what if they all like vote for it because it's funny but they don't actually want it
01:46:44 only maybe like five of them actually want like the funny meme design yeah so then we make like
01:46:50 50 or a hundred of these things and remove like five of them and then we're stuck with like 45 pins
01:46:56 that only or 95 pins that only exist for the sake of like a meme like a joke like what do we do with
01:47:03 these right I I um I feel maybe we can um like phrase the vote in a way that's like like if you're
01:47:13 like do you think that we could do it so like a vote is not a vote basically is like a you you want
01:47:23 to buy this right it's like this is something this isn't just something you're voting for on the
01:47:28 for like this like you voting for this basically says like yeah if I have another like like I have
01:47:34 another like credit to spend or whatever on a pin and like this is the design I want yeah um yeah
01:47:41 um we could drive that home yeah I think it's probably implied but it'd be nice to reiterate
01:47:47 yeah yeah I don't know no idea to get home if anyone who anyone who has like multiple like
01:47:53 designs that they wanted probably would be voting that way anyway uh the only like if someone just
01:47:59 bought like one pin maybe they just wanted like the ratty fucker cop kill he didn't care about
01:48:03 anymore and so they just buy two and then they're like well you know I don't actually want anymore
01:48:08 but I'm still voting yeah I guess I'll vote for something fun I don't know I can't you know I
01:48:13 probably am like overthinking it and it won't be a huge deal or anything but you know I can't help
01:48:18 but imagine the worst-case scenario um I give you a bunch of crap uh I I was sort of like I don't
01:48:27 know I mean again like I like that okay this was a thing that the lecture heads the the the the
01:48:34 people are people who want to say the brain deads because it's like born deads but like
01:48:38 they're during the shamblers so it's like zombies right like you get it like brain yeah right I don't
01:48:44 know the jury's still at but anyway they really really liked the like everything is only canon
01:48:51 by consensus they really like latched onto that as like an idea and it was kind of like it's always
01:48:58 been like that no no no I know I'm saying that they like that was like while I was going through
01:49:04 the tour describing the districts they like really like appreciated that as like a core element of
01:49:11 rfck and like a way where it's like I I mean you know it's always been the case but it's like I never
01:49:16 really like thought of it as like yeah I guess that's like a defined characteristic of it and that's
01:49:21 almost like an ideological theme of in this war in a way where it's like everything is up to only
01:49:29 what people like believe is true like you know like there's so little to the actual game like
01:49:35 like the only thing that makes it cool really is what people think about it right um it's it's
01:49:43 like mob rule uh for the greater good um and it's it's epic and I really I I think that's just like
01:49:51 real play yeah it is it's like we're running our own little commune over here hell yeah um
01:49:59 there's a um I've talked I've talked about like the floraverse before you know what I'm you know
01:50:04 what that is it's a comic isn't it it is it is not just a comic it is a um it's it's comics but like
01:50:12 they had like community events where like um the one I remember was there was like there was like an
01:50:19 event in the comic where like the basically like the the the the protagonists were basically
01:50:26 going to be like fighting in a war and there was like a battle plan and like they had a community
01:50:32 event where like people who read the comic got the opportunity to like they could like write stories
01:50:38 or do art or like make videos or whatever that's sort of like it's like depict your character and
01:50:45 like what what is there like you will get assigned to like a commander or something and like like
01:50:51 make art of like your role in the battle right and like I think the creators ended up like featuring
01:50:58 some and be like like these like these the ones that get featured become canon yeah right we don't
01:51:03 even have we don't even have to like feature it yeah it's canon if people want it to be canon
01:51:08 yeah it's like very like it it feels very cool that it's like a big part of this is even though like
01:51:17 you know rck is like very tied into me and you in a way we don't have to be there for it to like
01:51:24 make sense for defunction because it's so like community driven where it's like the appeal is
01:51:30 like what you can do in this setting like we are almost like window dressing for the appeal in a way
01:51:38 yeah yeah for sure it's like your your passion for the show or for us individually like that brings
01:51:44 you here and with that now what are you going to do like what is going to transpire
01:51:51 and I really this is the sort of thing where this is what I'm thinking about uh in the what
01:52:00 kind of stuff do I want to make now that I don't want to do like podcasts and stuff like that uh too
01:52:05 often uh besides this one this one is special to me in rck is special but other than this one I
01:52:12 don't want to do it and I think I really love the like experimental aspect of endless war and I
01:52:19 really want to like do more stuff like it not just like make you know you could say that lonesome
01:52:23 cactus is like endless war but I don't mean like in the I want to make more discord bots but like I
01:52:27 really like I'm getting into like coding in a more like serious not just I can do python because I
01:52:34 have to do it so that I can do endless war stuff like I really like it and I feel like it's the
01:52:39 future in a way and that's the sort of stuff I want to do is I want to do more stuff that engages
01:52:43 people in the weird sort of you know endless war is very democratic sort of it's only the people the
01:52:51 updates do come out only you know are supplemental to the experience of endless war in a way like I
01:52:57 really like that I want to do more stuff like that that's where my head's at um that um I think it's
01:53:04 the most like interesting part about it right that's like the thing that makes it cool everything
01:53:08 else just like you know all right yeah it it does it I remember like reading that stuff about like
01:53:14 this like fan driven portion of like the floor reverse and thinking like that's really weird
01:53:19 like that's really cool like that's interesting I don't know I guess I like that like endless war
01:53:25 has like some elements of that to it um but more yeah um but with less porn unfortunately
01:53:34 unfortunately there's not as much four versus a lot of porn canon porn made by v creators uh I've
01:53:40 seen it it's a cool art style I like it it is a cool art style but so I think it's really good
01:53:46 whoever draws it I forget their name
01:53:54 I I can't I need to get a hose so I can do farming how long have we been going
01:53:58 let's find fucking plum to uh at least two I think maybe like two and a half hours what I don't
01:54:03 we're we're we're doing the edge of two hours right now we're on the edge of two hours okay
01:54:09 um god it really took us till seven to start yeah ball cool um
01:54:18 I don't know what do we what have we not discussed what's been getting mad lately
01:54:24 let's let's just get into the things that make us mad because that's where all my brain powers
01:54:28 going now it is great um do you want to start do you have something um oh god I have to think
01:54:36 about it I asked that question without any indication that would come back around to me uh
01:54:42 hmm I feel like I've been doing nothing but talking about what makes me mad makes me mad
01:54:50 well I hate I going back to what we were talking about the very beginning I hate
01:54:53 I hate school now because it's remote and dumb now and I'm painful that's awful it's really
01:54:59 terrible that's bullshit it's totally bullshit it's like it's unacceptable like they're not
01:55:05 giving you the fucking product you paid for no not at all like no like specifically like if you
01:55:10 want to roll back the clock and go into old pcp episodes like the biggest thing is I wanted to
01:55:15 be around other like new people and I wanted to have teachers one-on-one talk to me and like
01:55:20 that's not that like both of those things are like not happening anymore it's like it's it's
01:55:25 only the boring stupid parts that like I like like it's only the parts where I thought well
01:55:30 it's for the greater good it's but it's now there is no greater good and it's just is only terrible
01:55:36 yeah um I hate I hate how do I make quotes how do I do this guys in chat chat let me know
01:55:45 let me watch do you chat is it this it is that epic um so I'm mad about that I'm mad about like
01:55:55 mad about fucking like everyone you know what okay all right here's the thing I felt like this
01:56:01 way for a long time I think I've said this in a few podcasts before but and I don't know how
01:56:05 legitimate it is I don't know how much it is in my own head but I feel like I don't know anyone I
01:56:09 feel like no one knows me I don't mean that isn't like no one's smart enough to appreciate my
01:56:14 intellect I mean that in the sense that it's like I can talk to no one about anything that I care
01:56:18 about ever like I like I feel like I have been so I guess I guess it's my fault in a way where it's
01:56:25 like I've been like a very like isolated person for a lot of my life and like especially for like a
01:56:29 lot of my life leading up to like going to college and like talking to more people like I feel like
01:56:36 I have developed in ways that other people have not not say that I have done it more but just like
01:56:42 I have different interests than like everyone that I talk to and it feels terrible when I have to
01:56:47 like inner pot like or not inner podcast but in our like discord chats and I have to talk to people
01:56:52 and like remember that like I only am friends with like gamers and shit and it's like oh I have
01:56:58 nothing to say and it is terrible and I want to die I don't know if I don't like when I think about
01:57:03 these it's it flips us between why isn't everyone like me and I'm like why am I not like anyone else
01:57:08 it flips us between itself and then extrinsic man versus world man versus itself that's that's my
01:57:16 hatred that's my main hatred do you ever feel like you like you feel like I don't know no one else
01:57:24 gets it no one else understands no one else likes things that are good everyone else likes things
01:57:27 that are stupid and I can't talk to anyone yeah sure constantly epic I was just thinking that
01:57:35 about you cool hmm um what do you what would um what would you find satisfying what would make
01:57:46 you feel what would make you feel better well here you know what that but before we talk about that
01:57:51 here I'm gonna leave this into saying things that will people will have an emotional grip to this
01:57:55 now because okay here's the thing about the pcp and here's like the unfortunate truth about the
01:58:02 pcp and like here's how to fix it quote-unquote and the most unhelpful way possible is that you
01:58:07 can't quote-unquote fix it because again I guess it's not broken and you know it's not it's not
01:58:12 that bad but what people say like people when people say oh I miss topics they're like they
01:58:17 they miss the sort of cohesion they miss the sort of like you know what this podcast is about a
01:58:22 certain thing this podcast is about and everyone has like stuff contribute here's the thing that
01:58:27 matters most in podcasts is the conversation and people like having interesting things to say about
01:58:31 you know to one another in the conversation that is transpiring and the reason why people
01:58:36 dislike the pcp or at least why I think so is because the conversations usually feel pretty
01:58:41 shallow because most people are doing different things like we aren't usually like okay here's
01:58:45 how the pcp used to happen again when I was on and when I observed it might have changed by now
01:58:49 but it's like you and bin talk about or I'm sorry you and Nate talk about politics for a while and
01:58:54 you guys have something to say about that so it's like you know it is a conversation and it's cool
01:58:59 and then it's Nate and Tom talk about video game news for a little while and then they have something
01:59:03 to say about that but it's kind of like two pairs of people like constantly like reversing and
01:59:09 switching off about like the one thing that they have in common it's never like a big cohesive
01:59:15 like group conversation talking about similar things because not everyone's on the same page
01:59:19 anymore and that's not something to be fixed or like oh you know like fuck the pcp like it sucks
01:59:23 and we have to fix it because there's nothing to be fixed about it it's just that people are
01:59:27 different now and we are no longer all my little pony reviewers who are all in the same cultural
01:59:31 sphere and that just is the way that people grow apart from another but that's that's what I'm feeling
01:59:36 that's the sadness that I get is that I don't know anyone anymore and we all don't be like I don't care
01:59:41 about fucking video game twitter you know I don't care about that so I have nothing to contribute
01:59:46 in those conversations um and I have nothing to contribute in other conversations like that where
01:59:51 it's like well it's just what I was saying yeah that uh I so what would make me feel better
01:59:58 is I guess getting new friends that's that sounds like a rejection of the old friends they don't
02:00:03 mean in a way but like I don't know it's hard it's hard to make friends that you actually want to
02:00:08 because the the entire like what's the words like I don't know it's just hard it's just hard to go
02:00:16 out there and try and meet new people uh when you're so yeah especially considering uh quarantine
02:00:21 yeah exactly so you you can't you have to I I've I've long considered going on like forums and trying
02:00:26 to become like a forum person but like I don't know those days are behind me and my my days role
02:00:31 playing pokemon are behind me um I tried getting to I like really tried really really hard to get
02:00:38 into reddit I just could never get it into my like I don't know I could not get addicted to reddit in
02:00:43 the way that I wanted to where I really wanted to like prowl around subreds and like get involved
02:00:48 with that community but I was always just repulsed by like the UI of reddit and I just hated it but
02:00:55 yeah uh I mean I I tried you know for a while there I was trying to like go out to like a
02:01:04 fucking comics club and stuff trying to like meet people that way didn't work yeah didn't
02:01:10 like with anything I completely agree do I I like try like a big part of like it like
02:01:16 oh I already made it okay never mind um I I tried really hard to go into a lot of clubs and at my
02:01:21 school and you you went to a club um and it was a nightmare and they were all like that it was
02:01:28 pretty funny it was pretty funny though um I guess I guess I guess that I guess that is a
02:01:33 word in the English language hmm um nightmare but yeah it was like
02:01:41 I don't know I feel like I don't click with anyone and it's a nightmare and there's nothing to be
02:01:45 said I guess or done about it uh but that's just that's one of the things that's why I'm angry
02:01:50 that is the thing that I'm angry about always now is that that's relatable I feel that way all
02:01:54 the time even before before quarantine I felt that way and it's become all the more acute now
02:02:00 I feel that hard core but you know hard core okay so there's like degrees of this right where it's
02:02:07 like with like a date like I know nothing in common with Nate like I don't do anime or like
02:02:11 video games or stuff really and that's and say that I don't like it but like you know he's one of
02:02:14 the the ones that I'm most far removed from in in the way that I'm describing right now
02:02:19 for the sake of demonstration but like you and me do talk and stuff like we do hang out in person
02:02:24 so like you know or we did well yeah sure but I'm saying that uh what do you want to talk about Ben
02:02:30 you know we we we are not so far gone that it's not worth it to even try to uh accommodate one
02:02:36 other what do you want to talk about I'll I'll get into some stuff what do you want um we were
02:02:42 doing audible and stuff for a while we were both into books oh you know I I told you that I started
02:02:47 listening to um the bullshit jobs I never finished it I think I like halfway halfway through
02:02:54 yeah that's a thing though right that's pretty cool um um um um um yeah I don't know there's
02:03:05 nothing new there's nothing new to report over here um well I'm saying what what kind of animal
02:03:12 crossing I guess I'm saying what kind of things that you do you wish that people would talk about
02:03:18 or that you wish that you like like what like on what way do you wish that people were more on the
02:03:24 same like cultural level than you and like yeah that um I I guess I I wish that like um
02:03:35 I wish that like when I when I went to like uh the comics round table or something people were
02:03:40 talking about like I wish people were talking about it in a more specific way I wish people were like
02:03:46 there to like first of all I wish people were more like serious about it I wish people were like
02:03:54 better I wish people were there to like collaborate or like work together in some way
02:04:02 to like pool our resources instead of just to kind of like bullshit about like oh yeah here's like
02:04:09 the newest thing I don't know the things that they were there to work on were like
02:04:12 planning on like which like cons to go to and like I don't care about that yeah um
02:04:21 I don't know they just yeah I don't know I would like for I would like to meet people that were like
02:04:29 in your field they were serious about like doing the kind of things that I do and were like interested
02:04:36 in like yeah working together and like doing something so you want to meet more web comics
02:04:42 people is what you're saying well I don't know I mean I guess uh yet well I think a big part of
02:04:49 the comics round table right is that it's like a lot of people who are meeting in person so there's
02:04:54 gonna be a lot of like you know what cons do we go to you know like with our bodies because we're
02:04:58 human beings but yeah that might not like um I say that I say that but like at the same time um
02:05:10 I don't know I don't even know like what I don't really know like what I would like want to work
02:05:17 with people I don't know I guess if they were like well it's not about working way it's just
02:05:21 talking about it's just or like maybe it would be cool if like somebody had like a zine or something
02:05:26 and someone was like looking for like stuff to like put in a zine and I could be like hey I could
02:05:31 make stuff for your zine or some shit like that I don't know you know what the greatest service
02:05:38 we've given to the rfck audiences is that we've created a fandom for them to exist in because
02:05:44 there's nothing nothing better than being a part of a fandom those like that is the ideal state of
02:05:53 a human being you know people in the wild like like a like a Russoian man in the jungle longs be a part
02:05:59 of the homesuck fandom like that's their biggest like what in the world outside of like shelter
02:06:04 to their mazla's hierarchy of needs yeah exactly because it's so home stuck fandom is home stuck
02:06:10 fandom because it's when you're in a fandom right it's just big enough where you get like a big
02:06:15 like display of like a large uh diverse sort of you know there's a lot of different types of artists
02:06:22 who will want to allow different types of things you know it's a very it's big enough where you get
02:06:25 that diversification that goes with civilization then you it's also small enough and you have such
02:06:30 a thing in common with one another where it's easy to make friends and easy to talk to one other
02:06:34 able easy to find people you can google search like carcat anime music video yowie big cock version
02:06:40 two and then you'll get like 15 different results and it'll be epic um right sure but i mean that
02:06:49 that's like the coolest thing and i wish i was a part of a fandom because okay go on go like every
02:06:55 like weekly my little point episodes you tune in every week and then you have like a whole bunch
02:06:59 of new fan stuff to do amazing you know and one of us is a homesuck update there's another whole
02:07:06 round of videos and arts and stuff to do the homesick was crazy about it uh i missed that i want
02:07:13 that how do i get into it without having to deal with new shows which are bad and stupid and i hate it
02:07:17 that's the goal that's the goal for that i think i think that's like the way forward for me is i
02:07:23 need to become a part of a fandom and then just redo that um i um i would be like you know something
02:07:35 like um that like like the dsa or that like like socialist club that you were like that we tried to
02:07:41 go to the meeting of like i feel like if something like that were good it would be really great
02:07:47 but i have the suspicion that it would suck yeah and be boring i mean i don't know but like what like
02:07:56 what do what do you what do they do yeah what do you think they actually just sit around and talk
02:08:00 about shit and like there's i mean i assume there's no real like action probably probably not um
02:08:11 i don't know but like maybe maybe that just means there's nothing there's nothing to do
02:08:19 you just you just gotta like lay just just lay down and die actually like what's the point you know
02:08:25 there's nothing to be done you just give up you have merry weather surely can meet more
02:08:30 webcomics people like that and then merry weather doesn't like no i don't know the i mean yeah i know
02:08:40 merry weather but like he is just kind of he i don't know what does it like what exactly does
02:08:49 that get me access to i'm saying that he's a part of the greater webcomic sphere i mean and he's
02:08:54 particularly well known at that as far i mean i don't know but i i think he's a particularly well
02:08:59 well known as that and you mean i know him and me yeah exactly so you can use that point that
02:09:05 data point in your network to think about cynically and try and reach out to more people try and get
02:09:10 more involved with him and then you'll meet more people merry weather is like a very well connected
02:09:15 guy there you go well no well no don't there you go me because like what what what does it
02:09:24 what does it do for me what what do i take and do with that information what you take and do with
02:09:31 that is become better friends with merry weather and then when you were better friends with merry
02:09:34 weather first of all you may enjoy his company as a friend but if you want to think about extremely
02:09:38 cynically you can become better friends with merry weather to get access to his greater network
02:09:42 through collaborations and stuff like when you were just like you were just saying where
02:09:46 you may be able to meet people through calls and stuff like that and through just me and then while
02:09:51 being his friend you're able to meet more people that you would be able to collaborate with and do
02:09:55 stuff like that zine that hypothetical zine i don't want to like i don't want to come off as like
02:10:02 just poo pooing you out of hand or anything but this is like this this is giving me this is giving
02:10:09 me like pound of pavement vibes like it's network like oh it's just like just network and make
02:10:15 connections and like and and do what you know well like who like like what what what's the play here
02:10:22 like i go hey merry weather hey merry weather uh introduce introduce me to some like well connected
02:10:28 like like artist people and then he's like oh yeah okay okay here here's um here's um the guy who
02:10:35 does like that that one that everyone's heard and i go oh cool cool cool and i say hey uh i'm ben i
02:10:42 drew some comics and they go like oh yeah cool um that's cool i also draw some and i go yeah i know
02:10:48 i've heard about your stuff and they go oh cool nice like okay and like i don't know well well
02:10:56 okay if you have no want to meet other people in the field then yeah okay then there's no point
02:11:02 but i thought you were just saying that you wanted to talk to more people who were taking
02:11:06 webcomic seriously i thought that i thought that was the whole impetus for this conversation um
02:11:13 i i don't maybe maybe i would maybe if i had more like wait dude i'm gonna milk a cow i'm gonna
02:11:21 milk a cow dude shut the fuck up dude shut the fuck maybe if i have i got milk raw got milk dude
02:11:26 yeah more regular contact with people who are doing that kind of thing maybe it would occur to me
02:11:32 like what to do with such in such just scenario oh as it stands i have like no like i have no like
02:11:43 goal or i have no like oh this is what i need to do like here here's how i like take it to the
02:11:50 next level like i have no idea you're you're you're a very even steven sturdy person been your
02:11:57 horizons when i feel like whenever we have a show where like what are we doing guys where
02:12:02 you want to go i feel like you're you're always like i just want to do what i'm doing right now
02:12:06 because i'm having fun and it's cool and i'm i'm perfectly fine where i am i feel like that's
02:12:10 always your responses you don't want to you want like right now you don't want to meet new people
02:12:14 you just want to hang out not to say that's even a bad thing that just seems to be always the case
02:12:20 well maybe it sounds like that but um i don't know i do feel kind of like isolated i guess i do
02:12:29 you know i don't know i i'm like i have two minds about it because like i have like talked to other
02:12:33 like i've talked to other like webcomics people and like they're usually like fine but like i'm not
02:12:42 generally that interested in what they're doing and like they're like only like marginally interested
02:12:48 in what i'm doing and it's like okay well i guess we know each other all right you just keep doing
02:12:52 what you're doing i'll just keep doing what i'm doing you know whatever and um so i don't know
02:12:59 like i i guess like i i would like to know more people like that but like i have when i have done
02:13:06 it in the past it's just been like uh well uh all right see you i think i get what you mean like
02:13:13 it's easy to want that in the abstract but like the steps it would take to require to get to
02:13:18 a point where you have like a good friend that you're able to like confer and like that it seems
02:13:23 like the kind of thing that i ought to want and maybe be like striving for but i do not know what
02:13:30 the end goal of it is we're not the end goal be companionship and and someone's shoulder to cry on
02:13:38 and um fellowship in men i mean sure yes but uh like
02:13:50 i mean that's like um that's like oh but what if you made a new best friend it's like well i don't
02:13:55 know what what if i did yeah you can't like set out to do that i i guess it is sort of like a
02:14:04 almost inherently selfish sort of thing because i'm always like i always am desperate for someone
02:14:10 i can talk about history with not talk to someone about his like you know i did the the lecture and
02:14:16 that was like cool but not at all what is a satiety thing where it's like instead of you know like
02:14:22 describing something to someone i want to like you know discuss it with someone i can't do that to
02:14:26 someone who have just regurgitated information to like i've always wanted that but it's like
02:14:31 you can't just like manufacture someone like like really like the the reason i would want that is so
02:14:37 that i can say things to them and then have them hear my thoughts and be able to understand them
02:14:41 like it like i say that i want someone to discuss it with and have them what the there's a little
02:14:46 cold going on over here uh so that they will be able to understand and like parse what i'm saying
02:14:50 to them but in a way it's also very selfish because it's like well i want them to be able to
02:14:54 parse it so that i can speak to what's in my head like i have things that i want to say to them
02:14:59 right now and i want them to listen to me i get like i guess it's selfish in that way do you want
02:15:04 to be listened to or do you want to be talked to well i i want it it's two things i like i can't
02:15:13 i can't talk to someone in the sense that i can't like you know i meet someone i just want my friends
02:15:18 and they don't know anything about history and i say hey let me relate to you this tale that has
02:15:22 happened once like i don't want to do that because that's bored and there's no reason for me to just
02:15:26 like talk someone's ear off of that something they don't understand but i do want to talk to someone
02:15:30 who does get it like you know someone who knows what i want to discuss about so that we can have
02:15:35 it like a conversation about it because i have a lot of like thoughts about history but i can't
02:15:40 talk to anyone about it because none of them know anything about it so you know there's no
02:15:43 there's no conversation to be had but those conversations would be selfish in the sense
02:15:47 where it's like i want to talk to someone else about history i want them to understand what
02:15:51 i'm talking about so that i can say all these things i've been on my mind but i've not been able to
02:15:56 express anyone else because no one gets their cares you know what i mean do you understand
02:16:00 um kind of maybe a bit well there
02:16:12 but like you can't like it's you can't just like say to someone like hey get into this like genre
02:16:16 of like human experience please so that i can talk to you about it like it's not you know
02:16:22 you can't convince anyone to do something like that no you've got to find someone who's already
02:16:28 into it yeah exactly and and then you have to in order to do that you have to like plot around
02:16:33 r slash history and it's stupid and dumb and i hate that place and i guess i guess i feel like um
02:16:40 you know since i'm like a comics guy i should have like comics friends but i have like i kind of
02:16:46 have like very little to say about my comics like outside of the like the comics themselves
02:16:51 you know it's just like fucking Hideaki ono and even galleon it's like you know he said what he
02:16:57 wanted to say by making the comic he doesn't have like there's not like he doesn't need to like go
02:17:04 and like talk about them or like explain what he means like they just speak for themselves
02:17:09 like all the stuff that i make i feel like it speaks for itself i don't need to like discuss it
02:17:16 you know so um maybe that's like a weakness well i i feel like i feel like ben what's
02:17:22 happening here is that you know that you should want human connection but you don't actually care
02:17:27 and you just have this husk of an idea in your brain that it's good to have those things but you
02:17:31 don't actually care at all is what it seems like like it's like when you say these things like but
02:17:36 like what would be the point of talking to other people well the point to me would be you're talking
02:17:40 to other people and that like that is the point in it of itself but it's not an inherent that's
02:17:45 not an inherent good to me it is but i that's just the difference um it can be good sometimes talking
02:17:54 to other people sucks well okay yeah but that's because those people suck and you shouldn't be
02:18:00 talking to them like if you're talking to someone in the conversation is bad and you don't like that
02:18:03 person then you just don't talk to them well sure easy i mean definitely definitely uh
02:18:13 okay what have you learned i tell you know what good question i i tell you boy i tell you well
02:18:20 i'm waiting for my crops to grow and they will be glorious i'm gonna get pink purple radish

02:21:46 i actually got like a big leg up because like my roommate had already he had already found he
02:21:52 already started planting a bunch of like resources that i needed to craft some tools that i needed
02:21:56 like um he already had some stone for me to make an axe out of and he had like wood that i could
02:22:02 make a ladder which is like apparently he had to run around without a ladder for a while which
02:22:08 must have been like so annoying because it means you can't climb cliffs so like half of the island
02:22:12 would have been off limits to him jesus yeah um he built he built like some bridges he built he was
02:22:19 he's in the middle of building a ramp up like the hill that's pretty cool yeah so like i have benefited
02:22:25 i have benefited from his efforts and also like um it's just kind of cool like we're on the same
02:22:33 island like we can like um like leave shit on each other's lawns actually like a bunch of people at
02:22:38 my house started one uh four four different people now or all have like have set up a tent or built a
02:22:45 house on the island uh dwube is like up north in the mountain and he is like turning it into like
02:22:52 trash mountain he has like junk and like boxes and like cardboard boxes and just like life
02:22:58 preservers and just like shit lying out strewn all around that's what he's going for he's doing
02:23:04 on purpose he loves it that sounds like a beautiful place ben hey it's pretty great it's

02:25:33 getting blaps all the time our creations are are rising up against us i'm always getting messages
02:25:38 that i haven't been able to uphold my pledge to people with lots of characters and endless war
02:25:42 is just blapping at you we needed they're rising up in right now they're rising up in our midst
02:25:48 what do we do i can we do there's nothing we're powerless there's there's only absolute is there's
02:25:57 only sweet abyss our creations have outgrown us who would win a fight probably endless war i i don't
02:26:04 think there's anything that wants me to just kind of like do he's just like a cactus yeah he just
02:26:10 dances yeah that's that's cool that's cool though he doesn't have a single beam
02:26:19 or does he well make a madden we'll find out only
02:26:25 oh did i just he's what did he just oh he dropped beef amazing i've never imagined such a thing would
02:26:31 happen if i slayed a cow anything anything else happening ben anything going on do you think
02:26:38 do you think we're gonna survive to see another radcon do you think we're gonna see another radcon
02:26:42 before uh we're we're running out of dodge and the pcp crumbles like the usyrian empire and we are
02:26:47 all scattered across the air we always think the pcp is gonna crumble it probably never will
02:26:53 no i mean there have been times in the past when we like it it actually seemed like the pcp might
02:27:00 just like be over soon or we're everyone's gonna get sick of it i actually don't win like when when
02:27:06 would it hasn't happened yet um i don't think i've ever actually seriously there's ever actually
02:27:13 been like seriously on the table at least i've never thought so uh because there's been no reason
02:27:19 like like it's like it there's no reason to leave the pcp there's no reason for the pcp to end there's
02:27:23 no reason to not be on the pcp like there's no reason well that's how i feel that's how i feel now
02:27:27 yeah how i feel now i don't know um shit when was i feel like there were like not that recently
02:27:36 i don't know maybe it was back in like the monkey era it seemed like it seemed like man this
02:27:40 shit is getting like this shit is getting heated she's getting toxic maybe she like shouldn't be
02:27:44 here anymore really damn there were there were times but like you know i was never like on the
02:27:50 verge of like handing in my tenuring my resignation letter or anything um i guess it's not it's i guess
02:27:59 there were times i had the sense that like this this shit is not going to go on for like another
02:28:04 year like what are we even going to do for another year uh same thing that's oh yeah i mean the
02:28:11 question the answer to that is just like what we've done every year well we do every night pinky
02:28:16 mm-hmm um what do you think okay radcon five do you think we should do anything different
02:28:27 like having done radcon four and that we all agree like it went by really fast i there are two things
02:28:33 felt insubstantial i i think there's anything yes yes 100 i've been thinking about this i think
02:28:39 there are two things number one we have to force everyone they have to have like a gentleman's agreement
02:28:45 where your your lecture has to be like 99 done when you come or like very like you have to
02:28:51 like your lecture like you know that's fair i i really wish i had like i i meant to prepare mine
02:28:57 ahead of time but then i forgot that i had yet i had to do like the group shot art and so i spent
02:29:03 like the last couple days before radcon doing that otherwise i would have been like doing all the
02:29:09 notes and stuff for the year and i would have had it done um not yet like me and you specifically
02:29:15 just because we i don't know just do whatever same chances we took a long time to do like to
02:29:20 make the notes and do the stuff for our lectures and uh it was a lot of time wasted and it sucked
02:29:26 and i feel ashamed and it won't happen again uh and i i was i was doing the research for my
02:29:33 lecture but like i don't even know what it was it just felt like like i was i think it's because
02:29:39 like history it's like that's a big area where like a big thing is you don't want to be inaccurate
02:29:44 when you say something like you don't want to fuck up when you're saying something about a history
02:29:47 or else you know your ball is going to be ripped off uh so like there's a lot of like moments where
02:29:52 it's like i i think i can just talk off the cup about this because i think i remember it pretty
02:29:56 well and then like you know i i would be like well let's make sure uh and so i would spend like a
02:30:02 fucking hour researching just make sure i did everything correctly um uh i'm scared i'm scared
02:30:09 of my lecture i'm oh well actually before we get into that so number one we make sure that all of
02:30:13 our ideas you know our lectures and notes are taken and we're ready to like go um but also
02:30:19 we i want to do like a really fucking long i just want i just want to be as long as fucking i want
02:30:23 to be like like a month like two three weeks i want like a long rad con
02:30:30 um you you see want to be longer yeah i want to be longer and for us to come into it with all of
02:30:37 our stuff so we can just have like like days upon days to work and just to do like record stuff i
02:30:44 yeah longer i mean it would it makes it cost more to like stay longer but yeah i do in hindsight
02:30:50 i do wish it had been longer ten ten days didn't feel like enough no not at all
02:30:57 so do it i do so i would i would like i think that we should do it we we kind i mean we kind of
02:31:03 did it at the time that we did and for the length that we did because it was around when i would be
02:31:07 able to for school um and so i think that next time i think we should just do it next summer
02:31:14 and like so i'm able to come you know selfish so i can come for as long as possible i think we
02:31:18 should do it for like seriously like two to three weeks like i think we should do like a long like
02:31:22 a fucking like radcon five like sabbatical it should be like a big deal like we were at there for
02:31:27 like a while um at radcon five yeah yeah like how long two to three weeks man three weeks god damn
02:31:39 two two two three you know around around that but yeah oh a lot two weeks is a lot i mean i
02:31:45 guess ten days is a pretty long time two weeks is a long time well i mean it's four more days
02:31:50 than we were there which yeah you're right you're right just that's like that's half of a month uh
02:31:57 yeah but but but think about how like if we like okay next radcon we will probably have more things
02:32:03 like the ova like we know we'll probably have a thing like that for next radcon so if we just like
02:32:10 and theoretically given the more time we could get more ambitious just keep it the thing as it is but
02:32:14 like we could directly like have like i don't know again more stuff more obligations and stuff we
02:32:21 have to do so having us be there for much longer just allow for more things to promise the kick
02:32:26 start and more like opportunities for us to record things other than you know the two big things
02:32:31 we're able to do now than just like a fuck ton of lectures and streams i'm i don't know i'm
02:32:38 undecided on how i think about this how do you think radcon went i think i'm second guess
02:32:44 in myself by what by what metric by like house like i guess like i guess this could mean anything
02:32:49 but like how successful like do you think that we yeah that could mean well i think in terms of
02:32:54 like the stuff that we made it was a big success like that we made good stuff yeah do you think we
02:33:00 made enough you know it does like because it feels like it was over too soon i feel like
02:33:09 there was more we could have made but when i think back on it like it's not like we wasted a whole
02:33:14 lot of the time like people were working on their stuff or like doing their stuff like most of the
02:33:21 time so like i can't really feel like oh we could have we could have done more i do i do feel like
02:33:29 we made good use of the time um yeah i think the only i think the only thing was there wasn't
02:33:38 there wasn't enough like unstructured like downtime i mean there were streams there were casual streams
02:33:45 but those were like those are not the same as just like hanging out and you're kind of on during
02:33:52 them a little bit even the sleepy ones it's it's interesting that you say that i i feel like that's
02:33:57 a very unbeen same thing to say why because i feel like we've had conversations like this before
02:34:03 where it's like i feel like you i mean we were just saying earlier about how uh you don't have to
02:34:09 fake it to be on a show like i would i would imagine that you would feel like being on a stream
02:34:14 would be the same thing as talking to us normally no that's not what i said what i said was that
02:34:17 like i'm my genuine self but i do like bring extra energy to it i do kind of like you know
02:34:26 i do like um try and like present like a higher like energy like the most engaging version
02:34:34 of myself which does require some some amount of like effort this does require some mental
02:34:41 energy not like a lot but like it's just being on a stream is not like just hanging out in private
02:34:52 yeah well i definitely agree yeah oh i felt that if i'm stupid and we didn't we didn't really do a
02:34:58 lot of just hanging out in any like context that wasn't like on a stream we were always either
02:35:04 like working on getting something ready that we were planning on doing or we were or we were on
02:35:09 stream meaning you hung out my bedroom a lot weirdly led red con um three we just hung out yeah yeah
02:35:17 i feel like that's like what red con four was missing yeah well that and like coming up with
02:35:25 like shit that like no one had thought like like 10 paces in draw like we just came up with that
02:35:31 like while we were there yeah and then we just did it and i feel like that fact that it was like a
02:35:35 new thing that we were sort of like envisioning and then executing made it feel new and like made
02:35:44 the process feel like more memorable and therefore it like seems longer in memory maybe um i imagine
02:35:53 it's a lot of like warped like what we perceive to have been longer like you are only at red
02:35:58 con three for like nothing like you were there for like half of it so like it was definitely
02:36:04 longer like right on four was definitely like objectively longer especially for you but like
02:36:08 it didn't feel it didn't feel longer yeah even for me and i've said that over and over again
02:36:14 but it's true it's weird but it's true and it's very i i really just think it comes down to the
02:36:20 fact that like more of the time at red con four was like structured and being used deliberately
02:36:26 yeah and made it go made it makes it not really like sticking my memory very much because like i
02:36:33 was focused on accomplishing a specific task i don't know if this is a good dichotomy to do you
02:36:38 to work in but like red con three had a lot of like mid level content where there's a lot of
02:36:45 like sequels to shows that we were doing already um so there's like the the hippos jrpg series and
02:36:51 then um like you know potty cast and stuff like that at red con three there's a lot of like medium
02:36:55 level stuff like that where people were constantly recording like kind of just like new installments
02:37:00 of series but here it was like non-stop just like the highest level like lectures um kicks
02:37:07 our obligations like the big shit like it was not well well i mean there were um there was
02:37:14 mid-level stuff like there was um the digi like interviews those are cool i wish you had gotten
02:37:19 one i wish yeah i wish i had gotten to do one too i he had meant to do it with everyone but we
02:37:25 just ran out of time i mean i guess i could do one anytime if you wanted to reach out we wouldn't
02:37:31 have to be in person and there was like the um the weed or the two two toks in a bloke uh was a thing
02:37:41 i guess i would call that mid-level content what it was like low level content is like pooping on
02:37:48 yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly yes yeah exactly that yeah um yeah there was there was a decent
02:37:55 them there was i think there was a decent amount of that of the low level stuff it's it's funny that
02:38:00 we like have just just now like sort of invented this like category this level categorizing system
02:38:07 but like we know what it means yeah um do you think there was more or less of that at four than
02:38:14 i think i think that it was highly stratified i don't think that's right it was like very like
02:38:19 up to contrast redcon four where it's like a lot of low level and a lot of high level but not that
02:38:24 much mid-level and then redcon three was more like it like an even sort of blend yeah no you're
02:38:30 probably right there because like yeah maybe this is something that didn't happen as much at redcon
02:38:36 four was like one person would be doing one thing in one room and some other people would be doing
02:38:42 something else in some other room yeah like i was saying earlier yeah we kind of expected that
02:38:48 because like looking at the house we all we all kind of agreed that like all right so basically
02:38:52 there's going to be like one central main room yeah we're mostly all going to be occupying yeah
02:38:57 and like there's going to be less of an opportunity for like people to split up and go to like a
02:39:02 separate part of the house and do a separate thing because like the redcon three house was massive
02:39:09 it was insane do you think we used the beach enough um i think we should have done more just like
02:39:16 on it like you know not having it be like a big you know like i think we're fine on like beach
02:39:22 themed things right but i feel like we have just like been on it more maybe i mean i didn't really
02:39:28 i didn't really want to like just hang out on the beach for the sake of being there
02:39:32 mm-hmm so like i don't feel like i like missed out on the beach at all um i feel like we did
02:39:40 enough with it in terms of like videos that it was justified i don't know i don't know what
02:39:52 else we would have done i want rckcon again so badly i love that shit i love it what is this
02:39:59 i feel like we just did one we did one in february uh january right was it january i think it was
02:40:07 january mm okay you're probably right um yeah still it feels like it just happens no dude i i'm
02:40:14 i'm hunkering for it i'm hankering i want that i want it real bad because that's like the cool
02:40:20 that's like the people who show up to that are like so like such like old rck people it really
02:40:26 feels like i've known them for a long time so it's cool it's cool just to talk to them it is it's
02:40:32 really is really great like um i'm sure we've talked about this before but like after after the
02:40:37 lecture we all just like talked about like funny rfck stuff that happened and we were like oh we
02:40:42 should have talked about that in the lecture like yeah we could have talked about that in the lecture
02:40:47 really oh that's a great story um i'm stupid we all said in unison are we are we judging are we
02:40:57 judging moments oh god yeah oh no no what i don't want it do you want to do you want to push that
02:41:06 back uh well we'll see we'll see how tomorrow goes we have a pretty pat i'm we're doing oh i don't
02:41:12 know like that we're doing a muck tournament there's a muck tournament happening tomorrow
02:41:16 wait really yeah the muck cup is back yeah oh my god yeah uh no i had not even heard about that
02:41:24 and it'll be happening currently when you watch this have you watched this as it comes out and
02:41:27 viewer it'll be happening right now so if you're listening to this have you already missed it um
02:41:33 no it will be ongoing currently if you if you click on it as soon as it comes out on this episode
02:41:38 i mean um it'll still be ongoing uh you know one of the one of the pins i did design a pin that
02:41:46 was supposed to be like a muck cup batch and that's one of the pins that we could end up making if
02:41:51 like enough people wanted i think it would be cool but like like with everything i'm worried
02:41:56 about like okay but it would be cool but how many people actually want one right how is would the
02:42:02 cost of making it actually be justified well i mean yeah it's cool though do you know you know
02:42:11 the one it's like it's like a little glob of goo and it looks like the muck colors
02:42:18 it's a weird little bug it just like hops on my hand i have to pee real quick if you
02:42:23 no i have no i have to pee real quick fuck a weird little bug just hopped on my hand
02:42:29 it's it's like a tiny little like i guess it was like a beetle it was very small

02:46:02 and i meet people and i have uh interactions that are varied and uh engaging and uh not boring
02:46:13 you and like i don't know that's it hmm a tough equation to crack a very tough thing to acquire
02:46:24 a life very sad very strange it's pretty wacky huh pretty wacky i guess that you know i i guess
02:46:31 there's no need for like a like a greater thing than that i guess that is what everyone wants
02:46:37 at the end of the day just to have to talk to i feel like that's all pretty normal it's all
02:46:43 pretty normal hashtag relatable shit it's just it's relatable in the same way that like i love
02:46:50 drinking water is like a very normal like relatable thing to say that's right you know i am like i
02:46:56 feel like i should you know like you said before like i guess i have the sense that i should be
02:47:03 like socializing with people like being friends with people who like make
02:47:06 comics or something because like that's what i do but like i don't need to like i don't really at the
02:47:12 end of the day if i'm not like doing it if i'm not doing anything that's like advancing my career
02:47:18 with that or whatever i don't actually care if like my friends make comics or anything you're such
02:47:24 an enigma bin you like two sentences ago you're like i want to have like a diverse interactions
02:47:30 with human beings i want to go outside i want to have fun but like that's how is that not how is
02:47:35 that in any way in conflict with what i just said i like you want like do you okay what is what do
02:47:43 you want okay why do you want to have to go outside and have complex interactions with people
02:47:48 other than to talk with people like what in what way other is because it's what no like
02:47:56 i feel like i feel like we've got our wires crossed here like i definitely i yeah i do like like
02:48:03 meeting people and interacting with you i was just saying that it doesn't have to be i don't
02:48:07 care if it's like about comics oh well okay um and so like if we're talking if we're talking about
02:48:14 like oh you know have like friends who do comic stuff like had like be part of like a web comic
02:48:21 circle or whatever it's like well do i actually get anything out of it like does that actually
02:48:26 does does that benefit me in any way if not then like what's the point like why even focus on like
02:48:32 having that particular kind of like a circle you know what i mean okay i get what you mean now
02:48:38 but i think the the obvious answer is that is that like is that not the easiest way to acquire new
02:48:44 people like it maybe it's not well that's what i thought that's what i thought but it never worked
02:48:49 it never like got it never made any headway how hard have you tried though i don't know
02:48:55 how hard am i supposed to try with all your might it will make you turn red with the force of blood
02:49:02 you say you say that you say that like oh well how hard have you tried it's like okay well how
02:49:08 well how should i be trying what what what are the steps i should be following that i'm not doing
02:49:15 the ones we're talking about i mean okay i mean it's it's easier said than done like and you know
02:49:21 it may not be the best way but like you know talking to maryweather is a way to accomplish
02:49:26 meeting new people maybe it's not the best but that is a way you're you're gonna sit there and
02:49:32 you're gonna tell me that if you were in my position you would like shoot maryweather a
02:49:38 discord message that's like hey maryweather introduce me to some no no no no because i'm not
02:49:46 because i'm not insane because i'm not insane i wouldn't do that yeah that's right that's right
02:49:51 okay that's not like okay okay okay okay i'm using the language i'm using because it's
02:49:58 easiest to communicate but i'm like none of this is like you have to use maryweather to
02:50:04 and ends like you use a tool like i that's what you just said that's not no i did not say that you
02:50:09 have to use him like a tool i know that's what it may sound like but that's not what i mean like you
02:50:13 don't have to just use him i'm saying that if you want to make friends then maryweather has friends
02:50:18 maybe you want to hang out with maryweather so that you can meet new people but you don't have to
02:50:22 treat so cynically a part of that could just be you want to hang out with the maryweather or you
02:50:25 know what am i gonna what am i gonna do with maryweather well if you have nothing in common
02:50:29 my interactions with maryweather are just like he'll occasionally like send me a funny
02:50:35 hello message on twitter dm's and i'll like respond with like i'll say something to him
02:50:41 well i mean there there there are ways to talk to people other than waiting for them to contact
02:50:46 you i mean you this is what i'm saying so so you're saying that i should just like be like dm and
02:50:52 say hey do hey what's going on i saw that post they made their day or i follow your comic i'm
02:50:58 interested in you or anything like hey maryweather what's up do you want to do something maybe not
02:51:03 even related to what what like what do you have interest like animal like animal crossing animal
02:51:10 crossing how about that how about that you're literally telling me to pound the pavement
02:51:14 and network right now i i'm i'm telling you that you can make friends if you want to that's what
02:51:21 i'm saying to you right now is that you have the power to do so and i don't understand why you don't
02:51:25 is right i'm telling me pound the pavement okay what what what it what it okay what does that
02:51:32 mean exactly and just try harder you're not trying hard enough you're not working hard enough
02:51:37 it's not like a like a Protestant work ethic thing it's not that you aren't like
02:51:42 it's not i okay okay here's what i say here's here's what i am seeing right now i you say that you
02:51:50 want do you want you're kidding no no no hold on hold on hold on i feel like you've got the wrong
02:51:55 idea i feel like you are advising me as though i'm sitting here like i'm so lonely like i don't
02:52:02 know anyone like oh i can't i just can't i would i would i would love i would love to just have like
02:52:07 anyone that i could just talk to like oh if only if only i could talk to somebody
02:52:13 and about anything and you're like hmm well let me just pick a person that you know like why
02:52:20 don't you talk to this person like yeah like obviate if i wanted to do that i would just do it
02:52:26 but like i talk to mary whether occasionally there's nothing like there's nothing like
02:52:34 like there's nothing like wanting there there's like i don't need to like push that there's no
02:52:41 where to push that that just is what it is i don't know if i'm just being misunderstood i don't
02:52:50 have your misunderstanding no i i i guess i guess i'm misunderstanding you because i definitely like
02:52:55 okay i know that you said you don't want to meet comics people the reason why we got back on to
02:53:00 mary with like i don't think that he's your like way too like okay okay well okay let me repeat back
02:53:05 to you what i think that you want you just want to have cool people to talk to not you that you
02:53:10 need to talk to anyone for any amount of human substance like you need to talk to someone like
02:53:14 you want to have a good repertoire of friends that are nice whether or not they are comics people
02:53:19 is relevant is that the correct is that the situation here yeah sure sure isn't okay sounds
02:53:25 pretty good okay okay okay so the only reason who wouldn't want that agreed the only reason we got
02:53:30 back on the matter with mary whether is because uh we the idea of it would be the easiest like group
02:53:37 of people to communicate with because you share a thing in common but i do not think that's the only
02:53:42 way or like like i i didn't mean to like focus on like the mary weather angle as your like only
02:53:47 thing it just was one that asked you know i just i don't know i've never i've never like clicked
02:53:53 with another like web comics person in a way that's like oh let's like bond over the fact
02:53:58 that we both make a web comic or anything like that like that's just that's just never happens
02:54:04 and i i don't know i maybe that just says something about me uh no i mean there's nothing
02:54:12 like inherent about like liking the same thing as someone else that will make you like them i mean
02:54:16 like i was saying before that like you know i want to meet people who have the same interests
02:54:20 maybe that doesn't end like fadden stuff and that while it does like help like it doesn't go all the
02:54:24 way i don't know like okay i don't i don't think that you're doing anything wrong i don't think
02:54:29 that there's anything wrong happening here i don't know i guess you're right i guess you're
02:54:33 right that there's no like easy way to meet people and if you don't i mean that like there's not
02:54:39 i'm i'm i'm just like okay like like what is what is what is my ideal my ideal life my best life
02:54:49 i would say it differs from my current life and then i have like more and then i have like
02:54:56 more interactions with more people i have like a broader circle right it's not that i'm like
02:55:01 completely starved for like interactions entirely but like i don't know i i would want i would want
02:55:10 to like i would want to widen my circle but like in a in a in a natural way not in like a you're
02:55:20 searching for people way yeah i don't know well i mean i i don't think i don't know if anyone is
02:55:26 like i like searching i really hope i really god i'll be so fucking mad if this comes out and like
02:55:32 people listen to it and the takeaway is like oh ben's lonely oh we need to make we need to be his
02:55:36 friend oh guys let's let's like reach out to helping him let's go oh ben's up on his hill
02:55:41 he's up on his e or hill like looking up at like the sad clouds we gotta go we gotta go cheer him up
02:55:47 or something you know that's not i please please don't get that impression
02:55:56 i feel like this the way we the way we are talking about this just kind of naturally
02:56:00 frames me in like a in like a position of like lack and i don't even though i have like i have
02:56:08 like things that i feel like i could improve it's not that i'm like
02:56:13 totally bereft right i don't know you know you know what ben i i was misunderstanding you know i
02:56:20 i was bringing a lot of like my own like like what i was like i what i'm thinking about right
02:56:26 where like okay like i i saw that you like had a connection in like with a similar interest
02:56:33 and i latched on that because that's the sort of thing that i want but just because i
02:56:37 like him like like to me that would matter but i guess it wouldn't necessarily matter to anyone
02:56:41 else and so it seemed like the obvious solution of like well ben has this thing that i wish i had
02:56:46 so why doesn't he just do that because that's what i would do if i was in a scenario but like that
02:56:49 doesn't you know that doesn't mean anything that was just me that was just me coming in here but
02:56:57 do you want me to introduce you to mary weller no well not that specifically that idea i don't
02:57:01 want to i don't have any i have no beans there i don't even i've like never like heard mary
02:57:06 weller speak by the way i only know him as a name that you know i do not even know anything about him
02:57:11 there's a fire over there do you see that really do you fire up you see that yeah i see fire mountain
02:57:17 oh my god let's go find out what's happening over here i don't know where my home is by the way i got
02:57:22 lost i'm just been like traversing the minecraft world i mean whatever you don't have to go home
02:57:27 you just have to kill the the ender dragon yeah but i can't find where he is oh so the kkk's been
02:57:34 here they've been burning crosses oh must have been a lightning oh no the lava just like set trees
02:57:38 on fire why is there lava here that's just sometimes happens in the overworld we don't know why
02:57:44 um
02:57:51 all right what do you want munchie what's your what's your kokoro wish my kokoro wish
02:57:58 is i want to like i don't know i i'm of sort of two minds about it i sort of like want to like
02:58:05 kill myself and restart like not as like i kind of just want to like video game respond
02:58:11 i kind of just want to like have everything i want to like ghost like the world and like
02:58:15 disappear and then become like a like just like restart in a new like i want to pick up new language
02:58:21 and go to mexico and start up a new life um and what i and what i mean by that is as like
02:58:28 everything i'm doing right now just makes me sad and mad and i feel like i'm not in a good
02:58:33 headspace to engage with the things that i'm doing right now like being a personality and so i
02:58:37 want to i want to take a break from doing all of it uh like hardcore and just like stop and
02:58:42 not become an online man for a while and hone myself as like a human being to go train underneath the
02:58:47 waterfall um that's um that's not exactly what i was expecting but okay i mean i understand the whole
02:58:53 like not wanting to be a personality thing i get that what do you mean when you say that everything
02:58:59 you're doing now is making you mad what i mean what do you mean by everything what what i mean by
02:59:04 that is okay well you gotta understand that i have like very little of like a life especially like
02:59:10 i used to i was as growing one out but then quarantine happened so like right now my life
02:59:14 is simply that i am making things online and that i mean i sometimes play video games and yeah i am
02:59:21 waiting to create things and i have not stopped doing that but like all the things that i create
02:59:25 just kind of like bring me like sorrow like they just make things my life like i don't like it i
02:59:32 don't even think that's because like part of it is like the the like the inherent interactions
02:59:38 and like dynamic inherent with like having like a fan base and things like that which i i don't
02:59:42 want to seem ungrateful for but just like i don't know i've become i don't want to do that anymore
02:59:47 uh but like so so stuff like endless war right like i like making endless war a lot and i have a
02:59:52 lot of like plans and i want to do stuff with it but in certain ways like sometimes i'll come on to
02:59:57 endless war and i'll just be like man i want to kill myself reading reading the chat i want to kill
03:00:03 myself i hate what i hate living because i've read this comment in a like nurse's office or something
03:00:09 and i want to die now i don't want to be alive i don't know if you've noticed like i don't really
03:00:15 do a whole lot of that no i know and you're right and you're correct but i like i can't but i mean
03:00:21 that's sort of like i mean you appear as though you are farther away from this war as you do to
03:00:27 like the average player like people are like oh where's ben but like to me to anyone who knows you
03:00:32 it's obvious that you are like an endless warhead like greater than anyone you just will not stop
03:00:37 talking about it no matter what and you have like like this whole comic is like a huge part of your
03:00:41 like your personality as a human being alive on earth so it's like it's not like you left it i don't
03:00:48 um i just don't like i just don't okay like making endless war was cool and like i'm glad it exists
03:00:56 but i don't like i don't think i like engage with media in like a like an active way like i don't
03:01:06 know like when you talk about like being in a fandom the way you describe it is like maybe a little
03:01:14 different from how i would do it um like how would you describe that i was never really like when i
03:01:22 was in like the homestuck fandom i was never like i was never like out there like engaging and like
03:01:30 i wasn't like meeting people through it i wasn't like forming like connections with people i was
03:01:35 just like soaking up like fan creations and like reading like reddit posts and like just like reading
03:01:42 about it and like thinking about it all the time and maybe like drawing a thing related to it if i was
03:01:49 feeling really saucy that day so like endless war it's like um like i don't what i'm saying is i would
03:02:01 definitely be if i was like just a normal rfck head i would be i would be i would not be a gameplay
03:02:08 guy i'd get all i would be like all i would just only be an art guy i would only be like i wouldn't
03:02:14 even be like an active poster or anything i would probably just like show up having made a thing
03:02:19 like drop it in the chat and then like leave right um yeah that's and like that's kind of what i
03:02:30 i can i kind of continue that proud tradition in the way that i interact with endless war
03:02:37 to this day i mean i don't want to feel say like make it seem like i'm like a social butterfly
03:02:43 and fandom since like if like if i'm in the same like community as someone else like i know everyone
03:02:47 i talk to everyone or anything most of it is like lurking but like with brony stuff like
03:02:52 i would like be in the community i would read those reddit posts and i would know what's
03:02:56 happening in the show and then i'd be like okay i'm gonna draw some fan art and then i draw some
03:03:00 fan art people would comment like hey i like your art too you want to be friends and they would
03:03:04 say yes i'm also 12 and i'd be like cool let's hang out and then they would say okay and then
03:03:09 that's how like i i i really do see like fandom as like like an excuse to meet people which i guess
03:03:17 is not the the case for you i had i had i had like zero interaction with like any other bronies
03:03:25 before i started before tbap well i mean yeah i mean i think creation is like a central part of
03:03:33 this equation where it's like you are inspired to create via the fandom and that's how you meet
03:03:37 people is through each other's art of said thing it just it like it like it gives you a tag to
03:03:43 search on twitter like that's the appeal yeah um you know i think maybe for a while i thought i would
03:03:51 like i would i would like search like um bernie tags and stuff on twitter i would like search
03:03:58 like i would like follow like other accounts that have like roses in their name and stuff yeah
03:04:03 i was like here like um why don't i fucking make like why don't i build like a fucking good like
03:04:07 socialist circle of like friends or whatever but like i don't know it again like i wasn't like
03:04:15 i mean i would occasionally reply to people's posts but it all just it all felt very it all
03:04:20 felt very superficial it all felt like it wasn't really building anything um it was just like kind
03:04:29 of just a way to like i would just end up getting frustrated like i would just just read lots of
03:04:36 posts that but that may be mad like followed a bunch of people i would read their posts they
03:04:41 would make me mad or i would just not care and scroll by them a while back like last week i
03:04:47 like unfollowed a bunch of people that i had followed who were like that because like i don't
03:04:52 i don't need to be following this person yeah there's no actual yeah i'm not learning anything
03:04:57 um i'm not accomplishing anything uh so i don't know that was like another another another failure
03:05:06 i guess i i mean i don't want to make it seem like i it's easier like i like i tried like i
03:05:11 was saying before like i tried to do a sort of thing with history but like it didn't work out
03:05:15 i i think i i think when it's not well okay there's a thousand factors in it but like when it's
03:05:21 not like a show right when it's like a historical or like it's a political thing like i think that
03:05:25 i think that's like the cutoff point where it's like okay this is officially too big of a fandom
03:05:30 if you can even be called that to the point where it loses it's like luster of like diverse enough
03:05:35 but also like small enough where it's it's close knit enough where you can meet people and it's easy
03:05:40 i feel like it loses it's like cohesion as like a group like i feel like
03:05:44 i feel like bernie twitter is like too unwieldy of like an entity where it's like yeah i don't
03:05:50 think you could just like search bernie and get like people who you would be able to vibe with
03:05:55 i see like i see like people that i subscribe to on youtube like replying to each other's tweets
03:06:02 and stuff and i'm thinking like man i kind of wish i had something like that but like but why
03:06:08 i don't really i don't know it just seems like it seems like they're they're bonding over like
03:06:14 their shared beliefs which seems like as good a thing to bond over as any yeah and like but i don't
03:06:19 like i don't know i don't make like quippy like observational posts i just make like angry
03:06:31 screams when i when i like state my opinions and it's not i don't think i do it in the right way
03:06:39 to like get that kind of a thing of like a rapport going with people
03:06:48 so i don't know here's i guess that's something i'm jealous of here's like i guess like the point
03:06:54 of friendship for me if i wanted to like analyze it like my purely in my in my right brain lumarian
03:07:00 point of view is like the point is that i can have someone that we can like hang out and have fun
03:07:06 and number one first of all we can like you know enjoy each other but also that we're able to like
03:07:11 communicate and like advance each other in in well whatever way that could mean at the time
03:07:17 whether it be like you know we just advance an idea where it's like hey did you hear about this
03:07:21 yeah i heard about that here's what i think here's what i think about that i'm glad that i heard your
03:07:24 opinion because that's very interesting to me or it's like you know we we fucking we're gonna
03:07:29 draw every day and if you don't post in this discord server that i made then i'll kill you like
03:07:34 you know in a more like literal sort of advancement but like in some way i want to like have people
03:07:42 that like get it in whatever way that means and then i can talk to you about it and then continue
03:07:48 my further my further thought on it if you know what i mean okay i see makes makes sense i'm gonna
03:07:59 get a wolf please be my friend wolf you know he's my friend he's my friend oh you gave it a bone
03:08:05 yes oh very nice how epic is that i didn't know there were wolves in minecraft that's a that's
03:08:12 yeah you can make them be your dog dude are they new there no they've been around for like several
03:08:18 years like before it was officially released like when not like notch added dogs oh weird okay
03:08:28 they came around with cookies they were adding the same update that cookies were updated cool okay
03:08:35 um i feel like what were we saying that got us on this we were saying something about want
03:08:45 um what did we're talking about what we wanted to talk like
03:08:50 oh i mean i mean how far back are we how far back are we going i don't know i don't the whole thing
03:08:56 has just been a stream of consciousness it has i love the stream my consciousness is my favorite
03:09:02 streamer hey here's the best you you got to go pee i need to pee too i'll be back that's fine
03:09:09 what's up guys what do you what do you think about oh god why am i asking you what you think
03:09:14 about you see this is the sort of thing god okay i i come across as so fucking bad when i talk about
03:09:20 things like this one it's like oh i don't want to be personality haha oh having a fan base is so
03:09:24 bad but like i've never i should like have a podcast where i explain what i mean by that
03:09:28 because i don't mean like i'm like oh the though the the fucking hardships of fame is so fucking
03:09:33 hard you know like i don't mean like that or like i you know taking the heat is like so difficult
03:09:39 when you're at the level that i'm at which is to say nothing and i have like 20 fans like i don't
03:09:45 simply what i mean okay okay i'm gonna say it really simply i think that personality driven
03:09:51 shows are boring and i think that they're stuck like dumb and i think that they suck and i don't
03:09:56 like making them because i think that they're bad and so oh god skeleton and so what i mean when i
03:10:01 don't want to become like a personality is i don't want to be like a youtuber i i seem like
03:10:05 really hoi-du-toi-di and like oh god like you know you fucking you're selling out you're making
03:10:10 canton law epic simply what i mean by that is that i wish that i was making more like
03:10:17 stuff that i perceived to be good like you know like like a like a i just want to throw out there
03:10:23 like a like a comic or just like an animation or something something that felt like it wasn't the
03:10:27 sole appeal of it wasn't that it was just me and i want to make a thing that can stand on its own
03:10:31 and i because i think that that's better and that's what i mean by that audience i hope you
03:10:35 enjoy this intermission okay i'm back i i talk such mad shit about you been here i'm gonna
03:10:42 believe the audience will know about how i told them about your onion breath and your toes and
03:10:48 your feet yeah oh no your bunions your bunions oh my god you'll they'll know all about your mad
03:10:55 bunions i don't know what those are i know there's something you get on your foot they're like i think
03:11:00 they're like a callous sort of semi-ward i believe like a ward out of callous feet fibers
03:11:08 oh no it's like in your bone oh pain and stiffness in the big toe a bony bump that forms on the
03:11:18 joint i've got a bony bump for you of the big toe oh jeez yeah i thought it was like a ward yeah
03:11:25 oh god oh no the picture is like it's like a big like gray like lump in between like the your
03:11:33 toe bones oh god why why well okay now i know watch out for those i will i will get them as soon
03:11:47 as possible sir what where do you where do you want to discuss i don't know i think i think
03:11:54 we're winding down we've been going on for like a few hours i feel like i feel like we're winding
03:11:58 down i don't feel like we solved anything or arrived at any like new truths well what's there
03:12:06 to discover i guess i mean we're just talking about things and trying to come to a greater i mean

03:13:28 they were like deserts in this game what are they're not deserts i mean there are but like i've
03:13:33 just been going through mountains and plains like over and over and over again dude where's the ender
03:13:41 i'm trying to find him bro it's hard it's hard okay you gotta pound the pavement i know i well
03:13:48 here get married weather online maybe i'll know where the other dragon you know hey maybe you
03:13:51 get married weather like you're welcome i can't come in contact with the nether dragon real quick
03:13:56 please do you hey i actually was wondering if like the nether dragon would want to be on like a podcast
03:14:01 i'm starting two best brothers bitch about politics actually i hear some really black
03:14:08 pill that takes because he's black because he's a dragon get it
03:14:14 can we agree on something dragons don't have fur they have scales can we agree on this
03:14:20 well i mean is that like is that in contention yeah mammalian dragons big contention i mean
03:14:29 i mean yeah i mean it wouldn't i don't i mean if i mean whatever it's a fantasy creature who
03:14:38 knows maybe there are like mutants that have fur i don't know i do i do feel like if it's got fur
03:14:43 then it's a mammal and like dragons are a reptilian it would just be like a mammal that
03:14:50 happens to resemble a dragon in shape yeah so yeah i guess i'm with you i guess i'm with you on that
03:14:56 god god no this is so terrible my dog can get hit by my own screechy scratches this is terrible
03:15:04 oh not the screechy scratches i know with the diamond sword but how does he feel about your
03:15:09 crisscrosses even worse he bowed out painfully at that oh sad we have arrived no more truths
03:15:22 no i didn't we haven't learned anything i didn't learn anything oh zombie well i learned that
03:15:32 dogs are double edged sword in Minecraft because they'll help you kill people but maybe they'll
03:15:37 die one day too that's what we learned today everyone that's i hope you're glad you enjoyed
03:15:44 though the the lesson is don't get a dog in Minecraft it'll just die and leave you bereft
03:15:52 it'll just suck up all your it'll just absorb all the arrows that you're shooting
03:15:58 sad and riddled with guilt what's his name um
03:16:08 didorian epic his name is dory like my favorite Nemo character
03:16:15 uh oh dude i caught a um i caught a dory in uh yeah in animal crossing yeah i did
03:16:24 it was based i got like 3000 bells for it uh i'm gonna check my oh hey wait wait no no no no no
03:16:34 storm before the storm we have to we are obligated by the company to mention it oh yeah that's right
03:16:41 um we we read it at some point um and yeah okay correct me if i'm wrong haven't i read it
03:16:49 before the last one yes okay and i don't think did you reread it again no okay
03:17:01 okay okay well there is nothing there's nothing to like talk about because you i mean there's nothing
03:17:07 that you found like found that interesting correct or that you really cared about that much i i thought
03:17:14 that what was interesting was just all the times in history where like basically just an angry mob
03:17:23 decided what the rules were oh yeah that's like every revolution ever that's that's the coolest
03:17:29 part of every revolution yeah it's just like if if like the government or like some politician like
03:17:35 fucked around and and found that they would find out because like either some other like
03:17:41 a powerful person would lead like his like clan out into the streets or just like the general
03:17:47 population would like fucking revolt and just like threaten murder and like to destroy to
03:17:52 like tear the whole fucking thing down and the government would be like uh uh uh okay uh no
03:17:58 actually no we were wrong uh the rules say we do this other thing so yep sorry everyone don't worry
03:18:04 about it and it was that's that's the biggest takeaway from it there was a top so Mike Duncan the
03:18:12 creator of uh that book as well as my favorite podcast series revolutions and the history of
03:18:18 Rome uh is is a historic or a gruffer man and he was at a top did i i want to mention that i just
03:18:24 happened to see someone retweet him like um i think i think just like saying lol or like laughing at
03:18:33 someone else's tweet saying that like um the grain doll uh was like what ended Rome or something
03:18:38 yeah well uh when he like extensively lines out about how that's not the case um um and it's epic
03:18:46 but uh so i really like his stuff and so he has a talk where he talks about this book and about
03:18:52 like why he made it and he made it because he like like you know he uh felt that it was analogous
03:19:01 in a way to like what current like political climate was and i thought it was interesting
03:19:06 and he sort of touches that and then on like the like the beginning of the book where he talks about
03:19:12 like i remember him saying that like we're not living in like the end times but like we might
03:19:19 be living in like the lead up to the end times yeah uh and i thought yeah i thought that was
03:19:25 interesting and that's that's the sort of like that's the sort of reason why i wanted i thought
03:19:29 it'd be a cool introductory so this was all part of my long game like we were talking about earlier
03:19:33 where it's like dude what have been really like storm before the storm and then he's like hey
03:19:37 munchie what other sort of things kind of listen to him like haha well been you see and then i would
03:19:41 pull out my big long list of things uh that you can watch and then we would be friends and it'd be great
03:19:47 but that didn't happen now that was a pipe dream yeah unfortunately but but i also thought that you
03:19:54 would like it because it was about you know current political stuff and and what uh societal unrest
03:20:01 would lead to something i did like a lot of it i just had a hard time like remembering which
03:20:07 person had which name yeah i mean roman names are very like everyone has like the same first name
03:20:13 yeah yeah it was a little bit of a challenge pumpkin this is so weird i don't this is like
03:20:21 a mod that used to be in the game where it's like you can see recipes now it's like a real thing
03:20:24 that just everyone can do i don't know if i like it um but we don't have to like my special anymore
03:20:31 no we don't have to talk about it for too long because i you know there's no reason to talk about
03:20:34 but i just want to mention it because we said the bigger need to talk about it on the podcast
03:20:40 last time we said like book club yeah but i just i didn't want to reuse again i read a bunch of other
03:20:48 books instead i read a bunch of david graver you want to talk about graver then you can talk about
03:20:54 graver well what which ones have you read so far i read um uh debts i read um the one that's got
03:21:03 like democracy in the title of the democracy movement or the democracy project or something
03:21:09 something like it's something like i know it's about him and the one in the wall street i know
03:21:13 you're talking about yeah dude i love that one was sick i don't know what you think about that one
03:21:18 okay that one was um it wasn't as interesting as debt no sure but it was like it was very different
03:21:27 it was like i felt like guilty reading it because like occupy wall street was not that long ago
03:21:33 but like i already had like forgotten like about it yeah it feels like ancient history
03:21:39 but like it like just happened and it's like feels like something that could like very easily
03:21:45 happen again and i kind of feel like i should have like supported it back when it was happening
03:21:54 yeah well so it was very like weird because okay my experience with david graver was not like like
03:22:00 i like i found out after like i google searched more about him that he was like apparently like
03:22:04 this like anarchist anthropologist i had no idea i just got him debt because i heard it was a good
03:22:09 book and i read it and i was like oh cool book epic um oh he's another book on honorable i'll check
03:22:14 it out democracy whatever okay i'll put on this apparently he's like you know like he was one of
03:22:18 the like the creators of occupy wall street and i was like whoa what i had no idea i had no idea
03:22:22 this was a thing and all like the coolest thing about this was like that shock of like dude this guy
03:22:28 who's smart is also like a weird like political activist that's like epic and awesome um but the
03:22:33 coolest part about it for me was like hearing all like the weird like practical advice and like the
03:22:39 blow by blows like what it's like being in one of those like occupy wall street like tent city
03:22:43 sort of things and like hearing about like the general assemblies about how like how do you like
03:22:50 run a group with like anarchist ideals that also has to have like structure in it so that it can
03:22:55 produce anything of merit um and it was really cool about like the structures in place for like
03:23:01 voting about the general assembly like there was this long die tribe like chapters long discussion
03:23:07 about like how do you vote do you vote by like majority or do you vote by consistency like how
03:23:11 do you like which do you do when do you do it and stuff like that it's like interesting cool um so
03:23:17 like hearing like the practical advice of like someone who i respect who's also part of this
03:23:22 like you know occupy wall street which like i basically didn't even like i had the vaguest
03:23:26 conceptions of it i knew like we are the 99 percent that's all i knew and it's like it's cool
03:23:31 hearing about it um because like i totally passed by totally completely yeah whoa whoa what the
03:23:38 fuck is that shit oh my god oh my god there's fucking scary people i don't what do you wear
03:23:47 over there over there's a banner you can see their banner what are they like bandits yeah they're
