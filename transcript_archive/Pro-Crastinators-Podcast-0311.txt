00:00:00 I want to bless that guy. That's on above!
00:00:11 OK, I'm gonna sync with myself. One, two, three, sync!
00:00:18 Hello everyone. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:22 It's me, the Gibbontake.
00:00:24 I, it's a solo Gipcast, at least for the beginning, um, I've waited, I've waited for an hour and
00:00:32 a half for Ben's internet to work suddenly and it's not suddenly working.
00:00:37 So I'm doing it, I'm doing the solo Gipcast, I don't know if this has happened before,
00:00:43 I know I've uploaded like a solo, like a vlogcast or something a long time ago just talking
00:00:51 about what I do, but that wasn't a PCP episode.
00:00:55 I think this is maybe the first Procrastinator's podcast where only I have appeared.
00:01:02 So, uh, what you, what you doing, um, I should start with, I think, the Lord of Ghosts, uh,
00:01:13 thank you for people who have, uh, since the last episode sent me their addresses, there's
00:01:19 only seven people left who haven't responded in any way, uh, to emails, to, uh, public
00:01:25 callouts, uh, uh, so I'm gonna read those names one more time and I'll probably be sending
00:01:32 these at the end of April and if there's anyone left, I'll just deal with it, uh, when it,
00:01:39 when it comes.
00:01:40 So, the last people, and I may have spoken to these people, but I still haven't got the
00:01:46 addresses in my, like, spreadsheet, so, uh, if you have responded, uh, this may not apply
00:01:52 anymore, but as of recording, uh, Mimi Menzies, Oren, O-R-I-N, James Gottwig, Adam O'Donnell,
00:02:02 D.S., James Dollar, and Milo Rocks.
00:02:06 James Dollar and Milo Rocks are actually, like, high pledge people, they, they give
00:02:12 a big pledge, I have to draw a doodle for them, I think, maybe they get in the plush,
00:02:16 uh, so, you know, Jed, give the address, go to the, go to the Kickstarter, if you can't
00:02:24 remember your Kickstarter account, then just message me somewhere, uh, so that I know,
00:02:30 and that's that, that's my little thing, but yeah, that's, that's been fun, the Lord of
00:02:35 Ghosts, it's almost completely finished in terms of the Kickstarter thing, and I think,
00:02:42 I think I've learned quite a lot, I've learned, um, that I should, like, very thoroughly figure
00:02:50 out exactly how heavy all of the items I'm going to make will be, I think I did ballpark
00:02:56 figures for, like, the number of pages I would probably, I would have, and then, like, the
00:03:01 page thickness, and, like, how much that would probably weigh, and I got, like, a rough estimate,
00:03:06 but it was very far off, uh, correct, and it wasn't enough, uh, so, luckily, the Kickstarter
00:03:15 made enough money that I'm not, like, losing money, overall, um, I may, like, not, I may,
00:03:23 like, break just even because of, like, all the customs bullshit, which is, uh, unavoidable,
00:03:29 but, uh, what are you going to do? Um, yeah, I've learned a lot about how to do that,
00:03:38 and it was, it really just comes down to, like, make sure to, to know exactly what the
00:03:44 costs are before you set the price for, for, um, for shipping to various countries. I thought,
00:03:51 like, oh, America, and, like, Australia, they'll be similar, and no, Australia's far more expensive.
00:03:58 And, uh, it's Farmerx, but, oh, is that Ben St. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You appeared. I messaged
00:04:08 you a minute ago. Oh, and there's, there's oblivion fall as well. Oh, hey. The episode
00:04:19 has already begun. I just, I basically just gave my spiel. Uh, give, give, give, give,
00:04:24 give, give, give, gimme five, five minutes, since you messaged me. I was waiting for a
00:04:29 whole extra half hour after the hour, you initially said. Let's wait.
00:04:33 I s- I, I said like an hour. I said like an hour and, uh-
00:04:39 Look, I, all I did was I said the Lord of Ghosts, like, people who still haven't given
00:04:43 their addresses and that's it. So that's fine. You can just leave that in.
00:04:46 Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, you're right. It's fine. I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in a rotten
00:04:53 mood this morning why so rotten I don't know if I even want to talk about it to

00:07:07 oblivion I'm doing yeah I've just been for the past week plus a couple days I've
00:07:18 just been watching my patreon explode yeah explode I saw it the day after that
00:07:25 video went up I haven't checked it in a little while let me take a look at it
00:07:30 I'll just show what it's at today oh wow it's insane it doubled like a whole thing it
00:07:39 doubled again yeah it's fucking I saw it like doubled the day the video went up
00:07:45 and then it did it like again okay yeah it was at 400 and now it's at 3500 wow
00:07:54 that's which that congrats that's a lot yeah I'm just I'm just speechless I'm
00:08:03 speechless I've been making animations on YouTube for up close to 15 years and
00:08:10 this is the first time I can officially say it's it's me I've done it I've made
00:08:16 it I'm independent boy not having to rely on doing animation forever people it's
00:08:23 the power of the big booby and so I'm very happy yes I guess damn well not to
00:08:32 demean not to diminish the fact that it was a very good animation that got all
00:08:35 that attention because it was very nice what can I say 900 it's a big number what's
00:08:46 what's your next like animation then what's what's what are all these patrons
00:08:51 gonna gonna be waiting for the next project is come zone for I have I mean
00:09:01 I've been working on the instrumental since the beginning of last year I've
00:09:04 just writer's block is bad and also I've had so much other things to focus on that
00:09:10 I haven't really been able to properly sit down and you know dedicate a lot of
00:09:14 time to it until now but yeah like it's going well I'm making my own music
00:09:20 instead of stealing from infected mushroom that's nice I actually really
00:09:25 really like how it's sounding so far and once it's done I'll be like storyboarding
00:09:30 and figuring stuff out the plan is to work on the shots one at a time and a lot
00:09:38 of a shots I know it's gonna be at least one part of the video where it's just a
00:09:42 whole bunch of sex happening but for the YouTube version it'll just be like
00:09:46 silhouettes with like you know like quickly cutting in and out with like
00:09:51 the music and it'll just be like a you know a black silhouette with like a red
00:09:54 or white thing around that or something but I'll basically be working on those
00:10:00 shots and releasing them for patreon so that way they can get like as they're
00:10:07 as you're as they're getting you're gonna release the pieces of the video as
00:10:13 you finish the pieces yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then eventually you know
00:10:19 the whole all of bits will be done and I can combine it all and there'll be like
00:10:23 obviously non-sexo shots as well and maybe some art in between though like
00:10:29 considering how much people respond to the animation like I was planning to do a
00:10:33 lot more art but people seem to really care about the animation mostly so I
00:10:36 guess that's where I'll focus I'm still gonna spend next month mostly drawing
00:10:42 but I do have some content I can release that like I'm gonna make a I'm
00:10:48 probably gonna make like an NSFW version of come zone free I'm just gonna you
00:10:54 know take the After Effects file that I had take the Photoshop file for all the
00:10:59 layers and shit and just we got no put take your titties out I guess is that
00:11:04 not something I thought that's I thought you already had that I thought that was
00:11:09 what was on patreon no that's like sitting in a chair it's like the first
00:11:14 one oh three that's three yeah okay gotcha yeah the yeah come zone free was
00:11:21 for one that blew up like in 2020 yeah the new animation is on Kazonex come
00:11:27 zone and then comes on for the thing I'm doing next what what qualifies what
00:11:37 disqualifies on Kazonex come zone from being number four is it that it's a is
00:11:42 it that it's a meme crossover it's that it's short probably that it's short it
00:11:50 doesn't have lyrics okay the musical style is very different from the over
00:11:55 free whereas the fourth one will be more in line with that and way better I think
00:12:00 what I have so far is way better like it's musically some of the best stuff I've
00:12:04 made ever in my life and I don't know I think mainly it's like the lyrics being
00:12:13 a thing because that's what cracks everyone up gets everyone giggling me I
00:12:20 see me I see could we get Craig in here sure oh yeah also we should say oh
00:12:27 right yes maybe I just maybe I just like being on the show you know maybe I
00:12:34 just like to be here you think about that what maybe that's why I'm on
00:12:44 even though I'm paying for data well yeah I mean maybe I just enjoy it
00:12:50 I appreciate your company same to you Ben
00:13:02 I'm losing it I'm losing it this morning all right let's let's sync quickly and
00:13:08 so we can get that out of the way yes yeah okay one two three sink sink let's
00:13:15 go let's keep going that was the coldest open ever what were we talking
00:13:19 about comes on for yeah it's gonna be a thing did you you how I mean you didn't
00:13:31 you didn't expect it to like quit quintuple but do you expect it to quintuple
00:13:36 again after it comes on for there's a chance look I did my research right yeah
00:13:45 because I'm like I like doing animation there's a lot of different kinds of
00:13:49 animation I'd like to do but I am like primarily a degenerate I feel okay and
00:13:58 that tends to like succeed so that that's good for me but I don't know like
00:14:01 how well it'll do so I did like see like whatever people have done in order to
00:14:07 um you know make a living like I looked at some of the page like the most highest
00:14:13 earning patrons the patreon people and there's people like Sakimichan who
00:14:19 like $60,000 a month and they just do art like they like people like that have
00:14:26 like such an insane reach like their art just gets posted a million times on
00:14:32 every website everywhere like do people yeah like outside of like you know like
00:14:39 like mainstream like I look at hentai porn circles like for some reason has
00:14:43 like reached beyond that I don't know they make like a ridiculous amount of
00:14:49 money and they always have and I'm like okay but that seems to be like a fluke
00:14:54 though like most NSFW artists like will make a couple hundred or maybe a couple
00:15:01 thousand but never like a crazy amount like it seems to be a fluke in that case
00:15:07 Sakimichan is a weird anomaly yeah for sure yeah um and like they're a good
00:15:14 artist but like this better artist definitely they definitely have I don't
00:15:22 know if it's still a problem they had same face for a very long time who's
00:15:25 Sakimi yes Sakimichan yeah I mean Sakimi is like a good painter whatever yeah
00:15:33 they're not like 20 times better than everyone else and you know like she
00:15:39 has very good rendering her anatomy can definitely be noticeably off frequently
00:15:45 but yeah but like it's not like not to like a terrible degree it's just like yeah
00:15:51 the people who like I don't know how Sakimichan got to where they are are
00:15:57 never seeing their shit like posted by like news articles hey this person drew
00:16:00 Disney princesses is hot men and you just see like fucking BuzzFeed articles and shit like
00:16:04 that kind of attention yeah so like I yeah not gonna happen to me and also I
00:16:11 can't like that that semi-realism that gets people wet is not something I'm
00:16:17 into anyway but what I have seen as I've seen animators like fucking go from
00:16:22 small number to ridiculously huge number that's like the tens of thousands
00:16:26 very fast and it seems to mostly happen with animators it happens with yeah
00:16:34 there has to be exclusive content yeah just be an animator have exclusive
00:16:40 content and like be good right the primary thing like some I see like some
00:16:49 really like big artists who you're talking about NSFW specifically yeah
00:16:53 like yeah porn mainly yeah like and they're they're animators who you know
00:16:59 don't do NSFW who are just as talented or more talented than me who get like not
00:17:04 even a hundred a month it's sad I just just how though just how things be but
00:17:10 yeah like I looked at I forgot the website's called it's like a it's like
00:17:15 social blade but for patreon you can track how much people have earned over
00:17:18 time I looked at some high-earning animators you're talking about graph
00:17:22 trian graph trian yeah that was it I know I'm gonna see on that graph trian
00:17:29 actually I wanted to look at um Trixie's graph trian it's great I know I want to
00:17:38 know what was fair maximum earnings and almost 5k almost 5k okay so I've got a
00:17:46 while ago before I beat that record actually let me let me uh actually let
00:17:54 me look at your graph here oh wow oh wow yeah I actually haven't looked at my own
00:18:05 graph it's really funny wait I'll post it don't look don't look it's gonna be
00:18:10 in the crowd I can't find myself that's weird lol oh my god it's like a
00:18:23 waterfall in reverse that is mad oh my god and the trajectory is still going up
00:18:33 that's probably am I it's probably gonna skim close to 4k I mean
00:18:40 depends how long this this gravy train keeps chugging along I'm pying to just
00:18:48 keep the output good yeah that that that puts things into perspective yeah
00:18:57 apparently number one in the adult music rank there's an adult music rank see
00:19:06 that does seem like a pretty a pretty small niche oh yeah I didn't even know
00:19:12 those thing like how is this cataclysm wait rock candies in here I know who
00:19:18 that person is candy they're they're they're like an they're like an ad they
00:19:24 do like flash animations um let's see this person well yeah you you became
00:19:31 number one in adult music on April 22nd or no April yeah or April yep yep wow
00:19:39 huh that's interesting like I'm looking at some of these like the rankings for
00:19:45 top-patreon adult music not ever not I know all of these people like seem to
00:19:51 have like music listed as like a thing they do at least in there like you know
00:19:54 very little description like I guess mindgasm creates audio guides I don't
00:20:03 know what an audio guide is is that music Orion the Orion person says they
00:20:09 create music videos huh yeah audio guides for meditation
00:20:17 oh maybe it includes music the people at the bottom like have music but the
00:20:23 people never top don't mention music that's interesting except me I'm
00:20:28 authentic Lamau yeah yeah you're the best sex music person that they've ever
00:20:37 seen cunt and the gang creating silly music and other content for enlightened
00:20:44 ear holes I'm interested jinx monsoon creating gorgeous little things I don't
00:20:53 even know what some of these are but cosplay music videos okay it's a real a
00:21:01 real a real but what do you call it mishmash a real melting pot this this
00:21:05 category hmm number one though pretty good you beat you just barely beat out
00:21:13 golden tar who is creating sketches and stories also does not sound like music
00:21:20 but oh well interesting the money and the money you show me the money the money
00:21:27 though that's pretty good hmm I'm gonna be able to at this rate we're gonna be
00:21:35 able to afford kai's top surgery in a couple months and then all so we're just
00:21:40 saving up for that right now and after that I'm just gonna have a lot of extra
00:21:44 money I'm just gonna use it to hire people I guess hire help hire animators
00:21:50 and you know be able to get more good plug-ins for my music hire a
00:21:55 professional mixer that sort of thing hmm I'm gonna put it on yeah you know I'll
00:22:06 be curious yeah I I guess I would be curious to hear like what you how you
00:22:14 do that I don't know like what like what would you yeah outsource like that
00:22:19 mixing maybe like what do you call it like a fit finish finishing like a what
00:22:29 would you call it when like you have the rough sketches of an animation and you
00:22:32 send it off to a Korean studio and they and they send it back and usually you
00:22:37 send the key frames key yeah yeah in-betweening in-betweening it's not
00:22:47 quite the best analogy like with mixing it's like you know I'm no no I'm not
00:22:52 saying they're the same I'm just wondering if I don't know you would do
00:22:56 something like that oh if I would do something like that for animation I mean
00:23:00 way round I would get someone I would pay people to do rough animation for
00:23:06 I'd really them to do like a sketchy version and then I would clean it up
00:23:10 because that's my area of stress really are you serious yeah it's you use that's
00:23:18 crazy I'm bad at the fundamentals but I'm extremely doing micro adjustments
00:23:27 like I'd probably at this point I can probably like I can do like rough
00:23:32 storyboards and then I maybe I can find like so an artist you can like really
00:23:35 push him like get more like intense perspective and things to make it just
00:23:39 look really cool sort of thing so like better storyboarding rough animations I
00:23:48 there's a couple people I've talked to who said they would be interested who are
00:23:51 really good and now I can like pay like here I'll give you like like 150 bucks
00:23:59 to do like like like a shot that's like five seconds or something and if just
00:24:07 roughs you know which I think is pretty good rates you know that's that's kind
00:24:13 of what I'm thinking and hopefully hopefully comes before be really good
00:24:17 but it's still gonna take a while to get done sure I mean you laugh about like it
00:24:24 being oblivion is not good at the fundamentals then but I think like people
00:24:31 have their skills sometimes that just is how it is where you're like I don't know
00:24:36 I look at a blank page and I like some people can just sketch out like a rough
00:24:40 idea really easy and really quickly and other people like they they just can't
00:24:48 and they can only like refine something that already exists with with like a
00:24:54 like a fine-toothed comb yeah skill sets it's all it's all depending on because
00:25:01 like I was trying for like pumpkin alley stuff to like to like do concept art I've
00:25:07 never really done concept art in my head I know what the game looks like roughly
00:25:12 enough I'm like yeah this is this kind of level and it's like this and I have to
00:25:17 like I can't just say it I have to make images so that it can be like so that
00:25:23 when I give it to Charlie he knows like what sort of models to make and what
00:25:27 color they need to be and stuff like that and concept art sucks I don't know how
00:25:33 to do it I don't know how to like just bring something out in like a in like a
00:25:38 quick and quick and dirty like just because if because in my head it seems
00:25:44 so obvious like what it looks like I was like why would I need to draw it I just
00:25:50 say it's like it looks like this I have to draw it and it's like it's difficult
00:25:55 it's weird Ryan some sometimes things be difficult sometimes they true yeah yeah
00:26:08 like with me I on occasion when I go to sketch something it'll just turn out
00:26:16 pretty good the first try most of a time it's bad I have to fight I have to fight
00:26:22 my sketch after fight my sketch for hours and get a bunch of opinions and
00:26:26 then I can sort of coax it in a direction that's good and then maybe I'll
00:26:31 polish it up but they'll still it'll still have a lot of problems and the more
00:26:36 I work and the more I just hate it yeah I'm definitely not great at drawing
00:26:43 still like I can get a good drawing eventually but it takes way too much
00:26:47 fighting at the moment compared to other artists I see who and then like five
00:26:51 minutes I'll just have something that looks great something out yeah I'm like
00:26:54 what the fuck how did you do that a lot of people in the draw cast server are
00:26:59 like like phenomenal and they just like yeah they're just like making like
00:27:05 masterpiece sketches within the time limit of a draw cast I'm like fuck I
00:27:12 also feel that the longer I work on something usually the less good I
00:27:18 think it is yeah it's funny cuz cuz the reason it takes a long time is cuz
00:27:24 you're like you're I mean usually it's cuz like your sketch was your sketch was
00:27:29 was not great and then you're building on a you're building on like a an incomplete
00:27:34 or an unpolished foundation and then you just kind of got a like well the face
00:27:41 kind of like is it supposed to be here no that's not right this pose I'm getting
00:27:48 if I move the arm will it look a little bit no it still sucks that's what it
00:27:54 takes long long time that's it's bad there's been a few people who have seen
00:28:01 throughout my life who are like born illustrators and like doesn't matter how
00:28:07 old they are they just sort of are really good at like making an image really
00:28:12 well but they always hate their work and they're always talking about how it
00:28:16 sucks I'm like this you yeah insult me by saying that it's so annoying yeah
00:28:23 cuz I feel bad than what am I yeah yeah yeah I yeah some people some people some
00:28:35 people just can't take a compliment some people you'll tell them like oh this is
00:28:39 a really good drawing and they'll be like no it's bad it sucks you you have
00:28:44 shitty taste if you think my stuff is good you idiot yeah for forays is always
00:28:52 like fat a little bit not not to not in the annoying way like he'll just let's
00:28:56 kill him he'll just sit down like just throw some lines down and like it'll be
00:29:01 these really nice like shapes that have like really good like appeal and look
00:29:05 really good I'm like whoa that's really cool and he's like what the fuck you
00:29:09 talk about I just this is just some garbage I made I'm like it's good you
00:29:13 know yeah I do that as well sometimes it's not I don't I'm not proud of that I
00:29:19 do sometimes like draw and it's like yeah I can see that this has you know
00:29:24 potential this has some good stuff you've done some really but I'm not yeah I
00:29:30 don't I don't know how to judge my own work and so when I'm in a bad mood or if
00:29:36 I feel like a futile today oh it's all it's never gonna work out doesn't matter
00:29:43 how good I'm actually drawing and how much people are saying oh wow Pog it's
00:29:46 like just another day of being Gib being like the not good one just another
00:29:55 day being Gib so tragic just a little Gib in a big wide terrifying world
00:30:07 you know twi-pi drew just to twi-pi drew that that Virginia and then they they
00:30:17 they sent it as a voicemail on the last episode and it was great they didn't
00:30:22 tweeted at me so I could retweet it though those those and it's those those
00:30:27 Virginia having sex paintings they were so good the crutch tip it wasn't sent as
00:30:34 a voicemail I sent it in voice chat for oh right that's that's right but the
00:30:40 point is we did show it yeah yeah I I censored it so that LA's are could have
00:30:47 something to put on screen I don't know if you saw the censored version I did I
00:30:53 did went back and looked at the episode of that part you know if they're on if
00:31:04 they're even on Twitter maybe they're not I'll I'll ask Twi if she'll post them
00:31:08 at the time she said like I don't know if I'll post them actually and I'm like
00:31:12 okay but like maybe you should I thought they were worthy they were good they're
00:31:19 on a family trip when they get back I'll bully them I see oh wait maybe maybe
00:31:25 over time this episode's out did you you did you ever post that that video I
00:31:30 think it was a you would four eyes reacting to the yes I didn't see that
00:31:35 but I'll I I want to find your server I'm sorry I must have missed it but it's
00:31:42 okay yeah it is funny I I I know at some point I had over recordings that I guess
00:31:49 at some point I deleted for space but um because I was very intent on clearing
00:31:56 space on my computer at a certain point but yeah I'll put it there there it is
00:32:02 who drew that me that was so comic from a while ago I forget who drew it it was
00:32:14 like the artist was someone you it was drinking moth you linked them in the
00:32:19 last episode I think oh yeah oh yes yes yes I realized that drinking moth has
00:32:26 drawn a bunch of things that I remember over the over the years drinking moth
00:32:31 is a very cool PCP fan I like yeah yeah I am I realized as we were talking with
00:32:42 you I said wait I know wait I remember this person did the the what do you
00:32:47 call it the league of the the league of Nate fuckers is the one that jumps to
00:32:52 mind yeah it's gonna focus one that that's for panel the the thing I use in
00:32:57 the YouTube thumbnail was for panel where you were freaking out about the pig
00:33:00 the pig the pig is coming the pig is coming yeah yeah so scary shit man yeah
00:33:10 you know I had I don't I'm not gonna go in any detail about this I'm keeping this
00:33:16 a secret I have decided I have decided to stop being fucking stupid what yeah
00:33:26 that's your whole character I know not anymore I'm turning off turning on I'm
00:33:30 decided to stop being stupid and do something that might actually succeed in
00:33:36 the free market and I'm not gonna go and I'm not gonna say what that is porn but
00:33:41 I'm no it's not I'm sorry good guess good reasonable guess nah not
00:33:49 interested something even better if you can believe it I'm nice give I talk to
00:33:57 you about it I'm gonna do it oh I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to do it kind of
00:34:02 soon I'm just it needs a little it needs I I shouldn't dwell on it because I'm
00:34:08 not giving details and this is gonna be really annoying to be so vague but it's
00:34:13 gonna take set yeah what you told me was like there was a thing that I didn't I
00:34:20 didn't pry about I'm wondering like okay yeah we can't talk about it cuz it's
00:34:26 secretive I'll just say it's gonna take it's gonna take set up and it's gonna
00:34:31 take some money I'm gonna have to invest some money in getting it done and my
00:34:36 hope is to be I'm trying to figure out how to do it for little enough money that
00:34:42 I don't think that I think it will be turn up turn a profit is the is the is
00:34:48 the difficult thing I've been I've been making phone calls they have not led
00:34:53 anywhere yet but I'll keep I'll keep at it because I would kind of random phone
00:34:59 calls to random because I would like to do that when you are in in town when
00:35:06 you're visiting so I have that's in like a month so I'm just gonna try and get it
00:35:11 set up by then and we'll see how that works out but I'm excited to maybe not
00:35:17 be such a fucking failure maybe I don't know that's my goal that would be wild
00:35:24 if that happened I don't know the Ben Saints success arc but we'll but we'll
00:35:29 see we'll see one and maybe in a couple weeks I can tell you what I'm talking
00:35:35 about listeners let me not let me not dwell on this anymore let me not keep
00:35:41 us from the important topics at hand this week I've mostly just been like
00:35:51 trying to figure out pumpkin alley concept art for the pre-production phase
00:35:56 yeah how's that going and it's yeah I mean I've had these this this this level
00:36:04 that comes after the first level in my head and I'm like alright this is this
00:36:10 part and this is the next part and this is an enemy and I'll just draw down a
00:36:16 design for an enemy oh this enemy will block you a fun thing about pumpkin alley
00:36:20 is like thinking of ways that the enemies and and all the things can be like
00:36:25 designed around the ability that punk has which is burning stuff mm-hmm so yeah
00:36:29 this is like a sandy level they're sand so you use your fire breath to turn sand
00:36:36 into glass so you can you can heat up like sandy enemies turn them into glass
00:36:42 and then smash them hmm so it's like freezing them with fire yeah that's
00:36:49 neat that's very that's very neat so there's all sorts of like like thinking
00:36:55 of like a type of enemy that is just unique from all other types of enemies
00:36:59 and you have to deal with it in a certain way and just making it fit with the
00:37:04 location saying lower I will do this and that I haven't got I think the next thing
00:37:09 I need to do is like draw a literal like level plan layout of like the floor yeah
00:37:17 and stuff I don't really know anything about pre-production I'm just sort of
00:37:22 like doing things I assume will be helpful to refer to later and that's
00:37:30 it is that like I'm I just I just don't know what I'm doing it's the stupidest
00:37:35 thing ever yeah making a game making a game doesn't make any sense you just you
00:37:42 fuck around and then suddenly you're playing something like I don't understand
00:37:46 that is fucked up it's really fucked up when that happens that's really messed
00:37:52 up it's bad it's bad stop stop it oh my god I'm I'm I'm happy you
00:38:00 when when people I occasionally check if people like are playing pumpkin alley
00:38:04 the demo and I watch everything I can it's just nice seeing people enjoy it yeah
00:38:10 I have seen a slow a slow a continual slow trickle of a few more people downloading
00:38:18 phantoms revenge you know a couple people a day maybe here and there and that's
00:38:23 that's nice that's not what is this I wonder I wonder how high the number
00:38:30 will eventually go maybe a billion on a long enough time scale maybe I mean
00:38:38 extrapolated to infinity every human being on earth will eventually play the
00:38:43 game so for the last few days it's mostly been that and then occasionally
00:38:50 Elden Ring streaming and nothing nothing nothing is happening that's okay
00:38:59 that's fine I've been I've been doing the book I've been doing more I'm almost
00:39:07 done converting the phantoms revenge story beats to book pages it is so
00:39:15 tedious I hate doing it it's just like oh take screenshots and then arrange them
00:39:23 and then cut them up and post them on the page and it's like the most boring
00:39:27 thing and I hate it but I have like I'm almost done with it and then I can
00:39:34 actually pick paper and then I can actually maybe order a fucking test copy
00:39:38 and then I should really just buckle down and finish that because once that's
00:39:44 done I really can like start to get that book Kickstarter underway which is a big
00:39:48 kind of a big deal this I should probably try and try and finish that like
00:39:57 this week it shouldn't really take me that long but that's what I was doing
00:40:01 like this weekend yesterday I'm getting so close to having a hundred
00:40:09 Hades I got the I got the epilogue I got the basically true ending I'm a bit sad
00:40:18 because um you have the you get the true ending and then all of the gods set they
00:40:24 start saying different things to you because like your relationship to them
00:40:28 has changed a little bit and now I'm like oh well now I'll never hear every now
00:40:33 I'll never hear every scrap of voice dialogue in the entire game now now
00:40:39 won't yeah now like like the it's forever like your safe ball is like it
00:40:47 seems like it because start over what if you because because before I mean this
00:40:56 is a bit of a spoiler if you care about such things before all the gods think
00:41:03 you're trying to think you're trying well they think I don't know whatever
00:41:10 it's the point is they have a big party you have a big part you have a big
00:41:13 party and everyone makes friends and forgives each other and you're a big
00:41:16 happy family and it's nice so instead of like befuddlement and confusion that
00:41:22 like why are you still why are like why are you still not like broken out yet
00:41:27 Zagreus now they switch to be in like oh hey no hard feelings man hey love you
00:41:33 guys so it's like how many more times could I hear them say like hey man your
00:41:40 dad sucks fuck that guy here's a here's a gun that shoots lightning now they're
00:41:45 like oh hey no hard feelings have a gun nephew I'll never know yeah there's so
00:41:57 many lines there's so much there's so much dialogue I mean my family never gives
00:42:01 me guns yeah they give you like here hey hey nephew hey if you now you'll shoot
00:42:10 now you shoot tidal waves haha fuck your dad bye my dad is fucked up is that
00:42:18 true I would never if I mentioned on the PCP that my my birth father is a
00:42:24 conspiracy crazy man oh god yeah a lot of that what going around these days like
00:42:32 QAnon or these days probably but like way wilder shit than that if you can
00:42:38 believe it like flat earth I mean it's possible I yeah maybe maybe he's
00:42:46 secretive about that one I don't know when I was growing up I didn't see my
00:42:51 birth father much I was very little when my stepdad came in and he was a good
00:42:55 guy very cool guy yeah my birth father I would see him very occasionally you know
00:43:01 you know when he decided to visit or decided to be at his house when we tried
00:43:06 to visit him wasn't too great but I know I was a dumb kid I thought I liked him
00:43:12 a lot when I was really little because he would take us to McDonald's and buy
00:43:15 me an ice cream and my my parents wouldn't do that what more do you need and he
00:43:20 would run out of movie and would watch it and I'm like whoa time with him is so
00:43:22 good it's amazing it's like almost as if he only has to make an effort once a
00:43:27 year or less yeah yeah yeah yeah but uh yeah so I was I was unaware of the
00:43:33 conspiracy shit until I think in 2007 we moved into his well we were basically
00:43:41 spending a lot of time in his city because my grandmother the one extended
00:43:48 relative who I have any or I had any sort of close relationship with got
00:43:51 cancer because all my all my other relatives I feel pretty like I don't
00:43:58 feel like an oven that well but but my Nana I really liked her she always
00:44:03 used to make pancakes and so that was sad but whereas I was seeing my I see my
00:44:07 father a lot more because we were in his town that was your your your your
00:44:13 birth father's mom was your Nana no no no Nana was stepdad's mom I don't know
00:44:19 any of the family on my birth's father's side I okay I don't know what any of them
00:44:23 look like I I know one of them is called Nana 80 I think we call her I don't
00:44:30 even I don't think I've even spoken to her since I was like maybe five I have no
00:44:34 idea but um the they just in the same town by coincidence at Hamilton New
00:44:39 Zealand Hamilton so it's been a lot more time around him and then and then at
00:44:45 this point I'm like a 12 and I'm noticing he has fucking vision boards all
00:44:49 over his house that have like like borderline porn in them because he just
00:44:54 wants sex I guess and he just has always an appropriate posters yeah the
00:45:00 secret he was into the secret he tried it's like it's like I'm imagining like
00:45:07 the Charlie Charlie from Always Sunny with like you know strings like
00:45:11 conspiracy strings attached no no no a vision board is like it has to do with
00:45:16 the secret and the law of attraction all that that oh so it's like it's like a
00:45:23 collage of stuff that you want in your life yes and if you just stare at it
00:45:27 real hard it'll just fucking happen I guess I stare I stare at pornography a
00:45:34 lot so I was like noticing oh this man's a little bit of a sleaze ball this
00:45:43 I was the first inkling and then he's he tried to show us for secret and then he
00:45:46 tried showing us zeitgeist and then he tried show it which was all about like
00:45:50 9-11 conspiracies and then he tried showing us like footage of like like
00:45:55 it's just like gray like it just looks like gray like satellite footage looking
00:46:00 at clouds and there's like a dark spot in the cloud that like moves and
00:46:04 occasionally there's lights flashing and he's like you see that's the
00:46:07 mothership for us is in war with the aliens right now and then showing us
00:46:13 audio of a woman who is clearly fucking she's she's on some fucking drugs she's
00:46:20 on some fucking drugs who's like yeah and then princess Diana she didn't die in
00:46:26 a car crash those were dummies they um it was a ritual blood sacrifice from the
00:46:33 lizards for shape-shifting lizards um and yeah and I'm like how do you know I'm
00:46:41 on board how do you know that like where's her evidence you're just taking
00:46:45 the word of some random girl how does she know this he's like you sure she
00:46:50 didn't just fucking imagine it she sounds high as fuck and he's like nah nah
00:46:53 she just sounds so sure
00:46:58 cool and then my parents somebody who believes it then it has to be true
00:47:02 that's exactly and then my parents like I told my parents like he's I've been
00:47:08 seeing him more he's been saying a lot of weird shit and my parents like oh yeah
00:47:11 dude like so like after 9-11 we go to phone call from him saying the Jews the
00:47:17 Jews were behind this the Ark of the Covenant was on the plane you know oh
00:47:21 my god wow okay um but but then I guess later so yeah Ark of the Covenant on
00:47:29 the 9-11 planes that's that was his original conspiracy for that and then
00:47:33 it was they weren't planes they were missiles and the wings were edited in
00:47:36 using a you know Hollywood movie magic you know I've never heard I've never
00:47:42 heard either of those before so wait wait is it the Ark of the Covenant opened
00:47:46 and that's what melted the steel beams like I like it melted the the Nazi's
00:47:52 faces yeah yeah like like first it's the Ark of the Covenant was on the plane
00:47:58 then it's there were no planes there were missiles you know despite the fact
00:48:03 that thousands of people witnessed it no at everyone in New York was paid and
00:48:06 all every video footage they took they edited they did movie Hollywood movie
00:48:11 magic on it and faked it to make the missiles look like planes missiles are
00:48:14 not the size of planes I don't think he realizes how small missiles are they're
00:48:20 really not that big not technology you just put a PNG on it and you have a
00:48:26 big old plane and then it's oh the work the planes are real but there was a
00:48:30 controlled demolition at the base which is not what the video footage shows the
00:48:34 building collapses from the top down not from the bottom like into itself but
00:48:39 whatever so it's so bizarre that people like decide like it's it's like thinking
00:48:48 about it as like a coping mechanism it's so obvious why they decide that things
00:48:53 that could be distressing have to have been like controlled demolitions and not
00:48:58 like just the world being chaotic yeah they don't want to like they never get
00:49:05 conspiratorial about something that isn't like a serious problem or like a
00:49:09 big chaotic thing I mean there are conspiracies there are conspiracies like
00:49:16 that but my lot of things these people care about it's always to explain like
00:49:20 horrible things happening tragedies and like shootings all fake never happened
00:49:25 that kind of thing yeah it can't it can't possibly be that the world is is it's
00:49:32 just crazy sometimes it has to have been a secret person involved in it and if
00:49:38 only I beat them up the world will be safe and nice yeah it's true he's
00:49:44 earned to aliens as well yeah the best one though this is the best one I'll
00:49:50 never I actually forgot about this for like 10 years until I remembered so it's
00:49:54 years like maybe 2007 or 2008 we're visiting them we put on Pirates of a
00:50:01 Caribbean free he's never seen it and the Pirates of a Caribbean free it opens
00:50:05 you know you have a bunch of pirates you know being executed they're being
00:50:10 taken to the gallows and they're seeing a sea shanty and like they're just being
00:50:15 like executing like five at a time and then the next lot goes up executed next
00:50:20 lot goes up executed they're just hanging a bunch of them and my dad's
00:50:24 watching this and he's like oh my god oh my god this is this is what they did
00:50:29 to the victims of 9-11 they weren't on the planes that there are no people on
00:50:33 those planes the real victims were flown to Mars where they were executed just
00:50:37 like this that's like that that is like crazier than I would have expected
00:50:44 like what how would you say that how would you say that every time you see
00:50:49 every time you watch Pirates of a Caribbean free just remember this
00:50:51 happened on Mars they flew the planes there to kill the people it's like the
00:50:58 plot of Adventure Time basically I want to know where to happen if we showed
00:51:05 him spirit science he probably believes the moon is fake never asked me about
00:51:09 that it really it really does sound like yeah sound like they're just any any
00:51:16 he'll just he'll just believe show him show anything that sounds a little weird
00:51:20 and like the the moon explodes and it's like Eggman's robot and it's like that's
00:51:24 true probably it is true there it is true that they just believe anything
00:51:30 because they believe contradictory shit too like well they're a hundred percent
00:51:33 like all wars fake all wars manufactured there's a one-world government the 12
00:51:38 fat the 12 Jewish families the Rothschilds and the blah blah blah who
00:51:42 control everything the 12 banks they rule the world and all politics is just a
00:51:46 distraction I'll say that but at the same time they'll be like yeah we have to
00:51:51 kill bin Laden you we we got to get them over fucker
00:51:58 even though 9-11 was fake to justify the war that would be fake but no it's
00:52:04 actually real it's just okay yeah it's like it's like just like whatever I
00:52:09 don't know it really is just just whatever it makes them feel better to
00:52:14 think about anything as it seems to be the through line and and generally it
00:52:20 makes them feel better to think that someone's in control even if like
00:52:26 nominally it's bad people that's probably why they say fuck bin Laden
00:52:31 because bin Laden is like a known person that is like oh it's the bad guy to get
00:52:36 the bad guy I gotta get the bad guy and it's like that's kind of true if there's
00:52:41 someone you can point to be like this is the guy that caused that problem yeah we
00:52:46 can get him just want to have someone to get make sense they should play call
00:52:53 duty you should play video games I agree oh my god I agree there's always a bad
00:52:59 guy in a video game I just remembered another thing he told me he's like you
00:53:03 know you know why in movies I've been studying film you know why in movies
00:53:08 like darkness is associated with evil it's because two thousand years ago back
00:53:14 in the time of Jesus at night there were monsters there were monsters roaming
00:53:18 around like giant like jackals and in creatures of a night that would eat
00:53:23 people and eat babies every day and we learn to associate these these these
00:53:29 these satanic forces with the darkness and all this shit they just used to be
00:53:36 monsters everywhere the truth is that in the dark sometimes you stub your toe
00:53:42 because you can't see it and so people thought we shouldn't walk around at night
00:53:46 and then the dark became became avoidable you must avoid the night in the
00:53:53 dark there's a wolf and it goes oh and it bites you sometimes it goes awoo
00:53:58 sometimes you fall off a cliff sometimes you get cold and there's no fire
00:54:06 actually every time so I'm sorry he said that there used to be like real like
00:54:15 darkness demons in the world and that's yeah like every RPG ever well like eco
00:54:21 yeah I just every RPG ever just like RPG monsters just used to roam they would
00:54:28 just like appear at night and yeah well where do you think all the idea for all
00:54:33 those RPGs came from that's that's like um what is it I I'd heard about it
00:54:39 elsewhere but Dan Olson talked a little about it in I think it was the I think
00:54:46 it was the Flat Earth video yeah how like the the the cons like the conspiracy
00:54:53 mindset like the Flat Earth and the QAnon stuff is all like it all just kind
00:54:59 of like pulls it all just kind of pulls stuff including from like fiction
00:55:04 including like they'll take some tidbit of esoteric like mythology and use
00:55:11 that to explain like oh yeah this explains like the story of Jack and the
00:55:15 Beanstalk or something where did Jack and the Beanstalk come from oh well
00:55:19 it's because Giants the Nephilim and you know the the world tree was the Beanstalk
00:55:24 and stuff like it's like it's like it's literally just a fairy tale but
00:55:27 sometimes they'll sometimes they'll use that as evidence for something they do
00:55:31 they do get obsessed with fiction though don't they like they'll read like
00:55:34 fiction books and say though this is real like my dad like the Da Vinci code was
00:55:38 like a documentary yeah I think so they're just looking for for something
00:55:45 to latch on to that was me that was me as like a kid that was me like only I
00:55:51 didn't think it was real but I would think like I don't know this but he did
00:55:56 I think it's is real I would I would think I would think oh this character is
00:56:02 described as wearing like a long red coat with a high collar I should get a
00:56:06 long red coat with a high collar that's real that would look cool in real life
00:56:13 and it was true it worked that's it's uh it's uh it's pretty pretty wacky
00:56:23 there's some real wackiness in the world today these days think about how
00:56:30 like everything all the stories was was written by cowards who couldn't take
00:56:36 shit they go out into the dark they go out into the dark and they're like oh
00:56:40 somebody died because they fell into a bog well they didn't just trip and fall
00:56:44 into a bog you see it was a bog demon monster and they'll grab you and pull
00:56:50 you under oh yeah and that's the story and the kids they gather around they
00:56:55 believe it and only the cowards tell these stories because those are the
00:56:58 only guys who survive and then they invent all this mythology and then
00:57:03 thousands of years later people make video game monsters in real life about
00:57:07 those stories and then thousands of years later JK Rowling took all those
00:57:11 monsters and made them a parable about why slavery is good put them all in that
00:57:19 book oh yeah sold a billion copies my my dad my dad is pretty smart pretty
00:57:28 educated guy but he is he has shown a bit of susceptibility to pretty pretty
00:57:36 normal widespread you know boomer like moral panic stuff like he thought he
00:57:42 thought video games would rot your brain he thought D&D was like a little he
00:57:46 thought D&D was a little bit satanic just a little bit I was gonna say it
00:57:51 sounds a little like my stepdad but not quite he played a lot of games no my my
00:57:58 dad my dad probably played D&D at some point I feel like he must have maybe
00:58:06 maybe he was a little bit too old there was a point in my childhood where
00:58:10 parents my parents were like magic school bus witchcraft but then they got
00:58:16 over it cuz they went to university and then they were like my dad was a
00:58:19 little bit like my dad was a little bit like I this seems a little satanic but
00:58:24 he didn't really didn't really do anything about it he just kind of
00:58:28 vaguely guilted you like yeah you shouldn't hmm you might go to hell well
00:58:35 that's the free market you didn't feel that strongly about weird actually I
00:58:44 always thought like man if you really think the devil is at work here like I
00:58:48 would I would really want to do something about that but I mean that's
00:58:52 that's just me maybe the maybe the devil ain't so bad yeah my parents go over
00:58:59 that stuff eventually or at least they did with me like they were very strict
00:59:03 on my sister if my sister listened to like gothic music like like metal music
00:59:06 or whatever they would like freak out and moral panic at her and tell her she
00:59:10 needs to go see Jesus and shit but I would listen to the same music and they
00:59:14 would just be like oh that's cool yeah listen to metal music you will turn into
00:59:20 metal you will become magnetic yeah you turn a metal Mario it's and that song
00:59:29 will play like it'll play forever if you if you play if you play if you play
00:59:37 cradle of filth backwards it sounds like yeah I bought a cradle of filth
00:59:50 album and my dad I think I think I've had a cradle of filth album we were
00:59:55 listening to it in my basement with my friends we were over for D&D and my dad
00:59:58 just made just made just a sarcastic look comments like hmm you guys listening
01:00:03 to devil worship music down there and I was like no dad it's it's it's art dad
01:00:10 you understand honey and sulfur is a banger though at least the opening of
01:00:18 that song is a banger I don't even remember what that is I'll be honest I
01:00:26 was just I was just I was just into that stuff to look cool for my friends I was
01:00:32 I was I don't think I was I think I like some of it I like some music that I my
01:00:40 friends got me into genuinely other stuff I was like oh my friends are all
01:00:43 goth I should get into goth stuff too I didn't pose enough I was too into like
01:00:51 the one band I mean I was I was I was too like dad rock focus because like I
01:00:58 like Led Zeppelin and the Beatles and and and like David Bowie and Elton John
01:01:04 and all that and everyone was listening to contemporary bands that were coming
01:01:09 out right now with the hot new 90s tracks of what 2000s music and they were like
01:01:15 yeah look at this listen to this what do you like Gibb they didn't say Gibb and I
01:01:23 would say um you know stuff cuz they didn't they didn't know the Beatles but
01:01:30 I didn't want to be like um you don't know the Beatles I didn't want to be like
01:01:35 I don't want to be like a freak who likes the Beatles I was like the Beatles
01:01:41 that's like bug that's stupid what the fuck that was me that's a bug that's like
01:01:47 a glitch in the system why would you name yourself the Beatles is it because
01:01:50 beat like music has a beat are you dumb are you trying to be clever get out took
01:01:56 me a long time to realize that the name had an a in it and that it and that it
01:02:02 was a joke look at these bowl cut boys they're not for me I said they were not
01:02:09 for you they were for young girls in the 60s 50s it's crazy it's crazy listening
01:02:16 to live performances from like Elvis or the Beatles back then and understanding
01:02:21 oh this is where the term fangirl came from yeah like just like they were
01:02:28 screams so fucking loud it's nothing like today people faint in it's like they'd
01:02:34 never seen a boy before basically maybe they hadn't maybe they weren't allowed I
01:02:39 guess I would have been you're so is it is it is it nothing like today does that
01:02:45 do they not the like the way they scream is like it sounds like they're being
01:02:49 murdered it's like blood curling like where today it's just like people
01:02:53 cheering like like and they chair a lot but like it's some of the clips I've
01:02:57 seen it's like like they're shrieking that's very they're shrieking it was
01:03:03 loudest shrieking they're like fainting they're crying and shitting and coming
01:03:09 you know all of that at the same time ironically in the front row but you can't
01:03:14 you know like you can't hear like the music over it like almost that that's
01:03:18 why they started doing studio albums more is because they couldn't like
01:03:22 literally couldn't do live performances because they couldn't hear
01:03:25 themselves it was just like a big like screaming thing it's like okay well I
01:03:29 don't like this I liked the music I want to do music and then they stopped they
01:03:33 stopped appearing live forever exactly until they didn't until they appeared dead
01:03:38 as we all must I do remember like a couple times would say what's your
01:03:47 favorite band say oh Led Zeppelin oh the Beatles and they would say oh cool
01:03:50 because they knew what that was they didn't care and I didn't follow up with
01:03:56 anything because I didn't know what to say and that was it I should have posed
01:04:01 more I should have been like yeah I'm into whatever you're into you know what
01:04:05 are you into I'm like I'm into as I lay dying and they're like as I laid as I lay
01:04:11 crying more like haha and then yeah yeah I would have to and then I will
01:04:18 literally be laying there dying because of being beaten to a pulp you don't like
01:04:24 cannibal corpse you don't like amazing songs such as I come blood get out
01:04:32 cannibal corpse I'm gonna cannibalize your corpse kills you eats you oh no

01:07:26 body armor and stuff the stakes the stakes would be so high oh yeah did you
01:07:33 see that um Andrew Callahan formerly known as all gas no breaks just fucking
01:07:39 went to Ukraine oh I don't know that which I'm not sure which guy I've heard
01:07:45 that name all gas no breaks before it's a guy who would just show up to random
01:07:50 events usually like events like flatter of conferences and like or just like you
01:07:55 know just just any place where he would expect he would find crazy people and he
01:07:59 would just walk up to randoms in the street point a microphone at them and
01:08:02 just let them say whatever the fuck and wait is that the guy from channel five oh yeah channel
01:08:07 five of Andrew Callahan yeah yeah that's yeah yeah I I have seen him he made a video in
01:08:14 car key no not car key in Ukraine is in Ukraine somewhere yeah it was like a like an air siren
01:08:21 went off and they went to hide and there's a cat the family was bringing their cat and it was good
01:08:28 yeah this this guy this guy is cool um he he's met some fucking weird people
01:08:37 he just goes where the where stuff happens and just interviews random people and it's interesting
01:08:44 yeah proper journalism that's that's that's real
01:08:48 it is it's very well I guess Gonzo journalism what does Gonzo mean I think if you go and you
01:08:53 join the war and you report on it yeah I think I would call that Gonzo journalism
01:08:58 I don't know if he joined the war he just kind of showed up and just with a microphone yeah I
01:09:03 don't think he's killing anyone I think he's just on the scene oh well then I'm not sure
01:09:10 not sure if that counts then
01:09:16 damn war is bad it is no I like it more war please can we invade I respect another country
01:09:26 I don't I may not agree but I respect your opinion maybe it's good to some people
01:09:34 I think we should invade Wales and finally like kill that dragon slay that dragon somebody's
01:09:41 got to do it yeah St George was like the the the the the patron saint of England and he is like
01:09:48 the guy who slayed a dragon but Wales is right there and the dragon is alive I think we gotta
01:09:54 we gotta solve this problem we gotta end this all all of the people in Elden Ring are Welsh
01:10:01 so that's what I'm basically doing and what by playing Elden Ring I'm killing the Welsh
01:10:06 you're redistributing the Welsh like like cutting them up into pieces and distributed
01:10:11 in like redistributing their arms and legs all around
01:10:14 it's true they got some great accents in in Elden Ring I wouldn't know I've not really seen any of
01:10:27 the game still I think they're they're largely all Welsh Welsh accents and a few like the British
01:10:37 ones not sure there was that a fucking voicemail this was a long time ago I only remember it because
01:10:47 I used to in the pig fucker thing the pig fucker the interrupting deaf pig there there's a guy who's
01:10:52 like I really want a Welsh speaking family oh and I don't even know what I remember that voicemail
01:10:59 like what the point of it was I just remember that I had the pig come in but I remember it it's weird
01:11:08 wasn't there that one guy in I think the original Dark Souls there's like a guy who uses like a
01:11:13 like a Welsh or Scottish greeting Aishimai that guy yes the Aishimai guy who I never even found
01:11:20 in my no maybe I did I think maybe I found him later you you find him either he's on that bridge
01:11:28 in yeah he's under the bridge in Firelink Shrine or earlier you can see him just before you enter
01:11:34 Blighttown from the depths right down that that weird guy that weird little tinker mask dude
01:11:41 he's from Elden Ring they're all connected there's that one guy from Bloodborne in the DLC of Dark
01:11:46 Souls one that's what I'm thinking and there's that Samurai looking guy in the uh in the old uh
01:11:55 what do you call it Darkroot Garden bit you can talk to he's from Sekiro wait Samurai looking guy
01:12:02 Samurai looking guy in Darkroot Garden I don't remember yeah um when you talk to you know the
01:12:08 place where there's like all those NPC like people and the ghosts in the forest that attack you
01:12:13 it's like the the fighter the cleric the the ranger oh yeah yeah yeah with the cat yeah if you join
01:12:19 the cat covenant a samurai and a ninja will like appear just outside the building and you can go
01:12:27 talk to him and then later you can find him down in the bottom of Blighttown and like you can buy
01:12:32 his weapon I think oh huh don't remember that yeah he's a cool guy nifty nifty um it's been yeah
01:12:43 been a while since I uh since I played in these souls the only thing I've really seen I've seen
01:12:48 bits and pieces of Elden Ring and I've seen um is it is it named Radon I've seen Radon
01:12:55 yeah Radon I I I haven't beaten him yet but I have fought him he's an interesting
01:13:00 interesting battle yeah oh I've seen um oh and of course I've seen uh let me solo her
01:13:08 oh yeah that yeah I've heard of that I haven't seen I I haven't looked at like the boss because I
01:13:15 don't know what boss it is it's probably like one of the hardest ones I know what that that that boss
01:13:19 I've seen art of that boss I have not actually seen the that boss looks like the fucking um digimon
01:13:26 yeah angel looks like angel woman angel angel woman yeah yeah she does millennia got the valkyrie
01:13:33 helmet yeah she looks great looks awesome uh yeah I'm um Elden Ring sounds really good uh
01:13:45 you said on twitter the other day that it makes it's like the feeling of exploring
01:13:49 world of warcraft yeah I that that was like oh that sounds cool that's a good way this that
01:13:56 that's an appealing way it it really does feel like because like I mean like old school world
01:14:01 of warcraft specifically because like in newer versions of world of warcraft the quests are
01:14:07 very railroad-y and like take you on a very specific path and there are lots of cutscenes and
01:14:13 and like like you feel like you're going through a theme park or a tour and it doesn't feel like a
01:14:18 big world that you're exploring but older world of warcraft quests they're just sort of like
01:14:22 it go here and do this and so for a lot of a lot of the gameplay of early world of warcraft you're
01:14:28 just sort of walking around and killing things and moving and killing things and looking around
01:14:33 and killing things and being like oh look at that building look at castle look at this it feels very
01:14:37 similar in Elden Ring because that's basically what you're doing you just you kill things because
01:14:42 they would kill you otherwise and you're just got you got a horse and you're just going
01:14:48 I watched um I think it was kind of an older video I watched the never knows best video
01:14:54 about a Final Fantasy uh which one's the online one is it 14 14 yeah yeah and then I think I
01:15:02 watched an older video of his about it's just about MMOs like in general and um I think it was older
01:15:10 and uh he pointed something out that I hadn't really thought about but it's like um old like
01:15:18 if you were playing like playing MMOs now like people know how to play them like people have
01:15:25 there are guides you can read that will just explain to you like the the optimal way to level
01:15:30 up your character like if you were playing like when World of Warcraft came out like nobody
01:15:35 knew that and no guides existed and everyone was just figuring it out and fucking around
01:15:42 and I got it that sounds so much more fun than like look look up a guide that like tells you
01:15:47 like the optimum spell rotation I mean yeah that's definitely what happened with World of Warcraft
01:15:53 Classic when they brought that out because you got like thousands upon thousands of super veteran
01:15:59 players who couldn't wait to get back to reliving their early days in World of Warcraft but yeah
01:16:05 but you can never really do it again yeah the player base has changed so much that even if
01:16:10 all of the content is the same the way the game is played is completely different yeah like everybody
01:16:16 min-maxed everything like the the old game used to be unbalanced and so everybody was choosing the
01:16:22 correct like class and like spec thing to do the maximum damage and if you weren't if you didn't want
01:16:29 to play as that you would just die because the game was just not balanced for every class
01:16:35 back in the day so it would just suck if you didn't want to play like the optimal thing and
01:16:40 everybody was playing the optimal thing because they wanted to get all of the stuff as fast as
01:16:45 possible because they knew how and it's just like a lot of people didn't like it but I didn't mind
01:16:51 because I never was good at World of Warcraft in terms of like high level rating or pvp I just
01:17:00 like the place so I was just walking around and I would I played for like a couple months with my
01:17:06 brother we had two torrents and we were just like I was a shaman and he was a warrior and we would just
01:17:14 like do little quests in little places and be like oh we're backing each other up it sounds
01:17:20 really fun I played I played I played a few months in the summer of Wrath of the Lich King
01:17:28 and I leveled up my character and I explored the world and I and I fucked around I didn't
01:17:32 play it that optimally I was just I was just fucking around that was just some way to do it
01:17:36 yeah I was just getting like I would get a staff and I would be like oh this staff looks really cool
01:17:40 it's not as good as that other staff but like I just really like how this one looks I'm gonna keep it
01:17:45 uh and uh uh and then I got to the end and I got a max level and I was like oh time to raid
01:17:52 and then I did a couple raids I was like oh this isn't fun at all I'm done game over by uh yeah
01:17:59 it's really weird how the raids like they step up the the skill floor requirements so high
01:18:11 from just playing the game solo or with a small group or just like casually going through it and
01:18:16 suddenly all of a sudden I'm getting yelled at for playing wrong yeah all of a sudden it's like
01:18:21 like the game hadn't really like set you up to do a raid no by the time you're able to do them
01:18:30 and it's like it's so I always remember like raiding being like a surefire way to feel like
01:18:38 shit and know that you need to do a lot of work before you're even close to being ready
01:18:44 and I'm like you know what I don't want to do a lot of work I'm not gonna do the raids and I never
01:18:50 did yeah that was like um when I when I played League of Legends I played Warwick and I kind of
01:19:00 figured out how to play Warwick I was like yeah all right I'm sort of getting it and then my my
01:19:05 friends who I was playing with were like yeah good okay now you now you have to do that with
01:19:10 like every character because like uh you need you need to know how all your enemies are gonna
01:19:16 play too so you have to know every character you don't you don't have to do that with every
01:19:19 character that's ridiculous I mean they didn't I you know the point is they were saying like
01:19:26 I realized that like there was too much work to be done to be good at the game and you just
01:19:33 to have fun like if you want to like be like real good that's not fun fun is just
01:19:40 having like two or three characters who you're good at who you just specialize in and like yeah
01:19:46 you'll get to know how to do with other characters just by playing against them you don't have to
01:19:50 play a character to understand them like to like to play against them necessarily um I liked
01:19:57 I was the fucking I was like the the tentacle thing um I was Velcaz uh the hentai one whoa
01:20:07 Velcaz I remember uh this this fucking so to show it I always use this skin because it looks
01:20:17 real fucking sick I don't remember this guy at all uh he wasn't played very often um but like
01:20:25 you have to like do geometry and shit because he shoots out a thing and then it splits and
01:20:29 shoots off at a right angle so you have to like shoot your abilities diagonally to like
01:20:34 hit people um and stuff like that I I just had a lot of fun with him um all my like um I forget
01:20:45 what they're fucking called the the little the little things you do that give you a little
01:20:50 outside the game where you can like speck like for extra points of damage or whatever the fuck
01:20:57 forget what they're called your your skill tree or whatever the fuck I called that hentai supreme
01:21:02 um I was I just I was just always joking about tentakling people and they gave him a rework
01:21:09 that just made him really strong and then he was way overpowered and then they just kept
01:21:13 buffing him for years and years they just kept buffing him they never nerfed him ever because
01:21:17 for some reason he was unpopular but I I was fucking great at him and I would always be really
01:21:21 well um that's funny that sounds fun it is fun um I have like I don't know why I picked warwick
01:21:30 I didn't like think he looked cool or anything I think he just seemed simple I think someone
01:21:34 just told me he was like simple I was like okay well I'll do that then yeah yeah my best experience
01:21:41 I had with League of Legends was an experience I recorded it was the first time I played IRF
01:21:46 which is ultra rapid fire it's that April Fool's game mode where you can just all your
01:21:51 your cooldowns are basically nothing you can just spam everything and you have infinite mana
01:21:55 and it's just a clusterfuck my first round of that I fucking destroyed everything it was so much fun
01:22:02 and I never topped that again and then eventually I just stopped playing League unless it was IRF
01:22:08 and then even then I stopped playing after a while and then Kai sold his account that was worth like
01:22:14 $10,000 and only got like 2k for it wow we both like hard quit about a year ago
01:22:24 yeah well I hadn't really been playing for a few years but um he still was but yeah he even
01:22:29 sold his account finally and we're fucking done with that shit no more League of Legends
01:22:35 yeah I realized it wasn't something I really wanted to sink a lot of time into it's just not
01:22:42 worth it it's just it's just frustrating it is just a frustrating experience most of the time
01:22:48 I had League of Legends and Clash of Clans are exactly the same thing I don't I don't have no idea
01:22:55 what Clash of Clans even is I've never seen it or played it or seen anything I just think of it
01:22:59 as like oh it's like vaguely medieval fantasy wacky to kill each people and it's like you play
01:23:06 on your phone and keep thinking of League of Legends as the one of those mobile games
01:23:11 I've just seen the little blonde viking guy yeah Clash of Clans is the screaming viking man whose
01:23:20 head is like somewhat square shaped I imagine it's like some kind of RTS sort of thing like you
01:23:27 control your your troops on a little field or something there's a lot of like RTS mobile games
01:23:32 and they could be a tower defense it's just sort of like I'll never play them yeah I'm offended
01:23:37 by the art style gives me the same vibes even though I have seen footage of it and I know that
01:23:41 it's like a game that has more to it it's just so like oh god you is that his hair or a helmet
01:23:48 it's his hair that doesn't look like that's just how hair looks in Clash of Clans Clash of Clans
01:23:54 is offensively unappealing that's a fucking playmobil hair that's fucking clip on playmobil
01:24:01 that's exactly right yeah something's weird it's his it's his eyebrows too his hair just becomes
01:24:07 his eyebrows I feel like it's deliberately I feel like it's yeah I feel like it's deliberately meant
01:24:15 to look like a helmet and hair at once I think we're falling for its trap they're trying to trip
01:24:23 you up speaking of marzipan uh I made I'm making gummies again I tried yeah I started
01:24:31 that again and I I had tried this before and the results had not been good but I gave it another
01:24:37 shot and it actually worked out pretty well it was using a corn fiber instead of isomolto
01:24:42 ligosaccharide oh my god isomolto licoficorica I'm also isomolgo ligosaccharide I think I think my
01:24:52 old approach was like stupid um because what I would do is I would take the fiber before it was
01:24:58 imo sometimes I would I would try I tried corn fiber and didn't work and I would take the fiber and
01:25:04 I would put it in water and I would cook it and I would reduce it down into a syrup and then I would
01:25:09 use the syrup to make gummies and I think that's just an unnecessary step and a step that can can
01:25:17 go wrong and that it like introduces like more uncertainty into the outcome this week I've
01:25:23 just been making little tiny batches and it's not even bothering to make the syrup I just put it all
01:25:28 in one I just put the water in the pan and then I just combine the ingredients right in the pan
01:25:33 make it all in one go and like it's fine it works fine and I'm taking notes I have a piece of paper
01:25:39 on my wall here that has all the different batch it has all the ingredient amounts scroll and there's
01:25:44 little red notes that like comparing like okay to make this one like I reduced the corn syrup like
01:25:49 this one I increased the gelatin or whatever um so I'm getting there I feel like I'm already like
01:25:56 pretty close to a to a to a pretty a pretty successful recipe I'm doing a little more
01:26:04 formulaic than I was last time uh and you know what the corn fiber corn fiber is way cheaper than
01:26:10 isomaltoligosaccharide ever was so if it works out with corn fiber then that's just it's just
01:26:16 better so fuck you china for not importing anymore that stuff yeah that's china's biggest mistake
01:26:28 I wouldn't say so yeah and I'm making and they're paying for it now they'll never get
01:26:34 so these are these are no longer keto gummies they're just gummies they're not keto well yeah
01:26:41 they're not keto I'm not focusing on the keto because I'm making them with I'm including
01:26:47 corn syrup and pectin but and pectin contains dextrose but my goal is to get them tasting good
01:26:55 and then I'm gonna try and like adjust the recipe as much as I can to get the sugar content down as
01:27:01 low as I can so like how can I do it with the least corn syrup and the least pectin
01:27:08 so they will hopefully be they will hopefully be low sugar they will probably not be no sugar
01:27:14 but we'll see I made a batch yesterday that was cherry flavor and I put too much of the
01:27:21 cherry flavoring in and it kind of burns my mouth when I eat it um but that's fine the consistency
01:27:28 is great it's it's awesome uh do you have like molds that you're pouring them into yeah well didn't
01:27:38 you didn't you ever see those pictures of the worms that I used to make oh yeah no I forgot that you
01:27:43 made yeah I have the worm molds I also have square molds but like those those make the squares that
01:27:50 they make or they're too big like I don't like biting into like a big rectangle of it and I also
01:27:56 have gummy bear molds but those are too small and they're too annoying like it's really gummy bears
01:28:02 though yeah it's just I don't I don't like how small they are I like to bite off the the tip of a
01:28:09 worm uh and they're also just hard to clean and like they're hard it's hard to like get the liquid
01:28:15 into the bear and you gotta put you gotta take a little eyedropper and put it in a one bear two
01:28:22 bear three bear and you gotta do that like like 40 times yeah yeah I guess if it's like yeah there's
01:28:27 a lot of them make it it's the making the because you've got to do it by hand the bears are annoying
01:28:33 the worms are like okay just do it like 12 just make like pouring it into 12 molds takes like
01:28:38 two minutes it's fine uh so I'm sticking sticking with worms uh for the time for the time being
01:28:45 uh so that's exciting that's very exciting I can't wait to potentially taste one I guess maybe
01:28:56 by the time you come visit I will have a recipe and maybe uh yeah well that's that's exciting
01:29:03 um I'll give I'll give everyone some at that thing that I'm not gonna say what it is
01:29:09 oh everyone who attends uh now I'm talking about attendance I feel like maybe I'm giving the game
01:29:18 away but I'm not gonna it's a wedding wedding if you are at a I'm gonna have a wedding at a bowling
01:29:25 alley um sure my my new project yeah my new you're gonna marry the bowling pin the sexy
01:29:34 bowling pin the new the new the new direction for my career I've decided to stop fucking up
01:29:40 I've decided to actually do what the cuss what the consumer wants I'm gonna get married that'll
01:29:46 make me much more electable as president of the United States statistically speaking we've never
01:29:50 had an unmarried president um yeah I guess so and think of and think of the tax breaks you know
01:29:59 imagine if you're filing filing jointly that's where the real money's at
01:30:04 imagine if your president had a dry penis couldn't possibly be my America I'm gonna vomit just
01:30:11 thinking about it mr president sir mr president sir the american people demand that you wet that
01:30:19 dick
01:30:24 oh it needs to be well laid well laid it's why ben Shapiro it's about ben Shapiro will never be
01:30:30 president because you know his wife his wife's pussy is dry we all know that's true he thinks
01:30:39 having a wet pussy is a medical condition Jesus yeah did you have you uh seen uh you know that
01:30:47 movie don't look up nope you know I've heard I know all that I've heard my sister gave it a glowing
01:30:54 review and then I saw your movie sucks shit all over it and I'm like I don't know this could go
01:31:00 ever way I didn't see any I had I had heard people talking about it on twitter my my dad
01:31:05 thought it was great and he got me to watch it uh over um I think it was a I think it was on my
01:31:13 birthday yeah it was one of my birthday when I went to give them he was like let's watch
01:31:17 don't look up it's great and I was like yeah all right sure and it was uh it was it's about um okay
01:31:28 it's about uh it's it's basically about what if a meteor was gonna hit the earth and the
01:31:36 what what would happen and the answer they come up with is we would all die because the Trump
01:31:41 administration is incompetent and they would they would bungle it and maybe that's true maybe
01:31:48 that's true but it's very it's very it's very like lib it's a very liberal movie and I mean that with
01:31:54 a capital L I mean that in the pejorative sense um it's very but I don't know there's a part where
01:32:02 up just look at your phones Pokemon go to the polls uh it's it's very it's very like
01:32:12 zoomers these days are just zoom into the grave their speed running life that's a bit true it's
01:32:19 very much about like we just we need to we need to trust the scientists and like it's true it's
01:32:25 science is good science is good I kind of I kind of agree it's very smug about it um
01:32:33 but uh the the uh there's a part where the the who might my dad took a careful note to point out
01:32:41 to me like oh yeah this this is the Trump parallel this character is the done and I'm like yes I
01:32:47 understand I get it but Trump is a woman in this movie and there's a part where she like
01:32:54 starts smoking in the oval office and she's like you know they told me on the campaign trail I had
01:32:58 to quit smoking for my image but then you know there was like a candid some candid photos leaked
01:33:04 of me smoking so I just started smoking in public guess what happened my my ratings went up 53%
01:33:11 people love that I kept it real haha and it's and and I guess and I guess you you the viewer
01:33:16 are supposed to shake your head and go uh no decorum this administration has no decorum at all
01:33:26 it's true it is true it's it's hard it's it's rough because I I had to I had to agree with a lot of
01:33:33 of the points the movie was trying to make I had to be like yep that's true but it's it did have that
01:33:38 it did have this at the attitude of like if only like a 40 like a bit a bit hardy and a bit like
01:33:44 darn if only if only if only we didn't have this clown in the White House then we'd be we don't
01:33:51 we don't we trust the science and then we'd we'd all be we'd all be coming up put we'd all be
01:33:57 pushing up daisies no that's not what I meant um you know coming up millhouse it's all very much
01:34:04 like it's just because one singular bad actor is the president that's why we have all these problems
01:34:10 we need to unelect trump that was like half I mean you know it's also about like you know
01:34:17 capitalism bad you know fucking rich inventor weirdo elon musk bezos guy is also a problem
01:34:26 uh you know it was fine it was fine but yeah the I saw it got the movie got like glowing reviews
01:34:33 but then everyone I saw on twitter was like bitching about it and I saw like Ben you have to watch this
01:34:39 movie I'm like oh god I saw those the the title mean like don't look up is in like don't look up the
01:34:46 science like don't look it up on your it means it means it means don't look up at the sky because
01:34:52 there's a meteor that's gonna hit us for like double meaning like don't look it up like don't
01:34:57 don't bother because you don't do that you don't look up the science these days I think it's just
01:35:03 I don't know I think you're reading more into it than is actually I think it just means don't
01:35:08 look at the sky I I saw like my sister talked to me about the movie at length in a call and
01:35:16 gave gave it she gave it a really good sell and I'm like but in the back of mind I'm like yeah my
01:35:22 sister very different like taste in movies these days so I don't know um I saw your movie sucks
01:35:27 talk about and he was like like yeah like don't necessarily disagree with the message or anything
01:35:32 there's just a way it's it's very heavy-handed like very heavy-handed yeah and he showed off
01:35:38 some of the editing in the movie like the way they like show like wow ha ha internet ha ha memes
01:35:43 I'm out and like just shoving like shit in your face it's very boomer-esque oh yeah this is how
01:35:49 boomers see the internet like kind of thing yeah it was it was there's a yeah there's a whole part
01:35:56 it's like oh this the lady goes on a talk show and like freaks out about the meteor and it goes
01:36:02 viral and people make memes about her yeah it's very much like and it's just like draw a fucking
01:36:08 mustache on her whatever it's like well this is what memes are like right kids yeah yeah I'm cool
01:36:15 it was it was it was a boomer's idea of like oh something went viral and became a meme on the
01:36:21 internet that's for sure uh it's I I overlooked that I just I just was like yeah I get it yeah I get
01:36:29 it I get what it's trying I get what it's trying to convey to me I'll probably watch this on point
01:36:34 I'm curious because it's I am interested in BA's um so it's fine it's fine and it remind I mean the
01:36:44 first part where they were like doing astrophysics brought me back to my old college days in the
01:36:50 astronomy laboratory uh those those those and I thought damn I should have fucking I should have
01:36:57 stayed in academia and got my master's degree I should have fucking made something of myself
01:37:04 now just watch 60 symbols and deep sky videos and sigh and think this could have been me
01:37:09 I don't even know what that is oh it's um it's youtube channels um
01:37:17 have you have you seen those there's a lot of youtube channels that do this um number file
01:37:23 does this um like a lot there's that blonde guy brady harrin or harrish harrish something
01:37:31 that's the number guy of file guy yeah he he's just this he's just this he's like oh like he just
01:37:35 like he just interviews professors and asks them questions and like it goes on number file or it
01:37:39 goes on 60 symbols or it goes on deep sky or um there's the professor the chemistry professor guy
01:37:46 who has like the funny like white curly hair um but yeah um I'll just I'll just have a quick look
01:37:55 I'm not not super familiar they um they're just videos where they just go to a university
01:38:04 and they'll find like a cool professor and they'll just ask them a bunch of questions about like
01:38:09 a specific galaxy or a specific star or a specific black hole or something and they'll
01:38:15 just talk about it it's just interesting cool stuff and like they'll they'll show off like some
01:38:19 of the science that they personally did sometimes um and it's just I don't know I I like this content
01:38:26 this is my nerdy shit that I meant to um that's interesting no I haven't seen what what is the
01:38:35 M number stand for is that like a Messier Messier Messier Messier objects that's yeah Messier was a
01:38:44 guy who had a telescope 100 years maybe 200 years ago who just pointed at the sky and it's like these
01:38:51 are stars but this thing's blurry I don't know what the fuck this is is it a cloud is it a shroud
01:38:57 we'll never know and then some of those things turned out to be nebulous some of them turned out
01:39:01 to be galaxies um yeah or other stuff so did he number them yeah yes he he just made note he made
01:39:09 note of just a whole bunch of things in the sky that he didn't know what they were and then they
01:39:14 were the Messier objects and then people eventually figured out them and so now they're called like
01:39:20 oh m m 72 m 88 or whatever yeah oh yeah one is the the bode's galaxy or something such and said
01:39:29 the the kiwi fruit galaxy I've never seen that before yeah I guess I guess I have a neighbor I
01:39:35 guess if there's been oh wow like some of these videos are quite old yeah I don't upload super
01:39:39 frequently which is good I like subscribing to channels there's only so many Messier objects
01:39:45 Messier objects I'm not actually maybe you're maybe I'm saying it wrong Messier Messier
01:39:50 I don't know I I enjoy channels that make good content and upload not too frequently
01:39:57 because then my sub box is clear but there's only good stuff yeah I like I like a good channel
01:40:04 that uploads uh you know four times a year but each time it's like a big good video that I want to
01:40:13 watch yeah these videos are very chill they're like just comfy space is freaky I was a little
01:40:26 disappointed to look at my uh analytics I looked at my youtube analytics just yesterday
01:40:33 and I looked at the I looked at the the money I looked at the money that my videos make and I
01:40:41 I I compared them all and I figured out like a roughly they do all make about the same amount
01:40:49 of money like per view like give or take and it was way less than I thought it was like
01:40:57 less it was like less than a dollar per like 2000 views is what it worked out to
01:41:03 huh that's that's low I thought that was low I thought it was more like a dollar per thousand
01:41:09 no not so yeah your cpm is like around 50 cents or lower than
01:41:15 yeah I guess so my cpm when I was doing the my little pony animations on nightfall studios was
01:41:23 like 20 cents it was really bad like 5000 views would be a dollar um it wasn't great I remember
01:41:33 looking at my thing like not too long ago and it was higher than that it's different for everyone
01:41:40 but why does it change what what does it mean a huge portion is watch time um yeah channels that
01:41:48 like are advertiser friendly and have good watch time will get as high as five cpm like 10 times
01:41:54 what I had so like they could get like five dollars per thousand views rather than like 50 cents or
01:41:59 less um like so channels like mystery beast for example get ridiculously high cpm so they don't
01:42:06 not only do I get like tens of millions of views per video but they also get like really high money
01:42:12 per view more than other people it's fucked how dare they okay so I'm I'm looking at my
01:42:20 hypocrite channel and it says 645 6.45 dollars cpm your playback base cpm wait 6.4 it's not point
01:42:33 six dollars is your cpm six is that super high whoa my i don't know okay my playback based cpm
01:42:47 it's telling me it's like seven or eight yeah seven or eight dollars
01:42:53 that's wait well that's that's really high then that's not that's not right if I feel like the
01:43:01 number is like a different type of number that it's showing us and not the one you were talking
01:43:05 about like it looks like maybe yeah like playback based cpm what is playback based I mean what is
01:43:12 excluding I'll hover over that thing it says playback based cpm means effective playback
01:43:18 based cost per mile and tells you how much advertisers paid per thousand monetized playbacks
01:43:26 oh for monetized playbacks so it doesn't count playbacks if it weren't monetized
01:43:31 to calculate your playback based cpm the total revenue from ads is divided by estimated monetized
01:43:37 playbacks an estimated monetized playback happens when a viewer sees at least one ad
01:43:42 impression when watching one of your videos okay so that's like when you have an ad how
01:43:46 much you get but so like for all the people using ad blocker that number goes down a lot oh okay so
01:43:53 it's seven or eight dollars per thousand times the ad was shown not times the video was viewed
01:44:02 okay yeah I usually think of um so is that what rpm is okay so yeah yeah rpm oh yeah damn rpm means
01:44:12 revenue per per mil and tells you how much you earned per thousand views which for me is still
01:44:18 four dollars and ninety three cents which still is not right because uh I mean let me just uh pick
01:44:25 out uh okay uh so literally ad blocker taking two ferd of my right two ferds of my revenue
01:44:31 that's what this shows me that's uh son sonichu 102 advanced christary has almost 200 k views it has
01:44:44 192 k views estimated revenue is just a little over a thousand dollars so that's did I do the math
01:44:57 wrong am I stupid uh that's a certainty oh yeah I'm asking the wrong questions okay a thousand
01:45:06 dollars divided by 200 that's by 200 000 is five point is zero point zero zero five so isn't it saying
01:45:23 is it saying oh yeah did you divide the wrong number by the wrong number oh I should I should have been
01:45:30 oh because it because it's because it's cost per mil revenue per mil so it should it should
01:45:36 have been just divided by 200 no it says no it says mile it says mile not million yeah
01:45:44 yeah but it means yeah but it means that means a thousand yeah okay so instead of dividing by 200
01:45:49 thousand I should divide by 200 which gives me five dollars what am I wrong do I make five
01:45:58 dollars per thousand views am I a genius of revenue I mean the it's a long video so the watch time is
01:46:05 probably good huh right yeah looking at my my given gaming channel where I've been like posting streams
01:46:14 playback based cpm is huge I guess because it's like a really long video yeah watch yeah I know
01:46:23 watch time is wow okay I guess I miscalculated I guess I miscalculated and actually uh yeah for
01:46:32 two 200 000 views I made a thousand dollars so that's actually for every for every 200 views
01:46:43 for every 100 views I make half of yeah make fun yeah okay I guess it's five dollars per million
01:46:51 cool uh it's still not it's still not enough I want more thanks
01:47:01 I was actually looking at my my twitch um revenue uh recently and apparently I made like 70 bucks
01:47:10 from just bit donations just people throwing bits I mean that's enough to pay for Elden Ring
01:47:18 so I think that's a that's a good thing that's money well spent that's time well spent streaming that
01:47:23 yeah I I don't really it seems like people be streaming these days what I mean it's true what I
01:47:34 mean is that I see it feels like I see lots of people that are streamers and are making money at it
01:47:41 like I that number has gone up and it makes me wonder if maybe I should have streamed more
01:47:50 maybe I should have not quit streaming so much
01:47:55 uh sure I mean why not why not just go back and do some why not do some right now I don't know it
01:48:03 sounds hard and I feel like I've got stuff to do I mean I also have stuff to do but I I
01:48:11 dedicate like time to it but I think did I talk about like trying to schedule things last time
01:48:18 I think I did like trying to schedule working on Pumpkin Alley Elden Ring streams and like Clarissa
01:48:25 Gunsmoke stuff did I talk about that uh I think you did I think I remember I never a big talk
01:48:37 about closer Gunsmoke on the last episode yeah and like I've I've cordoned off my my weekdays
01:48:45 and like okay I'm gonna spend this day this amount of hours uh and this with this many breaks doing
01:48:53 like work either Clarissa or Pumpkin Alley and then one day a week I can stream Elden Ring for like
01:48:59 as long as I feel like I did the other day for like almost eight hours well I feel like eight
01:49:05 hours is too long because I got very irritable near the end when I last and I said the game sucked
01:49:13 and then I got really angry again and uh but yeah it's it's possible to do streams regularly
01:49:23 and still make progress on other things it's just I'm sure I'm not sure it is not letting
01:49:28 not letting your week get away from you if you if you keep track of like the time you're spending
01:49:34 on any given thing and just like saying okay this is the day I try this and that so that every week
01:49:41 you're getting a little bit of all of your projects done yeah I'm I just um it always feels like it
01:49:54 eats up my whole day whenever I stream I guess there's probably things ways I could mitigate that
01:50:01 if I had discipline I mean I have I was just streaming for a while like whenever I felt like
01:50:11 I have a few hours in a row I'll just stream now sometimes it was early in the morning sometimes
01:50:17 it was late and uh it's not a smart idea if I want like viewers because people are awake
01:50:25 at certain times and it's better if I stream at certain times I just couldn't be bothered to figure
01:50:30 that out so I just turned it on I streamed for a bit and people who showed up had a fun time
01:50:38 and I stopped and it's like it's not the way to build a streaming empire exactly I maxed out at
01:50:45 like nine viewers and it's like not a big thing but you know it's fun so and it's it's basically
01:50:53 the same as if I was not streaming because I'm just playing the game and occasionally speaking
01:51:00 I'm saying funny jokes and it's fun hanging out with the chat it's like it's not like a tedious
01:51:06 work sort of thing maybe I should have maybe I should have streamed more of the time I was playing
01:51:11 Noida or playing Hades maybe I should stream some Hades sometime yeah you could do that I could do
01:51:18 that I feel like I always say maybe I should do such and such and then I never do it I feel stupid
01:51:26 even suggesting that I might do something because of course I won't I mean maybe you feel more
01:51:32 pressure to like perform as a streamer than I do yeah maybe I don't know maybe I feel like sometimes
01:51:41 I'm a little too lax and I don't try to make it like a show and so like people often say that my
01:51:50 streams are like really like chill and comforting in a way that they can just sort of have it in
01:51:56 the background which is nice but it definitely means that I'm not like exciting I'm not like an
01:52:01 exciting streamer what I know how I am I haven't streamed enough to figure out what I'm like
01:52:16 generally yeah I think I saw your one where you played our games I think that's the only
01:52:23 live stream of yours that I've that I've caught I've barely live streamed in my life so that
01:52:29 makes sense okay nice for me like I need people with me on my own I feel like I would just be
01:52:38 boring as fuck having people with you to like like one person playing the game and one person
01:52:43 respond to chat is a is a good it's not always feasible but it's a good formula it's yeah it's
01:52:49 it's I feel I feel very at ease when we're doing like a heckles for shackles shackles for heckles
01:52:55 thing yeah yeah or it's just sort of like we're just hanging out in the minecraft server and sort
01:53:02 of kind of I'm kind of mining but I'm not on screen so I don't have to worry about my screen
01:53:06 being like entertaining I just talk for sure jokes for sure yeah it is you it is it is a good time
01:53:15 I just just getting myself in the I have a big it's real it's real work for me to like psych
01:53:27 myself up and like get myself in the the attitude of like I'm going to stream I'm going to do something
01:53:36 even though it's like stupid and like what is what I'm actually doing is something that is not
01:53:41 difficult at all
01:53:46 yeah I don't know I feel like I have had that before I think I I just sort of I get over it or have
01:53:56 gotten over it because it doesn't really happen anymore by just like setting getting it live
01:54:02 before I really think about it it's like okay I'm live uh well I'm doing it now
01:54:09 and then I just do it that's right it's the same way like sending emails like if I look at the email
01:54:17 and it's like this isn't good they're gonna think I'm an idiot
01:54:21 I won't send it but if I just send it before it's ready then it was ready the whole time
01:54:27 it's not a problem I know what you mean
01:54:36 and yet I don't it's it's it's it's it's it's it's jumping into like a Dark Souls boss
01:54:44 before you've considered whether it was a good idea to do that it's it's it's just it's the do it
01:54:52 the fucking do it thing bad idea or not like the no brain head empty sort of approach
01:54:59 because it's it's a good way to get started on something
01:55:04 I like the approach I do it often as much as I can because I often overthink things to
01:55:10 ridiculous degrees it's a very uh paralyzing mindset where I'm like well I'm not ready yet so
01:55:19 but then if I just fucking do something without thinking no knowing that it is probably a bad
01:55:25 idea just head empty do it um it works out because I was underestimating myself usually
01:55:35 yep
01:55:39 I haven't learned anything I didn't learn anything you just got to utilize your
01:55:47 COVID brain fog he's gonna make it work for me yeah yeah hmm uh I I just um
01:55:58 whoa excuse me the cat the cat has been screaming it's probably picked up on the audio
01:56:03 the discord won't be picking it up but it'll be in the recording probably
01:56:06 I think good is for it's her food time I'm going to feed the cat and be right back wow okay
01:56:14 excellent um uh hold on I'm messaging a guy about I'm messaging a guy about the dojin
01:56:23 and uh I think he seems too expensive
01:56:29 oh right yeah you you had that list of potential other people I found three
01:56:39 dudes I think they're dudes on uh on uh tapas and I thought maybe one of these guys could do
01:56:46 the rest because I think it's been waiting a while for kaiju I think that's that's probably not
01:56:52 gonna happen so uh I just I just got a response back from this one guy and he he gave me his
01:57:00 rates page and uh the rates page seems to imply that he might want to charge like $100 per page
01:57:09 and that's a lot and I don't know if I am willing to pay that much honestly how many pages is this
01:57:18 the thing um there are 13 pages and a cover to be to be drawn I think it's something like that
01:57:30 that's more than the other guys wanted so I mean I feel like a hundred bucks a pay I mean if it's
01:57:37 really good like I I glanced at the people you you you posted I didn't really look too close
01:57:45 yeah 100 bucks for a whole page it's not insane no I don't think it's like a terrible
01:57:55 option but I I don't know what we budget we have all the other guys that I asked
01:58:02 said they would who do we ask that we asked um michi and uh kaiju and ed and they all said
01:58:12 that their rates were significantly below that so I don't know what what makes this guy think he's
01:58:19 so fucking special that's mean um but I don't know it's just uh it doesn't seem like a very cost
01:58:28 effective option none of these guys were a perfect match I was disappointed that I just can't it's
01:58:34 it's I can't find I can't find anyone who draws quite in this particular way
01:58:44 it's I guess that's normal I guess no no two are like uh yeah but it's like it's sort of a popular
01:58:53 ish I look at it yeah sort of thing like it doesn't look people would want to try like that it doesn't
01:58:59 look too unusual like it doesn't look like something that I've never seen before and yet
01:59:05 I cannot find anyone who whom who matches it and I I don't know what's I don't know what's going on
01:59:14 with that well give me a give me a few years I'll go to anime school and I'll figure out how to draw
01:59:19 like that I just uh you know I got I got I got half of it drawn by that guy curse him
01:59:30 and now it's like well I can't just I can't just throw these out and not use them and just like
01:59:36 pay someone else to do it from scratch like I I can't I can't bring myself to do that
01:59:42 can I can I see like what the art looks like a little bit yeah I want to show
01:59:50 sure sure sure please a brilliant full heck I'll post it you have you have the connections you're
01:59:55 you're the art like I spider I can't think of what what the art like you got all of the lines
02:00:01 connecting all the people I did not I did not ask Mary whether I forgot to do that I instead
02:00:09 I went on tapas and just tried to like look through like recent posts to like see oh that's
02:00:13 gonna be harder I know but I wanted to here these are what these are what the existing pages look
02:00:22 like whoa yeah it's so kawaii it's pretty kawaii damn I like it I guess it's pretty good paint
02:00:32 no this was not drawn by never paint this was written by never paint okay I see I was gonna say
02:00:38 that everything's already written yeah and and it's just the drawing yeah it was never paint
02:00:46 aura barista and chip wiseman I yeah we're the three they wrote the scripts for it for these
02:00:54 chip is a wiseman it's true yeah so so this is what I'm looking for and I just it's it's proved
02:01:03 surprisingly hard to find some of the draws quite like it there was one I found one a furry comic
02:01:13 artist who was a little bit similar but I they're like they have like a kind of big patron and I
02:01:19 was like this person is not gonna yeah this person is going to charge too much this person's
02:01:24 gonna cost this is gonna be expensive because they're like an edgy they're like an edgy
02:01:29 artist and I'm sure they charge out the wazoo for that shit I follow like I don't want artists who
02:01:37 sort of has a manga-ish style it's not the same as visfo yeah they also draw boobs
02:01:45 well they link to a capacitive page with the links broken so oh bummer
02:01:55 I don't know what's up with that at this point I'm like I'm not gonna find a perfect match
02:02:02 so I don't know I'm just trying to do the best I can find something find somebody
02:02:10 man whatever
02:02:15 yeah this artist is like the closest I got out of the people I follow and yeah I don't know how
02:02:20 well it would work I mean they're not like they don't let me I don't get the impression they're
02:02:23 making mega monies but I don't see a patreon okay they have 30,000 followers which is in a crazy
02:02:34 amount it's a lot though and this is good this is like it could fit very well into what we already
02:02:42 have this is it's it's yeah I mean it's not exactly the same but it's not much further off than the
02:02:50 ones that I had picked out on tapas so I might actually might actually ask this this person
02:02:58 are they on twitter yeah I leave my twitter was their twitter as well I have a lot more art on
02:03:03 twitter I think the question is can you convince them to draw something other than massive tits
02:03:15 yeah these are these are not these are not what we're looking for for this particular
02:03:22 project
02:03:30 I mean we all have to make sacrifices the boobs did just get bigger in the second half
02:03:36 and explicitly yeah yeah I'm not I'm not sure turn the page completely different I'm not I'm not
02:03:42 sure if they'd be interested in uh in what I'm asking them to do here also yeah they're tapas link
02:03:48 oh it's it cuts off into a dot dot dot and the link it's just like it's just broken that blows
02:03:57 you should uh would it not work to google their name or search in tapas it probably it probably would
02:04:03 oh I found it right I I found the link I use google I assume what's w I'm assuming it said
02:04:09 what's up and the character's called marina and from that I was able to find it yeah well they
02:04:16 they should fix their link what's the fuck up they should fix their link for real
02:04:24 I think I think I have a feeling that this person probably has more lucrative things to be doing
02:04:34 but maybe I'll ask but maybe I'll ask I don't see a patreon maybe if you maybe money if you just
02:04:39 wave it at them couldn't hurt hmm yeah I couldn't hurt to ask yeah this is pretty I would say this
02:04:49 is close enough but it's worth asking uh this other guy this other guy mo I don't know if I want to
02:04:56 pay a hundred dollars a page that's just yeah okay well that's uh that's one thing I was uh
02:05:07 that's yet another struggle I've been having this week add it to the pile
02:05:15 um all right I don't know just like in pokemon when you struggle you hurt yourself exactly
02:05:25 uh I think I'm out I'm out of things to say and voice voice fail time voice
02:05:33 voice fail time if you're if you're ready uh well I guess I don't really have anything to say
02:05:41 I just wanted to mention Clarissa Gunsmoke because I just like her dude she's so cute
02:05:46 I gotta draw her big old teddies one day oh my god wait please do and a big fucking hat
02:05:54 I don't think she has big fucking hat does she have she's not big old teddies does she
02:05:59 no no she she's moderately sized that's what I thought that's what I thought we'll explain
02:06:06 it she shoots her gun too hard and it makes her boobs just get bigger like inexplicably sure
02:06:11 that makes why not she just gets so shocked her tits go boinga that makes that makes sense to me
02:06:18 there's an argument in big booby mommy milkers over something like that I posted an image where
02:06:23 that happened someone it was I just found some abreast expansion comic where someone fired a gun
02:06:28 and their boobs just became huge instantly yeah I didn't understand the context the context of like
02:06:35 how it worked it seemed like they were so surprised the loud sound that their boobs got expanded yeah
02:06:43 sure just whatever just startle if if if your woman's too small just startle her
02:06:49 uh that's all it takes
02:06:53 uh okay as far as I know that's true a bunch of ghosts up in your house give
02:07:00 a little little cardboard cutouts of ghosts you'll never see it coming you'll
02:07:04 but but you'll achieve your dreams true yes I'll I'll draw more load of ghosts and be scared at every
02:07:12 panel I wish like freak myself out
02:07:19 the arguments that happen in big booby mommy milkers are really funny
02:07:23 because they're never like serious it's just like it's it's almost always entirely cosme because
02:07:27 we're just is like is a is a is a stick in the mud a grump who's always moaning about whatever
02:07:35 image people are excited about it's like that doesn't make sense oh it's like samus with big boobs
02:07:41 samus doesn't have big boobs you can't do that it's like right you can't you can't and it's true you
02:07:47 can't you can't we love them though that's pretty funny um but but they'll they'll also like contradict
02:07:54 themselves because like later on they'll be like an image what they do like I never I can't read
02:07:59 them I can't understand them I hope they're having a good time though uh you know what
02:08:08 you know what yeah glad they're having a good time glad everybody's having fun keeping it funny
02:08:14 um we're just being funny do you want to do the do the first voicemail sure
02:08:21 okay let me let me let me get it here there is not an unreasonable amount uh this week there's a
02:08:28 normal amount um finally finally uh let me see here
02:08:38 where uh which where was the first one oh my god uh yes uploaded today
02:08:47 oh they're all out of order no you know I I found myself saying oh my god with like that accent
02:08:55 once and I'm like oh shit this is too much I'm losing all my britishisms I'm losing my accent
02:09:01 like like entirely I should not ever say god is that an american thing well it's just like to
02:09:09 to say god but with an ah instead of an oh oh I guess I just don't even think about it oh yeah
02:09:16 this is it oh my god oh my oh my god oh my god e-gads e-gads it's uh professor e-gads like I just
02:09:26 felt so I felt so dirty hearing an american come out of my mouth uh you'd rather have an american
02:09:35 come in your mouth oh i was saying only if she's got only if she's got big balls and it has to be a woman
02:09:46 okay true all right the first voicemail I posted it there it's called Gib should do a page two
02:09:56 three two one go hello I just read the ben sink drawn tales gets troll page and I just want to
02:10:05 call in to say it is really cool really good very awesome a lot of great arts thank you I especially
02:10:13 love the piece of art of the devil sitting on his like a rocky throne and like fire all around him
02:10:21 yeah fucking sick that was that was the piece job and the resistance uh yeah I uh put a lot of work
02:10:29 put a lot of work on the page and I liked how it came out uh well the title is linked in the last
02:10:34 episode I think they put it in the description all right I I assumed it was I thought it was I mean
02:10:41 maybe it was on twitter you tweeted about it wait I'm sure now now I'm gonna hold on hold on maybe
02:10:47 you did I might I didn't finish listening to that episode yet I got like most of the way through
02:10:52 I think I put it in the show notes hold on in any event now I gotta in any event the uh I I don't
02:11:02 know whether I would be good for drawing uh tales gets trolled mostly because I'm not caught up
02:11:10 I had to I had to catch up yeah I have to catch up oh yeah it's the first link and I feel I mean
02:11:16 I I wouldn't be I wouldn't say no but I feel like the I don't know I think me being friends with Ben
02:11:25 is not necessarily a way in to that um I don't know I think I think it went live without the link
02:11:33 and then I quickly added it um maybe give I'll be honest they didn't I knew going in that they
02:11:42 weren't gonna pay me that much like frankly they they didn't they didn't pay me uh enough to compensate
02:11:50 for the amount of work that I put into that page but caveat is that I didn't really expect them to
02:11:57 like oh yeah it's not a money thing I knew what I would be cool to do it I guess I just I guess I
02:12:03 don't really put myself out there for these sorts of things too often oh if you I would I would feel
02:12:08 weird to be like oh what if I draw like um de-whelmingly well if you wanted to you could ask Cece and uh
02:12:18 I suppose I could um but that's but that's up to you oh oh you know actually on that subject uh
02:12:26 funny drama happened in the tales gets trolled server oh yeah I saw a tweet from Cece on the
02:12:35 the tales gets trolled thing I didn't know what it was about somebody had left it's um
02:12:40 it's but yeah okay so laserbot is the guy but also embergram embergram is laserbots older brother
02:12:48 and they basically wrote the story together and their younger brother shomo is also involved
02:12:56 but so they have us an outline they have an outline that the two the two of them came up with
02:13:01 an embergram's job has been to go through the outline and make actually write out like the
02:13:08 individual scripts for each page like I was given a craig like I was given a script that was written
02:13:17 by embergram and told like make this into a page please um and so embergram had I don't know he got
02:13:27 upset about something I guess someone was criticizing his like the way that he lays
02:13:34 fucking fuck off craig I guess the the way that he the way that he lays his his scripts out because
02:13:39 he does like format them very weirdly I was able to figure it out but he got mad at someone maybe
02:13:44 laserbot like criticizing the way that he lays out his scripts he wanted to be able to kick people
02:13:52 from the server for talking back to him or whatever CC would not give him permission to do that
02:13:59 and so embergram like quit in a huff he's like I'm out I'm leaving the project and uh which is a
02:14:07 bummer uh because he did have a bunch of there were a bunch of like plot ideas that he had come up with
02:14:14 that he hadn't told anyone so no yeah so this it might affect the story a bit which is sad
02:14:22 he might you know laser bothers though they are brothers laserbot left before and then he came
02:14:27 back so I mean maybe embergram can be convinced to come back but I think for now uh laserbot and
02:14:32 maybe shomo are doing the scripts now I'm not really sure what they're gonna do but someone's
02:14:38 gotta have to do that but so yeah there was this whole stupid like fallout thing embergram
02:14:44 I think laser embergram left and then laserbot left but I think laserbot he's not really gone
02:14:49 he just left the server like in solidarity or something I don't know um those guys are pretty
02:14:58 funny well definitely cool reading this page as I'm as I'm scrolling down towards for satan but
02:15:06 the embers are rising up and it feels almost animated as I read it thank you very much
02:15:12 yeah I thought it was an animation for a second they're like whoa the embers are going up
02:15:16 and I know that's just me scrolling oh I see yeah yeah you kind of descend you kind of descend
02:15:22 down into the darkness and as you scroll down with more embers kind of start yeah that's cool
02:15:28 wafting upwards good yeah thank you um I liked uh I liked I liked uh drawing it I had fun with it
02:15:40 and then um yeah maybe maybe I'll do another one at some point it was a lot of work so I wouldn't
02:15:46 do one all the time but uh they gave me they gave me a little more than they usually pay
02:15:53 because I they gave they they gave um they gave me a little extra like apparently they also gave
02:16:00 some extra to uh what are the guy the guy Rocco and uh Robonod I think the other some two other
02:16:07 artists who like did like really fancy work they gave me the fancy the fancy rate so I
02:16:14 appreciated that oh that's nice yeah um you're a fancy boy cc thank thank you cc appreciate it
02:16:23 okay anyway let's uh let's get the next one here uh
02:16:29 the next voicemail is called uh killer prints 9 30 there it is okay three two one go
02:16:39 so I've been watching the layer half of the body cast on the top land the arc and it's
02:16:47 been kind of frustrating as I disagree with most of what Gib and Nate say as you will read weekly
02:16:53 and fan subs fan subs yeah it's kind of retired I mean still the please don't cancel me
02:17:05 well what's the disagree he didn't even say what the disagreement was
02:17:11 yeah it was what did you mention about one piece he said he said the something land arc
02:17:19 he said he disagreed with a lot of what you were saying as he was reading
02:17:25 scan lations maybe he was just disagreeing with the reading of scan lations instead of the official
02:17:33 he just said he disagreed with you but he didn't he didn't elaborate uh all right the next one is
02:17:39 a question top 10 voicemail characters um uh I think there's conflict of interest with me I won't
02:17:47 give my answers I mean I'll wait wait wait no this is this is not uh this is not don't listen to that
02:17:54 one that's the next voicemail um top 10 voicemail I mean I would have to give it to them I'd have
02:18:01 to give it to them I'd have to give it to them snakes yeah okay cringis bingus I guess I would say
02:18:07 the samurai is a classic of course um that's three I'm not really putting them in order I was just
02:18:14 trying to think of 10 because like uh there's a lot but like I don't remember oh yeah my ass batman
02:18:23 oh yeah oh sure yeah riddle my ass batman haven't heard from him in a while um ever ever since I saw
02:18:30 him in real life yeah he's he's changed from a voicemail into a person yeah that's true um
02:18:41 I'm trying to I'm trying I feel there's probably I probably feel bad later someone will point out
02:18:46 to me a bunch of really obvious choices that didn't jump to mine immediately I mean uh I guess I could
02:18:53 like give my top five that aren't me and then my own like five that I enjoyed the most that I made
02:19:01 to avoid bias spotting I do yeah please whoever the fuck I don't even know if this counts as a
02:19:08 character the guy who sends in like fucking songs every other week that guy fucking rules yeah I
02:19:13 consider him I consider him like just a person I wasn't thinking of him as a character but yeah yeah
02:19:20 riddle my ass batman was pretty funny I'm trying the samurai definitely I like the samurai yeah
02:19:28 at all the whole arc yeah um it's hard for me to think of characters because most of the ones I
02:19:34 think I made yeah um uh were you the entire league of night fuckers or was that multiple
02:19:43 I was most of them um initially like I started sending them in less and I eventually I stopped
02:19:50 but other people kept sending them in I like stopped right before you started skipping them um
02:19:57 so that worked out for me none of mine got skipped wait we started skipping them
02:20:02 yeah the joke was just they were just they were just loud and they were just like loud and like
02:20:08 breathing and like yeah like people would just call in and like hello I'm the the butt wizard uh I
02:20:14 have riddles free which PCP do I want to pee or in or some shit and you're just like to be like
02:20:20 yeah this is a night fucker I don't fucking care you just turn it off that's right that's right
02:20:25 that's right I mean me and far as like created like a formula that was too easy to emulate
02:20:31 and everyone was just no one was innovating um that's right you gotta you gotta iterate right
02:20:38 progress it's about progress um I guess I'm glad you mentioned Ben snakes if he were alive he would
02:20:46 be very grateful fuck I'm a standard him a shit uh Ben snakes is my top number one for sure there's
02:20:56 no there's no question um I'm gonna put the voice filter on for that uh audience will hear it
02:21:04 all right well guess what if I didn't name you then your character sucks and I don't even remember
02:21:09 it so fuck you my favorite characters I've done uh aside I guess like I like them snakes obviously
02:21:16 I like close to my kitchen I does it count if it's like a character I made that I had someone else
02:21:21 voice like I wrote a script and directed them I don't know well sure it still counts as a thing
02:21:26 you can choose lost tapes archive is my favorite thing in general I've done because I just like
02:21:32 how surreal it is and like those were so weird I was so like confused and they felt so mysterious
02:21:40 because I had no idea who was doing it and they were so like sporadic it would just be suddenly
02:21:45 a new tape and I guess I guess that is like what the fuck is that I guess that is a character
02:21:52 yeah I mean like the tapekeeper is the character so like he was played by four eyes but like I
02:21:58 you know scripted him sort of how did you do all of them like all of the PCP members I didn't get
02:22:04 to I wanted to but like um I my work was fucking me up after a while um of pencilmation and then
02:22:13 people really ruined everything and then people started leaving the podcast so I had I had one
02:22:20 planned for you Gib I had one for Jesse I was waiting for mine yeah I I had a few different ideas for
02:22:27 you um uh I don't know it's maybe maybe I would have um I probably maybe I would have gone with the
02:22:36 the Ann Moon Anions thing that I ended up doing into a Nate fucker maybe it would have been something
02:22:40 like that um mainly Moon Anions and the Moon Anions I fucking love that video so much um
02:22:48 ah what was I what was it Moon Anions are the mainly Moon Anions are the main aliens we finding
02:22:54 shall be yeah woasts uh great that was that was fun I love the classic Gib content um rare characters
02:23:03 ones that I don't think I've mentioned uh double double Satan Satan um that almost became like a
02:23:09 series um I I don't I have the vaguest recollection it's like hello hello I I am am double double
02:23:19 Satan Satan he just says every word twice um and then he likes he says fuck you Ben because
02:23:24 every voicemail character hates Ben that's like that's just the meta I guess um yeah sure and I
02:23:31 was gonna continue it to where he like interviews triple Satan and then um Infinity Jesus um and
02:23:37 like triple Joker would like be in the background and like just a bunch of like characters or like
02:23:41 1.5 um like Buddha or something that's a pretty good that's a pretty good bit I would have been
02:23:47 pretty yeah yeah I had a bunch of ideas um I do I do recall but I think you just made like one
02:23:54 double satan email yeah there was only yeah there's only ever one I'm gonna do just an anomaly
02:23:58 yeah so like there's gonna be the Vemsnakes compilation the Lost Tapes compilation cluster
02:24:03 pun kitchen compilation then there'll be a general Nate fucker compilation which I'm gonna
02:24:08 include other people's as well or at least the ones I think are good but mostly or maybe maybe
02:24:13 I'll do all of mine and then like other people's or something I don't know and then maybe a
02:24:18 miscellaneous there was one I wanted to do Morph as well which was the audio demon I think I did
02:24:22 one of those in 2019 back when I was editing the podcast it's the the goal for that one
02:24:29 is that I would like put a voice effect on a random pcp member um so I cursed Ben St with
02:24:34 flanger and your voice was like for like a minute after the voicemail ended
02:24:41 uh I see I see uh wait did I not listen back to that one so I never heard that
02:24:49 possibly it was it was oh no it was in 2019 I'm sure I could find it um I mean if I do a compilation
02:24:55 I'm with the compilation I'm debating do I just have the raw audio or do I have like
02:25:00 from the pcp everyone's reactions um maybe I'll do both I don't know that's more work
02:25:06 yeah maybe for that one I'll do it since like that like your everyone's reaction was part of
02:25:11 the voicemail like that was like the point um but yeah I was gonna do a bunch like I'd call in
02:25:18 someone gets incomprehensible reverb where I put reverb on their voice and then I delete the dry
02:25:22 track so you just hear like faint echoing and shit um you can't understand that I was gonna
02:25:28 do like a bunch but then um I was close to when I stopped editing so I'm like well if I I'm not
02:25:34 the editor of this bit doesn't really work you can't do anything yeah I mean like I could trust
02:25:39 I could maybe hope that the person editing does a good job but like they probably wouldn't do it
02:25:44 the way I think would be funniest because I'm very picky right right true yeah it's tough uh it's
02:25:51 tough one it's tough bit I guess the best if I had to pick requires a true the touch of a true
02:25:57 artist I think to make it if I narrowing it all down if I had to pick the one voicemail out of
02:26:03 all the things I've done that I think on its own is the best it's really tough but I think this the
02:26:10 smeagle Nate fucker voicemail really it it's just so yeah I mean it's yeah it's just so
02:26:22 comfortable and the impression that 4a's did was too fucking good it was variant yeah that's
02:26:30 that's the word I can't really remember like this I can I remember like I remember being
02:26:35 Nate fucker's generally viscerally uncomfortable no I remember the smeagle one as being like viscerally
02:26:41 unsettling describes in in great detail what he's gonna do yeah it just it just sounds like it's
02:26:52 straight out of the fucking movie because I put like ambience and like I found like soundtrack
02:26:58 from the film to like work of it and everything could you could you put like could you edit like
02:27:05 clips of the film so that it's that it looks like he's saying it oh god uh oh maybe geez like maybe
02:27:15 it could as like a standalone thing for any figure compilation I'm probably gonna like commission
02:27:20 unless I drop myself like an artist to show like Nate like like running away from like this this
02:27:25 this like army of like unspeakable creatures and he's just running like with fear in his eyes
02:27:35 or in his sunglasses I love that those were those were some that was some fucked up some fucked up
02:27:44 shit once the compilations out I'm gonna force Nate to do a video where he listens to it
02:27:51 you should force Nate to do that absolutely uh he needs to be he needs to be whipped into shape
02:27:58 and he needs to be held accountable uh okay uh yeah I'm sorry I can't I can't even think of 10
02:28:07 I can't think of 10 maybe between us even with my own I can't think of 10 I can think of like
02:28:11 yeah five or six uh turns out that there's not that many good voicemailers oh no voicemails
02:28:18 were bad all maybe just not memorable enough yeah um my individual voicemails can be good
02:28:25 not one character is not as as frequent yeah what ones that I can like pick out and remember
02:28:31 and name them and be like oh yeah that that guy I remember that specific character oh Tommy Jay
02:28:37 I love that character Tommy Jay baby oh that guy who wouldn't stop voicemailing and I
02:28:43 went in the voice jail everyone in the voice jail is my favorite uh favorite character
02:28:49 next voicemail is called uh wait sorry did we skip this one no yeah we sorry yeah play the one
02:28:55 before um it's called garlic dis three two one go yeah well and I just changed your name to sewer
02:29:05 chats and they have like mixed song rules man except for all the verses thanks man I agree
02:29:13 Tom got all the non-rap parts and everyone's like oh wow Tom can actually sing I could
02:29:20 song they made me rap they forced me to rap it's not fair oh yours was like the 90s rap
02:29:27 sort of section mine it was funny mine mine sucked I knew it sucked it was fine uh it's okay I didn't
02:29:36 write it and if I did I would have made it bad on purpose so it would still be okay I don't remember
02:29:41 the lyrics but my heart tells me it was hello Brad you are bad and or so wait wait oh okay
02:29:50 I saw a comment on Kiwi Farms the other day that actually made me really laugh
02:29:56 it the guy he was he was mocking my verse he said that I sucked and like yeah true but he
02:30:03 but he he he was to make fun of to make fun of my rapping style he he like made up like oh
02:30:10 Ben St sounds like this and then he he he wrote a line and the line was like um wait it was uh
02:30:18 uh my name is Ben St and I'm here to say property is theft and traps aren't gay
02:30:28 like yeah true I wish I wish I could write that myself
02:30:33 but I can't because I'm too stupid uh so loved it well liking liking men is straight okay I mean
02:30:43 if if if that's you know I agree I uh if you read this you're a woman now
02:30:50 property property is theft uh it's a theft from the commons it's just belongs private property
02:30:56 belongs to to is the is should be exist for the benefit of all and that's distinct from personal
02:31:03 property by the way uh but we can we can get into that later oh people people don't know
02:31:08 but there's a distinction I didn't know there was a distinction yeah yeah I didn't realize um and
02:31:15 then I I don't know so I saw someone explain it and I was like oh okay yeah when when Mark
02:31:20 talks about private property he's talking about like factories farmland so on not like clothes
02:31:29 your house it's like my microwave right uh but it's easy to dunk it's easy to dunk if you pretend
02:31:37 if you don't know that there's a distinction or you pretend that there isn't so it's always a thing
02:31:42 I've said of leftists having some good ideas and then not explaining them to me in a way that I
02:31:49 understand and then no wonder I don't think they're good for a long time I I yeah and it's like well
02:31:58 if you well if you read marks like it's all there and that's true but I've been taught that it is
02:32:04 all there mark was to mark mark just wants to murder people that's what I was told he did yeah
02:32:09 yeah he uh he he you know he did the uh he did the holodomir and he killed uh you know
02:32:14 he killed all the kulaks uh in the russian revolution carl marx terrible dictator yeah
02:32:21 carl was a terrible terrible dictator carl barks woof he's a dog i'm a campus carl carl marx is in
02:32:29 assassins creed syndicate you can do many quests for him wait really that's probably very silly
02:32:37 i forget what it was it was something something like liberate this bit liberate this bitch do you
02:32:43 have to go and liberate this bit of london because he's in he was in london and it's like the london
02:32:48 assassins creed maybe do you have to go and like help protect like a union leader as they're like
02:32:54 striking against the factory or something like that the the bad guys are trying to crack down on
02:32:59 this union you got to go and assassinate everyone hell yeah damn good the that was a good game the
02:33:06 rights the rights of the proletariat's the arms must not be surrendered under any pretext
02:33:13 it was there was carl marx there was charles darwin there was some other guy charwin darwin
02:33:19 they were all there i saw i saw some i saw some dumb thing some dumb like anti leftist thing on
02:33:26 twitter it was a meme it was like you know the chad face or whatever and it was like one guy says
02:33:32 you know uh the workers have a right to anything they produce and then some smug the smug guy you're
02:33:40 supposed to agree with says like what if they produce at a net negative what if they produce
02:33:45 at a net negative what if they are unproductive then you know actually capital owners protect the
02:33:51 workers against you know uh business losses or something and i don't know uh that was like it's
02:33:57 like okay and every i saw a bunch of people that i follow were like god this is all in marx like
02:34:03 like like uh uh like make a critique of communism that isn't already addressed in the formative
02:34:11 challenge difficulty impossible if you just read marx like it's literally in there and it's like
02:34:16 yes no if i read marx i'm gonna take an axe and crack open jeff bezis's head like an egg and the
02:34:21 yolk's gonna spill out and then i'm gonna go to prison and i don't want that and on the one hand
02:34:27 i'm sure it is i'm sure it is in there i'm sure he probably did address that question somewhere
02:34:32 on the other hand i haven't read it i haven't read all of capital so like i couldn't i couldn't
02:34:39 have made that point i couldn't be like well actually marx has a rebuttal for exactly this uh
02:34:46 this thing uh but there is one apparently uh so i get it it's hard to explain simple things sometimes
02:34:54 i mean i mean the look like me in my brain if if like all the excess like earnings you have
02:35:03 aren't being siphoned off to some one guy at the top right then those earnings would be
02:35:10 with the workers and then they wouldn't need a person at top to like take a temporary loss for
02:35:16 you you'd have more money to tank it yourself right right they would have they would have it
02:35:21 in the first place yeah you would just already have like the means because you'd be earning more
02:35:27 so that it just seems like that would automatically correct for itself
02:35:31 it's not like magically like the person being having a ceo doesn't mean like more money magically
02:35:36 appears like i don't think so yeah somebody somebody's tank someone's got the money and
02:35:43 they're tanking the loss so it's just like well who someone so yeah so it's like oh well well but
02:35:53 this yeah it's kind of like saying oh but you see the fact oh the workers don't have the money
02:35:59 they didn't get the profit but that means they can't take the loss so actually it's good for them
02:36:03 it's like well it's like it's like i don't know about that i mean you can also just look i forget
02:36:09 which country it is that does have a decent number of worker cooperatives um their survival rate
02:36:15 like a typical business like i i i'm not gonna remember the exact number someone like 30 something
02:36:21 percent of typical businesses will last more than three years and the rest close down but with worker
02:36:26 co-ops it's like 87 survive the first three years wow they're way they're so much more resilient
02:36:34 that's very interesting yeah so that probably tells me that they're probably very good at
02:36:40 you know tanking those losses because it probably incentivizes the workers to like
02:36:45 because like if i know whether the risk is just the risk is distributed yeah and it's exactly like
02:36:53 i i haven't worked many normal jobs but i know people who do and they'll tell me like
02:36:58 like my partner used to work at starbucks my partner follows the book my partner tries to
02:37:01 do everything correctly and other people are just lazy but just sit around do nothing like their
02:37:06 whole shift do the bare minimum work don't care leave messes behind and just don't really try
02:37:12 and i hear it from other people i have another friend who works at a casino somewhere and they
02:37:16 have similar things like half the employees just don't give a shit they do the bare minimum
02:37:19 not to get fired and they don't care but like i feel like in a co-op everyone's incentivized
02:37:27 to do well because it means you get paid more because like your payments i assume it's more
02:37:32 like a percentage of earnings rather than just a flat rate i don't exactly i think maybe that's
02:37:39 how it works i don't know exactly but the point is like the business like the better the business
02:37:44 does the better you do it seems to be like the situation there so it makes sense that people
02:37:49 would actually give a shit and probably feel better about their work because they actually have
02:37:53 some control over it or something like that i feel like what would make you feel better about
02:37:58 your work is just getting a bigger paycheck i feel like just the fact that there's no big guy at
02:38:05 the top taking a lot of the money out of the company means that everybody gets more money which
02:38:10 means you're just happier in general and can work harder when you're a grunt you're like i mean
02:38:16 maybe there's like the possibility that you might if you do well you might get a promotion might get
02:38:22 a raise or something but like there's never any guarantee of that and for a lot of in a lot of
02:38:28 positions it's probably just not gonna happen so like yeah why try hard what's what's the reward
02:38:37 in that uh nothing most of the time a lot of the time um there are there are a lot of jobs that i
02:38:47 i would be like you might as well do the bare minimum you're like you're not getting anything
02:38:54 anything out of doing more so like why would it be expected of you oh my god i had to fucking
02:39:04 double take it's actually here 36 minutes ago your movie sucks the lion king part one holy
02:39:13 shit it's actually here no how how many hours is part one uh two hours 40 minutes and i think
02:39:21 there's gonna be free parts lemma maybe there'll be two that's great i can't wait to watch i've
02:39:30 been seeing the live stream clips for this for like for years for literally over two years
02:39:37 maybe coming closer for years same like and the stuff i've seen so far like i have not
02:39:43 watched 2019 lanking but holy fuck some of that shit that movie just fucks up like basic competence
02:39:49 like people's microphones clipping and like like bad like autotune on the singing like or like
02:39:55 audio being time stretched and having like noticeable artifacts and pops and shit it's
02:40:01 it's it was always amusing seeing those things because like i'm sure the movie is like
02:40:07 like fine well like not fine but like it's just it's just it's a series of images and
02:40:15 people like the lion king the original so they just say hey it's good and then everyone forgot
02:40:20 about it um and adam going through and finding endless like supplies of like things that are
02:40:29 wrong with it the more he dug it was like nobody would have ever like like it's it's i mean i
02:40:37 obviously haven't seen this video yet i don't know exactly what he's gonna talk about but like
02:40:42 like lion king 2019 is like not like the worst film in like the world in terms of like what it does
02:40:56 it's sort of like a trend that sucks of like just making like a like an old property but like new
02:41:04 and like just getting a bunch of money for it or just lazily putting it together returning
02:41:08 animation into live action yeah like a weird thing like that it's a stupid gimmick it's dumb
02:41:13 it's like hollywood's stupid and people are just dumb droves they go into the droves the thing but
02:41:18 like to deep dive on it you find so much more to hate and it's like nobody would have gotten this
02:41:27 mad about this if they hadn't been trying to make a review about it i can't wait to see how
02:41:32 upsetting it is i can't wait to see in front of the mouth by the end i haven't really been following
02:41:37 those live streams for like a year i only looked at like some of the highlight clips but there was
02:41:41 like actually like comical it's just comical like seeing like especially like seeing like the behind
02:41:46 the scenes interviews with john favreau being like yeah you know wanted to look like a nature
02:41:52 documentary um you know we don't want the characters to be expressive animators will
02:41:55 send me like a scene and it's like expressive and i'm like tell them no animals don't express
02:41:59 themselves you can't have the character emote you gotta tone it back and have their face look stiff
02:42:06 oh this person sent me a character and they made the sunset look beautiful and i spent all this
02:42:10 time putting these nice clouds in the sky and it was really aesthetic but in real life a cloud
02:42:16 the sky's boring you can't do that oh my god things like that it's like so funny in real life the
02:42:24 sky can be nice sometimes like like no nothing nothing can be idealized like pure realism is
02:42:32 what we need like no idealism at all nothing none of that it's just like in video games we want
02:42:39 everything brown like shit brown like poo um i guess that trend is not quite so strong these
02:42:50 days but for a while it was our friend of the show sigh commented on this video 10 minutes ago
02:42:56 sigh is watching the lion king review by yms are you are you i will have to watch i don't i won't
02:43:04 be able to watch this today i'll probably watch it tomorrow i'm probably i'm gonna i really want to
02:43:09 watch it with um my husband but he's been so busy with the new final fantasy 14 patch i don't know
02:43:15 if i can get him uh two hours two and two hours and 40 minutes i was thinking of like oh movie night
02:43:23 but like that's a long movie in two hours and 40 minutes dude the fucking the fucking kimber review
02:43:30 like a reminder about the kimber video that's a good video i like the kimber video was like
02:43:35 a section of this video yeah it was yeah it would have been insane this this guy just this
02:43:44 videos he just keeps making videos what the fuck is wrong with him the kimber review is
02:43:50 incredible though it is one of the best youtube videos i've seen still yeah it's it's really nice
02:43:56 the i learned a lot from it the the the the how would you describe it like the exhaustive
02:44:03 thoroughness of debunking yeah the like he didn't need to go on for quite as long as he did
02:44:10 but the fact that he did made it absolutely like airtight like you can't argue against it i came
02:44:17 i came away from it feeling like i had a thorough understanding of the subject and that i had learned
02:44:24 some things that i did not know before and i mean what more can you what more can you ask for
02:44:28 like this man single-handedly flipped the entire narrative and it worked yeah and everyone was
02:44:34 like oh yeah we were all wrong about this topic that's true it's kind of amazing it's kind of amazing
02:44:42 that the misconception was so widespread for him to debunk yeah i i i fully believe that like
02:44:51 disney like ripped it off you know i fully believe that until seeing his video oh yeah i just i mean
02:45:00 i don't know it's just what i heard just everyone said oh yeah kimba was a was a a jab a tezuka manga
02:45:08 and they kind of like took took it for the line king i was like yeah okay that tracks because like
02:45:14 you know all their other movies are like adaptations of a thing so why not um
02:45:21 yeah did not know did not know there was so many different versions of kimba did not know there
02:45:27 was so much of it did not know that all the all the comparisons of shots that line yeah ripped off
02:45:34 kimba were actually from kimber properties released after the line king that's funny that's really funny
02:45:41 it's like oh that's how they fucking get you like oh of course it's so they were they're being sneaky
02:45:46 this whole time that it's it's it's funny they tricked me through that whole thing you've you
02:45:51 figure out why the con the misconceptions exist and then there's like like it's really down to just
02:45:58 a few people's blogs there's some there's some paint in the picture there's some in that specific
02:46:03 way to make it look like that and everyone just picked it up and ran with that there's some people
02:46:08 that really should have known better that like should have done the research and maybe they did
02:46:14 and and yet and yet they they told the this this twisted version of the story they they literally
02:46:23 did like the soy jack we very female moves weak and very female like the they did the thing where
02:46:31 they look at a thing like lion america and then lion japan and they're like oh line from japan
02:46:40 that's way better yeah yeah well well kimba's kimba is better because he's from a long line of
02:46:49 great leaders because he's white and he's gotta he wants to be like his ancestors as well as look
02:46:55 like them oh yeah that was a that was a recent pcp you just quoted all that shit at the start it was
02:47:02 funny oh that sounds right i love i love that i love that it's funny yeah just oh god that the
02:47:10 fucking racism too you have no rights you have no right to bully him just because he was white
02:47:18 i just can't believe that when they bring up like the african tribes and they the the the
02:47:23 void the dubbers literally just go because like like i remember like south park doing
02:47:36 shit like that and that's obviously like taking that's obviously like trying to take the piss
02:47:42 but this is like unironic this is just them doing it unironically this is this is how african
02:47:48 speak they they yeah sometimes sometimes uh they don't always do it like that one that one with
02:47:59 the the tribesmen with the grenades was not like that but like a lot of a lot of the other ones are
02:48:07 that was a such a bizarre one yeah like kimba sides with the the hunter with the grenades just
02:48:14 throwing grenades at leopards for revenge where are they getting them from blowing the fucking
02:48:20 smithereens yeah it's just uh that's it so it's good good video just stuff just fucking happens
02:48:29 stuff just happens yeah yeah whatever they wanted to do that day
02:48:37 that's um it's it's kind of neat it's kind of neat that they gave them grenades you know they
02:48:42 didn't just go with the old that old chestnut of like a spear it's kind of you did have a spear
02:48:49 okay but he had grenades too and that's and that's something um okay uh i wonder if that was
02:48:58 literally just because it's easy to animate an explosion instead of like a stab oh god like
02:49:04 oh but you just get like a thing like oh like a still image flies across the screen and there's
02:49:09 a flash of like two frames of an explosion easier to do yeah maybe maybe that makes sense uh next
02:49:17 next voicemail is called praising lord of ghosts plus lore question three two one go so i finally
02:49:26 got my physical uh copy of lord of ghosts based and uh i had read act one before but this is my
02:49:33 first time reading act two and i must say this comic is extremely based great amazing so much fun
02:49:41 thank you uh some amazing pieces of art inherent uh so my favorites are the very osamu tezuka-esque
02:49:49 page where flower heads just like chops the entire page in half um i also really like the
02:49:56 haunting montage where it's the two pages of wacky characters haunting yeah like denizens and
02:50:04 i also love the two page spread of the n-word slime that's for the ghost stories my favorite is
02:50:12 probably writing lesson by nico it's very funny and cute my second favorite is probably uh flower
02:50:19 journey by uh the one ben saint hell yeah i feel really bad for that poor uh cow town denizen who
02:50:27 got a cactus shove in his mouth he didn't deserve that oh no he's a he's a really bad guy he just
02:50:32 didn't see anyway i got a lore question real quick so uh it's clear that the denizens of
02:50:38 new big and by the sea aka new york aka real actual london are supposed to all have like
02:50:43 british and english accents but what about the lord of ghosts is he american that's a good question
02:50:54 the lord of ghosts is not from a country necessarily it's the the the world is like
02:51:03 just because um endless war takes place in like a funny version of of boston that is on the shore
02:51:11 of like the grand canyon which is filled with slime nevada or arizona or whatever yeah yeah
02:51:17 so like that necessarily is like oh that's kind of a real place sorry um and then and then like
02:51:23 endless mods in like london like it's the funny version of that but with mud instead so it's also
02:51:30 a real place um i love the origin of endless but i don't i love the art sorry i just i remembered
02:51:37 that the top 10 mods in video games that was good video oh thanks um like the lord of ghosts
02:51:48 the those locations are like built around like real places but the globe that they are in
02:51:56 is not the real world there is no america um there is no like countries of it's not the real world but
02:52:05 stuff um it's different and lord of ghosts is from somewhere else
02:52:12 gotcha it's it's it's very it's hard to like say right now because like it involves things i haven't
02:52:22 quite written yet um and i it doesn't necessarily like line up with the lore as just like decided by
02:52:31 whoever is in charge of endless war not that it's really in anyone's in really in charge of that
02:52:38 but i like to think it's on like a planet that isn't quite earth and it's different
02:52:45 fascinating can't wait i understand it's not from any real world parallel location
02:52:53 yeah yeah i can't wait for my copy to arrive at some point
02:52:58 same it should be in the fucking air it should be flying around whoa there's
02:53:05 you have to wait for mother-in-law to say that a package arrived at their place and then i'll go
02:53:09 pick it up whenever that happens i gotta check my p.o box i think i probably have a bunch of
02:53:15 returned return to sender packages waiting for me in there then every single time mail
02:53:20 comes up you say i gotta check my p.o box it's too far away it takes me like an hour and a half to
02:53:25 get to medford whoa why so far because i i moved my my p.o box is where my old house used to be
02:53:33 so now it's on the other side of the city uh so it's very annoying i'm more like a p.u box
02:53:41 exactly that is exactly what i'm saying um next voicemail is two seconds long three two one go
02:53:54 very good uh but it has a link it has an image to go with it uh oh yes
02:54:02 the king of personal responsibility prevails and it only took him over two years to edit this video
02:54:07 that's what i called based and then vixx says this guy t and then vixx says in response for the
02:54:14 record i edited 99% of this on the spot of retcon right after filming i remember that this is why
02:54:20 i thought this was weird it was taking so long because i remember i thought victor was going to
02:54:28 to edit the the thing and then nate said he was going to right but i remember victor nearly
02:54:33 completing it at radcon really how embarrassing for nate i didn't watch it i didn't watch it at
02:54:40 radcon but i saw it was like okay we finished filming for the day victor was just on his laptop
02:54:45 working on it it's like but yeah and he's i remember like i i could get this done at least uh
02:54:51 you know a few days after but i guess he didn't complete it well i don't really remember what
02:54:59 happened that i wasn't really involved in discussing that i don't remember seeing vik edit it
02:55:06 and i don't remember seeing him edit it i just don't know why and i don't know and i don't know
02:55:13 why it took nate i mean he just he just wasn't doing it for like two years and then recently
02:55:21 i i egged him on to do it and it took him like two months after he started after he said he was
02:55:29 gonna start doing it to finally do it i don't know what he was doing i don't know what what he
02:55:35 actually did with it that took him along i have no idea what does nate do what does nate do i don't
02:55:41 understand does he does he spend all of his time making youtube videos and they're like really big
02:55:46 and expensive and like snazzy i'm gonna say no wow i'm gonna say he used to make videos fast when
02:55:57 it wasn't full time and then it was full time and then they start making videos yeah funny how that
02:56:05 works well he made a um on his side channel he made a uh a little like meme video about wil smith
02:56:13 slapping chris rock oh i didn't i guess i'm not on that yeah it's best i saw that i don't remember
02:56:22 seeing it i think it's on bestie boy uh someone linked it someone linked it it came out like like
02:56:31 maybe a week ago uh it's a little fanfare timely yeah uh and i guess he's like i wonder was it was
02:56:39 it was like it was actually like right after or maybe right before the uh the the grad garling
02:56:46 house diss track video came out i was like were you doing that instead is this what you were working
02:56:52 on yeah it's bestie boy it looks like i haven't seen this okay i'm subscribed i don't know why
02:56:57 didn't show up for me yeah i don't know i don't know i don't i i don't know why it took nate this
02:57:06 long to uh to do that video i just who knows is he streaming all the time i just really just
02:57:13 don't know what he's doing i don't think he streams all the time does he stream like once a week or
02:57:19 something i'm not actually sure um i don't know man uh i believe vik when he says that he edited
02:57:29 99 of it it checks out i don't know what i don't have a like a comparison to be like oh what did
02:57:36 nate do to that footage to make it the final what did that last one percent entail i just don't know
02:57:43 i just don't know maybe maybe leaving the pcp is as well is is the problem because like you know
02:57:50 when you're on the pcp you talk about what you've been up to you talk about what you've been working
02:57:54 i guess yeah he's not is he just not talking about it because he's not doing anything i don't
02:57:58 understand um if he came on if he had to talk about what he did every week maybe he'd feel
02:58:05 more motivation to do things i'm that's not it's not a crazy idea that's not the craziest thing
02:58:12 i've ever heard someone said actually someone left a comment on the last episode that said
02:58:18 i'm i'm gonna paraphrase it but it was something along the lines of like nate left the podcast
02:58:25 and he nate thinks it's been the topicless podcast for years but actually every episode is the like
02:58:35 motivation like career discussion episode and that's actually exactly what nate needed
02:58:41 and it's i think it's kind of similar to what you're saying now like maybe
02:58:48 yeah like less conspiratorial if you're similar at vain yeah well well just the idea that like uh
02:58:55 you know what if you talked about what you were working on might be good i'm i've been animating
02:59:04 nipples this entire time that's what i've been working on because the nsfw version of my animation
02:59:10 is pretty much done it'll be out by the time this episode airs on my patreon if people want to see
02:59:15 if you're talking about yeah on kazanics comes on with titties out oh that's not out already
02:59:22 oh they're still working on it the the version with the the booba being all on full display isn't
02:59:28 quite done i oh because there's a lot of animations that need to be touched up like some of them are
02:59:34 already done one i had to work on which i'll send you guys um because you're cool but there's like
02:59:44 other shots but i'm still working on i've been working on one today it's the shot of her butt
02:59:49 swinging back and forth and you can see her boobs from behind um because we're just that i just
02:59:56 just gotta say just gotta say in general that's an angle i like i really like that yeah from behind
03:00:03 but you can see the boobs around that's just a good angle here's a good angle yeah um there you go
03:00:10 both of it sending you're away oh my god no this is gonna get me in jail oh actually i don't think
03:00:24 that's true woe there gibbentake has requested that discord block any messages uh that could be
03:00:30 explicit the fuck what are you a square i haven't done that i have to add is it a new setting maybe is
03:00:37 it because we're not added as friends i swear we fucking added each other at some point yeah
03:00:42 discord like unfriends me before discord like unfriends me from people sometimes i swear this
03:00:47 happens okay that's weird because like you sent me the thing that's in the chat in our dms that's
03:00:54 also like file yeah okay there we go okay whatever but yes we're working on that at patreon.com
03:01:06 slash living fall but you gotta support the pcp uh they they you guys missed out we didn't charge
03:01:13 from you missed out we didn't charge for march we didn't charge for march you all owe us all if
03:01:18 you're subscribed you owe us more you you are contractually obligated to send us some more to
03:01:24 make up for it you are otherwise we'll call the police exactly we're gonna we're gonna find you
03:01:31 freeloaders freeloaders criminals criminal scum
03:01:40 okay uh next voicemail is called oh it's a youtube link uh here
03:01:48 all right well is this yeah it's a 11 minute video man we're not watching when we don't watch
03:01:54 videos do you ever watch do you ever watch the company man i don't know never heard of this guy
03:01:58 oh i know this guy he makes videos basically he tells the story of a company usually it's
03:02:07 like a restaurant chain or something uh and he'll be like he'll tell how it started usually it'll be
03:02:13 a company that has sort of like fallen out of favor and like you don't see them anymore and he'll tell
03:02:18 like how it started how it got popular and then like why it ended up like you know eventually
03:02:24 failing or or being reduced in scope or whatever so that's kind of interesting actually i was talking
03:02:31 to munchy about it one time just in private and he said that he watched the channel but he got kind
03:02:38 of fed up with it because basically every like restaurant or every like store or whatever has
03:02:45 the same origin story which is like two rich guys got friends with each other and decided we should
03:02:51 make a store and then they did um and it's true uh but uh i don't know anyone twitter and i we're
03:03:02 all gonna make it though we're all gonna we are right all you need is two rich guys um that's
03:03:09 that's that's the beauty of capitalism everyone's gonna be a millionaire everyone's gonna create
03:03:13 a chain like that and it's all you have to do all you have to do is just work hard at
03:03:20 creating a restaurant chain that then you know opens up you know 30 locations nationwide what if
03:03:26 you had like a ramen like restaurant called the old bowl bowl and chain i'd rather have a
03:03:34 rum and coke if you know what i mean wait the bowl and oh i get it the bowl and chain yeah
03:03:42 that's clever i don't know what the gimmick is i i guess it's an idiom it's like it's like it's like
03:03:48 marriage but there's a bowl involved and it's got ramen in it it's it's next to it's next to a
03:03:53 bowling alley and your plate is connected to a bowling ball by a chain if you don't finish your
03:03:58 meal someone's gonna throw that bowling ball and your plate's gonna go out the window ah
03:04:03 yes a bowling themed restaurant where they they bowl you like your drink in a bowling bowl you
03:04:08 have to suck it out of the holes there's a little cork a little cork in there
03:04:15 uh sounds good to me in a bowling bowl uh so i don't know i know this twitter thing is probably
03:04:23 about that stupid uh elon musk isn't gonna buy it for four hundred and twenty dollars or whatever
03:04:28 haha i really i really don't i'm really unsettled by the whole hmm we need to create real free speech
03:04:36 i'm like what is this about is this about you're just gonna unban donald trump you're just you're
03:04:42 gonna allow vaccine misinformation what's your angle what's your angle he's well he's gonna
03:04:48 crack down on the woke mind virus it is a virus if your trans die and he shoots you with a gun
03:04:57 yeah probably that's it probably unfortunately uh maybe actually that he'll he'll he'll unban
03:05:03 donald trump and he will ban like the trans flag emoji and that's the only things that will change
03:05:08 right because it's that's stifling my free speech we need more free speech trans people existing
03:05:13 can't speak i think um i don't know elon musk is an idiot he probably doesn't even know what he's
03:05:20 gonna do i don't think i don't think they're gonna let him buy it uh i mean it would be terrible
03:05:26 it'd be it'd be terrible for the world like a stupid idea i feel like i'm i'm i'm almost positive
03:05:33 that twitter would just break and just like disintegrate if they actually sold it to elon musk
03:05:39 yeah i don't think it would be good for it um uh yeah i think it would probably go south
03:05:47 not necessarily because like enough people hate elon musk that there'd be a boycott of it but just
03:05:51 sort of i don't know if i can only see bad things happening i think he would do stupid things with
03:05:57 it like they all they already do stupid changes to the platform all the time that everyone hates
03:06:02 i think it would only accelerate um i don't know that it has like fawn like i don't know if its
03:06:09 stock price is down or whatever and that's why this guy made a video about it i know that netflix
03:06:14 is cratering really hard and that's pretty funny it's first people aren't chilling anymore they're
03:06:19 all riled up that's that's true no one's chilling i'm never hearing like back in like 2016 and i
03:06:27 don't think it's changed but like twitter operates at a loss that's why i remember i and that's
03:06:32 probably been like that for a very long time it was youtube that was operating i mean youtube too
03:06:38 yeah i heard like twitter was also like in that boat just not as bad
03:06:44 i don't know how and why do they do it like i could be incorrect i mean i'm gonna double check
03:06:50 oh man if elon musk for instance buys twitter and then he decides i'm gonna turn this ship around
03:06:56 i'm gonna change it so we're operating at a profit that's gonna that's gonna ruin it that would be
03:07:02 oh my god imagine imagine what he would do if that was his goal hold on and twitter gold in 2021
03:07:10 twitter's annual net loss amounted to two hundred and twenty one million dollars overall this is a
03:07:15 significant decrease from the previous year that's good losing two hundred million dollars
03:07:22 that's good actually we're we're getting better that's better what the trend is in like as in the
03:07:27 loss was decreased they were losing more but now we're losing less losing less money is good
03:07:33 that means maybe next year you'll lose even even less and good for them honestly
03:07:43 what if he changes the twitter tweet birds into an ego icon no he can't touch the bird
03:07:51 that's all i have left oh my gosh i'm trying to turn off i'm trying to disable this website from
03:07:57 oh my god this is a fucking nightmare this is a fucking nightmare this website that i'm trying
03:08:01 to like look at the twitter graph is like um if you want to look at this page you have we have to
03:08:07 get your consent to look at our cookies you know and of course it just gets worse as it goes so i
03:08:14 i'm not clicking it allow all so i'm going to click cookie consent manager and then
03:08:19 i can't i still haven't disabled them i have to like click on the sub menus um and that doesn't
03:08:26 work i have to click on see more details and then when i do that which is like one out of like five
03:08:33 menus i have to go through i can't even disable them i have to like then click on another drop
03:08:40 down list and i have to oh my god scrolling scrolling i this is like seven pages deep this is
03:08:47 this is cookie wait i still i still can't disable it um this is this is cookie clicker okay so i want
03:08:56 you to compare these two images and i'm putting one in the little scroll bar on the right side
03:09:01 look how much it shrunk just for me clicking on one of the cookie details i have to scroll through
03:09:07 like 10 pages and at the bottom there's no button that says disable this cookie how do i disable it
03:09:15 i'm so confused it just says allow all or that's it that's nothing else oh god
03:09:24 sometimes there's a there's this thing and it's like they do like a tricksy thing they a little
03:09:30 tricky little ooh you think you're clicking on uh no but it's actually no to the yes to the
03:09:37 it's a reverse and we got you we make the button look good to click and now we have all your cookie
03:09:44 data um and i sometimes take the like five minutes it takes to just say no save it's like yeah like
03:09:52 but sometimes it's just like it's just dreadful and it just ruins the web the internet sucks
03:09:59 right now because of the you don't want us tracking you well complete our fucking 10 minute
03:10:04 like a hundred page survey and you have to like play spot the difference to find the little tiny
03:10:09 button that says don't track me please and then you can do it's like because they know no one's
03:10:14 going to do it but oh we got around the legal loophole it's just fuck off man piece of shit
03:10:20 i love piece of shit i hope i love legal loopholes i hope john oliver just fucking leaks all of
03:10:26 congress's data that he paid bought did he do that yeah um john oliver did something based
03:10:36 actually he um he he did a segment like a pretty long segment talking about data and how easily
03:10:42 they can track you and how it doesn't matter how anonymized for data is they they have your location
03:10:47 they have your workplace where you go where your phone is um at all times um what things you look at
03:10:54 and like they only need like a fraction of information to like narrow it down to one person
03:10:58 but they have like 10 times the amount of information that need to narrow it down reliably
03:11:02 like 90 of a time so basically they can find you easy you can't fucking avoid it um and you like
03:11:11 gave like talked about a whole bunch of like notable cases where people had been tracked down
03:11:15 times um a new studio went and bought some data from because you can just buy it for like 20 bucks
03:11:21 you can buy someone's data if you want it like serial like killers or stalkers or rapists or
03:11:27 whatever the fuck can just buy the data of the people they want to victimize and then figure
03:11:31 out where they live and their whole schedule and everything you could just fucking do it you just
03:11:35 chuck money at it it's fucked up um some news crew went to someone's house and we're just like
03:11:40 you're pregnant right and the and the woman was like yeah how do you know and they they just
03:11:47 fucking figured that out because the computer you know based on their browsing habits was able
03:11:52 to compute that shit so that was like the segment and then John all was like okay so you know you
03:11:59 can get a lot of really personal information you can also find out what websites people look at and
03:12:03 like to some extent their internet history and other shit so he basically figured out like
03:12:10 everyone in congress bought all of their data all of it he has dirt on every single one of him and
03:12:16 he's like if you don't want me to release this you better make it illegal for me to release it
03:12:21 because right now there's nothing legally stopping me wow um huh he's like blackmail uh nifty pretty
03:12:30 cool it's kind of neat but it's legal because he's allowed he's allowed to play funny they haven't
03:12:34 made it illegal to do that huh this is like when did that happen um i'll link the segment it's
03:12:43 pretty cool John Oliver little bass today um it's a little bit bass sounds a little bit
03:12:51 bass let's yeah it's 25 minutes but most of the cool shit is like closer to the end i think
03:13:00 like the last five minutes or so is where the funny stuff starts happening
03:13:06 yeah that blocked in the uk blocked in the uk
03:13:11 that's why that yes i remember this last week tonight i've never been able to watch them
03:13:17 only through people reacting to them in different videos all over is british
03:13:21 but he's in america currently trader he's a he's a he's a he's a what would you call it not a
03:13:29 class trader a nat nation trader i guess that's just a regular regular old run of the washes and
03:13:36 blocks i don't know there's probably other people who've looked at it the vosh pitch on all of her
03:13:41 blackmail's congress lol uh all right all right next voicemail uh is called i am scared uh here we go
03:13:54 there it is there we go three two one go so i've been listening to the podcast
03:14:00 seeing you react to my voicemails when suddenly a chill ran down my spine i've heard a voice
03:14:09 just like my own but it wasn't me i never said anything like that did i forget is someone copying
03:14:16 me how am i going insane is there an imposter amada imposter that's clever my own guess like

03:14:53 you're a smart cookie um what if my little pony played among us what would they do
03:15:01 i'm sure there's there's a thing out there about that i guarantee i guarantee there's probably a
03:15:06 pinky rose video where she's like fluttershy plays amalgas and she used my fucking vectors for it
03:15:12 fluttershy would be really scared the whole time but then the twist at the end would be that she
03:15:16 was the imposter she was so fucking sus it's so obvious let's see this fluttershy plays roblox
03:15:23 fluttershy plays minecraft you know that's a million view video right there the fucking mysterious
03:15:31 meadow well is basically among us because they all like like wear a secret disguise that's right

03:15:49 that long since i talked to this person oh well of course it has i've been out of the
03:15:54 fucking my little pony community for years i just was pinky rose she was a voice person i i think
03:16:00 you've mentioned i vaguely recall seeing a youtube channel of a person doing a fluttershy voice
03:16:07 and playing games and then recently they had like a vtuber fluttershy oh boo kill him gotta kill him
03:16:18 they must be punished this person hasn't uploaded in four years apart from like two song covers
03:16:25 they did maybe someone else so maybe it wasn't this person fluttershy there's probably someone else
03:16:29 plays of something all right oh unless we made like a never channel for it oh vanamelon vanamelon
03:16:37 yeah that's that's the one i also have worked with vanamelon in the past who who it's i i wasn't
03:16:46 like a subscriber i just had seen that person before and i was like ha ha that's funny you're
03:16:51 doing a voice of a pony and you're playing let's plays vanamelon was someone who auditioned for our
03:17:01 anthropology thick reading in like 2013 and she did a pretty good job um and after that i mean
03:17:09 she was working a bunch of other things but like we worked with her in 2014 and then after that she
03:17:14 went off and somehow got a million subscribers good for her yeah very nice there what did she do

03:22:44 thinking about it for some reason i'm just a bro it's a really bad song covered by a really
03:22:55 really weird guy it's a story i might tell on the pcp someday it was it involves saberspark and
03:23:03 a bunch of other people actually interesting is this is this a parody of something
03:23:10 it's like a parody i'm just a kid and life is a nightmare is that what it is i think so yeah

03:23:37 good you should do a comic hahaha slime punishment kickstarter coming soon ish um next one is called
03:23:48 the deep symbolism of the egg uh there posting it okay three two one go you see the graveyard in
03:24:01 the procrastinator's podcast symbolizes death and decay the fact that everything comes to an
03:24:07 end eventually just like this podcast the egg in the workaholics podcast is a symbol of rebirth
03:24:14 and a beginning hope i see by inviting twilight sparkle their podcast grew in size this is what
03:24:21 eggs mean subscribe to vaude vidya for more lore well i get it the the opposite of a graveyard is an egg
03:24:32 dude makes it looks like an egg yeah it's i guess what if you stuck a tiny little straw
03:24:41 into an egg wow don't just suck and just suck the yoke out and just drank the yoke out of no
03:24:47 and like you didn't break the membrane you just kind of drained the yoke so all that's left
03:24:52 is just a thin little empty like yoke membrane inside of well if you did that then i would think
03:25:00 you're an insane person and i wouldn't talk to you the yoke tastes good you gotta put your
03:25:05 toast in it not not through a fucking slipper through a straw i need it pure i don't want to
03:25:11 dilute that that yoke with disgusting toast i just want the straight i want the straight dope
03:25:17 i want to have eggs on toast i've never done it i've never done it what do you mean you've
03:25:23 what do you mean you've never had eggs on toast i just never had it i've never really had eggs
03:25:28 growing up i hated eggs when i was a kid and i only started like them like as an adult and even
03:25:33 then only sometimes get a get a frank pan throw an egg at it i eat eggs all day eggs all the time
03:25:41 i eat egg wraps actually i'm all out of tortillas i have no more tortillas i have egg toast bacon
03:25:47 for breakfast every other day very nice eggs make me feel we're not like eggs make me feel a little
03:25:54 sick on their own like i have to like have them yeah they're good squished into a bread sounds
03:26:00 like it would be good maybe we should get some bread so i can make toast i've never had never
03:26:06 had toast before whoa wait really no i was just doing a thing oh okay yeah
03:26:16 what is this spaghetti right i had to you talk of spaghetti on toast is good
03:26:22 you're what you're you're less than human i've heard of people eating spaghetti sandwiches
03:26:33 i've never really done it i know people do it i've never heard of spaghetti on toast
03:26:37 do you mean like like spaghetti with a like a sauce mixed in yeah like like like tin spaghetti
03:26:43 you know um not not like spaghetti spaghetti but spagetti owes a gross they taste like water
03:26:50 came to america heard so much chocolate spaghetti owes were disgusting they're terrible they're not
03:26:55 good no no but like there there is some like good tin spaghetti it's good with like some cheese
03:27:00 mixed in actually and yeah like i've never i've never had canned spaghetti actually i just um
03:27:08 make it cook pasta in a in a pot yeah um wadis was like the good brand in new Zealand at least
03:27:17 i'm pretty sure they make pretty good tin spaghetti you just put it in a bowl uh microwave it mixing
03:27:24 some cheese and um yeah like you have it on toast and it's fucking delicious and it's like in
03:27:30 new zealand like sort of breakfast thing um that's so messed up our places do like things
03:27:36 really are upside down and backwards down there i guess it's not too different from also a thing
03:27:42 i guess it's not too weird like different from like beans on toast in tomato sauce it's just like
03:27:49 the spaghetti is a carbohydrate you're eating it on top of another carbohydrate
03:27:55 that's too many beans on toast i think beans on toast is something that americans think is weird
03:28:00 but i i've had it and i think it's all right i kind of like it yeah it's just like a protein and
03:28:06 tomato flavor with a bread yeah we also make um spaghetti pizzas they're also very common like
03:28:15 it's like a homemade thing you do in new zealand she just put spaghetti on everything
03:28:20 like like tin spaghetti you just make a pizza you make make make some dough put
03:28:24 spaghetti as the base and you can add like other toppings and stuff to it and you just
03:28:28 all right i guess like i guess i get that because it's tomatoes they're both tomato sauce based
03:28:33 like mac and cheese pizza is a thing in america i mean how much of a stretch is it well i've never
03:28:37 had this i have a thought that much it's not that much of a thing i have a thought new zealand
03:28:42 is close to like asia and for some reason sort of asian thing like i've heard of like asian
03:28:53 mcdonald's having spaghetti could it be that that's like a that's like a thing that's what
03:29:00 trixie said about no well they she said it about the philippines there was that philippines restaurant
03:29:06 that had spaghetti right that chain ocean and i think no i think you're right i think maybe i have
03:29:12 seen maybe i've seen pictures of spaghetti at like asian mcdonald's i think you're right so like maybe
03:29:18 that is just that quadrant of the world has spaghetti as a as a topping or like as a more of
03:29:24 a thing you i don't know because they got noodles maybe i don't think new zealand's like close to
03:29:32 asia though new zealand's pretty like just far away from everything i mean it's pretty far away
03:29:37 for everything but like i mean i mean would you describe australia as being close to asia
03:29:42 it's closer but it like oh that's actually even further i mean it's a long way from italy it's
03:29:48 this thing i'm thinking of i think new zealand's one of the most remote one of the more remote
03:29:54 quote unquote western countries because if i try and think of like how many like italian like
03:30:01 like authentic italian restaurants there are in new zealand there's probably not that many because
03:30:05 like it's a long trip italian food is not common in new zealand um and when you find it it's not
03:30:12 great i i usually think of new zealand as being basically like right off the coast of australia
03:30:17 but no it's actually like really far yeah yeah it's like the entire like length of mexico away
03:30:26 it's like it's like flying to australia is like three and a half hours by plane
03:30:31 oh wow that's a decent distance yeah that's like that's what i know it's like traveling to
03:30:38 fucking uh grease from where i am maybe a bit further i lived near the top of the north island
03:30:47 and i've lived near the bottom of the south island i've lived all over new zealand i miss a lot of
03:30:53 things about it like a hundred percent completed new zealand would you say not entirely i haven't
03:30:59 been to stewart island stewart island is like the furred island that's like small off the bottom
03:31:03 it's like really small there's like a town there but i haven't been that far down oh i can see the
03:31:09 tiny tiny tiny little island like way down below on the map i can't i can't even
03:31:16 wait is it the Auckland's oh i was looking at the i was looking at the Auckland's that's different
03:31:25 i mean there's a lot of islands in Auckland but that they're at the top of the Auckland islands yeah
03:31:31 okay yeah this this is fucking stewart island and in the in the bottom left corner it like
03:31:38 shows you like where it is it's a little box yeah i was i was looking at the wrong thing but i see it
03:31:43 now yeah it's like it's a lot of islands too massachusetts has marthas vineyard which is like
03:31:51 our own little stewart island well mason bay is such a curve it's so circular how did they do that
03:31:58 probably the fancy probably like the waves would erode the ground and in a circle fashion
03:32:07 but why why only there everywhere else's jagged well ocean currents they go in funny lines
03:32:15 they go in swirls and swelps and splashes on the grand on the grand line mysterious ocean currents
03:32:23 exists that will take you like send you to the next island like like it would be like the rock
03:32:30 there was very soft very easy to erode and so it's like a very like smooth beach probably over
03:32:37 there and then the other places are like hard rocks so they're like crumbly
03:32:43 damn geography or geometry now i know geology probably
03:32:50 geologist geography geometry all of these things and more on the pro
03:32:58 procrastinator's podcast uh next next voicemail is uh was my samurai fan art wrong all along
03:33:10 three two one go in that video where oblivion fall reacts to interrupting death pig he said
03:33:17 then they fuckers have canon designs but where why did i never saw these where are they um
03:33:28 the canon designs have been shown on the pcp um the only i remember drinking by the way this is
03:33:36 from drinking moth i remember i'm drinking moth oh yeah i remember drinking moth drawings i
03:33:43 considered those to be the closest thing to canon i love drinking moth drawings i mean like
03:33:48 for for some of the nade fuckers like didn't have can designs i'm i'm mainly talking
03:33:53 clusterpunk kitchen wait wait no i'm i'm stupid i'm stupid that was not from drinking moth this is
03:33:58 the wrong one this voicemail was called where are canon designs of nade fuckers i will grab
03:34:04 the canon designs if i can remember what fucking folder it is and i'm pretty sure i know where to
03:34:10 find it uh when i was editing episode 295 i'm pretty sure i grabbed them all in the show notes so
03:34:21 this is uh i'll post clusterpunk kitchen uh that's his canon design okay
03:34:29 um vem snakes change your life yeah that's that canon design and uh tapekeeper you know
03:34:39 so so ben yeah the vem sexes design kind of came from you two oh yeah i i drew this
03:34:47 yeah because gib gib was so i think you designed it that specific image was four eyes maybe
03:34:53 or no maybe it wasn't actually our number i think i drew this i think four eyes might have
03:34:58 drawn something that i based this on i feel yeah i think you drew something for the episode where
03:35:07 vem snakes appeared and then four eyes drew fan art and this is the fan art maybe but yeah so like
03:35:13 vem snakes was originally i think i yeah vem snakes was originally green maybe it is vem
03:35:20 snakes which like when when vem snakes first appeared on the podcast i remember like devoo
03:35:24 was even there um when you're like we showed the patreon.com slash vm snakes which does exist it
03:35:30 had a picture of a green snake and then gib was like oh i like to think of it as like the you know
03:35:36 pump uh not only run away from snakes but were the red and black and i liked that idea so i took
03:35:41 i took that oh that's why did i say that back then yeah you suggested it um yeah you did and then
03:35:50 ben drew the snakes like weren't like in a shirt in a beanie looking like ben and that was great
03:35:56 and i'm like yeah this is just yeah this is canon now yeah so i remember canon designs
03:36:02 i had forgotten but yeah i remember that the tapekeeper is this guy from lesbian horse rpg
03:36:11 and i don't that's not his obviously that's not his canon his name in that game
03:36:17 javis javis javis yeah yeah yeah uh there he is the man himself
03:36:26 i mean if i want to be a little shit i could like like keep the same design and like maybe
03:36:32 change the color scheme but i am too lazy it looks fine yeah fuck it it's all good give the shit
03:36:38 yes those are the those are the canon those are the canon designs for vows free as for
03:36:43 large nose man fouls and lung man i never made canon designs as far as i'm concerned
03:36:48 all the fan art i've seen is equally valid i've seen a few different interpretations and they're
03:36:52 all fun so okay so the next one is actually was my samurai fan art wait what is this that's the
03:37:00 first ever appearance of them first that's the first ever appearance of them snakes

03:37:42 the next voicemail is was my samurai fan art wrong all along from drinking moth so let's give
03:37:48 that a listen uh three two one go hi drinking moth here so i guess i got confused wasn't samurai
03:37:56 samurai incarnated as mage's baby girl and mage lives in lythuania that was the idea behind the
03:38:02 image that's good that's good that's good no it's ma- maize baby uh ma- ma- ma- ma- ma- ma- ma-
03:38:17 and ethan ralf's baby uh uh rosanne or whatever rosanna ralf yeah may aka pantsu party aka used

03:38:50 mage is different but uh that art you drew is extremely fucking cute and good and great
03:38:57 from last episode but i get it but now i understand why she's lythuanian and that's
03:39:03 extremely funny uh i guess there's two i guess there's two
03:39:16 you can't it's it's canon everything's canon um shoot me with it please
03:39:22 next uh voicemail is called um did i did i post it uh ben versus vtuber three two one go
03:39:35 you know ben you're free to express your opinions and shit you don't have to explain yourself to
03:39:40 anyone either but when you go out of your way to target people with your ire and then not explain
03:39:45 yourself you come off like a real inconsiderate asshole then you go on to badmouth people for
03:39:50 being unthoughtful like what's his face patent manning or whatever patent manning what kind of
03:39:55 hypocrisy is that who the fuck are you to tell people what they should and shouldn't be liking or
03:40:00 doing and you find to hate it but when you bring that to their attention unprovoked uh you're just
03:40:06 starting a fight you're making the world a worse place shut up shut up pussy fight me i mean i do
03:40:14 kind of agree with it though in just the sense that it's like it's totally meaningless that it
03:40:20 like is has become a thing and it's entirely because you decided to like poke the bear i guess
03:40:28 like that there was that one the one twitter thing if someone makes a bad post that you don't
03:40:34 like the reasonable reaction is to reply and say i don't like this now that part is fine but like
03:40:40 it's the it's the like acting them with the episode where we talk about it like well that was
03:40:46 because she screen she did the screenshot pity thing so i feel like she opened i feel like she
03:40:52 was the aggressor i mean i guess i i made the i made the replies for look who cares whatever
03:41:03 this is the biggest fucking non issue that's ever happened i i don't like this post and then
03:41:08 they're like like i i agree ben comes across as a fucking villain all the time it's what it's
03:41:14 what he does it's what you're good at but like all all this shit is so inconsequential at the end
03:41:20 of the day because it's like cool i don't like i don't like a post by vtuber and then the vtuber
03:41:24 in character is like what are you doing and it's like i don't i don't have to answer to you like
03:41:29 imagine saying that i'm making that i made the world a worse place that part isn't like whatever
03:41:35 but yeah like like i can understand thinking it's a bad look or whatever but like sure whatever
03:41:42 bends no stranger to that like that's not new like who cares just like like like do you do you
03:41:48 think that i didn't know that like by telling this ooh i am a little baby on twitter like
03:41:55 fuck yourself do you think i didn't know that i kind of look like the asshole sure of course
03:42:01 yes it's fine though actually it's good sometimes whatever i don't i don't trust any vtuber who like
03:42:10 like plays off the ooh i'm a baby fang it's it's it's it's a little little suss little i just don't
03:42:17 i don't like the tone of it i don't like seeing it uh you know she can do what she wants i can't
03:42:23 stop her and i wouldn't i wouldn't stop her if i could like whatever i just but i don't have but
03:42:28 i don't have to like it sure sure i just feel and you know i would not have like tried to like
03:42:35 instigate anything further because it's not important yeah well and and indeed and indeed it
03:42:45 it's uh i don't know you know i just she like because she was making posts about it like she
03:42:53 was using it for attention so like what's so like why not why not make a post about it
03:43:00 and add her with it like she doesn't mind she she likes it she it was good for her like she's
03:43:05 welcome i literally did her a favor and idiots like this are like oh ben you're such a demon
03:43:12 ben how could you that's a child ben that's a child you're attacking you bully put yourself
03:43:17 in her shoes for a second if someone if i made a post and so i'm quote retweeted she she unblocked
03:43:22 me she's she unblocked me after a while she screenshotted that she had blocked me and then
03:43:28 she unblocked me and then i added her again and she screenshotted me and said i'm blocking him again
03:43:34 he's like why would you why would you unblock me it's because you fucking want it you dumb idiot
03:43:40 it's because you like to play the victim you're welcome imagine for a second and i i can imagine
03:43:45 that's easily because i am a content creator imagine i post a thing post a little meme for
03:43:50 my followers and some person gets mad like screen quote retweets and be like oh this is dumb am i
03:43:55 going to like what what is the appropriate action from there i would probably just fucking ignore
03:44:01 it and move on but they decided to screenshot it and make a thing out of it and knowing that it
03:44:07 would probably get more responses from you but it's like it's like the transaction they signed up for
03:44:12 like i'm gonna yeah more attention to this and that person's probably gonna also bring more
03:44:15 yeah they they chose to bring more attention to it they made a decision that is what they want it's
03:44:20 clearly what they i think i think people that say stuff like this just don't understand like they
03:44:25 don't understand that this is that this is a content creator who is doing this to like manage
03:44:31 their fucking public profile right and i and if you maybe if you don't get that maybe you think i
03:44:38 you think i'm just bullying a baby and then okay whatever like many it's it's it's almost manufactured
03:44:45 drama that is it's like it feels like a transaction of like all right i'm gonna we're gonna we're gonna
03:44:51 have this little beef and get some attention for ourselves that's how it seems to me and like
03:44:56 right or whatever like i know i know with you you're just fucking having fun you always seem
03:44:59 like you're having fun when you do this shit so sometimes the you're you're always crowing like
03:45:07 ooh we talked about this on this pcp whoo-hoo and i'm like oh no yeah funny ben's at it again
03:45:14 being i i i i did that to be like i did that just to see what what kind of reaction it would get
03:45:20 and it and it got it it got the same one again like uh ben is the mean this ben saint character
03:45:26 i try i tried to be reasonable but you're just too evil just too evil and vicious
03:45:35 it is amusing think about the the because like it really does seem like some people
03:45:42 aren't aware it's like it's not it's not actually a little baby you know they're they're not they're
03:45:48 not they're not responding as if this is like two adults like making decisions about how to handle
03:45:55 an interaction this is they're responding as though i kicked over a little kid saying castle
03:46:00 and he's crying and i'm laughing at him yeah like i i wouldn't do that i don't like conflict on

03:50:50 yes yes where they're like shadrack me shack at a bendigo a benny boo a benny band like half of
03:50:57 those it's like a fucking joke and a bendigo yeah or or i'm probably not saying it correctly but
03:51:04 and veggie tells you it's like a part was like i'm benny a benny boo a bunny benny benny and
03:51:08 like it's like a fucking joke and i swear this voicemail use like half of those yeah i i i i don't
03:51:16 know if i ever i know the one yeah i know the one you talked about i don't know if i ever saw
03:51:20 that episode but shadrack and a bendigo huh yeah is it a bendigo when i hear ben yes i swear
03:51:26 bendigo i think of oh more than going to bendigo to get me cube yeah yeah shadrack and a bendigo
03:51:34 sounds right to my ear some some people did something one time oh it is a crazy it's a bed
03:51:42 nago oh a bed nigo a bed nago oh you can't say that yeah i mean there's no r
03:51:53 a bed nigo shad shadrack shadrack mashach and abed a bed nigo abed nigo figures from the
03:52:04 biblical book daniel they throw yeah they're thrown at the furnace and then the angel protects them
03:52:09 got it got it because you need a big furnace to make chocolate i do i i need a bigger i need a
03:52:16 bigger kitchen i need a bigger kitchen to make my worms and now i can i can make these tiny
03:52:21 little micro batches and like that's fine but what a waste of time i'll never forgive veggie
03:52:26 tails for like changing that episode because there's the bunny song where they're singing about who
03:52:33 i'm a i'm a villain i'm not gonna go to church i'm not gonna go to school i just want to eat
03:52:38 fucking bunnies all day what the fuck yeah and they were like um um you're not going to church um
03:52:44 you better change those lyrics and then it's like okay i i won't eat tofu it's a new lyric it sucks
03:52:53 wait like in the episode they tell him to change the song no no no no like the episode got re-released
03:53:00 with the lyrics change because parents complained instead of i won't go to school it's i won't eat
03:53:05 tofu yeah it's it's it sucks but he's a villain he's a villain and now it's now it's now it's about
03:53:14 eating healthy instead of like like the original the original like theme was like cancel culture gone
03:53:21 too far it's so it's just a weaker theme because the original theme is like being like too obsessed
03:53:27 with material things where it distracts you from jesus and now it's about i just eat healthy like
03:53:32 that's a that's a weaker message for what i think they would want i don't know
03:53:38 yeah uh i didn't i did not know that but that's odd that's really weird like why would they have a
03:53:46 problem with why would it be a problem that the villain says he's not going to go to church
03:53:52 i don't understand i don't know villains can understand the motivation because then it's
03:53:57 encouraging us to be bad you see but but he gets punished i think in the end maybe somehow
03:54:04 or he has to change her heart or something you see at the end there's like oh it changed my
03:54:07 ways because it was bad okay okay okay next voicemail uh there's two with the same name
03:54:17 for some reason the next one is called ethan ralph lore might be a little loud three two one

03:56:53 voicemails in the future i don't know the episode of quicker next one no next one is called bendy
03:57:02 you play yugioh answer no i don't even think there's a voicemail with this one uh wait no
03:57:10 okay that's not the right this one is called forklift man the one we just posted okay three
03:57:15 two one go oh i'm currently a man in a forklift so at 50 feet in the air i'm going to use the
03:57:21 clairvoyance to this position gives me to talk down to you specifically ben seni i do not understand
03:57:26 the position you have uh not being somebody earthy uh explaining your position and assuming them
03:57:33 to just clairvoyantly assume your position and what is directly on our own uh about their their
03:57:41 shit uh you just just explain yourself like you did in the podcast to make no more sense i already
03:57:48 agreed to see but i grew through more and better after i listened to you explain the fucking vtuber
03:57:54 thing uh please on twitter.com slash it's also ugly or abitual no whatever the fuck explain
03:58:02 yourself instead of just like posting funny ha ha dunks uh i just i twitter points uh i don't
03:58:08 want to talk to that person i don't want i don't care if they understand i don't want to talk to
03:58:14 them there's also like you can't convey tone in a tweet it's going to be misread like trying to
03:58:21 explain yourself on twitter is the biggest mistake you can ever make when yeah like if you generally
03:58:27 want people to understand you that's not how you get people to understand you they're going to twist
03:58:30 something you've said i yeah i i agree it sounds just the thought of trying to like explain what i
03:58:38 mean in a tweet thread on twitter just makes me like sick like i i i i i just i'm not willing to do
03:58:46 it it's it's a nightmare i mean i agree with that that's why i wouldn't like say anything
03:58:53 i wouldn't just i just i wouldn't make the point if i wasn't ready to explain it i'm willing to
03:58:59 make the point i'm just not willing to explain it and i guess the fault and i guess the consequences
03:59:05 people like this yeah i once was asked for voice acting hot takes someone said post your
03:59:11 voice acting hot takes and i'm like well i think the quality of dubbing of any kind regardless
03:59:17 of whether it's anime or not just tends to be worse quality performance compared to the original
03:59:24 and there's also like you know i just prefer to watch things in their original form because
03:59:30 it's going to be closer to the original vision of the people making it and that's just better
03:59:33 especially cross-cultural cultural where certain things get localized and it just
03:59:39 takes away from the original intent and at the same time and it goes both ways because people who
03:59:45 you know i all i think it's cringe when people watch my little pony in japanese because they
03:59:50 want it to be like an anime like that's also cringe like watch english things in english
03:59:54 watch japanese things in japanese i made that tweet i got yeah screenshot it by a fucking person
04:00:01 who i won't name but she has she had like a decent following calling me ableist saying that
04:00:06 i was attacking dyslexic people who can't read subtitles when i never mentioned anything about
04:00:12 subtitles at all i just talked about the quality of the voice acting and she like this this horrible
04:00:16 person like like is is ableist and all this shit and she made this huge friend and a bunch of her
04:00:20 followers came after me and i'm like i never said yeah even in the screenshot i didn't say anything
04:00:26 like that i don't even see the connection so like that can happen and that and that was when
04:00:30 i kind of realized i'm just never gonna post an opinion on twitter ever again no matter how innocuous
04:00:35 it's just not worth it because i had to spend like two whole days that's fair dealing with that
04:00:40 shit and somehow a bunch of my friends got convinced by it i had to like explain to them
04:00:45 that's not what i said please actually read my tweets and then they will eventually like
04:00:49 after fighting with them over huge friends they were eventually like oh i see i guess you never
04:00:55 said that yeah it's so weird that like oops it's like what sort of people would hear on the grape
04:01:06 find that oh oblivion fall is ableist now and just immediately agree with that and just assume it's
04:01:12 true oh damn instead of like checking i hate that like that's my my my hate that for oblivion fall
04:01:20 my husband fucking hates dubbing of all kinds he's dyslexic too he can fucking read it
04:01:28 fine yeah like i don't know yeah like even if that was something i said i don't even think it's
04:01:33 accurate i think this was the is the i've been told dyslexia is mostly an issue with like paragraphs
04:01:38 more than single lines is it is the idea that because you said you prefer uh dub subs to dubs
04:01:48 that yeah i prefer so well well well dyslexic people need need dubs so you are attacking us
04:01:56 yeah it's like and i i immediately my response was you can do you do you i'm just saying what i
04:02:01 prefer um and what i think sounds better but like it's up to you what you do and like they
04:02:05 are like oh so you're saying people can't watch from me saying we should stop and we're saying we
04:02:08 should boycott him it's like yeah i did i didn't say that and when i tell them i didn't say that
04:02:15 oh so now you're backpedaling it's like i never said it in the fucking first place like yeah this
04:02:20 isn't backpedaling what the fuck that was so horrible i was i was um okay i mentioned i mentioned
04:02:29 last week some some people some people that were my friends that decided they didn't like me and then
04:02:36 decided to go and spread lies not even about me so much about other people i guess out of spite
04:02:41 or in retaliation or something and i was talking to some people about the some people had heard
04:02:47 some of that stuff and i was talking to them trying to explain what that was all about and it was
04:02:52 really frustrating to hear to see a lot some people's response was i'm i'm trying to convince them
04:03:00 these these things that they said so and so did are are simply fabricated it's not it's not true
04:03:07 like it's just made up and and some people's response was to be like well okay but like
04:03:14 it's not like they technically said it was a crime or anything like they just like they're just saying
04:03:19 that they did they're just saying they think it's fucked up that they did it not that it's like a
04:03:23 crime or anything and i'm like you you dense fuck the point is it's not true in the first place
04:03:28 it doesn't matter whether like what like what the like what the what these are details that are missing
04:03:36 the entire point right yeah these are these are these are things have i said too much have i gone
04:03:41 to have i explained too much about the situation oh you're fine i hope i hope not okay i don't want
04:03:47 to get into details about it but it's like these are these are it's and suddenly it's like well now
04:03:53 you know i i don't i they're trying to make me split hairs trying to make me split hairs on a
04:03:59 subject that is not even not even really germane to the point because it's like well they've
04:04:04 we've already assumed that this thing we heard is true because we heard it and now the onus is on
04:04:09 you to well well you know if you're gonna make these extraordinary claims that that thing we heard
04:04:14 wasn't true you know you've got to supply evidence of that but like we just believed the initial
04:04:20 claim with no evidence at all just because i know just because someone said it just because
04:04:24 someone said i wonder why that is is it just sort of like a general predisposition to like
04:04:30 believe bad news i think so i think i think it's just i hear that somebody is like a bad person
04:04:37 now and then yeah the evidence comes out that it was a lie and it's still hard for them to like
04:04:43 like accept that because they were so ready to it just to believe that the bad news was real
04:04:51 i think it's it's just a cognitive thing like when you hear something and and you
04:04:56 you know it doesn't conflict with any previous information you have you're inclined to just
04:04:59 be like oh okay i've learned something i guess but then when you hear some new information that
04:05:04 does conflict with the old information you're like huh well that's that's a conflict there's
04:05:10 some there's some conflicting information here well we gotta i can't just i can't just believe this
04:05:18 because i had thought something else i don't know it's just what the jargon was called out for
04:05:23 basically with like the vaccine like someone's like oh did you hear that the vaccine has this
04:05:26 crazy side effect makes your eyeballs fall out and he's like whoa that's crazy and then if you
04:05:31 that's not the case he's like um i'm gonna need some evidence that that doesn't happen yeah yeah
04:05:35 but somebody but somebody else told me but some yeah it is yeah but somebody else told me that it is
04:05:40 and like yeah didn't didn't require any evidence for the initial claim but if you try to dispute it
04:05:45 it's like well prove it prove it motherfucker yeah it should never believe anything like honestly
04:05:53 true i'm sure it comes i'm sure the evolutionary reason is caution is generally good in a lot of
04:06:03 situations better better safe than sorry like works oh there might be a tiger i i heard something in
04:06:10 that in that cave there might be something in there a tiger or a fucking bear or some
04:06:15 shit um uh better to be cautious than to just be like oh well you know like maybe maybe some
04:06:21 person person goes into caves says hey there's no tiger it's like um well i don't know i heard
04:06:27 noise i'm uneasy you can't prove that there's no tiger because the tiger could just be hiding
04:06:33 but i think it's a combination of those things people are more cautious they want to agree they
04:06:40 want to believe the bad news because if it if it turns out that they're correct that the bad news
04:06:46 is true um then they can save themselves from it or whatever they can they can survive longer
04:06:54 from the tiger in the cave what if a tiger what what was that cave like that parable of the people
04:07:01 in the cave with the shadows on the wall plateaus yeah plateaus came what if a tiger just came in
04:07:07 there and they killed them off i then i guess they'd be 10 they'd see the shadow of the tiger on
04:07:15 the wall as it was coming towards them and they'd be like oh whoa a tiger and then but unlike all
04:07:21 the previous tigers they'd seen this one eats them yeah damn that's a really makes you think
04:07:28 that's a real heads maybe a little
04:07:34 the next voicemail is an image
04:07:41 yeah i i don't know what this dog is but i can infer
04:07:46 is it like is it is it like um the inspiration for that future rama dog
04:07:52 sort of sort of that waits for his master forever yes there was a japanese dog who
04:08:00 he would follow his master to the train every day and then he would wait for him at the train at the
04:08:06 end of the day and meet him there and one day the master died at work and uh the dog just kept
04:08:13 coming to the train every day for the rest of his life oh no watch yeah shcw videos he's you're

04:15:06 uh it's not related to that other riley riley tweets is some guy i don't know i think he's
04:15:16 got a podcast i think one of the other people on that podcast asked me to be on one time and i
04:15:22 said yes sure i would and then i got really mad because i one of the right riley or that other
04:15:29 person was like simping for trixie in some comments and i was like fuck you i won't be on your stupid
04:15:34 podcast so these people are trixie heads as far as i'm concerned so they're they're they're dogs
04:15:42 so i'm not unblocking immediately unburying the hatchet yeah no he can bury his hatchet if he
04:15:49 wants mine is saying out and ready ready for action next one is called vtuber more like ppooper
04:15:58 three two one go i think i understand what ben was saying last week about small vtuber
04:16:02 communities so it's kind of hard to articulate so let me know if i'm not quite right here it
04:16:06 reminds me of the phenomenon of shout-out channels on youtube that just turn out video
04:16:10 spotlighting random let's players who don't have a following of course if you look at the
04:16:13 comments of those videos they're just filled with people begging for shout-outs nobody there was
04:16:17 actually in the market to find new let's players to watch it's just a promotional theater where the
04:16:21 only one getting anything out of it is the channel owner exploiting gullible people yeah i think the
04:16:25 thing that makes this feel so despicable is that said gullible people don't understand that they
04:16:29 don't know the first thing about developing a social media presence so instead they shamelessly
04:16:34 latch onto this idea that the only thing between them and the youtube career of their dreams is
04:16:38 just the right shout-out it's a pathetic waste of time from people who want success but refuse to
04:16:42 reckon with the fact that it's just out of their reach here and this sort of thing is all over the
04:16:46 place in every form of content creation when it comes to small vtubers it's perfectly fine if
04:16:51 you actually do just have a tiny community of people you enjoy but i've gotten the sense myself
04:16:55 that most of them are just there to use each other despite the fact that it's a zero-sum game
04:16:58 where there's no growth potential but since they never admit to any of that themselves they just
04:17:03 pretend that everything is going great and all they need to do is support each other they made a
04:17:07 comparison to the crypto we're all going to make it mentality and i feel like that's extremely apt
04:17:11 it's simply crafting a mass delusion for each other but i could be wrong i don't really follow
04:17:16 vtubers what do i know that is a much i think you said it better than i did but i agree with
04:17:23 everything see ben if you just said if you typed that out in a tweet it would have been so much
04:17:28 better yeah it's just that easy yeah i mean i i can definitely save like shout-outs absolutely
04:17:37 can make a career for you if you're already doing like good high quality shit well of course you know
04:17:46 like yeah when i mean something when it's when it's yeah when it's to an audience of people
04:17:52 who are not looking for shout-outs themselves it means something if it's just a regular audience
04:17:59 of normal people wanting to see things yeah yeah like the audience has to be people who are interested
04:18:05 in the in the in what you actually have so like when i get a retweet from krakow unlike a work in
04:18:10 progress my patreon would jump up $50 that day like that that would happen um just a retweet
04:18:16 from one guy um you know big twitter artist retweeting small artists you know just just like
04:18:22 cheesy said like it can have an effect but it's because he predicted everything but it's because
04:18:27 the stuff i'm making is pretty good i think um if i was just like not making anything that interesting
04:18:33 i probably wouldn't get a boost like that so like it could definitely help but like yeah like these
04:18:39 communities it's like everyone's just fair for a shout-out yeah like the people the the the
04:18:45 number of like people who are actually like consuming their stuff is like small unless the
04:18:49 shout-out comes from like one of the big hollow life people it's not really going to do much
04:18:53 of anything yeah it reminds me of like um it reminds me of like uh a big big joel made a video
04:19:02 about small youtube reddit where like there was that one guy or something like that where there was
04:19:09 a guy who was just making i don't know there was a there was a specifically it was about one guy a
04:19:16 case study in like but it was talking about like on reddit there'd be like subreddits of people
04:19:23 that are just there to like ask like how do i grow my channel like how do i grow my channel
04:19:27 like just talking to each other just guys talking to each other about like how they're going to
04:19:32 grow their channel like i'm caring guy who doesn't have a large channel responds yes yes exactly it's
04:19:38 like oh no you got to do this you got to be doing that you got to be doing such and such and so and
04:19:42 so i like i read about it or like another guy i know did that and it worked or something
04:19:48 and it's and and it's like you know uh like like nobody goes or or on like the the
04:19:57 topastic forums like i feel like people comic creators would be there like posting about their
04:20:03 comics like hoping that people would find them and read them but the only other people on those
04:20:08 forums were other comic creators that were there to they were there to either discuss making comics
04:20:14 or to shill their own stuff so nobody was there to find yeah stuff to read i think it's a skill in
04:20:22 itself to like to know where to advertise it's like i i remember this this um there was this uh
04:20:31 reddit that i would occasionally put my hypocrite game reviews on is a game reviewer uh subreddit
04:20:39 where game reviewers would put their game reviews and there was no upvotes there was no nothing
04:20:46 no discussion nobody cared but it was just like yeah like oh yeah i guess i got to post
04:20:52 things but like this doesn't i there's no there's no one here no one is going to see this and like
04:20:58 find me so i stopped doing it it's just there's there's too many places like that too many people
04:21:05 trying to make art more people need to stop trying and just watch my content instead
04:21:16 yeah it's i think this this guy said it pretty well yeah like this voicemail better than colabbing
04:21:23 is sorry better than shout outs is collabing the problem is like not everyone's down for that
04:21:29 um yeah like some some good advice i've heard is like and again these things the stuff only
04:21:34 works if you're good at what you do because if you suck no one's going to come over yeah just be
04:21:38 really good like yeah i mean it's as simple as that no that's not the only thing but like if if if
04:21:44 you think that you're good and promise a lot of people who are bad think they are good but
04:21:50 getting getting around that hurdle like find people of a similar size to you to collab with
04:21:55 and then both of you might get a little bit bigger in fact the smaller you are the more
04:21:58 effective it is because the less chance your audience overlaps um and then that'll make you a
04:22:03 little bigger and then find someone else who's closer to your new size a little bigger and you
04:22:06 can sort of like hop back and forth up the ladder and eventually go big like that's a strategy i've
04:22:12 heard of that can work but you have to like be able to bring something to the table because just
04:22:19 messaging a guy being like hey we have similar subscriber counts want to collab it's like she's
04:22:26 not necessarily gonna work like um like what like what do you mean like what do you want
04:22:32 exactly well i want to steal something that you have in exchange for nearly nothing well if you
04:22:37 have similar subscriber counts when you'd both mutually benefit is the idea but like you have
04:22:42 to like also be somewhat good at what you do or have someone to bring to the table that they would
04:22:47 actually care about um never like message to collab someone and not without like having an idea
04:22:53 already as well like you always have to like absolutely it's like let's collab it's like okay
04:22:58 on what it's like oh i shit i didn't think about that oh i don't know i thought you'd tell me
04:23:05 vocaru yeah next one is is a vocaru link uh let's get it let's get it uh three two one go

04:32:25 Oh yeah, yeah, it might be.
04:32:27 I think this is that same person.
04:32:29 Give him an inch and they'll take my splinch.
04:32:31 It's true.
04:32:33 That is what you say.
04:32:34 That I said it, now it's gotta be like a catchphrase.
04:32:40 There's no shut your fuck Gib is what I'm saying.
04:32:45 Oh, I want to read it.
04:32:47 No, send it again, please.
04:32:50 Try again next week, I hope.
04:32:54 I hope to read.
04:32:55 Also, who are you?
04:32:56 Do you do art elsewhere?
04:32:57 I would like to follow you.
04:32:58 Also, who are you?
04:32:59 Well, at the very top, it says by new.
04:33:02 By new.
04:33:03 Well, I'm sure that'll be easy to track down.
04:33:06 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's very helpful.
04:33:09 New artist.
04:33:10 Yeah, that's not gonna get me anywhere.
04:33:15 Next one is an image, this is the last one.
04:33:22 It's giraffe rig.
04:33:25 Psychic and normal, friendly looking, quirky, funny, cute,
04:33:28 the only fucking giraffe Pokemon, the gayest IRL animal.
04:33:33 You can search it.
04:33:34 Oh, horse Pokemon equals cool moves, stump, ground, fight
04:33:38 type abilities, horse cock, horse cock.
04:33:42 Looks like it's wearing pants.
04:33:44 One piece taught us that a giraffe is a type of cow,
04:33:47 not a type of horse.
04:33:48 So get that checks out with the little weird bubbles
04:33:52 on its head.
04:33:53 Ethically diverse coloring because it has white and brown
04:33:56 because it's a white and black.
04:33:58 Yeah, and yellow like those guys and it's like those guys
04:34:01 in Star Trek with the white and black face,
04:34:06 easily fan artable, easily anthropomorphizable.
04:34:09 No, there's that one old episode from the original series
04:34:12 where the guys whose faces are literally splitting black
04:34:16 and white like half down their face.
04:34:17 Like that Zetsu from Naruto.
04:34:21 Probably.
04:34:22 He's like a plant man and he's black and white and a plant.
04:34:26 Freakish chimera creature with two heads,
04:34:28 360 lookout view, never lonely,
04:34:30 self-masterbutory capabilities.
04:34:32 Guess what, buddy?
04:34:33 I too have self-masterbutory capabilities
04:34:36 and I can tell you they're a huge evolutionary advantage.
04:34:40 So I agree.
04:34:43 This one has no evolution,
04:34:44 even weird or doesn't lose its identity.
04:34:46 Yeah, I can see the appeal of giraffe rig.
04:34:50 I've never really looked too hard at it
04:34:52 because it's like, ah, it's just sort of an animal
04:34:54 but it does have a very odd tail.
04:34:57 Psychic normal is a good type combo.
04:35:02 I think normal nullifies both of psychics,
04:35:05 or two out of psychics, three weaknesses.
04:35:07 Psychic nullifies normal's only weakness.
04:35:10 Like that's pretty good.
04:35:12 You can't, it's undeniable.
04:35:15 Why does it say wrong at the top?
04:35:16 Were we talking about giraffe rig?
04:35:19 Did I say something?
04:35:20 Did I cast dispersions on giraffe rig?
04:35:22 If so, I was wrong to do so.
04:35:24 Or maybe this is the voicemailer
04:35:27 who asked what your favorite gen two Pokemon is.
04:35:31 And this is a response, whatever we said.
04:35:33 Oh yes, it was.
04:35:35 Actually, it is that guy, something killer 930.
04:35:39 It's the same guy, so you're right.
04:35:42 Honestly, giraffe rig is pretty good.
04:35:44 Yeah, you've sold me with the same age.
04:35:47 Yeah.
04:35:50 All right, that's it, that's the last voicemail.
04:35:52 We're done.
04:35:53 Finally, it's been four and a half hours.
04:35:56 My God.
04:35:58 It's been almost five hours, actually.
04:36:00 Oh, really?
04:36:02 Well, no, no, four and a half.
04:36:04 Four, four 40 for me.
04:36:08 Damn.
04:36:09 Yeah.
04:36:09 Well,
04:36:16 any last words, gentlemen?
04:36:18 Gentlemen.
04:36:19 General people.
04:36:21 I'm looking at gen two Pokemon.
04:36:22 Which one do I wanna smash?
04:36:24 That's gonna be my favorite.
04:36:27 Is low-pony gen two?
04:36:28 No, that's beyond an Umbreon are in there.
04:36:30 They're decent.
04:36:33 It's really an Umbreon a lot.
04:36:35 Is that a lot in gen two that I wanna smash, to be honest?
04:36:39 I know it's a legendary and that's lame,
04:36:41 but I do kinda like Lugia.
04:36:43 I think Lugia is pretty cool.
04:36:45 Is Lugia the one with the baseball hands?
04:36:48 Baseball mitt hands, yeah.
04:36:50 Big catcher mitt hands.
04:36:51 They can catch any ball.
04:36:54 Damn, any ball, really?
04:36:59 Could even Lugia make a ball so big
04:37:02 that even he couldn't catch it?
04:37:04 Ah, it doesn't exist.
04:37:08 Oh, you know, I'm not very familiar with generation two.
04:37:10 I keep mixing up a bunch of them for being in generation three
04:37:14 because I hadn't played two when I played generation three.
04:37:19 So I assumed like Natu was generation three and stuff.
04:37:24 I didn't realize Corsola was gen two.
04:37:27 I thought he was newer than that.
04:37:31 Heracross is cool, I like Heracross a lot.
04:37:36 I like Foratress because he's a spear.
04:37:40 I do like Foratress a lot.
04:37:41 Foratress is awesome.
04:37:42 You know what?
04:37:43 I'm gonna actually gonna definitively say it's Crobat.
04:37:45 Crobat is my favorite gen two Pokemon.
04:37:49 This size or octelary is an odd one, isn't he?
04:37:53 Doesn't he evolve from just a fish?
04:37:56 Yeah, he evolves from Remorade.
04:37:58 Yeah, such a weird...
04:38:00 Did you know like Remorade is supposed to be like a gun?
04:38:05 No, you can sort of see it now,
04:38:10 but like Remorade's original design,
04:38:11 they did that gen two leak.
04:38:13 Remember all those unused sprites leaked?
04:38:15 Oh, yeah.
04:38:16 From like a previous very...
04:38:16 Yeah, the older version of Remorade just looked like a gun.
04:38:21 And I think the idea was that Remorade and octelary
04:38:24 were supposed to be like a gun evolves into like a tank.
04:38:26 A Gatling gun?
04:38:28 Oh.
04:38:28 An artillery platform, which is why it's called octelary.
04:38:32 Even though there's basically nothing octelary about it,
04:38:34 other than that it can shoot things out of its little mouth.
04:38:37 Yeah, it's such a like a just an octopus thing.
04:38:41 And then Remorade is just a fish
04:38:43 and they're not even the same color.
04:38:44 It's such a weird evolution.
04:38:46 Never understood it, but I guess now I get it.
04:38:49 They were going for something
04:38:50 and then they like chickened out.
04:38:53 Yeah.
04:38:54 Oh, Skarmory's really good.
04:38:55 Ooh, Skarmory's...
04:38:56 I thought Skarmory was gen three.
04:38:58 Skarmory's good.
04:39:00 I like Fan-P.
04:39:02 Oh, no, wait.
04:39:04 Is it says Fanny here?
04:39:07 Is it?
04:39:08 It's Fan-P, right?
04:39:09 Fan-P?
04:39:10 I thought it was Fan-P.
04:39:11 Well, Fan-P.
04:39:12 Oh, I don't know.
04:39:14 Bliss, I have a love-hate relationship with Blissie.
04:39:18 I wouldn't say it's my favorite.
04:39:19 No, Blissie ruined Pokemon Go for like months and months.
04:39:22 That's true.
04:39:23 That's true, but you gotta respect it.
04:39:27 I gotta destroy it.
04:39:31 Okay.
04:39:32 So we've settled on Crobat.
04:39:33 Crobat is the best.
04:39:34 Well, you like Crobat.
04:39:35 I kind of like Spinnerak.
04:39:37 Spiny Spinnerak.
04:39:39 Everybody loves Crobat.
04:39:40 I'm gonna go for Spinnerak
04:39:42 because it's a funny little squidgy spider.
04:39:45 I would buy a plush of Spinnerak.
04:39:48 I don't know if I'd buy a plush of Crobat,
04:39:49 although that would be funny.
04:39:53 Fair.
04:39:53 Fair enough.
04:39:55 All right.
04:39:56 That's it.
04:39:58 It's time to end this charade.
04:40:00 Yes.
04:40:02 So, hey, guys, remember,
04:40:06 we forgot to charge you for March.
04:40:09 Please give us some money.
04:40:11 Get in the Minecraft server for $5.
04:40:14 Get in the Minecraft server.
04:40:16 Build a cool thing
04:40:17 and we will look at it on stream.
04:40:20 We will...
04:40:21 Let's do a Minecraft soon.
04:40:24 Yeah.
04:40:25 Yeah.
04:40:26 Yeah, okay.
04:40:26 Yeah, we'll do that soon.
04:40:27 And I will probably be streaming Undertale right now
04:40:31 and this video comes out
04:40:32 playing it for the first time
04:40:34 with some people. Check out.
04:40:36 Check out Oblivion's...
04:40:37 Oh, right, right.
04:40:38 You'd not play...
04:40:39 Right.
04:40:40 You've never played Undertale.
04:40:41 Never played Undertale.
04:40:42 You've never played the best game ever.
04:40:44 Exactly.
04:40:45 The first PCP episode,
04:40:47 I actually skipped the first PCP episode.
04:40:49 I've never listened to it.
04:40:49 It's the one episode I never listened to it
04:40:51 when I got into it
04:40:52 because I'm like, I don't want to disclose
04:40:54 so we'll play this one game.
04:40:56 I know.
04:40:56 Crazy.
04:40:57 I always started with episode two.
04:40:58 Finally, go back and see where it all began.
04:41:01 Oh, God.
04:41:02 What was episode two?
04:41:04 It was like waifus.
04:41:06 Why, I think so.
04:41:08 I don't remember.
04:41:09 I think I listened to like half the first episode
04:41:10 and then like stopped because I'm like,
04:41:11 they talk about...
04:41:12 I wonder if I said Ryska even back then.
04:41:14 I can't even remember.
04:41:16 I'm sure you would have.
04:41:17 Sounds right to me.
04:41:19 You would have said Diamond Tiara back then.
04:41:22 Would I?
04:41:23 I feel like at that point,
04:41:25 I may have got into Homestuck.
04:41:27 You were talking?
04:41:28 I don't...
04:41:29 I remember...
04:41:30 No, you didn't get into Homestuck
04:41:31 until the PCP had been going for a while.
04:41:33 Are you sure?
04:41:34 Maybe.
04:41:35 I remember you got into Homestuck
04:41:38 because I was telling you about it.
04:41:40 Yeah.
04:41:41 And I'm pretty sure that was after
04:41:42 the PCP had already started.
04:41:44 I, well, I remember you telling me
04:41:47 but I don't remember when it was.
04:41:49 So...
04:41:50 I guess it could have been
04:41:51 when we were just the horseshoe crew.
04:41:53 I feel like it would have been in that time period.
04:41:56 But everyone, go back to the second episode
04:41:59 and find out.
04:42:01 All I remember is there was a conversation
04:42:03 where you talked about,
04:42:04 I'd like to get art with my waifus,
04:42:07 Diamond Tiara, Pacifica, et cetera,
04:42:10 but that I'll just be making fun of me
04:42:11 and call me a loser and it would be sad.
04:42:14 Is that what I said?
04:42:16 Yeah.
04:42:17 I ended up doing that though.
04:42:20 Yeah, I remember.
04:42:21 I had a little commission thing.
04:42:23 It's still on my background for my Gibb and Take channel
04:42:27 of me with Barger from Fire Emblem,
04:42:31 Diamond Tiara and Vriska.
04:42:34 And yeah, there they are.
04:42:39 Background for Gibb and Gaming.
04:42:41 Is it only visible in the full screen television view?
04:42:45 Oh, no, no, it's not Gibb and Gaming.
04:42:47 It's Gibb and Take, it's just the...
04:42:49 Oh, okay, yeah.
04:42:50 I was gonna say, because I know the image
04:42:51 you're talking about, I've seen it.
04:42:52 Yeah, I mean, that one's just cute, so.
04:42:57 Barger is good.
04:42:58 I've seen her around.
04:43:00 She's got a good look.
04:43:01 She's funny.
04:43:03 She's like sexually, what do you call it?
04:43:09 Forward to the player characters avatar,
04:43:13 regardless of your gender choice, which is very funny.
04:43:17 He just really likes you.
04:43:19 She's just gonna eat Foxip and Lyra.
04:43:20 Barger from Fire Emblem.
04:43:23 Oh, okay.
04:43:25 Not a player.
04:43:27 Did we even end the episode?
04:43:28 Goodbye.
04:43:29 No, yeah, okay, that's it.
04:43:31 Yeah, it's over.
