00:00:21 Er, two antennas met on a roof and got married. The ceremony wasn't much, but the reception was incredible.
00:00:28 Did it again.
00:00:30 That's a good one.
00:00:33 You did it.
00:00:34 Yes, you did it.
00:00:36 Thank you, thank you.
00:00:37 Gamer's Tavern show on YouTube. Check it out.
00:00:42 Classy epic. And we have Tectonic Improv as well.
00:00:45 Shout out to large chat.
00:00:48 Tectonic Improv, who I have mentioned, once or twice on the show, specifically for being the guy,
00:00:57 Well, he's got a YouTube channel and I've mentioned you because you did the
00:01:02 the PCP style lecture on
00:01:05 Linkart no on a top the fourth wall. Yeah, oh
00:01:09 I've seen like a bit of that. I keep thinking I'm gonna watch the whole thing, but I never get around to it
00:01:14 It's okay. Um, it's it's it's it's I kind of I kind of want to talk about that a little bit
00:01:21 Oh, yeah, I want to say it's a good. It's a good lecture. It's a good choice of topic for a lecture
00:01:28 and
00:01:29 Just I don't know. It's very it's very funny. I
00:01:33 I I knew I knew there was lore. I knew there was a top the fourth wall lore
00:01:38 But like I don't know just here hearing it described
00:01:41 Lynn in like a linear sequence of like this happened and therefore this happened and thus this happened is very very amusing it is
00:01:49 especially for
00:01:50 It feels like the perfect like lecture topic because it's yeah, it's very esoteric and
00:01:57 Yes, just
00:02:00 Like I was I
00:02:03 Was I used to watch Linkara like way back in the day when I was into like channel awesome and all that
00:02:09 So even back then I was like this is like kind of crazy. There it is. There it is the car running gift
00:02:15 I love this gift
00:02:16 Wait, I gotta I gotta see
00:02:19 Fuck I went to a different. I went to a different discord server. Why am I not looking at the right?
00:02:25 Okay, just go just go without me. Just forget about me Linkara's a funny
00:02:29 Gentleman he's he's interesting. It's not like on purpose. He's just yeah like that
00:02:36 He's I is he never funny on purpose? Um, well
00:02:41 He has moments I'd say
00:02:43 Like me
00:02:46 He's like I watched a bit of his videos back when I was like a that guy with the glasses head
00:02:52 And I was on that site and I was like, oh, I love
00:02:55 reviews
00:02:57 But I wasn't that big into comics. So I love when someone will watch it. So I don't have
00:03:04 Yeah, I I recall Linkara being like less funny than Spoonie and
00:03:11 But he was like considered one of the big three. So I didn't watch really anyone below him on the on the hierarchy
00:03:19 Only the only the choice the cream of the crop the few the proud
00:03:26 Haven't seen any of his stuff. I mostly watched
00:03:30 Guy with the glasses or what did he call himself dog walker or something?
00:03:36 Stolic
00:03:37 Nostalgia critic I've seen you know, do you know who link? Do you know who Linkara is I?
00:03:43 Know a little bit about him, but I haven't seen any of his content
00:03:46 He talks like this and he reveals comics
00:03:51 Kind of the thing. I'm I
00:03:54 Like I never watched that guy with the glasses or any channel awesome stuff like in its heyday. I just like missed that entire
00:04:01 Content train good the the most Linkara ever at one point
00:04:06 I went on like a very short atop the fourth wall binge
00:04:10 I just one day I put it on play for a while and I watched some and I was like, okay
00:04:14 This is fine and then another time I watched his Power Rangers series
00:04:19 Which is really good actually I was very because I was a big Power Rangers kid and I was like hmm
00:04:26 I remember Rita Rita repulsa and I remember Lord Zed and then I remember there were some like
00:04:33 machine cog people after that and I like what happened after that and
00:04:39 Now I know there was one where they were all cars. I
00:04:43 In case you remember they I remember really liking that retrospective. I used to watch it a lot
00:04:49 Yeah, so did I think I was like I
00:04:52 Was the one thing I was similar like I had seen the Power Rangers the movie with the ooze with Ivan ooze
00:04:59 Fuck yeah, Ivan ooze. Yeah, I saw that movie too. There's like what it was easy. So good
00:05:06 It's so good
00:05:09 Yeah, didn't you go like big giant robot himself?
00:05:13 Vote mode and like he was bigger than the planet and then they killed him
00:05:17 Yeah, that happened at the end
00:05:19 No, no Ivan ooze
00:05:22 Did that as well
00:05:25 Kara becomes like
00:05:28 He would he would I think it was actually he was piloting like some robot from a comic he read
00:05:33 I think that's what happened. I don't know if there's any sort of any sort of giant Linkara
00:05:38 Maybe there is cuz um
00:05:40 Cuz I finished I finished the lecture where there was like he was like halfway through a new saga
00:05:46 So I was like I won't cover. I won't bother covering that one
00:05:49 So maybe there is a giant Linkara. I admittedly I haven't watched
00:05:54 One can hold any sense. Yeah. Yeah, right. I mean fingers crossed. He's done pretty much everything else
00:05:59 It's it's been a while. It's been a while since I saw it. Does the lecture cover
00:06:04 Linkara lore that does it does it include um the the Vekai with the glasses like movies like too boldly flea and all that
00:06:13 I think I mentioned them
00:06:16 Uh
00:06:18 Like very are those cannon are those cannon to atop the fourth wall they kind of are
00:06:23 Sort of like they don't really matter in the main in the grand scheme of things. I think uh, I
00:06:30 Think to boldly flea has some has some connections to the main plotline because it like it
00:06:36 I think it's the cannon introduction or reintroduction of mechakara or something like like the point of to boldly flea and whatever the other
00:06:44 Movies are called the point of them is that they are like an avengers style like like meeting of all these characters together in one
00:06:57 Young it was cool. It was just legitimately cool. It was great. I dreamed of being part of I it's very funny
00:07:04 But I get it. I get the appeal completely. It's very of its time
00:07:08 I think um some of the things that like he has
00:07:12 Before the avengers though, right well a little bit and just was in a comic form before that
00:07:18 surely oh
00:07:20 I guess that's true
00:07:22 But like I feel like cross when I when I say an avengers style
00:07:26 Avengers have been around for decades. I think
00:07:29 Okay, but more more people are familiar with the movie version and like or like the idea of like all of these internet
00:07:36 Like video people
00:07:38 Coming together to do something together was sort of what was on a little bit unheard of at the time
00:07:43 At least at the scale that channel awesome was doing it. So and that way it's kind of cool
00:07:48 It makes way more sense for someone like lincara who does have like
00:07:53 Storylines then it does for someone like I don't know Todd in the shadows. Yeah
00:07:58 I don't I don't know if it was like this back then but like he doesn't have any plot in his no
00:08:03 He never has no, okay. Well, that's very weird. Just like that's like, oh my god
00:08:08 a
00:08:09 Galactic like like villain has appeared like the universe is in peril. Oh, thank god Todd in the shadows
00:08:17 Thank you. Todd's gonna save the day. It was really like reviewers are the best heroes
00:08:23 Christ it was it was like the I've watched all of the the meet-up films
00:08:29 Including the first one where it's just they were in a hotel
00:08:32 Lobby room fighting each other and it was like nostalgia critic versus the angry video game nerd, which is like where it all
00:08:38 Spiralled out from because they had a few because they were big at the time
00:08:41 It was it was really just nostalgia critic trying to make himself more popular by attaching himself to the angry video game
00:08:47 node, which was
00:08:49 a very smart move
00:08:51 Yeah, but like they had the first one was just a fight with everyone
00:08:56 Everyone just turned up. It's like who are you? I'm gonna beat you up and they just beat the shit out of each other
00:09:02 And it was very silly
00:09:03 The second one was like an attempt at actual like filmmaking
00:09:08 Uh, and it's laughable and it's it's kind of cute actually
00:09:12 um
00:09:13 There's a lot of funny stories of behind the scenes of these productions
00:09:18 That's like half the fun
00:09:20 But yeah, that one wasn't really like a super lore thing
00:09:22 It was just sort of like they understand that they are all part of that guy with the glasses
00:09:26 And the the joke is that nostalgia critic just says hey come over to this thing
00:09:30 He calls everyone and they're like why are we here? They just don't know they're just people
00:09:36 And they you know, some of them just happen to have super magic abilities or guns or whatever and they use they use their funny
00:09:42 reviewer gimmicks
00:09:43 in whatever happens
00:09:45 and then the third one
00:09:47 That was the the suburban nights, which is like a d&d thing in the suburbs
00:09:52 Wait, how many are there? There's this four
00:09:55 Okay, the suburban nights, uh
00:09:58 It's the same sort of thing like nostalgia critic calls everyone say hey
00:10:02 It's gotta do this thing and they're like fine. I guess I'll be in your review movie
00:10:08 And then it's the fourth one
00:10:11 To boldly flee is uh space. They just do the thing. There's like
00:10:15 Lore wise
00:10:17 Lore wise it makes no sense and they address that I think and but you know
00:10:22 When they have characters in their own reviews that are recurring lakara, especially he brings them in for certain things
00:10:30 I think lincara out of all the reviewers
00:10:33 Probably works the best in these crossover movies because he's the one who leans the most in on lore like spoony sort of did it
00:10:40 But not really to the extent that lincara did
00:10:43 I think lincara just really likes doing the lore stuff and honestly, um
00:10:48 Uh, I I I ended up really kind of like respecting it in a way. I just kind of liking it because I mean it's it's dumb
00:10:55 Yeah, but it's also
00:10:57 It's it's also kind of fun like it's it comes through like watching the lecture
00:11:01 I I started kind of respecting it too like he's real like he's really dedicated to like
00:11:08 Something will catch his eye and something he reviews. He'll decide that it's cool. He'll he'll you know
00:11:14 Uh co-opt it and put it into his own version into his like persona universe
00:11:19 Yeah, and then it will stay around and it will continue to get referenced like over and over again like for the rest of time
00:11:26 I and I think that's
00:11:28 I think that's kind of something that if like if anyone's like interested in making a lecture
00:11:31 I think you sort of have to in some degree respect or even like the thing you're covering
00:11:37 Because yeah, because if you come across if it comes across that you're like
00:11:43 you're you're not being
00:11:45 There's something lost if you like genuinely don't care or if you're or if you like dislike what you're talking about
00:11:52 Uh, yeah, like I had I had an idea
00:11:55 I I have ideas for like other lectures, but you know, there's like coven and all that crap
00:11:59 But um, but there was one idea I had in particular. Oh, yeah, I forgot about coven
00:12:04 Everyone did everybody forgets about that
00:12:07 I I had this idea for a lecture where I would cover um, I'd cover the game over thinkers story
00:12:13 And which is really funny. I was gonna say I was gonna say devoo used to talk about that he
00:12:19 She was gonna devoo came out like this week lamel
00:12:23 Uh, devoo was gonna do
00:12:24 The uh the uh the game over thinker lore and she never did and I always wanted to because I thought just like lincar
00:12:30 I was like, that's a perfect. I yeah, that's a perfect topic for it
00:12:33 I would love to see a game over thinker lecture, but the problem with me doing something like that is I uh,
00:12:39 I I fucking hate movie bob and I don't I don't respect him in the slightest. So if I I
00:12:45 I think I think I could hate movie bob, but also
00:12:49 I don't know if like I think the game I'm not super familiar with the game over thinker
00:12:54 but my impression of it is that it is very stupid, but
00:12:58 I I do find it genuinely amusing like when I like for the wrong reasons, maybe
00:13:04 But yeah, because he genuinely likes them or liked them at least at the time he would defend them. I think
00:13:10 Bob. Yeah, I mean bobber. Yeah
00:13:13 Bob
00:13:17 He really would like he really thought he was making like high art here
00:13:21 He really thought he was like elevating like people would say like bob
00:13:24 I just I just want to watch you review like movies and games and stuff
00:13:27 Like I don't like these skits and he's like, oh, well if you don't like it that I'm sorry
00:13:32 You know, I'm doing this to elevate my fucking craft. You know, you just don't appreciate my work
00:13:37 My I'm do this for you and you these pearls before swine. How can you not like the dark game over thinker?
00:13:43 All right, it's the most
00:13:44 It's the most intricate plot and loan to man
00:13:46 There's a man frozen from the from the 90s and he's back and he's going to jump off a building
00:13:52 I just it's high art because he came up with it while high
00:13:57 exactly
00:13:58 I just love movie balls probably like a straight edge. Oh, I was I was gonna say Bob would never do drugs. That's like
00:14:06 because
00:14:07 God
00:14:09 Did you I this week? I've been seeing that his old tweet floating around that's like that's like
00:14:15 I was supposed to be on a starship
00:14:18 Conversing with sentient robots and uploading my consciousness
00:14:22 Into a fucking robot body. I'll never forgive. I'll never forgive the people that took that future from me
00:14:28 I love it when when Bob accident accidentally
00:14:32 Just uh just inadvertently wants like eugenics and talks about it online. I think it's really funny
00:14:39 You know, it's it's it happens. He's not the only one that occasionally slips into it. But yeah
00:14:45 He does
00:14:46 I'm sorry. I'm sorry give. I think I cut you off earlier. What were you saying?
00:14:50 Yeah, I was just gonna say like the the stuff with linkara and and
00:14:55 movie bob and and all of these that guy with the glasses era like
00:15:00 Terrible like awful but like sort of endearing
00:15:03 Um attempts at making you know, they review things and they try to make them the things themselves in a way
00:15:09 And they always suck in the in the in this sort of style
00:15:13 And it's just it gives me the same vibes as sonichu. But in in a way that I you know, I like sonichu
00:15:19 I kind of admire game over thinker is very sonichu
00:15:22 It's it's how it's like it's so bad
00:15:25 But the fact that they care about it and work really hard to make it. It's just sort of nice and I just kind of like it
00:15:30 Link link like ironically cars. I think link cars is a little bit more like
00:15:35 It's more high after I'd say
00:15:37 Especially later on I would say link cars is it's a little it's more high effort
00:15:42 But also I get the and this is it's amazing to say this about linkara
00:15:47 But I genuinely think linkara is a little more self-aware that like what he's doing is like silly than bob is
00:15:55 I think I think so too imagine come across too much to like uh onlookers on linkara and his persona
00:16:01 But I do I do think like I mean he actually commented on my lecture
00:16:06 Like really? Yeah, I think I saw that. Yeah, I pinned it back when he watched it
00:16:11 And it's just uh, he's like talking or he just like quotes the video
00:16:16 uh, we're like people just
00:16:19 All right, I think one of one of the uh, one of the people who was in the audience for the lecture
00:16:24 It was just like shocked at the fact that I had been talking for I think like
00:16:28 20 minutes and we were only at like the first part of the story
00:16:32 Yeah, I I think I I think I should probably talk about this because um
00:16:38 Because uh, I I've noticed like a lot of comments about this lecture
00:16:42 Whenever whenever people talk about it
00:16:44 And I think you per you were probably gonna bring this up to ben about how like the audience
00:16:48 Probably kind of wasn't really into it
00:16:50 I was gonna mention it
00:16:51 I could I can tell that like you you shanghide some of your friends into sitting down for this thing
00:16:58 And they did it and you got them to agree to it and a couple of them were maybe like not
00:17:03 Actually prepared. Yeah, and I so like I
00:17:08 I told them I told them ahead of time like hey
00:17:11 Do you can you guys help me out with this like this like lecture idea?
00:17:14 I have where I'm going to like explain this stuff in front of like a camera for whatever
00:17:18 And uh, I I think I gave them your sonichu lecture and like this is what it's kind of gonna be like
00:17:23 and uh, I
00:17:24 You know, maybe they didn't watch it
00:17:26 But also on the other hand like I I made them sit down for two and a half hours to talk about something
00:17:31 They don't they don't fucking care. They don't care about we cara. So like
00:17:36 I I feel I feel kind of bad
00:17:38 Um, I don't because because I see people in the comment section sort of sort of like blame my friends too much
00:17:43 And and I I gotta you know, I gotta play defense because you know, they're my friends, but
00:17:48 Yeah, I mean
00:17:50 I yeah, like I I get it
00:17:53 I get I get how
00:17:56 It's a little annoying that some of them seem to be kind of not some of them some of them seem to get a little annoyed
00:18:03 But yeah, I can understand like thinking about how you set up an event like this
00:18:08 I can understand how it comes
00:18:10 Or to this I don't know
00:18:12 It's it's kind of just funny like when you and that one guy sort of like get pissed at each other
00:18:18 It's just pretty funny actually. It's like oh, oh, what's this? Oh, what's gonna happen? Oh, it's okay. Oh, it's okay
00:18:23 It's okay. Well, I I appreciate that at least someone likes likes what the the emergent narrative
00:18:31 Of the lecture. That's how I that's how I see it. Uh, I
00:18:35 You gotta do a lecture about this that
00:18:38 Oh man, uh, uh, one of my friends feels really bad about uh about how the lecture came out
00:18:44 And I always have to tell him that it's like it's fine. It's not a big deal
00:18:48 Yeah, it's not that big. It's not it's really not and like I would I would love to do to do another one with them
00:18:53 And I I think I think they'd be a lot more behaved
00:18:57 That's how that's how you do it because now you've um, you know, you've broken their will. Mm true
00:19:03 Now now they'll be docile. They know what they're in for and uh
00:19:07 No, hopefully they'll be more behaved next time
00:19:12 I had another question. I know the youtube question for you. Did you're um you the the fucking um, oh god
00:19:20 The dx video game man
00:19:22 Oh, oh, oh that come back that that's the other that was the second videos of yours. I saw and I liked it
00:19:29 um, all right, so uh
00:19:31 To anyone unaware which I assume is both give gamers tavern and most of the people watching this, uh, I uh want to like
00:19:38 I started making videos back in
00:19:40 2017 I think and um one of the first ever videos I did was uh, it was like a
00:19:47 A recommendation video for this this japanese television show called game center cx
00:19:52 I heard of that which which is uh, uh, I think
00:19:57 I think most people would probably be familiar as the source of the his smile and optimism gone
00:20:01 Yeah, it's it the premise of the show is that this this uh,
00:20:06 Japanese like comedian plays retro video games and tries to beat them in like a day
00:20:11 And uh, you know like comedy
00:20:13 Comes out of these situations. He has to like help
00:20:15 Yeah, he has to get like his like producers or directors to like help him out in certain sections
00:20:21 It's a really good show and uh, I wanted to make a youtube video kind of just like recommending it to people
00:20:26 As a recommendation video, it was good because it really did make me want to watch the series
00:20:31 But I never actually did that the so I guess it wasn't good enough
00:20:34 It it it's fine because it's kind of hard to find online at least nowadays
00:20:39 I believe the the guy's name is arino or something arino. Yeah, uh shinya arino
00:20:45 Yeah, I've seen a lot of his stuff
00:20:48 He's pretty good pretty cool. He's really great. I I love the show a lot and um
00:20:54 the
00:20:55 The basic idea of the video was that like I pretty much give a rundown of the plot
00:20:59 Of of the show why I like it and I gave a bunch of like recommendations for
00:21:04 Several episodes if that video sounds cool and you wanted to watch it
00:21:10 I'm sorry, but
00:21:11 It got taken down like a month ago
00:21:14 On uh, it it got copyright striked by uh by the people who own game center cx because you know, I
00:21:21 Use footage from the show in the video and like I I can't really be too
00:21:27 Like surprised about it. I'm disappointed obviously, but like
00:21:31 Back in like 2014 or 15 or so like uh, the rights the rights owners. I think fuji tv
00:21:39 They started they started going like really draconian on game center cx on youtube
00:21:43 so
00:21:45 It was only a matter of time before it uh, it got struck it got struck
00:21:49 And I think the reason why it got struck now of all times is I recently passed like a thousand subscribers
00:21:56 So I got monetization on my videos
00:21:59 So I that that might have that might have uh tipped them off
00:22:02 The you you attract you drew the eye of sorrow. It's yeah
00:22:07 We know how it is uh fair use doesn't exist on youtube it exists only in the courts
00:22:13 Yeah, well what what sucks even harder about it is uh
00:22:17 Is I also got copyright struck for uh for this like amv I did a few months ago around the same time
00:22:24 I I got monetization obviously I didn't monetize that video but
00:22:28 So I have two strikes on my channel
00:22:30 And uh, if I make another oopsie within I think the next like 10 days, uh, my channel's gone
00:22:36 Oh, that's not good. Yeah, uh, so I'll have to be a little more careful. It's it's not it's not that bad
00:22:43 I'm more just disappointed that um
00:22:45 I wasn't really that disappointed when the amv got taken down because you know
00:22:49 It was really more of an like an indulgent side project
00:22:53 But I was really sad when the game center video got taken down because that was like that was like one of my first videos
00:22:59 Where I was like, yeah, I really like this and it was one of the
00:23:02 It was one of my only videos that uh from early on that isn't like
00:23:07 based off of other people's work that is
00:23:09 That that that did good
00:23:11 In like the yeah, I saw I saw you tweet that it was down and I was like, oh fuck
00:23:17 I remember liking that video and uh, just I don't know. It's damn shame
00:23:21 I'll have to find some other way to like upload it, but whatever. Yeah an archive. It's somehow. Yeah, it's still on my computer
00:23:28 You know, it's uh, I played actually a game based on the game center
00:23:33 Dx show back in 2009 for the ds retro game challenge. Yeah
00:23:39 Yeah, yeah, I've actually never played that game, but I heard yeah, I've heard it's great
00:23:43 Uh, I have a review on it on my website actually
00:23:47 I'll have to read that I published a view. What did you give it? Um, I don't remember. I think like an 80%
00:23:53 or something. All right, respectable. Yeah, respectable. Yeah, I published a review back. Um
00:24:00 Uh, I published a review actually back when I played it in 2009
00:24:05 damn
00:24:06 I forget how I always forget that like you've been doing this for a really long time gamers 7
00:24:13 Like yeah, for some reason I've been doing it for too long
00:24:17 Sometimes I feel like I've been doing this for too long
00:24:20 So coming coming up close to the 20 year anniversary
00:24:24 Are you gonna throw a party?
00:24:27 Uh, just a website itself or the brand I guess you can say
00:24:31 Yeah
00:24:34 You should have a party you should have a
00:24:37 Zoom a zoom call. I'll come I'll come to the zoom party. Yeah, that's a good idea
00:24:43 Maybe you could do a stream
00:24:45 Yeah
00:24:46 Yeah
00:24:49 Yes, hopefully hopefully covid would be done by then
00:24:53 Hopefully
00:24:55 God bless god willing
00:24:57 mwah
00:25:01 So, uh, I don't know what else? Um, well, what else is up? I can I can talk about this thing that was going on
00:25:09 Um, was there any more to say about about the any of that before we move on? Oh, oh, please continue talking about my
00:25:17 Yeah, no, it's it's okay
00:25:20 Uh, check out gamers 7 on youtube.com. Okay
00:25:24 Yeah, I mean tectonic impromptu. No, fuck gamers 7 never sit
00:25:29 Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah, sure everyone check to do it. Just spread it out spread love. Sorry
00:25:34 All right, fuck me. I'm sorry. I'll leave. I'll go. I'll go. I apologize
00:25:39 by the uh, so I have been
00:25:42 um
00:25:43 Past month past few weeks helping my brother to clear out his room
00:25:49 Uh, because it is I know about this because I listen to the money spenders podcast. Yeah, the money
00:25:55 com slash give and take
00:25:57 Give and take the money spenders podcast the only place where you should spend your money
00:26:02 Um, it's a great place to do that if you're looking for somewhere
00:26:08 uh, but uh
00:26:10 Yeah, I've been helping him clear out all of the junk
00:26:12 We've been going through all of the shelves and things and like holding them up to his face
00:26:17 Like do you care about this? Is this important to you? It's like, uh, I guess I don't know
00:26:22 Bags bags upon bags of trash. It's great
00:26:25 It's really satisfying to see it being clean and he's obviously happy that he can move around in there
00:26:31 And then I was looking at my room and I was like
00:26:34 I gotta do the same thing to my room. Even though it's not as bad
00:26:37 It's still like there's there's shelves of books here that I've never read
00:26:42 And I always say to myself, I'll read these
00:26:45 And I was thinking how do I gamify because I'm like I'm stupid like I like I can't do things unless there's a video game
00:26:53 Involved need to have achievements
00:26:55 Yeah, I need I need like to gamify reading all these books
00:26:59 And so that I can get rid of them and have shelf space to put more video games
00:27:04 Or something stupid like that
00:27:06 And I was thinking what if what if I like
00:27:09 first of all
00:27:10 Because I I like listing things
00:27:13 I was thinking of like making an itinerary of everything I have
00:27:16 And then doing like a list and being like, all right, let's
00:27:19 100 percent complete these books by reading them and then I don't know rating them on a youtube video saying
00:27:27 This book sucked. This book was good. And then throwing them away. Finally after all these years
00:27:32 I can get rid of these this trash
00:27:35 You can uh, don't eat garbage
00:27:37 Can't you burn the books?
00:27:39 I do when I get rid of them. I donated like charity shop thing to the trash that is
00:27:44 Yeah, don't make them back to the earth. My scuttle read too
00:27:49 Um, so I throw them in the in a in a pit. Have you have you done any book reading? No
00:27:57 Okay, look, look, she's only introduced the concept. She she still needs to she still needs to work on the execution. It's fine
00:28:04 I have I have I have a certain I have a gripe
00:28:08 I have something you know what really grinds my gears what really grinds my gears
00:28:13 Stop me if I've said this on the show before
00:28:15 Um, but fucking fucking uh last year for christmas
00:28:21 I gave uh the conquest of bread by kropotkin to my sister
00:28:26 My brother to my to my brother nate and to nate's girlfriend michelle. I heard about this from michelle
00:28:33 And yeah, good and michelle. Well, you heard about it from her. Uh, yeah, I think so on like your twitter or something
00:28:40 Oh, yeah, yeah, um no clue
00:28:42 And she maybe in the discord uh she she and she said she was gonna read 50 books this year
00:28:49 And she's like she she's like almost there. She's read like 40 something books. It's almost the end of the year
00:28:54 48 and she has not read
00:28:57 She's read 50 books. She has not read the book that I gave her the conquest of bread. It's literally like 100 pages
00:29:03 It's like shorter than a fucking animorphs book
00:29:06 She has not read it
00:29:07 But she keeps posting the book she's read and every single book she's read is some stupid self-help book about how cleaning your room
00:29:14 Will make you happier. That's every single fucking book
00:29:18 How many how many books do you need to read that tell you to clean your room?
00:29:23 Just fucking do it or don't we're all those books written by jordan peterson
00:29:30 No, she reads the girl version Marie condo
00:29:33 Marie condo, I mean, I've heard those are youtuber. I was watching and he cited that as like, oh, it's a really good book
00:29:39 I'm sure it's a great book. I'm sure it's a great. He disseminated all the information in that book into one sentence
00:29:45 So now I don't have to read it. He said
00:29:48 In the book they say look it around to your room and
00:29:51 See if what you have sparks joy and if it doesn't spark joy, consider getting rid of things
00:29:58 Consider fucking get ending it all
00:30:01 What if like I was like looking and owning things just makes me feel good
00:30:06 I love
00:30:07 Looking at things like I have a bunch of shit in my room. You're like a dwarf. Well, yeah
00:30:13 You're like a dwarf who gets happy when they observe a masterwork craft
00:30:19 When they see when they see like a nice like a really like nice like artifact like great in the floor with like
00:30:25 With like engraving. It's like masterwork quality with like engravings of carrots on it. You go. Ah, yes, the neurons are firing
00:30:35 Um, fuck you michel
00:30:38 Don't
00:30:43 At least she's doing it despite you
00:30:46 Uh
00:30:47 Just fucking bread books a good book. It's a good book. I it's short. It's digestible
00:30:53 I used to have I used to have a problem where like my room would be
00:30:57 hopelessly messy
00:30:59 And I don't know what happened, but just like one day I was like, I'm gonna clean my room
00:31:03 This is way before jordan pierced and by the way before he was even born and uh, I just spent
00:31:08 I spent the day I spent the day cleaning
00:31:11 You were the original jordan. I really was I really was I spent the day cleaning my room and it looked I mean it looked
00:31:17 Decent it looked fine. It looked fine enough. There were there were places to walk around
00:31:21 There wasn't clothes strung along the floor and like ever since I've never really had a problem with having a dirty room
00:31:26 It's not yeah, it's not in the best shape right now, but it's you know, it's presentable. I guess maybe
00:31:33 I have um
00:31:34 Because I just I basically just finished up um all the um all my kickstarter stuff
00:31:39 I had all these boxes all around my room is pretty small and I had like half of it just taken up with like
00:31:45 Boxes and like packing materials and like piles of envelopes and piles of books and stuff
00:31:51 And I I have only just like like yesterday on the day before I like
00:31:55 You know packed all that shit up and like put it in put it in in the closet and stuff
00:32:00 And like put it in a stack and put it like behind my my little like side room curtain or whatever and uh
00:32:06 It actually doesn't feel much different
00:32:08 um
00:32:09 Uh
00:32:10 I don't know i'm i'm
00:32:12 I feel like it felt like it was all cluttered
00:32:15 And so I put everything away and honestly it doesn't feel that much less cluttered and i'm a little disappointed frankly
00:32:21 The change I didn't the change wasn't drastic enough
00:32:24 It wasn't drastic enough
00:32:26 It wasn't like because I I was keeping a lot of it under my my like table
00:32:30 so
00:32:31 Like you know, it wasn't like space that I was losing
00:32:35 Yeah
00:32:35 Now the now the space under my table is just empty and it's just wasted. So like whatever
00:32:41 I don't know. I thought it was gonna be like, uh, I'm gonna feel so much mental clarity after like I remove all this clutter
00:32:47 and I put it away and
00:32:49 Oh, no, my mind is still cluttered
00:32:52 Fuck you can organize your room, but you can't organize your mind
00:32:57 What do you mean do I live in a triangle then you have like a like a triangle room is really small from what I've seen
00:33:03 A triangle room
00:33:06 The ceiling is slanted, isn't it?
00:33:09 Oh, um on one side it is. Yeah, I used to have one of those kind of rooms
00:33:14 They have like a name for them. It's like something about it's like it's not like an attic room, but it's
00:33:20 My room is not my room is not a bedroom
00:33:23 It is um
00:33:24 It is it is technically like a side. Although it's not although it's not much smaller than the bedrooms
00:33:30 Um by floor space, but I guess in terms of sheer volume
00:33:33 It is smaller because it does have the the slanted roof. I think it just sort of makes it feel
00:33:38 Basically, I haven't been there, but in video. I've seen
00:33:42 That one video where it's like it feels claustrophobic, but I don't know
00:33:46 I think there's like a zoning thing where where like a bedroom
00:33:50 Can only be considered a bedroom if it's like something square feet and has like a window
00:33:56 Your room has a window, right?
00:33:59 My room actually has very nice windows. My room it has
00:34:03 It's it's about the same size as the as like the regular bedrooms in terms of floor space
00:34:07 It's it's missing volume because it's got the slanted roof. It's got like a half closet like a low half closet
00:34:14 Um that you that is only like up to like my my chest height
00:34:17 Um and that's next to my bed and then it's actually got it's got a little side alcove that I have some bookshelves in
00:34:24 And I have a hanger bar between the two ends like between the two walls of this little like side alcove
00:34:30 The alcove also has a little slanted roof and I have a nice piece of modern art
00:34:35 Uh, uh nailed to the the slanted like like half roof up there. Oh, what's it's name? I?
00:34:42 I it's nameless uncultured. It's it's it's but it's but it's an original. It's an original
00:34:48 Your room is uh your room is missing volume like a lost book
00:34:54 You know lost volume. Oh got it. I thought you were gonna go
00:34:58 Sound decibels. Um wait. I gotta finish but then the alcove
00:35:02 I have my little hanger bar and I have my I have like sweaters and jackets hanging on that
00:35:07 And it makes like a nice little curtain to sort of cordon off that little alcove. It's really nice
00:35:11 It's really I planned it out so beautifully and the behind that I have bookshelves and then on the wall
00:35:16 I don't just have one window. I have the nicest windows in the whole house
00:35:19 I have a big like three window thing
00:35:22 I have one huge window that like takes up half the wall and then I have two little windows to the sides of it
00:35:26 My like front wall is like all window. It's like mwah. Mwah
00:35:31 And then because I need to sleep until like 6 p.m
00:35:35 And go to bed at like 10 a.m. Every day
00:35:38 I just have all I have them all blackout curtain. I have like stuff like
00:35:44 Hanging up over the window so I can't see out of them and no light gets in
00:35:47 It's a very economical setup. It really makes a whole lot of sense. I had um, I had blackout curtains for a bit
00:35:53 They were pretty cool, but I didn't really have much need for them
00:35:57 I didn't have them for a while because I was on like a reasonable sleep schedule
00:36:01 But then like a month or two ago, uh that
00:36:05 Changed and now I need the blackout curtains again lemau
00:36:09 Well, my room is pretty organized
00:36:13 uh at all times
00:36:15 Kind of a bit of a neat boy neat freak
00:36:19 Really, I just imagined gamer's tavern's room kind of looks like how ridin's room is described in middle gear solid 2
00:36:26 It's just the bed and the desk nothing else. Yeah, that's pretty much it
00:36:32 It's um empty and sterile just like my soul
00:36:39 Spartan
00:36:40 Yeah, I mean
00:36:42 You don't have you don't have the vice the vice of possession holding you
00:36:45 You don't you don't feel the need to have things in your room to fill the void in your heart. You just have puns
00:36:51 Well, I used to uh own a lot of uh video games, but a couple years back
00:36:56 I sold I think over 300 or 400 games
00:37:00 So that really freed up a lot of space on this
00:37:04 I I just hate the idea of games being sold. I don't I don't know why I even if they're selling anything
00:37:10 I I hate when I'm getting real stuff
00:37:12 when I was fucking um when I was like uh
00:37:17 In high school or something or maybe earlier. I don't remember. I think I was trying to get money
00:37:22 Me and Nate were trying to get money for a I think was for a playstation 2
00:37:26 Oh, yeah, and so we sold and so we sold a bunch of our old nes games
00:37:31 We sold them to gamestop and gamestop gave us like the worst fucking price for them
00:37:35 Like admittedly a lot of them are genuinely just worthless
00:37:38 But we had an original nes copy of kid Icarus
00:37:41 That actually is kind of rare and like actually we should have actually gotten like a bit of I think they give us like eight bucks for
00:37:48 Yeah, you should never uh sell anything to gamestop. That's a complete waste of money. Yeah less than learned
00:37:53 Yeah, less than learned that like around the time the playstation 2 was new was also like the
00:37:59 Probably like the time when like nes and super nintendo games were probably at like their lowest value
00:38:04 No one gave a shit about them until like
00:38:06 Well, um, uh, probably around the time that video game reviewers started popping up on youtube
00:38:13 It was that really was that before that was a thing. I don't yeah, I think I
00:38:18 I know that um, they contributed to the games now are quite uh quite pricey. Yeah
00:38:24 Let me see what it what it would cost now kid
00:38:28 Icarus nes
00:38:30 Nes games actually are not too expensive now, but for some reason super nintendo games have gone up a lot
00:38:35 Well, they're it's the best console. So
00:38:38 Of course, yeah, I agree
00:38:42 PS2 is the best one because I I'll concede I'll concede the ps2. In fact, you know what um here
00:38:49 I'm going to shill a friend of mine's channel
00:38:51 uh
00:38:52 Who the who is reviewing every playstation 2 game known to man
00:38:58 Oh, is it um, is it no? Yeah, it's no no
00:39:01 Yeah, no toxicity
00:39:04 Another friend of the show we all I I you you and uh, and and uh him or both
00:39:11 I I mostly know you from my discord. Yeah, we're you guys are long time
00:39:17 Uh hangers out in there. We're from we're from way back the from from the way way back the dark ages
00:39:24 Uh
00:39:27 Yes, and I I saw he just passed like a thousand subs too. He did I'm I'm really happy for him because and like
00:39:34 I have a feeling reps to gog is like very close to to kind of blowing up in a way because the concept of the channel
00:39:41 What does it stand for? We review every ps2 game. Oh god
00:39:46 Okay, it's I've seen that and recommend it. I'm surprised. It's only like a thousand subs
00:39:52 It's he he only started it like um, like
00:39:55 Maybe
00:39:56 Six months or so ago
00:39:58 It's it's going it's going to blow up because the concept is so
00:40:01 It's just so like as an idea for a channel. It's only a matter of time. I was like, oh cool
00:40:07 I I would definitely want to get around to that. I assumed it was already a big channel
00:40:11 Just because I I don't get recommended small channels usually
00:40:14 It's it's really funny how the how the idea for like reps to gog started because me null and
00:40:21 A couple of other friends were just in a discord call it for in the morning
00:40:24 I don't remember who it was who brought it up
00:40:26 But like someone was like what if what if we made like a youtube channel where we reviewed every single playstation 2 game
00:40:32 And of course it was like 4 a.m. So we're like, oh, this is there must be like race idea ever
00:40:35 There must be like a thousand games on the playstation 2. It'll be quite an honor taking
00:40:40 I think it has the most besides maybe the we yeah
00:40:44 That's that's part of the appeal
00:40:46 I think the other thing is
00:40:48 It would literally go on for like 10 years
00:40:51 If you did one every week, I think I think he did the calculations where like he would be finished with him in like
00:40:56 In like over 70 years if he did a video
00:41:00 Yeah, because a lot of these games are like uh 50 hour rpgs
00:41:04 Yep
00:41:05 Yeah, he just he just recently finished a video of a um
00:41:09 Of like a tactical rpg
00:41:11 And I think I think it's his best video he's made so far
00:41:14 So if you're interested then yeah, check out his uh his review of eternal poison
00:41:20 Eternal poison. Yeah, I'm surprised I've never heard of that because tactical rpgs were my favorite genre back in the p2 era
00:41:26 It was like a it was like a late release. I think it came out in like 2006 or seven
00:41:32 Okay
00:41:33 Hmm
00:41:34 neat
00:41:35 Yeah
00:41:36 Yeah, continuing on the idea of like 100 completing my shelf
00:41:41 I have
00:41:43 Had a like list of every game that I could conceivably play at any time
00:41:48 Uh, which is like all the games I physically own all the games that are downloaded on my ps3 and ps4
00:41:54 All the games in my steam and epic games libraries and all that
00:41:58 And I'm like sometimes I just go to that list and I look at all of the things I've I've like
00:42:04 Organized it so that I can search by release date and and stuff like that and I've always wanted to like
00:42:11 Complete all of them just because it sucks to have things purchased and never played and never done anything with even if
00:42:19 They suck and I would not like them. I just want to say I did play them. You need to get blood out of that stone
00:42:25 Yeah, I feel the same way
00:42:27 A few years ago. I started an account on backloggery. I think it's backloggery dot something
00:42:34 Uh, so I've been keeping track of everything I've finished and need to finish on on that site
00:42:40 And it's pretty useful to that end
00:42:43 Yeah, like making reviews is a good like I
00:42:47 It's a very good concept that we review every ps2 game because it's just like a very good, you know
00:42:52 Excuse to to play a lot of ps2 games that you would have never given a second thought like I'll get around to that like 40 years later
00:43:01 Yeah, it's turn to dust and you've also turned to dust
00:43:04 So it's like it does seem a little bit unrealistic though. Um
00:43:08 Yeah, the the iconography of the channel is supposed to be like sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill
00:43:16 Yeah, so so like in that very clever
00:43:19 I I think you're
00:43:21 The at the point the idea of the channel at least for for for my for my lens is that uh
00:43:27 Is that it's like you everyone is aware that this is like
00:43:31 Impossible, but you want to see how far it can go anyway, you know
00:43:36 Hmm
00:43:36 I mean the the right thing to do if you wanted to actually complete it would be to have like a team and
00:43:42 Certain people only play and review certain games and you would have that's that's kind of how this started
00:43:49 Was uh, you had a crowd source it because I because me and a couple of other friends were
00:43:55 were uh
00:43:56 We're supposed to also do reviews in fact if you go like early
00:44:00 Early into the channel's life you can see that there's a couple of other
00:44:03 Other people reviewing the games like I I made a review on Unreal Tournament for the ps2 on there
00:44:10 Uh, and I think I also reviewed a this game orphan scion of sorcery
00:44:16 Yeah, I played that I know that one. It's not good
00:44:19 Yeah, that's uh, that was one of the first ones I got for the ps2. It was yeah, it was a launch title
00:44:25 um
00:44:25 So and like that was that was the idea that like we all we all pitch in and make like reviews
00:44:30 It's like a collective thing, but like, you know
00:44:34 We just kind of all sort of fell off except for null, you know, god bless him. He's the only one who's really kept the torch alive
00:44:40 I I just kind of wanted to focus more on on like the main channel stuff
00:44:45 but um, yeah, I
00:44:47 I'm definitely open to making more for his channel because
00:44:51 Because I like the I like the concept so much and I would love to write his coattails when he gets popular
00:44:57 Haha, that's how you do it. I think somebody has already done this idea for NES games, uh, probably
00:45:04 Which is a lot more doable. I think it was devoo. It was devoo
00:45:09 She was um, she had the idea to to let's play to let's play every NES game
00:45:14 And then they they had a few episodes where they did let's play is what back when let's plays were a thing everyone was doing
00:45:20 Remember let's play and she would have she had like a big master file of every NES game
00:45:24 And she would just play one for like five minutes and be like, okay got it next one
00:45:28 Okay, this sucks or this is fine. Uh, but I get it. Yeah, and it's like per per episode
00:45:34 There was like, I don't know three or four they would do because like devoo actually wanted to like
00:45:40 structure
00:45:41 She wanted to structure it in a in such a way that it could actually be feasibly
00:45:45 Completable, but I don't think they got very far
00:45:48 Um, even though they were only doing a few minutes on each game
00:45:51 Well, there is a there is a let's play. I've been watching brother. I remember like
00:45:56 I think I remember that devoo's brother was really annoying
00:46:00 Or maybe wasn't her brother. Someone was really annoying and would like yell and I found it very off-putting
00:46:05 Is that the brother that like broke a hole in her door one night or something?
00:46:11 I don't know that story, but maybe I remember I remember her talking about it on the pcp a long time ago
00:46:17 Oh nest quest nest quest was what those were called and someone would yell and I hated them
00:46:24 We need a reboot player late
00:46:26 Well, uh, there was a there's a let's play. I've been following for over 10 years now named zeta plays
00:46:32 And uh, he's been trying to play every single uh, super nintendo nes and genesis game
00:46:39 ever made
00:46:42 How far he's been doing it for a while
00:46:44 I think he has around 10 000 subscribers now. That's cool
00:46:49 The lifelong endeavor there's there's this other guy who who makes um
00:46:54 Who who makes like uh retrospective videos his name's uh, jeremy perish
00:46:59 He he's oh, yeah, I know him. Yeah, he has this uh
00:47:03 He has these retrospectives called like nes works gameboy works and all that stuff and like the point of them is to
00:47:09 Chronicle every single game and he he has he has like a lot of production value behind him because uh, he's like one of the
00:47:16 One of the guys behind like retronauts
00:47:19 Uh, he used to work. I think he used to work for one up. He did. Yeah or something, right?
00:47:24 Yeah, so he's he's like he's like legit site
00:47:27 And he's done he's done like all sorts of other
00:47:31 Retrospectives like he he has covered every single virtual boy game
00:47:35 Like he just spent like a year doing all the virtual boy games, which admittedly it isn't much, but
00:47:40 It's uh, it's still they're great videos. I'd recommend it. I I did the the same thing on my website
00:47:45 I reviewed every single virtual boy game one year
00:47:49 Oh, yeah
00:47:51 Yeah, even like the japanese only ones
00:47:53 Yeah, and I also reviewed some of the prototypes that were never officially released. Oh, yeah
00:48:01 That's the virtual boy is like weird because
00:48:04 It's
00:48:05 Wait, wait, wait. I okay. I swear. I've seen a video from like the the gaming historian
00:48:11 And I think he went over every virtual boy game and there's like eight of them
00:48:15 Uh, they're am I am I crazy? I think there's like 20 something, but there there really isn't a lot
00:48:20 Yeah, I think there's around 16 to 20 something
00:48:23 probably around that much
00:48:25 It's you know, it's not as impressive as reviewing every ps2 game, but you know a lot of these virtual boy games aren't that great and
00:48:33 Yeah, that's that's the entire reason why I reviewed all of them because I figured there's not that many of them
00:48:37 Might as well just do them all. Yep. Yeah
00:48:41 For all the like people that still own a virtual boy
00:48:45 Yeah, why is why is completing things so fucking satisfying? It just feels so fucking good. It's on our bones
00:48:51 Even if it would never happen the idea of somebody cataloguing all video games like there's too many
00:48:56 There's too many of any one console for one person to play in a reasonable amount of time
00:49:01 And then also talk about them. But the idea is just so tantalizing
00:49:05 I I love it. I want to do it all the time
00:49:09 I think part of it is the is like the idea that like
00:49:13 Uh, like for the viewers like
00:49:16 Oh, eventually
00:49:18 He will review or they will review the game. I like and I can't wait for that
00:49:23 And whereas like the person
00:49:26 Making them or or whatever
00:49:29 They it's just it's just a good way to have like
00:49:33 A structured channel and like a body of work, right?
00:49:37 Yeah, it gives you plenty of content. Yeah
00:49:41 but um
00:49:42 You know yms your movie sucks. Yeah. Yeah, I know him he he does those the videos of like best movies of x year
00:49:51 And his gimmick is that he watches every single movie that came out in that year, which is why they're so late
00:49:57 And they come out years after
00:49:59 They come out like yeah like years late and that's crazy like that gimmick is why I really am
00:50:06 Hype for those even though I don't care about
00:50:09 Basically everything he talks about right movies. I don't care about all of the art house films
00:50:14 It's nice to know it's just nice to know that he has watched everything from that year and this is his favorite
00:50:20 I think I find yms's taste in movies a little dumb
00:50:23 Honestly, I don't know if I really agree with
00:50:27 Like some things that I that I like but there are definitely some movies that he likes that I think are stupid
00:50:32 Have have you ever?
00:50:34 Uh, jeez. I'm gonna open a can of worms with this. I can tell uh, have you ever seen anomaliesa?
00:50:43 Have not it's it was a um, it's like a
00:50:46 It's like a stop motion. I think stop motion like puppet movie by a is it
00:50:51 Yeah, who's it by uh, uh charlie kaufman. I think
00:50:55 Okay, or and it's it's also written by like one of the guys who did moral oral and um
00:51:00 Yeah, that's like one that's like one of yms's movies like favorite movies ever and I knew this
00:51:07 And I was recommended it like I think last month or so to watch it and I watched it and I was like
00:51:13 I I could like kind of see why people like it
00:51:17 But it it definitely was like
00:51:19 Not for me and I feel like that's the case for a lot of a lot of adam's tastes
00:51:25 Yeah, but it's like but I respect it. You know despite despite not having the same movie taste or even caring so much about movies that
00:51:34 It's the completionist aspect that really gets me interested like knowing the fact that he has seen
00:51:40 Every single movie it kind of puts it kind of puts the list up on a pedestal, right?
00:51:45 Like even if you don't agree with this, it's an interesting idea
00:51:49 But kind of crazy
00:51:51 Yeah, I kind of wanted to do the same thing for like
00:51:54 um
00:51:55 Like playing all of the games from a certain year or at least all of the ones from a certain year that I own already because I
00:52:01 That's too many games come out every year for that to even happen
00:52:05 Like the idea of it's less like I could I could do that like I play every game that I owned that was released before I was born
00:52:12 That could be a fun project
00:52:14 Yeah, that's cool. Just just something's like
00:52:17 It's like pointless. It's pointless and it doesn't mean anything because it's only
00:52:21 It's only for me to like check boxes and like I just is autistic
00:52:26 Well, if it makes you feel just you just described all human endeavor. Oh, no
00:52:31 It makes you feel good. Yeah, that's not that pointless
00:52:34 Do you do you like um, do you like the completionist? I say pointless to like I say pointless to like
00:52:39 um
00:52:40 To distance myself from from it so that I don't have to admit to anything. Yeah. Yeah, like so I don't have to admit to liking something
00:52:49 But yes, it's not like uh, like the um, what's his name? Gerard something the completionist Gerard
00:52:56 Khalil the completionist eyes. I have watched some of his videos
00:53:01 and I
00:53:03 just
00:53:04 I think there was something about him
00:53:06 He's very standard like game reviewer, you know, he he was his gimmick of completing a game 100%
00:53:15 I I've always felt like it wasn't
00:53:19 It was sort of false advertising. Yeah more of a marketing gimmick than it is an actual thing
00:53:23 He does because like technically completes the game
00:53:26 But what he says is basically a simple review about what is the game and what how it's good or bad
00:53:33 And he you know, it's just very standard. I wanted him to go into like how difficult it is to to complete the things
00:53:41 I don't know. It feels like he doesn't go into his gimmick enough like he he leans too closely into
00:53:47 like the standard game reviewer instead of being like
00:53:52 Like he I think he has like his own last I watched him anyway, which is a long time ago
00:53:56 He had this like his own this own like section just devoted to the completionist part
00:54:01 But then but that's like only a piece of the video the rest of the video is just a review and I think I think a channel
00:54:08 That uh that leans more into that completionist gimmick. It might not be as popular, but I think it's more compelling
00:54:15 It probably just does it for the marketing purposes. Yeah, yeah
00:54:19 Like an interesting gimmick
00:54:20 He seems like a cool guy like um, I remember a few years ago
00:54:24 like he used to have a partner that worked on videos with him and uh his partner like left
00:54:30 And he also like when he left he was like, yeah, you need to take down all of the videos I was in
00:54:36 Uh, because I don't want them on the channel anymore
00:54:38 And he was like and he like complied even though he really didn't have to because that's like that's such a stupid request to make
00:54:45 But like uh, I think his name was uh, was it greg?
00:54:48 Yeah, greg that was his name
00:54:51 It yeah, I heard about that. It was uh, kind of like another jauntron situation
00:54:56 It kind of was
00:54:58 And I might be misremembering things because this was a long time ago and I'm not like a huge completionist head
00:55:03 But uh, but that's at least it wasn't at least it wasn't a ronnie from uh game game theories situation
00:55:09 I don't even know who that is. I only know the guy who killed himself. Oh fuck. Okay
00:55:14 The original editor of game theory who killed himself. Yeah, my god
00:55:18 And he was and he was the guy who made um, oh he had his own series on the channel
00:55:23 uh
00:55:25 Side quest digressing and side questing
00:55:28 Uh, I never never knew about that one. You know, what was kind of sad about um
00:55:33 From my perspective any anyways what we said about uh, greg leaving the completionist is that
00:55:39 There weren't very many comments being sad about it. Most of them actually were like, uh, good. I'm glad he's gone
00:55:47 That's kind of why that's always kind of awkward. Why would they be glad he's gone because uh for some reason
00:55:53 It seems like um, a lot of the comments didn't like greg even when he was on the show and they were constantly complaining about him
00:56:00 Uh, so when he left a lot of people. Oh, so he was so he was kind of he was kind of the ben saint of the whole
00:56:05 Yeah, basically
00:56:07 Did he did he leave in in a huff or was it something else? Yeah, he left in a huff. There was a problem
00:56:13 He actually like I don't know the details of what happened, but uh, I think he was upset. He wasn't being paid enough or something
00:56:21 I'm not sure
00:56:23 Yeah, again, I I I'm I don't know the details exactly
00:56:27 but uh
00:56:28 It's just a kind of situation and gerard really came out of it looking like the the bigger man
00:56:34 Yeah, but it's still kind of I still kind of feel bad for him because uh, you know
00:56:38 When john left when john left game grumps, everybody was really sad that he left
00:56:43 But when when this guy left the completionist, it seems like nobody cared or nobody was sad about it
00:56:49 That is kind of sad
00:56:52 Yeah
00:56:53 So the fact that nobody was sad actually kind of makes me sad about it
00:56:58 That just means yeah, I want you to be gamers tavern
00:57:01 Yeah
00:57:02 Oh, there's this guy more men like you this one guy
00:57:06 Similar to the completion. Well, not really similar to the completionist that I watched. Um called lord cat
00:57:12 Oh, yeah, okay. Wait, wait, wait
00:57:15 Okay, I know lord cat only from I had a chance the down the rabbit hole
00:57:21 About a spoonie. That's the only thing I know about it. I haven't watched that video
00:57:25 But he's he's a that guy with a glasses person
00:57:28 I don't know much about him personally, but his review show that he had was got a small dick and you're fucking afraid of it
00:57:37 Yeah, epic, um, I was gonna show
00:57:41 His show was called uh until we win
00:57:44 And it was strangely compelling. I don't think he was very popular
00:57:48 um
00:57:49 but his videos were like
00:57:52 He takes a really difficult game like battle toads or something some old nes game and he details
00:57:59 his his like
00:58:01 Struggle and strategy and eventual overcoming of obstacles to complete the nes game
00:58:07 No matter how difficult it is and we're gonna play it until we win and then like rock music plays
00:58:13 That's uh game center. That is kind of like game center. Yeah, it's basically the same idea. It's it's a good premise
00:58:20 Um, I I enjoyed that because it's a good premise if you're bad at games
00:58:25 Yeah, well, he was quite good at games as far as if you're a pro gamer then like what's even there's no there then that's like no gimmick at all
00:58:31 Like of course you'll win
00:58:33 The thing is that he would play like games that would stump other people and be like
00:58:38 Like like really annoying and no one would ever go through getting through this like pumpkin head
00:58:44 I think he played which is like this early pc or
00:58:47 or something 3d game that was
00:58:51 Had you know like a lot asked of the player in order to complete it, but he did it and it was like that's cool
00:58:57 That's what I wanted out of the completionist more of that sort of that hype moment, but it was very
00:59:02 Sort of clinical and uninteresting kind of milk test
00:59:06 Yeah, I think I think one of the reasons why false advertising
00:59:11 Yeah, I think one of the reasons why lord cat never really got that big is because like
00:59:18 He he has a break his personality is like really abrasive and you can tell just from like watching him for a short while
00:59:24 But it's not like it's not abrasive in like an endearing way like spoonies was
00:59:29 Mmm, we're like spoonie spoonie is like abrasive, but he's also pretty funny too
00:59:35 And so you can kind of like you can kind of like take it in stride, but like lord cat is
00:59:40 Lord cat almost feels like too mean in a way
00:59:44 Lord cat's a brute spoonie is like a witty witty snark. Yeah, he's like
00:59:49 Spoonie is he's like a loser. You're a loser
00:59:54 I'm sorry, that's the only that's that it's it's funny that you describe him as like being aggressive because the one thing
01:00:00 That I've ever heard of him is he's like on his furious rant about how much he hates spoonie. You and that idiot Joe
01:00:08 That's a coincidence
01:00:11 Uh
01:00:12 It's good stuff. Did just the ancient lore behind all that stuff
01:00:17 Mm-hmm
01:00:22 Uh, what I guess is that it is that all we have to say about uh, what are we even talking about?
01:00:29 Uh, has anyone heard of the piss the pissed off video gamer? Does anybody know that guy? That's just sounds like
01:00:38 It's very generic. I think that might not is that a real person. Let me let me check
01:00:42 It's it's this incredibly obese guy that was like clearly inspired by the angry video game nerd
01:00:46 I think I've heard of this
01:00:48 And he is uh
01:00:51 I thought you were joking. I know the irate gamer
01:00:54 He's worse
01:00:56 Wow
01:00:57 Wait pissed off gamer is worse than the irate gamer. Yes. It's it's more of like a lol cow situation that it is like a
01:01:04 content creator
01:01:06 I think I think I've heard of this guy
01:01:09 I just always assume with stuff like this that that he's like
01:01:13 That it's like supposed supposed to be satire. Maybe that's
01:01:17 Maybe that's just me like protecting myself
01:01:20 but uh, maybe um
01:01:22 The thing with this guy, it's he's just kind of funny
01:01:26 um
01:01:28 He's made this this this this video about the the nintendo shitcruel
01:01:34 and uh
01:01:36 He's he basically
01:01:39 I don't want to be too mean
01:01:40 But he's breathing heavily and he clearly doesn't know how to speak very well
01:01:45 And the whole review is just him sort of like saying
01:01:49 the nintendo
01:01:51 shitcube
01:01:53 is
01:01:54 Not good
01:01:55 It sounds pretty sounds pretty good
01:01:58 It's it sounds like me. I I kind of love it. I kind of love listening to him
01:02:03 It kind of reminds me of uh francis trying to do like a bit
01:02:07 But it's it's hard to tell what is a bit and what is him
01:02:11 because I mean
01:02:13 He's not in the best way
01:02:15 Reminds me of uh, which is named boogie when he used to do those francis things. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but like actual
01:02:21 I think he still does that
01:02:23 Oh my god
01:02:25 Is this real is this real this guy? I think he is yes
01:02:30 Is this is being serious? Okay
01:02:33 This isn't even like that early
01:02:35 This looks like it would be from like 2007. Well, this is a real
01:02:39 This is a real. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So so like if it's that early on I'd
01:02:45 Not to say that satire wasn't invented until like 2010 or anything
01:02:49 But I I think back then there were a lot more people like genuinely trying stuff like this
01:02:54 Yeah, you should know that uh
01:02:57 Maddox invented satire in 97
01:03:01 Oh true true. I forgot about that. Did he I forgot. So I guess did he say that or something?
01:03:08 Yeah
01:03:09 This was him actually
01:03:11 Wow, you know, he lost a lot of weight and uh, yeah, good for him
01:03:19 I'm just what oh god. Oh god. Oh no, this is depressing
01:03:24 On the reason I call it the nintendo shit cube
01:03:29 is
01:03:30 That is a piece of fucking shit
01:03:36 It's pretty good
01:03:40 He's telling like it
01:03:42 You should just make like a like a parody of this video
01:03:47 No, no
01:03:49 I can't do it. Not nearly as good as other people. Well, first you have to get really fat
01:03:54 I I yeah, I gotta pack on the pounds. I just buy a fat suit
01:03:58 Commit no, no, no, you gotta be you gotta be uh authentic
01:04:03 Method act as the pissed off video that's called production value
01:04:07 I gotta get a really shitty camera. I gotta get a terrible mic
01:04:10 Hmm
01:04:12 The scour the all of it daniel dameron. I gotta I gotta paint stakingly recreate his room as it appears
01:04:20 Well, I mean you are saying that you cleaned your room so and his room's pretty clean looking
01:04:26 So you're already you already got that down
01:04:29 Yeah, his room is not too bad. I can't even understand. I've never come to think of it
01:04:34 I've never seen game give and pissed off video gamer in the same place at the same time true true
01:04:41 I think we're I think we're on to you really makes you think
01:04:45 Um, well, I mean, where is your proof, huh? Where is your proof?
01:04:51 Burden the proof lies on you slams desk objection evidence, please
01:04:55 No, you need to proof read your proof
01:04:58 No, you she can't do it. She can't defend herself. She's got nothing looks like we want this argument then
01:05:04 Going for the kill
01:05:07 Stop killing me
01:05:10 You would like that wouldn't you
01:05:12 I would I would like it if you stop killing me stabs
01:05:16 No, this is worse than
01:05:18 Being in hell. This is terrible. Oh, you want me to stop executing you sounds like someone who's guilty
01:05:25 guilty would say
01:05:27 You've walked right into our trap
01:05:30 You've walked right into our life is a cage and death is the key
01:05:35 Ah, that's a good one. Would you find that one? Would you come up with it yourself?
01:05:41 I think I got it from a real cool person
01:05:45 Wow
01:05:50 Hey, hey, hey gibb. Yeah, fuck you. Okay. Fuck you. I'll get right on that
01:05:57 No, fuck your whole country. I mean, yeah, sure. All right. Piece of shit. Uh, uh, vat tax
01:06:03 Uh, uh, it's bullshit. Oh, yeah, that is I hate it so much. It's it's so shit. Let me just let me just complain about this
01:06:11 So I get done I get done sending out all the rfck kickstarter stuff and
01:06:17 and it turns out and in in
01:06:20 You alerted me of it and I guess this is just a uk thing and maybe there were some other countries to do it too
01:06:24 but because of the vat the import vat tax it costs
01:06:29 so much
01:06:31 to just fucking
01:06:33 For you I already paid the postage to send the package to you and it just cost you like
01:06:38 60 fucking dollars just to merely accept it to just have it be delivered to you even though it's already there
01:06:46 And um, I don't I don't really understand
01:06:49 Why I don't get it and I'm and I'm pissed off because I already charged a
01:06:54 I already charged a small like shipping fee for anyone outside the country
01:06:58 So I said to everyone in rfck like if you have to pay this I will cover it
01:07:03 I will cover it out of the the funds because I don't I already charge you for shipping
01:07:07 Uh, uh, the other one
01:07:11 Kola the one that made the the biggest order she got it's it's it's gonna be it's like a hundred and it's like a hundred and fifty dollars
01:07:20 Or it's like over a hundred fucking dollars just for her to like accept her fucking package
01:07:25 And I'm so fucking pissed at the government
01:07:28 Fuck the government. I'll agree. So wait was the
01:07:32 the um
01:07:33 How much was my pin amount like because I think it was because of how you've you you labeled the
01:07:41 Value of the items and they say oh, yeah trading valuable goods. That's we're gonna have to
01:07:46 Take money from you for that
01:07:48 You're I don't remember like
01:07:51 I think your pledge was like 70 bucks or something. Yeah, and so I don't remember I don't remember like how much
01:07:58 was uh like look I get to the post office thinking that I'm just gonna send these packages and they're like
01:08:04 No, no, you have to fill out a form you have to fill out a customs form and I'm like uh
01:08:08 Okay, and I'm in line and there's people waiting behind me
01:08:12 And they're like they're looking at me and like I'm holding them up and like I'm I'm sweating
01:08:15 Like I'm actually like sweating standing there
01:08:17 I'm just like frantically trying to fill these customs forms out to just get my shit sent in the mail
01:08:22 I I don't even remember what I put for the value. I probably just like put like
01:08:27 It just probably just picked a random fucking number and put it down there
01:08:31 Uh, uh, and um, maybe I put like a hundred dollars or something
01:08:35 And probably you should have put one dollar
01:08:38 I I should have yeah, I should have
01:08:41 Because like I thought that putting a higher value would maybe like ensure the package for more
01:08:47 And I thought that that would be covered by postage, but it's not it's just it literally the quest there
01:08:52 I'm them asking for the value is literally just like how much should we fucking
01:08:56 How how much should we extort out of the person you're sending this to because you're sending it to them?
01:09:01 But I didn't know I didn't know that's why they were asking or I would have undervalued
01:09:05 I think I probably overvalued it and I don't know it's gonna cost me a
01:09:09 It's gonna cost me an arm and a leg, but whatever
01:09:11 Live and learn I guess
01:09:13 Piece of shit never be on never tell the government the truth. That's what I've learned preach
01:09:17 Uh, uh, they will they will use it. They will use the truth against you
01:09:22 Oh, speaking of the government. I gotta do my taxes soon. I keep thinking about it. Oh, yeah
01:09:27 Keep thinking about that old document thing. Really? You have to do your taxes at the end of the year
01:09:33 We have like four months to do them. Well, they said you got until the end of january
01:09:37 But you may as well do it now. So I'm like, yeah, I guess I may as well do it now
01:09:42 You haven't done April
01:09:44 I still haven't paid my taxes from last year
01:09:47 Because they were due in april, but I got an extension to october
01:09:51 didn't ever and then you
01:09:54 Uh, I had to apply for it, but it was like very easy to apply. I literally just like clicked a button and they were like, yeah, you've been approved
01:10:01 Um, no, there was everyone got an extension till like june or something right?
01:10:05 That was like a further extension that I that I applied for till october. That's interesting. I think for for me
01:10:11 They said, yeah, you don't have to pay taxes for
01:10:15 2020
01:10:16 We just like you're off the hook give just you no no not not for 20
01:10:20 Well, those are no those are my 2019 taxes
01:10:22 Whatever the the one that like they're saying you just
01:10:26 For the for the tax year of something to something you don't have to pay that one
01:10:29 But you do need to pay this next one. So I'm like, was that because of like a covid relief? I I'm pretty sure it was
01:10:33 Yeah, god fucking dammit. Why is america so shit?
01:10:36 Why is america such fucking dog shit? Holy fuck
01:10:40 God damn. I have to pay like 2000 fucking dollars in taxes for 2019. It's a nightmare. I get money Jesus cry
01:10:47 I love doing my taxes
01:10:49 Oh my god, but that's because I love doing when you think of your self-employed taxes are the worst fucking thing in the world
01:10:55 I think when you're self-employed you get screwed in taxes more
01:10:58 Yeah, it's it's so bad. It's so bad
01:11:01 I like doing my taxes when it turns out that I don't have to pay them. It's like I can write everything off
01:11:06 Oh, that's nice. Love to say it. Taxes are very taxing
01:11:11 That's why they call them that
01:11:13 It's true. I have to pay
01:11:16 I have to pay I had to pay a ton. I had to pay a ton in taxes. I'm hoping
01:11:20 I'm gonna claim like so many deductions. I'm gonna claim like every fucking deduction from
01:11:26 The all these kick starters and stuff. I don't know. I'm hoping to have a lot to write off
01:11:30 I think uh, I don't know uh too much about this
01:11:33 But I think in order to get around this issue when you're self-employed is to start an LLC
01:11:40 I don't oh god, haven't you all talked about making the pcp in LLC?
01:11:46 Like a while. Yeah
01:11:48 Yeah, somebody floats the idea every once in a while or they or they used to back before uh back before
01:11:53 Back before everyone just left. I feel like I'm just left for no reason. I feel like the only person who would have done it
01:11:57 Uh, hasn't been on the podcast in five months. So
01:12:01 Um
01:12:02 Nate would bring it up. I think Tom would bring it up or something. Yeah, yeah
01:12:06 Yeah, did you mentioned it once or twice and but like but none of us knew how to do it
01:12:11 Um, so it cares to learn because it was like
01:12:14 I gotta
01:12:15 The idea would come up
01:12:16 One of us would be like, you know, that might be a good idea
01:12:20 And then that would be like it. It was it was mostly just the idea of like
01:12:24 Oh, if we're all gonna like move into the same area to do making videos and all that funny stuff that will never happen anymore
01:12:31 maybe um
01:12:33 Then uh, it would be handy and very
01:12:37 much
01:12:38 Like smooth the process over of like me coming to america if it was an LLC that could hire me on
01:12:44 Yeah, you'd get a work visa rather than me having to like get an immigration something or other
01:12:48 There's a there's another podcast that I used to listen to years ago that had that had a similar plan
01:12:54 Uh to get someone from australia over to california on like work visa
01:13:00 Was it game grumps? No. No, it was I um, it was like a I thought it might have been ross
01:13:06 Also, none of them did do that. Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't yatsi
01:13:09 I'm I'm I'm convinced have I have I said my conspiracy theory that ross and holly's marriage was just a green card scam
01:13:15 I think you have back when like the pro-jaret stuff
01:13:19 Yeah, I think I heard you say that was holly canadian
01:13:23 Is
01:13:24 Is ross canady sounds a little bit
01:13:26 I don't wait
01:13:28 Did holly no holly lived in like
01:13:31 Portland
01:13:32 Ross I think and ross was living in america. So no no the holly was american
01:13:36 Can you like stay in the u.s. If you are on like green card if you divorce your
01:13:43 american husband or wife?
01:13:46 I'm not I think if you've been here long
01:13:48 I think if you've been here long enough you can probably
01:13:51 Apply for like citizenship to something. I don't I'm maybe I don't fucking know
01:13:57 Maybe there's like a timer
01:13:59 Clearly it's possible to do something like that because people appear
01:14:03 And they stay people up here. Well, I think uh in order to apply for citizenship
01:14:08 You have to have been living in the country for a certain amount of years, but I'm not sure how many years
01:14:13 Yeah, yeah, that's that's what I mean like if if he had been here with holly for long enough that would even if they got divorced that might
01:14:20 Might make it possible. I don't know. I don't know how it works
01:14:23 seems plausible
01:14:26 But the u.s. Is one of the easiest place to get a citizenship and as far as I know
01:14:32 Wait, what that can't be true
01:14:35 Um, I know the test it's the test you take is apparently really really easy
01:14:42 Like it's just like when was america founded?
01:14:45 Who is the first president?
01:14:48 What colors are on the flag and stuff like that? I when was america founded? Oh july 4th
01:14:56 Uh, um 1997 when maddox invented satire. He created the united states
01:15:02 Yeah, exactly as a joke as a bit
01:15:08 He did both sides of the war. Yeah, that's centrist maddox
01:15:13 I remember the the the bit from that episode of the simpsons where up who is applying for citizenship and the they ask him like
01:15:21 Why what was the civil war fought over and he gives like a very like nuance like detailed answer and the guy's just like
01:15:28 Please just say slavery
01:15:33 It makes it a lot easier
01:15:40 It's possible that uh citizenship in us has gotten harder now or maybe easier. I'm not sure but
01:15:46 I can't imagine why
01:15:47 It's not
01:15:49 Yeah
01:15:50 It's I mean it's not easy because you know, it's a whole fucking it's a whole fucking thing
01:15:55 There's like a million fucking people that want to come here and get citizenship
01:15:58 But can't and there's a million fucking people. I didn't say it was easy here on expired green cars that uh
01:16:03 That it's easier than in most other countries because a lot of other countries are really difficult to um
01:16:09 Immigrate to I don't I've I've heard that japan is particularly difficult to get into like to stay forever
01:16:17 There might be some countries where it's harder
01:16:20 But like at the uk is quite difficult as well
01:16:24 Commenters, please don't take this discussion too seriously. We're not informed. Yeah, we're just don't go right
01:16:29 I don't I don't take all of us what we're saying and then like repeat it and then assume that
01:16:35 I look at this like what ben said in this episode. He really needs to stop running his mouth about things. He doesn't understand
01:16:41 I I know I need to do more of that if anything I need to be bolder with my stupid opinions could be wrong
01:16:51 No, you couldn't be wrong. It's impossible. No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't say that you can't yeah on the pot on the pcp
01:16:57 We're never on the pcp. You fake it till you make it true. You say it's it does make sense
01:17:02 Uh, that the country just say that's what the pcps model does make sense for the countries to have uh,
01:17:08 A lot of social programs to have tighter immigration laws
01:17:12 Oh, social programs don't have this
01:17:15 Well, I mean countries to have like yeah, so I guess it should be easy
01:17:19 That was a joke. Yeah, I'm joking
01:17:22 Yeah, yeah, um, yeah, Japan
01:17:25 I think they just don't like non-jeffins
01:17:29 Yeah, and I mean who can blame them. Yeah, like they want people to come in like they want to like dilute the manga industry with like
01:17:37 The wrong types of drawers
01:17:39 The wrong types of cartoonists. We've we've all seen what happens when white people take over so
01:17:46 You don't want that shit if you're a japanese older brother broke his knees. Do you still call him nishan?
01:17:56 Wouldn't it be nishan?
01:17:58 Yeah, it was nishan. Uh, oh, they said sorry. Sorry
01:18:02 He's he's nishan nishan. It's like you like the car car. Yeah
01:18:07 Oh, exactly. This is all coming together. I'm gonna go pick up my nishan in my nishan from the airport
01:18:16 Excuse me
01:18:18 I'm loving this
01:18:20 How you're excused about
01:18:22 How about ebay?
01:18:24 You guys ebay. How about it?
01:18:26 You guys been on ebay lately? I've never been uh
01:18:30 Never actually ebay is where I uh, I don't really look at it before amazon ebay was the place to go to get things on the internet
01:18:36 I remember way back. I saw a lot of stuff on ebay, uh, like my entire gaming collection
01:18:42 I
01:18:44 I was because my my my tablet broke actually yeah, my tablet broke
01:18:47 I mentioned this before and so I needed to get a new one and I was looking for it on amazon
01:18:52 And it's like a thousand fucking dollars on amazon, but like this is an old-ass model
01:18:57 So it should not be that much
01:18:59 So I went on ebay and I found it
01:19:01 And I and I did I had not done this for years, but I I I haggled I fucking haggled
01:19:08 And you know what I came out on top like a month ago a month ago
01:19:11 I went on ebay and I made and I found a an item for sale and I was like that's a little too much
01:19:18 I think I can squeeze more out of you. They were asking 175 plus 65 dollar shipping for this tablet
01:19:23 And I was like, hmm. Fuck you. So I I I so I made an offer
01:19:28 I didn't I did I've never used this feature on ebay before I made an offer for like 125 dollars and they were like
01:19:35 No, they they made a counter offer that was like 165. They're like, oh, I'll shave a little like no
01:19:39 I'll fuck you. Fuck you. So I made a counter counter offer
01:19:42 Okay 135 and they just flat rejected it. They didn't even make a counter offer and I'm like, oh, no
01:19:48 I've lost it too hard to get
01:19:51 Well for the at the time I go back on yesterday the item is still there
01:19:56 It's been up for a month. This person is fucked. This person is in dire straits. They're desperate. I can use this
01:20:02 I have the leverage now. I have the upper hand. So I make another reply
01:20:07 145 dollars. Bam approved. Got it. Shave $30. It's a clean $35 off of the asking price. Hope to see it. Fuck
01:20:15 Fuck you, uh
01:20:17 Whatever you need. I haven't um, I haven't used ebay much to buy stuff
01:20:21 But I use it a lot to sell things and it's a pretty good way to sell your games way better than game stop
01:20:27 I guess I'll have to sell my current tablet um
01:20:31 As is for parts and probably get like 50 bucks for it probably literally pay more to ship it than I would even get for it
01:20:38 It's like a cintiq, isn't it?
01:20:40 It is it is
01:20:43 It's the it's the oldest model. It's literally the oldest model. What's wrong with it again?
01:20:48 It uh, as far as I can tell the only thing that's wrong with it is that the screen simply doesn't work. Oh, uh, which is pretty bad
01:20:56 Hypothetically if you could fix the the display it still works fine
01:21:01 Like it's still like like receives input and like knows when you are like, you know moving the cursor on it and stuff
01:21:08 Uh, it's just the screen doesn't show anything. Um, so if you could fix that then
01:21:13 It would work, but like it's such an old model that the the Wacom doesn't, um
01:21:18 Uh, service the model anymore, and I think it would probably take
01:21:22 Because it's so old. I think it would probably cost more to repair than it would just to fucking replace the thing. Yeah
01:21:27 um, yeah, so yeah
01:21:30 Uh, it's probably just fucking good go in the trash. Oh, no, whenever I uh, I couldn't bear to put it in the trash
01:21:36 It would just feel whenever I sell stuff on ebay. I don't like shipping to anywhere outside of the us
01:21:42 So I avoid yeah, because they've send it to fucking uk
01:21:45 You send it to the uk and they put a fucking vat tax on it and it cost them 100 fucking dollars to receive the package
01:21:51 Hey, fuck you andrew yang with your vat tax. Uh, you be I terrible idea never gonna do it
01:21:57 Can't believe I buy I own a shirt with your name on it. Uh, uh, it's a it's a mistake
01:22:01 It was all a mistake. I gotta say it's it was really funny seeing how fast you turned on andrew yang
01:22:08 Back went back like before the uh
01:22:11 Before like the primaries or whatever because there was like a solid I want to say like a solid couple
01:22:16 Maybe like two months
01:22:17 Or where where you were you know, it was two months. I think and then I think bernie started running you were like, all right
01:22:22 Never mind. This is this is just a bit. I was just kidding guys
01:22:25 I owe I owe yang I owe yang a lot when when when yang started running and I heard about the ubi thing
01:22:31 I was like, wait, what I don't know
01:22:34 Just like that that whole idea and having it be like seriously proposed like really got me thinking about like wait a minute
01:22:41 Hmm public policy can like impact people in like a material way
01:22:47 Huh, and it just got me thinking like more seriously about
01:22:52 About issues man public policy
01:22:55 That's weird
01:22:57 Hmm. It's like it's almost like it's almost like uh, uh, uh, you know material conditions like affect society
01:23:04 He got you on the on the public policy pipeline
01:23:08 He did the ppp. He did he
01:23:11 He got me on the um
01:23:13 What's the like marxist thing like materialism like dialectical materialism. Yeah, he pipelined me to dialectical materialism
01:23:20 And it was fucking based
01:23:23 Thanks, andrew
01:23:24 Thanks, andre yang. Thanks. Yang is thanks, andre yang
01:23:28 Should get him on the podcast sometime. Oh, that would be fucking fine. Please get andre yang. Thanks yang
01:23:34 fang
01:23:35 Um, we should get Biden on the podcast and see if he dies mid mid show
01:23:39 Could you imagine dude imagine if we were the podcast where he fucking died?
01:23:49 He'd drop a lot of experience points, I think yeah, I mean that'd be huge for the channel
01:23:54 Uh, like he's very high level with a little minecraft experience orbs. We suck them up
01:23:59 You didn't know a lot of levels with that the pcp's xb bar. We're just fucking go skyrocketing for like eight levels
01:24:06 It would be it would literally be like when like your level five badoof gets the last like quick quick attack on on a
01:24:13 Rayquaza or something and it's just like
01:24:17 Uh, that that's that was secretly the best the best inclusion to pokemon was uh was having a little experience bar at the bottom
01:24:26 It it's good
01:24:28 It's so much it's so much more satisfying
01:24:31 What do they add that like gen two? Yeah, that was gen two. I think
01:24:35 Okay, now I'm just thinking
01:24:39 Like the idea the concept that all people have more experience. So it's more worth it to kill them
01:24:44 Well, yeah, they're like level 80
01:24:46 They're high. Yeah, they're higher level
01:24:49 And also also biden's and like uh and specced into a high class. So that just adds even more experience
01:24:57 He's he's a prestige class true. Yeah
01:25:00 He's um, he's got uh, he's he's like uh, he's like a legendary like raid boss, you know, he's like a he's like a higher level instance
01:25:11 Uh or something
01:25:14 So he's a he's a unique mob
01:25:17 So it's got like a gold
01:25:19 Oh, no, yes silver dragon silver fox thing round his icon not not the word I would use to describe joe biden, but
01:25:27 Uh, you know, come on. I mean, come on. He's he's got that he's got the animal magnetism
01:25:33 You know, he's got that there's something about him. You think he's a furry
01:25:37 What he's just got that gen s a qua. He's just got he's just such a
01:25:42 You know, like we said on shredded, you know, he's he's such a he's a he's you can look at him and you can tell he's a cake eater
01:25:49 What the fuck does that mean? Yeah, what the fuck?
01:25:52 That's a weird thing to say
01:25:54 This is a thing on on the on the shredded episode we tried to decode they they kept talking about people being cake eaters
01:26:01 And i'm pretty sure it just means like someone who
01:26:05 Enjoys life but more specifically in the context of r slash adultery
01:26:09 It means someone who has their cake and eats it too i.e.
01:26:13 Is just like fucking live in the high life fucking their spouse, but also their their af or adultery partner
01:26:20 Or sorry a fair partner. Sorry. Would it be ap? Um
01:26:24 Seems like uh, that that subreddit really had an effect on you
01:26:29 Um, it was very funny. It was very that's how it starts. I may be angry starts out funny
01:26:34 Then I get serious
01:26:37 Uh, I it's I'll have to do a lecture. I'll have to do a lecture on um on the uh r slash adultery lore
01:26:44 Uh, the thing about like they talk about like there's code
01:26:48 Where like oh
01:26:49 Yeah, I was walking around in the parking lot with an upside down pineapple in my shopping cart
01:26:54 And everyone knows like that's a secret sign that i'm like on the prowl for an elicit
01:26:59 extra marital
01:27:01 Freemasons pizza gate emails came out or all these like all these like politicians of talking about getting like
01:27:08 Spaghetti with extra sauce and cheese pizza like what what is what this like weird coded language?
01:27:14 Mmm. Mmm. I mean wait was that pizza stuff like I have I was that I have no clue
01:27:20 I have no clue. Okay. I'm I'm I'm not one of those people who like thinks that there's
01:27:28 Like I mean, I believe that there was
01:27:30 I don't believe in the I don't believe in the satanic pedophile ring. I mean, well, I do
01:27:35 I don't believe that it just is like only the democrat. Yeah, I'm sure they're all fucking kids
01:27:40 They're all they're all fucking kids and drinking blood. Yeah, obviously. Yeah, it's like eyes wide shut
01:27:44 That's why they had the kill. That's why they had to kill uh, uh, Kubrick
01:27:49 I thought you were gonna say epstein, but yeah, well that too
01:27:53 Yeah, I've never seen eyes wide shut. Um, but I can use my context clues to infer
01:27:58 What it's about that it is a movie. Yeah, it's it's it's a little flick. It's got tom cruise in it. Yeah
01:28:04 Oh, I'll have to check that. Yeah, I know how much you love tom cruise
01:28:08 I I am a notorious your notorious tom cruise appreciate your real cruiser
01:28:15 That's as we like to call them cruising for as we call it on r slash the cruise
01:28:29 Fuck what are we talking about tom cruise something. Oh, yeah, love them
01:28:35 Okay, what else
01:28:38 Um, uh, I don't know. I think
01:28:41 Uh, I guess I tweeted about it's similar sort of like list making stuff, but I've been seeing a lot of simpsons
01:28:49 Classic simpsons clips on youtube recommended and I've got into a big old thing just clicking on those and being like ha ha
01:28:55 I remember that bit. That was funny. Hmm. And then uh idea popped into my head like
01:29:00 I've always wondered like
01:29:02 How when the simpsons gets bad? How does it get bad and how quickly and I was like
01:29:08 What if I watched every episode of the simpsons and I I
01:29:13 Noted every time there was a joke with a punchline
01:29:16 That it was like a joke that was good or a joke that didn't land and then I went through every single episode in that way
01:29:23 You mentioned this graphing thing before but when you say it like that it's like
01:29:26 Oh, you're trying to like see exactly when the downfall was
01:29:30 Yeah
01:29:31 Oh
01:29:33 Well, I mean, this is a this is a great question
01:29:36 Uh, uh, I mean the the general consent it seems like the the
01:29:41 The general community consensus is that the decline happens somewhere around season 10
01:29:49 Nine nine or ten
01:29:50 But there are some hardliners that say that actually the golden era was like season up to season three
01:29:55 And the decline actually started after that and was only like fully completed around season. Well, I remember the the first time
01:30:02 I hated watching the simpsons was in uh the year 2000
01:30:07 I watched one of the new episodes that aired from the new season on sunday
01:30:11 And I I didn't like it at all and I stopped watching after that
01:30:16 2000 would have been like season 20
01:30:20 No season eight
01:30:22 Season 12 something like that. Yeah
01:30:25 Which would be like
01:30:26 post peak simpsons, but not like not like late simpsons. Exactly. It would be like middle air
01:30:32 I I I remember I think I've talked about this before in the show
01:30:35 I have heard that it I have heard that it got bad that it got worse before eventually kind of getting less bad
01:30:42 In like the late later seasons. That's what I've heard some people. Yeah, I've seen a few things like that
01:30:46 um, but I remember
01:30:48 Rewatching the simpsons up to like season 12 or 15 or something and I still
01:30:53 Was enjoying myself. I don't think it was like
01:30:56 The later ones were like as good and I can tell there was like a little bit of difference
01:31:00 but it didn't like
01:31:02 Piss me off as I was expecting some of the episodes to like just just based on hearsay like, uh, you'll hate this one
01:31:08 I'm like, oh god. I don't want to I don't want to hate anything and I didn't so I was like
01:31:14 um
01:31:15 Yeah, I kind of want to go all through through all of them instead of like stopping
01:31:21 I think it's so much to do. I think it's a really funny gimmick to have like
01:31:26 um to have like this
01:31:28 what what sort of
01:31:30 You might call like a scientific like beta driven approach to to it. I think that's funny is
01:31:38 Which like scientist man discusses like terminator or something
01:31:43 I'm trying to yeah, yeah, but like but but to have like a consistent like rule set that you were abiding by as you go through
01:31:51 Yeah, I think it's funny. Yeah, it's funny because it's like there's no way I could like
01:31:57 Prove that a joke landed based. It's just whether I liked it or not whether it was a good joke to me
01:32:03 Yeah, that does sound pretty cool. I hope somebody does that to my stuff someday. I think a challenge there would be like
01:32:09 Even like counting jokes at all because like Simpsons will have I know
01:32:14 Jokes that like like jokes within jokes
01:32:16 So like like a punchline comes and then another punchline comes that you didn't expect and then another one
01:32:21 It's like, oh, that's such a clever little writing thing
01:32:23 You think it's gonna happen this way and then it doesn't and then something else happens and it's like if
01:32:27 If you're pausing like every time there's a joke to evaluate like did that land or didn't it?
01:32:33 You're gonna be like making a lot of fucking notes. I know it's such a stupid idea
01:32:38 And I just couldn't I just like
01:32:41 Part of me wants to maybe you can practice on my stuff first before you move on to the simpsons
01:32:47 Yeah, I could those are very clear jokes. Oh
01:32:50 For a while
01:32:52 Oh fuck for a while. I was listening to
01:32:55 I think it's called worst episode ever the simpsons podcast
01:32:59 And I I fell off listening to it and I don't remember why
01:33:03 It must have been the worst podcast ever
01:33:06 Um, have
01:33:08 Have any of you read?
01:33:11 um
01:33:12 The dead homer
01:33:14 Have you ever read like ever
01:33:18 Just memorable remember
01:33:20 All right. Well, well to give a basic rundown reading is like when you look at these things called words and um
01:33:26 And there's a collection of words on this website called the dead homer society
01:33:31 And they've heard of this. I've heard there's there's like a section
01:33:36 On the website called like zombie simpsons and it basically is like it's like a novel explaining
01:33:42 Like when the downfall of the simpsons happened. It sounds a lot like Gibbs idea
01:33:48 Uh, it's I remember reading it like years ago. It's really good
01:33:52 Wait a minute. We got we got okay. I'm looking at this page. This is exactly. I I think I'm okay
01:33:58 I've seen the dead homer society. I've never seen this specific page, but like
01:34:04 I really like this and I'm definitely going to read it. It looks really interesting
01:34:07 Wait, I'm but it's not okay. Are these like links in the middle are two like chapters. Yes. Yes
01:34:14 Okay, it's okay
01:34:17 Reading but nobody does that anymore like line charts. Well
01:34:21 It has charts where it even even has charts in the first part. I would like to see that's
01:34:27 I like the the okay. I'm looking at the first part is called. There it is. What is zombie simpsons?
01:34:33 Average stars. Okay. They I mean they didn't do it by jokes. No, they're not doing it by jokes
01:34:38 Gibbs is a lot more. Um, is a lot more
01:34:42 I really like this family. It's it's funny
01:34:45 Yeah, it's good. I like it a lot it the the website itself is very like old internet
01:34:51 In a certain way. Yeah, I remember I remember the zombie simpsons thing being a really good read
01:34:57 Especially as someone like myself who like by the time I was like watching like shows like the simpsons
01:35:03 The simpsons was like long since bad. So I don't have like this attachment to the show that a lot of people do
01:35:11 I I've I've grown up with I had the box set of season two
01:35:16 I am exactly as old as the simpsons
01:35:19 Wow, so you're like the perfect age almost that's that's pretty lame then
01:35:24 Wait, what?
01:35:25 It's pretty lame
01:35:26 No, cool. Yeah, no, he's right. It is kind of lame. Nah shut up
01:35:34 Oh, you know those are funny because I I grew up watching the simpsons
01:35:37 I think I didn't realize that like even as I was watching them as a kid
01:35:41 They the episodes I was seeing were already like, you know, five or ten years old
01:35:46 I just kind of watched them and thought they were new, you know for a long time. Yeah, I had the same experience
01:35:53 Yeah
01:35:54 Uh
01:35:55 Same same with like same with the the nes the nes came out the year that I was born
01:35:59 And I didn't get one until I was like five or six
01:36:02 And then like later I got a super nintendo a little later
01:36:06 I didn't realize that by the time I got an nes the super nintendo was already it was already obsolete
01:36:11 But at the time I just I just assumed that it was like new and then like I found out later at the time
01:36:15 I think in the u.s. Uh, the nes came out in 1985. You were born in 85. Wait
01:36:23 When did it come out in america in america? It was 85. Um, wait, am I stupid? I thought it came out in like 80
01:36:31 Uh, the famicom was 83. I think yeah
01:36:35 Oh, okay. Well, I'm well that just makes my point even harder then is that you know, I got
01:36:40 Yeah, it was like almost a decade old when I got it
01:36:42 But I thought it was the new it was new and I just kind of assumed that to be the case until like for a long long time
01:36:48 Yeah, your parents tricked you
01:36:51 They probably I mean they probably didn't have to I'm sure they didn't even have to lie for me to just assume
01:36:56 um
01:36:58 But it was just surprising to be like, oh wait, really? It was that old even then? Holy shit
01:37:04 Weird there was this other thing I was thinking I probably also stopped me if you heard this one before
01:37:09 um
01:37:10 but no uh looking through the simpsons and then adding up
01:37:14 the day night transitions and and like and and and like time passing
01:37:20 moments so that you can accurately say
01:37:23 How old Bart and Lisa actually are in like the canon of the simpsons
01:37:29 Have actually thought about that. I feel like that's something simpsons fans would have done like wait, wait
01:37:35 What's the question? The idea is like the the the show has been going on for a very long time
01:37:40 It's like oh Bart and Lisa wouldn't be that old
01:37:42 But I've always wondered like could you fit like all of the episodes
01:37:48 Into like a smaller amount of time than it's actually elapsed in real life. Like how old would they actually be?
01:37:54 this okay, there is a
01:37:57 I there's a youtuber called the real gyms who does
01:38:02 Simpsons analysis like this and he has some series called
01:38:06 Uh, I think like the simpsons timeline. It's like there's there's one about the past timeline
01:38:12 One about the present timeline and about like and and the future timeline and I think it's in the present one
01:38:18 He talks about it and like I think like yeah, like there's more
01:38:22 There's like like like Bart and Lisa have been 10 and 8 for all this time
01:38:29 But there's more episodes than there are like days in the year
01:38:32 So you would have like for it to work you would have to assume that like certain episodes are like happening concurrently with each other
01:38:39 like on any given day like the plot of the plot of uh, uh
01:38:46 I'm trying to think of an you know the the plot of one episode unfolds sort of in between the
01:38:51 Unfolding and you would have to like cross-reference the characters to make sure that there's no like contradiction
01:38:57 Yeah
01:38:58 There are there are there are contradictions though the funniest thing is that like
01:39:02 Every the simpsons always takes place in the year when Bart is 10 and and Lisa is 8 and yet like multiple different episodes have like
01:39:11 You know the school year ending or like them going to summer Christmas and it's like pretty sure uh the show makes fun of this fact
01:39:18 at certain points
01:39:21 About Bart and Lisa's age how'd they never age?
01:39:24 Yeah, isn't like one of the isn't like one of the inconsistencies is like the show started where uh
01:39:31 Homer's dad was like a world war two vet, but now he's like a korean war vet or something
01:39:35 But like a vietnam. Yeah something. Yeah something like that because because like yeah the the simpsons is
01:39:41 The simpsons is always happening in current in the current day
01:39:45 But the characters are always the same age
01:39:48 So like their past keeps like floating forward
01:39:51 It's like if you really think about it every single episode is a completely different universe
01:39:56 Where they're like a day like a week older
01:40:01 Because it's like springfield is like in a time bubble
01:40:04 But but but there's but there's a weird there's a weird wrinkle to it where like
01:40:09 Homer and Marge's uh, I think their prom always happened in a specific year
01:40:15 And like oh, yeah like that like completely throws a wrench into it
01:40:18 Well, no that episode where they say that is like a different universe from the other episodes
01:40:24 Yeah, true. That's all right. It's all it's all not canon with itself. And there's all you know the
01:40:29 Did you know that it's actually all just fiction and none of it even really happens
01:40:32 You know like the the zelda timeline where like it splits after a certain point
01:40:36 There's like a point in the home and the simpsons where like Homer starts a band
01:40:40 Homer doesn't start a band and that's where like the timelines diverge
01:40:44 The b sharps
01:40:46 Is it the b sharps because because there was the band because I know I haven't seen it
01:40:50 But I know that in a later season they do another like Homer and Marge like meat story that's set in the 90s
01:40:57 Yeah, and it's like a complete reimagining or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and it like completely rewrites the history
01:41:03 They're gonna do that eventually where it's like um Homer and Marge, uh, remember that I hope they don't I hope the show
01:41:09 Where they reminisce their time where they met where they were playing fortnight
01:41:13 Right they met on fortnight all those years ago probably during COVID-19
01:41:18 Do you remember when Homer subscribed Homer subscribed to Marge's only fans during during the quarantine? Yeah
01:41:27 Remember when you made Undertale, sweetie
01:41:32 But it is weird how uh
01:41:34 The world of the simpsons still looks and feels like it's based on 90s stereotypes even though they have newer stuff
01:41:41 Like I watched one time an episode where they had uh, I think uh, mr. Burns was playing the Wii
01:41:49 It just looks weird. It's like you're seeing the Wii in the 90s
01:41:52 Yeah, like a lot of the character designs like ironclad. This is what they are
01:41:58 I mean, they're pretty generic just like clothing wise, I guess
01:42:01 I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if I agree like
01:42:04 Yeah, like I don't like this does the world look particularly 90s though
01:42:09 I think the characters do like homers. It is the stereotypical dad from the 90s and
01:42:15 No, their entire family is like the stereotypical 90s. No, you're totally wrong. You're totally wrong. I think the only thing
01:42:21 That would be different. He's just wearing a shirt and jeans. It's the only thing that would be different
01:42:25 Um now is that all of these shirts would have like stupid
01:42:29 Text on them that sucks and isn't funny and there would be nothing that doesn't have a logo
01:42:35 Not on a sitcom
01:42:37 I mean
01:42:39 No, I think the character designs are timeless enough
01:42:43 Uh, they they look fine in any era. I mean like people in
01:42:48 I mean their house
01:42:49 I mean people today people live in houses that were built like 10 20 30 40 50 years ago and like it's normal
01:42:55 Um, but there's definitely some characters that are extremely 90s like um, the bus driver remember that guy
01:43:02 I don't remember his name
01:43:03 Auto
01:43:04 Yeah, okay
01:43:06 You know his his accent the way he dresses. I guess there's there's fucking there's fucking like long-haired waistoids in every era
01:43:15 Like the specific music he's like talking about maybe this because he talks about music. Yeah, he just talks like a 90s guy
01:43:23 A little bit
01:43:25 Yeah, that is yeah, I guess that's the most obvious one
01:43:29 um
01:43:30 I am like what if like nuclear power in the future just stops and becomes obsolete in the real world
01:43:36 Will they change mr. Burns and his nuclear power plant or will that stay?
01:43:42 Why would he runs a solar power plant? I'm just thinking of stuff
01:43:45 I'm just thinking of things that the simpsons has like very
01:43:48 Deeply ingrained and then like in the real world could change could anything change and then simpsons would have to change to keep up
01:43:57 I don't know if there is anything
01:43:59 I think they also drive the same car don't they?
01:44:02 I guess that's more of like a meta thing though not written necessarily
01:44:07 Yeah, they just the character himself. Did they get rid of the character or did they change the voice actor? I can't remember
01:44:13 I think they recast them
01:44:15 Okay, well, did they did they I thought they got rid of them
01:44:19 Uh, yeah, I don't know
01:44:22 Um recasting him is probably the right thing to do
01:44:25 I don't I don't know. I think if they I didn't see that there's much of a problem of it, but like
01:44:30 I yeah
01:44:33 I
01:44:34 I don't think yeah
01:44:37 I remember I remember watching why people didn't like it, but I do think that like apu's voice was
01:44:44 Hanka's area
01:44:45 and like
01:44:46 It's what what do you do at that point? I don't know my my take on that is really been a problem
01:44:51 If they had just like not made a big deal out of it. I don't think it would have yeah
01:44:55 I I remember watching hot diggity demons
01:44:59 The apu that I know video, which is a very good video where he goes into like why it's good
01:45:03 But it has some really cringy stuff in it
01:45:05 There's a few cringy moments in it
01:45:07 and I think the the thing that like
01:45:10 I disagree a little bit on is like he knows all about how apu because he's a big simpsons fan
01:45:16 and um, you know, if you look at apu
01:45:20 And you really understand everything that's going on with him
01:45:23 You you realize that he's not like a negative stereotype and it should be fine
01:45:27 the the thing is that
01:45:29 The people who it affects in like this the playground like not everybody notices
01:45:34 The the the subtle joke of like subverting the negative stereotype trope of the the immigrant who's like
01:45:43 I don't know. Well, he's not stupid. All right. He's like extremely intelligent and all and all these cool things
01:45:48 And that was what the show initially was doing because it's like
01:45:52 Progressive in that way. It's always been a little bit progressive
01:45:55 Yeah, but uh, the the average person doesn't necessarily understand that and they will still make fun of
01:46:01 Indian people by comparing them to apu from the simpsons
01:46:05 Regardless, okay, okay, okay, but let me I mean imagine a world in which apu was
01:46:12 The same idea. He's like an he's an immigrant from India
01:46:15 But you know, he's he's voiced by an Indian
01:46:18 Uh, and he's like, you know, he's he's all that and stuff and but he's otherwise like the same
01:46:24 You know, he's a convenience store owner
01:46:25 But he's got all these like things in his past that are interesting about him and he's he's
01:46:30 mostly the same character like
01:46:33 you you would still
01:46:35 I mean, he's it's such a popular show
01:46:38 And and he's like such kind of a fixture of it. I mean, I feel like there's no way that you could avoid
01:46:44 Indian people getting associated with this character who was like the only
01:46:48 You know, I feel like people would still make jokes about if they saw an Indian kid
01:46:53 They'd be like ha ha come again because that's what the guy says, you know
01:46:56 Like come again is not like a really stereotypical thing
01:46:59 But it's just that's the association because of this such a such a well. It's the it's the fault character
01:47:05 It's really just the fault of the simpsons being so successful and so widespread
01:47:10 That it's like even if even if you as a as a fan of the simpsons
01:47:14 You can recognize that he's not a negative stereotype. You can't stop people from doing it
01:47:20 When it's it's like on a surface level, they can see the similarity and they will say the things
01:47:26 So like I think both sides of the argument are kind of true
01:47:30 Like it doesn't it doesn't matter to you shouldn't try it. It shouldn't need to change
01:47:34 But I get that people
01:47:37 The problem the the problem of like oh people call me a poo
01:47:42 I don't know if there's any like way that could have been avoided
01:47:46 Other than just like not having an Indian in your show, which like that's stupid. Yeah
01:47:51 Uh like having an Indian voice actor wouldn't have changed that. Uh, yeah, I wouldn't have so it's like what is
01:47:58 Done, but I don't know. It's it's kind of dumb. It's kind of dumb
01:48:02 I I really think if the simpsons had like simply had simply not
01:48:06 Addressed the issue. I don't think they really would have had to change anything not that I think it's bad that they recast him, but like
01:48:13 I don't think they had to really probably probably would have blown over it would have blown over as these things are to do. Yeah
01:48:21 Maybe people were just uh overthinking it. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I'm looking and it says
01:48:27 I'm looking at wikipedia
01:48:29 No, it says voiced by hank azaria 1990 to 2020
01:48:33 Wait, are you still doing it?
01:48:34 Simpsons creator mac grading stated in august 2019 that a poo will remain on the show. So I guess they didn't
01:48:39 I guess we're just stupid. Well, they just didn't do any of that
01:48:43 Faced I never I never really looked into it. I just heard about it. So no, I don't know. It's it seems like they didn't do anything
01:48:51 Okay, well, I thought uh, they were going to do something, but I'm not sure if they actually did
01:48:56 They might have said they were going to do something and then waited for everyone. Yeah to stop listening. Yeah
01:49:02 Oh, we're definitely going to care about what you just said
01:49:06 Well, no
01:49:08 Um, yeah, but in that situation, they probably should have just not addressed it at all
01:49:13 Yeah, the the the the bit with like, you know the bit where like lisa's in bed and she's got the picture of a poo on the table
01:49:20 Oh god. Yeah, that's it's so weird. It's such an awkward. I've seen that clip. It's embarrassing
01:49:25 What what clip? I don't know this
01:49:28 It's hard to even describe because it sounds like a fever dream
01:49:31 There's there's like a there was like a subplot in a in an episode that was like that was totally
01:49:37 Totally not about anything in particular guys. Although well, I shouldn't say like that
01:49:42 It was about the whole up who controversy here. Let me let me see if I can find it
01:49:46 We're like lisa's
01:49:47 Is like talking to marge and they even like look at the camera when they're like talking about how like, oh
01:49:52 He's it's from a different time. There's there's nothing we can do about it one of them
01:49:59 They say that and then it was bad
01:50:01 But but they also like don't really say anything because she says like
01:50:06 These issues will be addressed at a future some issues will be addressed at a future date
01:50:11 If at all and then marge like looks at the camera gravely and nods and I just don't know what the fuck they were thinking
01:50:17 But I guess I don't know what the fuck they were thinking
01:50:20 Like the thumbnail yeah, it's like I feel like I'm about to get apologized to by
01:50:27 I don't want to see it. I don't want to have like youtube rip like apology energy
01:50:31 It looks you know what it looks like people talking about it never mind
01:50:35 It looks like an antoons video about like the characters are at their funeral
01:50:39 You know now, you know why into symptoms is bad now
01:50:44 It's because it seems like this probably it's like you can't find the clip
01:50:48 I also don't understand. Um, I mean it's it's similar to did you see that like the song like the donald trump song with like the squad?
01:50:56 I I've not uh, no
01:50:58 I didn't see that during the democratic primaries and it ends with like a fucking like conga line of all the democratic candidates
01:51:04 Like dancing and it's so embarrassing. It's so it's the worst thing i've ever seen. It does sound pretty embarrassing
01:51:11 it's the squad like
01:51:13 Doing a fucking musical number where they all like chase trump around the white house and like
01:51:18 Wag their fingers at him and and stuff and he's like, oh i'm trying to bumble my way around and oh
01:51:24 I tripped over some some stairs and oh i'm trying to get away from these these women because i'm scared of them
01:51:31 It's so it's a nightmare. It's just a nightmare. I I let me listen
01:51:35 Let me I feel like maybe I haven't made it clear in the discussion
01:51:38 I hate the simpsons now and I want it to fucking die. I really do
01:51:42 Yeah, I wish it had died along. I haven't really delved into like i'm not a simpsons apologist at all
01:51:47 I haven't really delved into like the latest stuff and I don't keep tabs on it. So
01:51:51 um
01:51:52 That sounds I don't I don't care if it's I don't care if it's less bad than it used to be it's trash and it should be dead
01:51:59 uh, I'm thinking of like what they would usually do when they wanted to make fun of a
01:52:03 president or something they would just have them be in an episode and say
01:52:08 Or do something evil or or
01:52:11 Not evil, but like um
01:52:13 I don't know like
01:52:15 They've had bill bill clinton with mr. Burns. They would they would just have just have them say a funny line
01:52:20 That's like oh, yeah, we all know about that
01:52:23 controversy. Yeah
01:52:25 Yeah, just like pop in for like a little like one-line gag or something
01:52:29 It's I mean they they had the episode where um, uh, george bush moved in next door
01:52:35 Is it which was just a big
01:52:37 fucking um
01:52:39 I don't know
01:52:40 But wasn't that one of the newer episodes that sucked?
01:52:45 I've all of w then. Yeah
01:52:47 You know, no, it was george. It was george hw. It was first first bush. Oh, then that's the golden. You don't know
01:52:52 That's the one with that's the one with two bad neighbors
01:52:56 You don't know about I don't have watched that. I don't really remember. I don't know if I've seen that one. They um
01:53:02 George george bush, uh, uh really hates uh homer and bark
01:53:07 And so he he does some mischief. He spray paints too bad neighbors and like their faces
01:53:13 But he spray paints it on his own house so that they can see it like from across the street
01:53:18 Um, and that's it. That's the joke. He spray paints his own house to get back at them
01:53:22 Very clever. Yeah, I don't know. That's why that guy was ahead of the cia
01:53:27 I feel I feel I feel like that episode is kind of light on actual commentary
01:53:33 Uh, I mean it's been like it's been like talked about before and I don't want to go too deep into it
01:53:40 But but like it feels like trump just like broke a lot of like comedians brains
01:53:46 Yeah, the the reality of the situation is like almost too absurd to make jokes about so the sentence is a comedy
01:53:54 I
01:53:57 Thank you. Good night, everybody
01:53:59 Hope you had fun
01:54:00 I saw a clips of like the the like the episode about voting where homer goes to vote
01:54:06 And it was stupid. It wasn't as bad as the as the song, but it was really stupid
01:54:12 Yeah, whenever I see uh, I saw the clip
01:54:14 I saw the clip of like baby bernie sanders having his goons like beat up other kids in the playground
01:54:19 And I was like this show needs to die the show needs to die
01:54:22 This is whenever I see uh clips of the newer seasons. Uh, I was cringe
01:54:27 Uh, it's it's it's it's it's a nightmare. Honestly. I'm getting depressed. It definitely wasn't based. That's for sure
01:54:35 Definitely not based. I don't think any show should go on for that long
01:54:40 No, it's been like what over 20 years now
01:54:44 30 30 30 32 years
01:54:49 Going on 33, baby. That's ridiculous
01:54:52 It's it's unacceptable. It's a it's a thought crime. It's art crime is what it is. Make a new fucking show
01:54:57 Make a new fucking show you cowards
01:55:00 Wasn't uh, wasn't that what future drama was supposed to be? Yeah, that's better than every way
01:55:06 Especially then in the the way that it didn't go on forever and ruin itself
01:55:12 It almost did it it does it does have that going for it
01:55:15 And you could you could argue that like some of the comedy central seasons aren't as strong
01:55:18 But it did end before it got too bad. Yeah, I'd agree
01:55:22 There was um, was it there was another Matt Groening show from like a few years ago on netflix game of thrones
01:55:28 Yeah, game of thrones. That was it
01:55:30 I I never watched disenchanted. Uh, me neither. I heard it wasn't that good. It looked dumb. I didn't want to see it
01:55:37 I remember when uh future roma first came out
01:55:40 There was a lot of hype for it and I thought it was going to replace the simpsons. I thought the simpsons was going to end
01:55:46 Um, but that didn't happen the plan. Yeah back in the day anything could have happened
01:55:51 Um, but it didn't instead nothing happened
01:55:56 Um, yeah, I remember being hyped for future roma
01:55:59 Uh, future roma was good. Don't get me wrong
01:56:02 But I wouldn't say that like
01:56:04 The best future roma is better than the best simpsons
01:56:07 That's kind of just that's kind of just the zoomer in me talking because I've seen way more future roma than I've seen simpsons
01:56:13 Oh, no. Oh, no. Yeah, the best
01:56:15 Sorry, I'm a little baby boy
01:56:17 Simpsons is funnier than future roma was definitely like peaks peak simpsons is funnier future roma has other things going for it
01:56:24 It's got more of like an arc, which is nice. I guess it's more of a of a narrative show the simpsons is more of
01:56:32 Here's a concept and let's tell jokes while we explore it for a few for like 20 30 minutes
01:56:38 Yeah
01:56:40 Well, you know me i'm a big fan of jokes
01:56:43 What what
01:56:46 What
01:56:48 What tell tell us a joke funny man
01:56:50 He has been the whole episode. Yeah, make us laugh
01:56:54 I make us laugh clown
01:56:57 I couldn't think of anything on funny to say
01:56:59 Oh, that's right. I'm sorry
01:57:04 Um
01:57:06 Now what voicemail
01:57:08 I can't think I don't really go anything else to say. Yeah, we we could voicemail
01:57:13 All right. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. It's been two hours very based very based
01:57:18 Uh, let me pull them up and we will get to going right. Okay, not to sound green. Um, how do you like?
01:57:27 You activate voicemail. Oh, oh, it's easy. You'll see. Um, I'll just post it in the chat and you just play it in the chat
01:57:33 It's fine
01:57:35 Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's all there is to it. That is easy
01:57:38 Um, okay. Uh, let me see. This one is called
01:57:45 Hold on I gotta get back to
01:57:49 Reality oh there goes gravity
01:57:52 Um, this one is called
01:57:57 The worst accent. Okay, three two one go
01:58:02 Guys the worst accent occurs either when Finnish people try to speak English or when Americans try to speak French
01:58:10 Like you think Ben desperately trying to pronounce the words croque monsieur and croque madame was just embarrassing
01:58:17 Wait, I I said I went at length after I tried to say that I went at length or maybe it wasn't then but
01:58:24 Like recently I went on at length about how I don't understand
01:58:27 How french is pronounced and I think it's a nonsense language monsieur
01:58:32 Madame the yeah, the the sandwiches
01:58:35 The croque croque croque monsieur and croque madame. What are you just doing like a like a I hate this person
01:58:42 This is their argument voice
01:58:44 That's right. Well, what's your point? The worst accent is uh, whatever I've got I guess
01:58:50 What is your accent?
01:58:52 Uh, I don't know. I assume midwest. Gamers accent. Yeah, it's gamer
01:58:57 Well, there's not enough there's not enough bad words and gamers tavern
01:59:01 So you have you have a he's speaking like a gamer gamers tavern. You have a you have a uh, uh
01:59:08 I don't want to say unusual because that sounds negative, but you have like a you have kind of a
01:59:12 Unusual cadence to your voice. Where where are you from?
01:59:16 Uh, the u.s
01:59:17 Just can you be any more specific press him?
01:59:20 Okay. Gamers tavern values his privacy. Don't dox. Don't dox yourself. I guess
01:59:25 I guess if I had to guess I would say midwest
01:59:28 You can say I'm from I'm from the south
01:59:31 Oh
01:59:33 Mexico
01:59:34 Yeah
01:59:36 Is that why you were talking about green cards earlier? I don't hear the south at all. I don't hear southern at all
01:59:41 Yeah, uh, where where I live. Nobody has a southern accent. Um, even though it is technically in the south
01:59:49 New york
01:59:51 Very mysterious south to me
01:59:54 Hey, it's somewhere and that's all that matters
01:59:57 It's south to someone
01:59:59 Yeah, everywhere south to canadian
02:00:02 canadia
02:00:04 I don't I don't know what a finished accent sounds like he said he said the worst accent is a finished
02:00:10 His accent was he finished? I don't think he was that he was finished. Yeah
02:00:14 I guess I think he was french because he took such issue with me
02:00:18 mispronouncing french
02:00:21 But who knows he didn't sound I couldn't I couldn't quite tell I don't actually know what finish sounds like
02:00:25 I know what swedish people talking english sounds like
02:00:28 I had um, he didn't sound finish
02:00:31 There was a girl in my high school who was french
02:00:33 But she didn't I mean she didn't have an accent or anything
02:00:36 When I was when I've like met french people
02:00:38 I don't know like there's a very like sort of cartoony idea of like uh-huh
02:00:42 Monsieur that like sounds very french, but when I've actually met french people and heard them talk
02:00:46 They don't sound like that. They just have like a things are not like a much
02:00:50 They have a much less recognizable accent that I honestly have a hard time differentiating from like a german accent
02:00:57 I mean france is a very big country. There's probably multiple dialects that they have
02:01:02 I know I know a bit of it's like english, right? Well, yeah, but english
02:01:07 No, yeah, I guess it would be
02:01:09 Accent like sheffield. I've got uh, I've got relatives in canada who speak french, but I don't speak french myself
02:01:17 french canadian cock and bush
02:01:19 That's not terrible. It's awful. That's god awful
02:01:23 um
02:01:26 spaghetti
02:01:30 That's italian. Wee wee spaghetti por favor. Wee wee spaghetti marion prussian
02:01:35 Arigato gozaimasu
02:01:38 Thank god for brexit because otherwise
02:01:42 Otherwise, uh, they would they would be easily able to travel over to the uk and kill me
02:01:49 But no longer they would like nothing more than to do the the pcp sleeper cells are on their way
02:01:56 Um, okay, the next the next voicemail is called um
02:02:01 Dana wilson, okay
02:02:04 three two one go
02:02:07 So my husband of 14 years is super bummed out
02:02:10 Uh, he had me do one of those Kawasaki scroll things and like the tiny like
02:02:17 But I he just handed me like a piece of paper and said I need you to read this and then threw the phone in my face and so
02:02:25 You guys only like did a second of it and he was like
02:02:29 I mean, I guess it was appropriate, but like I'm kind of bummed out
02:02:33 And so I feel really bad. I just kind of wanted to let you guys know that like we're happy. It's over
02:02:39 If it if it's actually over
02:02:42 They still really sad though
02:02:43 So if you could just I guess do a voicemail shout out it took me and you know
02:02:47 It's funny is the only way that I figured out who you guys were because I said, oh
02:02:51 What what's the show thing that you like and he's like, oh, it's procrastinators
02:02:55 The only way I figured out how to find this website was by entering Kawasaki scroll
02:03:00 And I don't believe that's how I figured out
02:03:03 What your whole podcast was called?
02:03:05 So yeah, just shout out to my sad mopey husband. Oh, shit
02:03:11 Oh, he's coming back. Anyways. Yeah, just just in secret letting you guys know. Okay. Bye
02:03:17 That's that's epic
02:03:19 I don't remember my head. Do you get it give? Um, well, it's one of those one of those samurai scroll
02:03:25 Things there was a high pitched voice
02:03:28 And we didn't I can't remember if I was there even but I remember it
02:03:32 And was this from a voicemail last week voicemail last week or the week before or something and um
02:03:39 At that point the whole Kawasaki scroll ninja scroll thing
02:03:43 Uh was sort of played out and we were kind of tired of it. So I think we may have skipped it
02:03:47 That's course
02:03:48 So, I don't know
02:03:50 Uh, I uh, that has not explained it. Big gomenosai to this feels like so this feels like a
02:03:56 hugely meta like big brain like step
02:04:00 That I feel like part one of six of a new arc and I'm not I'm worried
02:04:05 I do you think someone who watches the pcp has been married for 13 years
02:04:09 I like I get gib I
02:04:12 Yes, I under obviously I understand that this is connected to the samurai because it references the
02:04:17 Kawasaki scrolls, but other than that, I I do not understand how it relates at all
02:04:22 Well, we're gonna need a lecture on the samurai thing
02:04:26 I mean the the reason it's gotten so confusing is because I think
02:04:30 Like I'm still not even sure that there were multiple people trying to be
02:04:35 the Kawasaki scroll ninja like
02:04:38 Cool funny well the samurai said last time that that's not true and that it yeah
02:04:44 Is at least mostly all one person so like this person who who who had his wife do a bit
02:04:49 And maybe it wasn't the original and he was trying to make it like I'm gonna do this thing
02:04:55 There's no wife. This is this is a fiction. You've been duped. Huh?
02:05:00 I refuse to believe that this is someone's wife
02:05:03 Yeah, me too. Yeah, at least in this context. I'm yeah, maybe he's happily married. How can that?
02:05:09 Why is that the most confusing part? No one who listens to the pcp could be happily married
02:05:14 And there's no way a pcp fan would be married
02:05:18 This is um, yeah
02:05:20 All right. Yeah, okay. It's too much. It's too much. I can't let's just say let's just say the pineapple is upside down
02:05:28 Yeah, exactly
02:05:30 Yeah, there it is. I hope so. I hope so DMs are open. She sounded cute. She had a cute voice, so
02:05:37 You know
02:05:40 Uh hit hit me up hit me in the DM
02:05:43 No hitting my DMs. I said pineapple first. No, no kill give no kill give
02:05:48 Um, next one is called. Um wandering through dead fandom. Oh, this one's long
02:05:54 Yeah, three two one go
02:05:58 so I've been uh
02:06:00 replaying some old video games that I never really got around to experiencing and uh
02:06:05 One of those games was shadow of the claustus. I played the ps4 remake and
02:06:10 I've run into a bit of a problem where
02:06:12 The game's so good and I really want to talk about it
02:06:15 But everybody's been talking about it for like 20 plus years or whatever it is. Yeah, and so
02:06:21 They like everybody knows everything about it. There's nothing that I can add to the conversation. Yeah, so like
02:06:28 I feel this there there's like an avoid in my soul of talking about something that's really cool
02:06:34 That I just can't fill because nobody wants to talk about the 20 year old game, you know
02:06:39 Uh, so I'm wondering. Uh, is there anything that you've experienced?
02:06:44 Far beyond its popularity that made you feel that way that left that pit inside your being
02:06:50 Of expression of passion
02:06:53 Um, also mr. Saints. I want to apologize
02:06:57 Few episodes ago. I was I uh, I was naive. I hadn't been up on the
02:07:03 The lore and such and I I just went ahead and uh sent in a voicemail about foreskin and I uh,
02:07:10 I want to apologize for adding to the
02:07:13 You should we were doing so good. I appreciate I appreciate the apology. No, no, it's all abysmal
02:07:19 Beating of that dead horse. Absolutely disgraceful. Yeah, I'm good. I'm beating
02:07:24 My foreskin just the foreskin though. Well, I don't have that
02:07:28 Oh
02:07:33 So with regards to that the only thing that comes close for me is I got into the game of thrones tv show
02:07:40 Um, well after it had been going
02:07:44 And I got like up to it was like the the last the second till the last season was coming out
02:07:52 I think or like the the second to last season was wrapping up and I was getting into the show
02:07:56 And I was learning about all the stuff that had been talked about
02:07:59 Four years prior to this and I was like, oh now I get what they were all talking about
02:08:04 But I didn't feel like an empty void in my soul. I don't know
02:08:08 Um, it's it's fine to just talk about something to no one, isn't it?
02:08:14 Just make a blog. I think this person will find that um that like
02:08:18 Even if what they're saying isn't exactly new fans of whatever will will just like the fact that you're into it as well
02:08:26 I
02:08:27 When I made the sonichu lecture, I was like, this is all well worn ground. Everybody already knows this stuff
02:08:33 Like none of what I none of what I say is new. Yeah. Yeah, but I really like that's true of like literally literally every fucking video on youtube
02:08:41 Is someone like looked up some shit on wikipedia and just like wrote it down and then like read it to you
02:08:46 Like nothing is new
02:08:48 Right. Nothing. I'm having a similar sort of problem that he had
02:08:54 Uh, we're like, I'm coming to something so late like I'm working on a video right now
02:08:58 And I'm talking about like a bunch of like these old these like pretty old games that are critically acclaimed
02:09:04 But like at least I have like some sort of outlet to talk about that and like a youtube video or whatever
02:09:10 For someone like this. I I think just talking to your friends about it would suffice just fine
02:09:15 It's pretty good advice
02:09:17 I often have this uh issue because uh 99 of the games I play are either 20 to 25 years old
02:09:24 Yeah, so, um
02:09:26 I have a friend I talked to who is also into
02:09:30 Retro games and every once in a while when I play something I'll
02:09:33 I'll just talk to him about it
02:09:37 Um, I mean sometimes even when I replay stuff, I'll talk about it too
02:09:42 Is is this person like looking to like make content out of their talk?
02:09:47 Or is they or are they just like they just want to talk about it to someone
02:09:50 I guess that's like they can't find a discussion to involve themselves in that that's a little different
02:09:58 But yeah, that's that's unfortunate. I I feel that I don't think there are content creator
02:10:02 This is this is why people will go and like be like and like make someone play a game that they like
02:10:08 It's just because I need someone to talk about it with like, oh, oh, you never played. Oh, you gotta play
02:10:12 I gotta I gotta live my experience. I'm pretty sure there are communities online dedicated to this sort of thing
02:10:18 Like on reddit or on various forums and stuff
02:10:21 I just I just watched um a video this week about like this the search for the last secret
02:10:27 That's like that jaco geller video, right?
02:10:30 Is that who it is?
02:10:31 Um, I've heard of that video. Yeah, like blue point
02:10:35 In the remake added in some sort of like urban legend thing that was yeah
02:10:39 Yeah, they added a thing behind the door in the shrine of the of the the small colossus
02:10:46 Yes, it's funny because they did the same thing in the demon souls remake
02:10:50 Did they?
02:10:51 Yeah, there was like this um, there was like this hunt to find to find like what was behind some door that was added in the remake ended
02:10:57 Um, uh, it involved like playing the game and like the new like mirror mode or whatever and like finding these like
02:11:06 These coins on the ground giving them to the crow
02:11:09 And then you get like a key and inside of the room is uh is like the penetrator's armor
02:11:13 Which is like a an armor set from that that that was from like a boss
02:11:18 That wasn't really original game. It's really interesting
02:11:22 It's really interesting in in the shadow of the colossus
02:11:24 There's like there's really strong evidence that like a secret should be in this spot
02:11:30 Like like if you hear the case laid out, it's like yeah
02:11:32 It really looks like this is like a map that is pointing you towards something secret here in the spot
02:11:38 It's kind of a lost art because there was a lot of stuff like that in games
02:11:42 Like uh, like like the mu under the truck thing is but yeah, but there's but there's nothing
02:11:46 I'm sensical
02:11:48 Yeah, but like there there is a truck in that area of the game and it is weird. Why is it there?
02:11:55 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly
02:11:57 Yeah, sometimes there's like things get removed from games before they get released
02:12:02 Yeah, there's these there's these four
02:12:05 points on the map
02:12:06 And there's there's references to like there's references to
02:12:10 Intersecting points
02:12:12 And there's these four points on the map that just happen to be arranged in a perfect cross that makes a right angle with itself
02:12:18 And there's a shrine exactly at the intersection of that cross
02:12:22 And that shrine has this weird looking door in it that is not there for any discernible reason
02:12:27 And it's like yep
02:12:29 Looks like there's a secret here. That reminds me of yeah, it might be cut content
02:12:35 It reminds me of the door and banjo kazooie and the ice key and all that stuff
02:12:39 Yeah, fucking cyber shell cyber shell did a video on on like the stop and swoop stuff
02:12:45 And like that shit controlled my life for like a month. I was so obsessed with it
02:12:51 I might only know about that because of cyber shells video. It's a good vid
02:12:56 Uh, I've known about that since uh the game came out because I I played it back. Yeah
02:13:02 I know I wasn't an n64 kid
02:13:04 So I didn't have banjo kazooie, but I know what you're talking about now
02:13:07 It's it's just such a it was like such a cool idea for
02:13:11 For like a secret in a game and it just like it never ended up truly being what it was meant to be which is which is a damn shame
02:13:19 And that that ice key really kept me up at night
02:13:23 It's it's a lost art nowadays
02:13:26 You can't really you you you can't really do the same sort of stuff that you could back them because like the internet and
02:13:32 Ah, shit. Sorry internet and like data mining and whatnot
02:13:35 Yeah, uh, I think like the binding of isaac kind of tried to do something similar with like the lost
02:13:41 But um, yeah people people like they fucking dug into the files and figured it out data minded. Yeah, I heard about that
02:13:48 Much to uh edmund's uh chagrin
02:13:51 Yeah, but I mean of course they were gonna do I know yeah, it's it's it's kind of like
02:13:56 It's kind of like when my like like my video got copyright strike like I'm upset, but I'm also I get it
02:14:03 Yeah, yeah
02:14:06 Technology is too strong
02:14:09 We we uh next one next voicemail is called. Um
02:14:14 Uh
02:14:15 Nate's holiday message
02:14:18 Okay
02:14:19 I don't know what this is three two one go
02:14:23 Hope you guys have a good holiday
02:14:25 Merry christmas and all the other shit. Oh you jews
02:14:29 You and your hanukkah. Oh god. Get a real holiday
02:14:33 I'll fight your hanukkah with my christmas bro
02:14:38 And uh have a good one
02:14:40 I don't know
02:14:42 See you in the new year suckers
02:14:44 suck on my
02:14:46 toes
02:14:47 This feels like the the the bizarro version of that germa Thanksgiving message
02:14:53 Oh, is that the one it's it's it's the one where it pans. Yeah with the mirror. Yeah
02:14:59 Yeah, look anyone look it up if you don't know what it is you you just just watch it don't
02:15:04 I will say nothing further germa. I guess we've already heard from Nate
02:15:09 I can't remember
02:15:10 All right, hang on. I I saw it this year. I don't know if it's from earlier
02:15:14 It it was it he posted it like late Thanksgiving. I'm gonna
02:15:18 Yeah, I'm jamey jamey pull that up
02:15:23 Yeah, all right here it is
02:15:26 Yeah, I've
02:15:28 Saw this on my timeline this year
02:15:30 And it was at first I thought it that was the that email was someone like splicing Nate clips together
02:15:36 But I think that's just from a stream
02:15:39 Or maybe like his podcast. I don't know
02:15:42 I have no yeah, I don't remember that
02:15:45 Yeah, I have no idea where it's from. I it might be spliced together. It might just be from somewhere
02:15:49 Maybe it may be like something they would say on the stream. Yeah, it does. Yeah, it does
02:15:55 Well, so the only way Nate will be on the pcb is through voicemails, I guess
02:15:59 But he would he would he would never he would never stoop to saying it on the on the pro crass natives podcast though
02:16:05 We have to get we have to get his second hand
02:16:08 It's a deep fake ass
02:16:12 I think we put like cushions in there or something. I was gonna ask is that did he just stuff it or no
02:16:18 That's is that was that part of his joke or was that something someone else? No, no, that's part of the original tweet
02:16:25 Okay
02:16:26 Yeah, okay, but it's delivered what I mean. I think germa's probably just had like a dump truck ass this entire time
02:16:31 We just never seen it. Definitely. I mean, when when would you have seen it? Yeah
02:16:37 How would you know?
02:16:39 That's a big reveal. I gotta start following germa 985 on twitter
02:16:45 Germa's fucking great
02:16:48 He's so but you are all good. Yes
02:16:51 I don't know anything. That's just because you're stupid ben
02:16:54 No, it's because you're no, it's no, I don't know anything because you're stupid
02:16:59 Uh, that's a good point. Let me let me get the next one. Okay. The next voicemail is called
02:17:07 wait
02:17:09 Oh, uh, yeah, the next voicemail is called. Uh, thank you
02:17:13 God, it's a minute 30 three two one go
02:17:17 So to cut to the chase through all the emotional bullshit
02:17:21 I really just want to know. Yeah, how do you feel about the past seven years of your life?
02:17:26 me personally
02:17:28 Um, it's been a nightmare. You know, I've been growing up. I was like, uh, I was in middle school when I first found
02:17:34 Digi's videos and soon after, you know, within months
02:17:38 Found you guys's videos and I didn't really care about anybody's videos. I just like my little pony and fan base
02:17:45 But beyond that, I'm mostly I'm just wondering how do you guys feel about spending?
02:17:51 You know seven years of your lives devoted to your internet career
02:17:55 I mean, obviously you've been doing it since before that
02:17:59 And things have always been the same for you. They've they've changed dramatically for me
02:18:03 But I understand that you live the similar lifestyle that you did back in 2012. Well, does that mean? Yeah, just
02:18:10 I really enjoyed your stuff. I take it for granted way more than I should
02:18:15 and just
02:18:17 You know to make an interesting pcp voicemail to start a discussion like how do you feel about
02:18:23 The seven years that you've spent
02:18:25 And the ride you've taken with the algorithm and how it's really affected your career
02:18:30 And your outlook on things
02:18:32 And how it's changed over time
02:18:35 I'm really excited to know because it bring a lot of context to
02:18:40 What I'm thinking it's almost done and what I'm you know, just what I'm projecting on to you. So thank you
02:18:47 Well, uh
02:18:50 Um, what do I think about spending the seven years doing whatever? Uh, well, I wish I had the seven years back
02:18:56 Uh, but uh, I would think that no matter how I spent them. So whatever seven years ago. That's like 2013
02:19:03 2013 I don't think I started hypocrite back then. I don't even know
02:19:08 No
02:19:09 Seven years was like pre seven years ago was like pre teabab
02:19:14 Yeah, what if 2014 was when we started pony stuff? Um
02:19:19 Yeah, I don't know. I started back then I was still in 2013
02:19:24 I was still pre pre like
02:19:27 Further education. I was just out of like secondary school and I was like
02:19:32 I don't know what I'm doing
02:19:34 Now I slightly know what I'm doing. So that's good
02:19:37 I have I have like talents that have grown a little bit
02:19:41 And it's it's all right
02:19:43 you know
02:19:45 Can't complain too much. I'm making money. Is it I'm making money talking about stuff with ben saint online. It's pretty good
02:19:51 Now that's the dream right there
02:19:54 Wait, didn't didn't you uh, uh, discover my stuff in 2013 or was that later?
02:20:01 And I can't remember. No, it must have been later. It may have been a little later
02:20:05 Not too much later though
02:20:08 Because uh, I think I started this channel in 2012 and the first video I uploaded was in 2013
02:20:16 I feel like I found you like maybe four years ago
02:20:20 Jesse found him first right jesse and good
02:20:23 Yeah
02:20:24 Yeah, just see I think posted something in the chat and I looked at it and I was like, oh my god, this is really funny
02:20:31 Isn't that great when you just find like a when you just find a channel
02:20:35 Through the help of no one in particular
02:20:38 It always feels good. It kind of feels like a it almost feels like a secret club
02:20:42 Yeah, I definitely uh felt pretty good for me
02:20:46 Eh
02:20:47 Cool. Yeah, that's that's that's all it's also cool too when like people you people you respect
02:20:52 You find out that they watch like your content. I remember um
02:20:56 I remember I was watching like a running shine stream like a few months ago
02:21:00 And uh, and like I was talking in this chat and he was like, oh, it's a tonic improv. I love that guy and it's like, ah
02:21:05 It feels good
02:21:07 It's nice to get validation from people you respect
02:21:09 Yeah, well it was weird for me because I didn't know gib or jesse when they first left comments on my on my stuff
02:21:16 And um, I checked their channels out after they left comments and I was like, whoa, these guys have a lot of subscribers and they're pretty good
02:21:24 Uh, it feels real nice to get complimented by them. I suppose
02:21:29 Yeah
02:21:30 I'm glad it was it was nice
02:21:32 So it always feels nice giving a good comment when you mean it when like I don't comment that much
02:21:38 like, um
02:21:40 I I always try to comment really positive things on on on channels
02:21:44 Uh, just so that because like a lot of comments now suck. They're just like repeating parts of the video
02:21:50 They're not very interesting. They may be positive generally
02:21:53 but they're never like
02:21:55 in depth enough to warrant any sort of like
02:21:57 I don't know thought
02:22:00 Just sort of like
02:22:03 So I like to give like a like a very appreciate
02:22:06 Uh, appreciate it. Yeah, like a more in depth kind of you got shouted out by by running shine
02:22:11 Yeah, we we we talk in dm sometimes or that's awesome running shine. That's awesome. I love running shine. Yeah, he's great
02:22:18 Who's that?
02:22:19 I want him on the podcast. He's uh, he's like I've been meaning to ask him, but I'm too chicken
02:22:24 He's one of the game he he does like gaming videos. Um, he made a he made like a
02:22:29 I think an hour and a half long review of that like yick game y2k
02:22:35 That's how I found him
02:22:36 Yeah
02:22:37 While my friends tabby tabby nickel like linked his review and the uh, or their review because it's like a bunch
02:22:42 It's a couple of people but uh, wait, wait, wait running shine is more than one person
02:22:47 Yeah, yeah, um, there's uh, two people write the video uh mellow and tropics mellow is the one who like narrates them
02:22:54 What and there's a couple of other people who do like the music and stuff. Yeah
02:22:58 Oh, I just thought it was one dude
02:23:01 Yeah, well, uh, that sounds pretty uh professional
02:23:06 Yeah, it it's he's they're really funny and also informative. It's just uh
02:23:13 That's a really good video the yick video like kind of blew up and that's how I've watched I've literally watched it like four times
02:23:20 Because I'm stupid that reminds me of uh, I was talking to a friend of mine one time about my content and he
02:23:26 He offered to write the scripts and I would do the voicing
02:23:30 And I was like, uh
02:23:33 I would rather do it the other way around I write the scripts and you do the voicing because uh, really I'm more of a writer
02:23:39 I'm not very good at talking
02:23:41 Huh, but I ended up doing everything myself
02:23:45 Um, if I got a good man, if I had a good script writer
02:23:48 I would love to just like read some shit that somebody else wrote because I hate writing. Um, it's boring
02:23:54 Like you said, um, I hate it when it doesn't go anywhere
02:23:58 Yeah
02:23:59 No, that sounds like a sweetheart deal honestly
02:24:02 Uh, yeah, I'd fuck I'd do that
02:24:04 Yeah, it would be cool if I could work with someone who had a good voice to read my scripts instead of doing it
02:24:12 But I I have no choice to gotta use my own voice
02:24:16 Tragic
02:24:17 That's just uh, to me, that's your brand
02:24:21 Well, it is now it's so integral to your brand
02:24:24 Just wouldn't it wouldn't be gamers
02:24:26 You're dry delivery that really sells the absurdity of what is happening in your videos just the constant barrage of the puns and jokes
02:24:35 The way wouldn't I don't know like whether it would be better if it was someone else's voice at this point
02:24:40 Are you guys ready for the next voicemail? It's called thank you too. Oh, no again. Yeah
02:24:46 Three two one go
02:24:50 Also, by the way, um as an amendment horseshoe finale obliterated taken down gone
02:24:56 The wwe claimed the video
02:24:59 It only happened like a month ago or a month or two ago. So very recently
02:25:04 Um, yeah, that legacy is tarnished forever
02:25:08 It's probably never coming back because I don't think jesse wants to deal with all that
02:25:12 I don't I don't really know what the process is like, but it sounds like a nightmare. So
02:25:16 Yeah
02:25:17 Sad day
02:25:19 Um, at least we have new horizons to look at
02:25:22 It's not like anybody fucking wants those horizons though. It seems like everybody's in a fucking nightmare shit hole
02:25:29 Uh, no offense to you or anybody else. I mean, I'm a I'm a loser
02:25:33 Compared to that. I have no room to talk not to talk about me, but just to say damn
02:25:38 Sounds like a fucking nightmare
02:25:41 Uh, I don't know what he means by that like new horizons. I don't know what he means by that either
02:25:47 I think he just means like the future of youtube and everyone
02:25:50 It just you know one of those like pcp. That's that's really that's really reaching is dead comments. I'm not sure
02:25:56 That's that's really reaching for uh for uh for a silver lining. It's like, oh, yeah, everything sucks
02:26:01 But hey at least the future will occur like yep, this too. It will
02:26:07 Yeah, um
02:26:09 I did did horseshoe finale get taken down. Yeah, I I heard about it a little while ago. I was like, oh, that sucks
02:26:16 Um, yeah, that kind of sucks. I don't have to do another rewatch of the horseshoe reviews
02:26:21 It's been a long time since I've watched them. I don't even know that maybe someone has reuploaded it
02:26:26 It seems like something someone would have downloaded
02:26:29 now
02:26:30 I kind of thought that like the more time passed and the more times I revisited it
02:26:36 The less I liked horseshoe finale. I kind of thought it was getting worse the longer it it existed
02:26:42 In hindsight not to not to speak for him, but I feel like jesse would probably agree
02:26:48 I don't think he's particularly proud of of a lot of his videos
02:26:52 Maybe horseshoe finale is different because you know, it's it's horseshoe finale. It was very cathartic
02:26:57 um as
02:26:59 It was happening because it was like take making fun of people
02:27:03 Like josh scorcher who is like so irrelevant now. It doesn't matter
02:27:07 It's one of the it feels like one of those you had to be there kind of
02:27:11 It at the at the time it was an it was like a very impactful statement that meant a lot
02:27:17 To a bunch of people now. It's like, yeah
02:27:21 Removed from that context. It's a very strange cultural artifact
02:27:26 Well ever since I was cool in its own way actually actually describing it like that makes me like it more
02:27:31 Ever since I discovered jesse's content. I've been a big fan of his so
02:27:36 It does bother me to see anything. He's done be taken down. Yeah
02:27:41 It's a bummer. Um
02:27:44 Wait, there was
02:27:45 Was there something else to the voicemail? No, it was just like horseshoe finale gone. Also new horizons
02:27:51 I thought he was talking about animal crossing for a second a little bit
02:27:55 Like someone made like a horseshoe finale for animal crossing
02:27:59 Oh, I want that would be interesting cult corona in in animal crossing. Is he in there?
02:28:06 Can I be in this got to be a horse?
02:28:12 There's no horse. What's the point? Well, there's got to be a horse
02:28:16 But it's cult corona. Is there a horsey sauce?
02:28:23 Wide a long face
02:28:26 Let's let's let's let's move on to new horizons. The next voicemail is called
02:28:32 Uh, well, it's a youtube link. So I guess let's just listen to it three two one go
02:28:38 So pcb. I'm just here to chill amori, which is one of the most pcb core things I've seen in a while
02:28:45 It releases on christmas and it's on steam and I think it will be pretty good amori
02:28:51 It's it's like a it's like a oh, I've seen like rpg
02:28:56 Okay, I've seen um this around
02:28:59 Is this pcp core? I don't know. It's kind of like earthbound core or like yume niki core, which I feel like aligns with
02:29:08 PCP looks like yeah, I've seen it around and I thought it looked like it could be neat. Um, yeah
02:29:16 Okay, that's fair. He looks all right. I like come out because I'm always a big fan of interesting
02:29:22 Art bits here and there
02:29:24 I'm always a big fan of earthbound
02:29:27 Whenever I see whenever I see like a Kickstarter game
02:29:31 That's like, you know getting updated and like I just kind of start ignoring it because I'm like, you know
02:29:37 Maybe I'll hear about it when it's done in like four years
02:29:41 And until then I don't care
02:29:43 Spooky slow ghosts. Oh shit. There he is. There he is. Are you gonna sue?
02:29:50 Uh, no, I'm gonna sue for peace. I'm gonna give them money
02:29:54 Uh, uh, okay, uh, uh, okay, everyone. Uh, shut the fuck up. Uh, the next one is called, uh, the next upload is called
02:30:03 Everyone is fuda
02:30:05 three two one go
02:30:08 I've been thinking about my question is digi fuda and I've come to the realization
02:30:14 That penises are just inside out vaginas
02:30:18 We all have a vagina in us
02:30:20 And I guess because vaginas are disinverted penises, that's right
02:30:25 Then all girls just have penises inside them, which I guess means they're being raped assuming they don't want
02:30:32 Their own dicks inside them without their own content
02:30:35 But anyway, uh, I think that makes
02:30:39 Everyone a fuda girls are just constantly being fucked by themselves because their own penis is all up inside of their vagina
02:30:48 That's such a stupid like
02:30:50 Like it means nothing
02:30:53 I don't I think it's a joke. I know it's a joke and it made me and it made me laugh
02:30:57 So you know what it worked. Good job. I guess we know who is the philosophy major
02:31:03 Yeah, yeah sounds like me sounds just like me
02:31:08 Okay, that was great. Hey, love you. Next one is called voice voice grail. No voice grail. No contestant contestant
02:31:15 Okay, damn. Damn it. No, I'm not feeling it
02:31:19 Next one is called read theory libs. I'm excited for this one. Uh, this is gonna be good
02:31:25 This one's goes out to fucking michelle's put down your fuck put down your jordan peterson mary condo bullshit and pick up some fucking
02:31:32 Pick up das kapital
02:31:34 three two one go
02:31:40 Go on it's difficult for me to imagine what personal liberty is enjoyed by an unemployed hungry person
02:31:46 True freedom can only be where there is no exploitation
02:31:49 or oppression
02:31:51 Of one person by another where there is not unemployment and where a person is not living in fear of losing his job
02:31:57 His home and his bread
02:31:59 Only in such a society and in any other freedom can exist for real and not on paper
02:32:04 Is this from running your communist? That is from
02:32:07 probably economic terrorism and
02:32:09 the oil owners
02:32:11 uh april 21st 1908
02:32:14 By joseph fucking stallin
02:32:17 fucking based
02:32:19 Fucking just absolutely based. Yeah, amazing theory. I mean, yeah guys born in the 1800s
02:32:26 Rob's banks overthrows an evil king kills fucking nazis
02:32:30 Yep, creates space travel or well, you know sets up the organization that creates space travel
02:32:37 Wait, yeah, and it's what you're saying is stalling. It just blows my mind how fucking based it is
02:32:43 He'll edit you out of pictures though if he doesn't like you
02:32:46 Didn't yeah stallin
02:32:48 And hitler team up in that war
02:32:51 In the beginning they can't uh the relationship soured
02:32:56 Well, uh, nobody's perfect. What am I thinking? Yeah, no one's perfect
02:33:02 Look, we all make mistakes
02:33:05 I guess um, they did they did kill a lot of nazis though the soviet union did uh do a lot of that
02:33:10 Which is pretty basic. I think we need to yeah, we just need to like measure
02:33:14 Like and I mean, that's good theory. That's good theory. Well, uh, he was spitting straight facts there
02:33:20 You know, you can't you can't deny. It's like there's there's no way that this can exist without oppression
02:33:25 And that's the just the way I like it. You know, that's what they said theory
02:33:31 I don't think so
02:33:35 What are they what what did they say what did they say?
02:33:38 Well, they say nothing. Thanks for watching
02:33:42 Okay
02:33:44 There's a good way to wrap that one. Oh, that's that's his next challenge to nothing wrong. Dab, dab, dab
02:33:49 Matt's gonna do a new channel or it's gonna be hey guys. Welcome to theory to
02:33:54 political theory
02:33:56 Hey guys, welcome to theory theory where we talk about how you should kill your landlord
02:34:02 Is jeff gonna write on that channel too
02:34:05 Jeff Bezos
02:34:07 Oh
02:34:08 Ben yes
02:34:10 Cool. Can't wait to jeff write on game theory. I think he said so. Yeah. He has for a couple
02:34:16 At least yeah, that's pretty funny. Um, that's pretty funny. Uh, good for him
02:34:21 Uh, next one is called dat dag zag. Wait, wait, wait before we go on the next one. Oh, am I stupid?
02:34:28 Yeah, um with joseph stalin. Was I thinking of mousselini? Was I was I was I actually doing that mousselina is the mousselina
02:34:35 You know mousselini is the italian fascist. Yes, and he was with hitler and they were with japan and we were able to okay
02:34:41 Stalin is different man different man
02:34:44 Well, apparently I mean apparently they was he all right. I didn't I actually didn't know that
02:34:50 Now you're just stalin for time. I am
02:34:53 I just want to clarify because uh, I just want to make sure people know that i'm stupid and that we can move on
02:34:59 Okay, well, apparently you're smarter than me because I thought they
02:35:04 Never did that but apparently they did accidentally smart
02:35:08 Listen, anyone getting their theory from the pro cast in the air's podcast
02:35:12 Look, what did we say everything? What did we say before?
02:35:14 We're always right and we always have an opinion and you always have to listen to it
02:35:18 And you should always always always clip it and quote it out of context
02:35:23 And take it as fact
02:35:26 Maybe you guys should read some history books
02:35:29 Maybe you should clean your fucking room
02:35:33 Yeah
02:35:36 Next next one it's called dag zagals is coming for yo gummies
02:35:43 three two one go
02:35:46 Ben since you're so worried about people getting their student debt cancelled and subsidized by the taxpayer
02:35:52 Why don't you just go ahead and get yourself incorporated so you can get your stupid goddamn keto gummies?
02:35:59 Subsidized by the taxpayer because it only costs like 150 to 250 dollars to become incorporated
02:36:08 And after that you can write off literally everything related to your goddamn keto gummies
02:36:14 As an expense
02:36:16 And then you will also be forced to sell them so I could buy them and enjoy some of these delicious keto gummies
02:36:23 That you are allegedly producing like a mad scientist and also you need to write down everything
02:36:28 You're fucking morian
02:36:30 You dingus write down everything like a mad scientist like a mad alchemist
02:36:36 Attempting to turn lead into gold
02:36:40 It will be the newton
02:36:42 A key to go down last time don't worry
02:36:45 Just start writing it down turning a lead
02:36:46 Fucking slime corp and then a government office has to have documents about an actual business called slime corp
02:36:53 Water just do it so malt oligosaccharides
02:36:57 I some not yes, that's nice. Yes. I I some alt oligosaccharides aka. I am. Oh, that would be a really funny
02:37:04 Cool idea like if if ben like started a business literally called it slime corp and made keto gummies
02:37:13 Under a sliver just make the champion chapter two
02:37:16 Yeah, or maybe I could just do that
02:37:19 um, um, okay, I mean the thing like I all
02:37:23 Since I like have sort of tentative plans to maybe sell candy in the future
02:37:28 I'm already planning to write off all my gummy related expenses. Anyway, so like whatever. I don't I don't need to be incorporated for that
02:37:35 um
02:37:36 Uh
02:37:37 Other than that I actually have not been making the keto ones
02:37:40 I've just been off keto and I've just been making like sugar gummies
02:37:43 I like to the ones you shared on twitter recently the ones that look very opaque. They look good
02:37:48 Those ones came out really good
02:37:51 But and I and I and I part of me wants to try and replicate that recipe but
02:37:56 I made those with sugar
02:37:58 But I kind of think that maybe I should switch to using syrup like glucose syrup
02:38:02 I think it might result in a smoother product
02:38:06 Um, because those ones were pretty good
02:38:09 They were like 95 of the way there. I think switching to syrup might get me the last
02:38:15 The last way there. I don't know. Maybe you should quit comics and just make candy
02:38:20 That's like the opposite of what tectonic improv said
02:38:25 Yeah, please don't so one of you is wrong
02:38:29 And time will tell
02:38:31 Who do I shoot?
02:38:34 Whoever wins we lose
02:38:37 Next
02:38:38 Next one is called next one is oh next one is riddle my ass batman. He's back
02:38:43 He's back, baby. I'm honored to be on an episode riddle my ass batman
02:38:48 I had I had a funny exchange with riddle my ass batman in the comments on the last episode because riddle my ass batman had pledged to the vapor's two kickstarter
02:38:57 For like a lot. He had gotten like two signed copies, but he had never responded to the
02:39:02 Thing and I had messaged him on kickstarter and I never got a response
02:39:05 So he commented on the last episode. So I just replied to his comment being like, hey, what's what's your mailing address?
02:39:12 Like what's your like like what do you want on your doodles?
02:39:15 And he I didn't ask what I like I didn't expect him to reply there
02:39:18 But he replied there in the comments like with his mailing. Yes, he did
02:39:24 I I copied the the address and I removed the comments like because like okay
02:39:29 He said like oops, I did dox myself, but he didn't remove the comments. I had to do it
02:39:35 But I got it. I got the request so it's all good. That's good. Okay, three two one go
02:39:41 I know I'm someone who promises new voicemails a lot
02:39:46 But this time I promise and if I don't deliver you can cut off the end up
02:39:53 Ben sains dick and circumcise them. Okay
02:39:55 You're delivering it right now. There'll be a new voicemail series the quest for cold corona coming out speaking of cold corona first of this year
02:40:03 Now I already have all 26 episodes recorded. Oh my god written out. So I ought to do his record every week, you know
02:40:09 Not big deal. What I have to ask is I want to do a comic alongside it. Oh my god
02:40:14 The comic is not finished, but I think I can keep up with demands as I go
02:40:18 So should I do
02:40:20 One week of voicemails one week of comics or should I release all the comics?
02:40:24 in the first half of the year and then
02:40:27 The voicemail and first voicemails in the first half of the year and in the comics during the second half of the year
02:40:31 Thoughts discussion and there's a funny voicemail coming after this to whet your whistle. Okay
02:40:36 Same time same piece you can't I can't I can't believe it. I'm just gonna say this as a as a viewer
02:40:42 Slash us unfortunately a fan of the pro kresners podcast
02:40:47 Whatever you have planned riddle my ass batman is too good for this podcast. Just release it separately
02:40:54 I would say okay if if I would
02:40:59 I would say one of each
02:41:00 I would just say just if you've got if you've got
02:41:04 If you've got both just release one of each
02:41:06 Uh, it would be my recommendation. It sounds like way too much. I mean the voice mails would be like a good
02:41:12 Prompt to go look at the comic
02:41:14 If you have like another issue if that's that's true
02:41:17 So it'd be like, oh, we'll listen to the voicemail and then remind everyone to go look at the comic
02:41:22 I think that would work
02:41:23 Sounds like way too much effort for voicemail. I know you should just create actual contact
02:41:28 26 episodes
02:41:31 He's got them recorded already. He's basically making a show and we're the broadcast network
02:41:40 Yeah, that's basically it
02:41:43 That's that'd be 26 weeks
02:41:47 God
02:41:48 Damn
02:41:50 I
02:41:51 Get excited
02:41:53 It is too good for us. There's no question. There's no question
02:41:58 um
02:41:59 Yeah, I I like that. I like the idea that you released
02:42:03 Okay, I was assuming at first that like the comic and the voicemail were the same
02:42:07 Like it's a comic version of the voicemail in which case I would say release them together if they're separate things
02:42:14 Then yeah, I guess I guess still like just release one on your
02:42:19 Website or on tapas or wherever you're posting it and then we'll hear the voicemail and it'll be a
02:42:25 Reminder to check out the comic that yeah, that sounds reasonable
02:42:30 Let's let's hear. Let's hear the first one. Let's hear his fucking voicemail
02:42:33 The next one is also called riddle my ass batman. Here we go. Let our whistles
02:42:38 three two one go
02:42:40 As promised the funny voicemail now. I got I know you guys play dream stories and here's a good one
02:42:48 Uh, I was being raped by donatella. Oh my god
02:42:52 He's like, hey, man. They be sick of those tits and then uh, I was like, no donatella
02:42:57 No, am I you know like where my ass batman voice? I was like like I was really dreaming as sort of my ass batman
02:43:03 And then cold corona
02:43:05 came in and
02:43:06 He kicked donatella's ass joined in and then started raping him. So uh
02:43:13 That's calm. Yeah, and then I woke up. That's about all I have to say. Yeah. I uh, yeah
02:43:18 Got raped by cold corona because donatella's trying to rape me and cold corona's a hero and thank you. Thank you
02:43:23 Co-corona you uh saved me from dream rape
02:43:27 You're a hero. God bless. Thank god. Let's be my horseman. Okay. Thank you. See you time. Thank you. Bye
02:43:35 I'm so glad. So I have one big problem with this with this voicemail. Uh, the corona cannot be donatello
02:43:43 You don't think so. No, but he's the cutest and the strongest remember
02:43:47 He is the cutest and the strongest
02:43:49 That's true. That's true. Um, uh, I don't know
02:43:53 I mean
02:43:55 In a horse really beat a turtle. No, I think he could beat him
02:43:59 I think he could beat him if he got the upper hand if he got the drop on him
02:44:01 Like if donatello was in the middle of like a really choice rape
02:44:05 Uh that he was distracted enough by I think I think cold corona could use that to do his ambush tactics
02:44:11 You're right. It's not a fair fight. It's not a cold corona fights dirty
02:44:18 Not as dirty as donatello not as dirty as donatello, obviously
02:44:24 That's a good point. Remember my ass batman. I'm sorry that happened
02:44:28 Well, is this the dream?
02:44:31 I don't know, but you know, it's a nightmare. I guess it's this it's all you can say. It was a prophecy
02:44:37 I guess it did have a happy ending
02:44:39 He didn't that's true. That's true. God blesses everyone
02:44:44 um
02:44:45 Next voicemail is called poop balls lemal
02:44:50 I'm lovin this two
02:44:52 one
02:44:53 ago
02:44:57 Yes
02:45:00 I accept what was up with that life for some apology. Yes, but you
02:45:10 You resist I did I not forgive for that
02:45:15 Fuck you
02:45:17 So
02:45:21 I think I think that's the original man a person
02:45:25 Yeah, definitely. I just want to say the samurai is definitely my favorite
02:45:30 PCP voicemail character all the other all the other ones they're junk not a fan
02:45:35 But every single time there's this non sequitur email and it's like
02:45:39 Konnichiwa. I lose it. I just lose it. It's so good the samurai. Yeah, it's just it's it's it's half the voice
02:45:46 Right, like it's the the the the konnichiwa and the until next time is like, it's so satisfying
02:45:52 It's it's just whatever happens in between those two things is fine. Thank you
02:45:58 Well, he's thank you samurai. He's basically a member now, right?
02:46:02 Thank you for not forgiving me. I'm a little shocked that there's been no fan art of the samurai
02:46:07 Like he's he's been such a fixture
02:46:10 I guess there's been no like mention of any descriptive things. There's no items that you could have
02:46:16 He's just a samurai. Yeah
02:46:18 He's just a samurai and he and he scrolls. I guess he has scroll. Oh, yeah, he doesn't know. He doesn't have a scroll. That's right
02:46:25 That's distinctive, right? Like a samurai without a scroll like
02:46:29 Like I've never heard a subscriber character as being like like. Oh, yeah, and he doesn't have this
02:46:36 Okay, so so so look draw him being sad about the fact that he doesn't have something that and his hand is open
02:46:42 But there's nothing looking looking
02:46:44 Looking wistfully at his at at something
02:46:48 That is gone. He's got like an perfectly scroll shaped space on his shelf that is unfilled
02:46:55 That's his defining trait
02:46:59 Draw him. Oh, he's also got the necronomicon draw him on a computer without any scroll bars on his windows
02:47:06 Oh true
02:47:09 That that's that's the real Kawasaki scroll
02:47:12 The Kawasaki that's the technique is to scroll the web page real quick. Yeah scrolling on twitter
02:47:18 That's the Kawasaki scroll that ben saint stole
02:47:22 No, this is on twitter all the time the technique of going down the twitter feed
02:47:29 All right, I've heard enough of this nonsense
02:47:32 Uh, what next voicemail is called
02:47:37 That is another one. Oh, yeah, you
02:47:40 What you posted to but you haven't played the first no, I didn't

02:48:50 Oh, yeah, I know who you're talking about
02:48:53 Yeah, I have no idea what her name is. I don't know. I never actually looked into it
02:48:58 Okay, okay, good. I'm glad she's here though. It wouldn't be the same without her
02:49:02 Um
02:49:03 Next the next one is called the same joke again
02:49:07 Three two one go
02:49:09 Welcome back to the pro president's podcast. Yeah, let's hear it. Virginia
02:49:14 And I would like to say to our guest
02:49:17 Jar Jar Binks
02:49:19 I
02:49:20 I will respect you and your marketing genius and the and I love you and I respect you so much
02:49:26 Oh, you don't think you want Jar Jar Binks? Thank you so much
02:49:33 Next guys fucking hiv
02:49:37 Wow, I don't have retards on the podcast
02:49:39 Why don't you have a cwc on quite quite literally the most famous retard of full time?
02:49:44 Oh, come on. Why don't you have any on again?
02:49:49 I don't know where this is going. I don't really understand like like it's I guess it's funny
02:49:54 I feel like he's trying to make a point, but I don't know what that point is. I think the point is that
02:49:59 Well, I think he's making a point with the jar jar binks
02:50:02 Uh, but I don't think hiv. I feel like hiv was improv
02:50:10 Well, you know what they say everything is positive even hiv
02:50:14 Is is the point that we have bad guests. Does he not like our choice of guests? I don't think that's I think
02:50:20 with with the
02:50:22 um
02:50:22 Well, maybe it is but with the digi thing
02:50:25 I think it was just him making fun of how digi called moralogic and marketing genius
02:50:29 Oh
02:50:31 By the way, that was good
02:50:32 I'm I missed that it was even about that that one was digi. Okay. Yeah, he did say digi at the beginning
02:50:38 marketing marketing genius lamal
02:50:41 Uh, okay. All right. Whatever fucking great. Uh, next one is called. Uh, you have to have moralogic back on
02:50:49 You have to three two one go
02:50:53 Holy shit, holy shit, you guys I remember this guy from back when he went by sato asami the first time he got banned from funny junk
02:51:00 Like yeah, no, I haven't even scratched the surface here. Like not only did he get fired from his job
02:51:05 He he got fucking disowned from his family over this shit like for real
02:51:10 I don't think I'm realizing this is like a prime law cow you have right here
02:51:15 Oh, well, I don't think he'll come back, right? Oh, he'll come back. He's desperate for attention, but like I don't know
02:51:21 What it I guess we okay
02:51:24 Go on go on. I I gotta say like I was listening to the podcast and like it was it was funny
02:51:29 It was funny the stuff he was saying until it wasn't but um, yeah, but I I got upset when he started making fun of janitors
02:51:38 Not like the forum moderator janitors, but the real life janitors because yeah yours truly
02:51:45 Is a janitor. No shit. Yeah, that's right. I think I I I heard that mentioned on twitter
02:51:51 I clean I clean schools. I clean them. That's that's fucked up. So
02:51:56 So here I am. You do you do it for free. You do it for free. I don't do it for free
02:52:00 I do it for money, but it's it's funny because I'm like cleaning light shields or whatever
02:52:05 And they just start shitting on janitors about how their lowest job ever. I'm like
02:52:10 Ah, now you made a personal mere logic
02:52:12 I'm pissed. I'm pissed. It's not fun of janitors in that way is like
02:52:17 It's like what are you doing? He hasn't worked very much
02:52:21 Just like normal like labor
02:52:23 Doesn't understand he doesn't respect it like you should because it's it's difficult and people need to do it
02:52:30 I don't think that mere logic
02:52:33 Likes us very much. I don't think he will like us very much anymore
02:52:36 But maybe we could get him maybe he would come back on to like defend like to argue against us to like defend himself
02:52:44 Maybe we could maybe we could finagle that
02:52:46 I think it'd be funny if we everything if we frame it the right way. We could make it happen
02:52:50 I mean, I don't hate my logic. I just think there's I could be uh
02:52:53 Yeah, if I could be on an episode with on him, there would there would be kind of funny
02:52:58 I want to play gamer's tower versus mere logic. There's I get I think just those two
02:53:03 just
02:53:06 The battle battle of the century
02:53:08 um
02:53:09 You know, there was a lot of
02:53:11 Honestly, there was a lot of anti-mer logic sentiment going around in the comments
02:53:15 But in my opinion in my opinion, he was a worthwhile guest. He was pretty funny
02:53:19 Yeah, and I wouldn't I wouldn't be opposed to to a to a round around to
02:53:24 uh, maybe
02:53:26 um
02:53:27 Next one is called
02:53:30 Next one is called red five rainbow
02:53:33 I know them three two one go
02:53:36 Hey, uh, just calling in to let you guys know that you might be able to get dream as a guest on the pcp
02:53:41 Since you have a connection to him through fit
02:53:44 since
02:53:45 dream knows fit because
02:53:47 It is in the challenging 25 youtubers to a fight for a $5,000 video on his second channel. So
02:53:54 I don't know. Maybe dream as a guest would be cool. Um
02:53:59 It's it's funny that this voicemail comes in
02:54:02 I'm I'm new to this but dream is like some minecraft youtuber. So I assume that's how fit mc knows him
02:54:08 But um, there was actually something that came out recently about this guy that he apparently
02:54:13 Like cheated or something to get uh to get like some sort of minecraft world record
02:54:18 I saw a video that was titled like our dreams
02:54:23 Like speedruns cheated
02:54:25 Yeah
02:54:27 And I didn't watch it and like I don't I know that dream is like some guy who has become really famous like very recently
02:54:35 I guess he's blown up in like the last few months and other than that
02:54:39 I just know that he's a guy who's become famous recently and he does minecraft stuff. Um
02:54:44 Uh
02:54:46 This is that just what a coincidence though
02:54:51 Yeah, I don't I don't I don't know anything about honestly
02:54:55 For me. Yeah, it would probably be good and like a box office draw to get dream on the podcast
02:55:01 He's got a lot of subscribers. I think he has like over a million
02:55:05 But I don't know who he is
02:55:08 And I don't
02:55:10 Know what I would care to even discuss with him. I don't I don't know uh, maybe
02:55:15 Sounds hard and I don't know what I'm gonna do it. You gotta chase the numbers, Ben
02:55:19 Oh, I don't that guy. I know his uh, I think I've seen one of his videos before
02:55:25 Frankly, I'm not motivated to make it happen
02:55:28 Frankly, frankly, I don't know if I give a shit. I know uh fit mc, but I never heard of dream
02:55:34 They he's kind of new
02:55:36 But I do have dreams video I watched was like I'm playing minecraft and um, there's a there's like every time I get hit
02:55:44 Everyone else in the server like gets launched a hundred blocks in the air and then they fall
02:55:50 And and that's the gimmick of the episode and there's other ones where he's like
02:55:53 His friends are trying to kill him or like the world is crumbling and he's only got a few minutes to like try and beat minecraft
02:55:59 Just like little little things like that
02:56:01 comedy
02:56:03 Cool, so what you're telling me is uh, if I want to get a lot of subscribers, I need to play minecraft, right?
02:56:11 Yeah, I mean to be I mean to be honest. I didn't know who fit mc was either until he came on
02:56:17 And then I was like, okay. Well, it's a whole it's it's a section of youtube like there's lots of
02:56:22 There's lots of sections of youtube that are like
02:56:25 Um cut off from others, but
02:56:29 Some of them have larger audiences than others
02:56:32 Yeah, sure. So like educational channels generally do very well
02:56:37 Overall because it's just like interesting things like minecraft work with with zoomers a lot
02:56:44 But not necessarily for
02:56:46 Uh people who don't play minecraft all the time
02:56:49 No, shit
02:56:52 Just just you know, just my insight as a you know kidding. Is that is that a fact?
02:56:58 Did you know? Yeah
02:57:01 Just a theory, uh, all right next voicemail is called sucking dick in the street three two one go
02:57:09 Benjamin, I love you and they're my best friends, but I have something to tell you that I think my offender
02:57:14 Yeah, I think the over publicization and the overexposure to social matters of lately is probably one of the causes
02:57:21 To the creative crisis that you've been describing for many episodes now
02:57:26 I think this idea that you have to create art that's both relevant and conforming to the
02:57:32 Small window of the world that you've been consuming
02:57:35 I think it's a stupid idea and it's probably creating an unachievable goal
02:57:40 for you with your art
02:57:42 And poisoning you well and I think the stupid damn
02:57:47 I think I think wait wait. It's not done. I seek help seek help
02:57:51 Damn, that's that's a real show knows this though
02:57:55 Explain
02:57:56 Well, like that social media sucks. Is that what he's like saying or that way you're saying specifically
02:58:03 Like he's been saying usage of social media is the reason he's got creative drought or whatever
02:58:08 He's saying it specifically in reference to me in reference to the the way that I've been talking about stuff. Yeah
02:58:15 Need to seek help from twitter
02:58:17 Yeah, yeah, like the the whole like oh get off twitter, bro
02:58:22 It's like I think I think
02:58:24 You know that then
02:58:27 It's it's just like. Yeah
02:58:29 I don't know. He said then done. I suppose it's I I understand. I feel a sense that in the abstract
02:58:37 My attention is not where it needs to be in order for me to be productive
02:58:44 but I don't
02:58:47 I lack I don't have like a clear like sense of like
02:58:52 Instead of what instead of me focusing on this I should be focusing on this
02:58:57 Uh, I don't have like a clear idea of like what?
02:59:01 I know I should be like making stuff, but like what?
02:59:05 What exactly should I be focused on? I don't know, you know to this
02:59:08 I actually just last night I started in on the on a big project that I've been meaning to start in on for a long time
02:59:15 Uh, and it was kind of fun getting started on that. Um, so maybe maybe maybe things are gonna turn around for me
02:59:21 I want to uh, uh really focus on that for a little while. Uh, so I guess
02:59:26 I I just think this guy's right. I think this guy's right and I know it
02:59:30 And I think he's right too
02:59:32 Yeah, I I think I guess my problem is just that is just like the a lot of people will like say stuff like this as if they're like
02:59:40 giving you
02:59:41 Uh new info not you in particular, but just like in general. Yeah, I think well, I feel like it's it's worth saying
02:59:49 in
02:59:50 Just to remind someone because like even if they say it to themselves hearing it from the outsides is like
02:59:55 It's a little extra motivation to actually think about changing something
03:00:00 It felt it felt personal enough to me that it didn't just feel like some some like some general like
03:00:07 General knowledge bullshit
03:00:10 Oh one thing's for sure. I have been I have been describing a sort of specific crisis
03:00:15 Uh, recently for sure and getting into fights on twitter is a complete waste of time
03:00:22 I will probably never quit that entirely
03:00:26 It's about it's about moderation everything in moderation
03:00:32 I mean, I do like how like curt you've become instead of like
03:00:36 Like I see your applies to people and and you're like, uh gross stupid like idiot
03:00:42 Like you just kind of fight and and they don't really start a response because of how like
03:00:49 I don't I don't really say anything but you do let them know that what they said was stupid
03:00:54 When a tweet makes me really angry
03:00:56 The last thing I want to do is give them a reason to like continue to say what they think
03:01:03 So like to me the obvious play. Yeah is to say something
03:01:07 Say something that is that is dismissive that that diminishes what they've said
03:01:12 That leaves them no room for like a serious like discussion or rebuttal to me
03:01:17 Uh, uh and and just lets me feel
03:01:21 Let's me feel as though I have harmed them in some way even if it's insignificant
03:01:25 Uh, that's all that's all I want out of a twitter fight and that's the easiest way to get it
03:01:30 It's literally like so on the on the on the quickie. I remember reading
03:01:34 I was reading the quickie years ago and and it just described um a trend
03:01:39 in which like as sonichu goes on the like
03:01:43 The the series starts with villains that are like more
03:01:47 sort of fictional
03:01:49 And you know the the characters have like continuing battles against them
03:01:53 But like later on
03:01:54 Chris starts to introduce these real life people these real life trolls as antagonists
03:01:59 And as the story goes on the conflicts with these antagonists
03:02:03 They actually become shorter and less climactic
03:02:06 because
03:02:08 Do you do you know where i'm going? Have I said this before? I don't think yeah
03:02:12 Are you are you going to like
03:02:14 She was inspired by real life events. That's what she was taking them from
03:02:19 Near the end
03:02:20 Is that where this is going?
03:02:21 No, the the the the reason posited in this quickie article and it sounds true to me
03:02:27 Is that the the battles against these real life antagonists become shorter and less climactic because
03:02:34 chris
03:02:35 Genuinely hates them and feels genuine anger and wants to use their presence in the comic not as like
03:02:43 A narrative beat for drama
03:02:45 But because chris needs to just defeat them
03:02:48 Like you know in a way that is as final and as
03:02:51 And as and as you know serious and as indisputable as she can
03:02:56 She just wants to feel that this person is dead and destroyed and to let her audience know
03:03:00 I have won this person is lost. They are gone. They are nothing to me
03:03:03 Which is why someone like ian brandon anderson will show up for exactly one panel
03:03:08 Before sonichu just will utterly obliterate him in a single blow and then he gets dragged down to hell by trolls
03:03:13 And that's the last you ever hear of him because that was like such a serious conflict that it was like
03:03:18 There's no fun and games here. There's no this is not like a ha ha. This is a villain like oh, we're rivals with each other
03:03:23 No, fuck this person. I kill them. That's what needs to happen. The monsters and that's how I feel
03:03:31 When I see some dipshit on twitter say, uh, I don't know
03:03:38 Whatever I don't know man. This uh, this sounds kind of like school shooter talk to me
03:03:43 You sound kind of like school shooter talk to me
03:03:47 I should shoot you for saying something like that
03:03:50 I could shoot you
03:03:57 Next voicemail are we done? How many more do we have?
03:04:00 Only like four I think four or five cool. We're getting there. Um
03:04:08 Next one is called mr. Miracle. Wait, why wait, why was that last one called sucking dick in the street?
03:04:13 I
03:04:15 It's evocative against the people going. It's true. It drew my eye. Okay. This one's called mr. Miracle three two one go
03:04:23 Hey, Ben, I have a comic book recommendation for you
03:04:26 It's called Mr. Miracle by Tom King. Tom King is one of the biggest names on mainstream comics right now
03:04:31 And mr. Miracle is a DC comic character created by Jack Kirby a huge visionary
03:04:37 She's made freedom mention him on the last episode
03:04:40 But you don't really need to know anything about DC comics continuity to to get into it
03:04:44 It reminds me of the champion that you mentioned you were interested in writing again has sort of
03:04:51 some thematically
03:04:53 Some similarities it's about this guy who's a literal champion from this cosmic kingdom
03:05:00 But um, it has a lot of emotional depth to it and and the art I think is pretty good
03:05:05 I think you might might like
03:05:08 Give it like a
03:05:09 seven out of ten
03:05:11 Look look it up
03:05:12 Seven out of ten would you recommend the seven out of ten? I guess I have before
03:05:18 um
03:05:19 You know numbers are very hard to know what they mean true
03:05:23 If it's like seven out of ten in general, but I think this person would really appreciate what's good about it
03:05:29 Maybe yeah, all right. Yeah fair enough
03:05:32 I've never heard of this though
03:05:34 I've heard of mr. Miracle. I know absolutely nothing about him. Yeah, I guess he's a super escape artist
03:05:41 This is like his power. Oh like Houdini
03:05:45 Or like chris angel mind freak
03:05:48 Powers and abilities like all the new gods scott free is function. I guess his name is scott free is functionally immortal
03:05:56 Uh, superhuman strength ability reflects a stamina
03:06:00 resistance to blah blah blah blah
03:06:03 Genius level intellect
03:06:05 Oh, he was he was trained
03:06:07 This this fucking sentence scott was trained by granny goodness as an arrow trooper
03:06:15 Well, you know, he's he's a man for the job
03:06:17 I'm not that into comics, but I can never take me like granny goodness seriously whenever she'd show up in like the
03:06:24 Justice League cartoon or whatever. I'd be like
03:06:27 We really using we're really using someone called granny goodness. I take I take gorilla grot over her
03:06:34 Wait, is he a
03:06:35 Okay, he's a good guy. Why was he trained by yeah, he might have defected is granny goodness is a bad guy
03:06:42 bad girl
03:06:44 Sure, um
03:06:46 Everyone any anyone can be a bad guy
03:06:49 Bad guy is gender neutral like uh like billie eilish
03:06:54 Yeah, exactly eilish is gender neutral
03:06:58 And and so are and so and so uh
03:07:03 Are you dear viewer?
03:07:05 It's we should get we should get billie eilish from the pcp
03:07:08 I agree and that would be great
03:07:11 I'm sure oblivion fall knows her
03:07:15 Wait, why?
03:07:16 Yeah, uh, he does like music, right? Everyone in music knows each other. Oh, that's small
03:07:21 It's small in small world small world
03:07:24 I picked up a guitar and I already I instantly had ringo star's phone number
03:07:29 It was recent love the back love
03:07:32 peace and wolf
03:07:33 This ringo star wrote every wrote his number on every guitar in the world because it's like if you're doing this
03:07:38 He wants to get to know what you what you're about. It's like call me. It's like that story of um of jack white
03:07:46 Hiding like records of unreleased demos and used furniture. He gives away
03:07:50 Just like a true by the way
03:07:55 Honestly that I have I that voicemail and the
03:08:00 Wikipedia article has given me like no sense at all of what mr. Miracle is
03:08:05 He might be talking about a specific run
03:08:07 Like a recent run by um by tom he did say I think is what he said
03:08:13 He said um, he said tom, um
03:08:17 Uh, yeah, tom king. Okay. All right. Well
03:08:21 I probably should check it out, but I I don't know if I'm going to cheesy probably knows something about it
03:08:28 Maybe he would maybe he would
03:08:30 um, all right next voicemail is uh called um, what is it called? It is called
03:08:37 Mr. Miracle 2 big barda
03:08:40 I know from the wikipedia article that big barda is mr. Miracle's wife. So
03:08:45 That's context. I think big barda is also linkara's favorite comic book character
03:08:50 Really, I think so. Yeah, it all comes back. It all comes full circle
03:08:55 Uh, three two one go
03:08:58 So just one more two details that could convince me to read the comic. Um
03:09:02 One tom king's a huge lefty. He is an ex-military but has no love for that bullshit. That's cool. And um
03:09:09 It features one the sexist woman on comics. Um big barda. She's like a huge amazon lady who has big tits and big s
03:09:18 And now you have my attention and give google her to big barda. I'm gonna school. I'm gonna google it and she's
03:09:25 Mr. Miracle's wife. So she's the whole comic
03:09:29 I do I do not believe you're fucking cool. I do not believe for us. I do not believe for a second
03:09:35 When I have to read it
03:09:37 I do not believe for a second that a woman who first appeared in a silver age comic book
03:09:42 I would ever find them hot. I think it's impossible
03:09:45 But I'm gonna google it and let's let's find out shall. What was her name? I think I get what you're saying big barda
03:09:51 Big barda
03:09:56 No, what is this? What the fuck is this? What the fuck?
03:10:04 What the fuck I don't get it what?
03:10:07 What is good? What is appealing about this at all? She looks like she's got a fucking like
03:10:12 Feet
03:10:13 Pharaoh's helmet. She's looking like full body armor and just like a girl with a face
03:10:18 What the fuck?
03:10:20 She's literally just a girl with a face
03:10:23 What there's just a lot of different iterations. I don't know which one he's talking about
03:10:28 I mean, they're all they're all the same. Well, I personally
03:10:31 She's wearing a suit of armor. This sucks. I prefer my girl's not to have faces
03:10:35 I
03:10:39 Cannot understand I cannot understand why you would look at this and be like, uh
03:10:44 Uh, this this girl who looks literally the same as every other girl
03:10:50 Except
03:10:51 She's wearing armor. Look, there she is. She's not wearing armor. She's she's just tall. I guess
03:10:57 Oh, wow, it's a girl with a face
03:11:00 This sucks. She looks pretty good. No, no fuck this comic. No fuck mr. Miracle
03:11:05 I miss you
03:11:07 Miracle, this is my perfect excuse that I needed not to read it. I can pretend to be outraged about this
03:11:15 Uh
03:11:17 No, this is tecno tonic. Are you gone? Wait a minute tectonic said he'd be back. Um, but he said go on without him
03:11:25 Okay, wait, what the fuck hold on. I just found this on google and I just want to show you
03:11:35 That's fucked up
03:11:37 This is fucked up superman in a porno. They're gonna fuck they're gonna fuck for money
03:11:44 Pretty cool. Uh, I wonder what the context is for this one. Do you think if superman has sex that his, uh
03:11:52 Pee-pee jizz would go zap and kill
03:11:55 Listen, listen, you listen you stupid motherfucker. Obviously
03:12:00 Of course
03:12:02 Um, didn't didn't superman get lois lane pregnant in one
03:12:07 iteration
03:12:08 And I've heard people say that like obviously it's impossible because like super sperm should be like stronger than steel
03:12:14 And she just like obliterate her uterus, right? She just like the sperm should just tunnel through her body and like fill her with a
03:12:21 Micro it's easy. All he needs to do is do it at an extreme distance. So the air is
03:12:25 Resistance will slow it down to the point
03:12:28 Where it will not kill her. So she's like 40 like 40 miles down the road and he goes
03:12:35 Wait, can't he just have kryptonite around him?
03:12:39 Yeah, he could just wear like red kryptonite or whatever. Uh, autoerotic kryptonation
03:12:47 I think it's red kryptonite. I think it's a red kryptonite that doesn't hurt him
03:12:52 But just like kind of turns him normal. So just use that
03:12:55 That's what you need. It's like honestly
03:12:58 I kind of think that there might be like an in now that I say that I'm thinking that maybe there is like an in-universe
03:13:04 iteration of superman where he does get lois lane pregnant and he only manages to do it by the use of red kryptonite
03:13:10 Yeah, I could be like hallucinating this right now. That's his like j.o. Crystal
03:13:15 No
03:13:16 Yeah, exactly
03:13:19 Okay, all right. All right. This is this is fucking this is degenerate. This is degenerate is what this is
03:13:25 um, next one
03:13:28 Where are the chibi bakas you baka faced horse scrotum?
03:13:33 three
03:13:33 Wait, there you go. Three two one go
03:13:37 Yo gib
03:13:39 You said like a billion episodes ago that you and monk. She did a cure a chibi bakas episode
03:13:46 No, you never released it. I never did what happened. Where's the chibi bakas?
03:13:52 Where's the chibi bakas gibbon? Where's the bloody I'd love to see it
03:13:58 I I I oh
03:14:00 I love to watch chibi bakas on me on metelli is well between sweet and chimneys
03:14:11 We got a nerve struck a nerve have I know it's just really really bad. Um
03:14:17 Um
03:14:18 Too close to home too close to home too close. It's just from my flashbacks to my literal everyday life
03:14:25 This is just
03:14:29 Everything sucks about the uk the vat tax is out of this world and everyone sounds like that
03:14:35 um chibi bakas is is is sort of like
03:14:38 On like permanent hiatus, which is to say that there's no plans to ever make an episode again
03:14:43 But I did say that I recorded that
03:14:46 Yeah, I've looked at the footage before and it was just like not very interesting and kind of like lame and I don't like it
03:14:54 Wait, what you mean like the audio?
03:14:57 Well, I recorded it in video form and audio
03:15:00 Um, because we because munchy was literally there. It's like oh, it's chibi bakas live
03:15:05 Wait, was that for was that ragcon four? No, that was when munchy came over to stay in my house
03:15:10 Right, right, right, right. I mean the the discussion just will release it
03:15:15 Well, the thing is I have to edit it because it sucks and it's like we don't really have much to say
03:15:21 I was just like that was weird wasn't it? Yeah, if I had weird
03:15:24 I think people would appreciate it. I don't know. I don't know. I can tell you what to do
03:15:27 But like I think it would it's it's probably it's probably worth posting
03:15:33 Okay, I'm I'll think about it. I'll have to I've remind I was hoping everyone would have forgotten
03:15:38 But there's one guy he's fucking ruined my plan
03:15:43 If you already have the footage you may as well release it
03:15:46 But I don't want it to be cringe. I gotta un-cringe it for it. It's too late. It's too late
03:15:51 I gotta I gotta up the contrast mac
03:15:56 The thing about that is not releasing it is even more cringe by definition. You're really damned if you do damned if you don't
03:16:04 Maybe
03:16:06 Maybe maybe I won't be cringe, you know, maybe maybe I don't know. I doubt it
03:16:11 uh
03:16:12 Next one is called um make pcp wholesome again safe place. Oh wait, I didn't put it in the chat. Um
03:16:20 There it is make pcp wholesome again safe place three two one go
03:16:26 Guys there's nothing healthy wrong with being a talk
03:16:30 Oh, no, if a black man has exude your wife for instance
03:16:33 Why not been a little more inclusive, you know, I'm progressive
03:16:37 I think that he's a young
03:16:39 masculine
03:16:40 brave man
03:16:41 And he's doing great for this podcast and for our community. So people, please
03:16:47 Stop making fun of ben sainte
03:16:50 You should know better
03:16:53 It's always you
03:16:54 Thank you
03:16:56 Yeah, you're the butt of every joke ben
03:16:58 That's what what did I say? Who was the guy who left the podcast and everyone was glad he was gone that I compared myself to
03:17:06 Uh greg from completionist
03:17:09 Yeah, lemal. I don't know. Oh, yeah, that guy. I like that. He sounds like he's
03:17:14 He's like talking in front of a huge audience like the echo it makes it seem like he he's doing like some sort of state of the union or whatever about
03:17:23 It being okay that you're a cock
03:17:26 Didn't uh maddox do that one time
03:17:30 He did for a second. I I thought that was a thought
03:17:33 This was a maddox thing, but no
03:17:36 Yeah, but when maddox defended cucks he like
03:17:39 It's like he thought that the only
03:17:42 Meaning that the word had was that you were like a cuck fetishist
03:17:47 And he didn't like
03:17:49 He didn't read no, no, there's nothing wrong with being a cuck's like it's just a fetish. He missed the point
03:17:53 He missed he didn't read the room. I guess. Yeah. Yeah on that one
03:17:59 No, we're just sort of maybe it's one of those language
03:18:03 purists whereas like if it was
03:18:05 Language can't change if people use it differently. It has a definition a word
03:18:08 A word can't have more than one meaning in different contexts. This is so stupid
03:18:15 uh
03:18:16 Next next one is called cross
03:18:19 Uh important question
03:18:21 Three two one go
03:18:25 What is your favorite font and why?
03:18:28 Uh, comic for the uh, no, um, I guess courier because it's the the font that homestuck has I think
03:18:35 Ah, that's the that's the typewriter font
03:18:38 Yeah, courier courier new
03:18:41 Yeah, that's a good one
03:18:43 Well, the the font I use on my website is uh aerial I think
03:18:48 I
03:18:49 I classic there's a font in um in sony vegas
03:18:53 Called, uh, I think it's called bond shrift condensed bold or something
03:18:58 It's I can only find it in vegas like I try to use it other places and I can't find it anywhere. Let me
03:19:05 Let me see get it. I mean, I I will say, you know, everybody knows that I love, um, showcard gothic
03:19:11 Yes, everyone knows about the showcard gothic and that's a that's a big one
03:19:15 Um, great font that I never hear anyone talk about is ukari mobile
03:19:20 ukari mobile is a super good font and which I found
03:19:24 Uh, because it was the font that they used in the promo materials for fighting is magic
03:19:30 The the the game that would go on to become, uh, them's fighting who herds them's fighting herds classic. Oh, yeah
03:19:38 Um, that's a super good, uh
03:19:42 There's one called there's one I use all the time called trash type dk
03:19:47 Um, which looks it looks like courier, but it's all like messy and fucked up and like grungy looking that one's like
03:19:52 I love that one
03:19:56 What else to it as a kid my favorite font was sylphane
03:19:59 Because sylphane looks like times new roman, but it is slightly bigger and therefore if you write your essays in it
03:20:05 You can get away with writing that
03:20:08 Yeah
03:20:09 uh
03:20:10 I like
03:20:11 I like all the fonts from pokemon games. I use those a lot when I want to use like some like
03:20:17 Computer looking texts. I like the um the cave story font too. That one's nice
03:20:23 There's too many fonts to keep track of I have no idea
03:20:27 Uh, riveting uh riveting a font commentary
03:20:32 I mean there's a font of discussion people are interested in people are definitely interested in fonts
03:20:36 And I am one of the gamers who is who who has like
03:20:40 I don't know difficulty
03:20:42 Remembering fonts or like distinguishing them. I mean, there's so fucking many
03:20:46 There's so fucking many but I've always felt like people are always like into something about fonts
03:20:52 And I just my brain just doesn't perceive them in the same way fonts are interesting
03:20:58 Because they're like a thing that everyone is oh, I just
03:21:02 A bit of an outstretched pick but uh karima
03:21:05 Karima is the font that andrew hussey used to like it's the font that like the title of like planets appears in in homestuck like
03:21:14 Durs and prospit and like land of wind and shade
03:21:17 Is karima and uh karima is pretty cool. Um
03:21:21 Uh
03:21:22 Fonts are like a thing that like you see everywhere and probably for a lot of your life
03:21:27 You don't even like think about or question at all
03:21:29 And then when you when you discover that like these things have names and like people design them
03:21:34 And like they come from somewhere and there's all these things to consider about them
03:21:37 that like uh that you'd never even thought about like spacing and and kerning and and um
03:21:43 Serifs and and all that shit and it's like a whole rabbit hole
03:21:47 That was like right in front of you the whole time. Yeah, and you never even thought about it
03:21:51 That's what that's what's interesting about fonts to me. I like I like wolf
03:21:55 uh fonts
03:21:57 wolf
03:21:59 Yeah, wolf peck is a band that I like and the the leader of the band is also very into fonts and he's made a font
03:22:06 Um that he uses in all his youtube videos
03:22:09 And he's very like knowledgeable in all the different aspects of font design
03:22:14 I see and it looks nice
03:22:17 I see I think it may be a series of fonts. I can't remember
03:22:21 well
03:22:22 Oh, I have I have one
03:22:24 That I used in the champion that I thought was pretty nice called knight warrior
03:22:28 um
03:22:29 That's just kind of a fancy looking one that I think is this is nice
03:22:33 Oh, yeah, this is this is a funny kind of gothic
03:22:37 This jack stratton leader of wolf records doing a font video. He's funny
03:22:44 He's a funny guy
03:22:46 Font calculus
03:22:48 Tectonic, what did you what did you post the um the my name is tectonic improv video for oh, that's that's um
03:22:54 The title is the bond shrift condensed. Oh
03:22:58 Oh, yeah
03:22:59 I remember when I when I started making videos. I was like I need a font
03:23:03 So I just kept testing out fonts and videos and I eventually found this one. I was like this one's cool
03:23:08 Don't take this the wrong way. Were you inspired by digi being really into blue highway?
03:23:15 No, what what font is that is is that close to this one?
03:23:20 I
03:23:22 No, I mean sort of but not really no just I remember digi was like very for a while
03:23:28 She was like
03:23:29 Blue highway was the font she would always use in all of her videos. Oh, you mean just like having a font
03:23:35 Yeah, just having like a font. That's like your font. I'm sure I'm sure I was inspired in some way
03:23:40 Yeah, I remember her talking about that and I thought like that's a good idea that makes sense
03:23:45 um
03:23:46 She's not like she invented the concept or anything, but yeah
03:23:50 Uh
03:23:52 All right, anything anything else to say about fonts uh guys or shall we please watch that wolf sans video?
