00:00:00 It's time for another PCP interview! It's been God knows how long since the last one, I don't remember.
00:00:06 Like a year and a half at least, right?
00:00:08 Yeah, they were all done relatively within a reasonable time frame of each other, and they're not ever again.
00:00:14 And then I think Nate and Mumkey had one, but now it's your turn.
00:00:19 Yes.
00:00:20 And you're fucking who are you, motherfucker?
00:00:23 I'm Tom Oliver, and I do 3D stuff mostly now.
00:00:29 Tommy Oliver Says.
00:00:31 On Twitter.
00:00:32 Tommy Oliver Blogs.
00:00:33 On The Tumblr.
00:00:34 Tommy Oliver, what's your Instagram?
00:00:36 It's PaulieState2.
00:00:38 Yeah.
00:00:39 And then YouTube is Tommy Oliver Says.
00:00:43 C slash Tommy Oliver Says.
00:00:45 Anything happening on Facebook?
00:00:47 Not yet, but I'm definitely gonna move there eventually.
00:00:51 I consider you sort of like, the reason that I think you're like a very underappreciated valuable asset to the PCP in a backroom sense that maybe even viewers wouldn't appreciate is that you know social media,
00:01:06 like you know what's big, you know what's hot, you know tech, why? Why don't you know all this shit?
00:01:13 I'm just really interested in it. I've just been interested in technology for my entire life.
00:01:19 Like being a little kid when I was like, I got a Game Boy for the first time and like, can I make this do anything else besides play games?
00:01:26 Like I was just really fascinated.
00:01:28 Like I'm like, I'm super addicted to cell phones, but I wanted a cell phone before cell phones existed.
00:01:34 Like I was the kid in like seventh grade who had no like actual life, but got a PDA.
00:01:38 Just thought it was cool to have a computer in my pocket.
00:01:40 So everyone else, like everyone else was listening to iPods and stuff and I got a PDA and like got an SD card and put music on that,
00:01:46 but also like could play little video games and could do like things.
00:01:50 And I was like, super interested in like the Dell Pocket PCs.
00:01:52 They had like the little Wi-Fi dongle you could plug in and shit.
00:01:55 This is so cool.
00:01:56 Did you actually use your PDA to do like playing, like planner shit?
00:02:00 Like did you actually keep schedule on it?
00:02:02 I mean, I didn't have a schedule, but if I did, I would have put it in there.
00:02:06 Cause I, I never went for anything like that cause I am so bad at like,
00:02:11 I love writing in a planner, but I never look back at it.
00:02:15 You know what I mean?
00:02:16 Like I love writing a list of what I'm going to do today and then I never look at it.
00:02:20 When I do it though, it's super effective.
00:02:22 Oh my God, it can be.
00:02:24 If you fucking, like if you have scheduled time for videos and stuff and you can like pre-produce them ahead of time, that's like a huge boost.
00:02:30 My big thing, my hardest thing with production is that I can't start.
00:02:35 As soon as I start, I get in the rhythm and I'm fine.
00:02:37 But I will like sit for like four hours and be like, should I do something?
00:02:41 Oh yeah, that's the hardest.
00:02:42 I mean, once you're in it, the only thing that's going to push you out is if like,
00:02:47 you feel like this particular section is really soulless and you wish it wasn't even in your video, you know?
00:02:53 Like when you have those moments where you listen to a sentence and you're like,
00:02:57 there is no way to make this creative and fun to watch that I am capable of.
00:03:02 So I guess it's just going to be 30 seconds of footage from whatever show is relevant.
00:03:08 And that's when you want to get up and take a break and go outside and, you know.
00:03:13 Not exist anymore.
00:03:14 Exactly.
00:03:15 That's me for the entire editing process start to finish.
00:03:18 Because as soon as I get to that point, like I've been doing the Y3D anime fail series.
00:03:23 I did the first two.
00:03:25 It's been written out since, I want to say maybe August of last year.
00:03:31 I have like this huge document.
00:03:32 You read it.
00:03:33 You read the whole thing pretty much.
00:03:34 I sent it to you like a year ago.
00:03:36 Which document?
00:03:37 The Y3D anime fails like for each.
00:03:39 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:03:40 That long ago?
00:03:41 It was a long time ago.
00:03:42 Oh fuck.
00:03:43 I didn't feel like that long ago.
00:03:44 Yeah.
00:03:45 And it just sits there because I don't want to edit it.
00:03:51 Yeah.
00:03:55 That video series.
00:03:57 What, how hopeful were you that that was going to be like a huge hit?
00:04:02 That one in particular, I didn't think was going to be huge.
00:04:04 I thought it was going to do way better than it did.
00:04:06 Yeah, I thought so too.
00:04:07 And I think that the only reason it didn't was like just, just didn't get spread around
00:04:14 enough.
00:04:15 And I honestly like, I kind of wished you had just made it one big video.
00:04:19 I mean, it probably just never would have gotten done if that had been the case.
00:04:22 Yeah, I'd still be working on it.
00:04:23 But like.
00:04:24 Originally it was going to just be one big video.
00:04:25 Yeah.
00:04:26 But I think the issue is that like because it's in smaller parts, people were like interested
00:04:29 but wanted to know more and then it took a long time before they learned anymore.
00:04:33 Here's the thing.
00:04:34 I think there's three things.
00:04:35 The first thing is that my channel is dead.
00:04:38 So like we just talked about how like only.
00:04:41 You should discuss that.
00:04:42 So explain this to me because this is something that, you know, YouTubers are always trying
00:04:47 to keep track of the algorithmic changes, Matt Petz, the only person who seems to completely
00:04:52 understand it, but he does not reveal all the whole consulting business around it.
00:04:56 So right.
00:04:57 So he's not going to just spill everything.
00:05:00 There's a lot of things we all know and that we all copy, but there's a lot of things we
00:05:04 don't know that we have to theorize about like my theory that my turntable channel won't
00:05:10 get promoted to music channels because it's only watched by my fans.
00:05:15 So like you told me about this part of the algorithm none of us knew about and it's apparently
00:05:20 happening to your channel.
00:05:21 I think it's happening to everybody's channel.
00:05:23 It's just like there's a lot of people complaining like no one's seeing my video or whatever.
00:05:27 And I found out, watching some videos, I've been doing a lot of research on Instagram because
00:05:32 I mean, I'm trying to use Instagram a lot now because I just like the platform.
00:05:36 I think it suits my current work pretty well.
00:05:40 But they have every, everything now has a set algorithm and how it kind of like filters
00:05:43 content and stuff.
00:05:45 And they were talking about how on Instagram, the algorithm on Instagram is that the most
00:05:50 crucial window for your content on Instagram is the first hour.
00:05:53 So depending on how well your content performs, how many likes it gets, how many comments
00:05:57 it gets in the first 60 minutes is how it ranks for the rest of time.
00:06:01 Cause most people when they open Instagram, just look at the first few things and then
00:06:04 check off.
00:06:05 So like if you, if you get a bunch of like traffic on your posts in the first 60 minutes,
00:06:12 it goes to the explore page and then it also can get ranked in the hashtags.
00:06:17 So like every hashtag on Instagram, it has the top nine posts for the day in the hashtag.
00:06:24 So if you do really well, you can get pushed to there and then everybody sees it.
00:06:27 And there's constant chances, not unlike Reddit, but unlike Reddit, it's, it is self-promotion
00:06:32 and not you having to like weirdly, circuitously only promote other people's content.
00:06:37 Another really interesting thing about Instagram is that the, uh, how big the account is that
00:06:43 likes your photo affects your photo as well.
00:06:46 So if you have like 500,000 followers and you like a photo at boost it, because what
00:06:52 it does is that, um, there's also the explore page.
00:06:55 So like if, um, it's kind of like the search function in Instagram, but before you search
00:06:59 for anything, it just shows you a bunch of content, it thinks you'll be interested in.
00:07:04 And that's based on who you follow.
00:07:05 So if you're an account that has 500,000 followers and you like my posts and I have
00:07:10 like 500, right, like a portion of your 500,000 followers will see the posts you liked in their
00:07:16 explore page.
00:07:17 Oh shit.
00:07:18 Is that how the, that's how Twitter works too with the likes then, right?
00:07:21 I think it's similar to that.
00:07:22 I think it has to do, I think on Twitter, it has to do with how many interactions you've
00:07:25 had with the person.
00:07:27 Like if you interact with them a lot, it shows you more of their likes or something or, or
00:07:31 if I don't know if like, I don't know what the fuck the logic is.
00:07:36 I haven't, I haven't looked into Twitter's algorithm all that much.
00:07:39 The only reason I don't even know about this YouTube thing is cause I, they mentioned it
00:07:42 in these Instagram videos, but for YouTube, it's not the first 60 minutes.
00:07:45 It's the first 24 hours and the first 24 hours only sends it out to 10% if you're following.
00:07:50 And depending on how well it does with that 10%, it'll either keep sending out to the
00:07:53 rest of your audience or drop it off completely and no one else will see it.
00:07:57 Clarify what does it mean your audience?
00:07:59 So your subscribers, so like it's, it's public and anybody who like searches for terms and
00:08:04 stuff can still see it, but it, you know how like cause, but will it be different?
00:08:08 Okay.
00:08:08 So I get the sense that, okay, I've never like not seen a video in my feed with the
00:08:14 exception of for some reason, exclusively super bunny hops channel.
00:08:18 And only this year, like will not give me every video he does, but everyone else always
00:08:24 has, but I think the reason is I only watch my subscriptions.
00:08:28 Like I consistently have for years only watched my subscriptions.
00:08:33 And even when I leave my subscriptions tab, most of what it recommends me is shit from
00:08:37 channels I'm subscribed to.
00:08:39 So I think maybe it just shows me, you're probably just cause you're a highly active
00:08:42 subscriber on all the channels you follow.
00:08:44 So it makes you're going to watch them.
00:08:45 And like the only times I ever, like for a very long time, I've had people who will show
00:08:52 up to my video and be like, huh, somehow missed this, didn't show up in my feed.
00:08:56 But like it would be only a couple of comments.
00:08:59 And like most people seem to see it and all the people who are regular subscribers
00:09:02 see it, but like the people in my discord, for instance, they are literally racing to
00:09:07 see who can publish my video in the discord first after it comes out.
00:09:12 So YouTube obviously is just going to recommend them everything in their feed.
00:09:16 But like, I think if you have an account that's not like that, maybe there's more of
00:09:19 a chance that it's, it's, you know, I mean, they keep it all close to the chest, obviously.
00:09:23 Right.
00:09:24 Cause someone like Nate, Nate doesn't even watch subscriptions.
00:09:27 Like he doesn't subscribe to channels.
00:09:28 He just goes to them occasionally when he wants to watch their videos.
00:09:31 Weird.
00:09:32 Yeah.
00:09:32 Why does he do that?
00:09:33 He just doesn't like use YouTube.
00:09:35 Like he doesn't like go there and, and go to the subscriptions tab and see what the
00:09:39 new videos are.
00:09:40 Like most people do, he'll go to trending and do that, or he'll go to like the
00:09:43 homepage and just like watch some recommended stuff.
00:09:45 But he mostly just, but I hate that I do it.
00:09:48 I hate, it just never recommends me anything I want to watch.
00:09:51 So I've, people have told me that if you do enough of the, like, I don't want to see
00:09:56 this button, it will eventually start to recommend you better stuff.
00:10:00 Cause like it takes enough out of your pool of what it thinks you want.
00:10:03 And, uh, but I'm scared that if I do that for some of the channels I'm subscribed
00:10:07 to, it'll just stop showing me that stuff in my subscription box.
00:10:10 So it's, it's a total clusterfuck.
00:10:14 Yeah.
00:10:14 I think that's one of the reasons that the videos didn't do well is because of the
00:10:17 10% thing and my entire channel is just dead.
00:10:19 And because not that 10% not enough of them are anime fans that they were going to.
00:10:25 So they're not going to click on it.
00:10:26 So it's not going to get seen by anything else.
00:10:27 Cause a lot of times, um, cause the first, I ran a Twitter poll trying to figure
00:10:31 out what the fuck's up with it.
00:10:33 So the first poll I ran was, have, do you know that I've been posting regularly
00:10:36 for the past 60, like, uh, like six months, 60% said no.
00:10:40 And Twitter is where I post on the daily.
00:10:42 So that's my most active people who know what I'm doing.
00:10:45 60% of them didn't even know I had uploaded.
00:10:47 Dude, I don't know if Twitter shows people all those YouTube links.
00:10:52 Cause like I've noticed that if I have a video,
00:10:56 why, why, because Twitter has an algorithm now too, like if you don't
00:11:00 turn it off, it does show best first instead of a chronological feed.
00:11:03 Yeah.
00:11:04 So it's the same exact thing.
00:11:05 I've, I've noticed that like my videos, cause I have all my channel set to just
00:11:10 auto tweet the videos and they come out cause I make videos fucking constantly
00:11:13 and I want to fucking just have them do that.
00:11:15 But, um, I've noticed that those never get very many likes or retweets unless
00:11:20 like there's a freak incident where someone retweeted it, maybe a few people will.
00:11:25 But if I like write out a tweet and put a link afterwards to the video, way
00:11:30 bigger chance that people are actually going to interact with it.
00:11:32 It's probably because Twitter, Twitter, I know Twitter actively doesn't like you
00:11:38 going to other platforms, especially Instagram.
00:11:40 I honestly think they're completely right to do that.
00:11:42 Cause there's lots of people on Twitter who the only reason I don't follow them
00:11:45 is too much shit is linked to their Twitter.
00:11:47 Like back in the day when everyone's Tumblr was linked to their Twitter and
00:11:50 you'd follow somebody and it would just be links to their Tumblr and I would
00:11:53 unfollow those people.
00:11:54 I know, I still follow some people who do that and it drives me insane.
00:11:58 The worst thing is like Tumblr has an image preview and you don't realize
00:12:02 it's Tumblr, so you just click, I want to see this picture and then it loads up
00:12:04 a page and I instantly back up because I don't want to wait the fucking
00:12:07 10 years for this to load.
00:12:09 Yeah, but like they, I know Twitter actively hates Instagram because it
00:12:13 doesn't, if you have an Instagram link, it doesn't show an image preview at all
00:12:16 because they don't want you going there.
00:12:18 So you have to like manually do all that shit.
00:12:20 But I know videos do really well on Twitter.
00:12:24 If like you post a preview of the video because Twitter is, everyone's
00:12:29 on the video kick right now.
00:12:30 So they want more video views on their platform.
00:12:32 So if you make, if you take like a 30 second clip of your, your video and then
00:12:38 you subtitle it.
00:12:39 So even if no one is, cause it's going to start auto-playing, but it's not
00:12:42 going to have any sound.
00:12:43 So if you can have subtitles that go with it so they can see what they're doing.
00:12:47 Yeah.
00:12:47 And then you have the link to YouTube to watch the rest of it.
00:12:50 That performs the best, but that takes, you know, fucking effort.
00:12:53 It takes a long time to make all those, but it, I mean, that's how the fucking,
00:12:57 that's how the Facebookers took over.
00:13:00 I mean, I know that for something, if I get back into video hardcore, I'm
00:13:03 going to do that.
00:13:04 You can just go on Fiverr and like five bucks, just like do it.
00:13:08 Well, like pay people to do it for you or something.
00:13:10 I've been, I've been looking on Fiverr a lot.
00:13:12 I have, so I've have someone right now on Fiverr actually like managing my
00:13:15 Instagram, it's not working very well.
00:13:17 But, but just, I'm just experimenting with shit.
00:13:19 How do you like, can you set up like recurring payments on Fiverr or are
00:13:22 you just paying him every time he does, whenever he does?
00:13:24 I paid him, it was, it was for, it was a 15 bucks for a seven day gig.
00:13:29 And he was like only five.
00:13:31 It starts at five, but it can go up to like hundreds of thousands of dollars
00:13:34 depending what the services are.
00:13:37 But, um, yeah, it's, it's, I originally went in there because I wanted
00:13:40 someone to edit my videos, but nobody offers video edits, like what I
00:13:44 would need done, like actually like, you know, you're not going to go on
00:13:47 there and find someone fucking Bangladesh and be like, can you like edit
00:13:50 in some footage from Hoseki, you know, Cooney, relevant in the narration,
00:13:52 talking about things like, what do you've, what?
00:13:54 No, you know, it's just, it's not going to happen.
00:13:56 So, oh, I think I might move this table forward and bring a couple of chairs
00:14:02 over here because this is uncomfortable as fuck.
00:14:05 What did you, what did you back like breaking up?
00:14:07 Yeah, but I, I hunch all the time.
00:14:09 So this is kind of like normal, like dealing with this pain.
00:14:11 So I'm kind of, I sit in like a fucking expensive office chair all day.
00:14:15 Well, well fuck you and your money.
00:14:17 Okay.
00:14:19 I can kind of deal with this.
00:14:21 We should, I can sit up.
00:14:24 It's fucking, this is real painful.
00:14:26 I'm going to get those chairs anyway.
00:14:27 You should talk about, um, tell me about your background in, uh, okay.
00:14:37 I'm just going to skip to what I'm interested in and hopefully the
00:14:39 audience will care too.
00:14:40 That's fine.
00:14:41 I want to know what everything about M dot strange.
00:14:44 Okay.
00:14:44 Cause this guy was like a huge influence on massive.
00:14:46 Yeah.
00:14:47 And especially now that you're doing 3D work, I think it's going to be
00:14:51 something that maybe is more important to talk about than it was before for you.
00:14:55 So, um, first of all, who the fuck is M dot strange?
00:14:57 Try to get these chairs.
00:14:58 Sure.
00:14:59 So M dot strange is a, uh, he's a YouTuber from like way back in the early days,
00:15:04 but he's been creating content for fucking ever.
00:15:06 Like he, he, you dig deep into his stuff.
00:15:09 He talks about like making short films and to edit them.
00:15:12 He busts out two VCRs and like cuts from one back to the other back and forth.
00:15:15 Like that's before that shit existed.
00:15:18 Like he got an iMac and like flipped his shit.
00:15:20 Cause now he can do digital editing.
00:15:22 So, so this was, he's been making shit forever out of fucking way.
00:15:26 But yeah, he's a, uh, he's now, he's a, he's doing game design, but when I got
00:15:32 into him back in 2006, he was, I was wondering what the hell he was actually doing.
00:15:36 Yeah.
00:15:37 He's, um, I kind of like him less now just because like everybody does game design.
00:15:42 Nobody makes fucking movies by themselves.
00:15:45 So like, I feel like it's like less cool, but whatever.
00:15:50 It's, it's still good.
00:15:51 Um, I found him in 2006 because this was back when, uh, when YouTube wasn't a
00:15:58 total clusterfuck and like the featured page actually had cool shit on it.
00:16:01 Yeah.
00:16:02 Do you remember when they had like the featured videos like on the front page?
00:16:05 Oh dude.
00:16:05 I mean, back in the early days, like YouTube was like Freddie W and Epic
00:16:11 Meal Time and like channels you watched cause they were hilarious and cool and
00:16:15 we're doing something like of a caliber that stuff that was like made sense to
00:16:20 be on YouTube, but was a caliber above what you expected from YouTube.
00:16:25 You know, like Freddie W's like call of duty in real life videos.
00:16:30 It's like, you can't make this with a professional film studio because like
00:16:34 it's fucking copyright infringement.
00:16:36 And like, and it's for gamers, a very niche audience who's mostly on YouTube,
00:16:41 you know, but like it made sense there and he did it so much better than what
00:16:45 you expect that it was like, whoa.
00:16:47 Yeah, that's crazy.
00:16:47 And M.Dot Strange, I'm assuming was part of that sort of era because his stuff
00:16:51 is unbelievably impressive.
00:16:53 So like the whole idea was because what M.Dot was at the time and why I got
00:16:58 into him is he's a 3D filmmaker and he does independent 3D animated films.
00:17:02 He did a trilogy of them in like under 10 years.
00:17:06 Probably how long are they there?
00:17:09 An hour and a half, two hours fucking crazy.
00:17:11 Yeah.
00:17:11 And so they're full 3D and he does all of them by himself.
00:17:15 Like he has voice actors and his second film.
00:17:18 He had someone do the music for him.
00:17:20 But other than that, everything they look like if Tim Burton did reboot.
00:17:24 Yeah, like it's a good way of describing it.
00:17:26 They're fucking crazy out there visually just all over the place.
00:17:31 The first film was actually, he didn't know enough about 3D to do a straight
00:17:34 up 3D film, so it's mixed media.
00:17:36 So there's stop motion, puppetry, 3D, 2D.
00:17:41 There's a bunch of clashing medias.
00:17:43 They just kind of like stitched together in laughter effects.
00:17:46 Kind of better comparison.
00:17:48 It looks a little bit like a 3D version of the Madoka Magica witch sequences.
00:17:53 Yeah, especially we are the strange is very, very much like that.
00:17:56 But this was like years before that.
00:17:58 It's still but yeah, he'd been making films like live action and like music and
00:18:03 stuff for, for, for, I think like the better part of two decades, even before
00:18:08 that even hit because he was like in his thirties when that started happening.
00:18:12 That's crazy.
00:18:13 And I love, I love hearing about people who didn't make it till their thirties.
00:18:17 Yeah, I know.
00:18:17 I still have hope.
00:18:19 Yeah.
00:18:19 So, so like, but like he went through a bunch of crazy shit and like he had
00:18:23 like a really messed up, fucked up childhood and like question to believe
00:18:27 because I've read like his books and stuff, like maybe like sexual molestation
00:18:32 and like crazy shit happened back in the day.
00:18:35 But he was doing like live action stuff and he would like dress up as like a robot
00:18:40 and go out and send Jose and like just do chip tunes on the side of walk.
00:18:44 Like as a guy named agent a two zero three is to look up that stuff
00:18:48 and like and just like had like a band just doing like this crazy stuff.
00:18:51 And then he would just like put out stuff on Craigslist.
00:18:54 Like we're shooting a movie this weekend.
00:18:56 You want to be in it?
00:18:56 Come show up and people would come just just make videos with random people.
00:19:00 And he like always had like this one homeless lady that he became friends
00:19:04 with in all of his videos and she was like kind of crazy.
00:19:06 Like he did this whole thing called the potato phone experiment with her.
00:19:09 He just carved the word phone into a potato and like put her in a public place
00:19:13 and just pretend you're on the phone and like make a scene and you record it.
00:19:16 So she's like going to like restaurants just talking to a potato.
00:19:19 That's fucking hilarious.
00:19:20 It's amazing.
00:19:21 The guy's a fucking genius.
00:19:22 But then he did like these three feature films all by himself.
00:19:26 And I was glued to his production diaries because he just like was cranking it out.
00:19:29 And he just like, yeah, I bought like five computers.
00:19:33 Is he rich or like no money come from like he just like he's just like got
00:19:37 like the he just saved up like five grand and just like doing what I think.
00:19:42 And when at that point, I think he was doing like wedding photography
00:19:45 or something like that or like making wedding videos.
00:19:47 So he had like professional cameras and you know, I don't know
00:19:50 because he doesn't talk at all about that side of his life at all.
00:19:53 Like multiple times when he's done like Q&A things, I've asked like, how do you live?
00:19:58 That's what I'm interested in.
00:19:59 And he always never, never, never says anything.
00:20:01 I think that's the hugest difference between like the way millennial artists
00:20:06 are willing to talk about themselves and like the previous generation.
00:20:09 Because like people like just above our age don't like to talk about how much
00:20:13 they make at all.
00:20:15 They don't like to talk about like, you know, who their influences are.
00:20:20 Like because they want to like people used to say, oh, I try not to have influences.
00:20:24 I want to be original.
00:20:25 And now everyone's just like, no, my influences are why I make any money.
00:20:28 You know, like nobody would have played fucking undertale if you didn't tell
00:20:32 people like, oh, it's like Earthbound.
00:20:33 But you know, it's good.
00:20:34 It's good for my birthbound and Homestuck combined.
00:20:37 Yeah, it's good stuff.
00:20:38 So well, I guess Homestuck is already Earthbound.
00:20:40 But whatever point point being like that.
00:20:46 Yeah, it's it's it's it's just like a difference in perspective.
00:20:49 And like for our generation, we grew up with YouTubers who will like
00:20:52 tell us everything about like ever since Game Grumps, you know, I feel like
00:20:56 it's been passe for YouTubers to talk about like, yeah, we make a career out of this.
00:21:00 And like, here's how good of a living we can have.
00:21:03 And here we went to Disney World today on the back of the fucking Game Grumps.
00:21:07 One episode of Game Grumps, you know, it's fucking crazy.
00:21:11 But but yeah, I mean, the guy, the guys, he's like open.
00:21:15 But like for some reason is just like how he makes money.
00:21:17 I almost feel like it's probably because like he doesn't want to admit
00:21:19 that like this doesn't make him a fucking ton of money almost,
00:21:22 even though it's painfully obvious.
00:21:24 I mean, why would it?
00:21:25 Like, I think the most like it's weird.
00:21:27 The most disturbing aspect of my entire life creatively was like when I was
00:21:31 like knee deep in like the pony stuff and I went to check on EmDot and I
00:21:34 realized I had more subs in him.
00:21:36 I like almost killed myself.
00:21:37 I was like, this is not like the world is fucked and we're never going to recover.
00:21:41 That was how I felt when I fucking passed any of the artists I liked.
00:21:44 Like I remember passing like the band Clipping.
00:21:47 I remember passing I passed like Chance the rapper in his early days.
00:21:51 Now he's huge.
00:21:52 But like, like, I mean, not even early days, like when acid rapid come out,
00:21:56 he was blowing up, but I blew up a little faster on YouTube at least.
00:22:01 Obviously not in like album sales or anything.
00:22:03 But yeah, I was passing a bunch of my favorite artists and I was like really
00:22:06 upset about it because I was like, these people are way better than me.
00:22:09 Like even at the time when I was making the pony content, I did not consider it
00:22:13 like great art.
00:22:15 You know, I was just like, this is just something I do because people are
00:22:18 willing to pay me for something I want to do.
00:22:20 Yeah, it was just a fun little distraction.
00:22:22 But it had turned into something.
00:22:23 Yeah.
00:22:23 And like it when it became like, OK, this is just a job now.
00:22:27 That was when it was like, we need to consider ending this, you know, regardless
00:22:32 of what it means for our careers, which I mean, God, could we still we could still
00:22:37 be making money if we were still pony people.
00:22:39 We could probably be making more.
00:22:41 I don't know because there's less people.
00:22:44 There's less people to go around.
00:22:45 Like you don't understand.
00:22:46 Like there is still a core fervent amount of people knee deep in that.
00:22:51 Like my buddy Matt, it's crazy.
00:22:52 He still does like art, like porn art for that.
00:22:55 And his YCH is like go for it.
00:22:57 Oh, you mean a deep pony?
00:22:58 Yeah, like three hundred fifty dollars for like a YCH.
00:23:03 And it's just like, oh, my God.
00:23:04 I mean, that's why a lot of those people are in there is they can't leave.
00:23:07 It's too lucrative.
00:23:08 Like it took my friend Fern a long time to like focus.
00:23:13 Like Fern had burned out on the show even before I did, but was still like in the
00:23:17 community because like when she posted original songs, they just wouldn't get
00:23:21 listened to, you know, like if it wasn't a poor song, no one gave a fuck.
00:23:25 That's the whole thing.
00:23:26 That community was like lucrative, but also insanely insular.
00:23:29 Oh, yeah.
00:23:30 Like they don't they literally don't care about anything else.
00:23:32 Like I would try to make videos when I, you know, first started making anime videos.
00:23:37 I was still making pony and I did like probably 10 anime videos and they all
00:23:41 had like barely any views compared to the pony shit.
00:23:43 Music videos, nothing, you know.
00:23:46 So they you you got to you literally have to sell your soul.
00:23:51 Like if you're still in pony, I'm sorry that you've had to lose that part of your soul.
00:23:56 Well, I mean, there are people who still genuinely love it.
00:23:58 Like I know some people who do.
00:24:01 Sure, I mean, more power to you, I guess.
00:24:04 Like I have no, no, I can't mock you for it because I was there for like three years.
00:24:09 Yeah, if you're still, I mean, if you like, I think it was hilarious when
00:24:14 Jesse and hippo started up the whore, the horsey whore.
00:24:18 What the fuck is the horse?
00:24:19 Because the pony cast, the pony cast, the pony cast was hilarious
00:24:23 because they just kind of like, like, hey, we got a new thing.
00:24:26 And it's just a podcast and it's got a Patreon.
00:24:28 They still make like a hundred dollars or two hundred dollars a month off of it or something.
00:24:32 And I was like, how is this possible?
00:24:34 Like back then we, we thought there was a minimum level of quality control
00:24:40 that we had to do in order for anyone to care.
00:24:43 And it turns out we were wrong.
00:24:46 We just needed to talk about my little pony.
00:24:48 It was, you know, I mean, not to knock that Jesse and Gibbon can do
00:24:52 an entertaining podcast deserving of money, but just the fact that like
00:24:55 they couldn't have made that much talking about anything else.
00:24:59 You know, it's insane.
00:25:00 It's funny because there was, it was like a couple of months
00:25:03 where I was talking with Matt D.V. again about starting after I had like
00:25:07 ended the last channel and I was like, wanted to make easy money.
00:25:10 I was like, what if I just made a whole new channel and uppitched my voice
00:25:14 and just talked about the new scene.
00:25:16 Dude, I've considered, oh, well, that wouldn't do with ponies,
00:25:18 but I've considered doing that plan like for other things.
00:25:21 Yeah.
00:25:22 Just like come back as a different guy.
00:25:25 My plan was like to uppitch my voice enough to make it sound like it was a woman
00:25:29 to like double down on like getting more money.
00:25:31 Oh, boy, that's fucked.
00:25:33 And then I would have.
00:25:34 You could do that.
00:25:35 I could still could.
00:25:36 Yeah.
00:25:36 It'd have been, it'd be very easy, but no.
00:25:39 I can't do it.
00:25:40 Sainter Minds prevailed.
00:25:42 The only reason I can't do stuff like that.
00:25:44 I one time wanted to make a manga review channel that was going to be
00:25:47 me, which a pitch foot with a pitch shifted voice.
00:25:50 And the reason is back when I was doing anime blogging, I had gotten so known
00:25:54 for like this particular style of like really abrasive and like incendiary
00:25:59 dialogue that I wanted to like reset my identity and have people like,
00:26:04 because I had made like several other blogs, but I just wanted people to not
00:26:07 know it was me and make like a polite character.
00:26:10 So my manga blog was like very polite and serious and like no one knew it was
00:26:14 me at all, but also it had very few readers.
00:26:17 But like, I would want to do that.
00:26:18 The funny thing is if I had done this pony channel, the exact opposite would
00:26:21 have happened.
00:26:22 I have no doubt that because the plan was, was insidious and genius.
00:26:26 It would have been girl, a pitch, the voice.
00:26:29 So no one would know me girl would have been very agreeable.
00:26:32 And that's what everybody wants.
00:26:33 They want you to suck the dick, the show's dick.
00:26:35 And then the piece de resistance would have been, never can show my face
00:26:39 because I was sexually abused and I don't want anyone to know who I am.
00:26:43 So you would have just fucking crushed on SJW money.
00:26:47 It would have been so good.
00:26:49 Oh, if you ever got found, oh, shit, the camera stopped.
00:26:53 No one can know my crime.
00:26:55 These are, thankfully, when you have a microphone and it keeps cutting,
00:26:58 it's real easy to sync back up.
00:27:00 That's true.
00:27:03 Yeah.
00:27:04 So well, obviously neither of us went through with those plans.
00:27:06 In my case, I realized that the cadence of my voice is too recognizable.
00:27:10 Like if I read off of a script, I always read it the same way.
00:27:12 And like no amount of voice morphing can make it like, not obviously me.
00:27:17 It's real sad, but you might have better odds because your cadence is not as
00:27:21 recognized.
00:27:22 Another thing I could have just done is paid $5 to some girl read it on fire.
00:27:26 That you could have done.
00:27:27 Yeah.
00:27:27 So, you know, but that would be a total evil scheme.
00:27:31 And the best part is you could get away with it and just never tell anyone.
00:27:35 Like you don't even have to tell us you could have actually done this.
00:27:38 Maybe I'm doing it right now.
00:27:39 Who knows?
00:27:40 Yeah, I said that he wouldn't be quite as like, you probably wouldn't be
00:27:43 begging for money on page.
00:27:45 I just keep the character gone.
00:27:46 It's fine.
00:27:47 So, all right, you were talking about M dot strange.
00:27:52 Yeah, you actually, you actually worked with them before, right?
00:27:55 I have worked with them a little bit a couple of times.
00:27:57 The first thing I mean, I didn't really work with them on this, but like
00:28:00 since I was glued to the production diaries on We Are The Strange,
00:28:03 she was like, all right, I'm going to need a bunch of extras.
00:28:06 So like send me your photo and I'll like fuck it up and like make you look
00:28:09 like a psychopath and you'll be in like a shot in this church scene.
00:28:13 So I was like, OK, and I'm in the church scene at the in the middle of the movie.
00:28:16 OK, yeah, that's the people find you.
00:28:19 Like if yeah, yeah, it's it's it's like it's a quick thing in a church
00:28:22 scene, but it's more like it's also in the end credits and it's pretty obvious.
00:28:26 So that that's I guess it's kind of scour the end credits for Tom Oliver
00:28:30 and We Are The Strange.
00:28:31 Before podcasting and like like like live streaming and stuff became a thing.
00:28:36 He did live streaming on something called blog talk radio.
00:28:39 Have you ever heard of that?
00:28:39 I've heard the name, but I don't know what it was.
00:28:41 What it was was that instead of like just talking live,
00:28:46 you would you would do a live stream on the Internet.
00:28:48 But instead of like having people call in.
00:28:51 Yeah, my phone's going off.
00:28:52 Someone's trying to fucking call me.
00:28:54 I'm trying to ignore it.
00:28:56 Oh, it's not a spam call.
00:28:57 I made the mistake.
00:28:58 I bought polystation2.com and I didn't get the domain protection.
00:29:03 So every day I get thousands of spam calls and like tons of what the fuck things
00:29:08 in my inbox saying, do you need web service?
00:29:11 I'm like, bitch, I make websites.
00:29:13 Don't don't don't get out of here.
00:29:15 But that's something I'm going to ask you about a bit.
00:29:17 But yeah, so what was I even saying?
00:29:20 Wasn't there something you worked on him with the head to do with mindless
00:29:22 self-indulgence? Yes, I did.
00:29:24 I did all the lip syncing for the characters in one of those
00:29:27 minus self-indulgence videos he did because he did videos for
00:29:30 minus self-indulgence and rabbit junk.
00:29:32 What songs?
00:29:33 Because I've never seen only one I've ever seen animal from that's from if, right?
00:29:39 I think so.
00:29:40 I don't even remember which fucking song that is.
00:29:42 It's an animal, it's an animal, it's an animal, I'm believable.
00:29:47 OK, that sounds familiar.
00:29:49 That might be from the, oh, you know what?
00:29:51 It's probably from the three heart album or the heart maybe the heart shape one.
00:29:55 I remember I did this during college.
00:29:57 So when I should have been doing homework, that's probably the album
00:29:59 that would have been coming out at the time.
00:30:01 Like 2010 ish 2008, 2009 ish problem.
00:30:06 OK, that's yeah, it's either from if or less than three.
00:30:08 I think it's if because less than three was like the short EP that came right
00:30:11 after that and I wouldn't recognize the songs as well on that.
00:30:17 In any case, so how do you do you think that like his style has influenced yours
00:30:24 at all because yours doesn't really look like his.
00:30:27 Your style is more like comic book.
00:30:29 Yeah, I wouldn't say he influenced my style in terms of like his artwork.
00:30:33 Like I think I'm more interested as much as I love his movies.
00:30:37 I'm much more interested in him as a person and his work ethic.
00:30:39 Yeah.
00:30:40 Because I just what I really liked about him back in the day and to this day
00:30:44 is that he's like not afraid to like say things that are like fucking insane
00:30:48 and like just like raw.
00:30:50 Like he'll talk about like how much he hates like Hollywood
00:30:53 and how much he hates like all this like shit because he just like is uncompromising
00:30:56 and like because he could do like actual things that worked.
00:31:01 But he just doesn't give a fuck.
00:31:03 He's like he could be like he could be working on like Coraline or something.
00:31:07 Yeah, easily like here's the thing.
00:31:10 Like, you know, he for somehow through like some like fucking
00:31:13 I think it's just because it was unprecedented.
00:31:17 Like he submitted We Are the Strange to the Sundance Film Festival
00:31:21 and got accepted. Right.
00:31:23 So the movie showed there and he he while he was there,
00:31:27 like this is like him.
00:31:27 He's still like not didn't know much about Hollywood and everything
00:31:31 hated the entire experience because they like that he got an agent from there
00:31:34 and they're like, well, we need to buy out the theater.
00:31:37 So we need to like have all the theater when we play has to be full of plants.
00:31:41 So everybody loves the movie.
00:31:42 They react crazily over the top so they can they get people to buy it.
00:31:46 And he was like, get fucked.
00:31:48 So instead, he just like went on Twitter and was like, hey,
00:31:50 you want to come see the movie?
00:31:52 Why would they think a guy like that would be they didn't?
00:31:55 They had no idea who they were dealing with.
00:31:56 Like did they watch the movie?
00:31:58 Yeah. So what happened instead is that like they're just like normal
00:32:00 people from the film vessel came in and then he had an army of people
00:32:03 from Twitter who came in like my buddy, my buddy,
00:32:06 Ed went up there and like shit and went and see it.
00:32:09 And like so everyone who was just there from the theater got up and left
00:32:11 because they were disgusted by the movie.
00:32:13 Everyone who brought there like fucking lost their shit.
00:32:17 And so but the regardless, he got like, I think like 10 or 15 deals
00:32:21 on the movie and turned them all down.
00:32:23 So like there was like big money on the table and you just like get fucked
00:32:27 and just publish it himself instead.
00:32:29 Didn't want to go through any more bullshit.
00:32:31 Yeah, because he's just like he looked through the contracts like, OK,
00:32:33 like I don't own my movie anymore.
00:32:35 Like fuck you.
00:32:37 Yeah, you know, at this point, I'm sure he's probably made more
00:32:40 on Blu-ray and DVD sales don't need to do that in today's world.
00:32:43 Yeah, but this is like 2007 and he's like, you know, like had the foresight
00:32:46 just like fuck that curve for sure.
00:32:48 Yeah, he's like published like books like.
00:32:50 But that's the thing.
00:32:51 I think though a lot of I think a lot of the
00:32:55 God, I'm about to sound real fucking old and I'm accusing myself of this too.
00:32:59 But I think a lot of our generation of like content creators
00:33:02 are spoiled because we knew it was possible.
00:33:05 Like a lot of the people before us were like hoping it was possible
00:33:10 or like had the like thought like, hmm, well, you know,
00:33:13 you guys might not want to buy my movie, but I see the Internet over there
00:33:16 and I'll bet if I release it there, people might like it.
00:33:19 But like we know that we know it's possible as a result.
00:33:23 I think that's why a lot more people now are like just doing like YouTube
00:33:27 du jour instead of their unique ideas.
00:33:30 The generation before us and, you know, it wasn't possible for them.
00:33:33 So I understand the confusion.
00:33:36 But like the thing that really worked for MDOT for me is that he made
00:33:40 me realize that I wanted to be my own boss.
00:33:43 Because before that, like my plan was like my big influence
00:33:46 before that was a Joan Vasquez.
00:33:50 And so I was like, oh, I'll just like make a really cool comic.
00:33:52 It's very closely related to MSI.
00:33:54 Have you ever been into MSI or do you just happen to like?
00:33:57 I just I just happen.
00:33:58 I mean, I've listened to a bit of mindless self-indulgence,
00:34:01 but it's like it's good, but not like I'm a huge fan.
00:34:03 Yeah, so like it's weird how like it just worked like that
00:34:06 because I watched his video.
00:34:08 He did too.
00:34:09 Yeah, I was like, this is fucking dope, but it wasn't animated.
00:34:11 And I was very disappointed because I wanted to be a fun video and super cool.
00:34:15 But yeah, like so my plan before that was like, I'm going to publish
00:34:19 with SLG or something like that, because I was listening to a podcast
00:34:22 called Indie Spinner Rack all throughout high school and just these two guys
00:34:26 who just like knew everything about the indie comic scene.
00:34:29 And I ended up going to the Mocha Art Festival in New York and like met a bunch
00:34:32 of people and like was like shopping to recommend me that podcast.
00:34:35 Is it like, is it good to get into if you don't know anything about indie comics?
00:34:39 I knew nothing about indie comics going into it.
00:34:41 They they name drop a lot and don't provide a lot of context,
00:34:45 but they give you things to Google.
00:34:47 The podcast is long defunct.
00:34:50 Like it ended like five years ago, but all the information on it's still pretty good.
00:34:54 Yeah, they recommend a lot like like artists.
00:34:56 They recommend are like people like indie.
00:35:01 Yeah, because they're older.
00:35:02 So it's like indie to them is like not like web comics.
00:35:05 It's like the Xerox books and like ship them out.
00:35:09 The hardest thing about getting into like indie comics is just that nobody talks about them.
00:35:13 Yeah, these guys did a really good job.
00:35:15 And I just like started like learning like the names of the presses and like people.
00:35:18 And I was like, I bought a bunch of books.
00:35:20 They did like a they did two anthologies and I bought both of those.
00:35:26 And the guys like they did they did work.
00:35:28 So they went to both went to the Joke Hubert School for comics.
00:35:31 Yeah. And I learned about where is that?
00:35:34 Is that like famous?
00:35:35 Oh, yeah, Joke Hubert is like a famous like comic artist.
00:35:38 And like you go there and like you learn it's just you just go there to learn how to draw comics.
00:35:41 And then there was another school that opened.
00:35:44 Oh, my God, was it the Center for Cartoon Studies?
00:35:47 And I learned about it through that podcast.
00:35:49 And I was like, this is the college I'm going to.
00:35:51 And I was so fucking stoked.
00:35:53 And I was because like this was like the tail end of high school and my parents
00:35:56 like you need to go to college.
00:35:57 I'm like, I don't want I just want to draw.
00:35:59 And they're like, no, do it.
00:36:00 So I'm like, I want to go to I want to go I want to go to CCS.
00:36:03 And they're like, we are not signing loans for you to go throw your life away.
00:36:06 Little did they know I was going to throw my life away regardless.
00:36:09 Yeah. So what did you end up doing?
00:36:12 Well, after that, I went to a bunch of art schools, like quote unquote, regular art schools.
00:36:17 How old are you in the city?
00:36:19 17, 17, 18 ish at that around that age.
00:36:23 Like it's just, you know, your birthday, November 8th.
00:36:26 OK, so so you would have turned 18, like towards the start of senior year.
00:36:30 Yeah. So this is like right before that.
00:36:33 So we're looking at colleges and stuff.
00:36:35 And so everyone I go to
00:36:39 doesn't take me like I remember I went to the Art Institute of Boston
00:36:43 and the guy sat me down and just like I'm sick and tired of seeing portfolios
00:36:48 that are just shit get out.
00:36:52 Was it shit?
00:36:53 Yeah. OK.
00:36:54 I was a really bad artist and I knew it.
00:36:57 You have improved a lot.
00:36:58 Yeah, no, I'm definitely like way better than I was back then.
00:37:01 Do you think you'd get accepted there now?
00:37:03 Probably not just because like that there was a fine art school.
00:37:07 Like I never had a chance in hell of getting to a school like that.
00:37:09 And that's kind of what I.
00:37:10 Yeah, this is why I wanted to go to CCS.
00:37:13 Yes, because they're they're they would see your potential
00:37:17 and think this is a totally right because your art style is real different.
00:37:21 And I want to ask you about that, too.
00:37:23 Like how the fuck did you develop this art style?
00:37:25 Because I have literally never seen anyone with the style that even
00:37:28 like resembles yours.
00:37:30 Um, I don't.
00:37:31 And yours has changed a lot, too.
00:37:34 Yeah, because when you started doing my little pony art,
00:37:37 you were doing very show accurate stuff and your stuff on its own was
00:37:41 a little bit more, I don't know.
00:37:43 Like you you're very into variable line widths.
00:37:46 Yeah, which I don't think most people even know what the fuck that means.
00:37:49 I only learned that term from you.
00:37:51 But it's where the I mean, it's as it sounds when you draw the outline
00:37:55 of a character, it like has curves and like it gets thicker and thinner as it goes.
00:38:00 A lot of it is very hard to do thick, thick, thick line, thicker lines are usually
00:38:04 kind of used to highlight shadows or like places that are supposed to be darker.
00:38:09 It's done a lot.
00:38:10 I mean, it's not done in animation basically ever because it's so hard to animate.
00:38:14 Yeah, because like if you're doing variable line width, you have to keep
00:38:18 that line with placement consistent from frame to frame, which like,
00:38:22 which is why when people like watch like a one punch man
00:38:25 soccer casino, they're like so blown away, you know, since like how the fuck?
00:38:29 Like you're insane.
00:38:31 But yeah, I'm super big into like line art and stuff like that.
00:38:35 I don't know.
00:38:36 I mean, anime was the first big artistic influence for me.
00:38:39 I mean, trying to draw anime, but I never could really do it.
00:38:42 The only anime I can think of that has outlines as fucking thick
00:38:46 with two Cs as yours is DBZ.
00:38:48 But I mean, you were into that.
00:38:50 Yeah.
00:38:50 No, I was huge into DBZ or Powerpuff Girls.
00:38:53 Yeah, I did.
00:38:54 I did like Powerpuff Girls a lot.
00:38:56 I don't know.
00:38:56 I just I just consumed a lot of different things.
00:38:58 I watched like everything that was on TUNAMI.
00:39:01 I really liked the original full about Huckmus and that was airing.
00:39:04 I was obsessed with that.
00:39:05 I don't think that comes through much in your art style.
00:39:07 Maybe you're writing, but not so much the.
00:39:10 No, I don't think artistically, it's a lot of influence there.
00:39:12 I mean, was there a comic artist who was like your
00:39:15 favorite, who you used to list as like your biggest influence?
00:39:19 Let's see.
00:39:20 I I mean, one guy who worked in like all black and white.
00:39:26 Aren't you like a fan of Bone?
00:39:28 I do love Bone.
00:39:29 Jeff Smith's Bone is fucking gorgeous.
00:39:31 Bone is a little bit like your art.
00:39:33 A little bit.
00:39:33 Yeah, it's way more detail.
00:39:35 That guy is like fucking super pro.
00:39:39 I like.
00:39:42 Wait, am I thinking of his bone?
00:39:44 The one that's like a detective?
00:39:46 No, I wait.
00:39:47 What is is it all black and white?
00:39:49 It is. They did a reprint.
00:39:51 Scholastic did a color reprint.
00:39:53 That's why I've seen a color version.
00:39:55 But yeah, I really like Dave Sim.
00:39:57 He did Sarabis, which is another one of those like he did.
00:40:00 How God fucking Dave Sim.
00:40:01 What a fucking winner.
00:40:02 I just my favorite artists are them people who are just like
00:40:05 everything fucking sucks.
00:40:06 Do it anyway.
00:40:08 Like that just gets me like rock hard.
00:40:10 It's so good.
00:40:10 Like Dave Sim is just like like, oh, God, he's such a cool guy.
00:40:14 So like he he did all this like 300 issue comic by himself.
00:40:19 Like the tail end of it.
00:40:20 He had some guy do the backgrounds with him, but he's just like
00:40:24 an alcoholic guy who just draws comics and and and just like says,
00:40:28 fuck you.
00:40:30 Like like he had this book that came out because he started in the 70s,
00:40:33 I think, and like he was quoted early in an early menu series when someone
00:40:36 asked him, like, how long is Sarabis going to be?
00:40:38 Because it was like blowing up at the time.
00:40:39 He's like 300 issues, like just kind of just not thinking.
00:40:43 And then he's like, fuck, now I got to do 300 issues.
00:40:46 So like he finished it in like 2005.
00:40:48 So like 30 years, just grinding this shit out.
00:40:51 And like, I remember because they were talking about an indie
00:40:52 spinner rack and they interviewed him.
00:40:54 They were one of their first gigs.
00:40:56 Their first like gags on the show was called dialing Dave
00:40:59 because this is like when the internet still isn't this.
00:41:01 So they would just look in phone books for people named Dave Sim,
00:41:03 then call them live on the phone.
00:41:04 They're like, are you Dave Sim who made Sarabis?
00:41:06 Like some random guy like, who the fuck is that?
00:41:08 And they're like, click.
00:41:09 Well, that's not Dave Sim.
00:41:11 So like there's like episodes of episodes that they eventually
00:41:13 like found the actual Dave Sim.
00:41:14 I think like he contacted them or something.
00:41:17 But Dave Sim hates all technology, doesn't own a computer,
00:41:20 doesn't have an email address or anything like that.
00:41:23 So he drew everything by hand and like cut out the zippitone dots
00:41:27 and glued them down and like, like fucking he cut.
00:41:31 Wait, so you know, like the halftone dots.
00:41:34 You don't mean like individually.
00:41:35 No, no, no, he did screen tone the screen tone.
00:41:38 I mean, isn't that normal in Japanese manga though?
00:41:41 The Japanese are insane.
00:41:42 All right.
00:41:42 Over here in America, where we take shortcuts.
00:41:44 We have Cuban rights.
00:41:45 Yeah, we laugh.
00:41:47 That's not even that far from the truth.
00:41:49 So yeah, he does this and and they, I guess at the end of Sarabis,
00:41:53 they spoiled the end of Sarabis for me because I still haven't finished it
00:41:55 because it's like 300 issues.
00:41:58 So it's like he published because he had his own publishing company
00:42:03 called Ardvark Veraheim Press and he published everything himself
00:42:06 because then this is the 70s.
00:42:07 I'm like, it's not internet.
00:42:08 And even now he's like internet is gay.
00:42:10 So he has some guy run his website and everything.
00:42:16 But so he had these big volumes that he called phone books
00:42:19 because they were the size of phone books that had his comics in them.
00:42:23 And so at the end of the run, he kills Sarabis.
00:42:25 Like Sarabis dies at the end of everything.
00:42:27 Well, now you spoiled Sarabis.
00:42:28 Yeah.
00:42:28 So I mean, if I have to suffer with knowing how it ends, all of you do too.
00:42:32 I think actually on his emails, I think he started a new service.
00:42:36 There's only two ways you get into story.
00:42:38 Right.
00:42:38 The main character does or doesn't die.
00:42:41 Like those are the two endings.
00:42:42 So that's a spoiler for you.
00:42:44 Then who the coin toss, you know, like.
00:42:46 So like, I think he actually is doing a new Sarabis series.
00:42:48 I need to look for it because I just got a message in my inbox
00:42:50 like two days ago called Sarabis and hell issue two is out.
00:42:54 I'm like, whoa, so.
00:42:56 But yeah, well, the character has gone to hell.
00:42:58 Yeah, like in the nature of the series to have, I mean, or is that weird?
00:43:02 I'm not super far into it
00:43:04 because I have the first three volumes, which is a fuck ton of comics by itself.
00:43:07 But there's still like, I think nine more that I have to get.
00:43:10 And they're hard to track down.
00:43:12 So. But yeah, at the.
00:43:14 So he dies.
00:43:15 I'm like, they're they're talking to Dave Sim.
00:43:17 They're like, I was really emotional.
00:43:18 Like at the end of the series, like, like, did you feel like
00:43:21 as you have been with this character for 30 years?
00:43:23 And he's like, how did you feel about like killing your character?
00:43:26 And he's like, so glad the fucker's dead.
00:43:28 Yeah, I imagine.
00:43:30 Like, oh, my God, it's always been looking forward to you for 30 years.
00:43:33 Like halfway through, Sarah, this is run.
00:43:35 He came out with a book called the Sarah, this style guide.
00:43:38 And he was just like, look, you got to do a page a day.
00:43:43 And what you need to do is need to for a month, you have to do a page a day.
00:43:46 And every day you don't fucking do it.
00:43:48 You have to reflect on why you would get it done.
00:43:52 Was it was it?
00:43:53 He's like, was it because was it because you were lazy?
00:43:56 You know, was your girlfriend?
00:43:58 You got to choose the page or the girlfriend.
00:44:00 That's the power of of comics is that because it's a well-established
00:44:05 medium to go in for 100 years, like there's generally like a speed.
00:44:09 People have agreed upon like a page a day is healthy.
00:44:13 More than that is necessary if you're doing a Shonen Jump comic.
00:44:16 Yeah, you need to like, but you need a team, probably.
00:44:19 I can't imagine.
00:44:20 I get like as much as I like making art, I could never publish for Shonen Jump.
00:44:25 You well, you have to be real dedicated to both a.
00:44:29 Doing manga and be making money.
00:44:31 Yeah, it's like to make it and Shonen Jump.
00:44:33 It's not about doing the manga that you're the most passionate about.
00:44:38 It's about doing the manga that is the best idea.
00:44:40 When I read Bakuman, I like literally like every every Shonen anime
00:44:45 I ever read dropped like two points across the board.
00:44:48 I realized that they were all fake.
00:44:50 I mean, I felt that way too.
00:44:51 But at the same time, it made it more special when something is that good.
00:44:55 And you're like, fuck, they did.
00:44:57 Like Bakuman makes Death Note more enjoyable
00:45:01 because they talk about the serious comedy thing.
00:45:03 And when you read about that and then you read Death Note
00:45:05 and you see how they did that and that the anime left it out.
00:45:08 Yeah, you're just like, mm, the manga was better.
00:45:11 You know, like this is why I read eight volumes of this
00:45:14 and why I did not finish the show, even though I was interested, you know.
00:45:18 But but in any case, so these comic book
00:45:24 authors are big influences on you.
00:45:26 Yeah, comedy wise.
00:45:27 It sounds like you were you did the same thing I did,
00:45:29 which was brainwash yourself into believing that you can work from home
00:45:33 and not have to answer to anybody.
00:45:35 Well, the thing was just that I've never, ever, ever, ever
00:45:40 been able to visualize myself in a professional environment.
00:45:43 Yeah, I just do it.
00:45:44 It's fucking impossible.
00:45:45 Well, the thing is just like my biggest thing is I know that I'm going to die.
00:45:50 Yeah. And the fact of like even like like that's I hate being depressed
00:45:54 because I spent half my time doing something I don't want to ever do
00:45:57 anything you don't want to do.
00:45:59 If you might get hit by a car tomorrow, right, you'll be like,
00:46:01 didn't do anything I wanted to do.
00:46:03 And that's that's why I was told to do when we did the the the art
00:46:06 apologies thing, like that's why I hate that I haven't done any of this shit yet.
00:46:09 So like my thing right now is I'm doing this Polystation two thing
00:46:11 and I'm like practicing my craft and getting better at doing like these fan
00:46:14 art pieces.
00:46:15 But like if nothing big happens with it, I'm just like, fuck it.
00:46:18 I'm just going to do Sorcerous Lost.
00:46:19 And like if I have to live in a box, so so be it.
00:46:23 All right, heavy question.
00:46:25 Would you say that that desire to like have completed things is what's keeping you alive?
00:46:32 Yes, because I got the sense that like because you've been you've been openly
00:46:37 very suicidal for a long time.
00:46:39 Sure. Yeah.
00:46:41 And but it seems as though like the reason that you've never been like gung ho
00:46:45 about I'm going to go die today is that like you haven't made a masterpiece yet.
00:46:50 I'm like I'm like it's it's I'm I'm depressed and anxious at the same time.
00:46:55 And so it's just like I want I definitely their days.
00:46:59 I'm just like, I'm just going to like end my life.
00:47:01 Like I feel like crap scenario.
00:47:02 You create something that you legitimately believe is like a work of merit.
00:47:08 No one cares about it.
00:47:10 What happens?
00:47:11 Nothing, because I'm already operating under the assumption that that's what's
00:47:14 going to happen, like deep down in my mind, I'm kind of convinced at this point,
00:47:19 like probably not going to be a Digi Bro.
00:47:22 Like that's probably not going to happen for me.
00:47:24 Like becoming as big as I am because I don't intend to stay at this level.
00:47:27 Right. But like I'm not even going to reach that point.
00:47:29 I think I'm going to be this weird, awkward guy who's just going to not.
00:47:33 I don't know. It depends on I think it depends on how legitimately good
00:47:38 could the projects you come out with are.
00:47:40 Because like so far, your narrative projects have never really come out.
00:47:43 Yeah. Yeah.
00:47:44 Except for the My Little Pony fan fiction.
00:47:46 Yeah.
00:47:46 But like you can't recommend that to your friends too easily.
00:47:50 No. No, unfortunately.
00:47:53 No. But like I just think that it's hard to say, like one of the problems I've
00:47:58 always had with with with trying to, you know, when you come to me for advice,
00:48:02 I'm like, well, the problem is that it's hard to say if you need to like,
00:48:06 like you're good enough that I'm like, clearly this guy could do like an
00:48:11 amazing series, like a great, he could write a great novel.
00:48:14 He could write a great comic.
00:48:15 He could write a great whatever, but like it hasn't happened yet.
00:48:18 Right.
00:48:19 And so it's hard for me to say, like, oh, you're, you know,
00:48:23 people just don't care about your art style as opposed to, well,
00:48:26 if you gave them like a great story, they might.
00:48:29 And maybe the kinds of stories that you are best at telling can't be done
00:48:34 in a short amount of time, you know, like, because there are some people
00:48:37 who can just like draw a picture in an hour and it somehow tells a story
00:48:43 and people are like entranced by it.
00:48:45 And then there's other people who are like, I can tell a way better story
00:48:48 than that, but you're going to have to give me a year.
00:48:49 Right.
00:48:50 Well, that's my, I just, I work insanely slowly.
00:48:53 And I don't know, I don't know if it's because I just have a really shit
00:48:55 work ethic or if I'm just like, I think it's your, I, I'm going to go ahead
00:48:59 and say, I don't think that your work ethic is your biggest problem.
00:49:02 Because I think that the work I've seen you do is unbelievably taxing
00:49:09 the way you do it.
00:49:09 Like back when you used to draw, because you did a few art
00:49:12 live streams and you were doing the Trixie comic, do you want to explain
00:49:16 that period of time?
00:49:18 How, what happened there?
00:49:20 Actually, we might have to cut off and upload footage and then read, restart
00:49:24 if this is going to be long, probably only like six minutes left of recording.
00:49:27 I can probably get through this in six minutes.
00:49:29 All right.
00:49:29 Um, no, well, that was just, I got, I got big into vectoring
00:49:35 during MLP because that's like how they did the show was with vector graphics.
00:49:40 The difference between doing vector graphics in the show versus when I was
00:49:43 doing them, because like a vector graphic is just, it's infinitely scalable.
00:49:47 Yeah.
00:49:47 So like it's all done with points and math instead of pixels.
00:49:50 Um, but the way you do vict vector art, like precisely is use the pen tool.
00:49:56 And so you base, it's all done with bestie.
00:49:58 Do you not do that anymore when you draw?
00:49:59 No, I've moved, I've moved.
00:50:01 I mean, sometimes I still do.
00:50:03 Because when you were doing that, I watched some of those live streams
00:50:05 and you would be like drawing a tree for three hours.
00:50:10 Yeah.
00:50:11 And I was like, this is what, like you could, you were doing
00:50:14 commissions that you literally could charge somebody like $50.
00:50:19 And you're, you're only getting paid like a dollar an hour
00:50:22 for the amount of work you did.
00:50:24 I'm running into that problem right now with 3D because like I'm doing,
00:50:26 I'm pricing it out.
00:50:27 Like if I wanted to start commissions or you're just planning on it.
00:50:31 But the problem is like to, to charge minimum wage to do a commission.
00:50:35 It would start at like $300.
00:50:37 And how long is the commission?
00:50:38 Or just, is it just a model or it's just like a model to do a model
00:50:41 with like a turnaround and one pose would take probably like, there's some
00:50:44 people who would buy it, but they're not in your YouTube audience.
00:50:47 No, they're not like, they're, they're no, I don't know them yet.
00:50:50 Essentially.
00:50:51 All right.
00:50:51 The card is filled up.
00:50:52 So we'll take a short break to, uh, unfilled.
00:50:57 Here we go.
00:50:57 So before we just took a little break, you were talking about your influences
00:51:02 and how you have a lot of clear influences on like your lifestyle and
00:51:05 mentality, but not so much on your actual aesthetic art style.
00:51:09 Yeah.
00:51:10 I guess it's kind of, that's a bit more nebulous to track.
00:51:13 Um, my, my art style has changed a lot, uh, as, as time has gone by.
00:51:19 Uh, I, I can definitely recall like specific artists that I was trying
00:51:23 to integrate into my style, but like my, my art really took off when I
00:51:26 stopped trying to actively develop it.
00:51:29 Um, Jonah Vasquez was huge back in the day.
00:51:32 I think everybody had a Jonah Vasquez phase who was into drawing
00:51:36 comics or art in the mid 2000s, like invaders him, killed all of us.
00:51:42 And then Johnny the homicidal maniac and squee and all that shit.
00:51:45 Um, I remember distinctly, uh, I started getting into spawn, like the original,
00:51:51 like spawn run from image and, uh, Oh God, what's the guy's name?
00:51:56 Not Tard McFarlane.
00:51:57 I like, I love his art too, but like the guy specifically, uh, Steve, no.
00:52:01 Hmm.
00:52:02 Oh God, I'm blanking, but it was specific, specific artists, artists on
00:52:06 spawn that I really fucking liked, um, Dave Capullo, he was fucking dope.
00:52:11 And like his arts, the complete antithesis of what I do, cause it was
00:52:14 like really thin lines, tons of cross hatching and extraneous detail everywhere.
00:52:19 And like really soft painterly colors.
00:52:21 It was like, he took like Todd's art style and like pushed it further.
00:52:25 Um, and I, but I really liked him.
00:52:26 There was a whole phase during college where I was desperately trying to do
00:52:29 that and failing miserably because I have no patients.
00:52:32 And at one point specifically, I remember in illustration class, I was like,
00:52:35 fuck it, I'm not this.
00:52:36 So I did the exact opposite.
00:52:38 It did really simple cartoony things.
00:52:40 And I think that's probably where my style like kind of became its own.
00:52:44 Cause I realized like I'm way too lazy to sit there and spend 10 hours on one
00:52:47 drawing that people can look at like your old fucking like super detailed shit.
00:52:53 I mean, I don't think any of it's online anymore.
00:52:56 Uh, was it any good?
00:52:59 No, that was the whole problem is like, I didn't have the patience to be a
00:53:03 Dave Caputo cause like his art, like you could zoom in that shit like extensively
00:53:10 to make it work.
00:53:10 It's just like, I don't, I don't know how, how people sit there.
00:53:14 Cause like my whole thing is like, I want to tell the story and the art.
00:53:19 Well, you've always been way more of a narrative as than an esthetician, I suppose,
00:53:24 which is kind of funny because you do mostly work in visual mediums or
00:53:29 you've, you've, like you've always considered like visual mediums to be at
00:53:32 the forefront of your career, except for the period where you were trying to be
00:53:35 a novelist.
00:53:36 Yeah.
00:53:37 Um, how do you like reconcile that?
00:53:40 Sure.
00:53:40 I think I really enjoy my, my favorite things, like ever since I was a little kid,
00:53:45 like stories and like experiencing stories have been really thing.
00:53:48 I think one of my very, very, very, very first influences was Animorphs.
00:53:53 That scholastic book series, like everybody laughs them for the covers.
00:53:56 That book series was fucking crazy.
00:53:58 Like people were killed.
00:53:59 You just reread that a couple of years ago.
00:54:00 I did.
00:54:01 I read, I bought, I bought the whole series again to read, check it out.
00:54:05 And like the writing is super basic, but like, it's about like high school kids
00:54:10 being traumatized by war.
00:54:11 Like that's what the entire thing's about.
00:54:13 And like the book ends super solemnly.
00:54:15 There's no happy ending.
00:54:16 They don't win.
00:54:17 Shit's bad.
00:54:18 Oh, that's like, they, they end up like spoilers for Animorphs.
00:54:22 I'll actually warn you this time.
00:54:23 They end up like repelling the aliens and everything, but the book,
00:54:27 the last book is like 15 years later, one of the characters has post-traumatic
00:54:32 stress disorder and nobody knows where he is.
00:54:33 He just dropped off, faced the planet.
00:54:35 The ship that was through the entire book, Cassie and Jake never happens.
00:54:39 They break up because Jake is like not able to like parse, like not being in war.
00:54:45 So they can't work out.
00:54:47 And like it's just like super, like just like how like soldiers, they never recover.
00:54:51 Yeah.
00:54:51 And so like the book ends with like Jake, like going back into space to go on another
00:54:55 mission and like the book ends with them encountering some other aliens.
00:54:58 And like, it's like, do they live or die?
00:55:00 We don't know.
00:55:02 That's some heavy shit.
00:55:03 Yeah.
00:55:03 Like the thing is, like they like get stabbed and murdered and like severed.
00:55:08 And like, like there's one point where like, uh, like one of them gets cut in half
00:55:12 and they have to like de-morph back to human.
00:55:14 Cause when you, your wounds recover, when you go back to your regular form.
00:55:18 So like they almost die a bunch of times.
00:55:20 There's like torture and murder and like all this crazy shit.
00:55:22 That's like, I never actually read any of it.
00:55:24 It's so good.
00:55:25 Oh God.
00:55:26 I really wish they was like an adult revision of this.
00:55:29 Cause the way it works is that, um, there's these aliens called the yurks and like
00:55:33 they're parasites, they go into your ear and they take, they wrap around your
00:55:36 brain and take over your body.
00:55:38 And so there, there's like these aliens everywhere.
00:55:41 Um, like parasite, they're parasitic aliens and, uh, they have like these, they've
00:55:46 taken over tons of tons of worlds and now they're coming to earth.
00:55:48 Cause in this world, earth is like, we're basically, we breed like cattle.
00:55:52 So like there's like, we're billions of people on earth that like doesn't happen.
00:55:56 Like all these other planets, there's a couple million of both species, but here
00:56:01 it's like a gold mine for this alien race.
00:56:02 I'm like, we're super underdeveloped, but our bodies are like really great for them.
00:56:06 So they're like trying to take over the planet.
00:56:08 And then there's other aliens called the andolites who are fighting them.
00:56:12 And so, um, the way they fight them have this to basically for espionage is morphing.
00:56:19 So you can like acquire the DNA of an animal by touching it.
00:56:22 And then for two hours, you can transform and become them.
00:56:25 Um, but if you don't de-morph in two hours, you're trapped in that form forever.
00:56:30 So the characters don't have like a specific animal they morph into.
00:56:33 They just can morph into animals.
00:56:35 You can pull a bunch of different ones.
00:56:37 And once you acquire DNA, essentially, yeah, but the interesting thing is when
00:56:41 you transform into an animal, the first time you have to fight its instincts
00:56:46 because it can take over your mind.
00:56:48 So that never happened to any characters.
00:56:50 It does.
00:56:50 It does temporarily.
00:56:51 Like one of the scariest things is like when they have to morph into ants
00:56:56 and like ants are just like automata.
00:56:58 So for like 15 pages, they're just like they find another ant colony and like
00:57:03 they're describing what happens when they have no control of themselves.
00:57:05 They're like biting other ants and have it having a huge colony war.
00:57:09 And like halfway through it, they realize what's going on.
00:57:11 And like they de-morph in the middle.
00:57:12 Like they burst through a wall and like fall out and it's like they're all
00:57:15 traumatized and like like 20, 30 books later, they're like, well, it's never
00:57:19 morph into ants again ever.
00:57:21 But one of the kids Tobias, like he the very first book he gets stuck trapped
00:57:25 in the form of a hawk.
00:57:26 So for like half the series, he's just a hawk.
00:57:29 And so he lives, he lives in the woods.
00:57:31 He and like he for the first for the first like 20 or 30 books, like people are
00:57:36 like he'll like go to like Jake's house and like he'll like feed him like a
00:57:39 hamburger or something because he has to just eat meat now because he's a bird.
00:57:42 Um, and, uh, eventually, uh, he just like, he's been in a hawk so long, like he
00:57:49 just succumbs to the, the, uh, the instinct and he starts hunting and like killing.
00:57:53 Like they describe in great detail.
00:57:55 He finds a mouse or rips it open.
00:57:57 It starts feasting on its intestines and he has like a fucking panic attack.
00:58:00 But eventually like his like subplot is like learning to just accept the fact
00:58:03 that like this is who he is now narrates through this, this hawk and every,
00:58:08 every book changes narration, its first person narration, but every single
00:58:12 book it changes from one of the five, one of the six main characters.
00:58:16 So this is one of his books where he just describes it like, yeah, I just
00:58:19 ate this thing and it was fucking great.
00:58:21 So like, he just starts doing that.
00:58:23 And like at the end in the last book in the series, they're like,
00:58:27 because he never, he's just a hawk.
00:58:29 So like there was like, we don't know what happened to Tobias.
00:58:31 Like hawks only live for a few years.
00:58:32 He could be dead.
00:58:33 We don't know.
00:58:34 He just disappeared.
00:58:35 That's nuts.
00:58:36 It's, it's, it's so fucking good.
00:58:38 But like that's like that and Digimon are probably like my two big, like super
00:58:42 big influences in the beginning.
00:58:43 Cause those are like the only things that had like a continuous narrative that
00:58:47 kept going on.
00:58:49 Um, so all right.
00:58:52 Well, I guess we kind of got to the heart of your, uh, your influences.
00:58:55 Unless there's any other, like, are there any influences that aren't really
00:58:57 like art related, but are like way more than most people realize, like affect
00:59:02 your life, you know, um, I don't know.
00:59:07 I mean, like I, I watched a lot of like, like YouTube, like, uh, I really
00:59:13 liked Gary Vee.
00:59:14 He's fucking dope.
00:59:15 Never heard of him.
00:59:16 Uh, he does like, uh, business and like social media and personal
00:59:21 brand development and stuff.
00:59:22 He's super cool.
00:59:23 I'm about to read his new book.
00:59:24 What would you say are your biggest influences as a YouTuber?
00:59:29 Oh, I don't know.
00:59:31 I really don't.
00:59:32 I mean, it's just kind of an amalgam of like, yeah, it's just like, I don't
00:59:35 styles that have sort of sprung from the primordial ooze of the biggest one
00:59:40 that we both had in the beginning was a sequelitis.
00:59:43 Like that's where our whole format initially came from.
00:59:45 Pretty much was just like trying to, I mean, he took it from Mr.
00:59:47 Plinkett.
00:59:48 So it really, he's like the forefather of this current style, you know, um, in
00:59:54 terms of like, I really liked just like tech YouTubers when I was doing
00:59:58 Rebel pixels, a lot of MKBHD and like Austin Evans and, and, and I pocket
01:00:03 out a bunch of all the big ones.
01:00:05 You definitely had MKBHD is like, uh, attitude towards tech, which is like
01:00:11 these, everything should be like kind of sleek and modern.
01:00:14 And like, I mean, it's unfortunate that you were filming it in a basement as
01:00:17 compared to his fucking studio.
01:00:20 I mean, not that he always had that, but like, you know, you have, you, you
01:00:24 branded it very strongly to look like that kind of channel.
01:00:28 Like everything is like modern and cool.
01:00:31 Yeah.
01:00:31 I mean, that's what I went to school for.
01:00:33 Yeah.
01:00:34 Tell me more about that.
01:00:35 Cause again, um, a lot of the things about you that fascinate me the most are
01:00:40 the things that have nothing to do with YouTube at all, um, such as your
01:00:44 graphic design and website design history.
01:00:47 Cause you make good, how the fuck did you make the sorceress lost website?
01:00:51 The motion comic site, a lot of work.
01:00:53 It was just like all, I mean, I still have the file.
01:00:55 You can look at it.
01:00:56 It's all hand coded and just like, those aren't like gifts or no, they're
01:01:00 or anything they were video files with no audio.
01:01:05 And then you, there's an HTML five.
01:01:07 They have like a video embed, like, uh, I don't even remember the word before it
01:01:12 is at this point, just like a option you can do.
01:01:14 In case anyone doesn't know what we're talking about, go to the sorceress
01:01:17 lost site, it's still up.
01:01:18 Unfortunately, some of the fonts don't work anymore.
01:01:20 Cause like Dropbox, I was hosting a bunch of stuff for it on Dropbox.
01:01:23 Um, and then Dropbox changed the way their files work.
01:01:27 So you can't link out to other files anymore.
01:01:29 So all the web fonts that I was hosting all don't work.
01:01:31 So it's like in times in Roman, it looks 10 times worse than it used to.
01:01:34 Um, but yeah, it's just, uh, and then I went into the player, you can
01:01:39 edit the properties of the player.
01:01:40 So I set it to autoplay and then to hide the controls.
01:01:42 So they look like gifts, they act like gifts, but they're video files.
01:01:45 So like a 10th of the size of the gift that would be,
01:01:48 but you can scroll over it and like, yeah, when you scroll over it, the
01:01:51 controllers, the pot, they pop up, right?
01:01:53 It's really sleek looking.
01:01:55 And I'd never seen anything presented that way, but I assume that the
01:02:00 bottom line is, it is not worth the amount of effort to tell that story that way.
01:02:05 Um, I mean, now that I can do 3D, it would be so much easier to do the same thing.
01:02:10 Do you still think you might take that direction with, uh, it's very
01:02:14 sourceable, I've realized to go back to the question that you initially asked
01:02:19 was how do I reconcile wanting to do visuals, but being a very narrative
01:02:23 centric person?
01:02:24 The reason I started writing for a while is because like I came to the
01:02:27 conclusion, like all I really care about is telling the story and like,
01:02:31 why not just do that?
01:02:32 And the problem, not even the problem, but like what I realized through
01:02:35 doing that is that my really like visual storytelling.
01:02:39 I like being able to like move the camera around and like do things without,
01:02:43 just, I hate description.
01:02:45 Yeah.
01:02:45 Like every time I got to get to a book and like, when they have to
01:02:48 describe all this shit, like, like the Scootaloo book that I wrote, it
01:02:53 doesn't have the word said in there ever.
01:02:56 I never made an active decision to never have a said tag because I
01:02:59 hate that so fucking much.
01:03:01 The word said.
01:03:02 Yeah.
01:03:02 So every time, instead of like saying, like they said, I'd be like, you know,
01:03:07 that the opposite is what is preached is correct.
01:03:09 Right.
01:03:09 Right.
01:03:10 Well, the thing is, I, it's because they say don't change said to like, he
01:03:14 replied or he did.
01:03:16 So what I did instead is I would use what's called an action tag.
01:03:19 So instead of being like saying like, like, Hey, did you, I said or something,
01:03:24 I'd be like, I picked up the can off the table.
01:03:26 Hey, did you?
01:03:27 And then, you know, I love stuff like that.
01:03:29 So it was, I don't put any saids in my stories usually either, but I'll just
01:03:33 like full paragraph break for dialogue.
01:03:35 Yeah.
01:03:35 I mean, write it like a script, you know, the thing, that's how I usually
01:03:38 start when I would write all those chapters, like, because the dialogues
01:03:41 apart, I love doing the most.
01:03:42 I just write the dialogue out and then like, okay, I guess what I'm going to
01:03:45 do while they're talking and then just go back through and like slowly piece
01:03:47 the scene together.
01:03:48 Yeah.
01:03:50 Um, that's interesting.
01:03:51 But that, but doing all that, like, I loved writing the dialogue.
01:03:54 I loved coming it up with this story conceptually, but I would get super bogged
01:03:58 down and like trying to not a, um, writing like descriptions of things because
01:04:04 like, I'm like, I could just draw this and then be like transitioning from
01:04:08 scene to scene was also tricky.
01:04:10 I don't, I don't know how to like, I don't know if it's just that back in
01:04:13 the old times when you had to read books.
01:04:16 I think people had a just more ability to imagine what those places looked like.
01:04:24 Cause when I read like a long descriptive part of a book, I cannot
01:04:27 picture it at all.
01:04:28 Like I just come up with whatever I think it might, but I'm just like, this
01:04:31 doesn't feel right.
01:04:32 The same way that just seeing a picture, you in a picture, whoever said pictures
01:04:36 worth a thousand words underestimated the worth of a picture, right?
01:04:39 Like a thousand words ain't that much.
01:04:41 And you can tell a fucking big story with a picture.
01:04:44 Like just show a picture of someone's room and you can tell me like a thousand
01:04:49 things about that character, you know?
01:04:50 So I totally agree that like with certain scopes of stories, like a big
01:04:56 fantasy story, like it's real hard to be able to like write enough minute
01:05:02 details without it bogging down.
01:05:04 Like a lot of fantasy novels and shit, I have a great example of this in
01:05:08 Sorcerous Laws depth of why like this is actually one scene in the beginning
01:05:13 of SL that I don't think I'm going to use anymore.
01:05:15 But at the time in the first revision I was working on really made me like think,
01:05:19 fuck, I don't really think I can work with books the way I want to.
01:05:22 Cause there's, there's a shot that I had that in the beginning of the story, Sarah
01:05:27 was going to go to like the docks and meet somebody who was coming in for her
01:05:31 mentor and pick up these scrolls that he needed.
01:05:34 So what I want to do, she was going to sit down on like a bench, wait for the
01:05:38 ship to come in and then they're like, we got sound like the ship's coming into
01:05:41 dock. She turned around and like it was the camera would zoom out and you see
01:05:45 that not only is that ship coming to dock, the islands like floating in the
01:05:48 sky being suspended by magic.
01:05:50 So there's like this airship coming into dock, not just a regular ship.
01:05:53 So it zooms out, you have this big glory shot.
01:05:56 And I was like, oh, this is so cool.
01:05:57 But then I switched to a book.
01:05:58 I'm like, how the fuck am I going to do this scene?
01:06:00 There's no way to give the camera pants out and like it would sound like, but
01:06:04 that's how I think of a visual art.
01:06:06 So I'm like, I can't write it.
01:06:08 Like it's exactly, I can write the dialogue just fine.
01:06:10 But like in terms of like telling this story and just telling stories in general,
01:06:14 I'm thinking like a director and not.
01:06:16 When I was trying to write the the book that I wrote back in 2010 for Nana
01:06:21 Remo, like it took me two years to get it to the stage of a novel because the
01:06:26 initial idea I had was just of like a scene of someone firing a bullet and then
01:06:30 like time stopping and the character like flicking it around and shooting it back
01:06:34 or something like that.
01:06:35 But the only way it made sense in my head was visually.
01:06:38 It's like, no one will understand how cool this power looks if I describe it in
01:06:42 text because you don't see the bullet stop.
01:06:44 Right.
01:06:44 You know, so it won't.
01:06:46 This story can't be told that way.
01:06:48 Yeah.
01:06:49 And eventually it just changed the story.
01:06:50 So that worked for me.
01:06:51 Yeah, I cut that scene out of the written version.
01:06:54 It's up on Tumblr.
01:06:54 You can read it.
01:06:55 It doesn't happen like that.
01:06:56 But like, I don't, I don't.
01:06:59 I mean, every time someone makes a YouTube video about any adaptation of anything,
01:07:03 they're like, oh, mediums can't be crossed.
01:07:05 Like it's new information.
01:07:06 But like, you do kind of have to keep reminding people, including yourself,
01:07:09 like, hey, some of your ideas just won't be.
01:07:13 Yeah.
01:07:13 Do I mean, to, to, to, in defensive books, something that's really easy to do
01:07:17 with books that's harder to do with other visuals is engage even not even
01:07:22 expedition thing I was going to say is engage all the senses.
01:07:24 Yeah, you can describe easily how things smell, how they feel without having to
01:07:29 like, like if you're going to do that in a visual thing, like you can either imply
01:07:32 it with visuals or you'd be like, Hey, it stinks in here.
01:07:35 You know, you, you can't really like elegantly integrate in senses.
01:07:39 I think I think the best thing about text is just that like a character can
01:07:44 easily give their reactions to a situation.
01:07:47 Yeah.
01:07:48 And I think that like a lot of the reason that adaptations from like books to
01:07:53 film always end up so bad is that like the book, the book is not focused on the
01:08:00 visual element because it can't do that well.
01:08:02 Right.
01:08:02 It's focused on the fucking thoughts in the character's head.
01:08:05 So like most books are more focused on character development.
01:08:08 Well, I think, you know, and like something that I was noticing while I was
01:08:11 writing, because I was trying to figure this out myself is that like any visual
01:08:17 medium kind of always like has the issue of time, right?
01:08:21 Cause like most, most of a movie is done basically, like each scene is in real
01:08:24 time, whereas in a book, like in between two people talking, like one sentence
01:08:30 and another, the character can have a thought that goes on for like 16 pages.
01:08:34 Yeah, exactly.
01:08:34 And like there's no way to, you can't just like stop the frame.
01:08:37 Like and then the character thinks like it feels totally weird.
01:08:41 And what are you going to show?
01:08:42 Right.
01:08:43 You can't really do anything.
01:08:44 Like you, like, like you'd have to like go into their head and like animate
01:08:47 all this stuff, but like it feels awkward because like nothing's shot like that.
01:08:51 Yeah.
01:08:52 And I mean, obviously there's lots of books that like, like House of Leaves,
01:08:55 there's no way to make not a book because like it's constant notations
01:09:00 and active reader participation.
01:09:02 You can maybe make it a visual novel, but not, not a book, you know?
01:09:07 But, um, yeah.
01:09:08 So, so Sorceress Lost is still in the works, would you say?
01:09:13 For sure.
01:09:13 Okay.
01:09:14 Um, I just finished like a rewrite, like a month and a change ago.
01:09:18 I have the first chapter redone.
01:09:20 So how like glued to this universe are you a Sorceress Lost?
01:09:25 I really enjoy it.
01:09:27 And depending on how I mean, my plan initially was like, I would want to
01:09:31 have like any future stories I do take place in Salon as well, which is
01:09:35 like the name of the world.
01:09:36 Yeah.
01:09:37 I, uh, speaking as one former aspiring author who gave up on his world to
01:09:44 another, um, because for me, the hardest thing about any project is I have an
01:09:49 idea for the next project.
01:09:51 And so like it becomes, I don't want to let this project take up too much of my
01:09:55 time because I want to move on to the next one.
01:09:57 Do you ever feel that way about Sorceress Lost?
01:09:59 Like, is there another project like underneath that waiting to get out?
01:10:03 Or is it more like this is my thing and I want it to fucking happen?
01:10:07 The weird thing for me, and like this almost undermines everything I've
01:10:11 been saying so far is that I, and like this is something I've been dealing
01:10:15 with a lot recently and trying to figure out.
01:10:17 And I think I've kind of understood it is that because I have like all
01:10:21 these self-esteem problems, like my projects don't feel real or as special.
01:10:25 Like I can't be as passionate about SL as like how I got, I can't be as into
01:10:31 SL as I was into like MLP or something like that.
01:10:33 Just because like, because it's from me, it feels tainted almost like intrinsically.
01:10:38 But like the way I'm trying to like get around that is I've, I've, I've found
01:10:43 that some of my best work and the things I can get most hype about that I
01:10:47 work on is when I'm working as a group, because then the project transcends
01:10:51 just me and it becomes bigger and more important.
01:10:54 Did you watch my Dear Artists video?
01:10:56 I did.
01:10:56 Cause I, you inspired that video.
01:10:59 I figured when I was like the first photo to come up as like artists
01:11:02 struggling, I was like, I think, I think I was watching, did you recent, like in
01:11:06 the last week put out like a hyperbolic wine chamber or something?
01:11:09 Yes.
01:11:10 Cause it was, I was watching that and you were just talking about like the
01:11:13 difficulties of marketing yourself and stuff.
01:11:15 And I just somehow the thought crossed my mind about Vocaloid or something.
01:11:20 And I was just like, Tom should do that or something.
01:11:23 I don't know.
01:11:24 I was just like artists can team up and they can make it like take
01:11:29 some of the burden off of yourself, you know, it doesn't have to be all you most.
01:11:32 I think that the YouTube sphere is very individualistic, even though there's
01:11:38 like tons of YouTube channels that are teams, you know, like, especially a lot
01:11:41 of the big ones have multiple persons behind them.
01:11:44 But like, I think the romantic idea of the YouTuber is like guys like Casey
01:11:48 Neistat who are just like, I don't sleep and I make a video every day and it's
01:11:52 always good.
01:11:53 And so we pressure ourselves to be like that.
01:11:56 Um, and obviously, you know, the idea of like odd tour artists and shit, but like
01:12:00 even a fucking, you could look at Quentin Tarantino and be like, oh, he's
01:12:03 my favorite director, but it's like, he would be nothing without the
01:12:06 cinematographers who bring those fucking shots to life because his cinematographers
01:12:10 are God tier.
01:12:12 So like, you know, I think not enough people to some, some people responded
01:12:18 to my video, like, isn't this all obvious?
01:12:20 This is one on one shit.
01:12:21 And other people were like, thanks, Digi revolutionized my life going to
01:12:25 implement this right now.
01:12:26 I was looking through the comments because like I was kind of like in both
01:12:29 camps because it was like, yeah, this is like something I've been considering.
01:12:32 And at the same time, other people were like, I don't know.
01:12:35 So I guess it depends on where you are.
01:12:37 Yeah.
01:12:37 I mean, for some people, they just never even think about how like marketing
01:12:42 yourself is extremely difficult.
01:12:44 Cause first of all, you have to recognize what about yourself is marketable.
01:12:48 And then you've got to figure out like who is going to care.
01:12:51 And how do I find those people and show it to them?
01:12:54 Well, I think one of the things that like I've had issues with is that like,
01:12:59 I've always been afraid that the stuff I actually want to do has no market value.
01:13:03 Right.
01:13:03 Cause like even with police station two right now, I think, like
01:13:07 it's I'm doing fan art on police station too.
01:13:09 When like at my core, like if you ask me, what do I think of fan art?
01:13:12 I think it's stupid.
01:13:13 I think it's a waste of time.
01:13:14 Yeah.
01:13:15 Like it's not like it's obviously a great marketing tactic to use, but I don't feel
01:13:19 like I feel like it has inherently less artistic value than doing original work.
01:13:23 But ironically, it is the only thing anybody cares about.
01:13:26 Exactly.
01:13:27 Unless, unless, well, okay.
01:13:29 At the same time, though, I do feel like there's a little bit of anytime.
01:13:34 Well, okay.
01:13:34 You're going to agree with me on this because you're really hard on yourself.
01:13:38 You would probably say that if you made a good enough story, you would need to
01:13:42 rely on fan art.
01:13:44 I mean, some people do that.
01:13:46 I mean, I think if you get to a certain, there's a certain like level that
01:13:50 once you hit that, like the work speaks for itself.
01:13:53 Most people aren't there.
01:13:54 Everything that people are drawing fan art of is something that reached that level.
01:13:57 Exactly.
01:13:57 You know, like it had to be good enough that people, it inspired fan art and, you know,
01:14:03 it was, I got a really interesting comment on that wine chamber.
01:14:06 I did someone said, like, it's like, I've never really personally connected to
01:14:10 your work because the most stuff you've been doing recently is fan art.
01:14:14 Whereas I really connect to Ben because everything he's doing is his own work.
01:14:18 Right.
01:14:18 I'm like, that's an interesting.
01:14:20 I mean, for me, the difficulties with connecting with your work is mostly that I
01:14:25 know how much you hate it.
01:14:27 And it's hard for me, like, especially the YouTube videos.
01:14:29 Yeah, I just, I'm not like, if I watch a YouTube
01:14:31 video that I know you didn't want to make, then I'm just like, well, he obvious.
01:14:37 Like sometimes you just seem like you're having fun with it.
01:14:39 Like you put out a vlog because you just wanted to rant about this thing.
01:14:42 And like, that's why a lot of my videos exist.
01:14:45 They weren't made for an audience.
01:14:46 They were made because I had an idea and I thought, eh, 3,000 people will click on this.
01:14:50 It's worth posting.
01:14:52 You know, like someone might think this is quotable or funny or they've had the same
01:14:55 thought, but, uh, but when it's one that I can see that you like forced yourself to
01:15:00 do, I'm just like, Tom, you got to get out of there.
01:15:03 Like you got to get out of there.
01:15:05 You got to make the stuff you want to do, you know?
01:15:07 Yeah.
01:15:07 And that's like, I'm the next couple of months.
01:15:10 Like I have my nest egg for moving, which is going to happen, I guess, in a few months.
01:15:14 So I quit my job before coming to RAGCon because I'm like, I'm just going to focus
01:15:19 on getting that.
01:15:20 Tell us about the job you've been doing.
01:15:22 I want people to understand the, because you've talked about it briefly, but the
01:15:26 conditions of this job are terrible.
01:15:29 And it's cause I guess the guy who hires you owns half the city and can just do
01:15:34 whatever he wants.
01:15:35 Yeah.
01:15:36 Um, cause we, we actually, uh, when it got really bad, we actually talked to one of
01:15:40 the, uh, like officials for the town and he was like, yeah, it's fine, but you can't
01:15:46 do anything about it.
01:15:47 Like, don't try.
01:15:48 So I'm just like, okay.
01:15:50 Uh, but yeah, no, I work for the last like two years, I've worked as a quote unquote
01:15:55 security guard at an abandoned building, uh, Draper mill in the center of our tiny
01:16:00 little town, and it's an old, old building.
01:16:05 It's like stripped to the bone.
01:16:06 There's just nothing in there, but like asbestos, probably, and lead, even though
01:16:10 apparently they've done, you know, inspections and it's fine, maybe, but, uh,
01:16:16 yeah, and I just like do the graveyard shift.
01:16:18 So 11 PM to seven in the morning.
01:16:20 And you just wander around an abandoned building, wander around the abandoned
01:16:22 building, just to, to what?
01:16:23 Make sure homeless people don't sleep there.
01:16:25 I mean, we don't even have homeless people in Hopedale, but, uh, what did
01:16:28 anything ever happen that would there were the only thing you having been there?
01:16:33 Okay.
01:16:33 Well, the reason I'm tech, they call you a security guard.
01:16:37 The reason I'm there is I'm babysitting the building because we go around the
01:16:41 entire building and like, make sure the fire extinguishers are fine because
01:16:45 there's the building isn't up to fire code.
01:16:48 And so legally this guy has to have someone in there to use the fire
01:16:51 extinguishers in case the building catches on fire, but we're neighbors with
01:16:55 the head of the fire department.
01:16:57 And he said, if you want to die, do your job.
01:16:59 If you want to live, get the fuck out of that building.
01:17:01 If it ever catches on fire.
01:17:05 Well, so you've been doing this incredible, dangerous, dirty job.
01:17:11 Does it pay over the table?
01:17:14 Yeah.
01:17:15 Okay.
01:17:15 So, but it's just a shit job that you, that the guy can't be taken to task for it.
01:17:20 Yeah.
01:17:20 And he just owns.
01:17:21 You were doing that for like over a year, right?
01:17:23 Yeah, two years.
01:17:24 Holy shit.
01:17:25 But you kindly quit.
01:17:27 Yeah.
01:17:27 I figured whatever.
01:17:29 I mean, you're not going to have a house in a month anyway.
01:17:31 So fuck it.
01:17:33 So, okay.
01:17:33 I need to understand exactly the plan because I kind of like the idea that
01:17:40 you're just going to try to live in your car and do art from there.
01:17:43 What do you, what is the plan?
01:17:45 Like, well, where are you taking the car first?
01:17:47 Well, here's the thing.
01:17:48 The thing is I have a couple options, apparently.
01:17:51 I have a friend who might want to move in with me, but she's been very slow on
01:17:57 the uptake on that.
01:17:58 So I'm not really relying on that.
01:18:01 But if I did that, I have to like be a normal person and get another real job.
01:18:06 And like, I don't really technically want to do that.
01:18:08 So that's like one of the options.
01:18:10 The second option would be to buy a tiny house.
01:18:15 Are they cheap?
01:18:16 That cheap?
01:18:16 They can be.
01:18:18 Okay.
01:18:18 Some of them are.
01:18:19 Cause usually like a tiny house can be just like.
01:18:21 Is a tiny house cheaper than a trailer?
01:18:23 So you can just get a trailer.
01:18:24 A trailer.
01:18:26 Put yourself down.
01:18:28 Yeah.
01:18:28 I mean, I'm looking into options right now.
01:18:31 Trailer is definitely one option.
01:18:33 Tiny house is, I mean, a lot of tiny houses are just like houses built on a
01:18:37 trailer bed anyway.
01:18:37 So they're around the same size, but just a bit nicer.
01:18:40 Okay.
01:18:40 And then the other option is to convert a cargo van into a mini like apartment on
01:18:46 wheels and drive.
01:18:46 Are you aware of the YouTuber Noah called?
01:18:48 Well, I told you about him.
01:18:51 Okay.
01:18:51 So this guy is a gaming YouTuber whose thing is that he does like two and a
01:18:56 half hour long analysis videos of entire franchises.
01:18:59 Like he'll, he'll do like dragon's age and then he'll go through all the
01:19:03 dragon's age games and talk about all the storylines and compare everything and
01:19:07 say like, here's what was good.
01:19:08 Here's what was bad.
01:19:09 And, uh, his audio is dog shit.
01:19:11 He doesn't edit the audio at all.
01:19:13 So you can hear him like wrestling with papers and fucking up lines.
01:19:16 And, um, fucking stuttering.
01:19:19 He's got a very dry voice.
01:19:20 He barely edits the video.
01:19:22 It's usually just like long gameplay footage, but just because of the fact
01:19:26 that he talks about an entire game series all the way and talks about everything.
01:19:32 And because of the fact that it's all PC games that have like fervent cult
01:19:36 followings, he's got a huge Patreon, uh, not, not huge like mine, but like, you
01:19:41 know, big enough to sustain himself on and he had been a pizza boy at the time.
01:19:46 But he had this, he's like a huge into road novels, like obsessed with road novels.
01:19:50 So he like refurbished a Volkswagen van for like three years.
01:19:54 And now him and his wife like live out of the van and just travel the country.
01:19:59 Do he just uploads YouTube videos from wherever and like subsist off of Patreon
01:20:03 and like sort of him doing that was part of what inspired me to hit the road, you know,
01:20:08 and be like, oh, shit, we can do this from anywhere.
01:20:10 I gotta fucking the camera.
01:20:12 Stop.
01:20:13 When you told me you were going to be doing PS2 graphics out of the back of a car,
01:20:17 I was like, hey, it's Noah Coldwell.
01:20:19 Jervay is doing it.
01:20:20 There's, there's a whole making as much as he is.
01:20:22 There's a whole, uh, like culture of people doing that.
01:20:25 Like I follow tons of YouTubers right now who are just traveling and just
01:20:29 traveling doing that.
01:20:29 Like the difference is that they do it because like they love living on the road.
01:20:33 I'm doing it because I hate having a life.
01:20:35 Have a house to go back to though.
01:20:37 Noah Coldwell Jervay was just dirt poor.
01:20:39 He like just sold off the house and all of their belongings and went into the
01:20:43 Volkswagen van.
01:20:44 Like that is the life now.
01:20:46 There are people who do that.
01:20:47 They just like, they live the van life.
01:20:49 Like they've just decided.
01:20:50 So I could live the RV life.
01:20:51 I could not live the van life.
01:20:53 The like Volkswagen van where the bed is like your body went from the ceiling.
01:20:58 Yeah, that's pretty.
01:21:00 It's it's cramped as fuck, dude.
01:21:01 But I mean, I don't feel like I would be that much.
01:21:05 You don't take up much space except as being like six foot.
01:21:09 Yeah, but like in terms of, you know, your, your, your range of activity.
01:21:14 Yeah.
01:21:14 I mean, I would only sleep in the thing.
01:21:16 Yeah.
01:21:17 I've been planning on probably just like going to like coffee shops or whatever
01:21:20 and get out and net cafes and just, I mean, I can do my work there.
01:21:24 Yeah.
01:21:24 So, but like a tiny house would be kind of the same idea.
01:21:28 Um, I just, I don't, like it said, I can't even imagine like getting up at like
01:21:34 six a.m. putting on like dress clothes, going into a cubicle.
01:21:39 Like I would either like get a gun and either kill myself for everyone around
01:21:43 me, because I mean, I've done that.
01:21:46 I did an internship for my dad at Hanscom Air Force Base for like a summer
01:21:51 and a winter and it paid good money.
01:21:53 Yeah.
01:21:54 I want to be clear.
01:21:55 You like you are like, uh, first of all, how old are you?
01:21:59 29.
01:22:00 So you're 29.
01:22:01 I think you're the, as you were Ben, the oldest Ben is the oldest by
01:22:04 a couple of months.
01:22:05 Okay.
01:22:05 So you're sort of a battle hardened veteran of many life trials.
01:22:11 Uh, I guess I don't feel like, I feel like my life's been pretty easy, which
01:22:15 is, I mean, compared to, let me put it, I was telling Munchie about how I got
01:22:19 fucked over on my job and he was like flabbergasted, but I'm just like, I don't
01:22:22 know.
01:22:23 Well, I mean, it's that you have, you've been to enough things that I wouldn't
01:22:28 say that when you're, when you're saying, I can't even imagine myself at a
01:22:31 normal job, it's like you, you've worked them.
01:22:34 You're not just saying that cause like, I know there's a lot of people, like I
01:22:38 like to say things like, oh, like I could never go back to work, but like, I
01:22:41 didn't even really hate the one job I've ever had.
01:22:44 And like, so I could probably do a normal job.
01:22:47 Like I probably could not for long cause I'd be constantly scheming to quit.
01:22:51 But like, um, you know, you are not just saying this out of nowhere.
01:22:56 You've worked a bunch of places.
01:22:58 I think you worked at a Whole Foods.
01:23:00 I did.
01:23:00 That was probably my longest stint.
01:23:02 Yeah.
01:23:03 Was I did like, I was, I have like this curse, like, except for this job, which
01:23:08 was like, to make it clear, I was so bad even at this job that I probably
01:23:12 should have been fired, but there was nobody else there to fire me.
01:23:15 So it was impossible and nobody else would do that shift.
01:23:18 So like, I, when I put in my notice, like a day before I came here, the guy
01:23:21 was like, are you sure we can give you like two months off to like not be sick
01:23:24 and dying anymore?
01:23:26 And I'm just like, no, dude, I'm cool.
01:23:29 They're just going to offer you months off.
01:23:31 Yeah.
01:23:31 They're just like, we can give you two months off if you need to like recover.
01:23:34 And I'm just like, I'm okay because they know how bad, right?
01:23:38 Because they know, they know that no one's going to take that slot before the
01:23:41 winter even started, but the winter was bad to enjoy the summer.
01:23:45 Okay.
01:23:46 To, to tell you how bad it was, um, I can actually show you a photo after this
01:23:50 to show you what the office ended up looking like.
01:23:51 If you want to laugh your ass off, uh, I kept it for legal reasons.
01:23:55 I figured if it was going to go down, I needed ammo, but, um, if anybody decides
01:23:59 to class action this guy, so I think that's how that works.
01:24:04 The, uh, the building for almost the entirety of the summer had no, for the
01:24:09 entire, the winter had no heat anymore.
01:24:11 The heat was broken.
01:24:12 So, uh, even imagined that he would be involved.
01:24:15 Yeah.
01:24:16 So like, there was a picture of this place.
01:24:17 It's not even like walls.
01:24:18 There's like one little office where they kind of had heat, but the heat stopped
01:24:22 working.
01:24:22 Yeah.
01:24:23 So it was just like, and then the whole building leaks.
01:24:26 So every time it rains, the office floods, the entire building floods, but
01:24:29 like the building never completely dries.
01:24:32 So there's mold and mildew all through the whole place.
01:24:34 Why is they keeping it up?
01:24:36 Because they can't get rid of it.
01:24:37 The problem is like the town's water supply runs under this building.
01:24:40 So if they do anything to it, the entire water supply is fucked.
01:24:43 Oh boy.
01:24:44 And, and they're just stuck with the shitty building.
01:24:47 Yeah.
01:24:47 There's nothing.
01:24:47 It's, it's just a relic of a lost age that can't be salvaged and can't be
01:24:51 destroyed to, and this guy has to pay somebody to do this job.
01:24:55 Legally.
01:24:57 But he won't like take care of them because it's a worthless job.
01:25:00 Exactly.
01:25:01 Cause there's no, there's no money in it though.
01:25:03 Yeah.
01:25:03 He's just doing it to keep himself from getting sued.
01:25:06 Actually, funny enough though, a lot of people out there have probably seen this
01:25:10 building because if you've seen the movie, the surrogates.
01:25:14 I have not.
01:25:15 Okay.
01:25:15 It's the, the movie of Bruce was based on a comic and indie comic, which was really
01:25:18 good.
01:25:19 There's a scene where they go to the slums and this movie had a multimillion
01:25:25 dollar budget.
01:25:26 They could have gone anywhere in the world to film the shithole of the movie.
01:25:32 And where were they for about three weeks and everyone was freaking out because
01:25:35 Bruce Willis was in Hopedale, Massachusetts in the building I worked at.
01:25:40 So the slums of that movie is where I worked for two years.
01:25:43 Look at the literal cyberpunk slum.
01:25:45 Yeah.
01:25:45 That's a cyberpunk movie, right?
01:25:48 Sort of.
01:25:49 I mean, it's, it's not like, so it's, it's kind of more like a general
01:25:53 culture, sci-fi kind of.
01:25:55 Yeah.
01:25:55 I guess, I guess you could classify it as cyberpunk.
01:25:58 It doesn't play the aesthetic very, very hard.
01:26:00 It looks very kind of normal.
01:26:02 It's still fucking hilarious.
01:26:03 Yeah.
01:26:03 That building.
01:26:04 Every, but that was the whole thing.
01:26:05 I was like stunned.
01:26:06 Everyone's like, oh my God, Bruce Willis is here.
01:26:08 It's just so amazing.
01:26:09 I'm like, we, we're officially the shittiest place on the planet Earth.
01:26:13 Like, do you understand?
01:26:14 Like, like they could go anywhere.
01:26:16 They could have filmed us in Africa if they wanted to.
01:26:18 They came here.
01:26:19 How many years was it between you saying that and then working there?
01:26:23 Um, oh God, when did that movie come out?
01:26:26 At least five years.
01:26:27 It was a while.
01:26:28 That's nuts.
01:26:29 Well, yeah, go check out Tom's building in Syragates with Bruce Willis.
01:26:33 I'm sure they CGI'd up a little bit, but they didn't go that far.
01:26:36 Let me tell you.
01:26:38 All right.
01:26:40 Well, so do you think that your life's going to be better or worse once you're
01:26:45 out of your parents' house?
01:26:47 Better, for sure.
01:26:48 So you think even though, even though you're going to be in, uh, like
01:26:52 living possibly living out of a car, would you still say that was like better
01:26:55 than nothing material things don't interest me, you know, like, like, I'm
01:26:59 the person that if like I made like a million dollars a year, I wouldn't
01:27:03 have a big house.
01:27:05 Do you think that you are going to like in the, the, this, you sort of
01:27:10 talked about like being liberated by this.
01:27:13 Um, yeah, I think there's just a lot of like, because like the interesting
01:27:18 thing is like you have moved around your entire life.
01:27:21 Yeah.
01:27:22 Constantly.
01:27:23 I went to sixth grade right down the street from where I live right now.
01:27:29 I see.
01:27:29 My entire life has been this tiring, tiny little fucking.
01:27:33 So you think that by escaping that you might open something up?
01:27:36 I, yeah, definitely.
01:27:38 I like it's imagine.
01:27:40 It's weird when you drive to work and you pass by your high school.
01:27:43 Yeah.
01:27:44 At 29.
01:27:45 Yeah, a little like that's super fucking.
01:27:47 That's why I like literally it's funny.
01:27:49 You say that because like, you know, I moved to my, my girlfriend's town, like
01:27:54 with the intention of getting her out of there and like we pass all of her
01:27:57 schools all the time and she's just like, this is why we can't be here anymore.
01:28:00 Cause every time I see that high school, I want to burn it down.
01:28:03 So you need to get me away from it.
01:28:05 So, but yeah, I do think that'll help.
01:28:09 Um, obviously this, just the fact that you are, um, considering the
01:28:17 possibility that would be even better of a lifestyle, doesn't mean people
01:28:20 should give you any less money or that you don't need help.
01:28:23 Um, I mean, I, I mentioned in the wine chamber that I want people, I don't
01:28:26 want people to give me money because they think like they, they are being a charity
01:28:30 case.
01:28:31 I want to make work that people think is worth paying for.
01:28:34 So you, you want to make sure that people know that like if Patreon.com slash
01:28:39 save me is not about Tom needs the money.
01:28:42 It's not even safe anymore.
01:28:44 I changed it to slash Polystation too.
01:28:46 Cause I didn't, I didn't want to be, I think the joke kind of outlived itself at
01:28:49 this point.
01:28:51 Um, I think it's just the kind of meme that when you push it entirely yourself,
01:28:57 people aren't as receptive to it.
01:28:58 Yeah.
01:28:59 Like Patreon.com slash Ben St took off, I think more because other people were
01:29:03 like, like propping it up more than, uh, than him himself or not more so, but
01:29:10 like as much, um, your meme was too forced.
01:29:16 Unfortunately, I'm not good at comedy.
01:29:18 I, I don't think you're like bad at comedy.
01:29:21 I'm, I'm bad at like, I can do like off the cuff reactionary comedy, but I can't
01:29:26 like sit down and script a joke.
01:29:27 You're better at reacting to someone else's thing and piling onto it.
01:29:31 I would say like on PCP, that's your funniest shit is like quips, like response
01:29:36 quips that come out like, you know, exactly.
01:29:43 But, uh,
01:29:48 wrote that point of the interview with a quick draw word play, and I'm trying
01:29:51 to like remember what questions I need to ask you.
01:29:53 Like, what do I need to know about Tom?
01:29:56 Um, or do people need to know about Tom?
01:29:58 Um, okay.
01:30:00 So right now you consider yourself mostly a 3D graphic artist.
01:30:03 Yeah.
01:30:04 I mean, ever since I got a watch, we are the strange, like it's something
01:30:07 it's always been in the back of my mind.
01:30:09 Like this is kind of cool.
01:30:10 And I always thought conceptually it would be a good move to make because
01:30:15 like the hardest thing for me to do with drawing is, uh, foreshortening.
01:30:19 Like, like drawing anything in perspective is just like, uh, like that sort of shit.
01:30:24 It's just like, yeah, yeah, that specifically that that pose.
01:30:29 Exactly.
01:30:29 Um, so, so I've always been like, well, 3D, like that's all done for you.
01:30:34 Cause that's like the entire nature of it.
01:30:36 Like the extra, the seeds mentioned, it's not like that, right?
01:30:39 Well, I mean, it, it, it is essentially cause you don't, you make the model
01:30:43 and then you, the camera does all the foreshortening.
01:30:45 But you can't do like, you can't do certain things that you think you can.
01:30:49 Like that would be possible in 2D.
01:30:51 Yeah.
01:30:51 I mean, you can't like do like, cause like a lot of the crazy foreshortening
01:30:55 stuff is like breaking perspective.
01:30:57 You can, you can like, fudge it for sure.
01:30:59 And you can like change camera settings and stuff to kind of get like a crazy
01:31:02 dramatic kind of depth of field sort of thing.
01:31:05 But just in terms of just like, if I wanted to draw a person from an angle,
01:31:10 even if it's not like crazy foreshortening, like it's difficult for me,
01:31:13 but like 3D, you just do it.
01:31:15 So like it makes up for a weakness of mine.
01:31:17 Like I think just doing the 3D that I've done, like this is more how my
01:31:21 brain thinks of like objects.
01:31:23 Yeah.
01:31:23 Cause like you, you don't so much want to have to like, uh, draw the entire character
01:31:29 every time you just want to put the character in the goddamn environment
01:31:32 basically and like pose them.
01:31:33 And like, I think if you don't really need your care, like you tend to draw
01:31:37 your characters pretty consistently.
01:31:39 They're not like extremely expressive where they're going to be changing
01:31:43 expressions wildly from page to page or anything like that.
01:31:46 Like it's safe for them to just be models that could be posed enough.
01:31:49 And especially in like a fantasy story where, you know, like the facial
01:31:53 expressions are not driving the story.
01:31:55 Yeah.
01:31:55 It's not like, not like tech savory cartoons or anything like that.
01:31:59 It's pretty restrained.
01:32:01 Um, so it just, it works out really well.
01:32:03 And like, I've always loved that like low poly PS two kind of look.
01:32:07 Yeah.
01:32:08 I grew up with it.
01:32:09 I mean, I don't think, I think, I think doing low poly is probably going to
01:32:13 limit the, the reach of anything I do because I think most people, I think
01:32:17 there's nostalgia for like eight bit.
01:32:20 There's nostalgia for like that PS one kind of thing.
01:32:22 It's coming.
01:32:23 That the PS tune, cause the thing is that, uh, you know, you're 29, you're not
01:32:28 old enough to, to be nostalgia baiting yet.
01:32:32 Really.
01:32:32 You know, it's possible.
01:32:33 I'm just too ahead of the curve right now.
01:32:35 Okay.
01:32:35 Cause I did not grow up with any eight or 16 big games.
01:32:38 So I have no nostalgia for that shit.
01:32:40 Like for me, my era of playing those games is mostly the fucking on steam.
01:32:45 Like someone like Munchy, that motherfucker was born in 2000.
01:32:47 Like his first console is probably the fucking we, it was, you know, so like disgusting.
01:32:54 So for someone like him, you know, he'll be nostalgic for like Minecraft, you know,
01:33:01 which I mean Minecraft looks dated anyways, but he'll be nostalgic for it
01:33:05 because that was the, the zeitgeist of the time.
01:33:07 And I think that, you know, I mean, obviously you got Hippo who's
01:33:10 constantly talking about how like the PS two was the best era for graphics, you
01:33:15 know, like that's his whole fucking channel's identity.
01:33:18 It's like PS two is the only graphics I ever want to see.
01:33:21 So when you come out with Polystation two, it's like this, there's your target
01:33:24 audience is right there to give me like all this patron money and that'll be fine.
01:33:28 But, uh, do you have any concerns about the idea of trying to do a fantasy story
01:33:34 in CG?
01:33:35 Cause I've always felt that like one of the biggest problems I have with the
01:33:38 Berserk movies was that like, I thought that the extremely like wispy,
01:33:43 fanciful art of the manga did not really translate to anime.
01:33:47 But since you're not really adapting this from a source material, I think, I
01:33:51 mean, I really like one of, one of the, I really liked the, the PS
01:33:58 two JRPG, something like, like a Dragon Quest eight fuzzy piece in this night.
01:34:04 You didn't get it.
01:34:05 Oh God.
01:34:06 Where is it?
01:34:07 It's not very evident.
01:34:08 So it's hard to, oh, God, we got a mirror.
01:34:13 Herpaderb.
01:34:14 Yeah.
01:34:14 Um, I think because it's not an adaptation, like a building the
01:34:18 aesthetic from the ground up, I think it will probably be okay.
01:34:22 I'll definitely be like making sure that it doesn't become too ugly or anything.
01:34:26 How did you translate your drawing style into 3D?
01:34:29 Cause you've done your 3D art looks just like your 2D art.
01:34:33 The only big concession I had to make was like making the eyes a little bit
01:34:37 smaller and there were ways I could have gotten around that.
01:34:40 But the thing is like I'm doing everything super low poly and like the
01:34:44 eye socket in the model has eight points to define it.
01:34:48 So when I stretch it to that big, it looks basically like a really ugly
01:34:51 octagon and it doesn't look right.
01:34:53 But when you have a smaller sort of eye, it kind of reads more
01:34:55 smoothly.
01:34:56 I see.
01:34:57 Um, I could have done it as a texture, but I wanted to give it that flexibility
01:35:00 because the way I do all the expression is something called shape keys.
01:35:03 So like you have the basis of the face, just kind of neutral.
01:35:06 And then you make a new key and then you pull the point.
01:35:09 So it looks more like an expression.
01:35:11 Then you have a slider that kind of transitions between those two.
01:35:14 That's how the face morphs from one expression to another.
01:35:16 Okay.
01:35:17 So you can make the faces move and everything like in real time in your comic.
01:35:22 Um, that's cool.
01:35:24 I don't know why I'm like impressed with that.
01:35:26 Like that's not normal, but I mean, I was like, whoa, you can make their mouths
01:35:30 move like for in my mind that I was like reacting that strong.
01:35:33 I got like a thing of false, like going through a couple of different expression
01:35:37 loops on, on Instagram came out pretty good.
01:35:40 So fuck, I forgot how I wanted to phrase this.
01:35:44 So yeah, your art style is so particular.
01:35:48 How much of that is like, you have to draw that way and how much of it is
01:35:51 you want to draw that way?
01:35:53 You know, it's interesting because now that I'm doing 3d and I feel so much
01:35:57 more comfortable with it, like a lot of that was just like, this is just how
01:36:00 it's coming out, but like I'm doing a couple of models right now that they're
01:36:04 not like super different.
01:36:06 Cause like I did the thing, the way the 3d like work throw works is that you
01:36:10 work off a reference image.
01:36:12 So you get like a front and a side view and then you kind of model from both
01:36:15 angles and it makes a 3d version of it.
01:36:18 And like the techniques I could apply to anything, like I could get like, you
01:36:22 know, anybody's art of a front and side view and I could reconstruct it.
01:36:25 Right.
01:36:26 Um, but I'm making sure like I'm doing like Bayonetta right now is like the
01:36:29 next big model I'm working on.
01:36:31 I could just gotten like a, you know, from the design Bible for Bayonetta
01:36:34 modeled off that, but like I redrew it myself because I wanted it to be my
01:36:37 proportions and my kind of art style.
01:36:39 So there's definitely like, um, I'm doing that because I feel like that's my
01:36:44 identity and I like it.
01:36:46 Um, cause I don't want to just like turn into like, I don't want it to
01:36:49 become just technical of just like, yo, I can like recreate other people's stuff.
01:36:54 Do you think that your, um, like art style is going to radically shift as you
01:37:00 one of the, one of the big things that is coming right now is I'm going to start
01:37:04 using way more color.
01:37:06 I've, I've been super big into black and white forever.
01:37:09 Yeah.
01:37:09 Your aesthetic has always been very, my big push now, cause like what I really
01:37:13 love about 3ds, I love that like that low poly like hand painted like world of
01:37:17 warcraft is so fucking gorgeous.
01:37:19 It's fucking great.
01:37:20 So I'm starting to, oh, if you, dude, if you can create some, like I, your
01:37:24 art style is pretty close to that.
01:37:26 Like your Trixie pub is very world of warcraft ish.
01:37:30 Anybody who doesn't know we're talking about, there was a Trixie comic.
01:37:33 We were talking about it before the camera died that, um, that you had made
01:37:37 this like towards the tail end of doing like, basically you quit the pony YouTube
01:37:43 shit and then we're like, I'm going to do this comic and then you worked on it for
01:37:46 a couple of months and then it switched over to sorceress loss.
01:37:49 I guess because I was saying in the other video, it's just like the, I wanted, I
01:37:54 had like this autistic obsession with keeping all my fan content, like non
01:38:00 conflicting with Canon and then like they shotgun ruined a bunch of ideas that
01:38:03 were going to happen.
01:38:04 Like the whole story of the Trixie arc, she was going to go into the every
01:38:07 forest and find like, like all this crazy shit.
01:38:09 Then they like retcon like, oh, we're just in the Everfree and we figured out
01:38:12 all that shit and what it is.
01:38:13 I'm like, well, that whole story is just torpedoed.
01:38:15 So I was just like, well, all the passion died with that.
01:38:18 And then like the more stuff I did, like the more I like, kind of like we're
01:38:21 sort of tweaking little things.
01:38:22 Like I wanted to like Celestine Luna to be made way more like gods and stuff.
01:38:25 Cause like I thought that was like a cool idea from the first season that
01:38:28 they totally fucked up after that.
01:38:30 So then I was like, why don't I just make my own thing where like there are
01:38:32 gods and they are gods and they do God shit.
01:38:35 Yeah.
01:38:35 So like that's what it is.
01:38:36 There's like 13 big countries and they all ruled by a God and they all have
01:38:40 different cultures and stuff.
01:38:41 And like, so it just, I just started running with it and like it came,
01:38:44 it became way better.
01:38:45 Yeah.
01:38:46 So, um, I don't know if this is the same technique that you use for the
01:38:50 motion comic and sorceress loss, but in the Trixie comic, while it was a two
01:38:54 dimensional comic, all the backgrounds were 3D environments you created that so
01:38:59 that you could just, you know, put a character against an environment and
01:39:02 from whatever angle and just shoot it easily.
01:39:04 Again, you're much more into just having the elements rather than having to draw
01:39:08 them 2000 times differently.
01:39:12 But the pub is very World of Warcraft looking now that you've mentioned it.
01:39:18 And I think if you could nail that, like not just, just World of Warcraft, but
01:39:23 if you could nail an aesthetic like that, I do think people would be really
01:39:25 attracted to that.
01:39:26 Well, I found out, well, I knew about it, but I learned how to start doing it.
01:39:30 Like the FOSS model, like I did, I, all of that was painted directly on the
01:39:35 model because there's a way of doing it.
01:39:36 But usually like you unwrap a model, like you put seams in it and you flatten
01:39:39 it out like a papercraft doll and then you like kind of like texture it on the
01:39:42 flatten thing.
01:39:43 And then when you put it back, it wraps around, but like blender has a thing
01:39:46 where you can just take a brush and just draw right on the model on the screen.
01:39:51 So you can get a lot more subtlety going on there.
01:39:52 Cause like you don't have to like kind of like think abstract, like how will this
01:39:56 look when it's wrapped back up?
01:39:57 Yeah, you just like draw right on it.
01:39:59 And like I'm just painting.
01:40:00 I just painted the whole thing and it looked really nice.
01:40:04 And like I've never really done much with color, but I'm going to try
01:40:07 experimenting with that.
01:40:08 Probably a lot faster than building a whole texture to wrap around.
01:40:11 Right.
01:40:11 Yeah.
01:40:12 I mean, yeah, it's more, it's faster cause it's more intuitive.
01:40:15 Like you don't have to like think like, okay, like part of the foot's over there.
01:40:18 Part of the arms up here.
01:40:19 How am I going to make them mesh together?
01:40:20 You just, just draw.
01:40:22 It's much more natural.
01:40:24 Um, so that's, that's really exciting, but I'm doing a lot of experiments with that.
01:40:28 Like one of the first things I did actually, I did like a 3D reconstruction of
01:40:32 the first room from Undertale and Frisk and that was all hand painted too.
01:40:37 That looked pretty cool.
01:40:38 So I'm just like, yeah, yeah, it's going to be dope.
01:40:40 All right.
01:40:41 Let's take a short break.
01:40:42 Cause I got a piss and get another drink and we'll come right back.
01:40:46 I don't know, dude.
01:40:47 All right, Tom, we've asked you about your influences, your art, your plans for the
01:40:53 future.
01:40:54 Do you, would you say that you currently see yourself as having like, uh, are you
01:41:00 living project to project or is there something like is, or would you say that,
01:41:05 uh, you're more focused on the big project?
01:41:08 Uh, in terms of like, like art, art project wise, like, uh, I find myself, if
01:41:13 I'm working on a big thing, then it's like, that's what I'm doing.
01:41:17 And like, there's other things that come out, but the big thing is the important
01:41:20 thing and other times it's just like, uh, well, it's a new week.
01:41:25 What am I going to make next?
01:41:27 Yeah.
01:41:27 Well, my problem is that I flip flop constantly between like, should I run
01:41:32 myself as a business or should I be an artist that's like destined to kill
01:41:37 myself or something?
01:41:38 Cause, cause like so hard, like business wise, business wise, I should be like
01:41:42 just pumping out more fan art, trying to get my name out there, build a
01:41:45 personal brand and like build an audience.
01:41:47 So like when I said, oh, I'm going to start doing original work, like I have
01:41:50 like a thousand dollars a month based on my art and like a huge following to
01:41:53 actually support it.
01:41:55 Uh, but the artist in me is just like, fuck that, that stuff's never going to
01:41:59 take off because your passion isn't in there.
01:42:01 You should just like let your passion shine through on like something you're
01:42:04 actually super fucking invested in, even if it's like a smaller thing.
01:42:07 I mean, I think that's the way to go.
01:42:09 But I mean, I'm one to talk cause I, I, your, your, your passion
01:42:14 happens to be insanely like marketable.
01:42:17 I, you know, not anymore because like I, I found myself, we can't, we
01:42:25 can't control the audience that, that props us up.
01:42:28 Unfortunately.
01:42:29 Yeah.
01:42:29 I mean, it's just a simple matter of that.
01:42:32 I was more willing to, not even that I'm more willing to, but like less ambitious.
01:42:39 It's like the more ambitious you are, the harder it's going to be because, um,
01:42:43 if you want to communicate a really complicated idea, then you probably
01:42:48 can't do that in a simplistic way.
01:42:50 I don't know, like it's not, you can't just sit down in front of a video and
01:42:54 explain the entire plot of sorceress lost and have people care about sorceress
01:42:59 lost, you know, um, on some level, they might be interested in it, but cause
01:43:04 yeah, I've done that before.
01:43:06 I've been like, Hey, here's the plot of some novel I've got an idea for.
01:43:09 And people are like, wow, I'd love to see that, you know, but while you're not
01:43:12 getting it cause it's just an idea, um, feel free to steal it.
01:43:17 So you're just kind of bouncing between those two streams all the time.
01:43:22 It's, it's, it's complicated because like ideally in a perfect world, like I
01:43:26 wouldn't have financial obligations, you know, cause it's even the problem is
01:43:30 like, even if I like drop off the face of the earth and live in a, in a van, I
01:43:34 still have student debt.
01:43:35 So I'm going to have to defer on all of that to actually like make it work.
01:43:41 What does that do?
01:43:42 Uh, you basically just like, I can get like a deferment.
01:43:45 So it's still gaining interest, but you're not required to pay it back at that point.
01:43:49 So you're just basically like, owing more money so you don't have to pay it right
01:43:54 now.
01:43:55 Okay.
01:43:56 But in the future, you will have to pay it.
01:43:58 Right.
01:43:59 So you just got to try to make a big thing right now before you got to pay my only
01:44:03 scheme, but Trump, Trump's America seems to be on its way to ruining it is that
01:44:07 they have a thing right now where if you're poor for 15 years, they'll forgive
01:44:10 your federal loans.
01:44:11 I'm like halfway through that right now.
01:44:12 Oh yeah.
01:44:13 And, uh, and if Trump has his way, that's going to go away.
01:44:16 And then I'm going to go fucking shoot up the White House cause fuck you, you
01:44:19 ruined my long game here, you dick.
01:44:23 So for what it's worth, that was satire.
01:44:25 Yeah.
01:44:26 Yeah.
01:44:26 Yeah.
01:44:26 I heard that the secret service shows up at your house.
01:44:29 I mean, half the secret service would support me if I did that at this point.
01:44:34 Um, yeah, I don't know.
01:44:37 It's just, I would like to just do that.
01:44:40 Just like focus on that one thing.
01:44:42 Cause like I'm someone who's like really just unit task minded.
01:44:45 Like I can't, like I had a schedule for a while where I'd like on this day, I'll
01:44:49 do this project.
01:44:50 And I'll just see all this project and I just end up doing nothing cause my
01:44:52 brain was too scattered.
01:44:54 Like what I'm doing right now, which is working a little bit better is that like
01:44:57 I'm just going to do this one thing until it's done and move on to the next
01:45:00 thing until that's done.
01:45:01 Yeah.
01:45:02 And I just, I don't know, simple, simple, just like doing this and it makes it
01:45:07 better to get done.
01:45:09 Um, what do you think is the current, like, uh, let's say six months from now,
01:45:18 what do you think your content is going to look like?
01:45:22 Like what can people expect?
01:45:23 Cause like for me, um, one of the harder things about following you as a content
01:45:27 creator is that you've changed gears so many times.
01:45:30 I never know if you're planning to stay there.
01:45:33 Right.
01:45:33 No, it's, it's bad.
01:45:34 Like my personal brand's a mess, which was the name of that last wine chamber.
01:45:38 My personal brand's a mess, but it's not pity.
01:45:40 Uh, yeah, I need to just like really, that's why I wanted to get, take the, get
01:45:45 off work and take these next couple of months.
01:45:46 Like really just like hammer away a game plan.
01:45:48 Like the, the biggest, like fucking breakthrough of like the last 10 years has
01:45:52 been like, I enjoy making art and not just the finest finished product, which
01:45:57 has never happened.
01:45:58 Like it's, it's like the fucking craziest, God damn shit.
01:46:02 Cause you were saying like, Oh, you just like look for all these shortcuts.
01:46:05 The shortcuts were because I hated doing it.
01:46:07 Yeah.
01:46:07 Now that's, I mean, that's the thing is that if you try to work in a medium that
01:46:12 you don't enjoy doing the thing, then it's always going to fail.
01:46:17 And the interesting thing is fucking sucks.
01:46:19 I'd done it for so long that I thought it was just cause I was lazy, but I'm not.
01:46:26 I mean, I am lazy, but that's the hardest part is that like there, everybody,
01:46:30 everybody's lazy about doing shit.
01:46:31 They don't want to do, you know, and like for me, when I wanted to be an
01:46:35 author or a filmmaker and all that stuff, like I didn't realize that when I was
01:46:39 a teenager, like there was a solid year and a half.
01:46:41 I wanted to be a filmmaker and I never made any fucking films.
01:46:44 And at the end of that, I had to go, well, clearly I'm not a fucking filmmaker
01:46:47 cause I had all the time and opportunities and like, I just didn't do it.
01:46:51 So meanwhile, like anime blogging was just happening naturally, you know, and I feel
01:46:55 like if you can find something that you just enjoy doing it and there's any way
01:47:01 it could be marketable, it's worth exploring.
01:47:03 And if it's not marketable, well, you got a fun hobby making fucking PS2.
01:47:09 Well, that's like kind of why I want to take these
01:47:11 couple of months because like I have no, I'll have no responsibility, nothing else.
01:47:14 So if I can't do it in this situation, there's no way it's going to happen when
01:47:18 other things are added on top.
01:47:19 If you can't bust your own ass.
01:47:21 I mean, they always say that like having the rug pulled out from under you is a
01:47:26 good way to hit the ground running.
01:47:29 I don't know if anybody's ever like premeditated that to the extent that this is
01:47:33 though, but I mean, the whole thing is just like, I just, I can't.
01:47:39 It's really, I fantasized about the things that's happening to you have happening
01:47:43 to me back when I was a teenager.
01:47:45 Like I wanted to run away and thought like, oh, if I like, if I have to bust
01:47:49 my ass, I'll work, you know, but I never did, obviously.
01:47:55 But I'm real curious if it'll.
01:47:57 Yeah, I mean, ideally, like if I could get myself into one thing that I'm slowly
01:48:02 like trying to do is like delegation and like trying to like, I want to work
01:48:05 with other people because like I said earlier, like I bust my ass way harder
01:48:09 like working for a PCP than I do for myself.
01:48:12 Like I would not, I would not sit down and make a hundred t-shirts for myself.
01:48:17 Like I'll do it for PCP because it's a bigger thing that I believe in outside.
01:48:21 But if I like doing like Polystation to branded shirts, I'm like, just go on
01:48:24 red bubble, pay double.
01:48:25 I don't give a fuck.
01:48:26 Yeah.
01:48:26 It also can be really, it can be way easier to just riff off of someone else's
01:48:30 thing, you know, like it's easier to come up with ideas if it's like someone has
01:48:35 already set up the baseline and you're just like riffing off of that baseline.
01:48:39 It's not even like, like the, the idea part.
01:48:41 It's because I, when I think of myself and my work, it's just me.
01:48:48 And so like, because I don't think too highly of myself yet, I can't get too
01:48:52 excited about it, but like when I work with PCP or just with anybody else,
01:48:56 like I remember I did a project with my buddy, like right after college.
01:49:00 And like we both busted our ass for a week because like, and I worked hard
01:49:03 because it was like, this isn't just me, like it's something bigger than me now.
01:49:07 I'm working towards something larger than just like my like, you know,
01:49:11 artistic masturbation.
01:49:12 Do you think you're okay with like a life where it was never like, oh,
01:49:16 I did it all by myself?
01:49:18 Well, that was a, that was something I'm letting go of.
01:49:20 I was super obsessed with that.
01:49:22 Like I wouldn't want, like I'd rather do this bad than myself and get it done.
01:49:26 Right.
01:49:26 But now I'm just like, it's been 10 years of that and nothing's been done.
01:49:30 So like now I'm just like, I'd rather have something done than something not done.
01:49:32 Right.
01:49:33 I met at the point now where like, I continually hire the DeVoo because even
01:49:39 though I've been getting better as an editor, so has he.
01:49:42 And it's like, you know, that, that's the kind of delegation where at the time
01:49:47 that I hired him, everyone in the PCP was terrified of hiring editors
01:49:50 because we were all like, oh, I want to have, I want it to all be my personal
01:49:53 mark. It has to be me, me, me.
01:49:54 It has to be like my perfect vision.
01:49:56 But then I just found a guy who kind of understood my vision.
01:50:00 But at the time I was writing stuff that's nowhere near as advanced as
01:50:02 like what Jesse was doing where Jesse was like, oh, I can't hire an editor
01:50:05 because like he won't understand my vision.
01:50:07 And I'm like, well, yeah, you're doing like a really complicated thing,
01:50:10 which is more fun to edit anyways.
01:50:12 Like ironically, it's more fun to edit something that forces you to be creative
01:50:16 and think about it.
01:50:18 But because of the fact that DeVoo's been editing for me for so long that now
01:50:24 if I do want to give him something more advanced, that's like, oh, this is more
01:50:27 of my personal vision thing.
01:50:29 Like he can, he can deliver on my vision better than I can because I can
01:50:34 just describe it to him and he'll show me something and I'll be like, well,
01:50:36 that's way cooler than how I had imagined it.
01:50:38 You know, I mean, that's, that's like the advice they give you.
01:50:41 You want to hire people better than yourself.
01:50:43 And like that's what I want to do.
01:50:44 Like it really starts with just being honest.
01:50:47 Like I would love like my ideal situation.
01:50:51 I'd love to do something like, like Ruby where like I'm like the creative
01:50:55 director and I'm doing, like I want to still be in the trenches and like doing
01:50:58 a lot of the modeling and like doing story.
01:51:00 Ruby right there is proof that that brand of PS2 model is popular.
01:51:04 Especially it's low poly as fuck, right?
01:51:06 The newer ones have gotten better, but the initial ones, they were pretty rough.
01:51:10 And like, I remember watching like the first, I just watched Ruby a little
01:51:12 while ago and I was like, oh my God, this is aesthetics on point.
01:51:15 And then they changed to my, I was like, oh, it's looks so modern.
01:51:18 What happened?
01:51:19 I definitely can say I like your models more than the Ruby models.
01:51:24 Well, the Ruby models were like, what, like 10 years ago or something
01:51:27 like that at this point.
01:51:29 Shit.
01:51:30 Um, okay.
01:51:33 Uh, well, now I want to ask you some more philosophical questions, I guess.
01:51:39 Okay.
01:51:40 Uh, like, you know, how do you see the world?
01:51:45 How is the world right now?
01:51:46 How are things?
01:51:48 Okay.
01:51:48 Um, like in terms of just society, how do you think is going things going in
01:51:54 a direction that you, uh, that is good.
01:51:57 Well, okay.
01:51:58 I don't think the reaction things are going is like necessarily good for anybody,
01:52:01 but like, have you felt yourself like burdened with the, the, the foibles of
01:52:07 modern society much, or are you more just like concerned about your shit?
01:52:11 Um, I'm kind of like torn on this because like there's, there's, I definitely
01:52:17 feel like, I think I brought this up on a PCP episode once where I was saying how
01:52:22 like, because of social media and like the internet and stuff, like.
01:52:27 Our, our like, uh, scale in which we can judge our personal ability has
01:52:32 like been expanded like a thousand fold.
01:52:34 You know, that's kind of what I adjusted at the start of that deer artist
01:52:37 video is like, there's so many people online who legitimately deserve to be
01:52:41 famous and you're competing with all of them.
01:52:43 Right.
01:52:44 Like all of us, if we were just like new, like the people in our city, we'd all
01:52:48 be like the 99th percentile of what we do, but the problem is we're online and
01:52:53 it's like, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of you're, you're in the biggest pond.
01:52:57 Like, I mean, you can be within a sub pond of like, Oh, I'm the biggest pony guy
01:53:01 or I'm the biggest anime guy or whatever.
01:53:03 But like, you know, you're still a small fish in the YouTube pond of guys with
01:53:08 millions of subscribers.
01:53:09 So, I mean, it's the same thing with art or anything else.
01:53:13 Any, any niche, like you're just, you're competing on, on like a global level.
01:53:19 And the problem is because all the cream rises to the crop, the top 1% feels
01:53:25 like normal.
01:53:26 And so when you're not the top 1%, you feel inadequate when you really
01:53:29 shouldn't be.
01:53:30 No, I mean, like, yeah, you're constantly looking at shit that's better than yours.
01:53:36 Yeah, like you can't help it.
01:53:37 But like for me, the way that I process that information is, I have to get as
01:53:41 good as that guy.
01:53:42 Right.
01:53:43 How do you feel when you see that stuff?
01:53:45 Well, it's interesting because up until I started doing 3D, I would feel
01:53:49 miserable, but now I just get jazzed.
01:53:51 Like, this is fucking dope.
01:53:53 And for some, I guess it's just like a mindset change of just like, I feel
01:53:57 like this medium is within my grasp.
01:53:59 Like I could do that with enough application of effort, whereas with drawing
01:54:04 and stuff, it never felt like I would, would get there.
01:54:07 Yeah.
01:54:07 So it's definitely been a big project can get done within a timely enough fashion
01:54:12 that they will make sense and be like positive experiences to have worked on.
01:54:16 I mean, I don't know.
01:54:17 I, the big mystery for me is always like the marketing aspect because I feel
01:54:21 like despite all the best practices and stuff, there's always a degree of luck.
01:54:24 Like because that aspect, you can't control it.
01:54:28 Like I can't control people coming to me.
01:54:30 I can't control you liking what I do.
01:54:32 And I mean, I think there's also a strong element though of like, uh, you, you
01:54:37 can't, you might not be able to make them drink, but you can lead the horse to
01:54:40 water at the very least by like just making people understand.
01:54:44 Like I think when people talk about having a personal narrative online and
01:54:47 everything, like this has been construed as like be a vlogger and be a fun
01:54:53 online persona.
01:54:54 But I think the main thing people just want to know is like, why do you care
01:54:57 so much about this goddamn thing?
01:54:59 Well, there's a, there's a, it's a great, I think we had to talk about this.
01:55:02 I told you about Simon Sinek when he says people, people buy why you do things,
01:55:06 not what you do.
01:55:06 Yeah.
01:55:07 It's so true.
01:55:08 It's, it is definitely.
01:55:09 I mean, especially for me, like a lot of my audience is about the why of like
01:55:14 and that's something I really kind of want to get more into on Polystation
01:55:19 too, which is kind of the reason why I kind of think maybe pivoting away from
01:55:22 fan art.
01:55:22 Cause like if I, I think that if I did an impassioned rant or something,
01:55:25 I mean, like how, why fan art sucks or like not even being that blunt about it,
01:55:29 but like why like the artistic integrity is important.
01:55:32 I think there's a group of people that would really resonate with that.
01:55:35 Certainly.
01:55:36 I, I also think that you, uh, yeah.
01:55:40 If you did more original content, it would just show more.
01:55:43 I think people want to know like what's the message you're trying to send.
01:55:46 Like I know a lot of random things about source or a slosh,
01:55:49 but I don't know what the themes are, you know?
01:55:51 So that's like kind of the problem is I don't think enough people know what
01:55:55 you're trying to explore with your work, you know, like it, or even if you know
01:55:59 what you're trying to explore with your work, do you, do you have like a strong
01:56:02 sense of like what, I mean, the, the theme, the theme of, of the story is actually
01:56:07 like, I guess it's ironically kind of similar to what I've been doing.
01:56:10 It's like there's, there's, there's another, another way of accomplishing
01:56:13 what you want to do.
01:56:14 Cause like the main thrust of it is that Sarah's in a world of mages or a
01:56:18 culture of mages and she can't do magic.
01:56:21 And so like she wants to be like a great mage or whatever.
01:56:23 So she goes to all these other countries outside of hers and like each country
01:56:28 has a different culture and there's different ways of doing magic.
01:56:32 And she kind of becomes like this amalgamation of all these different
01:56:35 schools of thought and becomes like better and stronger that way.
01:56:40 And it's going to be like this cultural clash between her and her
01:56:43 brother, who like is very traditionalist from her culture and like how they
01:56:47 play off of each other and things like that.
01:56:49 And like a lot of more, more is going to happen.
01:56:50 And is this more like down to earth or does this expand in like story scope?
01:56:55 Like, does it, is there a war?
01:56:57 You know, I distinctly wanted to make it not like a chosen one on the world
01:57:01 in the brink of war kind of story.
01:57:03 The entire like culture is stable.
01:57:06 Okay.
01:57:06 So it's just going to be exploring like these different cultures, like being
01:57:10 able to look at a fantasy world that's not like unstable.
01:57:14 I'm like, it's closer to like a My Little Pony tonality.
01:57:18 Like, yeah, because I mean, that's where it came from at the end of the day.
01:57:21 It's just like a world where I still find that so refreshing.
01:57:24 There's a lot of politics and magic and everything, but it's not violent.
01:57:28 Yeah.
01:57:29 I mean, there can be violence.
01:57:30 Like in isolated cases, like there's a certain short story I want to tell.
01:57:34 Like I want to like challenge like perceptions and stuff because like she
01:57:36 comes from this culture where magic is like the be all end all.
01:57:40 And then like there's going to be cities like we're like magics look down upon.
01:57:43 Like there's going to be a whole like culture that's basically going to be kind
01:57:46 of like steampunk where they're like, like they're basically going to be like
01:57:49 what atheists would be in a world where gods exist.
01:57:51 Like fuck God, I don't want to have anything to do with them.
01:57:53 So they reject magic because magic is like the power of the gods.
01:57:56 So like just make technology and but the gods are literally real.
01:57:59 Yes.
01:58:00 They, they, they're the rulers of each of each country.
01:58:03 So, okay.
01:58:05 Well, that's interesting.
01:58:06 It's more than I've ever known about the long-term plot of Sorcerer's loss.
01:58:10 I mean, that's because it just kind of got finalized a little while ago.
01:58:12 It was a lot different before.
01:58:14 Um, but like the original one of the, it was, it's funny.
01:58:18 Like it's the original plot was going to be like sometimes you just like have to
01:58:23 like realize your limitations.
01:58:25 And I think a big problem is that because I don't believe that at all.
01:58:27 Yeah.
01:58:28 And so like,
01:58:28 No, you got that girl in the gun.
01:58:30 Yeah.
01:58:30 So go beyond the impossible, maybe impossible possible.
01:58:33 So I was just like, eh, it didn't resonate.
01:58:35 So I had to go back and scrap that and redo it.
01:58:37 And like this is, and it's funny because like as I was developing the story,
01:58:41 like it happened with my own life because like 3ds, I'm going to push these
01:58:44 barriers that I couldn't do before.
01:58:46 So it's like, huh.
01:58:47 Yeah.
01:58:47 How badly do you wish you'd got into 3d art like four years ago or 10 years ago?
01:58:54 Well, you know, that the, the, the, the technology has advanced to a place where
01:58:59 like it's definitely more feasible to do it now than it was then.
01:59:03 And also like, there were a couple like key YouTube videos that like kind of
01:59:07 unlocked a way of doing it that I kind of wrapped my brain around that if I
01:59:11 hadn't decided to do it now, I might not have stumbled across and I might not have
01:59:14 been able to push to where I am at this point.
01:59:16 So I try, like even with, with like all these rewrites of SL and stuff,
01:59:21 like it's going to be so much better than it would have been if I had just
01:59:23 pushed through with it before.
01:59:25 So there is a part of me that's like grateful that it had extra time to incubate.
01:59:29 Yeah.
01:59:29 I mean, in a lot of ways, um, people always say you have to get like your
01:59:33 first story out there.
01:59:34 You have to get, you have to, like, like Munchie was saying in the podcast,
01:59:38 you and him did, I don't know what the release order of any of this shit's
01:59:40 going to be, but, uh, you and Munchie did a podcast about, uh, do you know what
01:59:45 that video is going to be called?
01:59:46 Art, apologies, you know, in the art, apologies, um, podcast.
01:59:50 Munchie was talking about how you need to get your early work out of the way
01:59:52 because it's always going to be your worst and like you can keep making it
01:59:54 better, but then the paradox that, uh, the longer you work on it, the better
01:59:58 it gets, but in a lot of ways you've just created multiple stories.
02:00:02 Like by the time the, the story I wrote as a, as a novel, like I said,
02:00:06 originally it was going to be a movie.
02:00:07 I spent like two years redeveloping it until it was a book.
02:00:11 And by that point it was yet vastly better than the pre, than what it would have
02:00:14 been.
02:00:14 And if I made it again now, it would be two, but it would also just be another story.
02:00:18 Like the same character is the same plot, but it's not the same story.
02:00:22 You know, I mean, I've written other stuff.
02:00:26 So it's not like this is my first rodeo on writing a story.
02:00:28 Right.
02:00:28 And it's also, but I'm just saying that like, even if none of this stuff's been
02:00:31 published, like silently in the background, you're grinding the power level,
02:00:35 which used to be how it was, like most people didn't crack the scene till they
02:00:39 were of a certain power level.
02:00:42 Now it's like all your old shit can be on your DeviantArt.
02:00:45 Some people try to cover that stuff up, but I'm one of those people.
02:00:49 All my old Deviantarts are gone.
02:00:50 You'll never see them.
02:00:51 What's the farthest back of your content that's viewable online?
02:00:54 Uh, well, I actually just axed all my pony work off of DeviantArt a couple
02:00:57 weeks ago, so, uh, like two years ago, it's the longest it goes back.
02:01:02 Um, is that true on like all social media or the, okay, but to clarify,
02:01:05 the reason that I decided to, to get rid of the pony stuff wasn't even
02:01:09 because I was super embarrassed by it.
02:01:10 It was because I didn't want that metadata to fuck up with anything that's
02:01:13 going forward.
02:01:15 I didn't remove my pony videos out of embarrassment either.
02:01:18 It was just like, for a while, I'm like an anime channel that has like three
02:01:22 rows of anime videos and then pages of pony videos.
02:01:26 And I was like, these all need to go.
02:01:27 That was the thing, cause like I'm rebranding is like all those 3D stuff.
02:01:30 And then you go back and there's all this pony stuff and it doesn't make any sense.
02:01:33 And like, because like all these things are driven by algorithms now,
02:01:36 traffic to that is going to fuck up directing where you're supposed to go.
02:01:40 Oh God, they're ruining the internet.
02:01:42 It's really bad.
02:01:42 They're ruining the fucking internet.
02:01:44 And the only reason that the only thing that's going to save it is that everyone
02:01:47 knows they're doing it.
02:01:48 That's how we can all escape.
02:01:50 Um, all right, how long, how far are we into this?
02:01:54 Could I am running out of questions?
02:01:58 Well, is there anything, anything?
02:01:59 Cause I don't want to ask you about any broad topic stuff cause we talk about
02:02:02 enough of that on the PCP right now.
02:02:06 Is there anything else you want to share?
02:02:08 I guess like going back to what we were saying about like how we feel about like
02:02:11 society or whatever, like how that shit goes.
02:02:13 I think there's a lot of negative that comes on with this whole internet shit.
02:02:17 But like we were saying before, like, you know, the last generation couldn't do
02:02:21 what we're doing.
02:02:21 Like there's no way that, like, can you imagine like, like the ridiculousness
02:02:26 of like, Oh, like five friends are sitting around a table having a discussion
02:02:29 and you get like almost a grand for it.
02:02:31 I mean, like the, this whole setup that we're currently in right now is exceedingly
02:02:37 strange.
02:02:38 Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous.
02:02:40 Renting a house to make like to fly six guys in and make YouTube videos for 10
02:02:46 days.
02:02:46 Like it's utterly nuts and definitely it couldn't have existed before.
02:02:51 Yeah.
02:02:51 So I know we all give social media a lot of shit, but like,
02:02:55 I, I'm also like really just grateful that like, I'm, I really, I like being the
02:03:01 age that I am because I'm like young enough to be able to take advantage of
02:03:06 all this, but old enough to understand like how important it is.
02:03:10 Oh yeah.
02:03:10 How like to not take it for granted.
02:03:12 Right.
02:03:12 Yeah.
02:03:13 So.
02:03:14 But at the same time, I feel as though we are just too old to understand certain
02:03:18 like why things become trendy on social media.
02:03:21 For sure.
02:03:22 There's definitely a disconnect.
02:03:23 Like every once in a while, um, I'll just like hear some new song that's like all
02:03:30 over Vine and I'm like, why, why, why this is just is not my generation.
02:03:36 I guess, you know, that's, I, I definitely am terrified of growing old just because
02:03:41 of like, I'm terrified of death in general.
02:03:43 I remember that like, you know, there's always people your age, like people,
02:03:47 people act like if you, um, I mean, granted, like teenagers are the most
02:03:51 interested in art because they need it to like understand the world around them.
02:03:55 And they have tons of free time, but like adults still consume it and they want shit
02:03:59 for them.
02:04:00 I'm just terrified of dying.
02:04:02 Yeah.
02:04:03 Well, that's pretty bad.
02:04:05 I mean, we're all terrified of dying.
02:04:06 Me, I think it's just because I haven't done what I want to do yet.
02:04:09 Like I think if I can get enough shit out of me, I'd be like, if I died tomorrow,
02:04:13 like it, it take a lot because like for me, there's so much.
02:04:18 Well, that's a whole problem.
02:04:19 It's like, there's, there's, I'm never, my brain's never going to turn off.
02:04:21 There's always going to be another idea.
02:04:23 So like, I'm going to die unfulfilled somehow.
02:04:25 I really want you to read, um, or maybe I sent this to you.
02:04:28 I don't even remember.
02:04:29 Did you read a thing, um, by this comic artist about like how he wasted 14 years
02:04:34 or whatever drawing this comic that was only supposed to take five and like his
02:04:37 tips on how to not do that?
02:04:40 Um, possibly was a YouTube video.
02:04:43 No, it's recent.
02:04:44 It's fairly recent.
02:04:45 It was a, it was a blog post, but it was a, I saw a video kind of
02:04:49 similar to that or no, it was a YouTube video.
02:04:51 I'm wrong.
02:04:52 It was a YouTube video.
02:04:53 I think I watched that.
02:04:54 It was like, and it was like kind of like an edutainment video, but it was a,
02:04:58 a guy who was a comic artist who had spent like an obscene amount of time over a
02:05:02 decade drawing like this three volume comic.
02:05:04 And it was because he copied the style of like, um, oh yeah, because he did all
02:05:10 that super insane patching and stuff.
02:05:11 Yeah, I did watch it.
02:05:12 Yeah, but then he talks about like where you need to cut to like, he's like,
02:05:15 pick your battles.
02:05:16 Like this shot was not important and didn't need to be shot in a location that
02:05:20 had four layers of detail.
02:05:22 Uh, I will not do that next time, but the most fascinating part was when he was
02:05:26 talking about like, so this took me this many years.
02:05:30 And that means that if I only do three more comics than that, or if I, if I
02:05:35 keep doing comments at this rate, I will only get three done before I die.
02:05:38 And I have more than three ideas.
02:05:40 And, uh, do you ever find yourself like, do you worry about that?
02:05:43 Especially with like sorceress, that's like my number one thing.
02:05:47 Like, I remember yesterday when I was on my way here, I was like, do I really
02:05:52 have a week to spare?
02:05:53 Like, should I just be working right now?
02:05:55 Cause I have like two models like that have just been in limbo.
02:05:58 I feel very similar because like two weeks for the last two weeks, I've done
02:06:01 nothing, but read the guilty.
02:06:03 Get wiki.
02:06:04 God damn fucking lecture.
02:06:06 And I still have all of XR to get through for me.
02:06:08 It was the dick show like days and days.
02:06:11 And I was like sick of it.
02:06:12 And I was, I was, I was talking to my friend.
02:06:14 He's like, why the fuck are you even doing this?
02:06:16 All fighting game stories are retarded.
02:06:17 I'm like, I mean, you're right.
02:06:19 But I said, I said, I do hard stories for target.
02:06:22 It's got 150,000 views.
02:06:24 So dude, this lecture, the first, the first half an hour is a hundred years
02:06:28 before the first game because that's, you need to know all of that.
02:06:30 It's really, but, uh, yeah.
02:06:35 Yeah, I, I too was like at the, at the like very beginning of like the
02:06:41 project that is going to define my career for the next year.
02:06:44 And I'm like, gotta not work on that yet.
02:06:47 Let's go to Radcon.
02:06:48 But like,
02:06:48 it's been really frustrating.
02:06:49 Cause I'm just like, I want to keep going on that.
02:06:53 Right.
02:06:53 But you're, you've been talking about you and Munchie, uh, inspiring
02:06:56 each other to try to work here.
02:06:58 So yeah, no, I got those, those two files have just been open for
02:07:03 like the last two weeks.
02:07:04 Just like, are you sure?
02:07:06 Are you sure?
02:07:06 God, that feeling of having it open and like, or
02:07:10 especially if you have something for a project on a tab in your fucking
02:07:13 chrome and it's there for days or like a half finished movie and you're just
02:07:18 like, I'm never going to finish this movie.
02:07:21 It's the worst.
02:07:22 Yeah.
02:07:22 All right.
02:07:23 Well, uh, I think we're about done here cause I am sick of sitting in this
02:07:28 chair and I've run out of questions.
02:07:31 All right.
02:07:31 So that's the interview with Tom.
02:07:33 Hope you all enjoyed interviews are not like back.
02:07:37 There's only like two that need to be done.
02:07:39 It was you and mage, I think.
02:07:40 Yeah.
02:07:41 And now this one's knocked out.
02:07:42 So, uh, I hope you enjoyed it with video and look forward to more rad con
02:07:46 video because there's a thousand of them.
02:07:49 We've literally filmed like, like probably over 20 vlogs today or 20 pieces
02:07:54 of entertainment today.
02:07:55 Yeah, look forward to everything.
02:07:58 Peace.
