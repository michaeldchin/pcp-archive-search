00:00:00 Well boys, you're rich, you love, you're in love. Top it off, you got your own monkey.
00:00:15 Work of two guys from Jersey, possibly one. Well to have these fucks stop talking shit
00:00:20 about us on the internet for starters. What have I been telling you? There's not much
00:00:23 you can do to stop that. Well short of showing up at all their houses beating the shit out
00:00:27 of them I guess. You know with all the money we're making man we could buy a lot of plane
00:00:38 tickets.
00:00:39 Commenters please kill yourselves and free me from this living hell. If your comment is
00:00:45 mean and snythen you can just fuck off and die. Why do you feel entitled to spewing your
00:00:52 bullshit attitude? You're rude and crude and I hate you so kill yourselves please and
00:00:58 be cool. I pronounce the word wrong I don't care. I didn't represent you, yeah no shit
00:01:07 I am myself motherfucker. Think I got a bad attitude while you ain't seen shit. A shadow
00:01:15 band you're ass to deal with it. Hello everybody and welcome to yet another episode of the Pro
00:01:20 Crastinators podcast. I'm hosting today, I'm Digi Bro and we're doing a little sequel
00:01:25 to a topic we've done before. We did reviewer rules, now we're doing commenter rules and
00:01:30 I'm joined by my panel of co-hosts, starting left to right. We got Jesse Wood. Happy Easter
00:01:36 I'm gonna shit on everyone. Endless, endless Jess, not as Jesse Wood. Oh I'm gonna get
00:01:40 into that. Yeah that's gonna be important. Best guy ever? Hey sexy lady. The DeVoo?
00:01:55 www.hi.com. Hippocrit. Yep. And Tommy Oliver. I'm mad at comments. Yes, yeah. The recent
00:02:11 example of a toxic comment section. Toxic. This is a very appropriate time for us to
00:02:17 do this podcast. This is something that has been brewing within me for a long time. Let
00:02:21 me tell you guys, I've been like a caged animal waiting for this topic to come up. I have
00:02:27 so much to fucking say. The people have asked for it too. The commenters want to know how
00:02:31 to conduct themselves. They're just ignorant and they need education. If only it was that
00:02:36 cut and dry. Yeah when we did reviewer rules we sort of hinted at doing commenter rules
00:02:42 and I've had this video idea planned for a long time. I was gonna do like a top 10 video,
00:02:47 top 10 things to make me hate you in my comment section. I've been planning that forever. I
00:02:52 feel like you should still do that. Definitely. Yeah but I have multiple comment videos written
00:02:57 that I'm just sitting on waiting to unleash upon the world. I mean if you put the money
00:03:02 just gonna get the comments. Hopefully this opens the fucking. This just goes to show how
00:03:05 passionate we are about this topic. It had to be done on this podcast for a few reasons.
00:03:10 One cause Jesse always has problems with this commenters. He's been on like a fucking
00:03:16 crusade. I've developed a system. It's a three step system where if you even fucking piss
00:03:24 me off one time. Like I've been doing this for like six years. I've fucking had it.
00:03:30 So from now on, if you even slightly piss me off, the first thing I do is right away
00:03:37 you're banned. You can never fucking comment again. I don't give a shit what your excuse is. If you
00:03:42 say you were ignorant of the rules or if you didn't mean to offend me, fuck you, you're gone. And the
00:03:47 best part is it's a shadow ban. So you don't even fucking know your ban. You're just writing your
00:03:51 comments out and they go into a void. It's a Chinese ban. Yeah so step one is your ban. Step
00:03:57 two, I screencap your comment and I ridicule you publicly on Twitter so that everyone knows what a
00:04:02 piece of shit you are for all time. And the third step. It helps filter out more comments because
00:04:06 a lot of Twitter people will then be like, I think that guy has a decent point so that you can
00:04:09 ban him. Exactly. That's my plan. It'll help foster a better comment section in the future.
00:04:14 It's very clear right now. People who are going to say that you're violating your freedom of
00:04:17 speech, I have it right here. The first amendment. This is what it says. The first amendment is
00:04:22 don't piss me off. I'll fucking kill you. Don't say anything on my fucking shit. Don't say anything
00:04:28 on the internet. You wouldn't say it on my face. Jesse, what's step three? What's step three?
00:04:32 Is that since I have a screencap of your comment, it goes, it gets filed away in a
00:04:36 manila folder for future use in a fucking video where I will even more publicly fucking shame you
00:04:43 and make you, hopefully you'll be watching and make you kill yourself. That's my ultimate goal,
00:04:48 is to make my commenters. It kills themselves in shame. It's funny because we're kind of
00:04:53 slipped down the middle on our handling of comments. I don't respect their right to live as a human
00:04:56 being on this world. They are holding all of humanity back with their bullshit insipid comments
00:05:00 and their refusal to understand anything. They're getting ahead of ourselves. It's funny. I want to
00:05:06 murder them with a shotgun. I have murderous fantasies. I want to find them. I want to get on
00:05:11 a plane and go to all. It fucking bothers me. It keeps me up at night. It makes my skin crawl to
00:05:17 think that I can't fight my commenters. I want to get on a plane like Jay and Son of Bob strike back
00:05:22 and fly all over America and find them and one by one kick the crap out of their pubis fucking heads.
00:05:28 That should be the intro to this video. Actually, yeah, it should be because that scene is amazing.
00:05:34 It really is. I think that's probably the most, I think for an internet content creator, if you
00:05:38 haven't seen this, you can just watch Jesse did a video where he set that scene to the Kill La Kill
00:05:43 song. You can just go watch that. It's one of the most satisfying things I've ever seen. It is one
00:05:48 of my favorite scenes in any movie. It's literally Jay and Silent Bob get rich and with all the money
00:05:54 they have, they realize that they can fly around the U.S. and beat the shit out of people who leave
00:05:59 negative comments on their online content. I've gone through a period where I've had a big video
00:06:06 that gets lots of bad comments. What I was just thinking of is I can just mail them all a ticket
00:06:11 to this exotic trip on a bus and then drive the bus into a careen and kill all of them in one fell
00:06:16 swoop. That seems a lot easier to get away with because they'll just be seen as a coincidence.
00:06:21 The only problem is they're not all going to fit on one bus. There's just too many.
00:06:24 You know what? Maybe we're right to intro this way just so people can understand the level
00:06:30 of passion. Because we all have different ways of dealing with comments, but our hatred for bad
00:06:36 comments is universal and seething. That's true. I think we'll all agree on this one. I hate this.
00:06:40 I know that at least Digi agrees. I hate this stigma of against turning off the comment section.
00:06:48 The only reason I don't turn mine off is because there's a stigma against it.
00:06:51 I don't believe that comments should even be allowed anywhere at all. They shouldn't exist.
00:06:56 Well, Jesse, you keep getting ahead of me here, man. We're already six minutes in
00:07:00 and I haven't even properly introduced this topic. I told you when we were starting this
00:07:02 that I have a lot to say about this topic. I know we're going to get to that. We're going to get
00:07:07 to it. Just let me properly lead us in first. Okay, go for it. Because the part of the reason
00:07:12 for this is not just that Jesse has this ongoing crusade. It just so happens that
00:07:17 me and Tom have both recently have really bad comment sections. I made this video about a race
00:07:23 that got over 3,000 comments in 24 hours, which is way disproportional to the number of views
00:07:30 it has. It's like everyone who watched it fucking commented. I've had to ban more people based on
00:07:35 this video than I have based on any other video for the insipidness of the comments.
00:07:39 Even more than the sort of online? Well, with that one, I just turned off the whole comment
00:07:44 section. And I didn't really ban people back then as much as I do now. And then Tommy Oliver here
00:07:51 recently put out this pony video, which is funny because it was in response to comments he'd gotten
00:07:57 in the past. Tom, you want to explain this? What exactly this is? Yeah, I mean, for the past three
00:08:02 years, I made horse videos years ago. I don't even really do it anymore. To this day, I still get
00:08:07 comments like shitting on this one stupid idea that I had. And so they finally, after years of
00:08:13 persecution, the show basically up and says I was right. So I make this most like tongue in cheek
00:08:18 disgusting meme trash video just gloating because like I'm right and it felt great. So I put like
00:08:23 70 comments in the video that I'll just like try to shit on me over the course of like three years
00:08:28 and then just like blew it the fuck up. I've never so thoroughly seen one group of commenters get
00:08:33 absolutely ass blasted the fuck out like it was on that video. It was amazing. It was great. I
00:08:38 want you to go watch it. It was years in the making. But of course it just inspired like it's
00:08:42 because we took all this time. Me and Nate went back for them. We got to make sure this is airtight
00:08:46 and bulletproof and it doesn't matter. You know, stupidity knows no bounds. You can't expect them
00:08:51 to learn like people. They're not people. They're monkeys. They're animals. I mean, if you look,
00:08:56 if you have a conclusion and you're searching for evidence to find it like, okay, my point is
00:09:01 Tom's wrong. Got to find evidence. You'll always be able to find confirmation. Little minutia, huge
00:09:05 problem voted up. That's exactly what it is. Yeah. So, yeah, Jesse, to get back to it,
00:09:11 the point you were bringing up and I have like a 30 minute video about this on my Digibro After Dark
00:09:16 channel called On Closing Comments. We won't get into as much depth about it because you can just
00:09:21 go watch that video. But like, yeah, there is a huge weird stigma against closing comments that
00:09:27 makes no fucking sense. And the simplest way to explain why it doesn't make sense is that
00:09:34 no other art form has this. Yeah. When I go and see a movie in the theater,
00:09:39 they don't give you a pamphlet with a bunch of rotten tomatoes reviews inside of it when you go
00:09:43 see a movie. No. There's no, there's no other art form that has the comments, except for like,
00:09:50 like with a book, they will actually take good comments people have made about it and put it
00:09:55 in the book to hype up the book. That's the closest thing I could think of to this. But like,
00:10:00 people think that they're entitled to, like, and it's always censorship and freedom of speech is
00:10:06 what they always say. They always say, oh, it's censorship to delete comments. And it's like,
00:10:10 no, it's not because I am giving you this platform. I don't have to. There is no, like,
00:10:17 when people say it's censorship, it's like censorship would be if I told you that,
00:10:20 like, if I shut down your blog that was talking about my video. What is it? I'm kind of on the
00:10:25 other side of this argument because I see a comment section as a place where there is an
00:10:30 opportunity for discussion. And yes, some comment sections are completely cancer.
00:10:33 Yeah, but you, you allow that. Because that's right. I do.
00:10:36 YouTube has a button that you can press that says allow comments on this video or don't allow
00:10:41 comments on this video. If I want discussion on my video, I leave the, like 100% of the reason
00:10:47 there's comments on my videos is that I like reading comments because I have fostered a
00:10:52 comment section that actually has good discussions. Sometimes, sometimes it's shit, which is why,
00:10:59 like, the other day I made a video about positive videos I had done. It was like,
00:11:05 videos about anime I actually like. And the whole video is just me listing all the positive videos
00:11:10 I've done. And at the start of it, I made the horrible mistake of saying comments about my beard
00:11:15 will be deleted. Because every time I show my face on camera, I get a thousand comments about my
00:11:19 beard. And it's super annoying because there's nothing to do with the video. And I don't want
00:11:22 to hear about my fucking beard. So I said that and of course I got like an insane number of
00:11:28 comments about the beard and I was deleting them all. And then I realized that the other
00:11:33 comments weren't interesting because there was nothing to discuss in this video. It was just
00:11:36 a list of other videos. So I just disabled comments on the whole video and that made perfect sense
00:11:42 because there's no room for discussion. There's nothing to talk about on it. So like,
00:11:47 the comments section to me is really just your way of saying, hey, I want you guys to talk about
00:11:53 my video and I want to read it. In a perfect world, it would be a place for discussion,
00:11:59 but that's just not the reality of how it is because people are violent mutants and it's just
00:12:03 sewage. It's graffiti is what it is. It's not graffiti because in no way does it actually
00:12:08 impact the material itself. Because if somebody leaves a comment that completely misunderstands
00:12:16 my intent and they leave that fucking comment on there, other people see it and it affects how
00:12:20 people view my art. Okay, let's make a distinction between closing comments and deleting bad comments
00:12:26 that are purely tacky. It's just a fucking blight on my work, on my blood sweat and tear. I honestly
00:12:32 thank you guys for a little bit too sensitive about the criticisms you get. This is not just
00:12:36 about criticisms. How many times have you seen a comment that spoiled what was going to happen
00:12:41 in the video, that repeated the jokes from the video and therefore if you read, because a lot
00:12:45 of people, because of the fact that the comments are right there, a lot of people do end up scrolling
00:12:50 down and looking at the first few comments while they're watching the video and those first few
00:12:54 comments will almost always be some kind of spoiler, some kind of repeat of the joke that was in the
00:12:58 video. Are spoilers, are those really relevant though? Do those really cost you anything in the
00:13:02 video? I don't know if they do. How many videos are like ruined by spoilers on YouTube? There
00:13:07 could be a lot because if you ruin the punchline of a joke video, then the punchline is the same.
00:13:12 You don't know the meaning of the punchline, so there's nothing to spoil until you already get
00:13:16 to that point. You would be shocked by how often there are spoilers in the comments of YouTube
00:13:21 videos. The comments down there are part of the viewing experience. I could be watching someone's
00:13:27 video and like it, then I read a comment, it puts me in a bad mood, and so the commenters just spoiled
00:13:33 the good mood that the video put me in. Those dang commenters. Friends, then don't read the comments.
00:13:37 That's on YouTube. Just don't read the comments. It's very hard to not read comments there right
00:13:42 there. If the comments aren't supposed to be read, they should be elsewhere. This podcast is not
00:13:47 titled Let's Remove All Comments. It's called Comment to Rules because we want comments to be
00:13:51 good because that won't happen. And a part of that is the creator's ability to remove comments or
00:13:56 allow them. Given you were saying something, what are you saying? I was going to say I think a lot
00:14:00 of the people who comment like just incipid uninteresting stuff is because they use the
00:14:07 comment section like they would a Skype chat. Like they don't have anyone to talk to the video
00:14:12 about, so they feel like it's a community down there. That's true. They can look at it. I think
00:14:16 that's a valuable thing when I wouldn't really want to take it away from people. Well, Nate,
00:14:21 that's a thing though. It can be valuable and it can also be hurtful. It can actually make,
00:14:26 like okay, for something like- It could be. My Digi Bros show, right? My Digi Bros show,
00:14:31 the comment section is really good because it does feel like a community because it's a small
00:14:35 group of people watching it. It's the same people watching every video. So there's sort of a communication
00:14:41 between them and us. We read the comments and there's an ongoing conversation. And I like that
00:14:48 because it's an ongoing series of videos, because it's something that has a narrative to it and
00:14:55 that the commenters understand that narrative, and there really is nowhere else to talk about it,
00:14:59 nowhere else that makes sense to talk about it. But if you had, let's say PewDiePie, right?
00:15:06 There's a reason that he doesn't have comments enabled on his videos, partly because he gets
00:15:11 constant spam in there, but also because to foster that kind of community, he has his own
00:15:18 forum. There's a whole PewDiePie forum where people can actually discuss his videos who
00:15:22 all sort of know the context, who know all the things he's talking about, and aren't just random
00:15:27 people running in and yelling memes and being... Look, that's true. There's no place I've seen
00:15:31 that was more gross than the PewDiePie comment section, especially with spam. But I just wonder
00:15:36 if there's really any harm being done by filling the comment section with those when you just have
00:15:40 the ability to not look at it. You can just not scroll down because you're on a PewDiePie video
00:15:45 and you know that it's going to be... It's pretty good analogy for comment sections that I just thought
00:15:54 It's kind of like the YouTube video is like a party that's being thrown by the YouTuber
00:15:58 and all the people who come in like it's a free party and there's free food and stuff and they
00:16:03 come and they experience it and anything they say out loud within a shot of like the guy who's
00:16:09 hosting it is a comment and anything they say to their friends after they leave or anything is
00:16:13 like something they say amongst themselves or in their own Skype chats or somewhere else
00:16:18 where it doesn't hurt it's not annoying but if you if somebody just comes in and they you know
00:16:23 they try the punch and they don't like it and they say this party sucks really loud and there's
00:16:27 leave like that's a bad comment I hate that guy because you just first of all I don't feel like
00:16:33 it's a party I feel like like my videos are are are for me and my friends and to a much
00:16:40 lesser extent but still they're you know my patrons and that's it everyone else is an
00:16:44 uninvited guest in my house so you better fucking behave yourselves and if you don't
00:16:49 you're dead I will stick my dogs on you I don't begrudge anyone for closing their comments if they
00:16:54 want to you absolutely have the right to do that I'm just simply stating why I'm not interested
00:16:57 in doing that personally or I mean maybe I'll get a video uh that has a completely toxic comment
00:17:02 section you already have one what about your Final Fantasy 7 video those but that's the thing
00:17:06 that is that is definitely a toxic place where people don't fucking understand anything I mean
00:17:13 the half the people who watch it voted down they don't understand my points and it's it's simply
00:17:17 them you know being ignorant of the facts but even then even then I like to think that it is
00:17:22 it's something that could be witnessed by people who do get it they could be like wow
00:17:26 there's something to be learned from this kind of comment section you know right so first of all
00:17:30 everyone listening I'm not bad at interrupting I just rolled a bunch of bad
00:17:34 rolls a bunch of times in a row that's why I was so bad interrupting for seven minutes there
00:17:37 I'm a good interrupter second of all all right uh commenter rule number one wait let me interrupt
00:17:43 you real quick DeVoo uh I've got to say that I'm probably the best interrupter wait actually
00:17:47 did you just both of you did you just compare interrupting to like rolling a dnd type because
00:17:52 that's funny I like that that's a really good analogy I actually I don't know how I have to cut
00:17:57 off I have to cut off everybody because DeVoo I don't want you to say what your number one rule is
00:18:02 it could be rule number two because I already had planned what rule number one was yeah let's
00:18:06 get into the specific things so rule number two make friends on Skype and bitch about YouTube videos
00:18:13 there because we do that constantly we constantly make comments because we make videos and we know
00:18:17 how annoying they can be to read so we say a lot of shit in prayer even if you're just a big fan of
00:18:22 videos then you probably have a whole lot of bitchy thoughts you want to think about and something
00:18:26 makes you mad that's perfectly understandable so just hunt down people who watch the same kind of
00:18:30 videos complain with them and then everything is going good that's the natural order of things
00:18:36 let me tell you about a feature that I didn't appreciate back when I had it but now I really
00:18:40 miss it which is there used to be this thing called a google reader and it was an rss feed reader
00:18:46 where you'd have like you know all the basically any blog you follow you would plug its feed into
00:18:50 your google reader it's kind of like subscribing to something on youtube it would be a list of all
00:18:54 the blogs that you're following right and you could share like you could take something from that feed
00:18:59 and share it with your friends on google and then you could have your own comment section for that
00:19:04 post so let's say I posted something on my blog and then my blog has its own comment section where
00:19:10 people are responding to me but then if someone shared the thing on google reader then they could
00:19:15 just talk about it with their friends and it would give us the opportunity to speak more critically
00:19:19 about the post without having to say stuff right to the guy's face that maybe would be annoying or
00:19:25 you know or or beat defeat the point or derail the conversation so I think that that is definitely
00:19:30 something that should be done I think there's too many people who respond to your video with
00:19:35 comments that aren't helpful for you or for other viewers of the video they're just the guy I don't
00:19:40 know I think this whole I think this whole wall of separation you want to put up between the
00:19:43 person who made it and the people who are commenting on it I'm not sure that's a good thing that's not
00:19:48 that is not what I'm describing okay I'm describing having two places to discuss the video all right
00:19:53 one that you could like could you imagine if all of us took the shit that we say about like the
00:19:59 average like brony reviewer and we said all that in their comments it would be a nightmare it would
00:20:03 fucking ruin their life you know they would hate it they would fucking delete their channel and kill
00:20:07 themselves if they had us doing that because we have this chat we can openly criticize and discuss
00:20:14 people ah so you're saying there's a time and a place for certain comments and yeah I'm saying
00:20:18 that those comments would not be appropriate on the right I think the point is that being on the
00:20:23 internet and having a comment section isn't an excuse to ignore human decency yes like you should
00:20:31 as a proud fortune or I disagree for the same reasons that you wouldn't like like okay you know
00:20:36 I have all my friends right my my offline friends because we all talk together all the time I don't
00:20:42 think any of us really just like splits off into one-on-one groups and talks shit about each other
00:20:46 at least I don't as far as you know as far as you know but uh but like you know in real life I
00:20:52 talk to myself about how much I hate you all yeah you've got all your friends and you you split off
00:20:58 with one of them and you might talk shit about all the other friends yeah but it's not it's not
00:21:02 because you don't like them you just want to vent your feelings about them right and if you brought
00:21:07 those things up to that person they might be hurt or offended and it might you know put a damper on
00:21:12 your relationship in a way that you didn't intend to because you're just venting feelings that that
00:21:16 inside you can deal with because you want to be friends with that guy but you know maybe you
00:21:20 got to complain about that friendship and human decency is based on it's having respect for someone
00:21:25 to shit on them privately and you know the reason why that's part of human decency the YouTube sphere
00:21:32 is a place where you put ideas and then people shit on them because that's just the way they feel
00:21:38 like doing it but that's the thing I don't think it I don't think it makes sense to be that way
00:21:41 like like I said like I said there's no there's never a time like if we all watched Batman v
00:21:47 Superman yeah and we all thought it was a huge piece of shit no one walks up to Zach Snyder on
00:21:52 the street and goes your movie's a fucking piece of shit I might make internet videos we posted we
00:21:56 posted on our blogs for our audiences for us to discuss with our friends we don't go up to the
00:22:02 fucking guy and tell him he's a piece of shit but I mean isn't that possibly worse that you're
00:22:07 like creating you're you're sharing this opinion with all these people I mean they they probably
00:22:10 haven't formed an opinion yet I mean if you're doing that aren't you convincing these people to
00:22:14 maybe be that guy and to you know engage in that I'm convincing them to feel the way I feel but
00:22:20 not to confront Zach Snyder himself obviously yeah not to go up to the guy and tell him he's a bad
00:22:24 person because he made a movie I kind of I don't know like doesn't he need to hear that like dude
00:22:28 your movie fucking sucked do a better job not necessarily because he's just doing what he I
00:22:32 don't know how we don't know movies do we have to get before they hear some real criticism about
00:22:36 how fucked up I mean sure if I mean from the perspective of like business yeah like if if
00:22:43 the people who are paying him are listening to the commenters because they care about making good
00:22:47 movies then it's up to them to tell him hey we don't like what you're doing and we we're not
00:22:53 going to let you have this budget but Zach Snyder himself we don't know what his intentions are
00:22:57 maybe he doesn't give a fuck about making good movies he's just doing what he feels like doing
00:23:01 and that's completely fine that's not fine that's not fine that we have to be subjected to shit
00:23:05 art and then he's not no one's allowed to criticize under his face I mean it's not really his like
00:23:10 okay who's giving him the power to make Batman v Superman look we have to blame someone for the
00:23:14 result of a bad okay well also who are we to say that it's shit art in the first place it's true
00:23:20 I thought that I thought that Batman v Superman was laughably hilariously a fucking train wreck
00:23:26 like on the level of the room and I thought for sure that this would be the unanimous opinion
00:23:30 that everyone would agree with me that it was a fucking train wreck of a movie and then I talked
00:23:35 to a fucking gargag on Facebook and and he's like that was the best movie ever anyone who complains
00:23:41 about it is a nitpicking faggot so then I have to step back and go oh well maybe I am a nitpicking
00:23:46 faggot I don't fucking know shit okay we can't get into a whole discussion about the subjectivity
00:23:52 of art because that's a whole different thing once you come to a conclusion about something
00:23:55 well I'm back in the digits point like I wouldn't go up to Zach Snyder and say fuck you your movie
00:24:00 sucks right I had I had a comment on on my reddit the other day because I have my own reddit board
00:24:06 and people will often post my videos on there and like you know have more private discussions about
00:24:10 them like with me because I'm more likely to read and respond to longer comments on there and one
00:24:15 guy left a long comment about my erased video basically saying that it wasn't that helpful for
00:24:21 for like essentially he was saying that it didn't represent a broad opinion or it didn't represent
00:24:26 like you know his like how most people felt about the show and stuff like that why does that
00:24:29 simply already worth this point it needs to yeah exactly right but that's that's that's kind of what
00:24:34 I what I said in response is I was like I mean I get I completely understood his complaints and I was
00:24:39 just like this video is really for me though it's not really about like it's not like this was not
00:24:45 supposed to be helpful for everybody it was supposed to help for a very certain as I'm listening to
00:24:48 this conversation I'm trying to imagine what a commenter person listening to this podcast is
00:24:53 thinking and I'm thinking that they're thinking yo I wasn't trying to be insulting I didn't call
00:24:57 them a faggot I didn't call them any names all I did was point out some mistakes that they made
00:25:01 in their video and then they flipped on me because they were wrong overreacting so here's here's my
00:25:05 parameters right here are my three conditions for I I think you guys would agree but here are my
00:25:09 conditions for like a criticism in any capacity that I would respect or like versus ones I don't
00:25:15 first parameter is do you know what you're talking about do you really put in the thinking did you
00:25:20 put in the thought did you did you apply critical thinking right to okay are you are you do you have
00:25:26 tacked are you acting like a normal person are you not being an asshole parameter number three
00:25:32 is your criticism effort did was there much effort into it was it a piece of art was your
00:25:37 criticism a work of its own or was it just two sentences of a complaint because that's kind of
00:25:42 annoying I don't think there's anything wrong with a simple complaint that gets to the point okay you
00:25:46 don't need to have all three conditions right but okay because I think people are gonna say that
00:25:49 we're being hypocritical because of the fact let me try to boil that down a little bit because I
00:25:54 think what you're getting to the heart of here is people who say that uh that you can't take criticism
00:25:59 right right I gotta say it's the longer I hold on to my thoughts the more nervous I get for some
00:26:02 reason if I take too long to say my things I freak out and I expect did anybody miss me fuck down
00:26:08 hey give yeah you know like a comment like that video sucks I think a lot of people are gonna say
00:26:14 you're guys being hypocritical because you guys make criticisms like I don't think right here's
00:26:19 here's my here's my response to that all right because people say people say like you know you
00:26:24 can't take criticism when you when you delete their critical comments and I have to get to
00:26:28 the heart of what I think right that's an over simplification and what I think we are doing
00:26:32 because like like me and Jesse said we don't post these to the guys who make the stuff we're talking
00:26:37 about yeah we just post these opinions online which is our reactions to the things that we see
00:26:43 that are entirely about us like there's a reason my channel is called otaku gonzo journalism because
00:26:48 it's about me it's about my perspective I don't send my sao videos to reki kawahara and tell
00:26:54 him he's doing a bad job and the reason that I don't is because to me constructive criticism
00:27:02 has to be from the perspective of understanding what the artist was trying to do because it's not
00:27:08 constructive if you don't know what I was going for like that erased guy who was saying that his
00:27:13 problem with the video was that I didn't you know appeal to a broader audience and he was saying this
00:27:18 is a problem with your video and I'm like but that wasn't my goal with the video my goal was to appeal
00:27:22 to this specific type of person and to myself the fact that everybody got to see the video is just
00:27:28 because that's the platform by which it will reach the people it has to reach I don't know I can't
00:27:32 like go out and find each individual who felt a certain way about a race and just but that's just
00:27:38 something that you accept by using this medium of YouTube you know it's but the fact that that guy's
00:27:42 comment isn't his it's not a point he's making somewhere else he's making it directly to me
00:27:48 and just to tell me hey you did it wrong now hang on I think it's like well I didn't I didn't intend
00:27:54 to do what you think I intended I think he's making it that comment to the other viewers of the video
00:27:59 you know because he posted it on my reddit oh okay so it's like straight like I'm the only one who I
00:28:04 think you know I I realized that I feel this way wrong criticism is worse to me than just insulting
00:28:12 me for no reason because when you fucking lobby some criticism at my art that is fundamentally
00:28:20 based on a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of my intent and you throw that criticism out
00:28:25 there as though it's valid other people are going to see it and think that it's valid and they're
00:28:30 going to view my shit through that lens but but sometimes sometimes and it's gonna sound crazy
00:28:35 but sometimes they're right no they're fucking not no I know that because if it wasn't perfect I
00:28:43 wouldn't have fucking uploaded it I know what I'm fucking created and I know what my intent is and
00:28:47 they don't I'm endless Jess and you're not all of you are not all of you listening to this
00:28:52 fucking podcast please fucking kill yourselves I agree but I don't think that the creator should
00:28:58 be the end all be all sayer of what is correct what is wrong about the video I absolutely want people
00:29:03 to be able to judge that themselves well here's what if you have people misunderstanding your videos
00:29:08 is that a failing on the audience is that a failing on you people misunderstanding my video
00:29:15 fine but you know what pisses me off me calmly explaining what they misunderstood and ignoring
00:29:20 nice wording and then I either get no reply or they continue to double down on you know what I
00:29:24 would like I would like an oh okay I would like people to exercise just a little bit of humility
00:29:30 you know yeah well I would turn that right back maybe you're wrong about your point you know the
00:29:35 lack of humility when people are not just like wrong or like not just misinterpreting the video
00:29:41 or misinterpreting something you did but like stubbornly wrong like you respond to them they'll
00:29:46 say well this this is this video sucks and you suck because this reason this reason and then and
00:29:50 then you go well actually it yeah actually what I was trying to do was this and then they still stick
00:29:55 to it like no no no no no you're right because yeah because of what I guess and it's like I just told
00:30:00 you that wasn't my intent you little fucking slimy protozoa you don't deserve dude all right all right
00:30:07 I hear what you're saying let me read you something because okay I've got a there here's an example
00:30:10 of something right my on my on my first current login video I'm gonna contain this rain it has to
00:30:16 be let out I have to let it out on my first current login video right there's been this thread
00:30:21 going on for like since it came out which is like a fucking year now almost it's been like a year
00:30:27 and this one argument has been going on for like fucking the entire time brilliant just just the
00:30:33 other day I finally commented on it myself and was like guys this argument has been going back
00:30:37 and forth about how shit current login is or how not shit it is for like a fucking year it's time
00:30:43 to end it no one is budging let us end the conflict now and you know what happened they were both the
00:30:48 two people who were arguing were like you know what dude you're right let's just move on and I mean
00:30:52 now some other fucking idiots are commenting on or like they're like reviving the argument and these
00:30:56 guys are actually you couldn't just ban them both the first time it happened a year ago and you
00:31:00 wouldn't be dealing with it ever again but I'm see but these people grew you know these people
00:31:05 were able to learn that that's another that's another bannable offense actually now that you
00:31:09 bring it up people talking amongst themselves on my video that is very annoying when they do that
00:31:15 no you know I don't wanna get shit my video is about a place to fucking whiter outside and talk to
00:31:20 your buddies otherwise cancerous threats something finally good came of it these two people came to
00:31:24 understanding about each other and I think that's valuable you know you annoyed me for a while but
00:31:28 something I guess I mean to me I just think it's they realize they're sinking too much time into it
00:31:32 and they didn't learn anything they're gonna go right back to arguing with other people but see
00:31:36 they did it until I stepped in and told him what's up you know I think that was that kind of moment
00:31:40 that's something that I'm probably the only one has ever happened well then I'm a fucking grunt
00:31:45 that shows the value of comments I fucking broke new ground there you go 97 percent of the time
00:31:51 I don't want to guys shut up let's I'm over with my car god damn me too just we're gonna get so
00:31:57 many fucking comments about how we all talked over each other it's gonna be a oh that's another
00:32:01 way I'm glad you brought up that one because all you fucking maggots out there who listen to
00:32:07 podcasts and complain about people talking over each other have you ever fucking been in a situation
00:32:12 or spoken to other human beings have you ever been in a social fucking interaction situation
00:32:16 do you not understand of course you haven't because you're all fucking autists you don't
00:32:19 understand how friends fucking communicate with each other this is a podcast we're gonna
00:32:23 fucking talk over each other because we're friends having a conversation have you never
00:32:27 fucking had a Thanksgiving dinner with your family you stupid fucking swine also this is over
00:32:32 Skype and there's a delay so the talking over is significantly worse than it would be if you
00:32:36 all went there talking over each other I can't understand what's happening because you're
00:32:42 talking over each other why can't everyone just ring a little bell and wait their turns to say
00:32:46 what they might have said why can't everything be orderly what would you say I would kind of like
00:32:51 a little bell well tell him were you saying some more I mean I have a couple points I want to make
00:32:57 but I'll say one for when they're more appropriate the one that I want to kind of jump off of from
00:33:01 what you were talking about with your comment section is something that really kind of pisses me off
00:33:05 and yeah again I agree with everything's digi saying like I think everything he says is valid
00:33:10 like I think there's definitely like an etiquette you should probably be following but I also agree
00:33:14 with you because I've never banned any one of my comments I very rarely delete comments because
00:33:18 I just think like it's an open platform whatever like I can think you're wrong but I'm not going
00:33:22 to stop you but what I was going to say something that really pisses me off in my comment section
00:33:26 and just comment sections in general is when people use the YouTube comment section as their
00:33:31 YouTube channel like if you're going to make a huge long-winded big fucking counterargument
00:33:35 like that's the reason video responses exist you know every time like I thought those disappeared
00:33:40 well I mean oh you mean just make a video yeah which is real it still pisses me off that they
00:33:44 got rid of those me too but like how many times have you seen other other people like put the
00:33:50 script of a video in the comments yeah and it's just like yeah you're just trying to hijack this
00:33:57 like yeah I really wish they could make another video that's much easier to ignore make your own
00:34:00 channel and do it it's funny you should say that because I did I dumped basically an entire script
00:34:05 about one of uh Jeff's NHK videos and it was probably like one of the longest things I've
00:34:09 you're the problem just don't clearly I guess yeah and I I I brought this up in my video on
00:34:15 closing comments and and Nate I think that's excusable because you and Jeff are friends so
00:34:19 like right right so you can like it it's always different we've been having this argument for
00:34:24 like a week anyway so right and there's there's differences when you have context for it like
00:34:28 Jeff also left a huge comment on my erased video but I completely saw that coming because me and
00:34:32 Jeff have been debating erased for a long time right and it was relevant that poor misguided
00:34:37 our audiences that they've listened to us argue about erased so him leaving a comment on the
00:34:42 video is kind of continuing the narrative in a way that I actually appreciate but like I think that
00:34:48 with with what Tom was saying um like I raised this point in my closing comments video that
00:34:53 you all have platforms I have a youtube channel you can make a youtube channel I have a blog
00:34:59 you can make which is why the whole free speech argument is completely invalid and does not
00:35:04 exactly and and that's and people will say because I've had this argument before where
00:35:08 someone was like well are you saying that like because you're already a big youtuber so if you
00:35:13 say something then everybody's gonna hear it but if I want to respond to it then that means I have
00:35:17 to go make a whole youtube channel and I'm like yeah exactly the reason I get the reason I get to
00:35:24 have this platform is because I write in a way that other people understand and appreciate I have
00:35:30 opinions that people relate to these farmers who just go out one day and harvest like a million
00:35:34 acres of food what like did they earn that shit they didn't do shit they just woke up one day and
00:35:37 they did that it's not like they spent a fucking six months right that field sewing the field growing
00:35:42 the you know like here's the kind of bad here's the comments can be really bitchy comments and
00:35:46 criticize me I see their fucking putrid comments and it's just it's like I'm looking into a sea of
00:35:51 people and they've all got their fucking jaws hanging open because they want to dig in their
00:35:55 mouths here's really the thing that always gets to me is the fact that these comments don't have a
00:35:59 whole lot of effort they didn't put on put in a whole lot of critical thought because you know
00:36:03 comments are literature they're a very low form of literature but that's what they are literature
00:36:07 is art they're shit I expect you to put in I I expect you to put in some effort some creative
00:36:12 effort I'm glad you like that and here's the thing no matter how no matter how bitchy a comment is
00:36:18 or how uh how much it criticizes me how much I disagree with it how much you could even personally
00:36:22 insult me personal attacks are far less insulting to me than people trying to postulate that my video
00:36:29 is something different than this comment can be anything but if I think it's funny and cleverly
00:36:33 worded I'll let it pass and maybe even thumb it up yeah I will earn my respect oh no I don't have
00:36:38 to be off more than commenters thinking they're funny the vast majority of them sometimes they are
00:36:43 funny oh you shouldn't do this oh you shouldn't do that and they're just not clever it's just it's
00:36:49 just a big waste of my time and that's the thing that you know I want to leave it there's
00:36:53 there's one important point that I want to bring up in regards to that and it's just that I've made
00:36:56 I've made pretty much I've been defending the the usefulness of comments but there is a reality on
00:37:02 the other side of that argument that is there may in fact come a time uh uh uh solid a snake from
00:37:07 Metal Gear Solid 2 he knew what was up one day it is possible that the like any intelligent argument
00:37:14 will be just completely drowned out by the walls of idiocy and just piled on everyone is wrong
00:37:20 about everything and they drown out any kind of responsibility to ban people who say stupid
00:37:24 shit I think that may in fact come a time when that's that's the case and already it's not worth the
00:37:29 time probably like practically I have videos that have gotten like twice the number of comments
00:37:35 that your uh your girl like on no no your final fantasy video has and it's like you know it was
00:37:40 at that level at that point where it just gets too much for me and you know by the way the reason
00:37:45 why I'm so ethically okay with banning is because it saves them time too they're not banned from other
00:37:51 videos well I don't know that's not true because it doesn't save them time they're suffering and I'm
00:37:56 not that's what I like about it I don't think you need to just say this now you could ban every
00:38:01 single person who comments at all if you wanted that'd be totally I have no problem with that because
00:38:05 it's my dream my dream is to wake up one morning and look into my empty comment section and
00:38:10 see that I've banned everyone yeah one day you'll get that I consider it important because and I've
00:38:19 been writing about this for for years even before I was nearly as big as I am yeah that the the way
00:38:24 to get a good comment section is by curating it because people will put more effort into your
00:38:29 comments if a they know you read them yeah you sometimes respond to them and see they see that
00:38:35 the other comments are good I'm just I'm just a lez a fair idealist I guess I just think that if I
00:38:40 don't do anything and hope maybe maybe there's a chance more good things will come as a result
00:38:44 it's just you know it's just my philosophy I mean like if you look at PBS idea channels comments
00:38:49 like I don't I don't know if they delete or do anything like that but because everyone knows
00:38:54 that they have a whole comment response thing that they've always done people leave by far the
00:38:58 best comments on YouTube on PBS idea channel every comment will be some long like thought out
00:39:04 really intricate response to the video because everyone wants to get read on the next episode
00:39:09 comments thing it's a cool strategy you know even I've written some like some really detailed
00:39:13 comments on there and I've been read in a video and yeah you were just mentioned on a video of
00:39:17 theirs well that was for yeah for something else but yeah I you know I have tried to foster that
00:39:22 in my comment section the whole time it's been around I respond to like the most interesting
00:39:27 or intelligent comments or anything I have something to say in in response to I actually like
00:39:31 seeing conversations on my videos when they aren't arguments when people get into long
00:39:36 arguments that's when it's like all right just shut down the whole fucking thread but like
00:39:39 when people just discuss things that that can be really cool because it means that like
00:39:43 I've I've created you know dialogue between people and I like that that's why that's why I
00:39:49 don't just close comments on all my videos because again I like the comments but to me if I want to
00:39:54 keep my comments being good then I have to ban the people who are just spamming bullshit I have to
00:39:59 delete the comments that are that are just fucking stupid because if people scroll down to your
00:40:03 comment section and all they see is a bunch of dumb bullshit then you get stuff like with my
00:40:08 erased video where every fifth comment is someone talking about how shitty the comments are it's
00:40:13 like I can't believe how butthurt everyone is over erased oh half the people are saying it's
00:40:18 shit and the other half are defending it like it's amazing blah blah and like all these comments
00:40:22 about the comments and I'm like did you did you said you said pen ultimate when you actually meant
00:40:26 ultimate uh let me just leave a quick comment about that we haven't even we're 40 minutes into
00:40:31 this and we haven't even actually started laying down any specific things that we don't like we
00:40:36 should just spend venom well I'm going to go ahead I'm going to go ahead and say what my first rule
00:40:41 is because I wanted I wanted to say this at the very beginning of the podcast because people will
00:40:45 have already broken it yeah the first rule of good comments this is absolute never break this
00:40:52 do not publish a comment before you finish the fucking video that's a good one that's a good one
00:40:58 YouTube should make that feature a button you can press that'd be yeah that'd be good actually
00:41:05 here's here's how you do it guys if you have something to say about something that was said
00:41:10 at the very beginning of a video type it out and then don't hit publish yeah wait until the video's
00:41:16 over because there's a good chance that it's going to be addressed like for instance on my uh on
00:41:23 my video about anime getting lazy with its meta there was a lot of people who would comment things
00:41:27 like did you mix up Ava and Gundam on purpose and then they would come back like they would leave a
00:41:33 second comment like oh now I get it because the whole video was full I like what you're doing
00:41:38 is you're not only laying out a rule you're expressing how to do it correctly you're applying
00:41:42 that see pcb is teaching you people all you have to do is type and I do this all the time I'll watch
00:41:46 it like uh like on I think that was one of DeVu's videos where like I had responses to like six
00:41:51 different points did this happen DeVu did I have a video where I had like six different little
00:41:56 micro paragraphs because what I'll do is I'll respond to like I'll type out whatever my thought
00:42:01 is on what's actually no better example the tbap q&a oh yeah yeah I did this on the tbap q&a
00:42:06 they would answer a question I would type out like something if I had to say it in response and then I
00:42:11 just uh go down to the next line in the comment and I'd wait and then once the video was over I had
00:42:16 like six different points and I published it and they were all there nothing is worse than the guys
00:42:22 who who actually leave a comment after every single thing they have to respond to yeah I get some of
00:42:28 those on digi bros where there's this one kid who will like respond to like like eight times to
00:42:33 phrases that we said throughout the video and I'm like dude just type it all out in one comment
00:42:38 you can even edit you can edit comments yeah but like for fuck's sake wait till the video's over
00:42:45 we we might have addressed what your complaint was and if we haven't then you can fucking
00:42:50 leave a comment which can I can I move on to realize is that every time they every single time they
00:42:55 leave a pointless comment I get a notification for it and I have to go through that emotional
00:43:00 rollercoaster of saying maybe it'll be a decent comment maybe and I have to click on it and then
00:43:05 it comes up and it's like my fucking dog died all over again every single time that I say nothing
00:43:11 my advice is to turn off your notifications device yeah I've had the notifications disabled for like
00:43:18 but then how will I know who to ban because I go I read all my comments through the comments page in
00:43:23 my creator studio because that way I can read the whole comment I'm not interested in solutions I'm
00:43:28 interested in my commenters killing themselves and dying you know uh related to that uh do speaking
00:43:34 of of accountability uh another rule I don't know we're on two two or three or whatever here's an
00:43:39 important rule three always every commenter number three every commenter must enable replies this is
00:43:45 non-negotiable you must allow this issue lately have you guys even been seeing this I have I have
00:43:50 actually I haven't seen this in a while there's nothing more disgustingly cowardly than putting
00:43:55 well here's the thing Nate I don't think any of them know they're doing that yeah this is some stupid
00:43:59 google thing the problem is that with with the with the responses thing it's that if you have
00:44:04 something like you can mark in your youtube options like uh I can only be responded to if I'm in your
00:44:09 contacts and people will have that checked without realizing that it means no one can respond to their
00:44:14 comments I kind of disagree with that one because really I I really hate people responding to my
00:44:20 comments I hate getting replies to my comments and I've often considered turning off replies
00:44:24 on my comments I think what the real issue is and a little bitch and a little bitch I'm more like
00:44:30 a fucking hero Nate I'm a fucking hero in a badass because I don't have time to put up with it you
00:44:34 know what I don't want to hear their stupid bullshit because they're fucking wrong my problem is dumb
00:44:38 and gay and dumb and gay and dumb you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen there in my
00:44:42 fucking kitchen when they're shitting all over men replying to my shit I'll fucking take a fucking
00:44:47 spatula I'll shove it up their nose I'll go up their nose with a rubber hose and I'll spray their
00:44:53 fucking oh so you might hate them replying you mean like you can reply to them but they can't
00:44:58 reply to you but this is like replies in your comment section well I'm saying I'm saying I think
00:45:06 people the problem is not just only not having replies enabled the problem is particularly
00:45:13 when they ask you a question and then don't have yes okay that's what I was trying to do
00:45:18 it's when they when they ask the problem is that they don't seem to realize that they have
00:45:22 got that's a valuable offense right there I don't want that shit my shit with this I almost feel
00:45:27 I sometimes feel sorry for them because I can tell they don't know right and I have no way to
00:45:31 tell them because I can't respond like there's this dude if you listen to this dude I'll bring
00:45:38 this up on digi bros sometimes once I actually remember there's this dude named reddler red who
00:45:43 responds to a lot of digi bros episodes with like fairly well thought out comments
00:45:47 but he has replies disabled and he'll like ask questions or how long he's been doing this
00:45:53 for months guys and he thinks you don't love him digi he's gonna he's gonna actually commit
00:45:57 suicide he's never like asked about it he's never like responded like hey how come you
00:46:02 don't reply to my comments or something but it's like there's no way and I get a lot of those people
00:46:06 who like ask like questions sometimes questions that I really want to answer but I can't do anything
00:46:11 about it it's just like you're fucked I can't do anything you don't have replies enabled I have no
00:46:15 way to contact you to inform you of this information you know so like yeah please enable your fucking
00:46:22 responses if you didn't know that was a thing now you know make sure you have it enabled if no one's
00:46:27 ever responded to your comments and you're not sure why this is probably why um but yeah wouldn't
00:46:34 that be funny that there's like some really unlikable person who's like oh that must be why
00:46:38 they go when they see it's not true and that's the moment where they break and actually kill
00:46:42 themselves holy shit that's great I really hope we can see that in the news oh god there'll be a
00:46:49 picture of all of us this yeah you know and they thought they just had disabled their comments
00:46:56 but really nobody likes them oh no all right let's move on I got one I got I got a problem
00:47:04 okay here it unsolicited advice and this this this is a big one it happened on my
00:47:12 fuck updates video which the worst thing ever happened it went viral which means I got a
00:47:15 bunch of fucking normies commenting on it with their that's worse than that and it also happened
00:47:20 on a recent video that I made called just rambling we're like also this this is this goes hand in
00:47:26 hand with watching the whole video before you comment because a lot of my videos they tend to
00:47:32 not be what they appear to be and you don't see that until later so I got a lot of people commenting
00:47:38 without finishing it and giving me unsolicited advice because the first half of the video
00:47:42 is that I'm going on this really retarded rambly like wrong like I'm I'm totally wrong in a lot
00:47:49 of places in the rant I say stupid shit I'm like empirically wrong I get facts wrong I completely
00:47:55 missed the obvious solutions right in front of me and I admit that but that's the point I wouldn't
00:47:59 upload it if I wasn't aware of it so like the whole point of the that first part where I'm going
00:48:05 on this long-winded retarded rant is because it leads into the bigger point when I start walking
00:48:10 around outside my house and go on a little adventure and people don't get that they just
00:48:14 assume that I'm some run-of-the-mill douchebag swivel chair reviewer you know sending out a video
00:48:19 to my audience please help me with this problem I need your genius advice and they don't check to
00:48:23 see if anyone else has left the other the same comments they're leaving that's another thing
00:48:26 you should oh that's a big one so it's millions they're all the same fucking comment well if you
00:48:34 can't find it you should try this website you should download this media player and it's like
00:48:37 motherfucker if you are watching the video it's safe to say I've solved the fucking problem already
00:48:44 or else you wouldn't be watching the fucking video because it wouldn't exist you idiots this is what
00:48:48 youtube needs have you ever gone to like a help desk or a forum before and you start typing in a
00:48:53 question and all the related things come up it's like is this what you want is this the question
00:48:57 you're looking for youtube needs that my audience they can't seem to just accept that I am smarter
00:49:06 than you okay if you think that you have some advice or some solution I guarantee you that I've
00:49:19 already thought of it and already done it or addressed it in the very video that you're
00:49:23 watching if you will fucking finish the video before you comment okay you don't need to give me
00:49:26 advice I don't want your advice I'm not asking for your advice I'm asking for you to sit down
00:49:31 shut your fucking mouth and let me do my thing like the genius that I am you fucking peons you
00:49:37 just leave comments open because you want the praise because it's everything you're saying so far
00:49:42 just sounds like you know fuck all comments yes I okay I would love to live in a world we're good
00:49:48 comments that are thoughtful and like you know they have that are relevant and and like well
00:49:53 written and spelled correctly and articulate I would love for that you know what I call those
00:49:58 commenters who leave good comments I call them angels because they don't fucking exist I would
00:50:02 love to remember that time shortly after horseshoe finale came out when all those great comments
00:50:07 were appearing all those crazy theories about the video yes that was awesome that was the best
00:50:12 thing ever and but but but it's just it's drowned out it's totally like it's a drop in the pond
00:50:18 compared to all this should have blown it all up because that information got drowned out he was
00:50:23 right he was right he needs to kill right and solidus is always right he was the hero the patriots
00:50:27 are evil those fucking you know the the the once in a in a great fucking eon when someone writes a
00:50:33 comment that that means something like you inspired me or something or like or like actually picked
00:50:39 something up in the video that actually was my intention and actually theorizes and gets it
00:50:43 right for a change those guys are fucking they're you're all heroes to me if you've ever left a
00:50:48 good comment you deserve a badge of honor you deserve to be you there should be a statue built
00:50:53 for good commenters there should be a hall of fame and but but there's so few in fact actually
00:50:58 but those are the people who keep me coming back those are the reason I don't right that I don't
00:51:02 turn off my entire comment section and I wish to comment or hall of fame I've thought about doing
00:51:06 something like that because uh my my friend ghost lightning he used to have this blog called
00:51:11 ghosts of discussions where like it was just straight up a blog where he would take the best
00:51:16 comments from his posts and he would post them on this other blog and like uh it was really
00:51:24 interesting just because it's like he can save and he he was the one who taught me how to like
00:51:27 make a discussion go well because he would respond to every comment he got like no matter how vapid
00:51:32 he would respond to it and therefore he would get these like long intense discussions in his uh
00:51:38 in his um blog posts and so I've always thought about every time I read a comment that's actually
00:51:43 like so good that I want it to be around forever I'm like I really should just open up like a
00:51:49 some kind of site the only problem is it would take effort and I have to go through all my videos
00:51:52 and find all those good comments but like yeah man a good comment like a really good comment
00:51:58 if I've ever hit like on your comment it means you're doing god's work you should just start
00:52:02 doing that now going forward and make a video saying you're doing it and then instantly everyone
00:52:07 will like start shaping up because they want to get on that not a bad idea you know what are the
00:52:10 really good comments they're really good comments that really mean something is patrons and fan art
00:52:18 you know those are the only those are the best comments absolutely yeah uh divus rule number
00:52:25 four I was gonna bring up myself read the other comments especially if what you have is a correction
00:52:32 if you look if you're just having like a raw emotional reaction to the video it's understandable
00:52:38 that other people might feel the same way right like maybe your thoughts are well I agree with you
00:52:43 on this point and I think it's but I feel this way about this thing maybe someone else has already
00:52:48 said that but you you also feel that way that can be valid but if if it's like uh you said uh
00:52:55 I did this to did you just the other day you said 2005 but it was actually 2004 and then like you
00:53:01 don't like you should assume that someone made that comment immediately because when I put out a video
00:53:08 I get about and by the way going back to the fucking finish the video before you comment
00:53:14 I know if you haven't finished the video if you comment before it's been long enough yeah
00:53:19 for you to finish the video I get I'll post a video that's 20 minutes long and it'll have
00:53:24 fucking 20 comments on it by the time 20 minutes have passed and I'm like I should just every time
00:53:30 I think about deleting them all I always consider like I know you haven't finished it so I should
00:53:34 just delete all of these well they skip to the ending you know they skip to the important part
00:53:37 you know that's all the matter you should just disable comments on every video for the length
00:53:41 of the runtime and then open them up hey you know not a bad idea yeah this has been a problem on
00:53:45 YouTube ever since Steve Wozniak first invented YouTube in 2009 back when he was only available
00:53:51 on the linux os Steve Wozniak sounds like the name of a man who gargles balls from it that's
00:53:58 exactly what that's my comment Tom uh the only problem with that is that you'd have to reload
00:54:03 the page to know that comments were enabled afterwards and I don't think a lot of people
00:54:07 would assume that but uh yeah I think I think uh what was I saying right within like minutes
00:54:15 of my video going up everything I've gotten wrong will usually be corrected yeah like if I pronounced
00:54:20 something wrong I'm gonna hear about it immediately and here's the thing I don't care that I pronounce
00:54:26 something wrong it does not matter yeah you have to understand you have to understand reading a
00:54:31 script is hard you'll notice that all those accurate youtubers who pronounce everything right
00:54:35 talk like this hey everyone because you guys are completely wrong on this one
00:54:43 pronouncing things wrong is the greatest sin that any human being can commit
00:54:58 listen if you have ever left a comment criticizing someone's pronunciation
00:55:02 fucking kill yourself kill yourself Jesse kill yourself you deserve to die
00:55:17 hey all right Jesse hang on if I make a mistake editing and I know I made a mistake oh
00:55:21 shit I made a mistake but I uploaded it anyway am I immune from criticism no I'm I fucked up
00:55:26 well I don't I don't want your fucking criticism I don't care
00:55:35 world where you're going around making mistakes all the time like some rank amateur maybe you can
00:55:39 get corrected but I don't make mistakes I actually pronounce amateur the fuck up I pronounce everything
00:55:45 correctly all the time and no one can ever correct me because I'm the correct guy get out of here
00:55:52 I mean yeah Jesse if you correct my pronunciation please kill yourself yeah I do not I don't
00:55:59 care I don't fucking care there's nothing I care about less if you under listen if you correct my
00:56:05 pronunciation that means you understood the word well enough that you knew what the correct word
00:56:11 was therefore I've communicated my fucking point you fucked it up it's a mistake it's not a fuck
00:56:17 if you understand what the word is annoying when I when I'm the only purpose of words is to
00:56:23 communicate ideas if you understand the ideas and the word has been communicated there is no
00:56:29 necessity to pronounce it a certain way it is fucking irrelevant I want to hear more about the
00:56:34 communication to deliberately throw some shit out there like cacophony and it just throws the flow
00:56:39 of the whole video off that's right Jesse's right right out of it it picks me up look it breaks
00:56:45 we argued about this the other day I agree that if he's the way he said cacophony if it's
00:56:51 distracting and it makes the video worse for you that's a valid feeling but to say you pronounced
00:56:57 it wrong is completely irrelevant you should pronounce your pronunciation has made this video
00:57:03 worse for me that's why your video your visual audio medium they're not judging it on based on I
00:57:09 don't want them to judge it I don't care about their judgments it's a piece of pro i don't want
00:57:14 to listen to their complaints about my art youtube is the only place that you can release the kind
00:57:23 of art that we're making and we have to make the platform better that's the point of this whole
00:57:29 podcast if you're saying somebody's name in a video you should have the respect for them to
00:57:34 pronounce it correctly the way god and nature intended and if you're saying the name of like
00:57:39 like like like a word from a foreign language like a japanese word you better fucking pull your
00:57:43 eyes slanted and fucking say it like they do and fucking show a bunch of stupid I don't want to hear
00:57:48 this from the guy who makes entire videos about pronouncing everything japanese wrong and that's
00:57:54 the joke of the video everything correctly when I say that fucking sega genesis attack on Gundam
00:58:00 is my favorite anime of all time where's the respect there you fucking piece of shit
00:58:07 even though it was just said I wasn't even I didn't even hear what you just said
00:58:11 I said attack on Gundam is my favorite anime where's the respect there what are you talking about
00:58:17 animal is hilarious yeah it's yeah that doesn't mean it's respectable you're wrong on purpose
00:58:23 because it's funny that's a whole lot different than being totally serious and accidentally being
00:58:27 an idiot with the way I grasping it straws digi jesse I think this is as you have it there is never
00:58:32 a time when correcting pronunciation in the comments makes you not a piece of shit
00:58:39 I will fucking die on this hill there is no there is no context in which correcting my pronunciation
00:58:45 will make me feel like you haven't become a worse person in my eyes there is no context you're too
00:58:50 sensitive man you gotta you gotta accept that you just make what is sensitive about that mistakes
00:58:55 and you need to be corrected I know I made mistakes I don't care I don't care you are shit
00:59:02 for complaining about it babe your video is objectively worse because you made a mistake
00:59:06 now correct me there's no such thing as objectivity that's not a thing now listen I don't
00:59:11 what you guys don't realize is at least in earlier digi videos a lot of his mispronunciations were
00:59:16 not like things that he was unaware of it's because I have a similar problem right I'm not as I'm not
00:59:21 as vocally talented as jesse is who can just amazingly put out amazing vocal performances
00:59:27 it's really hard how dare you leave a comment on my vocal performances how dare you say anything
00:59:31 about anything I've done ever I'll kill you listen I spent I just came out with a video
00:59:36 that would have come out two days earlier if not for the fact that I have to get up behind the microphone
00:59:41 I can get out maybe five minutes of a good performance then I gotta go eat work out go to
00:59:45 the bathroom it takes me hours to psych myself up and oh my god we've got a badass over here
00:59:50 because I'm talking a bit too fast or a bit too slow maybe you know my tongue will slip
00:59:54 or it's just so hard to focus that's the job that's the job if you can't do it go be a writer
00:59:59 that's not the fucking job that's that's fucking retarded my job is not to pronounce shit right
01:00:05 listen agonize over making sure that every single people aren't the same guy
01:00:09 I know you're correct I spend my hours on this day
01:00:13 I don't believe for I don't believe that there's any difference between saying
01:00:25 you pronounce that word wrong and saying you wrote your review wrong there's no difference
01:00:30 you don't know what my intent was look my intention was not necessarily to pronounce everything right
01:00:36 because I don't give a fuck about pronouncing everything right that doesn't make my video
01:00:40 those are those having a wrong script is one error pronouncing a word wrong in the script is
01:00:45 another error it's not it's not a fucking error because I am not necessarily trying to write
01:00:52 something that's going to pull people out of the list you think I want my videos to be in English
01:00:56 what makes you think that the goal of my videos is to even be in English you don't know that
01:01:02 it might sound a lot my video might sound a lot like English but that doesn't mean that that's what
01:01:07 my goal is did you hear you're lost you're in the woods now I can't listen to me let me break this
01:01:12 down let me break this down for you all right I like the way the word niche sounds I don't like
01:01:18 the way the word I don't like the way the word niche sounds I like the way the word niche sounds
01:01:23 so when I read my script your opinion on what is correct is not relevant right yes it is Nate
01:01:28 because I get to decide what I think is better aesthetically in my video you do not get to
01:01:34 if you think that niche sounds better all right you can go fucking die because that's not the point
01:01:39 of my video it's not to appease what you want me to sound like you say it's not the point but the
01:01:43 point of every video you make is to communicate ideas like your bill I did communicate the idea
01:01:49 you knew what I meant retard who the heck did decide the way you pronounce things Nate it's in the
01:01:53 god damn you can look it up online how to pronounce these words it's not exactly 10 different
01:01:58 results god damn it shut up if you look at pronunciation online every single pronunciation
01:02:03 is different it's a god damn language we have ways of pronouncing things that's a load of shit
01:02:10 everyone knows the first rule of language is that it's flexible if you talk to anyone who studies
01:02:14 language they'll talk about how the second language the word change is fucking stupid
01:02:19 and weird then you say it a better way listen I want if if my goal is for everyone in the
01:02:26 world to start saying niche that I'm gonna keep saying niche so that I can eventually turn everyone
01:02:31 into saying words the way I want them to be said I am a pundit for my ideas pinch shunt because I
01:02:36 think pinch shunt sounds way it sounds cooler nobody gives a shit how do you think it sounds cooler
01:02:41 it's not about what sounds cooler can I just say the the whole the whole crux of this argument is
01:02:47 you're making an error who cares though I don't think does that make your point less
01:02:53 I don't I care that I agree I agree with you that a who does who cares but I also don't think
01:03:00 it's something really weird but I still understand that I'm not gonna say well I don't really like
01:03:06 them or that video there's a very simple point there's a very simple point you made about this
01:03:09 and it's the fact that every single one of us who watched that bunny hop video when he said
01:03:13 cacophony we were like what what the fuck was that cacophony we all did it take when he said
01:03:18 cacophony it actively made the video that's pretty cool that's right it was a distraction
01:03:23 and that was exactly counter to what I didn't mind to make well I mean I minded it in the sense
01:03:28 that you mind it because you're insane the only thing I remember from the video that's right
01:03:32 exactly exactly that's the problem I remember everything from the video and it didn't bother
01:03:36 me slightly because I'm not a piece of shit I don't remember anything I don't I don't give a fuck
01:03:39 about cacophony I don't like it you're all shit I don't agree you are the worst commenters I hope
01:03:47 you die no fuck you and fuck anyone who pronounces words grievously wrong okay you know what there
01:03:52 are some words there are some words that I'll go either way on okay I don't have an opinion on
01:03:56 niche or niche it can it sounds it sounds fine either way but there are some fucking words
01:04:01 that just sound retarded when people say them wrong like cacophony I'm gonna have to agree with
01:04:06 that listen Jesse I agree that cacophony sounds stupid and cacophony sounds better and cacophony
01:04:11 is one of my favorite words I'd love it if more people said it and said it correctly but leaving
01:04:16 a comment on bunny hops video is the same as leaving any other shitty comment if you want to
01:04:22 talk about why everyone's why he's wrong make your own video about how to pronounce cacophony
01:04:39 if your problem with how he says cacophony is that you think it should be pronounced different
01:04:44 that's not his problem it's your problem it's the standard of the language the standard of the
01:04:49 language is always being changed they update the dictionary they update pronunciations you know
01:04:55 I had a I made a video Nate I made a video once the first video I ever got really shat on for
01:05:01 pronunciation was when I said feminity instead of femininity that was too much all right I'm not
01:05:06 with you look you say that but feminity used to be a fucking word that used to be how it was said
01:05:12 I looked it up I did the research feminity was originally the word femininity became the word
01:05:17 because people liked the way it sounded more which means the language it means nothing but
01:05:22 bullshitting what they like feminity sounds retarded whether it's whether it's technically
01:05:27 correct or technically not correct it sounds dumb so we changed it my point is that there is no
01:05:35 objective idea of what it means because it changes based on people's tastes meaning that when you
01:05:41 leave a comment that someone's pronouncing something wrong that's just your taste that's just your
01:05:45 opinion it's not objective there is no objective failure because objectivity isn't real right there
01:05:51 because the way the objectivity is is incorrect because what is objective is that we do have
01:05:58 a standard in the language that we have most of us it's it's a democratic process and we have decided
01:06:03 that we are going to pronounce as an english language cacophony not cacophony my videos
01:06:08 are not a democratic process my videos are things that i post to share my at this point at this point
01:06:15 i'd like to reiterate that this is not an argument about whether it's an objective fact that when
01:06:20 people pronounce things differently than how everyone else pronounces it it sounds weird
01:06:24 and it throws people off that's an it does sound weird i'd just i'd like to say that you just don't
01:06:29 have a big enough of a viewer base nor do i for there to be a large contingent of people it would
01:06:34 never happen to me because i pronounce everything correctly all of them just think that until until
01:06:39 you get enough people with different opinions no see that's just that's just that's just the wrong
01:06:42 way of looking at it jesse that's just hiding when you say that you say that you know you said it
01:06:46 sounds weird and wrong and that's kind of like when people go to your videos and they say the way
01:06:52 that you present your ideas is weird and wrong to me it's it's no that's totally different there is
01:06:57 no standard for how jesse should make his videos there should be no standard for language just like
01:07:02 there should be no standard for art did you i have a really important question where did you write that
01:07:10 shut up did you shut up shut up shut up no he said there should be no standard and that's
01:07:17 let the man speak i just want to say that i don't mind the whole mispronouncing things
01:07:27 as much as nate seems to because honestly i don't even hate it that much i don't even care what you
01:07:32 seem to i don't really give a shit okay i'm sorry go on go on i just the reason i don't mind it so
01:07:40 much is because i grew up in a place where loads of people had loads of different accents and i'm
01:07:44 just like if i hear cacophony or cacophony or whatever i'm just like oh and then i just
01:07:49 nobody knows what we're talking about by the way nobody has seen the super funny
01:07:52 what i was trying to say is that we gotta link it in the description yeah did you i want to ask you
01:07:57 the whole this discussion is pointless because all we're talking about is how much nate and or you
01:08:03 know how much any any of us cares about mispronunciations it's got nothing to do with comments let's
01:08:09 drop this whole subject who's super willing to accept people pronouncing words any way they want
01:08:13 the reason it bothers me so much is that i listen to the all kinds of reason that you're so
01:08:18 sensitive because you pronounce shit wrong all the time you know that's i listen to all kinds of
01:08:22 videos with people with weird accents who pronounce everything differently from how i'm used to and
01:08:28 i just assume well he comes from a different culture he has a different accent than me he
01:08:33 pronounces things differently where is george weedman that's how that's how i feel and people
01:08:39 because of the fact that most of the words i say sound like standard american english they
01:08:45 assume i don't have an accent but i have an accent it's just that only certain elements of the things
01:08:51 i say sound different it's only when i start saying shit like y'all which i say all the time
01:08:56 that people start realizing oh he's from the south and he says things in a different way and there's
01:09:02 words that i've learned in a way that's different from how other people have learned them and when
01:09:07 i use those words people complain at me because they don't think of it as he has an accent they
01:09:13 think of it as he's just saying words wrong i know the context just like all the other problems
01:09:19 did you have a question no no you're oversimplifying and that's wrong comments did these pronunciation
01:09:23 comments bother you this much when they first started happening here and there because i feel like
01:09:28 always bothered me there you go your point is invalid i have always been bothered by pronunciation
01:09:33 comments because of the fact simply as i said earlier with accent though you don't have a southern
01:09:38 accent it's not your act if someone is speaking in an accent and they're pronouncing words differently
01:09:43 i can interpret that in my brain and i don't get because you only think but that only doesn't
01:09:48 weird you out because it sounds so much like a clear accent what i'm saying is that i have an
01:09:53 accent it just sounds a lot like normal english but that doesn't mean it's not an accent there's
01:09:59 certain words that just i just say differently i don't hear that do you hear that hippo normal
01:10:05 english look is there a difference is there a difference between an accent and saying something
01:10:10 wrong definitely is there even a difference i would say yes i think i would say yes i think that
01:10:15 there are times when you when like there are some words there's a spectrum though there are some
01:10:20 words that i have said wrong because i've never heard them spoken before and i've only i've only
01:10:25 read them online and i've never heard them spoken so i say it and i pronounce it wrong and sometimes
01:10:30 someone corrects me on it and i i look it up and i go okay that makes sense i'll pronounce it that
01:10:36 way from now i pronounce the word bosom for like 10 years so there's a lot of words that are like
01:10:42 that there is other words that i that i pronounce wrong because i've said it for so long that that's
01:10:48 just how i say it like for instance i cannot pronounce bakemonogatari i cannot do it that sounds
01:10:55 fine no it's not like it should be well i actually did get closer to how i usually um closer than i
01:11:01 usually do but it should be bakemonogatari right dude you're not japanese it's forgiven but i you
01:11:07 have an american accent i always say bakemonogatari that's literally perfect that's literally perfect
01:11:12 what's wrong no it's not there's an e instead of an a at the end i've gotten complaints about it all
01:11:15 the time that i say bakemonogatari wrong because i say that e at the end instead of an a and it's
01:11:21 because i cannot in the in the context of reading a script i cannot say it the other way because
01:11:27 i've been saying it for like eight years okay well bakemonogatari because it sounds natural
01:11:32 literally a problem with you i can't when i try to read a script and i try to say niche it sounds
01:11:37 so fucking weird because i have to stop everything and over pronounce that word i did it in a video
01:11:42 recently where i was like it's feeling a certain niche you have to have some video some audio fidelity
01:11:47 you have to fucking accept that that it sounds wrong if you say it that way though did you just
01:11:52 motors through his scripts and doesn't pay any heed to them i think they sound better that way
01:11:57 i think when you over pronounce words and you talk slow you sound like a fucking nerd and i don't
01:12:02 want to listen to you i want to listen to people who sound natural who sound like using the voice
01:12:06 that they use in their everyday life criticizing the things that you've admitted are objectively
01:12:10 wrong just aren't allowed to say anything i'm saying that they that i'm saying that they're
01:12:14 missing the point of the video they're missing that the reason i talked the way i feel is because
01:12:18 i want the scripts to sound fast and if you had your way george bush would still be in office
01:12:24 and we'd all be pronouncing strategy as strategic that's the world if i had my way did you if i had
01:12:30 my way then then miss miss underestimating would definitely be a word all right i detected the
01:12:37 problem i've detected that's that's the george bush word and it is that you think that these
01:12:41 comments are somehow taking away from the other conversation of the video i don't see why that
01:12:46 has to be the case i don't think that they do i think they do look and here's the other problem
01:12:50 is that they can they can also be the death of of jokes and inside jokes i for instance i could
01:12:56 never get away with saying simultaneously in my videos because people would go what the fuck
01:13:01 are you talking about but to all of us that's hilarious because the time cube guy says simultaneously
01:13:07 so like i would love to write that into a script but what am i going to get a hundred million
01:13:11 comments going do you pronounce it wrong like and like maybe maybe cacophony was intended to sound
01:13:18 weird in that video we don't know that we do really don't we don't know you can infer based on tone
01:13:23 you can infer you can infer but that doesn't mean you know how many times have you been
01:13:29 farcical on purpose and people don't get it yeah but you don't look it's not his job to make something
01:13:35 that you will completely appreciate and understand it's his job to make his art if you leave a comment
01:13:40 saying that you weren't understandable that's no different from that comment that guy left on my
01:13:44 erased video saying this wasn't helpful to everybody my goal wasn't to be helpful to everybody
01:13:48 now if if i said if i came out and i said hey guys where are the mistakes in this video that
01:13:54 made it harder to understand then you commented that that would be great if i if i actually came
01:13:59 out and said hey where did i pronounce things wrong tell me i want to know i want to correct
01:14:03 myself and make my videos more understandable to more people then yes please you are constantly
01:14:08 asking that question by releasing a video that contains your speech i do not think so i think
01:14:12 that's bullshit i think it's pretty funny that uh that a podcast about like shitty comments has
01:14:18 essentially turned into a toxic comment section with all of us yelling this is the most intense
01:14:23 debate we've had yet on pcp i feel i just like to say that all of you since you're american are
01:14:29 always sounding wrong to me because i am english right yeah so he just said always no one ever
01:14:34 complains that he says always instead of always yeah and that seems it seems natural to you because
01:14:41 all the words he says sound are we even disagreeing anymore i think we pretty much i hope not all
01:14:47 right can we just move on what's the next thing that you shouldn't do in your comments we can
01:14:50 take away from that because i don't don't complain about pronunciation no complain all you want
01:14:55 back no the rule is don't work and if you do complain about pronunciation control f the
01:15:00 fucking thread so i don't have to read okay literally 700 we can all agree we can all agree
01:15:05 one is enough when it comes to that we can all agree on oh and and here's another thing about
01:15:09 the pronunciation thing it's one thing to correct the pronunciation but when i get comments like
01:15:14 the way he says kilua makes me want to fucking stab my ears out well get over yourself you fucking
01:15:20 piece of shit like like like me pronouncing a word wrong has like somehow given you cancer
01:15:26 that's the exact comment that i left on super bunny ops video i said the way you're pronounced
01:15:30 to cough and he gave me an aneurysm i mean that's just a that's a comedic thing it's just like
01:15:37 like the way you said it is kind of funny there are people who have left comments like they were
01:15:41 legitimately offended by the way that i pronounced kilua in my video dude i don't i clearly we're
01:15:48 coming to this from different angles because because i have committed federal crimes yeah
01:15:51 once you're all once you all get the level of comments i fucking get i want you to come back
01:15:55 and have this conversation all right when you've got a video with 700 comments insulting your
01:16:00 pronunciation and come back and tell me i'm just saying i'm defending ideas here i don't even think
01:16:05 the way i mean how lucky are you that you said it's gurren laggin time and no one said anything
01:16:10 about it lag on i said gurren no you said you say at the beginning of the video you say
01:16:14 it's gurren laggin time i did not say it i did not say it's gurren lagoon i totally remember it
01:16:21 being wrong i remember you should have called it gurren lagoon it would have been way funnier
01:16:25 do the whole video over i want to go live in gurren lagoon that's gonna be my japanese anime
01:16:32 all right let's move on let's move on what's the next rule it should be gurren lagoon
01:16:37 why'd you edit that down what who's got a rule let me compose myself Jesus Christ yeah i had to
01:16:43 take a second that was an epic debate hippo hippo say something while i try to think about my next
01:16:49 okay okay i got one okay oh i've got a good one though my blood is like no give it has rule
01:16:55 give it has rule i got a rule i got a rule okay don't ever don't ever post a comment for the
01:17:02 express purpose of getting plus ones because it's just completely pointless and it's so obvious i have
01:17:09 the strength to comment on this video anyway i think i think i mean stuff like i think hippo
01:17:14 means stuff like uh am i the only one who thinks this show is good yeah here's a rule here's a rule
01:17:20 never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
01:17:25 start a comment with am i the only one who don't do it i'll fucking murder your whole family that's
01:17:31 a bannable offense that's the worst possible comment you could ever make no you're not the only one
01:17:37 everyone is fucking thinking the same thing you're not special you don't matter you're gonna die one
01:17:42 day and i hope it's today fuck you you know i think that's all that needs to be said about that
01:17:49 plundering
01:17:53 given you should be leading this debate short sweet until the given gets it right there i can't
01:17:58 wait to see the commenters on this video like tripping over themselves to do it right ironically
01:18:02 say that oh yeah that's another one that's another bannable offense when i'm when i say in a video
01:18:06 don't make this particular comment and then they make that exact comment to be cute you're not being
01:18:11 cute you're not being funny you're not clever oh my god aids and cancer at the same time that's a
01:18:16 once again cuteness doesn't solve any problem it cuteness does not excuse anything it never
01:18:22 solved anything the way never when i said don't i when i said comments about the beard will be
01:18:27 deleted i really regret that i didn't say they that you will be banned yeah these people would
01:18:33 have there still would have been the only reason i didn't do that is because i actually was a little
01:18:37 afraid that i'd have to ban all my commenters like i was seriously like if i say that they're not
01:18:44 like they're not gonna believe like they're not gonna understand that i really mean that
01:18:48 and i will ban them all i've just realized we have completely opened ourselves up to a wall of
01:18:53 ironic comments it's gonna be yeah and we can ban them all yeah because they're all and all
01:19:01 and then people who commented before they got to this point that's you're gonna probably
01:19:06 you shouldn't listen to rule number one you gotta watch the whole video you're gonna get
01:19:10 definitely serious and you will always be banned from this there will be dozens and dozens maybe
01:19:16 hundreds of future pcp episodes and you will be egging to say stuff and you won't get to say any
01:19:22 of it and you will be crying on that day and will bury you you had to bury you in a termite
01:19:30 mountain termites will bite your dick until you're dead i'll put a baseball mitt full of ants on your
01:19:36 balls and they'll bite you on the balls i love how they bite your balls devoo always
01:19:43 frames every time someone offends someone in this group he always frames it as once we are really
01:19:48 famous you're gonna be so mad that's always i like that optimize when i'm king i will remember
01:19:54 everyone who slighted me and i will send assassins out across the far corners of the world to slay
01:20:00 to slay all the commenters date to put this simply yeah you can if you've already thought of the
01:20:08 phrase you can say it with me ironic shitposting is still shitposting yes that's the one that's the
01:20:16 one so how about we get to the the one that is my least my most hated one okay the arrogant smug
01:20:22 tone which people don't realize is a big problem they don't wait a minute devoo don't start tone
01:20:27 policing because that's a bannable offense for me i can't stand that shit okay for the content
01:20:32 all right listen when people say that the internet is a huge hive of scum and villainy the internet
01:20:38 is a full of a bunch of terrible people they are not talking about fourchan they're not talking about
01:20:44 people who say you're a fag with in all lower case i mean those guys are a big problem right
01:20:48 but the problem the problem with the internet is people who are like my friend you have really
01:20:55 disappointed me this is not good at all this is nothing i just got one of those right before
01:21:00 we started this fucking day sir the phrase my friend should be like autoband they always end
01:21:07 it with good day the one the ones i've seen the worst were on tom's video recently because
01:21:11 everyone's like dude what happened to love and tolerate brother i'll really let us down the
01:21:17 worst is when they combine that with hypocrisy when they're pissed like they're bitching at you for
01:21:22 being smug in a smug tone yeah don't ever don't ever dare to talk to me like some disappointed
01:21:28 parental figure or some friend you're not my friend the only one if you want to be my friend
01:21:33 become a patron at patreon.com slash ben saint mother fucker because look guys look guys being a troll
01:21:41 being an asshole being a flamer does not i mean okay look capitalization spelling that's a small
01:21:47 variable but that is not precluded there's so many people who will make something that's obviously
01:21:52 obviously meant to piss you off it's obviously trolling it's obviously baiting but they have
01:21:58 a decent vocabulary and they capitalize their their words and sentences and stuff and they think
01:22:04 that because they spelled everything right and didn't have too many exclamation marks it's all
01:22:09 about the exclamation marks right or words that are in all caps they think that's the definition
01:22:13 of trolling no it's not the definition of trolling is whether or not it pisses someone off and it
01:22:17 was intended to be so and so many people will come out with passive-aggressive smarmy terrible
01:22:22 comments and it will think that they're being they're they're fair criticism that's the fair
01:22:28 criticism nothing it says nothing works it's the song you guys have to understand there are so many
01:22:32 times and i think all of you guys would agree with this there are many times where i will add a bunch
01:22:36 exclamation marks or capitalize words to make me sound stupid to lower myself that's being humble
01:22:43 in my book and i can't do that anymore i used to do that more often where i'd be balanced where i
01:22:48 wanted to be like fun and and just like a normal person i'd be like you suck good you know like
01:22:53 even in this very chat like i'll say like these people these wine these scum will utilize they
01:23:00 will they will not let you get away with that they when someone gets into a flame war with you right
01:23:05 they are on turbo alert mode looking for anything you say that has two exclamation marks or more
01:23:10 so that they can then posit you as this you as this troll angry guy right they're looking for
01:23:15 anything they can use to discredit you you know and nothing bothers me more than hold it in their
01:23:20 heart and use it for for everything it's worth they will milk anything they can find to make it seem
01:23:26 like oh you're just being a big violent jerkface don't you realize and this is another fallacy
01:23:32 or as did you would say a fallacy that you can see around all of discussion is um i call it the uh
01:23:37 the first amendment kicks in when i get uncomfortable fallacy right which is i make a video
01:23:43 that's my free speech you make a comment that's your speech too i make a reply that's my speech
01:23:48 you make a reply that's your speech but then i make a reply that's really logical and trumps
01:23:52 trumps all of your ideas and now all of a sudden i'm trampling on i'm trampling on your ideas all
01:23:58 of a sudden the for all of a sudden the oppression begins when you run out of arguments right this
01:24:03 is the problem i've seen ever since the internet was invented in 1975 this this is the most substantive
01:24:09 complaint yet to do and i i very much agree i very much agree you know the saddest part about that
01:24:14 fallacy thing is that uh my best rap i ever wrote for the jephard jesson's father's following of
01:24:22 and i i can't like once i found out that that was the wrong pronunciation i thought oh gary no one
01:24:27 probably can take this seriously and i can't change it because the entire rhyme screen scheme is based
01:24:32 on it being pronounced i pronounce it fagotry that's a good way to pronounce it uh yeah no
01:24:40 smarm drives me crazy because it's this this whole attitude of if you don't have something nice to
01:24:47 say don't say anything at all but then you say that in in a bitchy way and it's like the what we need
01:24:54 to be doing as a society is getting to the point not being nice not not arguing in a way that fits
01:25:00 your parameters of how an argument should be it's getting to the point that world of only saying
01:25:04 nice things is is the medley or solitude nightmare you know that in one of my videos in one of my
01:25:09 videos i say faggot at one point which is very weird because my videos have very few squaring but
01:25:14 there's one time where i decide to use faggot right and i got some comments complaining about it
01:25:17 whatever and there was one that was like i can't believe you do that and i was like you know man
01:25:21 you know whatever yada yada and it shut up you faggot that would have been my response i have a
01:25:25 beautiful example for this one you're done by the way so okay because then you said just you know
01:25:29 shut up about it saying faggot is really annoying and i was like uh you know i i actually upvoted
01:25:35 that comment because he's just saying he just he stopped being all smarmy i want to elaborate on
01:25:39 that don't say that i was going to bring this up uh you people on the internet you commenters
01:25:45 you have ruined the word faggot for me forever like what is what a shame what a shame faggot
01:25:51 louis ck saved it and then it got ruined faggot yeah louis ck made people realize that they could
01:25:56 say it and then they went way too far with it like yeah faggot is like one of my favorite words
01:26:00 ever in the world it it's a beautiful word and it describes a person so nebulous that they can only
01:26:08 be described with that word which is why i am very careful with how i use the word faggot i only say
01:26:15 when there's an impact to it when it really matters and means what i'm trying to say it takes faggot
01:26:20 compilation you'll see exactly artistry at work every every time i've ever said faggot has been
01:26:23 totally 100 the best possible word i could have used at that given time but people throw faggot
01:26:29 around so much nowadays that it just robs the word of any agency and any impact and any meaning
01:26:35 and it drives me insane uh i you know i kind of disagree i i think the fact that it's so meaningless
01:26:40 is what i like it's not meaningless it describes a specific person that you can't describe with any
01:26:45 other word that's why it's so important to keep it put it perfectly when he said yeah you know the
01:26:50 he pulls the dick out of his mouth and says people from phoenix or phoenicia yeah shut up faggot
01:26:55 shut up and suck that dick yeah like that made perfect sense and unfortunately yeah i think it
01:27:00 has i agree with jesse that it's been ruined for me by other people and like i've tried to sort of
01:27:05 replace it with fuckboy because it means yeah that was great it describes the same kind of person
01:27:10 but it doesn't have it's too fun like faggot still sounds like an insult rest fuckboy is a little bit
01:27:16 too much you know how faggot should be used faggot should be like the nuclear option the kill code
01:27:22 like yeah like it should like randy orton's head punt he never he never uses it except sometimes
01:27:27 that when he uses it the guy is like injured for eight months it should be like when you're like
01:27:32 running down some guy with a huge string of insults you're stupid and you're dumb and you're gay and
01:27:36 you're a homo and you're ugly and you're fat and you're dumb and you're dumb and you're dumb and
01:27:39 you're a fucking faggot and then they're dead they are that's the way to do it by the way can
01:27:45 can we hear tom's example yeah i was gonna say the same thing well i mean we've we've kind of gone
01:27:50 off the rails went a different direction i was going to say how i just i don't like it when people
01:27:56 will will when you use like words like that when you use like risqué language or whatever and they
01:28:01 just fucking are on your dick on it instantly and like they take that holier than that thing like
01:28:07 when i said rape corporate raping of your childhood in the power puff girls video and then i just got
01:28:12 this guide like in before i'd even made it public i don't know how we found it i think i put in a
01:28:16 playlist or something and just fucking like when i'll preachy on me about how i'm not allowed to
01:28:20 use that word you need to stop normalizing rape with that kind of language brother that is not
01:28:24 accepted exactly what he said okay so i think you guys might want some guidelines but hang on
01:28:29 before before we get into that debut let me point out right now on dictionary dot com the third
01:28:35 definition of rape is an act of plunder violence seizure that's exactly what i said i responded
01:28:40 with that or violation it is the exact correct word to use for that yeah so people need to
01:28:45 fuck off that's what i said and then some of the respondents me saying that it's like citing the
01:28:49 dictionary is offensive what we know the dictionary isn't isn't what describes words people
01:28:58 decide what words mean and well i will say that sometimes people will be like oh you're not using
01:29:04 this word the exact way i would which they're using it wrong and like go look up the definition one
01:29:08 one time one guy said go look up the definition of the world should he misbed he misspelled word
01:29:14 would and i got on his ass for that all right listen you guys want some i just want to say real
01:29:17 quick tom i don't think i've ever wanted to kill a man more than i have based on what you just
01:29:21 described to me but okay debu let's actually i before debu continues actually sorry i keep cutting
01:29:26 you off but mate i have to know yeah with your final fantasy seven video okay where you like
01:29:32 literally depicted a rape of yep oh yeah how did that go over you know amazingly i only got one
01:29:40 comment that said like ooh was a little uncomfortable with that last scene but overall great video
01:29:44 amazing i was like oh my god when you put that in i know i was debating whether or not i should
01:29:49 just remove it entirely but people actually were okay with it except for one guy who was only a
01:29:54 little uncomfortable but and and that video got like 25 000 views and only one comment really
01:29:59 was amazing okay so i got one winner i like to think that it was due to my jovial tone
01:30:04 overall people were accepting anybody let's go on so you guys want some advice on how to not be
01:30:08 smarmy right so first point don't have short sentences short sentences with very few words
01:30:14 and lots of periods and redundant terminology using the same words over and over again the same
01:30:20 words all the time people do that deliberately to piss you off it makes them sound like they're so
01:30:25 i don't know why it is nothing is more passive it's very nothing is more passive aggressive than
01:30:30 no you don't because yeah yeah this is how it you know i've got exactly what the dude said
01:30:37 oh really okay okay you know i don't like it's true long comments are bad uh short comments are
01:30:43 maybe a little bit better but you know you should just take it the one step further and just not
01:30:46 comment which is really the ultimate uh conclusion i'd like to get to here just don't comment that's
01:30:51 the biggest rule just don't you know go away if you've ever seen the welcome to youtube video
01:30:55 yeah where he said uh hit now for how to comment don't yeah it stands for this don't it stands for
01:31:05 don't i think this is the number one point i can make about how to not be a big smug prick
01:31:11 uh just represent yourself instead of saying this video uh offended this group minority that
01:31:18 i don't represent instead of saying this video has broken this law of conduct and this video has
01:31:24 done this wrong this video has violated this this memo no you have to you have to defend your idea
01:31:31 yeah just say this just stick with this this video pissed me off you know what right that
01:31:38 kind of comment wouldn't really bother me you see it's it's not the fact that people just look
01:31:42 people just liking a video of mine you know that's kind of disappointing right but what
01:31:47 offends me is when people try to represent something beyond themselves all you gotta do is
01:31:53 there's nothing that's more annoying that people getting offended on other people's behalf that's a
01:31:57 big problem that's a universal thing you can see in in comments they're big smug people is that they
01:32:02 always they don't seem to think that they themselves are a valuable resource like go out to their
01:32:07 garage and sit on a squat over the car and just poop on it i want to poop on your car as a human being
01:32:12 i have enough respect for you that if you say something such and such bothers me i can respect
01:32:18 that i can respect that that's how you feel about something but it's that they didn't try to make
01:32:23 it that i make it out like a sort of imaginary rule book for videos that i'm violating which isn't
01:32:28 true that's like i don't know what the definition we gotta stop devu i know you're trying to like
01:32:33 just continue your point even though jesse is mumbling i want to go into your house with a
01:32:37 tooth drive and i want to say i want to poop in the hard to find places so you don't know where
01:32:41 the smell is coming from and you have to live with it forever you just want to do what you poop i want
01:32:45 to poop poop on you want to poop poop on commenters you go do that commenters are pooping i poop on
01:32:51 them okay look commenters are pooping i poop on them comment there the chest pooping is yeah
01:32:58 like uh because like that uh that one right at moderator from a couple episodes ago whatever you
01:33:02 one thing i told him was don't try to represent some sort of objective standard all you got to do
01:33:07 to get our attention to get my attention to make a comment that will leave an impact on me is just
01:33:11 say such and such bothers me and then i can decide whether or not to take that seriously like yeah
01:33:20 everything that pisses me off almost all the piss i've ever had towards comments is that
01:33:25 pretense that you represent something that you don't that's all i want that and i think you're
01:33:29 totally right the only problem is that is that people who are all into collectivism and shit
01:33:32 and feeling offended for other things they take personal offense from being other people being
01:33:37 offended so they are well my god there's just no winning there's no way to win that fight i think
01:33:42 well i mean when it comes to words and stuff yeah but that doesn't apply to like oh you didn't
01:33:49 structure your review correctly you know they're inventing something imaginary like who are you
01:33:55 who are these fucking people saying you didn't structure have you ever made a fucking video
01:33:58 do you know what it's like to be on youtube god these these fucking backseat youtubers
01:34:02 there's nothing worse than them those people need to fucking burn i like that term no like
01:34:07 if someone says this video is offensive then the only response you need to make is maybe for you
01:34:14 but it's not offensive and my god like it's not offensive for the people who liked it who and
01:34:18 that's who i made it for i didn't make it for you offending someone like a bannable offense like
01:34:23 this is the real world we're living in if an idea offends you you can say that that's fine right
01:34:28 that doesn't make it objectively wrong some things are offensive it all comes back once again into
01:34:33 and right offense is always it all comes back again into what do what not knowing what we want out
01:34:39 of our videos right again if you're leaving a comment saying you did this wrong you really
01:34:44 don't know what we were intending to do maybe i wanted to offend you maybe i just didn't think
01:34:51 it was offensive maybe in my culture being offended by that thing i said is offensive to me
01:34:57 like sometimes sometimes the things that offend other people i am offended that it offends them
01:35:03 that is a thing i have experienced right so like yeah circular triggering is a real thing folks
01:35:09 right and once again you don't need to leave your offended comment on my video it's not my job to
01:35:15 give you that platform you have everywhere on the internet too now i understand that because my
01:35:20 comments are open you probably will leave the comment on my video but guess what i'm going to
01:35:25 delete it because i have the power to do that don't want your comment deleted leave it somewhere else
01:35:30 go on twitter and talk about that makes comments suck is i think you know they get frustrated
01:35:34 because they know something pissed them off and i think it comes from the futility that they feel
01:35:39 that this guy's not going to read my comment i'm wasting my time this guy's just gonna say what he
01:35:43 says in his own bubble and he's never gonna even hear me out and that frustration makes their comment
01:35:47 more bitchy right so here's another rule assume that they're going to read the comments because
01:35:52 unless they get hundreds of thousands of views on every video yeah they probably actually at least
01:35:58 skim all the comments you don't people don't underestimate how much youtubers read their
01:36:02 comments most of the time and the real the thing is that that because they get pissed off they don't
01:36:06 want to put in the effort to read the other comments to see if that correction's already been made
01:36:11 they they go into base things like using short sentences they go into all the other problems
01:36:16 that we just talked about because of that frustration that feeling that it's going to be
01:36:19 thrown in the garbage anyway well you know what that's the wrong way of looking at it look at it
01:36:23 like it will get thrown in the garbage unless you calm down and try to say something insightful
01:36:27 because our whole careers here on youtube is about saying things that are insightful
01:36:32 even if it is very critical and that's what i'll say this like i you know i've made it sound like
01:36:37 i delete fucking comments all the time and i do but most of the comments i delete are the ones that
01:36:42 that have no recourse where it's just like fuck you you're a piece of shit and i just delete that
01:36:46 guy and ban that guy you know and also meaningful statement i also will say that like a lot of my
01:36:51 bands are based on if a lot of my bands aren't because of criticism per se they're because
01:36:58 someone either admitted that they downvoted the video or admitted that they unsubscribe oh yeah
01:37:03 that's another thing don't pretend to have some sort of some sort of affection for me when they're
01:37:07 like i unsubscribe really i've never seen any of your comments on any of my other videos oh right
01:37:11 you unsubscribe on my roller coaster three video a video i posted almost a year ago what kind of
01:37:16 subscriber are you taking so long to watch my damn videos i don't believe you for one second
01:37:21 continuing what i was saying that i he's i don't what i don't usually ban is people who who are just
01:37:27 like you know making an argument and i'll usually respond to them yeah and if they're being a dick
01:37:31 this has happened countless times where someone will say something they'll leave a comment in a way
01:37:36 that's kind of like an asshole and then i'll respond and then they will apologize
01:37:41 because where are these people coming from i never get anyone apologizing i get it i never get
01:37:46 apologies all the time i get it all the time no you know because i hate these posts well the
01:37:51 view the difference is that you often respond to people being an asshole by being an asshole
01:37:57 no no no no no no no i do it in ways that that can diffuse the situation what's going on with jesse
01:38:02 over there listen i was slapping the microphone with my wiener context
01:38:10 no that's constructive commentary the vast majority of the comments i got on my big videos
01:38:14 have been like ways to diffuse it but it doesn't work so i'm not gonna i'm not i've
01:38:18 haven't been an asshole in return although i will i am open to the idea that maybe there's
01:38:22 a diffusal technique that i need to learn do you know what i mean whenever someone apologizes please
01:38:26 link me that comment so i can learn how you do it i will i will next time it happens but i get a
01:38:30 lot of those were just someone responds in a way where they're like they disagree with the video but
01:38:34 they phrase it in a really douchey way and i'll usually respond like well my intention was this
01:38:40 and this is what i was trying to communicate yeah i've done that and i and most of the time they
01:38:44 just don't reply i never get i never have gotten a single call the worst the worst the worst fucking
01:38:51 response is when someone will be a complete dick and just try and like shut you down and then you
01:38:55 respond and like just annihilate their argument like calm down bro it's just kidding
01:39:04 if you say anything to someone with even a little bit of edge or if you use it like
01:39:07 a swear word suddenly you're automatically in the wrong because you got angry well mother fucker
01:39:12 if you're saying stupid bullshit on my video yes i am angry i have a right to be where the
01:39:17 comment and i'm just getting where the fuck they want yeah just remember that guy on you um
01:39:21 you're the content creator you're supposed to be the bigger person and i know tom that's
01:39:25 infuriating it's fucking bullshit this guy started i'm not going to read the whole comment
01:39:29 but he's like i tend to agree with your point yada yada i think you missed his opportunity yada yada
01:39:33 and so then you respond um going you just respond like i went off on that motherfucker
01:39:38 i fucking burned him at the stake you at the end and so his reply is wow period okay period oh god
01:39:45 no never say yeah wow yeah and he even goes he even goes i'm even at the end he goes i'm a fan
01:39:51 and i'm not unsubscribing because i like your content but when a fan when a fan he says they
01:39:57 like your stuff and then tells you who who are you think you have a fucking opinion that's worth
01:40:03 anything you're nothing you're worthless i here's oh no you're gonna unsubscribe guess what five
01:40:09 fucking people just replace you subscribe he's saying guys i could unsubscribe but i've decided
01:40:13 have mercy on you i'm gonna be very generous and not unsubscribe oh well he's not merciful what a
01:40:19 good i went off on that motherfucker and i hope he has cancer you know what you know what that is
01:40:23 when someone went when he said like wow period okay period you know what that is it's the internet
01:40:29 equivalent of when somebody starts a fight gets their ass kicked and then stands up and goes come
01:40:34 on pussy come on i'm still going i still want to fight i'm telling you i'm telling you if anyone
01:40:38 ever fucking does that to me you are never getting invited back to gurren lagoon you're never
01:40:44 never guys i gotta i gotta make this i want to make this comparison all right because the thing
01:40:50 about the internet and the reason that people feel so entitled to say this shit is that it's so
01:40:54 abstracted right right exactly we're all we're all far apart from each other we're all on our own
01:40:58 screens you don't visualize it as people being there but the thing is that when i post a video
01:41:04 and 2000 views get onto it in 30 minutes that means that basically everyone's in the same place
01:41:10 we're all doing the same thing we're all at our computer we're all watching the same video we're
01:41:14 all there and i'm standing there like when i post a video imagine this is the exact scenario that i
01:41:20 think it's comparable to you know when there's those movie screenings where the director is there
01:41:25 where the director like like will will be will will they'll show the movie the director's there at
01:41:30 the end he might do like a q&a or something right and that's typically like how these these work
01:41:36 i post a video and i'm sitting there on youtube after i like it's not like i post a video and
01:41:42 then i disappear you know i don't fucking i don't post my video and then immediately go on a globetrotting
01:41:48 adventure or something like that's not what happens i post it and then i sit there for two hours
01:41:54 and read and respond to comments as they come and imagine when i when i when i post up a video
01:42:01 and then i see comments coming onto the video before the runtime of the video is over that's what
01:42:05 all starts to go downhill imagine yourself in a theater that that theater situation where the
01:42:10 director is there and people are standing up and shouting first while watching the movie you would
01:42:20 so deeply offend that direct they would kick you out of the theater first of all you would immediately
01:42:25 be removed from the video because the venue itself has rules about this right the no one would comment
01:42:31 before the movie was over once the director came out nobody would say you fucking suck you'd get
01:42:36 kicked out you would get banned you would get blocked if the director comes out people stand up
01:42:42 they give a round of applause even if you didn't like the movie stay sitting down don't say anything
01:42:46 don't fucking you know or leave get up and leave because you the movie obviously didn't
01:42:52 resonate with you you it wasn't for you it was for those people who were standing up clapping
01:42:57 that's the like bar when the movie ends and everybody stands up and claps that's the like bar
01:43:00 on the video yeah this the dislike bar is shouldn't even exist really because it i mean i i like the
01:43:08 dislike bar only for when it's showing a mass dissatisfaction with something yeah i think it
01:43:13 can be yeah yeah i'm with you on this point i i do agree that there's there's something definitely
01:43:18 to be said about uh the environment you're in and the types of comments that are made but i guess
01:43:23 it's just i i this is a totally separate point now but i really think it's important to have a place
01:43:29 where you can just fucking vent and that's why i love 4chan so much but that yeah that's why 4chan's
01:43:34 there though you could go on 4chan and do that i would love it if every time someone got mad about
01:43:39 my video they went and complained about it on 4chan yeah not in my fucking comments because
01:43:45 again to bring it back to that movie scenario if the director is standing there on the front of the
01:43:49 stage and someone has it like let's say there was a rape scene in the movie yeah and someone gets up
01:43:53 and they say like like this would be an appropriate response you'd expect at a theater uh that rape
01:44:00 scene made me a little bit uncomfortable so i'm curious as to why you put it in there what was
01:44:05 your intentions with showcasing that were you trying to offend or did you have like what was
01:44:10 your intent what was the message you were trying to communicate and then once the director tells you
01:44:14 what message he was trying to communicate you can decide in your head well i don't agree with the way
01:44:19 he presented it you don't have to you don't even have to say anything you can just know that in your
01:44:23 mind right if you got up in that theater and you said how dare you depict rape the way you did
01:44:31 then the director is gonna say fuck off i get out of my theater you know this is what i'm saying
01:44:35 like people because of the abstraction of the internet they don't think of it this way but this
01:44:39 is exactly what it is i am there i am the director of the video i am listening to your comments and
01:44:45 when you come out screaming that is no socially different from standing up in the theater and
01:44:51 yelling at the i think it's a little different but i hear what you're saying okay here's here's
01:44:56 something kind of semi-related based on that is something that really drives me crazy is when
01:45:02 because like we're talking about how people will comment and like you're sitting there especially
01:45:06 in the beginning like reading the comments because like yeah you want to see what the reaction is to
01:45:09 your work it drives me fucking crazy especially because i'm not a big channel when people will
01:45:15 talk about me like i'm not there i prefer to be like in like a third person or just like
01:45:20 talk amongst themselves does this yeah and it's just like i'm right here of this video
01:45:27 that is yeah that brings me to another rule okay do not
01:45:32 shit talk the video makers friends you idiots yeah this happens to all of us especially
01:45:40 like there have been because and this happened to me and tom i think more than anybody else right
01:45:45 where me and tom were both big in the pony community at a time and we would both cover
01:45:50 every new episode of a show and me and tom were good friends and if you watched our content you
01:45:54 would know that because we collaborated all the time we hung out we had all these interactions
01:45:59 with each other and there would be people who would like comment on one of our videos about
01:46:05 how shit the other guys was and like oh they would comment on tom's videos like tom i'm so glad
01:46:12 that you're acting like this because digi lately it's just been a like a piece of shit like loser
01:46:16 and i'm like i read tom's comments you're you're talking to me in front of my face this is happening
01:46:23 to me so much digi on your top 10 youtuber youtube videos video yeah because you put me in both
01:46:30 number two spots and so all these normies from your channel who didn't know about me you didn't
01:46:35 like understand my content immediately had to spout off some opinion about it so you get all
01:46:40 these people like this this one guy was like just use okay sometimes but i don't like he he seems
01:46:46 like a bad but like totally misunderstanding my intent like the most obvious the most obviously
01:46:51 stupid one is when digi bro's channel was down briefly and then uh on the gibbentake channel
01:46:57 hippo oh yeah and people like oh fuck digi and fuck digi and it's like how could anyone who follows
01:47:03 the gibbentake channel possibly like know about digi but also not realize that they're friends
01:47:08 well like i remember that time i think digi could possibly be we're saying like really dismissive
01:47:12 things like right yeah this guy looks dumb you know like even though digi just got done
01:47:18 explaining to you why i like succeeded in like breaking the boundaries or like transcending
01:47:25 whatever the fuck i was doing and like he says like it's not forever but he tells you why the video
01:47:29 was good and why you should give it a chance and they're still being dismissive about it and then
01:47:32 like i gotta do like a whole big thing with these two dipshit commenters on digi's videos
01:47:36 and this one guy he kept like he kept saying the word brony at me as though it were an insult
01:47:43 like uh you used to brony go back and review my the pony videos and it's like do you know
01:47:48 who you're fucking subscribed to oh god that's the kind of calling me as though it's an insult
01:47:54 digi bro is the reason there is a brony fandom you dumb fuck well i guess no brony
01:48:01 some people i would say that digi is 25 percent at least of why there is a persistent
01:48:06 my little pony fandom something like that something like that i think yeah like did you
01:48:12 made all these thirsty ass guys be like oh my god i can make money talking about fucking ponies on
01:48:16 youtube i'm in which is exactly why i got into it too so and this is also like this is part of why
01:48:22 i grew to eventually like really resent a lot of the other my little pony reviewers right right
01:48:28 they never stuck up for it like like with me and tom when people would insult one of us
01:48:34 we would stick up for each other we'd be like hey you know digi watches my videos or hey you know
01:48:39 tom is my friend right you know like get the fuck out of here with that shit there's a lot of like
01:48:45 all these pony youtubers who were all like directly inspired by me yeah they would get all these
01:48:50 comments about how oh you're so much better than digi bro he's such a shit and they would never
01:48:54 say anything about it they would never like uh they would never attack those people they'd never
01:48:58 be like oh no they're thrown they want that thrown to empty it because they don't want to stick up for
01:49:04 anyone least of all right friends or themselves and i'm like i'm like if i inspired you you should
01:49:08 like okay imagine like like i've talked about a lot about ghost lightning right and how he inspired
01:49:14 me to get into blogging if someone came into my video and was like man that ghost lightning guy
01:49:19 his blog went so downhill i'm so glad that you you were such a good dude i'd be like get the fuck
01:49:24 out of here because that guy is that guy is the entire reason i even do this because he inspired
01:49:29 me and there's people who directly have like told me that i was the reason that they started doing
01:49:34 youtube yeah and then they get comments that are like fuck digi bro and they don't say anything and
01:49:39 i know why it's because it makes them feel good they feel good that they are getting praised over a
01:49:44 famous guy over a guy who has more attention than they do so they're like oh you know even though i
01:49:51 don't agree with this at least uh oh yeah i get to fuck you all right if you don't defend the fact that
01:49:56 i inspired you to make your videos you exist because of me you fucking pieces of shit do not pull
01:50:03 and i'm not saying this just to be arrogant for myself i feel this way about everyone who inspired
01:50:07 me if someone throw them stone if someone fucking came to my video and was talking shit about any of
01:50:12 the video make even uh you guys have seen how defensive i get of even ego raptor and i don't
01:50:17 even think he's making good videos anymore but every time someone talks shit about ego raptor i'm
01:50:20 like well i wouldn't be here if not for you always dependent when i talk about game grunts you're
01:50:24 always there digi haters when you guys channeled lead it i was on that equestria daily thread
01:50:28 responding to all my god i i got banned from equestria daily banned from equestria daily uh
01:50:35 oh what a for love for for like being too correct i wasn't even being angry at them now you know i
01:50:40 think that's another theory i have as to why people put up with that kind of hatred it's because a
01:50:44 lot of people don't mind all of the hateful comments as much in general this brings me to the most
01:50:49 offensive but most like possibly the most impactful point i'm gonna make is i think a lot of people
01:50:55 listening to this who maybe even have a little bit of content themselves and they they're listening
01:50:59 to our complaints and they're like yeah you know you guys make a bunch of good points but negative
01:51:03 comments still don't bother me that much and i don't really relate to your guys's opinions well i have
01:51:07 your own throat motherfucker because i'm more important than you and they bother me
01:51:11 well you know that's kind of what i'm about to say you see he's gonna say it's an issue of scale
01:51:15 right well no no it's because it used to be because i've been on the internet forever right
01:51:21 ever since it was invented in 1937 and yeah uh and i would make stuff i would throw stuff out there
01:51:27 and i didn't really have a whole lot of passion i i i wanted to do something but i didn't have a
01:51:31 clear goal a clear motivation then there wasn't anything that i ever like really poured my soul
01:51:35 into and if someone criticized it i was like you know i don't really care it was only when i started
01:51:40 really caring about the stuff that i was making uh that you know it started to really get under my
01:51:45 skin more you know people misinterpreting your intentions is more offensive when you have more
01:51:50 intentions so i just want people to reflect on themselves about that that if you don't think
01:51:54 that offensive comments are that offensive maybe it's because you're not very creative or very
01:51:59 driven rather you know i know that's a really harsh point to make but i think it's probably very
01:52:03 fucking true because like i'm i'm working on like i still do reviews on on on my first channel
01:52:09 but i mean i don't really care too much anymore it's just i'm doing it because like there are
01:52:13 occasionally topics that i like talking about and that's how i make money and so like when people
01:52:17 like blew up on the video i made yesterday like i knew it was gonna incite shit i didn't care it was
01:52:21 just like a dumb thing i wanted to do and like whatever but you know when when there's projects
01:52:25 that i like i legitimately care about i'm way more defensive about it i mean that's why i'm like
01:52:29 stalling trying to make this motion comment because like my like soul is in this project
01:52:33 and like i'm going to be using it to like examine a bunch of like my own commenters can't relate to
01:52:37 that because they don't have souls right it's they're not real human beings they're not really
01:52:42 like that's when when they say shit like that it's way worse because like i remember i started doing
01:52:46 some writing stuff like a couple years ago and like i was like really like putting my own stat
01:52:51 and someone's like oh can i can i look at your work i want to i want to you know like i write
01:52:55 stuff too i want to help you i'm like okay like yeah and like i've been i wrote like one thing
01:52:59 like a week ago it's the first thing i ever wrote he just came back like this shit this is all
01:53:02 shit is fucking awful like why are you even trying and like that's stung like shit because like he
01:53:08 came in like trying to be helpful and then just like shit on it with like reckless abandon and yeah
01:53:14 that's actually really clever and sinister like yeah if i really hated someone if somebody like
01:53:21 left a shit comment and they had videos on their channel i would go to their channel and i'd be like
01:53:25 hey can i do you mind if i watch some videos i think you have a lot of potential maybe i could
01:53:29 watch your videos and i would wait for like a week and i'd come back and i'd fucking destroy
01:53:35 every single fucking thing about their lives and they would die the worst thing that ever happened
01:53:40 to me with with something like that is like there was this guy who was my biggest patron for a year
01:53:46 and a half he would give me a hundred dollars of video wow and and and he did that for like a year
01:53:52 and a half and it took me a year and a half to realize he actually hated me and was trying to
01:53:57 like make me depressed and he gave me like a thousand dollars yeah like and we it eventually
01:54:03 boiled down to this huge fucking argument whoa um when okay that guy is actually psychotic
01:54:09 wow he is dude that's insane he got you tom he he gave you a thousand dollars he sure he sure got
01:54:16 you man hey hey what do you say in this final confrontation go to patreon.com by all means if
01:54:23 you think i'm the worst guy ever please patreon.com slash did you direct all hate comments to the
01:54:29 patreon exclusive section you will ruin my life all right what did he say what was his argument at
01:54:35 the end of that there was this posse of kids who like hung around me and like laughed at every stupid
01:54:39 joke i made and other kids were like dude they're just mocking you who cares there's this group of
01:54:43 people around here who pretend to love me it's great i don't feel offended at all that's like
01:54:47 the internet equivalent of wimp low like they trained him wrong as a joke yeah yeah money is gonna
01:54:53 destroy you yeah by the way if you want a little money no problems right make make comments like i
01:54:59 love you your videos are amazing those are always good yeah right those comments are always nice i
01:55:05 like well sometimes just just like uh yeah um oh shit i forgot what i was gonna say could you
01:55:12 say your thing yeah tom what what happened at the end of that i mean it was it was like what happened
01:55:16 is he gave me a bunch of money for a while then stopped and then we were friends did we just continue
01:55:20 like at that point it like sharply declined in terms of like being friendly but at that point i
01:55:26 assumed he was my friend because it's been like almost a year and it just like constant prodding
01:55:31 because like he knew that i'd like you know like i'm i'm i'd have like intermittent depression
01:55:35 and stuff and he would play off of that and like just like say a bunch of shit and like do a bunch
01:55:40 of things what is this guy a pickup artist trying to get in your pants is he negging you hey there's
01:55:46 nothing wrong with being a sociopath pickup artist it's the right way to live let's not let's not
01:55:51 throw stones at that you know it's it's funny what davu was saying and i guess his ultimate point
01:55:56 was like if you're passionate then it matters more and i guess i've always been passionate but like
01:56:01 i back in the day got even more mad at like negative comments than i do now like i've never
01:56:07 never been able to take criticism i've always been passionate i've not always been confident
01:56:12 there wasn't always individual pieces of art that i put a lot of work into and thought were good
01:56:17 i don't i don't have the ability to delusionally think my content is better than it is you know
01:56:22 it's it's almost funny because before i started on youtube i didn't really have a response to
01:56:27 everything anyone would say at me i do now people can say anything they want about me and i'll
01:56:31 have i don't know like a bunch of shit i can regurgitate that of and it's always correct you
01:56:35 know it's funny how it's always correct i don't even plan that it just happens that way anyway this
01:56:39 is going on really long does anybody have any we should we should list any more points we have
01:56:43 i still have a few i still have a few that okay let's let's get to those let's get to that well
01:56:47 people who think that they're being cute or endearing by insulting me you're not you don't
01:56:51 know me like that you're not my fucking friend you don't get to insult me um let's see uh comments
01:56:55 about my appearance uh uh okay always irrelevant always a little bit hurtful and you would never
01:57:02 fucking say it to my face or you i would strangle you and kill you so don't fucking say it on the
01:57:06 internet because you wouldn't say it i gotta jump in on that too man because again obviously i get
01:57:10 it all the fucking time with the beard and like here's the like okay sometimes people joke about
01:57:15 the beard and sometimes it can be funny and i don't i don't mind being like kind of a meme
01:57:21 you know like on some level like kind of like anthony fantano he's bald and people call him a
01:57:25 melon and it's funny and he's in on the joke and he clearly appreciates that joke because it came
01:57:30 from a funny place where it was like someone some artist he reviewed like negatively like legitimately
01:57:36 called him a melon as it like like i'm all angry at him yeah and so people picked up on that and
01:57:40 started calling him that and it's funny and he likes it and there's certain memes and stuff
01:57:44 that are that can be fun obviously i look like a fucking weirdo i appreciate that and himself
01:57:50 aware of it and like and it can be funny to talk about but like if all you have to say is like uh
01:57:57 shave your face it's like dude i don't belong to you i am not i'm not here to look how you want
01:58:03 me to look if i was i wouldn't look like i i don't understand how people seem to think that
01:58:08 youtubers are so unself aware like we talk this this kind of goes back to the authorial intent
01:58:13 thing where i was saying that like people watch your videos and they somehow think that you don't
01:58:18 know what's in them you know like i'm a guy who writes intensely deeply analytical content
01:58:26 about shows i break down like visual aesthetics on a regular basis i know how i look you know
01:58:34 well yeah i'm a writer uh like how do you not how do you not get what that i like i have to edit
01:58:40 these videos i have to see myself on camera i know what my beard looks like i know what i look like
01:58:46 and the reason that i haven't changed it is either obviously a i don't care or b i like the way i
01:58:52 look and there's people who say things like one recently that just pissed me off so much i couldn't
01:58:57 stop thinking about it this this happens to be a lot so some people know how to phrase a comment
01:59:01 in just such a way that i that i just like i can't believe that they said it yeah and like and it
01:59:08 just burrows into my brain all day and based on the phrasing like if it gets to a nine out of ten
01:59:13 on the smug scale i ban it's like i'm gonna go i said on my on my on my final fantasy seven video
01:59:18 from like a year ago now or something yeah like i got so many like oh this guy he's just he's got
01:59:23 this big beard and he's got a hawaiian shirt i don't accidentally have a big beard in a hawaiian
01:59:29 shirt in that video i grew it because i wanted it and i put the shirt on because it looks cool
01:59:35 fuck you the comment that got to me so much though that was recent was like someone saying
01:59:41 i don't understand how he thinks that beard looks good he he should like beards are meant to be
01:59:48 taken care of they're not meant to just be grown have had god you're violating beard was all i could
01:59:53 think was why does he think that i grew this to look good why would like is that what we assume
02:00:03 everyone everyone's completely obsessed with their appearance and all they care about is looking
02:00:08 perfect at all times let me jump in real quick right there because i have a 10 out of 10 perfect
02:00:12 specimen of a man and the only comments i get on my appearance are to say how beautiful i am so you
02:00:17 made a video yeah where you deliberately looked shitty that's true for the message of the video
02:00:22 and i remember when i clicked on it when i clicked on growing the gun part one you said to me
02:00:26 name why you look like such a fucking scrub in this video right the very first thing i thought
02:00:30 was like what the fuck why is he look because i i remember i know what you look like i'd met you
02:00:34 and i was like did he like completely go downhill in the time since i last saw him and then the video
02:00:40 turns out is about you transforming and and i didn't leave that comment because i finished the video
02:00:45 and then i told you that i had thought that at first and then i and then later in the video it
02:00:50 was proven see yours he's applying several of the rules that we've educated you on in this thing
02:00:54 and i completely didn't see it coming yeah it was just like i saw you as like a nerd and then you
02:00:59 you evolved and i was like oh that's fucking genius because i was thinking about how shitty you
02:01:03 looked and now you look amazing and it's awesome like that's sometimes the point like i like that
02:01:09 i am this character who is this like weird crazy hobo who lives in a dungeon of anime posters
02:01:15 it's hilarious to me and if you watch my after dark channel that that comes through more because
02:01:20 i wear the sunglasses and do weird shit you know like like it's it's obvious but like that's why
02:01:26 i said comments about the beard will be deleted because like i i know i know everything you can
02:01:33 say about it i know what it looks like the reason the beard looks so shitty on camera by the way
02:01:38 is usually because if you actually saw it it yeah it's usually because of the lighting because
02:01:42 in order to make your face appear on camera when you're filming in the middle of the night
02:01:46 you have to light yourself really well and when all that light goes through all the the scraggly
02:01:51 part of my beard it looks really bad if you saw me in person it never looks like that it looks way
02:01:58 more full it looks completely together because i don't have a fucking halogen light blasting on me
02:02:04 when i'm when i'm doing it you know and people like people don't get that that you can film from
02:02:09 different angles and different lightings and everything makes it look different everything
02:02:13 will everything you do will make you look completely different and there's some videos that i've posted
02:02:17 where people will be like oh man you look like you lost weight and you look like uh like you
02:02:22 like you cleaned yourself up and literally all i did was wear a tighter shirt and film from a
02:02:26 downward angle with better lighting like right sometimes i don't have time to set all that up
02:02:32 you know and it's like i i wish people understood why i look the way i do but like all i can assure
02:02:39 you is that i know i know exactly what i look like in the video i edited it half of my career
02:02:45 is analyzing aesthetics it's interesting digi i'm learning something about the differences between
02:02:49 you and i because i'm the kind of guy who takes six months to make a video that will in no way
02:02:56 be worth the effort that's expanded on it to make sure i get all those little details perfect
02:03:00 whereas you take the obviously superior approach of being like well i'm not going to fucking put
02:03:05 the time in to get this done that's retarded no one in the world to do that there's no way i can
02:03:10 it's completely impractical videos that i do because like i i i have ideas for videos constantly
02:03:15 you know and sometimes there's like with that whole the video that was uh that was positive
02:03:22 reviews like here's positive reviews i've done the the only incentive for that video was not to
02:03:27 make a good video it was to make one at that moment right because i was about to make two very negative
02:03:33 reviews about very popular shows right after people have been saying that i've been getting
02:03:38 really negative with my videos and my most recent popular ones were negative videos so i thought
02:03:42 let's counterbalance this and draw attention to positive videos i've made it wouldn't have worked
02:03:47 if i posted it two weeks later it would have no point because i would already be done with the
02:03:52 negative videos and moving on so like the only incentive was how can i get a video out tonight
02:03:58 that proves that i've that i've made positive videos i don't have victor available to light me
02:04:02 well or shoot me with a nice camera because he's been working for all fucking week i don't have
02:04:07 i don't want to show off too much of my room because i'm planning to use parts of my room
02:04:11 for a different video and i don't want it to be shown before then i can't necessarily set up
02:04:16 everything to look good so let's just fucking turn on the camera and ramble and if i'm if i'm lucky
02:04:22 if if my fans are are fucking decent enough people then when i nicely ask them not to
02:04:28 fucking talk about my beard maybe they won't do it how wrong ever was i maybe all right jesse we're
02:04:35 let's let's move on to some of these other points okay i've been wanting to say this this whole
02:04:41 damn podcast oh hey you know i can be able to spend a little bit more i have a really minor
02:04:46 point that'll take one minute you shut your fucking face god damn it you people you can go after me
02:04:54 you people out there do not ever ever
02:05:06 use my full name or my real name ever don't do it you're not my friends you're not a person in
02:05:16 my life you don't know me like that my name is endless jess that's the name of my channel you
02:05:21 can call me that or one of my other 10 000 monikers you can call me drowning in footwear you
02:05:25 can call me the fucking horseshoe boy you can call me whatever the hell you want but jesse wood is for
02:05:30 my fucking friends jesse is for my friends and i can't even describe why exactly it makes my skin
02:05:37 crawl so much it feels like a violation it feels like rape like somebody is in my kitchen touching
02:05:42 my shit or messing around with my stuff it feels dirty don't do it do not call me by my real name
02:05:49 don't ever ever fucking do it jesse ever i i agree with you and i think that i think that it's
02:05:55 with in your case it's a little bit your fault and a lot our fault yeah yeah we're definitely
02:06:01 culpable because we always because we all called you jessie wood no one name to right seriously
02:06:05 have the entire umbrella even if it's a positive comment or a nice comment if you use my real name
02:06:11 i feel i feel raped and i don't respect you as a person and i don't like for the record jess
02:06:15 you have you like well i don't know if you did it in any of the videos that are still available
02:06:19 well yeah because when i started out i stupidly didn't know what i wanted to call myself yet yeah
02:06:24 a man makes mistakes you know in the in the uh the manly lessons to manhood video you're like
02:06:29 i'm jesse wood which is part of why that video doesn't exist anymore right but like yeah i but i
02:06:34 completely get where you're coming from because like well your username is i think the reason
02:06:38 that it happens with you is that a your old usernames were all difficult to use as names and
02:06:43 your you new username is so close to your real name that people just assume that that's just
02:06:47 what to use and sometimes we mean we want to describe like you as a person as distinct from all
02:06:52 the different subsets of you that exist it's like it's hard to describe but i i think endless jess
02:06:57 i think endless jessum rellis them all pretty well yeah which is why i've started calling you
02:07:01 i'm like a hannard people from mass effect okay i got my face name and that's republic
02:07:05 and i got my soul name and that's for my peeps and you ain't my reason i agree with you though
02:07:10 is that i get this sometimes where there's certain people who call me i don't even fucking call
02:07:14 you conrad i can't do it right it was weird no dude it's super weird to me because never
02:07:21 have i put out there that it was that i am conrad it's my you guys are my closest friends online
02:07:27 you all call me digi everyone online calls me digi my name is always digi bro it always is
02:07:33 there's never not the case when people but here's the thing here's why it bothers me because when
02:07:37 people call me conrad especially like with jessie i get that maybe they don't understand that you
02:07:42 don't like to be called that but with conrad 100 of the time it feels like they're trying to be sneaky
02:07:48 it feels like they're trying to say i know more about you and i'm like oh i i'm closer to the
02:07:54 truth creepy sentiment that i've looked into you yeah right because like you only would know that
02:07:59 if you were watching like either watching like interviews or something or you saw me in like a
02:08:04 google hangout because my real name is on my google plus account so like you saw me in a google
02:08:08 hangout and you saw that it was conrad or you saw my facebook or something you saw or you listen to
02:08:13 this podcast well yeah or yeah this particular podcast is only or and i i'm a little bit more
02:08:18 forgiving when it's on digi bros because of the fact that you called your name there yeah right
02:08:24 like me and victor will be on there and victor will call me conrad that's like i think context
02:08:28 it was ego raptor then it became erin because everyone right like everyone calls him erin now
02:08:32 because it it became normal and like i'm more okay with people calling me conrad in the comments
02:08:37 of digi bros because i'm like yeah okay i get called conrad here all the time and like and it
02:08:42 doesn't feel sneaky it's never felt like they're trying to say it's sneaky because like that's
02:08:45 like one of the things that that guy was talking about earlier did because at one point when we
02:08:49 were still like he's still being chummy he bought something off of me so i sent it to him and then
02:08:54 he would start calling me by my real name in all of my comments and then he would mention my hometown
02:08:59 all the time where i live oh hey it's on balan of michigan whatever there is an issue of context
02:09:06 to it i guess because yeah on digi bros your conrad because it's you and your brother and i get why
02:09:11 they'd call you that or like for me like if i went and did like stand up or i released a stand-up cd
02:09:16 i don't know if i'd call myself endless jess on stage i might or i might just let them call me
02:09:21 jessie would if in that case maybe but when i'm on my fucking youtube channel it's like my wrestler
02:09:25 name okay you don't walk up to see him punk and say hey phil you just don't do it he'll punch you
02:09:29 he'll beat you up and i'll beat you up i'll beat up everyone again yeah and and with someone like
02:09:34 cn punk that would absolutely be trying to be sneaky you're trying to be cheeky you're trying to say
02:09:39 i know more about you you know what other people i got i'm an insider i've got a funny thing here
02:09:44 it's just um i i my name nat is out there a little bit some people have called me that sometimes uh
02:09:49 they're calling me guy these days which is fine but when people bring up the name keg standard
02:09:54 it's like bro you need to knock that shit off we've all moved on from those days let's just
02:09:59 let's just move it along you can only have it you can only call him mate if you spell it n eight
02:10:05 that's right and you know i a keg standard isn't even me you know that's not me that was true that
02:10:10 that is this pony man my best friend no guys that yes his own that story when you call me conrad
02:10:15 it doesn't like what you're trying to say is i know more about you than other people but what
02:10:20 in like and i'm going to rape you is implied but yeah what it comes off to me is like creepy
02:10:25 and weird because you know that my other friends online call me digi and they're i like i like it
02:10:31 when i can tell why people know me by what they call me we're like in in my house everyone calls
02:10:38 me conrad but when i hear people call me digi it lets me know oh you know me from youtube you know
02:10:45 me from my life you know if my friend fucking trevor comments on my videos and says conrad you
02:10:49 piece of shit then that's okay because it's trevor and he he's uh you know like someone who knows me
02:10:55 as conrad but like when i go to conventions and someone walks up to me and goes hey digi i can
02:11:00 go okay this guy watches my channel that's why he knows who i am you know and that makes it a lot
02:11:05 easier for me to like contextualize how people know me if you walked up to me at a convention and
02:11:10 i didn't know who you were and you said hey conrad i'm gonna assume that we went to high school
02:11:15 together or something like i'm gonna be trying to figure out why do i know you don't do that shit
02:11:19 folks it's a matter of respect that's what it is jesse you got another i think that was actually one
02:11:24 time that somebody called me by my real yeah online sometime there's only one maybe they were just
02:11:29 talking about that one luxury brand louis of dawn yes which is gives real name all right jesse
02:11:35 next one well davoo had one oh he did yeah okay blame yourself if they get mad don't think don't
02:11:40 psychoanalyze them to think that the youtuber is having a psychoanalysis yeah yeah i got that
02:11:47 string of emails for like a week from that guy who's trying to psychoanalyze me in my inbox oh yeah
02:11:52 yeah oh yeah i remember that that was amazing right because i remember that guy didn't he have a
02:11:58 really fandom as i recall yeah didn't he have a really edgy uh profile yeah he did he did it was
02:12:04 awesome that guy was just like it was like these long unbroken paragraphs that guy was a walking
02:12:09 fedora me breaks that were just that were just him going like tom the way you've left the fandom
02:12:16 proves that you you're just uh you've you've grown more distant and sensitive as a person
02:12:23 oh man that was amazing like even professional ecologists you can fire them and not let them
02:12:28 constantly right well what's your escape from these people there is nothing so so that commenter guy
02:12:33 who i was reading from before who was commenting on jesse he made another one he said your words
02:12:39 sound like those of a hurt person oh yeah i remember that one and i don't think my and get this oh
02:12:45 and i don't this is like the most egregious of this particular thing ever yeah and i don't think
02:12:51 i don't think my words are the thing that hurt you oh god shut up i think i think i think you're
02:13:02 responding to something or someone else with your bitter words i'm sorry jess and i wish you the best
02:13:08 and you know and you know after i dane after i dane to lower myself and do him the favor of
02:13:14 explaining to him in seven paragraphs why he's a fucking piece of shit he still has the nerve to
02:13:19 not even take any of it in and just reject all of it with some bullshit psycho analysis to try to
02:13:25 cop out of it and back out with his tail tucked between his legs he's a coward they're all fucking
02:13:29 cowards who don't want to accept what that is when they've made a mistake that's intellectual
02:13:32 cowardice he's looking for any excuse to not accept the argument so that's that's what that is
02:13:36 whether he can't or he just won't that's what it is and i'll okay jesse beat him up next one um
02:13:43 okay i uh i don't have any much more rules written down but i want to talk about one
02:13:47 commenter specifically from a recent episode of this podcast and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go
02:13:55 off on them but i'm gonna illustrate a couple of things we talked about so it was during the
02:14:00 dark souls race and i was making my anita sulkeesian jokes my legendary hilarious anita sulkeesian
02:14:06 jokes right the the most important character jesse's ever created yeah and and some guy was like
02:14:12 uh those jokes ruin the whole thing anita sulkeesian is not funny now i have two complaints with that
02:14:18 sentiment the first complaint is first of all motherfucker i am the expert on funny i know it's
02:14:24 funny and you don't and you can't say that something is not funny when everyone else in the call
02:14:28 on the podcast was laughing uproariously at it the whole that's right that's pretty much defeats it
02:14:33 right there but the but the second issue that i have with it is that it speaks to what we talked
02:14:37 about early earlier with misunderstanding my intent this guy thought that anita sulkeesian
02:14:44 was not funny because he was viewing the joke through the lens of well this guy's making fun of
02:14:49 anita sarkeesian and he's making fun of social justice and that's been done to death and its
02:14:53 old hat and i totally get that but it's a misunderstanding of my intent and my intent
02:14:58 is what makes the joke funny because i'm not doing it to shit on social justice warriors
02:15:01 i'm doing it because i have a fondness for anita sarkeesian i think she's hilarious it's true
02:15:07 and and and my character anita sulkeesian first of all anita sulkeesian has been my dark souls
02:15:11 character since 2011 she's been with me on these journeys the whole time i have more of an attachment
02:15:17 to her than any other character i could have possibly made so it's not just me making fun of
02:15:21 social justice warriors it's funny because she's my girl and she's just she exists in dark souls
02:15:27 she hates men she is immune to poison and is fucking funny yeah i mean that the it's got nothing
02:15:34 it's got nothing to do with me pushing any kind of agenda it's just a funny thing that i made like
02:15:38 five years ago and i stuck with it because i like her anita sulkeesian video from the blue glow
02:15:44 like if you haven't seen it it's amazing because i mean even if it was just a joke on social justice
02:15:49 warriors what is the joke the joke is that she is immune to toxic which means that you actually
02:15:56 made a character and put all of the stats into immunity so that you could run around a toxic
02:16:02 environment and it wouldn't affect you and you have gone out of your way to make this makes the
02:16:09 game harder killing all of the male in a race no less that's hilarious yeah in the middle of a race
02:16:15 he went out of his way and still beat my time by the way by a landslide yeah he he still rang
02:16:21 two bells before i rang one while taking time out of his day to murder all of the male npcs
02:16:27 and then pose proudly after doing it that shit was hilarious the fact that it's anita sulkeesian
02:16:34 is a very clever pun but the fact that it's a joke on her is not why it's funny it's a
02:16:39 fucking well-delivered joke you did it perfectly and not appreciating that just because you're
02:16:44 like you know but it's i'm sick of anita's yeah whatever dude it's funny that's why we laughed
02:16:51 at it and the guy clearly didn't think about why it was like nobody he clearly just thought it was
02:16:55 uh it's an anita nobody is more sick look at the crap nobody is more sick of that joke than me
02:16:59 but the fact that i'm so sick of it makes it even funnier to me when i do it right yeah because
02:17:07 yeah all right well well are we done have you wrapped it up i guess we've wrapped it up i could
02:17:13 go all day on this topic we could go all day but people i've got an undertale video to finish
02:17:17 it's coming what are these days i just want to say i'm just gonna end why i leave comment why
02:17:21 i like comments because i don't even get this mysterious elusive discussion that digi always
02:17:28 talks about i don't think anyone can really contribute much since i'm the one who put days
02:17:33 into thinking about it you know um i don't almost never do i watch an analysis and have
02:17:38 much else to add on to it myself i leave comments up because it helps me gauge the reaction of a
02:17:44 video i want to know not only how many people decided to watch it but how many people had a
02:17:49 some sort of verbal reaction to it right that's what i like and i just think that
02:17:53 a comment that doesn't amuse me isn't very useful if it doesn't seem like it's going to
02:17:56 amuse anyone else it does it's not worth existing you know and i'm making the world a better place
02:18:01 by deleting it yeah i'm with you there i don't i don't only leave comments open just for like good
02:18:05 discussion i like to me it it signifies that people are engaging with the content because like
02:18:12 if all i had was views and all i had was likes i don't know what kind of views those are if a
02:18:17 video gets a hundred thousand views and no comments then it's like did people even really care or
02:18:23 engage with the content or people just like what were they thinking when they watched it so like
02:18:27 the comments allow me to know that like yeah people are people give some level of a shit about what
02:18:32 i just made you know and uh and so yeah no matter what the comments are it's nice when i get a lot
02:18:39 of them and that's always a good like okay this is something that people really cared about or it
02:18:43 resonated with them you know even with something like the erased video if i didn't have so many
02:18:47 dumb comments having a bunch of negative ones at least tells me that the video was something that
02:18:54 inspired people to feel away you know like it gave them feelings whether they were positive or negative
02:19:00 but when yeah those kind of comments let you know you know what people are wanting which you could
02:19:04 throw that away if you want but at least it's information yeah it's the dirty side of it all
02:19:08 your all your bitching does have an influence on us whether we do specifically what you said or
02:19:12 not we never do specifically what you said but we at least with me i do it's a tangible detail right
02:19:18 it is it is like i'm i've been making like people don't understand specifically around what people
02:19:24 are going to misunderstand yeah a lot of people don't like they'll they'll say that they didn't
02:19:30 like the video and then they'll try to explain why and it's probably like often it's not really that
02:19:37 like they don't completely get what even like it's it's kind of like when the the film crit
02:19:42 hold tangible details thing where he talked about how people will blame the hair color of the actor
02:19:47 for the fact that the the performance wasn't good when if it's a good movie and they do a good
02:19:53 performance then you'll accept a character even if they don't look like how you thought they were
02:19:57 supposed to right like with with my videos sometimes like with the erased one i've gotten a
02:20:02 lot of complaints that just kind of missed the point of what i was trying to do and like
02:20:09 so they're not helpful they're not helpful that they're negative but constructive criticism is
02:20:13 really rare remember that right but like you know there are times where i i will just look at the
02:20:19 fact that no one got it and that can inform me now with that particular video i knew people
02:20:25 weren't going to get it and i didn't care like i wanted that video to be what it was and i knew
02:20:29 it would have a negative reaction but there have been times in the past like with my zanko no terror
02:20:33 video which is kind of similar to that one where there was a lot of negative reaction to it that
02:20:38 i didn't expect and it made me realize that i had written the video wrong not for the reasons
02:20:43 necessarily that people responded to like people would say this and that and get mad at me but what
02:20:48 i realized when i assessed like okay this video is making a lot of people mad why and then i realized
02:20:53 why and i didn't do that anymore that's why you should talk only about your own opinions don't
02:20:57 try to represent a fictional rule book because that will help us learn from your opinions
02:21:01 faster that's a very good point okay let's wrap it up but before we go i oh given you want to say
02:21:05 something yeah i was just gonna say um that uh my uh comments are uh the best by the way does
02:21:12 leave the objectively best comments of anybody as you can see on his twitter if you follow not
02:21:17 the comments that i leave i mean that's that's true but also the comments on my videos oh i see
02:21:22 because i i am the most likable guy that's true and i make the most likable videos over at
02:21:27 youtube.com slash patreon.com slash ben saint yeah your comments are like just confused most of the
02:21:34 time it seems like they're just like it's not his hypocrite i'm giving take share hypocrite
02:21:40 it doesn't offend people so long as you don't run a kickstarter you'll never get a contingent of
02:21:44 haters that's that's true okay now before we go i have one announcement i want to make which is just
02:21:50 i am officially i'm putting out a bounty on the pcp mascot because i don't know who the fuck that is
02:21:57 and it's been bothering the fuck out of me i think it might be Saito from bakuman i don't know but i'm

02:24:07 came for instead i'm tweeting hashtag repeating that's why there's no
02:24:15 weed and holes in the ceiling yeah it's quite the burden it's a hard knock life being a genius
