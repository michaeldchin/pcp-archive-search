00:00:00 I want to bless that guy, that Son ofé½£.
00:00:13 How do we start this episode?
00:00:15 It's already started, by the way.
00:00:17 But how do we start it?
00:00:19 By my book, so we can start it.
00:00:21 Yeah, okay.
00:00:22 I did, by the way.
00:00:23 I did buy the book.
00:00:25 Yes.
00:00:26 Thank you.
00:00:27 Thank you.
00:00:28 There's a Gunsmoke Volume 1 on Amazon, and what's it called?
00:00:32 On Amazon, Paperback, and eBook.
00:00:35 No, Kofi.
00:00:36 Oh, and Kofi.
00:00:37 Kofi is for people who don't need an eBook Kindle version.
00:00:42 Right.
00:00:43 Which is potentially lots of people.
00:00:48 And I get a lot more royalties through Kofi than Amazon, but of course, Kofi cannot print
00:00:54 stuff.
00:00:55 I mean, I want the physical.
00:00:57 Yeah.
00:00:58 I think the majority of orders I've got, at least the ones I can see, are physical prints.
00:01:08 I want to ask about numbers.
00:01:13 It seems a bit rude, almost.
00:01:16 No, I've got some numbers.
00:01:18 The one thing I can tell you is that it's not showing me current up to the minute numbers
00:01:26 for all the orders.
00:01:27 I don't know the process by which it decides, okay, this order has definitely gone through.
00:01:33 It's been finalized, and now we can put it on the spreadsheet.
00:01:37 But it's taking like one to two days for an order to appear.
00:01:41 So I'm getting things from yesterday this morning, and it's only a few.
00:01:47 And I know it's more actual sales have happened than are being shown to me, because of the
00:01:55 amount of people who have said they're buying one.
00:01:57 Do you not get a notification every time you sell one?
00:02:00 No, I don't know why it is.
00:02:04 I think that there's a grace period.
00:02:08 This is a conjecture.
00:02:09 I haven't actually read this from Amazon.
00:02:12 I've tried to find an explanation.
00:02:16 And there seems to be third-party software that can track it more closely.
00:02:21 But it seems to be like the reason is there's a grace period for if somebody wants to refund
00:02:26 it before it actually gets shipped out.
00:02:28 So they don't want to give me the information until the money has actually been finally transferred
00:02:36 and cannot be refunded.
00:02:38 I guess that makes sense.
00:02:41 Yeah, so I don't have a cool number or a cool graph to look at.
00:02:45 I think I'll look into third-party stuff just so I can look at the number go up, because
00:02:50 I am excited about that.
00:02:55 So far, it has counted eight orders, and I know there's more than that, but eight, six
00:03:02 physical prints from United States, one from here at UK, and a Kindle version that my
00:03:09 mom bought to try it out on her iPad, which was useful, because I didn't know what it
00:03:17 looked like on a phone or an iPad through the Kindle.
00:03:20 It looks great.
00:03:21 I'm sure there's more people listening that want a copy of Clarissa Gunsmoke Volume 1.
00:03:29 Yes, I didn't really really talk about what it is.
00:03:33 Get those orders in, folks.
00:03:36 It's the first volume of my comic Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Bandit King, which contains
00:03:43 the three currently out chapters, plus the unreleased currently, as of recording unreleased
00:03:50 fourth chapter, the fourth one.
00:03:55 The fourth one.
00:03:56 The fourth one.
00:03:57 The fourth one.
00:03:58 Hey, may the fourth be with you.
00:04:01 It's March.
00:04:04 It's March the fourth.
00:04:05 Pardon me.
00:04:06 Excuse me.
00:04:07 Yeah.
00:04:08 Cinco de Marcho.
00:04:09 Cinco de Marcho.
00:04:10 You said you were, I was amazed when you told me the profit margins.
00:04:20 You said, you told me it was like $7.
00:04:22 You make like $7.
00:04:23 That's like almost half.
00:04:24 Yes.
00:04:25 And that's like on a $15 book sale, like that's, I would expect, my expenses for printing
00:04:32 a book like this would be at least, I would probably, including like printing the book,
00:04:38 getting it shipped to me and then mailing it, even inside the US, I would expect that
00:04:43 all to cost me at least $10 maybe more, which would leave me with only like $5 or less in
00:04:49 profit.
00:04:50 Yeah.
00:04:51 And on like foreign, on like international shipment, forget about it.
00:04:54 Shipping would be $20.
00:04:55 Yeah.
00:04:56 It's a whole big fuck.
00:04:58 Yeah.
00:04:59 Yeah.
00:05:00 I have for ebook.
00:05:04 It just makes me so jealous.
00:05:05 I just want Amazon, I just want Amazon's infrastructure.
00:05:08 I just want to have access to the fucking means by which they ship things so cheaply.
00:05:13 Why do they get to do it and I have to freaking go to the post office and pay $25 to send
00:05:19 six ounces of packaging to the UK?
00:05:22 It's evil.
00:05:23 Because they bundle up their packages and then they have it like lashed together with
00:05:27 rope and then they have a slave driver and he's does his whip thing and it's like in
00:05:33 the pyramids of Giza, they roll the packages on logs into the post office.
00:05:37 Why didn't I get a slave?
00:05:40 I don't know.
00:05:41 They got slaves.
00:05:42 You should have worked harder than you would have done.
00:05:43 Maybe I should have pulled myself up by my bootstraps if I wanted a slave.
00:05:47 They ship them in the big metal containers like the ones in the dock and in Disco Elysium.
00:05:56 The one that freaking Everard has his office in.
00:06:01 Yeah.
00:06:02 Yeah.
00:06:03 One of those.
00:06:04 But yeah, the royalties.
00:06:05 The royalties are a little interesting.
00:06:07 For paperback, quite simple, there's 60% royalty minus printing fees and for printing
00:06:13 this book, it's like two bucks.
00:06:16 Yeah.
00:06:17 Really?
00:06:18 So how many pages is it?
00:06:20 74 pages.
00:06:22 That's really cheap.
00:06:23 That's really cheap printing.
00:06:24 That's cheap as fuck and that is because it's like non-color.
00:06:29 I think if it was a color book, it'd be a little bit more expensive, but not prohibitively.
00:06:33 I think I'd look to the tables, it'd be like three to five dollars depending on how many
00:06:38 pages and if it was hardback and stuff like that.
00:06:44 When you...
00:06:45 Okay.
00:06:46 I mean, so the buyer doesn't have to pay for shipping because I bought one and it went
00:06:53 into my...
00:06:54 I assume if you have Prime, you get free shipping, you get on everything if you have Prime.
00:06:57 I don't have Prime, so I usually have to...
00:07:00 As long as I buy more than $25 worth of stuff on Amazon at a time, I get free shipping on
00:07:05 most things.
00:07:06 So I put it in my cart and I got free shipping on it because I added $10 worth of other stuff.
00:07:12 So I effectively paid nothing for shipping.
00:07:14 Yeah, it's great.
00:07:16 So...
00:07:17 Wait a minute.
00:07:18 It's finally a way I can send merchandise of my artwork out into the world without it
00:07:24 being too expensive for people to say, oh, I don't know about that.
00:07:28 I actually can't believe this because like $2 for...
00:07:35 I mean, I assume it's because the pages are black and white.
00:07:39 So I assume that that would cost more if it were in color.
00:07:43 But for $2, I mean, I would pay more than that to print, for example, a copy of the
00:07:50 Radcon Paradise Dojin, which is only 32 pages, black and white, cost more than $3 per copy
00:07:59 to print.
00:08:02 So that's...
00:08:03 It's almost...
00:08:04 Oh, God, I'm going to make myself sick if this is true, but it would be almost cheaper
00:08:09 to simply buy print-on-demand copies one at a time in bulk from Amazon and ship them
00:08:17 to myself than it is to buy a bulk order from Kaplan.
00:08:21 No, that can't be true.
00:08:24 Oh, you haven't even heard the best part.
00:08:28 Well, it's not the best part, but a cool thing about that is I, as an author, as the
00:08:32 author of this book, I can request Amazon send me a bulk order physical that I can then
00:08:38 sell by myself in person.
00:08:40 So if I want to go to a convention, I can pay just the price of printing, not like the
00:08:47 actual cost of the thing, send it to me, and then I can have like 100 Clarissa Gunsmokes
00:08:51 printed by Amazon at that price.
00:08:54 Do you get a discount or same price?
00:08:56 I think it might be a discount and check, because I didn't need that.
00:09:00 Because if there's additional discounts for printing in bulk, then that's just gravy.
00:09:04 Yes.
00:09:05 It's already cheap.
00:09:06 I would imagine there might be, but didn't check that exactly.
00:09:10 But that's cool, because if I ever need, like, oh, I'm going to maybe see if I can get a
00:09:15 table at a convention, I need a bunch of my book.
00:09:18 Yeah.
00:09:19 Amazon can just send it to me.
00:09:20 Yeah.
00:09:21 It's great.
00:09:22 Wow.
00:09:23 And you can have it, too.
00:09:24 It ships everywhere in the world, everywhere.
00:09:28 Can I, the consumer, order 100 copies and get a bulk discount?
00:09:35 No, I don't think so.
00:09:37 I guess you can get a shipping discount.
00:09:39 Nice.
00:09:40 If you buy two enough things.
00:09:41 Hell yeah.
00:09:44 But yeah, I'm going to have to look into this.
00:09:48 Damn it.
00:09:49 I was hoping I wouldn't have to look into this, but I guess I do.
00:09:53 It's so good.
00:09:54 Okay, so there's 60% royalty for paperback, but they have an extra thing that I checked.
00:10:00 So in addition to that, expanded distribution networks, so like Amazon can have the book
00:10:08 listed for schools and libraries and bookstores to purchase and put in their store.
00:10:16 And I get a 40% royalty on that.
00:10:17 So if Barden's a noble, know that Clarissa Gunsmoke's hot shit and they want it in their
00:10:23 store all over the world, all over the country, I guess, they can order it from Amazon.
00:10:29 And I get money through that.
00:10:31 So it's even less work I have to do for, not likely to happen because Clarissa Gunsmoke
00:10:36 is like a complete nobody right now, but that's cool.
00:10:42 If that were to happen, if you were to get copies ordered for libraries or bookstores
00:10:46 or anything, I mean, I would want to know about that.
00:10:48 That would be awesome.
00:10:50 I guess I understand how that Amazon could offer that as a possibility, but I'm sure
00:10:58 you have to promote it yourself, like they're not going to promote it for you.
00:11:02 No, well, they don't promote it.
00:11:04 The marketing is all on my end.
00:11:06 But they put it in a catalog or something.
00:11:09 They put it in a catalog and it can be listed.
00:11:11 So like if a librarian is just scrolling through and I see Clarissa Gunsmoke and they're like,
00:11:15 ah, that looks like something we need in the library.
00:11:17 So just download a copy.
00:11:19 I mean, yeah, order a copy or three.
00:11:22 You wouldn't download a copy of Clarissa Gunsmoke.
00:11:25 Oh, wait, yes, you would from Kofi.
00:11:27 Yes, you would from Kofi, where I get that only takes 5% of the sale for a Kofi store,
00:11:35 Kofi store.
00:11:37 I looked at Gumroad, by the way, Gumroad takes 10%.
00:11:40 So like Kofi is just better.
00:11:42 I didn't actually know you could sell stuff through Kofi.
00:11:46 It might be relatively new, but yeah, it's quite easy.
00:11:50 You just take 5% of every sale.
00:11:52 And if you're like a special member of Kofi, it's like you get 100% of the sale goes to you.
00:12:01 Are you a special member?
00:12:03 No, I'm a free user.
00:12:04 But 5% is so low, that's great.
00:12:07 Yeah, I made a Kofi for the PCP, sort of as like a secondary support alternative to Patreon,
00:12:18 the idea that we would advertise it in the perfect comic party.
00:12:22 You know, I think it's Kofi.com slash the PCP.
00:12:27 I think that's the URL.
00:12:29 Wait, what's your Kofi?
00:12:31 Oh, yes, my Kofi is Kofi.com slash Gibbentake, same as everywhere else.
00:12:37 Right, right, right.
00:12:41 Oh, and Amazon, Amazon has given me, let me check, because it was a little glitchy, but
00:12:51 like if I search Clarissa Gunsmoke,
00:12:56 and it comes up, Hell yeah, it comes up, that's so fucking cool.
00:13:00 And then I click my name.
00:13:05 It's my name.
00:13:06 Oh, it doesn't work.
00:13:07 It doesn't work in the UK.
00:13:08 I think in the US, I have like an author page in US, Amazon.
00:13:13 So if I switch to, switch the fucking,
00:13:19 oh, whatever.
00:13:20 But I have an author page, so I can put like a profile picture and say, oh, I'm an author.
00:13:25 This is about me.
00:13:27 Hmm.
00:13:27 Learn more about Louie Batten.
00:13:30 That's my full name.
00:13:32 I was not sure whether I was going to do my full name or an internet pseudonym.
00:13:37 I saw you put it as Ms. Louie Batten.
00:13:39 Yes.
00:13:40 Ms is such a funny, such a funny, such a hype, such a specific use case for an abbreviation, Ms.
00:13:49 But yeah, I think just because it maybe seems more professional and more like legitimate to have
00:14:00 a person's name and everyone does it.
00:14:03 Everyone does it.
00:14:05 So it's like, I don't know, if on the off-chance that Enormy is learning about my comic,
00:14:11 they won't be slightly put off by Gibb and take internet name.
00:14:16 Right.
00:14:17 Yeah.
00:14:18 Maybe.
00:14:18 They'll think of it as, oh, it's a glorific novel.
00:14:21 Who made Scott Pilgrim?
00:14:25 It's not like whatever username.
00:14:29 Not Radio Maru.
00:14:30 Yeah.
00:14:31 It was Brian Lee O'Malley.
00:14:33 You see.
00:14:34 All right.
00:14:35 That was his Tumblr handle.
00:14:38 Lol.
00:14:38 Yeah.
00:14:40 So yeah, I'm jazzed.
00:14:42 I was very-
00:14:43 Pretty jazz worthy.
00:14:44 I was very frustrated last week.
00:14:50 It was difficult to get everything working.
00:14:53 I bought a paperback for myself and it looks great.
00:14:59 And there's no problems anymore.
00:15:01 I can't wait to see mine.
00:15:04 Oh, it's so good.
00:15:05 It's like, what if you made something?
00:15:07 You, what if you drew something on a computer screen and then you have it in your hand?
00:15:10 No way.
00:15:15 Shit.
00:15:17 I think I'm going to have it on Friday.
00:15:18 I think mine's arriving on Friday.
00:15:20 So it'll be the day this goes up.
00:15:23 I'll have it hopefully, maybe even sooner.
00:15:27 This is the beginning of my girl boss CEO arc.
00:15:33 I'm starting it.
00:15:33 I'm starting an industry.
00:15:34 I'm starting an empire.
00:15:36 It'll be Clarissa Gunsmoke to start.
00:15:38 And then I'm going to put, I think I might,
00:15:42 the next thing I put on Amazon will be the Belle Jape book.
00:15:46 And that'll be like, you can get a paperback or a hardback,
00:15:49 because that's going to be like hundreds of pages, I think.
00:15:51 Do you have that made or do you?
00:15:54 It's half made.
00:15:55 It's like started.
00:15:56 I started it back a while before even the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.
00:16:04 Because like, you know, I love those home stuck and problem sleuth books
00:16:08 with the little commentary at the bottom.
00:16:09 What if I did that?
00:16:11 With my silly little thing.
00:16:12 Yeah.
00:16:13 So I have the beginnings of something.
00:16:16 But yeah, translating it takes a long time with all the gifts
00:16:21 and posting multiple versions of, you know, the different frames
00:16:26 and completely different experience.
00:16:28 Well, now I have two potential segues into topics of conversation.
00:16:33 I could go, I could branch off of, oh, translating something
00:16:38 from digital onto a page, or I could go like print on demand
00:16:44 versus like backlog print runs.
00:16:51 Do the second one.
00:16:52 Okay.
00:16:55 So I have changed the, I ordered the PCP Radcon Paradise Dojin.
00:17:02 I ordered, I think I ordered like, I only ordered like 30 copies,
00:17:07 because like I wanted to give copies to all the artists and to the writers.
00:17:11 And I only got a, I only got a handful of other orders,
00:17:13 but like it's not that hard for me to order more.
00:17:15 If like, I get, if I get like 20 more orders tomorrow when I run out,
00:17:17 I could just order like a dozen more copies.
00:17:19 And it, it, it costs me like 10 extra dollars in shipping.
00:17:22 It's not that big a deal to just, to just get like a few more.
00:17:26 So I ordered a bunch of those and I have offered on St.
00:17:29 Comics store page.
00:17:31 I have offered, I've, I've offering a combo.
00:17:34 I call it the Rad combo.
00:17:37 It's for the, the, the, the Rad, the Dojin and the Road to Radcon for like,
00:17:43 I think it's like eight or nine dollars off the whole thing.
00:17:45 If you buy both as a combo.
00:17:46 And the reason I did that is cause I have like 30,
00:17:48 I have like 30 leftover copies of Road to Radcon.
00:17:51 And I really just like to get rid of them.
00:17:53 I don't need, I don't need 30 copies of that in a box.
00:17:57 Please buy my Rad combo.
00:17:59 It's, it's, it's a combo deal.
00:18:01 Super size it.
00:18:03 Road to Radcon is good.
00:18:04 You shouldn't, it actually, it actually is pretty
00:18:07 funny. If you, if, if, just a reminder, if you haven't read it,
00:18:09 you can read it for free on the new PCP website at theprocrastinatorspodcast.com
00:18:14 slash stuff.html.
00:18:17 It is pretty funny.
00:18:19 And the cover art by Michi is gorgeous and it's a nice little novella.
00:18:23 Yeah, a little doodles on the inside.
00:18:26 The doodles on the inside are nice.
00:18:28 The cover is a, is a, is a real masterpiece.
00:18:31 But I don't need 30 of them.
00:18:32 Please buy them.
00:18:33 Yeah, that's another great thing.
00:18:38 Don't have to do any shipping at all.
00:18:40 Amazon will do.
00:18:41 Yeah, that's, that's.
00:18:44 International shipping is so expensive.
00:18:46 I never have to have a bunch of crap, a bunch of stuff in my room.
00:18:48 It's, it, I feel so clean.
00:18:50 I feel so cool.
00:18:51 Having, and having to go, having to go to the post office is such a,
00:18:56 such a freaking, such a freaking drag.
00:18:58 I hate, I hate that shit.
00:18:59 Oh, I gotta, my PO box is about to expire.
00:19:02 I have to like renew my PO box soon.
00:19:07 The other thing.
00:19:08 Okay, I want to say it.
00:19:09 On the store page, the plebenweed blu-rays.
00:19:12 I think I might have mentioned this last week,
00:19:13 but I'm going to be discontinuing them.
00:19:15 I'm not going to be making any more
00:19:17 because it's not worth it to make more.
00:19:20 So the, the lat, those will be, those will be coming down
00:19:24 probably sometime in the next week.
00:19:27 After the, after this episode goes live.
00:19:32 There's simply, there's simply not enough demand to, to justify
00:19:36 continuing to order the stuff I need.
00:19:38 Don't want to buy any more DVD boxes or anything like that.
00:19:41 So what I got is going to be the last, the last of it that I make.
00:19:45 And then, you know, sorry if you miss out,
00:19:49 but like you should have, you should have bought it earlier, guys.
00:19:55 So I don't know, jump on that if you want.
00:19:58 Uh, there's no blu-ray for Clarissa Gunsmoke yet.
00:20:02 We should put, we should put the rad content on the blu-ray.
00:20:05 We should, we should put the garling house lecture
00:20:08 and the garling house diss track.
00:20:11 And we should put all that on, on its own blu-ray.
00:20:13 Everything should, everything should be on blu-ray.
00:20:15 Everything should be, you know, the OVA, everything should be on blu-ray.
00:20:18 I don't put blu-ray discs in my blu-ray player.
00:20:21 Physical media only.
00:20:23 I mean, I don't even, I like physical comics
00:20:26 because you can pick it up off the shelf
00:20:28 and you're already reading it.
00:20:29 Yeah. A DVD, you've got to like put it in your freaking machine.
00:20:33 A DVD, you need one, all of the material,
00:20:36 all of the technology required to make it work
00:20:38 to be currently functioning and the disc itself to be undamaged.
00:20:45 And then even then after that, it's like, I don't know, it's fine.
00:20:50 StComics.
00:20:51 Try to watch a YouTube video again.
00:20:53 StComics.com slash store.html for that while supplies last.
00:20:59 Time is, time is running out.
00:21:00 You will be gone soon, no longer available.
00:21:06 Or here's the thing I forgot to say.
00:21:08 Oh, sure.
00:21:08 So royalties, the ebook on Kindle, the royalty is odd.
00:21:14 There's two versions I could have chosen.
00:21:16 One of them is like 30% royalties.
00:21:19 And I don't know why it's like so low.
00:21:22 But the other one is 70%.
00:21:24 But they reduce the money you get for the size of the file of like the ebook.
00:21:33 So if you've got a big ebook, the megabytes weigh it down and you get less money.
00:21:39 Really?
00:21:40 Yes. I think it's just like people don't want huge files on their Kindle.
00:21:45 Just to incentivize like lower.
00:21:48 Yeah, compress compression and like, I mean, usually you would have text,
00:21:53 so it'd be small anyway.
00:21:54 So if you're doing a print book or a color, like a book with images,
00:22:02 you want to compress that as much as you can without it being shitty looking.
00:22:07 Is there like a threshold and like as long as you're under this threshold,
00:22:10 the royalties are better?
00:22:14 No, no, I think.
00:22:16 Well, I chose 70% because like, I still get more money that way,
00:22:20 even with the size of my ebook.
00:22:23 As opposed to the 30% of the sale, which is just flat and the megabytes doesn't get involved.
00:22:32 I mean, yeah, 70% is better than 30%.
00:22:36 But how did you qualify for that?
00:22:38 What did you have to do?
00:22:40 What do you mean qualify?
00:22:41 Well, you said.
00:22:42 Well, you said, I mean, the choice between 70% and 30% seems like a no brainer.
00:22:49 So like, what's the catch?
00:22:51 Well, the catch is that if you have a big file size,
00:22:54 I think there's something else for the 30% that I didn't really understand when I read it.
00:23:00 It's something, something, something, I'll have to go back and check.
00:23:05 But it's some technical thing that is like maybe good.
00:23:09 But like, I just want more money.
00:23:11 I don't give a shit.
00:23:12 Maybe it would like convert it into different types of Kindle things
00:23:16 and more people could read it on different places.
00:23:18 Well, I don't, well, I don't use, I don't use a Kindle or like ebooks or anything.
00:23:24 So I don't know how any of that works.
00:23:26 But sure, I do understand why they would want low file sizes.
00:23:31 Definitely.
00:23:32 Yeah, but I still get like from this, the 999 ebook on with that stuff,
00:23:40 minus the file size is $3.11, obviously, that's not bad.
00:23:45 Obviously we'll put a link in the description to where you can purchase Clarissa Gunsmoke
00:23:49 volume one.
00:23:51 Oh, speaking of links with, I put the link on my website.
00:23:55 I have a little button underneath Clarissa Gunsmoke that says buy like a paperback or buy digital.
00:24:01 They're links to the different stores.
00:24:04 But the Amazon one goes to theamericanamazon.com instead of .couk or like .de or whatever.
00:24:14 And it doesn't automatically adjust.
00:24:15 I think there is a way to have a link to Amazon automatically adjust to your region.
00:24:21 Because if I click on that, it goes to amazon.com and then it says it doesn't ship to me.
00:24:26 But if I switch regions, it will say that.
00:24:30 So I've got to update that.
00:24:31 I've got to find that link and I'll send that link and that should be the link under the description.
00:24:36 But if you search Clarissa Gunsmoke on Amazon, you will find it.
00:24:39 And it'll be in your region if you do it like that.
00:24:43 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:45 So it's all good.
00:24:45 But it should ship to everywhere.
00:24:49 Yes, anywhere that Amazon has a website version, which is many countries in the place in the world.
00:24:59 You've gone global.
00:25:01 I'm global.
00:25:02 I'm a global published author.
00:25:05 I was reading.
00:25:06 Oh, you know who sent me an interesting document?
00:25:09 It was those guys from the Cato anthology.
00:25:13 Remember them?
00:25:14 We had them on when they published.
00:25:17 They kickstarted their anthology comic.
00:25:21 Hoodie from Cato sent me their document, which was it was because they had heard us talking
00:25:29 about copyright stuff for the perfect comic party.
00:25:34 And they sent me their agreement for inclusion in their stuff.
00:25:39 And I read through their document and it was interesting.
00:25:40 And then I looked up a bunch of terms that were in it and I was googling around,
00:25:45 trying to learn more about copyright stuff.
00:25:47 And I found out there's a lot to it.
00:25:55 You can sell the rights to all different kinds of things with your work.
00:26:02 When you publish something, you can sell someone the right to be the first to publish.
00:26:08 You can sell someone the right to be the first to publish in a given country,
00:26:12 which means you can sell the same rights to another country.
00:26:15 You can give someone the rights to be the first to publish in a certain language,
00:26:19 which means you can then do it in a translated language with some other publisher,
00:26:23 and you can sell those rights to them.
00:26:27 The right to be the first to publish is its own thing.
00:26:30 Sometimes it comes along with a stipulation that you will not publish elsewhere for a certain
00:26:35 period of time.
00:26:36 There's archival rights, which are ongoing rights in perpetuity to host and publish
00:26:45 the digital rights.
00:26:46 The electronic rights are separate from both from all kinds of printing rights.
00:26:51 So I don't know, it was pretty complicated.
00:26:54 And I came away thinking, I think what we got to do is just worry about the digital version
00:26:59 for now.
00:27:01 And I think the agreement should just give us permission to publish and archive
00:27:10 your submission electronically.
00:27:13 We will host it for free, and you will give it to us for free, and we will host it for free.
00:27:19 And that's the agreement.
00:27:20 And there's nothing else to it until, if we ever want to print in the future,
00:27:24 we'll contact you and we'll work something out for that.
00:27:29 I see.
00:27:29 I think that's probably how we should move forward
00:27:33 with the digital PDF version.
00:27:37 There's lots of different publishers.
00:27:39 So what's hypothetically, if we wanted to do printing, what's the complications?
00:27:51 Well, it's basically a separate agreement.
00:27:54 I was kind of hoping that we could have it all ironed out.
00:27:58 If someone submits their comic, they are giving us the right to publish it in whatever form we
00:28:06 want, and maybe there would be certain monetary compensation involved.
00:28:10 If we decide to take it to print and print it as an anthology, maybe we would have already
00:28:15 agreed to compensate them a certain amount ahead of time.
00:28:19 I would like to have gotten all the agreements out of the way upon submission,
00:28:23 and there's no more need to worry about it.
00:28:25 I think that that was a pipe dream.
00:28:28 I think it's too complicated for that to be possible.
00:28:33 Is it like, it sounds like a weird, bad, sneaky contract thing, but what if we want to contact
00:28:45 you about, we're going to try and print it, but certain people just never get back to us?
00:28:51 Yeah, that's what I was worried about.
00:28:54 Do we have to put in a thing saying, if you do not get back to us upon our initial thing,
00:29:02 but within a certain amount of time, then we're just allowed to do it?
00:29:07 I feel like that's a little bit of a sneaky small print thing.
00:29:12 Yeah, I think, I was worried about that too.
00:29:19 It's like, well, once we have it in the publication, what if we then can't get them
00:29:22 on board, or we can't contact them again, or they disappear, and we want to publish
00:29:26 their stuff in a print anthology?
00:29:29 Maybe just leave them out of the printed version?
00:29:34 My gut says, okay, it's probably putting the card before the horse to be worrying
00:29:40 about print rights when we're not even thinking about printing anything yet,
00:29:43 when we're just worried about a digital publication.
00:29:48 Maybe we need to worry about the digital and electronic archival rights right now.
00:29:52 And yeah, I think it's just going to be probably if we want to print and we reach out
00:29:58 to the author and we say, hey, let's license us to print your stuff and sell your stuff
00:30:03 as part of an anthology, and they don't answer us.
00:30:05 I think we're just going to have to be like, well, we can't do it, which would suck.
00:30:14 But I mean, I don't know if there's anything else for it.
00:30:23 I guess. I mean, for any individual person who has a comic,
00:30:33 I would assume they would want the ability to do print their own thing, archive their own thing
00:30:43 in addition to whatever the perfect comic party will be.
00:30:47 So I guess the perfect comic party being unprintable is not a terrible tragedy in my eyes,
00:30:57 as long as, I mean, I'm going to be printing my comments.
00:31:00 I'm not saying it's unprintable.
00:31:03 I'm just saying.
00:31:03 Well, it would be difficult.
00:31:05 Well, I'm just saying we wouldn't.
00:31:06 But certain issues would be unprintable if we just can't get the person.
00:31:09 Well.
00:31:10 Or if it's people don't agree.
00:31:12 Well, yes, true.
00:31:15 But I think that's not too big of a problem, because I'm still going to be able to print
00:31:21 my comic.
00:31:22 It's not going to prevent other people from printing the comics on their own terms.
00:31:27 Yeah.
00:31:27 Yeah.
00:31:28 The collective will not be able to be printed.
00:31:33 I'm not interested.
00:31:35 I'm not interested in stipulating anything for submissions that are like,
00:31:39 if you submit, you agree you will not publish this in any other.
00:31:43 Oh, no, no.
00:31:44 That's not what I mean.
00:31:45 Yeah.
00:31:45 Yeah.
00:31:46 Yeah.
00:31:46 Of course.
00:31:47 I mean, if I was going to stipulate that, I would expect that we would be paying money.
00:31:52 And I don't want to pay anyone money.
00:31:54 We're doing this free.
00:31:56 Unless if we're not selling the book, then I feel like it's OK to ask people to submit for free.
00:32:04 But I wouldn't feel that way if we were like, well, if you give it to us,
00:32:07 then you can't publish anywhere else.
00:32:09 No, of course not.
00:32:10 That would never be part of the thing.
00:32:13 Because I mean, the idea of having a printed version of the perfect comic party is just like,
00:32:18 oh, that'd be nice.
00:32:19 Would that be nice?
00:32:20 Well, it's nice.
00:32:21 That's about as far as it goes.
00:32:23 Well, no.
00:32:24 No, you idiot.
00:32:25 It's not just nice.
00:32:27 It's about staying in the black.
00:32:29 It's about the dollar-dollar bills.
00:32:32 It's about stacking Benjamins.
00:32:34 It's about.
00:32:35 Then if that's the case, the contract needs to be a little more like it can handle that.
00:32:45 I just think potentially print copies are an avenue to turn this venture into
00:32:54 something that generates revenue.
00:32:56 But for that, yeah, we would need additional agreements with submittees.
00:33:08 But since the idea then would be that we're selling it, I feel like I don't think it would
00:33:16 be sustainable to expect people to submit their stuff for free for us to then sell.
00:33:24 We would have to draft up some standard licensing contract, but then in the here and now,
00:33:32 we would be paying people money for content that we would then be publishing for free.
00:33:42 We'd have to operate at a loss in preparation for potential future revenues.
00:33:48 Oh, so you would pay them like a flat fee when they submit it?
00:33:55 For example, yeah, for example.
00:33:57 And not when it gets sold?
00:33:59 Well, we could stipulate something like future compensation before print.
00:34:08 Yeah, I mean, we could do it in like a, we promise to pay you a certain amount
00:34:13 at such time as we make them available for physical sale, that seems reasonable.
00:34:21 Okay, you know what, you know what, Gib, that's not bad.
00:34:25 That's not bad because I would rather promise to pay someone in the future than pay them now.
00:34:33 Yes, the only thing is then when we're like, okay, let's print.
00:34:39 Oh, we've got to pay this many people this much money.
00:34:42 Oh, we can't afford that law.
00:34:44 Well, sure.
00:34:44 In which case, maybe we do pre-orders of the physical version.
00:34:50 It's a whole bunch of crunch.
00:34:52 It is a whole bunch of crunch.
00:34:54 I couldn't have said it better myself.
00:34:59 I hope this isn't, you know, I started talking about this stuff on my stream the other day
00:35:03 and my viewership like cratered.
00:35:06 So I hope this isn't boring, but I mean, I think it's really interesting.
00:35:10 I think it's a fascinating puzzle to try and solve this,
00:35:16 put these pieces together in a way that forms a money-making machine.
00:35:21 For me, it's like the curse cloud from Okami.
00:35:26 Every moment I stand in there, my health bubbles are going a little smaller.
00:35:33 I got to jump out of there and run around in the dirt.
00:35:35 No, I'm in there.
00:35:36 I'm in the cloud.
00:35:37 I am the cloud.
00:35:38 I am the cloud, baby.
00:35:44 Okay, okay, okay.
00:35:47 You know what?
00:35:48 I like that idea.
00:35:48 So let's just let's explore it.
00:35:50 Let's explore it for another minute or two.
00:35:53 When, if we stipulated some of the...
00:35:56 Okay, you submit, you give us the rights to electronically publish for free
00:36:03 and we will make it available for free.
00:36:09 However, you also agree, you agree to not necessarily first publishing rights,
00:36:17 but you agree to allow us, you know, print rights.
00:36:22 Okay, I feel like we might have to stipulate some kind of time frame.
00:36:26 Like, I feel like it might not be okay to just be like,
00:36:31 say that and be like, at some point in the future, like maybe 50 years from now,
00:36:35 we just said, oh, well, we still got the rights.
00:36:38 Maybe we can.
00:36:39 I mean, if it's not an exclusive deal, maybe we can just be like, yeah,
00:36:43 we're allowed to do it.
00:36:45 There's no exclusivity deal, but we're allowed to do it.
00:36:47 Okay, okay.
00:36:48 So maybe we say, it's free electronically.
00:36:52 At such time that we make it available for publishing,
00:36:54 you will be entitled to some amount and we could do it some flat amount per submission
00:36:59 or we could do it, we could do it like per page.
00:37:01 We could do it on a per page basis as well.
00:37:04 Oh, but that means verbose people get the big cash.
00:37:09 Yeah, that would, that would draw really small.
00:37:12 That would perversely incentivize you to like stretch your content out over as many pages as
00:37:21 possible, which is, I mean, other publications have operated on such a business model in the
00:37:27 past.
00:37:27 It's not untenable.
00:37:28 But yeah, is it, is it incentivizing the kind of creator behavior that we want?
00:37:34 Maybe not.
00:37:35 Maybe not.
00:37:39 I mean, I think most people submitting are just going to do it because there's like, oh, cool.
00:37:43 Maybe my comic will be seen.
00:37:45 Maybe this isn't a good excuse to start drawing my comic.
00:37:48 You're absolutely right, Gib.
00:37:49 We should pay an exposure.
00:37:51 Yeah.
00:37:54 We own the means of production.
00:37:56 They have to give us a website.
00:37:58 A website to host what files on.
00:38:00 They give us some, some, some dirt on themselves.
00:38:04 And we expose the dirt if they don't comply.
00:38:07 That's the paid in exposure.
00:38:11 You have to tell us one.
00:38:13 You have to one.
00:38:13 Cancelable secret.
00:38:14 One dirty little secret.
00:38:16 All right.
00:38:16 You can submit your comic, but we will only accept submissions if you record yourself
00:38:21 saying the n-word and you submit a pen.
00:38:23 We will, we will release it if you break your contract.
00:38:26 This is part of the standard agreement.
00:38:30 Standard agreement.
00:38:30 This is standard industry procedure.
00:38:33 This is how, this is how the world works now.
00:38:36 It's all about that cancelable currency.
00:38:40 Cancel coins.
00:38:41 That's right.
00:38:43 Cash your cancel coins.
00:38:44 Get this person off the line.
00:38:46 Off line.
00:38:47 Get him, get him hiding.
00:38:49 It's, it's a, it's a, it's a trust based economy.
00:38:52 There's nothing more valuable than the ability to destroy some of credibility.
00:38:56 Based economy.
00:38:58 Oh, right.
00:38:59 Liz, that cutie.
00:39:04 Okay.
00:39:05 Okay.
00:39:07 I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
00:39:09 I'm stinking.
00:39:11 What do, what do we offer?
00:39:13 I don't know.
00:39:14 What, what's a reasonable amount to offer in such an agreement?
00:39:17 Like you give us, we will pay you 50 bucks.
00:39:22 That seems low.
00:39:25 Do I get 50 bucks?
00:39:26 Will we, will we pay ourselves 50 bucks to put our own comics in our own?
00:39:33 No.
00:39:34 No.
00:39:35 I mean.
00:39:38 Why would I even be a part of this?
00:39:39 Why would I be doing all that?
00:39:41 I'll just sell my own comics.
00:39:43 I'll give myself 50 bucks every day.
00:39:45 I, okay.
00:39:47 Look, here's, I, there's, I feel like there's going to be submissions.
00:39:54 Some, some, we, here's, here's what we get in particular.
00:39:57 Some submissions are going to be worth more than others.
00:40:00 Like some will be more substantial, more professional, you know.
00:40:06 So, so I, a, a, a, a one, a one size fits all standard, you know, contract remuneration
00:40:14 amount seems a little weird.
00:40:17 Well, that's why we have like a, we, we decide who gets in.
00:40:21 Sure.
00:40:22 I mean, yeah, that, that does kind of.
00:40:24 That's sort of how it works in general.
00:40:25 But what if they're all bad?
00:40:27 But what if they're all bad?
00:40:28 Like the idea in show and jump is, or yeah, any comic, the show and jump has multiple
00:40:34 different, I guess Marvel does, but they sell individual, whatever.
00:40:38 Right.
00:40:38 The idea is that they have an artist say, can I please have this marketplace?
00:40:46 Can I please have eyes on my art?
00:40:47 Platform, please.
00:40:48 Platform, please.
00:40:49 And, and show and jump is got a big platform.
00:40:53 So it's, it's attractive to artists.
00:40:56 It could be a career maker to get on there.
00:41:01 Perfect comic party is not that.
00:41:03 That's certainly not at the beginning.
00:41:05 No.
00:41:05 So there's no incentive other than wouldn't it be nice?
00:41:08 I mean, there is a little bit of incentive because there's.
00:41:11 We have a very, we have a, we have a tiny little, we have a little, we have a tiny little.
00:41:14 We have a tiny little.
00:41:15 We have a little platform.
00:41:20 Yeah.
00:41:20 It's one of those platforms that if you stand on it, it'll fall into lava.
00:41:25 Yeah.
00:41:25 It starts to shake.
00:41:27 It starts shaking a little bit and you got like one second.
00:41:31 Yeah.
00:41:31 So my screen, my screen just turned off.
00:41:33 Okay.
00:41:33 I'm back.
00:41:36 I forgot where I was going with that.
00:41:38 But show and jump says, we need you to keep our reputation high.
00:41:44 So you can't suck.
00:41:45 So you have to be very good.
00:41:46 And all the artists, they say, okay, try their best.
00:41:50 Here's, I think that in concept, the idea of free for now, we might print later,
00:41:57 but we'll pay you if we do.
00:41:59 I think that's a sound idea.
00:42:02 It's a sound basis for an idea, but you have to look into how to actually draw that out.
00:42:07 It's a, it's a sound basis for an idea.
00:42:10 And just the balancing act there is like, what's the, what's the amount that is,
00:42:16 that like incentivizes quality submissions and doesn't like bankrupt us to offer it as like a
00:42:25 standard submission, you know, accepted submission contract and isn't like insulting
00:42:34 to people that made like real comics.
00:42:37 And I like, and I like, for us, for us to, for us to like print them.
00:42:42 Also, I don't know, I feel like if we print, there might be, I mean, I, you know,
00:42:52 I would like the ability to print in perpetuity.
00:42:57 And if it's not exclusive, I feel like that would not necessarily be unreasonable.
00:43:02 Yeah.
00:43:02 But also that seems, it seems like that would be expensive.
00:43:05 I don't know. It seems like maybe it'd be more affordable to offer people like,
00:43:09 well, we can print your stuff like for a year, but I don't want to have time limits.
00:43:14 I want it all.
00:43:16 I don't want the exclusive rights, but I want the perpetual rights.
00:43:20 I, give me your content.
00:43:22 Give me your content, people.
00:43:23 Let me gobble it up.
00:43:24 I put it into my, into my money making machine.
00:43:26 I feel just a little weird about the whole idea of just of, of like
00:43:33 contracts and, and being an arbiter of quality to be on this potentially lucrative enterprise.
00:43:42 Like the idea for me initially was just an excuse to, to get work in, you know, a motivating tool.
00:43:49 Ah, shit.
00:43:50 And, and you're thinking of it as like a, as a, you know, a money making venture.
00:43:55 Yeah.
00:43:56 And I don't feel like I'm qualified to be like an arbiter of quality for a comic thing when my
00:44:00 comics are, you know, they're fine.
00:44:03 But like, I don't know.
00:44:05 I don't feel like I'm the right person for that sort of a job.
00:44:14 I ain't no publisher.
00:44:15 I ain't no market analyst.
00:44:17 Maybe, maybe it's, maybe it's best to just think about, to just worry about the electronic rights
00:44:22 for now.
00:44:24 I think so.
00:44:25 All right.
00:44:26 At least just for now.
00:44:27 Like I need to get my foot in the door of, you know, making money off my art.
00:44:33 That's where my mind is at.
00:44:37 True.
00:44:39 Oh, speaking of, I started, I started working on Obescapades again.
00:44:44 I'm on it.
00:44:45 I'm on the case.
00:44:47 Nice.
00:44:47 It's getting, it's getting there.
00:44:50 How many pixels?
00:44:53 Hang on.
00:44:53 Let me count.
00:44:55 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
00:44:58 Very, very, very low res images.
00:44:59 Oh, should I?
00:45:00 I lost count.
00:45:00 Hang on.
00:45:00 I guess I'm right.
00:45:01 One, two, three, four, five, six.
00:45:07 The images are only like, they started like, I think it's like 190 by 270.
00:45:11 And then I blow them up.
00:45:12 I'm sort of laying them out.
00:45:15 It's actually really hard and kind of annoying to like fit them to like a page.
00:45:21 It's because they, okay.
00:45:24 I had a couple of, I had like a handful of images that I had put on my Twitter,
00:45:30 but that I had not published on my website.
00:45:34 So I started there and I tried to take those and like just put them to a page
00:45:39 and be like, how do they look on the page?
00:45:41 And I managed to figure it out.
00:45:42 I managed to get them looking like, okay, this is readable.
00:45:46 It's, it's very, it's very annoying.
00:45:50 It's very annoying because there's not like a standard way to do it.
00:45:53 I kind of have to like size every image and be like, how big should it be?
00:45:57 Where should it be?
00:45:58 What order should they go and where should the words be?
00:45:59 I kind of had to just figure that out as I go every time.
00:46:02 And it took a while.
00:46:03 And so I did a bunch of that with those existing updates.
00:46:06 And then I started drawing a couple more new ones.
00:46:09 And I don't know, I hope, I hope that I can sort of streamline the process
00:46:17 and it'll get a little faster as I get a little more used to doing it this way.
00:46:25 But I'm glad to be drawing again, even though I've only really just started,
00:46:29 but I did start and that's the hardest part is starting.
00:46:33 Yes.
00:46:34 Yes.
00:46:34 Yes.
00:46:35 Well done.
00:46:36 Thank you.
00:46:37 You put the pen to the paper.
00:46:39 And I, and you know what?
00:46:40 I remembered that Biscopades is cool, actually.
00:46:45 And yes, that's how it was always how it happens.
00:46:47 Yeah.
00:46:48 And nobody actually go back and you're like, oh, I would read this.
00:46:51 I did read this.
00:46:52 I made this.
00:46:55 You know what?
00:46:55 Well, you know what?
00:46:56 You know what the thing is?
00:46:56 I don't know if I, well, some of Biscopades as it currently exists,
00:47:01 I think is good and I would read some of it is bad and looks like crap.
00:47:06 But where Biscopades, I might have, I might have gone on this spiel already.
00:47:12 So I won't belabor it.
00:47:13 But Biscopades has not revealed what it is actually about yet.
00:47:19 Biscopades has not showed its hand and the ideas that I had for when that happens.
00:47:27 I don't know.
00:47:27 I find them really fun and cool.
00:47:29 So when I'm excited to get there and then I'm excited to right now, I'm like,
00:47:37 it's all, it's all set up.
00:47:38 It's all set up.
00:47:40 Nice.
00:47:41 Yeah, I'm just very excited to make that happen.
00:47:44 And I don't know.
00:47:45 I don't even know what I don't know exactly what it's going to look like.
00:47:47 But I am, I look forward to finding out.
00:47:51 I had some ideas about.
00:47:53 I'm fucking around right now.
00:47:54 And I stop finding out.
00:47:56 Yeah.
00:47:58 I had some, I had some ideas about,
00:48:02 I had some ideas about what gluttony could be used for.
00:48:06 I almost don't even really want to talk about why I thought my ideas were good.
00:48:11 Because they sort of figure into like the real, like what, like the actual like purpose
00:48:18 and concept behind Biscopades, which is sort of not even really apparent yet.
00:48:24 So I won't even go into them.
00:48:25 But I had, I was walking the other day, I was walking here and I was like,
00:48:29 oh, it could do that.
00:48:30 Oh, that fits perfectly.
00:48:31 Oh, yes.
00:48:32 That makes perfect sense in the future.
00:48:36 In the story concept, as I understand it.
00:48:39 And I'll sure I'll do that soon.
00:48:43 Okay.
00:48:43 You know, when it comes to story concepts, I've been, I've been really deep.
00:48:49 Well, not really deep, but I've been very excited about using this program called obsidian
00:48:54 to write all my notes down.
00:48:57 Isn't that like a, isn't that like a planning app or like a scheduling?
00:49:00 It's a planning and schedule, but it has this great feature where
00:49:04 if you do, if you make a note, whatever, and then you put two square brackets and some text inside,
00:49:14 that creates a new note that links from that word.
00:49:18 So it's a hyperlink to a different note document.
00:49:21 And I've been doing that to build up the world of my comics of bell,
00:49:26 jpe, and, and Lord of ghosts and stuff and adding like character entries and then a link
00:49:32 to what other characters they know, things they've done, and like places they're from.
00:49:38 And I've started to build all graph.
00:49:40 And the great thing about obsidian, let me get a picture,
00:49:45 is this graph view that shows the links you've made between notes
00:49:51 in a little thing like this.
00:49:52 And I've colored them based on whether they're a character, a location, a comic,
00:49:57 or a jewel, an endless ruck.
00:50:00 What, what the fuck?
00:50:02 So you got here, you can see like bell jpe has like
00:50:05 all the characters from bell jpe and the places involved and things.
00:50:11 I go into like, if I go into the jewel of the jewel of splish is an endless rock.
00:50:18 Did I know that already?
00:50:19 I might have, I might have heard that.
00:50:22 I've definitely explained that, but like, I don't think it's been like well understood.
00:50:29 It's part of my big lore, you see, but if I click on the ostrich cathedral,
00:50:33 this is the note and it contains things like this.
00:50:38 A big, oh, this is cool.
00:50:40 And it's just sort of, I, I, I, I sprawl it out from there.
00:50:43 It's like building, building the wiki, but in such a simple way that I can easily add pages and,
00:50:50 and stuff.
00:50:51 This is just like, this is just like the, the freaking,
00:50:57 I don't even remember what it's called.
00:50:59 The thing in outer wilds that lets you like track the things, the things you found.
00:51:04 This is the thing I was playing out to wilds doing the DLC.
00:51:07 And I was like, ah, this is just like that program I saw like a few weeks ago.
00:51:12 Because my brother told me about it.
00:51:13 I'm like, I got to do it.
00:51:15 I got to do it for my thing.
00:51:16 And so I'm doing an outer wilds connect the dots database of all the stuff that happens in the
00:51:23 comic and all of my ideas for different things that have not currently been shown.
00:51:28 So for bell jpeg two, that'll be instrumental in figuring out where it goes.
00:51:33 Yeah.
00:51:33 And Clarissa gun smoke and whatever adventures she has after that.
00:51:38 And anything else.
00:51:39 It's great.
00:51:41 This is very interesting.
00:51:43 My, my dad always used to try to get me to use like, not stuff like this, but like,
00:51:49 he would always buy me like little like calendars and like notebooks and like planners and stuff
00:51:53 and try to encourage me to like write down notes and stuff and like keep track of things.
00:51:59 And I always and I always spurned them.
00:52:02 I like always hated that shit.
00:52:07 I like this is just a cool.
00:52:09 This is I mean, this is more interesting than than that.
00:52:13 Is another another trying to try and try and try to load a ghost's
00:52:18 comic.
00:52:19 Oh.
00:52:20 So it's gotten the secondy and like a calm over there.
00:52:24 I'm trying to, I'm trying to decide.
00:52:28 I'm trying to decide if this would be useful for bescapades or not.
00:52:32 You know what's going to be very useful for is figuring out how red noir fits into the Lord of Ghosts.
00:52:40 Red noir.
00:52:41 I'm glad I'm glad to hear you mentioned red noir again.
00:52:45 Yeah.
00:52:48 Such a good name for such a short lived little project.
00:52:52 Yeah, glad.
00:52:52 Glad that's not completely forgotten.
00:52:55 Yeah.
00:52:55 Yeah, I reread it in the process of putting it on my website.
00:53:00 Give and take dot site, newly revamped.
00:53:05 And I was like, wow, this is good.
00:53:07 This is a good little red man comic, but a noir.
00:53:10 Somebody somebody commented and said like nice job, Ben, nice job on the website.
00:53:16 It's very, it's very, it's like, I think they said it was like simple and clean or it's like nice and
00:53:21 simple.
00:53:22 And I was like, thank you.
00:53:23 Yes, that's what I want.
00:53:24 I just want a freaking easy to use website with a couple of pages to find the stuff you're looking for.
00:53:31 That's all that's all it is.
00:53:32 And that's all I was trying to do with it.
00:53:35 And I think I succeeded.
00:53:37 And reminder, if you want the episode MP3 is a lot of people use like the podcast apps.
00:53:42 If you want, if you just want to download the MP3 is and listen to them on an MP3 player or
00:53:46 something, they are all except for the last like two up on the PCP website, perfect comic
00:53:54 party dot com, the procrastiners podcast dot com slash episodes dot HTML, I think.
00:54:00 And you can also get there's I have zipped collections.
00:54:03 You can download zip files and then unzip them.
00:54:06 And it'll have like every episode of the podcast that was on the PCP channel.
00:54:11 Every PCP episode from a certain year, all of the Digibro decompression chambers, etc, etc.
00:54:18 I hope those are convenient for people.
00:54:22 There's a lot of work.
00:54:23 It was a lot of work just putting that all together.
00:54:26 And if I missed it, and if I missed anything, let me know in the comments if I missed if
00:54:30 there's any collections you'd like to see or stuff that I didn't didn't get.
00:54:35 There might be other like random crap from the channel that I just totally forgot about.
00:54:39 They got the panel casts.
00:54:42 We got the Nauru cast.
00:54:44 We've got I don't even remember what else we got guys isolation training.
00:54:51 You know, what the hell was that?
00:54:53 It was one time Nate did a did a decompression chamber and he called it isolation training.
00:55:00 Yeah.
00:55:01 Oh, you said panel reminded me of one other thing that's cool.
00:55:06 The Kindle create is like the program you use to turn like a PDF into a Kindle ebook.
00:55:14 And what it does, there's this fundal function.
00:55:17 If it's, you know, graphic novel, you can auto auto generate panels.
00:55:26 And so when you're reading on a phone or a Kindle or whatever,
00:55:30 you can double tap on a panel and it'll zoom in and full screen that particular panel.
00:55:36 So you can switch, you can flip through the panels rather than full pages if
00:55:40 if the pages are like too small on a phone or something.
00:55:43 Instead of having to zoom, you can look at a panel and it was like scroll to the next one.
00:55:49 And I did that for Clarissa and it like pretty well like I only had to edit a few of them matched
00:55:56 the panels on the page to little little rectangles that it would zoom in on.
00:56:03 Wait, so it so it like auto finds the panels and like makes them their own thing?
00:56:08 Makes them their own like individual image that you can scroll left and right through
00:56:13 if you want to.
00:56:13 And then you double tap the panel to go back to full page view, which is a pretty cool.
00:56:18 That's actually very interesting.
00:56:19 That actually sounds pretty cool.
00:56:21 Yeah. You don't really need it for Clarissa because the text is quite big for that.
00:56:30 But if it's like a traditional comic book with tiny little text, then it's quite useful.
00:56:39 But yeah, I've learned so much about Kindle.
00:56:41 I've never used it.
00:56:43 I don't think I will use it, but it's cool.
00:56:47 But also by the PDF, if you don't care about that because I get more money.
00:56:51 And then by the paperback because it's cooler to have something on your shelf.
00:56:56 And then by the Kindle as well.
00:56:57 I can't stop. I can't stop consuming.
00:57:02 I want to consume all forms of the content.
00:57:05 I'm the chef and you better eat your greens, which is my work.
00:57:13 I have been trying to create twizzlers.
00:57:21 I'm trying to duplicate the twizzlers recipe in my candy making workshop.
00:57:27 And it's hard.
00:57:29 It's hard.
00:57:30 And I bought a jug of glycerin.
00:57:33 And I'm going to try putting that in there and see what happens.
00:57:38 Oh, is that licorice you're trying to make?
00:57:40 I am also.
00:57:41 I also got some stuff for licorice.
00:57:43 I was just talking about cherry twizzlers, just the consistency.
00:57:47 Yeah.
00:57:48 I am going to get some licorice extract and like once I know how to make them,
00:57:52 I will like make that with them because I like that.
00:57:56 But I got this stuff.
00:57:58 Okay, I found this stuff.
00:58:00 This was so amazing.
00:58:01 There's this stuff.
00:58:03 Apparently it's a naturally occurring salt.
00:58:06 It's called sal ammonia or it is ammonium chloride.
00:58:12 And I guess they put it in certain licorices.
00:58:16 It's like salty licorice flavoring.
00:58:19 And listen, listen to this.
00:58:23 This is the second paragraph from the Wikipedia article on Sal Ammoniac.
00:58:27 Pliny in book 31 of his natural history refers to a salt produced in the Roman province of
00:58:34 Sirenica called Haman, Hamaniacum, Hamaniacum is so called because of its proximity to the
00:58:41 nearby temple of Jupiter Amun, Greek Amon.
00:58:46 However, the description Pliny gives of the salt does not conform to the properties of
00:58:50 ammonium chloride.
00:58:51 According to Herbert Hoover's commentary, in his English translation of George's
00:58:57 Agricola's Deire Metallica, it is likely to have been common sea salt.
00:59:01 In any case, that salt ultimately gave ammonia and ammonium compounds their name.
00:59:06 Herbert Hoover, the president of the United States,
00:59:11 translated this ancient fricking Roman book about the nature of metals and salts.
00:59:21 And he's excited here in this Wikipedia article.
00:59:26 And I did a double take at that.
00:59:30 So wait, ammonia because it's close to a temple?
00:59:34 Okay, yes. This salt that Pliny describes was called Ammoniacum because it was near
00:59:42 to the temple of Jupiter Amun, like that's where the Amon in Ammoniacum comes from.
00:59:49 And that name for that particular salt that Pliny describes is where, yeah,
00:59:53 the chemicals Ammonia and ammonium get their names.
00:59:58 It's so funny how words are just used.
01:00:01 Even though it literally is not what he was talking about.
01:00:04 He was talking about something else.
01:00:07 He was just talking about salt, regular salt.
01:00:10 It's fun when you realize how human history is so much.
01:00:16 All these names, it's like, oh, that doesn't sound like anything.
01:00:19 They're all derived from just like looking at something and saying,
01:00:22 what's that, the big hill?
01:00:24 But you say it in your language and that becomes the name of a mountain.
01:00:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:00:29 Isn't that?
01:00:29 And it's like, that's how world-building is.
01:00:31 I should do that for my world-building thing.
01:00:34 I should come up with the reason people call them certain things the way they is.
01:00:40 It's just cool.
01:00:41 Because they just saw a place and they called it the big place.
01:00:45 It's just-
01:00:45 That's why I called my town something town.
01:00:47 It wasn't because I couldn't think of anything.
01:00:49 It was because they just-
01:00:50 That's just how you name things.
01:00:54 And then it sounds cool in another language when someone calls it
01:00:59 that in your language, but they don't know what it means, to them it's just a fancy word.
01:01:04 And that's where names come from.
01:01:05 Honestly, I always felt like really dumb when I was trying, when I was younger
01:01:10 and trying to come up with like fantasy names for things.
01:01:13 I'd be like, okay, just throw some vowels in there, some consonants,
01:01:16 like lots of consonants, more than usual.
01:01:20 And an average ratio of consonants to vowels will simply not suffice.
01:01:26 Yeah.
01:01:27 For the fanciness, for the fanciness of the concept I'm trying to convey here.
01:01:31 It's like Lord Blu Targoth and the Kingdom of Smyr Skalosh.
01:01:39 Got it.
01:01:40 I mean, that's funny.
01:01:40 Got it in one.
01:01:41 I like Smyr Skalosh.
01:01:44 Yeah, it's not bad.
01:01:45 But like, you know, you would try and copy Lord of the Rings and come up with things
01:01:49 that sounded a little too close to everything else, Elven stuff.
01:01:53 Right, right.
01:01:54 And you didn't have any basis for the reasoning.
01:01:56 You're just like, what sounds like a place that isn't a real place?
01:01:59 You ever watch, you know, oh God, what's his name?
01:02:07 Krusty the Clang.
01:02:08 No, it's that Jan Misali.
01:02:11 You ever watch Jan Misali?
01:02:15 Yes.
01:02:15 Have you watched any of his older, what are they called?
01:02:20 The ones where he takes a conlang critic.
01:02:25 A conlang is like a fake language that somebody made up.
01:02:29 And he has a series of videos from like a few years ago where he like goes through
01:02:34 various popular ones and like analyzes them and like ranks them on like how good or shitty they are.
01:02:41 And some of them are really weird.
01:02:43 I've not seen those.
01:02:45 Jan Misali is the guy who did that video about the
01:02:49 anime song that everyone knows, but it was actually Swedish.
01:02:53 Yes.
01:02:54 He did do that.
01:02:55 Yes.
01:02:55 He did do that one about the not Numa Numa.
01:03:07 Caramel Dancin.
01:03:08 Right.
01:03:09 I had to go through the lyrics in my head to get to the end to be like Caramel.
01:03:14 That's the name.
01:03:15 Got it.
01:03:17 Yeah, he did do that video.
01:03:18 I had found his channel a little bit before that because he did one about
01:03:24 how many Mario games, how many Super Mario games are there.
01:03:27 That video blew up as well.
01:03:30 And then the Caramel Dancin video really blew up,
01:03:32 especially because there was like a big like legal thing about it.
01:03:37 Is it still taken down?
01:03:40 I think that's sorted out.
01:03:44 I don't know.
01:03:45 Well, it's a good video.
01:03:46 It is a really good video.
01:03:47 Find it if you can.
01:03:48 But yeah, the conlang critics are interesting and he does like,
01:03:52 you know, he does ones like from Tolkien and he does ones from Song of Ice and Fire.
01:04:00 And he does other like weird ones that were like made by like various people in history
01:04:06 as like a genuine attempt to create a universal language.
01:04:08 And those are all terrible.
01:04:09 Well, a lot.
01:04:10 Most of them are.
01:04:14 There's that one.
01:04:15 There's that one that's like it doesn't even have letters.
01:04:18 It's made of like knots.
01:04:20 It's made of like lines that like tie into knots.
01:04:24 And like the number of like twists in the knot is like what determines what it means.
01:04:29 That one's awesome.
01:04:32 Like like a like a like a piece of rope or like a drawing.
01:04:37 Well, it's a draw.
01:04:38 I mean, you maybe could do it with.
01:04:41 OK, it's called Kellen with with a line over the first E.
01:04:45 And it looks like this and I don't know how to read it.
01:04:51 Oh, that's like that looks Celtic.
01:04:55 It does look Celtic.
01:04:56 It might be like Celtic inspired, but only in like visual design.
01:05:03 So what's this word?
01:05:05 I don't fucking know.
01:05:07 Yeah, I've no idea.
01:05:10 Is that like an actual end and start like it starts like that?
01:05:14 Look, then swirls all the way around.
01:05:16 Look, I I I couldn't I can't explain anything about this to you.
01:05:22 Other than that supposedly this is what Kellen looks like.
01:05:25 Well, I'll choose to be offended by it.
01:05:27 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:05:29 Yeah. You can also write it.
01:05:31 You can write it fancy and then it looks like this.
01:05:38 It mostly just looks cool.
01:05:39 Like I think it's not.
01:05:40 I think it's not like that useful as like a language for communicating.
01:05:44 It's like an art language.
01:05:45 It's like a language that's made to it's made to look pretty.
01:05:49 And it does communicate something, but it's like it's it's art first and foremost.
01:05:54 Yeah, that's cool.
01:05:55 I think that there is like obviously for humans, this is incomprehensible at a glance.
01:06:03 No, you well, yeah, yeah, because you don't under because you don't know it,
01:06:07 but you could learn it.
01:06:08 Could you though?
01:06:10 Yes.
01:06:11 But you said you couldn't figure it out.
01:06:14 You're so stupid because I didn't you have to you would have to learn it like a language.
01:06:21 You have to I don't know.
01:06:22 There's a freaking code you got to I just think I just think when it comes to like
01:06:27 knots, that's one of like the hardest things to understand at looking at it.
01:06:34 Like when you see a tangled mess of cables,
01:06:36 you think you think that knots are the hardest thing to understand?
01:06:39 No, I mean like for a person, a letter or like a kanji or like a thing
01:06:46 is easier because each one is like by themselves.
01:06:50 You know, that's why like right joined up writing or like whatever is it's harder to
01:06:55 read and things that are like, where do you where do you begin with that with this line?
01:07:01 And that's why you can't untangle the Christmas lights.
01:07:03 And that's why learning how to do knots is difficult and tying your shoes.
01:07:08 I'm just saying lines, big long strings are like the enemy of human thought.
01:07:15 That's an interesting.
01:07:16 That's my hypothesis.
01:07:17 Interesting way to look at it.
01:07:19 I feel you, I agree with you.
01:07:21 Obviously, listen, I'm not going to I'm not going to argue that obviously
01:07:25 this is not the most intuitive way to put to put concepts into like into like writing.
01:07:32 But I feel like that they took a non-standard initial conceit of how to do it and ran with it.
01:07:37 I feel like that's no, I do.
01:07:39 I do like I think it's pretty neat.
01:07:41 It is pretty neat.
01:07:42 Where I was going with it, though, is like, what if there's an alien that finds this a lot easier
01:07:47 to comprehend than single like separated elements like letters?
01:07:52 What if they can be like, oh, yeah, I know what that is.
01:07:54 Like even if they don't know the language, they can learn it real quick.
01:08:00 But if they try to learn like if the alien was like a worm and like they had to like
01:08:04 Yeah, a little worm aliens.
01:08:06 They understand things like length and like getting tied up and twisted around and stuff.
01:08:11 They get twisted every day.
01:08:15 I don't know why that was so funny.
01:08:19 Yes, they get you.
01:08:20 Oh, you mean like they get they smoke weed and they drink and they get they get twisted.
01:08:26 No, no, I mean they tangle themselves up because they're wormies.
01:08:30 Oh, sure.
01:08:30 Yeah, would you still love me if I was always a worm?
01:08:34 Would you still would you love me if I was a worm and I was like an alcoholic and a stoner and like
01:08:40 I couldn't and I was all disoriented all the time and I kept tying myself up in knots
01:08:45 and the knots said offensive things in in Kellen just by coincidence.
01:08:49 No, and then you get canceled on worm Twitter.
01:08:51 That would be the line.
01:08:52 Listen to submit the line to submit your worm comic.
01:08:57 You have to submit a photo of yourself saying the N word in Kellen.
01:09:04 Let's ask him easily how you write it.
01:09:06 I bet.
01:09:06 Yes, a YouTube comment.
01:09:08 That'll be that'll work.
01:09:10 Hey, hey, hey, Jan.
01:09:12 Big fan got a got a question for you.
01:09:16 Say I wanted to write a certain word in Kellen.
01:09:19 Here's here it is.
01:09:20 All right, let me know.
01:09:21 Bye.
01:09:23 Why did you even get on this topic?
01:09:26 I something about I don't know.
01:09:29 You brought up Kellen for some reason.
01:09:33 I don't even remember.
01:09:33 We're talking about world building ammonia.
01:09:37 Oh, it's not name and stuff.
01:09:39 Name and stuff.
01:09:40 Name and stuff and Tolkien and yeah,
01:09:42 the sound and like Elvish and whatever.
01:09:44 Whatever.
01:09:44 I just like those.
01:09:45 I just like those videos.
01:09:49 That's all my notes, by the way.
01:09:50 I have I have no more subject.
01:09:52 I was reminded of something.
01:09:53 I forget why.
01:09:55 But I wrote it down.
01:09:57 Turkey 2000s.
01:09:58 Okay.
01:09:59 Oh, because we talk, we talk, we talk about Turkey Twizzlers.
01:10:02 I saw this tweet of yours, by the way.
01:10:03 Yeah, you said Twizzlers.
01:10:05 And I was like, oh, Turkey Twizzlers.
01:10:07 That was a famous school lunch cafeteria food
01:10:11 that was really bad for you.
01:10:13 And it's famous because Jamie Oliver got it banned
01:10:15 and everyone was mad.
01:10:17 Cringe, I want one.
01:10:20 I think they look good.
01:10:21 They look all right.
01:10:22 Well, they look like meat in a swirl.
01:10:25 And I don't think I ever really liked the taste
01:10:28 more than like normal nuggets or normal.
01:10:32 They had turkey dinosaurs.
01:10:33 That was the other thing.
01:10:34 Turkey nuggets in the shape of dinosaurs.
01:10:37 And those were better.
01:10:40 And then they had like the potato smiley faces
01:10:43 and spaghetti hoops and, you know,
01:10:46 all sorts of these like kid friendly processed foods.
01:10:50 I had smiley fries.
01:10:51 We had smiley fries.
01:10:53 I walked over to my refrigerator
01:10:54 to get one of my attempts at a Twizzler out of the fridge.
01:10:58 Not successful, much too soft.
01:11:01 But yes, I remember and because I hadn't thought about it in years
01:11:07 and my brother was over for the weekend and he mentioned it.
01:11:11 And I was like, oh my God, I remember those Turkey 2000s.
01:11:17 Turkey 2000s was a turkey nugget.
01:11:20 I don't know why so many things were made of turkey.
01:11:22 I think maybe it was just a it was a recipe
01:11:24 for really cheap like bullshit.
01:11:28 But like Turkey 2000s was the number 2000 connected, you know.
01:11:33 So there was like a big long thing with holes
01:11:36 so you could see the O's and the two.
01:11:39 And it was around the turn of the millennium.
01:11:43 They would have these in school dinners
01:11:45 because it was like it's the millennium, you know.
01:11:48 They just made them in the shape of the number 2000.
01:11:50 They made turkey nuggets in the shape of the number 2000.
01:11:54 They were called Turkey 2000s.
01:11:57 Why wouldn't they just make them in the shape of twos and zeros?
01:12:00 Because that's too many different parts.
01:12:03 I don't fucking know.
01:12:04 They wanted to make one mold instead of a billion.
01:12:08 I mean four or two.
01:12:10 I guess one mold instead of two actually.
01:12:12 Yeah, yeah.
01:12:15 But then you could make 002.
01:12:17 You could make 020.
01:12:18 You know, you couldn't actually, it wouldn't be 2000
01:12:21 unless the child placed them in the right orientation.
01:12:25 Well, you just make three times as many zeros
01:12:27 and then it'll work itself out.
01:12:29 No, but what if one kid doesn't get a two?
01:12:30 Like they get like a ladle full of fucking-
01:12:35 Of zeros?
01:12:35 Of zeros.
01:12:37 Then he gets what he deserves.
01:12:38 I'm sorry.
01:12:41 Some people just don't deserve the two.
01:12:44 I know these existed.
01:12:45 My brother remembered them.
01:12:46 And then we went on a nostalgia, like find this stuff.
01:12:52 We found some other things.
01:12:53 We found like school dinner cake, which I will find an image of.
01:13:01 Think of like Google the exact phrasing.
01:13:03 Yes, school dinner cake.
01:13:04 It was a sponge cake with sprinkles and like white icing.
01:13:07 And apparently it was just called school dinner.
01:13:10 It was just school cake.
01:13:12 School cake.
01:13:13 And they would have it and they would have custard or nothing.
01:13:18 But that was like a cafeteria like staple of primary schools
01:13:22 and secondary schools, I guess.
01:13:24 I definitely remember those a lot.
01:13:26 It was always nice when for the dessert,
01:13:29 they had those because they were tasty.
01:13:33 We found other things.
01:13:34 We found the turkey dinosaurs.
01:13:36 And we found a forum where somebody mentioned Turkey 2000s,
01:13:40 that exact phrase.
01:13:41 So we know that there's at least three people in the universe
01:13:44 that remember Turkey 2000s.
01:13:46 But I could not find a single image on Google
01:13:51 or any listing in like top 38 most nostalgic school dinner items from the UK.
01:13:59 And I'm like, why is it not there?
01:14:02 That's such a weird thing.
01:14:05 You would think there'd be.
01:14:06 Yeah, like I Google that and I can't find any pictures of it.
01:14:08 There's no there's no simple way to get it.
01:14:11 Because like I type in Turkey 2000s, I get all of the knowledge,
01:14:15 all of the articles about Jamie Oliver and Turkey Twizzlers,
01:14:18 which were more popular and they weren't just about the year 2000s.
01:14:23 And there's plenty of people who are nostalgic for post Turkey 2000s, I'm sure.
01:14:28 There's only a certain amount of people who are at school
01:14:31 in the right age bracket to even know about Turkey 2000s.
01:14:37 And it's like, this is the biggest mystery of our generation.
01:14:39 I'm determined for someone else to please tell me the information
01:14:43 because I couldn't find it.
01:14:45 Anyone out there in the audience, if you remember Turkey 2000s,
01:14:50 might have just been a UK thing.
01:14:52 I would assume they didn't have like a worldwide thing with this.
01:14:57 It's very silly.
01:14:59 But like maybe any other countries, any other people from other countries
01:15:04 know about the Turkey 2000.
01:15:06 I think it's probably a UK thing because we didn't even have,
01:15:09 we didn't have Turkey Twizzlers.
01:15:11 We had smiley fries.
01:15:12 Could be other European countries.
01:15:15 But yeah.
01:15:16 Anyone else remember that?
01:15:17 Because it was so frustrating trying to Google it
01:15:22 because there'd be Turkey dinosaurs.
01:15:24 Nostalgic things would come up with buzz feet articles about lists of bullshit.
01:15:31 It's just like, oh, remember this from when you were a kid?
01:15:34 School cafeteria.
01:15:37 Beans, sure.
01:15:40 Potatoes and beans.
01:15:41 Oh, smiley faces.
01:15:43 We all like those, the smiley potatoes.
01:15:46 Because they have mashed potatoes inside.
01:15:49 I want some of those still.
01:15:51 Yeah, they're still good.
01:15:52 They had like potato waffles and just bad food, but cafeteria food
01:16:04 and old food, nostalgic food, and it's just too specific.
01:16:08 And there's too many things that are similar to that search result,
01:16:13 but not the same thing that you just get led off in the wrong way over and over.
01:16:21 I couldn't find it.
01:16:22 I searched for a whole 20 minutes.
01:16:26 It's impossible.
01:16:27 I mean, I can't find it either.
01:16:29 And it seems so visually bizarre and idiosyncratic
01:16:32 that you would think there'd be pictures of it.
01:16:35 But what I need is some sort of lead that I can follow up on.
01:16:41 Some sort of like, what were the company's names, the branded company's names,
01:16:48 that sold all of this stuff to school cafeteria's in the first place?
01:16:54 Is there a name for a company?
01:16:55 Is there a series of companies?
01:16:56 I don't know where to start looking for that information.
01:16:59 But if I can find that, then I might be able to get a product list.
01:17:03 I might be able to search a way, like avoid searches for nostalgic image board
01:17:13 article bullshit that is distracting and filling up my search results with nothing.
01:17:19 I know they exist.
01:17:22 This is my white whale.
01:17:23 This is my Turkey 2000.
01:17:25 Are you sure they weren't Turkey 2000?
01:17:28 Just such a funny name.
01:17:28 Are you sure they didn't have a different name?
01:17:30 Maybe like, I don't know, Millennium Turkey?
01:17:33 I typed in different things like Millennium Turkey.
01:17:36 But then I came up with the Country Turkey and something about the Millennium.
01:17:39 Turkey 2K?
01:17:41 No, 2K was a much, that referring to a year as K is such a 2010 thing.
01:17:52 It was, I've never heard that before, like more recently.
01:17:56 What about Turkey Twizzlers 2000?
01:18:03 Well, it wouldn't be a Twizzler.
01:18:05 It wasn't a Twizzler.
01:18:06 But it sounds like it might have been the same company that made them.
01:18:12 Honestly, it could be.
01:18:13 It might have been processed in the same factory.
01:18:15 It could be, but they tasted different.
01:18:17 They tasted more like the Turkey dinosaurs.
01:18:19 If I know who made the Turkey dinosaurs, I could probably be like,
01:18:24 you know, that company based in like Germany made,
01:18:29 squished Turkey stuff for the whole of Europe.
01:18:33 And it was great.
01:18:36 Well, it was the best of times.
01:18:39 Google tells me that the first result from Google is like a brand called Bernard Matthews
01:18:45 Turkey Dinosaurs made by Sainsbury.
01:18:49 Sainsbury is okay.
01:18:50 That is a UK.
01:18:53 Sainsbury Turkey 2000.
01:19:03 But then it would be like, oh, buy a Turkey at Christmas from Sainsbury.
01:19:06 It's like, no, it'll never, it'll never show up.
01:19:09 Is it a supermarket chain?
01:19:11 It's a supermarket, yeah.
01:19:13 Buy this, buy that.
01:19:15 Yeah.
01:19:16 Like, how do I search for the archives?
01:19:18 Sainsbury's archive, they don't have that.
01:19:23 I think you hallucinated it.
01:19:25 No, I absolutely did not hallucinate it.
01:19:27 I think there would be pictures online if this was real.
01:19:30 I think everyone's forgotten, except for the people on the forum.
01:19:33 I think you are abusing your platform to try and spread a false rumor.
01:19:39 Bring back Turkey 2000s.
01:19:41 You're trying to start a Mandela effect in it.
01:19:43 If we need Turkey 2000 and 23s, we need Turkey 2000.
01:19:46 There's no way.
01:19:47 It can't possibly have happened.
01:19:49 It can't be real.
01:19:50 It's too stupid.
01:19:51 No, it's so stupid that it has to be real.
01:19:54 I remember eating them.
01:19:55 I'm like, wow, this is fun.
01:19:56 That's a pretty, that's weird.
01:19:57 Why do they make it?
01:19:58 Because it was like, it's a millennium.
01:20:01 Nobody has seen a millennium ever.
01:20:02 Nobody has seen a millennium.
01:20:03 I remember eating them and thinking,
01:20:05 hmm, I love living in a goofy alternate timeline
01:20:08 where we make stupid Turkey shapes like these.
01:20:11 They made Turkey dinosaurs.
01:20:12 They could make a number 2000 for like a brief marketing stint for a millennium.
01:20:18 They haven't had a millennium for a thousand years.
01:20:20 They were excited.
01:20:23 I wonder if they made 1000 turkeys for the first millennium.
01:20:28 They didn't even have turkeys back then.
01:20:32 They might actually not have.
01:20:33 They might have had the one or two.
01:20:34 They had, is Turkey like an American bird?
01:20:39 Like in the Americas?
01:20:40 I want to say yes.
01:20:42 I want to say, yeah, it might be.
01:20:43 It might be a native North America.
01:20:45 They may not even have had chicken in the year 1000.
01:20:48 They would have had no nuggets whatsoever.
01:20:50 Yeah, they probably didn't have.
01:20:52 Well, maybe only in like China.
01:20:54 They had the, or whatever the commonly domesticated breed of chicken.
01:21:00 I am absolutely 100% certain this is the most certain I've ever been.
01:21:05 Turkey 2000s are real.
01:21:07 I might have a name wrong, but they were a breaded chicken or turkey nugget
01:21:13 that was shaped in the year, in the number 2000.
01:21:17 What if I just go 2000 nuggets?
01:21:20 You'll get McDonald's menu.
01:21:24 No, no, actually I get the basketball team, the nuggets.
01:21:29 There's too many things called the same thing.
01:21:31 The Denver Nuggets.
01:21:35 Denver Nuggets, god damn it.
01:21:37 I assume it refers to gold nuggets.
01:21:40 It might be a college team?
01:21:42 Probably.
01:21:44 Denver Nuggets.
01:21:45 Did you see the college hockey team?
01:21:49 I forget what city, like the San Jose Sharks tweeted this like
01:21:54 a very like informative thread about like alternate gender identities in like other
01:21:59 cultures around the world, like various Native American tribes and like Mesoamerican and
01:22:06 stuff and like cool, but like why did the San Jose, there was no explanation for why
01:22:12 the San Jose Sharks were tweeting, they just did.
01:22:16 Uh, and yeah, I still don't, I don't understand it, but cool, I guess.
01:22:23 I just want other people to be like, oh yeah, I remember those.
01:22:27 It's weird that I can't find them on Google.
01:22:29 Please comment that if that's the truth.
01:22:32 Don't lie.
01:22:33 Chicken nuggets, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
01:22:39 I'm going to solve this.
01:22:40 I think it was just because chicken 2000s doesn't ring a bell and turkey 2000s really does.
01:22:45 Are you, are you ready for me to solve this conundrum?
01:22:48 I'm going to do it right now.
01:22:48 Oh my God, please hang on, you're going to have to give me a second.
01:22:56 You're just going to download an image of a metal finger and show that to me.
01:23:00 That's what you're going to do.
01:23:04 Here's your fucking turkey 2000s motherfucker.
01:23:08 There's minions shaped turkey nuggets.
01:23:12 See, I think the fact that it's, they could shape nuggets into shapes brings credence to this.
01:23:21 Here we go.
01:23:21 Chat GPT.
01:23:22 In the UK, were there turkey nuggets in the shape of the number 2000 made to celebrate the new millennium?
01:23:29 Yes, it is true that turkey nuggets in the shape of the number 2000 were made in the UK
01:23:33 to celebrate the new millennium.
01:23:34 The product was called Millennium Turkey Nuggets and was produced by the Bernard Matthews Food
01:23:39 Company. They were made available for sale in the UK in the lead up to the year 2000,
01:23:43 and the idea was to create a novelty food item that would appeal to consumers looking for something
01:23:46 special to mark the occasion. However, the product was not very successful and was eventually
01:23:51 discontinued. So it was Bernard Matthews.
01:23:53 Bernard Matthews is the turkey dinosaur person. There's no images on Google. This is a travesty.
01:24:02 Did nobody take a single picture of the whole time when it was happening?
01:24:06 Okay, it could be lying. Yeah, if we can't corroborate it with proof, then the fact that
01:24:12 Chat GPT says it's true doesn't mean anything.
01:24:15 I believe the AI when it agrees with me.
01:24:18 Yeah, yeah.
01:24:21 I think it's just that Google can't find the image. I think it'll be on a website that's
01:24:25 outside of Google. It'll be on the dark web. The dark web will have what I need.
01:24:30 Yeah, I mean, if it was real, there must be proof somewhere. What about? Okay, what about?
01:24:35 Um.
01:24:38 Millennium turkey. Bernard Matthews, a millennium.
01:24:43 It's just that they have like turkey nuggets and minions, a turkey dinosaurs and minions.
01:24:51 Listen, I appreciate that turkey nuggets can come in any shape that one can imagine.
01:24:57 And anything the mind can dream, a turkey can embody in their nugget form.
01:25:06 But damn, if you can't freaking find it on Google.
01:25:10 Wait a minute. The free library. Okay, here's link page citation. Can I go to that link?
01:25:17 Page URL. Oh, this is the page. Okay.
01:25:22 Uh, identifying a children's product to signify the millennium was difficult for Bernard Matthews,
01:25:26 Fugu's limited. But for the, but from their research, Turkey 2000 was born. Turkey 2000 is
01:25:32 a frozen shaped product with chopped turkey made into 2000 shapes and then covered in crispy
01:25:38 crumb. The 360 gram pan, which contained on average six very large shapes is already available
01:25:46 for sale. This is from September 1st, 1999. I don't know how. So it contains an average
01:25:54 six free large shapes is already available for sale in a metalized film pack. And Bernard
01:25:58 Matthews believes this is the first time such film has been used within the children's sector.
01:26:02 Well, tasty toasties is the name of their anytime snack. These are two ready to cook sandwiches
01:26:08 filled with cheese sauce and turkey ham. Okay, this is just information, but where is it from?
01:26:13 Okay. Chachi BT says they were called millennium turkey nuggets. This article says they were
01:26:17 called Turkey 2000. I remember 2000. We're getting to the bottom of this. No portion of this article
01:26:25 can't be reproduced. So copyright, copyright 1999, food trade, press limited. So this is an excerpt
01:26:35 from that in a website called the free libraries. I'm just going to link that.
01:26:39 I'm going to link that shit. Okay, hang on. So this is from a library that has saved this
01:26:47 information, which I am sure is gone. Otherwise, unless they made print versions of that magazine
01:26:57 and somebody saved one. No. Okay. Wait, Bernard Matthews.com. Maybe they have.
01:27:07 Maybe they have. I doubt it because they're not selling them anymore.
01:27:11 Product range about us. Contact us. Will I contact them? I might. They made turkey twizzlers.
01:27:16 They made turkey twizzlers. That makes sense. You're right. I knew it. I knew it must be the
01:27:21 same guys. Can we get Bernard Matthews on the podcast? Does he do guest appearances?
01:27:30 Oh my God, the Bernard Matthews among us. They do turkey unicorns, turkey teddies, turkey minions,
01:27:39 turkey sandwiches, turkey balls. Okay. Well, great. Good for them.
01:27:46 They have sliced turkey. Like a little nugget in the shape of a sandwich.
01:27:51 I think there's stuff inside it. What was that? Hamwich. Cheesy hamwich. Okay. It's not turkey.
01:27:59 Ham boys? It's a ham boy. Okay. ChatGBT does not have anything help, any helpful advice on me
01:28:07 for where to find pictures of the millennium turkey nuggets? This is... We could try Bing.
01:28:12 I'm going to try Bing. I've never Binged anything before. Oh my God. I hope you don't cring.
01:28:20 No. Wait, what? Oh, yeah. Me too. Bernard, Matthews, Millenia.
01:28:27 Maybe I'll go to their Twitter. I will go to their Twitter. Bernard Matthews food.
01:28:31 At them on Twitter, Bernard. Where are the turkey 2000s? Right. Yes.
01:28:36 No, Bing is returning largely the same.
01:28:47 Largely the same image results.
01:28:51 See turkey twizzlers, turkey twizzlers, turkey dinos. I see... Ew. This has got to be a joke.
01:29:00 I see chicken twizzlers, but they're branded the same way as twizzlers the candy,
01:29:07 so I don't think that's real.
01:29:11 Was there... I wonder if there was a licensing conflict between turkey twizzlers and the candy
01:29:18 twizzlers, which is... I learned that they are owned by a company called Young and Smiley.
01:29:25 All right, I've added Bernard Matthews on Twitter. Please confirm the existence of turkey 2000s.
01:29:35 Cannot find any images on Google, but I know they existed.
01:29:38 Exclamation point. I'm very serious.
01:29:43 What if, hang on, what if we just use the Google, the Twitter search function and like
01:29:49 search for like turkey 2000 and just filtered by images.
01:29:57 Okay, I see your tweets are the latest results for turkey 2000s. Okay, and this is not...
01:30:04 Of course, I'm the biggest. I'm the turkey queen. I'm the 2000s queen. I'm both of those things.
01:30:11 Turkey millennium nuggets. No photo results for turkey millennium nuggets. Jesus.
01:30:17 It's more... It's like... Somebody disappeared it. Somebody disappeared the millennium nugget.
01:30:24 Like that picture of Stalin with Trotsky. Yeah, yeah.
01:30:28 Somewhere out there is like just a picture of like a plate with nothing on it.
01:30:37 Or maybe some peas. Peas to the side.
01:30:42 Well, that's a mystery. It would be so funny if they actually get back to you about that.
01:30:49 I would love it. I would love nothing more. Let me see.
01:30:54 From top results.
01:30:58 Yeah, yeah. A bunch of results about the country turkey at Bernard Matthews. Wait.
01:31:04 Bernard Matthews on Twitter only has 500 followers?
01:31:11 I mean, it's a turkey product. Okay, but it's like a corporation. Okay, it's not even verified.
01:31:19 Oh, I mean, they don't give a shit about Elon Musk. I can respect that.
01:31:22 Wait. Oh, did they get rid of... Well, no, they haven't gotten rid of legacy notifications yet.
01:31:28 I got their Twitter from their website, so it is the correct Twitter.
01:31:32 I mean, they've posted it. Okay, they post like once a year.
01:31:36 They'll see my tweet. I don't know. They'll see it eventually. I maybe.
01:31:42 I don't think it doesn't seem like they maintain a Twitter presence.
01:31:46 The one guy who's in charge of the Twitter will log on to like promote the new Christmas turkey
01:31:51 something or other. Oh my God. And then they'll see my plead.
01:31:56 They'll get excited. They'll finally have someone to talk to about it. Oh, the latest?
01:32:02 Okay, the latest tweet. I can see why they're not on Twitter.
01:32:05 Their latest tweet in January 2021, they brought back turkey twizzlers,
01:32:11 but they're like different. They're like a different recipe. And all the comments are like,
01:32:14 fuck you. We hate the new turkey twizzlers. Like bring back the old recipe, cowards.
01:32:22 Oh, it's sad. Yeah, people are evil. I mean, I get it.
01:32:31 These look completely different. And I yeah, they don't look.
01:32:37 They're probably are worse. They probably are worse. I don't want to I don't want to.
01:32:41 I don't want to Kate for Bernard Matthews food is limited.
01:32:43 No, I don't care either. But I never liked the twizzler. So I could imagine the people just have
01:32:49 rose tinted taste buds for that. Yeah, well, I just think it was the best thing ever when it was
01:32:54 actually just filled with salt and fat and they like that. It was and you were and you were a kid.
01:32:58 It was it was full of salt and grease and you were a kid and times were good.
01:33:03 And you like that. And that's fair enough.
01:33:07 Yeah, great quality, honest prices since 1950.
01:33:12 It's respectable. What a legacy. Oh, man.
01:33:18 Contact. Oh, they got a they got a physical address. I should go see them.
01:33:24 Wow. Yeah, like they they tweet like a couple times a year and all the replies are just like
01:33:30 people that hate them. They just don't like what they're doing. Oh, this is odd or no or no replies
01:33:37 more often at the very bottom first site. They've got navigation. They've got about us terms and
01:33:41 conditions 2021 gender pay report. And then something something slavery and human trafficking
01:33:49 statement 2022 Bernard Matthews. No. Are they gonna say what are they gonna say? Introduction
01:33:56 to the new new and improved Turkey Twizzlers. They're back now with 75% less slave labor.
01:34:03 Yeah, it's basically we're proud of the steps we've taken to combat slavery and human trafficking.
01:34:07 Oh, God. No, our supply chains. We get majority of our protein from UK farmers
01:34:15 with additional supply from Europe, South America and Asia. Okay.
01:34:21 How are you going to human traffic? We remain committed to minimizing the risk of modern slavery
01:34:28 or human trafficking. It's so bad. It's so bad when your press statement has to talk about slavery.
01:34:36 And it's in caps at the bottom of the website. It's very funny. Nothing else is in all caps.
01:34:41 We're so anti slavery guys. I can't believe you think slavery is funny,
01:34:45 Gib. I can't believe you think that's something to laugh about.
01:34:49 Hey, I'm an Amazon author. All right. I think it's funny now. I'm I'm I'm only the only thing I'm
01:34:56 a slave to is the grind is the is the grind is the sigma grind is the rhythm is the rhythm of the
01:35:04 jungle bees. I don't know what that means.
01:35:10 One day, no, I'd like to try an old Turkey Twizzler, but maybe I'll never get the chance.
01:35:15 No, I think they'd gone. Just get a regular Turkey and twizzle it.
01:35:21 Just twizzle that these these these this is this first attempt at recreating a
01:35:27 Twizzler was not even close. I don't know exactly. I don't know what it's missing.
01:35:32 There are there's the main ingredients in a Twizzler are corn syrup, wheat flour, sugar,
01:35:39 and corn starch. And then past that, there's like a couple other things. There's like,
01:35:46 there's palm oil, there's glycerin. There's, you know, flavoring, obviously, citric acid.
01:35:52 So it might be the palm oil that gives it that like
01:35:56 rubbery consistency. I don't I don't know how you get that. Like I'm not I use the
01:36:01 first the four top ingredients, and I didn't get anything like that at all. So I don't know.
01:36:07 I don't even know what's going on there.
01:36:11 It's a smooth like a like a Twizzler is like perfectly smooth surface and it's and it's rubbery.
01:36:16 It's mellow and sweet. And boy.
01:36:22 Well, we got close, but I still want people to send letters, physical letters to Bernard Matthews
01:36:31 to us them where the Turkey 2000s went, bring it back. We need to go back.
01:36:38 The 2000s was the best time because I was small and I didn't have to do anything.
01:36:43 Soy lecithin. Why is there soy lecithin in Twizzlers? That doesn't make any sense.
01:36:48 What? What do they need to emulsify?
01:36:52 What? Explain this to me. Explain this shit to me.
01:36:55 I'm not a Twizzle master. I don't have soy lecithin. You think I do?
01:36:59 You think soy lecithin just grows on trees? I think I have soy lecithin lying around in
01:37:04 this economy. No, I have sunflower lecithin. I have soy like a normal like a normal person.
01:37:08 God. Soy. Maybe we should get mad. Maybe Bernard Matthews should introduce some soy Twizzlers.
01:37:20 What do you think about that? I think it'll be hard for soy on its own to maintain that shape.
01:37:31 I can use the bathroom. Let's break for a minute. Okay.
01:37:34 Okay. It's time to crack into a diet birch beer.
01:37:43 Birch beer. Yeah. Like the wood?
01:37:47 Yeah. It's kind of minty. It's kind of licorice.
01:37:53 It's delicious. It's my favorite. It's delinci. It's a Leonardo delici.
01:37:59 Is it too early to jump into one piece discussion?
01:38:08 I mean, I don't have anything else to talk about by my book. I don't have anything else to talk
01:38:12 about. That's basically what I've been doing. I made my book real and I've been happy.
01:38:21 And now next week, I think it's chapter five. I'm going to start drawing.
01:38:27 Oh, I think I should make also a little video for advertising the book. Maybe.
01:38:36 Oh, yeah. You should announce it on whatever platforms you got.
01:38:42 Yeah. I've sent it to all the discords. So next thing is video.
01:38:48 So. You should definitely make a video announcement on
01:38:54 Hippo, Cread, and Give and Take, I would think. Yeah.
01:39:02 Yeah. Good. That's a good idea. But yeah, one piece. Unless you have anything else to talk about.
01:39:09 Oh.
01:39:12 Trying to freaking feel. Did I take any notes? Did I take any freaking notes on my week?
01:39:21 Hang on. Hang on. PCP weak. Weak notes. What do we got here?
01:39:28 The pretty weak notes. Pretty, pretty weak notes.
01:39:31 Oh, God, I can do my freaking taxes. That's like soon. Fuck.
01:39:41 Okay. That's not a that's not a thing I want to talk about. That's just a thing I have to
01:39:46 be wary of in my life.
01:39:48 Um, PCP topics. No. No, those are notes from last week. Ah, fuck it. Never mind. I'll think
01:40:01 whatever. Let's talk about one piece. Chapter 10 79. No, where's Luffy?
01:40:08 Where's Luffy? Where's Luffy? Not even once did Luffy appear.
01:40:12 Except in the in the opening and the whatever you call the that one page at the beginning.
01:40:19 The title page. Yeah.
01:40:23 Those are great. I don't I never really think about it, but like having a little like the
01:40:27 logo and then a little thing with a chapter name. I don't have chapter names really for
01:40:31 my comics. Maybe I should be nice. Yeah, I think they're nice. I think they're good.
01:40:37 Um, the Vapors has chapter names of all three chapters.
01:40:45 I think it's because I initially drew it and wrote it without the thought of chapters. So
01:40:51 I guess whenever whatever comic I start next, I'll try and do that.
01:40:56 So, uh, yeah, no, what was it? Luffy cover request by Sunflower Shop from Tokyo. Luffy
01:41:07 watering a lion mistaking it for a sunflower. Very, very cool. Very nice. Yeah. So, okay. So we see.
01:41:18 So we see. What's your name? York. I couldn't remember her name all week.
01:41:22 So York is, is got a plan. So she wants to become a Tenri Bito as she conspired with or, you know,
01:41:33 against Vegapunk. And she was the one who gave the orders to all the seraphim
01:41:39 to kill everyone except her and pretend to kill her for to keep her cover pretend to kill her.
01:41:47 It's okay. So she said, don't kill the Stella. Why does she not want to kill the Stella?
01:41:52 Is it because she'll die if Stella dies?
01:41:57 Yeah, I don't know about that. Because like, I think
01:42:01 that she would not have gone through the whole thing of like, yes, marines, yes,
01:42:06 Goro say, I will help you kill Vegapunk because then she'll die.
01:42:11 Yeah. Why, why, like, I think that isn't a thing. I think that there's just like a
01:42:17 give him to us alive stipulation that she's trying to abide by.
01:42:21 I mean, weren't CP zero there to kill him?
01:42:25 So yeah, so the government wants to kill him.
01:42:28 Oh, maybe it's because yeah, the government isn't just after Stella, they're looking to
01:42:34 eliminate her. So that's what she's talking about to these guys. Don't kill Stella.
01:42:39 Maybe she wants to use it him somehow.
01:42:42 Maybe. There must be, there must be some reason. It's either of its,
01:42:49 it, I feel like it might, it might be like if, like there one being and if he dies,
01:42:55 she dies, but it might not be that there might be some other reason.
01:42:58 I do, I do like that the order she gives to, there's an area of the lab, I don't want you to
01:43:05 damage and it's, I don't know what type of what area of the lab, it might be the secret area where
01:43:11 the papa data. No, I think it would be, it's either a place we don't know about yet or
01:43:18 the place where she currently is with her gun and she shot checker in the head.
01:43:22 Oh yeah, the place that she's storing all the agents. I mean, that would be a sense.
01:43:26 Yeah. It's either that or another place. But what I'm, what that means to me is that later,
01:43:33 in order to defeat the stellar, the seraphim, if they stand in that location,
01:43:39 they won't be able to fight back because they don't want to damage anything.
01:43:43 And they'll be like, oh, I realized that you don't want to damage anything.
01:43:46 Now I can kill you. Now I can get you. That's what I think will happen.
01:43:50 That's, that's, yeah, that makes sense. They, I mean, they would then,
01:43:55 I suppose they would just have to engage solely in hand-to-hand combat and not use their,
01:44:00 and not use their beemo. True.
01:44:04 That would just be what the, what they have to do there because those,
01:44:07 it's the laser beams that they fire in like a fraction of a second or like the really
01:44:12 scary part. They can get you from anywhere in like no time at all. Yeah.
01:44:19 So the evacuation of egg head is continuing. And people are getting out since tomorrow is just,
01:44:26 just chilling with wounds. And then we see, we see a ship approaching.
01:44:31 First first first I want to say look at look at this look at kuma's chin
01:44:36 Yeah, since when is his chin like that?
01:44:39 forever
01:44:41 It's like I thought he had like a big. I don't know. I didn't think it was that pointy
01:44:48 Well, maybe this this particular particular one is pointy because it's a robot. Oh
01:44:54 It's like they like enhanced his chin. Yeah, they gave it some armor plating hmm
01:44:58 You know anything is possible science technology share is amazing. What do they what do they think of next? I?
01:45:07 Actually, I actually didn't catch I actually skimmed over this panel this next one that it's blackbeard coming to egghead
01:45:13 I didn't catch that I didn't even notice that that's so bad
01:45:17 Yes, all right. I have a big like
01:45:20 Is he gonna steal the know me know is he gonna steal the know me what if he steals the know me know me know me
01:45:24 Lamal I
01:45:26 Think it's more interesting than just that okay. I have a big reveler
01:45:31 I
01:45:32 Realized something seeing blackbeard here, but let's continue the chapter and I'll tell you afterwards
01:45:36 Maybe he wants to wait. Maybe he wants to infuse himself with green blood. Maybe he wants to steal Lunarian DNA
01:45:44 Maybe maybe he wants
01:45:48 I'll tell you my theory. Okay. Okay. Okay. It'll involve the rest of this chapter sure
01:45:54 So then we switch over to Elbaf with the kid pirates and
01:45:59 a bunch of a bunch of funny-looking weirdo crews and their captains
01:46:05 Who are like shanks aligned?
01:46:08 Mm-hmm, and this is cute. They're they're like kind of pathetic and the reason they're in the shanks the red hair
01:46:15 Pirates grand fleet is because shanks is nice to them and protects them. Yeah, I think it's cute sure
01:46:22 It's different from everyone else
01:46:24 I mean, they might be tough
01:46:28 They might be they look stupid they look stupid, but you know so do so do you and I don't make fun of you
01:46:38 All right, buy my book for reparations everybody I I bought your book so I can
01:46:45 Book so I can cool you stupid and attack you so I can attack you. Yeah
01:46:50 Yes shackles for heckles
01:46:55 We should do another one of those one of these should
01:47:02 We will we will eventually I
01:47:05 Prom maybe to sell maybe to celebrate when the when the perfect comic party is done. Oh, yeah, that'll be nice. Yeah
01:47:13 Actually, yeah, that would be a good thing to stream about when that's out
01:47:16 It's like hey everyone you can go read the the thing and let us know what you think give us feedback or whatever
01:47:20 But okay, we're I'm getting distracted
01:47:22 Yeah, so kid pirates with captain kid and he's like what the fuck
01:47:28 I'll kill him. Yeah, shanks is telling them to retreat. He's gonna go deal with it himself
01:47:34 And he's got all these these
01:47:37 New we haven't seen any of these pirate crews. I don't think yeah, all these new faces. They're all friends with with shanks
01:47:45 It's cool cuz shanks has always felt very isolated when it comes to like
01:47:50 Yonko, yeah, he hasn't felt like the only person we've ever really seen him with is me hawk
01:47:58 And that's it wait
01:48:00 We saw him with me hawk
01:48:02 Yeah, like way a long time ago before
01:48:06 War at marin for it before the time skip
01:48:08 There was like a scene where shanks is just having fun with me hawk and then he's talking about I refuse to believe that
01:48:14 Me hawk would ever have fun under any circumstances. Well, he's he's having a drink
01:48:18 He's doing the Zoro thing where he's having like like quite was he was he drinking?
01:48:23 Quiet yeah quiet fun. Was he drinking a giant flat bowl plate? He wasn't I think he was drawing drink in a normal size
01:48:31 Normal size little hand sake thingy. Oh fair enough, but a shanks was talking about Luffy and
01:48:39 Me hawk was like, oh, I meant Luffy. He's with this cool sword guy Zoro little punk-ass kid
01:48:44 It's like, oh, how's he doing? How's my little boy Luffy doing you saw him and that was just a little scene. Yeah
01:48:52 Good stuff. Good stuff. I
01:48:55 vaguely remember maybe
01:48:57 All right, but so yes all these weirdos work for shanks pretty cool. He's got the fleets
01:49:05 Seriously, he's got he's got boys. He's got boys. I
01:49:09 Think it's cool though that like the fleets notoriously weak and shanks is just so
01:49:14 Intimidating that people don't fuck with that weak fleet anyway. Wait, where do they say that?
01:49:19 I mean kid calls them jokers and says like oh, is this supposed to be no, it's it's when shanks is walking up the
01:49:26 steps to the ship
01:49:29 All right
01:49:31 And it's like the real reason shanks has to deal with them is because the fleet's notoriously weak and it's like
01:49:37 Haha, you're not supposed to say that out loud like everyone knows it. Okay, so I read this. I read this really fast
01:49:42 I didn't I didn't catch that. That's really that is really sweet actually
01:49:46 Yeah, he has a weak fleet because he just takes weak pirates under his wing to protect them
01:49:51 Yeah, and it also makes him appear so much more powerful that he doesn't need a strong fleet and that they're all fine
01:49:59 And happy because of how like his reputation as being strong
01:50:05 Keeps enemies at bay
01:50:07 Which is really and because his fleet is just really big
01:50:11 Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's bigger than any other fleet. Oh, okay
01:50:15 Cuz like big mom has her whole family and stuff and kaito and stuff
01:50:20 But white beard had a huge fleet of like bunches of different captains. Yeah, I don't know if this is bigger or like typical
01:50:28 Mmm, he's got a lot of friends. He's makes a lot of friends that shanks. Hey, I just there's a cute
01:50:34 Girl here. We got to stop everything stop the fucking presses. There's the one that looks kind of like piranha. Yes, the the the
01:50:43 Bargain bin piranha, you know what if I can't get the real one. I'll take this one. I guess I like this one
01:50:50 Yeah, mm-hmm Oda continuing to innovate in the field of women
01:50:57 She's got two algers laws hat. Okay. All right. I'm gonna distract. Yes. So there's yasop
01:51:05 Yes, I can't believe it. I can't believe we're actually seeing yasop in the flesh
01:51:11 Yeah, have we not seen him in like panels with the crew? I don't know if we've
01:51:15 We might have seen him like one other time since like did we did we see him like in the very beginning like in romance dawn?
01:51:23 Oh, of course
01:51:26 But like him multiple times after that. This isn't the first time we've seen him since no
01:51:30 No, I know I know I know we have seen him before but like
01:51:35 It's very rare. He's a very rare yasop appearance. He he he shows up
01:51:40 He's like third or fourth on the list of shanks crew members to draw
01:51:46 Like the big boy and I mean it's it's a
01:51:50 Backman lucky lucky lucky roue Beckman and maybe yasop is third after them. Yeah. Yeah
01:52:01 Anyway, like beard is on the move we know that because we saw him traveling to egghead
01:52:07 and
01:52:09 You know
01:52:10 Shanks is doing his Wikipedia looking. He's looking at the wiki to see what this kid character is all about
01:52:19 And
01:52:21 Kid isn't isn't pulling any punches. He gets his big weapon out. I think we saw that in whole cake when he used it against big mom
01:52:28 I forget exactly
01:52:29 But it's a gun. I'm pretty sure he used a big
01:52:33 gun before
01:52:35 Yeah, probably
01:52:38 And shanks in his super hacky you can see is so far into the future that he's able to respond to this before it can happen
01:52:46 Yeah, which is interesting. What is the name? There's it's
01:52:49 Armament hockey is the one that like you use for attack and defense conquerors hockey is the one that you use to like pass out
01:52:56 Intimidate and what's what's this one called observation hacky observation hockey and it's the same as they have a different name for it
01:53:04 It's skypea. They called it. Was it like?
01:53:08 Yeah, I can't remember
01:53:11 Yeah, it was like wasn't key
01:53:13 No, it was some like multiple syllable world. I can't remember
01:53:19 Rayatsu is the bleach thing
01:53:22 observation hockey
01:53:25 Shandra, is it Shandra? No, that doesn't sound right mantra mantra similar
01:53:32 Mantra. Yeah Shandia or something is like one of the names of the island the kingdom the old kingdom
01:53:41 You're probably right
01:53:43 Okay, so
01:53:45 Where was I? Oh, yeah, he was making the gun
01:53:48 He's making a gun sees the shanks sees the potential future. It's odd cuz like I don't know if this has been shown before
01:53:56 We know that in
01:54:00 In
01:54:01 The battle between kata curry and Luffy Luffy learns some more observation hockey to see things a little earlier than they're gonna happen
01:54:08 So he can react. Yeah, but I don't know whether he can react so fast that he can stop it from happening
01:54:14 I think Shanks is just like a level beyond that. Well, what I mean, what's that? What's the point of?
01:54:20 Have being able to see a little bit into the future if you can't I mean, it isn't like the point that like you can react like attack me
01:54:26 But you block it this time
01:54:28 I think it's just the fact that he can see further into the future than Luffy can sure yeah because he's like this
01:54:35 He sees all of these ships being destroyed, but in the end they don't nothing gets destroyed
01:54:41 Mm-hmm. So it's not even like the weapon went off. So it's like really ahead
01:54:47 Which makes sense. Yeah, yeah observation hockey being more powerful means you can see into the future a little bit. Yeah, definitely
01:54:56 You must be seeing at least like several seconds into the future
01:54:59 Yeah, although he is he is jumping he is pretty quick and he's like
01:55:03 Scrambling because he's worried that he won't get there in time. Mm-hmm. So it's just about to happen
01:55:09 So it might not actually be that far in the future
01:55:11 But anyway, he jumps right into kids face and he slices them with a divine departure
01:55:18 See all okay slices right through the gun. He's cuts cuts the gun right in half
01:55:23 And kid gets whacked does he I don't think he doesn't slice kid in half
01:55:28 He just like cuts him
01:55:30 Yeah, hurt some hurt some
01:55:32 I'm gonna Google this quickly because I think somebody said divine departure was like an attack that gold Roger used
01:55:40 Hmm
01:55:42 And I just want to check that
01:55:47 Whoa his oh my god his conquerors hockey even knocked out killer I
01:55:53 Thought it was saying that like killer got sliced by the sword slash
01:56:00 And I think it's saying the killer got knocked up by the conquerors hockey
01:56:04 It's like wow
01:56:07 Okay, I Google divine departure
01:56:10 One piece Goldie Rogers swordsmanship
01:56:14 Divine departure Goldie Roger launches divine departure Rogers make move name in Japanese is Kamasuri
01:56:28 Okay, Odin was hit by this attack
01:56:32 Yeah, it's one Odin from the from from one oh from one oh back story flashback. Yeah, okay
01:56:40 So yeah, he learned that from Roger and Roger was a swordsman. So yeah makes sense pretty cool
01:56:47 Interesting must must must must be a pretty good technique. I guess
01:56:53 That technique that hi that
01:57:01 We didn't mention we didn't mention that the OVA is out. Oh, yeah, whatever
01:57:06 I
01:57:08 Read listen to the commentary read though buy my book. I don't do that
01:57:14 Become a patron become a patron listen to our we recorded like it's like it's not just we didn't commentate it at real time
01:57:20 We paused it and we discussed the OVA
01:57:23 It's what we see
01:57:27 Yeah, I think it's like a 45 minute video or we just like talk about
01:57:32 What the fuck is going on here?
01:57:34 And that was fun
01:57:36 Yeah, that's on the patreon. Okay, so I
01:57:41 Scrolled ahead a little bit
01:57:43 So shanks defeated kid in one attack
01:57:46 Yeah, or so easily and then they did his crew is like scaled and
01:57:53 They give him the road pornographic rubbings that they got at the end of
01:57:59 one oh
01:58:01 So they had to I think he's he's freaking got him. So I mean
01:58:06 He's got does he have all the
01:58:08 Ponyglyphs that he needs now is that well, all right here. This is part of my my
01:58:13 Realization so I think he has just these two he might have
01:58:18 One of the other two he doesn't have all four because if he has all four he wins and he's found rough tail
01:58:24 Yeah, I love tail. Yeah
01:58:27 Although shanks probably would know where it is. So maybe it moves and that's why you need the
01:58:32 Ponyglyphs. I mean, does does anyone know where it is?
01:58:36 Well, yeah, the people who were on gold rogers crew. Oh
01:58:42 Traveled there. So like silver's Rayleigh would know buggy and shanks
01:58:47 Did the whole crew go there before I don't
01:58:51 Know you might be right actually he was there and like everyone found it
01:58:56 Roger left. So
01:58:59 So, I mean they know
01:59:01 What the one piece is?
01:59:03 Right
01:59:05 You know, I it's confusing. I don't really think
01:59:11 We're supposed to have any understanding of whether or not we know
01:59:17 That they know
01:59:19 Exactly, like maybe the one piece. It's just too many things. It could be that we don't you know
01:59:25 Like why would they want to be the pirate king? Why only now is shanks trying to be the pirate king? Yeah
01:59:30 No, I think what's what's all this stuff about?
01:59:34 Yeah, I don't I'm really I'm kind of lost. I don't I don't really see any reason why shanks
01:59:40 I don't I mean, I don't think any of these people like really need like the title of pirate king like that's not
01:59:47 Important to them. I don't think shanks would care about that
01:59:51 He's gonna go
01:59:53 He's gonna do some shit. I don't know. He must he must be going to Raftel
01:59:57 Because there's something he can do there that he needs to go there
02:00:02 Yeah, whatever whatever the one pieces will enable him to do it
02:00:07 There's so many things that I don't feel like I can even speculate on what one piece is yet
02:00:14 All I know is it made gold Roger laugh and that's funny
02:00:21 Did it did I love one piece so shanks leaves and then
02:00:28 Yeah, Dory and Broggy do their special technique that we saw so long ago that technique
02:00:36 What's the what's the brother sister brother sister? What do you call them?
02:00:40 What do you call your brother sister?
02:00:43 Sis no Nissan Nissan Nissan that technique hi. Yeah, okay
02:00:50 Right they use the Hakoku sovereignty
02:00:54 Yes, if you remember when they met the Dory and Broggy the store has met them on the island with the big
02:01:03 Skeleton of a dinosaur
02:01:06 And that's when Nami got like the the sickness that need they needed to go to Drum Island to get a doctor after that
02:01:13 Yeah, yeah, yeah
02:01:15 They use that to blow a hole through a giant goldfish that was gonna eat the ship
02:01:21 They use this this this yeah, that was like a the final farewell and their weapons broke after that
02:01:28 Because they've been fighting for like a hundred years or something or 50 years is probably thank you for the reminder
02:01:34 Did not remember all that yeah
02:01:36 It's it's such a cool like ah this is like back then it's like whoa giants are so cool
02:01:42 But now it's like wow giants are in the main story. They're still so cool here. They are yeah
02:01:50 Yeah, so
02:01:52 Kid I mean, I don't think kid is dead, but his his fleet
02:01:58 I mean, I guess he just had his one ship and now his ship is just gone
02:02:01 Yeah, his ship his crew his crew and his like pirate ambitions are for the moment like toast
02:02:08 Yeah, this is a little defeated by shanks very easily
02:02:14 LaMalle
02:02:17 now this
02:02:19 learning about
02:02:20 shanks doing this getting the the road ponyglyph rubbings and
02:02:25 Remembering the blackbeard was recently fighting Trafalgar law. This is my realization
02:02:33 Giving at the end of 1.0. They shared road ponyglyphs like the store has the kid pirates and the heart pirates
02:02:40 They shared their road ponyglyphs
02:02:44 So they all have each other's rubbings
02:02:46 They don't have all of each other's they had they shared the ones the ones yeah, and they shared the one from
02:02:53 1.0, I think wait wait that was before big mom
02:02:56 No, no in 1.0. It was after now. You're right
02:03:00 but
02:03:01 Yeah, so that there was one at the very bottom of
02:03:05 1.0 if you remember Niko Robin and Trafalgar law found that and they were being escorted there by the old shogun
02:03:15 And before that Brooke Stahl
02:03:17 This is such a cool move by Brooke. He stole the you got a rubbing of
02:03:23 The one in whole cake when he was captured. Oh
02:03:27 Like he was captured like big mom was like sleeping with him and her bed
02:03:32 It's like oh, you're so cool. You're a little skeleton. He hid the rubbings in his skull
02:03:36 That was the joke like he had he did the rubbings of the ponyglyphs and then he hid them inside his skull
02:03:42 Okay, and so after everything was said and done it was like oh
02:03:46 Shame we couldn't get the ponyglyph and then he was like, oh, look at this
02:03:50 Where is where was the ponyglyph?
02:03:53 If you remember there was a big
02:03:55 In whole cake island
02:03:58 Toto land the kingdom
02:03:59 I can't remember the names of the main places but like yeah, there's a big room with three ponyglyphs
02:04:04 one of them is a road ponyglyph and
02:04:06 They were all in big cages and
02:04:09 Only Brooke was able to get in there and take the the ponyglyph before he got captured and then she put him in
02:04:17 In her bed, okay, I mean I yeah rings about I don't remember the ponyglyph being in big cages
02:04:25 But I do remember that he had it in his skull. So yeah, they were they were in like a lock-and-key sort of vault area
02:04:32 Yeah, okay, so they have the 101
02:04:36 They have big and the whole cake one the whole is that is that all they got?
02:04:40 Yeah, it was the same ones the kid has
02:04:43 Those are the ones the kid has and those the ones that law has
02:04:48 Mm-hmm, and the straw hats have those plus the one that was hidden inside the elephant in zoe
02:04:55 So they have what I don't remember that
02:04:57 At all. I'm so bad. I'm so bad at reading. It's okay. I once I read this chapter
02:05:03 I went I realized this wasn't there one wasn't there one in skypea
02:05:08 No, the one in skypea was not a road it wasn't a road ponyglyph. There was information
02:05:14 But yeah, Nico Robin was like, ah, it's not it's not what I was looking for not void century
02:05:21 Yeah, she's looking for the Rio ponyglyph, which is like the information the big one the key missing link
02:05:28 Is that her big goal wait?
02:05:31 so there's
02:05:33 So if you have the is that one like more important than the road ponyglyphs
02:05:38 The road ponyglyphs there's four of those before the four road ponyglyphs point to Raftel and what is that?
02:05:45 Yeah, Raftel. That's what I said
02:05:47 What is the what is the Rio ponyglyph point the Rio ponyglyph contains the information about the void century?
02:05:54 Okay, so like it's in some ways the main one that will explain everything connect all the dots and the rest of them are either
02:06:05 Like yeah, unimportant or tangentially important or like some of them
02:06:10 She finds lead her to the locations of like the ancient weapons like pluton and Poseidon
02:06:16 Yeah, I think pluton was the one in alabaster
02:06:21 It
02:06:25 I don't remember one of those. I think that was the one I mean Frankie had the plans for Poseidon
02:06:34 Yeah, something like water seven
02:06:37 And I don't know yeah, the blueprints. Yeah, I remember. Yeah, there was one in alabaster that I remember that
02:06:43 Right, okay, okay, so so that's the real ponyglyph. It's not anything to do with the left tail. Okay. I
02:06:50 Okay, so there was a third road ponyglyph in
02:06:53 Zhao but wasn't and that was after whole cake. So no, no, that was before so why don't kid and law have it if they all shared
02:07:00 There and they didn't I don't think the store had shared that one unless they did
02:07:04 I don't think they would I feel like
02:07:07 They'll let me too much cuz it cuz like they fought together as a team
02:07:12 from
02:07:13 Like whole cake. I'm I'm I'm not not even with kid. Just just law
02:07:20 I might be being too like nitpicky here
02:07:23 But like I mean I look at this image and it looks like there are four
02:07:27 documents
02:07:29 It does
02:07:33 It really does but like if they have four then they already have all of them so it's like there's no way this four there
02:07:38 That's why I thought they'd like doubled up and there's two of them
02:07:42 It looks like four, but they could just be folded in a way that makes it look
02:07:48 Like that or maybe or maybe maybe because the the it's a cube so there's
02:07:53 Yeah, there would be multiple sheets. There would be multiple sheets for a single. Yeah, glyph
02:07:59 Yeah, that makes sense as well. I guess I don't know how many kid has I assumed
02:08:03 He would have at least the two right they would have at least the 101
02:08:07 I don't even know whether they would be sharing the the whole cake one as well
02:08:13 But regardless
02:08:15 Well, they say well, they say I mean this translation here says take our load pony glyphs
02:08:19 Implying that there's more than one. Yeah, so they probably have two
02:08:23 Meaning there's two more and I looked at the two more the other one is in zoe
02:08:28 Yeah, and as far as we know that has been safely hidden by the minx
02:08:32 Even Kaido couldn't get in, you know, they didn't give them up
02:08:36 Because remember Rizzo the samurai ninja was hiding in the elephant as well
02:08:41 Right, and they didn't give him up because they're friends and like honorable
02:08:46 doggies
02:08:48 Yes
02:08:51 So that's three the fourth one would have been used to be
02:08:56 Under the sea at Fishman Island and it has been moved by the time the straw hats get there
02:09:02 It is no longer there. It is presumed lost. Nobody knows where it is. At least the wiki doesn't have any information
02:09:08 hmm
02:09:10 So there's three
02:09:11 That the straw hats have they are looking for one more road pony glyph and it's just and we just don't know where it is
02:09:17 We don't know where it is. Damn. Um now first off
02:09:21 The fact that blackbeard is a traveling here
02:09:24 Means that he's probably I think after
02:09:29 Luffy's
02:09:31 Rubbings of the pony glyphs
02:09:33 Because if he's here that probably means he beat law and took his
02:09:38 Ponyglyph rubbings the same way that shanks just beat kid
02:09:42 I think that's a fair assumption to make law might not be in as bad of shape
02:09:48 but I think he probably was defeated and
02:09:51 That's why blackbeard is just traveling. He's just going
02:09:55 That makes a lot of sense. So blackbeard would have I mean at least the wanoglyph
02:10:02 Maybe the the whole cake one
02:10:05 Probably not the the Zhao one
02:10:07 So he might have one to three glyphs already. Yes, but yeah, I mean there's probably some he could still get from Luffy
02:10:17 Um, yeah, I mean
02:10:19 So and he's learned learned the information by fighting law that they were they shared the Ponyglyph rubbings and stuff
02:10:25 So it's like Luffy went this way kid went that way law went this way and I fought law
02:10:34 Not only this there's so many things going on blackbeard is also he has pudding right now in the ship
02:10:42 In the in the brig and
02:10:45 Kobe was captured by blackbeard
02:10:48 Oh garp
02:10:49 Traveled out to find Kobe if you remember I mentioned that a little while ago that the many multiple moving pieces
02:10:55 Garp might be on his way to egghead as well after blackbeard because he's got blackbeard
02:11:01 Yeah, if if blackbeard has Kobe, I think he probably does. I'm not sure. I don't remember seeing him with
02:11:09 pudding or anything
02:11:11 But the idea that garp will be traveling to egghead following blackbeard
02:11:17 um
02:11:19 Is funny because he was supposed to be going to egghead anyway with the other marines and the admirals
02:11:25 Oh as part like along with Kizaru and the
02:11:30 I almost called him Jonathan Joestar Saturn Saturn Saturn regalia or whatever his name is. Yes Saturn Saturn
02:11:38 I
02:11:40 Forget his name completely
02:11:44 Saturn Garcia Jerry Jerry Saturn
02:11:47 Jerry Seinfeld yeah, okay the the Gorose
02:11:52 Gorose gay right so
02:11:55 Yeah, okay, I remember that he was like nah heck those guys
02:11:59 But now he's probably headed the same way. Yep. I think that's that checks a blackbeard blackbeard is on his way
02:12:06 Um Kobe is probably with him and if he is with him garp is on his way
02:12:10 Um garp probably hasn't held meppo with him and that other lady that I forget what her name is
02:12:17 Oh
02:12:19 You mean the other marine to take a place
02:12:23 Not to Shiggy. She's not a smoker and smoker. I don't know he might be with like the fleet which will be fun
02:12:30 So the fleet is coming and they're coming after blackbeard possibly also after garp and
02:12:38 There's all of these pacifista on the islands ready to defend but like blackbeard's got us. He's pretty strong
02:12:46 Yeah, it's quite strong. I can't even really think about what is gonna happen when he arrives
02:12:53 But it's gonna be big. I mean obviously they said it was gonna be big last chapter. It's got like
02:12:57 Yeah, wait, this is gonna be the big incident. Yeah, this is one day from the egghead incident is okay
02:13:04 Blackbeard was part of the crew along with buggy and shanks with the gold gold Rogers crew, right?
02:13:13 No, he was part of whitebeard's crew. Oh
02:13:17 He betrayed whitebeard, which is why ace went over to to get him back because he a blackbeard found
02:13:23 The like the whitebeard crew found the darkness fruit the yomi yomi
02:13:27 I think yeah, and blackbeard stole the guy
02:13:31 Oh, yeah, and stole it and ate it and ran and that's why it's like that's a big crime
02:13:37 You can't do that. I would say so ace went to fight him and that lead led to ace being sent to
02:13:44 The Marines that caused a whole bunch of stuff
02:13:47 I think blackbeard literally did that just so that he could invade in Pell down and recruit all of the biggest guys
02:13:53 Yeah
02:13:54 um
02:13:55 Which worked out well for him
02:13:58 Um, it sure did. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so he was not on the the gold Roger crew. Did he
02:14:05 Okay, do we we don't know anything about him before he was a part of whitebeard's crew though
02:14:10 No, okay, aside from sbs snippets and I haven't read all of those so I don't really know
02:14:16 Yeah, okay. He he once was a boy. I assume he was once a boy
02:14:23 Um, when he was a boy
02:14:25 He was a boy to play down by the sea
02:14:30 You know that song
02:14:32 Yes, okay, just it's munchies favorite. Uh, it's a good it's a good song
02:14:38 captain
02:14:43 Yeah, we don't want to get copyright struck
02:14:46 We don't want the steam power giraffe
02:14:49 Notoriously litigants
02:14:52 A copyright claim in our videos
02:14:56 Where were we?
02:14:57 Okay, so blackbeard, um blackbeard. So blackbeard's doing blackbeard's doing this. So law is possibly defeated
02:15:04 I assume he might not be defeated. He might have just been
02:15:08 like
02:15:10 He might be on his way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He might be following blackbeard
02:15:14 Like we got to get those he like he got knocked around and the pony glyph stuff got stolen if they shared the pony glyphs
02:15:21 Then if blackbeard beat law and got his glyphs, I feel like he wouldn't think he needed luffy's glyphs
02:15:28 Well, this is why I don't think the straw hats shared the zoe one. Okay. Well, but but but but would law know that they
02:15:36 Had more glyphs that they didn't share
02:15:39 Yeah, but like they agreed to share the ones they got as a team
02:15:42 Okay, like fighting the the the emperors and stuff. I see I see
02:15:48 Um, well fair enough. So yeah, okay. It's plausible
02:15:52 I'll need to reread because like it would be pretty pretty
02:15:57 It would be a lot if they all three of them had three of the the road pony glyphs
02:16:03 Yeah, and now blackbeard and shanks
02:16:06 Have three out of four. And so I mean it might be that way. So then it would be like blackbeard has three out of four
02:16:12 Just all there is shanks has three out of four finding the last one would be the only thing left
02:16:17 Shanks has three out of four. Luffy has three out of four and luffy is currently not completely destroyed
02:16:22 So maybe shanks and blackbeard are gonna go after luffy
02:16:26 But the reason I want I'm thinking that luffy has a different one is because that makes him a target
02:16:32 Yeah
02:16:33 Um, which is yeah, why blackbeard would appear because why the hell would blackbeard come to egghead?
02:16:40 Just to fuck him up
02:16:42 it would
02:16:43 Yeah, no, he he
02:16:45 Would make sense if he's got that that extra rubbing and nobody else has it
02:16:50 It's like well, we got to get it from that guy
02:16:53 Yeah, and also I'm thinking this is my theory. I think that the fourth one was stolen or like
02:17:00 removed
02:17:02 From fishman island by shanks the redhead pirates and put on elbaf and under the lock and key of the giants, which is why
02:17:10 um
02:17:12 They'll they'll be an ark in elbaf and usopp with his giant like
02:17:17 Like he's he's he's in with the giants
02:17:20 He's in with dorian broggy and oi mo and kashi and they love him and so
02:17:26 God usopp will get them the fourth road poneglyph
02:17:30 That they need to get to to laugh tail and that'll be like the coolest thing ever
02:17:34 Why um, why do you say that shanks moved the road poneglyph to elbaf?
02:17:40 I may not have been shanks, um, but I just think because he's friendless with the giants and
02:17:47 You know big mom had one
02:17:49 kaito had one
02:17:50 Maybe shanks wanted to keep it from oh
02:17:53 Yeah, yeah, yeah when you say yeah, okay the fact that he's an emperor and the other two emperors had one
02:17:59 actually
02:18:01 did I mean
02:18:02 Because it was relatively recently so you think it wasn't moved within like the last hundred years it was moved
02:18:09 Like it was there until recently. I remember the the in fishman island
02:18:13 King neptune mentions that. Oh, yeah, it used to be here. I don't know where it went
02:18:17 I don't really remember but the the the one in wano has like been there for a long long time
02:18:22 Right. Oh, yeah, because the the the the poneglyphs come from wano and the one
02:18:28 Oh, that's right
02:18:29 But what about okay the one in whole cake? I mean was that moved there by big mom or was that well? Yeah
02:18:36 Well, I I assume. I mean, I don't know. I think just because there's three different
02:18:41 Poneglyphs in the same room that they moved in there
02:18:44 They're very heavy and difficult and impossible to destroy
02:18:48 And damage but they're probably like like light enough that you could move them
02:18:54 Did she just take it? I mean, do you think she like took it from wano because she's
02:18:59 A emperor and just wanted it
02:19:01 I don't know that she got it from wano. I think I mean a lot of
02:19:05 That there's poneglyphs all over the world
02:19:06 So there used to be that the country wasn't closed that wano was a nation that traded with the world and
02:19:13 Well, not necessarily from wano
02:19:16 But I mean you think she just took it wherever it was. She's just like well, I'm the I'm the emperor. So I'm taking it
02:19:21 It's a treasure
02:19:22 Yeah, it's a treasure and it's mine and as as long as I have it under my watch the other guys can't have it like it seems like an obvious
02:19:30 Then I don't know that the thing was in wano. I don't think
02:19:34 But he probably goes to wano to stay there because it's strategic
02:19:39 And there's probably a lot of secrets there anyway, right only the old the old shogun knew about it
02:19:44 And kind of didn't know about it. Okay
02:19:47 Yeah, I mean
02:19:49 So do you think that shanks?
02:19:52 Yeah, in uh, yeah, when you put it like that it could have been shanks and he is an emperor
02:19:57 So like he his status befits
02:20:00 him having one
02:20:02 So I mean that would mean that he must have the rubbing so like
02:20:05 He then would he would only need the zoe
02:20:09 Yeah, which is which means which means shanks is also gonna have to come after luffy which is like
02:20:15 Narratively, yeah, like dramatically the coolest way the things could be going not just that luffy has to fight
02:20:22 Um to win but also to be hunted by everyone
02:20:25 Yeah, at least everyone who is the most powerful people ever. Yeah. Yeah
02:20:30 Um, so I I think what's gonna happen is the big bullshit is gonna happen at egghead, but lbath
02:20:39 Will be the where they get the final roadponic with
02:20:45 I mean, I don't know what will happen in between, but I feel like I feel like that's there
02:20:48 I mean, it just seems like a cool big place for it to be it feels like such big like defenses
02:20:54 It feels like everything is pointing to lbath right now like all like the ohara records are there and you know, I mean
02:21:02 Dory and brogue and shanks is shanks has apparently been there for a while and he's he's been doing something there
02:21:10 And yeah bringing the roadponic lift seems like a reasonable thing. He might have been yeah
02:21:15 Makes a lot of sense and uh the uh would be
02:21:19 As like a place we've been hearing about for like so long it kind of
02:21:24 Works as like this is kind of where it all shakes out. Yeah
02:21:30 uh
02:21:31 I
02:21:33 I think I think that's where they're going right is that the plan
02:21:37 Or do they they don't even know where they're going when they leave egghead
02:21:40 I mean narratively they must they must go to lbath. Surely they must at this point in the story go to lbath
02:21:47 But like they don't know that yet
02:21:50 Uh, yeah, they don't have a plan. Okay
02:21:53 I think I think the way the oda likes to write
02:21:57 His stories is to have like yeah, you know, they're gonna do something but like the way they get there is like
02:22:03 They're not just gonna finish whatever they're doing here and then leave and then just arrive at lbath
02:22:08 I think it's gonna be a different sort of arrival. I mean
02:22:12 Is are they gonna fight shanks in the middle of the ocean on the way there is shanks gonna be coming for them
02:22:18 Is shanks going to appear in this egghead battle?
02:22:22 Because he's he's just you know, he got kid
02:22:27 And she was just leaving the island anyway. He was just saying
02:22:32 Surely he's not close enough to get there by the time the egghead incident happens. Well, here's the thing
02:22:38 Okay, uh, maybe not but here's the thing
02:22:43 They traveled
02:22:45 From wano the three of them all three in different directions
02:22:49 Uh kid went to lbath
02:22:51 Luffy went to egghead
02:22:53 Law went to I think pirate island where blackbird was or was otherwise
02:22:58 I think it must be pirate island because if blackbird was there and he's just left black pirate island then
02:23:05 Those are the three locations. So they're close enough to each other. Should I know what pirate island is?
02:23:10 It's where blackbeard head is giant skull base of operations like wily
02:23:17 Yeah, it looks like a big skull. It's cool. It's just so it's just it's just blackbeard's hideout
02:23:22 Yeah, okay, it's his it's his base and
02:23:25 Yeah, if the three of them left wano at the same time
02:23:28 And arrived at these three different places shanks was on lbath blackbeard is in egghead now and was on pirate island
02:23:36 That must mean that shanks is also close to egghead on the other direction
02:23:42 Or like close enough
02:23:44 He's not around the other side of the world. This is like it could happen
02:23:48 Hmm
02:23:50 And we still don't know what the hell kuma's doing climbing the red line. What's he doing over there?
02:23:56 Haven't seen him in a while. Yeah, I'm still waiting to find out what's in that damn memory paw
02:24:02 It's just a lot of creepypastas
02:24:04 It's just uh, it's actually the entire internet. Uh, that is they're using it to train chat gbt to um
02:24:13 To tell us about turkey twizzlers
02:24:17 Somewhere in there is the secret of the millennium turkey
02:24:22 Um, the turkey that's that that's the that's the one piece. Oh my god, turkey 2000
02:24:28 That's why roger left. It was so fucking stupid
02:24:36 Why would they make it? Why would they make this it would only be relevant for one year
02:24:43 That's what he said they almost went bankrupt because of it. He laughed
02:24:48 slavery
02:24:50 modern day
02:24:53 to human trafficking
02:24:56 Fishman trafficking fishman. Oh, that's fine. I mean that was like what 30 years ago. Fishman didn't have rights then
02:25:03 It's probably normal. I mean, that's that's true. Right didn't like fishman liberation only happened like recently
02:25:10 Yeah, but like
02:25:13 Cool people weren't racist against them. Oh, yeah, I mean sure. Yeah, probably actually you're right
02:25:19 Um, it was just but but it was probably yeah, I mean probably roger would not laugh at it
02:25:24 But it probably was widely practiced
02:25:26 Oh, yeah, yeah
02:25:29 All the characters you like weren't into it, but all of this the dumb citizens who didn't know any better
02:25:34 They were like, yeah, I guess fish people from the black lagoon. They're scary. Yeah, yeah, put them in the water
02:25:40 I put them back. No, this really does really does help the economy. Just keep this guy
02:25:45 Just keep this really strong guy around
02:25:47 Like working for us. Damn
02:25:50 This is great
02:25:51 I love racism
02:25:53 um
02:25:55 Yeah, so
02:25:56 I'm super hype. I'm super hype
02:25:59 About what is going to happen next
02:26:02 Everyone's here
02:26:03 There's so many people already involved in this like scuffle. There's more people coming
02:26:08 Yeah, and now blackbeard's here and garp potentially and potentially shanks and potentially law if he wasn't completely fucking destroyed
02:26:15 Like kid was
02:26:16 Yeah, I'm just gonna say do you think do you think kid is like basically like done?
02:26:22 Or do you think he's gonna do more stuff?
02:26:25 I think he's done in the same way that gecko moria was done
02:26:28 Yeah, like his his thriller bark was destroyed and like hogback and what was the
02:26:35 uh
02:26:36 Pesson what was his name the the invisible man?
02:26:40 pit
02:26:41 Oh, uh
02:26:42 picar
02:26:44 uh
02:26:46 Nah, I don't say I'm right the the leopard
02:26:48 Leopard man. Is he was he a mink?
02:26:51 He may have been part mink, I guess
02:26:54 But like maybe started as a human
02:26:57 um
02:26:58 Either way like hogback left thriller bark with like gecko moria on a little raft
02:27:03 Yeah, so he basically started from square one peron of just fucked off and left
02:27:10 um
02:27:11 And we never saw hogback again, I guess I don't know I think gecko moria was murdered by don flamengo at the war of marion ford
02:27:18 Wait, really?
02:27:20 Yeah, he was just
02:27:22 This is like during the the the the the all of the stuff happening moria was there and then to flamengo just like
02:27:30 Did a little creepy smile and did like a thing
02:27:34 Ha ha I gotcha
02:27:35 But I don't know if he's
02:27:37 dead. I think he's like
02:27:39 really hurt
02:27:41 there's something going on with moria because
02:27:44 There was a there was a thing much later. It wasn't there with like black beards crew
02:27:50 Uh
02:27:52 Yeah, I'd be more like the invisible the invisible man the invisible man went to
02:27:57 Blackbeard and said please give me my captive back. So I guess moria is like a prisoner
02:28:02 I guess blackbeard has a lot of prison people
02:28:06 Yeah
02:28:07 I mean, didn't he he had um bonnie, right? Wasn't bonnie his prisoner?
02:28:13 Bonnie was his prisoner early in the
02:28:16 the uh
02:28:18 Yeah, when the as the time skip was about to happen
02:28:22 Bonnie was in the new world all of the people in the new world except for the store hats were in
02:28:27 Different places training. Yeah, and bonnie was like
02:28:31 Like beaten by by blackbeard
02:28:33 Yeah, but she bounced back I guess
02:28:36 She doesn't really have a crew anymore. No, I mean she was one of the um
02:28:40 Oh, fuck. What are they called the like newest generation?
02:28:44 Is that is that what you call like all the all those like young like up-and-comers that were at uh
02:28:49 At the at the show body that one time. Yeah, I think that they were called the worst generation as in like yeah these youngsters
02:28:56 they're so
02:28:57 Crazy, they're they suck
02:29:00 Is it that they suck or that they're like wild and like and like the wild and and and they don't care about like
02:29:07 um
02:29:08 Like they like I thought I'm yeah, I thought I meant they're like they're real
02:29:13 I thought it meant like they're just they're real like they're
02:29:15 They're they they they fuck shit up. Yeah, they fuck shit up
02:29:18 And they're like toppling the era that came before which was getting old like white beard is getting old
02:29:25 Big mom's getting old everyone's sort of like normal and
02:29:29 And status quo is sort of reigning supreme and the worst generation are coming in
02:29:33 Which does include blackbeard apparently and they're fucking everything up and I mean it includes it includes gang bees
02:29:39 Who looks like older than kaito?
02:29:42 Uh
02:29:44 I don't know. I don't know if he actually is but like he looks older. Yeah, he's in his 40s or something. Yeah
02:29:52 Um
02:29:53 Yeah, yeah, but okay the worst generation the
02:29:56 Didn't wasn't didn't they have a name like like the I want to say they were called like the millennial stars or something
02:30:01 Or now you're thinking of turkey two thousands. I am thinking of turkey two thousands, but are they the
02:30:06 I'm I think they were the millennial say
02:30:09 I thought there was a name for like those there is another name. I can't remember those specific like eight pirates
02:30:15 luffy gang
02:30:17 Diaz drake killer killer
02:30:20 uh hawkins
02:30:22 Fucking up scratchmen up who?
02:30:24 And like bonnie bonnie
02:30:26 Uh rouge the skype or yeah. Yeah. Yeah
02:30:30 That guy's cool
02:30:33 All these guys
02:30:34 All these guys over all those freaking guys go. It's like I guess we've seen a bunch of guys
02:30:39 Diaz was on
02:30:41 Was on was on beast island. I mean kaito. I was part of whatever
02:30:46 He was part of the the troop though
02:30:48 I guess we've seen most of them. I haven't seen orug in a orug in a while
02:30:52 Yeah, apparently he was like defeated by someone
02:30:57 on
02:30:58 On big mom's crew
02:31:00 We didn't hear about anything after that. I would I'm just gonna show up during whole cake
02:31:05 Yeah, I would imagine I would imagine that this
02:31:09 Means for kid that like like he'll still be around and he'll probably still like follow luffy
02:31:14 But he's not like his his ambitions as like one of the contender for pirate king are pretty much done
02:31:20 Like bonnie. Yeah
02:31:22 Unfortunate. Yeah
02:31:25 I wonder I feel I don't think he's gonna suck it up and like be
02:31:30 Part of someone else's grand fleet though that that's sort of
02:31:33 Doesn't seem like he would accept that it doesn't seem like it, but I don't know. I mean what else what else can you do at this point?
02:31:41 I mean, I think he will just refuse. He was completely defeated by kaito and he was imprisoned
02:31:48 Yeah, until he got out and you know, yeah
02:31:52 They they got back together. They got the back gang back together and these tried again
02:31:56 I think then shanks killed him
02:31:58 He's been killed by every he's been he's been owned by every uh yonko that he's met
02:32:04 Well, no, I maybe not big mom
02:32:06 I don't think he's met big mom
02:32:08 Right. Oh, no, no, he made the he made the big gun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he's not big mom
02:32:13 So he's one for two. He's one for three, which is like
02:32:18 I mean he's met luffy
02:32:20 Luffy's and luffy's technically one
02:32:23 We call him one. He hasn't fought luffy since he was called one though, but I mean, I guess you're right
02:32:29 Yeah, they were allies. Yeah, so he hasn't had a battle
02:32:32 Okay, um
02:32:36 Uh, yeah
02:32:38 I mean lots lots to
02:32:40 Take from this chapter kid is I liked it kid isn't kid isn't rough
02:32:44 I mean, he would need he would need a new ship for him to get back on his feet. He would need a new a new ship
02:32:49 Uh, yes, where's he gonna get that?
02:32:52 Wait, why doesn't he just make himself a ship out of freaking magnet metal?
02:32:58 Duh, I guess why not?
02:32:59 Yeah, maybe it's uh, no, it would be buoyant. It would work. He could do it
02:33:04 Maybe it'll just take a lot of his concentration to do that. Yeah, and if he loses his concentration just falls apart
02:33:10 I mean, he's just owned
02:33:12 Uh
02:33:15 Well then now there's a guy now, there's a guy who can get around
02:33:20 If he needs to ship or no ship all he needs is some scrap
02:33:26 Uh
02:33:27 Exciting chapter good stuff. Um, yeah
02:33:32 This this the egghead incident
02:33:35 God, yeah, you're right blackbeard garp those guys. I think you're right. Those guys are definitely
02:33:40 Coming
02:33:43 We didn't like if we didn't we didn't there was no indication before this that blackbeard was on his way, right?
02:33:47 He was like doing something else now to see him here is like
02:33:51 Oh, I think it's
02:33:53 It's because we we saw blackbeard recently and now we see shanks. I'm like, I'm I'm thinking I'm thinking law's fate is the same
02:34:01 Just by this one panel
02:34:03 Is this the implication and that's cool. I think that's pretty cool
02:34:07 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
02:34:09 I I mean, I feel like the fact and putting in shanks are gonna meet if if if this goes if this gets like extended
02:34:16 It's like a big thing. Oda loves law. I don't think that he's gonna have law. Just get get defeated off-screen
02:34:23 No, he wouldn't be defeated off-screen. I don't even think kid is gonna be defeated off-screen, but like
02:34:29 Like kid kid was just forever going kid was just defeated on screen
02:34:33 No, yeah, that's what what I mean is like he's not gonna be out of the story completely
02:34:37 Um, because he's I mean, I mean, no, no, he's a fighter, you know, I'm like Hawkins
02:34:42 We'll definitely continue to see kid and we'll definitely yeah Hawkins is a little weasel
02:34:47 Um, uh, we'll definitely continue to see kid and we'll definitely see law again
02:34:52 But I don't think he's gonna show up and be like, uh, yeah, uh, I lost my lost my my crew lost my ship
02:34:59 I'm just your assistant now
02:35:01 Uh
02:35:03 He he's not he's not gonna lose in a major way off-screen just because Oda just
02:35:10 Like likes him too much, you know, it'll be funny was that and I don't expect it
02:35:15 But what if he ends up on buggy's crew?
02:35:21 Along with me hawk and uh me hawk wait wait no that would be like the perfect fate for like kid and law
02:35:28 and like yeah
02:35:29 Just anyone anyone super strong people and then buggy is like, oh my god, they could kill me in one second
02:35:35 Yeah
02:35:36 Actually, you know what I I said, what's the alternative? Yeah kid joining buggy's crew is like I could I could actually see that happening
02:35:45 um
02:35:47 You might be cut it might be like people like me hawk
02:35:52 People like me hawk and you know what and crocodile now that i'm thinking about it
02:35:57 buggy
02:35:58 might be like a formidable like
02:36:01 Like um penultimate boss for the straw hats. Oh, definitely
02:36:07 Like like especially since me hawk is there for zoro. That's his ultimate fight
02:36:15 I could I could maybe and the thing the thing that's going to be so cool is that like
02:36:19 Buggy has a rapport with Luffy. They could talk in some somewhat equal standing
02:36:26 um
02:36:27 In the in the fact that they have history and then all of like buggy's crew will be like
02:36:31 This guy this guy can talk on equal standing with Luffy the the like the conqueror
02:36:36 Yeah, this this this like super powerful yonko. I mean look buggy's got
02:36:42 credentials he was on
02:36:44 He's been to raftel
02:36:46 He this guy is like a freaking. I know it's it's funny that he's so pathetic. Yeah, this is an accomplished sea
02:36:52 This is an accomplished seaman we're talking about here
02:36:55 It's always going to be so funny
02:36:57 Like the fact that he has that clout and he's
02:37:01 He was at the beginning of stupid clown at the beginning of the manga just fucking around blowing up buildings in small villages
02:37:09 Yeah, yeah doing doing real like petty real like petty pirate shit
02:37:15 um
02:37:16 Yeah, so um
02:37:20 Howard maxing I could I could Howard maxing I could almost see
02:37:24 I could almost foresee like a situation where buggy is like the true actual
02:37:29 Like final threat like the buggy crew is like actually and
02:37:33 Becoming I don't know like even like a bunch of people who are like, oh
02:37:37 We got to kill straw hat and then it's like it's kid. It's it's law. It's me hawk
02:37:42 It's crocodile me hawk was defeated by the straw hats, but like they all have a reason to like fight them
02:37:49 So be like, hmm
02:37:51 Yeah, I'll do that buggy. I agree with this war. Let's go to war with the straw hat pirates. Yeah. Yeah, and uh
02:38:01 Blackbeard joins the straw the buggy crew
02:38:08 Blackbeard's too big for that I think yeah, like I mean blackbeard's too big. He's too. He's he's too big for that
02:38:14 But blackbeard is like the expected final boss
02:38:18 Yeah, in terms of like an an enemy pirate shanks is probably gonna be stronger to fight
02:38:25 But I I've always I've said this before
02:38:28 Then blackbeard, but I think I've said this before I don't know if I've said it on the pcp
02:38:32 I've said on the pod decast I think
02:38:35 um
02:38:36 Maybe not the ultimate fight
02:38:38 But the ultimate competition
02:38:40 And not not the ultimate anything but like one of the major things that will happen between the straw hats
02:38:46 And the red hair pirates is not going to be a combat. It is going to be a davie back fight
02:38:52 It is going to be a davie back fight. Oh, just like with foxy
02:38:56 Yeah, because that is a traditional pirate
02:38:59 Um competition it would be cool to see the davie back fight come back. That'd be interesting
02:39:05 What did that entail? It was like it was the thing where you have to like wager your crewmates against each other
02:39:09 You wager your crewmates against each other. You can wager your flag
02:39:13 And
02:39:14 I don't know. I feel like like the the the the like the gentlemanly pirate, um
02:39:21 Like that's great. I I hope that's true. I hope that happens. Oh my god. That would be a better trade
02:39:27 They should trade just like seeing who could kill each other. Trade jinbei for yassof so usopp can be with stat again
02:39:36 Finally what would happen what would happen if shanks won like the first three and he takes
02:39:41 Like I don't know. I mean that happened with foxy. Yeah
02:39:46 I don't it shouldn't be exactly the same as foxy
02:39:48 But I just like the idea of that being like a thing rather than seeing who can beat the shit out of the air
02:39:53 I'm sorry, but they should trade. They got a they got a trade jinbei trade jinbei for for beck beck beckman be like
02:40:00 Hey beckman, what's your deal? You always got that like gun over your shoulder like tell us about that
02:40:06 Yeah by jinn
02:40:08 Yeah, well, that's not the thing that they can I think they if you lose the game
02:40:13 The other person can take something. It's not like you'd make a trade. No. Yeah, you're right
02:40:17 I mean you could you could potentially wind up in a draw that just ends up you can wage your stuff. Yeah
02:40:24 You can say okay, um
02:40:26 I mean it's like it's like it's like best if I can take these two
02:40:30 Isn't it like best out of three and that's why like they lost they lost a bunch and then they gained some back and stuff
02:40:36 Yeah, and then the foxy agreed to like a big final thing
02:40:41 And then Luffy won and he took
02:40:43 foxy's flag
02:40:45 And he gave him a shit flag
02:40:49 Right
02:40:50 uh
02:40:51 What if shanks steals the straw hats flag? That's probably what shanks would do. It's like i'm taking your flag
02:40:58 How you can no longer use this how could you
02:41:02 How freaking could you it's and Luffy would cry harder than if he was dead
02:41:08 Hey, I feel i'm an idiot. Was that hat was that gold rogers hat did shanks get it from gold roger
02:41:16 shanks got it from gold roger and
02:41:19 I think
02:41:21 there's like some sort of
02:41:24 connection to joyboy maybe
02:41:26 I mean, do you remember in
02:41:28 The emperor of the world in oh, you mean the guy with the eye in the darkness. Yeah, the guy with the eye
02:41:35 he had that that
02:41:37 mysterious compartment in his throne room area
02:41:41 where he was looking at a picture of uh, the
02:41:44 Of Luffy's wanted poster and he sees in this big room a frozen giant straw hat
02:41:51 And we're like what a frozen giant straw hat
02:41:55 It looks it looks frozen. It's it's frozen as in it's just in a really cold room and it looks like this snow
02:42:00 There's a giant straw hat. What? Yeah
02:42:04 um
02:42:06 Why would there be a giant straw hat?
02:42:10 Because the straw hat has symbolic significance
02:42:14 um
02:42:16 Because they're built because they're building a duplicate Luffy but 10 times the size and they had to build a giant hat for him
02:42:24 Well, here's what I this is my assumption after that. I think was
02:42:29 A giant a very significant giant. Maybe the first joy boy or something
02:42:35 um war a straw hat like that
02:42:38 and
02:42:39 um in similar in the way the ace
02:42:42 made a hat
02:42:44 made a little
02:42:46 He made a he made a big hat for a giant
02:42:50 He made a wano hat for for oras
02:42:54 Who did um or oras jr. I think who made these hats?
02:42:59 ace um
02:43:01 Monkey de ace wait wait. Oh no gold de ace wait
02:43:06 Ace made hats
02:43:08 He made a little hat. Um, it was it was uh for oras jr. You remember
02:43:14 Oras from thriller bark sure oras jr. Was friends with ace and ace had gone to wano and learned how to make these hats
02:43:21 And made one for oras jr. So he could keep the rain off him and oras jr
02:43:26 Was the big giant that came to save him at the execution and he held open like a gate or something
02:43:34 And he was probably killed
02:43:37 He's very sad
02:43:38 So the so the art of making these straw hats is like a wano thing
02:43:43 No, the straw the hat that was made is like a traditional like cone shape
02:43:48 Oh, okay. Okay. What i'm thinking is that in a in similar to that
02:43:53 gold roger or
02:43:56 I don't know whoever made the straw hat in the first place
02:44:00 Made that straw hat in a similar way
02:44:03 To another person who had a similar hat. It was sort of like a hat lineage sort of reference. Yeah, sure
02:44:09 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like a hat lineage, you know, like like it's a
02:44:14 It's one of those one of those had lineage situations
02:44:17 Like gold roger had a big friend called big giant joy boy the giant and like he had he wore a straw hat
02:44:24 Gold roger was like, oh, I'll make a hat like that. That's cool
02:44:28 And then he gave it to shanks and then shanks gave it to luffy and then
02:44:31 Ian was like, wait a minute. This straw hat on this boy looks just like this giant straw hat
02:44:36 I have in my throne room secret entrance special room with snow inside and he said, wait a minute
02:44:42 Wait a minute. What does the D stand for?
02:44:45 D's nuts
02:44:47 D's D's hats
02:44:49 D's hats
02:44:51 Um, okay. Yeah, totally forgot about the giant straw hat. That's uh, yeah, okay
02:44:58 Okay, okay. So there was a yeah
02:45:01 Marishwa's straw hat a straw hat is kept in a freezing room in marishwa
02:45:05 It is very large rivaling the size of him
02:45:08 The person the guy wait have we have we seen like how big he is?
02:45:12 I thought we just saw like his eye from the darkness
02:45:15 No, I think in the in the chapter you can see him walking around
02:45:19 You don't see his face. You see him in like far away
02:45:22 You see him his hand holding the the wanted poster and you see a shadowy face eye thing
02:45:30 So we can presume that he's like a normal ish and he's got like a big
02:45:35 Hat oh, he's got like this is oh, yeah, he's got the big like fucking Dark Souls crown
02:45:40 Yeah, right
02:45:43 straw hat
02:45:46 Duh
02:45:48 There's so much like what the fuck to that hat, but I think it's some some simple thing like
02:45:53 Roger liked a guy who had a hat like that and in reference to him
02:45:58 He made an epic reference by making a similar hat or like bought a hat that looked like it
02:46:03 Because he was a big fan. He's like a big nerd and it's like hey, hey, that looks comfortable
02:46:09 That looks like it would keep the sun off me. Yeah, cool
02:46:14 Yeah, I can't imagine that there's like special powers related to it. It's just a hat
02:46:19 But it's it's probably it's probably special
02:46:23 in the way that it's personally special to gold roger
02:46:27 And that's why it started as a gift that he would give to shanks his special boy and shanks gave it to his special boy
02:46:36 Who
02:46:37 Who is him?
02:46:40 Um, as far as we know, he's the ultimate authority and power of the marines and the world government
02:46:46 World government specifically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but like but like who is he?
02:46:51 Um, what's what's what's his freaking deal?
02:46:54 He's like some sort of an emperor king a guy who likes power. Yeah, but like yeah, but like
02:47:00 But like he was elected. Hey, he was elected officially
02:47:04 We've counted the votes twice right
02:47:07 He is
02:47:08 Our guy
02:47:10 Look look at this
02:47:12 He received the pity vote he cornered the corner the pity vote was elected the lord of ghosts. Look at look at his arm
02:47:20 Like look at where his arm is positioned relative to his body
02:47:27 Either his head is
02:47:29 like
02:47:30 The crown is the top of his head or
02:47:34 His head is very weird shape. Yeah, he's got very very long arms
02:47:40 I think the idea is he's got very long arms
02:47:42 I mean, they're long, but it's like he has really long like upper arms, but his forearms like like his
02:47:52 I don't know
02:47:53 I can't really tell like how much of this is head and how much his body
02:47:58 Maybe it's he maybe he's really ugly. Maybe he's a real freak. I mean like that giant thing is not his shoulders
02:48:04 That's the top of his head and that's like hair these proportions. That's his hairdo these proportions
02:48:10 I don't know. I just it looks like he might be some kind of freaking freak
02:48:16 Uh, okay. Here's how they you can sort of see his
02:48:19 So his head is kind of his eyes are kind of up near the top
02:48:26 Of the the lump it's the lump there. Wow, I don't even know
02:48:31 It's a real funny guy. What's going on with this
02:48:35 person
02:48:36 I I cannot wait to see them
02:48:40 I can't wait for him to be very funny looking
02:48:46 What was um the five elders?
02:48:50 Saturn Garcia
02:48:53 I I don't remember but yeah, probably
02:48:55 Uh
02:49:00 Take hit arc
02:49:02 Vegapong j Garcia Saturn j Garcia Saturn. Okay. There we go. Okay. Um boy
02:49:10 What how many fuck it it's it's funny
02:49:16 That it's been so long since we've known about these old men and now
02:49:22 This the first time
02:49:24 One of them is being involved directly. Yeah. Well, did we learn about them?
02:49:28 I mean, we knew about them before fishman island, right? We knew about them a long time. Yeah, the this is like
02:49:36 Pre any's lobby, I think
02:49:38 Yeah, seeing them standing around with their really long legs just in silhouette. Yeah
02:49:45 Uh, oh man
02:49:49 The egghead incident
02:49:51 It's freaking gonna be big
02:49:54 I gotta pee again
02:49:56 Then you want to do voicemails? Yeah, let's do voicemails. All right, it's a
02:50:06 Okay, I'm back
02:50:08 Okay, okay
02:50:10 Voicemails over one piece over no more one piece more like zero pieces
02:50:17 um
02:50:19 First send us a voicemail speakbip.com slash pcb voicemail
02:50:23 Uh first voicemail of the day is called
02:50:27 Three two one go best and worst pcb memory
02:50:32 The the worst pre cb memories. I don't want to think about
02:50:36 Yeah, I I can I complain about I complain about pcp memories all the time
02:50:42 On my stream and elsewhere. So, you know, whatever it's but well trodden ground
02:50:47 I honestly my best pcb memories are like
02:50:54 Like well when when we're hanging out together at a ride con
02:50:59 And I don't know if there's anything specific we're doing is usually in between content that is the most fun
02:51:08 And and and like arriving at the airport and everyone going ah
02:51:11 Pug that that those are fun. Those are fun moments
02:51:15 Yeah, that was all that was always pretty good. Um
02:51:20 Trying to think if there's one I mean it's hard to say I think just one, uh, I mean I liked the the fucking
02:51:28 uh
02:51:30 Going around radcon three house and doing like the gopro stuff
02:51:37 That was really that was fun, but it was also really it was stressful. It was a little stressful. I guess I found I found
02:51:44 Radcon arena quite stressful. I found radcon four more stressful and I did really and it shows because I did really badly at it
02:51:51 Yeah, did you you did the task at stroll lecture during I mean, I oh no, I mean specifically the like the shooting. Oh, oh
02:51:59 Like the the the actual
02:52:02 the shooting, I mean
02:52:04 Yeah, I don't remember
02:52:06 Did very poorly at that. I don't remember thinking
02:52:10 about
02:52:11 Like doing well. It was just like ha ha isn't this stupid
02:52:15 No, I was I was trying to win, but I was not good
02:52:18 It was not good at the skills required. I love playing with toys everybody
02:52:24 I sure sure
02:52:27 Um, I mean, I mean, uh good
02:52:30 I don't know. Yeah, that's just hanging out on streams and stuff. Just uh
02:52:35 Yeah, probably just chilling probably just chilling at the radcons in between
02:52:39 Chill and max in between
02:52:41 relaxing all cool
02:52:43 Yeah, oh, you know, you know what mad bull mad bull was a good one
02:52:48 Oh, yeah, watching that and being and freaking out as we were all watching it together
02:52:54 Available on the plebe and weed blu-ray for limited time stcomics.com slash store.html
02:53:01 out of stock
02:53:03 soon to be out of stock
02:53:05 It's also on it's either jesse's or or
02:53:09 Yeeg studio lamal. It's on one of those channels
02:53:12 I don't
02:53:13 The first episodes are on one of the channels and the like later episodes are on the other channels and I don't remember which is which
02:53:19 Uh
02:53:21 Yeah mad bull is mad bull was really fun. Really hype. We all got fucking we all lost our minds
02:53:26 Oh
02:53:27 Okay, genuinely watching the the the rumbles
02:53:32 I think the one that the one that brunswick won was like I was out of my fucking mind for that one
02:53:38 Uh that oh, that's that's a contender for like hypers
02:53:42 Most fun like single events in mpcp history
02:53:47 That one might be it. I also I have very fond memories of the ape escape. Let's play where me and jesse
02:53:53 Beat ape escape one late at night. Yeah
02:53:58 Yeah, that was fun
02:53:59 I think everyone was there. I think is that's is that still up on the channel?
02:54:04 I think a lot of people have asked about that. That's still up. Isn't it?
02:54:10 I mean, I hope so
02:54:12 I'm pretty sure it's been downloaded because if it went and it did it definitely came back
02:54:18 A bunch of people
02:54:19 um, have yeah a bunch of people have mentioned that to me like a lot of
02:54:24 Old pcb heads seem to like that's their favorite stream. Yeah six years ago four hours 43. This is the the radcon radcon 2
02:54:33 Yeah, I think radcon 2 is my favorite radcon all things considered
02:54:38 um
02:54:40 Yeah
02:54:42 It was there were the expectations were not that high and there was not a lot of like we got to do this
02:54:47 We got to do this. We got to do this
02:54:49 We were all just kind of hanging out
02:54:51 I mean, I guess I guess plebe and weeb was filming
02:54:55 At the time but like I was not really like
02:54:59 I was only occasionally was I actually doing stuff
02:55:03 with it
02:55:04 That was most I mean it was mostly like vik that was like
02:55:07 Uh, like I mean those are like do the setup and stuff
02:55:13 um
02:55:15 It was but like they would be filming episodes in the in the the not the garage the the the weapon room or whatever
02:55:23 And meanwhile the rest of us would just be yeah hanging out and streaming or what making a making a rumble characters in the living room
02:55:30 And that was a lot of fun
02:55:33 Oh
02:55:34 maybe
02:55:36 You know, it's hard to to say a favorite radcon actually. I think radcon 3 had more
02:55:42 enjoyable downtime moments
02:55:45 It did have a lot of that radcon 4 did not have a really nice environment

02:58:36 Yeah, I sure

02:59:21 I I just
02:59:23 Why the fuck did you two release the paradise? Oh, like why did you participate in the paradise?
02:59:31 Right, like I don't did you
02:59:34 Was it ever supposed to be good?
02:59:37 Why is it coming out now?
02:59:39 Like I don't
02:59:40 Because people pay for it in this video. It's a fucking virulent poison. It's like a like a curse
02:59:46 That's that's just a fine wine aspect. All right. I mean, why is it coming out now is because it wasn't done until now
02:59:56 Uh, I mean if the choice, I mean, are you suggesting that we should not have released it?
03:00:00 Like we can't do that like we had to release it because we said in the people pay for it and some people are happy
03:00:07 So, you know, and that means it was worth their money. Even if you know
03:00:13 I mean, I get I get be I totally get and I would agree largely like
03:00:19 This took three years to make like I get it
03:00:23 But like I mean, I'm not embarrassed. I'm not
03:00:26 It's funny to laugh about how embarrassing is I'm not that embarrassed about it. I think it's kind of a funny video
03:00:31 I don't care that I'm in drag or that I was like doing stupid stuff on the beach or pretending to be a girl that lost my top
03:00:38 In the ocean
03:00:39 We thought it was stupid and funny at the same time and I still think that
03:00:45 Yeah, yeah at the time filming it. I was like, this is so stupid. Ha ha lull and then watching it again
03:00:51 I'm like, this is so stupid lull
03:00:53 And it's great

03:01:04 Because the funny video
03:01:07 Okay, I I saw I just I saw a lot of comments. I saw some comments that were like, why would you release this?
03:01:12 And it's like, why wouldn't I why wouldn't we release it?
03:01:16 Maybe maybe they were asking in a tongue-in-cheek way and just didn't come across
03:01:19 I think that's mostly what they're saying. This is like, this is so cringe. How could you live with yourself?
03:01:25 How do you sleep at night? Yeah, that's one of the funny things easily
03:01:28 Simplest simplest thing in the world
03:01:31 On top of uh, how much was it? $15,000

03:07:25 He's getting filthy
03:07:28 All right. Yeah, cool. I guess uh, next one is called an uplifting story. Oh, it's a chat gbt story
03:07:37 starring ben saint
03:07:40 All right, I guess I'll read it
03:07:42 um
03:07:44 Ben saint had always been a bit of a loner
03:07:46 He spent most of his time browsing the internet arguing with strangers about politics and vaping lots of vaping
03:07:51 It was his escape from the mundane reality of his life
03:07:54 But the more he spent time he spent on the internet the more he fell into a spiral of self destructive behavior
03:08:00 The arguments would escalate quickly. He would lash out with insults and threats losing his sense of reason
03:08:04 The cycle would repeat itself over and over leaving him feeling more and more depressed
03:08:09 One day as ben was browsing a forum. He stumbled onto a post that caught his attention
03:08:13 It was from a user named magical gnome 43 who claimed to have the ability to grant wishes
03:08:18 Ben rolled his eyes at the obvious troll but something made him click on the profile anyway
03:08:22 To his surprise the user had left a message to him specifically ben saint
03:08:26 It read I see or in need of some magic meet me in the park tomorrow at noon and I'll show you what I can do
03:08:33 Ben dismissed it as a prank, but he couldn't help feeling curious the next day
03:08:36 He found himself in the park at noon looking around for any signs of a mysterious user suddenly he heard a voice
03:08:42 Hey there, buddy. You must be ben, right?
03:08:44 Then turned around to see a gnome with the face of george w bush smiling up at him
03:08:49 Who are you ben asked trying to keep his cool?
03:08:51 I'm magical gnome 43 of course and I'm here to make our wishes come true
03:08:56 But first let's play a game of jenga ben was taken aback. This was not what he was expecting
03:09:01 But he decided to go along with it
03:09:03 They set up the tower and began playing ben was doing well carefully selecting each block and placing it on top of the tower
03:09:09 Just as he was about to make the final move and win the game
03:09:11 The gnome pulled out a remote control toy plane and flew it straight into the tower knocking it down
03:09:15 ben couldn't believe what he was seeing
03:09:17 Hey, you cheated he yelled at the gnome cheated nonsense the gnome replied grinning
03:09:23 I just used a little bit of magic and now I've shown you that sometimes things don't go as planned
03:09:28 But that doesn't mean you should give up keep playing the game and one day you'll win
03:09:33 Ben was confused, but he couldn't deny that the gnome had made a point
03:09:36 Maybe he was too focused on winning the argument and not focused enough on the process
03:09:40 Maybe he needed to take a step back and try a different approach
03:09:43 As the gnome disappeared into thin air ben realized he felt a sense of hope that he hadn't felt in a long time
03:09:48 He was still struggling with his bad habits, but he was willing to try something new
03:09:51 And who knows maybe there really was a bit of magic in the world after all
03:09:56 Wow
03:09:59 I really learned a lot. Gnomes don't exist
03:10:02 I really learned a lot too bad too bad toy planes and jenga are the only big mints of my imagination
03:10:10 Uh
03:10:12 He's just used a little bit
03:10:15 I like the idea that he's magic example is
03:10:20 Be flying a toy plane into my jenga tower
03:10:25 He's not magic you could have just had that
03:10:28 I just you some and I said you see you see ben
03:10:32 This is the sign that you always just got to keep trying and never give up and one day you'll get one day
03:10:36 You won't get a little toy plane smashing your jenga one day one day it'll pay off and I said hey, yeah
03:10:43 That's true. Actually that isn't that me
03:10:46 I feel feel a lot better about I like the idea as well that
03:10:54 It's it's like chat gbt is like
03:10:56 I don't know what the prompt was
03:10:58 But it's like trying to tell an uplifting story
03:11:01 About how you should not be on twitter so much and it thought I know what this needs a gnome
03:11:08 It needs a little gnome. I didn't meet the looks I didn't mean I met the gnome on a forum
03:11:12 I met the gnome on a forum
03:11:14 What forum am I browsing?
03:11:19 I was thought it was like is it george w bush because bush did 9 11
03:11:23 So he made the plane fly into the tower like is that is that
03:11:27 Is that what it's going for?
03:11:29 Hey, you cheated cheated nonsense. I was just doing a 9 11
03:11:33 Nonsense. I was just uh getting us embroiled in a never-ending war in the middle east
03:11:39 Uh, you sly devil
03:11:42 And I learned nothing
03:11:44 I I
03:11:46 Good thanks for the tail. Uh, did I mention did I talk about how when chat gbt told me about munchy minutes it described
03:11:56 The the thing about kyle and the other guy like how they had to do the fusion dance to merge into the monster
03:12:02 Yeah, and then it gets like oh, yeah, yeah, so then they had to fight against the monster
03:12:06 It's like what are you what like it has no idea what it's talking about
03:12:10 um
03:12:11 Next one is called ben's stream chat
03:12:15 Uh three two one go
03:12:18 Hey ben when are you gonna do face cam also wears munchy
03:12:22 Speaking of munchy, why aren't there any new pcp episodes on spotify?
03:12:27 By the way, you should play one step from edith. Have you heard of it?
03:12:32 It's almost as good as this other game
03:12:35 Rainworld check it out if you like battle network
03:12:38 Anyway, while then you're a vtuber now change sides. I guess
03:12:43 lol
03:12:46 It really do be like that sometimes um
03:12:50 It's like seeing ghosts
03:12:52 If they're they followed me they followed me over from twitch
03:12:57 uh
03:12:58 Just true next one is called the blu-ray question
03:13:03 Uh, wait a sec. Did I download that one? No, I didn't I got download that one next one is called the blu-ray question from
03:13:08 At yes.com three two one go
03:13:13 If you ask me
03:13:15 No one ever does
03:13:18 My only problem with the manifesto
03:13:22 That it doesn't go far enough
03:13:25 I think
03:13:27 If you really want to right the wrongs
03:13:29 of Trixie
03:13:31 Save the pcp brand
03:13:35 You need to record season two
03:13:38 We got to make season two of pleave and the weave it was promised after all god give you up for it
03:13:45 Was that even a tail?
03:13:48 What was what was the pleave and the weave even about?
03:13:51 Also, no, I don't want to do that. Also. No
03:13:55 um
03:13:56 I mean if it was like watching a
03:13:59 Like a whole show of an anime
03:14:01 It probably was I think they watched the first like four episodes. I remember watching the kaon movie when on the episode
03:14:07 I was on but like
03:14:09 Trixie and like Jeff
03:14:12 And jesse were like watching a lot of stuff
03:14:16 They were cramming. I think it was that they watched the first couple episodes and then for the final fantasy one
03:14:21 They had to watch like a couple movies
03:14:24 Um
03:14:25 Yeah, uh, by the way, this guy's referring to my blu-ray manifesto at stcomics.com slash
03:14:32 brm.html
03:14:34 Uh, that's read it. Um
03:14:39 The uh
03:14:41 You know, they tried to um, I don't remember if who told me it was Trixie or jesse or who but they said that like
03:14:48 I think after rad con three
03:14:50 They like like jesse like stayed with Trixie for a while and they like tried to film rad con uh
03:14:57 pleave and weave season two
03:14:59 But they just like gave up and like threw the footage out that they had like recorded. Yeah, I guess they I guess they didn't like it
03:15:05 I remember Trixie saying something like it wasn't very good or
03:15:09 And then did Trixie go to see jesse and they tried to record more there
03:15:14 I vaguely remember. Oh
03:15:16 Maybe it was I
03:15:18 I don't know. I could be misremembering. I thought it was after I thought it was after rad con three
03:15:22 It would have been it would have been like um when Trixie was doing road trips for the first time
03:15:29 And then one of them was jesse to do a bunch of pleave and weave
03:15:32 She did a big loop around the the country and yeah, I think she yeah, maybe it was then actually
03:15:37 It was before may I guess may was right at the end of all that
03:15:42 You mean may the person yes
03:15:44 No, it was not
03:15:45 Oh, you mean it was before like the breakup. No, it was before they had met that there was a road trip that led to
03:15:52 Like one of those stops on that road trip was meeting may the first time you you're totally you're totally you're totally whack
03:15:57 You're totally whack. You're totally wet. You're wiggity whack right now because may Trixie knew may even when she was living at
03:16:04 Digi house and that and like that was like pre rad con three because remember Trixie wouldn't wouldn't not bring may to rad con three
03:16:12 I know that I'm saying that the when
03:16:16 Trixie tried to get
03:16:18 Went to jesse's house to do pleave and weave stuff. I vaguely recall that being like part of that road trip
03:16:24 as as she recalls it Trixie Trixie was with
03:16:28 May
03:16:29 Before I moved out of digi house and that road trip was well after
03:16:35 I had I was gone from there like a digi house wasn't there like a first little road trip and then like other road trips
03:16:45 I don't remember I mean there were I I listened to like uh digi bros and listened to these stories
03:16:53 And that's about all I know so I mean if that if that were true
03:16:57 If that were true then that would mean that like oh, well, I guess that would kind of
03:17:02 So they tried to film it like
03:17:04 Not even that long after like that would have been like pre rad con three. So that would only been like a year
03:17:10 That would only been like a year after
03:17:13 pleave and weave was recorded. Yeah, or like maybe a year and a half
03:17:17 I think there was just it was just wasn't working some reason
03:17:22 I don't know. I can't remember what they said about it
03:17:24 Wasn't wasn't the last episode of pleave and weave not released until after
03:17:29 Radcon three or like it took like almost a year to to get all made
03:17:33 Yeah, it took a while for them all to get edited because
03:17:36 And I mean radcon three was like like only a year involved
03:17:41 Yeah, and because jesse had like his house flood and stuff that delayed him
03:17:45 but but like radcon three was only like a year after radcon two so like
03:17:50 Pleave radcon, I mean, I mean pleave and weave he was jesse was editing rad
03:17:54 pleave and weave like
03:17:56 The whole time so they couldn't have tried to film season two until like that was well
03:18:01 over
03:18:02 I think I mean they could have tried
03:18:05 I think I think that I mean maybe I think the idea was
03:18:09 Radcon two ended but they still needed to film another season of pleave and weave
03:18:13 So Trixie drove to jesse's to try and see if they could do that for a bit
03:18:18 I just I just gotta say I just gotta say
03:18:21 Uh
03:18:24 I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I want to say that if
03:18:27 If if Trixie
03:18:29 Or jesse had been like just more transparent about like the the blu-ray thing and just been like i'm sorry
03:18:37 We fucked up
03:18:39 We we we can't make the blu-rays. We we misallocated the budget. We didn't know what we were doing. We we fucked up
03:18:44 I'm sorry. I probably wouldn't have been that mad about it. I would have been like, okay people make mistakes
03:18:50 What made me upset about it was that they just continued to lie about it and continued to like deflect
03:18:55 And like pretend that it was still happening when it obviously was not if they had just
03:19:00 not lied about it
03:19:02 I would have just let it go. I swear
03:19:05 I mean they could have always in the back of their mind thought we'll get around to it
03:19:09 But I mean it was just to an extent. I think Trixie probably did
03:19:13 But like she wasn't
03:19:15 Yeah
03:19:16 She just wasn't it was it wasn't it was not true. It was just not true
03:19:21 Um, and there were no steps being taken towards her ever doing it and in fact
03:19:27 Steps in the other direction were being actively taken, but like I said, I don't want to dwell on it
03:19:31 But they did want to say that
03:19:33 Yeah, uh next one is another image
03:19:36 It's better not be another fucking cat. I swear to god. It's a different format
03:19:40 Wait, is this is it more than one image or is this just an image?
03:19:44 Okay, me listening to ben and gibb talk about one piece even though I know nothing about it, but it sounds like they're having fun
03:19:50 Oh, yeah, that's great. Thanks. Thanks for enjoying the rambling. That's that's why we're here man. So you can
03:19:59 Do this
03:20:01 Next one
03:20:03 Is uh another imager if you can believe it
03:20:07 Um
03:20:08 NATO, Ukraine. Oh, I saw this one of the great epics of this. Oh this tweet
03:20:14 We are harry potter and william wallis the navi and han solo
03:20:18 We're escaping from shaw shank and blowing up the death star. We are fighting the harkinans and challenging them
03:20:22 I'm glad I don't know what the harkinans are
03:20:25 um
03:20:26 Thanks, thanks for the rocket for the rockets like what what on earth is going on with that whoever
03:20:33 Made that tweet
03:20:35 What is wrong with them?
03:20:36 um
03:20:38 What on I mean, I get going on I I I understand the urge to like I understand the urge to like
03:20:46 Relate, you know a an ongoing political
03:20:50 Thing to you know a pop to pop culture. I understand that impulse
03:20:55 but like
03:20:57 To just
03:20:58 Yeah, I don't know
03:20:59 There's a line and there's a line and you've crossed it here. It's it's just so it's like
03:21:05 When people do this, it's usually pretty cringe, but this doesn't make any sense
03:21:09 This is like ready player one. It is. It's ready player one. Remember harry potter. Remember braveheart. Remember han solo. Remember shaw shank
03:21:17 I do
03:21:19 It's just like all your favorite movies and tv shows
03:21:22 But it's war in real life
03:21:25 The challenge they should have they should have stuck with one thing. They should have just said yeah
03:21:30 Imagine if Putin was Thanos now. Do you see why we gotta send you know what?
03:21:35 You know what that's still not that's still bad. I know it's still bad
03:21:38 But at least it's funny because then you couldn't have like purple
03:21:41 Putin
03:21:43 They should have just posted a picture of Putin edited to look like Thanos to just give him the fan. Yeah
03:21:48 Like that. I don't need to read the people can enjoy even when it's bad
03:21:52 Yeah
03:21:53 Yeah, they should have just had him
03:21:56 they should have just have him
03:21:57 snapping the freaking glove
03:21:59 And uh, the freaking donbas region just turning into into little little turritos
03:22:04 uh, or whatever
03:22:07 The liberated
03:22:09 Thanks for the rockets. Yo, just fucking mentioning han solo. Thanks for all these rockets. It's not even the main guy
03:22:16 He's not even the main guy
03:22:18 Wait, what do you mean? We are haunts
03:22:21 Because because solo a solo story was coming out of han solo memory or whatever
03:22:27 This is so fucking stupid. It doesn't even make sense because han solo is not under attack. Han solo could have
03:22:35 Just left and he decided that he was going to do the right thing and join the conflict. That's that's not the narrative you're trying to
03:22:43 The idea is that is that uh, uh,
03:22:46 Ukraine is the underdog being attacked being bullied by this this greater power. Yeah, it should have been they're they're the rebels
03:22:53 They're the rebels
03:22:54 Yeah, they're the rebels. They're the the luke sky. Han solo is not a rebel until later. So princess lair
03:23:02 Isn't william wallace a real person?
03:23:05 Only like an yeah, honestly comparing compare. Yeah comparing it to william wallace the historical figure who people know from brave heart
03:23:12 Is like perfectly reasonable like that's a they should they should have done that. Yeah
03:23:17 Yeah
03:23:18 That that's no objection. I know william wallace from the age of empires 2 campaign
03:23:23 We play as the scottish
03:23:27 I just know i'm from that movie
03:23:29 Uh, uh next voicemail is called in case you wondered three two one go
03:23:38 I'll never go trans

03:24:07 I just saw the ova and
03:24:10 Okay
03:24:13 I just saw the ova
03:24:19 Sorry all of these losers look like cute girls. Maybe I could
03:24:24 That's what I thought
03:24:26 crossing my arms
03:24:28 I could look that good in a
03:24:30 One-piece swimsuit if I wanted to if I was on a podcast
03:24:36 If I was on a podcast people wouldn't even care what I looked like
03:24:42 Next one is called bge's spicy salts a threat to nate
03:24:47 Oh, no
03:24:49 Wait, I gotta
03:24:50 Did I download the last one? Uh, yes, I did. Let's go download this one. Okay, three two one go
03:25:16 Nails
03:25:30 Oh tow beans tow beans. Yes, I just got it. I figured it out after maybe maybe a third of the way in
03:25:38 Because he was talking about
03:25:39 kittens or something
03:25:41 Uh, I probably probably can't play that because of copyright
03:25:45 Oh, really? Well, it's a song, isn't it?
03:25:49 Unless this person made it it's very good. I but it sounded like they were recording it off their phone from like a thing
03:25:56 Uh, I if it's if it's a
03:25:59 If it's a parody cover, I don't know what the original is
03:26:03 So maybe you're right, but you know cute
03:26:06 Nonetheless, he doesn't love a good tow bean
03:26:10 Nice
03:26:11 Next one, huh? Next one is called, uh, it's an imager
03:26:16 Oh, okay digi brony
03:26:19 Okay, brother and pony. Oh brother and bony
03:26:23 Brother and pony become brony digital and brony becomes digi brony digi brony becomes digi bro
03:26:31 Digi shortened to digi and then what transliterated or whatever into trixie bridgey bro also
03:26:38 It's it's not actually it's not actually how it went
03:26:42 This is this is not quite historical. Yeah, because digi digi the the name digi bro predates digi brony
03:26:48 Yeah, I think digi bro comes first. It was 21st century digital boy
03:26:54 um, yes
03:26:56 Which I which is from that which is from the the the bad religion song
03:27:01 Is it I thought it was like the the the manga
03:27:05 There well there is I mean there is a there's a bad religion song called 21st century digital boy
03:27:15 Oh, you're right, um, what was I thinking of the 21st century boy?
03:27:21 Yeah, um the one by um 20
03:27:24 The one by the guy who did billy bat and the one that he does the the man band guy 20th century boys
03:27:31 Yes
03:27:33 So it was it was
03:27:35 No, I think it's from the song
03:27:37 So 21st century digital boy and then I don't know exactly when that became digi bro
03:27:42 But she shortened it to digi bro. She made it as a
03:27:45 for
03:27:47 Username probably on some thing or forum
03:27:50 Yeah, probably and then uh the other thing I mean correct with ney and digi bro and and digi into digi
03:27:57 But trixie is also short for for Beatrice
03:28:00 So you would have to so it's not actually derived from digi
03:28:04 It's partially derived from digi in that it's also sort of I mean
03:28:08 She told me
03:28:10 Say trixie because it kind of has like the same vowel
03:28:13 Configuration and like it kind. I don't know. I don't know. It's like a weak connection
03:28:17 But it's like there if you want it I guess
03:28:19 Uh, so, you know
03:28:21 It's still it's funny to funny to see the the etymology
03:28:25 Worked out, but it's just missing some links, but it's okay. It's a good it's a good effort and I appreciate
03:28:29 I appreciate the attempt at etymology
03:28:32 And uh, I'd like to see an updated version. Oh
03:28:35 The next image I'm looking at. Okay. Let me let me let me scope it
03:28:44 Was this me at um brony con
03:28:49 Yeah, why are you you look like you're in like a airport
03:28:54 Well, I had the dyed hair
03:28:56 so
03:28:58 It must have been a
03:29:01 I feel like it was a I had that hair at brony con. I think this is a brony con
03:29:06 um
03:29:07 Or it might be
03:29:09 I mean, it's around that time because my hair looks
03:29:12 like that. Oh man
03:29:15 I'm I'm I'm
03:29:17 I'm just
03:29:18 This is not relevant to the meme
03:29:20 I'm distraught that like I'm distraught that my beard is graying so fast. I look at this and I'm like
03:29:24 Oh, I had hardly any grays at all
03:29:27 Uh, it's over. It's over. But uh, like a like a salt and pepper beard looks cool
03:29:33 I know everyone says that everyone says that uh, but they're lying. They're lying through their teeth. They don't know
03:29:38 They don't know the gruesome reality
03:29:41 No
03:29:43 It's fine. Stop lying
03:29:47 Everyone says that until they get some and then they have no it's not cool. It's bad when I start to get white hairs
03:29:52 That'll be funny. That's what you think
03:29:55 Oh, I'll laugh. Oh, no, I'll I'll film myself laughing about it. You think yeah, we'll see
03:30:02 We'll see anyway. Okay. Everyone was mad at me
03:30:06 I mean not people weren't even that mad at me. All right, because of the whole like
03:30:09 Because the whole uh, cheesy said oh andrew callahan asked multiple times for sex
03:30:14 And I said well, that doesn't sound that bad. Yeah, I think it was
03:30:18 What was it being framed as like I would agree that it's harassment
03:30:23 But I think it was framed as it depends on how it's done
03:30:26 And I'm like, okay, there's the words mean different things. I don't know whether it counts as abuse
03:30:32 Technically, it really depends. It's bad. Absolutely is bad. I mean, it's like not a good thing for a person to do
03:30:39 Okay, it's it's at it's at its most benign
03:30:43 It's a it's a bad look and it's and it's annoying and it's embarrassing and like
03:30:47 If it's like over text like it has literally no power to do anything like over text
03:30:53 And like you literally she can literally just stop us replying or block you
03:30:57 So like in that case you just look like a little whiny bitch and and like
03:31:01 You know, it's not good
03:31:03 But whatever in person I can totally imagine
03:31:06 How it's like how you could do it in a way that is pushy
03:31:09 That is, uh, you know potentially even threatening. Yeah, or something like that
03:31:14 so like I get it I
03:31:17 I just as I said as I said at the time
03:31:19 I didn't have all the details and I didn't know the entire context for it
03:31:22 And perhaps if I knew I knew the details and heard like the full report from the the accuser
03:31:27 I'd be like, oh, well, that sounds terrible. That sounds awful
03:31:30 uh
03:31:32 Why are you upset asking again doesn't invalidate your previous lack of information
03:31:35 It's simply a new request after all it is possible that you've changed your mind since my last request for your consent
03:31:39 I will of course respect your answer for the purposes of this limited exchange
03:31:42 The past entered not necessarily inform future
03:31:43 In reality, it is a mark of my deep respect for you that I consider it possible if you'd have undergone the necessary character development
03:31:47 If you've reached my question with a fresh perspective, I think otherwise you deny your life your self interpretation
03:31:51 That's our our tropics takes of a change of character story. I put it to you again. Will you have sex with me my peepees?
03:31:56 I don't know what the next line would have been my peepee so big
03:32:00 My peepee is enormous. I can't
03:32:03 My peepee go poo poo
03:32:06 Gross gross. I hate that. Um, that's I'm gonna throw up. Um, oh god. Oh, I really hate that. That's how that's how we counter it everybody
03:32:18 Yeah, just just have your peepee go poo poo and then they won't want to have sex with you anymore
03:32:23 Uh, next one. Oh wait, uh, did we just look at that one already? Okay. The next one is puppy girls versus cat girls
03:32:31 Three two one go
03:32:34 Really a six hour podcast. Yeah, everyone complained this year. He would have cut the podcast off at its knees
03:32:41 He would have let it die like the hero god that he is
03:32:45 I love nade true. I want you to come back on the pcp nade. Are you a fucking coward?
03:32:51 Why won't you come on? I love you. You power for not, um
03:32:56 recasting or whatever you call it his twitch stream
03:32:59 Um
03:33:00 Rating
03:33:02 Rating you refuse to raid
03:33:04 Refuse to raid in another act of cowardice
03:33:08 They just keep piling up. Sonsu's art of war states that if you don't rate a stream you're a little bitch
03:33:14 That's true. Yeah, I remember that I remember that
03:33:16 um
03:33:18 This wasn't about cut puppy girls or cat girls at all. No
03:33:21 Okay, next one is called
03:33:24 Oh, it's called a hoo boy
03:33:26 Uh three two one go
03:33:28 Can we check in really quick just just for a moment and and confirm that like
03:33:34 When you when you ask for for
03:33:37 Sexual favors over and over again. It doesn't really matter whether or not it's coercive
03:33:43 Uh, because it's still sexual harassment to do that
03:33:48 Like like yeah, I'm very sorry to to bring this up
03:33:52 But like I feel like it's kind of fucked to just leave that at like
03:33:57 Oh, that's kind of annoying, but it's fine. Like no, I do feel like if you do that
03:34:03 um
03:34:04 Kind of like cheesy said you're not uh, you're not accepting
03:34:08 They're like
03:34:10 They're no
03:34:11 So annoying on a normal on a normal basis. You're
03:34:15 Asking over and over again, which is fine over and over
03:34:18 He didn't say over and over like a sexual topic and a sexual advance that has already been rejected
03:34:24 And that's I'm sorry. That's sexual harassment. I don't care that it doesn't immediately violate their consent. It's
03:34:32 It's it's still violating their consent to like having a sexually like
03:34:37 Explosive interaction. It's probably sex. It's probably sexual harassment. It's probably sexual harassment. I think in dms
03:34:44 In in a similar way. I'm sorry. It's fucked. No, it's probably sexual harassment. I would say it is
03:34:51 Uh, you think it is probably about it. Well, I mean, okay, just because the terms are vague like, okay
03:34:58 I cheesy said multiple times and like, okay. Well, how many times?
03:35:02 two times or ten times how long but it elapsed between them, uh
03:35:07 a minute a day a week, uh, you know
03:35:11 Yeah, I it it's probably bad, but like
03:35:14 there's a there's a there's a there
03:35:16 You could I could I could if you I could construct a scenario that the that that the the way it was described to me
03:35:22 Accurately fits that I would not consider sexual harassment necessarily
03:35:27 Uh, but if it's yeah, I mean
03:35:31 Well, like if you make a comment like hey, hey, and then they say no and it's like, oh come on like that
03:35:38 That's not that doesn't go over the line into sexual harassment. That's just like you're say you're you're DMing you're DMing
03:35:44 You're like, hey want to have sex? She says no. He says come on
03:35:48 You you know you want to have sex with me because I'm so sexy. She says no, I don't want to have sex with you. You say please
03:35:54 no
03:35:55 I mean
03:35:56 It's a little needy
03:36:00 It's needy and pathetic
03:36:01 I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't even call it. I mean, it's a proposition
03:36:05 And maybe you and maybe you should have dropped it after the first one or two
03:36:09 But is it what would I call that sexual harassment necessarily? What's the number?
03:36:12 I would say I would say probably pass two. Yeah, I would say pass two is sexual harassment
03:36:18 You get you get one extra little little pathetic
03:36:22 attempt
03:36:24 To you you get one attempt to save you get it you get a savings
03:36:27 But what if she says no, but in like a but in like I'm just kidding kind of way when she goes no
03:36:33 No, come on. No, we can't do that. No, but it's like she doesn't really mean it though. Oh, that's you know
03:36:39 You know
03:36:42 Uh, women women are all women are always saying no, but they don't actually mean it. You know what I'm saying
03:36:47 You know what I'm talking about? I know. I don't know what you mean. Yeah, everybody. Everybody knows what I'm talking about
03:36:53 Everybody knows I'm talking about. I'm just kidding. By the way, don't quote me. Do not definitely don't quote that out of context
03:36:58 Definitely don't tell anyone don't let anybody know that I said that under any circumstances
03:37:03 um
03:37:05 No, everyone everyone her rang me and made fun of me
03:37:09 Yeah, it's bad. Yeah, it's it's in most cases would probably be sexual harassment in some cases
03:37:14 It could be done in a coercive way. Yeah. Yeah, you're you happy. Are you all fucking happy? You're never happy jackals
03:37:24 I mean they all sound pretty happy when they're chuckling as they say these things like
03:37:29 Did you I mean obviously
03:37:32 I don't like the chuckling. I think it is those chuckles of contempt
03:37:37 Those are chuckles of contempt even when you're right chuckling when you say are you sure?
03:37:42 It's unacceptable
03:37:44 I would I would consider chuckling to be a violation of my consent because I didn't you didn't ask me if you could do that
03:37:50 Isn't there somebody forgot to ask
03:37:54 Me just doing anything
03:37:56 They should ask
03:37:57 They they would they ought to ask me multiple times if they're allowed to chuckle
03:38:03 So that I can say no every time
03:38:07 Okay, next voicemail. Yes, it's called kill the intrusive thought three two one go
03:38:12 Oh
03:38:13 You know I've been having this intrusive thought lately and I've already watched the show
03:38:18 And you're talking about one piece. I'm like they should have me on the show
03:38:23 They should have a random person on the show to be their facts checker and to answer all your questions
03:38:29 Give those to too many facts. Please kill this intrusive thought for me
03:38:33 Please do it
03:38:35 I'm being cringe. I'll kill you. Um, I get it though
03:38:39 I get it. I mean, yeah facts is
03:38:43 it's if it were
03:38:45 Like a proper like attempt at being like this is a podcast about one piece
03:38:51 Fact checking is probably important
03:38:53 I didn't need to do that for the podcast because Nate would have facts
03:38:56 But then again, he would also make things up and get things wrong sometimes
03:39:01 He would have he would have I've heard people say that he remembers things wrong. He remembers things wrong
03:39:05 I mean, I know he has like a tendency to like
03:39:08 Say something and not realize he said it incorrectly
03:39:11 But if I don't know what the truth is and I don't check him on that
03:39:14 See, so that's fun. This is why I'm the superior one piece because I don't know anything
03:39:19 You listen to the listen to the last hit. I don't remember shit about what happened
03:39:23 I'm like a little baby with a fresh a freshly laundered brain just like
03:39:28 What now wait, there's a wait there wait the the minks live on a on an elephant. Oh, yeah, I think I remember an elephant
03:39:36 Yeah
03:39:37 That's the name of the gun
03:39:40 Isn't it zao
03:39:42 Zo is the island
03:39:44 Zashina is the name of the elephant
03:39:46 Oh
03:39:47 I think there's a I thought the elephant was the island
03:39:51 Don't the minks live on the elephant
03:39:53 They live on the island on the elephant
03:39:56 Look what?
03:39:57 No, the island
03:39:59 I thought the elephant was just walking through zuneshia not zashina zuneshia is a big fucking elephant
03:40:06 Zuneshia is a big and he has carries the island of zoe on its back. There you go. Oh
03:40:12 Oh, all right. Okay
03:40:16 Gotcha see I see I've got the facts
03:40:19 I don't even I don't even pretend to know what I'm talking about now
03:40:22 But now I'm in the position of being the nate where I think sometimes I have the facts and maybe I'm getting things wrong
03:40:28 And I'm just saying and you're being like who might believe it. That sounds that sounds reasonable
03:40:33 It turns out everything I've said this whole episode has been wrong. You've made you've been making it up
03:40:38 There is no there is no treasure tree atom. That was never a thing that existed
