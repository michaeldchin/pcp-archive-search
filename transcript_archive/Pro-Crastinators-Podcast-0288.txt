00:00:00 I want to bless that guy. That's son of all things.
00:00:05 Son of all things. Son of all things.
00:00:10 Son of all things.
00:00:15 Aw, welcome to the Pro Crastinators podcast. Where are the reason people are dying?
00:00:20 Hello, I'm the Pro Crastinators. That's true.
00:00:23 That's the phrase we use every time.
00:00:25 Every single time we say that. And every single time it gets funny.
00:00:29 It gets truer I'm opening up my speak pipe so that when we get to that part of the show we will have
00:00:37 Which is now let's go straight to voicemail honestly, we probably should
00:00:43 Know I have you I do I do have a few things to talk about this time. I have I was I was unprepared
00:00:48 I didn't think to like write down notes this time. I did at least one
00:00:53 I have I have three notes today. I I have three notes
00:01:00 Usually these stretch out for a long time
00:01:02 Well, we want to lead off
00:01:04 with something yeah, okay, so I
00:01:09 Have been playing and only a little bit because it's very new and I haven't really had a chance to use it yet
00:01:15 And have you heard of Pikmin bloom?
00:01:19 Is that the new Pikmin it is a Pikmin Pokemon go clone
00:01:25 Made by the made by Niantic and it is I saw it involves
00:01:30 Walking around Google's street map view, but with Pikmin involved instead of Pokemon and it's it's really cool
00:01:37 Actually, because it's it's not about
00:01:40 Going and finding rare Pokemon although there are Pikmin that are rare and all that they got a cell
00:01:48 bullshit like
00:01:49 things that they have they're all like coin store and all that but
00:01:54 The draw is not about like going and exploring and spinning Pokestops and gyms and stuff. It's just walking because it counts your steps
00:02:01 It's a step counting game
00:02:03 so it just encourages you to go on walks to make flowers bloom and
00:02:08 Pikmin and you just have a bunch of Pikmin following you around on the map. I did see some people talking about it on Twitter I
00:02:18 Mean I have not played Pokemon go in a long time because of my shitty phone
00:02:23 Which I definitely should have switched to the new phone that crack gave me by now. I just haven't done it
00:02:30 Phone yeah crackers gave me if he had a bunch of phones
00:02:34 He said that and he just was like here. This one's this one will work better than yours. He's gave me one
00:02:39 Why I have not switched yet
00:02:44 So I don't know if it's true, but it probably is
00:02:48 Yes, it's it's cool because it's like
00:02:51 You don't have to actively actively play it. It's basically
00:02:55 The egg hatching, you know bunch of steps in a Pokemon go you hatch eggs by walking large amounts of distance
00:03:02 You don't have to have your phone open and an active so you can it uses like the Google fit like step counter
00:03:10 So you have to download Google fit it'll count your steps when the phone is just you know on standby and
00:03:16 Then you open it up after you've had like a walk in the park or you're just going around to a place
00:03:24 You know what just going anywhere and then you say oh look at all the new like nectar
00:03:30 I got and then your Pikmin you can feed them near the flowers bloom
00:03:35 And you just have a bunch of Pikmin and you they use like the Nintendo me
00:03:40 You know avatar this link to your Nintendo account or you don't have to link it, but I did
00:03:45 And it's your it's your me. It's your me. So it's much more customizable than Pokemon go, which sucks
00:03:52 To be to be frank does suck the customization sucks
00:03:57 You can have one haircut hair style. That's it stupid, but the me's are looks like me
00:04:05 It's it's really me for real and
00:04:08 and on the cutest thing is
00:04:11 You can use these petals that you get from your Pikmin and
00:04:17 You like activate them and then flowers start blooming where you walk and the point of that is to
00:04:24 Lay flowers so that you can look at where you've been but also everybody in the game sees the same flowers
00:04:31 so if
00:04:33 You've left a trail of flowers people can see that trail
00:04:37 If they're in the same area, it's just sort of like slowly the world is being
00:04:42 covered in flowers and nice things and you do that to like make larger
00:04:48 Like flowers bloom in place of like poker stops
00:04:51 There's like these big buds and the more flowers that are grown around it the more they grow and then like items can fall off of them
00:04:58 And your Pikmin can just pick them up and bring them to you and it's really like casual you just sort of
00:05:03 You see cute things happen every so often and you just need to go for a walk
00:05:07 It's not not an intensive annoying min maxi game like Pokemon is sometimes
00:05:13 And I like it. I like just you don't really need to do anything and it's cute
00:05:20 I love a game where I don't have to do anything all you need to do is go outside and that's a good thing
00:05:26 Even though it is a good thing. That is a good. It's it's getting old. It's getting a little bit cold for going outside
00:05:32 Gonna take my I can take my air conditioner out of my window. I keep telling myself. It's fine
00:05:38 And I don't have to move it. No, I'm sure it's not leaking cold air or anything, but it's it's it is it is
00:05:49 I have a
00:05:51 I still don't go I'll go out a little bit more often these days
00:05:54 I still don't go out enough. I don't go on like walks anymore. I guess I probably should I should I need to as well
00:06:00 Yeah, it's just one of those like oh, but I like being fat and lazy. That's way funner. That's true. That's true
00:06:16 Speaking of being fat and lazy
00:06:18 My lifts are come my lifts are coming along. I'm strong now
00:06:22 I'm my lower back is sore. I my dead my last deadlift
00:06:27 I think I pushed it a little far my my form was bad and I was like no
00:06:30 So I went I went down five pounds and I deadlifted again the other day and my form was good
00:06:35 I was like yes success, but my lower back is really sore. I think it's sore in the good way
00:06:40 I think it's sore like it was a good workout and not like my bones have incurred some damage my my
00:06:47 connective tissues
00:06:50 Don't worry about that the more you break the bones the stronger they become they grow back stronger. They grow back stronger
00:06:56 Yes, that's right. That's right
00:06:58 Thankfully, thankfully, yes
00:07:02 Just hit your head against a fucking brick wall and then you'll be you'll have like a shield your brain
00:07:07 Brain damage and your brain will grow back stronger the second time
00:07:12 Not smarter just stronger
00:07:14 Mass not definitely not smarter. Yes, it will be tougher
00:07:19 It will be scar tissue to resist a second attack. It won't be able to think though
00:07:26 Man, I saw a I saw like a gif or I saw a video of
00:07:33 neurons on like a Petri dish
00:07:35 It was like a microscope
00:07:37 footage of
00:07:38 Neuron, I mean the caption said it was neurons attempting to make connections and the neurons were like
00:07:44 They were literally like like swirling around like moving around and like extending their little cell
00:07:50 Arms and like reaching out like trying to grab each other
00:07:54 And I was like rose but cool
00:07:56 It felt and I mean it it felt like the way it feels when you're trying to think of
00:08:02 Something that you forgot and you're like trying to reach like oh, what was it? What was it?
00:08:06 Uh, it's and it's like it's little cell arms like reaching like shooting out like trying to
00:08:12 Grab each other and make connections between each other. I was like they stretched before I was like I was like yep
00:08:19 That's what it's like. That's how it is in there
00:08:24 It was pretty it's kind of gross a little horrifying like most things are
00:08:29 Hmm, I don't like to imagine my brain filled with tiny little squirming arms. No
00:08:36 I like to imagine my brain as a corridor with doors in it and you go in the door and it's like hey, I remember that
00:08:44 No false I
00:08:50 Shit shit. Oh fuck that was gonna make me
00:08:53 Say something, but what was it? Oh, no help and neurons you saw
00:08:59 Brains fired when you saw something
00:09:01 Memories. Oh, no, I can't remember
00:09:05 I literally have to squeeze out my nasty little cell arms and grab more of them
00:09:13 Come on neurons a glomerate
00:09:15 Think think
00:09:21 Think think about what you're trying to do to me
00:09:24 That's the if you watched a Sonichu lecture, too
00:09:28 You know that that is the official theme
00:09:31 Anthem of quickville is think by Aretha Franklin. Oh
00:09:34 She she wrote that song after looking after looking in a microscope and seeing some neurons squirming around and thinking yeah
00:09:41 That is what it's like. I want to write a song about it
00:09:46 Uh
00:09:47 Think think about how you're just a collection of neurons. I
00:09:54 Was watching I thought love was real but actually oh, it's just a chemical reaction bitch
00:10:01 rick and mortade
00:10:04 speaking of
00:10:05 There was a I was I was catching up on the anamorphic time podcast. I'm a few episodes behind
00:10:12 but I watched one and
00:10:15 Think it was Tyler of Nate and Tyler. I think it was Tyler that said something about like
00:10:20 The human the human body is like it's like so much of it is actually just bacteria
00:10:26 Like we're basically just a scaffolding for bacteria to live in
00:10:31 I know that's true in the in the intestines kind of yeah, probably not in the whole body
00:10:37 Equally, I don't think that's true in the brain
00:10:40 fortunately
00:10:43 Yeah, and the gut probably
00:10:45 There oh, um
00:10:47 This is interesting
00:10:51 Viewer a viewer of the show a watcher of the show named Bob Disgaea was on a
00:10:58 Was on an episode of anamorphic time and I think is going I think it's the next episode that's coming out soon
00:11:05 I think
00:11:07 and
00:11:08 apparently he
00:11:10 He he he messaged me on discord and he told me about it
00:11:14 And he said that he peppered in a bunch of like PCP memes and references or something and I just thought that was pretty funny
00:11:22 It's um, it's a weird epic. It is epic. I can't wait for that episode is not out yet
00:11:28 But I think it's coming. I got a catch-up on the show so I can be
00:11:33 Contemporary when it what even is a PCP meme. I'm trying like well, I know I know he drops at least one
00:11:40 patreon.com slash
00:11:42 It's a great PCP me I
00:11:45 He didn't specify. He's just kind of a vaguely alluded to that he made a bunch of like
00:11:50 He he made some references and I don't know what they were but I'm curious. Um, I
00:11:56 I um
00:11:58 The the wait shit. Oh god, I'm reaching again my neurons
00:12:05 What what's happening to me today
00:12:07 Um
00:12:08 He it was again, it was about mine is a petri dish
00:12:13 Wait, it was it was about
00:12:14 It's it was literally on this subject. It was about bob disgaea
00:12:18 It was about anamorphon time
00:12:21 Oh, um, I don't know if this is a coincidence or not, but
00:12:25 The anamorphon time guys have a guy
00:12:29 They have a guy who I think hooks them up with like interesting animal facts. I think that's what this guy's job is
00:12:35 He sends them like the the most interesting like weird animal trivia for them to discuss and
00:12:41 That guy's name that guy is a guy who I knew he used to be
00:12:45 In my old discord not on the current iteration of my discord
00:12:49 But in the previous iteration from a few years ago
00:12:52 That guy's name is divine soup can
00:12:55 And like I was listening to anamorphon time and they're like, yeah our gay our guy divine soup can and I'm just like
00:13:02 I think I was like what?
00:13:04 I think I recognize that name. Yeah
00:13:07 Wacky what I guess I guess it's a coincidence that it's just a guy who
00:13:12 Used to be around
00:13:15 And now he's over there people on the internet. Yeah exist after I stopped looking at them. I wish they would not
00:13:22 Actually
00:13:25 As a matter of fact
00:13:28 Speaking of well, I was gonna say speaking of whatever you were speaking about but it's got nothing to do with that
00:13:35 um
00:13:36 Picross right?
00:13:39 I love Picross. It is my my go-to
00:13:43 brain game
00:13:44 time waster
00:13:46 And I've been playing the steam game of Picross
00:13:50 And I've been slowly completing every single
00:13:53 Puzzle that they have and I'm now up to like the very last one which is 40 by 40
00:13:59 Which is a very big grid
00:14:02 And there's they're like the the method of like figuring it out works every time
00:14:07 So I don't really need to think that much. I just need to count
00:14:11 From left to right up to down
00:14:13 Filling in the squares and it's taking over my life
00:14:16 I feel like after I completed this entire steam game of Picross
00:14:20 Pages and pages and pages of puzzles
00:14:23 I'll be like well now what do I have to buy another steam game?
00:14:27 Do I have to buy more do I have to
00:14:30 There can never be a pick. You must you must complete you must consume
00:14:34 You must consume more content is what you must do at that point. Oh, I don't uh, it's it's too much
00:14:41 It's it's like yesterday
00:14:44 I I was I had red letter media huff in the bag in in the background and you know
00:14:51 At the point where you're like rewatching half in the bag because you've already rewatched all of the best of the worst
00:14:57 That you've been doing too much youtube
00:15:00 Yeah, and I'm like real listening to that. I'm just doing Picross all day and I was like, oh wait
00:15:05 There was a day here and I it's gone
00:15:09 I've been I should stop but it's just so
00:15:12 Like you click on the boxes and you make a picture
00:15:16 My most my most recent iteration of that youtube phenomenon is that I've been
00:15:21 You know, I I like a bunch of to sneakers videos
00:15:25 But I haven't played most of the games. He's talking about well
00:15:27 I've I'm I'm down bad for youtube content to the extent that I've I've was listening to his uh
00:15:33 Yakuza videos even though I don't play yakuza and I don't know what he's talking about
00:15:39 But I got to listen to something
00:15:42 uh
00:15:43 It sucks. I can't help I can't help
00:15:47 feeling
00:15:48 Like I've got to do something about this
00:15:51 But when I get when I sit down, I'm like, uh, you know what?
00:15:54 I feel like just having some random crap in the background
00:15:57 Yeah and doing Picross again, you know
00:16:00 You know what I actually rediscovered something that I this is not the first time I figured this out
00:16:05 But I remembered that actually I kind of work better
00:16:09 with music on um
00:16:12 It okay, it has to be like
00:16:14 It has to be the right kind of music. It has to be like energetic music
00:16:17 I have to it has to I have to be vibing with it
00:16:20 and then I can really like
00:16:22 Help me stay focused on the task at hand and I I've been putting on some some
00:16:28 Some tunes uh this week while I was working while I was cranking out uh phantoms revenge assets
00:16:35 And I think it probably helped me focus better on that
00:16:38 Um, but the thing about that is that there's very little music that like I like and that like I
00:16:45 I'm excited to listen to and that I
00:16:48 Vibe with in that way
00:16:50 Um, and I so I'm like
00:16:52 I'll like pick a song and I'm like, yeah, this song's good
00:16:54 And I'll listen to it on loop for a while and then I'll get bored of it and I'll be like well
00:16:59 Fuck now what there's
00:17:01 There's nothing else
00:17:04 Um
00:17:05 Yeah, there's a fine line for me with with music
00:17:09 Between being hype and being like, yeah, I love this and being too hype that I
00:17:15 I take my hands of my keyboard and mouse and I start like miming the drums
00:17:19 And just really my head around I kind of help. I love miming drums. That's funny. That never that never happens to me
00:17:27 I get too into it. I it's
00:17:30 Just musician things, you know
00:17:32 I guess so I guess so
00:17:34 Um, interesting to like vulfpeck is like it's so fucking good, but I can't
00:17:40 Work to it. No, that happens to me if if I'm if a if a video essay or some video youtube video is on
00:17:46 And I get too interested in it. I'll like start looking at it instead of my work
00:17:50 With music. I'm never like, oh, I gotta like
00:17:53 I gotta like pay attention to this. I gotta drop what I'm doing and pay attention. Yeah, I mean, that's why
00:17:59 Half in the bag and and best of the worst is good because it's just sort of like
00:18:03 Some noise. I've seen these videos before and occasionally rich heavens laugh is so loud and I'm like, oh, yeah
00:18:09 I'm no
00:18:11 There they are
00:18:13 But I should be doing work to that and I'm not I'm just playing pick-russ again like a fucking rube
00:18:19 Although at the moment
00:18:21 like
00:18:22 Well, I said last week I'm working on secret project stuff
00:18:26 and I
00:18:27 I'm still sort of doing that, but I'm sort of like
00:18:31 Going back to my computer at the end of working on that
00:18:36 secret project
00:18:37 And doing the the red letter media. I mean, you can't I mean, you can't work on it like 24 hours a day
00:18:43 No, no, yeah
00:18:44 So while I'm working on it, it's not really the sort of thing I could do with uh sound
00:18:49 Yeah, like in distractions, but whatever
00:18:53 With with that I can I can um, I can draw
00:18:57 I can draw with music
00:19:00 Yeah, I can't like do I can't like
00:19:04 I can't really program with music and I definitely can't program with like
00:19:09 a like talky youtube video
00:19:12 um
00:19:14 Drawing I can do a bit by sort of uh reflex or a bit by sort of like
00:19:20 I don't really have to think about it too. I can just kind of do it by feel. I don't have to concentrate on it that much
00:19:25 um
00:19:26 Um, well, I mean it depends what it is
00:19:30 um
00:19:31 I mean sketching out like a blocking out a page of a comic
00:19:36 Is more intensive than line art. Yes
00:19:39 You're just filling in the things and making each line look good with other lines. You don't really need to think about
00:19:46 the entire
00:19:47 Feeling of the page because you figured that out already with the sketch. I was oh, man
00:19:52 it felt
00:19:54 amazing I had a
00:19:56 I had a euphoric moment
00:19:58 A few euphoric moments this week actually is when I was working. I was working on
00:20:04 I was working on actually shit. It might have been last week. It's sort of blending together
00:20:08 Um, but I was I was working on fans of revenge. I was drawing some assets and I I don't want to say
00:20:13 It's be too specific for spoiler reasons, but I had to
00:20:17 draw spray because the butler did I had to draw a
00:20:21 face I had to draw a face
00:20:24 that was
00:20:25 screaming screaming with rage and I
00:20:29 was so I like
00:20:31 I I sketched it and then I like moved it to the my little like
00:20:35 Sprite template and then I like sprighted over it and I like I added the details and the whole time I'm drawing this face
00:20:41 I had music on
00:20:43 I was vibing with it and I'm drawing this this this rage face and I'm
00:20:47 And I was making the face. I'm like, I'm twisting up my own face and rage is going like
00:20:54 Like making the sound did I talk about this last week?
00:20:57 I think you did talk about because I remember I remember screaming into the microphone last week
00:21:01 I just it felt so good
00:21:04 It felt so fucking good
00:21:06 Being enraged
00:21:08 Uh, okay. Sorry. Sorry to bring that up again. Uh, listen, we've done
00:21:14 3000 episodes of the pcp
00:21:17 Uh, it's I guess it's it's okay to recycle material, but it's not okay to recycle material from last from last week
00:21:24 So I have to I have to be careful about that sort of thing
00:21:27 um, yeah, I mean
00:21:29 For me, it's a little difficult because like the secret project
00:21:32 Secret I don't want to reveal it yet, but I'm thinking in the back of my head
00:21:37 Well, if it has been revealed I could there's so much I could talk about so much content
00:21:41 I can make and put in this podcast we're doing
00:21:44 Yeah, it's like hard because like aside from that and playing video games and learning about pikmin
00:21:49 There's not really much I've been doing
00:21:51 How do I fill a podcast with oh, I've been working
00:21:56 I've been working on something working. You'll know beats beats working
00:22:01 Yeah, yeah, I mean I I have to wonder at some point like does anyone care what the secret is
00:22:08 Would I already know what it is?
00:22:10 You do but like like the people like would it is the is the hype building or is there no point to me keeping a secret about it?
00:22:16 I'm not sure. I think
00:22:18 I think that um
00:22:20 Probably some people listening are curious what the secret is probably most people will only be the most hype when it's
00:22:30 Revealed all of a sudden, right?
00:22:32 I feel like I feel like the real the real win of being secret to a certain extent it might build hype
00:22:37 Well, okay, it would build hype if you were like it's a secret
00:22:41 It's a secret but but I'll release it like at a specific date
00:22:44 And then you would hype up like this is the date that I'm going to drop the secret and maybe you
00:22:48 Drop a few like very tiny breadcrumbs
00:22:51 If you do that would maybe build hype in the moment
00:22:53 It's probably only building a bit of interest
00:22:55 But it will be the moment when you release
00:22:57 And all of a sudden you're like here's this fully finished thing that I never even talked about before
00:23:02 That will be everyone will be like what?
00:23:05 It is one of those like
00:23:08 Because I imagine like
00:23:09 I'll put it out on the pcp
00:23:11 Not everybody listens to the pcp that's in the like pcp fan circle
00:23:15 So I have to go to discourse and tell people individually. Hey. Hey, look at this. Look at this
00:23:19 And even then there'll be people who slip through the cracks and be like months and months later be like, oh my god
00:23:24 Give I had no idea you were doing this. I was like, yeah, well
00:23:27 Follow me on twitter. Are you idiot?
00:23:30 I'll you don't talk about it. Oh, well, well once you put it out. Yeah once I'm not gonna not tweet on twitter
00:23:36 It's gonna be gonna say it in every possible way I can
00:23:40 I wonder what my reach is if you could if you could quantify that
00:23:44 Yeah
00:23:45 How many people could I notify about a thing I'm doing?
00:23:49 I believe yeah your your reach
00:23:52 I believe the term for that would be your reach. Yes
00:23:56 My neurons how far can my neurons reach other neurons from other people?
00:24:01 um
00:24:02 So, yeah, I get phantoms revenge is like no longer a secret project. It was for a while. Um
00:24:09 Oh my god, I'm just I'm thinking
00:24:12 Man, I started working on it in December
00:24:16 And then I I released the demo in april
00:24:19 And now it's november
00:24:23 God I'm like
00:24:25 God
00:24:27 I that that feels terrible. What even happened this year? I don't know
00:24:32 Oh my god, I don't think anything happened. I think I was sick most of this year. That feels terrible and I
00:24:39 I I hope I I feel like okay. My gut says the answer is no
00:24:44 But I don't know if I can trust my gut on this one. I hope that it's wrong
00:24:49 My gut feeling is no and the question is like was it worth the time?
00:24:54 Does did the time justify itself?
00:24:57 Uh in in working on it. I hope so
00:25:01 Uh, I guess we'll see
00:25:03 Oh wait, I know what happened
00:25:05 I made the lord of good for yeah, well for me the lord of ghost kickstarter
00:25:10 Clarissa gunsmoke and then from january the secret project was started
00:25:14 You did do Clarissa gunsmoke this that was this year, right earlier?
00:25:18 Yeah, there was a few there was a few weeks months ago. It was fully released and I you know august
00:25:25 How long ago was august what the fuck well, it's november
00:25:30 That would have been three and a half months ago. No, it was longer ago than that, right?
00:25:34 There's no way the no Clarissa gunsmoke initially with the streams was last year, but I released it recently. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. That's
00:25:43 Yeah, yeah
00:25:46 Um, but I
00:25:47 Okay, the thing about secret projects though that I want to say is phantom's revenge is no longer a secret project
00:25:53 But I have recently started another secret project, but it's not no. No, it's not what you think
00:25:59 I'm not going to say what it is. It's not a thing that I have revenge dlc
00:26:05 It's not something
00:26:07 It's not something like phantom's revenge where i'm going to be working on it for a long time. It's just a little
00:26:12 It's just a little uh thing
00:26:15 I can't even I can't even starting a band. I can't even hint at what it is without giving it away
00:26:20 I hope this will not be too long before I can announce it. Um, it is just a little thing
00:26:25 Like I cook in under the hood in the background. It will hopefully be ready
00:26:32 It probably it will hopefully be ready in not too long and I will not actually have to do a lot of like work on it myself
00:26:39 I won't
00:26:41 Give any more details than that what it is. But when it's ready, I'll let people know and I think everyone will
00:26:47 Have a good chuckle about it. I think it will be very amusing
00:26:52 Uh for everyone and that's all I'm gonna say about it
00:26:55 I see I have an idea what it might be, but I won't say anything. Okay. Yes, please. Please. Please don't please don't say anything
00:27:01 If you have an idea. Yeah, um, but it's
00:27:04 It's a little
00:27:06 It's gonna be funny. It's gonna be really funny
00:27:08 Okay, that's all I gotta say about that
00:27:11 Um
00:27:13 All right, uh, let me complain for a second. You already know this kid, but I just got a complaint about my headphones. Um
00:27:20 Yes, so for a long time. I've had this my headphones have been shit
00:27:24 And uh, they just sometimes like the the battery they're wireless the battery dies on them all the time
00:27:29 The signal sometimes just fails recently on the last like five or six episodes of the pcp
00:27:34 I've had a thing where my
00:27:37 Signal will get choppy and I'll have like difficulty
00:27:40 It'll be a little choppy
00:27:41 and
00:27:42 The only way I can fix it is by turning my head a little bit to the left
00:27:46 Just sitting where I am and just turn my head a little bit left
00:27:49 And then it it it works better for some reason
00:27:53 um
00:27:54 the
00:27:55 Today I plug in my I had unplugged my headphones because I had been using my usb ports for other things
00:28:00 So I plug the dongle back in and I sit down to record and
00:28:04 There's almost no signal. I can just it's so choppy that it's just a little occasional
00:28:12 And um the I'm like okay
00:28:16 And I try turning my head and it again I can turn my head and when I turn my head to this one particular angle
00:28:22 Oh, I can kind of hear
00:28:24 But I'm like I can't just sit with my head at a single angle
00:28:28 It's so bad that I'm not just going to sit here frozen in place with my head at this one angle
00:28:32 Like a radio aerial just like oh, oh, I gotta tilt my head or I can't hear
00:28:35 So I had to get my these other headphones out
00:28:37 My dad gave me a pair of headphones a while ago
00:28:40 And I busted them out today and I've plugged them in and they're working pretty well
00:28:44 I don't they're not as comfy. I don't know. They're they're the kind that like go over your ears, which I sort of don't like as much
00:28:50 Um, but whatever they're fine
00:28:53 They're fine except that the cord these are not wireless. I think they have a bluetooth connection, but I have not enabled it
00:28:59 but um
00:29:00 The the the headphone jack cord that they came with is so short. It's like two feet long. I can't move my head
00:29:07 Oh god. Oh, I know. Oh god. I unplugged it. I unplugged it
00:29:12 Wait, I'm plugging it back. I moved I jerked my head to make a point
00:29:16 Um, can you hear hello? Are you there? Okay? I can hear you. Okay. Wait
00:29:22 Say say something
00:29:25 Okay, no, all right. I thought maybe I was hearing it through bluetooth, but um
00:29:30 Okay, say something again something few. All right, uh, cool. So anyway, that's my
00:29:37 I was gonna say gotta get a longer cord, but actually I should probably just try and enable bluetooth
00:29:42 I guess that would probably be good. I never liked wireless headphones
00:29:46 I mean, I know the appeal the the utility of such a thing
00:29:50 Very obviously great. You can move your head around, but I've got these um
00:29:54 I've had these I think I have to take them off to see the logo hang on
00:30:00 Yeah, Sennheiser
00:30:02 Sennheiser headphones that are like used
00:30:05 They were recommended by my university as like good for doing audio work
00:30:11 So I got those and they've got a really long cable
00:30:14 I can walk all the way around the room wearing them and they're comfortable
00:30:18 And I've had them forever
00:30:21 And it's just a wired connection. It's just so much more reliable
00:30:24 When I even even with my wireless headphones, I would often
00:30:29 Use them with a wire because they would need to have them plugged into a wall socket
00:30:33 You know because they'd be out of battery anyway. So like half the time it it didn't even matter that they were wireless
00:30:40 Yeah, it doesn't yeah, it doesn't matter to me that much
00:30:42 Whether they're wireless or not
00:30:44 Um, just this short wire is very annoying. I can't
00:30:48 I mean at least I can change the angle of my head. I just can't move my head more than like two feet away from my
00:30:54 computer tower, uh lull
00:30:57 Um
00:31:01 Hey, you know what I was you know what I was uh doing I did a little bit the last like day or two
00:31:07 Just because you mentioned it on the last episode that I went and I I watched some
00:31:12 I watched some some british, uh, uh
00:31:15 Some british financial youtubers talk about credit cards
00:31:19 Uh, oh
00:31:20 Yes, I learned a little bit. I sort of I was a bit disappointed to learn
00:31:26 What I had already felt might be the case
00:31:30 Which is that um the rewards you can get from british credit cards are just not very good
00:31:37 No, they never looked very interesting. There's one there's one guy I watched called sasha yansen
00:31:43 And his basically he said that like
00:31:46 Yeah, like like cashback rewards cards in the uk
00:31:52 Almost don't exist like they used to kind of exist
00:31:55 But now they they've been like just in the last like a year or two. They've been like drastically reduced
00:32:00 I think because due to covet he said it's that seemed to have something to do with it
00:32:04 But he recommended he recommended there's like one left that kind of is good
00:32:10 That he recommended and they were um the amex the amex platinum cashback
00:32:15 And the amex platinum cashback every day are two like similar
00:32:19 Cards that do give a a note a substantial reward. They have a certain like they have a sign-up bonus and they have a percentage cashback
00:32:29 uh bonus so if you were still
00:32:33 interested that was
00:32:34 Uh what he recommended amex platinum cashback cashback cashback every day the difference is like the every day one is no fee
00:32:41 But it like has like a slightly lower reward basically, so it's like if you're gonna spend over like 10 000
00:32:49 Over like 5 000 pounds in a certain period
00:32:52 The the regular one is better, but if you're gonna spend less than that the every day is better
00:32:57 Something like that
00:32:58 um
00:32:59 That was that that was the what I learned that was basically the gist of what I learned
00:33:03 Uh from do you have a link to that video so I can listen to him say it. I um, yeah, I think there were
00:33:11 Sasha Jansen baron cohen
00:33:16 Wait Sasha Jansen
00:33:19 Yeah, there were there were two there was one where he just kind of
00:33:23 Okay, I think I think this was the video. There's one where he goes over like
00:33:27 Okay, I I think he probably mentions the the amex platinum
00:33:32 Every day cashback in this one right here. Uh, I'll put it in the
00:33:38 Sorry, I'm taken forever to do this. I'll put it in general here
00:33:43 Does he does he mention amazon classic tesco foundation zopa aqua advanced capital one classic
00:33:49 Oh, no, these are um
00:33:51 These are no these are like beginner ones
00:33:54 There's a different video where he recommends the the amex platinum one
00:33:58 shit
00:33:59 No, I gotta find it
00:34:02 I have to find elias are cut out the awkward silences
00:34:06 Uh, okay. He definitely does mention the amex platinum cashback in this one
00:34:11 I think this is it
00:34:13 There might have been one or two other ones, but uh, yeah, anyway
00:34:16 Okay, that thumbnail is funny. Even though I use that as the currency denominator
00:34:22 Symbol it's funny seeing it being like oh make pound pound pound. Oh, yeah
00:34:27 Instead of dollar dollar dollar. Yeah, I'm so used to seeing dollars used. Yeah, just as like, you know, you're right. I noticed that too
00:34:35 Those crazy Brits in there crazy crazy gbps
00:34:41 I love I've always loved writing the little pound sign not like that. I do like a squiggly one
00:34:49 Yeah, with like it's the loop at the bottom. Yeah, the loop way loop at the top and the bottom
00:34:55 Yeah, I like it too. Um
00:34:58 I like I like I like treble clefs and I like ampersands
00:35:02 And I like um the pound sign
00:35:05 The the gbp pound sign not the hashtag. Yeah, is there a name for that or is it just the pound sign?
00:35:13 Yeah, it can't well if it's called the pound sign then it shares its name
00:35:18 Hold on
00:35:19 Sim, okay symbol
00:35:22 This is fun fact challenge. Oh, we're looking up first symbol for gbp
00:35:32 Uh
00:35:35 Okay, well, it's well, it's called the pound sterling
00:35:39 No, it is it's just called the pound sign
00:35:42 pound sign the pound sign is the symbol for the pound sterling
00:35:48 Okay origin symbol derived from the uppercase latin letter l
00:35:53 Representing Libra pondo
00:35:55 Also pondo pound, okay
00:35:57 same
00:35:59 Basic unit of weight so it was always a unit of weight same same origin as the lb for like pounds as in the weight measurement
00:36:09 Wait, no
00:36:11 Is is that that's lb not lp
00:36:15 Oh interesting lb toss
00:36:18 That the pound it was always a weight became an english unit of weight and in england became defined as the tower pound
00:36:26 Equivalent to 350 grams of sterling silver
00:36:30 So it's based on silver the literal weight of silver is why it's called the pound
00:36:35 Interesting. I I feel like I knew that I feel like
00:36:39 I'd never looked at this before I kind of just assumed that like it had to be a pound of something right
00:36:45 And I mean it's called a pound sterling so like of course it's silver
00:36:50 What else
00:36:52 I was
00:36:54 I was
00:36:56 Wait, you there?
00:36:57 Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Um, you miss me
00:37:01 Yeah, um
00:37:03 Big big Joel made a thread on twitter the other day where he talked he mentioned he talked about inflation
00:37:09 And how like inflation is kind of good actually
00:37:12 Because like if if a currency inflates
00:37:16 I don't care about his fetishes
00:37:18 Ah
00:37:20 It devalued it devalues it literally like helps the bottom
00:37:25 Like percentage because it devalues the assets of the people that have a lot of money
00:37:30 And it devalues the debt of people that owe money
00:37:34 Like it's like in when inflation it's literally like good for poor people when inflation happens as long as it doesn't like go out of control
00:37:41 Hyperinflation the economy's broken
00:37:43 um
00:37:44 And he mentioned he mentioned the gold
00:37:47 I forget that he mentioned this and I had heard of it before but it wasn't something I knew a lot about he mentioned that like
00:37:53 the switch like from the
00:37:55 From the I think from like the the gold standard to the silver standard or something was like a big
00:38:01 Like proletarian movement. It was like a working class movement to switch from the gold standard and like
00:38:06 Doing that like somehow
00:38:10 Caused like a mass wealth transfer
00:38:12 basically
00:38:14 It was it was the idea was like
00:38:17 That also was sort of like devaluing currency
00:38:19 But it was like there was a big like there was like a labor push
00:38:23 For like the the adoption of like the silver standard
00:38:27 And it was and like the goal there was like yeah devalue the currency
00:38:32 because it represents in effect a
00:38:35 mass wealth transfer from the top to the bottom
00:38:38 Uh and inflation kind of does that which is sort of interesting
00:38:42 I guess that makes sense if you've got like a large amount of money and it goes down by a percent
00:38:47 The richest people will lose more
00:38:49 It's it's it's true person. It's it. Yeah, it does make sense and it's and it's just true people get
00:38:56 People get hung up on like oh inflation. Oh my my money is worthless and like
00:39:01 Yeah
00:39:02 true
00:39:03 Your your money is worth less
00:39:06 sort of but like
00:39:08 If every if yeah, if everybody's money is collectively worth less
00:39:13 Then the cost of goods
00:39:15 must
00:39:16 increase across the board
00:39:19 Right well like like it your money is is worthless, but people who have more money
00:39:24 It's worth even less and so it's sort of normalizing
00:39:28 Yes
00:39:28 So in in terms of like where you stand on like the hierarchy you have actually moved up because the people above you have been hurt worse than you
00:39:37 Uh based a little bit based a little bit base
00:39:40 um
00:39:42 Yeah
00:39:44 Economy am I right?
00:39:46 um
00:39:48 No, you're wrong. Oh, oh the the reason why okay, um
00:39:54 Long long time viewer someone who I someone whose name I remembered but I had not heard from or seen post in a long long time
00:40:01 on twitter reverse spectrum
00:40:04 Uh, he added me with a video that he thought I would be interested in and he was absolutely right. This was amazing
00:40:11 um, this was a video
00:40:13 about the infinite money machine is what it was called wait the the um
00:40:19 What was the channel called infinite?
00:40:21 money
00:40:22 machine
00:40:24 This was okay. The the channel was called patrick boil
00:40:27 Uh
00:40:28 This video is very funny. He delivers it in like a very dry sort of sarcastic way and it's it's really funny
00:40:34 It's a good video here. I'll link the video. Um
00:40:37 The the point of the video is a story about a guy who
00:40:42 Basically he basically scammed his credit card company, but it's like legal
00:40:48 He just exploited a loophole were in
00:40:50 He had a card that gave him 5 cash back on at grocery stores. So he would go to grocery stores
00:40:58 Buy visa gift cards
00:41:00 Use the visa gift cards to buy money orders
00:41:04 Transfer the money orders into as deposits into his bank account
00:41:08 And then use the balance in his bank account to pay the
00:41:13 The the credit card that he had used to buy the visa gift cards
00:41:17 And you know all the the fees in that transaction
00:41:21 Were less than the 5 cash back that he was getting from doing it
00:41:26 And so he was just getting free money every single time he did it and he just did it for a year
00:41:31 And he made like 300 thousand dollars
00:41:35 and
00:41:36 Yeah, and the funny and the funny part is they couldn't even tax him
00:41:40 They couldn't even tax him on the income because it's not income. It's discounts
00:41:46 He he generated 300 thousand dollars in free money and it wasn't even income
00:41:50 It was 300 thousand dollars in discounts of money that he never had in the first place
00:41:57 um
00:41:58 Just just awesome just awesome and um, I guess that doesn't work anymore. It's um, okay
00:42:07 It might work in some cases. It's basically just a question of like how soon will the bank catch you doing it
00:42:15 If the bank, I mean the bank can terminate your account for any reason if they catch you generating hundreds of thousands of dollars
00:42:21 They can just terminate your account if they want to so it's basically just like how
00:42:26 How can you fly under also?
00:42:28 Yeah, it's how long can you fly under the radar doing it?
00:42:30 And also I think that kind of across the board like rewards and cash back have just kind of gone down
00:42:37 Uh in term because of like the economic, you know recession and stuff
00:42:42 Um, so that's a bit so it's a bit harder to do. It's definitely harder for a multitude of reasons
00:42:49 But I think I don't know I was considering how I could maybe pull off a limited version of it
00:42:55 um
00:42:56 like, uh, I don't know I have um
00:42:59 I could buy like instacart gift instacart gift cards
00:43:03 I can buy them online. I don't even have to go to a store
00:43:06 If I could flip them
00:43:08 For even a small even a for like a relatively small
00:43:12 A fee I could do that with the I have I don't have unlimited
00:43:17 5% like this guy had but I have I have like 5 cash back on groceries up to like an annual limit of like
00:43:24 You know $10,000 or whatever
00:43:27 So if I could like do that much I could be generating, you know
00:43:31 A few hundred maybe a thousand dollars
00:43:34 I mean optimally if I if I could do it with no loss, which I probably can't
00:43:38 Um, but it really makes you think
00:43:41 Gets your noggin joggin
00:43:43 Uh, there's something
00:43:45 So appealing to me there's something so appealing to me about like
00:43:50 About cheating the system
00:43:53 About like just living on like not
00:43:56 What's really appealing to me about stuff like this is that it's like if this is how you make your money
00:44:01 You're not working for anyone. You don't have an employer
00:44:04 Nobody is extracting your your surplus value
00:44:08 You're just taking it from people with more than you
00:44:11 And I just think that's so cool. It's noble. It's noble in my in my opinion. I would call myself a hero actually
00:44:19 Oh
00:44:21 Yeah
00:44:23 Um, so anyway good good good video that one. Oh, he has another one about like the beanie baby
00:44:30 He had one about it was it's sort of about crypto, but it's more just generally about like
00:44:36 Bubbles and like, you know in like
00:44:39 Investing frenzies collecting frenzies in general. He talks about like
00:44:44 Just collectible assets or so-called treasure assets in general and how
00:44:49 Like yeah, sometimes they increase in value, but they're usually like they're lossier than like traditional assets
00:44:55 They're more subject to risk
00:44:57 They're more subject to like market whims. They don't generally outperform
00:45:03 Uh, sometimes they do but they in general they don't outperform the market
00:45:08 Uh, so they're just kind of stupid
00:45:10 Uh
00:45:13 God, I don't know crypto is bad
00:45:15 Uh, he compared he compared the nfts to like the beanie baby
00:45:19 craze, which I think is probably definitely true
00:45:23 God
00:45:24 Yeah, if if only they the nfts were as cute as beanie babies
00:45:28 I know right they could they could at least they could at least be cute if they do nothing else
00:45:35 Um, it ironically would make it like harder to hate if they were like cute
00:45:42 I don't know animal animal crossing-esque like little things. It's like oh look at others the fact that they're ugly. It's just like
00:45:49 Honestly, it's it makes it so easy
00:45:52 Honestly, I'm glad
00:45:54 Honestly, yeah, I'm glad that they're ugly like I'm glad that they look like shit
00:45:59 If they looked good, I feel like fewer people would hate them, which would be bad
00:46:03 So like I'm glad that they look bad. I'm thankful
00:46:05 I would hate to live in a world where like they're good and people like them
00:46:11 I
00:46:16 I guess the only other thing I have on my list of things to mention is that I've been reading a book
00:46:25 Could you believe it?
00:46:27 No
00:46:28 It's called uh, it's called the general by c.s. Forester
00:46:33 Oh, that's a good song. Do you know that song?
00:46:36 I I don't I have seen the others and I have discovered that this fight is not worth fighting
00:46:44 I like that song. Anyway continue
00:46:47 Yeah, the general first published in 1936 is kind of about uh, a general in
00:46:54 his his life and times
00:46:57 During before and then during the world war one
00:47:00 Where he's like doing stuff. It's just really nicely written
00:47:04 And it's good and it's a little tiny little
00:47:07 ancient little
00:47:08 book
00:47:10 But the best thing about it
00:47:12 The best thing about it that I found is that I have this leather bookmark
00:47:19 And I love having a leather bookmark in my hands
00:47:23 Well, my other hands I'm reading the book because something about I've had this for like
00:47:28 More than a decade. I've used it for various books
00:47:32 It's a bookmark that doesn't degrade easily. I think about other leather bookmarks from like, I don't know
00:47:38 Like uh, you go to a fucking place or zoo and they have like the generic station area a zoo
00:47:45 Yeah, when you when you try to think of a gen a generic place the first thing that comes to mind, you know
00:47:50 Like a zoo places that are like locations that are cool for kids and they have places that give like
00:47:56 Yeah, yeah gift shops and memorabilia and stuff. Sure. Yeah
00:48:00 They they they have their their things relating to the place they and then they have the generic stationery
00:48:05 Oh, it's a pencil with the name of the place you're at
00:48:08 pencil sharpener
00:48:10 Whatever
00:48:11 There's like a lot of these leather bookmarks. It's hard to say bookmark
00:48:16 um
00:48:17 And they're so fun to have because you hold them and there's they they give a little bit
00:48:24 They're kind of tough, but over time you sort of wear it in
00:48:27 Mmm, and it's it's a really good. It's a really good
00:48:32 fidgety thing that doesn't break easily
00:48:34 And it's you know, it's just
00:48:37 It's a tactile
00:48:39 That's why I like reading real books is only because of the bookmark is so fucking fun to hold in my hand while I'm reading
00:48:46 Yeah, I can't get into kindle because it's like, uh, I'm looking at a screen
00:48:50 I I've heard that screens are bad
00:48:53 Even though it's not really powerful screens are bad
00:48:55 But like, um, and if it's on my computer or an audiobook, I'm like, ah, but I if I'm listening to a podcast
00:49:02 Audiobook, I got to be doing something else and I I can't pay attention to it
00:49:07 But reading a physical book works because of the bookmark
00:49:10 Everybody should have a leather bookmark and they will read like a hundred thousand times more
00:49:16 That is my and it's my pitch for bookmarks
00:49:19 leather
00:49:21 It's a hard sell
00:49:23 The general itself is is a very nicely written book
00:49:27 But it is very old and there are a few times where the hard rn word is used. I've seen
00:49:33 What is it about?
00:49:35 Well, it's about a general in his exploits to like
00:49:38 Go through the ranks and it's like it's a character book. It's not really like so it's a war. It's about this one guy
00:49:46 There's a novel. Yes. Okay. Okay. I think there are some
00:49:49 Characters that are real generals or real like army officials that were integral to the war and he interacts with them
00:49:56 and
00:49:57 and it's like, uh, he's kind of
00:49:59 Autistic this guy. He's all very prim and proper, but he hates social interactions and he just talks in very normal
00:50:06 Not normal, but like very direct
00:50:09 emotionless ways
00:50:11 and he gets he has like he
00:50:14 he meets a
00:50:15 the the daughter of a
00:50:17 duchess
00:50:19 and she is like described to be sort of horse-faced and ugly
00:50:23 and like not not particularly
00:50:26 you know
00:50:27 Fancy and stuff for her station. She you know, she knows how to dress and all that but it's like
00:50:33 She is unremarkable and he's kind of socially awkward and they really loved each other and they got on so well
00:50:41 and it's like
00:50:43 You know, she she as a as a daughter of a duke and duchess
00:50:48 Doesn't really she's quite sheltered. She doesn't know what a real man is like
00:50:53 Um, she doesn't know what it's like to have like sex that's like good and he's kind of bad at it
00:50:59 But because she doesn't have a frame of reference
00:51:01 She's okay with all that and it's it's kind of funny. It's kind of funny how
00:51:06 this guy
00:51:08 I don't know it's it's hard to explain the the appeal of this character in this book
00:51:13 um
00:51:15 The general go read it. Just it's it's my book report. Who who's it by?
00:51:20 A c.s. Forrester as I said, oh, sorry. I'm stupid lull
00:51:25 He's a he's a guy who who wrote something or other. What did he write?
00:51:30 He wrote something or other. I don't I don't know. I don't know books. I I just like sphabas or something
00:51:39 Something something hornblower
00:51:43 Observer, I don't know if I can know I'm reading the back like I have it right in front of me, but yeah
00:51:49 The general it's it's like
00:51:54 I think the thing I like it's Herbert Curzon is the name of the guy character
00:52:01 Yeah, the thing I like about him is that he's kind of autistic
00:52:05 and
00:52:06 Very relatable to me in a funny way in funny ways like he's so old fashioned
00:52:13 But like his his his thought process is like described in such a way that I'm like, yeah, you know what?
00:52:18 Parties do suck. I do like not want to go to them
00:52:23 True and he's and he's all like he's really into
00:52:27 making his army his his battalion is his
00:52:32 Squad I'm not sure what you call it that he's in charge of
00:52:35 um
00:52:36 By the time the first world war is going and he's in the trenches
00:52:40 and he's like um
00:52:41 he's really into
00:52:43 like be he's he's got a
00:52:48 A way with like making sure everything runs well for the purposes of being better than other people
00:52:54 And people respect his like strictness and is no nonsense stuff
00:52:58 And he's not like he doesn't have a good personality which makes him perfect for like running a tight ship
00:53:03 and it's just sort of
00:53:05 I don't know it's it's weirdly cute. I find him weirdly cute as an old-fashioned timey general
00:53:12 Hmm
00:53:14 I'm reading the I'm trying not to I'm reading a bit of the
00:53:18 story framework on on wikipedia
00:53:22 That seems I've never read I've never read anything by c.s. Forrester
00:53:29 I just had it on my shelf and it's like, oh, this is old. Maybe it's good, you know old good
00:53:33 new bat so
00:53:35 True and it turns out to be true. That's what I did with um when I lived with those guys in um california for a while
00:53:41 I just like one of the girls had a bunch of old books on her shelf and I just grabbed old books and read them
00:53:46 That's when I read um the plague by camu
00:53:50 and I read uh
00:53:52 The stranger also by camu just read a lot of camu. Wait is stranger by camu?
00:54:01 I don't yes. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Um, she must have been a camu fan
00:54:07 um
00:54:11 Neat, um
00:54:14 Oh god, there's a there's a loud
00:54:17 The helicopter outside my window, but the way there were there were people talking
00:54:21 There were people talking like right outside my window when I first uh logged on but they they quickly
00:54:27 Stopped so good good for them. I appreciate that a lot
00:54:32 Good for them. I have only one more note about things I did this week
00:54:37 And it was something that I got really excited about almost as excited as I got about drawing that angry face
00:54:44 last week
00:54:45 Um, it was about it was about water
00:54:49 It was about I was really hyped for different kinds of waters that I could acquire
00:54:54 I was um
00:54:55 I went on
00:54:57 I went on
00:54:59 I went on instacart and I'm like I'm almost out of sparkling water
00:55:03 It's time for me to shop around for more and I went on
00:55:08 I went to uh, hana fords. I looked I looked up the menu at hana fords
00:55:11 I looked what they have what what they have on offer in terms of sparkling water versus seltzer water
00:55:17 I looked at uh, aldi. I found I found new offerings at aldi that I had not seen before
00:55:22 um
00:55:24 I have I have learned
00:55:26 I have I now have a big shelf full of all different kinds of
00:55:30 sparkling waters sparkling water beverages and seltzer waters
00:55:36 Uh, as well as just water beverages neither sparkling nor seltzers. Um
00:55:41 God, I'm I'm truly rich in spirit
00:55:45 um the the
00:55:47 I have learned that many places sell things that are called sparkling waters
00:55:52 But they have artificial sweeteners and like flavorings in them
00:55:57 Making them basically just soda
00:55:59 But with like a sort of health conscious branding
00:56:03 To them, but I like them a lot. I love them. They're my favorite. I think I think there was like a tom scott video
00:56:11 explaining why disani isn't sold in the uk
00:56:15 Hmm because like uh coca-cola
00:56:17 Owns disani and disani is like an amer- it's it's seen as an american thing to have mineral water where the minerals are added
00:56:26 um
00:56:27 like artificially
00:56:30 And so like this kind of like uh, it was a huge backlash
00:56:34 against disani once that was found out and
00:56:37 because of a
00:56:39 TV show only fools and horses an episode where there was a scam
00:56:43 It was a comedy skit show and what's oh, okay, okay
00:56:46 and uh, there was an episode where there was like a scam with like
00:56:50 Sewage water being sold as special something or other and that was like in the public consciousness when that scandal happened
00:56:56 Or it became a scandal because of that and then they couldn't sell that water because nobody trusted it
00:57:01 So and and so mineral water is like you can't put the things in afterwards
00:57:05 You can't add things to water has to be just water. What the fuck?
00:57:10 Wait, okay. So the problem with disani is that they add minerals to it
00:57:14 Yeah, they they they have a treatment plant where and that's and that's bad
00:57:19 I I think chemically there's no difference at all. It should be fine
00:57:23 In fact, it is as far as I understand disani any water where you just
00:57:28 Mineral water like from the scottish highlands or whatever I guess bottled and then sold and it's like
00:57:33 Oh, it's actually from there or it's actually it's like got rid of like
00:57:37 Crud and soil and you know bad things they filter things out
00:57:42 But they don't add like chemicals in
00:57:44 Because of the public perception of that being a bad thing even though it's probably fine
00:57:49 So that's just how water is in the uk. That's why I have never seen or like rather
00:57:55 Um, but we have different brands for water bottles in the uk that I've never seen in america or like the other way around
00:58:02 And I didn't never have seen disani before I went to america. It was always avian or volvo or like stuff like that
00:58:11 Highland spring
00:58:13 I think
00:58:15 I think that's the difference between
00:58:18 sparkling water
00:58:20 And seltzer. Uh, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Uh
00:58:23 Okay
00:58:25 I think that like if if they artificially
00:58:28 carbonate it
00:58:29 Then it is seltzer
00:58:32 If it's like naturally carbonated
00:58:35 Uh, then it's naturally carbonated. Yeah. Yeah, like certain. Okay
00:58:39 It seems
00:58:40 Silly and I kind of feel like there's no way they actually do this
00:58:44 Like they actually go to like a naturally occurring like carbonated water spring and like obtain
00:58:50 Natural sparkling water from the spring like there's no way that they do that
00:58:55 But like supposedly that's the difference between seltzer and sparkling in practice
00:59:00 I have I am finding that the difference is that sometimes they will they will just add a bunch of shit
00:59:05 Add a bunch of like flavorings and sweeteners and shit to spark to sparkling water
00:59:10 And make it basically soda
00:59:13 Uh, but not always and then they don't do that
00:59:17 Then it's just
00:59:19 I think the difference is that the carbonation is artificial and versus natural
00:59:23 um
00:59:24 and
00:59:25 Minerals man. Minerals are just a whole other whole other ballgame
00:59:30 uh
00:59:32 That's that's
00:59:34 Really so like
00:59:36 Is that is that a it's a is it just a weird uk thing that they're like you can't add the minerals
00:59:41 You gotta you gotta find the night the minerals got to come from the earth or I don't want them
00:59:47 Yeah, I essentially I mean, okay
00:59:50 I think it's it was it was more just like
00:59:53 A scandal happened
00:59:55 And then from then public perception was like, oh, it has to be like real otherwise. It's it. Yeah, it's being natural from
01:00:04 You know a water source or a high up in the mountains or or just wherever but like you can't add chemicals into water
01:00:11 We won't buy it and so that's just sort of continued
01:00:14 I don't know whether it's changed, but from what I remember from this tom scott video, which wasn't that long ago
01:00:20 Uh, it's still like that
01:00:23 I'm reading some article here
01:00:26 Spring water is according to fda. This is american definition
01:00:30 A spring a spring water is according to fda derived from an underground
01:00:34 Formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth at an identified location called a spring
01:00:41 It can be a man-made borehole, but there are other regulations associated with that if it's a man-made spring
01:00:48 Uh mineral water also comes from an underground source
01:00:52 But it differs from spring water because mineral water contains a quote
01:00:56 constant level and relative proportions of minerals and trace elements at the point of emergence from the source
01:01:03 What
01:01:06 What
01:01:08 So mineral water is just spring water, but it's like it has a certain amount. It has like the right amount
01:01:14 of nutrients in it or minerals, I guess
01:01:18 artesian water refers to
01:01:21 Water that comes from a tapped aquifer artesian actually refers to the natural geological process of pressure that causes water
01:01:28 From an aquifer, which is a layer of permeable rock and soil that can store water to rise to the surface and form a well
01:01:34 Oh, no artesian. Oh, not artisanal. It's not artisanal water
01:01:38 It's artesian water, which is not referred to like craftsmanship. Okay. I know what an aquifer is because I play dwarf fortress
01:01:46 So no need to explain that to me
01:01:48 Uh my my recipes dot com
01:01:52 Um fuck
01:01:54 So reading gov dot uk about so much rigmarole. What is what is this considered?
01:02:00 Mineral water and the definitions of stuff. I think it's mostly like a branding thing
01:02:04 Like you can sell water where you add stuff in but you can't call it mineral water or something
01:02:10 Because it would be insane
01:02:12 I guess tap water is technically mineral water. I'm not even sure actually
01:02:16 Okay, this is just a list of all the natural mineral waters recognized in the uk
01:02:21 And how to apply for recognition. Okay. Well, whatever. It's not information
01:02:26 It's just a list
01:02:27 I don't know how to read this that that definition that I just read seemed to specify the to be mineral water
01:02:32 It has to it has to have the minerals
01:02:36 When it leaves the ground
01:02:38 Yes
01:02:40 So I guess us has that as well. I don't know. So disaney
01:02:45 is um
01:02:47 Okay, dis disaney is not mineral water. It is
01:02:51 Purified and mineral enhanced water
01:02:55 Yes, that's the distinction. Okay. I see I see it may have been it may I may be reading too much into the video
01:03:01 Because he may have said like it's the reason disaney doesn't get sold
01:03:07 Because there was a an association with treated water being gross
01:03:12 or something
01:03:13 This reminds me there was a not illegal. There was a video recently from folding ideas
01:03:20 Where he talks. I think it's a a british like celebrity chef. I forget the chef's name. Oh jamey oliver. Yeah
01:03:27 Did you see that the chicken nuggets video? I I yeah, I have seen I never really thought about it before
01:03:32 But it makes a lot of sense that he's probably like a bit of a
01:03:35 upper class
01:03:37 the
01:03:37 Yeah, the
01:03:39 the thing about like oh
01:03:42 The chicken what's wrong. What's wrong with the nuggets is that they are unclean
01:03:46 They are made of the unclean part of the chicken the dirty chicken meat
01:03:50 Not the good not the good clean chicken meat the filthy haram chicken meat
01:03:56 um
01:03:56 Yeah, what do you there's that one line dan says where he's like, you know, if if your criteria
01:04:03 For eating of food is that it has to look nice at every stage of production like that's a you problem
01:04:09 That's not really a mark against the food that like at some point in the production like something looked gross about it
01:04:16 Right. Yeah, jamey oliver has been around. I've seen him a lot as like a uk like
01:04:22 guy of of food
01:04:25 relevance note
01:04:26 and and like he's he's definitely been like
01:04:30 prominent in the way he talks about
01:04:33 Uh, I'm just trying to protect the kids because they're eating all this gross
01:04:38 Fatty crap and it's bad
01:04:40 And everyone's like, oh, yes. Yeah, it makes sense
01:04:44 Never really thought about him like that before but it does make sense to think of like he's just
01:04:51 He's health conscious
01:04:53 But like kind of in a stupid way
01:04:57 Yeah
01:04:58 I mean, is it like in the video how he's like
01:05:01 He's sort of trying to contend that the nuggets are unhealthy, but it's not like
01:05:07 It's not really argued
01:05:09 that way
01:05:10 It's argued in a sort of like wishy-washy
01:05:14 aesthetic
01:05:15 Yeah, kind of I mean, I guess this is dirty sort of way dirty for just reasons
01:05:20 Yeah, just for reasons. I
01:05:22 I think it it resonated with a lot of people
01:05:25 For some reason at the time when he was like he was hot shit. He was he was the the the young
01:05:31 crazy new
01:05:32 Chef kid on the block and he's coming out with all these recipes and he goes he goes like bing bong bash
01:05:37 Bosh
01:05:38 Pan like that and I was like, wow cool. Yeah. Wow. Look at this guy. Look at this guy go. He's so quick. Sure
01:05:45 I haven't really seen anything that he does though aside from saying that nuggets suck
01:05:50 I mean, do you I guess do you watch cooking programs? I I don't really I
01:05:56 Well, you know, my parents watch the Great British menu, which is like super high and
01:06:03 Chefs from all corners of the UK
01:06:05 Great Britain Northern Ireland Wales all that Scotland and they have like one from each district
01:06:11 one from each sort of area north of England
01:06:15 Midlands or whatever
01:06:17 And they compete to make a banquet meal
01:06:22 For like a big event somewhere every every year or so
01:06:27 And that's that's a good one
01:06:29 I like because they're like top of the line like Michelin star chefs
01:06:33 From and they're really good at what they do. So it's very interesting seeing them
01:06:38 make like insane
01:06:41 Meals to a brief of like a theme
01:06:45 That's quite fun. And then there's the Great British Bake Off, which is
01:06:49 Well, I've heard of that one baking. Yeah, that that's a big one
01:06:53 Because it's it's you know, that's fun. I don't really watch like much
01:06:58 Myself I'm just sort of catch it when it's on it's like. Oh, yeah. Look at that. Look at that fish
01:07:03 Look and like chop those onions real quick. They know what they're doing
01:07:08 And I think I have seen a bit of Gordon Ramsay
01:07:10 Yelling at people. Oh, sure
01:07:13 Who who has because that that that's always fun, I guess
01:07:19 Uh
01:07:22 What would we how do we get on this topic? Uh, you were talking about sparkling water. Oh, and how the like food
01:07:29 right how
01:07:31 The the the dasani is unclean because it's the minerals do not come from the earth
01:07:36 Uh, I just remembered this. Do you want to I mean, have you been following the uh, the the kyle rittenhouse stuff?
01:07:42 I've been seeing a lot of kyle rittenhouse stuff on twitter
01:07:46 I will not have too much to say about it
01:07:48 I didn't follow it when it's when it first came out as a like a big news thing and I still haven't really followed it
01:07:54 like the just I get
01:07:56 Is that he killed some people
01:07:58 and the court is determining whether
01:08:02 You know how the
01:08:04 What should happen next is he gonna get punished and thrown in jail for murder or is it self-defense?
01:08:09 And that's the big question. I guess he he uh, it seems okay
01:08:14 People say he was defending himself and in the moment. Yeah, he definitely was being
01:08:19 aggressed upon
01:08:21 The the the question in my mind is like
01:08:24 Was he was he aggressing simply by being there and I really think he was
01:08:29 I really think that the fact that he went to this place
01:08:31 Open carrying, you know brandishing his weapon at the protesters was like
01:08:37 made him a a what's what's the like, you know
01:08:40 Basically constituted an active threat and I feel like the the protesters were
01:08:45 Defending themselves by trying to you know disarm him
01:08:49 um
01:08:50 and I think you know
01:08:52 that's my opinion and uh
01:08:54 I am it's very it's been very sad and disheartening seeing
01:09:00 Lots of people lots and lots of people
01:09:04 Even people who you might have thought would know better
01:09:06 Uh be like watch the try watching the trial and be like oh, yeah, I guess I guess it was self-defense after all
01:09:12 Oh, yeah, I'm pro. I'm pro written house now
01:09:15 Uh, it's seem seems like
01:09:19 In my I mean in my corner of the internet
01:09:21 Obviously everyone thinks he's you know, he's guilty seems like the broader
01:09:27 Internet is is turning pro written house, uh, which is is just very sad
01:09:32 Uh
01:09:34 I don't
01:09:36 Maybe it's just doomer talk, but it seems like even the the people that I follow
01:09:41 I follow a few people who are lawyers who have said like
01:09:45 He's getting off. He's got he's getting a full acquittal
01:09:48 Which is very sad, um and makes me upset
01:09:51 um
01:09:52 But I mean in my head like I just assumptions I make from bits and bobs. I see is that oh well, he's white so
01:10:01 like uh
01:10:03 Him brandishing like an automatic weapon
01:10:07 Uh is like
01:10:09 It's gonna be looked at less harshly by the general public
01:10:13 Uh, then if it were a black person and for that reason I just assume maybe he you know
01:10:19 But like I can't really assume that until I've looked more into it
01:10:23 So I'm just uh, whatever
01:10:26 Maybe it sucks. Maybe it sucks. What's happening, but I'm stupid and I haven't been interested enough to look
01:10:32 I have been
01:10:33 honestly, I
01:10:35 You know, I've seen some of the
01:10:37 Judge being like weird and and bad
01:10:40 And I've seen a lot of the lawyers being like doomer about it being like this is fucked. He's getting a full acquittal and like
01:10:48 I don't know. Yeah
01:10:51 I can't I can't affect the outcome
01:10:54 And like who knows how things will shake out
01:10:57 Why why I'm
01:10:59 I feel like I know what's going on. I've kind of just been like I don't sort of don't want to read anything else about it until it's over
01:11:05 and maybe then I'll
01:11:07 I'll be curious what the verdict is
01:11:09 Why why worry about it until then? I mean, I guess if I really wanted to
01:11:15 Take that logic all the way like why worry about it even afterwards like it doesn't directly affect me. Why worry about anything?
01:11:22 Um
01:11:24 Why even care at all? Why not simply touch grass?
01:11:28 Uh, which I mean, I guess I guess that's true
01:11:34 I don't know. I don't know. I have no conclusion
01:11:37 The thing the thing is that I've heard is well, it's like
01:11:42 The the details are iffy
01:11:45 Like it's not like there's like it's not like a police shooting
01:11:49 Where they had a body cam and it's so obvious that the policeman has done wrong or like it was filmed
01:11:55 But yet and yet still
01:11:58 The police are getting off
01:11:59 You know with a tap on the wrist
01:12:01 Um
01:12:03 So like from what like the information involved in what happened is is confusing
01:12:08 And so it could go either way like it could actually be
01:12:11 Like I don't know it really I think I think bringing a bringing a gun to a protest
01:12:18 Really betrays like what you intend to do at the protest. Yeah, why bring a such a large gun?
01:12:24 Yeah
01:12:25 He was he was he was he was there to he was there with a gun to protect
01:12:31 Property other other people's property
01:12:34 with deadly force
01:12:36 And some and some people online think like that's okay and that's good and people should be allowed to do that and should do it more
01:12:44 Which is pretty fucked up
01:12:47 He
01:12:50 I don't know I don't know what else to say about it. Uh, he it's from a moral perspective like
01:12:56 Stopping a window getting smashed by killing someone
01:12:59 Is not equivalent in any way. There's there's no in mind. There's no question that that's that's what he was that that's what it was about for him
01:13:06 Um, he maybe is an intimidation thing. They're like, I don't know sure you have live ammunition. You uh, yeah, whatever
01:13:14 Yeah, um, he
01:13:16 The I've seen the have you seen this judge
01:13:20 The the judge really seems
01:13:23 The judge really seems like a piece of shit. The judge really seems he really seems biased in favor of the defense
01:13:29 And he really seems like he doesn't know what he's talking about and like there was a part where
01:13:35 He just seems weird and like he just rambles about shit for at times
01:13:40 And there were there's a part where like I didn't see this part
01:13:43 I just heard about it, but I guess the prosecution
01:13:45 Was like trying to show him something on a screen
01:13:49 And it was a digital, you know photograph
01:13:51 Or or video screenshot or whatever and they they're they're zooming in right they're just zooming into the image
01:13:59 And the judge doesn't understand what zooming in is and he thinks that they're like digitally altering the image by zooming in on it
01:14:07 And they had to like I guess he asked like extremely old
01:14:11 He's he's not like he's he looks like he's maybe like late sixties
01:14:16 So he's pretty he's pretty old. He's not like ancient
01:14:20 He's quite old
01:14:22 Yeah, but like he
01:14:24 I guess they had to like consult an expert witness about like weather
01:14:29 Zooming in on a photograph counts as like altering
01:14:33 The data but like it doesn't he just seems like he doesn't like
01:14:37 Want to hear
01:14:39 He seems biased is what I'm saying and also incompetent. So
01:14:43 You know
01:14:45 Who knows who knows?
01:14:47 um
01:14:48 It's a lot of like it's a lot of like I can imagine, you know, I can imagine
01:14:53 that there'd be some
01:14:56 larger
01:14:59 Like um attempt to get kyle out of
01:15:03 easy
01:15:05 By like, you know, like familial connections or stuff like that. Um, I could you could imagine a lot. I just
01:15:11 Personally don't know too much about what's going on. So it's hard to say. Oh, yeah, it's all a big bunch of bullshit
01:15:19 I'm not in yeah, so whatever
01:15:23 I'll just say that I think it's dumb to bring a gun
01:15:27 to a place like that
01:15:29 And then not expect anything bad to happen if he gets if he gets an unequittle
01:15:34 the messages
01:15:37 White people
01:15:38 Go out to protest with a gun
01:15:41 shoot protesters
01:15:43 The system supports you
01:15:47 Um
01:15:49 Yeah, I don't know it's bad. Um
01:15:53 I have no more notes. I'm out of notes. I'm out of topics of discussion
01:15:59 Uh, do you got anything else or should you want to go on to voicemails?
01:16:03 Uh
01:16:06 No, I don't think so
01:16:09 Uh, let's go. Let's go. Do you have um
01:16:14 Oh, yeah, I'll get whatever whatever whatever it's called open
01:16:18 Speak pipe speak pipe comm slash pcb voicemails
01:16:21 If you want to send us a voicemail, baby
01:16:27 Um, all right, let me just get these downloaded here
01:16:31 Oh, yeah
01:16:33 Oh, yeah, I'm collecting I'm collecting these voicemails like nfts. I'm right click saving
01:16:39 All right, uh, you ready? Yep. Okay. The first one is called it's venom and
01:16:45 Oh, somebody messed somebody asked me like did I get to play this

01:16:54 Shit was it oblivion fall fuck? I don't remember somebody was like wanted us to play this one last week
01:16:59 But I didn't lol. Anyway, uh, it's venom three two one go
01:17:29 By the proletariat
01:17:45 Bummer
01:18:00 Does it make a different broadcast that would that was growing everything
01:18:06 Okay
01:18:07 So, yeah, this was um because later that that day last sunday when we recorded last episode I did go on the drawcast
01:18:15 later with um
01:18:18 It was sitel teleperte
01:18:20 Was it oblivion oblivion fall? I think yeah, it was like a regular is a host
01:18:25 Yeah, I think it was I think was it just the four of I think it was the four of us. Yeah, we did a um, we did a comics jam
01:18:32 which you know
01:18:33 I you know the pcp
01:18:36 Invented the drawcast and I introduced the pcp two comics jams. So it's basically I basically own this property
01:18:45 It all came from me
01:18:48 We did a did you mention that on the show? Yes, I did a little bit
01:18:52 Um, uh, yeah how I introduced I think it was at
01:18:56 Brony con. I think at one of the brony cons. I got everyone to draw a comics jam
01:19:01 Sitting around in the hallway. Well, hang on. I remember munchy talking about someone
01:19:07 Telling him about it and him telling you about it or was it the other way? No
01:19:11 No, it had to be the other way around because I learned about it from one of my fellow
01:19:15 Camp counselors at astro camp
01:19:18 I definitely did not learn about it from munchy
01:19:21 Okay, so you probably told munchy. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I must have
01:19:25 um
01:19:26 That was funny. We did a yeah, those were we did some pretty funny comics in that one. Uh, there was a
01:19:33 There's a there's a keg standard in phantom horn comic in there, too, which is very good and I like it a lot
01:19:39 Uh, so I got I got teleparted to draw keg in phantom
01:19:44 Uh
01:19:47 Uh, yeah, that was that will be out in a few weeks. I think over on the drawcast
01:19:53 Channel, so go to the drawcast channel
01:19:55 There's a bunch of the content on there and eventually do you know when the the telephone?
01:20:01 One is coming out or people still working on their drawings for that one
01:20:05 Doing the drawings and then they're gonna come back around and ask us to like have like a bit where we
01:20:12 um
01:20:13 Like commentate with them over our section of the drawing like sped up. Yeah
01:20:20 um, yeah
01:20:22 So it'll be still a while before that's finished. Okay. Well, I guess I'll just uh
01:20:29 Wait for that then
01:20:31 That's delicious. Mmm. Lemon seltzer water
01:20:35 Not not sparkling water not flavored not sweet and just regular just a touch a hint
01:20:41 A hint of lemon flavor
01:20:44 God, I love I love deals
01:20:47 I love
01:20:48 I love the taste of a deal. I do this is this is the taste of a deal
01:20:52 I'm looking at I'm looking at the the instacartman and I'm going through and they've got you know
01:20:56 They got cans they got lacroix that that's costs like
01:21:00 Fucking $18 a can boo. Then they got like off-brand lacroix. That's can it's also cans in a box
01:21:08 You know, that's less not good enough lacroix
01:21:11 Then they have
01:21:13 They have what's they have like the uh, the leader the leader bottles
01:21:17 The leader bottles of the various different flavored sparkling waters or like the uh, the six-pack cases of like the smaller bottles
01:21:23 You want to get it bottled you want to get off-brand?
01:21:26 And then it's it's like pay it's like sense
01:21:29 It's like it's like pennies literal pennies for me to drink drink like a king all the flavors
01:21:34 All the flavors of the of the world of of of deepest darkest Peru
01:21:40 deepest africa and the the the the mango the tangy mangoes of the of the of the
01:21:47 Of the the amazon rainforest uh all brought to the
01:21:52 To my palette um from places unknown all for all for pennies on the dollar
01:21:59 anyway
01:22:00 I'm just thinking of like a like a blue steel
01:22:03 keg of lacroix
01:22:06 Blue steel
01:22:07 Why would it be blue like like I don't know just sort of like painted blue like a steel keg
01:22:12 Like a wooden casket of lacroix
01:22:15 um
01:22:16 Lacroix is fine and all it's just that it's name brand so it it costs more and who
01:22:22 It's the same it's the same fucking product
01:22:25 um
01:22:27 Next voicemail is red five rainbow three two one go
01:22:34 Hey, wait, do you think trixie can like copyright strike you?
01:22:41 For selling the road to radcon books
01:22:44 I'm no wait. No, that's a real life one is dm dmca
01:22:48 No, because she abandoned it because I mean she she did write them
01:22:54 You're making a profit off of it. She wrote it for and she like
01:22:58 It was it was it was it was specifically a kickstarter
01:23:02 It was specifically a kickstarter
01:23:04 Uh reward that we promised she promised to deliver it for
01:23:08 Radcon and then didn't so like I I mean, yeah, no, absolutely not
01:23:13 She didn't finish it ben wrote the final chapter
01:23:16 So it's not entirely
01:23:18 but I don't know
01:23:20 I feel like
01:23:22 Imagine imagine if she tried imagine how
01:23:25 Imagine how fucking imagine how fucking stupid she would look. No, nothing would happen
01:23:31 No, it's it would be impossible
01:23:33 um lamal
01:23:35 um
01:23:37 Next voicemail good good question good good question fair fair fair question
01:23:44 But the answer is no
01:23:46 Next voicemail is called your first voicemail recording always sucks three two one go
01:23:55 Ben look we love you, but your defense of investing in bitcoin without mining bitcoin
01:24:00 The other episode was off-based and someone needs to fucking tell you that
01:24:05 Just because you don't actually mind the cryptocurrency itself
01:24:08 Doesn't mean that you're you're not doing harm because you still do harm by giving it legitimacy by giving them money
01:24:14 If nobody invested in bitcoin, it's value. That's a terrible argument and it would just be that's really stupid
01:24:20 tossing the same
01:24:22 million couple million dollars back and forth with each other
01:24:26 Just because we exist in
01:24:28 Society doesn't mean that we need to participate in the worst aspects of it
01:24:32 Just because I exist in society doesn't mean I must go on to become a police officer
01:24:37 Just because I exist in society doesn't mean that I must go on to become a landlord
01:24:41 You like listen just because we exist inside doesn't mean that we have to do yeah, I got it all the bad things that society
01:24:48 Listen you also work to make society better. I
01:24:52 You know it's true. If that's what i'm criticizing about you right now
01:24:56 If only if only nobody just had invested in bitcoin then cryptocurrency wouldn't be a thing if only people didn't buy
01:25:05 NFTs then NFTs wouldn't be a thing like yeah
01:25:09 Obviously I said I said this last week like
01:25:13 Okay, some dag zaggles DM'd me on twitter with what I think was meant to be a technical explanation for why
01:25:22 Crypto transactions are the same as mining and his and he said something about like air dropped coins
01:25:32 And I gotta be honest. I didn't understand what he was telling me dag zaggles if you're listening. I am sorry about that
01:25:39 I don't get it, but maybe you're right. Maybe maybe on a technical level. It is the same in which case
01:25:47 It is what it is
01:25:49 um this argument that like oh you're giving it legitimacy
01:25:54 Is I just don't care. I'm sorry. I said this last week
01:25:58 I don't like bitcoin. I don't like cryptocurrency. I don't like I don't like lots of things. I don't like banks
01:26:05 But I still have my money in a bank
01:26:07 um
01:26:08 the
01:26:09 if if I thought
01:26:12 If I thought if I really thought if I knew for a fact that bitcoin was gonna like double in price tomorrow
01:26:19 I'm sorry. I would buy bitcoin. I would put all my money into bitcoin
01:26:23 Would would that be
01:26:25 Giving it legitimacy. I don't know maybe a little bit. Maybe some insignificant. It's it's too late
01:26:30 It's too late for me to do anything to like actually stop it
01:26:34 But like if it was going to explode tomorrow, I'm sorry. Yeah, I would get it because like
01:26:41 I want my money to double like that that
01:26:45 I guess it's selfish, but like I don't think me not getting it
01:26:50 Would have like a significant impact
01:26:53 I just want I want resources. I need to accrue resources
01:26:58 every person needs to accrue resources in order to thrive and uh
01:27:05 I'm I got I'm sorry. I gotta look out for number one
01:27:09 Yeah, I get the argument, but it's like
01:27:14 It's not that you should strive to engage with things that you don't like but like
01:27:22 It is a kind of a like at a certain point
01:27:26 Everything you do is bad because it's all tied up in
01:27:31 The economy which is tied up in
01:27:34 other things that like
01:27:35 Disenfranchise people or enslave people in other parts of the world. It's like it's hard to not
01:27:40 Yeah
01:27:41 participate
01:27:43 And when you don't
01:27:44 Participate in a small section of it as an individual
01:27:47 Not much changes at all if anything ever
01:27:50 It is not
01:27:51 It's not it's not really the the the the the onus doesn't really on the individual
01:27:57 to set an example
01:27:59 That can change
01:28:01 I don't know the world
01:28:02 If you have a lot of reach then yeah, you got more onus on you to do that
01:28:07 I have I guess we have some it's just so small that it's like
01:28:13 It's I don't know I have never I have never claimed that like my
01:28:18 My own personal not owning bitcoin is like a moral
01:28:23 stance the the reason that I don't own any
01:28:27 Actually, I have a little bit that I had to pull out of Kucoin
01:28:30 But like whatever
01:28:32 The reason that I don't own a significant amount of bitcoin is right now is because
01:28:39 I believe that it is
01:28:41 A bubble that is going to pop at some point and I don't want to be left
01:28:46 Holding the bag if I I'm sorry if I didn't think that
01:28:50 I would buy bitcoin if I thought it was going to go up to a if I was really convinced it was going to 100k
01:28:56 I'd buy it
01:28:57 I'm sorry. I'm I'm sorry
01:29:00 um
01:29:01 I don't think it's going to or or maybe it might but I also think it's going to crash and I just I'm like
01:29:06 I'm looking at it and I'm thinking like
01:29:08 At some point. I think it's going to pop. It's going to crash and I just I just don't want
01:29:14 If if I invest even if it goes even if it goes up a little bit from now
01:29:17 Maybe I could make some money if I invested right now at some point though
01:29:22 There's going to be losses and I think it's probably best avoided
01:29:25 Just so that I don't
01:29:27 And yeah end up holding the bag. I don't know. I might the issue. I could be right or it could be wrong
01:29:32 I guess the issue of that argument really is like
01:29:35 It's it's adjacent to like you live in society like you criticize society like you get you live in it in the same way
01:29:42 He referenced that it could be
01:29:44 Well, yeah, but like and it's yeah, it's it's it's saying
01:29:48 um
01:29:49 you should
01:29:51 like
01:29:52 show us
01:29:53 How you would live outside of a society or like how you would live in a better society
01:29:59 Instead of living in the one you're in now
01:30:01 right, uh
01:30:03 No, maybe it's not entirely
01:30:05 like
01:30:07 The same I'm trying to think of how to put this because like he said
01:30:11 um
01:30:12 Just because you live in a society doesn't mean you have to do anything
01:30:16 He said just because you live in a society doesn't mean you have to participate in the worst parts of it
01:30:21 Right, I mean true
01:30:24 I don't have I don't have by doing it. We're not saying we have
01:30:27 We're not saying anyone should or how to I don't know. I feel like it's just it's
01:30:33 it's putting the pressure on an individual rather than
01:30:38 Like like like the the point of pointing it out and saying hey, you're doing a bad thing
01:30:45 is
01:30:47 It just hurts individuals more than it like changes the world
01:30:51 If you know what I mean like people just feel bad about what they're doing
01:30:55 But the system is still structured in a way that it's hard to not do it. Yeah
01:31:01 And then I don't know
01:31:03 I guess I don't find too much of an issue with him complaining about you or I doing
01:31:08 stuff like that
01:31:09 Yeah, I don't find it helpful either
01:31:12 um
01:31:14 I mean, I guess I
01:31:15 appreciate anyone who is like
01:31:18 I mean if you're if you're sitting there and you're like
01:31:21 Hmm bitcoin is definitely going to the moon
01:31:24 But I will abstain from buying it because I think that it would be morally wrong
01:31:30 Like I would I would uh, I would come I would commend you on your on your principled
01:31:37 Actions I would say that's a pretty impressive like moral sacrifice you
01:31:44 Are making or think you are making
01:31:49 I wouldn't
01:31:51 If I still like chicken nuggets and even though the meat industry sucks
01:31:55 I I don't know consider there's so many things I could be doing to like to make statements and stands about like how things are bad
01:32:03 And I will only do the good things
01:32:06 And it's I don't know it's too hard
01:32:08 Consider that consider this viewer say that if you threw all your money in bitcoin right now
01:32:13 And then a week like and then it was going to blow up and you were going to make $10,000
01:32:17 You were going to get $10,000 from bitcoin right if you did that
01:32:23 By not by not doing it. You are basically throwing away $10,000. So are you willing to just personally
01:32:30 throw away
01:32:33 10,000 of your of your dollar of your potential dollars to you know, not
01:32:38 inflict whatever
01:32:40 You know environmental damage would be done
01:32:44 By you know that amount of bitcoin transactions. I don't know exactly how much
01:32:50 that is
01:32:53 Unless unless I saw evidence that like it was
01:32:57 Really like doing like more than $10,000 worth of harm to the world. I probably would still do it
01:33:03 It's hard to quantify. Yeah, and it's it really would only it's like a lot of things if everybody
01:33:10 Had that attitude then there's the solution. I wouldn't sacrifice that would be there unless I knew everybody stopped using
01:33:17 Cryptocurrency and then everything's great. But of course
01:33:20 How do you influence everybody?
01:33:23 You don't you don't do that
01:33:26 By telling each person individually because you know, a lot of them are not going to
01:33:31 Agree and then the people who do agree
01:33:34 Not all of them are in like a good
01:33:36 Like the the best situation to change up their habits not necessarily just with crypto but with anything that like
01:33:43 Like like, you know eating meat or or doing this or that
01:33:47 Every it's it's not everybody's in the right position. Some people are and even then they might get lazy
01:33:54 it's it's
01:33:55 I feel
01:33:57 A waste of energy to go after individuals
01:34:00 To to you know to wipe your finger at them
01:34:04 and say
01:34:05 You're doing a bad thing
01:34:07 by giving legitimacy
01:34:09 yourself you only
01:34:13 I think there's but at the same time, I don't know what they could do instead that would
01:34:18 Reach more people because that's hard. Anyway, so it is I guess continue to I guess I can't I can't blame I can't blame anymore
01:34:26 I can't blame them. Yeah, I can't I can't
01:34:29 um
01:34:30 Next next voicemail is called caramella boy
01:34:34 three two one
01:34:37 Hey, pcp
01:34:38 I was in for a shitty day at work
01:34:40 But then something magical happened then said check out this stupid caramel dancing video by yannis Ali
01:34:48 And so I went and did that
01:34:50 And it was just a magical 40 minute trip. I was smiling the whole time. It was like I was in middle school again
01:34:57 When he said balsamic vinegar, I had like the biggest pog in front of my computer screen because I was like, oh my god
01:35:02 That's the joke from lucky star. It all makes sense now
01:35:05 and it was just
01:35:07 Exactly what I needed to make my day better
01:35:10 um, thank you so much ben for
01:35:13 Recommending such an amazing video and even though he's probably not going to hear this. Thank you so so much yannis Ali
01:35:20 That was an amazing video. You are a true god
01:35:23 Thank you pcp once again
01:35:26 caramella
01:35:27 The yannis Ali video is great yannis Ali has made a bunch of good videos. I think that's probably his best
01:35:34 Uh, it was definitely the most I've seen he did ones on like letters
01:35:39 and they're
01:35:41 Like I think that's the same guy right like like talking about the letter e or something
01:35:49 Maybe his numbers. Oh, yeah, he did he's done a bunch of videos about letters
01:35:54 He did a bunch of videos they seem like intellectual like oh, I guess I need to be a letter nerd
01:35:59 He has really appreciate this a bit, but he has moved more into um, he has moved more into, um,
01:36:08 Like more media stuff and more like youtube friendly stuff recently
01:36:14 Which is fine. His old his old stuff is pretty interesting, but it's very like
01:36:20 Who are you who are you gonna talk to you about like oh, I learned some interesting facts about the letter c today
01:36:27 Yeah, um
01:36:30 Yeah, uh next next voicemail is called who?
01:36:36 three two one go
01:36:39 Hey, I wanted to ask you guys the who would win where why of radcon
01:36:44 I'll start with the who on this week
01:36:47 Who do you guys think is going to show up if you do another radcon?
01:36:52 and also
01:36:53 Who are you going to name it after?
01:36:56 surely you can't keep it named radcon we could after trixie's dead name especially after trixie is kind of
01:37:03 Not friends with the show or the group. I don't I don't care about any maybe you keep it radcon's a cool name
01:37:10 Yes, but yeah, who do you think will show up and will you change the name?
01:37:13 if we did it
01:37:15 A name change maybe maybe if we wanted to I don't know to
01:37:20 possibly because like um
01:37:23 Being obviously I don't think a lot of the people
01:37:27 Who who used to come would want to come?
01:37:30 for various different reasons
01:37:32 Man she doesn't want to be on the internet anymore
01:37:35 uh
01:37:37 Trixie obviously is just gone and we don't like her so she's not invited
01:37:43 Tom would would would show up. I maybe Nate would show up probably if there was like it was nicely organized
01:37:51 and
01:37:52 potentially Jesse
01:37:54 But like as a stretch
01:37:57 I think if it was a big enough deal and we asked
01:38:00 He may show up at some point, but I I don't know. I have no idea what he feels about the state of the pcp at the moment
01:38:06 Wait, I'm being I'm being rude on twitter again. Oh god dang it
01:38:14 Okay, good. Um my um, I have spewed. I have spewed my bile
01:38:20 on twitter
01:38:22 And uh, I will probably continue to do so
01:38:25 um
01:38:25 Anyway, the next voicemail is called
01:38:28 addressing only the maddest niggas
01:38:31 Uh, okay three two one go
01:38:35 Few absolute maniacs who are really listening to the pcp from the start
01:38:40 Uh, could maybe just all of the kindness of your high
01:38:45 um compile
01:38:46 A list of all the times they talk about homestuck
01:38:51 Uh, or Andrew hersey
01:38:54 They send it to me
01:38:56 Or just, you know, put it on the comments. I would appreciate it very much
01:39:01 What does he really want for that info did you understand did you understand the question? What was the question?
01:39:08 Yeah, he was he's saying to
01:39:11 addressing like mad people in the pcp audience
01:39:14 If you could get all of the instances of the progress and they just talking about homestuck or Andrew
01:39:18 Hussie and then telling him in the comments all of them
01:39:22 I we talk about that's so many times over the entire
01:39:27 Like of the podcast so that's a lot of
01:39:30 timestamps
01:39:32 I don't know what they plan to do with it
01:39:38 Uh, I don't by the way, this this this is the guy that i'm pretty sure called into the anamorphon time
01:39:44 Podcast that one time this this is the voice that i'm almost positive
01:39:48 Called into the chris grinds episode of that. Uh, so if you've if you've heard that episode of anamorphon time
01:39:56 Let me know if you think it's the same guy. I'm pretty sure it's the same guy
01:39:59 um
01:40:00 Next voicemail is called boris j 3 2 1 go
01:40:07 Ben do you realize a lot of pcp viewers also listen to the dick show?
01:40:13 Uh, I'm sure some of them do
01:40:17 I feel like uh, what am I supposed to do about it the vast majority of those who
01:40:22 Enjoy the dick show probably don't enjoy the pcp, but maybe they do
01:40:26 Except when politics comes up. I don't know. I'm sure I'm sure there's some crossover. I mean, you know a lot of people who
01:40:35 Listen to the pcp were digi fans and digi shielded the the dick show a lot. So like yeah
01:40:42 I don't know man. What whatever
01:40:45 I don't agree. I don't like the dick show, but like
01:40:49 What's to be done?
01:40:52 uh
01:40:53 Next voicemail is a tweet. Um, here i'll i'll post the tweet in the
01:41:01 Server
01:41:02 Oh, is it um coming up? Why is it not a typo?
01:41:09 Uh, sorry the link doesn't work. Sorry, buddy. Let me try again. Um
01:41:14 Next next voicemail is called fuck Ralph
01:41:17 Three two one go. Huh? What you there?
01:41:21 That's good. Okay. Okay. Three two one go
01:41:25 So we don't have any friends. So I just decided to like ramble into the void
01:41:29 Aka like your ears
01:41:33 I just watched the Ralph the movie maker video about linkara and
01:41:38 I don't know about linkara. I don't know if he's like
01:41:41 Bad person or like cringe or base because I'm not the fucking nerd
01:41:47 But like that video that might as well be
01:41:50 like the
01:41:51 Ralph's embodiment of
01:41:53 Trixie going on that podcast and basically just projecting all over floors
01:41:59 Because this smug little asshole like he made four. I think four movies that all fucking suck
01:42:07 He charged like 20
01:42:09 30 dollars for them on blu-ray
01:42:11 Yeah, like funding for them and they fucking sucked ass and he has the audacity
01:42:17 To to mock like another person
01:42:20 for acting
01:42:22 badly
01:42:24 Like he acts any better that fucking rat face little fuck. I hope he's fucking
01:42:31 Wait, so you're talking about Ethan Ralph, right?
01:42:34 No, he's talking about Ralph the movie maker. Oh, he charged
01:42:38 So he charged 40 dollars for a shitty DVD of of what?
01:42:42 Of well movies he's made I guess
01:42:45 Oh
01:42:46 And yet and yet he courtesizes linkara's movie. I think
01:42:51 The hypocrisy I I don't feel like that's that's fine. Did linkara make a movie?
01:42:57 I guess
01:42:59 Well, I mean if this guy thinks that Ralph the movie maker made worse movies than linkara
01:43:04 Then I mean that's a pretty strong claim. Well, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I haven't seen linkara's movies
01:43:09 I kind of assume they're not good
01:43:12 Linkara is a bit of a cringe individual, but you know, they they make the type of
01:43:17 Things that their audience enjoys if this guy is saying that like
01:43:21 Linkara gave better value for money unlike the like he gave he gave it at a more reasonable price
01:43:27 and all that
01:43:30 I mean, I'm fair enough. I feel like this guy thinks that linkara gave a better product
01:43:35 Yeah, I I don't know. I think well, he says he doesn't know about linkara
01:43:42 So he's coming at it from like Ralph the movie maker makes bad movies and yet
01:43:46 criticizes them
01:43:48 Which I think is
01:43:49 It's I don't find that to be a problem if somebody makes a bad movie
01:43:53 I mean, I'd like red letter media and space cop was terrible
01:43:58 It was not a good movie and yet they they think they can talk about movies
01:44:02 Hmm. Yeah
01:44:08 I mean, you don't necessarily have to be you don't necessarily have to be a great movie a great filmmaker to criticize movie
01:44:14 You don't whatever they always say you don't have to be a great chef to like, you know, know if food tastes good or whatever
01:44:21 Uh, yeah, I mean
01:44:26 I don't know too much about Ralph the movie maker if two people make you good videos
01:44:31 So if two and biased, I guess
01:44:33 I've seen a couple Ralph the movie maker videos and I guess they're fine
01:44:37 Um, if two people each make a shitty movie and then they each point to each other's shitty movie and they're like that movie sucks
01:44:44 I guess they're both right
01:44:47 Yeah, they can both be right
01:44:50 Uh
01:44:51 Yeah
01:44:52 I don't know
01:44:54 Seems like linkara doesn't really
01:44:57 Criticize people a lot seems like linkara takes it personally
01:45:01 When like other internet people like say his stuff is bad and he like doesn't really do that he like
01:45:07 Gets pissy and like complains about other people who are like too critical seems to be
01:45:13 His thing but so which is which is okay. I mean it seems like he he doesn't dish it
01:45:18 Because he can't take it which is fair enough. Honestly, it's valid. It's perfectly valid
01:45:24 um
01:45:27 Okay
01:45:28 Yeah, I don't know. I haven't seen any of these movies. So I don't fucking know
01:45:32 um
01:45:33 Next voicemail is called ppr
01:45:36 pcp public radio
01:45:38 three two one go
01:45:42 From member station wflg. I'm sydney norman with your weekly roundup
01:45:46 This week's story the trial for kyle written house continued with an explosive day on wednesday as written house took the stand for cross examination
01:45:53 Written house began crying during his testimony describing how he improperly used a weapon
01:45:56 He intentionally brought with him to a volatile situation and the community is not a part of
01:46:00 This prompted judge bruce schroeder to admonish prosecuting attorney thomas binger for asking written house questions
01:46:06 Judge schroeder then called a recess and told written house to use quote bruce's big brave boy
01:46:11 And that written house earned an extra hour tv time that night
01:46:14 It wasn't long after the court had returned from recess that judge schroeder threatened to hold binger in contempt for referring to the individuals
01:46:19 Their in-house shot has people
01:46:22 Bitcoin up 4 3 i'm up 2 xrp up 2 this is bpr
01:46:28 Another another beautiful day in the neighborhood
01:46:33 Yeah, yeah, this is what i'm talking about
01:46:36 That was that was half factual and the part that wasn't factual was just was just extrapolating from the existing facts of the case
01:46:45 Uh, that's pretty much how it how it is
01:46:48 uh
01:46:49 bummer
01:46:51 Okay, next voicemail is called it's true
01:46:54 3 2 1 go
01:46:57 Shred it
01:47:01 Shred it what
01:47:04 Shred it raped my dog
01:47:07 What is that what they're saying? I think he's saying shredded raped my dog
01:47:12 Oh, yeah, I guess that they might be saying that
01:47:17 Uh, I guess it's true because they put four exclamation points. Yeah, that's what
01:47:21 That's what convinced me
01:47:25 Um next one is called
01:47:27 Okay, there's no voicemail. It's just called. Why is the header of the pcp website so
01:47:32 enormous
01:47:34 And the answer like that
01:47:36 I don't think that's true. The answer is that it's just like a default template and that's how big the template's header was
01:47:43 Uh
01:47:45 Yeah, we have a picture of a cactus
01:47:46 We have a picture of a succulent on our website because by the way
01:47:50 Okay, we got to change the the the description of the episodes because apparently the the episode descriptions still link to the like the um
01:47:57 the mp3
01:47:59 Like google drive folder, which is no longer updated if you want the episode mp3 is you got to go to the website now
01:48:05 The episode mp3s are all available on the website. That is where we upload them now. So we should change the description
01:48:11 Change there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
01:48:14 um
01:48:15 Okay, that's uh, that's that uh, next
01:48:19 Uh, one is called good morning
01:48:22 three two one go
01:48:25 I love you guys so much you guys. Uh, thanks, man
01:48:31 For years, I love you guys. We've been podcasting for years. My my my buddies
01:48:38 My part of social buddies. I love you. I hope you're a blessing a blessed Sunday
01:48:43 um happiness
01:48:45 health to your families
01:48:47 and to yourselves
01:48:49 um
01:48:50 Ben, I would like to know your thoughts on infinitely just in in the fossil walls
01:48:55 I know you comment about them before the podcast. I remember that and I know it's it's a comic, but I
01:49:03 I don't remember
01:49:05 The details or what you actually think about the the book and the fossil was I have the book in my hands right now
01:49:11 Um, kisses. I love you guys
01:49:19 The um, I have only I haven't read that much David Foster walls. I've read infinite jest and I've read um
01:49:26 One or two of his articles
01:49:28 Or his short stories rather like I read um
01:49:31 I think it's called like
01:49:33 A very fun thing. I'll never do again the one where he goes on the cruise ship
01:49:38 Uh, that one's kind of good
01:49:40 It's cool. I guess
01:49:42 um infinite jest
01:49:45 Oh, I've seen I've seen the movie
01:49:47 based on uh
01:49:50 Is it called um portraits of hideous men?
01:49:53 I haven't read that story, but I've I've I've seen the movie based on it and I
01:49:59 Thought it was all right
01:50:01 The infinite jest book is really long
01:50:04 It's probably too long
01:50:07 It it drags it points it took me like a whole year to read it
01:50:11 uh the the like
01:50:14 The thing with like the footnotes and like the huge indexes at the end is very it's pretty annoying actually like having to flip
01:50:21 Having to keep two bookmarks and like flip back and forth through
01:50:25 The whole book is very irritating. It doesn't I don't like it, but it is what it is
01:50:30 Uh, but like there's scenes from the book that I remember
01:50:34 Years later that I that I have retained and I found
01:50:38 Interesting, so I guess
01:50:40 I guess it was worth reading because it left me with
01:50:44 impressions
01:50:45 So would I recommend it?
01:50:47 Yeah, uh
01:50:51 What what else can I say it's uh it had interesting ideas in it even if it was pretty bloated
01:50:57 Oh, okay, uh next next voicemail is called ben saint
01:51:02 I don't know how to
01:51:06 I don't know how to speak french
01:51:08 three two one go
01:51:11 My accent is brazilian. You guys have uh, ben you have come down my accent one or two times. It's it's brazilian. I'm from brazil
01:51:23 I I thought it was south american, so I was in the right ballpark
01:51:28 um
01:51:29 Next
01:51:33 This reminds me in a in a mental game of telephone. I just played as my neurons were reaching out and touching each other and wriggling around
01:51:40 Uh, that reminds me that one of my roommates is brazilian
01:51:43 Which reminds me of one of my other roommates who I have never even barely talked to
01:51:48 Who I heard this week listening to tim pool
01:51:52 in the fucking kitchen
01:51:55 And tim pool was going on some unhinged, uh, kyle riddenhouse shit
01:52:00 And I just want to say
01:52:03 It makes me really mad and I hate that guy
01:52:06 Uh, that's all
01:52:08 I have to say about that. Oh
01:52:10 Oh, the the thing the title of that
01:52:14 Translates to I will eat your ass
01:52:17 If you come as sick. Oh
01:52:20 Yeah, that sounds
01:52:22 Oh, that must be portuguese then portuguese. Yes. Yeah, well
01:52:27 Because actually
01:52:30 Which is basically just which is basically just a mix of french and spanish as far as as far as I'm concerned
01:52:36 And I don't care to learn
01:52:37 Any more about it that might prove that wrong
01:52:41 Uh, it's spanish adjacent literally. I mean, yeah next one is an imjer link

01:54:07 Saying he was about to start streaming on twitch
01:54:10 My mouse hovered over the link for an uncomfortable amount of time before I worked up the courage to do something
01:54:16 That would have seemed impossible years ago
01:54:18 I unfollowed nate anyone who takes no nate november seriously should probably do the same
01:54:25 Unfollow and unsubscribe from nate
01:54:27 Stay strong no nate nation if and as always no nate. Yes watch if you if you are playing with fire
01:54:34 If you're still following nate if if you are serious about no nate november if you're serious about no nate november I would have to agree
01:54:42 Being subscribed and following is is definitely yeah playing with fire
01:54:47 There's uh, there's no there's no question there. Hey man, stay strong
