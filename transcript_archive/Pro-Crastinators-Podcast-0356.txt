00:00:00 I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:03 That son of a bitch.
00:00:04 Son of a bitch.
00:00:05 Son of a bitch.
00:00:06 Son of a bitch.
00:00:07 Son of a bitch.
00:00:08 Son of a bitch.
00:00:09 Son of a bitch.
00:00:10 Son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Son of a bitch.
00:00:12 Son of a bitch.
00:00:13 Well, it's been a week since no podcast.
00:00:16 Yeah, it was Easter Sunday.
00:00:19 I hope it's been worth it.
00:00:20 Sorry guys, that was my fault.
00:00:22 I'm the reason.
00:00:23 You rose from the grave.
00:00:24 I know, I know.
00:00:25 Yeah.
00:00:26 Dang.
00:00:27 Ben, what did you give up for Ash Wednesday?
00:00:31 Did you give up anything?
00:00:33 There's sort of Wednesday.
00:00:34 Smoking weed.
00:00:35 You did, huh?
00:00:36 Smoking weed for Ash Wednesday, yeah, I gave it up for my entire life, because Ash Wednesday
00:00:42 is just that important.
00:00:43 Every Wednesday, I give it up.
00:00:44 Your real ash, your real ash head.
00:00:47 Yeah, I used to be.
00:00:49 I put my blunt out on my forehead and I said, oh, there's no more.
00:00:55 I don't need it anymore.
00:00:57 You did.
00:00:58 You did a Dr. Manhattan thing where you drew the symbol on your forehead, but you used
00:01:02 the blunt and you made a weed leaf.
00:01:04 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:01:06 That's exactly right.
00:01:08 I drew the entire tetrahedra canna binol molecule, a complicated diagram, I'll do it.
00:01:15 I'll do a symbol that better represents me.
00:01:19 It will be one I respect for 20.
00:01:23 Recently.
00:01:24 It will be one I respect draws the Tesla logo.
00:01:27 Recently a passenger, a Lyft passenger gave me a weed.
00:01:30 He gave me free weed.
00:01:33 That's spectacular.
00:01:34 And a jar, just because.
00:01:35 That's, yeah.
00:01:36 Because you were based?
00:01:38 Yeah, pretty much.
00:01:39 It seems like a bad business model.
00:01:41 It seems like you're losing money doing such a thing.
00:01:43 As long as you got it in addition to payment, well, you can't jump into the car until you
00:01:51 actually pay for the app.
00:01:53 Like the app has your cards or your paint anyway, you know, so you're going to give
00:01:59 me money anyway.
00:02:01 And he is, I guess I was just talking to him about society.
00:02:03 I was telling him about society and the problem with society is kind of like this guy's kind
00:02:08 of based as you get some weed and it works out perfectly because I ran out.
00:02:14 So yep.
00:02:15 It does work.
00:02:16 It does work out perfectly.
00:02:17 Got refilled.
00:02:18 Yep.
00:02:19 Life be like that sometimes.
00:02:22 She gets sugar.
00:02:23 No.
00:02:24 I don't need sugar.
00:02:25 Sugar high.
00:02:26 That's what I'm chasing.
00:02:28 Yeah.
00:02:29 Yeah.
00:02:30 No more weed now.
00:02:32 Only sugar.
00:02:34 Just glucose.
00:02:36 What's it called?
00:02:37 Glucose.
00:02:38 Glucose.
00:02:39 I tried.
00:02:40 Okay.
00:02:41 Glucose heads.
00:02:42 In my pursuit of a perfect licorice, I changed my strategy up and I have created something
00:02:51 called rather than you sugar like a fucking moron, I've created invert sugar.
00:02:56 Do you know what that is?
00:02:58 Salt.
00:02:59 Yeah.
00:03:00 Invert sugar.
00:03:01 Yeah.
00:03:02 I've created anti-sugar.
00:03:04 Okay.
00:03:05 It's actually, it sounds less complicated than it is.
00:03:10 It's just you put sugar in water.
00:03:13 You ever make rock candy?
00:03:14 You know how when you put sugar in water and then you cook it down, it like crystallizes?
00:03:17 Yeah.
00:03:18 I have not done that, but I know that, yes.
00:03:20 Okay.
00:03:21 Yeah.
00:03:22 Well, if you add a little bit of acid, I guess it like changes, it like reverses the molecular
00:03:27 structure or something.
00:03:28 It changes the molecular structure such that it does not do that anymore.
00:03:33 And that's how you can, you can cook sugar down into like a thick, gloopy syrup.
00:03:38 Down into what, down into what we confectioners call the softball stage of sugar reduction.
00:03:45 So shut up.
00:03:46 Shut the hell up.
00:03:47 It's not funny.
00:03:51 So yes.
00:03:52 They're so fucking silly.
00:03:53 These p√¢tissiers look down their nose at me.
00:03:57 So I cooked, yes, I made a jar of a softball stage invert sugar and I tried making licorice.
00:04:03 I tried making a Twizzler with it.
00:04:05 It was still too soft, but it was much smoother.
00:04:07 Do you believe it?
00:04:08 It was much smoother than what the ones I had done with refined sugar.
00:04:14 So that's an improvement.
00:04:16 Yeah.
00:04:17 Yeah.
00:04:18 You're kind of like a senior citizen, Ben.
00:04:22 Wow, I really thought you were going to say you're like Walter White because everyone
00:04:26 says, wow, Ben, you're like Walter White.
00:04:28 Oh yeah, I bet you want me to compare you to Walter White.
00:04:30 I bet you love it.
00:04:31 You'd be like the eighth person to do it, so, you know.
00:04:36 Is that because you don't have any hair anymore?
00:04:38 Because I have no hair and because I make concoctions in the kitchen.
00:04:43 You live in New Mexico.
00:04:44 I live in New Mexico.
00:04:45 I have cancer.
00:04:47 Yeah.
00:04:48 That's an upcoming.
00:04:50 My wife hates me.
00:04:52 Yeah, true.
00:04:53 Your wife does hate you.
00:04:55 Did he ever do any rapes?
00:04:57 Did he ever do any rapes?
00:04:59 No.
00:05:00 He did in a sexual assault.
00:05:02 I remember that.
00:05:03 Against Skyler?
00:05:04 On Skyler?
00:05:05 Yeah.
00:05:06 Well, you know.
00:05:07 She was pregnant.
00:05:08 She didn't want it and she was just going too hard.
00:05:12 He thought he could get a horny tie whenever he wanted.
00:05:15 Yeah.
00:05:16 And he's kind of like a wife consent matters.
00:05:18 I'm a cool gang banger drug dealer now.
00:05:21 You have to respect me and, you know.
00:05:23 Yeah.
00:05:24 Yeah.
00:05:25 Yeah.
00:05:26 Breaking Bad is pretty cool like that, where it's like, yeah, you know, nerds kind of do
00:05:29 ruin everything when you think about it.
00:05:32 Especially like, you know, drug, drug dealing.
00:05:35 They ruin it.
00:05:36 They should stay with the kitchen.
00:05:37 Not me though.
00:05:38 Not you.
00:05:39 No, you're different.
00:05:40 Not me though.
00:05:41 Not me though.
00:05:43 You know that roller coaster that is designed to kill you?
00:05:50 You mean Phantom's Revenge?
00:05:52 No.
00:05:53 Sure.
00:05:54 That's a roller coaster of an experience reading that.
00:05:57 No, you'll be dead by the end of it.
00:05:59 No, there's an actual roller coaster called Phantom's Revenge.
00:06:03 Oh, I don't know if it's called.
00:06:05 It's not called Phantom's Revenge.
00:06:07 I know the thing he's talking about.
00:06:08 It pre-exists the video game.
00:06:09 It pre-exists the famous video game.
00:06:12 Okay, no, not that one, because the one I'm talking about doesn't exist.
00:06:16 It's like a hypothetical, like designed roller coaster.
00:06:19 It's the thing that everybody makes in like roller coaster tycoon as soon as they boot
00:06:23 up the game.
00:06:24 Yeah, basically.
00:06:25 What?
00:06:26 It's like, let me, I'll look for an image for it, but it's basically has like a huge
00:06:30 ass like ramp that goes straight up into the air and it has like, it has like enough
00:06:34 apparently like the loops number that it chooses is enough to straight up kill you.
00:06:39 I saw someone tweeted out recently with the caption, yeah, I would survive this.
00:06:44 Oh, is it the one where like the loops get smaller and smaller and like the centrifugal
00:06:48 force gets higher and higher and eventually turns you into a milkshake?
00:06:52 Yeah, it starts really tall and it goes like a pigtail.
00:06:57 Yeah, I would survive.
00:06:59 I just wouldn't let it kill me.
00:07:02 Yeah.
00:07:03 Mr. Beast should invent, like create that with his money and then people can see how cool
00:07:09 they are by surviving the euthanasia coaster.
00:07:12 That'd be some good content.
00:07:14 Mr. Beast should put transphobes in it.
00:07:17 I bet it's a painless way to go.
00:07:19 I bet you passed out well before.
00:07:21 Do you feel it when you get turned into a milkshake?
00:07:25 Is that a feeling, you know?
00:07:27 I think you'd have passed out well before it happened.
00:07:31 There we go.
00:07:32 But yeah, basically it's this.
00:07:36 This is a graph of how you would feel.
00:07:39 In fact, you feel really like really good right at the top and then very quickly becomes
00:07:46 powerful.
00:07:47 And then quit, you would alternate rapidly.
00:07:49 You would feel good and bad alternating until you're dead.
00:07:51 It kind of reminds you of what it is like.
00:07:53 We're not even sure that if you drop the thumbnails really funny.
00:07:56 We're not even sure that if you drop a human into a black hole, they'll even feel it.
00:08:00 We're not exactly sure what's going to fucking happen to you.
00:08:04 Yeah, like if your brain is halfway through the event horizon, do the neurons firing even
00:08:09 reach the other part of you?
00:08:11 Is that like, is it just like, dude, what the fuck?
00:08:17 I always thought that's a really cool way to go.
00:08:20 There was some sort of anime where they defeat the final guy by dropping his ass into a black hole.
00:08:25 And he's just getting stretched beyond infinite.
00:08:30 And is he even feeling it?
00:08:32 Is it even like he's in this in between state of alive or dead?
00:08:38 It's so confusing.
00:08:42 I've tried to wrap my head around.
00:08:44 I've seen so many YouTube videos trying to explain what you would feel at the edge of
00:08:49 a black hole going into it because time stops.
00:08:55 Well, time dilates.
00:08:58 Dilates to a point where it basically is like you don't perceive anything happening.
00:09:04 So would you just be sitting there?
00:09:06 No, your time would be relatively dilated compared to an outside observer.
00:09:14 I mean, you would experience time for yourself moving normally.
00:09:19 But then like, you know, time would be moving really fast like outside of the event horizon.
00:09:24 You'd be falling in and you'd see like the universe die like outside.
00:09:30 You'd see like the entire universe die.
00:09:33 Well, you wouldn't see anything because light couldn't get in.
00:09:35 Well, no, it can get in though.
00:09:37 It can get in. It just can't get out.
00:09:39 Interesting.
00:09:41 That's so cool.
00:09:42 So like all the photons are like flying in and you've got to like catch them with your eyeball.
00:09:46 Otherwise they'll pass you into the infinite nothing.
00:09:49 Yeah.
00:09:50 It's the little game.
00:09:52 You've got to see how many photons you can catch.
00:09:54 That's right.
00:09:56 Black holes can like get full, can't they?
00:09:59 And then they explode.
00:10:01 No.
00:10:02 When they get full, they go, oh, I'm so full.
00:10:04 Oh, I'm so fast.
00:10:06 They're stunk.
00:10:07 Wrong.
00:10:08 No.
00:10:09 I don't think I can eat anymore.
00:10:10 They can't get full, but they can get empty.
00:10:13 Yeah.
00:10:14 What's the thing with the...
00:10:16 It's like a big swoosh of energy like escaping a black hole and making it shrink.
00:10:22 Like the matter inside of it is escaping as some sort of a thing.
00:10:26 It's not a big swoosh.
00:10:28 It's a very gradual process of, oh, what's the thing?
00:10:32 There's a certain kind of radiation that a black hole does emit.
00:10:35 And a black hole can eventually like radiate away all of its mass.
00:10:41 That's cool.
00:10:42 Which you would think it couldn't do, but it does.
00:10:47 I would survive a black hole.
00:10:48 But it's really slow.
00:10:49 I could probably survive a black hole.
00:10:52 Yeah, I played out to wilds.
00:10:54 I know my way around a black hole.
00:10:56 Yeah, I could escape.
00:10:57 Hawking radiation, hawking radiation.
00:11:00 Deep radiation.
00:11:01 Hypothetical particles formed by a black hole's boundary.
00:11:04 Yeah, so I could hypothetically survive is what you're saying.
00:11:08 So you're saying it's not 100%.
00:11:13 What if things named after people were named after their first name instead of their last name?
00:11:19 Steve's radiation.
00:11:21 Steven radiation.
00:11:22 That's like Steven Universe.
00:11:24 Yeah, Steven radiation is Steven.
00:11:27 Yo.
00:11:29 And like Newtons would be Isaacs.
00:11:32 The force of 20 Isaacs.
00:11:35 I guess it wouldn't change that many things.
00:11:37 But I just like the idea that it could be a force that is measured in jobs.
00:11:40 A more casual.
00:11:41 That'd be a pretty funny kind of like naming convention.
00:11:44 That'd be a pretty funny alternate reality where everything is the same.
00:11:46 It's just that now we just name things based off people's first names.
00:11:49 And that's just like the one difference.
00:11:51 Yeah.
00:11:53 So like the capital of the United States is just called George as is the state.
00:11:59 Yeah.
00:12:00 I remember there was one story.
00:12:03 I probably mentioned this before about alternate realities.
00:12:06 And the one difference between the reality they jump into is that Bob Dylan didn't create the stage name Bob Dylan.
00:12:13 He just uses regular name instead.
00:12:17 Sad.
00:12:18 A very disturbing universe.
00:12:20 An evil universe, if you will.
00:12:24 Yeah.
00:12:25 Hey, I watched a movie.
00:12:26 Hey, I watched a movie over Easter.
00:12:28 No way.
00:12:29 Nate showed me this great film.
00:12:32 You might have heard of it.
00:12:33 It's called RRR.
00:12:34 Are you familiar?
00:12:35 Oh yeah.
00:12:36 I heard it's really good and it's three hours long.
00:12:40 It is three hours long.
00:12:42 It should have been longer.
00:12:44 What is what is this film?
00:12:46 I've heard it is an it is an Indian action drama.
00:12:52 Well, it's like about it's sort of about like real life Indian people.
00:12:59 But it's like a fictionalized version of their lives where it's like they never knew each other in real life.
00:13:06 But the movie is like what if they did meet each other and they were best bros for life and they had anime superpowers.
00:13:15 And it's so good.
00:13:17 It's so cool.
00:13:18 There's there's big like it's not technically a Bollywood movie because it was made in a different language.
00:13:26 It's made in the Telugu language, which is not Hindi.
00:13:30 So it's it's something called Tollywood.
00:13:32 But you know, it's whatever.
00:13:34 It's an Indian movie and it and it's got those Bollywood style like big like Indian dance numbers just in the middle of like action scenes or like just whatever.
00:13:46 There's just a whole bunch of them and it's just so it's so earnest.
00:13:51 It's like to a Western to my Western sensibility.
00:13:55 It just comes off as having like absolutely no sense of like irony or like self consciousness about just like just have the characters do a big stupid dance number after they, you know, have a big battle or whatever.
00:14:14 Wait, but how am I supposed to know when to laugh?
00:14:16 The characters look at the camera and say, um, that just happened.
00:14:20 Um, that just happened.
00:14:21 You're always supposed to be laughing.
00:14:23 You're always laughing.
00:14:25 That's the that's the goal.
00:14:27 The job of the person next to you whenever you're watching it.
00:14:31 Yeah, he's supposed to poke you in the shoulder and say, did you see that?
00:14:35 That just happened.
00:14:36 Yeah.
00:14:37 Yeah.
00:14:38 Yeah.
00:14:39 Please laugh.
00:14:40 We don't need we don't need Joss Whedon telling us that just happened.
00:14:43 You're you're annoying friend in the theater.
00:14:46 Can just be did you see what just happened and you go?
00:14:48 Yeah, shut up.
00:14:49 Trying to watch the movie.
00:14:53 Did you just happen there dancing?
00:14:55 Can you believe that?
00:15:01 I don't know.
00:15:02 I want to like gush about it.
00:15:03 I want to like, I want to like spoil it.
00:15:04 I want to tell you all the all the amazing things that happen in RRR.
00:15:09 But like the emotions instead, maybe of like what?
00:15:14 Which experience?
00:15:16 It's it's would you say it's like funny bad good or like actually brilliant?
00:15:22 It's not it's not.
00:15:23 No, it's not bad at all.
00:15:24 It in no way is it bad at all.
00:15:26 Like none of none of my enjoyment of it was ironic.
00:15:29 Like I was I was laughing with the movie because it was very silly at times.
00:15:35 I like those.
00:15:36 But it's silly in a way that just made me clap.
00:15:38 It just made me clap and go just maybe clap and jump out of my seat and go.
00:15:41 Yes.
00:15:42 Yes.
00:15:45 Sounds sounds good.
00:15:46 How do you spell it?
00:15:47 Is it just the letter?
00:15:48 It's the letter RRR.
00:15:50 I guess it technically stands for rise roar revolt.
00:15:57 In them, but in the move in the movie, there's like there's there's like chapter beginning that are like.
00:16:03 Okay, so the characters are like it starts with one that's like story and the R is big in story.
00:16:11 And then they introduce this one character who is the fire and the R is big.
00:16:15 And then there's another character who's the water and the R is big.
00:16:20 But that's not what the R stands for.
00:16:22 It's awesome.
00:16:23 They just like our they just they just like the R is there a pirate that goes R.
00:16:28 There is not a pirate.
00:16:29 Oh, there is not a pirate.
00:16:31 I'm sorry.
00:16:32 I really do want to watch it.
00:16:34 But there is a jungle man.
00:16:39 There is a jungle man.
00:16:40 Which is like a pirate.
00:16:43 Jungle man.
00:16:44 Jungle children.
00:16:46 You know, children from the jungle.
00:16:49 Children from a book.
00:16:52 I'm trying to think of what can I even what can I say without the without.
00:16:56 What can I say that hasn't already been said?
00:16:58 Would you say the unforgettable moments?
00:17:00 Would you say that your hatred of people with melanin?
00:17:02 Like you probably change your mind on it.
00:17:04 Like you probably like people with melanin now.
00:17:06 It made me.
00:17:07 It made me think maybe they have a chance.
00:17:10 Maybe maybe they maybe maybe there's something to these.
00:17:14 Maybe there's something to these brown people.
00:17:17 Maybe maybe some brown people are cool.
00:17:20 You know, sometimes like how some white people are cool sometimes.
00:17:23 You know, the movies basically about how white people are bad.
00:17:26 True base.
00:17:27 This is very woke.
00:17:28 This is very, very woke film.
00:17:31 That's awesome.
00:17:32 Kind of reminds me how every time I pick up a passenger who's like Indian or like a darker shade of skin.
00:17:39 I raise my fist in a brown power.
00:17:42 I tell him, you know, have a brown pride.
00:17:45 United together.
00:17:46 You pull out.
00:17:47 You know that shot of the guy hold in family guy, the guy holding out the skin color guide.
00:17:53 Yeah.
00:17:54 That's like if you're lighter than this, you're a tourist.
00:17:56 If you're darker than this, you're a terrorist or something.
00:17:58 Yeah.
00:17:59 You pull it.
00:18:00 You make it.
00:18:01 You make a fist.
00:18:02 You pull out the guide.
00:18:03 If you're lighter than this, you punch them.
00:18:05 And if you're darker than this, you fist bump.
00:18:07 Nice.
00:18:08 I think I think it I think it makes a lot of sense.
00:18:12 Cheesy.
00:18:13 Were you the driver in that story?
00:18:15 Yeah.
00:18:17 Oh, I thought I thought the driver gave gave you weed.
00:18:20 And I thought that seems a bit odd.
00:18:23 You know, I'm I was the driver.
00:18:25 The passenger gave me weed.
00:18:27 That's nice.
00:18:28 Yeah.
00:18:29 I mean, I thought it was either way.
00:18:30 Yeah.
00:18:31 So, you know, I got I got paid and I got weed, which is pretty great.
00:18:34 Because I kind of, you know, I'm low.
00:18:38 I'm probably not going to smoke it until like I do another round of pre-orders.
00:18:43 That's usually trying to get really stressed out.
00:18:47 It counts.
00:18:49 The I just OK, give remember when you and Munchie reviewed s cry Ed and you did a terrible job and you completely and you
00:18:59 completely like a normal person would and I was like, huh, what's going on?
00:19:03 You watched it.
00:19:04 You want first of all, the whole premise of three episodes terrible.
00:19:07 You literally did not even get to understand what the show is about.
00:19:11 The show is about.
00:19:14 Unlikely video, how to tell a bad anime from one episode.
00:19:19 We will give us we would be in generous.
00:19:22 S cry Ed.
00:19:23 S cry Ed is about an unlikely bromance between the two biggest badasses in the world and they're opposing
00:19:31 ideological philosophies.
00:19:34 And you didn't even get to that part.
00:19:36 But that's but that's what RRR is like.
00:19:39 It's like s cry Ed, but Indian and good, actually, even though I like s cry Ed.
00:19:45 So, yeah.
00:19:48 I don't know.
00:19:49 There's there's you'll be you'll be sold in the field be sold in the first 15 minutes.
00:19:54 If you if you turn it on, I think there's a establishes right out the gate.
00:19:59 What kind of movie are in for?
00:20:00 I really can't really can't say enough good things about it.
00:20:03 It showed me that movies can be good, actually.
00:20:05 Nice.
00:20:06 That's that was me when I watched the Mario movie.
00:20:09 I was like, oh, movies can be good now.
00:20:12 I guess it JK.
00:20:14 I guess it won a an Oscar despite being from India.
00:20:18 It won an American won an Oscar for like one of the musical numbers in a fair world.
00:20:24 It probably it should have been like up for like best picture.
00:20:27 I mean, I'm no expert.
00:20:29 I mean, it was it was my movie of 2023, even though it came out last year, I guess.
00:20:35 But it would probably it would have been my movie of 2022 as well.
00:20:39 You haven't seen them.
00:20:40 You haven't seen everything everywhere.
00:20:42 All at once.
00:20:43 You know, I did see it.
00:20:45 No, I liked our no, I definitely liked our better than everything everywhere.
00:20:49 Everything everywhere was like fine.
00:20:51 It was good.
00:20:52 I enjoyed it.
00:20:53 I thought it was very I thought it was a very twee twee, which I am not a huge fan of.
00:20:58 Damn.
00:20:59 I thought the met I thought the metaphor was a little strained.
00:21:03 You know, it was OK.
00:21:05 It was good.
00:21:06 It's a good movie.
00:21:07 Yeah, I really liked everything everywhere.
00:21:10 You must prefer RR is even better than must be a good year for movies.
00:21:15 Ben clearly has a favorite of Asian.
00:21:17 He prefers East Asians.
00:21:19 I feel like I feel like everything everywhere.
00:21:23 I don't know.
00:21:24 It felt like it was really trying to like tell you something like it really thought it had some something to say.
00:21:30 RRR doesn't have anything to say except India fucking rules and fuck the British and well, that's an anime is awesome.
00:21:40 It's probably got something to say.
00:21:43 It does.
00:21:44 Yeah, it definitely does.
00:21:48 The end of the movie is like a big dance.
00:21:51 It's like a big dance scene and even like and the director of the movie starts dancing with all the characters.
00:21:58 While like pictures of like Indian like political like revolutionary figures like are like scrolling by in the background.
00:22:06 Yeah, no, the movies the movies got politics that I don't understand because I don't know who these people are.
00:22:11 That's really cool.
00:22:12 It is pretty cool.
00:22:14 I wish more people would do that where like they would the cast and crew would start dancing.
00:22:22 That it was cool.
00:22:23 It's like it's like it's like it's very silly.
00:22:26 They don't do that in America.
00:22:28 They don't do that in Hollywood movies.
00:22:30 Yeah.
00:22:31 They like imagine if the imagine if the Avengers just started like doing like an Irish jig.
00:22:36 They just all started doing like a big jig.
00:22:38 But Ben, you never you never seen the show a peacemaker because that's the intro of the show is them.
00:22:46 Is all the cast members doing like dancing to a glam rock song.
00:22:49 It's a pretty good intro.
00:22:51 Cool.
00:22:52 Yeah.
00:22:53 Cool.
00:22:54 I like it.
00:22:56 Okay.
00:22:57 I'll watch our just three hours.
00:23:00 So busy.
00:23:01 I can't I can't recommend it enough.
00:23:04 It's it's three it's three hours.
00:23:06 It felt like it felt like two or one hour per hour.
00:23:10 One hour per hour.
00:23:11 That's right.
00:23:14 Didn't did.
00:23:15 Yeah, earned every minute of it.
00:23:17 I would I would even watch it again.
00:23:19 I don't like rewatch movies, but I would I would watch it again.
00:23:23 That's how that's how serious I am about the quality of this film.
00:23:27 Ben rewatching a movie.
00:23:29 I know.
00:23:30 I know.
00:23:31 That's that's how serious.
00:23:33 I can't wait.
00:23:34 Is that John Cena?
00:23:35 Yeah, John Cena's peacemaker.
00:23:38 His mask is on crooked.
00:23:40 His face is no the mask is straight.
00:23:42 The face is crooked.
00:23:44 Yeah, I love this intro.
00:23:46 It's pretty good.
00:23:48 I forget the name of the kind of like animation where there's like a little
00:23:52 there's like anime characters.
00:23:54 People use it when they kind of make like little Miku music videos,
00:23:58 but I wish someone would like create a template out of this and you can just
00:24:01 put your characters dancing to it or something.
00:24:04 I think it I just think it would work perfectly and probably catch on.
00:24:08 But alas, I do not have the time.
00:24:11 I'm watching this peacemaker opening credits.
00:24:15 I will say RRR has better moves.
00:24:18 Definitely.
00:24:19 Not bad.
00:24:20 You know, these are all white people.
00:24:22 These are all white people, unfortunately.
00:24:24 This is white culture.
00:24:26 This is white.
00:24:27 Well, glam rock is like a pretty pretty white.
00:24:31 That's that's true.
00:24:33 There's one there's one.
00:24:35 Unfortunately, the one blemish on the on RRR is that there is one good white.
00:24:40 Nice.
00:24:41 But she's not but she's not that important.
00:24:43 There's only one good white person kind of like in Black Panther.
00:24:46 They have they have a good white CIA member.
00:24:49 She's there's one there's one good British person and it's a lady who is
00:24:55 maybe the maybe the maybe the dumbest part of the movie.
00:24:59 Damn.
00:25:00 Maybe the part that I think is the dumbest, but it's OK.
00:25:03 It's fine.
00:25:04 That's funny.
00:25:07 She is nice and but she gets she gets to dance.
00:25:10 So, you know, good for her.
00:25:11 That's good.
00:25:12 Yeah, I feel I feel represented.
00:25:15 Um, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
00:25:20 Shut up.
00:25:21 Okay.
00:25:22 You got nothing to say.
00:25:23 Don't say duh.
00:25:24 All right.
00:25:25 That's the end of the episode.
00:25:26 Goodbye.
00:25:27 I got nothing.
00:25:28 I got nothing.
00:25:29 I want to talk about comics for a little bit.
00:25:32 Little bit of those comics have been working on Clarissa chapter five now,
00:25:37 but it's been a little bit of rocky.
00:25:40 I've I've I've gotten, you know, I don't know what it was.
00:25:45 I put the first volume on Amazon.com and I got some purchases and it was so cool.
00:25:52 And I was just sort of looking at that.
00:25:54 And then, you know, the the money stopped, you know, the people stopped buying it.
00:26:00 I'm like, OK, so that's the people who know about it.
00:26:02 They've got it.
00:26:03 I should probably like try to market it more often, make some noise about it.
00:26:09 Yeah.
00:26:10 As I'm working.
00:26:11 Yeah.
00:26:12 And I was like, I don't know why this was so strangely difficult.
00:26:17 I think it might be an ADHD thing.
00:26:20 I've heard like this sort of thing is might be an ADHD sort of thing.
00:26:27 But like, I was I was having this plan of like going to post every page from Clarissa
00:26:35 Facebook on my Twitter and Tumblr and Instagram, just posting the page one per day and then
00:26:42 having a link to where you can read it and buy stuff.
00:26:46 And I'm like, I could schedule tweets like that.
00:26:48 I could just put them all up there.
00:26:51 And that would be so easy.
00:26:52 It would be the easiest thing in the world.
00:26:54 And I don't know why I couldn't do it.
00:26:57 I was just it was staring me in the face.
00:26:59 It was like the most the least amount of work I could do.
00:27:02 You'd have to schedule several hundred tweets.
00:27:05 Right.
00:27:06 Like it's more like 60 67 at this point.
00:27:11 But like it's like for you post four pages for each tweet and just put it in a thread.
00:27:18 I could do that.
00:27:19 But then it would be less.
00:27:21 It would be less.
00:27:22 I mean, it's probably a smarter thing to have more more pages.
00:27:27 But I don't know.
00:27:28 Some pages are not that interesting.
00:27:30 But I think one page just because if they're too small, then like you can't see them when
00:27:35 you're scrolling past the small thumbnails.
00:27:37 And I think one page is fine.
00:27:39 That's that's not I mean, that's like probably going to take you like a couple hours to do
00:27:43 like 67.
00:27:44 Well, it's not that easy.
00:27:47 I mean, no, but like even doing one, I was thinking, OK, well, maybe if I don't schedule
00:27:52 them, maybe if I just put one up to get the ball rolling and I couldn't do it, I was like
00:27:57 sort of freaking out.
00:27:59 It was a weird experience.
00:28:01 Did you not want did you not actually want to do it?
00:28:04 I wanted to do it and it was it would be so easy.
00:28:07 And like every bone in my body was saying, nah, and I don't I didn't get it.
00:28:14 It was very odd.
00:28:16 And so I had a sort of maybe I was depressed.
00:28:19 I didn't even really feel like I was.
00:28:23 But I've been slowly grinding my bones into a fine mist.
00:28:28 And now I'm getting back to doing some some actual line art for the new chapter, at least
00:28:34 that something is getting done.
00:28:36 That's good.
00:28:37 I I did not I did not finish Biscopades.
00:28:42 Like I said, I might I did do some more.
00:28:45 But I didn't I didn't finish it.
00:28:48 You were talking in the chat like the chapter is nearly done.
00:28:51 What did you mean by that?
00:28:53 In the chat.
00:28:55 Just a few minutes ago before the few minutes ago.
00:28:59 In the DM to me.
00:29:01 Almost done with the new chapter.
00:29:03 Of one piece.
00:29:05 Oh, whoops.
00:29:07 No, I have I have some more Biscopades page.
00:29:10 I think I have like.
00:29:13 Seven more pages or something.
00:29:18 Didn't didn't didn't get to spend all my time working on them this past two weeks.
00:29:23 Like I maybe it would have liked to.
00:29:26 But, you know, it's getting there.
00:29:30 No, I know I was talking about the one piece chapter, which I has been out for a while.
00:29:35 It's been out for a while.
00:29:36 There was a break last week.
00:29:38 So by the time this episode comes out, there'll be a chapter.
00:29:41 That we will not talk about.
00:29:44 Great.
00:29:46 Good scheduling.
00:29:48 We're really, we're really, we're really on the ball.
00:29:50 I guess we should we should mention why there was no episode because we didn't actually say.
00:29:54 I just wasn't here.
00:29:56 You weren't here for, I guess I assume Easter meetup or something.
00:30:01 I went to my family house for Easter and I wasn't at my computer.
00:30:05 Yeah.
00:30:06 And I could have done a gift cusp.
00:30:08 I didn't really feel like it.
00:30:10 I was also celebrating and mostly.
00:30:14 I like now that the weather has changed a little bit.
00:30:17 Yeah.
00:30:18 And I just wanted to spend my whole Sunday just lying in sunbeams.
00:30:21 I wanted to go outside and have the sun on my face.
00:30:25 And I would look up at to it with my eyes closed and be like, oh, yes.
00:30:29 Yes.
00:30:30 Oh, yeah.
00:30:31 Oh, yeah.
00:30:32 It was winter.
00:30:33 That's the best feeling.
00:30:34 It was winter like four days ago and then three days ago.
00:30:37 It was like 80 degrees at night.
00:30:39 I was walking around in a t-shirt in shorts in the evening.
00:30:44 Yeah.
00:30:45 That's too hot.
00:30:46 It didn't feel like 80.
00:30:48 During the day it was kind of hot, but it didn't feel like 80 at night.
00:30:53 The weather said it was, but it was like walk around comfortably in t-shirt weather.
00:30:59 It was great.
00:31:00 Now it's not that one.
00:31:02 It's a little bit breezy.
00:31:04 It's a bit like a random storm will come through and hail.
00:31:08 And then it'll be like five minutes later.
00:31:10 It'll be nice and bright and sunny.
00:31:12 It's been a nice time to be outside and looking up at the clouds and be like, oh,
00:31:17 imagine if there was a skypea up there or something.
00:31:20 Imagine if there's a skypea at me.
00:31:23 That's like, you know those pictures that are like regular people versus creative people?
00:31:29 Yeah.
00:31:30 Oh, yeah.
00:31:31 And they just have like a bit of hair dye.
00:31:34 It's like the creative person, it's like the girl is watching her chicken roast in the
00:31:39 oven, but the creative girl has pink hair and is imagining that a dragon is cooking
00:31:44 the chicken in the oven with its fire breath.
00:31:47 That's you, creative people.
00:31:49 Yeah.
00:31:50 It's like you.
00:31:51 I look at big clouds and I'm like, oh, yeah.
00:31:53 So cool.
00:31:54 What if there was a man living on them?
00:31:56 What if there was a little guy up there?
00:31:58 I mean, unironically though, sometimes a cloud looks like you could climb it.
00:32:02 It's a snowy mountain.
00:32:03 Sure.
00:32:04 And that's, I just like looking at it.
00:32:06 I just like drooling, like dumb, like duh, like looking up.
00:32:12 That's me.
00:32:14 That's where I want to be in life.
00:32:18 Well, you can't.
00:32:19 What a creative person.
00:32:22 Yeah, that's so creative of you.
00:32:24 I'm so creative.
00:32:28 Normal people look down at their shoes all day.
00:32:31 They don't look up.
00:32:32 They don't see the real world.
00:32:34 Normal people look down at their phone and watch pornography.
00:32:41 Like Pokemon pornography.
00:32:43 Yes.
00:32:44 Yes.
00:32:45 Disgusting.
00:32:46 Kids these days are more interested in seeing Pikachu choke on a 12 inch cop instead of
00:32:52 looking at the sky where the real beauty lies.
00:32:59 They look up and see God choking on a 12 inch cop.
00:33:04 It's like it says in the Bible.
00:33:08 Oh, the beautiful bird song.
00:33:11 Beautiful bird dong.
00:33:15 Man, I'm not in any comics.
00:33:19 I think the last one I drew was my Jesus comic for Easter.
00:33:23 You know what you haven't done, Cheesy?
00:33:26 What?
00:33:27 I haven't done my voice in Pagliacci.
00:33:30 Where's the voice Pagliacci?
00:33:32 I'm working on it.
00:33:33 You were so in a rush.
00:33:34 You're like, Ben, you got to give me that voice.
00:33:37 If I don't get that voice, it's going to throw a wrench in the whole works.
00:33:41 I did say.
00:33:42 And I slaved over it.
00:33:44 I did say those.
00:33:45 Those were my exact words.
00:33:46 Yes, that's true.
00:33:47 Just for you.
00:33:48 Just to keep this machine well oiled and running.
00:33:50 But then what you got to understand is that I owe I owe money to Fredo taxes.
00:33:56 And I'm currently doing double shift over here so I can pay them.
00:34:00 Fuck.
00:34:01 Yeah, I forgot it's tax.
00:34:03 It's tax day in like two days.
00:34:04 Yes, it is.
00:34:05 I haven't done him.
00:34:06 Wait, really?
00:34:07 Oh, wow.
00:34:08 Yeah, whatever.
00:34:09 Yeah, whatever.
00:34:10 I'll just file for an extension, maybe if I can.
00:34:12 I am when I went to my tax guy, I showed him like everything last last year,
00:34:17 which was my humble linear.
00:34:19 I showed him how much like how much money I didn't make.
00:34:23 And he's all like, wow, so basically just running everything on a loss.
00:34:26 And I'm like, haha.
00:34:27 Didn't.
00:34:28 Yeah.
00:34:29 Didn't you?
00:34:30 Oh, did you not have like taxes withheld from your pay checks or whatever?
00:34:37 No, you don't you don't get a rebate.
00:34:40 Okay.
00:34:41 All right.
00:34:42 I don't either.
00:34:43 Yeah.
00:34:44 So yeah, but he but luckily my tax guys is pretty chill guy.
00:34:50 He his office is covered in like little G.I. Joe figures.
00:34:54 I don't know if I talked about this guy before, but I don't think so.
00:34:58 He's pretty cool.
00:34:59 Yeah.
00:35:00 His office is covered in G.I. Joe figures.
00:35:01 He would makes like little custom ones where he like him and him and me part of the G.I.
00:35:07 Joe figure community.
00:35:08 They just give each other little parts and then glue them together.
00:35:11 The G.I. Joe figure community.
00:35:13 Yep.
00:35:14 They make like the GI bros.
00:35:15 The GI bros.
00:35:16 Yeah.
00:35:18 Little custom figures for characters and whatnot.
00:35:21 He really likes my comic and all the shit that I do.
00:35:25 So he'd be like, yeah, you're running everything at a loss, but you know, that's how that's
00:35:28 how it is when you're working on your dreams.
00:35:30 Like, haha.
00:35:31 Yeah.
00:35:32 Yeah.
00:35:33 I guess.
00:35:34 I guess.
00:35:35 I guess that's how it is, huh?
00:35:37 That's sex.
00:35:39 Yeah.
00:35:40 You just got to pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
00:35:44 I guess.
00:35:45 Yeah.
00:35:46 You have to fling yourself up by your bootstraps.
00:35:48 You got to like, like David and Goliath swing yourself around by your bootstraps.
00:35:52 And then we got to right into the eye of the giant.
00:35:55 You have to fling yourself right into the giant yourself.
00:36:00 You got to escape orbit by your bootstraps.
00:36:04 True.
00:36:05 True that.
00:36:06 You got to have the eye of the tiger.
00:36:08 I am.
00:36:09 Yeah.
00:36:10 But killing tigers is illegal.
00:36:13 Who said that?
00:36:16 Is anyone important?
00:36:18 Did any person, any relevant person say that?
00:36:21 That's what I thought.
00:36:23 Uh-oh.
00:36:25 Um, what are we doing here?
00:36:30 What are we doing?
00:36:31 What are we talking about?
00:36:32 Let's go.
00:36:33 Let's go.
00:36:34 Well, I was talking about comics.
00:36:35 This comic.
00:36:36 This is the last comic I made.
00:36:37 And it pissed off a lot of, there's so many angry Christians at me on TikTok.
00:36:42 Are they really?
00:36:43 Yes.
00:36:44 Some of them are speaking in Polish to me and they're mad.
00:36:49 Who has time for this?
00:36:50 Who has time for this?
00:36:51 I don't know.
00:36:52 This is so silly for a thing to get people really mad.
00:36:55 It is.
00:36:56 Yeah, it's really funny.
00:36:57 And it was kind of a banger because it made me jump up by 100 followers on TikTok when
00:37:03 I did it.
00:37:04 It's pretty good.
00:37:05 Yeah, it's pretty good.
00:37:06 Do you know this meme, Ben?
00:37:11 The Annie Man Studio meme.
00:37:14 It's like, it's an animated something or other.
00:37:18 It's like a...
00:37:19 These guys walk in and it's got a huge butt and they look at it.
00:37:22 But I don't know if that's in context.
00:37:24 There's this South American studio called Annie Man and they do animated gay porn, right?
00:37:31 Yeah.
00:37:32 But they kind of do it in a classic cartoon style for some reason.
00:37:37 Okay.
00:37:38 And their intros are very funny and there's one where there's like a black man with a
00:37:43 huge ass and he's walking down the street and all the other men are all going at him.
00:37:48 And they're following him and they're all bobbing to the head of the beat of the song.
00:37:54 Right?
00:37:55 Okay, sure.
00:37:56 Yeah.
00:37:57 And they eventually get into an elevator with him and they go up to some sort of hotel room
00:38:03 where they all have gay sex with him but they're all still dancing.
00:38:06 Like they're still doing like a little dance while they're having gay sex.
00:38:09 Sure.
00:38:10 Sure, beautiful.
00:38:11 Yeah.
00:38:12 It's a beautiful courtship ritual.
00:38:14 So why do you tell me all this for?
00:38:18 What's the...
00:38:20 What's the...
00:38:21 Oh, it's just the most recent comic.
00:38:24 Okay, so this is that but it's Jesus.
00:38:27 Yeah, it's that by Jesus.
00:38:29 Okay.
00:38:30 The Romans are fine.
00:38:33 You know, it's an outside the box concept and I appreciate it.
00:38:38 Thank you.
00:38:40 It's just like how it was when it happened.
00:38:43 Yeah, it is as it was as the Pope says that one time.
00:38:48 Oh.
00:38:49 It's the original of it.
00:38:50 Forgis on the Jeep?
00:38:52 That's the line from the song that they use in the meme.
00:38:57 There's a song called Ballin' and they use like a sped up version of that song for the
00:39:01 meme and it just kind of works.
00:39:06 Oh, this looks terrible.
00:39:08 Yeah.
00:39:09 Yeah.
00:39:10 Okay.
00:39:11 Yeah, you think it was a good looking gay boy?
00:39:14 I don't know.
00:39:17 This is like the proud thing.
00:39:19 The bad.
00:39:20 The bad.
00:39:21 Bare-chested is like they drew the whole thing.
00:39:23 I love the...
00:39:24 Like each frame and it's all jerky.
00:39:25 I love the scene where like once they get up to the hotel room he like does it like a
00:39:30 funny spin and he takes off all his clothes.
00:39:33 I like all the guys in top hats and the wife and the big floofy just like appalled, like
00:39:39 dropping their monocles.
00:39:40 Like, well, good heavens.
00:39:42 Good heavens.
00:39:43 This man walking down the street with like the biggest, thickest ass ever.
00:39:51 Yeah, so people have been using this as kind of like a meme template.
00:39:55 Gotcha.
00:39:56 This is me putting my hat into the ring.
00:39:59 Gorgas on the jeep.
00:40:02 Putting your crown of thorns into the ring.
00:40:07 Yeah.
00:40:08 Jesus has risen.
00:40:09 He has made me rise.
00:40:10 You know what I'm saying?
00:40:12 Everyone was saying like, oh, this is blasphemy.
00:40:14 You're going to hell.
00:40:15 Someone said like, do you not know what Jesus did for you?
00:40:19 I retweeted a tweet that I thought was really funny on Easter where a guy just says like,
00:40:26 yeah, in the Bible, in the New Testament, there's a part where some of the apostles,
00:40:34 they meet some guy.
00:40:35 The guy's name is Nathaniel and they tell Nathaniel like, hey, the savior is here.
00:40:41 We got him.
00:40:42 And he's a guy from Nazareth.
00:40:45 The guy says like, Nazareth sucks.
00:40:50 No, he's not.
00:40:51 Why would he be from Nazareth?
00:40:52 Nazareth sucks ass.
00:40:53 And they're like, no, no, come on, come on.
00:40:55 And then later when Jesus meets Nathaniel, he says like, this guy knows exactly what's
00:41:00 up.
00:41:01 Like this guy is so on the level.
00:41:02 He's totally right about everything, including my hometown of Nazareth being a shithole.
00:41:09 Pretty good.
00:41:10 Pretty good.
00:41:11 I guess.
00:41:13 I guess like, I guess like he was not prophesized to come.
00:41:17 He was prophesized to come from Bethlehem.
00:41:20 This is a point I was not clear on before.
00:41:22 I guess the prophecy was he would come from Bethlehem and Nazareth is like near ish Bethlehem.
00:41:28 So like, it's as if it's as if it's as if they said, oh yeah, the savior will be born
00:41:35 in Boston, but then he was born in like Lowell instead.
00:41:38 Yeah.
00:41:40 That's how you know.
00:41:41 Close enough, I guess.
00:41:42 That's how you know they're fucking lying to you.
00:41:44 Oh, that's how you would be born in Boston.
00:41:46 Yeah.
00:41:47 Okay.
00:41:48 Whatever you say, buddy.
00:41:49 Right.
00:41:50 Sure.
00:41:51 Right.
00:41:52 I've been kind of in like an anti-Christian mood as of late.
00:41:55 Correct.
00:41:56 But, but cheesy.
00:41:57 What about your soul?
00:41:59 Oops.
00:42:00 Oh, oopsie.
00:42:01 Oh, oh, oh, damn.
00:42:02 Oh, shit.
00:42:03 I didn't even consider it.
00:42:04 Oh, no, no.
00:42:05 Pray.
00:42:06 Pray now.
00:42:07 Pray, pray, pray.
00:42:08 You gotta pray the soul.
00:42:09 Oh, father out in heaven.
00:42:10 Please don't put me in hell.
00:42:12 Please, please, pretty please don't put me in hell.
00:42:15 No.
00:42:16 But what I mean is I've been in my private server.
00:42:21 I'm doing an art challenge where you're supposed to take like a superhero.
00:42:25 You do like the evil version of them.
00:42:28 And you kind of go in whatever direction you want with it.
00:42:31 So I was thinking like, okay, what if I did the fantastic four, but they're like religious
00:42:36 zealots, you know, instead of like scientists and like having a pro profit organization,
00:42:42 they're just like, that sounds like something that laserbot would make.
00:42:46 Yeah.
00:42:47 And they're, and they're called the fateful four is like their name now.
00:42:50 And I drew like the majority of them already.
00:42:52 Here's, here's my Mr. Fantastic.
00:42:54 I call them father flesh.
00:42:56 Like a melty gross.
00:42:58 Yeah.
00:42:59 All of them are disgusting.
00:43:00 All of them are kind of like body horror themes.
00:43:02 Here's the, he's like evil invisible woman right here.
00:43:07 Call her a mother transparency.
00:43:10 Yep.
00:43:11 Mother transparency.
00:43:12 That's cute.
00:43:13 I reminds me of that one Pokemon.
00:43:16 The ultra beast one.
00:43:19 Yes.
00:43:20 The rock, the rock poison one.
00:43:22 Nile ego.
00:43:23 Yeah.
00:43:24 I think I am going to like do like if I were to draw more of this interpretation of the
00:43:29 character, because she has like four shield power, you could do like kind of like four
00:43:33 shield kind of like tentacle shit.
00:43:35 So it looks more like a jellyfish.
00:43:37 Yeah.
00:43:38 Yeah.
00:43:39 And I was cool.
00:43:40 This is cool.
00:43:41 I got a, this is the evil human tour.
00:43:42 She called this one the human pyre.
00:43:45 Oh, these are cool.
00:43:47 These are pretty good.
00:43:48 And I'm pretty good.
00:43:49 Currently working on the evil thing, but I'm not too married to this design.
00:43:54 I might change this around.
00:43:57 He's like, um,
00:43:58 Yeah, it's hard because like, how do you turn a thing, a monstrous rock thing into invert it?
00:44:04 Yeah.
00:44:05 Wait, I've got it.
00:44:06 I've got it.
00:44:07 I've got it.
00:44:08 He's not made of rocks.
00:44:10 No, no, no, no, no.
00:44:12 Wait, he's made of rock.
00:44:15 The dome of the rock.
00:44:17 The Islamic shrine in Jerusalem.
00:44:21 Oh my God.
00:44:23 What does that look like?
00:44:24 Hold up.
00:44:26 It just kind of looks like a domed mosque.
00:44:29 Is that the Minecraft cube?
00:44:32 Oh.
00:44:33 Oh, it is.
00:44:34 It's the Minecraft cube.
00:44:35 It's the golden dome.
00:44:37 It's the golden Jewish dome.
00:44:39 Oh, the other thing.
00:44:41 Well, these guys are supposed to be like.
00:44:43 Well, it's Islamic.
00:44:44 These guys are supposed to be like Christian-esque, right?
00:44:47 Yeah.
00:44:48 Okay.
00:44:49 Yeah.
00:44:50 All right.
00:44:51 I'm going off theme.
00:44:52 When I drew the Jesus with the big ass,
00:44:54 someone's like, okay, now do Mohammed.
00:44:56 And I'm like, I have no idea what the fuck Mohammed does.
00:44:58 And I wouldn't.
00:45:00 Because.
00:45:01 He moved a mountain.
00:45:02 Didn't he?
00:45:03 Did he?
00:45:04 People like to.
00:45:05 Or maybe.
00:45:06 People like to do the whole.
00:45:07 He like had like a child bride.
00:45:10 Yeah.
00:45:11 I mean, I definitely.
00:45:12 Yeah.
00:45:13 Definitely heard about that one.
00:45:14 That was his greatest miracle.
00:45:15 What do you want me to do about that?
00:45:17 That happened like millions of years ago.
00:45:19 Draw his child's bride admiring his gigantic ass.
00:45:23 Draw his legally aged child bride.
00:45:27 Oh, the.
00:45:28 The.
00:45:29 Yes.
00:45:30 The cube.
00:45:31 The cube.
00:45:32 I forget what the cube is called.
00:45:33 The cube is great.
00:45:34 I love that.
00:45:35 I love that they have a cube, you know.
00:45:37 Yeah.
00:45:38 Yeah.
00:45:39 It's good.
00:45:40 And you have to like point in that direction.
00:45:41 It's crazy.
00:45:42 Oh no.
00:45:43 Enderman.
00:45:44 No.
00:45:45 Someone should do.
00:45:46 You can't steal it.
00:45:47 You have to do a transformer movie where the cube is a transformer.
00:45:50 Like it's.
00:45:51 It's like another all spark.
00:45:53 Like we found it.
00:45:54 Yeah.
00:45:55 And they use it to power their ship.
00:45:59 We found.
00:46:00 It's just a cool looking.
00:46:01 It's just a cool looking item.
00:46:03 It's a cool.
00:46:04 Exactly.
00:46:05 And it's like what's great about it is that there isn't like a bleeding guy on it.
00:46:09 You know.
00:46:10 That's what.
00:46:11 Yeah.
00:46:12 True.
00:46:13 Yeah.
00:46:14 True.
00:46:15 That would suck.
00:46:16 He was bleeding.
00:46:17 Oh, he died.
00:46:18 He was bleeding.
00:46:19 Oh, gee whiz.
00:46:20 Well, I didn't know.
00:46:21 He's he's a martyr.
00:46:22 He's a martyr.
00:46:23 God, I fucking hate martyrs.
00:46:24 Remember how you remember how they owned our God so hard?
00:46:28 We remember.
00:46:29 He came back though.
00:46:30 He came back.
00:46:31 Oh, Ben did come back.
00:46:32 Ben, do you not know what Jesus did for you?
00:46:35 I do know because I just rewatched that the Jenny Nicholson video about the church plays,
00:46:42 including the one where they crucify Batman on the bat signal.
00:46:45 That's crazy.
00:46:47 That's that's the real shit.
00:46:49 Batman does that in one of the movies, but to a criminal, he puts his body on the giant
00:46:55 like spotlight.
00:46:58 So it's so Batman kind of crucified him.
00:47:01 So Batman's like anti-Christian, if you will.
00:47:04 You know that scene in Digimon where they're crucifying not Gabumon, the wolf one.
00:47:11 Yeah, I thought the wolf one was Gabumon.
00:47:14 Is it Gabumon?
00:47:15 Yeah.
00:47:16 That's not a misremembering.
00:47:19 Garurumon, that's the only one I remember.
00:47:23 It is Gabumon.
00:47:24 Yeah, Gabumon evolves into Garurumon, which evolves into where Garurumon?
00:47:28 Which evolves into metal Garurumon?
00:47:30 And then ultimate Garurumon.
00:47:32 Probably.
00:47:33 And then mega Garurumon or something.
00:47:36 I always remember that they had an ultimate form, but then beyond ultimate is mega, which
00:47:41 doesn't make sense.
00:47:43 Ultimate would imply it's the most.
00:47:45 There he is.
00:47:46 I like how he's kind of holding his own paw.
00:47:49 Is this an Ultraman reference?
00:47:52 He's clearly like he's a dinosaur wearing like a wolf skin.
00:47:58 I like that.
00:47:59 Wow, I've never thought of that before, but that is what it is.
00:48:03 That's definitely what it is.
00:48:05 It's weird compared to like Agumon, who is just a dinosaur.
00:48:10 Gabumon, who is like the two of them are like the two iconic ones from that series.
00:48:17 One of them is just like a way more busy, complicated concept.
00:48:22 Yeah, I completely forgot he had that stomach tattoo.
00:48:26 He's got the second pair of paws from the skin.
00:48:31 And a unicorn horn.
00:48:32 Yeah, the unicorn horn.
00:48:34 Some of these stuff could be removed, you know?
00:48:37 Yeah.
00:48:38 That's probably why they crucified him.
00:48:40 Didn't remember that belly tattoo.
00:48:43 What's going on with that?
00:48:44 What's going on there?
00:48:45 He's like a freak.
00:48:47 He is a freak.
00:48:49 All these 17 different colors on him.
00:48:53 None of this is working for me.
00:48:56 That's why they crucified him.
00:48:58 Nice.
00:48:59 Yeah, we had it coming really.
00:49:01 To take off the wolf skin, never.
00:49:05 I'll die first, and then he did.
00:49:08 For our sins.
00:49:13 Oh, boy.
00:49:15 Yeah.
00:49:16 Oh, wait, here's Naked.
00:49:19 Here's Naked Garumon.
00:49:21 I think I've seen this.
00:49:23 For your pleasure.
00:49:25 Dumpy little guy.
00:49:27 It looks like a chicken nugget.
00:49:31 You know, without the fur, my eyes are drawn even more to his weird belly, and I don't understand.
00:49:39 It's like the only part of his body that has blue on it compared to the rest of his eye.
00:49:44 Right.
00:49:45 Yeah, I don't mind that he has a fur coat over himself.
00:49:49 It looks rad.
00:49:51 It's not a terrible idea in concept, but like...
00:49:55 The unicorn horn is like, I mean, I get it.
00:49:58 It kind of adds a little bit more to the silhouette.
00:50:00 Imagine trying to draw him.
00:50:02 Imagine being a kid and trying to draw Garumon.
00:50:04 Oh, I don't need to imagine.
00:50:06 I would never try to draw this guy, because he was like the worst.
00:50:09 I like drawing the...
00:50:12 I mean, honestly, this guy is...
00:50:14 The one that turns into the, oh, what's it, Palmon.
00:50:16 Palmon turns into the giant, like, Final Fantasy.
00:50:18 Patamon.
00:50:19 Patamon.
00:50:20 Yeah.
00:50:21 No.
00:50:22 I thought it was Palmon.
00:50:23 Wait, which one's Palmon?
00:50:26 Yeah, the...
00:50:29 It's not Palmon.
00:50:30 It's the one Palmon turns into.
00:50:31 Oh, the one that turns into Farimon, or Lilliman.
00:50:35 This fucking...
00:50:37 It's the Final Fantasy guy.
00:50:39 The Final Fantasy cactus.
00:50:41 Yes.
00:50:42 Okay, I did like...
00:50:43 I thought you meant Patamon who becomes Anjuman.
00:50:46 That was my favorite.
00:50:48 I did like Patamon.
00:50:49 I like Lilliman.
00:50:50 I liked...
00:50:51 I liked Anjuman because it reminded me of Yu-Gi-Oh.
00:50:54 That was a Yu-Gi-Oh card.
00:50:55 I liked...
00:50:57 I liked...
00:50:59 I don't even remember their names, but...
00:51:02 Joey's the one that turns...
00:51:04 The ultimate form of Joey's one,
00:51:06 that is, like, the big walrus with, like, the turtle shell
00:51:09 and the giant...
00:51:10 Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
00:51:11 That one was pretty cool.
00:51:12 I liked Garudaman, the...
00:51:14 What was the bug's one?
00:51:16 Kabuteremon?
00:51:18 Ultracabu...
00:51:20 I think it was Kabuteremon was the bug.
00:51:24 Tentamon.
00:51:25 Yes.
00:51:26 This was my favorite design, actually, I remember.
00:51:29 Because it was like...
00:51:30 It was basically aliens, but for kids.
00:51:32 Oh, because it was so fucking fucked up.
00:51:36 Oh, okay.
00:51:37 I wanted an action figure this time.
00:51:38 You meant the Xenomorph.
00:51:39 I thought it was alien for kids,
00:51:41 and I was like,
00:51:42 what's so, like, arerated about aliens?
00:51:44 Oh, no, yeah.
00:51:45 Xenomorph for kids.
00:51:46 Yeah.
00:51:47 That was a really cool design.
00:51:49 Man.
00:51:50 I was talking to people about, like,
00:51:52 why Digimon never caught on in the West
00:51:55 as much as, like, Pokemon did.
00:51:57 And I think Pokemon did a lot of pretty genius things
00:52:02 without simple things, you know?
00:52:05 Like, with Digimon, it's kind of like,
00:52:08 we just really have one,
00:52:10 and you just kind of go back and forth
00:52:12 between the stages of it, right?
00:52:14 But with, like, Pokemon, you get, like, a team, you know?
00:52:17 And, like, the world...
00:52:19 You can catch them all.
00:52:20 Yeah, and the world kind of makes, like,
00:52:22 even though they're both fantasy worlds,
00:52:24 the world kind of makes a little bit more sense
00:52:26 in Pokemon, where it's like, oh, the Pokemon
00:52:28 are just, like, they're animals, you know?
00:52:30 Like, their world has animals.
00:52:32 These are the animals of this world,
00:52:34 and you can, like, just catch them.
00:52:35 Digimon is basically an isekai,
00:52:37 whereas Pokemon is, like,
00:52:40 there's just...
00:52:41 There's no isekai element to it.
00:52:43 It just takes place in a world
00:52:45 that is fully, fully fixated on this, like,
00:52:48 fantasy creature concept
00:52:50 that your life in this setting
00:52:53 is devoted to the mastery of.
00:52:56 I also think the Pokeball
00:52:58 as, like, a symbol, as, like,
00:53:00 the visual symbol of the world is such...
00:53:02 It's so, like...
00:53:04 The fact that it's so simple,
00:53:06 it's, like, so fucking perfect,
00:53:08 and they never change it at all.
00:53:09 I mean, there's different versions of Pokeballs, but...
00:53:11 Yeah.
00:53:12 And another...
00:53:13 Literally iconic.
00:53:14 Another thing is that, like, the way you fight,
00:53:16 the way you capture the Pokemons
00:53:18 is the same way you fight them.
00:53:19 So really, there isn't, like, too much of a disconnect.
00:53:21 Well, like...
00:53:23 I mean, I don't know.
00:53:24 Do you capture more than...
00:53:25 The wristwatches...
00:53:26 And Digimon? I don't know how exactly it works.
00:53:28 No, you just get one.
00:53:30 You just get one.
00:53:31 The Digimon Digi bit,
00:53:33 but, uh, like, wristwatches.
00:53:35 They looked like Tamagotchi's.
00:53:37 I think also didn't...
00:53:38 Which didn't age very well.
00:53:39 Even...
00:53:40 That's an idea.
00:53:41 Even though technically Pokemon only started letting you
00:53:43 customize, like, your character
00:53:45 in the past couple of games,
00:53:48 you could already technically customize.
00:53:50 You remember from the start,
00:53:51 the fact that you choose what Pokemon are in your team
00:53:53 is a form of customization, you know?
00:53:55 Yeah.
00:53:56 Because, uh, like, when I was a kid,
00:53:58 I didn't give a shit about stats.
00:54:00 I only, like, got Pokemon that I thought looked cool.
00:54:02 Right?
00:54:03 And that's kind of...
00:54:04 That's another great thing is that
00:54:05 you could still beat the game with just Pokemon
00:54:07 you think that looked cool.
00:54:08 You could beat the games with complete trashmon.
00:54:10 Right, exactly.
00:54:11 And I think, um, yeah, I think it works.
00:54:13 I think Pokemon did a lot of very genius moves
00:54:16 that, like, made sure it kind of stayed.
00:54:19 And I think, um, I think that's why a lot of these other,
00:54:21 like, Pokemon wannabes keep fumbling.
00:54:23 They don't, like, really sit down
00:54:25 and look at what worked for Pokemon.
00:54:28 Remember when Myotismon...
00:54:32 did evolve at...
00:54:34 Mytosismon?
00:54:35 At 666.
00:54:36 And he attacked fricking Neo-Tokyo or whatever.
00:54:39 And they had the number of the beast.
00:54:40 They had the number of the beast.
00:54:42 On American TV for kids.
00:54:44 Beast.
00:54:45 Beast Japan.
00:54:46 Number of the beast.
00:54:47 Number of the beast.
00:54:48 Number of the beast, more like.
00:54:49 That's right.
00:54:50 The number of the beast.
00:54:51 The beast beast.
00:54:52 It roams our land.
00:54:54 Uh, uh, uh...
00:54:58 I really liked the end of the first Digimon season
00:55:02 really, like, left an impression on me as a kid.
00:55:05 Yeah.
00:55:06 That's shit.
00:55:07 It's pretty wild.
00:55:08 I don't know, it's pretty wild how, like,
00:55:09 they go to this fantasy digital world
00:55:11 and then they come back and, like,
00:55:12 the worst and most, like, deadly demons
00:55:14 follow them back from it and, like,
00:55:16 do terrorism and destroy the real world.
00:55:19 And then, I don't know, something about...
00:55:21 They go to, like...
00:55:22 They have to go to, like, the void
00:55:24 where, like, all the lost, like, data is
00:55:26 and they fight, like, the manifestation of all the,
00:55:28 all the, like, lost and destroyed Digimon data
00:55:32 in that big, like, polyhedron.
00:55:35 Fucking awesome.
00:55:37 So fucking epic and based and radical and cool.
00:55:41 Yeah, I don't...
00:55:42 I think I watched that when I was young
00:55:44 and I haven't re-watched it since.
00:55:46 It would probably be dumb.
00:55:47 It was very confusing.
00:55:48 As a kid, I was like, I can't believe,
00:55:50 I can't believe the stakes.
00:55:51 The stakes have literally never been higher
00:55:52 in my entire life.
00:55:54 But that's the sort of thing, like,
00:55:55 I think Pokemon the show was so good
00:55:59 and so watchable because, um,
00:56:03 every episode was the same thing.
00:56:05 You go to a place, you see a Pokemon,
00:56:07 you're like, whoa, what's going on?
00:56:08 And then you fight.
00:56:09 Yeah.
00:56:10 And in Digimon, there was a narrative
00:56:11 that you had to follow.
00:56:12 And I didn't catch every episode,
00:56:14 so I would just not continue watching Digimon
00:56:16 because I was like, oh, I missed an episode.
00:56:18 I don't know what's going on.
00:56:19 Pokemon doesn't matter.
00:56:20 Yeah.
00:56:21 And so I would watch that instead.
00:56:23 One thing that I really like about Digimon
00:56:25 is I don't know if this was done on purpose,
00:56:27 but the fact that the way, like, the creatures,
00:56:29 like, did evolve, they start out as, like,
00:56:33 something that a little kid would draw.
00:56:35 And as, like, it grows, it kind of becomes more like,
00:56:38 oh, like, you as an artist kind of grow
00:56:40 and you can draw things that are a little bit more complicated,
00:56:42 you know, until you're drawing, like,
00:56:44 your horny OCs, you know,
00:56:47 as you become older.
00:56:48 Right, when they become Angi-Waman
00:56:50 and Lilymon and stuff, yes, yes.
00:56:52 The final stage of evolution.
00:56:54 I kind of dig that.
00:56:56 I really think that's really, like, kind of cool.
00:56:58 You know, it's kind of like, oh, it's, like, growing up.
00:57:00 You know, I mean, because Pokemon do that, too,
00:57:02 but, like, with Digimon, it's kind of, like, more,
00:57:05 really not exactly sure what the next one is going to look like,
00:57:08 you know?
00:57:10 Where are you on the Artispectrum of Digimon Evolutions?
00:57:14 Or Digivolutions?
00:57:16 I don't know.
00:57:17 What's the one before, Rookie?
00:57:21 Is it, like, Baby?
00:57:22 Baby.
00:57:23 Baby.
00:57:24 Goo.
00:57:25 Goo.
00:57:26 Baby.
00:57:27 Zygote.
00:57:28 When you guys were growing up, were you,
00:57:30 you know, like, the concept of, like,
00:57:32 horse girls or wolf girls and shit like that?
00:57:35 Yeah.
00:57:36 Were you, did you specialize in a kind of thing
00:57:39 when you were a kid in that way?
00:57:41 Because when I was-
00:57:42 Egg.
00:57:43 I'm egg.
00:57:44 I'm egg stage.
00:57:45 Oh, you're trans.
00:57:46 Oh, you're going to be trans.
00:57:47 Right.
00:57:48 But basically, what I mean is, when I was very little,
00:57:50 I was like, oh, I really like dinosaurs.
00:57:52 I would re-watch the original Walking with Dinosaurs documentary
00:57:57 that they made.
00:57:58 Because I thought dinosaurs were really cool.
00:58:00 And then I became a dragon kid because I was like,
00:58:02 oh, they're like dinosaurs with superpowers.
00:58:04 But, um, for some, even, but even as a kid,
00:58:07 I realized that I needed, I needed structure.
00:58:09 And there was a structure that drag,
00:58:11 dragons kind of lack structure.
00:58:13 And what I mean is that anything could kind of be a dragon,
00:58:16 you know, or like the, the kind of like the,
00:58:19 the rules of engagement with dragons like vary.
00:58:22 And like, I guess that wasn't enough for me to,
00:58:25 like, latch onto.
00:58:26 And then I found out about Godzilla.
00:58:28 And Godzilla had a lot of structure.
00:58:30 There's a lot of consistency between like,
00:58:32 like Kaiju's and the movies that they come from.
00:58:35 And I really like got into that.
00:58:37 So if I, if it was like a Digivolve evolution tree,
00:58:40 it would have been like,
00:58:41 dinosaur dragon and then like Kaiju kid, you know.
00:58:45 Oh yeah, I see.
00:58:46 Yeah, yeah.
00:58:47 So you guys ever,
00:58:48 did you guys go for something like that?
00:58:50 Is what I'm basically asking?
00:58:51 I, I mean, I remember in class,
00:58:55 there was the one girl who could draw the horses.
00:58:57 And she was the horse girl.
00:58:59 She would always draw horses and she was really good at it.
00:59:02 And I was like, that's so boring.
00:59:04 Where's the night on the horse?
00:59:06 I was always into drawing suits of armor,
00:59:09 swords and knights.
00:59:10 And that is my, I think that's my first thing
00:59:15 because night suits of armor like made up a little shapes.
00:59:18 It's like drawing a person, but it's easy.
00:59:20 Where did you, where do you think you went from there?
00:59:24 Are you still a knight kid?
00:59:27 I don't actually draw suits of armor that much anymore.
00:59:30 I mean, I occasionally, I'm trying to think cause like,
00:59:35 I think I sort of, I liked knights.
00:59:40 And then I got really into Dragon Ball.
00:59:42 And so I started to try and draw manga and I have like an old,
00:59:45 like a ripoff manga of like combining Dragon Ball
00:59:50 and Princess Mononoke.
00:59:52 And Jack and Dexter and stuff.
00:59:55 And I was like, oh, this is so fucking epic.
00:59:58 And it's like Naruto.
00:59:59 It's like got like ninja stuff.
01:00:01 But I don't know if that's like a style or like a type of thing.
01:00:04 I guess I just got into anime.
01:00:06 I was just, I went from knights to anime.
01:00:09 Yeah.
01:00:10 And then I would draw like bleach stuff.
01:00:12 And I don't know what, it's hard to remember.
01:00:16 I drew so many things.
01:00:17 I would draw a lot of like stuff like,
01:00:20 oh, I would copy things that were cool.
01:00:23 Like I would try and draw Goku.
01:00:25 It's something to think about.
01:00:27 Kind of like, what were the things that you like fixated on
01:00:30 when you were a kid, you know?
01:00:33 Ben, were you a kid?
01:00:35 Were you ever a kid, Ben?
01:00:37 No.
01:00:38 Thanks for asking.
01:00:40 Ben was pulled out of the mud.
01:00:44 It works.
01:00:46 He was pulled out of the slime.
01:00:48 Yes.
01:00:49 Yes.
01:00:50 Yes.
01:00:51 He was pulled out of his slime.
01:00:52 He formed and ready to draw the vapors.
01:00:55 By his father, Father Sate pulled him out of the slime.
01:00:58 And then he pulled Nate out of the gold.
01:01:02 The gold.
01:01:05 I am.
01:01:06 Because he's a golden boy.
01:01:07 He's made of molten AU.
01:01:10 I don't know.
01:01:11 I liked Animorphs.
01:01:12 I like to draw Animorphs aliens.
01:01:16 That's it.
01:01:17 I'll just put you down.
01:01:19 You're a slime kid now.
01:01:22 That's when I was like little.
01:01:25 At some point, I used to be into like space.
01:01:28 I was into like space and planets as a little kid.
01:01:30 And then I got into Animorphs.
01:01:31 And then at some point, I read like Lord of the Rings.
01:01:36 And then after that, I was into fantasy instead of science fiction.
01:01:40 So I was into the wheel of time.
01:01:43 And then, I don't know.
01:01:47 Definitely drew a lot of Lord of the Rings.
01:01:51 Then I found out about sex and I became a sex kid.
01:01:54 Yeah.
01:01:55 Then I became a Chad.
01:01:56 Then I put aside childish things and I put away books for babies.
01:01:59 And I just fucked bitches instead.
01:02:01 Nice.
01:02:02 Hell yeah.
01:02:04 And then I picked up, you know, I diversified my portfolio.
01:02:10 And picked up the sword.
01:02:12 I started training in the blade.
01:02:14 I, you know, I made a bunch of investments.
01:02:17 My, you know, I invested Wall Street, got Bitcoin.
01:02:21 Obviously, I got Bitcoin back in like 2001.
01:02:24 So now I'm billionaire.
01:02:27 And that's it.
01:02:28 That's the story.
01:02:29 Wow.
01:02:30 It sounds like you make nothing.
01:02:31 I can't believe there's a billionaire on this show.
01:02:33 And we never knew.
01:02:34 Yeah.
01:02:35 It's pretty ironic.
01:02:36 It sounds like you only make good choices, Ben.
01:02:38 That's crazy.
01:02:39 It is crazy.
01:02:41 It is crazy.
01:02:42 It is crazy.
01:02:43 Thanks for noticing.
01:02:44 That's insane.
01:02:45 I, for what, am appalled to hear that.
01:02:51 I know it's fucked up.
01:02:52 It's fucked up.
01:02:53 You can make all the right choices and still end up like me.
01:02:56 I know it's really discouraging.
01:02:58 It's discouraging me if I'm making the right choices.
01:03:01 Maybe I should make wrong choices instead.
01:03:04 Maybe.
01:03:05 I'm really, I'm really like looking like my eyeballs have turned inwards and they're
01:03:09 looking at my brain scanning for like what I was into and what I was drawing.
01:03:13 There's loads of things.
01:03:15 I think, I can't like remember though, like in what order anything came.
01:03:20 And you are like Fire Emblem.
01:03:22 I would draw a lot of knights and swords.
01:03:24 I would try drawing skeletons a lot.
01:03:27 But skeletons are difficult.
01:03:29 You never have like memories of an adult talking about you as a kid saying like, oh yeah,
01:03:34 so and so is really into this and that.
01:03:37 Like you wouldn't hear that.
01:03:39 I would hear that.
01:03:40 But what I would hear is like, oh, they're into art.
01:03:46 Damn.
01:03:47 They like drawing.
01:03:48 And so I'm like, yeah, I was the drawing kid.
01:03:51 For birthdays, people would get me colored pencils.
01:03:54 And I'm like, okay.
01:03:55 Nice.
01:03:56 Oh yeah.
01:03:59 Where do you actually use them?
01:04:03 Yeah.
01:04:04 I'm pretty sure I used some of them.
01:04:07 It was just sort of the one thing though.
01:04:09 It's just like more pencils, more paper.
01:04:13 You never have enough.
01:04:14 Never enough pencils.
01:04:15 How to draw manga.
01:04:16 I remember getting that like the iconic Ha Ha La Mal book of how to draw manga with the
01:04:23 terrible fucked up face on the cover.
01:04:25 I had that book.
01:04:26 Based.
01:04:27 And I learned how to draw.
01:04:29 I remember reading and being like, okay, I guess I could learn how to draw this.
01:04:32 But I don't like how it looks.
01:04:33 I didn't have that one, but I had some very similar books.
01:04:38 Google it.
01:04:39 I checked out how to draw manga from the library one time.
01:04:42 I checked out several of them.
01:04:43 I thought it was like a series of them.
01:04:45 I can't believe.
01:04:46 In retrospect it wasn't.
01:04:48 This exists.
01:04:49 Yeah, that one.
01:04:50 That one's great.
01:04:51 That one's a classic.
01:04:52 That's the one you had?
01:04:53 That's the one I had.
01:04:55 Yeah, I did not.
01:04:57 What does Katie Koop draw like now, I wonder?
01:05:01 Oh, let's find out.
01:05:08 I had one that was actually kind of good.
01:05:11 It was this one.
01:05:13 Oh, these are like expensive now.
01:05:16 These are like, yeah, how did this, this how to draw manga is actually kind of cool.
01:05:23 And it's, and it even.
01:05:24 Oh, I remember what reading this in the one of the ones in the series.
01:05:29 It even talks about like, I only read the first volume because I had it, but it talks about
01:05:34 not just like the drawing, but like being a mangaka and like having assistance and like,
01:05:39 you know, be like working for an editor and stuff.
01:05:45 And then I had another one that I am not seeing in any of these search results.
01:05:53 But the other one that I had was pretty crappy and it was very much, it just gave you like
01:05:58 a bunch of stock characters and was like, draw a circle, draw another circle,
01:06:02 put big hair on the circle, put the eye like this.
01:06:09 That one sucked.
01:06:11 Oh, wow.
01:06:12 Oh my god.
01:06:13 The how to draw manga book, Katie Koop made that when she was 16.
01:06:19 That kind of makes sense.
01:06:20 All right.
01:06:21 Good, good for her.
01:06:22 Look at the art style.
01:06:23 This is obviously a 16 year old.
01:06:25 They, they have drawn, they've drawn it again.
01:06:28 They have a Twitter.
01:06:29 Oh, damn.
01:06:30 Time to follow the queen.
01:06:34 Nice.
01:06:35 It's not, it's still not, it's still not great.
01:06:39 Wow.
01:06:40 When was this from?
01:06:41 It's not great.
01:06:42 It's not great.
01:06:43 Mostly post pictures.
01:06:44 2021.
01:06:45 What a freaking, fucking royalty.
01:06:47 This is fucking, you're not only royalty, we're looking at it right now.
01:06:52 Wait, where?
01:06:53 Oh, well, this is interesting.
01:06:54 She, she wrote about how she was initially happy to work on the book because she was
01:06:58 just a teenager.
01:06:59 She revealed that the character on the cover was a flipped illustration that she never
01:07:03 intended to become the cover art, which she protested at the time.
01:07:08 Okay.
01:07:09 I mean, cool.
01:07:11 Exonerated, I guess.
01:07:13 Not, not, not really.
01:07:15 I mean, I mean, I'm not going to think less of her.
01:07:19 I mean, she was like 16.
01:07:22 You're 16 and the company says, oh, you, you draw that, um, anime or man gay style.
01:07:29 We need to sell a book about that.
01:07:31 So could you, could you do this?
01:07:33 It's like, oh my God.
01:07:35 She's only got the, she only got the, she only got 6,000 followers on Twitter.
01:07:40 Yeah.
01:07:41 Unless I'm looking at the wrong person.
01:07:43 They're, they're KT Coop, right?
01:07:45 Like they go over there.
01:07:46 Yeah.
01:07:47 Yeah.
01:07:48 I found that Twitter from the article that's talking about the artist and this redrawing.
01:07:55 I do album art, promotional materials, web design, illustration.
01:08:01 I'm not super impressed.
01:08:05 Oh, bentate.
01:08:06 I mean, some of this is okay.
01:08:08 Color me surprised.
01:08:09 Some of this is okay.
01:08:10 Like design wise and like the, the actual, the actual, like, oh, like the actual illustration
01:08:17 on display is, is look at these faces.
01:08:20 Look at, look at this face of the guy in the middle here.
01:08:25 Uh, the guy, not the guy in the bottom left, but the, the samurai and armor right above him.
01:08:31 Yeah.
01:08:32 She probably could add a little bit more wrinkles to his face.
01:08:35 It's not, it's not, it's not working.
01:08:37 It's not working.
01:08:38 A little bit more stronger emotion, you know.
01:08:41 Oh man.
01:08:42 Um, I have a, I did it.
01:08:46 I didn't tell you guys about kind of a little feud that I was in the middle of a little
01:08:53 conflict that was happening that I was going back and forth and none of it was like public.
01:08:57 It was all behind like DM that like private discord servers.
01:09:04 That sounds amazing.
01:09:06 That sounds spectacular.
01:09:08 Yeah.
01:09:09 Yeah.
01:09:10 Yeah.
01:09:11 Basically, um, yeah.
01:09:12 And Nellie is our, you could like bleep out this, uh, this group's name.
01:09:16 Um, because I don't want to get into too much fucking trouble about it, but, um, there's
01:09:21 a, there's a, there's an organization called the right.
01:09:25 Okay.
01:09:26 And basically they're, um, they're trying to help out like in the artists and they want
01:09:31 to do their, they're mostly like, you know, helping you try to promote your stuff, yada,
01:09:35 yada, but also, um, they want to make a database like a giant database.
01:09:39 Like a giant database of everyone's like comics, like the, as many indie comics as they can.
01:09:44 Right.
01:09:45 And, um, and I, and I joined and I even like, um, paid kind of like, there was like a membership
01:09:52 fee.
01:09:53 I didn't even pay that.
01:09:54 It was only like five bucks really.
01:09:56 Um, but basically, yeah.
01:09:58 So I joined and I just been in their server and, and I even submitted McPuglachy into
01:10:05 their database.
01:10:06 Right.
01:10:07 Um, wait, wait, I'm sorry.
01:10:09 It's something really funny.
01:10:10 There's an opportunity for BIPOC creators only for a zine called the brown recluse zine
01:10:16 distro.
01:10:17 Like, like the zine is for brown recluse.
01:10:20 It's a brown recluse.
01:10:24 I think it's funny on purpose.
01:10:26 I think it's funny on purpose.
01:10:28 It probably is.
01:10:29 I'm always on the fence about kind of like, oh, we're looking for specific POC creators.
01:10:34 And I'm like, oh, I'm specific.
01:10:35 Yeah.
01:10:36 See creators.
01:10:37 And like, yeah, we want you to do a so and so specific thing that I'm not interested in.
01:10:41 And I'm like, damn, I'm, I'm the wrong kind of POC for this because I'm more interested
01:10:45 in drawing goblins than like other like, melanated people, you know, I'm kind of like, I'm kind
01:10:52 of like, you know, he's much more interested in telling movies about goblins than movies
01:10:56 about Mexicans.
01:10:58 Definitely.
01:10:59 True.
01:11:00 Basically.
01:11:01 Okay.
01:11:02 So anyway, I submitted a McPuglachie into their database, right?
01:11:06 And then I got a rejection letter, which I thought was weird because and they told me
01:11:12 that the quality was not up to par for the database.
01:11:16 Now, yeah, here's the weird thing.
01:11:18 If you take a quick glance through their database, you get the impression that quality is on a
01:11:25 spectrum.
01:11:26 Right.
01:11:27 I got the big impression that quality is has varies a lot.
01:11:33 Where, where would I find their data?
01:11:35 Right, right here.
01:11:36 It's on the website.
01:11:37 But here's the direct link.
01:11:38 So yeah, I, if you just go through and I read a handful of these of these, if you scroll
01:11:42 through it, um, yeah, it's obvious that quality is on a spectrum here, you know, I was so surprised
01:11:48 to find out that make Puglachie got rejected, you know.
01:11:53 And I, yes, I mean, the not all, not all of these look like super professional.
01:12:00 Right.
01:12:01 And yeah, I didn't even got, I never got the impression that it was supposed to be like
01:12:06 professional at all or anything because it's indie comics, you know, right?
01:12:11 And yeah.
01:12:12 Oh, but basically here's here's a Google Drive link to it.
01:12:15 This is, I'm, I'm like, wait, you know, I don't want to be mean.
01:12:19 Okay.
01:12:20 Don't call, don't call anyone out or anything.
01:12:22 But I mean, I mean, come on.
01:12:27 Yeah, that's, see, that's the thing.
01:12:29 I didn't call out no one, but I kept saying like, look, like it seems like quality is
01:12:33 not on a spectrum.
01:12:34 It's, you know, like what's, what's the deal?
01:12:37 Right.
01:12:38 So I'm thinking like, um, oh, by the way, above, I'm just gonna get again, but here's
01:12:42 a, here's a Google Drive link to, to an image gallery of all the screenshots of me going back
01:12:47 and forth with them.
01:12:48 And it starts with a, it starts with my rejection.
01:12:50 God, I'm not, I'm not reading these.
01:12:52 Well, I'm just going to summarize it.
01:12:53 So it starts with their rejection letter and me like replying back to them saying like,
01:12:58 I think I, I think I disagree with what you said.
01:13:01 Also, another thing that they said in the rejection later, they kind of like pissed me
01:13:04 off a little bit, but they said, um, they said, we encourage you to resubmit after you developed
01:13:10 your craft more.
01:13:12 And I thought that was kind of a rude thing to say.
01:13:16 Um, I did talk to my like, I mean, yeah, I mean, look, look at what's in the database.
01:13:22 Yeah, like, I'm sorry, but there's straight, there's straight up amateur stuff.
01:13:25 And also, and here's another thing that also pissed me off.
01:13:27 If you go into their cartoonist cooperative Instagram, um, you will find that one of
01:13:32 their Instagram posts is a promotion for Mick Pagliacci, like it's up there.
01:13:36 Right.
01:13:37 And it's so weird that like, why would you promote it but not having your database?
01:13:41 You know, like it seems kind of a little two-faced a little bit, you know, it seems kind of
01:13:45 hypocritical because what if someone sees that anything?
01:13:48 Well, I don't know.
01:13:49 I mean, is it, is it hypocritical?
01:13:52 Like, is there a reason for this?
01:13:54 Do you want?
01:13:55 I don't understand.
01:13:56 What do you mean?
01:13:57 I mean, like, why did they do this?
01:13:59 Oh, well, I mean, that's what I wanted to know.
01:14:01 Like, why did they reject it?
01:14:02 Right.
01:14:03 Right.
01:14:04 Why would they promote it if they were going to reject it from the database?
01:14:07 Right.
01:14:08 Exactly.
01:14:09 So I asked them, like, what, like, is there, is there something specific about Mick Pagliacci?
01:14:13 Now, in the back of my mind, if you just go for their database, one thing I noticed is
01:14:17 that there's no parodies or anything with like copyrighted characters.
01:14:21 So I'm thinking like, oh, maybe.
01:14:23 Okay.
01:14:24 Okay.
01:14:25 Okay.
01:14:26 Could that be it?
01:14:27 Yeah.
01:14:28 Could that be it?
01:14:29 Right.
01:14:30 But I don't want to suggest that just yet because I want them to say it, you know?
01:14:31 I don't want them to be like, oh, yeah, yeah, that was, that's totally it.
01:14:35 Like, I want them to like, you know, tell me why.
01:14:39 Yeah.
01:14:40 So it's just nice to know.
01:14:41 Yeah.
01:14:42 Basically, they just told me the quality just wasn't up to par.
01:14:44 That's it.
01:14:45 That's just it.
01:14:46 And if they said, if I want feedback to go into their discord, into their feedback chat
01:14:52 in their discord server and post Mick Pagliacci there, and I did, I posted it in there and
01:14:56 I said, like, hey, can anyone tell me, like, why this didn't like get in, you know?
01:15:03 And a couple, a couple of people gave me like some feedback, but everything at any time
01:15:09 they would give me like feedback, I would like question it.
01:15:12 Like, um, someone told me there was one person in there, there was this one guy who said
01:15:20 he couldn't give me feedback in the feedback chat because he doesn't like giving feedback
01:15:24 in the feedback check.
01:15:25 He said he'd much rather prefer I talk in the forums, like, like, and I'm like, can you
01:15:30 just, I asked him, can you just DM me the feedback instead?
01:15:34 And he's like, no, no, it's much better if I do it in the forums and I'm like, well,
01:15:38 you know, I kind of wanted feedback in the feedback chat, but I did make a, yeah, I made
01:15:44 a forum post about it.
01:15:45 So I get feedback there.
01:15:46 And that guy did give me feedback, um, and his, and I even screenshot his feedback too.
01:15:52 It's in there later in the gallery when I go over what they say in the forums.
01:15:57 And I feel like he only had one bit of valid criticism, which he mentioned one panel and
01:16:03 he said that composition of this panel could have been better and I'm like, yeah, I agree.
01:16:06 It could have been better.
01:16:07 Um, yeah.
01:16:09 Okay.
01:16:10 Sure.
01:16:11 But, but this was not like a guy in a position.
01:16:14 This is not a guy in charge of anything.
01:16:15 This is just some guy.
01:16:16 Well, it's a, I think he's a committee member.
01:16:19 Some of them are like committee members, right?
01:16:22 So they're, they're guys that are like up there.
01:16:24 Um, but, but here's pure, I'm thinking, but this is what I'm thinking, because I bet
01:16:28 I could probably 100% bet I could find a comic in their database that does not have that
01:16:33 good composition.
01:16:34 Right.
01:16:35 Yeah.
01:16:36 Like that.
01:16:37 I don't think that's a crazy thing to like bet on, right?
01:16:40 So I'm thinking it's bad composition.
01:16:42 Like, is that the red line?
01:16:44 Is that like the, the, like, oh, like this is like, you got to have good composition.
01:16:50 Um, someone did, someone did mention that they thought the idea was that like funny.
01:16:57 Like it, um, I just, it's not a funny like idea.
01:17:00 They didn't laugh at all.
01:17:02 And it's, it was like a poorly executed joke.
01:17:04 And then I replied.
01:17:05 It was a poorly executed joke.
01:17:06 Is that like the line?
01:17:08 Like if you do a joke and it sucks.
01:17:10 Yeah.
01:17:11 I, it's not, it's not like is my work good enough, but like is like, what is the, what
01:17:17 are the rules?
01:17:18 That's the, that's where the, like, if it is like mascot characters or like stuff can't
01:17:26 be used.
01:17:27 Yeah.
01:17:28 Uh, just a heads up.
01:17:29 Be nice.
01:17:30 The, the, yeah.
01:17:31 If it was, if it was because of copyrighted characters, I think that would be perfectly
01:17:35 reasonable.
01:17:36 They, I asked them about parodies and they said parodies are allowed.
01:17:39 They allow parodies.
01:17:40 And I'm like, all right, well, I just, I guess it wasn't funny enough, but look, but, but
01:17:44 check this out.
01:17:45 Look, this comic right here, um, is, is this funny?
01:17:49 This isn't their humor section.
01:17:50 Is this a funny comic?
01:17:52 Well, let me, let me, let me take a look at the, oh God.
01:17:58 Are these like, um, just individual images or are they like, uh, they're like, uh, you
01:18:03 can flip through them when you click on them.
01:18:06 Oh, I have to log in.
01:18:09 I don't know my login.
01:18:12 Wow.
01:18:13 Yeah.
01:18:14 These are, these are like recent.
01:18:15 These are like recent.
01:18:17 Um, now, now is this funny and now, and like, I don't, I get, I don't have anything against
01:18:26 this, but, um, is it supposed to be funny?
01:18:28 It's in the humor section, but, and they said, and they said, it's not funny enough to,
01:18:33 to be in the database, but this is, and I'm like, okay, well, what's going on?
01:18:37 You know?
01:18:38 Okay.
01:18:39 I, I guess, I guess my thoughts on this are, yeah, I, I don't understand the, the standard
01:18:46 of quality.
01:18:47 I don't understand by what standard of quality, something like this is like, it's the thumbs
01:18:52 up, but something like McPagliacci is like, nah, it's not good enough.
01:18:57 I don't know what criteria they could give you that by which it isn't good enough.
01:19:03 But maybe, maybe, maybe more.
01:19:06 So who cares?
01:19:09 Yeah.
01:19:10 Ultimately, who cares about being a stupid database?
01:19:13 Well, the thing is, I would like, I mean, I would want McPagliacci to be as many things
01:19:18 as possible.
01:19:19 And it's kind of like this isn't really like, I don't think it's any, it's no skin off their
01:19:24 back if they post it, if they have it in their database, like it's not going to fucking, what's
01:19:29 the negative effect of it?
01:19:31 It's clearly up to par with like a lot of things they have up there, right?
01:19:35 What do you, what do you get out of them putting it in their database?
01:19:38 When you look up McPagliacci, it pops up if it's on like, it's on like a website, right?
01:19:45 I mean, I guess so.
01:19:46 Yeah.
01:19:47 Like, you know, yeah, it helps a little bit.
01:19:50 Like, you know, when people, now when people look for their database, they're going to
01:19:52 see McPagliacci, you know, it helps, you know, when they look for a database of content.
01:19:56 Doesn't hurt as the main thing.
01:19:58 Yeah, it doesn't hurt.
01:20:00 Here's the thing, the more I talk to them, the more like, the vibe that I get is that
01:20:04 they kind of already didn't like me.
01:20:08 And I think, and I think the reason why is because they didn't like that I kept posting
01:20:11 McPagliacci in the promo chat on their Discord server.
01:20:15 Yeah.
01:20:16 And which is weird, because it's the promo chat, you know, what did you, what else did
01:20:20 you want to post it?
01:20:22 They gave me the vibe that they specifically wanted me to make friends first before I start
01:20:27 asking about promotions.
01:20:29 Like, like, oh, we, yeah, like you're, you're never, you're never, you're always just promoting
01:20:33 yourself.
01:20:34 You're never like having conversations in there.
01:20:36 You're never like making, trying to make friends.
01:20:37 And it's like, well, fuck, well, fuck you because how, how do you not know I'm not making
01:20:42 any friends outside of it?
01:20:43 How do you know I'm not talking to these people in the group outside of the group?
01:20:47 Do I have to like be discussing them in the Discord?
01:20:49 Do I need evidence that I'm becoming friends with people?
01:20:53 That's kind of the feeling that I get in a lot of like comics spaces on the internet.
01:21:00 They're just kind of a big social club and nobody's really there to like, nobody's really
01:21:05 there to like make it in comics.
01:21:08 They're all just there to fuck around.
01:21:09 Hi.
01:21:10 Yeah.
01:21:11 We're trying to create an in-group that we can exclude people from.
01:21:14 Yeah.
01:21:15 We're trying to be like the coolest people ever that we imagine all the, all the comics
01:21:20 that we idolize are in.
01:21:21 I think.
01:21:22 We have our own club because we can't be in there.
01:21:24 I think what I think that's a lot of where it comes from.
01:21:26 I think the plan with this is that and like, yeah, I have no evidence for this plan, but
01:21:30 the idea is that the bigger this group gets, who are people going to most likely be talking
01:21:36 about that are involved in this group?
01:21:37 They're not going to be talking about the individual people in it.
01:21:39 They're going to talk about the people who run it, right?
01:21:41 Yeah.
01:21:42 And if people are running it, I'm going to get way more attention than anybody else like
01:21:47 in the group.
01:21:48 Sure.
01:21:49 Right.
01:21:50 And that's why, that's why you run things.
01:21:51 Yeah.
01:21:52 Like pixel dog comic.
01:21:53 Like the guy who made this is one of the guys who, who started it.
01:21:57 You know?
01:21:58 So it's like.
01:22:00 Well, there you go.
01:22:01 Yeah.
01:22:02 It's just so.
01:22:03 Well, there you go.
01:22:04 Submit red man.
01:22:05 And if they reject it, I can have, I can have like, cancel, red man will cancel.
01:22:10 Please submit red man.
01:22:11 Please submit red man.
01:22:12 Oh man.
01:22:13 If you, if you get it, I'm going to get mad.
01:22:16 No, I'll just do what you did.
01:22:20 I will not make friends and I'll see if they hate me.
01:22:23 No, this is like, well, it's like a science experiment.
01:22:27 No, I think, I think, I think you're right.
01:22:30 I think it's like, they don't know it's that it's a club.
01:22:34 It's a club and you're not in it and they don't know you.
01:22:37 And that's, that's more important.
01:22:39 Yeah.
01:22:40 And I mean, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of a shame, you know, it's kind of a really
01:22:44 big shame because, because like, you know, I saw the word cooperative and I thought, oh,
01:22:49 these guys must be cool.
01:22:50 They're more cooperative in the name and well, I see some people are more cooperative than
01:22:55 others.
01:22:56 Um, but I don't, is it, is it just comics?
01:22:59 Is it?
01:23:00 I feel like comics are always like that.
01:23:02 It's always just people fucking around.
01:23:03 I think it's like any kind of indie scene kind of thing, you know, yeah, which is that
01:23:09 what it's like to join bands, which is a shame.
01:23:12 That's the problem.
01:23:13 Is this what it is?
01:23:14 It's probably like to join a band that is just fucking around.
01:23:17 I remember back in high school, one of my buddies who was like, who would like rap and
01:23:21 whatnot.
01:23:22 Um, he said that there was like kind of like groups of, of like little smaller indie rappers
01:23:27 who, who would think themselves all hard and everything or really they just jerking themselves
01:23:32 off and they're on the club and that just, they just kind of happened in the indie scene.
01:23:36 I am reminded of like, I'm reminded of like, uh, the like the Topastic forums, which would
01:23:45 just be like, like no one who's successful on Topastic was posting on the forums.
01:23:51 It was all like, it was all nobodies to maybe people that had like a little bit of clout,
01:23:57 people that were people that were making like people that maybe had like a couple thousand,
01:24:01 a couple thousand views, people that were maybe making like $95 a month on Patreon or something.
01:24:11 People who are successful are not posting in, they're not, they're not posting in forums
01:24:16 about that, talking to other like comic people about like the craft of comic making.
01:24:22 They're not asking for critique and they're not giving critique.
01:24:27 The kind, the kind of critique you get in circles like that is like, oh, this one panel
01:24:31 has like a, the, the, the composition could have been stronger.
01:24:35 Fuck off.
01:24:36 I would, I would die.
01:24:37 I would say these, um, and this kind of curtain is cooperative, I do notice they give critiques
01:24:42 and whatnot.
01:24:43 There's people like engaging and shit and whatnot and I think, I think it's ultimately
01:24:48 they want to like, I think what they really specifically want in their database is comics
01:24:53 made by them, like made in, within their group so they can show off.
01:24:57 That's, that's why, that's why PixelDog or whatever is there.
01:25:00 That's why you fucking pick.
01:25:01 Yeah.
01:25:02 Exactly.
01:25:03 And it's, um, yeah.
01:25:04 I mean, it's, it's a shame.
01:25:05 You're an, you're an interloper.
01:25:07 Yeah.
01:25:08 You're showing up with work and you're an outsider and you're like, include me.
01:25:11 And they're like, well, we don't want it.
01:25:14 We only like you if you're, if you're, you're our best friend and you haven't shown that
01:25:18 you're our best friend yet.
01:25:19 Oh, come on guys, please.
01:25:21 Be nice to us.
01:25:22 Be my comic in your database.
01:25:23 I'll be your best friend.
01:25:24 You got to be your best friend first and then we'll put you in the database.
01:25:28 My mistake was finishing McPug Lashy before joining if, if I did work in progress in their
01:25:34 Discord server, probably would have been a different story, but it's, it's, it's a,
01:25:38 it's annoying.
01:25:39 You know, I feel like there should be like a database for any comics, but it can't be
01:25:42 run by other any comic people.
01:25:45 It's got to be just run by one guy who doesn't make any comics and won't like, um, doesn't
01:25:50 have any like assumptions about anybody who just put anyone in it, you know.
01:25:54 Yo, Gib, once, once the perfect comic party is out, this is going to be us.
01:26:00 We're going to be the in group and we're going to be the only, and only our best
01:26:04 friends will get to, uh, only the bestest of friends, the bestest, so I'm going to be
01:26:09 like, yeah, I submitted my comic into a, I did perfect comic party, but they said it
01:26:12 wasn't funny enough, but they have a McPug Lashy there.
01:26:15 Uh, no, no, it doesn't make any sense, make it make sense, guys.
01:26:20 Can we, can we, can we put McPug Lashy in the imperfect comic party?
01:26:24 Um, sure.
01:26:25 Well, how does that, how does that work?
01:26:27 How would that work exactly?
01:26:28 Um, McPug Lashy is quite long overall.
01:26:32 How many pages is it?
01:26:33 It's split it into two ads, it's already split into two ads.
01:26:36 Oh yeah, it's, it's got acts.
01:26:37 Yeah.
01:26:38 Oh, fuck it.
01:26:39 Why not?
01:26:39 It'd be like, it'd be like a chapter of so many pages and then the next issue would
01:26:45 have the next chapter.
01:26:46 Not going to, not going to make me sign a contract where you own McPug Lashy now.
01:26:50 No, I, no, I think what you're just.
01:26:52 Will own exclusive rights to print your comic in the perfect comic party.
01:26:56 No, I think, I think it would just be, I think it'll just be like a waiver or like
01:27:01 a form that's just like, you give us permission to post it online.
01:27:07 Like we're, we're, you know, you, you, you formally say like, yes, it's okay for
01:27:13 my work to appear in the digital file and be hosted on this website.
01:27:20 And it's not exclusive and there's no like print rights or anything like that.
01:27:24 No, no, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll take it.
01:27:26 We'll steal it.
01:27:27 We'll, we'll, we'll, I'll ask, I'll come back and beg for
01:27:31 the print rights later.
01:27:33 You know what that reminds me?
01:27:34 I was going to ask, cause I was listening to you guys talking about
01:27:36 perfect comic party like a couple of episodes ago and you mentioned about doing
01:27:41 the whole shunning thing with like the reader voting.
01:27:44 And I thought that was kind of, I don't know if that's, I thought
01:27:49 that was kind of interesting because it's kind of like, okay, but what if like,
01:27:53 let's say for example, what if someone, what if everyone votes?
01:27:56 What if people vote against the comic you're making?
01:28:00 Like, would you stop making Beescapade if everyone was kind of like, no,
01:28:03 I don't like it and they like vote against it?
01:28:08 No, but if, but what if they vote for me though, then that would make me feel good.
01:28:12 Okay, but I'm, I'm saying, okay, let's say it's any, yeah, that may
01:28:15 you feel good, obviously, but just any comic you yourself are personally making.
01:28:19 What if everyone voted against that?
01:28:22 You know, I think, I think that, that, that would be, we would have to ask
01:28:26 the question then, what is the perfect comic party for?
01:28:30 If it's for being a successful comic publishing thing, like a collaboration,
01:28:36 like a bunch of comics in one publication and we want it to be successful
01:28:41 and everybody hates both mine and Ben's comic and we just can't put our own
01:28:44 comics in our own publication anymore, then that we would have to like not
01:28:49 put our comics in there.
01:28:50 But I don't think that's the point for me anyway.
01:28:53 Okay.
01:28:53 I just want to show off my stuff.
01:28:55 You know, I guess I don't really mind if it's not in the perfect comic party,
01:28:58 but like, I guess we'll see.
01:29:00 Okay.
01:29:01 You know what, Cheesy, I do, I do think you have a point.
01:29:03 Like the, the, the reader surveys in Shonen Jump are like, like the
01:29:08 purpose of those is so that like when a comic is bad and performers badly,
01:29:12 they can get rid of it and like, so we don't really need, we don't really
01:29:16 need them for anything.
01:29:18 I guess it's, it's the, it's the thing, but I would like to hear, I would
01:29:21 like to hear reader feedback, but like, I'm, I don't, we're not, until
01:29:25 we're like so inundated with submissions that like, we are too many
01:29:28 quality submissions and we can't host them all until we get to that point.
01:29:32 We don't need to be voting anyone off the island.
01:29:36 So if it comes to a point where like Clarissa Gunsmoke is the least
01:29:40 popular, um, I guess it's no actual like size problem, but it would get bloated
01:29:48 if we just kept saying yes.
01:29:50 And the, the, like the PDF would get like 200 pages long every month.
01:29:54 Um, so yeah, I guess hypothetically I would take my comic off.
01:30:01 I would still put it on my own things, but like, yeah.
01:30:05 I mean, that's, if we want it, if we want it to be like a, just a successful
01:30:10 publishing thing, but I don't see it like a successful or not, not that
01:30:13 it wouldn't be successful, but like the purpose of it is for me to make
01:30:18 comics and have a thing to put it on and be feel cool about it.
01:30:22 I, I think, um, I think, I don't know if I, if in, in this hypothetical
01:30:28 scenario where piece, the per comic party ran for a while and it got really popular
01:30:34 and there were tons of great comics in there and everyone's, we're getting,
01:30:37 we're getting some reader submissions and people are voting and Biscopades is
01:30:40 like bottom of the pile.
01:30:42 It's like the least popular thing in there.
01:30:44 I'll be honest, I wouldn't just quit Biscopades.
01:30:47 I would just, I would just finish, I would just wrap, I would, I would keep
01:30:50 going, finish it, wrap it up.
01:30:51 And then when it was done and be like, oh yeah, well, people didn't like it.
01:30:54 That's, that's what I was thinking.
01:30:55 I would, yeah, I would not, I would not quit Clarissa if people didn't
01:31:00 like it in the perfect comic party.
01:31:01 I would just have it as one of my, on my website, as my little thing
01:31:07 that only a small niche community would enjoy.
01:31:10 Well, because, because I don't see Biscopades being that long, I don't,
01:31:15 I don't think I would even pull it from the perfect comic party.
01:31:18 I'd just be like, eh, fuck it.
01:31:19 You're stuck with it until it's done.
01:31:22 Well, it's going in there.
01:31:23 Well, I think, I think, I think that's a pretty good idea.
01:31:27 If you think of it kind of like when you're selling lemonade and you, you
01:31:31 got your big jar of money and you, you put a couple of your own dollars in there
01:31:34 to make it seem like you're getting business.
01:31:37 I mean, like, if you think of having Biscopades and Clarissa gun smoke as like
01:31:41 your, your starting seeds for, for the publisher, whatever the fuck you guys
01:31:47 calling yourself, I, I, my, my dream, my dream is just that we get enough
01:31:54 submissions every month that we have, you know, it's not just me and Gibbs
01:31:58 comic, there's like a bunch of features in there every month.
01:32:02 There's at least, at least a few.
01:32:05 My dream, my dream is that we do that for a while and then we collect like a
01:32:09 bunch and then we, and then, you know, we approach the artists and we say, hey,
01:32:13 we want to work out a print deal and we compile them into like a volume of like,
01:32:17 I don't know, the 50, the 50 best or something.
01:32:23 And we sell like volume, volume one, the collect, the collected
01:32:27 perfect comic party Kickstarter or something.
01:32:31 But that would be, you know, there's a, we'd have to, we have to make it a
01:32:37 success first before we worry about, worry about that.
01:32:39 Yeah, they're going to have to create some sort of guidelines because with,
01:32:42 um, I mean, with any, with any publisher, they have guidelines of what exactly
01:32:47 they're like looking for, how many pages or whatnot, you know?
01:32:51 Um, I mean, my guidelines, I don't have any, how like hard rules about like page,
01:32:57 page page, page length, I would say probably not more than like 20 ish pages.
01:33:03 And if it's longer than that, we could always just divide it into chapters.
01:33:07 Yeah, I think that's sensible.
01:33:10 I don't actually know how big a normal shonen jump is, because I've never seen one.
01:33:14 They, they have how many different things every week.
01:33:18 I have no idea.
01:33:19 Is it like a huge tone?
01:33:20 Yeah, I think it's like the one piece chapter is like 20 pages by itself.
01:33:25 And then there's like a bunch of other things.
01:33:28 I think it's maybe like, like a hundred or 200 pages is like the weekly.
01:33:33 Dang, the week, every week.
01:33:35 How do you read that?
01:33:36 How do you read all that?
01:33:37 Maybe not.
01:33:38 Well, I mean, it's because they got a whole, they got tons of different
01:33:40 authors in there.
01:33:41 They're all sitting in their shit.
01:33:43 They're on the bullet train sitting down, reading that shit.
01:33:49 Because they're on a first moving vehicle.
01:33:50 They also read.
01:33:51 Well, because on the fast moving vehicle, time dilates.
01:33:55 And so like fewer pages, you can read them and it takes longer to read them.
01:33:59 They have a lot of opportunities to be some, some have a lot of like certain
01:34:04 amount of free time and specific moments to be read, you know.
01:34:09 What was I saying?
01:34:12 Do you do the.
01:34:15 Yeah, I would I would like to print, I would like to print a
01:34:18 collected volume one day.
01:34:19 That's my like, that's how I'll know that the project was like a runaway
01:34:23 a runaway smash hit success.
01:34:26 I was shit.
01:34:26 Maybe I was done.
01:34:27 Maybe I don't have anything else to say.
01:34:28 OK, I got you.
01:34:29 Maybe maybe the surveys.
01:34:31 Maybe the surveys are not super necessary.
01:34:33 I would I will be making a channel in the PCP discord that's specifically
01:34:38 for like perfect comic party, like comic discussion and feedback and stuff.
01:34:42 I would like to accept feedback.
01:34:44 And in fact, Biscopades needs feedback.
01:34:47 Biscopades is going to end with like a like a call to like, hey, send,
01:34:51 send suggestions for the next chapter.
01:34:53 I think I'll take suggestions for like reader, reader commands in like batches.
01:34:59 So like at the end of a chapter, it's like submit as many suggestions
01:35:03 for things to happen in the next one as you want.
01:35:05 And I'll like go through them and I'll just pick ones that I like and I'll
01:35:08 and I'll put them together into the next chapter.
01:35:11 I think that's my plan.
01:35:12 And, you know, I guess we could accept those via email.
01:35:16 We could also just make that like, yes, suggest we got to do the Google forums thing.
01:35:20 Yes, the Google.
01:35:21 Yes, the Google forums thing for feedback.
01:35:23 There's a few little things that I've just been like, I need to focus on
01:35:27 something and the perfect comic party just hasn't been drawing me in.
01:35:33 I don't know.
01:35:34 Do you mean just like a few pages like the putting together the patron thank you page?
01:35:40 Oh, yeah, I just wanted to focus on Clarissa because it was easier to think about.
01:35:43 I think once once the once you finish the thing and we can get together
01:35:48 and be like, yeah, like run through like how it's going to look and all that.
01:35:52 When you say Google forums, you mean like for for like read or for submissions?
01:35:56 Oh, yeah, feedback.
01:35:57 I mean, we could do all sorts of things with Google forums.
01:35:59 I think I think Biscopades like like reader commands.
01:36:03 I think, yeah, Google forums would be a good way to to do those just to have it all in one place.
01:36:10 So I don't have to check my email and check the discord and check Twitter
01:36:13 and check all these things.
01:36:15 You can't have it where like you're posting Biscopades on a website
01:36:19 and then people in the comments are leaving feedback there.
01:36:23 No. So I didn't have a.
01:36:25 I specifically did not want a like comment section.
01:36:29 When I was building my website, my old website,
01:36:32 everyone told me like, you got to have a comment section.
01:36:34 You've got to have a comment and I was like, and I was like, absolutely not.
01:36:39 I do not want a comment section because I'm not popular enough.
01:36:44 Most pages will have no comments and it will just be embarrassing.
01:36:48 So I just don't want it.
01:36:49 Just throw the whole fucking concept out.
01:36:52 I mean, that that's obviously true.
01:36:53 But I was that's even popular comic, even popular comics are like that.
01:36:59 Like most pages just have zero comments.
01:37:01 Yeah, yeah, like people don't think to use that.
01:37:03 But also I don't like the idea of thinking you're reading a comic.
01:37:08 And then, oh, I wonder what people thought about this and scrolling down.
01:37:11 Yeah, I feel like that breaks up the flow of reading the actual thing.
01:37:16 So I don't want any distractions.
01:37:18 My site is you read the comic and then you get out of there.
01:37:21 Yes, reading a comic is not the place for like page by page fucking
01:37:26 peanut gallery commentary.
01:37:29 That's what I don't.
01:37:30 It's another thing I don't like about Topastic and and the line.
01:37:34 Oh, yeah, I should put things on Topastic though.
01:37:38 I maybe I need to advertise through permeants.
01:37:43 I'm a little bit.
01:37:44 I'm a little concerned about line webtoons, like terms of service.
01:37:48 Line webtoons, terms of service seems to kind of imply that like by posting
01:37:53 your stuff online, webtoon, like they are allowed to like print your stuff.
01:37:59 Like it becomes their content, print.
01:38:03 Sorry, that was the impression I got.
01:38:07 Was it is it one of the one of those lines where it's like you like they have
01:38:11 the right to reproduce the work?
01:38:15 Um, because I think that a lot of sites have that where it basically
01:38:19 just means we're allowed to show this on a web page.
01:38:22 We're allowed to host it on a web page that people can see.
01:38:24 You you grant you grant us with respect to user posting.
01:38:28 You grant us a non exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty
01:38:33 fleet free, worldwide, transferable, licensable license to access, use,
01:38:39 host, cash, store, reproduce, transmit, display, publish, and distribute
01:38:45 your user, user posting.
01:38:47 Yeah, I do not like that verbiage at all.
01:38:49 Every, every image hosting site has that.
01:38:51 It basically means, I mean, people freaked out when DeviantArt, when
01:38:55 somebody looked at the DeviantArt terms of service and they had that in there.
01:38:59 DeviantArt's word for other reasons for the AI stuff.
01:39:01 But like that specifically just means that when somebody loads a page,
01:39:06 DeviantArt, you've given DeviantArt the permission to display the
01:39:11 permission to display the image so that it works.
01:39:15 And they have to give it all those words so that it makes sense
01:39:18 because like worldwide means accessing from any place that you can access the
01:39:22 site. I appreciate that.
01:39:23 But like taken, taken literally, it seems like it gives them like if they wanted
01:39:28 to, they could like print your stuff in a book and sell it.
01:39:31 That's what they say print, though.
01:39:33 They say, no, they don't say print.
01:39:36 Because that's the only thing.
01:39:38 It looks like I'm pretty sure.
01:39:42 Reproduce, transmit, display, publish, and distribute.
01:39:45 Reproduce, but like online.
01:39:48 Well, it doesn't, it doesn't.
01:39:49 I know it doesn't specify, but like I don't think anything of that
01:39:53 nature has ever happened.
01:39:54 And like every site has that sort of clause.
01:39:58 I thought that when you were with user hosted, submitted content.
01:40:01 Well, the, well, the Tappas one.
01:40:04 Well, the, the Tappas one specifically said that they won't do the things
01:40:10 that I'm worried about.
01:40:12 So maybe, maybe you're right.
01:40:13 And maybe that's just, they all have it.
01:40:15 And maybe Tappas was just being extracurricular.
01:40:18 I think maybe there was a lot, a lot of picking wire, um, legal,
01:40:22 legal, like explanation about what that more actually means or what that stipulation
01:40:28 something to look into, I guess.
01:40:29 It, I mean, it might be a matter of precedent where like if they ever did try
01:40:34 to like take a bunch of like user submitted stuff and like print it, there
01:40:39 would be a lawsuit and then probably some legal precedent would be established.
01:40:42 It's like, no, you can't do that.
01:40:44 Uh, and it might not be in like the letter of the, the contract or whatever.
01:40:48 You're probably right.
01:40:50 Yeah.
01:40:51 Tumblr has that as well.
01:40:52 Tump people freaked out on Tumblr and they saw that and they're like, oh my God,
01:40:55 they're going to steal our art.
01:40:56 Every girl, everybody take your art off of Tumblr.
01:40:59 And it's like it doesn't, nothing happened.
01:41:00 That's how that works.
01:41:01 Stupid.
01:41:03 Okay.
01:41:03 But it sounds, but it sounds like what I said it sounds like, but okay.
01:41:08 All right.
01:41:09 No, but no, but like the thing about that though is that society has degraded so much
01:41:16 that it could be true.
01:41:17 Yeah.
01:41:17 Yeah.
01:41:17 It could have been true.
01:41:19 And it would have been just like, just like, uh, it was so believable.
01:41:24 The fact that I thought it was.
01:41:25 Yes.
01:41:25 Yes.
01:41:26 Yes.
01:41:26 That's what I'm trying to say.
01:41:28 Uh, sorry.
01:41:30 What is a, what is the perfect part of it going to be?
01:41:32 Is it going to be like a PDF you could download?
01:41:35 Yeah.
01:41:35 Think, we're thinking PDF.
01:41:37 Yeah.
01:41:37 Just cause thinking a PDF is easy to put it all together.
01:41:41 Squish it into a file and you just download the file.
01:41:44 Maybe we could make it readable online as well in some form.
01:41:49 Interesting.
01:41:50 I mean, I think if you drag a PDF on into your browser, you can read it online.
01:41:55 Yeah.
01:41:56 You don't need a website to do that.
01:41:57 If it's a PDF, you can just look through it like that.
01:42:00 I am.
01:42:01 Right.
01:42:01 I always thought it was kind of funny when I see people on like,
01:42:05 like certain like Twitter, like artists, people that make like indie comics talk about like,
01:42:10 oh, what we need is like an American shonen jump.
01:42:12 Yeah.
01:42:13 We need a magazine with like everyone's comics in there.
01:42:16 And I'm thinking.
01:42:16 That's the BCP.
01:42:17 It's called Marvel.
01:42:18 It's called, it's called the perfect one.
01:42:20 Well, let's see.
01:42:20 Well, the thing in my head, I'm thinking like,
01:42:23 well, because they talk of the fact that they talk about like an actual magazine makes me think,
01:42:27 I think you're working backwards because no one really reads magazines.
01:42:31 Like they still make them, but they're very expensive and they're only made for a specific
01:42:36 group of much older audience who still like buy them and whatnot.
01:42:39 Right.
01:42:40 So to do a magazine is kind of like probably like working backwards.
01:42:44 There are people out there trying to do their own like American shonen jump and they all seem
01:42:49 to be doing just fine.
01:42:52 That being said, I think that I don't know.
01:42:55 I think there isn't much about precedent for that kind of stuff here.
01:43:00 I think what one of these like American shonen jump types need to do is that
01:43:04 they probably just need to have like an anime or like a cartoon based on one of their comics.
01:43:09 And then they can get more eyes on them, you know, once, once that because what,
01:43:13 what usually like having a cartoon is like, oh, the formula works guys.
01:43:18 You know, we got a cartoon just like the Japanese, right?
01:43:22 But who knows?
01:43:23 Oh, I don't know.
01:43:24 Like the industry pipeline is different over here.
01:43:27 Yeah, it's, you know, I get the appeal.
01:43:32 I mean, obviously if you have a comic and it's with a bunch of other comics and they're all in
01:43:38 one place, then every reader of every comic will see everyone else's comic and it's like,
01:43:43 oh, it's like collaboration.
01:43:44 It's like YouTube.
01:43:45 How do you prepare my video?
01:43:47 And then you cross pollinate the audiences.
01:43:51 But like, I don't know, people don't read stuff like that online.
01:43:58 The like the perfect comic party is not trying to set out to be shonen jump.
01:44:02 It's just like, wouldn't it be cool?
01:44:05 Wouldn't it be like a nice thing?
01:44:07 Like I like the aesthetic of having a little publication, having a little
01:44:12 little like a little thing, maybe printing it out.
01:44:17 I think I don't know if I'd ever go down the route of having some sort of like collective
01:44:25 magazine with everyone's comics.
01:44:28 I wonder how I wouldn't have like stuff like shonen jump originally started.
01:44:31 If it was the same thing where it was like a handful of guys,
01:44:34 somewhere where they could post their comics.
01:44:36 Actually, you know what?
01:44:37 That is how those start.
01:44:38 Never mind.
01:44:39 I remember.
01:44:41 Maybe it was a newspaper and it was like the funny.
01:44:45 And it's like, what if we had a newspaper with just the funny isn't it?
01:44:48 And it was the funny is the comments.
01:44:49 It was kind of something like that.
01:44:51 I remember I'm reminded of there's one autobiography I read from a manga co who started
01:44:57 a specific genre of manga.
01:45:01 And he was talking about how him and his brother would be friends with a bunch of other people
01:45:04 who were drawn.
01:45:04 They they just would start their own magazine.
01:45:07 And it was pretty easy to like print and like redistribute distributed like back in the day,
01:45:12 which would have been maybe the 60s.
01:45:15 And he was talking about how they would have to do something like a reader contest.
01:45:20 Because that's one of those things that would like entice people like,
01:45:23 oh, if you submit this to us, you'll get like a free so and so, you know,
01:45:28 to kind of like get more engagement out of your readers, you know.
01:45:31 I mean, doing that now, I don't I don't know.
01:45:36 I haven't heard of any like successful someone like doing it very successful.
01:45:42 I mean, what would success even look like?
01:45:44 You know, it would look like you buy the thing and it's like,
01:45:47 oh, Scott Pilgrim and Homestuck in the same place.
01:45:50 Oh, God, that sounds like a nightmare.
01:45:53 But they could they could they could they could cross over like, oh, my God, John Egbert.
01:45:58 What are you doing in my comment?
01:46:00 I'm thinking about like, because it's funny how the more I learned about like,
01:46:04 how indeed creative people are doing, the more I realized like,
01:46:07 I'm literally doing the same thing they're doing.
01:46:09 It's just that they're more popular than me.
01:46:12 There was this one guy who made a post on Instagram talking about how his comic is like
01:46:17 published through Fantagraphics, which is one of the bigger publishers, right?
01:46:21 But the fact is that like Fantagraphics only sold like four copies of his comic last year.
01:46:27 Like only people only four people bought copies of it, which is crazy because it's like,
01:46:32 this is supposed to be Fantagraphics.
01:46:33 It's supposed to be one of the bigger publishers.
01:46:35 But I guess they're not like super interested in advertising this guy or they do the kind
01:46:40 of thing where they expect since like every like artists nowadays is like a pseudo influencer.
01:46:46 They expect you to do the majority of the marketing for them and they don't have to spend money,
01:46:50 you know, of course, Fantagraphic does market certain comics, but they only market their most
01:46:56 popular stuff or stuff that like, because Fantagraphic does do specific like they translate
01:47:03 like specific older manga, they republish very old like Mickey Mouse comics.
01:47:08 That's like another thing they do, you know, and sure they do publish like the indie stuff,
01:47:13 but it seems like they only like push the indie stuff when it's someone like popular or someone
01:47:18 who like, you know, already like made a big name for themselves somehow, you know.
01:47:23 And when this guy was talking about like his situation of like what he's going through and
01:47:28 how like, oh, he they only sold four copies for a big publisher.
01:47:32 I'm thinking like, well, maybe I'm kind of doing the right thing in a way because with
01:47:38 how I'm just like doing the pre-orders and and it's the self publishing that way.
01:47:44 I've heard I've heard like professionals say like if they were starting out now, like people
01:47:51 like I've heard people say like I get if they get asked like, how do I break into the publishing
01:47:56 industry? How do I get a publisher? And they just like don't like if I if I were starting out now,
01:48:01 I would just do self publishing. I would self publish everything I would I wouldn't worry about
01:48:06 publisher. But I just want someone to do the work for me. I want someone to do the hard part
01:48:10 for me. I don't want to do marketing. That's that's kind of like the annoying thing. I mean,
01:48:15 I to be honest, I really don't really do marketing to be honest, which is what the funny.
01:48:20 I know that's a funny thing for me to say come especially coming from me, right? What the fuck?
01:48:26 But like it's it's it's it's tough out there. I remember I'm not out there. Thank you.
01:48:35 Last year I was talking to I talked to a small like I talked to a couple of small publishers
01:48:40 and it's funny how they're just kind of already doing the thing I'm doing and I'm wondering
01:48:44 like why am I even approaching these guys? One guy I talked to saying like, yeah, I um,
01:48:50 yeah, like I told them about like one time I did pre orders for for villain verse.
01:48:56 I made like around $2,000. And this guy saying like, damn, we never made that amount of money
01:49:02 ever in our publisher. Right. There you go. And another time I was asking because I went around
01:49:08 I was asking for smaller publishers and saying like, Hey, do you guys um,
01:49:11 do you guys help me like get this specific kind of printing? And they told me like,
01:49:15 oh, we probably can't do that. But you should go to this printer. And the one they recommended
01:49:18 was the one I already used for everything else. And they told me that they use that printer. And
01:49:22 I'm like, Oh, why do I even need to use your guys? Like what I it's it's it's interesting because
01:49:30 it's like they kind of have a name locally. So I guess that's like the benefit. But it's like,
01:49:36 what's the point, you know, I just got the box from the printer with the copies of the rad con
01:49:43 dojin. The people that the people that the cut the few people that purchased a print copy from me,
01:49:51 I will be sending those. Yes, I found it on my doorstep yesterday. I think I ordered like 30 copies
01:49:57 and I think I sold like less than half of that many, including like the people that I'm just
01:50:02 giving free ones to because they wrote the script and drew and drew the comments. So I've got like
01:50:08 a bunch left. Hey, everyone, st comics.com slash store.html buy buy one of these, please get it
01:50:17 with the combo combo with wrote to rad con. It's the rad combo. But I already have wrote to read
01:50:23 the buy to please. It's fine.
01:50:36 This is why you should never be a distributor. It's okay. You'll have you'll have boxes and boxes
01:50:42 of stuff. You know what's purchased. Honestly, that's why I do pre orders. I hate the idea of
01:50:48 having a shillard of boxes of comics that no one's buying. I have like, oh, that makes sense.
01:50:53 That's smart. Yeah, I didn't even think about it. Yeah, I mean, I like you know how many people
01:50:58 are going to buy it. So you get exactly that amount. You know, what's my you know, what's my
01:51:02 dream position? Like if I had to choose where I would want my life to be is so and my big example
01:51:09 for this is the mega 64 podcast, they do this kind of interesting thing that's a pretty smart on
01:51:14 their side where like, when an episode of their podcast drops, they say on that episode, hey,
01:51:21 and you only get the news through the episode, it's like, hey, we're going to have a 42 hour
01:51:25 special on this shirt starting from when this episode drops. So you should get it now. Right.
01:51:31 And it's like, damn, imagine like having that big of a podcast where you could say like, hey,
01:51:35 we're having you could do a pre order, like the podcast episode is the announcement for the
01:51:38 pre order, like, hey, like, you know, you, you get the pre order for this and it's like limited so
01:51:43 and so at that time, right. And that kind of like, you know, incentivize people to like go buy it in
01:51:47 that moment, like once that episode drops, right. And that's, that's kind of like where I I think
01:51:54 that's what position I would like to be. And it won't even be like, I think if I if I get like,
01:52:00 because I do have like a local San Diego comic collective, that are pretty cool people and I
01:52:05 really love the people there. I would love to get to a point where that that collected on part of
01:52:11 if I'm not even like, I guess our own podcast or something like that, where we just announced
01:52:18 the stuff, you just pre order like right away, like on the podcast itself, you know,
01:52:25 that that's kind of like where I want to go with all this, to be honest.
01:52:31 Then marking which take care of itself. Yep. Yeah, exactly. It's got to get clout. You just
01:52:38 got to get clout. You got to get clout. What I'm thinking of doing is I make Clarissa or in the
01:52:44 process of making Clarissa, I get back into making videos and I make like banger videos that everyone
01:52:51 loves. And then I can say go from YouTube, this massive website, to my tiny little Amazon thing,
01:52:58 buy my comic or read it even. And they'll all be mine.
01:53:05 Tee hee, I'll make hypocrite videos for money. Who would have thought of such a thing?
01:53:12 That's amazing. Were you were you're not making it for money before?
01:53:15 No, I was making it because I love making videos. I thought it was so cool. I thought it'd be so
01:53:20 famous, famous like just like the the just like the guy with the glasses just like Doug Walker.
01:53:27 It's like Jon Tron. Yeah. I mean, unironically, that's why I started. Actually, there was a part
01:53:35 of me was like, oh, you can make money on YouTube. So it was also for money. But mostly because I
01:53:43 wanted to be like one of the cool gamers on the website. I think I could have done it if I didn't
01:53:51 hate it. If I didn't get burnt out. That's so true. I mean, what everyone needs like their own
01:54:03 little cash cow, like their own little thing of above that people love, they're like, oh, I love
01:54:08 this, I'll buy it. You know, everyone needs their own little Smash Bros, which is like tough. Yeah.
01:54:14 In the future, everyone will have their own little Smash Bros.
01:54:20 Do you guys watch Little Joel? Yeah, most of yeah, I often I haven't seen them all.
01:54:26 But Little Joel is the true successor to Digi After Dark.
01:54:33 Yeah, only good. But Little Joel made a video about like how he made a popular video.
01:54:43 And people make art that is your passion about it. It's like, nah, just make art is popular. So
01:54:49 you get to feel good about it and you get the money and it's great. I'm like, you know what,
01:54:53 I need more of that, that energy in my life. Yeah. Because I have spent my entire twenties
01:55:00 being like, no, I'm an artist. I have to do things I'm passionate about. Yeah. Look where I am now.
01:55:05 Well, I'm not nowhere on the Procrastinators podcast. I'm on the Procrastinators podcast.
01:55:11 I need to I need to get big and popular enough where like people don't like because unsolicited
01:55:17 advice, kind of rude, kind of cringe, right? But if you're popular enough, you give that
01:55:22 unsolicited advice and they'll be sucking your dick. Oh my god. They'll lap it up.
01:55:28 I learned more from this guy's from this guy's roast of me than I did in my entire college
01:55:34 career that I spent $500,000 to get. Ben, would you rather have $1 million or a dinner with
01:55:41 cheesy Manfredo? That dinner will pay will pay for itself every day of the rest of my life
01:55:48 with what I learned from it. Exactly. Because they'll tell you like what to do and my advice
01:55:51 would be kind of like, ah, is there anything? Is there something popular that you really like
01:55:55 right now? I just do your version of that. That's it. That's my advice. Yeah. So would you rather
01:56:01 have a billion dollars or a fortune cookie written by Oscar Wilde? I'll be honest. Something.
01:56:09 With that little Joel, he's talking about like he did the he did that series of three sort of
01:56:17 like kind of artsy like essays, the ones about like Godzilla and like global warming. Yeah.
01:56:22 And those were okay. I didn't hate them. I didn't really love them either. They were they were good.
01:56:29 Yeah. They're more heady than and then and the one you made more recently was more poppy and like
01:56:35 yeah clickable. I didn't like that. I didn't like the new one. I thought I thought the new one was
01:56:39 bad. It's boring. It's like trigger you one. Yeah. I feel like he's literally made the same video
01:56:45 before. It's terrible. So I feel I get I get that like yeah, his like artsy one didn't wasn't a huge
01:56:54 hit. And like, you know, that's fine. I don't I don't like that the lesson he took away from it
01:56:59 is just make the same crap over and over. Like I know he's I know he's just joshin. I know he's
01:57:04 kind of just joshin. He's kind of just joshin. I think it's it's just you can get like stuck
01:57:13 trying to go for only artistic masterpieces when it doesn't actually take that much out of you to
01:57:20 just throw a little crowd pleaser out there so often to keep yourself going and to make yourself
01:57:27 feel accomplished. Yeah. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that.
01:57:33 Yeah. Well, you know, that's but that's not how the coolest people ever constantly were making
01:57:40 bangers and they were never doing anything that sucked. I feel a little bit stupid because it's
01:57:45 been so many months. It's been like five months since the Mega Man lecture. But like that was
01:57:50 kind of my plan with get back into doing lectures. Like that's that's the crowd pleaser.
01:57:56 And then I have not followed up lectures and then be like, oh, this lecture was sponsored by
01:58:00 Biska Page. Biska Page. They're great. Yeah. They're Biska Page. They're great. Exactly.
01:58:10 Okay. And you know what's that? I got I got to get going. Okay. Cheesy eggs is out here. All right.
01:58:17 Okay. Yeah, I appreciate you guys have no sweat. Now people are going to complain that Cheesy made
01:58:24 the episode longer. I was the one complaining the most. So yeah, I won't complain again. I'll find
01:58:34 other things to complain about. All right. Good. All right. Good. Have a good day. Talk to you guys
01:58:41 later. Later. I was going to say, yeah, the me deciding deciding to do more lectures and the
01:58:48 Mega Man lecture in particular was me being like, I should just do the things people like.
01:58:52 I should just make the things that people liked and that were successful.
01:58:57 And then I did it once and I was like, well, I did it. No need to continue doing that.
01:59:01 But I should and I really, you know, I mean, you've been working on the battle network, haven't
01:59:08 you? Yeah. Yeah. That wasn't the next lecture, but that's a lecture. So you're still doing a
01:59:12 lecture. That is work on it on a future lecture that I am doing. That's true. You know, I've been,
01:59:18 I've been putting off really getting to work on the net on the next lecture because
01:59:23 whenever it's time to work, I'm like, well, I got to work on the I got to work on Biska Page.
01:59:27 Got to work on, you know, get the perfect comic party. So that's. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know,
01:59:34 soon as the first issues out, I'll be like, okay, time to step back and the next the next thing on
01:59:39 my to do list after get the perfect comic party sort of up and running to to whatever extent,
01:59:45 then the next thing is, all right, let's let's do it. Let's do the next lecture.
01:59:49 I got freaking Etsy ghosted me. I ordered some stuff from Etsy for like the video for the
01:59:57 slime and punishment video. And it just didn't come. I paid like $45 for some fabric. And it
02:00:06 just didn't come. And I guess I'm going to have to complain about it. Was it was it sent but not
02:00:12 tracked or something? Yes, it was it said it was sent, but it was it's not they didn't have tracking
02:00:17 on it. And it said it was supposed to arrive by like three days ago. So we're past the time
02:00:23 when like, I should be complaining. But I haven't done it. It's the most annoying, isn't it? When
02:00:29 it's not tracked, so it could arrive as soon as you like buy another one. Yeah. It could just be
02:00:36 running. You don't know that it's going to. So it's like, you can't afford to wait, wait around. So
02:00:41 you got to kind of buy the next one. Yeah. And then it arrives anyway. And it's like, I'm not
02:00:47 buying. I'm not buying another one. I'm going to I'm going to complain until they refund me
02:00:50 because this is bullshit. At least at least it's for the slime and punishment thing, which it turns
02:00:56 out I didn't need that soon because I have wait, no, wait, no, before, no, before I do the next
02:01:02 lecture, I have to do the slime and punishment. I have to do the slime and punishment. Never mind.
02:01:05 I take it back. I take back the order I said. Well, why do you have to do the slime and punishment?
02:01:10 Because I just need I just I just need to do it. I just need I just needs to be done.
02:01:17 The book, the Kickstarter just needs it should have done this Kickstarter like three years ago.
02:01:25 Well, and I just had to start it. And then when it's running, I can be working on the lecture
02:01:31 while the Kickstarter is running. I don't have to spend the entire month focused on it. So that's
02:01:36 that's the actual order. PCP, Perfect Comic Party, then that done. OK, make a video and launch the
02:01:44 slime and punishment Kickstarter. OK, and then while that's running, work on the next lecture.
02:01:50 OK, too many things, too many freaking things on my to do list. Irons in the fire.
02:01:57 I yeah, irons in that. Yeah, feels better to look at them as irons in the fire.
02:02:02 Then then items on an on a on a list of things that never seems to get any shorter.
02:02:11 It never will. That's the annoying truth is that the list I've been keeping track of a thing,
02:02:17 like a list of things I got to get done. And it never really goes away. There's just a few
02:02:22 things that stay on there for so long, because it's like, that's hard. And that's like, I don't know
02:02:26 how to start that thing. And it's like tiny little bits, little updates to the site, like, oh,
02:02:31 there's a glitch there. I should go into the code and figure out what's what's not correct.
02:02:38 And now I got to do my taxes. I got my tax letter as well. But it said, like, you've got until
02:02:45 January 2024 to pay last year's taxes. So I guess I've already done my taxes in January.
02:02:52 I guess Americans have them in April or for the previous year's taxes are due in April of the
02:02:59 next year. Yeah. Yeah, I always have my tax thing like around Christmas, like, oh,
02:03:04 shit, I should have done my taxes before the Christmas holidays. Now I got to do them during
02:03:08 January. It doesn't really take that long. But it doesn't really take that long. Like, I have all
02:03:15 my I have all my open up all of my yeah, all the things. The thing that takes long is going back
02:03:21 through all my expenses and trying to be like that counts as a business expense that counts as a
02:03:25 business expense. Yeah. And tallying all that all that stuff up. Oh, yeah, you got to make you
02:03:32 got to make YouTube videos of all the things you buy, just hold them up to the camera. So
02:03:37 there's YouTube contents part of my brands part of my thing. It's just I got to go back
02:03:43 through my bank statements. And every time I see an item, if I like, was that was that for a video?
02:03:48 Was that for a comic? Was that for some other potential future money making endeavor? Oh,
02:03:53 all my all my ingredients for all my gummies. Well, I intend to. Yeah, I just ate those. But you
02:03:59 know, I intend to sell them at some point in the future. So that's a business expense. That's
02:04:04 like research and development expense. Ooh, I just got I just got a I just got a gallon jug
02:04:12 of blackstrap molasses. I'm going to try I think after this is going to try chugging that I'm good.
02:04:19 I'm going to I'm going to try I'm going to try licorice again, and I'm going to try replacing
02:04:25 I'm going to try replacing a priori replace the liquid sugar, a priori replace the invert sugar
02:04:32 with blackstrap molasses and just see what happens. Are you going to invert the molasses?
02:04:38 I think it's probably already inverted or it's some other kind of sugar. I don't know.
02:04:45 Yes, I don't know anything about all that. It's it's very food. It's very mysterious.
02:04:52 Cornstarch. It's very mysterious. Listen, when you cook down sugar, starch,
02:04:57 there is corn oil, corn sugar, corn syrup, syrup, high fructose corn syrup.
02:05:04 I use the non high fructose kind. All right, when you cook down sugar, you cook it,
02:05:09 it gets this first it becomes the softball, then it becomes the firm ball, then it becomes hardball,
02:05:17 then it becomes crackling out brand. Wait, no, it's like a hard cube.
02:05:25 The soft the softball stage. No, no, no. Here we go. Here we go. Softball,
02:05:31 firm ball, hardball, soft crack and hard crack. There you go. So that's that's the goal is to get
02:05:38 that hard crack. I'm all about that hard crack. Speaking of crack, I bought on eBay the bionicles.
02:05:49 You know the bionicles? You ever heard of them? Yeah. I love them and I have been missing them
02:05:56 for decades or whatever. I never had. I didn't realize. I didn't realize that the original six
02:06:03 were like cheap and like not a problem. I got the whole set. Yeah, they were a very popular
02:06:10 toy. So I'm not surprised they're available. Yeah, I thought like, oh, bionicle collectors,
02:06:17 this probably like it's and it's an old thing. So it's like I assumed it would go up in price
02:06:21 like a video game cartridge would. No, no, no. You just I just have them now and they're back.
02:06:28 They've been gone for so long. They've been gone for so long. My product my prodigal sons have
02:06:33 returned. There's Metsunui. There's Shiranui. No, no, Shiranui is from Okami. There's Uigui.
02:06:46 There's Lewa, Topeka. I've only learned these by looking at the wiki because I forgot what
02:06:52 their names were. Sean in Topanga. There's Gali, there's Pohatu, Onu, Onganguga. This is racist.
02:07:00 This is racist. It's a little bit racist. A little bit racist. But I love them. They're little masks
02:07:09 and the fact that their skull has the like see-through plastic. So if you shine a light behind
02:07:15 it or if the sun's behind it, blasts through so they've got like green or red like glowing eyes.
02:07:21 Hang on. They're the coolest. I love them. I'm going to carefully examine.
02:07:27 Wait, they have a skull? Yeah, like did you never have a bionicle?
02:07:31 No, never. I thought they had like a mask. Yeah, the mask that attaches like in the mouth. The
02:07:37 mouth is like a like a you could put a Lego stud in there. I don't think a Lego stud would
02:07:42 actually fit, but like imagine that. And the mask is a clips onto their mouth and their head is like
02:07:49 a gray like skull sort of thing. Look at what I found. The gray skull is like their brain,
02:07:55 which is like a crystal of a clear plastic, colored plastic. Mine too. Light shines through it
02:08:03 and they've got different eye colors and it's looks so cool. I found this was the second like
02:08:08 like eBay result when I searched for bionicle. Well, don't search for such things. I searched
02:08:16 for bionicle and this is what I found. It's your search history. There's a lot of they know
02:08:21 what you've been looking at pornography on eBay. I'm so I'm so horny. I'm going to log on to eBay
02:08:27 and buy some ironic sculptures just to just to rub out a quick one. Is that Jasmine from the
02:08:33 Disney's Aladdin? Hang on. Bionicle. No mask. Show me. Show me the mask was.
02:08:44 Oh, ew. Yeah, they're kind of like gross weirdos. They're kind of gross weirdos,
02:08:50 but their masks make them so cool instantly. It's amazing. Like you take the mask off and it's like,
02:08:56 oh, this guy is fucked. Oh, then you put the mask on. You put the mask on and it's like,
02:09:05 and that's cool. I remember there was these bionicles and then I was looking into this because
02:09:11 I was trying to figure out when I fell off the bionicle bandwagon and they had different like
02:09:18 every year it was like in 2001 or 2000 they released and every year they would be like a new
02:09:27 line of bionicles. The second year was these little round guys, these little circular like snakemen
02:09:35 and they would be also of the like six genders, six elements. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:09:43 Cool. And they had like an action figure thing where you pulled a little piece of Lego at the
02:09:49 back of their neck and their head would jump forward like a snake and then they could roll
02:09:55 into a ball and like roll around like Samus Aran from Metroid. I watched like a video explaining
02:10:03 like the history of bionicles not that long ago. Not like the in-world lore, but like the
02:10:09 production and like the iterations that Lego went through of like releasing a bunch of themed
02:10:17 action figures that were elemental. Yeah. Of which there were several different ones and
02:10:22 bionicle was merely one and was the most well known and successful.
02:10:28 Very strange. A lot of people keep. One of the most popular requests I get for what's your next
02:10:34 lecture going to be is on bionicle lore, which I guess there's lore there. I say that it sounds
02:10:44 terrible, but I don't know. Maybe it's funny. Maybe it's cool. I mean, there's enough of it
02:10:48 that you could have like good stuff. I'm pretty sure the comics, I've seen parts of a comic before
02:10:55 that came with like one of the Lego figures is like the comic looks good. It's like genuinely
02:11:00 cool looking. I don't know if the story is good, but like. I mean, like what's there like there's
02:11:05 like an animated series. There's a toy series. There's a toy set. There's a film. There's a
02:11:10 video games. The whole thing. That's not that much lore. I don't think it'd be that hard to
02:11:14 explain, right? Like it's not Mega Man where there's like 45 different video games. Oh, no, no, not
02:11:21 at all. I don't even know if it would be that hard. Maybe I should just do it. Maybe I should just do it.
02:11:27 Maybe I should. Wait a minute. Maybe I should just make a video that would be popular and
02:11:30 that people want to see. Oh my goodness. What the fuck? No, but my, no, but my art. Oh, my artistic
02:11:38 purity, the purity of my artistic intention, demand that I make my next lecture about a
02:11:44 fucking battle network. It's just so artistically pure. It's like in the wake of,
02:11:51 um, remember, remember, uh, you know, Nate had the, um, the freaking, uh, the weaponized
02:11:59 thickness. I don't know if I mentioned this in the, in the vlog that he made immediately
02:12:04 following the viral success of weaponized thickness when that video got 2 million views.
02:12:09 He says like, I could make t-shirts of it. People have asked me for weaponized thickness
02:12:15 t-shirts and I could do them and they would sell and it would make me money, but I won't do it.
02:12:21 I can't do it because I'm just a slave to, but it's like my pure, it's like not my pure artistic
02:12:28 vision. Uh, yeah. He's like, I can't, it's too commercial. Like it's too, it's too crass. He
02:12:36 doesn't say it in this many words. I'm paraphrasing, but basically he's like, it's too crass and
02:12:40 commercial and I just don't want to do it. I'm an artist. I'm not some kind of, I'm not some kind of
02:12:44 merch hawker. I'll never make t-shirts. Right. The nickel, the nickel. Uh, it's just weird. It's
02:12:55 just weird. Like why, why not just make a shirt? Why not just make a shirt? Maybe it's just annoying,
02:13:02 but I feel like you could easily have made a weaponized thickness thing.
02:13:06 Yeah. I mean, he said so. He said people, he said, he said people are asking for it.
02:13:11 Yes. Short-card gothic, of course. He said, he said people are asking for one. He knew they would
02:13:16 sell, but he won't do it because it's not art. I don't know. Before we end this section, I just want
02:13:28 to post the third generation of these guys. So they were like villain bionicles and they had
02:13:34 staves and these, I remember having one of these and that's, I think was 2003 and 2004.
02:13:43 I think 2004 onwards was when they just did the original six, but they had different masks
02:13:50 and I felt like the masks weren't as good. And so I was, I fell off. I was like, nah.
02:13:56 But that's when apparently, 2004 onwards is apparently where it got really big and like
02:14:00 there was so much stuff, those video games and all that in the movie. And I'm like,
02:14:04 by that point, I was gone. I was out of it. I was out of the game.
02:14:11 Graduated. Graduated as they say in the VTuber space. Yeah. They won't let me back.
02:14:21 I got a pee. You know what I mean? You know what, me too.
02:14:25 Hey, hello.
02:14:29 Sorry, I was eating a bacon sandwich. It was very yummy. That was fast.
02:14:33 It was only a small sandwich. It really wolfed it. I wolfed it. I wanted to get back to the show.
02:14:39 So much. Do you want to talk about One Piece?
02:14:44 New One Piece chapter? Yeah, I think so. Okay. Okay. Well, guess what?
02:14:53 What? There's a new One Piece chapter and it's called Chapter 1080, The Hero of Legend.
02:15:03 And we see there's a bunch of new fruits. 1080p.
02:15:11 Let's see. Okay. So it's my vague recollections. There's a bunch of the Blackbeard pirates have
02:15:20 a bunch of new fruits. One of their guys is an island man, and he just is the island that they're
02:15:26 on. That's pretty wacky. Pizarro. I don't remember if these fruits, they already had them.
02:15:34 Some of these I don't remember. I'm not sure if they had them already. I know the Hero did not
02:15:39 have the invisible fruit. They got that from the Moria's subordinate. Who's that guy? Absalom.
02:15:50 I remember him getting it from Absalom. Blackbeard using his, I forget, what even happened?
02:15:58 This is the part where all the people who read One Piece and know it are pissing themselves with
02:16:03 rage that we don't already know the things we're thinking about. Here's the ones. I think,
02:16:09 I don't remember. I've never seen an island island fruit before. I've never seen the glug glug
02:16:14 fruit before. I've never seen the huge, huge fruit before. Yeah, these are reveals, I guess,
02:16:19 of their fruits. These are reveals. I don't know if we got them recently. I mean,
02:16:24 San Juan Wolf is already huge. What does it mean that he has eaten the huge, huge fruit?
02:16:31 Well, if you look at him in comparison to other giants, he is far larger than any giant ever in
02:16:39 history. And so people are like, why is he so big? And it's because he's a giant that ate
02:16:45 a devil fruit that also makes you big. So he's just bigger than the average giant.
02:16:50 Do you think he had already eaten it before? Oh, yeah. I think that's like he walks along
02:16:56 the ocean floor and it makes him tired because he's a devil fruit user.
02:17:00 Hmm. Yeah, okay. That might, yeah. I guess I believe that.
02:17:07 Pizarro being an island fruit, it sort of feels very similar to that guy in the
02:17:16 Indress Rosa who has the something something turns into a mountain or stone or like the
02:17:23 like terrain terrain fruit or something like that. Something of that nature. So I guess this is just
02:17:29 the same thing, but bigger. Yeah.
02:17:34 Everyone's so fucking big. You just, I guess he can do it with a whole island,
02:17:39 but he can only do it with natural terrain. Well, no, no, no, because he becomes,
02:17:45 he becomes the wooden floorboards and he becomes like the brick wall.
02:17:50 Yeah, it's a pretty wacky because he's if he's an island, surely he feels the
02:17:56 the edge of the ocean lapping at his himself. Surely that makes him weaker
02:18:03 if he can constantly be in contact with the ocean. Yeah, an island, wait, an island is in
02:18:09 the ocean. What the fuck? Yeah, so that's pretty fucked up. Oh, and then this lady with the whip
02:18:17 whip fruit. Yes, I love all of the sword members. I don't really know what she's doing with her whip.
02:18:25 Oh, okay. She's just, she's whipping a building and making it move? Yeah, she's got a devil fruit
02:18:33 that makes inanimate objects react to her, what do you call it, like dominatrix whipping.
02:18:44 It's like move back boy, be a good boy and move and the building does as she's told, as it's told.
02:18:51 It's very interesting, fascinating. So yeah, we're on Pirate Island is Blackbeard's land
02:19:02 or is territory and we've got the Blackbeard Pirates just fucking around and Kobe, who we knew
02:19:07 was with. It's called Fulaled. Pirate Island Fulaled is what my translation says. I'm reading
02:19:16 the Viz translation. Ah, Hachinossu. Yeah, so yeah, Fulaled probably cooler and whatever that means.
02:19:27 Well, maybe it literally is that. That's localization, baby. Yes. So yeah, there's the cross guild,
02:19:37 Buggy's thing. I was going to say the bounty on Kobe, that's from Buggy's crew, right? Yeah,
02:19:43 Buggy's organization. The cross guild. Because I would assume it is a guild where you don't cross
02:19:54 them, I don't know. Very honestly, very cool to see bounties out on marines. I just think that's
02:20:00 really fun. Yeah, I like that aspect of Buggy's progression. He's always getting people to fight
02:20:09 for him and what better way to get people to fight the marines than to put bounties on their heads
02:20:14 and he's got so much power and wealth that he can afford that. It's really funny.
02:20:22 It's pretty awesome and they have a star rating. Apparently one star is about,
02:20:29 one star is one treasure chest, which is worth about a million berries.
02:20:34 So why not just average in millions? It is very abusing that they
02:20:40 pirate treasure chests of booty. Right, right.
02:20:48 Yeah, so Blackbeard, we saw Blackbeard's ship heading in the direction of egg land.
02:20:57 Yes. And so I was hypothesizing that Kobe-
02:21:01 I thought we saw him. No, no, I guess we didn't see him. We just saw his flag.
02:21:06 The things we've seen Blackbeard going on about recently are Blackbeard fighting Law
02:21:11 and I presume that because Kid was defeated by Shanks, Law was probably defeated by Blackbeard
02:21:19 and then Blackbeard is on his way after that to Luffy at, what's it called? Is it New Egg?
02:21:25 What's it called? Egghead. Egghead. He's on his way to Egghead.
02:21:31 New Egg is that website you can buy computer parts for?
02:21:34 That's right, yes. I mean, it's basically the same. Sure.
02:21:39 You can get computer parts at Vegapunks Island.
02:21:45 And so this, I think, takes place before that because we knew Kobe was captured by Blackbeard.
02:21:50 I assumed he was on the ship and we might see him at Egghead and if he's escaping now,
02:21:58 which I assume is before. But then, I don't know, what do you think could happen here?
02:22:06 Because Kobe is trying to escape. He's getting all of these other people,
02:22:10 these prisoners escaping is like he's being a hero. And then the Blackbeard pirates are just
02:22:15 fucking around and they think, haha, whatever, stupid Kobe, no chance. But then Kobe's friends,
02:22:23 Kobe's comrades, Nakama, they're coming in and they've really got some cool powers
02:22:31 and they're showing up and they're being all epic.
02:22:34 These aren't just regular cops. These are renegade cops that are above the law.
02:22:39 They're taking the law into their own hands. Taking the law into their own hands. They got a
02:22:43 license to kill. They're going to turn in their gun and their badge.
02:22:48 Oh, I really like Hibari. She's using, she's the one with the rifle.
02:22:53 She was using the, she was the Vegapunk flower, flower shot.
02:22:57 Yeah, the flower shot. That's cool. Also, I really like her weird fucking clown tights and like army
02:23:05 shoe combo. Yeah, she's cute. Yeah, the stripe, I like the stripe tights. Very cute. Oh, it's on one
02:23:13 leg. Oh yes, it's ripped off at one leg. That's fun. And she's like, haha, it's not like I like
02:23:20 you or anything, Kobe. Kobe's getting all of these ladies. He's surrounded by them. It's great.
02:23:28 Have we seen this clay man with the Prince of Groose? He looks kind of familiar.
02:23:34 I don't think we've seen any of these people before. I think they're all
02:23:38 like new, except, well, obviously, except for Garp. I don't think there was,
02:23:46 there was a bit earlier, Tashiki's here as well, where there was, and Helm Epo.
02:23:56 Helm Epo, everybody's favorite. Helm Epo alongside some other girl who was crying
02:24:02 that Kobe's been stolen by Blackbeard and saying, Garp, we gotta go save him.
02:24:08 I forget. I don't think, well, she's probably in a panel here, but not prominently featured.
02:24:14 She's not one of these new people. Just some steak. Yeah. Hey, why is Alkegi here?
02:24:25 Alkegi, if you remember, fought against Akainu and created Punk Hazard at the end
02:24:33 after the Marenford thing, and it was over a disagreement about the Marines and how things
02:24:39 should be run, and so they fought about it, and Alkegi left, and then he joined Blackbeard.
02:24:47 He joined Blackbeard? Yeah, he joined Blackbeard after that, and he's like,
02:24:51 I forgot that. Yeah, he's been part of Blackbeard's crew or an ally. I'm assuming he's part of the
02:24:57 crew. I don't really know what his deal is because he doesn't seem like the sort of guy who would
02:25:02 just join to be part of the bad guys. I don't think he wants to kill people. Maybe Blackbeard
02:25:08 has more of a plan than we're led to believe. That's very strange to me that Alkegi would
02:25:15 join Blackbeard. I feel like Alkegi's joining Blackbeard not because he agrees with Blackbeard,
02:25:21 but because it's advantageous to whatever ends Alkegi has. He must be doing something.
02:25:26 Because I like Alkegi, he seems like an upstanding fellow, and Blackbeard seems like a bit of a
02:25:33 scoundrel and not quite the same level of, I don't know. Blackbeard's just out for himself,
02:25:41 so I don't get what's the appeal of working with him for someone like Alkegi.
02:25:47 Being on a powerful pirate crew to insulate him from the Marines or something?
02:25:52 Yeah, I mean, yeah. Or like influencing him from the inside?
02:25:56 Maybe Alkegi just wants to join the witting side.
02:26:02 Could be something like that, I don't know. I feel like the fact that he let Nico Robin go
02:26:07 all those years ago means that he doesn't actually believe the Marines are the good guys, fully.
02:26:11 Yeah, definitely, definitely. Okay, yeah, well I forgot. I was shocked to see him here,
02:26:21 but I guess that explains it. We unfortunately do not get to see what the glug glug fruit does.
02:26:29 Yeah, it just makes bubbles like Glowbox and Rayman 3.
02:26:34 Rayman 3! No, no, no. That's the huge... That's San Juan Wolf making the bubbles,
02:26:41 making the snot bubbles. No, it's Vasco shot, isn't it?
02:26:44 Well, no, Vasco shot is riding a bubble, but the bubbles are just coming out of the San Juan
02:26:50 Wolf's nose or whatever. I don't think that's a fruit power. I think that guy, I think he's just
02:26:56 a snotty boy. Vasco, what you doing? He's gonna drink that snot later and it's gonna give him
02:27:05 so much power. So he's called a booze man, heavy drinker, he ate the glug glug fruit.
02:27:12 And he's drinking booze. I assume that means he can
02:27:17 inebriate people and things like that, turn water into wine and he's like,
02:27:24 oh my goodness, is Jesus? Yeah, I mean, it could be. I'll turn your blood alcohol
02:27:32 levels a little too high and then you'll fall over. It could be a logia, I guess, but probably not.
02:27:37 I mean, he's made of alcohol, he's set him on fire.
02:27:44 Yes, that would be pretty easy actually. Okay, okay. Let's see here, I mean, what's...
02:27:56 So the other thing about this, there's Maria. Yes, Corona and Maria.
02:28:03 Yeah, so Corona, I guess, is outside and she gave the keys to Kobe so that he could free Maria
02:28:14 and free himself. So there's like a little alliance there. I'm sure Kobe will hold up
02:28:20 his end of the bargain because he's a good boy, which means Maria will be back in the game in some
02:28:27 fashion, which is interesting. We haven't seen Maria for so many years.
02:28:33 Were we just talking like a couple of weeks ago about how is Maria even still alive?
02:28:38 Yeah, I mean, I thought he died at the Battle of Marenford and I guess he didn't.
02:28:46 I don't remember when it was made clear. I think it became overtly clear when
02:28:54 Absalom came to Blackbird and said, please let my captain go. So I'm like, okay, he's alive.
02:29:00 But maybe it was already made clear in some other fashion earlier than that.
02:29:06 But yeah, he's been, like ever since Luffy beat him,
02:29:10 he's been taking Ls. I wonder what's going to happen because he's got a powerful fruit.
02:29:18 Well, maybe he doesn't have it anymore. Maybe Blackbird stole his fruit.
02:29:21 Is the one that he can just put people's shadows into other things and it animates those things
02:29:27 and turns them into zombies or whatever? Specifically, he takes your shadow away from you
02:29:33 and can put it wherever he wants. He can put it in himself. He can put it inside a zombie.
02:29:39 But if you don't have a shadow and the sun hits you, you burn to death.
02:29:43 Right. Which is the scary thing about having no shadow is that you burn in the sunlight.
02:29:51 I forgot about that. That was the whole ticking clock at the end of Thriller Bark where
02:29:55 Thriller Bark, because of various things that happened on the island, the ship that's an island,
02:30:00 it's not the Bermuda Triangle, but it's a version of that big cloud that's constantly
02:30:09 nighttime and it was drifting out of it because somebody had broken the rudder or something
02:30:13 during all the fighting. And for the first time in a long time, the sun was rising and everyone
02:30:18 who didn't have a shadow was like, we got to kill Moria and get our shadows back. Otherwise,
02:30:23 we'll all burn to death. That was so cool. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah.
02:30:29 And then he took, he took a, right, he took Brooke's shadow and put it, and that was Ryuma,
02:30:33 right? And he put Brooke's shadow into Ryuma. Yeah. Okay. That's how Zora got the sword.
02:30:38 Ah, so many things. They all come back. Yeah. So like, I'm excited to see how
02:30:44 Moria comes back into the story in some small way. And Perona, obviously, she's been around
02:30:51 with Hawkeye, but then when Hawkeye lost his immunity from the Marines, he had to go into
02:30:56 hiding and Perona had to run away. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. As one does. And so like, I don't know where
02:31:04 Hogback is. I've never not seen him in a while. Wouldn't it be cool if like the Thriller Bark
02:31:13 completely forgot about Hogback? Didn't expect to ever see Hogback again.
02:31:18 But maybe. Yeah, Hogback. And what's the lady who's a zombie who's like throws dinner plates?
02:31:27 It's like the lady he made to be his wife, but she hates him even though he created her. Oh,
02:31:32 God, yeah. Right. And she just hates dinner plates. And I forget, I think it's because of
02:31:38 the shadow she has in her that causes that. I got a reread Thriller Bark. That's one of the arcs
02:31:48 that I have not gone back to. I've gone back to reread, look at earliest stuff. I'm actually doing
02:31:56 a reread with a bunch of people, including Manchi, who is now going to be reading One Piece.
02:32:03 Yes, I've heard about that. Very exciting. But I've not reread everything. And so certain parts
02:32:10 have just not gone. I've not gone over them a second time. Look at Prince Groose making his little
02:32:16 his little glorp, glorp self. Look at look at his little man. Glorp and glorp self.
02:32:25 He's making a little he's making his little boy. He's making his little boy. He's a very cute little boy.
02:32:30 Yeah. It's pretty, pretty cool, pretty cool.
02:32:38 Oh, yeah. And I guess to wrap up what happens in the chapter, Garp appears on a flying ship on
02:32:44 his flying marine galleon with the dog head. And then he does a galaxy fist.
02:32:50 Just blast their fucking town to smithereens. You're so fucking strong. He doesn't even need
02:32:57 to do anything. What do you think is going to happen here, first of all?
02:33:05 Well, I guess it's Garp versus Blackbeard. Yeah. And like, I don't know if Garp is
02:33:12 like every member of the Blackbeard crew that's here. And it's Blackbeard.
02:33:15 Yeah, it's going to be the it's going to be sword, the sword members versus the Blackbeard crew.
02:33:20 Like how else can this go? Well, it's going to be a fight, but like
02:33:25 they're going to break off into a series of one on one engagements. Maybe we maybe we won't see
02:33:31 them. We won't see. I think we'll hear about what happened and it'll be like a big moment.
02:33:35 Like if Garp is dead, that would be a huge moment. I don't think he's going to die,
02:33:40 but he might get defeated. He could die. He could die. Honestly, he could die. Yeah.
02:33:45 But I don't think and this is and this is the main villain of the series that he's going against
02:33:50 and he's doing it to rescue his boy. This is this is when old men die. This is when old
02:33:55 men die in one piece. It's when they stand up for their boys. And this is the thing.
02:34:00 Blackbeard ship is on its way to Egghead. So presuming that this didn't happen that long ago
02:34:06 because Oh, this is the flashback. Yeah. Garp wants to go save. It might not be a flashback,
02:34:11 but I don't know where Blackbeard would be if not here because who's on the ship?
02:34:16 This could be a flashback. I think it might be. But like Garp is doing this. Disobeying orders
02:34:25 to be part of the fleet heading for Egghead. So we know it's happening around the same time.
02:34:30 And if Kobe is here and Garp's here, then either Garp saves Kobe and they leave.
02:34:38 And then for some reason Blackbeard appears at Egghead or Blackbeard is running to Egghead
02:34:45 from Garp or the people on the Blackbeard ship are not who you expect or some other thing.
02:34:55 Whenever we get info on who's on that ship, we'll know what happened here.
02:35:00 Like this is going on now and that ship is just someone else. I mean, the entire crew's not here.
02:35:08 He could have just sent like... I don't remember who the other guys are.
02:35:15 Let me look it up real quick. I made a mistake. The bit where Kobe is kneeling before Blackbeard
02:35:23 is a flashback and currently Kobe is on the island escaping. The bit where he's kneeling before?
02:35:33 Like Blackbeard's there and he's like, haha, fuck you, little boy. Oh, right. When he says I'm sword.
02:35:40 Yeah, I'm a member of sword and it's like, yeah, that. So there's Van Algar, there's Doc.
02:35:47 That could be a flashback within a flashback. It could be. I think the flashbacks are usually
02:35:53 denoted by the background being either gray or black and this is not gray or black. So maybe
02:35:59 you're right and this is currently happening right now. Garp is attacking Blackbeard's island.
02:36:04 Yeah. When Blackbeard is not here and he's actually at Egghead with the rest of his crew.
02:36:09 I think so. Okay, so the crew, so we don't see Lafitte. Avalo Pizarro is this new guy that we
02:36:21 just met. Lafitte, Van Algar, Jesus Burgess, Katarina, Devon and I think that's it. So there's
02:36:29 like a bunch of people that could be on that ship going somewhere else. We know that because we've
02:36:35 seen recently the ship has a brig and in the brig is a, what's her face? Three-Eye Girl
02:36:47 pudding. Pudding is on that ship. She probably still is.
02:36:55 And she was kidnapped putting Sanji's bride from Holcake. She's in there.
02:37:04 Probably hasn't like, because we've seen her in the ship, it's probably safe to assume that
02:37:10 the ship contains her still and she's not here on the island. And that was going on. We saw her
02:37:19 when Blackbeard was fighting Law. So maybe Law could be with pudding in the brig. If he was
02:37:26 defeated, if he wasn't defeated, then he may have escaped. But pudding might be coming to see Sanji
02:37:32 again pretty soon. That sounds very likely. Okay, so apparently Pizarro was from Impel Down.
02:37:41 I forgot we'd seen him before. Yeah, yeah. All of the Blackbeard
02:37:45 additions were from Impel Down. I don't think there's been any others since.
02:37:51 But we haven't seen much of them. This is the first time where I think
02:37:56 even really seeing a conversation with Pizarro and Vasco Schaatt and stuff.
02:38:00 Yeah, we've just kind of seen them around. Apparently they each command their own
02:38:06 like shit. Their own part of the Blackbeard fleet. Yeah. They're called the Ten Titanic
02:38:12 Captains. Also, okay, okay. So apparently we did see sword before. Here's like an old panel of
02:38:22 and it's several of the several of the same people. Oh, yes. Okay, apparently they were in
02:38:32 they were mentioned in chapter 498 and also in 956. I think this panel is probably from 956.
02:38:41 So yeah, that hat guy.
02:38:42 Wait, X Drake might be a member?
02:38:50 I mean, the wiki lists X Drake as an active member of sword. I don't know. Oh, and then,
02:38:55 of course, the three Golems. And then, of course, the three Golems are the most important ones.
02:39:02 Well, I thought 956 wasn't that long ago, but it's like it's
02:39:07 Oh, no, it is it is 100 100 in some chapter. It was it's the reverie. I thought it was like
02:39:13 Fishman Island because I was seeing Fishman Island stuff, but it's Garp having a chat with
02:39:18 Neptune. I forgot about this apparently apparently sword was first mentioned as far back as 498.
02:39:27 You got to be shitting on me. You got to be crunch. You got to be you got to be insane.
02:39:32 That's what it says. How could something have happened before?
02:39:37 I don't I just I just don't know. I don't I can't explain it. The Romanized name is Sodor.
02:39:46 You're welcome. You're welcome for that.
02:39:53 Yeah, there's a I think a bunch of the people are just a bunch of the people pictured here
02:39:59 might just be Golems. I think they are just clay Golems. So they're not real. Don't worry about
02:40:06 them. Oh, yes. Drake is in this chapter nine fifty six. He is a captain of sword and he's talking
02:40:16 to Kobe. Huh? Yeah, I remember Drake talking to Kobe, but I forgot that detail.
02:40:24 I see that. Yeah, that does sound kind of familiar, actually.
02:40:30 Oh, that's right. This is where Kobe talks about. Yeah, he says I'm on my way to the
02:40:34 island of women. Corsi is Corsi is perfect place to be for Kobe. Yeah, to capture the
02:40:41 pirate Empress Boa Hancock because she is no longer she should be okay. Do you like Kobe?
02:40:48 I think I don't like him. I don't like him. I think that they made him too handsome. But aside
02:40:55 from that, I do like him. I think he's he's he's pure of heart and like a nice little boy. I mean
02:41:02 the fact that he has history with Luffy is cool. I think he probably sees him as like a little
02:41:07 brother kind of. I like that. I like that aspect of him. I think I just don't like how he looks.
02:41:12 I don't think he looks cool and they're sort of building him up as like a cool badass and he
02:41:16 just doesn't look cool. Now, Smoker is the cool badass Marine. Everyone agrees. I feel like Smoker
02:41:22 is the one. I feel like a future one. He's the way that like Momonosuke is a future cool guy.
02:41:29 It's he feels a little bit like like right in from Metal Gear Solid 2 where there's like oh,
02:41:33 there's a new like young pretty pretty boy badass in town and he's the super strongest soldier of
02:41:39 all. It's like, no, no, I don't like him. Get him out of here.
02:41:48 My god, this chapter has so much shit happening.
02:41:52 The new one? No, no, no. The one I'm looking back at 956 is I think it's when
02:41:59 at Reverie, they decided that the Shichibukai were no longer
02:42:03 protected by the Marines. And so all of the Shichibukai reacting to that knowledge and like
02:42:14 yeah, Buggy the Clown is like freaking out because he's no longer defending it defended.
02:42:20 So I think this is where he decides to create Cross Guild and then Mihawk is being attacked.
02:42:27 And then here's Edward Weevil, who very briefly was part of the thing.
02:42:33 Is that when we first saw Edward Weevil? No, no, we saw him before. He caused some havoc.
02:42:39 And they said somewhere that he became a warlord, but then they abolished the warlordness.
02:42:47 And now what's her face? Stussy, the real Stussy now that we know her real name
02:42:53 says, yeah, kill them all, kill these Marines and then Boa Hancock. And then Kobe goes to
02:43:01 arrest Boa Hancock, something, something, Black Bear arrives
02:43:07 and captures Kobe. And that's why we're in this situation where Kobe is trying to escape.
02:43:14 And that was 100 chapters ago. Wow. That's so many chapters.
02:43:19 Could you even imagine drawing one chapter of anything? I can't, let alone two.
02:43:28 A little on 1000.
02:43:33 1000 and 80. I can't wait for the 1111 chapter.
02:43:38 Oh, base, dab.
02:43:44 Well, do we have anything else to say about this, this guy?
02:43:49 Still looking forward to seeing what this egghead incident is all about, I guess.
02:43:55 Yes, they're building it up. Everybody's going to be there.
02:43:58 Yeah, I think I think it's probably other other Blackbeard pirates are on the ship and
02:44:04 probably freaking whatever. I've got a wacko prediction. I've got a wacko prediction.
02:44:13 Pudding has the ability to remove memories from a person's head. That's her devil fruit ability.
02:44:20 What if she removes the painful memories from Bonnie's head upon request? I don't want to know
02:44:29 about it anymore. Please just take them out of my brain. Yeah. Pudding's like, okay.
02:44:35 Wait, who was that girl that Sanji had a little fling with in Dressrosa?
02:44:47 Violetta? Violetta. Violetta?
02:44:50 She had a power, right? Yeah, I think her character was really badly handled.
02:44:56 She had the whatever power we needed for this arc power. What did she do?
02:45:04 I think it was something like she could see anyone around. Let me look it up, I can't remember.
02:45:10 Yeah, I'm looking it up. Or Viola. Viola, yeah. We're looking that up on the hero's wiki.
02:45:21 She looks so much better in the manga than the anime. Dressrosa just looked so ugly.
02:45:26 In the anime? Yeah. They stepped it up after Dressrosa, but I remember Dressrosa being so
02:45:32 not good to look at. Appearance, personality, relationships. What's her, just tell me what
02:45:39 her fucking fruit is. A very great fruit. A very great fruit. The Giro know me. Parameshia
02:45:46 allows her to see through solid objects and over vast distances. So she was just used as the,
02:45:51 I know what's happening where and I'm information. This is why I was confusing her with
02:45:56 pudding, because pudding has the third eye. Oh yeah. Yeah, okay. Oh, and then she sees.
02:46:05 She activates her. She can see through Sanji's skin and bones.
02:46:12 She has the power to read other people's minds, even view their memories. She's impossible to
02:46:16 deceive. This power is exceptionally useful for interrogation. Yeah, that's where her job was.
02:46:22 It was this ability to let her see through all the men who attempted to lie to her, but then
02:46:27 Sanji was so pure in his love for women that she was taken aback that he wasn't trying to be evil.
02:46:38 Me, a woman. Oh my God. I can't believe men are all out to deceive me. They're all out to just use
02:46:44 me. Finally, finally, a man who truly down and deep in his heart of hearts loves women. A man who
02:46:51 loves women with uniron. He loves big tits unironically and he will never go trans. Sanji is the
02:47:00 man for me. He's the biggest feminist of all and it's proven by Viola.
02:47:07 It's funny because like it's not.
02:47:14 I don't know if I'm reading too much into it, but it's is it just that like
02:47:21 he did he was he like in love with her or does he just love women?
02:47:26 I forget. I mean, he does. He loves her because he loves women.
02:47:30 Right. He's like I love his love. His love for me is pure. Yes, he would feel the same
02:47:34 towards any other female, but it is nevertheless pure. I think the thing is like
02:47:41 she sees that men are like scoundrels and but even though she betrayed Sanji and caught him
02:47:49 and then got him shot or something, he was bleeding, he protected her because she's so sexy.
02:47:56 Right. And she was like, you do that for me. And then it turns out that she was being oppressed
02:48:01 by the Dressrosa pirate crew anyway. So she didn't actually like being under them.
02:48:07 And she was a big fan of Sanji after that. Viola can gigantic her tears and subsequently
02:48:16 detach and manipulate them using them to pursue her opponents and attack them with blunt force.
02:48:23 Yeah, that I don't get. What the fuck? It's it's a bit odd, but I guess it's sort of like it's a bit
02:48:31 of you know, being over the head with a thing maybe. So Giro Giro, I guess the official English
02:48:38 name is glare glare, but the the meaning of the word is to a glare or a stare. So she and it turns
02:48:46 she's looking. That's her power. It turns. Yes, she is looking. She's a looking to human. No,
02:48:51 she's an insight human or in the Viz translation, an eagle eyed seer.
02:48:58 None of that makes me think that she can make giant tears that will bash you.
02:49:05 I think that was just a part of like, ah, fuck it, whatever. I just want to have like a
02:49:12 let's her do a punch. Like, oh, it was just like, I need her to do like a comedy moment
02:49:17 where she beats the shit out of someone with her own tears. Yeah. It's just like, yeah, she
02:49:22 can do it. Sure. Whatever. I get it. Like, she she awakened. I do feel like there were too many
02:49:31 characters interest for her zone. Viola was unfortunately completely sidelined after whatever
02:49:36 small scenes she had with Sanji. Yeah, then she was just there. And then she disappeared from
02:49:42 relevance forever. Yeah, her power with her. It's sort of like one of those kind of kind of felt
02:49:50 kind of felt like they just kind of did her again, but with pudding.
02:49:54 Yeah, they're very similar. I wonder if it was like an idea that Oda had.
02:50:02 Like putting similarly is like, I know all of your secrets. Yes, similarly is a woman that
02:50:08 betrays him, but decides that she loves him anyway, and also has crazy crazy. She betrays him.
02:50:15 Yes. And and it's like,
02:50:18 like she's never felt someone care about her. Oh my God, men usually abuse me. This is so fucked up.
02:50:25 Oh my God. I love your Sanji. Your love for your love for women. It's a good bit. You know,
02:50:31 you know what? It'll be funny. It'll be funny. It'll be worth it if like the series ends.
02:50:36 And Sanji finds the all blue and then like all the women that he's ever met who have fallen
02:50:41 madly in love with him because his love for women in general is just so pure and unadulterated.
02:50:46 And they're all just waiting for him. They're like, yes, Sanji, we're here for you. No, no more
02:50:51 Isle of Cross Dressers or whatever. You don't have to worry about that anymore. We're here.
02:50:58 We're here. You're safe. Marry us. And then he will. Yes. Yes. Sanji was nice to Kiku.
02:51:09 Which one's Kiku? Kiku is the trans girl in Wano. Born a boy. Yes. Samurai
02:51:19 acts and it presents feminine and everyone just calls her she. He I don't I don't remember.
02:51:26 I don't remember Sanji had anything to say about that. Yeah. I think he said, I don't think
02:51:32 I don't think any of there was no like overt trans like dialogue. No, they just in Wano.
02:51:43 I know that they say they come in the bath like in the in the in the in the gender bath. Yes.
02:51:48 The gender bath and it's like Yamato's in the men's. Was Kiku in there? And Kiku was in the
02:51:55 women's. Yeah. Right. Right. Okay. Well, nobody had a problem with either of that except
02:52:01 all the guys were like, oh my god, Yamato. Sanji had the eyes bugging out because Yamato was there.
02:52:08 Yeah. Bless his heart.
02:52:13 I ain't attracted to gender. I'm attracted to huge boobies. That's what Sanji said.
02:52:17 That's what he said. They asked him about that. You looked to the camera as he said it.
02:52:23 Sanji looked directly at the camera. Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned.
02:52:28 Today I learned about trans rights. Trans rights? What about trans fats? Huh? They're in palm oil.
02:52:37 Oh. I'm going to put them in my, I'm going to put them in my Twizzlers.
02:52:42 Okay. Okay.
02:52:46 Where, where, where, where are we? Oh, you're talking about viola because pudding because
02:52:50 yeah. I think, I think it would viola, viola would be fine with me if there was a moment where viola
02:52:57 came back and pudding was there also and they were fighting over Sanji in a, because they're so
02:53:03 similar. Be like, ah, see. Yeah. A little, a little bit of a moment like that. I want, I want, I want
02:53:09 a big end of the thing. End of the, end of the thing. Uh, just all Sanji's women, they're just like
02:53:17 we're back. We have, we have a, wait, does he, I guess he doesn't really have that many.
02:53:24 No, he has pudding and viola. And I guess like, yeah, there's, there's women who are
02:53:32 indifferent to him. They don't hate him or like him in any specific way, like Kani, the fish,
02:53:38 fish woman. Yeah. And, and like, uh, just people he's friends with, like, um, uh, VV. Yeah.
02:53:49 People he's friends with, that he, you know. He would do his like comedy routine with the
02:53:57 heart eyes in the background, but they wouldn't really react to it. But he's not too pushy about
02:54:02 it. So, you know, we can, we can, we can laugh it off. We can, we can, we can be friends. Um,
02:54:09 unless, uh, but, uh, maybe he'll get more. It's just interesting that like two islands in a row,
02:54:17 they've given Sanji a romance, like a, like a, an actual sort of like falls in love with a girl.
02:54:25 And it wasn't exactly in a row because there was the elephant in between. Oh yeah. Oh yeah,
02:54:28 you're right. But yeah, basically. But they did it, they did it twice. It's weird that it happened
02:54:34 twice. It never, it never used to happen. Um, we're built, we're building to something. We're
02:54:40 building to Sanji Haramark. Sanji is going to become like Andrew Tate. Shave his head. The
02:54:50 ultimate feminist. The ultimate lover of women. There was, um, I remember when the time skip
02:54:58 happened and Sanji had been in the isle of, of, uh, transvestites, the cross-dressing island.
02:55:07 The Okama, right? The Okama. Okama land. Yes. And he had not seen a real woman. Okama,
02:55:13 comma, comma, comma, comma, chameleon. Yes. Because they're disguising themselves as females.
02:55:21 But like, he hadn't seen a beautiful woman in a long time and he had nosebleeds and it was
02:55:30 kind of like he's going to die. He was like, he was lost so much blood. He was so backed up,
02:55:35 he was so backed up from not letting his nose bleed from seeing beautiful women that he was
02:55:40 going, he was backed up, it was clotting, it was going to die. Yeah, I thought he had to release.
02:55:45 I thought that the thing was going to be permanent that Sanji was going to like
02:55:50 every time a Caesar woman bleeds to death. And I'm like, no. Oh, right. This is, this is like,
02:55:55 because negative character development. He knows he's now lethally vulnerable too. Yeah,
02:56:00 it's no longer, oh, he has heart eyes. It's like he has a nosebleed and he has to like
02:56:04 try to deal with it. It's like a brain hemorrhage, yeah. But he did end up like figuring that out.
02:56:09 Good for him. Good. I don't want him to constantly be bleeding. That would be terrible.
02:56:14 I'm happy for him. But like if all of the beautiful women
02:56:21 are all blue and it's like, hi Sanji, would he bleed to death there?
02:56:27 You know, he can just have the two. He can just marry, he can just marry the pudding and viola,
02:56:34 because they're like the same woman anyway. So he can just have both of them.
02:56:38 And that's enough. I think he'll be happy with two. One with each eyebrow. One with each eyebrow.
02:56:44 When my, when his eyebrow is swirling counterclockwise, he's in a viola type
02:56:48 mood. And when his eyebrow is swirling clockwise, he's in a pudding type mood.
02:56:53 That's how you know. You know, Sanji, I mean, he just, he just cooked for them.
02:57:00 He's too much of a gentleman. He would never lay a hand on either of his wives. He would just,
02:57:03 he would just make them delicious roasts, because his true love is the sea.
02:57:09 Yeah, I wonder about all that. Like, is he a virgin? It'd be funny if.
02:57:14 I feel like he's probably, I feel like if I, if I investigate this hard enough,
02:57:19 I think he's probably canonically a virgin. I think they all are, because none of them fuck.
02:57:25 Yeah. I mean, I don't know about Zora. Zora, I feel like could have lost his virginity.
02:57:29 Who would he have fucked? Who? I dare you.
02:57:33 Uh, one of the zombie guerrillas.
02:57:39 Brooke definitely got some.
02:57:41 Brooke? Yeah. I mean, who knows?
02:57:45 Yeah, they gave him a bone or gave him a bone, you know?
02:57:47 Didn't, didn't, I know there's a line he said that like their, their true love is adventure or
02:57:52 whatever. I don't know. The series is pretty chased. I know that there's been occasional
02:57:57 like dick references here and there. I feel like by and large, these characters do not have sex.
02:58:03 Luffy is asexual for sure. Doesn't give a fuck, literally.
02:58:08 Is it just Luffy? Do you think it's just Luffy?
02:58:11 Oh, for Luffy, yeah. I, I, I mean, yeah, Luffy definitely just doesn't
02:58:15 have interest in living or anything. I think Frankie probably would have Robin.
02:58:19 It probably would have been quite dark. She was a runaway girl. She'd probably been raped before.
02:58:24 Oh God. She had to, she had to do, she had to do things. She had to do things to get by.
02:58:29 Yeah. I don't want to think about Nami either. Cause. Oh, right.
02:58:34 She's also kind of a child slave to Arlong. Uh, true.
02:58:38 No, see, this is what I'm saying. I think they just don't, I think these characters just don't
02:58:43 have sex. Like, yeah, I think Frankie would have sex if he were a real person in the real world,
02:58:48 but in, in the world of One Piece, I don't think any of them have sex.
02:58:54 Fair enough. That's.
02:58:57 I just like the idea. I just like the idea of Sanji and Pudding or Viola or both of them,
02:59:03 and they're like coming on to him and he's like, ha, ha, I don't know what to do anymore.
02:59:07 I didn't think. They go to the honeymoon. He's like, um, should I cook something for you?
02:59:15 I swear to God, I swear to God, their honeymoon is just, he's gonna,
02:59:18 he's gonna kiss their little ring fingers and he's gonna, and he's gonna cook fish for them.
02:59:22 And that's their, and that's the honeymoon. And they're gonna be like, come on, Sanji, come to bed.
02:59:27 Come on. Come on. Ah, come on. But he was too much of a gentleman.
02:59:35 Have never to have sex with his wife. Have never to file a woman by touching them.
02:59:40 That's right. That's right.
02:59:43 Um, that's, I think that's the, I think that's the right way to look at it.
02:59:48 Yeah. So Sanji would be waiting on them hand and foot. I guess since they're not, you know,
02:59:53 they'll get with each other, I think. Viola and Pudding.
02:59:57 Yeah, of course. Because that's not, Sanji would be in the chair.
03:00:00 It's not, it's not sex when it's two, when it's two women.
03:00:04 It doesn't count. Of course.
03:00:05 Doesn't count. So, and Sanji would.
03:00:08 That's a good ending.
03:00:09 Sanji would, uh, Sanji would, he would, he would, he would come in, he'd be like,
03:00:14 I'm going to do his like, his old, like a four kids dub voice. He'd be like, hey Viola,
03:00:21 we made a, I made you a nice fish for you at my darling.
03:00:25 And then he'd come in and they'd be making out and he'd just be like, what's this?
03:00:27 This is so silly. What are you, what are you, what's, what is, what is this?
03:00:31 Practical joke. What are you doing? That's so funny. All right.
03:00:35 You kids have, you kids have fun now.
03:00:38 Um, you just, there's, there's a, there's a funny, there's a video by Lily
03:00:43 Alexander about, uh, the, I might have mentioned this. I've stopped me if I mentioned this.
03:00:49 It's about the first filmed kiss. The first filmed kiss.
03:00:55 They, like, there is a movie that's like, consider the first kiss and it's between,
03:00:59 there's an actor and an actress and they, they banter and then they kiss each other.
03:01:04 And that one's kind of famous, but there's actually another one before that that's actually
03:01:10 two naked women kissing each other. And you'd think that that one would have been like really
03:01:17 scandalous, that that was like put to film, but it's not because reason one is that it was more
03:01:24 of like, it was like an art reference. It was a piece of like art reference footage for artists
03:01:29 to copy when they were drawing. It wasn't like, you know, disseminated as like a, a cultural
03:01:36 thing. Why were all these artists drawing the scandalous woman on woman kiss? And the other
03:01:41 thing, and that's, that's why they were naked is because it was supposed to be like an anatomical
03:01:44 study, but also it just wasn't seen as sexual at all because women did not have sexual desires.
03:01:54 They were just, too women kissing is just, that's just a silly, that's just a silly ridiculous
03:02:01 girl. Just do that. They just like doing that. They just, if they do it, it's not because
03:02:06 they like it or they even thinking about anything at all. It's just a funny, like it's like a,
03:02:11 it's just really funny. It's like, if like, it's like, if like a giraffe we're wearing like a top
03:02:16 hat, it's like, why is it doing that? That's so silly. Yeah, like literally though, it was just
03:02:25 a funny goof and nobody even thought about it. Like it's like two girls can't kiss that might
03:02:30 overturn the societal norms. All the, all the historical lesbians just sort of side eyeing
03:02:36 each other like, yeah, just like a giraffe with a hat. Such a funny goof. It was exactly like that.
03:02:44 They would play that up. They would play that up so they couldn't, wouldn't get attacked and killed
03:02:47 by the anti-woke brigade. That's what I would have done. I think that's probably how I would handle it.
03:02:55 Wait, do you like doing that?
03:02:58 Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is so, this is so fucked.
03:03:06 I think we're done talking about the chapter. Yes. And I've got to pee again, tragically.
03:03:12 So I'll be right back. Tragic.
03:03:15 Okay, sorry, I'm back. Let's, shall we do voicemails?
03:03:25 Before that, I wanted to talk about this little spreadsheet.
03:03:30 What's this?
03:03:32 I will screen grab it. For purposes of drawing my comic, Clarissa Gunsmoke
03:03:40 and The Bandit King, I have taken to keeping track of things to like to think,
03:03:50 put numbers to my progress. And I've, it's a very small little spreadsheet, but I just,
03:03:57 I just really like it. It's just really cute. And it basically tracks my pages per hour and my
03:04:03 average pages per hour for line art and shading slash finishing touches, finalizing of a page.
03:04:13 So I have a week and sometimes I don't do anything for a day. It's like whatever.
03:04:17 As you can see, my most recent week, I've been not doing much and I've been
03:04:23 ratcheting up the amount of time I'm spending. I'm going to try and aim for like a six hour day.
03:04:28 And that's, that's, I'm just going to keep going a bit more every day until I can, you know,
03:04:34 reliably do it. And then at the top right, my PPH, my pages per hour, I can, I can see.
03:04:44 And I put all the little code in, so it like makes all the numbers correctly. And it's very
03:04:51 simple. And it's nice. My, um, my numbers for Beescapades would be really bad on these.
03:05:01 I take, I feel like my time per page is like really awful, especially considering that like
03:05:09 there's not that much drawing involved. And yet it's, they still just take me forever.
03:05:16 And I hate it.
03:05:17 Is it because you keep like changing bits?
03:05:21 Yeah, it's because I keep like, like drawing and redrawing bits.
03:05:23 It's not drawing and redrawing so much as it is like fiddling around with like how big to make a
03:05:28 panel or like where to position it or like whether it should go in the left or the right or
03:05:34 or how or where to crop it or something like that. And there's a lot of like switching tabs
03:05:39 because I'll switch from like the, I'll use the original art, the original panel, and then I'll
03:05:43 put it on the page and then I'll resize and then I'll move it and I'll just change my mind
03:05:48 about how big it to be. And it's just very, uh, it's very like at any step of those process,
03:05:55 there's a risk that I might lose focus and like get distracted and decide like, I'm gonna like,
03:06:00 let me look at YouTube for a second. Let me look at Twitter for a second.
03:06:03 Oh yeah. That's no good.
03:06:05 It is. It is no good. So, you know, I had,
03:06:07 I mean, it happens to me as well, but like I just try to not, I try to
03:06:11 rein myself in when I notice I'm doing it.
03:06:13 I try, I tried to change, uh, the workflow so that like I just like size the entire page down
03:06:19 so that I could just draw the panels directly onto the page and then size the page up. And it,
03:06:26 it didn't really work because like, uh, the text did not scale correctly. Like I had to like read,
03:06:33 I had to like redo all of the, the text and that was very annoying because I
03:06:40 think that would have smoothed out my workflow a bit and it like
03:06:44 ended up introducing like more steps and where I had to like correct everything.
03:06:48 I should say that this is a very recently made spreadsheet.
03:06:52 This is good. This is good information to track like how many hours you're working per day
03:06:57 and how long it takes you to finish a page and how long for your line. Like this is good,
03:07:01 good stuff to know. Yeah. But it does not include, uh, the hours that went into all of the sketches
03:07:07 for all these pages, which involves all of that mental labor of like
03:07:11 thinking what size a pile should be, what shape it should be,
03:07:15 potentially what sort of things should be on this page. That does take a long time just thinking
03:07:21 about it and like trying stuff out. Usually the hardest part and sometimes the one that like
03:07:25 gets you completely stuck and like you can't even finish it. So if I were to, I do want to
03:07:32 continue this spreadsheet just because over time the average will be more accurate to like an actual
03:07:38 average of my like speed at drawing line art or shading. And I'm going to do a third one for
03:07:45 sketching and like blocking out a page because they're all different skills, but they're all
03:07:52 important to track, but not together because like I don't draw a page from start to finish
03:07:59 in one go. I like draw the chapters pages in sketch form and then go do the line art.
03:08:06 Yeah. Because I feel like it's easier to think how to plan pages out when they're all like
03:08:13 vague. And I'm like, oh, actually this page would be better if it starts with a different
03:08:18 panel. So I need to move panels around. And that means the previous page has to be different.
03:08:23 And if it's already line art, then it's like a whole lot of bunch of work. But if it's
03:08:28 if it's still sketch, then I can easily resketch. So yeah, that don't feel too bad about having to
03:08:37 think about where the panels go because that is a lot of of it's more work than you would imagine
03:08:44 it takes. I want to I want to try and I want to try and cut down on it in some way. I think maybe
03:08:51 maybe there's maybe there's some work around to the text size issue because it's really I mean
03:08:57 you could just you could just like what I do with just just just some decisions I could make ahead
03:09:03 of time to just kind of standardize it a little bit to leave less room for me to like fiddle
03:09:07 because fiddling I spent I can spend a lot of time fiddling on like pretty pointless stuff
03:09:13 if I let myself I mean what I would do if I'm sketching a page blocking it out I would draw
03:09:21 like the very basics of what character is there so I could look back at it and be like oh yeah
03:09:26 it's that character and if they have a speech bubble where it's going but you've you've got text
03:09:32 like underneath I think you don't need to like type it out just put like I'm gonna put some text
03:09:38 here and then the next panel be here and then you fill in the text later after you've decided
03:09:44 where the panels go yeah because you can always change the text size to fit if you know if it's
03:09:50 not enough space I mean I'm sure you'll you'll you'll you have plenty of space on like an A4
03:09:56 or whatever size sheet and the panels are not like filling it up in the same way a traditional
03:10:01 comic word yeah yeah yeah it's just it's just a workflow it's got a just a the just got a nail
03:10:13 down and a more optimal format and workflow in a way that makes pages go a little bit smoother
03:10:21 because they don't they're not coming out smoothly right now but it just takes a refining
03:10:27 refinement the sort of thing that this spreadsheet is really quite motivating for me because like
03:10:34 I have a good day or like next Monday this coming Monday tomorrow I'm gonna be like all right I'm
03:10:40 gonna try and work for more than I did last time so four and a half hours see how I do
03:10:46 once I've done that my goal for the day is done but then I get to put the numbers in so I work
03:10:52 for this amount of time and how many pages got finished in that time and you know I put the
03:10:58 numbers in the little thing goes up or down like is my is my average improving I think it should be
03:11:03 because last week I was very slow I was just sort of slowly starting to get things rolling again
03:11:14 eventually you'll have a time when you put the numbers in and average goes down and that's
03:11:19 inevitable true so don't be too tripped up when that I I will try not to I'm sure I'll feel a
03:11:29 little bad when like oh I had a bad week sure but I think that the longer I agree the longer I record
03:11:37 the data for this the more the less the average will shift like the first week that I recorded
03:11:45 there for line art was very productive just so happened to be because it was the end of a bunch
03:11:50 of other weeks of me drawing the previous chapter so I was really going going at it working quite
03:11:57 hard getting a lot of stuff done my pages per hour was like half a page an hour but now it's like
03:12:05 a third of a page an hour and I like it's gone down but like it's more accurate and so the longer
03:12:12 I go it'll become more accurate and so I won't it won't go up for like it won't go up or down
03:12:17 that much yeah each time it'll settle into a yeah an average yeah and after I finish with Clarissa
03:12:26 I'll be like the average line art for that I can pretty accurately say that's that's generally how
03:12:34 fast I can do something and then I can plan like if I do something on the level of Clarissa
03:12:40 how long is it going to take and I have a number that I can pretty accurately say
03:12:44 that's a good benchmark that's a good benchmark I can use to to count how many hours it's going to
03:12:48 take and then I can see on this as well how many hours I'm likely to be able to do per day before
03:12:54 I get too tired I want to aim for like six hours last last time I was doing really good that's pretty
03:13:02 is very respectable yeah last time I was trying my goal was five hours and I did do that for
03:13:10 like a number of days in a row so I think that's pretty doable honestly like six hours of like
03:13:14 focused work a day is like kind of a lot like it's hard that's a pay I mean
03:13:22 to do that like it is it is five days a week every week that's like a lot
03:13:26 yeah but you gotta put it in I mean we're we're not like competing with uh mangaka but like
03:13:36 they probably work yeah like 12 hours a day every day without weekends for the amount of work that
03:13:42 they get a lot a lot they get done yeah a lot of them probably do yeah obviously the workflows are
03:13:46 going to be different it's not like there's a set schedule but like I would like to be able
03:13:53 to say to myself I am capable of doing uh respectable amount of work per day how much
03:14:01 how much would it how much would it cost to pay a guy to do my
03:14:05 inks and my finishing and my lettering how much would I have to I have no idea
03:14:12 you can check rights people do that sort of thing yeah maybe on the fiver maybe on fiver
03:14:20 sometimes I've thought about sometimes I thought about hiring an assistant but like
03:14:25 for that to be worth it I would have to be making a lot of pages like if I was in the midst of a
03:14:29 big project and I was chump turning out pages I might think like I should hire an assistant
03:14:34 stupid to think about that when I'm like not actively pumping out stuff I don't know
03:14:41 know yeah it's easy to get discouraged for me at least when I was like I don't know
03:14:50 I see people working I just think they're working so much harder than me
03:14:54 therefore I don't deserve uh success yeah I'm like well actually you can just do whatever you can
03:15:05 do and shut up I mean people that are pumping out a lot of stuff yeah they usually have a team
03:15:15 behind them supporting them in some in some way or a lot a lot of times they do so a lot of
03:15:21 uns there's a lot of unseen work that goes into like many things yeah I mean for people who do
03:15:31 uh fan translations there's a lot of steps it's not just you read it you translate it and you
03:15:38 put the letters in you gotta you gotta erase all of the things already there you gotta type
03:15:48 everything up and you gotta make it look in the right font in the right space in the inside the balloon
03:15:54 and that's just translating actually drawing it in the first place that's just translate
03:16:02 uh you gotta have proof readers and like the double checkers too hard as a team no thanks
03:16:13 no thanks I just won't I'll just wing it
03:16:16 just don't just do it the easy way I'll just wing it for I can't think I can't think of a
03:16:27 thing that rhymes with wing bing the search engine I'll I'll wing it for a bing it
03:16:36 yeah thanks for listening to the progress this podcast do you want do you want to go
03:16:43 I just want to end my stupid thought and it's over now uh so let's go to questions let's go to
03:16:49 voicemails uh okay patreon.com slash the procrastinators uh to send a voicemail I guess uh there's
03:16:57 something um speak pipe speak pipe uh please okay there's not okay it's a it's a reasonable
03:17:07 it's a reasonable amount of voicemails thank god the first one I see is called a purposeless
03:17:13 searching husk are you ready mm-hmm okay three two one go
03:17:19 pen look through the pictures on your mobile device find the ones where you made your hair
03:17:28 look as bad as possible and post them if you are not craving I am craving I must see them
03:17:39 no so that I can discover a new purpose for myself no die die no purpose wait until November
03:17:49 and then you can find that purpose yeah yeah yeah November then if you still need a purpose maybe
03:17:54 then we'll talk uh I haven't even posted any pictures of my shaved head look even though
03:17:59 it looks good and fine not because I'm embarrassed well yes because I'm embarrassed but not because
03:18:07 I'm like oh it looks bad just because I'm like I don't want anyone to see me I don't want people
03:18:11 to see me posting of myself and that goes doubly for like uh uh I don't want people to think I
03:18:18 thought I looked okay to be posted online yeah definitely not definitely not yeah I look okay
03:18:24 but if I don't look like my best then I might as well look my worst I gotta wear a tuxedo if I'm
03:18:30 gonna appear online you got to wear the hijab to be to be decent uh next one is called heavy heavy
03:18:37 three two one go nothing happy birthday Ben what is it's waiting on you said happy birthday Ben
03:18:49 oh it was my birthday uh thank you my happy birthday when was your birthday it was uh

03:19:03 fridays ago two fridays ago oh it's been a while sorry I missed it
03:19:11 whatever everyone else everyone else did too so it's fine no I like deliberately didn't say anything
03:19:16 about it um uh you know who else's birthday it was endless war we have almost the same birthday
03:19:24 endless the endless war anniversary is uh April 9th so it was a five-year anniversary oh my god yeah
03:19:33 if you can believe that endless war so old that yeah it's cracking it needs it needs a repair it
03:19:39 needs a refurbishment it's actually it's actually kind of bizarre it's bizarre to me to think back to
03:19:45 when I made when we well you know I didn't make it by myself but when we made it
03:19:49 and think that it's been five years since then that's that's strange that's weird to me it feels
03:19:57 like it's been around for a while but like when you put a number like five years it feels it feels
03:20:02 like two maybe three years but no I mean there's one thing that always trips me up and it's the
03:20:11 fact that 2021 was a whole year and not like a month oh yeah yeah like 2020 and 2021 feel like the
03:20:20 same year yeah they do yeah they do yeah that whole thing that whole thing I think contributes to the
03:20:30 feeling of like nothing happened well I mean things happened but like you know what I mean
03:20:38 yeah it's odd yeah it's a very odd like alien feeling I never been through a single pandemic
03:20:44 before that one yes well it won't be the last uh next oh boy we got it we got it we got you think
03:20:51 you thought that one was good just wait until you hear what we got cooking uh next one is called
03:20:57 death note 3 2 1 go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa L dies uh you spoiled death note for me sorry
03:21:11 should've watched it's stupid uh just so you know
03:21:17 um uh l uh took an out
03:21:23 That's the biggest alley ever took me.
03:21:26 It was kind of an out, but he did it.
03:21:28 He got the he did get the W in the end.
03:21:30 He got the W in the end.
03:21:32 You think I don't think W's count from beyond the grave.
03:21:34 I don't think God accepts W's.
03:21:38 Shit.
03:21:39 They don't get past the kingdom of the gates of heaven.
03:21:42 They don't get past those pearly gates.
03:21:43 I have them with little spears.
03:21:45 There's no L's or W's in the Bible, actually.
03:21:50 Oh, next one is called Delving into Gibbons Psyche.
03:21:54 Three, two, one, go.
03:21:55 Are you like a Gibbons Psyche?
03:21:58 I was going to say, we're going to talk a lot about Gibbon right now.
03:22:00 Are you sexually into like, like, are you a masochist?
03:22:05 Or do you just think it's funny?
03:22:06 I think it's funny.
03:22:07 I don't actually know whether I'm into that.
03:22:09 I just thought it was because like, I'm who's that?
03:22:12 Because like all that they all represent like something that I want to be.
03:22:15 I want to be a little confident and cool.
03:22:18 And also women.
03:22:20 Wait, what was that last?
03:22:21 I missed that last.
03:22:22 They're also women.
03:22:23 They're also women.
03:22:24 Are you talking about your waifus in this one?
03:22:27 Yeah, I think I was probably talking about Risco and Marcelline.
03:22:29 Episode two.
03:22:30 Episode two of the Procrastiners podcast.
03:22:35 Delving into Gibbons Psyche.
03:22:37 I mean, true.
03:22:38 Your voice is so much like Therodier.
03:22:41 You have like a deeper Therodier version of yourself.
03:22:44 Yeah.
03:22:45 I guess I don't know if that's the right way to describe it,
03:22:47 but like it's it's it's mess.
03:22:50 Presenting, I guess it's one of those weird things
03:22:53 because I don't feel like I was ever putting on a voice.
03:22:56 No, but now that I talk like more just naturally
03:23:00 how I feel like it's okay to talk.
03:23:02 I wouldn't have talked like this back then because it's like,
03:23:05 oh, that's a high pitched sort of weird girly voice.
03:23:08 I mean, I but I wasn't like trying to do like a deeper voice.
03:23:13 I don't know.
03:23:13 I sound different now than I did back then as well.
03:23:17 And I don't really know why that is.
03:23:19 I never I never attempted to put on a voice.
03:23:22 I don't know if I just sound different now
03:23:24 or if I just have changed my cadence or something.
03:23:28 I think it comes with honestly, it comes with like,
03:23:33 I presume merely talking a lot.
03:23:36 Yeah, because we are on a podcast.
03:23:37 We talk a lot, maybe more than normal people talk, maybe.
03:23:42 Like obviously you talk with friends, but like a lot of dialogue is through text.
03:23:48 Yeah.
03:23:49 And so you might not talk that much.
03:23:50 We talk quite a lot, especially if you're a YouTuber, you talk a hell of a lot.
03:23:55 But like, I don't know why sometimes a voice goes up in pitch
03:23:59 and for other people it goes down.
03:24:01 I noticed and I think Aaron Hansen from Game Grumps did say
03:24:06 that talking so much on Game Grumps has made his voice deepen quite considerably.
03:24:11 That's interesting.
03:24:12 And I'm like, wow, what?
03:24:14 Huh?
03:24:15 I don't know anything about that.
03:24:18 Strange.
03:24:21 Okay, next.
03:24:21 Also, I sound more British and I don't like that.
03:24:23 You used to?
03:24:25 I did used to.
03:24:26 Well, I don't know.
03:24:27 I can't hear my voice right now, so I don't know.
03:24:30 Next one is an image.
03:24:33 Let's look at it.
03:24:34 Then, Saint, I'm going to put my dick into a blender.
03:24:38 Food and Drug Administration.
03:24:40 Sarah, please don't do that.
03:24:41 Thousands of Americans have suffered blender-related injuries to their genitals
03:24:45 as April alone.
03:24:46 Nice concern trolling Nazi blocked.
03:24:51 That's how it goes.
03:24:52 What can I say but true?
03:24:54 What can I say but I'll put my dick in a blender?
03:24:56 They're not telling me that for my own safety.
03:24:58 They're telling me that because they're trying to control me.
03:25:01 They're trying to gaslight me.
03:25:03 They're trying to get some good PR.
03:25:04 Want to put my-
03:25:05 Oh, we're the company that told somebody not to put the dick in a blender.
03:25:08 I'll buy that blender.
03:25:09 Dick in a blender.
03:25:13 Next one is another image.
03:25:15 Let's go.
03:25:19 Yeah.
03:25:20 I paused my Procrastinator's podcast.
03:25:25 Episode three, whatever, to be here.
03:25:29 This better be good.
03:25:32 Do you-
03:25:33 Well, my little pony tattoo on their arm?
03:25:37 Yes.
03:25:39 Trans belt buckle.
03:25:40 Why did they have to pause?
03:25:44 I don't get it.
03:25:44 No, the idea is that it's like a cringe like gamer shirt.
03:25:48 I paused my video game to be here.
03:25:49 This better be good.
03:25:51 Like, I don't like social interaction, but they replaced it with a Procrastinator's.
03:25:54 This is just a caricature.
03:25:55 This is just a cruel caricature of your typical PCD fan.
03:25:59 Yeah.
03:26:00 Yeah.
03:26:01 Why they hold in their can of soda like that?
03:26:03 It's going to fall out.
03:26:03 This guy hates our audience even more than I do.
03:26:07 Can you imagine that?
03:26:10 Speaking of which, the next one is called Imagine Playing That.
03:26:14 Three, two, one, go.
03:26:17 I don't know anything about Fire Emblem, but I like them in this mesh.
03:26:24 Is Ike cool?
03:26:26 What do you think, Gibbs?
03:26:27 Is Ike cool?
03:26:28 Ike is-
03:26:31 He's unlike a lot of Fire Emblem protagonists because he's not a noble, rich son of a Lord
03:26:38 or a king or a prince or a princess who is destined to wield the super sword and save the universe.
03:26:45 He's a mercenary who rallies his people against the evil kingdom.
03:26:50 And in that way, he is very based.
03:26:52 That's pretty cool.
03:26:53 I like him.
03:26:54 He's a down-to-earth kind of boy.
03:26:58 Neat.
03:26:59 He also does save the world, but like-
03:27:01 Sure.
03:27:02 It is, you know, whatever.
03:27:03 Yeah, yeah.
03:27:04 There's always a magical demon or something.
03:27:07 There's always a demon.
03:27:09 The next one is-
03:27:10 There's an image.
03:27:14 No, I never watched the Procrastinators podcast.
03:27:17 What the fuck is that?
03:27:21 It's just a big bunch of trash.
03:27:23 Yeah, there's no- there's no tunnel.
03:27:25 There's no tunnel.
03:27:26 It's just- he's just a guy walking away with his pickets.
03:27:29 Just walking away from some trash.
03:27:34 Why did he get so close to the trash with the pickets?
03:27:36 Yeah, I would have avoided it.
03:27:37 What an idiot.
03:27:38 I would have avoided it much further than that.
03:27:41 He was playing with fire.
03:27:46 He's so despondent.
03:27:47 He came- he thought it was a mountain that he could get diamonds from,
03:27:50 but oh no, it's just a bunch of trash.
03:27:56 Next one is tiny-
03:28:00 It's another image.
03:28:01 Tiny URL.
03:28:03 It says URL shortener.
03:28:05 Oh, um-
03:28:06 I do not know-
03:28:07 What the hell is this?
03:28:09 Free anime girls and a spider coming through a door.
03:28:12 Some abstract-
03:28:13 There's a Rubik's Cube with like an intestine.
03:28:18 I don't think this is related to anything.
03:28:20 No.
03:28:21 Looks-
03:28:23 Neat.
03:28:23 It's pretty cool, I guess.
03:28:24 Uh, next one is called porn, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:28:29 What do you watch more?
03:28:30 Cartoon porn or human porn?
03:28:33 I would have to say-
03:28:37 What do you watch more?
03:28:38 In terms of videos, it would definitely be human.
03:28:41 Yeah, human.
03:28:42 Definitely human.
03:28:43 Like animated hentai stuff is sort of disgusting.
03:28:46 Yeah, animated is bad.
03:28:48 Cartoon- I read a manga.
03:28:50 A lot of the porn I consume is in manga form.
03:28:54 So that's not- but that's not animated.
03:28:56 That's not a cartoon.
03:28:57 Illustrations.
03:28:59 Yeah, when it's animated, it looks comic books.
03:29:04 I never like it when it's moving.
03:29:07 No, stop moving.
03:29:08 I am the one who turns the page, not you.
03:29:11 Yes, yes.
03:29:13 Next one is called this you, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:29:18 Eleazar.
03:29:20 Eleazar does have a voicemail.
03:29:24 Eleazar turns-
03:29:29 Yes.
03:29:30 You- I couldn't hear what you said through your tears.
03:29:32 I think you said cut that voicemail, cut that voicemail.
03:29:36 What, the porn one or?
03:29:38 I don't know.
03:29:39 I don't know.
03:29:40 Just any old voicemail.
03:29:42 I guess we should cut all of them to-
03:29:43 Maybe I cut a voicemail last time.
03:29:46 I don't remember.
03:29:49 To you, it was the day I cut your voicemail.
03:29:51 To me, it was Tuesday.
03:29:53 I don't actually cut very many.
03:29:56 Next one is called Funny Voicemail Idea, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:30:01 So, I had an idea for a voicemail, but I'm too lazy to open up Sony Vegas and make it.
03:30:08 Nice, nice.
03:30:09 So, okay.
03:30:10 Here's what we did.
03:30:11 So, that guy who left that Chad vs. Virgin, Chad vs. Virgin, Jesse, Ben St.
03:30:19 Fanart, if you can call it that.
03:30:22 Okay, so I was thinking.
03:30:24 So, in that situation, Ben is Batman.
03:30:29 And the other guy who sent in the picture is the Joker.
03:30:35 And then when Ben said that one thing where he said,
03:30:39 this guy genuinely hates me.
03:30:41 He genuinely hates me.
03:30:43 Then I would like cut to the Joker saying,
03:30:46 oh, what would I do without you, Batman?
03:30:49 I need you, Ben St.
03:30:51 I need you.
03:30:53 You complete me, Ben St.
03:30:55 That's, I think that would be pretty, be pretty funny.
03:31:01 You know what?
03:31:01 Yeah, good idea.
03:31:03 Maybe.
03:31:06 You know, it's a more fun way to look at it, I think.
03:31:10 You complete me, Ben St.
03:31:12 You complete me, Ben St.
03:31:13 Oh, yeah, Dustin to do this forever.
03:31:17 This dance.
03:31:20 Okay, then next one is just called She-Her.
03:31:24 Three, two, one, go.
03:31:26 It's currently half 11 on Friday.
03:31:28 Where's the new video?
03:31:30 Shut up.
03:31:31 Shut the hell up.
03:31:32 Fuck you, entitled fan.
03:31:34 Fuck yourself.
03:31:35 You're lucky you get any podcasts at all.
03:31:37 You don't deserve it.
03:31:41 We were too busy eating chocolate eggs.
03:31:43 It was Easter.
03:31:44 Yeah, I had to get my black strapped molasses.
03:31:49 I was eating a chocolate crunchy bar egg.
03:31:52 I ate some and and curling up in the sunlight.
03:31:56 And that's my Sunday.
03:31:57 I eat some.
03:31:57 I eat some coffee groups, some coffee chocolate granola.
03:32:03 Snacks, snacks.
03:32:05 The next one is an image.
03:32:09 Let's look at it.
03:32:12 There it is.
03:32:15 Okay, I like this.
03:32:18 Is these these images at the bottom are very funny.
03:32:21 I have enlisted GPT Sasha cyberbullying, but it came out too savage.
03:32:26 If you're fragile, liberal feelings are hurt.
03:32:30 Feel free to skip this entire voicemail, Saint.
03:32:35 Who want you read yours for us?
03:32:37 Yeah.
03:32:40 Wait, is this a is this a rap?
03:32:44 Oh, Ben St.
03:32:45 The podcaster and Twitch streamer, the one known for his shitty
03:32:48 Blu-rays and demeanor.
03:32:50 He lounges all day.
03:32:51 A lazy man indeed sitting around stuffing his face with keto feed.
03:32:56 A socialist, he proudly claims Twitter feeds his constant
03:32:59 flames, but his work ethics rather lame compared to Nate.
03:33:03 He's such a shame.
03:33:04 While Ben tweets chat, GBT knows so much.
03:33:07 I don't know.
03:33:08 While Ben tweets, Nate earns his bread.
03:33:10 He works hard while Ben lies in bed.
03:33:12 Ben's comics.
03:33:13 They're always late.
03:33:15 Nate's success.
03:33:16 He does create.
03:33:17 Oh, Ben tried to paint his teeth for the glowing pain, thinking
03:33:21 it'd make him cool.
03:33:22 But oh, what a quaint idea he had.
03:33:25 Okay.
03:33:25 Okay.
03:33:26 Idea he had for it made him look strange.
03:33:28 And now he is seen as simply deranged.
03:33:32 This is like a doctor's.
03:33:33 I mean, I know it's the eye.
03:33:35 Is this in the style of Dr.
03:33:36 Zeus?
03:33:38 I think that the quaint.
03:33:40 Strange, deranged.
03:33:41 Like that seems like a sort of thing you would say about like a
03:33:44 villain in a in a Dr.
03:33:46 Zeus.
03:33:48 So Ben St.
03:33:49 The man of many quirks is nothing but a lazy all day jerk with
03:33:52 shitty blue rays and gummy worm snacks.
03:33:55 He won't go anywhere.
03:33:56 That's just the facts.
03:33:58 I could see that.
03:33:59 It's over.
03:34:04 I saw malt gummy.
03:34:06 Delicious.
03:34:06 Delicious.
03:34:09 Oh, give and take.
03:34:10 What a name to bear.
03:34:11 An artist who couldn't even draw a square.
03:34:13 Oh, gotcha.
03:34:14 Oh, no.
03:34:15 By your ass.
03:34:15 Attended attended animation school to learn but ended up with
03:34:19 art that made us yearn.
03:34:20 Hmm.
03:34:22 Doesn't sound so bad.
03:34:23 Yeah, yearn for a better.
03:34:26 Society will learn yearn for better art.
03:34:29 Yeah, I think that's what it's going for.
03:34:32 Your Minecraft castle is your claim to fame.
03:34:35 But who cares?
03:34:36 It's just a virtual.
03:34:37 It's not even real.
03:34:40 Not even real.
03:34:41 No, it's real to me.
03:34:43 You call yourself.
03:34:45 Your Minecraft castle.
03:34:46 It's only in a video game.
03:34:47 Give it's only in a video game.
03:34:51 Some people have real castles.
03:34:53 Nate Nate has a real castle.
03:34:55 What do you have been?
03:34:58 You call yourself a big mommy milker obsessed with enemy boobs.
03:35:02 What a thriller.
03:35:03 That sucks.
03:35:04 Yeah, that's not even this one.
03:35:05 That's not even that's not a bird.
03:35:07 The first one was a little questionable.
03:35:08 This one's this one's these rhymes are.
03:35:11 We got a movie.
03:35:12 There's no less about you got a good one.
03:35:13 Your presence your presence on YouTube quite obscure.
03:35:16 It leaves us questioning.
03:35:17 What is it for?
03:35:18 What is it for?
03:35:19 What is it for?
03:35:21 Your failed attempts at being a comic artist makes us wonder if you're even an artist.
03:35:27 Yeah, this is really bad.
03:35:28 This is not like really bad words.
03:35:31 They seem to elude a vocabulary so small.
03:35:34 Perhaps give and take shouldn't talk at all.
03:35:36 I like that.
03:35:36 That's pretty good.
03:35:37 I like that one.
03:35:37 That one sounds.
03:35:38 Oh, no, my vocabulary so small.
03:35:41 So meager miniscule.
03:35:44 So give and take strive to be better.
03:35:46 Learn from major true trendsetter for art is a craft to be honed with time.
03:35:51 Not thrown together like a nursery rhyme.
03:35:53 Is that a self burn from the self burn from chat?
03:35:57 G.B.T.
03:35:58 Gibsters.
03:36:00 We're finished.
03:36:01 Gib sisters were finished.
03:36:02 Go upstairs.
03:36:03 Give sisters.
03:36:05 I'm holding my published book though.
03:36:08 I'm on my I'm always on that grand.
03:36:11 It's better than your than your book.
03:36:14 You can't even eat that book.
03:36:17 Yeah, but you can't read that gummy.
03:36:21 You can read it because it has words on it actually.
03:36:23 So it's clearly clearly labeled.
03:36:26 My word counts bigger than your gummy could ever imagine.
03:36:30 It's called concise concise storytelling.
03:36:34 My gummy gets in gets out tells y'all you need to know.
03:36:38 Pretty funny.
03:36:39 I pretty good.
03:36:40 Pretty good.
03:36:41 Pretty good.
03:36:43 La Mal.
03:36:45 Okay, we got another one.
03:36:48 It's an image.

03:36:53 Go help your mother with the grocery bags.

03:37:19 Hilary on that would be a very strange name for a child.
03:37:26 Dad, Dad, can I be on your podcast this week?
03:37:29 Fuck you, son.
03:37:30 Elon Musk is the reason why actually.
03:37:35 Yeah, this is this is this is how Nate this is how Nate sees it going down, I think.
03:37:41 Time will tell.
03:37:43 I wonder how many Soros are in the world.
03:37:46 Because of King.
03:37:47 I think there's got to be some.
03:37:48 I think there's definitely some.
03:37:50 Yeah.
03:37:52 Here's a better question.
03:37:54 Well.
03:37:56 I wonder, I mean, is that a thing that people are like normally named in Japan?
03:38:02 Probably.
03:38:02 So, okay, I guess it's not.
03:38:04 It wouldn't be that weird then if someone named their kids, Sora, because in Japan,
03:38:09 but in English, it would be a bit weird.
03:38:11 So yeah, only the English ones.
03:38:13 I bet I bet there's some.
03:38:16 Category.
03:38:19 Okay, next one is called Timmy.
03:38:21 Three, two, one, go.
03:38:26 Wedgie, wedgie mommy wedgie.
03:38:31 Wedgie wedgie.
03:38:35 I'm such a fucking nerd.
03:38:41 Wedgie wedgie.
03:38:44 The PCP characters are getting worse and worse.
03:38:48 We used to be a proper country.
03:38:50 Wedgie wedgie wedgie.
03:38:58 Mama.
03:39:01 What the fuck is the point of this?
03:39:02 What's the joke?
03:39:04 That sucks.
03:39:05 That sucks.
03:39:06 I'm sorry.
03:39:08 Give me a break.
03:39:09 Give me a freaking break.
03:39:11 Give me a freaking break over here.
03:39:14 Next one is we got another image.
03:39:17 Oh, my God.
03:39:18 Let's freaking go.
03:39:19 Oh, God.
03:39:20 More.
03:39:22 That's more of this.
03:39:22 More of this.
03:39:23 These faces.
03:39:25 Procrastinators podcast.
03:39:27 Oh, it's more.
03:39:28 Okay, good.
03:39:29 Welcome back to us.
03:39:30 This is the podcast.
03:39:31 Welcome back to the podcast, folks.
03:39:33 Today, Ben and I are here to announce our latest and greatest project,
03:39:36 Perfect Comic Party.
03:39:39 That's right, Gib.
03:39:39 This is going to be the best online comic platform out there.
03:39:43 People can submit their own comics and get published alongside our own masterpieces,
03:39:47 Clarissa Gunsmoke and Biscopades.
03:39:51 Absolutely.
03:39:51 This is exactly how we talk.
03:39:54 I agree.
03:39:54 And let me tell you folks,
03:39:55 my comic is the real deal.
03:39:57 It's got action, drama, romance and a badass female protagonist
03:40:01 who's not afraid to take down the bad guys.
03:40:04 Um, excuse me, Gib.
03:40:06 I'm pretty sure Biscopades is the superior comic here.
03:40:09 My characters are lovable.
03:40:10 My plot is engaging.
03:40:12 And did I mention it includes freaking beasts?
03:40:18 Yeah, but your comic doesn't even conform to gun control.
03:40:23 It does not.
03:40:25 I mean, how can you call it Biscopades without including some kind of gun wielding with animals?
03:40:31 Hey, what?
03:40:34 Hey, at least it's not a ripoff of Bard quest like your comic is.
03:40:39 Hey, Clarissa Gunsmoke is a completely original creation.
03:40:43 Thank you very much.
03:40:44 And it's going to be even better with the addition of all these amazing comics
03:40:48 submitted by our fans.
03:40:49 Yeah, speaking of which, did you see this one?
03:40:52 It's blowing up on Twitter.
03:40:53 I think it might just be more popular than our own comics.
03:40:57 Wait, what?
03:40:58 Let me see that.
03:40:59 Oh, wow.
03:41:01 That's actually really good.
03:41:02 Yeah.
03:41:02 Check all these likes and retweets.
03:41:04 People are flocking to this artist.
03:41:07 I'm so worried.
03:41:10 This is just great.
03:41:11 Now nobody cares about Clarissa Gunsmoke or Biscopades anymore.
03:41:15 Why would he?
03:41:15 Why do you even start the stupid project?
03:41:18 I don't know, Gib.
03:41:19 I had to sell my freaking Oculus Rift to pay rent this month.
03:41:24 And I'm making six anime Daki Macro reviews every week just to make ends meet.
03:41:28 Well, at least it's helped me lose some weight.
03:41:31 Starvation has its silver linings, I guess.
03:41:34 Wow, way to put a positive spin on things.
03:41:37 But seriously, do we, do you think we made a mistake with Perfect Comic Party?
03:41:42 I don't know.
03:41:43 I mean, it was a good idea at the time, but maybe we weren't ready for the competition.
03:41:49 I'm, uh, true.
03:41:53 But let's not give up yet.
03:41:54 Maybe we can come back even stronger with our next project.
03:41:57 And who knows, we might even discover the next big comic artist resolve.
03:42:04 Your fucking head.
03:42:05 Yeah.
03:42:07 These are, uh, these are very flattering.
03:42:09 These are very nice.
03:42:13 I'm scrolling, scrolling back up at their faces.
03:42:16 What?
03:42:16 Why can you call it?
03:42:17 How can you call it Biscopades without some sort of gun wielding animal?
03:42:22 Yeah, Ben.
03:42:23 It doesn't even conform to gun control.
03:42:26 My, I got a good argument there.
03:42:30 Yeah.
03:42:30 You got me a little bit.
03:42:32 Uh, okay.
03:42:33 Next one is, oh, that was the one we just looked at.
03:42:36 Oh, we got a freaking vocaroo.
03:42:39 Oh, I know what this is.
03:42:42 Wait, these are from Cheesy, aren't they?
03:42:46 Uh, I don't know.
03:42:48 Cause it's, cause it's, cause they're called, uh, Steve, no, an enderman, no.
03:42:53 Because, you know, like the block, the mecha block.
03:42:57 Oh, well, it might not be Cheesy.
03:42:59 Might be whoever's in the chat.
03:43:00 So, oh, okay.
03:43:02 Uh, three, two, one, go.
03:43:05 Steve, Steve, it's Steve.
03:43:07 It's Minecraft, Steve.
03:43:09 Mr. Minecraft, Steve himself.
03:43:11 What are you doing, man?
03:43:13 What are you doing with that big, big boy?
03:43:15 A wig, pickaxe, huh?
03:43:17 A large, sizable pickaxe for a mining society.
03:43:21 What are you doing, man?
03:43:23 You can't mind that.
03:43:25 That's the sacred block.
03:43:27 The Mohammed Rock.
03:43:29 Don't even think about it.
03:43:30 Don't touch the Muslim tetrahedron.
03:43:33 Don't, don't, don't mind it.
03:43:35 Do not mind the Muslim cuboid with your pickaxe.
03:43:38 Dimeoid.
03:43:39 Do.
03:43:40 That's a dick.
03:43:46 Okay.
03:43:47 Okay.
03:43:48 That's, that's a blue and fall.
03:43:50 Is it?
03:43:51 I mean, is that an AI voice?
03:43:53 It's an AI voice, but oblivion fall is, is, he loves that voice generator.
03:44:00 I, I, I may, it could be.
03:44:02 I feel like, I feel like it would be.
03:44:07 I guess, I guess I just don't know who else would submit such a thing.
03:44:10 You're right.
03:44:11 You're right.
03:44:12 Okay.
03:44:12 Well, there's one more called Enderman.
03:44:15 No.
03:44:17 So let's go.
03:44:21 All right.
03:44:22 Three, two, one, go.
03:44:24 The Enderman, the Enderman.
03:44:26 He's, he's that deskie pesky Enderman.
03:44:29 He's going to pick it up.
03:44:31 He's going to pick up the cube of Mohammed Rube.
03:44:33 The cube of Mohammed Rube.
03:44:35 This is not block game Mecca.
03:44:36 This is Muslimania Minecraftania.
03:44:39 Don't let him grasp it.
03:44:40 Do not let him grasp the cube.
03:44:42 Don't let him grasp it.
03:44:44 Do not let him grasp it.
03:44:45 No, he's grasping.
03:44:47 No, he's grasping.
03:44:50 I'm going to grasp.
03:44:50 Oh, it's grasping.
03:44:52 I'm going to grasp.
03:44:59 I will have a great time when, when that stupid slime and punishment
03:45:02 Kickstarter gets going.
03:45:03 I will have a great time telling people to pluge.
03:45:07 Oh, yeah.
03:45:09 And it works because pluge is like sploosh, like slime.
03:45:14 You could imagine dropping stuff into a slime thing.
03:45:16 It encourages people to save up a big, you know, a big cummy
03:45:20 load of lots of money and then just squirt it all over me on
03:45:25 my waiting face.
03:45:26 Oh, mess me up.
03:45:27 Mess me up.
03:45:28 I've lost my appetite.
03:45:30 Mess me up.
03:45:31 Mess me up with all that cash money.
03:45:34 Let's me up with a big Dono's big liquid stream of currency
03:45:40 on patreon.com slash the procrastinators.
03:45:42 You can pluge or content if you want to.
03:45:48 Yes.
03:45:49 Well, what do you think?
03:45:50 Are we are we concluded?
03:45:54 I was going to talk about having finished Utana and the
03:46:00 Al House is finished, but since you haven't seen those,
03:46:02 yeah, save that for another time.
03:46:04 Yeah, I have not seen either of those at all.
03:46:09 My recommendation should watch RRR.
03:46:12 It's really good.
03:46:12 It's really good film.
03:46:19 It's good.
03:46:19 It's a good movie.
03:46:20 It's the best movie I've seen in a while.
03:46:22 It was better than better than Northman, better than ever.
03:46:28 Everything everything everywhere in my opinion.
03:46:33 Uh, those are like the only two movies I saw last year.
03:46:39 I think it's even better than lock the movie where a guy is
03:46:44 sitting in his car on his phone for two hours.
03:46:47 It might even be better than that.
03:46:50 Crazy.
03:46:50 I know.
03:46:52 Okay.
03:46:52 Thanks for listening.
03:46:53 Okay.
03:46:54 We'll see you next week.
03:46:55 Go to amazon.com slash Clarissa Gunsmoke find my book and buy
03:47:00 it and have it do it.
03:47:01 Cherish it.
03:47:02 Do it.
03:47:02 Pludge, Pludge.
03:47:04 I mean, bye.
03:47:05 Bye.
03:47:08 Okay.
03:47:08 Bye.
03:47:09 Boy.
03:47:10 I'm trying to, you can't do an ooh sound with a bye.
03:47:13 Bowie, Bowie.
03:47:14 You're saying, you're saying, you're saying yes.
03:47:16 Bowie, yes.
03:47:17 Yes.
