00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.
00:00:30 If you're listening to this, it is Friday. It's 6.20pm.
00:00:35 They already know that.
00:00:37 That's useless information.
00:00:40 Oh my god. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I have nothing to talk about. Let's go to voicemails.
00:00:55 No. Let's talk about Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.
00:00:59 Fine. Very well. How's that going?
00:01:04 It's going quite well.
00:01:06 The numbers go up. I see number go up.
00:01:09 The number go up is we are at 79 backers as of recording. 2,571 pounds pledged. We're less than 500 away from the Redman...
00:01:22 Zeen.
00:01:25 I got it. I got it. I was thinking about it.
00:01:28 I know. I could tell you were thinking. And I wanted to make sure you came to the right conclusion.
00:01:34 You could have made fun of me if I got it wrong. You can't give it to me that easy.
00:01:40 I jumped the gun. I jumped the gun.
00:01:43 It's getting pretty close to the Redman Zeen. It's more than halfway towards the plush.
00:01:55 The plush.
00:01:58 Yes. I got the sample of the plush. I didn't get a sample. I got an image sent to me of the progress on the sample.
00:02:06 They've made a little first draft. They said, hey, do you want any changes?
00:02:10 I said a few things about it. But mostly, it's great. And it looks exactly like I wanted it.
00:02:17 It looks nice. How big is it?
00:02:20 It's a smaller plush than the Pumpk one. Although Pumpk is artificially big because her legs are really long and thin.
00:02:28 It's about six inches tall and quite round. You could put it on your desk. You could put it on a dog.
00:02:38 A dog could play with it. You could throw it. It's the sort of thing you could grab with one hand and you could have it.
00:02:49 That's the sort of feeling I wanted. You could just grab its face and just look at me.
00:02:57 That's cool. We got 23 days to go.
00:03:03 It's pretty good. It's pretty soft. Do you have the graph? Does it show you the graph of the money?
00:03:11 How do I find that? I'm on the side right now.
00:03:14 It's somewhere in the dashboard. Let me see. I can look at my old account.
00:03:21 Yeah, now I found it.
00:03:23 Show me the graph. I like the graph.
00:03:30 Here it is. Put it in general chat.
00:03:33 There we go. That's a pretty sharp beginning.
00:03:37 Yeah, it is. Then it kind of accelerated a little bit the two days ago.
00:03:46 Maybe that was the bump from the episode coming out?
00:03:50 Yeah, the episode coming out or one of the streams I did.
00:03:54 I'm going to be streaming more often for the opportunity to plug that while I'm playing.
00:04:00 If people somehow haven't, they're not on the Twitter and they're on my Twitch.
00:04:07 They're like, oh, I didn't know you were doing that. It'll be a good moment.
00:04:11 You were playing, what was it, House Flipper?
00:04:14 I was playing House Flipper the other day. I played Hollow Knight I think yesterday.
00:04:19 Right. I didn't catch that one.
00:04:21 That one was fun. I started off having no knowledge of Fortnite of Hollow Knight.
00:04:28 Hollow Knight is basically the same.
00:04:30 Have you not played Hollow Knight before?
00:04:32 I've never beaten it. I got four hours in once and then I stopped and that's it.
00:04:40 I played it through the first time with all the DLC.
00:04:46 It's a little awkward how all the DLC stuff kind of just exists on top of everything else.
00:04:54 I have no idea what it looks like without DLC if I even have it.
00:04:59 You might not be seeing it yet, but there's quests that are like, you got to go around and do stuff
00:05:05 and you got to collect shit and it's like shit that you...
00:05:11 When it released, I think the point was to kind of make you to go and re-explore the world with a new goal in mind.
00:05:18 But having it be present alongside everything else when you're playing the game
00:05:23 for the first time is a little bit like, wait, I got to do...
00:05:26 What are these things around? I got to get these too? Okay, I guess.
00:05:30 I don't know whether this is a DLC thing, but I saw these weird little trees, little bushes
00:05:38 and I couldn't do anything with them. I thought maybe they were special.
00:05:43 Are they the little dream catcher looking trees?
00:05:46 Are they curved, like bonsai trees with outlighted circles on them?
00:05:53 I don't know what they are, like little wheels.
00:05:55 I think I know... I don't think that's DLC stuff, although I don't even know what is DLC.
00:06:02 I know that the Grim Troop is... I'm calling it DLC.
00:06:05 I think the better word is Expansion Pack or whatever, because it was added to the game later.
00:06:12 I think that's like Dream Nail stuff, that tree, maybe. Do you have the Dream Nail?
00:06:19 I'm very early on. I've beaten the Screamy... the guy on the...
00:06:26 Oh God, I can't remember any of the places.
00:06:29 Where there's this rain and there's a city and you go up the tower
00:06:32 and there's that magic guy who has the magic and he throws at you.
00:06:35 Oh, I hate that guy, yeah.
00:06:38 You kill that guy and then you get the thing that makes you go smash down through glass panes.
00:06:44 Yeah, what's the place called? The City of Tears? I love that place.
00:06:48 City of Tears, yeah. It's my favorite location.
00:06:51 And then I got that and then I went down over to the crystal mines and that's where I stopped.
00:06:59 Yes, good. Did you meet that bug that sings?
00:07:04 There's a bug in the crystal mines that sings.
00:07:10 Oh, I haven't gone very far into the crystal mines. I was looking for the map and then I realized I had been going for like four and a half hours.
00:07:17 Keep an eye out for it, I guess.
00:07:21 I found the cute fat lady bug who's really shy and she makes a plush of you and writes fanfic about you when you save her.
00:07:36 Why don't I remember that?
00:07:38 You save her and she goes back and then she's on the bench and if you sit on the bench and wait for a few seconds she blushes.
00:07:44 What? Why don't I remember this? Oh no.
00:07:48 And then she's in one of the buildings off to the side and then sometimes it's like a...
00:07:54 I think the first time you go in there there's like a health item shard, mask shard and that was cool.
00:08:02 But next to her bed there's like a little fanfic she writes about the exploits of you, the white savior she calls you.
00:08:10 Base.
00:08:12 And because you're a little skull face.
00:08:16 And yeah, it starts off with just like a plush and then there's a poster and then there's like a bigger plush and then the fanfic continues.
00:08:25 She has dreams about you. It's kind of epic.
00:08:31 You know, I have... I think I know what you're talking about now, but I don't want to say anything.
00:08:37 I think I would spoil it. I think there might be some stuff going on out there that maybe you haven't seen yet.
00:08:45 Oh no.
00:08:48 I'll tell you, the one thing I am spoiled for is the grubs. If you save all the grubs, the main grub man is like, haha, thank you.
00:08:56 And then he eats them.
00:08:58 Yeah, I think that's true. I think that's true.
00:09:02 It's like, oh, it's scary. It's like fucked up. You just got played.
00:09:06 But it's like, I think it's like implied somewhere in the in-game like enemy description that like that's like normal and that's like part of the grub life cycle.
00:09:16 Like they're not dead, maybe. They're just inside of him.
00:09:20 So I think maybe it's not that fucked up.
00:09:22 That's just vor propaganda.
00:09:24 Yeah, I don't know. I think it's a little ambiguous. It's like, oh, it's, you thought you were doing a good thing, but I don't know. It was a bad thing.
00:09:32 Oh, but maybe it's not a bad thing, though.
00:09:34 Maybe it's okay.
00:09:36 Yeah.
00:09:38 Good game. A little bit the samey locations wise. A lot of the places look the same in Hollow Knight.
00:09:48 In Hollow Knight? Yeah, a couple places.
00:09:50 I mean, I've got to a point where I can, I'm starting to like differentiate the different places.
00:09:58 And like, I like it. I think the color palette is restrictive, but it works.
00:10:08 I think I, I think I, oh, I beat the Radiance and I beat Grim. I never did the like Godseeker stuff.
00:10:22 That stuff is like another like expansion pack thing. I never did anything.
00:10:26 That's like the, the true like ultimate bosses are in the Godseeker, but I didn't do them because it just didn't seem that interesting.
00:10:36 I like the Castlevania, if that was like a, like a boss rush kind of thing, I don't care about that that much.
00:10:40 I like the side scrollly exploration Castlevania bullshit.
00:10:46 Yeah, I'm not like, I'm not, I'm not that hardcore of a gamer.
00:10:54 Radiance was really hard, the final boss. I got stuck on her for, I think I got stuck on her for a while and I stopped playing for a while and I was, and it took me a long time to finally come back to it and beat her.
00:11:06 God, she's cool though. So fucking cool. She is the sun.
00:11:12 What a, what a visual. I don't know any of that. Oh, well, it's not, it's not literally true, but I don't know, you'll, you'll see, we'll see what I mean.
00:11:22 There's, there's bugs and some of them are knights and some of them are hollow. I mean, what more do I need?
00:11:28 She's, she's not, when I say that she, she is not like the actual sun up in the sky above hollownests. That's not, that's not the case.
00:11:38 Okay, I won't say anymore, but it's a good fucking video game.
00:11:44 I might play more of that on stream on twitch.tv slash gibbon take.
00:11:50 I am very bad with scheduling, so I, I have no plans to do it in any particular day, but I won't be doing it on Sundays because that's PCP recording.
00:12:00 I won't be doing it on Fridays because the PCP comes out or maybe I could, I don't know, there's no reason I couldn't.
00:12:06 But also on Wednesdays, we usually do heckles for shackles.
00:12:10 Yeah, true, true.
00:12:13 So some other time, maybe a Monday or a Tuesday.
00:12:18 You know what I did? You know, I started doing it yesterday. I actually started writing up the, the final Road to Radcon chapter.
00:12:27 I got like one page of it written. I wanted to be, I don't know how long I want it to be.
00:12:33 It's probably stupid, but I mean, you know, that's fine.
00:12:38 Are you going to attempt to mimic the writing style or is it just going to be the Benson chapter?
00:12:44 I, I, I would like to try to do that. I don't know how successful I would be.
00:12:52 I feel like I'm doing my best to mimic the writing style, but I, I don't, I think it's not, I think you can tell I wrote it, which is like, I don't know what to do about that.
00:13:06 Well, you could do your best. I mean, I'm sure I'm doing my best. I'm doing my best.
00:13:13 It's, it's going to be dumb. It's going to be goofy. And it should be a hoot.
00:13:21 Yeah, I tried, I tried getting drunk and writing it because I thought that that would be the right mindset to do it in, but it didn't work.
00:13:30 It didn't work that well. I just kind of didn't do it and I'm hungover this morning and I feel sick.
00:13:38 So, you know, didn't, didn't, huh?
00:13:42 What time is over there?
00:13:44 Oh, I guess it's, I guess it's not morning. It's 3 30pm. Well, but I only woke up at like noon, so it feels early.
00:13:55 I woke up at noon as well. So it's noon, it's noon days, these days.
00:14:01 I hung, I hung out with, I hung out with Munchie and Kazi and Ethan and Steve and, and Azkan and Zen Huxedable yesterday and I slept over on their couch.
00:14:14 Cool.
00:14:16 Yeah, it was pretty fun. We went and got ramen. It was good. You got ice cream. It was really good. It was really good.
00:14:26 I ate a bunch of food.
00:14:28 So I saw an image. I played smash of VR somewhere.
00:14:34 Oh, did he? Yeah, it's at the right. I forgot. We went to like a video. It's like a video game cafe.
00:14:41 It was goofy, but they had, they had an Oculus Rift that we took turns using a little bit.
00:14:48 I didn't, I didn't do it. I surrendered my time because I own an Oculus Rift.
00:14:53 The privilege.
00:14:55 Yes. They played a bunch of like Beat Saber and shit. Kazi literally just like did Google Earth and like looked around Google Earth in the VR headset.
00:15:08 You know, I would have never thought to do that, but that is possible with 360 everything.
00:15:14 Yeah, she was just like flying around. Was it Beijing, I think? Just looking at buildings.
00:15:20 Beijing.
00:15:21 Maybe it was Beijing.
00:15:23 Maybe Hong Kong. I don't think, does China not have Google stuff in it? I thought that was.
00:15:30 It wasn't Hong Kong. You can, surely you can see Beijing on Google Earth.
00:15:37 Check. Well, I don't know. I don't feel like you can't see Street View and stuff. Like they don't have Street View for that country.
00:15:47 Weird. Maybe that's true. I didn't even think, I didn't even consider that.
00:15:53 Like the China says, you can't have people drive cars and take pictures of all of our secrets.
00:16:00 Yeah, maybe, maybe so.
00:16:04 Maybe Google Earth is different from Google Maps. Maybe that's what I'm thinking.
00:16:09 I think it's the same. Like I think Street View is the same images for both.
00:16:15 Yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?
00:16:17 It must be.
00:16:18 Where's Beijing?
00:16:20 I don't know.
00:16:21 Where's Beijing?
00:16:22 I remember seeing the 2008 fucking Olympics. I remember it must have seen it on the map somewhere.
00:16:29 It's like, it's like a special place.
00:16:36 It's not inland, is it?
00:16:39 Most big things are by a river.
00:16:41 Most big things are on the coast or on the river, yeah.
00:16:45 It's the lifeblood. It's the lifeblood of society. It's water.
00:16:50 Water, water.
00:16:52 What has thou dunced?
00:16:54 Dunced? Oh, it is kind of inland. It's quite north.
00:16:59 Oh, I'm zooming. Okay, so Google does have...
00:17:05 How do I be down on the earth?
00:17:09 This is a riveting podcast content.
00:17:13 You can play along, guys. Play along.
00:17:16 Beijing is.
00:17:17 Beijing.
00:17:18 Go to Google that map.
00:17:20 Zoom in. Like flick your mouse to the left once, twice.
00:17:25 Get a plane ticket to Beijing and take a picture and send it to Google for Street View so we can see you.
00:17:34 Oh, alright. You can go down onto individuals' photographs.
00:17:40 So this person took a 360 photograph in Beijing and I can go and see this photograph from their perspective.
00:17:48 Like a Google employee or something?
00:17:52 No, no, just like a person. They uploaded their location to Google.
00:17:57 Oh.
00:17:58 And now the 360 image is...
00:18:03 Weird.
00:18:04 Seable.
00:18:05 So wait.
00:18:06 It's insane. It's madness.
00:18:09 So there's this big, epic, like Earth Kingdom temple house.
00:18:16 I'm going to put my old guy...
00:18:18 China totally ripped off the...
00:18:20 Right in the middle.
00:18:21 Ripped off Avatar, in my opinion.
00:18:23 Yeah.
00:18:24 I mean, what the fuck? Okay.
00:18:27 Just like Mulan. I'm there.
00:18:30 Just like...
00:18:31 It's just like that movie.
00:18:33 Just like Disney.
00:18:34 It's just like media.
00:18:36 It's like, aw, Pog.
00:18:38 When I see...
00:18:40 I meet a Chinese person and I go, it's just like Mulan.
00:18:44 I've seen this movie.
00:18:47 Oh dear. This is cool though.
00:18:49 I didn't know you could see any of China.
00:18:51 I thought it was like Google no-no zone.
00:18:54 Google no-no zone.
00:18:56 Yeah.
00:18:59 Based.
00:19:01 Anyway, there was...
00:19:03 Yes, there was VR.
00:19:05 There was video games.
00:19:08 And we ate food and I don't know.
00:19:11 And then I got drunk and I passed out and now I'm hungover.
00:19:14 And that was my...
00:19:15 Oh, and I practiced inkling.
00:19:17 I won't say I got a little good at playing inkling in Smash,
00:19:20 but I sort of figured the character out a little bit.
00:19:23 And that was kind of fun.
00:19:25 You know, when you squirt the ink, it's good.
00:19:28 You should be squirting ink.
00:19:30 You should be shooting ink when you're inkling.
00:19:33 That's the trick.
00:19:35 You should be squirting.
00:19:37 My problem in Smash is that I don't guard and I don't roll.
00:19:42 Yeah, why would you do that when you could attack and squirt ink?
00:19:46 That's right.
00:19:47 Anytime you're not squirting ink as inkling is just waste of time.
00:19:52 You're just losing...
00:19:54 You're surrendering board state.
00:19:56 You've got to be putting ink on the ground all the time.
00:19:59 I...
00:20:01 There were so many times I would be like,
00:20:04 yes, I've set up for the kill.
00:20:06 Yes, I've got them.
00:20:07 I've got them in my sights.
00:20:08 And then I pull out the roller and I do the forward...
00:20:11 I think it's the forward B rolling attack.
00:20:13 And then there's no ink and it just doesn't work.
00:20:16 And then they go, aha!
00:20:18 And they punish me because I wasn't looking at the bar.
00:20:21 I wasn't looking at the ink meter.
00:20:23 It's a nightmare.
00:20:25 It's a fucking nightmare.
00:20:27 And you can't refill the ink meter unless it's already empty, I think,
00:20:30 unless you can and I just never figured out how to do it.
00:20:32 That would be embarrassing.
00:20:34 Did you play as Minecraft Steve?
00:20:36 No!
00:20:38 No!
00:20:39 That's so crazy.
00:20:40 But Zen was playing as Creeper.
00:20:43 But Creeper is not a Minecraft Steve re-skin.
00:20:46 He's a me-fighter for some reason.
00:20:51 He's just a me-fighter brawler, I guess.
00:20:55 I don't know why they did that.
00:20:57 I feel like he should be Steve, but he's not.
00:21:01 He should have a little pickaxe.
00:21:03 He should go ding, ding, ding, ding, ding up stuff.
00:21:05 You know what I thought?
00:21:06 I was thinking about like Mario Sunshine and how the flood,
00:21:09 you get the water and you splash and you get rid of all the goop.
00:21:12 True.
00:21:13 You get exactly the same sort of goop as like the Splatoon kids.
00:21:16 Splatoon?
00:21:17 Like what if Mario from Mario Sunshine with the flood versus the Splatoon?
00:21:25 Like the Splatoon splats.
00:21:27 It's like, dude, asymmetrical multiplayer where one player,
00:21:32 One giant Mario.
00:21:34 It's a team of Splatoons.
00:21:36 Oh my god, that would be so funny.
00:21:38 What if in like Splatoon 3 they have it as a multiplayer mode
00:21:41 where like four players play as inklings
00:21:43 and one player plays as Mario from Mario Sunshine with the flood?
00:21:49 It just seems like such an obvious versus.
00:21:53 But because Mario Sunshine is so old, it'll never happen officially.
00:21:59 I'll never acknowledge the idea.
00:22:01 Now that you say it, it makes perfect sense.
00:22:05 It makes perfect sense and I want it.
00:22:07 These squids are just trying to make a mess and Mario is like,
00:22:09 No, do not make a mess.
00:22:11 So you splash.
00:22:13 Yes, true, true.
00:22:19 Man, Splatoon is so fucking cool.
00:22:21 Aesthetically, I mean.
00:22:23 I'm pretty bad at it.
00:22:25 I'm pretty bad at most competitive games and shooters in particular.
00:22:30 There's too much splash and going on.
00:22:33 There's just too much dang ink.
00:22:35 It's a bad influence.
00:22:36 Oh, I can't believe they would depict someone squirting ink in a piece of media.
00:22:42 Do they have a fountain pen weapon yet?
00:22:44 Do they have like a fountain pen sniper rifle?
00:22:47 I feel like they do, but I don't know.
00:22:51 Maybe not.
00:22:52 It seems like something they would have.
00:22:55 No, they got rollers, they got brushes, they got buckets, and they got guns.
00:23:02 You know what else? Okami.
00:23:04 Okami, a mattress who dip the god dog brush tail and draw stuff with it, with the ink.
00:23:15 I think I saw, I watched Tim Rogers' review of Okami and he didn't like it that much.
00:23:23 What did he say?
00:23:25 He said that obviously it looks great and the art style is great,
00:23:29 but the game is basically just a Zelda and as a Zelda it's not that impressive.
00:23:34 It's like a pretty mediocre Zelda, which I guess that makes sense.
00:23:41 I think I've heard that comparison before, but I don't like Zelda because I don't like the way it looks so there.
00:23:47 Yeah, true.
00:23:49 Actually Wind Waker is really nice.
00:23:51 Twilight Princess is ugly and that's it.
00:23:55 The only 3D Zelda I've ever played is Ocarina, which I went back and replayed it just a couple years ago just to know what the deal was.
00:24:10 Is Ocarina one of those games where it's completely impossible to figure out unless you have the strategy guide like the first Zelda?
00:24:20 I mean that's not impossible, but there's a lot of esoteric things in the first Zelda game.
00:24:26 It's not like that, it's not like that.
00:24:31 No, I think you could beat Ocarina without a strategy.
00:24:36 No, there's that one thing where you have to give the fish to the thing to make it open its mouth.
00:24:43 I think that part is a little bit like how would you know to do that?
00:24:48 It's a jub-jub? Is that how you get into jub-jub's belly?
00:24:51 Jabba's belly? Who's fucking belly do you go in with the Zora Princess?
00:24:55 Wait, have I played this game? Have I played Ocarina? I don't even know. I feel like I've watched so much of it.
00:25:02 And I remember playing it briefly, but I don't know how long I played it.
00:25:07 It definitely didn't win. Definitely did not beat the game, but...
00:25:11 I beat Ocarina, and then I thought like, boy, everyone says Majora's Mask is the good one.
00:25:18 Maybe I should have played Majora's Mask instead, but now I don't want to because even though I know that they're completely different games,
00:25:26 they look similar, so I feel like I kind of got a lot of the experience from playing the first one,
00:25:32 which is probably wrong, and it's probably a stupid way to look at it, but instinctively that's how I feel.
00:25:37 I already played the game with all the same assets, even if it's a different game, so I'm done.
00:25:44 I guess I'm not that much of a Zelda head. I played a bunch of the 2D ones.
00:25:48 I mean, I actually beat Zelda 2 Link's Awakening.
00:25:53 Wow.
00:25:54 It was the one nobody plays, the one nobody likes.
00:25:58 I've heard people like it. It's just really difficult.
00:26:02 It is really difficult. I beat it, and I beat the original Zelda 1, maybe like 7 or 8 years ago.
00:26:14 I used guides for both. I just had a lot of free time, and I had NES, and I was like,
00:26:20 I had these games as kids, and I never beat them because I was a dumb kid, so I'm going to do it, and I did.
00:26:29 My feeling with Mario and Zelda and stuff is that I didn't even know what that shit was.
00:26:38 Mario?
00:26:40 Well, I think I knew Mario because I'd seen him in gaming magazines, but I'd never had a Nintendo 64.
00:26:46 To me, Nintendo was entirely Pokémon, and then I didn't know any of that stuff until the angry video game nerd taught me all about the NES.
00:26:56 I was like, whoa, what? That's what the NES was.
00:27:00 When in Pokémon Blue, they said the player played with the NES.
00:27:04 I thought that was someone's NES bit, like someone's name.
00:27:10 I didn't get it, and then I got it. That was my introduction.
00:27:14 So I don't have desire to go back, necessarily, and play all these old games from my childhood.
00:27:20 They're games from AVGN's childhood, which is somewhat my childhood, a little bit.
00:27:26 My young teenagerhood or something.
00:27:33 Fuck that guy. Fuck reviews. Fuck internet. Fuck videos. No.
00:27:40 I will never listen to another video game review ever again because they're all liars.
00:27:46 What about all of those ones you're about to watch?
00:27:50 Well, I'll do those, obviously. Obviously, I'm still going to watch those.
00:27:55 But after that, I'm done. It's over.
00:28:02 I genuinely listen to... I genuinely spend a lot more time listening to people talk about media than I do just consuming media.
00:28:11 I don't know if that's a problem. I don't know if that's weird, but...
00:28:17 I think it's just because it's easy.
00:28:20 A piece of review, you go into it expecting them to explain everything, and they're just going to tell you all about it.
00:28:29 You don't need to lift a finger. You don't even need to press start.
00:28:32 You don't need to do any work to figure out what the fuck's up with this game.
00:28:36 I have no interest in watching a movie and any movies at all.
00:28:43 But I am interested if someone is like, this movie says something about our society.
00:28:48 I am interested to be like, oh, what do you think it says about our society?
00:28:54 Yeah, that's where I'm at with media, I guess.
00:28:58 Did you watch Parasite?
00:29:00 No, I didn't see Parasite.
00:29:03 You probably heard movie reviews, though, about it.
00:29:06 I don't know if I heard any reviews. I mean, I definitely heard people talk about it.
00:29:10 I don't know if I watched any reviews.
00:29:12 It's a really good one, but everyone would say that.
00:29:15 It seemed good. It seemed like a good film.
00:29:19 It's one of the only movies of the last 25 years that I've watched.
00:29:25 I don't watch movies, really.
00:29:28 But I was forced to watch that one.
00:29:31 Because somebody said please, and I was like, okay.
00:29:34 I watched, I think like the last movie, oh no, I watched The Witch, The Vavitch a couple months ago.
00:29:46 And I was pretty good.
00:29:48 And I watched, the only time I watched movies are when I met my parents' house.
00:29:52 Yeah, I watched The Witch.
00:29:54 And before that, like Christmas, I watched Flushed Away, The Artman.
00:30:01 That movie's good. That movie's actually good.
00:30:04 It's all right.
00:30:06 I thought it was better than all right.
00:30:08 I was like, wow, that sure was a compelling, pretty conventional three act structure that I just experienced.
00:30:16 God, I love that glistening three act structure.
00:30:19 It worked for me.
00:30:23 What was it?
00:30:24 I was going to say, oh, and I watched that one.
00:30:26 What's the one with Snake Plissken?
00:30:28 That one.
00:30:29 Escape from New York.
00:30:30 I watched Escape from New York also at Christmas with my parents for some reason.
00:30:34 That's the only time.
00:30:35 Flushed Away and Escape from New York basically the same.
00:30:39 It's, you know, there's the call to action.
00:30:42 There's the, you know, the crossing the threshold, the meeting with the goddess, the whatever thing that happens.
00:30:51 The lowest point in the second act, obviously, they're the same.
00:30:56 There's only seven stories that have ever been told, and those are two of them.
00:31:02 Flushed Away and Escape from New York.
00:31:06 Leaving only five possible new stories to be made.
00:31:10 That's right.
00:31:12 Lord of Ghosts was one of them.
00:31:14 So that one's taken now.
00:31:16 That one's taken too.
00:31:17 Yeah.
00:31:18 It's over.
00:31:19 God, I still, I still gotta write the, I keep meaning to, obviously.
00:31:24 It's like the classic dilemma.
00:31:27 Oh, but I kept meaning to do it, but I just didn't do it.
00:31:30 Well, I guess I'll just continue.
00:31:33 Like who cares?
00:31:34 It's like, it'll be done when it's done.
00:31:36 Gotta write the things.
00:31:38 I also want to.
00:31:39 You should, don't be like me.
00:31:40 Don't be like me and put it off.
00:31:42 I put it off for so long doing my vapor arts.
00:31:45 It was really a mistake and foolish of me.
00:31:48 Some, some days I'll wake up and I'm like, okay, well, I gotta buy ingredients so that
00:31:53 I can cook dinner.
00:31:54 That's today's goal.
00:31:56 I go out, I get the ingredients, I come back.
00:32:00 I sit around and I'm like, well, I'll, I'll work on it after I cook dinner because that's
00:32:05 it'll take a little while.
00:32:06 I cook dinner.
00:32:07 I eat it.
00:32:08 And I'm like, well, I won't do it.
00:32:12 The day's over.
00:32:13 I did one thing.
00:32:14 That's enough.
00:32:15 I'm accomplished.
00:32:16 Fair.
00:32:17 I've, I've done in exactly one thing.
00:32:19 And oh, look at the Kickstarter as a whole other person.
00:32:22 You know what?
00:32:23 Everything's going well.
00:32:24 I don't need to work today.
00:32:26 Yeah.
00:32:27 Yeah.
00:32:28 I got, I'm, you got that one, uh, you got that one pledge that's today paid for.
00:32:33 Yeah.
00:32:34 I know the feeling.
00:32:35 Uh, I, I actually had a run recently of maybe like two weeks or so where I was like feverishly.
00:32:44 I got into like a mood or something.
00:32:46 I got into the headspace where I was feverishly grinding out stuff for the phantom's revenge
00:32:52 game.
00:32:53 Yeah.
00:32:54 You mentioned I would like, I was basically doing nothing but that for like, and then I,
00:32:59 I looked back at my, um, cause you know, I have the, I have the secret chat where I post
00:33:04 like updates and stuff that I'm working on for it in my, in my, my server.
00:33:08 My server is not patrons only, but that channel is for his patron channel.
00:33:12 And I look back at like the stuff I'm posting and I realized I spent basically the entire
00:33:17 month of June just grinding out, uh, basically enemy sprites and like sprites for the like
00:33:25 attack animations.
00:33:26 Uh, I didn't realize I spent like a whole month doing it, but I sure did and it really took
00:33:34 that long.
00:33:35 It wasn't like I was just fucking around.
00:33:37 So I don't know.
00:33:38 Boy, I sure hope they came out good because I spent a really long time on them.
00:33:44 Uh, but, uh, I guess it was worth it.
00:33:47 I guess I, I think it's looking pretty good.
00:33:49 I had hoped that the game would be done by now, but it's not.
00:33:53 And that's just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.
00:33:58 Yeah.
00:33:59 But yeah, I was, I was really grinding.
00:34:03 I was really grinding.
00:34:04 Uh, and then a couple of days ago, I think I was like, I can't, I can't do it anymore.
00:34:10 I can't do it anymore.
00:34:11 And I fell off and I lost my momentum and then I didn't do anything this weekend on it.
00:34:16 So I need to try and get myself back into another one of those sprints because I have a bunch
00:34:23 more things I need to do.
00:34:25 Um, it's getting, it's pretty close to being done, but like the things that I have left
00:34:31 to do are things that I don't exactly know how long it will take me.
00:34:35 Uh, then it'll take ages because you'll come in, you'll come up to a point where like,
00:34:40 yeah, I mean, I've got to do this one thing, but like one thing that you don't know how to do
00:34:45 contains within it hundreds of hours of learning that you need to do or preparation.
00:34:52 I don't know.
00:34:53 It's just one of those sort of things.
00:34:54 If you are, if you're not sure how long something's going to take, it'll probably take an extremely long time.
00:35:00 The game, the demo that I put out was eight rooms long.
00:35:06 And I needed, I wanted every room to have a cutscene, but not every room would have like a real cutscene.
00:35:11 Some rooms would just have like one line of dialogue and that's, and that's the scene.
00:35:15 Um, so some, some, a couple of the rooms would have fairly extensive, maybe like two of the rooms
00:35:21 would have an actual like extensive cutscene where like a character walks around, does animations,
00:35:28 does stuff beyond just like say a line.
00:35:31 And then I, I need to add, I need to add another room.
00:35:36 There's another room that needs to be added that will also have a pretty extensive cutscene in it, take place in it.
00:35:43 Um, and then I added a couple of features.
00:35:47 I added a couple of new like battle commands to it that they work, but I think they need to be debugged a little bit.
00:35:54 I think they, they act a little weird sometimes in like certain outlier situations.
00:36:00 Like when the, like when you die while you're doing them, then like the animation looks weird.
00:36:06 And I'm like, okay, I have to fix that.
00:36:08 So it doesn't look weird when that happens.
00:36:10 Um, you know, that, that kind of thing debugging basically.
00:36:13 Um, the cutscenes though, the cutscenes there, that's a thing where I could probably work on them for like a whole year.
00:36:23 If I wanted to make them real fancy, and I need to not do that.
00:36:28 Yes.
00:36:29 I need, I need to, because I mean, I think I've gotten a little, a little bit fancy with some of the like attack animations.
00:36:35 And that's maybe why it took so long.
00:36:37 Um, and I, I think it to the point that it actually looks like it's maybe a little fancier than like the Super Nintendo style that it's going for.
00:36:49 I want the game to look like it, it's like a Super Nintendo aesthetic.
00:36:53 Uh, but I think some of the effects are a little bit, the too many pixels.
00:36:59 They have, they have extra pixels.
00:37:01 So they're a little like, finely detailed in a way that is like, hmm, you, maybe you couldn't do that on the Super Nintendo.
00:37:08 Uh, but it's fine.
00:37:09 It's okay.
00:37:10 Uh, I just gotta not worry about it.
00:37:13 I just gotta not worry about it and just, and just keep chugging along and just get it done.
00:37:17 Art is never completed, only abandoned.
00:37:20 Hmm.
00:37:21 Yeah.
00:37:22 It's good that you're doing stuff.
00:37:23 I've, I've.
00:37:24 It is good that I'm doing stuff.
00:37:26 I feel good about it.
00:37:27 Well, now I feel bad because I haven't worked on it for a few days.
00:37:30 Uh, but.
00:37:31 I mean, I haven't been working on fucking anything for months.
00:37:35 Well, I mean.
00:37:36 This Kickstarter is, is, is like the most work I've been doing.
00:37:40 It's really just like number munching and organizing and like.
00:37:48 Well, I mean, doing the, I mean, doing the like, um, I mean, there's real work involved in the Kickstarter.
00:37:55 Like you had to do the, like you, you made the design for the plush and stuff.
00:38:00 And you had to write it all up and, and you know, set up the goal.
00:38:04 I mean, yeah, it's not like it wasn't work, but like, I had just been like, I mean, I only thought of that.
00:38:09 I mean, I only thought of that idea.
00:38:10 I only did all that since, um, what was this?
00:38:13 I forget their name.
00:38:14 Hoodie.
00:38:15 Was it Hoodie?
00:38:16 Hoodie, Hoodie in zero.
00:38:17 Yeah.
00:38:18 Like the Cato, the Cato guys.
00:38:20 They suggested the doing of like Laura Ghost Kickstarter.
00:38:24 And so before that point, I had just been feeling sick and not doing any drawing all year.
00:38:30 And it was just like, I had been doing working on my secret project, which I put on hold.
00:38:38 And it's, I just, I just want to get be doing things, you know, I just want to be like,
00:38:44 I want to be chugging along and chugging along and making like Lord of Ghost Act three Clarissa
00:38:49 like finished and then all of these other things I have.
00:38:54 I just, I just spend most of the day watching like German live stream vods and doing like
00:39:04 playing video games.
00:39:05 And it's, it's cringe.
00:39:07 I, I hate, I just cringe it.
00:39:10 I'm cringing it myself.
00:39:12 I have, I have been, um, I have been binging a lot of, um, a lot of, a lot of long like
00:39:20 JRPG speedruns from like RPG limit break.
00:39:23 I think they did like a marathon recently and there's a bunch of like, they did a 10
00:39:28 hour legend of Dragoon run.
00:39:31 I watched all of that.
00:39:33 Uh, they, I think I'm in, I'm in the middle of a, of a Final Fantasy 10, uh, one which
00:39:39 is also like really, really long.
00:39:41 This is, I've been putting those on while I do other stuff.
00:39:44 Uh, I, I, uh, I can't believe that it's end of June, which means that I've been working
00:39:53 on this game for six months.
00:39:56 I started at the end of December.
00:39:59 I, I can't believe it's been six months.
00:40:02 I just don't understand.
00:40:04 I don't know what I was doing.
00:40:06 I mean, I guess I've been working on it, on the game and like, I just, the time went
00:40:11 by so fast and I like, I thought it was going to take me like maybe two months to do the
00:40:16 game because the, the champion game, I literally made that in like three weeks.
00:40:21 This, this game has taken me, I didn't expect it to take me this long.
00:40:25 I'm, I'm just in shock that the, it has flown by and I don't know where it went.
00:40:31 It's weird.
00:40:32 I just don't feel like summer.
00:40:34 Well, it's hot.
00:40:36 Well, I mean, like it doesn't feel like it's where, you know, past spring, like that doesn't
00:40:41 make sense.
00:40:42 I didn't feel like spring even began.
00:40:45 Yeah.
00:40:46 I feel like it was cold just a little while ago.
00:40:50 Yeah, I do.
00:40:51 I don't, where did spring go?
00:40:53 Oh no.
00:40:55 It's the vaccine.
00:40:56 It's making me lose time.
00:40:58 It's making me lose time because this is my control of microchip.
00:41:02 Oh, microchip.
00:41:04 That's what did, oh, that explains it.
00:41:06 What are you doing?
00:41:07 That explains everything.
00:41:08 What was I, what was I was doing at night, the, at night, the, the microchip activates
00:41:15 and I lose, and I lose a week at a time because I disappeared to go out into the streets and
00:41:20 and protest like a BLM and Tifa thug and smash windows to get Joe Biden reelected.
00:41:28 They didn't know that last year.
00:41:30 They just been doing it for no reason.
00:41:32 They didn't.
00:41:33 They didn't.
00:41:34 Yeah.
00:41:35 Well, they never turned it off.
00:41:36 They didn't know.
00:41:37 They didn't need to give me a microchip.
00:41:38 I was going to do that anyway.
00:41:39 They didn't need to chip me.
00:41:41 That was the plan all along.
00:41:44 I saw, what did I see?
00:41:46 I saw some, saw some fucking freak on Twitter.
00:41:49 Was it Tim Pool?
00:41:50 I don't know.
00:41:51 I'm a fucking idiot saying like, that the, you know, and Tifa is like the Joe Biden army
00:41:59 and Tifa just loves Joe Biden.
00:42:01 They got him elected.
00:42:02 They rioted to get Joe Biden elected.
00:42:04 I'm sick.
00:42:05 You're insane.
00:42:06 You're fucking the world is full of sick freaks.
00:42:09 Say things like this.
00:42:10 And I'm upset.
00:42:12 Fortunately, I can't see it because Twitter is bugged.
00:42:15 Twitter is broken.
00:42:16 It's not working for me.
00:42:18 It's not loading.
00:42:19 That is the best.
00:42:20 You're insane.
00:42:21 It's great.
00:42:22 Twitter to be broken.
00:42:23 It's super good.
00:42:24 Yeah.
00:42:25 I can't fucking see anything on there.
00:42:26 And my life is richer for it.
00:42:28 Maybe I'll just let it stay bugs.
00:42:30 Maybe I hope those never fix it.
00:42:33 I think I might need to like track and like get, get the, bring out the big guns.
00:42:42 Like the harsh truths, the strict, the harsh mistresses.
00:42:47 What does that mean?
00:42:49 It means I got to like knuckle down and ban myself from all of this YouTube crap that
00:42:58 I've like, it worked before like the forcing myself to not look at something.
00:43:04 And then I go onto it and I'm like, oh, but I want to click on Twitter.
00:43:09 I want to click on YouTube.
00:43:11 And then like an hour later, I'm like, well, I may as well make progress in my life's work.
00:43:17 And then I do it.
00:43:18 I've got to turn that back on.
00:43:19 I turned it off because I was sick.
00:43:21 It's been too long.
00:43:22 I think it's perpetuating my sickness.
00:43:25 I see.
00:43:26 I see the, I mean, the, I am literally going to install a website blocker specifically
00:43:34 so that I don't go to DoorDash and order food anymore.
00:43:38 I, I develop, I have developed a crippling addiction to ordering a fried chicken and pizza.
00:43:45 And it's really bad.
00:43:48 Yeah.
00:43:49 It's bad because I'm fat now, but also because it costs so much.
00:43:52 It costs like 30 fucking dollars to order anything from anywhere.
00:43:55 It's always $30, no matter what it is.
00:43:58 That's quite a lot.
00:44:00 It's quite a lot.
00:44:02 So I need to, yeah, no, I can't let myself do it anymore.
00:44:05 I can't, I can't allow it.
00:44:10 But I mean, my, my, my justification to myself was like, eh, I'll just eat a bunch of junk food
00:44:15 because I'm, because I'm working out now because I'm lifting now and I'm getting really strong.
00:44:19 So it's, it's good.
00:44:21 Like the classic like, oh, and all the fucking things is like, oh, well, and now that I started
00:44:27 my diet and I've started my like exercise, one little many donuts won't hurt.
00:44:35 I mean, it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a cope.
00:44:38 It's a bit of a cope.
00:44:39 There's a little bit of truth to it because like I have gotten stronger.
00:44:43 I have, I have my lifts are up and I think that they have gone up faster because I've been eating a lot
00:44:49 because you got to live, you got to eat big to get big.
00:44:51 You got to eat huge to get huge.
00:44:53 You got to fuel, you got to turn your body into a metabolic furnace.
00:44:56 I mean, I think I, so I have gotten a bit stronger, which is good.
00:45:02 I'm, I'm in a, I want, I really like that my lifts go up.
00:45:06 I like when number go up, but also I'm getting fat and I don't like when that number go up.
00:45:11 But yeah, I heard you'd said that last time only both number go up, both number go up or both number go down.
00:45:17 I have to choose.
00:45:19 I have to choose get like non fried chicken, like just actual chicken.
00:45:25 You fucking nerd.
00:45:27 And like, why would I want to eat that?
00:45:30 I don't know.
00:45:31 It's chicken.
00:45:32 It's, it's not, that's not delicious.
00:45:34 Yeah, but number go up for, for strength, but that's not what I'm going down for weight.
00:45:40 Yeah, I mean, I mean, obviously you're correct.
00:45:45 Obviously you're correct.
00:45:47 I mean, I, I was doing this thing that was like super easy, like pan fried chicken breast.
00:45:55 It was just some oil.
00:45:57 I put the chicken on it.
00:45:59 And I know before that I put like a mixture of like salt, pepper and herbs and some, some flour and just rolled it in that and put it in there.
00:46:10 And it's just like fried chicken, except it's, it's good and good for you.
00:46:15 Literally the thing, the thing that the thing about ordering food from DoorDash is just that I don't have to cook, right?
00:46:24 Like if I, if I have to cook food, then I will eat less of it because I just, I just won't bother cooking.
00:46:31 I'll be like too lazy.
00:46:32 I'll be like, oh, I want to eat something.
00:46:34 I'm going to, I'm going to do some boredom eating.
00:46:37 Oh, but I'd have to cook to do it.
00:46:39 Oh, it's not worth the effort.
00:46:40 Never mind.
00:46:41 That's the, yeah.
00:46:43 I've been feeling like that as well.
00:46:45 I just, yeah, I just got to do it though.
00:46:48 Yeah.
00:46:49 I need, I'm like, I'm hungry right now, but I didn't eat lunch.
00:46:53 I'm like, uh, damn, now I'm doing PCP.
00:46:55 I can't, I got to eat afterwards.
00:46:57 And I don't have like a plan.
00:47:00 I can reheat something or I could just cook a big thing of rice and just eat rice.
00:47:05 And that, you know, that'll work.
00:47:07 It'll be energy, I guess.
00:47:09 It won't be nice, but I go to do something.
00:47:12 I feel sick from being a little hungover, but I'm sick in a way.
00:47:16 Like I feel a little gross, like I don't want to eat because of, because I'm sick.
00:47:22 But also you ever, you ever feel nauseous, but in a way that you're like, hmm,
00:47:27 if I could just eat just the right thing, it would cure my nausea.
00:47:32 You ever feel that?
00:47:33 Um, I don't think so.
00:47:35 Mostly because I don't think eating.
00:47:38 Well, now that I think about it, maybe.
00:47:41 I think, I think I feel nauseous when I anticipate eating or drinking the same thing again.
00:47:48 When I, sometimes, when I feel nauseous, sometimes I get like, man, if I just eat like an orange,
00:47:54 that'll like cure it and then I'll feel better.
00:47:57 But it's never true.
00:47:58 I just eat it and then I feel more full and I feel sicker.
00:48:01 I was like, if I eat something healthy, it'll, it'll fix the like.
00:48:04 Oh, you mean what?
00:48:05 Like when you're stuffed?
00:48:07 Yeah, or just not wanting to eat for any reason.
00:48:12 Most of the times when I feel nauseous is because I have a taste in my mouth and I'm like,
00:48:16 I don't want any more of that taste.
00:48:17 I need something different.
00:48:19 Hmm.
00:48:20 Hmm.
00:48:22 I, this is totally off topic, but I wanted to mention it.
00:48:27 I was thinking about my, my dream where my uncle Joe Rogan killed a guy because he wanted to go drunk driving.
00:48:35 And I realized that the gun, the gun, the big silver gun that he shot that guy's head off with before
00:48:42 making it through a window.
00:48:44 It was the, it was Vash's gun from Try Gun.
00:48:47 Do you know the gun I'm talking about?
00:48:49 Yeah, yeah, of course.
00:48:50 It was a big, big, big flat silver.
00:48:52 It was the big flat silver gun.
00:48:54 It was that gun or it looked just like it.
00:48:56 I was like, huh?
00:48:58 But didn't know Joe Rogan was such a fucking weeb.
00:49:02 He has a recreation Vash the Stampede gun that kills people with her fun.
00:49:08 Good old, good old uncle Joe.
00:49:19 Okay.
00:49:20 Podcast's over.
00:49:21 Wait, wait.
00:49:22 Well, yes.
00:49:24 But Lord of Ghosts though.
00:49:26 Lord of, Lord of Ghosts, everybody.
00:49:28 Oh.
00:49:29 I know last episode, it was like, it was small.
00:49:32 It was a small little moment because of the tales gets trolled guys, like more important.
00:49:37 It was unfortunate timing because I just launched it and wanted to talk about it.
00:49:41 But if you don't know, Lord of Ghosts is a comic that I've written and I'm continuing to write.
00:49:49 I'm printing the first two acts of the comic in physical book form where you can have it.
00:49:58 And there's a little enamel pin, just like the vapor is just, I'm just copying Ben St.
00:50:04 Hell yeah.
00:50:06 And I'm just going to copy Ben St. steal his ideas and it'll be great.
00:50:12 I think you should go to the Kickstarter.
00:50:14 You should watch the funny video and get addicted to the song.
00:50:17 I think you should give me a cut.
00:50:19 I think you should give me a cut since you stole my idea of charging money for a product.
00:50:25 I'll give you a cut when you have drawn the ghost story that you will draw.
00:50:31 That's true.
00:50:32 Okay.
00:50:33 Fair.
00:50:34 Yes.
00:50:35 Good.
00:50:36 My portion.
00:50:37 My royalties.
00:50:38 I will call them.
00:50:41 I'm excited.
00:50:43 I'm excited for that zine.
00:50:44 I'm excited for that red man zine.
00:50:47 I really want it.
00:50:48 I really want that added value.
00:50:51 Hey, you had like restricted, it was the Doodle rewards, right?
00:51:00 You had like a limited number available and they're sold out.
00:51:03 Oh, oh yeah.
00:51:05 The maximum, the biggest one, 45 pounds, the signed comic with the Doodle and the ghost pin.
00:51:15 25 backers no reward, no longer available.
00:51:18 That is crazy.
00:51:19 I didn't expect that one to max out first.
00:51:24 Yeah, so I mean, I could, you could get the Doodle but not with the pin now, I guess.
00:51:35 I think I'm probably going to have extra pins, so I might make it so if I'm going to be doing
00:51:41 other Doodles, I might as well just lump them all in together and you can pay more if you
00:51:45 want the pin.
00:51:46 Yeah.
00:51:48 Because if people want, you know, they're willing to pay for the Doodle.
00:51:54 They probably also want the pin as well.
00:51:56 So, I don't know.
00:51:58 Yeah, I definitely would.
00:52:01 It's like if I'm buying the book, like, yeah, I want the fucking pin.
00:52:06 Well, of course.
00:52:07 Yeah, so yeah, I'll make a note about that.
00:52:14 Do I click an update?
00:52:15 Is that what I do?
00:52:16 I don't know.
00:52:17 Let's make an update.
00:52:21 How many pins did you have made?
00:52:24 I haven't had them made yet.
00:52:26 I was waiting until...
00:52:27 Oh, you just got the sample piece.
00:52:29 Yeah, I got the samples and I'm like, ah, this looks great.
00:52:32 I'll tell you when the, I know how many I need to order because it was the minimum was 50,
00:52:38 but I'm thinking I might need 100 just to cover everything.
00:52:44 And I want to know that before I, you know, order it.
00:52:50 And I was keeping it open and just in case it was really successful out of nowhere
00:52:56 and I needed like 200 pins, which is unlikely, but you know.
00:53:01 Oh, I want it.
00:53:06 I want the pin.
00:53:07 Now, now I know people, people, when I, when I did my Kickstarter and I offered pins,
00:53:12 people were like, oh, pin, pinpog, I want the pin.
00:53:15 Now I'm on the other side and I understand.
00:53:17 I understand pin hype.
00:53:19 It's just so, it's so fun.
00:53:22 I'm looking at it right now.
00:53:24 Yeah.
00:53:25 Yeah.
00:53:27 I like, I made that tweet comparing the one, the Lord of Ghost, a smear,
00:53:33 the smear pin from the RFCK Kickstarter.
00:53:36 I like it's, I just think it's funny that there's two, two different takes.
00:53:41 Yeah.
00:53:42 On the character.
00:53:44 Yeah.
00:53:45 On the one hand, it was like, oh, I can't exactly do a Lord of Ghost nega slime pin
00:53:51 because that already exists from Endless War.
00:53:56 But it kind of, you know, I mean, it's him and it's the magical event.
00:54:04 Yeah.
00:54:05 But the Lord of Ghosts with the, with the like the shitty drawing version is really,
00:54:11 really funny to have as an enamel pin.
00:54:14 The, the, the.
00:54:16 It's a different.
00:54:17 Different.
00:54:18 I've said it before, but I really, really like the opening of the comic
00:54:23 with the sequence with all the pages is such a cool little,
00:54:28 it's a cool little, like what could you call it a set piece?
00:54:31 Can comics have set pieces?
00:54:33 It's a very, it's a very cool sequence.
00:54:36 An opening scene, I guess.
00:54:38 Yeah.
00:54:39 Sure.
00:54:40 Sure.
00:54:41 Yeah, dog.
00:54:43 Yeah.
00:54:44 I don't know.
00:54:45 I'm hyped.
00:54:46 I'm hyped to get mine.
00:54:47 Link in the description.
00:54:49 Get that fucking book.
00:54:50 Get that fucking, get the red man.
00:54:53 Pledge to the Kickstarter so that we can get the red man zine.
00:54:56 I want the zine.
00:54:57 I want the red man zine.
00:54:58 I always think it was, oh man, I think last time I said that, like,
00:55:06 I will never, I will never, like, dig back through the Twitter archives
00:55:10 to see those red man comics.
00:55:12 So the only way I'll ever see them again is if they get put in a zine
00:55:16 and sent to me in a book.
00:55:18 Yeah.
00:55:19 So it's the only way.
00:55:21 I think I talked about, I talked about how, like, it's funny that,
00:55:25 like, some of the comics suck.
00:55:27 Yes.
00:55:28 And the fact that they're printed will be like,
00:55:30 oh, maybe I talked about it on the stream.
00:55:32 Yeah, did we talk about it there?
00:55:35 I genuinely don't remember, like, what we talk about on an episode
00:55:38 versus what we talk about on the stream.
00:55:40 All the days bleed together.
00:55:42 I don't know what time of the year it is.
00:55:44 I don't know what day of the week it is.
00:55:46 I don't know where I am.
00:55:48 It's a, yeah.
00:55:49 Oh, God, I got to move.
00:55:50 Oh, God, I got to find a new house.
00:55:51 Oh, my God, I've only got, like, a month left.
00:55:53 Oh, fuck.
00:55:54 A negative Pog.
00:55:56 It's negative Pog.
00:55:58 It's Monka S, for sure.
00:56:00 It's Monka S, for sure.
00:56:01 No, I actually really got to get on that.
00:56:03 It's actually a little bit bad.
00:56:05 Wait, how close is it?
00:56:08 I have to move out at the end of July.
00:56:12 So it's about five weeks.
00:56:14 About five weeks from now.
00:56:16 Oh, shit.
00:56:17 Okay.
00:56:18 Yeah, I thought it was July now.
00:56:20 My time.
00:56:21 Oh, yeah.
00:56:22 I have three days.
00:56:23 I have three days to find a new house.
00:56:25 No.
00:56:27 I was saying, I don't know, I don't know.
00:56:32 Man, the place, the place I live is such a deal.
00:56:36 It's such a deal.
00:56:38 I've saved up.
00:56:39 I've been able to save money because the rent has been, like, nothing.
00:56:42 But now I have to pay, like, a real rent to live in, like, a real place.
00:56:47 And it's like, oh, God, fuck.
00:56:51 No.
00:56:52 I refuse.
00:56:54 I'm going to do what they did in the musical rents.
00:56:58 I'm going to just be like, no.
00:57:00 I won't.
00:57:01 I'm going to throw a riot over it.
00:57:03 I'm going to not pay rent, just like the movie rent, just like the stage play rent,
00:57:08 just like I didn't pay rent.
00:57:10 I'm going to find a new apartment, sign the lease, get moved in,
00:57:15 and then immediately be like, rent your strike.
00:57:19 No, eviction moratorium.
00:57:20 You can't kick me out.
00:57:22 Instantly.
00:57:24 What if I barricade the door?
00:57:26 Huh?
00:57:27 What are you going to do then?
00:57:28 Yeah.
00:57:29 I think it's still, I think the moratorium on eviction is still active.
00:57:34 It might vary state to state.
00:57:36 I don't, I feel like it was never really enforced.
00:57:39 So I feel like, I don't know, I wonder, I wonder what, I wonder what Carmen would do,
00:57:47 would just tell me to do if he was here.
00:57:48 Carmen was the guy who convinced me and that when we lived in that place with the landlord
00:57:54 and he was trying to kick us out, he was the one who was like, he has no legal grounds to kick you out.
00:57:58 Just, just stay here.
00:58:00 Just stay there and don't pay rent for six months.
00:58:02 They can't kick you out.
00:58:04 And he was right.
00:58:05 So I wonder, I wonder what he would do if he were, if he were in my position.
00:58:12 That guy has never, that guy always gives good advice about how to fucking get away with shit and then not pay for stuff.
00:58:20 Based, based Carmen for sure.
00:58:26 Anyway, I'm very stressed about that.
00:58:28 I don't want to be homeless.
00:58:30 That would be pretty bad.
00:58:34 No.
00:58:35 But it'll be fine.
00:58:37 It'll be fine.
00:58:39 To be homeless?
00:58:41 No, that would be super bad.
00:58:43 I just, I just, I just want to finish my game.
00:58:46 I just want to finish my fucking game, but there's no way.
00:58:49 It's, it's not going to be done.
00:58:51 It's not going to be done by the end of the month.
00:58:53 And I'm going to have to move my computer and I'm going to have to move my hard drives.
00:58:58 Oh my God.
00:58:59 What if my hard drives get damaged in the move and what if my files get corrupted?
00:59:03 Oh, definitely back them up to like one of those funny services.
00:59:07 I could probably, I could probably back it up some like Google, Google Drive or something.
00:59:13 Yeah, you probably, if it's a lot of stuff, you might have to pay the Google's premium and big amount.
00:59:20 It's not that huge.
00:59:21 No, I think I could fit.
00:59:23 I think I could fit.
00:59:26 I mean, if I needed more storage space, I could just make a new email.
00:59:29 All right.
00:59:30 Just make a new dummy email.
00:59:32 I think I have a bunch of like just extra email accounts that just have Google drives attached for me to back stuff up.
00:59:39 Stuff from like, I don't even remember.
00:59:42 That's what I've always done.
00:59:45 Let's make a, make a dummy email.
00:59:47 Just store a shit there and then forget about it.
00:59:52 Yeah, it's, the files are not that big.
00:59:54 The game maker files are, actually, I wonder, I wonder how big they are.
01:00:02 I'll probably tell you right now.
01:00:08 It is the game maker file for Phantoms Revenge is 50 kilobytes.
01:00:15 Nothing.
01:00:17 Nothing at all.
01:00:19 That's, that is nothing.
01:00:22 Yeah.
01:00:23 I mean, that, that doesn't include.
01:00:25 It's probably just all the logic.
01:00:27 No, it does.
01:00:29 It loads, it loads this, that and the other.
01:00:32 I was going to say that doesn't include like the assets and like the, but no, it does.
01:00:36 The game has, the game file has all like the sprites and the background and stuff in it.
01:00:41 Like those aren't saved in like a separate folder.
01:00:43 So no, that's, yeah, that's the size of the game is like 50 kilobytes, including all the art and stuff.
01:00:50 You know, low res, low res shit.
01:00:56 Oh, but I finished on the upside.
01:00:58 I did finish all of the patrons that requested a like a custom enemy because I like patrons suggest enemies.
01:01:05 I got through adding all of those in.
01:01:08 I think there were like 11 or 12 or something people that asked me to make a special enemy for them.
01:01:15 And some of them are really funny.
01:01:17 I'm looking at one right now and he's making me chuckle, but I'm not going to say what it is because it's, it's very goofy.
01:01:24 You know, it'll be, I want, it'll be a surprise, LeMau.
01:01:28 Hmm.
01:01:31 Good times.
01:01:32 I like doing, I like making sprites.
01:01:35 I like sprite work.
01:01:37 It's very, I think part of the reason why like that, like two week period just flew by without me even noticing was just because I find that kind of work enjoyable and I could just lose myself in it and just like making a sprite for that.
01:01:51 Okay, open it up, move pixels around.
01:01:53 Oh, it's done.
01:01:55 Oh, two hours are gone.
01:01:57 Oh, wow.
01:01:58 I didn't even notice.
01:02:00 It's fun.
01:02:01 It's, it's enjoyable.
01:02:03 I was just put on a fucking, put on fucking 10 hour, let's do 10 hour speed run of Final Fantasy six and just go to town.
01:02:13 And that's, and that's my day.
01:02:15 Day in the life.
01:02:17 Good times.
01:02:19 Huh?
01:02:20 I was just saying, it's just saying life sucks.
01:02:26 Yeah, bro.
01:02:28 True.
01:02:30 True.
01:02:32 Oh, no.
01:02:34 So place.
01:02:36 And that's it.
01:02:38 That's it.
01:02:39 That's it.
01:02:40 Hey, hey, I got some, I got some news.
01:02:42 What?
01:02:43 I got some, I got some news.
01:02:44 I'm going to be on a, I'm going to be on a podcast.
01:02:47 Can you believe it?
01:02:48 No, I can't.
01:02:49 Can you fucking believe it?
01:02:50 Who would invite Benson?
01:02:51 I've been invited, I've been invited to appear on Animorphin Time, the leftist Animorphs podcast.
01:02:59 Oh, cool.
01:03:01 Yeah.
01:03:02 Pretty cool.
01:03:03 All cops are Yerks.
01:03:06 Hell yeah.
01:03:08 I have to, I have to, I have to read the book.
01:03:11 I think I have to read.
01:03:13 I have to get like any knowledge about Animorphs.
01:03:16 I, Tyler from, from Animorphin Time messaged me yesterday to be like, when do you want to record?
01:03:23 And I didn't get back to him.
01:03:24 And now I can't see my Twitter messages because fucking Twitter's broken.
01:03:29 So I can't get back to him until they fix whatever's going on with their servers or whatever.
01:03:34 Sorry, sorry, Tyler.
01:03:37 Whoops.
01:03:39 I have to read, I think it's book number like 30 something.
01:03:43 It's a Tobias one, which is good.
01:03:48 It's past the point in the series that I had read up to, I think I read up to like number 20, like late 20s, early 30s, I think.
01:03:57 And then at some point I, that was about when I fell off.
01:04:01 I never finished the series.
01:04:02 So the one that I have to read for that episode is like post, it's past the point in the series that I stopped reading.
01:04:09 So I don't know, could be, could be interesting, could be pretty, could be pretty nifty, I guess.
01:04:15 I guess I'll, I'll link that when that episode comes out on Apple podcasts or wherever it was they publish them.
01:04:23 Oh, shit.
01:04:24 I just remembered I got an email about like, like a kickstart.
01:04:30 Oh, your Kickstarter is great.
01:04:31 And I was like, okay, I was going to ignore it.
01:04:33 But then they said, we do a podcast promoting people.
01:04:38 They didn't want me to be on, but they just said, if you want, you will promote your thing.
01:04:43 Looks cool.
01:04:44 Send us an audio clip of you promoting your thing.
01:04:47 And I'm like, I don't want to speak into a microphone.
01:04:51 But I also feel like there's no harm.
01:04:54 So maybe maybe it's like a, it's like a podcast about kickstart or like indie comics or something.
01:05:02 That's interesting.
01:05:04 I mean, I get, whenever I do a Kickstarter, I always get a bunch of like scam emails about it.
01:05:10 Yeah.
01:05:11 I saw like, the normal stuff is like, haha, we will get you pledges like shut up.
01:05:16 Yeah.
01:05:17 Yeah.
01:05:18 Sign up for a pay our advertising fee and we'll, we'll, we'll get the word out or whatever.
01:05:23 Yeah.
01:05:24 Oh yeah.
01:05:25 I found this other one like Olivia and William says greetings from myself and William.
01:05:28 My name is a will Olivia and my partner's name is William.
01:05:32 We are a duo expert crowd funders focus on seeing product projects get funded.
01:05:37 I would not want to impress you with too many words, but would rather let our results and
01:05:42 deliveries speak for us.
01:05:44 All you need to do is go through kickstartergoal.com, pay for a promotional package based on your
01:05:49 budget and desired funding go and see your project take a new turn.
01:05:53 Give us your credit card information basically.
01:05:57 Cool.
01:05:58 Like so obvious.
01:06:00 This other one.
01:06:01 Yeah.
01:06:02 Yeah.
01:06:03 Wait, I'm curious about Tyler, Tyler James from comics tribe and the comics launch
01:06:09 podcast.
01:06:12 Right now, comic book projects have a third highest success rate on Kickstarter.
01:06:16 The mission is comic, the mission of comics launch is to make comics number one.
01:06:23 So I'd love to get the word out about your project with a free plug in the new just launched
01:06:28 on Kickstarter segment of my weekly podcast.
01:06:32 What is the podcast called?
01:06:33 I'm kind of curious about it.
01:06:36 The comics launch podcast for the next comics.
01:06:39 The comics launch podcast.
01:06:44 Is it on YouTube?
01:06:45 Oh, no, I see.
01:06:47 It's got its own website, comicslaunch.com.
01:06:55 It's on Apple podcasts on Google podcasts.
01:06:59 I mean, what he's asking for is like go to comics launch for Boy To Smell, hit start
01:07:05 recording, and speak to it for about 30 seconds, hit send.
01:07:10 So I'm like, that's so easy.
01:07:11 I may as well try it even if it's like nothing will come of it.
01:07:17 Yeah, I mean, he's, hmm, I see he's he's he's posting podcasts on his website.
01:07:24 He's doing them like every couple weeks or so.
01:07:26 I, I, I don't, I wonder like what kind of an audience he has.
01:07:31 That's kind of neat.
01:07:32 That's kind of cool that this exists.
01:07:34 Doesn't look like a scam.
01:07:36 Doesn't sound like a scam.
01:07:37 No, I mean, it couldn't be if unless the comicslaunch.com slash voicemail asked me for my credit card
01:07:45 information again.
01:07:48 Yeah, the thing that I stopped like stopped myself from doing it already was like, I keep
01:07:55 failing at the elevator pitch for Lord of Ghosts.
01:07:59 I don't know what to say.
01:08:01 It's a comic.
01:08:03 It's about a lord is a little ghost guy and he's like, and he just wants to kill, but
01:08:10 he doesn't really want to kill.
01:08:12 Like, I don't know how to explain it.
01:08:14 It's the adventures of little ghost as he goes because there's, I guess you could say it's
01:08:21 just a, it's about a, I don't know about a little freaks wacky adventures.
01:08:27 Little freaks like adventures in a strange new land filled with mud instead of the familiar
01:08:34 slime.
01:08:35 It's like, I mean, yeah, that God, yeah, I don't know.
01:08:40 I don't know what you, what the elevator pitch for it is.
01:08:43 It's just to read my fucking comic.
01:08:45 It's funny.
01:08:46 It's funny.
01:08:47 It's cool.
01:08:48 Yeah.
01:08:49 I was reading it the other day and I was like, oh, you know what?
01:08:51 I like this.
01:08:52 I'm a fan of my own comic.
01:08:54 I forgot.
01:08:58 This is, I can't, I can't believe this.
01:09:03 Like I'm looking at comics launch and I'm like, why, why does this exist?
01:09:10 This, this guy just seems like he is just like, I want all comics to exist.
01:09:18 I will make all comics succeed on, if it's a comic, I will fucking do anything to prevent
01:09:25 its destruction.
01:09:26 I like it.
01:09:27 I don't know how, I don't know what's, what's, what's in it for this guy?
01:09:31 What's his angle?
01:09:32 Well, it could be potential networking, I guess.
01:09:38 He's talking with comics.
01:09:40 Like it maybe starts from a love of comics generally.
01:09:43 And then by promoting people, he can be like well known in the comics sphere.
01:09:50 Like getting, getting small indie comics off the ground.
01:09:53 People like are happy about his work that they helped him.
01:09:57 And then that helps him by word of mouth, I guess.
01:10:01 Maybe.
01:10:02 Maybe.
01:10:03 Cause I mean, we're talking about it.
01:10:06 What does he say?
01:10:07 He says, creators, Superman isn't coming.
01:10:11 So we get to save ourselves.
01:10:13 My name is Jay, is Tyler James and I'm one of thousands of creators who are doing things
01:10:17 differently.
01:10:18 We believe the creative life and career we want is not only possible, but inevitable.
01:10:22 If we're willing to work hard enough, smart enough and to commit, commit to bringing passion
01:10:27 to every project, commit to action even when it's scary, committing to building a network
01:10:32 and always adding value first, committing to doing things with integrity and keeping
01:10:36 the promises we make to others and ourselves, commit to never stop developing our talent
01:10:41 because we are all works in progress.
01:10:43 And we also believe that starving has nothing to do with being an artist.
01:10:47 While others are waiting for permission to get started or for approval from some gatekeeper,
01:10:51 we've picked ourselves and we're building our legacies.
01:10:54 One fan at a time, one project at a time, one launch at a time.
01:11:00 So serious.
01:11:02 It's just comics, bro.
01:11:04 It's just comics, bro.
01:11:05 It's not a big deal.
01:11:07 Fuck it.
01:11:10 I like him.
01:11:11 I'm going to give it a shot.
01:11:13 I'm going to figure out an elevator pitch.
01:11:14 I'm going to say it.
01:11:15 I'm going to send it in.
01:11:17 Oh, God.
01:11:21 I'm Flemme.
01:11:22 Why am I Flemme?
01:11:23 This is the image of him with his dog and there's a mug and the mug says, do what you love,
01:11:28 love what you do.
01:11:30 Well, words to live by, I guess.
01:11:33 True.
01:11:34 True.
01:11:35 He, he, it seems like, how come this guy didn't call me?
01:11:40 How come this guy didn't do, hey, this is, I can plug this guy in.
01:11:43 This guy never offered to plug the vapors.
01:11:45 Well, he's been saying that's why.
01:11:46 What is, what does Gib have that I don't have?
01:11:49 It's not right.
01:11:51 I have a better comic.
01:11:54 No.
01:11:56 I want to, I'm really curious.
01:11:59 Like, what is kind of following this guy?
01:12:01 I mean, maybe he only appeared recently.
01:12:05 He's, he's been, he's got his blog, the website blog goes back a couple years at least.
01:12:11 Oh, well, I don't know.
01:12:15 Maybe you, maybe you sifted through your spam emails and you just didn't see this one.
01:12:20 If you sent one to you.
01:12:23 Maybe.
01:12:25 Yeah, maybe.
01:12:27 That's interesting.
01:12:30 He, he just does, he's just like, he's just got a, he's just got spotlight.
01:12:35 So like, hey, these guys did a Kickstarter.
01:12:37 Hey, these other guys did a Kickstarter.
01:12:39 Hey, this comic came out through Kickstarter.
01:12:41 That was pretty cool.
01:12:44 Hmm.
01:12:45 How does he make, how does he monetize this?
01:12:47 How does he make money off this?
01:12:49 What's, what's, it's a, it's a front.
01:12:51 It's a front.
01:12:52 It's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a money laundering scam.
01:12:56 Maybe it's the only way.
01:12:58 No, you're jealous.
01:12:59 You're just jealous.
01:13:00 I got picked.
01:13:01 I am.
01:13:02 I am also that I'm jealous that you got picked for the money laundering scam.
01:13:06 Yeah.
01:13:07 What about me?
01:13:10 Based, based.
01:13:13 Do you want to go to voicemails?
01:13:16 Yeah, I got nothing else to say today, I guess.
01:13:20 I think I've said, I think I've said all I have to say.
01:13:23 Let's get into this horse shit.
01:13:26 If you go to speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail viewer, you can send us a voicemail and we
01:13:33 will re-respond to it in a disappointingly low energy sort of way.
01:13:39 That's what I'm going to do today because I'm, I'm under the weather and you're all just
01:13:43 going to have to deal with it.
01:13:45 I see the first voicemail here is called big chicken.
01:13:48 You see it?
01:13:49 Yep.
01:13:50 Okay.
01:13:51 In three, two, one, go.
01:13:54 Hello, PCP.
01:13:55 As it occurs to me during my intense play session of Neopets, that many of the people sending
01:14:04 voicemails to the channel should in fact invest in a new microphone because they all sound
01:14:12 like shit.
01:14:13 I mean, true.
01:14:15 Yeah.
01:14:16 In a perfect world, I would like everyone to have a great microphone and deliver crisp,
01:14:22 clear, 180 billion megahertz audio quality, but I have to accept the reality that you're
01:14:33 one of the good ones with a good microphone, big chicken.
01:14:37 We're down here in the muck and the dirt and the grime and the filth and it's okay.
01:14:42 It's all right.
01:14:43 I can take it.
01:14:45 The next voicemail is called a warning.
01:14:48 Three, two, one, go.
01:14:51 Yo, this is Mr. T.
01:14:55 Ben St.
01:14:56 You damn fool.
01:14:58 No, false.
01:14:59 Listen, I'm going to call a truce with y'all right now.
01:15:04 Since that summer I bastard being gone, I've been released from his mind control.
01:15:10 And I was going to go home and be done with this whole damn thing.
01:15:16 But first, I had to warn you.
01:15:20 Because when Mr. T came to, he was at the Kawasaki clan base.
01:15:27 And there's actually one more summer I left alive.
01:15:34 And he's got a vendetta against y'all.
01:15:37 Never ends.
01:15:38 Never ends.
01:15:39 Y'all going to be hearing from a new, even more powerful summer out very soon.
01:15:47 So good luck with all of that.
01:15:50 Thanks.
01:15:51 Mr. T, go home and fall ever.
01:15:54 Well, bye.
01:15:55 Thanks, Mr. T.
01:15:57 Goodbye.
01:15:58 We love you.
01:15:59 Have a beautiful life.
01:16:03 Have a good trip.
01:16:07 See you next fall.
01:16:09 Bam.
01:16:16 What do you think of the samurai is going to be like?
01:16:19 I think...
01:16:22 Oh, I can't even speculate.
01:16:25 The possibilities are just...
01:16:27 Did you ever give back the scroll?
01:16:30 Do you think they're going to be angry with the scroll, the same one?
01:16:34 Don't you remember on stream when we realized that in creating the void Thaumaturge's robe,
01:16:42 my Minecraft avatar has the scroll on it now?
01:16:45 Oh, of course.
01:16:46 You can literally see me carrying the scroll around.
01:16:50 It's part of my character design now.
01:16:54 Yep, it's that Thaumcraft.
01:16:59 I'm high on that Thaumcraft goodness.
01:17:03 The next voicemail is called From Collapsic.
01:17:06 Three, two, one, go.
01:17:09 Hi, Ben.
01:17:11 It's me.
01:17:12 Collapsic.
01:17:13 Yo.
01:17:14 You remember me?
01:17:15 Ben.
01:17:16 Yes.
01:17:17 And all the other soldiers?
01:17:18 Admiral Collapsic, I remember.
01:17:20 We missed you.
01:17:21 Ben, so very much we've missed you.
01:17:24 Oh.
01:17:25 We're just waiting here patiently.
01:17:27 I left you in a low light.
01:17:28 Are you to boot up your 3DS again?
01:17:32 Or your switch, if you can afford one?
01:17:36 Yes, we're just waiting for our chance to shine again.
01:17:43 Shine like pixie turkey.
01:17:44 Another Nuzlocke, Ben.
01:17:45 We need another Nuzlocke.
01:17:47 We need to prove ourselves as fine soldiers in your army, Ben.
01:17:53 Please quit the trilogy.
01:17:57 You know we need the trilogy to be completed, Ben.
01:18:01 Is it a trilogy?
01:18:02 We just, we're so lonely here with another Nuzlocke.
01:18:07 God, Jesus.
01:18:08 Laying it on a little thick, aren't we, Collapsic?
01:18:11 We just need one, Ben.
01:18:14 We need another Nuzlocke.
01:18:16 Is the pig coming?
01:18:17 Complete the trilogy.
01:18:19 What's the trilogy?
01:18:21 The trilogy.
01:18:23 Jesus.
01:18:24 This is me, Collapsic, and this is the way I talk.
01:18:28 Yes, Ben.
01:18:30 Okay.
01:18:31 We'll see you real soon.
01:18:34 Oh my God, my skin is crawling.
01:18:37 The, the, uh, yeah, I know I said, I have said that I wanted to do another Nuzlocke,
01:18:44 and I do, but I just, I gotta do, I gotta finish the game.
01:18:48 I can't, I can't do another one of those before I finish the fucking video game.
01:18:52 That's just the way it's gotta be.
01:18:56 Um, but I mean, thanks for the reminder.
01:19:00 Nice to hear from you, as always.
01:19:02 Glad things are going well in Alola.
01:19:06 You're taking care of business.
01:19:08 Good, good shit.
01:19:09 That's the lore.
01:19:10 That's the deep lore.
01:19:12 Next voicemail is called Please, 3, 2, 1, go.
01:19:17 Please keep talking about Tim Rogers.
01:19:19 Please make it a weekly sing.
01:19:21 I'm not joking.
01:19:22 There is not enough Tim Rogers discourse online.
01:19:25 I guess you've done at least some research on Tim by now, but he's been around for a long,
01:19:30 long, long, long time.
01:19:31 He had a whole arc where he went to be a game developer in Japan and had a noise band.
01:19:36 And look, honestly, Ben puts himself down too much.
01:19:39 Tim has put out so many reviews and they're insanely long.
01:19:42 He's easily written like 5 million words worth of game reviews.
01:19:45 This man has never fucked.
01:19:47 I have high hopes that he's never fucked.
01:19:50 He will reach this level of completely autistic content creation.
01:19:53 If you've read Backman, Tim here is like Nizuma Agee, a completely autistic,
01:19:59 turbo virgin that lives to work.
01:20:01 And by work, I mean waste everyone's time.
01:20:04 That is the ideal to strive for.
01:20:06 I know Ben, our dark hero, cannot be stopped.
01:20:09 Nothing can take him down.
01:20:10 The elves slide off him like Ponderwater.
01:20:13 He will never give up.
01:20:14 He will never give in.
01:20:15 He will reach the top.
01:20:17 And once he's there, a new generation of workflow's trash will look up and say,
01:20:21 fuck Ben St.
01:20:22 Fuck his little club.
01:20:24 Returns to Groves Ben St.
01:20:25 You asshole.
01:20:26 And you will look down and say, no.
01:20:30 True.
01:20:31 Who is Tim Rogers?
01:20:33 I don't think I was here when you talked about him.
01:20:37 Really?
01:20:38 He is a...
01:20:40 I'm shocked.
01:20:41 I'm sure you were.
01:20:42 He is a guy.
01:20:44 He worked for...
01:20:45 Okay.
01:20:46 I know a lot about him.
01:20:48 Just because he talks about himself a lot in his video game reviews.
01:20:52 But he is...
01:20:54 Now he has a channel on YouTube called Action Button where he has made like five really,
01:21:00 really long video game reviews.
01:21:03 Before he was doing that, he worked for Kotaku making videos.
01:21:09 And he is...
01:21:10 Yeah, you know, he was a game...
01:21:12 He worked for a game developers in Japan.
01:21:15 He was like a translator for a...
01:21:17 He was a translator for a Yaoi manga artist.
01:21:22 He was a...
01:21:23 Or he was just some kind of assistant.
01:21:25 He...
01:21:26 He's in a...
01:21:28 Oh god.
01:21:29 What else?
01:21:30 Yeah, he was...
01:21:31 I know he's been in a noise band.
01:21:32 He didn't...
01:21:33 He says his band was bad.
01:21:34 I don't know if any recordings of this music or anywhere.
01:21:38 He always talks about doing running, doing track when he was younger and having six pack abs.
01:21:48 He was a fashion model, I guess, for a while, which is like really weird.
01:21:52 That's a really strange detail because he's not like a...
01:21:55 He's not like a...
01:21:56 I mean, I guess he's kind of fit.
01:21:58 I guess he's like skinny.
01:21:59 He's not like a...
01:22:00 He's not really a fashion model looking kind of guy, but I guess he did that.
01:22:04 This guy has managed to get...
01:22:06 He's 42?
01:22:07 He's 42, yeah.
01:22:08 This guy has managed to get away with complimenting another person that I am envious of.
01:22:16 He has managed to get away with it without irritating me by implying that I, too, am great.
01:22:23 So, thanks for that, voicemailer.
01:22:27 Appreciate it.
01:22:28 I thought you meant...
01:22:29 Tim...
01:22:30 Tim Rogers complimented you.
01:22:32 No.
01:22:33 No.
01:22:34 No.
01:22:35 No.
01:22:36 I've been...
01:22:37 I've been...
01:22:38 Every week, for the last couple weeks, I keep complaining about, like,
01:22:41 I found this guy on YouTube.
01:22:43 I kind of like his videos, but he's not so great.
01:22:46 I could do what he does.
01:22:48 What's so special about him?
01:22:50 These are my gripes.
01:22:51 These are my gripes with Tim Rogers.
01:22:53 This guy says there's not enough Tim Rogers discourse, but what discourse is there to have?
01:22:58 I mean, the guy...
01:23:00 He just talks about himself.
01:23:02 He just talks about himself in his videos.
01:23:04 And that's why I know all about him.
01:23:07 There's nothing I can say about Tim Rogers that he hasn't already said about himself.
01:23:12 Looking forward to the next review, I guess.
01:23:19 The next voicemail is called Best Voicemail I've Submitted.
01:23:24 Sorry for the bad ones.
01:23:25 Three, two, one, go.
01:23:28 Hey, PCP.
01:23:31 Nah, actually, fuck it.
01:23:33 Yeah.
01:23:34 Yeah, dude.
01:23:36 Now, that's what I call a good voicemail.
01:23:39 Get in, get out, make your point.
01:23:41 Don't waste anyone's time.
01:23:43 Good job.
01:23:44 Next voicemail.
01:23:46 Oh, this one's gonna be good.
01:23:47 It's called the Ben St. Child molester.
01:23:50 This is gonna be epic.
01:23:52 All right.
01:23:53 Three, two, one, go.
01:24:04 What?
01:24:08 All right.
01:24:10 Thanks for the voicemail.
01:24:12 It sounded almost like it was real.
01:24:14 Like someone was actually driving really fast, but I don't think so.
01:24:18 Well, I mean, that guy...
01:24:24 There was a guy who would send us voicemails who would just rev his car.
01:24:27 He would just drive his car really fast.
01:24:29 And I was always scared he was gonna crash on voicemail.
01:24:31 It was gonna be horrifying.
01:24:34 I don't even know.
01:24:37 I don't even... I don't know what to say.
01:24:39 Good job.
01:24:40 Okay, the next one is called a physicist.
01:24:42 Do you see that?
01:24:44 Yes.
01:24:45 Okay, three, two, one, go.
01:24:48 There is a problem in physics.
01:24:50 We can't unite quantum field theory and general relativity.
01:24:54 So here is my question.
01:24:56 Do you quantize the gravity or gravitate or geometrize the quantum?
01:25:00 So which one? Choose wisely.
01:25:03 Ah, fuck.
01:25:08 Should we quantize gravity or geometrize the quantum?
01:25:14 You should quarkize gravity.
01:25:17 How should I know?
01:25:20 How should I know which one we should do?
01:25:24 I mean, gravity seems the Pythagorean...
01:25:31 I mean, if they aren't compatible, then you can't just do that, right?
01:25:38 Then you would be incorrect to quantize gravity.
01:25:44 If gravity isn't...
01:25:47 I feel like this isn't a question you can just be like, which one should we do?
01:25:51 Because if either one works, then you just do it.
01:25:55 But the problem is that it doesn't work.
01:25:57 I don't know.
01:25:59 Real question is...
01:26:01 Should you poopoo in the pee-pee?
01:26:05 You poopau-poop audition
01:26:18 Next voicemail is called Ben your alcoholism is slowly killing you part two three two one go
01:26:26 Told you so
01:26:29 Yeah, bitch
01:26:32 Did you know did you know that I was gonna be hungover this episode, how did you know?
01:26:40 Hey, who sent that then was it somebody watched you be drunk. I
01:26:44 Don't know. I mean it was sent four days ago, which was before I was I was drunk
01:26:51 so I
01:26:52 Mean I
01:26:54 Don't know. I don't they got you. I don't I guess they fucking got me. I think they got me by accident
01:27:00 I think that was an accidental L on my part, but but an L nonetheless
01:27:06 Next voicemail is called
01:27:09 Really real Riley three two one go
01:27:14 It's Riley, um, I I actually have no idea what Riley sounds like but this is my voice
01:27:19 It's me Riley

01:27:34 Begetting this sick cash flow we're making
01:27:38 Yeah, we're making we're making so much money right now because we sold
01:27:43 All of our possessions all all of our stuff all of Trixie's really big anime and my collection
01:27:51 That's right. We sold it for like
01:27:54 32 dollars
01:27:57 Which which I spent on weed and also we got rid of our house. So we don't have to pay rent
01:28:03 But we're not homeless shut up
01:28:04 We're just camping out inside of this Walmart parking lot in our super cool RV
01:28:10 Which you can't see cuz fuck you and this could have all been yours Ben
01:28:14 You kind of had a share in this but yeah, I'd be a bitch and say things. Well jokes on you
01:28:22 Fuck oh
01:28:23 Anyway, I gotta go there calling security on me or something
01:28:28 Smell you later
01:28:29 nerds
01:28:31 Obviously, I agree with the spirit of this of this voicemail. Obviously, I endorse its message
01:28:38 Oh
01:28:39 Yeah, I saw like Riley make fun of you for like doing making a brony game or something
01:28:48 on Twitter
01:28:49 No, no
01:28:51 Or it was like the X that account
01:28:53 That's a that's a dummy. That's like a fake account. How was it?
01:28:57 That's that's some that's some guy who runs like a fake account and calls himself yig studios to make fun of them
01:29:02 But decided to like call me a brony and make fun of me for being a brownie or something
01:29:08 I don't know why he felt the need to do that
01:29:10 But he well, I mean it was a big own. It was like a massive L you took
01:29:15 I did when people remembered that you were a brony once my my the diarrhea from that L was
01:29:23 Put put the other ones to shame
01:29:26 Yeah, yeah, that was that was such like a that was such like a deep cut like a blast from the past
01:29:31 I know it's been so long since anyone been like dude give up the like usually. I'm I'm
01:29:37 Historically been the guy who's like dude give up the pony shit, bro. The po the brony shit. It's kind of cringe, bro
01:29:44 Like it's I mean, I don't say it like that, but like to hear to hear someone say that to me
01:29:49 I was honestly just like that's it's bizarre
01:29:52 It brings me right back. It brings me right back to when like our bronies like allowed to exist
01:29:59 That's the discourse
01:30:01 Was a cringe to like ponies. Yes, but and who cares
01:30:06 Is it cring is it cringe to like ponies because as we all know being cringe is punishable by by exile exile at least
01:30:17 Yes, that was funny also
01:30:21 Just a reminder
01:30:23 Just reminds me of the of the message tricks. He sent me where she said
01:30:27 Riley's made me so many connections to big people with big money
01:30:31 And now you're never gonna get to have any of it the only me because you're too mean
01:30:36 And I guess I think it's funny because like she lives with her parents now
01:30:40 She's just moved back in with her parents. So I guess those are the big money connections that Riley made for her parents
01:30:48 Wait, is that real? I think so. I believe so. Yeah, she's in California and
01:30:56 Pretty sure she's where her parents are. So I mean that's that's God. That's like that. Why else would she be in California?
01:31:04 Was his father's day, you know visit your folks
01:31:07 Oh, but the other reason she'll be in California because Dick Masterson's there, I guess
01:31:12 He's living there and out of then that and then our hills. I
01:31:16 Don't know does he maybe he lives in there. Wait, Los Angeles. I don't I don't think I don't think Dick
01:31:24 Masterson is letting her crash on his couch
01:31:27 I don't know that would be pretty funny. I don't I don't see that happening
01:31:32 I'm pretty sure she's just living with her parents, huh? It's like our third parent
01:31:38 She wishes
01:31:42 Next voicemail is called failed relationships and flesh lights
01:31:48 Saucy, okay, three two one go. All right. Here's part two of my woman hate blog a thing
01:31:54 I gotta tell you something. Okay one thing. Well, first of all, I'm not trying to be disgusting

01:32:38 Okay, TMI it is. Okay. It's okay. All right. All right. Cool. Good voicemail. Yes
01:32:45 pussy rules
01:32:48 Uh
01:32:49 Bass thanks for the voicemail. Are we still listening to him? I did. Yeah, I'm over it
01:32:55 But I think I think I get the picture the next voicemail is
01:33:00 From tarbuck transom and it's a YouTube link. Okay, let's listen to it in three two one go
01:33:05 H bomber guy is wrong Ruby is good actually I the beneficent to tarbuck transom was in the audience of a recently published
01:33:12 Lecture about ruby that we filmed at nlokon it totally sold me on the show and actually watching it has exceeded the
01:33:19 Expectations set by the lecture. I know folks are on these parts like lectures. So I thought they'd want to know and
01:33:25 Anlokon I
01:33:27 Think though Simon did that it is Simon. I saw I did see
01:33:32 Simon posting this
01:33:34 Somewhere I saw it posted somewhere that they did a ruby lecture
01:33:38 I did see it and I have not watched it. So I I don't I I don't know. Oh, it's six and a half hours
01:33:46 Yeah, that's why I didn't watch it. It's six hours long. Yeah, but yeah, this is another
01:33:51 It's a ruby lecture. It I if that's out. I mean, I'm sure
01:33:56 That would be interesting to people. It's
01:34:01 Seems like the kind of thing that could that that a lecture could could work. Yeah, that's definitely good lecture material
01:34:07 I've I've I think I've watched like a first episode and
01:34:11 Like a few friends have like talked about ruby because they were a fan's bit and I said, ah, this is when it started getting shit
01:34:17 Look at how cool it was here and how shit it was here. I'm like, okay
01:34:22 interesting
01:34:23 But I watched the first episode and I wasn't really that into it
01:34:26 But the fight scenes are very very well like animated and choreographed
01:34:31 So there's that I I should I think I think I watched the H bomber guy
01:34:36 video about it and like the ruby is something and here's why the the deal the deal with it or the
01:34:44 The the the what I learned or what I think I learned about it is that it's basically made by a guy
01:34:49 Who's really good at animating fight scenes? Yes, and then they were like, I guess we should make a story about it
01:34:56 And like their writing is bad
01:34:59 But the fight scenes are cool. That's what that's my impression of it based on a little I've never watched any of it
01:35:05 I think I've heard that the the characters are good. I don't know
01:35:11 Writing ways. I don't know whatever fuck. There's a lot for it. Check out the fucking lecture in
01:35:19 Would it be better to watch like six and a half hours of ruby rather than the lecture about it
01:35:25 It's quite a lot. Oh, hmm. That's a good question. How much ruby is there?
01:35:30 entire
01:35:33 length of
01:35:36 Ruby
01:35:37 Use ask in Google. Yeah
01:35:40 How long is Ruby? Oh
01:35:43 No, don't do that to me Google
01:35:46 I
01:35:54 Can see the the volumes 16 episodes in volume one episodes very greatly in length
01:36:02 One eight fifteen and sixteen around eleven minutes long and all other episodes are split into approximately six minute halves
01:36:09 Oh, so you could that's not even that much
01:36:12 How long would it take you to watch all of ruby?
01:36:16 I'm I there's no number provided. I'm so I'm just reading like volume two features 12 episodes
01:36:23 12 to 15 minutes each
01:36:27 so
01:36:28 12 episodes 16 minutes in length
01:36:31 12 episodes 16 to 20 minutes in length
01:36:37 So that you could figure it out
01:36:38 But I it's like eight volumes and they've all got slightly different numbers of episodes and lengths
01:36:43 Do you I feel like you could get through to like volume three at least in six hours? Yeah
01:36:51 I see
01:36:52 well
01:36:54 cool, I don't know
01:36:56 Fucking link in the description if you want to check out Simon's PCP style
01:37:02 Ruby lecture, I guess I'll just take credit
01:37:05 PCP takes credit for the format any lecture that anyone ever does from now on on anything is a PCP style
01:37:13 It's the
01:37:15 What was the fine brothers thing they did a while ago when I tried to like?
01:37:19 Oh, right that like owned the the idea of reacting to things the reacts the like yeah
01:37:25 The like kids react elders react whatever like that you could you can pay us a fee to use the react format
01:37:31 And you'll be part of the fine brothers family or some stupid bullshit. No, yeah
01:37:36 Okay, next voicemail is called comrade Tarbuck transom three two one go
01:37:45 Ultimate programmer and the leftist Jordan Peterson your beloved Tarbuck transom here keeps calling us looking time ago in a town called
01:37:52 Kikapu there lived a game development studio called Westwood who made command and conquer and the red alert series
01:37:58 They were purchased by EA and then treated badly
01:38:01 The original team's refugees eventually escaped and went on to form a worker co-op called a super giant and made the game Hades
01:38:09 By playing the game. You are directly supporting socialism
01:38:13 Other worker owned games made by different people include dead cells disco Elysium tonight. We riot and the board game co-op only
01:38:22 Do you know of any others? I had a list in a website, but I can't find it again
01:38:29 Um, I didn't know that's interesting. I didn't know that about Hades. I didn't know that about disco Elysium
01:38:35 I did know that about tonight. We riot
01:38:38 That is pretty another reason to try and play Hades then I guess I
01:38:43 Already bought Hades a long time ago and then never played it because Noida
01:38:48 Could hook to me too hard
01:38:51 the
01:38:52 I'm I guess I'm just I'm surprised, you know, maybe I'm not that surprised
01:38:56 I think feel like if there's any industry
01:38:59 I feel like if any kind of like company was gonna be like worker owned it would be oh
01:39:05 Like a small indie dev studio God
01:39:07 I was talking to Munchie yesterday and he said and I agree that like good good end for Ben
01:39:14 Saint is like get a exact is work for one of those work for like some local like small
01:39:20 Worker owned like game game dev co-op. I wish I could find a group like that. That sounds so cool
01:39:28 Since I mean since I have to move and my rent's gonna go up
01:39:31 I've been thinking about what kind of a real
01:39:33 Real job could I get if only if only I could find something like that? It wouldn't be so bad
01:39:40 But it'll never happen it'll never happen my my my I'm not we're in the darkest timeline and I'm just gonna
01:39:48 Die in the gutter. It's fine. It's fine. Oh, don't worry about me
01:39:54 I mean, what if you made you what if you started one? How would you start a worker co-op?
01:40:00 What if you just said hey, I mean the PCP is basically a worker co-op. We all like own it together
01:40:08 So I guess just do it the same way we made the PCP
01:40:13 However that was
01:40:15 Uh-uh, duh, duh, you just get mage to start a Skype a Skype group
01:40:23 That's where all worker co-ops come from didn't you know I
01:40:28 Guess that yeah, we could technically do that online, but I think in person would be a lot easier
01:40:35 Sure
01:40:38 I mean, huh are you okay? And I need to get it. I need to get a drink. I'll be a second
01:40:44 Fine a few moments later
01:40:49 Sorry, I thought I could I thought I could hack it out
01:40:54 But I
01:40:56 Don't know. I just felt like I needed a drink for a while
01:40:58 But I didn't have a drink because I drank it all and then I need to go get one
01:41:01 You gotta have your drink and drink it too. I'm gonna not dive
01:41:07 Dehydration that's the one
01:41:11 Okay next
01:41:13 Next voicemail is called voicemail detective three two one go
01:41:19 Hey, what's up fellas? It's me the voicemail detective and I have discovered in my meticulous research that that guy
01:41:28 that called in towards the end the last episode with all his bullshit about
01:41:35 being the nuns and
01:41:37 did you being a father figure and
01:41:40 Max reviving Tarantino cast
01:41:43 That was definitely fucking Tommy J. And he knows good and well he is banned from the voicemail
01:41:52 No
01:41:56 This is a scream at the end
01:42:01 Okay, I'm I'm on the phone. I am calling 9-1-1. I have dialed 9-1 and I am ready to hit the final one
01:42:07 I just need his location. We need to have him arrested apprehended
01:42:12 He is he has violated. He has violated the terms of our arrangement
01:42:19 Retribution feels like a snitch moment. I don't want to like I don't like a applaud like snitchery. Oh
01:42:26 shit
01:42:28 That's true. I don't know. Maybe that voicemail was fine as far as I remember
01:42:34 maybe
01:42:36 Maybe cops are base though
01:42:38 No snitch snitching is cool. Remember your your traditional lifted values
01:42:45 Traditional anti for values. I smell a little red brown alliance
01:42:52 Wait, I don't know what that is
01:42:54 I think I think it's red red like communists, but brown like Nazi brown shirts
01:43:00 I think is the do a little nas we do a little nas Bolin
01:43:04 No, sorry. Sorry. It was a momentary insanity. No snitching leave Tommy J. Alone. He's uh, he's uh, he's reformed
01:43:14 So long as the voicemail is not terrible no beating need be required
01:43:21 Yes
01:43:23 Optional next voicemail is called Ben. You have hurt me three two one go
01:43:29 Okay, then what the fuck?
01:43:32 Yeah, first off you don't
01:43:35 Respond to the title of my voicemail as you can wear diapers at the beach Ben. Fuck you. I'm sorry be
01:43:45 You keep accusing me of doing pig noises. So I ain't going bitch
01:43:52 I don't I don't mean who are you?
01:43:55 I think they didn't realize your reference to the pig was not about what they were saying but instead about
01:44:05 Oh
01:44:07 Maybe yeah, I mean I guess if you don't know that there's a scary pig in the voice mails
01:44:13 You might be a little confused when I anticipate pig noises coming
01:44:19 Yeah. Hmm. Yeah interesting curious I apologize voice mailer
01:44:25 Next one is called give is a perfect angel three two one go
01:44:32 So last week you talked about like
01:44:37 How it feels
01:44:40 That's how it feels to be trans and like I
01:44:44 Guess forgive have you found a good YouTube video that like explain how it feels because like as a
01:44:51 Sysman, I don't get it. I don't
01:44:56 And this isn't a rude thing at all like I do not understand what changing your pronouns
01:45:02 Possibly dressing a little differently. I don't know what other changes you've made
01:45:07 Physically, but I don't understand
01:45:09 What that has done for your mental health or how that has helped your I don't and it's not a mean thing
01:45:15 I'm just very I mean, I don't I'm not like a psychologist. I'm not entirely sure why
01:45:21 It really made me just feel better
01:45:24 It was it was a lot of stuff in 2020 that I looked up
01:45:32 Like little bits here and there that are not like in on of themselves
01:45:37 Like smoking gun evidence or anything, which is why it was hard for me to notice
01:45:44 But just sort of I don't know gender dysphoria or whatever it is I have
01:45:49 causes like a blanket layer of depression and
01:45:54 It's just sort of
01:45:56 like
01:45:58 Society expects certain things of a man and I didn't want to do those things and therefore
01:46:04 I just felt like a failure all the time no matter what I did because
01:46:08 The the masculine ideal that I should strive for was just something I didn't want to do
01:46:14 so like
01:46:16 Succeeding was upsetting in a way and doing the other thing. It was just I don't know
01:46:22 I don't know what about my brain
01:46:25 Change changes or like how it works. I just know that I tried the the pronouns
01:46:33 And being referred to as a as a girl as a woman as a she it changed. I just made me feel better
01:46:42 It's it's very strange
01:46:46 I don't know
01:46:48 If you want like
01:46:51 Videos that explain it a bit better. I think Contra points does a lot of stuff about that
01:46:59 Yeah, it was mostly contra points a little bit of philosophy tube
01:47:02 Damn contra points is is good at what that's valid as fuck
01:47:07 You're being thanks. You're being so valid right now
01:47:11 Thank you. Yeah, I don't know. It's just I mean it take gender out of the equation and it's like
01:47:20 You've always lived your life thinking that you're supposed to have a mohawk and and you just keep shaving your hair like that
01:47:27 Because that's what you're supposed to do and then one day you said, you know what?
01:47:30 I'm just gonna have a different haircut and then suddenly you feel
01:47:35 Suddenly they don't let you use the bathroom anymore
01:47:37 Suddenly they don't like to use the different hairdressers or whatever. It's like
01:47:42 It just a change in your life
01:47:46 The you know you prefer
01:47:50 That's it. You just prefer it. I don't I there's no
01:47:54 There's no way to like quantify it more than you could quantify anybody's preference for anything
01:48:02 And it just so happens to be very socially
01:48:05 Socially
01:48:09 What's the word not stigmatized exactly just sort of like the social pressure to be masculine or feminine or to not be the opposite
01:48:19 Is is quite prevalent in in Western society or lots of basically everywhere
01:48:27 So it's more it seems more important or more like drastic. I guess it's it's basically the same thing
01:48:35 So, I don't know. I
01:48:37 Like it. I just like it. That's all I just I just think they're neat. I just think I'm neat
01:48:44 Okay
01:48:45 Good aunt. Thank you voicemailer. Good answer. I hope you're I hope your queries have all been addressed
01:48:53 query
01:48:54 Got them
01:48:55 Next voicemail is called ignore the end three two one go
01:49:02 Okay, last one
01:49:05 You guys talk about Homestuck a lot and I've never read it. Yeah, you give me a short concise pitch on why?
01:49:13 Like I know the discourse of it. I know the trolls. We've we've talked about it so much
01:49:18 What is so captivating about the story? Oh my god? I feel like also Ben
01:49:23 What comics of yours do I need to read to care about your game? Thanks? I love you care
01:49:31 Baby Ben
01:49:35 Okay, so ignore the end ignore the end. So it's okay. It's okay a few
01:49:40 the game is
01:49:41 Only relevant to slime and punishment the game is a part of the slime and punishment story
01:49:46 So you only need to read that one
01:49:48 If you don't read it, then it won't make any sense. What's going on in the game?
01:49:52 I mean, you could probably still play the game and it would be fine
01:49:55 But like this would be like what what is this situation that I'm witnessing who are these characters?
01:50:01 Well, I mean
01:50:03 If you wanted an elevator pitch for Homestuck, I can't give one to you because it's too
01:50:09 Difficult to do that
01:50:11 Maybe that gives you enough of an idea. It's just good. I mean, it's hard to explain
01:50:17 He's heard us talk about Homestuck. He should know
01:50:21 What I don't really know exactly what he wants here. I
01:50:25 Should I just just read it dummy?
01:50:29 Yeah, like you can't I can't give like a plot synopsis that explains Homestuck and why it's good because why it's good
01:50:36 It's like the premise of Homestuck is not why it's good. It's the
01:50:40 It's like the like weird and like funny and and very it's the journey
01:50:46 Specifically way that it explores that that concept. It's not the premise exactly
01:50:52 It's not like even the way it's told exactly
01:50:54 It's the journey you go on reading it and seeing everything that happens
01:51:00 Yeah, and I've like I've said a lot a lot of people like the trolls and and got into it like post act
01:51:08 three and four four for for me for me peak Homestuck is is act one
01:51:13 But a lot of people don't feel that way a lot of people think it only gets good later. That's fine
01:51:18 That's fine for some people. I guess well, that's exactly the thing is that the the comic shifts and changes
01:51:24 it's
01:51:26 It's focus so much
01:51:28 That it is like the journey of reading it and seeing where it goes with all the different things all the different threads
01:51:35 Yeah, and and how it chooses to explore them. So just yeah read it. There's real
01:51:40 There's really no simple way to explain why I like Homestuck. It's
01:51:45 That's why do you think I've taken you 300 episodes of a podcast to do explain it?
01:51:51 Oh
01:51:53 Flynn okay next voicemail is called. I am the captain of my life now three two one go
01:52:02 but a PCP got a
01:52:05 Question for you guys that can maybe become a discussion if you care to have one my question is
01:52:10 Have you ever regretted being a fan of someone or something in the long the long run or the long term?
01:52:16 Quick short context behind this question. I used to embarrassingly be
01:52:21 Pretty active listener of Trixie and all of her content
01:52:24 Should make those $10 vlogs in her side channel and just all this stuff every day
01:52:28 and I listen to it just out of force of habit and
01:52:31 I would consider getting like one day I'd be like I want to maybe become a teacher
01:52:35 You know and take my career in that direction and then maybe I saw like a Trixie vlog
01:52:39 She was like man fuck school. I failed college fuck
01:52:45 High school sucks. Yeah suck man, and I was like, yeah teachers probably suck because you know, they probably suck
01:52:52 Same thing for like the government. I'm thinking about getting a job like a government job. It pays well
01:52:56 It's it's up my alley. It's utilizes a lot of my skills, but Trixie is like the government is it's anarchy
01:53:02 And we need we need anarchy the government is a destructive force. Yeah, so I'm embarrassing shit like that
01:53:08 I kind of regret listing all those so you guys have any similar experiences
01:53:13 Yeah, I man. Yeah, I can
01:53:18 Yeah, I
01:53:20 Don't know that don't
01:53:25 That's unfortunate whether that's unfortunate if that affected your affected your your course in life a real choice
01:53:33 Yeah, I mean, I don't I can't think of any like
01:53:38 People I became like fans of I mean I watched a lot of Trixie stuff
01:53:45 Especially earlier on it's like I was watching all of it, but I never really took her advice as like
01:53:51 Gospel like I'm sure some of the younger fans of hers were yeah, cuz I was her friend. It was like oh like, you know
01:54:00 She's not always right. I
01:54:02 Cuz I'm sort of on the same level, but some people they get into that. Oh my god the the youtuber die. It's so
01:54:11 Beautiful a lot of radiant light. I can't not agree with it even like yeah
01:54:17 I can I can imagine I could fuck you up a little even if you say like hey
01:54:21 I'm not a role model. Don't don't like be like me which you know she would say that yeah
01:54:26 But but but still like you know a lot of people in the world want to be
01:54:32 Youtubers a lot of people like want to do that and they see someone doing that doing what they want to do and
01:54:39 I think even if you say don't I'm not a Roma a lot of people like be like oh, but I kind of I kind of want to be like
01:54:45 You you know like if you're being successful at a thing they want
01:54:49 They're probably gonna want to emulate you like why wouldn't they it it's gonna happen. It makes
01:54:55 Perfect sense. I I guess like it's weird cuz I don't feel like I regret any of the things
01:55:01 I was into when I was younger even if some of them are cringe
01:55:04 I suppose like like it's not really a regret worthy thing
01:55:09 Because my life wasn't completely turned around or ruined
01:55:14 Yeah, anything
01:55:15 Like I used to be a fan of dr. Wolf. I would watch I would watch his videos and be like, huh, you know
01:55:23 Insightful, but like I fell for the the I fell for the accent. I fell for like
01:55:28 The the sense he puts on of like oh, he's got a waistcoat. He must be smart
01:55:33 And I was just like, yeah, you know
01:55:36 Analysis bronies are cool. I well there. I I guess I
01:55:41 It's it's not like I feel like it was a terrible thing that I kind of like watched some of the cringier brony
01:55:49 People for a while like whatever
01:55:52 Yeah, I don't I don't feel I don't I mean
01:55:54 I don't feel like anything that I was into like really did me harm or or anything
01:55:59 There's nothing that I'm like, oh, if only I had never gotten to that
01:56:02 I wouldn't have you know done something or other
01:56:05 I mean, I guess I were I kind of regret that I was a big Harry Potter fan growing up because I don't like JK
01:56:12 Rowling anymore
01:56:14 And I kind of feel this. Oh man. I mean, I maybe the worst one is that I used to read ruches
01:56:20 Blogs and ruches a is a horrible horrible human being
01:56:24 I didn't know at the he wasn't he didn't used to be quite as bad as he is now
01:56:28 You know, you know who that is right the pickup artist guy. Oh
01:56:32 No, well, he he was a pickup artist guy now. He's like he's just like a fucking
01:56:39 Now he's just like a fucking social commentator. He's a down guy trad trad calf like fascist man
01:56:46 Just like he's he's the worst human. He wasn't always quite so bad
01:56:54 But boy, I'm like, it's it sure is embarrassing to be like, yeah, I used to I used to read that guy's blog
01:57:00 I bought one of his books
01:57:03 But it's it's true
01:57:05 So but I wouldn't I don't say if I regret it because it didn't like
01:57:09 Didn't do me any harm and like sure some of the stuff see he made he was he was edgy
01:57:15 But I never like took any of his edgier statements. That's seriously
01:57:18 I don't feel like it it made me a worse or even much edgier person
01:57:25 Maybe I mean when it comes to like Harry Potter like I still like
01:57:30 At least the games the games are like treasured memories didn't didn't turn me into a turf. So, you know, I
01:57:36 It's fine. That's J.K. Rowling sucks, but we all know that
01:57:42 Yeah
01:57:44 So so I guess not really I guess there isn't really anything that I regret being into that much
01:57:53 Even even stuff that like I look back and I think oh that was pretty bad actually like whatever
01:57:58 It's not bad. It's not bad that I used to like something that is bad
01:58:02 It's character building character building. That's right
01:58:06 Next voicemail is called politic question three two one go
01:58:14 Short question voicemail for this week PCP sort of similar to another voicemail I sent this week
01:58:19 But what are your general thoughts on the government?
01:58:22 What do you think it's kind of a broad topic?
01:58:25 But if you could sum it up, what do you generally think about the government?
01:58:28 What do you think the role of the government should be in people's lives and
01:58:33 The state of the government currently do you think there's departments that should be
01:58:38 Sized down or removed from power. Do the government should be expanded. Do you have any general thoughts on I have for discussion next
01:58:46 I have been thinking about this
01:58:48 lately, I have been seeing people saying that
01:58:52 Anarchists are just liberals and I'm
01:58:56 Part of me thinks that I understand why they say that and I've been I've been thinking like I
01:59:03 Don't know. What am I am I am I am I am I an anarchist or am I a communist?
01:59:07 I'm I'm definitely one or the other and I guess you can technically be both, but I guess
01:59:13 In my I'm like stupid. I'm like stupid. I don't understand anything
01:59:16 But when I hear those words
01:59:17 I think an anarchist would want no government and a communist wants the government to
01:59:23 Do stuff and like take care of stuff
01:59:26 And give people stuff and redistribute wealth, which I do want it to do that
01:59:31 I
01:59:33 Think I might I think I'm I think I'm I don't know
01:59:37 I think I do kind of want I
01:59:41 Mean obviously the government we have now is imperfect and I wouldn't authorize like the government as it exists currently
01:59:47 Now has the authorization to do everything that would be bad
01:59:51 But I do think that in a perfect world. Yeah, the government would control a lot of stuff
01:59:56 That would just make life easier for people and like just offer everyone in the world
02:00:03 It's the essentials, you know food clothing housing healthcare education and just
02:00:12 Yeah, I want the government to do lots of stuff for free
02:00:17 Maybe that means I'm not an anarchist
02:00:20 But yeah, and yet I don't like all the anarchists that I know all the people that I know that call themselves anarchists
02:00:26 They all see they're all pro, you know universal health care and all that stuff. I
02:00:31 Guess I don't fucking understand anything
02:00:35 Yeah, yeah, I don't know terms quite that much
02:00:40 I think closest I would maybe call myself a socialist
02:00:44 But like what kind of socialist I'm not even really sure what the terms are
02:00:48 I know certain things that I like when it comes to government
02:00:54 I the I mean the UK government is
02:01:01 It sucks
02:01:02 But I'm not like well read enough or like knowledgeable enough about how it sucks to explain
02:01:07 I just don't like Boris Johnson or the Tories and
02:01:11 I don't like the the media machine that like demonized Jeremy Corbyn
02:01:17 But by you know, like it all pushed that the anti-semite thing so that people wouldn't vote for him democracy
02:01:23 It's it's so heavily swung by just whatever people end up being able to say on the news and it sucks
02:01:32 I
02:01:34 Think the government
02:01:36 It should exist. I don't think you should be completely gone
02:01:40 Mostly because I don't know how you could organize things
02:01:45 Without one, but I obviously think the the government's
02:01:49 Power shouldn't be like
02:01:54 Like from one person more democracy within the government I suppose
02:02:01 Yeah group groups of like a representative from each place
02:02:05 I don't know. I don't really know how it works right now, but I know that it doesn't work
02:02:10 You know, they they say like um
02:02:14 Socialism is about like democratizing everything, right? Like even the it's not democratizing everything
02:02:20 Work democratize work
02:02:22 Who is not one guy at the top of any given system that like scrapes a little off the top for himself
02:02:29 as extra free profit for no labor
02:02:33 It's it's all like everybody works together to make everything work
02:02:38 Yeah, and people would say oh well
02:02:41 What if people don't want to do it, but I don't know it's the same as everything I
02:02:46 Think yeah same as you people the government should provide free basic living standards
02:02:52 So the people don't die people have somewhere to sleep if they need it
02:02:55 I mean, I feel like the food all that stuff the government should exist too and like people say I
02:03:02 Understand there's a difference between like the state and the government and like the state is bad
02:03:06 But like government is good in theory at least government is like just people organizing as a tool
02:03:13 Yeah, government is just people organizing to like
02:03:16 You know fucking accomplish things. It's sort of like a big union if you think about it
02:03:23 kind of or it could be
02:03:25 you know
02:03:27 Ideally a government it gives it it
02:03:30 It you know it could collects it collects, you know resources from you know the
02:03:36 accumulated from the aggregate like production of
02:03:40 Civilization you know everyone's working everyone's doing stuff making stuff government collects that stuff and then redistributes it in the form of you know
02:03:48 free services or
02:03:50 Housing UBI what whatever form reach redistributive
02:03:55 Justice I guess
02:03:57 Is a good and also and I mean also as a check against like private
02:04:03 power right like monopolies right like
02:04:06 Jeff Jeff Bezos gets more money than the government
02:04:10 And is more powerful and can just buy the government right it can just lobby the government to be like oh do this do that
02:04:15 And it's like well, you know ideally the government exists to be like well
02:04:20 Actually, it's illegal for you to have that much money because you're just one person and that's bad
02:04:24 So we're breaking your fucking company up, and we're gonna shoot you
02:04:30 Yeah, I
02:04:32 Know yeah, it's so difficult at least in the UK is that
02:04:38 so much of politics is run by ministers who are
02:04:43 funneled through like the
02:04:46 upper-class like a
02:04:49 Super-rich eaten school and then Oxford and Cambridge
02:04:53 Really expensive schools where they are told you will be a minister you will be a politician
02:04:59 Because you have all the money and you can just do that because you got the you got the degree and being the prime minister
02:05:05 Now you're the prime minister well done, and then they have no reason they have no incentive. They have no idea that
02:05:14 They should
02:05:16 Stop that system from funneling their own children through the same super-rich
02:05:21 Highway to politics. Yeah, because it worked because it worked for them the system work for them
02:05:26 Yeah, it works for them like it, and they just they actually just
02:05:31 It's it's weird to think that they view the like it's a human being and they're viewing other human beings as
02:05:39 Disposable and trash and nothing and so that seems like super villain stuff
02:05:42 But I it just has to be true by based on their actions
02:05:46 They just don't think of poor people as deserving of life or or needs being to be met
02:05:53 They only do it in the pursuit of continuing to be in power if it's not good PR then they wouldn't bother
02:05:59 hmm, I
02:06:00 Mean, I guess that you gotta you got you gotta maintain your power so that you can do
02:06:06 The things that you might tell yourself are good and for the good of everyone
02:06:11 Right, but like if you lose your position if you lose the votes or whatever then you're out, and then you can't do it
02:06:17 So whatever whatever it takes, right?
02:06:22 Yeah
02:06:25 The next voicemail is called gaming
02:06:29 Smiley face, okay three two one go
02:06:33 Hey PCB on a tone Jones here
02:06:36 Tom is on this week, but the rest of y'all may be familiar with the new guilty-gear game that just came out
02:06:41 I was just wondering if y'all had any thoughts on that be it based on story gameplay or whatever
02:06:46 I at the at that the gaming cafe that we went to they were they had a big like seating area and they had big
02:06:54 Monitors in like a central area, and they were playing people were playing guilty-gear stride strife, right is the new one
02:06:59 I don't know. I've never heard of such a thing never heard of I think they have the new guilty gear
02:07:04 It's called guilty gear strife
02:07:06 I think and my opinion of it is that I don't play fighting games, and I don't care and
02:07:11 I'm sorry
02:07:12 Everyone seems really into it, and that's great, but I am not interested in seeing more drawings of May on my
02:07:20 Timeline, I don't care that she has a pirate hat
02:07:24 I'm just it's whatever
02:07:27 Yeah, it's fine the day. I care about a fighting game is the day I am Tom Oliver
02:07:33 Mmm, and not a second before and that's today. Oh
02:07:38 No, it shows you the sign that turns you into Tom Oliver when you read it. Oh
02:07:45 Somebody could maybe make a
02:07:48 Version of the sign that makes you like they could make that if they get a clip or an image of Tom looking at the
02:07:55 The board for the guilty-gear lecture or the animos one
02:07:59 Yeah, it could easily be realized
02:08:03 But do we dare? What do we dare though?
02:08:07 Oh
02:08:09 Yeah, I forget everything Tom said in the guilty-gear lecture. I remember pauging, but I don't
02:08:17 I wonder I wonder if that's like exploding in views now because of the new game
02:08:23 I'm sure it does. It's been doing well
02:08:26 You know, I mean I can I can find out I can find out right now

02:13:17 And by priveting everything the playlists are also gone
02:13:21 I mean all the videos. I mean a lot of the videos are still there because they weren't all on Trixie's channel
02:13:26 the
02:13:27 the I'm did
02:13:29 You think you think the playlist was made on on Trixie's channel. I mean, I can't remember who made it

02:14:37 But they could have done something funny like like me and tell more each of your arms or something
02:14:46 Pandaman Pandaman post post here that says
02:14:51 The PCP has a real art preservation problem
02:14:54 Many members take down old videos and the vast majority of their old videos in some cases. How is this okay?
02:14:59 Yeah, that's for it. I agree. I believe in our preservation, but I can't
02:15:04 Oh, we haven't we haven't deleted. Uh, well
02:15:07 Never what I haven't deleted anything. I'm doing my part
02:15:12 Do someone unit number 2278 asked guys who are the current members of the League of Nate fuckers?
02:15:20 You must need to know for lore. I don't need them all but the more you can name the better because I don't remember a single one
02:15:26 Thanks in advance
02:15:29 Your boy Cthulhu zero comments
02:15:33 Your boy Cthulhu says important sources for PCP history. It's like this guy is looking for
02:15:40 looking for
02:15:42 for for for
02:15:45 Knowledge secret knowledge. Okay, I'm gonna stop reading it now
02:15:49 But I it's cool to see people up post in there and actually like voting on stuff and be it's neat
02:15:54 Me me me stumbling upon the subreddit while trying to find out what happened to the Homestuck podcast
02:15:59 I was listening to and it's the it's the funny gif
02:16:03 where you know
02:16:04 Where he goes in with the pizza and there's everything's on fire
02:16:08 mmm. Oh
02:16:10 Yeah, it's uh, yeah Troy
02:16:13 I'm trying to find out what happened to the Homestuck. Is is is he talking about arm retrieval?
02:16:17 I'm assuming so like arm retrieval scone. I wonder what's happened then looks into it. Oh, no
02:16:24 Oh, oh look at it a month ago. Henlo Corgo posted PCP is even better now to be honest
02:16:31 The episodes are about as focused on a specific topic as they everywhere
02:16:34 And the fact that every episode doesn't have four or more people talking over each other arguing
02:16:37 Which makes them easier to listen to and enjoy
02:16:39 Woo
02:16:45 I like it if you listeners if you if you are a if you're a if you're a lay epic redditor
02:16:51 And you haven't seen it. I mean go check out the fucking PCP subreddit. It's uh
02:16:59 It's not super active, but there's there's posts. There's real posts on the internet
02:17:06 Uh, yes next voicemail is called PCP bad comments award show number 267
02:17:13 three two one go
02:17:15 Coming to you pre-recorded from an undisclosed location. It's the PCP bad comments award show
02:17:24 Woo, thank you. Thank you. I've got a great show for you tonight. Now, please welcome tonight's special guest playmaker
02:17:35 Woo
02:17:38 I love that note playmaker you're tonight's winner of the award for the worst comment of episode
02:17:44 267 would you mind giving us a recitation? We have it for you on that card there
02:17:49 Ben becoming a calmer really was he harambe everything change in the timeline for the PCP
02:17:56 Thanks for coming on playmaker tune in next week same pcb time same pcb channel
02:18:02 Really really was he harambe?
02:18:05 Uh, uh, I gotta find the pro crastinators
02:18:11 podcast
02:18:13 So it's happened so first. I didn't know when he started saying the comment comment
02:18:20 Uh, so it's also sort of blended into his own speech. Oh wait, I was from 267
02:18:26 That was from 267 not 268. Uh, are you really gonna go find the comment?
02:18:31 I just it's
02:18:33 What does he mean? What does he mean me becoming a commie? Was he harambe?
02:18:39 Oh, here's it was was the harambe
02:18:41 Maybe they mean his harambe moment
02:18:44 I think maybe what it means is that like when harambe
02:18:49 Was killed that was like when we branched into the dark timeline and everything started going wrong
02:18:53 I think I think that's the implication here
02:18:56 Uh, okay. Oh, we can understand more if we listen to the next voicemail
02:19:00 PCP bad comment award show meta post three two one go
02:19:06 Ben

02:19:14 There are people whiting about the pcb being different every single week
02:19:18 I'm only gonna ban people that say nothing
02:19:22 Constructive at all, but just be like
02:19:24 Just end the show guys guys the show's not like it used to be just end it

02:20:00 Uh next voicemail is called the three. I don't know what that means three two one go
02:20:10 Hi so
02:20:14 Hello
02:20:16 Hello
02:20:18 Is the question about how much
02:20:20 Ellie is our cuts out. Is it mainly just moments where
02:20:24 No one's speaking for an extended period of time or is it
02:20:27 Or are there actual like chunks of
02:20:30 Conversation being cut out
02:20:32 Ellie is our cut out that long pause that he put in that the one that voicemail
02:20:37 Uh
02:20:39 No, it's pretty rare that we actually cut out like actual conversation. Generally. It's like generally it's like um
02:20:47 Just someone like you you went to get a drink before and I said Ellie is our cut out the silence
02:20:53 Yeah, that's usually it. Uh, or if
02:20:57 I don't know if we said something uh
02:21:00 Devastatingly bad and we like oh, we're gonna cover this up. It's good a little watergate
02:21:05 And let's say cut that out
02:21:07 Yeah, if if I'm if it's something if like someone says something that's like sensitive information
02:21:12 It's like now. I don't want to say that Ellie is our cut cut the part
02:21:15 But that like almost never happens. It's happened like once or twice
02:21:19 Uh, generally it's just silences
02:21:21 Or if there's like a voicemail, that's like particularly bad and we're like we just don't want to play it
02:21:25 Uh, then it'll just be like Ellie is our just cut that out and pretend like it wasn't there that also pretty rarely happens
02:21:33 um
02:21:34 Next voicemail is called le power tools three two one go
02:21:39 You know, I fucking power tools to make furniture. I did it myself with a hammer and nails
02:21:44 So I was like, I don't know fucking seven or some shit
02:21:48 Like and how was it how was the chair that you made when you were seven functional a person can sit on it
02:21:53 So therefore, uh, you're wrong benny boy
02:22:01 I think there's something about like tarbuck transom said just build your own furniture
02:22:04 And then we were like but we don't want to do that because it's all of the things about it
02:22:09 I including having to get tools and it's like no just get a tool
02:22:14 It would be really just get a single tool
02:22:16 I mean, I'm sitting at a at a at a desk with a drawer in it
02:22:20 I like having a desk with a drawer in it. It would be really hard for me to build a desk with a drawer in it
02:22:28 um
02:22:29 I would I'll just fucking buy one. I don't know
02:22:32 Hey, so my you could my parents gave me this one. You could carve a desk with a drawer
02:22:37 um
02:22:38 In it out of a larger desk with a larger drawer in it
02:22:41 Uh

02:23:41 Like right there's
02:23:43 It doesn't really tend to veer off in like new directions that like I need to point out like what are my thoughts on them? Yeah
