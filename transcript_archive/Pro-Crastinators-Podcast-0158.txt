00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:05 Ready Phantom? Oh my god!
00:00:07 We did it ladies and gentlemen. Hey it's not a T-Bap show, everybody watch Come On Let's Go Pro Crastinators.
00:00:12 We actually made a fucking podcast. Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
00:00:16 And today we've got me, the best guy ever, in addition to some lower life forms including Munchy.
00:00:23 Do these count as a map of us? I mean technically you did like release a video.
00:00:28 Absolutely not. It's got to be on my channel.
00:00:31 Well it's got to be on my platform.
00:00:33 Well I guess you guys are going to be watching this episode on a different channel.
00:00:37 Yeah when Nate finally stages a violent coup it's just going to be like the channel will just vanish overnight
00:00:42 and then he will have hundreds of pieces of content to just re-release on his channel and we'll all be powerless to stop him.
00:00:48 It's the big brain play honestly.
00:00:50 We should definitely talk about that because that's crazy shit. I think this is the first episode.
00:00:54 Yeah it definitely is since that happened so we'll get to that later but there are more people.
00:00:58 Tom, Tom is here of course.
00:01:00 I need more soul.
00:01:03 Where are you going to get him?
00:01:07 From the shoemaker.
00:01:09 That sounds like a man bereft of soul poops.
00:01:11 You're going to kill all of you fucker.
00:01:13 No not me.
00:01:15 Oh there it is.
00:01:17 I am a weak boy. I am a mere hollow sir.
00:01:21 What do they call a shoemaker? Not a haberdasher.
00:01:24 A cobbler.
00:01:25 A clogmeister.
00:01:27 A cobbler.
00:01:29 Dude I straight up got my feet measured by a cobbler once.
00:01:32 Dude that's straight up.
00:01:34 Dude you get your fucking boots blacked?
00:01:36 Yeah I got them fucking shine dude.
00:01:39 I got them shine all the way to the ideal.
00:01:43 You engage in some boot blacking as featured in my favorite webcomic Ojoi sax toy.
00:01:48 I fell apart immediately upon standing up and walking outside and you didn't give me my money back.
00:01:53 And of course we also have the furtive hippocrite.
00:01:56 The furtile hippocrite.
00:01:58 Oh yeah.
00:02:01 Listen I don't want to make the pockets weird or anything but like I'm just imagining my children being bred by hippo and I'm just trying to get a little bit weird right now.
00:02:09 Being bred? Like putting the fucking pizza oven and cooked?
00:02:12 Yes.
00:02:13 I'm like fully breaded dude.
00:02:15 Hey you forgot me but that's okay I'll introduce myself.
00:02:18 I slipped it in. You had said some words.
00:02:20 What's up guys? Best guy ever here.
00:02:22 No wanted sex criminal.
00:02:27 I don't know about wanted.
00:02:29 Back at it again from the Pizza Hut where I'm laying low from the feds.
00:02:32 I'm obligated to inform you that I am a sex offender.
00:02:37 If I'm to be on this podcast.
00:02:39 I have a zero rating on the social credit score.
00:02:41 Hey speak of that Pizza Hut Nate.
00:02:43 Do you want me to tell us what that really strange thing you said before we started recording?
00:02:49 Child sucks cult underneath your pizza?
00:02:52 Do you want to explain that on the show?
00:02:54 I think we better save that for the bonus episode.
00:02:57 I think we better keep quiet about that and let the fans speculate.
00:03:01 Before we do anything I have a bone to pick with Nate.
00:03:06 Oh don't we all.
00:03:08 I gotta air my grievances because before this podcast started.
00:03:11 This guy thinks he's got the only bone with Nate to pick.
00:03:14 I'm just gonna be just trying to repeat it.
00:03:17 I was awake all night playing Dark Souls 3 because I have no light.
00:03:21 I listened to all of Matthew Muteau's Dark Souls 1 commentary.
00:03:26 It was pretty cool and then I needed something else to have his noise while I was playing it.
00:03:31 Oh no not the lowly Mia Mathifa.
00:03:34 Mia Mathifa came out and I was like I'll just start listening to that.
00:03:37 I got like 15 minutes into the Devil May Cry 5 Mia Mathifa.
00:03:40 I'm like this is the most retarded take I've ever heard.
00:03:43 It's not even a take.
00:03:45 It's a deliberately incomplete take as a man struggling with the reality
00:03:50 that he has not found himself attached to the way that other people do to Devil May Cry.
00:03:54 I had to roll my eyes.
00:03:56 I audibly rolled my eyes.
00:03:58 I'll let you figure out what that means but I audibly rolled my eyes
00:04:01 when you were just like Devil May Cry 3 man I don't even understand.
00:04:05 What's the Temina Gru? I don't even fucking get it.
00:04:08 I haven't seen this video.
00:04:11 I'm thinking this man, the man who sat us down for three hours
00:04:15 and had to explain the difference between the Keyblade and the Keyblade
00:04:18 is complaining about the Temina Gru.
00:04:21 You don't have any ground to stand on sir.
00:04:24 It's just a matter of personal commitment to like how much have I investigated one verse.
00:04:28 It's the fucking tower. The tower is the Temina Gru.
00:04:31 There you go.
00:04:33 I haven't watched this video but I have seen multiple people in multiple discords
00:04:38 complain about your takes on Devil May Cry.
00:04:42 I'm glad I can air that publicly now.
00:04:45 I know you haven't played many of the games or you're not like that into it.
00:04:49 I actually have played all of them as a matter of fact.
00:04:53 He's just an idiot. I don't know what to tell you.
00:04:56 It reminds me of the backlash I got for being like
00:05:02 for the Heroes of Might of Magic videos I made
00:05:06 where like I had no idea, I mean, you know, big mistake
00:05:10 to make a video where I wasn't like super fan of the games
00:05:14 and I talked about them and people ripped me to shreds in the comments constantly
00:05:18 about my lack of knowledge on this cult classic that everybody knew about.
00:05:23 That's kind of sad though because like the interesting thing about those videos
00:05:28 was like you were someone coming into them not having that background
00:05:31 backlash take. Here's how someone would experience them today.
00:05:34 And like that's cool.
00:05:36 It's just that I didn't expect backlash because I didn't know about it
00:05:43 and if I knew that there was like a big fan thing
00:05:48 I probably wouldn't have put my opinion out there
00:05:51 because I don't like getting told I'm an idiot.
00:05:54 So I probably would have waited until I had more of an understanding
00:05:59 of what I was talking about.
00:06:01 Frankly, like that video was designed to be kind of a parallel
00:06:04 to the Hollow Knight one I made for me a mouthful one.
00:06:07 And like, I mean, again, it's not like a genius take or anything.
00:06:10 It's just like basically my first exposure to this particular game
00:06:13 and looking back on that like Hollow Knight video,
00:06:16 I'm sure people, if they watched it now,
00:06:19 look, no one's a bigger Hollow Knight fan than me
00:06:21 and I like barely understand what's going on in that game
00:06:25 and I'm fumbling around and I'm quite critical of Hollow Knight
00:06:28 and now it's like my favorite game of the...
00:06:30 I mean, before Sekiro, it's definitely my favorite game
00:06:33 of the last like five, six, seven years or something.
00:06:35 So that's what I was kind of hoping people would take away.
00:06:38 We'd be able to look back at it as like a landmark
00:06:41 in Nate's journey of trying to finally understand
00:06:44 what people love so much about Devil May Cry.
00:06:47 You know what would work about a video like that?
00:06:49 If it was a video where you start the video, not getting it
00:06:54 and then you...
00:06:56 And then I get it at the end?
00:06:57 Well, yeah, because like there was this...
00:06:59 It only played two hours.
00:07:00 James Rolfe did this thing where he was like,
00:07:02 I've never got into Power Rangers before.
00:07:04 I want to know what it's all about.
00:07:06 And then he basically...
00:07:08 It's just sort of an explanation of him beginning,
00:07:12 like not knowing anything, being an idiot,
00:07:15 and then he marathons the whole thing
00:07:18 and then he comes back at the end.
00:07:20 A lot of that kind of time.
00:07:21 I mean, it was James Rolfe. He's crazy.
00:07:23 So he marathons the whole thing and he gets it
00:07:26 and then he has like a big like, oh, this is so great.
00:07:29 And the people who would otherwise have been annoyed at him
00:07:34 loved it because it is living proof
00:07:38 that you can get into this thing.
00:07:40 And then they could share that to their friends like,
00:07:42 see, Power Rangers is good.
00:07:43 This is why you should try and get into it.
00:07:45 So Power Rangers, American Power Rangers
00:07:48 was actually thought to be good by James.
00:07:51 Is that accurate?
00:07:52 Because he's always pretty childish to me.
00:07:54 I mean, I watch it when I'm a little kid.
00:07:55 Well, it's super childish.
00:07:56 But like, that's its charm.
00:07:57 Its charm is just funny, goofy.
00:07:59 Like, I think that's also kind of the reason
00:08:01 why Devil May Cry is great.
00:08:02 It's because it's just like fucking stupid,
00:08:04 but like in a cool way.
00:08:05 You know, I wanted to clarify.
00:08:07 I just didn't have time to say everything I wanted to.
00:08:09 Like, I wanted to say how much I love the ending
00:08:11 of Devil May Cry 3.
00:08:13 Like, it is so good.
00:08:14 And I absolutely love it.
00:08:16 And like, the intro, like, I don't feel as much
00:08:18 of an attachment to.
00:08:19 So I feel like if things skewed a little more negative
00:08:21 than I wanted to in the video anyway
00:08:23 about like the whole series.
00:08:24 But I mean, yeah.
00:08:26 Just just to be clear, just to clarify
00:08:28 before I like jump down and throw it.
00:08:29 I've only watched the first 15 minutes of the video
00:08:31 because then I had to come up here.
00:08:33 It does get more positive.
00:08:34 And I don't even care that you think it's that
00:08:37 that like you don't understand it because I'm not
00:08:39 going to sit here and say I understand everything either.
00:08:41 I just thought it was hilarious that like
00:08:43 you're the three hour Kingdom Hearts lecture man is like
00:08:46 the story confuses me.
00:08:48 I just thought that was like saying that I because
00:08:50 I did a three hour lecture on Kingdom Hearts
00:08:52 or whatever that I that I can't be critical
00:08:55 or have any concerns about any story
00:08:58 that's overly complex.
00:08:59 I'm the first one to admit Kingdom Hearts is overly
00:09:02 complicated and doesn't need to be this way.
00:09:04 It's just that it hooked me early.
00:09:06 So I just got dragged along for the whole ride.
00:09:08 But I see your point.
00:09:09 I certainly see the.
00:09:10 I will say and I agree that I think the Devil May Cry one
00:09:13 is still, I mean, I've said it before.
00:09:15 It's still my favorite.
00:09:16 I think it's so good.
00:09:17 I love it so much.
00:09:18 Great.
00:09:19 And I actually mentioned this in the I Am Games video
00:09:22 I did with DG when we were talking about our favorite
00:09:24 games is that because that one's by Hideki Kamiya,
00:09:27 it has a tone that's different from the rest.
00:09:29 And I kind of miss that.
00:09:30 For sure.
00:09:31 It's a little bit more grounded, but just like,
00:09:33 I don't know, just the subduedness of it is kind of cool.
00:09:36 But at the same time, like it soon as like crazy over the top
00:09:39 insanity is also cool in its own way.
00:09:41 I mean, yeah, they're two different flavors.
00:09:43 And I definitely feel like there could absolutely be a divide
00:09:46 about like, depending on what kind of person you are,
00:09:48 like I always like the gaming Brit.
00:09:49 He, he's a guy in my eye.
00:09:51 It seems like like the Itsuno Devil May Cry games,
00:09:53 like that's, he's the guy for those for sure.
00:09:56 Whereas I feel like I'm more of a DMC one kind of guy,
00:09:59 but, but I want to learn about this world
00:10:02 because I do not understand it.
00:10:04 Now, I mean, that's what I talk about in the video.
00:10:05 So people can go listen to that for more.
00:10:07 But by the way, you were saying about James Rolfe.
00:10:09 I was just curious about his Power Rangers video.
00:10:12 Has Linkara filed litigation?
00:10:15 Yes, because he's coaching on his turf.
00:10:18 And is he shutting down this operation?
00:10:20 Because as far as I know, Linkara is the only man on the world
00:10:23 who's talked about Power Rangers in any capacity.
00:10:26 You shouldn't actually be telling all of it.
00:10:28 You could tell you all about the, about recording
00:10:30 and the production.
00:10:31 Mr. Green.
00:10:32 Yeah, yeah.
00:10:33 It was a pretty, pretty, pretty intense on set, you know,
00:10:37 having to just stand around and do nothing
00:10:39 because we got all the Asian actors already from five years ago
00:10:42 to do all the action scenes.
00:10:43 Right.
00:10:44 You know, I had to like put the helmet on sometimes
00:10:46 and stand there and shake my head a little bit
00:10:48 to make it look like I was talking in the dubbed dialogue,
00:10:50 whatever it was.
00:10:51 Ah, yes, classic.
00:10:52 It was great.
00:10:53 10 out of 10 experience would do again.
00:10:55 You know, this might be an embarrassing truth.
00:10:59 This might be like a thing like,
00:11:00 uh-oh, why did you say that?
00:11:02 But I have actually watched all of those
00:11:05 Linkara reviews of Power Rangers.
00:11:07 Uh-oh.
00:11:08 You watched a YouTube video
00:11:10 that might not be considered quality.
00:11:12 Guys, time to call out the firing squad.
00:11:15 They're going to fucking tell the me that I like bad things
00:11:18 and then they're going to think I'm stupid.
00:11:20 All right, tickle them to death, please.
00:11:22 No.
00:11:23 That's gay.
00:11:24 Get out of there.
00:11:25 Are they good though?
00:11:26 Are they enjoyable?
00:11:27 Uh, I mean, I've marathoned a lot of
00:11:29 that guy with the glasses stuff just because
00:11:32 and I used to like nostalgia critic.
00:11:34 I guess I used to like Linkara as well.
00:11:36 They were just sort of like, ah, yeah, I guess.
00:11:39 I mean, you know.
00:11:40 The comic stuff was like,
00:11:42 I don't care about comics and the way he does them
00:11:44 is always terrible,
00:11:45 but like a video review of something
00:11:48 is inherently a little more interesting
00:11:50 because I'm looking at the thing
00:11:52 and it's like moving around.
00:11:54 That's certainly true.
00:11:55 Certainly true.
00:11:56 When you're a kid and all you want to do is feed,
00:11:59 then watching nostalgia critic
00:12:01 isn't at all a strange thing to do.
00:12:03 I used to watch it all the time.
00:12:06 I don't even know whether I was that young.
00:12:08 It was like five years ago or something.
00:12:11 Whatever.
00:12:12 Munchy, can you run that by me again?
00:12:14 What do we need to do?
00:12:15 Oh, just when you need it.
00:12:17 Feed.
00:12:18 Okay, okay.
00:12:19 All right.
00:12:20 You just need to feed.
00:12:21 You need to consume.
00:12:22 Oh, all right.
00:12:23 This is a new concept to me,
00:12:24 so it's blowing my mind.
00:12:25 Well, yeah, I know you're post content and post food.
00:12:28 I actually, you know, looking back on it,
00:12:30 my internet search history
00:12:32 and my internet history in general,
00:12:34 like I was not a YouTube kind of guy
00:12:37 who was like watching nostalgia critic
00:12:39 and like I totally missed fucking
00:12:42 the angry video game nerd completely
00:12:44 and I'm still looking to go back to that.
00:12:46 That shit was like old hat
00:12:47 by the time I even like was aware.
00:12:49 I mean, like I had probably heard of it before.
00:12:52 How is that possible?
00:12:54 Because I was watching AVG.
00:12:55 Well, I mean, I don't know.
00:12:57 But it's due to Ben that I got into it
00:12:59 when Ben turned me on to like the pony stuff.
00:13:01 That's when I really dived into it.
00:13:03 Whoa, holy shit.
00:13:04 Yeah.
00:13:05 Like when did, um,
00:13:07 angry video game nerd probably started first, right?
00:13:10 Before the nostalgia critic.
00:13:11 Yeah.
00:13:12 He started before YouTube was a thing.
00:13:14 He used to make home videos of that for his friends.
00:13:16 Sure.
00:13:17 But I'm sure no one was watching it at that point.
00:13:19 Well, yeah.
00:13:20 No, you couldn't.
00:13:21 Yeah.
00:13:22 I think it was like pretty soon after YouTube got started.
00:13:24 So it had been like around 2006
00:13:26 because it was originally the angry Nintendo nerd
00:13:28 and then you'd be branded for copyright.
00:13:30 Well, like I watched,
00:13:31 so I was in college until like 2010 or something.
00:13:35 And I was watching YouTube around them,
00:13:37 but I definitely was not watching, uh,
00:13:39 uh, yeah, it wasn't,
00:13:41 it wasn't until like pony stuff.
00:13:43 Weirdly.
00:13:44 I mean, I had in college, in college,
00:13:46 me and my friends,
00:13:47 okay, this, this,
00:13:48 we did delete this,
00:13:49 but we made a video game review,
00:13:52 um, in like a group,
00:13:54 attempt to be relatively comedic.
00:13:56 Whoa.
00:13:57 It was, uh, we made one on,
00:13:59 it was, it was, I believe it was Ratchet and Clank,
00:14:02 uh, like it was the first one of the new PS3 games.
00:14:05 I forget which one it is.
00:14:07 But it was one that everybody loves.
00:14:08 Tools of destruction.
00:14:09 Oh, that's not a good one.
00:14:11 No, it wasn't Tools of Destruction.
00:14:12 I'll destroy that game.
00:14:13 Wait, was it not?
00:14:14 You know what?
00:14:15 I'll, I'll, I'll Google it while I look this up.
00:14:16 That game, that game was a miserable experience.
00:14:17 I played that in 2015.
00:14:19 I, I, I can't believe,
00:14:20 I can't believe Nate showed up hippo
00:14:22 before hippo was even born.
00:14:24 I know.
00:14:25 I, I, which one was it?
00:14:26 Was it, I guess it was,
00:14:28 no, it was a cracking time.
00:14:29 I'm like 99% sure it was a cracking time,
00:14:31 which I think,
00:14:32 Cracking my ass.
00:14:33 The crack, cracking time wasn't too bad.
00:14:35 The point is though that, uh, like,
00:14:38 so obviously I was aware.
00:14:40 The idea was to release this on YouTube.
00:14:42 Uh, so clearly I knew about YouTube stuff.
00:14:45 But all the production fees and just the publishing,
00:14:47 you know, just,
00:14:48 Oh my God.
00:14:49 I wish that still existed,
00:14:50 but like we finished this product.
00:14:52 Okay.
00:14:53 And then we looked it over.
00:14:54 I think I edited it.
00:14:55 We filmed it on like my old parents' camera or something.
00:14:57 Uh, and then we all sat around like in a dark room
00:15:00 with like the glowing neon light illuminating us.
00:15:03 We all stood and watched this like 15 minute
00:15:05 ratchet and client game review.
00:15:07 We all, it finished.
00:15:08 We looked at each other and we said,
00:15:09 We have to destroy this.
00:15:11 It has to be removed from existence.
00:15:13 And that's exactly what I did.
00:15:15 Were there dude,
00:15:16 what the freak moment?
00:15:17 Basically.
00:15:18 I can only imagine.
00:15:19 That would be, that would be such a cursed,
00:15:20 that would be such a cursed artifact
00:15:21 if it still existed.
00:15:22 That would be so.
00:15:23 It doesn't though.
00:15:24 I'm pretty sure we completely explained it.
00:15:26 It would be so incredible to post now.
00:15:28 I wish I hadn't.
00:15:29 I wish I had kept it.
00:15:30 Oh my God.
00:15:31 It was so fucked up.
00:15:32 Dude, what if it's on the camera?
00:15:33 What if, what if the raw footage exists?
00:15:35 You know,
00:15:36 You're gonna react that down.
00:15:37 You're gonna react that down.
00:15:38 Gonna get the VHS out of the archives.
00:15:40 The RCA.
00:15:41 Whatever it's called.
00:15:42 The little tapes.
00:15:43 I mean, I'd have to like call my parents.
00:15:44 Okay.
00:15:45 Tell you what.
00:15:46 I will, I will do a cursory investigation
00:15:48 to see if I could possibly unearth this thing.
00:15:50 But, uh, but we'll see.
00:15:52 We'll see.
00:15:53 There's nothing more intense
00:15:54 than a cursory investigation by Nate.
00:15:56 Yeah.
00:15:57 Honestly though,
00:15:58 I don't want to get people's hopes up
00:15:59 because like 99.9.
00:16:00 Like even that feels like,
00:16:01 but there's like a 0.1% chance.
00:16:03 Like it's not, it's basically zero.
00:16:05 It's pretty much just zero.
00:16:06 Yeah.
00:16:07 Yeah.
00:16:08 It would be a miracle.
00:16:09 I remember deleting it.
00:16:10 Barring an act of God.
00:16:11 Yeah, we'll see.
00:16:12 And I mean,
00:16:13 although God is real,
00:16:14 so hopefully that this is real.
00:16:15 No, I just,
00:16:16 I just tweeted before we started
00:16:17 that I'm an atheist
00:16:18 that God isn't real.
00:16:19 What?
00:16:20 Dude, dude.
00:16:21 I actually,
00:16:22 It's true.
00:16:23 Represent.
00:16:24 Tom, proud of you.
00:16:25 I'm proud of someone's out there
00:16:26 willing to say it.
00:16:27 Someone has the courage.
00:16:28 I mean, to be fair,
00:16:29 I was making a Dark Souls 3 joke,
00:16:30 but it stands for God.
00:16:31 Guys, hot, hot take on God,
00:16:32 hot take on God,
00:16:33 fake.
00:16:34 Hot, not real.
00:16:35 I think he's just
00:16:36 a little bit fake.
00:16:37 Hey, speaking of me
00:16:38 making videos though,
00:16:39 I'm currently doing that.
00:16:40 Uh, and other things,
00:16:41 me and Mafia 2 is on,
00:16:43 ladies and gentlemen,
00:16:44 and you're probably watching it,
00:16:46 hopefully.
00:16:47 Uh, so that's cool.
00:16:48 But really,
00:16:49 me and Mafia 2 is,
00:16:50 is simply kind of just a hype engine
00:16:53 in order to propel
00:16:55 the excitement for my channel
00:16:56 that is going full time.
00:16:58 I have tendered my resignation
00:16:59 at my job.
00:17:00 I kept it a secret
00:17:01 until I announced me a Mafia.
00:17:03 And, uh, yeah, I quit.
00:17:05 I, I, I knew about it.
00:17:07 I knew about it.
00:17:08 Oh, did I tell you ahead of time?
00:17:09 I couldn't remember who I told.
00:17:10 Uh, you, you did not tell me.
00:17:11 There have been murmurings in chat.
00:17:13 Oh, did the parents spill the beans?
00:17:15 My dad, you're dead.
00:17:16 Your own dad.
00:17:17 Your own dad.
00:17:18 Spill the beans.
00:17:19 Spill the beans.
00:17:20 Be solo in pregnancy with dad.
00:17:22 Wait, hold on.
00:17:23 Why did your dad know
00:17:24 that you were making me a Mafia?
00:17:26 Why did you tell your father?
00:17:27 Because he has to tell him everything.
00:17:28 He has him under his iron foot.
00:17:29 No, you fucking nerd.
00:17:30 He knew, he knew that he was
00:17:31 tendering his, he knew that he was,
00:17:32 he knew that he was
00:17:33 tendering his resignation.
00:17:34 Yeah.
00:17:35 In fact, my dad didn't spill.
00:17:36 He, my dad didn't call me up
00:17:38 and say, dude, Ben,
00:17:39 do you hear about this new me a Mafia
00:17:40 that's about to happen?
00:17:41 Yeah.
00:17:42 That's where I was gonna add to it.
00:17:43 You know, okay.
00:17:44 As, as a matter of fact,
00:17:45 I, uh, did not tell my dad,
00:17:46 like about me a Mafia, frankly,
00:17:48 cause I, you know, like he's not
00:17:49 really up with the lore.
00:17:50 Yeah, I wouldn't imagine that you would.
00:17:52 But, but what I did do was
00:17:53 I called him,
00:17:54 when I was thinking about
00:17:55 leaving my job,
00:17:56 I called my dad and my parents
00:17:57 and wanted their sage advice,
00:17:59 which is exactly what I got.
00:18:00 And, uh, so, you know,
00:18:02 it was all part of my,
00:18:03 my process of moving my way out.
00:18:05 I had to talk to my parents
00:18:06 so I wouldn't be scared and alone.
00:18:07 Um, but yeah.
00:18:08 Yeah.
00:18:09 So, so I guess the good news is
00:18:10 they seem pretty positive
00:18:11 about how things are going,
00:18:12 so that's nice.
00:18:13 So to be clear, this isn't
00:18:14 me a Mafia's building up
00:18:15 and then like you're going to
00:18:16 quit on me a Mafia.
00:18:17 Like the wheels are in motion.
00:18:19 This shit is happening.
00:18:20 I had, I had titted my resignation
00:18:21 over a month ago at my job.
00:18:23 It's just, it's like,
00:18:24 because of my job,
00:18:25 it's like a team I'm a member of
00:18:26 and we got a lot of stuff
00:18:27 on the wheels.
00:18:28 Uh, they, they asked me to stay on.
00:18:29 In fact, I was hoping to be gone
00:18:31 by the beginning of May,
00:18:32 a little bit unhappy
00:18:33 that that's not the case.
00:18:34 But I mean, hey,
00:18:35 they asked me to stay.
00:18:36 I agreed.
00:18:37 And frankly,
00:18:38 this is laying the foundation
00:18:39 as people take, take my advice.
00:18:41 I think this is wise.
00:18:42 Don't burn bridges.
00:18:43 Like I'm going out of my way
00:18:44 to do extra work for these guys
00:18:46 so that I have a safety net.
00:18:48 So they already say like,
00:18:49 hey, Nate, if things don't work
00:18:50 out, give us a call.
00:18:51 Yeah, we could probably fit you
00:18:52 back in here.
00:18:53 Um, like if things don't work
00:18:54 out, I will be fine.
00:18:56 Cause frankly, my job is great.
00:18:57 Uh, it's just that you,
00:18:58 does that, does that mean
00:18:59 you're staying,
00:19:00 you're staying in the area
00:19:01 or not moving anywhere.
00:19:02 You're not,
00:19:03 you're not PCPH queuing it up.
00:19:04 Well, okay.
00:19:05 See that that's the,
00:19:06 so plans have not yet been made
00:19:08 as to exactly where to move,
00:19:10 but I still think that
00:19:11 to exactly where to move,
00:19:13 but I certainly plan to move
00:19:14 somewhere because there's
00:19:15 nothing tying me here anymore.
00:19:16 And frankly,
00:19:17 me and Michelle are both
00:19:18 looking forward to,
00:19:19 uh, I mean,
00:19:20 among other things,
00:19:21 seeing the ocean on a regular
00:19:22 basis.
00:19:23 I just,
00:19:24 I just crave that ocean for you
00:19:25 over here.
00:19:26 That's true.
00:19:27 That's true.
00:19:28 And I mean,
00:19:29 okay, now to get a little bit
00:19:30 dark with it,
00:19:31 I wonder if me,
00:19:32 my,
00:19:33 my, my nature to keep things
00:19:34 secret,
00:19:35 uh, is so strong,
00:19:36 my comp,
00:19:37 my compulsion to not spill the
00:19:38 beans and to surprise everyone
00:19:40 in a favorable way was so strong
00:19:42 that I couldn't bring myself to like
00:19:44 discuss any future possible plans
00:19:46 with like any of you guys
00:19:47 or Digi or anything,
00:19:49 even though that probably would
00:19:50 have been a wise idea,
00:19:51 uh,
00:19:52 to see what happens.
00:19:53 But,
00:19:54 uh, I mean,
00:19:55 so we all know Digi's
00:19:56 in Virginia Beach now.
00:19:57 Right.
00:19:58 So, uh,
00:19:59 he seems pretty dead set there.
00:20:00 I mean,
00:20:01 that's the negative side
00:20:02 of your natural showmanship.
00:20:03 Everything has to be,
00:20:04 has to have the,
00:20:05 the wow factor.
00:20:06 So we can't ever know,
00:20:07 but I,
00:20:08 but I was,
00:20:09 I was,
00:20:10 I was privy for at least like a month.
00:20:12 Oh, of course.
00:20:13 Because Munchy had to do
00:20:14 the fucking logo, of course.
00:20:15 Uh, as,
00:20:16 as I,
00:20:17 I'm the logo Smith
00:20:18 for your entire channel.
00:20:19 Have you,
00:20:20 have you seen,
00:20:21 there's a lot of positive feedback
00:20:22 about the logo.
00:20:23 Is there,
00:20:24 is there,
00:20:25 absolutely,
00:20:26 people are way into it.
00:20:27 They fucking better be.
00:20:28 And,
00:20:29 and the fucking,
00:20:30 yeah,
00:20:31 we were,
00:20:32 we slaved on this logo.
00:20:33 Uh,
00:20:34 I forced you to be my slave.
00:20:35 We,
00:20:36 we slaved,
00:20:37 we slaved smash cut to you
00:20:38 You know,
00:20:39 it really hurts cracking
00:20:40 that whip after so long.
00:20:41 Oh,
00:20:42 it's not,
00:20:43 it's more than zero effort
00:20:44 to work with Munchy on it.
00:20:45 That's true.
00:20:46 That's true.
00:20:47 You were very involved with
00:20:48 I got,
00:20:49 I got fallen arches
00:20:50 from crushing Munchy
00:20:51 under my boot heel.
00:20:52 Indeed.
00:20:53 It turned out great though.
00:20:54 It turned out great.
00:20:55 As always,
00:20:56 as always,
00:20:57 oh,
00:20:58 it did.
00:20:59 And as always,
00:21:00 I stand up for employers
00:21:01 who are the real heroes.
00:21:02 You know,
00:21:03 they're,
00:21:04 you should,
00:21:05 you should fucking,
00:21:06 you should move to London
00:21:07 take the dogs to the park
00:21:08 and they can play
00:21:09 in the park.
00:21:10 Oh,
00:21:11 Sonny and Sessho
00:21:12 hanging out.
00:21:13 That would be great.
00:21:14 I'd love to do that.
00:21:15 Maybe I'll fucking walk
00:21:16 the dog daily.
00:21:17 Maybe,
00:21:18 probably not though.
00:21:19 Yeah.
00:21:20 You should,
00:21:21 you should,
00:21:22 you could unironically
00:21:23 make a vlog of you
00:21:24 with your phone out
00:21:25 like walking the dog every day
00:21:26 on a show.
00:21:27 Oh dude,
00:21:28 straight up.
00:21:29 Okay.
00:21:30 All right.
00:21:31 Here's a video idea for you.
00:21:32 You get your GoPro
00:21:33 and put it on your dog's ass.
00:21:34 Record a vlog
00:21:35 from the dog's ass
00:21:36 Oh my God.
00:21:37 So you're walking down the street
00:21:38 and you're just like,
00:21:39 like the,
00:21:40 like the leash is going down
00:21:41 to the video,
00:21:42 like,
00:21:43 like from the angle
00:21:44 which the dog's ass is at
00:21:45 and you talk down to it.
00:21:46 That's the,
00:21:47 that's the vlog.
00:21:48 You strap an iPad
00:21:49 to the back of the dog's
00:21:50 you can see.
00:21:51 Yeah.
00:21:52 Oh dude,
00:21:53 that's next level boomer shit.
00:21:55 Like you put farms
00:21:56 on your iPad
00:21:57 and put it on your dog's
00:21:58 ass while you're walking
00:21:59 your dog.
00:22:00 I have several
00:22:01 good ideas for videos
00:22:03 that I've been cooking up
00:22:04 for a long time.
00:22:05 And that's
00:22:06 doing things with the GoPro.
00:22:07 Doing things with the GoPro.
00:22:08 I have not really thought about it.
00:22:09 We all have.
00:22:10 I mean,
00:22:11 the great thing about it
00:22:12 is the list is totally changing
00:22:13 every single day.
00:22:14 I start basically at zero
00:22:16 and just have to come up
00:22:17 with something.
00:22:18 So,
00:22:19 I've got a few questions.
00:22:20 So I'm going to ask these
00:22:21 and then if they're two,
00:22:22 if they're two,
00:22:23 you know,
00:22:24 next level
00:22:25 then feel free to deny answer.
00:22:26 How much of this?
00:22:27 Okay.
00:22:28 Cause this was the same thing
00:22:29 for the last minute and a half.
00:22:30 So obviously you had time
00:22:32 to prepare
00:22:33 and you had thought about this
00:22:34 because you know,
00:22:35 you quit your job
00:22:36 and I'm sure for many a few months
00:22:37 beforehand,
00:22:38 how many of these videos
00:22:39 were pre-made?
00:22:41 Zero.
00:22:42 Zero videos
00:22:43 have been pre-made.
00:22:44 Really?
00:22:45 That's correct.
00:22:46 Every single one
00:22:47 was made on that day.
00:22:48 That wasn't even
00:22:49 the case for the first one,
00:22:50 was it?
00:22:51 Yeah.
00:22:52 Actually,
00:22:53 okay.
00:22:54 Frankly,
00:22:55 I was just kind of
00:22:56 fucking around
00:22:57 and not getting my,
00:22:58 my,
00:22:59 my,
00:23:00 my,
00:23:01 my,
00:23:02 my,
00:23:03 the end of April
00:23:04 when I was announcing it
00:23:05 and I was like, well,
00:23:06 I guess this is how much time I have.
00:23:07 I'm kind of hoping to
00:23:08 currently
00:23:09 make,
00:23:10 like manage to make two in a day
00:23:11 so I can get a little bit
00:23:12 of a buffer back
00:23:13 so that I have a little more
00:23:14 time to relax.
00:23:15 Cause this is a,
00:23:16 that's crazy.
00:23:17 I'm getting very little sleep.
00:23:18 That is insane.
00:23:19 Very, very little sleep.
00:23:20 I mean,
00:23:21 I can imagine you're still going
00:23:22 into your job.
00:23:23 So all of these are just coming in.
00:23:24 Okay.
00:23:25 So you got your,
00:23:26 you got your working hours,
00:23:27 of course.
00:23:28 What are your working hours?
00:23:29 You know,
00:23:30 capital W,
00:23:31 like real work,
00:23:32 okay.
00:23:33 You know what?
00:23:34 So,
00:23:35 so,
00:23:36 I don't want to give anybody too
00:23:37 much of a false impression.
00:23:38 The thing is we worked
00:23:39 out a deal.
00:23:40 I'm working a few hours
00:23:41 less than full time now
00:23:42 for the remainder
00:23:43 until I'm out at work.
00:23:44 So that gives me about
00:23:45 like two extra hours
00:23:46 in a day to work on stuff,
00:23:47 which is not a ton,
00:23:48 but it is something.
00:23:49 So things are a little bit
00:23:50 easier than they were
00:23:51 for,
00:23:52 for me a math of a one.
00:23:53 Thank God.
00:23:54 But basically I,
00:23:55 I've committed about
00:23:56 six hours every
00:23:57 work day
00:23:58 to my
00:23:59 job,
00:24:00 job.
00:24:01 And I got to,
00:24:02 you know,
00:24:03 do me a math of a stuff
00:24:04 and do everything
00:24:05 else I got to do in the day.
00:24:06 So,
00:24:07 frankly,
00:24:08 it's been,
00:24:09 I've just,
00:24:10 just like,
00:24:11 I'm just in my office,
00:24:12 like all day.
00:24:13 Can't,
00:24:14 I want to watch the new
00:24:15 Game of Thrones,
00:24:16 but I don't have time.
00:24:17 God damn it.
00:24:18 You're missing nothing.
00:24:19 It's fucking shit.
00:24:20 But that,
00:24:21 well,
00:24:22 the last episode
00:24:23 sounded like it was a big,
00:24:24 a big deal,
00:24:25 but I haven't seen it.
00:24:26 So I wouldn't know.
00:24:27 It was a spoil.
00:24:28 Don't spoil me Tom.
00:24:29 Don't you do it.
00:24:30 You're in for a surprise.
00:24:31 You're in for a surprise.
00:24:32 I'm going to say the Game of Thrones
00:24:33 word.
00:24:34 I'm going to say it.
00:24:35 Well,
00:24:36 you see,
00:24:37 in Game of Thrones,
00:24:38 Game of Thrones,
00:24:39 James,
00:24:40 James Game,
00:24:41 the main character,
00:24:42 found that there were six rocks
00:24:44 across the
00:24:45 world of
00:24:46 Thronia,
00:24:47 and that he had
00:24:48 to drag them down
00:24:49 in order to,
00:24:50 you know,
00:24:51 become more powerful.
00:24:52 Sorry,
00:24:53 well,
00:24:54 that's pretty sick.
00:24:55 I was enrolled.
00:24:56 Yes.
00:24:57 The last words,
00:24:58 the final,
00:24:59 the ending,
00:25:00 you know,
00:25:01 shambles his broke ass in
00:25:02 and he sees John Snow
00:25:03 sitting on the throne
00:25:04 and John Snow
00:25:05 suddenly looks down
00:25:06 and says,
00:25:07 huh,
00:25:08 chaos control.
00:25:09 Cut to credits.
00:25:10 That's the end.
00:25:11 We don't even see that.
00:25:12 We don't even see that.
00:25:13 We don't see what happens,
00:25:14 but we know,
00:25:15 we know what happens.
00:25:16 Chaos has been controlled.
00:25:17 Nate.
00:25:18 He goes,
00:25:19 he goes super,
00:25:20 John.
00:25:21 Are you in
00:25:22 the work doghouse
00:25:23 right now
00:25:24 and just fully devoting
00:25:25 your time
00:25:26 to making things?
00:25:27 Do you have any time
00:25:28 or anything else?
00:25:29 Um,
00:25:30 well,
00:25:31 I'm trying to kind of
00:25:32 carve out time
00:25:33 to do other things,
00:25:34 not really,
00:25:35 although even,
00:25:36 even in the depths of
00:25:37 uh,
00:25:38 uh,
00:25:39 Miamavva,
00:25:40 I still find myself
00:25:41 like wasting time
00:25:42 when I need to get to
00:25:43 the video
00:25:44 and still,
00:25:45 you know,
00:25:46 in what way,
00:25:47 in what way?
00:25:48 Well,
00:25:49 I mean,
00:25:50 just for example,
00:25:51 the,
00:25:52 the one I did on Sekiro,
00:25:53 the Sekiro video,
00:25:54 like I had everything
00:25:55 I needed to get started
00:25:56 on that video,
00:25:57 I can't remember exactly
00:25:58 what I was doing that day.
00:25:59 It's all kind of blurring together,
00:26:00 but like,
00:26:01 I know that I only started
00:26:02 recording that
00:26:03 at like 10,
00:26:04 no,
00:26:05 okay,
00:26:06 I recorded like the intro stuff,
00:26:07 which was way too much,
00:26:08 probably,
00:26:09 and I shouldn't have done it.
00:26:10 Uh,
00:26:11 but then I only started like
00:26:12 the main video
00:26:13 recording the actual
00:26:14 like discussion of the game
00:26:15 at like 10 p.m.
00:26:16 And
00:26:17 like that was like,
00:26:18 that was like three hours later
00:26:19 than I could have been
00:26:20 if I'd just been peak
00:26:21 efficiency.
00:26:22 So I don't know why
00:26:23 that happened,
00:26:24 but I ended up releasing
00:26:25 that video, you know,
00:26:26 because I just took that long
00:26:27 to get it done.
00:26:28 And, you know,
00:26:29 that's just,
00:26:30 that's just what I have to do.
00:26:31 I,
00:26:32 now I have,
00:26:33 to my credit,
00:26:34 I have founded myself
00:26:35 the absolute iron will.
00:26:36 I will not stop
00:26:37 until the video is done that day.
00:26:39 And it's nice to feel that again.
00:26:41 It feels good.
00:26:42 It feels good.
00:26:43 So that's cool.
00:26:44 I like that Sekiro video.
00:26:45 It's very,
00:26:46 very informative and fun
00:26:47 and epic with the sword.
00:26:49 Yeah.
00:26:50 I like it too.
00:26:51 It's good.
00:26:52 It's good.
00:26:53 So you've been doing these
00:26:54 for how many days?
00:26:55 Five,
00:26:56 five days.
00:26:57 We're on day six today?
00:26:58 No,
00:26:59 day five today.
00:27:00 Although there was also day zero,
00:27:01 so.
00:27:02 Have there been any,
00:27:03 like,
00:27:04 you just thought that you couldn't
00:27:06 get the video out?
00:27:07 Or is that iron will
00:27:08 just so prevalent
00:27:09 that you just
00:27:10 could not even imagine it?
00:27:11 There have been issues.
00:27:12 Okay.
00:27:13 So one of the things that
00:27:14 happened with,
00:27:15 I believe it was the
00:27:16 Sekiro video.
00:27:17 Oh, no.
00:27:18 Okay.
00:27:19 I was going to say,
00:27:20 there was another technique
00:27:21 club.
00:27:22 Oh, there was another thing
00:27:23 with the stream.
00:27:24 There was so much stress.
00:27:25 Like I,
00:27:26 because the aforementioned iron
00:27:28 will,
00:27:29 a video must come out that day
00:27:30 when it seems like things are
00:27:32 going horribly awry
00:27:33 and the video may not come out.
00:27:35 Like it can't not come out.
00:27:37 It has to come out.
00:27:39 What,
00:27:40 if I need to scrap what I've
00:27:41 done and re-record just a new
00:27:42 video,
00:27:43 that's what will be done.
00:27:45 But like,
00:27:46 okay,
00:27:47 so I discovered a wonderful
00:27:49 feature of Sony Vegas,
00:27:51 ladies and gentlemen.
00:27:52 And so my camera happens to
00:27:53 record MOV files.
00:27:55 And in the past,
00:27:56 I've noticed sometimes,
00:27:57 just when I put too many videos,
00:27:59 just the whole project breaks.
00:28:01 And this actually happened with
00:28:02 the Kingdom Hearts video.
00:28:03 The way that I finished my
00:28:04 Kingdom Hearts,
00:28:05 we Agua,
00:28:06 was I actually broke that file
00:28:08 into several different
00:28:10 Vegas files and then rendered
00:28:12 the pieces together once they were
00:28:14 all rendered individually.
00:28:16 So that shouldn't be
00:28:17 necessary.
00:28:18 Why did that have to happen, Nate?
00:28:19 Well, I found the answer while
00:28:21 working on the Sekiro video.
00:28:22 At least I believe it was that one.
00:28:24 And it was that,
00:28:25 did you know that Sony Vegas,
00:28:27 which uses QuickTime to support
00:28:29 MOV files,
00:28:30 can only handle
00:28:32 up to a certain amount of
00:28:34 MOV files.
00:28:35 And when you go over that
00:28:37 number,
00:28:38 it doesn't give you an error.
00:28:39 The files simply stop
00:28:41 working in Sony Vegas.
00:28:43 So picture me,
00:28:44 it's already like 1 a.m.
00:28:46 I've been struggling for two
00:28:48 hours to figure out
00:28:49 why the fuck these perfectly
00:28:51 good video files will just
00:28:53 not be visible in the
00:28:55 Sony Vegas.
00:28:56 And then I,
00:28:57 you know, I'm spending hours
00:28:58 searching to try to find the
00:28:59 answer.
00:29:00 And then someone in a random
00:29:01 YouTube tutorial says,
00:29:02 oh, by the way,
00:29:03 just so you know,
00:29:04 Sony Vegas breaks if you have
00:29:05 too many fucking MOV files,
00:29:06 so make sure you don't have
00:29:07 too many.
00:29:08 And I'm like,
00:29:09 well, why the fuck didn't you
00:29:10 say so?
00:29:11 And so that's,
00:29:13 now I know.
00:29:14 Like, now that I knew that,
00:29:15 I could-
00:29:16 That should have just been one
00:29:17 year,
00:29:18 you're a mere math of a video.
00:29:19 It's just public service
00:29:20 video.
00:29:21 That's like the story of making
00:29:23 a mere math of a-
00:29:24 The way-
00:29:25 Detail like all the issues I
00:29:26 had so far.
00:29:27 Oh, you could set like a
00:29:28 making of video,
00:29:29 like a making of episode.
00:29:30 Yeah, yeah.
00:29:31 Something like that.
00:29:32 You go to a mere math of a
00:29:33 factor and just start cranking
00:29:34 out the same shit over and
00:29:35 over and just like,
00:29:36 like just teams and teams.
00:29:37 Yeah, you do a making of the
00:29:39 video and then the next day
00:29:40 you do a making of the
00:29:41 making of.
00:29:42 Yeah, yeah.
00:29:43 Forever.
00:29:44 And that's the rest of the
00:29:45 month for you right there.
00:29:46 That's the rest of the month.
00:29:47 Yeah.
00:29:48 We've got the formula down.
00:29:49 The way it usually goes is
00:29:51 that when you learn a
00:29:53 program to, you know,
00:29:55 use it for whatever creative
00:29:57 job, you know, you learn
00:29:58 Photoshop or you learn,
00:29:59 you know, I don't know,
00:30:00 Dasty or something, you know,
00:30:01 FL Studio or something.
00:30:02 Then you, there's a hump
00:30:04 where you're getting a lot of
00:30:05 errors because you don't know
00:30:06 how to use the program.
00:30:07 Right.
00:30:08 And you're using it in ways
00:30:09 that it doesn't intend.
00:30:10 It seems that Vegas,
00:30:11 that initial hump is forever.
00:30:14 Like you never get out of
00:30:16 getting errors in Vegas.
00:30:17 It seems like no matter what,
00:30:18 even people who have been
00:30:19 aiming for years seem to always
00:30:21 just have problems in that
00:30:22 program.
00:30:23 So I decided to learn it
00:30:24 myself.
00:30:25 I would bet that there are
00:30:26 peculiarities of most types of,
00:30:28 of any kind of software.
00:30:29 You know, as a software
00:30:30 developer myself,
00:30:32 formally full-time, now
00:30:34 part-ish time and soon to be
00:30:35 not at all.
00:30:37 There's always stuff that you
00:30:39 discover as you're like doing
00:30:40 more robust testing.
00:30:41 If you're doing the same,
00:30:42 like we, at my job, we have a,
00:30:44 we have a software that we give
00:30:45 to customers and like things
00:30:47 can absolutely break.
00:30:48 If you just do things in like,
00:30:50 on the edge cases of like what
00:30:51 you're currently working on
00:30:52 or whatever.
00:30:53 But the thing is our customers,
00:30:55 they do the same thing over
00:30:56 and over and over again with
00:30:57 the software.
00:30:58 So like really for them,
00:31:00 they don't need to worry about
00:31:01 like these, these edge case
00:31:02 issues.
00:31:03 But we do.
00:31:04 Like when customers are,
00:31:05 you know, they're going to want
00:31:06 to use it for something
00:31:07 slightly different than,
00:31:08 you know, what we've prepared
00:31:09 for.
00:31:10 So, you know,
00:31:11 always happens.
00:31:12 I feel like this will not be
00:31:13 answered.
00:31:14 I'm not going to ask for
00:31:15 specifics.
00:31:16 Like, you know, names,
00:31:17 but can you tell us what your
00:31:19 software is?
00:31:20 So I think I'll just forever
00:31:22 not say.
00:31:23 Nuclear launch codes.
00:31:26 Because of the possibility
00:31:27 that I will one day go back.
00:31:28 I don't want anyone to know
00:31:29 where I actually work.
00:31:31 So, so, but I'll tell you,
00:31:33 the software basically what it
00:31:34 does is it's,
00:31:36 it's a file transfer protocol
00:31:38 specifically for CAD 3D model
00:31:40 files that people use for
00:31:42 engineering.
00:31:43 3D printing nuclear bonds.
00:31:45 Indeed.
00:31:46 Well, like that pizza, you know,
00:31:48 there's some kids down there,
00:31:49 and they need to be
00:31:50 taught some lessons
00:31:51 from your home channel.
00:31:52 Fucking.
00:31:53 That's fair.
00:31:54 Fair.
00:31:55 But one of the things that
00:31:56 our software can do is like,
00:31:57 it can change the file type
00:31:59 as it, as it is being sent
00:32:01 through the pipeline.
00:32:02 As it's thrown midair to
00:32:03 the next office over.
00:32:04 Indeed.
00:32:05 So if you're like an
00:32:06 engineering firm and you use
00:32:07 like, let me see,
00:32:08 what do we got?
00:32:09 Use like,
00:32:10 UGNX 10 files.
00:32:11 Like that's,
00:32:12 that's a file type.
00:32:13 And you want,
00:32:14 you want to get into a person
00:32:15 who uses step files.
00:32:16 And you're trying to collaborate
00:32:17 on like development of some
00:32:18 engineering project.
00:32:19 Like you could use our,
00:32:20 our software to like,
00:32:22 you put in your file type,
00:32:24 it gets piped over to them.
00:32:25 And on the way,
00:32:26 it translates the file to the
00:32:28 step type or something.
00:32:30 So yeah, that's,
00:32:31 that's what it does.
00:32:32 And that's what I work on.
00:32:33 Just hand break it, bro.
00:32:34 Just hand break it pretty much.
00:32:36 I mean, unironically,
00:32:37 I mean, that's the interesting
00:32:38 thing.
00:32:39 Everything about what our
00:32:40 software does is,
00:32:41 and we have huge clients.
00:32:43 You know, like government agencies
00:32:45 and whatnot use the program for
00:32:46 various reasons.
00:32:47 Oh God, the 3D models of the
00:32:48 nuclear launch codes are being
00:32:49 transcoded.
00:32:50 It all comes back to it.
00:32:51 The 3D models all the codes.
00:32:53 It's like numbers.
00:32:54 They're just numbers.
00:32:55 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:32:56 No one ever looked at a 3D model
00:32:58 for it.
00:32:59 It's so ingenious.
00:33:00 Encrypted.
00:33:01 I mean, being on the development
00:33:02 end, like everything we do,
00:33:03 like you could replicate,
00:33:04 you could just like do it on
00:33:05 your own, like for every file.
00:33:06 But the problem is when you're
00:33:07 sending like thousands of
00:33:08 gigantic files, like you want
00:33:10 someone to streamline the
00:33:12 files.
00:33:13 Really, if you think about it,
00:33:14 everything in life that we buy
00:33:15 is kind of just a streamlining
00:33:16 so that you can save your time
00:33:17 and not have to, you know,
00:33:19 grow your own food and produce
00:33:20 your own shit.
00:33:21 You have to buy the seeds and
00:33:22 buy the stuff.
00:33:23 Well, that's what they say.
00:33:24 You spend, when you're a kid,
00:33:25 you spend time to save money.
00:33:26 And when you're an adult,
00:33:27 you spend money to save time,
00:33:28 something, something.
00:33:29 I learned that from Hippo, I
00:33:30 think.
00:33:31 Oh yeah, that's something I
00:33:32 think.
00:33:33 It's true.
00:33:34 Yeah, I'd never heard that
00:33:35 before.
00:33:36 But it's true.
00:33:37 I always think about that
00:33:38 mostly when it comes to video
00:33:39 game piracy and the insane
00:33:40 high-level hacking I would do
00:33:42 to like my PSP to be able to
00:33:44 get free games.
00:33:45 And it was dope as shit.
00:33:46 And I'd do it again in a hard
00:33:47 beat.
00:33:48 It was super fucking dope.
00:33:49 I keep thinking like,
00:33:50 is this going to be the day that
00:33:51 I finally eBay a PSP
00:33:53 and jump back into that?
00:33:56 Dude.
00:33:57 I'm going to play the Japanese
00:33:58 version of the Bleach fighting
00:33:59 game a year before it came out
00:34:00 again.
00:34:01 Man, I got some of that shit on
00:34:02 my fucking DS.
00:34:03 There was like a DS fighting
00:34:04 game.
00:34:05 But like, the world was my
00:34:06 oyster.
00:34:07 Back when I first got into like
00:34:08 ace cards for my DS.
00:34:11 Dude, this stuff is the shit.
00:34:14 I still stand by it.
00:34:15 The DS, I think, is the
00:34:16 greatest, at least
00:34:17 handheld device of all time.
00:34:19 And probably my favorite console
00:34:20 literally of all time
00:34:22 because of the ace card.
00:34:23 There was so much good shit for
00:34:24 it.
00:34:25 Being able to play Quake 1,
00:34:26 the PC game,
00:34:27 ported onto the DS,
00:34:29 it was fucking the best.
00:34:31 It sounds like such a Wild West.
00:34:33 It was amazing.
00:34:34 I played Mother 3,
00:34:35 you know, whatever it was.
00:34:36 Really?
00:34:37 Like translated?
00:34:38 On my PSP, actually.
00:34:39 It was on my PSP.
00:34:40 Yeah.
00:34:41 Damn.
00:34:42 There's a fan made dub
00:34:43 of Western.
00:34:44 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:34:45 And it was dope.
00:34:46 It was like, it was fantastic.
00:34:47 It was fantastic.
00:34:48 I actually played it on a GBA
00:34:49 emulator on my PSP.
00:34:51 I played Mother 3
00:34:53 and it was one of the best
00:34:54 experiences on that thing.
00:34:55 You know what?
00:34:56 The entire time we're playing
00:34:58 Mother 3 on my PSP,
00:34:59 I was like, man, this just
00:35:00 isn't the same.
00:35:01 I wish I could play this.
00:35:02 Hold it in your hands with your
00:35:03 PSP, dude.
00:35:04 I can do it.
00:35:05 I can do it.
00:35:06 Have you ever considered?
00:35:07 All right.
00:35:08 So you know, you remember back
00:35:09 in the day with the PSP,
00:35:10 you got a memory stick
00:35:12 or I didn't use an SD card.
00:35:13 I had a memory stick.
00:35:14 Because Sony is all about
00:35:15 making proprietary formats
00:35:16 so they can get more money.
00:35:18 And those things are
00:35:19 super fucking expensive.
00:35:20 Nowadays, they have
00:35:22 micro SD
00:35:24 to memory stick adapters.
00:35:25 So imagine just getting like
00:35:26 128 gig fucking micro SD
00:35:29 slotting into your PSP
00:35:30 and putting like every game
00:35:32 ever on your PSP.
00:35:33 Yeah.
00:35:34 That's the dream.
00:35:35 Times have changed.
00:35:36 We didn't have that shit back then.
00:35:37 That's why I'm like, oh fuck.
00:35:39 Because like I'd have like
00:35:40 an eight gig card
00:35:41 and feel like a god.
00:35:42 Like I can have three games
00:35:43 on here.
00:35:44 I know, right?
00:35:45 God.
00:35:46 PSP.
00:35:47 It was too early.
00:35:48 It was too early.
00:35:49 The technology now.
00:35:50 We can fucking crush it.
00:35:51 Yeah.
00:35:52 That's true.
00:35:53 That's true.
00:35:54 Oh.
00:35:55 What warm times.
00:35:56 We're going to get a cubic ninja
00:35:57 port to switch.
00:35:58 That's what I want to know.
00:35:59 Speaking of Sony PlayStation,
00:36:03 recently, the other day,
00:36:05 I replayed Ratchet and Clank 2
00:36:07 because I just feel like,
00:36:08 I just feel like nostalgic
00:36:10 playing the same five video
00:36:12 games I've played my entire life
00:36:13 and I will never play anything new.
00:36:16 And I've realized that
00:36:18 a lot of that game is dog shit,
00:36:21 actually.
00:36:22 Oh no.
00:36:23 Like the game is fun
00:36:24 and it's really nice
00:36:25 and all that.
00:36:26 But like I was paying attention
00:36:27 to the story
00:36:28 and when you're a kid
00:36:29 you don't really understand
00:36:30 anything that's going on.
00:36:31 You see the jokes
00:36:32 and you go,
00:36:34 but that's it.
00:36:36 There's a lot of
00:36:38 dead ends
00:36:39 and nothing character-wise.
00:36:40 And I was thinking back
00:36:41 to the first game.
00:36:42 Well, like the whole thing
00:36:43 is about Ratchet and Clank.
00:36:45 They are characters they have.
00:36:46 They start off,
00:36:48 like not really,
00:36:49 they're unsure about each other.
00:36:50 They have a falling out
00:36:51 and the story is about them
00:36:53 as characters having a character arc
00:36:56 and by the end of the game
00:36:57 they're best friends
00:36:58 and that's that.
00:37:00 And they're pretty much wrapped up
00:37:01 at the end of the first game.
00:37:02 Yeah.
00:37:03 And in the second game
00:37:04 there's like themes hinted at
00:37:06 but nothing happens.
00:37:08 And it's just,
00:37:09 it was just sad to think.
00:37:11 Like they get transported
00:37:12 to another galaxy
00:37:14 and Ratchet is like,
00:37:15 ah man, I'm not a hero.
00:37:17 It's boring being,
00:37:18 having nothing to do.
00:37:20 And he goes to another planet,
00:37:21 another galaxy
00:37:22 and he gets a hero task
00:37:23 and he's like, oh sick.
00:37:25 And then
00:37:26 he does stuff,
00:37:27 he gets clank,
00:37:29 there's cutscenes
00:37:30 with funny bits in them.
00:37:31 Indeed.
00:37:32 And there's like,
00:37:33 there's like a,
00:37:34 there's a female
00:37:35 longbacks lady
00:37:36 who's got,
00:37:37 who's really hot.
00:37:38 Hell yeah.
00:37:39 Hell yeah.
00:37:40 Before going somehow.
00:37:41 But, and there's like
00:37:42 very, very, very slight hints
00:37:44 that Ratchet may like her
00:37:45 or like he does like her.
00:37:47 And it doesn't go anywhere
00:37:48 and Angela never like
00:37:49 reciprocates that at all
00:37:50 and then it ends
00:37:51 and that's the end.
00:37:53 It's just like,
00:37:55 it's such a shit story.
00:37:56 It's like,
00:37:57 this is the reason
00:37:58 why Ratchet and Clank
00:37:59 is not really considered
00:38:00 a classic.
00:38:01 Yeah.
00:38:02 It's like,
00:38:03 it's just a,
00:38:04 it's just a fun game
00:38:05 from, from back in the day.
00:38:06 And it sucks to,
00:38:07 to realize that,
00:38:08 oh, I guess,
00:38:09 I guess it actually
00:38:10 wasn't that good.
00:38:11 I guess this is the reason
00:38:12 why this is not like
00:38:13 a Metal Gear Solid 2
00:38:14 or anything.
00:38:15 This is,
00:38:16 this Ratchet and Clank.
00:38:17 I've always felt,
00:38:18 yeah,
00:38:19 I definitely,
00:38:20 I love Ratchet and Clank 1.
00:38:21 I played 1 through 3
00:38:22 and really enjoyed them,
00:38:23 but I felt a big,
00:38:25 I never felt the kind of
00:38:26 attachment to the game.
00:38:27 Like he,
00:38:28 you know what he feels like?
00:38:29 This is the best way I can describe it.
00:38:30 He really feels
00:38:31 like a PlayStation All-Stars character
00:38:33 as opposed to like a Smash Bros.
00:38:35 character.
00:38:36 That's a,
00:38:37 that really sums it up right there.
00:38:38 Say with like Kratos and,
00:38:40 well, no, no,
00:38:41 Kratos has like
00:38:42 loads of character
00:38:43 and story and stuff.
00:38:44 I mean, I suppose,
00:38:45 but I,
00:38:46 Like, have you seen,
00:38:47 have you seen Jesse's video about it?
00:38:48 I haven't even played him,
00:38:49 but like,
00:38:50 Jesse's explanations.
00:38:51 Kratos is pretty cool.
00:38:52 In that video he did.
00:38:53 But I have played them.
00:38:54 So here's my expert opinion.
00:38:56 Kratos,
00:38:57 well, that's the thing.
00:38:58 Kratos, just like in,
00:39:00 just like Ratchet and Clank,
00:39:01 for their first game,
00:39:02 like narrative,
00:39:03 I'll say masterpiece.
00:39:05 Like it's just,
00:39:06 it's great.
00:39:07 It's like solid and fantastic.
00:39:08 We get everything we need
00:39:09 out of the character.
00:39:10 Like everything after that
00:39:11 is basically wasting my time
00:39:13 with the character.
00:39:14 Like, oh,
00:39:15 he's still sad about killing his family.
00:39:16 He really wants revenge on the cops now.
00:39:18 You have the same problem
00:39:19 with the rest of the God War games
00:39:20 you have with the Don't May Cry games
00:39:21 because David Jaffe
00:39:22 was only involved in God of War One.
00:39:24 You know, honestly,
00:39:25 that's, I think that's part of it.
00:39:27 Although, I mean, to be fair,
00:39:28 like Devil May Cry,
00:39:29 when it changed,
00:39:30 like it changed into a thing
00:39:31 that a lot of people liked
00:39:32 even more than the first one.
00:39:33 So, you know, some people are,
00:39:35 I really want to spend some time
00:39:37 like getting deep into Devil May Cry
00:39:40 technical shit.
00:39:41 Cause I mean,
00:39:42 I feel like that's
00:39:43 well-loved.
00:39:44 You'll be a better player than me
00:39:45 cause I never fucking went down
00:39:46 that rabbit hole.
00:39:47 I have other things to do.
00:39:48 That's so surprising to me
00:39:49 that you're such a big fan
00:39:50 and yet you're not like,
00:39:51 I don't know, like,
00:39:52 isn't that the main draw of the game?
00:39:53 Um, I guess.
00:39:54 But I mean,
00:39:55 Other things, I guess.
00:39:56 I mean, my whole thing with games
00:39:57 that says I've never,
00:39:58 I've never played a hard video.
00:40:01 I've never played a video game
00:40:02 and felt accomplished doing it
00:40:03 because deep down I know
00:40:04 it's a waste of time.
00:40:05 So, I play them to have fun
00:40:07 not to get any sense
00:40:08 of accomplishment from it.
00:40:09 Maybe someone like me
00:40:10 is just better at like
00:40:12 ignoring that reality.
00:40:14 I guess.
00:40:15 It's very possible.
00:40:16 It could be.
00:40:17 Have you considered that
00:40:18 playing video games
00:40:19 is useful for making video games?
00:40:22 It is.
00:40:23 That's why I'm playing them
00:40:24 way more now
00:40:25 than I have been
00:40:26 for the last couple of years.
00:40:27 I was watching,
00:40:29 I was compulsively re-watching
00:40:31 all of Matthew Matosis's videos
00:40:33 ever made.
00:40:34 Of course.
00:40:35 Naturally, the other day.
00:40:36 And I was on the Mario,
00:40:38 the first Mario 64 video.
00:40:40 And I was just scrolling
00:40:41 through the comments
00:40:42 and someone was like,
00:40:43 I wonder, someone said,
00:40:44 and I don't know,
00:40:45 tell me what you think about this,
00:40:46 I wonder how much of Miyamoto's
00:40:47 ingenuity comes from
00:40:48 how much he doesn't play games.
00:40:51 How much is the fact that
00:40:53 Mario 64 was such a
00:40:56 groundbreaking title
00:40:58 that basically defined
00:41:00 a new way for characters
00:41:01 to move in 3D?
00:41:03 I wonder how much of that
00:41:04 came from him not being my...
00:41:06 I definitely feel...
00:41:08 I guess in that case
00:41:09 there was no template
00:41:10 he could have even looked at.
00:41:12 But it wasn't the only time
00:41:14 that he did that,
00:41:15 that he pretty much
00:41:17 just sort of came up with
00:41:18 a whole new fucking game type
00:41:20 out of whole cloth.
00:41:22 And show me the game
00:41:24 with more developed
00:41:25 movement controls
00:41:26 than Mario 64.
00:41:27 Show me the game
00:41:28 with better, more fleshed out,
00:41:30 interesting movement mechanics.
00:41:32 Mario 65.
00:41:34 I forgot, of course.
00:41:36 I definitely feel like
00:41:37 there's that aspect of game developers
00:41:40 who didn't play games
00:41:42 when they were younger
00:41:43 because they didn't really exist.
00:41:44 Maybe there was Pong
00:41:46 or whatever, Atari stuff.
00:41:48 And they have an idea
00:41:50 and they get into programming
00:41:52 and they make it.
00:41:53 He's gonna be crazy.
00:41:54 Just throw this out there.
00:41:55 My mom was alive
00:41:57 when Pong, the first video game ever,
00:41:59 was released when she was young.
00:42:01 First video game ever.
00:42:02 Well, actually, the first video game ever
00:42:04 was Tennis for Two on the Oscilloscope.
00:42:07 Okay, well, close.
00:42:09 Get fucking destroyed.
00:42:11 It's crazy.
00:42:12 But nowadays,
00:42:13 there's a lot of people in the gaming industry
00:42:15 who lose stoner idiots
00:42:17 who played video games
00:42:19 and now they're in the gaming industry
00:42:22 doing a job
00:42:23 in a huge company
00:42:25 that is overblown and bloated
00:42:27 and nobody has any artistic vision
00:42:29 because they're stupid.
00:42:30 You know what's a great comparison to this?
00:42:33 Like Hideo Miyazaki.
00:42:35 Is that right?
00:42:36 Ghibli guy?
00:42:37 Did I say his name right?
00:42:38 Whatever his fucking name is.
00:42:39 Hidetaka Miyazaki.
00:42:40 Hidetaka Miyazaki.
00:42:41 Okay, right.
00:42:42 I mean, he's very much a...
00:42:44 Did he actually say anime was a mistake?
00:42:46 Is that like an actual quote?
00:42:47 Is that like a joke?
00:42:48 No.
00:42:49 Well, so that's Ghibli man.
00:42:51 Okay, pretty sure he did actually say that.
00:42:53 I mean, it was in a larger context.
00:42:55 Right, right.
00:42:56 Well, I mean, I'm trying to get to his larger context.
00:42:58 Okay, Miyazaki, whatever his fucking first name is,
00:43:00 from Ghibli,
00:43:01 he's very much a critic
00:43:03 of Otaku culture in anime.
00:43:06 It's Hideo Miyazaki.
00:43:07 Hideo Miyazaki.
00:43:08 Yes, thank you.
00:43:09 I'm a fucking idiot.
00:43:10 Me as a...
00:43:11 Right, from soft game.
00:43:12 That's the Hidetaka.
00:43:13 Okay, anyway,
00:43:14 like he's very much a critic of the sort of incestuous slurry
00:43:18 that is like modern anime development.
00:43:20 And obviously not everything's that way.
00:43:22 Like Maiden Abyss was a real breath of fresh air and whatever.
00:43:24 All this cool stuff.
00:43:25 But like the kind of incestuous slurry
00:43:28 that is like modern anime...
00:43:31 Say it one more time.
00:43:33 Incestuous slurry.
00:43:34 Yeah.
00:43:35 Yeah.
00:43:36 It's excellent.
00:43:37 Homestuck.
00:43:38 And like this really reminds me of
00:43:41 this kind of game development approach.
00:43:43 Because fucking Miyamoto seems to have a very similar approach.
00:43:46 I think I've heard him say,
00:43:47 like, you know, he makes games from a life well lived
00:43:50 and like experiences had.
00:43:52 Whereas like, I don't know,
00:43:53 what do modern game makers do?
00:43:55 They grew up playing video games
00:43:56 and they want to make, you know...
00:43:57 Want to make more...
00:43:58 An iteration of...
00:43:59 Like another video game.
00:44:00 It's...
00:44:01 It's...
00:44:02 What am I trying to say?
00:44:03 There's this sense that if you only...
00:44:07 If you don't broaden your like the input,
00:44:10 like the output could only be a lesser quality of the input.
00:44:13 Right.
00:44:14 If you know what I mean.
00:44:15 Like if you don't live a life in the real world,
00:44:17 when you make fiction,
00:44:18 it's only going to be worse than the fiction you have consumed.
00:44:22 And to give him a little credit,
00:44:23 I get that games are more like technical
00:44:25 than like a movie, for example.
00:44:27 Like you have to, you know,
00:44:28 there's a lot of just beats and bites.
00:44:30 You've got to crunch to get that shit all
00:44:32 working the right way so it can be tough.
00:44:34 But I mean, I think we all,
00:44:35 we're all hungry for innovation and whatnot.
00:44:37 Like I think that the Securo sword play,
00:44:40 I know it wasn't the first to do it,
00:44:41 but like it was the first game that I've ever played.
00:44:44 I'm sure there's others that really made me feel like
00:44:46 this is like how a sword duel like would kind of work.
00:44:50 And again, I know it's not a one for one perfect.
00:44:52 I'm just saying it feels like a much further step forward.
00:44:55 There was some...
00:44:56 There was like the PvP sword play game.
00:44:58 Oh, you're talking about For Honor?
00:44:59 For Honor, I think it's a game.
00:45:00 Yeah.
00:45:01 Where they have all those,
00:45:02 sort of, that was pretty cool from what I know.
00:45:05 My only defense to that is that I didn't play it
00:45:07 so I can't speak on it,
00:45:08 but I, if that's like better than great.
00:45:10 However, Securo is like the most aesthetic game of all time.
00:45:13 It's the same, it's the same idea.
00:45:15 Like the idea of blocking in a specific direction.
00:45:18 Like back in the day,
00:45:20 you couldn't account for such precision with your animations
00:45:24 and stuff in 3D.
00:45:26 You just, if you swing nearby an enemy,
00:45:28 then you hit it.
00:45:29 That's that.
00:45:30 In other words, you can get the model clanging
00:45:32 with another model very accurately.
00:45:35 Hey, here's a transition story.
00:45:36 All that new stuff is all possible.
00:45:38 Don't.
00:45:39 Because we've entered a new era of indie games that...
00:45:44 That's true.
00:45:45 Just are...
00:45:46 That's the real innovation there.
00:45:47 Trying to correct dark magic and evil.
00:45:51 So you've got games like being developed by indie creators.
00:45:55 Like, rolled out.
00:45:57 And rolled out.
00:45:58 You want to Google it.
00:45:59 It is a Super Monkey Ball game
00:46:01 made by fans of Super Monkey Ball
00:46:03 and Rom had creators of Super Monkey Ball.
00:46:05 So basically,
00:46:07 Monkey Ball stopped making good Monkey Ball.
00:46:09 So the fan said,
00:46:11 we'll take care of this.
00:46:12 We will.
00:46:13 Exactly.
00:46:14 So they're making a new IP,
00:46:15 but it is exactly the same as a Monkey Ball.
00:46:19 Right.
00:46:20 I mean, that's the same with like the...
00:46:22 Ega made his own like Castlevania.
00:46:24 Because Konami just stopped making
00:46:26 2D Castlevania people.
00:46:27 Something, something.
00:46:28 Mighty number nine.
00:46:29 Something, something.
00:46:30 And that story is not uncommon anymore.
00:46:33 In fact, it's sort of almost common in a way.
00:46:36 So you've got stuff like rolled out.
00:46:38 You've got stuff like what you just said, Nate.
00:46:39 You've got stuff like that Pokemon game
00:46:41 that's going to be coming out.
00:46:42 And you've got less direct,
00:46:44 but still highly influenced games.
00:46:46 Stuff like Shovel Knight and Herdew Valley,
00:46:48 where there's no one game that it brought us up from.
00:46:50 But still, you know,
00:46:51 heavily derivative from games that's come before.
00:46:54 And you know, that's obviously been the case.
00:46:55 It's been the case and will be the case forever.
00:46:57 But a lot of indie games,
00:46:59 well, many games are extremely large,
00:47:02 you know, subset of games.
00:47:04 So I will say, I would say,
00:47:06 I am seeing a lot of indie games
00:47:09 that are simply,
00:47:11 the video game companies have
00:47:13 betrayed our trust.
00:47:15 They've betrayed what we like about certain IPs
00:47:18 and certain game genres.
00:47:20 And so we are just going to do it better.
00:47:22 So to be fair to the companies,
00:47:24 it might just be that the market shifted around them
00:47:26 and that they're just fucked
00:47:27 because the model they used to use doesn't work anymore.
00:47:29 And they're slowly, you know.
00:47:31 What do you mean? Explain.
00:47:33 Well, I mean, like,
00:47:34 what I think about like Square Enix, for example,
00:47:36 like, I don't think they do it on purpose
00:47:38 to release a Final Fantasy like every like 10 years.
00:47:41 And that they're like thrilled about that or anything.
00:47:44 But I think that they feel pressured,
00:47:46 you know, rightly or wrongly,
00:47:47 that like we have to make it be like the most beautiful game.
00:47:50 Like we have to make it be like a big,
00:47:53 gigantic, you know, world-expanding 3D action.
00:47:56 I think that they feel, they don't have to.
00:47:59 I think they feel they have to.
00:48:01 Yeah, I definitely think there's
00:48:03 there's like a fucking AAA game development.
00:48:09 You can't say that way. You have to say AAA.
00:48:12 You got to be Jim Stirling about it.
00:48:14 It's the only way to say it.
00:48:15 Yeah, big games, whatever.
00:48:18 There used to be different types of games
00:48:20 and now those types of games aren't AAA big games
00:48:24 like platforms, like Wretched and Clank
00:48:26 was a AAA game of its time.
00:48:28 But you can't make a Wretched and Clank game nowadays
00:48:30 because it'd be very niche because
00:48:32 that's true, the market has shifted.
00:48:35 So people, they want to fill as niches
00:48:38 because they like those games.
00:48:39 They just don't get made.
00:48:40 Oh, look at this.
00:48:41 Look at this rolled out fucking mouse and a ball.
00:48:43 Yeah, it's a mouse and a ball or a hamster.
00:48:46 It's fucking great.
00:48:47 It's even called a love letter to Super Monkey Ball.
00:48:49 Yeah, there you go.
00:48:50 It's so fucking cool.
00:48:51 That's like, you know, like isn't it fucking sick
00:48:53 that like technology's gotten to the point
00:48:55 where just like people with a dream can make
00:48:57 exactly what took like millions of dollars
00:48:59 like 10 years ago?
00:49:00 Indeed it is, Tom. Indeed it is.
00:49:02 It's pretty sick.
00:49:03 The barrier to entry is so much lower.
00:49:05 I mean, in a sense.
00:49:07 Yeah, you're totally right.
00:49:09 Go play Run Away from Snakes.
00:49:11 That would have cost millions of dollars
00:49:12 to make 20 years ago.
00:49:13 Yeah, I ironically want to make like
00:49:16 not like a giant game,
00:49:18 but like a wretched and clank-esque
00:49:20 like run around with punk in a three year old platform.
00:49:22 Oh, give her like a costume change
00:49:23 where like you can be like Indiana Jones cosplaying
00:49:25 and you're like, oh, these fucking snakes, bro.
00:49:27 I'm running from the fucking snakes.
00:49:29 Hell yes.
00:49:30 Give her a hand.
00:49:31 Yes.
00:49:32 For some reason it sounds like there was like an echo
00:49:34 on the run away from the snakes.
00:49:36 And if I didn't please a villain fall.
00:49:38 A little bit of oblivion.
00:49:40 Oh, yeah.
00:49:41 How you doing, oblivion?
00:49:42 This is my quick call out.
00:49:43 Man, fuck you.
00:49:44 Congrats again on winning oblivion fall.
00:49:45 I'm calling you out oblivion.
00:49:47 Man, I'm calling you out.
00:49:48 Fuck you.
00:49:49 Man, fuck you.
00:49:51 Man.
00:49:52 What are we talking about?
00:49:53 Roll out?
00:49:54 Kill yourself.
00:49:55 Hey, I'm not oblivion fall.
00:49:56 I'm your only friend.
00:49:57 You gotta stick with me, buddy.
00:49:59 Delete everyone else's audio except for Ben.
00:50:01 We gotta stage a coup.
00:50:02 We gotta stage a PCP coup.
00:50:04 I've got a hot transition ready
00:50:06 and it's that, you know, modern games development
00:50:09 reminds me similarly to like,
00:50:12 again tied back to the whole Hideo Miyazaki thing.
00:50:15 It reminds me of like the big fucking Marvel movies.
00:50:18 Like those like the big appeal to everybody,
00:50:20 but we've lost like, like why do we watch the Marvel movies?
00:50:23 Like, because I watched the last Marvel movie
00:50:25 and I gotta know what fucking happens.
00:50:27 I broke the cycle.
00:50:29 I broke the cycle.
00:50:30 I'm free.
00:50:31 You're not watching Endgame?
00:50:32 You're breaking out?
00:50:33 Well, I didn't watch any Marvel movies forever.
00:50:36 Basically.
00:50:37 Well, okay.
00:50:38 So there wasn't even a cycle to break.
00:50:39 I watched the Avengers assemble.
00:50:40 Yeah, pretty much.
00:50:41 Not for a long time.
00:50:42 I watched Avengers assemble
00:50:43 and that's basically it.
00:50:44 Yeah.
00:50:45 I didn't watch any of them
00:50:47 except for fucking, you know,
00:50:49 Infinity War and now Endgame.
00:50:51 Wait, wait, wait.
00:50:52 You skipped right to Infinity War?
00:50:53 That damn right I did, Ben.
00:50:54 What?
00:50:55 Damn right I did.
00:50:56 Because Infinity War is just the best one.
00:50:58 Although, to be fair,
00:50:59 I want to go watch Guardians of the Galaxy
00:51:00 because here those are actually good.
00:51:01 Guardians of the Galaxy is sick.
00:51:02 Civil War is fucking, not Civil War.
00:51:04 Winter Soldier is fucking sick.
00:51:05 I don't believe you.
00:51:06 Okay, that might be fair.
00:51:07 My friends are big fans of a,
00:51:09 not Thor Dark World.
00:51:10 Ragnarok?
00:51:11 Ragnarok, Ragnarok.
00:51:12 Is that the, maybe.
00:51:13 I think it might be Ragnarok.
00:51:14 That's the third one where he gets short hair
00:51:16 and it's like,
00:51:17 I mean, Ben doesn't know.
00:51:18 I don't know.
00:51:19 I don't know.
00:51:20 I just, they say that it's like really weird
00:51:21 and like not very weird.
00:51:22 It's the generally consensus good one.
00:51:24 Yeah.
00:51:25 Like they embrace the humorous aspect
00:51:27 of Chris whatever the fuck
00:51:28 his name's worth.
00:51:29 Chris Hemsworth.
00:51:30 Yeah, yeah.
00:51:31 And incidentally,
00:51:32 okay, let's, I guess let's get into
00:51:33 a little bit of spoilers for Endgame
00:51:34 if anybody cares.
00:51:35 Now you know.
00:51:36 I sure loved Fat Thor.
00:51:39 I thought it was, you know what,
00:51:41 love way too, way too strong a word
00:51:43 of how I felt about Fat Thor.
00:51:45 I enjoyed and got some chuckles
00:51:47 out of Fat Thor.
00:51:48 Yeah.
00:51:49 That seems fair.
00:51:50 And I was surprised.
00:51:51 So that was cool.
00:51:52 The forces of nature have conspired
00:51:55 to make this for sure
00:51:57 the last Marvel movie I will ever watch.
00:52:00 Now this may be,
00:52:01 I think a lot of people probably feel that way.
00:52:03 I know that they do for a lot of reasons.
00:52:06 Like everybody's retiring.
00:52:07 Like everybody's retiring.
00:52:08 Come on, man.
00:52:09 There's two more Spider-Man movies after this.
00:52:11 You gotta go see Spider-Man.
00:52:12 Whatever, Spider-Man.
00:52:13 I don't even know who that is.
00:52:14 That's probably good.
00:52:15 I like Spider-Man.
00:52:16 Spider-Man, the only good Spider-Man
00:52:17 is the first one.
00:52:18 You mean with the
00:52:20 Sam Raimi.
00:52:21 That's the first one.
00:52:22 I'm planning my flag in the sand here.
00:52:24 I unironically love the MCU
00:52:26 and I watched all of them.
00:52:27 Yeah.
00:52:28 This may surprise some people.
00:52:31 I've actually like
00:52:32 kept up with Marvel pretty.
00:52:34 I wouldn't say,
00:52:35 I've not seen every single movie.
00:52:37 I wouldn't say I've even seen half the movies.
00:52:39 But from like,
00:52:40 basically since the first Avengers,
00:52:43 I've seen the big ones.
00:52:45 So like, you know,
00:52:46 I've seen all the Avengers.
00:52:47 I've seen all the group ones.
00:52:48 And I've seen a few,
00:52:50 you know,
00:52:51 a lot of the standalone ones.
00:52:53 Here's my thing.
00:52:54 I've been watching the Marvel movies
00:52:56 since X-Men in 2000
00:52:58 before it was full.
00:53:00 Because I've loved comics
00:53:02 since I could read.
00:53:04 So this isn't like me getting on the hype train
00:53:06 of like, oh man, this is the new thing.
00:53:08 There's just the thing I've always loved
00:53:10 since the womb just happens to be
00:53:12 in the public spotlight right now.
00:53:14 Well, that's great.
00:53:15 When everybody's shuffled away
00:53:16 and they don't give a shit about Marvel anymore,
00:53:18 I'm still going to be there with three other people
00:53:20 as they ruin everything
00:53:21 and drive it onto the ground.
00:53:22 I'm going to make an angry rant about it on YouTube.
00:53:25 I'll still be there.
00:53:26 I look forward to that.
00:53:27 I think about there is a store in Boston
00:53:30 that I always walk past and it always makes me think.
00:53:33 There's a Harry Potter store
00:53:35 on Newberry Street
00:53:36 that is just taking you to Harry Potter
00:53:38 as an IP.
00:53:40 It is the wizard store.
00:53:42 And I always walk by it and I think,
00:53:44 how glorious must it be
00:53:47 to have the thing that you like
00:53:49 have an entire store
00:53:51 dedicated to it.
00:53:53 That it's such a large force
00:53:56 in culture that you're able
00:53:58 to just go to a full store.
00:54:00 That's why every day on the Harvard Square
00:54:02 in that curious George store.
00:54:04 Yeah.
00:54:05 There's a curious George store.
00:54:07 There is one curious George store in the world.
00:54:09 The one and only world famous.
00:54:10 And I brought Munchie to it.
00:54:12 Holy shit.
00:54:13 How curious.
00:54:14 I think we've gone to it like basically every single time
00:54:16 we've gone to Harvard Square.
00:54:17 Well, where else is there even to go?
00:54:18 What else is there to see?
00:54:20 Literally nothing.
00:54:21 I start typing in Boston curious
00:54:24 and it auto-completes Boston curious George store.
00:54:28 That's what I want to say.
00:54:29 Here's the meme bin
00:54:30 hanging out in Boston Experience.
00:54:32 I go to Harvard Square.
00:54:34 We meet in the tea station.
00:54:35 We walk out.
00:54:36 I'm always scoping out for soccer guy.
00:54:38 I'm always looking out
00:54:39 praying to God that we'll see him.
00:54:40 We never do.
00:54:41 Soccer guy has yet to re-emerge.
00:54:43 He fucking devalues.
00:54:44 We walk and get Mexican food
00:54:45 and then we go to the curious George store.
00:54:47 Then we go back to his house.
00:54:48 That's the way it goes.
00:54:49 Is curious George like a Boston thing?
00:54:52 Like a product of Boston?
00:54:53 Like they made it from there or something?
00:54:55 I think it's British, isn't it?
00:54:57 I thought so too.
00:54:58 Yeah.
00:54:59 Well, it was from continental Europe.
00:55:01 I think it was from some fucking Belgian, I think, or something like that.
00:55:04 Okay, I was just wondering.
00:55:05 Why is there a store in Boston?
00:55:07 What's the store behind the store, Monchi?
00:55:09 Give me the lowdown.
00:55:10 Wait, why are you asking him?
00:55:11 I read a plaque.
00:55:12 This is probably a butcher.
00:55:13 I'm sorry about all the curious George fans.
00:55:15 All the curious heads
00:55:17 who are just going to fucking put their fingers for it.
00:55:21 The huge contingent of curious heads in our audience.
00:55:25 Not just because it was the George heads,
00:55:28 aka the last king of England.
00:55:30 All the George heads out there,
00:55:32 where I'm not talking about you guys, stop.
00:55:35 The American colonists were not a George, let me tell you.
00:55:38 But anyway, from what I understand, they fled.
00:55:42 By the way, curious George was created by two German-born Americans.
00:55:45 Okay, exactly.
00:55:46 So there were some people fleeing the Nazis in Europe, two Germans,
00:55:52 and then they fled to America.
00:55:54 And I believe they landed in Boston in the Harvard area
00:55:57 and distributed curious George there.
00:56:01 If I recall correctly, they had ridden curious George,
00:56:05 or at least a prototype beta version of curious George.
00:56:09 And then one of the few possessions they brought to America
00:56:13 were those huns.
00:56:14 It was curious huns.
00:56:15 It didn't catch up.
00:56:16 They didn't get in touch with the youth.
00:56:18 Curious Hitler did not.
00:56:20 Curious, curious Adolf.
00:56:22 Oh, that Adolf was pretty curious, let me tell you.
00:56:24 He had some big ideas.
00:56:26 He was really curious about some questions.
00:56:28 Which questions?
00:56:29 You want to try a few ideas out.
00:56:31 Let me read you some curious George facts.
00:56:33 When the first story, Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys,
00:56:37 was published in France in 1939, George was named Fifi.
00:56:41 In the United Kingdom, George was originally called Zozo in 1941,
00:56:45 apparently to avoid using the name of then-king George VI.
00:56:49 No way!
00:56:50 Okay.
00:56:51 He came out in America, I think, so they changed the name.
00:56:55 Okay, yeah, no, no.
00:56:56 I think in America he was originally George, from the very start.
00:56:59 Okay, okay, cool.
00:57:00 Oh my God.
00:57:02 It all comes back around like a mobious strip.
00:57:06 Curious George, fucks curious George,
00:57:09 and they come to make a new curious George over and over again.
00:57:12 You know those bugs in the East Coast?
00:57:16 They have brooding seasons.
00:57:18 Their entire lives are to live and fuck for like three seconds.
00:57:22 So you go to a gas station in Virginia,
00:57:24 and then you just covered your car,
00:57:26 and everything is littered with bug corpses and bugs fucking.
00:57:30 That's what curious George is like in all aspects
00:57:33 that could possibly be considered.
00:57:35 What are we talking about?
00:57:36 Marvel movies, man.
00:57:37 We're talking about movies.
00:57:38 She's so mean.
00:57:40 Hey, movies, right?
00:57:42 Marvel?
00:57:43 Sure.
00:57:44 I haven't been keeping up with them,
00:57:46 but I realized that, you know, I liked the first Captain America.
00:57:50 You know, it's not like I think that they suck,
00:57:54 or that I'm avoiding them deliberately.
00:57:56 I also like the first Captain America.
00:57:58 I think the reason I'm not even trying to get into it
00:58:02 is because there's just not enough female representation
00:58:05 in these movies.
00:58:06 Oh, that's true.
00:58:08 There's this push to get more females in movies or in media,
00:58:12 but there's not enough push to get females in good media,
00:58:16 and Marvel movies would have been-
00:58:17 Dude, not enough push to get more female CEOs.
00:58:19 Hip-hop, you're way off base right now,
00:58:21 and you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
00:58:23 Did you go see Captain Marvel?
00:58:26 Did you go see the Avengers Endgame
00:58:30 where they had an all-lady scene?
00:58:33 I basically said that as a meme.
00:58:35 The point is that there's just all big,
00:58:40 mostly guys doing cool things, and that's fine.
00:58:44 And I'm gay, and that works for me.
00:58:46 The Avengers is good.
00:58:47 I had my fill.
00:58:49 I've seen Thor and Iron Man 1 and 3,
00:58:52 and it's like, yeah, this is good stuff.
00:58:54 Captain America, that was cool.
00:58:55 But I don't need too much extra more of that.
00:58:59 If there were more female superheroes that were cool
00:59:02 and not just supermodels with a sword,
00:59:05 like actually cool, designed characters and stuff,
00:59:08 imagine Gun Girl as a superhero.
00:59:10 Imagine Kit Kars, but with Gun Girl.
00:59:13 I'd watch that.
00:59:14 I mean, that's cool.
00:59:15 Isn't that like Kit Girl?
00:59:16 It does sound like Hit Girl a little bit.
00:59:18 Hit Girl from Kit Kars?
00:59:20 Yeah, I'll watch that video game.
00:59:22 I mean, I guess.
00:59:24 I suppose my only pushback to this in any way
00:59:27 is just like, okay, people go write great stories
00:59:30 about female characters that I can't wait to know.
00:59:32 I just, ironically, would like more movies
00:59:35 that feature female characters that are just written good
00:59:38 because I don't see enough of those.
00:59:40 They always seem to get panicked.
00:59:42 The bottleneck is just that there aren't enough
00:59:45 beloved female superheroes from the classic era
00:59:48 to mine for modern content.
00:59:50 I'd recommend watching Jessica Jones
00:59:52 the first season on Netflix if it's still on there
00:59:55 and Disney hasn't pulled it.
00:59:56 That was a good Marvel show.
00:59:58 It was about a female private investigator
01:00:00 who has superpowers.
01:00:01 What's a superpower?
01:00:02 Just out of curiosity.
01:00:03 She's just like strong and shit.
01:00:05 Okay.
01:00:06 Sick.
01:00:07 Strong female, you say.
01:00:09 Sounds like token representation to me.
01:00:11 Strong female characters, yes.
01:00:13 Wonderful.
01:00:14 That was a really hilarious feminist joke the other day
01:00:16 that actually made me laugh.
01:00:18 Feminist joke pick one, am I right?
01:00:20 Indeed.
01:00:21 Yo, listen to this feminist joke.
01:00:23 Or is it a tautology?
01:00:25 Well, that'll be for you to judge.
01:00:27 Okay, here it is.
01:00:28 It was just like a tweet from a feminist.
01:00:30 And it was simply this.
01:00:32 It was like, man says to doctor as he hands him
01:00:35 his newly born daughter.
01:00:37 He says, you know, I kind of feel like this is just
01:00:39 over pushing the whole female thing.
01:00:41 Why did we need to go with like a daughter in this?
01:00:43 It just feels forced and uncomfortable.
01:00:45 I mean, like why do we need, and I was like,
01:00:47 okay, this is actually funny.
01:00:49 Yeah.
01:00:50 I laughed.
01:00:51 I laughed.
01:00:52 Insert any social minority or any group of any kind.
01:00:57 I mean, Nate with his non-black wife
01:00:59 is handed a black child and Nate says in response,
01:01:02 yeah, I just kind of feel like this is like forced,
01:01:04 you know, black, like, you know, this just,
01:01:06 why do we have to go with this direction?
01:01:08 Believe me.
01:01:09 It was very easy.
01:01:11 It's really like it's really easy to joke about all that.
01:01:15 Like fucking token female stuff.
01:01:18 And I heard that Wonder Woman was a good movie.
01:01:20 I might watch that.
01:01:21 It was.
01:01:22 It's basically just that I like powerful female characters
01:01:26 as in like good characters that are cool
01:01:28 and have risk and all that.
01:01:30 There's just none of those in like things outside of
01:01:33 Undertale at the moment.
01:01:35 What the fuck somewhere?
01:01:37 Wait, stop.
01:01:38 You're saying there are no strong women female characters
01:01:42 outside of Delta Rune and Undertale specifically.
01:01:45 You got the monopoly.
01:01:46 We got to break it up.
01:01:47 We got to break it up.
01:01:49 You know what I mean?
01:01:50 Like in the sphere of like big budget stuff,
01:01:53 like Hollywood.
01:01:54 I mean, I guess there's fucking Cat Marvel.
01:01:56 I mean, I suppose.
01:01:58 I've heard that that's not a very good movie.
01:02:00 It wasn't great.
01:02:01 Wonder Woman apparently is a good movie.
01:02:03 Jessica Jones on Netflix is fucking lit.
01:02:05 You got all those like Charlize Theron movies
01:02:07 where she kicks people's asses.
01:02:09 Fortunately Vapors 3 is almost done.
01:02:12 Oh my God.
01:02:13 That's a female character.
01:02:14 Yeah.
01:02:15 Only a few more pages to go on that.
01:02:16 Now hang on.
01:02:17 And I've been cranking them out.
01:02:18 If only someone would make a film adaptation of The Champion.
01:02:20 Well, that's great.
01:02:21 Then is it fair to describe Magda as a strong female character?
01:02:24 Because she seems to have some pretty serious anxiety.
01:02:26 She's strong.
01:02:27 I mean, what do we mean by strength here?
01:02:29 She's strong.
01:02:30 You know what it means.
01:02:31 You know that it doesn't mean that.
01:02:33 Stop.
01:02:34 I don't mean like powerful.
01:02:35 Well-realized, well-defined.
01:02:36 Well, okay.
01:02:37 Wait.
01:02:38 Is a character.
01:02:39 Not written to be merely a sex thing.
01:02:41 Okay.
01:02:42 Wait, wait, wait.
01:02:43 So is the question here.
01:02:44 Is the quandary.
01:02:45 Can a character be a strong female character
01:02:47 if she is written to be weak?
01:02:50 Like emotionally and in terms of like will and stuff.
01:02:52 Yeah.
01:02:53 I mean, I would think so.
01:02:54 I mean, no, right?
01:02:55 Yes.
01:02:56 Maybe you just don't understand what strong means.
01:02:58 Of course.
01:02:59 I'm shocked.
01:03:00 Nate, I'm shocked and appalled.
01:03:01 Strong female character.
01:03:02 This is like a whole thing that like I thought we were,
01:03:04 I thought we as society had understood.
01:03:06 Okay.
01:03:07 That a strong female character doesn't mean someone
01:03:09 who is a badass.
01:03:10 It means someone who just.
01:03:11 Well, yeah, yeah.
01:03:12 Like to me, it literally just means a well-written
01:03:14 female character.
01:03:15 Okay.
01:03:16 Well, so if you've got like, for example, like a mom
01:03:18 in some show who's, I don't know, whatever,
01:03:20 she's like a mom and she's like really competent
01:03:22 and good at stuff.
01:03:23 And maybe she has an interesting backstory
01:03:25 and whatever.
01:03:26 Okay.
01:03:27 Sure.
01:03:28 Strong female character.
01:03:29 But like, what if we just have like a biopic
01:03:30 about like a, like a depressed, sad,
01:03:33 I don't know, like disempowered girl
01:03:35 and like, sure, we get way into her backstory
01:03:37 and we learn all about her,
01:03:38 but like everybody walks all over her
01:03:40 and let's just say this is a sad movie where she has
01:03:42 no arc where she gets over it.
01:03:44 It's just kind of a portrait into her sad life.
01:03:46 And she is.
01:03:47 That would be a tragedy.
01:03:48 We will describe her as like weak-willed and whatnot.
01:03:50 Is that a strong female character?
01:03:52 I think it, well, I mean, I guess it depends
01:03:54 how people want to use the phrase.
01:03:56 To me, the answer is yes.
01:03:58 Well, okay.
01:03:59 I guess good female character would be a better way.
01:04:01 I mean, I'd probably go with that.
01:04:02 But I mean, whatever.
01:04:03 I get the idea.
01:04:04 Well, you know, I don't know.
01:04:05 Maybe when people say strong female character,
01:04:06 they do mean like a fucking badass superhero
01:04:08 that they can look up to.
01:04:09 Look, isn't the idea that otherwise,
01:04:10 why wouldn't they just say good?
01:04:12 I think there is a contingent of people who do that
01:04:14 because like, if you look at like female characters
01:04:16 that have been introduced in like comic books
01:04:18 and like popular media as of recently,
01:04:20 they're always like borderline Mary Sewish
01:04:22 that like they just are invincible
01:04:24 and conquer everything and don't face challenges.
01:04:26 Isn't that just what superheroes are like?
01:04:28 I mean, not all.
01:04:29 Well, I mean, not true.
01:04:30 Lots.
01:04:31 Like most superheroes are Mary Sewish.
01:04:33 I think a great example of this in comic books
01:04:36 was Riri Williams as the female Iron Man.
01:04:39 Everybody just instantly loved her.
01:04:41 She was smarter than Tony Stark,
01:04:43 even though she was like a little kid.
01:04:44 Everyone just like saying her praises.
01:04:46 Nobody mistrusted her.
01:04:47 And it was just like, it felt very artificial
01:04:49 because like she's a black girl.
01:04:51 So she cannot, if we say anything bad about her,
01:04:53 we're racist.
01:04:54 So we can't do that.
01:04:55 So she's definitely strong in that sense, right?
01:04:57 Right.
01:04:58 But this is like not a well-developed character.
01:05:00 I mean, that's what I would consider
01:05:03 like a misunderstanding of the desire
01:05:05 for more strong female characters.
01:05:06 Your character is only as strong as the adversity
01:05:08 they overcome.
01:05:09 And if they...
01:05:10 Oh yeah, that's true.
01:05:11 Like the reason I like characters like...
01:05:14 I mean, nobody knows what gun girl's personality is like.
01:05:17 She shoots people and she's really angry all the time.
01:05:21 And she's a total badass, you know, all that stuff.
01:05:24 But she's like really like emotionally distraught
01:05:27 and fucked up and that's what is cool about her.
01:05:29 Okay.
01:05:30 Like she has a lot of mental problems
01:05:32 and she doesn't know how to love people.
01:05:34 She shoots them, you know, she kills them.
01:05:36 She's an RFCK character, you know?
01:05:38 So like a lot of superheroes that are good
01:05:40 are people who are, you know, they're super powerful
01:05:42 but they can't deal with their real life
01:05:45 or like they have, you know, Tony Stark is a good example
01:05:48 because he's such an asshole all the time.
01:05:50 Is he really that?
01:05:51 Well, he's snarky, I suppose.
01:05:53 He's a snarky piece of shit and he's like...
01:05:55 He finds it difficult to be genuine or to, you know...
01:05:58 He gets so worked up in his work
01:06:01 that he doesn't have time for social stuff
01:06:03 and he feels depressed at certain times.
01:06:05 Like it's just more interesting, the more human.
01:06:08 Spider-Man is the classic example of a superhero
01:06:11 who is like...
01:06:12 The strong female character.
01:06:13 Yeah.
01:06:14 Who's like got all the power but his real life
01:06:16 is all fucked up because of it.
01:06:18 Or he can't fix his real life because even the spider...
01:06:21 Is there any...
01:06:22 Spider powers.
01:06:23 In the term, strong female character
01:06:25 isn't part of the kind of idea behind that
01:06:27 like an inspirational figure?
01:06:29 Yeah, I guess.
01:06:30 I think so.
01:06:31 I guess.
01:06:32 A lot of time.
01:06:33 There's aspiration there.
01:06:34 Isn't the idea that we wanted to depict
01:06:36 like strong women on screen so that little girls
01:06:38 would be like, I can do that too.
01:06:40 Well, yeah, it's not to show...
01:06:42 It's not like literally...
01:06:44 I mean, in my...
01:06:46 I'm aware it's not so direct.
01:06:47 It's not like they have to be physically strong
01:06:50 or mentally strong.
01:06:51 Yeah.
01:06:52 They have to have a flaw and overcome it.
01:06:54 That's like a normal hero character or thing.
01:06:56 Let me tell you, you show me...
01:06:57 You show me a quote-unquote strong female character.
01:06:59 I'll show you a woman I can choke out real fucking quick.
01:07:02 Just fucking choke her out.
01:07:04 Like if there was like a female character
01:07:07 who was a superhero,
01:07:08 she's like Captain Marvel or whatever.
01:07:10 And she has like a crippling social...
01:07:12 Oh my god, you're talking about Jessica Jones.
01:07:14 Just go watch Jessica Jones.
01:07:16 I'll go watch it.
01:07:17 I mean, I don't have Netflix and I never will
01:07:19 and just pirate it.
01:07:20 Since there's ambiguity,
01:07:22 I guess I'm gonna keep using it just to mean
01:07:25 like a strong female character
01:07:27 is just a well-written relatable character.
01:07:29 I think that's what it should be.
01:07:30 Okay, but that may introduce confusion.
01:07:32 Give, another thing you should definitely check out.
01:07:34 Well, I'm not introducing confusion.
01:07:36 There's already confusion.
01:07:37 I mean, that's true.
01:07:38 People are already using the word multiple different ways.
01:07:40 That's true.
01:07:41 That's true.
01:07:42 Tom, yeah.
01:07:43 Hey, oh god.
01:07:45 Tom was gonna say something to me.
01:07:47 Before we wrap up on this topic,
01:07:49 I don't know if you've played it yet,
01:07:51 but something that would probably hit all these notes
01:07:53 and also be your fucking aesthetic
01:07:55 beyond good and evil for PS2,
01:07:57 you should play it.
01:07:58 Oh, I've heard of that.
01:07:59 She's got green lipstick.
01:08:00 Yeah, her name's Jade.
01:08:02 I almost keep saying Jade Empire,
01:08:04 but her name is Jade.
01:08:05 It's fucking sick.
01:08:06 It's got like this hand-painted,
01:08:08 low-poly, PS2, gorgeous aesthetic,
01:08:11 and the main character is a chick,
01:08:13 and she's cool,
01:08:14 and she's like a journalist-photographer kind of thing,
01:08:16 but she also has this cool staff.
01:08:17 You beat the shit out of stuff.
01:08:18 You try to unlock undercover, conspiracy shit.
01:08:20 It's fucking lit.
01:08:21 You should play it.
01:08:22 You play as Anita Sarkeesian.
01:08:24 Yeah.
01:08:25 That's correct, Ben.
01:08:26 That's correct.
01:08:27 Right.
01:08:28 I should make clear that this is not because
01:08:31 I have high moral standards.
01:08:33 It's literally just because I see a lot of characters,
01:08:36 and sometimes I also like to see a sexy one also.
01:08:39 Right.
01:08:40 I like girls.
01:08:41 Women are just sex objects to hypocrite.
01:08:42 You heard it here, folks.
01:08:43 That's all he wants.
01:08:44 I'd like to see boobs on the screen,
01:08:47 as well as a relatable character.
01:08:48 You know, is that so much to us?
01:08:49 It's great when you can have both, I suppose.
01:08:51 It's the standard meme.
01:08:52 It's like if you're going to be staring at someone's ass
01:08:54 for like 10 plus hours,
01:08:55 and I also would be one you like to have.
01:08:57 I reject that framing.
01:08:58 No, this is a nightmare.
01:09:00 This is a fucking...
01:09:01 This is a patriarch we've done.
01:09:02 Hey, I'm just being real.
01:09:03 We were doing so well,
01:09:04 and then we became a patriarchal nightmare
01:09:05 in the snap of the finger.
01:09:06 Look, I'm a proud member of the patriarch,
01:09:08 a card carrying to my grave.
01:09:11 Patriarch?
01:09:12 Hey.
01:09:13 I feel like it would be disingenuous of me
01:09:15 to not mention that that is part of it.
01:09:18 Sure.
01:09:19 That's fair.
01:09:20 That's fair.
01:09:21 Thanos is so dumb now.
01:09:23 He's like so mean.
01:09:24 Dumb and thick is what he is, my dude.
01:09:26 Support our regressive politics.
01:09:28 Dude, straight up when Thanos was farming
01:09:31 in his fucking white t-shirt and ripped jeans,
01:09:34 I straight up got hard and pre-compromise.
01:09:37 I'm just going to say, I orgasm to the theater.
01:09:40 I'm not joking.
01:09:41 Support our regressive politics at patreon.com
01:09:43 slash the pro-crastinators patriarch.
01:09:47 The pro-women-crastinators?
01:09:48 That's what I have to say.
01:09:49 The pro-LGBTQ-crastinators?
01:09:50 That was a good cap to the ad.
01:09:52 Was me coming to Thanos.
01:09:54 Dude, okay.
01:09:56 It's not weird.
01:09:57 He just was in like relatable clothing.
01:10:01 You mean like when he was at his farm?
01:10:04 Yeah.
01:10:05 He was wearing his fucking...
01:10:06 He was wearing his pure cotton,
01:10:08 like, you know, marbled, gray and white t-shirt.
01:10:11 His ripped jeans.
01:10:12 Always his heather gray, heather gray.
01:10:14 He was old and greasy.
01:10:15 He just, he was eating.
01:10:16 Listen, it's not weird.
01:10:17 He wasn't wearing his space farmers.
01:10:19 Wait, was Thanos in jeans and a t-shirt?
01:10:21 Yes.
01:10:22 That's what we're saying, yes.
01:10:23 It was not jeans, goddammit.
01:10:24 Yes, it was.
01:10:25 It totally fucking was.
01:10:26 It was skinny jeans.
01:10:28 Nice.
01:10:29 I don't think he could wear skinny jeans.
01:10:31 He's too dummy.
01:10:32 Oh, he made it work.
01:10:33 Oh, yeah.
01:10:34 Thick jeans.
01:10:35 Well, this has been thoroughly unpleasant.
01:10:36 Hey, guys.
01:10:37 Let's, let me just fuck it.
01:10:39 I'm gonna fuck it right up.
01:10:40 Okay.
01:10:41 Let's just fucking, let's fucking go.
01:10:42 Hey, trans athletes, trans women in female athletics, acceptable?
01:10:48 Probably not, no.
01:10:50 Discuss.
01:10:51 Okay, considering the fact that we have, in terms of our leagues, we've made a distinction
01:10:56 between men and women's, like, leagues, that having people who, let's just, I mean, they're
01:11:02 somewhere on the border between, in some capacity.
01:11:05 I'm just saying it adds complexity, and I don't know.
01:11:08 I've heard some people suggest a trans league, because it just, I mean, I don't know.
01:11:12 That seems kind of, you know, shitty as well.
01:11:14 I mean, that would just end up being a trans woman league.
01:11:17 And the other option, considering that men outperform women in base, in almost every
01:11:21 athletic capacity.
01:11:22 There's no solution that makes everybody happy, because like, if you just say, oh, let's have
01:11:26 everybody compete together, then I'm sorry, but women are just gonna lose.
01:11:28 You know, okay, here's what I find, here's what I find interesting about this.
01:11:32 I watched a YouTube video about it the other day, and I was like, hmm.
01:11:35 What I find interesting about this question is, one of the arguments for it, right, some
01:11:39 of the people that are like, no, we should let them compete, is like, well, people already
01:11:43 have natural advantage, right?
01:11:45 Like, some people have longer legs than others, and those people are just natural.
01:11:48 Like, should we say, oh, well, people whose legs are too long shouldn't be able to compete?
01:11:52 Why, then we say, oh, well, if you were born a man, then you shouldn't be allowed to play,
01:11:56 just because that gives you, like, you know, a statistical advantage.
01:11:59 More testosterone, bigger hands, whatever the fuck.
01:12:02 Imagine me competing in basketball versus, like, Michael Jordan, like, you know, if that's
01:12:07 quote-unquote unfair, you know?
01:12:09 I have a solution in my head.
01:12:11 I don't agree with that line of thought that leads to, therefore, we should allow trans
01:12:16 women to dominate the, wait, let me finish, to dominate the female, like, sports leagues,
01:12:20 but I do think that it kind of highlights just the inherent unfairness of the entire,
01:12:25 you know, just the entire enterprise.
01:12:27 There's something of a naturalistic, I guess, fallacy when it comes to this stuff, but yeah.
01:12:31 Maybe this is like, it couldn't be put into practice for most things.
01:12:37 But, like, surely if there are, like, you know, some people are naturally more gifted than
01:12:44 others, and it's like, gender is becoming less of a thing.
01:12:48 Men and females, like, if you're a man or a woman, go here or there.
01:12:52 Really, what separates the top from, you know, the women from the men, generally, is that
01:12:58 the men are usually stronger, more athletic.
01:13:01 What if, instead of separating them at the start by male or female, you separate them
01:13:07 by their performance?
01:13:09 So, like, there's, like, a bracket, like, a heavyweight or a, you know, whatever.
01:13:12 Well, it's then, like, in, like, 99% of cases, then the top bracket will just be men, and
01:13:18 maybe trans women.
01:13:20 Yeah, like, that's, that would be how it would usually go.
01:13:24 But that would make it so that trans people could just go to wherever they, like, physically
01:13:30 are capable, regardless of what gender they, you know, ascribe themselves.
01:13:34 They can just be in, like, somewhere on the list.
01:13:37 The problem with that is that then, you know, the category to watch is the top category
01:13:42 of performance, and that's men.
01:13:44 I'm not sure it is.
01:13:46 Isn't that already a problem, though?
01:13:48 Like, men's sports already supremely outperform women's sports across the board.
01:13:54 And I mean, you know, that's no, that's no grand conspiracy.
01:13:57 It's just that, you know, the men just do better.
01:14:00 Nobody said it was a grand conspiracy, Nate.
01:14:02 Yeah, okay.
01:14:03 Okay, okay.
01:14:04 Well, you know, it's a biological difference.
01:14:06 Like, I know that it would be basically the same thing, except the...
01:14:12 Oh, wait, to be fair to my point, women might be, like, promoted less.
01:14:15 So, perhaps there is something to be said for that.
01:14:17 I get it.
01:14:18 Go on.
01:14:19 Go on.
01:14:20 I just feel like if the gender thing is the problem, and it's, like, kind of controversial
01:14:27 and, like, maybe unfair in certain situations or maybe all situations to, you know, say
01:14:36 to a trans person that you're not literally allowed because we don't, you know, society
01:14:41 doesn't believe that you are the gender that you think you are or, you know, you've decided.
01:14:46 If the difference is in physicalness and not gender, and gender is just usually, you
01:14:52 know, it's a safe bet that a man would be stronger than a woman, therefore, separate them.
01:14:56 I think separating on something other than gender will solve at least the controversial
01:15:02 nature of it, if you know what I mean.
01:15:04 Well, you know what I've heard?
01:15:05 I've heard a thought.
01:15:06 Basically, yeah, like, we could either get broader and, like, you got two ways to go.
01:15:09 You can get broader and just say, like, everybody competes.
01:15:11 But the thing is that, yeah, I mean, it's going to make it harder for some people.
01:15:14 Women athletes will have a fucking tough time with that.
01:15:17 The reason we have men and women's leagues is because there is a significant performance
01:15:23 gap that would basically mean that women can't compete.
01:15:26 So the only thing you can do is you have to atomize, and currently we atomize basically
01:15:30 on men and women, but, like, I've heard proposals that, like, let's atomize on specifically,
01:15:35 like, we measure your testosterone and we use your, or, like, you have to be within a
01:15:39 certain range of testosterone.
01:15:40 You know, it's interesting you bring that up.
01:15:41 But there's so many more things than just testosterone that do it.
01:15:43 Yeah, yeah.
01:15:44 Testosterone alone does not account for all the differences.
01:15:48 Of course.
01:15:49 Of course not.
01:15:50 Well, Nate, it's interesting that you bring that up because I was about to bring it up
01:15:52 because I saw a news story and I didn't read it because I didn't care.
01:15:56 I didn't know this was going to be coming up on the PCV.
01:15:59 But there was a story of, like, some athlete who was a natural born woman and she just
01:16:03 happened to have extremely high levels of testosterone.
01:16:06 Right.
01:16:07 See, that's the thing.
01:16:08 I saw that on Twitter.
01:16:09 She got disqualified.
01:16:10 Yeah.
01:16:11 That's fucked up.
01:16:12 Like, that's straight up doing the thing, like, oh, well, people whose legs are too long
01:16:17 can't compete in basketball because they're too naturally abandoned.
01:16:20 That throws a whole other fucking fan of worms into this.
01:16:22 See, there is no good answer here.
01:16:24 There is no good solution.
01:16:25 I mean, I think my answer is the goodest because it, you know, ultimately, not much will change,
01:16:32 but for the people that it doesn't, like, the normal male-female gap doesn't necessarily
01:16:37 apply to, like a woman who's got a lot of testosterone is really strong, who can compete
01:16:41 with men, can, like, fight their way up to the top of that bracket or whatever.
01:16:47 No, no, no, you're pretty much just proposing that we eliminate the gender divide in the
01:16:54 inathletic league.
01:16:55 I mean, which is how, well, I mean, yeah, I guess you could argue that, but, like, we
01:17:01 all, we have women's leagues for a reason and it's because they would be, they would
01:17:05 generally, in most events, they just, they just wouldn't play.
01:17:08 Sure.
01:17:09 And I think on the one hand, that is a problem, obviously.
01:17:12 But on the other hand, I think if all you really care about purely is merit and, like,
01:17:17 there's only, like, two or three percent, you know, women participation, that means those
01:17:21 two or three percent are good enough to compete and then you have as close to an equal playing
01:17:26 field as you can get.
01:17:27 I mean, the thing is, it's a nice idea in theory that it should be entirely a meritocracy.
01:17:34 Yeah.
01:17:35 But I understand the rationale for dividing the league to give, you know, more people
01:17:42 the chance to.
01:17:43 It's a very damned if you do, damned if you don't, because right now you have, you have
01:17:46 the women's league being pissed off because they get paid less than, like, nobody cares
01:17:49 as much, but if you did the meritocracy thing, they'd be pissed off at, like, nobody could
01:17:53 make the cut.
01:17:54 They would be out of the league.
01:17:55 You know, I ever hear the story about the universal tennis ranking or whatever, and Serena Williams
01:18:00 once said, like, you know, I'll beat any man.
01:18:02 But, like, in the universal tennis ranking, she's, like, below, like, the top hundred,
01:18:07 because, you know, it's all fucking guys and some, like, I don't know, she was offered
01:18:11 a chance to, like, fight some, like, college senior, like, like, not a pro, but like a guy.
01:18:15 And I think she returned it down.
01:18:17 She's like, no, I can't beat this guy.
01:18:18 Or, you know what?
01:18:19 I might be misrepresenting her point, but the point is, like, they're different.
01:18:22 Men are different.
01:18:23 It's just, yeah, it's unfortunate, but it's the sad reality.
01:18:26 And I, like, I'm being, I don't know, I guess I'm being feminist to hear, like, I don't
01:18:30 want to fuck over women in that way.
01:18:32 And I have great empathy for trans people, too.
01:18:35 But it's just, but how do we make a fair system?
01:18:37 And I have no idea.
01:18:38 I have no idea.
01:18:39 But then, yeah, I don't know.
01:18:40 Like, I've heard, I don't know.
01:18:41 This video that I watched about it was, like, a couple of trans women, like, placed really
01:18:48 highly in, like, oh, fuck, it was like an Olympic qualifier, I think, for, like, a sprinting
01:18:53 contest.
01:18:54 And they pushed out that girl, right?
01:18:55 Yeah, yeah, they pushed, they pushed out, like, this other girl.
01:18:58 And it's like, I don't know, doesn't seem right, you know?
01:19:01 Well, Nate, it's interesting you bring up that example with, like, the, what's your name,
01:19:05 is, like, a hundred places below on the universal tennis thing.
01:19:08 Because if the gap is that wide, and we let trans athletes participate, like, over time,
01:19:14 that'll just mean, like, all the benchmarks for women's athletics will just be out of
01:19:18 reach for naturally born women.
01:19:20 Bro, bro, just the other day, a, a, what, I can't determine, sorry, it's like a male trans,
01:19:25 like, okay, biologically one, whatever.
01:19:27 No, no, wait, the other way, sorry, a biological male trans woman competed in, like, a weight
01:19:34 lifting competition.
01:19:35 I don't forget the deals.
01:19:36 But, like, shattered, like, every fucking record they have, because pure weight lifting is,
01:19:41 like, one of the biggest ways men have a huge advantage over women, and just, like, like,
01:19:46 what's going on?
01:19:47 I figured it out.
01:19:48 I figured it out.
01:19:49 You rename the, the brackets, cis male, cis female.
01:19:53 But that's, that's, that's, I guess, just, like, outwardly, quote, unquote, discriminatory?
01:19:57 Well, that, well, that would, that would basically mean you'd have to then have a trans
01:20:00 league.
01:20:01 I don't want trans people to not be able to compete, it's just, but there's...
01:20:04 No, no, no, no, no, the, the, the, you can, you, cis male plus trans...
01:20:09 So, you'd have, you'd have a trans female participate with cis male, because biologically
01:20:14 they were male to start?
01:20:16 I mean, like, like, if, if, like, I didn't care about, like, people's feelings, that's
01:20:22 one of the ways.
01:20:23 Now you're speaking my language.
01:20:25 Well, like, I guess it makes sense.
01:20:26 That's the way it has to be done.
01:20:27 Like, okay, okay, I, I guess it would make sense, right?
01:20:29 If, if, like, the, the metrics or whatever say that, like, biological men prefer better
01:20:33 men in a sport, and therefore, if you, you know, you got this one league, and you, maybe
01:20:38 you call it the men's league, but you, like, it's, like, women can compete in it, right,
01:20:45 including trans women.
01:20:46 Yeah.
01:20:47 And then you got the female league, and, like, but, like, only, well, no, that's...
01:20:51 I don't see any solution here.
01:20:53 That's exactly...
01:20:54 I think the thing that's, that's interesting is...
01:20:57 Well, I guess the solution is that, well, I guess that is allow trans women to compete
01:21:02 in the men's league at, I mean, that's, you know, that's basically just saying, well,
01:21:07 for all intents and purposes, biar sports, you are men.
01:21:10 Which, I mean, maybe for the, maybe for the sake of, of competition, that's just something
01:21:16 you gotta do.
01:21:17 Yeah.
01:21:18 And if, like, there's any, because, like, the trans women that perform and break all
01:21:23 the records, they're quite strong, obviously.
01:21:25 Of course.
01:21:26 Because, like, the most, the strongest female people, they could, they could rip me in half
01:21:30 in any sport.
01:21:31 Any sportswoman could, could, like, fold me in, like, origami, you know?
01:21:36 Indeed.
01:21:37 Indeed.
01:21:38 So, like, what if a, a, like, a scrawny man like me, a small person would to, to, to,
01:21:44 male to female transition, they would be more female, like, biologically, like, musculature,
01:21:50 like, maybe they have more potential to, to grow based on, on, I don't fucking know,
01:21:56 chemicals or whatever.
01:21:57 But, like, it seems to be the only ones I ever hear about are male to female people
01:22:02 who break super records.
01:22:03 There's never, like, any trans women who go into the sport who are sort of, like, middle
01:22:08 of the range or low, you know, tier, like, bronze medal winners.
01:22:11 We probably just don't hear about them.
01:22:13 They're, they're disadvantaged.
01:22:14 Well, they wouldn't be breaking records if they were, if they were switching the other
01:22:18 way.
01:22:19 The sort of people who, like, if they performed in a men's tournament, they would do terribly
01:22:25 and if they performed in a female tournament, they would still not do perfectly.
01:22:29 Yeah.
01:22:30 Like, we don't see any of that.
01:22:31 And there's this, there's this, there's this, like, idea in the back of people's heads that,
01:22:36 like, what if you're, you're transitioning, you've always wanted to be a sports person
01:22:40 and this is just, like, a good opportunity to win some medals.
01:22:43 That's, like, that's, that's, like, really, like, a mean thing to think.
01:22:47 Yeah.
01:22:48 Yeah.
01:22:49 It's, it's just, I don't know.
01:22:50 There's no solution, bro.
01:22:52 We're not getting anything.
01:22:53 Everything we've thought has been a complete dead end.
01:22:55 What's, what's interesting, yeah, what's interesting to me, though, is, is, it's that argument
01:22:59 about, like, well, it's not fair to begin with.
01:23:02 So I, whatever, fuck it.
01:23:04 And it's like, well, yeah, you're right.
01:23:06 It's not fair.
01:23:07 It's not fair that some people are taller.
01:23:08 Some people got more tea.
01:23:09 Some people got whatever.
01:23:10 But if you just follow that logic to its conclusion, then you have to question the entire institution
01:23:15 of male and female leagues.
01:23:17 You absolutely do.
01:23:18 So, like, yeah.
01:23:19 You have to question the entire idea of sports in general.
01:23:22 That's true, that's true.
01:23:23 Like, at the end of the day, isn't, isn't sporting, isn't athletics in the end just like,
01:23:28 just sort of a big institutionalized litmus test for who is the tallest and who is,
01:23:33 has the most muscular endurance and who has, like-
01:23:35 And frankly, take it to its extreme.
01:23:37 This really goes to all inequality of any kind.
01:23:41 None of us are our own designers.
01:23:43 None of us, I don't believe in free will.
01:23:45 I don't believe any of us have earned anything by, like, you know, any, whatever, like anything
01:23:49 we've done.
01:23:50 We're just programmed this way.
01:23:51 We didn't choose to be born with the genetics or the parents or the environment or the brain
01:23:55 state that we have at this very moment.
01:23:57 And so I guess this is where it kind of gets into, like, you know, more socialist stuff
01:24:00 of, like, nobody deserves anything.
01:24:02 So we need to equalize the experience because that's only fair.
01:24:05 And, like, there is logic there.
01:24:07 There is logic.
01:24:08 I mean, you say go to the logical extreme, but I don't think people generally do that
01:24:13 except in conversations like this.
01:24:15 Well, that'll be my counter to every time they bring it up.
01:24:17 Like, in any implementation of the things we've been talking about, nobody would ever
01:24:21 go to the logical extreme of anything.
01:24:23 They would always try to find some sort of compromise.
01:24:25 I don't know what idea you're putting forward, Nate.
01:24:28 Well, I'm saying that, like, the point of inequality there, it's like, I'm just saying
01:24:34 that on a larger level of, like, our entire lives, everything we do, basically, in life,
01:24:38 is a competition.
01:24:39 So, you know, I'm extrapoling beyond the sport thing.
01:24:41 I'm just saying.
01:24:42 Well, it doesn't have to be.
01:24:43 We kind of made it.
01:24:44 We kind of designed it that way, you know, capitalism.
01:24:47 Well, oh, right.
01:24:48 There was no competition before capitalism was invented.
01:24:51 It's not like people competed for resources or land control.
01:24:54 Oh, sure, sure.
01:24:55 Yeah, yeah.
01:24:56 I know lobsters have higher.
01:24:58 Good.
01:24:59 The point is, not everything has to be a competition, but I understand that, you know,
01:25:03 this natural, yeah, sports are naturally unequal as are many arenas in life.
01:25:10 What were we talking about?
01:25:12 I'm trying to understand.
01:25:13 I have one more point.
01:25:15 One more point about this, right, is that the reason that it would be unfair or, like,
01:25:21 it would suck to have everybody compete on an equal playing field, men and women in the
01:25:26 same sport league would be that men would win all the trophies and they would get the
01:25:30 champagne balls and, like, be happy and smiling.
01:25:33 Yes.
01:25:34 And women would never feel the success of having a gold medal around their neck and it would
01:25:39 suck.
01:25:40 I'm sure in some cases, but very rarely, yeah.
01:25:42 But, like, the argument there is that...
01:25:45 Neither will you or I.
01:25:46 Why would you do a sport if you don't win?
01:25:49 That is the argument.
01:25:50 Like, there's no reason to do the sport if you're not going to be the best of all time
01:25:55 in a world.
01:25:56 I mean, the goal is to win.
01:25:58 Hey, did you know that the NFL has no rule against female players and occasionally people
01:26:02 do try?
01:26:03 It's just that they never make it anywhere because, you know, they got disadvantages.
01:26:06 When are we going to...
01:26:08 Do we have any trans-female NFL players?
01:26:11 Oh, shit.
01:26:12 Would be my immediate question there.
01:26:14 Yeah, I mean, that could happen.
01:26:15 It's only a matter of time then, right?
01:26:17 I'm sure it could.
01:26:18 Probably could.
01:26:19 Yeah.
01:26:20 Seems inevitable.
01:26:21 Yeah.
01:26:22 By the way, I just want to shout out real quick.
01:26:24 In I Shield 21, the quarterback of the final guys that the devil bats fight against, their
01:26:33 quarterback is like the best quarterback in the world and she is a woman and she's like
01:26:37 the only woman on the team but she's just so good at quarterbacking and like, I think
01:26:40 this is the ideal we all want.
01:26:42 Is she just like so smart and tactical?
01:26:44 Is that her thing?
01:26:45 You know, I forget her specific like a football-based superpower which everyone has in I Shield 21.
01:26:51 God, I Shield 21 is the best.
01:26:52 I never got that far.
01:26:53 No, you should finish it.
01:26:54 It was so incredible.
01:26:55 Yeah, I want to reread it all the time.
01:26:56 It's so good and I love the art.
01:26:57 The art by One Punch Man, everybody.
01:26:58 Morata, who's doing the updated manga, just so everybody knows.
01:27:01 Because it's so weird to me that One Punch Man is like the thing everybody knows about,
01:27:04 not I Shield 21 now.
01:27:05 Okay, but anyway.
01:27:06 It never made it to the West due to its weird racial shit.
01:27:11 Well, maybe that's not the only reason.
01:27:14 I mean, frankly.
01:27:15 Well, sure it got scan-leaded, but that's not like a commercial release.
01:27:18 You're right.
01:27:19 I meant to say actually released.
01:27:20 Well, the racial shit in there is there, but in no way is it disparaging.
01:27:24 It's pretty similar to what we're saying here.
01:27:26 Can you explain to me the weird racial shit, please?
01:27:29 It's a little gauche.
01:27:30 Oh, Munchie, I'll tell you.
01:27:31 There is discussion.
01:27:32 They go into the inherent advantages of black people.
01:27:37 Being black.
01:27:38 Yeah, basically racist white coach just has to learn that, you know, in the end of the
01:27:43 day, black people are superior athletes and you gotta make people.
01:27:46 It is really funny.
01:27:47 I'm not kidding.
01:27:48 That's pretty much true.
01:27:49 It's pretty much true.
01:27:50 Oh, okay.
01:27:51 But it was like, I liked that because people shy away from that.
01:27:57 I mean, it is, you know, it does seem to be losing Kenyan, you know, I don't know.
01:28:00 Fucking look at football players in general.
01:28:02 You know, it's, you know, fact, fact, I heard this on the Internet.
01:28:05 The thing about Kenyans running, it's not just Kenyans.
01:28:08 It is a like the marathon runners.
01:28:12 It's a specific tribe from Kenya that is like disproportionately like good at marathon running.
01:28:18 Maybe that's a bad example.
01:28:19 But like, if you look at like, that's fine.
01:28:21 I just wanted to point that out as an interesting fact to it.
01:28:24 Yeah.
01:28:25 Okay.
01:28:26 I thought that was neat.
01:28:27 Well, all right.
01:28:28 That was relatively pleasant.
01:28:29 Yeah, I'll fucking, oh, just wait till after the show.
01:28:32 I'll fucking rip you apart.
01:28:34 Fucking.
01:28:35 Hey, I want to point out there is a, there are a couple of good videos.
01:28:38 There's a series of videos from SB, you guys know SB Nation?
01:28:41 I don't think so.
01:28:42 Well, it's the company that John Boyce, the guy who did 17776.
01:28:45 Right.
01:28:46 It's that company.
01:28:47 These videos are not by him, but there's a series called Beef History that goes into
01:28:53 like, oh, there's one about, there's one about A-Rod and God, what's fuck?
01:28:58 I forget who the guy that he had a long beef with.
01:29:01 That one's really good.
01:29:02 And there's another one about Serena Williams versus.
01:29:03 Jeter perhaps?
01:29:04 Yes.
01:29:05 Yes.
01:29:06 Jeter and A-Rod.
01:29:07 Jeter and A-Rod.
01:29:08 I thought you were talking about like the history of roast beef.
01:29:09 No.
01:29:10 I wish.
01:29:11 It's the, it's the, each video is like the history of a particular beef between two
01:29:15 like professional athletes.
01:29:16 Yeah, that's cool.
01:29:17 There's a good one about A-Rod and Jeter.
01:29:18 And there's another really good one about Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.
01:29:21 I'm not even a sports guy, but I like some of these, some of these, you know, because
01:29:25 these videos are about like the narrative.
01:29:27 Right.
01:29:28 It's about that human drama.
01:29:29 It is about that human drama.
01:29:30 Absolutely.
01:29:31 John Boyce just put, John Boyce put out a video maybe a week ago.
01:29:34 Oh God, I forget the title of it, but it is an examination of Bob's in sports as in just
01:29:40 like, he just tracks the prevalence of people named Bob in professional sports.
01:29:45 And it's weird because like you can see he tracks like in, like he tracks them like by
01:29:49 sport and like overall, and like there's a huge spike in Bob's and it's suddenly, like
01:29:54 there's only at its peak, there were like 600, there were like 600 Bob's in professional
01:29:59 sports.
01:30:00 Today, nine.
01:30:01 Bob's are dying out.
01:30:02 Oh my God.
01:30:03 It's a genocide.
01:30:04 It is.
01:30:05 It's a Bob.
01:30:06 This is the kind of Tism we need more of in the world.
01:30:08 And he goes through a couple of noteworthy Bob's like Bob's Cyclone who lost like four
01:30:14 15 professional boxing rounds and then retired having never won a single match.
01:30:19 Rest in peace, Bob.
01:30:21 But he kept showing up night after night.
01:30:23 That's, I respect that.
01:30:24 I respect that.
01:30:25 He put, he put the time in.
01:30:26 Too much Bob in, not enough weave in.
01:30:28 He was a Bob.
01:30:29 That's true.
01:30:30 He was a Bob.
01:30:31 He was a note in this symphony.
01:30:32 He mattered.
01:30:33 Fair.
01:30:34 True.
01:30:35 Valor.
01:30:36 What do you say we move on to the voicemails, lads?
01:30:39 Anybody, anything else?
01:30:40 Are we good?
01:30:41 I've been dying to move on to voicemails because it is a voicemail that I've listened to before
01:30:46 the show that I know you have picked.
01:30:48 Oh, you think so?
01:30:49 Okay.
01:30:50 I just guarantee it.
01:30:51 And I'm going to have a lot to say about it.
01:30:54 Oh, okay.
01:30:55 All right.
01:30:56 We shall see.
01:30:57 By the way, just so everyone knows, I basically just picked them and generally nobody listens
01:31:00 to them or like, you know, goes and checks on them beforehand.
01:31:03 As far as I know.
01:31:04 I, okay.
01:31:05 Well, I actually listened to a few of them beforehand.
01:31:08 What I'll do is I have notifications for the email for the procrastinators on my phone.
01:31:13 So I'll always get notifications when someone uploads a voicemail.
01:31:17 So if there's ever, listen, guys, if you want me to listen to your thing beforehand, if
01:31:22 you really care, then get a really catchy, like, munchy, please read, please listen to
01:31:28 this and then I will listen to it.
01:31:30 So there you go.
01:31:31 There's how you do it.
01:31:32 There's how you do it.
01:31:33 Although it's still, if you're not here for the episode, we probably still won't play it.
01:31:35 So it's, you're still kind of up in the air, but do your best, everybody.
01:31:39 Okay.
01:31:40 Let's move on.
01:31:41 Oh, before we get to the proper voicemails, we have a man on the case, a man on the hunt
01:31:46 for the pizza party podcast.
01:31:48 We've got some wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Nate, please before, before, before you say
01:31:53 that, I just want to say that before like yesterday night, I was driving around with my friend
01:31:59 who was in town again, and he turned to me and he said, said, munchy, so I've listened
01:32:04 to the PCP and my heart, my heart dropped.
01:32:06 To pity your stomach, yeah.
01:32:09 And he says, what is this, like, where's the podcast meme?
01:32:14 I don't know.
01:32:15 Where is it?
01:32:16 I started to sweat bullets and I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.
01:32:19 I don't know what you mean.
01:32:20 I don't understand what you're saying.
01:32:21 Denied, denied.
01:32:22 And then we're speeding down the highway and I get out of the car as fast as I can.
01:32:25 Yeah, that's better.
01:32:26 I start bromeling.
01:32:27 You know, ducking around.
01:32:28 Yeah, they roll down the incline.
01:32:31 Oh, well, maybe we'll be able to have some answers for him after we listen to this voicemail.
01:32:35 Okay, this is from Detective Kleiner Hut.
01:32:38 Let's see what he's got.
01:32:39 Go.
01:32:40 Greetings.
01:32:41 This is Detective Kleiner Hut.
01:32:43 I'm a detective for the Bureau of Foreign Investigation.
01:32:45 All right, so I've been getting a lot of foreign mail from an anonymous sender telling me about
01:32:51 the case of a lost podcast, the pizza party podcast.
01:32:56 Sounds interesting, but the hair up don't think it's important.
01:33:00 So I've decided to take the party case into my own two hands.
01:33:05 Problem is, I'm foreign and a tourist visa ain't gonna be enough to solve this case.
01:33:12 It's a looseness.
01:33:13 You guys just accepted gay marriage, so I beg of you.
01:33:18 I might have to give a swap or two.
01:33:20 I will become a homosexual for the case.
01:33:24 Detective Kleiner Hut, I'm going to the US for the pizza party case.
01:33:29 Tata for now, gentlemen.
01:33:31 Oh, and Pia.
01:33:33 Tata.
01:33:34 The moment God told me to bring my tiniest hat or bad things are gonna happen.
01:33:39 Huh.
01:33:40 What's that I want, huh?
01:33:42 Okay, so this guy, he's going gay so we can get a green card so we can come to the United
01:33:48 States and search for the podcast.
01:33:50 That's dedication.
01:33:51 That's, yeah.
01:33:52 He's willing to go full gay.
01:33:54 Yeah, he's going all the way full gay.
01:33:57 Maybe that's why I could never find the podcast because I wasn't willing to commit to that
01:34:01 level.
01:34:02 Yeah, that well.
01:34:03 You know, the problem with gays is just they're marketing.
01:34:05 The guy that adapted slogan, I've got one for you, go all the way, go full gay, TM, trademarked
01:34:11 and whatever.
01:34:12 Yeah, that's pretty good.
01:34:13 I think we'll get a lot of converts as a result of that one.
01:34:15 Just put that on the trans flag, like Times New Roman font up old.
01:34:19 Yeah, good idea.
01:34:20 Let's put that on a t-shirt.
01:34:21 Impact font.
01:34:22 Impact font.
01:34:23 White impact font.
01:34:24 Black border.
01:34:26 Dude, it's like a line structured like a meme.
01:34:29 So at the top it's go all the way and then at the bottom it's go full gay.
01:34:34 Exactly.
01:34:35 Exactly.
01:34:36 With an awkward penguin in the middle.
01:34:38 Yeah, you're able to stick an awkward penguin in there just for good measure.
01:34:41 Just throw that in there.
01:34:42 Just pick a poker dad.
01:34:43 Just pick a poker dad.
01:34:44 Like a Mr. Mayhem.
01:34:45 You know what?
01:34:46 You've got to put a different poker dad on each stripe.
01:34:47 Yeah.
01:34:48 You know what I mean?
01:34:49 Because they're different colors.
01:34:50 I prefer the slogan I came up for the gays with on I Am Games, I believe it was gay
01:34:55 the prey away and I stand by it.
01:34:59 That's excellent.
01:35:00 Yeah.
01:35:01 Now that opens up many deep avenues of philosophical inquiry.
01:35:06 And some atheist power move.
01:35:08 Okay, let's move on here.
01:35:11 We've got, speaking of this, we've got the real homosexual is calling in.
01:35:16 So let's see what you have to say.
01:35:17 This is the same guy calling in later after the last.
01:35:20 It might be.
01:35:21 It could be.
01:35:22 Let's see.
01:35:23 Go.
01:35:24 I'm going to be seeking some advice.
01:35:25 You see, I would like nothing more than to start a simple, modest, well speaking family.
01:35:32 But I can't reconcile this with the additional fact that I just fucking love the cock.
01:35:37 I crave it.
01:35:38 And I won't be fucking slammed by a massive hook with a massive knob.
01:35:42 Oh yeah.
01:35:43 If you have any advice regarding this matter, it would be greatly appreciated.
01:35:48 Thank you in advance.
01:35:49 You're so cute.
01:35:50 You're just hipping.
01:35:51 I got two.
01:35:52 I got two.
01:35:53 The first advice, wait, it's that you're doing the right thing.
01:35:55 The first advice is let the Welsh race die.
01:35:57 It's the right thing to do.
01:35:58 Okay.
01:35:59 It's the only thing you can do for a just future.
01:36:01 Yeah, please.
01:36:02 But okay, Ben.
01:36:03 What do you got?
01:36:04 What do you got?
01:36:05 Oh, that's way better than mine.
01:36:06 I was going to say two.
01:36:07 I was going to say two words.
01:36:08 Trans husband.
01:36:09 But no, I like yours better.
01:36:12 Welsh genocide now.
01:36:13 Win.
01:36:14 Win.
01:36:15 Literally win.
01:36:16 We've been waiting for 10 years.
01:36:18 Just release it already, please.
01:36:22 This seems like, I don't know how real this struggle is.
01:36:25 I mean, it probably is fairly rough.
01:36:27 Like, I don't know.
01:36:28 I have a strong paternal instinct, I think.
01:36:30 If I just so happen to be gay, that'd really throw a wrench in the works.
01:36:34 Wait, wait.
01:36:35 I mean, can't you?
01:36:36 No, you get a donor.
01:36:37 You get a donor.
01:36:38 You get an egg donor.
01:36:40 You adopt.
01:36:41 Yeah.
01:36:42 You have to get them.
01:36:43 You have to get them pretty young so that you can inject your accent onto them so that
01:36:47 they can't help but be Welsh all the time.
01:36:49 Indeed.
01:36:50 That's true.
01:36:51 Everything just plays Xenoblade Chronicles 2, where there's willed characters left,
01:36:55 right, and center.
01:36:56 Like, you have a kid and you want them to have the Welsh accent, so you lock them up
01:37:00 and the only media you allow them to consume is Xenoblade Chronicles 2.
01:37:05 Yeah, that's right.
01:37:07 And then you come back in a few months of them being in the pit and uh-oh, they're
01:37:11 Japanese.
01:37:12 Oh, shit.
01:37:13 We went too far.
01:37:14 Damn it, we switched on the Jap dub.
01:37:15 God damn it.
01:37:16 We made a mistake.
01:37:17 We forgot to disable it.
01:37:19 Yeah, we had to turn it off.
01:37:21 Yeah, another one bites the dust.
01:37:23 Well, uh-uh-uh, you know, I don't know, look into adoption, yeah, I'm sure there's, you
01:37:26 know, I don't know, there's fucking gay dudes out there, you've got big old families.
01:37:29 Just get ahead of me.
01:37:30 Just get ahead of me.
01:37:31 Be the best dad you can be.
01:37:32 Just get ahead of me.
01:37:33 The proud gay dad.
01:37:34 You know, we have two gay dads around here.
01:37:36 The proud, proud tradition of two gay dads.
01:37:38 Indeed, indeed.
01:37:40 One day.
01:37:41 One day.
01:37:42 Welcome back to best dad ever.
01:37:44 Who you are with.
01:37:45 Maybe I'll have another child monthly.
01:37:47 Well, we'll have you go with Barry's broods.
01:37:51 I mean, it's only utilitarian.
01:37:52 I have to have at least nine wives, I think, that's the math how it works out in order
01:37:56 to, you know, be keeping the train running at any one moment.
01:38:00 Maybe I'll actually make a fucking family.
01:38:03 Okay, let's move on.
01:38:05 We got a call from God.
01:38:07 God is calling in.
01:38:08 Oh, God, this asshole.
01:38:10 Tom's had some harsh words for him recently, but, you know, maybe, uh, some harsh words
01:38:15 right now.
01:38:16 Okay, let's see what he has to say.
01:38:18 Go.
01:38:19 Hello.
01:38:20 It is me, God.
01:38:24 My question to the DCD is, if you were to meet me, God, what would you ask me?
01:38:32 Yes.
01:38:33 God.
01:38:34 Can't you handle the reverb assholes?
01:38:36 God.
01:38:37 Turn down the reverb is the first thing I'd ask.
01:38:39 Is that, that's it?
01:38:40 That's it?
01:38:41 That's it?
01:38:42 I'd ask you from where you hail.
01:38:44 I'd ask for a fucking, I'd ask to fucking leave me alone, please.
01:38:51 Don't, don't, don't ever talk to me or my gate, my two gay sons ever again.
01:38:56 I'd say, I'd say put dispenser here and I'd point nine.
01:39:01 Tom, Tom, you've had some, some back and forth with God recently.
01:39:05 What would you say if he appeared before you?
01:39:08 Uh, fuck you, buddy.
01:39:11 Yeah.
01:39:12 I mean, okay.
01:39:13 I hate God.
01:39:14 What's the deal with this capitalism thing?
01:39:16 What's with all this inequality?
01:39:17 God damn it, God.
01:39:19 I'm about to ruin the next, the voice down for the next two months.
01:39:23 God, can you please put a wah-wah on your next, uh, your next recording, please?
01:39:27 Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:39:28 I take my answer back.
01:39:29 I take my answer back.
01:39:30 I have, I have the perfect thing to ask God.
01:39:32 Okay.
01:39:33 Where's the podcast?
01:39:35 Yes!
01:39:36 Oh my God, I couldn't, I had abandoned hope.
01:39:40 I had abandoned hope.
01:39:41 I didn't even think of it.
01:39:42 No.
01:39:43 That's true.
01:39:44 You're right.
01:39:45 You got to keep hope alive.
01:39:46 That's, that's the litmus test.
01:39:47 If he can't give you an answer, clearly not actually God.
01:39:48 That was right online.
01:39:49 Oh, that's so true.
01:39:50 Atheism for the win.
01:39:51 You got him coming and going, Tom.
01:39:52 That's finesse right there.
01:39:53 Uh, I would repeat the entire final cut scene of the Simpsons game for Xbox 360, the Simpsons
01:39:59 Finland confronts God.
01:40:00 And then I would challenge him to a DDR match and I would win using the Xbox 360's terrible
01:40:04 D-pad.
01:40:05 But I would still overcome any challenge in front of me.
01:40:10 And I would destroy the Prey station.
01:40:13 I would destroy it.
01:40:14 Oh yes.
01:40:15 Please do.
01:40:16 Please do.
01:40:17 Um, okay.
01:40:18 Let's move on.
01:40:19 Uh, the Japanese man, Yuta, uh, is calling it.
01:40:21 Let's, uh, let's hear you say, go.
01:40:22 Okay.
01:40:23 Okay.
01:40:24 So here's a D-D, a D-D bro impression.
01:40:27 Uh-huh.
01:40:28 So Japanese is in the middle of hell here.
01:40:33 Stop.
01:40:34 Stop this.
01:40:35 Stop.
01:40:36 Let's shut up fucking down, I hope.
01:40:41 Nate, Nate, we trust you to get things for quality and experience at the best quality.
01:40:50 There he goes.
01:40:51 All right.
01:40:52 Is that it?
01:40:53 Is this the first inductee into the voice jail as we were discussing before?
01:40:56 Get this guy on the teen CP.
01:40:57 Get this guy on the teen CP.
01:40:58 Get this guy on the teen CP.
01:40:59 Oh yeah.
01:41:00 We announced, we announced a new concept on the PCP.
01:41:02 You've heard of the Hall of Fame.
01:41:04 You've heard of the voice grail.
01:41:06 The Gary for the voice jail, for when you're a shitty voice girl that we fucking hate,
01:41:10 we're putting you in the voice jail.
01:41:11 And you Japanese man, you're going straight to the fucking voice jail.
01:41:17 If you get put in the voice jail, you have to double your patronage.
01:41:20 You have to.
01:41:21 That's how you get out.
01:41:23 It's the only way to get out.
01:41:24 You gotta buy your way out.
01:41:25 That's right.
01:41:26 The joke's on us because anyone in the voice jail is pledging nothing.
01:41:28 There's already a zero dollar patron, so doubling it is still zero.
01:41:31 Dammit.
01:41:32 Nah.
01:41:34 Plus 10.
01:41:35 That looks amazing.
01:41:38 We gotta define exactly how many PC pennies it takes to buy your way out.
01:41:43 You know what?
01:41:44 I mean, we can adjudicate on a case by case basis.
01:41:47 We can levy fines.
01:41:48 This guy's like a twenty dollar monthly.
01:41:51 We're clearly on a first name basis with God now, so we can offer indulgences to anybody
01:41:55 who's in the voice jail.
01:41:57 We can offer them an affordable payment plan to mortgage their way out of voice jail.
01:42:05 Okay.
01:42:06 All right.
01:42:07 Let's move along.
01:42:08 We've got one from hashtag where's the megafauna?
01:42:13 Let's find out.
01:42:14 Go.
01:42:15 I love megafaunas so much.
01:42:16 Hey, everybody.
01:42:17 Last week or so, y'all were talking about the domestication of the avocado, and I gotta
01:42:19 say I love that shit.
01:42:21 Let me tell you how it all went down.
01:42:23 You know how fruits and shit have seeds, and sometimes we swallow on an accident?
01:42:25 These were designed that way, so we could shit them out elsewhere and give them some
01:42:28 fertilizer.
01:42:29 Well, avocados were the same way.
01:42:31 Central America used to be home to all sorts of megafauna, like giant sloths and shit,
01:42:34 who could one-shot an avocado and crap out the pit.
01:42:36 But then they all went extinct because of climate change and rise of man and shit, and avocados
01:42:39 were like, fuck what now?
01:42:41 But then people showed up and were like, I like this, and started farming them, and
01:42:43 that's like the only reason avocados are still around today.
01:42:46 Natural history gets me rock hard.
01:42:49 Hell yeah.
01:42:50 Hell yeah.
01:42:51 Were we talking about the domestication of the avocado?
01:42:53 I don't remember what we were saying about it.
01:42:55 I have no recollection of anything before.
01:42:59 It was the most important day of your life.
01:43:00 To us, it was Sunday.
01:43:02 Yeah.
01:43:03 Oh, it's so true.
01:43:07 It's harsh but fair.
01:43:08 By the way.
01:43:09 I love hearing stories about things that should not be, but humans have prolonged its extinction
01:43:15 just for our own benefit.
01:43:18 There are so many instances of plants or animals, or just things that we have just kept in the
01:43:25 world to make ourselves happy.
01:43:28 I bet that a natural avocado doesn't look anything like the thing we buy at a supermarket.
01:43:33 You ever seen wild bananas?
01:43:34 Yes.
01:43:35 Like what bananas used to look for, like before we fucking...
01:43:38 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:43:39 No, no, no, no.
01:43:40 There are some crazy bananas that are like spheres.
01:43:43 They're like all seed, and they look fucking nasty.
01:43:47 Did I want a sphere banana?
01:43:49 How would you pull that?
01:43:50 You don't.
01:43:51 You don't.
01:43:52 Fuck it.
01:43:53 Here, let me find a picture.
01:43:54 I don't want to eat it.
01:43:55 I know exactly what you're talking about, and they look like fuck.
01:43:57 They're from Papua New Guinea.
01:43:59 Yeah, oh god.
01:44:02 They're really gross.
01:44:03 They're really, really gross.
01:44:04 Copy image, post in this in the...
01:44:07 I had heard this somewhere, and I don't know if it's true, but the reason that banana-flavored
01:44:12 candy doesn't taste like bananas, because it's a different kind of banana that doesn't
01:44:15 exist anymore when they made the flavor, is that real?
01:44:18 Yeah, yeah, there was another strain.
01:44:20 This is bizarre.
01:44:21 I know what you're talking about.
01:44:22 This is always...
01:44:23 Dude, okay, okay.
01:44:25 Apples used to taste like raw potatoes when you ate them, but they used to bread them.
01:44:32 We bread them to be how apples are now.
01:44:35 That's fucked up, man.
01:44:36 But also gross.
01:44:37 That's not fucked up.
01:44:38 That's delicious.
01:44:39 Yeah.
01:44:40 True.
01:44:41 Hey, also, I've taken the liberty of...
01:44:42 I just made a document.
01:44:43 Oh, Cavendish.
01:44:44 Wait, no.
01:44:45 Cavendish banana was...
01:44:46 Yeah.
01:44:47 Well, I don't remember if Cavendish is the kind that survived or the kind that died out.
01:44:49 No, no, no.
01:44:50 Okay, okay, okay.
01:44:51 So, Cavendish is right now.
01:44:52 Yeah.
01:44:53 Cavendish are modern-day bananas.
01:44:54 Before modern-day bananas, it wasn't like...
01:44:55 Was it Gross Michael?
01:44:56 Yeah, exactly.
01:44:57 Gross Michael.
01:44:58 It didn't go from what you just posted, Ben, to our modern-day banana.
01:45:01 There's been various iterations.
01:45:02 And Gross Michael, fun fact, which I learned from my favorite YouTube channel, Laffy Pursuits.
01:45:07 So when you taste banana candy, right?
01:45:09 And you think, okay, I'm ready to taste some banana, but it doesn't really taste like
01:45:12 banana, like modern banana.
01:45:14 It has a very...
01:45:15 It has a different taste.
01:45:16 And you may think to yourself, that's just because, you know, it's artificial flavoring.
01:45:18 It's different candy.
01:45:19 No.
01:45:20 Wrong.
01:45:21 Wrong.
01:45:22 You are actually tasting the past, because the banana candy flavoring that everyone
01:45:26 uses is based off the Gross Michael, the past iteration of bananas, and it was flavored
01:45:32 to be like the Gross Michael instead of our modern Cavendish's.
01:45:35 How crazy is that shit?
01:45:37 Fuck you, bananas.
01:45:39 Why don't they update it?
01:45:40 Whoa.
01:45:41 Because that's what everyone is used to having candy taste like, you know?
01:45:43 It would be like, oh, why is banana case different now?
01:45:45 Is there any way to get the old banana back?
01:45:48 I want to try it.
01:45:49 Yes.
01:45:50 But there are a few, you know, they are not widely distributed because of a disease that
01:45:56 ripped through and destroyed like a lot of the banana population a while ago.
01:45:59 So now, Gross Michael is like an oddity and a rarity.
01:46:03 Banana Hitler didn't fuck around.
01:46:04 No.
01:46:05 I just made a document that's going to be in the show notes, people.
01:46:08 It's the official PCP Hall of Fame slash shame slash voice jail, whatever.
01:46:13 It got them snakes riddle my ass Batman, grail, sure, whatever.
01:46:19 In the Hall of Shame, we've got the Japanese man, Yuda, and I'm sure there's others I'm
01:46:22 forgetting.
01:46:23 I'm sure there's got to be more.
01:46:25 Okay.
01:46:26 They didn't know they were committing a crime now.
01:46:28 You guys know now that there will be repercussions.
01:46:31 There will be repercussions.
01:46:32 Yes.
01:46:33 Okay.
01:46:34 They've been made aware.
01:46:35 Well, I don't know.
01:46:36 This is really repercussions if we're going to be remembering them.
01:46:37 Hey, what about one?
01:46:38 Remember?
01:46:39 Well, no.
01:46:40 I don't want to comment.
01:46:41 Talk about how terrible Yuda is.
01:46:42 Talk about how he's a nightmare.
01:46:43 Doc's Yuda.
01:46:44 Everybody docs Yuda in chat right now.
01:46:46 Okay.
01:46:47 I think OneSpar should be on the Hall of Fame.
01:46:48 I agree.
01:46:49 He had a saga.
01:46:50 Remember the OneSpar saga?
01:46:51 Yeah.
01:46:52 OneSpar Weekly.
01:46:53 Fagely.
01:46:54 Oh, yeah.
01:46:55 He briefly became Wolfspar.
01:46:56 Oh, okay.
01:46:57 You know what?
01:46:58 I do remember that now.
01:46:59 Yeah, fuck it.
01:47:00 All right.
01:47:01 He's in.
01:47:02 Okay, but no more reaction.
01:47:03 You have to be current.
01:47:04 You've got to be up-to-date next time.
01:47:05 Yeah, okay.
01:47:06 That's fair.
01:47:07 That's fair.
01:47:08 Okay.
01:47:09 All right.
01:47:10 But let's move along here, people.
01:47:11 We've got lots to get through.
01:47:12 Next one, we've got a voicemail from the humble John.
01:47:13 Okay, let's see what John has for us.
01:47:15 Big Bird?
01:47:16 A one.
01:47:17 Malina.
01:47:18 Two.
01:47:19 A one.
01:47:20 Two.
01:47:21 Three.
01:47:22 This one's for Nate.
01:47:23 You've said an expectation long ago, expressing your hate.
01:47:30 I can relate.
01:47:31 And I've been looking forward to this thing you mentioned on a podcast.
01:47:35 You did with Diggy Bro.
01:47:36 Yeah.
01:47:37 About a terrible show.
01:47:38 But the one I want to hear from you.
01:47:42 One is the one that has this song.
01:47:49 Yeah.
01:47:50 So when are you going to make a video that destroys your favorite little sister show?
01:47:57 They say be the change that you want to see, but you really don't want to hear from me.
01:48:04 That was so good.
01:48:26 That was so good.
01:48:27 That was incredible.
01:48:28 I think that's the Auremo theme song.
01:48:30 I was going to say that's got to be the Auremo.
01:48:32 It's got to be.
01:48:33 Holy shit.
01:48:34 That was so...
01:48:35 Is that a voice grail right off the bat?
01:48:37 I think that he does that.
01:48:38 That's a voice grail.
01:48:39 That's a voice grail.
01:48:40 That is for sure a voice grail.
01:48:41 That is for sure a voice grail.
01:48:42 I'm going to put John Auremo.
01:48:43 I'm going to put John Auremo.
01:48:44 John Auremo.
01:48:45 That's his name.
01:48:46 Well, you've got to do it now.
01:48:49 You've got to do it now, Nate.
01:48:51 You know what?
01:48:52 You spelled it wrong.
01:48:53 The I goes before the M.
01:48:54 Or a emo.
01:48:55 Or a emo.
01:48:56 Or a emo.
01:48:57 Or a emo.
01:48:58 Man, I fucking hate that show.
01:48:59 As you should, man.
01:49:00 As you should.
01:49:01 You know, there actually happened to be another voicemail about this as well, asking me about
01:49:05 it.
01:49:06 And so, people, I just want to remind everyone, you know, maybe I didn't say this with enough
01:49:10 force before.
01:49:11 I'm going full-time YouTubing, ladies and gentlemen, and what do you think I'm doing
01:49:16 that for?
01:49:17 What do you think I'm trying to do, but finally get this bugbear off my back?
01:49:20 It's all about that Auremo, baby.
01:49:23 So that's not my first project, but as everyone knows, it's in the works.
01:49:26 So you will be seeing a lot more of best anime ever's from me in the future.
01:49:33 So get ready to slurp them down deliciously.
01:49:36 Everyone or emo, best anime ever, as everyone knows.
01:49:38 So we'll, I'm excited to see more of that.
01:49:41 One Spark, you could add some backing instrumental to that.
01:49:44 If you can do that, buddy.
01:49:45 That'd be great.
01:49:46 Just see what you can do.
01:49:47 See what you can do.
01:49:48 Oblivionfall, you mean?
01:49:49 Oblivionfall, you mean?
01:49:50 Oblivionfall, what did I say?
01:49:51 You said One Spark.
01:49:52 You said One Spark.
01:49:53 One Spark.
01:49:54 Congratulations.
01:49:55 Congratulations, dude.
01:49:56 Yeah, sorry about Oblivion.
01:49:58 Okay.
01:49:59 Moving on.
01:50:00 That was so good.
01:50:01 He clearly wrote out lyrics.
01:50:02 It was fantastic.
01:50:03 That was really nice.
01:50:04 That was a really nice job with the lyrics there.
01:50:07 Oh my God.
01:50:08 That was so sick.
01:50:09 Okay.
01:50:10 Parody songs are like sort of a difficult art where if you make them lame, they can
01:50:15 just be really, really stupid.
01:50:16 Absolutely.
01:50:17 If you don't make the lyrics fit, if you don't make the lyrics funny and fit the tone of
01:50:22 the song or the syllables, then you've made a shit product.
01:50:25 For sure.
01:50:26 We hate you.
01:50:27 But if you make them good, oh.
01:50:28 If you're doing a cover and you fall even a little short of nailing it with the lyrics,
01:50:32 you just eat shit way harder, you know what I mean?
01:50:35 I can say to this kind of my area of expertise is I've written quite a few of these over
01:50:38 the years and hope to do more in the coming months and years, a lot.
01:50:44 It's a very fine balance.
01:50:46 I don't know.
01:50:47 I do this a lot in my content in general.
01:50:49 Maybe it stems from this.
01:50:50 I did this first, I don't know, whatever.
01:50:53 When you're doing a parody, you can't be too overly sincere and overly saccharine about
01:51:00 it.
01:51:01 You've got to have a playful element to it.
01:51:02 Then you've got to earn your sincerity if you're going to hit some at the end.
01:51:06 I would say that the artistry of a parody song is in how you re-cajigger the lyrics.
01:51:13 You've got to make the way you do that funny and clever and sound great.
01:51:18 Remember?
01:51:19 Remember the opening of keg reviews or the song at the end, blah blah blah.
01:51:24 Let me see.
01:51:26 I fear I told the little Fib about my being cool but now I'm 8 on the line so don't think
01:51:33 I'm a fool.
01:51:34 I wasn't quite the super alpha pony like I claim.
01:51:37 The fact is that I was a nerd who everyone called gay.
01:51:44 Now see, that's a classic line.
01:51:48 Everybody love that.
01:51:49 Is this R.A.E.M.O? I posted the thing.
01:51:52 Oh, let me see.
01:51:53 I saw this.
01:51:54 Yeah.
01:51:55 Yeah.
01:51:56 That's her.
01:51:57 The people know.
01:51:58 That's her.
01:51:59 Okay.
01:52:00 First of all, no.
01:52:01 That's Umaru-chan.
01:52:02 My little Umaru-chan.
01:52:03 Oh, okay.
01:52:04 Yeah.
01:52:05 Possibly.
01:52:06 Possibly.
01:52:07 Hey, I don't know.
01:52:08 They call Orange-chan.
01:52:09 This is a similar little system.
01:52:10 I hate Umaru.
01:52:11 Oh, maybe even more.
01:52:12 I don't know.
01:52:13 As a person, Umaru is a significantly worse person than Kirino.
01:52:16 Oh.
01:52:17 I hate the program.
01:52:18 I mean, I hate them both, too.
01:52:19 I hate the entire endeavor.
01:52:20 Yes.
01:52:21 It's bankrupt.
01:52:22 By the way, shout out to atstingercropes on Twitter who drew this funny picture that
01:52:28 you should be looking at.
01:52:29 A little link in the description.
01:52:30 They're cool.
01:52:31 I like them.
01:52:32 It's got missed opportunity.
01:52:33 It should say doomaru.
01:52:34 You know, that's true.
01:52:36 Because it's doom, right?
01:52:37 Alas, get a better luck next time.
01:52:40 That's it for your life.
01:52:41 Better luck on the next Wheel of Reincarnation turn, my dude.
01:52:44 Okay.
01:52:45 Doctor Wolf II has left us a message, ladies and gentlemen.
01:52:48 Oh my God, five on one.
01:52:50 One was enough.
01:52:51 Okay.
01:52:52 I hope we see him at BaronyCon.
01:52:53 I hope to God.
01:52:54 Oh, he'll be there.
01:52:55 But let's hear what he has to say.
01:52:56 You know, be there.
01:52:57 Well, this is his big brother, Doctor Wolf II.
01:52:59 Okay, let's go.
01:53:00 Oh, it'll be Doctor Wolf I.
01:53:02 Two episodes from when yesterday's playing.
01:53:05 Another listener called in about a situation I'd like to coin in no offensive way as light
01:53:10 cooking.
01:53:11 Oh, yes.
01:53:12 I mean, with everything y'all had to say, just about not being personally comfortable
01:53:17 with a situation like that, but I'd like to get specific with my question.
01:53:21 Let's say one of us, one of us is dating a model.
01:53:25 It's in the realm of possibilities, so hear me out, humor me.
01:53:30 Try to imagine that world where that's happening.
01:53:34 How would that person cope with his girl receiving unsolicited messages that contain
01:53:39 explicit materials on the reg?
01:53:42 Thanks.
01:53:43 So he's talking about me, obviously.
01:53:47 My girlfriend is a model.
01:53:49 That's pretty simple.
01:53:50 Yeah.
01:53:51 I mean, it's nothing to do, you know, they're unsolicited, what are you going to do about
01:53:56 it?
01:53:57 Indeed.
01:53:58 What's to say?
01:53:59 This is almost, so you know what, I actually, I did kind of want to respond, because frankly,
01:54:03 I was thinking to myself that, I mean, I forget what we were talking about, like dating
01:54:06 a porn star, dating like a, there was a voicemail about like companionship.
01:54:13 Was this the same guy who was on the, God, what was that website called?
01:54:17 Oh, Seeking Arrangements, I think?
01:54:19 Seeking?
01:54:20 Yes.
01:54:21 Yes.
01:54:22 Yes.
01:54:23 Yes.
01:54:24 This is not the same.
01:54:25 This is way less of an interesting question, honestly.
01:54:26 It is.
01:54:27 There's nothing to discuss here.
01:54:28 I mean, I thought it was, you know what, I'll say this though, okay, like on the spectrum
01:54:32 of cuckolding, because that's really what we're talking about, and like, so this is a
01:54:36 wide spectrum.
01:54:37 And okay, like, I'll just say that frankly, the people who are like, involved with a woman
01:54:42 who are being the least cucked, I'm not endorsing this, but I'm just saying that I think the
01:54:46 truth is that it's basically like, like those like Islamic extremist people who like, force
01:54:52 their women to cover themselves head to toe, so that no other man can see their woman.
01:54:56 I think those are the least cucked men on the planet, because you know, they're obviously
01:55:00 going over the top, and they're-
01:55:02 No, that has nothing, no.
01:55:05 That's dumb.
01:55:06 Well, let me finish my point.
01:55:09 Okay.
01:55:10 Well, I object to your premise here, because that is something that the man is doing.
01:55:15 Whether you're being cucked is not up to you, it is up to your partner, you know what I
01:55:20 mean?
01:55:21 I mean, I mean-
01:55:22 It's entirely about their decisions.
01:55:23 Theoretically, one way to avoid getting cucked is to like, you know, you could like, intimidate
01:55:28 or imprison your significant other.
01:55:30 I mean, in an amoral sense, one could do that.
01:55:34 Yeah.
01:55:35 But I mean-
01:55:36 But that doesn't make them any less cucked than a man who doesn't do that, and whose
01:55:41 woman isn't cucking him.
01:55:43 I think if you're the sort of person who has to imprison people in order to make sure
01:55:48 that nobody steals them away, or that they don't leave, then you are the biggest cuck
01:55:51 of all, because you can't hold onto them with your own like, qualities.
01:55:55 Well, I mean, I mean, in a sense, that's true.
01:55:59 I think-
01:56:00 I feel like that's so far down like the ridiculous angle that it's like, I don't know, what
01:56:06 does he mean?
01:56:07 I mean, I'm trying to get to the root of his point here, but like, I just re- I think
01:56:11 that nothing, nothing you do can make you any less cucked.
01:56:17 If you're cucked, you're cucked, and if you're not, you're not.
01:56:20 Well, I don't know if I agree with that, because like-
01:56:22 Well, I mean, I think like the inaction of like letting it happen and not like putting
01:56:27 your foot down.
01:56:28 If you're just like a shitty BF, and your girlfriend is like, fuck him, I'm gonna fuck
01:56:31 Chad, then I mean, you know, you're involved in the process somewhat.
01:56:35 Well, okay, then you've been cucked, but then it is, it is your, you know, then the question
01:56:40 is, well, how do I respond to this?
01:56:42 And the answer is with a fucking atom bomb, you got to turn that key, you got to put that
01:56:48 key in the lock and hit that big red button.
01:56:52 I mean, I'll follow my example, though, to the extreme.
01:56:54 So first of all, on the whole like receiving unsolicited dick pics and whatnot, like there's
01:56:59 no control.
01:57:00 I mean, obviously that's, there's nothing she could do.
01:57:03 And I mean, you could say-
01:57:04 That's something, that's probably something that most girls-
01:57:06 I was going to say, to once again put on my, well, to just go full feminist as I do every
01:57:11 moment of my waking life, the, you know, women just have to deal with that in general.
01:57:17 And like, what's the solution?
01:57:19 Stop being an attractive woman who's on social media, is that the proposal?
01:57:24 So again, I'm not trying to moralize, I'm just saying-
01:57:25 I like this completely, like modest, like normal opinions are going full feminist, guys.
01:57:31 Like deep down the rabbit hole.
01:57:34 You know, maybe-
01:57:35 Well, I did just endorse to Sharia Law, so, you know-
01:57:37 There's some disbandages, maybe there are some, no, full feminist, full feminist, full
01:57:41 feminist.
01:57:42 But my only point is, okay, you know what, maybe, I will say it, I think that as a man
01:57:49 who has a girlfriend who does, in fact, produce and distribute images of her looking, you
01:57:55 know, relatively sexy, she's a sexy girl, obviously, but you know, in bathing suits
01:57:59 and whatnot, do I think that that's slightly more on the cuckolding spectrum than someone
01:58:04 whose girlfriend does not do that?
01:58:06 Yes, yes I do, but that being said, like, let's not, you know, obviously this is a very
01:58:12 slight degree, this is a very modest amount here.
01:58:15 Alright, everyone start writing your think pieces titled, Nate Bestman admits to being
01:58:22 cucked.
01:58:23 To be cucked.
01:58:24 I don't know, honestly I feel bad even saying it, obviously it's not actually the case,
01:58:28 but I just gotta be honest, gotta be intellectually consistent here, and one who has like a modest
01:58:34 at home wife who just like wears her big Victorian dresses that cover her 102%.
01:58:40 Her hoop skirts.
01:58:41 Yep, yep, and you know, dressed super modestly and all that.
01:58:44 It just, it strikes me as funny to like come at it from a very intellectually like consistent
01:58:51 perspective when this is very much an emotional thing.
01:58:55 I mean, that depends on what she's writing to.
01:58:58 What does it matter, what does it matter one way or the other whether you are technically
01:59:00 cucked like a certain percent or not?
01:59:02 I mean, I'm approaching it more in the technical sense than the emotional one, because I do
01:59:05 not feel cucked, but like technically analyzing it, I think that there is, you know.
01:59:11 Why would you even go to the effort of making sure that you are being honest with that when
01:59:15 it, you don't feel it?
01:59:17 Well, I just try to be intellectually consistent, and like maybe I'm wrong, but like this is
01:59:21 just my thought process on the subject.
01:59:22 Like, like, how do you know people like add up the numbers the same way you do?
01:59:27 I don't.
01:59:28 Here's my, here's my counter example.
01:59:30 Okay.
01:59:31 Say you got a couple that are in an open relationship and one of them fucks another person, that's
01:59:36 not cucking.
01:59:37 But again, unlike my technical analysis here, the whole relationship is kind of dual way
01:59:42 cucking.
01:59:43 Dual way cucking?
01:59:44 No.
01:59:45 That doesn't make sense.
01:59:46 No.
01:59:47 That doesn't make sense.
01:59:48 No.
01:59:49 You know, my worldview about this cucking spectrum is actually pretty flawed.
01:59:51 I'm noticing.
01:59:52 So, you know.
01:59:53 It's a little, it's a little weird.
01:59:54 It's maybe.
01:59:55 Backpedal.
01:59:56 Maybe there's some mistakes here.
01:59:57 Undig that hole.
01:59:58 Undig that hole quick.
01:59:59 It invites certain lines of inquiry.
02:00:00 Cucking is such a vague thing that everyone means it in a different way, and it's hard
02:00:05 to actually have a conversation about it because no one actually, you could mean actual cucking
02:00:10 as a real thing that exists that has a proper name, cucking, you know what I'm saying about?
02:00:16 Like more far removed, like the general sense of just cheating, if you just make it like
02:00:22 a personality trait where dude, that guy is such a cuck.
02:00:25 Fuck that guy.
02:00:26 But people do use it that way now.
02:00:27 So, it's hard to say that that's totally wrong, I guess.
02:00:29 Well, I'm not saying that it is wrong.
02:00:31 I'm just saying it's another definition that they're just playing out.
02:00:34 That's a figurative cuck without being a literal cuck.
02:00:37 I guess that's true.
02:00:38 I was watching Joe Rogan the other day, and he had like a debate with the Adam Ruins Everything
02:00:43 guy, and basically this was a discussion on like whether-
02:00:45 Ah, yes, Adam.
02:00:46 Well, Adam, I can't remember his name.
02:00:48 Adam Conover.
02:00:49 Yeah, I don't know his last name, but I know-
02:00:50 He, um-
02:00:51 It's Adam Conover.
02:00:52 I confused him with Alton Brown all the time.
02:00:55 Oh, yeah.
02:00:56 Let's kill yourself.
02:00:57 Well, okay.
02:00:58 Only Alton Brown likes you.
02:00:59 They had a debate about whether or not alphas and betas like exist in human beings.
02:01:05 And basically, I mean, it immediately seemed like Adam was using the like, like the biological,
02:01:12 like inherent like wolves, like they have alphas and betas, like, you know, like a naturalistic
02:01:17 sort of setup.
02:01:18 And he's like, no, no, no, that doesn't exist in humans.
02:01:20 Like we don't operate on that level.
02:01:22 We're like far more complex.
02:01:24 I have something to say about this.
02:01:25 My only point is just that like Joe Rogan, like he was definitely saying like, no, no,
02:01:29 like alphas and betas, like you got like a strong alpha dude and you got like a little,
02:01:32 you know, intimate, timid guy, like that alpha beta dynamic is right there.
02:01:36 But like, obviously he's just using kind of a different definition from what Adam's
02:01:40 using.
02:01:41 So like-
02:01:42 Yeah, if you define alpha and beta to mean confident guy versus shy guy, then yeah, obviously
02:01:47 they exist.
02:01:48 So, um, think about, think about alphas.
02:01:50 Did you know that that like wolf research was discredited and like that alpha, that
02:01:56 actually doesn't exist in like wolf packs in nature?
02:01:59 Okay.
02:02:00 Don't like gorillas have it too though or something?
02:02:02 Well, they have a, they do have a, I think they have like a, fuck, they have the-
02:02:07 A big leader guy?
02:02:08 Is it called the alpha?
02:02:09 I think so.
02:02:10 I think there's, I don't know if it's the alpha or if it's not, yeah, yeah, I think
02:02:13 like a gorilla has a, has something like that.
02:02:16 But like that, that research where the word came out of that like this happens in wolves,
02:02:21 like that same researcher did more research that like invalidated his old hypothesis was
02:02:25 like, yeah, all that stuff I said about alpha wolves doesn't happen.
02:02:28 Just to be clear, I mean, what did he claim?
02:02:30 Like there was like one dominant leader that would like get all the girls basically and
02:02:34 that-
02:02:35 It's something like that.
02:02:36 Okay.
02:02:37 Yeah.
02:02:38 I mean, I've, I feel like wolves, they're very much more of a collaborative group effort
02:02:41 sort of thing.
02:02:42 I mean, I mean, all groups of animals that, you know, successful, they group together,
02:02:47 but like-
02:02:48 Even us.
02:02:49 I've seen nature documentaries and it seems like they just work as like a team rather
02:02:52 than one guy is big and the others are small.
02:02:56 Um, yeah.
02:02:57 Though, I mean, I mean, they're like, it's not, you know, not every naturalistic system
02:03:01 is like, you know, even or whatever.
02:03:03 So there's like, there's only so many like females to breed with or whatever.
02:03:06 So it would make sense for there to be some-
02:03:08 I mean, yeah, there's always the ones, there's the ones that are the most good for the thing.
02:03:13 Like, I think alpha and beta, it means something a little different than just, uh, I'm talking
02:03:19 out of my butt.
02:03:21 I mean, even, even from the beginning, like as soon as people started using that like
02:03:25 alpha dog, like wolf research and like mapping it onto humans, we were already like being
02:03:30 figurative.
02:03:31 Yeah.
02:03:32 I mean, that's true.
02:03:33 Like, do I believe that there are confident and less confident humans and that this impacts
02:03:36 their like social graces and skill and achievement?
02:03:38 I mean, yeah, but you know, if that's not what it biologically means that they, fair enough.
02:03:42 By the way, are you guys aware of how hyenas are like structured socially, especially
02:03:46 like men and women?
02:03:47 Yes.
02:03:48 It's fucked up.
02:03:49 The men are repressed.
02:03:50 Those poor repressed gamer hyenas need to rise up and overthrow the cruel matriarchy because
02:03:55 the women are bigger and stronger and bully them and it's mean and I don't like it.
02:03:59 Male hyenas are fucked.
02:04:01 Dude, have you heard of spiders?
02:04:02 Uh, a little bit.
02:04:04 Is it just that-
02:04:05 Male spiders are tiny and the females kill them and eat them after they impregnate, are
02:04:09 impregnated by them.
02:04:10 That's fucked up.
02:04:11 Oh, wait, so, so the just like female hyenas are the bigger like more dominant ones?
02:04:15 Yeah, they're bigger, stronger and dominate like the whole social hierarchy.
02:04:19 I mean, really, what is it like?
02:04:21 There's nothing inherently like more-
02:04:23 Guys, we gotta stop all these trans male hyenas from competing in the male hyena arena.
02:04:30 In the hyena arena.
02:04:31 It's not fair to those poor, you know, natural-
02:04:34 I'm a turf for hyenas for sure, coming down a hard stance.
02:04:38 We gotta have the male hyena leagues.
02:04:40 Hyena.
02:04:41 They can't compete.
02:04:42 I'm a trans exclusionary radical hyenaist.
02:04:45 A turf.
02:04:46 A turf.
02:04:47 A turf.
02:04:48 Lion King 4 hyena arena.
02:04:50 Guys, you aren't using the right term.
02:04:53 Yeah.
02:04:54 We all know that saying hyena is just so 1990s, we have our new term.
02:05:01 The phrase that comes up with it.
02:05:02 You gotta say yin.
02:05:04 Guys, I just love being a yin.
02:05:09 Is this the furry equivalent?
02:05:10 Is this like how they slang?
02:05:11 Or is this just like the new, is this what zoomers call hyenas?
02:05:16 This is slang for hyena.
02:05:17 This is slang for hyena.
02:05:18 Yo.
02:05:19 You guys just love saying yin.
02:05:20 Yo, me and my boys, we're chillin' in the safari.
02:05:21 Say it right now.
02:05:22 Say it.
02:05:23 Say it.
02:05:24 Say it.
02:05:25 Say it.
02:05:26 Say it.
02:05:27 Say it.
02:05:28 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yin.
02:05:29 I'm yinin.
02:05:30 I'm a big fan.
02:05:31 So, like, so when you're on Twitter and you're retweeting your cute hyena pics and you're
02:05:32 like, oh, look at that yin.
02:05:33 Like, like, yin is to hyena as doggo is to dog.
02:05:36 Exactly.
02:05:37 I hate doggo.
02:05:38 Doggy is better than doggo.
02:05:39 Well, doggo is like the Reddit version.
02:05:41 Well, yin tops it all.
02:05:43 Doggo is like the mage version, which is good in some situations, but not all.
02:05:47 All right.
02:05:48 I'm thoroughly enamored with hyena arena.
02:05:50 Yeah, hyena arena.
02:05:51 Like hyena arena, hyena arena, hyena arena, hyena arena, or yin arena, yin arena for short.
02:05:59 Yeah, we gotta save time, because we're gonna be saying these words a lot.
02:06:03 In the jungle, the mighty savannah, the lion is a hyena.
02:06:06 All right.
02:06:07 Let's move on.
02:06:08 Let's move on.
02:06:09 Please.
02:06:10 Yeah.
02:06:11 Okay.
02:06:12 We've got Hell No Fresh is calling in with Hell No Fresh Freestyle World Star Exclusive.

02:06:26 I see how it is.
02:06:27 I think you're a big, strong man, big, tough guy talking shit about instant ramen, huh?
02:06:31 Yeah.
02:06:32 All right, dog.
02:06:33 I'll remember that.
02:06:34 Yeah.
02:06:35 See how tough you are in a minute.
02:06:36 Throw a shade at my ramen recipe.
02:06:38 I'll put it simply in soliloquy.
02:06:41 You can rest in peace.
02:06:42 Fuck a tutorial.
02:06:43 I'm cooking up bars now.
02:06:44 I'll shoot you into space like Joseph did the cars now, because you're the type of
02:06:48 nigga that fuck with hearted bitches.
02:06:50 It's all engagement till the social workers get you.
02:06:53 Get the picture.
02:06:54 I'm no longer fucking with you.
02:06:55 Thought you could get away with shit and all my dishes, did you?
02:06:58 Spit bars quick, instant ramen in the booth.
02:07:00 How about you make like Sekiro a bunch of suicide tooth?
02:07:03 I rhyme for my bootleg food.
02:07:04 It's Hell No Fresh.
02:07:05 Easy to follow recipes, John Favreau flex.
02:07:08 You're dead.
02:07:09 Now, I'm the best guy ever.
02:07:10 You're just a ghost in the shell.
02:07:11 Oh, well.
02:07:12 Good luck in development.
02:07:13 Hell, kid.
02:07:14 Yo, shout some munchin'.
02:07:16 The carbonara was fire.
02:07:18 I think we're done here.
02:07:20 Peace.
02:07:21 Yes!
02:07:22 My two favorite things.
02:07:24 Hating Nate and loving myself.
02:07:31 Wow.
02:07:32 It's so cool.
02:07:33 That's lame.
02:07:34 Okay.
02:07:35 Combination.
02:07:36 Please allow me to have the floor, because this requires a lot of information.
02:07:39 So to start this out with, I would say this, this beautiful song, you know, obviously anti-night
02:07:45 which we can all get behind, you know, the working class and his past recipe on the last
02:07:50 episode.
02:07:51 Holy grail.
02:07:52 Holy grail.
02:07:53 However, however, Hell No Fresh, I've got something to say that I've got some follow-up
02:07:59 for you.
02:08:00 So last episode, if you all recall, Hell No Fresh called in with a recipe for peanut butter
02:08:07 instant ramen.
02:08:08 So it was, you would make some top ramen, mix in some sesame oil, some red pepper flakes
02:08:11 and some scallions and put some instant top ramen and get that chicken flavoring and
02:08:15 the peanut butter.
02:08:16 It would be delicious.
02:08:17 Now, immediately upon hearing this, I thought to myself, sounds delicious, sign me the
02:08:22 fuck up.
02:08:23 But those of you who know, my kitchen was not working.
02:08:26 So I had to wait a few days.
02:08:27 And then the day that my kitchen became available to you, which has happened, everyone, that
02:08:33 soggy is over.
02:08:34 And I had to look.
02:08:35 Hooray.
02:08:36 Ready and willing, prepared to make this top ramen.
02:08:40 The kitchen arc begins.
02:08:41 Yeah.
02:08:42 The kitchen arc ends.
02:08:43 So I, this was going to be the first dish that I made in my new kitchen.
02:08:46 Hell No Fresh, you had the honor of being the inaugurable person that would make the
02:08:52 recipe for this brand new spanking kitchen that I had in my disposal.
02:08:56 So I got all my greens.
02:08:57 I got the scallions.
02:08:58 I got the peanut butter.
02:08:59 I got the red pepper flakes.
02:09:00 I got the spicy sesame oil.
02:09:01 I got the top ramen.
02:09:02 I got everything.
02:09:03 And I was ready to go full in all chips on the table.
02:09:08 And so I got all my greens.
02:09:09 I was chopping up the scallions.
02:09:10 And so I thought to myself, wait a second, wait a second, hold on.
02:09:13 This is, in occasion, this is a special event.
02:09:17 You know what I had to do that I've been putting off for a while and since I haven't had a kitchen
02:09:20 and I haven't been able to use it, I required, I acquired a chef grade knife from my girlfriend's
02:09:27 father.
02:09:28 He gave it to me because he took note of my cooking and so he gave me a really high quality
02:09:31 sharp ass knife.
02:09:32 Was this boards of like adamantium or something?
02:09:35 What's the, yeah.
02:09:36 Okay.
02:09:37 It's ultra sharp.
02:09:38 And so I, you know, I'm going to use it for the first time on this.
02:09:40 Hell no fresh.
02:09:41 Listen, buddy, me and you were bonded.
02:09:44 We're so linked.
02:09:45 We're going to bet to J.O.
02:09:46 And I'm at three seconds.
02:09:47 Artquist crystals sink.
02:09:48 Nice.
02:09:49 And so I got down my chef knife and just, I want to point picture.
02:09:52 I was so excited.
02:09:53 Right.
02:09:54 I was so eager.
02:09:55 I was so just ready to live the cooking lifestyle again, to be the chef that I was always meant
02:10:00 to be.
02:10:01 I had this professional grade knife.
02:10:02 I had this recipe that I was so just interested in and I was so happy.
02:10:08 I put my fingers a little bit too close to the blade.
02:10:11 I didn't practice proper blade safety.
02:10:14 I did not curl my fingers the way they're supposed to.
02:10:16 I did not make the block so that my, the, the, the, the, uh, the braid would hit up against
02:10:21 my, my midfingers and you know, knock on my finger.
02:10:24 So I chopped down while I'm making the scallions.
02:10:26 Oh God.
02:10:27 Wow.
02:10:28 What?
02:10:29 Yeah.
02:10:30 A slice of my fingers are gone and I'm not saying like, I'm saying a slice of my fingers
02:10:36 are gone.
02:10:37 And if you look at my fingers now, literally there is a deformation on my fingers.
02:10:42 Even now there is like a slice of it visibly off nine.
02:10:46 My hair now lopsided forever.
02:10:48 My, my, my left middle just forever deformed because of chefs in general and specifically
02:10:55 you hell no thresh, but I will say, and because of that, I'm putting you in the hell and in
02:11:00 the voice jail because of you cause, but wait, but wait, but wait, but wait, what's this?
02:11:06 What's this?
02:11:07 I've cut my finger and I'm really pissed off and it's bleeding everywhere and I have
02:11:10 to go to the emergency room and I have to pay $75 for them to just give me antibiotic
02:11:13 cream.
02:11:14 I'm receiving the, I'm receiving, but with rage, but, but I can't let these scallions
02:11:21 go to waste.
02:11:22 What, what am I going to do?
02:11:23 And so I had the bandages on the next day.
02:11:26 I, I'm, I'm in pain.
02:11:28 It's bleeding profusely, but you know what I do?
02:11:30 You know what I do?
02:11:32 I have to finish the fight.
02:11:33 I have to, I, I, I, I just have to in the weird, weird L's words, just eat it.
02:11:39 And so I go to town, I practice, I practice blade safety.
02:11:43 I'm a master of this katana folded 10,000 times.
02:11:48 I chop the scallions properly this time.
02:11:50 I get rid of the dead skin and flesh.
02:11:52 They're just residually on them.
02:11:53 I wash them properly.
02:11:54 I put in the top ramen.
02:11:55 I put in the sesame oil.
02:11:57 I put in the red pepper flakes and you know what I fucking do?
02:11:59 You dumb fucking slut, instead of using water, I update this shit.
02:12:04 I improvise on this shit.
02:12:05 I use homemade chicken stock instead of that water.
02:12:08 The chicken flavoring is off the charts.
02:12:10 I fucking grill some new bacon and, oh, uh, uh, peanut butter goes right with bacon.
02:12:15 Put that in there as well.
02:12:16 So I'm eating this delicious fucking meal, hell no fresh.
02:12:19 I'm eating this delicious meal that you have given me this recipe.
02:12:23 Moff it to my own specifications.
02:12:24 I take a bite and it is mind blowing.
02:12:28 It is absolutely undescribable.
02:12:32 The pleasure in which I am, in terror, terror taking in when I eat this peanut butter instant
02:12:37 ramen.
02:12:38 The, just the, the emulsification of the peanut butter just make this very light peanut butter
02:12:44 sauce inside of the top ramen is so orgasmic.
02:12:51 Why must, why must brothers quarrel?
02:12:53 Why must there be division?
02:12:55 Hell no fresh.
02:12:56 You are in the voice grail for the rest of my life.
02:12:59 Hit me up.
02:13:00 DM me.
02:13:01 We are brothers in arms.
02:13:02 And you know what?
02:13:03 I think we're going to have a long career together.
02:13:06 And then that's the end of my tale and I've been waiting all week to sell.
02:13:09 That's beautiful.
02:13:10 That's beautiful.
02:13:12 Hell no fresh.
02:13:13 Welcome to the grail.
02:13:14 Welcome to the hollow fame.
02:13:16 Yeah.
02:13:17 I would say that rap alone was enough to get into the grail because that was devastating.
02:13:22 It was Nate.
02:13:23 I think you might have to leave the PCP soon.
02:13:27 Or well you're just going to have to answer with a fire track of your own.
02:13:32 That's the way you get around it.
02:13:33 That's the only option.
02:13:34 That's the way you beat a rap.
02:13:35 Dude, me a mouth of a perfect time.
02:13:38 Make a rap.
02:13:39 Man, I wish I could rap.
02:13:41 Sometimes I think about maybe I should try to compose a rap.
02:13:44 That's too hard.
02:13:45 Hey man, just download a beat as you know, Jesse and did you just do from the internet.
02:13:49 Work on some lyrics.
02:13:50 Yeah.
02:13:51 And do it.
02:13:52 I just have no idea how to like, how do you like write it?
02:13:56 I want to figure out how to write that.
02:13:58 Is there like a structure you follow?
02:13:59 I mean I'm sure you could do it any way you want.
02:14:00 I've made some in the past but I felt too silly, too bad.
02:14:04 You know what?
02:14:05 In the same vein of munchy learning to cook and getting all into it or learning to code.
02:14:10 I want to learn to rap.
02:14:12 I want to figure out that shit out.
02:14:13 I don't know where to start.
02:14:14 I suppose I should just ask Digi but he's Digi.
02:14:18 He might not have like the teacher sort of.
02:14:21 Indeed.
02:14:22 Not an ability to pass on his knowledge.
02:14:23 The aspect.
02:14:24 Nate, I want to move away from the ashes of the Hello Fresh debate and it may come up
02:14:32 but I do want to move into the Forcing Nate to Cook arc which I am going to bring up every
02:14:37 single episode until it happens because you know it has to be done.
02:14:41 You know it has to be done.
02:14:43 I don't care about cooking frankly, I just want to cook like the calories I need in the
02:14:49 day properly.
02:14:50 I don't care about things that taste good.
02:14:51 That seems like a waste of effort to me.
02:14:53 Yeah, I agree, Nate.
02:14:55 I agree.
02:14:56 It's easy to make something that tastes good and is calorie efficient if you can do it
02:14:59 yourself.
02:15:00 If you can make healthy food that's like, you hate your macros and whatnot and you also,
02:15:05 taste great, that'll probably like keep the train running smoothly and you'll be like,
02:15:08 I can't wait to make the food.
02:15:10 Literally the difference between, let me give you a tip.
02:15:14 Cooking tip, any vegetable, any vegetable at all, olive oil or butter, salt and pepper.
02:15:22 Add it to that, roast it in the oven and it's delicious.
02:15:24 There's like no exception to it.
02:15:26 Indeed.
02:15:27 It does, yeah.
02:15:28 The salt just makes it good.
02:15:30 Yeah, that's it.
02:15:32 It's like all you need to do to cook like any fucking vegetable.
02:15:35 You know what I've been doing?
02:15:36 Yeah.
02:15:37 A friend of mine sent me a care package, it was a giant box full of nuts, various nuts.
02:15:44 Oh, it's so thematically appropriate.
02:15:48 Did it have an unsalted variant of a popular nut?
02:15:51 She's specifically, well, she, yes, yes it did and there were a bunch of other timelines
02:16:00 in there too.
02:16:01 Bara nuts, there were peely nuts, there were like tiger nuts, whatever the fuck those
02:16:07 are.
02:16:08 They're trying to do tiger.
02:16:09 But mostly there was like big ass bags of peanuts, cashews and almonds and what I have
02:16:14 been doing is I spent a bunch of yesterday just like roasting trays of these peanuts
02:16:19 because they're uncooked peanuts.
02:16:20 I've been roasting and salting them myself and putting them in mason jars and they're
02:16:24 so good.
02:16:25 That's incredible.
02:16:26 That's incredible.
02:16:27 It's better when you roast them yourself than when you buy them in pre-roasted, oh, it's
02:16:31 so good.
02:16:33 It's like emotionally gratifying, making this raw material undergo this process and transmuting
02:16:40 it into this delicacy.
02:16:42 I feel like I'd be a healthier human if I cooked more, I'd just be more in tune with
02:16:47 the world.
02:16:48 Yeah.
02:16:49 Seems like a real thing.
02:16:50 Just cooking is so fucking, it makes you feel so sexy and desirable as a human being.
02:16:58 I agree.
02:16:59 It's such a great feeling to be able to go downstairs and be like, what do I got in
02:17:02 here?
02:17:03 I got this and then just, I'll make this dish.
02:17:06 Dude, fucking, we're making the peanut butter top ramen and I just like, I looked in the
02:17:11 fridge and I saw that we had the carcass of a chicken and I was like, ah, shit, you know
02:17:14 what I can do?
02:17:15 I can totally make like a quick little sock out of this and it would be really easy and
02:17:19 I can put some of the leftover like meat bits inside of the soup itself.
02:17:23 Like just being resourceful like that while cooking is the best feeling.
02:17:27 Munchy, walk that towards his fridge, third person over the shoulder camera, slowly walk
02:17:33 towards it, looking at his ingredients, going, ah, shit, here we go again.
02:17:37 There's the meme.
02:17:38 Yeah.
02:17:39 There's the one.
02:17:40 With the chicken carcass.
02:17:41 Oh, yep.
02:17:42 Put a chicken carcass there, ladies and gentlemen.
02:17:44 I mean, for me, more than feeling cool and sexy, cooking made me feel efficient because
02:17:48 when I had, you know, when I had my, you know, Instacart all set up, I had my pipeline, like
02:17:53 I knew my ingredients and stuff and I'm just like, okay, well, you know, time to, you know,
02:17:58 I've got all my ingredients that I get and I know where to get them to get them for the
02:18:01 best price.
02:18:02 So they're all really cheap.
02:18:03 So I'm eating for relatively cheap, but I'm still eating well because I'm, you know,
02:18:06 I know what I'm putting into my body or whatever because I'm getting in myself and I'm, you
02:18:10 know, just throwing that cauliflower and shit in a pan and roasting it up and putting it
02:18:13 in a bowl and eating it.
02:18:14 And I'm like, this is exactly what I want to be eating and it's all, it's all like sorted.
02:18:18 Right?
02:18:19 Yeah.
02:18:20 So I've just cleaned out that, that pipeline, the, the nutrition pipeline has been, has
02:18:25 been cleaned and efficient eyes and maximize to deliver nutrition unto me at a minimum
02:18:29 expense.
02:18:30 I do want that.
02:18:31 Well, well, I do love, you know, I'm just into cooking and like as, as like an artistry
02:18:36 and like a passion and like a hobby.
02:18:38 I completely agree that a lot of the joy of cooking is like finding like optimal strats
02:18:44 to saved frames because, you know, I don't always want to like cook like a big ass fucking
02:18:50 I just want to be able to, you know, throw something together really fast and, you know,
02:18:54 get some something that's scrumptious and walk back upstairs.
02:18:57 It's not, it has to always be a federal issue.
02:19:00 Now I'm thinking of like you getting your, you know, meal and then doing the Mario 64
02:19:04 like back, like long jump back.
02:19:07 Yeah.
02:19:08 Yeah.
02:19:09 You know what this reminds me of?
02:19:10 Totally.
02:19:11 Incidentally, I was happy to, I was in a thread about Oolulilia on V the other day and like
02:19:16 in his description, I think this is not like his LinkedIn page or like some, no, it was
02:19:20 his Facebook, I think, and he was like updating like his current work status and like he works
02:19:25 at Walmart, I think, and he said something like, like, you know, he'd been a cashier
02:19:28 for many years and he said something that was along the lines of like, yeah, like my
02:19:33 skill level at like, you know, these like stocking shelves, like blah, blah, blah.
02:19:38 Like these are all like, like, these are all high level, you know, achieved close to mastery,
02:19:44 but when it comes to cashiering, I've maxed out my stats at cashiering.
02:19:48 This is on like a Facebook post, like to his family and friends, he's a good man.
02:19:53 He's a good man.
02:19:54 I've, you know, you know, I started this, this adventure, you know, I became a cashier,
02:19:58 but I think I've done all I can do with the medium and it's time for me to move on to
02:20:02 bigger and better things.
02:20:03 Yeah, pretty much.
02:20:04 Pretty much.
02:20:05 It just like, just like, uh, Watterson retiring from Calvin and Hobbes because he'd done everything
02:20:08 he could do with it.
02:20:09 He's like, I'm going to go out at my peak, I'm going to go out at the peak of my cashiering
02:20:12 career.
02:20:13 Okay.
02:20:14 On top, baby.
02:20:15 That's fantastic.
02:20:16 Okay.
02:20:17 Okay.
02:20:18 Uh, uh, uh, uh, next call is from, uh, Patreon, serious questions, how to get bonus episode.
02:20:23 Okay.
02:20:24 So this one is just, I'll take any excuse to talk about the bonus episode.
02:20:27 So let's, uh, let's listen to it.
02:20:28 Okay.
02:20:29 I have a serious question about the, like the Patreon and when you buy, like the bonus
02:20:32 episodes, how do you get them?
02:20:33 Is it like a private YouTube set of videos and then you get the links to them?
02:20:37 Or is it like MP3 shits you have to download?
02:20:40 It's like, I just want to know how you, what ways you get the episodes so I can know how
02:20:48 to like be able to do them because like, what if I buy the thing on mobile and then it's
02:20:53 like a fucking file that I can't download or some shit, you know, like, let me know
02:20:58 how to, what happens once you buy the bonus episodes.
02:21:01 Like what happens, you know, what, what do I, what happens, you know, what the fuck.
02:21:05 Okay.
02:21:06 We need to convert this potential customer to a full real customer.
02:21:09 And here's how we do it.
02:21:10 We want to change those players into payers.
02:21:12 That's exactly right.
02:21:13 We, uh, uh, okay.
02:21:14 Here's what you do.
02:21:15 So all you got to do on Patreon, you got an account or whatever you sign up and you click
02:21:19 on us wherever you say you want to support us.
02:21:21 You got to say, uh, like the $5 tiers, the one to get the bonus episodes.
02:21:24 And once, once you are there, once like Patreon says like, ah, here's a user who was logged
02:21:28 in as a $5 member or whatever, uh, what the bonus episodes are, they are YouTube videos
02:21:34 that are hidden and only people with the link can get there.
02:21:38 And like, if you, if you are a person, you're a $5 patron, like the bonus episodes are just,
02:21:42 they're on Patreon.
02:21:43 You can click them and play them there on the website, I think, but there's also just
02:21:47 links from there to the YouTube.
02:21:49 And once you're on YouTube, there's a playlist of all the bonus episodes.
02:21:52 And really that's the thing.
02:21:53 A lot of people keep track of it because that's easiest for them, but you can just do it all
02:21:56 through Patreon when there's a new episode released.
02:21:59 So, so there's your answer.
02:22:00 That's how you do it.
02:22:01 Be a patron mostly.
02:22:02 We release the episodes there, you know, the end of the month or whatever.
02:22:05 Uh, so that's it.
02:22:07 Now, give us your money, please.
02:22:08 Uh, uh, I, I have something to say.
02:22:10 Sure.
02:22:11 I have something to say.
02:22:12 Now, it is probably, it is probably possible with the right connections to, uh, this is
02:22:21 like one of those things, Ben, that's like, uh, this is like jury nullification, like
02:22:25 it exists, but if you speak it, you are disqualified from existence.
02:22:29 Well, I just want to, well, I just want to say, I just want to say that, uh, you know,
02:22:33 I know that is a thing that people would probably do and I don't blame them for that,
02:22:38 but consider the fact that we're only asking $5 for like 40 fucking bonus episodes.
02:22:44 There's 25 out now, 25.
02:22:45 So if you, so if you engage in that kind of activity, no judgment, but if you enjoy the
02:22:50 content and you want to, and you want to say thanks, I will like, I will pull you up little
02:22:56 bench.
02:22:57 I've been known to go to Napster.com and download a hot M peg or an MP3 once in a while.
02:23:02 So, so I, I get it kids, I get it, but, uh, yeah, I mean, you know, certainly appreciate
02:23:06 this.
02:23:07 Maybe, maybe I shouldn't, maybe I shouldn't even said anything.
02:23:08 Oh, no, it's fine.
02:23:09 It is what, and, and you know what, uh, bleep that'll allow bleep, bleep everything Ben
02:23:14 said.
02:23:15 Don't cut it, but just bleep it.
02:23:16 I put some safety measures into place and here's what it is guys, even if those leak,
02:23:20 I've taken the sneaky move of, so normally with PCB episodes, we have, uh, uh, an ad
02:23:25 every half an hour, I decided as a compromise in case people decided they wanted to leak
02:23:29 the bonus episodes.
02:23:30 What I've done is I've placed ads at the very beginning and the very end, but not throughout
02:23:35 the episode.
02:23:36 So even if like people want to pass around bonus episodes and they, you know, whatever,
02:23:40 like just the guy that got a ton of views or whatever, we would still get some money.
02:23:44 So it's not like a total loss or anything.
02:23:46 Oh, that's, that's not going to, I mean, it's not going to make a difference, but it's
02:23:50 going to make, that's going to make, I mean, we got like, we got like, I mean, how many
02:23:54 patrons we have a couple hundred or so something like that.
02:23:57 Yeah.
02:23:58 So like, I get it.
02:23:59 So if that number gets, if that number gets boosted up to a solid 500, we're going to
02:24:04 make, we're going to make a cool 20 cents a piece on each of those.
02:24:07 Okay.
02:24:08 You know what?
02:24:09 You might be making a fair point, but the other thing is just that, uh, we can also
02:24:12 see just like the view counts on the bonus episodes.
02:24:14 So like if it goes more than a couple hundred, we know that like, okay, some shenanigans
02:24:18 are up here, but, uh, but that's like never happened.
02:24:20 So I've, uh, I've been pretty, feel pretty confident that most people are, uh, not stealing
02:24:25 it.
02:24:26 Although there was that one episode.
02:24:27 And I'm just saying, I'm just saying pledge to the Patreon for the bonus episodes, sure,
02:24:32 but also just if you like what we do and if you want to support us.
02:24:35 My Patreon, my personal one is just to support my work.
02:24:38 So that model is, it does, it's not, not terrible.
02:24:41 Uh, okay.
02:24:42 Let's move on.
02:24:43 Next one.
02:24:44 We've got a call from, should I make a move on her?
02:24:48 Uh, let's see.
02:24:49 No.
02:24:50 Strong no.
02:24:51 Next question.
02:24:52 I'm going to see detective Pikachu with a girl.
02:24:56 Should I make a move on her like holding hands?
02:25:01 Hmm.
02:25:02 Let me know.
02:25:03 No.
02:25:04 Well, Detective Pikachu, it's nice that you're bringing, you know, fucking like Clefairy to
02:25:08 the premiere of your, your movie, but I don't know, man.
02:25:12 I mean, the thing she resists is you, you know, type.
02:25:15 Yeah.
02:25:16 What are you going to, what are you going to tell your grandkids 50 years down the line
02:25:18 and tell you to, oh, I met your grandma at Detective Pikachu.
02:25:21 No.
02:25:22 You're right.
02:25:23 You're right.
02:25:24 Are you going to tell your fucking dog next year that you snogged your girlfriend while
02:25:29 watching Pikachu snogged Ronald Reynolds?
02:25:32 You know, you know, these men speak wisdom instead of all that.
02:25:36 What you should do is tell no one as you're alone on your deathbed about all the times
02:25:42 you didn't go talk to the girl that you wanted to talk to.
02:25:46 That's a much better solution.
02:25:47 That's right.
02:25:48 Yeah.
02:25:49 I think that's right.
02:25:50 You, you only you and God will know how pure you are.
02:25:53 Holding hands would be all right.
02:25:54 I would say you should try holding hands.
02:25:57 If she's like, get a, get away, get away from me.
02:25:59 I hate you.
02:26:00 Then it's probably something up.
02:26:01 Look, obviously any, any approach or like anything that you do to any girl, like, like
02:26:08 it could be like a great date thing that you're totally into, like, or it could be some kind
02:26:12 of sexual assault.
02:26:13 I'm just saying like, like if you just walk up to a random girl, say nothing and grab
02:26:17 her hand.
02:26:18 That's like technically assault.
02:26:19 Well, no, the city is already going to the thing with a girl.
02:26:22 I mean, even if you're going to a girl that you like know and your friends with, like,
02:26:25 if she's not thinking of you romantically in any way and you just like make a move, then
02:26:30 like you're just setting yourself up for failure.
02:26:32 So you got to, uh, I mean, yeah, like, like, okay, I'll just, here's the little crash course.
02:26:36 You can test the waters here.
02:26:38 And a lot of this is just sensing how she's vibing and if she's into it.
02:26:41 All you got to do is like, like it's little things like, uh, like if she's comfortable,
02:26:45 okay, what do you want to do?
02:26:46 You want to establish physical connection.
02:26:48 I'm just going to let, ask you to let you, let her read your palm, read her palm.
02:26:51 Oh yeah.
02:26:52 Okay.
02:26:53 That's the classic one.
02:26:54 That one's a little corny, a little corny, but like things like read that palm, read
02:26:57 that.
02:26:58 Here's a weird thing.
02:26:59 Okay.
02:27:00 If anybody's ever gone out and like try to hit on girls and stuff, you may sense like
02:27:02 a weird wall appear and it's the wall of like the mutual recognition that neither of
02:27:08 you have ever physically touched the other person.
02:27:11 And as long as that like is there, like there's going to be like a weird kind of aura going
02:27:15 on if you're like trying to get to know this person.
02:27:17 So what you want, you want to smash through that quickly and a lot of guys who are friend
02:27:21 zoned or not necessarily friend zone, but haven't made a move or anything, they don't,
02:27:24 they don't know about this.
02:27:25 And I'm not saying like, grope up girls.
02:27:27 What I'm saying is like, there's nothing wrong with like, when you're hanging out with
02:27:30 a friend, like, you know, whatever, like touching them on the shoulder briefly or like something
02:27:34 like that.
02:27:35 Give her a fucking, give her a high five or whatever.
02:27:36 Yeah.
02:27:37 You know, there's any number of ways to break that, that, that initial like touch barrier.
02:27:42 I'm guessing you are at that place.
02:27:44 But even if you're beyond that, maybe you're, maybe you've hugged or whatever.
02:27:47 It's not weird between you or anything.
02:27:48 But I mean, yeah, just, you know, you got to vibe it out, like have fun, get her laughing.
02:27:53 And then I don't know, I, at some point you got to make the commitment, I guess to try
02:27:57 for the smooch or something.
02:27:58 Just go straight for it.
02:27:59 Okay.
02:28:00 Don't even make it a big like anime Disney like kiss moment.
02:28:03 Like be silly and playful.
02:28:05 And like when you're having fun, when you're goofing around, you've established physical
02:28:07 connection and you're having fun and laughing like, go for like a cheap kiss, like be silly
02:28:12 about it.
02:28:13 Like call it a joke.
02:28:14 But you know,
02:28:15 you're the kiss until Mr. Mime appears on screen and that's your moment, that's your
02:28:19 signal.
02:28:20 I don't know.
02:28:21 Also in general, here's a movie going power move.
02:28:25 You stand on top of the seats in front of you and you just, you like with your arms
02:28:29 crossed.
02:28:30 Oh no.
02:28:31 Yeah.
02:28:32 You T-pose while watching the movie.
02:28:34 In front of your, of your, so she's so that she's looking through your legs at the movie.
02:28:38 You don't, you do not move.
02:28:43 Embracing your sexuality passively.
02:28:44 The entire time.
02:28:45 Yeah.
02:28:46 That's the way to do it.
02:28:47 Yeah.
02:28:48 Give some of that a try.
02:28:49 Well, let us know how it goes.
02:28:50 Yeah.
02:28:51 I don't know.
02:28:52 Let us know how this advice works out for you.
02:28:53 Please do let us know.
02:28:54 Cause I'm curious.
02:28:55 You got, you got to take the, take the leap at some point though.
02:28:57 You know, you can't, you can't, uh, you can't get a girl unless you risk losing her.
02:29:01 I mean, that's absolutely true.
02:29:02 And like, you know, it's not like pin her down and make out with her and not that, not
02:29:06 that kind of risk, my dude, uh, you know, it's not, not unless she signs a waiver.
02:29:10 There's going to be a point.
02:29:11 In triplicate.
02:29:12 Yeah.
02:29:13 And like, I don't know.
02:29:14 I remember struggling with this a lot.
02:29:15 We're like, you know, you're not like letting a girl know you're into her, but at some
02:29:19 point she has to be made aware that you're actually into her.
02:29:23 Um, and I say playfully approaching that like in a humorous way, uh, while, you know, doing
02:29:29 a little physical contact, I think is the way to go.
02:29:32 I would recommend a red nose, white makeup, rainbow wig.
02:29:43 And one of those flowers that you squeeze and the water comes out.
02:29:46 Yep.
02:29:47 Yep.
02:29:48 Just get her nice and moist.
02:29:49 Say it on a unicycle.
02:29:50 You know, that's the new, that's the new shirt.
02:29:51 If you wouldn't say it on a unicycle, why say it at all?
02:29:54 You know, have the car.
02:29:55 Haha.
02:29:56 I like you, honk.
02:29:57 New, new, new shirt on the, on the teespring.
02:29:58 Say it on a unicycle.
02:29:59 I get a custard pie through her in her face the first moment you see her.
02:30:03 Hey, that's contact, right?
02:30:05 Break.
02:30:06 Well, not really.
02:30:07 Okay.
02:30:08 Whatever.
02:30:09 All right.
02:30:10 Hopefully that's enough.
02:30:11 And just be cool.
02:30:12 And that's honestly 90% of it.
02:30:15 Just be yourself.
02:30:16 Lol.
02:30:17 Okay.
02:30:18 Let's move on.
02:30:20 Haha.
02:30:21 That'll, that'll fuck him up.
02:30:22 Sure will.
02:30:23 We've got a call from Nate is a hypocrite spelled with kooky capitalization one.
02:30:28 Okay.
02:30:29 H H I P P O C R I T.
02:30:31 That's correct.
02:30:32 Let's see what we've got.
02:30:34 Let's go at the risk of reopening a can of worms.
02:30:38 Uh, I would like for Nate to clarify his stance in regards to the whole, uh, subscribe
02:30:46 to PewDiePie meme shut down topic from last week's episode.
02:30:51 Um, cause I hear some, uh, some contradictions with Nate's philosophy.
02:30:57 And I just want to give him more credit for more credit than that and, uh, let him defend
02:31:01 his position.
02:31:02 Steelman me, Nate has been a staunch defender of the capitalist market and the capitalist
02:31:07 system.
02:31:09 And this is a perfect example of that, uh, people in the market decided that something
02:31:14 was not profitable anymore.
02:31:16 You know, the, the image of subscribed to PewDiePie and all the baggage that comes with
02:31:20 that, they made the decision to outwardly not support it.
02:31:24 And then the market changed, uh, and this became completely untenable.
02:31:29 So PewDiePie made the capitalist financial decision to change his mind to, uh, respond
02:31:36 to the market so that he could make more money and continue to be a viable brand.
02:31:39 Um, I don't really see the issue here because in a capitalist mindset, this is how social
02:31:46 ideas are, are propagated through, through the whims of the market and through the market
02:31:51 forcing good ideas through.
02:31:53 Um, so I don't know, I'd like you to clarify, Nate.
02:31:56 Okay.
02:31:57 Quick, quick response.
02:31:58 This will be very simple.
02:31:59 Um, you, in your question there, you are embedding the fact that like PewDiePie had to do this
02:32:07 because there was a giant, you know, whatever, like, like his brand was suffering.
02:32:13 Like, okay, like, I get it.
02:32:14 I understand your point there.
02:32:16 Like, I, I don't quite agree with all those points.
02:32:18 And just, just in short, uh, all I want to say is that like, what you're doing is you
02:32:23 are, you're criticizing or you're, you're coming back to me on like the economic level
02:32:27 of, you know, this is the way the social landscape was.
02:32:31 And PewDiePie reacted to it in a way that made sense logically in, you know, don't you
02:32:36 endorse capitalism?
02:32:37 Don't you endorse the free market?
02:32:38 My criticism has nothing to do with people choosing to do what they want in response
02:32:43 to market, market forces or anything.
02:32:46 My criticism is solely having to do with the social framework that led up to that decision.
02:32:52 And it is simply that like, I don't feel that things needed to go this way.
02:32:56 And so, so that is the focus of my criticism.
02:32:59 Obviously people can do whatever they want.
02:33:00 And yeah.
02:33:01 So you are not, so you do not think, so you're not criticizing PewDiePie for saying, for
02:33:08 backing off from the, for saying, don't say subscribe to PewDiePie.
02:33:12 No, I kind of am, but only in the facet of like, I feel that he is validating this point
02:33:19 by like acquiescing to, you know, this, this is something I realized after the discussion
02:33:26 and I left a comment on the, the episode explaining why I think there was so much arguing during
02:33:32 that.
02:33:33 It's because there is two sort of angles to take this from there's the viewer's perspective
02:33:40 and then the content creators perspective, like this guy's talking about, it's more logical
02:33:44 and capitalist to do this stuff, which is what I was arguing at the time.
02:33:49 But Nate is more arguing about the fact that socially he wishes that this just wouldn't
02:33:55 happen this way.
02:33:56 Yeah, that's true.
02:33:57 My comment is more in depth.
02:33:59 If you go back to the episode, you'll see it.
02:34:00 Okay.
02:34:01 Well, I mean, that's all I got to say on this.
02:34:03 So I mean, frankly, we can just move on.
02:34:04 Well, I don't wait, wait, no, I'm going to prod you because I don't think you've answered
02:34:08 this guy's question.
02:34:09 No, I think I did.
02:34:10 No, because like, well, you said, well, you said that, yeah, you still think PewDiePie
02:34:14 shouldn't have done it.
02:34:15 Yeah.
02:34:16 But, but not for like, not because I'm actually being counter to myself and being anti-capitalist.
02:34:21 I understand you have to do with the market dictates.
02:34:23 My criticism is of the social like reality.
02:34:28 I'm like, I like, basically my point is I wish people would not let these things, you
02:34:32 know, let the influence them.
02:34:34 So you're, so you're not criticizing PewDiePie's decision.
02:34:36 Ben, no, in part I am for one reason.
02:34:40 On the other hand, I understand why he made it.
02:34:43 That's my point.
02:34:44 Well, if you understand why he made it and it was the right thing to do for capital
02:34:49 God damn it.
02:34:50 Why would you criticize it?
02:34:51 You must understand nuance, right?
02:34:53 There are things to be discussed.
02:34:54 It's not just one topic.
02:34:55 I understand that you're, I understand that you're trying to have it both ways here.
02:34:57 Ben, what the fuck?
02:34:58 I don't want to talk to you for a minute.
02:34:59 No, no, no, no, no.
02:35:00 This is exactly why we sent the conversation last time.
02:35:01 This is one different answer.
02:35:02 Why won't you fucking answer my question?
02:35:03 I answered you three times, Ben.
02:35:05 But no, you haven't.
02:35:06 The answer is clear.
02:35:07 We can all understand what Nate's saying.
02:35:08 We can all understand.
02:35:09 No, I can't.
02:35:10 But everyone else understands except you.
02:35:12 You're the problem.
02:35:13 You haven't, you haven't.
02:35:14 No, you're trying to draw in the ways that are trying to make him look bad all the time.
02:35:17 No, you've just given a, you've just given a non-answer.
02:35:20 The answer is that he doesn't have an issue with that side of the debate.
02:35:24 He does not have a problem with the fact that PewDiePie made it for an economic reasons.
02:35:27 He has issue with the fact that he was forced to make this decision not because of the market
02:35:32 problem, but he just upset that the social, that's what the social plane is like right
02:35:38 now.
02:35:39 Ben, I'll give you your answer.
02:35:41 So what's to criticize about PewDiePie's decision then?
02:35:44 It's about the social aspect of it.
02:35:46 That's not what he said.
02:35:47 No, for fuck's sake, there is two aspects to PewDiePie's decision.
02:35:52 There is both the capitalist, good money management thing and the social thing.
02:35:57 It's not one or the other.
02:35:58 So I'm sorry, but my answer is I'm conflicted on it.
02:36:00 That's my, I'm so sorry that I don't have a clear yes or no, and it's not about that
02:36:05 I just actually hate fucking capitalism.
02:36:08 It's actually wrong.
02:36:09 Gotcha, gotcha, Nate, gotcha.
02:36:11 This is retarded.
02:36:12 Let's move on.
02:36:13 Okay, whatever.
02:36:14 Because it's, it's, it's that it has both aspects.
02:36:17 One, the capitalist, Nate agrees with the other, he doesn't agree with, therefore conflicted.
02:36:22 Yeah, but-
02:36:23 I mean, I get it.
02:36:24 But then, but you, okay, I'm just confused because when I say that, you, like, it seems
02:36:30 like your criticism of PewDiePie is something that other people did.
02:36:35 No, no, no, no, okay, because I said before, my criticism is that I feel he acquiesced
02:36:40 and I think that strengthens their argument.
02:36:42 And I, I mean, again, I might have done the exact same thing because I'm not like an invincible
02:36:46 super god of, you know, I wouldn't even say morals, like, of whatever, standing up for
02:36:51 myself or, you know, fighting on my own behalf or whatever.
02:36:54 But like, but I, to me, I, what I see is, you know, a little bit of giving in and I,
02:36:59 you know, I'm just, just, they say in my piece, I don't, I wish he hadn't, but that's, that's
02:37:04 how it seems to me.
02:37:05 That's it.
02:37:06 Is that more reasonable?
02:37:07 But that, well, no, but let's continue.
02:37:11 Okay.
02:37:12 Gangster's PCP Paradise.
02:37:15 Please save us.
02:37:16 Oh no.
02:37:17 Bro, have you guys seen the Sonic Movie Trailer?
02:37:19 It looks so fucking radical, dude, like, radical, tactical.
02:37:22 Oh my God.
02:37:23 Holy shit.
02:37:24 I love it.
02:37:25 It's Gangster's Paradise.
02:37:26 That's the song.
02:37:41 Hey, all right, you did save us, Gangster's PCP Paradise.
02:37:54 Let's talk about how mad I am that people are happy that they're fixing Sonic's character
02:38:00 design.
02:38:01 Well, okay, so there's the artistic, like, okay, you could say like, hey man, respect
02:38:06 the artist's vision.
02:38:07 So you know, just let them do what they want, but on the other hand, I mean, I never thought
02:38:10 this one looked very good.
02:38:12 So I guess I don't think it, I, well, it's not that I think that you need to respect
02:38:17 this artist's vision.
02:38:18 It's not that I think this is sacred, it shouldn't be changed.
02:38:21 It's that, like, it's like, why would you be happy about anything related to this?
02:38:27 If it's changing, it might improve, I guess.
02:38:30 The design could get better, but I think the problem is the entire thing.
02:38:33 Oh, I get it.
02:38:34 I get it.
02:38:35 It's just seems so doomed to begin with.
02:38:37 If I had seen this trailer and Sonic had looked like Sonic, would I have been like, oh, looks
02:38:44 good.
02:38:45 Well, yeah, I guess not.
02:38:46 I know it's not.
02:38:48 I've heard, like, like, probably baseless rumors, but it was interesting as a thought
02:38:53 that Christian came out in the movie.
02:38:56 Yeah.
02:38:57 No, that this initial trailer was made as deliberately really bad and they had like
02:39:03 a backup better looking Sonic.
02:39:05 And this was all to build hype for the movie, to get people talking about it.
02:39:08 You know, these are the kind of nimbus who would do that shit, the Sonic 2.
02:39:11 I don't think that corporation, like, that seems like a really risky move that I don't
02:39:16 see a big company taking.
02:39:17 It's risky, but it's also risky to, like, remake the whole of the animation as well.
02:39:22 That's a lot of money that I'll have to spend to do that.
02:39:25 It's, yeah, true.
02:39:26 It seems that way, though.
02:39:28 I don't know.
02:39:29 I don't think companies are competent enough.
02:39:31 I would probably say that this was not a scheme, but, like, it worked out so well.
02:39:35 Like, people are so hyped to hear that, like, they're changing the character design.
02:39:39 It seems like it was planned.
02:39:40 It's like the new Coke thing.
02:39:42 Like people that the Coke introduced new Coke just so they could bring back a classic Coke,
02:39:47 which I don't know, it's possible.
02:39:49 If so, it was an incredibly risky move.
02:39:50 These are very large brain moves that I cannot follow, but I mean, maybe.
02:39:53 I think the reason people are excited in the first place, is it even because, like, oh,
02:39:58 the movie's gonna be great now.
02:39:59 I think it's just the fucking amazing fact that, like, oh, this big Hollywood machine
02:40:05 that just shits out bullshit is actually listening to constructive criticism, instead of just
02:40:10 calling out everyone for being fake fans and being gay and yelling at everyone for complaining
02:40:14 about something.
02:40:15 I mean, if I had to guess.
02:40:16 That is shocking.
02:40:17 That is actually happening.
02:40:18 I think that's where the kind of rejoicing is coming from.
02:40:22 It's like, wow, there's actually a dialogue happening on this platform designed for dialogue.
02:40:27 What company is making this?
02:40:28 Paramount.
02:40:30 Paramount.
02:40:31 They're all owned by Coke, anyway.
02:40:34 I want to say a small thought that has come up with the Sonic movie.
02:40:38 Okay, so this is gonna get a tiny little bit philosophical, but when you are a person
02:40:45 with ideas and an ideology, and then you reach a point in your life when you want to reject
02:40:54 those ideas that you've had before in your life, and you think to yourself, no, this
02:40:58 is not how I should be anymore.
02:41:00 I have to stop some of the vices which I have been displaying.
02:41:07 I have to make some changes in my life.
02:41:10 Then it's easy to look at the way you act and the way that you feel and say, time to
02:41:15 do the opposite.
02:41:17 This is not working out for me.
02:41:18 I need to pull back, and pulling back can be a gradient.
02:41:24 It doesn't have to be, you know, you completely turn heel and then whip the other way.
02:41:28 The reason I say this is because I agree with the people who say there's too much cynicism
02:41:35 in the online space.
02:41:37 There's too many people who are too willing to just shit down movies or art in general
02:41:43 or online creations.
02:41:44 People are too cynical and mean and write things off too easily.
02:41:48 But that doesn't mean that everything needs to be happy.
02:41:53 That doesn't mean that you have to always try and just, you know, steal a man or look
02:42:00 on the bright side of some issues.
02:42:03 Sometimes, knee-jerk reactions are valid.
02:42:08 You don't have to just pretend the SOG movie is going to be good for the sake of being
02:42:14 positive.
02:42:15 That's true.
02:42:16 Stop it, please.
02:42:18 I don't know, maybe you'll surprise us.
02:42:20 It will be glorious.
02:42:21 It will be glorious when it's a tough dumpster fire.
02:42:24 The thing is, I've never liked Sonic.
02:42:26 Like ever.
02:42:27 Yeah, in any way.
02:42:29 We can't encourage people, we can't encourage people to go see the movie.
02:42:33 Just morbid curiosity, just to see how bad it is.
02:42:35 Yeah, we should pull a little more money into the pockets of this company because it's
02:42:40 going to be so funny to laugh at them as they laugh all the way to the bank.
02:42:44 Yeah, that's true.
02:42:45 On my dollar.
02:42:46 What I'm trying to say is that, like, I've seen people, I've talked to people who are
02:42:50 like, um, but you know, it won't be, you know, there's some problems, but you know, like
02:42:54 look on the bright side, like no, no, I won't, we don't have to do that for everything.
02:42:58 I agree that there could be more of that in general, but it's the Sonic movie.
02:43:02 Look on the bright side, I could spend money, I could spend money to a big corporation,
02:43:07 I let the bright side.
02:43:09 Somebody's going to buy a yacht.
02:43:11 Isn't that, isn't that beautiful?
02:43:13 Isn't that lovely?
02:43:14 Yeah.
02:43:15 I contribute to some guy's yacht.
02:43:17 Some guy, some guy deserved it, you know, for making the Sonic movie.
02:43:21 He took the initiative, he made it happen, and God bless him.
02:43:25 I'm sure whoever stole my bicycle is having a better time with it than I would in the
02:43:29 industry.
02:43:30 Oh, that's so true.
02:43:31 Yeah, yeah.
02:43:32 He's going to have happiness.
02:43:33 That's not like an Alturid comic.
02:43:34 Those big-wig fat cats are going to enjoy my money more than I would have.
02:43:39 What was that Alturid comic?
02:43:42 I believe you're talking about bike-cuck, based.
02:43:45 He's enjoying my bike more than I would have enjoyed still having it.
02:43:49 By the way, slide it into my Sonic stance.
02:43:52 I just want to go on the record.
02:43:53 I played Sonic Advance 1, 2, and 3, and those were great games, so I don't hate Sonic entirely.
02:43:58 I just think that he's kind of lame.
02:44:00 That was fucking amazing.
02:44:01 But okay.
02:44:02 Sonic was shit because I played it on my flip-flop, and it was the best time of my life.
02:44:06 All right, that's sick.
02:44:07 Okay, but check this out.
02:44:08 Next voicemail is from Elmo recommends a sword game.
02:44:12 So let's see what he's about.
02:44:15 Go.
02:44:16 Yes, please.
02:44:17 Hello, everybody.
02:44:18 I have heard that you all love sword games.
02:44:23 The best one Elmo has played is the owner.
02:44:28 It has directional combat.
02:44:31 Hey, we were talking about that.
02:44:33 It's like Dark Souls if it was actually good.
02:44:42 Yay.
02:44:43 I know what the best looks like with a controller.
02:44:48 So the swords to release are easier to point.
02:44:53 Elmo hopes you all have so much fun.
02:44:57 Goodbye.
02:44:59 Bitches.
02:45:00 Bye.
02:45:01 Bye, Arlo.
02:45:02 Hello.
02:45:03 Here's some canon lore.
02:45:05 That is Red Man's cousin.
02:45:08 Elmo.
02:45:09 Yeah, that sounds right.
02:45:10 That sounds right.
02:45:11 I think Arlo was blood this whole time.
02:45:15 We're going to Arlo to call in, guys, I just watched the last episode of the PCP, and I
02:45:23 just wanted to comment on Ben St's keto recipes.
02:45:28 That's what I want.
02:45:30 He's a keto man as well.
02:45:31 You don't know the half of it.
02:45:33 I don't.
02:45:34 Look at his physique.
02:45:35 Ben second.
02:45:36 Oh, my God.
02:45:37 Look at those blue feathers.
02:45:38 He's not a hardcore keto, but didn't I tell you about me getting that recipe for keto
02:45:42 pizza crust?
02:45:43 Yeah, I just didn't know if that could have been kind of a coincidence if he was doing
02:45:46 keto something.
02:45:47 I mean, he's not full keto.
02:45:48 He just wanted to lower his carb intake.
02:45:51 Arlo is what happens when you go full keto.
02:45:54 So he's a coward, basically.
02:45:57 What is the deal with Elmo?
02:45:59 Why do kids like Elmo?
02:46:00 I mean, because they're babies and he's nice.
02:46:02 Because he's got a high voice and they pushed it really hard, I guess.
02:46:06 I know.
02:46:07 I've met babies who just fucking are apeshit for Elmo, and I'm like, dude, what's the
02:46:10 deal?
02:46:11 And I'm like, what's even the disarmed kutzwerk at work here?
02:46:13 I don't even fucking get it.
02:46:14 You go down to your local vape shop and all the babies are in there.
02:46:18 Vape it away.
02:46:19 You start up a little conversation with them.
02:46:21 They're talking about Elmo again.
02:46:22 Oh, these guys suck.
02:46:23 It's like, hey, explain it to me.
02:46:25 Explain Elmo.
02:46:26 I want to get it.
02:46:27 I want to understand.
02:46:28 Like, tell me what it is.
02:46:29 Like, what am I missing here?
02:46:30 They go Google GaGa and they take a hit of that vape.
02:46:34 All right.
02:46:35 Let's get the hell out of here.
02:46:36 She's a cookie monster on the whole plane.
02:46:38 Wait, cookie monster, total killer.
02:46:41 Yeah, that's true.
02:46:42 That's true.
02:46:43 No, no.
02:46:44 Cookie monster's a big rowdy.
02:46:46 He eats baked goods.
02:46:49 Therefore, he can't be a killer because he's not keto.
02:46:52 I think Big Bird's a killer, though.
02:46:54 Big Bird's a juvie.
02:46:56 Kermit, Kermit the Frog's a killer.
02:46:57 Kermit?
02:46:58 Yeah.
02:46:59 I don't know.
02:47:00 He seemed like a real juvie to me.
02:47:01 He's like a neutral arbiter of wisdom.
02:47:02 Oh, yeah.
02:47:03 I don't know.
02:47:04 I don't know.
02:47:05 Oh, God.
02:47:06 You know, the thing about, the best thing about living in Slime City is that you can change.
02:47:10 You can betray your faction.
02:47:11 That's true.
02:47:12 You can contain multitudes.
02:47:13 You can be whatever you want to be in New Los Angeles City.
02:47:16 One can be many.
02:47:17 You can watch the slime economy crumble in Neo-Milwaukee.
02:47:19 You can hear this juvie stomach's rumble.
02:47:21 Well, on that note.
02:47:22 Quotes.
02:47:23 Oh, fucking quickly.
02:47:25 Animal, Red Man's uncle.
02:47:27 Oh, animal.
02:47:28 Oh, yeah.
02:47:29 Okay.
02:47:30 They're all canon.
02:47:31 There's a full Sesame Street lore tied in with Red Man.
02:47:34 Don't even get him started.
02:47:35 Yeah.
02:47:36 Okay.
02:47:37 Here we go.
02:47:38 I should try and find out how to buy a Muppet of Red Man.
02:47:41 Unsee Arlo as the chief Muppet man on YouTube.
02:47:45 Okay.
02:47:46 Here we go.
02:47:47 She-Pollution role-playing as a PCP member.
02:47:51 Let's commence.
02:47:54 How many more voicemails do we have to listen to?
02:47:57 I don't know what these fuckers are doing, but I got deadline.
02:48:00 I got people waiting for me for my next big project.
02:48:03 It will be great.
02:48:04 It will be the best thing they'll ever see.
02:48:06 But I can't finish it as long as these fucking voicemails keep coming up.
02:48:10 And they all suck.
02:48:11 All the voicemails suck.
02:48:12 Oh, I hate them.
02:48:13 I wish they all died in a shit.
02:48:17 A shitty poopy shit.
02:48:20 Yes.
02:48:21 So my question is, how accurate does this describe you?
02:48:28 Not necessarily right now, but just in general, when you're recording an episode and you're
02:48:32 nearing the end, how much do you want it to end so you can continue working on your project?
02:48:37 Ironically, 100% this is the most related I've ever been to personally.
02:48:42 Yeah, yeah.
02:48:43 Right now.
02:48:44 Very specifically right now.
02:48:45 Well, I spend the voicemails waiting for real my ass back.
02:48:50 Well, you're in luck there, Ben, because we've got one coming up next right here, baby.
02:48:54 All right.
02:48:55 Yeah.
02:48:56 Let's get into it immediately.
02:48:57 Here we go.
02:48:58 Riddle my ass, Batman.
02:48:59 The song continues right now.
02:49:00 Wait, what?
02:49:01 Okay.
02:49:02 It didn't work.
02:49:03 Wait, sorry.
02:49:04 Hang on.
02:49:05 Hang on.
02:49:06 I don't know what that was about.
02:49:07 Okay.
02:49:08 Copy.
02:49:09 Riddle my ass, Batman is canceled.
02:49:10 And okay, let's try again.
02:49:11 Go.
02:49:12 Is your eye better, Batman?
02:49:13 Yes, Riddle.
02:49:14 Good.
02:49:15 Because I want you to see the next poor soul you failed to save.
02:49:19 You, Riddle, let's go ahead with the riddles.
02:49:22 I have four legs on which to stand.
02:49:27 It's my eyes skimmed by, watching on the slide.
02:49:31 When I'm hungry, it's grass I eat, soaking in Africa's heat.
02:49:35 Big and fierce, but cute as well.
02:49:38 It's well known that I yell, yawn and toot.
02:49:41 Who am I, Batman?
02:49:43 It's the first riddle you give me that doesn't suck, Riddle.
02:49:47 The answer is hippo.
02:49:49 Very well.
02:49:50 Riddle at least a minute.
02:49:52 Thank you, Batman.
02:49:53 Thank you, Batman.
02:49:54 Thank you, Batman.
02:49:55 Hippo.
02:49:56 I just want you to know that when a dating sim comes out, I'm choosing you as my lover.
02:50:00 Wow.
02:50:01 Whoa.
02:50:02 Thank you, Batman.
02:50:04 Crash.
02:50:05 Holy heartwarming, heartwarming hippos, Batman.
02:50:09 I never paid you as a hippo fan.
02:50:11 Why not?
02:50:12 He's the funniest.
02:50:13 By the way, did you bring the stuff?
02:50:15 Yes, Batman.
02:50:16 Yeah.
02:50:17 Robin finally arrived in the battlefield.
02:50:19 Well, the supplies he brought me enough to save the merinimias of the PCP to the next
02:50:23 time I find out.
02:50:24 Same PCP time.
02:50:26 Same PCP channel.
02:50:28 Whoo.
02:50:29 Oh, the glorious.
02:50:30 That's why you're the chief of the Hall of Fame.
02:50:35 Yeah.
02:50:36 Goddamn.
02:50:37 Once again.
02:50:38 Every time.
02:50:39 What was that about taking you as his lover?
02:50:41 In the PCP dating sim.
02:50:42 In the PCP dating sim.
02:50:44 Oh, yes.
02:50:45 He's a fan.
02:50:46 He's following at PCP dating daily.
02:50:49 Wow.
02:50:50 Incredible.
02:50:51 That was great.
02:50:52 As always.
02:50:53 I'm flattered.
02:50:54 What a...
02:50:55 And I'm safe.
02:50:56 Yes, you are.
02:50:57 Most of us are safe now.
02:50:58 For now.
02:50:59 For now.
02:51:00 Who's still there?
02:51:01 I'm sure this is all part of Riddle My Ass' plan.
02:51:04 It could be.
02:51:05 So it's all part of his grand plan.
02:51:06 I think so.
02:51:07 I think he's building to something incredible.
02:51:08 But let me see.
02:51:09 I think Jesse and Digi are still up there.
02:51:12 Anybody else?
02:51:13 I can't think of anybody else.
02:51:14 I don't know.
02:51:15 The Davoo.
02:51:16 The Davoo.
02:51:17 No, Davoo's been saved.
02:51:18 Davoo saved.
02:51:19 When have we got Davoo?
02:51:20 Oh, did we?
02:51:21 Oh, oh, oh, oh.
02:51:22 I think that was last episode.
02:51:23 Davoo saved.
02:51:24 I think everybody else is saved.
02:51:25 I think there's only those two left.
02:51:26 Unless I'm forgetting something.
02:51:27 But the sagas nearing its conclusion, ladies and gentlemen.
02:51:30 Will Batman be able to continue to puzzle out these epic reasoning games?
02:51:36 We'll see.
02:51:37 It seems like Riddle My Ass Batman's riddles are getting better.
02:51:40 They are improving.
02:51:41 He's growing more powerful.
02:51:42 Yeah.
02:51:43 The problem is with only two people left to choose, it really narrows down the focus
02:51:48 of who's going to be the answer.
02:51:53 He's going to have a tough time with that last one.
02:51:55 There's only one person left.
02:51:57 Well, it'll be Digi, and Digi will have not been on an episode in months, and so he'll
02:52:01 forget that he's a member.
02:52:02 He'll be like, uh, uh, Jeff, no, no, gone.
02:52:06 Well, we'll see.
02:52:08 We'll see what happens.
02:52:09 But anyway, I guess that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
