00:00:00 I'm sorry darling, I'm listening to the PCP right now, it's so interesting.
00:00:23 Surprise motherfucker, it's me, Best guy ever back from The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:30 You thought you were rid of me, but no, I am eternal and I'm come back and I'm bronzed
00:00:36 and I'm beautiful like none of you will ever be or even understand.
00:00:40 With me is Ben Saint.
00:00:43 Everyone put away the good weed.
00:00:46 We only smoke shit weed when this guy is around.
00:00:53 I'm here, I'm ready to turn in, I'm ready to phone it in for another PC paycheck.
00:01:00 Oh yeah.
00:01:01 Digibro is there as well.
00:01:04 The motherfucking mission, get that quack.
00:01:09 Agreed.
00:01:10 And also Mage.
00:01:12 Yes, I am alive as I usually am.
00:01:18 Well fantastic.
00:01:20 Well here we are today, post Christmas.
00:01:23 How was your Christmas guys?
00:01:25 I had a good one.
00:01:27 You know what?
00:01:28 I guess I wish Christmas shit.
00:01:29 Damn.
00:01:30 Alright, I got a bunch of chocolate that I'm not going to eat.
00:01:35 I'm donating it to the poor, a.k.a. my fucking housemates.
00:01:41 Yeah, that sounds like the poor.
00:01:43 I'm curious, because you guys are brothers, did you have any kind of, did you guys meet
00:01:49 at all in this Christmas?
00:01:51 No, Nate betrayed us.
00:01:55 Betrayed his family lineage and went to Hawaii instead.
00:02:01 For the first time ever, it was not all of us together for Christmas.
00:02:05 Which made me a little sad.
00:02:06 It was the first time ever.
00:02:07 Yeah, it made all of us sad.
00:02:08 Made all of us real sad.
00:02:09 Aw man.
00:02:10 You might say it ruined Christmas.
00:02:13 Not my words, not my words.
00:02:15 It's good to know that my absence is felt deeply and woundingly by those who know of
00:02:25 me and respect me greatly.
00:02:27 Yeah, it was too bad, but you know, also fuck you guys, so I had a good time out there.
00:02:35 My gift, basically, to me on Christmas was to be in a very sunny, beautiful place.
00:02:41 It was like, I want a white Christmas, white sand, that is.
00:02:45 Yeah, also not so many blacks.
00:02:47 Not so many blacks, let's just, you know, tropical cocaine.
00:02:52 Although a lot more browns, you know, because there's a lot more Asians, a lot more Filipinos
00:02:55 and a lot of, of course, native Hawaiians as well.
00:02:58 Whoa, I'm clogging my ears.
00:03:01 I love none of this.
00:03:02 Hey, by the way, have you guys seen?
00:03:04 This tickles me pink, or perhaps other colors, because if you invert the word brown, it kind
00:03:10 of looks like N-word backwards.
00:03:12 That's all that.
00:03:13 This is, this is making the rounds, and I feel like there's something important going
00:03:16 on here.
00:03:17 Hold on, I'm trying to picture it in my head, but I can't.
00:03:19 Yeah, take your time.
00:03:21 Literally N-word, like that, like literally the phrase N-word, you gotta picture that.
00:03:28 Oh, if you switch the B to a D, because it's reversed.
00:03:31 Yeah, exactly, exactly.
00:03:32 Wait, hold on.
00:03:33 It just works.
00:03:34 It just works.
00:03:35 Link in the description.
00:03:36 This is important to show notes, kind of.
00:03:38 Oh, RD.
00:03:39 Oh my God.
00:03:40 Oh my God.
00:03:41 Well, this changes everything.
00:03:43 Yeah, I know.
00:03:44 I know.
00:03:45 Anyway, it was great, it was nice, so it was with Michelle's family, and we had a wonderful
00:03:52 time.
00:03:53 Yeah, that's it.
00:03:54 Went swimming a lot, did beachy things.
00:03:56 I am, in fact, quite bronzed.
00:03:58 In fact, we have to link in the show notes to instagram.com slash bestestguyever.
00:04:03 We can see my bronze.
00:04:05 Hey, remember when you called us up on Christmas, and we all started chanting a vote for Trump,
00:04:13 build that wall?
00:04:14 I do.
00:04:15 Oh, what a magical time.
00:04:18 I can't even imagine being at the fucking beach, because I was up in the frozen north
00:04:23 of Rochester, where there was snow, and there actually isn't snow here in Boston this year,
00:04:29 so far.
00:04:30 Yeah, I had a good time, because I was also with May at her family, and they have like,
00:04:39 you know how they say like, divorced parents have two Christmases?
00:04:43 She's got that on top of that her mom's family has like three Christmases themselves, because
00:04:49 it's like every different grandparent gathers like a huge, it's a gigantic Italian Catholic
00:04:55 family, so there's like a thousand people, and like a million events.
00:04:59 So it was like a jam-packed like Christmas schedule, you know, it wasn't just like one
00:05:05 day event, it was like a week long Christmas Trist.
00:05:10 It was like a Hanukkah for the Christians.
00:05:12 That sounds exhausting, to be honest.
00:05:15 Well when you've got a dab pen and a lot of alcohol, and you know, you're getting lots
00:05:22 of free stuff from people you've literally never even seen before in your life, it's
00:05:26 pretty exciting.
00:05:27 I feel like I want one of those, you know, muscly arm like handshake picks, the meme
00:05:33 with the text over both arms, one that's like, I don't know, epic memers, and then vapors,
00:05:39 and then in the middle is loving the dab, you know, something along those lines.
00:05:44 There's potential there, there's potential.
00:05:46 Hey, so hey remember, you know what this podcast has been missing a lot of recently?
00:05:54 It's been missing that, it was the sauce in the good old days, was me vaping into the
00:05:59 microphone.
00:06:00 Oh yeah, that's true.
00:06:01 Did you get a new vape?
00:06:02 Did Santa bring you a shiny new vape for Christmas?
00:06:07 Actually our sister just gave me a jewel, so I'm jewelin'.
00:06:11 Oh boy.
00:06:12 Oh okay.
00:06:13 Oh yeah.
00:06:14 Wait, what's the jewel again?
00:06:15 That's just like a little baby one, right?
00:06:16 It's just a small little like vape thing that looks like a USB.
00:06:19 God, you're so degenerate out there.
00:06:22 Yeah, yeah.
00:06:23 She had a spare one, and she was like, I don't use this one anymore, you can have it.
00:06:26 Guys, currently right now in New York, they are in the process of simultaneously legalizing
00:06:32 marijuana and trying to ban like jewels and vapes.
00:06:38 I assume by ban, they mean like in the same way cigarettes are banned like from like public
00:06:44 areas, like as opposed to completely illegal.
00:06:46 No, they're just trying to take jewels off the market because they think that too many
00:06:50 like kids are the ones who like it's basically marketed to kids the way they see it, I guess.
00:06:55 Well, they are popular with the youth, which is bad.
00:06:59 I don't think kids should be should be vape and nicotine.
00:07:02 That's weird.
00:07:04 But I mean, I don't know.
00:07:06 Yeah, I don't see commercials.
00:07:07 I mean, they don't sell them to kids.
00:07:08 So it's like, what are they fucking?
00:07:11 Is it the same way that kids get alcohol?
00:07:13 Like kids are going to get their hands on the thing, you know, yeah, yeah.
00:07:17 Like if they it like, yeah, illegally, I mean, they're you can just get somebody to buy it
00:07:21 for you, assumably.
00:07:22 I mean, if anyone under 18 is smoking jewels, then obviously that's not a fault of it's
00:07:28 not.
00:07:29 I don't think it's cause for them to be banned unless you were going to ban everything else
00:07:32 that kids could also do that.
00:07:34 They didn't ban cigarettes because Joe Camel was a kid friendly advertisement.
00:07:39 They just said you can't run those ads anymore.
00:07:41 It's not cool.
00:07:42 Although, I guess a lot of the limitations on sales were probably put in for those reasons.
00:07:46 Well, I mean, aside from it being like, you know, what is it now 18 or older, I guess
00:07:50 for cigarettes, I like all the warnings that they were like forced to put on the cartons
00:07:54 and like, I don't know, does that shit even work?
00:07:57 Does that have an effect?
00:07:58 I don't know.
00:07:59 I don't know.
00:08:00 Uh, they got them, they got, they got warnings on, on jewel stuff, they got warnings on vape
00:08:05 stuff.
00:08:06 Yeah.
00:08:07 So like, you know, the system seems to be working properly.
00:08:09 Well, fair enough.
00:08:11 Uh, I don't know.
00:08:12 Is vaping even particularly bad for you other than that you get addicted to nicotine?
00:08:17 No.
00:08:18 It's kind of undiscovered thus far, right?
00:08:20 Isn't the science still kind of out on that?
00:08:23 I mean, sure.
00:08:24 I mean, yeah, in the sense that any scientific theory is always, you know, subject to future
00:08:32 evidence, you know, in order to, to shift consensus.
00:08:36 I guess so.
00:08:37 But, uh, you know, all, like none of the, none of the chemicals in it are like known
00:08:42 carcinogens.
00:08:43 It, it, okay.
00:08:45 People argue with me about this, but like I've done reading on it and I'm pretty convinced
00:08:49 that, that nothing in it is actually like dangerous, like to, to even like a, a, a,
00:08:55 to even like, like a, a, a percent of the degree that like the stuff in cigarette, like the
00:09:00 stuff in cigarettes we know causes you cancer, it just, it just does.
00:09:03 Oh, that's fair.
00:09:04 But like people would also make that same argument about sugar, which I would argue is poisoning
00:09:10 a large amount of the human population.
00:09:12 Well, you know what?
00:09:13 I think that I would probably be okay if we said that, if vaping is, is, is poison on
00:09:19 the same level as like sugar.
00:09:21 I, I guess that's fair.
00:09:22 I guess that's fair.
00:09:23 Yeah.
00:09:24 Uh, but hey, Mage, well, how was your Christmas?
00:09:26 What'd you get up to?
00:09:27 Uh, it was, it was fine.
00:09:28 As always, I went to visit my family and was gone for the week or so and been on my phone.
00:09:34 Uh, was, was Santa kind to you?
00:09:37 Did he, did he lean your, did he lovingly take your, your head in his arms and caress
00:09:42 you on that Christmas morning as is little Lithuanian custom.
00:09:46 Uh, sorry.
00:09:47 Yo, wait.
00:09:48 He's a very, he's a very my, he's a very intimate man in Lithuanian lore, as I understand
00:09:54 it.
00:09:55 No, uh, I said, um, you guys have Krampus over there?
00:09:59 No.
00:10:00 I tell you, we got Krampus over here and it fucking sucks, man.
00:10:03 You have, you have Chris, you have Chris Kindle.
00:10:05 No.
00:10:06 Oh, you know, some, some, some places have the Chris Kindle.
00:10:09 Yeah.
00:10:10 It's like Western Europe, I'm Eastern Europe, but uh, yeah, like Santa's not, not, not super
00:10:17 generous with poor, to poor people.
00:10:20 Oh no.
00:10:21 Uh, but I didn't, I didn't get a thing, uh, sort of two things, I guess.
00:10:26 Um, yeah.
00:10:27 Lay it on us.
00:10:28 Yeah.
00:10:29 I got, I got a new handbag that I didn't, I didn't request specifically, but it's kind
00:10:34 of a funny story.
00:10:35 Is it that Gucci?
00:10:37 Is it that Louis?
00:10:38 No.
00:10:39 No, it's not, it's not anything.
00:10:40 Expensive.
00:10:41 It looks nice though.
00:10:42 So, I mean, I don't care for brands, so it doesn't bother me, but uh, uh, it's red though.
00:10:47 And that's a little bit of a, for me, but it's kind of my fault.
00:10:51 How bold.
00:10:52 Red though.
00:10:53 Yeah.
00:10:54 I don't usually wear red, so it's a little weird, but, but like I said, it's kind of
00:10:57 my fault because during the summer, I'm, uh, me and my mom went for some shopping because
00:11:02 she insisted I got new shoes, but my old shoes are fine, but she insisted I got new shoes.
00:11:07 I hate shoes shopping.
00:11:08 I absolutely hate shoe shopping, but yeah, we went, yeah, we went shoe shopping and the
00:11:14 only pair that we could find that like fit me properly and I wasn't like batter anything.
00:11:20 There were a pair of red shoes and they were kind of nice, I guess.
00:11:24 And I sort of offhandedly said, you know, like they're nice, but I don't have anything
00:11:28 reds to go with it because it would kind of be weird to like be dressed in all black
00:11:32 and just suddenly red shoes, it just draws attention too much.
00:11:37 You look like Jade from Homestuck.
00:11:40 I was going to say the Wicked Witch of the West, but same person.
00:11:43 So your mom's interpretation was buy you something red so that you have something to go with
00:11:47 the shoes.
00:11:48 I kind of, I kind of treat the disease, treat the disease, not the symptoms.
00:11:53 I did my own grave though because I did, I did sort of offhandedly said like maybe my
00:11:57 handbag was red or something to match with it.
00:12:00 So because I was thinking like in terms of character design, how to like weigh out the
00:12:05 redness.
00:12:06 So you're something.
00:12:07 You dug your own grave.
00:12:08 Yeah.
00:12:09 Yeah.
00:12:10 I dug my own grave.
00:12:11 It's not that I dislike it or anything.
00:12:12 I prefer my purple one though.
00:12:14 It has more pockets.
00:12:15 More pockets is better.
00:12:17 I have a section for all the little things that I need.
00:12:20 Like there's a section for my keys, there's a section for like handkerchiefs, there's
00:12:24 a section for everything.
00:12:25 Well, this one doesn't have enough sections.
00:12:28 I mean, as a big fan of the Mage cast, I wonder if maybe these will be worn by red mage.
00:12:35 Remember?
00:12:36 Remember there was red mage.
00:12:37 Red and blue mage.
00:12:38 Remember them?
00:12:39 Yeah.
00:12:40 Well, she wasn't red.
00:12:41 Well, she red.
00:12:42 Did I make her red?
00:12:43 I made her red.
00:12:44 Yeah, there was a red one and a blue one.
00:12:45 Oh yeah, okay.
00:12:46 Don't nitpick on the goddamn like fucking, oh no, it's only slightly off on the hexadecimal
00:12:50 value.
00:12:51 Oh no, yeah.
00:12:52 This is actually the red one was magenta and the blue one was technically mauve.
00:12:55 So, you know, don't at me.
00:12:59 I made them past.
00:13:00 Why don't we mauve on from this boring ass topic, shall we?
00:13:05 How about your ass is grass and I'm going to mauve it?
00:13:08 What was that?
00:13:09 What else did you get?
00:13:10 What was your second gift though, Mage?
00:13:13 Then the amount went past post Christmas shopping and she got me a coat because she
00:13:22 insisted my old coat wasn't looking nice and I'm like, but it's fine.
00:13:26 And she was like, Mage, it's 10 years old and I'm like, but it's fine, but she got
00:13:32 me one and it's sort of purplish kind of.
00:13:34 So I'm happy.
00:13:35 Well, this is why you have to you have to ask for something specific for Christmas.
00:13:41 I didn't.
00:13:42 I didn't like, I couldn't add like all the things I want is out of my family's budget.
00:13:47 So I was like, I'd be fine with a new sweater, honestly, because I could use a new sweater.
00:13:52 But yeah, I mean, my mom usually asks me if she has nothing in mind, but if she has her
00:13:58 heart set on something, she'll do it.
00:14:00 So there was really no point if she didn't ask me.
00:14:04 Oh, I want for Christmas is freedom from this damn patriarchy.
00:14:12 That's where I'm at.
00:14:13 I don't want to sound like an ingrate.
00:14:15 I love my mom and she, she did this because she cares for me and I appreciate it.
00:14:21 Of course.
00:14:22 No, she wants me to be warm and she wants me to be comfortable.
00:14:25 A fair bit of bitching about our loved ones is always warranted and that's within Christmas
00:14:31 parameters.
00:14:32 Yeah.
00:14:33 Of course.
00:14:34 Those motherfuckers only spent $400 on me and I wanted something for 600.
00:14:41 You know what?
00:14:42 I think I talked about this the last time I was on, but like you make a deal where like
00:14:46 you talk to them about like, you know, I want that I like, I remember once I wanted a camera
00:14:50 and I'm like, this thing's like 500 bucks, guys, just pay as much as you want.
00:14:53 I'll pay the rest and then we'll just, we'll just work this out.
00:14:56 Uh, they got, they got me the, they, they got me the, they got me the jewel plated tooth
00:15:02 teeth grills that I asked for, but they got them for me in sterling silver when I asked
00:15:07 for gold.
00:15:08 What the fuck?
00:15:09 God damn.
00:15:10 Uh, that reminds me of like, now my teeth won't match my brass knuckles.
00:15:18 Uh, it reminds me like, oh, those posts I see every, every holiday season of when kids
00:15:24 like, like, oh, they got me the wrong colored iPhone or like the wrong colored car and I'm
00:15:29 just like cringing like my iPhone won't match my car.
00:15:35 It's such an expensive gift and they're still ungrateful and it's not like they're sort
00:15:40 of like sighing about it.
00:15:42 They're like mad about it.
00:15:44 Like, yeah.
00:15:45 You know what?
00:15:46 I'm siding with the rich kids on this one because you know what?
00:15:49 You know what?
00:15:50 Those parents are rich enough to just buy whatever the fuck their kids want, but they're not
00:15:54 fucking listening when the kid tells them they want the black one, not the white one.
00:16:01 Maybe they should open up their fucking brain a little bit.
00:16:03 I would be, I would be kind of annoyed if like my parents were insisting on spending
00:16:08 that much money, but we're going to get it wrong in some way.
00:16:11 Yeah.
00:16:12 Right.
00:16:13 There was so much on the line here for you to get right.
00:16:15 Yeah.
00:16:16 How could you fuck this up?
00:16:17 You just spent $900 on the wrong thing.
00:16:20 Like what the fuck were you thinking?
00:16:21 Thanks for ruining Christmas, mom.
00:16:24 Sometimes the color difference is like a very large sum of money of a difference and sometimes
00:16:29 they just don't have just enough for that.
00:16:31 That can be true.
00:16:32 I guess so.
00:16:33 I mean, if there's extenuating circumstances, it's different, but if they just straight up
00:16:36 picked the wrong color, it's like you fumbled at the, at the last yard.
00:16:40 If it was just as easy for them to pick the pink one versus the purple one or whatever
00:16:44 and they picked the wrong one, then what that shows is a lack of giving a shit about the
00:16:49 details of this transaction when they may have meant a lot to the person.
00:16:53 It's like on the Kiki Ghibli cast.
00:16:56 You know, you can side with the old lady, yeah, the old lady, you know, oh, she works
00:17:00 so hard to make this herring and, herring and pumpkin pie or whatever.
00:17:05 But you know.
00:17:06 The girl didn't want it in the first place.
00:17:07 The girl told her she doesn't like that pie.
00:17:10 So why did she make it?
00:17:11 Why did she go to all that trouble if she just listened?
00:17:14 She should have known to just get her, to just get her a fucking gift card to Dunkin'
00:17:18 Donuts instead.
00:17:19 Yeah.
00:17:20 That's a far more thoughtful.
00:17:21 She always says she won.
00:17:22 Yeah, but there has to be a bitch about it.
00:17:23 It's a grandma.
00:17:24 But she is a bitch about it.
00:17:26 Yeah.
00:17:27 That's rude.
00:17:28 Oh.
00:17:29 Well, she wasn't.
00:17:30 Okay.
00:17:31 Well, she wasn't a bitch to the grandma.
00:17:32 She was a bitch to some random delivery girl.
00:17:33 That's also rude.
00:17:34 Don't be a bitch to delivery people.
00:17:36 And she wasn't.
00:17:37 She's just like, oh, I hate this pie.
00:17:39 Yes.
00:17:40 She was rude.
00:17:41 She wasn't that bad.
00:17:42 She was rude.
00:17:43 You know what?
00:17:44 She was rude.
00:17:45 You opened my eyes.
00:17:46 Did you open my eyes to that scene?
00:17:47 I saw.
00:17:48 It's because I'm spoiled as shit so I can relate better to the spoiled characters than
00:17:52 the, like, two days.
00:17:54 Band is not allowed.
00:17:55 Only wholesome things.
00:17:57 Being spoiled is wholesome.
00:17:58 It's wholesome.
00:17:59 It's wholesome.
00:18:00 Kind of.
00:18:01 Being spoiled is wholesome.
00:18:02 Speaking of being spoiled, I was so gratified to log in to teespring.com and see that it
00:18:10 immediately, upon posting the I'm Just Being Cool shirt, a flood, hundreds of thousands,
00:18:18 literally every single one of our viewers bought that shirt.
00:18:21 Yeah.
00:18:22 And yeah.
00:18:23 What shirt?
00:18:26 It's not true, by the way.
00:18:27 This is a fantasy.
00:18:28 This is a Christmas fantasy.
00:18:29 Oh, sorry.
00:18:30 I was confused.
00:18:31 But you can make it real by going to teespring.com, whatever slash whatever, link in the show
00:18:38 notes below or also the main description.
00:18:41 It was the I'm Just Being Cool shirt, which I mean, in last episode I said in the episode
00:18:47 I'm going to make the I'm Just Being Cool shirt and I did.
00:18:50 Now I understand.
00:18:51 And your fantasy.
00:18:52 Okay, I get it.
00:18:53 Okay, I get it.
00:18:54 I love to speed.
00:18:56 I do like it.
00:18:57 A bunch of what I asked for from, yeah, that nice, that tasteful comic sans.
00:19:02 Yeah, that's the good stuff.
00:19:05 Just showing how serious you are about being cool in the, in the, a bunch of the stuff
00:19:11 I asked for for Christmas, because I couldn't think of a lot for my parents to get for me.
00:19:15 And you know, they'll dig, oh, what do we get you?
00:19:18 We got it.
00:19:19 We got to get you stuff.
00:19:20 Mom, just give me cash.
00:19:21 Just send me a check.
00:19:22 No, no.
00:19:23 So I had him get me a bunch of endless war merch from the, from the RFC cake store.
00:19:29 I see.
00:19:30 Yeah.
00:19:31 You had them buy your own merch.
00:19:33 Assumably you get kickback from that too, right?
00:19:36 Yeah.
00:19:37 Yeah.
00:19:38 You're getting them coming and going.
00:19:39 Who made it go?
00:19:40 Well, Munchie gets half.
00:19:41 Munchie gets half.
00:19:42 That's right.
00:19:43 You know, that was also my Christmas present to Munchie was getting my parents to buy a
00:19:47 bunch of RFC cakes.
00:19:48 Cleverly fucking played.
00:19:49 Yeah.
00:19:50 Yeah.
00:19:51 That's not bad.
00:19:52 I mean, you know, I got to, I got, this way I got to splurge.
00:19:55 I got to splurge on the big one.
00:19:56 Next year I'm going to tell everyone to just subscribe to my Patreon for Christmas and hope
00:20:00 most of them forget to unsubscribe before the next month.
00:20:04 You know, it's not a bad idea.
00:20:06 Oh my God.
00:20:07 That reminds me.
00:20:08 I don't know if I should say a name or anything, but I checked my email the other day and someone
00:20:12 whose name I have seen and like comments and I think he's in my discord and stuff, someone
00:20:16 just sent me like a hundred bucks as a Christmas present.
00:20:20 Sweet.
00:20:21 Why not say their name?
00:20:23 Thanks, David Toth.
00:20:25 Appreciate it.
00:20:26 There you go.
00:20:27 Security number 81723, you know, IP address.
00:20:33 I have geo hacked your location to send you a card and I'm going to say it out loud now.
00:20:44 That's sweet.
00:20:45 That's sweet.
00:20:46 Yeah.
00:20:47 I don't know.
00:20:48 I guess on Christmas.
00:20:49 Christmas inclusion.
00:20:50 Did you guys?
00:20:51 Christmas is bad.
00:20:52 No.
00:20:53 Christmas is good because I love to go to the movies on Christmas.
00:20:56 And it's a great time.
00:20:57 What movie did you see on Christmas?
00:20:59 I saw Into the Spider-Verse.
00:21:02 I saw On Christmas Day.
00:21:04 Please don't spoil.
00:21:05 Please don't spoil.
00:21:06 I really want to see it.
00:21:07 Okay.
00:21:08 I won't spoil it.
00:21:09 I'll just tell you it was very good.
00:21:10 I liked it a lot.
00:21:11 Everyone's telling me it's really great and that I should see it.
00:21:12 I haven't seen a single negative opinion about it.
00:21:16 We got to do a little X-Nate on that.
00:21:18 What is it?
00:21:19 Acke, Blay, Erector K.
00:21:21 You know, let's get some more white boys in there.
00:21:23 Other than that though.
00:21:25 Who was it in the PCP?
00:21:27 We were talking about how the movie flopped abroad.
00:21:32 Did it?
00:21:33 Because in China.
00:21:34 Oh, the only white people in China or something, right?
00:21:36 They didn't show miles in any of their advertisements.
00:21:40 Oh, that's fucked up.
00:21:41 Yeah.
00:21:42 The ads in Asia made it seem like Peter was the main character.
00:21:45 Thank you.
00:21:46 Because they didn't think a black person would sell and lo and behold, it didn't.
00:21:49 Well, I guess I aptly played.
00:21:52 Unfortunately, it wasn't enough, I guess.
00:21:55 That's too bad.
00:21:56 Because it's really good.
00:21:58 You should watch it in China and enjoy it.
00:22:00 I highly recommend it.
00:22:01 Go watch it in China.
00:22:03 Yeah, it's China.
00:22:04 I'm not saying it's not great or good.
00:22:06 But, you know, superhero movie.
00:22:10 Spider-Man.
00:22:11 Oh, man.
00:22:12 No, I hear you.
00:22:14 I won't go into detail.
00:22:15 Because I don't want to spoil it for an agency.
00:22:17 I'm not even burnt out on superhero movies because I don't watch them.
00:22:20 I haven't even seen Infinity War.
00:22:23 The last superhero movie I watched was Iron Man 2.
00:22:28 This movie?
00:22:29 Okay.
00:22:30 So, I'll just say it in general.
00:22:32 Or maybe the first Captain America.
00:22:33 Into the Spider-Verse was really good.
00:22:35 But Infinity War was way more interesting conceptually.
00:22:40 Although, this spider shit was the best looking movie I've ever fucking seen.
00:22:44 So, it's got that going for it.
00:22:47 But everything about Thanos was just way more interesting.
00:22:50 I'll remember more.
00:22:52 Whereas, I mean, this was about another hero becoming a hero.
00:22:56 Doing hero things.
00:22:58 I've seen it.
00:23:00 I get it.
00:23:01 So, when I call this one of the best things I've ever seen,
00:23:05 like some people were saying, absolutely not.
00:23:07 Infinity War kind of was.
00:23:09 So, that wins on that front.
00:23:11 Yeah.
00:23:12 I don't know.
00:23:13 Everyone should see it anyway though because it just looks so fucking good.
00:23:16 And Kingpin.
00:23:17 Oh, my God.
00:23:18 Kingpin's design is so sick.
00:23:19 He's just the biggest man I've ever seen with his little head.
00:23:23 It's so sick.
00:23:25 I know it's not original.
00:23:27 But man, should you like Spider-Gwen's design a whole lot?
00:23:32 It is sublime.
00:23:33 I was gonna ask if Spider-Gwen was in there because it seems like he was.
00:23:37 I saw her in a trailer.
00:23:38 She's so cute.
00:23:39 I like the colors.
00:23:40 Spider-Gwen's so cool.
00:23:41 Yeah.
00:23:42 Colors are great.
00:23:43 I mean, I love her costume and all.
00:23:44 I don't know if I like that her like buzzed undercut hair thing.
00:23:48 It's just not really the hairstyle.
00:23:50 I'm into that.
00:23:51 Me and Michelle saw it at the same time.
00:23:53 And a slight point on that was just that we both commented,
00:23:57 as we finished and were walking out,
00:23:59 they sure did that whole Gwen's better than all the boys thing.
00:24:02 So that was cool, I guess.
00:24:04 Was she the Lola Bunny of the film?
00:24:07 Well, only slightly.
00:24:09 She wasn't sexualized or anything to that degree.
00:24:13 But whatever.
00:24:14 That was only at the beginning.
00:24:15 Anyway, everyone should go see it.
00:24:16 I guess that's just the short version.
00:24:18 So you heard it here, everyone.
00:24:21 Into the Spider-Verse is a feminist propaganda nightmare
00:24:25 that you should all avoid.
00:24:27 It's intersectional, too.
00:24:28 Absolutely.
00:24:29 I don't even know what that means.
00:24:30 I mean, Miles was great.
00:24:31 Miles ruled.
00:24:32 I don't know.
00:24:33 I kind of liked the atmosphere and the music around Miles more than him as a character.
00:24:38 Because, like, I don't know.
00:24:39 He was just a kid who, like, he did it, and he did the battle, and he won.
00:24:43 He did it.
00:24:44 So, you know, cool and all.
00:24:46 But I've seen it a lot.
00:24:47 Yeah, good job.
00:24:48 Good on you.
00:24:49 All right.
00:24:52 All right, look at all these fucking Marvel movies.
00:24:54 Jesus Christ.
00:24:56 I haven't seen one of these things in like three years.
00:24:59 He's like, you know, Harry Potter was the boy who lived.
00:25:02 Miles is the boy who did it.
00:25:04 The boy who did it.
00:25:05 He really done did it.
00:25:07 Also, you know what?
00:25:08 Why the fuck does Miles get extra spider powers that Spider-Man doesn't have?
00:25:12 What the hell is that about?
00:25:13 Why can he fucking turn invisible and Spider-Man can't?
00:25:16 Why?
00:25:17 He got bit by the same fucking spider.
00:25:19 What the hell is the deal?
00:25:20 Turn invisible?
00:25:21 Yeah.
00:25:22 And he has weird electroshock powers.
00:25:24 Why?
00:25:25 It's not necessarily the same spider, right?
00:25:27 I was going to say, was it literally the same spider?
00:25:30 It looked the same.
00:25:31 I guess I just assumed.
00:25:32 Okay, if it's not, then fair enough.
00:25:33 You don't fucking know.
00:25:34 All right.
00:25:35 Okay, enough.
00:25:36 You didn't get your master's degree in spider-onomy like I did.
00:25:39 That's fair.
00:25:40 What's that made?
00:25:41 It's something probably no one has ever heard, or at least not many people.
00:25:44 It's not a movie.
00:25:45 It's a TV series that I sort of binge-watched the first season of.
00:25:49 It's called Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.
00:25:52 I've heard of it.
00:25:53 I've never seen it.
00:25:54 I read the books, actually.
00:25:55 Oh, okay.
00:25:56 I've been wanting to watch that show because it was directed by Max Landis.
00:26:00 Oh, shit.
00:26:01 What a good movie.
00:26:02 He's a YouTuber.
00:26:03 Isn't he getting me-tued now?
00:26:05 Did he get me-tued?
00:26:06 I mean, he's been getting me-tued his whole career, I think, or something.
00:26:09 Only a little bit, and it didn't stick, or something like that.
00:26:13 I don't know.
00:26:14 Maybe there's more to it.
00:26:15 No, he's just done a bunch of videos about how he just gets accused of really random shit.
00:26:20 There's lots of rumors and weird stuff about him because he talked shit about the girl from Star Wars,
00:26:25 and now everybody thinks he's an anti-feminist or something.
00:26:28 Oh, yeah.
00:26:29 I remember that.
00:26:30 Oh, Mage.
00:26:31 I don't know if you know this, but Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is a series of books
00:26:37 by the guy-
00:26:38 Who made the-
00:26:39 by Douglas Adams.
00:26:40 Yeah, yeah.
00:26:41 Oh, I didn't know that.
00:26:42 Yeah, the guy who did-which is why I read them.
00:26:44 I didn't know there was a show.
00:26:46 Well, there's two seasons.
00:26:48 I think they cancelled after the two seasons.
00:26:51 As my friend-because I heard this from my friend, and my friend said,
00:26:55 Oh, they cancelled it because they wanted to invest into a different series,
00:26:59 despite the fact that Dirk Gently was doing well, but not well enough,
00:27:02 and they thought the other series would do better, but it kind of really flopped, so.
00:27:07 Yeah.
00:27:09 Which is a shame.
00:27:10 I really liked it.
00:27:11 It was so weird, but like, I like that kind of weird, and it's-
00:27:16 I couldn't-I couldn't figure it out.
00:27:18 Up until the very end, I couldn't figure everything out,
00:27:20 but like, it all came together and it's very wacky, and I like it.
00:27:24 So I-so I loved Hitchhiker's Guide as a kid.
00:27:28 To be honest, I don't remember that much about Dirk Gently.
00:27:32 The one thing I think-I think I remember about Dirk Gently,
00:27:36 or it might have been from like, his final book of like, unfinished stories
00:27:41 that might have included some Dirk Gently, like, sample chapters, was like,
00:27:45 a guy, like, a character in one of the stories is a literal rain god,
00:27:51 but he doesn't know that he's a rain god.
00:27:53 Cool.
00:27:54 And so it's always raining wherever he goes, and he hates-and he hates the rain.
00:27:58 It's like, cause it-it follows him everywhere, and he doesn't know why,
00:28:01 and he's really depressed about it.
00:28:03 Um, yeah.
00:28:05 That's unfortunate.
00:28:06 I think-I think Jesse-I think Jesse designed a pony OC at one point,
00:28:11 that we were gonna-we were maybe talking about doing like, an ask blog,
00:28:15 and it was like-
00:28:16 I sort of remember, I think.
00:28:17 He was like a black pony with like, a rain cloud cutie mark,
00:28:21 and his whole thing was the rain.
00:28:23 And I remember, I was-I drew him for Jesse,
00:28:26 and I was thinking about this guy from the Dirk Gently story, this-this, uh,
00:28:31 this rain dude.
00:28:33 I don't remember-man, was that-was that OC's name?
00:28:35 Oh!
00:28:36 It really liked him.
00:28:37 Uh, Rainy Parade?
00:28:38 Was that-
00:28:39 Yeah, Rainy Parade. Yeah, that's it.
00:28:40 Yeah, I remember that now.
00:28:41 Yeah.
00:28:43 Um, do not steal.
00:28:46 We're gonna monetize that one yet.
00:28:49 Uh, we gotta put that on a PCP shirt.
00:28:51 Yeah, I really like the actor for Dirk Gently.
00:28:55 He just-he-he's really good at the whole being whimsical and innocent sort of guy,
00:29:01 and then when he cries, he just looks so-so convincingly sad,
00:29:05 like, innocently sad, and just so feel bad for him.
00:29:09 He's a really good actor already.
00:29:11 Was-was-is that a new series, or how old is it?
00:29:15 It's only from, like, a year and a half ago, two years ago.
00:29:18 What?
00:29:19 This is why Max Landis hasn't been doing YouTube videos,
00:29:21 is because he went to work on that show.
00:29:23 Oh.
00:29:24 No shit.
00:29:25 Yeah.
00:29:26 Which I'm wondering, what did the fuck-
00:29:28 Well, blow me down.
00:29:29 Now that the show's canceled.
00:29:31 Uh, getting me-tuned, you know.
00:29:33 Yeah.
00:29:34 It's just, uh, that's his full-time job.
00:29:36 Hey guys, just got back from a hard day of getting me-tuned.
00:29:39 It's time for a little Q&A.
00:29:41 I think we either ended, like, at the beginning of this year,
00:29:44 or at the ending of last year, so we'll turn this.
00:29:46 Uh, when are we all gonna get me-tuned?
00:29:48 When is my turn?
00:29:50 Um...
00:29:51 When do-when do me, too, get what is coming to me?
00:29:55 You know?
00:29:56 I want my turn.
00:29:57 Are you saying that, like, the dad joke way?
00:29:59 That, like, uh, uh, I want some of that me-too.
00:30:01 Like, how about me-too, get over here,
00:30:03 big, hip, waitress at my local pub?
00:30:06 Uh, no.
00:30:08 No, okay.
00:30:09 It's not what I meant, I just meant when is each of us
00:30:11 going to have our sexual misconduct come to light?
00:30:14 I mean, reveal just the sick people that we are.
00:30:17 Taken for granted that there is misconduct.
00:30:20 It's only a question of when.
00:30:21 Look, none of us-I can't believe none of us are deplatformed yet.
00:30:25 None of us have, like, a riot following us around at all times.
00:30:29 Like, where's our-
00:30:30 We're probably doing something wrong.
00:30:32 What about me?
00:30:33 What about me?
00:30:34 What about me?
00:30:35 Like...
00:30:36 Did she-
00:30:37 Yeah?
00:30:38 Never mind.
00:30:39 Never mind.
00:30:40 Not to give-not to give anyone ideas.
00:30:42 We're probably doing something wrong.
00:30:44 Yeah.
00:30:45 Uh, if-that we don't have that.
00:30:46 We're gonna have to go-
00:30:47 Well, yeah, I-I was just gonna say,
00:30:48 not to give anyone ideas, but I sincerely believe
00:30:51 you just need to create, like, a shitstorm,
00:30:55 whether-where-where there-like,
00:30:57 people just assume where there's smoke, there's fire.
00:30:59 So if a lot of people just mass-report,
00:31:01 like, you could absolutely organize a campaign
00:31:04 to just report the PCP.
00:31:06 For, like, the joke I made before,
00:31:08 uh, about, like, you know, not liking Black Spider-Man
00:31:11 is more than enough to get this whole fucking show shut down.
00:31:15 If people just choose to make an issue of it.
00:31:17 But can we not, though?
00:31:18 Can we just-
00:31:19 But-but-but all-mage, all they have to do
00:31:21 is be like, well, these guys have said
00:31:23 the N-word on this podcast before.
00:31:24 Oh, my God.
00:31:25 Can you believe?
00:31:26 There's a pattern emerging here.
00:31:27 There's a pattern of behavior.
00:31:29 I know.
00:31:30 I know.
00:31:31 And your guys are giving me anxiety
00:31:32 every time you make an off-color joke.
00:31:34 So if we get kicked off the platform,
00:31:36 then our fucking Patreon will spike.
00:31:39 Well, that's true, for a time.
00:31:40 We need this drama.
00:31:41 No publicity is bad publicity.
00:31:43 I've been saying it for years.
00:31:45 Yeah.
00:31:46 That we need to start beef.
00:31:47 We need to start beef.
00:31:48 Look, everybody-
00:31:49 I've had an ostrich and hide my head.
00:31:50 Everybody likes to-
00:31:51 I just don't actually do that, but-
00:31:53 Look, everybody likes having the comfort
00:31:55 of not having controversy surrounding you.
00:31:58 However, you've got to leave your comfort zone
00:32:00 if you want to accomplish anything in this world.
00:32:02 You know?
00:32:03 You get what you want just by sitting around waiting.
00:32:05 I still don't believe the drama is necessarily
00:32:08 the way to do that, but-
00:32:09 Drama is something to talk about.
00:32:11 And you've got to have people talking about you
00:32:14 for whatever one reason or another.
00:32:16 That's true.
00:32:17 I can steal my art.
00:32:18 Thank you very much.
00:32:19 I don't want more drama.
00:32:20 Fair enough.
00:32:21 Fair enough.
00:32:22 Hey, here's an interesting concept.
00:32:24 You know what?
00:32:25 Okay, I'll say it because I already brought it up,
00:32:27 but it's just a small thing.
00:32:28 I put in my Goblin Slayer video that came out
00:32:31 a week ago or whatever.
00:32:33 I put what I thought was official art
00:32:35 because I recognized this picture of guts.
00:32:37 I was talking about guts.
00:32:39 And then, as it turned out,
00:32:41 it was actually not official art.
00:32:43 What it was was-
00:32:44 Like, a guy messages me,
00:32:46 and I've added this to the description, so it's fixed.
00:32:48 But what he said was,
00:32:50 hey, that's actually my art.
00:32:52 You please credit me.
00:32:54 And I was like, oh, sorry.
00:32:55 I thought it was official.
00:32:56 Turns out what it was was-
00:32:57 it looks like a tracing.
00:32:59 It's not a tracing.
00:33:00 It is a, according to this guy,
00:33:02 it's a hand-drawn recreation
00:33:04 from not traced,
00:33:06 but recreated elsewhere
00:33:08 in a slightly different art style.
00:33:10 You know what I'm talking about?
00:33:12 Another episode where we were talking about this,
00:33:14 we were looking at some fan art.
00:33:16 That's right.
00:33:17 It was not traced,
00:33:19 but it was basically perfect duplication.
00:33:21 No, we weren't sure if it was traced or not
00:33:24 because it looked identical,
00:33:25 except it was drawn on different medium,
00:33:27 but the guy could have easily printed it off
00:33:29 and traced it.
00:33:30 They said that it wasn't traced.
00:33:33 And I believe that,
00:33:35 yeah, well, maybe you didn't literally-
00:33:37 maybe you did just copy it by eye,
00:33:39 but still you just copied it.
00:33:41 I had my doubts, but yeah.
00:33:42 That's what this guy said.
00:33:44 I got no problem with this guy.
00:33:45 It's perfectly fine if he wants to do that and shit.
00:33:47 It just makes the crediting process interesting.
00:33:50 So he recreated an official piece.
00:33:53 It's volume one cover of Berserk.
00:33:55 It's like a picture of guts.
00:33:57 I have a little bit less of a problem with that.
00:33:59 I don't know where my morals lay.
00:34:01 Don't ask me, don't add me.
00:34:03 Well, did he reinterpret it?
00:34:05 Did he reinterpret it?
00:34:06 No, it was pretty much a one-for-one recreation.
00:34:09 It wasn't a different art style.
00:34:11 I don't understand defensiveness over your work
00:34:15 if it's like that.
00:34:16 And any of these people,
00:34:17 I mean, we've talked about this before,
00:34:19 I will link for credit for people
00:34:21 just so that they'll shut the fuck up,
00:34:23 but I don't think you deserve it
00:34:25 if you're just making fan content.
00:34:27 Like, it's not your fucking content.
00:34:29 No, I don't know.
00:34:30 Don't own the IP.
00:34:31 No, I think you deserve it first.
00:34:32 I think you deserve it first.
00:34:33 My fan art that I draw,
00:34:34 I'm a bit more lenient when people use it
00:34:36 because it is fan art for a different thing that exists
00:34:39 so long as they don't claim it that they drew it.
00:34:42 But look at this.
00:34:43 I'm posting this in the gross disgusting audio links.
00:34:45 Look at this picture of Zelda that somebody fucking did.
00:34:48 She never did this pose in the game.
00:34:51 This is a new thing that somebody made
00:34:53 based on a character.
00:34:54 Yeah.
00:34:55 How could you say this person doesn't deserve?
00:34:57 Fan work deserves its own credit.
00:34:59 If I throw this picture randomly into a video,
00:35:03 it would be no different from me throwing
00:35:05 gameplay footage of the game randomly into the video.
00:35:07 And I don't credit Nintendo in the description.
00:35:10 Like, you know, I don't see...
00:35:12 I don't understand how these people themselves
00:35:14 don't understand the paradox that's going on there.
00:35:17 They don't look at that and say like,
00:35:19 I don't own Zelda, you know.
00:35:22 Guys, my opinion might change this or shift
00:35:25 or it depends on the context or whatever.
00:35:27 But like, the way I see it, like,
00:35:29 if the image is a big part of your video,
00:35:31 you should probably credit it.
00:35:33 But if it's just like there for a few seconds,
00:35:36 and you know, you're using a lot of images
00:35:38 and it's not like a centerpiece or anything...
00:35:40 Like, it could have been any other picture of Zelda.
00:35:43 Yeah.
00:35:44 I do think if you're going to base your whole video around it,
00:35:47 then yeah, you're doing something very tasteless.
00:35:50 You definitely deserve to be called out on it, you know.
00:35:53 But like, yeah, if it's just like something that's just there
00:35:55 and like you said, could have been any picture,
00:35:57 then it's like, again, I will give credit if they ask
00:36:00 just because, you know, whatever.
00:36:02 I'll support the artists, you know.
00:36:04 Because I know that's what they really want.
00:36:06 I know that's what's...
00:36:07 What is upsetting to them is they're like,
00:36:09 you know, I drew this piece
00:36:11 not that many people have seen it,
00:36:13 but you've put it in this video that has tens of thousands of views.
00:36:17 This is probably the most that anyone's going to see it
00:36:19 and they don't even know that it's me who made it.
00:36:21 And I understand the frustration
00:36:23 because like I have a...
00:36:25 One of my fans made an AMV
00:36:27 with the anime Kase-san and Morning Glory
00:36:30 set to one of my songs.
00:36:32 And that AMV somehow, some way,
00:36:35 has like 150,000 views,
00:36:37 which is way more than any of my music,
00:36:40 probably combined,
00:36:42 and they didn't link to me at all in the description.
00:36:45 That's pretty fucked up, guys.
00:36:47 Yeah, that's bad.
00:36:49 I'm looking at it and I'm like,
00:36:51 well, I'm not mad.
00:36:53 I'm just like, this is such a huge missed opportunity for me.
00:36:56 They probably didn't even know better.
00:36:58 No, they didn't, because she was literally like 14.
00:37:00 Yeah, there you go.
00:37:02 But you know, I was just kind of like,
00:37:04 how could you not credit me when you know it?
00:37:06 It would be such a huge help to me.
00:37:08 I mean, in that case,
00:37:10 if it's an AMV,
00:37:12 the music is like core to this.
00:37:14 It's foundational, absolutely.
00:37:16 Yeah.
00:37:18 I was trying to say though,
00:37:20 if an artist does come up and be like,
00:37:22 hey, could you at least credit me?
00:37:24 I think it's just, you know,
00:37:26 common matters to just credit them if you,
00:37:28 you know, you did actually use their art.
00:37:30 You know what I've noticed though?
00:37:32 This has long confounded me.
00:37:34 I like PewDiePie, he's a good guy.
00:37:36 I've noticed he will credit things in videos.
00:37:38 Now we're getting deep platforms.
00:37:40 Yeah, it's over, we're fighting the king now.
00:37:42 It's just that I notice, I have a different stance.
00:37:44 I didn't credit tons of the stuff
00:37:46 that goes into his videos.
00:37:48 I have noticed this.
00:37:50 And like, yes, it's legal.
00:37:52 I feel like it's just like kind of rude.
00:37:54 Like, it's fair to be like,
00:37:56 just throw some fucking links in the description, dog.
00:37:58 I mean, he must have an editor, right?
00:38:00 Yeah, he's got a team of editors.
00:38:02 He's got a team of editors to put his videos together.
00:38:04 Yeah, I mean, he's got at least two editors,
00:38:06 and I think like they, on rotation,
00:38:08 they just like are given an edit,
00:38:10 like a video of like two edit and stuff.
00:38:12 They should be part of their job, I would think.
00:38:14 I just think, you know,
00:38:16 like, okay, to share PewDiePie
00:38:18 is like a really big, popular guy,
00:38:20 and like just getting your image in there
00:38:22 is good and all that.
00:38:24 But still though, like,
00:38:26 people have gotten mad at me,
00:38:28 and I think it's warranted when I use their stuff
00:38:30 and just don't credit them if I'm using it for something.
00:38:32 And so now I've adopted a policy where I do.
00:38:34 And when I just see like the big boys
00:38:36 not doing that, I just think the same,
00:38:38 you know, credit system should apply.
00:38:40 Maybe they just need a poke,
00:38:42 but it's kind of hard to poke someone that big
00:38:44 and out of reach, you know what I mean?
00:38:46 Like, I mean, because I'm getting notifications
00:38:48 from people saying like, hey, would you mind
00:38:50 crediting me, but I never see this stuff
00:38:52 like being added or updated,
00:38:54 I mean, I haven't done an exhaustive fucking search or anything.
00:38:56 Like to his discretion, is it just that,
00:38:58 I wonder if there's a layer of protection
00:39:00 that people accept that like this guy's so big
00:39:02 and probably gets so many pings
00:39:04 he can't possibly address any of them
00:39:06 and like worry about
00:39:08 crediting people.
00:39:10 I don't know.
00:39:12 I think probably people are asking him for credit
00:39:14 and just not getting a response.
00:39:16 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
00:39:18 But like, is it an appropriate defense
00:39:20 that he just gets so many messages
00:39:22 that it's not his responsibility?
00:39:24 I mean, he's committing so many crimes
00:39:26 he can't possibly correct them all.
00:39:28 I mean, it's a small thing.
00:39:30 Yeah, I think in that case, it literally is just like,
00:39:32 I mean, it just goes to show you
00:39:34 how little it really matters to anybody
00:39:36 that like it matters to that artist.
00:39:38 It's not going to help them pay your fucking bills.
00:39:40 Yeah, I mean, it's just like not something
00:39:42 that most people are worried about
00:39:44 or something that's going to affect the creator
00:39:46 if they don't credit you.
00:39:48 It's not like they're going to get a fucking huge backlash
00:39:50 unless they've like really
00:39:52 egregiously stolen something
00:39:54 and like that is the basis of their content
00:39:56 that they're putting.
00:39:58 I guess a moral thing,
00:40:00 I just want people
00:40:02 who helped me make a video
00:40:04 producing something,
00:40:06 they just deserve something in return.
00:40:08 That's all I guess.
00:40:10 And I guess just being in a video,
00:40:12 sure, that's nice in itself.
00:40:14 And if you're PewDiePie getting your thing in there,
00:40:16 that's great, but I don't know.
00:40:18 I'd like to see more.
00:40:20 I'd like to see a little bit more here.
00:40:22 You fucking get PewDiePie
00:40:24 to throw your fucking
00:40:26 Gumball Rule 34
00:40:28 shit up on screen
00:40:30 for two seconds and you're made
00:40:32 for thousands, you're set for life.
00:40:34 I mean, I guess what I would do
00:40:36 The man just shits gold.
00:40:38 The man's like Tyrion Lannister.
00:40:40 I guess what I would do is what everybody else does
00:40:42 and tweets out the video
00:40:44 and say like, I'm in this video
00:40:46 because it's a PewDiePie video and gets millions of views.
00:40:48 So that's pretty cool.
00:40:50 You get a little boost.
00:40:52 You get a nice boost from that.
00:40:54 Yeah, I guess that's true.
00:40:56 Alright, whatever. It's fine. Not a big deal.
00:40:58 God, I wish I could be in a PewDiePie video.
00:41:00 But you know what? My friends
00:41:02 Monkey's been in there, you know?
00:41:04 That's true.
00:41:06 My boy, well for bad reasons
00:41:08 but my boy AFY
00:41:10 had his dancing
00:41:12 lolly-titty
00:41:14 dancing crab meme video
00:41:16 showcased in a fucking PewDiePie video.
00:41:18 Dancing lolly-titty
00:41:20 Yeah, that's what it is.
00:41:22 Bizarre story.
00:41:26 I don't think this doesn't
00:41:28 know what to make of it. I guess it's just a weird coincidence
00:41:30 or something.
00:41:32 So there's this
00:41:34 fucking lefty
00:41:36 ass
00:41:38 blue pill
00:41:40 who is my hero
00:41:42 is
00:41:44 a YouTuber
00:41:46 called Jack St
00:41:48 or Lacking St.
00:41:50 Do you just like him because of the name?
00:41:52 That's why I clicked on him
00:41:54 originally.
00:41:56 So he
00:41:58 made a video
00:42:00 maybe a couple months ago
00:42:02 called The Story of Ascentar
00:42:04 a neo-liberal horror story
00:42:06 and in it he relates
00:42:08 a news story
00:42:10 or he goes into the story of how
00:42:12 an internet company
00:42:14 their equipment was faulty
00:42:16 and it started creating a
00:42:18 loud wine, a high-pitched wine
00:42:20 and people in the neighborhood
00:42:22 started tweeting about it and stuff
00:42:24 and people didn't
00:42:26 take it seriously
00:42:28 thought they were complaining
00:42:30 but it went on for weeks and weeks
00:42:32 and it created a high-stress environment
00:42:34 and ultimately there was
00:42:36 a violent incident
00:42:38 someone pulled out a gun
00:42:40 and tried to shoot out the transformer
00:42:42 that was producing the noise
00:42:44 and someone thought he was being shot at
00:42:46 and pulled out a gun and shot back
00:42:48 and someone got killed
00:42:50 so anyway
00:42:52 that's a crazy story
00:42:54 and meanwhile
00:42:56 the rich fat cats running the internet provider
00:42:58 just sit back and do nothing
00:43:00 they barely even apologize for the incident
00:43:02 shame on them
00:43:04 so a new video comes out by this guy
00:43:06 and he explains that in fact
00:43:08 this was a work of fiction
00:43:10 that he had written
00:43:12 but delivered sort of as fact
00:43:14 there were some hints in it that it was not true
00:43:16 but I had not picked up on them
00:43:18 I had thought this was a real thing that happened
00:43:20 kind of like real information might be
00:43:22 and he
00:43:24 compared it to like
00:43:26 Orson Welles war of the worlds
00:43:28 type of like
00:43:30 like a documentary style
00:43:32 like a work of fiction delivered
00:43:34 like a documentary as though it were true events
00:43:36 whatever the point is
00:43:38 that in that video
00:43:40 he goes to google
00:43:42 it should have been pretty clear
00:43:44 to anyone who wanted to know more
00:43:46 that this was not a real event because there's no
00:43:48 google search results about it
00:43:50 and he goes on youtube and google search
00:43:52 is like a sentar incident
00:43:54 and to demonstrate
00:43:56 that there are no results however
00:43:58 one of the top
00:44:00 results from that search
00:44:02 is a thumbnail of like one of
00:44:04 mumkey's videos
00:44:06 like one of the last videos that he posted
00:44:08 and I was like I pause the video and I was like wait is that
00:44:10 why would that come up
00:44:12 in that search?
00:44:14 a sento I mean it's possible
00:44:16 it's recommended for this guy who's making the video
00:44:18 that he's just a fan and that happens to be
00:44:20 maybe
00:44:22 but is it the search results though right?
00:44:24 yeah
00:44:26 you wouldn't think that does that
00:44:28 no
00:44:30 yeah I don't know
00:44:32 that was weird
00:44:34 oh thanks for the show notes
00:44:36 showing visually demonstrating how
00:44:38 brown is n-word backwards
00:44:40 yeah no problem well that's to remind me to get the image
00:44:42 to link it
00:44:44 to breaking
00:44:46 right
00:44:48 but that's a good video
00:44:50 the ascentar video by Jackson
00:44:52 is pretty good
00:44:54 kind of like it less now that I know it's not real
00:44:56 yeah it made me question everything
00:44:58 I mean is there something
00:45:00 slightly unethical about doing that
00:45:02 telling a story and presenting it as fact
00:45:04 I mean I feel a little
00:45:06 I feel a little bit embarrassed
00:45:08 trying to be like oh you know I was lied to
00:45:10 because like I feel a little bit like
00:45:12 I don't want to point out that the emperor has no clothes
00:45:14 because I'll be revealed
00:45:16 as the rube that I am that I was tricked
00:45:18 but I don't know
00:45:20 I'm a pretty canny viewer of media
00:45:22 I went into this video
00:45:24 feeling like I had no reason
00:45:26 not to assume
00:45:28 that the facts being related to me were true
00:45:30 mm-hmm
00:45:32 uh
00:45:34 kind of reminds me of the whole marble hornet thing
00:45:36 though you kind of knew it was not true
00:45:38 but they were very dedicated
00:45:40 well
00:45:42 I mean I wasn't I wasn't around
00:45:44 when marble hornets was new
00:45:46 but I assume that no one was really watching
00:45:48 marble hornets until
00:45:50 it became clear that it was
00:45:52 a slender man thing
00:45:54 and by that point it probably should have been clear that no
00:45:56 this is not real
00:45:58 that's right
00:46:00 that's my assumption I don't even know what fucking marble hornets is
00:46:02 they've explained to me like ten times I still don't understand
00:46:04 it's the slender man
00:46:06 video
00:46:08 I don't know
00:46:10 what's happening
00:46:12 what's a video on youtube
00:46:14 what is youtube
00:46:16 we need to start in round zero
00:46:18 where is web 2.0
00:46:20 um
00:46:22 I get all my youtube videos through
00:46:24 a youtube amalgamation website
00:46:26 where I never need to touch youtube
00:46:28 they're just fed directly into my brain
00:46:30 how about a web 4.0 now
00:46:32 how about a web 2.0
00:46:34 how about a web 2.0
00:46:36 how about a web 4.0 now
00:46:38 I need a fucking jewel
00:46:40 I need a fucking jewel after all this
00:46:42 I need to calm my nerves
00:46:44 I only watch the
00:46:46 current top video on all of reddit
00:46:48 it is the only content
00:46:50 I will consume
00:46:52 you know what would be a fascinating video
00:46:54 an analysis of the top content
00:46:56 on I guess all of reddit
00:46:58 like overtime if such a thing can be tracked
00:47:02 or I guess just like on youtube
00:47:04 or wherever just like whatever was
00:47:06 the most mass appeal
00:47:08 thing it was that history of dance video
00:47:10 fuck you know what I think I've seen some of this
00:47:12 actually and I think about it
00:47:14 I was thinking
00:47:16 I don't remember what
00:47:18 prompted me to think about this
00:47:20 but I was thinking about like
00:47:22 youtube subscriber inflation
00:47:24 and like
00:47:26 you know how in like
00:47:28 2005 or whatever
00:47:30 having tens of thousands
00:47:32 of subscribers was like you know
00:47:34 was a big deal and you could be like
00:47:36 the front page of youtube for that
00:47:38 I was wondering like
00:47:40 if you could take like who were
00:47:42 the top subscribe channels in those days
00:47:44 and like take that number
00:47:46 divide it into the subscribers of
00:47:48 the top subscribe channel today
00:47:50 would you arrive at like a rough
00:47:52 sort of you know
00:47:54 inflation rate or a rough sort of
00:47:56 conversion rate for like
00:47:58 subscribers in 2018
00:48:00 how many subscribers would that be
00:48:02 roughly equivalent to in you know
00:48:04 2005 or whatever
00:48:06 it's gotta be a huge difference I mean
00:48:08 I don't know what that'd be but
00:48:10 I remember I've seen I've seen some
00:48:12 infographics of like you know the top
00:48:14 the top youtube channel and like how
00:48:16 they've all you know
00:48:18 grown how the numbers have gone up
00:48:20 and up and up and they've all like you know
00:48:22 zigged and zagged and surpassed
00:48:24 each other and back again like h
00:48:26 no not h3h3 less
00:48:28 equals 3 equals 3 was was top
00:48:30 for a while
00:48:32 I've never even heard of that
00:48:34 never heard of equals 3
00:48:36 I remember him
00:48:38 oh god
00:48:40 nostalgia
00:48:42 I did not I did not I did not watch him
00:48:44 back in the day I didn't know who he was until
00:48:46 relatively
00:48:48 I remember when people were just
00:48:50 the
00:48:52 squirrel aids was funny apparently I never
00:48:54 found it funny but it was just
00:48:56 a joke
00:48:58 I did see some of his
00:49:00 you know music videos
00:49:02 I didn't know who they were
00:49:04 your mom
00:49:06 yeah I had I had seen
00:49:08 stalking your mom years and years ago
00:49:10 never knowing it had anything to do with
00:49:12 this ray william johnson I think the
00:49:14 general was titled doing your mom but then
00:49:16 they made it you know they remade it
00:49:18 they remade it I think
00:49:20 I mean in ray william
00:49:22 justin I think the end
00:49:24 or something like they had
00:49:26 a bit of a theme song that it was called
00:49:28 doing your mom but I'm not sure if it was by
00:49:30 them or anything so is that guy just not
00:49:32 around anymore what happened
00:49:34 what happened to ray william johnson
00:49:36 because I remember people complaining about him all the time
00:49:38 he was the guy who actually think I
00:49:40 that same guy that that jack saint guy
00:49:42 did a video about
00:49:44 ray william johnson I heard
00:49:46 wasn't he the dude who just like
00:49:48 just talk about what was popular on youtube
00:49:50 yeah he talked about memes
00:49:52 he would he would just like
00:49:54 show videos that were
00:49:56 popular on youtube and say
00:49:58 yeah that's true that was it
00:50:00 that was really funny
00:50:02 he was like he was like America's funniest
00:50:04 home videos but for youtube
00:50:06 I see that there is a channel
00:50:08 called simply ray that has
00:50:10 9.8 million subscribers that he
00:50:12 uploaded to one day ago
00:50:14 and oh there was a 5 month
00:50:16 gap here but I guess he uploads
00:50:18 things here I don't know
00:50:20 I think he sort of passed on his
00:50:22 equals 3 channel to someone
00:50:24 and that didn't do so
00:50:26 yeah he quit it he quit it
00:50:28 yeah it was
00:50:30 it was jack saint that's why
00:50:32 I was thinking about ray william johnson
00:50:34 he did a video about that and he still
00:50:36 uploads but like you know
00:50:38 or no wait maybe it was
00:50:40 maybe it was a quintin reviews maybe it was a fallen
00:50:42 titan quintin you know what that's what it was
00:50:44 it was a quintin reviews oh is that that one
00:50:46 that's the bearded dude right
00:50:48 yes that guy's pretty good
00:50:50 I only watched like one or two of his videos
00:50:52 but they were pretty good you know he's alright
00:50:54 I've watched a bunch of his stuff
00:50:56 it's pretty it's pretty deice
00:50:58 I've been seeing a lot of like negative
00:51:00 sentiments I was gonna say
00:51:02 I've been seeing a lot of people saying that he
00:51:04 he's an asshole for various reasons lately
00:51:06 I'm not sure why well it seems like
00:51:08 I don't trust what anybody says
00:51:10 people say I'm an asshole constantly and
00:51:12 they're probably right but I don't believe it anyway
00:51:14 I don't know I don't know what
00:51:16 it is but something I feel like he's made
00:51:18 people mad I I don't know how can't
00:51:20 I haven't watched any of his stuff but I
00:51:22 feel that he's a trump
00:51:24 hate man that people think is a little bit
00:51:26 over the top is anyone not a trump
00:51:28 hate man
00:51:30 orange man bad
00:51:32 orange man bad
00:51:34 orange man bad
00:51:38 that was a
00:51:40 yeah that was a god that was another there was
00:51:42 jack saint did a video on the NPC
00:51:44 meme and
00:51:46 talking about orange man bad
00:51:48 that's how I know about
00:51:50 orange man bad
00:51:52 I've never heard that before
00:51:54 I'm surprised
00:51:56 it's kind of a meme by now
00:51:58 it's pretty funny
00:52:00 I saw a good counter post I saw a tweet or something
00:52:02 there's a picture of someone posted the NPC
00:52:04 orange man bad and then someone
00:52:06 posted a pet posted back a
00:52:08 pepe with the NPC face
00:52:10 saying orange man good so you see
00:52:12 the knife cuts both ways
00:52:14 oh no
00:52:16 now that we've unleashed the monster
00:52:18 he'll slaughter us all both sides
00:52:20 well
00:52:22 all man bad
00:52:24 oh no
00:52:26 hey guys to sort of
00:52:28 change the subject and maybe
00:52:30 wrap it back to the holiday season
00:52:32 it's not new years yet
00:52:34 it is going to be when people are
00:52:36 you know after new years when people are
00:52:38 going to listen to it but what are your
00:52:40 new year
00:52:42 plans any resolutions
00:52:44 whatever
00:52:46 I don't really do resolutions
00:52:48 you know
00:52:50 I mean
00:52:52 I'm getting
00:52:54 I have lately been getting back to
00:52:56 drawing the vapors finally
00:52:58 so I guess my resolution is to
00:53:00 continue that
00:53:02 I'm sure you'll appreciate this
00:53:04 Nate but my new years resolution
00:53:06 for next year is to
00:53:08 just kick ass all year
00:53:10 excellent
00:53:12 normally
00:53:14 I have a more concrete goal
00:53:16 last year it was to make $100,000
00:53:18 I don't think I did accomplish that
00:53:20 but
00:53:22 ordinarily I would just make it the
00:53:24 same goal again shoot for the moon
00:53:26 Digi even if you miss you still
00:53:28 land among the stars
00:53:30 I think that what I really
00:53:32 want next year is not so much about
00:53:34 how much money I make but how much
00:53:36 progress I make
00:53:38 if you're just fixated
00:53:40 on like multiplying how much
00:53:42 money you make in a linear way
00:53:44 there's no sense of build up
00:53:46 an investment for like being able
00:53:48 to make more in the future
00:53:50 it's not so much about
00:53:52 that I want in the next year to get
00:53:54 to a point where I'm making $100,000
00:53:56 as it is to have set
00:53:58 everything up that I can
00:54:00 you know move
00:54:02 even faster going forward
00:54:04 this is too vague to be good radio
00:54:06 talk but you know what I'm talking about
00:54:08 I get the general idea
00:54:10 my general commitment
00:54:12 goal whatever
00:54:14 it's really just to buckle down
00:54:16 I was really hoping
00:54:18 to get this ghost in the shell video
00:54:20 I've been working on out
00:54:22 before the end of the year that did not happen
00:54:24 so just I want to get all my commitments
00:54:26 out of the way this year
00:54:28 which essentially is
00:54:30 there's a little bit of rad con stuff left
00:54:32 I mean this honestly that's too small
00:54:34 of a goal for the whole year because it's going to be done fairly quickly
00:54:36 but I have really cleared
00:54:38 the field and I'm not going to be taking
00:54:40 on any more burdens and like
00:54:42 I've got my first we Agua out now that I'm back on them
00:54:44 I'm really trying to stick to a schedule
00:54:46 of at least every other week or so
00:54:48 and using that opposite week
00:54:50 to like get other stuff done and I know
00:54:52 I say it a lot but frankly the finances are looking
00:54:54 good and I creep ever closer
00:54:56 towards this being
00:54:58 released from the day job thing so
00:55:00 we'll see
00:55:02 when are you coming to fucking Boston
00:55:04 we were talking about
00:55:06 I got to check the dates I think we were planning
00:55:08 people there's a little inside baseball we were planning
00:55:10 to get together sometime
00:55:12 in the next couple of weeks I think around the 13th
00:55:14 if I remember correctly
00:55:16 and do some planning for
00:55:18 PCP stuff and communal projects
00:55:20 and do some workshop
00:55:22 I need there's a lot that needs to be
00:55:24 discussed about the possibilities
00:55:26 and requirements
00:55:28 that we will have to meet
00:55:30 in order to be able to fucking
00:55:32 make PCPHQ real
00:55:34 yep and those are substantial
00:55:36 and we need a solid plan so yeah
00:55:38 yeah I'm down
00:55:40 I've been listening to what you've been saying in our
00:55:42 private things and yeah
00:55:44 that's right audience we're out here
00:55:46 making plans we're out here moving
00:55:48 moving money around
00:55:50 moving and shaking
00:55:52 shaking and bacon and taking
00:55:54 lots of big
00:55:56 hits on the bong
00:55:58 for inspiration
00:56:00 if only
00:56:02 Ben I might need you to
00:56:04 didn't you say that you knew a guy who could get me weed
00:56:06 don't
00:56:08 don't say it
00:56:10 don't say it on the podcast
00:56:12 don't let them know
00:56:14 the Christians will know
00:56:16 don't let them know
00:56:18 well now they know
00:56:20 let it go let it go
00:56:22 it's cold outside
00:56:24 nobody else smokes but weed
00:56:26 is literally legal now here in Boston
00:56:28 or in Massachusetts
00:56:30 you can literally just go buy it and it's too fucking expensive
00:56:32 I thought
00:56:34 it's literally
00:56:36 420 an ounce
00:56:38 straight up
00:56:40 they did it
00:56:42 $420 an ounce
00:56:44 oh I thought you meant $4.20
00:56:46 I was like that's not so bad
00:56:48 that reminds me I think recently in Canada
00:56:50 or at least Vancouver
00:56:52 legalized weed and stuff
00:56:54 and when I visited Canada
00:56:56 it smelled
00:56:58 everywhere
00:57:00 that's fucking great
00:57:02 I was told that they don't have
00:57:04 any sort of official
00:57:06 places they sell
00:57:08 so they're still buying it from illegal places
00:57:10 despite it being legalized
00:57:12 so it's kind of a weird situation
00:57:14 to be in I guess
00:57:16 did I ever tell you
00:57:18 when I was in Amsterdam
00:57:20 you smoke weed
00:57:22 I don't really smoke weed
00:57:24 in Amsterdam you smoke weed that is what you do
00:57:26 so I was like
00:57:28 I guess I should smoke some weed
00:57:30 so I got some weed
00:57:32 they have bars
00:57:34 you can just go into a bar
00:57:36 and buy a joint at the bar
00:57:38 nice
00:57:40 so I got one and I went outside
00:57:42 and I was walking around smoking it
00:57:44 and people were like you can't smoke that outside
00:57:46 and I was like what the fuck man
00:57:48 when I went to Japan
00:57:50 I turned 21 but the drink age there
00:57:52 is 20 so I could drink before
00:57:54 in Japan, in Tokyo at least
00:57:56 you can just drink on the street
00:57:58 you can just walk wherever you want
00:58:00 in America you can't fucking do that
00:58:02 in Europe you can
00:58:04 buy a beer and walk home
00:58:06 drinking your beer
00:58:08 you can't do it anywhere in America
00:58:10 nowhere in America can you do that as far as I know
00:58:12 the best they got
00:58:14 is some restaurants
00:58:16 they might have
00:58:18 an outdoor
00:58:20 that's pretty common
00:58:22 what the fuck man
00:58:24 but yeah
00:58:26 Digi
00:58:28 I live with a bunch of guys that smoke weed
00:58:30 one guy
00:58:32 the guy
00:58:34 I won't say his name
00:58:36 it doesn't matter
00:58:38 I asked him where he got his
00:58:40 and he was like oh my friends sell it
00:58:42 but they're not looking to deal
00:58:44 with buyers or anything so that was a bust
00:58:46 but then a new guy moved in
00:58:48 and I asked him if he had a hookup
00:58:50 and he said yeah so I was like
00:58:52 yeah new guy
00:58:54 yeah new guy
00:58:56 I'm not sure what the prices are out on the streets
00:58:58 currently but it's gotta be cheaper than
00:59:00 the fucking official shit
00:59:02 I am shocked by that price
00:59:04 he didn't quote me
00:59:06 he wouldn't quote me like a specific price
00:59:08 but I'm sure it's less than what you're paying
00:59:10 is it bureaucracy and government overhead
00:59:12 that made the price so high
00:59:14 it's just straight taxes
00:59:16 it's just like a 20% fucking tax
00:59:18 because that's what tax included
00:59:20 it's 4.29
00:59:22 so like when we did Radcom 3
00:59:24 Kickstarter we went to 9001
00:59:26 for the meme
00:59:28 and that was a
00:59:30 complete joke
00:59:32 but we were doing it
00:59:34 we reached it
00:59:36 so that's all cool
00:59:38 what degree they went up to
00:59:40 versus what it would have been
00:59:42 if not just for the meme
00:59:44 apparently in all the places that they've
00:59:46 legalized weed
00:59:48 the prices always start off really high
00:59:50 and then they quickly go down
00:59:52 over the course of the first year or two
00:59:54 because of the fact that
00:59:56 it just shouldn't cost that much
00:59:58 and more people can afford it
01:00:00 so the places that are selling it right now
01:00:02 are all very high end
01:00:04 fancy places
01:00:06 they're all former medical dispensaries
01:00:08 we need a place for gutter sluts
01:00:10 such as ourselves
01:00:12 the proletariat needs weed
01:00:14 more than the rich do
01:00:16 yeah they got their zany anyway
01:00:18 exactly
01:00:20 give them their fucking
01:00:22 I smell benes
01:00:24 wait
01:00:26 what is the connection with
01:00:28 I'm very familiar with that meme
01:00:30 and I love it and quote it all the time
01:00:32 but what's the connection here
01:00:34 aren't benes benedral
01:00:36 which is a fucking meme
01:00:38 that I've
01:00:40 I thought the meme was I smell benes
01:00:42 the guy says
01:00:44 I finally got all these benes
01:00:46 maybe it was like
01:00:48 it's gotta be benzos
01:00:50 whatever that's short for
01:00:52 that's an actual drug
01:00:54 does anyone take benedral to get high
01:00:56 they might
01:00:58 isn't that what benzos are as well
01:01:00 you know it could be
01:01:02 and I wouldn't know
01:01:04 we need to know people
01:01:06 hey what do you say we do the voicemails
01:01:08 now how about
01:01:10 I mean we've only been going for an hour
01:01:12 yeah I mean I don't know
01:01:14 that's true
01:01:16 I'm happy to take you guys
01:01:18 have anything else you want to talk about that's fine with me
01:01:20 I mean like the voicemails
01:01:22 depending on what we're asked
01:01:24 or presented
01:01:26 you could also ask up to an hour who knows
01:01:28 yeah that's true
01:01:30 yeah okay let's do a voicemail
01:01:32 here's our first one
01:01:34 apparently it's a slang term for the drug
01:01:36 benzadrine
01:01:38 benzos
01:01:40 I guess it's all the same shit
01:01:42 I'm looking at something right now
01:01:44 do you guys know that endless war
01:01:46 has territory control now
01:01:48 I've heard about this haven't looked into it but I'm aware
01:01:50 have you seen the new map
01:01:52 no I haven't
01:01:54 I'm just gonna post a link to the map
01:01:56 which is dynamic and which now like updates itself
01:01:58 to show like what
01:02:00 it's so I'm looking at it right now
01:02:02 and I just can't I'm just it's
01:02:04 it's crack fucking did it
01:02:06 we the team the team did it
01:02:08 pulled together looks exactly like it always
01:02:10 looked in my head
01:02:12 this is
01:02:14 cause this is where Nate posted
01:02:16 this is where we put the links
01:02:18 so that the people who are editing
01:02:20 can easily just use them
01:02:22 once they're it's time to edit
01:02:24 it makes it real easy for everybody
01:02:26 okay fine
01:02:28 the fucking the juvie's control
01:02:30 cratersville what the hell is that about
01:02:32 no no that's green is neutral
01:02:34 okay okay well this looks dope
01:02:36 I see the killers are dominating that's excellent
01:02:38 it
01:02:40 it moves pretty fast
01:02:42 the killers are I think the killers
01:02:44 have a stronger strategic position
01:02:46 cop kill town but
01:02:48 to help that we're gonna
01:02:50 we're gonna put in a ferry we're gonna add a ferry
01:02:52 from cratersville to
01:02:54 assault flat speech resort
01:02:56 and as well
01:03:02 just break it down for me real quick
01:03:04 what is the general way the territory
01:03:06 is passed because I've been wondering
01:03:08 how does one control an area
01:03:10 you know once you could explain it better
01:03:12 because I was working on slimoids while he
01:03:14 and right and
01:03:16 and and be and we were
01:03:18 not do we don't think
01:03:20 mostly Munchie and lateralist
01:03:22 were most I think mostly lateralist
01:03:24 honestly we're working on territory control
01:03:26 so I don't know the ins and outs of it but I believe
01:03:28 mm-hmm the gist of it
01:03:30 is that you just have to go to
01:03:32 a place and just basically be
01:03:34 there you just have to spend time in a zone
01:03:36 okay and while you're there
01:03:38 you will be uncapturing it from the other
01:03:40 team making it neutral and then you will
01:03:42 start capturing I see for your only other
01:03:44 question what are the benefits of having
01:03:46 captured a zone I
01:03:48 believe right now the only benefit
01:03:50 is that they pass passively
01:03:52 generate slime for your kingpin
01:03:54 okay cool cool yeah
01:03:56 so they're forgetting your team ahead
01:03:58 I want to play slime rancher now
01:04:00 slime rancher is sick
01:04:02 I wish so bad that
01:04:04 slime rancher had multiple same
01:04:06 same so much I got I got my boyfriend
01:04:08 slime rancher for Christmas among other games
01:04:10 and I just I really wish we could play together
01:04:12 yeah
01:04:14 I would man
01:04:16 and what if we had like a team what if the three
01:04:18 of us what if I'm just beginning I'm just
01:04:20 going to third wheel really hard
01:04:22 and do like a team deathmatch
01:04:24 a slime rancher that would just be
01:04:26 great all right
01:04:28 let's do it here we go to voicemails
01:04:30 here it is people
01:04:32 you've been waiting for it and here it is the first
01:04:34 voicemail of the call
01:04:36 of the recording from Doopity
01:04:38 Schmoople of the year that's
01:04:40 the first one of the year doopity
01:04:42 you've done it here you go
01:04:44 begin
01:04:46 by the time you hear this
01:04:48 it will have been a week since the
01:04:50 conquering of the I am game server
01:04:52 the men have been killed
01:04:54 the women
01:04:56 also killed
01:04:58 the children have played
01:05:00 to the juvie's rose mine
01:05:02 and tom oliver admitting we have
01:05:04 passion, dedication
01:05:06 and excitement they can only dream of
01:05:08 with this overwhelming victory
01:05:10 we
01:05:12 the people of new los angeles city
01:05:14 aka neil no walkie
01:05:16 ask this question
01:05:18 to anyone who dares
01:05:20 pull a stunt like this again
01:05:22 are you ready
01:05:24 for the eternal violence
01:05:26 the forever conflict
01:05:28 the infinite bloodshed
01:05:30 the groundless struggle
01:05:32 I ask you
01:05:34 are you ready
01:05:36 for the endless war
01:05:38 I don't know if you guys are aware
01:05:40 but there has been official war
01:05:42 declared the only reason
01:05:44 the only reason that the
01:05:46 endless war people were able to
01:05:48 even have a foothold in the I am game
01:05:50 servers because tom foolishly
01:05:52 declared war while his co-leader
01:05:54 was completely away on vacation
01:05:56 and I had
01:05:58 no ability to help
01:06:00 in any way to
01:06:02 raise the armaments
01:06:04 and the defenses
01:06:06 and to retaliate
01:06:08 I'm just saying the next battle
01:06:10 might not go so smoothly
01:06:12 I think that the
01:06:14 endless war crowd
01:06:16 was pretty well
01:06:18 mentally primed for this
01:06:20 I think maybe we'd been
01:06:22 without even intending to
01:06:24 kind of indoctrinating them
01:06:26 for this eventuality
01:06:28 for the waging of war
01:06:30 in a discord server
01:06:32 they might have had some practice
01:06:34 that kind of thing
01:06:36 might be like the whole conceit
01:06:38 that's just a theory
01:06:40 a game theory
01:06:42 there's a
01:06:44 my boys
01:06:46 in the pod de escort
01:06:48 have also on record gone on
01:06:50 and declared war on all other
01:06:52 servers and
01:06:54 you know what
01:06:56 I gotta throw this in
01:06:58 there was something produced and while we're on the
01:07:00 subject of the war going on between all the
01:07:02 servers
01:07:04 I gotta throw this in
01:07:06 I'll play the next call and we'll get back to that
01:07:08 I just want doopity
01:07:10 I wish you had mentioned
01:07:12 if they had
01:07:14 rescued paradox crocs from the mud
01:07:16 knights in the mud puddle
01:07:18 there's still no
01:07:20 update on that
01:07:22 I forgot about the mud puddle
01:07:24 the mud versus slime war rages on
01:07:26 as I understand it
01:07:28 presumably
01:07:30 I can't see that ending
01:07:32 that's like an Israel Palestine
01:07:34 there's no understanding
01:07:36 you know what
01:07:38 everybody listen up
01:07:40 this is the pod de declaration
01:07:42 of war
01:07:44 let's play it for all to hear

01:09:24 I didn't even know there was a pody cast discord
01:09:26 but of course there is
01:09:28 I think I heard about it
01:09:30 and they just fucking
01:09:32 afy and centerpoint got everybody on the server
01:09:34 together and they all fucking recorded it
01:09:36 everyone knows now
01:09:38 about the pody
01:09:40 she just got real
01:09:42 my discord is not participating in the war
01:09:44 that's some bullshit mage
01:09:46 it's not participating in the war
01:09:48 Switzerland ass over there
01:09:50 I'm not telling anyone to do anything
01:09:52 sincerely
01:09:54 but I'm just saying
01:09:56 you ever heard of a little country called Poland
01:09:58 mmhmm
01:10:00 you ever heard of a little thing called world war 2
01:10:02 I also heard about switzerland
01:10:04 never heard of it
01:10:06 little thing called blitzkrieg
01:10:08 little thing called crystal knocked
01:10:10 just giving you some ideas ladies and gentlemen
01:10:12 no war is allowed
01:10:14 we win
01:10:16 it's over we already won this one
01:10:18 it's gonna be so tragic
01:10:20 what will definitely happen to you
01:10:22 alright I'm mourning you already
01:10:24 I made you just said
01:10:26 you're sitting it out god damn
01:10:28 you can't have it both ways you can't be like
01:10:30 oh if I was fighting guys I would
01:10:32 I said I like how you said you already won
01:10:34 even though I'm not even playing
01:10:36 that's sad
01:10:38 what the hell am I supposed to do
01:10:40 you took yourself out of it
01:10:42 the only winning move is not to play
01:10:44 unless you're poland in world war 2
01:10:46 like you are
01:10:48 poland
01:10:50 the fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter
01:10:52 whether or not mage wants
01:10:54 to be participating in the war
01:10:56 when a war comes to your doorstep
01:10:58 when the fuck are you gonna do
01:11:00 we're gonna delete your damn discord mage
01:11:02 we're taking it out
01:11:04 maybe we need to ratify
01:11:06 maybe we need to ratify like our own Geneva convention
01:11:08 or something
01:11:10 for the rules
01:11:12 the rules of ethical warfare
01:11:14 the Geneva convention was only established after world war 2
01:11:16 I think though
01:11:18 we'll just have to wait for mage to become a casualty
01:11:20 and then we can look back on it
01:11:22 with
01:11:24 better understanding
01:11:26 yeah but you got lots of natural resources
01:11:28 that I'm gonna need to mine
01:11:30 I'm gonna need to take those
01:11:32 we're seizing those
01:11:34 you're like um

01:13:08 when everyone else is dead
01:13:10 that's how

01:16:24 a little bit of the Ava

01:18:02 responsible for like the iconography
01:18:04 of my channel
01:18:06 many times over over the years
01:18:08 I mean when he asked me
01:18:10 he just said like essentially
01:18:12 you know I'm quote unquote his boss
01:18:14 in the PCB not really we all know that but like
01:18:16 effectively it sort of works that way
01:18:18 so he just thought that like I'd be a guy who could
01:18:20 detail his strengths
01:18:22 you know as like a member of our little group here
01:18:24 so you know
01:18:26 plus I've commissioned him a bunch and he's always been good so
01:18:28 you know
01:18:30 speaking of commissions my commissions are always open
01:18:32 oh yeah always
01:18:34 yeah that's cool
01:18:36 until I stayed in other ways
01:18:38 munchie got uh munchie announced
01:18:40 he announced open commissions recently
01:18:42 and apparently he got flooded
01:18:44 yeah and actually uh
01:18:46 he told me what he was charging though
01:18:48 and I was like that's pretty low
01:18:50 balls I think that's kind of the reason that I
01:18:52 that I had been saying that like it was surprising
01:18:54 to me that he wanted to go
01:18:56 to school is that he can work so
01:18:58 fucking fast that like yeah he can do
01:19:00 commissions that are like 15 bucks and he'll
01:19:02 jam you out of picture in like half an hour that you're
01:19:04 completely satisfied with you know
01:19:06 so 15 bucks for half an hour of work is
01:19:08 extremely fucking good you know that's true
01:19:10 I mean
01:19:12 I don't think commissions is that
01:19:14 like he's got higher aspirates unless
01:19:16 you're like really famous and
01:19:18 personally I just hate doing commissions
01:19:20 I think munchie is less anti
01:19:22 I hate drawing commissions
01:19:24 munchie seems to like doing it
01:19:26 I used to not like doing commissions
01:19:28 but in recent times
01:19:30 I've been quite enjoying doing commissions
01:19:32 well that's cool hit me
01:19:34 I basically only do them when someone offers
01:19:36 to pay me what I would consider
01:19:38 to be more than what they're worth
01:19:40 by a significant like
01:19:42 the only price
01:19:44 that I think is worth me doing a commission
01:19:46 is something that I am totally not
01:19:48 comfortable asking for
01:19:50 yeah I'll tell you right now
01:19:52 that yesterday I filmed
01:19:54 all of these 27 rants
01:19:56 that I've been spamming everybody's sub box with today
01:19:58 those are
01:20:00 $15 a month tier on
01:20:02 Patreon I have like 50
01:20:04 people on that tier only like half of them actually
01:20:06 gave a rant
01:20:08 that they wanted to give
01:20:10 and of those you know I did it all
01:20:12 in a day so like whatever
01:20:14 that's not bad pay for one fucking day
01:20:16 right exactly so
01:20:18 you know in that sense
01:20:20 those were commissioned videos basically
01:20:22 and as long as the people are satisfied with them
01:20:24 which I have not gotten any response from anybody
01:20:26 who actually commissioned them
01:20:28 so far but
01:20:30 you know if that continues to work out
01:20:32 I would consider myself to be someone
01:20:34 with commissions open
01:20:36 in that case
01:20:38 you know I don't know
01:20:40 when else I'd have a chance to say it I guess I could say it anytime
01:20:42 but I might as well say it now
01:20:44 so yeah I have a lot of people
01:20:46 that have qualified for
01:20:48 like reward art from my Patreon
01:20:50 that have never contacted me about it
01:20:52 I have sent out some
01:20:54 I did send out emails at some point
01:20:56 to a lot of people being like hey
01:20:58 you qualified for reward art
01:21:00 and you know a lot of people didn't get back to me
01:21:02 they probably weren't pledging for reward
01:21:04 they just wanted to support me which is cool
01:21:06 but I don't know if you're listening to this
01:21:08 and maybe you are a patron
01:21:10 and you do want one
01:21:12 like if I haven't already emailed you
01:21:14 about it send me a message or something
01:21:16 because like you know I want
01:21:18 you know I want people to get
01:21:20 what they're paying for
01:21:22 yeah that's fair
01:21:24 at some point I feel like I kind of lost track of that
01:21:26 like I haven't had anyone be like
01:21:28 hey you didn't give me the thing
01:21:30 wait no there was one guy
01:21:32 but then I gave him the things it was alright
01:21:34 yeah

01:22:04 mails are on you
01:22:06 please please
01:22:08 for the love of god don't start
01:22:10 vaping
01:22:12 it's not just bad for your health
01:22:14 it's not a big problem
01:22:16 vaping is gonna turn you gay
01:22:18 you don't believe me
01:22:20 just look at the prime example
01:22:22 band saint
01:22:24 so if you remember
01:22:26 patient zero
01:22:28 cause it's gonna turn you gay
01:22:30 but I'm already gay
01:22:32 yeah I was gonna say
01:22:34 oh yeah
01:22:36 it's too late for me but the rest of you
01:22:38 can all learn from this man's wisdom
01:22:40 I've learned
01:22:42 it's Vincent
01:22:44 is he gay
01:22:46 is your ya boi
01:22:48 ya g boi
01:22:50 ooh should I spoil
01:22:52 should I spoil the comic
01:22:56 no he's not gay
01:22:58 you know I haven't seen his rating system
01:23:00 canonically I don't remember seeing
01:23:02 his rating system
01:23:04 did it apply to men
01:23:06 did that do men as well
01:23:08 he does
01:23:10 yeah he does rate men
01:23:12 possibly on different criteria though of course
01:23:14 yeah it's not
01:23:16 spelled out or anything
01:23:18 at least yeah the things
01:23:20 it doesn't say
01:23:22 what it is that he's looking at
01:23:24 but in my head I knew what it was
01:23:26 that he was evaluating about them
01:23:28 he evaluates them on different criteria
01:23:30 um
01:23:32 bye then
01:23:34 sorry
01:23:36 looking at men
01:23:38 is one of the gayest things you can do
01:23:40 and he did it a lot in that one chapter
01:23:42 a bunch several men
01:23:44 remember how that guy hit on him
01:23:46 when he was sitting on the trash can
01:23:48 he didn't hit on him
01:23:50 that guy wasn't hitting on him
01:23:52 that guy was trolling him hard
01:23:54 I know I know I'm just fucking fun
01:23:56 although that man bun
01:23:58 is very metrosexual
01:24:00 I'll say
01:24:02 I saw a lot of man buns in Hawaii
01:24:04 incidentally
01:24:06 I've been thinking about going for the man bun
01:24:08 it's
01:24:10 my hair is long enough
01:24:12 it's almost long enough
01:24:14 I think man buns really
01:24:16 you gotta be ripped to wear a man bun
01:24:18 or like if you're fat that's one thing I guess
01:24:20 you gotta be a big boy to pull off a man bun
01:24:22 in my humble opinion
01:24:24 yeah it's not a look forever
01:24:26 it's definitely not a look for me
01:24:28 so that's not what I just said
01:24:30 total fabrication
01:24:32 just like jack saint tricking me
01:24:34 with the story of a centaur
01:24:36 the neoliberal horror story
01:24:38 indeed
01:24:40 kinsheen slayer
01:24:42 whatever go
01:24:44 yo pcp how likely do y'all think it is
01:24:46 that Sora is gonna be the next smash DLC
01:24:48 to be announced
01:24:50 since it'll be the absolute best time on january 25th
01:24:52 alongside the release of kingdom march 3
01:24:54 also this question is
01:24:56 the entire pcp
01:24:58 not just the guys on this episode
01:25:00 and I'm not gonna make any promises
01:25:02 but if you had a realistic warp sword
01:25:04 what would it be and how would someone mail it to you
01:25:06 axes and shit aren't allowed
01:25:08 I can't make those strong enough out of pvc
01:25:10 if you're in the rfck
01:25:12 discord you can just ping or dm me
01:25:14 my nickname is sword man
01:25:16 is he offering to make us
01:25:18 swords to fight with
01:25:20 in a pcp video
01:25:22 he's just putting it out there
01:25:24 but he makes them
01:25:26 I got a p.o. box dog check any we a go episode
01:25:28 there's a link to that p.o. box
01:25:30 I want a zvi hander
01:25:32 I don't have a p.o. box
01:25:34 that'd be cool
01:25:36 shit I got that video of you swinging that zvi hander
01:25:38 around at the fair I never uploaded it
01:25:40 didn't you tweet it
01:25:42 no I never did
01:25:44 I meant to
01:25:46 I'm just saying I know this is too much
01:25:48 but the only sword thing that's cool
01:25:50 is the absolutely retarded
01:25:52 keyblade that's made of
01:25:54 two swords crossed over
01:25:56 like a fucking keyblade
01:25:58 it looks embarrassing and terrible
01:26:00 no wait it's two keyblade
01:26:02 it's two keyblades
01:26:04 crossed over a sword to make
01:26:06 the keyblade yeah okay there you go
01:26:08 um
01:26:10 first of all is kingdom hearts coming
01:26:12 to the switch I think it is
01:26:14 let me double check right
01:26:16 fucking now if it is then I literally would not
01:26:18 even be surprised if uh if Sora came
01:26:20 to the game kingdom hearts 3
01:26:22 switch let's find out right now
01:26:24 I think it is
01:26:26 um not
01:26:28 not considering switch version until after
01:26:30 something something well that was in 2017
01:26:32 it it won't
01:26:34 if it's not on the switch then no
01:26:36 if it's coming to the switch then maybe
01:26:38 definitely okay I'm seeing things like in October
01:26:40 saying that it maybe
01:26:42 could maybe could square enix really
01:26:44 wants it to I'm not seeing any
01:26:46 confirmation but looks like
01:26:48 people are talking oh my god dude
01:26:50 square enix and Nintendo
01:26:52 together again you know what that could
01:26:54 mean Mario RPG 2
01:26:56 it's time it's time
01:26:58 Mario RPG 2 none of this paper Mario
01:27:00 shit hey you know okay I think
01:27:02 Sora is a super likely and frankly
01:27:04 a great choice for for Smash Bros
01:27:06 in my humble opinion but
01:27:08 but I wonder if Disney
01:27:10 is gonna be an obstacle in that
01:27:12 cause Disney owned Sora
01:27:14 and I wonder
01:27:16 if that's gonna complicate things
01:27:18 Square Enix doesn't own him? I don't think so
01:27:20 I'm pretty sure Disney owned Sora
01:27:22 damn
01:27:24 I don't know I'm just saying that could be an issue
01:27:26 I hope it happens though I think he's a
01:27:28 really think he's a fantastic choice
01:27:30 he would be really cool he'd be really cool
01:27:32 oh they could have like a Twilight Town stage or something
01:27:34 he'd be the one like human character
01:27:36 that I would consider
01:27:38 well I guess I'd play Rosalina
01:27:40 so never mind take back everything
01:27:42 yeah and I guess he would be
01:27:44 sort of an anime sword boy
01:27:46 but he's got tons of magic there's a lot of cool stuff
01:27:48 you could do with Sora he's got tons of fucking abilities
01:27:50 it's okay
01:27:52 it's okay that he's an anime sword boy
01:27:54 I would overlook that character flaw
01:27:56 thank god
01:28:00 okay my LARP sword
01:28:02 well I have
01:28:04 you know
01:28:06 what do I like in swords I like
01:28:08 flamborges but
01:28:10 I'm not I'm not married to flamborges
01:28:12 I like S stock actually I really like S stocks
01:28:14 I don't know if that would even work
01:28:16 as a LARP sword
01:28:18 I'm imagining like a sword with like a black blade
01:28:20 and like a black hilt and like white trim
01:28:22 and like maybe the pommel has my like
01:28:24 saint heart logo on it
01:28:26 those are both like a like a rapier adjacent
01:28:28 right
01:28:30 an S stock is basically a rapier
01:28:32 flamborges is like
01:28:34 it's a broad sword but it has like the wavy blade
01:28:36 only reason I know
01:28:38 is because of soul caliber
01:28:40 well yeah
01:28:42 I know from like dark souls and various like
01:28:44 final fancies and shit where you get these weapons
01:28:46 and fuck I'm imagining I'm imagining
01:28:48 a black blade black
01:28:50 everything white trim with the saint heart
01:28:52 like the saint heart pommel
01:28:54 yeah
01:28:56 other than that
01:28:58 I'm not picky I don't know wink
01:29:00 give me a make a keyblade that has sunglasses
01:29:02 as the keychain it'll be my key
01:29:04 blade haha got them
01:29:06 don't make a key
01:29:08 swordman don't lower yourself
01:29:10 to making key blades
01:29:12 what'd you say mage
01:29:14 chakrams are just round swords
01:29:16 yeah chakrams suck
01:29:18 they're just frizz
01:29:20 what even are they like the first time I ever saw them
01:29:22 was fucking axel and kingdom hearts and shit
01:29:24 like what the hell do those even do
01:29:26 how would those be functional in combat
01:29:28 if you use them with magic
01:29:30 and make them float
01:29:32 and you put them on fire
01:29:34 amaranth and final fantasy 9 uses them right
01:29:36 I don't know
01:29:38 I'm pretty sure
01:29:40 I imagine that the appeal is that
01:29:42 you could just kind of spin around with them
01:29:44 and cut shit
01:29:46 don't you just throw them like frizzbees
01:29:48 I really thought you just threw them like frizzbees
01:29:50 the first time I saw them was in kingdoms
01:29:52 of amalur
01:29:54 freckling or something
01:29:56 and like the way they battled with the chakrams
01:29:58 looked really cool and I was just like
01:30:00 and you make them float and you put them on fire
01:30:02 and they just whoosh and wham
01:30:04 and it's just so cool I love it
01:30:06 that's when you have like a drone
01:30:08 carrying your fucking chakram around
01:30:10 I guess it could do more damage
01:30:12 other than that
01:30:14 I mean in real life I really doubt that they are
01:30:16 very useful or whatever
01:30:18 I guess they're just projectile weapons you just fucking throw them
01:30:20 and they come back like a boomerang
01:30:22 like a very deadly boomerang
01:30:24 I don't think I want that to come back though
01:30:26 like how are you going to catch that thing
01:30:28 magic
01:30:30 alright let's keep going we got two more questions here
01:30:32 or calls or whatever
01:30:34 here's one from doodlebee
01:30:36 play
01:30:38 go
01:30:40 hello PCP
01:30:42 what I want to know is
01:30:44 why does everybody on this podcast
01:30:46 speak with the same
01:30:48 damn tone
01:30:50 even people in these
01:30:52 voicemails they all speak with the same tone
01:30:54 I'm doing it now
01:30:56 and
01:30:58 thank you
01:31:00 have you placed on everybody
01:31:02 thank you and
01:31:04 good day
01:31:06 it's just called having a good radio voice
01:31:08 it's like you naturally
01:31:10 it's sort of like
01:31:12 you try to project your voice
01:31:14 more than normal because
01:31:16 like you're
01:31:18 you want it to just come through as clearly and understandably
01:31:20 as possible I mean like normally
01:31:22 people like
01:31:24 if we were say acting
01:31:26 your top priority isn't necessarily
01:31:28 how clearly you speak
01:31:30 it's how emotively you speak
01:31:32 but if everyone is just emphasizing clarity
01:31:34 everyone's emphasizing
01:31:36 being understood as perfectly as possible
01:31:38 then we're all going to be speaking very clearly
01:31:40 in the same tone
01:31:42 that's true
01:31:44 I guess just the energy here
01:31:46 people kind of just sync up
01:31:48 when they're talking you kind of go to
01:31:50 somebody's fucking vibe or something
01:31:52 yeah I don't know some combination of that shit
01:31:54 you know that's the thing
01:31:56 like you start to talk like the people
01:31:58 you spend time around
01:32:00 your combination of like the six people
01:32:02 that you spend the most time with
01:32:04 I think our voicemails have undergone a really cool evolution
01:32:06 because early on it was very much like
01:32:08 in the exact style of like
01:32:10 biggest problem or dick show voicemails
01:32:12 where it's just kind of people calling in with like a rage
01:32:14 you know and everybody just has this intense
01:32:16 like I'm randin' about whatever
01:32:18 but now it's like way more like a
01:32:20 creative experiment
01:32:22 that's my favorite thing
01:32:24 it's great
01:32:26 I'm so glad we ditched the questions
01:32:28 me too
01:32:30 the voicemails are amazing
01:32:32 they're better than the show
01:32:34 and speaking of voicemails
01:32:36 we've got one final
01:32:38 strong contender
01:32:40 bringing up the rear it's a voicemail
01:32:42 from the legendary dumbass mcdumbfuck
01:32:44 let's see what he's got for us
01:32:48 alright bring us home boy let's go
01:32:50 alright so I'm a content man
01:32:52 I'm a content boy I want to make stuff
01:32:54 and I make stuff
01:32:56 the problem is I haven't made anything
01:32:58 so uh
01:33:00 can you tell me the first thing
01:33:02 I should make
01:33:04 should I draw a thing
01:33:06 should I music a thing
01:33:08 should I go to things
01:33:10 and literally any option is okay
01:33:12 other than it doesn't matter what option I pick
01:33:14 so fuck you
01:33:16 he really lived up to his name with this question
01:33:18 he really did
01:33:20 I'm thinking you make me a sword
01:33:22 I'm thinking like a black blade
01:33:24 like a black pommel like white trim
01:33:26 with a saint heart on the pommel
01:33:28 just express yourself to the exact parameters
01:33:30 Ben specifies
01:33:32 just take a shit and take a picture of it
01:33:34 and uh put it in a frame
01:33:36 everyone's gotta start somewhere
01:33:38 just fucking you know what you wanted
01:33:40 if you're listening just fucking do a let's play dude
01:33:42 just don't be a pussy
01:33:44 just do a let's play
01:33:46 just record yourself talking about something
01:33:48 and put it on me
01:33:50 Ben and I started just with
01:33:52 we saw other people doing it
01:33:54 so we literally just did what seemed popular
01:33:56 can't emphasize enough
01:33:58 how much you don't have to like each other
01:34:00 in fact it might even be better if you hate each other
01:34:02 could be
01:34:04 Ben and I just were like hey we talk about this thing
01:34:06 let's just record it
01:34:08 and then we did so just fucking do that
01:34:10 or I mean this guy is not even married
01:34:12 to like you two or anything
01:34:14 he literally just wants to know what to do
01:34:16 just tell him what you would want
01:34:18 over the last year or two
01:34:20 people in the hellfire hamlet
01:34:22 a bunch of like podcasts
01:34:24 a bunch of people make podcasts together now
01:34:26 it's cool
01:34:28 here's what I most want
01:34:30 so just create this
01:34:32 because it is what I want
01:34:34 is just make
01:34:36 like YouTube videos
01:34:38 that are just
01:34:40 entertaining enough
01:34:42 that I don't get completely bored having it
01:34:44 on in the background
01:34:46 but are not so entertaining that I have to actually watch them
01:34:48 because I don't have a TV
01:34:50 in my house so I just have to
01:34:52 use a constant stream of like Anthony
01:34:54 Fantano videos as my version
01:34:56 of television and I need more
01:34:58 yeah that makes sense
01:35:00 I do the same thing
01:35:02 I'm gonna go on a
01:35:04 slightly different tack
01:35:06 I'm gonna say make
01:35:08 the greatest YouTube videos
01:35:10 of all time and change the landscape
01:35:12 forever more
01:35:14 by everyone

01:35:18 than everyone else

01:35:22 you know hire goals to aspire to
01:35:24 yeah I want
01:35:26 I want and like and be so good
