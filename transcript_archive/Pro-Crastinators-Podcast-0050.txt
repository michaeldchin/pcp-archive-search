00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Poopcast.
00:00:05 I'm the best guy ever. Man, that was a killer joke. Nailed it.
00:00:09 He really is the best guy ever.
00:00:12 The best poop ever. Oh, he did it again.
00:00:16 Yeah, he just keeps going nuts with that.
00:00:18 He just can't stop himself.
00:00:20 Here's Ben Saint is here.
00:00:22 Yeah, I am. Hi, fucker.
00:00:24 As is Mumkey Jones.
00:00:27 Cut my dick into pieces. This is my last showed.
00:00:33 And Digibro.
00:00:35 I woke up, I jacked my dick, and I came on the show.
00:00:40 You came on the show.
00:00:41 That's what you needed that half an hour for?
00:00:43 No, I jacked up before that half an hour.
00:00:46 Give me like 10 seconds and I'll do that shit real quick.
00:00:50 You're really pushing my times up there, Ben.
00:00:53 I'm not trying to like get fucking candles out and like fucking edge for the afternoon.
00:01:00 Can I just say that this is the first episode of PCP where I don't respect any of the co-hosts, even a little bit.
00:01:08 That's good. We tried to get Mage on, but she's busy.
00:01:10 Usually we have like a Mage or a Jess or a hippo, but today it's just like the worst of the bunch.
00:01:15 Yeah, yeah, this basket of deplorables here.
00:01:19 It's hashtag worst cast.
00:01:22 So today's a special day for the PCP, because this will be our 50th episode.

00:02:14 That's right.
00:02:15 And who knows what we'll do for the bonus episode next time.
00:02:18 We'll let you know.
00:02:19 Anyway, so we're talking about travel today.
00:02:22 Travel is the topic.
00:02:24 Yeah, because Monkey was just traveling.
00:02:26 He got home from traveling two hours ago, right?
00:02:29 Yeah, Nate, can I tell my own fucking story?
00:02:32 Jesus Christ.
00:02:32 All right, all right, I'm just leading in.
00:02:34 Go on, go on.
00:02:35 I'm transitioning.
00:02:36 I'm in the perfect condition to record a podcast about travel,
00:02:39 because I am right now the embodiment of how travel affects a person.
00:02:44 I am very sick and tired and my throat is all fucked.
00:02:48 And I can't even focus for more than like 30 seconds at a time
00:02:51 on anything because I woke up so early to travel.
00:02:54 So I'm very excited to talk about travel today and all the pros and cons
00:03:00 and cons and negatives and cons and bad parts.
00:03:04 So just tell us, where did you leave from and where did you arrive?
00:03:07 How long was this travel time?
00:03:10 I started off in North Carolina and I took a plane to Chicago
00:03:14 and then I took a plane here to Iowa.
00:03:16 So it's not the longest I've been on.
00:03:18 I mean, the longest travel time, we'll get into that later.
00:03:20 But this one was only five or six hours,
00:03:23 but I'm mostly just tired because I had to get up at like four in the morning.
00:03:27 Yep, yep.
00:03:28 I am also the embodiment of travel now because I just ate a pop tart
00:03:34 and got out of bed and walked over to your desk.
00:03:36 Stellar, stellar.
00:03:38 No, just now, like as we were recording, I have been eating a pop tart.
00:03:44 And I think that the only time I usually eat pop tarts is in travel
00:03:49 because it's a very convenient food to take with you, you know,
00:03:52 stuff. So I'm in your backpack or something.
00:03:55 When I travel, I always find that I eat a shit ton when I'm traveling.
00:04:00 I go to like fucking gross restaurants and I buy tons of shitty food and I eat it all
00:04:06 because it's like a vacation.
00:04:07 It's like a little fucking, I'm in transition.
00:04:10 What I do on this at this point in my life doesn't matter.
00:04:14 So I'll just go to like when I used to travel from home to college,
00:04:18 I would get on the fucking train from Providence to New York or something
00:04:23 and then take a bus from New York to New Jersey or something, whatever.
00:04:26 It doesn't matter.
00:04:26 Yeah, I did that too.
00:04:27 Point, yeah, point is I was stopped in New York and I would walk around
00:04:30 and I would fucking eat Krispy Kreme.
00:04:32 I would go and look for Krispy Kreme and fucking Penn Station
00:04:36 and I would eat Krispy Kreme because it was the only time
00:04:38 because they didn't have them in Massachusetts back then.
00:04:40 Penn Station had a good selection.
00:04:42 They had this good deep dish pizza I would get.
00:04:44 Penn Station is a great station.
00:04:46 One time I'd missed my train and I got stuck there overnight
00:04:49 and I had to sit slumped against a wall for an entire night.
00:04:54 That's like my worst nightmare.
00:04:56 It happened.
00:04:58 I had to sit slumped against a wall while fucking literally insane homeless people,
00:05:03 like swandered around like zombies.
00:05:05 You were SpongeBob in the rock bottom episode.
00:05:08 Yeah, I think so.
00:05:09 You were an urban street warrior for one night.
00:05:13 It was rough.
00:05:14 Since Davoo's not here on this episode, he said he didn't have enough to say about travel,
00:05:19 I guess, but I will share a similar story of his, which is that when he was flying back
00:05:24 after the events that transpired, which inspired the how we lost our virginity episode,
00:05:32 on his way back, his plane, they just, I guess they were repairing it.
00:05:37 He had to stay in the airport overnight.
00:05:40 Like almost a whole 20 hours or so that he was stuck in this airport
00:05:44 and they gave him like a bunch of vouchers for shit.
00:05:47 And I guess they had given him a voucher for a hotel room, like, you know,
00:05:50 the connected to the airport one, but he didn't take it because he was afraid
00:05:54 that he would sleep through alarms and not make his flight again.
00:05:59 So instead he opted 20 hours.
00:06:02 Yeah.
00:06:04 He opted to sleep in the airport instead, like to just lay on chairs and shit
00:06:10 and use their food vouchers and stuff.
00:06:13 So you know what airline that was?
00:06:15 I'm just curious.
00:06:16 I have no idea.
00:06:19 Southwest probably.
00:06:22 Yeah, that's the question based off of that that I'd like to open up to the panel.
00:06:25 Can you guys sleep when you're traveling?
00:06:28 Because personally, if I'm in the middle of traveling, like I can't sleep on the plane.
00:06:31 I can't sleep in the airport.
00:06:33 I can't sleep anywhere until I get to my destination.
00:06:35 I can only sleep if I am dead fucking tired, which has been the case a lot of the times,
00:06:40 but I have to be like killed.
00:06:42 I have a really hard time sleeping on buses and trains and planes and stuff.
00:06:46 So sometimes when I travel, I plan it so that I just don't sleep the night before.
00:06:50 So I'll have been up for like fucking 40 straight hours when I get on the bus.
00:06:54 And then I can fucking sleep on the trip.
00:06:56 I've tried things like that, and sometimes that doesn't mean I'll pass out.
00:07:01 It doesn't always, but it helps.
00:07:03 Every year that I go to Baltimore for Otacon, my cousin Boyd drives the car.
00:07:10 It's usually my car, but he drives.
00:07:12 And it's a four and a half hour to five hour drive.
00:07:15 And I usually am so excited about the con that I won't sleep for the night before.
00:07:20 And I'm thinking, I'll just sleep in the car on the way there.
00:07:23 And it never happens.
00:07:25 Like I'll be sitting there like utterly wracked with tiredness.
00:07:29 Like all I could think about is how badly I want to sleep.
00:07:31 But something about being in a car, I just can't do it.
00:07:35 And then somehow after Otacon's over and we're on the way home,
00:07:38 I pass out like a fucking, you know, I go out like a light and I'm just done the whole way back
00:07:43 because I'm just too physically out from having not really slept through most of the convention.
00:07:49 Oh, I hear you.
00:07:50 I hear you, my gay brother.
00:07:53 I am with you 100% in all of your endeavors.
00:07:57 Well, hey, I was going to say, you're welcome.
00:08:01 Yeah, it's been a very supportive guy.
00:08:05 In the, when I was traveling, I had some experience like that.
00:08:08 Well, okay, when I, when I, I have a very easy time sleeping.
00:08:11 You are on planes.
00:08:13 You used to fuck.
00:08:13 You used to fucking when we would, when we would stay up and watch adult swim,
00:08:17 you would fucking pass out way early.
00:08:19 You would miss all the latest anime.
00:08:21 I would.
00:08:22 That's something.
00:08:23 I think the reason me and my friends had that very, uh,
00:08:27 like my cousin is one of those guys who you can like see him fully asleep and snoring,
00:08:32 but he will insist he didn't fall asleep, like no matter what.
00:08:36 He'd be like, no, I wasn't sleeping, man.
00:08:38 I wasn't sleeping.
00:08:38 I was just pressing my eyes.
00:08:39 I kind of feel like that.
00:08:40 Like I think when me and Ben would be up watching anime late, like he would say,
00:08:44 are you asleep?
00:08:45 And like I had been like mostly unconscious, but I would like
00:08:48 flood her open my eyes and like see something on the screen.
00:08:50 He'd be like, no, I'm, I'm totally awake right now.
00:08:52 Yeah.
00:08:53 He would, he would like, he would like argue with you about it, that he wasn't asleep,
00:08:56 even though it was like, it was blatantly true.
00:08:58 But the reason is, because all of us had a certain like shame that we had missed the
00:09:04 animes, you know, like, like, like, like, like the one thing that we all cared about in life
00:09:10 was getting to watch anime, but it all airs at this late ass time period.
00:09:14 And so if you didn't make it to the end, if you didn't make it to 2am when they
00:09:18 restarted and do all the shows again, that it's like, oh, you, you fucking,
00:09:22 you just couldn't do it, man.
00:09:24 Like your passion wasn't strong enough, you know, if you were that, if you really cared,
00:09:28 you would have made it all the way through and powered through the sleep.
00:09:31 So I think that's why we, you know, none of us were accusing each other of that.
00:09:35 But I think that's what we were afraid of.
00:09:37 On the subject of sleeping while traveling, I did fucking buy a case of some like over
00:09:42 the counter sleeping pills, which I think just have like melanin or melatonin or whatever
00:09:46 the fucking sleeping thing is.
00:09:48 And sometimes I take those and I don't know if they actually help, but they feel like
00:09:53 they help and that's good enough.
00:09:54 So I would recommend those.
00:09:58 I hate the thing about the problem with sleeping while traveling.
00:10:02 The biggest problem by far is getting my head in a comfortable resting position.
00:10:08 Yeah.
00:10:08 Who else?
00:10:09 I mean, when you're on the plane, I always credit at the windows.
00:10:11 I just like looking at the window and like you always do the thing where your head is
00:10:14 like, I put it against the window, but there's like hard plastic there.
00:10:18 You kind of lean it back, but then your, your head will fucking be at a weird uncomfortable
00:10:22 angle where it's kind of like angling off your torso.
00:10:25 Cause it, it finally falls into that little like crack there and it's the worst.
00:10:29 And that's why they have travel pills, I guess.
00:10:32 I've been, I've been traveling a bunch lately.
00:10:34 I've been taking long ass bus rides to and from Atlanta and I've found some techniques.
00:10:41 I bring a blanket and I fucking tuck the blanket up behind my head because if I have that,
00:10:46 if I have that, then I can fucking rest my head against the crevice between window and
00:10:50 seats, which would otherwise be horribly uncomfortable and bumpy,
00:10:54 but with the blanket is quite tolerable.
00:10:57 And then I sit cross ways along the seat, take up both seats because fuck letting anyone sit next to me.
00:11:04 And I put down the armrest and I put my feet up against the armrest.
00:11:09 So I'm kind of squeeze myself into the, into the seat space,
00:11:12 kind of sandwiched in between the wall of the bus and the armrest with my head up in the blanket.
00:11:18 And that is pretty tolerable, highly recommended.
00:11:22 I hate squishing my legs when I'm trying to sleep.
00:11:25 It's very uncomfortable.
00:11:26 I feel like I need to be a little squished.
00:11:28 Really?
00:11:29 Yeah.
00:11:29 I'd like curl up a little bit.
00:11:31 Well, not always, but sometimes.
00:11:33 Should we all tell these stories of our individual biggest travel expeditions?
00:11:39 Yes, let's do that.
00:11:40 Yeah, we can talk about our bullshit if you want.
00:11:44 Okay.
00:11:45 Me too.
00:11:45 Monkey, tell us, tell us your tale, monkey.
00:11:48 What do you got?
00:11:48 Oh boy, it all started back in high school.
00:11:52 It starts with one thing.
00:11:54 You don't know why.
00:11:55 It doesn't even matter how hard you try.
00:11:58 The year was 1942 and I had heard some good stories about this place.
00:12:02 It's called Auschwitz and I really wanted to know what was going on.
00:12:06 The year was 1945 with just her sister at her side.
00:12:11 Anyway, exactly.
00:12:13 19, 19, 1942, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday comes again.
00:12:25 This is terrible.
00:12:26 This is the worst podcast of all time.
00:12:28 Whichever commenter writes a full Hitler parody of that song, the lyrics in the comments,
00:12:33 Ben is going to give them a thumbs up on their comments.
00:12:36 So Ben will give you a thumbs up.
00:12:38 Yeah.
00:12:38 I will record if you get all the syllable counts correct and you're not a fucking idiot and the
00:12:44 word's actually rhyme.
00:12:45 Correct rhyme schemes, right?
00:12:46 I'll do a quick sing-through and send it to Monkey for him to post on Monkey Jones too.
00:12:52 Oh, perfect.
00:12:53 Yeah, did you ever get a lot of reviews out of abusing you on that channel?
00:12:58 So it's been great so far.
00:12:59 Yeah.
00:12:59 All the shitposts we've recorded at your house have, like already the first four have garnered
00:13:04 me like five bucks.
00:13:05 And I'm like, okay, five bucks for doing nothing.
00:13:07 That sounds pretty cool.
00:13:08 Yeah, fuck.
00:13:08 He's recording Diddy sitting in his room.
00:13:10 And we've gotten easily 30 on those.
00:13:12 So.
00:13:13 Yeah, we do.
00:13:15 So it all started back in high school.
00:13:17 Little monkey boy.
00:13:18 He, it's not called the yellow fever when they're not Asian.
00:13:23 What's it called when you just want to fuck somebody who's not the same color as you?
00:13:26 Being a xenophile.
00:13:28 Being a xenophile outside your race?
00:13:29 I don't know.
00:13:30 It's called being like a race mixing?
00:13:31 Like a reverse cuck or something.
00:13:33 I don't know.
00:13:33 It's called being a devil spawn is going to hell.
00:13:37 Xenophile.
00:13:38 Xenophile.
00:13:40 Sure, okay.
00:13:40 Sure, okay.
00:13:41 Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
00:13:42 Little monkey boy at the age of 17 was a bit of a xenophile.
00:13:46 Yeah.
00:13:47 This gorgeous foreign exchange student girl.
00:13:50 Oh boy.
00:13:51 What kind of, what kind of, where's your front?
00:13:52 Where's your front?
00:13:52 Argentina, my friend.
00:13:54 Okay.
00:13:54 Argentina.
00:13:55 She's got that big Latin ass.
00:13:57 The widest country in South America.
00:13:59 So you know it's valuable.
00:14:00 Thank God.
00:14:01 Yeah.
00:14:02 Yeah.
00:14:02 Like she's only a little bit ethnic.
00:14:05 Phew.
00:14:06 You know, when you see a hot foreign exchange student girl,
00:14:10 you make sure that you're her best friend.
00:14:12 Because when they're in this foreign country,
00:14:13 they don't have any friends.
00:14:14 They don't have anybody.
00:14:15 So if you're the only shoulder they have to turn to,
00:14:18 maybe you get a little bit of that Argentinian puss.
00:14:20 Who knows?
00:14:20 And you can give them one of the like, you know,
00:14:23 no one in this country gives a fuck about you.
00:14:25 So you better do what I tell you to do.
00:14:27 Oh, you better, you better consume it.
00:14:29 That doesn't sound like negging.
00:14:30 That sounds like fucking negging.
00:14:31 That sounds like fucking...
00:14:33 Yeah, like I love to go up to girls in the club and neg them
00:14:35 with like, dude, I could totally snap your neck right now.
00:14:39 That does not look like,
00:14:40 you do not look like you have a well-toned neck, girl.
00:14:41 Let me just work on that again.
00:14:42 Or like you can teach them fake things
00:14:44 about American culture.
00:14:45 For example, in Argentina,
00:14:46 they do that thing where they greet each other
00:14:48 by kissing people on the cheek.
00:14:50 And I taught her here in America,
00:14:52 how you greet friends when you're alone in their house
00:14:55 and their host mother is gone,
00:14:57 is you pull down their pants and you suck their dick.
00:15:00 So I taught her that very important American custom.
00:15:03 So yeah, we became really good friends.
00:15:05 And naturally, she eventually had to go back home.
00:15:08 But we stayed in contact and she wanted me to come down
00:15:11 to Argentina to stay at her house with her family.
00:15:14 All right.
00:15:15 So that was a big old trip,
00:15:18 crazy plan and cost like $2,500 out of the monkey bank account.
00:15:23 That's like all months of working
00:15:25 at the local amusement park for that bullshit.
00:15:30 And the trip there was fine.
00:15:33 Like I had to take a plane from Iowa to Texas.
00:15:35 Wait, hold on.
00:15:36 I blanked out for a second,
00:15:37 but are you saying that you went all the way to Argentina
00:15:39 to get some poon?
00:15:40 That's right.
00:15:41 So you said you didn't do more than...
00:15:43 We're not that far in the story yet, did you?
00:15:45 I'm telling you about my very extravagant flight plan.
00:15:48 Okay.
00:15:48 Well, I'm just shocked because like on the virginity episode,
00:15:52 we were all talking about how much we paid to lose our virginity
00:15:55 and monkeys over here flying out of the fucking country.
00:15:58 Well, sure.
00:15:58 I paid like fucking $400 million thousand
00:16:02 because I had to go to college to do it.
00:16:04 That's true.
00:16:05 Wait, had you had sex with this girl before this trip?
00:16:08 No.
00:16:09 Okay.
00:16:10 What?
00:16:11 Did you suck your dick?
00:16:13 Ben, please.
00:16:14 I do not kiss and tell.
00:16:16 I'm a gentleman.
00:16:17 I mean, fine.
00:16:18 But do you get your dick sucked in town?
00:16:20 I'm loud and angry.
00:16:21 I don't know.
00:16:21 Wait, wait.
00:16:23 But so, monkey.
00:16:24 Okay.
00:16:24 You were talking about a flight plan.
00:16:26 So getting your dick sucked was that part of your plan?
00:16:29 Now, you don't get to bring friends
00:16:31 because the flight plan I just filed at the agency lists me,
00:16:34 my men, and Dr. Pavel here, but only one of you.
00:16:37 Okay.
00:16:37 Okay.
00:16:38 Was your erection rising
00:16:39 during this flight?
00:16:40 How does that happen?
00:16:42 Okay.
00:16:44 For you.
00:16:46 All right.
00:16:47 So just to get there, it's like 18 hours.
00:16:50 You go Iowa to Texas, Texas to,
00:16:53 you got to go to like the southern most point,
00:16:55 the capital of Argentina.
00:16:57 I don't remember what it's called.
00:16:58 San San Andreas.
00:17:01 No, it's not San Andreas.
00:17:03 I don't remember.
00:17:04 I can't remember.
00:17:05 But then she lived in Salta.
00:17:07 So I had to actually fly down to the southern tip of Argentina
00:17:11 and then take a transfer flight going back up north.
00:17:14 So it was way out of the way, super long flight.
00:17:17 Where it went bad was the flight home.
00:17:20 Because when you're in these foreign airports,
00:17:22 like most of the signs are in Spanish.
00:17:24 Oh no, I should tell you, I guess,
00:17:26 if I'm going to weave a whole yarn here,
00:17:28 going through customs on my way into Argentina
00:17:31 was an absolute nightmare.
00:17:33 Because when you're a foreigner.
00:17:34 On your way into Argentina.
00:17:35 Yeah, yeah.
00:17:36 Because you have to show them your passport
00:17:39 and then like some little dude in like a glass booth
00:17:42 interviews every single person.
00:17:44 So you're waiting in line for like three years
00:17:46 to get through all these interviews
00:17:47 and stuff of all the foreigners coming in.
00:17:49 But the motherfucker, and I guess this is my fault,
00:17:52 the guy who had to interview me to enter the country,
00:17:55 only spoke Spanish and I only speak English.
00:17:59 So you can imagine how that interview went.
00:18:01 It was about 20 minutes of him getting very frustrated with me
00:18:05 that I don't even know like the most common things in Spanish.
00:18:07 It took a few years, but obviously not enough.
00:18:10 And here's a hint for anybody who wants to become a terrorist.
00:18:14 No dude, I'm on the fucking PCP right now.
00:18:17 You can't have your microphone.
00:18:18 You presumptuous bastard.
00:18:21 Here's a hint for anybody who wants to become a terrorist
00:18:23 in a foreign country.
00:18:24 Just don't learn their language because the customs guy
00:18:27 will get so mad that you can't talk to him
00:18:29 that he'll just shrug his shoulders
00:18:31 and let you go on through anyway.
00:18:33 So that's my advice.
00:18:34 Good. Good.
00:18:35 Anyway, so the nightmare is coming back home
00:18:38 because the fear is one of my flights will get cancelled or something
00:18:41 and then I'm trapped in a foreign country
00:18:43 and I don't know who to talk to to get my new flight and all that shit.
00:18:47 Luckily, nothing got cancelled until I got to Texas
00:18:50 and then my flight home to Iowa got fucked and cancelled.
00:18:55 And as I said before, I cannot sleep while I'm in the middle of traveling.
00:18:58 So I'm just sitting at this airport already 18 hours into traveling
00:19:02 just losing my fucking mind.
00:19:04 There is, I'm telling you, airports are fucked.
00:19:08 They're so fucked because if your flight gets cancelled,
00:19:10 it's game over.
00:19:11 You're done.
00:19:11 There's no really place to sleep.
00:19:13 Like they should have like little sleep chamber pods
00:19:15 that you can go like rent and sleep in
00:19:17 and they'll wake you up when your flight's ready.
00:19:19 But they don't have shit.
00:19:20 You're pretty much stuck in a divorce thing
00:19:21 where either you go get a hotel room
00:19:23 and they don't offer me a free thing.
00:19:25 Like I'd have to go pay for a hotel room
00:19:27 and then risk missing the flight again
00:19:29 or sleep on the fucking chair.
00:19:30 Hope that nobody steals your bags.
00:19:32 Get fucked, you fucking faggot.
00:19:34 And the long story short is I eventually get home
00:19:37 after being awake for 30 hours
00:19:40 and it was the most miserable, tired,
00:19:42 terrible experience of my life.
00:19:45 So typically I think traveling's okay,
00:19:47 but that one instance was just fucked.
00:19:53 Gay.
00:19:53 That's shit time, dude.
00:19:54 I've, yeah, I've had a bunch of flights like that.
00:19:57 Like now that I'm older and shit
00:19:59 and I live like farther away from where I grew up,
00:20:01 I've been flying a lot pretty regularly
00:20:03 and like American Airlines is the worst,
00:20:06 I think that I found.
00:20:08 They, yeah, like I think on two separate occasions,
00:20:10 I learned after the second time not to fly with them,
00:20:13 like one time my flight just got kept getting delayed
00:20:16 and kept getting fucking delayed
00:20:17 and then just got pushed back to the next day.
00:20:19 So I think on that day, like since I had my car,
00:20:22 since I'm a fucking adult,
00:20:23 I just drove back home and then drove in the next day.
00:20:25 But the other time, I don't know,
00:20:27 like I didn't want to for whatever reason,
00:20:28 like the flight was really early in the morning the next day.
00:20:31 So, you know, I was lucky enough
00:20:33 that they did offer me a hotel voucher.
00:20:35 So I just fucking, you know,
00:20:37 got in the shuttle with a bunch of people
00:20:38 who also got fucked over,
00:20:39 stayed at a hotel for a night,
00:20:42 got in my flight the next morning and got gone.
00:20:44 But the fact that they have so much like
00:20:49 ability to just screw over people,
00:20:50 the ability of an airline to fuck people over is so vast
00:20:55 that it seems like they are disproportionately unaccountable
00:21:00 for the damage that they do every single day
00:21:02 by just being incompetent at their fucking jobs.
00:21:04 And they do it to hundreds of people at a time
00:21:06 and then when confronted with like how they're ruining
00:21:09 so many people's not only day,
00:21:11 probably a week and maybe even life
00:21:13 by shortening it with all the stress.
00:21:15 They have the attitude of shrugger,
00:21:17 fuck off, I don't care.
00:21:18 Fuck you, it's my job, fuck you.
00:21:20 Yeah, I don't know, man.
00:21:22 I wish I had a solution.
00:21:24 Maybe there's something we can talk about.
00:21:25 Ways to improve or completely destroy the system
00:21:28 and don't even give people the illusion
00:21:30 that travel is something that you want to do.
00:21:32 Just say no, just stay where you are.
00:21:33 We're abolishing flights.
00:21:35 You just live where you live and that's it.
00:21:37 We gotta wait for the teleporters.
00:21:39 That's what I'm saying, Doug.
00:21:40 It's travel.
00:21:41 I would be, travel is so shit.
00:21:42 That's really the point at the end of this.
00:21:45 Travel is so garbage that I want to basically not exist
00:21:48 by just having teleporters like they do in fucking Star Trek
00:21:50 and just be anywhere you want immediately.
00:21:52 Travel is retarded.
00:21:53 There's nothing good about it.
00:21:55 I hate it.
00:21:56 You know, honestly, I don't mind travel.
00:21:59 I mind the cost of travel.
00:22:01 That's the main reason I don't do it
00:22:03 is because I'm a cheapskate
00:22:04 and the thought of like spending hundreds of dollars
00:22:09 just to go do something is just too,
00:22:13 it's too much for my brain to handle,
00:22:15 even if I can afford it.
00:22:17 For every calculation like that,
00:22:18 you gotta think like, okay,
00:22:19 I'm gonna go fly, I don't know, to this place
00:22:22 and fuck this slut.
00:22:23 That's the plan, okay.
00:22:25 Now, how much am I willing to invest
00:22:28 in this operation here?
00:22:29 Like, am I gonna spend like $1,000?
00:22:32 You know, I mean, that's fine in some cases,
00:22:35 but to do it regularly,
00:22:37 to make it a part of your life,
00:22:38 it's prohibitively expensive.
00:22:39 Well, even like, we all agreed
00:22:41 that on the losing of virginity video,
00:22:44 that for the first time, you spare no expense.
00:22:47 That's right, no price is too much to pay.
00:22:49 Yeah, but then after that,
00:22:51 you're like, well, now I understand what sex is,
00:22:54 I understand that it's not that big a deal.
00:22:56 Am I even willing to spend $100 on this?
00:22:59 Well, don't forget, Digi,
00:23:01 your virginity regrows as you go on without having sex though.
00:23:05 We gotta keep that in mind, yep.
00:23:07 But like, sex is not withstanding,
00:23:10 just going anywhere to do anything.
00:23:12 Like, for instance, the dick show
00:23:15 is going to start doing these live shows.
00:23:18 Road rage.
00:23:19 Yeah, his road rage.
00:23:21 And he's going to do a show in LA
00:23:22 and a show in Philadelphia.
00:23:24 Those are the two that are planned.
00:23:26 Whether or not it continues from there,
00:23:27 we have no idea.
00:23:28 There's no further plans beyond that.
00:23:30 So he's going to do a show in Philadelphia.
00:23:32 Now, I'm looking at it like,
00:23:34 Philadelphia is not that far from me, right?
00:23:37 Like, it would either be a short,
00:23:40 inexpensive flight,
00:23:41 or a eight hour drive,
00:23:44 seven or eight hour drive.
00:23:45 So, and I have,
00:23:48 I think I probably have friends in Philadelphia,
00:23:50 I can't remember if Jeff Burgess lives in Philadelphia
00:23:52 or Pittsburgh,
00:23:53 but if he lives in Philly,
00:23:54 maybe I'll do it.
00:23:55 But like, so he's doing this,
00:23:56 this taxationist theft show in Philadelphia.
00:24:00 And I have to look at it and go,
00:24:01 all right, well,
00:24:02 first of all,
00:24:03 we've got the travel time,
00:24:05 which is, you know,
00:24:06 eight hours there,
00:24:06 eight hours back.
00:24:07 If I go, like,
00:24:09 if I go there and I don't want a hotel,
00:24:11 that means I'm just going to,
00:24:12 like, drive all day for a,
00:24:15 probably two hour show, you know?
00:24:17 Or I stay the night
00:24:21 and then waste the whole next day as well.
00:24:23 That's two days of just driving,
00:24:26 just to see this one thing.
00:24:28 And like,
00:24:29 and then I'm thinking about what the,
00:24:30 if I take a car,
00:24:31 that's probably going to be $100 of gas.
00:24:34 If I take a flight,
00:24:35 it's a, you know,
00:24:36 what if I have to get a hotel,
00:24:38 $100 on a hotel,
00:24:40 however much it costs,
00:24:41 you know, depending on where you are.
00:24:42 In New York,
00:24:44 like, New York trips
00:24:45 are almost prohibitively expensive
00:24:47 just because of, like, lodging.
00:24:50 Like, it's so expensive
00:24:52 to get a hotel in New York.
00:24:54 It's like, you know,
00:24:55 like over $100 a night that it's like,
00:24:57 A lot of people do day trips to New York, I think.
00:25:00 Yeah.
00:25:00 Like, I have here in Virginia Beach,
00:25:02 we have something called the Chinatown Bus,
00:25:04 which is just a bus that goes straight
00:25:07 to Chinatown, New York,
00:25:08 no stops.
00:25:10 And it's like 50 bucks.
00:25:11 So getting to New York,
00:25:13 very cheap, very easy.
00:25:15 It's like 10 hour, 10, 12 hour drive,
00:25:18 you know, whatever.
00:25:18 It's a waste of time,
00:25:20 but yeah, it's a cheap, easy trip.
00:25:22 But staying in New York,
00:25:24 that's where you're gonna suddenly rack up
00:25:26 hundreds of dollars
00:25:27 just to fucking be in a place.
00:25:30 You know, not even to do things there.
00:25:32 Let's not even talk about the fact
00:25:33 that if you wanna actually do things there,
00:25:36 now you're gonna be spending all this,
00:25:38 and if you go to some other town,
00:25:40 you're not gonna go eat fast food.
00:25:42 That's not why you came, you know.
00:25:44 You're gonna go some cool place
00:25:45 that's gonna cost more dozens,
00:25:48 if not hundreds of dollars to do all the stuff.
00:25:50 So like the total travel cost
00:25:52 just racks up and racks up.
00:25:54 And it's like, you know,
00:25:56 you really gotta be willing to just part
00:25:59 with what you have
00:26:01 in the name of good times.
00:26:02 That's true, that's very true.
00:26:03 And not to mention like you were saying,
00:26:06 to know kind of like what's,
00:26:09 when you're going to a new place,
00:26:11 you don't necessarily know
00:26:12 if it's a fun place to spend time,
00:26:14 or just like what to do
00:26:16 to have a good time while you're there.
00:26:17 So you pretty much need to have somebody
00:26:19 on the other end who's willing to donate
00:26:21 their time, like a friend or whatever,
00:26:22 that's gonna like, or research it extensively.
00:26:24 But even then, you never know what you're gonna find.
00:26:26 So you also have to like know
00:26:28 that it's gonna be a good time ahead of time.
00:26:30 And like I also had like a trip
00:26:33 that I was thinking of doing,
00:26:35 and also didn't,
00:26:36 cause like it's probably not worth it ultimately.
00:26:38 But like Tim and Eric,
00:26:40 I've just announced they're doing
00:26:41 a 10 year anniversary tour
00:26:43 for the 10 year anniversary of Tim and Eric,
00:26:47 awesome show, great job.
00:26:48 And I would love to go to,
00:26:49 cause Tim and Eric are two of my favorite people
00:26:51 in the fucking world,
00:26:52 and awesome show was like one of my favorite shows ever.
00:26:56 But they're not coming,
00:26:57 they're coming to Chicago,
00:26:57 but that's like four hours away from here.
00:26:59 And I'm not gonna do that.
00:27:00 I would love to go,
00:27:01 and my hope would have been to have gone,
00:27:03 to that show in Seattle, I think,
00:27:05 with my buddy John,
00:27:06 who also is just a huge super fan.
00:27:09 And we fucking fell in love with that shit together.
00:27:12 It would be a wonderful experience
00:27:13 to hang out with him and my other friends out in Seattle,
00:27:15 but I'm not gonna fucking pay $400 to go out
00:27:19 for a one fucking time show for two hours,
00:27:22 and then just come back.
00:27:23 And like, I guess I could like bundle it into like,
00:27:26 oh, let's also hang out with the guys,
00:27:27 but I got shit to do.
00:27:29 I don't have time to fucking hang out
00:27:30 with my friends all the time.
00:27:32 I got work to that needs to get done.
00:27:34 That's why I need to teleport.
00:27:35 If I could just fucking teleport there
00:27:37 and do my shit,
00:27:40 it'd be the best.
00:27:40 You know, I have this beautiful vision
00:27:43 of like constantly traveling
00:27:47 and doing things with people and stuff.
00:27:49 And then what you always realize only afterwards
00:27:52 is that like, you just suddenly look at the calendar
00:27:55 and realize that days are gone,
00:27:57 and whatever you haven't done yet
00:27:59 is now a pressing matter.
00:28:01 Like for instance,
00:28:02 Monkey came to my house about a week ago
00:28:05 as part of this travel that he was doing,
00:28:08 who stayed the night,
00:28:09 and we recorded a shitload of Let's Plays.
00:28:13 And you may have noticed
00:28:14 that none of them have come out yet.
00:28:16 And that's because-
00:28:17 I have come to expect this of you, did you?
00:28:19 Well, it doesn't help-
00:28:20 I'm expecting you to see them probably in May.
00:28:22 Well, we recorded a ton of them,
00:28:24 and you don't even realize, Monkey,
00:28:25 that after you left,
00:28:27 me and Ben and DeVu made five more Let's Plays.
00:28:30 Just that night.
00:28:31 Like, we kept going to like seven in the morning or something.
00:28:34 Shit.
00:28:34 So yeah, I've got a whole desktop
00:28:36 full of fucking Let's Plays.
00:28:37 And the reason that I didn't get around to editing them
00:28:40 is that, like, leading up to Monkey coming over,
00:28:43 I was, like, anticipating.
00:28:44 I'm like, yeah, I'm going to hang out with Monkey.
00:28:46 This is the most fun thing I'm going to do this month, probably.
00:28:48 Monkey comes over-
00:28:49 Probably this year.
00:28:50 We recorded all these Let's Plays.
00:28:50 It sucked.
00:28:51 It was garbage.
00:28:52 No, we did a bunch of stuff for two days,
00:28:55 and then he leaves,
00:28:55 and then I'm like, oh, God,
00:28:57 it's now March 20th or so.
00:29:02 I have to make two more videos
00:29:03 before this month is over,
00:29:05 and start planning for what I'm going to do in April.
00:29:08 So the second Monkey's gone,
00:29:09 it's like, well, now we just got to work constantly.
00:29:11 You know, and I don't have time to just sit around
00:29:13 and edit all these Let's Plays,
00:29:14 because I'm going to be, like, just outputting.
00:29:16 You know, all I've been doing is, like,
00:29:17 making shit nonstop for the main channel since he left.
00:29:21 So that's what happens every time I travel.
00:29:24 It's like, I go, I have fun for four or five days,
00:29:27 and I come back, and I realize that a huge chunk of the month
00:29:29 is just gone, and now, like, you know, it's grind time.
00:29:34 Let me tell you one more thing real quick.
00:29:36 It's just, it's my vision for the future.
00:29:39 Well, it's whatever.
00:29:40 So in Star Trek, there's this wonderful thing that's painted.
00:29:44 I know, I'm becoming like Mike,
00:29:46 and I love it so much.
00:29:49 So in Star Trek, Deep Space Nine,
00:29:53 there is a couple scenes where Commander Sisko's son,
00:29:59 I think, is, like, visiting the academy
00:30:00 or something, or something's going on,
00:30:01 or like, oh, no, what is this?
00:30:03 Sisko is, like, he's back on Earth
00:30:05 for some assignment, doesn't matter.
00:30:07 But the point is, like, he, his family lives in Louisiana,
00:30:11 in New Orleans, and he loves that place,
00:30:14 but Starfleet headquarters is in San Francisco, California.
00:30:18 So, like, what his day is like is that he gets up,
00:30:21 has breakfast in his house, gets in a fucking teleporter,
00:30:24 gets phased over to San Francisco, has his day there,
00:30:28 and then just is instantly, at the end of the day,
00:30:30 he just fucking teleports back to Louisiana,
00:30:32 has dinner with his family, is fucking great time.
00:30:35 And it's just, and they just, like, they just talk about,
00:30:37 like, oh, hey, you know, I was, yeah, I was just in San Francisco.
00:30:39 10 seconds later, I'm here in fucking New Orleans.
00:30:42 It's the greatest thing in the world.
00:30:44 It's just, it's just like how cars enabled us
00:30:46 to travel a little bit.
00:30:48 Teleporters enable you to travel
00:30:49 a thousand billion million miles in a second,
00:30:51 and it just becomes part of life.
00:30:53 And I can't even think about all the ways
00:30:54 it would make life better and different and interesting.
00:30:57 Oh, it's, oh, it's, it's, it brings a tear to my eye.
00:31:00 It's so beautiful.
00:31:01 It's, I want that so badly.
00:31:03 It'd be pretty fucking sweet.
00:31:05 Too bad we live in the real world,
00:31:07 where we have to pay taxes and, and jerk ourselves off.
00:31:12 Oh shit, thanks for reminding me.
00:31:13 I still haven't fucking submitted my taxes yet.
00:31:15 Oh, God, I need to do that too.
00:31:17 That's in like a month, that's due.
00:31:18 Yep, I need to submit my shit to my tax people.
00:31:20 Oh, no.
00:31:23 Oh, tax cast.
00:31:24 Ben, have you, have you paid your taxes, Ben?
00:31:27 What's going on with your taxes?
00:31:28 Have I?
00:31:30 Yeah, yeah.
00:31:31 Have you filed?
00:31:31 Why would you think I made my taxes?
00:31:34 Have you filed?
00:31:35 I mean, don't you have to file?
00:31:36 If you're-
00:31:36 What, have you?
00:31:37 You fuck?
00:31:38 Well, no, but I'm aware that I need you.
00:31:39 Judgy McJudgerson?
00:31:41 I'm not, I'm just saying.
00:31:42 I have plans to do so with, with, uh, like a tax lady.
00:31:46 With, on sunny, you know, does our taxes talk?
00:31:47 I have, yeah, I have ten, I'm gonna figure it out.
00:31:50 I know how I'm gonna figure it out.
00:31:51 I know I'll do it soon, someday.
00:31:54 Someday I'll pay taxes.
00:31:55 Yeah, I always end up doing it.
00:31:57 Ben, what's your craziest travel story?
00:32:00 Uh, my-
00:32:02 I know you're a big hitchhiker.
00:32:03 So, so are we exclusive-
00:32:04 Oh yeah, fucking hitchhiked that one time.
00:32:06 Hold on, before we continue here,
00:32:07 are we exclusively talking about the act of travel?
00:32:11 Is that-
00:32:12 I don't think it's anything about traveling.
00:32:13 Well, because Monkey's story was literally only about the flights that he took,
00:32:17 and nothing about Argentina whatsoever.
00:32:20 Well, that's not interesting.
00:32:21 It's the vastly more interesting subject,
00:32:24 but if we're gonna focus on just the travel, that's fine.
00:32:29 You can do whatever you want.
00:32:30 I, uh, when I was, I fucking,
00:32:36 when I fucking moved to California,
00:32:38 and was an astro camp fucking instructor for a while,
00:32:40 and I lived in the mountains,
00:32:42 and then I fucking lost that job,
00:32:44 and then I fucking hitchhiked to the fucking, to my aunt's house,
00:32:48 and then I fucking, I don't know,
00:32:50 go watch my fucking Nuzlocke of the Black one.
00:32:54 You know, I told that story.
00:32:56 That was fun.
00:32:58 I got fucking pulled over by the police.
00:32:59 The police, they tried to arrest me.
00:33:01 They tried to arrest me for hitchhiking,
00:33:02 and I came up with a story.
00:33:04 They were like,
00:33:04 you can't be here on the fucking highway.
00:33:06 And I said,
00:33:07 oh, my, uh, my girlfriend,
00:33:09 we had a fight and she kicked me out of the car,
00:33:11 and they took pity,
00:33:13 and they took pity on me,
00:33:14 and they said, oh, buddy,
00:33:15 oh, I'm so sorry.
00:33:16 I'm sorry that happened.
00:33:18 How did that story not fall apart the moment that they looked at your face?
00:33:23 Well, good question.
00:33:25 I can't answer it.
00:33:27 The cops were gay, obviously.
00:33:28 Oh, yeah.
00:33:29 They wanted to piece that shit, yeah.
00:33:32 And they, uh,
00:33:34 oh, yeah, and they put me on the fucking on-ramp.
00:33:36 They were like, okay, technically,
00:33:37 you're not allowed to be on the freeway,
00:33:38 but you're technically allowed to stand on this on-ramp
00:33:41 and hitchhike.
00:33:41 Good luck, buddy.
00:33:42 And I said, thanks, law man.
00:33:44 And I winked at them gaily.
00:33:48 And there's more to this.
00:33:48 Pull out my crack.
00:33:49 There's more to that story.
00:33:50 Ben does have a very famously effective wink.
00:33:54 Do I?
00:33:55 Is that true?
00:33:56 Yeah.
00:33:56 Sure.
00:33:56 Wow.
00:33:57 Yeah, that's true.
00:33:57 And the part of the story I've never understood
00:33:59 is why you decided to hitchhike across the country
00:34:02 when you could have just flown home.
00:34:04 Flo-
00:34:05 First of all, I wasn't going home.
00:34:07 Second of all, flying is expensive.
00:34:09 Third of all, I just felt like hitchhiking.
00:34:11 The fucking, my job at AstroCab ended,
00:34:14 and I didn't, and I hadn't bought a ticket.
00:34:16 I hadn't bought a plane ticket or a train ticket or anything,
00:34:19 to my aunt's house.
00:34:20 And I was like, well, it's only like three states away.
00:34:24 And I, and they dropped me off at the airport.
00:34:26 And I was like, well, I didn't actually buy a ticket.
00:34:29 I didn't tell them this.
00:34:30 I didn't tell them that I didn't buy it.
00:34:31 I just had dropped me off at the airport.
00:34:33 And I got off at the airport, and I looked up at the sun.
00:34:36 And I said, judging by the position of the sun,
00:34:38 I think east is this way.
00:34:40 And I just started walking in that direction.
00:34:43 What year was this, and did you have a phone?
00:34:46 Yeah, I had a phone.
00:34:47 But I wanted to hitchhike.
00:34:49 And this was like 2012, 2011.
00:34:52 Your alternative lifestyle disgusts me.
00:34:55 I'm just sick of it.
00:34:56 Me too.
00:34:58 You are a parasite on this great land of America.
00:35:01 Oh man.
00:35:02 But then when I got to Aunt Steph's house,
00:35:06 I was there for a little while.
00:35:07 And then I went back to Northern California
00:35:09 to live with one of my AstroCamp friends.
00:35:11 And that was one of the best days of my life,
00:35:13 because I had like a 22-hour train ride.
00:35:16 And it was so relaxing.
00:35:18 And I played Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup for like 22 hours
00:35:22 on a fucking train ride to fucking California
00:35:25 to live with a bunch of cool faggots
00:35:28 that let me stay in their house for free
00:35:30 for what was supposed to be a few weeks,
00:35:32 but ended up being like six months
00:35:34 before they were finally like,
00:35:35 Ben, you need to start paying rent.
00:35:37 And I said, OK, I understand.
00:35:39 And then I paid like two months of rent.
00:35:41 And then I ran out of money and was like,
00:35:42 well, I can't pay rent anymore.
00:35:44 And they said, well, get out.
00:35:46 And I said, yep, I'll go home now.
00:35:48 And they did.
00:35:50 That seems pretty...
00:35:52 Yeah, it seems like a pretty legitimate transaction there.
00:35:54 Yeah, yeah.
00:35:56 It was legit.
00:35:56 I didn't screw anyone over.
00:35:58 I'm a good boy.
00:35:59 Yeah.
00:36:01 Oh, yeah.
00:36:01 And then I went to Poland.
00:36:03 And then I went to Poland to teach physics.
00:36:05 And then that was a plane ride, but whatever.
00:36:08 And then for Christmas that year, for Christmas that year...
00:36:12 Ben, how did you go from world traveling teacher
00:36:15 to eating Digi's leftovers every day?
00:36:18 I will tell you the story of how that happened.
00:36:21 Not even exaggerating their name.
00:36:23 I went to Poland.
00:36:26 And I taught physics.
00:36:27 And my students hated me.
00:36:29 And they gave me bad reviews.
00:36:30 And they said, get out.
00:36:34 Yeah, you like that?
00:36:35 You like that, monkey?
00:36:37 Oh, man.
00:36:38 And they said...
00:36:38 It's just like your PCP lecture.
00:36:40 All the students hated you.
00:36:41 Yeah, it's right.
00:36:44 That's true.
00:36:45 And they fucking down...
00:36:46 I see the Polish...
00:36:48 They downloaded you as a person.
00:36:51 The job had given me this fucking swanky high-rise apartment in the center of town.
00:36:56 And I was like, well, I'm too...
00:36:59 They were like, we're not going to pay for your apartment anymore.
00:37:01 And I was like, landlord, please, give me a different room.
00:37:04 And they were like, okay, we'll move you right downstairs
00:37:07 into this fucking dingy-ass fucking hole in the fucking wall,
00:37:10 where you'll technically be sharing it with like a 90-year-old woman
00:37:13 who's just living there waiting to die.
00:37:15 And there's no running water.
00:37:17 And there's no fucking kitchen.
00:37:18 All you have is a hot plate.
00:37:20 And there's no bed.
00:37:21 And the heater is just a big stone pillar in the center of the room
00:37:24 that fucking gets hot sometimes.
00:37:26 Fuck yeah.
00:37:28 So watch out for that.
00:37:29 You're in the lap of luxury over there.
00:37:30 Oh, it was a good time.
00:37:32 Where's my stone pillar gone, Dan?
00:37:35 And I was like, well...
00:37:37 They'll give you a woman to have sex with.
00:37:38 That's right.
00:37:40 That's right.
00:37:41 And then for Christmas, for Christmas,
00:37:44 I had heard that Christmas in Tartu Estonia was the best party.
00:37:47 And I went to Tartu Estonia for, no, for New Year's.
00:37:50 And it was wonderful.
00:37:52 And then I fucking was like, well, I'll take all the money
00:37:55 that I save working in physics.
00:37:57 And I fucking took a fucking train and bus
00:38:00 and fucking walking trip for like three months.
00:38:02 And I went across fucking Germany and France and England to Ireland.
00:38:06 And then I was in Ireland for fucking, what's the word, St. Patrick's Day.
00:38:10 And I was doing that for like three months and it took forever.
00:38:13 And you know what?
00:38:13 You know what?
00:38:14 I got really bored of it after a while.
00:38:16 After a while, I was just like, you know what?
00:38:18 The world kind of sucks and everything is pretty much the same as everything else.
00:38:22 And it's like that old saw.
00:38:23 It's like that old saying, wherever you go, there you are.
00:38:27 It's like, it's all the fucking same.
00:38:28 It's just whatever.
00:38:29 You just, you meet new people, but they're the same as the old people.
00:38:32 Fuck it.
00:38:32 And I was like, and I was like, when I go home,
00:38:35 when I go home to America, once I run out of money, which I just did,
00:38:40 I'm gonna, I'm gonna say fuck it.
00:38:42 I don't want to go anywhere anymore.
00:38:43 I'm gonna fucking sit in my room.
00:38:45 And the only fucking thing I care about is like my fucking mind.
00:38:49 I'm just going to cultivate my mind instead.
00:38:51 Fuck the outside world.
00:38:52 I'm only going to look inside for the rest of my miserable life.
00:38:56 And that's what I did.
00:38:58 And I learned how to draw and I fucking got good.
00:39:00 And I became the greatest hero of a generation.
00:39:03 And that's my story.
00:39:03 And that's how I ended up eating leftovers out of Digi's garbage for months.
00:39:07 He cultivated his mind so hard, he had no choice,
00:39:10 but to eat those leftovers out of Digi's garbage.
00:39:12 That's right.
00:39:13 I cultivated my mind so hard that I didn't even want it.
00:39:16 That's what I call a highly trained mind.
00:39:18 Yeah.
00:39:19 Ben, I just want to ask, there are probably a lot of
00:39:22 impressional young minds in the audience who aspire to be an artist.
00:39:26 To eating garbage as well.
00:39:27 To go insane.
00:39:28 Yeah, that's right.
00:39:28 My question is, would you recommend this lifestyle or would you say pursue the teaching
00:39:33 instead of- I frankly don't understand why everyone doesn't live exactly the way I have.
00:39:38 I think people long for a little more stability than you have.
00:39:42 It confuses and disgusts me.
00:39:46 Everyone is not just like me.
00:39:48 To have a life with no future or prospects or like money,
00:39:51 it's kind of scary for most people.
00:39:53 Not me though.
00:39:55 Boy, boy.
00:39:56 Aren't you currently financially unsustainable in the very long term though?
00:40:00 Um, in the very long term?
00:40:03 Yeah.
00:40:04 But like, I'm okay for now.
00:40:06 I'm okay for now.
00:40:07 I'm okay for now.
00:40:09 Patreon.com.
00:40:10 Like for today.
00:40:11 Save him.
00:40:12 Yeah, save him.
00:40:14 Hashtag save him.
00:40:15 Yeah.
00:40:15 Yes, exactly.
00:40:18 Your definition of being okay for now is if Digi ordered a pizza last night.
00:40:25 That would save the day.
00:40:27 That would save the day.
00:40:28 Oh, shit.
00:40:31 Or Victor.
00:40:32 Victor gives me fucking crazy leftovers.
00:40:35 Victor's always buying food, chaining his mind, losing his appetite,
00:40:39 and being like, Ben, you want this?
00:40:40 And that's like half of what I eat.
00:40:41 You know, Ben, I noticed when we were at their house,
00:40:43 like when we were growing up, nobody ever left leftovers.
00:40:47 Like they were consumed immediately.
00:40:48 But the Collins family ain't quite like that.
00:40:52 No.
00:40:53 And none of us eat around leftovers.
00:40:55 So anything that gets left over is just passed to somebody else.
00:40:59 It's bizarre.
00:41:00 Like for me and Ben, that's just an opportunity.
00:41:02 I never leave anything uneaten, like never, ever.
00:41:06 I just, if I, you know, if I get something and then realize halfway through that I don't
00:41:12 like it anymore, then it's gone.
00:41:14 Well, I mean, maybe it's just because we were like, we didn't have as many options as kids.
00:41:20 Like we were just fucking eight or whatever.
00:41:21 I mean, it's just that my dad has always been like,
00:41:26 very like anti leftovers just because he's like a germaphobe.
00:41:30 So I just don't think there was a culture of leftovers in the house if you get what I'm saying.
00:41:36 I see.
00:41:37 We're all picky eaters, really picky eaters, everybody.
00:41:40 I want to hear the story of how did you went to the Philippines to have gay six?
00:41:44 Yeah.
00:41:45 Yeah.
00:41:45 We've all been wondering.
00:41:47 So I'll tell you the travel story of going to the Philippines,
00:41:51 which is, I guess, interesting in its own right.
00:41:53 Oh, yeah.
00:41:55 So I should wait.
00:41:56 I want to mention about my story that I fucking snuck on trains.
00:41:59 I snuck on trains.
00:42:00 Oh, sweet.
00:42:00 I didn't pay for tickets all the time.
00:42:01 Like the homeless man, like you jumped onto a moving train into a little box car.
00:42:05 No, like a can of beans and you have a beer and shit.
00:42:08 And a bindle.
00:42:09 No, like I would get on a train with no ticket and I would just be like, well,
00:42:14 this train ride is an hour and I would just go sit in the bathroom on the train for an hour
00:42:19 and no one would check my ticket or Ben or I would sit down on a seat.
00:42:23 Wait till I saw the conductor coming to check tickets and then go to the bathroom.
00:42:27 Wait until they pass through the car and then go sit down again.
00:42:31 And I took tons of train rides for free that way.
00:42:34 Ben, do you want to, as soon as this podcast is over,
00:42:37 go out and buy a can of beans and eat them with me?
00:42:42 Why?
00:42:42 Like a homeless man could be longer and lighter.
00:42:44 I have a sudden desire for beans because of what I'm talking about.
00:42:48 I'll just picture it.
00:42:49 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:42:49 Does this mean, does this mean that I get half a free can of beans?
00:42:53 Hell yeah.
00:42:59 My monthly tugboat has come in.
00:43:02 It's a date, Digi.
00:43:04 It's a fucking date.
00:43:07 I'm just picturing the guy on the train with the can of beans,
00:43:10 but the lid is still on and they're mostly open.
00:43:14 I'm like, yeah, yeah.
00:43:16 Who doesn't have a can opener so he uses a fucking rusty old knife he found?
00:43:21 Yeah.
00:43:21 It's a good look.
00:43:22 But are you guys aware, just while we're on the topic,
00:43:24 that I eat a can of dark red kidney beans out of a can for lunch every single day of my life?
00:43:30 Oh my God.
00:43:30 That's what I do.
00:43:31 Fucking yuck, dude.
00:43:32 Every single day.
00:43:32 Why?
00:43:33 Yeah, why?
00:43:33 Because it's high in protein, high in fiber.
00:43:36 Wait, wait, high in fiber.
00:43:38 Wait, fuck.
00:43:39 How's the song go?
00:43:39 High in fiber.
00:43:40 Low in fat.
00:43:40 Low in fat.
00:43:41 Hey, I bet you didn't know that when I eat beans.
00:43:45 I sit in my own little cloud.
00:43:48 Nobody comes to visit me in my little cloud.
00:43:52 I don't know why.
00:43:54 Maybe because I'm cut muffins.
00:43:55 Cut muffins.
00:43:56 Yep, that's a brag.
00:43:58 I do literally eat these beans though every single day.
00:44:00 Kibbe beans are good for you.
00:44:01 I prefer beans, beans, musical fruit, morey, morey too, morey too, belly fills,
00:44:09 eat two beans with every meal.
00:44:11 That's the normie one.
00:44:13 The brag show is better.
00:44:13 The normie one.
00:44:14 That's the normie's beans song.
00:44:16 It's a slightly, the specific version I'm doing is from Skull Monkeys.
00:44:19 You should all look up Skull Monkeys Beansong.
00:44:21 Oh, fucking Skull Monkeys.
00:44:24 Fucking Skull Monkeys.
00:44:26 Speaking of let's plays that haven't come out yet,
00:44:29 three hour Skull Monkeys let's play somewhere on Jesse's hard drive.
00:44:33 Oh god, where is it?
00:44:35 I want that.
00:44:36 Why isn't it out yet?
00:44:38 He's a bad person.
00:44:41 Who was telling the story?
00:44:42 Someone was guessing.
00:44:43 He was going to talk about going to a hotel and in a hand basket.
00:44:47 So I was 19 and I dropped out of college and wasn't doing anything with my life.
00:44:56 And my dad was like, we got to get this.
00:45:01 My dad essentially thought that maybe if I went and saw something new,
00:45:07 something that's not the house, you know, for a change,
00:45:10 maybe it would inspire me to like want to work or be a human being.
00:45:16 Clearly it didn't work.
00:45:18 So he knew that I had, yeah, it did not work at all.
00:45:22 Legit, it did not work in the way that it was supposed to.
00:45:25 But he knew that I had a friend in the Philippines, Ghost Lightning,
00:45:30 who's in his 30s and has a family and shit.
00:45:33 And he was like, that guy seems like he's got his shit together.
00:45:37 Why don't you go visit your friend in the Philippines?
00:45:39 And I was like, fucking, are you serious right now?
00:45:42 Dude, that's a half the planet away.
00:45:44 I've never really traveled anywhere before on my own.
00:45:49 I've never even gone to like a neighboring city without a person with me.
00:45:54 I'll tell you, one of the biggest reasons I don't travel is I hate going anywhere alone.
00:46:00 You can ask my friends, you can ask Ben and DeVue and Victor.
00:46:05 Those are the people who count at this point.
00:46:08 Like, when I want to go even just out of the house to get food,
00:46:12 I will always try to bring somebody with me.
00:46:15 I'm always like, hey, you want to go to Wendy's?
00:46:17 You want to go here?
00:46:18 You want to just be out with me?
00:46:21 Because so I'm not alone, you know?
00:46:24 I've gotten a lot more.
00:46:25 When did he comes out?
00:46:26 He needs someone to come out with.
00:46:27 Yeah, I've gotten a lot more used to.
00:46:29 Message received.
00:46:30 I've gotten a lot more used to going alone just because
00:46:33 now that I have money and nobody else does,
00:46:35 I want to go out a lot more than anyone else does.
00:46:37 So I've gotten used to going alone.
00:46:39 And that's why I'm going to travel now.
00:46:41 I'm willing to do it finally.
00:46:42 But at the time, I had never been anywhere by myself.
00:46:46 So I was like, this is the scariest prospect I've ever heard.
00:46:49 I'm going to a essentially third world country.
00:46:53 Like, they have, you know, they're not third world in the way that you might imagine,
00:46:58 but it's definitely not a first world nation.
00:47:00 Do you hear about their prime minister who like promotes vigilanteism
00:47:04 and like wants to personally beat up gangsters?
00:47:07 You mean their current leader who is murdering people in the streets
00:47:12 for accusations of drugs?
00:47:15 Like, right.
00:47:16 Just accusations.
00:47:17 Yeah.
00:47:18 Well, a man who he's got such a crackdown on he's got a massive,
00:47:22 like if you do anything involving drugs, you die.
00:47:25 And he's using this as a political power.
00:47:29 Like he can accuse his opponents of being drug, you know, drug cartels.
00:47:33 I bet his favorite video game is crack down.
00:47:36 Yeah.
00:47:37 Crack down.
00:47:38 Crack down.
00:47:39 The country is currently at, yeah, it's got a really corrupt.
00:47:42 That guy has compared himself to Hitler.
00:47:48 In a daring subversion of the typical trope.
00:47:52 Yeah.
00:47:53 He's compared himself to Hitler.
00:47:55 It's incredible.
00:47:55 Wow.
00:47:56 He's my hero.
00:47:56 Okay.
00:47:57 Moving on.
00:47:58 So he wasn't in power at this time.
00:48:00 So this is 2011.
00:48:03 And yeah.
00:48:05 So my dad's like, why don't you go see a friend of the Philippines?
00:48:07 And I was like, well, sure.
00:48:09 So I asked Ghost Lightning and he's like, well, that sounds cool as fuck.
00:48:12 So the plan is I'm going to go there for a whole month.
00:48:14 I'm going to live at Ghost Lightning's house
00:48:18 because the cost of living in the Philippines is dirt cheap compared to like, you know,
00:48:22 like American dollars will carry you obscenely far over there.
00:48:27 So the plan was that my dad was like the most expensive parts to fly.
00:48:32 It's like $1,000 just to fly there.
00:48:34 Right.
00:48:34 So my dad was like, all right, I'm going to give you, you know, the $1,000 to the flight,
00:48:38 $300 to give to Ghost Lightning as like a rent fair, you know, like to stay there for a whole month.
00:48:44 And then.
00:48:45 I love the rent fair.
00:48:46 Yeah.
00:48:47 He gave me, my dad had given me like, like $1,000 of you can spend this.
00:48:55 And then $1,000 of this is just in case, you know, in case anything is wrong.
00:49:00 So I was trying not to break into that thousand at all.
00:49:02 But the other thousand, the first thousand, you can spend this thousand.
00:49:06 I took, you can spend this to mean I will spend all of this.
00:49:12 Oh, absolutely.
00:49:13 Yeah.
00:49:13 So, um, so yeah, I took off to the Philippines and it was, it was, uh, look, I used to be,
00:49:22 I mean, if you think I'm awkward and, uh, and, and weird now, I used to be exceedingly
00:49:30 socially awkward to the point that I made very stupid decisions based on it.
00:49:35 So for instance, Ghost Lightning had given me his phone number online.
00:49:40 I foolishly had not attempted to call that number to make sure I had it correctly.
00:49:46 I never, because I just thought like, oh, I don't want to bother him.
00:49:50 You know, like, I don't know what time of day he's awake.
00:49:52 And basically I'm afraid of phones, you know, I would just never, I was like terrified of
00:49:56 calling anybody and having to talk on the phone.
00:49:59 So I remember to this day, people always ask me to make phone calls.
00:50:02 Yeah.
00:50:02 When there's a phone call to be made.
00:50:04 Exactly.
00:50:05 So, so yeah, I just, I was like, oh God, I don't want to have the call.
00:50:09 But then so, all right.
00:50:11 So I get on a plane, uh, I think I flew to probably like Detroit or something.
00:50:17 So one of those flights, one of those, uh, cities that you always had the layovers from.
00:50:21 And then from there, I flew to Japan, which was like a 14, 15, maybe more hour flight.
00:50:28 As long as the total trip, this was crazy because the total time that I was in the air was, uh,
00:50:36 like, yeah, I think it was that I was in the air for 14 hours.
00:50:40 But then because it's 10 hours ahead of us in the Philippines,
00:50:45 it had been like exactly 24 hours from the time I left that I arrived.
00:50:49 So like I traveled into the future.
00:50:51 But, um, but in any case, so I took this, this longest flight to Japan.
00:50:57 And then I was in Japan for like an hour.
00:51:00 I've been there.
00:51:00 I can say that I was in a moment, a brief moment in the Holy land before going straight down to hell.
00:51:07 I gotta tell you, man, like, I think this, this could be,
00:51:12 this could surely be my, uh, my Baka Gaijin, uh, talking here.
00:51:18 But like people always say that when you go to Japan, like people who go there,
00:51:24 like it's never what they expect.
00:51:26 Like, uh, oh, the, the, uh, you know, the women aren't as beautiful as anime characters.
00:51:32 And, and it's not like how you're thinking and stuff like that.
00:51:35 Yeah. Well, maybe because I've watched a lot of Japanese TV and travel blogs and stuff,
00:51:40 but man, in the short time I was there, it was exactly what I thought Japan is like.
00:51:45 I was like, yeah, this is a thorough understanding of the Japanese culture from inside the airport
00:51:50 for one hour.
00:51:51 Yeah. I mean, every, all the ways that things are laid out, the ways that their PA system
00:51:57 works, extremely organized, um, you know, constant updates on what is happening meticulously
00:52:04 everywhere in the airport, you know, tons and tons of signs, informing you of everything.
00:52:09 Also, all of the flight attendants, like everyone who, who's like, uh, you know,
00:52:15 telling people, like calling out names to get on the plane, stuff like that,
00:52:18 all beautiful women, all of them.
00:52:21 You know, I, I noticed a, uh, when I flew to Japan, there was a very,
00:52:25 they were all very nice and very well put together.
00:52:28 Yeah.
00:52:28 Just distinctly, definitely several notches above the other flights I've taken in like domestic
00:52:33 cruise and shit.
00:52:34 Like you go, I go to the airport, I expect the person calling me up to be like some,
00:52:39 you know, 10 out of 10 anime babe, you know, some, some, you know, fat, fat old black lady
00:52:44 or something, uh, is that my go-to for unappealing person?
00:52:49 Sure.
00:52:50 We got, we got a real John Tron over here.
00:52:55 And then I go to Japan and it's all like, you know, like very, very well dressed,
00:53:02 hair perfectly parted in a ponytail, um, like all, they all look identical.
00:53:08 And I don't mean that in the all Asians look the same way.
00:53:11 I mean, they were all dressed and had their hair in the same style.
00:53:14 And like, it was just all like late 20, early 30s, Japanese women with the same hairstyle.
00:53:23 And they were all beautiful.
00:53:24 So yeah, that's, that's Japan in my mind now.
00:53:27 Ladies, you heard it here from Digi Bro.
00:53:29 You're all beautiful.
00:53:32 Yeah.
00:53:32 Scarcely beautiful.
00:53:33 You know, I'm just, I'm just saying that, uh, it is not a difficult job to be a flight attendant.
00:53:37 I'm sure it's got its own challenges, but like the most important thing is that you
00:53:40 look good and consistent with the airline's way it wants to present itself.
00:53:45 So, uh, put some effort into that guys.
00:53:47 Hey Nate, didn't you like go to Japan, like travel there?
00:53:51 I sure did.
00:53:52 Spent two, three months there.
00:53:54 You're not on Nate's stories yet.
00:53:56 Yeah, we can talk about that later.
00:53:57 There's not.
00:53:57 Why are you trying to co-op?
00:53:58 Why are you trying to cut into my story to hear Nate's?
00:54:01 I thought you were done.
00:54:02 I'm only in Japan at this point.
00:54:05 You've only gone to Japan.
00:54:06 Well, he hasn't reached hell yet.
00:54:08 Yeah.
00:54:09 Yeah.
00:54:09 So then it's like a, it's like a hour or two flight from Japan to the Philippines, pretty short.
00:54:15 And so I get there and yeah, hell, good way to describe the airport in the fucking Philippines,
00:54:21 because yeah, just like what monkey said about customs, it's basically a fucking long ass line
00:54:27 to get up to a guy in a glass window, uh, with a very curt attitude who interviews you.
00:54:33 And the guy, like I'm telling him, you know, I'm going to be here for a month.
00:54:39 And he's like, well, like how can you be here for a month if you're like, like,
00:54:44 if you're not going to have, if you're not going to be working, essentially.
00:54:47 Like he was, he was basically trying to badger me about like he thinks, I don't know,
00:54:50 maybe he thinks I'm here to do something illegal.
00:54:52 But he's like,
00:54:52 Is that beard, man?
00:54:53 Is that beard terrorist written all over it?
00:54:55 So for whatever reason, he gives me, he's like, I'll mark you for three weeks
00:55:01 and you can come back and have you stay extended.
00:55:07 And I'm like, uh, okay.
00:55:10 You know, like I can't, I'm trying to argue with this guy, but it's, he's, he's just
00:55:13 being a total asshole, right?
00:55:15 So yeah, I get through him, get into customs, get, uh, thank God, I don't even bother.
00:55:20 Whenever I travel, I only, only carry on.
00:55:24 No, not carry on luggage.
00:55:27 I can, I'm a master of packing things, you know, uh, all that butt sex and mostly 18
00:55:34 times moving the house.
00:55:35 I know how to pack shit tight.
00:55:37 So, uh, so yeah, I've got, I've got all my shit.
00:55:41 And I, um, I get off the plane and I go out, I go out, you know, it's
00:55:48 monkey, you'll appreciate this.
00:55:50 I don't think anybody else will.
00:55:51 But in the proto men's song, uh, bring us the rope.
00:55:55 That moment where you hear the, the, the doors open of the, uh, of the courthouse
00:56:01 and it's like,
00:56:06 you just hear like an army of people outside chanting and they're all, that's what it felt
00:56:09 like walking out of the airport.
00:56:11 There's just an endless ocean of humanity.
00:56:14 It's just people everywhere.
00:56:17 And like, so the idea is, you know, like any other airport, there's just like a
00:56:21 couple of lanes of cars that are coming in to pick people up, but it's like almost
00:56:25 all cabs and there's like hundreds of them and it just goes on and on.
00:56:29 And there's just endless sea of people.
00:56:31 And I, of course, I'm, I mean, I'm already late.
00:56:35 Like I'm supposed to have been there like 30 minutes ago.
00:56:38 Ghost lightning has, I don't know this yet, but he has a cab waiting for us.
00:56:43 And they're, you know, they're going to be charging a lot.
00:56:46 Like I don't know what he paid for that cab, but I know it was probably a, like a
00:56:51 deafening amount of money.
00:56:52 You know, I'm going to kind of put that on him because planes are unreliable.
00:56:56 And like if there's so many cabs, you should be able to just get one.
00:56:59 Well, I mean, I'm already like 20, 30 minutes late, but now I'm about to be
00:57:04 another 40 minutes late because I'm trying to call this guy.
00:57:09 And of course I have his number wrong and I'm trying to find him in an endless sea
00:57:15 of people.
00:57:16 And neither of us knows where the other is supposed to be.
00:57:19 He can't even really know if I've landed yet because I have had no real way of
00:57:23 contacting him this whole time I've been traveling.
00:57:26 You know, I've, I'm on like, I think I'm on like an old flip phone.
00:57:31 No, my dad let me bring an iPhone one.
00:57:34 I didn't have my own cell phone at the time.
00:57:35 So I brought like my mom's old phone or something like that.
00:57:39 So I'm trying to like, you know, figure out what to do with this number.
00:57:44 And I can't get like Wi-Fi reception or anything.
00:57:47 So I'm like freaking out.
00:57:49 I'm like, what the fuck do I do?
00:57:50 You know, I'm wandering around for like 40 minutes.
00:57:52 Finally, it occurs to me to try to send an email to him.
00:57:56 So I am able to get just the faintest connection like a, it loads for like a
00:58:02 straight minute to get into, you know, anything.
00:58:05 And I send him an email that's just like, you know, I'm here, but I have your number
00:58:09 wrong or something like that.
00:58:11 And he says to me like, he sends me one that's like gate 13.
00:58:16 I'm wearing a Mazinger t-shirt.
00:58:18 And so eventually I did find him.
00:58:22 And yeah, it was a nightmare.
00:58:23 So, and then he was hoping you were going to say that like the only way that you
00:58:27 ended up able to communicate with him was you had to really quick do an anime
00:58:30 analysis and post it to your blog to convey the information of where you currently were.
00:58:35 And he had to like decode it.
00:58:37 Like the first letter of each word said what gate he was at.
00:58:40 I'm pretty sure Twitter existed at the time.
00:58:44 But so, so, yeah.
00:58:46 So, and then the other thing is like in the Philippines, and I suspect this is
00:58:50 true of, I mean, this is true of some places in America, but it's definitely true of
00:58:55 other countries.
00:58:56 There's just constant people hustling everywhere.
00:59:00 So one of the things that down there is that they'll have guys who just like at
00:59:04 that area who are just constantly offering to take your bags.
00:59:07 Like they'll like they'll carry it to the car for you.
00:59:10 You know, like, oh, let me, let me, let me.
00:59:12 And so I, of course, I let some guy and we carry him out to the car and then go
00:59:16 slightly.
00:59:16 He's like, you got to tip that guy.
00:59:18 You know, I'm like, of course I do.
00:59:20 Like I didn't even think about it.
00:59:21 Like I just think in these guys work for the airport.
00:59:24 And it's like, no, these guys are, they're doing this for tips.
00:59:27 You know, so I tip him probably something too much because I didn't have my bills
00:59:31 broken down far enough.
00:59:32 That's when you turn to him and say, here's the tip.
00:59:34 Get a real job hippie.
00:59:37 They pull out their knife and I think I probably had to pay him an American
00:59:40 dollars because I hadn't converted my money yet to there.
00:59:43 So I don't know what it was worth to him.
00:59:45 It might have been worth nothing.
00:59:46 You know, so, uh, so I stayed in the Philippines for a month.
00:59:50 It was a good time.
00:59:51 Um, so the travel back as Bumky said, also gigantic pain in the ass.
00:59:57 So of course you remember that guy who gave me the three weeks and said, come back.
01:00:02 You know, I didn't come back.
01:00:03 You know, I just come back to do that.
01:00:05 So, so, uh, go sighting drops me off at the airport.
01:00:09 It's like six in the morning.
01:00:09 Where does that guy even get off?
01:00:10 What is he like?
01:00:11 Why do these fucking people at the customs want to fuck with you so bad?
01:00:15 I don't know.
01:00:16 Do they think that we're actually terrorists?
01:00:17 Like you were joking.
01:00:18 Well, all right, what is their mindset?
01:00:21 What's the difference between three weeks and a month?
01:00:23 You know, I don't know what that kind of nitpick.
01:00:26 I do not understand because it seems very insignificant.
01:00:28 Like you just want to fuck with you, but they are trying to like minimize threat
01:00:32 levels.
01:00:32 I mean, I really don't know what goes into constituting that.
01:00:35 But something like what I didn't understand about it is that like I had my return ticket.
01:00:41 It's not like I was, you know, getting a one-way trip and I was saying a month
01:00:46 and then I would just never go back.
01:00:47 I'm going to come leech off your fucking country.
01:00:50 Yeah, I have a fucking ticket.
01:00:51 You retard.
01:00:52 What do you want from me?
01:00:53 That's exactly the weird thing is you have the return to go home after three weeks.
01:00:57 I have no idea.
01:00:58 He just wanted me to come back to the airport all the way the fuck across town,
01:01:03 you know, and go through security again to go talk to him in a little glass booth at customs.
01:01:09 And may I remind you that and this is the biggest problem of my trip to the Philippines.
01:01:15 In the universe.
01:01:15 I had a good time there, but I did not do it right because as I'll remind you,
01:01:22 I had never been traveling before and I hated to go anywhere alone.
01:01:26 And no one there speaks English unless you're in like a rich area.
01:01:32 So like, you know, I think they speak in the Philippines.
01:01:35 Ghost Lightning would try to like this to Gallag is what it's called.
01:01:39 And he would try to teach me like basic enough to Gallag that I could like,
01:01:43 you know, figure out prices of things and take public transit because we mostly took public transit.
01:01:49 Though they had like a house driver, like a guy.
01:01:53 I think it was like, I think it was like his wife's uncle or something who like would just wife's boyfriend.
01:01:59 No, his wife's uncle who would just like drive like his,
01:02:04 they would just pay him to be around with a car to drive members of the family,
01:02:08 wherever they needed to go around town.
01:02:09 That's the cool thing about less than first world nations.
01:02:12 You got you got shit like that going on.
01:02:14 You just have lots of cool stuff.
01:02:15 It's pretty cool.
01:02:15 They had a bunch of house servants and stuff like that's pretty dope.
01:02:19 Like who but yeah, that was my favorite because what he would do is he would like,
01:02:25 like, you know, we'd be let's go to the mall and he just like drop us off in front of the mall
01:02:29 and then he'd go find parking, you know, and then he just kind of like hang out in the parking lot
01:02:34 until we were done and we'd like text him and he'd come and pick us up in front of the mall.
01:02:38 There's not enough focus put on the suffering we as Americans endure by not having personal
01:02:42 drivers. That's a big it's pretty cool.
01:02:44 I would love to have one.
01:02:45 But it's that's the thing to pay someone a livable wage in America wouldn't be worth it.
01:02:52 Thanks for that $15 minimum wage, Bernie motherfucker.
01:02:56 So, I mean, you could probably pay Ben in leftovers to drive you around.
01:03:02 It would be my honor, sir.
01:03:06 I don't know what Ben when Ben's job and never really brings him in contact with a dumpster,
01:03:10 you know, jump from him.
01:03:11 He's going to jump from that job pretty quick.
01:03:13 He can't be trusted.
01:03:14 I see I'll go and go where the money is in the dumpster.
01:03:19 I'm driving and he's catches a dumpster out of the fucking driver's
01:03:25 slams of the brakes and he's like, doggy, I got a I got a gold rush today.
01:03:31 So anyways, the homeless warrior.
01:03:33 Yeah.
01:03:34 So yeah, I didn't I did not go out much and like go sighting was always encouraging me like,
01:03:39 you know, when I'm not because, you know, he was working.
01:03:42 So he's like, when I'm not around, you should go out and go to the mall or go to go to the
01:03:48 fucking airport and get your shit figured out with three weeks.
01:03:51 They, you know, go somewhere.
01:03:52 I never went anywhere unless either him or his wife was with me.
01:03:56 You know, like I would exclusively go places with them except for one time that I walked
01:04:02 a couple miles to Jollibee and ate Jollibee Jollibee is the Philippines equivalent of
01:04:09 McDonald's.
01:04:10 I mean, they have McDonald's everywhere.
01:04:12 But basically McDonald's took too long to come to the Philippines.
01:04:16 So they made their own fast food chain.
01:04:19 I mean, KFC is huge there.
01:04:20 They KFC was like the first to go everywhere.
01:04:22 They they they they franchised around the world early, which is why the rest of the world
01:04:26 likes them and we don't give a fuck.
01:04:28 But Jollibee was one they made up themselves and like the Philippines has a very, very
01:04:34 interesting set of fast food regulars that they that they have their go-tos because they've
01:04:41 got burgers with with like white cheese and tons of mayonnaise, which just seems to be
01:04:46 an Asia thing in general.
01:04:48 Then they've got fried chicken and spaghetti.
01:04:53 And like spaghetti jets.
01:04:56 The Jollibee when you go to Jollibee, it's it's you got your bird.
01:04:59 You got like two kinds of burger like the small big burger.
01:05:02 Then you've got the like three to five drumstick fried chicken and then you've got spaghetti.
01:05:07 And then if you go to McDonald's, they also serve spaghetti.
01:05:12 So that's awesome.
01:05:13 Like everywhere there is like those are the three staples of fast food.
01:05:16 Burger, fried chicken, spaghetti.
01:05:18 So yeah, I walked to Jollibee one time.
01:05:20 Do they have fried chicken and McDonald's?
01:05:21 Um, I don't know if they have on the bone fried chicken there, but they have.
01:05:24 I mean, McDonald's has, you know, they had chicken fries and selection shit at the time.
01:05:29 Like a drum drum leg or whatever the fuck it's called.
01:05:32 I don't think they have those at McDonald's.
01:05:34 Drumstick, that's right.
01:05:35 But they did have spaghetti.
01:05:37 So anyway, I want to try McDonald's spaghetti.
01:05:39 That sounds amazing.
01:05:40 Yeah.
01:05:40 You know, when I moved out to Cincinnati, I just noticed like chili is the thing that
01:05:44 appeared in every restaurant and they're like gold star chili is like as big as I
01:05:48 don't know Dunkin Donuts out here.
01:05:49 Another thing to realize is that McDonald's is a little bit more upscale there because
01:05:54 they charge the same prices that they would in America, but that's vastly more there.
01:06:00 That's what it was like in Lublin too.
01:06:02 There was a McDonald's.
01:06:02 Same with Japan.
01:06:03 Same with Japan.
01:06:04 There was a McDonald's and it was the food was the same, but they charge the same as in
01:06:09 America and therefore it was pretty fucking expensive.
01:06:12 I thought it was real quick and they charge the same as it was in America and therefore
01:06:15 it was kind of like a relatively upscale restaurant.
01:06:18 It was like right in the center of the fucking city and it was a rather fascinating phenomenon.
01:06:22 The fact that America has a more economically strong position means that like by exporting
01:06:30 what's an equivalent price point outside of America, they all kind of get a nicer
01:06:35 version of that shit than we get relatively speaking.
01:06:38 That reminds me that in Latvia, when I stopped in Latvia on the way to Estonia,
01:06:44 I got off the train and I walked around and I ate some fucking gummy jelly shit that was in
01:06:48 some candy shop and that was great.
01:06:50 But I also went to a McDonald's and in this McDonald's in Riga, Latvia,
01:06:55 there was like a super nicely laid out thing with like this fancy fucking dessert tray,
01:06:59 this fancy dessert rack with all these like fancy cheesecakes in it and stuff.
01:07:03 And I went and I fucking, I ordered my burger and the manager fucking brought the burger out
01:07:08 to me and he was in like a nice smart like tie and he like sat the burger down in front of me
01:07:13 and like smoothed down the little napkin and was like, please enjoy your burger, sir.
01:07:17 Got it.
01:07:17 And I said, and I said, nothing, I didn't care.
01:07:21 And I said, your people are what's ruining my country.
01:07:23 I said, patreon.com.
01:07:29 They had some like two story McDonald's in the Philippines and just like these gigantic and
01:07:33 yeah, a little bit a little bit fancier, not like super fancy, but whereas pizza hut for
01:07:39 some reason, extremely fancy because also they charge the same prices here.
01:07:42 So the equivalent of like, if you just bought a pizza in the Philippines, you're basically
01:07:48 spending the equivalent of $25 on it.
01:07:50 So, you know, did you just jog by memory?
01:07:53 The McDonald's I went to in Argentina had like cheesecake and shit, like a bunch of random
01:07:58 fancy stuff.
01:07:58 Yeah, yeah.
01:07:59 The one in Latvia had the cheese.
01:08:00 So, so anyways, so, so for my travel backstory from the Philippines, I of course have not
01:08:07 adjusted this three weeks thing.
01:08:08 I've stayed a whole month and I have not done anything about it.
01:08:12 So ghost lightning drops me off at the airport.
01:08:14 It's like six a.m.
01:08:16 My flight is at like seven or so.
01:08:19 Oh, that's a bad move.
01:08:21 Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not I'm not it probably wasn't that close.
01:08:24 But like what matters is that it's early in the morning.
01:08:27 That's the detail you need to know.
01:08:29 So I go in and I'm like, you know, I'm at the flight desk and they're like, well,
01:08:34 you only had three weeks that you were allowed to be here.
01:08:38 So we're going to charge you like a fee, right?
01:08:42 Of like $80, which was a lot.
01:08:47 It's not that bad.
01:08:48 Right.
01:08:48 I'm sure it could have been worse.
01:08:49 But I was like mother because, you know, I've already spent in the time I'm in the Philippines.
01:08:54 I spend hundreds of dollars on anime bullshit.
01:08:58 Like a significant amount of all the figures and shit that you see in my videos are bought
01:09:04 in the Philippines because they're way cheaper there and they had way more variety because
01:09:08 not only do they have tons of bootlegs, but there's there's just tons of toy stores there.
01:09:13 Like if you go into a mall, there will be several stores that are just anime toy stores.
01:09:19 And even Toys R Us there has tons of anime shit because they're, you know,
01:09:23 they're close to Japan.
01:09:24 They have lots of anime on TV.
01:09:25 They've got Animax Asia and shit like that.
01:09:28 So, you know, I would walk into a Toys R Us and they got Gintama toys and for cheap.
01:09:35 So I'd buy them everywhere.
01:09:36 So I had my backpack was totally full of toys because again, I only do carry on.
01:09:41 And so I just took like everything I bought, I just took it out of the box and put it in
01:09:46 the backpack like individually and then and left all the boxes at Ghost Lightning's house.
01:09:51 I assume he threw them away.
01:09:53 I had said something about like getting him to ship them to me.
01:09:56 I don't know why I thought I would do that, but he probably threw them away a long time ago.
01:10:00 So, or immediately rather.
01:10:02 So yeah, I have all these anime toys and shit in my in my backpack.
01:10:08 And then I, yeah, I'm at the airport and they're like, you have to pay a fee.
01:10:13 So I'm like, fuck, I have to.
01:10:17 Okay.
01:10:17 I think this is why it was an issue is that I didn't have enough Filipino money left to pay this fee.
01:10:26 I only had like I had already run through all like because the way I was getting Filipino
01:10:31 money is I had all these these like conversion checks.
01:10:34 Like my dad had written me all these checks where basically you go to the bank.
01:10:38 Yeah, cashier's checks where you go to the bank.
01:10:40 You sign in front like you have one signature that's already on there.
01:10:43 And then you sign again and like at the bank and then they they exchange it for cash.
01:10:50 So I mostly had a bunch of these checks and
01:10:55 and I had like some American money and some Filipino money that I had cash,
01:10:59 but I had several unchecked like uncashed checks, but I couldn't do anything with them.
01:11:03 Right.
01:11:04 And it was funny when I went to do that, when I went to sign the second time at the bank,
01:11:10 because my signature is so fucking inconsistent, the lady was like really confused when I signed
01:11:15 them and she was like, I need you to duplicate your original signature and then duplicate this one
01:11:21 for me.
01:11:21 And I did that as best I could.
01:11:24 So so yeah, so so I'm like, fuck, the only way I'm going to be able to afford this,
01:11:28 because they wouldn't take my American money.
01:11:29 They were like, you need more Filipino money.
01:11:31 So I was like, well, I've got a couple of these checks left.
01:11:34 There's a bank in the airport.
01:11:36 It's closed and it doesn't open till 8am.
01:11:40 Which is after my flight.
01:11:41 Oh, fuck, right.
01:11:42 So I don't have anything.
01:11:44 So I'm freaking out.
01:11:46 And then a police officer who's nearby is like, hey, look, I'll make this exchange for you.
01:11:52 I'll give you Filipino money in exchange for American money.
01:11:56 And I think it was that maybe it was that it.
01:12:00 Yeah, I think it was that it was like 80 bucks is what I needed.
01:12:03 But I only had like 50s on me or something.
01:12:06 I only had $100 for some reason in American money.
01:12:10 So I just gave it to I was like, you know, he gave me the equivalent of 80.
01:12:14 And I gave him 100.
01:12:15 He was like, are you sure, man?
01:12:16 And I was like, I have no choice.
01:12:18 This is all I have.
01:12:19 I need my flight to 10 minutes, you know.
01:12:22 That remind one time I was I was one quarter short of being able to do my fucking laundry.
01:12:28 So I went wandering around the streets and just found a guy.
01:12:31 Like it was like the midnight so nothing was open.
01:12:34 But I found at the back of the local Little Caesars Pizza, there were people cleaning up.
01:12:39 And I just I walked in to the back of the restaurant after they were close and said,
01:12:43 can someone please give me a quarter?
01:12:46 And I just I gave a guy $5 for one quarter.
01:12:49 Oh my god, you could have got a hot ready pizza for that five.
01:12:56 They didn't have coin converters in the laundry mat.
01:13:00 Dude, I don't use a laundry mat like there's a machine in my basement.
01:13:04 Uses quarters because I'm getting fucking scammed every day of my life.
01:13:06 But yeah, like it's it's a nightmare actually getting those getting the courts to that.
01:13:11 I have to go to the bank and shit fucked up to stop washing your clothes.
01:13:15 I'm doing that.
01:13:15 I'm trying that.
01:13:16 So so yeah, so so I get I finally I get the money I get through and then I fly to I think
01:13:23 I don't think I had to stop in Japan on the way back.
01:13:24 I think it was just a straight flight to America.
01:13:26 But this time it's another customs fuckery situation where like I land in the U.S.
01:13:33 with like maybe like 45 to 50 minutes to get to the next flight.
01:13:39 Right.
01:13:39 So this is this is going to be cutting it close no matter what.
01:13:42 And it's a long ass line in customs.
01:13:44 But we're going through pretty quick.
01:13:45 Now what's amazing about this is that like everyone else on the flight I'm with is like
01:13:49 Filipino.
01:13:50 You know, I'm like like one of the only white guys.
01:13:52 Everyone else is going through.
01:13:53 They've got this left lane.
01:13:55 Every guy's just like looking at him going.
01:13:56 Oh yeah, go go go ahead.
01:13:58 I get selected.
01:14:00 I get pulled aside to this.
01:14:04 This other room where this this other guy who is another Filipino guy.
01:14:09 But they've there's these two dudes, these two like security guys who are running, you
01:14:14 know, running through this guy's shit.
01:14:15 And they're taking forever.
01:14:17 They're like talking to the guy and shit.
01:14:19 They're doing all this stuff and I'm looking over.
01:14:21 I'm watching that other line just mosey on through constant stream of people and I'm
01:14:26 checking my phone like like by the time these guys even start looking at my shit,
01:14:30 I'm going to be fucking late.
01:14:32 Right.
01:14:32 So like they finally get that guy up and then they're going through my shit.
01:14:36 And these guys seem like total dick bags.
01:14:39 Like they've they've both got.
01:14:40 I think that's a requirement for working at an airport.
01:14:43 Have any of you seen the wire?
01:14:46 Nope.
01:14:48 Nobody.
01:14:49 I've seen some of it.
01:14:50 I know officer money penny or whatever.
01:14:53 Hey penny from San Andreas.
01:14:55 That's not helpful.
01:14:58 I know there's a black guy who likes chess.
01:15:01 There's these two asshole cops in the show.
01:15:02 And that's what these guys reminded me of.
01:15:04 Just like they had like this the attitude of like like like like like the jock cop is
01:15:10 the kind of guys I'm talking about.
01:15:11 You know, like Ben St was the cop.
01:15:15 No, the opposite.
01:15:15 It's the big old jock.
01:15:17 Tough guy.
01:15:18 Yeah, yeah.
01:15:19 It's these two guys who are like, you know, they clearly throw their weight around,
01:15:25 even though they're just like security officers or whatever.
01:15:27 That's me.
01:15:28 So they, of course, they open up my shit.
01:15:30 They're going through all my stuff and they're not even very thorough.
01:15:33 They're just kind of like looking at my stuff.
01:15:35 And of course my fucking suitcase is just full of anime crap.
01:15:38 So they're like flipping through my fucking gunslinger girl books and stuff.
01:15:42 And like I had bought this.
01:15:46 I'd bought like a 20 like every character from a certain scientific railgun because
01:15:50 they had these like little mini figures and they you could buy them in like a set.
01:15:54 And there's like 10 of them.
01:15:56 So they're like opening up the little boxes and look at the like.
01:15:59 So what are these for?
01:16:01 I'm like, they're they're toys.
01:16:03 They're he's like, yeah, what are they?
01:16:05 What are they for?
01:16:05 What are you going to do with them?
01:16:06 You piece of shit.
01:16:07 They're collectibles.
01:16:08 So what the fuck do you mean?
01:16:09 And he's it's like they I was like, you know, I'm probably going to give some to friends.
01:16:15 I don't know, man.
01:16:16 Like because I gave half of them to shade.
01:16:18 It was just like, I don't I don't fucking know.
01:16:20 What do you mean?
01:16:21 What are they?
01:16:21 They're fucking toys.
01:16:22 What do they look like?
01:16:24 Can't you see that I'm a fucking weird pedophile?
01:16:30 Because this is I've got the you know, this is when I've got the super long hair all the way down
01:16:34 to my ass.
01:16:35 That's all frazzled and fucked up because I don't take care of it.
01:16:38 I've got the shitty fucking goatee.
01:16:41 So I'm I'm a hideous monstrosity.
01:16:44 You know, I am obviously a gross pedophile terrorist.
01:16:49 So like can't they just like it's like, are you going to arrest me or not?
01:16:53 You know, like nothing in that bag is incriminating because I'm not retarded.
01:16:57 So either arrest me because I'm clearly a bad guy or just let me through, you know, whatever.
01:17:03 So I managed to I actually managed to make the flight with like seconds to spare.
01:17:08 Like I ran across the whole airport.
01:17:12 You know, I'm I'm out of shape.
01:17:13 So I show up like winded my legs are burning and shit.
01:17:16 Like I ran across the whole fucking Chicago airport or whichever one the one of the big ones.
01:17:24 Yeah.
01:17:24 And I guess that's basically the end of the travel story.
01:17:28 Oh, what a journey.
01:17:29 What an odyssey it was.
01:17:31 Customs people should all be like fucking hanged.
01:17:34 Yeah.
01:17:35 You know, I've got I've got I have a positive story about the customs people.
01:17:39 Oh, no, you don't.
01:17:40 I do.
01:17:41 Shocking and unforgivable.
01:17:43 What did you have sex with?
01:17:44 Like a cute little Japanese woman and you had sex with her or something.
01:17:47 Yeah.
01:17:47 I mean, all I had to do is take her out of my suitcase and let him fuck her.
01:17:49 And then he let us go through.
01:17:50 So it was pretty good.
01:17:53 You know, it was worth it for my investment.
01:17:56 Okay.
01:17:56 So I mean, I'll go with your mind real quick.
01:17:59 That was such a weird reversal on what I think monkey meant.
01:18:04 Maybe I misunderstood.
01:18:07 He was implied that you had sex with the customs lady.
01:18:11 You seem to imply that you had a Japanese lady with you who had sex with the customs guy.
01:18:17 In my suitcase, I guess I've been like forming this idea in my head.
01:18:20 Listen, you guys tell travel stories like you're a pedophile.
01:18:23 They're examining what's in your bag.
01:18:24 There's a little girl in there.
01:18:25 You know, some, some like that.
01:18:27 It all comes together.
01:18:28 Yeah.
01:18:29 So, so, okay.
01:18:30 So the most interesting travel I've done was when I visited Japan for two months before my
01:18:37 senior year of college when I was studying Japanese and at school at the College of New Jersey.
01:18:42 And that was by far, yeah, it was pretty nerdy.
01:18:47 The best thing it was, it was the best thing about college without a doubt other than meeting
01:18:51 my friends, which, which was good.
01:18:53 But, but this trip was, was the best.
01:18:56 It was, it was the best thing I've done in my life.
01:18:59 So, the trip there was actually great.
01:19:01 I mean, I was lucky that, yeah, like my parents helped me pay for the trip.
01:19:05 I couldn't have done it on my own.
01:19:07 And I got a bunch of cashier's check, got all my shit together, packed my bag,
01:19:11 packed all my anime shirts to wear what the people in Japan wear and got on the plane and
01:19:17 and just got out there.
01:19:18 And then the flight out there was, was pretty, pretty great.
01:19:21 Can't really complain.
01:19:22 I think it was from Logan Airport in Boston.
01:19:24 And I think there wasn't a stopover.
01:19:27 I think it was like a one shot.
01:19:28 I could be wrong about that.
01:19:29 But in any case, the flight to Japan was lovely.
01:19:32 It was like the best airplane food I've ever had.
01:19:34 I had like a fucking meal and it was like, it was like comfortable.
01:19:39 Yeah, please.
01:19:42 And the air ladies were great.
01:19:44 It was, it was wonderful.
01:19:46 And so, so I was living there, going to go into this school.
01:19:49 I actually looked it up while you guys were talking.
01:19:51 It's KCP International.
01:19:54 So it's like the PCP only with a K for Japan.
01:19:58 And also international.
01:20:00 Yeah, and also that.
01:20:02 So that place was great.
01:20:04 It was this, this cool ass school.
01:20:06 Wait, the PCP is international.
01:20:08 We have hippo and mage.
01:20:10 Oh, yeah, yeah.
01:20:11 That's true.
01:20:11 Fuck you, Ben.
01:20:12 You're not international.
01:20:13 I'm made of real countries.
01:20:15 Wait, international doesn't just mean Japanese.
01:20:17 I don't understand that.
01:20:18 Not anymore.
01:20:19 Unfortunately not.
01:20:21 You learn something new every day.
01:20:23 Well, not if you're me.
01:20:29 The mind of a homeless man is a closed book.
01:20:32 There's nothing new entering or leaving it.
01:20:36 So I have a closed book.
01:20:39 I'm washed up.
01:20:41 I'm set in my ways.
01:20:45 So I don't have much to say about that.
01:20:47 I mean, it was just a school.
01:20:48 There was a bunch of Koreans.
01:20:50 It was mostly Koreans, probably half Koreans.
01:20:52 Then a bunch of weeby Americans
01:20:54 and a couple of British people and shit.
01:20:55 They were all cool.
01:20:57 But what was interesting about it was
01:20:59 I noticed where my money went while I was there.
01:21:01 Because I spent an ungodly amount of money there as well.
01:21:05 I bought like one thing I was really looking forward to
01:21:08 was that I'd never been satisfied
01:21:11 with the selection of one piece shirts.
01:21:14 Well, that too.
01:21:14 I did try to get laid extensively in Japan.
01:21:16 That was probably the number two thing
01:21:19 that I engaged in while I was there.
01:21:22 But right.
01:21:24 So I was trying to find one piece shirts.
01:21:26 And I was online one day and found this ad.
01:21:28 I just found a magazine that had ad for one piece shirts
01:21:31 from Uniqlo.
01:21:32 And they just had fucking one piece shirts.
01:21:34 So it was a big day trip.
01:21:35 I dragged a couple people out.
01:21:37 We went to Uniqlo.
01:21:38 Were you a day tripper?
01:21:40 Yes.
01:21:42 Yes.
01:21:42 Good joke.
01:21:43 Thank you.
01:21:43 Thank you.
01:21:44 Thank you.
01:21:45 I found the promised land of one piece shirts in this Uniqlo.
01:21:49 And I bought them and it was good.
01:21:51 It was actually fun.
01:21:51 I did that like early on in my trip.
01:21:53 But later on when I just like started,
01:21:55 when I figured out how to wander on Akihabara and shit,
01:21:59 like there was more to be found.
01:22:02 Just like on the street everywhere.
01:22:04 Well, okay, I'm exaggerating.
01:22:05 But like in like the clothing districts and shit,
01:22:07 in like the shopping centers,
01:22:08 there was just tons of one piece shit.
01:22:10 Because Japan gets it.
01:22:12 Japan understands that nothing else matters except one piece.
01:22:15 So aside from just like buying that shit,
01:22:19 my money was divided up between like bar tabs,
01:22:25 you know, buying alcohol, going to food places,
01:22:29 like the McDonald's we'd go to after being out all night,
01:22:32 trying to get laid in Roppongi.
01:22:34 Roppongi was the place we went,
01:22:35 like the club district, me and a couple of friends from school.
01:22:40 We'd go there and my money was consumed by that.
01:22:42 But then more interestingly,
01:22:44 I spent a lot of time at both crane machine arcades
01:22:47 and just like straight up game arcades in general.
01:22:50 Because there was this game that I was already really into,
01:22:53 Project Diva, the, you know, the fucking Hatsune Miku,
01:22:58 you know, rhythm game.
01:22:59 And that game was hot at this time.
01:23:02 I think this was like 2000, it is awesome.
01:23:04 It was fucking great.
01:23:05 And they had these arcade booths
01:23:07 where people would be lined up around the fucking block
01:23:09 to sign up and play fucking Project Diva.
01:23:12 And I would play Megurini Luca.
01:23:15 I can't remember what fucking song.
01:23:16 I had like one song I was pretty good at.
01:23:18 But these guys were masters.
01:23:19 They were, they were grandmasters.
01:23:21 Like the Japanese have abandoned their Kung Fu ways
01:23:23 and taken up the project Diva ways and they have excelled.
01:23:27 And it was, it was pretty dope.
01:23:29 Spent a lot of time there.
01:23:30 Bought a lot of Jojo figures from these like crane machines.
01:23:33 Oh, one, one fun time I had was that,
01:23:36 like on the day I was leaving, I, there was this,
01:23:38 there was this two piece set of a,
01:23:42 a two piece of one piece.
01:23:44 No, unrelated to one piece actually.
01:23:46 There was, so early on when I was there,
01:23:48 there was like this crane machine, like,
01:23:50 that was set up with like a two piece thing.
01:23:52 One had C2 from Code Geass.
01:23:55 The other had Colin Kozuki.
01:23:56 And like on the first day, well, early on when I was there,
01:24:00 I won the C2 set, like a piece of the two piece set.
01:24:03 And I was like, yeah, great.
01:24:04 But one day I've got to get that Colin.
01:24:05 So I'll come back later.
01:24:07 And I never did until the very day I was leaving
01:24:09 to get on the plane to go home.
01:24:11 And I happened to walk by an arcade that had that Colin,
01:24:16 other half statue of what I had.
01:24:18 And I was like, well, this is a sign, gotta do it.
01:24:20 So I spent like two hours in this crane machine
01:24:24 just putting 100 yen after 100 yen,
01:24:26 after 100 yen into the machine,
01:24:28 trying to fucking get this thing.
01:24:30 And like after like half an hour,
01:24:32 the guy who owned the place just like noticed
01:24:34 what I was doing and like tried to come over
01:24:37 and give me some pointers to stop wasting money
01:24:38 to like actually help me win the thing.
01:24:40 Cause I definitely spend like hundreds of dollars
01:24:43 by the time this, well, okay, maybe a hundred all told.
01:24:45 What were you trying to get again?
01:24:47 I was trying to get like, so I've got the statue.
01:24:49 I've got, I'll put like a picture of it or something.
01:24:52 It's like a combining statue of, from the anime Code Geass,
01:24:57 C2 the character and Colin Kozuki.
01:25:00 And like you can put them independently.
01:25:01 That's Colin's dad felt to you.
01:25:04 No, no, I understand.
01:25:06 I am a true Japanese man.
01:25:07 I have been to the promised land.
01:25:08 I'm one of her now.
01:25:10 I am with the struggle.
01:25:13 And anyway, I fucking like eventually,
01:25:17 even his help was enough.
01:25:18 So eventually he just like adjusted its placement.
01:25:20 He re opened the thing, adjusted where the thing was.
01:25:23 Let me do it again.
01:25:24 And then I won the thing like immediately.
01:25:26 So basically he would put so much fucking money
01:25:30 into trying to buy what was probably a $20 toy
01:25:33 that he had to give it to you.
01:25:35 He just took pity on you.
01:25:36 That's exactly what happened.
01:25:37 He just took pity on this poor white man,
01:25:40 just throwing away his entire inheritance.
01:25:43 That figure was probably for sale in like a store behind you.
01:25:47 Like for half of what you spent on it.
01:25:50 But you know, then I would have this cool ass story.
01:25:53 And that's right, that's right.
01:25:54 This honest, honest engine who took pity on me
01:25:58 in the land of the rising sun.
01:26:02 And so that was that.
01:26:04 But one other thing looking back on that I noticed.
01:26:07 So one of the things I did while I was there,
01:26:09 like the other big expenditure I made
01:26:11 while I was in Japan was I bought a gym membership.
01:26:14 But getting a gym membership for like, even in America,
01:26:18 getting a gym membership for a short amount of time
01:26:20 is not something you can do easily.
01:26:22 So like I ended up spending like a quarter of my total money
01:26:26 on, yeah, like hundreds of dollars on this fucking gym membership.
01:26:32 Are you fucking kidding me?
01:26:34 I had to get my lifts.
01:26:35 I had to get my lifts while I was there.
01:26:37 It was, yeah, it was, you know, it was a really nice place.
01:26:42 It was the funniest thing was when I signed up,
01:26:44 I had to do like a one-on-one interview.
01:26:46 And like most of them spoke Japanese obviously,
01:26:47 but there was this one lady, this like young girl,
01:26:50 and they were all wearing the exact same like track suits.
01:26:52 They were all uniformed up as like staff members of the place.
01:26:56 It was, in fact, it was just like this fucking manga
01:26:59 I'm reading right now, Nankiro Damoru or whatever it's called.
01:27:03 It's about weightlifting girls.
01:27:04 Great, I love it.
01:27:06 But it was a very lovely experience going there.
01:27:09 But the cool thing I learned while I was there
01:27:11 that in gyms, in like weightlifting gyms in Japan,
01:27:14 did you know that if you have any tattoos,
01:27:18 you have to cover them up because there's so many Yakuza members
01:27:21 that go to these gyms with tattoos all the place
01:27:23 that it is inevitable that a gang war will break out in a gym
01:27:27 if they see each other's tats.
01:27:29 Yeah, so you got it.
01:27:30 You are not allowed to show any fucking tattoos on your skin
01:27:33 in any of the gyms in Japan.
01:27:34 Yeah, it's pretty dope.
01:27:36 But anyway, so yeah, that's how I spent my time there.
01:27:39 And the flight back was much more painful.
01:27:45 So like on my way back, I was late and just missed my flight
01:27:48 because I've never been very good at being on time for things.
01:27:51 And I fucked this one up bad.
01:27:53 So I probably got there an hour later or something.
01:27:55 I just didn't understand the travel times yet
01:27:57 to get to the airport specifically.
01:27:59 And when I got there, I missed my flight.
01:28:01 It was shitty.
01:28:02 So I just got a flight the next day.
01:28:05 I just got pushed back.
01:28:06 They took pity on me and gave me a flight the next day.
01:28:08 So I just spent a day in the Tokyo airport,
01:28:13 wherever the fuck this was.
01:28:15 And I used that time at the time.
01:28:18 I mean, my Japanese was at its best ever at this point.
01:28:21 So what I did was, this was a wonderful airport
01:28:23 with lots of shit to do.
01:28:24 So I just went on down to the bookstore,
01:28:26 bought myself the entirety of the Skypea arc
01:28:30 of one piece in one piece volumes
01:28:32 and the last 10 volumes that had come out at that time,
01:28:35 which was like during Fishman Island.
01:28:37 And just sat down, read myself some one piece,
01:28:40 tried to learn as much as I could.
01:28:41 Isn't it like 30 books?
01:28:44 I mean, I probably bought like 20 right there.
01:28:46 But they're pretty sure you have those.
01:28:48 Oh, so this car.
01:28:50 Yes.
01:28:51 So this car.
01:28:53 What were you saying, Mom?
01:28:54 How did you carry 20 anime books at the same time?
01:28:57 They're really not that big.
01:28:59 Like, they're small.
01:29:00 I mean, I have a bunch of them on myself.
01:29:02 I mean, they're like a book.
01:29:04 You don't know anime like me, all right?
01:29:05 You don't understand.
01:29:06 I've been to the Holy Land.
01:29:08 Who are you?
01:29:08 Who the fuck are you, Mumpy Jones?
01:29:10 No, no shit.
01:29:12 Anime books are smaller in Japan.
01:29:15 They are Motomichikaku shit.
01:29:20 I think the ones that they...
01:29:21 I think the ones that they...
01:29:22 Everything's smaller in Japan.
01:29:24 Hold on.
01:29:25 Yep.
01:29:26 Oh, Shisai.
01:29:27 Motochisai.
01:29:30 Why was I thinking Miji...
01:29:33 Well, I'll tell you why.
01:29:34 Ichiban Shisai.
01:29:35 I'm looking through my Japanese to English dictionary now
01:29:38 to figure out why I was thinking of...
01:29:39 Oh, I almost forgot.
01:29:40 I also went to Comic-Cat while I was there.
01:29:42 And that was cool.
01:29:43 Oh, fuck you, guy.
01:29:44 Yeah, I don't know.
01:29:45 I would love to go to fucking Comic-Cat.
01:29:48 If I... I would never go to Japan, fuck Japan.
01:29:50 The only reason I would ever break that promise
01:29:52 is if I could go to Comic-Cat.
01:29:54 Ben, what would you do at Comic-Cat with no money?
01:29:58 Eat a fucking dick, dude.
01:30:00 The only thing to do there is to buy shit.
01:30:03 It's a comic market.
01:30:04 I would look at fucking comics.
01:30:06 I would look at fucking dojin artists.
01:30:08 There is a second thing.
01:30:09 There is a second thing to do while you're there.
01:30:10 I would go to fucking be around people
01:30:12 that were buying shit tons of dojins.
01:30:14 It would be cool.
01:30:15 What's cool?
01:30:16 That is cool.
01:30:17 What's cool?
01:30:18 Davoo is literally howling.
01:30:20 Literally howling out my window.
01:30:23 I mean, Ben, we've both watched...
01:30:25 Fuck.
01:30:26 Comic-Party.
01:30:27 Comic-Party.
01:30:27 Right.
01:30:28 So we understand.
01:30:29 We knew right then and there.
01:30:30 Yeah.
01:30:31 That was the life for me.
01:30:33 Right.
01:30:33 So you can go there and you can reach it.
01:30:34 But the other cool thing that was happening there was like...
01:30:37 So at Comic-Cat, you're not allowed to take pictures
01:30:39 of cosplayers at any time.
01:30:41 Unless there's a giant open square
01:30:44 down to the side of the convention.
01:30:46 And that's where cosplay sluts go
01:30:49 to get their pictures taken.
01:30:50 And they get corralled in there.
01:30:52 And if you're in the danger zone,
01:30:53 people can take pictures of you and you can't complain.
01:30:56 You got to deal with that shit
01:30:58 within the bounds of decency, I'm sure.
01:31:01 So looking at all the...
01:31:02 Like the cosplay there was obviously far better
01:31:05 than any of the shitty conventions I've been to in America.
01:31:07 Comic-Cat cosplay is...
01:31:08 They know what's up.
01:31:10 Yeah.
01:31:10 And that's it.
01:31:11 That's based on the whole story.
01:31:12 Oh, so this guy...
01:31:14 Ah, yes, and you're...
01:31:16 So, so...
01:31:17 He's in your days.
01:31:18 He's in your...
01:31:19 Yeah, my trip to Japan really taught me a lot.
01:31:23 So what is the moral of all these stories?
01:31:26 What is the consensus on travel here?
01:31:28 The moral of the story is don't travel.
01:31:30 It's boring.
01:31:30 Don't go through customs because they're all fucking asshole.
01:31:33 Oh, I forgot my custom story.
01:31:34 Let me tell you my...
01:31:35 That's really short.
01:31:37 When I was on my way back,
01:31:38 when I got the flight in from Japan to
01:31:42 wherever like Chicago airport or whatever in America,
01:31:44 so like when I got through there,
01:31:46 like I didn't have to do any interview stuff.
01:31:47 Like it seems like you guys did when you traveled internationally,
01:31:50 but I did get like...
01:31:51 There was like one, you know,
01:31:52 international level of like bag searching and shit.
01:31:54 So like this guy opens my bag
01:31:56 and one of the things I had bought as like a present when I got back
01:31:58 was I bought my parents a big old bottle of sake.
01:32:02 And they just...
01:32:03 Foolish.
01:32:04 That's yeah, it's totally illegal
01:32:06 and you're not allowed to do it at all.
01:32:07 And he's just like...
01:32:08 Wait.
01:32:09 You got a bottle...
01:32:10 Well, it's because like you can't...
01:32:11 You could like store shit in it or something.
01:32:12 Not to mention you can't have liquids above like...
01:32:15 Yeah, I just had it in my bag.
01:32:17 Oh, okay.
01:32:18 And so like the guy just stops me.
01:32:20 That's true of all flights, not just international.
01:32:22 You cannot bring liquids onto a flight.
01:32:24 Well, I don't remember if this was on in my carry-on
01:32:27 or in like my separate bag.
01:32:29 It must have been my carry-on.
01:32:30 I don't actually remember.
01:32:31 But like whatever bag it was,
01:32:32 this guy examined it and he opened up and he's like,
01:32:35 Dude, you know this is illegal, right?
01:32:37 And I was like, I don't know anything about anything.
01:32:41 Why would you think that I know anything you asked for?
01:32:43 You immediately went,
01:32:44 Ah, so this guy!
01:32:48 I am just a Japanese grandmother.
01:32:50 I am just a Japanese grandmother.
01:32:52 I saw the officer.
01:32:53 It's his first time I do it.
01:32:56 That was pretty much what I said,
01:32:57 just in my perfect English.
01:32:59 And he, you know, he literally just...
01:33:02 He was like, dude, you know this is illegal, right?
01:33:04 You're not allowed to travel this.
01:33:05 And I was like, I'm sorry, please.
01:33:07 Is that a fact, sir?
01:33:09 Yeah.
01:33:10 And he just said, all right, no big deal.
01:33:12 Go on, let me go.
01:33:13 You nigger, how'd you even get away with this?
01:33:14 He let me keep it.
01:33:15 He didn't even take it.
01:33:15 He let me keep it and just let me go.
01:33:17 And then I gave it to my parents and we all drank it
01:33:19 and it was a grand old time.
01:33:21 And when I got back from Japan,
01:33:23 my parents had tried to put together a sign
01:33:26 that said welcome back, Nate,
01:33:28 or like welcome to America in Japanese.
01:33:30 And they fucked it all up.
01:33:31 It was a bunch of nonsense.
01:33:33 Embarrassing.
01:33:34 It was truly embarrassing.
01:33:36 That's when I knew they were, we were done.
01:33:38 That's when we were done that day.
01:33:40 They can't even speak the king's Japanese.
01:33:42 The king's Japanese.
01:33:44 The emperor's Japanese, whatever.
01:33:45 I'll say that that time going to the Philippines
01:33:49 was real scary and it was difficult on the travel.
01:33:53 And a couple of times I flew out to Montana
01:33:57 to take the Clunge Plunge.
01:33:59 It was disgusting.
01:34:01 It was still a little like, the first time I did it,
01:34:07 I was, it was still kind of a pain in the ass.
01:34:09 But by the second time I was like, you know what?
01:34:11 Flying, whatever.
01:34:14 Ain't that big a deal?
01:34:15 The funny thing is like, I think I was always so afraid
01:34:17 of like everything going wrong.
01:34:19 But even when stuff does go wrong,
01:34:20 it's fixed pretty easily.
01:34:22 It just wastes time.
01:34:23 It's just like, oh, you missed your flight.
01:34:24 Well, you got to take one like in four hours.
01:34:27 So have fun fucking around the airport, you know?
01:34:30 It's, people are pretty accommodating really.
01:34:32 Like you'll, if you miss a flight, they'll help you,
01:34:34 but you will have to wait until like,
01:34:36 you just got to waste a bunch of fucking time.
01:34:37 And I've gotten so used to the airport itself
01:34:41 because of radcons one and two,
01:34:44 where I was constantly driving back and forth
01:34:47 to the airport to pick people up.
01:34:49 And now I have like, I could perfectly envision
01:34:53 every square inch of that airport now.
01:34:55 Like I know it like the back of my hand.
01:34:57 So I have a sense of confidence about that airport.
01:34:59 Like, you know, if I got to fly somewhere from here,
01:35:02 I know exactly what it's going to be like.
01:35:04 I know what's going to happen.
01:35:05 Nothing's alien to me, you know.
01:35:08 I finally understand how baggage claim works
01:35:11 after having watched Jesse go through it.
01:35:13 So, yeah, I feel like, you know what, travel, yeah, whatever.
01:35:19 But the cost of travel,
01:35:24 kind of like everything in life.
01:35:25 You just got to know what you're getting yourself into
01:35:27 and then calculate if it's worth it
01:35:29 because it costs money, it costs time.
01:35:31 It'd be nice if we could just tell up our people places,
01:35:33 but we can't.
01:35:33 So just, you know, that whole ending part
01:35:39 was just so I could say the phrase, clunge, plunge.
01:35:42 That's the only reason I told that part of the story.
01:35:44 Good, worth it.
01:35:47 So how about we just go to questions?
01:35:48 Yeah, questions, questions.
01:35:49 Some of these shits.
01:35:50 All right.
01:35:51 I remember everybody tweet us.
01:35:52 We tweet out when we were fucking doing the shit,
01:35:54 usually on Saturdays or on like 4 p.m. or so.
01:35:56 So at TP Crasnators, all right, let's see what we got.
01:35:59 Hey Nate, remember when mom and dad took us to Mexico
01:36:02 and we stayed at Club Med?
01:36:04 Um, actually I don't remember that at all.
01:36:07 I was like 4.
01:36:08 I remember that it happened sort of.
01:36:10 And I vaguely, vaguely remember it
01:36:12 and that was the only good travel story of my miserable life.
01:36:16 Really?
01:36:16 You remember fondly?
01:36:17 I was in Vietnam.
01:36:18 No, it sucked.
01:36:19 It actually sucked, but I do sort of remember.
01:36:21 I sort of remember being annoyed and not liking it.
01:36:24 And there we go.
01:36:25 Well you know, our dad took us to a lot of places.
01:36:27 He liked to travel and we've been to like
01:36:29 Seattle as a family and like Disney.
01:36:31 That's true.
01:36:32 And we went to a couple.
01:36:33 We went to a couple new worlds.
01:36:34 I went to a new world.
01:36:34 Yeah, I didn't go to land.
01:36:35 I went to a new world.
01:36:37 And we'd been to, you know, like the Grand Canyon
01:36:40 and just like Utah.
01:36:41 Oh yeah, we did travel to the Grand Canyon.
01:36:43 We went to see the place that I wanted to see,
01:36:45 which was Utah Arches National Park.
01:36:47 If only I had been old enough to remember any of this story.
01:36:51 I have had the ultimate travel story in my life,
01:36:54 but I was a child because my parents
01:36:57 toured with Lollapalooza.
01:36:59 It's a big fucking tour from the 90s
01:37:03 that the Jane's Addiction created.
01:37:06 And it was just like every fucking cool band of the 90s
01:37:10 would all tour around the country.
01:37:12 We went to like 36 different states
01:37:13 because my parents were running a clothes vendor.
01:37:16 So we traveled in a fucking,
01:37:18 in a shitty fucking mobile home
01:37:21 that broke down constantly.
01:37:22 All kinds of terrible stuff happened.
01:37:24 Every story I've heard from it
01:37:26 is like, this is the ultimate story,
01:37:28 but I'm too young to remember any of it.
01:37:30 So I can't tell.
01:37:31 The only thing, the only thing I remember
01:37:34 other than skipping rocks with Green Day,
01:37:38 because Green Day would babysit me and Victor
01:37:40 in exchange for clothes at the time.
01:37:43 Is that actually the band you're talking about?
01:37:45 Yeah, the band Green Day would babysit me and Victor
01:37:48 and we were babies in exchange for free clothes from my dad.
01:37:51 And you can see that the clothes that my dad gave them
01:37:54 was from Perniche.
01:37:55 They wore it at Woodstock in 95, so.
01:37:58 Well, shit.
01:37:59 Yeah, so I was babysat by Green Day on this tour.
01:38:02 It's ironic because now you're an American idiot.
01:38:05 Yeah, and I remember we were going to the Grand Canyon,
01:38:09 but for some reason I heard Grand Cannon.
01:38:11 So I spent the whole time thinking
01:38:12 we were going to a giant cannon.
01:38:15 I thought it would be fucking awesome.
01:38:17 It would be.
01:38:18 Yeah, and I remember that while I was thinking
01:38:20 about the Grand Cannon, the smashing pumpkin song,
01:38:25 in spite of all my rage, I'm still just
01:38:26 a rat in the cage.
01:38:27 I don't know what it's called.
01:38:28 That song was playing.
01:38:29 That's all I remember of my trip around the world
01:38:32 to 36 states or about America.
01:38:34 When I think of Grand Canyons,
01:38:37 I think of my favorite cannon,
01:38:38 which is the ones that send you places from Secret of Mana.
01:38:41 Yeah, Cannon Travel Agency.
01:38:43 Cannon Travel Agency.
01:38:44 All right, that's enough about my bullshit.
01:38:47 Okay, what kind of questions we got here?
01:38:49 Let's see, okay, let me find one.
01:38:53 Okay, I got to find a filler one,
01:38:55 so you guys can talk while I find one that's better.
01:38:57 I'm gay.
01:38:58 I'm gay.
01:39:00 Okay, here we go.
01:39:00 Sold us, guys.
01:39:01 Sold us, man.
01:39:03 Megan Lau at Nyan Kwan asks,
01:39:06 how do I become as suicidal as Monkey Jones?
01:39:09 Oh, shit.
01:39:10 Well, we'll fucking watch his video
01:39:13 on top deadliest suicide methods.
01:39:15 But that's once you're already suicidal, that's useful.
01:39:17 How does she get to want to do that?
01:39:19 I'd say just based on who you might be,
01:39:21 I think if you watch either the Depression video
01:39:24 and or the Elliot Roger review,
01:39:26 maybe it'll get you there.
01:39:29 Yes.
01:39:30 Okay, here's one.
01:39:31 AtcoreReviews asks,
01:39:33 guys, how do you feel about cooking slash baking?
01:39:36 Do you enjoy it and are you good at it?
01:39:39 The answer for Ben is no,
01:39:42 because he just had a huge baking experiment.
01:39:45 Don't say it.
01:39:47 Don't say it.
01:39:48 Now I'm curious.
01:39:49 You know what?
01:39:49 You didn't like it,
01:39:50 but I thought it came out pretty good.
01:39:52 You just didn't like the ingredients.
01:39:54 That's all.
01:39:54 No, don't fucking say it.
01:39:56 You need to tell us right now.
01:39:57 Don't say it.
01:39:58 You know what?
01:39:58 If you say it, I'm just going to edit it out.
01:40:00 I'm not sure why it's a secret,
01:40:01 because this video won't come out for a week and a half.
01:40:05 I don't care.
01:40:06 You're not allowed.
01:40:07 Wait, are you just saying this is a time-sensitive thing?
01:40:09 Yes.
01:40:10 That's the reason.
01:40:10 Anyway.
01:40:11 That's fine.
01:40:12 The people will know one day.
01:40:13 Just tweet about yourself.
01:40:13 It was whatever.
01:40:14 You didn't like the ingredients.
01:40:15 That's fine.
01:40:16 That's fine.
01:40:16 It's not for everyone.
01:40:17 It's only for people with refined palates like myself.
01:40:20 You should have gone to Papa John's for better ingredients.
01:40:22 Yeah.
01:40:23 That's true.
01:40:25 Shit.
01:40:25 Now I want pizza more than I want beans.
01:40:27 I forgot about my desire for beans earlier.
01:40:29 Oh, then who's got cut out of your beans?
01:40:32 Hey, it's not the first time, and it won't be the last.
01:40:36 Hey, here's one.
01:40:37 Monkey, this is mostly for you,
01:40:38 because you just do this the most of the time.
01:40:39 Me again.
01:40:40 Well, it's for everybody.
01:40:42 But at JoshRushyAsk,
01:40:43 what's the weirdest slash most disgusting snaps,
01:40:45 as in Snapchat, I assume,
01:40:47 you guys have ever gotten from fans?
01:40:49 Immediately after doing the interview with Monkey,
01:40:52 where I was saying,
01:40:53 I was asking him if he gets dick pics,
01:40:54 and he said every day,
01:40:56 and I said, I've never gotten one.
01:40:57 And so immediately someone sent me a dick pic,
01:41:00 and I blocked it.
01:41:01 So then I realized why I don't get dick pics
01:41:06 is because anytime something happens to Monkey,
01:41:10 and I think, man, how have I been so lucky
01:41:12 that my fans aren't like that.
01:41:14 I then remember that anytime
01:41:15 anyone fucks with me in the slightest,
01:41:17 I blocked them.
01:41:17 And that's why it just happened to me.
01:41:20 Solid, solid reason.
01:41:22 Okay, so the worst thing I can think of right now
01:41:26 is just like a close-up of a guy's hairy asshole
01:41:29 while he's shitting,
01:41:30 so I can see the shit come out of my mouth.
01:41:32 Oh my god, no.
01:41:34 And it puts me to snap,
01:41:35 so like you kind of know what you're looking at.
01:41:36 Yeah, how the fuck did he do that?
01:41:38 Ben sees that, and Ben just thinks,
01:41:39 oh man, dinner is served.
01:41:41 Here we go.
01:41:41 How did he pull off this fucking snap?
01:41:46 That's like impressive.
01:41:47 That is impressive.
01:41:48 No, I didn't interview him about it.
01:41:49 I've got to bring him on.
01:41:50 Do an interview with this man, Monkey.
01:41:52 We need this.
01:41:53 I finally started, finally, after all this time,
01:41:57 I finally started getting nudes on Snapchat,
01:41:59 and I've been trying to send them back,
01:42:01 but it's so difficult to hold my gigantic phone,
01:42:05 which by the way is an S7 Edge,
01:42:08 so it's got the little,
01:42:09 like it's got the,
01:42:10 like if your fingers touch the little edge piece,
01:42:12 and it does, you know, it'll do things,
01:42:14 so like trying to hold the phone and press the button
01:42:17 and hold it at an angle where you can actually like see me
01:42:20 is just impossible.
01:42:22 I'm like, how the fuck, like,
01:42:23 I don't know how the, how she's sending me
01:42:27 these impressive pictures,
01:42:29 but I can't fucking do it without breaking my hand.
01:42:34 Well, you win some.
01:42:35 Yeah, I, yeah, I know what you mean.
01:42:37 I actually, I mean, I try to take progress pics
01:42:40 to keep track of like my muscle building and stuff,
01:42:42 and it's actually really hard.
01:42:44 It's fucking hard to go and do that shit.
01:42:46 I usually, I'll just like turn on the camera
01:42:48 and like record and then just take a video
01:42:50 and then just divide up into clips.
01:42:51 So if somebody ever hacked into my computer,
01:42:53 they would find in many pictures of me mostly naked.
01:42:57 Not entirely though.
01:42:58 Okay, here's one.
01:42:59 At LazyAceDia asks,
01:43:02 was there ever a time you questioned your sexuality
01:43:04 or have you always known you were gay?
01:43:07 I always knew.
01:43:12 Next question.
01:43:13 I always knew.
01:43:14 Yeah, that's, I think we all knew.
01:43:17 Let me see here.
01:43:20 Okay, let's, all right, let's,
01:43:23 fuck, no, hang on.
01:43:24 Let's fuck.
01:43:24 That's actually shit.
01:43:25 That's gay.
01:43:27 Which is why I'm into it.
01:43:29 Yeah.
01:43:29 Okay, here's that.
01:43:31 We can end after one of these or something.
01:43:33 But this guy asks, advice, what's the perfect ratio
01:43:35 at M Spectrum asks, what's the perfect ratio
01:43:39 of editing to video output?
01:43:41 Snore, what a gay question.
01:43:44 I'm just, I'm just saying, is there,
01:43:45 is there a number to be found?
01:43:46 No editing whatsoever is the ideal level of editing.
01:43:50 Just do the opposite of what Nate does.
01:43:52 Yeah, anything that's not what Nate's doing
01:43:55 is what you should be doing.
01:43:56 To me, anything that's not that.
01:44:00 If it takes, I mean, anything that I don't send to DeVoo,
01:44:05 the most it's gonna take me to edit is a couple hours.
01:44:08 I should be able to do it in one sitting.
01:44:10 And if it, if I can't do it in one sitting,
01:44:12 it means it's gonna be, it's gonna be hell before it gets,
01:44:16 like the top 10 and top 20 anime of the year videos.
01:44:20 I edited those myself.
01:44:22 Each of them only took a couple of hours to do,
01:44:24 but because there were so many breaks in the workflow,
01:44:28 then it took me like days.
01:44:30 And I was only able to finally do it
01:44:32 when I like got shit-faced and could convince myself to work.
01:44:36 I hate editing.
01:44:38 I remember that.
01:44:40 Yes, editing is bad.
01:44:42 This guy, incidentally, actually, never mind.
01:44:45 Okay, last question.
01:44:46 Let's end on this one.
01:44:47 At Wienermeister asks,
01:44:49 TP Crasnears, where is my dad?
01:44:51 I haven't seen him in two weeks.
01:44:54 You might have to ask for asking.
01:44:56 You might have to ask our buddy.
01:44:57 I mean, I know I was complicit in this,
01:44:59 but I don't actually know what Munchie does
01:45:01 with the dads that we steal,
01:45:03 so you'll have to consult Munchie about it.
01:45:06 I know I've got someone's dad in my trunk,
01:45:08 but it might not necessarily be your dad.
01:45:10 Yeah, I mean, I just steal the dads.
01:45:13 Well, wait, what was this guy's name?
01:45:15 It was at Wienermeister.
01:45:17 Well, Wienermeister, I mean, is your dad too missing his hands, feet, and head?
01:45:24 If so, it may be him.
01:45:28 Okay, that's enough.
01:45:30 Once again, all terrible questions.
01:45:32 Do better next time, people.
01:45:33 Very disappointed.
01:45:35 As always, terrible questions.
01:45:39 Words of encouragement from best guy ever.
01:45:41 Do better next time.
01:45:43 I get it.
01:45:45 Our audience has this weird...
01:45:48 It should be the easiest thing in the world to ask questions.
01:45:50 Just make them stuff that all of us can answer,
01:45:54 because we will not select your question otherwise.
01:45:56 When we were doing the let's plays,
01:45:58 we had, like, me...
01:45:59 Oh, man, that was a disaster.
01:46:01 Yeah, I put out a tweet that's like,
01:46:02 me, Munchie, and Victor are playing video games.
01:46:05 Tweet us questions.
01:46:06 And, like, half the questions are stuff like,
01:46:08 what's your favorite anime studio?
01:46:10 I'm like,
01:46:10 brother fucker, these two don't even know what an anime studio is.
01:46:14 I bet Munchie cannot name one fucking anime studio.
01:46:18 A1 Pictures is the best one.
01:46:19 There you go, that's true.
01:46:21 Expect to have anime-related questions just soundly, roundly ignored.
01:46:27 I am the...
01:46:28 Let me get this...
01:46:29 Since people don't seem to understand this,
01:46:31 because everyone in the PCP likes some anime,
01:46:35 but I am the only member of the PCP
01:46:38 who gives a single fuck about anime.
01:46:40 Maybe Nate as a second...
01:46:42 They might be confused to think that I give a fuck about anime.
01:46:45 Really don't.
01:46:45 No, Nate watches like...
01:46:47 They are deeply confused.
01:46:49 For anybody,
01:46:50 if you're watching anyone's channel other than mine,
01:46:52 the amount of shows that they've talked about on their channel
01:46:55 is just about the exact same as the amount of shows they've seen.
01:46:59 Like, there's...
01:46:59 Well, that is not true for me.
01:47:00 That is not true for me.
01:47:02 Okay, we'll say double then.
01:47:04 Double, double the...
01:47:06 You are underestimating how many fucking shows I've seen.
01:47:08 Well, then you...
01:47:09 I started watching anime before you fucking child.
01:47:11 You're a little baby, you don't know anything about anime.
01:47:12 You did not start watching anime before me.
01:47:14 Don't...
01:47:14 I think you might have.
01:47:15 You started watching during the original Adult Swim,
01:47:16 because that's the old school Adult Swim,
01:47:18 when they had the actual footage of pools and shit.
01:47:20 Yeah, 2001.
01:47:21 That's...
01:47:22 Okay, there you go.
01:47:23 So same time.
01:47:23 But I mean, that's when I found out it was called anime.
01:47:25 You know, I mean, I've been watching Sailor Moon and Pokemon.
01:47:28 Pokemon and Yukio and shit.
01:47:30 Well, Yukio would have been after Adult Swim started, but...
01:47:34 Look, we all know you watch more anime than me.
01:47:36 Well, that's why I said that he was the only other person
01:47:39 who could be said to care about anime out here.
01:47:41 Like, I mean, you and Ben have seen it.
01:47:43 Like, Hippo has maybe seen, like, 15 shows total, if that.
01:47:47 You know, like, he's only watched...
01:47:48 I've probably seen...
01:47:49 I've probably seen 20, 25.
01:47:52 I just do not care about the anime industry nearly as much as you.
01:47:56 I mean, I care about it because I like anime.
01:47:57 I want more good ones.
01:47:58 But that's it, you know.
01:47:59 Yeah, there you go.
01:48:02 All right, that's it.
01:48:03 We're done.
01:48:03 Oh, and I was just gonna say one more on your topic,
01:48:06 on your point, Ben, that, yeah, my words of wisdom
01:48:10 for the people here, always bad questions.
01:48:12 Remember, the two most damaging words
01:48:16 in the English language are good job.
01:48:19 So never, you know...
01:48:20 What?
01:48:21 That's from fucking whiplash.
01:48:22 That's from whiplash.
01:48:23 Oh, shit.
01:48:24 Because you gotta challenge people
01:48:25 and tell them that they're shit until they get good.
01:48:27 And no matter how good they actually are,
01:48:29 they can always be better.
