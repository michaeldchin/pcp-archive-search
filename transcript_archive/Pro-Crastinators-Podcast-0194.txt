00:00:00 Hello everyone, welcome. It's PCP. You know what it is. You know where you are. Welcome,
00:00:08 one and all. I'm the best guy ever. Join today by my brother Ben Saint.
00:00:14 It's nap time on the PCP. It's time to go to bed.
00:00:19 And you know him. Beloved sisters of Battle, Munchy, and Gibbontake. They're sisters. This is their lore.
00:00:28 We're brothers. They're sisters. This is a shit intro I don't care about. Radcon!
00:00:34 Hey, you're a week late idiot. We already talked about that last week.
00:00:38 Yeah, but the Kickstarter is like out, right? Or you know, gonna be out?
00:00:42 It may well be. It's possible. As a recording, we only God knows.
00:00:48 Did I tell you Ben that I was wrong about the 8-day thing? It's actually like a 1-3-day review period.
00:00:52 I saw the message. That's simply epic.
00:00:56 Is Kickstarter out by now? Is it not out by now? Only unchecked by doing the description.
00:01:01 My Kickstarter got approved in like an hour. So I'm hoping it performs similarly.
00:01:08 I feel it's a little awkward. If we knew it was coming out, I would love to be. Go to it now.
00:01:12 But I can say, if it is out, it's Schrodinger's kick. Go to it now.
00:01:16 Check the description.
00:01:18 Check the description box.
00:01:23 This Kickstarter exists in a state of superposition until examined, upon which time the URL links to the Kickstarter.
00:01:31 So we'll see if that happens.
00:01:33 I want to have a real heart to heart, real father to son moment with the audience right here.
00:01:37 Because I want to hopefully illustrate why exactly I'm back right now at this crucial juncture in the PCP's development.
00:01:44 Because for the past couple months, I've been thinking, you know, recording the PCP, whatever.
00:01:51 Who even fucking cares about that shit?
00:01:54 I hate money also.
00:01:55 What? Democrats? Republicans? I love those guys. And then I wouldn't go on the PCP.
00:02:03 And then, going to the PCP chat to discuss Radcon 4, you know, getting all worked up about this, and spending the many, many late hours at night.
00:02:13 I am so fucking sick of all of you after this week of nothing but nonstop discord calls working out all the bullshit.
00:02:20 I'm at the exact opposite where it's like, oh my god, actually I like everyone. Oh god, the PCP's cool actually.
00:02:27 So let's see if the PCP's cool or just the PC is cool.
00:02:31 On this episode, this will be a tryout run.
00:02:33 What? I hear you.
00:02:34 Oh wait, no I get it. It took me a second.
00:02:36 Very, very hard to understand.
00:02:39 We're going to have a battle against our rival, the MacP, you know?
00:02:44 Make Donald?
00:02:46 You know what I'm saying?
00:02:47 Stop, you're making me hungry.
00:02:48 Tim Cook?
00:02:49 Do you want to go get McDonald's Ben?
00:02:51 Yeah, a little bit. I'll just go get my classic two McDoubles, throw away the bun.
00:02:56 Dude, the other day I ate two McDoubles and it felt like I was a fucking god.
00:03:01 Did you throw away the bun?
00:03:03 No, I didn't.
00:03:05 Well, you were fucking wrong.
00:03:07 I like the bun. I feel like the bun...
00:03:09 Yeah, you like inflammation, you like diabetes.
00:03:13 You like to be a fucking coward.
00:03:16 I like soggy bread and I like ketchup and mustard which gets stained all over the bun.
00:03:22 Loves that sugar rest. Loves that insulin spike in his blood, you know?
00:03:25 Oh wait, I've been counting my calories and I, every single day, every single day has just been constant agony and not even worth it-ness.
00:03:35 Because I'm so fucking hungry. I'm just nodding off my own arm every single second that I get.
00:03:41 I'm literally the hungriest person and I'm starving to death actively as we speak right fucking now.
00:03:46 It's been a nightmare.
00:03:48 It has been challenging.
00:03:50 It's great.
00:03:51 Try to go an entire day without eating.
00:03:54 I did that yesterday until, I guess, Michelle did bring me a bunch of mochi late in the day, but it's not that hard.
00:04:01 Just for fun. And then you'll wake up the next day and you'll be hungry but you won't want to eat that much because you'll get full really fast.
00:04:09 I have done that before in the past, like intentionally, like I've fasted for a couple days.
00:04:14 I mean, I could use it again to refresh my memory.
00:04:18 I mean, because if you're used to eating a lot or more and then you go down to less, you're like, oh no, I'm accustomed to more food than this.
00:04:26 But if you fast for a little bit and then you start eating again, you're accustomed to less.
00:04:31 That's genius moves.
00:04:33 We're going to tell them comments that are just like, um, that's really like a bad view.
00:04:37 You're irresponsible. You're going to kill, you're going to kill a munchie, Ben. What are you doing?
00:04:41 He doesn't know any better.
00:04:43 Dude, if you don't eat food for one day, you fucking keel over and die so you could put a clock strikes mid night.
00:04:48 If there's one man who needs more kidney stones, it's munchie. There's no doubt.
00:04:53 Ben's got you covered on that front.
00:04:55 Speaking of food, I was walking past you.
00:04:57 Highly speculative.
00:04:58 I was in the grocery store the other day and I was walking past the ice cream section.
00:05:02 And I looked inside and you know, gazed at what it could be if I were a different man.
00:05:08 And I was looking and I saw an ice cream that I want to know your guys opinion on because I've been asked, I've been pulling everyone.
00:05:13 It seems nearly unanimous and I don't know why this product exists because it's so obviously reviled.
00:05:18 There's an ice cream where it is vanilla ice cream and then inside of the ice cream pent, there is french fries.
00:05:28 Like just pieces of french fries inside of it.
00:05:31 No, no, no.
00:05:32 Dipping french fries into shakes is delicious.
00:05:35 No, I'm against that as well.
00:05:37 Yeah, I'm against that too.
00:05:38 You're against that too.
00:05:39 No, I don't get it at all.
00:05:40 For sure.
00:05:41 For sure.
00:05:42 No, okay, okay.
00:05:43 I understand french fries and chocolate a little bit because it's like salted chocolate sort of thing.
00:05:49 I never really understood the milkshake thing.
00:05:52 That's a slightly more socially acceptable version of like melting a slice of American cheese on your apple pie.
00:05:59 It's equivalently disgusting to me.
00:06:01 It doesn't make any sense and I don't see the appeal at all.
00:06:06 The reason why you would dip a french fry into a shake is because you're getting a massive difference in texture and in flavor.
00:06:13 It's like way different things.
00:06:15 Okay, it's hot and it's cold.
00:06:17 It's fluffy and crunchy and it's soft and sweet.
00:06:20 It's way different.
00:06:21 You put them in an explosion of different types of perspective.
00:06:25 Are you trying to say that you're pro this thing, Munchie?
00:06:27 No, I'm not trying to say that.
00:06:28 He's obviously saying that.
00:06:30 Listen to how lovingly he's describing the experience.
00:06:32 But he just said no.
00:06:33 He's lying.
00:06:34 He's lying.
00:06:35 There's a difference here.
00:06:36 There's a difference here.
00:06:37 Dipping in a shake is not like this ice cream pint at all because the fucking french fries are all soggy and gross and cold and disgusting.
00:06:44 They aren't fluffier crispy and they aren't hot.
00:06:47 They don't balance against the ice cream at all.
00:06:48 They're just fucking potatoes.
00:06:50 I guess I sort of see the path of logic that would convince one to make this product.
00:06:54 These fries have been processed and they have lived in that ice cream for who knows how.
00:06:58 I'm sure they've fucking absorbed their native environment and just become a homogenous mess.
00:07:05 How many fries are we tossing inside this block of ice cream?
00:07:08 It sounds at best dumb and pointless and at worst disgusting.
00:07:13 I'm very against it.
00:07:17 Yep.
00:07:18 I see no justification for allowing this in a civilized society.
00:07:22 Imagine if you could have fucking...
00:07:24 Look at this cross-section.
00:07:26 I don't see it.
00:07:28 While you post that.
00:07:29 What were you saying Gib?
00:07:30 I'm trying to imagine it.
00:07:31 Oh yeah.
00:07:32 Could you like fucking imagine like energy drink ice creams?
00:07:35 Imagine bang ice cream.
00:07:37 I can imagine it.
00:07:38 Oh my god.
00:07:39 Oh my god guys.
00:07:40 I have said it.
00:07:41 I have said it for years.
00:07:42 Yesterday I found a...
00:07:45 I was looking at vapes.
00:07:47 I was looking at vape flavors and I found it.
00:07:49 They made it.
00:07:50 They made caffeinated vape.
00:07:52 Oh.
00:07:53 Whoa.
00:07:54 Really?
00:07:55 Yes.
00:07:56 With like taurine and B vitamins and shit.
00:07:58 It's like energy drink vape.
00:07:59 I want some so bad but they were sold out.
00:08:01 Okay.
00:08:02 I just...
00:08:03 For the sake of argument is through the lungs the correct way to absorb like B12 and you know...
00:08:09 You know it's a reasonable question and I don't know the answer.
00:08:13 Okay.
00:08:14 Okay.
00:08:15 Maybe.
00:08:16 But I mean the point is...
00:08:17 It's the superior option.
00:08:18 The point is I've been saying...
00:08:19 Like take it in the ass.
00:08:20 I've been saying the caffeinated vape sounds incredible and like something I want for a long time and I saw it.
00:08:26 It's real.
00:08:27 Somebody fucking did it.
00:08:28 Ben I had the exact same fucking altercation.
00:08:31 I found caffeinated water and they're like really fucking expensive for some reason.
00:08:37 Some order this as soon as I get and then I can get hydrated and caffeinated at the exact same thing.
00:08:42 We should be sponsored by waterjoe.com.
00:08:45 It's just water and caffeine.
00:08:46 What more do you need?
00:08:47 Dude look at how fucking like oh my god please think that I'm like really fucking healthy for you.
00:08:52 Please think that I will like make you cool.
00:08:54 They're clearly marketing this as like like to the people who like wake up, have like a cup of coffee, a black coffee and go to the gym.
00:09:00 They're like fuck the coffee man.
00:09:02 You just need the water and the caffeine.
00:09:03 You're a god of sports.
00:09:05 This french fry ice cream and I'm looking at the cross section.
00:09:08 I literally can't see the french fries.
00:09:10 We're talking about small bits of fries at most.
00:09:13 They are totally indistinguishable.
00:09:15 They don't look any different.
00:09:17 Oh look at that.
00:09:18 Aka in quote fast food.
00:09:20 Like on the label.
00:09:21 Stupid.
00:09:22 Yeah I guess so.
00:09:23 I mean I'd give it a try.
00:09:24 Actually you know I almost feel like the fact that it's like enmeshed in there and more and homogenized and just sort of blended into the.
00:09:31 It might make it better than.
00:09:33 It might.
00:09:34 Cause I'm on record.
00:09:35 I don't do the dip fries in milkshake thing.
00:09:37 I don't get it.
00:09:38 It doesn't appeal to me.
00:09:39 So I think maybe this might be better than that.
00:09:41 Just because maybe it would just sort of lend a kind of starchy salty texture to the ice cream itself.
00:09:46 Maybe.
00:09:47 I'd give it a shot.
00:09:49 You know what sounds like a really satisfying job though.
00:09:53 Being the guy who does cross sections of ice cream containers.
00:09:57 Yeah.
00:09:58 Probably gets a paid mad shit.
00:09:59 Cause this is definitely like a fucking shit.
00:10:01 I mean we're talking about a pro photographer.
00:10:02 People who made this ice cream are definitely on the fucking flight logs.
00:10:04 Honestly this doesn't look like that professional shot to me.
00:10:08 Like the resolution is not amazing.
00:10:10 But imagine taking this tub out of the freezer and just put it on the table and just take a knife and just like work it down through and split it in half and then set it out and take a picture.
00:10:20 Yeah I'd love to do that.
00:10:22 Do you think that they are working it down or do you think it's like a clean like samurai katana slice down the middle?
00:10:28 This looks like a fairly clean cut.
00:10:30 You need like a level 2, like a level 3, level 4 samurai to execute a slice of this level.
00:10:35 No.
00:10:36 You would want to get a very clean cross section with like a good down the middle cut.
00:10:40 And I don't think that like a clean like fast stroke would do that.
00:10:44 You would want to like play carefully place the knife on top of the tub and just like push it down slowly.
00:10:49 I'm sure they use like a bandsaw or some sort of like table.
00:10:53 You're probably right.
00:10:54 Thing to go zzz.
00:10:57 Wait dude.
00:10:58 Wait imagine.
00:10:59 Okay this cross section like this pint that's been cut in half.
00:11:02 What happens like after this photo?
00:11:04 Like does it just start like leaking out?
00:11:06 Like just start melting immediately and just spill on the fucking floor?
00:11:10 I mean well yeah.
00:11:11 They just throw it on the trash.
00:11:13 They're not going to eat it?
00:11:14 The cameraman's not going to eat every ice cream?
00:11:17 Are you mourning that somewhere out there a pint of ice cream was thrown away and not consumes?
00:11:22 It's the principle of the matter.
00:11:24 I understand.
00:11:25 People are starving in Africa.
00:11:27 It's true.
00:11:28 It's true.
00:11:29 Wait okay going back to this caffeinated water thing real quick.
00:11:32 I just want to say that I like every single day have been waking up and I've been drinking energy drinks.
00:11:36 And they're all great and they're literally good for you at any doctor that tells you that they aren't.
00:11:40 It's literally fucking lying to you and it makes no fucking sense and I don't even understand it.
00:11:44 It's literally paid off in every way.
00:11:45 It's paid off by big sport water.
00:11:48 My brain and body hurt all the time now and I'm starting to crumple up into like origami.
00:11:54 And so I'm thinking okay maybe all this extra sodium and stuff that I'm getting from the energy drink is maybe not good.
00:12:01 But I love caffeine and caffeine is actually good for you and any doctor that tells you that it's not is literally lying to you and wrong.
00:12:07 So how can I get caffeine and anything else?
00:12:09 I agree.
00:12:10 I've got a prescription for you and the prescription is get up and do yoga.
00:12:14 Do yoga.
00:12:15 First thing don't drink coffee.
00:12:16 Do yoga for 10 minutes when you wake up.
00:12:19 Are you for real?
00:12:21 I've been doing it.
00:12:22 I've been doing it the last little while.
00:12:24 What?
00:12:25 You could do both.
00:12:27 Those aren't mutually exclusive.
00:12:29 But one is free.
00:12:30 One is free though.
00:12:31 That's a plus for me.
00:12:32 What am I even coughing?
00:12:33 Well yeah.
00:12:34 I mean technically.
00:12:35 Coffee costs nothing.
00:12:36 Ben listen to the awe in Munchie's voice.
00:12:38 She's clearly into it.
00:12:39 Be a yogi guy.
00:12:40 I'm disgusted to the point of surprise.
00:12:44 I can't believe what I just fucking heard.
00:12:46 It was like a brain shock to me.
00:12:48 Nate you do yoga?
00:12:50 Is this the fucking bitch cast right now?
00:12:52 What's going on?
00:12:53 I am a mildly surprised.
00:12:54 But like I don't care either.
00:12:57 Yeah well it's not that interesting.
00:12:58 My fucking tea is dropping at astronomical levels.
00:13:02 What's wrong with yoga?
00:13:04 You're prepetuating.
00:13:06 This is literally toxic masculine.
00:13:08 You're prepetuating unhealthy gender stereotypes.
00:13:11 I think we have to vote fucking Nate on.
00:13:13 I specifically made sure I wasn't gay.
00:13:15 I respected the gender binary by making sure I did yoga for men.
00:13:19 Like all videos are exactly the same.
00:13:21 But I watched one for men.
00:13:22 Thank god.
00:13:23 I mean the way I think of yoga.
00:13:25 Like the first thing I think of is like the Wii balance board.
00:13:28 Dolce from Street Fighter?
00:13:29 No.
00:13:30 The Wii fit.
00:13:31 Like I think of yoga in that.
00:13:33 And I'm like yeah video games.
00:13:34 I like yoga.
00:13:35 That's gay.
00:13:36 There's a male fit.
00:13:37 You can choose a man if you want.
00:13:39 But the default is female.
00:13:40 Improving that it's default female.
00:13:42 God why do they have to make it so political by making the default female?
00:13:46 By choosing a woman.
00:13:47 Yeah yeah.
00:13:48 Oh have I told you guys the most hilarious joke I ever heard from a feminist
00:13:51 that I thought was legitimately great.
00:13:53 It was like it was just a Twitter post.
00:13:56 And it's like you know whatever.
00:13:58 And her post is that like doctor like it says to new father.
00:14:02 It's a girl.
00:14:03 Father replies ooh I just think that that's a little political.
00:14:06 Like why you put your agenda into like.
00:14:09 Why did it have to be a girl though?
00:14:12 Like what does that add to its arc?
00:14:14 Yeah exactly.
00:14:15 Great joke.
00:14:16 A legitimately great joke.
00:14:18 Alright.
00:14:19 I hate women.
00:14:20 Enough misogyny.
00:14:23 Enough of that because now it's time to talk about my Lord of Ghost comic that came out.
00:14:29 Oh of course it's out and it's great.
00:14:31 Yeah it's so good dude.
00:14:33 Oh thank you.
00:14:34 It's delicious.
00:14:35 It's so good.
00:14:37 I read it and I jumped onto Discord and I was like at Hippocrite.
00:14:42 Fuck I love this Lord of Ghost comic.
00:14:45 It's wicked cool.
00:14:47 Thanks for making it bro.
00:14:49 The structure is creative and excellently executed.
00:14:53 I know the only reason you made this comic is because you wanted to jump on the PCP
00:14:57 and say hey guys and then I want to say back to you to fulfill all your hopes and dreams
00:15:02 and your blood and your sweat and your tears.
00:15:04 You're cool.
00:15:05 Oh thanks guys.
00:15:08 The Lord of Ghost is cool.
00:15:10 Hey fuck you.
00:15:11 Can we get the Lord of Ghost on the PCP?
00:15:13 That'd be pretty cool.
00:15:14 Please?
00:15:15 He's called in before Hezney?
00:15:16 I can't remember.
00:15:17 I think he has.
00:15:18 He's been on at least once.
00:15:20 He's been on a bonus episode.
00:15:22 I mean he's a constant present.
00:15:23 He should come back to promote his comic though.
00:15:26 He definitely should leave a voicemail or something.
00:15:28 He's sort of the elephant in the room that no one will acknowledge.
00:15:30 Well it's sort of like the ghost in the room actually.
00:15:32 He has no elephant things about him.
00:15:33 I think you're thinking of terst where they've been?
00:15:35 I am thinking of terst where they've literally been.
00:15:38 All right enough.
00:15:39 Tell us about it.
00:15:40 Tell us the tale.
00:15:41 Oh yeah.
00:15:42 Well how did this come about?
00:15:44 Why are you doing this?
00:15:45 Also I want to know is this like the main comic you're working on?
00:15:48 Because I knew you were working on two.
00:15:50 Is there a big one?
00:15:52 I'm technically working on three.
00:15:53 This is like plan-wise.
00:15:57 This is like a practice comic to try and understand how they're made
00:16:02 and how to plan them and make them and stuff.
00:16:05 And then in the future I'll be working on more original things
00:16:09 that aren't tied to existing things like Endless War and whatever.
00:16:12 Right.
00:16:13 I was going to ask about that.
00:16:14 But yeah this came about because I wanted to...
00:16:20 Ever since the Lord of Ghosts canonically became mayor
00:16:24 I was exiled or like killed and I decided he should be exiled
00:16:28 and I wanted him to be a character in my rotating cast of characters
00:16:32 that I can use for things.
00:16:33 And I was always thinking of making a comic,
00:16:35 depicting what happens outside.
00:16:38 And so the obvious thing...
00:16:41 Outside of the city?
00:16:42 Outside of the city.
00:16:43 Yeah.
00:16:44 The next chapter is him traveling outside the city.
00:16:46 There's going to be a number of chapters, maybe five each of 20 pages in length.
00:16:50 I got to tell you Gib, I'm sick to death of Inside Slime City.
00:16:53 What's going on outside Slime City?
00:16:55 No it's not.
00:16:56 There's nothing interesting going on out there.
00:16:58 It's just a normal ass United States.
00:17:00 It's just desert and then probably towns and it's dumb and don't worry about it.
00:17:05 And like people...
00:17:06 There's not even any slime...
00:17:07 I don't know if you know this.
00:17:08 There's not any slime out there.
00:17:10 It's crazy.
00:17:11 Anyway, hippo continue.
00:17:14 But yeah, I wanted to do that.
00:17:18 I had this idea...
00:17:19 Originally it was going to be like Bale shape I was still working on.
00:17:23 I was going to finish that.
00:17:24 I had written or like sort of planned out some of this comic.
00:17:29 And then I was going to sketch it and hand it over to some RFCK people to like do the drawing.
00:17:36 Or some people I, you know, some art friends who are some RFCK related.
00:17:44 But it like it took me until the end of the year to finish the sketches because I was busy doing other things.
00:17:51 And by that time they had like, they had realized and sort of I had realized as well that if I were to hand these sketches over to them because they were too complete.
00:18:00 They wouldn't be able to like do their own style on top of them.
00:18:04 And so it would sort of be like kind of pointless for them to be involved.
00:18:08 And I decided, nah, I'm just going to do it.
00:18:11 And then I started doing it in January 1st.
00:18:13 I inked and shaded the first 20 pages and I pushed them.
00:18:17 And it was very prolific and it was very good.
00:18:20 I was very happy with a lot of the stuff in there.
00:18:24 The way the pages are like, you know, coming down in the beginning.
00:18:28 How it explains everything you need to know without too much like pointless extra stuff.
00:18:36 And the characterization things I put in there.
00:18:39 My favorite thing about the whole intro is that the entire time Lord of Ghosts is referring to himself as you.
00:18:48 Because he's anticipating as correctly that he will forget who he is and need to read it.
00:18:54 And so he'll he's writing it like an instructional guide, like you are this.
00:18:58 This is what you are thinking.
00:19:00 But on the very last page when he thinks he's going to die, he writes, I it's like I'm scared.
00:19:05 And because he's like thinking that this is the end.
00:19:08 He's like so panicky that he forgot to do that.
00:19:11 He's not he's not writing it to his future self.
00:19:14 Yeah, he's just being scared.
00:19:16 And it's like, oh, yeah, I'm so cool when I thought of that.
00:19:19 And I was like, yeah, I'm fucking smart or something.
00:19:22 The whole the whole thing about how I just I said this in the discord.
00:19:26 But the whole like the whole first part of it that is just like it's the pages that he wrote to himself.
00:19:31 And sometimes as you see the pay like in the background, like between pages,
00:19:35 you can see like the nega slime over the city and stuff.
00:19:38 It's so good.
00:19:40 It's so fucking cool.
00:19:42 Holy shit.
00:19:43 Hey, incidentally, can you tell him where they can read it?
00:19:46 So everybody who's now dying to do it.
00:19:48 You can go to give and take a dot site.
00:19:50 It should be the first comic at the top there.
00:19:52 That's my web comic website.
00:19:54 Bill J. was on there.
00:19:55 All my stuff is on there.
00:19:56 I also have a tapas tick tapas dot IO slash give and take or something and a web toon thing.
00:20:06 I think and you can find it on there.
00:20:08 There will be links and I'm just going to post to those three places every time I update.
00:20:14 Hopefully every single time, every single time.
00:20:18 I'm hoping this is optimistic, but I'm hoping to get the next chapter done in the in the in the next week.
00:20:26 Maybe probably be like 10 11 days from now from from this recording.
00:20:32 Oh my God, that's nothing.
00:20:33 But by the way, I want I want to say that you do not have to be an rf2k whiz kid to understand this.
00:20:39 No, it is very, very, very user friendly.
00:20:42 Like you can basically know nothing about it in this war and you will be able to easily.
00:20:46 I mean, even if you didn't know anything about it, like I don't.
00:20:50 Yeah, you would totally get what's happening.
00:20:53 I mean, there's a little bit explains to you.
00:20:55 I mean, you know, you'll have to use some context clues in some areas.
00:20:58 But for the most part, you're going to be able to basically get every single thing.
00:21:01 I mean, if you have context in the endless war, some some things might be like, oh, I know what that is.
00:21:06 But like, it's not like it's perfectly understandable without that.
00:21:11 Yeah, that was my main thing.
00:21:13 Just like slime and punishment.
00:21:14 Slime and punishment is also that way.
00:21:16 By the way, people just like endless war itself.
00:21:19 By the way, it's not that fucking hard to get into you.
00:21:21 Stupid fucking idiots.
00:21:22 It's literally not that hard.
00:21:24 It's really fucking simple.
00:21:25 You fucking boobs.
00:21:26 I was really thinking of like the digi factor.
00:21:28 Like if I told Digi to read this, would he?
00:21:30 And I think the fact that he knows what endless war is, he would be like, oh, it's not for me.
00:21:36 But like, I will try to convince him because it's the only thing that is RFCK is the setting.
00:21:46 And I like structured it with like Act One, Act Two, Act Three, like a real story with a character that you're following.
00:21:54 It's just a narrative.
00:21:56 You don't need to know any prior knowledge.
00:21:58 It's just a narrative.
00:22:00 It's just a narrative.
00:22:01 You can just read it.
00:22:02 That's like the polar opposite of it's just two frames.
00:22:05 Like you derisively like just two frames, then you like happy looking up towards heaven.
00:22:09 It's a real narrative.
00:22:11 I feel so powerful.
00:22:16 Maybe if we're lucky we play our cards right, we can make enough money to fly Lord of Ghosts out to Radcon for Mappy and I's special guest.
00:22:23 He was at RFCKCon London.
00:22:25 He was hanging out.
00:22:26 I wonder what point in his timeline that occurred.
00:22:29 I wonder when and where that happens.
00:22:32 Or maybe it's an out of canon experience.
00:22:35 Out of body experience.
00:22:37 My wonder.
00:22:38 I wonder what's for dinner.
00:22:40 If we acquire vast sums of cash required to buy one bed sheet and perhaps scissors to cut holes in the eyes,
00:22:49 maybe we could use that as a material vessel to summon forth the Lord of Ghosts from wherever he exists in Canada.
00:22:55 We'll have to get like a pentagram and place those in the middle.
00:22:57 Yeah, I getcha.
00:22:58 Yeah.
00:22:59 That would be great.
00:23:00 We'll have to get some slime.
00:23:02 We'll have to get some anti-slime to tempt him.
00:23:05 You know, quick aside on this out of canon thing.
00:23:08 You know, we had an interesting experience on my Nuzlocke yesterday,
00:23:10 which was the time finally came for Russell to shed his mortal coil.
00:23:14 I was there.
00:23:15 I was there.
00:23:16 Oh, were you?
00:23:17 When Radifriker's cop killers ended, you were still going, so I...
00:23:20 That's right.
00:23:21 I forgot to say it in the chat, so I said,
00:23:23 I ended the stream and then a minute later I was like,
00:23:25 wait a minute, fuck, I can raid.
00:23:27 Some of the people had left, but I raided with whoever was left.
00:23:30 Please keep doing it.
00:23:31 I mean, I just can't remember to do that ever, but I always mean to.
00:23:34 Try to remember.
00:23:35 I know it's hard.
00:23:36 I did it.
00:23:37 You can do it too, Nate.
00:23:38 I believe in you.
00:23:39 Once I get in the habit, I will do it.
00:23:40 That's true.
00:23:41 I did it the last time.
00:23:42 Honestly, it's good practice.
00:23:44 Just pick a fucking stranger and raid him.
00:23:47 You're right.
00:23:48 As long as your name gets out there, that's probably good for you.
00:23:50 Yeah, like nobody loses anything by it.
00:23:53 It's just a good...
00:23:54 Just end every stream by raiding someone.
00:23:56 Why the fuck not?
00:23:57 That's a good thing.
00:23:58 That's a good thing.
00:23:59 I'll try to do that.
00:24:00 I'm not gonna say.
00:24:01 But anyway, the point is that I stuck around because I saw the trials of Russell.
00:24:06 Right.
00:24:07 So we were in this horrible battle in the underground in Goldenrod, and there was this boy with
00:24:11 psychic powers who was really fucking me up.
00:24:13 Oh, no.
00:24:14 This is Route 36.
00:24:15 It doesn't matter.
00:24:16 We got into one of those situations where if anything happened, someone was gonna die,
00:24:21 and this is exactly what Russell was made for.
00:24:24 If I remember, it was because you had Doon Koon, the Pidgeot, no, the Pidgeotto, and you
00:24:29 were gonna quick attack there at Kadabra, I think, but he was confused.
00:24:35 So if the quick attack had gone off, you would have won, but if you were stricken with confusion,
00:24:40 you would kill yourself because you were a low HP.
00:24:42 And the way to guarantee the victory would be to switch in.
00:24:45 So it was a total coinflip.
00:24:46 Total coinflip.
00:24:47 Exactly.
00:24:48 So the only thing to do was to put out Russell to take the blow, switch back into Pidgeotto,
00:24:52 and that guarantees success.
00:24:53 The only thing to do was take the coward's way out.
00:24:56 That's exactly what...
00:24:57 Everyone was cheering for we hashtag LetRussellRussell, and he wrestled his fiercest, and actually
00:25:02 he had a little moment of glory earlier in the stream as a Rattata too.
00:25:06 All in all, not much more a little Rattata who believed in himself could do.
00:25:10 That's the guy destined to fucking die, it seems like.
00:25:13 You didn't grind enough, Nate.
00:25:16 You had like a 19 and a 20, and then all your other guys were like level five, level six,
00:25:21 level two.
00:25:22 It's true.
00:25:23 I should spend more time grinding.
00:25:25 But you know what?
00:25:26 Russell was yearning for death anyway, to escape this shell that felt so wrong, whereas he
00:25:30 foolishly donated too much and caught a fucking Rattata.
00:25:33 Aren't we all?
00:25:35 All I'm saying is that I think in the Chronology of the Pokémon series, Pokémon Gold or Silver
00:25:41 takes place so far in any of our Nuzlocks featuring Russell earliest in the timeline.
00:25:45 I'm wondering if perhaps this Rattata is the original incarnation of Russell.
00:25:49 Oh, so you're saying it's the tale's been told out of chronological order.
00:25:53 Exactly.
00:25:54 It may well be.
00:25:55 What a storied history.
00:25:56 I mean, Rattata is a purple boy, becomes a purple ghost, there's connections here.
00:26:03 Who can say?
00:26:04 Who can say?
00:26:05 It's true.
00:26:06 I wanted to say, by the way, I wanted to ask you something about the comic.
00:26:08 I wanted to know what it was like drawing the final line art.
00:26:13 What was that experience like?
00:26:14 Because I know that you have always had a bit of an issue like, oh, my art is bad.
00:26:20 But your art's really good in this.
00:26:22 So how did you reconcile those two contradictory facts?
00:26:27 Well, I think due to just generally drawing a lot at the end, last few months of the last
00:26:36 year, it was good practice, good, good, all that.
00:26:40 I think with the sketches that were very robust and pretty much perfect as they were in terms
00:26:48 of structure, like where the characters were located.
00:26:51 It was just a matter of making it clean.
00:26:54 I think, I don't know, it just sort of worked out.
00:26:59 There were parts where it was like, ah, that's a little sloppy when I zoom real close in.
00:27:04 But if I focus too hard on this.
00:27:07 Never zoom in.
00:27:08 Working drawing digitally, never zoom in.
00:27:11 I zoom in a little bit.
00:27:13 It's always a mistake.
00:27:15 You always regret it.
00:27:16 Because you can see tiny little bits here and there.
00:27:17 Well, I like to zoom in just so that I can see dots that are easily get rid of a bowl.
00:27:24 Dots that are far away that were from an earlier part where I was erasing a big line.
00:27:30 I felt like doing the due diligence to clean it up a little bit before I move on.
00:27:36 But not to redraw everything because the line isn't smooth enough.
00:27:41 I'm sort of becoming more comfortable with just seeing how it goes.
00:27:47 Seeing how I draw the first few times and not redrawing too much unless it's like seriously
00:27:54 bothering me.
00:27:56 I guess my threshold for what seriously bothers me has changed.
00:28:02 Now I'm like, yeah, you know, it's not important for this to be the most beautiful thing ever.
00:28:08 Even though I did design it so that it could be potentially printed at some point as a
00:28:13 book.
00:28:14 I'm not sure how possible that would be, but that would be nice having a lot of ghosts.
00:28:19 That's how I feel with slime and punishment.
00:28:22 Not every panel needs to be a masterpiece.
00:28:25 Just fucking draw it and if it gets the most of the time it's enough just to get the idea
00:28:29 across and not look bad and that's fine.
00:28:33 I think the main thing that was different from compared to just drawings in general
00:28:39 is that I was keeping track of the size of the pen brush when doing certain things like
00:28:45 the boxes are always like 15 point when I was drawing those.
00:28:51 Oh, this is, I can talk about this afterwards, Photoshop tattled on me and told Adobe that
00:29:00 I was using a pirated version.
00:29:02 I don't know, I've seen that on my computer recently and there's a process you can kill
00:29:09 to get rid of it, but it is annoying.
00:29:12 Well, the thing it was like I was getting annoyed with Photoshop generally anyway because
00:29:16 it sort of lags a lot and sometimes it just like lags indefinitely and there's no fix
00:29:21 so I have to turn the computer off and on again for it to be okay.
00:29:25 So I was like, you know what, this is a good reason to just not have Photoshop anymore
00:29:29 and I got one of those many, many, many free alternatives.
00:29:33 What'd you get?
00:29:34 I got Medibang paint.
00:29:36 What the fuck is that?
00:29:38 It's something I heard Tom talk about once and I was like, I'll remember that, I guess.
00:29:42 And it's really good.
00:29:43 This is like the ball-pitted McDonald's version of Photoshop.
00:29:46 It sounds really good.
00:29:47 You can do basically all the same things with all the same shortcut commands, but it has
00:29:51 some improvements and it is sort of designed for writing mangas.
00:29:55 This is like Pintuol Psy 2, that's all there is.
00:29:58 I really like Mango Studio, but it did take me forever to pirate it.
00:30:02 It took me like multiple days of working on it.
00:30:05 Maybe I'm just stupid, but it's really hard.
00:30:06 The future is free shit, I guess.
00:30:09 It's a free program.
00:30:10 You can download it right now and it has this great tool where you can click a grid, like
00:30:17 an assist grid thing and it can be like straight lines or like a crisscross pattern or like
00:30:23 a radial thing or a circle thing and you align it.
00:30:26 If I wanted to draw straight lines going in one direction, such as rain, I can align
00:30:31 it to be a certain thing and then when I draw, it only goes on that specific angle.
00:30:39 So I can't fuck up the angles, which is really nice.
00:30:42 That's pretty convenient.
00:30:43 I mean, with Mango Studio, I can kind of do that by just, I rotate the canvas instead
00:30:47 of the axis and it works, I guess it would accomplish the same thing, but that's pretty
00:30:52 good.
00:30:54 Drawing digitally is so much better than traditional.
00:30:57 It's just better.
00:30:58 I don't understand why people still do traditional.
00:31:00 I think people say it's good to be well versed in both because they'll influence each other,
00:31:10 I guess.
00:31:11 Okay.
00:31:12 Or at least traditional will make you better at drawing digitally.
00:31:16 Traditional can impart a certain aesthetic, like a watercolor painting has a certain
00:31:22 feel to it, and that's cool and all, but that's bullshit and aesthetic is all bullshit
00:31:27 and it's just about getting the idea across and digital, it's just so much less complicated
00:31:33 to do it digitally.
00:31:34 Listen, I'm all for digital, but the aesthetic is part of the idea sometimes.
00:31:39 Sometimes you want to convey a certain feeling.
00:31:41 Not for me.
00:31:42 Oh, jeez.
00:31:43 I wonder, I guess that's why your art looks like that, huh, Ben?
00:31:48 Hell yes.
00:31:49 Hell yes.
00:31:50 I think I said last time, but the way I'm working with these comics is this one's going
00:32:00 to be digitally, and then I'm going to try doing one that is traditional, just to see
00:32:07 how much more difficult or easy or better it makes it because it's something I should
00:32:14 try at least.
00:32:16 I initially tried inking vapors one traditionally, and I got two pages in, and I was like, nah,
00:32:23 this isn't going to work.
00:32:25 I'm just not up to it.
00:32:27 To then scan it and do all the shit you have to fix with it anyway, I mean, fuck that.
00:32:32 I tried to use a nib pen because I had just read Bakuman, and I was like, what the fuck
00:32:36 is this thing?
00:32:39 Who made this?
00:32:40 Hey, so this comic is cool and all, but we only know any comic or piece of media is
00:32:45 as good as the memes that are generated out of it, so more importantly, let me just save
00:32:49 this comic from the dustbin of history by posting this, guys, this is literally me when
00:32:55 I'm so fucking scared.
00:32:57 This is literally me, everyone, post how this is literally you when you're so scared of
00:33:04 shit.
00:33:05 Now that we've thoroughly disrespected Hippos comic and everything about his character,
00:33:08 we can finally move on to a new fucking topic.
00:33:12 Yeah, that's fair.
00:33:13 Guys, listen, if the reason, well Hippo, do you have anything else you want to say about
00:33:17 your comic?
00:33:18 Go read it right now.
00:33:19 Go read it, yeah.
00:33:20 Very good.
00:33:21 I think we all vouch for it's quite.
00:33:22 What is the release schedule this going to be?
00:33:23 Not like, when is it going to do do do do do do do, but you're going to do page by page,
00:33:28 batch by batch.
00:33:29 I'm going to do chapters, like originally I didn't have chapters, I just sketched a bunch
00:33:33 of pages, but I'm thinking a 20 page chapter is meaty and cool.
00:33:40 It is, it is.
00:33:42 And to drop that would be like, oh my God, read the thing.
00:33:44 And I was like, yeah, hell yeah.
00:33:47 So yes.
00:33:48 Is there any time we can look forward to that in the future?
00:33:52 Do you know what I promise anything?
00:33:55 I mean, initially, like I was saying, like, optimistically, I could do 20 pages of this
00:34:01 because it's all sketched.
00:34:02 I could line it and shade it in like a week each chapter.
00:34:07 Did you say it's all sketched, like the entire thing?
00:34:10 The entire thing is sketched, like I wanted to have it finished.
00:34:14 So it's already a completed story in your mind.
00:34:16 Damn.
00:34:17 I mean, it was already a completed story when I wrote it and completed it and wrote all
00:34:21 the dialogue and like character actions in a screenplay format.
00:34:24 Well, I don't know about anybody else, but to me, that makes it be like, oh shit, this
00:34:27 thing is real and we'll be completed.
00:34:29 There's no like, I don't know what the ending is going to be, I'll figure it out.
00:34:33 That's great news.
00:34:34 You mind?
00:34:35 Yep.
00:34:36 We'll go read it, people.
00:34:38 Go to give him, take that site and read it.
00:34:40 There you go.
00:34:41 Go read all the shit.
00:34:42 Fuck you.
00:34:43 I haven't been able to do any slime and punishment work lately and because I put that on.
00:34:49 Because I put that on the back burner for the, to finish the vapors to a Kickstarter work.
00:34:55 And then I put that on the back burner because this Redcon 4 shit cropped up, but um.
00:35:00 Have you given Cassie her vaporette yet?
00:35:03 No.
00:35:04 Epic.
00:35:05 Yeah.
00:35:06 Whatever.
00:35:07 Leave me alone.
00:35:08 Hey, listen, audience, if it sounds like I'm tired right now, then there's a very good
00:35:13 reason for that because I was staying up until 4 a.m. last night to work on Lonesome Cactus,
00:35:20 which is a new bot that you can click on and play with in the Quickdraw server.
00:35:26 You remember, you may remember the old PCP drawcasts.
00:35:29 Those are dead and gone and buried, but Quickdraw is the new hotness and Lonesome Cactus is
00:35:35 just the first part of the puzzle that you can go and play with right now.
00:35:38 It is a game sort of kind of more like it's like robust discord reaction enhancements that
00:35:47 make you even more likely to whore out your body and your soul for points that mean nothing
00:35:53 and do nothing, but look cool and you be like, fuck you.
00:35:58 And it's great.
00:35:59 So click on the link in the description to be taken to the Quickdraw discord.
00:36:03 So it's like you post images as it is a drawing art server thing and people react with certain
00:36:12 emotes to indicate how much they like it and you get bounty, you get a thing, you get currency
00:36:18 for how many reactions you get to your art is the idea.
00:36:23 And depending on what reactions they give you and if you have a collab with people,
00:36:29 then they get all reactions, or they get all bounty too.
00:36:32 It's basically a point system to incentivize people to get as much like a high bounty as
00:36:37 they possibly can by creating as much art as they fucking can in this discord server,
00:36:42 which by the way, it's like tied to Quickdraw in the sense that it's tied to Quickdraw,
00:36:48 but this is just an art server.
00:36:49 So if you ever have those art servers, which everyone's in, they joined some fucking posseass
00:36:54 art server and it's always like, yeah, okay, I guess the people in here are cool, I guess
00:37:00 so, but you know in your heart of hearts, you fucking hate all of them because all of
00:37:03 them are lame sauce and all of them are veggies, you don't even fucking matter.
00:37:06 Then click on this one because this one will literally make fun of you and bully you relentlessly
00:37:11 unless you have a high bounty and a roll name and you will get a fire under your ass and
00:37:16 you will be completely obliterated unless you have a high bounty.
00:37:19 You get like a, you get a notification from Lonesome Cactus screaming at you every one
00:37:25 second.
00:37:26 Yeah, literally.
00:37:27 Well, it's great.
00:37:28 Well, it's to keep me from gaming the system hardcore, failure of a draw hack that I am
00:37:34 and just racking up massive pointage to sail by and just survive on surplus labor of others.
00:37:43 The thing is, how would you make that happen?
00:37:46 I enlist a cabal of collaborators and we all cheat the system and vote for each other.
00:37:52 Is this, can I break your game?
00:37:54 Can I ruin everyone's fun?
00:37:55 You have to spend bounty to have.
00:37:56 You already have.
00:37:57 So if you don't have your bounty to give, then you can't, like, they can't get bounty.
00:38:04 So you theoretically, I mean, theoretically, if all of your people were accruing massive
00:38:08 amounts of bounty, you know, from other people, then you would be able to spend on all one
00:38:12 another and inflate your scores.
00:38:13 But everyone fucking hates you and everyone hates all Nate heads, so no one would ever
00:38:17 give you anything.
00:38:18 That's the landscape we're dealing with right now.
00:38:23 Wait, so if I, if someone has a zero bounty and they resonate, they click the resonate
00:38:31 emote with an art piece, does that person not get any bounty?
00:38:35 No, no, they get bounty, but they get the negative bounty, which has massive ramifications
00:38:40 for their social currency.
00:38:42 They are basically like in the complete, like lower rungs of society.
00:38:47 They are in the like the half basements in parasite.
00:38:50 They are that like lower class family.
00:38:52 I don't see how this operates.
00:38:55 Like if somebody joins the server, they have zero bounty and they react to things.
00:38:59 Do people lose bounty?
00:39:01 Yes, you can theoretically go into negative bounty, but that wouldn't happen.
00:39:04 But like, surely if people join the server, then everyone will like, you know, they'll
00:39:10 react to things, not knowing this, and then everyone will just lose bounty until everyone
00:39:14 has negative bounty.
00:39:15 Wait, you lose bounty?
00:39:16 You lose bounty by reacting to stuff?
00:39:17 I don't understand the mathematics.
00:39:20 You spend way less bounty to give more.
00:39:23 So you are spending like a fourth of the bounty that you reward other people.
00:39:27 So people are all a net getting way more bounty than they are losing bounty.
00:39:32 It's merely it's merely like a system to make it so that you are at least somewhat stingy
00:39:36 with what you give out.
00:39:37 And you aren't just reacting to every single thing with the highest tier reaction.
00:39:42 Hmm.
00:39:43 Okay.
00:39:44 So confused.
00:39:45 I'll just react when I like something.
00:39:48 Trust in the cactus.
00:39:49 Exactly.
00:39:50 That's what we should do.
00:39:51 Just don't worry about it.
00:39:52 You know, it kind of seems like it's like a prisoner's dilemma sort of thing.
00:39:55 I feel like even though like the optimal play is to like be very generous with resonations,
00:40:04 and then like other people will probably be generous with them with you, and then everyone
00:40:08 will mutually benefit.
00:40:09 I wonder if it would fall into the trap of like, people, nobody reacts to anyone because
00:40:15 they want to hoard all their bounty to themselves, but then everybody suffers.
00:40:19 Well, here's the thing about bounty.
00:40:20 It literally doesn't matter outside of social currency.
00:40:23 It literally only matters for bragging rights.
00:40:26 And so you're not going to be super hoarding with it.
00:40:28 And I mean, already evidently, everyone is reacting to everything way too much already.
00:40:33 Like literally, like literally every post I'm scrolling up has like the highest tier favorite
00:40:38 reaction, literally all of them.
00:40:40 In fact, let me see how much bounty I have right now.
00:40:43 Um, I got a cool $6,000 going on $7,000.
00:40:47 That's pretty good.
00:40:48 This is why YouTube took away the star rating thing and just replaced it with like and dislike
00:40:54 because people would only vote for five stars and one star.
00:40:57 Yeah, basically.
00:40:58 Nobody was like, hmm, three and a half stars.
00:41:01 Yeah.
00:41:02 Well, none the less.
00:41:03 Well, there you go.
00:41:04 Go investigate and be an outlaw.
00:41:07 Yes.
00:41:08 Come and be an outlaw and roam the territory deserts of Arizona and try to avoid the sheriffs
00:41:15 trying to take you back to Fort Whipple.
00:41:16 It's a great grand adventure.
00:41:18 I am curious.
00:41:19 Right.
00:41:20 That does sound great.
00:41:21 What is the lore of the Lonesome Cactus?
00:41:22 What is his authority in this town?
00:41:23 The Lonesome Cactus is merely a Lonesome Cactus, who, you know, is able to assist in the development
00:41:30 of young independent content creators such as yourself for a small price, which may or
00:41:35 may not be your soul, which may or may not be your dignity or, you know, your mortal coil.
00:41:40 We'll have to wait and see.
00:41:41 We'll have to see what kind of deal this Lonesome Cactus is to us.
00:41:45 It slurps up mortal coils like spaghetti noodles.
00:41:48 Maybe one day, if enough of his new friends move out and start creating art, he won't
00:41:52 be so lonesome after all.
00:41:54 Something tells...
00:41:55 You like it, though.
00:41:56 Well, I imagine that he's, like, recetti, so he can, like, burrow underground and, like,
00:41:59 move wherever he wants.
00:42:00 So if someone tries to come over and talk to him, like, outside of asking for roles,
00:42:04 he'll just, like, burrow underground and then walk away and just, like, go.
00:42:07 He's lonesome because he obliterated all the competition.
00:42:10 Yeah, exactly.
00:42:11 Well, that makes sense.
00:42:12 This guy was the original artist.
00:42:13 He created drawing.
00:42:14 Oh, maybe he did in fact obliterate all the competition, but he learned that, like, no,
00:42:17 no, no, this is no way to live.
00:42:18 I'm lonesome now as a result of my misdeeds.
00:42:21 I was too powerful.
00:42:22 I need to encourage others to also be artists and foster community.
00:42:26 Do you think he dips his needles in ink to write?
00:42:31 Ooh, yes, I do.
00:42:33 Ooh, he can draw so many things at once.
00:42:36 Yeah.
00:42:38 Do you think he's a piotic cactus?
00:42:40 Do you think you could, like, bite into him and then you get, like, super high-yags?
00:42:43 Yeah, exactly.
00:42:44 That'd be awesome.
00:42:45 Yeah, I mean, that lobe on his head, I mean, that's weed, if ever there was weed.
00:42:50 Have you seen, oh God, I don't know if I want to change the topic, but I'm gonna talk about
00:42:57 it.
00:42:58 We're done with this one.
00:42:59 It's over.
00:43:00 I was gonna talk about Pokemon.
00:43:01 I was gonna talk about Pokemon.
00:43:02 Sure.
00:43:03 Just go ahead.
00:43:04 Have you seen it?
00:43:05 Everyone click on the link and go there now because Quick Draw is actually cool now,
00:43:06 and the drawcast is actually cool now because it's not on the PC, it's a real thing.
00:43:10 We're actually doing it again.
00:43:11 It's actually alive again.
00:43:12 It's epic.
00:43:13 It's pretty epic.
00:43:14 It's online.
00:43:15 Episodes aren't being recorded as well.
00:43:17 Episodes and new shows are being conceived of and recorded, so, fucking, Quick Draw has
00:43:21 a crazy future.
00:43:25 So do you guys see the Pokemon news?
00:43:27 No.
00:43:28 I heard some of it.
00:43:29 I missed all the details.
00:43:30 Who fucking cares?
00:43:31 Is it good?
00:43:32 Is it bad?
00:43:33 It's kind of funny.
00:43:34 It's kind of funny.
00:43:35 Wow.
00:43:36 Basically they're really, okay, I might be a little, the general idea is they're releasing
00:43:41 like DLC that has all the fucking Pokemon that they withheld from the first release.
00:43:45 Lemau, who could have possibly, who could have possibly guessed?
00:43:48 It's not all of them, but it's a bunch of them, as I understand it.
00:43:50 Who could have possibly guessed that they didn't need to withhold all those Pokemon?
00:43:54 They were just doing it to make more money.
00:43:56 What an absolute shock.
00:43:58 That is unfortunate.
00:43:59 I mean, it, this, oh god, it's so disgraceful that they did interviews and said like, no,
00:44:07 Only to immediately assume is the game is that it'd be like, huh, no, we were just trying.
00:44:12 It was a lie.
00:44:13 We're just trying to milk more out of you.
00:44:16 And like, honestly, I would respect it so much more if they had just said, yeah, we're
00:44:21 withholding it because we're going to release them as DLC.
00:44:23 They just did fucking admit it.
00:44:24 You fucking cowards.
00:44:27 Even worse though, because like they like had a different excuse after the technical
00:44:33 limitations.
00:44:34 They said, Oh for balance reasons.
00:44:36 You know, it's hard to balance so many Pokemon, but they're putting them in there.
00:44:40 So like, you had to have balanced them.
00:44:42 Yeah.
00:44:43 You did all the work.
00:44:44 Don't get me wrong.
00:44:45 I don't respect how weasely they seem to be.
00:44:47 However, all these things could be part of the decision that like, it takes more effort
00:44:51 to put more Pokemon in.
00:44:53 Okay, true.
00:44:54 Balance.
00:44:55 I mean, okay, sure.
00:44:56 That could be part of the thing.
00:44:57 And ultimately, you know, it takes more work to get more Pokemon in the game.
00:45:01 There's updated textures and it's shit to some degree.
00:45:04 So I mean, is it embarrassing?
00:45:05 Absolutely.
00:45:06 I'm just saying, no, I'm just saying they lied, okay?
00:45:10 I'm just saying, well, maybe I know.
00:45:11 I'm just saying, like, okay, obviously I wouldn't like it if they were gonna like, section
00:45:17 off, cordon off certain Pokemon and only give them with DLC.
00:45:20 I would never like that, but it wouldn't offend me if they hadn't like, lied about it.
00:45:25 I am not seeing a clear lie.
00:45:27 Maybe we just disagree on this.
00:45:28 They said it was for technical limitations and it's just not.
00:45:31 It's just not.
00:45:32 I think not.
00:45:33 It cannot possibly be that.
00:45:34 They kept changing their story.
00:45:35 Yes.
00:45:36 Also, and further evidences that apparently they changed their story.
00:45:41 I think, boy, I mean, I also think it's a terrible thing just generally.
00:45:47 But I think the argument if to play devil's advocate, stop, to play devil's advocate.
00:45:55 The argument is that they couldn't develop it in the time for technical.
00:46:02 It wasn't like it's impossible to port them over.
00:46:04 It's like they need to remake them and that's why it took so long and it took so long.
00:46:08 So that, you know, they have to get a Pokemon game out.
00:46:11 It's not good, but like, I think it's not technically a lie, but you should treat it
00:46:16 like one because it's fucking.
00:46:18 Okay.
00:46:19 Okay.
00:46:20 Well, all right.
00:46:21 So the Pokemon company is terrible now.
00:46:23 It's bad.
00:46:24 I, you know, you, you know what, okay, I don't, do we like Arlo?
00:46:28 I kind of, I sometimes I like Arlo.
00:46:30 I watched some Arlo videos about Pokemon.
00:46:32 He is Keto Ben.
00:46:33 He is pretty.
00:46:34 He's not full Keto, but he dabbles.
00:46:36 He's fine.
00:46:37 But he's fine.
00:46:38 Arlo will be destroyed by, when I, when I get like, you know, some red felt and I make
00:46:45 red man the puppet and he reviews games, Arlo will be dead within minutes.
00:46:49 That sounds good.
00:46:50 He did a bunch of videos about covering Sword and Shield.
00:46:54 He's fine.
00:46:55 Yeah.
00:46:56 He's fine.
00:46:57 He, but he did a bunch of videos covering Sword and Shield and he said some stuff that
00:46:59 really struck.
00:47:00 I was like, oh my God, he's onto something here.
00:47:02 And it was basically that like, Nintendo is like, I guess I just never thought about
00:47:08 this before.
00:47:09 I mean, every generation, they add like cool new features, but they take old good features
00:47:15 away.
00:47:16 Like they're not, they're obviously not just trying to make the series as good as it can
00:47:19 be.
00:47:20 The strategy is to add features to every generation and then take them away later so that every
00:47:27 generation has like certain things about it that only it has.
00:47:31 They're kind of creating like an illusion of progress by doing that.
00:47:35 No, it's not, it's not that it's, it's sort of the opposite.
00:47:39 It's like, okay, well yeah, Heart, Gold, Soul, Silver, that's the one with the Pokemon
00:47:45 that follow you.
00:47:46 Sword and Shield, that's the one with the Dynamaxing.
00:47:49 It's not, they're not, they're like deliberately not making progress and adding more stuff to
00:47:53 make the game better.
00:47:54 They're deliberately like, they add something and they take it away to make every generation,
00:47:59 such that every generation doesn't like obsolete the previous ones.
00:48:04 In Galar, it has to be side grades.
00:48:06 In other words, in other words, they don't want to make the games too good because it
00:48:11 would make their old games look worse by comparison.
00:48:13 And also it would set the bar too high.
00:48:15 Like I don't, why do they have to worry about depreciating value for stuff that is old?
00:48:19 I mean, it's not like fire red, green, being ugly, overshadow is really going to cause
00:48:23 new problems for them, is it?
00:48:24 Well maybe it's more just about not setting expectations too high or just, yeah, I don't
00:48:30 know.
00:48:31 Do you think, maybe they're not that concerned with sales of old games, I'm sure they make
00:48:36 relatively less money on things like that.
00:48:39 I kind of feel like a lot of this is a feature creep that, like if they had Megas, Anzi moves
00:48:44 and Dynamax, then it's just a lot to do when you make new games.
00:48:48 Well I wouldn't have added all of those things if they had kept the ones from when they started
00:48:53 adding special delinquent.
00:48:55 Like they could have, instead of doing Z moves, they could have just made more Megas.
00:49:00 If that's what they were going to go with.
00:49:02 Sure, sure.
00:49:03 You're right.
00:49:04 There's definitely flaws.
00:49:05 It is definitely a marketing thing.
00:49:06 Like, oh, the new Pokemon game, it's not just the same as the old one.
00:49:09 We got this new thing that makes them different aside from more than new Pokemon.
00:49:14 It's explicitly a native thing, Dynamaxing is only in Galar, can you Dynamax?
00:49:19 So that certainly fits the pattern there.
00:49:23 I don't know, I think they said I was watching the Arlo and he got the game and he was like,
00:49:28 I haven't played a Pokemon game in like eight years.
00:49:31 I didn't play any of the last three generations and he's like, he booted up Sword and Shield
00:49:35 and he was like, oh my God, it's still the same?
00:49:39 It hasn't changed that much?
00:49:42 How disappointing?
00:49:43 And I was like, yep, I'm kind of sick of it.
00:49:46 I'm kind of fucking over it.
00:49:48 It's bad.
00:49:49 I feel like I decided this like 300 episodes ago on this very podcast.
00:49:52 I know, but then someone else said it and I was mad all over again.
00:49:56 Well then why don't you go watch that guy's video?
00:49:59 No, to only watch this channel.
00:50:01 I'm here to do reporting on what he said.
00:50:05 Listen, I'm here to regurgitate content creators' videos for the mass market.
00:50:10 I'm just, I'm only expressing all this because I strongly share the opinion and am upset
00:50:14 about it and it bugs me and I don't like it.
00:50:18 Did you see the new legendary or the new like mystical mythical Pokemon?
00:50:22 I did see that.
00:50:23 The one like the deer with like the giant ball on its head?
00:50:26 Hideous.
00:50:27 I like that one.
00:50:28 I actually like that one a lot.
00:50:30 That's pretty funny.
00:50:31 Okay.
00:50:32 Such as with old Pokemon discussions is like, fuck Pokemon, fuck, they suck, but I kind
00:50:38 of love them though.
00:50:39 That's my thing to talk about.
00:50:42 Yeah.
00:50:43 This is, I think the thing, I mean, most people just buy Pokemon are like, oh good,
00:50:46 the new one.
00:50:47 I like Pokemon generically.
00:50:48 I will buy this.
00:50:49 That's most people.
00:50:50 Anyway, he talks about Pokemon and how much they like or dislike Pokemon are literally
00:50:55 the most fucking caveman brain dead sex of shit corpses on.
00:51:01 Yeah.
00:51:02 Speaking of which.
00:51:03 Speaking of which.
00:51:04 And yes, I am talking about you.
00:51:05 It just fucking, it just makes me so upset when I realize they're not trying to make
00:51:09 a good game.
00:51:10 That's not what they want to do.
00:51:11 They don't give a shit.
00:51:12 They don't care if it's good.
00:51:15 Ah, it just has to be good enough.
00:51:17 It's just the first gigantic thing that has been around for like decades.
00:51:22 It's a lot of money tied to it.
00:51:24 Like they've got to make, they've got to string it out for as long as possible.
00:51:27 Think about what it means.
00:51:28 If you want a good game, you go to a gamer that likes playing them.
00:51:31 Like what is, what is the perfect Pokemon game?
00:51:34 Like it's, it's probably, like what we'll get the most sales, it's probably not like
00:51:37 kind of what we envision with like, I think these things that like fan hacks or whatever
00:51:41 where they make it like really challenging.
00:51:43 Maybe like a more interesting story.
00:51:44 I'm not, I'm not even talking about challenge.
00:51:46 I'm just talking about like, don't fucking gut your own games and like take out good features.
00:51:51 Like they had a writable Pokemon in, in Pikachu, hey you Pikachu.
00:51:56 They could have had it in Sword and Shield if they wanted to.
00:51:59 They didn't.
00:52:00 Why?
00:52:01 Because it, because it doesn't matter.
00:52:03 Like like including good features that people like, like that's not what it's about.
00:52:06 It's just about like making the new one, making it different enough.
00:52:10 And it doesn't matter if you, if you add or if you take away.
00:52:12 It's all the same.
00:52:13 It all comes out in the wash.
00:52:14 I think we can all agree that does seem to be pushed and how it comes out.
00:52:19 You know, the worst thing, obviously, obviously the worst thing is that they're successful
00:52:23 because of them doing this.
00:52:25 I'm sure this is like a calculate, you know, a calculation that has proved to be true every
00:52:30 single time they do it.
00:52:32 They still make lots of money and from all the games being slightly different, but none
00:52:36 of them being like straight upgrades, except the remakes, because that's an opportunity
00:52:40 to hype up, like selling a really old game that nobody would potentially buy on the old
00:52:45 console.
00:52:46 Although I wonder if your Omega Sapphire and Rubies are actually better than the original
00:52:49 because they're filled with, I mean, I didn't play them, seems like they're filled with
00:52:52 bloat and bullshit.
00:52:53 I don't know if I could be wrong.
00:52:54 I think so.
00:52:55 I haven't played all of it.
00:52:56 I've played it in a little bit because of nostalgia, but it's like.
00:52:59 I mean, Shea Mei's seven hour review of Pokemon Omega Root.
00:53:02 I don't remember if he ends up deciding that the remake is better or worse than the original.
00:53:06 Was it kind of a toss-up though?
00:53:07 Was there even, like, it wasn't clear?
00:53:09 Because Heart Gold is, like, basically straight up better than Gold and Silver.
00:53:13 He definitely had some things that really annoyed him about the remake.
00:53:17 I don't remember if he ever goes so far as to be like, the remake is worse.
00:53:21 I just forget it's been a while.
00:53:24 Fair enough.
00:53:25 Oh, oh, oh, my old bone lake when I think about Pokemon.
00:53:30 Huh?
00:53:31 Oh, I'm just letting the audience know.
00:53:34 There.
00:53:35 No more Pokemon.
00:53:36 You could skip to this part of the video to skip the Pokemon discussion.
00:53:39 Oh, God.
00:53:40 Yeah.
00:53:41 Okay.
00:53:42 Well, I'm sorry, everybody.
00:53:43 Oh, jeez.
00:53:44 Hey, I've got a tangent to say, which is just out.
00:53:46 Guys, let me tell you about a little guy that everybody loves named Jordan Peterson.
00:53:50 Oh, God.
00:53:51 No, God.
00:53:52 Okay, no, no, no, no.
00:53:53 Okay, all right.
00:53:54 Why?
00:53:55 The story at the point is I cleaned my room, guys, therefore I'm up right now.
00:53:59 I did it.
00:54:00 You know what?
00:54:01 Hey, you guys heard this last name, Mari Kondo?
00:54:02 Yeah, you could live.
00:54:03 Oh, yeah.
00:54:04 That's a queen.
00:54:05 That's a queen.
00:54:06 You fucking sex.
00:54:07 You know.
00:54:08 I mean, I want Mari Kondo and Jordan Peterson to, like, have children for the ultimate cleaning
00:54:12 machine.
00:54:13 She seems like she'd be a fun mom.
00:54:15 Too bad she's already...
00:54:16 Imagine this.
00:54:17 She's already spent 99% of her eggs.
00:54:19 I guess that's what become a great meme.
00:54:23 That is a great meme.
00:54:24 It is.
00:54:25 It is a great meme.
00:54:26 I can't remember.
00:54:27 I made a really epic joke.
00:54:28 Okay, whatever.
00:54:29 You just summed it up with that.
00:54:30 Point is, me and Michelle have just been cleaning, and I just got to say, it is certainly
00:54:34 a truism that when your house is dirty and then you spend a while cleaning it, it just
00:54:38 feels better afterward.
00:54:39 So highly recommended.
00:54:41 Do it.
00:54:42 Funny enough.
00:54:43 Do it.
00:54:44 Live in a clean place.
00:54:45 I also clean my room.
00:54:46 Not entirely, but, like, yeah, I put a lot of my stuff away and I clean up a lot of space.
00:54:51 I was inspired to do this because I made a genius-level purchasing decision.
00:54:55 Let me explain what's the most exciting thing in my life right now.
00:54:59 So my room.
00:55:00 Nate, have you been to my room?
00:55:01 No, but we did see that epic room tour that Zenn Huckstable made for Michelle upon request.
00:55:07 I never retweeted that.
00:55:08 I'm so fucking mad.
00:55:09 What are you doing there, buddy?
00:55:10 I can't believe I wasn't there for Christmas.
00:55:11 It makes me so upset.
00:55:12 There was so much shit going down.
00:55:13 That is too bad.
00:55:14 It was sad because Nate and Michelle had to go, like, right away.
00:55:17 Like, me and Tom and Zenn hung out and had anti-pasto platters.
00:55:22 We were very sad together.
00:55:23 It was a bummer.
00:55:24 It had to be done.
00:55:25 We had a pretty good time.
00:55:26 But anyway.
00:55:27 Next time.
00:55:28 Next time.
00:55:29 Yeah.
00:55:30 But anyway, my room has, like, you know, it's got, like, a little sort of alcove corner
00:55:36 to it.
00:55:37 It's only, like, maybe three feet wide and it sticks back, like, four or five feet into
00:55:41 the wall and it's got, like, a little angled half ceiling.
00:55:44 It's just, like, a little, like, nook that I just keep, like, shelves over there with
00:55:47 books and stuff on them.
00:55:49 Sure.
00:55:50 And so I purchased a tension rod.
00:55:51 You know what that is?
00:55:52 I don't.
00:55:53 I don't.
00:55:54 It's, like, a metal rod that's, like, spring-loaded and you can put it.
00:55:58 You basically just wedge it between two walls and you can use it to, like, put up a shower
00:56:02 curtain or something.
00:56:03 Yeah.
00:56:04 So I bought one of those and then I got a bunch of coat hangers and my closet was stuffed
00:56:09 with thing and now I have a rod because, like, my closet is, like, it's, like, a little,
00:56:13 like, low half closet.
00:56:16 It's only, like, a couple feet high.
00:56:17 I have, like, a little, like, a long, horizontal, low closet.
00:56:20 So now I hung up this tension rod.
00:56:22 So now I have all my hangable clothes over on the nook hung up.
00:56:27 And also they form sort of a little makeshift curtain that I have to sort of part to get
00:56:33 into the nook.
00:56:34 It's, like, in the adult section of an old, like, DVD shop.
00:56:38 And also, because I just went to the garment district and I bought a bunch of cool items
00:56:43 from the women's section, Lamal.
00:56:45 And one of them was a sweater that has, like, a cool, like, skeleton ribcage pattern on
00:56:51 the front.
00:56:52 Whoa.
00:56:53 And I hung that on the front of the rack.
00:56:56 So now I have this, like, cool skeleton pattern sweater prominently displayed in my room.
00:57:01 And it makes me feel pretty edgy.
00:57:03 What a life upgrade.
00:57:04 Can we get a picture of this set up, perhaps?
00:57:05 Yeah, please.
00:57:06 You want it right now?
00:57:07 I mean, hey, take your time, but at some point.
00:57:08 Yeah, I know.
00:57:09 I'll take one right now.
00:57:10 Your room is so fucking small, Ben, that I can't even imagine this device, this major
00:57:15 operation taking up any space inside of it.
00:57:17 Is it that small?
00:57:19 Yeah.
00:57:20 I don't know.
00:57:21 It is.
00:57:22 It's pretty small.
00:57:23 It's pretty, you know, okay.
00:57:25 The L-Cove makes it, like, technically, I think, normal size, but, like, it feels much
00:57:30 smaller because the L-Cove is so, like, jetted off to the side that it doesn't really feel
00:57:34 like it's part of anything.
00:57:35 Maybe I missed this part, but, like, what's the gain here?
00:57:39 I'm not quite understanding the benefit of this set up.
00:57:43 Well, I created new storage space to hang my clothes in.
00:57:48 And also, I just like that it's like a little curtain, a little hangable clothes curtain
00:57:54 in front of my book nook.
00:57:56 All right, if anyone wants to know how to visualize Ben's room, here's how you do it.
00:57:59 You get a cheese wheel, you make a slice of cheese from the cheese wheel, then at the
00:58:04 broad base of it, here's this computer at the tiny little sliver a little in, there's
00:58:08 just, like, a mattress on the floor, and that's Ben's room.
00:58:11 That's, oh, and then a bunch of caffeine pills and, like, vape cartridges just scattered
00:58:16 across every single place.
00:58:17 Hell yeah, dude.
00:58:18 That's the life.
00:58:19 Dirt cheap E-Fox.
00:58:20 Dirt cheap E-Fox.
00:58:22 Dirt cheap E-Fox.
00:58:24 No, everyone.
00:58:25 Channel Marie Kondo.
00:58:27 You're perfectly politically neutral, cleanliness individual.
00:58:31 Be her.
00:58:32 It brings you joy.
00:58:33 And, you know, Michelle, I said this before, but, like, we've been trying to just get rid
00:58:36 of shit we don't need because only keep things that spark joy.
00:58:40 If you've got a bunch of crap, there's, like, a bunch of boxes that are, like, anime figurine
00:58:44 boxes, I think to myself, oh, I might want those boxes one day to pack up my anime figurines.
00:58:49 You think I will ever use those?
00:58:50 No.
00:58:51 You should get rid of them.
00:58:52 They're a waste of space and a waste of time.
00:58:54 Bigger space to live in will make you happier, so do that.
00:58:57 Wait, you do that to point your anime figurines?
00:58:58 Bigger place to put incense and candles to pray to Jesus.
00:59:02 That's right.
00:59:03 We could have a whole shrine to Saint Jude or whatever.
00:59:06 We could have a tired chapel in your house if you just cleaned up your fucking room,
00:59:09 Nate.
00:59:10 You could literally get a mast.
00:59:11 I posted the room picture.
00:59:12 Where's your tablet, Ben?
00:59:15 The tablet is, it's, okay, I'm actually lying on my bed right now and I have the tablet
00:59:19 on the floor in front of my bed.
00:59:22 What?
00:59:23 Yeah.
00:59:24 Oh, that incredible, look at that, look at that Nuzlocke team poster there.
00:59:27 Yeah, but that's good stuff.
00:59:29 Nat blasphemous, yeah.
00:59:30 But yes, that rack is great.
00:59:33 I'm sure that makes space.
00:59:34 And then there's Nobby's Nalacacum art over small, small prints right next to the rod.
00:59:39 Wait, Nobby?
00:59:41 Yeah.
00:59:42 Um, Ben.
00:59:43 That little postcard.
00:59:44 What?
00:59:45 I drew that.
00:59:46 Is that wrong?
00:59:47 No, you fucking moron.
00:59:48 Not that one.
00:59:49 The other one.
00:59:50 You fucking dipshit.
00:59:51 You piece of shit.
00:59:53 You motherfucker.
00:59:54 Get the fuck out of here.
00:59:55 I don't even see it.
00:59:56 I think I don't know.
00:59:57 Oh, I see it.
00:59:58 Oh, way in the back there.
00:59:59 Way in the back.
01:00:00 Yes, yours is under the picture of Rando from Lisa, indeed.
01:00:03 I mean, you mean can man, right?
01:00:05 Yeah.
01:00:06 That's right.
01:00:07 Yeah, okay.
01:00:08 I mean, can man.
01:00:09 Fuck can man.
01:00:10 Let's talk about, is that pink or is that like green and purple over there?
01:00:16 My original Spike Cosplay that I sewed myself and I revealed fabulously a burning thing.
01:00:21 No, that is, that is, while I was at the fucking garment district, I just bought a green and
01:00:28 a purple handkerchief because I thought they would be cool to add to outfits at, is it
01:00:32 because you like green and purple, green and purple, you know, like weed at RFC KCon.
01:00:39 I was cleaning out my room because that's the way I want to say, that's why I went to
01:00:42 Garment District.
01:00:43 So I went to Garment District to buy one pants that fit because I didn't have any and two
01:00:47 cool outfits to wear to RFC KCon and I got that skeleton sweater and I got a cool like
01:00:52 hood that makes me look like some kind of like cultist and, and it's pretty great.
01:00:57 And I got them all in the women's section, women's clothes are better.
01:01:01 They're more interesting.
01:01:02 Yeah.
01:01:03 True.
01:01:04 When they can fit.
01:01:05 I found, I found so many great plaid shirts in the women's section that were like beautiful
01:01:09 colors and I was like, I love these so much.
01:01:11 I want to wear them, but they were all, even the ones that were large, even like large
01:01:15 size ones were like too small and didn't fit on my body.
01:01:18 They're like cut differently.
01:01:19 And I cried.
01:01:20 Yeah.
01:01:21 Yeah.
01:01:22 I cried.
01:01:23 I cried.
01:01:24 That's it.
01:01:25 It's the end of the story.
01:01:26 Hey, hey, viewer, listen, hey, audience member, listen the fuck up today.

01:01:52 real life gang violence, which is happening right now in the RFC K channel.
01:01:56 Go there right now, right now, right now, right now, right fucking now.
01:02:00 Click on the link in the description.
01:02:03 Show notes.
01:02:04 There you go.
01:02:05 It'll be the X.
01:02:06 Oh, by the way, I want to say that I was cleaning my room because a family member is going
01:02:10 to be living in my room while I'm away at college and we're going to switch out.
01:02:15 And so I've been cleaning out my room and I've been trying to make it less, you know,
01:02:19 I'm trying to make it more presentable to the people and more easy to mold in their
01:02:24 own.
01:02:25 So I've been taking down all my posters.
01:02:26 I've just been trying to make it as, you know, as base and stock and diplomatic as humanly
01:02:30 possible.
01:02:31 And I've been shifting through all of my possessions because I had forgotten that I had possessions
01:02:36 because I took like literally nothing to college and my room had just been completely
01:02:40 bare.
01:02:41 Like there's basically no furniture inside of it.
01:02:42 There's literally nothing.
01:02:43 You look at my roommate's side and he has a bunch of posters and he has a bunch of
01:02:46 like knick-knacks and stuff.
01:02:47 And look over at mine and mine's like a bed, a desk, a computer.
01:02:50 And that is literally it.
01:02:51 There's nothing else there.
01:02:52 I'm like, oh my God, I have like books.
01:02:54 I have like a globe.
01:02:56 I have all these things.
01:02:57 I want to take it all back.
01:02:58 Oh, I missed having furniture in my room.
01:03:01 It's cool.
01:03:02 And it's pretty good, right?
01:03:04 You got any shit on your walls at your dorm?
01:03:06 No, I have literally nothing on my, on my wall.
01:03:09 Because that's, that's sad.
01:03:11 That's really sad.
01:03:12 There's a legendary clip you should hear, Munchy, when it's a flashback in Metal Gear
01:03:16 Solid 2, when Ryden is fucking around, he's talking to Rose, and Rose describes the legendary
01:03:22 event where she first entered his bedroom, like he's at an apartment, it's fine, but
01:03:26 then she enters the bedroom.
01:03:27 And he's, by the way, he's a war orphan, a child soldier, and he walks into his room
01:03:31 and he's just, there's nothing there but a bed.
01:03:34 And she takes this as a big yikes, as a big oof, and it makes him very spooky and scary.
01:03:41 So just so you know, this is how you are perceived by the people in your life, whether they say
01:03:45 it or not.
01:03:46 That's really fine.
01:03:47 Yeah, okay, great, great.
01:03:48 Having, okay, listen.
01:03:49 You are a child soldier of the PCP, so it's fitting, frankly.
01:03:50 This is a pretty human core thing to say, and we're gonna kill me if you want.
01:03:54 And I'm not like a su, up until very recently, I've been very anti-possession, very anti-like
01:04:00 buying things that isn't an experience and slash or food.
01:04:04 And that's all been cool and, you know, buying consumables, I guess, is alright, is like
01:04:07 a philosophical outlook.
01:04:09 But there is something to be said, I have this tiny little tiki statue right next to
01:04:15 my computer, and this little tiki statue gives me joy whenever I look at him.
01:04:20 So maybe, maybe kids, when you go out in the town with your friends, don't spend all of
01:04:24 your money on cheeseburgers, maybe buy a tiki statue instead.
01:04:30 I like little things like that.
01:04:32 I still have, I think it was from Radcon 3, oh no, it would have been from the Barone
01:04:38 Con.
01:04:39 One of the times where we met up, I still have that squishy Kirby from, yes, yes, yes, yes.
01:04:48 And he's been on my desk and every so often, I squish him and I'm like, ah, memories.
01:04:52 And also, it just is a nice cute thing.
01:04:55 I am way too into like keeping things.
01:04:59 I really don't need, not in just like a, you know, a whatever sense, but if it has like
01:05:03 a historical value to me, I have like a drawer, like near my desk, that's just full of like
01:05:09 historic artifacts and I can pull it out and there's like plane trips that I like, like
01:05:13 plane tickets to places where I went and I have like little like knickknacks and stuff.
01:05:18 I keep, I keep all my receipts.
01:05:20 I don't know why.
01:05:22 It's not like I need them.
01:05:24 I just like, oh, I remember going to that restaurant and getting that thing and costing
01:05:28 exactly that much.
01:05:29 Yeah.
01:05:30 I have a ton of movie stubs and stuff like that where it's like, oh dude, remember when
01:05:34 I saw the emoji movie?
01:05:35 I remember that.
01:05:36 What a great time.
01:05:37 What a fucking godforsaken night.
01:05:41 It's pretty awesome.
01:05:42 I really, you know, hold on.
01:05:43 I'm going to rustle through.
01:05:44 One second.
01:05:45 Let me, let me pull out the first thing that I see over here.
01:05:49 Oh, oh, oh.
01:05:50 Any day now, chief.
01:05:52 I have a breeze card, which is the Georgia Atlanta, like public transport.
01:06:01 It's the Atlanta shitty version of a Charlie card.
01:06:03 Yeah.
01:06:04 It's the Atlanta.
01:06:05 That was a nightmare.
01:06:06 Dude.
01:06:07 Okay.
01:06:08 Getting from the plane to your house.
01:06:09 Such a pale, such a pale ghost of an imitation of the, of the, of the MBTA.
01:06:14 Yeah.
01:06:15 What a fucking nightmare.
01:06:16 Okay.
01:06:17 One last note about clean your house and we can go to wherever Nate is dying to talk
01:06:19 about.
01:06:20 Cause I know I can hear it in his fucking voice while cleaning out my room.
01:06:25 I found a mysterious artifact, which was not its original location, which means that someone
01:06:31 must have moved it, which means that I'm a ghost now because it was my, you know, like
01:06:38 baby shoes never worn.
01:06:39 It was my fleshlight never used.
01:06:42 And I bought it in a tent spit of shame and dysphoria.
01:06:47 And I decided that it was not the kind of man that I wanted to be, but I already bought
01:06:50 it.
01:06:51 So there's nothing I could do about it.
01:06:52 And so I put it away.
01:06:53 I put it away.
01:06:54 Like, like, like, like, like the Ark of the Covenant sealing it away amongst of my many
01:06:58 artifacts, never to be taken out and used again until I found it and not its real location.
01:07:04 So everyone knows, everyone fucking knows that I was once a coomer and that that side
01:07:08 of me is brazen to the world and to a fully, you know, dismiss myself from it.
01:07:13 I offered to my friend Kyle on New Year's and he did a shot out of my fleshlight and
01:07:17 it was incredible.
01:07:18 Ew.
01:07:19 That's so disgusting.
01:07:20 That's so far.
01:07:21 I saw that.
01:07:22 It was clean.
01:07:23 It was unused, bro.
01:07:24 It was clean.
01:07:25 It was cringed, dude.
01:07:26 It's cringed.
01:07:27 On a conceptual level, that is repulsive.
01:07:28 Listen, I hate absolutely everything about that.
01:07:31 Me too.
01:07:32 No.
01:07:33 Dude, I fucking hate you, man.
01:07:34 Yeah.
01:07:35 Nah, bra.
01:07:36 Nah, bra.
01:07:37 Nah, bra.
01:07:38 You gotta get the fuck outta here.
01:07:40 I'm gonna put this in the description.
01:07:43 Hold on.
01:07:44 All right.
01:07:45 Wait, what are you gonna put?
01:07:46 What are you gonna put?
01:07:47 Ew.
01:07:48 No.
01:07:49 Bro.
01:07:50 It's a video of him doing it.
01:07:51 No.
01:07:52 Watch it.
01:07:53 Kyle, shout out.
01:07:54 Shout to you, Kyle.
01:07:55 Oh, it's horrible.
01:07:56 No, it's great.
01:07:57 Oh, it's heinous.
01:07:58 Why?
01:07:59 Why is it heinous?
01:08:00 Ew.
01:08:01 Look into it, Ben.
01:08:02 Look into it, Ben.
01:08:03 See, there's a reason I see people around him.
01:08:04 I see people covering his eyes and not acknowledging it.
01:08:05 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:08:06 Please stop.
01:08:07 Bruh.
01:08:08 I don't know why.
01:08:09 This really fucking bugs me out.
01:08:10 I hate it so much.
01:08:11 Ben, do you want the flashlight?
01:08:12 Yes, please.
01:08:13 Do you actually?
01:08:14 I'll literally give it to you.
01:08:15 I don't care.
01:08:16 No, I do not want the flashlight.
01:08:17 Why?
01:08:18 Why?
01:08:19 Does anyone hate why?
01:08:20 Oh, oh, wait.
01:08:21 To drink out of, of course.
01:08:22 Oh, my God.
01:08:23 Oh, my God.
01:08:24 The perfect idea.
01:08:25 Guys, an auction, PCP fans, if you want my flashlight, then make the highest bidding
01:08:31 in the comments and then I will follow up with you.
01:08:34 You got to bring it to RAGCon4, dude.
01:08:35 You got to bring it to RAGCon4.
01:08:36 Yeah.
01:08:37 Oh, my God.
01:08:38 We got to have the group.
01:08:39 The group fuck.
01:08:40 This is actually happening.
01:08:41 No.
01:08:42 Okay, guys.
01:08:43 No.
01:08:44 Put dollar sign, you know, your bid in the comments and I will follow up after, like,
01:08:47 a week.
01:08:48 I will follow up with the highest bidder.
01:08:49 Here you go.
01:08:50 This is a munchy thing.
01:08:51 Not a me thing.
01:08:52 Just no.
01:08:53 No, this is the same thing.
01:08:54 No, I actually discussed this with Nate previous to the show and he begged me to do it.
01:08:57 This is actually just a cover.
01:08:58 This is actually his flashlight.
01:08:59 Yeah, we're doing a good cop, bad cop routine right now.
01:09:01 Give him the salty and the sweet.
01:09:03 You know, that, you know, there you go.
01:09:05 Just like the french fry milkshakes.
01:09:07 There it is.
01:09:08 Yeah.
01:09:09 Bringing it all the way back around.
01:09:11 Sadly, if you cross section the flashlight, you won't get the delicious ice cream, delicious
01:09:14 french fries.
01:09:15 You'll just get rum and coke and cum and blood and sweat.
01:09:19 If you cross section the flashlight, you won't get the delicious ice cream, delicious french
01:09:22 fries.
01:09:23 You'll just get rum and coke and cum and blood and sweat.
01:09:27 Which is equally delicious, in my opinion.
01:09:32 I was looking in my drawer.
01:09:34 The first thing I picked out was a Chipotle thing.
01:09:37 Oh!
01:09:38 On the back though.
01:09:39 Front rack on three.
01:09:41 Let me try.
01:09:42 I don't think there's like a date on it.
01:09:44 It was 750.
01:09:45 It was a chicken ball and my host was Soraya.
01:09:47 The fuck is a chicken ball?
01:09:48 Chicken ball.
01:09:49 I don't know.
01:09:50 It's a rice ball.
01:09:51 Oh wait.
01:09:52 No, no.
01:09:53 Here's the date.
01:09:54 The eighth.
01:09:55 All right.
01:09:56 It's American, I think.
01:09:57 Yeah, yeah.
01:09:58 Baltimore.
01:09:59 Okay.
01:10:00 So the fourth of October 2019 is the eighth month.
01:10:05 That don't line up.
01:10:06 Wait.
01:10:07 That was when we did the meetup at Digi's Place, right?
01:10:11 No?
01:10:12 Am I wrong?
01:10:13 No, no.
01:10:14 This is August 2019.
01:10:15 This is BronyCon.
01:10:16 This is BronyCon.
01:10:17 This must be BronyCon.
01:10:18 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:10:19 When are we going to Chipotle BronyCon?
01:10:20 At 4.30 p.m.
01:10:21 Maybe he went without you, Munchie.
01:10:22 No, we definitely did.
01:10:23 Some people do things without you.
01:10:24 I remember.
01:10:25 I remember.
01:10:26 No, I remember we went out to BronyCon.
01:10:27 I remember being there with, uh, uh, Cassie was there and I remember we were with the
01:10:31 little bird.
01:10:32 Wait.
01:10:33 I remember Banana was there.
01:10:34 Was I there?
01:10:35 Oh my God.
01:10:36 It's not that deep.
01:10:37 He went to Chipotle Munchie.
01:10:38 There's no analysis required.
01:10:39 No, no, without me?
01:10:40 Without me?
01:10:41 I'm sure you were there.
01:10:42 I think it was a whole big group.
01:10:44 Yeah, we went with a whole big group.
01:10:46 Yeah.
01:10:47 Like, we sat on the table.
01:10:49 This is radically an act that we're really tall.
01:10:51 What were you doing at the time?
01:10:52 I was doing partwheels.
01:10:53 I don't remember what.
01:10:54 Oh, was I printing out Slime Corp stuff?
01:10:57 Yes, that's it.
01:10:58 I think that's it.
01:10:59 You were printing out Slime Corp, but you missed on to Chipotle.
01:11:02 No, no, no.
01:11:03 That was something else because I remember, I remember, we went to Chipotle on the last
01:11:05 day.
01:11:06 We went to Chipotle on the last day right after we closed the ceremonies and then we came
01:11:09 back when we got MAP and we got, we saw MAP and we saw Ice Cold Water Guy and he was
01:11:14 awesome.
01:11:15 Right before that.
01:11:16 I remember now.
01:11:17 It's all coming back to me.
01:11:18 Thank God we solved this.
01:11:19 It's what my cue marks are telling me.
01:11:21 Sounds reasonable.
01:11:22 You see?
01:11:23 You see how cool that is?
01:11:24 Like a stupid fucking receipt brought all those memories back.
01:11:29 That actually is pretty cool.
01:11:30 I suppose that's true.
01:11:31 It's fucking awesome.
01:11:32 It says on the back, if you'd like a chance at free Chipotle, you should take our survey.
01:11:38 Nuff said.
01:11:39 Okay.
01:11:40 Nuff said.
01:11:41 You've said enough already.
01:11:43 No need for more.
01:11:44 I can't answer the survey actually.
01:11:47 But I want free.
01:11:48 So anyway guys, about an anime that I saw recently.
01:11:51 No, no, no, no, no.
01:11:53 This is a shitty anime.
01:11:54 All right.
01:11:55 Transition, transition to, let's talk about what a nightmare experience it was just yesterday
01:12:03 and the day before and whatever.
01:12:04 Just grinding out these bureaucratic details about Radcon stuff that's now like done.
01:12:09 I just wanted to spend a few minutes perhaps to just be like, holy shit.
01:12:14 That was like one of the most grueling meetings I've had in my fucking life and it was so
01:12:20 long and it, sure, it was profitable.
01:12:23 It was fruitful in the end, but it was a true nightmare and I had a headache and my body
01:12:29 was in shitty condition and I didn't get to go to the gym and also tensions got raised
01:12:34 and people were mean and it hurt my feelings.
01:12:37 What?
01:12:38 No one was mean.
01:12:39 What the fuck is this shit about?
01:12:41 I may have sounded silly, but I was really low on sleep and cranky and like not holding
01:12:47 back in any, like, I was just sort of like the whole time.
01:12:51 All right.
01:12:52 All right.
01:12:53 Now I'm going to get mean, Nate.
01:12:54 I'm going to fucking push you down.
01:12:55 I'm going to pick you up and I'm going to put you down.
01:12:57 Sure.
01:12:58 That was it.
01:12:59 That was the extent of what I was going to do.
01:13:00 Oh, that was it.
01:13:01 Okay.
01:13:02 All right.
01:13:03 Well, fair enough.
01:13:04 No, nothing to get into too much.
01:13:05 Okay.
01:13:06 But let me quickly take a time to shit talk perhaps the worst actor in this whole endeavor,
01:13:10 which is as you, it's did you, bro.
01:13:12 I mean, this motherfucker, right?
01:13:14 We're working for hours on this.
01:13:16 He fucking strolls into the chat.
01:13:18 He's like, ah, just figured out guys and we're like, uh, okay.
01:13:21 And here we go.
01:13:22 Spaying our entire fucking several days working on it.
01:13:25 And he just comes in and this fucking comment in the chat was, yeah, I'm calling you out.
01:13:28 Did you piece of fucking shit?
01:13:30 He was like, wow, you guys are really still meeting after six hours?
01:13:35 Oh, what the fuck guys?
01:13:40 Which by the way, translation that that call it was just, wow, I can't believe you guys
01:13:43 are means to after six hours.
01:13:45 How that's like not even that different than my emphasis.
01:13:48 That's like basically the same meaning.
01:13:49 I just put a silly voice on it.
01:13:51 True.
01:13:52 It's just so fucking disrespectful of the effort we're putting in.
01:13:56 These things matter.
01:13:57 They were important things being discussed.
01:13:59 Okay.
01:14:00 Okay.
01:14:01 What a fucking asshole.
01:14:02 Jesus Christ.
01:14:03 Am I wrong?
01:14:04 Am I fucking wrong?
01:14:05 And he thinks that we could just do it wherever.
01:14:07 Probably.
01:14:08 Okay.
01:14:09 Not literally wherever, but I'm sure he just trusts us.
01:14:10 Well, I think he thinks it's probably less effort than it is.
01:14:13 And I think that he thinks that, you know, whatever we come up with, we'll be fine for
01:14:16 him.
01:14:17 I think someone has to come up with those things.
01:14:19 No, no, the perception of what I think, you know, Digi, if you're listening to this,
01:14:23 I hope I'm not putting words into your mouth, but the perception I think is happening here.
01:14:26 It's like we are arguing over our ideal houses, not like coming up with houses to then decide
01:14:34 upon.
01:14:35 It's like we are all are coming at this and like he doesn't have to have a stake in
01:14:37 which house specifically we go to.
01:14:39 So anything is fine with him.
01:14:40 Only he actually did have huge preferences for some of the houses over others.
01:14:44 So actually he did have some pretty strong feelings about which ones.
01:14:48 So it's not like that's really totally true.
01:14:51 Oh, well.
01:14:53 Is Digi brah?
01:14:54 Yeah.
01:14:55 It's fine.
01:14:56 It's fine.
01:14:57 Don't worry about it.
01:14:58 Okay.
01:14:59 All right.
01:15:00 So Digi cares about all the details less than most of us and he's just by disposition.
01:15:07 It's true.
01:15:08 He's less detailed concerned than somebody like me at least.
01:15:11 It's like I get it.
01:15:12 I get it.
01:15:14 But just shut up and let us do it.
01:15:17 But just to specifically laugh at how fucking long we've been working.
01:15:22 Technically laugh in the comment he wrote.
01:15:24 Like you read that into it, I think.
01:15:27 You were like going insane over this like two like a message long paragraph that he
01:15:32 wrote.
01:15:33 It was like a one message long.
01:15:34 It was like one sentence.
01:15:35 It was one sentence.
01:15:36 He was like, haha.
01:15:37 Wow.
01:15:38 Oh, okay.
01:15:39 Exact quote.
01:15:40 Exact quote.
01:15:41 Digi.
01:15:42 Yeah.
01:15:43 Damn.
01:15:44 Have y'all been mean for six hours?
01:15:46 Indeed.
01:15:47 Indeed.
01:15:48 But I mean, this is one day out of several days.
01:15:51 He's just, he's just, you know, surprised, you know, this usually doesn't happen.
01:15:55 And so he's surprised and he's, you know, he's just voicing that, you know, there's
01:16:00 no direction.
01:16:01 Okay.
01:16:02 Here's the difference.
01:16:03 Here's the difference.
01:16:04 If I was getting paid more than Digi for this work, I wouldn't care.
01:16:11 But I'm not because we're already likely to barely break even.
01:16:16 So I just won't.
01:16:18 So why exactly is this like, why am I doing any of this?
01:16:22 What benefit do I have by putting in more effort than people who aren't literally nothing?
01:16:26 Oh, great.
01:16:27 That seems like a good use of my time.
01:16:29 See what I'm saying?
01:16:31 Yes.
01:16:32 Okay.
01:16:33 Okay.
01:16:34 But, you know, world peace, you know, love among brothers, kumbaya, yoga, you know, meditate.
01:16:46 Let's just say, let's just say where we all meet up to Red Con.
01:16:49 Where's your yoga skills now?
01:16:50 You're losing your composure.
01:16:52 Control your anger, Nate.
01:16:53 Control your anger.
01:16:54 I feel this is a healthy challenge.
01:16:55 Do a yoga.
01:16:56 Do a yoga.
01:16:57 Downward dog.
01:16:58 Let's just say that when we finally meet, we'll be six, but we will leave as five.
01:17:03 Oh, no.
01:17:05 That's true.
01:17:06 I need to get more choice Digi images, because the one from Red Con 3 where he's down the
01:17:09 Isle of Toys R Us and he's looking at me menacingly, that is literally the best thing to come out
01:17:14 of an entirety of Red Con 3.
01:17:15 So we have to get more shit like that.
01:17:16 That is a good one.
01:17:17 No doubt about it.
01:17:18 No doubt about it.
01:17:20 We should do that thing where we build like a Digi Sandman instead of a snowman and kill
01:17:25 him as well.
01:17:26 That's giving him too much respect to even give him that.
01:17:29 I mean, why?
01:17:30 Because he's more important?
01:17:31 No.
01:17:32 Fuck that.
01:17:33 Fuck that guy.
01:17:34 You are.
01:17:35 This bridge is burned.
01:17:36 Fuck that guy.
01:17:37 It's all coming out.
01:17:38 It's all coming out.
01:17:39 I hate this guy.
01:17:40 He's a real piece of shit, you know, just fuck him, man, just fuck.
01:17:46 If he just hadn't made that one comment, I wouldn't care, but he did.
01:17:50 He didn't respond to it in any way.
01:17:52 You didn't let him know that you were not going to do it until now.
01:17:53 Yeah, I mean, what am I going to put a fucking paragraph after paragraph about how fucking
01:17:57 insensitive and cruel that comment was?
01:18:00 I think that's how you do it.
01:18:01 Well, you did it, but you did it verbally right now.
01:18:03 Which is way easier than typing it out, so there you go.
01:18:07 Listen, dental plan, Lisa needs braces, damn, have y'all been mean for six hours just swirling
01:18:12 around in your head just over and over, you're stewing in and out.
01:18:14 Pretty much.
01:18:15 Yeah.
01:18:16 Yeah, pretty much.
01:18:17 Damn.
01:18:18 Damn.
01:18:19 Okay, listen, this is going to be the greatest good of all time.
01:18:23 But we got a lot accomplished.
01:18:24 We got, in spite of Digi's meddling, in spite of him putting up roadblock after roadblock,
01:18:30 we accomplished everything.
01:18:31 No, man, that's giving you too much credit.
01:18:32 It was pure indifference.
01:18:34 This is the most fucking totem on our heads thing that's ever been fucking like, like
01:18:39 Digi's is like a nefarious mastermind trying to thwart Radcon at every, not like, you
01:18:44 know, being uninformed, like, active guy.
01:18:46 He hates us, Monty.
01:18:47 He hates us, Monty.
01:18:48 He feeds on the chaos and the discord that he ensues in our hearts.
01:18:52 He feeds upon it.
01:18:53 It's his only means of substance.
01:18:54 I mean, the premise behind this whole thing is that like, if you're not present for discussions,
01:18:58 you basically have no say.
01:19:00 So you know, you have no say in what your reputation will be going forward either.
01:19:04 That's right.
01:19:05 After day one.
01:19:06 It's your own fault if we conspire against you.
01:19:08 That's right.
01:19:09 Exactly.
01:19:10 I want every single person, every single comment after day one of Radcon to be, damn, have
01:19:13 y'all been meeting for 24 hours and then so on and so forth.
01:19:17 Damn, have y'all been meeting for 10 days?
01:19:19 Dude, Radcon 4 means to come in early.
01:19:22 Oh yeah, I guess so.
01:19:23 That's true.
01:19:24 It's an early slime or not.
01:19:25 You're present for everyone.
01:19:26 I'm sure you guys know, and people can certainly weaponize this against me, but like, the thing
01:19:30 that makes me the most angry in this world, I definitely mentioned it to degrees before,
01:19:34 is like, not like an insult that like, hey, your stuff's shit, but like, like a disrespect
01:19:40 for the effort being put into something as if it's like it was pointless or didn't matter.
01:19:45 Shows like that are the most angering to me because it just, it shows like no care for
01:19:53 the effort being put into something, you know, it's just the most angering thing someone
01:20:00 can say.
01:20:01 Mm-hmm.
01:20:02 For me personally.
01:20:03 Yeah.
01:20:04 There you go.
01:20:05 Understandable.
01:20:06 I will say like I was saying at the beginning, the Radcon Fiora bureaucracy has been mind-numbing
01:20:10 and terrible and like the actual act of like, you know, searching for things.
01:20:13 So it was profitable, I think, and productive, and it's now like done basically.
01:20:17 We got it.
01:20:18 It is.
01:20:19 And you know what, it was fraternizing, which is good and cool.
01:20:23 I think I can use the word fraternizing in this way.
01:20:25 Well, that means to collaborate or something, right?
01:20:28 Yeah.
01:20:29 I don't know.
01:20:30 Yeah.
01:20:31 It was community building, but for like friends.
01:20:32 I think that's called like a conversation, I don't know, I don't think I've ever heard
01:20:36 of it.
01:20:37 I feel like we've gone through a trial by fire.
01:20:39 Yeah.
01:20:41 We all suffered through a common misery and we're all closer to the experience.
01:20:50 Dude, it's just like the West and Nazis, bro.
01:20:52 It's just like World War II.
01:20:54 It's just like band of fucking gather, dude.
01:20:56 It is like the Band of Brothers.
01:20:58 But like it's like we're the veterans who already fought like the first salvo of the
01:21:02 people and then like the new recruits were like, I can't wait, you guys are having so
01:21:06 much fun at war here, can't wait to join.
01:21:08 And we're like this motherfucking piece.
01:21:10 We are, we are like proud war veterans in the Vietnam War, right?
01:21:15 We've been out there doing good work, burning down villages, napalming preschools and stuff.
01:21:20 And then we get back here and Digi's here with his fucking hippie protest like, uh,
01:21:24 you know, child killer and I'm like, come on, freedom isn't free, fucker.
01:21:29 We are like the admirable Viet Cong going through the jungles, building tunnels underground
01:21:34 and Digi's just trying to blow up our rainforest and do guerrilla warfare tactics against us
01:21:38 every single step of the fucking way.
01:21:39 We're out here setting the Amazon rainforest on fire.
01:21:42 Okay.
01:21:43 This was kind of weird.
01:21:44 I saw an article.
01:21:45 Fucking up our atmosphere.
01:21:46 The great Australia brush fire.
01:21:48 There's like a weird like image, like a CCTV footage of like this like homeless looking
01:21:52 guy with like a joint like walking away and like he threw down the joint on the ground
01:21:55 and it started like a big fire.
01:21:56 That's really like strange.
01:21:57 It's really kind of weird actually.
01:22:00 Also Pam's was playing in the background.
01:22:03 I guess to be fair, the redeeming thing is that at important moments when we needed
01:22:08 Digi's input, he did eventually respond.
01:22:11 It was much harder to reach them than other people, but you know, fucking bad or epic
01:22:15 wall fucking epic.
01:22:17 Yeah.
01:22:18 Yeah.
01:22:19 That's why he did join for some jobs where he was needed.
01:22:21 So it wasn't all bad.
01:22:23 Listen, right.
01:22:24 Okay.
01:22:25 Okay.
01:22:26 Okay.
01:22:27 All right.
01:22:28 Here's what, here's what you need to understand guys and cut this out.
01:22:29 Eleazar.
01:22:30 If this is like too much, if this is too real, listen, we're already in the ship, we've spent
01:22:33 hours of our lives, you know, conducting a research, trying, oh my God, the search for
01:22:39 the house of this fucking place was an actual fucking number that went on long into the
01:22:43 night.
01:22:44 That was literally a travesty.
01:22:45 That was a holocaust too, if ever I fucking seen one.
01:22:48 And even on top of that, just all the hours to put it into trying to figure out things,
01:22:51 all the hours I spent making the logo for this, this has been a long endeavor and we
01:22:54 already have the Airbnb.
01:22:56 We already bought for it.
01:22:57 We bought all of our plane tickets.
01:22:59 We're fucking in the ship.
01:23:00 Cut that out.
01:23:01 Don't let them know.
01:23:02 Don't let them know.
01:23:03 Cut out the entire point then.
01:23:04 I don't want them to know we have financial vulnerability.
01:23:06 Isn't that good though?
01:23:08 Isn't that good?
01:23:09 No, we should tell them, yeah, we've already invested in it, like we've already put the
01:23:16 money where our mouth is and now it's up to them to make sure we don't regret it.
01:23:22 That's the idea, but I was going to be like, now you fucking better donate, bro, at the
01:23:25 wall.
01:23:26 No, don't argue for a position of weakness.
01:23:28 That's gay.
01:23:29 Is that weakness?
01:23:30 I'm just saying that I think it's good.
01:23:33 I think it shows that we are dedicated, that we went right ahead with it.
01:23:37 We got the house.
01:23:39 We already bought all our plane tickets and stuff.
01:23:41 We did.
01:23:42 That is true.
01:23:43 I think it makes us seem like chads where it's like, listen, we don't even fucking care,
01:23:46 bro.
01:23:47 We're out here.
01:23:48 If you want to be out here, then you can be, but if you're too fucking pussy and gay,
01:23:51 then you won't, but we're fucking out here, dog.
01:23:53 We're here.
01:23:54 We're at the level.
01:23:56 We went right at it.
01:23:57 We paid for it all out of our own pocket and now it's just the Kickstarter now is what's
01:24:02 going to make us not have lost all our money.
01:24:07 Yeah.
01:24:08 Fair enough.
01:24:09 Fair enough.
01:24:10 Keep it in L.A.S.R.
01:24:11 Flip a coin.
01:24:12 What were you saying, Munchie?
01:24:13 You were making a point there of some kind.
01:24:14 No, the point was that.
01:24:15 So.
01:24:16 Oh, okay.
01:24:17 Okay.
01:24:18 I see.
01:24:19 Well, audience, if you've heard this, then you've experienced a very special.
01:24:23 The reason we did that was because plane tickets get more expensive.
01:24:27 We would have paid double for the plane tickets probably if we'd waited until the Kickstarter
01:24:34 succeeded to buy our tickets.
01:24:36 So.
01:24:37 Yep.
01:24:38 That's true.
01:24:39 We're doing our best over here.
01:24:41 Hmm.
01:24:42 Well, I guess it'll be what it may be.
01:24:44 The Kickstarter will be ready today.
01:24:45 Who knows?
01:24:46 I don't know.
01:24:47 I don't know.
01:24:48 Probably not.
01:24:49 But in the next few days, it should be out.
01:24:50 Maybe.
01:24:51 I mean.
01:24:52 Well, I don't know how much is left to go.
01:24:53 Gotta make a video.
01:24:54 Gotta blah, blah, blah.
01:24:55 Oh, yeah.
01:24:56 Somebody's got to make an announcement video.
01:24:57 That's probably like the biggest thing.
01:24:59 Yeah.
01:25:00 That is the biggest thing.
01:25:01 And then maybe a couple little details.
01:25:02 But I guess we'll see.
01:25:04 So look for that.
01:25:05 But I guess that's it.
01:25:07 That's all I wanted to say about that.
01:25:09 More details will be on the Kickstarter when it comes out.
01:25:11 So keep your eyes peeled.
01:25:12 I guess that's it.
01:25:15 Tretch Gold, we get on the flight logs.
01:25:17 We ascend reality and we get to be on the mythical flight logs.
01:25:22 We need to be etched into history in the most admirable way possible.
01:25:26 By being on planes and being on the...
01:25:29 No, no, no.
01:25:30 Not just any flight logs, the flight logs name.
01:25:33 What are the flight logs?
01:25:34 I don't know what you mean.
01:25:35 The Jeffrey Epstein jet flight logs, of course.
01:25:38 What else could I need?
01:25:39 The Lilite Express flight logs.
01:25:40 Yeah.
01:25:41 I think.
01:25:42 Okay.
01:25:43 Okay.
01:25:44 Now I get it.
01:25:45 We go instead to Epstein Islands to have our confines.
01:25:46 Yeah.
01:25:47 What are you doing?
01:25:48 That would be epic.
01:25:49 Redcon 5 Epstein Islands.
01:25:50 Yes.
01:25:51 We have to.
01:25:52 We have to kill ourselves.
01:25:54 It's just like a hero.
01:25:56 It's like a hero Epstein.
01:25:58 I can't wait to kill myself.
01:26:01 Has anybody got a bed sheet handy?
01:26:06 Anybody got some gravity handy?
01:26:08 I don't actually know that.
01:26:10 We're done.
01:26:11 Let's do voicemails.
01:26:12 Let's go to voicemails now.
01:26:13 Okay.
01:26:14 That sounds good.
01:26:15 How many do we...
01:26:16 Oh wait.
01:26:17 Oh wait.
01:26:18 So okay.
01:26:19 Fucking issue with rhythm.
01:26:20 We all got to play them ourselves, but we can do it.
01:26:24 Leave them.
01:26:25 Leave your voicemails at the speak pipe link down below.
01:26:27 It's still working.
01:26:28 I didn't change anything.
01:26:29 Still going just fine.
01:26:30 I forgot about the worst part of this fucking show.
01:26:32 Okay.
01:26:33 All right.
01:26:34 Let's go.
01:26:35 Let's go.
01:26:36 We have eight of them.
01:26:37 Do you guys have them up?
01:26:38 You have them up?
01:26:39 Shit.
01:26:40 Let me...
01:26:41 I got to set it so it's coming out of my headphones.
01:26:42 God.
01:26:43 Oh my fucking god.
01:26:44 Hardware and sound.
01:26:45 Jesus.
01:26:46 Can we talk about the real worst member of the PCP?
01:26:51 Ben Saints?
01:26:52 Yeah.
01:26:53 I mean I have the exact same problem and I've tried to fix it for weeks.
01:26:56 It doesn't fix.
01:26:58 So it will just come out of my speakers and get picked up by my mic.
01:27:01 So I'll just mute myself while I listen, I guess.
01:27:03 Okay.
01:27:04 That works.
01:27:05 I have fixed the issue.
01:27:06 I am ready to go.
01:27:07 Okay.
01:27:08 We got...
01:27:09 First one is live from the Cuck Shed.
01:27:10 Sounds like a winner.
01:27:11 Okay.
01:27:12 So on the count of three, everybody play it.
01:27:13 Okay.
01:27:14 Here we go.
01:27:15 Three.
01:27:16 So, did anyone in the PCP see little women?
01:27:20 It's okay because you're all men and that you're afraid to watch it.
01:27:23 You got this.
01:27:24 I believe in your fam.
01:27:26 Support women now.
01:27:27 Before it's too late.
01:27:28 Wait, did we see little women?
01:27:29 Have you seen little women?
01:27:30 Have you seen little women?
01:27:31 No.
01:27:32 Every day I see them.
01:27:33 They are diminutive.
01:27:34 They're pretty small.
01:27:35 I mean, relatively.
01:27:36 I'd like to see more of them, frankly.
01:27:37 I'd say looking at my anime figurine collection now.
01:27:40 I can joke about really fast.
01:27:41 Wait, before the show, Ben was going to say something really cool.
01:27:43 Is there something like you met a girl?
01:27:45 You met a girl today, Ben?
01:27:46 Yeah.
01:27:47 Tell that story, please.
01:27:48 That's right.
01:27:49 This is good.
01:27:50 This is funny.
01:27:51 Well, okay.
01:27:52 The meme is that...
01:27:53 It was a miniature woman.
01:27:54 Yeah.
01:27:55 This was the meme on the last quick draw we recorded.
01:27:56 Before we started, I said in the call, hey, guys, I talked to you.
01:28:01 And everyone fucking crucified him and brutalized him.
01:28:08 And laid his corpse on the floor.
01:28:11 Oh, my God.
01:28:12 She had huge tits.
01:28:13 Her tits were so fucking big, by the way.
01:28:14 Wow.
01:28:15 Should I tell?
01:28:16 Should I tell what happened?
01:28:17 The legendary story?
01:28:18 You're already sitting on the quick draw.
01:28:19 It'll be on the quick draw, won't it?
01:28:20 No, I want to fucking hear it, goddamn it.
01:28:21 I haven't heard it.
01:28:22 I don't think you actually...
01:28:23 I don't think you actually told the story.
01:28:24 You started to tell it, and then we made fun of you.
01:28:25 I don't think I did.
01:28:26 Okay.
01:28:27 All right.
01:28:28 It sucks.
01:28:29 It's a bad story.
01:28:30 Good, good.
01:28:31 So strap in.
01:28:32 Well, I was at Garment District, you know, shopping for women's clothes, like I do.
01:28:35 And I don't know.
01:28:36 There was just a girl walking around, and she was really cute, and she had the biggest
01:28:41 tits imaginable.
01:28:42 Incredible.
01:28:43 Incredible.
01:28:44 Incredible.
01:28:45 Incredible.
01:28:46 Incredible.
01:28:47 Incredible.
01:28:48 Incredible.
01:28:49 Incredible.
01:28:50 Incredible.
01:28:51 Incredible.
01:28:52 Incredible.
01:28:53 Incredible.
01:28:54 Incredible.
01:28:55 Incredible.
01:28:56 Incredible.
01:28:57 Incredible.
01:28:58 Incredible.
01:28:59 Incredible.
01:29:00 Incredible.
01:29:01 Incredible.
01:29:02 Incredible.
01:29:03 Incredible.
01:29:04 Incredible.
01:29:05 Incredible.
01:29:06 Incredible.
01:29:07 Incredible.
01:29:08 Incredible.
01:29:09 Incredible.
01:29:10 Incredible.
01:29:11 Incredible.
01:29:12 Incredible.
01:29:13 Incredible.
01:29:14 Incredible.
01:29:15 Incredible.
01:29:16 Incredible.
01:29:17 Incredible.
01:29:18 Incredible.
01:29:19 I was just like, wow, you're gorgeous.
01:29:21 And she was like, is that bad?
01:29:24 No, it's fine.
01:29:25 Ignore the Zoomers.
01:29:26 They don't know how to talk to people.
01:29:27 Yeah, I just said, you're gorgeous.
01:29:29 And she was like, thanks.
01:29:31 I really appreciate it.
01:29:32 And I was like, OK, she doesn't want to be
01:29:35 spoken to by the male in public.
01:29:37 And that's her prerogative.
01:29:38 So I was just like, OK, cool.
01:29:42 That was it.
01:29:42 That's the whole story.
01:29:44 It's almost like the fucking worst method
01:29:46 in the entire world you could have done to get inside her pants
01:29:49 Give me a better method, Zoomer.
01:29:51 You have to work up to that.
01:29:52 You can't fucking just say, hey, you are a fuck right now.
01:29:54 You can't just say that.
01:29:55 OK.
01:29:56 People don't want to talk to you right now.
01:29:58 It was perhaps a slightly coming on a little strong.
01:30:01 But I mean, look, whatever.
01:30:02 It doesn't matter.
01:30:02 At least you talked to someone.
01:30:03 Give us time.
01:30:04 Munchie's talked to another human being ever.
01:30:06 Propose me an alternative strategy
01:30:08 that you would not be making fun of then.
01:30:10 Listen, I'm going to ask her about whatever specific thing
01:30:12 you say.
01:30:13 People will mock.
01:30:14 Whatever the specific thing is.
01:30:15 Like, that's not good enough because people
01:30:17 are so precious about their interaction with girls.
01:30:20 Hey, hey, oh, hi.
01:30:21 Oh, what you buying for?
01:30:23 You out shopping?
01:30:24 Nice weather we're having.
01:30:25 Then you didn't execute your one, two, three incremental nags.
01:30:27 You know, you didn't establish rapport first.
01:30:29 We could always.
01:30:30 Ben, you want to play this game?
01:30:31 OK, we can all just use silly voices to, hey,
01:30:35 you're looking beautiful today, babe.
01:30:38 That's probably more accurate to how it actually went.
01:30:42 To an outside observer.
01:30:43 Listen, I'm not being Ben Shapiro's sister, by the way.
01:30:47 I'm just imagining that the person that you're talking to.
01:30:49 Well, now you know the story.
01:30:51 And you can all go fuck yourselves.
01:30:55 You know what, what have you done today?
01:30:57 Nothing.
01:30:58 I, too, have talked to girls and embarrassed myself
01:31:01 in doing so many.
01:31:02 This wasn't even that embarrassing.
01:31:03 But I have done far worse.
01:31:05 And to anyone, have you ever told a girl
01:31:09 she was gorgeous?
01:31:09 In your fucking life, you cowards.
01:31:11 I just know there's people out there laughing
01:31:13 and I want them dead.
01:31:14 But OK, that's enough.
01:31:16 That's enough on that.
01:31:18 Like, I'm sorry.
01:31:18 I'm sorry.
01:31:19 If I say, never mind.
01:31:21 I don't have to justify myself.
01:31:23 It's fine to say it.
01:31:24 It's just like in a clothing store, it's a bit weird.
01:31:28 Like, it's just blanket a bit weird to start with.
01:31:31 Oh my god.
01:31:31 Anyone thinks it's weird that you're Ben?
01:31:33 I'm saying is you blew it.
01:31:34 You could have had it and you blew it.
01:31:35 That's the only concern.
01:31:36 OK, but you're right, Munchie.
01:31:38 I fucked up.
01:31:39 He took a shot, man.
01:31:41 I made a critical error.
01:31:43 You cringed, posted in real life,
01:31:45 wait you fucking hard and you blew it.
01:31:46 I mean, it's not like I expected it.
01:31:48 It's not like I was like, oh, if I say this,
01:31:50 she will fucking, she'll be all into it.
01:31:53 She'll be all over me if I say she's gorgeous.
01:31:56 It all comes down to episode three of Fooley Cooley.
01:31:59 I think that's episode three or episode four
01:32:01 about swinging the bat.
01:32:02 So many people just don't swing the bat at all.
01:32:04 That's episode four because I stopped in episode three
01:32:05 and I haven't been there yet.
01:32:07 OK, then maybe it's episode four.
01:32:08 But it's so much more honorable and respectable
01:32:10 to swing the bat even if you fail.
01:32:13 Thank you, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
01:32:16 There you go.
01:32:16 Exactly.
01:32:17 OK, all right.
01:32:17 And you know what?
01:32:17 And you know what?
01:32:18 OK, I'm going to justify myself even more.
01:32:20 You know what?
01:32:21 I could tell by her response that she
01:32:23 wasn't super comfortable with it.
01:32:26 And so I was like, OK, well, I'll leave you alone.
01:32:29 And I didn't say anything else to her.
01:32:31 Yes, that's well done.
01:32:31 And I think I did everything right.
01:32:34 So there you go.
01:32:35 There you go.
01:32:36 There you go.
01:32:37 You're gay.
01:32:38 I'm sickly.
01:32:38 Take a lesson.
01:32:39 Hey, hey, babe, do you dip french fries
01:32:42 and it melt chicks?
01:32:43 Do I have an ice cream flavor for you?
01:32:46 Next time you're a listener, next time
01:32:48 you're going to call into the PCP with some dumb question
01:32:51 and be like, oh, I saw this girl.
01:32:53 And I don't know how to tell her I like her.
01:32:56 Like, how do I ask a girl out?
01:32:57 Just like, just remember, just use the Ben St method.
01:32:59 And get rejected immediately.
01:33:01 And get the Ben St results.
01:33:02 That's right.
01:33:04 If you play the Ben St game, you get the Ben St earnings.
01:33:08 That's what you do.
01:33:09 But you know what I got, though?
01:33:11 You know what I got out of it?
01:33:12 What?
01:33:12 A story?
01:33:13 The moral victory.
01:33:14 Of course, of course.
01:33:16 All right, let's go to that deal still on top.
01:33:18 Don't pretend to like jazz unless you know who Ben St is.
01:33:25 All right, voicemail number two, it's from gayboyjo.
01:33:29 All right, you guys all good?
01:33:30 I am like, yes.
01:33:31 Good?
01:33:32 This is my boo.
01:33:33 On the count of three, click on it.
01:33:34 Here we go.
01:33:35 One, two, three.
01:33:37 I wish our man got a face of the facts.
01:33:39 I'm 25 and my voice still cracks.
01:33:41 I'm a little bitch ain't worth the shit my dick.
01:33:44 But I got my butt fucked a dude, even though he had AIDS
01:33:47 and a bad attitude, because even though I ain't gay,
01:33:50 there ain't no way I'd get in there late.
01:33:52 Even if I had the pegs, ugly as sin,
01:33:54 can even begin to pop the pimples in my face
01:33:56 like the night sky, constellations all over the place.
01:33:59 And I'm sick and tired of running in front of this damn rat race.
01:34:02 I can't keep pace.
01:34:04 That's all I got.
01:34:07 Poetry, poetry.
01:34:08 Pointless.
01:34:09 Thanks, thanks, Joe.
01:34:10 I like how he stumbled.
01:34:11 That was funny.
01:34:12 It was pointless.
01:34:13 We asked for poetry.
01:34:15 Self-deprecating humor is perennial.
01:34:18 We'll never go out of fashion.
01:34:20 Indeed.
01:34:20 Indeed.
01:34:21 By the way, somebody else.
01:34:22 It would have been funnier if he was badly
01:34:23 rapping about how good he can rap.
01:34:26 I suppose that's true.
01:34:27 That is correct.
01:34:29 Yeah.
01:34:29 By the way, there was another guy who left on that.
01:34:31 I think it was like PC poetry.
01:34:33 OK, that guy left one interesting poem
01:34:36 about the Wright brothers.
01:34:37 But it was over two voicemails.
01:34:40 And look, I got to tell you, if you
01:34:41 are expecting me to commit to playing two voicemails
01:34:45 for your voicemail, it's got to be something above and beyond.
01:34:48 And it was not up to quite that caliber, dude.
01:34:51 Pair it down.
01:34:52 Pair it down.
01:34:52 Just pair it down to one and submit it again.
01:34:55 Editorialize, remove some of that shit, send it again.
01:34:58 It was good.
01:34:58 But it was just too fucking long.
01:35:00 All right, let's go to the next one.
01:35:02 Here we go.
01:35:02 Tectonic improv, you guys good?
01:35:04 You ready to click?
01:35:05 Yes, this guy, who may I remind you,
01:35:08 this is the guy who did a PCPU style lecture on the canon
01:35:12 of Linkara and the Linkara universe.
01:35:15 Oh, right.
01:35:16 Fascinating.
01:35:16 If you want to check it out, he's got a YouTube channel.
01:35:20 It's called Tectonic Improv.
01:35:21 It's entertaining.
01:35:22 Well, shit.
01:35:23 All right.
01:35:23 He also does other stuff.
01:35:24 But let's see what he has to say today.
01:35:25 All right, start on the count of three.
01:35:27 Here we go.
01:35:28 One, two, three.
01:35:30 So Ben brought up that Matthew Matosis released
01:35:33 a new video in the last podcast.
01:35:36 Yeah, he got cut off.
01:35:37 I don't know if anyone had anything to say about that.
01:35:40 But I'd like to hear you guys' thoughts on it.
01:35:43 Personally, I was really psyched to watch the video.
01:35:45 And I got like 20 minutes in.
01:35:47 And then I realized that I kind of want
01:35:49 to play the game for myself.
01:35:51 And I feel like the commentary will be a lot more
01:35:55 enjoyable that way.
01:35:58 You guys ever really had that sort of thought
01:36:00 where you wanted to watch a video on a game or an anime
01:36:04 or something?
01:36:05 And maybe you got like a little while in.
01:36:07 And then we're like, you know what?
01:36:09 I want to watch the show before I get any further into this.
01:36:15 This is the saddest reflection of modern society
01:36:18 that I've literally ever seen in my entire fucking life.
01:36:21 The fact that this is a quaint idea.
01:36:23 Like, ooh, maybe I should like actually like watch the show
01:36:27 instead of just watching the video essay,
01:36:29 reviewing the show by my favorite internet personality.
01:36:32 Ooh, oh, that's such a weird, like a new kooky idea.
01:36:35 Oh, very strange.
01:36:37 I'm going to defend this other bizarrely idea.
01:36:40 I kind of don't care about spoilers, like almost ever.
01:36:45 I can't remember the last time I was like,
01:36:48 oh, a guy put out a video essay about a thing,
01:36:51 but I haven't seen the thing.
01:36:53 Oh, the biggest example.
01:36:54 I better go check it out before I watch the video.
01:36:57 I watched all of Twin Peaks before ever experiencing
01:36:59 any of the stuff they talked about.
01:37:00 And I absolutely love them.
01:37:01 But at this position, I had gone and watched all of Twin Peaks.
01:37:05 And like all of Silent Hill, blah, blah, blah.
01:37:07 And they just came out with their giant season three
01:37:09 of Twin Peaks like review or whatever.
01:37:11 And for this one, I was like, okay.
01:37:13 That's a while ago.
01:37:14 Yeah, at this point, it was months,
01:37:15 but I still haven't, I just have been doing other stuff.
01:37:17 I watched most, some of it, not all of it.
01:37:18 You haven't seen it yet.
01:37:19 I'm halfway through, give or take.
01:37:21 So like, no.
01:37:22 Wait, the review or through the show?
01:37:23 Through the show.
01:37:24 I put the review on hold to watch the show first.
01:37:27 Even though that's different from how I consumed
01:37:29 all the other material, but since I was so close
01:37:31 and I just had to watch one thing.
01:37:32 But like, you'd seen the old Twin Peaks.
01:37:34 So you were like largely, you were in it already.
01:37:37 Exactly, which is why I felt comfortable doing this.
01:37:40 But I just put it off cause like, you know,
01:37:43 I wanna fucking experience it for, they say,
01:37:46 like it's the spoiler warning of a lifetime right now.
01:37:49 At the very beginning, I'm like, well, okay.
01:37:50 I guess I'll, you know, I'd seen the old,
01:37:52 I'd seen the old Twin Peaks.
01:37:54 I wasn't that interested in watching the new one.
01:37:56 So even though I thought about it,
01:37:57 I decided to just go ahead and watch the video anyway.
01:38:00 And I don't regret it personally.
01:38:02 Well, that's fine.
01:38:03 Even if I did later on decide to watch the new Twin Peaks,
01:38:06 I don't think it would like hugely denigrate
01:38:09 my enjoyment of it.
01:38:10 You're probably right.
01:38:11 It might even improve it, I don't know.
01:38:12 It's not about spoilers or not.
01:38:14 Don't you see what's happening here?
01:38:15 You're all lying to yourselves.
01:38:16 Cause so, so, so often it's not like,
01:38:19 oh, you know, I'm in taking this information
01:38:22 and I will watch the show eventually,
01:38:23 but I'm just getting spoiled for it now.
01:38:25 I don't care about that.
01:38:26 That was a completely separate issue.
01:38:27 So, so often, 99% of the fucking time,
01:38:30 it's not you are just watching the video essay
01:38:33 or, you know, the review of it
01:38:34 and you never get around to the actual thing.
01:38:37 Cause you've just in taken all the information from it.
01:38:39 And you know, that's completely different
01:38:40 from actually watching the show,
01:38:41 but you've satisfied your bloodlust
01:38:43 and, you know, a hunger for content.
01:38:46 So that you're not actually going to get around to it.
01:38:48 This is the exact opposite of what should be happening.
01:38:49 You should be actually watching shows
01:38:51 instead of just watching regurgitation.
01:38:52 That's exactly what I described.
01:38:54 I don't know how many shows I actually want to watch though.
01:38:58 Well, that's a problem.
01:38:59 There's only like two shows per year
01:39:01 that are worth anything.
01:39:02 There's good old ones.
01:39:03 Currently, yeah, there's tons of old ones.
01:39:06 Like, you could, I could easily do someone
01:39:08 making like a great review.
01:39:09 Maybe I'll do this one day.
01:39:10 I mean, like to watch.
01:39:11 I watch two things per year.
01:39:13 Okay, sure.
01:39:13 Yeah, and that's a problem.
01:39:14 And I'm maybe one day I'll do a big video
01:39:16 on like The Sopranos, a show I love
01:39:18 and watch the entire thing.
01:39:19 It's like seven seasons, but it does rule.
01:39:21 But like anyone who I'm like,
01:39:23 hey, go watch it first.
01:39:24 We're talking like seven seasons or whatever
01:39:26 of a fucking show.
01:39:27 So that's a big commitment.
01:39:29 I have a lot of like,
01:39:31 oh, it would be nice if I could get around
01:39:33 to watching Star Trek The Next Generation or something.
01:39:35 Yeah, yeah.
01:39:36 I have lots of like a list, like mind maps of those things.
01:39:41 But like, I feel like in the free time I have
01:39:46 getting that all set up annoys me.
01:39:50 And even if it's easy, I don't like binge watching things.
01:39:55 And so, I don't know.
01:39:57 You don't have to binge watch Star Trek.
01:39:58 It's a different mindset to sit down
01:40:00 and watch some episode of a thing
01:40:04 than it is to like passively intake a YouTube video
01:40:09 while you're doing something else.
01:40:10 Yeah, and it's a massively worse experience.
01:40:12 You can get way less out of it.
01:40:13 You can passively consume.
01:40:13 I will strongly advocate Star Trek is a show.
01:40:16 Most of it I watched, tabbed out,
01:40:19 just listening to people talk, doing other work.
01:40:21 It's absolutely a show you can do that.
01:40:23 But I'm just making my little pitch
01:40:24 because I love Star Trek and I want everyone to watch it.
01:40:26 Neither here nor there.
01:40:28 In any case, the point is fair.
01:40:30 I would like to be in the mindset
01:40:34 where I want to consume thing.
01:40:37 But like, I very rarely get excited for anything.
01:40:39 It's just, it's not even like YouTube.
01:40:42 This has been like all of my life.
01:40:44 Like, I just don't care about stuff.
01:40:47 I have a very, very small pool of things
01:40:49 I'm extremely passionate about.
01:40:52 You're on the same page as me.
01:40:53 I'm just, I just don't care.
01:40:55 I just don't care that much about, oh, a show is out?
01:40:59 How good could it possibly be?
01:41:01 Well, look at the classics though.
01:41:02 I mean, I would find, I'm certainly in what's become a classic.
01:41:05 I mean, it's not even like,
01:41:07 it's not even about like, oh, current things.
01:41:09 It's all, it's all media.
01:41:10 Like I intake not that much media
01:41:14 and I'm pretty happy with the amount of, you know,
01:41:16 that I don't watch, like cause.
01:41:19 Fair enough.
01:41:20 I don't know.
01:41:21 Like it sort of gets overwhelming
01:41:23 if I'm trying to watch one show,
01:41:25 like one episode per week.
01:41:28 Even if it's an old one.
01:41:29 It's just sort of like, ah, who cares?
01:41:32 I think without strong influences in your art
01:41:35 and being an artist and not seeking out other artists' work,
01:41:38 I think is a major detriment to your evolution
01:41:41 as a person, as a human being and as an artist.
01:41:44 I think it's a big problem.
01:41:45 You're probably right.
01:41:46 But just like such a small percentage of the things
01:41:49 that I do consume end up being like meaningful to me.
01:41:53 Sure, but that's what you gotta do.
01:41:54 It's discouraging.
01:41:55 It's discouraging.
01:41:56 There's a sense, all right, there's that, all right.
01:41:58 But there's also like life experiences.
01:42:01 I'm not saying like YouTube is life experiences.
01:42:03 YouTube is definitely bad and I agree with you on that.
01:42:07 But like when it comes to meaningful experiences,
01:42:12 I know what I like and I seem to like the same things
01:42:14 every time and so like going for a walk is like something,
01:42:19 you know, I mean, I went for a walk today.
01:42:21 I walked the dog and it was cold, but the sun came out
01:42:25 and you know, the sun was like glistening on the lake
01:42:29 and across the grass and it was like incredible.
01:42:32 Like I would much rather had gone on that walk
01:42:34 than watch a few episodes of a show
01:42:37 I've been meaning to get around to.
01:42:41 Okay, fair enough.
01:42:42 Hey, what can you say?
01:42:42 I get you, I mean, I understand that.
01:42:45 But I think that, okay, I think that novelties of virtue,
01:42:47 I think originalities of virtue,
01:42:49 I think that experiencing new things
01:42:50 is almost inherently good.
01:42:52 And I think that people overestimate
01:42:55 how hard it is to get into things
01:42:57 even that are super long,
01:42:58 like let's say for Homestuck for example, for instance,
01:43:01 and this isn't a great example
01:43:03 because this is extremely short show,
01:43:04 but as we were just talking about it,
01:43:05 Fooly Coolie has been on my radar forever, forever.
01:43:10 And I've always wanted to watch it,
01:43:11 but I just haven't gone around to it
01:43:13 because I fucking hate watching things.
01:43:14 I'm on the same page of the sense that it's like,
01:43:16 I tried to watch like a couple of like episodic dramas
01:43:19 or like HBO dramas and it was so fucking hard
01:43:21 to slog through them all.
01:43:23 But once I get into a show and I just say, okay,
01:43:26 today I'm gonna watch like an episode, you know,
01:43:28 if I get the time.
01:43:29 I've just been putting on Fooly Coolie during lunch breaks
01:43:32 where I normally would put YouTube on
01:43:34 because I've blocked YouTube from my computer
01:43:36 literally indefinitely forever.
01:43:38 By the way, link in description to my Tumblr post 2020
01:43:41 where you can read all about why I'm doing what I'm doing.
01:43:43 But anyway, I've been watching Fooly Coolie
01:43:45 and it's not that hard.
01:43:46 Obviously it's only six episodes,
01:43:47 but like I can easily see doing this for a longer show.
01:43:50 It will take some time to realize,
01:43:53 but it'll be so much better for me in the long run
01:43:56 and feel so much better even in the moment
01:43:58 than doing the same sort of stuff
01:43:59 that I've done a thousand times before
01:44:00 and re-watching a Dude's Bro video
01:44:02 and doing all this shit that I could.
01:44:04 Well, that's your mistake.
01:44:06 Did you finish Fooly Coolie?
01:44:08 No, but I'm close.
01:44:10 Oh, it's so good.
01:44:12 When I first like started trying to watch anime in 2014,
01:44:17 I watched like Space Standing, Kill a Kill
01:44:19 because they were out and they were cool
01:44:20 and Ava and Gurren Lagann and Cowboy Bebop.
01:44:24 But then, and Fooly Coolie, I think,
01:44:27 but then there was like Gun Buster and Die Buster,
01:44:30 which was recommended to me by you two, Ben and Nate.
01:44:34 Yeah, yeah.
01:44:35 And I don't know what it was.
01:44:38 I think it was just sort of the wrong mindset.
01:44:40 This thing I'm talking about,
01:44:42 like the wrong mindset to enjoy or view something
01:44:45 because I've watched it to get it off the checklist
01:44:48 and I was like, yeah, yeah, well, yeah, cool, yeah, cool.
01:44:54 Sure.
01:44:55 And I was, my reaction was not,
01:44:58 like my reaction was not cool enough in the chat,
01:45:01 I remember, and you were like,
01:45:03 what the fuck, isn't it the coolest thing ever?
01:45:04 And I was like, I stand by.
01:45:07 Sure, sure.
01:45:07 Oh God, this just proves even more
01:45:10 that society is fucking crumbling before me,
01:45:13 that the West is falling.
01:45:14 This literally proves it.
01:45:14 We truly live in a fallen state.
01:45:16 It's literally, I understand why you have that.
01:45:20 It's not like you're a fault hippo.
01:45:21 That's just what these institutions in our life
01:45:24 has bred us to believe.
01:45:25 Because you wanna check out these,
01:45:27 check off these checks on the list
01:45:29 because you wanna be a part of the conversation
01:45:31 that people are having around us.
01:45:32 We wanna be a part of the YouTube sphere.
01:45:33 We wanna be able to consume all this stuff about it.
01:45:35 We wanna get into the fandom and show that.
01:45:36 But yeah, I mean, that's my whole argument
01:45:39 is that if I'm not in the right mindset
01:45:41 to take something in,
01:45:43 it's going to be at the expense of the thing.
01:45:45 And I kind of don't wanna do that.
01:45:49 Oh, watch a show when I feel like watching it.
01:45:51 And then it'll be way better.
01:45:53 I think we all understand this point now.
01:45:56 Let's go to the next goddamn voicemail.
01:45:59 Okay, I'm ready.
01:46:00 Okay, next one is The Puppet Master.
01:46:03 We all ready?
01:46:04 You guys good?
01:46:05 Yeah, yeah.
01:46:05 Okay, count of three.
01:46:06 Here we go.
01:46:07 One, two, three.
01:46:08 Does being autistic help you focus on your project, dude?
01:46:11 Does that help?
01:46:12 Shout out.
01:46:14 Oh, Nate, you wound me deeply.
01:46:18 Before I respond to that,
01:46:19 I just need to reiterate the most important part
01:46:21 of my last voicemail,
01:46:23 which was cut off by your autistic screaming.
01:46:26 And that is to profess my undying love and affection
01:46:29 for Hippo and everything that he does.
01:46:31 Although I did once leave a nasty comment
01:46:33 on one of his previous videos.
01:46:34 And I think you know which one it is.
01:46:38 Anyway, yeah, I know Digi is a complete and utter madman
01:46:42 and his whole autism spectrum thing is just a meme.
01:46:44 I threw it in there because I thought it might be funny.
01:46:47 And you know-
01:46:48 Tell us more of your life story, buddy.
01:46:49 I'm really serious.
01:46:50 Oh my god.
01:46:51 So I understand how you thought that I wasn't joking.
01:46:53 Oh my god.
01:46:54 Come on, give me some credit for that.
01:46:55 I'm not that fucking autistic.
01:46:57 That aside, I'm really glad you guys
01:46:59 liked the communist hell voicemails
01:47:00 and have to put me in the PCP voicemail.
01:47:02 And I would really like to do a finale
01:47:04 at some point this year.
01:47:05 If I can find the inspiration to conclude it.
01:47:08 It's a nice creative outlet to do fun stuff like this.
01:47:10 And thanks for the advice.
01:47:11 I'll try it out and see how it goes.
01:47:14 And also, Nate, I was not joking in the voicemail
01:47:18 from Comrade Stalin, October of last year.
01:47:20 From one software developer to another,
01:47:23 coding and coder are normie words.
01:47:26 To thick dick master race digital gods,
01:47:28 like us, it's called programming.
01:47:31 Anyways, thanks again, guys.
01:47:34 Xin yen kuala.
01:47:35 Voice, voice, voice, voice, voice, voice, voice, voice.
01:47:41 I mean, what a record.
01:47:43 This man has been previously in voice grail
01:47:45 until this point.
01:47:47 Jail, jail him, jail him.
01:47:49 Okay, before we make that decision.
01:47:52 There's something, okay, there's something going on here.
01:47:55 There is a brand of voicemail lever
01:47:59 who weirdly thinks that we need to know
01:48:03 so much of their personal backstory
01:48:05 with the voicemail, like guys, I left this voicemail,
01:48:09 this voicemail, this voicemail,
01:48:10 but you need to know that.
01:48:11 It's important.
01:48:12 Clearly shows that he is actually that autistic
01:48:15 with the amount of, like, he assumes so much
01:48:18 that we would remember all of these things that he's done.
01:48:20 I mean, I do remember them.
01:48:22 I understand the urge.
01:48:24 But specifically the comment that he assumes I know
01:48:28 that he left and will remember when he mentions it.
01:48:31 I don't know what he's talking about.
01:48:33 That you're gonna make a finale.
01:48:36 Just like, call in with the finale and we'll hear it.
01:48:43 This is so long, so meandering,
01:48:45 such a waste of fucking time.
01:48:47 Just pussy-footing, apologizing and clarifying
01:48:51 to these voicemails.
01:48:52 What a more pointless thing could possibly exist.
01:48:56 You are an autistic, more autistic, more autistic.
01:48:59 You're insane.
01:49:01 You are a psychopath.
01:49:02 You are a unabomber.
01:49:03 You are a fucking,
01:49:04 this is just pure constructive criticism,
01:49:08 no doubt about it, to help the puppet master
01:49:10 and those like him leave higher quality voicemails
01:49:13 in the future.
01:49:14 You're in the fucking voice jail.
01:49:15 This is literally the fucking worst day of my entire life.
01:49:17 I guess the people have spoken.
01:49:19 I guess he's going straight to voicemail.
01:49:20 We are personal inmates.
01:49:21 I am on a first name basis with you and your mom.
01:49:25 We're putting the voice puppeteer in the voice jail.
01:49:27 Okay.
01:49:29 Okay, let's go to the next one.
01:49:32 She pollution from the future.
01:49:34 Oh, this is the person who asked us like our thoughts
01:49:36 on what would be left in the future.
01:49:38 Reporting from the future, it seems.
01:49:40 Okay.
01:49:40 All right, you ready?
01:49:41 Ready to click?
01:49:42 Ready to click?
01:49:43 Okay, on the count of three, here we go.
01:49:44 One, two, three.
01:49:47 Hello?
01:49:48 Wow.
01:49:49 Can you guys hear me?
01:49:49 He's receiving you, yeah.
01:49:50 Hello?
01:49:51 Yes, okay, yes, hello.
01:49:52 It's me, she pollution from the future.
01:49:54 I was too curious about if your predictions were correct.
01:49:56 So I built a time machine.
01:49:58 So let's see.
01:49:59 Ben is still in Pito.
01:50:00 He also got his 26th kidney stone.
01:50:02 Hmm.
01:50:03 Oh, and Digipro is a father now.
01:50:05 You guys edit the page material for naming a skate
01:50:07 like you said you would.
01:50:08 And well, let's just say that you guys call him Nick
01:50:11 for short.
01:50:12 The PSP still exists and your channel is doing great.
01:50:16 You got lots of subscribers when a short clip of hippo
01:50:18 making a joke became viral.
01:50:20 Something with apple juice and dogs.
01:50:22 Also, it's in prison for animal abuse.
01:50:25 Okay, so there we go.
01:50:26 Took that my time machine can only go one year
01:50:28 into the future.
01:50:29 Hey.
01:50:30 Well, see you next year.
01:50:31 Bye.
01:50:32 What's at the end?
01:50:34 All right.
01:50:35 There you go.
01:50:35 One year.
01:50:36 Sorry, if you are not, if you don't have a proper American
01:50:40 accent, then you cannot put a voice modulator on.
01:50:42 You can't do it.
01:50:43 It's like the double way of me.
01:50:46 It can make things.
01:50:47 I mean, every word that was modulated,
01:50:49 I understood in that.
01:50:51 I heard my name, but I don't know what you said.
01:50:54 One of you is echoing, by the way.
01:50:56 It's not me.
01:50:57 It's a hypocrite, probably.
01:50:58 It is hypocrite.
01:51:00 When I'm listening to the things only,
01:51:02 it's an unfortunate setup.
01:51:03 I'll cut it out of my ear.
01:51:05 Okay, okay.
01:51:06 Well, hey, there's Sleet Sheepolution.
01:51:08 Thanks for the report.
01:51:09 In a year, we'll look at another year in the future.
01:51:11 Glad to know the future is bleak,
01:51:13 just like I expected.
01:51:15 Called it, hashtag called it.
01:51:18 All right, let's go to the next one.
01:51:19 Looking forward to it.
01:51:20 Okay, oh, here's an interesting one.
01:51:22 No more shit lectures.
01:51:24 Let's hear what he has to say.
01:51:26 All right, on the count of three, here we go.
01:51:28 One, two, three.
01:51:29 Okay, so what made the original PCP lectures good
01:51:34 is that we had each member's esoteric,
01:51:37 autistic perspective on this very weird subject
01:51:40 and how it related to them.
01:51:42 So we had Nate with his devotion to the Kingdom Hearts
01:51:46 and how he understood its weird nonsense plot
01:51:48 across all the games.
01:51:50 About Ben, how he explored Christian as a person
01:51:53 through Christian's work.
01:51:55 And then Munchy, like, loving performance art
01:51:58 through Park or Dude91.
01:52:00 And then the next year, for Adcon 3,
01:52:03 they all deliver utter fucking dog shit.
01:52:05 Nate just poorly remembers parts of the Final Fantasy games
01:52:08 and there's no connection there
01:52:10 and just it was boring and useless.
01:52:12 Ben just tells you the plot to a webcomic
01:52:15 that has Sonic to it.
01:52:16 So I guess, you know, that's the same,
01:52:19 even though there's literally nothing interesting
01:52:21 about what he says.
01:52:22 And then Munchy just watched a YouTube video once
01:52:25 and then repeats it back to the audience.
01:52:27 So congratulations, lad.
01:52:28 You really put in the effort.
01:52:29 You really did the groundwork there.
01:52:31 Don't fuck it up this year for Adcon 4.
01:52:34 Actually put the work in.
01:52:35 If you don't have a lecture to be interesting,
01:52:38 just don't fucking do one then.
01:52:40 Thank God Digi Tom could save Adcon 3.
01:52:44 So please, don't be shit.
01:52:49 Yeah, Digi's gonna save Adcon 4.
01:52:51 No doubt.
01:52:53 I kind of low key agree,
01:52:56 but I don't think-
01:52:57 A little bit.
01:52:58 But did you have to hurt my feelings on the way, sir?
01:53:00 That's my one question.
01:53:02 I think, okay, well, both the lectures
01:53:04 I'm planning on giving, I think are pretty solid.
01:53:07 So I don't think, I mean,
01:53:08 I don't think the Tails Gets Trolled Lecture is shit.
01:53:10 I don't think it's as good as the Sonichu one.
01:53:12 Yeah, yeah.
01:53:13 He's probably pointing to that drop off, I guess,
01:53:14 in some degree. It's good.
01:53:16 And I think I have some interesting points to make
01:53:20 about Jennifer Diane Wrights.
01:53:22 And I think that I have lots to say
01:53:25 about Chris Chan post 2000, whenever it was,
01:53:31 that the-
01:53:32 Right, right.
01:53:32 Whenever the last one ended.
01:53:34 I mean, it's gonna be good.
01:53:35 Fuck you.
01:53:36 Maybe I didn't explain it well enough
01:53:38 in the actual lecture,
01:53:39 but it's not like I had seen that video recently.
01:53:42 Like it had been like a driving force between,
01:53:44 like I had seen it as a kid
01:53:46 and had continuously come back to it over the years.
01:53:48 And it's something that I had ruminated on
01:53:50 various, many different times.
01:53:52 So the human history lecture didn't come out
01:53:53 like the ether like a couple of weeks beforehand.
01:53:55 It was, I mean, maybe I didn't come through the lecture
01:53:58 and therefore it made it worse because of it,
01:53:59 but like it was definitely not like random
01:54:02 or like I watched a YouTube video.
01:54:04 I watched a very important YouTube video
01:54:06 and then I reached out.
01:54:08 Hey, true, true.
01:54:10 Yeah, all right.
01:54:11 These are fair points.
01:54:13 Keep in mind.
01:54:13 All right, anyway, let's go to the next one.
01:54:15 We've got Mass Effect Mouth Noises.
01:54:18 Okay, let's do it.
01:54:20 On the count of three, here we go.
01:54:21 One, two, three.
01:54:23 All right, Mr. Bestman.
01:54:25 I have a complaint from last week's episode.
01:54:29 You claimed that Mass Effect 3 was a bad finale
01:54:34 when really only the very ending was a letdown
01:54:38 and the rest of the game and its multiplayer
01:54:41 were received pretty well.
01:54:45 What's your take on that?
01:54:47 I voiced jail, I hate this person.
01:54:49 I think, isn't Tom the only one of us
01:54:53 who's actually played Mass Effect?
01:54:54 I have not played Mass Effect.
01:54:56 I'm repeating, I played a, look, was I not clear?
01:55:00 Everything I know comes from
01:55:02 Mr. B. Tung's review videos.
01:55:04 Did you play Mass Effect, Jesse played Mass Effect?
01:55:08 That's true, none of them are here
01:55:10 who actually played the game.
01:55:10 Why does this person exist?
01:55:12 Why did he do this?
01:55:13 What did he hope to be?
01:55:14 Yeah, what a strange small complaint.
01:55:18 This is the, you know, I'm sure there were people out there.
01:55:21 These people always exist.
01:55:23 That like when a wave of criticism appears,
01:55:25 there's the people who are like, you know,
01:55:27 and you know, maybe they're literally correct.
01:55:29 They're like, sure guys,
01:55:29 your point about that one specific thing is fair,
01:55:31 but there's all this other good stuff.
01:55:33 Like I could believe that.
01:55:34 It's just, it seems like,
01:55:36 wasn't the entire promise from the beginning of Mass Effect
01:55:39 was a big story where things would,
01:55:42 your decisions would matter in the end and like,
01:55:44 okay, everything else, let's say, was great about the game.
01:55:47 But when that, you could, I think it's fair to say
01:55:50 the most important thing, at least relating to the story,
01:55:53 and it's a story-based fucking game,
01:55:55 turns out to, they actually didn't plan it out
01:55:58 and it made basically no difference.
01:56:00 I mean, at that point, it seems like fair to be like,
01:56:03 can you call it a failure?
01:56:04 I mean, everyone's got their definition, I guess, but.
01:56:06 I don't know, I don't feel comfortable speculating
01:56:09 having not played it.
01:56:11 I mean. Yeah, fair enough.
01:56:13 We shouldn't even talk about it.
01:56:15 We have nothing to say about it.
01:56:16 It's really stupid, it doesn't even fucking matter.
01:56:18 And this guy is stupid.
01:56:19 Fucking Mass Effect mouth noises.
01:56:21 Never call here again.
01:56:22 Yeah.
01:56:24 Voice jail, voice jail, huh?
01:56:25 Yeah, I don't feel that strongly about it.
01:56:27 I'm feeling pretty generous today.
01:56:28 Voice jail, I'm feeling pretty generous.
01:56:29 I'm feeling generous.
01:56:31 No, that's giving him too much credit.
01:56:33 I don't care, whatever, let's move on to the next one.
01:56:36 We can actually shout later.
01:56:38 All right, Zolpher is our last words.
01:56:40 We can have another six hour meeting about it.
01:56:41 Yeah, we'll have that, that'll be good, that'll be good.
01:56:43 All right, Zolpher is our final one for the day.
01:56:45 Let's see how he does.
01:56:47 Okay, one, two, three.
01:56:49 I did it, PCP.
01:56:50 I lost my virginity.
01:56:52 I completed my love quest by listening to your podcast.
01:56:55 Yeah. Thank you.
01:56:57 Here's how I did it.
01:56:59 Step one, I went to Animate Club.
01:57:02 Nice.
01:57:03 Step two, I approached a cute, quiet girl
01:57:05 that was just by herself.
01:57:06 You said you're gorgeous.
01:57:07 This car knocks me for the sake of this story
01:57:09 or just not see for short.
01:57:12 Step three, the most important step,
01:57:14 I didn't talk to her about Animate.
01:57:16 We talked about philosophy, poetry,
01:57:19 love, our dreams for the future.
01:57:21 She wants to be a pediatrician,
01:57:23 but she's failed to cause entrance exams seven times.
01:57:27 I asked her why she can't pass a test.
01:57:29 Biology, she says, I'm really bad at anatomy.
01:57:33 A bell rang in my head.
01:57:36 I knew exactly what to say.
01:57:38 I look into her eyes and I just say,
01:57:40 I'll teach you what I know.
01:57:44 Well done.
01:57:45 Wow, wow, okay.
01:57:47 Unbelievable.
01:57:48 Munchie, I think you think that that's a real story,
01:57:50 but it was clearly a joke story.
01:57:52 Yeah, that actually makes it really good now, actually.
01:57:55 That actually completely changed me.
01:57:58 In that case, I'm very entertained.
01:57:59 Yeah.
01:58:01 Guys, we have to have an intervention here.
01:58:04 What is happening right now?
01:58:05 Nate, why are you like this?
01:58:07 Why does this happen?
01:58:08 Hey, just consider these were the best of the bunch.
01:58:10 I mean, you know.
01:58:11 Just pick better ones.
01:58:13 There are no better ones.
01:58:14 You heard the best ones.
01:58:15 Then pick zero.
01:58:17 Yeah, none.
01:58:18 We could have.
01:58:19 We don't need to have more than one ship.
01:58:20 Guys, guys, guys.
01:58:21 Listen, your complaints are totally worthless
01:58:23 and I don't care.
01:58:25 You just do this unpaid job,
01:58:27 then you'll have nothing to complain about.
01:58:29 You do get paid.
01:58:30 No, not for this, no I don't.
01:58:32 You get the ad?
01:58:32 Okay, fine, fine.
01:58:34 We've been over this many times.
01:58:37 Okay, well, listen,
01:58:39 I'm gonna fucking slap you on the wrist
01:58:40 and say do better.
01:58:41 That's the only thing I have the authority to do.
01:58:43 That's, I suppose that's fair.
01:58:45 And I'm gonna fucking work it to the best of my ability.
01:58:48 All right, that's it.
01:58:49 We're done with this shit.
01:58:50 I'm ready to get the fuck out of here.
01:58:52 Please improve voicemails.
01:58:53 I'm sure you don't have to read Confor.
01:58:55 Wait, wait, wait.
01:58:55 We're not actually done.
01:58:56 Please shut up.
01:58:57 Assuming that it exists yet and nobody knows.
01:58:59 Speak, pipe, link, voicemails,
01:59:01 please leave ones that are improved.
01:59:03 Or don't honestly, don't leave a voicemail, please.
01:59:06 Please fucking joke.
01:59:07 Just leave the cream of the crop.
01:59:09 Do your thing, do your thing.
01:59:11 We don't need your whole life story.
01:59:13 We don't need your whole every, you know,
01:59:15 fucking voicemail you left in your whole fucking life.
01:59:17 What do you say at the beginning?
01:59:18 Just amuse us.
01:59:19 It's still nap time.
01:59:20 It's been nap time this whole time.
01:59:22 It's really a loud nap time.

02:00:32 Hey, I got a little bit of news.
02:00:34 I got a little bit of funny news this week,
02:00:36 just yesterday, or maybe the day before.
02:00:39 You should fuck off.
02:00:41 The Sonichu Lecture hit a million views.
02:00:43 Oh, that's right.
02:00:44 Pretty cool.
02:00:45 Congratulations.
02:00:46 Now nobody can watch it again.
02:00:47 It has to stay there.
02:00:48 I got that nice M under the thumbnail.
02:00:50 You got that nice W in life.
02:00:53 What?
02:00:54 It's a win, Ben.
02:00:55 It's a win.
02:00:55 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:00:56 This is what the Urban News say, yeah.
02:00:58 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:00:59 I know all about them.
02:01:00 They've adopted me.
02:01:01 All right, that's it.
02:01:02 That's what's up.
02:01:02 We're done, everybody.
02:01:03 Hey, patreon.com slash theprocrastinaires,
02:01:05 support the show.
02:01:06 $5, get the bonus episodes, $1, fucking Discord,
02:01:11 and hang out with us, blah, blah, blah,
02:01:12 but give us more money.
02:01:13 And also, PSB Minecraft, I'm sure it'll be back up
02:01:15 by the time you see this.
02:01:17 Hopefully, we'll see about that.
02:01:18 Oh, my God, is it not back up yet?
02:01:20 Oh, no.
02:01:21 We're currently waiting for shock bite to fix it.
02:01:24 It's the problem on their side.
02:01:25 We are convinced of this.
02:01:27 They got to fix some bullshit.
02:01:28 And hopefully they'll give us money,
02:01:29 but they won't because they're clearly cheap motherfuckers.
02:01:33 But we'll see what's up.
02:01:34 It's not our fault, but we'll have it fixed soon.
02:01:37 Play Minecraft.
02:01:38 It's a good time.
02:01:39 All right, we're done.
02:01:40 We're out of here.
02:01:41 We'll see you next week, everybody.
02:01:42 Rack on four.
02:01:43 Pay us money.
02:01:44 We could use it.
02:01:45 Thank you very much.
02:01:46 All right, we're out of here.
02:01:47 Later.
02:01:49 Bye.
02:01:50 Bye.
