00:00:00 I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:02 That son of a bitch.
00:00:03 Son of a bitch.
00:00:04 Son of a bitch.
00:00:05 Son of a bitch.
00:00:06 Son of a bitch.
00:00:07 Son of a bitch.
00:00:08 Son of a bitch.
00:00:09 Son of a bitch.
00:00:10 Bitch, bitch, bitch.
00:00:11 All right, then, welcome to a canceled episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:18 It is January 9th, 2022.
00:00:21 It's the new second episode of the new year.
00:00:25 Who do we have?
00:00:27 Cybershell is here.
00:00:28 I'm back for my mandated yearly appearance.
00:00:31 I'm only here because I know there's at least one guy in the PCV audience who probably
00:00:35 like fucking hates me and he's like, oh god, can't believe he's back, he's on another episode
00:00:39 to ruin it.
00:00:40 Yeah, I'm here just to ruin that one guy's day.
00:00:42 I want that guy to leave a comment and explain why.
00:00:45 I want him curious.
00:00:46 Yeah, I want to see the yes-cybershell-no-watch guy.
00:00:51 Oblivion follows here.
00:00:53 Hi, I've ruined everything.
00:00:55 Yeah.
00:00:56 CeCe is here.
00:00:57 The Tails Gets Trolls manager, tape and primer, and me, Ben St, and Gibb and take.
00:01:07 Did you forget Simsie?
00:01:09 Oh, I did forget Simsie, sorry.
00:01:11 I'm the background presence.
00:01:12 I'm only here because we thought Gibb wasn't going to be here and we needed a British person
00:01:15 to direct all those two.
00:01:18 There's two people here that I wasn't expecting to be here, so there's too many, but that's
00:01:23 okay.
00:01:24 We're bringing back the old episodes where people just talk over each other all the time
00:01:28 and yell.
00:01:30 Everybody likes them.
00:01:31 Everybody liked the one with Tisnaker because it was just a lot of yelling, a lot of talking
00:01:39 over each other, and it was good.
00:01:41 That's what people liked it.
00:01:43 Well, that's good to know.
00:01:46 So, Gibb, do you want to explain why are you here?
00:01:53 You weren't supposed to be here.
00:01:55 I wasn't supposed to be here.
00:01:56 I was supposed to be in the air or at the airport because I was going to fly out to
00:02:01 Boston to see Munchie and Ben and everyone, and it's going to be a fun time, but it was
00:02:08 going to be a fun time.
00:02:12 But there's a COVID problem, and it came up at the exact last possible moment it could
00:02:18 have come up this morning, the day I was supposed to be gone by now, but my dad tested positive,
00:02:26 and because we can't be sure that I don't have it already, because it's likely that
00:02:34 if he was infectious earlier and not symptomatic, then everyone in the house is infected, and
00:02:43 I wouldn't have time to figure it out.
00:02:48 So I'm probably going to get COVID in a couple of days, and I can't go and see my friends,
00:02:52 but it sucks.
00:02:57 That's all.
00:02:58 It just really sucks.
00:03:01 Yeah, I also got COVID from my dad.
00:03:05 Oh, really?
00:03:06 Yeah.
00:03:07 He probably got it from work, and yeah, everyone's getting it, but I'm better now, mostly.
00:03:16 Who's had COVID?
00:03:17 Simsie, you have not had COVID.
00:03:19 Cybershell, have you had COVID yet?
00:03:20 I've not had COVID, apart from getting the shot and feeling shitty.
00:03:25 That sort of counts, but no, I haven't actually got it, because I've just been inside all
00:03:29 the time, and I refuse to be social with anyone, ever.
00:03:33 I literally never leave the house except for groceries, but I've still managed to get it
00:03:37 twice.
00:03:38 Amazing.
00:03:39 I'm still recovering from it.
00:03:41 This is the penalty for having things like friends and family.
00:03:46 How dare you?
00:03:47 I lived in a tiny university house with fucking four people, and one bathroom, and my friend
00:03:57 she got it, and somehow none of the rest of us caught it, and in the full two weeks that
00:04:04 she was positive.
00:04:05 Impressive.
00:04:06 I don't understand how that happened.
00:04:07 What was she, pacing in the garden or something?
00:04:09 I don't understand.
00:04:10 Women aren't even real, that's why.
00:04:12 True.
00:04:13 Women aren't as extremely, not extremely, but higher, like transmission easier.
00:04:20 Easy transmission.
00:04:21 It's like twice as easy or something.
00:04:24 You just need to breathe near someone, or not even cough.
00:04:27 Less lethal.
00:04:28 That's a good right, question mark.
00:04:31 I don't really know enough about this shit to be like making definitive statements.
00:04:36 They say that, but then I've seen other experts be like, no, probably not.
00:04:41 It's probably just that people have more immunity now due to vaccinations and antibodies due
00:04:49 to previous infections.
00:04:52 That's probably the reason for the reduced hospitalizations and deaths.
00:04:56 Speaking of reduced.
00:04:57 I've seen conflicting opinions.
00:04:58 I wanted to leave a comment on, I can't remember if it was the last episode, and you're like,
00:05:01 is Ben okay?
00:05:02 His brain sounds a little shrunken lately.
00:05:04 I don't know what that's about.
00:05:08 It is, but not necessarily due to COVID, but maybe due to COVID.
00:05:12 That might just be a natural thing happening to everybody.
00:05:15 I mean, that's a good point because I've been vaccinated twice.
00:05:21 I got the booster and everything too, and I still got it, but the symptoms weren't
00:05:25 bad.
00:05:26 I heard it here first, folks.
00:05:27 Vaccines don't work.
00:05:28 Don't get them.
00:05:29 They don't.
00:05:30 They're an anti-vax podcast now.
00:05:33 You're better off without them, actually.
00:05:36 Okay.
00:05:38 YouTube, please don't pretend I didn't say that, YouTube.
00:05:41 Kill Ben.
00:05:42 The algorithm doesn't like it.
00:05:43 The management at Sims 4 does not support this message.
00:05:49 If COVID does shrink your brain, if everyone gets COVID, it evens out because then everyone
00:05:56 will be stupider.
00:05:58 No, think about it like this.
00:06:01 On balance.
00:06:02 Think about it like this.
00:06:03 If it's smaller, the neurons will have less to travel to be fired from the distance would
00:06:11 be smaller.
00:06:12 You'd actually think even quicker.
00:06:15 You think your brain is going to be ... It actually just makes it more efficient, makes
00:06:20 it more aerodynamic, actually.
00:06:22 The shrinking is superior.
00:06:24 You can have enhanced reflexes like Spiderman.
00:06:27 Maybe it's the racist part of your brain that gets shrunk, and this is a good thing
00:06:30 for society.
00:06:32 Well, I mean Daredevil is blind, but because of that, he has super hearing and proprioception.
00:06:39 Because of that, his brain shrunk.
00:06:42 Ben, Daredevil is not real.
00:06:45 You get COVID, I don't care.
00:06:47 You get COVID, you lose your sense of smell and taste, so probably your other senses get
00:06:51 more powerful to compensate.
00:06:53 You're going to be COVID Daredevil.
00:06:54 It's logical.
00:06:55 You're going to be out there fighting crime with your bandana over your nose.
00:07:00 COVID Daredevil, he lost his sense of smell and taste, but now his sense of ... I don't
00:07:06 know, his sense of balance is really good.
00:07:09 Cum production has increased.
00:07:11 He's also blind, not because of COVID.
00:07:13 He just happened to be blind anyway, so that one didn't get improved.
00:07:18 He's blind because he's a fan of Netflix's Daredevil, so he just wants to go the full
00:07:24 nine yards and cosplay.
00:07:27 That's why he's blind, just because he likes Daredevil.
00:07:35 So anyway, I finally got a test.
00:07:40 I used my last test on New Year's because I thought I would be negative and I would
00:07:47 be able to party on New Year's, but alas, I was still positive.
00:07:52 So I was like, fuck.
00:07:53 So New Year's is ruined.
00:07:55 But then I could not find any more tests, so even though I'm almost certainly was negative
00:08:00 shortly after that, I was not able to confirm it.
00:08:04 So it took me like a week until my friend Dwoob brought me over a test, because he found
00:08:10 one in a pharmacy.
00:08:11 So now I am officially negative, finally.
00:08:14 So that's good news, I guess.
00:08:16 Took a while.
00:08:17 Yeah.
00:08:18 What a hassle.
00:08:19 What a drag.
00:08:20 Yeah, this disease thing ain't so good.
00:08:25 Get rid of it.
00:08:26 In my opinion, the coronavirus is bad.
00:08:30 Excuse me.
00:08:31 I was informed COVID would be over by now.
00:08:33 I'm done with this COVID shit.
00:08:35 I'm done pretending that I'm going to care about it.
00:08:37 I'm just going to pretend like it doesn't exist and go about my daily life and infect
00:08:40 everyone.
00:08:41 At least you're honest.
00:08:46 I think that's the way to do it.
00:08:49 Also the economy.
00:08:50 It's going to last for a couple more years.
00:08:52 Is good.
00:08:53 Coronavirus bad.
00:08:55 The economy, good.
00:08:58 No masks, no doctors, baby 2022.
00:09:02 Are you running for president?
00:09:05 Yeah.
00:09:06 Well, I will be old enough by the next election cycle, so there we go.
00:09:14 Oh, scary Ben, dying of old age.
00:09:17 I shouldn't say that.
00:09:18 I shouldn't say that out loud.
00:09:20 Ben's going to be 78.
00:09:22 I'm as old as Jesus was when he was crucified.
00:09:27 Think about that.
00:09:28 And you've done as much, if not more, with your life.
00:09:35 And I'm going to be crucified.
00:09:36 Jesus didn't even have a podcast.
00:09:37 He had a bunch of followers, sure, but they didn't buy a shirt, so they didn't do anything.
00:09:45 I mean, Jesus was like the first podcast.
00:09:49 The Sermon on the Mount was a legendary podcast.
00:09:51 I feel like I've made that exact joke before.
00:09:55 I say it and I'm like, sounds familiar.
00:09:57 It was a good episode.
00:10:00 It was a good episode, but it goes down with a bit more editing.
00:10:02 I should have gone living full to soul, that one out.
00:10:05 Oh yeah, I'm the only one who can edit good, clearly.
00:10:07 I know that there's PCP mega fans out there that are going to like, anytime you reuse
00:10:11 a joke, they're going to have a comment like, didn't you actually use this joke back in
00:10:15 episode 141?
00:10:16 It's like, okay, thank you so much.
00:10:19 I don't, frankly, frankly, I don't think so.
00:10:22 I don't think PCP viewers are that astute.
00:10:25 I don't think they have what it takes to call me out on something like that.
00:10:30 I think they're a bunch of dummies.
00:10:31 I think they're a bunch of roots.
00:10:32 Therefore, it's okay to just reuse jokes and content from years past.
00:10:36 Dude, I used so many jokes in Cluster Punk Kitchen and no one noticed.
00:10:40 I had to be self-aware about it and still no one could even remember what the joke
00:10:45 that was reused was.
00:10:47 I mean, you use them a certain amount of times and it becomes, and it's endearing.
00:10:52 There's a sweet spot for reuse.
00:10:55 Like, Cluster Punk Kitchen was you as well.
00:10:58 Yeah, it was all revealed yesterday.
00:11:01 Oh, that's right, Gibby.
00:11:02 Gibby, you weren't on the last episode.
00:11:05 We delved into all of the...
00:11:06 I saw the thing and it was like, everything revealed, but I forgot about Cluster Punk
00:11:09 Kitchen.
00:11:10 I remember there was...
00:11:15 Oh, wait, let me ask you.
00:11:17 There was some confusion because there was some guy who would call in to say like, racist
00:11:21 shit and he had a deep voice and I occasionally confused him with Cluster Punk Kitchen.
00:11:29 Did you ever get frustrated?
00:11:30 They'd like, no, that's not, that wasn't me.
00:11:33 I actually don't remember.
00:11:35 I've ever called in and said anything racist, I don't think.
00:11:40 There was a guy who I thought was the Cluster Punk Kitchen guy because he just happened to
00:11:45 have a deep voice, but no, it was just a coincidence.
00:11:50 I don't think that would have been me.
00:11:53 I don't think I've ever...
00:11:54 No, I know it wasn't you.
00:11:57 I'm saying I thought it was you and I said it...
00:12:01 Yeah, I know, I know.
00:12:03 I'm just like, huh, I don't know.
00:12:05 I don't actually remember.
00:12:06 There's so many of them.
00:12:08 I remember the guy as well.
00:12:11 We haven't shown a few of his voicemails on the show because they were just like...
00:12:18 After a while, we eventually just started to be like, stop.
00:12:21 Anti-black lives, sort of like, okay, this guy's fucked.
00:12:24 He's like this very racist shit.
00:12:26 It wasn't even funny.
00:12:27 It wasn't even funny.
00:12:28 It wasn't funny.
00:12:29 Well, that's the main thing.
00:12:30 I mean, if you're going to be racist, at least be funny about it.
00:12:33 I mean, kind of.
00:12:34 Yeah.
00:12:35 It's strange to me.
00:12:36 There's like a deranged, like racist person, but who's also still a PCP fan for some reason.
00:12:42 It's like, I better submit my voicemails just so they know it's up.
00:12:45 Well, haven't heard from him in a while, so he may have finally been weeded out of the
00:12:52 pack.
00:12:53 Wow.
00:12:54 Turns out, Ben, figure out, you just have to stop playing the bad voicemails if you don't
00:12:58 want to get the bad voicemails.
00:13:00 Yeah.
00:13:01 If I were to say something racist, it'd be like, oh, black people have small toes and
00:13:07 I don't like it.
00:13:08 It'd be like something stupid like that.
00:13:10 Oh, clip that.
00:13:11 Clip that one.
00:13:12 No reason to live.
00:13:13 Canceled.
00:13:18 Yeah, I voicemail anarchy, basically.
00:13:22 There was like very rare, very rare exceptions for like, and it was only people who made
00:13:28 like repeated attempts to make like deliberately shitty voicemails.
00:13:34 Everyone gets one shitty voicemail.
00:13:37 Yeah.
00:13:38 Yeah, kind of.
00:13:39 It was the only time I would be like, Eleazar, just edit this out and pretend we didn't do
00:13:43 it because it's not even funny.
00:13:45 It's not engaging.
00:13:46 It sucks.
00:13:47 Yeah.
00:13:48 Like occasionally we do have like somebody who has like a weirdo opinion about something
00:13:51 that we address and then it's not so bad.
00:13:55 There's a discussion there.
00:13:57 Otherwise it could be funny.
00:13:58 It's only been like two or three times that someone's just been so like gross, not even
00:14:06 like in a gross like poo poo way because those ones annoyingly get played on the show and
00:14:10 I don't like it when somebody takes a shit and records it.
00:14:14 But like.
00:14:15 Oh yeah.
00:14:16 Oh yeah.
00:14:17 Oh, that stays in.
00:14:18 That's all content.
00:14:19 But like gross topic wise and opinion wise, it's only happened like three or four times.
00:14:26 I don't like bad people.
00:14:28 Anyone else with me?
00:14:29 I don't like bad people.
00:14:30 You guys don't even understand.
00:14:31 Coming out with all the like the best tips right now, Simsie.
00:14:34 Wow.
00:14:35 No, Simsie, you can't say that.
00:14:38 We have so many bad people in our audience.
00:14:41 You can't say that.
00:14:42 You'll offend them.
00:14:43 Fuck you.
00:14:44 There's so many people that suck that listen to the PCP.
00:14:48 It's our main demographic.
00:14:49 I hope you guys are ready for next week's voice mails.
00:14:52 Uh oh.
00:14:55 I think every week for now they're going to be like 15 minutes long because you're not
00:14:58 going to have all the good ones.
00:14:59 It's just going to be the shitty low effort ones.
00:15:02 No.
00:15:03 No way.
00:15:04 If you're if you're longer than two minutes, you get auto deleted.
00:15:10 I don't care.
00:15:11 Actually, I think the time limit is 130.
00:15:13 So I don't think they evenly.
00:15:15 Oh, on the topic of bad people, I guess I can bring up the I guess I can bring up the
00:15:21 weird shit that happened on Furious Cat for me.
00:15:23 I tweeted about it yesterday.
00:15:25 I saw yeah, I saw you getting or tweeted something about it.
00:15:29 Sure.
00:15:30 Yeah.
00:15:31 I've drawn like a few more like dogs.
00:15:33 By the way, everyone follows Simsie.
00:15:35 Everyone follows Simsie.
00:15:36 Is it at Simsie fart?
00:15:37 Yeah.
00:15:38 Simsie fart because art was taken and boy was taken so I thought whatever and Simsie
00:15:42 was taken.
00:15:43 But I have a Curious Cat page that like Simsie for big, big booby, big booby mommy milkers.
00:15:49 Hell yeah.
00:15:50 Hell yeah.
00:15:51 There's that website Curious Cat, which is just basically a Q&A website where people
00:15:55 can submit questions anonymously.
00:15:57 And somebody noticed that I'd been drawing slightly more dark skinned girls than usual
00:16:01 recently.
00:16:02 Which is not like intentional or anything.
00:16:04 How dare I exactly.
00:16:06 Uh oh.
00:16:07 Uh oh.
00:16:08 We got we got a problem here.
00:16:09 Yeah.
00:16:10 And they and they sent me a bunch of fucking questions that weren't even questions.
00:16:13 They were just saying like, damn, that's just horrible racist chair and it's like fuck
00:16:18 off.
00:16:20 Yeah.
00:16:21 You know what I mean?
00:16:22 I don't understand why some of you so motivated just from seeing a drawing to do that.
00:16:26 That's mindbrained.
00:16:27 No, I also, I also don't understand.
00:16:30 People bad.
00:16:31 Uh, uh, if you don't cyber cyber shell, you, you, you must, you understand your, your,
00:16:37 your, your kind of that like that.
00:16:38 Why don't you explain why people do that?
00:16:40 Uh, what do you mean?
00:16:41 Why I'm kind of like that.
00:16:43 I feel bad.
00:16:44 I was making a joke, but now I feel bad.
00:16:46 I was just going to say, this is, um, first of all, you're right.
00:16:49 There, there, there's a bunch of deranged lunatics out there.
00:16:52 I'm not saying it's your fault, but like, this is why I don't even have a curious cat.
00:16:55 I don't want people to be able to anonymously ask me things.
00:16:57 Fuck you.
00:16:58 If you want to ask me something, show me your identity piece of shit.
00:17:02 Yeah.
00:17:03 Yeah.
00:17:04 That's true.
00:17:05 I am.
00:17:06 I just have a curious cat.
00:17:07 I, I support, I support the alternative service, Brony Curious is much better.
00:17:13 Like the people sent cyber shell weird enough shit on Twitter.
00:17:16 Like there was this guy who kept asking or he kept replying to every post that cyber
00:17:20 shell made asking about like if Sonic is pregnant or something.
00:17:25 That guy, at least, you know, those were annoying, but like that guy thought he was being funny.
00:17:29 At least that guy thought he was being funny.
00:17:32 Like, you know, there's a difference between those guys and people who will just go out
00:17:35 of their way to send like deranged racist shit.
00:17:37 The attempt, the attempt, oh yeah, that's true.
00:17:40 Yeah.
00:17:42 You know, I remember, I think, I remember Formspring, that was kind of like Curious Cat, right?
00:17:48 Just a website where you could ask someone questions.
00:17:51 Yeah.
00:17:52 Right.
00:17:53 It's like an ask FM kind of type deal.
00:17:55 I mean, I understand the appeal of those sites.
00:17:56 I wasn't completely shitting on them.
00:17:58 I just personally am like, fuck you, I'm not, I'm not answering any questions, fuck you.
00:18:04 I remember Andrew Hussie had a lot of really good, a lot of people asked him like Homestuck
00:18:09 Lore questions and a lot of info, a lot of great insight was gleaned from his Formspring
00:18:16 answers about stuff back in the day, which was cool.
00:18:20 I like those.
00:18:22 I think Formspring is like dead now, or, wasn't there some shit where Curious Cat was dead
00:18:27 a few like a week ago and everyone's like, oh, yeah, it just came back.
00:18:30 I don't know.
00:18:31 Yeah, I was going to mention that.
00:18:32 And then there was like a bunch of people saying, oh, don't use it.
00:18:34 It's like compromised.
00:18:35 And there was like a day later, people came on like, it's not really compromised.
00:18:38 I don't know why everyone was saying that, but that's why I checked it is because it
00:18:41 came out.
00:18:42 I hadn't looked at it for like months and I checked it and it was just all this fucking
00:18:44 horrible shit over months that someone had sent me.
00:18:46 I think it was about like 10 messages and it's like, what the fuck, why?
00:18:52 People are mental, man.
00:18:53 Yeah, mental.
00:18:54 Do you do you get a lot of questions on and I would no trust me?
00:18:58 Oh, no, absolutely not.
00:18:59 No, really, like that was like 90 percent of the stuff that had been sent to me over the
00:19:03 last few months because I haven't barely used it.
00:19:07 I just checked it because I heard Curious Cat was back and I was like, OK, wait, it was
00:19:11 gone. What? And then I looked and I was like, oh, well, I'm looking at it right now and
00:19:15 it says it's under maintenance.
00:19:17 I don't never mind.
00:19:19 I don't know. Speaking of stuff that I've been seeing recently, have you guys been
00:19:25 playing Wordle?
00:19:27 Have you guys been wordling?
00:19:28 Oh, yeah, I have seen that on my timeline.
00:19:31 I don't even know.
00:19:31 Is that is that a Pokemon?
00:19:34 It does sound like a Pokemon.
00:19:35 Wordle, Wordle rules.
00:19:38 I've played three now and I'm three for three here.
00:19:42 I'll post the.
00:19:44 Yeah, it's it's the if you've been seeing these little graphics, these little emoji
00:19:49 graphics that people have been it shows it shows like your score.
00:19:54 Let me find one.
00:19:54 I did I did one earlier today.
00:19:56 I'll show my score from Wordle 204.
00:20:02 Where is it?
00:20:03 Here we go.
00:20:04 Oh, yeah.
00:20:05 Copy and paste in that.
00:20:06 That looks good.
00:20:08 That looks real good.
00:20:10 There we go.
00:20:11 Read them and we.
00:20:13 OK, I've seen those.
00:20:14 Yeah.
00:20:16 I have no idea what it is.
00:20:17 So it's.
00:20:19 How does this work?
00:20:20 I'm on the page.
00:20:20 It's it.
00:20:21 But yeah, well, you word guessing you make sense.
00:20:25 Yeah, you have to get it sort of like mastermind, but with a word.
00:20:30 You ever play Mastermind?
00:20:32 I know the TV show Mastermind.
00:20:35 It's simple.
00:20:35 It'll just tell you if you get the letter in the right place, it'll be green.
00:20:38 And if you get the letter in the correct letter, but in the wrong place,
00:20:42 it'll be yellow. It's pretty much that simple.
00:20:44 So I got a blank thing and I press A and it's wrong.
00:20:48 So what do I do?
00:20:49 Matt, Mastermind is a game where like your opponent chooses a sequence
00:20:54 of four colors and you basically have to like make a series of guesses
00:20:58 about of like colors, a series of colors, and he has to tell you like, OK,
00:21:03 you you got one color right, but it was in the wrong place or you got one
00:21:06 color right and it was in the right place and stuff like that.
00:21:10 So word is like that.
00:21:11 You guess a fight.
00:21:12 You have to guess a five letter word and you have like five or six guesses.
00:21:15 So you have to put it.
00:21:17 You have to type in a five letter word and then it will tell you
00:21:21 which of your letters in your word were correct, but in the wrong place
00:21:25 or correct in the right place.
00:21:29 And because you have a series of guesses,
00:21:32 it gives you this cute little this cute little emoji code.
00:21:37 You know, your your series of guesses forms a little little pattern
00:21:41 that makes for a nice little postable post here.
00:21:45 Because look how great it is.
00:21:47 Because the question is the same for everyone every each day, isn't it?
00:21:51 So like, yes, why they do it as emojis as opposed to people just screenshotting
00:21:55 the results because we just spoil it for everybody.
00:21:57 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So.
00:22:00 Yeah, don't no, no, no, no, it's not the same.
00:22:02 Same. Everyone everyone gets one word a day
00:22:04 and it's the same word for everybody.
00:22:06 They do it in different languages, too, which is kind of cool.
00:22:10 If you speak multiple languages, you can play multiple games.
00:22:13 So wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:22:14 What is the strategy?
00:22:15 You just guess a random five letter word and then from there
00:22:19 you have some information with which to make more guesses that are more correct.
00:22:25 Yeah, like, see, my first guess, you know,
00:22:29 it gave me that one yellow square.
00:22:31 So I knew that that letter was in the final word,
00:22:34 but it's not in the right place.
00:22:36 I got two greens on my first try.
00:22:38 So that's pretty lucky.
00:22:41 That's super are all the letters, five words.
00:22:46 Or all what all the five letters.
00:22:49 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:51 OK, if you guys enjoy wordal viewers right now,
00:22:54 I'm not trying to hear it a shit on you or whatever,
00:22:56 but I instantly lost interest in this game once I realized
00:23:00 you can just game the system by if you just search the words O read,
00:23:03 hints, clump and gawky.
00:23:05 That's like 20 letters.
00:23:07 You will guarantee to be able to figure out the word, basically,
00:23:10 from just having inputted all those letters.
00:23:12 You know what I mean?
00:23:13 Like there's systems you can do to basically guarantee
00:23:18 that you're going to be able to figure it out.
00:23:20 Oh, I mean, I mean, necessarily if you're just trying to figure it out,
00:23:26 I guess if you're trying to like get the best score.
00:23:28 This is one of those games you have to use the honor system, right?
00:23:31 Because I mean, obviously, like, yeah, you can just.
00:23:33 Yeah, it's about how you really cared that much, I guess, about score.
00:23:36 It's about how few it's about how few guesses can you get it in.
00:23:40 And then you brag and you post your results
00:23:44 and you make you hope that everyone else looks.
00:23:46 Hey, everyone, I'm really good at this guessing game over here.
00:23:49 So I just want to brag about that.
00:23:52 I'm really good at tic-tac-toe.
00:23:53 I win it almost every time against.
00:23:55 I'm really good at hangman.
00:23:58 I'm trying so hard to think of a of a word that ends in this letter,
00:24:02 but I don't.
00:24:05 How do I?
00:24:06 It's impossible.
00:24:08 This one, this one confused me.
00:24:10 This one was a little bit tricky.
00:24:12 This is the third of the last three that I played.
00:24:13 This was the trickiest.
00:24:15 Today was going to be the first one I played,
00:24:16 but I looked at someone's screenshot beforehand and I realized, oh, shit.
00:24:19 That was today's one.
00:24:21 Get fucked, loser.
00:24:24 Can you play a game?
00:24:25 Yeah, true.
00:24:26 Yeah, true.
00:24:27 I have to wait all the way until tomorrow.
00:24:31 Can you do pass?
00:24:32 I guess there would be no reason to do pass ones
00:24:34 if you can just look up the answers.
00:24:36 I tried to look up if you could like choose a different puzzle,
00:24:39 but it looks like it's just the one for the day.
00:24:42 I don't know.
00:24:43 I didn't look at it too long.
00:24:45 It's weird. Why wouldn't they let you do old ones?
00:24:51 Because it's a big community Web 3.0 metaverse thing, Ben.
00:24:56 That doesn't explain anything.
00:25:00 Web 3.0, I'm just going to keep saying that until you accept it and move on.
00:25:03 Well, oh, fuck.
00:25:05 It's like, oh, yeah, this is all like we're all actually secretly
00:25:08 like solving the human genome with all this like computing power
00:25:12 that we're putting in.
00:25:13 If this was like truly Web 3.0, I'd expect it to be like every time
00:25:16 you finish a wordle, it's like you completed a wordle.
00:25:18 Would you like to purchase your wordle as an NFT?
00:25:22 I would.
00:25:23 Dublock chain.
00:25:25 Would you like some of Dublock chain?
00:25:29 What did I want?
00:25:29 Chain, more like.
00:25:30 What blockchain?
00:25:31 What blockchain shit did I see this week that sucked?
00:25:35 Oh, Bitcoin is crashing a bit right now.
00:25:37 It's it's not doing super great.
00:25:40 What's the point of crypto?
00:25:41 Crypto just crashes every time the stock market crashes.
00:25:45 It doesn't it doesn't free you from anything.
00:25:47 It's completely tied to the bullshit via currency that everyone's like,
00:25:51 oh, it's so it frees us from this.
00:25:53 No, it doesn't.
00:25:54 Did the stock market also crash?
00:25:55 I didn't even know about it.
00:25:56 I haven't I don't pay attention to money.
00:25:59 I refuse to learn about any financial knowledge.
00:26:01 I choose to live in ignorance and be stupid about my cyber show.
00:26:06 I love your bank account.
00:26:07 I love money.
00:26:08 I love money so much.
00:26:10 Yes, you can.
00:26:11 That's how stupid I am about money.
00:26:13 I just give out my bank account details to anyone who will ask publicly
00:26:16 on a password and credit card info and just send me your credit card in the mail.
00:26:20 I'm going to read three credit card number is three.
00:26:24 Oh my god, I just got really overwhelming urge to.
00:26:28 I so the card I'm currently churning is my American Express business cash blue.
00:26:36 And I just got the overwhelming urge to read out the funny little numbers on it.
00:26:40 Obviously, I must every time you talk about hard churning,
00:26:43 I imagine you like dressed up like an Amish person churning butter,
00:26:46 but like sitting there over it's your little car.
00:26:49 It's like that.
00:26:50 It's exactly like that.
00:26:52 You know, I think I imagine making butter like one of those those.
00:26:59 Oh, oh, no, I got covid one of those.
00:27:04 Oh, God, it might be.
00:27:05 There's a fucking satisfying to look at like metal crushing machines
00:27:11 with two like cylinders that grab something and crush it.
00:27:14 I guess that's what I imagine when you card churn.
00:27:17 Is that you're throwing cards into metal roller, a flat roller, crushing machine.
00:27:22 It's a crushing machine.
00:27:23 There's like with like interlocking teeth, two cylinders going inwards to it.
00:27:28 And you people just throw a conveyor belt and like a tub is like a funnel.
00:27:34 And then there's things like oh, but the rollers have like ridges on them.
00:27:40 And the ridges like interlock with each other, right?
00:27:42 Grab things and you can throw like animal carcasses into the animals.
00:27:46 You can throw like steel beams.
00:27:48 You can throw anything.
00:27:50 Well, you can throw the robot dog from Walton Gromit Clochette.
00:27:53 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
00:27:56 That's right.
00:27:57 I had a little toy.
00:28:00 He was scared.
00:28:01 Oh, yeah, pressed in the pressed in the cyberdog.
00:28:03 What a legend.
00:28:05 I watched all of those with my dad on Christmas.
00:28:07 That was great.
00:28:09 Last Christmas, I gave my dad watched Flushed.
00:28:14 We watched Flushed Away.
00:28:16 We talked about my dad's a big Aardman fan.
00:28:18 We watched Flushed Away and I loved I loved it.
00:28:20 Flushed Away is cool.
00:28:22 It's pretty weird.
00:28:23 It was really good.
00:28:24 I think I talked about it last year, but I thought was like, wow.
00:28:28 I was like, what a what a what a great little what a great little flick.
00:28:32 What a great little like, you know, clean and satisfying
00:28:35 little three act heroes journey that was.
00:28:39 I was very compelled by it.
00:28:42 It was I loved it.
00:28:44 I've never seen it, but didn't they like
00:28:46 like imitate the stop motion with like animation?
00:28:51 They just did it.
00:28:52 The animation.
00:28:53 It was animated by Dreamworks, but in the style of Aardman,
00:28:56 like in the character design style and like with the limited frame rate stuff
00:28:59 on the faces, I think the bodies were completely smooth.
00:29:02 But yeah, it's cool.
00:29:03 Yes, it was a pretty good.
00:29:04 I think that's interesting.
00:29:05 You got Hugh Grant and as the guy, right, as the main man.
00:29:10 Yeah, that sounds that sounds right.
00:29:12 Yeah, that sounds right.
00:29:14 And you got Ian McKellen as the funny frog.
00:29:16 And he goes, I'm a man of quality.
00:29:20 Right. Good movie.
00:29:22 This is a good movie.
00:29:23 This year, I didn't get to watch anything with my family for Christmas
00:29:27 because I was quarantined with coronavirus.
00:29:31 I still fucking pissed off about it.
00:29:35 I'm fucking mad.
00:29:37 I fucking in terms of festivities for new years.
00:29:43 I went around a friend's house and I got very, very drunk.
00:29:45 I was the only person who drank more than one beer.
00:29:49 That's what I wanted to do, but I was still positive.
00:29:52 My dad drove me home and I was almost sick on the way home.
00:29:55 So I had to step out and I just took a piss behind a bus stop.
00:29:57 And I was like, I'm still doing this.
00:30:00 I'm twenty two and I'm still doing this.
00:30:02 And then wait till you're thirty three and still doing it.
00:30:05 Yeah, I got home.
00:30:08 I've omitted like six times and put on trailer park boys on my phone.
00:30:12 And then I then then I suddenly was conscious again.
00:30:15 And it had been two hours and I can tell because six episodes had gone by.
00:30:18 And I was like, damn, I have passed out on the toilet for two hours.
00:30:21 Great. Sounds very uncomfortable.
00:30:24 Oh, I was fine.
00:30:25 I'm a grown boy. I can still do it.
00:30:29 We only twenty two, you're just a baby.
00:30:30 I know.
00:30:32 I feel old because my back always hurts from work, which is great
00:30:35 because I have to haul potatoes all night because I have a night job at the supermarket.
00:30:40 Maybe you should put the potatoes down.
00:30:44 No, but you've got to put them on the shelf, give.
00:30:45 Did you know that?
00:30:47 Did you know that you've got to put potatoes on the shelf in the store?
00:30:49 No, interesting.
00:30:50 Tatoes are interesting shelves.
00:30:53 Interesting grocery store fact.
00:30:57 You know, the shit you're supposed to keep cold
00:31:00 during the night when you're doing delivery.
00:31:01 It just sits in the middle of the aisle for hours, not in the fridge
00:31:04 because it takes so long to like put it on the shelf.
00:31:07 So all that chicken you're eating has just been sat there for at least four
00:31:10 hours every night, not refrigerated, which I mean, delicious.
00:31:14 That's I would do that in my own home.
00:31:19 So what a recommendation is that you need to chuck anything
00:31:23 that's been out for like two hours, though.
00:31:26 Well, what makes you think I would follow a health recommendation?
00:31:30 Well, guess what?
00:31:31 Every single piece of fucking poultry in the shop that I work at
00:31:35 has been left out for at least four hours.
00:31:38 So that's cool.
00:31:40 I hope I don't shop there.
00:31:41 That opens my eyes a little bit.
00:31:43 It's more efficient that way.
00:31:44 I'm not going to say the name.
00:31:44 It's called chicken churning.
00:31:46 Exactly.
00:31:47 Oh, about wordle, when you put a letter and it's gray,
00:31:52 that means it's not anywhere in the world, right?
00:31:55 Correct. That's right.
00:31:56 That's right. Wow.
00:31:59 So it's eliminated.
00:32:01 It snowed here the other day.
00:32:04 It actually just like two days ago, it snowed like a lot.
00:32:07 There's like a foot and a half of snow on the ground
00:32:09 or might be starting to melt finally.
00:32:12 First first serious snow of the winter.
00:32:15 Every time there's snow, I'm just so happy because it looks so pretty.
00:32:18 But then I have to remember, I'm not a kid.
00:32:20 I don't get school like days of school off because of snow.
00:32:23 It just makes my life worse and harder.
00:32:26 Yeah. Fortunately, I'm blessed to be a renter.
00:32:30 You know, I'm blessed not to own property.
00:32:33 So I'm not responsible for shoveling anything.
00:32:36 You know, that's that's that's interesting because when I was a kid,
00:32:39 I was like, oh, I wish I lived somewhere where there was snow
00:32:42 so I could have school off.
00:32:44 But now that I'm old, I'm like, oh, I'm glad I don't fucking have to deal with that shit.
00:32:48 Dude, I did.
00:32:48 Well, if you live in like Virginia or something,
00:32:51 if you even get like a quarter of an inch of snow,
00:32:53 like everything shuts, you don't have to shovel it.
00:32:55 But everything just shuts down instantly
00:32:57 because the infrastructure is simply not prepared.
00:33:01 I got it in four. I got it in four.
00:33:02 That happens once every like five.
00:33:05 Oh, very good.
00:33:06 Now you're addicted.
00:33:06 Now you know the addicting rush of figuring out a word.
00:33:11 Yeah, you know, wordle seems like a thing.
00:33:14 Seems like a kind of give core.
00:33:15 It definitely did.
00:33:16 Game. I love it.
00:33:18 I like it. I like.
00:33:20 I've played it three days straight now
00:33:22 and we'll see how long I keep my streak up.
00:33:27 I was enticed.
00:33:28 I was enticed by the little emoji cubes.
00:33:32 I was just like, who made this?
00:33:34 How are they making money off of this?
00:33:36 I need to know.
00:33:39 I'm not comfortable using this until I know how the it's monetized.
00:33:43 It's not about the money.
00:33:44 It's about sending a fun word puzzle to a fun round.
00:33:47 It's about the mitts.
00:33:49 Game, how did you how did you get it like that?
00:33:51 How did you get no yellows?
00:33:52 I thought of, well, I got lucky on the first one
00:33:55 and then I got lucky on the second one.
00:33:58 And then I got lucky on the fourth one.
00:34:02 Well, there was only like, you know what the word is, right?
00:34:06 I'll tell you how she got it, Ben.
00:34:07 She thought, unlike you, your brain is twisted.
00:34:10 I got the second letter on the first try
00:34:12 and then nothing for the entire thing,
00:34:14 except for the last one where he accidentally got the last letter.
00:34:17 So I got fucked.
00:34:19 I realize I got it first try.
00:34:22 You can nobody nobody plays it on hard mode,
00:34:24 but there is a hard mode.
00:34:25 And what hard mode does is it means that you can't.
00:34:29 When once you guess a letter, you can't like change the letter
00:34:32 like that letter is locked in.
00:34:34 And I was like, huh?
00:34:35 And then I realized, oh, well, that's because
00:34:38 if you didn't have them locked in, you could just, you know,
00:34:42 yeah, guess an entire little system.
00:34:44 I had to work on hard mode.
00:34:45 I just found out about that.
00:34:46 Yeah, my full system.
00:34:49 No, I have to actually think about the stupid word.
00:34:52 I tend to basically play as though I'm on hard mode.
00:34:55 Wait, what?
00:34:56 What's the I put the word in right?
00:35:00 And I pressed enter and then the second one I put a word in
00:35:05 and then I like I could go back.
00:35:08 I could delete letters and no, no, no, no, I mean, again, you could.
00:35:12 Well, OK, you entered a word that had the green letters
00:35:15 in the right place. On hard mode, you have to do that.
00:35:19 Like, yellow doesn't count? What do you mean?
00:35:23 Yeah, well, on regular mode, you know, if you don't, you could have put
00:35:29 Once you've correctly guessed the letter, you can't not guess the letter.
00:35:33 You can't, like, guess something else that you know is going to cover a lot of bases, you know what I mean?
00:35:37 Like, you have to, like, make honest attempts is sort of how it works.
00:35:41 Oh, you mean, like, on the second one...
00:35:43 You can't, like, farm. You can't, like, put a bunch of random...
00:35:46 You can't put a bunch of vowels on your second attempt if you go to green one on your first.
00:35:50 Like, like...
00:35:51 Yeah, you have to use that green letter again.
00:35:53 To, like, see how many yellows you could have.
00:35:55 And be like, okay, these ones are in, and these ones are...
00:35:57 Right.
00:35:58 We have to type a real word. You can't just type random letters.
00:36:01 It should have just been hard mode by default. They should have just done that.
00:36:05 I might start playing on hard mode, actually.
00:36:08 Because, like, I always do it anyway.
00:36:13 So, like, fuck it.
00:36:14 I might as well get cred.
00:36:16 I might as well earn my props.
00:36:18 There better be a special thing on the tweet that you tweet out that's like,
00:36:20 by the way, this was on hard mode, so it's more important than all you other idiots.
00:36:24 It should have a little, like, star.
00:36:26 A little, like, shining star emoji.
00:36:28 Or instead of making it green, they could make it red.
00:36:31 But maybe people would get confused and think it was wrong.
00:36:34 I'm just going to start posting three, or excuse me,
00:36:36 posting five green boxes in a row and saying I got on the first try.
00:36:40 Like, every single day.
00:36:41 Make it purple.
00:36:42 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Every day. Every day.
00:36:44 Just, like, Wordle 204, one out of six.
00:36:46 Wordle 204, one out of four.
00:36:48 But I'm just going to acknowledge that I'm cheating.
00:36:49 I'm just going to be like, wow, hashtag blessed. I'm so lucky.
00:36:52 Yeah, don't... Everyone's asking, like, how'd you do this
00:36:54 and just refuse to elaborate.
00:36:56 It's like, I don't know.
00:36:58 I'm the world champion, bitch. I'm the best at Wordle in the world.
00:37:01 If you were as smart as me, you would also get it in one every time,
00:37:04 but you're not, so fuck off.
00:37:06 This sounds like another video game, like, clout swindle
00:37:10 that will somebody make a YouTube video about.
00:37:13 Yeah, this is the new, like, dream-cheating situation
00:37:16 that's going to blow up.
00:37:17 There's a guy who's, like, cheating at Wordle.
00:37:20 It's funny, too, because it's, like, the easiest thing
00:37:22 you could possibly cheat at. It's, like, you know...
00:37:24 Just Google the answers.
00:37:25 You just have to not do that if you care.
00:37:28 Is that Planet of the Apes?
00:37:30 No, it's not.
00:37:31 It's like humans, man. It's not an ape.
00:37:33 Oh.
00:37:34 There's, in the sequels to the original Planet of the Apes,
00:37:38 there's, like, a cult of humans underground
00:37:40 that worship an atom bomb.
00:37:41 Oh, yeah, I remember that.
00:37:43 Yeah, and they stole that for Fallout 3.
00:37:45 That's the anti-Hideo Kojima.
00:37:46 Ugh.
00:37:47 Okay, okay. Star Trek, of course. Disgusting.
00:37:50 Sorry, sorry.
00:37:52 I always like to try to ban.
00:37:54 I'm not allowed to talk about it on PCP.
00:37:56 Can we get Ben off of this podcast and get Nate back on
00:37:58 so we can talk about Star Trek?
00:37:59 No.
00:38:00 Anything but that.
00:38:02 Finally.
00:38:04 Finally, somebody had to say it.
00:38:06 Oh, why didn't Picard care about the Curlin' Nesco
00:38:09 when it was destroyed? I don't understand.
00:38:11 What the fuck? The pothole?
00:38:15 I'm not, I'm not a big, I'm not a big Trek guy.
00:38:18 I've seen some Trek. I guess it's alright.
00:38:20 I'm not a big Trek guy.
00:38:22 That's my opinion.
00:38:23 But, like, TNG's good. DS9's good.
00:38:26 TNG is the only one I've really watched, like,
00:38:29 even a significant amount.
00:38:31 It's the only one that interests me.
00:38:33 I'm a fake fan.
00:38:35 I would occasionally catch a DS9 or Voyager,
00:38:38 like, on TV when I was a kid.
00:38:40 But TNG was the one that I mostly...
00:38:43 I've probably seen, like, a dozen or so.
00:38:46 TNG's very serialized. You can just catch random ones
00:38:48 and enjoy it.
00:38:49 Or excuse me, TNG's very much just, like, you know,
00:38:52 random, you know, they're isolated episodes.
00:38:54 They stand on their own.
00:38:55 Whereas DS9 was more, like,
00:38:57 whoa, it's like a continuing serialized story
00:38:59 that, like, you know, there's, like, season-long arc.
00:39:01 Believe it or not, there was a time in TV history
00:39:03 when, like, the idea of a season-long arc was, like,
00:39:05 whoa, it was really interesting and exciting.
00:39:07 Like, wow, there's continuity.
00:39:09 Okay, when I was a kid,
00:39:11 and I caught an episode of the fucking X-Men cartoon,
00:39:16 and I realized, like, oh, this is, like, a whole, like, arc.
00:39:19 This is, like, a season-long arc.
00:39:20 It's not just, like, an episode.
00:39:22 Like, I have to watch the whole thing to understand what's going on.
00:39:24 I was, like, blown away.
00:39:25 I was, like, whoa, that's so cool.
00:39:28 And then I saw, like, the first three episodes,
00:39:30 and then I missed the fourth one, and then, like, I never caught up.
00:39:33 That's just how TV used to be.
00:39:34 Yeah, you'd have to catch it every week,
00:39:35 and you miss one, then you're just left out of the conversation.
00:39:38 Can you imagine that shit?
00:39:39 Yeah, I do.
00:39:40 Imagine, like, Game of Thrones, but in, like, the 90s.
00:39:42 Like, everyone's constantly talking about that stupid fucking show,
00:39:44 but if you missed an episode, you're just fucked.
00:39:47 If, okay, okay, okay, if Game of Thrones had come out, like,
00:39:50 like, back then, everybody would have had to watch it.
00:39:55 Like, they would have made so much money on ad revenue,
00:39:58 because everybody would have had to tune in to the network at the time.
00:40:03 Yeah, there is something really weird about that.
00:40:05 Like, TV used to be, like, a real, like, yeah.
00:40:07 Like, you knew you were watching it at the same time
00:40:09 as, like, all these other people, whereas now it's just, like,
00:40:12 oh, we release on Netflix, everyone go binge it at your own leisure,
00:40:15 which I'm not even, I'm not even saying that's a bad thing.
00:40:17 I'm just saying it's different.
00:40:20 Man, you guys...
00:40:23 I am.
00:40:24 Yeah.
00:40:25 I don't like that.
00:40:26 Binging is a thing you can do afterwards.
00:40:29 After...
00:40:30 It's a fun way to watch something.
00:40:32 Honestly, I miss the JoJo Fridays, like, how to say, I miss it.
00:40:35 It kind of allows too much to be missed.
00:40:37 It was just a whole thing.
00:40:38 Yeah.
00:40:39 If you do it for the first time.
00:40:40 Yeah, I used to do JoJo Fridays.
00:40:43 I used to do that.
00:40:44 But the, but I mean, you know, streaming exists.
00:40:47 There's no reason Netflix couldn't have released JoJo Part 6, like,
00:40:50 I don't know, they just don't like doing it weekly.
00:40:52 I guess I'm grateful they're doing batches of episodes rather than
00:40:55 just releasing the entire thing at once, but still kind of weird.
00:40:58 I think, I think I have, I have lost a lot of interest
00:41:04 in, like, media in general.
00:41:06 There's, like, very, very few, like, shows or games or anything that I'm like,
00:41:10 yeah, I really want to check that out.
00:41:12 I think one of the few things that could get me
00:41:16 to want to watch the show would be the feeling of, like,
00:41:19 everybody else is watching it.
00:41:21 My friends are watching it.
00:41:22 I want to be a part of the thing.
00:41:24 Yeah.
00:41:25 So that, that, like, community, like, like everybody's watching it at the same
00:41:28 night on the week, right?
00:41:30 We're all going to talk about it the next day.
00:41:32 That, I think that would be a big pull for me.
00:41:35 I think that would be one of the biggest pulls that they could,
00:41:37 they could use to exert their power over me to get me to watch their
00:41:41 stupid fucking show.
00:41:42 And they, and they've given it up.
00:41:44 They've given it up because, like, there's so many shows,
00:41:47 and they're all on streaming, and I could watch them any time I want,
00:41:51 but, like, ah, fuck it.
00:41:52 Hey, bells.
00:41:53 You know?
00:41:54 Why?
00:41:55 Yeah.
00:41:56 Well, it wasn't, it wasn't a weird game like that.
00:41:59 Have you heard of a serialized manga called One Piece that you could catch up
00:42:02 with and talk to people about?
00:42:05 I could, I could.
00:42:08 You could even go in the conversation of Talking Pirates on twitch.tv.
00:42:12 Damn.
00:42:13 Two years ago at Radcon 4, I almost caught up on One Piece.
00:42:18 And you're still writing off the coattails of almost catching up
00:42:21 one time two years ago.
00:42:23 And that, and that was then, yeah, and that was then,
00:42:26 and now I'm like, well, shit, I was almost,
00:42:28 I've been almost caught up for two years.
00:42:30 I guess I'm not anymore.
00:42:32 My friend is watching it.
00:42:33 He's not reading it.
00:42:34 He's watching the whole thing, and he's, I'm like,
00:42:36 Well, that's pain.
00:42:37 You're a psychopath, dude.
00:42:39 Yeah.
00:42:40 That's like, that would take so long to do.
00:42:43 I mean, how did this happen?
00:42:45 I watched the whole thing.
00:42:47 Jeez.
00:42:48 I watched like the first like, the first one.
00:42:50 Just the One Piece anime have filler in my heart.
00:42:52 I think I remember when it was.
00:42:54 I can't remember when it was.
00:42:55 It just has bad pacing.
00:42:56 It was up to like the other chapters.
00:42:57 Okay, okay, it does have, it does,
00:43:00 it does have some filler,
00:43:02 but some of the filler is actually really good.
00:43:04 Right.
00:43:05 Like there's that one arc, like when they come down from,
00:43:09 uh, fuck, what's from Skypea,
00:43:11 they land in that like, in that like prison island
00:43:14 and that's a whole filler arc in the anime.
00:43:16 Yeah.
00:43:18 That's really good.
00:43:19 That's a great.
00:43:20 Yeah.
00:43:21 Mostly the episodes are just really badly paced
00:43:23 and like slow.
00:43:24 It's because after the time skip,
00:43:25 they go to one chapter per episode,
00:43:27 which is terrible.
00:43:29 They're badly paced.
00:43:30 They should just make the episodes half as long.
00:43:34 They try.
00:43:35 15 minute episodes.
00:43:36 They try it.
00:43:37 They go fucking long.
00:43:38 The intros and outros.
00:43:40 And the recap.
00:43:41 It's crazy how long we can get on some shows.
00:43:44 It's insane.
00:43:45 15 minutes of new animation on a show
00:43:47 because most of it's recap and intros.
00:43:49 Crazy.
00:43:50 The intro is like a full three minutes long.
00:43:52 Then you have two minutes of fucking recap
00:43:54 and then like the outro is a full like four minutes
00:43:57 or something like that.
00:43:58 It's crazy.
00:43:59 They're saving as much time as possible.
00:44:01 So one piece is a weekly strip.
00:44:03 Is it still going weekly?
00:44:04 Is that just, it's a weekly strip?
00:44:06 They have an outro.
00:44:09 That's just crazy to me.
00:44:10 He takes breaks every time.
00:44:11 That's so much.
00:44:14 Oda is a little less consistent than he used to be,
00:44:17 but it's mostly every week.
00:44:24 He's got some good, what do you call it?
00:44:27 Some manga I think is good to read like weekly.
00:44:29 Some of it like trying to read as it comes out is torturous.
00:44:33 I really like Kaiji,
00:44:34 but I just have to like deliberately forget about it for a year
00:44:38 and then like catch up on it.
00:44:40 You know what I mean?
00:44:41 Hold on.
00:44:42 You mean ultimate survivor Kaiji?
00:44:43 Yeah.
00:44:44 Kaiji is still going.
00:44:45 Is that still going?
00:44:46 It's still going.
00:44:47 Are you joking?
00:44:48 No, no, no.
00:44:49 He's on this crazy arc right now.
00:44:50 It's like you don't even understand.
00:44:52 How long has it been going for?
00:44:54 Since the 90s.
00:44:55 The thing is, it's not like every week or anything.
00:44:58 That's why I was like,
00:44:59 one piece every week because like that's crazy to me
00:45:01 that you can be that consistent.
00:45:02 Kaiji is not every week.
00:45:03 I think it's either monthly now or actually I have no idea
00:45:05 what the schedule is.
00:45:06 I'm only catching like the English pages as their chapters
00:45:08 as they're translated.
00:45:09 So I don't really know the actual release date,
00:45:11 but yeah, it's still going.
00:45:12 It's literally still going.
00:45:14 Kaiji still having his little fun adventures.
00:45:16 I used to not even read the manga,
00:45:18 but just like knowing that.
00:45:19 Yeah.
00:45:20 His fun adventures.
00:45:21 The lighthearted, the lighthearted realm.
00:45:23 Getting his like ear cut on.
00:45:24 That is a Kaiji ultimate survivor.
00:45:25 Going in like slave jail underground.
00:45:29 See, it's so good though.
00:45:31 It's so good.
00:45:32 Do they, do they keep making the anime or do they?
00:45:35 No, the anime is stuck on,
00:45:37 we're never going to get a season three unfortunately.
00:45:39 I mean, at least that's my guess,
00:45:42 which is yeah, it is unfortunate because I really like,
00:45:44 but you know, it's one of those things for years,
00:45:46 I was like, when are we going to get season three?
00:45:47 When are we going to get season three?
00:45:48 Oh, I'll just follow the give up.
00:45:50 And then eventually I'll just read the fucking manga.
00:45:52 Fuck it, I'll read the manga.
00:45:53 Yeah, yeah.
00:45:54 Feel me.
00:45:55 It's like the attack on Titan effect.
00:45:57 It's like, well, it's gotta fucking read the manga, I guess.
00:46:00 It's extra hard when you know it's just like,
00:46:02 it's just there, it's waiting for you.
00:46:05 Like spoilers are like,
00:46:06 you could go spoil the whole show for yourself if you want it.
00:46:10 I could spoil the show by just, by reading it,
00:46:13 by going and reading it as intended.
00:46:16 Yeah.
00:46:17 And it's original format.
00:46:18 Exactly.
00:46:19 The ultimate spoiler.
00:46:20 I'm so excited for the next season of attack on Titan
00:46:22 to see all the discourse around that.
00:46:24 It's going to be very fun to re-experience it after the manga.
00:46:26 I'm going to be honest,
00:46:27 I watched the first season of attack on Titan
00:46:30 and I was like, oh, this is pretty interesting.
00:46:31 Oh, maybe I'll actually watch like the second season too,
00:46:33 but whatever.
00:46:34 The point is I dropped it and then I was like,
00:46:35 I didn't even hate it,
00:46:36 but I just sort of was like, whatever, I dropped it.
00:46:38 And now the only thing I hear about people is like bitching
00:46:40 about how horrible the ending was.
00:46:41 And now I'm like more curious.
00:46:43 So I think I might get back into it
00:46:44 just to hear people bitch about the ending.
00:46:46 I watched the first season and I liked it.
00:46:49 I thought it was cool.
00:46:50 But then, you know, there was a long wait,
00:46:53 I think for season two.
00:46:54 Yes, that too.
00:46:56 And then I was like, okay.
00:46:58 And people were like, oh, you can just read the manga.
00:47:00 And then I heard some of the stuff
00:47:02 that is later in the manga and I was like,
00:47:04 that sounds dumb.
00:47:06 I don't know.
00:47:07 I dropped it.
00:47:08 So I dropped the show and again, I didn't hate it,
00:47:10 but I was like, this kind of feels like The Walking Dead,
00:47:12 but like for weebs,
00:47:13 because main characters are constantly introduced
00:47:15 just to get killed off in a shocking way.
00:47:17 It's a little cringe.
00:47:18 So yeah, I sort of fell off.
00:47:20 But then I heard, it gets incredibly weird
00:47:22 and political later,
00:47:23 which is why everyone hates it.
00:47:24 The problems I had with it are not problems
00:47:27 that people bring up when they're like,
00:47:29 this is why it's a bad show.
00:47:30 You know what I mean?
00:47:31 So I'm curious as to how it got bad.
00:47:33 I read the whole manga.
00:47:34 Is that what people think the problem is?
00:47:37 Is that it went smart?
00:47:39 And it wasn't just people being like smart.
00:47:41 No, just heard a bunch of weird complaining
00:47:43 about the political aspects of it
00:47:45 and something about characters,
00:47:47 like Aaron's character got assassinated or something.
00:47:49 The main politics is genocide, bad.
00:47:52 And if people are complaining about that,
00:47:54 that's a red flag, in my opinion.
00:47:56 Yeah.
00:47:57 I've read the manga.
00:47:59 I've seen the whole show so far.
00:48:01 It's one of the few things I have actually caught up on.
00:48:04 I don't know.
00:48:06 If you've only seen the first season,
00:48:08 there's at least two more seasons of good animation,
00:48:10 but the good animators are no longer working on it
00:48:14 after they switched studios, which is a shame.
00:48:16 It's so fucking annoying, dude,
00:48:18 when it's like you watch a show, like one punch man,
00:48:20 you're like, like, shit, this is great animation,
00:48:22 and then the next to the next season.
00:48:24 Well, here's the thing, one punch man also had
00:48:26 the best scenes in one punch man season one
00:48:28 were done by the same animator who did all the best scenes
00:48:30 in Attack on Titan.
00:48:32 His name's Howie Fooly.
00:48:34 There was great animation, I remember.
00:48:36 Action, animation, God, he's a crazy man.
00:48:38 Attack on Titan's over, right?
00:48:40 Like the manga ended a while back,
00:48:42 but they just haven't been in a show.
00:48:44 The show is one more season coming in the manga.
00:48:46 Technically, it's part two of season four, I think.
00:48:49 They're cooling it?
00:48:51 I don't know why they do that.
00:48:53 You got to break the last season into two parts.
00:48:55 That's just like a time-owner tradition of milking.
00:48:57 They did that with season three, too.
00:48:59 There was season three part one, and then season three part two.
00:49:01 Oh, yeah.
00:49:03 That's dumb, just call it next season.
00:49:05 It should be actually season four,
00:49:07 and then season four should be called season five,
00:49:09 and then season four part two should be called season six.
00:49:11 That would make more sense to me.
00:49:13 They should go away with calling things season six.
00:49:15 Part six.
00:49:17 I don't see it being set in autumn
00:49:19 or winter or summer.
00:49:21 It just doesn't make any sense.
00:49:23 It is weird. Season is a weird term,
00:49:25 and they don't even use it in England, right?
00:49:27 Numbers.
00:49:29 They call it a series.
00:49:31 We had a series of a show or something.
00:49:33 Yeah, that's so confusing.
00:49:35 It's inconsistent. It's weird.
00:49:37 It's like shit that's made in England.
00:49:39 They say series,
00:49:41 and then everything is important.
00:49:43 It is inconsistent.
00:49:45 Well, yeah, most of the time,
00:49:47 but then other times it's like
00:49:49 they'll adopt the word season
00:49:51 for
00:49:53 a show made in Britain,
00:49:55 and other times they'll use series for a show
00:49:57 imported from other countries.
00:49:59 It just doesn't, it sucks.
00:50:01 Why does it have to be so confusing?
00:50:03 Just call it the show.
00:50:05 You're absolutely right. The season in Moniker makes
00:50:07 even less sense now that everything gets dumped in one day.
00:50:09 It's not even like it airs across the season anymore.
00:50:11 All the episodes are dumped in one day on Netflix.
00:50:13 Oh, that's why they were called season?
00:50:15 Yeah.
00:50:17 That's funny.
00:50:19 Seasonal anime or whatever comes out
00:50:21 during a season,
00:50:23 and it's like, oh, it's the winter set of shows.
00:50:25 It's the this or that.
00:50:27 I get it, but it really just doesn't
00:50:29 reflect reality at all
00:50:31 when you use season for everything,
00:50:33 regardless of when it comes out.
00:50:35 And I don't really have a problem with it.
00:50:37 The fact we use season to refer to a series of episodes
00:50:39 made in a time frame.
00:50:41 English, come on.
00:50:47 They used to have like,
00:50:49 there was a series
00:50:51 which means like
00:50:53 one after the other of like episodes
00:50:55 that could be watched in any order.
00:50:57 And then there's a serial
00:50:59 which is used to refer
00:51:01 to a show that has a narrative
00:51:03 that goes from one episode to the other.
00:51:05 You need to watch all of them, I think.
00:51:07 Either that, it's like one way or the other.
00:51:09 Like a series
00:51:11 show
00:51:13 is like, I don't know,
00:51:15 like a
00:51:17 Doug, and then a serial would be
00:51:19 Game of Thrones.
00:51:21 We call everything season.
00:51:23 I'm okay with season because it makes discussion easier
00:51:25 when you're like saying,
00:51:27 remember in season blood when this happened.
00:51:29 I'm just so used to it, I'll never not call things season.
00:51:31 Yeah.
00:51:33 It's one of those like
00:51:35 languages change and season now just means
00:51:37 that when it refers to a television show
00:51:39 or whatever.
00:51:41 But I don't care about Attack on Titan.
00:51:43 I just wanted to speak about something.
00:51:45 I just wanted to be pedantic.
00:51:47 Neva Diwali now though.
00:51:49 I'm the opposite.
00:51:51 I care a lot about Attack on Titan, but I didn't talk about it.
00:51:53 Hey, what about
00:51:55 this series?
00:51:57 Huh?
00:51:59 What do we think?
00:52:01 What do we think? It's a math joke.
00:52:03 That's like, googly eyes.
00:52:05 With an E and an A and an I
00:52:07 and a dash and an I and a dash and a one.
00:52:09 That's exactly it.
00:52:11 That's exactly what it is. Yes.
00:52:13 I'm glad you understood.
00:52:15 What does that mean, Mr. Say?
00:52:17 That's the summation.
00:52:19 That's the summation sign.
00:52:21 It's when you do a series
00:52:23 that you add up, that means
00:52:25 A starts with the I
00:52:27 and then it's the sum and it goes minus one.
00:52:29 Wow. Everybody laughs at this fucking nerd
00:52:31 for trying to tell us about math.
00:52:33 That's boring.
00:52:35 That's boring.
00:52:37 Remember when the female Titan screamed
00:52:39 and all the Titans ran up and started fighting?
00:52:41 That was cool.
00:52:43 Yeah, I dropped out of school
00:52:45 so I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
00:52:47 Ben got a degree in physics
00:52:49 or some worthless nonsense
00:52:51 that's not even real.
00:52:53 No, it wasn't worthless
00:52:55 because now when I
00:52:57 have Game Maker open
00:52:59 I can tell my little guy
00:53:01 to jump in an arc and I go,
00:53:03 okay, oh, square
00:53:05 and I'll make a fade out
00:53:07 and I make a fade out and I'll use a little
00:53:09 square root and I'll just say, okay, yeah,
00:53:11 that's a nice little gentle curve.
00:53:13 A nice little gentle curve for my little
00:53:15 video game character, man.
00:53:17 You should track down and email
00:53:19 some more professors.
00:53:21 And be like, this is what I did with my degree.
00:53:23 Look at the pony game I made.
00:53:27 No, I don't want to tell James
00:53:29 a joke about that.
00:53:31 He'd be ashamed.
00:53:33 But it is a cool skill
00:53:35 to be math knowledgeable
00:53:37 that you can put a formula into a thing
00:53:39 to make a pretty thing happen.
00:53:41 It actually is.
00:53:43 I wouldn't know the first thing about
00:53:45 making a cool arc. I would just need to look up
00:53:47 what to do.
00:53:49 The math that I learned was way more advanced.
00:53:51 The stuff that I use is like fucking
00:53:53 freshman year bullshit.
00:53:55 But for what it is,
00:53:57 it is useful to know about
00:53:59 the equations
00:54:01 for a parabolic arc
00:54:03 or whatever.
00:54:05 It's good and shit.
00:54:07 It's helpful.
00:54:09 If I'm ever in a situation
00:54:11 where I need to know the radius or the tangent,
00:54:13 I'd rather die.
00:54:15 I'd rather just be dead.
00:54:17 Sign! Cosine! Tangent!
00:54:19 You ever play
00:54:21 The World Ends With You?
00:54:23 No.
00:54:25 It's like The World Ends With Cosine.
00:54:27 It's that one guy that goes
00:54:29 Sign! Cosine! Tangent!
00:54:31 I was good at playing the new one.
00:54:33 He's the best guy.
00:54:35 Oh right, there's a new one.
00:54:37 The older one was awesome. The older one ruled.
00:54:39 I don't know. I haven't seen the new one.
00:54:41 I heard the switch port of the old one was really bad.
00:54:43 So I wasn't going to buy that. I was just going to buy the new one.
00:54:45 Why was it bad?
00:54:47 It's like a full 3D remake
00:54:49 and it just ruined the combat.
00:54:51 The combat doesn't work without the DS system
00:54:53 kind of thing.
00:54:55 I was skeptical about that.
00:54:57 I don't know.
00:54:59 I mean, the original one was made
00:55:01 the original one
00:55:03 was very specifically designed
00:55:05 for the DS.
00:55:07 So, you know,
00:55:09 I can understand how it's just totally fucked
00:55:11 if you try to play it on anything else.
00:55:13 It should have done a Wii U port
00:55:15 when they had the chance.
00:55:17 Genuine? Yeah.
00:55:19 Wii U was the perfect fucking console
00:55:21 for a World of Few sequel.
00:55:23 OK, the big DS.
00:55:25 Yeah, it was actually the perfect console
00:55:27 for like a lot of
00:55:29 types of games, but like
00:55:31 it died so,
00:55:33 and they didn't really use the touch screen.
00:55:35 World of Few is actually one of the coolest games
00:55:37 I've ever played.
00:55:39 It's actually like, it might be like
00:55:41 top 10 games that I remember
00:55:43 like the most fondly.
00:55:45 I love it.
00:55:47 That means a lot coming from noted media
00:55:49 in Saint.
00:55:51 I used to like things.
00:55:53 There was a time
00:55:55 when I liked video games
00:55:57 and at that time
00:55:59 World of Few was pretty up there.
00:56:01 I was like, yeah, pretty cool.
00:56:03 I've been on my list for a while,
00:56:05 but I have a friend who's like obsessed with Twi,
00:56:07 so I'm like, I gotta play it.
00:56:09 I'm gonna play it at some point. You know, it's got
00:56:11 what, the number of character designs?
00:56:13 How can you resist?
00:56:15 Yeah.
00:56:17 I thought
00:56:19 Twi was like an anime movie.
00:56:21 They made an anime of it recently.
00:56:23 Oh, is there an anime of it? I wouldn't know.
00:56:25 Yeah, I was gonna ask about that.
00:56:27 You might think it's like a visual novel
00:56:29 if you saw like screen shots of it,
00:56:31 but no, it has combat.
00:56:33 It has...
00:56:35 No, I thought this was like
00:56:37 a combination of like Jet Set Radio
00:56:39 and King of Hearts.
00:56:41 Aesthetically, that's not even, you know, that far off
00:56:43 of a descriptor, honestly.
00:56:45 Hearts just do show up in King of Hearts.
00:56:47 Right.
00:56:49 It looks weird as like a cartoon.
00:56:51 Yeah.
00:56:53 That guy is,
00:56:55 he's not pulling,
00:56:57 he's not putting that cup to his lips,
00:56:59 he's putting it to his nose,
00:57:01 and he's sniffing it very hard.
00:57:03 He doesn't have lips.
00:57:05 Yeah, he'd have to like pull his
00:57:07 thing down.
00:57:09 I had no idea that he pours directly into the scarf
00:57:11 and he's just like slurping it up and he's like dribbling
00:57:14 Yeah.
00:57:15 It looks a little stupid
00:57:17 in motion.
00:57:19 In the game, in like the limited
00:57:21 assets of the dialogue
00:57:23 of the game
00:57:25 and the characters moving around on the battlefield.
00:57:27 It looks great. It's beautiful.
00:57:29 It's a masterpiece.
00:57:31 Yeah, it seems like a really stylish game.
00:57:33 I believe you.
00:57:35 Speaking of stylish masterpieces,
00:57:37 I would use for it.
00:57:39 I got into Beth May Cry recently
00:57:41 who's just fucking awesome.
00:57:43 Everybody on Earth should play it.
00:57:45 I put those off for so long,
00:57:47 but I kept hearing Matthew Matosis
00:57:49 suck that series' dick and all these other people
00:57:51 that I respect.
00:57:53 In my mind, I like character action games.
00:57:55 That makes sense. That seems like a really cool genre.
00:57:57 Whenever I play them, I'm like,
00:57:59 I'm not instantly good at the game.
00:58:01 I suck and I'm like, this is bullshit.
00:58:03 But if you really...
00:58:05 I'm actually not a DMC expert.
00:58:07 I haven't even played five yet, which is very shameful.
00:58:09 And then I got through four as well at some point.
00:58:11 And yeah, they're really good series.
00:58:13 I mean, apart from two, obviously, but one in three
00:58:15 are great games and four was also fun.
00:58:17 Yeah, much like with Digimon,
00:58:19 much like with Digimon, I bounced off of
00:58:21 DMC part two.
00:58:23 My friend in high school was like the biggest DMC fan
00:58:25 and I was like, okay, okay, cool.
00:58:27 And then I decided to get two.
00:58:29 So unfortunate.
00:58:31 And I was like, well, this isn't very fun.
00:58:33 It's legitimately bad during my time with this game.
00:58:35 It sucks.
00:58:37 It's horrible.
00:58:39 There aren't even DMC fans that defend it.
00:58:41 There's not even a contingent like, oh, it's actually pretty good.
00:58:43 Everyone just, oh yeah, it sucks.
00:58:45 We all know it sucks. It's a piece of shit.
00:58:47 How weird that they could just do that?
00:58:51 They could just fuck one up real bad.
00:58:53 And it's just bad.
00:58:55 The fact that they were able to make another one at three
00:58:57 and then that one was actually amazing.
00:58:59 That was a big surprise.
00:59:01 Three was the best one.
00:59:03 Making a video game is hard.
00:59:05 They're like, all right, we've made one.
00:59:07 Let's make another one.
00:59:09 But let's do it a little differently.
00:59:11 It was the Dark Souls 2 thing with it.
00:59:13 And then they just made all of the wrong choices.
00:59:15 It was the Dark Souls 2 problem
00:59:17 of having a different team.
00:59:19 And then the guy who directed three
00:59:21 came in at the very end of development and tried to save it.
00:59:23 Where it's like, oh shit, you guys...
00:59:25 He came in all last day.
00:59:27 So how was that game you're doing?
00:59:29 There was a famous infamous story
00:59:31 where it was like the only thing they had done
00:59:33 was the Stinger attack.
00:59:35 That was the only useful thing they had done
00:59:37 at that point in development.
00:59:39 He had to start from scratch when he came in at the project.
00:59:41 Jesus.
00:59:43 My God.
00:59:45 Game development is hard though.
00:59:47 Why did they make it shitty?
00:59:49 Why did they choose to make it shitty?
00:59:51 It's complicated. It's hard.
00:59:53 Speak for yourself.
00:59:55 Speak for yourself.
00:59:57 I have been cranking up.
00:59:59 This week I have upgraded.
01:00:01 I have basically finished making Phantom's Revenge
01:00:03 beta version 3.
01:00:05 I have successfully added
01:00:07 weapon marriage and stock trading
01:00:09 to the game.
01:00:11 Better out of fishing game now.
01:00:13 Better out of fishing game now.
01:00:15 I think it's all this bullshit.
01:00:17 That's...
01:00:19 Seatall last episode asked if you could fish
01:00:21 and if there was fishing and farming
01:00:23 and I was like, oh, maybe.
01:00:25 No, no, I have to stop.
01:00:27 I have to stop.
01:00:29 Save that.
01:00:31 I think stock trading
01:00:33 is the perfect edition
01:00:35 and that's where I'm like, okay,
01:00:37 game's perfect now. Game's perfect.
01:00:39 Better out of star rank system
01:00:41 like Devil May Cry.
01:00:43 You know, I might
01:00:45 because the game does
01:00:47 sort of like judge you
01:00:49 at the end. The game gives you results
01:00:51 and you can sort of interpret them
01:00:53 in like a how did you do.
01:00:55 Have a bit crushed voice go cool,
01:00:57 huh?
01:00:59 Awesome.
01:01:01 I mean,
01:01:03 Phantom at will.
01:01:05 Not great.
01:01:07 There are circumstances
01:01:09 which will make Phantom
01:01:11 look different at the end.
01:01:13 You can make him cry. You can make Phantom cry
01:01:15 at the end if you are a bad person.
01:01:17 I always wish that if I took like 50 hours
01:01:19 to beat Metroid, that Samus
01:01:21 would like cry at the end and be like, how could you?
01:01:23 I was so bored running
01:01:25 backwards and forwards
01:01:27 between two places that I knew what to do
01:01:29 but someone was controlling me
01:01:31 making me do stupid shit.
01:01:33 This was the big
01:01:35 edition of version two. I'm not going to say
01:01:37 what it was but I added something
01:01:39 that would let you beat...
01:01:41 If you're bad at the game, it would let you beat it anyway
01:01:43 but if you beat it that way,
01:01:45 Phantom cries at the end
01:01:47 and you feel like a fucking monster
01:01:49 and you better go back and do it right
01:01:51 and do it right, you idiot.
01:01:53 I'm going to speedrun for that ending.
01:01:55 If it's faster, that's the only route people are going to speedrun, sorry.
01:01:57 That's true.
01:01:59 That's true. Kill the animals.
01:02:01 Well, you know.
01:02:03 Alright. It's actually not faster.
01:02:05 It's actually not faster. It's just easier.
01:02:07 Okay, that's fair.
01:02:09 I think it would actually be...
01:02:11 Interesting point.
01:02:13 I'm thinking about it. Yeah, I think it would actually be
01:02:15 faster to play it well
01:02:17 and not do that.
01:02:19 Well, you know, I thought of everything.
01:02:21 Don't worry.
01:02:23 Game's a masterpiece.
01:02:25 Yeah.
01:02:27 And those jump arcs.
01:02:29 Who, boy?
01:02:31 Parabolic AF.
01:02:33 I can't wait to see Jeff Keely on stage
01:02:35 next year at the Game Awards and he goes,
01:02:37 the best indie game goes to
01:02:39 Phantom's Revenge.
01:02:41 It is the best indie game.
01:02:43 Phantom's Revenge.
01:02:45 He sounds like that.
01:02:47 He was just like that.
01:02:49 He's the guy who hosted the Game Awards.
01:02:51 He was the Dorito Pope.
01:02:53 Okay, but there's got to be something
01:02:55 else to him than that, right?
01:02:57 Yeah, he was a...
01:02:59 He was a... Fuck, I forgot
01:03:01 what he did before. He was like a journalist.
01:03:03 He worked for
01:03:05 Game Trailer.
01:03:07 I don't think so.
01:03:09 He works for something. So one of those
01:03:11 Gamescom, Games Far,
01:03:13 Gamesweep, I don't know.
01:03:15 Alright, okay.
01:03:17 He's okay.
01:03:19 I don't hate him as much as I thought I should hate him.
01:03:23 He made Angry Joe look
01:03:25 like an idiot once
01:03:27 and that was pretty funny. So
01:03:29 Jeff Keely gets the zero approval.
01:03:31 That fucking face.
01:03:33 Oh, I was right.
01:03:35 There's this infamous interview with Angry Joe.
01:03:37 He fucking blew Angry Joe the fuck
01:03:39 out. He fucking...
01:03:41 Oh, yeah.
01:03:43 I think, wait.
01:03:45 Was that entirely
01:03:47 broadcast by Angry Joe to say
01:03:49 Jeff Keely fucking sucks.
01:03:51 Yeah, it was.
01:03:53 And then he just shows them talking
01:03:55 and Angry Joe was just being
01:03:57 a complete spaz.
01:03:59 I feel like I know what you're talking about,
01:04:01 but can you fill me in on
01:04:03 what that was?
01:04:05 It was an interview that Angry Joe recorded
01:04:07 with Jeff Keely at the Game Awards and he was
01:04:09 complaining about Jeff's
01:04:11 picks for each category and stuff.
01:04:13 And he was saying like, oh, you haven't even nominated
01:04:15 any MMOs for the RPG thing.
01:04:17 And he was like, Jeff Keely just shuts him down at every
01:04:19 single point and proves him wrong in every single one.
01:04:21 And because it's a video made by
01:04:23 Angry Joe, he like
01:04:25 pauses the video and then he comes on screen green screen
01:04:27 and he goes, see, he's fucking with me, even though
01:04:29 Jeff Keely's just completely proved him wrong.
01:04:31 It's one of the most hilarious videos.
01:04:33 Angry Joe's just screaming like
01:04:35 an idiot and he's completely wrong about
01:04:37 everything.
01:04:39 I mean, it sounds like
01:04:41 Angry Joe owned himself.
01:04:43 It was a legendary
01:04:45 cellphone on his part.
01:04:49 I just realized that
01:04:51 cellphone actually sounds exactly the same
01:04:53 as cellphone when you say it really fast.
01:04:55 Cellphone. Wow.
01:04:57 Men posting their L's.
01:04:59 That's why we just say phone makes you think.
01:05:01 We had to drop the cell.
01:05:03 It says a lot.
01:05:05 It says a lot about society. Perfect cellphone.
01:05:07 You know, I want to go back to
01:05:09 how
01:05:11 David Lynch called them
01:05:13 telephones, even though they were cellphones.
01:05:17 They're still telephones.
01:05:19 They are telephones.
01:05:21 Yeah, we should just go back to calling them that.
01:05:23 They're cello telephones.
01:05:25 You know,
01:05:27 as I was adding stock trading,
01:05:29 I was a bit sad because
01:05:31 I was adding stock trading and I was like,
01:05:33 okay, you're going to do stock trading
01:05:35 through your cell phone, right? Because that's how you do it
01:05:37 in Endless War.
01:05:39 You have a cell phone and you can do,
01:05:41 you can call it the remote stock exchange.
01:05:43 You call it your slime broker and you trade
01:05:45 stocks on the slime stock exchange.
01:05:47 So I wanted to make
01:05:49 the like command subcategory
01:05:51 exclamation point cell phone,
01:05:53 but it was just a little bit too long
01:05:55 and it was like, it like
01:05:57 stuck out a little bit further than like the menu
01:05:59 and I was like, if I change the menu,
01:06:01 I would have to like change every other
01:06:03 menu option. I would have to like,
01:06:05 I would have to move everything,
01:06:07 every subcategory option individually.
01:06:09 I have to move them. I was like, no,
01:06:11 no, it's boring.
01:06:13 That's dumb. I'm just going to shorten it to phone.
01:06:15 But I was like, but phone is lame.
01:06:17 It's not just a phone. It's a gel phone.
01:06:19 This is a piece of lore.
01:06:21 I made an artistic compromise
01:06:23 and I will never forgive myself.
01:06:25 Can you just do like gel-ph?
01:06:27 It's a cell phone.
01:06:29 Or JJ phone.
01:06:31 No, that's
01:06:33 those ideas suck.
01:06:35 This is why you guys are not
01:06:37 game guys.
01:06:39 Well, actually, actually you could
01:06:41 you could have made the font smaller.
01:06:43 Shut the fuck up.
01:06:45 You don't understand.
01:06:47 You don't understand anything.
01:06:49 Just change the text.
01:06:51 That would be a nightmare.
01:06:53 Imagine
01:06:55 imagine if one text option
01:06:57 is just a smaller font than all the other ones.
01:06:59 You would be just close your eyes.
01:07:01 Then I guarantee
01:07:03 close your eyes
01:07:05 does it almost
01:07:07 feel like nothing
01:07:09 changed at all.
01:07:11 You got to change the text.
01:07:15 Let me just say personally
01:07:17 I'm looking forward to this game
01:07:19 and almost as much as looking forward to just playing the game.
01:07:21 I'm looking forward to watching Ben
01:07:23 try to like have to
01:07:25 explain this game to people who don't know anything about it
01:07:27 and try to pitch them to play it when they're going to be
01:07:29 beyond confused.
01:07:31 There's a pony comic you got to read first
01:07:33 and it's related to Sonichu
01:07:35 but it's also like this and it's like that.
01:07:37 My plan
01:07:39 My plan is to
01:07:41 make the game funny
01:07:43 and approachable and cool so that people
01:07:45 will play it on their own and I won't have to explain it
01:07:47 and if they want to
01:07:49 they can follow up and be like
01:07:51 what's the comic this is linked to? Let me go check that out.
01:07:53 The whole thing was just a trick
01:07:55 to get people to read your old
01:07:57 pony comic.
01:07:59 I mean, sure.
01:08:01 Why not?
01:08:03 The whole thing was just a
01:08:05 trick to get more views on T-Bap.
01:08:07 T-Bap was struggling for years now
01:08:09 it wasn't getting views so we had to
01:08:11 put the word out there.
01:08:13 The thing I'm excited to see is Ben's discord trying to convince him
01:08:15 that the game is done while he's trying to add more shit.
01:08:17 I can't wait for that.
01:08:19 You were saying something last week about how
01:08:21 you've basically done the main game and you're just adding
01:08:23 this type of bullshit on top but I just want to go on
01:08:25 the record and say that's the most important shit is
01:08:27 the extraneous bullshit because
01:08:29 that's what really gives the game a soul.
01:08:31 You know what I mean?
01:08:33 Genuinely, genuinely, version 1
01:08:35 beta version 1 sucked
01:08:37 I realized I thought it was good
01:08:39 I thought it was great it was done
01:08:41 but then I was like okay
01:08:43 version 2 there's something I want to add
01:08:45 I added it and now I realize version 1
01:08:47 was garbage. Version 2 was the actual
01:08:49 complete version of the game. The game was not
01:08:51 complete.
01:08:53 Version 3
01:08:55 it didn't need weapon marriage
01:08:57 it didn't need stock trading
01:08:59 but I do think it is better for having them
01:09:01 and I think version 3 is
01:09:03 version 2 was essentially done.
01:09:05 Version 3 is just an improvement but now I'm like
01:09:07 okay it doesn't
01:09:09 it would not be that much improved but anymore
01:09:11 so I think I'm actually calling it
01:09:13 I'm actually calling it.
01:09:15 This is no more major addition
01:09:17 You can only add shit after it comes out
01:09:19 I really want to
01:09:21 I have
01:09:23 maybe you've heard me mention that maybe
01:09:25 in the future it would be funny to go back
01:09:27 and add in keg mode
01:09:29 that would be very silly
01:09:31 it would be funny
01:09:33 it would be a lot of work and probably
01:09:35 not worth it actually
01:09:37 I said it would be easy but it wouldn't be bad
01:09:39 you could make a bunch of sprites or shit
01:09:41 I know you could make it model them
01:09:43 or modify existing ones
01:09:45 but it would still be a lot of work
01:09:47 yeah, yeah
01:09:49 honestly I was thinking
01:09:51 I would want it to play differently
01:09:53 because keg would have to function
01:09:55 mechanically differently from phantom
01:09:57 because phantom
01:09:59 because phantom is a slime pony
01:10:01 and is immune to the electric attacks
01:10:03 of soniches
01:10:05 and it can only be defeated through the use of
01:10:07 bicarbonate soda water
01:10:09 keg would be
01:10:11 he would have no reaction
01:10:13 he would have no response at all to
01:10:15 water but he would be
01:10:17 easily defeated by sonichu
01:10:19 using some sort of move
01:10:21 for example thunderbolt or thunder
01:10:23 or voltackle or etc
01:10:25 etc
01:10:27 there would have to be something
01:10:29 and I thought it would be really funny if
01:10:31 what if keg has a gun
01:10:33 he's just like hey good thing I found this gun
01:10:35 outside and it goes in and
01:10:37 I don't know maybe it's like a speed
01:10:39 it's like
01:10:41 here it is, keg mode is this
01:10:43 instead of a
01:10:45 turn based rpg
01:10:47 with phantom
01:10:49 keg mode is typing of the dead
01:10:51 where he just gets to a new room
01:10:53 and he just has to type a word fast enough
01:10:55 so that he just shoots every sonichu
01:10:57 before they can shoot him and he's like
01:10:59 well okay next room
01:11:01 I love it but I'm biased
01:11:03 I love typing in the dead so I think that's hilarious
01:11:05 so that would just be
01:11:07 an entirely new game basically
01:11:09 just make a new game on top of your old game
01:11:11 just spend every year making a game
01:11:13 that's what a sequel is basically
01:11:15 that's what the virtual dlc is
01:11:17 and all the dev micro games
01:11:19 you'd be surprised how much a different playable character
01:11:21 can have to a game
01:11:27 I'm trying to think
01:11:29 I feel like
01:11:31 oh zero, zero for megaman x
01:11:33 when you could summon zero
01:11:35 in like megaman x3
01:11:37 I think
01:11:39 and you get a sword
01:11:41 oh
01:11:43 zero didn't even have a sword
01:11:45 in the original megaman x
01:11:47 like at no point in megaman x
01:11:49 did zero have a sword
01:11:51 but then like in every other game
01:11:53 yeah all he does is he
01:11:55 megafan I like the series but
01:11:57 I wouldn't have been able to tell you that
01:11:59 I'm a megafan
01:12:01 I forgot when
01:12:03 he got the sword was it in 2
01:12:05 I think it's in
01:12:07 in number 2
01:12:09 or like
01:12:11 I don't think you can play as him in 2
01:12:13 but you can play as him in 3
01:12:15 and he definitely has the sword in 3
01:12:17 I don't know if he has the sword in 2
01:12:19 but he definitely does not in 1
01:12:21 but it's funny because
01:12:23 him being the sword guy is sort of like
01:12:25 kind of his whole thing
01:12:27 that's the one thing people know about him
01:12:29 that's how I know him
01:12:31 he's a little cool he's a laser sword
01:12:33 it's cool
01:12:35 we'll talk about that later because it was cool
01:12:37 they were like well there's a cool guy
01:12:39 so we should give him something cool like a sword
01:12:41 from what I remember
01:12:43 the sword wasn't his main weapon until 4
01:12:45 in 3 he could still use the arm cannon
01:12:47 from what I remember
01:12:49 but then in 4 he
01:12:51 yeah
01:12:53 yeah you're right
01:12:55 in 3 he could charge
01:12:57 he still uses the buster
01:12:59 but like one of his charged moves
01:13:01 is like a sword slash
01:13:03 before he just stopped using the buster
01:13:05 that was after the
01:13:07 yeah
01:13:09 after the graphics change
01:13:11 yeah it went from
01:13:13 yeah it went from SNES to PS1
01:13:17 I hate the way that it looks
01:13:19 I hate the way that
01:13:21 those games look after the graphical
01:13:23 change after x3
01:13:25 I just think it's so much worse
01:13:27 why?
01:13:29 it's like 2
01:13:31 rights are like too
01:13:33 big
01:13:35 well they're not bigger but like
01:13:37 they're more detailed and like
01:13:39 I don't know they're too detailed
01:13:41 I hate it
01:13:43 I really really hate
01:13:45 the way that x4 and on look
01:13:47 I think that the game looks perfect in the x style
01:13:49 and it
01:13:51 it was made worse
01:13:53 by being made better
01:13:55 by the enhanced fidelity
01:13:57 this is another one of those pokemon moving situations
01:13:59 you don't really articulate what you don't like about it
01:14:01 kinda
01:14:03 kinda only mega man was great
01:14:05 when it made it look 3d
01:14:07 because everybody likes mega man legends
01:14:09 like I just said I'm not a huge mega man
01:14:11 lore expert but I sort of know what you mean
01:14:13 I actually have not played
01:14:15 that much legends
01:14:17 but it looks awesome
01:14:19 everybody likes how it looks including me
01:14:21 I love low poly 3d mega man
01:14:23 yeah those games look dope as fuck
01:14:25 what about the 3dx games
01:14:27 it's aced really well
01:14:29 there's one of the x games
01:14:31 I think it's like x6 or 7
01:14:33 you actually have like playable 3d sections
01:14:35 it's like a hallway
01:14:37 it's really bad
01:14:39 I don't know I never played it
01:14:41 I remember hearing people bitch about like x6
01:14:43 those games apparently get kinda bad
01:14:45 but again I'm not speaking from first hand experience
01:14:47 just from watching youtube videos essays about
01:14:49 this is why mega man games get bad at the end
01:14:51 I mean in the mega man
01:14:53 in the mega man zero games
01:14:55 I guess he's still
01:14:57 I mean his sword is his most
01:14:59 iconic weapon but it's not
01:15:01 he is equally able
01:15:03 I mean he has all kinds of
01:15:05 he has a whole arsenal he has a gun
01:15:07 he has a sword he has this boomerang shield
01:15:09 he's got the like arm jabby things
01:15:11 he's got the like extendos spear
01:15:13 I fucking
01:15:15 zero
01:15:17 mega man zero
01:15:19 okay he's got all
01:15:21 kind of like the whole oh man and then
01:15:23 I think it's is it in Z4
01:15:25 is it in 04 that he has the glove
01:15:27 that he can like rip
01:15:29 like weapons out of other enemies
01:15:31 hands and like use them
01:15:33 we're fucking amazing
01:15:35 genius the greatest game ever made
01:15:37 yeah but he doesn't have
01:15:39 a stock market simulation so I mean
01:15:41 how good is it really
01:15:43 no he can't trade stocks on his gel phone
01:15:45 sure he's got all these weapons
01:15:47 he can't marry a single one of them
01:15:49 so what's even the point
01:15:51 I just want to give a shout out to Cruelty Squad
01:15:53 for being another game with an in-game stock
01:15:55 market where you can just like buy stocks
01:15:57 in the middle of a mission
01:15:59 but you know you really need to add to your game
01:16:01 to make it stand head and shoulders above
01:16:03 you need to add like a credit card churning system
01:16:05 you know
01:16:07 you already gamified it
01:16:09 you know how it's fun you know how to do it
01:16:11 I have not
01:16:13 I have not gotten around to playing Cruelty Squad
01:16:15 a lot of people have mentioned like
01:16:17 Cruelty Squad is very endless war
01:16:19 and it's it is in so many levels because
01:16:21 like one it's got like it's like slime aesthetic
01:16:23 and two it's like all about
01:16:25 like a hyper capitalist like corporate
01:16:27 nightmare world which is thematically
01:16:29 like so endless war is also
01:16:31 it's just like it's a little
01:16:33 it's a little less in your face about it
01:16:35 and it's like it really
01:16:37 it really is I could see people
01:16:39 I could see someone maybe they find
01:16:41 they stumble upon Phantom's revenge they play it
01:16:43 they realize like there's stocks in it and like they think like
01:16:45 is this like
01:16:47 is this like a Cruelty Squad spinoff
01:16:49 it's talking about slime and you can trade stocks
01:16:51 don't worry I could genuinely see someone
01:16:53 there's no ponies in Cruelty Squad
01:16:55 people won't get confused
01:16:57 guess what
01:16:59 I just found out Attack on Titan season 4
01:17:01 part 2 is airing today
01:17:03 the first episode
01:17:05 timing though
01:17:07 if only this went up today so the people
01:17:09 if you're listening to this now you missed it
01:17:11 if you didn't watch it I mean go watch the first episode
01:17:13 it's too late
01:17:15 you can't watch it live you can't watch it the day it came out
01:17:17 unless you already did
01:17:19 go watch episode 2 in a few days
01:17:21 yeah exactly
01:17:23 Simsie's lying to me

01:17:27 it's fine there's
01:17:29 wait I'm gonna grab a drink
01:17:31 I'm gonna grab a sparkling water I'll be back in one
01:17:33 second

01:17:37 and he will never know
01:17:39 we can listen to the episode back and be like
01:17:41 better listen to that part I wasn't there for
01:17:43 you think he's gonna do that 0% chance
01:17:45 I mean we can talk shit about Ben to his face
01:17:47 yeah but
01:17:49 actually right it is funnier to do it that way
01:17:51 let's just okay everyone hold your Ben shit on
01:17:53 until he gets back
01:17:55 I know it's hard to resist
01:17:57 he's really smelly he's just generally quite a smelly
01:17:59 person don't like him
01:18:01 you never sniffed him
01:18:03 that's what you think
01:18:05 you gotta have receipts if you want to destroy Ben's
01:18:07 I can tell he's smelly because I opened up my package
01:18:09 of the vapour
01:18:11 it just reeks
01:18:13 there's vapour in there
01:18:15 it's a bunch of vapour I open the box it's like a big cloud
01:18:17 comes out
01:18:19 a big vape cloud
01:18:21 and it says ha ha fuck you
01:18:23 and it dissipates
01:18:25 my copy of fucking
01:18:27 Road to Radcon
01:18:29 fucking reek I know he pissed on it
01:18:31 I know he did I know he doesn't like me I know he pissed on
01:18:33 my copy of Road to Radcon just to piss me off
01:18:35 he would never piss you off
01:18:37 let it dry out
01:18:41 it's all yellow
01:18:43 oh yeah I was gonna ask him about the
01:18:45 cleave and the weeb stuff
01:18:47 but I guess I will when he gets back
01:18:49 overall
01:18:51 I gotta say I'm glad I never bothered
01:18:53 being like Ben
01:18:55 you gotta chill out with your like tricksy hate
01:18:57 because it led us here it led us to this moment
01:18:59 it all worked out in the end
01:19:01 all the people are like trying to get him to calm down
01:19:03 calm down
01:19:05 you were anti-progress
01:19:07 you were gonna stand in the way of this
01:19:09 it's like an objective fact
01:19:11 that his hatred of tricksy has caused more
01:19:13 good in the world than bad
01:19:15 it is like some weird Dark Souls thing
01:19:17 where it's like fueling him
01:19:19 to keep going even though he's definitely
01:19:21 hollow at this point
01:19:23 I'm gonna buy a cleave and the weeb blu-ray
01:19:25 and I'm gonna
01:19:27 pledge an equal amount to Jesse's
01:19:29 Patreon that month
01:19:31 but not to tricksy
01:19:33 tricksy gets nothing
01:19:35 who's gonna be the first viewer
01:19:37 to buy the cleave and the weeb and then like
01:19:39 take it to a live yig show
01:19:41 and get it signed
01:19:43 oh god
01:19:45 he's gonna be the first viewer to
01:19:47 sign the
01:19:49 back of the box
01:19:51 it's a fat shit on tricksy
01:19:53 on the back of the box
01:19:55 there are live yig shows
01:19:57 I don't even think that's a thing anymore
01:19:59 it wasn't like it was a thing
01:20:01 there were
01:20:03 there was a techie
01:20:05 there was like one or two
01:20:07 one that was run by Wiley
01:20:09 one that they just like came into
01:20:11 at the end and then like another one
01:20:13 that's exactly what I was thinking
01:20:15 Riley Coyote
01:20:17 I can just imagine those
01:20:19 going like a
01:20:21 low taxes party
01:20:23 at his office
01:20:25 where only one person showed up and he was on the couch
01:20:27 passed out
01:20:29 oh yeah I should probably
01:20:31 I was gonna at some point take a moment to shill
01:20:33 my new video that I did
01:20:35 with my pal Bedhead Bernie
01:20:37 yeah I wanted to talk about that too
01:20:39 that was my favorite part
01:20:41 it's a funny moment
01:20:43 I knew a lot about
01:20:45 the history of SA
01:20:47 but that was one thing I didn't know about
01:20:49 it's real
01:20:51 internet boomer hours over here
01:20:53 trying to educate people about internet history
01:20:55 which is one of those things where it's like intellectually
01:20:57 like is internet history like important
01:20:59 no not really
01:21:01 but like at the same time
01:21:03 like I kind of think it is I don't really know how to explain it
01:21:05 and like it's
01:21:07 and it's
01:21:09 it's um
01:21:11 it's nice
01:21:13 I wouldn't say it's important but like so much of what we enjoy
01:21:15 it's easy for that stuff to get lost at time
01:21:17 you know like a lot of contemporary
01:21:19 like tweets just tweets just like things
01:21:21 like news articles with sight from around
01:21:23 you know
01:21:25 low taxes death and stuff like
01:21:27 those tweets are just deleted and like those news articles have like broken links
01:21:29 like internet history is just very
01:21:31 easy people just assume someone else
01:21:33 to like document it and archive it but
01:21:35 you know it doesn't really happen
01:21:37 are we talking about um
01:21:39 the Bernie vids low tax
01:21:41 I mentioned I was shilling my
01:21:43 low tax video that I had
01:21:45 worked on with my pal Bernie
01:21:47 yeah I saw that
01:21:49 I started I saw Bernie
01:21:51 tweet it and I started it and then I was like
01:21:53 oh hey it's cyber shell is in this
01:21:55 neat indeed indeed
01:21:57 um yeah we wrote it and researched
01:21:59 it together but uh he did
01:22:01 oh did you yeah yeah we basically made it
01:22:03 together but he edited and
01:22:05 voiced it because he just better edit
01:22:07 anything and I also didn't want to do it
01:22:09 it's amazing but uh yeah we basically
01:22:11 made it together there is a lot of people like
01:22:13 if you let's you watch to the end and also don't
01:22:15 or read the description then you probably
01:22:17 like a lot of people like oh I'm glad he got cyber shell for
01:22:19 a voice cameo and I'm like I do I did a lot
01:22:21 more than a voice cameo it's okay
01:22:23 that's what I thought yeah I thought you were just
01:22:25 a voice cameo no there's a lot of there are a lot of just
01:22:27 voice cameos so it's a little like I get why
01:22:29 people are like that like I really don't care
01:22:31 it's just one of those situations where I just wanted to make a good video
01:22:33 I didn't like I didn't care so much about
01:22:35 I hope it gets x amount of like views like I
01:22:37 want people to see it but like it's just like
01:22:39 I'm just happy that it's done
01:22:41 the video for us do people
01:22:43 even read the video descriptions anymore
01:22:45 because it didn't say that like you wrote it
01:22:47 nobody nobody read the video description
01:22:49 no answer no nobody
01:22:51 read the video of course not damn
01:22:53 I guess I'm the only one you're right
01:22:55 you're the last remaining video description
01:22:57 reader out there
01:22:59 yeah you're right
01:23:01 I'm the last person who exists to read some
01:23:03 about like internet
01:23:05 archiving where you were
01:23:07 saying somebody
01:23:09 asked in a voicemail like I think
01:23:11 a week or two ago
01:23:13 about
01:23:15 the digi clips
01:23:19 the digi clip stuff it was
01:23:21 the archives are just gone
01:23:23 like those forums have been deleted
01:23:25 and like all the fallout
01:23:27 of the whole something awful raid
01:23:29 on the real digimon believers forums
01:23:31 a lot of it just doesn't exist anymore
01:23:33 and it's sad because
01:23:35 a lot of funny a lot of funny shit went down there
01:23:37 and yeah a lot of
01:23:39 it is just gone
01:23:41 there's a lot of funny shit from like 2015
01:23:43 that's like gone forever let alone
01:23:45 trying to do research on like websites
01:23:47 from like 2003 thank god
01:23:49 for like archive.org and the way back machine
01:23:51 you can't even imagine how barren
01:23:53 and empty the internet would seem if just like it was
01:23:55 constantly like all these major sites
01:23:57 just gone forever you know what I mean
01:23:59 I mean I like lost media as much as the next guy
01:24:01 because I just like think it's interesting
01:24:03 like a million people could have seen this
01:24:05 but like zero remaining copies exist
01:24:07 you know what I mean it's just something weird about that
01:24:09 right but if it's truly
01:24:11 lost like gone forever then there's
01:24:13 nothing interesting about that because
01:24:15 like well what do we there's nothing
01:24:17 even frustrating
01:24:19 yeah I was
01:24:21 going to say if I could go back in time
01:24:23 I would have invested like millions of more
01:24:25 dollars in the internet archive because
01:24:27 like they were really ahead of their time that
01:24:29 shit started like in the late 90s like
01:24:31 he like knew how
01:24:33 important the internet was going to be become
01:24:35 the guy who started it
01:24:37 just like Hideo Kojima
01:24:39 that's what Metal Gear Solid 2 is
01:24:41 I love the part of Metal Gear Solid 2
01:24:43 where Raiden turns the camera and he goes
01:24:45 please just archive the things on the internet
01:24:47 and don't believe everything you read
01:24:49 I need my reuploads
01:24:51 of Digi Bros videos
01:24:53 don't delete your save files
01:24:55 I like the part where Raiden is like
01:24:57 chief
01:24:59 I need
01:25:01 I need a download and chief
01:25:03 is like no you can't have it
01:25:05 because I've put it on the blockchain
01:25:07 and it's the web 3.0
01:25:09 is the future
01:25:11 this internet shit these memes of today
01:25:13 are stupid
01:25:15 bitcoin
01:25:17 Raiden you didn't invest in bitcoin
01:25:19 I can't verify your hash I'm going to have to sell
01:25:21 your NFT
01:25:23 your NFTs end here Colonel
01:25:27 what's really interesting is that Metal Gear
01:25:29 was like one of the first places to use
01:25:31 the actual definition of the word meme
01:25:33 I am aware
01:25:35 before memes actually became
01:25:37 it is funny that meme
01:25:39 is just like a Richard
01:25:41 first of all it's weird that Richard Dawkins
01:25:43 of all people is the guy that
01:25:45 I think he coined it and it's just a gene
01:25:47 but with information
01:25:49 it's just a medic transfer of information
01:25:51 that's all it means
01:25:53 he invented the word
01:25:55 just like Shakespeare he just made up a word
01:25:57 and everyone was like okay
01:25:59 it's like I don't know
01:26:01 I understand English is an evolving language
01:26:03 and people make up words all the time
01:26:05 but in more of a slang way
01:26:07 and that sort of just becomes normalized
01:26:09 where it feels weird to be like this is going to be a real word I'm making right now
01:26:11 and it's going to go in dictionaries and stuff
01:26:13 I don't think he realized people were going to use it
01:26:15 I just quiz it
01:26:17 that way
01:26:19 yeah he probably didn't
01:26:21 he probably didn't expect it
01:26:23 to enter the lexicon
01:26:25 right
01:26:27 how could he have
01:26:29 he was describing what I'm sure he considered
01:26:31 a very hyper
01:26:33 a very specific type of information transfer
01:26:35 whereas the average person you say meme
01:26:37 and they're like oh you mean an image macro
01:26:39 it's like yeah that's what I meant
01:26:41 do you mean a trick tool
01:26:43 come to mean something else
01:26:45 you know I don't know
01:26:47 if any of you other guys were on my team
01:26:49 but they used to call them fads on there
01:26:51 yes I remember before a meme was widespread
01:26:53 people calling internet memes fads
01:26:55 that's a factoid
01:26:57 I don't even remember that
01:26:59 I remember that from Game Facts
01:27:01 more than YTMND
01:27:03 yeah
01:27:05 hmm
01:27:07 I knew what the word fad meant
01:27:09 but I never heard anyone use it
01:27:11 about like a specific image
01:27:13 or a phrase or anything
01:27:15 hmm maybe
01:27:17 I mean
01:27:19 I wasn't on YTMND
01:27:21 and I wasn't even really on Game Facts that much
01:27:23 I was on 4chan
01:27:25 I wasn't really on 4chan
01:27:27 really on 4chan until college
01:27:31 I was on Game Facts but I got
01:27:33 banned based
01:27:35 did I tell it
01:27:37 have I mentioned that a lot of my old roommates
01:27:39 that I was living with until recently
01:27:41 were people from a
01:27:43 forum called
01:27:45 oh fuck it was called
01:27:49 the TLDR
01:27:51 the forum was called the TLDR and it was where
01:27:53 people that were banned from the world of warcraft
01:27:55 the forum
01:27:57 would congregate
01:27:59 and they had lore
01:28:01 they had lore like Gabe Newell
01:28:03 posted one time on their forum
01:28:05 one time and that was like a big
01:28:07 and then one of the mods banned him
01:28:09 was Gabe Newell banned from World of Warcraft
01:28:11 no
01:28:13 I don't think so
01:28:15 but he was banned from the TLDR
01:28:17 which was
01:28:19 that was like a cataclysmic event
01:28:21 I think in their history
01:28:23 does it still exist
01:28:25 is what you mean like they're still
01:28:27 actively posting on there
01:28:29 I believe the forum does
01:28:31 still exist but I think it has mostly
01:28:33 become like a discord
01:28:35 I was gonna say almost every fucking forum
01:28:37 has just gotten evaporated
01:28:39 into discords and stuff
01:28:41 and social media in general
01:28:43 when I went back to look at
01:28:45 when I went back to look at
01:28:47 the Gaming Steve forums
01:28:49 I think I mentioned this a few months ago
01:28:51 I just went back to look at Gaming Steve
01:28:53 because I used to go there
01:28:55 when I was waiting for Will Wright's spore to come out
01:28:57 I would go there to check up on the latest
01:28:59 spore, yeah, to check up on the latest spore news
01:29:01 I remember the spore hype
01:29:03 dudes
01:29:05 that was like your first
01:29:07 your first youtube videos that are still up
01:29:09 yeah I have some spore creature creator videos
01:29:11 I remember the creature creator came out
01:29:13 and everyone was like oh this is so pog
01:29:15 the game's gonna be even better
01:29:17 I talked about that shit for years
01:29:19 I annoyed my girlfriend
01:29:21 in college by talking too much
01:29:23 about it
01:29:25 and then it came out
01:29:27 and uh
01:29:29 oops
01:29:31 but um
01:29:33 I went back to check those forums
01:29:35 and there was like one guy
01:29:37 there was like one guy
01:29:39 still posting threads
01:29:41 like fairly often
01:29:43 just being like hey guys I played this new game
01:29:45 I thought it was pretty good
01:29:47 this part annoyed me
01:29:49 which is can't let it go
01:29:51 he can't move on to the afterlife
01:29:53 yeah and he
01:29:55 he would just make some threads
01:29:57 every now and then and then like
01:29:59 I was just looking at all these threads he was making
01:30:01 and one guy was like hey man
01:30:03 we're all on discord now
01:30:05 you should join the discord and he's like
01:30:07 no fucking discord
01:30:09 discord's for groomers
01:30:11 fuck that shit
01:30:13 based one forum poster guy
01:30:15 he's literally like the guys in World War 2
01:30:17 who didn't realize the war was over and kept fighting
01:30:19 for like years after
01:30:21 the guy's trying to populate forums
01:30:23 still after the war has been lost
01:30:25 to discord
01:30:27 what video did I see about that one
01:30:29 about that one guy
01:30:31 that one like Vietnam
01:30:33 they think Japanese guy was like living on like
01:30:35 a jungle or something and
01:30:37 that's such a weird story but like yeah it's crazy
01:30:41 weren't there like multiple guys
01:30:43 surprised that there were at least a couple
01:30:45 I saw a video about one specific guy
01:30:47 it might have been an atrocity guy
01:30:49 video or uh
01:30:51 I don't remember what channel it was on
01:30:53 I don't know but yeah there's at least one
01:30:55 sounds like the kind of thing they'd cover on that channel
01:30:57 yeah
01:31:01 it sucks you should be able to have a question
01:31:03 and you could google it
01:31:05 but now it's like oh you want to know the answer to the
01:31:07 subscure game thing you have to join our discord
01:31:09 yeah exactly
01:31:11 oh
01:31:13 it's you got to join our discord
01:31:15 it's just it's just the
01:31:17 the
01:31:19 large discords feel like
01:31:21 you're walking around in a city
01:31:23 and everybody's walking past you
01:31:25 and it's like impossible to start a conversation
01:31:27 and it just doesn't
01:31:29 yeah it's too
01:31:31 it's also like really
01:31:33 it's really inconvenient to find information
01:31:35 how I feel about like a twitch chat once it gets too big
01:31:37 it's just it's it's unusable
01:31:39 I
01:31:41 like
01:31:43 like the the thread thing
01:31:45 is like a conversation about a specific
01:31:47 theory
01:31:49 you click on the topic you click on the thread and you read about
01:31:51 but like in a discord
01:31:53 chat
01:31:55 nobody is like
01:31:57 there's there's a lot less
01:31:59 um I guess strict
01:32:01 rules implored
01:32:03 in in in discords to keep things
01:32:05 on topic
01:32:07 but it just
01:32:09 I don't know it's just a completely
01:32:11 different feeling and it's sort of
01:32:13 to if it gets
01:32:15 to a certain size that discord is completely
01:32:17 unusable for me I have to just
01:32:19 mute it completely
01:32:21 I like lots of individual threads lots of
01:32:23 smaller conversations you can just go pick
01:32:25 and choose and participate in versus one like
01:32:27 giant uninterrupted
01:32:29 stream like I don't know it's it's you
01:32:31 got to find a discord like that's the right size
01:32:33 but then it's like yeah it's like some goldilocks
01:32:35 share it's either way too big way too fast
01:32:37 or you join discord and it's like
01:32:39 three messages a day type situation
01:32:43 I like I like discord
01:32:45 but yeah I do I do think it is a bit
01:32:47 sad that yeah it has
01:32:49 largely displaced forums
01:32:51 I did used to like
01:32:53 forums sometimes
01:32:55 and my experience
01:32:57 most of the forums I was on were kind of like
01:32:59 dead for like a couple years
01:33:01 and then discord sort of revived the community
01:33:03 that was more the experience I had
01:33:05 I don't want to be fully anti discord
01:33:07 I'm sure it has plenty of good things like just
01:33:09 intellectually like they do have a chat program
01:33:11 like there's nothing wrong with that you know
01:33:13 but I don't know
01:33:15 the pivot animation community was pretty
01:33:17 dead before discord revived it
01:33:19 it's it's just it's just
01:33:21 on on many that's actually
01:33:23 a good point there's probably a lot of communities that
01:33:25 can't maybe we're blaming
01:33:27 the wrong maybe we're blaming the wrong thing
01:33:29 maybe it's not yeah this discord
01:33:31 the move to discord might be like a symptom
01:33:33 more than like a you know
01:33:35 a root cause it is um
01:33:37 it is
01:33:39 it's not that I care about
01:33:41 forums more it's just that discord
01:33:43 sucks and I don't like it
01:33:45 it doesn't it doesn't like
01:33:47 it's just unwieldy I can't
01:33:49 get into anything
01:33:51 I can't make new friends on discord so it just
01:33:53 doesn't feel like I can't make new friends period but uh
01:33:55 that's
01:33:57 that's um another another topic
01:33:59 uh
01:34:01 I didn't care that much about forums either but the
01:34:03 the
01:34:05 problem is that everything online is like owned by
01:34:07 the same three corporations
01:34:09 yeah that's kind of what I was about
01:34:11 to say it sort of feels like another
01:34:13 step god
01:34:15 I mean I I guess we're I guess we're going
01:34:17 to the web 3.0 now which is even worse
01:34:19 somehow it works the web 2.0
01:34:21 well yeah it feels like another step
01:34:23 in the web 2.0
01:34:25 of like no no one
01:34:27 no like individual websites like
01:34:29 every what everything is on like a few big
01:34:31 platforms everything is on youtube or on
01:34:33 facebook or on discord or
01:34:35 yeah everything is agglomerated right
01:34:37 one yeah that's exactly
01:34:39 it's not that I specifically miss forums
01:34:41 and like if we all just went back to forums
01:34:43 the internet would be fixed it's just like
01:34:45 forums are emblematic of the old internet
01:34:47 which I miss as a whole
01:34:49 a lot more than I miss specifically for forums
01:34:51 in general we're just a den of like
01:34:53 the leadest pricks and you know a bunch of assholes
01:34:55 circle jerking over power
01:34:57 I mean I guess there's plenty of that on discord too
01:34:59 but it's not the forums for this
01:35:01 holy magical place trust me
01:35:03 yeah yeah
01:35:05 a lot of discords
01:35:07 I feel
01:35:09 totally invisible and a
01:35:11 giant discord but on a forum
01:35:13 I feel like you can start something
01:35:15 and then somebody can call you an idiot
01:35:17 a lot of discords are dominated by regulars
01:35:19 trying to break into a new group of people
01:35:21 like as a new member is very
01:35:23 hard because it's just the two
01:35:25 same group of people talking to each other
01:35:27 and just ignoring all the new people that join
01:35:29 which is a big issue I think
01:35:31 that's just a trend that I've noticed that is strange
01:35:33 yeah
01:35:35 I mean forums are like that too though
01:35:37 you would have your big posters
01:35:39 there were some
01:35:41 yeah for sure that could have been hard to like
01:35:43 you know
01:35:45 dude post count clout was like a big thing
01:35:47 I think
01:35:49 that was just as much of a problem
01:35:51 on forums
01:35:53 if you're a newbie
01:35:55 nobody wants to talk to you
01:35:57 and the threads are
01:35:59 dominated by the
01:36:01 people with lots of posts
01:36:03 on something awful in particular
01:36:05 there was a very big emphasis on forum etiquette
01:36:07 and lurking before posting
01:36:09 if you pay $10 for an account
01:36:11 and you make some posts
01:36:13 it's a lower case and you use
01:36:15 you instead of typing out the full word you
01:36:17 instantly you band off the forum
01:36:19 jeez
01:36:21 see I'm genuinely too young
01:36:23 and too normy to have ever used forums
01:36:25 in like any extent the only times I've looked
01:36:27 at forums is just like looking up
01:36:29 how to fix my computer and stuff and seeing posts from like
01:36:31 2002
01:36:33 well before discord existed
01:36:35 that's where everyone was hanging out
01:36:37 I was on the dark team
01:36:39 in forums for a pivot animation
01:36:41 like all the fucking time
01:36:43 in like 2009 to 2011
01:36:45 that community was pretty great
01:36:47 it was all for animators
01:36:49 and if you were a good animator
01:36:51 like you would get noticed like instantly
01:36:53 and you'd get your
01:36:55 animations posted into like the high quality
01:36:57 sections of the website
01:36:59 which was pretty cool
01:37:01 they had a ranking system
01:37:03 there's beginners, intermediates, veterans
01:37:05 and elites and I moved all the way up
01:37:07 to like the 10 people
01:37:09 who are in the elite zone
01:37:11 doing that shit
01:37:13 the ranking system
01:37:15 was very
01:37:17 controversial later on
01:37:19 because how dare you
01:37:21 rank people's artistic ability
01:37:23 or something
01:37:25 I hope you put that on your resume
01:37:27 I was elite on this forum
01:37:29 on the dark demon forum
01:37:31 on the fucking dark demon
01:37:33 there was one guy
01:37:35 who had like 30,000 posts
01:37:37 his name was Skype and I don't know how the fuck
01:37:39 he managed that
01:37:41 that was a post count of everyone else
01:37:43 some people were just forums
01:37:45 they just spend all their time on forums
01:37:47 and I feel like those people in particular
01:37:49 had a hard transition to discourse
01:37:51 well I mean
01:37:53 how many fucking tweets have I made
01:37:55 since starting my account
01:37:57 too many
01:37:59 is there a counter?
01:38:01 there used to be
01:38:03 I don't think it's public anymore
01:38:05 but there's probably still a way to check
01:38:07 it might be
01:38:09 you've made 17.3k tweets
01:38:11 Ben
01:38:13 I have?
01:38:15 wow, every single one a gem
01:38:17 worth the
01:38:19 17k
01:38:21 wow
01:38:23 I mean my account is pretty old
01:38:25 my account is like 7 or 8 or 9 years old
01:38:29 oh yeah
01:38:31 I'm liking that pinned tweet
01:38:33 while you were in the bathroom we had a brief discussion
01:38:35 about the plebe and the weeb
01:38:37 I'm sad I missed the announcement
01:38:39 it was very funny
01:38:41 all the people
01:38:43 trying to talk you down
01:38:45 you got to stop being so deranged
01:38:47 with your Trixie hate
01:38:49 it all led to this, it was all worth it
01:38:51 yeah
01:38:53 I kind of thought
01:38:55 this is building
01:38:57 it's going to be hard to top this
01:38:59 just going back to shitting on Trixie
01:39:01 in a few snipes tweets
01:39:03 I'm not saying you're not allowed to do it
01:39:05 it's going to be hard to top this
01:39:07 I've been
01:39:09 I've been gloating a little bit
01:39:11 I've been trying to gloat a little bit on Twitter
01:39:13 and they just are
01:39:15 the cowards are simply pretending
01:39:17 they don't notice
01:39:19 they pretend they do not see
01:39:21 I know that they know
01:39:23 I know they're seeing the ads
01:39:25 you made a tweet to this effect
01:39:27 you got Trixie in a bind
01:39:29 she just can't acknowledge it
01:39:31 there's no win scenario for her
01:39:33 she looks so bad
01:39:35 she looks so stupid
01:39:37 there's nothing she can say
01:39:39 to be like
01:39:41 Ben's bullying me about this
01:39:43 there's no angle
01:39:45 that she can take
01:39:47 I'm sure she's told Riley
01:39:49 Riley don't answer
01:39:51 just ignore it
01:39:53 don't acknowledge it
01:39:55 they at least want the complimentary free one
01:39:57 they want
01:39:59 I'm trying to extend the olive branch
01:40:01 I'll give Riley one too
01:40:03 he can have one
01:40:05 I'll give one for Bird
01:40:07 not only is the Radcon
01:40:09 for Kickstarter finally almost
01:40:11 having all his shit fulfilled
01:40:13 but even Kickstarter you weren't personally a part of
01:40:15 you're fulfilling now
01:40:17 Radcon
01:40:19 it's actually
01:40:21 I didn't really mention it
01:40:23 but Radcon 2
01:40:25 the documentary is in there
01:40:27 it's one of the bonus features
01:40:29 people might actually
01:40:31 the watch alongs
01:40:33 are not quality content
01:40:35 they're long
01:40:37 some of them might be funny
01:40:39 but they're pretty low quality
01:40:41 it's content that exists
01:40:43 they might as well go on there
01:40:45 yeah
01:40:47 it was bonus content for backers
01:40:49 so I put it on the disc
01:40:51 but the Radcon 2
01:40:53 that was never uploaded anywhere
01:40:55 and it's edited
01:40:57 it's got interviews
01:40:59 in it and stuff
01:41:01 Victor filmed a bunch of us behind the scenes
01:41:03 at Radcon 2
01:41:05 that's a good little piece
01:41:07 I think it's like 40 minutes
01:41:09 it's an actual little documentary
01:41:11 of what we were all doing behind the scenes at Radcon 2
01:41:13 and I think it's the only place you can see it
01:41:15 that's a quality little bit
01:41:17 of exclusive content
01:41:19 that I think is pretty neat
01:41:21 a tectonic improv provided me
01:41:23 with the links to that
01:41:25 wait
01:41:27 what's up
01:41:29 wait how did tectonic improv
01:41:31 because he was a backer
01:41:33 yeah it was like
01:41:35 backers got a link to like a
01:41:37 what do you call it
01:41:39 a
01:41:41 google drive
01:41:43 that had bonus content in it
01:41:45 including all the watch alongs and stuff
01:41:47 and then of course there's the exclusive
01:41:49 message from Ben Sain
01:41:51 as the first bonus feature
01:41:53 in which I give my thoughts on the situation
01:41:55 it's got to see the message from Ben Sain
01:41:57 that's like
01:41:59 if you haven't heard the message
01:42:01 from Ben Sain
01:42:03 what are you even doing
01:42:05 you're not a real plebe in the weeb head
01:42:07 that's the final piece of plebe in the weeb related content
01:42:09 that will ever be produced
01:42:11 I think so
01:42:13 I think you should be called
01:42:15 dweebs
01:42:17 I think the generic term should be dweebs
01:42:19 I was thinking
01:42:21 I'm gonna make an NFT series
01:42:23 based on like those character designs
01:42:25 they should be called
01:42:27 dweebs
01:42:29 just take that design and run it to like a million
01:42:31 different variations
01:42:33 I can see that
01:42:35 yes just iterate it
01:42:37 do like a stone toss style thing of like
01:42:39 okay I just have a bunch of different eyes
01:42:41 a bunch of different mouths, a bunch of different whatever
01:42:43 and randomize
01:42:45 here they are
01:42:47 dweebs is the name
01:42:49 yeah let's see
01:42:51 do I have anything else to say about that
01:42:53 Trixie is
01:42:55 too cowardly
01:42:57 to acknowledge it
01:42:59 it's probably
01:43:01 this is probably my last hurrah
01:43:03 like yeah I can't
01:43:05 it would be hard to top
01:43:07 what else is there to do
01:43:09 you have to really start from square one
01:43:11 what else is there to say
01:43:13 just solid own
01:43:15 full album
01:43:17 I hope you will buy them
01:43:19 I think I have sold exactly
01:43:21 50 of them
01:43:23 that's pretty good honestly dude
01:43:25 a few
01:43:27 I don't know
01:43:29 I guess I'm not that surprised that there's like a market for it
01:43:31 but like it's just
01:43:33 I wouldn't have also been that surprised if a lot of people are just like
01:43:35 I don't want to buy a blu-ray for this shit
01:43:37 I can just go watch it on YouTube if I care
01:43:39 they don't get the exclusive content though
01:43:41 okay
01:43:43 I'll break it down
01:43:45 buying are like actually people who
01:43:47 you know pledge to the kickstarter
01:43:49 and actually want their thing versus how many people are just like
01:43:51 oh that looks funny I'll pay for it
01:43:53 very few only
01:43:55 that's what I was curious about
01:43:57 interesting
01:43:59 okay
01:44:01 only nine people are like yeah I pledge to the
01:44:03 kickstarter
01:44:05 thanks for making it
01:44:07 can I have my copy
01:44:09 the majority are just like
01:44:11 yeah I want one I guess
01:44:13 I
01:44:15 I spent about
01:44:17 okay
01:44:19 I'll break it down a little bit
01:44:21 I paid slow but on like
01:44:23 $150 to make the files
01:44:25 the
01:44:27 50 DVDs
01:44:29 cost me like $100
01:44:31 or blu-rays cost me blank ones cost me
01:44:33 $100
01:44:35 the cases cost me like 20 for
01:44:37 50 and then printing the labels cost
01:44:39 me like $40
01:44:41 and then
01:44:43 so Ctole got me a blu-ray
01:44:45 burner
01:44:47 but the one he got me broke
01:44:49 so I had to get another one
01:44:51 and I also needed a printer
01:44:53 to print on the
01:44:55 disc which is a little bit
01:44:57 hard to find like I tried to get a printing
01:44:59 company to do it and no one would do it
01:45:01 so I had to
01:45:03 get a printer capable of doing it
01:45:05 fortunately it wasn't that expensive that printer
01:45:07 ended up costing $200
01:45:09 and the blu-ray burner cost
01:45:11 a little less than $100 or about
01:45:13 $100 so all in all
01:45:15 I probably spent maybe like
01:45:17 I don't know
01:45:19 it was maybe like $300
01:45:21 on materials and then
01:45:23 the burner and the
01:45:25 printer were another $300 but like
01:45:27 I keep those so
01:45:29 I don't know if that really counts as an expense
01:45:31 because like now I have a new printer and that's pretty cool
01:45:33 so selling the 50
01:45:35 copies has made it has paid for
01:45:37 all the materials it has paid
01:45:39 the cost of the printer
01:45:41 and the burner and I have made
01:45:43 like a few hundred dollars in addition to that
01:45:45 on top of that. Damn I can't wait to get Phantoms Revenge
01:45:47 on printed onto a blu-ray
01:45:49 Yeah you gotta make a PS4 version
01:45:51 so that you can put it on a blu-ray and send it
01:45:55 I bought another batch
01:45:57 of 50 DVDs
01:45:59 and cases and labels I'm hoping
01:46:01 to sell most of them. I'm definitely gonna buy one
01:46:03 If I don't sell
01:46:05 Thank you. I hope everybody will buy one.
01:46:07 I honestly
01:46:09 I think you mentioned this Samoy. I am impressed
01:46:11 that you went to the effort of making it
01:46:13 like a real DVD instead of just
01:46:15 throwing the files on a thing and like the
01:46:17 autoplay when you throw them on a DVD player
01:46:19 like it has a freaking menu guys.
01:46:21 That's what Trixie was gonna do.
01:46:23 At that point it's like
01:46:25 why even bother having it on a blu-ray because
01:46:27 if you're just gonna have the files basically
01:46:29 just go watch it. You know what I mean?
01:46:31 Yeah.
01:46:33 I was like no. I'm gonna make it like
01:46:35 I'm gonna make this like a nice little
01:46:37 collectible item. A nice little thing to put
01:46:39 on your shelf.
01:46:41 This is gonna be on someone's shelf out there
01:46:43 and someone will be like what the fuck is this
01:46:45 and someone will be like oh boy okay how do I even explain this
01:46:47 okay so there was a Kickstarter and there's this guy
01:46:49 Ben St. and he was really mad about
01:46:51 a lot of things
01:46:53 That's the
01:46:55 I made the back of the label
01:46:57 you know I wrote the whole like
01:46:59 the back of the label is not about what plebe
01:47:01 and the weeb is. The back of the label is about
01:47:03 Ben St. and why Ben hates Trixie.
01:47:05 I saw some people upset about that
01:47:07 in Jesse's server
01:47:09 they just wanted the label to just be about
01:47:11 Wait what? Say what?
01:47:13 I saw some people were upset about that being
01:47:15 the back of the case. They just wanted it to
01:47:17 just be about plebe and the weeb
01:47:19 which I completely wouldn't exist
01:47:21 without Ben St's
01:47:23 furious anger so like you know
01:47:25 like you know I think he earned the right
01:47:27 to put it on the back. Like it's not like he
01:47:29 went into every episode and like
01:47:31 digitally inserted himself going
01:47:33 by the way this is why these guys are dumb
01:47:35 you know what I mean?
01:47:37 Was a relevant blurb
01:47:39 part of the stretch goals?
01:47:41 Ben St. appears on screen, green screen
01:47:43 points that these guys are fucking with me
01:47:45 A relevant blurb wasn't
01:47:47 part of the stretch goals so
01:47:49 the blue rays exist as promised
01:47:51 so that's all that matters
01:47:53 Neither was the coveted
01:47:55 exclusive message from Ben St
01:47:57 Wait how much
01:47:59 How much of the kickstart
01:48:01 of money did Jesse receive?
01:48:03 Do you think?
01:48:05 That I don't know
01:48:07 I heard people saying that Trixie received like 7k
01:48:09 but I don't know if that's accurate
01:48:11 The whole
01:48:13 the whole campaign raised
01:48:15 7k
01:48:17 750
01:48:19 Is that true?
01:48:21 I said it's not like all of that one
01:48:23 Oh yeah
01:48:25 She said she paid Jesse
01:48:27 something and I don't know
01:48:29 how much it was so I really don't know how it breaks down
01:48:31 Some money
01:48:33 Some money
01:48:35 because Jesse had the whole like his
01:48:37 house flooded or whatever
01:48:39 I vaguely recall
01:48:41 like
01:48:43 the money was for editing all of the
01:48:45 episodes
01:48:47 and being in them I guess
01:48:49 but I don't know what the number was
01:48:51 This one
01:48:53 Yeah I shouldn't give a
01:48:55 But the kickstarter for Radcon 2
01:48:57 or the kickstarter for plebe and the weave
01:48:59 included like getting flights
01:49:01 for people for Radcon 2 as well
01:49:03 The stretch goals were
01:49:05 basically plane tickets to fly us out there
01:49:07 to be on plebe and the weave episodes
01:49:09 and I think one of the stretch goals was
01:49:11 like when we get everyone
01:49:13 out there we'll have Radcon 2
01:49:15 I think
01:49:17 it was mentioned somewhere
01:49:19 Right
01:49:21 Let's see
01:49:23 I feel like there was
01:49:25 maybe one other thing I wanted to mention
01:49:27 about it
01:49:29 I don't know
01:49:31 It's just
01:49:33 Money
01:49:35 Give me money please
01:49:37 Give me money
01:49:39 If I have some
01:49:41 I'll probably have a few left over
01:49:43 But that's okay whatever
01:49:45 Maybe like I'll just have
01:49:47 20 or 30 copies left over
01:49:49 It's fine whatever
01:49:51 It turned a profit it's okay
01:49:53 Give away to your patrons
01:49:55 with the left over ones
01:49:57 I've always been interested
01:49:59 in like home media releases
01:50:01 for like internet shows
01:50:03 I have like the first quote unquote season of angry video game nerd
01:50:05 on dvd and I have much other stupid shit
01:50:07 like red vs blue
01:50:09 and mega 64 dvds
01:50:11 I've always been fascinated
01:50:13 by this
01:50:15 I've been fascinated by that kind of stuff
01:50:17 and this is
01:50:19 not only is this that
01:50:21 this is like a physical release of internet thing
01:50:23 but like it's way weirder than that
01:50:25 because of all the shit that's gone down since then
01:50:27 I
01:50:29 I love thinking about someone
01:50:31 it was the same with road to radcon
01:50:33 like on the back of road to radcon
01:50:35 I had the little blurb explaining what it was
01:50:37 I can't imagine reading that
01:50:39 with no knowledge of the PCP
01:50:41 That would be so confusing
01:50:43 It's like someone finding it
01:50:45 and being like what is this book
01:50:47 and then the back of display it's like
01:50:49 okay so there was a thing called radcon
01:50:51 from like a podcast called the procrastinators
01:50:53 and they wrote a book
01:50:55 but then like one of them quit
01:50:57 and then the other one like printed it
01:50:59 and like okay I guess
01:51:01 it's great
01:51:03 it's great
01:51:05 comedy gold
01:51:07 mate I'm hoping
01:51:09 it's like
01:51:11 what's the word for like
01:51:13 environmental storytelling
01:51:15 but in real life
01:51:17 it's just sort of it's like a weird artifact
01:51:19 that would puzzle someone
01:51:21 it's not just like oh it's a figure from
01:51:23 an anime it's a book
01:51:25 about
01:51:27 some people on a podcast
01:51:29 it's so exciting right I love that
01:51:31 who are these it's a lesser known
01:51:33 podcast as well it's not like a big thing
01:51:35 no no this isn't like
01:51:37 this isn't like you didn't find
01:51:39 you know the fucking
01:51:41 like D&D
01:51:43 comics from the
01:51:45 my brother my brother and me
01:51:47 thing
01:51:49 that's dumb everybody knows that
01:51:51 you should have like some weird shit
01:51:53 that's some weirdos printed out a few extra
01:51:55 road to radcon and just like leave them like
01:51:57 good wills and just like random places
01:51:59 like so someone at some point will find it and just be like
01:52:01 what the fuck is this
01:52:03 I have like
01:52:05 45 copies just sitting in a box
01:52:07 and I could spare a few
01:52:09 why not
01:52:11 I just imagine someone in 100 years being like
01:52:13 what the fuck was going on in the past
01:52:17 in the past
01:52:19 imagine you're like
01:52:21 you're like
01:52:23 you're like man I'm curious
01:52:25 like what were things like in the
01:52:27 past and then you're like hmm and you're like
01:52:29 just going through random and you pick up
01:52:31 road to radcon you read the back of
01:52:33 like radcon
01:52:35 like did you bro like what the fuck
01:52:37 man the past was fucking
01:52:39 just imagine someone picturing radcon
01:52:41 like 100 people like they just
01:52:43 think it's like a convention you know like they don't understand
01:52:47 in 50
01:52:49 years from now someone will find it and be like
01:52:51 huh what the fuck was going on in the past
01:52:53 like this would have been an NFT today
01:52:55 this would be on the blockchain like
01:52:57 I haven't seen a physical book in years
01:52:59 they find a book like what is this some kind of
01:53:01 physical pdf
01:53:03 NFT I don't understand
01:53:05 wait it's
01:53:07 they pick it up and they're like
01:53:09 wait I can't
01:53:11 funge it it's not fungible but it's not
01:53:13 on the blockchain it's in
01:53:15 physical space it's in my hands
01:53:17 how am I supposed to read this
01:53:19 book if it hasn't been verified on the blockchain
01:53:21 by that point we'll be
01:53:23 at web 4.0 and I can't even imagine
01:53:25 how horrible that'll be
01:53:29 I wish web 4.0
01:53:31 I wish they would just stop counting
01:53:33 I wish they would just stop
01:53:35 incrementing the number so
01:53:37 and then it would all be okay
01:53:39 once we get to web 8.0
01:53:41 then the spiders will take over the earth
01:53:43 and
01:53:45 they'll have a real world wide web
01:53:47 which is all in it
01:53:51 cute
01:53:53 it's finking too far ahead
01:53:55 that was pretty good
01:53:57 I want
01:53:59 everyone to buy
01:54:01 if we ever get that damn
01:54:03 dojin, if we ever get that damn
01:54:05 radcon dojin done
01:54:07 so much merch so much
01:54:09 so much weird radcon
01:54:11 PC shit to purchase
01:54:13 you'll get road to radcon
01:54:15 in your own home for your shelf
01:54:17 you've got the road to radcon
01:54:19 you've got the plebe in the weave
01:54:21 and you've also got phantom's revenge
01:54:23 you're working on which again as I already explained
01:54:25 in the nicest possible way
01:54:27 it's the weirdest, most hard to understand
01:54:29 do you ever plan on making something
01:54:31 that normal human beings can comprehend
01:54:33 and understand without a million years
01:54:35 of internet lore behind them
01:54:37 that's something good about the paper
01:54:39 which is you can just pick it up
01:54:41 and read it
01:54:43 what's the point
01:54:45 if there's not
01:54:47 if you just understand it
01:54:49 I'm with you man, I like the weird internet shit
01:54:51 so don't take it as like
01:54:53 I don't know
01:54:57 yeah, I'll make normal shit at some point
01:54:59 you know, I ain't gonna finish
01:55:01 my fucking Winnie the Pooh
01:55:03 my Winnie the Pooh retrospective
01:55:05 dude, Winnie the Pooh just became public domain
01:55:07 yeah, it's perfect time for that, you gotta do it
01:55:09 but only the shirtless con
01:55:11 if he's wearing a red shirt
01:55:13 you will get sued
01:55:15 have you seen the Ned Flanders meme
01:55:17 if he's
01:55:19 if he's red and yellow
01:55:21 that's Mickey's fellow
01:55:23 if he's shirtless and brown, you're in fair use town
01:55:25 I love it, it's a good bit
01:55:27 yeah, it is
01:55:31 excited though, excited
01:55:33 man, imagine what the
01:55:35 with the twitter artist community
01:55:37 can do now that
01:55:39 Winnie the Pooh is fair use
01:55:41 the possibilities are endless
01:55:45 so if you gave him like
01:55:47 a blue shirt
01:55:49 I guess
01:55:51 there's like little things
01:55:53 like I think Tigger is a Disney character
01:55:55 like you can't just use everything
01:55:57 but I think the rest of the cast should be okay
01:55:59 just don't use
01:56:01 wait, are they guess the original stories might be
01:56:03 fair use now huh
01:56:05 orange
01:56:07 they must be
01:56:11 anything that's Disney original
01:56:13 and also like the specific
01:56:15 like Disney character designs
01:56:17 are not fair use
01:56:19 but
01:56:21 I don't know
01:56:23 so just draw badly and give him a blue shirt
01:56:25 and you can just do the entire film
01:56:27 so like gopher
01:56:29 right, gopher is a Disney original
01:56:31 he was not in the original books I don't think
01:56:33 so tragically
01:56:35 artists, I'm sorry
01:56:37 you can't use gopher, I know you were all like
01:56:39 clamoring for
01:56:41 the gopher fandom is like
01:56:43 heartbroken
01:56:45 the gopher verse
01:56:47 it kind of
01:56:49 it kind of reminds me of how
01:56:51 the wizard of Oz is public domain
01:56:53 but not the red slippers because I was
01:56:55 invented for the movie
01:56:57 wait
01:56:59 you mean
01:57:01 what are you talking about
01:57:03 the wizard of Oz is public domain
01:57:05 but not the red slippers because I was
01:57:07 invented for the movie
01:57:09 oh
01:57:11 right, they were like silver shoes
01:57:13 yeah, they were the 7 dragons balls
01:57:15 there's
01:57:17 a million fucking Oz books
01:57:19 there's a lot of weird shit in that whole
01:57:21 I guess I didn't realize it was public domain
01:57:23 right
01:57:25 there's the wizard of Oz, the warlock of Oz
01:57:27 the mage of Oz
01:57:29 the fighter of Oz, the thief of Oz
01:57:31 the paladin of Oz
01:57:33 the cleric of Oz
01:57:35 the goblin of Oz
01:57:37 a whole RPG
01:57:39 party's worth
01:57:41 of Oz books, I guess
01:57:43 yeah, I've heard
01:57:45 about those, I've never
01:57:47 I mean, I've never read
01:57:49 any of you have read the Oz books
01:57:51 I haven't, I haven't read it
01:57:53 they actually did make a JRPG about the wizard of Oz
01:57:55 for the DS
01:57:57 yeah
01:57:59 yeah, I believe that
01:58:01 I believe that completely
01:58:03 that seems like the kind of thing that would be
01:58:05 right for like a Tim
01:58:07 that would be right for like
01:58:09 a Tim Burton
01:58:11 like Grimdark reimagining
01:58:13 I thought you were going to say
01:58:15 they must have done those
01:58:17 I thought you were going to say a Tim Rogers video essay
01:58:19 about the
01:58:21 wizard of Oz
01:58:23 JRPG
01:58:25 yeah
01:58:27 um
01:58:29 fucking
01:58:31 I don't know, no, did they make
01:58:33 Oz video games? Yeah, they probably did
01:58:35 yeah, it seems like
01:58:37 someone would make um
01:58:39 RPG maker like survival
01:58:41 yeah
01:58:43 indie RPG maker top down
01:58:45 yeah, ones like that
01:58:47 I could see it in my mind
01:58:49 you make the scarecrow scary
01:58:51 yeah
01:58:55 duh
01:58:57 stupid
01:58:59 what are you fucking stupid bro
01:59:01 wait a minute
01:59:03 wait a minute, we can't have dark
01:59:05 themes
01:59:07 in children's media
01:59:09 what was I making fun of
01:59:11 there was some like
01:59:13 some post was going around that was like
01:59:15 oh it was Animorphs
01:59:17 oh
01:59:19 I saw someone posting like
01:59:21 bro, like I just read this Animorphs
01:59:23 book and it's about like child soldiers
01:59:25 and like there's war
01:59:27 it's about how war is bad and like people die
01:59:29 and they get killed and I was like oh my god
01:59:31 this is so
01:59:33 fucked up
01:59:35 they get that one past the censors
01:59:37 I can't believe they made kids
01:59:39 read these in school
01:59:41 they forced them to do it
01:59:43 anything that's like
01:59:45 darker than Barney the dinosaur is
01:59:47 really amazing that kids could actually
01:59:49 watch that
01:59:51 like I know, in the
01:59:53 Animorphs lecture we did
01:59:55 we were a bit guilty of it as well
01:59:57 we also like clapped and cheered and were like
01:59:59 whoa and it was like
02:00:01 all child soldiers genocide
02:00:03 war crimes
02:00:05 there was some war crimes
02:00:07 particularly weird shit in Animorphs
02:00:09 beyond just like you know
02:00:11 child soldiers
02:00:13 body horror stuff that one in particular
02:00:15 I'll say is a little weird but other than that
02:00:17 I don't have anything against dark themes
02:00:21 yeah
02:00:23 body horror
02:00:25 you know what else that annoyed me on twitter
02:00:27 you know what else annoyed me on twitter
02:00:29 this week
02:00:31 a lot of things annoyed me on twitter
02:00:33 I'm gonna throw one of our
02:00:35 former guests under the bus
02:00:37 and say it was very irritated by
02:00:39 Mallory Eudicious's
02:00:41 posts recently
02:00:43 you know her, she's the
02:00:45 the new guy
02:00:47 girl
02:00:49 they've been
02:00:51 they've been posting on their main account about
02:00:53 like I've decided twitter is bad
02:00:55 and I'm quitting
02:00:57 I just kept posting about like
02:00:59 I'm quitting twitter now
02:01:01 oh I can't believe more people are following
02:01:03 oh people are patroning me
02:01:05 quitting twitter is based but like
02:01:07 actually doing it is based
02:01:09 not making a big deal of it
02:01:11 she may
02:01:13 actually do it at some point
02:01:15 but it's annoying to be like
02:01:17 I'm totally leaving twitter guys
02:01:19 I'm really doing it
02:01:21 you saw Lindsay Ellis
02:01:23 she's like done with being a public internet person
02:01:25 and then like as soon as she announced
02:01:27 she's like this patreon
02:01:29 will no longer be putting out things
02:01:31 and it got like 3000 new members
02:01:33 yes
02:01:35 it did
02:01:37 it went from like 8000 to like 12000
02:01:39 that must have been intentional
02:01:41 because she put her goodbye message behind a paywall
02:01:45 okay people got mad at me
02:01:47 because I said she paywalled the message
02:01:49 and people were like no she didn't
02:01:51 but like she definitely did
02:01:53 she definitely did
02:01:55 like the first few hours ago
02:01:57 it wasn't paywalled and then she made it paywalled
02:01:59 oh it's interesting because I was going to say
02:02:01 I think I remember seeing it and it wasn't paywalled
02:02:03 and then that's weird that she would do it in that order
02:02:05 because like you know once it's been out there
02:02:07 it's been you need to text you
02:02:09 just copy paste it it's not even like hard to
02:02:11 replicate
02:02:13 so yeah I did not actually
02:02:15 read the post
02:02:17 so I can't comment on what she
02:02:19 actually said in it
02:02:21 so is that I heard
02:02:23 is that I heard she's quitting
02:02:25 being a youtuber or an internet person
02:02:27 and
02:02:29 it was an interesting
02:02:31 I'm not here to shit on her or anything
02:02:33 I don't want to start drama not that I mean
02:02:35 not that we're even on the same level but like
02:02:37 it was a very melodramatic post and it was a little cringe
02:02:39 and it was she's mad
02:02:41 she still buttered that she got cancelled over like some
02:02:43 dumb twitter take about
02:02:45 freaking like avatar the last airbender
02:02:47 like nobody fucking cares
02:02:49 yeah that whole thing
02:02:51 it was people getting mad at her
02:02:53 for like not like the take itself
02:02:55 like people calling her racist
02:02:57 and stuff like I'm sure when you're a creator
02:02:59 of that size you just have to deal with a lot of
02:03:01 bullshit so like I get it it's not like
02:03:03 how dare she be fed up with twitter
02:03:05 of course she of course she have haters
02:03:07 I didn't think her post was too melodramatic
02:03:09 no she can totally leave if she wants
02:03:11 what is very reasonable is just like
02:03:13 being an internet creator has like
02:03:15 a lot of stresses that I'm just not prepared
02:03:17 for and it's not for me
02:03:19 which I think is fair
02:03:21 that's okay
02:03:23 that's okay you don't
02:03:25 tell me you aren't cut out for being an internet person
02:03:27 you can leave if you want
02:03:29 you don't have to make youtube videos
02:03:31 if you don't want to make them
02:03:33 it's okay
02:03:35 oh yeah that was basically it
02:03:37 well she's like she's like writes books
02:03:39 and stuff too and she's like I don't even know if I want
02:03:41 to write books with my name because my name
02:03:43 is like you know tainted or whatever
02:03:45 it's been tarnished by people
02:03:47 by viewers calling me racist online
02:03:49 jkls
02:03:51 haha
02:03:53 you know
02:03:55 I'm just like
02:03:57 I guess I feel
02:03:59 you know I feel a bit the same way
02:04:01 they're not on the same level but I feel a bit the same
02:04:03 about like you know
02:04:05 Lindsay Ellis yeah some people hate on Lindsay Ellis
02:04:07 some people like call her racist for like
02:04:09 a stupid tweet she made
02:04:11 you know people hate on her like that
02:04:13 and you're like you know Mallory
02:04:15 a lot of people hate her and be like oh she's
02:04:17 a shoplift supporter like she's
02:04:19 a criminal yeah that whole controversy
02:04:21 was incredibly stupid
02:04:23 okay that
02:04:25 it still happens
02:04:27 there's people still make threads
02:04:29 about like Mallory is bad because
02:04:31 shoplifting and like I can't believe
02:04:33 she would support like every time
02:04:35 I lose my fucking
02:04:37 mind every time like there's literally nothing
02:04:39 in the world that makes me matter then people making a
02:04:41 thread about how like Mallory is bad
02:04:43 because she made a comic where someone shop
02:04:45 insanely done and that's like terrible at this point
02:04:47 like for God's sake it's insane
02:04:49 I saw a thread about that
02:04:51 like last week and someone and someone was like
02:04:53 the thread was like guys
02:04:55 what's worst the worst thing about
02:04:57 this the worst thing about this comic
02:04:59 about shoplifting is that she shop lifted
02:05:01 from BIC
02:05:03 or from Blick which is family owned
02:05:05 it's a family
02:05:07 owned company that she was stealing from
02:05:09 and someone responded
02:05:11 in all seriousness
02:05:13 like I can't like that's disgusting
02:05:15 like I can't believe
02:05:17 from a family owned company
02:05:19 and I'm like
02:05:21 she had some article right
02:05:23 she put an article out about like this whole
02:05:25 her dealing with the online harassment and she was like
02:05:27 she was like she was like I wasn't making
02:05:29 this comic to be like it was a bio
02:05:31 I was just like
02:05:33 I wasn't making the comic to be like this is you should
02:05:35 steal stealing is based even though it is a little base she wasn't
02:05:37 she was really just like I wanted just to like make
02:05:39 a comic about a character who like
02:05:41 has like you know just like
02:05:43 yeah like people people thought
02:05:45 yeah people people thought it was
02:05:47 a self insert right yes
02:05:49 it was not meant to be that's what she said when she was on
02:05:51 we had her as a
02:05:53 we had her as a guest and that's what she said she's like
02:05:55 it's literally just a
02:05:57 you know it's it's a fiction it's a comic
02:05:59 about a care I mean she did say in a tweet
02:06:01 that like yeah she used to shop lift
02:06:03 art supplies when she was like a teenager
02:06:05 you know the fucking
02:06:07 uh the woe woe
02:06:09 betide should to get mad about on twitter
02:06:11 okay people getting mad about that it's just like
02:06:13 I can't even write my head around it like what the
02:06:15 fuck is it it makes me so mad
02:06:17 what's what's what's even stupid
02:06:19 oh sorry
02:06:21 well but that okay that's not the
02:06:23 point the point is right yes
02:06:25 obviously that all makes me mad
02:06:27 like never nevertheless
02:06:29 nevertheless like I
02:06:31 definitely don't feel bad for
02:06:33 her because like ultimately
02:06:35 the controversy has gotten her a lot of exposure
02:06:37 and made her a lot more successful I know
02:06:39 that that is the case
02:06:41 and I feel the exact same way about
02:06:43 and I feel the same way
02:06:45 and I feel the same way about Lindsay like
02:06:47 like I'm sorry like I'm sorry
02:06:49 you're upset that like
02:06:51 many people on the internet
02:06:53 don't like you they make
02:06:55 they make they maybe they harass you
02:06:57 in various ways on like social media
02:06:59 or whatever uh they
02:07:01 mean things about you and you get hate
02:07:03 on the internet like I'm very sorry about
02:07:05 that but like fuck's sake
02:07:07 I will I could never I could never
02:07:09 in a million years feel bad for
02:07:11 Lindsay Ellis it's uh yeah
02:07:13 so fucking successful it is a little like
02:07:15 she's got like like sure like
02:07:17 these bad things might happen to you but like
02:07:19 you've obviously gotten so much
02:07:21 out of your internet celebrity
02:07:23 and your position like it's obviously
02:07:25 been a massive net good for you like
02:07:27 I can't possibly be expected
02:07:29 to feel sorry I'm empathetic in the
02:07:31 sense that it must suck having a million
02:07:33 people post dumb shit at you
02:07:35 and say you're racist on Twitter when you're not
02:07:37 like that really probably does suck a lot
02:07:39 and like might take shit out of your mental health
02:07:41 absolutely and you don't have to be on Twitter
02:07:43 if you don't want to or anything like that
02:07:45 but yeah I absolutely agree which is like
02:07:47 I think here's I'm not like one of these like
02:07:49 guys who gives a fucking like
02:07:51 cancel culture but I think
02:07:53 the like sort of accepted theory
02:07:55 on why she's so buttered about it is like
02:07:57 she was very instrumental
02:07:59 and like this whole like
02:08:01 Twitter you know going after
02:08:03 someone when they have like the wrong take
02:08:05 and like really going hard at them and
02:08:07 she just wasn't like mentally prepared for that
02:08:09 to happen to her you know what I mean
02:08:11 wait wait wait
02:08:13 you cut out you cut out she was
02:08:15 she was involved in what now
02:08:17 people in general like
02:08:19 are saying that she was involved with like
02:08:21 going around like you know cancelling people for having
02:08:23 being racist on Twitter like that's the kind
02:08:25 of things that she would do is like start
02:08:27 like these mobs like everyone we need to dog-pile
02:08:29 this person for having a bad take so she just
02:08:31 couldn't believe that it
02:08:33 happened to her like I like like I thought
02:08:35 everyone knew I was on the right side of history
02:08:37 and like I would never be racist so like all the people
02:08:39 like all the people jump down my throat all the people
02:08:41 betray me like you know it must suck
02:08:43 to have your friends like not stand up for you when you
02:08:45 make a take that's not even racist at all and people
02:08:47 like all it's racist and you know people just want to distance
02:08:49 myself from that and not get involved you know what I mean
02:08:51 so I do have empathy
02:08:53 what I'm just saying like the only thing I
02:08:55 want to say is that like I mean yeah if
02:08:57 I were in her position I feel like I'd
02:08:59 handle it better and I'd be able to like
02:09:01 be like well the success is worth it but
02:09:03 everyone's brains work differently and
02:09:05 some people just can't handle that and
02:09:07 there's nothing to be held against from
02:09:09 for it so I
02:09:11 I don't hold I don't hold it again
02:09:13 I don't hold it against okay fair
02:09:15 but I also
02:09:17 don't feel any pity
02:09:19 for her and I never would
02:09:21 I think it's a pretty fair take
02:09:23 like you know when you're making six figures
02:09:25 a year making like media analysis
02:09:27 and then you know
02:09:29 the worst thing that happens to you is people are mean to you online
02:09:31 and it's and it's and it's just
02:09:33 and it's just a little annoying and it's not
02:09:35 even I can't even hold this against her right it's
02:09:37 not that I'm like she did something
02:09:39 bad like with her announcement
02:09:41 and then she got a bunch of support and
02:09:43 and it's just annoying to see her be
02:09:45 like I quit and the response and to have
02:09:47 like an overwhelming like
02:09:49 let's give her some more money
02:09:51 like it's like why
02:09:53 it's like there were just really weird things
02:09:55 in her post like like oh I employ a bunch
02:09:57 of people and like you know like I'm responsible
02:09:59 for paying their salary and I haven't even told them that I'm
02:10:01 quitting making content they're gonna find out when they read
02:10:03 this post I was just like what the fuck is this
02:10:05 shit
02:10:07 yeah that is yeah that is also a point
02:10:09 to it's a bit on having
02:10:11 as much money as you might assume because she
02:10:13 is paying so many people
02:10:15 that's true she has employees
02:10:17 um
02:10:19 I don't know it
02:10:21 it feels a bit like a sort of like
02:10:23 this is
02:10:25 an unfair comparison but you know
02:10:27 that that one
02:10:29 Dar man video god
02:10:31 he's like
02:10:33 where that one Dar man video where it's about
02:10:35 it's about like
02:10:37 it's about
02:10:39 the kid who works as a Dar man
02:10:41 actor getting bullied by people
02:10:43 who say he's in cringy videos
02:10:45 and the basically the plot of the video is like
02:10:47 you know you
02:10:49 you can hate me you can hate me
02:10:51 I Dar man can take it but when you
02:10:53 say mean things about my videos
02:10:55 you're actually hurting
02:10:57 this adorable child star actor
02:10:59 this this young boy who's just trying to get
02:11:01 his career off the ground like this guy
02:11:03 this kid who works for me like I can take it but this kid
02:11:05 you're really hurting this kid
02:11:07 I don't know this seems a little
02:11:09 bit like you know like I like
02:11:11 I Lindsay
02:11:13 well I like I'm responsible for paying
02:11:15 a bunch of people's salaries so
02:11:17 you know I got I got to keep the patreon going
02:11:19 because otherwise how would I continue
02:11:21 to pay all these other people
02:11:23 that I got to pay their
02:11:25 salaries for and like
02:11:27 kind of I mean it's
02:11:29 true well sure
02:11:31 but is that a reason to
02:11:33 but is that a reason
02:11:35 for people to just like pour money
02:11:37 into a you can't
02:11:39 that is now
02:11:41 that is that is now funding
02:11:43 nothing you can't get mad
02:11:45 about people wasting their money and shit
02:11:47 people have bleeding hearts
02:11:49 yeah people I guess
02:11:51 people fucking spend money
02:11:53 stupidly all the time
02:11:55 I mean debatably
02:11:57 stupidly if they enjoy the feeling
02:11:59 of supporting someone then whatever
02:12:01 it's not really
02:12:03 of my business where people do their money
02:12:05 I can understand
02:12:07 that like Lindsay Ellis
02:12:09 leaves
02:12:11 and then people show a lot
02:12:13 of support and it irks
02:12:15 you because where's my
02:12:17 support god damn it I'm still here
02:12:19 okay well there's a little
02:12:21 little more nuance than that
02:12:23 well there's dirt there's a lot
02:12:25 sure sure I just I just feel like
02:12:27 that the whole thing with with Lindsay is
02:12:29 and and Mallory and stuff
02:12:31 like this is that people
02:12:33 either are
02:12:35 super supportive
02:12:37 with their money or they're like
02:12:39 saying things like oh no all
02:12:41 and then there's the
02:12:43 the counteraction to the
02:12:45 like the the reaction
02:12:47 to that is to like say
02:12:49 no don't be nice to them don't be
02:12:51 why are you being so supportive
02:12:53 um fuck
02:12:55 them they're rich and they have
02:12:57 they're rich and they're quitting
02:12:59 they're rich and they're quitting and everyone's like
02:13:01 oh I love it I love it though
02:13:03 well if I was rich
02:13:05 I wouldn't work either
02:13:07 and there's those two sides
02:13:09 of those two takes and I just
02:13:11 feel so exhausted
02:13:13 hearing about either one of them
02:13:15 it's just you know
02:13:17 it doesn't matter other people
02:13:19 it doesn't matter that you're annoyed by people
02:13:21 other people are supporting someone
02:13:23 well you know nothing matters in the end
02:13:25 we're all gonna die I guess
02:13:27 I guess it's just I guess I'm
02:13:29 annoyed by the discourse about it
02:13:31 it really shouldn't
02:13:33 other people quit posting
02:13:35 on the internet all the time
02:13:37 and uh what happens
02:13:39 with them nothing nobody knows
02:13:41 they just leave
02:13:43 they just they just leave and they get
02:13:45 a regular job
02:13:47 I'm not even saying this against Lindsay Ellis
02:13:49 I just mean in general I always sort of have an issue
02:13:51 when people like if you just want to leave the internet whatever
02:13:53 that's fine or I saw this more on forums
02:13:55 two people like I'm they would make a big deal
02:13:57 like I'm leaving the forums they make a big thread
02:13:59 like I'm leaving the forums and this is why
02:14:01 and then like a week later they're still fucking there
02:14:03 you know what I mean like it's a classic
02:14:05 classic that like uh on
02:14:07 on forums that me and my friends owned
02:14:09 we made a rule that if you make a big post saying
02:14:11 you're leaving you get banned that's fair
02:14:13 because people would
02:14:15 people would make those posts and then come back
02:14:17 like a week later you would literally mean
02:14:19 when I was a teenager
02:14:23 you just want people to take you seriously
02:14:25 I understand that stuff is annoying
02:14:27 I just feel like it's
02:14:29 like is there
02:14:31 nothing interesting to talk about these days
02:14:33 that this is such a big thing
02:14:35 I don't you fucking cares
02:14:37 people have been wasting money
02:14:39 on stupid things
02:14:41 you can't be getting mad at other people's patreons
02:14:43 you just don't just don't think about it
02:14:45 you can't be you just can't be
02:14:47 get upset when bad people make money
02:14:49 you want to know how much money Stone Toss made
02:14:51 on his fucking schmorky parody NFTs
02:14:53 oh my god
02:14:55 uh
02:14:57 yeah I saw someone
02:14:59 posting I saw someone
02:15:01 someone
02:15:03 posted about like
02:15:05 oh Stone Toss made NFTs
02:15:07 and like the point was to be like
02:15:09 cringe right yeah but all you're doing is
02:15:11 amplifying him and like spreading that to more people
02:15:13 and like
02:15:15 okay I just
02:15:17 want to say really quick Stone Toss's detractors are like
02:15:19 like
02:15:21 90% of the reason why he's famous
02:15:23 people like oh we're gonna own him
02:15:25 by spreading the amugus meme and all that did
02:15:27 was increase his notoriety and reach
02:15:29 and probably gave him much of children aren't it
02:15:31 like fans
02:15:33 people do the amugus meme for that reason
02:15:35 yeah he just leaned into it
02:15:37 but it's I don't know someone was like
02:15:39 and I responded to that
02:15:41 being like like what's the point
02:15:43 and someone said like it's cringe it's cringe that he makes
02:15:45 NFTs and I was like well
02:15:47 sure I think so
02:15:49 but I know that he made a ton of money off of it
02:15:51 so like he got exactly what he wanted
02:15:53 and someone tried to
02:15:55 tell me like no he's probably just lying
02:15:57 he's probably lying about how much money he made
02:15:59 the one thing about NFTs
02:16:01 and my 3.0 bullshit is like okay first off
02:16:03 you can fake sales I'll give you that like it's not like
02:16:05 without their own possibility but for the most part
02:16:07 this shit is out in the open like we know how much money he's making
02:16:09 yeah it's
02:16:11 quite a lot
02:16:13 that's what
02:16:15 that's what NFTs are for
02:16:17 they're for bilking money out of suckers and like
02:16:19 I'm sure that that's exactly what they did
02:16:21 like there's no reason to think
02:16:23 that this is like a fraud like no
02:16:25 yeah I'm officially at the point
02:16:27 it's so hard to resist making fun of NFTs
02:16:29 we just we just have to live with it
02:16:31 but they get more powerful every time
02:16:33 you pay attention to them like the monsters
02:16:35 and that one episode of The Simpsons
02:16:37 you know the thing that's really annoying
02:16:39 is like people making like intentionally
02:16:41 like oh god
02:16:43 thinking NFTs on purpose to piss people off
02:16:45 and people just take the bait
02:16:47 I was like how could you get mad at this
02:16:49 that one I could tell
02:16:51 that one was so transparently
02:16:53 they couldn't even get mad because it was so
02:16:55 pathetically like scummy
02:16:57 it was like they want me to get mad at this
02:16:59 like that would be winning for them
02:17:01 yeah but people keep
02:17:03 posting about it anyway like they don't
02:17:05 it's the same thing with the George Floyd one too
02:17:07 right right
02:17:09 at least all the video game ones are failing
02:17:11 like the Ubisoft
02:17:13 all these big companies just try to jump in
02:17:15 they're so stupid
02:17:17 but like they don't know how to do it
02:17:19 they're stupid
02:17:21 you mean like
02:17:23 like in-game NFT transactions
02:17:25 Ubisoft did something with Rainbow Six
02:17:27 where they put NFTs in it and they sold like
02:17:29 absolutely terribly and like
02:17:31 people worked out and the minting cost was like
02:17:33 800 times what they made
02:17:35 they just don't
02:17:37 they just don't add anything
02:17:39 and there's the game
02:17:41 stalker and they were going to use NFTs
02:17:43 to help fund the rest of the development
02:17:45 they had to walk that back
02:17:47 yeah everyone screamed at them and they
02:17:49 walked it back and it was like yeah good
02:17:51 it turned out screaming at corporations works
02:17:55 the guy who played Al
02:17:57 Borland in Home Improvement
02:17:59 he was going to do like audio
02:18:01 NFTs
02:18:03 and then everyone screamed at him and he was like
02:18:05 hey sorry
02:18:07 I guess I won't I didn't mean anything
02:18:09 by it and it was great
02:18:11 I do feel a little bad for some of these boomers
02:18:13 and people who just don't they just don't understand
02:18:15 the internet let alone NFTs
02:18:17 and someone's just like hey we can make a lot of money with this thing
02:18:19 you know
02:18:21 he obviously didn't know
02:18:23 like what people were mad at him for
02:18:25 right
02:18:27 someone just came to him
02:18:29 and said like hey what if you
02:18:31 did some voice recordings and we'll
02:18:33 do it on this thing called the blockchain and you'll
02:18:35 get paid and he was like
02:18:37 sure
02:18:39 some people like meet Canyon
02:18:41 did NFTs and sold them and made money
02:18:43 but like when they were like brand new
02:18:45 like that was like a meat like as soon as I learned about NFTs
02:18:47 I saw those and like now they're on record being like
02:18:49 uh yeah we kind of we're not going to do that again
02:18:51 and stuff
02:18:53 yeah psychic pebbles did that
02:18:55 and the other guy that's working on a tv show
02:18:57 right oh god smiling friends that's like
02:18:59 today too isn't it
02:19:01 is that today I think so I think it's today
02:19:03 if it's not today it's like this week

02:19:19 yeah I've seen um I've seen
02:19:21 it like gifts of it around
02:19:23 I like the pilot I thought it was pretty good
02:19:25 and I was like I already I had already coped with
02:19:27 the fact that we wasn't gonna get picked up because it was like a year after
02:19:29 the pilot before they announced it was picked up
02:19:31 I had a feeling it was gonna get picked up the whole time
02:19:33 it should
02:19:35 like it didn't make sense for them not to because it was so popular online
02:19:37 and it was really good but you know you never
02:19:39 know what these fucking companies will do
02:19:43 I don't really know what I think about psychic pebbles
02:19:45 I think I've seen like hellbenders
02:19:47 and that was like
02:19:49 alright I'm gonna be honest
02:19:51 did he do with the hellbenders
02:19:53 I didn't think anything he ever made was fun
02:19:55 I never I don't know anything about the leech pilot
02:19:57 only plays or psychic pebbles I've never seen
02:19:59 any of that shit smiling pet smiling friends was my first
02:20:01 like introduction I was like hey it's pretty good
02:20:03 yeah
02:20:05 that was the only thing they
02:20:07 that was the only thing they made
02:20:09 that I enjoyed
02:20:11 he's a
02:20:13 newgrounds animator boy
02:20:15 and he's got a very distinctive voice
02:20:17 and he's very funny
02:20:19 I like his Trump impression
02:20:21 I recommend one of
02:20:23 one of these guys I forgot where
02:20:25 I recommend like only plays compilations of just psychic
02:20:27 pebbles saying funny shit
02:20:29 because it is very funny
02:20:31 I don't even know about these guys at all
02:20:33 because I don't like watch any only play stuff
02:20:35 but I always like like you know only plays
02:20:37 animated like you know I love to see little animated
02:20:39 clips of things so I've seen like exposure from that
02:20:41 and you know
02:20:43 I don't even know why or how
02:20:45 let's place are still a thing but I guess
02:20:47 there's a few people carrying on the torch
02:20:49 because I mean Game Grumps is technically still going
02:20:51 but I don't know how many people are watching that
02:20:53 Game Grumps is ten years old
02:20:55 did you know that Jesus Christ
02:20:57 it's so funny to me how like John was on
02:20:59 one year but like
02:21:01 that cast such a big shadow over the rest of the show
02:21:03 like you know it's been like
02:21:05 Aaron and Danny for nine years now
02:21:07 but people are still like oh I remember
02:21:09 fucking the original series of the original
02:21:11 episodes of Game Grumps
02:21:13 yeah that's the only time I ever
02:21:15 watched it so obviously that sticks
02:21:17 out the most
02:21:19 yeah I mean I didn't obviously I didn't
02:21:21 stick with watching it but like when I did watch
02:21:23 it it was like you know
02:21:25 yeah it was about like one year and one year
02:21:27 so it feels in my
02:21:29 memory like it was like half John
02:21:31 and half Danny
02:21:33 not even close
02:21:35 anymore
02:21:37 now there are people who are born
02:21:39 who can vote feel old yet
02:21:41 I thought you were like saying that like you know people say that as like a joke
02:21:43 but like that could literally be true which is
02:21:45 fucked up
02:21:47 probably not that many
02:21:49 in your old post John
02:21:51 but there's probably at least some
02:21:53 you'd be surprised
02:21:55 at least a few
02:21:57 I think we mentioned this before
02:21:59 or something but
02:22:01 peep kids these days say oh I want to be a YouTuber when I grow up
02:22:03 that's so fucked up
02:22:05 now kids are going to be saying I want to be an NFT
02:22:07 when I grow up
02:22:09 they have higher aspirations
02:22:11 I want to sell my NFTs on tiktok when I grow up
02:22:13 what the fuck is a YouTube
02:22:15 go outside play with sticks and stones
02:22:17 go outside play with sticks and stones
02:22:19 and break your bones
02:22:21 please
02:22:23 no choice but to be on the web
02:22:25 3.0
02:22:27 we got to upload our consciousness to the
02:22:29 blockchain
02:22:31 what would it have been like if
02:22:33 COVID happened when we were kids
02:22:35 that's weird to think about
02:22:39 I don't want to talk to you
02:22:41 I don't want to have done so much reading
02:22:47 they're so literate right now
02:22:49 I don't even want to think
02:22:51 about it
02:22:53 probably nothing would have
02:22:55 changed for me
02:22:57 except I would have gotten COVID
02:22:59 several times and my brain would have been shrunken
02:23:01 I am very excited for being
02:23:03 an old man and saying I lived through the pandemic
02:23:07 no that's depressing
02:23:09 I hate that
02:23:11 I don't want fucking
02:23:13 what?
02:23:15 explain what life was like
02:23:17 to my grandchildren
02:23:19 we didn't go outside
02:23:21 and then they'll be like
02:23:23 we know
02:23:25 the pandemic is still happening
02:23:27 I don't want
02:23:29 to think about it
02:23:31 I died during the pandemic
02:23:33 this is what it looks like when you're dead
02:23:35 in the future
02:23:37 when I'm old
02:23:39 and kids ask me
02:23:41 what was it like
02:23:43 in 2015
02:23:45 I'll be like
02:23:47 whatever it sucked
02:23:49 who cares
02:23:51 let's just
02:23:53 put on our VR headsets
02:23:55 and play some NFT games
02:23:57 whatever we're doing
02:23:59 who cares about the past
02:24:01 what's going to happen
02:24:03 as soon as it's already happened
02:24:05 2078
02:24:07 daddy
02:24:09 grandpa
02:24:11 what's this book
02:24:13 your face goes red
02:24:15 bitch Trixie
02:24:17 I'm gonna fucking tell you about this
02:24:19 a single tear
02:24:21 of rage
02:24:25 fist clenched
02:24:27 my robot fist clenched
02:24:29 because I got
02:24:31 you do the dangles when you clench your fist so hard
02:24:33 that your hand starts bleeding
02:24:35 and you're so fucking angry
02:24:37 that'll be
02:24:39 that'll be like two years from now
02:24:41 I'll be like
02:24:43 I'll snap my walking stick
02:24:45 I'll throw my crutches
02:24:47 out the window
02:24:49 my walker
02:24:51 the fucking image of clenching your fist so hard
02:24:53 that they both completely explode
02:24:57 that's a great visual gag
02:24:59 that's what Trunks does
02:25:01 fingers go through your palms
02:25:03 and out the back
02:25:05 blood everywhere
02:25:09 delightful
02:25:13 I guess
02:25:15 did we talk about
02:25:17 the new episode of the
02:25:19 Tails gets trolled audio
02:25:21 yeah I was gonna say
02:25:23 after I mentioned my low tax video
02:25:25 I was like shilling successfully
02:25:27 completed but I was like
02:25:29 we should also talk about Tails gets trolled briefly
02:25:31 cuz yeah we were both in that
02:25:33 weren't we Ben
02:25:35 yeah I did not know you were in that
02:25:37 why do you think I put
02:25:39 the voice of Tom from Tom and Jerry
02:25:41 in my Twitter profile
02:25:43 wait is it?
02:25:45 he was in the last episode too
02:25:47 which came out last year
02:25:49 they make one episode a year
02:25:51 yeah it's a little slow
02:25:53 but uh
02:25:55 puke does a great job
02:25:57 or um
02:25:59 whatever
02:26:01 I guess I could call him puke when I'm relating
02:26:03 to the TGT stuff because he still credits himself
02:26:05 is that in the credits
02:26:07 it was well edited and it had some nice little
02:26:09 nice little voice like effects
02:26:11 on there like my voice had
02:26:13 a cool like reverb on it
02:26:15 it was like that sounds great
02:26:17 when he told me you were gonna be
02:26:19 a voice in it I thought you were just gonna use
02:26:21 your normal voice
02:26:23 no well I mean
02:26:25 you'd say hello my children
02:26:27 I am Ben St
02:26:29 and I will give you satanic powers
02:26:31 well he um
02:26:33 yeah it's really funny
02:26:35 I mean Cybershell
02:26:37 you just talked normal
02:26:39 but like your voice
02:26:41 but like you're voicing Tom so like
02:26:43 why wouldn't you just talk like a normal guy
02:26:45 like Tom
02:26:47 well sort of the joke is that Tom doesn't like
02:26:49 he doesn't have a voice unless you count that
02:26:51 you know the god awful movie or whatever
02:26:53 but does anyone really want me to like do an impression of Tom from the movie
02:26:55 well actually
02:26:57 actually puke uh showed me
02:26:59 the normal voice actor tried voicing
02:27:01 Tom at first and it actually sounded like Cybershell's voice
02:27:03 that's just
02:27:05 I'm sorry I mean I know there's actually some people
02:27:07 in the comments are like
02:27:09 it took me out of it just hearing Cybershell
02:27:11 because it's just like his voice
02:27:13 you know what I mean and it's sort of a
02:27:15 easy to recognize voice but I'm like
02:27:17 I'm sorry that's just what Tom sounds like
02:27:19 that's just what he canonically sounds like
02:27:21 in every canon
02:27:23 yeah I mean that's what the voice actor
02:27:25 made him sound like so
02:27:27 I was thinking you should take it up with him
02:27:29 I was thinking like um
02:27:31 I was thinking like Darn
02:27:33 I wish I had more lines
02:27:35 and then I saw
02:27:37 right because I was the voice of Satan
02:27:39 who only appears
02:27:41 basically in that one scene
02:27:43 when they drink the blood
02:27:45 in the ritual in the church
02:27:47 wow
02:27:49 but then
02:27:51 I saw the new page
02:27:53 and the new page features
02:27:55 Satan's back
02:27:57 Satan comes back for a big fucking
02:27:59 awesome
02:28:01 scene which rules
02:28:03 yeah I feel bad I forgot
02:28:05 the artist name but that latest page is
02:28:07 fucking awesome
02:28:09 the artist is Rokinot
02:28:11 that one's so good
02:28:13 so I can't wait to like 10 years
02:28:15 from now voice that
02:28:17 dialogue that would be very
02:28:19 I was looking at some
02:28:21 Tom lines from like chapter like
02:28:23 14 or 16 I can't remember
02:28:25 and being like damn someday
02:28:27 I'll get to voice these I can't wait
02:28:29 yeah that would be good shit
02:28:31 oh the porn the porn argue
02:28:33 yeah there's some funny lines
02:28:35 like Tom only is relevant for the next
02:28:37 like 3 or 4 chapters
02:28:39 and then I don't know if he says
02:28:41 anything after that
02:28:43 I'm not since I'm the tgt
02:28:45 expert I'll tell you he appears
02:28:47 until chapter 16
02:28:49 and then stops appearing until
02:28:51 like chapter 23
02:28:53 I just don't even know if he said anything
02:28:55 since Sylvester has died spoiler alert
02:28:57 you know should read tales gets trolled
02:28:59 yeah
02:29:01 we're doing we're doing really well with releasing
02:29:03 the new page yeah you're actually on like a
02:29:05 pretty consistent schedule which is just like
02:29:07 crazy for tales gets trolled you know what I mean
02:29:09 hmm yeah
02:29:11 aside from
02:29:13 the one year when laser bot was
02:29:15 making a new page every day
02:29:17 I asked him I asked the guy
02:29:19 if he would have if he like
02:29:21 had any more
02:29:23 like voices he needed I told I would totally voice
02:29:25 another one it would be funny if he
02:29:27 just gave me like a more like normal character
02:29:29 that I could just talk in my normal
02:29:31 voice
02:29:33 I'm sure I mean I'm sure there's got to be
02:29:35 I'm sure more characters pop up later
02:29:37 I don't know there's plenty if you just
02:29:39 want a small character they could just give you like a troll
02:29:41 just some random troll who shows up
02:29:43 but I'm sure there's also that would be funny
02:29:45 yeah I think I think the next
02:29:47 chapter is when knuckles
02:29:49 goes to the troll camp and smokes weed
02:29:51 with the random trolls
02:29:53 there might be some good
02:29:55 good voices in there
02:29:57 very funny
02:29:59 it's great
02:30:01 yeah
02:30:03 my plan was to get high and I did
02:30:07 and I voiced
02:30:09 yeah I was Satan but I was also one of the cultists
02:30:11 who has like two lines
02:30:13 and I just did like a stupid
02:30:15 that scene is so funny to me the way like
02:30:17 laser bot like he names every character
02:30:19 but then they all just immediately
02:30:21 there was no point in giving them names
02:30:23 I think the one I did
02:30:25 was Bob
02:30:27 he's just
02:30:29 there to deliver like
02:30:31 one line about the church
02:30:33 oh wait no that's Kevin
02:30:35 there's one of them who says what the gently caresses
02:30:37 with that
02:30:39 because that's something awful
02:30:41 but he doesn't say
02:30:43 I don't know if laser bot was making
02:30:45 a something awful reference
02:30:47 like he thought this will be cute because
02:30:49 that's where they found the comic or he
02:30:51 he might have actually just thought
02:30:53 that's something people say
02:30:55 that was a word filter
02:30:57 if you don't have a something awful account
02:30:59 and you see someone say fuck in a post
02:31:01 it auto word filters to gently caress
02:31:03 for non account holders
02:31:05 he might have just thought people talked like that
02:31:07 he might have
02:31:09 but he didn't say gently caress
02:31:11 he said gently cares right
02:31:13 he said gently cares
02:31:15 I don't think he knows what caress meant
02:31:17 I love all the little typos
02:31:19 and little things like that
02:31:21 it adds so much flavor and texture to the comic
02:31:23 yeah it bothers me
02:31:25 because the song
02:31:27 which is probably my favorite song
02:31:29 the one that J Flay made
02:31:31 for that chapter
02:31:33 he pronounces it as gently caress
02:31:35 when it's gently cares
02:31:37 he didn't know the correct word
02:31:39 I was disappointed to see that he
02:31:41 correctly pronounced the word
02:31:43 that was spelled differently
02:31:45 I was
02:31:47 what's the line
02:31:49 he usually does pronounce them
02:31:51 incorrectly
02:31:53 as they're written
02:31:55 sometimes I feel like you have to find a balance
02:31:57 and sometimes you do have to read out the funny
02:31:59 typo
02:32:01 sometimes I will like
02:32:03 if it's like confusing or something
02:32:05 I'll try and just make it understandable at least
02:32:07 well laser bot himself
02:32:09 pronounced because
02:32:11 when they read his comic
02:32:13 and put it in apostrophe and isle
02:32:15 they pronounce it as ill
02:32:17 but laser bot voiced his own comic
02:32:19 one of the comics
02:32:21 or one of the pages was like an animation
02:32:23 that he did
02:32:25 and he pronounced like everything correctly
02:32:27 so
02:32:29 yeah it's an artistic debate to be had for sure
02:32:33 the last line
02:32:35 Satan says is
02:32:37 I will give you one day
02:32:39 to require these requirements
02:32:41 that's so fucking funny
02:32:47 oh god
02:32:49 that was also like the first instance
02:32:51 of laser bot ever using capital letters
02:32:53 in the comic
02:32:55 that's funny
02:32:57 yeah well historic
02:32:59 I don't know why they just use that
02:33:01 for that one line
02:33:03 Satan's the only one
02:33:07 so that was
02:33:09 the entire chapter 16
02:33:11 it was a highlight of my week
02:33:17 what's everyone been up to
02:33:21 I've been drunk this whole time
02:33:23 I've been rewatching game of thrones
02:33:25 oh wow
02:33:27 game of thrones
02:33:29 how far are you into game of thrones
02:33:31 I've watched it all before
02:33:33 but I'm rewatching the first
02:33:35 I just finished the third season
02:33:37 and
02:33:39 those first four seasons are great
02:33:41 they really are great tv
02:33:43 because they still have the books to work off
02:33:45 oh there's so many good little things in there
02:33:47 real shame but it ended
02:33:49 there's so much good stuff in those first four seasons
02:33:51 I never saw the end
02:33:53 I fell off watching it at like
02:33:55 you got lucky
02:33:57 game of thrones is just
02:33:59 like an anime because they had to make up
02:34:01 retarded filler
02:34:03 straight up a full metal alchemist scenario
02:34:05 where they just had to come up with their own shit
02:34:07 except unlike that
02:34:09 George R. R. Martin will never finish the books
02:34:11 yeah
02:34:13 unlike that the filler they came up with
02:34:15 for full metal alchemist is just better
02:34:17 than the actual source material
02:34:19 sorry not sorry
02:34:25 some people do think that
02:34:27 my partner probably agrees with you
02:34:29 that actually happens
02:34:31 because I was looking at
02:34:33 I was looking at a few clips on youtube
02:34:35 before I decided to start rewatching the show
02:34:37 and there was that one
02:34:39 where Charles dance
02:34:41 Tywin Lannister
02:34:43 is gutting the
02:34:45 the stag on the table and he's telling
02:34:47 Jamie you're a fucking idiot for killing Ned Stark
02:34:49 isn't that his first scene
02:34:51 that's the first scene with Tywin Lannister
02:34:55 he was such a good character dude
02:34:57 Tywin
02:34:59 apparently that scene
02:35:01 was written by
02:35:03 D&D
02:35:05 for the show it wasn't in the books
02:35:07 there is actually
02:35:09 some good filler in the first four seasons
02:35:11 that they made up
02:35:13 and it makes the
02:35:15 the ending of the show
02:35:17 a little more strange
02:35:19 I'm kind of curious to see how
02:35:21 cause like
02:35:23 so early on in like
02:35:25 the march south to King's Landing
02:35:27 who if you know
02:35:29 Bruce Bolton
02:35:31 like what happens
02:35:33 with him and his busted son
02:35:35 it's like
02:35:37 I know he's a villain
02:35:39 but he seems like just a regular
02:35:41 who cares kind of guy in the background
02:35:43 and so rewatching it is like
02:35:45 oh they're actually
02:35:47 doing things they're actually like making little hints
02:35:49 here and there
02:35:51 it's great there's so much packed into
02:35:53 even just the first episode
02:35:55 it's great for
02:35:57 for world building it's great for character development
02:35:59 I think there's like a line in the first episode
02:36:01 where it's like they throw
02:36:03 he's just like oh yeah you
02:36:05 what's your name barriced on Darien you go do this
02:36:07 and he's like okay and then like yeah that like
02:36:09 comes up like two three seasons later you actually
02:36:11 meet that guy and he's like a kind of important character
02:36:13 and it's just like there's a lot of little things that
02:36:15 yeah the first time watching it
02:36:17 not only did I watch Game of Thrones you know like
02:36:19 you know not binge watch it I watch it
02:36:21 like basically as it came out year by year
02:36:23 so that's like a different way to experience a show
02:36:25 versus like actually just going through it again
02:36:27 because you can really notice all like the plot
02:36:29 threads that they like lay down
02:36:31 and you can like notice the ones that like
02:36:33 that doesn't go anywhere they never brought that back up again
02:36:35 you know what I mean
02:36:37 man uh
02:36:39 Cracking Tilly Game of Thrones
02:36:41 the show there's just not enough
02:36:43 heraldry there's not enough like
02:36:47 the books like laying on really thick
02:36:49 like all of these like different houses
02:36:51 and stuff have like these very
02:36:53 specific like color schemes
02:36:55 and like animal motifs
02:36:57 and all of the characters are described in ways
02:36:59 that like evoke the animals
02:37:01 that like their houses are based on
02:37:03 and in the show it just
02:37:05 that just can't you just can't do a thing
02:37:07 like that in the show
02:37:09 so they just kind of don't
02:37:11 I feel like it does
02:37:13 like the toys have like the
02:37:15 the armor that looks like fish scales
02:37:18 yeah a little bit
02:37:20 and the Lannisters have their lion
02:37:22 like stuff and
02:37:24 Ben would you prefer if there was always
02:37:26 would you prefer if there was always a guy
02:37:28 stood in the background holding their flag
02:37:30 like whenever a family was holding another family
02:37:32 that would be awesome
02:37:33 up 100% of course
02:37:35 why would you even ask me that
02:37:37 Ben's saying himself
02:37:39 okay they have flags though
02:37:41 it's just the fucking okay some of the shit
02:37:43 that like some of the shit the heraldry
02:37:45 and the armor that they wear in the books
02:37:47 sounds like like fucking Mecca
02:37:49 like they I think
02:37:51 Tywin Lannister has like one where he's like
02:37:53 has like a full suit of armor where like he just has
02:37:55 like his head is just
02:37:57 it's just like an entire like lion
02:37:59 he's like he's like a fully
02:38:01 like suited like golden man with like a full
02:38:03 like lion head and stuff
02:38:05 Ben is correct there is some cooler
02:38:07 shit that they just had to scale down for the show
02:38:09 like even the iron throne is supposed to be like this
02:38:11 massive giant thing
02:38:13 it's just like a prequel show
02:38:15 it's just a fucking chair
02:38:17 they're making like a prequel show
02:38:19 where they're gonna do the throne justice
02:38:21 it looks like but I don't know if it's gonna be good
02:38:23 I don't know who's gonna like
02:38:25 watch the prequel shows
02:38:27 I feel like every all the normies I know
02:38:29 like have completely like
02:38:31 I haven't heard anyone mention Game of Thrones
02:38:33 in the fucking dog's age
02:38:35 seems like people who read the books would mostly be interested
02:38:37 but it depends on if they got
02:38:39 like actually good people to direct it
02:38:41 if it's a good show then you're right it'll be fine
02:38:43 we'll see
02:38:45 I guess I shouldn't prejudge it
02:38:47 they should do like a
02:38:49 they should do like a young Sheldon and make like one about
02:38:51 like Ned's start growing up
02:38:53 with like old Nan
02:38:55 no no it's like hundreds of years in the past
02:38:57 like
02:38:59 oh then it's not even cool
02:39:01 it's not even cool
02:39:03 is it gonna be like pre Targaryen
02:39:05 rule of Westeros
02:39:07 I think it's dealing with the Targaryen stuff
02:39:09 with all the dragons and shit
02:39:11 seems like it could be cool
02:39:13 see it's funny like
02:39:15 in the show I haven't read the books
02:39:17 but like the Targaryens is really
02:39:19 just Daenerys
02:39:21 and her story is interesting in its
02:39:23 way but I really really
02:39:25 liked all of like
02:39:27 the stupid
02:39:29 house bullshit and bickering
02:39:31 in King's Landing
02:39:33 and the North and all of the houses
02:39:35 and like marrying people off to certain
02:39:37 people to get like land and stuff
02:39:39 that's the interesting stuff
02:39:41 a slice of life anime for Game of Thrones
02:39:43 there's
02:39:45 so much more
02:39:47 I still watch that YouTube channel
02:39:49 that Preston Jacobs guy
02:39:51 I haven't even read like half the books
02:39:53 I've only read like three of them
02:39:55 but I still watch that guy's channel and all
02:39:57 he's like he does
02:39:59 he sort of branched out into other stuff that I'm not as interested in
02:40:01 but his like
02:40:03 I mean you can't blame him for branching out
02:40:05 but I agree with you though
02:40:07 I like the book analysis stuff even as a non-book reader
02:40:09 there's some really interesting stuff
02:40:11 there's so much like shit
02:40:13 there's so much shit
02:40:15 in the books that are like
02:40:17 all these like minor characters
02:40:19 have such like specific like heraldry
02:40:21 associated with them and Preston can take that
02:40:23 and be like oh okay
02:40:25 so we can actually like this guy if you think about it
02:40:27 you can actually be like oh
02:40:29 we can like kind of figure out this guy's entire
02:40:31 like parentage and like the whole
02:40:33 like bloodline that he's from
02:40:35 and like therefore like how does he
02:40:37 how does he probably feel
02:40:39 about like
02:40:41 maesters and dragons and
02:40:43 you know like which side would he
02:40:45 probably prefer in this
02:40:47 you know is he a religious
02:40:49 is he from a religious family
02:40:51 does he support like the iron
02:40:53 woods or the other guys
02:40:55 from Dorn
02:40:57 you know like they've all got
02:40:59 all these associations with them
02:41:01 and it's there's just a lot
02:41:03 there's a lot of that stuff
02:41:05 and I feel stupid even
02:41:07 saying it like and it doesn't they had
02:41:09 cut it all from the show like like of course it doesn't
02:41:11 all make it into the show because the books are
02:41:13 like seven of them and they're each like
02:41:15 thousands of pages long
02:41:17 so like yeah the books are so dense
02:41:19 there's so much going on every page
02:41:21 genuinely so many words
02:41:23 there's so many wordles
02:41:25 it's like a fucking that that reminds
02:41:27 me they're making a fucking wheel of
02:41:29 time show
02:41:31 of those books
02:41:33 wheel of time
02:41:35 I remember that
02:41:37 I used to read those books when I was in
02:41:39 like sixth grade
02:41:41 I was I love that shit
02:41:43 I read a couple of them
02:41:45 and I just got too dense
02:41:47 the show looks kind of goofy
02:41:49 it looks kind of goofy kind of
02:41:51 a lot of CGI magic
02:41:53 sparkly stuff and I'm like
02:41:55 huh there's not the vibe I remember from the books
02:41:57 the books
02:41:59 I'm a little curious
02:42:03 wheel of time show
02:42:05 let me just find some screenshots here to
02:42:13 people in the woods
02:42:15 looks medieval
02:42:17 guys in white robes
02:42:21 I'm getting like nothing
02:42:23 I'm getting like no impression
02:42:25 of anything in these pictures
02:42:27 I feel nothing
02:42:29 okay never mind I've lost interest
02:42:31 exactly
02:42:33 the only adaptation of wheel of time
02:42:35 that is worth anything is the song
02:42:37 by blind guardian that song slaps
02:42:39 is it about
02:42:41 the books
02:42:43 yeah it's a song
02:42:45 blind guardian are like this like
02:42:47 symphonic like metal
02:42:49 I've heard blind guardian before
02:42:51 they made a song about wheel of time
02:42:53 and it's probably their best song
02:42:55 and one of the best
02:42:57 metal songs I've heard ever
02:42:59 it's really good
02:43:01 really good shit
02:43:03 I used to get so excited about
02:43:05 TV adaptations of like
02:43:07 things I had read and like oh dude
02:43:09 I can't wait there's gonna be the TV show
02:43:11 it's gonna be so epic now I'm like
02:43:13 I don't care or I actively dislike it
02:43:15 like recently why the last man is a comic
02:43:17 series I haven't read in a long time
02:43:19 I remember really enjoying it back in the day
02:43:21 oh for years I remember
02:43:23 oh I wish they'd make a show on this
02:43:25 oh I'd be so cool oh I wish they'd make a show on this
02:43:27 and like last year they made a show and I was like
02:43:29 whatever I didn't even watch it
02:43:31 they got cancelled after one season
02:43:33 I was hype as a child
02:43:35 when I heard they were making
02:43:37 an Animorphs TV series
02:43:39 and I don't know if you've ever seen the Animorphs TV series
02:43:41 it's like
02:43:43 legendarily shit
02:43:45 I can only imagine
02:43:47 it would be so hard to make a good animated
02:43:49 it would be so hard to make a good Animorphs show
02:43:51 I feel like
02:43:53 it didn't even look good as a kid
02:43:55 I can't I don't even want to see it as
02:43:57 an adult I'm like afraid of what it would
02:43:59 look like to my adult eyes
02:44:01 because I was in like third grade
02:44:03 for that shit
02:44:05 when was the first time you realized
02:44:07 as a kid that movies can be bad
02:44:11 I remember probably when I was like
02:44:13 three years old
02:44:15 it was the first time I watched the nostalgia cringe
02:44:17 yeah I liked everything I ever saw
02:44:19 until I had him explain to me
02:44:21 why it was bad
02:44:23 my bad credit card
02:44:25 oh god
02:44:27 I saw like Harry Potter
02:44:29 and Disney films and I was about it
02:44:31 I wouldn't really listen to movies
02:44:33 so I hadn't even been explaining
02:44:35 how terrible
02:44:37 have you guys seen kick assia
02:44:39 that's a great movie
02:44:41 that's legitimately
02:44:43 one of the worst movies I've ever seen
02:44:45 how many movies have you made
02:44:47 that's what I thought
02:44:49 the other ones are worse
02:44:51 kick assia is the best one he made
02:44:53 it's the first one right
02:44:55 because they get progressive
02:44:57 the second one was
02:44:59 suburban knights
02:45:01 that's one of the bullshot
02:45:03 that's one we can see is big fat bulls
02:45:05 oh kick assia I was thinking of kick ass
02:45:07 like the
02:45:09 luchin door superhero kid
02:45:11 oh yeah the real life superhero
02:45:13 this is the real shit
02:45:15 way better than that
02:45:17 the thing that sucks
02:45:19 about it is not even bad
02:45:21 in a funny way it's just bad
02:45:23 no it's legitimately good
02:45:25 I watch it every day
02:45:27 it's great insight
02:45:29 watch it like a documentary
02:45:31 you're actually seeing all these internet creators
02:45:33 they actually were like
02:45:35 they did this they were forced to do this
02:45:37 by Doug
02:45:39 they were forced to do this
02:45:41 a compelling cultural
02:45:43 artifact
02:45:45 a sort of proto
02:45:47 road to rad con
02:45:49 a sort of proto plebe in the wee blu-ray
02:45:51 is a movie like kick ass
02:45:53 now there's a pretty meme exquisite
02:45:55 hell yeah
02:45:57 something you look at and you're like
02:45:59 why
02:46:01 did anyone make this
02:46:03 what's the story and you look at it and you're like
02:46:05 I don't know just thinking about
02:46:07 you watch something like kick assia
02:46:09 which I haven't seen of course
02:46:11 but I can imagine
02:46:13 and you're not thinking about the story of the movie
02:46:15 you're thinking about like
02:46:17 oh there's that guy I know
02:46:19 him from the youtube
02:46:21 what is he feeling as he's being directed
02:46:23 by Doug Walker to do this fucking stupid shit
02:46:25 right now
02:46:27 that's what you're supposed to think
02:46:29 you can't get immersed in the world of the movie
02:46:31 it's impossible
02:46:33 it doesn't make any sense
02:46:35 and even a hack like Doug
02:46:37 probably didn't think anyone was gonna be
02:46:39 immersed in the story
02:46:41 he must have known
02:46:43 this is a stupid... I don't know about that one
02:46:45 I think he might have really thought he was making
02:46:47 a great movie
02:46:49 I feel like he knew
02:46:51 he was making a funny comedy
02:46:53 a funny comedy that's
02:46:55 somewhat
02:46:57 somewhat self aware about
02:46:59 its status as a sort of
02:47:01 weird artifact that exists to
02:47:03 bring all these internet content creators
02:47:05 together into a single
02:47:07 film
02:47:09 it's a hype moment
02:47:11 a legitimate hype moment for everyone who's fans of
02:47:13 all these people to see a crossover
02:47:15 it's a comedy movie and it's not taking itself too seriously
02:47:17 that's the first one
02:47:19 to boldly flee the last one
02:47:21 is way
02:47:23 more like sincere
02:47:25 it's a lore movie and Doug really thinks
02:47:27 this will be a great
02:47:29 magnuopus for his
02:47:31 nostalgia critic character and it's so
02:47:33 painful
02:47:35 that is absolutely right there's way more of
02:47:37 understanding that
02:47:39 kickass is a silly low budget
02:47:41 it's just like we're all on screen at the same time
02:47:43 isn't that funny
02:47:45 but by the third time they were doing it he was like
02:47:47 this is epic
02:47:49 you know what? fuck you
02:47:51 that's what phantom's revenge is
02:47:53 it's the ultimate send off
02:47:55 to a classic character
02:47:57 and fuck you if you don't think that's cool
02:47:59 is the game gonna suck?
02:48:01 there's no more voicemails
02:48:03 or else Lin's nostalgia critic
02:48:05 would have had to bring even more voicemail characters together
02:48:07 and take it too seriously
02:48:09 Ben saying that phantom home is the
02:48:11 to boldly flee no phantom home's revenge
02:48:13 is the to boldly flee of the slimy
02:48:15 punishment universe is not a good thing
02:48:17 it's a bold statement
02:48:19 I would absolutely describe it
02:48:21 as the to boldly flee
02:48:23 I hope the
02:48:25 final boss is the plot
02:48:27 you know what I mean
02:48:29 uh
02:48:31 the fucking first
02:48:33 movie I ever saw that I was like
02:48:35 oh what the fuck
02:48:37 bad movies exist
02:48:39 I don't actually remember how old I was
02:48:41 when it came out it was spy kids freedy
02:48:45 I saw it in theaters
02:48:47 and I'm like this is a movie made for me
02:48:49 how can you not like spy kids freedy? it has the guy in it
02:48:51 the guy
02:48:53 I didn't know who Frodo was
02:48:55 at the time
02:48:57 fair enough
02:48:59 I mean even aside from that
02:49:01 it was a funny scene
02:49:03 I just remember
02:49:05 here's my memory
02:49:07 I walk into the movie theater
02:49:09 I sit down
02:49:11 the fat kid breaks his piggy bank
02:49:13 on the floor
02:49:15 and then there's flashing lights and there's like a boxing glove that flies
02:49:17 out of the screen into my face
02:49:19 and then I walk out of the movie and I'm just completely
02:49:21 underwhelmed like
02:49:23 I didn't have fun
02:49:25 I feel like I had no fun at all
02:49:27 I think that happened
02:49:29 I feel like I was supposed to enjoy that
02:49:31 I think that happened with me with the second
02:49:33 Narnia movie I think it was
02:49:35 we went to cinema and saw that and I was like
02:49:37 oh this is uh
02:49:39 wait things can be bad
02:49:41 the first Narnia movie sucked
02:49:43 how old were you when Narnia?
02:49:45 I don't think I had even seen the first one
02:49:47 I had like yeah those fucking
02:49:49 old Narnia movies exist I remember
02:49:51 seeing one of my friends
02:49:53 the TV special
02:49:55 it was a TV special
02:49:57 the one from the 80s
02:49:59 I'm talking about the 2008 one
02:50:01 I know that's what you're talking about
02:50:03 that's why I said that one sucks
02:50:05 because the other one is
02:50:07 it has more hard but it's like the special effects
02:50:09 are awful and terrible
02:50:11 you've awakened the fucking memory in me
02:50:13 do you remember the beaver that looks
02:50:15 like a cylindrical
02:50:17 turd
02:50:19 I only saw one of them
02:50:21 it was I think it was based on the 7th book
02:50:23 or the one where if I go underground
02:50:25 or something there's like a character who like turns into a giant snake
02:50:27 and like it just fades
02:50:29 and there's like this fucking weird like
02:50:31 styrofoam like rubber cylinder
02:50:33 that's like supposed to be like
02:50:35 some monster and it just like flops on the floor
02:50:37 and I just remember laughing
02:50:39 so hard I was at a friend's house
02:50:41 I need to look up that clip holy fuck
02:50:43 I completely forgot about it
02:50:45 they never even made voyage of the Don
02:50:47 Treader the fucking cowards
02:50:49 they did
02:50:51 remember this one
02:50:53 that's the one I remember
02:50:55 they didn't make a movie out of it and I didn't watch it
02:50:57 well they didn't do it
02:50:59 with the old
02:51:01 with the old TV specials and that's how I wanted to see it
02:51:03 old TV specials
02:51:05 no look at her
02:51:07 they did it with a crappy nooster
02:51:09 I swear to god my parents
02:51:11 read me the Narnia books
02:51:13 when I was like a wee lad
02:51:15 I retained almost
02:51:17 zero knowledge of them
02:51:19 let me tell you the one
02:51:21 literally the one plot detail I remember
02:51:23 from all those books is there's a part
02:51:25 where like this little rat guy
02:51:27 gets on a boat
02:51:29 and then he like sails off to the edge of the world
02:51:31 and that's all I remember
02:51:33 voyage of the Don Treader
02:51:35 that's the only thing I remember from the entire series
02:51:37 no was he like a dwarf
02:51:39 wasn't there a
02:51:41 no there was a dwarf
02:51:43 yeah
02:51:45 he gets in a little
02:51:47 bucket or something
02:51:49 the ship can't go any further because
02:51:51 either going to the edge of the world
02:51:53 the sea becomes too shallow
02:51:55 and they're like we can't go any further
02:51:57 and the mouse is like I don't care
02:51:59 I'm gonna see the edge of the world or I'm gonna die trying
02:52:01 I'm gonna get in my little bucket and I'm just gonna keep going
02:52:03 see ya
02:52:05 I vaguely remember that
02:52:07 getting that part and I'm just like what the fuck
02:52:09 this is crazy
02:52:11 voyage of the Don Treader
02:52:13 fucking rules
02:52:15 my mom read me
02:52:17 specifically
02:52:19 the one about the line that was in the wardrobe
02:52:21 that was the only one we have
02:52:23 I do vaguely remember some from that one
02:52:25 that one's an iconic classic book
02:52:27 and then I got to school
02:52:29 and then we had a school library and I was like
02:52:31 wait there's more Narnia books
02:52:33 and I read them all
02:52:35 and they were great
02:52:37 some of them were better than others
02:52:39 voyage of the Don Treader is the best one
02:52:41 and yeah
02:52:43 Christian
02:52:45 that's why they call me Ben Saint
02:52:47 now it fucked me up forever
02:52:49 voyage of the Don Treader
02:52:51 I really really loved
02:52:53 I've read it like probably seven times
02:52:55 I've read all the books like at least five times
02:52:57 magicians nephew
02:52:59 I really like magicians nephew fucks
02:53:01 I love the fucking dying world with like the old
02:53:03 red giant son and shit
02:53:05 I like don't remember that one very well
02:53:07 I remember that one as being kind of the
02:53:09 boringest one
02:53:11 it was because I was too intellectual
02:53:13 for your young brain
02:53:15 I mean it probably was
02:53:17 I was probably like nine
02:53:19 so sure
02:53:21 why not
02:53:23 I just remember them going to this world that's like completely fucked up
02:53:25 and everything's dead and like the sun is about to explode
02:53:27 and there's just this fucking
02:53:29 there's this fucking bitch there who's just evil
02:53:31 and like trying to fuck everyone up
02:53:33 and it's great
02:53:35 there's a green ring
02:53:37 and a yellow ring
02:53:39 and they can go to a magical forest
02:53:41 with puddles in it
02:53:43 and that's one ring to rule the world
02:53:45 nooo
02:53:47 no no no
02:53:49 puddles
02:53:51 forest with puddles it's like a dimension
02:53:53 of portals
02:53:55 or something it's like
02:53:57 the puddle dimension that sounds like something from
02:53:59 fucking unicorn jelly
02:54:01 yeah it's like
02:54:03 the subtle knife
02:54:05 it's like the amber spyglass when they cut holes
02:54:07 in the dimension
02:54:09 oh yeah I remember those books
02:54:11 those were cool books
02:54:13 those were cool books
02:54:15 it kind of went off the rails as it went on
02:54:17 I like the second book the most
02:54:19 and then it just kind of got weird
02:54:21 the first one is all about
02:54:23 this one
02:54:25 this
02:54:27 the first one is like it like ends
02:54:29 with the revelation that like oh
02:54:31 actually like
02:54:33 this actually takes place in like a whole fucking
02:54:35 multiverse and like everything you have
02:54:37 sort of experience up until now
02:54:39 is kind of just like some bullshit that doesn't matter
02:54:41 and like
02:54:43 it's just one world among many and like fuck it
02:54:45 the real adventure starts now
02:54:47 and then the second book a bunch of crazy shit
02:54:49 happens and then the third one
02:54:51 is like we must kill
02:54:53 god and
02:54:55 you know
02:54:57 yeah it's just kind of strange from there
02:54:59 the weird the weird church shit
02:55:01 in the third book is like
02:55:03 stupid
02:55:05 it's like dumb I don't know
02:55:07 and then they have to
02:55:09 they kill god
02:55:11 they kill god and they destroy hell
02:55:13 and they kill the big angel
02:55:15 guy who's really bad
02:55:17 no they don't kill god
02:55:19 god's already dead
02:55:21 and he's worthless
02:55:23 and there's a but the angel
02:55:25 who is
02:55:27 basically god we kill him though
02:55:29 because he sucks
02:55:31 and the church is bad and we kill them too
02:55:33 and everyone dies
02:55:35 and they send him to hell but then we're like
02:55:37 fuck hell and then we kill the hell
02:55:39 wasn't he like a Christian though
02:55:41 so why would he say
02:55:43 no this isn't C.S. Lewis these books were written
02:55:45 by someone who's like I'm gonna be the
02:55:47 anti C.S. Lewis
02:55:49 I'm gonna like
02:55:51 do Narnia but I'm gonna make sin
02:55:53 is good and fuck god
02:55:55 can I actually do that because it sounds like
02:55:57 he might specifically have set out to do
02:55:59 exactly that
02:56:01 that book was called Shin Megami Tensei
02:56:03 my parents bought the books for me
02:56:05 my parents are Christians and
02:56:07 they knew that this was what the books were about
02:56:09 but they still bought them for me and said hey
02:56:11 just be aware this is what the offer is like
02:56:13 but apparently the books are good anyways so read them and I did
02:56:15 that's pretty damn nice
02:56:17 pretty chill parenting
02:56:19 considering most people in America are like
02:56:21 Harry Potter is the devil it'll make you Satan
02:56:23 my parents were like fat like when I was really
02:56:25 little and then they got over it
02:56:27 cause they went to university and like studied
02:56:29 religion and were like oh yeah never mind
02:56:31 there's literally no reason to be against
02:56:33 that shit
02:56:35 genuinely the
02:56:37 his dark materials is just like a very
02:56:39 his dark materials
02:56:41 is that what I said?
02:56:43 yeah yes that's correct you just I'm just like saying it
02:56:45 cause you awakened memory
02:56:47 yeah I was trying to remember it's like wait
02:56:49 Amber spyglass, subtle knife
02:56:51 uh
02:56:53 no first one is golden compass
02:56:55 golden compass, subtle knife, amber spyglass
02:56:57 and the whole set is called his dark materials
02:56:59 the el-theometer
02:57:01 yes yes the el-ethiometer
02:57:03 they dumbed it down on the title
02:57:05 I think the first book in English
02:57:07 is just called the northern lights
02:57:09 yeah it is it is called the northern lights
02:57:11 well that sucked I remember reading
02:57:13 yeah that sucked
02:57:15 that sucked shit
02:57:17 that fucking sucked ass and was terrible
02:57:19 okay well in America
02:57:21 in America they called the book
02:57:23 in America they called the book the golden compass
02:57:25 uh
02:57:27 America always gets the dumb titles
02:57:29 no northern lights fucking sucks
02:57:31 the sorcerers don't
02:57:33 children can't know what a
02:57:35 philosopher is
02:57:37 okay yeah
02:57:39 that sucks obviously sorcerers
02:57:41 don't sucks
02:57:43 but uh the
02:57:45 northern lights doesn't even sound
02:57:47 like it's about like a journey to the fucking arctic circle
02:57:49 it does not sound like
02:57:51 it's about
02:57:53 yeah voraborealis
02:57:55 or in this kind of book
02:57:57 she she walked into the northern lights
02:57:59 and was transported to another dimension
02:58:01 delightfully devilish
02:58:03 delightfully devilish
02:58:05 delightfully devilish
02:58:07 the author of the author was like
02:58:09 he sat down and he's like
02:58:11 fuck C.S. Lewis I'm gonna get a little
02:58:13 delightfully devilish with my
02:58:15 with my work of secular humanism
02:58:17 but what if
02:58:19 I were to take Narnia and reverse the thematic
02:58:21 that would be
02:58:23 you remind me of a funny
02:58:25 story from my childhood now regarding
02:58:27 steamed hams and literature
02:58:29 those two things overlapped in my childhood
02:58:31 what if I made God an old bitch
02:58:33 and disguised it as a work of
02:58:35 something else
02:58:39 delightfully devilish
02:58:41 I have to tell this story it's funny
02:58:43 when I was um
02:58:45 I was probably like 10 I was probably 10 or 11
02:58:47 I saw that episode of the Simpsons and I love steamed hams
02:58:49 me and my sister were like quoting at each other
02:58:51 all the time we thought it was so fucking funny
02:58:53 we thought it was the funniest fucking thing
02:58:55 we even taped the episode on VHS
02:58:57 with a blank videotape and rewatched it a bunch of times
02:58:59 and then
02:59:01 and then I had a creative writing assignment at school
02:59:03 I was at a tiny school there were literally
02:59:05 four students after me and my sister
02:59:07 joined and then later there were like seven students
02:59:09 it was the tiniest fucking school you've ever seen
02:59:11 and for my creative writing assignment
02:59:13 I just transcribed steamed hams
02:59:15 from memory and I failed
02:59:19 you should have
02:59:21 for plagiarism
02:59:23 did your teacher know what it was
02:59:25 I don't even know if I did
02:59:27 I don't think they did
02:59:29 her name was Mrs. King
02:59:31 she was like the oldest
02:59:33 fuddy deadiest woman you could ever imagine
02:59:35 she fought everything
02:59:37 was a swear word
02:59:39 like ass
02:59:41 some people like you don't like the word ass
02:59:43 well she didn't like the word butt
02:59:45 and she didn't even like the word bum
02:59:47 that was considered a swear word
02:59:49 I know what you mean there's these old people who can't handle
02:59:51 they can't even handle the soft swear words
02:59:53 they can't even handle the soft swear word bum
02:59:55 you have to say bottom
02:59:57 and that's the only acceptable word as one example
02:59:59 what exactly
03:00:01 was the assignment that you were like I know
03:00:03 I'll just transcribe steamed hams
03:00:05 from memory and that will be
03:00:07 that will satisfy my instructor
03:00:09 it was just like write a short story
03:00:11 that was all it was
03:00:13 alright Mrs. King I have my
03:00:15 short story here it's called
03:00:17 who's on first
03:00:19 I'm trying to imagine
03:00:21 yeah exactly I'm trying to imagine
03:00:23 if I was like a first grade teacher
03:00:25 or whatever and like
03:00:27 I assigned my kids that
03:00:29 and one of them hands it back and they've just
03:00:31 they've written steamed hams
03:00:33 I knew you transcribed it
03:00:35 it was like principal Seymour
03:00:37 Skinner who says this like
03:00:39 character names and everything
03:00:41 I basically just like
03:00:43 when me and my sister would just quote it at each other
03:00:45 it was just that
03:00:47 so it was like nonsensical it wasn't like written
03:00:49 so it wasn't like
03:00:51 it was just like the sentences they say to each other
03:00:53 written in a sequence
03:00:55 and like maybe a description here of air
03:00:57 but mostly just for sentences yeah
03:00:59 just the dialogue
03:01:01 I'm trying to decide
03:01:03 that like she must she just genuinely thought it was bad
03:01:05 or did you just
03:01:07 like do a bad job transcribing
03:01:09 I definitely did a fucking bad job
03:01:11 I did not know how to spell a roar
03:01:13 so it's not that like
03:01:15 so it's not that she was like
03:01:17 so it can't be that she was like a first
03:01:19 grader didn't write this this is a work of comedic genius
03:01:21 this is like that this is
03:01:23 this is this is this is national
03:01:25 yeah it's like
03:01:27 it mentioned your to your child's
03:01:29 hands in like a professional like
03:01:31 mean writer level comedy scene
03:01:33 yeah it's just
03:01:35 it's just a steam of
03:01:37 consciousness if you will
03:01:39 nonsense you know I just
03:01:41 want to go on record the people sometimes will groan
03:01:43 when you make an aurora borealis reference now because
03:01:45 that scene was memed like to high heaven
03:01:47 and back but just for the record
03:01:49 that scene is still incredibly funny
03:01:51 I was so glad when it became a meme
03:01:53 it was already in my life
03:01:55 it was not one of the simpson scenes
03:01:57 that I like quoted all the time
03:01:59 as a kid I mean it was it was
03:02:01 a funny scene that I was great
03:02:03 but it wasn't it wasn't like that whole episode
03:02:05 the whole like all the short stories and stuff like
03:02:07 28 short films about springfield yeah
03:02:09 yeah it's a classic
03:02:11 I only saw that one like
03:02:13 once as a kid I didn't
03:02:15 it wasn't one that I like remembered that
03:02:17 well I thought I remember
03:02:19 thinking that it was weird oh you know
03:02:21 I mean I hadn't seen
03:02:23 what do you call it pulp fiction and like
03:02:25 half of that episode is like a pulp fiction reference
03:02:27 and I didn't get it because there's some very
03:02:29 explicit references to pulp fiction
03:02:31 I heard of pulp fiction because
03:02:33 my dad said it was a bad movie
03:02:35 and the director was just
03:02:37 trying to be too cool by doing things out of order
03:02:39 stop trying to be cool you're not cool
03:02:41 that's why
03:02:43 I love that reaction some people go like
03:02:45 they get offended when you try and like do things
03:02:47 in like you know non chronological order
03:02:49 they're like just fucking put it in chronological order
03:02:51 stop trying to be fucking smart
03:02:53 my dad's favorite movie is braveheart
03:02:55 and character has like a moral
03:02:57 like takes a moral stand
03:02:59 or something or makes a sacrifice or whatever the fuck
03:03:01 I mean alright
03:03:03 sure I don't know
03:03:05 he's just a guy that likes a good default movie
03:03:07 I can't blame him my dad's favorite movie
03:03:09 is planes trains and all the wheels because he likes funny things
03:03:11 I have never seen
03:03:13 I have never seen that it's a good movie
03:03:15 my name's fun mum has
03:03:17 I think I've seen that never watched a movie more
03:03:19 than once except for the matrix
03:03:21 she's like never watched a movie
03:03:23 it's like me
03:03:25 it's probably not that uncommon
03:03:27 but it feels weird to me
03:03:29 I like never rewatch movies like I never re-read books
03:03:31 I just didn't do it
03:03:33 I'm a re-watcher I'll re-watch things
03:03:35 I've seen office space literally like
03:03:37 a hundred times
03:03:39 I think the thing that I have probably re-watched the most
03:03:41 times in my life is Fooley Cooley
03:03:43 and I've probably seen it maybe like six times
03:03:45 only six times
03:03:47 that's good that one's nice and short too
03:03:49 Fooley Cooley is basically a movie
03:03:51 not even as a kid when you only had like
03:03:53 ten movies on VHS
03:03:55 and that's all you had and you just watched them all the time
03:03:57 okay
03:03:59 I re-watched stuff a lot less
03:04:01 than I used to
03:04:03 when I was younger
03:04:05 I mean I'm trying to think
03:04:07 if there was stuff that I watched
03:04:09 or replayed games or whatever
03:04:11 I didn't really have anything that I would
03:04:13 re-watch all the time
03:04:15 as a kid
03:04:17 how much treasure planet films suddenly as a kid
03:04:19 and that is a cool movie
03:04:21 I just kind of watched every movie that we had
03:04:23 re-watch a bunch because we didn't have a lot
03:04:25 and we didn't have good television
03:04:27 it's just weird that like kids today
03:04:29 never have to re-watch anything if they don't want to
03:04:31 they'll just go on their little phone or tablet
03:04:33 and you know you can see an infinite supply of
03:04:35 new content but easily
03:04:37 I re-watch YouTube videos at the time too though
03:04:39 yeah me too there's plenty of YouTube videos I go back to
03:04:41 I could not tell you how many times
03:04:43 I've seen
03:04:45 Rolling Rocks with A-Press
03:04:47 you know what I mean?
03:04:49 I've seen that like three times
03:04:51 you know what actually yeah
03:04:53 you didn't know about Darth Vader's suit
03:04:55 oh my god dude Simzi Simzi that video is
03:04:57 fucking amazing
03:04:59 there are a bunch of
03:05:01 there are a bunch of
03:05:03 I've listened to like
03:05:05 I've listened to all of Jenny Nicholson's
03:05:07 videos multiple times
03:05:09 just for instance
03:05:11 she has some really good ones
03:05:13 she has really good ones
03:05:15 when I was editing the PCP
03:05:17 last week I was grabbing clips from
03:05:19 Journey of the Spark right for that segment
03:05:21 where I talked about it
03:05:23 in the
03:05:25 one of the credit sequences Jenny Nicholson was voicing
03:05:27 Rainbow Dash
03:05:29 in Journey of the Spark I forgot about that
03:05:31 really? yeah it's funny that she was
03:05:33 so in the Brony like her Brony
03:05:35 community like dissection video
03:05:37 was really interesting
03:05:39 I worked with Jenny Nicholson on a few projects
03:05:41 I worked on Friendship as Witchcraft
03:05:43 that was one of the few videos from her I watched
03:05:45 she was
03:05:47 she was the voice
03:05:49 of Kagan Phantom's mom
03:05:51 in Phantom Reviews
03:05:53 Hearth's Warming Eve
03:05:55 she did a voice
03:05:57 she has one line
03:05:59 at the very beginning of that video
03:06:01 LeMau
03:06:03 oh and then she did
03:06:05 because we put Kimmy Sparkle
03:06:07 in one of the
03:06:09 the
03:06:11 music the song video
03:06:13 the cutie mark for Fuffle videos
03:06:15 and she voiced
03:06:17 two lines from Kimmy Sparkle
03:06:19 I did an animation of Kimmy Sparkle
03:06:21 like bursting into flames
03:06:23 and dying horrifically
03:06:25 it was going to be in that
03:06:27 I live Compossible a lot animation about John Delancey
03:06:29 because I was on that project as well
03:06:31 why wasn't it?
03:06:33 they cut it out
03:06:35 why?
03:06:37 fuck off
03:06:39 we sent it to Jenny
03:06:41 and she loved it
03:06:43 and when I met her at Fiesta Choir 2014
03:06:45 she was like oh my god you animated that thing
03:06:47 and was like super
03:06:49 like happy about it
03:06:51 which was cool
03:06:53 when I met Jenny
03:06:55 at the last Bronycon
03:06:57 we were walking
03:06:59 because there were like two buildings
03:07:01 and we were going to a room in the secondary
03:07:03 building
03:07:05 so we had to pass through a sky bridge
03:07:07 and I was walking towards the sky bridge
03:07:09 and I was just unsure where to go
03:07:11 and I had just made up my mind
03:07:13 I'm going to ask the next person I see
03:07:15 like is this the way to the building
03:07:17 and it just so happened that the person that walked out
03:07:19 of the sky bridge was Jenny Nicholson
03:07:21 with like two other people
03:07:23 and I was like oh okay
03:07:25 so I asked her like hey
03:07:27 is this the way to the building
03:07:29 and she was like yep it's right through there
03:07:31 and I was like okay cool
03:07:33 and then I kept walking
03:07:35 and then Nicholson's met Ben St
03:07:37 yeah right
03:07:39 you jealous of her
03:07:41 yeah
03:07:43 you should hear her tell that story
03:07:45 when she's like can you believe the time Ben St walked up to me
03:07:47 and asked me where the sky bridge was
03:07:49 I was like holy shit
03:07:51 so I was just going to keep going
03:07:53 but then like the part
03:07:55 because I was like at the front of the pack
03:07:57 like other people were behind me
03:07:59 Nate was back there and Michelle
03:08:01 and I think a bunch of the other people we were
03:08:03 to be like oh hey I'm
03:08:05 you know I
03:08:07 we're these people we talked to you this one time
03:08:09 and like he had a whole
03:08:11 I'm keg!
03:08:13 I didn't hear what he said because I was a bit too far away
03:08:15 but I turned around and I was kind of like
03:08:17 I saw him like schmoozing and I was like
03:08:19 yeah alright
03:08:21 like I get it but also like
03:08:23 we were in a hurry like we're going somewhere
03:08:25 we're going to a panel
03:08:27 but I didn't interrupt
03:08:29 he bit you went I made the weapon
03:08:31 you always thickness me remember
03:08:33 but I didn't interrupt because I was like
03:08:35 yeah yeah alright it's Jenny Nicholson
03:08:37 you got to talk to Jenny Nicholson I get it
03:08:39 uh
03:08:41 but then uh yeah so
03:08:43 that's the story of how I met Jenny Nicholson
03:08:45 in BronyCon LeMau
03:08:47 I remember that
03:08:49 I think I was next to Nate
03:08:51 I barely have seen her videos
03:08:53 but I knew her from being
03:08:55 Kimmy Sparkle
03:08:57 and from Friendship is Witchcraft
03:08:59 I never watched that
03:09:01 really are you
03:09:03 I always meant to
03:09:05 but because I never
03:09:07 ever ever
03:09:09 look or watch or read or play anything that I say
03:09:11 I'm going to get around to that
03:09:13 I never did
03:09:15 you didn't have
03:09:17 you didn't have context for Pinky's Brew
03:09:21 nope
03:09:23 I mean I know that it's a song where she's
03:09:25 like a gypsy making a potion
03:09:27 Pinky's Brew and what's the other one
03:09:29 what's the other one about
03:09:31 the other Pinky song
03:09:33 Gypsy Bard
03:09:35 Gypsy Bard and Pinky's Brew
03:09:37 yeah
03:09:39 which I guess you're not supposed to say those words anymore
03:09:41 I fucking
03:09:43 I fucking

03:09:53 she said
03:09:55 in her video that like
03:09:57 you know it's a slur
03:09:59 and it's like okay but like
03:10:01 it's the name of the song and like
03:10:03 kids on tiktok sing it and they sing the words

03:10:23 you you animated that
03:10:25 part of it
03:10:27 yes I did
03:10:29 I did not know that
03:10:31 yeah I've been around
03:10:33 I had no
03:10:35 okay I've
03:10:37 wow I like I had the feeling like I've always
03:10:39 known that like some guest
03:10:41 artists like someone like made that section
03:10:43 and that was you it was you
03:10:45 this whole time the song
03:10:47 I animated it in like exposed
03:10:49 two days or something
03:10:51 it'll be okay
03:10:53 wow all right every time oblivion
03:10:55 full speaks he reveals a new
03:10:57 great secret link
03:10:59 to some other thing
03:11:01 always some kind of plot twist
03:11:03 that's uh that's just so fucked
03:11:05 up man that's just so
03:11:07 twisted it is so fucked up
03:11:09 it's twisted
03:11:11 it turns out
03:11:13 it was just oblivion full
03:11:15 yeah I think
03:11:17 so I think so yeah
03:11:19 true sad but true
03:11:21 you make all those puppets
03:11:23 you're puppeteering everyone
03:11:25 dude I get messages all the time I never have to
03:11:27 advertise my commissions
03:11:29 like ever like I get like a few messages
03:11:31 a week and now from people being like
03:11:33 hey do you still do those vectors and if I
03:11:35 want if I feel like it if they have a really
03:11:37 easy design I'll just be like sure
03:11:39 and then I get like a hundred bucks and then I knock it out
03:11:41 in a few hours
03:11:43 there's still demand for pony vectors huh
03:11:45 yeah there are
03:11:47 I get people I thought all
03:11:49 any and all pony fandom would
03:11:51 be stomped out forcefully
03:11:53 to make way for the new brony fandom
03:11:55 for the new generation of the show
03:11:57 no they'll never die
03:11:59 does anyone even care about the new generation
03:12:01 did it start I can't remember
03:12:03 yeah the new the new generation
03:12:05 okay but the new generation like
03:12:07 kind of acknowledges the old generation
03:12:09 and it like doesn't really invalidate it
03:12:11 so like you can bronies the next
03:12:13 generation there's there's no conflict
03:12:15 in being like a g a g
03:12:17 a g4 brony
03:12:19 and like being into
03:12:21 the new the new
03:12:23 one like you can a smooth
03:12:25 smooth transition of power
03:12:27 there's no problem with being a g4
03:12:29 brony but if you're one of those fucking g1
03:12:31 grandmas we're gonna fucking kill you
03:12:33 wow
03:12:35 yeah that's my sister dude my
03:12:37 grandma literally
03:12:39 she's dead now but I growing up
03:12:41 I knew her as one of the biggest
03:12:43 my little pony collectors in the united states
03:12:45 like I would go in her basement there was
03:12:47 like a wall of these fucking ponies
03:12:49 so I was always just
03:12:51 so to you my little pony with grandma
03:12:53 the ponies were fine
03:12:55 I'm a little curious did she have anything
03:12:57 to say about the brony phenomenon
03:12:59 I'm a little brony curious
03:13:01 I asked her about the
03:13:03 brony thing she died in like 2015
03:13:05 or something so she wasn't like she
03:13:07 didn't fully she didn't get to fully experience it which is
03:13:09 can you think of a greater casual life and being a
03:13:11 little pony fan and not getting to experience
03:13:13 friendship is magic
03:13:15 wait friendship is magic came out
03:13:17 in like 2010 though that
03:13:19 surely was a lot of time
03:13:21 yeah sorry I
03:13:23 she was contemporaneously surviving with it
03:13:25 I just never asked her about it I don't think she was ever
03:13:27 like she never talked about the new show or anything
03:13:29 she was a big fan but she was a big closeted
03:13:31 brony like she didn't tell you about it
03:13:33 she never
03:13:35 she never lived to see twilight
03:13:37 grow into a long legged giant
03:13:39 horse freak princess creature
03:13:41 she didn't get to finish it is what I was saying
03:13:43 she lived just long enough to see horseshoe finale
03:13:45 on her death
03:13:47 that's what she could check out
03:13:49 I don't know anything about what you're talking about
03:13:51 does she grow into a long
03:13:53 freaky monster
03:13:55 do you know princess celestia
03:13:57 no
03:13:59 okay well she's got a long neck
03:14:01 the princess
03:14:03 princess celestia is the ruler
03:14:05 of the horses but she's like a big
03:14:07 horse like she's just bigger and longer
03:14:09 than all the other horses and at the end
03:14:11 of the series twilight sparkle
03:14:13 fucking pokemon evolves
03:14:15 and grows up into a long
03:14:17 freak like celestia
03:14:19 only big boys
03:14:21 can be in charge of society
03:14:23 that's the message it's literally it's the
03:14:25 it's the almighty tallest from invader
03:14:27 zim that's the rule
03:14:29 it literally is
03:14:31 that's funny is it like in dark souls
03:14:33 how the more powerful you are the bigger you are
03:14:35 yes yes
03:14:37 yes it is
03:14:39 precisely like that
03:14:41 almost all of my
03:14:43 pony knowledge besides from like
03:14:45 watching a jenny tekelson video on that brony
03:14:47 thing comes from just like memes
03:14:49 and animation memes I've seen from like two
03:14:51 snacks you know the cool animation guy
03:14:53 there's some pretty
03:14:55 high quality animation
03:14:57 stuff out there for brony's
03:14:59 okay two snacks is probably most known
03:15:01 for his vtuber stuff now like the eco vocal
03:15:03 thing it's that guy
03:15:05 animations that were popular
03:15:07 in the early brony fandom
03:15:09 my brony knowledge comes from
03:15:11 asking ben and gibb things when I talk to them
03:15:13 oh god
03:15:15 as soon as he said the eco vocal thing I knew
03:15:17 that's not actually from the show but it's
03:15:19 approximately what she looks like
03:15:21 that's freaky
03:15:23 yeah she went through the fucking
03:15:25 junji ito cave hole
03:15:27 I want to see her kill someone with that horn
03:15:29 I think I've seen taller ponies
03:15:31 before but I just assumed that they were
03:15:33 adults and everyone else was kids
03:15:35 no the god queen
03:15:37 of ponies is long and everyone
03:15:39 else is a little
03:15:41 is a little marshmallow
03:15:43 and squeaky and small
03:15:45 and a twilight sparkle grows up to become
03:15:47 queen of the ponies and the
03:15:49 old queen I guess dies
03:15:51 or like retires to some
03:15:53 she retires to a beach
03:15:55 do they not show her getting small
03:15:57 does she get small once she leaves the power
03:15:59 no I don't think we ever see
03:16:01 what becomes of princess celestia
03:16:03 she presumably just goes away from her
03:16:05 you think small luna
03:16:07 could they coronate every
03:16:11 could they coronate every member of the
03:16:13 community and make them all tall and then
03:16:15 everybody gets to be tall probably not
03:16:17 because twilight was able to become
03:16:19 this creature through a
03:16:21 fucking like
03:16:23 magical confluence
03:16:25 of like mystical
03:16:27 knowledge and it's probably
03:16:29 like a once in a lifetime miraculous
03:16:31 event that will never be
03:16:33 sorry main character is only
03:16:35 so she's the chosen one
03:16:39 a little bit
03:16:41 is she the reincarnation of
03:16:43 the son of the sage of
03:16:45 six paths
03:16:47 that's a narrator
03:16:49 that's right
03:16:51 applejack gif
03:16:53 his awakening memory is holy fuck I remember
03:16:55 it
03:16:57 remember when Naruto made a big frog
03:16:59 appear okay okay
03:17:01 that was great
03:17:03 that was great that was a
03:17:05 pretty cool
03:17:07 cyber shell did you ever see one called
03:17:09 um oh god what was
03:17:11 was it um
03:17:13 the one the one where celestia
03:17:15 is like you're a bitch who likes bananas
03:17:17 you know that one
03:17:19 oh my god
03:17:21 triggering some neurons in my brain
03:17:23 I don't remember what it was called
03:17:25 you're a bitch who likes
03:17:27 bananas you're a bitch who likes
03:17:29 bananas
03:17:31 I got a fucking
03:17:33 t-shirt from my sister that
03:17:35 had a meme referencing that on it
03:17:37 that specific video
03:17:39 that was the shit now that
03:17:41 was the shit back in the day
03:17:43 whoa that frog is so huge
03:17:45 what the fuck it's a really big frog
03:17:47 I saw a thread
03:17:49 I saw a thread on twitter
03:17:51 I found the video
03:17:53 oh yeah friendship is magic bitch there it is
03:17:55 there it is I mean it's a great video
03:17:57 it's really funny
03:17:59 I saw a thread
03:18:01 it is
03:18:03 I saw a thread on twitter about a guy
03:18:05 who found a green
03:18:07 tree frog in his romaine
03:18:09 lettuce from whole foods
03:18:11 and it just lived
03:18:13 like he just
03:18:15 he bought romaine lettuce from whole foods
03:18:17 and he
03:18:19 just it was in his fridge for like days
03:18:21 and he pulled it out
03:18:23 and he pulled out some romaine lettuce
03:18:25 and there was just a green tree frog
03:18:27 living in his refrigerator
03:18:29 the whole time
03:18:31 and he's just one of those fridge
03:18:33 frogs you know
03:18:35 he made it his pet
03:18:37 it briefly escaped but he found it
03:18:39 he found it crawling around his door frame
03:18:41 so you know
03:18:43 he got it an actual like terrarium
03:18:45 and he named it toby
03:18:47 and uh
03:18:49 that's the story now he's his pet frog
03:18:51 that's a good
03:18:53 free frog
03:18:55 did he say to the frog you seem chill
03:18:59 you seem chill you could stay bro
03:19:01 I get it
03:19:03 I get it
03:19:05 I don't
03:19:07 I guess because he was in the fridge
03:19:09 wouldn't he die in the fridge
03:19:11 because he's cold-blooded
03:19:13 like don't frogs don't cold-blooded creatures
03:19:15 need to not be in the cold
03:19:17 or they die?
03:19:19 I thought it would just slow down his metabolism
03:19:21 and like help him survive honestly
03:19:23 but maybe
03:19:25 he wraps up in a little lettuce blanket
03:19:27 I mean being cold-blooded means they can be cold-blooded
03:19:29 it means they want their blood to be warmed
03:19:31 by like the sun and stuff but like
03:19:33 it would be worse if he was warm-blooded
03:19:35 and then he locked him in the fridge because then he would definitely die
03:19:37 I thought when you're cold-blooded
03:19:39 you need heat
03:19:41 or you die whereas like if you're warm-blooded
03:19:43 you can generate your own heat
03:19:45 I thought it was like that
03:19:47 am I crazy?
03:19:49 I don't think reptiles are real
03:19:51 I think it was just a conspiracy
03:19:53 I mean yeah the reptiles are the government
03:19:55 really
03:19:57 those are the real reptiles
03:19:59 what Simsie what is this?
03:20:01 you seem chill
03:20:03 it's just an image I really like
03:20:05 I love the
03:20:07 yeah the HD trailer and just the horrible
03:20:09 JPEG artifacts
03:20:11 they're so funny but they are sometimes
03:20:13 dude I'm manually painting JPEG artifacts
03:20:15 cause it looks like you got it from your grandma's facebook
03:20:17 yeah
03:20:19 do you actually have live info?
03:20:21 I did
03:20:23 I did a fake
03:20:25 a fake picture
03:20:27 of me like
03:20:29 what do you call that pose
03:20:31 like that meditation pose where your legs are crossed
03:20:33 and you're like
03:20:35 doing a thing
03:20:37 I don't know
03:20:39 my legs crossed and I was like floating off the floor
03:20:41 and I was supporting myself
03:20:43 with just my two pointer fingers
03:20:45 and the image was fake I was actually sitting
03:20:47 on a
03:20:49 like a box like a fire proof box
03:20:51 or something
03:20:53 and I photoshopped it out by
03:20:55 instead of taking a picture I actually ran a video
03:20:57 where I sat in that position
03:20:59 on the box with my fingers on the floor
03:21:01 and then I stood up and walked away
03:21:03 and removed the box so that there's like
03:21:05 an empty background
03:21:07 different frames of the video
03:21:09 I gotcha
03:21:11 it helps to do that on the video
03:21:13 I was doing a whole Captain Disillusion thing
03:21:15 I was just gonna say
03:21:17 I looked too clean
03:21:19 so I got a green and blue brush
03:21:21 and just painted in little like squary little things
03:21:23 around it to make it look more JPEG-y
03:21:25 and that made it more convincing
03:21:27 yes absolutely crushing your
03:21:29 like removing quality somehow
03:21:31 like makes things more believable sometimes
03:21:33 which is weird to think about but yeah
03:21:35 I was just watching some Captain D
03:21:37 the other day I watched
03:21:39 the one about playing in traffic
03:21:41 he's a great
03:21:43 Tuber for sure and he's one of those guys
03:21:45 that's been doing it for like 10 years
03:21:47 and like go back and watch his early videos
03:21:49 or yeah this is one longer than 10
03:21:51 it's been longer than 10
03:21:53 2007
03:21:55 it hurts my brain to think that there are
03:21:57 YouTube videos that have been up for like 15 years
03:21:59 but you're absolutely right the point I was just trying to say is that
03:22:01 go back and watch his earliest stuff and it's not like
03:22:03 shitty it's still good stuff it's still good
03:22:05 it's like exactly the same
03:22:07 the highest quality that YouTube could support
03:22:09 at the time which is like 240p
03:22:11 well the interesting thing about those old videos
03:22:13 is that if you watch from now they're actually
03:22:15 16x9
03:22:17 which is interesting
03:22:19 because most videos from back then people would add
03:22:21 the black bars at the bottom and then
03:22:23 when we got widescreen there'd be extra
03:22:25 black bars so there's just black bars
03:22:27 on all sides he avoided that
03:22:29 he did like some weird
03:22:31 like codec
03:22:33 he injected some code into the upload
03:22:35 that made it so that it was
03:22:37 properly 16x9 and when YouTube
03:22:39 upgraded the video got formatted correctly
03:22:41 and he's the only fucking person
03:22:43 who did that that I'm aware of
03:22:45 that's insane
03:22:47 that is pretty cool
03:22:49 I don't even know how he fucking did that but he had the foresight to do that somehow
03:22:51 what the fuck
03:22:53 I know YouTube allows different video resolutions
03:22:55 I know I've seen some shitposts that are just
03:22:57 very very very wide
03:22:59 but doing that shit back in the day was very impressive
03:23:01 yeah back then no you had to
03:23:03 it was just like fucking
03:23:07 quote unquote standard resolution right
03:23:13 god damn that's
03:23:15 I sometimes wonder if he ever regrets doing the
03:23:17 face paint thing because it's very cool
03:23:19 branding and it's recognizable and
03:23:21 it's probably just a huge pain in the ass
03:23:23 cause he can't stop doing it now
03:23:25 I'm sure he's had moments like that
03:23:27 but his face though
03:23:29 it's so distinct like you gotta have a visual
03:23:31 brand like nah
03:23:33 no I like it I'm not at all
03:23:35 I'm sure he like
03:23:37 you know it's like this is a pretty good
03:23:39 you know it's a brand
03:23:41 it's iconic I can't like stop it
03:23:43 but like
03:23:45 I feel like he has mentioned that it's like
03:23:47 it's very tedious and it doesn't help
03:23:49 when he's trying to like be punctual
03:23:51 with like a fad
03:23:53 and try to make a video about it
03:23:55 when he's gonna do all of this work and editing
03:23:57 and like 3D work on it
03:23:59 that too god yeah
03:24:01 you can't just do a retake because you'd have to like
03:24:03 you can't do a retake but like you know he has to do the
03:24:05 make up every time he wants to do it
03:24:07 how long do you think it would take him to get his make up done
03:24:09 like he can't be that bad
03:24:11 he's probably pretty good at it now
03:24:13 he's gonna go down to like 40 minutes or something
03:24:15 that's still a long fucking time at least for me
03:24:17 40 minutes
03:24:19 that's just me going off memory
03:24:21 you can't just slap that shit on your face
03:24:23 especially like the black part like you know
03:24:25 he does a good job
03:24:27 apparently like he's gone faster at it
03:24:29 I mean 40 minutes ish is what I remember
03:24:31 hearing but I could be wrong
03:24:33 I mean looking at that even if he was twice as fast
03:24:35 even if he only took him 20 minutes that's still 20 minutes
03:24:37 that'd be such a pain in the ass dude
03:24:39 I'm just lazy as fuck because I thought of doing that
03:24:41 is so like horrifying to me
03:24:43 I had seen I had seen
03:24:45 Captain D's face
03:24:47 like I've been seeing his face for a long time
03:24:49 and only like this year did I like
03:24:51 find out like what he does
03:24:53 and like what his videos are about
03:24:55 yeah I only got into him
03:24:57 it was a couple years ago for me
03:24:59 but like yeah I somehow managed to like
03:25:01 you know there's a million people on YouTube
03:25:03 he can't really be in touch with every popular creator on YouTube
03:25:05 but like he's really he's very popular
03:25:07 and like he makes good videos
03:25:09 I would recommend him to like pretty much anyone
03:25:11 so like I'm just surprised I agree like how did I not find him earlier
03:25:13 and I still found out about him a couple years ago
03:25:15 so I was just like damn I felt the same way
03:25:17 I watched the one about laminar flow
03:25:19 and I was like damn why didn't anybody tell me to watch this before
03:25:21 this is great
03:25:23 yeah like I've never even heard of him
03:25:25 until just now so
03:25:27 check out his channel there's some good stuff on there
03:25:29 yeah I'm looking at it it didn't start getting well known
03:25:31 until like 2015
03:25:33 the first one I saw was the portal
03:25:35 to like Sedona or whatever that weird thing was
03:25:37 which is like you know I've always sort of like
03:25:39 enjoyed a good debunk video but like
03:25:41 his like special effects videos are the real
03:25:43 ream of the crop that's the stuff I really like
03:25:45 yeah yeah for sure
03:25:47 I always tell everyone to watch for one about the tape measure
03:25:49 because he just edits himself
03:25:51 oh that was so good
03:25:53 he removes the special effects
03:25:55 and he edits himself into the shot
03:25:57 setting up the special effects and like the wire rigs
03:25:59 and stuff and I'm like how the fuck dude
03:26:01 the other day
03:26:03 that one rules the other day I watched
03:26:05 the one about
03:26:07 it was a short one about
03:26:09 the trophy in the Great British Bake Off
03:26:11 you see that one and how they
03:26:13 oh yeah that's a good new one
03:26:15 I like that
03:26:17 I watched that I was like I can't fucking
03:26:19 believe he could just do that
03:26:21 I can't fucking believe this is real
03:26:23 that's another example of Americans
03:26:25 that was like a legal thing or something but like
03:26:27 American titles being stupid
03:26:29 very stupid very fucking stupid
03:26:31 we can't call it a bake off we have to call it like the cooking
03:26:33 the baking show or something like that
03:26:35 because Nestle owns the phrase Bake Off
03:26:37 I'm so stupid
03:26:39 fucking Nestle
03:26:41 is it Nestle it might not be Nestle
03:26:43 it was some I think it was
03:26:45 it was some company
03:26:47 someone owns the phrase
03:26:49 to bake off which is stupid in and of itself
03:26:51 terrible
03:26:53 nightmare
03:26:55 yeah
03:26:57 I think maybe I just checked and I just watched
03:26:59 the newest ones that had gone up since the last time
03:27:01 I had
03:27:03 scoped it out
03:27:05 you should watch every single one
03:27:07 I might have watched
03:27:09 all of you know what
03:27:11 I started to watch the one where he had
03:27:13 including his like talks his talks he does
03:27:15 are also like impressively good
03:27:17 I started watching the one about
03:27:19 his live shows like require so much coordination
03:27:21 and like setting things up
03:27:23 I started watching the video about
03:27:25 about the last Starfighter
03:27:27 I got bored
03:27:29 I like that one I thought that was interesting
03:27:31 I wasn't that interested in it
03:27:33 I like hearing minutia about
03:27:35 special effects so like I said that one
03:27:37 it did it for me
03:27:39 when people talk about things
03:27:41 they're really interested in
03:27:43 maybe I should give that one another try
03:27:45 I tried to watch the one
03:27:47 okay where he had
03:27:49 Beekman on it because like I remember
03:27:51 Beekman I saw Beekman's world on TV
03:27:53 as a kid and I was like oh my god it's
03:27:55 fucking Beekman but there was
03:27:57 okay I feel bad I feel bad to say
03:27:59 it about someone
03:28:01 esteemed as captain
03:28:03 D but I
03:28:05 when he was introducing Beekman
03:28:07 and they're getting really excited about
03:28:09 we should collab with each other
03:28:11 I was like it's too corny
03:28:13 it's too corny I'm cringing
03:28:15 I can't do it I had to
03:28:17 class that one
03:28:19 so I was
03:28:21 bored that one was a little like
03:28:23 I liked that he clearly had a good time
03:28:25 making it but I was like
03:28:27 he was like I can't believe
03:28:29 I've got Beekman on my show
03:28:31 and I'm like good for you
03:28:33 good for him you know I'm happy for him
03:28:35 now I fell so I was like you know
03:28:37 he clearly liked this one so
03:28:39 I used to watch Beekman
03:28:41 and it's so fucking
03:28:43 it's so weird to see Beekman but he's like 30 years
03:28:45 older now it's like oh my god
03:28:47 what the hell
03:28:49 what's happening
03:28:53 very very just
03:28:55 but that really
03:28:57 jogged a memory like oh yeah
03:28:59 Beekman's world
03:29:01 it was like Bill Nye but like Goofyere
03:29:03 yeah
03:29:05 cool cool shit
03:29:09 do people know about Beekman
03:29:11 surely some people just heard about
03:29:13 I'll be honest I'd never heard of him
03:29:15 outside of the Captain D
03:29:17 I wasn't aware to be honest
03:29:19 well okay
03:29:21 oh well
03:29:23 I remember when I was a little kid I thought he was like
03:29:25 Bill Nye but better
03:29:27 clearly people remember Captain D
03:29:29 he's gonna make sure all the new kids remember who he is
03:29:31 I thought he was funnier than Bill Nye
03:29:35 yes
03:29:37 I'm trying to think of like British equivalents
03:29:39 of like ooh science is cool
03:29:41 kids but I don't think we had
03:29:43 brainiac science abuse hosted by Richard Hammond
03:29:47 oh fuck that no
03:29:49 ham that's food
03:29:51 I remember that
03:29:53 I think we had like horrible science or horrible histories
03:29:55 but I don't think they were shows back then
03:29:57 we were just
03:29:59 Harry Potter
03:30:01 Harry Potter wasn't a scientist
03:30:03 he was the exact opposite
03:30:05 he was a sorcerer
03:30:07 from hell
03:30:09 he wasn't a sorcerer he was a philosopher
03:30:11 oh fuck
03:30:13 in America he was a sorcerer
03:30:15 and it made us really mad
03:30:19 do you know that the Harry Potter books in the UK
03:30:21 are entirely about philosophy
03:30:23 they're not anything to do with them
03:30:25 they cut out all mentions of magic
03:30:27 it's completely different like
03:30:29 setting
03:30:31 Harry Potter goes to Harvard and he thinks about things
03:30:33 I can't believe they localized
03:30:35 America they decided to turn it into magic
03:30:37 because they don't know what thinking is
03:30:39 nobody in England likes the movies because of that
03:30:41 because the English people are all wizards
03:30:43 the Nietzsche election
03:30:45 book one Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
03:30:47 book two Harry Potter debates
03:30:49 Noam Chomsky
03:30:51 and so on
03:30:53 the Chamber of Nietzsche
03:30:55 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Philosophy
03:30:57 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Philosophy
03:30:59 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Philosophy
03:31:01 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Philosophy
03:31:03 the Philosopher's Gewand
03:31:05 I want to hear what
03:31:07 Slaver shall we commission a dub of
03:31:09 oh I was going to say commission a dub of
03:31:11 Full Metal Alchemist but
03:31:13 every time they say Philosopher's Stone
03:31:15 get them to say Sorcerer's Stone instead
03:31:17 or like do a video review or it's like
03:31:19 I just don't understand what's going on in this show
03:31:21 what is a philosopher I don't get it
03:31:23 they localize it better
03:31:25 remember when Adult Swim
03:31:27 just aired Full Metal Alchemist
03:31:29 but they just dubbed a bunch of fart sounds
03:31:31 into it
03:31:33 I have always appreciated the really
03:31:35 stupid and like even unfunny
03:31:37 pranks that Adult Swim
03:31:39 has pulled just because I think it was a
03:31:41 you're never going to see another channel do anything
03:31:43 interesting I couldn't fucking believe it
03:31:45 I think it was an April Fool's joke and on April Fool's
03:31:47 they just aired the first episode
03:31:49 of Full Metal Alchemist but they just put
03:31:51 fart sounds into it
03:31:53 at like you know funny times
03:31:55 when like it was like ha ha ha
03:31:57 like during an awkward pause
03:31:59 like she farts like LeMalle
03:32:01 that was someone's job
03:32:03 at Turner Network
03:32:05 and it was great
03:32:07 I love it
03:32:09 I hope
03:32:11 I hope people
03:32:13 I hope networks do more things like that
03:32:15 what a
03:32:17 man that's like a
03:32:19 even exists anymore outside of Adult Swim
03:32:21 like a fucking network with like
03:32:23 editorial control
03:32:25 like that they can just like do stupid shit
03:32:27 and it's funny
03:32:29 that's what the internet's for now
03:32:31 that seems like such an outdated
03:32:33 thing that seems like so old school
03:32:35 like some dudes
03:32:37 running a magazine just like making a magazine
03:32:39 out of their garage or whatever
03:32:41 yeah TV doesn't exist anymore
03:32:43 I don't understand
03:32:45 do kids today watch TV
03:32:47 they watch TV in the sense they'll watch shows
03:32:49 on like a streaming service I guess
03:32:51 but I don't understand how network television
03:32:53 is still afloat
03:32:55 boomers
03:32:57 I guess all boomers are still watching TV
03:32:59 there's more boomers than there are kids
03:33:01 because as soon as you're like 19
03:33:03 you're a boomer now
03:33:05 they lowered the age of boomer first they lowered down to 30 year old boomer
03:33:07 now it's like anyone who isn't
03:33:09 you know people
03:33:11 people still listen to the radio
03:33:13 like the radio is not
03:33:15 like going away
03:33:17 radio has like a long easy reach
03:33:19 like it's really easy to broadcast
03:33:21 well it's not like super easy to broadcast things yourself
03:33:23 I mean actually it is pretty easy like I don't know if you know
03:33:25 like review bra like report of the week guy
03:33:27 he is like obsessed with like radio
03:33:29 he has like a radio show that he hosts and stuff
03:33:31 wait really no I
03:33:33 I did not know about that
03:33:35 that's very funny
03:33:37 he's an old fashioned kind of guy
03:33:39 he gave me a shout out on one of his shows once
03:33:41 really that's awesome
03:33:43 I knew I knew about his radio show but I didn't listen to it
03:33:45 yeah I only listen to it a couple times
03:33:47 but like it's just like interesting
03:33:49 like it's also weird that like a normal person
03:33:51 can have a radio show where you like play like copyrighted music
03:33:53 and stuff like I don't understand how the rules
03:33:55 about music on the radio work but there's like
03:33:57 some weird interesting shit going on over there
03:33:59 well you pay commission
03:34:01 like a little bit of money for each song you play
03:34:03 doesn't that sound like that
03:34:05 you can get like a license or something I really don't know the details
03:34:07 I don't want to speak and like say a bunch of bullshit
03:34:09 that's not true
03:34:11 like in the day they'd get like a check in the mail
03:34:13 of like here's how many times your song
03:34:15 was played on the radio in the entire world
03:34:17 this week and it's like well
03:34:19 billions and billions of dollars
03:34:21 now it's like your song was played
03:34:23 like 14 million times on Spotify
03:34:25 this week here's $20
03:34:27 yeah it's like nothing you get
03:34:29 streaming rights are like it's a whole fucked up situation
03:34:31 I'm not a musical artist so I don't even know
03:34:33 what is the pay
03:34:35 is actually pretty good
03:34:37 I think it's been getting better
03:34:39 someone posted how much money they make for each streaming service
03:34:41 and Napster was the most
03:34:43 what? how?
03:34:47 uh cause it's a paid service now
03:34:49 and some music artists
03:34:51 gets the most money from Napster than
03:34:53 any other streaming service
03:34:55 I can't remember who it was I did see that
03:34:57 yeah me neither
03:34:59 who the fuck like how is Napster still a thing
03:35:01 it was like a mainstream artist wasn't it
03:35:03 yeah
03:35:05 it wasn't like Drake or something was it
03:35:07 I guess it still exists but I can't go like
03:35:09 find a paid version of Kazaa and Limewire
03:35:11 uh
03:35:13 uh
03:35:15 they couldn't cope with the changes
03:35:19 yeah what were you gonna say about review?
03:35:21 oh I was just gonna ask like what does
03:35:23 his radio show about
03:35:25 oh he just like talks about his life
03:35:27 and stuff it's not like
03:35:29 he's not like talking about like food on it
03:35:31 or anything like he's apart from like
03:35:33 I guess that is his job
03:35:35 my question
03:35:37 is like why
03:35:39 why do it on the radio?
03:35:41 why not stream it on like
03:35:43 why not do it a podcast where it would get way more views
03:35:45 that's just cause that's just how he likes
03:35:47 he just likes the radio like the technology
03:35:49 there's like it beams all across the
03:35:51 planets like people across in other countries
03:35:53 can hear it and he's like send they send back
03:35:55 people in other countries can see it on the internet
03:35:57 I don't
03:35:59 well a lot of he's talking about like
03:36:01 countries that don't have easy access to internet stuff
03:36:03 but yeah like I do know what you mean
03:36:05 I agree with you like it's very old fashioned
03:36:07 okay I mean
03:36:09 I'm genuinely curious like
03:36:11 does broadcasting via radio
03:36:13 give you like access to some
03:36:15 audience that like you could not reach
03:36:17 via the internet
03:36:19 yeah it does
03:36:21 I thought it was the opposite
03:36:23 unless it's like a global like network
03:36:25 or whatever like series or something
03:36:27 yeah I would think that if you were doing it radio
03:36:29 you would be like you would specifically
03:36:31 reaching like a local audience like
03:36:33 they would have to be like somewhat geographically
03:36:35 near he like buys
03:36:37 time slots with some fucking
03:36:39 company or something that broadcasted around
03:36:41 the world I really don't know the details so I don't
03:36:43 want to look into it yourself
03:36:45 not just you Ben and people I'm talking to but the
03:36:47 viewer or the listener listening to this right now
03:36:49 if you don't believe me look up I'm sure
03:36:51 you could find him talking about it on the
03:36:53 radio show because he's you know that's one of the things he's
03:36:55 interested in it's just an
03:36:57 interesting thing it's just an interesting that like
03:36:59 radio still exists
03:37:01 imagine being okay it's just such a
03:37:03 weird thing because like
03:37:05 if you're
03:37:07 review brah like the one thing you
03:37:09 don't have to worry about
03:37:11 is like how am I going to reach
03:37:13 my audience right
03:37:15 exactly like that's the one thing you'd be like
03:37:17 like that's settled like like your
03:37:19 method of like
03:37:21 reaching an audience is you got it
03:37:23 that's crazy that's crazy
03:37:25 I don't know
03:37:27 who's is to broadcast a radio show to I don't know
03:37:29 some like a few thousands
03:37:31 of people like people listen to the radio you know it's not
03:37:33 like some nobody listens to it but like yes
03:37:35 he literally has like millions of subs you could easily
03:37:37 have more people and get eyeballs on it
03:37:39 if you wanted I don't know some people just like
03:37:41 certain things I don't know
03:37:43 I sort of get I like some old technology I like
03:37:45 my old CRT TV
03:37:47 I'd be curious is it just
03:37:49 about like is it just
03:37:51 about like loving the technology
03:37:53 or is it about like
03:37:55 reaching like a different community like is like
03:37:57 the community of like the radio
03:37:59 listener like
03:38:01 his parents
03:38:03 I would have seen he simply does not care
03:38:05 who's listening
03:38:07 I think it's a combination of both those things like
03:38:09 he's happy to get the people who would you know
03:38:11 only listen to radio but he just he's doing it because
03:38:13 he likes radio like I really do think that is the main thing
03:38:15 like he just wants to do it that's his hobby
03:38:17 he just enjoys it
03:38:19 he like listens to other radio shows too
03:38:21 you know what I mean and like he's like
03:38:23 I mean most
03:38:25 most boomer for people just
03:38:27 you know if you're like a right-wing pundit
03:38:29 for instance you just do a podcast
03:38:31 but you just like pretend it's a radio
03:38:33 show like you just you have
03:38:35 you have the microphone and you set it up
03:38:37 the studio so it looks like
03:38:39 a Howard Stern like like like
03:38:41 broadcasting station or whatever you just you just
03:38:43 pretend you're on the radio and other what otherwise
03:38:45 do nothing differently
03:38:47 that's the easiest way to post your microphone
03:38:49 yeah that's the easiest way to do it
03:38:51 but I guess I think some
03:38:53 boomers authentic thing
03:38:55 that sort of ties in like boomers are
03:38:57 comforted by the fact that radio has like
03:38:59 barely changed like I remember listening to the annoying
03:39:01 shitty radio DJ
03:39:03 morning hosts when I was a kid and you can turn on the radio today
03:39:05 and it's the same exact annoying shitty banter
03:39:07 you know it's like exactly the same medium as it was
03:39:09 30 years ago and like longer back
03:39:11 than that I can have I guess
03:39:13 I can appreciate
03:39:15 I guess I can appreciate that
03:39:17 I wonder if I wonder if I'll be
03:39:19 the same with like
03:39:21 God I don't know
03:39:23 I was already having my insane boomer
03:39:25 moment about forums you know what I mean earlier
03:39:27 this podcast or someone listening
03:39:29 would be like what the fuck is these guys talking about
03:39:31 with forums these fucking crazy old boomers
03:39:33 what am I gonna what am I gonna have
03:39:35 my boomer moment about is it gonna be like
03:39:37 video game analysis
03:39:39 YouTube videos is that what I'm gonna be like
03:39:41 like oh they don't make up like they used to
03:39:43 come over here to me
03:39:45 come watch toki meki memorial
03:39:47 we've grown analysts we're just not gonna do it right
03:39:51 they don't put the cartoon avatar
03:39:53 in the bottom right corner anymore
03:39:55 how my arms aren't even crossed how do you know he's mad
03:39:57 how am I
03:39:59 they do they do they do do that actually
03:40:01 it's vtubers
03:40:03 the media hasn't been the same since rich got hairplugs
03:40:05 really rude on the show
03:40:07 I was um
03:40:09 I was thinking about vtubers
03:40:11 yeah vtubers is basically like
03:40:13 yeah it's it's kind of
03:40:15 the next step it is it is the next
03:40:17 logical evolution of like the little
03:40:19 the cartoon avatar in the corner
03:40:21 um I okay
03:40:23 I hate vtubers I hate them
03:40:25 um and the reason why I hate them
03:40:27 is because all right on the endless
03:40:29 war twitter account I
03:40:31 subscribe to like two vtubers because
03:40:33 they were slime themed vtubers
03:40:35 one of them was like a marshmallow
03:40:37 slime girl and the other was like a little slime
03:40:39 ball and I was like that's funny it
03:40:41 would be funny if I followed these slime vtubers
03:40:43 on the endless war account
03:40:45 so I did and now my feed
03:40:47 is nothing but vtubers they're all getting
03:40:49 recommended to me and I
03:40:51 I hate them I hate them so much
03:40:53 they are so cloying
03:40:55 and desperate and annoying they're all
03:40:57 just like oh other vtubers
03:40:59 what are you some relatable hashtag
03:41:01 relatable vtuber problems that we vtubers
03:41:03 have to deal with I'm looking for other
03:41:05 vtubers to please follow me and play
03:41:07 games with me and that's all it is
03:41:09 that's all I fucking see I hate them
03:41:11 just just just die alone
03:41:13 stop stop posting
03:41:15 let me just reiterate for listeners
03:41:17 Ben St hates vtubers because he
03:41:19 chose of his own free will to
03:41:21 follow vtubers that he didn't even watch
03:41:23 on his twitter account and now they're putting him on
03:41:25 fucking recommendations what the fuck no it's
03:41:27 not just the two it's not just the two
03:41:29 now I see like hundreds of them my whole feed
03:41:31 is full of all these other random vtubers
03:41:33 and like I don't want to see you I just thought
03:41:35 it was funny because these two guys were slime
03:41:37 I just wanted the slime but now
03:41:39 I have all this bullshit
03:41:41 and I just I just want to be pure
03:41:43 I just want to be free get it off my fucking
03:41:45 feed how dare these
03:41:47 fucking vtubers post about
03:41:49 collabing with each other on my timeline
03:41:51 I just don't want to see it I just hate
03:41:53 them fucking I just it's
03:41:55 it's just they're just all like oh it's like
03:41:57 haha we've got to be friends
03:41:59 you should use the other vtubers
03:42:01 to respond to all these being like would you just shut the fuck
03:42:03 up already please shut up I go
03:42:05 I go into all the compasses I'm like please stop
03:42:07 posting I don't know why I'm seeing
03:42:09 your post I don't want it on my timeline
03:42:11 please stop please leave me
03:42:13 alone I mean
03:42:15 Ben you could just block them
03:42:17 no
03:42:19 that's I know he can't do that then he wouldn't
03:42:21 be able to complain about it you them you turn off
03:42:23 retweets you guys are being uncharitable
03:42:25 to me I did not follow these people
03:42:27 these people because I followed these other
03:42:29 two these just all
03:42:31 just tons of others just just keep
03:42:33 appearing I think it's maybe
03:42:35 it's because those two like follow a bunch
03:42:37 of other ones and so I get like shown
03:42:39 them because I follow
03:42:41 your tweet wait do you not set your twitter to
03:42:43 only show like recent tweets
03:42:45 you're getting random recommendations I don't get that on twitter
03:42:47 I don't know
03:42:49 I didn't really fuck with the settings
03:42:51 I don't know
03:42:53 I do everything I can to avoid getting
03:42:55 like random recommendations by the algorithm
03:42:57 I only want to see
03:42:59 tweets in chronological order yeah people I follow
03:43:01 and that's why I'm getting I'm getting recommend
03:43:03 it and it's all just like
03:43:05 and it's they all just
03:43:07 they all just want to they all just want to like
03:43:09 collab and like share one another's
03:43:11 audience there's and like play games with
03:43:13 each other and like build their they're all
03:43:15 like like a regular you super make
03:43:17 connection I know
03:43:19 they're just playing the cloud game they're playing
03:43:21 the cloud game like anyone else it's fine
03:43:23 I can't hold it against them just like
03:43:25 Lindsay Ellis I can't hold it against them
03:43:27 it's just annoying when I see it
03:43:29 Hey
03:43:31 do you ever think about how much money you could
03:43:33 make if you made like a failure vtuber and got
03:43:35 like a lady player I have
03:43:37 thought about it I don't know who I would get
03:43:39 to do it though I think I think about that
03:43:41 a lot with my characters and like fuck
03:43:43 I wish I had a girl voice
03:43:45 I do sort of just I was
03:43:47 for the record I was being uncharitable
03:43:49 on purpose to Ben and I want to say
03:43:51 I know some fair points
03:43:53 like there is some there is something very
03:43:55 like I there's already
03:43:57 a weird parasocial aspect to being a youtuber
03:43:59 okay but it feels like vtubers are like
03:44:01 aware of that and they're like leaning into it
03:44:03 on purpose yeah they feed off it
03:44:05 I don't I
03:44:07 I'm being I mean I'm being a little
03:44:09 you know like obviously I don't
03:44:11 have to read these posts but I don't know
03:44:13 so something about something about the
03:44:15 content creation plus
03:44:17 like an extra little visual thing
03:44:19 it not there are good ones
03:44:21 I've seen good ones I'm sure
03:44:23 the problem is that most of them are streamers
03:44:25 and that's just not content I'm interested in
03:44:27 yeah yeah yeah it's mostly streamers
03:44:29 and it's all
03:44:31 like it's all
03:44:33 it's all like the same like it's all the same product
03:44:35 but it's all
03:44:37 it's okay okay easier for me to
03:44:39 like see the appeal when it's like I'm only seeing
03:44:41 the highest quality vtuber moment and I'm only
03:44:43 seeing them animated by beautiful professional
03:44:45 like animation level you know what I mean like
03:44:47 like that's my only exposure to it because I'm not going out
03:44:49 there searching for
03:44:51 but I totally get we're coming there's just there's
03:44:53 just something a little a little weird to me about
03:44:55 like okay anyone who
03:44:57 can like you know it's like the barrier
03:44:59 to entry to be a vtuber is not that high
03:45:01 you can you don't
03:45:03 need like a hugely expensive
03:45:05 rig to have
03:45:07 what it takes to call yourself a vtuber and so it's just
03:45:09 it's just a little weird to see like so
03:45:11 many of them
03:45:13 all just kind of trying to do
03:45:15 I mean you know
03:45:17 there's there's there's there's not that much
03:45:19 it's weirdly corporate there's not that much
03:45:21 there's this weird thing about it it's not about being corporate
03:45:23 it's about the fact that like how like how different
03:45:25 can these be from
03:45:27 each other and yet they're all there's so many
03:45:29 of them right yeah everyone
03:45:31 just wants to be like it's not necessarily about
03:45:33 being corporate but everyone just wants to follow that model
03:45:35 and no one wants to like do really creative interesting
03:45:37 things like I mean you know I guess I can't blame
03:45:39 people for wanting to be a cute anime girl instead of like a
03:45:41 weird fucked up monster but I want to see more
03:45:43 weird vtuber there's just too many of them
03:45:45 to for me to be like okay
03:45:47 like like how many of them do they really
03:45:49 need to be how how many of them
03:45:51 do we really need you know it's I
03:45:53 yeah dude I
03:45:55 when member kizuna I she was like the only
03:45:57 one and everyone's like oh look at this new thing
03:45:59 and then you know there was like a new then there were a few
03:46:01 of them she was like the first one to mine
03:46:03 all I mean she wouldn't probably not the first ever
03:46:05 really blow up and then she just sort of fell off
03:46:07 because of some reasons I don't give a fuck
03:46:09 and then there was coronae coronae was coronae
03:46:11 the dog one and then there's like a couple others
03:46:13 that got really popular and now you're right now
03:46:15 there's a million of these fucking people and
03:46:17 like it's like impossible and like they're all there's
03:46:19 so many of them that have like a over a million subs and stuff
03:46:21 I have to say I am disappointed
03:46:23 in the NSFW like vtuber
03:46:25 scene because project melody
03:46:27 was also on there pretty early and got super
03:46:29 popular and she's got like this freedy model
03:46:31 and stuff and she does like porn streams
03:46:33 and I'm sitting here like
03:46:35 why are you not like
03:46:37 there are so many like
03:46:39 like fetish content
03:46:41 that you could be doing that because
03:46:43 you're like a cartoon character you could actually
03:46:45 do it like breast expansion
03:46:47 or whatever the fuck
03:46:49 and just no one fucking does it
03:46:51 it's like you're wasting
03:46:53 so much potential
03:46:55 like literally why bother
03:46:57 it's about the teas
03:46:59 she's got like the full
03:47:01 you have to deliver at some point
03:47:03 you have to deliver on the teas eventually
03:47:07 she's got like a full
03:47:09 body rig
03:47:11 like her rig is obviously
03:47:13 you know like not something
03:47:15 that your average schmuck
03:47:17 could afford to be doing
03:47:19 yeah it is a little
03:47:21 weird that like I don't know
03:47:23 I don't know there's something a little strange about
03:47:25 people trying to you know
03:47:27 foster this whole parasocial thing where you're like
03:47:29 but it's funny because it's like oh it's like nobody
03:47:31 thinks that they're really talking to a cute
03:47:33 anime girl like everyone's aware like everyone's
03:47:35 aware that like it's a shared
03:47:37 delusion right like
03:47:39 you know that there's a real human behind that screen
03:47:41 like that's the implicit understanding
03:47:43 because some people sort of lose track of that but like
03:47:45 that's my understanding right
03:47:47 it's like you can't like get mad at a guy
03:47:49 for simping over some vtuber
03:47:51 it's like his choice I guess I don't know
03:47:53 when you have
03:47:55 you know when the barrier to entry
03:47:57 is low to do a thing that
03:47:59 lots of people to do
03:48:01 this parasocial thing
03:48:03 and lots of people try to get in
03:48:05 on that action it's
03:48:07 it creates a
03:48:09 I don't know it just creates a vibe
03:48:11 of like
03:48:13 they're all just like
03:48:15 to the untrained eye
03:48:17 to a kind of checked out sort of
03:48:19 step back like looking at it from a distance
03:48:21 viewpoint it just looks like
03:48:23 the sea of like
03:48:25 identical creatures all just like
03:48:27 kind of like just yammering
03:48:29 yammering in the same
03:48:31 it's almost like they're inspired
03:48:33 by the anime industry
03:48:35 yeah
03:48:37 you looked at those seasonal charts
03:48:39 in the last few years
03:48:41 holy fuck
03:48:43 like when it was okay
03:48:45 on the one hand like I guess it's good
03:48:47 for things to be accessible
03:48:49 it's good for I like that the barrier
03:48:51 to entry to things is low
03:48:53 so I like that things don't have to be
03:48:55 corporate right because those ones that got popular
03:48:57 early on they were all owned by like
03:48:59 that one same corporation
03:49:01 I forget what it's called but like
03:49:03 you know hololive
03:49:05 like a bunch of those people are like
03:49:07 names and you know
03:49:09 maybe if the technology
03:49:11 is more accessible that's good
03:49:13 but I guess on the other hand
03:49:15 then it leads to this
03:49:17 this chatter this community chatter that is
03:49:19 so like so much
03:49:21 it's so much maybe we need
03:49:23 we need to keep more is what I'm saying
03:49:25 there's an underlying
03:49:27 air of like loneliness and desperation
03:49:29 of the entire vtuber fend
03:49:31 yes it's so bad
03:49:33 that's that might be what I'm picking up
03:49:35 on yeah
03:49:37 and I sort of get
03:49:39 what you're saying out with like the collaboration thing
03:49:41 like is like all these early generation
03:49:43 like corporate vtubers are popular
03:49:45 and they're all collabing with each other so it's just like
03:49:47 you know making even harder for newer people to get
03:49:49 a foothold you know they all have lore
03:49:51 and they all like exist in like a shared universe
03:49:53 and I mean yeah they have the same parent
03:49:55 company so they're all
03:49:57 you know they have these like
03:49:59 they're hooked up they're keyed in
03:50:01 it's funny they were
03:50:03 like so ready for this because it's just a new
03:50:05 version of idols you know what I mean I even have like
03:50:07 graduation ceremonies where they retire and shit
03:50:09 like it's literally just virtual idols at this point
03:50:11 like that's why they were so easily able to get
03:50:13 ready and capitalize on it Mary whether
03:50:15 he tweeted the other day that
03:50:17 like he never wants to graduate
03:50:19 and I didn't know what it meant
03:50:21 but then like in a tweet he clarified
03:50:23 it like in a reply he
03:50:25 clarified that it means
03:50:27 stop vtubing
03:50:29 and I was like oh
03:50:31 oh right right is that
03:50:33 from like an idol culture thing like when an idol
03:50:35 gets old enough they graduate because like it's
03:50:37 like you're too old now
03:50:39 it's literally just idol culture
03:50:41 I see I see you're too old now you're 20
03:50:43 you're 25 no one could ever
03:50:45 do they god 22
03:50:47 do they even make it 20%
03:50:49 because you can be an older
03:50:51 woman and be a vtuber and that's I think
03:50:53 it's a little slightly controversial for some
03:50:55 people because you know they get like docs and stuff of course
03:50:57 yeah cuz in Japan they don't want to fuck kids
03:50:59 apparently
03:51:01 I heard Corona was
03:51:03 actually like 35 or something
03:51:05 Corona based
03:51:07 yeah good for her
03:51:09 I legitimately think that's a good thing like the older
03:51:11 people can you know it's not just like
03:51:13 you know people don't graduate
03:51:15 because they're getting aged out necessarily
03:51:17 it's more just like you know you have to
03:51:19 keep your rare
03:51:21 they all just want
03:51:23 forever it would kill hype and they wouldn't
03:51:25 be able to pump the new ones as much I don't know
03:51:27 I'm not like a vtuber expert I'm really not
03:51:29 so I don't want to speak with authority like I really
03:51:31 know what's going on behind the scenes
03:51:33 that being the case I don't really understand
03:51:35 why they do graduate
03:51:37 because like what
03:51:39 if you're a popular vtuber
03:51:41 if you're a popular vtuber
03:51:43 why would you stop doing it because
03:51:45 like why what
03:51:47 the only one I heard about
03:51:49 who got fired
03:51:51 or whatever is because they said something
03:51:53 like Taiwan is real or something
03:51:55 yeah uh someone
03:51:57 some big one retired
03:51:59 recently and it was like they're not
03:52:01 they're never gonna fire you they're gonna like
03:52:03 make you go through the whole song and dance of
03:52:05 graduating you know what I mean because
03:52:07 and you have to pretend that nothing bad is happening
03:52:09 they're totally not sending
03:52:11 you to the glue factory
03:52:13 it's so yeah it's such an ominous
03:52:15 thing or it's like it feels like a euphemism
03:52:17 like we're graduating it feels like they're getting
03:52:19 taken behind the shed and kills
03:52:21 the giver like
03:52:23 like oh yeah we're graduating them
03:52:25 like yeah we're putting them out
03:52:27 into the real world
03:52:29 are we yeah
03:52:31 we're sending them to a magical place
03:52:33 uh
03:52:35 creepy
03:52:37 creepy
03:52:39 um
03:52:41 I don't
03:52:43 I don't know how we got
03:52:45 how did I get here oh no
03:52:47 the brain fog my COVID brain
03:52:49 my COVID brain fog
03:52:51 conversations went
03:52:53 it was because
03:52:55 it was because you're talking about youtube
03:52:57 the cartoon avatars
03:52:59 right oh god
03:53:01 never went ages ago
03:53:03 the most popular vtuber in the world referenced
03:53:05 the cum zone I remember
03:53:07 wait really?
03:53:09 did she do it on purpose?
03:53:11 yes I was watching
03:53:13 her minecraft lets play because I was
03:53:15 I saw a clip from it and I'm like minecraft
03:53:17 I'm interested minecraft lets plays are usually good
03:53:19 like when they're first starting out
03:53:21 and it did I think her I watched
03:53:23 like the first like four vods four or five
03:53:25 vods before I got bored
03:53:27 um and yeah like uh she's like
03:53:29 oh I'm gonna put you in my chum in my
03:53:31 chum zone like wings at the camera
03:53:33 um and I'm like ha ha ha
03:53:35 I get it chum zone because she's a shark
03:53:37 that's funny
03:53:39 it's a joke
03:53:41 give her that it's an actual joke
03:53:43 and in recent
03:53:45 stream she has like a chum jar that has
03:53:47 like a miniature version of herself
03:53:49 ha ha ha ha
03:53:51 is she the most popular?
03:53:53 pretty sure she is
03:53:55 she's one of the ones that I see the most
03:53:57 for sure she's definitely up there
03:53:59 she's one of the most
03:54:01 English ones right
03:54:03 I think she is
03:54:05 I checked the subscriber counts of a few at the time
03:54:07 like a year ago and she was like shooting up
03:54:09 like past two million subscribers really fast
03:54:11 I recognize her so she's clearly
03:54:13 has some degree of
03:54:15 she's genuinely like
03:54:17 I think she genuinely has an extremely pleasant voice
03:54:19 to listen to it's very soothing
03:54:21 and I think she definitely has voice training
03:54:23 because she has very fine control over
03:54:25 her voice when she does little
03:54:27 funny sounds that go up and down in pitch
03:54:29 it's like very well controlled
03:54:31 her and Korone and maybe
03:54:33 Amelia Watson are like the three
03:54:35 that I probably have seen the most
03:54:37 Amelia Watson is like a distant third
03:54:39 um I watched
03:54:41 I watched some Amelia stuff too
03:54:43 I know the shark and I know
03:54:45 Pikami I know those two
03:54:47 Gargura is the shark
03:54:49 I don't know
03:54:51 I know Pikami because she has the funny face
03:54:53 I refuse to learn their names I only refer to the
03:54:55 the shark and the dog
03:54:57 I know one of them is a phoenix
03:54:59 that
03:55:01 I like this one's face
03:55:03 yes I know that one because she's like the tea kettle one
03:55:05 what
03:55:07 she makes tea kettle sounds
03:55:09 oh
03:55:11 her
03:55:13 she must not be a hololive
03:55:15 because she looks completely different
03:55:17 than all those people
03:55:19 yeah there are like independent ones
03:55:21 and I think there's like some people are talking about
03:55:23 forming their own little conglomerate
03:55:25 separate from hololive and stuff
03:55:27 and then hiring management to sort it out
03:55:29 for them oh no this one's really
03:55:31 cute look at that
03:55:33 look at that that's
03:55:35 precious
03:55:37 that's Pikami
03:55:39 okay well now
03:55:41 with the words
03:55:43 with the words leading VTuber podcast now
03:55:45 amazing
03:55:47 this whole segment was like
03:55:49 fucking hate VTubers
03:55:51 I fucking hate them now
03:55:53 oh this one's alright this one's not so bad
03:55:55 oh but she's so cute though
03:55:57 you know what it's because
03:55:59 I mean when you're a successful VTuber
03:56:01 you don't have to project that
03:56:03 like kind of desperate
03:56:05 air you have a desperate cloying
03:56:07 I feel bad because
03:56:09 I know it comes from a place of like
03:56:11 if you're trying to make it as a VTuber
03:56:13 you're in a really
03:56:15 tough spot and it must be really hard
03:56:17 and probably
03:56:19 basically statistically impossible
03:56:21 for you to ever claw your way up
03:56:23 to being popular from being
03:56:25 a nobody VTuber
03:56:27 so like I get it
03:56:29 but
03:56:31 I don't like but that doesn't mean I like it
03:56:33 yeah
03:56:35 well look at her go
03:56:37 why don't they all put cat ears on
03:56:39 and ruin their aesthetic
03:56:41 all the time this one doesn't
03:56:43 some of them do
03:56:45 okay well no wait no I just found a gift
03:56:47 of her doing it with cat ears on
03:56:49 people like cat ears of course there's everyone
03:56:51 to put on the cat ears at some point
03:56:53 it really paced me off when I saw the shark one with cat ears
03:56:55 it's like she's already a shark don't make her two things
03:56:57 here's a hot take
03:56:59 there's no such thing
03:57:01 as a anime girl with cat ears
03:57:03 that is good
03:57:05 the cat ears have never done anything
03:57:07 they're not good
03:57:09 they're not a good addition to a character design
03:57:11 ever never
03:57:13 that one in um
03:57:15 I don't like uh
03:57:17 what's that one anime
03:57:19 about the kid who fucks this
03:57:21 Aurora Borealis
03:57:23 oh Aurora
03:57:25 yeah it's like a
03:57:27 yeah ororaimu I don't like ororaimu
03:57:29 but that one cat
03:57:31 that girl with the cat ears is pretty good
03:57:33 isn't her name just
03:57:35 the thing about cat ears is like
03:57:37 do they have the regular human ears
03:57:39 below that do they have like four ears
03:57:41 it's just sort of like the
03:57:43 isn't it so cute to put cat ears
03:57:45 oh no it's not it does nothing
03:57:47 it does exactly nothing
03:57:49 it's completely neutral it just feels like
03:57:51 you're a fucking furry
03:57:53 I don't know
03:57:55 why there's such an infatuation with putting
03:57:57 cat ears on a person
03:57:59 I don't get it a real cat is cute
03:58:01 I think at a certain point they were supposed
03:58:03 at a certain point they were supposed to act
03:58:05 like a cat and like nuzzle up to you
03:58:07 and purr and ask for sex
03:58:09 real cats don't do that
03:58:11 that's why real cats are better
03:58:13 I guess I don't really
03:58:15 get why it's like the thing
03:58:19 I never like thought about it it's just like so
03:58:21 ingrained
03:58:23 cat boy is a cuter
03:58:25 you should like do it for more
03:58:27 the animals than just cats
03:58:29 and sometimes dogs you just have like turtle people
03:58:31 you have a turtle a shell
03:58:33 I'm a turtle girl
03:58:35 like it's a new idea
03:58:37 our entire like anime is based around
03:58:39 girls being different sorts of animals
03:58:41 I guess Japan loves
03:58:43 horse girl shows that have been a thing recently
03:58:45 where they have like horse ears
03:58:47 and all the animals are having big
03:58:49 horse dicks and I'm like yes this is good
03:58:51 more of that please
03:58:53 in America we have bunny girls
03:58:55 like the playboy mansion
03:58:57 yeah we invented
03:58:59 we invented that
03:59:01 as always we did it just like Disney
03:59:03 and Tezuka as always America did it
03:59:05 first and better
03:59:07 we invented furries
03:59:09 it's just something about like the
03:59:11 ubiquity of the cat ears as a
03:59:13 cute icon that I've just never agreed with
03:59:15 yeah I never I don't understand
03:59:17 like where did like they had to like come from
03:59:19 somewhere like the cat ears and just
03:59:21 spontaneously like they added
03:59:23 they added an armor attachment in Halo Infinite
03:59:25 which is the cat ears that you can put on any helmet
03:59:27 and it cost like
03:59:29 $15 to get them
03:59:31 it's insane and you better believe
03:59:33 tons of people are paying for that oh no yeah
03:59:35 I play the game and I see fucking like
03:59:37 20 people out of like 30
03:59:39 that I play matches with what the fucking stupid
03:59:41 cat ears thing and it's like you morons
03:59:43 you stumbags
03:59:45 genius move on their part making it 15 bucks
03:59:47 because they knew they could just milk that one
03:59:49 it's just triangle
03:59:53 it's true
03:59:55 it literally is just triangles
03:59:57 people be really loving basic shapes
03:59:59 get some squares in there
04:00:01 they love the kiki on top of the boba
04:00:03 oh I know that
04:00:05 I know that one
04:00:07 that reference
04:00:09 I suppose that's true
04:00:11 I'm stating only the truest facts
04:00:15 I'm getting hungry
04:00:17 it's muted
04:00:19 oh that's perfect I'm gonna make you hungry
04:00:21 I suggest you some food because my final topic
04:00:23 well actually it's the only topic
04:00:25 actually meant to bring on this episode
04:00:27 is I wanted to talk about some of the recipes
04:00:29 from cluster punk kitchens
04:00:31 especially the first one because it's actually
04:00:33 fucking delicious and one of the best things ever
04:00:35 I don't think anyone actually tried it
04:00:37 after I suggested it on the PCP
04:00:39 I can't remember it so yeah
04:00:41 please
04:00:43 it will rehash it for us
04:00:45 the recipe
04:00:47 it's two ingredients
04:00:49 and
04:00:51 Doritos
04:00:53 oh
04:00:55 and what you do is you put the English muffin
04:00:57 in the toaster you butter it up
04:00:59 and then you put like five or six Doritos in there
04:01:01 and you crunch it down and you eat it
04:01:03 and it's fucking delicious
04:01:05 and everyone's like oh it seems sort of okay
04:01:07 but I have made this for like seven different friends of mine
04:01:09 and every single time I hand it to them
04:01:11 they're a little skeptical if I take a bite
04:01:13 and then their eyes just light up
04:01:15 their life is changed take a bite change your life
04:01:17 and that's where it comes from is people
04:01:19 I made this
04:01:21 I invented this in like 2011
04:01:23 because I'm such a genius of just putting random shit together
04:01:25 and it is fucking tasty
04:01:27 it looks like a
04:01:29 McDuritos
04:01:31 fucking breakfast sandwich
04:01:33 and you know what it sounds like a meme item
04:01:35 if I just heard that in voicemail
04:01:37 because Doritos and Mountain Dew they're such like meme foods
04:01:39 but hey if you say it's good
04:01:41 I'll consider trying it out
04:01:43 if I ever see English muffins
04:01:45 I'll consider it
04:01:47 I'll post your pictures
04:01:49 but you're English
04:01:51 it's an American invention
04:01:55 they don't hold English muffins
04:01:57 we do have them
04:01:59 we have them in New Zealand too though
04:02:01 basically anyway you get crumpets
04:02:03 they'd be next to crumpets
04:02:05 they're always like sold next to the crumpets
04:02:07 like the worst crumpets that don't have the holes in them
04:02:11 they're basically like
04:02:13 the muffins at McDonald's
04:02:15 that's what they are
04:02:17 they're like really doughy bread
04:02:19 like all bread is doughy bread
04:02:21 but it's like
04:02:23 it's like doughier
04:02:25 not as fluffy it's more like
04:02:27 stodgy
04:02:29 more like stodgy bread
04:02:31 English muffins are fucking delicious
04:02:33 are they sweet or savory
04:02:35 the only time I eat them is when I have McDonald's breakfast
04:02:37 they're savory
04:02:39 I finish work at 6am
04:02:41 they're really good with butter
04:02:43 and Doritos
04:02:45 and you put them together and take a bite
04:02:47 change your life it's good
04:02:49 it's fucking delicious
04:02:51 everyone watching this try it at least once
04:02:53 you won't regret it
04:02:55 I promise
04:02:57 you're not allowed to hate it until you've tried it
04:02:59 I disagree I will hate it immediately
04:03:01 and forever
04:03:03 no
04:03:05 you gotta change my life
04:03:07 I've just been eating mozzarella cheese toasties recently
04:03:09 pancakes and I'm shit at that
04:03:11 that's another thing I failed at in my life
04:03:13 I don't
04:03:15 I can't cook
04:03:17 I can't do it
04:03:19 I get a canny soup
04:03:21 the thing about clusterpot kitchen recipes
04:03:23 takes zero skill
04:03:25 zero skill whatsoever
04:03:27 I think everyone was
04:03:29 macaroni and cheese with
04:03:31 honey barbecue fritos which I don't know if you can get them outside of America
04:03:33 but I just mixed the chips
04:03:35 into the mac and cheese and it was
04:03:37 pretty good it's not when you're as good as the Doritos
04:03:39 there are any recipes that aren't just like
04:03:41 make something and then put chips in it
04:03:43 um
04:03:45 I guess it depends on whether you like the chips
04:03:47 the third recipe was make spaghetti sauce
04:03:51 the third recipe was make spaghetti sauce
04:03:53 you know with like ground beef and stuff
04:03:55 but put saltine crackers in it
04:03:57 and use the sauce as a dip
04:03:59 so no every recipe is
04:04:01 just put chips in a thing
04:04:03 which is also pretty good
04:04:05 but the first Doritos was on the top of like
04:04:07 a chili con carne
04:04:09 which is good
04:04:11 what are we looking at here
04:04:13 we're talking about clusterpot kitchen
04:04:15 Ben
04:04:17 I said I was hungry and now Oblivion Fool
04:04:19 was torturing me
04:04:21 Ben you have to put Doritos in an English muffin
04:04:23 with butter it's so fucking good you have no idea
04:04:25 like
04:04:27 crumbled up or just
04:04:29 no just like 5 or
04:04:31 just like between 4 or 5
04:04:33 Doritos put them like in an English muffin
04:04:35 you can like crunch it down
04:04:37 I don't see why is that better
04:04:39 why is that better than just eating Doritos
04:04:43 it's a meal
04:04:45 it just tastes really fucking good
04:04:47 it's a feast
04:04:49 it's a meal
04:04:51 everyone I save is to Ben doesn't believe me
04:04:53 and then I make it for them I give it to him
04:04:55 they take a bite, their eyes light up, their life is changed
04:04:57 take a bite, change your life, it's real
04:04:59 so you butter the English muffin
04:05:01 what flavor Dorino
04:05:03 can you do any flavor
04:05:05 the nacho cheese works best
04:05:07 I've tried a few different flavors but the nacho cheese works best
04:05:09 or cheese supreme
04:05:11 I know what all those ingredients taste like
04:05:13 I'm imagining them together
04:05:15 and I don't know if they
04:05:17 do they really enhance each other that much
04:05:19 I don't know
04:05:21 they really do
04:05:23 I mean maybe you'll hate it
04:05:25 but I've given it to like 7 people
04:05:27 I'm sure I wouldn't hate it
04:05:29 okay I mean if you say so
04:05:31 hmm
04:05:33 well now I'm worried I'm hyping it up
04:05:35 I just really like it
04:05:37 it's like the best thing to have
04:05:39 it's the best way to eat both of those things
04:05:41 if I had all
04:05:43 if I had any, well I have butter
04:05:45 but if I had those three things
04:05:47 I would try it
04:05:49 but I don't
04:05:51 have you ever been at a low enough point in your life
04:05:53 that you've had paster and beans
04:05:55 that sounds like an English thing
04:05:57 paster and beans
04:05:59 paster and baked beans
04:06:01 all you got left
04:06:03 that's what you got to eat
04:06:05 I mean sometimes I just have
04:06:07 rice and beans
04:06:09 rice and beans is
04:06:11 filling and it's very easy
04:06:13 and I don't think that's too bad
04:06:15 rice doesn't fill me up
04:06:17 whenever I have rice I get hungry again
04:06:19 oh you're eating shit rice
04:06:21 you need to get that good rice
04:06:23 I don't know what it is
04:06:25 well rice
04:06:27 rice has the problem that most
04:06:29 carbohydrates have for me
04:06:31 which is that I can feel like I can just
04:06:33 eat an infinite amount of it and never
04:06:35 stop being hungry
04:06:37 so yeah I'm with you on that
04:06:39 um
04:06:41 paster and beans
04:06:43 like what kind of beans
04:06:45 baked beans like in tomato sauce
04:06:47 oh right
04:06:49 the English
04:06:51 tomatoes
04:06:53 because okay
04:06:55 if the beans are in tomato sauce
04:06:57 that sort of makes a little more sense
04:06:59 then like it's not like beans and molasses
04:07:01 like we would have here
04:07:03 that would be disgusting
04:07:05 yeah
04:07:07 more like that sounds gross
04:07:09 I don't think I've ever eaten molasses I don't even know what it is really
04:07:11 it's sugary stuff
04:07:13 I know it goes slow sometimes or something
04:07:15 isn't it sugary syrupy like super sticky
04:07:17 something or other
04:07:19 yeah the beans baked beans
04:07:21 but here they'd be in a can that have
04:07:23 it's sort of like a molassesy
04:07:25 sort of maybe caramel
04:07:27 not really caramel I don't know
04:07:29 it's like brown sugar it's like a thick
04:07:31 sort of brown sugary kind of
04:07:33 syrup
04:07:35 doesn't it go slow on a sundae or something
04:07:37 yeah it's very I mean pure molasses
04:07:39 is very thick
04:07:41 like it's like
04:07:43 it's thicker than
04:07:45 it's thicker than like peanut butter
04:07:47 basically it's like you can't even pour it
04:07:49 it's actually
04:07:51 I've tried I think
04:07:53 I tried like pure molasses
04:07:55 actually like gross
04:07:57 there's um
04:07:59 there's a scene in over the garden
04:08:01 is it over the garden wall
04:08:03 where they put molasses
04:08:05 they put molasses in their potatoes
04:08:07 and
04:08:09 and I'm convinced that that would be like vile
04:08:13 because like pure molasses is
04:08:15 like it is sweet but it's like
04:08:17 sickening like
04:08:19 sort of like powerful flavor
04:08:21 like you
04:08:23 you mix that shit
04:08:25 you don't just put a big dollop of it
04:08:27 on whatever you're eating
04:08:29 okay
04:08:31 yeah that's my molasses
04:08:33 rant
04:08:35 thanks for coming to
04:08:37 what's that about molasses
04:08:39 you would use it as like a baking ingredient
04:08:41 you could like bake it into like a bread
04:08:43 it's just sort of like a brown sugary
04:08:45 like dark
04:08:47 sweeteners
04:08:49 effects
04:08:51 anyway
04:08:53 the point is it would be terrible on pasta
04:08:55 just disgusting
04:08:59 okay I won't do that in the future
04:09:01 if I ever get a hold of it
04:09:03 instead of take a bite change your life
04:09:05 it should be
04:09:07 take a life
04:09:09 go to jail
04:09:11 that's it okay yeah
04:09:13 take a life get out of here
04:09:15 take a life
04:09:17 kill
04:09:19 a wife
04:09:21 kill people for no reason
04:09:23 take my wife please
04:09:25 take a life take my wife take it all
04:09:29 you take the good you take the bad
04:09:31 you take the rest and there you have
04:09:33 the facts of life
04:09:35 speaking of good and bad
04:09:37 should we move on to voicemails
04:09:39 we've been going for 4 hours and 10 minutes
04:09:41 oh my god
04:09:43 Ellie is our I'm so salty
04:09:45 maybe it's about time
04:09:47 we've gotten oh we've got
04:09:49 we've gotten two more voicemails
04:09:51 in the time
04:09:53 that we've been going so we should stop
04:09:55 because we don't we god we don't want any more voicemails
04:09:57 ugh I want to die
04:09:59 yeah
04:10:01 well you
04:10:03 well you've probably got covid so
04:10:05 maybe maybe you will so
04:10:07 don't worry about it
04:10:09 now
04:10:11 what a happy thought
04:10:13 you're welcome
04:10:15 okay
04:10:17 let me just scroll down here I will put
04:10:19 the voicemails in
04:10:21 the chat
04:10:23 first one is
04:10:25 okay the first one is like
04:10:27 it's an emo it's like an emoji
04:10:29 but like it's not displaying so I don't know
04:10:31 what it's called whatever
04:10:33 here's the voicemail
04:10:35 three two one go
04:10:37 what if your life is a computer
04:10:39 simulation and you are the only one
04:10:41 in it so everyone you know
04:10:43 is an NPC do you think
04:10:45 this is a real possibility
04:10:47 it's sort of like 12 year old question
04:10:49 is this
04:10:51 yes and no
04:10:53 wait wait wait
04:10:55 xkcd train car
04:10:59 that's so basic that's so basic
04:11:01 actually made me upset
04:11:03 I don't think it's a real possibility
04:11:05 it's a funny philosophical experiment
04:11:07 I just want to know
04:11:09 who is running this fucking private server
04:11:11 with one player on it when they're hosting an MMO
04:11:13 it doesn't make any fucking sense
04:11:17 this is a classic xkcd
04:11:19 oh yeah
04:11:21 this exact topic
04:11:23 what if you're the only real one
04:11:25 you are
04:11:27 we're just ghosts
04:11:29 okay go ahead
04:11:31 here's my answer even if you're the only real person
04:11:33 you should still be nice to the NPCs
04:11:35 because you know
04:11:37 just don't be a piece of shit
04:11:39 come on
04:11:41 being a solopsist
04:11:43 and having no friends
04:11:45 you really are the only one in the universe then
04:11:47 if I was in a simulation on my own
04:11:49 I would say like why would they put me in such
04:11:51 a boring scenario
04:11:53 whoever's overseeing this
04:11:55 sim
04:11:57 dungeon master sucks
04:11:59 I'm obsessed about these hypotheticals
04:12:01 they're like what if this thing
04:12:03 that even if it was true wouldn't really have any bearing
04:12:05 on your life
04:12:07 like who gives a fuck
04:12:09 unless I can break the simulation
04:12:11 what am I supposed to do about it
04:12:13 that's true
04:12:15 next
04:12:17 okay
04:12:19 here we go
04:12:21 next one is called
04:12:25 it's called over cooked vocalist
04:12:27 over cooked vocalist
04:12:29 three two one
04:12:31 go
04:12:33 I
04:12:35 don't get fired
04:12:37 I
04:12:39 I
04:12:41 resigned
04:12:43 boo
04:12:45 no
04:12:47 no no no
04:12:49 that's enough
04:12:51 thank you for the voicemail
04:12:53 I like that one
04:12:55 fuck you for the voicemail
04:12:57 okay next
04:12:59 it's more intellectually stimulating
04:13:01 for sure
04:13:03 that was nothing
04:13:05 you people are insane
04:13:07 this is really what happens when I quit voicemails
04:13:09 yes this is what I said
04:13:11 no more good voicemail
04:13:13 quality of voicemail
04:13:15 it's cratered
04:13:17 you were keeping the whole
04:13:19 market afloat
04:13:21 the capital that they pumped into the stock
04:13:23 to keep it afloat
04:13:25 and now we've lost it
04:13:27 covid is running ramp at the omega variant
04:13:29 I meant to say omicron
04:13:31 but sure yeah let's go with omega
04:13:33 it's fucked
04:13:35 this is what we gotta work with
04:13:37 next one is an image
04:13:39 next voicemail is a picture
04:13:41 okay
04:13:43 I was approached by an odd looking 30 something guy
04:13:45 that said fuck dude
04:13:47 how tall are you you're huge
04:13:49 I said five foot one with my boots on
04:13:51 he said want to join our yig movement
04:13:53 to stir up more shit
04:13:55 I took off my sunglasses
04:13:57 and glazed hard at him
04:13:59 and showed him my belt buckle
04:14:01 he screamed like a little girl
04:14:03 and ran off he knew an ass kicking beat down
04:14:05 was next for him
04:14:07 laughing crying emojis
04:14:09 where do you get one of those belt buckles
04:14:11 uh why is it blue
04:14:13 looks great though
04:14:15 I should make those
04:14:17 don't tread on me though
04:14:19 I'd buy one
04:14:21 this is the gadson flag
04:14:23 don't bend saint oh no
04:14:25 angels don't step on saint
04:14:27 angels sing
04:14:29 my coming
04:14:31 okay oh speaking of
04:14:33 the next one is called cummy ben
04:14:35 uh
04:14:37 here we go
04:14:39 there it is three two one go
04:14:43 please bring back gummy ben
04:14:45 keto gummies are the
04:14:47 best content you guys ever made
04:14:49 please ben I beg of you
04:14:51 I am sorry
04:14:53 but I can't
04:14:55 get the isomaltoligosaccharides
04:14:57 anymore
04:14:59 and it's the only thing that's good
04:15:01 I've tried other things that
04:15:03 everything else it's just not profitable at this point
04:15:05 to make them I mean
04:15:07 no I mean it was never not profitable
04:15:09 but you know it was never profitable it may saved money
04:15:11 for you in the sense that
04:15:13 it was a fit well I thought the whole point of making
04:15:15 gummies was you're like I don't want to pay these gummy
04:15:17 to sell me gummies I could make myself
04:15:19 it sort of was about that but then it became
04:15:21 more about the fact that they were just
04:15:23 good and I was just like I liked
04:15:25 that I could make them taste different ways
04:15:27 than I would normally be able to
04:15:29 get he was he was pulling a review
04:15:31 bra and just doing something for himself yeah
04:15:33 just like to gummies and
04:15:35 he fell in love with it because he couldn't get
04:15:37 his Chinese chemicals it's not that
04:15:39 it became too expensive that I
04:15:41 couldn't buy it it's that like just
04:15:43 like I can't
04:15:45 I think I've said this before but like I
04:15:47 can't find anyone who will sell it to me
04:15:49 in like a reasonable quantity
04:15:51 like I can only find people
04:15:53 that will sell me like a metric ton of it
04:15:55 then do it make a metric just buy
04:15:57 a metric ton of it it's like
04:15:59 I don't want to spend thousands of fucking dollars
04:16:01 it'll be like that episode
04:16:03 of the Simpsons where Homer has the pile of sugar
04:16:05 in his backyard
04:16:07 but it's isomaltic
04:16:09 saccharides for gummies but think about how much money
04:16:11 you'll save on gummies over the course of the next
04:16:13 20 years no it'll just get rained on
04:16:15 the rain will just wash it all away
04:16:17 just kill him
04:16:19 it kills for your precious
04:16:21 acids I'm sad
04:16:23 I'm sad that I can't just buy
04:16:25 like a normal amount of it anymore
04:16:27 but I have not been able to
04:16:29 find a new supplier and other
04:16:31 like substitutes that I've tried
04:16:33 allulose tastes like shit cornfiber
04:16:35 tastes like shit it all sucks
04:16:37 it's all bad IMO is the only
04:16:39 stuff that made any kind of decent
04:16:41 final product and
04:16:43 it's straight up
04:16:45 my source is gone a metric ton of
04:16:47 Igaluga mogulagasecharides would be a
04:16:49 good stretch goal for
04:16:51 a new Kickstarter if you ever did another
04:16:53 metric ton
04:16:57 yeah well
04:16:59 no I love the future
04:17:01 where Ben is just throwing in gummies with
04:17:03 every package it's the new stupid thing
04:17:05 that Ben needs but can't get it
04:17:07 honestly I would love
04:17:09 to make gummies
04:17:11 and give
04:17:13 those as backer rewards
04:17:15 or sell them to people or something
04:17:17 I would think that was really fun
04:17:19 dude you could
04:17:21 get a reputation as an art
04:17:23 comic convention type situation
04:17:25 you could be the gummy worm guy just hand out
04:17:27 gummy worms people would love you with a fire thing
04:17:29 everyone would be like oh check out the gummy guys stand
04:17:31 he makes a shitty slime comic but he gives out free gummies
04:17:33 yeah that's what I want everyone
04:17:35 to say about me
04:17:37 I wanted to get
04:17:39 a 3D mold I think
04:17:41 I talked to Smirig about this one time
04:17:43 and we never really went through with it
04:17:45 because I was still ironing out
04:17:47 the formula
04:17:49 but the idea at one point
04:17:51 was that I could maybe make
04:17:53 3D
04:17:55 printed gummy molds
04:17:57 of the various
04:17:59 fruits and vegetables that grow in
04:18:01 New Los Angeles city like dire apples
04:18:03 and
04:18:05 and phosphor poppies and stuff
04:18:07 custom gummies that's basic
04:18:09 custom New Los Angeles city gummies
04:18:11 that are like I could concoct
04:18:13 flavors for what each thing would taste
04:18:15 like and stuff
04:18:17 honestly I would
04:18:19 still do something like that I just
04:18:21 would need to get my fucking hands on
04:18:23 the other thing aside from not being able to get IMO
04:18:25 is that my kitchen now
04:18:27 is like shit
04:18:29 I used to have a slightly better kitchen
04:18:31 you know what that's not even that big
04:18:33 I could still do it I could just get
04:18:35 some new pots and pans and shit
04:18:37 and I could make it work if I wanted to
04:18:39 that's not really that big of a hurdle
04:18:41 stop getting this voicemailer's hope up if you're not going to return to the gummy arc
04:18:43 I'm saying
04:18:45 I wish I could return
04:18:47 I wish I could return to the gummy arc
04:18:49 honestly I kind of miss it
04:18:51 he likes gummies he just likes gummies
04:18:53 it's true
04:18:55 there's literally some PCP fan out there
04:18:57 who's just like god
04:18:59 Ben would make gummies again and talk about them
04:19:01 I would like nothing more
04:19:03 I would like nothing more
04:19:05 Ben talk about making roses and animal crossing again
04:19:07 that was
04:19:09 that was a mistake
04:19:11 that I should never
04:19:13 I should have never done that
04:19:15 at the end of the day there's just not that much
04:19:17 to say about it
04:19:19 listen it was like
04:19:21 it was like April of 2020
04:19:23 right we were all little
04:19:25 we were all a little weird
04:19:27 I
04:19:29 maybe it was
04:19:31 later than that but
04:19:33 no it was a time
04:19:35 some people transitioned
04:19:37 other people's made loads of roses and animal crossing
04:19:39 we
04:19:41 we all had to cope
04:19:43 some of us transitioned some of us made gummy worms
04:19:45 some of us made animal crossing roses
04:19:47 we all had our thing that got us through
04:19:49 it's true
04:19:51 next one

04:20:53 it's what he gives every game

04:21:07 and I upload sleep on angry joe more
04:21:09 yeah okay I'm coming
04:21:11 around
04:21:13 uh
04:21:15 I watched that jar media
04:21:17 uh wait no did they
04:21:19 you angry joe on the jar
04:21:21 they have a series called
04:21:23 is this as good
04:21:25 as they say or as bad as they say
04:21:27 and they didn't have to know where they talk about
04:21:29 all of his content
04:21:31 I hate it
04:21:33 I hate everything
04:21:35 that's the one
04:21:37 I know whatever I don't care
04:21:39 I didn't even know he was in it
04:21:41 and I hate everything thing
04:21:43 until I had seen a few episodes
04:21:45 I hate everything is good actually
04:21:47 I don't I genuinely don't know
04:21:49 I don't watch it
04:21:51 I come on jar media I have not watched one of his main channel videos
04:21:53 in years
04:21:55 I only know him from being on a podcast with
04:21:57 YMS
04:21:59 that sucks
04:22:01 I haven't listened to it
04:22:03 I used to hate him because I hated his
04:22:05 weird angry cartoon avatar
04:22:07 but then I realized like it's easy
04:22:09 it has good branding
04:22:11 it's really ugly so it like you sticks out in
04:22:13 your memory like and I'm always saying
04:22:15 shit like why does everyone have to use a cute
04:22:17 cartoon avatar why can't everyone have weird ugly
04:22:19 looking avatars and there's one guy had that
04:22:21 and I'm like I fucking hate it it's ugly
04:22:23 yeah I saw the jar media
04:22:25 I think I probably started with the one about
04:22:27 the wall
04:22:29 and then I maybe saw one of their other ones about Doug
04:22:31 I watched their other one about Doug Walker
04:22:33 and then I think I was looking at their other ones
04:22:35 and I watched the one about angry Joe and I think that's the
04:22:37 video that's how I know most of what I know
04:22:39 about angry Joe I know from that
04:22:41 jar media video
04:22:43 which
04:22:45 those are good videos
04:22:47 those were pretty good videos
04:22:49 I like those boys
04:22:51 next
04:22:53 okay next one is called
04:22:55 the tale of the golden witch
04:22:57 and it's a vokeru
04:22:59 oh yeah I was going to ask
04:23:01 how it's longer than 130
04:23:03 yeah it's a vokeru

04:26:34 do we have any idea who that was by
04:26:36 well it's by the same guy
04:26:38 who is sending voicemails
04:26:40 under the name drydumpdecember
04:26:42 at dustydumps.com
04:26:44 he's been sending
04:26:46 that's all I know
04:26:48 just full credit to that person
04:26:50 cause that was incredible
04:26:52 I think maybe
04:26:54 Dusty Dumps is going in the voice
04:26:56 grail for that one
04:26:58 are we feeling it?

04:27:38 Kringus Bingus in the voice
04:27:40 grail we did
04:27:42 now that sounded great to me
04:27:44 but I checked the google documents
04:27:46 and not a single trace
04:27:48 of Kringus Bingus' name
04:27:50 is on that thing
04:27:52 so this
04:27:54 makes me think

04:30:12 yeah
04:30:14 I promised I would mention this the last two times
04:30:16 I was on the PCP
04:30:18 I met spork IRL
04:30:20 they drove up to my place
04:30:22 I
04:30:24 wouldn't have a plan on what we were going to do
04:30:26 or hang out
04:30:28 they just kidnapped me they threw me in their car
04:30:30 and drove around the block once asked me where to pee
04:30:32 and I pointed them at a big lots
04:30:34 and then they dropped me off back at home
04:30:36 when I showed them road to rad con
04:30:38 and then they left
04:30:40 cool story

04:30:56 we met
04:30:58 I spoke to her very briefly
04:31:00 we were like in the same area for like 20 minutes
04:31:02 and then she fucked off
04:31:04 she was just stopping by
04:31:06 as a pit stop on the way to somewhere else
04:31:08 hmmm
04:31:10 fascinating
04:31:12 neat
04:31:14 well I don't know
04:31:16 the only time I
04:31:18 come without ejaculating
04:31:20 is if I've jerked off so many times
04:31:22 that like I just can't come anymore
04:31:24 but I just keep going
04:31:26 so
04:31:28 but I don't think that kind of feels like
04:31:30 what it
04:31:32 we're ejaculating about coming
04:31:34 because that's happened to me
04:31:36 I don't get it
04:31:38 isn't that called pissing?
04:31:40 yes
04:31:42 yeah it felt like pissing
04:31:44 you know pissing is a very important topic today
04:31:46 I feel
04:31:48 in our modern era
04:31:50 oh okay
04:31:52 shall we go to
04:31:54 the next one which is called

04:32:18 okay I'm glad to know
04:32:20 I'm glad to know yeah it's good
04:32:22 it's comforting
04:32:24 wouldn't want anything
04:32:26 to fuck it up
04:32:28 for him
04:32:30 okay next one is another
04:32:32 image
04:32:34 okay
04:32:36 here we go
04:32:38 I feel like this is an old meme
04:32:40 there's definitely been versions of this
04:32:42 okay the soy bensaint
04:32:44 has a year long beef with washed up youtubers
04:32:46 works on game that few will play
04:32:48 buy my comics please
04:32:50 spends his A.R.'s ring of people on twitter
04:32:52 covid makes his brain shrink
04:32:54 those boobs are too big
04:32:56 that's not true
04:32:58 that's the opposite of what I said
04:33:00 I'm saying that
04:33:02 big boobs need
04:33:04 more representation
04:33:06 the ones I'm seeing are not doing it
04:33:08 this guy fundamentally
04:33:10 misunderstands the character of bensaint
04:33:12 what about the last one
04:33:14 on your side though
04:33:16 that was it
04:33:18 spends his days arguing with people on twitter
04:33:20 do you want to read that one
04:33:22 okay I tried
04:33:24 I said that
04:33:26 yeah whatever
04:33:28 these are all true
04:33:30 yeah my brain did shrink due to covid
04:33:32 but it's just more efficient now
04:33:34 the chad nate bestman
04:33:36 makes you fail no nate november
04:33:38 with chad content
04:33:40 abandons his friends that don't generate him enough profit
04:33:42 only networks with people
04:33:44 larger than him
04:33:46 weird utilitarianism pilled
04:33:48 visits family even with covid
04:33:50 lives down on people less
04:33:52 successful than him
04:33:54 I think this person just hates both of us
04:33:56 yeah
04:33:58 I get to look down on nate
04:34:00 subscriber number
04:34:02 sub count
04:34:04 yeah
04:34:06 true
04:34:08 kill him
04:34:16 I can't believe someone with more subscribers
04:34:18 than nate bestman is on the procrastinators podcast
04:34:20 that's unthinkable to me
04:34:22 oh my god I kind of forgot
04:34:24 cyber shell is just
04:34:26 just one of the bullets
04:34:28 but you only have
04:34:30 guests more popular than you
04:34:32 you fucking scumbag
04:34:36 you
04:34:38 yeah but not on youtube
04:34:40 cyber shell is like two nates in a trench coat
04:34:42 with his subscriber count
04:34:44 that's true
04:34:46 but you know
04:34:48 my subscribers are sonic fans
04:34:50 so do they really count as like a mole
04:34:52 true
04:34:54 according to god
04:34:56 a sonic fan is only half a human being
04:34:58 if that
04:35:00 I was hoping we could get to three quarters
04:35:02 but I guess
04:35:04 three fifths
04:35:06 three fifths
04:35:08 compromise
04:35:10 that was the real agreement
04:35:12 they agreed
04:35:14 when noah's arc in the rainbow
04:35:16 fans will be three fifths
04:35:18 and that's just been the law
04:35:20 ever since
04:35:22 of course
04:35:24 next voicemail is called
04:35:26 where is it here we go
04:35:28 more ways to humiliate tricksy

04:35:36 okay three two one go
04:35:38 kill her
04:35:42 that would be hilarious
04:35:44 that would be a humiliation
04:35:46 that would just be like
04:35:48 ultimate break
04:35:50 ultimate break
04:35:54 that's like the business simpsons were homeless
04:35:56 thinking of revenge for net flanders
04:35:58 and it's like the leftorium closes
04:36:00 then it goes further and flanders is dead
04:36:02 and he's like no too far
04:36:04 yeah too far
04:36:06 it wouldn't be funny then
04:36:08 yeah yeah yeah

04:36:14 it might be a little funny

04:36:56 my huge forehead
04:36:58 I appreciate it
04:37:00 I appreciate that you made me a girl
04:37:02 but you didn't just like take the easy way out
04:37:04 and give me like a cute
04:37:06 a cute girl hair
04:37:08 I'm a freak

04:37:12 as a girl same as
04:37:14 same as it ever was
04:37:16 also I spy
04:37:18 I spy that soft tum
04:37:20 good detail
04:37:22 I see it
04:37:24 I don't like it it's making me
04:37:26 it's making me self-conscious I gotta get back on my diet
04:37:28 I gotta get back
04:37:30 when you have big boobs
04:37:32 you need a soft tummy to like
04:37:34 for them to rest on
04:37:36 I haven't been able to lift
04:37:38 in like two weeks because of COVID
04:37:40 because your boobs are in the way
04:37:42 my huge
04:37:44 image is too accurate to reality
04:37:46 more than you realize audience
04:37:48 it's upsetting
04:37:50 sad but true
04:37:54 next one
04:37:56 is that blue pills
04:37:58 oh
04:38:00 you weren't on
04:38:02 you weren't on
04:38:04 this episode we talked about
04:38:06 eating blue pills
04:38:08 and having huge tits
04:38:10 I thought this was about
04:38:12 when like
04:38:14 we were talking about
04:38:16 what's their face from that video game
04:38:18 we talked about the cover art
04:38:20 and booby representation
04:38:24 that was like the one before
04:38:26 it is a
04:38:28 continuation of that
04:38:30 the blue pills are
04:38:32 uh
04:38:34 related I don't know
04:38:36 I require people to draw
04:38:38 me with huge tits as well
04:38:40 just saying that
04:38:42 I'm just demanding that
04:38:44 yes whoever drew this draw a gib next please
04:38:48 next voicemail
04:38:50 Trixie will never recover
04:38:52 next voicemail
04:38:54 is not an RPG maker
04:38:56 expert
04:38:58 there it is
04:39:00 okay
04:39:02 3, 2, 1, go
04:39:04 hey
04:39:06 so I heard you guys talking about that RPG maker
04:39:08 I haven't really dabbled in it
04:39:10 much myself but from my understanding
04:39:12 if you want something done in RPG maker
04:39:14 then chances are someone has already made a plugin
04:39:16 for it like for example
04:39:18 simply having 8-way run is still
04:39:20 somehow not a standard feature
04:39:22 and it's absolutely the first thing you're
04:39:24 going to want to look for to implement
04:39:26 your game so many people
04:39:28 have managed to reverse engineer plugins
04:39:30 that work for RPG maker and a quick search
04:39:32 to hopefully find you one that works
04:39:34 and then of course it's just a matter
04:39:36 of debugging and testing to make sure
04:39:38 that you know it works
04:39:40 just for reference's sake
04:39:42 Life 2D has been a real game
04:39:44 changer for the hentai game scene
04:39:46 that should even work for the old
04:39:48 RPG maker not even VXA's
04:39:50 which is the new one just look up
04:39:52 any games made by Happy Pink I swear
04:39:54 they operate on black magic or something
04:39:56 as an alternative
04:39:58 you can try Wolf RPG editor
04:40:00 it's basically the same thing from my understanding
04:40:02 you know look up a bunch of plugins
04:40:04 they're probably already made
04:40:06 there's a Toho fan game called Genius of Sapphire
04:40:08 which is made with a heavily
04:40:10 edited wolf editor I think
04:40:12 it's probably one of my favorite RPGs
04:40:14 in general very heavily
04:40:16 inspired by the saga series
04:40:18 so yeah
04:40:20 indie RPGs have been
04:40:22 easier to make than ever before
04:40:24 crap out there but at the same time
04:40:26 there's some releases that put swear to shame
04:40:28 so yeah that's great
04:40:30 and all I'm not
04:40:32 interested in plugins
04:40:34 and shit
04:40:36 that's not real
04:40:38 I might be
04:40:40 maybe okay
04:40:42 could be some very good useful information
04:40:44 for someone watching
04:40:46 I learned a lot this past year
04:40:48 working on Phantom's Revenge
04:40:50 because I actually had to
04:40:52 code it with GML
04:40:54 I think if I
04:40:56 I don't know I can't even imagine
04:40:58 like a universe where
04:41:00 instead of that I like
04:41:02 found plugins and like
04:41:04 drop them into my game and like
04:41:06 modify it and like it's like oh does this plugin
04:41:08 work does this plugin
04:41:10 conflict with a lot of plugins
04:41:12 this sounds so stupid
04:41:14 I don't know
04:41:18 dumb
04:41:20 oh my god but I just reversed
04:41:22 image searched that
04:41:24 big booby ban image
04:41:26 see if maybe it's been posted
04:41:28 so I could find the artist
04:41:30 and all it says is did you mean objectification
04:41:32 yes
04:41:34 sorry related content
04:41:36 I did
04:41:38 just
04:41:40 okay
04:41:42 just don't be an idiot
04:41:44 just fuck around
04:41:46 with your coding language of choice
04:41:48 and just figure out how to do 8
04:41:50 just figure out how to do 8 way run yourself
04:41:52 just like don't be stupid
04:41:54 just fucking be like how do I do it
04:41:56 and think about it for a second
04:41:58 and then do it
04:42:00 duh
04:42:02 I don't think there's anything inherently wrong
04:42:04 if you just don't care about that shit
04:42:06 and you just want to like make a game
04:42:08 especially if it's just a fucking hentai game
04:42:10 then go ahead and use rpg maker plugins
04:42:12 but I agree with you in theory it's better
04:42:14 especially if you really want to make a game
04:42:16 just to know
04:42:18 actually make it yourself
04:42:20 if something goes wrong and you don't know
04:42:22 how it works you can't fix it
04:42:24 right
04:42:26 you don't want to be relying on plugins
04:42:28 you have no idea how they work
04:42:30 a hentai game
04:42:32 is a hentai game even a game
04:42:34 like if there's a loose state
04:42:36 I don't want to have is this a game
04:42:38 discourse on this fucking podcast
04:42:40 but like you're talking about like a visual novel
04:42:42 right
04:42:44 there's no if you have choices
04:42:46 it's a game
04:42:48 okay that's not what I mean but like
04:42:50 there's no
04:42:52 there's no like coding right there's no like
04:42:54 game design
04:42:56 involve
04:42:58 there's a lot of if this then that
04:43:00 so it's a fucking game
04:43:02 and it's easy to do
04:43:04 you fucking idiots I'm not
04:43:06 damn it I'm not trying to do a semantic like
04:43:08 that's not a real game yes I get it is technically
04:43:10 a game but like whatever
04:43:12 that's not like a game design
04:43:14 thing that's not something you have to
04:43:16 sit down and be like how am I gonna
04:43:18 how am I gonna achieve this like no
04:43:20 it's just like yeah obviously you can use plugins
04:43:22 absolutely can be
04:43:24 obviously you can use plugins for that because like
04:43:26 you don't need it to do anything
04:43:28 right
04:43:30 I don't agree
04:43:32 like I've
04:43:34 spoken to for eyes a lot about
04:43:36 like potential like hentai game
04:43:38 ideas and a lot of them like would involve
04:43:40 like actual game mechanics that revolve
04:43:42 around sex in interesting
04:43:44 ways
04:43:46 better not it's not just oh there's a
04:43:48 you lose and then you get fucked and it's just imagining
04:43:50 the most basic visual
04:43:52 awful possible and yeah to do that kind of shit
04:43:54 yeah you don't need plugins or anything but like
04:43:56 making basic visual novels yeah obviously
04:43:58 but like you can like make RPGs
04:44:00 and or things we have like sex
04:44:02 stats and I don't know
04:44:04 I
04:44:06 I'm not sorry enough to think of it but I
04:44:08 it's not easier to build that kind of game around an RPG
04:44:10 maker type framework than it is to like
04:44:12 code a visual novel from the ground up
04:44:16 okay sure I
04:44:18 guess I'm just like
04:44:20 all right it depends what kind of project it is
04:44:22 like for yeah for some
04:44:24 projects I'm sure that like just
04:44:26 putting just putting together plugins
04:44:28 to achieve a desired
04:44:30 prefab format
04:44:32 is like fine sure
04:44:34 okay
04:44:36 I
04:44:38 recognize a lot of the fucking plugins from
04:44:40 like Lisa the Painful like there's one
04:44:42 where like you go in a room and the light
04:44:44 like like shines around you and it's like
04:44:46 really weird because it's like the only room in the game like that
04:44:48 I was like oh I remember seeing that plugin when I was
04:44:50 fucking around with RPG maker
04:44:52 yeah
04:44:54 oh no don't tell me that a game
04:44:56 that I like use plugins that makes me
04:44:58 Lisa is an RPG maker game
04:45:00 and it uses plugins I promise you
04:45:02 in fact he lists plugins into credits
04:45:04 using plugins it's just a tool
04:45:08 he didn't personally hand code every single thing in that game
04:45:10 even before
04:45:12 I knew about the game when I saw screenshots
04:45:14 I could tell was made an RPG maker
04:45:16 I know it was made an RPG maker
04:45:18 I used it so much
04:45:20 I know it was made an RPG maker but like
04:45:22 okay fine I'm just okay
04:45:24 you know what here's what I think it would be
04:45:26 well if you knew how to
04:45:28 code he wouldn't make it an RPG maker
04:45:30 it would be a better game if he had
04:45:32 hand coded that light
04:45:34 effect
04:45:36 why?
04:45:38 no I'm joking
04:45:40 I basically agree with Ben's
04:45:42 advice that you should code
04:45:44 you shouldn't rely on plugins like he's basically right
04:45:46 I just want to say
04:45:48 it depends on the type of game
04:45:50 I'm being salty
04:45:52 obviously
04:45:54 I guess obviously for something like that
04:45:56 it doesn't matter
04:45:58 I'm just thinking about it
04:46:00 in terms of the game that I've been making
04:46:02 and I literally can't imagine
04:46:04 finding it useful
04:46:06 because I
04:46:08 understand my
04:46:10 I understand my game
04:46:12 like inside and out I know how
04:46:14 all the pieces of it work
04:46:16 and to like just take a big like
04:46:18 black box of code and drop it
04:46:20 in there and be like I hope it does
04:46:22 what I want it to do is unthinkable
04:46:24 it's sort of the equivalent of using
04:46:26 things that some people would consider
04:46:28 crutches in like drawing
04:46:30 like a stabilizer or whatever
04:46:32 it's just a tool that you can use or not
04:46:34 and it's fine
04:46:36 it doesn't make anything good or bad
04:46:38 it just depends on what the final product is
04:46:40 at the end of the day
04:46:42 I'm not arguing from like a
04:46:44 moral standpoint
04:46:46 I'm saying I don't think I could use it
04:46:48 to do anything
04:46:50 when an alternate timeline Ben who loves plugins
04:46:52 would have had phantoms revenge out like six months ago
04:46:54 I
04:46:56 I listen I want it I would
04:46:58 have taken shortcuts if I thought
04:47:00 it would achieve the
04:47:02 effect that I was looking for
04:47:04 but I don't think it would have
04:47:06 so
04:47:08 nobody else should use them either there
04:47:10 that's what I think
04:47:12 a little mouth
04:47:14 I need to use plugins for like After Effects
04:47:16 I don't I try to do everything from scratch using
04:47:18 the built-in things and it's slow
04:47:20 and painful making a game
04:47:22 game maker first of all
04:47:24 why don't you program it from the ground up Ben
04:47:26 like a real adult
04:47:32 game maker
04:47:34 why didn't I
04:47:36 why didn't I write it in notepad
04:47:38 why didn't I code my game in fucking notepad
04:47:40 why didn't you code it in an assembly
04:47:42 why didn't you code it out of raw binary
04:47:46 what do you mold it out of clay you weirdo
04:47:48 I don't know
04:47:50 I'm sorry
04:47:52 that's all I can contribute
04:47:54 I don't know anything about game development
04:47:56 yeah I don't even know anything about game development
04:47:58 so I can't even really have any insight into this
04:48:00 did you farm that silicone yourself for that chip
04:48:02 that's in your computer
04:48:06 did I mind this video
04:48:08 why not cobalt
04:48:10 did you ever see the video about the guy
04:48:12 who like made a sandwich himself like he
04:48:14 did everything like he grew the bread
04:48:16 yeah it was that episode of Spongebob
04:48:18 where Spongebob fight
04:48:20 he does the battle against neptune
04:48:22 and neptune like grows the wheat
04:48:24 he like divinely
04:48:26 makes the wheat grow and then he like
04:48:28 transmutes it into buns
04:48:30 some guy like did that
04:48:32 with like an actual sandwich like he raised the chicken
04:48:34 like he did everything himself
04:48:36 didn't he even like get the water from the ocean
04:48:38 and purify it I forget the exact details
04:48:40 but I wouldn't be surprised if he did something insane like that
04:48:42 and the point is like he did all that it probably cost like a thousand
04:48:44 dollars to do everything put together
04:48:46 and then he like ate the sandwich and he was like
04:48:48 that was okay
04:48:50 fine
04:48:52 and the conclusion this is why capitalism is good
04:48:54 because if you don't have it thousand dollars sandwiches
04:48:58 I mean yeah
04:49:00 markets are
04:49:02 effective
04:49:04 scale is what is the good thing
04:49:06 yeah that's true
04:49:08 scale does not belong to capitalism
04:49:10 it belongs to everyone
04:49:12 division of labor and all that
04:49:14 it's good
04:49:16 next voicemail

04:50:30 liberals taking
04:50:32 L's basically on tiktok
04:50:34 this post was
04:50:36 it was that girl
04:50:38 who makes like seven figures a year
04:50:40 pretending to be a dog
04:50:42 I don't
04:50:44 I am aware of this
04:50:46 she's like a fat
04:50:48 she's like a fetish
04:50:50 she's like a fetish actress
04:50:52 but I don't think I don't even know if she even
04:50:54 like gets nude but like she pretends
04:50:56 to be a dog right she just has a leash
04:50:58 and she acts like a dog
04:51:00 and people pay her an exorbitant amount of money
04:51:02 for this
04:51:04 and the libs of tiktok just posted this like
04:51:06 a gas
04:51:08 it's just like what the fuck am I seeing
04:51:10 and it's like
04:51:12 a video of this girl like
04:51:14 pretending to be a dog

04:51:32 is what it was
04:51:34 um
04:51:36 the libs have really gone too far this time
04:51:38 the libs have gone too far that accounts great
04:51:40 because it will just post like pictures
04:51:42 of like people like committing crimes
04:51:44 and be like lol liberals
04:51:46 just like
04:51:48 there was one of like a bunch of people like smashing
04:51:50 a bunch of windows and like looting a store
04:51:52 and it's just like
04:51:54 like crime is just by default
04:51:56 liberal
04:51:58 be gay do crimes
04:52:00 you know these were liberals because they
04:52:02 broke into a store
04:52:04 you know they voted for Biden
04:52:06 like they loved Kamala
04:52:08 because she
04:52:10 that's why else would they be
04:52:12 stealing you know
04:52:14 I have a pee and drink water
04:52:16 I don't think anyone likes Kamala
04:52:18 who isn't like mmmmmm
04:52:20 are you joking
04:52:22 Kamala was the first woman to hold presidential power
04:52:24 while
04:52:26 Biden was unconscious and sedated
04:52:28 for a routine
04:52:30 colonoscopy and that makes her
04:52:32 a girl boss
04:52:34 that literally sounds like an episode of like veep or something
04:52:36 like that doesn't even sound like it should be
04:52:40 uh it is all
04:52:42 too real

04:54:32 laugh
04:54:34 he was an iconic character
04:54:36 he lives up to his name

04:54:52 oh my god it's true
04:54:54 yeah yeah yeah
04:54:56 there was a brief moment where I was like oh it's not funny

04:55:00 but now thinking back on it I'm laughing inside
04:55:02 I kind of like it
04:55:04 in retrospect it was a good joke
04:55:06 nobody laughs but in retrospect
04:55:08 it was funny I can't wait to see what Mr. Funny Man

04:57:24 oh that's a bit we might actually
04:57:26 we might okay
04:57:28 oh is there a pitch it down two semitones
04:57:30 that actually
04:57:32 did happen remember with the Tom porn
04:57:34 yeah it did
04:57:36 it does occasionally
04:57:38 but it was funny
04:57:40 but I liked it though
04:57:42 I didn't realize you weren't allowed to
04:57:44 link to explicit things in the description
04:57:46 oh yeah
04:57:48 I liked the part where it was about me
04:57:52 same
04:57:54 I liked the part where it said
04:57:56 the shitting on Beatrice
04:57:58 that made me happy
04:58:00 yeah that is a thing
04:58:02 taking a dry dump on Beatrice
04:58:04 is that what I said?
04:58:06 oh yeah
04:58:08 that's what I said
04:58:10 it said dry dump
04:58:12 I remember it said dry dumps
04:58:14 I'm just combining the two ideas
04:58:16 you're just taking
04:58:18 that's called the juxtaposition
04:58:20 and that's the root of all
04:58:22 you're just seething descent
04:58:24 you're just seething
04:58:26 descent
04:58:28 you're just coping
04:58:30 descent right now
04:58:32 okay
04:58:34 next voicemail
04:58:36 is called
04:58:38 mystical hobo
04:58:40 three two one
04:58:42 go
04:58:44 I'm the mystical hobo
04:58:46 of Hoboken
04:58:48 and my question is this
04:58:50 have either of you
04:58:52 or any guests involved
04:58:54 tried meditation
04:58:56 and if not would you
04:58:58 what do you think about meditation
04:59:00 never do you think it's
04:59:02 fucking cringe
04:59:04 and bullshit
04:59:06 I think it's a valid way to soothe
04:59:08 anxiety in this modern age
04:59:10 let me know
04:59:14 I only
04:59:16 engage in negative meditation
04:59:18 which is like regular meditation
04:59:20 but I do it to get angry and pissed off about things
04:59:22 I never tried to meditate to calm down
04:59:24 that seems impossible
04:59:26 I feel like the boundaries
04:59:28 and the rules of meditate
04:59:30 I feel like it works for people who
04:59:32 I don't know
04:59:34 don't need specific instructions
04:59:36 but when people say just
04:59:38 feel the air around you
04:59:40 I'm like okay I feel it
04:59:42 I don't know whether I'm doing anything
04:59:44 right I don't feel it
04:59:46 I don't feel anything I can't do it
04:59:48 it doesn't work it doesn't make sense
04:59:50 these instructions are terrible
04:59:52 I can't get into it no teacher
04:59:54 has ever explained meditation
04:59:56 properly
04:59:58 I'll explain
05:00:00 what it is and what about it works
05:00:02 taking slow deep breaths
05:00:04 that's it
05:00:06 that's the part that has an effect
05:00:08 I don't know
05:00:10 I think there's a little more to it
05:00:12 than that
05:00:14 there's probably a little more to it
05:00:16 but that alone will calm you down
05:00:18 a certain calm
05:00:20 times, spaces
05:00:22 and locations usually
05:00:24 will calm me down
05:00:26 if it's like a nice sunset and there's a cool breeze
05:00:28 and I'm not bothered by anything
05:00:30 and I'm just sitting around
05:00:32 then yeah of course I'll feel calmer
05:00:34 but like I don't know how to
05:00:36 like
05:00:38 create that
05:00:40 when I don't have it
05:00:42 I think
05:00:44 that part of meditation
05:00:46 sometimes is about
05:00:48 imagining
05:00:50 yourself from the outside
05:00:52 like when you're angry
05:00:54 like thinking about
05:00:56 like part of it can be like
05:00:58 thinking about it from the outside
05:01:00 like from an observer
05:01:02 observing your own anger
05:01:04 and thinking about like
05:01:06 why are you angry
05:01:08 and becoming an outside
05:01:10 observer to yourself
05:01:12 and that is a great thing
05:01:14 to be able to do
05:01:16 and if you can do it it's very helpful
05:01:18 in a lot of situations
05:01:20 I feel like I do that all the time though
05:01:22 and that just makes me more upset
05:01:24 because I sort of
05:01:26 there's something different from what you're saying
05:01:28 but like I think to myself
05:01:30 like why am I angry, why am I so stupid
05:01:32 why am I like, why is my life so bad
05:01:34 um
05:01:36 maybe I'm like emotionally compromised
05:01:38 and I can't actually answer those questions properly
05:01:40 but I just end up like berating myself
05:01:42 like there's another version of me
05:01:44 just saying wow give you suck
05:01:46 and here's all of the proof
05:01:48 and I have the receipts and it makes sense
05:01:50 and I'm logically explaining
05:01:52 why you suck so hard
05:01:54 of course
05:01:56 I tried medification
05:01:58 a few times but I could never get like the fighting game
05:02:00 input down and pull off the move
05:02:02 and I kept dropping the combo and failing it
05:02:04 didn't work
05:02:06 I lay on the floor once for like 20 minutes
05:02:08 or maybe 30 minutes once in 2012
05:02:10 and I just lay on the wood floor
05:02:12 and just felt the floor and didn't think about anything
05:02:14 and it was calming
05:02:16 as I have mentioned before
05:02:18 I can only do the, no sorry
05:02:20 no go ahead
05:02:22 I was just gonna say I could only do that when I'm high
05:02:26 as I have mentioned before
05:02:28 um
05:02:30 when I used to do kendo
05:02:32 at the beginning of kendo practice
05:02:34 and at the end we would meditate
05:02:36 for like a few minutes
05:02:38 and the way that
05:02:40 the teacher would have us do that
05:02:42 is we would um
05:02:44 he described it as just sit there
05:02:46 and just deliberately
05:02:48 don't think about anything
05:02:50 and if you have a thought
05:02:52 imagine yourself like
05:02:54 like your mind is like the surface
05:02:56 of like still water
05:02:58 and if any thought disturbs the surface
05:03:00 imagine yourself like
05:03:02 taking the thought and throwing it away
05:03:04 like pluck it out and throw it away
05:03:06 and just like try to sit there
05:03:08 with the least disturbed mind
05:03:10 like no ripples
05:03:12 see I've tried
05:03:14 I've tried to do that before
05:03:16 like I've heard all these things and it's like
05:03:18 I just
05:03:20 I feel like
05:03:22 the metaphors they're using
05:03:24 to describe what you're supposed to do
05:03:26 I interpret them wrong and then I do something wrong
05:03:28 or I don't feel confident enough
05:03:30 that what I'm doing is the right thing
05:03:32 I've never really felt
05:03:34 like
05:03:36 like when I
05:03:38 deliberately tried to do a meditate
05:03:40 I can't do it
05:03:42 I felt calm before
05:03:44 but like I don't know how
05:03:46 the things people say to explain it
05:03:48 don't make any sense to me and I can't make sense of them
05:03:52 I get the feeling meditation is almost
05:03:54 one of those psychosomatic things where like
05:03:56 if you believe it it'll
05:03:58 have a perceived effect for you like almost like
05:04:00 a placebo kind of thing
05:04:02 that's probably a really mean way of talking about it
05:04:04 but to me that's the impression we've got
05:04:06 because I was doubtful of it and tried it
05:04:08 I fully believe that's what it is
05:04:10 it's that combined with the fact that you're probably
05:04:12 like breathing slower
05:04:14 and calm which does actually calm you down
05:04:16 whenever I'm agitated
05:04:18 I just take a deep breath
05:04:20 and that like helps
05:04:22 it's like a bit of that
05:04:24 it's not just about
05:04:26 being calm
05:04:28 it's not merely about
05:04:30 becoming calmer
05:04:32 from a state of upset
05:04:34 it's about like
05:04:36 I don't know I think if you do it right
05:04:38 it changes your
05:04:40 perspective a little bit and it gets you
05:04:42 it gets you into a
05:04:44 sort of a mood or a mindset
05:04:46 that is just more
05:04:48 focused and better
05:04:50 unless stupid
05:04:52 my form of
05:04:54 meditation is playing the first 200 turns
05:04:56 of a Civilization 6 game
05:04:58 and then going sleep
05:05:00 I mean
05:05:02 good breathing exercises
05:05:04 are also good for focus
05:05:06 I feel like if there's anything
05:05:08 oxygen flow to your brain
05:05:10 I think the only thing that's
05:05:12 like been consistently
05:05:14 a good thing to calm me down or focus
05:05:16 like if I'm having like
05:05:18 an anxiety moment
05:05:20 is to go outside only if it's like
05:05:22 really cold it works
05:05:24 and I just lay on like the earth
05:05:26 I lay on the ground on the stone
05:05:28 and I just become
05:05:30 really cold
05:05:32 I don't know why that helps
05:05:34 and then I come in and I'm shivering
05:05:36 but it's like now I can warm up
05:05:38 and now my brain is not
05:05:40 like I don't know foggy
05:05:46 I need one of those ice waterfalls
05:05:48 to sit under
05:05:54 one of them good old ice waterfalls
05:05:56 get that installed in the back garden
05:05:58 you need a
05:06:00 Joe Rogan freezing cold
05:06:02 flotation thing
05:06:04 is that like a sunbed
05:06:06 no what are those things
05:06:08 called where you lay inside of a thing
05:06:12 a sensory deprivation chamber
05:06:14 but like a cold
05:06:18 I'm sure you could make
05:06:22 I like the cool air
05:06:24 it's definitely something I appreciate
05:06:30 well that's the last voicemail
05:06:32 I thought we were going to go
05:06:34 for another 58,000 years
05:06:38 and I would die in collapse
05:06:40 no there weren't that many
05:06:42 but we are past the eight hour mark
05:06:44 so eight hours
05:06:46 no we really uh
05:06:48 sorry five hours
05:06:50 I meant five
05:06:52 well you heard him we have to go for another
05:06:54 three hours we were at five
05:06:56 hours and eight minutes on my
05:06:58 audacity and I fucked it up
05:07:00 I fucked it
05:07:04 you imagine ever putting out an eight hour episode
05:07:06 I have done that
05:07:08 well not a pcp but like
05:07:10 arm retrieval I think the last episode
05:07:12 was like almost eight hours
05:07:14 was it
05:07:16 god
05:07:18 dang
05:07:20 went all the way through the night and it was the sun was coming up
05:07:22 holy moly
05:07:24 by the time we had finished
05:07:26 that's a real ass
05:07:28 podcast
05:07:30 none of that is five hour bullshit
05:07:32 since we are since I imagine we're coming
05:07:34 since I imagine we're coming up on the end
05:07:36 I will take this opportunity to say
05:07:38 by plebe and the wee blue rays

05:08:10 what a deal it is a deal
05:08:12 it's not that bad
05:08:14 it's pretty
05:08:16 you can't afford not to
05:08:18 you literally can't afford not to
05:08:20 I can't afford you not to
05:08:22 please
05:08:24 but you the viewer could technically afford not to do it
05:08:26 no no that's not
05:08:28 what I that's not the right message
05:08:30 shhh cyber show shut the fuck up
05:08:32 okay
05:08:34 just reminding you
05:08:36 I just want to say if you're
05:08:38 if you're listening the PCP in 2022
05:08:40 but you're like
05:08:42 you got cash
05:08:44 I'm not a real PCP yeah I'm not going to buy
05:08:46 plebe and the weeb like who the fuck are you
05:08:48 honestly you're so right
05:08:50 you're so right like imagine
05:08:52 you'd be like you're listening to this stupid podcast
05:08:54 you're one of the like
05:08:56 10% of people
05:08:58 who are still here after all this shit
05:09:00 you're still like six years later
05:09:02 and you're like I remember
05:09:04 the plebe and the weeb red con too
05:09:06 but
05:09:08 am I interested in owning
05:09:10 an exclusive one of the kind
05:09:12 piece of that history
05:09:14 I'm ambivalent
05:09:16 like what's wrong with you
05:09:18 Ben now that you've said that
05:09:20 you need to check what this episode gets
05:09:22 in the first week in terms of views
05:09:24 and make a print exactly that
05:09:26 I think you're right
05:09:28 I think I
05:09:30 honestly I would expect someone
05:09:32 that's still invested after all this time
05:09:34 yeah I would expect the viewership to 100%
05:09:36 be like I'll pay anything
05:09:40 you viewers do you even understand
05:09:42 when you own this Blu-ray
05:09:44 you can just like hold it in your hand
05:09:46 just you owning that would make Trixie mad
05:09:48 like just existing
05:09:50 honestly
05:09:52 you got to do it like that live streamer
05:09:54 low tier god and say like I'm not even going to start
05:09:56 the stream or the podcast until you guys pay me
05:09:58 enough money to talk to you
05:10:00 the fact that they are all coordinated
05:10:02 like deliberately not
05:10:04 saying anything about it makes it really obvious
05:10:06 that like yes they are definitely
05:10:08 pissed off about it and it would upset
05:10:10 them a lot if
05:10:12 the more they got sold
05:10:14 you really would have expected some kind
05:10:16 of comment right at least be like
05:10:18 oh this is bad Ben shouldn't have done this
05:10:20 because you know he's profiting off my work
05:10:22 or something like I would expect
05:10:24 something like that
05:10:26 at least a diss track
05:10:28 I think I do expect something
05:10:30 but I think it'll probably get
05:10:32 maybe commented on and like avoid gazers
05:10:34 or something I think they will
05:10:36 I don't know
05:10:38 yeah they're doing that
05:10:40 they're doing a Q&A at some point aren't they
05:10:42 they'll probably mention at the end of that
05:10:44 I just find it impossible to imagine that she's not annoyed
05:10:46 like there's no way that she's just like
05:10:48 that's fine I don't care that Ben's doing that
05:10:50 you know what I mean
05:10:52 I know that she is because I know
05:10:54 that Riley would respond
05:10:56 to the tweets that I've made at him
05:10:58 because it's more engagement than he usually gets on twitter
05:11:00 there's no way he doesn't see them
05:11:02 the only reason he wouldn't engage with them
05:11:04 is if Trixie was like don't engage with them
05:11:06 please
05:11:08 like I just want to ignore it until it goes away
05:11:10 like she's told him not to
05:11:12 that's the only explanation
05:11:14 also they've been deleting comments about it
05:11:16 on their
05:11:18 on their channel so
05:11:20 that's amazing
05:11:22 I've seen a few comments that have
05:11:24 that have disappeared
05:11:26 the rise and fall
05:11:28 ah oh shit my headphones fell out
05:11:30 okay anyway
05:11:32 I just wanted to remind everyone
05:11:34 to please give me money
05:11:38 can I also
05:11:40 ask for money
05:11:42 I will ask to
05:11:44 you the viewer should
05:11:46 if you're not going to donate to Ben's saint
05:11:48 for whatever reason you should consider giving money to laserbot
05:11:50 because he could really use it
05:11:52 yeah I just
05:11:54 did you know Trixie is making like three times as much
05:11:56 as Tails gets trolled is
05:11:58 that sounds
05:12:00 that sounds about right
05:12:02 bad timeline
05:12:04 yeah
05:12:06 laserbot's making three times as much quality content
05:12:10 I know
05:12:12 we're getting money from
05:12:16 infinity
05:12:18 it's actually
05:12:20 I spit the inside of my mouth and I'm in pain
05:12:22 but I'm gonna sold drawn
05:12:24 good work
05:12:26 we actually need more money than usual
05:12:28 because we have to pay all the artists too
05:12:30 yeah I mean
05:12:32 we have to divide it amongst ourselves
05:12:34 well I'm not taking any but
05:12:36 that latest page
05:12:38 I forget what you said the artist's name was
05:12:40 like that person definitely deserves to be
05:12:42 paid for that
05:12:44 yeah
05:12:46 yeah I paid them
05:12:48 there's been some really good guest art
05:12:50 so yeah obviously
05:12:52 it's easier to pay good artists
05:12:54 than just to beg them to do free good art for you
05:12:56 yeah
05:12:58 yeah
05:13:00 that's the whole reason the Patreon exists
05:13:02 I would encourage people
05:13:04 to support
05:13:06 the ongoing
05:13:08 like you said earlier
05:13:10 Cybershell like
05:13:12 like wow
05:13:14 tails gets trolled is actually putting out regular
05:13:16 pages like that's kind of
05:13:18 crazy
05:13:20 it is honestly
05:13:22 it was over
05:13:24 it was dead
05:13:26 luckily CC
05:13:28 had to help revive it
05:13:30 with the help of laserbot
05:13:32 and Embergram and a bunch of other people
05:13:34 but CC did a lot
05:13:36 well actually
05:13:38 I guess this is a big deal to people
05:13:40 but laserbot actually came back
05:13:42 oh yeah I forgot
05:13:44 he probably even announced that on the podcast
05:13:46 yeah cause he like left the project but now he's back on the project
05:13:48 and you know he'll do pages
05:13:50 I didn't know that
05:13:52 I almost was going to be like
05:13:54 when you first announced he left I was almost going to be like
05:13:56 you know you could just not announce it
05:13:58 because maybe he'll come back someday
05:14:00 but I didn't want to
05:14:02 you should be transparent you should be honest
05:14:04 people would want to know why is
05:14:06 the art not his
05:14:08 but part of me was hoping maybe he'll come back
05:14:10 but I didn't want to jinx it and be like
05:14:12 cause you never know
05:14:14 I went along with those guys
05:14:16 I actually thought about that
05:14:18 I wish I didn't
05:14:20 I wish I didn't
05:14:22 say he was leaving because
05:14:24 5 million people retweeted that
05:14:26 and then I said oh actually he's coming back
05:14:28 like nobody
05:14:30 it's not as exciting to people who aren't invested
05:14:32 in the comic you know where he's always leaving
05:14:34 even if you don't know anything about the comic
05:14:36 you can sort of be like oh that's big news
05:14:38 I see
05:14:40 they wrote the whole article about it
05:14:42 on Know Your Meme
05:14:44 whatever
05:14:46 but what can you do
05:14:48 it'll be fine like he's going to continue doing pages
05:14:50 and most people
05:14:52 especially as the time goes on will that
05:14:54 announcement fade from people's memory
05:14:56 yeah I think it's already
05:14:58 started to fade because
05:15:00 people used to think the comic was cancelled
05:15:02 but I think most people
05:15:04 don't
05:15:06 also the Five Nights at Freddy's thing helped
05:15:08 I mean the Five Nights at Funkin
05:15:10 Friday Night Funkin
05:15:12 yeah
05:15:14 Five Nights at Funkin
05:15:16 you don't know about that Ben?
05:15:18 well I know what the game is
05:15:20 there's a Tails gets trolled mod
05:15:22 for Friday Night Funkin
05:15:24 do you remember last time
05:15:26 ages and ages ago I was like dude Ben
05:15:28 I don't have the most
05:15:30 viewed Tails gets trolled video on YouTube
05:15:32 and I have number 2 and you were like oh Pog
05:15:34 dude now there's like some Friday Night Funkin
05:15:36 video with over a million views
05:15:38 that like loads of shit
05:15:40 just search Tails gets trolled on YouTube right now
05:15:42 and you'll see what we're talking about
05:15:44 there's probably like multiple videos
05:15:46 oh yeah there's multiple videos showing off the mod
05:15:48 that all have more than our shit
05:15:50 yeah the first result
05:15:52 Friday Night Funkin versus Sonic and Tails
05:15:54 gets trolled 2.0
05:15:56 and Tails
05:15:58 okay
05:16:00 I can't get mad at it even though
05:16:02 it's introducing a ton of new people to comic
05:16:04 it's ultimately a good thing
05:16:06 as far as I'm concerned
05:16:08 but they are consumers
05:16:10 and they are cringe for not knowing
05:16:12 about Tails gets trolled already
05:16:14 well this is a shocking development
05:16:16 damn
05:16:18 I should have been on the internet for 30 years
05:16:20 like we were
05:16:22 oh you passed me Cybershell
05:16:24 the biggest
05:16:26 it's Friday Night Funkin with 1.4 million
05:16:28 and then you with just under 600k
05:16:30 and then my lecture
05:16:32 with 530k
05:16:34 and then after that is
05:16:36 Tails gets trolled is back
05:16:38 PCP episode with 22k
05:16:40 and then it's
05:16:42 chapter 1
05:16:44 part 1 of is it the audio
05:16:46 book after that?
05:16:48 I wish the audio comic book
05:16:50 or whatever the proper term for it had more views
05:16:52 like the ultimate Tails gets trolled
05:16:54 although that one is sort of split because there was an original
05:16:56 Tails gets trolled channel that uploaded the first
05:16:58 4 videos or whatever
05:17:00 and that one's got 180k
05:17:02 and then the ultimate Tails gets trolled
05:17:04 the latest one has 12k views
05:17:06 which I think is the most
05:17:08 maybe I'm not sure
05:17:10 I don't know if you can answer like an ultimate
05:17:12 but it's less
05:17:14 that channel's only got 8000
05:17:16 chapter 8 got 57k
05:17:18 so some of them are a bit bigger
05:17:20 ok
05:17:21 I still think
05:17:22 still more people watch the audio drama
05:17:24 than the
05:17:26 read the comic because I hear people say
05:17:28 oh you know the Friday Night Funkin' Mom got me to
05:17:30 watch the original
05:17:32 to watch the original
05:17:34 ah
05:17:36 it's the game of the anime of the manga
05:17:38 well I mean if you live on YouTube
05:17:40 maybe you just
05:17:42 just think
05:17:44 I guess if you've never heard of it before
05:17:46 YouTubers were all in creative endeavors that originate from
05:17:48 YouTube
05:17:50 well whatever
05:17:52 as long as people are enjoying
05:17:54 the content
05:17:56 you know
05:17:58 who cares if they watch it sub
05:18:00 or read the manga, watch the anime
05:18:02 so we're all fans
05:18:04 speaking of enjoying content
05:18:06 is this the longest PCP episode now
05:18:08 or are we still not beat that last week
05:18:10 it's gotta be close
05:18:12 I don't know
05:18:14 I don't know the exact count
05:18:16 because I started my audacity recording way earlier
05:18:18 so I'm at like 5.30
05:18:20 but I know we're only at like 5.10
05:18:22 5.15 is something like that
05:18:24 that sounds about right
05:18:26 that's pretty long
05:18:28 yeah I'm 5.20
05:18:30 if it's not the longest it's probably
05:18:32 I need to go get some food I'm hungry as fuck
