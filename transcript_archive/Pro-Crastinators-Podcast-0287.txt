00:00:36 We're starting another Ben cast will it conclude a Ben cast or will we have a or will we have a new interruption?
00:00:44 We have some such an inconsiderate interruption as the last time
00:00:50 Only time we'll tell but you know what this means. This is my opportunity to phone it in. Oh my god
00:01:01 Did you wait until I started what no I didn't know you had started I was sorry I was late
00:01:08 you idiot I
00:01:10 Literally just started like a minute ago. Well, I guess it looks like I'm on time
00:01:18 All right
00:01:20 Very good very very nice. Hi Gib. How you doing? Hey, I'm good
00:01:28 Okay, sure are you recording I am yes, okay cool very very nice
00:01:36 What's going on
00:01:38 Uh
00:01:40 Nothing I was just playing I was just playing a even colony
00:01:44 On which is free on the epic store, but now it will
00:01:49 until November 11th
00:01:52 So you you've you've missed it if you're listening to this lol
00:01:57 I guess I'll I guess I'll google it. It's uh, it's like a city
00:02:02 Simulator building thing but on space
00:02:06 New planets and
00:02:08 It's it's pretty good. It's pretty nice
00:02:10 You got your you got your buildings and you got your immigration to for new residents. You got your housing
00:02:17 air filtration
00:02:19 farming
00:02:20 Pretty good. I I have never really played a city builder games
00:02:25 Although I think I can understand the appeal
00:02:28 I've just I've just never really really delved into the genre
00:02:33 I have played a lot of them
00:02:35 uh
00:02:37 Actually, I guess I've played sim city 3000 a million years ago
00:02:41 And and some other like tangentially related stuff
00:02:45 I like I like city building in in like the the the
00:02:50 The uh
00:02:52 Oh, what is it? What do you call it when it's like stats and figures?
00:02:57 When you're over viewing all of the all of the numbers
00:03:00 Spreadsheets
00:03:02 Yeah in the spreadsheet fashion. I don't know how to describe it
00:03:05 But it's like nice like balancing all of the food intake and food
00:03:10 You know consumption you can ration things
00:03:13 Sure. Yeah
00:03:15 I had a I had I had a version of sim city on like fucking windows 3.1
00:03:22 Uh
00:03:22 Like I had a really old like it came that had sim city and sim or like I think the original ones
00:03:28 And I that was when I was a kid and I and I found them I found them impenetrable
00:03:33 Uh, I couldn't really understand them. So, uh
00:03:37 Didn't end up playing a lot of them
00:03:39 Uh, I would fuck around with them and like like try and make natural disasters happen
00:03:45 Uh, and that was like pretty much all the enjoyment I could get out of them
00:03:49 Because I was an idiot
00:03:51 Yeah, there's like there's usually a point where it's like it's so big
00:03:56 That either it's too big to fail and then there's no like challenge anymore
00:04:01 Like you've got too many completely filled storage
00:04:05 Things and it's like you're never gonna run out of food or water or anything
00:04:08 And you're too powerful to be killed by an invasion
00:04:12 So like natural disasters are the the only thing that can like
00:04:16 Like make it tense again, but they're also annoying to deal with because of how many things break
00:04:22 Yeah
00:04:23 Well, I mean, that's the that's the point you that that's the point but like you're annoying yourself. Yeah
00:04:28 There's a point in in a lot of these games where like I haven't reached that point in even colony
00:04:33 I'm sure it'll get there where like
00:04:35 There's no challenge or it's too challenging and too stressful
00:04:43 My favorite, uh, just like real life
00:04:47 Yeah, my favorite city building things are one where like
00:04:50 The it's it's more casual, but like the real fun is going down into your city and exploring it
00:04:58 Oh, right you can do that and some of these kind of like how
00:05:04 Kind of like how
00:05:05 Or couldn't you do that in the roller coaster tycoon?
00:05:08 Yeah, all of the tycoon games where you can
00:05:10 Uh, like theme park world as well
00:05:13 Yeah, you can make your theme park you can make your roller coasters and then you can ride them
00:05:18 You can walk around zoo tycoon. I love all those fucking
00:05:21 I've I've also never played a I've never played a tycoon
00:05:26 I never played what I cool
00:05:28 Zoo tycoon's good because you can get a lion and you can just pick it up out of the enclosure and put it
00:05:33 Into the normal part of the park and people will scream
00:05:37 Will they die they'll scream and run and the lion will not really kill anyone
00:05:42 Unless no wait, I think the lion can kill people
00:05:45 What's the point of a lion if it can't kill people?
00:05:47 I think it can kill people and then like the park rangers are like, oh shit
00:05:51 They dart it. That's what I would shoot it shoot it with sleep darts and then it gets put in a cage
00:05:57 And suddenly it becomes an RTF suddenly becomes tower defense as you put more lions out of the cages
00:06:03 that there was this zoo tycoon like like expansion pack
00:06:08 for like
00:06:10 Like dinosaurs where you could make you could unearth like fossils go to a research station
00:06:16 and then like ala pokemon create dinosaurs with the fossils
00:06:21 And and then you can just have dinosaurs and then if you break the thing the dinosaurs will go on the on the rampage
00:06:28 And try to kill people just like Jurassic park and then you can go down into first person view
00:06:34 and like use like the the the special harpoon gun to like
00:06:39 Like put it to sleep again
00:06:42 And that's what I used to like doing. I used to like getting a bunch of dinosaurs and then becoming an fps in zoo tycoon
00:06:51 That's just great
00:06:53 Just play just play a game that works. You're supposed to shoot dinosaurs. No because then they're hard
00:06:59 They'll they're like, oh the dinosaurs have a lot of hp and they'll kill you. It's like that's not what I want
00:07:05 No, no, I want
00:07:07 It's not games to be easy and never challenging
00:07:10 I can't get off to shooting dinosaurs in a context where I'm supposed to be shooting them
00:07:14 I want to feel like I really shouldn't be shooting these dinosaurs. That's that's what does it for me
00:07:20 uh
00:07:22 It's the transgressive element of it that really gets my that really activates my neurons
00:07:28 Yeah, uh
00:07:30 I'm trying to think if I ever play at any fucking any good video game in my in my whole damn life
00:07:36 No, uh, yeah, I have the old really old sims on my old ass computer. Um
00:07:46 No, I've just played fucking jrpg is like a fucking nerd
00:07:50 I mean those can be good
00:07:52 No, they fucking can't you could you can have like an a story and it's like you've watched a a movie
00:07:57 That's the worst over the course of like 170 hours. God. I would
00:08:02 I would never watch a movie
00:08:05 Uh, uh
00:08:10 Yeah, I fucking hate movies
00:08:12 What a waste of time am I right? I hate me. Uh true movies movies are always like in that
00:08:19 awkward spot of
00:08:21 Like they're too long to just casually put on and like I need a break
00:08:27 But then you're you're like fucking up the pacing of the movie if you take a break
00:08:31 So you feel compelled to like watch it all in one go, but it's a little bit too long to watch all in one go
00:08:38 I actually watched uh, I was cajoled into watching a movie
00:08:42 I was I was plied with alcohol and then coerced into watching a movie that I would never have consented to
00:08:48 Is it the my old pony movie?
00:08:51 No, no, no, this was on halloween. Uh, we watched uh, we watched uh house or house or house or you know the japanese
00:08:59 Uh horror movie the old one. I do not know that
00:09:03 Um, I had heard of it. Uh, I don't like horror movies and I was I don't watch horror movies on halloween
00:09:09 I know ha ha that's what you do on halloween, but like I hate that shit. I don't want to do it
00:09:13 Uh, but they got me to do it and it was fine because it's it's a movie
00:09:17 It's old enough that like the special effects are not convincing at all
00:09:21 And so it's just kind of silly
00:09:23 Well, I mean it was legitimately creepy at times because you could tell what they were going for and what they were going for
00:09:28 was pretty creepy, but I wasn't like
00:09:30 You know, it was fine, uh and uh
00:09:33 very
00:09:35 Very compelling the cinematography was very weird and interesting and they did
00:09:41 The movie started with like just lots of like
00:09:45 It starts really weird it starts
00:09:48 in like a very self-aware sort of like
00:09:51 parody
00:09:52 Of like of like a like a like a lighthearted drama
00:09:55 But they have all these uh, they have all these these scene transitions of like
00:10:00 The the one thing we we kept noticing was that the the there are all these like painted background
00:10:05 There's like very obviously painted backgrounds in like every scene you can really tell like that's not a real sky
00:10:11 Like that's a painting and then at some point they start like
00:10:15 putting characters in front of
00:10:17 Paintings and you think oh, it's more painted backgrounds
00:10:20 But then the camera will move and you'll see like no wait
00:10:22 They're actually just standing in front of like a mural at their school
00:10:25 Uh, uh, that was one weird thing that was very disorienting about it. Uh, uh
00:10:31 I don't know it's hard
00:10:33 I could probably talk a lot about house, but it's really interesting. I've seen I've seen the poster of this cat
00:10:39 with the big lip
00:10:41 teeth
00:10:42 Yeah
00:10:43 Yeah
00:10:44 The cat was just kind of
00:10:46 There at the end only at the very end was I like oh, I guess that's why the cat's on the poster
00:10:51 Okay, sure
00:10:55 Is it if I just search house movie I typed in house japan movie and I got it. Yeah
00:11:02 um
00:11:04 What else could I there were there were
00:11:07 Yeah, the the the
00:11:09 Like the kills are very
00:11:12 It's not like a slasher like people don't get like killed by a person. They basically get like
00:11:17 they basically get like
00:11:19 sort of
00:11:20 separated into pieces by some sort of like
00:11:24 the the
00:11:25 magical force
00:11:27 of the house itself and like their
00:11:31 Pieces will like keep doing things that like they were doing while they were alive like uh
00:11:38 The the the the girl who eats all the time like
00:11:41 She like falls down a well and like her head gets separated and like they find the head and the head tries to like bite them
00:11:47 And like one girl is like playing a piano
00:11:49 And like the piano eats her and then they find like they find like her disembodied fingers like are still like are still like
00:11:56 You know playing the keys of the keyboard and stuff
00:12:01 This is a spoiler but like
00:12:03 One of the girls is named kung fu
00:12:06 and she's just like tough and does karate or whatever or kung fu I suppose and um
00:12:12 She's like the last she's like one of the last ones to die
00:12:14 I think like the house is going like crazy the house is like really like
00:12:18 You know the ghost is like all right. No more fucking around. It's time to kill all you motherfuckers
00:12:23 And uh, she starts like she does she's like doing karate
00:12:26 But like she gets sucked into like a closet or a mirror or something. I don't even remember but like
00:12:30 Her like but like after she does like her like legs and her like hands like come out and her legs just like continue doing
00:12:37 Like karate kicks like against like the ghost
00:12:40 Uh, I just started like bloody disembodied like legs just kicking
00:12:46 Very amusing. It was very cool. It was very cool
00:12:50 Uh, yeah a a rare w a rare w for cinema as a whole
00:12:56 I thought you were gonna say a rare w for the nation of japan
00:13:00 That that too that too. Yeah, finally they've contributed something to culture
00:13:06 Um, apparently the director also made a live action the girl who leapt through time
00:13:11 Which I guess is based on a book
00:13:15 Oh, you know that that that anime movie go through like time
00:13:19 I've seen the anime. I think I thought it was an original. I didn't know it was based on a on a book
00:13:27 Did the live action version come before the anime?
00:13:29 Uh, 1983 so I think so
00:13:32 Uh girl who
00:13:36 Yeah, the movie was 2006. Oh, I didn't know that I had no idea. Um pretty neat pretty neat
00:13:48 I don't know. I don't know what else to say about it
00:13:50 Um, is that the same guy who did summer wars right summer boys some it's not summer boys
00:13:56 Summer boys and that was okay. Okay. Am I crazy?
00:13:59 But the summer wars is the movie by the guy who made the digimon movie
00:14:03 But like the digimon movie was really good
00:14:05 Yes, you're thinking of it's the right person
00:14:07 And then and then he was like, wow, I wish I like I wasted my great idea on the digimon movie
00:14:12 I'm gonna go make the movie again, but not digimon this time
00:14:15 I'm gonna make it my own movie and that was summer wars, right, right
00:14:19 I
00:14:20 Think so
00:14:21 This is a story that I feel like I've heard repeated many times
00:14:26 Uh
00:14:29 Uh, yeah, yeah, this is all it's all the I have the pieces of this story in my in my mind
00:14:37 But but but scattered but separated you might say into their various pieces and they continue to do
00:14:43 They continue to do things in the house of my mind. Hmm
00:14:47 curious
00:14:50 Yes, he did the digimon adventure. He did the go through it through time summer wars
00:14:54 Yeah, and then wolf children more recently
00:14:58 Uh another one I have not I have not seen wolf children wolf wolf children wolf children is that one that has
00:15:06 That scene right didn't like Trixie talk about that scene one time where like
00:15:11 It's like the kids growing up and it's like one shot from like the side of the house
00:15:15 And like you see them like living their life in the house as they like get older or whatever
00:15:20 I have no recollection and it's like one shot from one one side of that
00:15:24 It's just one like cut out shot of the house and you see them dude
00:15:26 I filmed this anime movie in a single take and yeah, they did it in one take
00:15:31 They drew it in one take
00:15:33 No, we're racing
00:15:36 Yeah
00:15:40 House is cool house was a good movie
00:15:43 I got
00:15:44 I was I was I was getting drunk, but I didn't start drunk and I and I was uh and I
00:15:49 Even even at the beginning while I was mostly sober. I was like, oh this
00:15:53 The tone of the tone of this movie is very weird very interesting and and and I'm engaged
00:15:59 And so I was
00:16:03 Yeah, do you do anything on Halloween?
00:16:06 Uh, oh
00:16:07 you know
00:16:09 Not really in fact, I was we were recording the pcp on halloween. Yeah, we recorded it in the in the morning
00:16:16 Uh, but for me that was like
00:16:19 Oh, right. It was like 3 p.m. Going into like going into the beginning of the afternoon. Obviously it was dark
00:16:24 So like it was trick-or-treaters happening near the end
00:16:28 And I will I really there
00:16:30 Oh, that's pretty really like maybe just after we'd finish recording. It gets dark at 6 p.m. For you. Well. Yes winter
00:16:39 I mean it gets dark pretty early. I think it gets dark around like seven or eight this year
00:16:42 Uh
00:16:45 I forget how long we went but yeah, that was happening and I
00:16:49 Earlier in the day had carved the the jack-o-lantern and I was like that's that's a good one
00:16:54 I think I was it was pretty good
00:16:57 And then that was put outside and that's it. I didn't really answer the door because I don't like doing that
00:17:02 I didn't have a costume because I never remember to do that through the whole of october
00:17:06 And I was like, well, whatever
00:17:08 And then as soon as halloween was over I was like, you know what I'm ready
00:17:12 I'm ready for halloween now
00:17:16 And that's how it always goes. I'm always ready for halloween after halloween is over
00:17:20 Well, it's easy to be ready when it's too late and you can't do and there's nothing to be done
00:17:25 Yeah, but like spooky stuff Howard's way out spooky stuff is fun
00:17:29 Like like quote-unquote spooky because I you know, I have a pumpkin oc is my main character that I use for things
00:17:36 So I just use I just do that all year
00:17:39 I don't feel compelled to only do it during halloween. So I can just do it now. I can just do halloween
00:17:45 You know november if I wanted
00:17:47 And it would consist of me watching a scary movie
00:17:51 And drawing a picture of a scary thing
00:17:54 It's it's true. It time is merely an illusion. The calendar is a human invention
00:18:01 It's merely a it's merely a social construct in fact
00:18:06 You know, you could dress like a goth whenever you want
00:18:09 That's true. You don't have to do it. That's true specific night. And you should do it all the time
00:18:16 If you want to be cool
00:18:18 Just like me in high school
00:18:21 Um
00:18:23 How how goth where are you been? I was uh, I was not the most goth. I was a bit of a
00:18:29 I was a bit of a poser, you know, I had some I had some trip pants
00:18:33 I had a couple of pieces of hot topic jewelry
00:18:36 I spiked my hair a little bit, but uh, I wasn't like, uh
00:18:42 I didn't like go to like I had a couple friends who went to like like, you know rock shows and stuff
00:18:47 Like like, you know local bands and whatever. I didn't really do that
00:18:50 uh
00:18:52 uh, I just
00:18:55 I was I was like
00:18:57 Five out of ten goth, you know
00:19:00 Uh, so like I was a bit of a hanger on just kind of all my friends were doing it. So I did it too. They I'll be I'll be honest
00:19:07 trip pants. I never actually had trip pants
00:19:11 No, you should get some you should fucking get some I they they look like like
00:19:18 The goth equivalent of like flares, you know, you know, uh, uh, what do they say? Uh, they say, you know, the millennials
00:19:24 Millennials are still wearing, you know, um, skinny jeans
00:19:27 But like among zoomers, you know, the big like baggy jinkos are coming back in style
00:19:32 I feel like the trip pants should come back along with that trend
00:19:36 I think that would be some of them look cool
00:19:38 But some of them definitely look like restrictive in an in an annoying way like chains connected. Well, they're not they're not built for
00:19:45 They're not built for performance skip
00:19:49 But they're built for performing honestly, I'm feeling I'm feeling
00:19:54 Stupid I oh I feel like maybe I should get some
00:19:58 And just wear them. Well, I already I already look I already looked like a fucking moron in public
00:20:04 I already dressed like a fucking child like a complete imbecile
00:20:07 Why not just go all out, right? Yeah
00:20:11 they're funny
00:20:12 I
00:20:13 Have like always been like, oh fashion that's for like if you're look at look at this shit
00:20:20 I've never really been like, oh, I'm gonna do like a an outfit. It's like too
00:20:26 Feels like too much of a statement. I don't want people to notice
00:20:29 But I I feel like I should not necessarily trip pants, but like
00:20:33 Something a statement, right? Yeah, make it. Yeah making a statement some of those like huge puffy like cute like sneakers
00:20:41 That I've seen I guess these are like girl pants

00:22:48 But also I'm losing weight again because I'm working out again and I've
00:22:52 But also just kind of the stuff from before just I sort of don't want like I don't have anything
00:22:56 That's like really good and I'm like excited to wear it again. So like
00:23:00 Fuck it. I should just get some new shit
00:23:03 Um, but maybe I should wait until I lose a little more weight because I am on I'm on I'm pretty on track with that
00:23:09 And like what would be the point of buying, you know
00:23:13 Fat pants at the moment when like if they'll be too big for me in like a couple months
00:23:18 Well, that's why you get trip pants because they got like they got belts so you can adjust. Yeah. Yeah, true. Yeah, true
00:23:24 Um, you can tighten it with the belts halfway down if you want to show off your knees
00:23:30 Um the shape of your knee or something
00:23:33 But every every I don't know every time I go
00:23:35 It's been it's been it's been a while since I've like gone
00:23:39 Clothes shopping and and it's been even longer since I've gone clothes shopping and found anything that I like
00:23:44 Usually I'll go someplace and I'll be ah, I'm gonna look for something like yeah
00:23:47 I'm gonna look for something that's cool and that is like my vibe and then like makes a statement
00:23:51 Right and I know, you know, that sounds like such an easy thing
00:23:55 But then like it's so hard to actually find something like that
00:23:58 I feel like to find shit like that you have to be like making an active effort
00:24:02 You have to be like going out and like clothes shopping like regularly and once in a while you will come across something that is like
00:24:09 This is just what I'm looking for
00:24:11 This is something that I'm like excited to wear and then I think is is gonna like, you know
00:24:15 Bring my ensemble together. That's not something you can just casually stumble upon which is sad and demotivating
00:24:23 Because it's like damn. What if I just go out to the garment district or whatever and I look around and like
00:24:29 There's just nothing good there because usually there's just nothing good
00:24:33 That's like, what was the point? Why did I even leave my house? Why do I even get out of bed this morning?
00:24:38 Nobody knows no one can answer that you could you could learn to build your own clothing out of
00:24:44 scratch
00:24:46 That's a hole. That's a hole over here
00:24:49 That's a whole other fucking can of worms right there and even harder
00:24:54 Even harder
00:25:00 Let me complain I'm gonna complain about something. Uh, yeah, nobody
00:25:05 Nobody wants free money
00:25:08 I haven't I have been preaching I have been preaching the word about free money
00:25:12 for months now
00:25:14 And nobody cares nobody listens
00:25:18 Because I'm offering the car journey. It's it's car. Yeah. I I um
00:25:24 I asked on twitter
00:25:25 The other day it was a bit stew. I felt a bit stupid asking but I couldn't think of a good reason not to ask
00:25:31 So I made a tweet a tweet about like does anyone want since I've been talking about credit cards
00:25:35 Does anyone want to sign up for a good one? I have a bunch of good ones that I recommend
00:25:40 And if you sign up for one with my uh, uh
00:25:43 Six with my referral code, I will get they will give me a bonus
00:25:48 So you the sign-upber will get, you know
00:25:52 Cashback offers and you know the the um, what's the word?
00:25:55 Yeah, the sign-up bonus, you know
00:25:56 For instance like $200 bonus cash when you spend $500 with the card for instance. That's one of the good sign-up bonuses
00:26:04 Uh, so it's good for you and also they'll give me like a hundred bucks if if I sign you up
00:26:09 And so I don't know I would really
00:26:12 I have a I can make I can make up to like $500 if I find five people
00:26:17 Who would sign up for such a thing and I think
00:26:20 That there are probably people who aren't who don't use credit cards who should be using them
00:26:25 I genuinely feel like I would be doing people a service if I got them to sign up for
00:26:30 Many people not everyone most people if I got them one of these cards
00:26:34 And so I don't feel like I'm like trying to scam anyone
00:26:37 I feel like it's a mutually bad, but nobody nobody bit nobody bit
00:26:42 Nobody wants free money
00:26:44 Maybe they assumed that to do it they'd have to start shurning as well
00:26:49 You can just you can just turn one card
00:26:52 Churning is when you get is you get one is you get one card after another after another and you get all the sign-up bonuses
00:26:58 Churning one card is just getting a card
00:27:02 I don't know I feel like I can't be the only one
00:27:05 Who made it into their 30s without ever
00:27:09 reaping the benefits
00:27:11 of uh of of credit
00:27:13 And I feel like there's definitely people who probably should
00:27:16 have it
00:27:18 Uh, but that it's okay. They're shy. It's okay. They're a little gun shy. That's okay. You know what?
00:27:24 You know what listener
00:27:26 The girl listening right now. That's okay. Take take your time. You know come come to me when you're ready
00:27:32 Uh, oh you can you can ease you into it. No no pressure. No pressure
00:27:36 um
00:27:39 I assume it's like american only I couldn't
00:27:43 Uh, I I think so probably I'm gonna say probably
00:27:47 I don't know
00:27:49 Michelle asked me
00:27:51 For a recommendation. I gave I gave her
00:27:54 A link she has not used it yet. Just like I just once again once again
00:28:00 Michelle walks right up to the brink of wisdom
00:28:04 And then just and then spurns it and turns away at the last minute
00:28:07 Just like when I gave her a copy of a conquest of red
00:28:11 Two christmases ago
00:28:13 And she never read it
00:28:15 Spit in my fucking eye. Why don't you?
00:28:18 Uh, and now I give her I give her this referral bonus for the capital one saver one
00:28:22 A beautiful card
00:28:25 She's and she says I'll get around to she asked me
00:28:28 Motherfucker she came to me and asked me for for it
00:28:32 And she didn't even do it
00:28:35 No respect no respect. I tell you
00:28:38 Um, you know of all that I think that PayPal credit has no benefit at all that I was talking about earlier
00:28:45 Yeah, I looked it up and I believe that it does not like
00:28:49 Report to like credit bureaus. I I don't think you can like build a credit history with PayPal credit doesn't seem to be any
00:28:55 Sort of number associated
00:28:56 It's just like if you need to pay for something you don't have all the funds in your account right now
00:29:02 Yeah, you can do it. Yeah. It's okay. Well, whatever
00:29:05 Which is which is like the most the most basic function of a credit card is that it does that
00:29:11 But also credit cards have other benefits aside from that which PayPal does not
00:29:17 Yes, I should get something
00:29:19 I I need to I I was looking at like
00:29:22 like
00:29:23 British
00:29:24 YouTubers, uh with their British, uh, you know credit card information and I'm like, okay, but you're wow
00:29:31 You're so boring and I don't I just want it to be for dummies. Please. I put on I put on um
00:29:38 I put on some like finance credit guy some youtuber the other day
00:29:43 I didn't watch him for a long time
00:29:45 But I watched like one or two of his video and I was a bit disappointed because he didn't really tell me anything that I
00:29:49 Didn't already know so I was like, okay. I think I get the picture
00:29:53 um
00:29:54 But I was curious like if it's like if I
00:29:58 If there is anything else that I could be knowing right now that would be I did learn actually that the
00:30:03 This is not helpful information, but I did learn that there are certain cards that you cannot sign up for that like
00:30:10 If you if you have like a million dollars in in in a bank the bank will contact you and be like
00:30:15 Hey, do you want to sign up for our like super ultra fucking premium?
00:30:19 like
00:30:20 gold star platinum card
00:30:23 And then you say yes, and then it gives you better benefits than any card you can just get as like a normal human rich get richer
00:30:30 I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, basically
00:30:33 um
00:30:35 We'll give you a free horse every year
00:30:38 The guy the guy said that guy it was oh actually there was an interesting thing. He said he said like
00:30:44 For many cards like for a bunch of the cards that I have like you need a good score
00:30:48 You need a good credit score, but you don't need to have like an amazing credit score
00:30:52 There's no there's no card that like demands that you have like an 850 plus
00:30:57 You know credit score like most cards that are choosy
00:31:01 Like they just want you to be above like
00:31:03 Six something right maybe 700. Yeah, they're not they just they want a pretty good score, but there's none that are like
00:31:10 The really exclusive ones do not exclude based on like do you have perfect credit score?
00:31:15 They exclude based on like how much money do you have like are you rich basically?
00:31:21 I mean the point of a credit
00:31:23 Is in theory like to just make sure that the person
00:31:27 You're buying something from or whatever selling something to you. Um has some understanding that you can
00:31:34 Get the money to them
00:31:36 Yeah
00:31:37 Basically, and if you if you're if you're at all capable then most people will be like, okay, you're a normal person. Yes
00:31:44 Did you see that guy on twitter some fucking nft loser made a whole thread about how like
00:31:51 Job hiring could be done on the blockchain
00:31:56 Yeah, I have no idea what he meant
00:31:59 He just it assumes that like the blockchain would allow people to get hired instantly somehow
00:32:04 It's a it's a half-baked idea. The idea is that like the blockchain is a permanent
00:32:11 record of transactions
00:32:12 therefore your entire like life history and financial history should be recorded on the blockchain therefore like
00:32:20 interviews would be unnecessary and like the
00:32:23 Like the hiring company could just check the blockchain instantly know whether you were hireable or not
00:32:29 And I mean his idea is that it like saves on like time and energy and effort
00:32:34 but like
00:32:35 You know at the at the cost of there being an indelible record of a person's life that may or that you know
00:32:42 May or may not be accurate and can never be changed ever
00:32:46 Yeah, so you know
00:32:48 It's they didn't quite grasp the idea that like
00:32:54 That would be very bad for certain people
00:32:58 Someone was like
00:32:59 You know, you know that meme of like the soy face is like angry at the one thing
00:33:03 But then like make it he's soy soy facing at the other thing. That's the same but slightly different. Oh, yeah
00:33:08 Yeah, I saw that one that was like
00:33:10 Social credit system. Mmm social credit system on the blockchain. Wow
00:33:16 Yeah, literally. Yeah, literally literally
00:33:20 Just put it on the blockchain. I like that's the answer to everything
00:33:23 I like uh social credit because I assume I would be at the top of the food chain in that one. Hmm. Yeah
00:33:30 I said there's no way it could go wrong for me
00:33:32 If we did have a dystopian social credit on the blockchain system
00:33:36 I would simply I would simply have a clean record and and and not have any problems with it
00:33:43 I would simply not uh, I would simply not encounter any difficulties. Yeah
00:33:52 Six society six society
00:33:55 uh
00:33:56 We're talking about fuck. I've completely lost track
00:34:00 Uh, you wanted to complain about not oh, yeah, nobody wants my free money. I'm I'm out here
00:34:05 I'm I'm trying I'm literally peddling free money
00:34:09 Some people probably couldn't take me up on the offer. Some people probably don't have credit scores that are good enough
00:34:13 uh, which is a shame, but uh
00:34:16 If you've got if you you listening if you've got like a decent credit score
00:34:21 And you don't have a credit card, but you've been considering
00:34:25 Getting one and you want my recommendation
00:34:28 And you want to give one of my referral links to try I can I can uh, I can hit me up in the dms
00:34:32 I can I can help us both out
00:34:35 I'm winking I'm winking into the microphone if you can hear that if you can hear my eyelids my eye my eyelash is brushing against the
00:34:43 Against the microphone
00:34:45 um
00:34:47 Buh, I know it's pretty it's pretty gauche. It's pretty gauche
00:34:53 It's pretty gauche to be peddling like credit card referral links on your podcast and on your twitter
00:34:57 But you know what but you know what I just don't care anymore
00:35:01 It's no more it's no more gauche than being at least I'm not an nft bro, right? Sure. I might
00:35:07 That's what I'll do
00:35:09 I'll be like at least I'll be like committing
00:35:11 I'll be like committing committing high treason committing mass murder at least I'm not an nft bro, right?
00:35:18 um
00:35:21 accidentally accidentally like uh
00:35:24 Accidentally like drop my phone in the toilet before I shit and like accidentally upload a video of me
00:35:29 Of my asshole just shitting into the toilet
00:35:32 And I look at my I look at my timeline blowing up as people go lull cringe and I go at least I'm not an nft bro
00:35:40 At least I don't have a lazy line for my pfp
00:35:47 People saying lull cringe to like a scat video accidentally uploaded by ben sing
00:35:54 It goes viral it makes the rounds it ends up
00:35:56 They talk about it on lull cringe. Oh, no, they would just say lull. They feel lull. Great. Can you believe this guy?
00:36:03 What a nerd
00:36:07 That's what that's what I would do and that's what a dork
00:36:10 What a dork, uh, what a look I can you look at let's look at this guy
00:36:16 pause as they consider
00:36:18 The asshole the feces emerging from the asshole
00:36:22 Dang man. I boy would my face be right?
00:36:28 Fucking reaction video circuit
00:36:32 People couldn't yeah keem star keem star comments on on on asshole gait
00:36:44 Like I said, I've been
00:36:46 Think of like the situation that would lead to that like your your live streaming on your phone
00:36:51 And then you say hang on i'm gonna go take a shit
00:36:53 You drop your phone that you know your live streaming you drop your phone in the toilet
00:36:58 And continue to shit anyway forget don't notice that I drop my and just keep shitting onto the the phone camera
00:37:04 Which continues to operate while it's in the toilet bowl underwater
00:37:08 You know it could happen
00:37:11 Oh, yeah, totally. Why not? Why not?
00:37:15 Uh
00:37:17 I
00:37:18 Right I was gonna say sorry
00:37:21 I'm I'm I've lost a little bit of weight in the last couple weeks. I went to the doctor the other day. I had a I had a check up
00:37:28 Uh, uh, they didn't do anything
00:37:31 I thought they were gonna like have to like test my blood or something test my cholesterol now
00:37:34 They didn't do it. They were like now you're not old enough for that. I was like, okay
00:37:38 Uh, uh, they gave me uh
00:37:40 the
00:37:41 Oh, they weighed me right and I have lost I have lost a few pounds in the last couple weeks. I've lost like 10 pounds
00:37:47 Uh, which is pretty good. That's a decent rate. Uh, considering when I started
00:37:52 Uh, uh, working out again and stuff. I was hoping to be down to like 175 by Christmas
00:37:58 I don't know if I'm gonna hit that goal, but uh, I'm I probably won't be too far off
00:38:03 Christmas is the season to be getting fat again
00:38:06 Uh
00:38:09 What happens?
00:38:10 Yeah, but like whatever
00:38:12 at the end of the day
00:38:14 It doesn't matter. It doesn't really matter
00:38:18 Uh
00:38:19 If I if I eat a bunch of Christmas gain a few pounds
00:38:23 Whatever, it'll be it'll be less than I've lost on the way there
00:38:26 It's insulation from the cold
00:38:28 It'll all just it'll all just go to my gains anyway, you know as long as I'm lifting as long as I'm lifting
00:38:32 It doesn't matter that much because even if I overeat one day or another like it just goes to your gains
00:38:38 It just goes to fuel your muscle growth and turn you into a a metabolic furnace
00:38:44 Uh, uh
00:38:46 I've been I've been my deadlift has been skyrocketing but yesterday. I think I hit
00:38:51 I think I've hitting a wall with it. I think I finally
00:38:54 Experienced I like oh this deadlift doesn't feel that good. Oh, my form is not great. Oh, I probably shouldn't have done
00:39:00 That I probably should not have attempted to complete that
00:39:04 Uh, it was 285 285 is the wall
00:39:07 Uh, I will I will maybe have to uh a slow down on it. I've been going up 10 pounds per per like
00:39:15 lift like every time I deadlift, but I've
00:39:18 I have to slow down
00:39:20 I had I was hoping I would hit 300 but I'm not quite there and I'm in my forms my form is breaking down
00:39:26 So I gotta
00:39:27 I gotta cool it. I gotta cool it. Um
00:39:32 Talking about how much I lift is probably about as interesting as talking about what bitcoin is worth right now
00:39:38 Yeah
00:39:41 To react to it like oh cool nice cool nice number, bro
00:39:45 Yeah, um
00:39:47 Newton
00:39:49 Newtons
00:39:51 force
00:39:53 Pound mass times mass times acceleration of gravity
00:39:58 divided by
00:40:01 Something area no
00:40:03 Uh, you just gotta go to jupiter and then lift a small amount and then it'll be a lot easier to gain
00:40:12 Because the gravity that's this DBZ method. Yeah
00:40:16 You gotta go to well you gotta go to the moon and then you can lift six times as much and you go
00:40:20 Oh, I deadlifted I deadlifted 1800 pounds on the moon
00:40:24 Wait, no, it wouldn't be pounds because pounds is a measure of force
00:40:28 Pounds is weight. It's not mass
00:40:30 but so you could say I deadlifted, you know, like
00:40:34 2000 kilograms on the moon and then that's out of the sound that would be accurate and sound like a lot
00:40:40 So uh, but then if you stayed on the moon for too long you've become like
00:40:46 Jelly your your your muscles will get too used to
00:40:50 And lifting yourself, which is which way is less
00:40:54 I bet your bones would become brittler and you'd you'd elongate
00:40:58 I bet did did the astronauts
00:41:01 Did the astronauts do like resistance training?
00:41:04 In space they must right
00:41:06 Uh, I've heard I've heard the space stations. Yeah, they do something to keep them. They must they must do some kind of exercise
00:41:12 To prevent like muscle atrophy from like the low gravity, right? Because I've yeah, I have heard that like
00:41:17 If you're in space your muscles like atrophy because like
00:41:20 You don't use them
00:41:22 So they must do some kind of resistance training. They do like like Naruto fights
00:41:27 with each other
00:41:29 I mean, I mean, yeah
00:41:31 I mean, yeah, but that's that's cardio. That's cardio. It doesn't count
00:41:38 They try to do like the samus morph ball. They're all just nerds up there
00:41:41 They do the samus morph ball
00:41:44 Wait, why why do they do the samus morph ball? Well, it's it's really really stretches your back muscles
00:41:52 I mean, which is uh, actually it's a way to do something. Okay, you know how you know like
00:41:59 You know how when you like spin something
00:42:02 Maybe you spin something that's like long
00:42:05 But then you like contract it and it spins faster. Do you know what i'm talking about?
00:42:09 Uh centrifugal
00:42:12 Something I vaguely understand. Yes, like yeah, it's it's it's concentration of angular momentum. It's like if it's like if you um
00:42:21 Oh, oh like that playground thing the thing on the playground where it's like a wheel
00:42:25 But it's like a flat like wheel on the and there's there's handlebars to hold
00:42:29 And you run around it and you get it spinning and then you jump
00:42:33 On to it and then you move to the middle of it and it moves like much faster
00:42:37 No, it moves much slower in the middle
00:42:42 No, that's not true
00:42:43 If you if you get on it if you get it if you get it spinning while you're standing at the outside of it
00:42:49 And then you move to the middle of it. It'll spin faster
00:42:52 Oh, if you move it'll spin. Yeah
00:42:55 Yeah, if you if you if you if you move if it's spinning and you're standing if you're on it on the outside
00:43:01 And then you move to the middle of it
00:43:04 You'll move it'll spin faster
00:43:06 Yes, because if you're trying if you're trying to grab and walk towards the middle it'll feel
00:43:12 You'll slip off if you don't increase the the strength by which you grip the handlebars because it'll speed up as you're doing that
00:43:19 There's there's also okay
00:43:21 There's the things you can like they're a little thing that sits on the ground
00:43:25 And it's like a little like disc that you sit on and then there's a little like handle of a wheel that you hold
00:43:29 and you twist kind of like the thing at the middle of like the teacups ride at like disney world
00:43:34 and
00:43:36 Do you know this thing?
00:43:37 It's a it's a it's a little thing that you sit on and you hold the handle and you twist it
00:43:41 And the disc that you're sitting on will spin
00:43:44 And and so you're you can make yourself spin while you're on this disc
00:43:48 And you do that with like your hands and your legs out like you spread them out
00:43:53 And then you get yourself spinning and then once you're spinning you pull your arms and your legs in
00:43:59 And then you spin like way faster
00:44:01 Do you ever you don't know what i'm talking about? I I do I understand now
00:44:04 Okay, I have hold on um
00:44:07 Sit is it just called the sit and spin?
00:44:10 Is that what that is? I don't know what it's called. Yes, it's called the sit and spin
00:44:14 uh
00:44:15 The one of uh
00:44:16 The shit and spin
00:44:18 uh one of uh
00:44:20 I guess I might as well post a picture in case
00:44:22 Oh my god, please fucking load. Oh wait. I don't know what this is
00:44:26 It's like a tiny baby toy
00:44:29 There is yes, it is it is a tiny baby toy
00:44:32 Um
00:44:33 Here I'll post a picture in the so if you're if you're you put a baby on that and they spin really fast
00:44:38 Aren't they just gonna be flying off and hit their head? I don't I don't well
00:44:42 No, you put your legs around the like middle thing
00:44:45 So like you're you're like in the middle of it. You're not on the edge of it
00:44:48 You sit on it um and and and I mean a baby wouldn't have the fucking hand-eye coordination to like
00:44:55 Actually make it work
00:44:56 But yeah, you sit on one of these and you spin and then you pull your arms and legs in
00:45:01 And due to conservation of angular momentum, you spin way faster while you're when when they're
00:45:07 contracted in than when they're extended out
00:45:09 Um, why the fuck did I start talking about this? What were we talking about that made me start talk?
00:45:15 Well, we were talking about people in the space station trying to maintain. Oh the morph ball
00:45:21 That's what I'm saying
00:45:21 So if you were in if you were an astronaut and you were in the space and you are floating in a in a you know a room
00:45:29 And you get
00:45:31 By some means by pushing off the walls or whatever you get yourself spinning
00:45:35 Rotating forward extended and then no no no no
00:45:39 Specifically specifically think about this you you you're rotating forward, right?
00:45:43 Like you're going like head going forward
00:45:46 and down
00:45:47 legs going backward and up right and you're and you're fully
00:45:50 And then you and then you yeah you crunch and you curl yourself into a ball, right?
00:45:55 You curl yourself into a morph ball you would suddenly start
00:45:58 You would you would start uh fucking screw attacking
00:46:01 Right, you would because your moment your angular momentum would increase so much
00:46:07 Well, it would stay constant
00:46:08 But your speed would increase to conserve angular momentum, then you would be a little fucking screw attack morph ball
00:46:14 Oh my god, samus is real
00:46:18 It really it really works it really works if you think about it
00:46:23 God I wonder if I wonder now that I'm thinking about it like I
00:46:29 I almost wonder if like they had that in mind when they came up with that idea for like the screw attack
00:46:33 It's like
00:46:34 Yeah, if she put if she pushed off if she gave herself a bit of rotation
00:46:38 And then she curled herself up in a ball her angular momentum would stay constant and she would spin really fast
00:46:45 I I I I wonder I mean
00:46:48 Potentially, I think also it's just the fact that if you're like doing trapeze jump trampoline jumps
00:46:55 Curling up in a ball makes you spin around faster and that's just sort of common knowledge
00:46:59 You see people jumping and spinning like that. I guess it's the same. It's the same principle. Yeah
00:47:06 Yeah
00:47:10 Curious
00:47:14 Fascinating fascinating uh
00:47:17 This is what my this is what my physics degree. Let's me do let's me think about uh,
00:47:22 Samus's screw attack is actually scientifically accurate. And here's my here's my 25 minute long youtube video explaining why
00:47:30 um
00:47:31 That video would probably do pretty well on youtube, right?
00:47:34 Yeah, it'll it'll be like. Oh, wow video game
00:47:39 samus screw attack physics
00:47:44 Hmm
00:47:46 It feels like the sort of subject matter that a game theory would be about like years ago
00:47:52 Yes
00:47:53 Like a classic game theory before they
00:47:56 Were almost entirely about why a scary game has lore that makes sense. I'm on
00:48:02 I'm on the wiki troid. I'm on the the metroid
00:48:05 Uh wiki on the screw attack page and I have control f'd momentum and no results
00:48:12 So apparently no one has ever thought about this before
00:48:16 We're misbusters and we're gonna see if morph ball could really work
00:48:21 Answer yes answer. Yes. It's real answer. Yes
00:48:25 No
00:48:27 No, I'm the first one
00:48:29 I'm the originator. I wonder if hang on morph ball
00:48:34 Uh cosplay has somebody done a morph ball and rolled around
00:48:42 I don't know you find anything
00:48:46 Uh, well, I can see okay. I see people walking around with a morph ball somebody getting into it
00:48:52 But not as a morph ball. I think that maybe they just have a ball with them
00:48:56 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's what I'm seeing. Uh, oh, I found uh, I found this this is good
00:49:03 Um posting that right there
00:49:06 That's a winner
00:49:09 This one this one
00:49:11 No, no, no, what what is going on here? What is going on here? Now?
00:49:16 Why would samus be with a morph ball samus should be in the morph ball?
00:49:22 That doesn't make any goddamn sense
00:49:26 Uh, it's it's it's samus's twin sister samus
00:49:30 She took it she took the suit off and hit the like auto morph ball button if you know for for store for easy storage
00:49:37 Yeah, is that is that ball just like placed into the
00:49:41 It's photos if you look in the background. There's an orb like a
00:49:45 Concrete orb in the back. So it's probably just that
00:49:49 That they photoshopped it over
00:49:52 I okay
00:49:55 Yeah, now that you mentioned it. Yeah, it is a bit weird that there's another orb in the scene
00:50:00 I feel like they didn't need to like sample the orb
00:50:03 Okay, right. I think they did it for the shadow on the ground
00:50:08 But but look there's like
00:50:10 There's like some shit in front of the orb though. They would have had to like photo edit the
00:50:15 I don't know. I feel like that's like wait what more and more effort than it's
00:50:19 Well, look the orb in the back. There's like shit on the ground. Yeah, that's because it's really there
00:50:23 It's a concrete orb in space. I'm saying that would make it really needlessly hard to like
00:50:30 Sample that orb. No, they didn't suck a bad orb. There's the orb that the morph ball is
00:50:35 There's just a separate orb
00:50:38 Oh
00:50:39 You're right that has orbs around if some reason
00:50:43 Is this okay? Is this uh, is this baltimore? Is this the baltimore convention center?
00:50:48 Um, you know those trees and that thing in the back. It looks a little it looks a lot like that fountain area
00:50:55 By the fucking brony con. I don't it could be
00:50:58 Is that an ice cold water truck?
00:51:01 Ice cold water that guy didn't have a truck. Uh, not a truck. They're like a little cart
00:51:06 Yeah
00:51:08 No, it's just a
00:51:09 somebody's pushing a pram
00:51:12 That has
00:51:13 cartoons on the side. I don't know what the hell that is like a
00:51:16 uh
00:51:18 Hold on. Hold on. I guess I got to check google maps. I gotta check google maps and see if there are orbs. I've got a geo guess for this
00:51:24 We've got a geo detective find this location
00:51:29 Have you seen any of those videos by that by the straight line mission man?
00:51:34 Oh, you uh, I've heard about them and I think you've talked about them
00:51:39 Yeah, but I haven't really has like pictures from his patreon of people
00:51:44 Uh, who have taken a picture or just sent him a picture of them in a place and he uses like geo guess our knowledge
00:51:52 And google maps to triangulate and like find exactly where they are as a challenge
00:52:00 So like if you take any given picture you could probably do it if you have
00:52:04 Then the the wits to like notice. Ah, this is probably this kind of a country or that kind of a
00:52:13 Something or other
00:52:15 Hey, what was the name of the place that the that the that brony con was at?
00:52:19 It wasn't was it just called the baltimore convention center? I think so
00:52:24 Well, like i'm i'm i'm google mapping baltimore convention center and it doesn't look like it. It doesn't look like the same place
00:52:31 Uh
00:52:33 Was that the gay lord hotel nearby?
00:52:37 Like connected to it was there
00:52:39 well, there was um
00:52:42 Well, there was uh
00:52:45 The the horse there was the horseshoe in right
00:52:48 That was a little not. Yeah, that was somewhere. I don't know where it was in relation to the convention center
00:52:57 Hmm
00:53:00 Well, we we would pass it on the drive
00:53:05 Brony con baltimore
00:53:09 Location this is not interesting. I just i'm just
00:53:12 Ball yeah, the baltimore convention
00:53:14 It doesn't look like
00:53:16 I must be looking at like the wrong side of the building or something because like this doesn't look
00:53:22 Like I remember it maybe i'm thinking of like the harbor area
00:53:27 Maybe i'm thinking of like maybe i'm thinking of like when we're hanging out or like around the port
00:53:32 Ah, whatever
00:53:33 I'm i'm just gonna google brony con. I just i i just want to see
00:53:38 The fucking the fountain area. Okay. Okay. This is the
00:53:43 Oh, this is the area. I'm looking at the this area of the map right here and this is where okay
00:53:49 Yeah, this is where um
00:53:51 I sampled this image
00:53:53 for
00:53:54 the scene
00:53:56 of slime and punishment
00:53:59 Uh in which they activate
00:54:01 The device the the trans dimensional
00:54:05 timeline
00:54:07 Device uh for the for the pseudo finale s revert
00:54:11 This is the this is the the scene that I that I photo bashed into that
00:54:17 That that hole that hole kerfuffle
00:54:20 Uh, I literally just want to find
00:54:23 the fountains
00:54:25 and see
00:54:27 The orbs
00:54:28 I just want to see if there's orbs there. I'm going to scream
00:54:31 I'm going to fucking scream
00:54:33 Because google is just not is just like it's simply not it's simply not
00:54:38 Just just show me the just function just function as intended
00:54:42 I do this all the time and now when I need to do it now when I am trying to do it on it in the timely fashion
00:54:48 It's totally impossible
00:54:50 uh
00:54:54 Okay, whatever I don't care about this. I don't care anymore
00:54:57 Uh, unless you do in which case I also I'm I'm still looking wait, so the
00:55:02 I'm at the bolt more conventions center
00:55:06 On google maps
00:55:08 I see you remember you remember the fountain area the found the fountain area
00:55:12 I don't really remember the fountain area. Is it was it near the front?
00:55:17 Or was it just yeah, we hung out. Yeah
00:55:20 It was like it was out front and to the right of the
00:55:24 Of the of the main convention area. There was the like funny little like
00:55:29 There was the funny little like cave tunnel you could sort of walk under that had like little waterfalls inside
00:55:37 Oh the cave tunnel I do remember that
00:55:40 What was that? That was like sort of down the road a bit
00:55:44 A little bit
00:55:46 I don't know which direction this would be in
00:55:49 Hilton. Oh, yeah, there's the hilton that it was connected to
00:55:54 With the walkway
00:55:58 Sheraton inner harbor
00:56:01 You okay, you couldn't you couldn't see the harbor
00:56:05 And there's the harbor. Yes
00:56:09 Well, yeah, I mean it was it was near the harbor. It wasn't it wasn't on the harbor. Um
00:56:16 I'm trying to remember I'm remembering like the time when it was like dark after the convention
00:56:21 Okay, I'm switching rck people sitting on the the harbor
00:56:25 I'm switching to photo. I'm switching to photo view instead of map view. All right. I'm looking around
00:56:33 The the convention center
00:56:37 And I
00:56:38 Okay, there's a
00:56:40 I guess there's a baseball dime and like right near it. I don't even remember that
00:56:43 Okay, I remember the bubblegum shrimp company. We would walk by that all the time
00:56:48 Oh, and uh, and then
00:56:52 Oh, oh the kona grill
00:56:56 Okay, we would walk past the kona grill
00:57:00 So it must have been down in the easterly direction. Oh, there it is. Uh, yes
00:57:05 yes
00:57:07 It's a mckelden square and mckelden plaza
00:57:13 I believe this is the the
00:57:15 Region I'm looking for
00:57:18 Okay, now we got it now we got to find these orbs
00:57:32 Hmm
00:57:36 Hmm
00:57:39 On my back
00:57:41 Yeah, did you leave I disconnected uh for a second
00:57:47 Okay, what am I looking at
00:57:51 This is
00:57:54 All right
00:57:55 Yeah, there's the pnc bank. Yeah, this is familiar. I remember this street
00:58:00 but then
00:58:03 Like there's supposed to be
00:58:08 I feel like I'm looking at
00:58:11 The exact place
00:58:13 But there's no fountain
00:58:16 How old is this uh, uh, mckechted november 2020 so yeah, it's not
00:58:23 Probably not yeah, I can't be that old
00:58:31 Well like hold on like
00:58:34 I'm gonna show you this this street view
00:58:37 And tell me I mean tell me if you're having the same sensation as me
00:58:43 I feel like this is the corner
00:58:46 where it was
00:58:49 And and and there was a fountain
00:58:52 Like maybe that like concrete thing over on the left
00:58:57 Was part of it. Was it like in from the from the
00:59:02 Wait a minute
00:59:03 Wait a minute
00:59:05 I remember you it was like there was a wall of water and you went down steps to see it
00:59:13 Maybe it's hiding. Yeah
00:59:17 I'm losing my fucking mind
00:59:21 I'm losing my fucking mind over here
00:59:25 Uh
00:59:27 Was it past like we got to go back to brony con to find out looks like we got to go back one here we go again
00:59:34 The real last brony con this time. Um, all right, I'm going insane
00:59:40 I feel like I found it and it wasn't there. This is like some this is like some mandala effect
00:59:46 I swear there was like a cave and a waterfall
00:59:49 And like a a magical fairy gave me a magic sword while I was down there. It wasn't just a dream mom
00:59:58 Um, okay. Well, that was stupid
01:00:01 Um, if you could find it
01:00:05 Give us a yeah, like give us a comment about that comment in the description saying like
01:00:10 Where is this fucking fountain? Where is this looking in the wrong direction? Where are these fucking orbs?
01:00:16 Where are the orbs? Where are they find the orbs?
01:00:19 Find the we're on orb hunt
01:00:21 We're on this is this is an orb hunt if you can find the orb
01:00:25 Send us a voicemail and uh, we will voice grail you telling us you didn't don't tell us unless
01:00:32 Unless multiple people do it and then we won't voicemail voice grail you all that would be stupid. Um
01:00:40 Okay
01:00:42 Okay, I found
01:00:44 I just found something there is some okay. There is something in mckelden square
01:00:49 That is called mckelden fountain
01:00:52 uh, but it's like
01:00:54 Street view is like, you know, it's like too far out
01:00:57 From the the square that like it's hard for me to actually see it from the street
01:01:02 So like that's gotta be it. That's gotta be the thing we're thinking of
01:01:06 It's just you just can't see it with street view because like they didn't take pictures inside of the square
01:01:12 Or wait, no did they?
01:01:15 There are some
01:01:18 It like
01:01:20 It looks like there are spots it seems to suggest to me that there are spots inside of the square
01:01:26 that you can
01:01:28 That you can drop your little man your little street view man into
01:01:33 Oh, wow, they took like a drone shot
01:01:36 What the fuck
01:01:38 Wow, I wish uh, I wish I had had this drone shot
01:01:42 For slime and punishment this look look at this
01:01:45 This looks great
01:01:48 I would have used the shit out of this
01:01:51 It's surely it's surely the thing we're talking about. You just can't see it at all in this fucking uh
01:01:59 In this app, but oh, oh well, I mean I feel like mystery sol
01:02:04 No orbs though
01:02:07 The question of the the question of the orbs remains unanswered
01:02:11 um, okay, so um
01:02:15 What else what else what else?
01:02:17 Uh, well, I've been working on oh, yeah go on
01:02:21 Yeah, I mean, I haven't really got much to talk about
01:02:25 because this past week I have
01:02:28 Oh, excuse me
01:02:30 I have been working
01:02:32 uh tirelessly
01:02:34 and I say I but like I
01:02:37 There's a secret project that I talked about
01:02:40 A while ago, and I've been working on it
01:02:43 And it is going well and if you want to know I know what it is
01:02:47 Ben knows what it is if you want to know more about it
01:02:49 I do reveal what I what I'm talking about in my latest money spenders podcast
01:02:54 Over on give and take a patreon.com slash give and take well now. I don't feel special for knowing anymore
01:03:00 No, that's okay because I am a money spenders
01:03:03 You are a money spender. Yeah, I am a money spender
01:03:07 Um, I haven't listened in a couple in a while. I should go catch up
01:03:12 Yeah, they're all the secrets. So all the things I I want this one. I will this one. I definitely want to listen to
01:03:19 uh, so yes
01:03:21 It's it's unfortunate for pcp because I don't have anything to talk about yet because I want to keep a little under wraps
01:03:27 Until I'm ready to be like hey everybody. This is what I've been doing this whole time
01:03:33 I was uh
01:03:36 My project is not a secret. It's uh phantom's revenge
01:03:38 But I was I was working on it yesterday and I was posting in my
01:03:42 In my patron discord server my server is public
01:03:45 But my my patron channel is private for patrons only and I share
01:03:48 updates on on what I'm working on for the game in that channel
01:03:53 and I was
01:03:54 posting some uh this week. I've been working on uh
01:03:58 Room like background art like like the final the final version of like every room in the game because you go through a series of rooms and like
01:04:04 They're each different. Um
01:04:07 And I've been making the background art and I took a break from that to draw some
01:04:11 character portraits for like the talk sprites that I'm going to need for the final
01:04:15 cutscene
01:04:16 and I
01:04:17 drew them
01:04:19 And they were so good. I loved them so much that I had to I went and I posted in the patron secret project discord
01:04:25 I said hey guys
01:04:26 I want you all to know that I drew some portraits today, but I can't show you because they're too good
01:04:32 And uh, I have to I have to save them
01:04:34 I don't want to rob you of the experience of seeing them in their in their correct
01:04:39 Context for the first time. So I won't be showing you get fucked. Uh, you're welcome
01:04:44 Uh, that was just yesterday. Uh, it was very exciting
01:04:50 Yeah, I'll have to go check out that uh, I mean, I already know what the project is
01:04:53 But I do want to hear you talk more about it
01:04:56 In the in the money spenders, uh, so
01:04:59 I could listen to that
01:05:01 Because I know I don't I don't know that much about it. You've shown me a little bit of it
01:05:06 Yeah, I I don't know if I go into like a lot of depth
01:05:10 With regards to the process or what I'm currently like exactly working on
01:05:15 It's more of like an announcement and like a
01:05:18 vague plan of action for that release
01:05:22 Okay
01:05:23 Okay, I should go into it. I mean I do want to know another at some at some point I do
01:05:27 Yeah
01:05:29 Yeah, I kind of want to know. Yeah, like what I want to know about like
01:05:35 The the the the without without revealing anything. I say, yeah, the the details the nitty gritty of it
01:05:42 Because I don't understand
01:05:44 I mean I kind of do but I I don't
01:05:47 I don't know. I don't know. I'm curious
01:05:49 Um
01:05:51 Yeah, pretty good pretty cool. Um
01:05:57 Does that like
01:05:58 Didn't you say that it's getting kind of close to being done?
01:06:02 Yes, I started it this year
01:06:05 And I wanted it to be over finished by the end of the year
01:06:09 So I'm really you know working hard to make it a reality
01:06:16 Then I will announce it and it'll be it'll be uh
01:06:20 Good, I don't know how to to like not spoil
01:06:24 Yeah, yeah, but also mention things about it in a vague fashion that would make people interested to go to money
01:06:31 To patreon.com slash give and take
01:06:34 To find out
01:06:36 That is the goal. That is the goal
01:06:40 Speaking of
01:06:42 Patreon I want to I want to our our our patreon the pc patreon has continued to increase
01:06:49 Uh since the uh since the uh the the the latest drama bomb
01:06:54 Uh that was uh
01:06:58 It what do you mean you guess
01:07:00 Well, it's like drama bucks
01:07:02 Are they really gonna stay for really anytime at all? I don't know
01:07:07 But can I actually oh but oh drama bucks
01:07:09 Can I actually pay for things with them though?
01:07:12 Like won't they turn me away at the store and say no you can't pay for no
01:07:15 Oh this is drama money. Oh, it doesn't matter. Ew. I mean I mean like the staying power of it
01:07:20 It's probably not very it's probably gonna dip back down unless there's more drama
01:07:24 But I don't I don't want to do more drama if I can
01:07:27 Well, it might it might a bit it might a bit. I don't mean we'll see. Um, it's nice to see you go up. That's for sure
01:07:35 Um
01:07:36 You know there was actually a bit this isn't like full-on drama
01:07:39 But there was people people were telling me after um the last one that in the the follow-up episode of um
01:07:47 Who are these podcasts? There were there were
01:07:51 You know they they read out a bunch of like comments from the subreddit all of many of which were very like
01:07:56 Trixie sucks don't have her back on
01:07:58 And they got one voicemail
01:08:00 About it and I thought that maybe I could play
01:08:03 There that voicemail that they received
01:08:06 Just in its entirety. What do you what do you think? Do you want to hear it?
01:08:09 I have heard it, but yeah, oh you listen to it
01:08:13 I think it was something like
01:08:15 The one I think you're talking about is the guy who says
01:08:19 If you have Trixie back on the the who are these podcasts
01:08:23 um
01:08:24 Then I'll un
01:08:26 Patron who are these podcasts and patron the guys she hated. She's making fun of us. Yes
01:08:32 He does say that here. I'll I'm just I'm just gonna post it. It's only like a minute long
01:08:38 I'm doing it. Uh
01:08:40 Here we go
01:08:41 Is it a minute? It might be like a minute and a half
01:08:45 It is yeah, it's a minute and a half. Okay. Here we go three two one go
01:08:51 Uh, all right last uh voicemail
01:08:54 When my former co-host didn't need to retweet me tweets from me
01:09:01 When these same people that unpaid me are
01:09:06 Okay, sorry, that that is true, but did you let that's the funniest part?
01:09:11 Which is that those people just one guy that was giving him one dollar a month and he was gonna unplug anyway
01:09:17 So he took his former co-host co-host Ben St. up in his office
01:09:22 So Ben paid him two dollars to unplug one dollar a month on patreon
01:09:27 Like if you're that if you're gonna like screw out that hard or one dollar a month
01:09:31 if
01:09:32 Make these make something give people something that they'll want to pay one dollar a month for like I I
01:09:38 I pledged five five a month to
01:09:41 Patreon because most episodes are great if the ladies from the vanished or a southern john or some someone who just
01:09:47 Wanted to give me six dollars to stop giving carl five good bucks a month. I say no because
01:09:54 You've given me something worthwhile. I'd rather give them six to five bucks for what I get and then then get six bucks and stop
01:10:01 Handing to all right. I think we get the point. Yeah
01:10:05 Took a while to get there, but very good point
01:10:07 When trixie brought that up they were gonna pay people who are subscribed to their show to unsubscribes like people won't do that
01:10:14 They enjoy subscribing to that right they enjoy the content
01:10:17 I'll give you 20 bucks to stop getting net flex like well. No, I'm in the middle of squid games. So what are you talking about?
01:10:21 Yeah, I'm enjoying. Okay. That was different from the one I had heard. That's pretty oh
01:10:27 Oh, okay. I weird. I thought it was the same one, but I guess there was another one that uh
01:10:34 That I that I missed uh, this is the one the the the
01:10:38 There's not there's nothing. I don't know. There's there's something that particularly rankles me. There's a certain
01:10:43 There's a certain kind
01:10:45 Of of a of a of gig head or trixie defender or just or just loser in general on the internet who will
01:10:52 Who will get really offended?
01:10:55 get really offended
01:10:57 About the uh, the like pay pay someone to un
01:11:00 Unpledged thing like it's like it's crossing some kind of boundary
01:11:05 Like it's like it's like oh you can say what you want, but you can never you should never affect
01:11:10 Someone's money in any way if you should never like do anything that affects
01:11:15 A person like materially
01:11:17 That's like too fucking far and it's uh, it's very cringe. It's very stupid
01:11:23 You'd have to be a complete moron to think that like it's it's it's like it's like oh if if someone
01:11:29 If someone is getting money
01:11:31 They always deserve it, right? They they they they they they must they must deserve it
01:11:36 No matter what and if you and if you say hey this person doesn't deserve
01:11:41 Literal literal it's literally the same it's literally the same as if like a guy is like running a scam
01:11:47 The guy is just is just scamming people and you go hey
01:11:51 don't
01:11:52 Support don't pay this guy this guy is a scammer and someone goes um you can't that's his income
01:11:58 That's his livelihood. You can't how could you how could you do that to him?
01:12:02 Because it's literally the same because Trixie like promises a product
01:12:06 She promises that the the patreon that she runs supports her anime content. It doesn't it all goes to weed
01:12:11 She spends it all on weed. She doesn't need the patreon income
01:12:14 Anyway, because she just like lives for free in in her well now in her in her boyfriend's house
01:12:19 But whatever she's just a moochie. She doesn't need the money for anything
01:12:22 The money just goes to weed which makes her content even worse actually just makes her worse at what she's supposed to be doing
01:12:27 So there's literally no reason to support her and I have ever and I would never ever feel bad
01:12:32 Uh for this uh, even if it worked even if my my scheme to pay people to unpatron worked
01:12:39 Uh, which it didn't you know, it was one dollar
01:12:41 But even if it worked I would do it and I wouldn't feel bad if I could drop $1,000 right now
01:12:46 Just to make her patreon go to zero
01:12:48 I would do it just out of spite and I would feel good about it
01:12:52 I would think it was the morally right thing to do and I would be correct in that
01:12:55 uh
01:12:56 Yeah, it's because like
01:12:59 In in the hypothetically if people are willing to not pledge to Trixie anymore. It's because
01:13:06 They understand that it's because they don't value because they don't value the thing that they're supposedly pledging for enough
01:13:12 It's not like you're paying them
01:13:15 And that's somehow coercing them to do something. They didn't know how to do anyway. Like there's it's the free market
01:13:21 It's the free fucking market, baby libertarian for life
01:13:26 Uh, yeah
01:13:29 Yeah, it's cry. It's it's crybaby bullshit. It's crybaby bullshit to cry about it and say like, oh, you're not that's too far
01:13:36 It's you're not allowed to do it. I think it's even crybaby or bullshit to say it about someone else
01:13:41 Yeah, I think people are just scared of you ben. You're just too dangerous. You're too powerful
01:13:46 In their eyes, I am too there was that one moron on twitter the other day
01:13:51 that one moron on twitter was like
01:13:53 Yeah, they were they were like um
01:13:56 They were like it makes me scared. It makes me scared that ben's allowed to do this
01:14:02 Good
01:14:03 Good, it's like, yeah, it was what this is cancel culture ben. You're canceling someone. What if what if someone wants to cancel me?
01:14:10 It's like, well
01:14:11 Then you'll be fucking kid then the market will cancel you. I'm sorry. This is the
01:14:15 The invisible the invisible hand will will smite you
01:14:18 um
01:14:20 I am the invisible hand of the free market
01:14:23 and um
01:14:25 um
01:14:26 Uh, wait that guy that guy said something else that guy said um, oh really funny that guy said like
01:14:33 It he made a bunch of like reply tweets me and one of them he was like
01:14:37 I just don't think ben is actually doing this out of like genuine concern for tricksy. I think ben's doing this just out of spite
01:14:44 No fucking shit my dude. No way. You are you are you are you are you serious?
01:14:52 Are you really what would the difference be?
01:14:59 And then final note about that guy because I really fucking hate that guy that guy's a huge loser. Um, uh, uh
01:15:06 The final thing that guy finally was like
01:15:09 Was like block the guy finally he made one final tweet was like well, I'm gonna okay ben
01:15:14 Well, guess what? I'm gonna go patron tricksy now just to spite you block and then he blocked me
01:15:20 Uh, and then I checked a little later to see if tricksy's patreon had gone up by one person
01:15:25 Uh, it didn't the guy's a fucking liar. I hope you're listening right now. You fucking loser
01:15:29 Eat shit. What a fucking bitch. What a pussy do it pussy
01:15:33 He won't
01:15:35 I'm really mad about that guy. Can you tell yes?
01:15:38 That guy ruined my fucking day. He was I saw him and he was
01:15:43 It was very much like
01:15:45 I don't know
01:15:46 I I thought it was like status quo like there's a status quo in the tricksy is getting mad. You're trying to change that
01:15:53 Yeah, true
01:15:54 You're trying to change the status quo dude. You're trying to affect something in the real world and that's frankly that offends me
01:16:00 um
01:16:01 Wait, I was gonna say something um
01:16:04 Oh, yeah, I thought I thought I had burned away like every person who might still be following me who might like
01:16:09 Get offended on tricksy's behalf. I thought they were all gone
01:16:12 But this guy had somehow managed to escape the purge
01:16:17 And survived this long uh good good riddance I say
01:16:21 um
01:16:22 Anyway, I thought that was funny and infuriating
01:16:26 um
01:16:27 What else what else?
01:16:32 The the the the portraits
01:16:35 The port i'll say i'll say this the portraits that I was drawing for phantom's revenge that I was so happy with that I wouldn't show anyone
01:16:42 where um
01:16:44 I won't say exactly what they were of
01:16:46 but they were of someone uh uh screaming
01:16:50 and I
01:16:51 I realized as I was drawing this I was like
01:16:55 I'm I'm drawing this character
01:16:58 screaming
01:16:59 And I'm like making the face myself like I'm
01:17:02 I'm like grimacing and like and I'm going like
01:17:06 I'm like
01:17:09 Do you do that? I think a lot of people do
01:17:12 I I I I I don't know. It felt great. I loved I loved it. I loved it so much. It had such a good time just
01:17:19 Like I was like not screaming, but you know grunting like you're making rage sounds. Yeah, it's like um
01:17:26 Even when I'm like writing dialogue or something
01:17:29 Or I'm thinking about how they would say it or what their expression would be
01:17:33 I I realized that I'm doing the expression in my head. I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah
01:17:37 Like a flower head says this and he's got like, you know, I'm like, oh wait, I'm doing it. I'm doing the flower head face
01:17:44 Yeah, yeah, yeah
01:17:46 Oh, but it felt great. It was a it was exhilarating
01:17:50 I was just like what is like the angriest that I could possibly be well
01:17:54 Let me just try and conjure that
01:17:56 In my soul right now and then translate it
01:17:59 Into um into onto the the the the digital page and that's what I did and it was uh it was beautiful
01:18:07 um
01:18:09 Can't wait for fucking finish the game. I think
01:18:13 I'm really crank. I'm really cranking it out. I feel
01:18:17 I I rue every minute
01:18:20 every minute that I spent on like
01:18:24 Funny little graphical flourishes
01:18:27 I don't know. It's hard. You're some of them. I really like I sort of regret them. I feel like
01:18:33 Honestly
01:18:34 The reflections in the floor are nice and all
01:18:37 I don't feel like it was worth the time that I spent making the floor reflective. It was
01:18:43 A big the the blood effects the blood effects are good
01:18:47 The blood effects look good and I think they were a worthwhile inclusion and I spent a few days on them
01:18:51 But like I think they were worth it. The reflection in the floor
01:18:56 Was harder and it continues to it continues to be a thing that eats up development time
01:19:01 It continues to be something that like I
01:19:04 Keep finding new like ways in which it fucks up and having to fix it and it continues to be a drain on me and I
01:19:11 Find myself being like I wish I had just not
01:19:14 Added this feature. It's it's nice and all but it's really not the game would have been fine without it
01:19:19 It doesn't add enough to justify
01:19:22 All via the work that I put into it
01:19:24 Oh, oh well
01:19:26 You know, I really should have focused on just delivering
01:19:30 The minimum viable product just making the good the game
01:19:33 Just as good as it needs to be to be the complete product as envisioned. It didn't need floor reflections to be that it was
01:19:41 But it's got them
01:19:43 I mean, they look pretty slick
01:19:45 They look pretty slick. I don't really care about the game looking slick. Well, I mean, I sort of do a little bit
01:19:51 Yeah, I'm too I guess
01:19:54 I
01:19:56 Just wish it was I just wanted to be done
01:19:58 I feel I feel like getting it done should have been should be the priority
01:20:03 and I feel like
01:20:04 adding something like that is counter to the
01:20:08 The real goal, which is just yeah, you gotta be careful about finished. Yeah feature creep. Yeah
01:20:14 That was a do you have like a list of like things that need to functionally work?
01:20:20 For it to be considered playable
01:20:23 Do I have that?
01:20:24 Yeah, because like if you have a list of things and you if you notice
01:20:28 You're like, oh, I could add this then you add it to the list and if the list is growing then you realize
01:20:34 You're never gonna get it done if it just keeps growing. You've got to strike things off the list
01:20:38 Yeah, I
01:20:40 Yeah, I do have a list
01:20:42 Sometimes I will sometimes I will just think of something and be like, hmm
01:20:47 What if I did that and then I will
01:20:49 Kind of you know, if it's an interesting idea and I think yeah, floor reflections was one of these things
01:20:54 I will fuck around with it a little bit
01:20:56 And then if I like the results I'm getting from the fucking around I'll be like, okay
01:21:00 Sure, I'll go with it and floor reflections was like I added a simple version of it initially and I thought yeah, that's good
01:21:07 And then I and then I kept working on other stuff and then I was like
01:21:10 Hmm
01:21:11 I think I could make the floor reflections look a little bit slicker and then I got a bit
01:21:15 I fell a bit down a rabbit hole of like making trying to make them look as slick as possible
01:21:20 and
01:21:21 I I eventually did figure out like a hey, that's pretty good. Hey, I'm pretty happy with that
01:21:26 Uh
01:21:27 And it so I did I did it in pieces. I didn't do the whole thing at once. I first I added the
01:21:32 simple version
01:21:34 Then I like went back and refined it more and then I went back and refined it more and um
01:21:40 Yeah
01:21:42 it's it's just something that like
01:21:44 I have a list
01:21:45 But if I think of something that is interesting
01:21:48 I'll divert I'll divert from the list and fuck around with something else and then if it turns out that I like it I will
01:21:54 It gets de facto added
01:21:56 To the list. I don't really I don't
01:21:59 I had a big list of things. It's like I got to add this. I got to add this
01:22:03 I don't really have any like features that I need to add anymore. I do have a
01:22:08 A spreadsheet not a spreadsheet. I have a text file that just lists like bugs that I have found
01:22:14 And like things that I need to make like I need a couple more sprites for this or that
01:22:18 I need um and then lists of like
01:22:21 You know if I do this the game crashes like if I do this like the sprite disappears
01:22:25 Like if I do this the the character the the sprite draws in the wrong place or something
01:22:30 And I I'll have to go down through that list at the end and be like make sure that like, okay. This is fixed. This is fixed
01:22:36 This is fixed. Um
01:22:38 Uh
01:22:39 Do I I have I have it open right now
01:22:42 um
01:22:44 Yeah, but all the features are in all like the all like the things the game the features the game needs are in
01:22:48 It's just the content that needs specifically the the enemies all work
01:22:53 I think all the main enemies function as intended
01:22:56 I have one or two that I want to make a few small tweaks to change their sprites around a little bit
01:23:02 Uh, and then the lat and then I have the the the the the the boss basically is like the thing
01:23:08 That right the thing I was drawing the the the portraits for uh, the that's not really like adding features
01:23:13 That's just like I sort of have to build a I have to build a scene in the game
01:23:17 You know a cut scene basically that is like has dialogue and it has sprites moving around and it has uh some
01:23:24 Custom responses for certain commands that only happen in that in that particular
01:23:29 scenario
01:23:30 Uh, there's a lot to do there's a lot to do and I wish
01:23:35 I think if I could go back I would trade in the time that I spent on something like floor reflections just to
01:23:40 Have have more done of like the essential things that the game needs to have to be done because like like
01:23:47 Like I started mine at the end of last year
01:23:50 And I really would like to have it done by the end of this year to say like yeah, I worked on it for a year
01:23:55 I don't want it to go on more than that
01:23:58 I didn't want it to go on for a year in the first place, but it did
01:24:02 um
01:24:03 Yeah
01:24:04 I think it was december 19th that I started working on it last year
01:24:09 I think that was the game
01:24:10 How much of what you've done has been like you learning how to use the program?
01:24:16 and then doing um
01:24:19 Not
01:24:22 Not really learning how to use the program
01:24:26 The program is easy. Well, I mean like and I understood techniques and like yeah, how do I make floor reflections?
01:24:32 How do I make blood splatters like you didn't know what to do?
01:24:36 Initially, you just have an idea, right?
01:24:40 Yeah, I mean I
01:24:43 I didn't like I mean I I would
01:24:48 The the only thing that I like looked up how to do
01:24:51 Was building a like menu
01:24:53 Combat system. I looked I did look I looked up a tutorial that somebody made about how to create like an rpg
01:25:00 battle menu system and I implemented
01:25:03 I basically copied theirs
01:25:06 And then after that
01:25:08 I would look up like certain
01:25:10 Commands like, you know, you code it in this uh, uh gml language
01:25:14 And I would have to look up like what certain commands do in gml
01:25:18 But I didn't like look up guides or like research anything. I just kind of just made it up
01:25:24 As I went along
01:25:27 Yeah, what I mean is um
01:25:30 The the skill you have as a game developer
01:25:34 Is something you were working on as you were building the game
01:25:37 So like in the future if you were to make another game like this, you'd be able to make it a lot quicker, right?
01:25:44 Uh, I would say
01:25:46 Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably a lot of what I have been doing is transferable. I I think that
01:25:53 I think that if I were to do something like this again
01:25:57 I would have a better idea of like what not
01:26:01 to
01:26:02 Bother with
01:26:04 Yeah, I think it okay. I have learned
01:26:07 It has it has taught me the value of like
01:26:10 scripting by which what I mean is like
01:26:13 A lot of the like old code in the game is like
01:26:17 It's similar code on similar objects that do similar things and I think next time if I if I did another project like this
01:26:23 I would really want to emphasize in my mind like ben make sure
01:26:28 You use external scripts that like do certain functions
01:26:33 And do certain things like I did I did this for the floor reflections like I did eventually build like a
01:26:39 A a repeatable script that I could apply to different in-game objects that would give them the same
01:26:45 you know floor reflection
01:26:47 effect I so I didn't have to like
01:26:50 Custom code the like the floor reflection for each individual
01:26:54 object
01:26:55 Certain objects I do because they move in a certain way that the the regular the script can't handle
01:27:00 But like stationary objects can all all refer to the same like
01:27:04 A floor reflection
01:27:06 Algorithm
01:27:08 So I would make more use of that
01:27:11 Kind of thing and and try to consolidate things so I can just get away with making something
01:27:17 Once and then reusing it and reusing it as much as possible
01:27:20 Uh the original menu the the tutorial that I followed it had it included a bunch of like other
01:27:28 Shit that I didn't need like
01:27:30 My game does not have like it has items, but it doesn't have like magic. It doesn't have like like spells
01:27:36 So his whole his menu included like a spell system
01:27:39 So my code had my menu system. It has like a spell system in it
01:27:44 It's just like that option is just disabled and skips over and there's just a bunch of like ghost code in there
01:27:49 That doesn't do anything that it like would support a spell menu if I wanted to add one, but I don't
01:27:56 um
01:27:57 So I mean I just I wouldn't
01:27:59 I would exclude
01:28:01 Things like that. Uh, yeah, I think I just have a I have I have built up a sense of like
01:28:07 how to look at
01:28:09 code and know what it does and mostly what that does for me now is I look at my
01:28:14 I look at my code and I think
01:28:16 Like wow, this is a fucking mess like wow
01:28:18 This is like this is like this thing is like under so many like if then statements
01:28:24 This is under so many like conditional modifiers
01:28:26 It didn't need to be buried this deep
01:28:28 It could have there could have been so many fewer like branches to this like logic that I created here
01:28:34 I'm not going to go back and fix it because it works
01:28:37 But I could have made it a lot simpler if I had just had a
01:28:41 Clear idea of what it should look like when I had started
01:28:45 out
01:28:46 Uh
01:28:47 Oops
01:28:48 Oops, so it's so answer your question. Yes
01:28:52 Yeah, so to answer your question. Yes, I do think probably like if my the things I have learned
01:28:57 Would be transferable to another project on this one. So that's pretty cool
01:29:02 Yeah, although I mean there's plenty that I don't know like, you know the the the guy who made the original menu system
01:29:07 He used a lot of um
01:29:09 Like arrays
01:29:11 And I just don't
01:29:12 I like don't use arrays. I feel like probably I could
01:29:17 And it would make things certain things easier. I just like don't I find them awkward to think about
01:29:22 Uh, and I just haven't like like lists and arrays and stuff are things that you can just make in and I kind of just don't use them
01:29:30 Maybe I don't really need that many of them in what way lists like in the in the way that like
01:29:37 In the way that like um
01:29:41 I don't know what I what I will do
01:29:43 With a thing if I want like an object to perform an action is I will basically just make like a new
01:29:49 variable that exists in
01:29:52 The object
01:29:53 And I and it will be toggleable true false
01:29:56 And if I wanted to do the thing I will just be like, okay set this to true
01:30:00 And then he will you know, he will do that thing
01:30:04 You know and then
01:30:05 So I end up with it has all these different like true false true false true false
01:30:09 Probably maybe I could have used something like an array to like, okay
01:30:12 There is an array of possible states that he is in
01:30:14 And we can switch from one to another
01:30:16 Instead of having like, okay set this one to from true to false and set simultaneously set this one from false to true
01:30:25 in you know like
01:30:27 Just that's just one example at the top of my head of something that like
01:30:30 probably I could have made that
01:30:32 Probably could have made that simpler probably could have I could have like uh future proofed that sort of thing
01:30:38 Yeah, and what I from what I see
01:30:40 a lot of coding is
01:30:43 Like you can do a lot
01:30:45 Uh at a very low skill level, but that's me
01:30:49 The the real like the the the progression of skill is not so much being able to do more complicated things
01:30:55 It's being able to like do simpler things a lot simpler like with a lot with less lines of code with less like
01:31:03 spaghetti everywhere
01:31:05 Yeah, I think so I think so my code my shit is not clean my shit is not clean and it's a mess and it it
01:31:12 Oh man, there was um
01:31:16 Again, this was the thing it was another problem I had this week with um with reflections there was a
01:31:25 Uh, what was it? What was it?
01:31:28 Uh
01:31:30 Shit there was something with a character object in the game that was
01:31:38 What was it doing?
01:31:42 What was it doing it was doing something? Oh, I remember it was like it was um
01:31:50 When the when the turn ended he would not
01:31:55 It would not
01:31:56 Increment a certain variable a certain a certain counter was supposed to count at the end of each turn
01:32:02 So such that at a certain effect would last a certain number of turns and after all the enemies were defeated
01:32:10 You're supposed to be able to continue to take turns like in preparation for the next
01:32:15 room and so but the way that I had it
01:32:18 um
01:32:19 I had written a script that would if there were no enemies
01:32:23 It would simply repeat the turn
01:32:26 But it didn't consider the turn to have ended and a new turn to have begun thus iterating the counter
01:32:32 It would simply like revert back to the beginning of the turn without actually ending it so the timer didn't increment
01:32:38 so I had to
01:32:40 So I knew that this was the problem
01:32:42 and I knew
01:32:43 How to fix it and it was simply a matter I just had to comb through all the code to find like where did I put that
01:32:49 Instruction to repeat the turn. I just need to find it and delete it and I just
01:32:56 Couldn't find it. It took me like an entire day or like a day and a half actually to find this
01:33:01 I knew exactly what it was
01:33:02 It was a one it was a one-line solution and I just couldn't find where to put it and in the end
01:33:06 The reason why I couldn't this is a bit stupid the reason why I couldn't find it was because I had put it in a script
01:33:13 It was in a separate script
01:33:15 That was handling that instruction. So I eventually when I thought maybe it's in a script
01:33:19 I look through my scripts and then I found ah, there it is
01:33:22 There's the like turn repeat script that I just have to go in and I have to take out that
01:33:28 I was I was looking for the instruction itself itself when I should have been looking for the instruction to
01:33:34 uh, you know, um
01:33:36 You know refer to this that script
01:33:39 So I eventually found it and then it was easy to fix
01:33:42 But this is you know, messy. This is this is the kind of thing that happens when your shit is messy sloppy
01:33:48 Uh, but that's me I guess
01:33:53 Code talk
01:33:56 coding
01:33:57 coding
01:34:00 Time to be coming on the pcp to talk about his coding
01:34:05 Tom I'm calling out tom. I'm calling out tom. I'm doing it
01:34:09 I saw people in my discord were asking like, where is tom? Why isn't tom on the pcp?
01:34:15 What why did you change the the pcp recording time to 10 a.m?
01:34:19 Now tom's never on the podcast and I said no
01:34:23 tom was first of all tom was hardly ever on the podcast before
01:34:27 And second of all, I specifically asked tom. Hey tom, do you mind if we change the pcp recording time to 10 a.m?
01:34:35 Would that be a problem for you and he said no, it's fine
01:34:39 And then tom, I got you tom. I fucking got you and then someone in my discord was like
01:34:45 I'm just I'm just saying what he said and I think he posted a screenshot. I think it was from like the im games
01:34:52 Discord server or something where they asked and like hey tom, how come you're never on the podcast anymore and tom said
01:34:57 Uh, well, they changed it to 10 a.m in the morning and that's too early for me. So I don't do so
01:35:02 That's why it's because ben changed it on me
01:35:05 And like no, I fucking asked you
01:35:09 I fucking asked you and you said it was okay
01:35:12 This is excuses excuses excuses
01:35:16 Just say you don't want to be on
01:35:18 What the fuck this made me mad. It's actually made me a little bit mad
01:35:23 It's talking about two sides of your mouth talking on two sides of the mouth. It's weaseling
01:35:28 It's weasel words what it is
01:35:31 Got them caught you
01:35:34 owned
01:35:36 I'm diligent, you know, I I I
01:35:40 I uh, I check I I take care. I take care
01:35:44 Not to fuck people over. I really do
01:35:49 Uh
01:35:51 A little a little credit a little credit would be nice. Um, but it's fine. It doesn't matter
01:35:57 um
01:35:59 Duh
01:36:00 All right
01:36:03 That's probably enough code talk. That's probably enough code talk for now. Um
01:36:08 What's up? What's what what do you think? What's on tell tell me?
01:36:16 I don't know. It's really just the secret project is like full-time job hours working on it and then I've been
01:36:23 stupidly
01:36:25 Fetching out
01:36:26 Doing like idle games and listening to red letter media like usual like normal. It's not good
01:36:33 I was a brief stint where I was like, oh, I'm gonna like watch some actual media. I'm gonna see some anime that I haven't seen
01:36:40 I watched a few but then as soon as I started getting to like
01:36:43 I was watched a few movies
01:36:46 But as soon as I started to get to like the tv shows the anime shows
01:36:50 20 episodes of something I'm like
01:36:52 Uh, you know what? I'll get around to it. It's just that there's too much of a time investment even though individually
01:36:58 The episodes are shorter
01:37:01 I don't want to watch a show
01:37:03 I could be doing I was I could be doing better things
01:37:07 I was starting to watch uh kino's journey, which was sort of interesting
01:37:12 It's about I've seen a bit of that
01:37:14 Get on a motorbike and the motorbike can speak to him
01:37:17 He's like wait is kino a boy
01:37:20 I think so
01:37:22 Oh, he doesn't have a he doesn't have a feminine voice. He looks he's got that 2000s anime like androgynous face
01:37:30 I'm like 90% sure kino's a girl. Well, I don't know maybe I I only watched one or two episodes
01:37:38 Wait now I'm curious uh
01:37:41 Oh wait. No, I noticed they they didn't have like any
01:37:44 Oh, kino's kino's area. Okay kino's
01:37:48 sex is ambiguous in the beginning
01:37:51 She okay. She is a girl
01:37:54 Okay, well, what do they don't they it's like deliberately ambiguous. Okay, whatever. So yeah, all right
01:38:01 I've seen a a bit of it
01:38:04 It used to be on anime network
01:38:06 On demand. I watched a few episodes of it
01:38:10 I think it could be more interesting
01:38:12 It's just sort of quite slow and
01:38:15 melancholic
01:38:17 Yeah, and like uh
01:38:19 Talking about like exist existential stuff and I'm like this feels teenagery. I'm not really interested yet
01:38:26 Like like big brain like what if the universe is like
01:38:30 Stupid what if what if what if life doesn't mean anything? Huh?
01:38:34 Yeah, a little bit of that, but it's not like a stupid version of that. It's it's like it's earnest
01:38:40 So maybe it'll be like cool
01:38:42 I just I wanted to finish it before moving on to some other anime that I have on my list of things to watch
01:38:48 But finishing a show is too hard
01:38:50 Because you have to watch it
01:38:53 And there's a lot of that's true
01:38:56 That's true
01:38:57 So I don't know what to do. Should I continue to watch kino's journey?
01:39:01 Tell me in the comments of what you thought of this anime
01:39:04 You just gotta you just gotta follow your heart
01:39:07 You just gotta let your heart might know my heart is stupid because it leads me to play idle games and look at numbers go up
01:39:14 Damn that is stupid your heart sucks. My heart is like like
01:39:20 I just need to rip it out of me
01:39:25 My heart doesn't like art
01:39:28 I'm ripping out another seltzer
01:39:31 I'm ripping out another sparkling water with a twist of triple berry
01:39:36 What flavor berry refreshing
01:39:38 Huh, what flavor berry?
01:39:41 um
01:39:43 Well from the packaging it seems to be blueberry strawberry blackberry
01:39:49 uh
01:39:52 Yeah, so there you go. That's the answer triple berry
01:39:59 All right, uh, I had one last thing to mention on my weak notes. So I was listening to
01:40:06 I was listening to the uh
01:40:09 Anamorphon time I was catching up on anamorphon time
01:40:13 I was a few episodes behind
01:40:15 and
01:40:16 They they started doing a voicemail segment. I think I might have talked about this tyler from
01:40:21 Anamorphon them asked me how we do our voicemails and I told him about speak pipe
01:40:25 and um
01:40:27 They started doing voicemails
01:40:29 And I am pretty sure that one of our
01:40:33 shit poster
01:40:36 voicemailers
01:40:38 Shitpost voicemail them as well
01:40:41 I should have shut up. I don't remember exactly what his question was
01:40:44 But there was one guy who voicemailed them and he had what I think
01:40:48 Was like a some kind of hispanic accent
01:40:51 but he talked in like a very
01:40:54 Very drawing kind of low voice and kind of slur his words a lot
01:41:01 And I don't remember exactly what he was asking, but he just he's I think he's just asking like
01:41:07 He goes on this like long like tedious
01:41:10 Like uh
01:41:12 Like tell me about life like I don't know what to do about my life. Give me advice about relationships
01:41:19 Uh never had sex and that's the end of the voicemail
01:41:25 And like there it's the episode where they have um
01:41:29 They have chris grine, which is a like the graphic novelist who is drawing the official like animorphs
01:41:35 Like graphic novels
01:41:38 And like need to listen to that
01:41:40 Yes, and he has and I'm and I'm pretty sure that guy has called into the pcp before so
01:41:45 Fuck you guy
01:41:48 Uh
01:41:49 Yeah, I don't know
01:41:51 I think I think it might be my fault because I um
01:41:54 Tyler was asking on twitter like people to leave voicemails for the show and I like retweeted that so
01:42:00 Um, it's probably my doing
01:42:02 Yeah, oops
01:42:04 insanely toxic pcp audience
01:42:07 Exactly exactly
01:42:10 Uh, I thought I'm I'm like I'm I'm like 99 percent sure that same guy has called his voicemail thus before
01:42:18 Hmm
01:42:20 Um, yeah, that's all I got for this week on my list of shit to say
01:42:25 I know the list
01:42:27 I usually I write stupid
01:42:29 I write like a little note or two throughout if something interesting happens like oh, I'll put that on my little text
01:42:34 No, let me bring it up on the show
01:42:36 um
01:42:38 Oh, you want to go to voicemails? Yeah, let's go to voicemails. I didn't really okay. Okay. Um, sure. Well, let me let me pull them up here
01:42:47 Uh, okay, the first one is called
01:42:51 Uh, it's shit. Shit. It's called um
01:42:56 I love you gib or il y gib
01:42:59 Oh, wow
01:43:02 Wow
01:43:04 Three three two one go
01:43:07 Ben Ben Ben. Yeah, can I get uh, uh, happy birthday?
01:43:14 Uh, happy birthday
01:43:18 Happy birthday. Whose birthday is it?
01:43:20 This guy's I guess
01:43:23 Happy birthday
01:43:29 Uh
01:43:31 I hope your birthday is
01:43:34 sexy
01:43:37 God
01:43:38 Next one is called fancy for the love of god
01:43:43 Please for the love of god three two one go
01:43:48 Go back to uploading the pcp mp3s
01:43:51 I need them to listen to the fucking show and they're not on any of the new episodes and fucking all the youtube mp3
01:43:58 Websites aren't working anymore. God listen to the podcast
01:44:04 Um, what did we do about that? I thought we um, we stopped doing that because they're on itunes or something
01:44:11 Or I don't I don't know. I don't I don't remember. Um
01:44:16 Yeah, they're on like itunes and are they on spotify?
01:44:20 There's just there's just itunes
01:44:22 Apple podcasts, maybe the wait they're on the
01:44:26 Okay, you can download the mp3 from a website, right?
01:44:29 Of the procrastinators.com has all the episodes and I believe you can download them as mp3s from the website
01:44:36 Let me check that
01:44:38 The procrastinatorspodcast.com
01:44:42 Um
01:44:44 Yeah
01:44:46 Yeah, you fucking nerd you can literally download them from the website. That's where you go
01:44:51 There's no google doc. There's no google folder anymore. Just go to the website. Oh, yeah problem
01:44:57 Problem solve problem solve. Maybe you didn't know that now, you know, I mean most probably don't know that there's a website for that
01:45:02 but yes
01:45:04 Check that there is a website
01:45:06 by the way, um
01:45:08 Oh
01:45:09 So I wanted some point to release the um the pdf version of road to radcon
01:45:15 I guess I should put that on the website. That seems like the appropriate place to put that
01:45:21 I don't actually I don't actually know how to edit the website though. I don't know how to make a post there
01:45:25 I've never done it
01:45:26 um
01:45:27 Still got the like default like plant at the top
01:45:31 uh
01:45:32 Yeah, I mean Tom uploads uploads the things you know what?
01:45:38 I yeah, I guess I could just ask tom to post the pdf
01:45:44 Uh, yeah, I think I'll do that. I'll I'll ask tom about it. Um
01:45:50 Okay, the next one is called
01:45:53 Uh, shit. Where did I lost it? The next one is called. Uh, it's janez
01:45:58 Here we go
01:45:59 three two one go
01:46:03 What do you think someone should do if they want to improve their commenting skill? Uh, let's play or stream
01:46:10 They're commenting skill
01:46:14 Hmm
01:46:16 Uh, I think a lot of it
01:46:19 Yeah, do do a lot of it
01:46:22 Do a lot of it
01:46:24 I I would say aside from that
01:46:28 It might be a there might be a mindset thing
01:46:32 Try and maintain the mindset
01:46:36 Of that there are no
01:46:38 There there are no, uh, uh
01:46:42 Trying to be the mindset of not caring too much
01:46:45 Uh, be like be like, uh, what if I say something stupid?
01:46:49 I think some people
01:46:51 Are like shy. I think some people maybe
01:46:53 Would be shy in that situation and would hold back. Sure
01:46:57 You should you should not hold back. You should say even if something's stupid
01:47:01 You should be of the mind so that if you say something stupid, that's okay
01:47:05 Because you can just you can just make a joke out of it and laugh at yourself
01:47:09 And uh, and I don't know learn learn not to this learn not to give a fuck about looking stupid
01:47:14 Which is is good advice, uh in general for life
01:47:18 True that in practice are probably too. I'm trying to think because like in in a let's play
01:47:24 I mean, nobody really does let's plays but if you're doing like live streams
01:47:27 um
01:47:29 It depends on why people are watching or what you're trying to do if you're trying to just be a gamer
01:47:34 You don't really need to commentate that much as long as the gameplay is interesting or like high level stuff
01:47:40 I mean if you just haven't fun saying something
01:47:43 You don't well, I mean you do in some certain stances, but like speedrunners don't need to not that you know
01:47:50 It's it's it's nicer if you can
01:47:52 Commentate while you're playing but like if you have okay, well that if the trouble is like
01:47:56 With trying to play a game and speak at the same time
01:48:00 I yeah
01:48:01 Just try to do it and then you'll get the hang of of doing that
01:48:06 But like I don't know if there's like a specific way to get good at it other than that
01:48:11 I don't think I don't really think so and I guess if if if you've got like a
01:48:16 A friend who could be in a call
01:48:19 They could like ask you questions to force your hand for your react
01:48:25 Yeah, I think doing it with another person is a lot easier than doing it by yourself
01:48:31 um, if you're doing it by yourself, yeah, you might
01:48:34 You might just run out of things to say you don't have anyone to bounce off of you have to keep coming up with shit on your own
01:48:40 Um
01:48:42 Yeah, the only thing with oh, yeah, that's that's a good
01:48:45 Yeah, that's a good fallback if you if you are having trouble doing it on your own doing it with someone would be a good uh
01:48:51 Yeah fallback
01:48:54 Next one next voicemail is an image or an imager album
01:48:59 Riley the type of geezer to go down on a chick and be the first one to come
01:49:05 Oh
01:49:07 That's funny
01:49:08 Uh, is it true?
01:49:10 Uh, well, I mean the meme says the meme says it's true. So I have I have to believe it
01:49:16 I have to take it at face value. Well, it's it's not really saying it's true
01:49:20 But he's saying he's the type of geezer where that would happen. Oh
01:49:24 Oh, well, that's
01:49:26 Well, that's true. Obviously
01:49:28 He seems he seems the type
01:49:31 Next one is uh
01:49:33 Is this an image it's a paste ben wait, why is this a paste been?
01:49:39 What the fuck okay, whatever. It's a text file for summary. Why would you
01:49:43 Okay, ben you should make a pcp lecture on the rise and fall of digi, bro
01:49:48 I bet a lot of people would be interested to know what happened to that anime youtuber from 2016
01:49:53 You know, you're not you're not the first person to suggest this
01:49:56 um
01:49:59 Yeah
01:50:01 I mean, I would
01:50:03 Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's not a time I'd consider it. I'd consider it. Maybe it's it's doable. I mean, there's plenty of interesting facts
01:50:12 There there are yeah, there's enough there to make for something of a lecture
01:50:15 I mean genuinely the the problem is just organizing a lecture like when would I have the opportunity to do a lecture?
01:50:23 right
01:50:24 Yeah
01:50:25 That's the biggest obstacle
01:50:28 It'd be like rad con with me and you and tom
01:50:33 Yeah, maybe night. I don't know that that's like I don't know either
01:50:38 I just don't know I just don't know um
01:50:42 Yeah
01:50:47 Honestly, if there was like something
01:50:50 some
01:50:52 New rad con or spiritual successor to a rad con. I probably would I probably would like attempt to do something like this
01:51:00 Just because like why not?
01:51:02 Uh, it would be funny
01:51:04 um
01:51:06 I actually be a lot I'd have to like go back through like
01:51:11 Okay, there were there would be a lot to say there's a lot you could say about the rise and fall of digi, bro
01:51:18 But the hard part is separating the wheat from the chaff because a lot of it would be boring
01:51:24 a lot of it would be like
01:51:26 Oh, and then
01:51:27 you know shit talking about like uh
01:51:30 Like digi bro's turntable or like the hentai samurai. Oh, no, I know what nobody cares about that. It would be entirely like
01:51:38 the drama
01:51:39 People only really want to know about the fall
01:51:43 I mean, yeah
01:51:45 You know, you're kind of right actually
01:51:47 The the other rise would be like youtuber begins and then grows in popularity is like a story everyone knows
01:51:54 Yeah, like you can you give the you give the you give the broad strokes of the rise the rise kind of speaks for itself
01:51:59 Like, okay, this is what they did. This is why they were popular and then what happened. Well, yeah
01:52:05 Honestly, yeah, honestly. Yeah, it's not about it. It's not a bad idea and given the opportunity. I probably would do it
01:52:12 um
01:52:18 Q the Q the
01:52:20 Suddenly yig studios
01:52:22 Is is alerted that I said that and then they become uh, they they
01:52:27 They their new mission is to stop stop the stop rad con at any cost. We can't allow we can't allow another rad con to happen
01:52:33 to be devastating
01:52:35 They have a history of stopping lectures from existing
01:52:38 Yeah
01:52:39 true
01:52:41 They've got a proven track record. They can do it. They love it. They love
01:52:46 They love it. Uh, next voicemail is oh god, it's
01:52:52 You know, I guess this I guess this is a way to get me to read your text message
01:52:58 um
01:52:59 Okay
01:53:01 I'm sorry if you've been told this already, but you don't seem to understand
01:53:05 That mining cryptocurrency and processing cryptocurrency transactions are exactly the same thing
01:53:11 The miners are rewarded a set amount of currency for processing transactions
01:53:16 I don't believe you. I don't think you're right
01:53:19 You have to mine the currency before it can be traded
01:53:24 Trading trading currency
01:53:27 No, you're you're you're wrong
01:53:29 You're just wrong. Do they mean the same thing in terms of energy usage or whatever?
01:53:35 Because that may have been what we would know this guy this guy says they are literally the same thing which they cannot be
01:53:40 It can't that can't be the case. So
01:53:43 dismissed
01:53:45 Next

01:54:39 Okay, this is the this is the kind of video that I like I like seven hour long videos about some bullshit

01:55:58 I'm a bit it's a bit
01:56:00 Dodgy, but I might give it a shot. Maybe I don't know it's one of those things where like
01:56:06 Something that's true in one episode
01:56:08 Will often be true in multiple episodes, but they end up seeing it multiple times
01:56:15 Um didn't uh, oh god that guy um
01:56:19 I think the guy ls mark
01:56:22 He did a video where he goes through every single like all like 700 episodes of the simpsons
01:56:28 And he gives like a little he doesn't give a long summary, but he does like he summarizes like each one
01:56:34 I watched that whole thing
01:56:37 I mean he does you know after a while I
01:56:41 It was pretty good because it wasn't that could get really annoying
01:56:45 But he eventually he starts being like, okay, there's only so much I can say about each of these
01:56:51 Like he doesn't he doesn't like repeat
01:56:53 Hems his his point over and over again for like
01:56:57 Each of the new one like it gets to a point where he's really like rapid firing them like bam bam bam
01:57:03 And like, you know, that's how you got to do it
01:57:06 Um, yeah, I like that one. I like that video. Um

01:57:30 Whatever three two one go
01:57:35 Hey, y'all, it's me again. I just wanted to say that last week's pod was really good and thank you again
01:57:41 Oh, so I wanted to leave a comment for the guest Advil you had on
01:57:46 Hey there
01:57:48 You're a complete coward and I honestly feel sorry for you. Hmm. I watched the video you made and gave up 31 minutes and four seconds in
01:57:55 You talked about looking at things in context and yet you were more than happy to protect a complete garbage of a human
01:58:02 Who's done actual harm to my community?
01:58:04 Just to try and get a dub against pina or whatever the fuck
01:58:08 I'm not going to be cute about it. Go fuck yourself. Hmm
01:58:11 yeah, um
01:58:14 I wouldn't I wouldn't collaborate with antunes under any circumstances
01:58:20 personally
01:58:22 I didn't actually go back and watch
01:58:24 Or listen to the part of the that episode before I arrived. So I don't know what was talked about. Oh
01:58:32 But I don't really care. So that guy. Yeah, that guy. Yeah, he did a he did a video where he talked to
01:58:37 Ethereum and antunes about why daft pina is bad
01:58:44 Yeah, there's there's no way that daft pina is anywhere as bad as antunes. So like
01:58:50 It's pretty stupid. Uh
01:58:54 Yeah, a bunch of people in my discord were
01:58:57 I haven't didn't actually watch the uh the daft pina takedown video or whatever that guy had a bunch of people in my discord
01:59:05 Complained about it and said it was bad for various reasons
01:59:10 Uh
01:59:11 But I don't know that's that's not me talking. I don't have an opinion
01:59:16 um
01:59:17 Okay, next voicemail is another image. So here we go what we got

02:00:16 Hey guys go in one week strong
02:00:18 I haven't made it all week long and I feel better than ever to clarify from last week
02:00:23 Participating in this challenge is to not watch listen or engage with Nate bestman or any of his content for the whole month
02:00:29 Wow, anyone just joining the challenge. I know it can be tough
02:00:33 Yeah, so i'm gonna read an excerpt from an inspirational reddit post about this month's challenge
02:00:38 This comes from reddit user ihdn 2012. He writes. I was addicted to Nate for 20 years
02:00:46 I was lonely miserable and desperately wanted a part sometimes so badly. I wanted to die
02:00:52 Skipping ahead a little he says about two weeks after I stopped watching Nate. I met an amazing woman
02:00:58 I knew that if I was still a Nate addict, I would not find her attractive
02:01:03 She doesn't have the enormous intellect that Nate has
02:01:08 And she is an incredibly perfect person. She is so beautiful to me and I'm way happier now
02:01:14 Wow, isn't that inspiring? I know I'm ready for another week of not nating until next time
02:01:20 No, Nate. Yes watch change change your life change your life the powers in your hands
02:01:25 Lesson is you you just have to take that change your life doesn't really work
02:01:31 Unsubscribe change. Yeah, we're yeah good enough
02:01:34 Um unsubscribe change your life
02:01:38 Nate not even once
02:01:40 Nate even once uh
02:01:42 next
02:01:44 What what what can I say but that I wholeheartedly endorse no, Nate November
02:01:49 um
02:01:50 Next next voicemail is called
02:01:53 Trixie's dignity equals
02:01:56 All right, three two one go
02:02:02 Oh nothing, I get it. It's nothing
02:02:06 There's nothing I thought it was gonna be like I thought it was gonna be like a quote of somebody yelling something
02:02:11 Oh, I thought it was gonna be a fart noise
02:02:15 Yeah
02:02:16 No, okay. All right. I got it. I got it message received
02:02:21 Uh, this is the last voicemail. We didn't have that many this week. Uh, this is uh, Australian father finds out how much pcp makes on patreon
02:02:31 Three two one go
02:02:36 $900 dues
02:02:39 Tobias
02:02:40 Did you send money to patreon.com slash the procrastinators?
02:02:45 Yes, but it was an emergency
02:02:48 Trixie was talking mad shit to a bunch of dickshits
02:02:52 So Ben and Gabe had to react true. Oh my god
02:02:56 She didn't go and get herself ratioed now did she?
02:03:03 No, that's a cool dad
02:03:08 Cool as fucking damn, I wish I had an Australian father
02:03:13 We are up to uh
02:03:15 $954
02:03:17 dollars, I think um
02:03:19 Dollar reduce if we it
02:03:22 It's over
02:03:24 900
02:03:25 Um, if we could get to I think if we could get to 1,050
02:03:30 So if we got another hundred dollars, we would have tripled our patreon in over the last like three months
02:03:37 Uh, which would be really now. I mean we're all we've almost tripled it, which is pretty good. Thanks everyone for your pledges. Um
02:03:44 Yeah, hey what I would suggest what I would suggest
02:03:52 And I mean this in an entirely legal
02:03:55 Way and that I am not responsible for anything, but I would suggest uh, I would suggest goading
02:04:00 I would suggest goading Trixie into into making more
02:04:05 podcast appearance into uh making more uh
02:04:08 Making more statements against us. Uh, I really want more of those. Uh, they've been a
02:04:13 They've been a huge boon
02:04:16 Uh, uh, uh to us. So, uh, uh, I want more you want more
02:04:21 Um, send send her like I don't know send her like lies about us
02:04:25 Tell her that she that we said things we didn't say
02:04:28 And have her get mad just make her mad
02:04:32 Um
02:04:35 I don't like you disavow you disavow
02:04:38 um, I think it's funny but like
02:04:41 It's it's like I don't know. I don't think it'll work
02:04:45 And I'd rather not
02:04:47 Lies being flung around even in a joke way
02:04:50 I would like for lies
02:04:52 Who knows how many dick show fans will latch onto that and agree with it
02:04:58 Maybe even two maybe three people three care in any way about the procrastinators
02:05:04 Then we can't have that we can't have that we can't have that
02:05:08 We're we're we only need every one. It's really funny because like like if if if it results in like Trixie's spreading lies about us who
02:05:18 Will pay attention and also who will care. It's really no one so I know but it's not much of like a reason not to do it
02:05:26 Exactly. That's what I'm saying. I don't know. I'm just
02:05:29 I feel like all right. All right. Trixie is a person of very low intelligence, but I think even even she
02:05:36 probably
02:05:37 Noticed that like hmm when I tried to attack the pcp
02:05:43 I made a fool of myself and gave them a bunch of money
02:05:47 Uh, I won't do that. I shouldn't do that again and
02:05:51 And you know that chill that chilling effect is unfortunate
02:05:54 Because I want it to continue, uh, but I feel I feel like maybe it won't I feel like even she may have learned the lesson and that's a shame
02:06:03 Uh, so I don't know
02:06:06 of
02:06:08 I don't know
02:06:09 Can't can't force her just can't force her to make a fool of herself, but uh, I don't know. Oh, she'll do it
02:06:14 Just give her a chill. She'll she's
02:06:17 I really think that she the the the the recent spate of like the recent spate of of uh
02:06:24 outspoken
02:06:26 attacks and and and
02:06:28 She's because she's become more active on twitter and I and I think
02:06:31 I sense that I sense that something is is something is shifting there something is is
02:06:38 Things are things are hitting the fan or things are coming to you ahead and and uh
02:06:43 The the the the the
02:06:46 The the
02:06:47 There will be there will be hostility. I feel like I feel like we are coming to a point where there may there may be greater hostility
02:06:53 Um, because I mean once once she's lost everything like what else will there be for her except to like
02:06:59 Lash out, right? So, you know, hopefully that day comes soon
02:07:04 Uh, but I guess we'll see
02:07:07 um
02:07:09 Anyway patreon.com slash the procrastinators

02:07:54 Damn
02:07:55 If only he'd if only he'd been alive to say if only he'd been alive to well, I won't say I won't say what he should have done
