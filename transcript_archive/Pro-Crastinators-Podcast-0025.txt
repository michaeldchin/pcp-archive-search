00:00:00 We can climb the bus right here.
00:00:15 Okay, we need to lighten the mood. Ready?
00:00:19 It doesn't matter how much you push the envelope, it'll still be stationary.
00:00:24 What is that?
00:00:26 It's a joke book. No pun intended. Vol. 2 by Will Livingston.
00:00:32 Let's keep going.
00:00:34 What did the Confederate soldiers used to eat off of?
00:00:38 Civilware.
00:00:41 What did they used to drink with?
00:00:45 Cups. Dixie cups.
00:00:50 I walked into my sister's room and tripped on a bra.
00:00:55 It was a booby trap.
00:01:00 A book just fell on my head. I only have myself to blame.
00:01:05 Hold on, let me read it again.
00:01:07 A book just fell on my head. I only have my shelf to blame.
00:01:13 Ruin it.
00:01:16 What is the leading cause of divorce in long-term marriages?
00:01:22 A stalemate.
00:01:24 That's awful.
00:01:25 You're awful.
00:01:26 Do you even understand what that means?
00:01:28 Nope. Doesn't matter.
00:01:31 Alright, I'm done. For now.
00:01:52 Jeff of the Mother's Basement.
00:01:55 Hi, hello. This is me again.
00:01:58 And the rebel pixel himself, Tom Oliver.
00:02:01 Yeah.
00:02:04 Alright, so guy, who do I have to fuck around here to get started on this podcast?
00:02:11 I've been waiting for all this time.
00:02:13 Let's get this thing going already.
00:02:16 That was some good witty dialogue right there.
00:02:18 What we had going right there.
00:02:20 Yeah, I suppose.
00:02:22 Well, I've seen better witty on Tuesday.
00:02:26 Now, let's begin this conversation.
00:02:29 Witty banter, what you say?
00:02:32 Witty, what now?
00:02:35 I'm comedically pretending not to understand the phrase.
00:02:39 Alright, I don't understand what anyone's saying right now,
00:02:42 but the point is, the topic of the podcast is witty, witty.
00:02:47 Alright, the topic of the podcast is witty banter,
00:02:50 and we've all got feelings about it,
00:02:52 but really, I think we need to take a good long time to describe exactly what each of us is thinking of.
00:02:57 Shall we open up Urban Dictionary and look up witty banter?
00:03:00 Witty banter is what the lowlifes do over and fly over country when they're not busy picking corn.
00:03:10 Well, okay, I looked it up on Urban Dictionary, and here's what we've got.
00:03:14 Even if they are ugly, the witty banter will redeem their unfortunate looks.
00:03:28 And here's the quote.
00:03:31 Alright, listen to my example here.
00:03:33 This is a real life usage from the Gilmore Girls.
00:03:37 Jake had the best witty banter yesterday.
00:03:41 I know it totally made me want to bone him.
00:03:44 This is a great jumping off point, because whoever wrote that is totally under the persuasion
00:03:54 that if someone can snap off a real quick witty one liner,
00:03:58 if someone can snap off some real cutting jpe or jab or jib or whatever it would have you,
00:04:04 then that's cool, and they're a cool guy and it's funny.
00:04:08 And if you can write someone whipping off one liners and zinging people off, snap, ice burn,
00:04:16 then that's good writing, and I don't think so.
00:04:19 I think that that is an overused thing in fiction and in writing in general,
00:04:26 and that it's a crutch that a lot of people use, and I don't like it.
00:04:30 I'm sure there's times when it's appropriate, but most of them are not.
00:04:35 The only kind of reminds me of, the scene that comes to my mind most of all when I think about this is,
00:04:40 and maybe it's a bad example, but the scene in Metal Gear Solid 4, where...
00:04:44 By the way, I'm Ben St. St. Cops.
00:04:46 Patreon.com slash Ben St.
00:04:49 If you enjoyed this kind of witty commentary, you can head over to Patreon.com.
00:04:54 If you enjoyed the couple sentences I just said, please consider supporting me.
00:04:57 Alright, but what I was saying was that, you know that scene in Metal Gear Solid 4
00:05:01 when Poop Man and Meryl are fighting for their lives at the end of the game
00:05:06 and they're talking about their wedding that's coming up,
00:05:08 while they're getting murdered by everyone around them all the time.
00:05:11 It was really uncomfortable, and this seems to happen a lot with this stuff,
00:05:17 where something really serious is going on,
00:05:20 and I don't know if they think that they can inject some levity into it,
00:05:24 when, meanwhile, Snake is crawling to his death over here,
00:05:28 he's being fucking cooked alive by microwaves,
00:05:30 well, these two are like, oh, we're gonna get such pretty dresses, boom, killed another guy,
00:05:34 oh, we're gonna have all the flowers, it's gonna be awesome, boom, killed five more people,
00:05:38 got shot in the arm.
00:05:39 It's, you know, it's not something you can just add slap on top of something
00:05:44 to just like enhance what's going on.
00:05:46 I mean, in Metal Gear Solid, that is kind of to an extent the point,
00:05:50 because Metal Gear Solid is, you know, I mean,
00:05:54 it's part Hideo Kojima's crazy fucking fever dream fantasy
00:05:59 about what's really going on in the world,
00:06:01 and all the secret conspiracies,
00:06:04 but the other thing that it is, is it's a send up of action movies, right?
00:06:08 Like, yeah, so that's something that they do in action movies all the time,
00:06:13 and it's not necessarily about like, you know, being respectful in the moment,
00:06:18 it's about being entertaining to the viewer.
00:06:22 The idea is to portray coolness that makes people really impressed,
00:06:26 like, these people are so excited about what they're talking about,
00:06:29 in an action movie.
00:06:31 Davoo, shut up, he's trying to say something.
00:06:33 In an action movie, you guys gotta turn my volume on, discord back up.
00:06:37 I was done talking for like five seconds
00:06:39 when everyone told me to shut up the stupid lab.
00:06:42 Yeah, yeah, okay, so what's, so the thing is, in an action movie,
00:06:48 violence isn't like a bad thing, violence is performance art.
00:06:52 So in that sense, you know, throwing wit on top of that
00:06:55 and trying to make it as funny and entertaining for the audience as possible,
00:06:59 is in service of the goal of the scene.
00:07:02 So like, when Arnold Schwarzenegger fucking freezes somebody to death
00:07:09 in Batman and Robin, and he's just like,
00:07:11 what killed the dinosaurs?
00:07:13 The eye sage, I mean, that's a terrible example,
00:07:15 but that's, that is, I mean, that's a great example.
00:07:19 I actually think that that's hilarious, but what I'm saying,
00:07:23 like, the things happening in that scene of Metal Gear Solid 4
00:07:25 are in the same sort of situation as like episode one of Star Wars,
00:07:29 where like, there's this big battle where all these different scenes are happening simultaneously,
00:07:33 and one of them is like this witty banter while they're fucking fighting.
00:07:37 Well meanwhile over here, Snake is fucking dying.
00:07:39 But that's done for the sake of juxtaposition, right?
00:07:42 Yeah, here's, I have not seen, I have not played Metal Gear Solid 4,
00:07:46 so disclaimer about that, but it sounds to me like what the scene is trying to do,
00:07:50 like one, it's trying to be goofy and funny in that they can have this conversation
00:07:54 while they're fighting for their lives ostensibly.
00:07:57 Also, I think the other thing maybe it's going for is that these two are like
00:08:01 such good and powerful super soldiers that they can have this kind of conversation
00:08:06 while like, Run of the Mill mooks are gunning them down, is that, is that maybe part of it?
00:08:10 Tell us a little about whether or not it makes sense.
00:08:12 You know, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that's what they were going for.
00:08:15 Like it doesn't even take their full concentration to engage in this firefight?
00:08:18 Yeah, and this is like the ultimate battle of their lives,
00:08:21 okay, but you know what, whatever, I'll give that to you.
00:08:24 That's meant to be the comedic side of it, right?
00:08:27 Like, that's a common thing in film to juxtapose something that's goofy and light hearted
00:08:33 with the most serious moment of the film in order to elicit like,
00:08:38 in order to take people on like an emotional roller coaster and keep them engaged.
00:08:42 Like, I don't know if you've seen the movie Cloud Atlas,
00:08:46 but Cloud Atlas is effectively five different shorter movies,
00:08:50 each with vastly different tones and subject matters.
00:08:53 And one of them is basically like a British slapstick comedy
00:08:57 and it's got like this really goofy chase scene
00:09:01 where like a bunch of old people are running away from like a home
00:09:06 and that's juxtaposed with this super dramatic scene
00:09:09 where these two slaves are trying to escape from being captured
00:09:14 and trying to find freedom, these like clone slaves.
00:09:17 It's a weird movie.
00:09:19 I think I saw it.
00:09:20 And there's like a few other things and like that's,
00:09:23 the purpose of that is to compare and contrast
00:09:27 and make the funnier parts of that funnier and make the dramatic parts
00:09:32 of the other scenes more dramatic in comparison.
00:09:36 I'll give you all of that and I'll say that that is totally something
00:09:39 that you can do effectively, but you have to admit that there is a right way
00:09:43 and a wrong way to do those things.
00:09:45 And my only contention is that in my humble opinion,
00:09:47 I think Metal Gear Solid 4 did it the wrong way for that one scene.
00:09:50 That's all I'm saying.
00:09:51 I mean, Kojima is not a very good film director.
00:09:54 He's a terrible writer and he's not a great director.
00:09:57 Let me talk about a good writer
00:09:59 and someone who used Witty Banter in a way that I like a lot.
00:10:02 George R.R. Martin in Game of Thrones, right?
00:10:05 Yeah, okay.
00:10:06 I mean, in Game of Thrones, not every character engages in Witty Banter, right?
00:10:11 True.
00:10:12 Like Ned never, I think at some point Ned even thinks to himself like,
00:10:16 man, I can't do this sparring with words that everyone does here
00:10:20 and keeps landing.
00:10:21 It sucks and I can't do it and I hate it.
00:10:22 Let's just, yeah, let's just get on with what we're doing here.
00:10:25 Like Tyrion is this kind of snarky guy who doesn't have any respect for anyone
00:10:30 and just sort of will flippantly say what he thinks all the time.
00:10:33 And people like Varys and Littlefinger are these kind of like crafty dudes
00:10:38 who like engage in all these, you know, court politics and stuff
00:10:42 and they're always like trying to advance their station
00:10:44 with like a well-placed word and a whisper and whatever.
00:10:47 So like those kind of characters do have this sort of Witty Banter
00:10:50 but then other characters like Brienne is like dumb as a stump
00:10:55 and never could never in the books anyway.
00:10:57 Hey, that's misogynist.
00:10:58 No, in the book she's so dumb and she's also my favorite character.
00:11:01 She's not that dumb.
00:11:02 I don't remember that.
00:11:03 To me, she comes off as pretty dumb in the books.
00:11:06 Oh, doesn't George R. Martin say at some point
00:11:08 that she's supposed to be really dumb or something?
00:11:10 I don't know.
00:11:11 I know he called Victarian dumb as a stump.
00:11:13 Oh, right.
00:11:14 That's what it was.
00:11:15 But anyway, like she would never engage in that.
00:11:18 The Starks generally wouldn't, things like that.
00:11:22 So what do you get that?
00:11:23 Did you like the way Tyrion did it?
00:11:25 I'm just saying that it's appropriate in some context
00:11:29 but not all of them and in that series the characters are in.
00:11:33 Ben, maybe if I can springboard off that,
00:11:35 I think what you're trying to say is that like Witty Dialogue
00:11:38 and like Witty Banter is a character trait and not a writing crutch
00:11:42 because there are a lot of...
00:11:44 There's so many times where you can have a Witty character
00:11:47 but like something that I, as much as I like the MCU and shit,
00:11:50 everybody has Witty Banter.
00:11:52 It's not a character trait anymore
00:11:54 because like every character in those movies fucking snaps one line.
00:11:57 And if you want to have...
00:11:59 That's exactly the issue that I was trying to raise with this topic.
00:12:03 That is what I'm complaining about.
00:12:05 Whether personality traits are Witty and cool
00:12:09 and they do snarky things like that.
00:12:11 When a writer basically conflates a character
00:12:15 being clever with the actual script being clever.
00:12:18 A writer tries to show how smart they are
00:12:21 by giving the character smart dialogue even though it's appropriate.
00:12:24 One of the interesting things about the MCU
00:12:27 because I think overall that the MCU is well written.
00:12:31 By the way, I have not seen very much of the MCU.
00:12:34 What's the MCU?
00:12:36 I would say Marvel Cinematic Universe.
00:12:39 Marvel Cinematic Universe.
00:12:41 I would say that the MCU does run into that problem
00:12:46 with certain writers.
00:12:47 Joss Whedon.
00:12:49 He's the one.
00:12:50 He's the guy.
00:12:51 Yeah, so...
00:12:52 Jeff, you need the Lawsons.
00:12:54 I got some water here.
00:12:56 Saying something cough, saying something cough.
00:12:59 Very shade dialogue.
00:13:01 Hey, that's Witty dialogue.
00:13:02 That's pretty witty, yeah.
00:13:05 But yeah, Joss Whedon does that a lot.
00:13:08 Sometimes it works like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer
00:13:12 when you've got a bunch of high school kids trying to prove something.
00:13:16 Yeah, it makes sense for those kids to be engaging in that kind of banter.
00:13:20 In Firefly where the tone is cowboys.
00:13:27 It kind of makes sense in Cabin in the Woods.
00:13:29 It kind of makes sense.
00:13:30 But it gets exhausting when every superhero is trying to one-up each other
00:13:35 including Bruce Banner, who's by his very character a man of few words.
00:13:40 And Iron Man is the only character in that who should be really doing that all the time.
00:13:48 Black Widow, she's an assassin.
00:13:51 Yeah, and the problem with that is as soon as it blew up,
00:13:55 everyone started writing all the characters like that.
00:13:58 And it's unfortunate.
00:14:01 But I mean, in the main movies, or not the main movies,
00:14:04 I guess the side movies where each character gets their own thing,
00:14:07 the writing's a lot better because they're allowed to actually breathe and tell a story
00:14:13 as opposed to just, here's a bunch of people, we want them to bounce off the walls
00:14:17 and get people to give us an 8 out of 10 on IMDb or whatever.
00:14:24 That's all you need and you're in the clear at that point.
00:14:26 It gets really interesting with Captain America Civil War
00:14:31 because they do break away from that at some points.
00:14:34 And Spider-Man, who is a character who a lot of people define by his witty dialogue,
00:14:39 ends up being one of the most interesting characters in that movie
00:14:43 because of how he's written.
00:14:45 He's clearly trying to be witty, but he's using it as a defense mechanism
00:14:50 and he's pissing his pants scared and you can tell that from how he's written.
00:14:55 Which I've heard people say that they've interpreted that's how Spider-Man has always been.
00:14:59 That's why he has all that witty dialogue.
00:15:04 That is how Spider-Man has always been and that's why Andrew Garfield,
00:15:08 and that's why Andrew Garfield's fucking terrible and the Amazing Spider-Man series
00:15:12 can go fucking die in a fire, witty dialogue ruined that too,
00:15:16 in addition to fucking Mark Webb not knowing how to direct anything other than a music video.
00:15:22 Mark Webb.
00:15:23 Yeah, that's who they brought on to direct Spider-Man!
00:15:27 It makes sense, dude. It makes sense.
00:15:29 That seems like a corporate decision to me.
00:15:31 Ten out of ten on that one.
00:15:33 That seems like a corporate business meeting where they were trying to have witty dialogue,
00:15:37 like somebody's like, how...
00:15:42 Yeah, you know, like Jeff was alluding to, you know,
00:15:44 the corporate decisions are falling victim to witty dialogue themselves.
00:15:47 Holy shit, let the dude talk, man.
00:15:50 Yeah, I have to really get a head start with all this lag.
00:15:53 Man, so much lag around here.
00:15:55 It's worse than Sarah Palin.
00:15:58 So, you know...
00:16:01 Did he just say that?
00:16:04 And we hear him cut out as everybody laughs.
00:16:08 Like eight minutes later.
00:16:10 If you want to have a show where everyone is talking inappropriately,
00:16:14 with inappropriate levels of levity when they're all doing death-defying stunts,
00:16:18 you know, it's all about whether or not it makes sense for the characters.
00:16:21 Cowboy Bebop's a good example because the three...
00:16:24 All the main characters in that show are all really bad at talking about their problems
00:16:30 and how they feel and they don't like talking about themselves or anything seriously.
00:16:33 It's true.
00:16:34 And I think it's always been suggested that it's because they all have the same kind of personality in that regard.
00:16:42 That's kind of what makes them naturally team up in the first place
00:16:45 and the fact that they all smoke.
00:16:47 And there's these natural causes for the witty dialogue to happen.
00:16:50 Now, it's part of the story and that's what wit is all about.
00:16:54 We say witty.
00:16:55 Witty means smart, intelligent, creative.
00:16:58 But at some point, some witty, intelligent, creative person invented dialogue
00:17:03 where all the characters were taking a bunch of rhetorical jabs at one another back and forth
00:17:08 and everyone associated that with witty and then proceeded to copy it in a way that wasn't witty at all.
00:17:14 It's like if you ever listened to the...
00:17:17 There was... Ron Tomatoes had a show.
00:17:19 They had a web show where they would play a bunch of people trying to do the stereotypical film critic type of reviews
00:17:25 for a movie and a montage and it was all a bunch of witty dialogue.
00:17:29 Like, ugh, these two people didn't have very good performances.
00:17:33 It was about as good as a deflated balloon.
00:17:37 And it wasn't very witty at all.
00:17:42 That's cool.
00:17:44 So what we're saying is witty dialogue, as it stands today, is not very witty.
00:17:50 Sounds like you're saying that the definition has morphed a bit.
00:17:54 And what we perceive now is not...
00:17:56 I suppose I'd like to think that the origin for all these was because it was in keeping with the way that we wanted the characters to be portrayed.
00:18:04 But perhaps now, like with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's more about...
00:18:08 I was going to say this before, maybe audiences just like everyone to be doing that shit.
00:18:13 Or they've come to associate that with smart dialogue and good characters.
00:18:18 I think the definition now, I think, is the characters themselves thinking of themselves as witty.
00:18:26 I think that's the new definition.
00:18:28 I think it might come back to that definition that you read to us, the urban dictionary thing.
00:18:35 About men who need to get laid even though they're ugly using...
00:18:39 To an extent, that definitely works.
00:18:43 Look at Casey Neistat. He's married.
00:18:48 That came across as mean. He's a very intelligent person.
00:18:51 What I'm trying...
00:18:52 It's okay. People are ugly. It's alright.
00:18:54 What I'm trying to get across, though, is like...
00:18:59 I think maybe a lot of screenwriters and a lot of Hollywood people are just trying to create characters
00:19:06 that people online will say they want to fuck.
00:19:09 Look at the Avengers. Everyone's like, I want to fuck Chris Hemsworth.
00:19:14 I want to fuck Loki. I want to fuck Captain America.
00:19:17 I want to fuck Robert Downey. They want to fuck all those characters.
00:19:22 You have your Jeff Soundboard. Get working.
00:19:26 Oh, no!
00:19:29 Now everyone's going to know everyone I want to fuck!
00:19:33 They didn't before by watching my live streams at youtube.com.
00:19:37 But no, that's kind of a facetious thing.
00:19:44 I think it's true for certain writers.
00:19:47 The person Digi asked us to bring up Diablo Cody.
00:19:51 Diablo Cody can't write a scene where somebody doesn't have a quip about something.
00:19:59 When she's working with other people's characters and she's working within other script constraints,
00:20:08 like when she did the script revisions for the Evil Dead,
00:20:11 like the remake, which is one of the only good remakes,
00:20:14 I think we brought this up on our remakes podcast.
00:20:16 We did. We did.
00:20:17 And when she was like a guest writer for Children's Hospital,
00:20:21 which great show, if you guys haven't seen Children's Hospital, that's good.
00:20:25 But when she writes her own scripts, when she writes shit like fucking Jennifer's body,
00:20:31 or Juno, like it's insufferable.
00:20:36 It can be absolutely insufferable to hear all these, like, again, with teenagers, it kind of works.
00:20:43 I was going to say that the thing that I do like about it with Juno
00:20:46 is that you really, at least when I watched that movie,
00:20:48 I got the feeling that these people were really trying to act super cool,
00:20:52 and they totally aren't.
00:20:53 And like Ellen Page is totally that kind of person in that movie.
00:20:56 She is not cool at all, but she's really trying to act that way.
00:20:59 And I remember till the day I die, at the very beginning,
00:21:02 when she does the pregnancy test and walks up to the, what's his face from the offices up there,
00:21:06 and he's just like, your ego is prego.
00:21:09 That's the greatest line I've ever heard in any movie ever.
00:21:12 It is pretty good.
00:21:13 The problem for me with Juno is that I watched Jennifer's body after watching Juno,
00:21:20 and that throws in, like that movie is so bad that it throws in the question, her ability to write,
00:21:26 and will make you think like, was Juno really that good?
00:21:30 That's fair.
00:21:31 That's fair.
00:21:32 You know, did she just bamboozle us by getting lucky?
00:21:36 God.
00:21:37 Like the script would have been the same no matter who the characters were,
00:21:40 but it happens to work because they're teenagers or something.
00:21:43 Yeah.
00:21:44 Another person who has this problem is Aaron Sorkin,
00:21:49 who's the writer of The West Wing, The Newsroom, Social Network, a bunch of others.
00:21:54 I would consider him to be a great writer,
00:21:58 but a lot of people are put off by the fact that all of his characters
00:22:01 are basically always trying to save the wittiest thing in any given situation,
00:22:06 and a lot of them are just mouthpieces for his political views.
00:22:10 But if you've watched The West Wing, if you've watched The Newsroom,
00:22:15 the dude writes a stirring speech.
00:22:17 The dude can make a scene just like move you,
00:22:21 but to an extent, I think that his desire to impress you with,
00:22:29 oh, this pun that these characters came up with on the fly based on a situation that I wrote,
00:22:34 which doesn't make it impressive at all,
00:22:37 trying to impress you with that witt can take away from how good his characters actually are,
00:22:45 because they're well-defined and they've got a lot of depth to them,
00:22:48 but in the moment-to-moment thing, they come across as being a little,
00:22:53 ugh, this shit again, you know?
00:22:55 Yeah, you know, that's interesting,
00:22:58 and I kind of want to raise a distinction based on what DeVoo was saying before,
00:23:01 and what everybody's been saying.
00:23:02 That's like the new type of witty banter where the characters think they're really clever,
00:23:07 versus actually clever dialogue between characters.
00:23:09 So like, I'm thinking of Quentin Tarantino as the guy that comes to mind for me,
00:23:13 with like, in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction,
00:23:16 but like, the Reservoir Dogs tipping scene at the very beginning of the movie.
00:23:20 Oh, I actually just recently watched that first scene.
00:23:22 That whole first scene is brilliant.
00:23:24 That is like my favorite movie of all time.
00:23:26 To sound like natural dialogue,
00:23:28 but condensed and compressed just enough to make it perfect.
00:23:31 Right.
00:23:32 Yeah, it's witty.
00:23:33 I mean, the guy writing it's witty.
00:23:34 What makes that so witty?
00:23:35 And the characters themselves are also witty.
00:23:36 Everyone is witty.
00:23:37 The writer and the characters are all doing a great job.
00:23:38 That's what I'm saying, because the thing is, in the scene,
00:23:42 he's making an actually fairly persuasive argument as to why tipping is bullshit,
00:23:47 and you shouldn't do, I mean, obviously, you know,
00:23:49 people are not even going to agree.
00:23:50 This is this character's interpretation of what tipping is,
00:23:53 which obviously comes from, you know, some element down in Tarantino
00:23:57 that he's had this thought that tipping is kind of retarded,
00:23:59 and it's being expressed with these characters,
00:24:01 and they're all relating to it in a reasonable way.
00:24:04 And it's totally good.
00:24:05 And my favorite thing about that scene is that Mr. Orange is like,
00:24:08 you know what, I'm convinced.
00:24:09 It's giving me my dollar back.
00:24:10 I'm not tipping anymore.
00:24:11 Like, he convinces another character using this real life argument,
00:24:14 and that's real wit.
00:24:16 And I'm a little bit convinced by that too.
00:24:18 That's a real wit.
00:24:19 I already had that guy's position.
00:24:21 I mean, I do tip, but I totally agree with his philosophy going into it even.
00:24:25 Yeah, man.
00:24:26 The way that like characters are walking to the scene later on,
00:24:30 and like they have to, because there's a part where like the older guy
00:24:33 comes back into the scene later on,
00:24:35 and they have to like repeat some of the information.
00:24:37 What do you mean you don't, Tim?
00:24:39 Yeah, but it's doing just such a way to where it's even more funny
00:24:42 to hear it all over again.
00:24:43 It's great stuff.
00:24:44 I feel like Tarantino, he, his dialogue is, has wit to it,
00:24:54 but that's because he makes every scene like about something
00:24:59 as opposed to just being about two characters bouncing off of each other.
00:25:03 You know another great example of this is, is that scene in,
00:25:06 I forget the movie.
00:25:07 He wrote like one scene for this movie.
00:25:09 God, I can't remember the name.
00:25:11 But basically there's this speech where, fuck, what's his name?
00:25:15 Christopher Walken is, he's like a mob boss,
00:25:18 and he's, you know, you know the one I'm talking about
00:25:20 where he calls him an eggplant?
00:25:22 And he just, he explains to this guy who's like a Sicilian mobster
00:25:27 that like Sicilians, like Sicilian women were raped by like the Moors,
00:25:33 who were black, who took over Sicily for a time,
00:25:36 and that's why Sicilians now have dark hair.
00:25:38 And he's just like, what I'm saying is you're a nigger.
00:25:40 Like he's just like, he builds up to this like,
00:25:43 slandering like his bloodline and shit.
00:25:45 But it's so funny.
00:25:46 And like this whole speech goes in a huge tangent about like the history of Sicily,
00:25:50 and like all that's happening is that he's telling this guy to fuck off
00:25:53 and that he's not going to do what he wants.
00:25:55 But it's hilarious, the way that he does that through this big story
00:25:59 that's historically accurate.
00:26:00 That kind of reminds me of that scene in Hateful Eight
00:26:04 where Samuel L. Jackson tells that long story
00:26:08 about horribly torturing and murdering this kid
00:26:11 and cuts out of it with him being like,
00:26:14 yep, he had my big black dingus in his mouth.
00:26:21 That was a fantastic movie and a fantastic scene.
00:26:25 I don't know if I'd call it fantastic.
00:26:28 It had its perks, I guess.
00:26:30 I quite enjoy all of Tarantino's movies, except for Death Proof,
00:26:35 because I haven't seen that one.
00:26:37 That's his half of Grindhouse, and it's not great.
00:26:40 Planet Terror is a lot better.
00:26:43 I think Robert Rodriguez is just a lot better at doing schlock.
00:26:46 But anyway, you look at pretty much any dialogue exchange
00:26:52 in any of his films, and there's something going on
00:26:55 that's building up the characters,
00:26:57 and their wit always relates to who they are as a person.
00:27:02 He frequently plays witty characters off against dumber characters
00:27:08 who are also morally more in the right than them.
00:27:12 If you look at, say, In Glorious Bastards, fantastic movie,
00:27:18 the first scene of that movie is one of the greatest opening scenes
00:27:23 in any movie ever, and just that conversation
00:27:26 between Christoph Waltz and the farmer,
00:27:30 where he's saying all of this witty shit,
00:27:33 and the farmer's just sort of being meek
00:27:36 because of the position that he's in,
00:27:38 and also he's not hyper-educated,
00:27:41 but at the same time, you're relating more to the farmer's position,
00:27:45 and it's less like, oh, look how clever this character is,
00:27:49 although he is being clever.
00:27:50 It's more like, look at this asshole, right?
00:27:53 Look at how clever this guy wants us to think.
00:27:55 He's got so much power over this guy, intellectually, politically.
00:27:59 He's got every advantage over the guy.
00:28:01 So you kind of feel like, damn, this guy's the coolest.
00:28:04 I want to be with this guy.
00:28:05 That's the reversal of the usual,
00:28:08 or of the trap that I think two witty banter can fall into,
00:28:12 wherein have you guys seen that it's a comic,
00:28:15 but it's like a parody of social issue comics,
00:28:19 where there's two characters talking,
00:28:21 and one guy, he's kind of a smart, nerd-looking guy,
00:28:24 and the other is this sort of crudely drawn, big, yell-y guy,
00:28:27 and the little glasses guy is like, I have this opinion,
00:28:31 and the other's like, I disagree, and I hate you.
00:28:34 And then the glasses guy's like, I keep my cool,
00:28:37 and I'm the bigger man, and the other guy's like, not me,
00:28:40 I'm so fucking crazy.
00:28:43 The first panel is the smart guy being like,
00:28:46 I have this opinion, which I share with the author of this comic.
00:28:50 And the other guy's like, I have this alternate opinion,
00:28:53 that is contrary.
00:28:55 So they're basically just like completely straw manning
00:28:58 the other guy, the other arguments.
00:29:00 And yeah, you see that all the time.
00:29:02 You see that all the time in web comics and stuff.
00:29:04 You make a character that is arguing.
00:29:06 That's all of Tumblr, basically.
00:29:08 You make a character that you agree with,
00:29:10 and that you want the audience to agree with,
00:29:12 and then you have him try to look cool, and be cool,
00:29:16 and get one over on the enemy,
00:29:18 and say something that really cuts the meat that the other guy
00:29:21 obviously has no rebuttal for.
00:29:23 You know what the perfect example this is?
00:29:25 The author didn't think of what a reasonable rebuttal would be.
00:29:27 Are you thinking of Brian Griffin from Family Guy?
00:29:29 Because he's exactly that character.
00:29:30 But I mean, Brian Griffin is supposed to be full of shit,
00:29:33 because he's the stand-in for Seth MacFarlane.
00:29:37 And everybody who writes that show
00:29:42 uses Brian to make fun of what an asshole Seth MacFarlane is.
00:29:46 The episode where Brian tries to be a stand-up comedian,
00:29:55 for instance, is all about how shitty a stand-up comedian
00:29:58 Seth MacFarlane is.
00:30:00 Any time that Brian expresses a political opinion
00:30:03 like an asshole, that's Seth MacFarlane.
00:30:05 Right, that's true.
00:30:07 But yeah, the thing that those Tumblr comics remind me of
00:30:10 is fucking the Mac versus PC ads,
00:30:14 and how those made me want to buy a PC.
00:30:16 Oh yeah.
00:30:17 Because fuck Mac.
00:30:19 Yeah.
00:30:21 I always liked the PC guy better anyway.
00:30:23 Fuck that hipster asshole Mac.
00:30:25 Exactly, he's like this down to earth.
00:30:27 Are you guys familiar with the response ads that Microsoft did?
00:30:32 I don't know, maybe.
00:30:34 They just showed a bunch of people who own PCs
00:30:36 going off being cool people living their real lives
00:30:39 that don't have anything to do with computers.
00:30:41 And they're like,
00:30:42 Bravo, Microsoft, good job.
00:30:45 Exactly.
00:30:46 I remember people hated those commercials, too.
00:30:48 Like the tech sphere,
00:30:50 because I have to go on tech blogs all the time,
00:30:52 and everyone's like, these commercials are so cool.
00:30:54 And then the PC ones came out,
00:30:55 and they were so much more subtle and clever in response.
00:30:57 And everyone's like, these are gay.
00:30:59 They don't even show the computer.
00:31:01 Subtle and clever.
00:31:03 That only should apply to Whitty Banter,
00:31:05 but also PC users.
00:31:07 Meanwhile, Microsoft did earlier on
00:31:09 have an ad campaign that was very snarky.
00:31:11 Whitty Banter's become snarky banter.
00:31:14 Right.
00:31:15 Because Microsoft also had an ad campaign
00:31:17 that was very snarky from earlier on
00:31:19 during the height,
00:31:21 down the peak of all the hatred delivered at Vista
00:31:24 before Windows 7 came out.
00:31:26 I guess Microsoft wanted to come out with a campaign
00:31:28 to convince people that Vista didn't suck that much.
00:31:30 And from what I've heard from tech people,
00:31:32 I heard it was mostly like a hardware issue
00:31:34 on the part of Gateway and Walmart,
00:31:36 but I don't know.
00:31:37 But Microsoft had these ads where they had real-life
00:31:39 non-actors come in
00:31:41 to try out the new,
00:31:43 secretly fake Windows operating system
00:31:45 known as Windows Mojave.
00:31:47 And they interviewed people asking them
00:31:49 what they thought of Vista,
00:31:50 and everyone said, oh, Vista sucks.
00:31:52 Well, I'm a normal dumb person.
00:31:54 I think this sucks.
00:31:55 Okay, now let's try Windows Mojave.
00:31:57 And they tried it, and like, this is great.
00:31:59 I used it for five minutes, and I think it's really great.
00:32:01 I'm an unpaid non-actor person, real-life guy.
00:32:04 How much do you like Windows Mojave?
00:32:06 I love it.
00:32:07 Well, guess what?
00:32:08 Windows Mojave is Windows Vista
00:32:10 with a different name on top.
00:32:12 Oh, my God.
00:32:13 She was so wrong.
00:32:15 It's like, Windows Vista, you're an idiot.
00:32:17 Buy our products.
00:32:19 Like, who the heck exactly convinced?
00:32:21 Oh, that's great.
00:32:22 Vista, you're an idiot.
00:32:24 So, like, they pour it.
00:32:25 So, like, they pour it.
00:32:26 Oh, my God.
00:32:27 So, like, they pour it.
00:32:28 That's the meaning.
00:32:29 It doesn't say that.
00:32:30 Go on, Ben.
00:32:31 That's the meaning of it.
00:32:32 Like, they poured two...
00:32:33 Yeah.
00:32:34 They poured two tall, cool, refreshing glasses
00:32:37 of Windows Cola, and you drank one of each,
00:32:40 and then they asked you which one tasted better,
00:32:42 and they said, oh, this one.
00:32:43 Yeah.
00:32:44 This Cola is Mojave.
00:32:45 That is, like, a proven fact, though.
00:32:48 Like, people have certain biases.
00:32:50 There's a great episode of Penn and Teller's bullshit
00:32:54 where they're talking about bottled water,
00:32:58 and they go to a fancy restaurant,
00:33:00 and they have this guy be, like, the water steward,
00:33:03 and he, like, brings out all these different samples
00:33:05 of bottled water and, like, boxy bottles
00:33:08 and circular bottles and all these fancy bottles,
00:33:11 and, like, he tells them, oh, this is from the mountains
00:33:14 of the Himalayas, this is from such and such,
00:33:16 this is from such and such.
00:33:17 They drink it, and it's like, oh, that's got a very...
00:33:19 it's got sort of a metallic aftertaste.
00:33:21 Ooh, that's kind of minty, you know,
00:33:23 they're, like, making all these comments,
00:33:24 and then they just, they take them around to the back
00:33:27 where they've got Teller's just there
00:33:30 with a garden hose pouring water into all these fucking bottles.
00:33:34 They did that with food, too.
00:33:36 Fantastic.
00:33:37 They brought this back into a restaurant,
00:33:38 and they started serving them, like, Taco Bell
00:33:40 and, like, Walmart 99-cent shit,
00:33:42 and the same guy came out and, like,
00:33:45 trying to make it look all fancy,
00:33:47 and then tell them it was, like, this really expensive shit,
00:33:50 and they were all like, this is fantastic.
00:33:52 And, you know...
00:33:53 Presentation matters a lot.
00:33:55 True, true.
00:33:56 That reminds me of the one issue
00:33:58 in Biggest Problem in the Universe.
00:34:00 Most of the time I agreed with Dick,
00:34:02 but the one thing that I was totally on Maddox's side about
00:34:05 was his thing about expensive steak.
00:34:07 Oh, yeah.
00:34:08 Yeah, expensive steak.
00:34:09 Dick Masterson swears that, like,
00:34:12 paying, like, $60 for a steak is, like...
00:34:14 I remember that.
00:34:15 It's just not comparable to whatever...
00:34:18 Or, like, $100 for a steak.
00:34:19 You know, Maddox kind of conceded.
00:34:21 He swears that there's some real tangible difference
00:34:24 by a really expensive steak.
00:34:25 There is. There is.
00:34:27 I've...
00:34:28 I mean, like, I've been wind and dined
00:34:32 at fancy restaurants as a member of the press,
00:34:34 and believe me when I say
00:34:36 that a really succulent cut of steak
00:34:38 that's prepared well is a lot better
00:34:40 than what you're gonna get.
00:34:41 Well, hang on.
00:34:42 How much of that is in the prepared part?
00:34:44 You know, how much of that comes into the preparation
00:34:46 and the presentation and the tenderizing
00:34:48 and all that stuff?
00:34:49 I think, like, 50%.
00:34:50 But, I mean, again,
00:34:52 that's what you're paying for at a fancy restaurant
00:34:54 is a chef who knows how to do that well
00:34:56 in addition to great ingredients.
00:34:59 But there's only...
00:35:00 There's only so good a steak can be.
00:35:02 Right? There's gotta be some point in which
00:35:04 paying more for a steak can no longer...
00:35:06 Oh, yeah.
00:35:07 I'm just saying, I went to the House of Prime Rib
00:35:10 in San Francisco,
00:35:11 which is like an $80 plate restaurant
00:35:14 where they only serve prime rib,
00:35:15 and I fucking came in my pants.
00:35:17 I came in my pants
00:35:19 in front of business people.
00:35:21 In front of God, Jesus, and the bear,
00:35:23 he came in his pants.
00:35:24 I came in my pants.
00:35:26 It was delicious.
00:35:27 It's one of the...
00:35:29 There was an...
00:35:30 There reminds me of an incredible drill tweet
00:35:32 from like a week ago,
00:35:33 where he says, like, yeah,
00:35:35 a pamphlet labeled MRA shit
00:35:38 comes tumbling out of my pocket
00:35:40 during my weekly Wild Wings J.O. session,
00:35:43 costing me the yo-play deal.
00:35:48 Drill's a legend, man.
00:35:49 Shout out to Drill.
00:35:51 I fucking love Drill so much.
00:35:53 Holy shit.
00:35:54 We're way off topic, man.
00:35:56 Yeah, we've gotten drastically off topic.
00:35:59 We can kind of bring the idea here
00:36:02 back to our witty banter topic,
00:36:04 which was, in fact, our topic,
00:36:06 in that it's...
00:36:07 The Wild Wings J.O. session.
00:36:09 It's not about...
00:36:10 You can't just dress up fancy shit.
00:36:12 Like, no matter how good
00:36:14 or how much action is going on in your movie...
00:36:16 Nice, silky smooth segue.
00:36:18 Yeah, thank you.
00:36:20 No matter how many billions you've spent
00:36:22 on making your scene look professional,
00:36:24 like in all your Avengers shit,
00:36:26 it's not going to make a lick of difference.
00:36:28 It's not going to impress people who actually care
00:36:30 about good dialogue and good characters.
00:36:32 Let me dial back to a specific example.
00:36:35 This was the thing that I think I was thinking of
00:36:37 when I suggested this topic.
00:36:39 And it's a webcomic that I don't hate it,
00:36:42 but I definitely don't like it either.
00:36:44 Well, I mean, you hate it because it's not yours.
00:36:47 It's taken away from your market share.
00:36:49 That's true.
00:36:50 That's absolutely true.
00:36:52 But...
00:36:53 Alright, so it's called Dumbing of Age,
00:36:55 and it's like a daily...
00:36:57 Yeah?
00:36:58 Okay, I guess you got an opinion.
00:37:00 It's like a daily gag strip,
00:37:04 but it also tells a semi-serious dramatic story
00:37:07 about a bunch of college freshmen fucking around.
00:37:10 I don't know.
00:37:11 It's fine and all,
00:37:13 but I really think that the structure of it
00:37:16 takes away from it because it's a dramatic story,
00:37:19 but it's told as these daily gags.
00:37:21 And so every...
00:37:23 Not everyone, but most of the beats
00:37:25 have to end with the joke.
00:37:27 So these characters' dramatic lives
00:37:29 are just punctuated by an endless series
00:37:32 of goofy gags
00:37:34 and snarky comebacks.
00:37:36 Yes, and one line is...
00:37:38 I'm looking at one right now
00:37:40 where the religious girl is talking to her gay friend
00:37:43 and she's just had a boyfriend
00:37:45 because he's dating her as a beard, whatever,
00:37:47 and she's realized that she can't keep doing this to him.
00:37:50 And she's like,
00:37:51 no, we've got to stop this.
00:37:52 And she says,
00:37:53 it's not right for us to be together.
00:37:55 You got to go back where you belong now
00:37:57 with your own kind.
00:37:58 Get out of here.
00:37:59 I don't need you anymore.
00:38:00 And then the boyfriend kind of
00:38:02 does a snarky expression and goes,
00:38:04 is that from Harry and the Henderson's?
00:38:06 Turns out this dramatic scene
00:38:08 is being undercut by some
00:38:10 goofy old movie reference
00:38:12 where he's got to let his pet dog
00:38:14 go for a while or something.
00:38:16 And I don't like it when this happens.
00:38:19 I think it is a disservice.
00:38:21 I'm pretty sure that they toss a gag
00:38:23 into that within two comics
00:38:26 of the scene where one of the characters
00:38:28 almost gets raped.
00:38:30 They do.
00:38:31 They have all these gag.
00:38:33 And a character will say something snarky
00:38:35 and nasty at the end of a panel,
00:38:38 but it doesn't necessarily disrupt the story.
00:38:41 You would expect someone to have
00:38:43 some reaction or response,
00:38:45 but usually the next strip just starts up
00:38:47 without any mention of it.
00:38:49 Not all the time, but a lot of the time.
00:38:51 This guy also does that fucking Tumblr thing
00:38:54 where every single character he disagrees with
00:38:56 is painted as basically Satan.
00:39:00 There's some of that.
00:39:02 I've been keeping up with it.
00:39:04 I don't know why.
00:39:05 I don't know why.
00:39:07 You know how you get into a habit of
00:39:09 checking back with a webcomic after a while
00:39:11 and you just do it instinctually?
00:39:13 When you've read so much of it,
00:39:16 you can't stop reading it.
00:39:18 There's this character now
00:39:20 who's hyper religious
00:39:22 and she's trying to run
00:39:24 the trans girl
00:39:27 who lives in their dorm out of the dorm
00:39:30 by blackmailing the super,
00:39:33 which of course involves a lot of stupid
00:39:35 Mickey Mouse gags and shit.
00:39:40 She's the religious stand-in
00:39:45 compared to the other character
00:39:47 who it's Joyce who's heavily implied
00:39:50 is completely losing all of her faith in God
00:39:53 because her best friend's gay.
00:39:55 Yeah, that's her arc, right?
00:39:57 Her arc is she's losing her faith
00:39:59 and becoming a better person as a result.
00:40:01 Because she's not religious anymore.
00:40:07 It's so heavy-handed.
00:40:09 Part of the problem
00:40:11 is that this comic is from the guy
00:40:13 who wrote Short Pact.
00:40:15 Yeah, he does a lot.
00:40:17 He's very prolific.
00:40:19 He's very prolific,
00:40:21 and all of his comics involve the same characters
00:40:23 in different sort of situations
00:40:25 because he's never come up with a new character
00:40:27 in like 15 fucking years.
00:40:29 Yeah, that's weird.
00:40:31 It's weird, it's like the same characters later
00:40:33 after they've gotten married and had a kid or whatever.
00:40:35 Yeah, and his dialogue
00:40:37 isn't even good?
00:40:39 It's not.
00:40:41 It's not.
00:40:43 But he's really trying to be clever
00:40:45 and get off gags.
00:40:47 He makes like,
00:40:49 okay, there was one I just read where
00:40:51 a girl at a social-
00:40:53 she's at church and she tears off her dress
00:40:55 and she goes, was that a Taraway dress?
00:40:57 And she replies,
00:40:59 is a Tara what you say?
00:41:01 That's a Simpsons joke.
00:41:03 That is just a straight up fucking ripped off from Homer Simpson.
00:41:05 Yo, I'm looking at that comic right now, Ben,
00:41:07 and it's pretty hot. That's all I've got to say about it.
00:41:09 Oh, he draws porn.
00:41:11 He draws porn.
00:41:13 He draws his own characters.
00:41:15 He canonically draws porn scenes.
00:41:17 Well, so does the greatest comic artist of all time,
00:41:19 Christian Westerchild, but we don't have that
00:41:21 against him to do it.
00:41:23 No, but this is bad porn.
00:41:25 In the comic itself,
00:41:27 characters will hook up and it'll skip to the next day,
00:41:29 but then he'll go and actually draw the section
00:41:31 and post it on Slipshine.com.
00:41:33 You can go to Slipshine.com
00:41:35 and buy that comic right now.
00:41:37 Things are gonna get slippery.
00:41:39 But the best thing about those
00:41:41 the best thing
00:41:43 about those comics
00:41:45 is when fucking
00:41:47 4chan gets a hold of them
00:41:49 and edits them together.
00:41:51 Oh, yeah, of course.
00:41:53 Oh, my God.
00:41:55 You see, that's where the magic comes in.
00:41:57 I don't want to get into a whole thing about this,
00:41:59 but I have really strong
00:42:01 but conflicted feelings
00:42:03 about creators like that who draw porn
00:42:05 of their own creations like that.
00:42:07 Really?
00:42:09 It really ties me up in knots.
00:42:11 I know I would.
00:42:13 I really hate it, but I really
00:42:15 Yeah, we know you would.
00:42:17 I really feel weird about it.
00:42:19 Is that so?
00:42:21 You know, webcomics.
00:42:23 But I also feel bad for feeling weird about it.
00:42:25 Webcomics.
00:42:27 I know a webcomic
00:42:29 that does not have snarky witty dialogue
00:42:31 is Cucumber Quest,
00:42:33 the only webcomic I've ever read
00:42:35 and it's still going
00:42:37 and all the characters
00:42:39 except for the main character
00:42:41 are kind of dumb
00:42:43 or not self-aware
00:42:45 or really impulsive and irrational
00:42:47 in hilarious ways.
00:42:49 The main character plays the straight man
00:42:51 to all of them, but he's not that strong-willed
00:42:53 so he just gets swept away by all of them
00:42:55 but he's always trying
00:42:57 to be like, wait, come on, that's a totally stupid decision.
00:42:59 No!
00:43:01 And it's hilarious.
00:43:03 The titular cucumber.
00:43:05 It's very relatable to any situation
00:43:07 you've been in in your life
00:43:09 when you were making a stupid decision
00:43:11 and no one was listening to you
00:43:13 but hey, it goes deeper than that
00:43:15 because as the series has been going on
00:43:17 it's been starting to come into focus
00:43:19 it's starting to be clear
00:43:21 that all the impulsive actions
00:43:23 of all the characters turns out to be
00:43:25 accidentally or unintentionally
00:43:27 more along the lines of what you actually
00:43:29 the point is he's not all right
00:43:31 it turns out that the actions that everyone has been taking
00:43:33 has a lot more
00:43:35 logic behind it than it may seem
00:43:37 at first and it's a nice balance
00:43:39 of, oh man
00:43:41 I was trying to say that
00:43:43 I was trying to get this point in for like 20 minutes
00:43:45 and the longer it sits in my mind
00:43:47 the more inarticulate it gets
00:43:49 my dialogue is not witty at all
00:43:51 so I think what the show
00:43:53 is what the comic is alluding to
00:43:55 is that the rational
00:43:57 thinking of the main character
00:43:59 in combination with the more
00:44:01 impulsive actions of all the other characters
00:44:03 put together
00:44:05 well whatever
00:44:07 the podcast listeners are going to be able to hear
00:44:09 in the podcast I'll be able to hear them
00:44:11 right
00:44:13 so it seems like
00:44:15 it's going to be the rational thinking of the main character
00:44:17 in tandem
00:44:19 with the more impulsive thinking of all the other characters
00:44:21 is going to lead the story
00:44:23 to a successful conclusion
00:44:25 and that's the kind of more humble
00:44:27 writing that I'm a fan of
00:44:29 like in the Lego movie where it has all of these creative characters
00:44:31 the ones you can just build
00:44:33 anything against the instructions
00:44:35 and at first you're like oh these are obviously the savants
00:44:37 they're the only people who can break
00:44:39 the system and be cool and awesome
00:44:41 and obviously all the people writing the movie
00:44:43 and making the movie are all fancy themselves
00:44:45 as the creative types but
00:44:47 toward the end it starts to suggest
00:44:49 that just being a wild creative person
00:44:51 isn't very good you got to be more
00:44:53 rational than that
00:44:55 and so the movie shows you got to have both
00:44:57 types it's a writer
00:44:59 sitting down writing a story
00:45:01 about how they're not the answer
00:45:03 and the solution to everyone's problems
00:45:05 isn't that interesting
00:45:07 now that is with
00:45:09 by do say so myself
00:45:11 wait what
00:45:13 what movie was that?
00:45:15 the Lego movie
00:45:17 the Lego movie yeah
00:45:19 cool
00:45:21 yeah go on Ben
00:45:23 okay
00:45:25 well first let me just make a side note
00:45:27 that control alt delete
00:45:29 is the ultimate webcomic
00:45:31 full of snarky dial
00:45:33 and two clever by half
00:45:35 bullshit
00:45:37 by the way
00:45:39 is also the sound of that face that they all make
00:45:41 that's true
00:45:43 that's totally true
00:45:45 the only one that I feel is a little bit more
00:45:47 of a shame is
00:45:49 XKCD which is inundated with clever
00:45:51 bullshit that I hate
00:45:53 and kind of ruins I can't read it much
00:45:55 anymore
00:45:57 sometimes the tone of XKCD
00:45:59 is really off
00:46:01 but sometimes it's legitimately clever
00:46:03 it lacks good punchlines
00:46:05 it can be a really clever comic
00:46:07 I love the math stuff
00:46:09 I much prefer Saturday morning breakfast cereal
00:46:11 and
00:46:13 I hate Saturday morning breakfast cereal
00:46:15 I hate cannot stand that
00:46:17 that's a fight for another day
00:46:19 I know I'm in the minority
00:46:21 that's a fight for another day
00:46:23 and I really liked amazing
00:46:25 the power powers in gun show
00:46:27 before they stopped doing things
00:46:29 gun show is great
00:46:31 what was I talking about before you mentioned
00:46:33 XKCD
00:46:35 XKCD can be funny
00:46:37 but I don't think the dialogue is ever funny
00:46:39 I don't think the dialogue itself
00:46:41 is ever clever in a good way
00:46:43 I agree
00:46:45 the dialogue is never amazing
00:46:47 it's got really
00:46:49 snarky sometimes
00:46:51 I'm looking at some of control alt delete
00:46:53 and I'm immediately remembering
00:46:55 why I don't read any webcomics
00:46:57 it's because
00:46:59 you run out of jokes immediately
00:47:01 I tried to do a webcomic back when I was 16
00:47:03 I was going to do it
00:47:05 twice a week
00:47:07 I ran out of jokes in a week and a half
00:47:09 and I gave up like all webcomic artists should
00:47:13 just resort to random violence
00:47:15 I tried two webcomics
00:47:17 back in the day
00:47:19 but those more fell apart
00:47:21 because art is hard
00:47:23 and finding artists to do shit for you is hard
00:47:27 yeah
00:47:29 I
00:47:31 I wrote some good dialogue
00:47:33 I'm just going to say I wrote some pretty good dialogue
00:47:35 oh sure
00:47:37 maybe
00:47:39 statistically someone had to
00:47:43 I actually write a lot of stuff
00:47:45 I've got strong opinions
00:47:47 on the flip side of this
00:47:49 which is a whole bunch of people
00:47:51 complain whenever characters
00:47:53 are witty in anything
00:47:55 and they're like oh that's not realistic
00:47:57 and what they seem to want is
00:47:59 what we're doing now
00:48:01 the back and forth where everybody's
00:48:03 stumbling over their words and sounding like idiots
00:48:05 um
00:48:07 and that's
00:48:09 let me defend that position
00:48:11 because if characters are so
00:48:13 clever and so witty and have such great
00:48:15 good liners that it's
00:48:17 realistic and strains credulity
00:48:19 I think that's bad
00:48:21 I think that's bad too
00:48:23 witty dialogue in real life
00:48:25 I think that can be a legitimate
00:48:27 in real life battles
00:48:29 real life deathifying situations
00:48:31 can sometimes have witty dialogue
00:48:33 there was some sergeant or whoever who said
00:48:35 alright man there's two types of men
00:48:37 on this battlefield those who are dead
00:48:39 and those who are going to be move out
00:48:41 and that was spoken on Normandy
00:48:43 as it was going on
00:48:45 there was a couple of them who got a good chuckle
00:48:47 right before they got shot
00:48:49 right before they got a bullet to the neck
00:48:51 I don't think
00:48:53 that realism
00:48:55 is really ever
00:48:57 the goal
00:48:59 in creating a work of fiction
00:49:01 the goal is verisimilitude
00:49:03 the goal is believability
00:49:05 not realism
00:49:07 and
00:49:09 to an extent
00:49:11 if they're too witty that takes away
00:49:13 from it but to the same extent
00:49:15 if people are stumbling over their words
00:49:17 and using lots of filler words that sounds awkward
00:49:19 that's not something people want to watch
00:49:21 and that sounds fake in its own way
00:49:23 like a real
00:49:25 a real conversation
00:49:27 not improvised like somebody who
00:49:29 took all of this dialogue
00:49:31 and made people like all of what we're saying right now
00:49:33 somebody who took that and made somebody
00:49:35 rehearse it and deliver it
00:49:37 that would sound more fake
00:49:39 than if they cut out all of the fluff bits
00:49:41 and only
00:49:43 hit the salient points
00:49:45 and didn't have us dancing around the same points over and over again
00:49:47 and just had us
00:49:49 get to what we wanted to say
00:49:51 on the subject of
00:49:53 like you said, not going for realism
00:49:55 necessarily but going for believability
00:49:57 I agree with that and I like that
00:49:59 and I think that Tyrion and Game of Thrones
00:50:01 is a really great example
00:50:03 like his comebacks and stuff
00:50:05 are maybe
00:50:07 unrealistically good sometimes
00:50:09 but it's okay when he does it because everyone else
00:50:11 because he's
00:50:13 all the times he does stuff like that
00:50:15 establish him as being generally smarter
00:50:17 than the people around him
00:50:19 so when he is making one-liners
00:50:21 and being like too clever by half
00:50:23 it's kind of okay because you know
00:50:25 that he is this like larger than life
00:50:27 smarter than the people around him
00:50:29 dude
00:50:31 so even though it's not necessarily realistic when he does it
00:50:33 it works
00:50:35 that's what I have to say about that
00:50:37 haha
00:50:39 I was just reading some of these
00:50:41 SMBC comics
00:50:43 and noticing
00:50:45 the thing about SMBC is that
00:50:47 it's all the same
00:50:49 it all feels like the same joke
00:50:51 it's all some like
00:50:53 it's some science fiction
00:50:55 or like economic or scientific
00:50:57 economic was a lot of him yeah
00:50:59 his social concept
00:51:01 and then he just kind of presents it
00:51:03 and has like a kid
00:51:05 be like but dad
00:51:07 why don't we just you know
00:51:09 economic thing and the dad is like
00:51:11 no son because
00:51:13 you know other economic thing
00:51:15 take into its logical extreme
00:51:17 that's exactly the one I just read
00:51:19 since he became a dad
00:51:21 that's certainly more and more true
00:51:23 like he's
00:51:25 my issue is not that it's all about dads
00:51:27 and their kids it's just that
00:51:29 they all have the same like
00:51:31 cadence
00:51:33 wish fulfillment stuff for him though
00:51:35 that's like here's how I'd fuck with my kid
00:51:37 you know
00:51:39 if this situation came out
00:51:41 oh yeah every father just wants to fuck his kid
00:51:43 I'm with you brother
00:51:45 that's not what he said
00:51:47 haha
00:51:49 fuck god damn it
00:51:51 on
00:51:53 okay on the subject
00:51:55 of witty banter and someone getting off
00:51:57 one liners
00:51:59 I heard like a brief snippet of an interview
00:52:01 with Steven Fry the other day
00:52:03 and someone asked him
00:52:05 about the differences between
00:52:07 British comedy and American comedy
00:52:09 and what he said was interesting
00:52:11 and I'm gonna try and remember it
00:52:13 and I hope I don't completely butcher it
00:52:15 I don't think I remember it exactly but I'll try
00:52:17 and he said like American comedy
00:52:19 is very
00:52:21 focused on like the comedian is
00:52:23 like the hero and the comedian is smarter
00:52:25 than everyone else
00:52:27 and like you know kind of
00:52:29 gives them up for the fools that they are
00:52:31 whereas the British
00:52:33 comedian is the fool
00:52:35 and like life just shits on him
00:52:37 so interesting that is
00:52:39 yeah I think
00:52:41 I'm gonna try the example
00:52:43 I think the example he gave was like
00:52:45 if someone is playing a guitar
00:52:47 badly an American comic
00:52:49 might come and like smash the guitar
00:52:51 and everyone would go haha that's what I wanted
00:52:53 to do
00:52:55 he says what we're all thinking or whatever
00:52:57 the comedian would be the guitar player
00:52:59 who gets his guitar smashed
00:53:01 by some dick
00:53:03 yeah
00:53:05 so there's a thing I guess maybe
00:53:07 the witty banter
00:53:09 that irks me so much
00:53:11 is kind of an American thing
00:53:13 or like an America centric thing
00:53:15 could be it does feel that way
00:53:17 now that you mention it
00:53:19 did someone just leave
00:53:21 his audio is fucking up so he's
00:53:23 oh well I guess that's
00:53:25 is it as good a time as any to end?
00:53:27 probably
00:53:29 we've only been going for like 50 minutes
00:53:31 but I'm pretty comfortable with that
00:53:33 I will say before we close out
00:53:35 despite all of that
00:53:37 everything that we just said
00:53:39 there are times when I enjoy
00:53:41 and list witty banter as a guilty pleasure
00:53:43 sometimes
00:53:45 why don't you give some examples
00:53:47 of witty banter done
00:53:49 you know that's a good idea
00:53:51 I've been complaining about the concept a lot
00:53:53 although I acknowledge that it can be done well
00:53:55 well how about like anything
00:53:57 in the Avengers movies if you like those
00:53:59 I fucking love the entire MCU
00:54:01 I like Joss Whedon's writing
00:54:03 the Avengers is fun
00:54:05 that's the whole thing
00:54:07 I can recognize that it's stupid
00:54:09 but in the moment it's just like
00:54:11 I like it
00:54:13 I'm not a big fan
00:54:15 I haven't seen any of the Avengers movies
00:54:17 but I imagine people don't really watch them
00:54:19 for like intense character
00:54:21 development or stuff like that
00:54:23 I don't know
00:54:25 they watch the side movies
00:54:27 for that they watch the Avengers
00:54:29 for the big third act
00:54:31 climax to every single
00:54:33 other movie in the entire
00:54:35 franchise
00:54:37 that's what the crossover movies are
00:54:39 so there's no character development in those
00:54:41 there can't be
00:54:43 and it may still be guilty
00:54:45 of this
00:54:47 it may still be guilty of just making all the characters witty
00:54:49 for the sake of it but nobody seems to really give a shit
00:54:51 so you know at the end of the day
00:54:53 what really matters is if people are enjoying themselves
00:54:55 I mean
00:54:57 you know in a monetary sense so
00:54:59 fuck it
00:55:01 wait enjoying themselves in a monetary sense
00:55:03 no no they're enjoying themselves and
00:55:05 like the people enjoy the movie
00:55:07 so they're willing to go see it and they don't care
00:55:09 if the characters are consistent or any of that
00:55:11 whatever
00:55:13 I think that truly witty
00:55:15 not quote unquote witty
00:55:17 banter or dialogue
00:55:19 can only happen
00:55:21 when it's occurring in a way that's consistent
00:55:23 with like strong character
00:55:25 development and characterization
00:55:27 and if it's like
00:55:29 a witty line that's just
00:55:31 in there to be witty and doesn't
00:55:33 serve the purpose of the narrative
00:55:35 or the character or whatever
00:55:37 is bad it doesn't matter how witty it is
00:55:39 it's bad and it shouldn't be there
00:55:41 if it doesn't mesh
00:55:43 with everything else that should be going on in the scene
00:55:45 yeah like something like where
00:55:47 Sheldon walks up to Penny's door and goes
00:55:49 knock knock knock Penny
00:55:51 she opens door and she is a Penny
00:55:53 that's witty dialogue
00:55:55 that's real witty
00:55:57 that's the kind of thing I want to see
00:55:59 alright anyone have anything else
00:56:01 or shall we end it now
00:56:03 let's end it now
00:56:07 okay everybody
00:56:09 thanks for watching we'll be back next week
00:56:11 hope you enjoyed we'll see you later

00:57:03 I'm supposed to
00:57:05 be making money

00:57:09 supposed to be creating
00:57:11 creating
00:57:13 funny things
00:57:15 that the people
00:57:17 gladly will pay
00:57:19 for artistic
00:57:21 genius that's what
00:57:23 they came for
