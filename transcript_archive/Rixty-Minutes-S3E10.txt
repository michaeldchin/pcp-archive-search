00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of Rick's D Minutes. We're back with the finale
00:00:05 of season 3, episode 10, the Rick Churri and Morty date. The last episode of Rick's D Minutes
00:00:10 for the foreseeable future. Yeah, possibly for years. Could be years until the next one.
00:00:15 Unless we decide to like go back and do the other seasons at some point. Which we could
00:00:19 do. Feeling masochistic. Maybe as like a batch we could do the season or something. But in
00:00:24 any case. It could be more interesting because those ones already have commentary and stuff
00:00:28 that we could go through. Right. Which I have not watched any of but would very much like
00:00:31 to based on what you've told me about them. They're really fun. They're worth watching.
00:00:35 But anyway. Let's get into it. So, Rick Churri and Morty date. Oh, I'm Digibro by the way.
00:00:42 Oh, that's right. I can't use Kyver. There you go. Yeah. And yeah, this is the season finale.
00:00:50 Kind of sprung on me out of nowhere because for some reason previously on Wikipedia it had
00:00:56 suggested that this would be a 13 episode season. So, I really thought they were like
00:01:01 going all out and making it a longer one. And considering how much
00:01:05 plot development happened this season, it felt like that would be the case.
00:01:09 Yes. But then suddenly it was just, oh, episode 10. That's the last one. It's just fucking over.
00:01:13 Did you feel, I don't remember where I read this. But somewhere I think I read that
00:01:20 Justin Royland specifically said like, yeah, we were supposed to do 13. It got shrunk down to 10.
00:01:24 Sorry about that. Next time we'll try to do better. If that's the case. I have the feeling
00:01:32 that there were a lot of production mishaps on this season. And that that contributes a lot
00:01:38 to why it took so fucking long to make. Because there was a definite sensation I had from this
00:01:44 episode. And this is skipping right to the end. But the last scene sort of restores things
00:01:52 to normal. Like they were in season one sort of gets us back to the status quo.
00:01:58 And Beth says like outright, it's basically going to be like season one except more streamlined
00:02:03 from now on. Indeed. And I couldn't help but think that what happened here, like what happened with
00:02:09 this whole season was that by the end of season two, they'd written themselves into this place
00:02:14 where it's like we are now going to do a continuous narrative with this show. Right.
00:02:18 And I think maybe in the process of trying to hash out what that continuous narrative is,
00:02:23 it became apparent that this was not a good idea or that they didn't know how or that there just
00:02:29 wasn't a way. And so they went, yeah, let's let's just address all the open ended things
00:02:37 this season and then just kind of wrap back into something normal that we can continue with,
00:02:45 you know, that's how it felt to me. I would be inclined to agree. And especially the whole
00:02:51 ending scene feels extremely tacked on to the end of this. I mean, what's fascinating to me
00:02:57 about this episode, correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like this is the first episode of
00:03:01 Rick and Morty where the B plot has been a thousand times better than the A plot. And it was it was
00:03:08 so unusual for the show to spend so much time on this, this whole like presidential like
00:03:14 breakup, you know, like bad feelings thing. And then like, and then we get to the thing that
00:03:20 actually matters. Like last episode, we were like, Oh man, will they ever address will we ever see
00:03:25 an addressing happened in this episode and we're past it. It's done. The questions are answered in
00:03:31 the trash. It goes amazing and not in a good way. I kind of feel, yeah, it's a weird feeling.
00:03:40 I can easily imagine the writers with this story seeing it kind of spiraling out of control and
00:03:47 getting to because like, if you look back at what Rick and Morty was, what the successful formula
00:03:52 was like season one was not great because it had an ongoing plot. It had little tidbits of like
00:03:58 emotional stuff that carries over. Like, you know, in one episode, they ditched their universe in
00:04:04 another episode, it's confirmed that they are still in the ditched universe. There is a continuity.
00:04:09 Bro, that's abnormal in some way. And then by the time we get to Rick has overthrown the government
00:04:17 of the entire cosmos. And like, there's all this background shit going on. And now Beth,
00:04:22 what if she goes and has her own adventure? And I have the feeling someone had to go like,
00:04:26 we can't write about Beth and her adventures because this is going to get so unfocused.
00:04:31 Oh, they fucked up so bad. The correct way to handle that we already addressed. At least I
00:04:37 think we did last episode. You just go have her do her adventures. And then like in a season or two
00:04:42 or whatever, you can have an episode about that Beth. And then it blinds everyone. We're like, oh
00:04:47 my God, we totally forgot about that. But this has been the fake bet the whole time. This recontextualizes
00:04:53 everything I thought. Like everyone would have loved that. It would have been super cool. But
00:04:56 they're just like, no, too much work. We can't do all that. We just want to address it. But yeah,
00:04:59 I mean, but then if they leave that open thread, then it's just one more thing they got to worry.
00:05:03 I guess there was something cheap about like, and I'm not celebrating that they did this
00:05:08 necessarily. But I couldn't help but feel like the ending of this season was their way of going,
00:05:15 just put it all back to normal. I don't want to do this anymore. You know, fuck, what have we done?
00:05:21 And just seeing that, you know, that several episodes have commented on the slowness of the
00:05:26 season coming out, the fact like the conflicts and getting it made, like it's pretty clear that
00:05:33 Dan and Justin have, I've only been picking up like random things like tertiary knowledge about
00:05:39 this. But people have been saying like that they've been addressing a lot of issues like apparently
00:05:46 Dan Harmon hated the episode we hated. The vindicators. That's right. Yeah, the vindicators.
00:05:50 And good man. He's got good taste, obviously. Yeah. And so it makes me think, man, it must have
00:05:56 just been fucking chaos putting the season together. Like I'm thinking that they hit
00:06:03 simultaneously the most ambition they wanted to have with the show and the least they could
00:06:09 actually do with the show at the same time. You know, that's the kind of feeling I'm getting.
00:06:14 But this is all speculation. And it's interesting because this show has absolutely blown up this
00:06:19 season. This has been the season post season two. I mean, it was a long time after post season two
00:06:24 into this, but now people are really paying attention to the show just in time for it to
00:06:29 stumble a little bit, stumble along its way. Not completely, obviously. Some of these episodes
00:06:33 were fantastic. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's unavoidable. But I don't know. Is this still
00:06:40 going to happen? You think as the show clearly is taking on an even bigger role than it had
00:06:45 previously. The funny thing about Rick and Morty, and this was already the case in season two,
00:06:50 is it's too big for itself. Yeah. Like it's too successful because it's on fucking adult swim.
00:06:57 Right. Like it's never going to be a like high budget production. It's always going to be like
00:07:01 this weird off kilter passion project. And the fact that it has this kind of attention is kind of
00:07:07 like strange. It's almost like with my little pony friendship is magic, a show we're both very
00:07:13 familiar with where the show suddenly erupts in popularity right around the time that the actual
00:07:21 lead writer is leaving because like it sucks to work on the show. And then you get this weird,
00:07:27 muddied storyline and production where as the show is getting more popular, it's also getting
00:07:33 worse. And I feel like we're seeing something similar here. I don't even necessarily think
00:07:40 the season is worse, but like there's clearly been issues with the production where like the
00:07:45 popularity of the show is taking people from the show and leaving them not able to actually
00:07:52 make the show that will satisfy its new, huge audience. That's my question. Do you think we'll
00:07:58 finally see a stoppage of the leak of talent from Rick and Morty because it's so popular now?
00:08:04 Will they finally recognize like, okay, that's it. Does it make more money by being more popular?
00:08:08 That's a good question. Is adult swim like able to pay these people enough to keep them, you know?
00:08:13 How have they made all these like spin off like games and shit and all these like shorts and
00:08:18 these 3D, you know, whatever, like all the spin off stuff that's come from Rick and Morty. How the
00:08:24 fuck was it all financed and like where those just if all those make money, then like, okay,
00:08:29 maybe they can pay for themselves. But how do they get people on these projects to make these?
00:08:34 I don't know. I guess it's all part of the zeitgeist that's carried Rick and Morty to the
00:08:39 popularity set now. And I'll say I'm going to, since we're talking about the meta of the season
00:08:45 anyways, to talk about the content of this episode. For the most part, yeah. And I don't hate this
00:08:51 episode. I thought it was fine, but like it's not the one that has the most deep shit to talk about.
00:08:57 Season three as a whole. Compared to the last season finale, like, Jesus Christ.
00:09:01 I almost felt like this one was deliberately retarded. I got a little bit. Like just because
00:09:08 it was so like, so dumb with the president thing, like, like going above and beyond to make the
00:09:15 president this petty idiotic character and to focus so much on this dumb story almost felt like
00:09:20 they were deliberately making sure, you know, like, okay, we're not doing that again. Season two
00:09:26 finale was a fluke. That's not where this is going. We're restoring normalcy. We're going back to
00:09:31 sitcom roots, you know, who's felt like a sitcom episode. Like this episode, in some ways, it felt
00:09:39 almost family guy-esque to me. Yeah. Yeah, totally. But then to be more kind to it, I would compare
00:09:46 it to an episode of the Venture Brothers, like just that kind of sense of irreverence. But while,
00:09:52 you know, applying the unique brand of this show to a sort of classic scenario, like working for
00:09:58 the president, you know, which feels like an old school sitcom premise almost. But yeah, it's
00:10:06 and I think it's a goofy fun time. I enjoyed what I got, but it definitely was weird to see this as
00:10:12 the season finale. Well, that's the whole thing. I really feel I have no way of knowing this is
00:10:17 true enough. But I really think this is just like one of the episodes, considering we know so much
00:10:21 about how many problems that we're just getting this made. And the, you know, we, I wish I had
00:10:27 actually looked this up, but I know somewhere, Justin Rowland said, like, yeah, they fucked up
00:10:31 and they couldn't make as many episodes as they wanted to. I really feel like this was just going
00:10:35 to be an episode in the series. But then they got to the crunch time and they're like, oh, fuck,
00:10:39 we need to make this the season finale. And then they, like they either slapped on the Beth plot
00:10:44 into this and the whole ending thing where they wrapped all that shit up. That's what it feels
00:10:48 like to me. But that's not to say that I didn't enjoy the president stuff, because I did. It was
00:10:55 good and fun. I just the whole time I was sitting here knowing this was the season finale and was
00:10:59 like, okay, ready to be impressed. Here I am sitting here looking for that good shit. Oh,
00:11:04 there's Beth things going on. Something interesting is going to happen with that. And it did. The
00:11:08 Beth plot was interesting. But like so much more time was devoted to the president stuff.
00:11:13 And hey, the fight, the fight that Rick has with the president was like dopey shit. And like,
00:11:18 I love that they incorporated all the things that have been brought up so far about the White House,
00:11:23 you know, that they go through all like, because you don't have to question all this crazy shit
00:11:28 that they're that's happening underneath the White House because we've already established
00:11:32 before that all this shit exists. Have those all been mentioned or have they been shown before?
00:11:35 I thought that about some of them. Remember, he at the beginning, he's talking about how like,
00:11:40 oh, don't go into the like the Lincoln slave, whatever. And like this other way, he's like
00:11:45 him. Yeah, the like Coke room, which they fall into the Coke room. Right. Right. He's faced
00:11:49 a bowl of coke. So you know, like, that's true. But some of the stuff that would have been harder
00:11:54 to explain, I guess, I really like seeing it's like the present the battle president aesthetic.
00:12:00 I was I like surprisingly a lot. He had all this tech, like, my favorite was when he pulls out
00:12:05 like his watch and points the laser at Rick and then an orbiting satellite shoots the laser down
00:12:09 from space. The hammer of dawn from Gears of War. That's the one. That's the one. Yeah, it was
00:12:14 fucking great. And like the little the little twins that he just blows the whistle and turn to monsters.
00:12:18 Yeah, it was good shit, man. That whole fight was great. Yeah, that was by far the most entertaining
00:12:24 part up until that point. It felt a little slow. But the fight was the the Rick and Morty genius
00:12:29 of lots of things happening really fast without explanation. But you kind of get it, you know,
00:12:34 like racing just just a little bit ahead of your able ability to parse the information,
00:12:40 you know, you have to be an intellectual to like Rick and Morty. There it is. There it is. Yeah.
00:12:45 So that leads me into what I really want to talk about meta wise, which is that I hate that the
00:12:51 show has gotten popular and I hate watching it with the world. I couldn't agree more. I know
00:12:58 this is this is this is the most hipster I'm ever going to sound. But I miss when Rick and Morty
00:13:03 was just my show, you know, I know exactly what I feel. And it's not even that I got in on the
00:13:08 ground floor of it. Like I found out about it like throughout season one, I was hearing the
00:13:13 early review saying like this is the best show on TV when no one was talking about it. You know,
00:13:19 film crit Hulk was I think the first person I heard it from. And, you know, I watched I caught up
00:13:25 in between seasons one and two. I got everyone I knew to watch it because I thought it was great.
00:13:30 Watch the commentaries, watch the episodes like four times, you know, and then season two rolled
00:13:35 around. And when they when they were the leaked episodes, I was way excited about them. Like I
00:13:41 watched each of those leaked episodes, you know, multiple times. Yep. And then it came for where
00:13:45 the show was actually airing. And I was watching it week by week. And first of all, I think watching
00:13:51 anything week by week will always make it worse. And this is I've stuck to I firmly fucking believe
00:13:56 in this. And every time I've tried to challenge it, I've come up failing. Like no matter what,
00:14:02 if you watch a show week by week, it will be worse. Because every time it falters a little,
00:14:07 it's a much bigger deal. You know, I marathon season one the first time. And it was just amazing.
00:14:14 Of course, it was just perfect. And I marathoned it like three more times. And I could eventually
00:14:20 pick out which episodes I thought were weaker from the others. But like it never felt like a big
00:14:24 deal. This season, when we got to the Revengencers episode, it was like, this is real. Like for a
00:14:30 whole week, it was like, ah, you know, I legit was not excited about doing this podcast for a lot
00:14:36 of the podcasts run after that episode. To me, like it was always scary. Like am I going to go in and
00:14:42 watch a shitty episode of Rick and Morty and have nothing to say about it? And and and then deal with
00:14:48 the comments who are never appreciative of what we have to say about the show. Like I very quickly
00:14:55 abandoned reading the comments for 60 minutes because it's a lot. It's they're weird because we
00:15:00 get lots of people who don't really know who we are because they're just like looking for Rick
00:15:04 and Morty podcast. I enjoy that. But yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah. And it's it's just been a
00:15:10 it's been a weird experience keeping up with the season. And like I feel like after season two,
00:15:16 which I think everyone agrees was overall great. Like even though for me, I felt less enthusiastic
00:15:22 about it than I was about season one just by way of watching it week by week. I still ultimately
00:15:27 enjoyed it a lot. I think after season two, everyone felt really entitled to great Rick and
00:15:31 Morty. You know, I hear what you're saying. And when season three rolled around and anything wrong
00:15:37 with it got picked apart to shreds because the people like me who loved the first two seasons
00:15:44 and wouldn't shut up about it like idiots like I feel stupid because all I did was rave and rave
00:15:51 and rave about how this show is so perfect. And now every time anything slightly imperfect happens,
00:15:56 everyone like, oh, the female writers. Rick and Morty wasn't the greatest show on television
00:16:04 this week. So, you know, so I mean, these female writers are just such intellectuals. We can't
00:16:12 understand what they're going for. And then people people who fucking rag on the Rick and
00:16:16 Morty fan base, which I as as is always the case, I've never seen the annoying fans. I've only
00:16:23 seen the people complaining about the annoying fans. You know, like I've never once, unless one of
00:16:29 the people who's making fun of them like literally reposts their shit. And then I see it and I go,
00:16:35 yeah, well, that guy's clearly a fucking like retarded, like literally retarded, you know,
00:16:40 like posting that like Facebook group of the people who see themselves as ricks. Yeah, right.
00:16:46 And are like favorite people in the world. And it's like, okay, these people are clearly not
00:16:51 indicative of most of the people watching this show. Like you can't say, oh, the Rick and Morty
00:16:57 fandom are so like, no. Well, you know, that's it's selective reasoning. Because, you know,
00:17:02 of course, you're gonna with people who want to defend the like the fandom, they'll look at the
00:17:06 people they like best and be like, Oh, those are the guys, they're not the real ones. Whereas if
00:17:09 you're on, if you're like looking for a reason, if you hear one person be annoying about Rick
00:17:13 and Morty, you're just gonna be like those fucking fans, they're all like this is the worst.
00:17:18 I don't get that. Like when I see an annoying per idiot, like participating in a fandom, I think,
00:17:25 wow, that's an annoying idiot, you know, has nothing to do with the show they like, because
00:17:29 guess what? Every show has annoying retarded fans. Like I can't name a show that doesn't have any
00:17:36 annoying retarded fans. So this whole position, like it's somehow Rick and Morty's like specifically
00:17:42 has this problem. It's like, no, it's just a show that people are talking about right now. So
00:17:46 those people boil to the surface, you know, it's just the nature of anything that gets too popular.
00:17:51 People will like it. There will always be someone who likes it to an obnoxious degree.
00:17:56 And just be big on the train for a burp. Nothing matters, Morty. Belch every God's not real burp.
00:18:04 I'm gay, Morty. Suck my dick. Yeah, it's inevitable. It's a nature of fandom.
00:18:10 I will say the most gratifying thing about the season was listening to the dick show and hearing
00:18:15 him reference Rick and Morty almost every week. Oh, that's cool. Not even anything specific,
00:18:21 just referencing the fact that he's watching it. And I was always like, yeah, Rick and Morty.
00:18:26 How nice for you, did you? How nice. I'm glad you enjoyed that. That's the best thing about watching
00:18:30 this show for me. You know, now I'm starting to get why people wanted to hear this episode of
00:18:36 60 Minutes come out. Because yeah, I feel a bit of emptiness after watching this episode. Just
00:18:44 and again, I think it is, I wouldn't frame it as entitlement to a good episode, but
00:18:48 heightened expectations certainly are there. And I mean, this was definitely a case where
00:18:55 about four minutes into the episode, I went, oh, okay, you know, maybe not even that far.
00:19:01 Like it was that feeling of I loading up the last episode thinking like, what's is it going to be
00:19:08 a big is it because I haven't heard anything. Nobody's been freaking out. Everybody's been
00:19:13 telling me when are you going to do the last 60 minutes? Nobody's been saying it's a crazy episode.
00:19:19 It's just been when are you going to do it? So I start watching it in a few minutes and I'm like,
00:19:23 oh, it's not going to be anything. Like if this is not going to be a big season closer episode,
00:19:28 you know, it's fine. But it's unfortunate that just like a standalone episode like the like the
00:19:34 toxic episode was like, in my opinion, quite superior to this one. This is like the whole point.
00:19:41 There's this joke of the president is jealous that Rick broke up with them or something. They
00:19:47 have a big president battle. There's some cool stuff that happens. And then Beth immediately has
00:19:52 confronted the issue that was set up last episode about if she's a clone or not. So both the one
00:19:56 was kind of not that interesting. And the other was like kind of kind of a premature ejaculation
00:20:03 on like a thing I was expecting to be a part of the narrative. And just like I was really
00:20:08 looking forward to going into next season as well and thinking about like, ooh, what does this
00:20:13 indicate that this is clone Beth or this is real Beth? What can I learn from this? They didn't have
00:20:17 to go that way. But I was like expecting that. And this really is just like blowing their load
00:20:21 immediately. And it's a little disappointing. So and I do. Yeah, the whole president plot. I mean,
00:20:27 this episode is kind of a sequel to the show me what you got episode season two, which was at
00:20:33 a perfect place in that season. Episode four, we've already been hit with some really heavy
00:20:38 sci fi stuff. Later, we'll get it with some more emotional stuff. But right here, here's a goofy
00:20:42 fun episode about saving America, bringing back which the president himself is not that memorable
00:20:48 a character from the episode. So like bringing him back, I had to kind of take a second and
00:20:53 like I remember thinking, oh, I guess president's still black in the Rick and Morty universe.
00:20:58 And then I remembered that it was a character that they had before. And I was like, oh, right.
00:21:03 Whenever I think about a situation like this, like, so yeah, this is this is basically them
00:21:07 saying like, OK, we've got this character, let's recycle him and do something interesting with
00:21:12 it. And they manage that reasonably OK. The problem that happens every time is that
00:21:18 I always my favorite example to go to is the party God from Adventure Time. The party God in
00:21:24 Adventure Time was the best character ever conceived because he was a giant floating wolf head
00:21:29 with the backwards baseball cap, who supercharges I think Jake at some point, so that he can go
00:21:36 like save. I was going to call him Morty fucking. What the fuck is the kid's name from Adventure
00:21:42 Time, Finn? Yes, thank you. And he just shows up at one point completely out of nowhere. He
00:21:46 does this magical thing. It's hilarious. And then he leaves. And then way later, like seasons
00:21:52 later in Adventure Time, they like made an episode developing the character of the party God. And
00:21:58 it was like, what the fuck are you doing? That that's like that's that's just such a misunderstanding
00:22:04 when he was a character supposed to be that exactly that is a one off joke. Rick Rick and
00:22:08 Morty's definitely had some of these issues. And I would say it's done reincorporation really well.
00:22:13 I think Bird Person was reincorporated well, like fucking the first time that the first
00:22:23 time that Gear Guy was brought back and Rick like replaces eyes with his balls. That was great.
00:22:29 The second time Gear Guy is brought back this season was terrible. And it was like, why do you
00:22:34 keep bringing back this character? Like why did it have to be him? You know, why is he there?
00:22:39 They're getting lazy, dude. I mean, I'm not saying that the show is like lazy itself, but but that
00:22:43 is a lazy idea to do. Exactly. Like we didn't get we didn't get a wealth of great new characters
00:22:50 this season. No, we did not. No, we did not. In fact, I can't think of one I particularly cared
00:22:54 about. A lot of people like that guy. What was his name? Cougar or Jaguar? That action guy. He was
00:23:00 he was pretty cool. Just whatever. He served as part of the episode and I don't ever really care
00:23:05 about seeing him again, though. So yeah, that's fair. Remember unity? Remember fucking unity from
00:23:09 season two? She is like, that's like the best character ever. I fucking love unity, not to
00:23:14 mention like the incredible relationship. It's like the best episode of the whole fucking show.
00:23:18 It is. It is one of the best. But like the ending is legendary. Yeah, I would say the first three
00:23:22 episodes of season no episodes two and three of season two are like the two best. What was the
00:23:27 other one besides the unity episode there? Episode two is the one with the fucking when they go to
00:23:33 Blitz and Chits. Oh, yeah. And and they meet the fart cloud. Yep. That's that whole one.
00:23:41 Wait, is that the same episode? I think so. No, yeah, you're right. I think it's got the it's
00:23:47 got crumb crumbopulus Michael in it. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Anyway, I can actually remember that name,
00:23:53 by the way. I could not have remembered that. That's a sanity. Yeah. I don't know what else to
00:24:01 say about this finale. It was kind of underwhelming. It was a, you know, the season was okay. I would
00:24:06 say this would not be I don't think the season would have disappointed people if it hadn't taken
00:24:10 so long to come out. Yes, it's important. And I hope I I wish upon a star that next time I'll
00:24:20 somehow be able to watch it weekly, but I know that or not watch it weekly rather, but I know
00:24:25 that won't be the case. Yeah, I'm going to end up having to and it's going to perpetually ruin
00:24:29 this show for me as this happened to every other show I've ever watched weekly.
00:24:34 You know what? I do want to I want to challenge you. Don't you think that our enjoyment of
00:24:38 Aromanga Sensei was heightened by the fact that we had to stew on every episode in between them
00:24:43 and just just get ready enjoyment of our reactions to it. Exactly. That's what that that's what was
00:24:49 all about. That's what it was all about. Incidentally, Made in Abyss Weekly will probably finish that at
00:24:53 some point. Indeed. Indeed. Very soon, I think. And if anybody cares who listens to this show.
00:24:59 By the way, let me let me let me shout out two jokes that were hilarious and I love
00:25:05 do it quick because I got a poop. Okay, we'll do. So remember when when the President is growing
00:25:10 back in size and they just give him the shirt because apparently he needs to swing his dick
00:25:14 around. Hilarious. I laughed. Good. Good. The other one was when it just went when the President
00:25:23 is like ordering this guy to clean his room and he's just like, I don't think you even know what
00:25:27 Secretary of Interior means. Just small side. I laughed. That was a weird one, but I did think
00:25:33 it was. Well, you know, Rick and Morty is a pretty intellectual series. You know, not everybody's
00:25:37 going to get it. You know, you got to you got to think about it. Oh, and also when when Morty is
00:25:41 just like, I don't know, Commander in Queef want to count my pubes, I laughed. I laughed. That's
00:25:46 it. I got nothing else. All right, everybody, see you in the future. Possibly in years like nothing
00:25:52 matters. Yep, we're all dead universes. Choices don't matter. Consequences don't matter. Kill
00:25:58 yourself. Do whatever you want, everybody. That's that's my thing. Bye bye. Oh my God,
00:26:04 I almost forgot to add the last thing. Hey, everybody, best guy ever. World famous Rick
00:26:07 and Morty analyst here. Yo, you know how Minecraft was in this fucking episode? Oh,
00:26:11 I thought it was really dope how like in real life, like the President's portal like had to be
00:26:14 lit with a fucking lighter like in Minecraft. I am a Minecraft specialist. Thank you very much.
00:26:20 I'll see you next time. Bye bye.
