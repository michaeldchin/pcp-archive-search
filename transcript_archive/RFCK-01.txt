00:00:00 This is a podcast called The Pro Crastinators Podcast. A variety podcast running since 2015.
00:00:30 This is a special edition of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We are going to be talking about and playing everyone's favorite game, Nuclear Throne.
00:00:43 Tell them why I am.
00:00:45 I'm your host, Ben Saint. Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.
00:00:50 Didn't you draw something?
00:00:52 The.com slash Davoo.
00:00:55 And I'm the first person who's talking over other people.
00:00:58 And you're Munchy.
00:01:00 And Munchy. Our friend Munchy.com slash Munchy.
00:01:03 I'm going to become a wrestler.
00:01:07 Didn't you draw something, Ben?
00:01:09 No.
00:01:10 Okay.
00:01:11 Yeah, I didn't think so.
00:01:12 Yeah, patreon.com slash Ben Saint.
00:01:14 Is the exclusive portal to find my work.
00:01:18 All right.
00:01:19 StComics.com.
00:01:21 I drew a comic.
00:01:22 And Davoo, don't you also claim to do something worthwhile?
00:01:26 I made a video about Nuclear Throne. And that's the only video I've ever made.
00:01:31 Oh, mama. That's really greasing up my.
00:01:36 Something that may be relevant to the people listening to this is that Munchy, you're the one who's drawn all of Digibroses' YouTube avatars, eh?
00:01:44 Yes. That's true. And I hate every single one of them.
00:01:49 Oh, you.
00:01:51 I like your work, Munchy. I think your work has a lot of character to it.
00:01:55 You make that hard line edging looking look better than most people do.
00:02:02 That's what I fucking hate about it.
00:02:03 Well, you hate the hard lines.
00:02:06 You do a pretty decent job with it.
00:02:08 All right. Well, this is about the one and only game, the one game ever made, Nuclear Throne.
00:02:15 Right, so Munchy, you are the resident expert because you're the only one that's beaten the throne.
00:02:23 You double looped, oh my gosh. I don't even know what double looping means.
00:02:27 It means beating the game twice.
00:02:29 All right, well, I guess I could have used my context.
00:02:32 In a row, like without dying. And it gets harder the second time.
00:02:34 God, you're fucking, I'm supposed to see his magic sage, Davoo. He doesn't know anything.
00:02:38 He's like a little fucking baby who can't learn anything.
00:02:41 I'm supposed to be the teacher.
00:02:43 I haven't looked up anything about the game. I've tried not to spoil myself.
00:02:47 That's good. That's what everyone should do.
00:02:50 I've just watched my video on it, a status update.
00:02:53 I still haven't gotten past Little Hunter, but well before even making the video,
00:02:57 I've watched play sessions of people looping up to four times.
00:03:01 I've even watched people looping twice on the most recent edition of the game.
00:03:05 So I am quite familiar with it. So, yeah.
00:03:08 Are you guys playing right now? I'm playing.
00:03:10 Yeah, I'm playing right now.
00:03:11 I don't know if this is the thing that's ever going to catch on.
00:03:15 It's this new genre that we've invented, this terrible abomination of content.
00:03:20 Ultra podcast 3D. Let's play a radio show, but you don't get to see the game.
00:03:26 Don't get to see it. And it's not like a podcast where one of the people is only,
00:03:30 is playing it and everyone else gets to just talk.
00:03:33 We're all going to be distracted playing it.
00:03:35 And you have to hear us making the noises.
00:03:38 This is going to be as much bedlam as the world of Nuclear Throne itself.
00:03:44 You know, I'm okay with that.
00:03:46 Listen, guys, I'm going to update you on my progress right now.
00:03:49 I have employed the secret ancient technique of ignoring weapon chests,
00:03:53 and I just got a super chest and I just got, I just got a wrench.
00:03:56 Fuck yeah, I just got a wrench. That means I'm all set for the sewers.
00:03:59 Yeah, well, I definitely found that out.
00:04:01 Wrench is my way of life.
00:04:02 The game tells you.
00:04:04 Well, Wrench was my way of life until I unlocked chicken.
00:04:07 I'm currently playing chicken right now.
00:04:09 When you have chicken, you don't need the wrench, which is great,
00:04:11 because I don't even, I never, there was to be, sometimes I'd start playing
00:04:15 and I wouldn't get the wrench in the first couple of levels,
00:04:17 so I just start over.
00:04:18 Yeah.
00:04:19 Because without the wrench, it's not worth it.
00:04:20 I mean, I can manage the sewers with a gun, but I don't like to.
00:04:24 You people are fucking babies.
00:04:26 It's not that I think the wrench is kids.
00:04:29 I could pick you up and throw you to do.
00:04:31 No, no, it's not that it's not, it's not, it's not that the wrench is easy.
00:04:37 It's that it's fun as hell.
00:04:40 It is fun.
00:04:41 By the way, I just died in the sewers, which obviously means I'm pretty distracted.
00:04:44 Oh, my gosh, God.
00:04:46 Okay, hold on.
00:04:47 How many hours do you have in this game, Davoo?
00:04:49 I have like 23.
00:04:50 Oh, man.
00:04:52 And you haven't even seen the labs yet, dude.
00:04:55 You don't know what labs.
00:04:56 Well, I've seen them on YouTube.
00:04:57 I know.
00:04:58 Wrench, that's absurd.
00:04:59 How do you know they even exist if you haven't seen it?
00:05:02 Everyone could be lying to you, Davoo.
00:05:04 Yeah, I've always been on the lookout for that kind of stuff.
00:05:07 Wrench, did you check how much time I have?
00:05:10 Yes, yes, you have 19 hours.
00:05:12 Oh, cool.
00:05:13 Yeah, I know.
00:05:14 Wow.
00:05:15 See, because for me, 23 hours is impressive.
00:05:17 Like, that's as much time as I spend on games these days.
00:05:20 Davoo, Davoo, Davoo.
00:05:21 I have 372 hours in this game.
00:05:24 Excellent.
00:05:25 Oh, my God.
00:05:26 Oh, fuck.
00:05:27 All right, well, I'll just, I think I expected to get, I expected to get good at this game faster than I actually have.
00:05:34 It's been harder than I thought because I was already in Binding of Isaac Pro from back in the day.
00:05:39 This game is very different.
00:05:40 And I mean, it's basically the same game.
00:05:41 No, it's so different.
00:05:43 It's basically the same game.
00:05:44 It's, it's in principle, in principle, it's the same.
00:05:48 One, it doesn't look bad.
00:05:50 Yeah, exactly.
00:05:51 I don't...
00:05:52 Binding of Isaac look great.
00:05:53 What are you talking about?
00:05:54 I mean, okay, maybe it'll look great.
00:05:55 Cause like, when I'm actually playing Super Meat Boy, I think as, that's the same artist, right?
00:06:00 Yes, yes.
00:06:01 Right.
00:06:02 It's not fun for me to watch, but when I'm playing it, I'm like, okay, whatever.
00:06:05 I disagree actually.
00:06:07 I think...
00:06:08 But even it doesn't look that good in my opinion.
00:06:10 I'm just like, it just looks like everything is really dull.
00:06:13 Maybe it's because I spent lots and lots and lots of time on Newgrounds.
00:06:15 I'm jaded to that look.
00:06:17 But with Nuclear Throne, it was, I was looking for something to make a video out of and then one screenshot into looking at Nuclear Throne.
00:06:24 I'm like, that looks like something I would be into.
00:06:27 The art is the only thing I can't nitpick in this game because I fucking love it.
00:06:31 Yeah.
00:06:32 One look at Nuclear Throne and I was pretty much sold.
00:06:35 It immediately looks exactly like the kind of game I want to play.
00:06:38 This was actually, this game, getting into this game was the end of me like, talk, like being worried about pixel art.
00:06:45 Talking about how maybe we should stop doing pixel art.
00:06:47 Pixel shit!
00:06:48 I love pixel shit.
00:06:49 Cause I was like...
00:06:50 I love pixel shit.
00:06:51 Yeah.
00:06:52 What is this Undertale game?
00:06:53 Pixel art always...
00:06:54 It's just some pixel shit, man.
00:06:56 Pixel art always works out well.
00:06:58 And I'm just like, it makes games look so similar.
00:07:00 But then I was like, I was playing Nuclear Throne and I'm like, you know what?
00:07:02 Yeah, but that's not really true.
00:07:03 Fuck it.
00:07:04 Forget about it.
00:07:05 Yeah, exactly.
00:07:06 Oh yeah, they all look way different.
00:07:07 That's the other thing.
00:07:08 But also, it's just too effective.
00:07:09 It just works too well to not use it constantly.
00:07:13 And I mean, it's a simple, effective way.
00:07:16 To look professional.
00:07:17 Like, yeah.
00:07:18 And it works.
00:07:19 And it fucking works.
00:07:20 So why shouldn't people do it?
00:07:22 Cause in my journeys of trying to dig up random obscure Steam games to make videos out of,
00:07:28 I've discovered just how many...
00:07:30 Like, we all know about those Steam Greenlight trailer things that are utterly terrible.
00:07:34 But there's a lot of stuff that's like in a middle ground period where it's a competent game.
00:07:38 It's like on the level of an old LJN game rather than on the level of Big Riggs, for instance.
00:07:45 And those are the most unpleasant in a way because it's like, wow, this person is actually good at one thing.
00:07:51 Like, some of them will have decent level design.
00:07:53 Some of them will have decent graphics.
00:07:55 And it's like, if only this guy worked in a team where he only had to do the one thing he's good at,
00:07:59 instead of all the millions of other things he's not good at.
00:08:01 They always have terrible font choices.
00:08:03 They're usually really badly optimized.
00:08:05 And things feel gross and unprofessional.
00:08:08 But when they're pixel art, that's never...
00:08:10 That's almost...
00:08:11 That's not as much of an issue usually.
00:08:13 And I'm just like, dang it.
00:08:15 I guess pixel art just has to be a thing.
00:08:18 And we just have to love it as much as we want to.
00:08:21 Well, see, I think pixel art is better than anything.
00:08:26 Yeah, I can't necessarily disagree.
00:08:29 I mean, that's why I don't like...
00:08:31 I just like the aesthetic.
00:08:32 I just like the anti-Islist and shit.
00:08:34 I don't like it.
00:08:35 I just like the aesthetic, even aside from all the development advantages it offers.
00:08:41 Yeah.
00:08:42 It's like, in order to have an aesthetic that's as appealing as Nuclear Throne without pixel art,
00:08:47 you have to be Ori and the Blind Forest level.
00:08:50 And it's like, nope.
00:08:52 Have you guys seen...
00:08:54 Have you seen a sword and sorcery?
00:08:56 I've seen it.
00:08:57 I don't know anything about it, but I've seen one screenshot.
00:09:00 Now there's a game with pixel art that's really attractive and really unique.
00:09:05 It really has its own atmosphere to it.
00:09:07 I'm sure I know the name.
00:09:09 I'm sure I know the game.
00:09:10 I just can't connect the name to the game when the name is that generic sounding.
00:09:14 Yeah.
00:09:15 Dude, imagine a dude with a sword and he's in like a medieval times.
00:09:19 It's that one, yeah.
00:09:22 It's a girl though.
00:09:23 I don't want 90% share.
00:09:25 I got to the rainy zone and then died again.
00:09:28 Again, I'm just running shit up.
00:09:29 The rainy zone?
00:09:32 It's a junkyard, right?
00:09:33 Yeah, junkyard.
00:09:34 I just died on Mad Dog.
00:09:37 Scrapyard.
00:09:38 Yeah, I just died on Mad Dog.
00:09:40 What I like about chicken is that I can run into fucking everything.
00:09:43 And then even when I die, I have a chance of coming back.
00:09:45 Actually, when I died, I actually did come back, but I got my health back by hitting one of those explosion sniper guys.
00:09:51 So I killed myself in reviving myself and died again.
00:09:55 Dude, I used to do that all the time.
00:09:57 I've pretty much gotten over.
00:09:59 I haven't unlocked.
00:10:00 I've only unlocked like half the characters.
00:10:02 Like chicken is the most recent one I've unlocked.
00:10:03 I haven't unlocked white bee yet.
00:10:04 I just unlocked chicken today.
00:10:06 Dude, white bee, I keep telling you how to do it too.
00:10:09 I know, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
00:10:11 I'm sorry.
00:10:12 I can do it in this podcast.
00:10:13 I don't know.
00:10:14 Yeah, you should do that.
00:10:15 He's the second best character in the game, dude.
00:10:17 Wait, who?
00:10:18 I gotta get the freaking...
00:10:19 Oh my god.
00:10:20 He's the cool one.
00:10:21 The Eskimo.
00:10:22 The triangle.
00:10:24 Oh, young Venus.
00:10:26 Yeah.
00:10:27 And it's so cool because it's like, I've seen like one fan art picture of him with Bill from Gravity Falls.
00:10:32 Oh my fucking god.
00:10:34 They're the same character.
00:10:36 Oh my fucking god.
00:10:38 They're the same character.
00:10:39 I know they are.
00:10:40 I know they are.
00:10:41 It's like reliving everything that I used to be.
00:10:44 Not in like a bad way, but like reliving my experiences with this game, like down to a T.
00:10:49 And I like that.
00:10:50 Oh, I see.
00:10:51 So it's like, so it's like you're looking at it through our fresh eyes.
00:10:54 Yeah.
00:10:55 You're like a newborn baby.
00:10:56 You're like a newborn baby.
00:10:57 It's the fact that this is new.
00:10:58 In all the right ways, Finn.
00:10:59 This is what I hate about early access.
00:11:00 This is a new game, but you're an expert in it.
00:11:03 You have all these memories in it.
00:11:04 You know, that's FU.
00:11:05 Oh yeah, that brings me to the point.
00:11:07 Like I said before, as soon as I saw this game, I knew I wanted to play it, but I refused
00:11:11 to because it was an early access.
00:11:13 Oh.
00:11:14 Well, I mean, I've seen very early versions of it.
00:11:17 It did not look very different in its early ones.
00:11:20 Yeah.
00:11:21 It had most of the same stuff.
00:11:22 But I still didn't, I still didn't, I didn't want to play it in early access because I didn't
00:11:25 want to get good at a game that would then go on to not count for anything.
00:11:29 Like, like I play this roguelike game called Dungeon Crawlstone Soup and the game is an
00:11:35 active development and every time they update it, like the classes change around all the
00:11:39 time.
00:11:40 Like the first time I ever beat the game, I was a crusader and now the crusader class
00:11:47 doesn't even exist anymore.
00:11:48 It's been completely retooled and renamed.
00:11:50 And like, so like if I were to tell someone how I won the game back then, they would be
00:11:55 like, they wouldn't even mean anything because the shit didn't even exist anymore.
00:11:59 Gosh darn it.
00:12:00 I died in the sewers again.
00:12:02 Again, I'm just running right into everything.
00:12:04 This is great.
00:12:05 I'm having a good old time, yo.
00:12:06 You know what?
00:12:07 I'm okay with that.
00:12:08 And I'm sure the game is too.
00:12:10 Yeah, I'm not, I'm not really trying that hard.
00:12:14 I just killed like three basilisks or salamanders or whatever.
00:12:18 Yeah.
00:12:19 The single shotgun blast.
00:12:22 I remember when I first got this game, it was gifted to me by a friend.
00:12:26 He said, you should play this game, dude.
00:12:27 And I said, all right.
00:12:28 And then six months later, I decided maybe I should play that game.
00:12:33 Yep, destination steam, y'all.
00:12:36 I think the, like literally the second level was just, all right, this is my favorite game.
00:12:43 It's so, it's so, just the way you move and the way you interact with everything is so
00:12:47 crystal clear and nice and polished.
00:12:50 It has, okay, I maintain that it is basically Binding of Isaac, but it does have a way better
00:12:55 game feel.
00:12:56 I don't know how you can even like, like say that though.
00:13:01 Well, there, dude, they're both, they're both, you know, top-down shooters.
00:13:06 Yes.
00:13:07 They both have roguelike elements.
00:13:09 They both have randomized, you know, power-ups and permadeath, randomized levels.
00:13:13 And that's it.
00:13:15 That's it.
00:13:16 Wow, they're both in the same genre.
00:13:18 Yeah.
00:13:19 All right, fine.
00:13:20 Face it then.
00:13:21 We don't like you anymore.
00:13:23 Well, what other games are there that fit that description?
00:13:26 Other than like obvious knockoffs of one or the other?
00:13:31 The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is not like the Binding of Isaac.
00:13:37 I haven't played Rebirth.
00:13:39 See?
00:13:40 Uh, whatever, man.
00:13:43 Everyone could be lying to you.
00:13:44 It could be a Gallagher.
00:13:45 Eventually I'll go back to it.
00:13:46 Yeah, it was, it was an interesting story with, you know, the YV thing because obviously this
00:13:51 game came out after Gravity Falls, but YV is based on an older game by the dude from 2010.
00:13:56 Yeah, it's better.
00:13:57 Yeah.
00:13:58 It's better than Gravity Falls?
00:14:01 Well, yes, but then this...
00:14:03 What's better than what?
00:14:05 Uh, Gun Gods is better than this game only because it sets out to what it achieves to do, I feel.
00:14:11 Wait, this game doesn't set out to do what it sets out to do?
00:14:14 Well, I'm very jaded with this game and I'm going to explain why because I got, well,
00:14:20 what were you about to say then?
00:14:22 I was going to say, yeah, tell us why you hate this game.
00:14:24 Yeah, dude, what the heck?
00:14:26 You're supposed to... this isn't...
00:14:29 What is Vayre Emotion, y'all?
00:14:32 All right, okay.
00:14:33 I got this game, I would say, five months before release and there were a lot of features that
00:14:42 Landbeer, like, wanted to do.
00:14:44 Well, I wouldn't say wanted to do, but needed to do.
00:14:48 And they didn't deliver and that's why I'm sort of jaded to the whole thing and I feel
00:14:51 like whatever...
00:14:52 You think it could have been better?
00:14:54 I think that's the one thing with Early Access games that is just inherent.
00:14:58 It's that you, like, see the process of, like, how it's...
00:15:01 Like, all games are like that.
00:15:02 Like, all games don't end up being quite, you know, if they were initially...
00:15:06 The problem with Early Access is that the audience then shares in on that disappointment.
00:15:09 Yeah, exactly.
00:15:10 So what the heck was missing from this game?
00:15:11 Because it feels quite complete to me.
00:15:13 Yeah, yeah, maybe I don't even want to know what it's missing.
00:15:16 Yeah, you know what?
00:15:18 Yo, we're doing this podcast for a reason.
00:15:20 What is it missing?
00:15:21 Cheese, Davoo.
00:15:22 You're getting hostile.
00:15:24 Okay, it's missing Friendship Mode, which was four-player co-op, which is a real thing.
00:15:31 Oh.
00:15:32 Oh.
00:15:33 Hey, hey, hey, Davoo.
00:15:35 This podcast would be a lot better if we could all be playing it together.
00:15:40 Yeah, it would be.
00:15:41 No, it would be a lot better if we were all playing in co-op.
00:15:44 That would be rad.
00:15:45 Yeah.
00:15:46 Is there a planned multiplayer coming?
00:15:49 Well, well, there is multiplayer.
00:15:52 There is?
00:15:53 It's...
00:15:54 Oh my...
00:15:55 Yeah.
00:15:56 There is?
00:15:57 It's local, though.
00:15:58 Oh, that sucks.
00:15:59 Oh, I want to tell you my new band name.
00:16:01 It's called Extremely Donking Technical Challenge.
00:16:04 And that's because a quote from Rami when the developer says they're not going to put it in an online multiplayer,
00:16:09 because it would be an extremely daunting technical challenge for a 2D Twitch game.
00:16:13 And I really like that quote.
00:16:14 I'm going to put it up on my wall.
00:16:16 Extremely.
00:16:17 I got the screwdriver, so I'm going to hit that against a truck or a vehicle in the junkyard, right?
00:16:24 Do you know the car?
00:16:25 Do you know what it looks like?
00:16:27 No, you can describe it to me when I get there.
00:16:30 It's a slightly different color than the other cars.
00:16:32 That's all you need to know.
00:16:33 Yeah.
00:16:34 Right.
00:16:35 Yeah, because I've seen footage of YV and read him on the wiki.
00:16:39 I'm like, whoa, that is wicked cool.
00:16:41 More cool.
00:16:42 He's more cool than...
00:16:44 He doesn't seem like the kind of character that I'd want to play,
00:16:47 but then again, I think I'm playing the game wrong,
00:16:49 because I only get real defensively.
00:16:51 Chicken's the character that I want to play,
00:16:53 but I just appreciate seeing YV and knowing it's a thing.
00:16:55 He's more cool than Bill, because he doesn't mess around with a bunch of random kids in freakin' Washington.
00:17:01 He does whatever once he goes and kills things.
00:17:03 It's way cooler.
00:17:04 I like him more because he's black.
00:17:06 Yeah.
00:17:07 Who? Young Venus?
00:17:09 Are you black?
00:17:10 Are you going to be one of those surprise black people who I didn't think was black?
00:17:15 Surprise black people?
00:17:19 Dude, the number of people who turned out to be black, British, or Australian,
00:17:24 who I've known online is impeccable, the number.
00:17:27 Well, okay, okay.
00:17:28 First of all, we're going to transition to a new topic.
00:17:30 What do you think I look like based on what you know about me?
00:17:35 Like, you're scribing great detail.
00:17:37 Oh, shit, Sledgehammer.
00:17:38 Well, it's weird because you have such a high-pitched voice or like a pretty high-pitched voice,
00:17:42 but I vaguely remember Digibro describing you as being like looking way older than you are.
00:17:47 Am I getting you confused with someone else?
00:17:49 No.
00:17:50 No, that's him.
00:17:51 Okay, because...
00:17:52 I don't know if he looks older.
00:17:53 He just looks bigger.
00:17:54 Okay.
00:17:55 Well, I mean, I did have a full beard when I met you, so...
00:17:58 Yeah, but it was a young person beard.
00:18:00 True.
00:18:01 I feel like it's gotten way thicker and I feel like between my fingers when I rub my face
00:18:07 sensually during my sessions...
00:18:09 It's very intimidating.
00:18:10 Yeah.
00:18:11 It's a very intimidating description.
00:18:13 I want to talk about the game.
00:18:15 Okay.
00:18:16 I want to talk about strats.
00:18:17 Okay.
00:18:18 I want to talk about builds and how you guys...
00:18:20 Builds.
00:18:21 ...prefer to play.
00:18:22 Because like I was saying, because I've been playing Crystal and I'm just...
00:18:25 I'm very disposed in games in general to play with them defensively and to be like very
00:18:29 healing.
00:18:30 Mm-hmm.
00:18:31 And so I...
00:18:32 Crystal suits that urge in me, so I'm always getting bloodlust and I'm always getting a
00:18:39 second stomach and just trying to, you know, heal myself as much as I can.
00:18:43 Yeah, everything I pick is healing related pretty much.
00:18:46 Mm-hmm.
00:18:47 Except for the melee extension.
00:18:49 That's the only thing that I always pick that isn't healing related.
00:18:53 Oh, you got the melee DLC, the extension pack for it?
00:18:57 No, like the thing that makes your melee more...
00:19:01 Yeah, Davoo!
00:19:02 ...makes you move further.
00:19:03 Okay, cool.
00:19:04 Yeah, Davoo.
00:19:05 Yeah.
00:19:06 Brilliant.
00:19:07 Excellent.
00:19:08 So I just came...
00:19:09 Whoops.
00:19:10 I came back to life with chicken and then immediately died again.
00:19:11 Oh, crud.
00:19:12 And there was a freaking health pack right in front of me.
00:19:15 Dang, dude.
00:19:16 That's fucking rough.
00:19:17 I like how we just totally just didn't answer a bit.
00:19:19 Davoo, you go first.
00:19:20 I'm gonna die again.
00:19:21 I'm a mad dog.
00:19:22 Fucking mad dog, man.
00:19:23 I need concentration for mad dog.
00:19:25 What is it that I need to answer?
00:19:28 Uh, what have we been asked?
00:19:30 I don't remember what you asked.
00:19:31 Loadout strats.
00:19:32 Oh, yeah.
00:19:33 Yeah, what's your strategy and like what kind of character do you choose to play?
00:19:37 Um, well, I was playing eyes constantly because it was...
00:19:42 One strategy I had, which was probably stupid, was holding down the right key constantly
00:19:46 because then, as eyes, it would cause everything to move in a slightly more predictable pattern
00:19:52 because it's all moving slightly towards me.
00:19:54 That was my philosophy.
00:19:55 It was my theory.
00:19:56 Is that if everything is moving towards me, then I'm more in control of the environment
00:20:00 because I know where everything is going slightly.
00:20:02 But then, of course, it was also very distracting holding down the right key constantly.
00:20:07 I actually do that, actually.
00:20:10 And I think it gets less distracting, but I don't know if it's different strokes or different people.
00:20:18 Eyes seems really weird, and I don't think I want to fuck with them.
00:20:22 Eyes, if you get euphoria in his throne butt, you don't have to play the game.
00:20:27 What's his throne butt do?
00:20:29 It makes you win the game.
00:20:31 What?
00:20:32 I'm confused.
00:20:35 Basically, it makes his telekinesis much stronger, and by much stronger, I mean, you can stand in front of the throne
00:20:43 and it won't be able to hit you.
00:20:45 Oh, well, yeah, I've gotten that, but I haven't been able to win the game with it.
00:20:52 Maybe you can beat the final boss with it.
00:20:55 I mean, I would say that I thought his throne butt was much better than it actually is
00:21:00 because on loops, you don't want that many freaks inside of your vicinity.
00:21:06 But I think if you get euphoria and then just normal eyes, he's still good.
00:21:14 I think eyes gets a bad rat.
00:21:16 I hate Crystal's throne butt. I never get it.
00:21:20 I can see why it's good, but I'm not good enough to get the most out.
00:21:26 Crystal's active is a shield.
00:21:30 Crystal's throne butt doesn't last as long, but if you keep holding down the mouse,
00:21:37 when it cancels, you teleport to wherever your cursor is,
00:21:41 which is really weird, and I can see how it would be so good,
00:21:46 but I always spaz out, and it ends up ending before I expected to,
00:21:51 so I don't have my cursor in a good position.
00:21:54 I end up teleporting to some places I don't want to be.
00:21:57 It doesn't make a whole lot of diegetical sense.
00:22:00 It's kind of ineligently conceived right there.
00:22:03 What the heck is that supposed to be in the universe?
00:22:06 I don't know about that. I'm just saying it kills me more often than it saves me.
00:22:11 I'm actually going to tell you a secret before I go on bin about why I hate this game more.
00:22:16 Do either of you know what the purple weapon's mean?
00:22:21 I'm in the snow town, by the way.
00:22:24 Do either of you know, have you ever seen a purple weapon?
00:22:29 No.
00:22:31 Died in the sewers again.
00:22:33 You're really good to view.
00:22:35 When you get a crown, or have you seen a crown before?
00:22:40 Yeah, I got the crown. I got a crown once.
00:22:42 Okay, when you get a crown, there's a chance that the weapon chest will turn into a purple weapon chest,
00:22:48 and that will give you a cursed weapon.
00:22:50 Oh, the cursed ones, yeah.
00:22:52 You can't drop them, but they are like a higher tier than the level that you get it.
00:22:58 If you get a cursed weapon and you go to the crystal caves, which is 4-1,
00:23:04 something scary will happen, and you'll pee yourself.
00:23:08 Not like in a funny way, but in like a scared, like home alone, like I drank too much Pepsi way.
00:23:16 Home Alone is a funny movie.
00:23:18 I got tired of just running it, so I'm going to actually try now.
00:23:23 Yeah, I feel like there should be a nuclear-thrown character based on Kevin from Home Alone.
00:23:31 What would Kevin's action be?
00:23:33 I just had a snow golem throw a car at me, and it hit me, and it's never happened before,
00:23:37 but luckily I'm crystal, so I can take it.
00:23:39 Oh my god!
00:23:41 Oh man, that sucked.
00:23:43 When that happened to me, I was like, what the fuck hit me?
00:23:46 Thankfully, I was recording to find out, and I was so mad,
00:23:49 because I was like, that doesn't look very threatening.
00:23:52 There's no giant wind-up, there's no giant arrow going,
00:23:55 watch out, this is going to kill you immediately, all at once.
00:24:02 You know, I can't forget to take advantage of Chicken's weapon throw ability,
00:24:06 because that means I can get through this while wielding both my sword and my screwdriver,
00:24:12 without having any actual guns, if I take advantage of her weapon throw ability.
00:24:17 I'm concentrating so hard trying to dodge all these fucking wolf bullets.
00:24:22 I'm going back to eyes, all eyes on me.
00:24:25 Ooh, that's something you just said.
00:24:29 Yeah.
00:24:31 First level of Snowden is done.
00:24:35 Wow.
00:24:37 Let's talk about how this game is literally undertale.
00:24:41 One, you have pixels on screen.
00:24:46 There's hearts.
00:24:48 Yeah, there's hearts in this game.
00:24:50 It's a bad time.
00:24:52 It's a bad time? You always have a bad time.
00:24:54 Well, I mean, the character does, that's for sure.
00:24:56 Yeah.
00:24:58 And also, there's someone who wears a coat.
00:25:02 There we go.
00:25:04 I think we should get Toby Fox to see this.
00:25:06 Rebel looks exactly like Sans, and it's really distracting.
00:25:08 Well, let's see.
00:25:10 I mean, I guess I can see what you mean by that.
00:25:14 I mean, I saw the sprite and I thought it was Sans for a second.
00:25:17 Wait, who do you think it was, Sans?
00:25:19 Rebel in her costume.
00:25:22 I thought you had bought like a skin.
00:25:28 No, but believe me, I worked for this.
00:25:31 So I've got really shitty mutations right now.
00:25:33 I've got Throne Butt, which I don't want because it'll kill me.
00:25:35 Wait, wait, what do you have?
00:25:37 Extra Feet, Hammerhead, or Bolt Marrow.
00:25:41 Bolt Marrow is fucking amazing.
00:25:43 Shut your garbage eating eye hole.
00:25:46 But I don't have a bolt weapon.
00:25:48 Well.
00:25:50 Alright, fine.
00:25:51 Just because I've never taken it before, I'll take it and I'll get a bolt weapon, I guess.
00:25:56 Believe me, dude.
00:25:58 I didn't tell you what my strats are.
00:26:01 No, you're the only one whose strats matter.
00:26:04 You're the only one who's winning and won the game.
00:26:07 Why don't you tell me what your strats are, and I'll tell you what you're doing wrong.
00:26:10 Yeah.
00:26:11 I've told you my strats are get all the healing items.
00:26:14 Killed by Little Hunter.
00:26:16 Yeah, get all the healing items, get Bloodlust, get Second Stomach, get Rabbit's Foot, and Rhino Skin,
00:26:23 and just heal myself into an early grave.
00:26:26 Alright, well.
00:26:28 Rabbit Paw is necessary for any good run, so you're right there.
00:26:33 Also, I just looped, by the way.
00:26:35 Oh, shit.
00:26:37 And I died two times, of course, so that's why I'm behind.
00:26:40 But anyway.
00:26:42 Hold on.
00:26:44 I can't fucking speak.
00:26:46 Crystal, her throne butt.
00:26:48 Let me tell you something, first of all, by the way.
00:26:50 Yeah, please.
00:26:51 Before it was like this, it was still teleporting, but you teleported before you went out of your shield.
00:27:03 You would click on some part of the screen, and you would instantly go there, well inside your shield,
00:27:09 and then you would come out of it normally.
00:27:11 Oh, so you'd hold the right mouse button, you'd be in the shield, and then while you were shielding,
00:27:15 you'd click and it would teleport you?
00:27:17 Yeah.
00:27:18 That sounds cool.
00:27:19 Yeah, it was much better, but they decided to nerf her because she was too good, and she still is too good,
00:27:24 because she's a safe character, and I hate safe characters in video games.
00:27:27 Yeah.
00:27:29 And then you just not play them, because I almost never play freaking Crystal,
00:27:33 because I'm like, okay, I'm tired of dying, time to play the character with the shield,
00:27:37 but then I go into the shield, and I immediately get bored.
00:27:39 I'm like, all right, back to the crazy ones.
00:27:41 Yeah.
00:27:42 See, I don't find Crystal boring, because with Crystal, I don't have to wait for enemies to stop.
00:27:46 I don't have to be safe to come out of cover.
00:27:48 I can just rush right out of cover, and I don't have to even fucking worry about anything.
00:27:52 True.
00:27:53 Like in Dark Souls, almost everything I did, I expect myself to basically be able to run up at things.
00:27:58 I didn't wear pants, didn't have any armor, and I got the Demon Spear, because it has a crazy long range,
00:28:09 and I just played that constantly.
00:28:11 I've never played Dark Souls before, so I can't comment on that, but I will say I want to play Dark Souls,
00:28:17 because you can be a black guy in it.
00:28:19 Continue.
00:28:20 Well, you're mostly without any skin.
00:28:23 Your blackness will not be appreciated.
00:28:25 But I can be black, right?
00:28:26 My brother did make a black knight called Sir Homie in Dark Souls.
00:28:32 The point is, I tend to favor characters like chicken.
00:28:35 One recent exception is in Downwell, I picked the version of the game mode where you have the most health,
00:28:41 because you are really slick and fast, no matter which version of that game you pick.
00:28:46 Nobody agrees with me, but for me, Floaty is so much easier than any other mode.
00:28:54 Playing Floaty feels like easy mode to me.
00:28:56 I do like Floaty, that's pretty good.
00:28:59 I can't, yeah.
00:29:01 Maybe it's because I don't do any other mode, but I've never won on any other mode.
00:29:05 Well, I have never won on any other mode other than I've never won it.
00:29:09 So, let's talk about Nuclear Throne's characters, which are great.
00:29:12 Wait, no, before you do that on Downwell, I remember I played it for two seconds and said,
00:29:17 this is the hardest thing I've ever seen before in my entire life, and I got my money back, I refunded it.
00:29:22 Oh, bullshit, bullshit, fuck you, that guy.
00:29:27 Downwell deserves so much.
00:29:29 I would consider Downwell and Nuclear Throne to be pretty similar aesthetically,
00:29:33 not aesthetically in terms of visuals, but aesthetically in terms of how it makes you feel with its challenge,
00:29:38 because it's just this impossible challenge that you can just bang your head against 5,200,000 in three times,
00:29:45 and it's still fun every time, so, you know, that's what I like.
00:29:50 I play Nuclear Throne and Downwell for the same reasons.
00:29:53 They give me the same kind of thrill.
00:29:56 I don't like going down, I want to see things go up.
00:29:59 That's why I play RuneScape, classic to this day, because I like seeing numbers go up.
00:30:04 I got very tired of ever since Bloons Tower Defense, I permanently jaded myself to numbers.
00:30:14 That was my...
00:30:15 That's upsetting.
00:30:16 It was Bloons Tower's Defense, your 9-11 DeVue.
00:30:21 Yes.
00:30:22 I couldn't defend those towers.
00:30:25 Everyone has, like, some giant grind-em-up game that they played a million hours of,
00:30:29 but it's usually something famous, whereas mine was...
00:30:32 I have many of those.
00:30:34 Everyone has at least one.
00:30:36 That was my only one.
00:30:37 That's like the only game I've ever gotten big into the grind of,
00:30:40 just because instead of... I can't deal with, like, killing things all day,
00:30:44 but popping Bloons as a monkey or as a million monkeys is great.
00:30:48 So I've sunk between Bloons Tower...
00:30:50 This is relatable, right?
00:30:51 You say so.
00:30:52 Between Bloons Tower Defense 4 and 5, I've sunk about over a thousand hours,
00:30:56 which I know isn't that impressive by many people's standards, but...
00:30:59 Oh, my God.
00:31:00 Point was, that's how I got jaded to numbers, and now I don't care about numbers at all, hardly.
00:31:06 I'm sure I'll get back into them,
00:31:08 but for now, I like something like Nuclear Throne or Downwell,
00:31:12 where your numbers don't mean shit the moment you fuck up just a little bit and you die,
00:31:17 and you get to start back to zero, my favorite number.
00:31:20 Here's what I like.
00:31:22 Here's something I like about Nuclear Throne.
00:31:24 If you, like, fucking up, isn't that frustrating?
00:31:28 Because, like, in another game, like in Downwell, if I get hit early on,
00:31:32 I say fuck it, and I quit, and I restart, because messing up early on
00:31:36 is like you pay for it the whole game.
00:31:38 In Nuclear Throne, if I get, like, if I completely mess up and I'm, like,
00:31:42 ah, killed by an assassin, if I completely mess up and, like, get down to one health right away,
00:31:47 it's not really that hard to recover.
00:31:49 Oh, yeah.
00:31:50 Like, I play smart for a while.
00:31:51 Yeah, ironically, well, I guess it's not ironically.
00:31:54 Nuclear Throne is a lot less depressing than Downwell.
00:31:56 It's less oppressive than Downwell.
00:31:59 Yeah.
00:32:00 It's way more fun.
00:32:01 I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it way more than Downwell.
00:32:03 It's much more interesting looking and more fun to play and stuff.
00:32:06 Interesting look.
00:32:07 Dude, I love the aesthetic of Downwell.
00:32:08 Holy shit.
00:32:09 Oh, yeah, Downwell is great in its own way, but I do, like, Nuclear Throne more.
00:32:14 I think in terms of aesthetics, I would have to go with Downwell,
00:32:19 just because it's, I don't know, it's just a little more unique in its presentation.
00:32:22 Downwell has a more distinct and thick presentation,
00:32:27 and of course, you can pick your own palette.
00:32:28 Although, once I unlocked the Vivid palette, I was like,
00:32:32 this is the only palette I want.
00:32:34 If I had unlocked that before making my video on it,
00:32:36 that would have been like all the footage you would have seen.
00:32:39 Vivid? Which one's Vivid?
00:32:41 The best looking one. It's like, I don't know, it's like,
00:32:44 it's just the most pleasantly looking one.
00:32:46 I don't like any, I don't like any of the non-standard ones.
00:32:50 I think they're all inferior to the original.
00:32:53 Well, I guess they do kind of dilute the amount of your Innawell,
00:32:58 and it's dark, and there's things that shine.
00:33:01 I just make it harder for me to understand what's going on.
00:33:03 I can't believe I just figured that out.
00:33:05 The whole reason for Downwell's color scheme, how things are brighter on the top,
00:33:10 is because you're in a well and you're seeing the light from the top.
00:33:13 I can't believe I just realized that's why things are colored that way in Downwell.
00:33:17 Yeah, I guess that's kind of true.
00:33:19 Alright, well we'll discuss this more in depth in Downwell cast.
00:33:22 Going back to Nuclear Throne,
00:33:26 when meditating on 2015 games, and like, what's my favorite character from 2015?
00:33:30 Oh dude, we should totally do a Downwell cast.
00:33:32 I would be so up for that.
00:33:35 What's going on? Who's having a seizure?
00:33:39 I died.
00:33:40 I died in the freaking desert.
00:33:42 I died in loop 3-3 to Big Bad Man. Stupid.
00:33:49 I just died, I just died to the freaking, the big, the big bandit.
00:33:57 That's how distracted I'm getting, but at least I'm talking well.
00:34:01 Yes, I realized that the whole cast of Nuclear Throne is my favorite character from 2015.
00:34:07 I'm going to be a dang downer right now, because I honestly don't feel very much for the characters at all.
00:34:14 What's the big deal?
00:34:17 What's the big deal about the characters in Nuclear Throne?
00:34:21 They're just there.
00:34:24 They're mechanically different.
00:34:28 I read the Wiki, because I wanted to make sure I knew my stuff before making videos.
00:34:31 I read the Wiki, and they all have one paragraph bios.
00:34:34 With video game characters, I can judge them based on how they feel to play as.
00:34:40 That's how I judge video game characters.
00:34:43 It's like, as eyes, I can freaking pull stuff around.
00:34:47 And it's like, that's a cool character to be, and so I like him as a character.
00:34:52 Something very progressive, of course, that Nuclear Throne does is it has female characters that don't look female at all.
00:35:01 That was obviously something they went out of their way to do.
00:35:05 I mean, Crystal looks a little bit female.
00:35:09 Not hardly. I didn't think she was a girl.
00:35:12 No. That's not accurate.
00:35:16 Are you saying she looks totally female, or that she doesn't look at all?
00:35:20 I'm saying she looks like a rock.
00:35:22 Right, exactly.
00:35:23 And I think that they were trying to respond to the sentiment, not to the video itself,
00:35:30 but to the sentiment of one Jimquisition video where he pointed out, in his observation,
00:35:35 there's very few female characters in games who don't look attractive and don't have any motivations that are related to traditional woman-ish things.
00:35:44 Like, if they just want to be either or just want to make money or something.
00:35:48 I can appreciate it on the grounds that we take a generic looking character as assumed to be male,
00:35:58 but it doesn't have to be that way.
00:36:00 The generic one is the male, and the one with the bow on it is the girl.
00:36:06 Yeah, exactly.
00:36:07 But these characters are fucking monsters.
00:36:10 I do love the bow principle.
00:36:12 I love the idea that putting a bow on something makes it female.
00:36:15 I understand why Cartman understood that same principle.
00:36:17 But I can also love a game that doesn't do that.
00:36:21 And chicken obviously is a chicken, so it makes sense.
00:36:24 But then there's the one human character, the freaking rebel.
00:36:28 And what I loved is that rebel...
00:36:31 Well, it's cute.
00:36:32 It's cute and all, but I don't agree with it.
00:36:35 So I appreciate that nuclear throne goes out of its way to subvert it.
00:36:41 Yeah, well, I just actively enjoy that fact.
00:36:44 Hi, we're back.
00:36:45 The call kind of got broken up.
00:36:47 I was making a point about how rebel can help you confirm that you aren't racist,
00:36:54 because when I was looking at Rebel on the wiki,
00:36:58 I live in a place where almost everyone is white.
00:37:01 So if someone isn't white, I make a mental note,
00:37:03 like this person has this kind of hair, that kind of face,
00:37:06 and this is their skin color if they're not white.
00:37:08 One time I lived in Africa for a bit.
00:37:10 And you're saying that this helped you find out you're not racist?
00:37:13 It gave me a minute.
00:37:15 And so when I killed myself with my own buzz saw launcher,
00:37:19 it was a time I was in Africa, and if someone was white,
00:37:23 I made a mental note of them being white.
00:37:25 So that's just how you do it, that's just how you categorize things.
00:37:28 And when I was on the nuclear throne wiki,
00:37:30 I didn't even think about the fact that she was black because she was human,
00:37:34 and that stuck out to me more, you see?
00:37:36 So yeah.
00:37:37 Okay, when I was making that point originally...
00:37:39 I don't like her.
00:37:41 I don't like that she is such like a normal looking human
00:37:44 in a cast of like crazy monsters.
00:37:46 Now on the one hand, I can kind of appreciate that she's...
00:37:49 I can appreciate that she's like the control, you know?
00:37:53 Like everyone else is a horrible mutant,
00:37:55 and she's like the one normal one and sticks out for that.
00:37:58 And that's fine.
00:37:59 I think in-game she looks pretty good,
00:38:01 but her character art on the wiki looks really like,
00:38:04 really cartoony in a way that clashes with it.
00:38:06 You know, it's no wonder that nothing happens in your comic,
00:38:08 because you just hate ideas in general.
00:38:10 You know, just like anything that's like an idea,
00:38:12 you just don't like it,
00:38:13 and that's why your comic has nothing happening in it.
00:38:15 It's just characters sitting around.
00:38:17 Whoa!
00:38:18 Whoa!
00:38:19 Personal attacks, here we go.
00:38:21 Coming out swinging.
00:38:23 No, your comic is great.
00:38:24 Explain to me.
00:38:25 Your comic is great.
00:38:26 I want you to go more into depth with what you just said.
00:38:28 But first of all, I want to say that
00:38:30 when I was first making that point about Rebel,
00:38:32 that was when the call broke,
00:38:34 and so then I just thought you guys were like dead silent from awkwardness.
00:38:37 I'm like, oh no, this is not coming out right.
00:38:39 Oh God, I'm racist.
00:38:42 By the way, you're thinking of Rogue, not Rebel.
00:38:46 Oh wait, which one is, wait.
00:38:48 Rebel is the mummy.
00:38:49 Rebel is the one with allies.
00:38:52 How can a mummy be a rebel?
00:38:56 If they're a mummy, that means they died in royalty.
00:39:00 Because she's a bandit, dude.
00:39:04 She's a bandit, and her brother is a big bandit.
00:39:08 Don't you understand the deep, convoluted, deep-full, good, insightful,
00:39:16 insightful, progressive, deep-full.
00:39:21 Yeah, deep-full is my new game.
00:39:24 Deep-full just came out of early access.
00:39:26 What do you do?
00:39:27 Oh, everything is so deep-full.
00:39:29 It's a great story, and my favorite character is Undine.
00:39:36 She's my favorite character in this game.
00:39:38 I like to play as her, and let's stop talking about this now.
00:39:42 I never told you what my strats were.
00:39:45 Yeah.
00:39:46 No, you didn't.
00:39:47 But before you do, I'm hung up.
00:39:50 I'm hung up.
00:39:51 What did you mean, Davoo, when you said that I hate ideas?
00:39:54 Well, I don't know.
00:39:56 What did you mean?
00:39:57 I don't know your opinions enough.
00:39:58 I was just, that was like a random joke.
00:40:00 Obviously, your comic is great.
00:40:01 Okay, but what were you thinking that made?
00:40:06 I'm just not sure what that phrase means.
00:40:08 Well, disliking the fact that she's a human as the only human,
00:40:14 because for me, if I was in the creative department of Nuclear Throne,
00:40:18 I'd be like, all right, guys, we obviously want to have the one character who's human,
00:40:21 but where's an interesting costume and stuff.
00:40:23 That's the idea that I would have.
00:40:25 And so when you said you didn't like that as a concept,
00:40:28 I'm just trying to compile all the different negative opinions I've heard you say,
00:40:32 and I feel like just a wild guess.
00:40:34 There's a chain of ideas that you would probably want to include in something.
00:40:40 Like, oh, in a world where I want to monster have the one human.
00:40:43 That's a pretty obvious idea.
00:40:46 And so maybe, again, I have no idea if this is true,
00:40:50 you have a personal inclination against those kinds of ideas,
00:40:54 which is why you've decided to make this comic.
00:40:58 You told me that nothing happens in this comic that you're making, right?
00:41:02 Well, it's not that nothing happens.
00:41:05 It's a comic about nothing.
00:41:08 Right.
00:41:09 I'm just thinking maybe there's a connection.
00:41:14 But let me restate.
00:41:16 I think you're right.
00:41:17 I don't think it's actually, I have a problem with her being the only human,
00:41:22 but I really did not care for the big MLP eyes on her character art in the witty.
00:41:28 Maybe they could have toned it down enough.
00:41:30 I wasn't into it.
00:41:31 Maybe they could have toned it down a bit, but I love them,
00:41:33 because it like her eyes just beam out of every, you know, like her eye.
00:41:37 You can't see that much of her face, but what you can is mostly eyes.
00:41:40 Very adorable.
00:41:41 And, you know, she wears a giant costume.
00:41:44 And it's like, whoa.
00:41:45 It's like, even though she's human, she wears this crazy costume, you know?
00:41:49 She's like a ghostbuster.
00:41:52 Cool stuff.
00:41:54 There's one fundamental flaw in what you're saying right now.
00:41:58 There's one big flaw.
00:42:00 She's not a human.
00:42:01 She's an ape.
00:42:02 Oh, she's not human.
00:42:05 What is she?
00:42:08 What is she?
00:42:09 No, no, she is.
00:42:10 I called her an ape.
00:42:13 I called her an ape.
00:42:14 She's human.
00:42:15 Oh, sorry.
00:42:16 The call cut out in that part.
00:42:17 Oh.
00:42:18 The call cut out at just the right.
00:42:21 The call is cutting out all racism towards Rogue.
00:42:26 Munchy, let's hear your strats, because you're the only one who's a pro.
00:42:30 I've been waiting for this.
00:42:31 I've been waiting for this.
00:42:33 Oh, let me get inside my mecca, where I host all my ideas.
00:42:39 Please.
00:42:40 Idea number one.
00:42:41 I play as Rebels, so none of this applies to you.
00:42:43 Idea number two.
00:42:45 I only have two health mutations, because don't be a little bitch.
00:42:49 Number three.
00:42:51 Don't get your throne butt, but if you want to, you should get your throne butt.
00:42:56 Wow, that's a pretty...
00:42:59 That's kind of an irrelevant strategy.
00:43:01 Do it or don't.
00:43:04 Idea number three.
00:43:06 We need to get clean drinking water to Africa.
00:43:10 Idea number three.
00:43:12 We should innovate in car design.
00:43:14 We should innovate in nuclear throne, but in real life.
00:43:17 And most importantly, remember to have fun and be yourself.
00:43:22 Stop bullying.
00:43:23 I think bullying builds character.
00:43:27 Sure, but what kind of character?
00:43:29 Don't take this in a racial direction.
00:43:30 You're going to break the call again.
00:43:34 Believe me, it's not racial.
00:43:37 It's sexual, not in a sensual kind of way.
00:43:43 But in an inferiority kind of way.
00:43:47 Yeah.
00:43:49 Like you agree, right?
00:43:51 Of course.
00:43:52 DeVoo, on record, you agree with me, right?
00:43:54 No, I don't.
00:43:57 We had different opinions.
00:43:59 I'm going to edit the footage, so DeVoo is actually the one who's saying all that.
00:44:05 And I'm saying no, DeVoo, that's horrible.
00:44:07 Why would you say that?
00:44:09 It's the magic of video editing.
00:44:12 The magic of post-production.
00:44:14 Wait, do you guys have the game Sound On for yourselves?
00:44:17 Yeah.
00:44:18 I have it on very, very low.
00:44:19 What the heck am I doing?
00:44:20 Of course, this game is...
00:44:21 You need the sound to know what's happening.
00:44:23 Yeah.
00:44:24 But no wonder I've been stuck.
00:44:25 Yeah, you do.
00:44:27 That's one thing I do like about the game.
00:44:29 It's one game that forces me to have Sound On because of how much the sound helps, you know?
00:44:34 Yeah, it really does.
00:44:35 That's what I'm talking about when I say this game has good game feel.
00:44:37 Like, have the screen shakes whenever you shoot a bullet, and it's...
00:44:42 Binding of Isaac didn't have that shit.
00:44:45 No, sir.
00:44:46 Well, see, Flambier is like the god of that.
00:44:48 They're like the Sumerian god of creation.
00:44:50 That's what I heard when it comes to good games.
00:44:52 That's what you called chicken.
00:44:54 No, you called chicken a Sumerian god of destruction.
00:44:57 Yeah.
00:44:58 I'm seeing a strange logical through line in your comparisons in Flambier content.
00:45:03 Well, see, I myself am a Sumerian god, so it would make sense that I reference my content.
00:45:11 Sure.
00:45:12 This is going to be the best podcast on the face of the planet.
00:45:15 I was surprised how good it was for the first 20.
00:45:18 I guess it's actually coming out pretty good, given the nature of its production.
00:45:22 There are nugget.
00:45:23 There are definite nuggets in here that are good.
00:45:26 All right.
00:45:27 There's a lot of bugs.
00:45:29 Hopefully, the keyboard and mouse sounds will give people some ASMR.
00:45:33 Yeah.
00:45:34 Not with this microphone.
00:45:36 Just like Funky Kong taking you home from the airport.
00:45:38 Yes.
00:45:39 Everyone, stop watching this podcast or listening to a go watch ASMR Funky Kong.
00:45:47 Caring and supportive takes you home from the airport.
00:45:50 The best ASMR video I've yet seen.
00:45:53 Now, I was going to ask if that's a real thing, but I'm sure it is.
00:45:57 Yeah, it is.
00:45:58 Is it exactly what it sounds like?
00:46:00 Yes.
00:46:01 Okay.
00:46:02 It's much better.
00:46:03 It's much better.
00:46:04 Well, I want to see it.
00:46:05 It sounds great.
00:46:06 All right.
00:46:07 It sounds like a real edifying experience.
00:46:08 I see more characters that are cool.
00:46:11 I guess...
00:46:12 Yeah, let me go back to...
00:46:14 I don't get what it is about the characters that's so great because I don't know anything
00:46:18 about them.
00:46:19 Honestly, the game doesn't give them much personality aside from the mechanical ways
00:46:25 they play.
00:46:26 That's not entirely true, but I agree with what you're trying to pick at.
00:46:30 That does say a lot about the character, but...
00:46:33 They're tooltips, dude.
00:46:35 Yeah, they become...
00:46:36 I get to become them, so that's why they're cool.
00:46:38 Yeah, I guess they have character-specific tooltips.
00:46:40 Okay.
00:46:41 Well, yeah, I have noticed a bunch of character-specific tooltips, but they haven't really told me
00:46:47 anything about Crystal.
00:46:49 Oh, yeah.
00:46:50 That's because they don't like Crystal because she's not cool.
00:46:53 Oh.
00:46:54 I mean, she said something about family, and she keeps...
00:46:57 She says, like, oh, it's not right.
00:46:59 It's not fair.
00:47:00 What does that mean?
00:47:01 Okay, you know the school of characterization where you only come up with a...
00:47:06 You only explain a couple of details, and the rest of it is your imagination welling
00:47:10 up with a bunch of ideas for the details.
00:47:13 Obviously, you can't just do that and automatically make it work.
00:47:17 It has to be...
00:47:18 The couple of details that you do expose it have to be done just right for that to work,
00:47:22 and for me, Nuclear Throne, that totally works.
00:47:25 And also the way that the characters feel together.
00:47:28 If there was a game that only had one of them or only three of them, it wouldn't be nearly
00:47:32 as cool as the fact that they're all together.
00:47:35 And I'm looking at the character select screen, and they're all at the campfire.
00:47:39 They all feel like they're part of the same mission in a way.
00:47:42 They all go out on their own to get to the Nuclear Throne independently, but there's this
00:47:47 moment where they're all at the campfire together, getting ready to get going.
00:47:51 I agree with that.
00:47:52 They are a very diverse and colorful cast, but they're also all very unified in their
00:47:57 design, so I think that's pretty sweet.
00:47:59 I love stuff like that.
00:48:00 Which is maybe why Rebel, I think, I didn't care for her.
00:48:04 Rogue!
00:48:05 Rogue, because she stands out a little.
00:48:07 I'm just...
00:48:08 Yeah, I'm the trendsetter.
00:48:12 Yeah, but I'm with you on that front.
00:48:16 I mean, look, obviously there was probably some bunch of games out there with better
00:48:21 character casts than Nuclear Throne that came out this year.
00:48:24 I just haven't played a whole lot of games this year.
00:48:27 What game could possibly have a more diverse character cast than this?
00:48:32 There's a skeleton from this game?
00:48:34 Did you know that?
00:48:36 Oh yeah, I do know that, yeah.
00:48:38 Which is kind of weird, because isn't it melting like almost a skeleton?
00:48:41 Yeah, but it's not always halfway to being a skeleton.
00:48:43 He's almost a skeleton, that's pretty cool.
00:48:45 I don't really play him.
00:48:47 Almost.
00:48:48 He's halfway in his evolution from man to skeleton.
00:48:53 The natural end point of all life.
00:48:59 Well, I mean, I wasn't sure if you were baiting this response to Voo, but Undertale had a pretty
00:49:04 diverse cast.
00:49:05 I was baiting the response.
00:49:06 Yeah, that had, you know...
00:49:07 Well, what I love about the Undertale characters is the way that they're written in this.
00:49:10 Other than Flowey and especially Sans, those are characters I like.
00:49:14 I think about how cool those characters are independently of the game themselves.
00:49:18 But what I love about the characters in Undertale is how they work with the story and with each other
00:49:23 and all the other elements.
00:49:25 Whereas the cast of Nuclear Throne, obviously the way that they fit with the game is great,
00:49:31 but also their own aesthetic does make me feel like...
00:49:34 I don't know, it's the kind of thing where I could be walking around and be like,
00:49:37 oh man, I wish I had eyes, powers, and I could drag that towards me.
00:49:41 I mean, if this killed me, I sure would like to be able to run around for five seconds
00:49:44 and try to get my life back.
00:49:46 Uh... I guess, I mean...
00:49:50 Whereas I never go around thinking wishing I was a gay fish, like Kanye West or Rondine.
00:49:57 I think that every second of my life, every second of my life, no matter what action...
00:50:03 Why has no one done an undying gay fish AMV yet?
00:50:06 That's a crime.
00:50:09 I don't understand the reference.
00:50:11 There's an episode of South Park where they come up with a joke where they go,
00:50:15 the joke, Jimmy comes up with a joke, the joke is this, do you like fish dicks?
00:50:20 Yes, I like fish dicks.
00:50:21 He goes, what are you, a gay fish?
00:50:24 Everyone in the world loves the joke except Kanye West who doesn't get that it's a joke
00:50:28 and he thinks that people are accusing him of being a gay fish.
00:50:31 Then at the end of the episode, after he tries to get to the bottom of this,
00:50:35 he realizes they must be telling the truth, I must actually be a gay fish.
00:50:39 So he sings a song about him being a gay fish,
00:50:41 and he goes into the water and makes that with a bunch of male fish and then drowns.
00:50:45 And I just don't know why no one has done an AMV with that song to undine yet.
00:50:50 Uh... sounds like a great idea, you should get on it.
00:50:54 Maybe because we're not, we're not, we're above that as a culture.
00:50:59 Maybe we're 2,000 years of culture into the civilization,
00:51:03 and we don't need to degrade ourselves like that anymore to do.
00:51:07 Maybe this is an ancient Rome, where that kind of thing would be acceptable.
00:51:13 Yeah, well, I don't know.
00:51:15 Maybe we've finally moved past our perverse societal need to mash up things with other things.
00:51:23 No, man.
00:51:26 I've been putting on that Biggie Smalls Thomas tank engine mash up every day.
00:51:31 It's like one of the first things I do when I wake up.
00:51:34 As much as I wish I didn't like Space Jam remixes, they never get old.
00:51:40 They have yet to get old.
00:51:42 The best one is the Space Jam theme.
00:51:45 The little John one in Lazy Town, that one I'll never do that one.
00:51:49 Well, that one's only like a minute and a half long.
00:51:51 I like the mash-ups that go on for a while.
00:51:55 Yeah, it is pretty great though.
00:51:57 I better make a pretty cake.
00:51:59 What?
00:52:01 If the way's hazy, gotta do the cooking by the book.
00:52:06 Okay.
00:52:08 No one can do that voice though, that's the problem.
00:52:11 I've gone three disc guns on this one level alone.
00:52:16 I hate disc guns.
00:52:18 Why do they're good, dude?
00:52:20 They fucking kill you.
00:52:21 They die when you use a disc.
00:52:23 I like weapons that are dangerous.
00:52:27 No man, I've gotten to the point, back to actually talking about Nuclear Throne.
00:52:32 I've gotten to a point where I don't even pick up the good weapons
00:52:37 because they're too fucking dangerous.
00:52:39 Grenade launchers, I mean I can mostly handle a grenade launcher.
00:52:42 You're extremely wrong in your assessment that grenade launcher is a good weapon.
00:52:49 Okay, fine.
00:52:50 But I mean the stronger weapons, the more deadly ones.
00:52:54 Explosives basically is what I'm getting at.
00:52:56 I really like the flare gun because the flare gun can't kill you.
00:52:59 Oh my fucking god!
00:53:01 What?
00:53:02 I've never seen a human being so unsophisticated as you.
00:53:06 What's wrong with the flare gun?
00:53:08 It does one damage, ever.
00:53:11 That's not true, I have killed Snow-Mex with it in one shot.
00:53:15 Snow-Mex are way weaker than they look.
00:53:17 That's the weird thing about Snow-Mex, did they originally have more health
00:53:21 and they decided to nerf them?
00:53:23 Because they die so much quicker than you think they would.
00:53:26 Everything in Snowtown dies faster than I expected.
00:53:31 I go in there with heavy crossbows because everything's so big and intimidating
00:53:35 but then I went in with a revolver.
00:53:37 All I need to do is just put rust textures on all the enemies,
00:53:41 make them all look rusty.
00:53:43 Therefore, they would be more weak and easily deadified.
00:53:47 Dentified?
00:53:49 I feel like they do have some rust, don't they?
00:53:52 They might.
00:53:53 But they still look really scary and they just don't live up to that.
00:53:58 Have you ever seen one of the golden snow tanks?
00:54:00 Yes.
00:54:01 Oh yeah, sure.
00:54:02 Good, good.
00:54:03 I've gotten to the snow zone pretty often.
00:54:07 Quite a number of times.
00:54:09 I can't wait until you finally die to an Explodofreak in the labs.
00:54:14 I can't wait for that moment.
00:54:16 It'll be like you've all grown up.
00:54:18 I don't think I've ever died in the labs.
00:54:20 Good job.
00:54:21 I'm sure because once you get past Little Hunter you're in excellent mode,
00:54:24 you're in I gotta not die mode, you know?
00:54:26 Because you're in a rare state of success.
00:54:30 Little Hunter is so fucking easy.
00:54:32 I'm always so fucking terrified when I get to the labs
00:54:36 that I go wicked slowly and peek slowly around every corner
00:54:40 and launch all my bombs ahead of me just because I don't want to take any chances.
00:54:46 To the whole reason, one of the things that makes me really low...
00:54:49 I know why you're not doing well is because you're using Explosive Weapons.
00:54:54 Well I've stopped using Explosive Weapons because I'm too scared of them now.
00:54:58 See, it's sort of...
00:54:59 Because they just kill me every time.
00:55:01 Well not every time.
00:55:04 Honestly, I've gotten...
00:55:07 Oh fuck, Mad Dog just exploded and killed me because I'm stupid.
00:55:11 Speaking of dying and explosions.
00:55:13 No, I'm pretty good with grenade launchers.
00:55:15 But like, yeah, disc guns kill me every time.
00:55:21 Anything...
00:55:23 I got a nuke launcher against the nuclear throne once.
00:55:27 It didn't kill me?
00:55:30 What?
00:55:31 No, that's a good weapon.
00:55:32 That's unironically not misleading, that's a good weapon.
00:55:36 Yeah, it dropped in the throne room and I picked it up and I was just like firing nukes.
00:55:41 I got off like seven or eight of them before I was murdered by green bullets.
00:55:46 I have a gold one of those, say in my loadout screen for YP and it's very fun to get out sometimes.
00:55:52 Because you know, it may be kind of weird that I like this game so much.
00:55:56 I give it like a nine, even though I haven't really gotten that close to beating it.
00:56:01 I'm not that good at it.
00:56:03 But the reason I love it so much is that I can love it without having to be good at it.
00:56:08 I don't know.
00:56:10 I mean, I know what you mean, but I'm not like that.
00:56:12 For me, the whole draw of the game is the tension that it creates between just how badly I want to beat it.
00:56:20 So if I never beat nuclear throne, I will be pissed for the rest of my life.
00:56:26 I mean, up to doing my review of it, my video on it, I was like, there were many play sessions.
00:56:33 I'd be like, alright, time to focus.
00:56:35 But the play sessions in which I try to focus don't necessarily end up better than the ones where I try to focus just a little bit.
00:56:41 I mean, obviously, if I wanted to do a decent job, I wouldn't be doing a podcast while playing it.
00:56:48 Oh gosh.
00:56:50 Well, see, I feel the same way like I can't be laid back.
00:56:54 The thing with video games and getting great at them is that when I get great at them,
00:56:59 then I feel like, well, I'm done.
00:57:01 I can't get quite the same level of engagement.
00:57:04 But with nuclear throne since it always goes on forever and ever,
00:57:07 then I will never feel like I'm about to hit that limit of goodness.
00:57:11 I guess once you get to like, you're fired or something.
00:57:13 The game ends when you get a world record.
00:57:15 That's when the game ends.
00:57:17 Well, no, because the game has to end when you get a world record and then the world ends,
00:57:21 so you know no one else will ever get that record.
00:57:23 Yeah, exactly.
00:57:25 So the real goal, you're saying that the real goal of nuclear throne is first get the world record
00:57:29 and then destroy the world.
00:57:31 Getting the world record and nuclear throne is only the beginning.
00:57:35 But you can only destroy it by building a nuclear throne that will destroy the entire world
00:57:39 and cause the events of nuclear throne to happen.
00:57:42 The goal of nuclear throne is to bring about nuclear throne in real life.
00:57:48 And you'd be so good at surviving in that world because you know.
00:57:51 Yeah, exactly.
00:57:52 So you become like the top.
00:57:58 I mean, I'm sure there's an explanation for this in the game, but I don't know it.
00:58:02 But I guess in this fantasy world, we're creating...
00:58:04 Wait, which level of the scrapyard is the car in?
00:58:10 Oh, one. It's always in one.
00:58:12 Crud, I passed it and I had to screw it over, whatever.
00:58:15 I'll get it someday.
00:58:17 I think it spawns in all other stuff.
00:58:20 No, no, no.
00:58:22 Man, it sucks not having a melee weapon that pulls back bullets when I get to the big dog.
00:58:28 That's the most funnest thing about the big dog is that I can hit all of his bullets back at him.
00:58:33 That is pretty fun.
00:58:34 Luckily, I died by the way.
00:58:36 I'm not really...
00:58:38 Man, it sure feels good to be a man and not be a little baby.
00:58:42 A little baby crystal player.
00:58:45 It's just so...
00:58:48 It's just the shield is just so indispensable.
00:58:51 I got an auto crossbow and bolt marrow.
00:58:53 We have a run, boys.
00:58:55 Oh, fuck.
00:58:56 I never take the weapon-specific upgrades because I don't feel like committing.
00:59:02 Well, see, you always take two in a run.
00:59:04 Yeah, I actually do.
00:59:06 I guess it's like...
00:59:07 What's that?
00:59:08 What were you saying, Munchie?
00:59:09 You always take two in a run.
00:59:10 Unless you are like a melee user and then you have to always take long arms and laser brain.
00:59:19 Why laser brain?
00:59:20 Oh, shit.
00:59:21 You people don't know.
00:59:22 Oh, nigga.
00:59:23 So what were the upgrades you said you had?
00:59:26 How about laser brain?
00:59:27 In four dash...
00:59:28 Actually, they might have changed it.
00:59:30 I mean, I know that there is like some upgrade that you only get if you get two...
00:59:36 Are you going to tell us about that special mutation?
00:59:38 There's a weapon that drops in 5-1.
00:59:43 What?
00:59:46 Yeah.
00:59:47 There's an energy sword in this game and it's the best weapon in the game.
00:59:51 Oh, I think I saw that.
00:59:52 I've watched playthroughs of that.
00:59:54 Man, I want to get good just so I can get those freaking weapons, man.
00:59:58 I think I saw it one time but didn't get to pick it up.
01:00:00 Well, see, it drops in 5-1, I'm pretty sure.
01:00:05 It's not like a late game weapon.
01:00:07 Oh.
01:00:08 Well.
01:00:09 Yeah.
01:00:10 So if you can get that laser brain in long arms and preferably trigger fingers, but you
01:00:16 don't need that specifically, then you won't die.
01:00:21 I do love melee with trigger fingers.
01:00:23 So the laser sword is in level 5-1.
01:00:25 How do you get it?
01:00:27 Well, no.
01:00:28 It's not a guaranteed drop.
01:00:29 Oh, okay.
01:00:30 It may show up all right.
01:00:32 I wish it was because when I saw that I'm like, well, I want that, man.
01:00:36 Oh.
01:00:37 Well, see, the thing is, the reason it's so good is because you can swing so fast.
01:00:41 Yeah.
01:00:42 And so much damage just builds up over time.
01:00:45 And all the high tier weapons are, well, not high, well, yeah.
01:00:50 All the high tier weapons in pretty much every class are energy.
01:00:56 So you might as well be picking up laser brain anyway.
01:00:58 I just want to be able to kill the enemies as fast as possible.
01:01:00 My favorite character for nuclear throne is just to be the dev and just open up the game
01:01:04 file and just hit, just control A all the enemies in the room and hit delete.
01:01:08 Yeah.
01:01:09 That's my favorite too.
01:01:11 A super splitter gun.
01:01:12 Oh, Nick.
01:01:13 Oh, no.
01:01:16 Oh, Nick, are we in there?
01:01:19 Why do the levels load to 101% or more?
01:01:22 Because it's cool, dude.
01:01:24 Yeah, that's pretty cool.
01:01:26 Munchy.
01:01:27 Yeah?
01:01:28 I know that there is a, there's an up, or there's a mutation that you can only get
01:01:32 if you have two weapons specific upgrades.
01:01:36 It's three, actually.
01:01:37 What's up with that?
01:01:38 Oh, okay.
01:01:39 What's up with that?
01:01:40 It's heavy heart and you get more weapon drops.
01:01:44 Is it good?
01:01:45 No.
01:01:46 Oh.
01:01:47 Well, all right.
01:01:48 There's no reason for it to be in the game.
01:01:52 I am not capable of focusing on the game enough to play well when I'm also talking.
01:01:57 So, unfortunately, my social tendencies override my game tendencies.
01:02:02 So, not going to be able to do well.
01:02:04 And if I was trying to do well, I still wouldn't do well.
01:02:06 I would still lose to Little Hunter.
01:02:08 So, actually, I'm pretty sure if I encounter him another couple of times,
01:02:12 eventually I'll get him because I understand that it's probably better philosophy to just
01:02:16 run right at him and start swinging.
01:02:18 That seems to have better odds than running, which is what I was doing before.
01:02:21 I'm going to tell you like Game Dude, like Nintendo, like Power Nintendo,
01:02:26 Good, Ultra, Guy Fieri, Power Breakfast, like a tip.
01:02:31 Okay.
01:02:32 Sure.
01:02:33 Pick up the jackhammer and fight Little Hunter.
01:02:37 You know what?
01:02:38 I had the jackhammer and honestly it didn't do that well against Little Hunter.
01:02:42 I don't know why everyone says that.
01:02:43 Why does the jackhammer help Little Hunter?
01:02:45 I remember hearing that, too.
01:02:46 Ben.
01:02:47 Ben, is it possible that you are an escaped mental patient
01:02:51 and you shouldn't be out with us normal humans?
01:02:54 He was...
01:02:55 I kept trying to hit him with it and he would just like jump away
01:02:58 and I would only get like one or two shots on it.
01:03:00 I know, but you'd have to keep doing that.
01:03:02 Well, yeah.
01:03:04 You could do that with other weapons.
01:03:06 I know, but it's safe and easy.
01:03:08 I'm just saying this for DeVoo because he needs medical assistance.
01:03:12 Maybe.
01:03:13 He's fallen.
01:03:14 I guess.
01:03:15 Medical assistance.
01:03:16 I guess I haven't really tried the jackhammer.
01:03:18 Whenever I picked it up, I'm like,
01:03:19 I don't want to use this and I put it back down.
01:03:21 I should give him more of a chance.
01:03:22 Yeah, something about it.
01:03:24 I picked it up one time.
01:03:26 I've used it like once because I knew Little Hunter was coming up
01:03:29 and I heard it was good against him and it was okay.
01:03:32 And once because I was out of ammo on my other gun
01:03:36 and there was a jackhammer there and I was like,
01:03:37 oh, okay, and I took it.
01:03:39 And I don't know, I didn't like it.
01:03:41 It felt like the flamethrower, which I also don't like.
01:03:45 And it just expends a lot of ammo really fast
01:03:49 for not a whole lot of payoff.
01:03:52 I didn't feel like it was doing huge damage or anything.
01:03:55 No, see, the thing is it's not.
01:03:56 A lot of melee weapons aren't weapons and more tools for you to use.
01:04:02 And I feel like the jackhammer's not a good weapon,
01:04:05 but it saves your ass a lot of the time.
01:04:07 Like the Throne 2 just gets destroyed by...
01:04:10 Oh, shit.
01:04:12 Forget I said that.
01:04:15 Okay.
01:04:17 There isn't a Throne 2.
01:04:19 No, why would there be?
01:04:21 Why would there be a new End Boss on subsequent playthroughs?
01:04:25 Are you trying to avoid spoilers here?
01:04:28 No, I don't want to do this broadcast again.
01:04:31 I saw it and I don't want to do it.
01:04:34 Then why is he so aggro?
01:04:36 I'm going to be on the level!
01:04:38 Oh, but I was going to say, yeah, Little Hunter,
01:04:41 I feel like I'm just starting to get to a point
01:04:45 where I kind of have a handle on what to do with Little Hunter.
01:04:48 I think I've faced, I don't know, maybe a dozen times now,
01:04:51 and I'm just starting to not be overwhelmed and terrified by his very presence.
01:04:57 Little Hunter is my BGSM sub.
01:05:00 You're what?
01:05:02 Nothing to do.
01:05:03 Gross.
01:05:05 But it's accurate.
01:05:08 He seems pretty, he seems pretty dumb to me.
01:05:11 Oh, that's what we were saying.
01:05:13 Gotcha.
01:05:14 Well, I mean, see, well, I think the most effective weapon,
01:05:20 and this is probably just the most effective weapon period,
01:05:23 but on Little Hunter, the Super Crossbow,
01:05:25 if you have that, then just shoot him once in his bed.
01:05:28 Well, that sounds good.
01:05:30 Because you know, when I see the Crossbow upgrade option,
01:05:34 I'm like, okay, if I have the Crossbow, I'll always pick it,
01:05:37 because yeah, you know, the one that makes the aiming better,
01:05:40 and then sometimes I'll be like, you know what,
01:05:42 I want to get the Crossbow.
01:05:43 I like the feeling of a Crossbow.
01:05:45 I like the feeling of like weapons that are light,
01:05:47 but do a lot of damage.
01:05:48 Like revolvers in some games are like way more powerful
01:05:51 than like freaking shotguns or something.
01:05:54 Yeah, the Crossbow feels really good.
01:05:55 Yeah, it's my favorite sword and weapon in any game like ever.
01:05:59 Yeah, it just feels really good to like carefully aim a shot
01:06:04 that does like ridiculous damage.
01:06:06 It feels great.
01:06:07 But there's a late game revolver that's like fucking beautiful,
01:06:11 and I love it.
01:06:12 Is it the Super Revolver?
01:06:14 No, there isn't a Super.
01:06:15 Well, I'll just tell you this, I don't care anymore.
01:06:18 It's an Ultra Revolver.
01:06:21 Ultra.
01:06:22 Is that the one that takes rads?
01:06:26 Yep.
01:06:27 Is that the one that you spend rads?
01:06:28 I should do an analysis of revolvers,
01:06:30 and it'll just be my memories with revolvers.
01:06:33 I've never touched a real revolver,
01:06:35 but my memories with games and revolvers,
01:06:37 like playing Clue, obviously.
01:06:39 But my fondest memories of revolvers is in Fallout 3,
01:06:42 because I really, that was like the 44 revolver in that game
01:06:45 was my favorite weapon.
01:06:46 Because again, it's so tiny, but it does quite a bit of damage.
01:06:49 And then when I got into cheats on Fallout 3,
01:06:53 there's one cheat you can get to give yourself a revolver
01:06:56 that doesn't have a scope.
01:06:58 And for some reason, that revolver does over 5,000 damage.
01:07:04 And so, like a super mutant behemoth would come,
01:07:07 and I insta-killed him with a revolver.
01:07:09 And I would just go through the whole game
01:07:11 insta-killing absolutely everything with my revolver,
01:07:14 and it was the greatest time.
01:07:16 So whenever, and I recently played Half-Life,
01:07:18 and so I shot down, like, telekinetic aliens with a revolver,
01:07:24 I don't have to cross, though.
01:07:26 Revolvers are always a special time in video games.
01:07:30 Well, the crossbow in Half-Life is pretty rad.
01:07:33 Oh, shit.
01:07:34 Revolver quest.
01:07:35 Revolver quest.
01:07:36 Yeah, man.
01:07:38 Oh, this gold scorpion fucked me up.
01:07:41 Oh, yeah, I hate those.
01:07:43 They're dead.
01:07:45 I'm gonna try to try to do well enough to get YV.
01:07:50 All right, yeah, this is no more baby bullshit mode.
01:07:52 We're just gonna go silent.
01:07:54 I guess.
01:07:56 No, man.
01:07:57 That's missing the forest for the trees.
01:08:01 I don't even know what that means.
01:08:02 Oh, right.
01:08:03 At some point, I accidentally dropped my freaking screwdriver.
01:08:07 When did I drop my screwdriver?
01:08:09 So I'm killing a big hunter, I mean, a big bandit,
01:08:13 just by, I killed big bandit just by throwing my wrench
01:08:17 out of a bunch of times as chicken.
01:08:19 That was pretty funny.
01:08:20 Yeah, that is good.
01:08:22 There's a bug in this game where if you have a melee weapon
01:08:24 and you hit big bandit as soon as he charges,
01:08:27 you can hit him 47 times.
01:08:31 Huh.
01:08:32 Well, unfortunately, I somehow dropped my screwdriver.
01:08:39 So I guess I'll have to get it again.
01:08:42 Well, it sucks because I would never get a screwdriver
01:08:46 for any other reason because it negates everything
01:08:49 that I like about melee weapons.
01:08:51 Yeah.
01:08:52 Oh, here's something I like to do.
01:08:54 It's as chicken if I have the wrench as I do right now,
01:08:56 I'll switch between my blade and my wrench
01:08:59 to be able to rapid-fire hit things.
01:09:01 Yeah, that does not sound cool.
01:09:02 That is the coolest.
01:09:03 I guess it makes sense.
01:09:04 I don't know how practical it is,
01:09:05 but it's a fun thing to pull off.
01:09:08 No, man.
01:09:09 You said, I said before, trigger fingers.
01:09:11 Trigger fingering with melee just feels so great here.
01:09:16 Yeah, you run up to something and just smash them
01:09:19 and kill them and then because you got trigger fingers,
01:09:21 you can just run right up to the next one and whack it again
01:09:23 and just keep whacking.
01:09:24 And you guys ever played Geometry Wars?
01:09:27 That's like the ultimate in games
01:09:29 where you feel like you're mowing through enemies
01:09:31 where enemies are grass and you are a mower.
01:09:34 If you like trigger figures, play Geometry Wars.
01:09:39 It's where the enemies will cluster up in a cluster
01:09:42 and you just, your bullets eat into them.
01:09:45 Like it's eating through a wall of enemies
01:09:48 that are slowly being eradicated.
01:09:50 That is pretty cool.
01:09:52 Like that fight against a thousand heartless
01:09:54 in Kingdom Hearts 2.
01:09:55 Or maybe there were nobody to do whatever.
01:09:57 Freaking Geometry Wars needs to come back as a roguelike.
01:10:00 As like a steam-friendly roguelike.
01:10:02 Because the problem with Geometry Wars
01:10:04 is I don't like the level structure of it that much.
01:10:07 The roguelike setup can make the game
01:10:11 constantly challenging and engaging forever basically.
01:10:14 And I'm glad that it's a trend that's catching on so much.
01:10:18 It is a good thing.
01:10:19 I really like the roguelike elements.
01:10:22 So yeah, Geometry Wars needs to come back as a roguelike.
01:10:26 I mean, do we need like a new sub-genre signifier
01:10:30 for like the specific type of roguelike
01:10:32 that Downwell and Nuclear Throne are?
01:10:34 Mystery Dungeon. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon.
01:10:37 No. Procedural Death Labyrinth.
01:10:40 PDL for sure.
01:10:41 Because like Nuclear Throne feels a little bit more arcade-like.
01:10:45 There's almost like an arcade-y feel to it.
01:10:48 Which makes it like the only type of arcade-y games
01:10:51 that I really, really like.
01:10:54 I like video games that are video-game-y.
01:10:57 Yeah.
01:10:58 I do too.
01:10:59 Dude, you just hit my sweet spot, yeah.
01:11:03 Like, yeah, like...
01:11:06 Yeah, like, yeah.
01:11:08 I haven't played Mass Effect.
01:11:10 But games like Mass Effect seem inherently kind of unappealing.
01:11:14 Like, I don't feel much drive to play games like that
01:11:17 that are like about their stories.
01:11:19 Interesting.
01:11:20 Exclusively.
01:11:21 Well, I haven't played Mass Effect.
01:11:22 I mean, I know that's an overstatement.
01:11:23 It is a game and it has gameplay and stuff.
01:11:26 But I don't know.
01:11:28 Something about a game that is all about its mechanics
01:11:31 and the moment-to-moment feel of the game.
01:11:34 It's got a heavy crossbow.
01:11:35 It's really great.
01:11:37 Swapped up.
01:11:38 I love the heavy crossbow.
01:11:39 I don't know how many times I've had the heavy crossbow.
01:11:45 But specifically what's great about Trigger Fingers and Melee
01:11:47 is that it's that feeling that you're swinging faster
01:11:53 than you should be able to
01:11:54 and you have to keep chaining them to be able to keep doing it.
01:11:57 And so like, your window to hit...
01:11:59 Oh, the blue one.
01:12:00 Your window of opportunity to kill the next one is shortened
01:12:03 and you have to jump on it.
01:12:05 It's like you're on the edge of your seat.
01:12:07 It's like this tense thing where you have to chain them together
01:12:10 to achieve maximum deadliness.
01:12:12 Yes.
01:12:13 And your offense, your strong offense becomes your best defense
01:12:18 because you just got to keep killing.
01:12:20 And if you stop killing for a second, then they'll kill you.
01:12:23 Yeah, man.
01:12:25 Okay, the combination of my chicken sword and my heavy crossbow,
01:12:29 I'm getting into that vicious Rambo Mode.
01:12:37 Dang it, I got nothing but crap upgrades.
01:12:39 I have Lucky Shot and I have Strong Spirit, Hammerhead,
01:12:44 and Extra Feet.
01:12:46 Strong Spirit's not bad.
01:12:48 It says prevent death once, but I've never noticed it preventing death.
01:12:53 Maybe I'm not understanding it.
01:12:55 Well, it just lets you take one extra hit, basically.
01:12:58 That's weird.
01:12:59 And Hammerhead, going through a limited number of walls,
01:13:03 I only picked once and forgot that I picked it,
01:13:06 and it threw me off constantly.
01:13:09 It was really distracting that I was eating through walls,
01:13:12 and I was like, what?
01:13:14 So it's nice to know that you can do a whole strategy
01:13:17 that involves manipulating the walls to create your own cover and stuff.
01:13:23 I feel like that's kind of like Crystal's Throne Butt
01:13:28 in that it's probably really good in the hands of someone
01:13:30 who really knows what to do with it.
01:13:32 Who likes to go play the Worms games or something.
01:13:36 I don't know, just someone who has a plan,
01:13:39 who's like, yes, if I can eat through walls,
01:13:41 I would do this for my strategy, but I don't know what to do with it.
01:13:45 Alright, I'm back with a sandwich. What did I miss?
01:13:48 We were just talking about Hammerhead.
01:13:51 Yes, Hammerhead is good.
01:13:53 You think so? What do you do with Hammerhead?
01:13:56 Well, see, I don't use it offensively.
01:13:58 If you get a bad spawn, you can just dig into the wall behind you
01:14:01 and you can use it as a shield.
01:14:03 Yeah, okay, so you can funnel enemies towards you through your tunnel?
01:14:07 Well, that too, but also just make a little cove.
01:14:11 Spawns get especially bad on loops,
01:14:13 where you will spawn in a big room full of enemies,
01:14:16 so you have to make a little bit of a safe space for you.
01:14:21 I'll say, because what I was talking about
01:14:24 was how going through a limited number of walls
01:14:28 made me think that there would be a lot of strategy
01:14:30 involving creating cover for yourself and stuff like that,
01:14:33 where there would be more spatial tactics that you could employ.
01:14:38 One thing that was a little disappointing about Nuclear Throne
01:14:42 is that I was thinking there was going to be people
01:14:45 who would be specializing in careful runs of the game,
01:14:49 but then I look at the top runs and it's all run into the middle of the action.
01:14:53 So I framed that as a positive thing in my video
01:14:56 that it encourages you to go crazy mode,
01:14:59 but I think it would be cool if there were incentives to do careful mode,
01:15:03 and there's no scoring in this game, right?
01:15:07 Okay, yeah.
01:15:08 I think all you have to do is create some sort of scoring system where...
01:15:13 No, there is.
01:15:14 Oh, there is? Okay.
01:15:17 Monchi, should I get the flat cannon?
01:15:19 Yeah, yeah.
01:15:22 Do you have a strike on the shoulders?
01:15:24 No.
01:15:26 If no, don't, then don't.
01:15:28 Well, I'm in the freaking Diamond Spider Zone
01:15:31 for the first time in this podcast.
01:15:34 I finally made it this far.
01:15:36 God help you.
01:15:38 I mean, I usually get here pretty consistently.
01:15:40 I've looped five times since we've started this.
01:15:43 Wow.
01:15:46 Anyway, I think maybe one of the modifications you can make to the game
01:15:50 to encourage careful runs
01:15:52 is that you get higher combos of your points.
01:15:56 Like, your point ratio goes up significantly
01:15:59 if you don't get hit at all.
01:16:02 So there's a multiplier for your points
01:16:04 if you don't take any damage.
01:16:06 That would incentivize careful runs.
01:16:10 I just died on the Crystal Spider.
01:16:12 Basically, it means if you do a careful run,
01:16:14 it will take way longer to get to the top loops, you know?
01:16:17 But then you could do,
01:16:19 you could get more points that way.
01:16:21 That way, your objective in a careful run
01:16:23 would be to get the highest score
01:16:24 rather than to loop the highest number of times
01:16:26 or to beat your speed record.
01:16:29 So yeah, so you could do speed records
01:16:32 versus point records, and one would be careful.
01:16:35 Right, because then you can really get a lot of advantage
01:16:37 out of stuff like running through the walls,
01:16:40 using grenades to manipulate the walls.
01:16:42 That's such a good idea that I just had.
01:16:45 I must preach into the heavens
01:16:47 and post this podcast everywhere.
01:16:49 Let's get Vlambeer in this podcast.
01:16:51 Hey, Vlambeer, how you doing?
01:16:53 What do you think about video games?
01:16:55 I do not speak English.
01:16:58 Does he not speak English?
01:17:00 Where's he from?
01:17:02 He's from Sweden, I think.
01:17:04 Well, good for him.
01:17:06 You know what's funny is that you guys were talking about
01:17:08 how great it feels to have the screen shaking,
01:17:10 like, within five minutes, first booting up on me.
01:17:12 Oh, no. What?
01:17:14 Oh, no.
01:17:16 Please, yeah, come on, it's awesome.
01:17:18 I'll turn it back on. It's not like I was super opposed to it.
01:17:20 I'll just...
01:17:22 You know what put it back on?
01:17:24 Max.
01:17:26 I don't know what level I have it on.
01:17:28 I have it on whatever the default is.
01:17:30 Wow, it's like the whole freaking screen chugged.
01:17:32 Maybe it'll make me better. I just figured it would make me worse,
01:17:34 but if it...
01:17:36 It just feels awesome.
01:17:38 I didn't really get mage to play Nuclear Throne.
01:17:40 I knew she wouldn't because I know it's not her kind of game,
01:17:42 but I was making my case for it
01:17:44 and she went and looked up a video for it
01:17:46 and she said...
01:17:48 and she said she didn't like the shaking screen.
01:17:50 She said it made her feel sick.
01:17:52 And you know, I could see it in a video.
01:17:54 If you're just watching it, it probably doesn't feel good at all.
01:17:56 But when you're playing it, it's so awesome.
01:17:58 Okay, well, I...
01:18:00 The funny thing is...
01:18:02 Immediately, 100% was too much.
01:18:04 So I turned it down to 35%.
01:18:06 And if I can warm up to that, then I'll go higher.
01:18:10 Let me see what I have.
01:18:12 I'm curious now what...
01:18:14 My screen shake is on 100% and it's rad.
01:18:16 There wasn't even going to be like a slider in this game,
01:18:18 but people were literally saying
01:18:20 that the game was making them nauseous.
01:18:22 And so J.W. had to play a slider.
01:18:24 What a bunch of fucking ssss...
01:18:26 Ssss...
01:18:28 Real men play Nuclear Throne.
01:18:30 I wish everything had a slider like that for like the hunger games.
01:18:32 You know, turn off the camera shake.
01:18:34 Those movies would be way better.
01:18:36 I thought you were saying
01:18:38 that you wished the movie, the Hunger Games,
01:18:40 had a screen slider to turn off the screen
01:18:42 so you could just like slide down the screen
01:18:44 to just like make the movie not happen?
01:18:46 No, no, just make it...
01:18:48 Just get rid of the generic...
01:18:50 Get rid of the contemporary movie aesthetic
01:18:52 where everything shakes constantly.
01:18:54 When you tie it into the Hunger Games...
01:18:56 Dude, I got the blood hammer.
01:18:58 I've never even seen the blood hammer.
01:19:00 I would like it except...
01:19:02 I could accept it's blood
01:19:04 and that, you know, I lose my health, so...
01:19:06 You know, maybe Nuclear Throne is the Hunger Games.
01:19:08 Maybe Nuclear Throne is the Hunger Games.
01:19:10 They're put up to this to do with...
01:19:12 By Jon Snow.
01:19:14 Yes.
01:19:16 That's his name, right?
01:19:18 Wait, you know that you don't
01:19:20 lose health with a blood hammer
01:19:22 if your swing hits?
01:19:24 Oh, really? Oh, whoops.
01:19:26 You didn't notice?
01:19:28 I wish I had been...
01:19:30 Well, I mean, I've never actually had the blood hammer.
01:19:32 I just happened to be reading about
01:19:34 melee weapons on the wiki today and I read that.
01:19:36 Yeah, because you see, when I get a weapon,
01:19:38 the first thing I do is I shoot it around a bit
01:19:40 before actually engaging anything.
01:19:42 I'm like, oh, I lose health each time, okay?
01:19:44 Yeah, I mean, I see that.
01:19:46 So anyway...
01:19:48 But that would be terrible if you lost one every time.
01:19:50 I wish I'd been told that one half a second sooner
01:19:52 because then I would have gotten it
01:19:54 before going into the portal.
01:19:56 Well, I don't know.
01:19:58 But it ties to my chicken sword
01:20:00 that I'm not sure if I want to get rid of it, you know?
01:20:02 Oh, oh!
01:20:04 Top strat!
01:20:06 Drop your chicken sword
01:20:08 on the first level,
01:20:10 and then when you loop, it'll be there,
01:20:12 but it will be like a super mega,
01:20:14 like Superman ultra good
01:20:16 Bill Cosby good sword.
01:20:18 Yeah, but he's not going to loop, though.
01:20:20 But Bill Cosby isn't that good.
01:20:22 No, she's kidding. Bill Cosby's very good.
01:20:24 He's like hero.
01:20:26 Okay, yeah, but anyway,
01:20:28 that's true, that's a lie.
01:20:30 Would I ever tell you a lie, Davoo?
01:20:32 I don't know.
01:20:34 Look, there's a bazooka,
01:20:36 and I'm not going to...
01:20:38 I just killed 5 million enemies
01:20:40 with my power crossbow,
01:20:42 and it was the most amazing
01:20:44 empowering moment.
01:20:46 Oh, your super crossbow?
01:20:48 Wait, is there a difference
01:20:50 between the super crossbow
01:20:52 and the heavy crossbow?
01:20:54 Yeah.
01:20:56 Super crossbow shoots like a spray.
01:20:58 Heavy crossbow, that's what I have.
01:21:00 Heavy crossbow is so fucking bad.
01:21:02 My brother has a crossbow.
01:21:04 If you have trigger fingers,
01:21:06 then it's good.
01:21:08 But the reload time on that thing is just so...
01:21:10 I got trigger fingers,
01:21:12 and it's quite good.
01:21:14 Impact wrist,
01:21:16 corpses fly and hit harder.
01:21:18 Oh, that's so good.
01:21:20 That one is so much...
01:21:22 When I heard that, when I read that description,
01:21:24 I'm like, well, it probably doesn't make him fly
01:21:26 that much further, so I'm going to pass.
01:21:28 But then when I picked it, I'm like,
01:21:30 oh, they fly like 5...
01:21:32 Oh, I met a little hunter.
01:21:34 I believe in you, Davoo.
01:21:36 Everyone pray, dear God in heaven,
01:21:38 I love Davoo.
01:21:40 If he doesn't tell a little hunter I'm going to go to jail.
01:21:42 Please don't make me go to jail.
01:21:44 God, I'm a good man.
01:21:46 I love America, and I love everything about it.
01:21:48 Please don't make me go to jail.
01:21:50 Well, I died.
01:21:52 Nice job, dude.
01:21:54 I died, but then killed little hunter,
01:21:56 and now I'm dead.
01:21:58 Wait, so you and little hunter killed each other?
01:22:00 Kill each other.
01:22:02 That's something.
01:22:04 Congratulations.
01:22:06 Basically, I killed little hunter,
01:22:08 but I didn't get past him.
01:22:10 But that's the first time you go to jail.
01:22:12 And the thing is, I did not go into him
01:22:14 with any strategy, because going after him
01:22:16 with a crossbow is the stupidest idea ever,
01:22:18 because if it's really low time,
01:22:20 if you don't have triggers, you're right about that.
01:22:22 Because I just wasn't even thinking
01:22:24 about the fact that I was coming up against him.
01:22:26 Oh, and the other thing that made it really great
01:22:28 is that we were in a very tight corridor
01:22:30 with like, the cops were not on my ass at all.
01:22:32 Yeah, that's the best way to fight him.
01:22:34 Because I just, the location was perfect.
01:22:36 So the only reason I did that well
01:22:38 was that nothing else was there.
01:22:40 Which is always the reason why little hunter
01:22:42 kills me, is because he forced,
01:22:44 he panicked, and I run into everything.
01:22:46 So that's kind of another reason why
01:22:48 I'm not focusing, is that, yeah,
01:22:50 when I don't focus at all, I could die
01:22:52 before I even get to the sewers occasionally.
01:22:54 But that level of like,
01:22:56 crazy, just my mind
01:22:58 can ramble, sometimes
01:23:00 brilliant things can occur.
01:23:02 So I like having
01:23:04 a randomly generated brain at the same time
01:23:06 to make it truly roguelike.
01:23:08 Mmm, that's good.
01:23:10 True roguelike experience.
01:23:12 I have another 3DS 3D
01:23:14 super food tip for you.
01:23:16 When you,
01:23:18 okay, when you get to
01:23:20 5.3, it's a timer
01:23:22 for when little hunter comes.
01:23:24 It's not like how many enemies you kill with big bandit.
01:23:26 So it'll immediately start taking down.
01:23:28 So what you want to do is,
01:23:30 you want to go right up next to a wall
01:23:32 and kind of like walk into it, you know?
01:23:34 And then little hunter will be like,
01:23:36 oh, I'm going to land right on top of him.
01:23:38 So he'll land right inside of that wall.
01:23:40 And then he'll make like a little cove for himself
01:23:42 so he can't really back away or anything.
01:23:44 So you can just nail him right then and there.
01:23:46 Against as well.
01:23:50 Huh.
01:23:51 I want to say,
01:23:52 that I think that the fact that
01:23:54 the hunters pretend to be dead,
01:23:56 I mean that the assassins pretend to be dead
01:23:58 is really cool. Yeah, yeah it is.
01:24:00 Wait, which ones are the assassins?
01:24:02 The purple ones?
01:24:04 You know, like you'll come upon them
01:24:06 and they look like they're dead.
01:24:08 But sometimes you can see they're like...
01:24:10 You mean like they pretend to be undead.
01:24:12 You mean like they play POSSIBLE? No.
01:24:14 Yeah, those guys killed me a couple of times
01:24:16 before I understood their nature.
01:24:18 Dude, they're great.
01:24:20 And then, oh, fucking mimics.
01:24:22 And then they get up and they run at you
01:24:24 but they run in this erratic pattern.
01:24:26 They know exactly what to do and make it really hard
01:24:28 to hit them. And you never even see their attack
01:24:30 because it's so fast. They can also reflect bullets.
01:24:32 Yeah, well, you have like...
01:24:34 They can reflect bullets. Wow.
01:24:36 See, I always love games where you feel like
01:24:38 enemies that have the same movesets
01:24:40 and the same mindset that you have.
01:24:42 That's always the coolest thing.
01:24:44 You know, that's what Undertale's got.
01:24:46 It's got a character who has...
01:24:48 It's basically the same powers as you
01:24:50 that you're in competition with.
01:24:52 Again, this is the sequel to Undertale.
01:24:54 It just came out this year. Toby Fox
01:24:56 shipped it off to some people in Sweden.
01:24:58 He doesn't want to make video games anymore.
01:25:00 He got all this money. He doesn't need to make any more art.
01:25:02 This is all just a front to get money.
01:25:04 And now this is the sequel to Undertale.
01:25:06 Just like Downwell is the prequel to Undertale
01:25:08 because it's about falling down.
01:25:10 The post-cool to Undertale is Shovel Knight
01:25:12 because that also has...
01:25:14 That also has...
01:25:16 All the bosses in Shovel Knight
01:25:18 make me think
01:25:20 if I were playing as that character
01:25:22 with that moveset, I would try to
01:25:24 fight Shovel Knight roughly the way
01:25:26 this AI is trying to fight me.
01:25:28 Where...
01:25:30 Not all of the bosses. I mean, they're not quite that on that level.
01:25:32 But a lot of the bosses
01:25:34 that you fight in that game
01:25:36 seem to be getting the most usage out of
01:25:38 their stamina level and
01:25:40 their moveset as they possibly can.
01:25:42 And that makes the fight feel
01:25:44 way more engaging than most boss fights do.
01:25:46 Where most boss fights are total bozos
01:25:48 who sit around and wait for you to hit them.
01:25:50 And that's why most boss fights are not interesting
01:25:52 to me in most games.
01:25:54 Oh shit, my niggas. Gatlin Sugga.
01:26:00 I think I'm going to be encountering
01:26:02 a little hunter.
01:26:04 Little pizza maker? That's what I call him.
01:26:06 I almost called him little slugger.
01:26:08 Dude, that'd be cute.
01:26:10 Hey!
01:26:12 I don't know how else to phrase this question
01:26:14 other than did you know, even though
01:26:16 I know you don't know, you could play as big dog
01:26:18 at one point.
01:26:20 What takes a big dog? Oh yeah, that big dog.
01:26:22 What? Yeah.
01:26:24 The one that I keep calling mad dog.
01:26:26 It's a mad world.
01:26:28 Wait, why would you play as mad dog?
01:26:30 You can't go anywhere.
01:26:32 I know, that's what was good about him.
01:26:34 Fuck!
01:26:36 That's how you do that.
01:26:38 Shit! Holy fuck!
01:26:40 Fucking ice.
01:26:42 Look up footage of big dog
01:26:44 playing a nuker throne and you're going to like
01:26:46 shit yourself.
01:26:48 Hey, here's the thing.
01:26:50 I encountered an enemy version
01:26:52 of horror the character
01:26:54 before I unlocked.
01:26:56 Wait, which character you said?
01:26:58 Horror.
01:27:00 Which one is horror?
01:27:02 Little green doggo.
01:27:04 Little radiation monster.
01:27:06 Oh yeah, that one.
01:27:08 Yeah, what was up with that?
01:27:10 Will you ignore radiation
01:27:12 for three levels of spawns
01:27:14 and that's how you unlock him?
01:27:16 I got long arms.
01:27:18 This is gonna be great.
01:27:20 Long arms is, you know...
01:27:22 Well, that's cool.
01:27:24 I unlocked him without even meaning to.
01:27:26 Yeah.
01:27:28 Long arms is the most
01:27:30 nice thing for me to have
01:27:32 with a chicken sword.
01:27:34 Aw, man.
01:27:36 Oh yeah, man. If I was chicken, I would...
01:27:38 Well, actually, then again, the chicken sword
01:27:40 is not really that great, is it?
01:27:42 Because it doesn't...
01:27:44 Like, the wrench is not very good.
01:27:46 Like, the wrench is good for the sewers,
01:27:48 but after that it's like worthless.
01:27:50 And if the chicken sword does less damage...
01:27:52 Nice.
01:27:54 And if the chicken sword does less damage than the wrench,
01:27:56 I gotta imagine it's probably not that good.
01:27:58 Yeah, honestly, it's not that good.
01:28:00 For me, I can't...
01:28:02 I just can't quite deal with
01:28:04 the reload time of all the other melee weapons
01:28:06 that are bigger.
01:28:08 That delay,
01:28:10 even if I have trigger fingers,
01:28:12 that delay is a bit too much for me.
01:28:14 I would much rather have to finagle around
01:28:16 doing more strafing to get those hits in
01:28:18 than I would
01:28:20 with the delay.
01:28:22 Davoo, next time you pick up...
01:28:24 Well, the first time when you pick up the energy sword,
01:28:26 you're gonna feel like a Sumerian god of swordsmanship.
01:28:30 Believe me.
01:28:32 It's gonna rock your brain and destroy your dick.
01:28:34 I saw it.
01:28:36 I saw a guy loop like four times with that.
01:28:38 But I didn't get it.
01:28:40 Oh, I was gonna tell you, Davoo,
01:28:42 the world record right now is like a slow play.
01:28:44 So I think you'd like it.
01:28:46 I'll link it to you later.
01:28:48 The world record for what? Score?
01:28:50 I see.
01:28:52 I didn't even know there was a score.
01:28:54 Yeah, it's how many kills you get, dummy.
01:28:56 Oh.
01:28:58 That's why it displays it afterward.
01:29:00 And so it's just your kills,
01:29:02 not any other factors.
01:29:04 Because I would love...
01:29:06 I would be interested if the game had
01:29:08 a really advanced scoring system,
01:29:10 based on lots of different factors.
01:29:12 That'd be pretty cool.
01:29:14 I want to be based on distance, too.
01:29:16 But I think the farther someone's gone
01:29:18 is like loop four, I think.
01:29:20 I'm not sure.
01:29:22 Loop three,
01:29:24 turn things up a bit,
01:29:26 and you get scared,
01:29:28 and you turn into Home Alone.
01:29:30 Because I like that movie.
01:29:32 Yeah, apparently.
01:29:34 What are you talking about?
01:29:36 What does Home Alone have to do with this?
01:29:38 You turn into Home Alone, Davoo.
01:29:40 Don't you understand?
01:29:42 Okay, whatever.
01:29:44 You know, whenever I recover
01:29:46 my life back as chicken,
01:29:48 I always forget that that means
01:29:50 my health is reduced.
01:29:52 You know how to regain your health?
01:29:54 You either have to get
01:29:56 a stationary medkit,
01:29:58 or you can pick Last Wish,
01:30:00 if you're stupid.
01:30:02 Yeah.
01:30:04 Well, unless you want to unlock chicken.
01:30:06 Oh, wait.
01:30:08 Never mind.
01:30:10 I can't believe you actually found that out
01:30:12 without me telling you, by the way.
01:30:14 How do I unlock chicken?
01:30:16 I looked it up.
01:30:18 Who, me?
01:30:20 You told me.
01:30:22 I just looked it up.
01:30:24 Although to be fair,
01:30:26 I wanted chicken because I heard she has
01:30:28 a melee weapon from the start,
01:30:30 and I wanted a character with a melee weapon by default,
01:30:32 so I went out of my way to unlock chicken.
01:30:34 So I looked it up.
01:30:36 The way that I unlocked chicken
01:30:38 actually got to a
01:30:40 point where I had to choose a mutation,
01:30:42 and I was at one health, and Last Wish was an option.
01:30:44 I was like, you know, I actually kind of want that,
01:30:46 just so I won't die.
01:30:48 Okay.
01:30:50 I've regained my faith in you.
01:30:52 Your faith was on the line here,
01:30:54 and I was thinking, you know,
01:30:56 if Ben doesn't say that this was an earnest
01:30:58 take at trying to get chicken,
01:31:00 I might not even like him.
01:31:02 I don't like this person anymore.
01:31:04 Like if I cheated at the game
01:31:06 and just had to say, you know what, Ben,
01:31:08 we're not going to cut a little more.
01:31:10 When I first was playing this game,
01:31:12 when I first saw Last Wish,
01:31:14 I thought of Last Dream,
01:31:16 which is that item in the final
01:31:18 Undertale.
01:31:20 Oh, yeah.
01:31:22 That reminds me of one nitpick
01:31:24 with the aesthetic of this game is that,
01:31:26 I don't know if it could have been done better.
01:31:28 It's Undertale.
01:31:30 It's not Undertale.
01:31:32 That's my own complaint.
01:31:34 It's that the level up
01:31:36 cards that you see
01:31:38 have, I don't know if this could have been done
01:31:40 better necessarily, but the level up
01:31:42 cards all have a character on them,
01:31:44 which is kind of, it makes it
01:31:46 a little confusing. It's like,
01:31:48 I'm not that character right now,
01:31:50 so I just feel like if they had done
01:31:52 other types of illustrations that were more abstract,
01:31:54 then that would have been
01:31:56 better. But again, the way this is fine,
01:31:58 once I got used to it, it wasn't,
01:32:00 it was only distracting when I first began
01:32:02 playing the game.
01:32:04 I don't mind that, but it does make me wonder
01:32:06 if the ones that have
01:32:08 a particular character on them,
01:32:10 if that's that character's canonical
01:32:12 moveset. That would be interesting.
01:32:14 Well, I think my head canon
01:32:16 is that they're all canonical to everyone.
01:32:18 Ever since,
01:32:20 I guess another thing I like about
01:32:22 the nuclear thrown characters
01:32:24 is thanks to Undertale,
01:32:26 where ever since Undertale, I now think
01:32:28 of every video game protagonist as a time
01:32:30 traveler.
01:32:32 See, the thing about this game is that
01:32:34 it takes place in different universes.
01:32:36 That's what Loops is. It's not the same universe.
01:32:38 It's a different universe.
01:32:40 I see, okay.
01:32:42 I just naturally think
01:32:44 of all video game protagonists as time travelers now.
01:32:46 If you watch my Emily as a Way video,
01:32:48 there's a part where I mention
01:32:50 like, so then you go back in time
01:32:52 to do it this way instead.
01:32:54 I've been playing
01:32:56 papers, please.
01:32:58 And I literally think of this guy
01:33:00 as this art stoatskin citizen
01:33:02 who thinks don't go well for him
01:33:04 so he starts over again to try to make things right.
01:33:06 I just think of that way now
01:33:08 because that just makes so much more sense
01:33:10 and it makes every video game better.
01:33:12 So that's part of what endears me to the nuclear thrown cast
01:33:14 is their determination.
01:33:16 And that's why Undertale is the best game in the world.
01:33:18 That is. Because it made all other games better.
01:33:20 When I was playing it, I actively thought
01:33:22 this makes all video games
01:33:24 15% better,
01:33:26 like, approximately that amount.
01:33:28 Hey, what would that number be
01:33:30 if it was 5% more?
01:33:32 Say that sentence again, but have 5% more
01:33:34 on that debut.
01:33:36 Yeah, when I said that I realized,
01:33:38 but I'm talking about better, not like cool or anything.
01:33:40 Hmm.
01:33:42 Well, aren't they the same thing?
01:33:44 No. I don't know.
01:33:46 I would argue so. I got prescription sunglasses the other day.
01:33:48 Oh, very nice.
01:33:50 I've got some.
01:33:52 Prescription sunglasses, did the doctor have to measure
01:33:54 that I haven't worn in years?
01:33:56 Yeah, I did.
01:33:58 It was an arctuous process, but you know what?
01:34:00 It was worth it, because now I look 20% cooler.
01:34:02 Very tidal back in.
01:34:04 So I died as chicken,
01:34:06 but then I opened the portal
01:34:08 and so now I get another chance.
01:34:10 I'm sweet. I have a chance for, um...
01:34:12 Last wish.
01:34:14 No, actually not really. I have a chance for some kills
01:34:16 for regenerate HP and more melee range.
01:34:18 I'm going to go with some kills for regenerate HP
01:34:20 because I want to be able to live.
01:34:22 Dude, that's an awesome upgrade.
01:34:24 Yeah, yeah. No, yeah, yeah.
01:34:26 I didn't make it, so...
01:34:28 Bloodlust is good too.
01:34:30 Bloodlust is my favorite upgrade, I think.
01:34:32 Partly because the card for it looks so awesome,
01:34:34 because it's white and red.
01:34:36 It's like, oh yeah.
01:34:38 The card does look awesome,
01:34:40 and it's wicked good,
01:34:42 because it benefits you for killing
01:34:44 and killing is the one thing you always have to do,
01:34:46 which is why I really like what he shot too,
01:34:48 although I don't think it's quite as good as this one.
01:34:50 Yeah, you might be right about that, but...
01:34:52 I mean, because like...
01:34:54 Okay, it's great if you're having ammo problems,
01:34:56 but not every game
01:34:58 do you have ammo problems,
01:35:00 and if you have a game where you're good on ammo,
01:35:02 it's not a very useful upgrade.
01:35:04 Well, I think having more or ammo
01:35:06 isn't necessarily a bad thing ever.
01:35:08 No, it...
01:35:10 God, please let me live!
01:35:12 God, no!
01:35:14 But it's like...
01:35:16 You only hit...
01:35:18 You only have to think about ammo
01:35:20 if you're running low,
01:35:22 and so if you are running low,
01:35:24 then Lucky Shot's gonna be great,
01:35:26 but if you're not, then it's like...
01:35:28 Well, since I do melee, I never had to worry about ammo.
01:35:30 So did you die, Munchy?
01:35:32 Yeah, when you're...
01:35:34 When you're a melee, it's not as big a deal.
01:35:36 Which is another reason why I haven't been taking Lucky Shot
01:35:38 as much, because I've been doing more melee.
01:35:40 Munchy, did you die?
01:35:42 No, I didn't die.
01:35:44 Yeah, I know.
01:35:46 I can make it out of any situation.
01:35:48 My name's Henry Houdini, and I live inside the universe.
01:35:50 Okay.
01:35:52 Of the game, I mean.
01:35:54 Not in this universe.
01:35:56 It's just the real universe.
01:35:58 You know, one thing I like about,
01:36:00 um, like,
01:36:02 something that this game has made me feel good at
01:36:04 is being able to swap weapons
01:36:06 while I'm in the middle of a thought,
01:36:08 you know?
01:36:10 Because when I was first getting into Nuclear Throw,
01:36:12 for some reason I just haven't played games
01:36:14 or anything yet, where whenever I'm switching weapons
01:36:16 I have to preoccupy myself with the fact
01:36:18 that I am switching weapons.
01:36:20 It's not something that I could just do.
01:36:22 But now I am good at that.
01:36:24 I'll hit you with one bullet of this,
01:36:26 with two bullets of that,
01:36:28 and with one more bullet of this.
01:36:30 It has a...
01:36:32 It's a good, simple...
01:36:34 It has a bit of a...
01:36:36 It has a rubbing your head
01:36:38 and patting your head
01:36:40 sensation to it.
01:36:42 What do you...
01:36:44 What do you mean by that?
01:36:46 That's hard to do.
01:36:48 What are you talking about, Manji?
01:36:50 I'm just saying, like, when you succeed at...
01:36:52 I've never heard that expression before,
01:36:54 ever in my entire life.
01:36:56 You've never heard the expression
01:36:58 rubbing your belly and patting your head?
01:37:00 No.
01:37:02 It's not really an expression as much as
01:37:04 just a description of a thing.
01:37:06 Well, the idea of it is that it requires...
01:37:08 It's like an interesting allocation of brain
01:37:10 that's a little bit harder to do than you'd expect.
01:37:12 And you have to, like...
01:37:14 You have to, like, meditate on it
01:37:16 for a few seconds before you can do it.
01:37:18 And when you do it, it has, like,
01:37:20 this interesting sensation of, like,
01:37:22 it's really satisfying multitasking and stuff.
01:37:24 So, um, yeah.
01:37:26 Davoo, are you
01:37:28 a serial killer?
01:37:30 Answer the question, Davoo.
01:37:32 There was one time...
01:37:34 There was one time
01:37:36 a box of Crave fell for no reason
01:37:38 wasting most of it, and so I shredded the box
01:37:40 to pieces because I was so mad.
01:37:42 And I knew that if any
01:37:44 serial ever did that again,
01:37:46 I would also ceremoniously kill it with a sword
01:37:48 like I did that box of Crave.
01:37:50 What the fuck is Crave?
01:37:52 It's a Kellogg's
01:37:54 serial that is like...
01:37:56 It's like, um...
01:37:58 Ew, Kellogg's? Don't you know
01:38:00 you're supporting the man?
01:38:02 Let's talk about politics.
01:38:04 It's true.
01:38:06 It's on Paul.
01:38:08 No, dude, that's old man Rand Paul
01:38:10 2012.
01:38:12 Then it'll be Ryan Paul
01:38:14 his son.
01:38:16 Good old Ann Rand Paul.
01:38:18 Yeah, then it'll come full circle.
01:38:20 The entire libertarian
01:38:22 circle of life will be complete.
01:38:24 Uh, what kind of...
01:38:26 Oh my god, Rand Paul probably was named after me.
01:38:28 I thought about that.
01:38:30 I don't have the nerve to look it up because if it's true,
01:38:32 it'll be very creepy and hilarious and awesome.
01:38:34 What kind of
01:38:36 social views do you think these characters have?
01:38:38 Like, one by one?
01:38:40 Well, I think they're...
01:38:42 Munchy, have you seen
01:38:44 um, that picture
01:38:46 that's floating around the internet?
01:38:48 It's called, it's Ask Human Tail.
01:38:50 Yes!
01:38:52 Yeah, okay. Well,
01:38:54 in my opinion, all the characters
01:38:56 in Nuclear Throne have
01:38:58 weird and
01:39:00 out there gender and sexual
01:39:02 identities of that sort.
01:39:04 They're all like
01:39:06 asexual, bi-romantic demigods.
01:39:08 Asexual. I remember when
01:39:10 I was looking at someone's DeviantArt pictures
01:39:12 and like,
01:39:14 he had like this one of him and he said
01:39:16 I'm asexual, bi-romantic.
01:39:18 I'm like, whoa, it's an all new type.
01:39:20 I haven't seen, I haven't heard of before.
01:39:22 Yeah, of course.
01:39:24 I was talking to Digi about this the other day
01:39:26 and we just after a long and complicated
01:39:28 process of deep soul
01:39:30 researching, we determined that Digi is
01:39:32 a, is a hetero-demiromantic
01:39:34 hetero-demisexual.
01:39:36 What? That was too mean.
01:39:38 Hey, you know what? I believe it.
01:39:40 What the heck is, what the heck is
01:39:42 demiromantic mean?
01:39:44 Demi is the worst thing ever
01:39:46 because it describes literally everyone
01:39:48 in the world, so everyone who describes
01:39:50 themselves as it is a genius.
01:39:52 I don't understand what demi means.
01:39:54 Being demisexual means you have sexual
01:39:56 attraction, but only for people
01:39:58 with strong connection to.
01:40:00 Oh.
01:40:02 Meaning basically
01:40:04 a normal person.
01:40:06 Well, I guess you need that word.
01:40:08 I mean, we are homo-safians after all.
01:40:10 Yeah.
01:40:12 Like, you know, people complain about
01:40:14 the whole how every Tumblr thing has
01:40:16 like this detailed description of their
01:40:18 gender and I'm like, you know,
01:40:20 when I first was seeing that, I'm like, that's a little bit weird.
01:40:22 But at the same time, I want to know that
01:40:24 because, you know, it's
01:40:26 I know it's kind of weird, but I do
01:40:28 like being able to know the gender
01:40:30 of whoever I'm talking to because it does
01:40:32 slightly affect my etiquette with
01:40:34 them, right?
01:40:36 Very slightly.
01:40:38 On a place like Tumblr,
01:40:40 where you don't know
01:40:42 who you're talking to, I can kind of see
01:40:44 how, you know,
01:40:46 yes, I'm a girl, use this pronoun
01:40:48 is like, it makes sense.
01:40:50 If I know that someone is male or female,
01:40:52 I will talk more
01:40:54 like, I mean, in real life,
01:40:56 you will talk to certain people of different
01:40:58 genders very with a different kind of
01:41:00 different level of tone, you know, just
01:41:02 but
01:41:04 if someone, okay, if someone
01:41:06 let's say someone looks male
01:41:08 but they want
01:41:10 but they don't identify as male
01:41:12 and they want to be referred to by
01:41:14 I don't know, let's say female or
01:41:16 or neutral pronouns
01:41:18 like they want you to call them they.
01:41:20 Um
01:41:22 Am I an asshole for finding
01:41:24 that like a big ask and
01:41:26 like it's sort of an imposition
01:41:28 like it's asking me to go out of my way
01:41:30 to refer to you as something that
01:41:32 is like not
01:41:34 is not how I would naturally
01:41:36 do so.
01:41:38 I don't know what I'm saying.
01:41:40 I think if you look like
01:41:42 a little girl, like
01:41:44 me, then it's
01:41:46 easier to do it.
01:41:48 Like
01:41:50 the biggest qualifier
01:41:52 because at first I was like saying my opinions on this
01:41:54 like, oh, you know, this and that, but like
01:41:56 I don't know any openly trans people.
01:41:58 I don't know anyone who I know is trans
01:42:00 or anything like that. So I know
01:42:02 I can't say because, you know, you get
01:42:04 certain people who are like
01:42:06 these trans guys who then will like
01:42:08 dye their hair purple
01:42:10 and then like not look like a woman at all and it's like
01:42:12 well, that's weird, but obviously
01:42:14 I'm sure many people think this
01:42:16 obviously all the people who do an unconvincing
01:42:18 job of being trans are going to be the ones
01:42:20 who you notice
01:42:22 and all the ones who you don't notice are going to be
01:42:24 the ones who are good at it.
01:42:26 I think if someone
01:42:28 was good at convincing me they were
01:42:30 a woman or a man, then it would be very
01:42:32 natural and easy for me, I think.
01:42:34 I mean, it
01:42:36 yeah, it would be easy and I know
01:42:38 I know one, I know a trans
01:42:40 woman who is
01:42:42 I mean, it looks like a man, like
01:42:44 when I see them, I think, oh
01:42:46 male and I want to say he, and I
01:42:48 felt like I was the only person
01:42:50 in my circle who had any problem
01:42:52 with this and I felt really bad about it
01:42:54 because nobody else seemed
01:42:56 to ever make the mistake and I constantly
01:42:58 did. Is it Nate? Are you
01:43:00 trying to be on the bush here?
01:43:02 It's Nate, it's
01:43:04 the best guy ever
01:43:06 who is now the best girl ever.
01:43:08 No, but
01:43:10 yeah, and like
01:43:12 it's unfair to say that, oh
01:43:14 if you can
01:43:16 actually look like
01:43:18 what I imagine a woman to look like, if
01:43:20 you look a certain way
01:43:22 then I can accept your request to
01:43:24 refer to you by this special pronoun
01:43:26 and if you look another way then I can.
01:43:28 I'm thinking bringing this back to nuclear
01:43:30 throne, I have no difficulty thinking of
01:43:32 I have no difficulty thinking of
01:43:34 obviously chicken as a female, but
01:43:36 I have no problem remembering that
01:43:38 I have no problem remembering that
01:43:40 you know, crystal is female
01:43:42 I actually do, it took
01:43:44 me a long time, I mean
01:43:46 I think I'm starting to get the hang of it, but
01:43:48 even after I found out crystal was real.
01:43:50 Like if you have heads around the house you can get good at that
01:43:52 you know, remembering which ones
01:43:54 which genders, you know whatever.
01:43:56 Yeah, I guess you're cool.
01:44:00 I think of people
01:44:02 being able to select their gender like a freaking
01:44:04 vending machine is part
01:44:06 of what makes
01:44:08 life cool where everything can become a vending
01:44:10 machine. Everything that you used to take for granted
01:44:12 can now be an option
01:44:14 and obviously people are going to be
01:44:16 really annoying the way they'll go about
01:44:18 it, some of them, and some people will be
01:44:20 flam
01:44:22 will be very aggressive and
01:44:24 hypocritical about it, but everyone will
01:44:26 be, there was a moment at which
01:44:28 I made peace with all of the LGBT
01:44:30 stuff in its militantism
01:44:32 when I realized everything
01:44:34 gets militarized, everything is hypocritical
01:44:36 maybe that
01:44:38 core has a slightly
01:44:40 larger percentage of
01:44:42 people who are militants and hypocritical
01:44:44 maybe the percentage is
01:44:46 slightly higher, but
01:44:48 because that's the worst thing when there's some minority
01:44:50 that you're a part of and then
01:44:52 if it's like an
01:44:54 obscure one
01:44:56 then people will only have very limited
01:44:58 experiences with that minority
01:45:00 and it'll most likely be
01:45:02 the big assholes who want
01:45:04 everyone to know it and
01:45:06 that's kind of the problem with any group
01:45:08 any group, there's going to be a percentage of them
01:45:10 who are normal people otherwise, then there'll be
01:45:12 a bunch of weirdos, then there'll be a bunch of assholes
01:45:14 the asshole slice of
01:45:16 that pie will leave the pie
01:45:18 and tell everyone about the pie
01:45:20 and then everyone will think that that group
01:45:22 is a bunch of assholes because the assholes
01:45:24 are the activists who represent them all
01:45:26 so
01:45:28 that's what I like to keep in mind that
01:45:30 I'm not going to think of someone
01:45:32 as some jerk face until they start being a
01:45:34 jerk face to me until then
01:45:36 it's like, you know
01:45:38 everything else about the advanced
01:45:40 21st century society
01:45:42 I really like, so
01:45:44 you know, I like the fact that
01:45:46 I can just make youtube videos as a living
01:45:48 that's a pretty crazy notion
01:45:50 that's a pretty crazy stupid thing
01:45:52 that people from the 50s would think
01:45:54 is lazy, but that's the whole
01:45:56 point of
01:45:58 yeah, like
01:46:00 50 years ago it wasn't expected that
01:46:02 you could just identify as a different gender
01:46:04 that would be considered a weak thing to do
01:46:06 that you'd be giving into
01:46:08 what you feel is comfortable for you
01:46:10 rather than manning up or
01:46:12 womaning up and just dealing with life
01:46:14 and people back in the
01:46:16 50s or whatever back 100 years ago
01:46:18 could have had the nerve to just deal
01:46:20 with it and move on
01:46:22 but guess what, people 100 years ago
01:46:24 they couldn't have survived 10,000 years ago
01:46:26 when you had to learn how to build a spear
01:46:28 and fight a fucking tiger
01:46:30 that whole point we invent stuff
01:46:32 and make society better
01:46:34 is so that you can be more comfortable
01:46:36 and be a big baby and live exactly the way you want
01:46:38 without having to die or get uncomfortable
01:46:40 or without having to get hungry
01:46:42 that's the whole point of human progress
01:46:44 is to have every little tiny stupid thing you want
01:46:48 so yeah
01:46:50 ah shit, killed by on
01:46:52 gosh dang, I hate when the rat kills me in this video game
01:46:56 well I pretty much
01:46:58 I agree with all that stuff you just said
01:47:00 thank you very much
01:47:02 there was a
01:47:04 yeah I think in the past
01:47:06 I might have been a little salty and been a little like
01:47:08 you know
01:47:10 being a transsexual is just like
01:47:12 they're just making it up
01:47:14 I don't know about that
01:47:16 but it all kind of comes down to how you define
01:47:18 it all just comes down to definition of terms
01:47:20 some people don't acknowledge
01:47:22 that gender is a
01:47:24 performative thing
01:47:26 when some people say gender
01:47:28 what they mean is
01:47:30 biological
01:47:32 but when other people's tumblr pages will list their gender
01:47:34 and their sex which threw me off at first
01:47:36 but if you feel it's not that way
01:47:38 then fine
01:47:40 yeah yeah but like people
01:47:42 that are trans generally don't use the word
01:47:44 that way so when someone says
01:47:46 oh you know it's not real
01:47:48 you're not really a female or whatever
01:47:50 you're not really whatever gender you say
01:47:52 well that's just a question of how you're defining your terms
01:47:56 I like the colors
01:47:58 in this game
01:48:00 a nuclear throne yes the colors
01:48:02 it's you know it starts off with a desert level
01:48:04 which obviously means that they were
01:48:06 like that's usually level 2
01:48:08 is desert at least in mario
01:48:10 desert is level 2 but they made it level 1
01:48:12 and it's actually
01:48:14 that's because everyone's mean in this game
01:48:16 they all wear big boy pants
01:48:18 and kill people because they're mean
01:48:20 you know I just I wish
01:48:22 I was a little girl
01:48:24 I think that nuclear throne would be a much
01:48:26 better more solid game
01:48:28 if you started in a planes
01:48:30 and level 2 was a forest
01:48:32 and level 3 was a mountain
01:48:34 and level 4 was snow
01:48:36 and level 5 was fire
01:48:38 with the yachty joke
01:48:40 which is just him going
01:48:42 grass world desert world water world mountain world
01:48:44 rock world boss
01:48:46 it's a remix it's every mario game
01:48:48 I have heard
01:48:50 I have heard him say things like that
01:48:52 that reminds me
01:48:54 I haven't watched any zero punctuation
01:48:56 a while ago
01:48:58 I just stopped watching his
01:49:00 episodes like for like almost a year
01:49:02 and then I would just get through them all
01:49:04 but now I'm back to following them weekly
01:49:06 you know what I just realized about
01:49:08 the level color palette is that
01:49:10 the desert level is actually the most vibrantly colored level
01:49:12 isn't that interesting
01:49:14 it's actually the most vibrant level in the game
01:49:18 I don't know about that
01:49:20 maybe the
01:49:22 it's got all this fucking
01:49:24 yeah maybe that but at least for
01:49:26 all the games
01:49:28 well I'm talking like how
01:49:30 overall bright everything is
01:49:32 because usually the desert level is a time
01:49:34 to have a more
01:49:36 reserved color palette where everything is
01:49:38 more monotone and even though it is kind of
01:49:40 monotone it's all yellow it has fewer colors
01:49:42 going on but it is the most vibrant
01:49:44 the most brightly lit so it does
01:49:46 give you that sort of planes feeling
01:49:48 you know of grass feeling where like things are the most
01:49:50 optimistic in a way
01:49:52 because like even though it's a desert it's the most
01:49:54 optimistic because there's so much sun
01:49:58 so that's kind of a cool
01:50:00 way it conveys the level one sensation
01:50:02 that was something that was weird to me
01:50:04 what's your favorite level in this game
01:50:06 by the way
01:50:08 well I'm gonna say the junkyard area
01:50:10 because it's got rain and the rain is cool
01:50:12 you may notice in my video on it
01:50:14 I predominantly use the rain section
01:50:16 that's true
01:50:20 oh Jesus save me a prayer
01:50:22 I'm on the prairie
01:50:24 and I'm a slave
01:50:28 my favorite level
01:50:30 is
01:50:32 I don't know they're also annoying
01:50:34 in their own ways
01:50:36 I just actually love them even more
01:50:38 they all piss me off in
01:50:40 special unique ways
01:50:42 I actually really like the caves
01:50:44 yeah the caves are nice
01:50:46 the caves are really cool
01:50:48 they make me so mad those fucking
01:50:50 laser gems make me so mad
01:50:52 and those crystal
01:50:54 spiders take so many hits they're so durable
01:50:56 so I hate the caves
01:50:58 it's funny that you say that because I'm actually on the caves right now on loop
01:51:00 and gosh dang it
01:51:02 do I hate this boss and how much health it has
01:51:08 are we trying to avoid spoilers
01:51:10 munchie is trying to avoid spoilers
01:51:12 yeah the spoilers
01:51:14 came in like a giant van
01:51:20 should we explain
01:51:22 what this game is
01:51:24 oh yeah so
01:51:26 viewers
01:51:28 nuclear throne
01:51:30 is a roguelite
01:51:32 top down
01:51:34 they couldn't afford it that much guys
01:51:36 they know that much
01:51:38 that was the coolest thing I've experienced
01:51:40 oh yeah crossbow time
01:51:42 when I was watching
01:51:44 Bruce Jenner
01:51:46 by the way I've been
01:51:48 by the way I've been getting worse at the game
01:51:50 the longer I've been playing it
01:51:52 I haven't even made it to the snow
01:51:54 to Snowden in like
01:51:56 I've been getting mediumer
01:51:58 that was the coolest thing when I was watching
01:52:00 some loop play through and the giant
01:52:02 vans showed up and then I learned that the way
01:52:04 to get to the
01:52:06 you're throwing a monkey rich right inside
01:52:08 the asshole right now
01:52:10 there's no way someone is going to
01:52:12 listen to a podcast
01:52:14 Ben, his name is
01:52:16 Ben, he's a chocolate man
01:52:18 and he's listening right now DeVoo
01:52:20 wait I actually wasn't listening right there
01:52:22 did I miss the spoiler
01:52:24 what's the point of spoilers
01:52:26 it's not
01:52:28 I actually appreciate it
01:52:30 I actually like being unspoiled so
01:52:32 well you shouldn't come into a podcast
01:52:34 if you don't want to get spoiled to it
01:52:36 you just have to say things in like
01:52:38 super like extra cool
01:52:40 like terms like say if I want to say
01:52:42 Van I say the big truck man from
01:52:44 Texas he isn't going to come down and run you over
01:52:46 I have seen the van
01:52:48 I have seen the van in a video
01:52:50 there's no way you can
01:52:52 be on a podcast about something
01:52:54 and try to avoid
01:52:56 spoilers for it hey buddy have you
01:52:58 been the throne I thought not
01:53:00 I'm the boss of this gym
01:53:02 he is, he's a champ
01:53:04 well the fact that you said
01:53:06 that there's a throne as a spoiler so there you go
01:53:08 shit
01:53:10 because you know back when I was first playing it
01:53:12 before I looked anything up I was like
01:53:14 maybe there's not a throne you know like
01:53:16 because of the way the game builds it up
01:53:18 but there's a tool tip that says
01:53:20 the throne definitely exists
01:53:22 exactly that's what made me think
01:53:24 that it may not
01:53:26 that maybe it doesn't
01:53:28 I was getting sort of a Wizard of Oz vibe from it
01:53:30 have you ever been liked
01:53:32 in your life yeah by the Wizard of Oz
01:53:34 the Wizard of Oz the greatest thing about
01:53:36 that thing contributes to the world
01:53:38 of storytelling that I don't know if a lot of people
01:53:40 get from it is the classic
01:53:42 act of subverting audience
01:53:44 expectations
01:53:46 because that's what the whole movie is about
01:53:48 is you always try to get to the wizard
01:53:50 but then he ends up being a jerk but then he ends up
01:53:52 just not being a wizard it like
01:53:54 superverts your expectations twice and even
01:53:56 if you're already it's a double twist
01:53:58 it's an old mobius double
01:54:00 it's so emotionally dense
01:54:02 it's so emotionally thick
01:54:04 did you say fuck because you referenced Homestuck
01:54:06 because that's what you should have done
01:54:08 no I love Homestuck Homestuck's the best thing ever
01:54:10 I said fuck because I crystal to deflect a missile
01:54:12 but then it just happened to explode
01:54:14 I didn't know you were a giant dancing homo bin
01:54:16 hmm I have just
01:54:18 what have you ever read
01:54:20 Problem Sooth by the way
01:54:22 yeah of course
01:54:24 we agree that that's better
01:54:26 it's not better
01:54:28 Problem Sooth is better than Homestuck
01:54:30 Problem Sooth is not better
01:54:32 yeah I know the one
01:54:34 what is that
01:54:36 Problem Sooth was the one he did before
01:54:38 I'm gonna get into Homestuck at some point
01:54:40 feel free to spoil it to me though
01:54:42 that's fine with me because I know that
01:54:44 no
01:54:46 I'm not asking
01:54:48 I'm just saying feel free if you want to
01:54:50 if you want to mention something
01:54:52 if you've seen like anything from Homestuck
01:54:54 I see troll fanfiction quite a lot
01:54:56 yeah well yeah
01:54:58 there's the trolls but I mean aside from that
01:55:00 okay what really got me about Homestuck
01:55:02 was it wasn't like anything
01:55:04 about the story which is like it's a good story
01:55:06 it's fine but
01:55:08 what really blew me away about Homestuck was how
01:55:10 just how like
01:55:12 it expanded in scope
01:55:14 not just like in its story
01:55:16 but in like the methods it used to tell it
01:55:18 this is kind of what
01:55:20 it's sort of what impressed me about Undertale too
01:55:22 is like how I didn't expect it to tell
01:55:24 its story so like
01:55:26 just the way that
01:55:28 in a lot of ways they play like a 16 bit
01:55:30 RPG to get around
01:55:32 that sounds cool yeah I know you already know
01:55:34 about that but like the fact that it starts
01:55:36 off as this weird goofy little
01:55:38 comic and yeah some of them are animated
01:55:40 some of them are gifts and whatever and it's got kind of a
01:55:42 weird format and that's fine but then
01:55:44 suddenly these fucking like big like
01:55:46 crazy flash movies start happening
01:55:48 these interactive games and these like
01:55:50 huge set piece moments
01:55:52 it was just
01:55:54 it just man back in the day
01:55:56 when you were reading Homestuck when it was new
01:55:58 and you didn't know that it was coming it must have been like
01:56:00 holy shit
01:56:02 holy shit it was scary
01:56:04 it was scary wait
01:56:06 did you read Homestuck when it was coming out
01:56:08 it's not done first of all and yes
01:56:12 yeah
01:56:14 you would have been like 10 years old
01:56:16 I'm 65 right now
01:56:18 he's
01:56:20 he's like 15
01:56:22 it's not
01:56:24 I didn't read it when it was brand spanking new
01:56:26 I picked it up when
01:56:30 which granted was a long time ago
01:56:32 but
01:56:34 I mean I think that's about when I picked it up too
01:56:36 I picked it up in like 2011 or something which like yeah
01:56:38 it wasn't new but I didn't know about
01:56:40 it and so for me it was new when I
01:56:42 when I got to the you know
01:56:44 wayward vagabond at the end
01:56:46 it was the longest time and I still love him
01:56:48 I remember yeah I remember he was
01:56:50 oh yeah I remember
01:56:52 he's awesome
01:56:54 yeah that first one where his station
01:56:56 like takes off it's just like
01:56:58 it's just so much more than you expected
01:57:00 from this fucking goofy little comic
01:57:02 and I mean I hadn't read Problem Sleuth
01:57:04 before I started Homestuck but I wish I had
01:57:06 me too because I feel like it would have
01:57:08 set my expectations differently
01:57:12 God no I fucking love Homestuck
01:57:14 the best thing ever
01:57:16 no it doesn't matter we're talking about Homestuck
01:57:18 okay
01:57:20 Undertale and
01:57:22 how they're the same
01:57:24 that's the biggest thing
01:57:26 that people need to be educated on whenever they call
01:57:28 Undertale
01:57:30 Tumblr core it's really Homestuck core
01:57:32 yeah that's true
01:57:34 Homestuck had the same
01:57:36 Homestuck had the same criticisms
01:57:38 levied at it for like basic
01:57:40 Homestuck is big enough of a deal on its own to be
01:57:42 its own thing it doesn't have to be Tumblr
01:57:44 everyone hates Homestuck now though
01:57:46 no that's not true
01:57:48 Homestuck ever
01:57:50 no I'm talking to Davoo Homestuck is definitely
01:57:52 got criticized for being like Tumblr
01:57:54 that's stupid you know what's funny is that like
01:57:56 it's funny it's like
01:57:58 the more it went on the more the game
01:58:00 most of the things I've become a really big fan of in the past
01:58:02 three years have been things that Tumblr loves
01:58:04 you know even though I don't love Tumblr
01:58:06 you know my little pony Steven Universe
01:58:08 Undertale
01:58:10 maybe it's just because like that's
01:58:12 the audience that that creators
01:58:14 have to appeal to you know
01:58:16 so like of course that's the stuff that you know
01:58:18 well you know like yeah
01:58:20 well for one thing creators are going to
01:58:22 especially if they get into Hollywood
01:58:24 or something they're gonna be inclined to be liberal
01:58:26 because of the social structure
01:58:28 there
01:58:30 that's my understanding is that basically
01:58:32 Hollywood is
01:58:34 like it's sort of
01:58:36 like liberal
01:58:38 liberal mentality
01:58:40 is inclined to be in Hollywood
01:58:42 because it's kind of a sort of
01:58:44 commune type of area you know
01:58:46 in a way like everyone works together
01:58:48 you have to work in sort of a
01:58:50 collaborative mindset
01:58:52 in a way you know what I'm saying like
01:58:54 rugged individualism doesn't make
01:58:56 Hollywood movies for the most part you know
01:58:58 and a million other factors
01:59:00 there's a million other factors
01:59:02 yeah I mean I guess I see what you mean I think it's
01:59:04 maybe more just that like
01:59:06 the culture of Hollywood is
01:59:08 liberal so therefore
01:59:10 the people that get accepted into that culture
01:59:12 will be other liberals generally
01:59:14 obviously a lot of it is also self perpetuating
01:59:16 but I think well what started it
01:59:18 being that way and I think
01:59:20 there's also a sense of
01:59:22 well obviously people who hate their parents
01:59:24 have a lot of inspiration
01:59:26 to create art you know
01:59:28 through parent hatred
01:59:30 parents are conservative and Christian
01:59:32 so there you go there's the correlator right there
01:59:34 um I mean
01:59:36 I think maybe there's something to that
01:59:38 well I think there's got to be a lot because like most of
01:59:40 I'm the freaking only
01:59:42 person on the internet who I
01:59:44 who I know I don't have any online friends
01:59:46 who come from Christian
01:59:48 conservative households who don't hate
01:59:50 their Christian parents everyone is
01:59:52 either raised by liberal parents
01:59:54 or hates their conservative parents
01:59:56 I'm a Christian but
01:59:58 doesn't everyone kind of hate their parents though
02:00:00 no no you're wrong and I hate people
02:00:02 like you well I hate
02:00:04 okay I'm using the word hate very
02:00:06 lightly I mean like disgruntled
02:00:08 is the proper word you know
02:00:10 I'm not not disgruntled
02:00:12 at all alright well little hunter killed me
02:00:14 I'm fucking disgruntled
02:00:16 listen to me hey Ben have you ever tried
02:00:18 to eat your own body
02:00:20 it's I think you should do that right now so you stop existing
02:00:22 and you like put your like arms
02:00:24 inside of your mouth and then you just chew away
02:00:26 dude I watched one cartoon where that happened
02:00:28 where like a sheep ate itself
02:00:30 that was the coolest thing it just
02:00:32 just shh shh shh shh shh shot everything
02:00:34 Deveaux do you read one piece
02:00:36 nope watch it
02:00:38 awful fucking eats himself
02:00:40 and it's awesome but he does it
02:00:42 to become more powerful
02:00:44 because his his devil
02:00:46 his devil fruit is about like he can
02:00:48 eat things and like take on their
02:00:50 properties sort of it's it's hard to
02:00:52 explain I don't really understand it honestly
02:00:54 but there's
02:00:56 yeah he and at one point
02:00:58 He actually eats himself to, like, reform his body into, like, a new shape.
02:01:03 So what you're saying is that one piece is Steven Universe?
02:01:08 Um, no, it's good.
02:01:12 Unlike Steven Universe, it's good.
02:01:15 You know, one of the other strange stuff.
02:01:18 Yeah, say something about Homestuck.
02:01:20 Right.
02:01:21 Oh, I think...
02:01:22 I'm sure this is, like, literally only me,
02:01:25 but I think Spurb was the most interesting thing about that,
02:01:28 and I wish it just stayed with the kids.
02:01:30 No, I totally agree with you.
02:01:32 And the fact that the game isn't gonna have Spurb in it fucking breaks my heart.
02:01:35 And, yeah, the fact that the early comic is all about exploring the mechanics of this crazy game,
02:01:42 that's what got me into the comic.
02:01:44 Now it's all about the characters, like, you know, resolving their arcs and whatever.
02:01:47 I mean, that's fine.
02:01:48 Are you joking me?
02:01:49 They're not gonna res...
02:01:50 I don't know.
02:01:52 Hustle's all about meta shit, and he's gonna pander to DigiBro, and I hate him.
02:01:58 He's gonna pander to DigiBro.
02:02:00 Yeah, he'd better.
02:02:02 If he wants to get to DigiBump, that is.
02:02:05 Um, no.
02:02:07 No, I mean, I'm reserving judgment on the ending of Homestuck.
02:02:10 I want to see the end so I can get perspective on all the fucking bullshit we've had to deal with.
02:02:15 I know, I know.
02:02:16 See whether it was all worth it.
02:02:18 So long, dude.
02:02:19 I want California to win.
02:02:21 I want that to be the big twist.
02:02:22 That would be meta.
02:02:23 That would be super meta, dude.
02:02:25 Dude, when John went back and, like, saw Caliborn and, like, brutalized him and left him traumatized,
02:02:33 I feel so sorry for him.
02:02:34 I know, he's his character.
02:02:36 Yeah, he's hard to hate.
02:02:39 He's gotta be.
02:02:41 He can't be the same Lord English that is, like, the fucking monster man.
02:02:45 He's gotta be a different dude, because he's too lovable.
02:02:48 Just unrelated.
02:02:50 I don't really like him.
02:02:51 I don't really like him that much.
02:02:53 Nah.
02:02:54 He's too green.
02:02:55 I don't know.
02:02:56 I don't know what it is about him.
02:02:57 I like his coat the most.
02:02:58 I think his coat is, like...
02:03:00 Oh, yeah.
02:03:01 His coat is really cool.
02:03:02 But, you know, I think he designed the coat before he designed the Lord English.
02:03:05 Yeah.
02:03:06 You know, I think that's literally true, actually.
02:03:08 I think it's definitely...
02:03:09 Homestuck induced.
02:03:10 Just, dude, oh, shit.
02:03:12 Oh, because you saw that fucking coat in the fucking scratch in Mission with the midnight crew.
02:03:16 Oh, my God, it was so fucking cool.
02:03:18 That was the shit.
02:03:19 You know, back in the day, people who skipped that are the vein of my existence.
02:03:24 Dude, I didn't...
02:03:25 I think I skipped it my first time through, and I felt like such an asshole when I went
02:03:29 back and read it, and it was so awesome.
02:03:31 Homestuck has allowed me to zone out a bit and made me realize I have the music on, and
02:03:36 that's also distracting me.
02:03:37 I just need the sound effects, so thank you.
02:03:39 You've helped improve my skills.
02:03:41 Welcome, dude.
02:03:42 Yeah, the music is droning.
02:03:44 Yeah.
02:03:46 I think Jack Noir was like my favorite villain for a long time, just because he was so cool.
02:03:52 He's just cool.
02:03:55 He's pretty cool.
02:03:56 I don't know if I'd say he's my favorite villain.
02:03:59 Well, not now.
02:04:00 He's just kind of like an angry...
02:04:01 He's just kind of like an angry...
02:04:02 I mean, he's always just been like...
02:04:04 He's just an angry dude.
02:04:05 I know, but he was...
02:04:06 He got personality, nigga.
02:04:09 He does.
02:04:10 He does.
02:04:11 He's got a lot of heart.
02:04:12 So, Munchy, you were talking a little while ago about why you're jaded to this game.
02:04:18 It didn't have the co-op like they wanted.
02:04:21 Oh, it didn't have the co-op, and there's a lot of...
02:04:24 I think just balance issues that they promised and didn't really deliver on just because
02:04:29 of time.
02:04:30 Well, not time.
02:04:31 Well, maybe time.
02:04:32 The way this game was released is they made a deal with Sony.
02:04:36 At least I'm pretty sure it was Sony.
02:04:38 What?
02:04:39 I know that's something to do...
02:04:40 Yeah, it's on the PlayStation.
02:04:41 In case you didn't know.
02:04:42 And we know.
02:04:43 They said they were going to release it by the end of the year.
02:04:46 And the end of the year came.
02:04:49 And so they had to release it, even though they...
02:04:52 Like, this update is extremely broken.
02:04:54 I don't know if you've ever encountered a...
02:04:57 When you go into a Crown Vault, there's a bug where you...
02:05:02 Sometimes it will like turn into like a broken level, and you'll have to like fight enemies
02:05:10 from the level, like before it.
02:05:12 Sounds like some NES glitches right there.
02:05:15 Yeah, it really is.
02:05:17 It changes like part of the walls.
02:05:18 Do you?
02:05:19 It looks really weird.
02:05:20 That's like some...
02:05:21 I've seen it change part of the walls.
02:05:22 That's cool.
02:05:23 Yeah.
02:05:24 I've seen it change part of the walls.
02:05:25 Honestly, I think it is cool, but the problem about that is it takes up one of your...
02:05:28 You can only have three...
02:05:29 You can only enter three Crown Vaults per run, which I think is the most stupidest thing
02:05:35 I've ever heard before.
02:05:36 But anyway, the reason that's not like cool is it like takes away one of those and you
02:05:41 can't, you know, takes away an opportunity to get a Crown.
02:05:45 Wow.
02:05:46 Man, I picked something I don't often pick.
02:05:49 I picked less enemy HP because I'm going...
02:05:52 Dude, that looks great.
02:05:54 You need to prioritize that one.
02:05:55 Because I'm playing chicken, but I have the screwdriver because I want to unlock YV,
02:05:58 which means I'm basically doing all melee, which is great except it takes forever to kill
02:06:02 things, but with less enemy HP, that is not a problem.
02:06:06 Uh...
02:06:07 Oh, yeah.
02:06:08 One of the main...
02:06:09 The scarier face is awesome.
02:06:10 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's great.
02:06:11 One of the main things I had about this game is something that neither of you know about
02:06:14 yet, so I can't...
02:06:15 Well, actually...
02:06:16 Yeah, fuck you.
02:06:17 Davoo has like warped my brain.
02:06:18 See, he's perverted my brain into something more sinister, something more dark.
02:06:22 If it's...
02:06:23 If it's not like a...
02:06:24 I mean, I'm probably not going to mind.
02:06:27 I'm definitely going to appreciate whatever you say, if it's interesting.
02:06:31 Oh, well, that's going to be up to you.
02:06:35 When you reach the throne room, and you're going to know, you're going to know what it
02:06:38 has been, and I'm going to ruin this price for you right now, but the generator...
02:06:43 Is it about blowing up the generators?
02:06:45 Okay.
02:06:46 When you get to the throne, you walk up and there are these generators, and from your
02:06:50 guys' perspective, they've always been there, right?
02:06:53 There's never been a time where there hasn't been generators.
02:06:56 Okay.
02:06:57 In order to loop the game, you must destroy the generators and have the throne go super
02:07:03 aggro, and when you kill the throne, you get taken to the throne too, which is, you know,
02:07:07 a baddie, super boss, mega ultra 3D.
02:07:11 Anyway, it didn't used to always be like that.
02:07:14 It used to be you just destroy the throne and you get taken to loop.
02:07:18 Now, this doesn't seem so bad, and in and of themselves, I guess generators aren't exactly
02:07:24 the biggest problem in the universe, but what it implies is what?
02:07:30 Davoo got on the biggest problem in the universe.
02:07:32 Yeah.
02:07:33 Okay.
02:07:34 Well, whatever.
02:07:36 Okay.
02:07:37 The special car is red, right?
02:07:40 Yeah, red and gold.
02:07:41 Sweet.
02:07:42 Yeah, it's a little darker.
02:07:43 Okay.
02:07:44 Everyone stop.
02:07:45 Wait, you died?
02:07:46 I did it.
02:07:47 Wait, did you die?
02:07:48 Turn your follow-up and mute Skype.
02:07:50 Turn your music up.
02:07:51 Turn your music on.
02:07:52 Please.
02:07:53 I died.
02:07:54 Damn.
02:07:55 You're disappointing to me.
02:07:56 Anyway.
02:07:57 But did you get the...
02:07:58 But did you get YV?
02:08:00 I exploded the red car.
02:08:05 No.
02:08:06 No, you're not supposed to explode the red car.
02:08:08 You're supposed to just...
02:08:09 What do you do?
02:08:11 You hit it with the screwdriver and it fixes it.
02:08:13 Oh, and then you get in?
02:08:14 Yeah.
02:08:15 Okay, cool.
02:08:16 It says get in.
02:08:17 Guys, you need to get up in the fact that you're doing a podcast while I'm not paying
02:08:21 attention.
02:08:22 Geez.
02:08:23 All right.
02:08:24 Well...
02:08:25 All right.
02:08:26 Next time.
02:08:27 The reason I don't like this is because loops are pretty much integral to the game and making
02:08:31 it any, at least, somewhat interesting.
02:08:34 Because all of the best weapons you get are like level five and up and you're going to
02:08:37 use it for that long if it's just getting thrown.
02:08:40 Yeah.
02:08:41 That's...
02:08:42 Loops are like my favorite part about this game.
02:08:43 Well, obviously the loops is like the whole thing that keeps it endlessly challenging.
02:08:47 So, yeah, the fact that loops is this very specific requirement is, is, uh, stupid.
02:08:52 Mm-hmm.
02:08:53 I can't believe you actually agreed.
02:08:56 I don't know.
02:08:57 I can't have an opinion until I've actually agreed.
02:08:59 And it's a pain...
02:09:00 I said generators aren't that big of a problem, but they pretty much are.
02:09:03 It's just like an animate object you have to, like, shoot at.
02:09:07 And it doesn't always give you your ammo back.
02:09:10 So it's, like, sometimes, like, not even, like, fun to do it or rewarding.
02:09:15 Because, you know, another...
02:09:16 Because, like, I guess the idea is that they wanted to make loops mysterious or something
02:09:19 where, like, hard to get.
02:09:20 No, no, no, no.
02:09:21 It's not that because when you sit on the throne, you get an ending.
02:09:24 So they wanted to make it a cinematic experience, I'm assuming.
02:09:28 I've never even seen the ending.
02:09:29 I've only seen loops.
02:09:31 Mm-hmm.
02:09:32 So...
02:09:33 So they wanted...
02:09:34 But why would they make it...
02:09:36 Oh, killed by a big rat that's never happened before.
02:09:39 Why would they make it to where the quicker...
02:09:42 The actual ending is easy, but then the looping is hard?
02:09:45 That's to make it mysterious, right?
02:09:46 To make it like, whoa, I actually got even further than expected.
02:09:49 Is that the idea?
02:09:50 To make it like, I'm going beyond...
02:09:52 That sounds...
02:09:53 Like, basically...
02:09:54 That sounds like the idea.
02:09:56 Which doesn't work quite as well when it wasn't already like that in the original version.
02:10:00 So you're, like, mystifying something that wasn't already mysterious.
02:10:02 But even in and of itself, something that Undertale very much convinced me of is that that kind
02:10:08 of crazy going beyond the barriers, freaking, you know, like second half of Girl in the
02:10:13 Lagoon type of stuff, should be easy to get to.
02:10:17 It shouldn't be this crazy thing where you have to do three back flips and then you
02:10:21 will stick a bubble gum on top of a trash can in order to unlock.
02:10:25 Because it's the coolest part of the game, you should just do it easily.
02:10:29 Not like automatically, but do it just enough to where it's easy to get to, because it can
02:10:34 still be just as satisfying.
02:10:36 And there's so much content that's like, restricted to loops.
02:10:40 There's so much content that just some people just won't do, because they don't know.
02:10:46 Like, how do you get the whole second half of Symphony of the Night?
02:10:50 Don't you have to do, like, a specific thing?
02:10:53 Oh, yeah.
02:10:54 I forget.
02:10:55 But it's like, I think you have to...
02:10:58 I have no idea.
02:11:00 It's something like that.
02:11:01 You do have to do some secrets.
02:11:02 Yeah, and it's like, you know, you can make that not crazy secretive and it'll still be
02:11:07 really satisfying.
02:11:08 You'll still feel like you're going against the room.
02:11:10 I don't know, man.
02:11:11 I think it's cool.
02:11:12 I think it's cool that it's, like, hard to find.
02:11:14 I think that makes it more meaningful.
02:11:15 I don't know.
02:11:16 That's what I would have...
02:11:17 Something like Nuclear Throne.
02:11:18 I think it might be different, because you have to do it every time.
02:11:21 Yeah, exactly.
02:11:22 In something like Castlevania, if it's hard to do, that's fine, because you just do it
02:11:27 once, and then you got it.
02:11:28 I guess so.
02:11:29 Yeah.
02:11:30 Because that's how I would have used to feel, but the way the Undertale leads you into it
02:11:33 made me feel like...
02:11:34 Because Undertale does have plenty of things that are crazy obscure to get that are, like,
02:11:38 little things.
02:11:39 So I don't know.
02:11:42 Dude, I've got Rabbits Paw and Scary Face for my first two upgrades.
02:11:46 You're doing it.
02:11:47 Is this the run?
02:11:48 I want one of you to be the Throne on podcast, so you can, like...
02:11:52 That's definitely not going to happen.
02:11:55 I haven't even made it to...
02:11:57 You have to understand, even if I get past Little Hunter, I'm going to get to the freaking
02:12:00 labs, and I'm still not going to be paying attention.
02:12:02 The Palace is super easy.
02:12:03 Well, it was super, until they buffed the Guardians.
02:12:07 It depends.
02:12:08 I've gotten layouts where it's really hard, because it's, like, big and open, and everything
02:12:12 is coming at me from every direction.
02:12:14 Then I've gotten other ones where I'm in, like, a little safe corner, and I can, like,
02:12:18 safely proceed through, and that was really easy.
02:12:20 Oh, well, the Guardians are the ones that, like, shoot the orbs of you.
02:12:22 They used to be really easy, because they only shot one.
02:12:25 And they were...
02:12:26 Those ones aren't so...
02:12:27 I know, but...
02:12:28 It's the ones that jump at you.
02:12:30 Oh, the dogs, yeah.
02:12:31 You know...
02:12:32 Go to PetSmart and get a leash, dude.
02:12:34 The thing about doing the podcast in this format that's pretty insane is the fact that we
02:12:39 all do not have any sense of how long we've been going.
02:12:41 Like, we don't see the time code, so we don't ever feel the urgency to stop, which is funny,
02:12:46 because I could just go on forever.
02:12:48 Yeah, I...
02:12:49 How long have we been...
02:12:50 It's probably been two hours.
02:12:52 Oh, my...
02:12:53 I'm gonna cut this down a bit.
02:12:55 Yeah, have fun cutting it down.
02:12:56 I'll take a while.
02:12:57 Well, I mean, I love, like, seven-hour videos, so to me, this is, like, the perfect video.
02:13:02 Yeah, because for me, I always feel like I'm always able to just talk forever, like, literally.
02:13:06 Yeah.
02:13:07 For I...
02:13:08 It's almost always someone else who leaves or stops a conversation.
02:13:12 My endurance knows no bounds, even when my throat is dying.
02:13:17 Mm-hmm.
02:13:18 Like, if anyone...
02:13:19 I feel you, I feel you.
02:13:20 If anyone who's listened or watched my Q&A would know that even if my throat is dying,
02:13:24 I will still just keep talking into oblivion forever and ever more.
02:13:29 And, oh, my gosh, this level 1-3 is insane right now.
02:13:32 Oh, my gosh.
02:13:33 This level 1-3 is insane?
02:13:35 No, no, no.
02:13:36 This particular version of it.
02:13:37 This particular...
02:13:38 Whoa!
02:13:39 This plane flipped this out of the charts!
02:13:43 Is it...
02:13:44 Is it...
02:13:45 Is there a gold scorpion?
02:13:46 Yeah, there was a gold scorpion before I killed it.
02:13:48 Okay, well, there better be.
02:13:50 But, like, the way the level was arranged was, like, everything was all in a very tightly compact,
02:13:54 like, like, hoop.
02:13:56 It was the most insane 1-3 I've seen.
02:13:59 I'm not saying 1-3 is insane.
02:14:02 I'm saying that particular one was insane 4-1-3.
02:14:05 Come on, guys.
02:14:06 Get the picture.
02:14:07 I get it.
02:14:08 I get it.
02:14:09 We don't hate you yet.
02:14:11 Yeah.
02:14:12 Much.
02:14:13 I'm gonna play YV because I don't feel like trying.
02:14:18 Yeah, the fact that he doesn't actually die, he just gets bored of the failure.
02:14:23 Is that...
02:14:24 That's canonically what happens, yeah.
02:14:26 Yeah.
02:14:27 You know something, I was taking a swig of water, so an enemy was coming toward me.
02:14:31 That's like Kirby.
02:14:32 Kirby never dies.
02:14:33 He just gets bored.
02:14:34 I'm sorry.
02:14:35 I totally steamrolled him up there.
02:14:36 Don't do that.
02:14:37 I was taking a swig of water, and I didn't pause because I don't like pausing.
02:14:40 And then an enemy was coming towards me, and so I'm like, oh, I'll just shoot him.
02:14:43 And it was a grenade launcher, so I died.
02:14:46 Oh, well.
02:14:49 Holy shit.
02:14:50 Like, 40 ravens just, like, they flock, you might say, onto my screen.
02:14:56 Well, I like them when they...
02:14:58 They're okay.
02:14:59 I don't ravens when they have a wrench.
02:15:02 Ravens with a wrench becomes like a whack-a-mole in reverse.
02:15:07 In corridors.
02:15:08 In, like, tight corridors, they're easy.
02:15:10 In, like, a big open space, they're hard.
02:15:12 Ravens are the birds that come down, right?
02:15:14 Yeah.
02:15:15 When you've got a wrench or any other similarly powerful melee weapon, they become whack-a-mole
02:15:19 upside down.
02:15:20 And...
02:15:21 Wrench is like the worst melee weapon.
02:15:24 Why is that the worst melee weapon?
02:15:26 It goes fast and it's fun.
02:15:27 Well, it's...
02:15:28 Well, it's because it's...
02:15:29 I mean, obviously the screwdriver is the worst.
02:15:32 And, like, the wrench is the worst of the acceptable melee weapons.
02:15:38 I mean, a wrench is serviceable in the sewers, but beyond that, it, like, can't kill anything
02:15:44 in one hit.
02:15:45 Freaking try...
02:15:46 Well, I mean, I'm gonna stick with my chicken sword, though, because I get to always have
02:15:51 it.
02:15:52 No, no.
02:15:53 Like, I look for a wrench, like, I want a wrench to get into the sewers, but beyond that, like,
02:15:58 I'm always trying to get a sledgehammer from the shovel.
02:16:01 There is some sense in that, because I built up my affinity for...
02:16:06 What do you mean there's some sense in that?
02:16:07 They're just way better.
02:16:09 That personally applies to me, because I built up my affinity for the wrench when I was beginning
02:16:14 the game and not usually getting very far, not usually getting, you know, to Snowden.
02:16:20 So, obviously, in the couple of times I've used, like, the sledgehammer in the Snow area,
02:16:25 I was getting pretty good use out of it, because, yeah.
02:16:28 So, yeah, I guess I will start planning around using the hammer.
02:16:33 I mean, I just like to kill things in one hit.
02:16:36 And when you got to get really close, like, in a melee situation, it's like, if you can't
02:16:41 kill it in one hit with a melee, it's not worth meleeing.
02:16:44 Well, I don't know about that.
02:16:46 Yeah, especially in the Snow area, because when you hit them once, then they start flying around
02:16:50 if they're not dead yet, and that could cause some damage, so that wouldn't be good, you know.
02:16:54 There's something I was going to say, but I forgot.
02:16:56 Oh, oh, Davoo, I want to, like, record, like, VHS record for future generations.
02:17:02 Your face when you find the Ultra Shovel for the first time.
02:17:06 Let me think.
02:17:07 I've never seen the Ultra Shovel.
02:17:08 I mean, I've probably seen some footage of the Ultra Shovel.
02:17:11 What does it do?
02:17:12 It's a shovel, but ultra.
02:17:16 When did that become, like, established that, like, the system of Super than Ultra?
02:17:22 Like, that was, like, the way it became established.
02:17:25 Well, Ultras are, like, oh, oh, oh, you mean, like, ever?
02:17:30 Yeah, in all of video games.
02:17:31 Like, in language generally.
02:17:33 Yeah, like, was that a video game invention?
02:17:35 I wouldn't be surprised.
02:17:37 It's my first encounter where there was Super Star Saiga.
02:17:41 I'll bet that there was less of a clear hierarchy between the two words before video games came around.
02:17:47 That's one of the cool things about video games in terms of how they benefit culture,
02:17:50 is that it's allowed people to, like, systemize a lot of things that were very abstract before,
02:17:58 but now we think of them as more...
02:18:01 I don't think it allowed us to systemize them.
02:18:03 I think it just demanded more systemization than we had previously.
02:18:06 It just made us more, what I mean is, not allowed, but it made us more inclined to think that way.
02:18:11 You know?
02:18:12 And I like that, that's pretty cool.
02:18:14 Uh, yeah, probably.
02:18:16 For us, us millennials who play video games.
02:18:18 Finally, I have a year...
02:18:19 Hold on, uh...
02:18:20 No, are you gone, Davoo?
02:18:22 Finally, I have the energy weapon upgrade and an energy weapon.
02:18:25 I almost never have both for some reason.
02:18:27 That's good.
02:18:28 Dude, Lisa Brain is good.
02:18:30 Anyway, what I was saying is I completely fucking forgot and Davoo ruined the podcast.
02:18:36 I never get Lisa Brain because I never really use energy weapons,
02:18:40 because they don't seem to do as much damage as they wish they did for their low rate of fire.
02:18:45 To remember what you were saying, just recreate what was being set up to that point.
02:18:48 Like, recreate the scene.
02:18:50 All I can think is black people.
02:18:53 Um...
02:18:55 Melee, Ultra...
02:18:58 Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
02:19:00 This isn't like a thing that you people will have input on, this is just a statement.
02:19:04 What do you mean?
02:19:05 Yeah, you kind of people.
02:19:07 Yeah.
02:19:08 Ultra weapons should be called nuclear weapons.
02:19:10 Just think about that.
02:19:11 Oh, yeah.
02:19:12 Yes, I agree.
02:19:13 I immediately...
02:19:14 I don't even have to think about it.
02:19:15 Everything is nuclear in a way, so...
02:19:17 Although, there is already a nuke launcher.
02:19:21 It's like, what would you have a nuclear nuke launcher?
02:19:23 Dude, wouldn't that be cool?
02:19:25 It would be kind of cool.
02:19:27 I mean, since nuclear stuff is part of the world building,
02:19:30 calling stuff nuclear would be a little inelegant.
02:19:33 Well, the weapons aren't nuclear.
02:19:37 I mean, like, the things are.
02:19:39 I think that is cool.
02:19:42 The only thing that I don't think it would work with is with the nuke launcher,
02:19:46 but, like, whatever.
02:19:47 Just give that one a different name.
02:19:48 Who fucking cares?
02:19:50 Call it a thermonuclear...
02:19:53 Thermonuke.
02:19:54 Yeah, thermo.
02:19:55 Thermo's got to...
02:19:56 How about men's gay and I eat butt?
02:19:57 Everything should be thermo.
02:19:58 How about that?
02:19:59 How about that's the name of it?
02:20:02 No.
02:20:06 Well, over the course of this podcast,
02:20:09 I've become very much into crossbows more than I was before.
02:20:13 Yeah, dude, they're really good.
02:20:15 Yeah, I'm a fan of crossbows.
02:20:17 Because doing really specific aiming where you're, like,
02:20:19 weaving in and out like crazy and the enemies are weaving in and out like crazy
02:20:23 and, like, against all odds that Arrow finds its way to the enemy is pretty sweet.
02:20:29 It's just so satisfying.
02:20:30 It's way more...killing an enemy,
02:20:32 killing, like, a salamander with a heavy crossbow bolt
02:20:35 is way more satisfying than killing them with, like, a bomb.
02:20:39 I don't know why.
02:20:40 Yeah, it's probably the most satisfying killing in the game.
02:20:44 Ben, I don't know how you even, like, survive, like, life using explosive weapons.
02:20:51 You know, here's the thing about...
02:20:52 I only came to that conclusion.
02:20:53 I don't know, dude.
02:20:54 Here's the thing that annoys me about, like, all pro discussions about from pros in games
02:20:58 is that if a weapon or an option is not very effective,
02:21:02 then you're called a pleb for using something that isn't effective.
02:21:04 But in the end, if something is very effective
02:21:06 and you're called a pleb for using something that's too effective,
02:21:09 I don't understand.
02:21:10 I'm not a pro.
02:21:12 Like, you've been shitting on things that are too effective
02:21:16 and then shitting on things that are effective,
02:21:18 and it's like, I don't understand.
02:21:19 Dude, you have to be me.
02:21:22 Or you aren't cool.
02:21:25 The...
02:21:29 Shit, I feel like I had something to say to that.
02:21:31 But it's gone.
02:21:32 That's because I was right.
02:21:35 The... oh yeah, explosives.
02:21:37 I get a lot of good use out of, like, grenade shotguns in Snowden.
02:21:44 I don't know, I just, like, fire them down quarters and...
02:21:47 Whenever you decide to do an explosive run,
02:21:49 make sure to always get boring veins so you don't die.
02:21:53 I never get boiling veins because I'm crystal,
02:21:56 so I feel like only the very low minority of the time
02:22:00 am I going to be at low enough health to benefit from it.
02:22:04 If you, like, get hit at, like, HP 9 or something, you know, high,
02:22:09 it'll still, like, make you not die.
02:22:11 Like, if you, like, get with a point-day explosion when you have full health,
02:22:15 it'll...
02:22:16 Oh, will it make the explosion only bring me down to 4?
02:22:20 Oh, that's really good, then.
02:22:25 That's way better.
02:22:26 I thought, I thought if I was at 5 and got hit with a 5 damage explosion,
02:22:30 that I would die.
02:22:32 Oh, that's so much better than I thought.
02:22:35 Munchie...
02:22:36 Oh, that's so good.
02:22:37 That's a good weapon.
02:22:39 And don't let any of those cocks in the big government tell you otherwise.
02:22:45 Never.
02:22:47 Is it worth getting the homing bolt upgrade if you have the secret pistol?
02:22:53 Yeah, because it's, like, way more accurate than what it does.
02:22:57 Like, when you have, like, the normal, like, without the mutation,
02:23:01 like, you can't shoot down a hallway, but when you have it,
02:23:03 it'll, like, lock on to any of these from very far away.
02:23:06 That's totally worth it.
02:23:07 Yeah, it is hard to shoot it down.
02:23:09 Hey, which aiming reticule do you guys use?
02:23:12 The first one, because it's the best one.
02:23:16 What?
02:23:17 You can choose your aim there, yeah.
02:23:20 What?
02:23:22 Well, for me, I actually go with the YV one.
02:23:25 Partly because it's cool.
02:23:26 Yeah, the YV one is nice.
02:23:28 But also because it's a graphic, it's like an actual thing.
02:23:31 It's YV in the shape, it's like YV's shape with the triangle on the eye.
02:23:36 But because it's an actual graphic, it always catches my eye,
02:23:40 and therefore it's easier to pay attention to it.
02:23:42 When I use any other reticule, I just forget it's there.
02:23:47 Partly because it, like, also the YV one is more solid of a thing.
02:23:51 Like, it's more of a shape that, like, really catches my attention.
02:23:55 And so it's, I never forget where my reticule is,
02:23:58 whereas with using any other ones, I will sometimes forget where I put it.
02:24:06 Yeah, I mean, I don't have a problem because I mostly just aim by, like,
02:24:12 I don't even know.
02:24:13 Like, I don't look at my crosshair ever.
02:24:15 I just kind of infer where I am.
02:24:17 I just shoot blindly, like a child.
02:24:20 Dude, when I get the Steam Controller, this is going to be the first game I try it on.
02:24:23 I just shoot blindly, like a child.
02:24:26 What kind of child are you?
02:24:29 Well, right now.
02:24:31 All of the little kids with their pumped up nuclear thrones.
02:24:35 Chicks, go, run better, run out, run my 2011.
02:24:42 Um, it was a good year.
02:24:45 It was a good year for the internet.
02:24:46 Wait, that song came out in 2011?
02:24:48 Man.
02:24:49 I think so.
02:24:50 I'm feeling 2012, but...
02:24:52 That sounds about right.
02:24:53 Because I remember that was all over the radio when I was in California,
02:24:57 and that's also the year that I picked up Homestuck.
02:25:00 Oh, okay.
02:25:01 Yeah, I don't know.
02:25:02 And so you made Homestuck AMVs based on better run, better run.
02:25:06 Just one or two, yeah.
02:25:10 There's a lot of narrative of fucking...
02:25:13 Something.
02:25:14 I don't know, emotional something there, you know?
02:25:16 The most emotional part in Homestuck is when Carcat gets his shoes stolen.
02:25:20 You know what I'm saying?
02:25:22 I've conceived of more ideas for AMVs than I have watched AMVs.
02:25:28 I don't like anime.
02:25:31 Yeah, I don't really watch AMVs.
02:25:34 I guess I don't seek them out.
02:25:38 But there are lots of times where I'm like,
02:25:39 oh man, I could sync this up with that and it'd be great, but...
02:25:42 Yeah.
02:25:43 In high school, I made a Fully Coolie AMV set to float on by Roddy's mouse.
02:25:50 It was before I knew what an AMV was, so it was still cool back then.
02:25:55 I rammed my mic until it was cool.
02:25:57 It was face of a kid today.
02:26:00 He grew a horn and said, that's not okay.
02:26:08 Is that how the song goes?
02:26:10 That's FLC over here.
02:26:16 What's sad is I feel like I'm pretty decent at coming up with improvised parody lyrics,
02:26:20 but then I can't sing at all.
02:26:23 Oh no.
02:26:25 You might as well just throw yourself off a bridge.
02:26:28 I think I'm pretty good at making parody lyrics.
02:26:30 I can immediately sync up all the syllables and make every line different,
02:26:35 but also syncing up with the theme of the original song and the new parody theme.
02:26:40 Davoo, we all think we're good at something.
02:26:42 It's time you just learned to not think highly of yourself.
02:26:47 It's time you learned that no one has anything.
02:26:49 I am way above average good at making parody lyrics.
02:26:54 And that's quite the skill.
02:26:56 Yeah.
02:26:57 Well look, I mean, obviously by the fact that I don't do it often,
02:27:02 it proves that I understand its lack of usefulness.
02:27:08 You know who thinks they're really good at singing?
02:27:12 Christian Weston Chandler.
02:27:14 He has described her voice as having a quote unquote Bing Crosby flavor,
02:27:23 but she's totally toned out.
02:27:27 I mean, I've watched enough videos of her trying to sing.
02:27:30 Wait, she's identifying as female now?
02:27:32 I didn't know about this.
02:27:34 I went to the Sonichu Wiki and I didn't mention that.
02:27:39 By the way, I went to the Sonichu...
02:27:41 Oh no, well they might still call her Christian there,
02:27:43 because I mean, that's how they've always referred.
02:27:45 I mean, I still think of him as Christian.
02:27:47 I still think of him as a guy, honestly,
02:27:49 because that's how I always read about him.
02:27:51 Did you hear about how he got arrested?
02:27:54 Oh yeah, dude.
02:27:55 I mean, which time he's been arrested?
02:27:57 I've heard of Sonichu years ago,
02:28:00 but it seems like you guys really keep up on your CWC information.
02:28:05 No, it's me, man.
02:28:07 I am a fucking scholar.
02:28:09 I am a fucking scholar of Christian.
02:28:12 My junior and senior year of college,
02:28:16 following the adventures of him was my main hobby.
02:28:19 I even tried to make a fan game about him.
02:28:22 I made an RPG maker game based on one of his own games.
02:28:25 And I actually did a shit ton of sprites.
02:28:28 Wait, did you post that anywhere?
02:28:30 I think I remember seeing.
02:28:32 No, no, no.
02:28:34 There are other versions of it that were made.
02:28:36 I never post them.
02:28:37 You see, I can be fascinated by the autism universe,
02:28:41 but then I get...
02:28:42 It's something that I only appreciate in spurts.
02:28:44 It's not something I can stew in.
02:28:46 It's not like...
02:28:49 I was in the chat, introduced me to the new storyteller,
02:28:52 and I was so into him for like 30 minutes.
02:28:55 I did subscribe, but then I unsubscribed.
02:28:57 No, it's not the same.
02:29:00 The new storyteller...
02:29:01 I mean, I haven't watched his videos,
02:29:03 but he just makes ridiculous videos.
02:29:06 Christian Weston Chandler not only makes this ridiculous content,
02:29:09 but he also had this bizarre narrative surrounding him.
02:29:12 Okay, you know Max Landis' video about where he condenses down
02:29:17 the whole story of Triple H?
02:29:20 I could do that.
02:29:21 And I actually think I almost want to do that for Chris.
02:29:24 But you should draw it in the style of Sonichu.
02:29:30 Maybe, maybe, I don't know.
02:29:32 But okay, here's the thing.
02:29:33 The story of Chris is like professional wrestling
02:29:37 in that it's a bunch of people playing characters.
02:29:39 The only thing is that the main character doesn't know it's an X.
02:29:43 June Show crossed with wrestling.
02:29:45 Yes.
02:29:47 I've never described it that way before,
02:29:49 but that's a really elegant way of describing it.
02:29:51 I'm really impressed with myself right now.
02:29:53 Yeah, it's like a big circus,
02:29:55 but the main character doesn't know it's all an X.
02:29:57 He really believed that all these ridiculous characters were contacting him
02:30:02 and that Shigeru Miyamoto was talking to him about getting his game,
02:30:06 his comic license for a video game.
02:30:08 And he thought that Reggie Philzheim and Jay-Z
02:30:12 and all these famous people were talking to him.
02:30:15 And he had like, have I told you about, there was the liquid side where a guy,
02:30:22 yeah, this guy, just for fun, for his own time, he wasn't trying to mess with anyone.
02:30:27 He just made videos where he pretended to be Chris
02:30:30 and put them up for his friends to enjoy.
02:30:32 But people found the vids and sent them to Chris
02:30:35 and pretended that this was the guy who was actually trying to impersonate him.
02:30:39 And so Chris got really upset and challenged the so-called imposter
02:30:43 to a karaoke contest to determine who was the real Chris.
02:30:48 And the fake Chris crushed him.
02:30:50 Wow.
02:30:52 And the story just goes on.
02:30:54 It's like years and years of people playing these roles
02:30:57 and just duping Chris into believing that these outlandish things are happening.
02:31:02 Wait, I need to talk directly to you, Ben.
02:31:04 This isn't directly related to a Christian,
02:31:07 but have you heard of a man named Jace W. Connors?
02:31:12 Otherwise known as ParkourDude91.
02:31:16 No, I've never heard of him.
02:31:18 I think I might have sent you a video of him at one point in my life.
02:31:21 Wait, wait, was he the guy who was like, you gotta follow your bliss?
02:31:24 No, no.
02:31:25 You gotta follow your bliss.
02:31:26 That guy actually knows him.
02:31:28 Oh.
02:31:29 But we'll see, ParkourDude, we found out it was an act.
02:31:32 But anyway, it's a really fucking good act.
02:31:35 And the one that I'm gonna link you one day, it's this guy.
02:31:38 Hey, speaking of, oh man, I got interrupted.
02:31:40 Speaking of really good acts, have you ever heard of My Immortal?
02:31:44 Yeah.
02:31:45 Yes, I know about My Immortal.
02:31:47 I'm pretty sure it's an act, but it's pretty good.
02:31:49 It may have been sincere, like, at first, somewhat,
02:31:53 but it definitely became a comedy thing.
02:31:56 That's probably my favorite autism thing that I was into for a while.
02:32:00 But, Munchy, what were you saying about the...
02:32:03 ParkourDude91 is this character where he's supposed to be a 420 gamer.
02:32:11 That's his character, and he's really into Parkour,
02:32:14 and he thinks he's a marine, even though he's never been in the army.
02:32:23 And he'll say, I'm a disabled and wounded veteran.
02:32:28 I need to keep you with respect.
02:32:30 But all of those things contradict everything else.
02:32:34 Being into drugs, being into Parkour, and being a wounded veteran.
02:32:37 None of those things are compatible.
02:32:39 I know, but see, it makes this...
02:32:41 That's intentional, oh my gosh, that's brilliant.
02:32:43 It makes such a convincing case, because those are all the things
02:32:47 that people who play shit like Call of Duty extensively,
02:32:51 and all that Xbox Doritos culture,
02:32:55 it all culminates into this character this person made,
02:32:58 who continued to be like...
02:33:01 He kept up this for like two years, I think it was,
02:33:05 making constant videos.
02:33:07 One time he flipped his car, and he said he was in a drag race,
02:33:12 and his Prius couldn't perform.
02:33:16 And he got mad at his car, yeah.
02:33:19 In the bedroom.
02:33:20 He's so insane.
02:33:21 I would like to see some of this dude.
02:33:26 I'm going to give you my favorite one, it's called The Hater Hit List.
02:33:29 Here's the thing, I think people who are able to convincingly put on an act like that,
02:33:33 and then keep it up for a couple of years,
02:33:35 they have to also be somewhat insane.
02:33:37 Because that's the thing, anyone who can come up with the idea
02:33:40 of I'm going to play a crazy artist,
02:33:42 and then you will get bored of it immediately, that's what I do anyway.
02:33:46 And I'm just thinking, people who can actually keep up that act,
02:33:49 the lines blur just a smidge as to whether or not you're actually insane.
02:33:54 People who are able to keep doing it convincingly,
02:33:56 and not go insane doing it, to not be bored.
02:34:01 Some like, I mean, do you guys know Froggy Fresh, the rapper?
02:34:06 I know of him.
02:34:07 AKA Krispy Kreme?
02:34:08 Yeah, well, he released these famously terrible raps.
02:34:14 But the thing is, they were just good enough that they actually sounded kind of good,
02:34:20 even though the lyrics were embarrassing.
02:34:23 I mean, it's still an open question.
02:34:27 Nobody really knows, but I am one of the people that comes down on this.
02:34:31 I kind of think he was faking it.
02:34:32 I think that Froggy Fresh is a character.
02:34:35 But no one believes me.
02:34:36 Everyone else thinks he's legit.
02:34:37 And maybe he doesn't.
02:34:38 You know, someone like the new storyteller is,
02:34:41 there's no way that can't be legit, because it's not that funny.
02:34:46 It's not, like, the level of effort that it takes
02:34:49 versus the amount of funniness that it is, is just too diminishing of returns, you know?
02:34:54 So there's no way that's not funny.
02:34:56 I mean, full disclosure, I didn't actually watch any of his storytellers videos.
02:35:01 Brilliant.
02:35:02 I love him.
02:35:03 I think he's boring, honestly.
02:35:06 I think he's, like, whatever.
02:35:07 Well, he's not like someone who you could endlessly come back to or anything.
02:35:10 He's not that interesting that you could just always enjoy him.
02:35:13 But, like, his voice, he has some major speech empowerment.
02:35:18 I really feel like he must have been the inspiration for Bane, the new one.
02:35:22 The way he talks.
02:35:24 Like, I just feel like Christopher Nolan.
02:35:25 Bane?
02:35:26 Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
02:35:28 The new Bane.
02:35:30 Like, Christopher Nolan, like, watched the new storyteller,
02:35:34 and was like, that guy is really cool.
02:35:36 You know, I can see that.
02:35:38 Christopher Nolan has a famous taste in what cool voices are sounding like.
02:35:43 You know?
02:35:44 This is a cool voice.
02:35:45 And so is this.
02:35:46 Everyone is cool in my world.
02:35:52 Oh, oh, man.
02:35:54 A snow golem blew up, and I almost died, but I was okay.
02:35:57 I like how we're all still playing Nukia from.
02:36:00 Yeah.
02:36:01 I thought...
02:36:02 I'm actually getting into the swing of talking and not even thinking about what's going on
02:36:05 in the game.
02:36:06 And I'm not doing that great, but, you know, I'm getting better.
02:36:08 Like, I'm actually making it to snow.
02:36:09 I am shocked at how good this is and how this is actually making all of our conversation
02:36:13 better, I think.
02:36:14 Yeah.
02:36:15 It makes me realize that Sam's the noises, not the skeleton.
02:36:20 This is a great setup for a podcast, you know, other than...
02:36:24 Do you want to, like, make this a thing?
02:36:26 I, you know, I've been thinking that.
02:36:28 I mean, I really...
02:36:30 Oh, shit.
02:36:31 I just killed a little hunter.
02:36:32 Good job, dude.
02:36:33 Yeah, boy.
02:36:35 I mean, I think this is obviously a lot less entertaining to listen to than we think,
02:36:39 because any boring parts are, we then start playing the game more seriously
02:36:43 when we aren't talking.
02:36:44 Oh, absolutely.
02:36:45 This isn't going to come out.
02:36:46 That's why I'm saying, like, even though I'm having a good time, I'm definitely going
02:36:49 to have to edit this down.
02:36:51 Like, honestly, we've, honestly, we've spent a disproportionate amount of this podcast
02:36:55 talking about this podcast, and I think I'm going to try and trim some of that.
02:36:59 Because I'm...
02:37:00 I think I'm just amazed that it's not like that, like, it's not, like, incredibly boring
02:37:05 and we're not even, like, saying anything.
02:37:07 Yeah.
02:37:08 No.
02:37:09 We haven't had much radio silence, which is a victory.
02:37:12 Victory.
02:37:13 Dot, dot, dot.
02:37:14 Blood launcher.
02:37:15 Oh, do that.
02:37:16 I don't even know what that is.
02:37:18 It won't hurt you unless you want it out of ammo.
02:37:20 And if you try to shoot it when you don't have ammo, it, like, it, like, will shoot,
02:37:23 but it won't, like, it'll take damage.
02:37:26 Oh.
02:37:27 Well, then I just won't use it with no ammo.
02:37:31 Sweet.
02:37:32 If you get the cannon, it's a much better version.
02:37:36 Well, I can only do what I can do.
02:37:39 Like, the, like, blood explosions that it shoots, it won't hurt you, and it destroys projectiles,
02:37:44 like enemy projectiles.
02:37:46 Yeah, yeah.
02:37:48 Nice.
02:37:49 Well, I found my new favorite weapon.
02:37:55 How often do you guys go in the pizza sewers?
02:38:00 I've never gone to the pizza sewers.
02:38:02 Is that the place with the turtles?
02:38:04 Yeah, I've been there a couple times and I don't know what the point is.
02:38:07 The way weapons drop in this game, every portal you go into ups the tier of weapons you get.
02:38:15 So if you go in one more portal, that means you'll get one, like, slightly better weapons.
02:38:22 Holy shit, that's so cool.
02:38:24 Because I've always been fascinated by the way it'll show the map of levels that you're going through
02:38:28 and how going through a side portal will show a distraction.
02:38:31 Like, I always felt like there must have been some more significance to that.
02:38:34 Yeah, I know.
02:38:35 That is some freaking cool stuff, man.
02:38:39 Now, I'm going to tell you something that will blow your mind.
02:38:42 Okay.
02:38:43 Robot, his, like, passability is that he gets one tier better weapons.
02:38:48 Okay.
02:38:49 I see.
02:38:50 Now, if you go into the pizza sewers, you go into both of the vault portals.
02:38:55 And since, uh, cursed weapons can appear, like, two tier more weapons.
02:39:01 And, like, say if I get a cursed chest and, like, one-one, I can get a one-three weapon.
02:39:08 So it's like that.
02:39:09 If I do all those things, I can get a cursed super plasma cannon,
02:39:13 which happens on the throne in, uh, two-two.
02:39:16 Or, I mean, in, uh, five-two.
02:39:18 Wow.
02:39:19 Yeah.
02:39:20 That's pretty cool.
02:39:21 So it's great how that works.
02:39:23 Yo, relevant about the pizza sewers, because I haven't been there,
02:39:26 but I checked out the music for it.
02:39:28 And that's the music I used at the beginning of my video.
02:39:31 That's the only weapon, yeah.
02:39:33 I mean, the only music that I genuinely like a lot.
02:39:36 Yeah.
02:39:37 Besides the Venus Mansion music, which you'll see why I like that.
02:39:40 Yeah, I've listened to that, too.
02:39:41 Okay.
02:39:42 I listened to almost all the OST in, um, when making the video.
02:39:45 And I ended up going for the pizza sewers for the first half of the video.
02:39:48 And so, obviously, it sounds exactly like the music for the-
02:39:53 Shit!
02:39:54 God fucking damn it!
02:39:56 The thing-
02:39:57 Did you win?
02:39:58 Damn, it killed by a horror dog.
02:39:59 I mean, thank you, man, y'all.
02:40:01 Hee-hee.
02:40:02 I was on, ugh.
02:40:03 I was in the- I was in the darn.
02:40:05 I was in 7-1.
02:40:06 That was the best I've done so far.
02:40:08 Well, hey, getting better.
02:40:09 I think we're, like, we're training you.
02:40:11 We're-
02:40:12 I guess so.
02:40:13 This is, like, this is the longest I've played at a stretch in, like, maybe ever.
02:40:16 Dude, I play this game for hours on end, and I have no friends.
02:40:19 I-
02:40:20 I have been going in, like, short spurts, which is not usually how I play games.
02:40:24 Usually I fucking marathon them.
02:40:26 But nuclear throne, I've been more like, oh, I'll play, like, four or five games,
02:40:29 then I get bored and I go do something else.
02:40:30 I can't wait until you guys unlock hard mode.
02:40:33 Yeah, there is.
02:40:35 Is there a hard mode?
02:40:36 Okay, so the thing about the pizza sewers music is that it sounds-
02:40:39 I don't know if this is obvious to everyone, like it is to me.
02:40:41 It sounds exactly like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles NES game music.
02:40:45 Which-
02:40:46 Well, yeah.
02:40:47 That's probably intentional.
02:40:48 Yeah, yeah.
02:40:49 But, like, the thing about that that was so impressive to me is, one, the fact that-
02:40:52 The most impressive thing about that to me is that the Ninja Turtles NES game music
02:41:00 was its own distinct sound.
02:41:02 Which is something that I wouldn't have thought about.
02:41:04 That-
02:41:05 That Ninja Turtles NES game music was a distinct sound.
02:41:09 That could be imitated with a new song.
02:41:12 That was, like, really made me reflect on NES music.
02:41:18 8-bit chiptune.
02:41:20 And the observational powers prowess of Lambeer, whoever made that song.
02:41:27 Like, it's such a specific thing.
02:41:29 I couldn't-
02:41:30 I don't know.
02:41:31 He probably just identified some, like, key riffs in it.
02:41:35 No, like, the way that the instruments are set up, I don't know what the terminology
02:41:41 is for chiptune, but the way that it's done is, like, the way the synths blare out is
02:41:47 similar.
02:41:48 But maybe there's some similar melody going on as well.
02:41:51 I don't know, man.
02:41:52 I listen to quite a bit of chiptune, and there are different types.
02:41:56 There are chiptune.
02:41:57 I'm always fascinated.
02:41:58 Have any of you guys ever heard, like, a chiptune remix that's, like, really low energy?
02:42:03 It's, like, it's almost like a lullaby.
02:42:06 Yeah, I hate those.
02:42:07 I can't stand those.
02:42:09 Well, you know, I hate it when I'm looking for an exciting one and I get a lullaby.
02:42:14 Like, before my body is dry, chiptune is like that.
02:42:18 And it's, like, I do appreciate the unique tone that that gives it, but I want a real
02:42:23 one, and I feel like people are demotivated to make one because that one exists.
02:42:28 So it's, it's, I feel like it's deprived the earth of a proper chiptune.
02:42:32 Don't lose your way.
02:42:34 I feel like pixel art and chiptune, by nature, should be energetic.
02:42:39 It needs energy.
02:42:40 It needs strength.
02:42:41 It needs stamina.
02:42:42 Those do not have the strength.
02:42:43 Don't have the stamina.
02:42:44 Dark souls.
02:42:46 Dark souls.
02:42:48 This is pixel shit.
02:42:50 You heard it here, folks.
02:42:52 Why?
02:42:53 Why?
02:42:54 I was embodying Trump.
02:42:56 I was talking about pixel art that doesn't have energy, doesn't have the strength or
02:43:00 the stamina to be part of the indie scene.
02:43:03 I saw on the, on the Asanshu Wiki that, that CWC was opposed to Trump.
02:43:08 And, you know, that was pretty, pretty influential.
02:43:12 CWC doesn't have his own opinions.
02:43:14 CWC.
02:43:15 He's a god.
02:43:17 He just, he just parrot, he just parrots things.
02:43:19 It's like whatever.
02:43:21 The only thing you can consistently count on him to do is hate men, mostly gay ones.
02:43:25 That's true.
02:43:26 And without good reason.
02:43:28 I mean, or with good reason.
02:43:31 He has, he has some kind of weird line.
02:43:33 He'll sometimes say about how his like principal in elementary school like molested him, but
02:43:39 I don't believe it for a second.
02:43:41 I think it's some lie.
02:43:42 I think, I think his, I think his dad like made up the story or like grossly exaggerates
02:43:47 the story.
02:43:48 They only molested him a little bit.
02:43:49 Some like weird southern agenda.
02:43:51 Like there, there was one time where a counselor said, where did they touch him?
02:43:54 Where did, where did they touch you?
02:43:55 And he pointed to like some really inoffensive place and like, oh, okay, you can go home now.
02:43:59 That was a pretty okay place to be touched.
02:44:02 I get the feel.
02:44:03 Okay.
02:44:04 Now I'm just kind of going off of my vague memories here, but I'm pretty sure he just,
02:44:07 he talks about like that the, the principal like made him sit on his lap, which is not
02:44:12 necessarily an inappropriate thing to do with the kid, but he says it as though it's like,
02:44:17 you know, this weird gross section.
02:44:19 I don't know man.
02:44:20 The only way that I can follow an asshole and like study them is if they do something
02:44:28 that's cool and I like them.
02:44:30 Dude, Sonichu is cool and I like it.
02:44:33 Maybe.
02:44:34 That's why, that's why I can follow Chris because I can get, I can follow him through
02:44:38 the lens.
02:44:39 Okay.
02:44:40 Like the only person who I study and dislike is movie Bob because I mean like, I don't
02:44:45 know, maybe overall he's an okay person, but there's so many things about them that
02:44:48 are jerky that make me mad, but his reviews are just a little bit too good that I can't
02:44:53 keep, I have to keep coming back to them.
02:44:56 So then as a result, I have to, yeah, he's, he's got you by the balls over the last four
02:45:00 years.
02:45:01 I've had to analyze him to understand why he's like that and he's not, you know, he's
02:45:04 not that big of a jerk.
02:45:05 It's just that like, I think his prop, his capacity to be a jerk is probably not significantly
02:45:10 higher than most people.
02:45:12 It's just that he's willing to let it ruin his videos, which no one else is willing to
02:45:16 do.
02:45:17 Like anyone who makes good videos doesn't want their jerky tendencies to ruin them.
02:45:22 They'll put their asshole in this aside.
02:45:25 I know I do.
02:45:26 I don't know, man.
02:45:27 His videos are all about his opinion.
02:45:29 Well, it's not, it's not the same thing I would have to, if you want me to, I could
02:45:36 go into an in depth explanation, but I don't think I want to hear it like the way he does
02:45:41 it is not quite the same.
02:45:44 But I guess you may have, you may have tapped into the way he sees it though.
02:45:52 I mean, yeah, I'm not sure.
02:45:54 I'm not sure what you want from him.
02:45:55 I mean, if he's, if he's a guy with shitty opinions and his videos are opinion pieces.
02:46:00 Well, yeah, it's not like I've ever told him, like, calm and didn't stop doing this.
02:46:04 But if he'll be pissing me off and pissing me off and I could explain it, but you know,
02:46:08 I don't, I don't want to get into all of that.
02:46:11 I mean, he's not like someone like say Sargon of Akkad, whose videos are shitty and obnoxious,
02:46:16 even aside from their content.
02:46:18 Just the format of them is obnoxious and shitty.
02:46:23 That's part of it.
02:46:24 Like if you were like really tightly written, like the flaws in his writing and the, is
02:46:30 like really the, they're intertwined.
02:46:32 This is like an intertwined issue.
02:46:35 The flaws of his writing and the writing itself are too, are too closely linked to it.
02:46:41 Yeah, yeah, I know.
02:46:42 I do each other.
02:46:44 I don't know.
02:46:45 I mean, I don't really get it.
02:46:47 I don't want to.
02:46:48 I feel like I could go on too long.
02:46:49 I mean, I'm not, I'm not even that big on movie Bob hating.
02:46:52 I'm mostly been exacerbated in it because Digipro has been ragging on movie Bob lately.
02:46:57 So that's kind of amped me up, but being like, yeah, frickin movie Bob.
02:47:01 Exactly.
02:47:02 But I really haven't been mad at him in a while, except for that one time where I watched one
02:47:06 of his videos and then turned it off because I got so mad.
02:47:08 But I don't like, I have a frickin life now.
02:47:11 I don't frickin.
02:47:12 All right.
02:47:13 I picked up the shovel.
02:47:14 I, I forwent, I forwent, I forwent my, my chicken sword to get a shovel.
02:47:22 Now I'm at five one.
02:47:24 So hopefully I can find a screwdriver somewhere around these parts.
02:47:27 Oh wow.
02:47:28 Shovel on five two.
02:47:29 Best weapon in the game.
02:47:31 Munchie.
02:47:32 You're on the West coast, right?
02:47:34 What time is it?
02:47:35 12.
02:47:36 Oh my God.
02:47:38 Okay.
02:47:39 Using a melee weapon to hit the robo snipers bullets back at them is like, probably like
02:47:48 my favorite gaming thing to do in a game of 2015 that isn't in Undertale.
02:47:53 Like, like that is the most, I sometimes I would just sit there for a while and just
02:47:59 do that constantly.
02:48:00 Just, just hit them, hit the bullets back, hit the bullets back.
02:48:04 Unfortunately, I'm a little baby crystal, so I don't have to do that.
02:48:08 I can just shield them back at them, which is also pretty cool.
02:48:11 I like how it's significantly lower than it kills them.
02:48:13 It's like self like worth just by calling him a baby crystal.
02:48:16 Well, but I accidentally triggered the ICC.
02:48:18 Well, I mean, I mean, no, be IPPC, whatever.
02:48:20 You see, you see the reason why is because on, is because on some level I already knew
02:48:25 it.
02:48:26 So when you said it, it just, it just.
02:48:29 Like, if I didn't really, if I didn't deep in my heart know that I was a little baddie
02:48:33 for playing crystal, I wouldn't be bothered by you saying it.
02:48:36 But because I know it's true, it hurts.
02:48:38 Dude, Otto Crospo, Crino.
02:48:41 Oh, it's so good.
02:48:43 There's an Otto Crospo.
02:48:44 Yeah.
02:48:45 Whoops.
02:48:46 Oh, I went, I went into the green portal.
02:48:48 They got to the throne room.
02:48:50 Whatever you call that thing, the green portal.
02:48:53 Oh yeah, the chronicle.
02:48:55 All right.
02:48:56 So now it's time to make a choose here.
02:48:58 No HP drops.
02:48:59 Big age.
02:49:00 PGS more common.
02:49:01 Get curse weapon chests.
02:49:04 Get the cursed one.
02:49:06 Because that's the best.
02:49:07 A lot more curse chests.
02:49:08 Yeah.
02:49:09 Okay, fine.
02:49:10 Why?
02:49:11 Because curse chests are like good.
02:49:13 There's like not a big downside of them.
02:49:15 Like not being able to drop them.
02:49:16 Like if it's a good weapon, why would you want to drop it?
02:49:18 Dude, the Otto Crospo is the new stage of life.
02:49:22 I know.
02:49:23 It's so good.
02:49:24 Do you know what?
02:49:25 Do you know what?
02:49:26 Do you know what?
02:49:27 If you pick last wish while you have a curse weapon.
02:49:29 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:49:30 It's nice.
02:49:31 Because you see, the only problem with Crospo is that they don't have a rapid fire, but
02:49:37 then the Otto Crospo negates that problem.
02:49:39 Oh my gosh.
02:49:40 There's a heavy Otto Crospo.
02:49:41 Well, but then it introduces the new problem that you run out of ammo for.
02:49:46 Well, all you have to do is just not hit the button that often.
02:49:51 Not a...
02:49:52 Are you saying that even three-year-olds can serve their ammo in nuclear thrones?
02:49:57 That big dog.
02:49:58 Oh boy.
02:49:59 Oh man.
02:50:00 How long have you been alive?
02:50:02 Like two months?
02:50:06 Roughly.
02:50:07 That's, you know, that's within two orders of magnitude of the correct answer.
02:50:12 So yeah.
02:50:13 Right.
02:50:14 Now the Otto Crospo and Trigger Fingers.
02:50:16 This is going to be intense.
02:50:19 I'm playing fish right now.
02:50:21 Which do I want, Munchie?
02:50:22 Do I want the regular Crospo or the Splinter Pistol?
02:50:25 Splinter Pistol.
02:50:27 Thanks to my Otto Crospo, I faced right down against the crystal that was aiming its bullet at me.
02:50:34 I didn't flinch.
02:50:35 I didn't try to run away.
02:50:36 I just kept firing my Crospo at it.
02:50:38 I love when, like, you're scared of an enemy, but then you get a good weapon.
02:50:41 You can just mow them down and you just feel like you're like a Samarian god of life-taker
02:50:46 aware.
02:50:47 Oh.
02:50:48 Life-taker aware.
02:50:49 God.
02:50:50 Except I'm now only HP.
02:50:52 So I better, I'm being careful again.
02:50:54 Okay.
02:50:55 What were you saying, Ben?
02:50:58 I was trying to think of a, I was trying to think of a joke.
02:51:01 It's hard though.
02:51:02 I'm not smart.
02:51:03 We all know that Ben isn't funny.
02:51:05 So we just invited him and this podcast just to make him feel better about himself.
02:51:10 I was going to say, like, for example, oh man, I took a, like, I had, I had real severe
02:51:19 diarrhea earlier today.
02:51:21 I felt like a, I felt like a total Sumerian god of taking a shit.
02:51:28 That's what you sound like.
02:51:30 Also, I have a cursed jackhammer.
02:51:32 So what the heck is up with cursed weapons?
02:51:34 What do cursed weapons do?
02:51:36 You can't drop them.
02:51:38 You just can't drop them.
02:51:40 You can still switch them.
02:51:41 Yeah, yeah.
02:51:42 If you find another cursed weapon that you like more, you can switch out cursed weapons.
02:51:45 Oh, that's cool.
02:51:48 I'm going to pass.
02:51:50 I'm going to stay.
02:51:51 I'm going to stay.
02:51:52 Yeah.
02:51:53 Really?
02:51:54 You get a thing called cursed ammo.
02:51:55 What the frick?
02:51:56 Oh my gosh.
02:51:57 Whoa.
02:51:58 I got to 5-1 and it's a mostly open environment with like half the enemies of the level all
02:52:05 right there.
02:52:06 Yeah.
02:52:07 I have paused.
02:52:08 That's what I'm talking about.
02:52:09 I have paused.
02:52:10 I need to take this in for a moment.
02:52:13 That's what I was saying before, like a huge flock of crows just like flew down at me all
02:52:17 at once.
02:52:18 It's the worst.
02:52:19 That's crazy.
02:52:20 It's like most of the enemies.
02:52:22 Grab a triple machine gun.
02:52:24 Big robot guys that slide around.
02:52:27 It's like seven of them.
02:52:29 In my immediate vision, the moment I spawn, I'm still paused.
02:52:33 I need to take this in.
02:52:34 I'm going to go refill my water.
02:52:36 Maybe I'll go to the bathroom.
02:52:38 Well, anyway.
02:52:39 Yeah, whatever.
02:52:40 Cursed ammo, it explodes if you don't get it in time.
02:52:42 Don't get it in time, but it gives you more ammo per drop.
02:52:45 All right.
02:52:46 See you for a minute.
02:52:47 Oh, you mean the item on the ground explodes?
02:52:54 Interesting.
02:52:55 Well, yeah, I have not found a single cursed weapon.
02:53:00 Maybe that's normal.
02:53:01 Well, you need a crown in order to...
02:53:04 Oh, wait.
02:53:05 You only get them with the crown?
02:53:06 I don't like it either, but whatever.
02:53:09 I'm not the maker of the game.
02:53:10 My name's not J.W.
02:53:15 J.W. Bush.
02:53:16 Yeah, George Bush made nuclear throne.
02:53:18 He made it as his foreman.
02:53:22 George Weedman, creator of nuclear...
02:53:24 Edward Snowden, creator of nuclear throne.
02:53:28 Edward...
02:53:29 John...
02:53:30 John Edward Snow.
02:53:32 We could do this all day, folks.
02:53:35 Oh, and we will.
02:53:37 We've already gone for like three hours.
02:53:41 Holy shit.
02:53:42 All right.
02:53:43 This is the run.
02:53:44 Okay.
02:53:45 I'm going to hold you to that.
02:53:46 Oh, shit, my nigga.
02:53:47 Because I've got gamma guts.
02:53:48 And I'm just running over maggots right now, and it feels...
02:53:53 It's filling me with determination.
02:53:56 Oh, that wasn't the last enemy?
02:53:59 Okay.
02:54:00 Oh, and this time, you know where I'm going?
02:54:02 I'm going to...
02:54:04 I'm going to gosh dang...
02:54:08 I'm going to...
02:54:10 I mean, young Venus.
02:54:11 Okay.
02:54:12 The car.
02:54:13 I'm going to the car.
02:54:14 Yeah.
02:54:15 You said that the car spawns on 5 or...
02:54:17 3-1.
02:54:18 Yeah, 3-1.
02:54:19 3-1?
02:54:20 3-1?
02:54:21 Okay.
02:54:22 Have you ever picked up a golden weapon before?
02:54:26 Yeah, I...
02:54:28 Wait, no.
02:54:29 No.
02:54:30 I just had YV's gold pistol.
02:54:32 Well, gold weapons, if you take it to an enemy portal and you start a new level with it after you pick it up,
02:54:39 then it will store and it will always be selected right from the start of a run with that character forever.
02:54:46 If you just take it to the next level.
02:54:48 If you just beat a level with it, yeah.
02:54:50 Nice.
02:54:51 With it in your inventory, yeah.
02:54:53 Okay, well, I guess I should try to do that then.
02:54:55 Well, I mean, the tier 1 gold weapons, which are in the mansion, aren't super good,
02:55:00 but there are ones that are on loop that are really good.
02:55:05 But I still think it would be nice.
02:55:07 Right now, I have a slugger for eyes and it's really nice.
02:55:13 Shit.
02:55:14 I missed that.
02:55:15 Alright.
02:55:16 I'm back.
02:55:17 Good.
02:55:18 Alright.
02:55:19 That's good.
02:55:20 I need to create a battle plan.
02:55:21 I'm gonna switch to my autocrossbow and then run to the right and start firing like crazy.
02:55:26 Whoops, I did not...
02:55:27 That's good.
02:55:28 Now I'm running and now I'm shooting my autocrossbow and now I'm dying and I got my health back
02:55:32 so now I'm not dying anymore and now I'm dying again.
02:55:35 So now I am dying and then I got some health back and so now I'm alive again and now I'm
02:55:38 not dying and now I'm out of bullets and now...
02:55:40 I was not speeding that up in my commentary.
02:55:43 That's how fast all that just happened.
02:55:45 Okay, now I got some more health and now I'm well...
02:55:47 Now I have half health and...
02:55:48 Okay.
02:55:49 Wow.
02:55:50 I kind of wish I'd been filming that because that was the most incredible thing that's ever
02:55:53 happened in my life and now I'm down to one health.
02:55:56 And I still...
02:55:57 You're making it?
02:55:58 No place for cover really.
02:55:59 Oh, freaking health health health health health health health health health health health health.
02:56:01 Oh, I got some health, alright.
02:56:03 Oh, my gosh.
02:56:04 Oh, man.
02:56:05 That was...
02:56:06 Oh, now I got some more health.
02:56:07 Aw, yeah.
02:56:08 Aw, freaking...
02:56:09 Now I got more health.
02:56:10 Now I have almost full health and oh, my gosh.
02:56:12 That was...
02:56:13 Oh, man.
02:56:14 I was so engrossed with your story that I actually believed that I was at one health.
02:56:18 Do you want to remake The Christmas Carol with me?
02:56:22 Because...
02:56:25 I
02:56:27 You know that those kinds of those kind of decisions you need we need to think about them carefully
02:56:34 Before we take that kind of step in our relationship
02:56:36 Your gift of gab in your story made me think you're just a such a great
02:56:41 Remake the Christmas carol for a modern audience. What a great story. Oh, I'm dying. I'm alive now. I'm dying
02:56:48 That's the magic
02:56:50 Okay, I don't know what the hell this guy wants. I don't even care
02:56:54 That's the match. That's really that's my chicken right there
02:56:57 Is that I became alive and in dead in the live again multiple times only?
02:57:03 Talking
02:57:07 Munchie, I just shamed myself. Do you know how I died? I
02:57:11 Tried to eat. I tried. I tried to use gamma. Oh
02:57:14 Man
02:57:16 Yep. Oh well. Yep. It was good. I did it and it worked. What do you know? I wish one game
02:57:23 It's the one that it's when enemies touch you they kill you and snipers are the ones that when they die
02:57:27 Yeah, I had to die up a handful of times before on
02:57:31 That's the other thing I like about them. I like about
02:57:35 These kinds of games this you know down well this kind of this sort of new bird age of
02:57:41 I
02:57:42 Roguelikes is that my favorite way to learn how to do anything is to fail five times first
02:57:48 But the problem is that you know fail a bunch of times is really frustrating
02:57:51 So in a roguelike where failing is like, yeah, I get a fresh start
02:57:54 So failing feels like cool. So I get to learn exclusively through failure, you know, like I don't
02:58:01 It is all about learning. I mean all games are kind of like that
02:58:04 But most games try to make you not fail the first time because it's frustrating to die
02:58:09 but in roguelikes you can really roll with the punches and so I died to the
02:58:16 Sniper bots like five times before I finally drilled it into my head to not be close to them when I killed them and that entire
02:58:22 Process felt totally satisfying. It didn't feel like oh when the heck am I gonna get the hang of this?
02:58:27 So yeah, that's something because yeah, I like I really like what the heck I went into the purple portal
02:58:32 But it but I went through the green portal. What the heck happened? Yeah
02:58:35 Well, you can't open the green portal because of Lambert will think oh well
02:58:39 He obviously wanted to go inside the crowd but he just couldn't do that. Oh rusty revolver. What does the rusty revolver do?
02:58:47 Oh
02:58:48 Okay, let me explain that entire chest right there that chest if you put a gun inside that chest
02:58:54 Then in an entirely different run with a different character
02:58:58 You can go to that chest and the same weapon will be in there
02:59:01 So that's it's permanently in there even if I turn off the game and stuff. Yes
02:59:05 That is a cool, but freaking tool brood pub the blue thing but unfortunately
02:59:10 I love my autocross bow a bit too much. Whoops. Oh, okay. I'm fighting these green guys
02:59:15 Oh fighting these green guys from the lab. All right fighting green guys thankfully my
02:59:19 Yeah, big glowing guys. Yeah, wait, whoa, whoa, where are you?
02:59:25 I was I was in a crown room. Yeah crown ball, right? Oh
02:59:32 All right, which crown should I get now?
02:59:35 More drops when it full HP
02:59:39 Ultra I
02:59:42 Mean level 10
02:59:44 Level 10 what the heck is level 10? Oh, I'm at level 7 and I'm halfway through
02:59:49 Don't get destiny if you're close to ultra you most of the time want to do destiny
02:59:54 He's you can just fit like squeeze an extra mutation in there
02:59:59 But since you're not pickups fade fast are worth they
03:00:04 Pickups fade fast are worth more. Well, see most pickups. I do get pretty quickly
03:00:08 Remutation narrow future a lot more cursed things no ammo
03:00:12 You know what? I'm gonna go with nothing because I want to keep things predictable because you know
03:00:15 Yeah, I'll start shaking it up after I've beaten the game. How about that?
03:00:20 Yeah, the crowns. I don't really know what they were. Oh, I forgot. I'm fighting a little hunter
03:00:26 Good luck. Godspeed. Yeah, the crowns don't the crowns don't seem very good. Yeah, they really are
03:00:34 Didn't kill a little hunter. Dang it. I
03:00:37 Died to the hunter. There was even a health pack up there, but I knew that the amount of time
03:00:41 I would take to get oh, man, I might die by the time I get there
03:00:45 That's a that's like a special property that the the snow area has which I guess is probably present in later areas
03:00:51 But the snow area has a tendency to drop health packs way into the middle of danger
03:00:57 So you have to start really counting for your temptation
03:01:00 Well, yeah, because because everything because everything's blowing up in the middle of these giant crowds
03:01:05 So that's where people are done. I'm glad. You know what Deville? I'm glad we both managed to kill little hunter
03:01:12 in this
03:01:14 Thing any but I think I mean are you guys tired?
