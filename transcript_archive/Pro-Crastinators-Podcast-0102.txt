00:00:00 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, and let me just tell you today, if you thought
00:00:08 your grandfather dying was bad, if you thought your dog shooting himself was bad, you are
00:00:12 not prepared for this travesty of pure unbridled misery we have for you today on this Pro Crastinators
00:00:20 Podcast. We have a devilish person just sitting within our ranks right here. We'll get into
00:00:27 a moment here, but before we break out your bones, before we break out your back, and before
00:00:32 we break out your literal tomb that we have here for you today, let's go over the normal
00:00:36 people who you already know and you're so sick of hearing that you might as well unsubscribe
00:00:40 right fucking now. We have Nate, we have Nate, who cares? Toblerone! Yeah, you see that? Stuff
00:00:46 like that, stuff like that happens on the podcast. Your spine is the Toblerone. Okay, go on. We
00:00:52 have Ben. Minecraft. This is what you're getting into. This is today's episode, a hit bone. Yes,
00:00:59 it's me. We have Tom. Insert meme here. We have Mage. MC Mage, new channel. MC Mage. We have
00:01:12 fucking legendary YouTube and my personal hero. How the fuck did we get this guy? Fit MC! How do
00:01:19 you do, fellow kids? Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah! All of the fellow kids have MC in their username.
00:01:28 Oh, okay, okay, okay. Let's get into backstory for this guy because this guy is fucking important.
00:01:32 He's crucial to understanding this entire topic. MC is a fucking dope ass YouTube like
00:01:39 Minecrafter who I found myself and I was a fan of for like a year and a half and it was great and
00:01:46 it was fantastic and I can't like just by one day by chance he commented on a piece of the episode
00:01:52 and I blew my fucking mind and I had to like refresh the page like two times make sure I wasn't
00:01:56 fucking dreaming. Here he is. Would you like to describe what you do, Fit? I'm a mind man,
00:02:02 you see. I'm a block boy, as they say. For the past year and a half, I've been convincing people
00:02:11 that I'm actually a YouTuber but I'm not. I'm just a guy that holocausts children on a Minecraft
00:02:19 server. That's all I have. Hey, Fit, can I just, I'm just gonna address the elephant in the room,
00:02:29 just rip this band-aid right off. What are your feelings about mining at night? Oh, thank you.
00:02:34 There's gonna be some divisions right off the bat. Yeah. Your words will scorch the earth.
00:02:43 I mean, I love Minecraft but the community is just something you tolerate, you know.
00:02:50 Oh, that's true. That's true. You know, when you live by anarchy, you can't combat at all. You
00:02:57 can't possibly hope to combat at all. Now, as I'm sure you realized, I'm sure you realized your
00:03:02 viewer, today's episode is indeed Minecraft. And of course, what is Minecraft? No one knows. We have
00:03:08 to consult the only good book that there feasibly is UrbanDiction.com. And let me tell you, I read
00:03:15 a few of these before the show to get myself immersed. Let me tell you that this is like
00:03:21 rivaling on NICE. These are the worst definitions we have to work with. So I'm just gonna read a
00:03:27 couple here. Minecraft, cheap and legal alternatives to drugs. This shit will sap your life away.
00:03:34 Minecraft, a kick-ass game that is being built slowly. The creator is notch and he programs the
00:03:39 game. Not anymore, bitch. I specifically like the words here. Person one, hey. Person two,
00:03:48 shut the fuck up. I'm playing Minecraft. There's like five different ones about it being a drug.
00:03:56 You get the point. It's a fucking video game. I went to knowyourmeme.com and that has a vastly
00:04:05 superior definition. It's just Minecraft is an indie Java video game created by Marcus Persson.
00:04:11 It is a sandbox mining slash building game which the players gather, blah, blah, blah,
00:04:15 various resources combine them, blah, blah, blah, developed a lot of online following, blah,
00:04:19 blah, blah, YouTube videos, blah, blah, blah. It was released during Minecraft, 2000.
00:04:22 Mate, shut the fuck up. I'm playing Minecraft.
00:04:26 A video game. The video game. We need to lay down some fucking groundwork here. We need to lay
00:04:30 down what the fuck is going on. We need to have some frame of reference going on and there's no
00:04:35 better frame of reference than how much of a new fag are you. What update did you guys join on?
00:04:41 Oh, Jesus. If I'm not mistaken, you literally first played Minecraft on a stream, right?
00:04:48 If you go into... Yeah, what channel can they find that video on? Where do those exist now?
00:04:53 Given Gaming, somewhere. One of the Minecraft streams there, Nate, tries to play Minecraft
00:05:00 and he learns about Redstone and he's really excited about various very mundane things and I
00:05:05 laugh at him. That's right. That was like a year ago or something. Yeah, fucking incredible. I have no
00:05:11 idea what that was. That was easily... That was a 1.10 or... Something like that.
00:05:18 It was pretty hilarious because I am a noob. I'm a Minecraft weakling and even I was rolling my
00:05:26 eyes at the things Nate found to be like, huh, it's really interesting how mine can do this and
00:05:30 I'm like, where have you been? It's 2017. When I learned that you could put obsidian in a block
00:05:35 and spark it with a flame and turn it into a portal, it literally devastated my soul on a
00:05:40 deep, fundamental level. I remember the specific update I joined on. It was beta 1.6 when they
00:05:51 added dogs and I played exclusively within a browser. I played only Minecraft in a browser,
00:05:59 which is extremely rampant at the time. You could just upload the files of Minecraft.
00:06:03 Wait, wait, wait, wait. A browser on your computer? Yeah, yeah. Well, hang on, I don't understand.
00:06:08 How did you do that? This is an exclusively 3DS game, as I understand it, and I was going to say
00:06:12 how impressive it was that all this stuff on 2B2T was built on a 3DS. That's really, you know,
00:06:19 that's impressive. That's impressive stuff. I think you're thinking of the mobile hit smash
00:06:25 game, Jurassic Park Alive, where you can go and run across your own GTS world and capture dinosaurs.
00:06:31 That's fine. Yeah, and I remember, I remember, I remember my first moments playing Minecraft
00:06:37 very vividly because it was like a nightmare. It was like a real-life nightmare where I joined
00:06:43 and then it turned night time and then just a skeleton appeared in my peripheral and I had no
00:06:48 idea there were monsters or that like night time was a feature. I was just walking around just
00:06:51 hanging out and then there were very, it was terrifying. It was fucking terrifying and I'll
00:06:56 never, I'll never forgive you, Notch. I'll never fucking forgive you.
00:07:02 I, I think I started playing Minecraft in a browser as well. I think I was in college or
00:07:08 something and I just like fucked around with it and I made no headway and I found it frustrating
00:07:12 and opaque, so I gave up really quick. And then like ever, like once or twice, like a friend of
00:07:18 mine would be like, hey, I play Minecraft, join my server, and then I would jump in for a little
00:07:22 bit, fuck around for like a day, and then give up and I'll play it again for like two years.
00:07:28 I played on, I played on Hippo's server for a little while, a while back, before I think the
00:07:32 server is dead now, but I made, I was very proud of myself. I made a little hut. I just like built
00:07:36 a little stone hut right next to Hippo's aquatic base and I hope it's still there. Sometimes I
00:07:43 think about it like, man, I hope that that little hut didn't get destroyed and taken apart for its
00:07:47 pieces. But I remember the one time that I almost was in danger of getting into Minecraft legit,
00:07:54 it was during the pony day. The extreme perilous danger that is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The sort
00:07:59 of Damocles was almost whatever. It was during the pony days when we were, it was in the, it was in
00:08:05 the heyday of the torrent of quality content that was t-bat plays. Oh no! I spent, no listen,
00:08:14 okay, because, because that was around the time that I had just gotten into a Shadow of Israfel
00:08:21 in the Yogscast and I had watched all of Shadow of Israfel and thought that it was the coolest
00:08:25 thing ever. Was it going to be those embarrassing podcasts we put up early?
00:08:30 Wait, shut up. So I, I spent like weeks, I spent like weeks trying to figure out a way
00:08:39 to get a modded version of Minecraft where we could be ponies, we could be phantom horn and keg
00:08:45 standard, and I thought that we could do like a, like a, like a Shadow of Israfel kind of thing.
00:08:53 I'm having, I'm having the flash, I'm having the key, so I'm slaying for views.
00:09:00 If I tried to Google and like there were some like pony mods of Minecraft, but they sucked
00:09:05 and like they didn't, I don't know, and I couldn't figure out how to make it work.
00:09:15 Do you remember? Oh yeah, it was the summer of 2010. I was just your typical college broham
00:09:20 and I was browsing V on 4chan and that's back when Notch himself was actually advertising on V.
00:09:27 I remember those days. Yeah, so he was posting some threads, so I decided to check the game out
00:09:31 and like I thought it was pretty sweet. I'd never played anything like it before.
00:09:36 I thought it was awesome. And then here I am, eight years later, God, literally the most powerful
00:09:44 Minecraft player of all time. Making that sweet bank.
00:09:50 Yeah. Holy shit. Oh my God, the return investment on that must be fucking insane.
00:09:55 It's because you're paying for a beta and stuff, you know, so yeah.
00:09:57 How much does Minecraft cost nowadays? $26.95. I just bought it. I think I paid $20 for it.
00:10:04 Yeah. Why is the price going up as opposed to down? I mean like, you know, I guess with the
00:10:09 update. Well, I think it's probably because when Microsoft bought it, they're like, hey guys,
00:10:13 let's jack this price up a little bit. I guess so. Well, whatever, whatever.
00:10:16 Also inflation question mark? Let's not open that. Let's not bring your fetishes into the
00:10:24 equation right now. Mage, when did you get into Minecraft? Oh gosh, when was Minecraft created
00:10:32 exactly? Like 2008, 2008? It went real in 2011. Because like, I think that's around the time I
00:10:39 got into it, 10 maybe, 2010, maybe nine, I'm not sure, because I remember a friend got it for me
00:10:46 because there was no way for me to buy it at that point. I was still living in no Athenian, no credit
00:10:50 cards, whatever. And yeah, he got it for me. It was like $17 ish at that time. And yeah,
00:10:57 and that's how I got into it. I remember I was the only one who could figure out how to host a
00:11:02 gosh darn Minecraft server with, what's that program? I hate that program. What's it called?
00:11:08 Windows Movie Maker. No, no, it was like...
00:11:12 Mine's over.
00:11:13 Hamachi, there we go.
00:11:14 I host my Minecraft server on my TI-83 calculator.
00:11:18 Yes. Got to launch that Mirage OS first.
00:11:20 Guys, no, no, no, no, guys, do you know Hamachi?
00:11:23 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I try to set that up. Little did I do, it was way more complicated than just
00:11:29 doing it normally.
00:11:31 Back then, yeah, Hamachi was like the only way you could really do it, and it was awful,
00:11:36 and I was the only one who could figure it out.
00:11:38 I tried fucking with Hamachi to post brutal doom with some of my friends, like to play
00:11:43 cooperative online, and that was hell on earth, and I hate it.
00:11:46 I'm never touching how much you can get no more.
00:11:47 Well, well, Mirage, that's interesting to know when you got into Minecraft,
00:11:50 but when did you then upgrade your life from Minecraft into one of the many shittier version
00:11:55 clones that you love so dearly?
00:11:56 Yeah, that's shitty, oh my gosh.
00:12:00 I think I've played one with you. It was almost like a weird hybrid, like,
00:12:05 terraria Minecraft weird fantasy fucking...
00:12:09 Wait, pets.
00:12:09 Oh, yeah, like pets.
00:12:11 It was just the pets.
00:12:12 And Mirage, aren't you also big into paladins?
00:12:14 You were the one telling me I was trying to get into paladins.
00:12:15 Oh my god!
00:12:16 No, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't like paladins anymore.
00:12:19 They changed the name.
00:12:19 Mirage, are you the one into angry birds?
00:12:21 Always talking about angry birds this and angry birds that.
00:12:24 I'm frankly sick of hearing about it.
00:12:25 Are you the person who's always trying to advertise Jurassic Park alive or all my friends?
00:12:30 That's a classic. A classic is a classic, my dude.
00:12:32 You guys need to stop.
00:12:34 Mirage, tell us about some of the many fine Minecraft alternatives out there.
00:12:42 Creative versus good.
00:12:43 I mean, like, vanilla, like in comparison to vanilla Minecraft, I much prefer great
00:12:48 gradeverse. It's a lot prettier looking, at least for me.
00:12:52 I like the building aspect. I like the pets I can have.
00:12:55 Like, every single creature can be turned into a pet and I love that.
00:12:58 It's a favorite thing to do.
00:13:00 And I honestly don't know how to sell the game.
00:13:03 Just like, check it out. It's free. There we go.
00:13:04 That's the best seller.
00:13:05 That's a good one.
00:13:06 It's Minecraft, but free.
00:13:08 That's pretty good.
00:13:08 That's pretty good.
00:13:08 That's pretty good.
00:13:09 Minecraft, but does everything Minecraft can do, but better than for free.
00:13:12 But better than for free.
00:13:14 Yeah.
00:13:14 And it can host servers so easily, you just make a world and like you host it and there you go.
00:13:20 It's up forever and everyone can join.
00:13:22 Do you offline or online?
00:13:24 You don't have to host it yourself.
00:13:25 I mean, you can host the servers really easily, but you know, there's no one to play with.
00:13:34 You can play it.
00:13:35 Hello.
00:13:36 All right. Who else we got?
00:13:37 Tom.
00:13:38 Tom, what did you first play the game?
00:13:39 Yeah. Oh God.
00:13:41 So I first played Minecraft in 2014.
00:13:45 And I was playing...
00:13:46 All these fucking new fags. Jesus Christ.
00:13:49 I started in 10, so...
00:13:51 So I, my friends were like,
00:13:55 yo, we're going to play Minecraft.
00:13:56 Do you want to play with us?
00:13:57 And I'm like, I've never played Minecraft in my life.
00:14:01 And they're like, well, you need to fix that immediately.
00:14:03 And I was like, uh, fuck.
00:14:05 So they made me buy Minecraft for $20 when it was 20 bucks, which sucked.
00:14:09 We made you a fucking knife point.
00:14:11 Yeah, they're like, dude, you're being...
00:14:13 But we're going to stream, we're going to play weekly.
00:14:15 It's going to be a thing.
00:14:16 It's going to be awesome.
00:14:16 And you're going to be part of it.
00:14:17 Like, okay.
00:14:18 So I started playing Minecraft.
00:14:18 And those friends would go on to become the Yogscast.
00:14:21 If only, yes.
00:14:22 Exactly.
00:14:23 Oh, oh, they wanted to get you in.
00:14:25 Tom, you're like, no, I don't see a future in this.
00:14:27 I don't think it's going to go anywhere.
00:14:28 They're like, well, suit yourself, dude.
00:14:30 My business savvy continues to be impeccable.
00:14:34 So we were going to play, and I was very confused when I started playing the game,
00:14:38 because I'm like, why is everything so confusing?
00:14:40 Like, why does everything look so shit?
00:14:42 And they were just like, no, that's like...
00:14:44 They're like, that's like...
00:14:44 This is not even real life.
00:14:46 Like, what the hell?
00:14:47 What are these pixels?
00:14:47 They're like, no, like, no, dude, that's the aesthetic.
00:14:50 I'm like, but like, there's like these weird, just like,
00:14:52 everything's so patchy and weird.
00:14:53 I don't understand.
00:14:55 And we were playing for like two hours.
00:14:57 And I was just very confused.
00:14:59 We learned to find out later that there was like a glitch with my computer,
00:15:02 and like half the textures weren't displaying.
00:15:04 And that's why I was so utterly bamboozled.
00:15:06 That's why everything looked...
00:15:07 Because I knew it was supposed to look shit,
00:15:08 but I'm like, is it supposed to look this shit?
00:15:10 Like half the textures just weren't loading.
00:15:12 So they're just like, you just have to combine these two things.
00:15:14 And I'm just like, but they look the same.
00:15:15 And they're like, what are you, retarded?
00:15:17 I'm like, I guess.
00:15:19 So that was my one and only experience with Minecraft,
00:15:22 because I could never get it to work my computer.
00:15:24 And I haven't tried since.
00:15:25 And I guess I still have a license floating around somewhere,
00:15:27 but I don't even know how I would access it at this point.
00:15:29 What kind of computer do you have,
00:15:31 where you can't fucking run Minecraft?
00:15:34 Well, that's the thing.
00:15:35 The computer was a quad-core i7, a GeForce GTX,
00:15:39 like 650 at the time, like 16 gigs of RAM.
00:15:42 It should have crushed Minecraft,
00:15:44 but no, it was not meant to be.
00:15:47 How bizarre.
00:15:48 How mistake.
00:15:49 Hey, remember when we got into Terraria for a little while there?
00:15:53 Terraria is like Minecraft, but just better.
00:15:58 That's, there you go.
00:15:59 There you go.
00:15:59 Better than for 9.99.
00:16:03 I'll just say, let's just do the Terraria real quick.
00:16:05 Terraria is just 2D, and it's more fun to play.
00:16:08 At least it was the vanilla Terraria.
00:16:09 It's more of a game game.
00:16:11 That's what I'm trying to say.
00:16:12 That's what I'm trying to say.
00:16:13 It's more of a game, but that's fine.
00:16:14 Okay, whatever.
00:16:15 Let's get this right one later.
00:16:16 I don't like it.
00:16:17 Wait, do we hear about Gibbs Origins?
00:16:19 Yeah, I don't think so.
00:16:21 Oh, yeah.
00:16:22 I saw Minecraft over my little brother's shoulder.
00:16:26 He was playing the Alpha, and he was putting cobblestone blocks around,
00:16:29 and I was like, what's that?
00:16:30 And he said, it's Minecraft.
00:16:32 You should get it.
00:16:32 It's really fun.
00:16:33 You can build.
00:16:34 And I'm like, oh, okay, yeah.
00:16:36 Look, you know, brushing it off, because, you know,
00:16:37 my little brother is playing it.
00:16:39 Therefore, I must be gay, so I'm not going to get into this.
00:16:43 Then I continue to see it, and I'm like, you know what?
00:16:46 That looks pretty fun.
00:16:46 And I could hear the Minecraft music,
00:16:48 because that was from an era where people, you know,
00:16:51 they still just listened to the music in the game.
00:16:54 And I got it in the beta, and I played it forever,
00:16:59 and I love it.
00:17:01 And it's my favorite thing, and I still love it.
00:17:03 And my biggest, like, Minecraft YouTube thing
00:17:08 was always X's Adventures in Minecraft.
00:17:11 That really got me into, like, do you remember that?
00:17:15 Me too.
00:17:16 Me fucking too.
00:17:17 Dude, I remember X-Base.
00:17:19 I remember fucking X's Adventure.
00:17:21 I love fucking X's Adventure.
00:17:21 X's Adventures in Minecraft.
00:17:23 I had already been following him,
00:17:25 because he made, like, World of Warcraft,
00:17:26 like, how-to-tank videos, and I was like, I need to know that.
00:17:29 And I just liked the way he talked and his voice.
00:17:32 And then his Minecraft series started,
00:17:34 and I was like, you know, he was in there on the ground floor,
00:17:37 but he sort of didn't blow up because of Minecraft,
00:17:40 unfortunately.
00:17:41 But his, like, journey through exploring Minecraft
00:17:45 in the early days and figuring stuff out and building X-Base,
00:17:48 it was... it is my favorite.
00:17:51 Hey, I just want to...
00:17:52 Starting to interrupt, I just want to let you know,
00:17:54 I just paid for...
00:17:55 I've been stealing Minecraft for a very long time.
00:17:58 Before this stream, I decided I would finally buy it.
00:18:00 I have just logged in to 2B2T for the very first time,
00:18:04 and looking around at this gigantic hellscape,
00:18:06 and it is... I see Swastikas.
00:18:09 I see Rachel Slurs.
00:18:11 Should we transition?
00:18:12 Should fit give us the rundown of 2B2T?
00:18:15 Well, let's take a little...
00:18:18 I feel like we all...
00:18:20 We can all get into the nitty-gritty of what we like about Minecraft.
00:18:25 I think it's time to transition over to Minecraft Server,
00:18:27 because that's where I spent the bulk of my time.
00:18:28 It's time to transition to Minecraft.
00:18:30 We've been waiting for this for a while.
00:18:31 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:18:32 I think all of us can agree that Minecraft Servers
00:18:34 is where we spend most of our time.
00:18:35 I'm not going to play some fucking shitty ass single-player game.
00:18:38 I love the single-player of Minecraft.
00:18:40 There's a single-player game?
00:18:41 It is so fun.
00:18:43 What the fuck?
00:18:43 But multiplayer is obviously where we go,
00:18:46 and Servers are fucking great.
00:18:47 I spend most of my time.
00:18:47 And there's very one particular server
00:18:50 that my friend Mark showed me many moons ago
00:18:52 called 2Builders2Tools.org.
00:18:55 And that's why I found this boy here, Finn MC.
00:18:58 Finn MC, I think you are like a professor.
00:19:00 You have like a PhD in this server.
00:19:02 So please, please explain it to us in the way that you do.
00:19:07 Okay.
00:19:08 Well, if there's any listeners that are not too familiar with Minecraft,
00:19:13 basically 90% of players, if you play through single-player,
00:19:16 you're going to have the same kind of experience.
00:19:18 You're going to build a base, make some food for yourself,
00:19:21 and then eventually kill the dragon.
00:19:23 Well, he has 90% of single-player for most people.
00:19:25 But when you get to multiplayer servers, there's a no pun intended.
00:19:31 There's a huge spectrum of different multiplayer servers
00:19:36 you can play on.
00:19:37 On the one hand, you've got like the kid-friendly mini-game servers
00:19:42 where you're like playing with your friends
00:19:44 and talking about it the next day at school.
00:19:46 And then you've got my side, all right.
00:19:50 Yeah.
00:19:51 Yeah.
00:19:52 The side that is actually really-
00:19:54 The heavier side of the spectrum, if you will.
00:19:57 So for those of you that don't know,
00:19:59 2Builders2Tools or 2B2T.org is the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft.
00:20:05 And I believe the second oldest server overall.
00:20:10 And it's-
00:20:10 Holy shit.
00:20:11 It's a server that has no rules, which means you can hack,
00:20:16 you can cheat, you can steal.
00:20:18 There's no censorship.
00:20:19 There's no admins at all.
00:20:21 It's just survival Minecraft.
00:20:24 But the map is like almost eight years old at this point.
00:20:28 And it is just insane.
00:20:30 Well, hey, I've got a question fit.
00:20:32 I mean, okay, so if that's the case, how did they make money off of it?
00:20:36 I mean, we got how someone's got to be-
00:20:38 If there's no profit motive, why would anyone ever be interested
00:20:41 in doing anything?
00:20:41 I don't understand.
00:20:43 Please explain.
00:20:44 Please explain.
00:20:44 Oh, yeah.
00:20:45 Well, for the first few years of the server, I mean, it was a very small server.
00:20:50 I'd say the most players that ever had, like as an active player base,
00:20:53 was about 100.
00:20:55 And the entire server ran off player donations.
00:20:58 The admin of 2B2T, his name is Housemaster.
00:21:02 He's this really mysterious guy that no one really knows much about,
00:21:06 except that he's from Sweden.
00:21:07 He never intervenes and it only will do it on the most extreme circumstances.
00:21:11 He's just this like bizarre shadow figure that like, I don't,
00:21:15 like how many people have ever even seen him, like in the world?
00:21:19 I have, I've seen a like a small leaked picture of him and that's about it.
00:21:25 Just a picture of the gray.
00:21:27 He's just like, he's like Bigfoot.
00:21:29 You know, I'm sorry to interrupt again, but I'm just,
00:21:31 I am currently exploring 2B2T for the first time here.
00:21:34 I've walked up to a skybridge and there was just a towering wall of lava
00:21:38 as far as the eye can see on either side.
00:21:41 That's just, it's impenetrable.
00:21:42 I have to go back.
00:21:43 I have to kill myself.
00:21:44 Fascinating.
00:21:45 You're going through the stereotypical first night on 2B2T.
00:21:49 You're a new player.
00:21:50 I guarantee you, just wait a couple minutes.
00:21:52 Someone will be by in Diamond Armor, running 100 miles an hour.
00:21:58 I can't wait to get demolished instantly.
00:22:00 I really look forward to it.
00:22:02 Oh, that sounds great.
00:22:03 Nate, I want, it needs to sink in for you.
00:22:05 You are not playing against like the best Minecraft server.
00:22:08 Like, you know, you don't, like, they have Diamond Armor fully enchanted.
00:22:12 That's not the problem here.
00:22:13 The problem is speed hacks and like one of the hills and like running across the map
00:22:19 at like insane speeds where you can't even fucking process them.
00:22:22 Oh, and when you go into the nether, like, like, like people will just be like
00:22:26 right up to you with fucking beds placed in the middle of your sleeping
00:22:28 and like just blowing you up instantaneously.
00:22:30 Well, listen, Munchie, I'm sure, I'm sure that's going to be really effective,
00:22:33 but I've got my own life hack right here.
00:22:36 No, the steak weed, bro.
00:22:38 I'm going to fucking blitz the fuck out.
00:22:39 Nobody can keep up with me.
00:22:41 Okay, that's, that's my joke.
00:22:42 I do weed.
00:22:43 The only way to like see speed hacks properly is to smoke weed.
00:22:47 That's slow down time.
00:22:49 That's right.
00:22:50 My viewers, I get this and I've explained 2B2T to many people before
00:22:54 and they've seen less than press than they should be.
00:22:56 So I just want to hammer this home for the normies in the audience.
00:23:00 You may be thinking, what's the deal?
00:23:02 Eight years?
00:23:02 That's fine.
00:23:03 I'm more than eight years old.
00:23:04 That's fine.
00:23:05 Okay, but you have to understand this.
00:23:07 Minecraft is a game where you can like, you can destroy and you can,
00:23:10 you can build anything.
00:23:11 You have complete like control to like tear form your reality.
00:23:16 And because it's no rules, you can tear form anything.
00:23:19 So just imagine the abuse that these four chain freaks and geeks have done
00:23:26 to not just the spawn area.
00:23:28 The spawn area's got the worst, obviously,
00:23:30 but just like for millions upon millions of block outwards from spawn,
00:23:35 the amount of griefing and like dynamite and just fucking unholy concoction
00:23:39 see people have made over the course of eight fucking years.
00:23:44 It's fucking unbelievable.
00:23:47 There are entire there.
00:23:49 My favorite thing about about fucking 2B2T is because it's obviously like a cruel wasteland
00:23:54 where you'll get fucking sodomized for asking for a nickel.
00:23:58 And that's just the way things are.
00:24:04 Oh God, I got to the top of staircase.
00:24:06 There was an intentional hole.
00:24:08 You know, dude, exactly, exactly.
00:24:10 But my favorite thing is like there are people dedicated to just helping out new fags.
00:24:17 And the two things that are the most evident of that are near spawn,
00:24:23 there are just like patches of watermelon you pick up because
00:24:25 watermelons are the new fag food.
00:24:28 And my favorite thing are the never highways.
00:24:31 There there are near the top of the ceiling of in the nether.
00:24:35 There are just like like two by two hallways that stretch out for like thousands upon
00:24:41 thousands of millions of blocks that stretch out farther than you could ever like hope to
00:24:48 walk in a single set, you know, session.
00:24:51 And they will help you get away from spawn as fast as you can.
00:24:54 And those are like maintained.
00:24:55 Like there are there are people who like intentionally like,
00:24:58 you know, try and keep up the appearance of those and try and fix them
00:25:00 when people try and destroy them.
00:25:01 It's great.
00:25:02 It's great.
00:25:02 It's a great community.
00:25:03 It's totally crazy.
00:25:05 Yeah, I mean, we even have it to the point where each cardinal direction,
00:25:08 if you're on the nether highway, it goes to the world border.
00:25:12 Millie.
00:25:12 Oh my god.
00:25:14 I haven't played in a while, but I remember they were working in that when I got this.
00:25:18 This is fascinating to me.
00:25:19 Like I'm not super interested in Minecraft as a game per se.
00:25:24 Maybe I just haven't tried it enough, you know, with like working graphics,
00:25:28 but like just the concept of there's a decade of just like culture and society and just like
00:25:34 like custom built around like like a virtual space and how it's just like slowly evolving
00:25:40 and the fact that like it's being done because it's different than something like World of
00:25:44 Warcraft where like, you know, people have been playing forever, but like that's like a static
00:25:47 world where like this is just like everything is entirely user generated and like susceptible
00:25:52 to be destroyed at a moment's notice.
00:25:53 And there's just like this undercurrent of just like some like underlying knowledge
00:25:56 that like the people who've been there forever just kind of understand.
00:25:59 It blows my mind.
00:26:00 It's so cool.
00:26:00 I just want to like listen to it forever.
00:26:02 When I first heard about it, it really, I haven't like looked into this either,
00:26:04 but like Eve online, as I understand it, has a completely organically generated like gigantic
00:26:09 factional system divided between like two huge organizations.
00:26:14 And that's just such a fascinating thing that that can exist in these virtual spaces
00:26:17 we've created and people like really give a shit about it and adhere to it and have
00:26:21 these kind of in groups that are completely separate from the real world.
00:26:26 They're only virtual dope, fucking dope.
00:26:29 Fit, I have a question.
00:26:30 How do you feel?
00:26:31 What are your thoughts on Dwarf Fortress?
00:26:33 Oh man, I have never actually played it, but I've seen it being played and I'm just like,
00:26:38 this game is not for me.
00:26:41 I can't, it's like fun losing, right?
00:26:43 That's the motto.
00:26:44 Like it's fun to lose.
00:26:44 Yeah, losing is fun.
00:26:45 Losing is fun.
00:26:47 I mean, I'm not great at Dwarf Fortress, but I've played, I've played some of it.
00:26:51 And all right, so since Munchy introduced me to your channel this past a little while ago,
00:26:57 I've listened to a bunch of your videos, especially like the ones that go into like,
00:27:01 you know, like the history and the lore of the server and stuff.
00:27:05 And listening to like, listening to like an account of like how like,
00:27:08 you know, the wars played out or, you know, how all these different like characters or people
00:27:13 had effects on the culture or whatever, it reminds me of something that I really like
00:27:17 about Dwarf Fortress, which I like even more than playing it.
00:27:20 Like, I really like listening to or like reading like, like stories of like,
00:27:26 how like a world played out and like how a Dwarven society fell.
00:27:31 Just like a procedurally generated like, story of like a world and stuff.
00:27:37 And like, the like a blow by blow of like how things, how things progressed in like a bizarre way.
00:27:43 Now, I don't, don't take this the wrong way, but bit to be to whatever the fuck this thing
00:27:50 his name is like, he fucking up is literally the Dark Souls of Minecraft.
00:27:56 Well, I'm sure that a lot of servers are like that.
00:27:58 But like, as I was watching your lore videos, I just kept thinking that this world is exactly
00:28:04 like what a Dark Souls setting is like.
00:28:06 It's like a ruined world where there are pockets of civilization that still exist,
00:28:10 and you can seek them out and find them.
00:28:12 And basically the fun of it is like exploring the lore and finding out what transpired here
00:28:16 to make the world into the twisted shell of itself that it is now.
00:28:20 And you're basically the Vati Vidya of B2BT.
00:28:24 Whatever the fuck it is.
00:28:27 What is the name of the server?
00:28:29 I don't know any of those.
00:28:30 Okay. Well, point is it's fucking awesome.
00:28:33 And it's super cool.
00:28:35 And it is Dark Souls.
00:28:36 And I like Dark Souls.
00:28:37 Please, I implore you all check out Fitzchannels.
00:28:40 He has a bunch of playlists.
00:28:41 He doesn't just do 2B2D, he does, you know, he does other stuff now.
00:28:45 But how I got into him, and I think a lot of people did, was 2B2D.
00:28:49 And they're fucking iconic videos.
00:28:51 I especially love, my absolute favorite is of course the Pop Bob video and the Valley of Wheat video.
00:29:00 I like the history of the super weapons.
00:29:03 That was definitely, my favorite by far of the ones I watched was the finally reaching the border wall.
00:29:10 That video legitimately brought me to tears.
00:29:13 Because it was so emotional and like seeing all these people, because like, okay guys,
00:29:18 just so you understand, it is over four million blocks or something.
00:29:21 It might have been four in the ether to get all the way into the final border of the server.
00:29:27 And to get there requires a month, months long real world investment of every day,
00:29:34 walking there with all the most biggest enhancements for speeds you can get.
00:29:38 And when you finally get there, and there's all these people waiting for you specifically fit
00:29:44 to have a celebration about you, this guy that they like love and respect.
00:29:48 All these people were willing to put in all this work to get all the way out there
00:29:51 in order to have a fucking party for you at this landmark event of you reaching the border wall.
00:29:57 That was like brotherhood.
00:29:59 It's fucking brotherhoods with that.
00:30:01 Nate, you know, that's gonna be every single day for Mexicans when they reach the border wall.
00:30:07 Brotherhood.
00:30:09 Walking across, you know, Vipitana, Patalinsa.
00:30:11 That's what they're gonna have every single day.
00:30:13 Incredible.
00:30:16 Just another great reason to build that wall.
00:30:18 Just another great one.
00:30:19 So that they could have that emotional fulfillment when they finally reach it.
00:30:23 We want to be able to let them nether orb hack past the border wall temporarily
00:30:27 and unlock their camera and see what's going on on the other side of that wall.
00:30:30 You know, why rob them of the joy?
00:30:32 We can't. We can't do it.
00:30:34 Yeah, so I mean, I think I'm the only one here besides Nate very recently who's actually played on 2P2T.
00:30:40 And I found out about it through a friend.
00:30:44 And we, like, here's how the 2P2T experience has gone for me.
00:30:48 Whereas, like, I'll join Spawn. I'll immediately be like, I'll have like whiplash.
00:30:54 Because this is unlike any other Minecraft server I've ever been in.
00:30:58 Like, you know, you'll have that pussy shit where like Spawn is like made out of Obsidian.
00:31:02 Like, hardcoded where you can't destroy Spawn.
00:31:04 This, you spawn in some like random fucking cobblestone tower, like 50 feet into the fucking sky.
00:31:12 With like lava surrounding all the sides.
00:31:14 And then, like, if you're lucky, like I was, your friend will show up
00:31:18 and it is fucking fully enchanted diamond armor, like on his horse.
00:31:21 And be like, hey, like, I've come to get you. We have to get out of here fast.
00:31:25 I've brought you watermelon. We have to run before they get us.
00:31:29 So, like, running through the night in this like fucking war-torn countryside,
00:31:35 you have to like search for the nearest Nether portal.
00:31:38 Like, hopefully your friend has brought Flint and like get it as fast as you can.
00:31:42 You have to vaid all these fucking bedbombing terrorists.
00:31:45 Like, like, like run a thousand miles in this fucking scorched hellhole.
00:31:50 And like hopping between Nether portals so you can like raid various bases on your way there so you can get supplies.
00:31:56 Because God knows, like, like he doesn't have the supplies, they can carry two people.
00:32:00 And finally you get you, finally you get to the base.
00:32:03 And his base, like, was like built at the top of this, like, like, how do I describe it?
00:32:07 Like, like, like a chunk loading wrong.
00:32:09 So it was just like ocean and then like very, like, like, hardly cut.
00:32:13 Just there was earth now, like, like, like low chud, uh, a chunk loading error.
00:32:17 And it was being like a giant, like, like Jerusalem, like, like cathedral type building.
00:32:22 It was fucking insane. It was absolutely fucking insane.
00:32:25 And, and oh my God, the feeling that you get, the feeling that you get when you fucking, when you see another player tag
00:32:34 and you can't tell who it is yet.
00:32:36 Oh, you don't know it's friend or foe.
00:32:38 Yeah, you just know someone's there.
00:32:40 And you instantly crouch, but it doesn't even matter because they all have like, like, tag, like trackers.
00:32:45 We can obviously tell where you are, but you just instantly crouch and you start to sweat in real life
00:32:49 and fear for your Minecraft possessions more than you've ever feared for your real life possessions.
00:32:54 Your entire fucking life.
00:32:57 This sounds fun. We should, we should definitely do like a procrastinator's like all go on the server at once and try to survive.
00:33:04 That's a slippery slope, Pipo. That's how you, that's how you get a new fag invasion.
00:33:09 That's how you get a, that's how you pollute and, you know, cancerize the society. That's a slippery slope.
00:33:16 Well, I guess there's an argument to be made that, uh, not to be mean or anything,
00:33:20 but I suppose you probably get a lot of detractors, you know, of the hardcore people, which I can sympathize with,
00:33:24 who aren't too fond of you popularizing, uh, fun, you know, like servers that they don't so much want the new fags to be exploring.
00:33:32 But, you know, you're a historian as I see it.
00:33:35 And so everything you've done is like a chronicling of the events here.
00:33:39 So, I mean, how do you deal with that?
00:33:41 What do you say to people who criticize it for that, if you even get that?
00:33:44 Well, it's, you know, it's totally understandable because 2B2T was born from 4chan culture,
00:33:50 which is very anti anything popular.
00:33:53 Yeah.
00:33:54 Secret clubs.
00:33:55 A lot of, yeah, it's like a secret club. So when a lot of players come on,
00:33:58 they try and act cool by saying like, oh, I hate YouTubers. I hate this, blah, blah.
00:34:02 But at the end of the day, whenever a YouTuber does invade, kind of like what's going on right now,
00:34:07 it's some of the most fun us old players have just by going to spawn and killing all these new players.
00:34:13 Makes sense.
00:34:14 Marsha was talking about bed bombing earlier, if you don't know.
00:34:18 So basically, in normal Minecraft, you fight with a sword and a shield and a bow.
00:34:25 On 2B2T, you fight with beds and end crystals.
00:34:30 Because since everyone is walking around in full protection for armor stacked,
00:34:37 and also they have what's called a totem of undying,
00:34:40 just like a fairy in a bottle from Zelda if you die and bring you back to life,
00:34:44 the only way to kill someone is to blow up a bed or a crystal next to them
00:34:50 and just deplete their totems until they are fully out.
00:34:54 It's just, I still have PTSD from the war of all these explosions going on around me.
00:35:00 And it's like whenever an eight year old comes up to me to start talking about Minecraft,
00:35:05 like I like pigs and stuff.
00:35:07 I just start thinking of my time in the trenches and all those explosions going on.
00:35:12 The bed bomb's going up left and right.
00:35:14 You haven't seen the shit that I've seen.
00:35:17 Have you been able to sleep in a bed after that?
00:35:21 He exclusively can sleep in race car beds because he has no negative associations with those.
00:35:27 Oh my god, there are so many times where I've seen someone race by in the nether
00:35:35 and I knew that my time was numbered and I had to reach fucking safety immediately.
00:35:43 Oh my god, because the nether highways are such tight corridors,
00:35:49 you'll just see an intersection up ahead but you can't properly see it.
00:35:56 So just imagine you're walking on this tight corridor, there's an intersection coming up.
00:36:00 You just see this guy with no diamond armor on, don't even fucking care about it, running at full speed.
00:36:06 You see his tracker come up and immediately disappear over the horizon.
00:36:10 And then you see him stop and look back at you and then you know you're going to start a great chase
00:36:17 unlike any fucking other.
00:36:19 Well hey listen, Minecraft's all fun and games, but it's time to get to the most important question here.
00:36:24 How exactly is Minecraft helping us make Starfleet real?
00:36:27 Like what are we doing here?
00:36:30 Nate, throw it in the garden.
00:36:33 You can fuck up.
00:36:35 I just want to model the Enterprise.
00:36:37 This is such a good episode.
00:36:39 Do you remember that one guy who built a one to one of the Starship Enterprise in Minecraft?
00:36:45 And then Inspector Gadget made fun of him on that mic.
00:36:50 Yeah, I remember that.
00:36:53 How fucking terrifying.
00:36:55 Fit, fit, fit. I want to know.
00:36:57 My first base was this watermelon castle thing I made.
00:37:01 What was your first base you made in 2B2D?
00:37:04 It was a dirt hut because I was surviving on zombie flesh and this was back in 2013.
00:37:09 And then I think I made like a little fishing hut next to a river and then I walked a hundred thousand blocks overworld
00:37:16 just to get established.
00:37:18 Why overworld?
00:37:20 Because you know when you're a noob and you're not familiar with like the nether and stuff
00:37:24 because when you're brand new you don't know about the nether highways,
00:37:27 you don't know where all the little secret shortcuts are that let you get in and out.
00:37:31 So you get that from just years of experience and sort of like mentally mapping out where things are on the server.
00:37:39 Is there like a, if one Minecraft block is one meter, how big is this server?
00:37:50 Like in terms of like real worlds.
00:37:52 Oh, okay. So, well first of all, to give you a real idea of how big this server is
00:37:58 I want to talk about how much disk space it takes up.
00:38:01 Most of the Minecraft worlds, if you plan it for a long time, it's probably going to be measured in gigabytes
00:38:06 like my original Minecraft world that I still have that I plan on is about four gigabytes.
00:38:11 2B2T is measured in terabytes.
00:38:14 It has been played on by I think 200,000 players at least once
00:38:21 and it's just, like I said, the highways go all the way to the world border in the nether.
00:38:28 Some players have walked millions of blocks overworld and it's just all this terrain has been generated
00:38:35 and what you can do is because it's such an old server, whenever Minecraft updates to add like new biomes and stuff
00:38:43 there's these violent chunk borders.
00:38:45 When you go from one Minecraft version to another and then following these chunk borders,
00:38:51 you can walk out hundreds of thousands of blocks to find people's bases.
00:38:56 It's crazy.
00:38:57 Yeah, damn.
00:38:58 It's not like those like 30 million blocks or whatever are like uninhabited.
00:39:03 After you get to a certain point, like, oh, there's just no civilization out there.
00:39:06 Like the top tier players, I'm forgetting, there was a giant city with a bunch of pro top tier players.
00:39:14 I'm forgetting if I can was that Jared found legendarily.
00:39:17 Oh, MC, yeah.
00:39:18 Yeah, MC, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:39:21 That was like millions of blocks out.
00:39:24 No matter where you go on the server, there will be someone who has tread before you
00:39:29 and that just makes it even more interesting because you can always find just little relics of like someone being there
00:39:34 or like a block misplaced or something.
00:39:37 Oh, this is the scariest 2B2.
00:39:39 Oh, actually, did you want to answer?
00:39:41 Do you know off the top of your head how big it is in real life, 2B2T?
00:39:45 Well, assuming, well, Minecraft world, I think isn't it at its biggest?
00:39:50 It's like 60 million by 60 million blocks.
00:39:53 I think so.
00:39:54 I think so.
00:39:55 Yeah, so just honestly, 60 million by 60 million is what it is because there are players that have generated those chunks all the way out to the world border.
00:40:03 Hypothetically, yeah, so.
00:40:06 I don't know.
00:40:07 It's fucking crazy.
00:40:08 It's nuts, man.
00:40:09 But the scariest moment that I had in 2B2T was I had not played for a while.
00:40:14 You know, I just like left, you know, my base there, you know, I had not played for like a month or two.
00:40:19 Then I joined back.
00:40:21 I walk out, you know, I walk outside and there's a sign left by someone like, like, hello, it's me so and so, found this deserted base, just took what I could.
00:40:31 Nice, nice looking base here.
00:40:33 You know, I left on this date.
00:40:35 And like, I don't even know, like, like, like, imagine coming home to your house and like all of your furniture is just like slightly shifted.
00:40:42 And you know that someone's been there and they haven't done anything malicious.
00:40:46 You just know it's out of place.
00:40:48 That's what I felt.
00:40:49 This person, this person, like, invaded my Minecraft base, like, thanking it was deserted.
00:40:53 Like, they didn't blow it up or anything.
00:40:55 They just came in, they like, like, took some of my diamonds and shit, which was fine.
00:40:58 That's just, you know, the name of game.
00:41:00 But it was just so fucking terrifying knowing that, like, I could have been logged in and, like, he could have easily killed me, probably, because I'm shit.
00:41:07 Like, like, I nearly avoided death by, like, playing dead.
00:41:11 And, like, him thinking this was an abandoned base.
00:41:13 Well done, dude.
00:41:14 Like, like, yeah.
00:41:15 Hey, hey, I just did a quick calculation.
00:41:17 I looked online.
00:41:18 Apparently, a Minecraft block is one meter.
00:41:20 Is one meter is the cannon distance.
00:41:22 So 60 million meters is equal to 37,000 miles.
00:41:27 So I guess you could say that it's roughly, like, 37...
00:41:31 Fuck, let me do the fucking math here.
00:41:32 This times this, fucking times this.
00:41:35 It is one...
00:41:38 Wait, one billion...
00:41:39 Wait, fuck.
00:41:40 I gotta count the fucking places here.
00:41:42 Okay, one trillion.
00:41:43 Three hundred and eighty-nine billion.
00:41:45 Nine hundred and sixty-seven.
00:41:47 Seven hundred and seventy square feet.
00:41:50 Jesus fuck.
00:41:51 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:41:52 You said that it's, um...
00:41:53 How big is the Earth?
00:41:54 Well, the Earth...
00:41:55 I don't know.
00:41:56 The Earth surface area is almost two hundred million square miles.
00:41:59 Okay, well, this isn't me...
00:42:00 Wait, this isn't miles?
00:42:01 Fuck.
00:42:02 I don't fucking know.
00:42:04 Hold on, hold on.
00:42:05 It's really big, guys.
00:42:06 It's really, really big.
00:42:07 It's really, really big.
00:42:08 I'm figuring this out.
00:42:10 Everyone continue.
00:42:11 In like five minutes, I'll jump in with some factoids.
00:42:13 No one cares about it anymore.
00:42:15 Some mad facts.
00:42:16 Yo, let's talk about how else this game is literally Dark Souls.
00:42:19 Uh, how about, uh, how cool it is?
00:42:22 That's pretty Dark Souls, right?
00:42:24 Thank you, thank you.
00:42:25 That's my contribution.
00:42:26 Yeah, there you go.
00:42:27 Speaking of loading chunks, I remember, unlike, like a month...
00:42:32 I prefer blowing chunks, if you know what I'm saying.
00:42:36 Dab, dab, dab, go on.
00:42:40 But before I left, like a month or two, there was an Elytra hat going on where this guy
00:42:45 was like, like, staying in air with the Elytra perpetually.
00:42:48 And he was going so fast that he was constantly loading chunks.
00:42:52 And so the server would have, like, lag in order to accommodate him loading new chunks,
00:42:56 like, creating, like, generating new land.
00:42:58 And so the server was always on, like, one or two ticks, because there was just, like,
00:43:03 like, one or two guys just flying around at, like, like, like fucking, like, sonic speeds,
00:43:08 like, breaking the sound barrier and their fucking wings, creating new land to inhabit.
00:43:13 It was a fucking nightmare.
00:43:15 It was really incredible.
00:43:16 They're also, oh my god, lag.
00:43:18 Lag is so fucking integral to the history of 2B2T.
00:43:22 People alternatively, like, like, like, like, like, like, the newest and best lag machines
00:43:27 in order to crash the servers.
00:43:29 Yeah.
00:43:30 You made a pretty good lag machine.
00:43:32 Or were you showcasing, I remember there was a video where you were showing off a lag machine.
00:43:36 I think you were at Offtopia's base, maybe?
00:43:39 Yeah, yeah.
00:43:40 Yeah.
00:43:41 And what's crazy is when you come across, like, the ruins of a lag machine, like, on 2B2T,
00:43:46 people consider that like an actual relic, like, whoa, this used to crash the server,
00:43:50 and now it's in ruins, and it's got vines growing on it.
00:43:53 Like, it's just this weird pseudo, like, lore thing going on.
00:43:57 I don't know.
00:43:58 It's just, it's so hard to describe 2B2T to fucking normies.
00:44:02 It's just.
00:44:03 Yeah.
00:44:04 Yeah.
00:44:05 The surface area of the Earth is 196 million square miles.
00:44:10 The surface area of this Minecraft server is 138 million square miles.
00:44:16 So it is smaller than the Earth, but not by that much.
00:44:19 Okay, all right.
00:44:20 It's like 70% of the Earth.
00:44:21 Do you remember that, like, most of the Earth is covered in water, so?
00:44:24 Well, yeah, so it's probably been.
00:44:26 How much of it that?
00:44:28 Most of it.
00:44:29 Oh, okay.
00:44:30 Was Gabe gonna say?
00:44:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:44:33 It sounded to be really cute that there were vines growing on it,
00:44:36 because vines don't just grow on stuff.
00:44:38 Somebody has to place them there.
00:44:40 Somebody has to, like, put them there.
00:44:41 Oh, somebody was like, ooh, I want to make these look really rustic.
00:44:43 I want to really make the souping look rustic.
00:44:45 Yeah, that's very possible.
00:44:47 I think they do grow on the south, but now.
00:44:49 I could be wrong.
00:44:50 Do they?
00:44:51 They do spread to a degree, and if they're hanging,
00:44:54 like, they will drop all the way down to whatever block they eat.
00:44:57 So, like, at spawn, you've got vines at sky limit growing all the way down to bedrock.
00:45:02 Fuck.
00:45:03 It fit.
00:45:04 I think I said my favorite story,
00:45:06 because these really are, like, Bible-esque parables that you have
00:45:10 of, like, legendary figures.
00:45:12 Like, they're, like, larger than life.
00:45:14 My favorite is Jang and the Valley of Wheat.
00:45:16 That's just, like, that's, like, literally a Bible story
00:45:19 where, like, this guy meets another guy in the nether,
00:45:22 and they, like, found, like, a city together.
00:45:24 Damn.
00:45:25 Please go watch the Jang and the Valley of Wheat fucking story
00:45:29 on Fit's channel.
00:45:30 What is your favorite story from 2B2T Fit?
00:45:34 My favorite story.
00:45:35 Oh, man.
00:45:36 I don't know.
00:45:37 I know.
00:45:38 There's so many.
00:45:39 There's so many, and it's just, um...
00:45:42 I honestly can't give you an answer right now
00:45:44 because there's just so much, and I have to, like, think back
00:45:48 because I've just put out so much 2B content
00:45:50 and just been on the server for so many years.
00:45:52 I don't know.
00:45:53 How about just a good one that's on top of your head?
00:45:56 I've got to think.
00:45:57 What's the most, like, tragic story you can think of?
00:46:00 Oh.
00:46:01 That's a good one.
00:46:02 That's a tragic story on this fucking set.
00:46:04 I'm going to open the old player vault for this one.
00:46:07 There was a player that joined 2B2T a long time ago,
00:46:11 and this player name was, it was Chris Leighton,
00:46:15 and he kept going around the server telling people,
00:46:18 I'm the king of 2B2T.
00:46:20 You mad?
00:46:21 And he would just scam it.
00:46:23 Yeah.
00:46:26 Well, turns out Chris Leighton used his real name
00:46:32 as his Minecraft username,
00:46:35 and so he was got so hard that he never returned to 2B2T.
00:46:41 And it's just, that's the thing about 2B2T,
00:46:44 it is a very toxic place.
00:46:46 I mean, people have, like, fucked with each other in real life
00:46:50 over a block game.
00:46:51 Like, it gets intense.
00:46:52 It gets intense.
00:46:53 If you join and you have, like, any sort of trace
00:46:57 to your real world identity, you're fucked.
00:47:01 Damn.
00:47:02 I guess they really were mad, after all.
00:47:10 Oh, god.
00:47:11 Oh, oh, this isn't on your channel fit,
00:47:14 but my favorite piece of, like, overall content
00:47:20 that you have produced was a dramatic reading you did
00:47:24 of a conversation between Pop Bob and Jared 2013.
00:47:28 Oh, yeah.
00:47:29 Where they just insulted each other back and forth.
00:47:31 Yeah.
00:47:32 Oh, man.
00:47:33 So it's, yeah.
00:47:35 It's hard to, like, explain this to outsiders
00:47:37 who don't know these people,
00:47:38 but 2B2T before it got, like, quote unquote, internet famous,
00:47:42 was just home to degenerates.
00:47:44 Like, you either played on it
00:47:47 because you had a sick curiosity like I did,
00:47:49 or it became your life if you had no life.
00:47:52 And the way these players would talk to each other,
00:47:55 just saying the most vile, fucked up shit to each other
00:47:58 and doxing each other, it was just...
00:48:00 It's all like the PCP in that way.
00:48:01 Yeah, from the sidelines, it was very amusing.
00:48:05 It was very amusing.
00:48:06 It was great.
00:48:08 And, okay, okay.
00:48:09 It's the 4 Chain community for you.
00:48:11 So there's two people.
00:48:12 Pop Bob and Jared 2013.
00:48:14 Pop Bob was, like, this, like, like, impfenous,
00:48:17 like, like, like, the fucking Griefer.
00:48:20 Like, like, Pop Bob's name is still, like, fucking,
00:48:23 like, ring throughout the cosmos as the Griefer.
00:48:26 He had a lightning hack where he can, like, you know,
00:48:28 like, like, understand where you are when lightning struck.
00:48:31 It was fucking, it was insane.
00:48:33 And I'm gonna show a little bit of my naivete
00:48:38 from what I can understand.
00:48:40 I have not looked into this person as much,
00:48:42 Jared 2013.
00:48:43 What I can tell is just, like, a huge asshole meme-er.
00:48:47 Sounds about right.
00:48:49 Yeah.
00:48:50 Yeah, okay.
00:48:51 He's just a fucking meme who, like, he's just, like,
00:48:54 yeah, he's just a meme-er.
00:48:55 He did some important stuff, like, basically,
00:48:57 like, I don't think about him as, like, a real person.
00:48:59 He's just a huge meme, which is fine.
00:49:01 And great.
00:49:02 But yeah, him and Pop Bob had this, like,
00:49:05 legendary conversation.
00:49:07 One line says,
00:49:08 Go sniff paint, you brain-dead kike.
00:49:10 I really like that one.
00:49:14 It's just fucking great.
00:49:16 I mean, I could stay here reminiscing about
00:49:18 all these fucking great times forever.
00:49:20 Like, the problem with 2B2D is, it's just so fucking big.
00:49:24 You can't talk about it in any, like, you know, reasonable way.
00:49:27 Like, we have not scratched the surface.
00:49:30 We've talked about, like, maybe, like, six stories here.
00:49:33 Like, that's literally nothing.
00:49:35 That is literally nothing.
00:49:37 There are countless stories that you could make.
00:49:40 You could be 2B2 famous if you really tried to.
00:49:44 You have the autonomy to do anything in this fucking game.
00:49:47 And you could make a name for yourself if you really fucking did.
00:49:49 I mean, that's the amazing thing.
00:49:51 I just, right now, just because I wanted to have a little experience
00:49:54 of playing it, just bought Minecraft,
00:49:56 even though I'd been resisting that for fucking years,
00:49:58 and just jumped right into the server,
00:50:00 and bam, there I am.
00:50:01 It's real.
00:50:02 It's real.
00:50:03 The legends are all there.
00:50:04 I've done it.
00:50:05 Your contribution so far is probably, like, you know, like,
00:50:08 stepping on grass.
00:50:09 I ate shit and died is what I did.
00:50:12 Humble beginnings.
00:50:14 At the very least, Nate, you've added to that fucking terabyte,
00:50:18 you know, file size.
00:50:19 You are now a new player ID that the game has to keep track of.
00:50:21 There you go.
00:50:22 Your name is etched inside of there for fucking ever now.
00:50:24 What is it?
00:50:25 Memeboyblue will live on forever in those annals.
00:50:28 Memeboyblue.
00:50:29 Memeboyblue.
00:50:30 There he is.
00:50:31 That's what's cool about 2B2T.
00:50:33 What I like about all fucking multiplayer games is just the ability to,
00:50:37 like, with your friends, like I played 2B2T with,
00:50:41 with your friends to just be able to bond over doing some of the game.
00:50:45 Video games, multiplayer video games are literally like World War I,
00:50:50 aka good.
00:50:52 There is no greater way to bond with your fucking friends
00:51:00 than having a common goal that unites you against an adversary
00:51:03 in order to fucking defeat it.
00:51:05 That's just common odds.
00:51:06 That's what you fucking do.
00:51:08 Watchmen was literally based on 2B2T in that respect.
00:51:13 Watchmen was.
00:51:14 Yeah.
00:51:15 Yeah, because ultimately they hold the unite against a fake opponent
00:51:17 so that they wouldn't kill each other, you know?
00:51:19 Having an external opponent is what unites people.
00:51:21 It brings people together.
00:51:23 Yes, basically.
00:51:24 And that's why all of my best friendships have been forged
00:51:27 in fucking Minecraft or fucking, you know, TAF2, all that shit.
00:51:31 It just, it just, it's the perfect, honestly, God, believe this.
00:51:35 It's like the perfect way to spend time with your friends.
00:51:38 Like having, like, like, like an understandable, like, realized goal
00:51:43 and like being able to talk about whatever you want,
00:51:44 just like in this pointed, directed conversation.
00:51:47 It's fucking beautiful.
00:51:48 I love multiplayer games.
00:51:49 I literally, I, multiplayer games are better than skill player games.
00:51:53 That's a real thing that I actually think.
00:51:54 These can be with your fucking real ass friends and doing share.
00:51:57 I, the moments I have playing fucking Terraria or TF2 or fucking, you know, CSGO for a while,
00:52:02 they're beautiful.
00:52:03 They will never be taken away from me.
00:52:05 I don't remember mining coal and mine.
00:52:07 I don't fucking care about that.
00:52:08 I care about, I care about finding old bases in 2B2T and destroying them completely.
00:52:13 That's kind of shit that I care about in games.
00:52:15 Yeah.
00:52:16 I don't know.
00:52:17 I want to know, like, like, who, who, Ben, you are, you are now officially 30 years old.
00:52:22 You are 30 years old.
00:52:23 Yes.
00:52:24 As of today.
00:52:25 Happy birthday, Ben.
00:52:26 Happy birthday.
00:52:27 Yes.
00:52:28 Splendid.
00:52:29 Do you have any memories playing online?
00:52:31 At all.
00:52:32 At all.
00:52:33 Or are they gone?
00:52:34 They're fading fast.
00:52:35 They're fading fast.
00:52:36 Yeah.
00:52:37 Wait, do I have any memories of what now?
00:52:39 Of, like, playing online is the difference because I get the impression that this is a fairly,
00:52:42 like, new person, you know, new age, Gen Z thing, to, like, want to spend time with your
00:52:47 friends in video games.
00:52:50 The multiplayer game I probably played the most of was Team Fortress 2 for a while.
00:52:56 Yeah.
00:52:57 Yeah.
00:52:58 But I didn't, I didn't play it with friends.
00:53:00 Like, I didn't have no anyone else that was playing it.
00:53:02 So I fell off.
00:53:03 I don't know.
00:53:04 Like, I had friends that tried to get me into Minecraft and I didn't stick to it.
00:53:07 I had friends one summer in college when I was home.
00:53:11 I, yeah, I played World of Warcraft for one summer because it was, like, just the way to
00:53:17 hang out with my friends.
00:53:19 So, and it was, and that was cool.
00:53:22 And then, so that was, like, like, playing through the game and, like, leveling up was
00:53:26 fun.
00:53:27 And then I got to the end and, like, I hit max level and it was, oh, time to start
00:53:30 raiding and I realized that I hate World of Warcraft and I stopped playing it.
00:53:33 But I didn't need it anymore because now...
00:53:35 You realize that you hate it once you beat it, yeah.
00:53:37 I mean, that was similar to my experience with League of Legends.
00:53:40 I just played it so I could stay in contact with my friends.
00:53:42 Yeah.
00:53:43 For the most part, yeah.
00:53:44 Yeah.
00:53:45 I played them, I played with friends, friends tried to get me into League of Legends as
00:53:50 well and I quickly realized that I just wanted none of it.
00:53:53 I remember very well.
00:53:54 You played Warwick and then you said, wait, there are other characters to learn besides
00:53:59 Warwick?
00:54:00 It's like, it's not enough for me to just kind of get good at using Warwick?
00:54:03 I have to, like, know them all?
00:54:05 Fuck this.
00:54:06 Understandable.
00:54:07 Understandable.
00:54:08 I played, I played a little bit of Halo 2.
00:54:09 That was my online game back in the day.
00:54:11 Me and my buddies would play Halo 2 because we played Halo 1 for a long time at my friend
00:54:15 Mike's house and we just played the same map, Hang'em High, Pistols Only.
00:54:19 It was the fucking best and then we moved to Halo 2 and we played that all the fucking
00:54:24 time and I hated that I had to keep buying Xbox Live because I'm cheap as fuck.
00:54:28 I couldn't understand.
00:54:29 I tried because I had like two groups of friends.
00:54:32 I had like my friends from like...
00:54:33 Where's the Xbox?
00:54:34 I had my buddies from the comic book store because I used to play like cards and shit
00:54:38 there all the time.
00:54:39 And we would play Halo and then my friends from like school would play Counter-Strike
00:54:45 and I hated Counter-Strike because it was hard and I don't like hard things because
00:54:49 it was...
00:54:50 My computer also sucked ass.
00:54:51 I had to run it like at the lowest setting.
00:54:53 So that was not fun.
00:54:54 So I played Halo all the time and I remember specifically my last time ever playing Halo
00:54:59 2 online because we were fucking garbage at Halo 2.
00:55:03 Like to this day, me and my buddy Mike, I just hung out with him yesterday.
00:55:06 We were terrible at games and despite the fact that we like to be good at games, no
00:55:11 matter how much effort and practice we put into it, we never get better.
00:55:15 And that started all the way back with Halo 2.
00:55:17 I remember the last day we both played Halo 2 was when we were just pubbing, being fucking
00:55:23 retarded, trying to get good, trying to maximize our rocket jumping and BXR and still couldn't
00:55:28 do it correctly.
00:55:29 And then we just joined this random match and these two little kids completely dominated
00:55:35 us and they just spoke Spanish the whole time it happened.
00:55:40 Yeah, it was munchy.
00:55:41 It was munchy.
00:55:42 Exactly.
00:55:43 And we had no idea it was going on.
00:55:44 And from that, we were so shamed forever.
00:55:45 We hung up our controllers for the rest of the time.
00:55:48 You know what?
00:55:49 It's good for a man to know when he's wasting his fucking time.
00:55:52 Yeah.
00:55:53 Tom, I want to let you know that I have PCSD when anyone even mentions the word Halo.
00:56:00 Like, the room fills with like a ball smell and all I can smell is balls because the only
00:56:05 person I ever played Halo with was my cousin who just always smelled like balls and whenever
00:56:12 he would kill me because he wouldn't teach me how to play would just say, ah, sick, you're
00:56:16 shit.
00:56:17 That was my only experience with it.
00:56:20 We learned a lot from it.
00:56:21 The word I would most associate with Halo is, this kid just screams Nate because my friend
00:56:28 Mike's brother, his Nate, because he would throw grenades, but yell Nate really obnoxiously.
00:56:33 Oh, Nate.
00:56:34 Lesson grenade.
00:56:35 Okay.
00:56:36 Okay.
00:56:37 It's supposed to be Nate, but he would say Nate because he's a fucking idiot and we named
00:56:41 him Windo because at one point he got so mad that we beat him and hang him high he punched
00:56:46 the window of the house and shattered it and ran outside.
00:56:49 Oh my fucking God.
00:56:50 Hell yeah, Windo.
00:56:51 That sounds like my fucking kind of guy.
00:56:54 He's a fucking monster guy.
00:56:56 Oh my God.
00:56:57 Oh my God.
00:56:58 The fucking dueling your friends in Team Fortress 2 is the most sadistic pleasure you can ever
00:57:06 derive from your fucking life.
00:57:08 It's worse than real life torture.
00:57:10 I have concluded.
00:57:11 There are many duels that I've done in one.
00:57:15 I have concluded that being your friend in Team Fortress 2 and them screaming at the top
00:57:21 of their lungs trying to fucking kill you is the worst thing you can possibly do to another
00:57:26 living being.
00:57:27 Like no matter the friend, no matter if your friend is short tempered or not, in Team Fortress
00:57:32 2 there's just something about it where they will just try so fucking hard to kill you
00:57:37 with all their might.
00:57:39 Like new friends, old friends, doesn't matter, all will fucking scream at you in Team Fortress
00:57:44 2 duels.
00:57:45 It's not really a similar experience to this fit.
00:57:47 TF2 is just nuts.
00:57:49 I mean, I am not one that is quick to violence, but when you hear that domination jingle
00:57:56 and then someone congas over your dead body, it's really hard to just stay calm.
00:58:04 You know, I've never been able to do that.
00:58:07 I always rage-quit every FPS, every single one.
00:58:12 My friends, I forget what game we were playing.
00:58:14 It was some game along these lines.
00:58:16 And so like the match was over and like one of my friends won and one of my friends lost.
00:58:21 And like the one who, like, so everything was like perfectly calm, like uncomfortably
00:58:26 calm after this like victory of one and the loss of the other.
00:58:29 And that just kind of went on for a minute or two until like a discussion began about
00:58:34 whether or not it was more cold-blooded to be like an up close and personal like soldier
00:58:39 who has to kill soldiers like Kloestrum or if it's more cold-blooded to be a sniper.
00:58:44 And this discussion-
00:58:45 What's more cold-blooded?
00:58:46 What's more cold-blooded?
00:58:48 This discussion has gone down the annals of my friendship history as one of the most climactic
00:58:52 and earth-shattering moments of all time.
00:58:55 And you know-
00:58:56 I'm sure you must have concluded that snipers are pussies.
00:58:58 You must have concluded that, yes.
00:59:00 Well that they're like, well that they're like the more, okay, see one of the, the friend
00:59:03 who won kept saying like, nah dude, it's way more bass, like get up close and personal
00:59:08 and like fucking just shoot him right there.
00:59:09 But the other friend who had lost like slowly but began to emerge with this deep burning
00:59:14 rage, like it's obviously going to be the sniper because he has to like study him and
00:59:17 like learn about him and like know his family and friends and like intimate, like get intimate
00:59:21 with him.
00:59:22 So obviously he's the one who's more cold-blooded, you stupid motherfucker, it's obviously the
00:59:26 sniper.
00:59:27 If you're killing a million people, all your friends are dying, you're going to be, your
00:59:30 anxiety is going to be so high, you have to be the snipers, obviously the one who's
00:59:34 more fucking cold-blooded.
00:59:36 And then he like kicked the wall and like broke a lamp and ran away.
00:59:39 Not one, not one, not one, like which is cooler or more honorable, no, cold-blooded-
00:59:46 Yeah, it was cold-blooded.
00:59:47 He was more cold-blooded, that's right.
00:59:49 That's right.
00:59:50 These are serious questions, clearly.
00:59:52 Yeah, yeah.
00:59:53 But it all derives, the rage there obviously derived from the game.
00:59:56 I think it might have been legal legends or something, I can't remember.
01:00:00 I still, I said this before about how like I have met all of my like good friends over
01:00:05 like Cube Fortress 2 or Minecraft and I remember the first time that I met like a lifelong friend
01:00:12 that I still talk to to this day, I met him on an Australian furry server that I had just
01:00:18 like randomly joined and he and another person I know, yeah, randomly, they're both like
01:00:27 arguing about like the 2012 presidential election, like at the top of the lens, like
01:00:32 all of the furry add-ons were like telling them to stop, but they just wouldn't do anything
01:00:37 they made them angry.
01:00:40 And it was great, and that's why I met, there's just, it's beautiful, multiple video games
01:00:46 are just fucking beautiful, because all the things that you can do and all the things
01:00:49 that you can be, that's why you come to the Oasis, you know, that's what people say in
01:00:54 this Steven Spielberg hellhole, it's incredible.
01:00:57 In terms of like MMOs, I used to play a shit ton of MMOs, but like RPG MMOs are, MMORPG
01:01:04 is mostly fantasy ones, I would hop from one to another life within a month or so.
01:01:11 I played like, I probably played all of the old MMORPGs that are out there still, if you
01:01:18 have even closed, I think City of Heroes used to be a really good one, it's not a fantasy
01:01:23 one, it was a hero one that was like the best game ever, but they closed it, I'm so sad.
01:01:29 And another one was Shin Megami Tensei Imagine, which was based on the Shin Megami Tensei
01:01:34 series.
01:01:35 Oh, they made an MMO of that?
01:01:36 Is that official?
01:01:37 Yeah, yeah, it was, and like, they changed publishers at some point as well, and I didn't
01:01:42 even know about the Shin Megami Tensei series when I got into the game, everything was like
01:01:46 completely new to me, and it was like, it was amazing, I loved it, and then they closed
01:01:50 it as well, and I was like, sad.
01:01:53 What was that game, didn't like we all play some game with you one time, like we all got
01:01:59 in some MMO.
01:02:00 Whatever many MMO journeys, yeah.
01:02:02 Eatin' Eternal, I'm pretty sure that one was, it was really cute.
01:02:06 Eatin' Eternal, it was a eating simulator, just eatin' eternally, there you go, it's
01:02:10 an inflation, again, your inflation fetish comes raring again.
01:02:13 Stop this, no, do not, do not.
01:02:15 Try to flood this fucking server with inflation, I'm not gonna stand for it.
01:02:19 I know, I don't, stop, I don't have the courage to stop this abuse.
01:02:23 No meme.
01:02:25 No.
01:02:26 Well, hey.
01:02:28 Hey, should we use your questions or?
01:02:30 Hippo's good shit.
01:02:31 Okay.
01:02:32 That he's playing?
01:02:33 Yeah.
01:02:34 Oh, in terms of multiplayer, well, my multiplayer game experience was primarily when I was growing
01:02:42 up with just my brothers playing multiplayer PlayStation 2 games, two at a time.
01:02:48 Things like Worms 3D, which is the first three-dimensional Worms game where you're going around shooting
01:02:55 things and it's like really laggy and slow and terrible, but me and my brothers would
01:03:01 hang out in that and that would be like the way we hung out, kind of, instead of going
01:03:06 to the park and playing the B-ball or the football.
01:03:08 Yeah, fuck that shit.
01:03:09 It's all about the fucking Worms.
01:03:11 We got the Worms, we would build- Fuck basketball, Worms are good, fuck basketball, Worms are
01:03:17 good.
01:03:18 All right, enough of that, but we would spend hours in those like levels not killing each
01:03:25 other and instead using the girder tool to build fortresses, which we would then flood.
01:03:32 It never really became about the game, it was always just about, you know, fucking around.
01:03:38 We would invent this game called, I don't remember what it was called, but it was like
01:03:44 you have to kill yourself over and over and to try and minimize your score, like whoever
01:03:49 has the least points and it would go into minus points and we would just do that and
01:03:55 you can't win by getting minus points, so we just kept going forever.
01:03:59 With that- Yeah, sorry, go on, go on.
01:04:02 The reason I say that is that a lot of my like multiplayer experience was not with anyone
01:04:07 over the internet.
01:04:08 I never really liked talking to people in like RuneScape or World of Warcraft because,
01:04:14 you know, much against like the popular belief, people in RuneScape are actually retarded
01:04:21 and I don't like them.
01:04:23 Are they fucking super geniuses playing like the most advanced MMO?
01:04:26 No, they're actually very fucking stupid and I never liked anybody in RuneScape, I never
01:04:30 got along with anybody.
01:04:31 You need to buy a GF.
01:04:33 Yeah.
01:04:34 They are so expensive, I actually did go on a GF thing, but I didn't buy a GF, somebody
01:04:39 says, I'll be your GF and I was like, whoa, excuse me, for free, yes, and then we threw
01:04:45 snowballs at each other and she cried and ran away and I was like, I didn't know what
01:04:48 I- You didn't treat her right, man, you didn't treat her like a queen.
01:04:51 That was your problem.
01:04:52 I didn't use the right emotes, I don't think I had the right emotes.
01:04:55 Yeah, that was the problem.
01:04:57 Hey, uh, did you ever play the Ratchet and Clank 3 online multiplayer?
01:05:04 I would have, I didn't have- You needed that like extra box or whatever thing, yeah.
01:05:09 I think when Ben and I bought- Yeah, I didn't get the attachment, I played that with my
01:05:12 brothers as, again, it's like a multiplayer, I played with them and it was like even Minecraft,
01:05:19 like we would have our own server and we would like build our own individual towns and then
01:05:23 connect them with like mine cart, rails and create train stations, just the three of us.
01:05:28 Mine, comp, excellent.
01:05:29 And we would, yeah, very good.
01:05:35 And like when it comes to online stuff, like getting into like making friends and like
01:05:41 random people, meeting people, I've always shied away from it, I'm a very shy boy, I'm
01:05:45 a very like baby lad and I don't like talking to strangers on the internet, they may like
01:05:49 take me in their van and I don't like it.
01:05:53 It's only very recently that I've started to just, you know, well actually, I've never
01:05:57 done it in TF2 or Minecraft, making a friend, it's always been through something else like
01:06:03 fucking my YouTube channel or like associating with someone who is also a YouTuber, like
01:06:09 it's, I don't know, I have one person from World of Warcraft that I actually considered
01:06:15 a real friend and I could probably still talk to them.
01:06:17 I can relate, like with all the MMOs I've played throughout my whole life, I never really
01:06:21 made friends, like I think one time, twice maybe, I joined some guilds and made friends
01:06:26 there, but when I cut the game, the friendships just kind of sizzled out and yeah, I never
01:06:33 really, I usually play solo on MMOs as sad as that sounds.
01:06:39 I do too, I like soloing like lower level raids from earlier expansions by myself because
01:06:47 getting a group together is a hassle and nobody is good.
01:06:50 I remember when I first started playing World of Warcraft, I didn't know what I was doing
01:06:54 at a deep social anxiety about like trying to like be good at the game because I just
01:06:58 didn't understand it.
01:06:59 I mean, I played for like two weeks or something, but still, yes, deep fears, deep fears.
01:07:04 Oh, coming back to Minecraft, the only multiplayer server I've ever played on Minecraft was Pixelmon,
01:07:10 which was a Pokemon.
01:07:12 I trusted that I really wanted to do that, but I couldn't get to work.
01:07:16 It worked for me and it was like, I had a blast, it was really fun, it was like playing
01:07:20 Pokemon in Minecraft.
01:07:21 You could build stuff and catch Pokemon and you can like live outside and be surrounded
01:07:25 by like Shutenabu Saber Lies and that was perfect.
01:07:28 I loved it.
01:07:29 Damn.
01:07:30 Nice.
01:07:31 I remember when Minecraft was fun.
01:07:32 Sadly, Pixelmon got shut down because Pokemon people shut it down.
01:07:41 So all the good things in my life has been shut down, so.
01:07:45 Only your life remains.
01:07:46 It was the kids of death for all these things.
01:07:48 It's made shows up.
01:07:49 It's days and numbers.
01:07:50 So 2BPT going to get shut down soon.
01:07:52 I keep saying that you're like a second person that says that to me this week that like whatever
01:07:57 I touch is dead.
01:07:58 He's dead.
01:07:59 Can't wait for the PCP to get permanently demonetized.
01:08:01 Whatever Mage touches turns purple.
01:08:04 Yes.
01:08:05 Oh, God.
01:08:06 There's only one thing more I want to say on the subject of stories of multiplayer games.
01:08:11 Before we move on to questions here.
01:08:13 My earliest multiplayer game memory that I have is Ethan.
01:08:20 We all know Ethan.
01:08:21 We all know he's the legendary person of Best Boy here.
01:08:25 Pukiboy himself.
01:08:26 Yeah.
01:08:27 Before I knew what he looked like before I heard him, I was playing Minecraft with him
01:08:33 and he was like, hey, we should join a tiny chat and then we should like we should like
01:08:37 see what each other sounds like.
01:08:39 So I turn on my mic in this fucking tiny chat, which if you know tiny chat, fucking
01:08:43 press one for tiny chat.
01:08:49 And I was like, hello.
01:08:50 And he was like, ha, your voice sounds gay.
01:08:52 And then he turned on his voice and his voice was even higher.
01:08:57 And that was the beginning of our fucking friendship.
01:08:59 What was building Minecraft gay bath houses and you know, all the associated war.
01:09:04 It was fantastic.
01:09:05 And that's why I met fucking editor of the spicy row pack was through fucking Minecraft
01:09:09 and my best boy.
01:09:11 I love him with all shout out.
01:09:12 Yeah.
01:09:13 So fucking multiplayer games.
01:09:15 Good shit.
01:09:16 That's that's how I made most of my fucking friends.
01:09:18 What is the PCP but a real online multiplayer game?
01:09:23 Yeah.
01:09:24 Where are you going?
01:09:25 PCP MMO.
01:09:26 That's the real question here.
01:09:27 The fucking currency that you can buy stuff with will be the PCP and will be a real cryptocurrency.
01:09:31 It's going to start with the rowdy fuckers.
01:09:33 Once I fucking gamify the rowdy fuckers cop killers, that will be the beginning.
01:09:38 Yeah.
01:09:40 Day by day, you'll gamify it more and more until it is just a real video game.
01:09:44 That's the plan.
01:09:45 That is actually the plan.
01:09:48 It's just going to have so much feature creep.
01:09:50 Like the creature, the features are just going to creep in.
01:09:53 So they're just they're never going to stop creeping in.
01:09:57 Just like creepers, you could say from there.
01:10:01 You might, you might say just like that song about creepers that's like click, click, boom.
01:10:08 I play Minecraft every day, but not at night.
01:10:10 I love that.
01:10:11 I certainly love the radio.
01:10:12 There you go.
01:10:13 That's it.
01:10:14 All right.
01:10:15 We're done.
01:10:16 Jesus Christ.
01:10:17 We get to the fucking questions now, please.
01:10:18 I'm dying here.
01:10:19 I'm dying.
01:10:20 I mean that we're floundering is what I'm saying here.
01:10:24 That's what I'm saying.
01:10:25 Can I tell you a secret?
01:10:26 Okay.
01:10:27 Can I tell you?
01:10:28 Can I tell you a secret guys?
01:10:29 Okay.
01:10:30 No.
01:10:31 I once had a Minecraft channel.
01:10:32 Oh, no way.
01:10:33 What?
01:10:34 Oh my God.
01:10:35 Yes.
01:10:36 Yes.
01:10:37 Is it called purpleminecraft.org?
01:10:38 No.
01:10:39 It is called Fiddim C.
01:10:41 No.
01:10:42 I wish.
01:10:43 No.
01:10:44 It was terrible.
01:10:45 I think it has like eight subscribers right now.
01:10:47 Is it still up?
01:10:48 It was like terrible audio.
01:10:49 Yeah.
01:10:50 It had like six videos and then I quit.
01:10:51 Well, you tell us a little bit.
01:10:52 Or do you want to be a fun game to see who can get it first?
01:10:56 I won't say the name now because I want to review the videos to see if I reveal any personal
01:11:01 information on them.
01:11:02 Okay.
01:11:03 By the time the video goes up, if it's okay content, maybe you'll be linked in the description
01:11:08 if I remember.
01:11:09 Yeah.
01:11:10 All right.
01:11:11 Cool.
01:11:12 The hunt begins.
01:11:13 Whenever someone brings up that they have like a Minecraft YouTube channel, I always
01:11:16 feel really bad because it's like there's been tens of thousands of Minecraft YouTube
01:11:21 channels that have tried to get their feet off the ground and failed.
01:11:24 And then you got me some mid-twenties fuckboy that just comes along and makes a couple videos
01:11:29 and it just blows up randomly.
01:11:31 Hey man.
01:11:32 Well, that's life.
01:11:33 You're in the right place at the right time, I guess.
01:11:36 The whole Minecraft YouTube genre is like full of people who just make one thing that
01:11:42 suddenly it becomes a new trend like that fucking, the realistic Minecraft with the green
01:11:48 screen hands that we were looking at the other day.
01:11:51 And you know, furthermore, there's a whole genre of Minecraft videos where a guy just
01:11:54 green screens his hands and he pulls a realistic Minecraft.
01:11:57 I mean, if you're putting yourself up against like every individual Minecraft channel out
01:12:01 there, like you're putting yourself up against people who's just videos just like, I welcome
01:12:05 to number 25 Minecraft mining dirt, let's play it today, we're going to spend 25 days
01:12:12 mining dirt.
01:12:13 You know, it's just like...
01:12:14 That was basically my channel.
01:12:16 Yeah, there you go.
01:12:17 But you do real shit.
01:12:18 You do lore.
01:12:19 You did the deep web hacks and stuff.
01:12:21 That's just got a more, more panache, more style, plus you do a bunch of stuff.
01:12:26 Nate, will you please read the pity question from the Twitter, please?
01:12:29 Okay, let's let's let's shift over here, read a little pity question.
01:12:33 Um, what do we got here?
01:12:35 What do we got here?
01:12:36 Please pick a good one.
01:12:37 Okay.
01:12:38 Here's one that's not terrible.
01:12:39 At owl1373, this might be an obvious question, but bear with me here, asks, during the robot
01:12:45 uprising, which PCP member will be most likely to be mistaken for a robot?
01:12:52 Why do you always...
01:12:53 That's a good question.
01:12:55 You just insist.
01:12:56 You just insist on reading the worst fucking question.
01:13:00 That's not...
01:13:01 There possibly is.
01:13:02 That's the end.
01:13:03 Me.
01:13:04 Davoo.
01:13:05 We'll see.
01:13:06 There you go.
01:13:07 Davoo.
01:13:08 Yes, it's Davoo.
01:13:09 No one has seen me.
01:13:10 No one has seen me.
01:13:11 I could be just like an app on your phone.
01:13:12 Oh, yeah.
01:13:13 Mage could be essentially an AI.
01:13:14 Have you guys seen the new iMage?
01:13:15 The new update really fucks everything and destroys the feng shui.
01:13:22 It's called the touch of death.
01:13:25 Oh, jeez.
01:13:26 No.
01:13:27 That was terrible.
01:13:28 That was terrible, Nate.
01:13:29 That was a good question.
01:13:31 You just had a bad attitude.
01:13:32 That's your problem in life, my friend.
01:13:34 You got a bad attitude.
01:13:35 Happy to be...
01:13:36 Look at John Lennon says, final verdict.
01:13:37 Is it safe to mine at night?
01:13:38 A vastly superior question.
01:13:40 Oh, jeez.
01:13:41 It's not...
01:13:42 It's the most obvious question in the world.
01:13:43 Well, it's a complicated question.
01:13:44 It's not safe, but you should probably do it anyway.
01:13:47 Well, listen.
01:13:48 You know, it is your own mind at night on hardcore mode.
01:13:51 Mining at night is, in fact, against God's law.
01:13:55 But that being said, if you live in anarchy, if you live in a world of madness where you
01:14:06 are hidden from the light of God's love, like on 2P2B, or whatever, no, wait, I'm sorry,
01:14:15 whatever.
01:14:16 Did you actually make a mistake?
01:14:17 I thought that was a joke.
01:14:18 No, wait.
01:14:19 2P2T, right?
01:14:20 2P2T.
01:14:21 2P2T.
01:14:22 2P2T.
01:14:23 2P2T.
01:14:24 2P2T.
01:14:25 2P2T.
01:14:26 There you go.
01:14:27 If you're on there, you are hidden from the light of God's love.
01:14:29 And so, like, I'm not saying that you should do it, but I'm saying that you can get away
01:14:34 with it.
01:14:35 But you shouldn't do it anyway.
01:14:36 It is a sin.
01:14:37 It's, of course, a sin.
01:14:38 You probably should do it, though.
01:14:39 Oh, my God, that reminds me.
01:14:40 A few years ago, there was this troll account on 2P2T.
01:14:43 His name was Build Smash, and he basically masqueraded around as this in real life missionary
01:14:50 for God.
01:14:51 And you would constantly post Bible passages and try to correct people on their, like,
01:14:59 arrogant, sinful ways.
01:15:01 Oh, it's like me when I was, like, 13.
01:15:03 That's exactly what I used to do.
01:15:04 Do you remember Bible Bot?
01:15:08 Bible Bot was an offshoot of Build Smash, and it's like, it was the greatest troll of
01:15:12 all time because you've got all these Edgelord Fedoras, and you're trolling them with God.
01:15:18 It is.
01:15:19 It was the worst thing you've ever seen.
01:15:22 Oh, man.
01:15:23 They just can't resist the bait at that point.
01:15:24 Bible Bot is fucking legendary.
01:15:26 I fucking love Bible Bot.
01:15:27 Not Ethan.
01:15:28 He made a discord version of Bible Bot that's still in the works now, but you can do X-Mesh
01:15:34 Point Verse and shit like that.
01:15:35 It's fucking dope.
01:15:36 It's dope as hell.
01:15:37 I love Bible Bot.
01:15:38 Dude, that's sick.
01:15:39 I'm going to scroll up here.
01:15:40 I have a question.
01:15:41 Yeah, I do.
01:15:42 Okay.
01:15:43 By Giffy or Giffy, what do you miss most about old school Minecraft?
01:15:48 Good question.
01:15:49 The no hunger meter.
01:15:52 I miss the oof sound that Steve used to make.
01:15:56 Is that gone?
01:15:57 That's a classic.
01:15:58 Yeah.
01:15:59 Now it's just a cracking of a bone.
01:16:00 Oh, that sucks.
01:16:01 Oh, I hate that.
01:16:03 How old school are we talking about, though?
01:16:06 I miss, I mean, like early beta.
01:16:11 What I miss is the lack of choice.
01:16:14 There's too many blocks, too many colors.
01:16:16 I can't decide on how to like build my base and I always default to cobblestone and wood
01:16:22 because I'm just an idiot and I can't be able to like plan out how to find and get
01:16:26 all these fucking materials.
01:16:27 We didn't talk about Minecraft the actual game, but I want to put on the record that
01:16:33 I think Minecraft was like pretty shit and like not like fun is like a game.
01:16:37 I love to play.
01:16:38 I love to play.
01:16:39 I have to agree because I've never stuck with it whenever I tried to play it because
01:16:44 I just I would always get in there and then suddenly realize like, wait a minute, it's
01:16:50 I've done this before.
01:16:51 I just got to break some trees and build a hut.
01:16:53 That's why I don't want to do that.
01:16:56 I loved Minecraft.
01:16:57 I love the last time I sincerely and truthfully loved Minecraft like vanilla Minecraft.
01:17:02 I play when the horses came out and my biggest goal was like to make like the biggest stable
01:17:07 with all every single type of horse in it.
01:17:09 Oh, that's nice.
01:17:10 Beautiful.
01:17:11 It was so fun.
01:17:12 I distinctly remember the most fun I ever had playing Minecraft and it was I was like
01:17:16 I was playing single player because single player is superior to multiplayer.
01:17:19 That's gay.
01:17:20 It was just I was just dicking around and then I was just like on the wiki because I'm
01:17:23 a total noob learning about like various stuff you can do.
01:17:26 And I decided for myself, I want to build a sugar cane factory.
01:17:30 Once I decided upon that to then have to explore the labyrinthine system to get like all the
01:17:36 components necessary to make that happen.
01:17:39 To make that thing assemble, I needed like I needed like nether or whatever and like
01:17:43 I didn't even know what that is or that the nether even existed.
01:17:46 So I had to like learn about that and how to get there and construct like an obsidian
01:17:49 portal like having a goal for yourself like that and then doing what it takes to get there
01:17:54 and exploring the mechanics that way.
01:17:56 That is the most fun you can have playing Minecraft in my opinion.
01:18:01 Dwarf Fortress was the same like I never like I would like set up you got to make goals
01:18:07 for yourself.
01:18:08 You got to be like, okay, well, how do I build a farm and then you go and you look up how
01:18:11 to build a farm and you try to make it happen.
01:18:13 How do I set up an army?
01:18:14 You go and you look you do research and then you like try and make it happen.
01:18:19 Yeah.
01:18:20 Yeah.
01:18:21 I guess I never really set had like a goal for myself.
01:18:22 That's the big bump.
01:18:23 Once you get that, it gives you a sense of purpose.
01:18:25 I want to say a thing quickly.
01:18:27 I just I just remembered one single complaint I have on Minecraft still to this day.
01:18:31 Like, you know, Apple is a Minecraft, right?
01:18:33 They were like, they're from almost the very beginning.
01:18:35 If not the very beginning, right, we still don't have Apple pie.
01:18:40 That is I am upset if that's true.
01:18:42 Are there pies?
01:18:43 The community needs to answer for this.
01:18:45 Yeah.
01:18:46 Like pumpkins came out.
01:18:47 I think and there was pumpkin pie or something.
01:18:48 Right.
01:18:49 Wasn't there?
01:18:50 I haven't played.
01:18:51 Yeah.
01:18:52 Exactly.
01:18:53 See, well.
01:18:54 And there's cake.
01:18:55 That's true.
01:18:56 That's true.
01:18:57 I said Minecraft is shit.
01:18:58 I had one very specific reason in my mind is because they keep adding shit that I don't
01:19:04 care about.
01:19:05 It just blots up the game as opposed to adding things that I actually care about.
01:19:07 Like, OK, back in the old days, there was just like dirt and there was just like, you
01:19:10 know, like stone in the underground, like those were your blocks.
01:19:13 Now there's like different types of stone, but they both look like shit.
01:19:19 Like they look absolutely awful and you would never want to use them.
01:19:24 And they're just like, I wouldn't be opposed to have like a different type of stone, but
01:19:27 just make it look like an actual human.
01:19:29 They're not like a weird AI.
01:19:32 It looks fucking abysmal.
01:19:33 They keep like weird, awful things that I just think are stupid.
01:19:36 Add good things and then I like it.
01:19:39 There's just too much choice.
01:19:42 When it comes to like designing a castle or designing an interior of a place, it's you
01:19:48 can do anything.
01:19:50 Anything now.
01:19:51 You can have multicolored carpets.
01:19:52 Can we all agree that there's not enough purple in Minecraft?
01:19:56 There's scant.
01:19:57 There's scant.
01:19:58 But you know what I will say.
01:19:59 There's not enough.
01:20:00 I will say.
01:20:02 There was another question that is relevant to this.
01:20:03 It was a fun bill asked, what is your favorite Minecraft block?
01:20:07 And my answer was definitely obsidian, even though it's like the edgy, like literal Sasuke
01:20:11 choice.
01:20:12 Obsidian too.
01:20:13 Yes.
01:20:14 Obsidian is purplish and it makes the purple port.
01:20:15 Old style cobblestone.
01:20:16 Old style cobblestone with the black lines.
01:20:18 Oh yeah.
01:20:19 What did you say, Fit?
01:20:20 What did Fit say?
01:20:21 My favorite is one thing you just are adding now for the next update, the Sea Pickle.
01:20:26 The Sea Pickle.
01:20:27 The Sea Pickle.
01:20:28 The Sea Pickle.
01:20:29 Is the greatest.
01:20:30 I'm not aware of this.
01:20:31 Okay, so they're adding so much new stuff in this update, but it's like too little, too
01:20:36 late because it's been eight years already, but they finally added spears and you can
01:20:42 do a fucking taboon jump in the rain and it's baller as fuck and I've been waiting for
01:20:50 it so long.
01:20:51 Dude, I saw the Trident.
01:20:52 I saw the Trident video.
01:20:53 It was nuts.
01:20:54 That's sick.
01:20:55 God damn.
01:20:56 It's like all this cool shit, but now Minecraft is like going way down a popularity.
01:21:00 It's just too little, too late.
01:21:01 Like they didn't get it yet.
01:21:03 Best block mossy cobblestone.
01:21:06 That's a good one.
01:21:07 Oh dude, I remember whenever me and my friends find like a dungeon and be like, take whatever
01:21:13 you want from the chest.
01:21:14 I don't care.
01:21:15 Just give me the mossy cobblestone.
01:21:16 I only ask for the mossy cobblestone, that's all I care about.
01:21:21 Please, sir, extends out his hands.
01:21:23 Please, sir, just one more mossy cobblestone to sustain me, please.
01:21:27 This cake kind of like a block.
01:21:29 I'm looking at the sea pickle and this looks fucking gross, but like really funny.
01:21:32 Okay, I also like cake.
01:21:33 Actually, I'm not sure if that counts, but whatever.
01:21:36 My favorite.
01:21:37 Well, it's my second favorite.
01:21:38 My favorite block and which I made, like my first 2B2D base was made entirely out of
01:21:45 this material was like melon brick.
01:21:49 I love the melon brick and you can like make your food into like a constructable material.
01:21:53 Well, hang on.
01:21:54 Question, question.
01:21:55 Is that a brick or I thought that those were just literally like melons, like they just
01:21:58 are cubes.
01:21:59 Yeah, they could be used as construction material.
01:22:01 Yeah.
01:22:02 Yeah, well, sure.
01:22:03 Okay, okay.
01:22:04 It's just when you said brick, I thought you had to go through a process to convert
01:22:07 a melon into a brick and that's all.
01:22:09 No, no, no.
01:22:10 Okay, all right.
01:22:11 Yeah, I'm just saying as opposed to like the edible thing.
01:22:13 So it's a literal edible house that you can just eat if you want to.
01:22:15 Exactly.
01:22:16 It's beautiful.
01:22:17 That's sick.
01:22:18 Cakes and melons are the only food sort of things that you can put down, right?
01:22:24 Yeah.
01:22:25 What's that?
01:22:26 Cables.
01:22:27 What's kind of cool about cakes is that on 2B2T when the lag is so severe that you can't
01:22:31 even eat, cakes are the only way to stop yourself from starving to death.
01:22:35 Why cake?
01:22:36 Unless they're a right click and you instantly fill up your hunger bar, whereas with the other
01:22:41 foods you have to have the eating animation.
01:22:43 And it takes like five minutes sometimes if the TPS is below.
01:22:49 So like you'll be trying to eat it, but your stamina will be like ticking down and you'll
01:22:52 just like die before you can actually get the thing in your face.
01:22:55 Yeah.
01:22:56 Okay, all right.
01:22:57 Cake is OP.
01:22:58 Word.
01:22:59 Cake is dead.
01:23:00 I changed my mind.
01:23:02 My actual favorite block is the sign, mostly because of like the history and the memories
01:23:07 that can invoke when you go back to a place that you remember writing a sign in and you're
01:23:11 like, oh.
01:23:12 Oh, yeah.
01:23:13 That happened upon a sign.
01:23:15 The literal words I wrote like five years ago.
01:23:17 I happened upon a sign just at the beginning of 2B2T, right?
01:23:22 Yeah.
01:23:23 Yeah.
01:23:24 All right.
01:23:25 We've come full circle that just said a little arrow not sucking dick 2018.
01:23:34 That was it.
01:23:35 That was a whole scene.
01:23:36 It was good.
01:23:37 Okay.
01:23:38 I feel like everything I said Minecraft is actually the best video game ever made because
01:23:42 of this.
01:23:43 That's what happened.
01:23:44 I remember distinctly saying to one of my friends, dude, you should be able to like write books
01:23:50 like like write.
01:23:51 Oh, yeah.
01:23:52 Wouldn't it be cool to do that?
01:23:53 And they're like, oh, that's never going to happen.
01:23:54 And I was like, yeah, you're right.
01:23:57 Next time you can write in books.
01:23:58 That is a game changer right there.
01:24:01 That is a game changer.
01:24:02 I just remembered with the books one time I had like I hosted a little server like it
01:24:07 was a bit of a role-play server between me and my friends and I wrote the whole story
01:24:10 and they had to follow the story and they had to find books to continue the story and
01:24:14 stuff.
01:24:15 It was really, really fun.
01:24:16 That's awesome.
01:24:17 That sounds fucking sick.
01:24:18 Hey, hey, somebody was just talking about a feature creep.
01:24:19 I just wanted to say that a feature creep is literally what completely broke Terraria
01:24:23 and made Terraria boring and shit because it no longer...
01:24:27 You literally have no fucking brain cells left in that game.
01:24:30 No.
01:24:31 No, Terraria originally had a very clear path line that went from like your base house
01:24:36 then you go to like Jungle Biome once you've built yourself up and you've mined some decent
01:24:39 ore from underground then you eventually get to like the...
01:24:42 I don't even remember like other stuff happens then you get like to the fantasy realm and
01:24:45 then there was a linear path that was fun.
01:24:47 The feature creep literally did not affect that.
01:24:49 It made it so bloated and clunky and annoying.
01:24:53 The features they added didn't add any new fucking biomes.
01:24:56 All they fucking added was more shit to do.
01:24:58 The fucking...
01:24:59 The beehive was a new one.
01:25:01 That's one.
01:25:02 I don't know.
01:25:03 That's just in...
01:25:04 That's just in the...
01:25:05 Okay.
01:25:06 That's just a small structure that is inside of the Jungle so you need to go there anyway.
01:25:11 Pasha.
01:25:12 You're fucking fag.
01:25:13 Terraria is perfect.
01:25:14 Okay, to be fair I haven't actually played Terraria since those updates but it just looks
01:25:17 shitty.
01:25:18 Just looks shitty.
01:25:20 You're fucking rude.
01:25:21 Oh yeah.
01:25:22 Oh, I log into Terraria.
01:25:23 Oh good.
01:25:24 I got like the Santa DLC in my fucking chow...
01:25:25 DLC!
01:25:26 Thank you Terraria.
01:25:27 Thank you Terraria.
01:25:28 You're fucking dead, Nate.
01:25:29 It's basically DLC.
01:25:30 Only spree.
01:25:31 You don't fucking know fucking shit.
01:25:32 Base Terraria was OP and GG to you, Munchie.
01:25:36 Speaking of Terraria, I think it's the same people who made a new game called Staxel which
01:25:41 is kind of like Stardew Valley and Minecraft had a baby and that's a game I like playing.
01:25:46 Didn't...
01:25:47 I didn't...
01:25:48 Behind babies.
01:25:49 Didn't the Terraria people make like some like...
01:25:50 Some like...
01:25:51 Starbound, my friend.
01:25:52 Starbound.
01:25:53 Yeah, some perpetually early access shit hole that I heard was like a big disaster.
01:25:58 Yeah, I don't know.
01:25:59 Hey, hey, fucking fucking Ethan himself asked a good question.
01:26:03 Oh shit.
01:26:04 Yeah, shout out.
01:26:05 But where do you see the future of 2B2T or more broadly if you prefer Minecraft heading?
01:26:10 Oh, great question.
01:26:11 From my perspective, I've seen several Minecraft slash 2B2T YouTubers switch from to other
01:26:16 forms of content altogether and it seems as though the server slash games decline as
01:26:21 of late due to the over-saturation of Minecraft based content.
01:26:24 Hmm.
01:26:25 What do you think, Fit?
01:26:26 This is a good ass question.
01:26:27 What do you think, Fit?
01:26:28 For 2B2T, as long as there's like at least 10 people playing on it and a couple people
01:26:33 pitching in for the server costs, I think it will end once Housemaster just gets bored
01:26:39 of running it.
01:26:40 But here's the thing, Housemaster has a cocaine addiction and he needs to fulfill this cocaine
01:26:46 addiction so he needs as many shekels as he can get with all the players on 2B2T.
01:26:52 He will run this as long as he can, but Minecraft itself, I actually think because it's just
01:27:00 a game that you can put on any platform at this point, I think I see it like still being
01:27:06 played by a somewhat relatively large player base for years to come, I would say.
01:27:11 I agree.
01:27:12 I agree.
01:27:13 I don't think it's going anywhere.
01:27:14 I think that the decline of popularity is actually fucking great for specifically 2B2T
01:27:21 because no one wants to deal with the queues.
01:27:24 That's like the major thing, they like remove the veteran queue I think I haven't played
01:27:28 in a while.
01:27:29 But the main thing is, because 2B2T, a lot of people want to join it, but also it's
01:27:38 not a huge servering thing so you can't have any people on it at once, there's a queue
01:27:43 to get in so you can be put in a 100 player queue and eventually that will tick down and
01:27:48 then when it's your turn you can get inside the server and you can stay there for as
01:27:50 long as you want.
01:27:51 But anyway, the main thing that I think is good is that once 2B2T becomes a niche thing,
01:27:58 I think Minecraft is kind of heading like just generally, obviously it will still be
01:28:02 a big game but it's nowhere near the popularity it had and eventually it will die the death
01:28:08 just became like a niche game.
01:28:09 That will be great because then the community will be small again and you'll just be able
01:28:12 to have that rich, small, you know everyone on the server and you know what their deal
01:28:19 is.
01:28:20 That's great and I love that and I miss that because I joined before the Russia invasion
01:28:24 and stuff.
01:28:26 So I really miss that a small, you know like 30 players on at a time in the middle of the
01:28:30 night.
01:28:31 I miss that and I think it will be good.
01:28:32 Hey, I got two questions here to read, they're very important.
01:28:36 Okay, these won't take long.
01:28:38 First, meme manifest asks a question, do you agree that Minecraft sex mods should make the
01:28:44 boobs more seeable?
01:28:45 Fit?
01:28:46 Would you care to comment?
01:28:49 Like wait, I was reading a statistic, wasn't it like back in 2014 on point hub like Minecraft
01:28:58 was one of the most searched terms, like what the fuck?
01:29:06 It's incredible.
01:29:07 I think if this guy doesn't like the way the boobs look in the Minecraft sex mods, he needs
01:29:12 to get on it and fill that demand himself.
01:29:16 He should be the change he wants to see.
01:29:19 Well you know what, to be fair meme manifest is asking if they should be more seeable.
01:29:22 So I guess it's a taste question he's asking here.
01:29:24 I don't know, it's up to you man.
01:29:27 Why would you have a sex mod?
01:29:29 Have multiple mods man, make a boob slider, you know, let us choose.
01:29:34 Artificial Academy 2 mod for Minecraft.
01:29:39 For Minecraft, yeah.
01:29:40 Oh my god, you know what artificial academy is?
01:29:43 Of course.
01:29:44 Of course.
01:29:45 What a legend.
01:29:46 Um, Mozilla Fennekin asks another question.
01:29:49 Do you even lift FitMC?
01:29:52 Do you even lift?
01:29:53 Oh god, well I mean Nate, you and I are both browsers of the infamous Fit board.
01:30:00 Infamous, that's right.
01:30:01 When I first made my channel a couple years back, I'm like well, I play Minecraft but
01:30:06 unlike most Minecraft players, I actually go to the fucking gym, I just call myself FitMC
01:30:11 and then like, at first my fans were like oh there's probably some fat guy in his forties,
01:30:16 like he's just playing Minecraft all day and then I did my face reveal and they were just
01:30:21 like flabbergasted.
01:30:22 Yep, yep.
01:30:23 Got him.
01:30:24 Dad's on those haters.
01:30:25 Like a true Fit boy, I have an Instagram account too so I have to.
01:30:32 Of course.
01:30:33 Yeah, you have to.
01:30:34 Congrats.
01:30:35 You know, there was the original title for this episode was going to be fitness and
01:30:39 Minecraft.
01:30:40 There's going to be a double topic, extravaganza for FitMC, unfortunately that's lost to the
01:30:45 wins of time.
01:30:46 But you might just be on the fitness and have FitMC back.
01:30:50 Oh, that would be legendary.
01:30:51 Yeah, if you're fucking lucky because you can play your cards right.
01:30:54 All these questions are true.
01:30:55 I have a question.
01:30:56 Oh yeah, yeah.
01:30:57 Yeah, yeah.
01:30:58 By Smickelkun, which do you like more, mining or crafting?
01:31:01 For me, it's definitely crafting.
01:31:03 I love crafting.
01:31:04 I like making things.
01:31:05 But how does one craft without previously mining?
01:31:08 That's a chicken and an egg problem here.
01:31:09 No, no.
01:31:10 See, what do you like more?
01:31:12 It doesn't mean you can't do the other one.
01:31:15 I assume crafting includes building and architecture.
01:31:20 I prefer the crafting.
01:31:21 I think I lean more towards the mining personally because you know I'm a guy who loves grinding
01:31:25 in video games and mining is just like your death.
01:31:28 When you're mining, you can just be mindlessly doing that while listening to some Let's Play
01:31:33 or just content online or something, whatever, man, podcast.
01:31:37 Mining is just like some chill, just tune out and just start whacking blocks and then
01:31:43 with the occasional little dopamine rush when you find something good.
01:31:47 You're always mining for a purpose.
01:31:49 You've always got that.
01:31:50 But when you're in the eight hour grind of mining out your expansive underwater pleasure
01:31:55 dome, then it's nice to just zen out and do that.
01:31:59 I have listened to entire podcasts from beginning to end of an entire podcast while mining.
01:32:04 Sure, me too.
01:32:05 The problem with mining though is that you're doing the same repetitive task over and over
01:32:09 which means you have a lot of time to think and that usually leads to an existential crisis.
01:32:17 Crafting is infinitely better than mining.
01:32:20 Yeah.
01:32:21 Okay.
01:32:22 All right.
01:32:23 If you've got a lot of demons in your head, you're definitely going to lean on the crafting
01:32:24 side of this thing.
01:32:25 What's your suit?
01:32:26 I think it's those.
01:32:27 All right.
01:32:28 Is anything else here?
01:32:29 You want to say?
01:32:30 I think we're good.
01:32:31 I think I'm good.
01:32:32 All right.
01:32:33 Is there anything you would like to plug here at the end here?
01:32:40 In true fashion of being a fitness slash Minecraft YouTuber, follow my Instagram, Fittemps, Sippy
01:32:47 Cup, boy.
01:32:48 All right.
01:32:49 Sippy.
01:32:50 Hell yeah, dude.
01:32:51 Hell yeah, dude.
01:32:52 It's been fucking great.
01:32:53 It's been fantastic.
01:32:54 What a great time to have you on here.
01:32:58 It's so nice that you like our content in general and you know, been watching what we're doing
01:33:03 and great to meet you.
01:33:04 Great to talk to you.
01:33:05 Yeah.
01:33:06 I was trying not to fan boy.
01:33:07 Same.
01:33:08 Same.
01:33:09 I still cannot believe we have fans.
01:33:10 I just can't.
01:33:11 One day.
01:33:12 Doesn't matter.
01:33:13 Here you go.
01:33:14 Here you go.
01:33:15 Yeah.
01:33:16 Oh, it's so true though.
01:33:17 Hashtags stay humble.
01:33:18 That meme with the woman being confused and those math problems around her.
01:33:22 Oh yeah.
01:33:23 Exactly.
01:33:24 Oh man.
01:33:25 So what should we get at the end of Mages OC with like the fans around it, like the names
01:33:29 and like the ads.
01:33:30 Just do.
01:33:31 Mages.
01:33:32 That's a good one.
01:33:33 All right, guys.
01:33:34 I think this is the end of this episode of the Procrastiners podcast.
01:33:37 It's time for plugs.
01:33:38 It's time for plugs.
01:33:39 There's only one more thing you have to say and that is goodbye.
01:33:43 Actually, there are a couple things to say.
01:33:45 For example, if you like our bonus episodes, which I might be editing into this episode,
01:33:50 I can't remember.
01:33:51 We've got like 12 now, pledged fucking five cheap ass dollars, you cheap piece of shit
01:33:56 to our goddamn Patreon.
01:33:57 We've got, we've got to chill, my dude, Patreon people, five dollars, all the bonus episodes.
01:34:03 What was the last one?
01:34:04 I can't remember.
01:34:05 We just did it the other day.
01:34:06 We just did a Radcon 3 recap.
01:34:09 Right.
01:34:10 We went truly behind the scenes.
01:34:12 The Radcap.
01:34:13 That is what I was trying to say.
01:34:14 There's a little bit of private behind the scenes Radcon discussion in there.
01:34:18 That's good shit.
01:34:19 Plus all the other ones.
01:34:20 So it's a cornucopia of good shit.
01:34:21 And if you pledged as low as one dollar, you get into the Discord chat.
01:34:24 So give us as much money as you please and you get to hang out with us some more.
01:34:28 Hey, send us, follow us at TPCraftSnators on the Twitter.
01:34:32 We do the questions there for free and if you're not paying any money, then you probably
01:34:35 won't get your question picked.
01:34:37 But we put out updates in there stuff, so it's good to follow us there.
01:34:40 And subscribe and like.

01:34:49 But it's not just sand, there's dirt.
01:34:54 Yeah, it's time to go, everybody.
01:34:56 Thanks for listening and we will see you next week.
01:34:58 Bye bye.
01:34:59 Bye.
01:35:00 I'm supposed to be working right now, I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm not working.
01:35:20 I'm doing nothing, my dick I'm jerking, myself I'm sucking, I am an asshole, I am a stupid,
01:35:33 I've got a deadline, don't want to do it.
