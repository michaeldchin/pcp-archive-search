00:00:11 Last month's episode was Game of Thrones.
00:00:14 The books really are way better.
00:00:17 Reading is boring and reading is for little babies.
00:00:19 It's so much- okay.
00:00:20 There's just so much superfluous shit.
00:00:23 No, that's the good stuff. God damn it.
00:00:25 No, no.
00:00:26 He fucking let the thoughts get to him, man.
00:00:28 He let the thoughts get to him in a proud mig-towel like Littlefinger.
00:00:31 I just cannot buy that what the fuck happened to that guy.
00:00:34 Is Arya Stark OP? Yes or fuck yes?
00:00:37 Yeah, to watch her obliterate literally every religious person in the world was-
00:00:43 That was the fucking-
00:00:44 That was your apiest dream, wasn't it?
00:00:46 The girl said, you know nothing, Jon Snow, and I want Jon to say, and now I know.
00:00:51 That's Patreon.com slash The Pro Crastinators, making you squeal like a pig every single time.
00:01:12 Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Inside the PCP Studio.
00:01:19 We are delighted to welcome this evening all the members of the PCP who had 10 minutes to spare.
00:01:27 Stolen directly from the show we're ripping off, our guests will be answering 10 intimate questions.
00:01:34 We will be diving deep into the troubled pasts and unhinged psyche of our fair guests.
00:01:42 And by the time we are through, you may find yourself cognizant of just what the fuck actually even is the deal.
00:01:52 Let us begin with our first guest.
00:02:00 As our first guest on the stage tonight, we welcome the runt of the litter, the baby junior,
00:02:07 the lowly creature on the lowest point on the totem pole, the creature with every feature that a human being can have,
00:02:17 the strongest baby in the world weightlifting championships, the master of spice and anger, and he's cool.
00:02:28 Welcome, everyone. Munchy, where's Tiny Hats?
00:02:32 I was going to be the next in the line of the Greek gods succession. I'm haired to the throne of Zeus, and I was plucked up from the ground too early.
00:02:41 I wasn't able to complete my metamorphosis. I was growing inside the ground much like a potato, and I was plucked beforehand.
00:02:48 So I'm not a god yet. I'm half mortal. My only weakness is that I'm completely and utterly successful to all sorts of marketing and advertising.
00:02:59 And if you even slightly suggest to me that I should buy something, I will do it. That's my only flaw. Otherwise, I'm completely immortal.
00:03:08 Artist. Yes.
00:03:11 Podcaster.
00:03:14 Inventor of the arm. Retriever. Retriever of arms, indeed. Indeed. His career is as illustrious as his body mass is extensive.
00:03:26 He's known for all these things and more.
00:03:28 My waistline is almost as dense as the horizon for which my future, where my future rests upon.
00:03:35 My future is so broad and dense, much like my gigantic fucking stomach that I will use to consume all of you meager, mean, minuscule before me.
00:03:46 Like one fucking, like with one fell chomp. I shall obliterate you. I am here.
00:03:52 Indeed. And let's get into that process immediately.
00:03:57 Munchy, what is your favorite word?
00:04:00 My favorite, I should preface this, which I have extensive notes for all of these intense and rigorous military grade questions you have said before me.
00:04:11 I've read them all complete in utter sincerity and none of them possess any of my, you know, trademark tact or addiction.
00:04:20 And all of them will be completely straight. There will be no jokes. In fact, I probably won't even be speaking for most of them.
00:04:28 I'll just be communicating like so vividly through my thoughts and actions. I'll be blinking in Morse code, so just please bear in mind that.
00:04:37 When you just hear, you know, that's me communicating at my highest level.
00:04:42 Right.
00:04:43 All right. So my favorite word is my, I should say my favorite phrase to hear is either thank you or good job.
00:04:50 But if you want to be a real stickler and force me into just one word, I like the word nautical for some reason.
00:04:56 I wish it was like a variant of awesome or cool instead of pertaining to like sea bass aesthetics.
00:05:01 Like I want to just be like, dude, that's like nautical.
00:05:05 Dude, pass me that fucking nautical pussy, dude.
00:05:11 Yeah.
00:05:12 Good. Yes.
00:05:13 Thank you. What is your least favorite word?
00:05:15 I don't know if I even have a least favorite word like, like, like context will mean anything.
00:05:20 So like any word, like even really like detestable words like, like quiche or like clitoris.
00:05:25 They have their uses in some context.
00:05:29 Yes. Thank you.
00:05:31 Yeah.
00:05:32 What turns you on, Munchy?
00:05:34 What an awful question. I'm against all forms of being turned on, especially spiritually.
00:05:40 No, it's open to interpretation. Yeah.
00:05:42 Spiritually, creatively, emotionally.
00:05:44 Your Kundalini Bear Bee is flaccid as my eternally, erectile defunct triple inch pinch,
00:05:50 or I'll turn your clit into fucking roadkill with my steamroller.
00:05:55 Okay, but seriously.
00:05:56 Okay.
00:05:57 There's no one way to get me in like the creative mood or whatever.
00:06:00 Like anything from like coffee to like short deadlines will get me there.
00:06:03 You want my inspirational G-spot?
00:06:05 It's like blasting fucking like gay ass like weird earthbound music into my ears
00:06:11 and running for a real long time so I get all huffy and puffy.
00:06:14 That's what I'll do.
00:06:15 Whenever I need to get in the creative mood,
00:06:17 I'll just like turn on like the earthbound soundtrack,
00:06:19 blast it so like my ears start hurrying after a while
00:06:21 and just run down my street as fast as I can.
00:06:27 Yeah, great.
00:06:28 What turns you off?
00:06:30 Any sort of like messy work environment or like clutter in my brain.
00:06:34 If I'm like particularly annoyed or frustrated,
00:06:37 it'll lead like psychic residue in my cranium,
00:06:39 make it hard to like focus on anything.
00:06:41 So I have to like have my room be cleaned, which is never.
00:06:43 And I have to not be like angry at the world, which is also never.
00:06:49 Indeed.
00:06:51 What is your favorite curse word?
00:06:53 I'm really into it as I'm sure everyone in the audience knows a racially charged slurs.
00:06:58 Out of all the curse words, they undoubtedly carry the most weight.
00:07:01 And rightfully so because they're fucking barbaric.
00:07:04 Indeed.
00:07:05 My favorite is the classic nigger.
00:07:06 I mean, it's definitely my most used.
00:07:08 I don't actually say it as much as I used to, I think,
00:07:10 despite that being the go-to flanderization of me.
00:07:12 It's kind of boring at this point.
00:07:14 Like when not even an inbomb can elicit an eyebrow raised from your friend's circle,
00:07:18 you need to get, you know, you need to get some new material and probably better friends.
00:07:23 Indeed.
00:07:24 Indeed.
00:07:25 What sound or noise do you love?
00:07:29 Have you ever played Lego Star Wars the complete saga for Xbox 360?
00:07:34 Unfortunately, I have not, but I'm sure our illustrious audience has.
00:07:37 Yeah, yeah.
00:07:38 In that game, there are 10 collectible items in each level called mini kits.
00:07:41 And if you collect them all, you can build like a small Lego set
00:07:44 based off the level you just played in the overworld.
00:07:46 I never gave a shit about 100% completing games until I heard the noise
00:07:51 that blasts through your fucking speakers when you pick up a mini kit.
00:07:54 I don't even know if I can describe it.
00:07:56 It's simultaneously the most gratifying, orgasmic sound you'll ever hear
00:08:00 and probably the worst fucking god-awful goddamn like train crash of noise
00:08:05 you'll ever be fucking earrape with because the game is so loud on that sound effect
00:08:08 in particular as opposed to the rest of the game.
00:08:10 I'm going to try and demonstrate here.
00:08:13 PUSH-A-WING!
00:08:15 That's what happens whenever you get like a positive collection.
00:08:18 PUSH-A-WING!
00:08:20 That's the sound of a job well done.
00:08:22 Yeah, it is. It is.
00:08:25 Well, then what sound or noise do you hate?
00:08:28 I'm pretty much in love with every sound conceivable,
00:08:31 even like unsettling or comfortable noises like moaning or licking.
00:08:36 I can get down in if the context is right.
00:08:39 For instance, if the moaning is the moan of a sad African child that I'm working to death
00:08:44 in order to fund my blood diamond operations,
00:08:47 then I can really get behind that.
00:08:49 But in all of the context, I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass that by.
00:08:52 I don't know if there's anyone against, it's all context.
00:08:56 Fair enough.
00:08:57 What profession, other than your own, would you like to attempt?
00:09:01 I fantasize about myself in various odd contradictory and like totally removed
00:09:06 from my actual skill set type job.
00:09:08 It's basically every day.
00:09:10 I like look out the window on the bus
00:09:12 and think about the things that I'll do when I open a restaurant
00:09:15 without actually having any knowledge or desire to cook above the popcorn level.
00:09:19 I can't even really imagine doing anything other than drawing.
00:09:22 Since like, Patreon has existed for as long as I could have eased,
00:09:26 feasibly actually started working.
00:09:28 That's how much of a baby I am.
00:09:30 Since I'm surrounded by creatives in my life,
00:09:32 I don't even really consider it an option to be like a construction worker or something.
00:09:36 And I'm too focused on drawing to actually have even like really dabbled in other mediums
00:09:40 that I see, to like see if I like them or anything.
00:09:43 Like painting, I don't know.
00:09:45 Maybe, like a little, maybe.
00:09:47 I don't know.
00:09:48 All that being said, I've kind of wanted to be a teacher
00:09:51 in the way, way back in my head.
00:09:53 Like one perished soul.
00:09:57 A while ago.
00:09:58 Maybe a chef, if I learn how to fry an egg.
00:10:01 Something like that.
00:10:03 Teacher, chef, blood diamond operator.
00:10:06 All those sorts of things.
00:10:08 Are right up my sleeve.
00:10:10 Slave master slash driver.
00:10:12 Auction, block, hawker.
00:10:14 Have you ever seen Indiana Jones and the Tip of the Doon?
00:10:16 Human trafficker.
00:10:17 That but for real.
00:10:19 That but in real life.
00:10:22 Excellent.
00:10:23 What a rich tapestry we're weaving here.
00:10:25 What profession would you not like to do?
00:10:29 Any job where I'm responsible for people's lives.
00:10:32 Like being like a doctor or a lawyer.
00:10:34 Like that would like put me in an early shallow grave.
00:10:38 My hands are too shaky and my brain is too empty
00:10:41 to be as noble as those dentist and airplane pallets out there.
00:10:44 I fucking will salute them until the day I die.
00:10:47 And I do not have, I do not have the mental fortitude
00:10:50 in order to like pluck a teeth out.
00:10:54 Hmm, I see.
00:10:55 With any tact.
00:10:56 And that is.
00:10:57 Of course.
00:10:58 And lastly, Munchy, if heaven exists,
00:11:01 what would you like to hear God say
00:11:03 when you arrive at the pearly gates?
00:11:06 Not that.
00:11:07 First of all, instant and incessant assurance
00:11:11 that I'm not in hell.
00:11:12 Basically for the rest of my existence.
00:11:15 Would you be in doubt about this?
00:11:17 Yes.
00:11:18 Why would you need assurance of this?
00:11:19 Even if he says that I'm in heaven,
00:11:21 I will never believe him.
00:11:23 No matter what happens, I will believe that I'm in hell.
00:11:26 It sounds like to me, you're creating your own hell
00:11:29 regardless of the circumstances by thinking that.
00:11:32 That's correct.
00:11:33 Why doubt that you are in heaven
00:11:37 when God himself is assuring you of it?
00:11:39 Who's to say that's not the devil?
00:11:41 Who's to say that is God?
00:11:43 Who's to say?
00:11:44 But if your day to day experience in heaven is like good,
00:11:48 why would you then think, oh no, what if I'm in hell?
00:11:50 Like as long as you're having a good time,
00:11:53 what's there to doubt?
00:11:55 Have you ever seen that one episode of the Twilight Zone
00:11:58 where the fucking gangster goes to heaven
00:12:00 and then he goes to the casino day in, day out
00:12:03 and he just keeps waiting at the casino to the point
00:12:05 where there's no stakes anymore
00:12:06 and he knows he's just gonna get win
00:12:08 and crush all the puts that he wants
00:12:09 so that life has no stakes anymore?
00:12:11 That's what I'm assuming heaven is.
00:12:13 Okay, okay, I see.
00:12:14 That makes sense.
00:12:15 So if everything is just peachy and good,
00:12:17 I'm assuming that I will be in hell.
00:12:19 So I need God to tell me,
00:12:21 every single morning when I wake up
00:12:22 and every single night when I go to bed
00:12:24 I'll be in heaven, indeed, in heaven, just to make sure.
00:12:26 And then after that's all said and done,
00:12:28 maybe like a fatherly pat on the back
00:12:30 and like my room key to where I'll be in heaven.
00:12:32 Also, preferably at some point we can reenact
00:12:34 the final battle from the Simpsons game
00:12:36 for Xbox 360 sometime as well.
00:12:38 Where God plays DER with the Simpsons
00:12:41 and in each stage you have to destroy
00:12:43 a new video game system in order to damage God.
00:12:46 That's what I would want to do.
00:12:48 Well, so it shall be.
00:12:53 Well, thank you for sharing this with us, Munchy.
00:12:56 We know that you're a busy man,
00:12:58 so kindly get the fuck off my stage.
00:13:05 And now the PCP studio is proud to bring you
00:13:08 the heart and soul of this organization,
00:13:11 the editor at large,
00:13:13 the big hair, lion main guy.
00:13:17 He loves roller coasters when they're in tie.
00:13:21 They're in typhoons, as I recall.
00:13:24 And here he is.
00:13:26 He's the DeVoo, everybody.
00:13:28 I am definitely not, however, an editor at large.
00:13:30 There's basically no one else but DG
00:13:32 and a few others who I would be willing to edit for.
00:13:36 You'd have to have really interesting videos
00:13:38 for the editing of them to be interesting enough
00:13:40 to be worth doing.
00:13:42 My apology will be etched on my tombstone.
00:13:47 Now, let's move on to the questions here.
00:13:52 Question number one.
00:13:54 DeVoo, what is your favorite word?
00:13:57 Power.
00:13:59 It's because it's so hard to decide
00:14:05 what your favorite word is.
00:14:06 You can only look at external data,
00:14:08 external to yourself asking the question.
00:14:10 And the external data I collected was remembering
00:14:13 that just every time I got back from work
00:14:16 at a job I didn't want to do,
00:14:17 or got back up on the horse from some lack of inspiration,
00:14:20 or just anything where I'm finally in the zone again,
00:14:23 I can't help but yell to myself,
00:14:25 power, power, power, power, over and over again,
00:14:28 a bunch of times.
00:14:29 I'm not exactly sure why,
00:14:31 but I would just sort of silently scream it to myself
00:14:34 a lot of times, the word power just a bunch of times.
00:14:36 Don't really know the meaning of that,
00:14:38 but it must be my favorite word then.
00:14:41 Fascinating.
00:14:43 Question two.
00:14:44 What is your least favorite word?
00:14:46 Bias.
00:14:48 It is used very obnoxiously,
00:14:51 very flippantly,
00:14:53 very pervasively,
00:14:55 not just in the reviewer sphere,
00:14:57 but all around.
00:14:59 And I guess when I press people to define it,
00:15:03 the definition works well enough,
00:15:05 but it's used in a way that makes it meaningless.
00:15:08 It's just like, you have an opinion
00:15:10 because you have an opinion,
00:15:12 or you're doing something with a certain slant
00:15:15 relative to some ideology or another,
00:15:17 because you do.
00:15:18 You know, it's always the way it's used.
00:15:20 It's always like, you have this opinion
00:15:22 because you have this opinion, therefore,
00:15:24 your opinion doesn't matter or isn't valid.
00:15:26 And it's really obnoxious,
00:15:28 and it obstructs a lot of conversation.
00:15:30 Hmm.
00:15:32 Davoo, you are by far the quickest responder
00:15:35 of all our illustrious guests,
00:15:37 yet thus far today.
00:15:39 I looked up the questions that you posted on an image,
00:15:42 and I just typed them all into a notepad ahead of time.
00:15:45 That explains everything.
00:15:47 Let's move on.
00:15:49 What turns you on?
00:15:51 Unmet needs in the world,
00:15:54 or to myself, right?
00:15:56 I can't artistically inspire myself,
00:15:59 or even just physically inspire myself.
00:16:01 If I can't see it working towards
00:16:04 a grand goal of something that will really matter
00:16:07 and make a difference,
00:16:09 and by difference, I don't mean people
00:16:11 dying of cancer or some shit, who cares about that,
00:16:13 but a certain type of video game
00:16:15 or a certain type of video that doesn't exist
00:16:17 and needs to exist,
00:16:19 and that's the thing.
00:16:21 I think a lot of artistically-minded people
00:16:23 spend a lot of their time doing two things,
00:16:25 but never at the same time.
00:16:27 A lot of the time they spend their time
00:16:29 getting mad about all the art that doesn't exist,
00:16:31 that they wish could exist.
00:16:33 If only there could be an action story
00:16:35 to this trope that all of them have
00:16:37 that I'm really sick of, right?
00:16:39 Do that all the fucking time.
00:16:41 Another thing artistic people do
00:16:43 is they spend their time looking at a blank canvas
00:16:45 and going, I just don't have any ideas.
00:16:47 If you just combine those two hobbies,
00:16:49 those two pastimes,
00:16:51 then you just make a thing
00:16:53 that is the thing that you want to exist.
00:16:55 Why can't there just be a video game that does this?
00:16:57 We'll make that video game.
00:16:59 Unmet needs, that's what gets me the most hyped
00:17:01 to make things or be inspired.
00:17:03 What turns you off?
00:17:05 Having to do boring things for people.
00:17:07 Like, hey, can you go
00:17:09 drive to this place
00:17:11 to do this thing, to get a thing
00:17:13 and then take it over here?
00:17:15 Because it always takes longer than you want
00:17:17 or you expect or you're told.
00:17:19 There's always something that requires you
00:17:21 to just stand there for 30 minutes
00:17:23 waiting for it to happen.
00:17:25 Usually it's just, once you let
00:17:27 that bathtub drain of
00:17:29 your productive day get unplugged,
00:17:31 it's gonna mostly drain out
00:17:33 before you can cap that shit back on.
00:17:35 The thing about doing things
00:17:37 is that it always takes three times longer
00:17:39 than it advertises.
00:17:41 It's like a 30 minute drive.
00:17:43 Well, that means 30 minutes of getting ready
00:17:45 and 30 minutes of chilling out after you get back
00:17:47 to recover your senses.
00:17:49 Everything takes exactly three times longer
00:17:51 than you expect.
00:17:53 Oh, a week long trip.
00:17:55 That's a week of you getting nothing done preparing for the trip
00:17:57 and then a week of you getting nothing done recovering from the trip.
00:18:00 It's a good rule of thumb.
00:18:02 What is your favorite curse word?
00:18:04 Face.
00:18:06 I'm sorry, face?
00:18:08 Yeah, because people always talk about
00:18:10 like the sort of, what would you call it,
00:18:12 the primers of
00:18:14 of swears, right?
00:18:16 Like what is the cracking of the whip?
00:18:18 But we don't put as much emphasis on
00:18:20 what you call it, the conjunctions of swears
00:18:22 and face is like a fantastic conjunction
00:18:24 or whatever you call it.
00:18:26 So as opposed to emphasizing the fuck in the fuck face,
00:18:28 you just emphasize the face.
00:18:30 Fuck face, shit face, bitch face,
00:18:32 cunt face, right?
00:18:34 It's like face kind of gets in on
00:18:36 gets in on all that. And I love using face just
00:18:38 just raw, like fuck it.
00:18:40 Your face, me and my brother like to say
00:18:42 you face case, you know,
00:18:44 it's just fun to say face.
00:18:46 It's just very fun to say.
00:18:48 Interesting.
00:18:50 What sound or noise
00:18:52 do you love?
00:18:54 I broke this into two categories.
00:18:56 The broad favorite sound
00:18:58 is rain, you know, very generic one.
00:19:00 My very specific one, my favorite
00:19:02 video game sound effect
00:19:04 is the laughter sound effect
00:19:06 of a guest in roller coaster tycoon.
00:19:08 They have this very chipmunk-esque
00:19:10 chirp and it's really pleasant.
00:19:12 It really just warms my soul.
00:19:16 How was that sound effect
00:19:18 carried over to the later roller coaster
00:19:20 tycoons? Did it get lost in translation?
00:19:22 Oh, well, yeah, the second game still has it.
00:19:24 The third game, I don't remember, probably something
00:19:26 stupid, like, you know,
00:19:28 I don't know about the fourth game
00:19:30 I never really watched any footage of that or played it.
00:19:34 Would you say, well, actually, I'll just
00:19:36 leave it up to you. What sound or noise do you hate?
00:19:38 Okay, so the broad one
00:19:40 that I hate the most is the radio.
00:19:42 The way that the radio sounds
00:19:44 be it AM or FM, FM's
00:19:46 a little bit better, I think. No, it's kind of
00:19:48 worse. Like, it's more pleasant
00:19:50 to the ears, but it's more nauseating to my
00:19:52 stomach. Everything about the radio
00:19:54 It falls more into the sound Uncanny
00:19:56 Valley, perhaps? Yeah, something like
00:19:58 that. Like, the way it's mixed, the way
00:20:00 that, like, car speakers emit it
00:20:02 especially when it's in a car.
00:20:04 It's bad enough that in a car I'm already getting
00:20:06 a little bit motion sick because I'm kind of prone to that.
00:20:08 But, like, the radio just stirs the pot,
00:20:10 literally, the pot of my stomach
00:20:12 and the way that music
00:20:14 sounds on it bothers me, but especially
00:20:16 the way that all radio talk people, be they
00:20:18 DJs in between songs or talk show hosts
00:20:20 they sicken me
00:20:22 unless they have a very distinct charismatic
00:20:24 voice and they can power through it. But if they're just
00:20:26 the generic, like, and now we're going to be
00:20:28 talking over here. Oh, yes, and I'm the woman talking
00:20:30 over here. We're going to be, like, talking about stuff
00:20:32 and then mildly chuckling at one another. That's right,
00:20:34 we are. I want to die. I want to puke
00:20:36 every single time. I don't know what it is. Something
00:20:38 about the microphones they use at the studio, the way
00:20:40 the speakers set up, the way that they are trained to speak
00:20:42 it kills me. And
00:20:44 my least favorite, very specific sound
00:20:46 effect is the
00:20:48 sort of stinger sound effect
00:20:50 that escapistmagazines.com
00:20:52 uses. I don't know if they still use it, I think
00:20:54 they do, on all their shows.
00:20:56 It's, like,
00:20:58 HA!
00:21:00 And do you know what I'm talking about?
00:21:02 I mean, it's weird, because I almost have a weird
00:21:04 Stockholm syndrome
00:21:06 for it, because when I hear it, I immediately,
00:21:08 my mind swells with
00:21:10 You think you're about to watch a Zero Punctuation?
00:21:12 Yeah, yeah, my mind swells with a Zero Punctuation sound
00:21:14 effect, with the extra credit theme song,
00:21:16 with the movie boss theme song.
00:21:18 See, I've never heard that outside the context of a Zero Punctuation
00:21:20 board, you need to realize. And with Jim position.
00:21:22 So many fucking
00:21:24 openings, I think of when I hear it,
00:21:26 but I still hate it. It's really fucking obnoxious.
00:21:28 It's, the
00:21:30 swishing of
00:21:32 the pen, the swishing of the pen
00:21:34 has sort of like this
00:21:36 anti-ASMR effect for me.
00:21:38 For people into ASMR, a lot of them are aware of, like,
00:21:40 it can be ASMR in a bad way that pisses
00:21:42 you off, and it sort of, like, rolls
00:21:44 you into this obnoxiousated
00:21:46 state. But then it, like,
00:21:48 punishes you with this obnoxious fucking
00:21:50 scream, and I don't know why they thought
00:21:52 that was, like, good marketing. It's, like, to be as earwormy
00:21:54 as possible. I don't, I don't, I don't get it.
00:21:56 Like, if they're trying to, like, gain more,
00:21:58 you know, viewers and shit, maybe they should, like,
00:22:00 introduce better content more
00:22:02 than, like, every other decade.
00:22:04 A question for the ages.
00:22:06 What profession, other than
00:22:08 your own, would you like to attempt?
00:22:10 The one
00:22:12 I most am frustrated with myself
00:22:14 for not being, but no I never could be
00:22:16 just because it would take too much
00:22:18 time, is data
00:22:20 slash fact researcher.
00:22:22 The problem with all opinions,
00:22:24 be they political or anything
00:22:26 about history or anything at all,
00:22:28 there's always this issue of, well,
00:22:30 fact X, Y, and Z says this,
00:22:32 so clearly it's proven. Then someone else goes,
00:22:34 yeah, well, here's facts A, B, and C
00:22:36 completely contradicting it. And it's, like, well,
00:22:38 shit. I don't, I'm stuck.
00:22:40 Now I can't, I can't believe anything, right?
00:22:42 But I know that if you
00:22:44 research something enough, eventually
00:22:46 the cracks in genuine
00:22:48 misinformation show
00:22:50 and you can tell when something
00:22:52 is legit or not, right? Like, you know, you can never
00:22:54 confirm everything, but
00:22:56 no one's gonna fucking, like, tell me some
00:22:58 video game history fact and convince me
00:23:00 otherwise. Like, I've seen the same information
00:23:02 like, echoed by
00:23:04 enough sources that you can,
00:23:06 like, a genuine sense of truth
00:23:08 can emerge from within. But
00:23:10 unless you spend all your time
00:23:12 learning avenues of information
00:23:14 you can't get that intuitive sense of true
00:23:16 fact. And so I'm constantly
00:23:18 fucking stuck. And
00:23:20 I just wish that people could always,
00:23:22 I just want to, like, go and, like, see things that people
00:23:24 are arguing about on social media, but no one's
00:23:26 ever, like, taking the time to research and then,
00:23:28 like, research it. Like, like, actually
00:23:30 look at all the data and, like, like, come up
00:23:32 with my findings.
00:23:34 So you want to sort of forge your own
00:23:36 career path here, interrupting people's
00:23:38 social media interaction to let them know where
00:23:40 the facts lie. Which I think is a valuable
00:23:42 service. Yeah, my favorite one to be would be
00:23:44 who is being, which
00:23:46 political opinion is being more
00:23:48 unreasonable to the president they don't
00:23:50 like? Because the thing that everyone always gets caught up
00:23:52 on is, uh, people are
00:23:54 being mean to the president for this
00:23:56 reason and that reason, to which people are, like, well
00:23:58 people are unreasonable to the previous
00:24:00 president for the exact same reasons.
00:24:02 It's like, okay, are we all,
00:24:04 like, basically I just want to, my favorite one
00:24:06 for me, the golden, the golden goose
00:24:08 of facts, would be to see if I could
00:24:10 mathematically calculate if one political side
00:24:12 is more unreasonable than the other.
00:24:14 Mathematically proven. That would be fucking
00:24:16 satisfying.
00:24:18 Well,
00:24:20 another question for another time. But what
00:24:22 profession would you not like to do?
00:24:24 So I thought about, I mean,
00:24:26 almost any job would be, you know, mind
00:24:28 bendingly boring for me and I just commit suicide
00:24:30 so I wouldn't actually ever do the job, right?
00:24:32 So I'm only, like, counting jobs I actually
00:24:34 would end up doing and not leaving
00:24:36 and that would be, and it's sort of, like,
00:24:38 a very subtle, it's almost the same
00:24:40 as the profession I just said, actually,
00:24:42 but subtly different.
00:24:44 It's being professionally right
00:24:46 where
00:24:48 sort of people for whom... I don't understand.
00:24:50 It's people for whom their job
00:24:52 is to be correct
00:24:54 on, like, the things that they're talking about.
00:24:56 Like, perhaps like a, uh, like a, what's the word?
00:24:58 A witness? What do they call them? A specialty
00:25:00 witness or whatever? No, no, it's like, you know,
00:25:02 it's hookin' YouTube political pundits.
00:25:04 You know what I mean? Like, the people
00:25:06 who have these very specific ideologies
00:25:08 and do a lot of research and education and all,
00:25:10 but, you know, like, the point of their channel
00:25:12 is that they constantly, like, hammer in
00:25:14 their ideology over and over and over again
00:25:16 and their job
00:25:18 is to be correct and
00:25:20 right. And it's especially... Perhaps, like,
00:25:22 a less biased Stefan Malinu
00:25:24 sort of thing? Yeah.
00:25:26 Well, it's like, well, that's the thing, right?
00:25:28 Not to attach you to his name.
00:25:30 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:25:32 Well, well, the problem
00:25:34 is that I think once your job is to
00:25:36 be right, then you've already, like, fucked
00:25:38 everything up, I think. Like, basically
00:25:40 your job, what you wake
00:25:42 up in the morning for is to be
00:25:44 correct about the issue.
00:25:46 And now, like, you've sort of, no matter
00:25:48 how self-aware you are, you've sort of
00:25:50 inserted yourself into this
00:25:52 this fallible, this highly fallible
00:25:54 state where you're just going to become
00:25:56 a demagogue. Like, you can't
00:25:58 control it. Doesn't matter how smart and slick
00:26:00 you are, once the purpose of your waking
00:26:02 up out of bed in the morning is to, like,
00:26:04 promote this idea and to re... I feel
00:26:06 like you'll probably get sucked
00:26:08 into this more easily if you are more
00:26:10 logically accurate. It just
00:26:12 fucks everyone up, because I see so many smart
00:26:14 people, like,
00:26:16 try to be pundits for certain
00:26:18 ideas, and they're just always
00:26:20 fucking stupid, too.
00:26:22 For no reason, other than the fact that they have
00:26:24 to, like, explain how right they are every
00:26:26 day. I don't get it. It's terrible.
00:26:28 I hate it. Sucks.
00:26:30 Complex shit.
00:26:32 And now, finally,
00:26:34 DaVoo, if heaven exists,
00:26:36 what would you like to hear God say
00:26:38 when you arrive at the pearly
00:26:40 gates? That outside
00:26:42 of the boundaries of heaven is just sort of, like,
00:26:44 an infinite plane, like, maybe mountains
00:26:46 and hills and stuff, but, like, you know, lots of just grass
00:26:48 and, uh, you know, you can
00:26:50 do whatever you want, like, you're still immortal
00:26:52 and you won't get sick, but you don't get any
00:26:54 heaven benefits, but you don't have to follow any
00:26:56 heaven rules, so the whole
00:26:58 crippling fear of the very notion of
00:27:00 heaven being a place where you worship God,
00:27:02 i.e. be at church forever?
00:27:04 Yeah, you don't actually have to do that. You can just kind of, like,
00:27:06 fuck off. You don't get, you don't get
00:27:08 God care, I guess. You don't, you don't get
00:27:10 fucking Jesus books, but, um,
00:27:12 you don't get any, like,
00:27:14 faith stamps, right? But,
00:27:16 yeah, you can just go off and, like, just do
00:27:18 whatever you want, like, you can fuck till
00:27:20 the sun comes down, right? Basically, you're, you're getting
00:27:22 a pitch for your ideal heaven
00:27:24 when you, when you talk to God, or he's
00:27:26 explaining to you what heaven's going to, so
00:27:28 how, do you need to eat in this
00:27:30 heaven? Do you need to sustain yourself, or is this
00:27:32 Man, I don't know, but maybe
00:27:34 I don't know. Is it basically just, like,
00:27:36 more life? Well, what I'm thinking
00:27:38 maybe is that, like, your cellular
00:27:40 structure is infinite, right? It's, like,
00:27:42 perpetually restored by your soul,
00:27:44 but maybe your soul
00:27:46 withers away over the course of, like, what would be
00:27:48 the equivalent of millions of years unless you go to
00:27:50 heaven, maybe, right? So maybe
00:27:52 that's how he fucking gets you, right? Like, maybe
00:27:54 he makes you sign contracts, like, you gotta be in heaven
00:27:56 for, like, this amount of time. Do you mean, like, by not going to
00:27:58 heaven, by not going to heaven, so you either
00:28:00 go to hell, or you remain as a ghost
00:28:02 on, on earth? I'm just thinking, like, maybe
00:28:04 the outskirts of heaven is a place where you can go
00:28:06 hollow, essentially, right? Cause, like, your soul
00:28:08 you started making me think about what would be
00:28:10 the, the finite resource of this. I think your
00:28:12 soul would eventually wither away, right?
00:28:14 And so, like, in heaven, your soul
00:28:16 can be restored a bunch of times, or, you know, infinitely.
00:28:18 So, that would be, like, the
00:28:20 push and pull, right? So...
00:28:22 You gotta rest in heaven's bonfire every once in a while
00:28:24 to refill your soul flask, okay?
00:28:26 So, yeah, I'm not expecting this to be perfect,
00:28:28 but, uh, I just, that's,
00:28:30 I just don't, I've never, I've
00:28:32 never fucking been convinced
00:28:34 that heaven would be a good place to live!
00:28:36 Like, all the materials that it's made out of
00:28:38 don't look comfortable. Would you like
00:28:40 to walk around on fucking shiny-ass
00:28:42 roads all the time? It probably, like, gets stuck to
00:28:44 your fucking feet, creating little, like, puddles of sweat
00:28:46 every fucking day.
00:28:48 I don't know. I guess when
00:28:50 I was disgusted, it was always just, like, it'll be
00:28:52 whatever would be perfect for you. It was kind
00:28:54 of how I was explained to it when I was
00:28:56 growing up. It's too vague. It's too fucking
00:28:58 vague. And the idea is that you worship God
00:29:00 all day forever. What the fuck?
00:29:02 Like, who the hell makes
00:29:04 this alternate species just to worship you?
00:29:06 Like... A sycophant.
00:29:08 Yeah.
00:29:10 Well, I'm glad we
00:29:12 tackled that. D'Vu,
00:29:14 thank you. Yes.
00:29:16 Please go and rejoin the collective
00:29:18 and get the fuck off my stage.
00:29:20 This has been the PCP Studio. Goodbye.
00:29:22 See ya.
00:29:24 Ladies and gentlemen,
00:29:26 please welcome to the stage
00:29:28 the one, the only,
00:29:30 Green Ranger, Godzilla,
00:29:32 Tablet Boy
00:29:34 himself, God
00:29:36 King, Lord
00:29:38 of
00:29:40 poverty.
00:29:42 Tom Oliver.
00:29:44 I don't know if I'm the God King. I feel like
00:29:46 Ben Saint was the ruling
00:29:48 poverty man. I'm just
00:29:50 an astute
00:29:52 student
00:29:54 in his mastery.
00:29:56 I've yet to eat out of the trash, but I'm working
00:29:58 way up there, you know? I see you too
00:30:00 as sort of the heads of your two opposing
00:30:02 parties on the war for extreme
00:30:04 poverty domination.
00:30:06 It's a war I wage under duress,
00:30:08 believe me.
00:30:10 Perfect.
00:30:12 Okay, let's
00:30:14 get serious now. This is a serious artistic
00:30:16 time. Mr.
00:30:18 Oliver, what is your
00:30:20 favorite word?
00:30:22 Fuck
00:30:24 is absolutely my favorite word. It's so
00:30:26 flexible. It can be, it's a great,
00:30:28 the great thing about fuck is that it can
00:30:30 be used to enhance everything else.
00:30:32 Anything, any word
00:30:34 that I already like can be made better
00:30:36 when you introduce a fuck, you know?
00:30:38 Like, I like,
00:30:40 I don't even know. Any word you can think
00:30:42 of. It's fucking better
00:30:44 when you use a fucking
00:30:46 prefix to it. It's great.
00:30:48 I couldn't agree more.
00:30:50 But this is not about me. This is about you.
00:30:52 You're the artist here. I am the industry
00:30:54 shill. Question two.
00:30:56 What is your least favorite word?
00:30:58 I
00:31:00 got
00:31:02 two options.
00:31:04 I got two options.
00:31:06 I'm going to lay
00:31:08 them both out.
00:31:10 I don't like moist.
00:31:12 I know it's a very commonly thing.
00:31:14 It sounds weird. It definitely feels weird.
00:31:16 And n-bombs, I don't like
00:31:18 just because it's so phonetically pleasing
00:31:20 to say, but it's socially unacceptable.
00:31:22 So it constantly tempts me.
00:31:24 Those are my two choices there.
00:31:26 Oh, yeah. Oh, big time.
00:31:28 Big time.
00:31:30 Next question.
00:31:32 What turns you on?
00:31:34 And it adds creatively,
00:31:36 spiritually, or emotionally, but again, fuck that.
00:31:38 That's boring. No, it's all about
00:31:40 the sensual
00:31:42 shit, right?
00:31:44 I'm all about
00:31:46 those sick
00:31:48 curves, bro.
00:31:50 Those hard, those like...
00:31:52 He likes them thick.
00:31:54 Ladies and gentlemen.
00:31:56 Well, it's more like
00:31:58 everything in moderation as Aristotle
00:32:00 so
00:32:02 it stutely pointed out all those years ago
00:32:04 which he was totally talking about the ladies when he made that statement.
00:32:06 Everything in moderation.
00:32:08 You've got to find that golden mean, my friends.
00:32:10 That's where perfection lies.
00:32:12 Duly noted.
00:32:14 What turns you off?
00:32:16 Hmm.
00:32:20 Just...
00:32:22 I don't want to say
00:32:24 overconfidence, because
00:32:26 that's pretty nice, but confidence that isn't backed up
00:32:28 by
00:32:30 actual ability.
00:32:32 If you're just blowing smoke
00:32:34 up my ass, or just like...
00:32:36 That's a turn off.
00:32:38 Also, being morbidly obese.
00:32:40 Huge turn off. Can't stand it.
00:32:42 I'm sorry. How offensive of you.
00:32:44 You know, I got to be honest.
00:32:46 This is all about
00:32:48 being true to yourself
00:32:50 and that's what real art is.
00:32:52 It's all about injecting as much of your soul into it.
00:32:54 So I got to be real with you, man.
00:32:56 Injecting as much of your hateful bigotry
00:32:58 as possible. Exactly.
00:33:00 Get to a gym, god damn it.
00:33:02 Do as I say, not as I do, because I sit on my ass too.
00:33:06 What sound... Oh, excuse me.
00:33:08 I was skipping one here. What is your favorite curse word?
00:33:10 I think we might know the answer to this one.
00:33:12 I can't say fuck, because I just did.
00:33:14 That's my favorite word overall.
00:33:16 Oh, you can double up. Are you sure?
00:33:18 I guess... Yeah, fuck.
00:33:20 Fuck's just... It's too good.
00:33:22 It's too perfect.
00:33:24 It just feels great
00:33:26 and it's so versatile.
00:33:28 It's just...
00:33:30 It's fucking perfect.
00:33:32 You see, perfect, if you just say perfect,
00:33:34 it's like...
00:33:36 It's nice, but it's fucking perfect.
00:33:38 It's got that nice
00:33:40 phonetic rhythm to it.
00:33:42 It plays off of everything so well.
00:33:44 It's great. It's the best thing in the world.
00:33:46 It's got just the right amount of, like,
00:33:48 no actual meaning
00:33:50 for it to be used in all situations.
00:33:52 It means everything.
00:33:54 It's just everything and nothing at the same time.
00:33:56 It's the closest thing to god we've ever gotten.
00:33:58 Indeed. Indeed.
00:34:00 What sound or
00:34:02 noise do you love?
00:34:06 The PlayStation 1 boot up is, like,
00:34:08 the best sound
00:34:10 of all time.
00:34:12 It almost... It gets me hard.
00:34:14 99% of the time
00:34:16 it's the best thing.
00:34:18 That should be...
00:34:20 They never should have gotten rid of it.
00:34:22 If I could, like, make every console boot up
00:34:24 and do that at my computer, I would
00:34:26 because it's the best.
00:34:28 What sound or noise do you hate?
00:34:32 The screeching
00:34:34 and crying of babies and toddlers.
00:34:36 The worst.
00:34:38 The worst sound in the world. Absolutely.
00:34:40 Every time I hear that, I had to grow up with the younger sister
00:34:42 so I heard it constantly
00:34:44 and it's deeply embedded in my
00:34:46 DNA now that that sound
00:34:48 makes me want to commit murder.
00:34:50 I think school shooters, they go
00:34:52 to just have less of that sound
00:34:54 in the world. That's why they do it.
00:34:56 I feel for them.
00:34:58 Hashtag we stand with the Columbine
00:35:00 shooters. For sure. He knew it was up.
00:35:02 They handled the other ones.
00:35:04 Yes.
00:35:06 What profession other than your own
00:35:08 would you like to attempt?
00:35:10 I would love to
00:35:12 be a musician more.
00:35:14 I'd love to learn how to do the musics.
00:35:16 I feel like that's the one talent
00:35:18 and skill and ability that I'd like
00:35:20 to spend time grinding out.
00:35:22 It feels like such a gargantuan mountain
00:35:24 decline with all this other stuff. I have no idea
00:35:26 when I'm ever going to be able to get around to it.
00:35:28 That would complete my skill repertoire
00:35:30 and make me a god.
00:35:32 Indeed.
00:35:34 What profession would you not like to do?
00:35:36 I would
00:35:38 hate anything. Anything involving being
00:35:40 stuck in a cubicle all day.
00:35:42 I feel like you might be able to
00:35:44 understand my pains in that one.
00:35:46 Indeed.
00:35:48 You're in a prison.
00:35:50 It's worse than being in prison because
00:35:52 in prison you're locked in, you can't get out.
00:35:54 A cubicle is like a prison but the door
00:35:56 is right there and you know you can't
00:35:58 leave through it even if you wanted to.
00:36:00 It's awful.
00:36:02 You're imprisoning yourself of your own
00:36:04 volition as opposed to being in jail
00:36:06 where you can't get out even if you wanted to.
00:36:08 Hmm.
00:36:10 It's a prison of the mind if you will.
00:36:12 Indeed.
00:36:14 Lastly, if heaven exists,
00:36:16 what would you like to hear God say
00:36:18 when you arrive at the pearly gates?
00:36:20 Here's your 72 virgins.
00:36:22 Which I'm sure you expect
00:36:24 to hear when you get it.
00:36:26 Absolutely. That goes back to the school
00:36:28 shooting and everything.
00:36:30 I'm planning it out. It's going to be great guys.
00:36:32 18 big plans.
00:36:34 It's going to go out with a bang in 2018 everybody.
00:36:36 For sure.
00:36:38 Hashtag plans for 2018. Here we go.
00:36:40 Well, this has been
00:36:42 an honor to discuss these things
00:36:44 with the one and only Green Ranger himself.
00:36:46 Thank you for being here Mr. Oliver.
00:36:48 Please get the fuck off my stage.
00:36:50 Okay, bye.
00:36:52 And now ladies and gentlemen, as a special treat
00:36:54 in her first live appearance
00:36:56 of all time, we have
00:36:58 the one, the only,
00:37:00 the beast from the east.
00:37:02 The purple creature
00:37:04 with no facial feature.
00:37:06 It is lethal aurora mage.
00:37:08 That's one good intro.
00:37:10 Right.
00:37:12 Off the top of my fucking head.
00:37:14 I nailed it. Okay, I'm sorry, but this is serious.
00:37:16 No, you did well.
00:37:18 Round of applause.
00:37:20 Thank you. Oh, and I almost forgot to go
00:37:22 of your credentials. Animator.
00:37:24 YouTube memesmen extraordinaire.
00:37:26 Purple aficionado of all
00:37:28 which we have in common, which we have in common.
00:37:30 A reverence for the color purple.
00:37:32 It bonds us stronger than any blood ties.
00:37:34 Indeed, indeed.
00:37:36 Now, let's get down
00:37:38 to these questions that people
00:37:40 want to know.
00:37:42 Mage, what is your favorite
00:37:44 word?
00:37:46 My favorite word.
00:37:48 And this is particularly interesting since
00:37:50 you're not a native English speaker.
00:37:52 So perhaps it'd be a whole different language.
00:37:54 No, I speak
00:37:56 more English than I do my native language.
00:37:58 So,
00:38:00 English is preferred.
00:38:02 I haven't really thought about it to be quite
00:38:04 honest.
00:38:06 That's the nature of the hot seat that you're in
00:38:08 at this very moment. Oh, no, no.
00:38:10 I'm going to spend 10 minutes contemplating
00:38:12 the reality.
00:38:14 What word do I say a lot?
00:38:16 Oh, fuck.
00:38:18 I should ask my boyfriend.
00:38:20 What your favorite word is?
00:38:22 No.
00:38:24 What's my favorite word?
00:38:26 What's the word I use the most?
00:38:28 Because I swear, no, no, because I'm
00:38:30 put on the spot if I forgot what I
00:38:32 feel. Well, you can define favorite
00:38:34 in any terms that you see fit.
00:38:36 A word that sounds good to you,
00:38:38 a word that you use most commonly,
00:38:40 a word that you just enjoy. What if it's not actually
00:38:42 a word?
00:38:44 I'm willing to accept that.
00:38:46 I think the people are, the people will judge.
00:38:48 I think I might have explained it at some point.
00:38:50 I don't know where.
00:38:52 Snuck-a-snuck
00:38:54 which is a stupid
00:38:56 mispronunciation of the word snake
00:38:58 from this one
00:39:00 video about Pokémon were
00:39:02 real or something like that and they had a snake
00:39:04 but they called it Snuck-a-snuck.
00:39:06 But that's what I ended up calling
00:39:08 my cat and now we call the cat
00:39:10 Snuck-a-snuck. And it's really fun to
00:39:12 say. Am I saying this word?
00:39:14 Snuck-a-snuck.
00:39:16 Snuck-a-snuck, like there's a hue
00:39:18 after the SNN.
00:39:20 Snuck-a-snuck.
00:39:22 Yeah.
00:39:23 Okay.
00:39:24 Well, fascinating.
00:39:25 See, that's great.
00:39:26 That's good stuff.
00:39:27 Okay.
00:39:28 Next question.
00:39:29 What is your least favorite word?
00:39:31 I don't even want to pronounce it.
00:39:35 Oh, come on.
00:39:36 Because I hate it so much.
00:39:37 Please.
00:39:38 People...
00:39:39 No, people are going to harass me with this word.
00:39:42 If you want to spell it, I'll happily say it.
00:39:44 Okay, fine.
00:39:45 But people are still going to harass me, but at least I'll get to not say it.
00:39:49 And then I'll private it to you because out of context it's going to be really weird in
00:39:53 the chat.
00:39:54 Okay.
00:39:55 Okay.
00:39:56 Sure.
00:39:57 Actually, it's going to be really funny in the private chat as well.
00:40:03 Okay, let's see.
00:40:04 It is the word...
00:40:05 Oh, this has become my favorite word.
00:40:14 Okay.
00:40:15 The word, everyone.
00:40:16 Ladies and gentlemen, Maja's least favorite word is Cummys.
00:40:19 Cummys, ladies and gentlemen.
00:40:23 Oh, you know, I can relate to you.
00:40:28 I'm kind of coming around on Cummys.
00:40:30 I'm starting to actually like Cummys.
00:40:32 Well, we'll see.
00:40:34 The degeneracy is sinking in.
00:40:36 Okay, I'm sorry.
00:40:37 Serious face.
00:40:38 This is the PCP studio.
00:40:39 This is a very serious thing we're doing right now.
00:40:42 Okay.
00:40:43 Thank you.
00:40:44 Next question.
00:40:45 What turns you on?
00:40:47 And feel free to interpret that however you like.
00:40:51 Good art.
00:40:53 Good art.
00:40:54 Like good line art, good colors, good position, facial expressions, good key.
00:41:02 Any specific examples you can think of?
00:41:05 I'd have to like find a link of stuff, but that's going to take a while.
00:41:10 I don't really want to bother, but it's just like it's just really good art.
00:41:14 It's the best thing.
00:41:19 What turns you off?
00:41:24 Stupid drama, I guess.
00:41:31 Yeah.
00:41:32 Simple.
00:41:33 Fair enough.
00:41:34 It's just like people just searching or making drama when there doesn't need to be any drama.
00:41:41 Sometimes it's just like something that could be very easily resolved, but then they make
00:41:45 the whole giant deal out of it and it just becomes everyone's problem.
00:41:50 It's so tiring and draining and I just, I don't want any of that.
00:41:56 I think we could all relate to that.
00:41:59 What is your favorite curse word?
00:42:03 What's my favorite curse word?
00:42:07 I don't curse too much.
00:42:12 I've been cursing a lot more in recent years because I feel like becoming jaded.
00:42:19 I've noticed that.
00:42:23 I do say fuck.
00:42:26 I think that's the only swear word I really say.
00:42:29 Sometimes I say shit, I guess.
00:42:31 Is it sure it's a swear word?
00:42:33 Absolutely, absolutely.
00:42:36 Not my favorite, not my favorite one, though.
00:42:40 Well, let's just say fuck due to lack of memory of everybody thinking about the swear words I use.
00:42:48 Fair enough.
00:42:49 What sound or noise do you love?
00:42:53 My cat kneeling.
00:42:55 I just, I love it so much.
00:42:57 He's so cute.
00:42:58 He's currently on my lap and he's purring and snagging me and that's adorable and the best thing.
00:43:04 Unsurprising, an unexpected answer.
00:43:06 What sound or noise do you hate?
00:43:11 Both the sound and the sensation.
00:43:14 I tend to grow my cat just left me.
00:43:22 I grow out of my nails a bit long so when they ever scrape some surface like a wall or something
00:43:31 the sound and the sensation just gets really under my skin.
00:43:38 It's like the nails on the chalkboard sort of thing, you know?
00:43:41 Yeah, that's what comes to mind when you said that, yeah.
00:43:44 What profession, other than your own, would you like to attempt?
00:43:49 I don't have a profession, though.
00:43:52 Well, such as it is, such as it is an online content creator, I suppose.
00:43:56 Yeah, I guess maybe.
00:43:58 What else intrigues you or interests you in this world?
00:44:00 I don't think I really have what it takes to be one, but I think it would be really fun if I could be like an artist for games and stuff.
00:44:09 It's always been on my wish list of things to do.
00:44:13 I've always wanted to make a game where you have to design cute monsters or characters or something like that.
00:44:20 It seems like a fun thing to do.
00:44:22 My art style doesn't really go well unless with mobile games or something simple like that, but yeah.
00:44:31 What profession would you not like to do?
00:44:34 Just like 99% of all professions.
00:44:38 Fair. Anything in particular that seems super odious to you or do you just hate the cubicle idea in general?
00:44:46 I don't hate the cubicle idea. It's kind of intriguing in a way.
00:44:51 Because it's just something so different from my current lifestyle.
00:44:56 It's something I've thought about. Like, what would my life be if I actually worked in a cubicle and my cat is making noise. Shoot.
00:45:04 Indeed. Get off of the PCP Studio stage, Mr. Pussy. This is not for you.
00:45:12 Now, final question.
00:45:14 If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?
00:45:21 You did well.
00:45:24 Hmm. Indeed. Indeed.
00:45:27 I mean, isn't that what everyone wants to hear? You did good.
00:45:34 Everyone has their own answer to that question. And to hear more, keep listening to the other questions.
00:45:40 Not necessarily from God, but just like it's a good thing to hear sometimes.
00:45:46 Understandable.
00:45:48 Well, thank you for joining us. Lethal Aurora Mage, now die off the stage.
00:45:54 I will do. Goodbye.
00:45:56 Goodbye.
00:45:59 Welcome to the stage in the PCP Studio.
00:46:04 We have the illustrious, mud-dwelling, famous, small Hagrid being God King Hippocrite.
00:46:15 Oh, it's me. It's me. I'm Hippo.
00:46:18 There it is.
00:46:21 That's what you sound like. Thank you for joining us. You're taking time out of your very busy schedule to join us, and we appreciate it.
00:46:29 Thank you for being here.
00:46:30 Yes. I changed my voice. I'm the other guy now.
00:46:32 Oh, you're the other guy. Okay, well, that's good.
00:46:34 I'm both your guys.
00:46:35 Oh, yeah, I'm here as well.
00:46:37 Oh, good. We have the whole team. It's like you and your stand. Dude, is that a JoJo reference? Oh, my God.
00:46:44 No, it's a yo-yo reference.
00:46:46 Whoa, sick.
00:46:47 This is the 90s.
00:46:48 I would show you my yo-yo skills, but it's hard to pick up on the microphone.
00:46:53 Okay, right. Questions. Here we go. These are the 10 memes questions. Okay, what am I doing? Okay, here we go.
00:47:01 Question one. What is your favorite word?
00:47:06 Oh, there's so many to choose from.
00:47:12 I used to have like a series of favorite words, but I think I copied them from somewhere. Plinth was a good one.
00:47:19 Oh, plinth.
00:47:21 What does plinth mean again?
00:47:23 It's like a raised platform that you put a thing on, an important thing.
00:47:27 Okay. Like the pussy. You put it on a pedestal, a.k.a. a plinth. That's what we do.
00:47:33 Yeah, you put the pussy on a plinth.
00:47:36 That doesn't sound as good, but I like it.
00:47:43 I'm really bad with my knowledge and brain.
00:47:47 Hey, that's okay. Plinth. Let's go with plinth.
00:47:48 Plinth is all right, yeah.
00:47:50 I don't know how long each question is supposed to be, so please hurry me along if we're too...
00:47:54 Sure, sure.
00:47:56 What is your least favorite word?
00:48:01 There's so many words to choose from.
00:48:03 Oh, I just have a list of words.
00:48:05 Here we go again.
00:48:07 Plinth. No.
00:48:11 Plinth and plinth, two diametrically opposed words, arch nemesis.
00:48:15 I hate plinth because it's not a real word, and it just makes me upset.
00:48:19 It's a terrible word, yeah. It's not even real.
00:48:24 Okay, I guess we're going with plinth.
00:48:26 Okay, there it is.
00:48:27 No, no. I thought I was out of time. Oh, geez, I'm sweating.
00:48:30 Oh, no, no, it's okay. Don't worry, man.
00:48:32 Oh, no, I got it.
00:48:40 Cat.
00:48:41 No, I like cats. That's incorrect.
00:48:44 Oh, no. That's racist against...
00:48:46 Delete that one. Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
00:48:48 No, we're going with that. That's canon.
00:48:50 Okay, moving on to the next question.
00:48:52 What turns you on?
00:48:55 Also, it adds creatively, spiritually, or emotionally, but fuck that.
00:48:59 What turns you on?
00:49:02 Naked ladies.
00:49:04 Yes.
00:49:05 Well, what turns me on is a big pile of mud and sticks.
00:49:12 I like jumping in because the sticks make it crunchy,
00:49:17 but the mud is smooth and it's like really nice.
00:49:21 That's what hippo thinks. I don't know about that.
00:49:24 I can't really relate.
00:49:26 Pretty good.
00:49:28 What turns you off?
00:49:32 Somebody punching me really hard and knocking me out.
00:49:42 You know what I mean? You know what I mean?
00:49:44 Oh, I know what you mean.
00:49:46 Lights out, you know?
00:49:51 Okay, right.
00:49:54 Right, okay.
00:49:56 Next question.
00:49:58 What is your favorite curse word?
00:50:04 I like cunt, but it's always like...
00:50:08 I don't know whether to say the T enough.
00:50:11 You can say cunt, or you can say cunt.
00:50:14 It's more of a mouthful.
00:50:17 I'm not sure whether I like it, but it's very effective when you use it.
00:50:22 I guess fuck, because you fucking say fuck all the fucking time.
00:50:26 It's a very versatile swear.
00:50:33 What sound or noise do you love?
00:50:41 Sound or noise.
00:50:43 I like the clanging of two pieces of wood together.
00:50:51 There's this one song by Elbow where the drummer is like drumming,
00:50:56 but he also has this bit where he just gets two blocks of wood and I saw him do it live.
00:51:00 That's why I know what it is.
00:51:02 I can't do it because I don't have two blocks of wood,
00:51:04 but it's like a very sharp, harsh, echoing...
00:51:09 It doesn't sound like that at all, but it's like...
00:51:15 It's not that. It's more deep than that.
00:51:20 That's what I like. It's like a meaty wood, but really short slice of a sound bite.
00:51:28 If you look at the waveform, you could cut your eyelashes with that waveform if you printed it out.
00:51:37 What sound or noise do you hate?
00:51:40 Sex noises. They're so bad I mute every porn.
00:51:44 Every porn is not... That's why I read Hentai because there's no sound.
00:51:50 There's squishy gross noises. Get out of here.
00:51:57 Also ASMR, which is exactly the same as sex noises, but with a guy's mouth.
00:52:01 I don't like that.
00:52:02 You can do it with women. There's women out there.
00:52:05 You can have sex with women?
00:52:08 So I've been told. I wouldn't know.
00:52:11 Okay, next question.
00:52:18 Profession other than my own.
00:52:22 I don't even know if I have one yet of my own.
00:52:26 Well, you know.
00:52:28 I think if I could decide to do a different thing, and I can, but if I'd completely stop being a YouTuber...
00:52:36 Yeah, just go crazy. Whatever seems amazing.
00:52:38 And I would like to be a rock star.
00:52:41 I would like to be a musician going around the land and saying, yeah, baby, look at that weed.
00:52:49 Look at my guitar.
00:52:52 And then the people would be like, oh man, you're cool.
00:52:55 And I would be like, I know, like Han Solo does.
00:52:59 Yeah, yeah. You could be the next prince.
00:53:03 That's what you should be. Only a hippo.
00:53:07 Moving on.
00:53:09 What profession would you not like to do?
00:53:12 Well, the artist formerly known as Hippocrates. That would make sense.
00:53:15 Ooh, yes.
00:53:16 Because I used to be Hippocrates. All right. What was that question?
00:53:18 The artist formerly known as a Brony Curious, aka Hippocrates.
00:53:23 Yes.
00:53:26 So what profession would you not like to do?
00:53:29 I don't know. Stacking shelves in a shit show.
00:53:32 Store.
00:53:34 In a fake dog shit store.
00:53:36 Stacking them shelves.
00:53:38 No, shoveling shit in a parakeet enclosure.
00:53:41 But only there.
00:53:43 Like, I don't mind shoveling elephant shit, because at least it's like a funny elephant guy.
00:53:46 But with parakeets, they just like, you know, they're screaming.
00:53:49 They're bird screaming. You just got to be there, clean up their shit.
00:53:53 Fuck zoos, man.
00:53:55 Yeah.
00:53:56 Oh, I don't know. I kind of like zoos.
00:53:58 Fuck you. Get out. Get out of here, hippo. You're gay.
00:54:03 And also, I'm going to punch you.
00:54:05 Oh, no, I don't like being punched. I'm getting at it.
00:54:08 Oh, dear.
00:54:09 Now he's ran away. Now he won't come back up in conversation again. He's gone.
00:54:13 Okay. Well, thank God for that.
00:54:15 But we're on to our last question, which is, if heaven exists,
00:54:19 what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?
00:54:24 Yay. Fuck off.
00:54:31 That would make it all worth it. That would make being an atheist worth it
00:54:34 if he was like a cool guy that just told me to fuck off and be like,
00:54:37 you know what? I get it. I like you. I accept hell.
00:54:44 It's all fair game, because you're so rad. So sick.
00:54:48 Yeah.
00:54:49 Yeah. Okay. All right.
00:54:51 Well, that's the end of our questions.
00:54:53 We may have clipped the mic there, but yes.
00:54:56 We prefer that here on PCP Studio.
00:54:59 Thank you very much for clipping that mic.
00:55:02 Thanks for joining us and get the fuck off my stage.
00:55:06 Oh, okay. Thank you. I have a book out. It's called
00:55:09 Go Fuck Me in the Butthole, Please by Hippocrite.
00:55:17 And Stores Now. That's why I appeared on the show
00:55:21 looking my book up my ass. There you go.
00:55:23 All right. Goodbye.
00:55:25 Goodbye.
00:55:28 And now, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage,
00:55:32 everyone's favorite digital creature, Digibro.
00:55:37 Welcome.
00:55:38 Hey, what's going on, everybody? It's me, Digibro.
00:55:43 Digibro, Conrad, entrepreneur, YouTuber, hero,
00:55:50 spiritual leader of a generation.
00:55:53 I feel like a Jedi master.
00:55:55 Welcome.
00:55:57 Indeed. They always give some bullshit intro.
00:56:00 All right. Here we go. Let's get to these questions already.
00:56:02 That's what we're here for, everybody.
00:56:04 All right. Number one, what is your favorite word?
00:56:09 Oh, fuck. It's labyrinth, probably.
00:56:13 I'm a particularly fond of words that are big and complex sounding,
00:56:20 but they sound like architectural, you know?
00:56:23 That works.
00:56:24 Either in that it's describing architecture like a panopticon
00:56:27 or a labyrinth, which are both words I love.
00:56:30 Or that the word itself sounds like a structure like tetragrammaton.
00:56:35 Those all sound excellent.
00:56:38 And there happens to be a manga called Tetragrammaton Labyrinth.
00:56:42 Oh, fuck.
00:56:44 And it's really, really bad, but I own the first volume of it,
00:56:48 and I have never sold it because it's like a meme,
00:56:50 because it's like two of my favorite words.
00:56:52 And that was my Skype name back in the day. You remember that?
00:56:55 Whoa. Yeah, my Skype name was...
00:56:57 I mean, maybe.
00:56:58 Like the actual typed version that you had to type in to find me
00:57:02 was tetragrammaton.labyrinth.
00:57:05 Goddamn.
00:57:06 All of you had that in your Skype.
00:57:08 Deep lore.
00:57:09 All right, that's cool. Maybe I never noticed.
00:57:11 All right, here we go.
00:57:12 Question two.
00:57:13 Oh, fuck. I'm recording it as a wrong audio source.
00:57:16 Oh, no.
00:57:18 Now we've got the right one.
00:57:19 Okay, cool. All right.
00:57:22 Question number two.
00:57:24 What is your least favorite word?
00:57:28 Oh, I don't know. Least favorite word?
00:57:31 Like really any name of any insect,
00:57:34 because hearing it just makes me think about that insect.
00:57:37 And I hate insects.
00:57:39 Or I guess animals in general.
00:57:41 Let's go with dog.
00:57:43 Sick of hearing about fucking dogs.
00:57:47 Fair enough.
00:57:49 All right, here we go.
00:57:50 What turns you on creatively, spiritually, or emotionally?
00:57:56 I mean, James Lipton always just says what turns you on,
00:57:59 but he'd add this bullshit here.
00:58:01 Titties.
00:58:02 Titties.
00:58:03 In all of those ways described though.
00:58:05 Like absolutely all of those ways.
00:58:08 All right, good.
00:58:11 What turns you off?
00:58:14 Dick.
00:58:17 That's a lie.
00:58:19 That's a lie.
00:58:20 What turns me off?
00:58:22 Shit, actually.
00:58:24 Like shit turns me off.
00:58:26 Not into, not into scat.
00:58:30 What is your favorite curse word?
00:58:33 Fuck.
00:58:35 Because it's just, it's so, it's, first of all, has the highest impact.
00:58:39 Second of all, it's the most like malleable.
00:58:43 And it's got a long history, you know?
00:58:45 Like I know a lot of people like cuck,
00:58:47 because it has a lot of the same powers as fuck,
00:58:49 but it's like kind of new, and it's a little tied up in politics,
00:58:53 so it doesn't really have the broad reach,
00:58:55 where like fuck is like the standard classic.
00:58:58 It will always be like the bad word.
00:59:00 Like the go to cool guy bad word.
00:59:03 You know, I think cunt can rise up,
00:59:06 but I don't think it's as versatile as fuck is, so.
00:59:10 Fair.
00:59:12 What sound or noise do you love?
00:59:16 Do I love?
00:59:18 Do you love?
00:59:19 What sound or noise do you love?
00:59:21 I love my wife's voice.
00:59:25 There you go.
00:59:27 Your wife's voice?
00:59:28 Sure, okay.
00:59:29 What sound or noise do you hate?
00:59:32 This fucking computer fan that I can hear going apeshit,
00:59:37 because we're trying to render video at the same time.
00:59:39 Silence.
00:59:41 Did we get disconnected?
00:59:43 Oh, we must have, because I was answering.
00:59:46 Oh, sorry, I couldn't hear that at all.
00:59:48 Yeah.
00:59:49 I mean, if that's good, we'll just cut it in or whatever.
00:59:51 Yeah.
00:59:52 It should be good.
00:59:53 Okay.
00:59:54 I did not hear that at all, but good, yes, understood.
00:59:58 Great answer.
01:00:00 Okay.
01:00:01 What profession other than your own would you like to attempt?
01:00:05 I really want to be a porn manga artist.
01:00:09 Like more than anything else,
01:00:11 if there's one career I could choose for myself,
01:00:14 it would be to draw a porn manga,
01:00:16 to come up with more ideas for it than anything else in the world,
01:00:20 and I have such specific tastes and aesthetic sensibilities for it
01:00:25 that I think I would make something really unique,
01:00:28 but it would take years of drawing practice for me to be good enough to do it.
01:00:34 That's kind of the path that Masamune Shiro took,
01:00:38 and everyone constantly gives him shit for it.
01:00:40 Yeah.
01:00:41 Constantly.
01:00:43 The problem with Masamune Shiro is that he doesn't actually draw a porn manga.
01:00:47 He just draws weird pin-up art that nobody can get into.
01:00:50 If he was actually drawing great porn,
01:00:53 people would have no problem with it,
01:00:55 but nobody likes Masamune Shiro's porn.
01:00:58 I feel like they talked down to him unfairly.
01:01:01 He's earned his place.
01:01:03 No matter.
01:01:04 It's not about me.
01:01:06 Let's see, what profession would you not like to do?
01:01:09 I'm sure that's a broad answer there.
01:01:11 Anything that requires me to wear normal pants.
01:01:19 Fair enough.
01:01:20 And last question.
01:01:22 If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?
01:01:33 All your friends are here.
01:01:38 Good.
01:01:40 Good.
01:01:41 Well, that's it.
01:01:42 Thanks for answering our questions,
01:01:44 and we'll move on to our next cuck.
01:01:48 Yeah.
01:01:50 All right.
01:01:52 Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage
01:01:56 the Mr. Ben Homeless Oculus Rift Trash Drawing Art Saint.
01:02:05 It's my pleasure, Mr. Guy.
01:02:08 Yes, thank you.
01:02:09 Pleasure to be here, as always.
01:02:11 It's truly an honor to have a man dredge himself up from the muck
01:02:16 to be on our stage as you've done here today.
01:02:19 Yeah, Doug.
01:02:20 Well, let's get right down to it.
01:02:22 Question one, what is your favorite word?
01:02:29 Ooh, oh no, oh no, no.
01:02:34 Are you asking everyone the same questions, by the way?
01:02:36 These are all the same questions.
01:02:38 It's a standard set.
01:02:39 My favorite word.
01:02:41 God, I feel like there's so many good ones that I'm blanking,
01:02:44 but I'm, uh, how about, um, how about, I really like, oh no.
01:02:53 Oh God, this is the hardest question I've ever been asked.
01:02:56 What a brain buster.
01:02:58 What a dick tickler.
01:03:00 Effervescent is a pretty good one.
01:03:02 I love evanescence.
01:03:04 Bring me to life.
01:03:05 Hashtag bring me to life.
01:03:09 I really like wither and wence.
01:03:12 I think we should bring them back.
01:03:15 Oh wait, no, the best word.
01:03:17 The best word of all, troper, as in this troper's opinion.
01:03:23 I'm bringing that one back for sure.
01:03:25 Oh, that's a good one.
01:03:26 I'm going with troper.
01:03:27 I'm going with troper, Nate.
01:03:29 What a trooper, bringing back troper, right.
01:03:32 Next.
01:03:33 What is your least favorite word?
01:03:36 My least favorite word is step, but only in the context of when someone says to step foot somewhere rather than to set foot somewhere which is the proper expression.
01:04:06 Okay, good.
01:04:08 Take note, viewers of this crime.
01:04:11 Next.
01:04:13 Protect yourselves.
01:04:14 Indeed, indeed.
01:04:16 Overprotection is better.
01:04:18 No, prevention is the best cure.
01:04:20 Truly, truly.
01:04:21 What turns you on?
01:04:29 Evanescence.
01:04:30 Bring me to life.
01:04:33 Hashtag bring my dick to life.
01:04:36 Um, sex.
01:04:40 And sexy attributes of a person.
01:04:49 Alright, what turns you off?
01:05:00 Did everyone else have as hard a time with these?
01:05:04 Do you by far had the most trouble thus far?
01:05:08 Okay, cool, cool.
01:05:18 What turns you off?
01:05:20 What turns me off is, I don't know, bad vibes.
01:05:28 Bad vibes.
01:05:30 Just unpleasant attitudes.
01:05:35 Disagreeableness, perhaps.
01:05:39 What is your favorite curse word?
01:05:45 Probably something like, something like a heck.
01:05:56 Okay.
01:05:57 Or something like, something British, like wanker.
01:06:00 Or maybe something like trollop.
01:06:04 Like calling some promiscuous lady of the night a trollop is a pretty good one.
01:06:11 Okay.
01:06:12 What sound or noise do you love?
01:06:18 Rain.
01:06:20 Classic.
01:06:22 Yeah.
01:06:23 What sound or noise do you hate?
01:06:33 I hate the sound of indecisive interviewees, truly odious.
01:06:38 Why don't you fucking try it, you piece of shit.
01:06:41 Oh, I will.
01:06:42 We'll see how you do.
01:06:43 I would probably struggle.
01:06:44 You already know the questions, you fucking cheater.
01:06:46 It's true.
01:06:47 It's true.
01:06:50 Power tools.
01:06:51 All of them?
01:06:53 Yeah, just the sound of industriousness, generally.
01:06:57 The sound of things getting done.
01:07:00 The sound of people trying their best, really, you know, replying themselves.
01:07:06 He just wants to escape to his oculus or a fantasy world where nothing is accomplished.
01:07:10 Correct.
01:07:11 Okay.
01:07:12 What profession, other than your own, would you like to attempt?
01:07:18 Other than my own, maybe a writer or a journalist of some kind could be fun, I guess.
01:07:35 I'm surprised by that.
01:07:36 That's interesting.
01:07:37 Well, I don't know, just something about, probably not like an investigative reporter
01:07:44 or anything.
01:07:45 What would you like to write about?
01:07:47 A columnist, I don't know, something that involves just writing my opinions, putting my opinions
01:07:53 out there, you know.
01:07:55 But it's got to be something creative.
01:07:58 It's got to be something that involves my own personal spin on things.
01:08:03 That's interesting.
01:08:04 It's interesting because you kind of, right now, with your work, you're sort of creating
01:08:09 fictional worlds where you could sort of comment through those on, you know, all art is sort
01:08:16 of a demonstration of one's values and whatnot.
01:08:18 Right.
01:08:19 But this would be more of a direct commentary avenue, probably, on these things.
01:08:24 Yeah, I mean, ideally, I'd want to be making something, making fiction of some kind.
01:08:30 But if I, I guess, yeah, I guess if I wasn't doing that, then I guess I would want to be
01:08:35 commenting on the real world or, yeah, or, I don't know, maybe like a literary critic
01:08:43 or something, something where I got a comment on stuff and put my opinions out there.
01:08:47 Ben so desperately wants to be a YouTube critic.
01:08:50 I know, I know.
01:08:51 That's his highest aspiration.
01:08:52 One day.
01:08:53 If only you had the talent or the charisma or who knows things.
01:08:56 One day I'll make the leap, once I'm ready.
01:08:59 You know, once I've warmed up myself a little bit.
01:09:01 He's tried being a poketuber.
01:09:03 It has not penned out.
01:09:04 It's time to try new things.
01:09:05 It's time to move on.
01:09:06 After I've warmed up with all this, with all this drawing bullshit.
01:09:10 Indeed.
01:09:11 Going into the real shit.
01:09:12 Yeah.
01:09:13 What profession would you not like to do?
01:09:16 God, like any of them.
01:09:19 So many.
01:09:20 Yeah.
01:09:21 That's a pretty broad question.
01:09:22 Is there any in particular that seems super odious?
01:09:25 Or is it just the office atmosphere, perhaps?
01:09:29 Yeah, just the office atmosphere.
01:09:32 Just anything that involves show up at a place and spend most of your time there.
01:09:40 Yeah.
01:09:41 Yeah.
01:09:42 It's bad.
01:09:43 Or, I mean, I would say manual labor.
01:09:50 Not because I think it would be worse than that.
01:09:52 I just think I would be really bad at it.
01:09:55 Sure.
01:09:56 Which would put a damper on things.
01:09:58 Yeah.
01:09:59 Alright.
01:10:00 And our final question.
01:10:01 If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?
01:10:12 I would like to hear.
01:10:17 Damn, Ben, you really knocked them dead.
01:10:20 They'll be talking about you forever.
01:10:24 And we're glad to have you.
01:10:27 We're all excited to meet you and we've got a lot to talk about.
01:10:30 So both confirmation that you have, in fact, made good use of your life.
01:10:36 Yeah.
01:10:37 And that things the party will continue forever up here.
01:10:40 Yes.
01:10:41 Where we praise what you've done.
01:10:42 Oh my God, yes.
01:10:45 Perfect.
01:10:46 That's the dream.
01:10:47 That's the dream.
01:10:48 Well, thank you.
01:10:49 Thank you for answering these questions.
01:10:50 We appreciate you leaching, you know, life force from us by being on our stage.
01:10:56 Yeah.
01:10:57 Kindly.
01:10:58 Get the fuck off my stage.
01:11:00 I will be, my lawyers will be in touch.
01:11:04 And so watch yourselves.
01:11:06 Thank you.
01:11:07 Watch yourself.
01:11:08 Goodbye.
01:11:09 Goodbye.
01:11:10 And now, ladies and gentlemen, to welcome our final guest of the evening.
01:11:15 Tonight on Inside the PCP Studio.
01:11:18 Please welcome to the stage.
01:11:20 Mr. Nate Bestman.
01:11:22 Best guy ever.
01:11:24 Yes.
01:11:25 Hello.
01:11:26 It is me.
01:11:27 I am the best guy ever.
01:11:30 A pleasure to be here.
01:11:33 Rad Dude.
01:11:34 Rude Dude.
01:11:36 Philosopher God King.
01:11:38 PCP Puppet Master.
01:11:42 As long in the dong as he is dank in the schlong.
01:11:46 Thank you for joining us, Mr. Bestman.
01:11:48 And let's get right down to it.
01:11:51 What is your favorite word?
01:11:55 My favorite word I have known for centuries, decades.
01:12:01 It is the word sass.
01:12:04 It is the word sass, everyone, because if you think about it.
01:12:08 Sass has the highest ratio of the letter s to its length of any word in the world.
01:12:15 That is my actual reasoning.
01:12:17 It sounds the best to say.
01:12:19 It is mathematically precise, 75% s.
01:12:23 That's unbeatable.
01:12:25 Therefore, it is my favorite word, get fucked.
01:12:30 Superlative.
01:12:32 What is your least favorite word?
01:12:36 My least favorite word.
01:12:40 Oh God, I don't know.
01:12:42 Maybe something like...
01:12:47 Something like...
01:12:49 Oh God, I don't fucking know.
01:12:51 Shit.
01:12:54 Crusty?
01:12:55 Crusty is a shitty word.
01:12:57 Yeah, that brings a lot of negative stuff to mind.
01:13:00 I think yeah, crusty.
01:13:02 Crusty is up there.
01:13:03 Yeah, that will do.
01:13:05 Unbelievable.
01:13:07 Mr. Bestman, what turns you on?
01:13:12 Well, as you recall from the fetish cast, I love me a nice pair of glasses.
01:13:20 I truly do, I truly do.
01:13:22 Other than that, what gets my engine revving is seeing people self-actualize.
01:13:30 Watching people achieve their dreams through their own initiative.
01:13:36 In a sense, this is probably a narcissistic thing.
01:13:41 It's not narcissistic, really, but I like it when I do that.
01:13:46 And I also like it when other people do that.
01:13:49 Hey, to give myself credit, I think that I did it because I admired it
01:13:53 and other people so much that eventually I was like, yeah, I want to do that too.
01:13:56 And so here I am, a bit of a self-starter in my life at this point.
01:14:00 So yeah, seeing people take control of their lives and pull themselves out of hell
01:14:07 or seize opportunities, even ones that people didn't think that were there.
01:14:12 Seeing them rise to the occasion, yeah, that really fires me up.
01:14:17 It really does.
01:14:19 Incredible.
01:14:21 What turns you off?
01:14:23 Oh, definitely entitlement or laziness are the ultimate disgusting things.
01:14:33 Really leeches in general.
01:14:36 If I see someone whose whole thing in life is that they depend on someone else to keep them afloat,
01:14:44 oh no, oh no, I cannot be having this.
01:14:47 I refuse to live my life in servitude to anyone or anyone else that I don't...
01:14:56 Even if I want to support someone, if I do that and it's draining my time and energy,
01:15:04 that means I can't go out and achieve the things I want to do.
01:15:07 So yeah, that's not for me.
01:15:10 People that are drains on time and energy and that do not contribute at least as much as they draw from the world around them.
01:15:19 Gross, can't have it.
01:15:22 Oh, sugoi!
01:15:24 What is your favorite curse word?
01:15:27 Well, I really like fuck.
01:15:30 Fuck is really good.
01:15:32 Though I've always had a soft spot.
01:15:34 My brother and I read this book series back in the day, he read it.
01:15:39 He's the one who turned me on to it, called The Wheel of Time series.
01:15:43 It's a fantasy series.
01:15:45 Robert Jordan?
01:15:46 Was that the Red Bull guy?
01:15:47 No, I don't know.
01:15:48 By some guy.
01:15:49 And maybe it was Robert Jordan.
01:15:51 Brian Jocks is the Red Bull guy.
01:15:54 Okay, but regardless, there was a phrase uttered by the character of Matt at one point in those books called,
01:16:00 or rather was, bloody buttered onions.
01:16:04 And I've always liked that a lot.
01:16:07 I thought that was real quirky.
01:16:09 Like me, a gamer girl.
01:16:12 But really, it's fuck.
01:16:13 Like I use fuck all the time.
01:16:14 It's great and I'm a big into it.
01:16:18 Transcendent.
01:16:20 What sound or noise do you love?
01:16:25 I am a big guy into ASMR.
01:16:29 So I really just like ASMR in general.
01:16:32 So I'm always listening to tons of pleasant sounds.
01:16:35 But hey, I can tell you, there's some evidence that things have narrowed down to what I really like the most.
01:16:41 I like the voice of people telling stories.
01:16:44 And I mean, I listen to men do it more because listening to women whisper in my ear is too sexual.
01:16:52 And it makes me get loboner.
01:16:55 And that is distracting when I'm trying to relax.
01:16:57 I got to take care of that.
01:16:59 So listening to men's soft voices tell stories is very, very nice.
01:17:06 I kind of like listening to guys talk about, kind of like just like, I don't know,
01:17:14 not like the kind of shitty empowerment stuff about how you're beautiful no matter what they say,
01:17:19 that kind of weak ass shit.
01:17:21 But I like hearing them say like, yeah, go out and seize the day.
01:17:24 I don't know, man, maybe I'm a weirdo.
01:17:26 But I like hearing like male voices whisper to me about like, go, you like put in your fucking work every day.
01:17:33 Basically, I like the whispering equivalent of that song.
01:17:36 That's like 10% luck, 10% skill, 18% positive concentrated power of will.
01:17:42 You know, that song that in whisper form is what I fucking like.
01:17:47 Also tapping sounds.
01:17:49 Truly shameful.
01:17:52 What sound or noise do you hate?
01:17:55 What sound or noise do I hate?
01:17:57 I don't know, like I kind of have encountered a lot of gross mouth sounds.
01:18:02 I really am not into, but I don't know, sometimes I can kind of tolerate them.
01:18:06 Sounds that I, hey, you know, you know what's one?
01:18:09 Okay, I got the perfect answer for this.
01:18:11 It's when I was a kid, I discovered something that like really was a pain trigger for me.
01:18:17 So you know the whole nails on the chalkboard thing?
01:18:19 Okay, that's like a meme one.
01:18:21 It's so much worse, at least to me.
01:18:23 It's the sound of, okay, no one's going to be able to understand this,
01:18:26 but just ride with me on this gravy train, if you will.
01:18:29 So the sound of a very dry hand rubbing on a cloth binder surface.
01:18:37 It's just a, it's very shh, shh.
01:18:41 The only word I can use to describe the sound is dry.
01:18:44 It is the sound of dryness.
01:18:46 And when I hear that sound, I can feel, it's like I'm being drained by crocodile in one piece.
01:18:51 To use an example that everyone understands.
01:18:54 But like I feel the essence of dryness, like murdering my body, especially my hands.
01:18:59 My hands feel dry when I hear that sound and it causes me physical discomfort.
01:19:04 So yeah, that one.
01:19:07 Very kawaii.
01:19:10 What profession, other than your own, would you like to attempt?
01:19:15 Well, I would like to be, I mean, I'm kind of transitioning,
01:19:20 I'm working on transitioning careers, like do YouTube full time.
01:19:23 It's funny, because like right now, I am a professional programmer.
01:19:26 What I would like to be is like an uncoverer of the secrets of the world.
01:19:31 Like one who expands the knowledge of humanity in some way.
01:19:35 So either like, I don't know, a physicist, an astrologist?
01:19:40 No, an astronomer, an astrophysicist.
01:19:43 Yeah, I think that's what I'm looking for.
01:19:45 Really just like a scientist of some kind.
01:19:48 I would love to just like, I'm almost any field,
01:19:51 but I gotta say I have a soft spot for like space travel and stuff, you know.
01:19:55 Starfleet, weird utilitarianism, whatever.
01:19:58 Like I'd love to like work with Elon Musk and like work on turning humanity
01:20:03 into a space faring civilization by like developing new technology
01:20:07 and like uncovering like physical secrets that we don't know right now
01:20:10 and developing stuff that'll let us do that.
01:20:13 That's what I'd love to do.
01:20:15 Yeah, sign me up Elon, I'm ready to go.
01:20:18 Oh, how deliciously absurd.
01:20:21 What profession would you not like to do?
01:20:24 Um, waste management?
01:20:27 You know, anything gross?
01:20:29 Oh, anything dealing with like bugs would be absolutely repulsive to me.
01:20:33 Also working at a pound where they have to put down animals would not be nice.
01:20:39 Like I would love to work around like dogs because I'm a big dog.
01:20:43 I fucking love dogs.
01:20:44 I want to hang out with them all the time.
01:20:46 But yeah, like that is like, I know that's a necessary thing,
01:20:53 but it is something that, you know, repulses me greatly.
01:20:57 Yeah, something like that, something like that.
01:20:59 Even though I'm not kink shaming people who work at the pound who have to do that shit.
01:21:04 I know it's necessary, but it always kind of makes me depressed.
01:21:08 Oh, good one.
01:21:10 And final question, Mr. Best Guy Ever.
01:21:13 If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?
01:21:19 Now this is the one question that I actually did prepare for,
01:21:23 and I know exactly what I'm going to say.
01:21:26 If I die and I go up to heaven and I see God at the pearly gates,
01:21:30 here are the two words I want him to say to my face.
01:21:34 I apologize.
01:21:38 That's not actually a joke.
01:21:41 Yeah, as everyone knows, I'm a big atheist.
01:21:44 I think there's no good reason to believe that God is real.
01:21:47 And if he was, in fact, real, if I died and he was there,
01:21:50 and like it is like the God that this question implies it is,
01:21:53 like the weirdo Christian God, you know, in heaven and shit,
01:21:56 I'd be like, excuse me, sir, aren't you supposed to be omnipotent?
01:21:59 There are like a billion people down there suffering in horrible ways,
01:22:02 and you created them, so their suffering is literally your fault.
01:22:05 I don't want to hear this cop out about free will because you control everything,
01:22:09 so get fucked.
01:22:11 I would have strong words for the guy,
01:22:14 but really no matter what the strength of his apology,
01:22:18 it will absolutely not be good enough for the terrible things that he's done.
01:22:24 Yeah, I don't buy that this free will shit that I literally do not even think human beings have.
01:22:30 I also don't believe in free will, by the way.
01:22:32 Maybe you've heard about it, weird utilitarianism.
01:22:34 Yeah, so he can get fucked.
01:22:36 Free will is an illusion, it's not real.
01:22:38 Yeah, fuck you, God.
01:22:42 Enlightening as always.
01:22:45 Now, thank you, Mr. Best Guy, please get the fuck off my stage.
01:22:51 Yes, thank you, goodbye.
01:22:54 That concludes the festivities for the evening.
01:22:58 I would like to thank all our guests who came to join us inside the PCP studio today.
01:23:04 We will see you soon with another epic meme.
01:23:08 Good night, everyone.
01:23:28 I'm not working.
01:23:30 I'm doing nothing.
01:23:32 My dick, I'm jerking.
01:23:35 Myself, I'm sucking.
01:23:38 I am an asshole.
01:23:40 I am a stupid.
01:23:43 I've got a deadline.
01:23:46 Don't want to do it.
