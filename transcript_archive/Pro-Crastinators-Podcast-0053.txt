00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:18 I'm the best guy ever, and we're all here for you.
00:00:23 I love Bane, and I love memes.
00:00:24 Hippocrit is here.
00:00:26 I'm English, and I got fucking yellow taste, nigga.
00:00:32 Digibro is here, finally, after such a long time.
00:00:36 I really thought that I was going to be the person on here with the worst hygiene, and
00:00:41 then Ben Saint showed up.
00:00:42 There it is, Ben, there it is.
00:00:46 I'm going to, yeah, no need to introduce me, Nate, I'm Ben Saint.
00:00:50 Oh yeah, your smell, your smell preceded you.
00:00:52 I'm Ben Saint.
00:00:53 I'm out of time.
00:00:54 I am here to dispel any and all rumors to the effect that my hygiene is anything less
00:00:59 than impeccable.
00:01:01 We're looking forward to that court case being settled down, okay.
00:01:04 Good luck.
00:01:05 The Davoo.
00:01:06 The Davoo is present.
00:01:07 Hashtag sockless foot lives matter.
00:01:10 Jesse would not agree, and Munchy wears tiny hats, that's all I need to know about him.
00:01:17 What?
00:01:18 No!
00:01:19 Oh my god!
00:01:20 No!
00:01:21 Not the piss!
00:01:22 Instantly!
00:01:23 Press one for Munchy's piss!
00:01:25 One, one, one, one!
00:01:26 He's running off of the stuff for us.
00:01:28 Hey yeah, he's doing number one.
00:01:30 Well, yeah.
00:01:31 That's right.
00:01:32 That's right.
00:01:33 Wow.
00:01:34 Real synergy there.
00:01:35 I'm honestly a little bit disappointed in myself.
00:01:36 That was not nearly enough.
00:01:37 It wasn't a powerful stream.
00:01:38 Yeah, it was kind of a normal piss as opposed to the like, the fucking intense, wildness.
00:01:43 My fucking kill myself.
00:01:45 If I can't pee good, why is it, what am I good for?
00:01:48 You've run this meme into the ground.
00:01:51 That's right, it's all right.
00:01:52 It's all right.
00:01:53 We're all desensitized to the sound of your piss so much that no one even got grossed out.
00:01:58 Let's help the audience.
00:01:59 Let's get some germics.
00:02:00 Brought to you, PCP.
00:02:01 Brought to you by Jermix.
00:02:02 Brought to you by Jermup.
00:02:03 You guys know the show Monk, the obsessive compulsive detective from the early 2000s?
00:02:09 Yeah, sure.
00:02:10 That show was sponsored by Clorox.
00:02:12 That was, was that really sponsored by Clorox?
00:02:13 Yeah, it was sponsored by Clorox, because fucking Monk always would like, use a wipe after,
00:02:17 before and after shaking anyone's hands.
00:02:19 So.
00:02:20 So much for journalistic integrity, am I right?
00:02:23 Okay.
00:02:24 So much for the tolerant left, am I right?
00:02:27 That's what I was trying to say.
00:02:28 That's what I was trying to say.
00:02:29 Yeah.
00:02:30 Anyway, we're talking about hygiene.
00:02:31 Hygiene.
00:02:32 So I went to Urban Dictionary.
00:02:33 Yeah.
00:02:34 I told the definition.
00:02:35 Hygiene.
00:02:36 Hygiene.
00:02:37 I have a friend named Gene.
00:02:38 This show is dedicated to him.
00:02:40 Urban Dictionary is the practice, to practice the art of cleanliness or to be clean.
00:02:46 So that's really boring.
00:02:47 What was that in Urban Dictionary words?
00:02:49 I don't know.
00:02:50 Just a normal dictionary word.
00:02:51 Wait, hang on.
00:02:52 That's the top definition?
00:02:53 Maybe there's a better one than the second.
00:02:55 The way that it's phrased is like a verb.
00:02:57 Okay, wait, I got it.
00:02:58 Okay.
00:02:59 Here's the second definition.
00:03:00 That's like the second most popular.
00:03:01 Hygiene.
00:03:02 The main factor in how close people are willing to stand next to you in any given situation.
00:03:06 That one I more agree with.
00:03:07 I wouldn't be surprised if a way to, to greet someone named Gene is probably on the list.
00:03:12 I would, let's see how far down that is.
00:03:14 I happen to know it.
00:03:15 I get that joke in, in a fucking X-Men movie and I really like that.
00:03:19 Really?
00:03:20 It's like one of the other ones.
00:03:21 Gene Gray, Gene Gray or something.
00:03:22 Yeah.
00:03:23 Hygiene.
00:03:24 I happen to know a quick and easy catchy guide to how to hygiene.
00:03:28 Okay.
00:03:29 It goes, you gotta wash your ass if you must, you gotta brush your hair if you must, you
00:03:34 gotta brush your teeth if you must or else you'll be funky.
00:03:39 Solid advice.
00:03:40 Solid advice.
00:03:41 But I like funky.
00:03:42 I, um, I, I also know a funky.
00:03:44 Here's a, here's a thing I hate about the general concept of, of anything related to hygiene
00:03:49 is that funky is considered gross when it is actually my favorite type of music.
00:03:53 So fuck everyone.
00:03:55 But, but the Beatles, neither the Beatles nor Led Zeppelin are funk guys.
00:03:59 Oh no, Led Zeppelin have some funky tunes.
00:04:01 You just gotta look.
00:04:02 I, I guess that's true.
00:04:03 I feel similarly hippo.
00:04:04 I mean, soupy balls is my favorite kind of music and it's always getting a bad rap.
00:04:09 By the way, I have, I have a second easy guide to remember the cleanliness thing.
00:04:14 And it was George Carlin's method, which is just never clean yourself ever.
00:04:18 Just don't worry about it.
00:04:19 The only things you have to clean daily are asshole armpits, something in teeth.
00:04:23 Fuck.
00:04:24 What is it?
00:04:25 Balls.
00:04:26 Gooch.
00:04:27 Balls and teeth.
00:04:28 Something like that.
00:04:29 Yeah.
00:04:30 It's close enough.
00:04:31 Asshole armpit, balls and teeth.
00:04:32 Balls and teeth.
00:04:33 Ah, no suck a little baby.
00:04:36 Well, so we at the PCP are all like foremost experts on the subject of hygiene.
00:04:42 Like if you were going to come to somebody for hygienic advice, we are definitely the
00:04:46 people you would come to.
00:04:48 So this is going to be the most informed, knowledgeable podcast in the world.
00:04:52 I thought it would be a bunch of blue pill, uh, libtard revolutionaries who are here
00:04:57 to change the game about hygiene standards and smash the hygiene patriarchy that's been
00:05:02 imposed on the world for so long and say, fuck that shit.
00:05:05 You don't need to be clean.
00:05:06 You just need to be a stink boy and embrace your odor and be, you know, as close to like
00:05:11 Ben as possible.
00:05:12 That's, you know, the-
00:05:13 I hate you, Nate.
00:05:14 I hate you.
00:05:15 I hate all of you.
00:05:16 You're all done.
00:05:17 You're all done.
00:05:18 Ben, I really wonder what you were expecting when you decided to come onto the hygiene.
00:05:22 I expected to be treated as a human being.
00:05:26 Before we get started here, I need to mention, uh, we record PCP every week and last week's
00:05:33 recording ever since we decided that it was going to be hygiene, I have elected to not
00:05:39 change my clothes or do any hygienic process whatsoever.
00:05:44 Gonzo Hygiene Journalism, all right.
00:05:48 And I have to say, um, dear God.
00:05:53 Uh, Munchy, that's- I'm real glad that we have time.
00:05:57 The only words that could come out.
00:05:59 The only analysis.
00:06:00 I'm so lucky.
00:06:01 We are real lucky to have a hardcore, deep-covered journalist like you out there in the field,
00:06:06 Munchy.
00:06:07 I'm getting the germs.
00:06:08 Well, that's right.
00:06:09 What has been the reaction of people to you during this time?
00:06:14 Any difference?
00:06:15 I've noticed anything?
00:06:16 Okay, okay, okay, okay.
00:06:18 It got kind of significant.
00:06:20 Like, after the first, like the second day, someone was like, you're wearing the same
00:06:24 shirt as yesterday.
00:06:25 I'm like, get used to it.
00:06:27 That sounds like a personal problem right, you shit.
00:06:33 And then after like the four or fifth day, people started noticing like the stink lines
00:06:37 coming off of me because I was in a loony town.
00:06:40 Right, right.
00:06:41 And then recently, it's just gone, like very quickly, I realized like, even the minimal
00:06:48 hiding that I put myself through, it's still, like, I changed my clothes.
00:06:53 That ended up self is huge.
00:06:55 But now, like, my pants might as well have been peed in.
00:07:00 Like, they might as well have been just completely soaked in pee.
00:07:03 They might as well have been.
00:07:05 The amounts of driblets that build up over a week are not to, are substantial.
00:07:09 My balls are literally like a beef stew.
00:07:12 Like they're literally like beef stew.
00:07:14 Oh my God, that visual.
00:07:18 Oh my God, it's even funnier because I know exactly what he's talking about because I've
00:07:24 been there.
00:07:25 So, like, I know, I know what it feels like to have swamp ass.
00:07:30 Hey guys, show of hands, what is like the, your lowest point in terms of hygiene?
00:07:34 What's the longest you've ever gone without a shower?
00:07:36 And what happened?
00:07:37 Well, I'm going to have to change, I'm going to use a different definition than longest
00:07:41 time without a shower.
00:07:43 The low point of hygiene for me, I mean, pretty much my entire teens, but, like, because
00:07:50 I showered pretty infrequently and I had really long, nappy, shitty hair that I didn't, I
00:07:56 would never brush.
00:07:57 So, like, basically what my hair would do is it would just keep getting worse and worse
00:08:02 until it became such a horrible forest of tangles that I'd have to have my dad sit down
00:08:09 for like an hour and untangle my hair.
00:08:12 Like, like, like great apes.
00:08:14 Yeah.
00:08:15 Or like that scene in the Princess Diaries where that guy snaps off a fucking brush in
00:08:19 the princess's hair and has to, he's like, you're broke my brush, why would you do that?
00:08:24 Hey, Ben, you're a great ape because I like you.
00:08:27 I thank you, I thank you and I love you.
00:08:31 The first time I let my hair get out of control, I was 12 and it got to a point where, because
00:08:37 my idea was I would make dreadlocks because then I'd never have to brush it again.
00:08:41 Good.
00:08:42 But making dreadlocks requires maintenance and effort and I put none of that in so it
00:08:46 just became a huge, like, fucking nest on my head.
00:08:49 And my grandma starts offering me $50 to get a haircut and I didn't take it because I wanted
00:08:55 her to give me $75 because there was, there was anime DVDs I wanted to buy so I decided
00:09:00 I would wait until she offered higher.
00:09:02 And then my dad came up to me and he said, look, I'll give you $100 to cut your hair
00:09:07 because you can't just bleed Mima out of all her fucking money because she was broke
00:09:11 at the time.
00:09:12 I was like, sick.
00:09:13 You're a bastard, Digi.
00:09:14 He said, he said I'll never do this again though.
00:09:19 So I got my haircut, I got $100 and then I grew my hair out again and I started, you
00:09:24 know, essentially letting the same thing happen but now I knew I wasn't going to get any money.
00:09:27 I just was lazy but my dad would just sit there and untangle my hair for like hours
00:09:32 every couple of months when it got to a point where it was just like too much for anyone
00:09:35 to bear.
00:09:36 Why didn't he just stealthily cut it?
00:09:37 Yeah, I was going to say.
00:09:38 There was one time he did have to cut out, like he had to because it was just impossible
00:09:44 and he had to just cut off like a huge amount of it.
00:09:47 But that's not even the worst in terms of like hygiene, like that's aesthetically awful
00:09:52 but the worst that I got in terms of hygiene was, do you guys, are you familiar with Andrew
00:09:56 W.K.?
00:09:57 I don't know.
00:09:58 I don't know.
00:09:59 Only with the name.
00:10:00 He's a musician and general personality.
00:10:04 You guys would probably know him for the fact that he did panels at Brony conventions because
00:10:08 of the fact that he became convinced he was a reincarnation of Pinkie Pie.
00:10:12 Oh yeah.
00:10:13 That's true.
00:10:14 Yes.
00:10:15 Because Andrew W.K. is obsessed with parties and his whole thing is that he just talks
00:10:18 about parties constantly and everything's a party and that's his life.
00:10:21 And so when Pinkie Pie came out then everyone was like, oh this is basically Andrew W.K.
00:10:24 When's the guy with that fucking album, the bloody face?
00:10:27 That's why there's the party hard shirt with Pinkie Pie bleeding out of her face which
00:10:30 is the cool shirt.
00:10:31 Oh right.
00:10:32 It all makes sense.
00:10:34 Andrew W.K. writes all these different weird articles and columns on different places and
00:10:38 he had this one thing, I think it was even a YouTube video, like an analytical style
00:10:43 YouTube video before those were even everywhere, about how you don't need to wash your hair
00:10:50 because he was explaining that your scalp produces natural oils which shampoo are just
00:10:57 washing out of it.
00:10:58 And so if you allow your hair to start perpetuating its own oils then it will eventually be even
00:11:05 healthier than if you were putting shampoo in it.
00:11:07 Right, I remember a cracked article saying that when you shower it removes what is called
00:11:12 the horny layer for some reason and the horny layer does something to your immune system
00:11:17 that's good because we evolved to be apes that don't fucking have hygiene or civilization
00:11:22 or more than two people in a room at the time.
00:11:24 It's incompatible, fuck the horny layer.
00:11:27 True, but we also evolved to be a species that dies at 30.
00:11:32 Yeah.
00:11:33 You know what I'm saying?
00:11:34 You know what I'm saying, bro?
00:11:36 Yeah.
00:11:37 So this article came out and there is some substance to it.
00:11:43 My brother Victor, he actually doesn't wash his hair anymore because everything that he
00:11:48 was using was just making it worse.
00:11:51 Every different kind of shampoo wasn't working and now that he has stopped his hair actually
00:11:55 has improved.
00:11:56 I tried to do this for probably a month and I have really, really bad dandruff and my
00:12:05 scalp became magma.
00:12:10 It got to a point.
00:12:13 There was no hard surface on the top of my head anymore.
00:12:16 It was all like a mushy layer.
00:12:20 The kill of the first flame.
00:12:21 I'm at that point right now, DJ.
00:12:23 You and me are fucking kindred.
00:12:25 You're dandruff boys, bro.
00:12:27 It's dandruff boys.
00:12:30 If I ran my hands through my hair, it would be like this mushy mashed potato-y surface
00:12:37 that would just have blood and shit in it.
00:12:40 Jesus Christ.
00:12:41 God damn it.
00:12:42 You already fucking usurped my entire lowest point story, which was I went two weeks without
00:12:46 showering in the summer and whenever I scratched my leg, there was this gray goo that scraped
00:12:51 off of it that I thought could take over the world.
00:12:53 I think I was just going to leave because I don't like this stuff.
00:12:56 It wasn't nearly as bad as what you were describing.
00:12:58 Gray goo is definitely how I describe what was coming off of my head as well as like,
00:13:02 I mean, my head, the thing is, if I go like three days without showering, my dandruff
00:13:07 gets bad enough that I start scratching it and I start bleeding from my scalp.
00:13:11 Fuck me.
00:13:12 I'm pretty used to blood coming out of my head.
00:13:15 What the fuck?
00:13:16 Even right now, if I scratch the back of my head, I can draw blood with relativism.
00:13:21 Did you come to get that looked into?
00:13:23 I don't know if that's normal.
00:13:24 Contrary to popular belief.
00:13:27 People always say, like people always talk about how like they joke that I never shower.
00:13:31 No, I actually shower.
00:13:32 I mean, I don't shower every single day, like what some people, what normies do.
00:13:37 But I do have to shower every couple of days to prevent my scalp from turning into a fucking
00:13:42 volcanic crater.
00:13:44 So yeah.
00:13:45 Yeah.
00:13:46 I mean, for me, it's like when my hair, when my hair gets long enough, like as my hair
00:13:50 was.
00:13:51 Is he done?
00:13:52 He's done.
00:13:53 He is.
00:13:54 Yeah, my hair was like six plus inches up until a couple of weeks ago, up until a month
00:13:56 ago.
00:13:57 And like when it's that long, if it's been 37 hours since my last shower, it's like I'm
00:14:02 fucking like planting my face into like the sweaty ass of an athlete.
00:14:05 On the subject, on the subject of hair, here's, here's my thing.
00:14:10 If I go more than like maybe four days without showering, my hair gets pretty greasy.
00:14:15 And the thing, the thing that always strikes me about that experience is if, is if I go
00:14:20 out for a cigarette and I light it up and I'm thinking about what if an ember came off
00:14:24 and just landed on my hair.
00:14:27 And I wonder, and I wonder if the grease on my hair is, is enough and is the right kind
00:14:31 that it would just go up in flames.
00:14:33 And sometimes I'm pretty tempted to just tap my hair with the end of the cigarette just,
00:14:38 just to see what would happen.
00:14:39 But I like, but I like, but I like, but every time thus far, every time thus far I've walked
00:14:45 myself back from that precipice.
00:14:46 I haven't jumped yet.
00:14:47 I haven't jumped yet.
00:14:49 You need to go full Lord of Cinder one of these days.
00:14:51 Did you, didn't you have someone light your hair on fire once in a while?
00:14:54 That would be, that would be the darkest timeline of the PCP is that one day my hair just goes
00:14:58 up and I'm just, and I look like that guy in the second, and I look like that guy in
00:15:02 the second season, and I look like that guy in the second half of Ghost in the Shell.
00:15:05 Yeah.
00:15:06 Oh right, that guy.
00:15:07 With a messed up face.
00:15:08 Two face.
00:15:09 One of us needs to link the flame, Ben, and I, I nominate you.
00:15:12 Thanks, man.
00:15:14 The most ripe.
00:15:15 By the way, Ben, you and I, when we were young lads, we both had very long hair.
00:15:19 Yes.
00:15:20 Just in contrast to Jesse.
00:15:21 And as I remember-
00:15:22 I feel like I was pretty good about washing it though.
00:15:24 Yeah.
00:15:25 I think we both were.
00:15:26 And I remember spending a lot of time brushing it.
00:15:28 Ben and I both had hair roughly down to our waist in like high school just for various
00:15:32 reasons.
00:15:33 Wow.
00:15:34 And I remember wanting to, I specifically was motivated by a depiction of one character
00:15:38 from the Wheel of Time series, which you might be familiar with.
00:15:41 The Rans like soldier guys, right?
00:15:44 It was one of the Rans like top dudes.
00:15:47 The ones that have the braids.
00:15:48 I forget.
00:15:49 Yeah, there was like some group of men who had long braids and they tied silver bells
00:15:53 to them.
00:15:54 And I always thought that was the coolest shit, but I wanted to do that, never got around
00:15:57 to it.
00:15:58 But it stuck in my mind to this day.
00:15:59 Maybe, maybe one day.
00:16:01 Wait, wait.
00:16:02 No.
00:16:03 It wasn't his organization that had the braids.
00:16:04 It was some, one of the guys-
00:16:05 It was like some ethnicity.
00:16:06 One of the guys was just from some country where they did that.
00:16:08 Yeah, that's right.
00:16:09 Guys, can we, can we just as an aside talk about how great it is having short hair as
00:16:16 opposed to-
00:16:17 So much better.
00:16:18 Down to the ass hair.
00:16:19 I've decided I'm growing my hair a little long, not like crazy long, not down to my
00:16:22 waist long, but I'm going to let it, I'm going to let it get chaggy again.
00:16:26 Down to like, you know, the maybe shoulders in the back is fine.
00:16:31 But like-
00:16:32 Yeah.
00:16:33 God, having long hair is just such a fucking pain in the ass.
00:16:35 Yeah, it's a nightmare.
00:16:36 It's a nightmare.
00:16:37 But first of all, clogs your shower all the time.
00:16:40 Yeah.
00:16:41 Like every time I would have, any time I, a lot of the times when I cut my hair, it's
00:16:45 because my drain has started to get clogged and I go, well, that's a sign that it's time,
00:16:49 you know.
00:16:50 Yep.
00:16:51 You have to start using conditioner so it costs extra, you know, because if you get out
00:16:55 of the shower after just shampoo, your hair becomes a fucking brick.
00:16:58 Yeah, it is an essential thing to have conditioner when you have long hair for sure.
00:17:02 If it gets past a certain point, you got to brush it every day or several times a day.
00:17:07 My friend, I had a friend named Mike, who fucking would brush, he had like hair past
00:17:12 his shoulders.
00:17:13 It was just the kind of hair that doesn't grow super long, even though he'd been growing
00:17:16 it for like five years.
00:17:17 Yeah, sure.
00:17:18 But he would brush his hair constantly.
00:17:21 Like he had a brush on him at all times and he would just like, whatever he was sitting
00:17:26 around, he'd just start brushing at his hair, like maintaining it, making sure it's perfect.
00:17:30 Did you guys ever read stories about like old, old like lords and ladies of olden times?
00:17:34 Yeah.
00:17:35 No, I'm talking about like medieval stuff.
00:17:36 There's always this image of giving your hair a hundred brush strokes every day.
00:17:40 Like Nineve from the Wheel of Time would do that shit with a very long brown hair every
00:17:45 day.
00:17:46 Were you just like on a Wheel of Time?
00:17:47 Yeah.
00:17:48 The Wheel of Time, like the real historical account of lords and ladies.
00:17:55 Well, I'm willing to be credulous of the fact that old women used to, you know, women in
00:18:01 olden times brush their hair a hundred times.
00:18:02 That specific phrase I think is a Japanese thing though, the 100 strokes per day.
00:18:07 Yeah.
00:18:08 Well, this one was, you know, with a bunch of people.
00:18:09 I just thought Sephiroth was really cool.
00:18:12 Yeah, of course.
00:18:13 You were right.
00:18:14 Oh my God.
00:18:15 You were right.
00:18:16 Bindi Sephiroth, if Sephiroth was real.
00:18:17 I spent a lot of time thinking about dyeing my hair silver, but I never did.
00:18:21 Dyeing your hair silver?
00:18:22 Dyeing your hair silver?
00:18:23 Yeah.
00:18:24 On the subject of having short hair.
00:18:25 Yeah.
00:18:26 So did I, dude.
00:18:27 So did I.
00:18:28 On the subject of having short hair.
00:18:29 The hair I'm at right now is like, you know how like humans, like the one second at the
00:18:34 end of the immortal clock and the dinosaurs were at noon or whatever.
00:18:39 Like me having short hair and the length I'm at right now is that is like the one second
00:18:43 before midnight and like the bombs go off and in my log in my locker.
00:18:47 What does that mean?
00:18:48 What does that mean?
00:18:49 It means he needs a haircut in like a week, which is what he's trying to say.
00:18:52 I see.
00:18:53 I have, I have needed a haircut immediately for like years at a time.
00:18:59 I for my entire life, like up until like maybe like a year ago.
00:19:04 I have had the most flowing of mains you shall ever see.
00:19:08 Even more main full than Davos.
00:19:10 Even more main for you see, not only was my hair long, but it was like a curly sort
00:19:16 of like jungle, like like like bonsai, like I'm like going to napalm myself.
00:19:21 What was the actual length because I want to know.
00:19:25 The actual length was down to like like like below my shoulder blades and like above kind
00:19:30 of.
00:19:31 So I'm the person who's had the short, I'm someone who's had a reputation of having
00:19:33 this, you know, big hair for being not female, allegedly.
00:19:37 But I actually have had the shortest, I have had the shortest hair record of anyone in
00:19:41 this call.
00:19:42 It's not that your hair is, it's not that your hair is long.
00:19:45 It's that it is specifically big, that it flows outward as opposed to down and that's
00:19:49 what they would give.
00:19:50 That's kind of a majestic quality to me.
00:19:52 I wasn't fucking done anyway.
00:19:54 Up until recently, I've had, I've had like like long hair and it's been fucking awful
00:19:59 as did you could attest to now, now.
00:20:01 I've had mag, like I think I've specifically like intentionally inflicted myself with magma
00:20:08 brains.
00:20:10 What does that mean?
00:20:11 Okay.
00:20:12 Did you use like weird like volcano brain?
00:20:13 Oh, oh that.
00:20:14 Okay.
00:20:15 Okay.
00:20:16 Okay.
00:20:17 So it went like this.
00:20:18 I've had bad dandruff because I would just, like I just wouldn't shout when I was a little
00:20:21 baby boy, which I still am when I was a little, when I was a lesser baby boy, I just wouldn't
00:20:25 shower because it was, I thought it was fucking gay.
00:20:28 And so.
00:20:29 It is, right.
00:20:30 I, I would have a ton of dandruff.
00:20:32 And so I've, like, like it was hard for me to like brush my hair because it was so curly.
00:20:37 Like I just, I just couldn't do it.
00:20:39 So I, I came up with a system where I would, you know, look at on combs, on the little
00:20:45 like points on the, on each points, there is sort of like a rounded sort of nub to,
00:20:50 to make it easier on your scalp.
00:20:52 So one day I cut off all of the nubs.
00:20:56 So it was a hard, rigid surface.
00:20:58 And then when I scraped my scalp, the dandruff would come off and leave a sort of resin,
00:21:03 like a gray sort of like goopy, disgusting, bloody mess on the end of the comb.
00:21:08 I know that feel, dude.
00:21:10 I know, I know about the gray goo.
00:21:12 I know about like dead skin coming off and kind of like, in like rolls a little bit.
00:21:16 But I've never, it's never been bloody.
00:21:18 It's never been bloody in my experience.
00:21:20 Are you ever concerned that if you just pushed on that gray mush too hard, you'd get white
00:21:25 to your brain?
00:21:26 Yes, yes.
00:21:27 Yes.
00:21:28 Sometimes, sometimes I do it, like sometimes I'm bad to do it, like, I'm just like, I
00:21:32 just want to reach and I just want, I just want to feel it, I just want to feel it.
00:21:34 I just want to feel my brain.
00:21:35 Wait guys, is this, is this that thing where like, you know, you know how if you rub the
00:21:40 bottom of your foot, like the cells kind of ball up and the dead skin, you can just,
00:21:45 you can just rub your hands together.
00:21:48 You can just rub your hands together right now and you'll get a little bit of like gray
00:21:51 goo.
00:21:52 I'm doing it, I'm doing it.
00:21:53 Not that much because I just showered because I'm a clean boy, goddammit.
00:21:56 I've been denied fruits of god for a week.
00:22:02 What are you talking about?
00:22:04 Oh, oh right, changing, being clean.
00:22:06 The shower he's probably going to take immediately after this.
00:22:10 Exactly.
00:22:11 I am.
00:22:12 No, we want to hear from you again.
00:22:14 Okay.
00:22:15 Report in.
00:22:16 Right, I wasn't listening to most of that because it was gross and I fucking hate it.
00:22:19 You're the big beard boy, so we want to know about that situation.
00:22:22 Well, first I want to say that my hair was like DeVoo until like I decided to let it
00:22:29 keep growing and then it became heavy enough to pull it down and now if I shaved it off,
00:22:33 I'm not sure that it would grow back like outwards, like big, like an afro, like it
00:22:38 used to be when I was younger.
00:22:40 Yeah.
00:22:41 Yeah, when my hair gets passed like five inches, it becomes heavy enough to start being
00:22:46 pulled down, so then it just looks like a weird like upside down W. It looks like the
00:22:49 McDonald's symbol.
00:22:50 It looks terrible.
00:22:51 Yeah, so the longest my hair has been is actually in my give and take reviews.
00:22:58 It hasn't been before that that I had long hair.
00:23:00 I just sort of suddenly decided to have it and then based my whole YouTube icon iconography
00:23:07 around it and I'm scared to like change that at this point.
00:23:11 I don't know whether, but I have had like, like passing dreams of like, like not passing
00:23:16 dreams, but like fantasies of like, like just shaving it entirely off and then starting
00:23:21 fresh, being able to be bald for like a week.
00:23:24 In his flights of fancy, a give and dreams of being a bald boy for, for, I do too.
00:23:30 I was just going to say I want to see give and bald, but I feel like I have also thought
00:23:35 about shaving off my entire head like very frequently, but I feel like if I do that,
00:23:39 then my, the top part of my scalp would just melt down and I'll just become like a soup
00:23:43 head.
00:23:44 I'll be a soup head boy.
00:23:45 I suspect that give and bald will look like, uh, like a Walter White.
00:23:51 Like yeah.
00:23:52 Yeah.
00:23:53 I see that.
00:23:54 Oh my God.
00:23:55 Yeah.
00:23:56 Just be careful.
00:23:57 Be careful how old you are when you do it.
00:23:58 I remember when a Stephen Colbert went to like the military for, to do shows there for
00:24:00 a week and he got his head shaved and it never grew back as full.
00:24:04 Yeah.
00:24:05 And that was sad.
00:24:06 That's why I, uh, that's why I keep growing mine out because even though I don't like
00:24:11 having, like having long hair, I want to savor all the time that I can because a big part
00:24:18 of why I kept my hair long is that my parents encouraged it growing up because my mom thinks
00:24:22 long hair is cool.
00:24:23 And my dad was jealous because he started balding in like his late 20s, so he hasn't
00:24:27 had a long, he just can't grow it.
00:24:30 See what he was doing was he was raising three crops with, for which to harvest hair when
00:24:34 the time was right.
00:24:35 Right.
00:24:36 Yeah.
00:24:37 My dad is bald and I'm probably going to go bald as well.
00:24:39 I've actually started going bald a little bit at the top, like the forehead and it's
00:24:44 annoying me.
00:24:45 Oh really?
00:24:46 It's annoying.
00:24:47 I have, I have fucking hair privileges.
00:24:48 All my uncles, like, like my hair descends from my mom's side and all the guys on my
00:24:51 mom's side have full heads of hair, no matter how old.
00:24:54 My grandpa is like in his mid 80s and his hair is becoming really thin through sheer
00:24:58 force of old, but it's still like he doesn't have any bald spots.
00:25:01 I'm like, yeah.
00:25:02 Fuck it.
00:25:03 No guys.
00:25:04 Okay.
00:25:05 Go on.
00:25:06 Go on.
00:25:07 Uh, but yeah, you're talking about beards.
00:25:08 Yeah.
00:25:10 My, I think I have the largest, maybe aside from Ben, the largest beard growing capabilities
00:25:16 in this case.
00:25:17 My beard doesn't really get like big.
00:25:19 Like when I grew it long in like 2013 or 2014, it just kind of like, it just kind of grew
00:25:24 down and it would just kind of like, it would, I could just kind of like push it up against
00:25:28 my neck and it would just stay there.
00:25:30 Like it didn't get, it didn't get like big.
00:25:32 It got, I don't know.
00:25:33 Has your beard gotten bigger?
00:25:34 There was like a happy medium of length there.
00:25:36 Mine was at its biggest like a year and a half ago when I had that super long beard.
00:25:40 When you had that super, yeah, I don't think, I don't think it's been ever that big.
00:25:44 I think I've gotten close, but I shaved it away.
00:25:47 And recently I, you know, I shaved the bottom part of it and I had the mustache thing going.
00:25:53 One of my favorite things about give, well, it's just like, I really love that picture
00:25:58 that Jade Maraud drew of, you know, the one of you in the Ryuko costume with like the
00:26:01 hair goes all the way around as one like perfect circle of hair that has no separation
00:26:05 between like a beard and, you know, hair at the top of your head.
00:26:09 I really, really like that.
00:26:10 Which one was that?
00:26:11 The way you described it was strange.
00:26:13 It was, it was the one with, it was posted with the DigiSnow picture.
00:26:16 It was that and then you and the Ryuko cosplay.
00:26:18 And then it's just your beard and hair were depicted so, so, main like in that.
00:26:24 Yeah, unified.
00:26:25 So Nate, have you, have you ever experimented with facial hair?
00:26:28 Yeah, I can't grow it, dude.
00:26:30 I can't do it.
00:26:31 I've tried.
00:26:32 I mean, but by tried, I mean I just not shaved.
00:26:35 Yeah, we don't need to do this too much.
00:26:37 I want to talk about the hygiene of a beard.
00:26:39 Right, that's what I meant.
00:26:40 Right, right.
00:26:41 When my beard got super long, it was definitely a hygienic nightmare because, A, everything
00:26:46 I ate got in my beard.
00:26:48 Like everything.
00:26:49 And it just so happened that I was starting to go through a soup phase at the time.
00:26:53 So I would like, you know, like a little droplet of soup falls off of my spoon and it just
00:26:58 goes all the way trailing through the beard.
00:27:00 I'm just imagining you taking a spoon to Munchie's head, eating that soup.
00:27:03 Yeah!
00:27:04 You know?
00:27:05 Just die.
00:27:06 Just die.
00:27:07 Stop it.
00:27:08 I won't, I am, I will, no way will anyone get me to edit this particular episode.
00:27:13 I would kill them.
00:27:15 Even right now.
00:27:16 I'm on it.
00:27:17 I'm on it, hippo.
00:27:18 I'm on the cake.
00:27:19 All right, good.
00:27:20 Please, please.
00:27:21 Take this one.
00:27:22 Even right now my beard is long enough that like everything I eat, I have to have a napkin
00:27:24 with me because like I constantly, I feel weird with anything's on my face or hands.
00:27:29 I have to like constantly wipe stuff down, so I always have to have stuff on me.
00:27:33 And there was a point, when it was at the super long point, there was a time where, like,
00:27:37 I would legit just find shit in my beard.
00:27:39 Like, like twigs and stuff, like, I'd just be stroking my beard and there'd be like
00:27:44 a piece of tree that had fallen off when I was outside smoking or something, you know?
00:27:49 I do want to say like, shaving the chin only is, that's the main bit.
00:27:55 If you get rid of the chin, then nothing really falls into a beard.
00:27:58 If you just trim your mustache like it's so that it's like straight, then it's fine.
00:28:03 Like, when I had that, it was really good.
00:28:05 I've never had like a big beard before, as I am a greater baby, however I slam a baby.
00:28:12 Right.
00:28:13 A greater baby.
00:28:14 I love that.
00:28:15 No, he's a dire baby.
00:28:18 Yeah.
00:28:19 I even started to shave my beard recently and I wanted to get it back.
00:28:27 However, even when I've had, like, at the height of my baby beard, I still, like, just
00:28:34 ever, ever so slightly, just the whisk, just a small, tiny little layer, I could feel,
00:28:42 I could feel the soup seeking out.
00:28:44 I could feel it.
00:28:45 I'll tell you right now, my beard drifts as bad as my head drifts and bleeds even
00:28:52 faster.
00:28:53 Oh, God.
00:28:54 Like, get this yourself.
00:28:55 I get some head dandruff if I go a while without sharing.
00:28:58 I don't, I don't get beard rift.
00:28:59 By the way, let me just say that I'm sitting right next to a full wall mirror and just seeing
00:29:04 the majesty that is my beard.
00:29:06 I look so fucking great.
00:29:07 I look so fucking great with a beard.
00:29:09 I agree.
00:29:10 I agree.
00:29:11 I can see it.
00:29:12 Ben, when I found out that you shaved it after Bronicon, I literally, like, sent you,
00:29:15 like, a few messages saying that I was legitimately mad at you, if you remember correctly.
00:29:18 Yeah.
00:29:19 Well, I have an interesting-
00:29:20 The funny thing is that Ben has spent the last six months trying to grow it back out,
00:29:23 but he habitually picks-
00:29:25 Yeah.
00:29:26 This is-
00:29:27 Yeah, this is the thing.
00:29:28 I'm kind of embarrassed about it, but I was gonna mention it, is, yeah.
00:29:31 The whole time, I was like, I look so, I can't, I think, I don't know.
00:29:36 My face is not the worst, but it's not the best ever, either, in my opinion.
00:29:40 So the whole time, I didn't have a beard.
00:29:42 I was like, man, I wish I had the beard back, but yeah.
00:29:44 I have a nervous fucking thing where I will, like, pick my hair out and I would just pick
00:29:48 too hard and just make, like, a fucking hole in my beard, and then I would have to, I would
00:29:53 be like, I fucked it, and I would shave it and start again, and it took me months, it
00:29:57 took me months to fucking get that, to just hold off on that long enough for the beard
00:30:01 to take shape enough that I could have a little bit of leeway, and now if I pick a hair out
00:30:06 or two, like, it doesn't matter and you can't see it, um, but I'm back.
00:30:10 It's fucking back, baby.
00:30:11 Yeah!
00:30:12 Tea back!
00:30:13 Hashtag, max for five, tea back!
00:30:16 Yes, yes.
00:30:17 Uh, I didn't really get to talk about my general showering and stuff.
00:30:21 There have been times when I have not showered because, you know, even though I hate this,
00:30:28 the stank, I can't ever smell my own, so, you know, it takes a long time for me to notice.
00:30:32 I-
00:30:33 Even though I know it's there, and I can't smell it, I just, like, have it.
00:30:37 I, well, here's, I can smell my own, but the thing is that I don't mind it, and sometimes
00:30:42 I kind of like it, so I'm a monster.
00:30:45 Ben, no, okay.
00:30:46 I definitely mind my own.
00:30:48 BenSaint is definitely, if you know Ben in person, you will know his scent.
00:30:53 Fuck you, buddy.
00:30:54 Hey, you know what, guys?
00:30:55 Ben, it's the primary weapon of a homeless warrior, like, Ben, what else can you do?
00:30:59 We can't not bring this up, because your scent is so specific in particular, and it's
00:31:05 because your whole room, like, it gets to a point where when you open the door to Ben's
00:31:10 room, it just kind of, like, billows out onto you, like, you immediately are hit with his
00:31:14 nose.
00:31:15 We have to talk about Ben's peanut shells.
00:31:16 We have to talk about Ben's peanut shells.
00:31:18 We can not fucking go to Pugas without being about Ben's peanut shells, we can.
00:31:23 Yeah, that's, that was, I had just really been enjoying some peanuts that week.
00:31:27 They were all over you like a cracker baler.
00:31:32 Well, they don't, they're not gonna, they're not gonna attract ants, they don't have sugar
00:31:38 in them, whatever.
00:31:39 I'll just, I'll sweep them up later.
00:31:42 You go, you go to a fancy country restaurant, a barbecue place, they have sawdust all over
00:31:46 the floor.
00:31:47 It's the same thing, same idea.
00:31:48 I'm dragging on Ben's hygiene, but it's not necessarily complaining, because I was actually
00:31:53 kind of excited when I, when Ben moved in and I realized that his hygiene was as bad
00:31:58 if that worked.
00:31:59 The standards are going so far down, you're in the career now.
00:32:01 He was like, it was exciting to know that my new roommate wasn't going to get on my
00:32:05 case about my hygiene, you know, that like, that we were kind of stank buddies together.
00:32:10 Yeah.
00:32:11 Oh my God, a new variant of the spicy bro pack, the stank buddies.
00:32:15 We have to fucking be stank buddies.
00:32:17 I want to be fair though, like, I mean, the first couple months it was like, everything
00:32:21 he did you was describing was true, but I feel like the last couple of months, it seemed
00:32:25 like Ben wasn't, seemed like he may have been taking showers more often, maybe because
00:32:28 we were, I was trying to not make fun of him about it, but then one time I said, he smells
00:32:32 like a 3D armpit, which I didn't think would be offensive, but that's, that's a really
00:32:35 terrible thing to say.
00:32:36 Whoa.
00:32:37 Here's, here's, here's what I'll say.
00:32:38 Here's, I just want to make this one statement in my own defense.
00:32:41 Okay.
00:32:42 You guys know me.
00:32:43 You guys know me from living at your house and never leaving.
00:32:46 And you know, I love you, I love you boys.
00:32:48 Mwah.
00:32:49 But, but I don't feel any need to impress you.
00:32:51 So yeah, when I, when I, when I never leave the house and I never leave my room, yeah,
00:32:55 my hygiene is pretty bad.
00:32:57 When I go out, generally I shower and I fucking make sure I smell okay.
00:33:01 Not a hundred percent of the time.
00:33:02 There have been times when I've been like, well, I fucking, I let the day get past me
00:33:06 and it didn't shower.
00:33:07 Fuck it.
00:33:08 And I go out smelling like, smelling like, like, like a scrapbook of farts.
00:33:12 But, but, but most of the time I go out.
00:33:15 You nonetheless concede that you do only wear like two pairs of pants in three shirts that
00:33:21 you don't wash very often.
00:33:23 Six shirts, but yes.
00:33:24 What would you say the longest you've ever gone wearing the same pair of pants was?
00:33:29 Is it six months?
00:33:30 I've definitely been wearing those fucking shorts for at least a month.
00:33:34 Oh yeah.
00:33:35 Yeah.
00:33:36 I would, I would grant you a month.
00:33:37 Do you mean underpants?
00:33:38 No.
00:33:39 No.
00:33:40 No, like actual pants.
00:33:41 Have you seen his, his orange?
00:33:42 American pants.
00:33:43 His like yellow and orange, uh, like long baggy shorts.
00:33:46 Yeah.
00:33:47 Slums that look like starbursts.
00:33:48 What do you call short pants in England?
00:33:51 Shorts?
00:33:52 Okay.
00:33:53 But not trousers.
00:33:54 But you also call underwear shorts, right?
00:33:56 No.
00:33:57 Underwear is pants.
00:33:58 Those are pants.
00:33:59 Okay.
00:34:00 Yeah.
00:34:01 Well anyway.
00:34:02 Yeah.
00:34:03 Rouses.
00:34:04 What the wrong trousers?
00:34:06 It's not a little bit of cheese, sir.
00:34:09 Well, Ben has this pair of shorts that goes like past the knees and they're these like
00:34:14 acid, yellow, uh, orange.
00:34:15 Oh, I've seen those all the time.
00:34:17 Yeah.
00:34:18 And he will wear them for literally a month at a time.
00:34:20 Well, that shorts aren't like, you know, they're just touching your legs.
00:34:23 Legs themselves don't get too...
00:34:25 I don't know, man.
00:34:26 My shit.
00:34:27 I know people that have worn the same pair of jeans for a year and never washed them.
00:34:31 And it's fine.
00:34:32 You're a fellow homeless people, Ben.
00:34:33 I have to change my clothes, like, every couple of days because they legitimately get filthy.
00:34:40 Like, I get my clothes really dirty.
00:34:42 Well, because I constantly wipe shit on them and, uh, like, just drop stuff.
00:34:48 Like, I'm a messy eater and I eat all the time, so I'm constantly dripping shit on my fucking pants.
00:34:53 Uh, you know, uh, don't clean up your jizz well enough and you got a jizz stain on your pants.
00:34:59 Yeah.
00:35:00 Yeah, you know, admittedly, like, despite everything you said about Ben, like, nothing that he's done has ever, like, been in my way,
00:35:06 slightly that's, like, causing me some amount of discomfort.
00:35:09 But didgy jizzing just gets all over the place.
00:35:11 There's a couple of times where didgy's breath in the car became, like, unavoidably felt like I was smelling an asshole.
00:35:17 And I don't know why.
00:35:18 I don't...
00:35:19 He's just eating something disgusting.
00:35:21 Like an asshole.
00:35:23 Hold on.
00:35:24 Let's go to mouth because I have a lot to say about mouth when I think...
00:35:27 Oh, wait, wait, wait.
00:35:28 I wanted to say...
00:35:30 Yeah, hippo, hippo, go ahead.
00:35:32 Well, I was gonna ask, like, because, you know, what was the longest...
00:35:36 I will say mine, but what was the longest people have gone without changing their underpants?
00:35:41 Because I think I've gone a whole week when I was just...
00:35:44 I've probably gone a week, yeah.
00:35:46 I think four days is probably my maximum.
00:35:48 Sometimes I put on the same ones I was wearing just because they don't get that...
00:35:51 My underwear don't get as dirty as the rest of my fucking clothes.
00:35:54 It gets to a point where it's like, I wonder how much worse this place can become.
00:36:00 You're just wondering.
00:36:02 I would say the smell doesn't get necessarily worse.
00:36:05 It's just, like, the feeling.
00:36:07 There is a definite end to that, like, downward bell curve where it basically makes no difference.
00:36:12 It just levels off.
00:36:13 It just levels off, yeah.
00:36:14 You might as well just keep going.
00:36:15 You asymptotically approach zero hygiene and then you just stay there.
00:36:19 My understanding is that a lot of women just wear the same bra for basically indefinitely
00:36:24 because nothing really gets all that sweaty there.
00:36:26 That's bullshit.
00:36:27 I don't believe that for one fucking second.
00:36:28 I've heard that.
00:36:29 You can basically go weeks without changing your bra because it's like...
00:36:32 Ladies, we're going to need you to weigh in on that in the comments down below.
00:36:37 I'll tell you, man, what made me learn...
00:36:38 I see some women in the comments, I'm going to kill myself.
00:36:40 What made me learn to appreciate...
00:36:42 Women don't have breasts.
00:36:43 Never bring that up again.
00:36:44 Okay, I'm sorry.
00:36:45 What made me learn to appreciate showering, like, because as a teenager, I just didn't
00:36:50 do it at all.
00:36:51 I would go to anime conventions, like, three days of nonstop heat and people moving and
00:36:58 being in cramped rooms and stuff, and I just wouldn't shower because I just felt like I
00:37:02 didn't have time.
00:37:03 Everybody else can do it, but I can fucking muscle through this because I'm a...
00:37:06 I don't know.
00:37:07 I have a weird pride in being able to do that.
00:37:09 But then there was one year where I got a violent case of swamp ass where it was just
00:37:15 like all of the sweat coming from my ass hair had made it just rub my ass raw.
00:37:23 My ass was burning red, and my thighs were burning red, and just everything was swampy
00:37:29 and shitty, and it was like, that was when I learned that, yes, at a convention, you
00:37:34 need to fucking shower in the middle of the day.
00:37:36 Hang on for one sec.
00:37:38 I just heard someone loudly vaping.
00:37:40 I believe that we just have discussed the vaping etiquette on this show.
00:37:43 God damn it.
00:37:44 Please calm your shit down.
00:37:45 I set my audio thresholds that it wouldn't pick up.
00:37:47 Fuck.
00:37:48 You're vaping.
00:37:49 Pretty fucking clearly.
00:37:50 Yes, man.
00:37:51 We get it.
00:37:52 You vape.
00:37:53 Let's move on with our lives.
00:37:55 Can you hear this?
00:37:57 Yeah.
00:37:58 Clear as day.
00:37:59 The fucking icon, the audio icon's off.
00:38:02 You shouldn't be able to hear it.
00:38:03 This is bullshit.
00:38:04 Imagine if it shows up for us, it'll still be in the audio recording on Audacity.
00:38:08 That's true.
00:38:09 The audience can suck it up.
00:38:11 Fuck the audience.
00:38:12 So one time, I think I was probably 11.
00:38:14 I was just like, I think previously, the previous year, just the previous summer, I just,
00:38:19 my butt sweated so often, and it was so uncomfortable.
00:38:21 That's actually not sweat, that's called poop.
00:38:24 There's a difference.
00:38:26 Well, that was a kid.
00:38:28 I couldn't deal with being hot or being sweaty.
00:38:31 It would just bug the shit out of me.
00:38:33 One year, I just thought, I'm not going to wear underwear this summer.
00:38:36 Okay.
00:38:37 And there were pros and cons to that.
00:38:39 I don't remember exactly the nature of it, but I remember concluding, this is ultimately
00:38:42 better somehow.
00:38:44 I guess because my ass is being aired out more.
00:38:47 Because when I had underwear the previous summer, I would just put, rub the back of
00:38:54 my butt crack and to shove the underwear in there so that it feels like there's a cork
00:38:58 going on.
00:38:59 Yeah, I do this.
00:39:00 It doesn't feel like it's like, like, like, you know, sweat that's clamily moving back
00:39:04 and forth.
00:39:05 You put a cork in your butthole?
00:39:07 No, not an actual cork.
00:39:09 Just shove your underwear up into your ass crack to avoid shaving.
00:39:12 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:39:14 I do, I do often, I do, well, walking around, I do, I do get thigh chafed sometimes, and
00:39:20 I'll, and I'll scooch, and I'll scooch my underwear up between the thighs.
00:39:23 Yeah, I do that all the time.
00:39:24 I wear, I wear very soft, I wear very soft, very soft silky.
00:39:28 No, no, no, no.
00:39:29 You guys need to work on your thigh gap.
00:39:30 I've never done it for chafing.
00:39:32 I believe you mean chafing means like it eventually starts to, like, hurt because of, you know,
00:39:37 I've never been fat enough for that.
00:39:39 It's just that it's uncomfortable.
00:39:40 It just feels clammy.
00:39:41 That happens whenever I go to Disneyland.
00:39:42 My thighs get super chafy.
00:39:44 I can't tell what's a joke about Disneyland and what's serious.
00:39:48 I get chafing not from my legs rubbing together, but from them rubbing against my gigantic
00:39:55 balls, and that's what causes it.
00:39:58 You just got to lubricate.
00:39:59 You just got to lubricate with some well-placed piss and just lubricate between the thighs.
00:40:02 My brother Shade has never worn underwear in his life.
00:40:06 What?
00:40:07 The fuck?
00:40:08 He has been free-balling for 20 years.
00:40:11 Holy shit.
00:40:12 That's cool.
00:40:13 He just decided as a little kid that he hated underwear and refused to wear it and has continued
00:40:16 to refuse.
00:40:17 I don't know if he wears it now that he's at work.
00:40:19 I don't know if that's harder to wear a uniform.
00:40:22 I mean, they're not going to force him to, you know?
00:40:24 The greatest fucking fear is that I'll either piss my pants or I'll come across like a dime
00:40:29 bridge and he'll be like, I forgot my pants.
00:40:32 I'm going to a job interview.
00:40:33 You need to give me your pants.
00:40:34 I'm sorry.
00:40:35 You'll see my beanie, sir.
00:40:36 I can't.
00:40:37 I can't give it to you.
00:40:40 It's the worst fear I could ever fucking have.
00:40:44 I get free-ball because of the kinds of pants I wear, because all of mine have just the
00:40:51 one button holding the print together.
00:40:53 And so, I mean, I sometimes have to be underwearless because I'm like doing laundry or something.
00:40:58 And my dick, I have to just like rearrange my pants and wear a big shirt so my dick doesn't
00:41:02 just fly out that hole.
00:41:03 Not to brag or anything.
00:41:05 Not to brag or anything, but I can't free-ball because my fucking bold is just too pronounced.
00:41:10 It's just-
00:41:11 You know, my brother-
00:41:12 I need some-
00:41:13 You have a pretty pronounced bold.
00:41:16 I do.
00:41:17 I do.
00:41:18 It's true.
00:41:19 I need the tightness of the underwear to like tamp it down a little, just so it's not completely
00:41:24 obscene.
00:41:25 Yeah.
00:41:25 When my brother was like fat, when he was chubby, he developed a special technique for
00:41:29 the amusement of others where he would stand up, lift up his right leg, and then like shake
00:41:33 his leg to where the fat on his leg would smack his balls and make him kill over, and
00:41:37 he would do it every time and it was super fun.
00:41:39 It was a very specific like martial art move, and it was really funny.
00:41:43 What the-
00:41:44 What?
00:41:45 Ball kata.
00:41:48 Okay.
00:41:49 I want to transition us from-
00:41:51 To female.
00:41:52 To teeth, and here's how I'm going to do so.
00:41:55 Because one of the reasons I have to change my shirts is that my version of quote-unquote
00:42:01 brushing your teeth is that when I wake up and my teeth feel a little fuzzy, usually just
00:42:08 the front six on the top, I just take my shirt and I rub it against my teeth.
00:42:13 Holy shit.
00:42:14 Why don't you just brush your teeth like a human being?
00:42:17 Alright, I'm done.
00:42:18 It's literally a sin.
00:42:20 It's literally a sin.
00:42:22 Did you redo, right?
00:42:24 Yes.
00:42:25 Use like a tissue, at least.
00:42:28 I've done this, I use tissues, I throw them away, I don't have-
00:42:31 Tissues will get up and they'll dissolve and get all on your teeth though.
00:42:35 Yeah, that's why you fold it once so that it doesn't.
00:42:38 I don't know about that.
00:42:40 I just have the inside of my shirt.
00:42:42 Did you secretly do an experiment or a towel?
00:42:45 Did you secretly part of an experiment to have the world's worst possible teeth and
00:42:49 everything he does feeds into it?
00:42:50 We both went to the dentist the last month, but he forgot the appointment just long enough
00:42:55 to where I could go to the dentist, but he had to reschedule for later.
00:42:59 I'm not super scrupulous about brushing my teeth.
00:43:02 I fail to brush my teeth sometimes, but when I do, when I do, I am so intense about it.
00:43:09 I get all my teeth and then I brush the roof of my mouth and the tongue and I fucking gag
00:43:13 myself on the brush because I'm like, I gotta get it all.
00:43:17 I gotta get all the surfaces, all the surfaces need to be clean.
00:43:20 Yeah, that's not how it works.
00:43:21 I've brushed my teeth maybe 15 times in the last 15 years.
00:43:26 Whoa, alright.
00:43:28 I have a little yarn to weave.
00:43:30 I have a little yarn to weave.
00:43:32 When I was a lesser baby, I truly, truly loved to brush my teeth.
00:43:37 It was the greatest pastime I could possibly have.
00:43:39 I had the fucking toothbrush that would play sick jams such as We Are the Kids of the Nation
00:43:44 whenever I brush my teeth.
00:43:45 Yeah, the singing toothbrush.
00:43:46 Sick, dude.
00:43:47 What are you talking about?
00:43:48 You had a musical toothbrush?
00:43:49 Yeah, it's like you press a button and it just starts playing a song and you're meant to brush
00:43:53 for the length of the song, so it teaches kids how long they should brush for.
00:43:57 Whoa, that's cool.
00:43:58 That's a very mid-2000s thing.
00:44:00 I would walk into my dentist's office and I would slap her ass and I would say,
00:44:04 Doc, how's my teeth?
00:44:06 And she'd be like, oh boy, you did a good job.
00:44:09 And I'd be like, sick.
00:44:11 And then I started watching a little man, a little boy, that I had to get my inspective
00:44:16 monoclonal.
00:44:17 I would have to inspect him and he would say, did you bro?
00:44:20 And he was like, are you talking about something like making a fan thick or something about
00:44:24 pink probably brushing your teeth or something?
00:44:26 Oh yeah.
00:44:28 And then I was like, you know, maybe brushing your teeth isn't cool.
00:44:32 And I stopped brushing my teeth.
00:44:34 So my fan thick that was meant to teach kids how much they should brush their teeth taught
00:44:38 you to stop.
00:44:39 Yeah.
00:44:40 I assume, Digi, I know about that fan thick and I assume that you wrote that because
00:44:45 you had at some point learned the value of brushing your teeth and wanted to impart
00:44:49 it to others.
00:44:50 So no, it's meant to be a don't be like me fan thick.
00:44:52 Digi, it's not too late.
00:44:54 You can change.
00:44:55 I don't think so.
00:44:56 Half his teeth are gone now.
00:44:58 That's not even true.
00:45:00 Well, here's the thing.
00:45:02 By the time I was like 11 and I was brushing my teeth as a kid, just not well.
00:45:07 I was doing it like once a day when I got up for school and never on weekends.
00:45:11 But I drank soda constantly for most of my life.
00:45:14 So by the time I was 11, I already had like 10 fillings.
00:45:18 Like I was already just constantly getting cavities.
00:45:21 And then there was a period of like four years where I just like didn't brush, didn't go
00:45:25 to the dentist at all because we had just been changing houses so often that I didn't
00:45:28 have like a assigned dentist.
00:45:31 And I was convinced when I was like 14 that.
00:45:35 Oh, I remember this.
00:45:37 Holy shit.
00:45:38 I forgot about this.
00:45:39 If I didn't brush my teeth, I would eventually build up an immunity.
00:45:43 I thought I would be the beginning of a new stage of human evolution where like the stuff
00:45:53 that would build up would eventually protect me from the other stuff or something.
00:45:57 And you would pass it on to your children?
00:46:00 Yeah.
00:46:01 So I just thought like because you know how like everything else on your body works that
00:46:06 way.
00:46:07 Like, you know, you rip your muscle and it grows back stronger.
00:46:09 So I thought.
00:46:10 Not if you break your bones.
00:46:11 Let's just get weaker.
00:46:12 Yeah.
00:46:13 What about, uh, she's, she's, uh, what's his name?
00:46:14 Fuck you.
00:46:15 His bones kept coming back stronger and he's a real person.
00:46:17 He's not an animal character.
00:46:18 Yeah, he's a real, real man.
00:46:19 DG Browns is going to break his bones.
00:46:22 So yeah.
00:46:23 So and then I was drinking Mountain Dew for like 10 years.
00:46:26 So I ended up with.
00:46:27 That helped.
00:46:28 I'm sure I probably have like green teeth.
00:46:30 I probably have like 20 to 25 fillings in total.
00:46:34 And then I quit drinking Mountain Dew.
00:46:36 I gotta have at least a dozen.
00:46:38 I finally stopped getting nearly as many cavities once I stopped drinking soda regularly.
00:46:43 Like once I switched to green tea, I've gone years without them.
00:46:46 Uh, like, like, like, I don't mean I have gone consistent years without them.
00:46:51 I mean, there have been years where I didn't have a cavity as opposed to every year I have
00:46:55 three.
00:46:56 Um, so yeah, I do have really fillings and bumps in my mouth.
00:47:01 What really bums me out about cavities and fillings is that like at some point, like
00:47:05 I got fillings throughout my life, but at some point they started giving me the white ones
00:47:10 and those are great.
00:47:11 But like the early ones, the ones I got early in my youth are the shitty black metal ones.
00:47:15 Yeah, I've got a lot of those.
00:47:16 Yeah.
00:47:17 And I had like my back molars have these disgusting black fillings and like they're normal because
00:47:22 like my, my dad had them.
00:47:25 So like they seem normal to me, but I think about like to a person that doesn't have cavities,
00:47:29 it must look fucking horrible and I feel so self-conscious about it sometimes.
00:47:33 Who the fuck is looking at the inside of your mouth?
00:47:36 My lover.
00:47:37 She's your age.
00:47:39 Uh, like, I mean, I, all of mine, maybe I don't feel self-conscious about that because
00:47:44 they're all on the inside of the teeth.
00:47:46 Like none of them are on the front or anything.
00:47:48 But yeah, I have a ton.
00:47:49 The smiling is what counts if you ask me.
00:47:52 Even though I've been, I, I, I am, I do have gross teeth and they're all like yellow and
00:47:57 like if I can just, I just touch it like real quick like uh, uh, uh, oh that's, it's fucking,
00:48:01 it's about to fall out.
00:48:02 If I just pull, I just feel like if I just pull it a little bit, it'll fall out and
00:48:06 they're awful teeth and my, my breath could inspire racial riots.
00:48:10 It's that bad.
00:48:11 The thing about, the thing about getting into brushing your teeth.
00:48:14 Fuck up.
00:48:15 Thank you.
00:48:16 Are you finishing your point?
00:48:17 All right.
00:48:18 No, I wasn't.
00:48:19 But I am happy to report.
00:48:21 That through, for my, all my years, I've only had one cavity, even though I literally
00:48:25 never brushed my teeth and I drink soda every day of my fucking life.
00:48:28 Wow.
00:48:29 You don't have to get there.
00:48:30 Give it time.
00:48:31 My teeth are just perfect.
00:48:32 Um, I remember, and I, I, I'm the kind of person who will take all kinds of selective,
00:48:36 uh, uh, encouragement.
00:48:37 Like one time when I was like 15, I was listening to this radio show and this guy was calling
00:48:42 in about how he was like 23 and he'd already lost all his teeth.
00:48:46 Um, but and he had like dentures, but he was talking about how the ladies love it when
00:48:50 he goes down on them.
00:48:51 Cause he could just pop out his teeth and just.
00:48:53 Oh my fucking god.
00:48:56 You see, you see folks, there's a silver loud cloud by every lining.
00:49:00 Yeah.
00:49:01 Yeah.
00:49:02 Um, but like the worst thing about trying to get into brushing my teeth like is that
00:49:08 it is really painful cause my gums can't handle it.
00:49:12 So I just bleed profusely if I brush my teeth.
00:49:15 Yeah.
00:49:16 You gotta keep it up.
00:49:17 You gotta keep it up.
00:49:18 It's constant.
00:49:19 And flossing sucks.
00:49:21 Uh, as an English man, I would stereotypically have the worst teeth here, but I think, I
00:49:27 think it's, it's a combination of, cause I don't brush my teeth as much.
00:49:31 I mean, I've been trying to recently, like every day I've been like morning and night,
00:49:35 morning and night.
00:49:36 It's actually been working and the, the first few days it was bleeding and now it's not
00:49:39 bleeding.
00:49:40 So I guess, you know, just keep doing it.
00:49:41 But yeah.
00:49:42 Um, I think it's a combination of, of the fact that I've never, ever liked soda in any
00:49:47 form is disgusting.
00:49:48 And I don't have a sweet tooth the same way that other people do.
00:49:52 I don't even.
00:49:53 And I've just been lucky in that, but I still, I think I have like six or seven feelings
00:49:57 I think, but it's, you know, I, I, I think my teeth, and they're not crooked.
00:50:01 I've never needed braces.
00:50:03 So I'm lucky.
00:50:04 Why, why is the amount of brushing I don't do, they would, they would have been far worse
00:50:08 if I ate like the wrong stuff.
00:50:10 Yeah.
00:50:11 But why is it that, that English men are known for their bad teeth?
00:50:13 Is it just that your culture doesn't care as much or?
00:50:16 I think, um, part of it is probably, yeah, that I think I've explained this somewhere
00:50:20 before, but it's the, the idea that people who get on British TV, they don't need to
00:50:24 have perfect teeth to, you know, to be allowed on.
00:50:28 So people get this, this, uh, this idea that all British people are like, I remember when
00:50:33 a really, I think, I think it's, I remember a cracked article saying that like, well,
00:50:37 they did some studies and British people actually have the best teeth in terms of not having
00:50:41 fillings and, but, but, but they're not great in terms of being white.
00:50:45 Like that culture doesn't care as much about yellow teeth.
00:50:48 So they're presenting themselves grossly, but they're actually really good at tooth
00:50:51 maintenance.
00:50:52 Well, that's the thing.
00:50:53 The thing is that it's not that it's actually gross to have discolored teeth.
00:50:57 It's just that our, like, we just have grown in obsession with the idea that teeth should
00:51:02 be white because it's more aesthetic.
00:51:04 I feel like culturally America really adopted and got into the idea of orthodontia and braces
00:51:10 to like, like, or they were early adopters of that idea.
00:51:14 Cause when I went to Poland, a bunch of the adults that I worked with had like braces
00:51:18 and it was because like the idea of getting braces to fix your teeth was like not a thing
00:51:23 for their parents, but like they grew up and were like, yeah, I'd like to get some braces
00:51:28 and fix my teeth, but it was like a newer thing to them.
00:51:31 Incidentally, my mom got braces when she was like 48 and that's when she finally got her
00:51:36 teeth corrected.
00:51:37 My mom had braces like right up until like right before I was born actually in her mid-30s.
00:51:42 See, the reason I don't care, like people have constantly, like my parents are always
00:51:47 asking me like, are you sure you don't want braces?
00:51:48 Are you sure?
00:51:49 Cause I have, you know, fucked up misaligned teeth and I was just like, have you like literally
00:51:54 everyone I've ever known who has braces, those are like the most miserable years of
00:51:59 their entire life because not only do braces look fucking hideous, like they are the worst
00:52:04 Normal braces look totally fine.
00:52:06 It's only when you get like head-to-head or like the weird shit, like I had some weird
00:52:10 shit in my mouth for a while now.
00:52:11 Braces are the most aesthetically unappealing thing I've ever seen.
00:52:14 No, they're just, I mean, maybe I'm crazy, but when I was a kid, seeing people with braces
00:52:18 was just normal, like just like half the people I knew had braces, it wasn't weird.
00:52:22 Yeah, it's normal, it's just all so gross and shitty.
00:52:24 And entirely because of American TV shows, I associate braces with young teenage girls
00:52:30 and that means I like them.
00:52:33 I find braces hideous and disgusting and also they make it so there's like all kinds of shit
00:52:40 you can't eat while you've got braces, there's like you have to maintenance them or else
00:52:45 they don't even work.
00:52:46 You know what, Shade had braces for like two and a half years and they didn't even fucking
00:52:51 work properly because he maintenance them so badly it didn't take care of them that
00:52:55 now he's got other teeth issues.
00:52:57 Keep crying about braces but here's the deal, you put in the effort, you take the time,
00:53:01 you make the sacrifices necessary, you reap the rewards, whatever they may be, they're
00:53:04 purely aesthetic, they're just aesthetic.
00:53:05 The reward is that you have to wear a retainer every night for the rest of your fucking life.
00:53:09 No, you don't.
00:53:10 Hold on, hold on.
00:53:11 If you want it to say perfect, you do.
00:53:13 They tell you that, too.
00:53:15 I wear my, okay, here's the thing, I do wear my, all right, you guys have been dancing,
00:53:19 you've been dancing with my date, this entire podcast.
00:53:22 Me too.
00:53:23 It's not for me to take the reins over, okay?
00:53:25 Because you guys are a bunch of fucking pansies.
00:53:28 But you're not ready to step up to the plate to be men and deal with this hygiene thing
00:53:32 because I would say that I definitely have the best hygiene of anyone in the PCP.
00:53:36 For sure.
00:53:37 Because I am on top of this shit.
00:53:38 No one would question that.
00:53:39 I am dedicated.
00:53:40 I don't know, I'm not convinced.
00:53:41 Fucking state your case, bitch.
00:53:43 Okay, well first of all, I am dedicated to personal betterment and in a physical sense
00:53:48 and that I'm certain that I have the best routine when it comes to that shit.
00:53:52 And I would argue that is an extension of that.
00:53:54 But every single day, I brush my teeth twice a day.
00:53:57 I floss once a day, every single night.
00:53:59 I do not, I shower every other day at least, generally every single day.
00:54:02 But I'll, the one thing I do that is slightly unhygienic is that I go,
00:54:08 and it's because of my fucking clothing system.
00:54:11 Okay, every day, every week I do my clothes once, one time.
00:54:14 I do all my laundry.
00:54:15 And I don't have many gym clothes.
00:54:16 So I end up wearing the same gym clothes every day for one full week.
00:54:20 And I do not smell good at the end of that week.
00:54:23 Yeah, it's not good, it's not good.
00:54:25 What a disaster.
00:54:26 Are you getting off the topic of teeth here?
00:54:28 Who could bear to be around someone who gets sweaty and smelly in the gym?
00:54:35 Yeah, it's a nightmare.
00:54:37 But I don't know, other than that, I'm perfect.
00:54:41 That's what I'm trying to say, I'm the best person in the world.
00:54:43 The thing that I've always wrestled with as a teenager,
00:54:46 because I had acne and all that stuff,
00:54:48 and it's like, you have to suddenly really pay attention to how you wash yourself.
00:54:54 Because before, as a kid, you're always clean, kind of.
00:54:57 But then suddenly there's grease coming out of you, and you're like,
00:55:00 I don't know what to do.
00:55:02 And I've always had this, like, I know I can be clean, and I know it's better to be clean.
00:55:09 Yeah, I don't care what the fuck that was, Ben.
00:55:13 Excuse me.
00:55:14 Sorry.
00:55:15 What's happening?
00:55:17 God damn it, what the fuck was anyone talking about?
00:55:19 I was gonna say, there's always been this, like, the cool kids were the ones that were well kept.
00:55:28 Right, right.
00:55:30 It felt like, you know, if you weren't popular, there's no reason to be well kept.
00:55:38 Did it ever occur to you that maybe that well keeping of oneself is what makes them popular?
00:55:42 No, no, no, no, this is my point.
00:55:44 I knew deep down that I had to do all these things.
00:55:47 I was just lazy, and it was just me trying to come to terms with the fact that I was so lazy,
00:55:52 and this is the root of all my real problems, is that sometimes I stink a bit,
00:55:56 and sometimes my breath probably is a little bad, and that, you know, I was never gross in public, obviously.
00:56:03 I developed something of a reputation amongst my friends, not in high school, but after high school,
00:56:09 of, like, taking long to get ready for things, because I wouldn't want to do anything until I had, like,
00:56:14 perfectly prepared myself.
00:56:16 See, that right there is the epitome of everything that I find, that is why I don't do hygiene,
00:56:22 because it's just, it's in the way.
00:56:24 It is in the way, that's true.
00:56:25 It's in the way of everything else, and, like, the idea of it is that it'll make the experience better, right?
00:56:31 Like, if you're feeling...
00:56:32 Socially, yes.
00:56:33 It'll make the experience of you better for others.
00:56:35 Well, yeah, which can make the experience better.
00:56:38 I mean, if you don't smell, that also helps you.
00:56:41 You don't want to smell yourself.
00:56:42 You want to feel confident that other people like the way you look, you know?
00:56:46 Yeah.
00:56:47 And so it does benefit you.
00:56:48 Right, right.
00:56:49 But at the same time, the amount of preparation that there is in everything to create this...
00:56:55 It's really, it's a lifestyle, is what it is.
00:56:57 It creates this perfect version of you that, like, you know, that maybe will be, will just have a better time in general.
00:57:04 But for me, it's like, I want to be able to just hit the ground running in everything I do.
00:57:09 Like, I'm the type of guy who, when I wake up in the morning, I jump out of bed and I get right on the computer
00:57:15 and I continue what I was doing the night before.
00:57:17 There's no, there's no moment where I have to, like, wake up, get ready to start the day,
00:57:22 take a shower, brush my teeth, do all that shit.
00:57:25 There's no, like, preparation.
00:57:27 Like, if I want to go out, it's because I'm hungry and I'm gonna go.
00:57:30 I'm not gonna sit around and do all this other shit.
00:57:32 Which is why I have such a difficult time brushing my teeth.
00:57:35 Because, like, my dentist is always like, why don't you just, you know, find, like,
00:57:40 maybe every time you take a shower or something, it's like, yeah, but I take a shower at completely random times
00:57:44 because I've decided I smell too bad to deal with myself.
00:57:47 Like, it's not something I do with this, this, like, preparation formula that I think a lot of people have.
00:57:52 I just, to me, it's not worth the effort because I don't feel like the...
00:57:57 I mean, I totally appreciate the gains you get from it.
00:58:00 Like, I do, sometimes, I take a shower, I put on, like, some well-fitting clothes,
00:58:05 and I go out into the world and I feel more confident than usual.
00:58:08 And I'm like, yeah, okay, this is a cool feeling, but it's not worth the effort to have that all the time.
00:58:13 If I think I smell, but, like, I, you know, on the one hand, mind over matter,
00:58:19 and, like, it's just a confidence thing, whatever.
00:58:21 But, like, if I go out and I know that, like, I'm unkempt and I smell weird,
00:58:25 I definitely act different and I am, like, shy and I don't want to talk to anyone.
00:58:29 I will be more sheepish.
00:58:30 Keep myself at arm's length from everyone.
00:58:32 Particularly if I'm, like, really disgusting and wearing the bathrobe and, like, flip flops or something,
00:58:37 then I'm, like, I will be more, like, yeah, I don't deserve to talk to these people.
00:58:41 You know, I do have good hygiene.
00:58:44 Hang on, I have good hygiene, but I have been known to just wear my pajamas,
00:58:49 throw on my bathrobe and my fucking beanie, and just bomb down the road in my fucking minivan.
00:58:57 See, here's what I do.
00:58:59 KFC to pick me up some fucking golden nuggets.
00:59:04 When it comes to, like, cleaning shit and maintaining myself as a person,
00:59:07 I just kind of weave it naturally into, like, like, like compulsions I get.
00:59:11 I try to, like, reprogram my own compulsions, right?
00:59:14 There's so many times when you have to be doing a thing, like, editing a video,
00:59:18 and you're like, you just want to come up with something to do to distract you,
00:59:22 like, I'm going to go out and, you know, either send them in a roll or I'm going to go...
00:59:25 I set that moment where I realized that, like, the time that DeVue is on this podcast
00:59:30 is taking away from time he could be editing my video right now.
00:59:33 Oh, fuck off.
00:59:34 Yeah, yeah.
00:59:35 We're in a time crunch, as always.
00:59:37 Yes, so, uh, fucking...
00:59:39 Life is a time crunch.
00:59:40 All I did was I just convinced myself that brushing, flossing, and mouth-washing my teeth
00:59:44 is one of the many things I can do to, like, put something off for five more minutes,
00:59:49 or to think about something.
00:59:50 You know what's a key for me?
00:59:51 Fucking don't take my earbuds out ever.
00:59:53 There was one fateful day when I realized I just have my earbuds in all the time when I'm at work,
00:59:58 the whole time when I'm asleep, I'm going to go brush my teeth with my earbuds in.
01:00:01 My brother saw me in the bathroom, burst out laughing.
01:00:04 I don't give a shit.
01:00:05 I never take my earbuds out.
01:00:07 I'm hearing about the history of Nazi Germany for the third time this year,
01:00:11 and I'm going to fucking do it while brushing my teeth, while cooking food,
01:00:14 and I also have a shower speaker that's waterproof, and you can Bluetooth it to your phone.
01:00:19 So anything where, like, I want to hear someone's voice.
01:00:23 I want to, like, hear someone vaguely talking about something,
01:00:25 but I don't want to necessarily hear exactly what they're saying because I can't hear it.
01:00:28 I just put on one of Digi's vlogs, and then you go take a shower that way.
01:00:32 Speaking.
01:00:33 And so that way I never get bored.
01:00:35 That way I can never, as long as I'm listening to something, I can always just keep going forever.
01:00:40 I'm very much into, like, to mood-crafting, and so if I'm going to, like,
01:00:46 if I'm going to go, like, shave or something, I'll throw on some, like, loud masculine music, you know?
01:00:52 Yeah.
01:00:53 Like, when I shave, you know, I throw off my shirt.
01:00:56 I'm, like, you know, getting all ready.
01:00:58 I've got all the shaving stuff around, and it's like, yeah, this is a man's time.
01:01:02 I need some abrasive masculine-sounding shit, you know?
01:01:06 Speaking of crafting your own, like, habits, DeVoo.
01:01:10 Okay, so I have a number of weird, like, nervous compulsions and ticks and stuff.
01:01:15 And I have tried in the past to stop some of them.
01:01:19 But what always inevitably happens is that if I manage to stop one, something else pops up to replace it.
01:01:24 And, like, I have a rotation of them that I sometimes go through.
01:01:27 And, like, specifically I'm thinking of biting my nails.
01:01:30 I've always bit my nails, like, right down to the quick, all the time, my whole life.
01:01:34 And one time I was like, I'm not going to do that.
01:01:36 But what ended up happening is that I stopped biting my nails, but I started compulsively clipping them all the time.
01:01:42 And it was just as bad. And, in fact, it was way less convenient.
01:01:46 And I have, yeah, like, I have the hair-pulling thing, and I have another thing where I do where I'll, like, twitch my, like, abdominal muscles sometimes.
01:01:54 And that's weird. Like, I hate that, because if I do that in public, I feel like everyone's staring at me.
01:01:58 Even though I don't think anyone has ever noticed me doing that, and yet I feel super weird about it.
01:02:02 I used to have a lot of weird compulsions.
01:02:04 And one I'm still not completely down with is scraping my index finger on my right hand into my thumbnail.
01:02:12 And it slowly creates a twitch.
01:02:14 Literally what I'm doing right now.
01:02:15 Right. Now, the reason why I started doing it is because...
01:02:18 I can't even get my index finger to, like, touch my thumbnail at, like, a proper angle.
01:02:22 Well, what happened is that one day I was, like, reaching for the door and I jammed my fucking thumb against it and cracked it in that exact spot, right?
01:02:29 And so, like, it was like, ow, pain, bitch, ass, nigger, fuck.
01:02:32 And then, like, it happened, like, three more times in the course of, like, 18 months for some fucked-up reason.
01:02:37 I think it was just the specific angle that I was grabbing that doorknob with.
01:02:41 Just sometimes I would crack my thumbnail.
01:02:43 So I became so compulsive to have that little trench be there that eventually I started...
01:02:48 I built up this weird habit of doing that.
01:02:50 And you can actually see it.
01:02:51 I was getting away from hygiene.
01:02:52 In the cuticle...
01:02:53 Well, when the fuck...
01:02:54 When top of game, am I gonna talk about my cuticle?
01:02:56 The part of your nail that goes on?
01:02:57 Yeah, it has to come...
01:02:58 Why discuss this at some point, did you?
01:03:00 There's, like, a weird rift in it.
01:03:01 That's, like, weird.
01:03:02 Anyway, well, hey, you know, we were supposed to talk about braces and we switched that top before I got to go to it.
01:03:07 So can we go back to braces?
01:03:08 Yeah, so listen, here's the thing.
01:03:10 But no, I want to ask Nate a question about fingernails.
01:03:14 Because Nate, you seem to be an expert on hygiene.
01:03:17 What is the...
01:03:18 How long do you go between cooking your fingernails?
01:03:21 What do you think is the proper amount of time?
01:03:23 Here's the thing.
01:03:24 My biggest failure in life, in my life, is my obsession with biting and clipping my fingernails.
01:03:31 Nate?
01:03:32 Which fucks me up.
01:03:33 I'm not gonna go into details, but Nate...
01:03:35 No!
01:03:36 Fuck his fingers up at certain points.
01:03:37 No!
01:03:38 Nate, fuck them right the fuck right.
01:03:39 That's not true.
01:03:40 I've always...
01:03:41 You're going over the top.
01:03:42 No, I'm not, dude.
01:03:43 No, I'm not.
01:03:44 I've always been a long fingernail boy because I just don't...
01:03:48 Like, they grow really fast.
01:03:49 I don't know how long after I'm supposed to clip them.
01:03:51 I probably do it once a month, but they're always...
01:03:53 They get really fucking long.
01:03:55 But I always got complimented on them by girls.
01:03:58 Because my fingernails just happen to grow perfect.
01:04:00 Like, they're just beautiful white.
01:04:02 Yeah, they're like, wow, those look like real good hand job giving hands.
01:04:05 You could really, you know, make some money with those.
01:04:07 Girls would ask me if I had had a French manicure, like, all the time.
01:04:10 And I was like, no, I don't know what that is.
01:04:12 But yeah, so I have perfect, beautiful hands and nails.
01:04:15 I'm basically like a hand model.
01:04:17 Basically, George Costanza.
01:04:18 George Costanza.
01:04:19 Yeah.
01:04:21 But, yeah.
01:04:23 But then guys would always say that my nails are too long.
01:04:25 They'd say I was a faggot.
01:04:27 I got no idea.
01:04:28 I would say that a lot of people...
01:04:30 I don't know.
01:04:31 It's considered effeminate to have nails that even show, like, any of the white at the end.
01:04:35 So, like, I don't know, I guess, like, for guys.
01:04:37 Well, I just...
01:04:38 It just so happened that I happened to watch, like, some ASMR video
01:04:41 where there was just, like, a guy's hands the other day.
01:04:43 And, like, a lot of the comments, like, he just had, like, a little bit of the white.
01:04:46 Like, they went, like, to the edge of his finger, you know, like, not really past,
01:04:49 but to the edge.
01:04:50 And there was some white.
01:04:51 And, like, a lot of the comments were talking about how girly his fingernails were.
01:04:54 Dude, guys, you're missing the male ASMR.
01:04:56 You can't complain about gayness.
01:04:58 I only listen to male ASMR because female ASMR is literally gay.
01:05:01 Yeah.
01:05:02 We're gonna have a podcast about that one, though.
01:05:04 Deal with it.
01:05:05 Deal with it.
01:05:06 Even though I'm a gross boy, whenever I go out of the house,
01:05:09 like, no matter what, no matter how long it would be outside the house,
01:05:12 I will take a shower.
01:05:14 I'll take a shower and I'll put on a new pair of clothes.
01:05:16 And I often stay in my house, so I'll go every few days without taking a shower or anything.
01:05:21 But no matter what, no matter the circumstance, if I leave the house,
01:05:25 I will take a shower.
01:05:27 I wish I had your discipline.
01:05:29 So here's the thing about nails, right?
01:05:31 Like, my dad, a couple, because back when I was a teenager,
01:05:33 I didn't have the habit of doing it until I built up the compulsion to do it sometimes.
01:05:37 And, like, my dad was like, I don't know why you like growing your nails out long.
01:05:41 And I feel like he was saying it with the connotation of, I'm wondering if you're gay, right?
01:05:45 Are you gay, right?
01:05:46 And, like, because my dad is just, my dad is really great hygiene, right?
01:05:49 So, like, that's how I was able to build up decent habits, right?
01:05:51 Like, my dad brushes his teeth, I think, three times a day.
01:05:54 Okay.
01:05:55 And, like, when does he do the third one?
01:05:57 Just, like, in the middle, like, after lunch?
01:05:59 Maybe it's two times a day, I don't know.
01:06:00 Like, maybe when he's home on a weekend, it's three times a day.
01:06:03 Yeah, so, like, you know, when I was a kid,
01:06:05 I had a big ego about, like, being a good kid, you know,
01:06:08 because this was before I hit puberty and also before it turned out everyone hates me
01:06:12 and I can't finance it with society.
01:06:14 So, when I was a kid, I had this, you know, this big, yeah,
01:06:16 just driven by my self-image of being, like, well-kempt and stuff, right?
01:06:20 You know, back when I was, like, good at math and shit, lol, in, like, second grade, right?
01:06:25 So, like, yeah, like, oh, I brush my teeth, you know?
01:06:28 It's never been about not having good teeth.
01:06:32 It's never been about avoiding cavities, blah, blah, blah.
01:06:34 You don't want to get dentures, you don't want to look old.
01:06:36 It's just, it's entirely been a lifelong campaign of pride for me.
01:06:41 And so, like, my whole childhood never had any cavities.
01:06:43 My brother got some cavities, my sister got some cavities,
01:06:45 because they aren't fueled by ego as much as I am, right?
01:06:48 So, but then when I was a teenager, like, like, it finally came time
01:06:51 to deal with my incredibly fucked-up sharp teeth, right?
01:06:54 I have, um, I have, like, what you call a bonus tooth.
01:06:56 Well, that's what it is now.
01:06:58 But yeah, I had just, like, I had this, like, tooth room.
01:07:00 It was the council of teeth and my tongue could just sit in there
01:07:03 and just, like, rest in this little, little tiny couch of teeth.
01:07:07 It was terrible, horribly uncomfortable.
01:07:09 I had this incredible compulsion.
01:07:10 I have no idea what you're describing right now.
01:07:12 It's just extra teeth. It's like I had multiple rows of teeth, right?
01:07:15 I had so many fucking extra teeth.
01:07:17 My mouth is too small.
01:07:18 How many extra teeth did you have?
01:07:20 I mean, wait, were you Sharkboy and was your sister Lavagirl?
01:07:23 Is that what you're telling me right now?
01:07:24 Yes, absolutely. She also has too many teeth.
01:07:26 I kind of know what you're talking about,
01:07:27 because I grew a, like, a set of canines over my canines
01:07:32 and that eventually got, like, pushed them out and destroyed them.
01:07:36 What the shit, dude?
01:07:38 Is it literal?
01:07:39 Are you sure you're not talking about baby teeth and adult teeth?
01:07:41 I'm talking about when I was, like, 18.
01:07:43 Manchi, what the fuck kind of humans are these?
01:07:46 I don't know.
01:07:47 I long after having lost all my baby teeth,
01:07:49 grew in an extra pair of canines over my original ones
01:07:54 that pushed them out and eventually moved all the rest of my teeth
01:07:58 out of where they were so that they could fit in
01:08:00 and slot into the rest of my teeth.
01:08:02 I thought everyone had the same amount of teeth.
01:08:04 I don't know. I don't know.
01:08:05 Yeah, I know.
01:08:06 People have different sizes of mouths, right?
01:08:08 I thought, like, humans were, like, defined by their number of teeth.
01:08:10 And the new ones, like, grew way bigger than the old ones.
01:08:13 I think everyone has the same amount of teeth.
01:08:15 I think everyone has the same amount of teeth.
01:08:17 Wait, wait, wait.
01:08:18 Are you just talking about, like, your adult teeth
01:08:20 grew in around your baby teeth?
01:08:22 No, motherfucker.
01:08:23 I'm talking about, in my late teens, a brand new set of canines
01:08:28 grew in and pushed the old ones out
01:08:32 and then moved all the rest of my teeth out of their way
01:08:36 so that they could fucking find a place.
01:08:38 Amazing.
01:08:39 So, yeah, so, like, if you guys want to know,
01:08:41 like, look, yeah, having braces is terrible.
01:08:44 There's a lot of things that suck about it,
01:08:46 particularly, like, when they fuck up or something goes wrong
01:08:48 or they're adjusting them, you know.
01:08:50 But for some mouths, it is fucking worth it, right?
01:08:55 And mine were.
01:08:56 Like, I have videos dating back to 2008.
01:08:58 Go to my playlists. You'll find them.
01:09:00 Listen to how I talk.
01:09:02 I struggled to speak.
01:09:03 I still do because I learned to speak, you know,
01:09:06 with a fucking fucked up set of teeth.
01:09:08 And I think I also have some sort of weirdly deformed tongue
01:09:11 that isn't long enough.
01:09:12 My tongue isn't long enough.
01:09:14 I can't stick my tongue out very far.
01:09:15 And it ends with, like, a nipple.
01:09:17 So I have a really weird tongue.
01:09:18 My whole weird, lispy voice, it's because of these two things.
01:09:22 Having bad teeth my whole life and having this weirdly fucked up tongue.
01:09:25 That's why I lisp like this.
01:09:27 That's why I sound like a huge fucking nerd all the time.
01:09:29 I've looked it up and what I believe it's hyperdontia,
01:09:32 the condition of having super, super numerary teeth,
01:09:37 or teeth that appear in addition to the regular number of teeth.
01:09:40 I didn't know that was a thing.
01:09:42 So, yeah.
01:09:43 So before they even started with putting on the braces,
01:09:45 they had to pull four of my fucking teeth out.
01:09:47 Four of my fucking teeth out.
01:09:48 And then it was like four years of having braces on,
01:09:51 although it could have probably been like three and a half,
01:09:53 because I got to the point where it was just like,
01:09:55 they weren't taking the braces off because like,
01:09:57 there's really no such thing as perfectly straight teeth,
01:10:00 so you can theoretically have them on forever.
01:10:02 So we had to specifically ask, can we have them off now?
01:10:04 And they're like, oh yeah.
01:10:05 And it was literally only the exact fucking moment
01:10:08 the braces were finally taken off in the clinic.
01:10:10 She gave me the retainer and said,
01:10:12 oh yeah, well how long do you wear these for?
01:10:14 As long as you want to have straight teeth.
01:10:16 I'm like, what the fuck?
01:10:17 I would not have signed up for the whole operation if I had known.
01:10:21 You would have had to permanently deal with bullshit.
01:10:23 This is my whole thing, right?
01:10:24 I don't want to have to deal with bullshit permanently
01:10:27 in any sort of way, right?
01:10:28 I'm fine with doing something as long as it's a temporary thing.
01:10:31 So I had the retainer on for one year,
01:10:33 and I'm like, this is not worth it.
01:10:35 No one I know keeps it in.
01:10:37 I still wear my braces.
01:10:38 I still wear my fucking retainer.
01:10:40 That's crazy dude, I don't wear mine.
01:10:42 I gave mine up in like a month.
01:10:44 I lost the bottom of my retainer though.
01:10:46 See, I talked to Shade and he's like,
01:10:48 yeah, my teeth are slowly going back out of alignment
01:10:51 because I didn't wear retainer and none of it was worth it.
01:10:54 Well, parents made so much money, we got to do it right by him.
01:10:57 I have one fucking tooth that's going out of alignment.
01:11:00 Okay, one of my molars is out of alignment
01:11:02 because the retainer cracked in that spot early on,
01:11:05 which is fucking fucked up,
01:11:06 and I didn't want to have to spend hundreds of dollars
01:11:08 to get it fixed and stuff.
01:11:09 But yeah, over time, I worked for a year, I gave up.
01:11:12 There is one tooth in the front of my teeth
01:11:14 that is being misaligned.
01:11:15 My girlfriend thought that I had just never gotten those teeth fixed.
01:11:18 She's like, when are you going to get bottom braces?
01:11:20 I'm like, but anyway, it is messed up.
01:11:23 Don't bitch fucking slut, god damn.
01:11:25 For the longest time, I've also had this one gap in my teeth
01:11:28 that always has a deposit of food every night,
01:11:31 which is a good-
01:11:32 Okay, great. That's a little snack for you at the end of the day.
01:11:34 Which can be a good survival tactic, you know?
01:11:36 You're like a chipmunk who stores shit in his face.
01:11:38 Can we move on from teeth to-
01:11:40 No, I'm not done yet.
01:11:41 This is not the teeth test.
01:11:43 Well, hold on.
01:11:44 It's not really about hygiene at this point.
01:11:46 It's more about the entire history of your teeth and how they've shaped it.
01:11:49 Well, hold on. I'm fucking doing it.
01:11:50 I'm fucking doing it.
01:11:51 So when I had the braces on, I didn't floss hardly at all
01:11:54 because you can't use those little convenient flossers.
01:11:56 You can't even do the thing where you wrap the floss around your fingers.
01:12:00 You have to fucking sew the food out.
01:12:02 You know, like, where you sew with a needle?
01:12:04 You have to do that shit, but to get food out of your teeth
01:12:06 takes 15 fucking minutes.
01:12:07 Almost never did it.
01:12:08 So, like, I was pretty concerned that I wasn't taking proper care of my teeth
01:12:11 and I could have had a cavity, but, you know,
01:12:13 I brushed them so much when I was a kid.
01:12:15 Also, like hippo, never drank much soda or had much candy.
01:12:18 Or at all, really.
01:12:19 But then, but then, as an adult,
01:12:22 I finally, like, got too old for the youth dentist.
01:12:25 And so my teeth were going un-maintained by a dentist.
01:12:28 I was brushing them.
01:12:29 I was also drinking lots of tea.
01:12:30 I was also drinking some coffee.
01:12:32 And, like, like, buildup was building up.
01:12:34 You know, staining.
01:12:35 And I remember talking about...
01:12:36 That is what buildup tends to do.
01:12:37 God damn it.
01:12:38 Like, I wrapped this shit up.
01:12:39 Where are you going with this?
01:12:40 And so then, my girlfriend was like,
01:12:42 dude, those might be cavities.
01:12:43 And I was like, holy shit.
01:12:44 Okay.
01:12:45 Because I remember saying this, like,
01:12:46 three or four weeks ago on a previous podcast
01:12:49 that, like, when I was a kid,
01:12:51 I was just boasting about how I've never had a cavity.
01:12:53 And my older cousin, Patricia Lepleb, said,
01:12:55 don't get cocky.
01:12:56 I got my first cavity when I was 22.
01:12:58 And I'm 22.
01:12:59 Almost, you know, almost done with being 22.
01:13:01 Might have cavities.
01:13:02 And it was literally the most nervous I've ever been
01:13:04 about anything in my life.
01:13:05 Purely as a matter of pride.
01:13:06 And I finally looked at them.
01:13:08 It was fucking buildup.
01:13:09 I was right.
01:13:10 I sent a huge boasting text to my cousin.
01:13:12 She's like, I don't remember saying that.
01:13:14 Like, I remember everything.
01:13:15 Of course not.
01:13:16 Of course not.
01:13:17 Having you learn how...
01:13:18 Tuesday.
01:13:19 Yeah.
01:13:20 That was just another day when I told people
01:13:22 that they are fucking going to get cavities.
01:13:24 Yeah.
01:13:25 Anyway, that's the reason to maintain yourself.
01:13:27 You'll feel superior over everyone else,
01:13:29 as I'm sure Nate has this whole podcast,
01:13:31 just being like, I'm such a better person.
01:13:33 You know, I do.
01:13:34 I do.
01:13:35 But the thing is, I spend my time in a gym
01:13:37 with people who are way above me,
01:13:38 so it keeps me looking for stuff
01:13:40 to be even more better than you guys.
01:13:42 When it comes to, for me,
01:13:44 I think I just don't like admitting that I'm wrong.
01:13:48 Right.
01:13:49 To admit that I've been, like, wrong
01:13:51 for not going all hygiene
01:13:53 of my whole teenage life.
01:13:55 And I, you know, I went to the dentist recently
01:13:58 and, you know, did all the checkups,
01:14:00 and I didn't get a feeling this time.
01:14:02 But they, you know, they said,
01:14:04 you should brush twice a day.
01:14:05 And every time I'd gone to the dentist,
01:14:07 they say that, and I'm usually like,
01:14:09 okay, like I'm not going to, but okay.
01:14:12 Yeah, okay, guys.
01:14:13 All right.
01:14:14 But this time, I just saw her.
01:14:16 I was an adult, and I was just looking at her.
01:14:18 And I'm like, yeah, you're right.
01:14:20 And now I'm doing that.
01:14:21 And that's just, I just,
01:14:23 because I know that, I know that being clean
01:14:25 makes me feel better than normal.
01:14:27 Yeah, it does.
01:14:28 So it's like, it's, it's,
01:14:29 I don't like to admit that I'm wrong,
01:14:31 but I'm totally wrong for ever being.
01:14:34 Guys, I have a huge branch
01:14:35 that this conversation could take
01:14:37 if you're down here.
01:14:38 Hold on.
01:14:39 Just to finish off,
01:14:40 to go off what Hippo was saying,
01:14:41 one of the recent times I went to the dentist,
01:14:43 she got so exasperated with me
01:14:44 that she literally said, like,
01:14:46 why do you even come here?
01:14:48 Like, if you're not going to take,
01:14:50 and I said,
01:14:51 I come here so you can see if I have cavities
01:14:54 so I can get them filled.
01:14:55 Like, I don't care about the cleaning
01:14:57 that you're going to do.
01:14:58 I'm just here for the X-rays, you know.
01:15:00 That's pretty fair.
01:15:01 When I say branch,
01:15:02 I'm saying it's 100% relevant.
01:15:03 It's just a subcategory, right?
01:15:05 Okay, well, what is it?
01:15:06 Well, I also, somewhere I want to take this,
01:15:08 but I'll hear yours.
01:15:09 We've been talking about like, you know,
01:15:10 like things you do on a daily basis
01:15:12 or a weekly basis, stuff like that.
01:15:13 What about stuff you do on a minute-by-minute basis?
01:15:15 Like, some shit got on your hands.
01:15:17 What do you do next?
01:15:18 Right?
01:15:19 That's a huge...
01:15:20 Well, there's specific ways to do it, you know.
01:15:22 Like, what's your policy on, like, you know...
01:15:25 Oh, I have a thing on this.
01:15:27 You throw it in the general direction of a trash can
01:15:29 and if you miss, it's no big deal.
01:15:31 I agree.
01:15:32 I went on the carpet.
01:15:34 When it comes to, like, small things like that,
01:15:39 if I've got a runny nose
01:15:41 and it's mostly water coming out of my nose,
01:15:43 then I will just get it with my hands if I don't have a tissue
01:15:45 and just rub my hands together until it evaporates.
01:15:48 Yeah, that's not real.
01:15:50 That's not a real thing.
01:15:51 No, if it's like an actual booger with, like, greenness in it,
01:15:54 then I will, like, get a tissue.
01:15:55 It's all booger.
01:15:56 It's 100% booger if it throws your nose.
01:15:58 If it's a runny nose, I will use my hands
01:16:00 and then evaporate it with friction.
01:16:02 No!
01:16:03 It's fine.
01:16:04 No!
01:16:05 Please!
01:16:06 On the onset of the nose, all throughout my childhood,
01:16:08 I was super, I was super, like,
01:16:10 get a Kleenex, I'm not going to pick my nose.
01:16:12 And then, like, one time, I was at my cousin's house
01:16:16 and he was playing Call of Duty and he wouldn't let me play
01:16:18 because he was an asshole.
01:16:19 Fuck you, Josh.
01:16:20 And then...
01:16:21 And then he started picking his nose.
01:16:24 And I was like, you shouldn't do that, bitch.
01:16:26 You shouldn't fucking do that.
01:16:27 That's wrong.
01:16:28 That's immoral what you're doing right now.
01:16:30 Yeah, exactly.
01:16:31 And he was like, you're gay, dude.
01:16:32 You should try it.
01:16:33 It's cool.
01:16:34 Oh, no.
01:16:35 He said you're done in dark.
01:16:36 Maybe I should.
01:16:37 Maybe...
01:16:38 And I only quit picking my nose,
01:16:41 like, two years ago.
01:16:43 Why would you quit?
01:16:44 I think everyone picks their nose at least a little bit, right?
01:16:47 What do you do to get the stuff out of your nose?
01:16:49 I get a napkin.
01:16:52 I pick my nose almost constantly.
01:16:54 Here's my nostril thing.
01:16:56 If it's, like, big, like, goopy, like,
01:16:58 I'm going to die, I can't breathe, sort of stuff,
01:17:00 then I will let it build up overnight.
01:17:02 And then, like, cannon blasts, like, explode.
01:17:04 I do that sometimes.
01:17:06 Yeah.
01:17:07 What else can you do?
01:17:08 I get in there constantly.
01:17:09 And I've got to say that my old chair,
01:17:12 one of my old black chairs,
01:17:13 which you've all sat in on the plebe and the weeb set,
01:17:16 for years, I was just wiping boogers on the back of the chair.
01:17:21 Amazing.
01:17:22 I would just pick my nose and go right to the back
01:17:24 or on the bottom.
01:17:25 And the bottom had sort of that, like,
01:17:29 like that fuzzy stuff on it.
01:17:32 And so the boogers would kind of, like,
01:17:34 hang from that.
01:17:35 No!
01:17:36 It was like all these hanging,
01:17:38 like, like, like the Pokemon Kokuna,
01:17:40 how it hangs from a, like that,
01:17:42 with a bunch of boogers.
01:17:43 No!
01:17:44 Like the Pokemon, not like the actual thing.
01:17:46 Yeah.
01:17:47 There was, like, hundreds.
01:17:49 Much more relatable.
01:17:50 There was, like, hundreds of boogers
01:17:51 all over the back of my chair.
01:17:52 And if anybody sat behind me,
01:17:53 they thought it was the most disgusting shit.
01:17:55 It sounds like some pretty disgusting shit.
01:17:57 But it's all behind me, so what do I care?
01:17:59 Yeah.
01:18:00 That's my retort.
01:18:01 When I finally replaced the chair,
01:18:05 I just took it out back
01:18:06 and just hosed it down.
01:18:07 Burned it?
01:18:08 Okay.
01:18:09 My brother had this.
01:18:10 You've all sat in it.
01:18:11 You've all been in this chair.
01:18:12 Had this childhood friend,
01:18:13 this childhood friend of my brothers
01:18:14 who lived in a bunk bed on the bottom bed,
01:18:17 and it was wooden.
01:18:18 So, like, above him was just this big plank of wood,
01:18:20 and he built up a deliberate booger collection,
01:18:22 which was quite a sight to behold.
01:18:24 But yeah, okay.
01:18:25 Guys, the subject of hands.
01:18:26 How much awareness do you have
01:18:27 about, like, the registry of everything
01:18:29 that's happened to these hands
01:18:31 since its last washing?
01:18:32 I'm like, okay.
01:18:33 Zero.
01:18:34 I make an effort to forget.
01:18:35 Sometimes I look at my hands,
01:18:37 and it's just fucking bleeding.
01:18:39 That's not a joke.
01:18:40 Sometimes I look at my hands,
01:18:41 and it's fucking bleeding.
01:18:42 That's true.
01:18:43 It's happened.
01:18:44 Why?
01:18:45 How?
01:18:46 I don't know.
01:18:47 What do you mean how?
01:18:48 It's just fucking bleeding, Nate.
01:18:49 I just burst my heartbeat.
01:18:50 It's too strong.
01:18:51 It clips the fucking microphone.
01:18:52 Exactly.
01:18:53 It's just out of my body.
01:18:54 What can you do?
01:18:55 I go by the George Carlin thing,
01:18:58 where I just, I mean,
01:18:59 I wash my hands when it's in a public place,
01:19:01 because, you know,
01:19:02 I don't want to look like an idiot.
01:19:04 But most of the time,
01:19:06 I just, you know,
01:19:07 if it doesn't feel gross,
01:19:08 then it isn't.
01:19:09 I wash my hands whenever I do anything
01:19:11 in my fucking life.
01:19:12 I do it at least, like, every 30 minutes.
01:19:14 For me, it's like a sixth sense.
01:19:15 It's like a seventh sense,
01:19:16 where it's like,
01:19:17 I have, like, this, you know,
01:19:19 subconscious knowledge of, like,
01:19:20 what each finger has done,
01:19:22 you know, and, like,
01:19:23 I make compromises
01:19:24 based on what's going on
01:19:25 in my environment.
01:19:26 Again, if I'm in a public place,
01:19:27 I'm like, okay,
01:19:28 if I have to touch a door handle
01:19:30 out in public,
01:19:31 then I will change my behavior
01:19:33 accordingly, you know.
01:19:34 That sounds like some super OCD shit.
01:19:36 No, I wouldn't say that.
01:19:38 Well, it's not really,
01:19:39 because it doesn't occupy my thoughts
01:19:41 that vividly.
01:19:42 It's happening sort of like
01:19:43 in the lower registry of my thoughts.
01:19:45 I mean, you know what I did?
01:19:46 I came up with a system,
01:19:47 sorry, I came up with a system years ago
01:19:49 that whenever I go to the bathroom
01:19:50 in a public place,
01:19:51 when I, you know,
01:19:52 I wash my hands,
01:19:53 I do whatever,
01:19:54 I get the paper towels,
01:19:55 I dry my hands,
01:19:56 I then use those paper towels
01:19:57 to open the door to exit,
01:19:58 because I know people
01:19:59 have been touching that shit.
01:20:00 I just discovered that one day.
01:20:01 I remember one,
01:20:02 I remember one time being in a public bathroom
01:20:04 that had this specially designed handle
01:20:06 that deliberately lets you
01:20:07 just open it with your shoulder or something,
01:20:09 and it had this huge list of instructions,
01:20:11 and it's like being put in there.
01:20:13 It felt like I was in some sort of like
01:20:14 torture device.
01:20:15 It felt like the position I had
01:20:17 to demean myself to assume.
01:20:19 I thought you were going to say
01:20:20 you felt like you were in the future.
01:20:21 Well, what happened was like,
01:20:22 the position I had to be in was like,
01:20:24 if someone were to push the door open
01:20:26 on the other side,
01:20:27 it's going to break my fucking arm.
01:20:28 So like clearly those things
01:20:29 didn't catch on, right?
01:20:30 That is awesome.
01:20:31 I love that.
01:20:32 Yeah, I guess we would pun it.
01:20:34 I have a system,
01:20:35 I mean, if anything gets on my hands,
01:20:37 I'm wiping it off.
01:20:38 I always have a towel next to my desk
01:20:39 at all times for anything
01:20:41 on my face and hands,
01:20:43 or just dripping.
01:20:45 But like, when I,
01:20:47 I basically just wash my hands
01:20:49 under two circumstances.
01:20:51 I just took a shit,
01:20:52 or I just jacked off.
01:20:54 Those are the two absolute
01:20:56 wash hands with soap circumstances.
01:20:59 You know what,
01:21:00 it's going to be real with you guys.
01:21:01 To me, jacking off is not a hand washing activity.
01:21:04 If you take a shower that day,
01:21:06 if you've taken a shower within like
01:21:08 20 or so hours,
01:21:09 then jack off,
01:21:11 you don't have to wash your hands.
01:21:12 If I was a good boy,
01:21:14 I would wash my hands after jacking off,
01:21:16 but I'm big enough to admit
01:21:18 that I'm not that boy.
01:21:20 Nate, how are you not grossed out by that,
01:21:22 but you all grossed out by me
01:21:24 wiping my boogers with my hands?
01:21:26 Ew, boogers are gross!
01:21:28 A man's seed,
01:21:30 a man's seed is pure hippo.
01:21:32 A man's seed should be celebrated.
01:21:34 It's the same stickers.
01:21:36 I don't get any like,
01:21:38 jizz on my hands when I jack off.
01:21:40 Right, yeah, that's the thing.
01:21:42 But just the smell of my dick
01:21:44 like gets on my hand
01:21:46 and it does not get off.
01:21:48 Like, I can smell my hand
01:21:50 from the full length of my arm away
01:21:52 for like hours
01:21:54 if I don't wash my hand after jacking off.
01:21:56 I would probably go longer
01:21:58 I would probably go longer without showering
01:22:00 if it weren't for the fact that
01:22:02 my dick starts to smell.
01:22:04 I just want the audience to know,
01:22:06 if you shake my hand, I just jacked off.
01:22:08 I remember fucking vividly
01:22:10 the first time
01:22:12 I ever like came in my pants
01:22:14 like after a wet drain
01:22:16 and I had to touch
01:22:18 my weenus penis
01:22:20 and feel the
01:22:22 straight up slime
01:22:24 Slime, straight up slime, dude.
01:22:26 Yeah.
01:22:28 I definitely have
01:22:30 I've seen a bunch of you knew that sex was a sin
01:22:32 and to never, you know, go back.
01:22:34 I guess I have a pretty high tolerance
01:22:36 to jizz just because
01:22:38 the way that I jacked off for several years
01:22:40 was entirely by laying on my belly
01:22:42 and doing it in my pants every time.
01:22:44 So I guess my tolerance is kind of weird.
01:22:46 In all my favorite RPGs
01:22:48 I always stack high jizz resistance.
01:22:50 High jizz defense.
01:22:52 Yeah, so I definitely have a hierarchy
01:22:54 of bodily fluids resistance.
01:22:56 Yeah, like cum, I really
01:22:58 don't mind that much.
01:23:00 I think it's pure, man.
01:23:02 Well, the first day I live.
01:23:04 I do because it sticks to everything
01:23:06 and it gets in your hairs and then it's
01:23:08 like impossible to get out once it dries.
01:23:10 I made out with a girl after just coming in her mouth
01:23:12 so at this point, you know,
01:23:14 she swallowed, right?
01:23:16 She swallowed first.
01:23:18 She swallowed first.
01:23:20 I'm a big snowballer.
01:23:22 You know me.
01:23:24 The first day I lived here
01:23:26 I just like sat down
01:23:28 on Digi's bed.
01:23:30 I was like kind of like laying down on Digi's bed
01:23:32 and he's like, just know I rub my dick
01:23:34 on every square centimeter
01:23:36 of that bed. I don't really mind.
01:23:38 I don't really mind dicks that much.
01:23:40 And then like pee, you know,
01:23:42 I'll compromise if need be.
01:23:44 That's the first step to being gay to boo, just so you know.
01:23:46 I don't mind cum so much at all.
01:23:48 So much for snakes.
01:23:50 He just said pee was next.
01:23:52 I got a bro, he just needs to get jacked off.
01:23:54 You know, it just had to be done.
01:23:56 It's not gay, it's just helping a friend out.
01:23:58 Leading up to moving in with Digi, right?
01:24:00 I'd seen what his toilet looked like.
01:24:02 I knew it was very, you know, pistuous.
01:24:04 But then when I finally saw it
01:24:06 When I finally saw it
01:24:08 Hashtag pistuous!
01:24:10 It was P-I-S-T-O-U-S
01:24:12 Where does T-O-U-S?
01:24:14 T-U-O-S
01:24:16 I finally saw it because it's just that like
01:24:18 The entire
01:24:20 two foot radius of around his toilet
01:24:22 is a layer of pee.
01:24:24 I wanted to get into that.
01:24:26 That's what I've been waiting for.
01:24:28 But we've been so far down this fucking rabbit hole
01:24:30 that we've been only focused on
01:24:32 like self hygiene.
01:24:34 But what about your environment?
01:24:36 Exactly, I have a huge thing about and nose about that.
01:24:38 Oh my god.
01:24:40 Can I just mention the story
01:24:42 at Radcon 2
01:24:44 when I got fed up with the environment
01:24:46 and insisted that we all clean.
01:24:48 I mean I was going to do it myself
01:24:50 but other people felt guilty and joined in
01:24:52 I didn't feel guilty. I just felt like it was a good idea.
01:24:54 I felt like Tom felt guilty, you know?
01:24:56 I guess I'm basing it off of him.
01:24:58 The best fucking moment of my entire fucking life
01:25:00 was when I pissed on Digi's house.
01:25:02 When was that?
01:25:04 It was so fucking good.
01:25:06 When I went outside and I just got to piss on the walls
01:25:08 and I just got to piss on the grass
01:25:10 it was so fucking
01:25:12 Yes Queen!
01:25:14 Yes Queen!
01:25:16 I pissed in my yard at least once a day
01:25:18 if not multiple times a day.
01:25:20 Yeah.
01:25:22 When I lived in my parents' house
01:25:24 I loved peeing outside. Peeing outside is great.
01:25:26 Me and Ben do it all the time
01:25:28 because we go out to smoke and each one of us
01:25:30 will just go out behind the bushes and be like
01:25:32 I'm going to go piss.
01:25:34 I'm a big peer. If I'm outside
01:25:36 there's a good chance I'm going to have to pee
01:25:38 and I'm not going all the way back inside.
01:25:40 It feels amazing to piss outside.
01:25:42 It does.
01:25:44 This was meant to be given to God before God
01:25:46 out in the open.
01:25:48 I wouldn't be okay with it if not for the fact
01:25:50 you don't have any toilet paper to deal with
01:25:52 some drips.
01:25:54 I was shaking off dude.
01:25:56 It was a leaf all over my body.
01:25:58 Yeah that's the thing.
01:26:00 I don't get much pee drip honestly.
01:26:02 Maybe I'm just blessed.
01:26:04 Well I have an extremely long foreskin
01:26:06 and therefore
01:26:08 I get flung all over the place
01:26:10 which is why my bathroom is entirely
01:26:12 covered in piss.
01:26:14 And the reason that I don't like...
01:26:16 Wait you don't peel it back?
01:26:18 You don't understand how long it is.
01:26:20 It's abnormal. Is it like a meter?
01:26:22 Yes it's exactly like that.
01:26:24 It's basically the equivalent
01:26:26 it's a man equivalent of beef curtains
01:26:28 holding on the end of it.
01:26:30 Yeah it's a beef curtain.
01:26:32 I'm not even joking.
01:26:34 I have an exceedingly long foreskin.
01:26:36 It's a condition called femorsis.
01:26:38 And even then I have an extreme example of it.
01:26:40 Oh yeah.
01:26:42 So yeah that's why in order to get the piss
01:26:44 out of my dick I have to like shake it violently
01:26:46 and it just gets everywhere.
01:26:48 People look at my toilet and will think
01:26:50 this is such a huge build up.
01:26:52 But like it gets that way after
01:26:54 a couple weeks.
01:26:56 That is why I did you.
01:26:58 You have to clean every single time.
01:27:00 Every single time.
01:27:02 You do a little bit.
01:27:04 I'm talking like if you stand.
01:27:06 If you stand.
01:27:08 If you use his toilet and you're standing up
01:27:10 because you're male right.
01:27:12 Any woman has ever gone into his room ever.
01:27:14 That's not true.
01:27:16 Sheepovers had to use that bathroom.
01:27:18 Oh you did that to sheepover?
01:27:20 That's a sin.
01:27:22 So if you stand there.
01:27:24 Whether or not you stand on it or sit on it
01:27:26 you're going to put your feet by the toilet.
01:27:28 There will be now crusted like caramelized pee
01:27:30 on your feet now.
01:27:32 It's not just pee.
01:27:34 The whole floor.
01:27:36 The entire floor of my bathroom is sticky
01:27:38 and it's not just because of piss.
01:27:40 I don't know what else it is.
01:27:42 It definitely leaves me with a disturbing feeling.
01:27:44 I'm just going to use one word to describe the experience
01:27:46 of your bathroom.
01:27:48 The only reason to bother you is because you don't wear socks.
01:27:50 I want to get to the feet situation.
01:27:52 Ditchy's bathroom is like a silent hill.
01:27:54 It is a nightmare.
01:27:56 It was legitimately terrified
01:27:58 the first time I went in.
01:28:00 I mostly use it at night
01:28:02 where I don't notice as much
01:28:04 but when I see it in the light of day
01:28:06 it is definitely horrifying.
01:28:08 It's a war zone.
01:28:10 I have a very specific foot
01:28:12 policy
01:28:14 which I am not able to fulfill
01:28:16 but when I have my own place
01:28:18 hopefully I'm going to get it figured out
01:28:20 which basically is just
01:28:22 I just want to avoid things
01:28:24 that cause bad germs.
01:28:26 Stuff like mold
01:28:28 and mildew.
01:28:30 Like bodily fluids past the giz level.
01:28:32 That kind of stuff.
01:28:34 Not too many foreign substances.
01:28:36 Nothing is past the giz level for me.
01:28:38 Other than maybe...
01:28:40 Are you talking about bloods?
01:28:42 He just considers giz
01:28:44 to be the least offensive bodily fluid
01:28:46 whereas I would consider it to be the most offensive
01:28:48 other than shit.
01:28:50 It propagates life and you oppose life.
01:28:52 I am in favor of life.
01:28:54 That's right.
01:28:56 Because it's a sticky, disgusting substance
01:28:58 that permanently gets on everything.
01:29:00 And it smells, dude.
01:29:02 It smells.
01:29:04 I'm not saying...
01:29:06 I've never seen that.
01:29:08 If you ever giz
01:29:10 and then don't clean it up
01:29:12 watch it for a couple days.
01:29:14 No thank you.
01:29:16 I'm not saying I don't clean it up.
01:29:18 I'm not saying I don't mind it.
01:29:20 I do mind it. It's just the lowest rank
01:29:22 and I will clean it up.
01:29:24 The idea is just have a whole environment
01:29:26 that is clean
01:29:28 and have your feet exist
01:29:30 and you can walk around and you don't have to worry about it.
01:29:32 See, I started developing this policy
01:29:34 because my family started getting dogs.
01:29:36 Right?
01:29:38 We got to the point where we had two dogs at a time
01:29:40 and it was just gross because dogs are disgusting
01:29:42 and I despise everything about them.
01:29:44 And they're just gross and terrible
01:29:46 and they shit and they pee
01:29:48 and they also will lick the floor.
01:29:50 They'll lick fucking food on the floor
01:29:52 and it's five times worse if it's a dog.
01:29:54 Undertale
01:29:56 is an 8.7 out of 10
01:29:58 because it has dog residue in the game.
01:30:00 It would be a 10 otherwise.
01:30:02 So I started wearing slippers
01:30:04 and then when I go into my room
01:30:06 I take the slippers off right outside of the bedroom.
01:30:08 It was a strict fucking policy
01:30:10 for me to never have my bare feet
01:30:12 around because there's dogs around.
01:30:14 So the problem with this house
01:30:16 is that there are so many people that have
01:30:18 a different policy
01:30:20 and it seems to be more like
01:30:22 it's okay to have fucking stuff on the floor
01:30:24 just have socks on all the time.
01:30:26 We have mostly hardwood floors
01:30:28 in this house
01:30:30 or different stuff
01:30:32 and it's just physically
01:30:34 impossible to keep them clean
01:30:36 for more than one minute.
01:30:38 There's just stuff you can't even see
01:30:40 that will get stuck to your foot
01:30:42 and personally I freak the fuck out
01:30:44 if anything is on my feet at all.
01:30:46 With the second something touches my foot
01:30:48 and I have to get rid of it.
01:30:50 So I wear socks at all times
01:30:52 if I'm looking around the house
01:30:54 sometimes socks and slippers
01:30:56 because I would just wear slippers
01:30:58 but I have a condition called
01:31:00 my feet sweat like hell
01:31:02 and if I wear anything without socks
01:31:04 I will destroy it
01:31:06 immediately.
01:31:08 I've had pairs of slippers
01:31:10 that literally fell apart within a week
01:31:12 because the strength of my foot sweat destroyed them.
01:31:14 Fuck.
01:31:16 It's really weird Digi.
01:31:18 I actually have
01:31:20 very weirdly dry feet
01:31:22 to the point like it's like a mummy.
01:31:24 I have mummy feet.
01:31:26 Do you have to moisturize them?
01:31:28 Yeah, I have to moisturize them.
01:31:30 My feet are fucking white.
01:31:32 I think that might be an ethnic thing.
01:31:34 I think you might have ethnic feet.
01:31:36 I have dangerously ethnic feet.
01:31:38 It's the name of a new podcast
01:31:40 by the way coming down.
01:31:42 I want to say that
01:31:44 that's the other reason I wear socks
01:31:46 because I don't want to look at feet.
01:31:48 I love walking
01:31:50 outside barefoot
01:31:52 on hot tarmac roads
01:31:54 and stuff.
01:31:56 I used to as a kid walk
01:31:58 on rocks and hot sand at the beach
01:32:00 barefoot and I just love
01:32:02 walking on
01:32:04 like a bumpy, really
01:32:06 searing hot tarmac road
01:32:08 for some reason it's just really pleasurable
01:32:10 and I enjoy it.
01:32:12 I love walking on gravel
01:32:14 and Legos and all that sort of stuff.
01:32:16 It has to be really fucking cold
01:32:18 to convince me to wear socks.
01:32:20 Only in the dead of winter
01:32:22 am I finally cold enough on the feet
01:32:24 to wear socks because it's just uncomfortable.
01:32:26 I'll wear socks in
01:32:28 I'll wear socks with my sandals
01:32:30 in the 100 degree weather
01:32:32 like socks are just
01:32:34 necessary to make things
01:32:36 not gross.
01:32:38 But yeah, to get back to the environment
01:32:40 like aside from my bathroom
01:32:42 my whole room is filthy
01:32:44 like in terms of
01:32:46 the daylight is hitting my desk
01:32:48 right now and there's just
01:32:50 there's just flakes
01:32:52 everywhere.
01:32:54 Who knows what this is all about.
01:32:56 It's dust.
01:32:58 A lot of it's probably skin
01:33:00 a lot of it's probably food
01:33:02 a lot of it's probably just whatever
01:33:04 is floating in the environment
01:33:06 it's just
01:33:08 has a thin veneer of bullshit
01:33:10 on it in my room.
01:33:12 There's nothing that's just clean.
01:33:14 If you took all the dust in my room
01:33:16 and then like compiled it together
01:33:18 it would be like at least a hamburger
01:33:20 or maybe even two.
01:33:22 It's fucking dust.
01:33:24 There's a ton of
01:33:26 fucking burger juice around me.
01:33:28 It's fucking gross.
01:33:30 It's all covered in fucking snow.
01:33:32 Do you actually wipe it down?
01:33:34 I do.
01:33:36 You see my kitchen it is immaculate right now
01:33:38 it looks great.
01:33:40 My work area I'm less particular about keeping it clean
01:33:42 but I do make sure that
01:33:44 the services are never sticky
01:33:46 and I wipe it down occasionally.
01:33:48 I'm not really concerned about clutter
01:33:50 all I can't deal with is
01:33:52 if there's like shit like gross shit
01:33:54 I gotta deal with that.
01:33:56 The funniest shit is that on my keyboard
01:33:58 all of the keys that I actually
01:34:00 use are like
01:34:02 black as they should be
01:34:04 from the grease of my fingers
01:34:06 So mostly the letters
01:34:08 N-I-G-E-R
01:34:10 They see a lot of use right?
01:34:12 But then all of the F keys
01:34:14 and the number keys and the home insert
01:34:16 are just caked in filth
01:34:18 You can't even read them
01:34:20 because there's so much shit on them
01:34:22 My old laptop used to be caked
01:34:24 the buttons used to be caked
01:34:26 It was horrible.
01:34:28 I scraped it off with a screwdriver
01:34:30 At the very top of the keyboard
01:34:32 with the extra buttons and stuff
01:34:34 All of them are caked except for the volume up
01:34:36 and volume down which have a little halo
01:34:38 of beautiful pristinness around them
01:34:40 because I press them constantly
01:34:42 I use them all the time
01:34:44 Everything else is horribly filthy except for those buttons
01:34:46 So yeah, you can immediately
01:34:48 at first glance
01:34:50 tell what buttons I press on this keyboard
01:34:52 because all the ones I don't are like
01:34:54 It's fucking horrible
01:34:56 Does anyone else do the thing
01:34:58 where they take the keyboard and shake it upside down?
01:35:00 I do that very regularly
01:35:02 Sometimes nothing comes out
01:35:04 and I'm like, yes
01:35:06 For me, dealing with the keyboard
01:35:08 Oh god, my mouse looks fucking
01:35:10 like there's so much
01:35:12 just gunk on my mouse
01:35:14 from my greasy hands
01:35:16 I try to clean my mouse fairly regularly
01:35:18 but it just built
01:35:20 I don't even think about it and then I look at it
01:35:22 I usually have to start cleaning it off
01:35:24 when it actually gets so caked up on the bottom
01:35:26 that I can't move it correctly
01:35:28 Yeah, that happens
01:35:34 I wanted to raise
01:35:36 a different issue
01:35:38 to all of this stuff
01:35:40 because we've been talking about hygiene
01:35:42 in the context of the real world
01:35:44 and the social standards
01:35:46 that we're generally used to
01:35:48 but I wanted to just
01:35:50 I had a whole different way of looking at it
01:35:52 based on one word
01:35:54 and that word is pheromones
01:35:56 If there is any reason to actually be
01:35:58 worried as a society
01:36:00 if we should shift our thinking
01:36:02 to fuck all this hygiene shit
01:36:04 embrace the fact that we're gross
01:36:06 and we get oil on everything
01:36:08 and that we're just animals and shit
01:36:10 because I'm worried
01:36:12 that I'm repressing my raw sexual energy
01:36:14 by not getting my stank out there
01:36:16 via pheromone
01:36:18 or my pheromones out there via stank
01:36:20 and my sexual prowess is being hampered
01:36:22 by not being able to
01:36:24 as a species, we've come to
01:36:26 enjoy the feeling of being very clean
01:36:28 so I don't think that's going to change
01:36:30 I prefer being clean
01:36:32 to being gross
01:36:34 but I know what being gross is like
01:36:38 I feel like people when pressed
01:36:40 are eager to embrace
01:36:42 hygiene and celebrate it
01:36:44 but I think that
01:36:46 almost everyone is nastier than they admit
01:36:48 that B, because we all
01:36:50 have different hygiene standards
01:36:52 and all of us are nasty about something
01:36:54 the other person doesn't think is nasty
01:36:56 like DeVu not thinking comes a big deal
01:36:58 whereas I think it's a
01:37:00 totally gross and DeVu thinking
01:37:02 that my bathroom being completely covered
01:37:04 and piss is gross when I also agree
01:37:06 that it's disgusting
01:37:08 I really fucking hate this piss
01:37:10 shaming going around
01:37:12 I just think that
01:37:14 when it comes down to it
01:37:16 most of us don't care
01:37:18 that much
01:37:20 it's one thing when you're trying to be like
01:37:22 oh I'm out on the prowl
01:37:24 trying to pick up chicks
01:37:26 I'm going to try to look smooth
01:37:28 and confident and stuff
01:37:30 but it's like when you actually have a girlfriend
01:37:32 you probably spend a lot of time with the two of you
01:37:34 you fucked 12 times in the same day
01:37:36 you're both literally disgusting
01:37:38 you are at the worst grossest you will ever be
01:37:40 and that's just natural
01:37:42 that's a natural state of being
01:37:44 to just be covered in your own filth
01:37:46 it's fucking natural
01:37:48 you don't have to bring to piss
01:37:50 piss isn't anything to be ashamed of
01:37:52 it's a thing to be celebrating
01:37:54 what makes the world go round
01:37:56 piss is the only thing that I fucking live for
01:37:58 in my entire life
01:38:00 it's the only reason I work for the money
01:38:02 why I even come on this podcast
01:38:04 it's the only thing I want to do with my fucking time
01:38:06 I feel it in my ears
01:38:08 it's the only thing that I want to believe in
01:38:10 now that's a munchy piss
01:38:12 yeah he's got a lot more piss now
01:38:14 but he did last time
01:38:16 that's an impressive
01:38:18 were you like chugging waters this whole time
01:38:20 all of my DNA is piss
01:38:22 that's all it is
01:38:24 press one for piss
01:38:26 munchy how much did you drink
01:38:28 in the course of this
01:38:30 I just want to fucking live in piss
01:38:32 that's all I want to do
01:38:34 I just want to continue being a piss boy
01:38:36 that's all I fucking want to do
01:38:38 I just want to become a piss guy
01:38:40 I think this is a good time to take some
01:38:42 reader questions
01:38:44 we'll just let him
01:38:46 we'll just let the sound of munchy's piss just be background noise
01:38:48 is it still going
01:38:50 it can't be
01:38:52 well with that
01:38:54 let's address at ken cray
01:38:56 crayley
01:38:58 yeah okay ken crayley
01:39:00 yeah okay he asks

01:39:22 tell her that she's young
01:39:24 and that you have sex with the young
01:39:26 munchy literally what did you drink

01:39:32 to have that much piss

01:39:36 but he pissed right at the start of the show
01:39:38 yeah he did
01:39:40 all I fucking do is

01:39:56 I'll just drink a johnny walker
01:39:58 and then my fourth harvest
01:40:00 after I pissed it out and drank it back again
01:40:02 that's what I'm drinking right now
01:40:04 I'm honestly on my fifth harvest right now
01:40:06 it's getting pretty up there
01:40:08 let's move on to our next question
01:40:10 I'm so fucking pissed right now
01:40:12 the procrastinator's podcast is going to develop
01:40:14 a reputation as the podcast

01:40:54 it's not worth it
01:40:56 oh man you know what um

01:41:00 and you know exactly what we're gonna get out of
01:41:02 have a plan find the most efficient way
01:41:04 if that involves college then do it
01:41:06 but if not then don't
01:41:08 yeah do you know what my cousin patricia the pleb said

01:41:22 she played fucking second life for like years
01:41:24 that's a mistake
01:41:26 that's all you had to say
01:41:28 that's all you had to say
01:41:30 that's all you had to say
01:41:32 is it normal for your piss to be like
01:41:34 boiling
01:41:36 usually
01:41:38 that would mean that you haven't
01:41:40 you haven't been hydrated well
01:41:42 it's like
01:41:44 if your piss boils
01:41:46 I feel like it is top ramen juice
01:41:48 without the noodles
01:41:50 oh no
01:41:52 that's salty dude
01:41:54 what question was I gonna ask you before the show
01:41:56 oh yeah tell us the story of you going to the
01:41:58 fucking museum place
01:42:00 oh yeah
01:42:02 if you go to my twitter
01:42:04 bestest guy ever
01:42:06 I tweeted a bunch of shit today
01:42:08 oh my god that picture with the lady
01:42:10 today
01:42:12 April 15th 2017
01:42:14 go back to that day
01:42:16 go to that day and look at my shit
01:42:18 so I was at the creationist museum
01:42:22 so my parents are in town
01:42:24 they were just coming for a visit
01:42:26 and then they were just looking for
01:42:28 shit to do and one of the things
01:42:30 that was like suggested
01:42:32 to my mom which is like at the hotel or something
01:42:34 was doing ziplines and so the place they were
01:42:36 signing up for didn't have any available
01:42:38 so we were just like hey well that sounds like a cool idea
01:42:40 let's see if there's another one nearby
01:42:42 and the second one was this it was called like
01:42:44 scream and raptor ziplines
01:42:46 and we're like okay that sounds cool
01:42:48 so we get there and we realize it's
01:42:50 the fucking creationist museum
01:42:52 I had no idea such a thing existed
01:42:54 I've heard about it a lot over the years
01:42:56 I listened to a bunch of fucking atheist shit
01:42:58 because that's all I think about I much hate fucking god
01:43:00 so I get there and
01:43:02 you just
01:43:04 you just choose to hate him
01:43:06 that's the atheist position
01:43:08 we know he's real we're just mad at him
01:43:10 when you go there do they just hand you
01:43:12 a flyer that just says
01:43:14 carbon dating what
01:43:16 dude the thing about this that was most
01:43:18 fascinating was that the place was covered
01:43:20 in dinosaurs it was like
01:43:22 mostly dinosaur themed
01:43:24 right I couldn't like we didn't buy tickets
01:43:26 to go inside to see any of the
01:43:28 indoor exhibits and shit but I've seen
01:43:30 like pictures because this place is famous
01:43:32 I know they have pictures of like cavemen
01:43:34 hanging out with dinosaurs in that place
01:43:36 obviously it's fucking fascinating
01:43:38 you know because it's like
01:43:40 the humans live together with dinosaurs
01:43:42 on Atlantis I mean before Atlantis
01:43:44 or El and the Mars came
01:43:46 they were hanging out with the necals
01:43:48 I'm pretty sure like four out of five necals
01:43:50 were raptors
01:43:52 let me just clarify right they based
01:43:54 the zipline technology on the necol
01:43:56 technology that's right just so you people know
01:43:58 the creations zipline technology
01:44:00 brought to us from
01:44:02 fucking Mars
01:44:04 just so you know
01:44:06 people the creations museum just to clarify
01:44:08 it is a Christian
01:44:10 biblical like Genesis origin
01:44:12 museum like evidence for
01:44:14 why Genesis is true and accurate
01:44:16 fucking yes like this is a six thousand
01:44:18 years old thing and they like
01:44:20 and
01:44:22 a model of the
01:44:24 like life-sized model of a room on Noah's
01:44:26 Ark that you were at
01:44:28 yeah and that's like
01:44:30 check it out guys we remade
01:44:32 one of the like hundred and sixty six rooms
01:44:34 that was in Noah's Ark
01:44:36 here's the Bible passage that talks about it
01:44:38 here's and this is it this is what
01:44:40 Noah was dealing with when he packed literally
01:44:42 two of every animal onto this Ark
01:44:44 everyone else in the world was killed by God
01:44:46 and he and his family single-handedly restarted
01:44:48 humanity yeah and every other animal
01:44:50 is there a big display all about the
01:44:52 is there all a big display like about the continental
01:44:54 drift and it was like after Noah
01:44:56 continental drift really got its head out of its
01:44:58 ass and made Australia
01:45:00 that's why
01:45:04 not at that part now if I worked for the
01:45:06 creationist museum I know and I worked to like
01:45:08 design a set I know what I do because
01:45:10 it'd be based off of a really good creationist
01:45:12 argument I once heard so this would be
01:45:14 the display there'd be the
01:45:16 the skeleton of like a Chihuahua
01:45:18 and it'd be like uh-huh look at this
01:45:20 Chihuahua you know we you know
01:45:22 using our top scientists you know we can guess
01:45:24 it was like 500 million years ago 700 million
01:45:26 years ago we just make guesses we scientists
01:45:28 we know what we're doing right you know
01:45:30 the fact that meteorologists can't predict the
01:45:32 weather within the next week but they all know about
01:45:34 climate change and evolution sure sure we all
01:45:36 know that right lol then
01:45:38 then right next to it show the body
01:45:40 the skeleton of a great
01:45:42 Dane be like see now look at this
01:45:44 look look at how the Chihuahua
01:45:46 evolved into a great Dane over the course
01:45:48 of millions of years right because this is
01:45:50 hypothetical if this took place 50
01:45:52 million years in the future where all dogs were
01:45:54 extinct and all we had with the bones we'd be like
01:45:56 look see this evolution where this creature got
01:45:58 tall huh see that's evolution
01:46:00 right right guys huh
01:46:02 huh and then like when you leave that particular
01:46:04 place there's like there's like five people
01:46:06 who like rub their their elbows and you'd be
01:46:08 like huh you get it you get it see see
01:46:10 how that looks like evolution
01:46:12 I are you making an argument about how like
01:46:14 I know a lot of creationists make the micro
01:46:16 like they say of course my oh yeah
01:46:18 oh yeah it's like macro evolution
01:46:20 to say and that they're that there's things
01:46:22 that could be mistaken for yeah yeah
01:46:24 and that's evidence against oh man
01:46:26 oh my god oh my god yeah
01:46:28 the whole micro evolution thing is my favorite
01:46:30 argument and having a creationist dad I've gotten
01:46:32 to have a number of times this for like a
01:46:34 Christian well it's so short though it's
01:46:36 a really short debate right so it is
01:46:38 as follows but it's like well yeah I know
01:46:40 speciation where like
01:46:42 you know hair can grow in or shrink in
01:46:44 length and colors can change and I'm
01:46:46 like doesn't that shit stack
01:46:48 yeah and then he's dead he's
01:46:50 dead he's fucking dead it's the shortest
01:46:52 debate I've ever had in my life and yet
01:46:54 they I don't know they cling to it for whatever
01:46:56 but anyway well it's because it's the
01:46:58 species is defined by what you can breed
01:47:00 so even if you micro evolve
01:47:02 the whole fuck ton if you can still
01:47:04 breed with the original species then you
01:47:06 haven't become a new me I love that quote you did
01:47:08 cling to it they cling to their guns and
01:47:10 to their religion Pokemon go to the polls
01:47:12 that's that's that's why I voted for
01:47:14 Hilary got into this museum
01:47:16 and you took this amazing picture where
01:47:18 this this lady looks
01:47:20 really upset well hey let me let me
01:47:22 say there's a couple big yeah the first
01:47:24 one is is me like bowing
01:47:26 in awe of the creationist museum and then
01:47:28 the next one is me yeah so
01:47:30 like so I'm I want there's a dinosaur
01:47:32 there and before we left I wanted to get a picture
01:47:34 of it so my mother who I had
01:47:36 with me I had to her take the picture
01:47:38 by the way my parents are basically
01:47:40 non-religious for the most part I think
01:47:42 my dad believes in some spooky shit but he doesn't
01:47:44 really talk about that much so I don't really know
01:47:46 like we all made fun of this shit the whole time
01:47:48 yeah
01:47:50 the Holy Ghost
01:47:52 all the time this spooky shit
01:47:54 I don't want to get haunted by the Holy Ghost
01:47:56 dad dad dad
01:47:58 except the existence of the occasional
01:48:00 Babadook
01:48:02 yeah that's right
01:48:04 he was off of the bathroom and so I give my mom
01:48:06 this thing and I'm just like I just yelled at my mom
01:48:08 so I had just done the pose in front
01:48:10 of the in front of the thing like like looking
01:48:12 up at the sign in awe and
01:48:14 I was already yelling I'm just like yo ma
01:48:16 I'm gonna throw up some gang signs I say
01:48:18 just like that and I pose in front
01:48:20 of this dinosaur and the just the best thing
01:48:22 was that this this fucking family
01:48:24 was in the picture go go look at the
01:48:26 fucking tweets the best thing I've ever done
01:48:28 and she just she's so mad
01:48:30 she's so fucking mad
01:48:32 she's making a mockery
01:48:34 also you know what this is this is relevant
01:48:36 she was all because that family was black
01:48:38 right they should have like a black guy
01:48:40 who like works there is like yeah you know
01:48:42 when you think about it the theory of evolution
01:48:44 is essentially racist because it implies
01:48:46 that there was this evolution after black
01:48:48 people and white people are a higher
01:48:50 advanced state of evolution that white
01:48:52 people are the superior
01:48:54 races that's what we're talking about here
01:48:56 interesting interesting platform
01:48:58 you guys have yes yes
01:49:00 that's my platform for sure
01:49:02 that's what I was trying to communicate through this tweet
01:49:04 she definitely her face to me
01:49:06 says what the fuck
01:49:08 is this dude and like
01:49:10 her son next to her did also not look
01:49:12 too thrilled it looks to me like she's saying
01:49:14 is this nigga serious yeah it does look
01:49:16 like that like like Tommy like Tommy
01:49:18 and Chuckie I mean I
01:49:20 show of it I was sort of yelling to
01:49:22 people I was
01:49:24 sort of just mocking everybody there yeah
01:49:26 it was great it was super fun by the way those
01:49:28 were tight as fuck and there were
01:49:30 biblical scriptures like on the ziplines
01:49:32 like oh yeah
01:49:34 oh my god
01:49:36 god is god is my wings let him carry me
01:49:38 oh my god this fucking zipline
01:49:40 Exodus 102 from that shit
01:49:42 I don't know
01:49:44 every time you go down the zipline
01:49:46 one chakra aligns
01:49:48 in your body every
01:49:50 trip down the zipline increases your christ
01:49:52 consciousness by one dimension
01:49:54 yeah exactly but walking back
01:49:56 it takes it away
01:49:58 well you gotta find
01:50:00 like an infinite zipline that just keeps going down
01:50:02 at my max what do you think my christ consciousness
01:50:04 was elevated to just by being in proximity
01:50:06 of all this all these normally like like
01:50:08 normal people are at a two
01:50:10 baseline and and I'm
01:50:12 I would say that you like at your
01:50:14 height would honestly get to like
01:50:16 like a hard like five
01:50:18 or a or a or a light six
01:50:20 check those tweets I was
01:50:22 I was feeling I was feeling that crystal and energy
01:50:24 pulsating within me I could feel it
01:50:26 just check that like your blood
01:50:28 probably turned into crystals and like
01:50:30 hard and you can see the fucking Nicole
01:50:32 trying to teach you about stairs type evolution
01:50:34 fucking toad son probably
01:50:36 no toad son came down to the
01:50:38 creation museum and he was like
01:50:40 hey god hey bros doing good
01:50:42 shit I got from
01:50:44 god check it ziplines
01:50:46 and the creation museum
01:50:48 god's real we knew it
01:50:50 got that fucking stairs
01:50:52 evolution motherfucker
01:50:54 and
01:50:56 that's the story
01:50:58 my christ consciousness is not high enough
01:51:00 level to understand what's going on here
01:51:02 yeah you can't even process that shit
01:51:04 yeah we got a couple more here's one
01:51:06 jenny's at jenny's
01:51:08 maku domaru maku domaru
01:51:10 this guy tweets us all the time
01:51:12 says what's up with the hacking
01:51:14 these days
01:51:16 there's trouble with that shit
01:51:18 there's this hacker group called
01:51:20 ourmine
01:51:22 they've got their own wikipedia article and everything
01:51:24 they've hacked everybody in the world
01:51:26 apparently lots of famous
01:51:28 people and shit and now they've
01:51:30 been hacking into youtube
01:51:32 networks and just getting access to
01:51:34 all their channels and changing the
01:51:36 titles and descriptions on the videos
01:51:38 just to advertise themselves
01:51:40 I think they're probably selling something
01:51:42 but you know what they're selling
01:51:44 they're selling like anti piracy
01:51:46 shit like anti
01:51:48 that's being able to hack you
01:51:50 software but uh
01:51:52 they just so happened to
01:51:54 hack the network studio
01:51:56 71 like three days
01:51:58 after I joined that studio
01:52:00 after like four years of not
01:52:02 having joined a network so
01:52:04 get fuck dude
01:52:06 are you staying with that those guys
01:52:08 for now I mean
01:52:10 I signed a contract with them but
01:52:12 the thing about it is that they're
01:52:14 I'll talk about this at a later date
01:52:16 sure but the thing about it is that they're
01:52:18 not exactly a network
01:52:20 they're more of a talent agency that
01:52:22 has a network so that's
01:52:24 why I'm working with them but uh
01:52:26 you know I'll get into that later when I've got
01:52:28 more to say about it
01:52:30 I almost
01:52:32 I got a vibe okay
01:52:34 yesterday I spent the better half
01:52:36 of my afternoon pissing my pants
01:52:38 because I was
01:52:40 I had actually
01:52:42 it's an all day affair
01:52:44 I
01:52:46 I was on google
01:52:48 and this isn't a fucking joke
01:52:50 I was typing in what causes
01:52:52 autism
01:52:54 and I
01:52:56 it's not a joke
01:52:58 oh god
01:53:00 and I clicked the first link
01:53:02 and I went to a page
01:53:04 like I have
01:53:06 since done this on other devices and it doesn't go
01:53:08 to the page that I clicked on so I literally think
01:53:10 it's an autism ghost
01:53:12 page that I found
01:53:14 and I clicked on like I took I clicked on a link
01:53:16 and took me to like this weird like this
01:53:18 weird like obvious porn ad and it was
01:53:20 like a booming face came over and it was like
01:53:22 uh I am from
01:53:24 Microsoft you have been hacked
01:53:26 please dial the snobber
01:53:28 and I'll fucking fix your shit dude promise
01:53:30 and I was like oh I'm
01:53:32 scared of things so I
01:53:34 I close I close
01:53:36 my firefox and I didn't I didn't want to have
01:53:38 anything to do with it but
01:53:40 here's the thing the voice
01:53:42 kept going after I closed
01:53:44 firefox oh no
01:53:46 fuck yeah
01:53:48 they're in the walls now dude
01:53:50 exactly exactly so I
01:53:52 immediately piss and shit my pants
01:53:54 me too
01:53:56 it's a defense mechanism
01:53:58 it's self defense
01:54:00 self defense
01:54:02 no one's gonna want to hack me if I pissed myself
01:54:04 they will be so I called
01:54:06 my friend and I literally just started
01:54:08 trying him like you have to help me
01:54:10 and he's like okay and then and then
01:54:12 like he like the entire time he's like
01:54:14 this is just this isn't real Islamic ghost
01:54:16 yeah yeah I was just about to say this isn't real
01:54:18 Islamic ghost and then like like he gets
01:54:20 like some software to me and like like I run
01:54:22 like like like some like antivirus thing
01:54:24 and I literally like find like some like
01:54:26 backdoor like like like like trojan
01:54:28 horse shit that's like been backdoor
01:54:30 my information and and now like
01:54:32 apparent like like I probably have like
01:54:34 like all my files are on some like
01:54:36 like your wizards database but but I got rid
01:54:38 of that I up and
01:54:40 I know all the munchies secrets
01:54:42 yeah exactly
01:54:44 all because I wanted to know what caused
01:54:46 autism
01:54:48 autism you know I think we if we
01:54:50 could find if we can find pinpoint
01:54:52 if we can use our fucking crystalline
01:54:54 sensor technology to find the one place on the planet
01:54:56 where some persons Christ consciousness has
01:54:58 spiked to unbelievable level
01:55:00 we'll know who has munchies secrets
01:55:02 we'll know where he is
01:55:04 we'll never find out what causes autism
01:55:06 no
01:55:08 he never found out
01:55:10 that's the greatest crime of all
01:55:12 oh tragic
01:55:14 this is like a superfine version too
01:55:16 like the entire time I had to jump through hoops
01:55:18 I had to download a whole bunch of shit
01:55:20 and the entire time
01:55:22 a couple times my computer just
01:55:24 shut off at random
01:55:26 and I relate this to my
01:55:28 friend and this is
01:55:30 my greatest fear
01:55:32 at one time Nate talked about how like
01:55:34 if he had a runny nose and he couldn't breathe
01:55:36 baby shit
01:55:38 here is the greatest fear
01:55:40 I could possibly have not a fucking joke
01:55:42 I get a virus
01:55:44 and then I'm like I'm going about my day
01:55:46 I'm just going about like doing whatever
01:55:48 playing games I have a virus
01:55:50 it's dormant and then like
01:55:52 a pop-up window happens and like
01:55:54 some dude just starts laughing at me and it's like
01:55:56 I'm in the computer bitch
01:55:58 and then he's like he just starts laughing at me
01:56:00 like I don't know what to do because he's
01:56:02 complete control of my computer and then he just starts going
01:56:04 to like gore websites and he's like you like this
01:56:06 huh this is what you like
01:56:08 and I'm like no it's not
01:56:10 it's not what I like
01:56:14 that's the worst thing
01:56:16 that's all I could think about when I was trying to
01:56:18 get the virus off my computer
01:56:20 it's like a black guy is going to show up and he's going to make me see gore
01:56:22 he's going to make me see gore
01:56:24 I think something similar
01:56:26 I mean I haven't like had my computer
01:56:28 completely taken over but there was this one time
01:56:30 when I got a virus and it changed
01:56:32 my desktop background and it would not stop
01:56:34 playing music and I couldn't
01:56:36 do anything so I had to reformat the whole
01:56:38 hard drive I think I was like 12
01:56:40 I remember one time when I was a kid
01:56:42 I was like wondering to myself is it possible
01:56:44 just possible like theoretically
01:56:46 to have a virus that just overloads
01:56:48 the wires and like
01:56:50 mechanizes them and like turn and like
01:56:52 all the wires and fucking systems
01:56:54 they start flapping around in there
01:56:56 making a huge noise and they turn into like a little RC
01:56:58 helicopter or a little drone
01:57:00 that busts out of your case
01:57:02 and stabs the shit out of you
01:57:04 that's basically possible in that show
01:57:08 fucking computers are terrifying
01:57:10 I want more questions man these are good questions
01:57:12 we got two more yeah these were pretty good
01:57:14 I went through the whole list ahead of time and found the best ones
01:57:16 okay here we go
01:57:18 at Zana J
01:57:20 it's like x-i-n-i-j-e I don't know how to pronounce this shit
01:57:22 okay this person has some very important questions
01:57:24 guys jesus man
01:57:26 yeah I don't know man this person
01:57:28 asked what would you do
01:57:30 to punish Ben St.'s crimes against humanity
01:57:32 I assume
01:57:34 this is a good question
01:57:36 it's gotta come up at some point
01:57:38 is it
01:57:40 Ben's Crimes Against Polk?
01:57:42 that's what I was wondering
01:57:44 I would make Ben take a public shit
01:57:46 no
01:57:48 I can't even take a private shit
01:57:50 without running the water so no one can hear it
01:57:52 exactly
01:57:54 we gotta have a toilet
01:57:56 up on a podium in the middle of town
01:57:58 square and he has to take a public shit
01:58:00 I'm just saying
01:58:02 that's one step up from a group shit
01:58:04 that's like a public shit
01:58:06 we should do a group public shit
01:58:10 I'm imagining
01:58:12 I'm on murderers
01:58:14 row
01:58:16 I'm being walked to the gallows and the whole PCP
01:58:18 is prodding me along
01:58:20 and they walk me up a big ramp
01:58:22 up to the top of a statue
01:58:24 in town square and I squat down
01:58:26 and I'm just like weeping
01:58:28 the tears are flowing
01:58:30 and I'm like I can't do it
01:58:32 and then just
01:58:34 munchy comes
01:58:36 and squats down next to me in solidarity
01:58:38 and then everyone looks at each other
01:58:40 everyone looks at each other
01:58:42 and they all come and squat next to me
01:58:44 and the tears just get even stronger
01:58:46 and I'm like I love you guys so much
01:58:48 and
01:58:50 I'm imagining this is like
01:58:52 a possibly tall statue
01:58:54 and the people can barely hear us
01:58:56 but then people are like
01:58:58 shush shush shush we need to hear the shit
01:59:00 we need to hear the shit noises
01:59:02 and then it's like
01:59:04 Bahudorus the song from
01:59:06 the Grinch and then they hear from the top of the statue
01:59:08 and we're all singing like group poop
01:59:10 group poop
01:59:12 I imagine this
01:59:14 and passersby just behold
01:59:16 this miraculous spectacle with tears in their eyes
01:59:18 as shit as just particles of shit
01:59:20 and splatters just like come down
01:59:22 just rain down upon them
01:59:24 I think that's far too romantic of a possibility
01:59:26 I think more of that he gets the chair
01:59:28 and it's all dramatic and some fucking
01:59:30 some sort of like a new metal song
01:59:32 is playing over it like
01:59:34 into the ground
01:59:36 and his heart stops
01:59:38 then fucking Max revive
01:59:40 he busts out
01:59:42 he gets out
01:59:44 because you know the law says
01:59:46 according to the law
01:59:48 if you survive
01:59:50 the fucking execution then you're off free
01:59:52 apparently that's what I've heard
01:59:54 you're not punished to be killed
01:59:56 you're punished to have this thing happen to you
01:59:58 that kills you so like if it doesn't kill you
02:00:00 then you're fucking free
