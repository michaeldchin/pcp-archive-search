00:00:00 Hey guys, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Today we have a really funny thing to do for
00:00:11 you guys. So here we go. Here's the high octane action and lovable cast members that you've
00:00:17 all become accustomed to on this glorious podcast of ours, on this podcast that spans
00:00:24 C to Shining C. We have Hippocrit. Hey, it's me. Tom. Hey, it's me. So this is what we're
00:00:38 going to do. We're going to talk like this, which is our normal voice, and then every
00:00:43 once in a while, when we want to make a funny joke, then we'll just scream really loud.
00:00:48 And then that translates into us being happy and slash or energetic. And that will mean
00:00:54 that the show is better because energetic is better. It's not about having interesting
00:01:00 things to say. And when you're naturally passionate about a topic, then you will just get loud
00:01:06 because you have a lot of things to say. The raw volume is what determines the interest,
00:01:11 not the energy behind that volume. So just crank up your gain, and that's how you make
00:01:15 a good podcast. Speaking of which, today's topic is podcasts. That's what we're talking
00:01:22 about. Speaking of podcasts, last week, my intro was Topic Sky Committee, Rhymes with
00:01:28 Chitty. And that's my new topic here again. Nate's not here. Nate's not here. You may
00:01:34 have noticed Nate's not here. And when Nate's not here, everything falls apart. Everyone,
00:01:38 like their mind control ceases, like their eyes are turned normal from their all black
00:01:44 and red state. And they start looking around and they start to unbuckle their chance. And
00:01:48 they think, what the fuck am I doing here? So we're doing podcasts. A topic none of us
00:01:54 have any passion for or even know how to tackle. What can we talk about podcasts? Podcasts
00:01:59 that we like? Just go to like a list of podcasts that we like. Oh, that's really fucking funny.
00:02:03 Here, I'm going to do that for you. Revolutions. Hello, Internet. There you go. Those are the
00:02:08 two podcasts I listened to.
00:02:11 Fucking Cox and Crendoor. You know, podcasts, they're bad. And I don't like them. And this
00:02:19 is also a bad one. And you know why this is also a bad one? It's because, and I actually
00:02:24 remember like the very first podcast, like the procrastinators podcast discussion of
00:02:30 like what it should be. We were discussing this at the very, very, very beginning.
00:02:35 Oh, that's history. It is a history fucking cool. Because Ben was like pushing for the
00:02:42 podcast to have a topic like a theme, like a thing that we would do. And every week we
00:02:47 would do a thing. And Nate was like, no, it's okay, we can just turn our like conversations
00:02:53 that we have all the time in the chat into a topic, we just talk about any topic. And
00:02:57 that eventually won. And so the procrastinators podcast became topics of any type that we
00:03:04 were talking about. And that has been like the curse. If only if only we'd listen to Ben, if
00:03:10 only we'd listen to Ben and made the show something that you could, you could, you know, it
00:03:15 could stay fresh by having like a structure to it. Right, right. And a structure that was
00:03:21 flexible and not just completely dictated by weird ass segments that we tap on the very end. So
00:03:26 here's what the structure of the PCP is right now. You got the intro, you got the Urban Dictionary
00:03:31 reading every single time. You got that every single time. Then you got the top the actual
00:03:36 topic for an hour. And then at the end, just shit that I assume everyone turns out like tunes
00:03:41 out for because I tune out for it because because what is it? It's just being like, Oh, wow, look
00:03:45 at this fan art. It's really good. Thank you. Look at these things. They're like, I like the fan
00:03:50 interaction. I like building the community. That's always good. I mean, dude, some of the
00:03:55 fan art has been fucking sick. Like the main stuff has been dope as fuck. It has been like
00:03:59 as as as as an audio pod. Yeah, as a segment in a podcast, it's sort of like, I don't know, feels
00:04:07 I mean, it is obligatory. Like I would react nicely to it normally, but like to have to voice
00:04:13 it in a podcast makes it sort of weird to me anyway.
00:04:18 To have to come up with something just like like for the sake of coming up for something on for
00:04:24 the segment, then it just means Oh, autumn, like automatically, it means that we're forcing
00:04:29 ourselves to say something like like for a lot of like fan art, I'd like it a whole bunch. I'm
00:04:34 glad that it exists. But it's not like we need to have an entire hour long segment dedicated. This
00:04:39 is why are we doing this right now? Okay, we podcast. Do we have anything to say about podcasts?
00:04:48 Well, I mean, I guess the interesting thing about podcasts is like podcasts started way back in
00:04:52 like 2003, like the early 2000s, they started doing podcasts just because it was an efficient way
00:04:57 with like internet speeds and stuff of the time to do long form content. This was like pre
00:05:02 YouTube pre like being able to do long format video. So like podcasts were just an efficient way
00:05:07 of like going through iTunes and going through RSS and stuff of getting like radio style content on
00:05:14 demand through the internet, you know, it was definitely it was a medium that was defined by
00:05:18 like technical limitations at the time, you know, like iPods back then, because that's what the
00:05:22 name podcast came from was putting them on your iPod is like a broadcast on your iPod, whatever,
00:05:27 was because they only did audio, you couldn't watch a video on an iPod, you didn't have internet
00:05:31 connection at the time on your iPod, it was like, it was a different time back in 2002, people. But
00:05:37 um, obviously, as technology evolved and shit, like podcasts kind of became sort of antiquated,
00:05:42 you know, now we just like we throw a video up on YouTube that you can or cannot watch, you know,
00:05:46 depending on how artistic you are. And it still functions as the same thing, because that's just
00:05:50 what the format is. But like, the the the limitation no longer has to be there, people do our long
00:05:56 video podcasts, you can stream and watch or whatever. But the interesting thing is like, we're
00:06:01 kind of sweet, like there's a bunch of people I watch, like there's a podcast, Gary Vee's podcast,
00:06:06 which I watch a lot, and listen to, I suppose. And he's talking about and I think it makes a lot
00:06:11 of sense that like audio is making a big comeback now, because like, there's so much shit online
00:06:16 right now, and there's and people are just like super busy, that like podcasts now, even though
00:06:20 they're not, it's not a technical constraint anymore, people value time and the ability to
00:06:24 multitask. And like, we talk about this all the time, like we put on a podcast in the background
00:06:29 while we're doing something else, you know, that's something you can't do with a video. So
00:06:32 what started as like a technical limits limitation is now like a convenience thing, because like
00:06:37 we're so bombarded with media, and like, I want to play this video game while doing this while
00:06:40 doing that. Well, now podcasts allow you to do I felt like that for a while. But I feel like
00:06:45 that's like a trap mindset, like if you're you're trapped at work, like, and you're doing a nine
00:06:51 to five, you know, when you have to leave, then it's probably okay. But like, if you're a person
00:06:57 who can like, like, so I feel like this, this is a sort of thing, like if you put on a video of
00:07:05 any length, you feel like you want to watch it to the end. And you're like, okay, I'm, I need a
00:07:11 break. I need a lunch break. So I'm going to go get some lunch. And I'm going to watch a video. And
00:07:15 it's like 20 minutes long, you finish eating after like six minutes. And and then you're watching a
00:07:21 video for like 14 minutes longer than you wouldn't you wanted to have a break for. And I feel like
00:07:26 podcasts for me, for a long time was just like, Well, I'm watching it. I haven't got to the end of
00:07:33 it yet. I got to finish it before I can do anything else to do with audio. And that's that
00:07:38 it's terrible. It's the worst thing that I've ever I've cut out most podcasts out of my life,
00:07:44 because of this reason. It's like a time it's like a multitasking thing, but only for people who do
00:07:52 the most menial of tasks. I resonate with that a lot. But I feel like I have more space in my
00:07:59 heart for podcasts for stuff like videos where it's like, I mean, the most common example is did
00:08:03 you or did you would always talk about how monkeys podcast was perfect or podcast? Nuzlocke was
00:08:09 perfect for lunches because he could eat a sandwich in the meantime while he watched it. And I was
00:08:14 like, Yeah, that makes sense. But actually doing it for like any video above like 20 minutes, I've
00:08:20 actually been doing this a lot funnily enough with digi videos, where I've turned on one of the
00:08:24 Bloodborne Let's Places doing with May, and then I'll either Chipotle, and I'll either do it really
00:08:29 slowly so I can trick myself into thinking that I'm maximizing my time by like finishing the
00:08:34 burrito like a couple minutes before it ends, or just eat like normal. And then and then just be
00:08:39 like, Well, I've already started this video. It has 16 more minutes, but but you know, I've already
00:08:43 started. So I just want to continue. But like podcasts, I think are great, because I don't
00:08:48 really video edit a lot. Certainly have anything to work with with audio a lot of the time. So I
00:08:52 can just draw and put it on a podcast and it is of little effect to me. Yeah, it's good for
00:08:59 some people who don't have to to work with audio. So there's things or something to say about how
00:09:04 my brain has been permanently altered and I am a new type. And my brain does not function the same
00:09:11 way that I think you guys might, where it just due to the fact that I've always grown up on the
00:09:15 internet and there's always been a thousand things to do at once. I feel like I'm like
00:09:20 constantly if I'm not doing two things at once, my life is being wasted. And I know that that's a
00:09:25 complete like that's not true at all. And in fact, you should just be focused on one thing at all.
00:09:31 But it's just it's just like a social thing that's been hammered into me and my brain can no longer
00:09:35 work. And like right now, I'm just rocking back and forth, looking at my audacity. And I'm also
00:09:39 like strolling through Twitter right out at the same time, because I'm fucking broken. And I'm
00:09:44 I'm a media creation. That is not a new type thing. That is something everybody I think deals
00:09:50 with at some point. If they if they get used to being able to do two things at once kind of
00:09:56 like, like, I know a lot of us who are like in the PCP have just talked about like being unable
00:10:04 to play a game without listening to a podcast. Like if there's not a new podcast, I'm not playing
00:10:08 any more Dark Souls, I need something to listen to. I've heard Digi say that I've kind of felt
00:10:13 like that sometimes. But I don't like it because I don't know, it's just it's it feels like it's
00:10:20 fake. It's like cheating. It's like not real podcasts, and let's plays and like video content
00:10:26 where you're listening to other people. If they're not like incredibly interesting, it's usually just
00:10:31 like a surrogate friendship chat, like, like, you know, I'm just hanging out with my friends,
00:10:37 they're speaking, they're making funny noises, and I'm going hey, and I'm playing video games.
00:10:41 I'm just like in the room with them playing video games. And I'm like, it's it's like a
00:10:48 it's not a fix for actual human interaction and like relationship building. It's sort of like a
00:10:56 what do you call it, like a quick get rich quick on friendship high. Yeah, like a high. And it's
00:11:05 I feel like the ideal is to never listen to anything like that. If you can avoid it, but
00:11:13 people sort of sink into that sort of lifestyle and they can't help like listen to and watch millions
00:11:19 of hours of people talking about stuff. And I don't think it's healthy. I don't think it's a good
00:11:24 thing you can you should do because if you do it too much, you think that's all you need because
00:11:29 it's the highest the fix if it sort of prevents you from realizing that you have a lack of like,
00:11:36 you know, if you do actually have a lack of like human interaction in your life,
00:11:40 you sort of dull that sense by by listening to all this stuff. And then occasionally you'll
00:11:45 remember oh yeah, I'm really lonely and you'll explode. There's just so many problems inherent
00:11:55 to the idea of a personality driven show. From the point of the producer to the voice actor
00:12:03 to the consumer, there is just it's just a riddle of like a medium riddled with problems
00:12:09 where okay, I listen to a lot of podcasts admittedly, but they're only podcasts that I feel like
00:12:15 have a point and enrich my life in a number of ways. I named drop to the beginning,
00:12:19 Revolutions, which is a history podcast, which has no personality really, the guy will occasionally
00:12:26 crack a joke, but it's mainly just hit him, you know, reciting history lessons, which I enjoy
00:12:31 greatly. And then there's Hello Internet, which is a show admittedly built upon personalities.
00:12:37 But the reason I care about the personalities is because they constantly have interesting
00:12:41 conversation that is that are integral to my enjoyment of them as people. I would not really
00:12:47 care about CGP Grey or Brady if they were just two, you know, comedy hosts, so they're just there
00:12:53 for chuckles and laughs. But the fact that they have genuine enriching conversations about technology
00:12:58 and science and stuff is the reason why I tune into that. And just like having personalities
00:13:03 parade around in podcasts or let's plays or whatever will like, okay, on the part of the
00:13:10 creator, it will get old fast for them to do, they will not have a direction, so they'll mostly
00:13:15 have to flounder. And it's not sustainable anyway, because you only have so many like stories and
00:13:21 relatable points to mine from the cold pit that is your soul to parade around to the point where
00:13:27 after you've done like a year or two of that content, you'll be all tapped out on, well,
00:13:33 I've already told this story, I've already showed this part of my personality, I've already done
00:13:36 this gimmick for them. So you just have to flip out, you know, retarded shit that you don't actually
00:13:40 care about, but you just want to phone in, you know, sort of like a podcast topic, something like
00:13:44 that, you know, some sort of like meta commentary such as that. And then on the point of the consumer,
00:13:48 again, like what you said, a hippo, it's just, you know, arbitrarily filling in the space of a real
00:13:55 friend. I don't know how many times I've, you know, like, like, my let's plays to hanging out with
00:14:01 real friends ratio is horribly skewed. And I never, I've never gotten the same amount of amusement
00:14:08 or joy I've gotten out of listening to let's play, as opposed to just inviting my friends over and
00:14:13 playing smash. Those memories that I have with my actual real friends are greater than any enjoyment
00:14:19 I've ever gotten out of let's play in my entire fucking life. So why do I do it? Because it's easy,
00:14:24 because I because, you know, because sometimes I don't want to deal with having people or sometimes
00:14:28 I don't want to clean up my room. I just want to sit around in the darkness. I want to watch a let's
00:14:31 play. It's disgusting. It's horrible. It gives me nothing. The personalities on display in most
00:14:38 let's plays are not inherently interesting. Game for us was good because they occasionally had
00:14:42 really in depth conversation and it might not be, you know, like the most high of mind conversation,
00:14:46 but with conversation that you cared about the Nickelodeon gut stuff is not just funny because
00:14:50 it's John and Aaron making goofy noises. It's funny because it's relatable and you've had those
00:14:54 experiences before in your life. And it's interesting to hear, you know, people get mad at one another.
00:14:58 It's interesting because of the thing that the personalities are talking about not just because
00:15:01 the personalities are speaking inherently, which is what we're doing right now. Where's where's
00:15:06 washed up personalities who were funny and who were cool and people liked listening to because
00:15:11 they watch old PCP topics and they're like, oh man, I love this funny fucking one. They keep
00:15:17 referencing the Wake Me Up song by whatever that band is or like this one where they talk about all
00:15:22 the memes that need design and almost all of them are not memes. That's what the really fucked up
00:15:27 weird editing style. I like all of those things because they were interesting topics. Those were
00:15:32 interesting things that people wanted to hear about. Those were things that people were like,
00:15:35 oh yeah, I like these personalities because they're talking about this topic and this topic is integral
00:15:40 to their work, their social life and something they've talked about before. So they have a lot
00:15:44 of interesting things to say. But nowadays, it's just like, oh, what do we do? What do we do? We're
00:15:48 gonna pull up document. Oh, wow. Look at all these topics. They're all one noun and this one noun
00:15:54 we have to talk about for an entire hour and one hour specifically. Even if you're, you know,
00:15:59 you've somehow gotten lucky one and you want to go over one hour or if you it's something that
00:16:04 you've actually want to talk about, but no one else has approached the topic from the same angle
00:16:08 as you. So you've just been waiting itching to say your actual point between the entire thing.
00:16:11 Oh, oh, no, one hour. Alright, everyone stop. You know, it's one hour. You know, we gotta turn
00:16:16 the thing in. It's baked. It's good. It's done. Just push it out. It's over. It's a podcast topic.
00:16:21 Yeah, it's really fucking funny. What do they say about podcasts? I've said all that. Yep. What else?
00:16:27 What else? You've said all the things. Do you remember the fucking horse cuss? Do you remember
00:16:33 the good old days when the pony boys would jump into a call and talk about nothing?
00:16:39 That was fun. It's so the horse cuss. I've actually re-listened to all of the
00:16:43 horse cuss recently for my own nefarious purposes. Type in YouTube ham n o i z. Type in
00:16:52 that to YouTube and you'll find a secret item hidden behind the wall. But anyway,
00:16:58 I've re-listened to all of the podcast, the horse cuss recently, and it's kind of jarring
00:17:03 not only to see how everyone's personality has changed, but also to hear them make like
00:17:07 allusions to like friendship and like, you know, playing video games or like watching anime or like,
00:17:17 you know, speaking. Yeah, it's it's so much more clinical now back then. It was like,
00:17:25 we'd I we don't we didn't have conversations in person. Those were like the first times we
00:17:32 were talking audibly to each other. And that it was just you could it's so weird. It's so weird.
00:17:40 I don't like how where we are right now. It's just it's a product of our own design. It's
00:17:47 it's of our own design that this is the case. Because there's no reason why we have to have
00:17:53 one noun topics. It's not even like we had one noun topics throughout the entirety of this show.
00:17:59 There were there were some things that were just like, like, like broad topics that we just,
00:18:02 you know, switch in and out of back in the early days. People liked that we went off topic and we
00:18:08 branched out from one topic to another. Because you know, that's how conversations work. That's
00:18:14 how real life interaction works is you talk about one thing. And then you talk about for as long or
00:18:19 as little as you want, because there's no reason to pad out time or to reduce the amount of time to
00:18:24 make a concise YouTube video. You just talk about for as long as you want to. And you know what?
00:18:30 Tugging for things as long as you want to usually interesting, because usually you know when things
00:18:36 aren't interesting. And you don't want to talk about bullshit for longer than you need to because
00:18:40 you're not you don't have you don't have time for that. Because you're not because you're pretty busy
00:18:44 and just want to say what you want to. And what you want to say is usually cool, because you're
00:18:48 saying it and you're a cool person. There's no reason to talk about things for an hour specifically.
00:18:54 That just that just was the case for all topics as we're talking from, you know, like around an hour
00:18:59 and hour and a half. We'll just make that the normal. We'll just make that we'll just make that
00:19:03 every single episode because that makes sense. Because because guarantee you guarantee you we
00:19:09 can talk about podcasts for an hour. Something we jumped into this medium. I've never even
00:19:16 the progress podcast was like the first podcast I ever really listened to.
00:19:20 I guess the horse cast technically. But you guys were the only podcast I had listened to.
00:19:24 And up until like a year ago, maybe even like nine months ago, I brightened out the other stuff,
00:19:30 revolution to low internet, other shit like that. You guys were the first. So like, like,
00:19:35 I don't it's not even to have a history podcast. And like, oh, well, my childhood, I used to watch
00:19:39 over the bum fuck podcast all the time. No, you guys, you guys were the podcast.
00:19:44 If we're doing an episode about podcasts, let's talk about you guys, because you guys are the
00:19:48 only podcasts that I listened to. And what has happened? Why? Why is it like this? I was a fan.
00:19:54 I was a fan of the PCP. And I loved it with all my heart. I was in the fan chat. I prowled out
00:20:00 every single day. And now I'm here. And why have you bespurched me in this way? I wanted to be
00:20:06 like the horse. That's why I'm fucking here. He was like, Oh, I love these guys. Oh, I love
00:20:10 the gym. They're so interesting. I've never seen I've never heard these opinions before in my life.
00:20:15 Here's why it's because due to various, you know, happenings of life, we talked about so much stuff
00:20:25 in the discord or the Skype rather. We talked for so long about so many things. And we started
00:20:32 to have podcast things where we would elaborate on what we were saying in the chat. And we did
00:20:38 that so much that we stopped having things to say to each other that weren't like fresh news,
00:20:43 like new things that were going on. We knew each other so well through what we had said,
00:20:49 that there was nothing new to talk about. And now every week, we have to shuffle on into this
00:20:54 little this this this gross little gray room. And the topic list and be like, do you have
00:21:02 anything to say about that? I've never heard any of you talk about this topic, but maybe everyone
00:21:08 will have something to say. Yeah. No, no. I think it's because like now that it's it's like expected
00:21:15 to come out every week that there's like money involved. And it's like, Oh, we got to make a
00:21:18 podcast. We got to have a product to make as opposed to like, I mean, I was never on the
00:21:22 horsecast, but like the horsecast was more spontaneous. There was no schedule for the
00:21:27 horsecast. It just kind of happened. You know, all right, let me let me blow your fucking brains,
00:21:33 friends. PCP obviously comes out once week, because you know, not to make it sound too cynical,
00:21:42 like we're like, we're trying to pull a fast one on you or like we don't give a shit about
00:21:44 anything. But that's what's good for business. So that's what makes sense and is concise and
00:21:49 good for algorithm comes out once a week. And people just like regular people just like having
00:21:54 things come out on a regular time because it brings you know, familiarity to their life.
00:21:57 And just as an overall, you know, good thing to do if you want the podcast to grow, which
00:22:01 you wouldn't want the podcast to go. You want to build your business. And also you want to meet
00:22:04 more people with the content that you create. But here's the thing. It doesn't have to be that way.
00:22:10 That's not the way that things have to be. And you may think, Oh, but but of course,
00:22:16 having a regular schedule will of course make the podcast successful. Well, here's the thing.
00:22:22 The Hello Internet podcast is notorious for never coming out on time. And it has like
00:22:29 unbelievably diverse like windows of release. Sometimes it'll come out two in a single week.
00:22:35 Sometimes we'll be like an entire month before one release. And you may think,
00:22:39 ah, well, just because the fact that they have interesting conversation and they wait
00:22:43 to have recordings podcast and they have something to say and they make everything,
00:22:47 you know, actually interesting and they wait until they have points to discuss.
00:22:51 Just because they do that doesn't mean it'll be successful because, you know,
00:22:55 they aren't doing it right. They aren't releasing every week. They're making $4,000 per episode.
00:23:01 $4,000 $4,000 and $62. Sorry. Hello Internet is is a masterful show because it is clearly
00:23:11 it does the same thing that we used to do, which is we were talking about something in the chat
00:23:16 and be like, let's do a podcast about this. Let's hash it out in more in depth and record it.
00:23:22 And that was the initial idea. And they do that. But they do it, you know, whenever they actually
00:23:29 have anything to say. And it's it works so well, because those those guys have such chemistry
00:23:36 through like their interactions. It's just two guys. It's the fucking it's the best.
00:23:43 It's so great. And the thing to actually like talk about the podcast topic a little bit here,
00:23:48 just just a tiny little bit to satiate. Yeah. The reason I like Hello Internet,
00:23:54 which is interesting to me is that there's no cursing on Hello Internet.
00:23:58 There's no apparent jokes. There's no real wet comedy. It's just like two people
00:24:07 who are nice, upstanding, like normal citizens, just speaking to one another about their experiences
00:24:15 who they are content creators. They speak about some of the same stuff that we talked about a
00:24:20 long time ago, but they just do it without cursing or making themselves weird targets of drama
00:24:26 or like weird social pariahs. They don't curse. They don't do weird shit. They just talk like
00:24:34 normal. And they have interesting points about like technology and the state of humanity,
00:24:40 space travel. These are just upstanding citizens. And they're living the high life. They go on
00:24:47 trips all the time. And they turn their and you know, they have interesting things to say about
00:24:52 the trips. It's all perfect. CGP Cray is literally my ideal life, but I literally, I literally cannot
00:25:00 live the CGP gray life anymore. I cannot. I didn't think of this a lot recently. I cannot run for
00:25:05 president. I don't want to run for president, but I could not. I cannot have any political office
00:25:12 because I've done this show and I've said the n-word a lot. I cannot do that anymore. My life
00:25:19 is so limited by my own design. This is what I wanted. This is what I wanted my life to be. And
00:25:25 now that it's, now that it's here, I realize, oh, I don't have to scream. Oh, I don't have to make
00:25:31 jokes. Oh, I don't have to curse. I don't have to be edgy. I don't have to do any of those things.
00:25:36 But this is what I wanted. And this is the life that I have now. It's like growing up, dude,
00:25:42 like you fucking realize that like, oh, I don't have to like put on airs and shit. I can just be
00:25:47 who I want to be. My life would be better for it. The thing that like I've noticed about, I guess,
00:25:54 our dynamic and shit is like, the topics are very forced because like we have this list, we have to
00:26:00 do one topic. I always felt that the PCP is in this interesting like middle ground of like the two
00:26:05 extremes that I think are six or make for a more successful podcast. Like the podcast that I like
00:26:11 the most are either podcasts that are a single topic. And it's exploring that topic in depth in
00:26:18 each episode. So like, I listened to like a podcast called pro blogger. And like most of the podcasts
00:26:24 I listened to are just like to get information. But like pro blogger is about blogging. Every
00:26:29 episode is about blogging. And it just explores a different aspect of that. So like, there's always
00:26:34 a singular kind of like cohesive concept behind the entire show. So you go in knowing exactly
00:26:39 what you're going to get. And the people who do the show have a direction every episode, they always
00:26:45 know like, Okay, there's one big meta topic that that drives this entire production. So there's
00:26:50 all there's never any like doubt or confusion as to what are we going to talk about this week,
00:26:54 it's like, blogging, obviously, but how, right? And then the other end of the spectrum is like
00:26:58 when it's personality driven, it's just like whatever the people are passionate about and like
00:27:03 not trying to like, have it be focused on one, like topic for that episode, we're in the middle
00:27:10 where we have one topic, but it's there's no cohesion behind it. Like we don't just dissect
00:27:16 like a big meta topic. It's just like, it's like the worst of both sides kind of like, and that's
00:27:22 what we're doing on once on the other side is like something like the Dick show where it initially
00:27:29 was like, he had like a gimmick where he was trying to find a cohost. But then it turns,
00:27:34 it's like morphed into just occasionally talking about Maddox drama and then Dick being mad about
00:27:42 stuff that happened throughout the week. And there's always something to be mad about. So he has
00:27:47 like an endless well that he can pull from to make big rants. And then he has people on it's just
00:27:53 like, it's a show about him and it's a show about how mad he gets at the world. And that's all it
00:27:58 needs to be. There's never a topic on anything. And then yeah, on the other side, there's
00:28:04 the stuff like the fucking, the fucking podcast, chibi barkers, the Ghibli cast, the pony cast,
00:28:12 arm retrieval, all those are way better than the procrastinators podcast because they have points.
00:28:17 They have a reason to exist. Because they're talking about things. Exactly.
00:28:23 Because every episode you're like, Oh, what are they good? What's the weird topic? They are real
00:28:27 at this time. Oh, they're just going to continue with the talking about because they have more
00:28:31 stuff to say on it. They're just going through a show. They're going through a webcomic. They
00:28:34 want to talk. Oh, oh, it has a point. Oh, it has a reason to exist. The PCP is ostensibly a show
00:28:42 about us, right? It's about the hosts. Like no one comes here. No, not a single soul has clicked
00:28:50 on this episode thinking, Oh, wow, I really like podcasts. I can't wait to see these people talking
00:28:57 about podcasts. Oh, I'm really excited for this kind of guys. No, they all come here because they're
00:29:02 like, I remember Ben saying, I remember Jesus. You nearly said Jesse. I nearly said Jesse. Oh,
00:29:15 no. And then I was like, Oh, I swear, I can't say that. And then I did. But anyway, the point is,
00:29:22 is that we, like, we like, to make the show make sense, it would be Hello Internet. It would be
00:29:32 the life and times of an internet creator and the stuff we go through working day and
00:29:37 out, you know, the steps we've taken in our careers and in our personal lives. Okay, what's
00:29:41 like to be an internet person? Here's the problem taking this weird awful topic system and make
00:29:46 no sense. Here's the thing. And this is the second thing I was going to bring up like,
00:29:50 because we're talking about like, Oh, like the old PCP in the horse cast would be continuations
00:29:54 of what we talk about in the chat. Like, I don't read the chat anymore, because every time I look
00:29:59 at the chat, it's always cynical, negative bullshit. And I don't feel like reading it. Like,
00:30:04 every time someone posts something, it's complaining about a YouTuber or complaining
00:30:09 about something or shitting on something. And I don't want to hear about that. I don't care.
00:30:15 I completely agree with you, Tom. Every time that I tune in here, it's just like a wall of tech.
00:30:21 It's just like message upon message of like, Oh, the YouTube industry fucking sucks. Oh,
00:30:27 everyone's just here to make a buckle. It makes no sense. Oh, it's all just a bunch of shit.
00:30:31 And I don't want to hear about that, because I love the internet. Right. I like making internet
00:30:37 content. I like being here. Sure. There's reasons to get grumpy. In the horse cast, everyone
00:30:42 talked about like, Oh, all the way doing the chases make fun of YouTubers. But that was kind of fun,
00:30:46 because they were all making content themselves. And they all referenced the contents they made
00:30:50 themselves. And it was just a fun, a fun time. And that's part of life in times of the content
00:30:55 creators talking about the other creators in your space or made sense. But now it's just
00:31:00 nonstop cynicalness. It's just nonstop. Oh, everyone sucks but us, even though what are we doing?
00:31:07 What is this right now? Oh, is this really a paragon of what YouTube should be? Is this
00:31:13 what's happening right now? I'm going to kick off the podcast. I'm literally going to get picked
00:31:16 to kick off the podcast. This episode is going to air and I'm literally going to be kicked off.
00:31:22 Do you, do you not, do you not like me, Munchie? No, no. What are you saying?
00:31:30 I'm saying this, but I don't know if you know, I don't know if you've realized
00:31:35 you've been caught in a catch, a catch. This is not the podcast, this episode.
00:31:42 This is the disillusionment with the PCP episode. Oh my God, yes. Thank God. I'm so glad I didn't
00:31:48 miss it. Yeah. Right now we're talking about how the topic system makes no sense and how
00:31:57 we're ostensibly a personality driven show, but we pick topics that do not accentuate our
00:32:02 personalities whatsoever. And there's no sense for us to cynically pick topics that none of us
00:32:07 have an interest in like podcasts. Well, what do, what do personality driven shows talk about?
00:32:14 Stuff like, stuff like Hello Internet, where they're talking about the stuff that's happened,
00:32:17 you know, in their lives, anecdotes, stuff that's been on their mind, stuff that might not cleanly
00:32:22 fit into a one hour window, stuff that just might, you know, be casual conversations that the others
00:32:26 can build upon. You know what? I mean, do we even have that much happening in our real lives?
00:32:34 Yeah. And yeah, yeah, Ben, and you know where we, you know where me, you talk about that,
00:32:38 is Ryfurg's cop killers? The YouTube videos are constant non, like, like wall to wall
00:32:45 shit that has happened in our lives. And it's all fucking interesting because we pick our
00:32:49 topics carefully and they all don't have to fit into a sensible time period. It is, it is peak
00:32:54 content. You know what? I mean, sometimes, sometimes the topic system yields good results.
00:33:04 Sometimes, but not right now.
00:33:09 Okay, I fucked up and slept through the PCP today. So I mean, you guys have been, you know,
00:33:18 I'm here to save the show because you guys have been floundering with only three guys,
00:33:22 but I'm here, I'm here, I'm a breath of fresh air. I'm here, I'm here with my rude to and my,
00:33:28 and my, you know, and my, my, my radical leftism. Just, just to spice things up a little bit. Did
00:33:36 you guys hear about that? That there, there's, there's 10, 10 genders now and they're all male.
00:33:43 Yeah, yeah, that's a meme. Hey, whoa, ha ha, patreon.com.
00:33:50 I'm sorry, I'll see myself out. It's been a pleasure, everyone.
00:33:54 Let's just do a horse cast. Let's just stop doing this. Let's just do a horse cast where we just
00:34:00 talk about things that we care about. And that's happened before in our lives in the past week.
00:34:06 Yeah, because there's a lot of things that happened to me that I don't talk about on
00:34:12 podcasts, but I talk about on my patreon people thing. I mean, there's, there's, there's adventures
00:34:19 that have, that are being had. Ben, you've moved, you've moved, you're in a completely different
00:34:24 city now. Oh God, I bet, look, that's all bound up in some shit that I don't want to talk about ever.
00:34:34 Well, fine. I, well, I mean, about the moving, I mean, I mean,
00:34:40 my house, I mean, I'm in a sick house. It's pretty great. Where are you? I'm real happy to be back
00:34:45 in Boston. Are you back, are you back in the monkey house? Yeah, oh yeah, I am in monkey
00:34:50 house, although we don't, okay. Actually, this is interesting and frustrating to me. I come back
00:34:56 to monkey house only for them to tell me that they don't call it monkey house anymore. And I'm
00:35:02 like, yeah. And I'm like, okay, so just last night, I finally, I finally popped the question. I finally
00:35:09 was like, all right guys, when did it, when did it stop being monkey? Apparently now for a while,
00:35:16 it was Beijing house. And now it's, now it's wheelhouse, which dude, I don't know. I'll never,
00:35:24 I'll never, why was it called monkey house in the first place? Well, it was because
00:35:30 when we, when my friend found a shit, I shouldn't use people's real names, when he found the house
00:35:36 and like, got a bunch of people that wanted to move into it. We made a Facebook chat group to
00:35:43 like, you know, discuss the move. And someone sent someone set the the automatic like button,
00:35:51 someone changed the like button so that it was a monkey face. And so we became monkey.
00:35:57 And then like, and then dad, who is a print maker, he brought over this, he brought over this like
00:36:04 this little print of six different monkeys. And he like, and he took out like a fucking power drill
00:36:11 and use these giant bolts and like bolted this tiny thing into the wall. And they and there were
00:36:18 six of us. So we were six monkeys, hands monkey hat. But anyway, a lot of shit went down while I
00:36:24 was gone. Like there were a lot of like, kind of weird and or somewhat scary people lived here.
00:36:31 Because while I was gone, there was an empty, scary. I mean, at least one of them was a drug dealer.
00:36:41 I can't remember if someone, okay, the place got trash, one of our former roommates,
00:36:46 and possibly his girlfriend, who, weirdly enough, I matched with that girl on Tinder
00:36:52 the other day. And it was a very awkward exchange because because she recognized me. Well, she
00:36:58 she asked me, do we know each other? And I was like, do we. And then I realized because she
00:37:02 has a butterfly tattoo on her leg. And I remembered it. And I was like, you, you trashed our house.
00:37:09 Yeah. So that was weird. And she said, I mean, should I talk about what she said? Because it was
00:37:15 Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Did she deny this statement? She not at first. Like, she was like,
00:37:25 okay, you like who I was like, Oh, yeah, you trashed her house. And she was like,
00:37:31 what? And I was like, monkey house. And she was like, Oh, great. And I was like, yeah.
00:37:38 She didn't disconnect. She was like, Oh, great. Like here it comes. Yeah. Yeah. She didn't. She
00:37:41 did not disconnect at that point. I don't know what happened next. You know, I could probably
00:37:46 just get it up on my phone. But shit, my battery is dead. The point is, so we were talking about
00:37:51 this guy, this ex got roommate that used to live with us. He had come back and trashed her house.
00:37:56 Apparently he had put dish soap in the dog bowl. Yeah, like, yeah. So like poison ostensibly to
00:38:04 poison a dog. And so I mentioned that to Oh my God, we should fucking should we cut her name out?
00:38:10 You mentioned three names so far. Well, this is whatever first names don't matter.
00:38:15 So, so, so I mentioned that to and she's like, Oh, a vegan putting dish soap in the dog. Well,
00:38:24 yeah, right. I'm like, okay, whatever. So she doesn't she doesn't come out and say it. Eventually,
00:38:29 I asked her like, are you saying that you didn't do it and that or that he made you do it or something?
00:38:35 And she is like, No, I didn't do it. And then she starts like, she's like, I hope,
00:38:42 I hope you never I hope you never date someone who who like tries to choke you while you're
00:38:46 driving them to work. And I'm like, Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. And then she's like, Listen,
00:38:52 he was he was the love of my life. And I'll never get over this. And I was like, God,
00:38:57 leave me alone. Listen, I was just I was just here.
00:39:03 Looking to make some friends and you and you sir have soured the mood. Yeah,
00:39:07 I was just looking to invite people to my fucking bounce house moon party on Saturday. And you're
00:39:14 and you're really bringing me down. Eventually, she was like, you, you people are all still haunting
00:39:20 me from this situation. I'll never get over this. Leave me alone. And I was like, I was like, fine.
00:39:26 I was like, Okay, you're like a ghost of Christmas past. But I was like, haunting her.
00:39:31 Guli over her head. I mean, I felt bad because she was clearly upset about all this. But also,
00:39:37 I don't care. Even a little bit. And that's my story. Well, she destroyed your house.
00:39:42 Maybe. I mean, she might she said she didn't. But it's like, she didn't seem to like push that
00:39:49 angle, which seems like the angle to push. If you got it. I don't know. Anyway, about monkey house.
00:39:57 It turns out that like, you know, all this shit had happened, the house getting trashed, people
00:40:02 coming in and out and like, you know, people, people changing the cast of characters here
00:40:07 changing. And finally, I guess it was around like last September, when weirdly enough, it was when
00:40:15 one of the original guys who had been there for monkey house moved back in. And yet for some
00:40:21 reason, this like around this time, everyone decided, you know what, this is the end of monkey
00:40:25 house, monkey house is over. So they had a party that was the end of monkey house,
00:40:32 like the end of Ava and forever after it was the end of monkey house, even though like four out of
00:40:38 the six original cast is still here. Weird. So I don't know. So what was the whole saga happened
00:40:45 while you were gone? Like nothing, like, like nothing, nothing was the end. Like at some point
00:40:51 after a bunch of stuff happened and or change, they were like, I think it's time, I think we
00:40:56 should stop calling it monkey house. And then they just did. And then I come back, it's like,
00:40:59 hey, I'm going to be back in monkey house. I'm four out of four out of six original cast.
00:41:06 Don't you know, don't you know about the wars? Yeah, we're not, we're not,
00:41:11 we're not real anymore. Now we're now we're wheelhouse, because it's a pun, get it? Because like,
00:41:16 oh, that's totally in my wheelhouse. And I'm like, what a fucking disappointment.
00:41:24 It doesn't good to be, does it feel good to be back in the area at least? Yes. Yes, it's
00:41:28 fucking great. And I missed it. I know, dude. I know, bro. I missed it so much. Dude, going to
00:41:35 Boston has been an absolute delight every single time I've gone. It's been so, so great. It is
00:41:41 a delight. And yet, let me, let me tell you, on the drive back to Boston, we passed through New York.
00:41:49 And it was a little bit, it was a little bit like, what's a good analogy? Like you finally,
00:41:56 like you want something and you finally get it. But at the same time, you see something else,
00:42:01 you know, like we drove through Manhattan and we stopped in Manhattan and we hung out there for
00:42:06 a while at this, at this manga store. And I can only assume the econ was with you. Yes. Okay,
00:42:13 okay. All right. All right. He insisted on, on this manga store and he spent like hundreds of
00:42:19 dollars on manga, which was funny. But he, so we, so we stopped at this manga store. And anyway,
00:42:25 the point is that New York was fucking great. And I have thought like, man, Boston's the best. But
00:42:29 then right before we get there, I'm like, wait a minute, New York's pretty good, though. Shit.
00:42:33 Um, New York's really expensive, though. I mean, Boston's really expensive too. But I don't live
00:42:40 downtown. I live, I live a great thing about Boston is you can live on the outskirts. You
00:42:46 could live on the outskirts and still be connected. Like I live in Medford, which is like pretty far
00:42:51 north. And yet I'm like a quick bus ride from like the inner Boston area. And then it's like a very
00:42:59 quick subway trip to the actual like center central downtown. Everything is like, like,
00:43:08 you can get every fucking which way in Boston, even the brief time that I've been there,
00:43:12 I've been at like easily like almost every sub that's like not on the blue line or like the
00:43:16 orange thing. I mean, every stop. Yeah. If you're, I mean, if you're on the, if you're on the tee,
00:43:21 like if you're near the tee, you can go anywhere. Yeah. Like, like, like nothing will stop you.
00:43:26 Especially since like in almost like every stop, you can just like change trains. It doesn't cost
00:43:32 you more money to get back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You get on and then you make as many fucking changes
00:43:37 as well. Usually only need to change trains once. But yeah, you can go entirely from like,
00:43:44 you can ride like two entire subway or lines, but they're full, full distance for like $2.50.
00:43:50 You guys sound adorable talking about the trains being like that. When when in London,
00:43:56 it's like, it's like that times 10 in every aspect. Oh, Pshh. Oh, Pshh. You would love,
00:44:04 you would fucking love to see King's Cross St. Pancras. It is fucking, it's like an airport,
00:44:09 how big it is. There's like 70 different fucking train stations in one train station.
00:44:15 There should definitely be a hippo, munchy power hour, pow wow someday. I definitely,
00:44:21 I very much intend to go to England one day, whether you're alive or not,
00:44:25 which, which, you know, fingers crossed in London. It's called the tube, right?
00:44:30 Yeah, the underground, the tube. Okay. Okay. All right. I see. No, I see it. I see it. It's
00:44:42 okay. I'm looking at a map of it right now. I wouldn't say that it puts the tea to shame
00:44:47 per se, but, you know,
00:44:51 the tea has made me aware of the greatest luxury in life, which is good public transportation.
00:44:57 It changes everything about your life irreplically going to Boston and I mean, like, oh, I can just
00:45:05 like go downtown and then hang out and just like get back home and it won't cost me like $20 to go
00:45:12 there. Good public transportation is fucking amazing. The bus in San Diego fucking sucks.
00:45:19 The way like, like it only has like scenic routes, which means you're going to like,
00:45:24 spend like $5 to get downtown in like 40 minutes to an hour if you're lucky and there's no traffic.
00:45:31 It's fucking horrendous. Okay. So in, so in Atlanta, there is, there's like, all right,
00:45:39 I never really spent much time in Atlanta proper, but apparently there is like a road
00:45:45 that circles Atlanta and inside this perimeter, you are ITP and outside this perimeter, you are
00:45:53 outside the perimeter, you are OTP and like, there's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's a,
00:46:00 so there's like a, there's like a difference in kind in terms of like how easy it is to get around
00:46:05 to like whether anyone wants to hang out with you. Okay. Yeah, whether you're ITP or OTP. You're
00:46:11 on the outskirts of reality. And I was, I was OTP, which was, was not great. There was a bus,
00:46:18 there was a bus that would go into Atlanta, but it would only go in the mornings. You could only
00:46:24 catch it a couple times in the mornings. And it was really, it was long and bad.
00:46:30 Yeah. You sure were in the OTP, but you sure weren't in AOTP. Am I right? High five me. High
00:46:39 five, high five. I, that's, I'm extremely uncomfortable right now. We'll delete that,
00:46:45 we'll delete that. No, it's, no, you're right. High five, high five. All right, okay, all right,
00:46:51 okay, let's simmer down. So, um, so, I was going to ask Tom, because like, I just got to, I just
00:46:56 got to talk about the Atlanta subway because it's just a cross that runs up and down and left and
00:47:00 right. And it's not, it's not great. I mean, it's okay. It helps. And like Atlanta is not,
00:47:06 it's, it's less sprawling than Boston, I think. So like, I think for Atlanta, it works pretty
00:47:11 okay. You can get anywhere. There's just not as many places to get. Um, but the bus system is,
00:47:16 is kind of, kind of bad and, and confusing. And Boston has like Boston has very good buses. They
00:47:22 go all over the fucking place and they run all the fucking time. It's really good.
00:47:27 Yeah. All right. That's it. That's all I have to say about that.
00:47:29 Yeah. So, so speaking of like moving around, uh, Tom. Yeah. Yes. What, what's, what's the deal
00:47:35 with you? Are you still in, going to be living in a car? Is that still a thing that's gonna heal?
00:47:40 Uh, yes, yes, that is happening. Great. Probably within the next week or so. I think I'm gonna
00:47:46 like stay here for the fourth and then I've been, this has been like coming, like I've been hearing
00:47:52 about this eventuality for like a long time, like over a year. It's about damn time, Tom.
00:47:58 It's about, I kind of agree. No, the thing is, is that like I keep, there keeps, there's a lot of
00:48:03 like family conflicts going on and I'm not going to get too deep into it, but just know that it's
00:48:08 been threatened multiple times that the house will be sold by X date. And then I go into a panic
00:48:14 trying to get everything set up and ready to go. And then the date comes and nothing has happened
00:48:18 and, and, and, and was like, okay, well, I guess I just like lost a decade off my life for no reason
00:48:24 then. And then like a few months after that, a new date will be presented and, and I'll have to
00:48:30 like redo the whole thing over and over again, but this time it's really gonna be real. And,
00:48:36 Is it? Yeah. So I bought, I bought my car. I got my shit packed up and it's gonna be an adventure.
00:48:45 So I plan on first going where Digi is, we're just going to hang out for a bit and just shoot
00:48:49 the shit and like be bros for real. And that'll be interesting. I guess I'll be seeing you soon.
00:48:55 Yeah, dude, like I'm going to be around in the area. So we should all, you want to come for,
00:48:59 you want to come for the fireworks on the fourth? Maybe. I don't know if I'm, I know I'm like
00:49:04 grilling some of my dad on the fourth. I'm hanging out with Munchy. Can I say, can I say,
00:49:11 can I say someone's name? Okay. Kazi? Yes. Okay. I didn't know who he was saying.
00:49:18 Yeah. I'm not, I'm not in control of who speaks her name and who doesn't.
00:49:23 Oh wait, Nate, wait, Nate, Nate talks about Michelle on here. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. I got nervous
00:49:30 because I fucked up and said real names before. Yeah. Yeah. Kazi's coming and, and you know,
00:49:36 Kazi, which is, which is her real name, of course. That's, that's right. Shut up.
00:49:42 Wait, yeah, I know her real name. I don't even know your real name, Munchy.
00:49:47 Everyone knows my real name. I actually, I don't know what that's supposed to say about that later.
00:49:52 Yeah. Anyway, we're going to, I saw the fireworks on the Charles Bridge a couple years ago and it
00:49:56 was really great and we're going to do it again. It's going to be fun. And hopefully this time,
00:50:00 the smoke from the fireworks won't blow right over her faces and choke us and make us gag.
00:50:05 That sounds unpleasant, but I will try and make it. Yeah, that would be fun. I'm so,
00:50:09 I'm so fucking jealous. I would love to do that. Also, what I'm also envious of is Ben, you are going
00:50:16 to be able to play Pokemon Go for real this time. You're going to be able to go to fucking
00:50:22 Boston Common and play on Community Day. Do you understand the magnitude of people playing
00:50:28 in the area with real people? Yeah, that's going to be way sick. That's going to be way
00:50:32 fucking sick, dude. I was not prepared for the community of Boston because the community of
00:50:38 San Diego is there's like a few people, some of them raid, basically no one raids. And even when
00:50:45 you do raid, no one talks to another. They're all just huddled. They're all looking at their phones.
00:50:48 No one's looking up. No one's saying hello. But in Boston, people, okay, first of all,
00:50:53 you meet unbelievable caricatures. And then also everyone, even like the normal people,
00:50:58 are just talking to everyone. Everyone's super friendly. Everyone's having a good time. They're
00:51:02 just becoming big groups that go on raiding adventures for the entire day together. It's
00:51:06 great. I feel like I've missed out on quality PCP lore bonding by dropping off the Pokemon Go
00:51:14 bandwagon. I feel like I need to get back on that. I have to. The only times I have really
00:51:20 Pokemon Go is when, I mean, I did a little bit here and there, but for the most part, I only did
00:51:26 at Radcon and Armortreeblecon. It's pronounced Pokemon Went in that.
00:51:31 I went for a bit, but now I'm not going anymore. Tom, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Are you not in
00:51:36 the separate chat we made for Pokemon Go, the separate Discord server that we've been talking
00:51:40 in? Wait, I clearly know. Wait, send me the fucking link. No, not really, you fucking idiots.
00:51:47 Oh, god, shit. We should fucking make like a chat. I'm doing that right now. I'm literally in
00:51:55 the process of doing it right now. Because I have also been getting into Pokemon. It's really just
00:51:59 like the update that added trading and friends lists, and now it's like great that I can see
00:52:07 people playing the game in some sort of way and be like, yeah, I'm gonna download it right now.
00:52:12 I'm getting it. Dude, I'm about to post my frame code in chat right fucking now. There's nothing
00:52:16 you can do to stop me. All you fucking babies and I'm just like, oh, oh, munchies playing Pokemon
00:52:22 Go. Oh, I'll jump on the bandwagon when I'm the pioneer. Motherfucker. To ever click on Pokemon.
00:52:28 I was there. I fucking downloaded Pokemon Go illegally before it was out in the UK because
00:52:33 I wanted to play it so much. How did you do that? I googled it. There was a way to download it
00:52:40 onto like a USB and then download it into your phone from the computer and then activate it in
00:52:47 a secret way, but then it became the real game anyway. I don't know how it works, but I still
00:52:51 have that. Did your account transfer over? It did. So I was managing, I was like the only person,
00:52:58 well, not the only person, there's clearly a few other people who were playing, but like
00:53:02 for a few weeks, I was the only person I could see playing Pokemon Go and I was always looking out
00:53:07 for like, who else has done the cheat? Who else has done the secret cheat to get this game before
00:53:12 anyone else? And I don't think anyone else I met was. After, like after, like after some time,
00:53:19 we can like hang out. We can play Pokemon Go together. Maybe we can get a group together
00:53:23 and then we should do fucking Pokemon Go as the topic. Oh, of course. We were actually thinking
00:53:27 about doing that today, but you're like, um, well, it was originally just going to be me,
00:53:32 Tom and Hippo and Tom hasn't really played a lot of Pokemon Go and me and Hippo have said a lot
00:53:35 about Pokemon Go already, but I would love to do Pokemon Go episode someday. I think that would
00:53:39 be, because I have a lot to say about that. It's kind of weird how, uh, disharmonious our
00:53:45 Pokemon Go has been, because we all started at the same time when the game first came out.
00:53:49 Then you, Ben, uh, and Hippo kept playing for like a couple extra months, like like a pretty
00:53:56 long time after everyone else stopped playing. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I would go on Pokemon Go walks for
00:54:00 like a long time after. I never stopped and I never really stopped until I went all the way
00:54:05 through like that first really cold December. Like I was still going out even in the middle of the
00:54:09 night, like really cold. Like I just, I want to, I just want to catch Pokemon still. And you guys,
00:54:14 you guys were going strong and I had dropped off. And then everyone stopped playing because,
00:54:19 you know, it was like when Jota was out for a little bit or maybe even a little bit before that
00:54:22 and everyone's like, okay, enough of this game. It sucks. And then I picked up again right around
00:54:28 when, like, like a day or two before Rick Waze came back or when Rick Waze first came out rather.
00:54:35 You mean the third impact? Yeah, the third impact. And I turned the game and like there are these
00:54:40 things called raids and there's a ton of like new social features. I think it's completely
00:54:45 different. And the game is like really, really fun now. You know, there's hardly ever any glitches
00:54:51 or any like retarded shit like that. There's a few now that friends are out and friends doesn't
00:54:55 work as well as it should. But you know, whatever, whatever, it's mostly fine. And there's barely
00:55:00 any like game breaking glitches. And there's so many features that incentivize you meeting new
00:55:05 people in real life. It's fucking great. I absolutely adore it. Too bad San Diego kind of
00:55:09 sucks for the game. And it's not very funny. Here was no one talks to one another, but in
00:55:12 Boston, that should great. Oh, wait, teams, teams, hashtag team yellow, hashtag team yellow,
00:55:19 instinct instinct. Team mystic. Yeah, I was a mistake. Of course, of course, you're a mystic.
00:55:24 Yeah, Tom mystic. Yeah, we should have a fucking war. I mean, what can I say? Articuno is the best
00:55:29 bird. That's not even true. It is true. The other ones look like shit. And you know it. No, Articuno
00:55:36 has a long tall head and Zapdos is funny. He's a funny boy. Zapdos is a fucking big bird ass
00:55:43 mother fucker. Exactly. That's why I love him. That's what he is. And Moltres is a rubber chicken
00:55:47 that's on fire. Moltres does suck. I think I've told you before, but I routinely listen to your
00:55:54 Pokemon Go miniscule review just like regularly, just like every other week or so. I love that.
00:56:00 Yeah, I also I have watched rewatched it because you've said that and you said like Ethan really
00:56:05 likes it as well. And I've rewatched it and I agree. Like it has something like undeniably great
00:56:10 that I don't do anymore. I don't know how to recapture that gold. I don't know if you got it.
00:56:16 I don't know if you heard Ben, but because due to shiagans are too long to discuss, but basically
00:56:22 the entire world wide community of Pokemon Go has completed a set of like challenge ARG
00:56:28 challenges that Niantic has presented for us. And Ergo, we have unlocked a special bonus in the
00:56:33 game and next weekend shiny articuno will be out in raids. What color is shiny? Is he the yellow?
00:56:40 No, no, he's like he's like icy blue. He's like more light blue. He looks cool. Okay. Okay,
00:56:46 that's pretty cool. I did not have any legendaries. I've never caught a legendary. I got two articunos
00:56:53 from last week. I have three. I'm a fucking big boy. I think I think I'm the the what level are
00:57:01 you guys? I'm 32. I'm like 2026. I think I'm probably like 26 to get fucked. Oh, I'm not. Yeah,
00:57:11 well, get fucked yourself. That's all I have to say. I the annoying thing about like where I live
00:57:19 is there's this one park, and there's like five Pokestops. And if I want to do anything, I need
00:57:24 to like take the train into the center of London, where it's like unbelievable amounts of Pokestops
00:57:29 and there's too much stuff. But like it's still a day trip in and it's it's expensive and I don't
00:57:34 want to do it every day, but I want to do it every day because there's so many Pokestops.
00:57:38 So it's like I could even play normally just having a nice walk and not take it too seriously,
00:57:43 or I could take it incredibly seriously and take the train every day, which I kind of want to do,
00:57:47 but I can't because it's too much time investment. Look, you got to be the best like no one ever was.
00:57:53 So get your bitch ass. Oh, you're right. I will do it now.
00:57:59 That's why that you know what this this ties back to what we were saying before.
00:58:04 The reason why Boston's so good for Pokemon Go is that you can just ride everywhere you want
00:58:07 because that's good public transport. When you go and public transport are inherently linked.
00:58:11 Speaking of Pokemon, I hope you're all excited for the first ever Muck League tournament,
00:58:19 the first ever New Los Angeles City, aka New Milwaukee Muck League tournament. Are you guys
00:58:25 fucking pumped for it? I know I know basically nothing about it and I'm in it. So I can that
00:58:30 shows you how professional I look. I am a Muck master. I am deeply involved in the meta. I know
00:58:37 all the subtle the subtle nuances of raising, breeding and training mucks and battling. Did
00:58:45 I mention battling? The subtleties of the Muck trade are not to be trifled with. You are not to
00:58:50 oh you are not to underestimate the nuance that goes into training these blobs of gas and goo.
00:58:56 The Muck meta is subtle and nuanced. It is it is like it's a minute to learn a lifetime to master
00:59:05 is how I would describe. Graham is disallowed. I guess not. But why would you use one? You use
00:59:13 it just uh well they have like secret specials different moves. No there's no the Muck League
00:59:20 is all mucks. That's that's the Muck League rule. There's no little Muck League little cup though.
00:59:27 I mean sure I guess. The Grimy Cup. The Grimy Cup that's it that's cannon. All right well yeah
00:59:34 sure why not why not but but uh yeah the tournament it's on the it's on the 12th and we're uh we're
00:59:40 going to be commentating it on the rowdy fuckers twitch uh and I'm gonna win spoilers I fucking
00:59:47 crush it. I will probably lose but that's okay that's that's fine this is not a slime fest I have no
00:59:53 slime on the line. Guys me and Ben are about to require right first cop players after this.
00:59:58 Go watch right first cop players do that now do do that now. Oh god I forgot about that.
01:00:05 Oh are you not prepared? No I'm not prepared but I will explain why later and we'll probably
01:00:11 just have to do it anyway. Okay cool great yeah uh this is gonna sound like a basic big question
01:00:17 but it's not do you have do you guys have anything planned for this summer because I have an entire
01:00:24 theme this summer is themed for me this this summer this summer is is a is a new
01:00:29 type of experience it's the summer of pain because my mom my mom has recently retired
01:00:37 at least she's retired she's got a retirement bonus and and do and due to her poor money to
01:00:43 money management skills and also her extreme generosity she's offered to take the family
01:00:47 on several trips and these trips are numerous but also I I have many things I need to get done
01:00:55 this summer I have many a thing the projects they have they have had they have deadlines in my
01:00:58 brain for and so I have to manage my time between absolute decadency and pinging out on vacations
01:01:06 in various foreign countries such as Hawaii and Italy uh so I'm going there but but whenever
01:01:12 I'm not there I have to work harder than I've ever worked before in my entire life and the
01:01:16 and I've just been resulting and me waking up typing things in google docs and like and like
01:01:21 drawing little character designs and then passing out after like 15 hours of just trading like doing
01:01:27 nothing else other than that and it's been it's been a great experience it's a summer of pain
01:01:31 where I where I balance I balance the excruciating work agony that puts myself every single day and
01:01:39 and then the absolute decadence of like being on vacation and and seeing my friends and going
01:01:44 weird places that's my sorry tumour is my plan for the summer is to enter a kind of zen like state
01:01:52 where time passes without me even noticing uh during during with quality during which during
01:01:58 which art gets made um while I fucking don't even know about it uh yesterday I fucking yesterday
01:02:08 I fucking hopped on on twitch on the saint comic switch and I fucking banged out I banged out the
01:02:13 first I banged out the first new vapors page in a while uh threw that up in my fucking patreon
01:02:19 and I'm like yes I'm back I'm fucking back it's it's happening again um I'm I have a similar
01:02:26 vapors three soon vapors three is coming did I say dream I said uh plan uh plan for the summer
01:02:33 I have like big plans at the moment I have a whiteboard in my room and I haven't shown anybody
01:02:37 this uh like in a in an image or a video because it has like I've written down the entire end of
01:02:43 bail japan exactly what happens in what order and I'm currently going through and when I've done
01:02:48 like drawn a panel or like an an event I am I rub it off the board so as soon it will be clear and
01:02:55 then I can fill it with like a whole other thing that I'm doing but like I want to finish bail
01:02:59 jpe I want to I want to I want to get some hypocrite videos pumping out uh doing all doing all that
01:03:05 stuff I'm organizing my life I'm getting I'm getting used to using calendars for the first
01:03:10 time in my entire life by actually like setting reminders like everybody says all the phone apps
01:03:15 and the things baps and the they say set reminders and notifications and I'm like uh no thanks but
01:03:21 this time I'm doing it I'm doing it and I'm doing it like properly and I'm smart and I'm a good boy
01:03:28 and I'm a big boy and I'm not gonna shit around for a whole other summer and I'm not gonna play
01:03:34 world of warcraft I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna work I'm gonna work hard uninstall world of warcraft
01:03:39 never again never return I uninstalled it like every year I also have to get used to calendars
01:03:45 where I've actually like like funnily enough someone actually gifted me the homestuck calendar this
01:03:51 like like like last christmas I'm like oh thank you thank you uh and it's just been you know
01:03:57 wasting away but I've actually broken it out for the summer of pain so I can see how many days I
01:04:02 have to work with uh and and it's kind of weird being aware of your surrounding it's like bizarre
01:04:10 knowing what's happening in your life whereas before I would just have to guess like oh yeah I'm
01:04:14 recording something in like two days I think at like three but no I can just I just write it down
01:04:22 and it will be there and I'm like oh I'm doing something tomorrow I know my life is in my own
01:04:27 hands I'm not I'm not a passive passenger yeah I'm actually doing things in my life it feels it
01:04:33 feels good to to have even just a little bit of a plan of like yes during this day I will do this
01:04:40 vague thing like even that is nice to just know all right because like I've mapped out my days at
01:04:45 the moment I'm doing like YouTube stuff and then also like writing stuff like writing for for secret
01:04:52 projects that I don't know that I don't really kind of talk about but like uh for for like other
01:04:57 real big boy things such as uh scripts for tv and film lol sick so I'm sorry like I've mapped out my
01:05:08 days like okay Monday Wednesday Friday I will do this and then Tuesday Thursday I will do the other
01:05:13 thing and by switching to and fro I will keep things fresh but also be making progress every day
01:05:20 and not be doing the same thing for days on end you know like every time I get stuck on something
01:05:26 the next day I'm going to be doing something else anyway so like it's not a problem
01:05:30 and it's and it's been working pretty well so far the beauty of having multiple projects I don't
01:05:36 I do not space my time like you do I probably should that's probably the best but it's kind of
01:05:42 for me it just I know I have to work for this certain amount of hours every single day because
01:05:45 this is how much I've calculated is a good idea uh and so I'll do this uh for like you know like
01:05:52 like 10 hours or something or whatever it's just not you however many hours but the beauty of having
01:05:57 multiple projects is that a lot of the time in in my youth I would start something and then I would
01:06:05 have everything open and I would be working and then I would hit like like a stump or some sort of
01:06:09 block and I would be like I don't want to do this like this is really hard and like I nothing's
01:06:15 coming to me right now and I can't I can't get the juices flowing and then I would just sit there
01:06:18 twiddling my clip thinking about how hard it is for like an hour or something wasting time
01:06:23 but now I just realized when okay shit's not happening right now I'm I don't want to waste
01:06:28 my time I'm just gonna do my other project while I wait for my brain to refuel so I can do the other
01:06:32 thing so I never have moments where I'm just like ooh I don't want to do this it's always I'm
01:06:37 constantly making things and I can and I and I'm not afraid to switch off of something and do something
01:06:42 else in the meantime I will I recharge my spirit I mean the way I do it is like it's easier to to
01:06:49 swap after a night of sleep because like if I try to swap during the day I'm constantly thinking
01:06:55 maybe I shouldn't have swapped maybe if I waited for another couple of hours I would have figured
01:06:59 it out what I was trying to do and I'm still the previous project I was doing in the morning
01:07:03 is still in my mind as I'm trying to switch to a different project in the afternoon so like I like
01:07:08 to even if I can't get anything done that day because I was a bad day I I instead uh you know
01:07:14 I I try my best and then if I can't get anything done that's that that day is it's done but at
01:07:20 least I tried next day I know that I'm flipping I know that I'm doing something else and by the
01:07:26 time it comes to the day after that it's usually like oh yeah yeah I can do this and then because
01:07:33 I don't I don't like leaving like niggling thoughts in the back of my head of like oh maybe this or
01:07:39 maybe that I want to have a good old sleep for just like slice the slice my time in half slice
01:07:48 slice slice moments of life with sleep days I think they're called I would do that but going to
01:07:56 like like laying down in bed is always the worst experience of my entire life it's the scariest
01:08:01 thing I have to deal with a day in day out because every time I lay down in bed I'm like
01:08:05 did I do did I do enough today did I spend my time wisely am I am I on track am I not on track
01:08:11 what am I doing wrong how should I kill myself and I just have thoughts like that like like
01:08:15 routinely just over and over again until I like somehow fall asleep so I don't ever want to sleep
01:08:20 if I don't have to dude when I feel like that which is often I go outside and I have a midnight
01:08:26 walk and I catch a Pokemon or two on the way I I would like to do that I don't think my area is
01:08:32 very good I live in a little bit of a shanty town a little bit I live in the outskirts of society
01:08:38 would you get stabbed I would get maybe a rape or two one or two when I get when I get done
01:08:44 recording shit today I might I might go out for a little Pokemon little Pokemon John just catch a
01:08:50 couple because I know that there you can catch some around my house like around the corners they
01:08:55 appear they appear in your nightmares of the corner of your eye you can't feel in the periphery of my
01:09:01 consciousness uh uh shit I was gonna say something else uh oh yeah about sleep uh yeah I hate going
01:09:08 to okay I hate going to sleep because going to sleep is like admitting that I'm done for the day
01:09:12 and then I know oh yeah and it's never it's never enough I've never done enough um but you know
01:09:18 what uh so the other earlier this week I was uh revamping my website to make it easier to edit
01:09:26 in the future and also to add um Bscapades which is there now Bscapades or what what is done of it
01:09:33 is on stcomics.com baby anyway yeah yeah well it took me so fucking long like it took me way
01:09:41 longer than I thought it would um partially for like technical reasons partially just because
01:09:46 there was like just that much that needed to be changed um for it but also so yeah I was trying
01:09:54 to do it because I went into this project thinking there'd be maybe like two three four maybe five
01:10:00 hours to get this all done uh so and then like I'm doing it for like 10 hours straight yeah and then
01:10:06 it's like you know it's really late in the night and it's like 3 a.m and I'm like way past my bedtime
01:10:12 and like I've been awake for like 24 hours straight and I'm like hmm but I'm not done yet so I just
01:10:19 keep going and I just don't sleep and I work like and I work all through that night and like all the
01:10:23 next day and you know it ends up taking me three full days to do it and partially that's just now
01:10:33 you might say well I stayed up all night so I got eight hours to work on it but I didn't get
01:10:38 but I was going real slow by the end there I was like you know I was getting easily distracted I was
01:10:45 like losing my focus forgetting what I was doing I don't think that I saved time get this good news
01:10:51 flash guys incredible fucking hot take from Ben St um sleepy is good for you and if you don't sleep
01:10:58 you will be unfocused and unable to do things that's peak efficiency yeah that that is just like
01:11:04 hashtag just team thing who you've just said to me that is like the most relatable thing I've
01:11:08 ever felt because whenever I'm sleeping I've been working for a really long time and it's always
01:11:14 like I've gotten to the point where it's where I start to feel the experience that I've been that
01:11:18 I explained before where it's like oh I'm stuck I'm stuck here there's a there's a creative problem
01:11:22 here that I'm not thinking of the solution because it's been like 10 hours since I started working
01:11:26 on this exact one project and now I'm all burned out and then after a while I just have to admit like
01:11:32 listen it's like 3 a.m. I have to go to bed I'm not I'm not getting anything done yeah yeah yeah
01:11:38 yeah you're not getting anything done and there's no reason to be awake but that's the worst that's
01:11:42 the worst feeling is when it is you walk away it feels bad but it's what you gotta do it's it's
01:11:47 like like when when you like when you're on a streak and like overwatch or something like you're
01:11:51 you're doing a lot of commuter like competitive games over and over again you're on a high streak
01:11:55 and then you lose one and you're like well I guess I have I guess I should go to bed
01:12:00 yeah but I lost one so so I feel like I'm an asshole and like I've like I've lost my entire life
01:12:06 the worst I to to get over this sort of exact feeling I've just accepted that when I'm mad
01:12:14 and I'm done uh rage quitting is okay and should be done like regularly like if you if you feel the
01:12:21 need to rage quit do it don't be worried about like people calling you a little baby my problem
01:12:26 with rage quit people who don't even know what you're doing right now and that's no way to judge
01:12:30 you yeah well I understand that then I do I'm just saying it's you know it's funny it's funny
01:12:36 that our brains think that when I rage quit like art the problem is I just keep thinking about it
01:12:40 even after I've raged like I get it out but then it's still there and then I'll just go back and
01:12:45 keep working on it like I can't stop I have this I mean this is like it has to be fixed there's
01:12:51 definitely a balance for like if you you're thinking like I'm so close but I think the the main
01:12:57 thing is like if you're tired um just go to bed like if you can't keep your eyes open then start
01:13:03 I'm pretty good at sleeping I hate it but it feels good so that usually over rules I don't really go
01:13:10 to bed until I'm like having trouble keeping my eyes open and maybe that's I mean I don't really go
01:13:17 to bed late I just sort of I'm sleepy a lot of the time but like um I don't go to bed at like
01:13:24 my bedtime I just go to bed when I feel done for the day so I don't really have all these problems
01:13:30 I used to I definitely used to have all of these problems I don't know why or how it changed
01:13:36 but I just sort of like okay I'm tired well I'll figure it out I'll figure it out rage quit life
01:13:43 I I definitely I definitely like like especially nowadays in the summer of pain I've definitely come
01:13:50 to the cushion like you know when it hits like specifically around like 11 to 12 30 I that that's
01:13:59 definitely like like the graveyard of like of like my my productivity for that day that's definitely
01:14:04 when I'm when I start to do my worst and you know I start to feel like rage quitty so I definitely
01:14:11 like now where I want to maximize all the time the sooner you go to bed the sooner you can wake up
01:14:15 so around there yeah at my hard bedtime yeah you got you got it you got to just accept you just got
01:14:21 to accept that it's what has to happen you don't be it don't be a coward get some sleep it's a
01:14:29 harsh thing you can do but you gotta do it yeah yeah um beautiful do anything else this is pretty
01:14:36 good this this felt pretty good this felt like refreshing this felt like I was engaging in a
01:14:41 conversation that was not blind me but like you know blowing me by this felt like I like I was
01:14:45 actually participating in an evolving conversation that mattered if I was there not and like it
01:14:50 wasn't just completely dependent on a few like members steam rolling things and all approaching
01:14:55 a topic from various different angles yeah it was great um we'll send you we'll send you your
01:15:00 court summons tomorrow smash cut to me being kicked from the pcp next week oh no hey uh nothing
01:15:11 like I wanted to talk about dogs because I've got a dog I don't there's nothing to do with anything
01:15:18 like um he's a puppy and he's a very funny puppy boy and he likes rolling upside down on his back
01:15:24 and like uh I grab his paws and he does a funny little like puppy movement and he's really cute
01:15:30 and he's adorable and I love him and um I feel like I was wondering about like crazy cat ladies
01:15:39 and why it's always crazy cat ladies not crazy dog ladies oh and it's because and it's because
01:15:45 dogs force you to be real people it's it's like dogs train you to be like uh like a parent but
01:15:52 without having to have a kid you have to take care of it and it loves you but you have to you know
01:15:57 you have to go outside you have to do things it can't it can't work on its own isn't it's not a
01:16:02 it's not a person it's not a cat a cat is like another person cats cats are like passive ownership
01:16:07 they take care of like 99 percent of their own cats cats are like roommates you know you give them
01:16:12 a little bit of food and then you can stroke them and that's their their rent money and and you
01:16:20 you know and but dogs they just they're fucking stupid idiots but they're adorable and they're great
01:16:25 um and I I like him I don't like either one I think that I think that dogs are just like you
01:16:35 have to fucking micromanage a dog it's it's ridiculous like in hindsight like I owned a dog
01:16:41 I owned dogs as a kid and it's like it wasn't so bad because there were five people in my family
01:16:45 so we split like walking duties but like you gotta like take your dog out to shit like multiple
01:16:51 times a day are you fucking kidding me no never um and cats are just well I don't I don't I don't
01:17:00 see the appeal I they're cute I guess I think like dogs definitely it's easier when there's multiple
01:17:08 people in the house like I don't own a dog it is the family dog and it's like I've never picked up
01:17:14 the poopy and put it in the bag yet I I've avoided that um by just not taking him on walks when
01:17:20 he's likely to be doing that and I've got I've gotten away with it mum usually has has the poopy
01:17:26 bags I'm like yeah very very very good you do it and not me and as soon as I have to do that I'll
01:17:33 be like fucking dogs suck I fucking hate dogs I'll come in I'll just shit all over my hands
01:17:41 I have numerous dogs my I mean you know my family has uh and I hate them I hate them I hate them
01:17:49 well they fuck a lot I I fucking hate I hate I hate pets I just I hate pets and I never okay okay
01:17:55 I I like pets I like animals but my dogs specifically are are demons not of their own
01:18:02 ill will not not they have done nothing wrong the problem with my dogs is that primarily my mom
01:18:09 has trained them and no ill wish on my mom but she's one of the people that's like
01:18:14 squirting dogs with water is abuse and like that's too harsh yeah so obviously predictably the
01:18:23 dogs are not trained at all like they have no training they have no sense of like you tell them
01:18:29 no they won't stop because they aren't trained to know that no means no they they are rapist by design
01:18:36 yeah yeah my my dog's my dog uh it it was starting off like that like it would chew on
01:18:43 everything and my mom was like um trying to like she she heard somewhere that if you treat it if you
01:18:49 give it a treat when it's doing the right thing then it will do the right thing you don't have to
01:18:53 punish it and I continually saw him being a cunt like deliberately being a little shit
01:18:58 and knowing that he could get away with things and I I was like the first one to punish him
01:19:03 I picked him up and I put him in his little dog cage and I locked it and I didn't let him out
01:19:07 even when he whined and and when he calmed down then I let him out and he immediately after that
01:19:13 like things have been like as as soon as that was like established as a thing like
01:19:18 if he tries to jump up on the table and take out plates of food you put him in the cage
01:19:22 and he feels and he's like wow I'm I want your food I want it I'm I entitled to that food uh it
01:19:29 smells nice and no and he's been he's been getting good he's a good boy now here's the thing about
01:19:35 fucking dogs is that they love it they love being trained they love having discipline that's what
01:19:41 dogs were bred for was to have like they're like they're like Pokemon yeah exactly they need a human
01:19:48 to mat to dominate them so they can reach their full potential yeah I give him some dog candies I
01:19:53 power him up and then I take him to the gym yeah it's it's actually true so there's no reason to
01:20:00 be like oh you can't punish dogs and that's what they've been they've evolved to do that they've
01:20:06 evolved to take punishment and learn from their mistakes if they didn't take punishment you
01:20:14 tell them no and they fucking bite your hand off yeah like dogs don't do that they are like oh I'm
01:20:19 sure I I didn't know but they knew whenever you meet a bad dog just know that the owner has
01:20:29 fucked up and they don't want to train it right and they're doing like weird bizarre practices
01:20:33 where they're trying to hype the dog up and then they have weird power dynamics it's just retarded
01:20:38 dogs are all great if you just know how to train them if you're patient and you and you know
01:20:42 you're a good leader a lot of people don't they either like dogs because they're cute and they're
01:20:46 like yeah I could use dog right now and they just get one flippantly and they're like well hello dog
01:20:51 welcome to the house I don't want to train you yeah I want to treat animals like stuffed animals
01:20:57 are the worst like no it's not here to to be a comfort item yeah that's what I was that's why
01:21:04 I was thinking about like crazy cat ladies because the cats are stuffed animals that you just have
01:21:08 to feed occasionally yeah and and like if somebody owns a cat I'm like okay well let's see let's see
01:21:14 where this goes but if they own a dog then I'm like okay this person's cool this person clearly
01:21:19 knows something unless the dog is like crazy and rabid like if the dog is just like a normal dog
01:21:24 then I'm like okay I can trust this human being because they know what they're doing
01:21:27 they have some semblance of like like discipline and order in order to discipline the dog
01:21:34 my cousin in Denver who's a stoner uh that that right that rival is digi and he's high 24 seven
01:21:42 and he has us he he quote unquote draws but I've seen his sketchbook and it literally not a joke
01:21:49 this is not funny it literally just is a lot of like naked girls with poor anatomy and the middle
01:21:54 school s drawn over and over again that's pretty funny yeah uh he has like three big dogs he's like
01:22:03 a pit bull and like a german shepherd and some other one but it's funnily enough he actually
01:22:08 has trained them really well and they're actually really well behaved and they don't fuck around
01:22:12 with anything and they don't jump up on anything and and you know there's you know he can tell
01:22:16 him to do things and then listen to him so even a stoner can do it you have no excuse you have no
01:22:21 excuse you fucking cucks who don't want to raise a hand to a dog they need it they love it they
01:22:26 want to serve you let them be your slave they desperately want it
01:22:34 oh you don't think it's dogs no no interest no interest in pets of any kind they're just too
01:22:39 much effort I respect my time too much to waste it uh uh training an animal
01:22:47 yeah I don't mind people who who like don't have the time but like implicitly like in my brain if
01:22:53 I see somebody with a dog I respect them just a little bit more than like a random person who
01:22:57 doesn't have a dog or it's not me a cat or something wait walking the cat I see that and I'm
01:23:03 like don't you have anything better to do it's not that I it's not that I don't have the time it's
01:23:07 that I don't want to spend any time because I don't see what I get out of it uh you get a cute dog
01:23:13 that you can waggle his face great he's got fluffy ears and you can move the fluffy ears around and
01:23:20 then you can pick them up and you can you can that's not gonna get me any subscribers I I might
01:23:26 enjoy petting a dog maybe once a month this random person on the street will not benefit my subscriber
01:23:31 base in any way I see I see no reason to vlog at aka you know recognize it as reality there's no
01:23:39 reason to engage with this person if I can't blog it's not about engaging with no no it's
01:23:44 about owning I'm talking about owning a dog like owning a dog I would get I would get to pet the
01:23:48 dog what am I gonna pet the dog every day fucking I'll get bored I'm gonna get bored of that shit
01:23:55 I think I think I'll just be petting this dog I'll be petting this hypothetical dog it'll just be
01:24:00 like uh again and like the same as yesterday lap dogs have been so cupped from every aspect of
01:24:11 their fucking life they've been evolved to be these shitty little things and pugs can sneeze
01:24:17 their eyeballs out and they've been deformed and all their spines are fucked up and they're and
01:24:21 they've just been made small and smaller so they're cuter and cuter and their bodies function less
01:24:26 and less and on top of that the people who buy lap dogs are always the ones who don't want to punish
01:24:32 dogs so there's just these shitty little barking assholes they just roam around sneezing their
01:24:38 eyeballs out and barking at strangers from across the door and I hate it it's just a sign it's just
01:24:44 a sign that the person who's done this is a jerk and a meaning I don't like them because they're
01:24:48 they're supporting uh pugs sneezing eyeballs out and also they probably have no backbone or
01:24:54 marble fiber uh I do think pugs are pretty cute but but you're right their eyeballs at the pugs are
01:25:03 like they like a real life meme face that people like bread to look like that like they they they
01:25:11 he was the original rage face he was the original reaction image before they invented before they
01:25:17 invented tablets people's canvas was their dog's DNA give it a for it give it a couple decades people
01:25:24 would have like bred nyan cats to be like real oh my oh my oh my word how devilish my my lord you

01:34:19 called deep 69 it was it was a song all right I like the the snare drum it sounded like you were
01:34:28 slapping a sandal to another sandal it was like bap it was a bit of generic rock I you know like it
01:34:38 felt like a quake game sort of thing but they made this sweet little video explaining you know who

01:36:53 it's decided here's here's the next uh just send it to the twitter just in case wait one more time
01:36:59 one more time me too as in I watch the pcp as well right that will work okay there we go uh here's
01:37:08 by wings of strife pcb intro main entry come on everyone sit down with me you know i'm supposed
01:37:19 to be working but instead I'm watching pcb whoa okay okay it sounded that has a lot going on it sounded
01:37:30 real that that was really short it was sounds like a radio jingle yeah I like that one podcast
01:37:39 dilly dilly d pcp ding and here we are um that works I I really like that one I think that might be
01:37:45 top that might be top of the list for me yeah I don't have a top of the list I do like it though
01:37:50 I I like I like the concept of it the execution could be a little bit better okay just just I like
01:37:56 how short it is I'm reading I like how I'm reading the tweet here it says I also provided three other
01:38:00 versions for your convenience and utility you'll find them linked in the descriptions of the main entry
01:38:06 wait like huh okay hold on let me let me investigate this
01:38:12 there oh so there's an instrumental then there is instrumental then words one loop each then there
01:38:18 is an instrumental with three loops exactly so I guess it's just it's just in case we need to be
01:38:24 a looping thing that is handy that is that that's actually really nice I think this is the first
01:38:31 I think this is the person that that's realized the sort of like like like like what we're looking
01:38:37 for yeah for what we're looking for in the sense that we want how we want an intro to be
01:38:42 the yeah okay I mean first like a real intro intro this is the first um I mean it's 15
01:38:48 seconds long uh which is like I mean I think the ideal intro is like five seconds but this is like
01:38:53 you know most are the entries we get are like a minute long two minutes or whatever which is great
01:38:58 and everything I'm remembering that one from last time where it was like built made up of like
01:39:03 news reports of people saying the word PCP and stuff yes and I'd like I'd like that like
01:39:09 feeling if that was like 15 seconds it's good if if if only if only we had something else
01:39:17 this is basically what I'm saying uh then we have this by by by famous uh person Ben Smeals
01:39:27 Ben Smeals is here I quite like wait wait Ben Smeals is a real person yeah and and and I quite
01:39:34 like the I thought he was just a cruel joke at my expense no no he's real
01:39:37 this picture
01:39:50 this is a sonic level it's curvy level bro oh no I failed it in the game
01:39:56 I don't I don't know if that's a PCP intro but that's definitely I'm definitely saving that
01:40:08 using that for my own devices I definitely love that uh make sure not to give credit to Ben Smeals
01:40:15 because he's a slur against look at that look at that cover look at that cover pretty yeah it's
01:40:21 it's gorgeous show what it show notes guy show the cover editor show the cover or something
01:40:28 whatever delicious uh it didn't really have a whole wait wait is this Ben Smeals by Doon
01:40:33 Coon or is this Doon Coon by Ben Smeals oh wait oh you nerd Ben yeah Ben Smeals is the name of the
01:40:40 song wait why why wait why is that the name of the song because I apparently Smeal well okay
01:40:48 that's Ben Smeals daily uh what Ben Smeals is Doon Coon
01:40:57 Doon Coon Ben Smeals is is merely a statement of fact okay okay uh well I liked it I liked it I did
01:41:06 like I did like it but I don't know about it as an intro then we have I mean I would put it in
01:41:11 the pc I would use it in stuff anyway we have this by Alex Siebel it's it's it's it's Alex
01:41:29 I reckon I don't watch the videos well it says PCP I've never seen anything this beautiful
01:41:42 I wonder what happens if I touch
01:41:44 if I keep fucking around I'll never make anything decent for the contest
01:42:14 here's what you do Alex you take the stems of that song keep everything
01:42:28 exactly the same in that song but you change the words PCP to RFCK and then
01:42:33 you send that to the RFCK yeah you'll be on album number two wait Alex you wrote
01:42:42 a song and I think it is not on the discord you wrote a song and I did it
01:42:46 did not make it on to the first Rowdy fuckers fan album but I want it I want
01:42:51 it on there you know I don't know why I'm asking you this publicly on the PCP I
01:42:54 could just fucking send you a discord message but I find this to be a more
01:42:58 fun and interesting way of going about back shady back room dealings in the
01:43:05 most public way possible yeah yeah yeah exactly those are the themes we have so
01:43:09 far I think the best one of this batch was probably 15 second one follow
01:43:16 closely by the I am quesadilla which one was iron quesadilla the fucking the one
01:43:24 with the three cabieros oh yeah I iron quesadilla not I am quesadilla no I am
01:43:32 quesadilla iron iron iron quesadilla where are you getting iron from I that's
01:43:38 what you're saying you're saying iron quesadilla I don't know I don't know
01:43:43 what you're going on about but I will not stand for it whatsoever alright yeah
01:43:48 I'm gonna yeah wings wings of strife wings of strife is on the fucking like
01:43:55 that's the kind of thing that I want and that like that's the kind of thing I
01:43:58 mean look we're getting all these really great things like like like Alex's
01:44:02 thing Alex's song and the bench meals like these are all really great and I
01:44:06 would use them but not as an intro unless maybe like we cut out like a chunk
01:44:11 of them guys I've had like an amazing idea yeah what we should do we get all
01:44:17 these themes and then when the deadline for themes is ended we would we have to
01:44:21 like choose one or like you know we'll put pit them against each other we should
01:44:26 assign them to like a Smash Brothers tournament computer people and and see
01:44:32 which theme is is the better yeah but I'm just you know like they they get
01:44:43 that one day of like the PCP theme Royal Rumble so yeah but like a Smash
01:44:49 Brothers tournament we make we make wrestling characters based on the
01:44:54 track art free song and we see who wins and then that person like becomes that
01:45:01 becomes like the theme for the next episode but not like forever that's
01:45:06 like the the funny little prize or we alternatively we do nothing here's a
01:45:13 new section and by a new section I mean what I originally wanted the feedback
01:45:17 the feedback section to be aka not a hardly defined section and just a thing
01:45:22 that I was thinking about that relate to the fan reaction the last episode that I
01:45:26 would bring up because I care about and not because I'm obligated to do it because
01:45:29 it's now a new section on the show so Dane I recently I was doing like an
01:45:34 overhaul of the PCP Patreon lounge because it was kind of languishing and
01:45:38 getting dusty and don't really talking in it because it wasn't really that
01:45:40 entertaining and there wasn't really a whole lot of room for discussion so I
01:45:43 added both an off-topics chat as well as the suggestions of offer feedback and
01:45:49 we actually got I did the suggestions chat in the RFCK discord but due to the
01:45:55 nature of the RFCK it was all just suggestions for the game of endless
01:45:59 war and a whole lot of memes suggestions really what were they supposed to be
01:46:03 suggestions for just for like actually the show like like like you know the ways
01:46:07 to improve the show and slash or the discord itself okay but I did this in
01:46:12 the patient lounge and that sort of thing actually did happen so there was a
01:46:15 lot of interesting well-thought-out points regarding the show in various
01:46:21 different ways one of which by Dane good friend of mine I'm going to read this
01:46:26 one specifically because it's related to the section of the theme so quote from
01:46:31 Dane as you're probably aware the current PCP theme is iconic there's a
01:46:36 direct correlation between everyone making correlation everyone makes
01:46:40 between those notes and the procrastinators as a brand I think that
01:46:43 keeping the old melody as a light motif would be a great way to ensure that you
01:46:47 don't have to start over in the process of rebuilding a deep association with
01:46:50 the brand as well as avoiding alienating fans with changes that aren't 100%
01:46:54 necessary this would also allow experimentation for known interesting
01:46:59 ways to set the mood for the show or situation may also be a good idea to use
01:47:04 it in either the intro or outro theme or if there must be completely new one also
01:47:09 you may want to oh they was just in like fucking retarded shit but yeah I said
01:47:14 that I just didn't use the word like motif when I said it but yeah well that
01:47:17 was you that was your biggest mistake yes that's where you put that so I did
01:47:22 but yeah I agree with that yes I do as well Dane he's on the right I don't
01:47:30 think it's necessary I don't think it's necessary for a theme but I think that
01:47:34 it is not it would it would help the decision if it's like oh yeah it's the
01:47:40 PCP theme but it sounds like this I didn't I didn't initially think about
01:47:45 this but I but I'll probably want to read a few of these suggestions pretty
01:47:49 on the show because they've actually been really insightful surprisingly like
01:47:53 right off the bat there's been a few that have been like a couple paragraphs
01:47:56 longs by various different people by various different aspects of the show
01:47:59 and all of them were insightful in some way or another and it was really actually
01:48:03 kind of great to see so I'm extremely happy about that and I'll probably read
01:48:07 some that I think are interested in or that I think it should be passed along
01:48:11 to the guys in episodes so look forward to that oh another one for me what's
01:48:16 this don't go into every section on every episode
01:48:26 but how are we going to community build
01:48:36 I mean I mean the PCB themes one is like kind of because it's like finite it will end
01:48:42 forever and we will have done I don't know at this rate like at this rate
01:48:46 well we already have a deadline for when it stops wait yeah I forget when it is
01:48:52 the end of this month we got a whole month to go but like four more episodes and then we're there
01:48:57 we're done so that one we should continue doing until it's over but like others we don't always
01:49:04 have to do the fan art section if there's not a lot of fan art or like you know we should just
01:49:10 allude to it should be like we got some good fan art we saw it all there's this piece in
01:49:16 in particular that I think is interesting that we should bring up and if not there's no reason
01:49:20 to bring it up there's no reason to have that segment if there's nothing interesting to say
01:49:22 about it if we're just saying this was good this was good this was good yeah uh the questions new
01:49:30 segment new new old segment let's just do like like like one let's just fucking do one can we even
01:49:38 find a good one no I mean let's look let's look yeah I'm looking we look for a pity question on
01:49:43 the twitter are you looking on twitter should I look on twitter I didn't even ask on twitter
01:49:47 they're usually not that good so I just asked in the patreon lounge what's the hashtag pcp questions
01:49:53 yeah or ask ask the pcp I think I think ask pcp yeah oh or is it ask pcp here's a really great one
01:50:01 by by uh arrows and how much how much would munch could munchy munch if munchy could munch munchies
01:50:09 that's really great thank you for typing that thank you for your time
01:50:16 uh
01:50:26 yeah questions much I got a question what do we ask what do we ask for questions isn't that the
01:50:35 question uh beyond sorry dude there's there's this one guy in the patreon that's literally
01:50:40 asking us if we would be a cuck for money that's really funny that's he that's actually the question
01:50:46 he's asking if you're doing it is it is it still cuckled or if you're doing it for money I don't
01:50:50 know okay well I don't I don't want to give me uh I mean you know that that's the kind of thing I
01:50:57 think about on the daily yeah yeah I mean that that's an interesting like hypothetical suck my
01:51:02 suck my big pp asks prostate massage yes or no yes definitely I feel like we already got that
01:51:10 question before too and wait really oh well my my eyes just went right to it so well that says a lot
01:51:17 does the okay does the ends justify the means from chaotic slaw in all circumstances just
01:51:26 blanket statement yes of course there's no way that question of course yes yes capital yes
01:51:38 doombox two asks dad it's me it's me son it's me I'm here now
01:51:47 god go to your fucking room I'm here and come up with better questions here on here on patreon.com
01:51:57 yes because all children patron their fathers I mean that's that's how that's how you get
01:52:03 money out of them why why have a kid if not to make them a patron uh see Katie asks if you had to plot
01:52:13 the convoluted murder of another pcp member at radcon for would you how who would you kill and how
01:52:19 would you do it who would be the easy to kill you probably the easiest to kill it bro I don't know
01:52:26 I don't think so away I can crawl away up the walls and and on the fences okay I have an answer
01:52:32 to this but it's pretty I think it'll be pretty boring like duh did you would be the easiest
01:52:38 to kill because you'd be high on weed bro you just replace this weed with crack weed we just put
01:52:45 some fucking yeah we just we just put we just swap out his weed with some poison weed or it's
01:52:51 failing that we just wait until he's high and then we sneak up on him and stab him when his reflexes
01:52:55 are I think all this would be easier to kill I don't think any of us really put up that much of
01:53:00 fight I mean I mean no that's true we're also like vulnerable and squishy if someone just like
01:53:06 like if someone just got the jump on us we'd be dead instantaneously just from fear alone
01:53:14 yeah I mean all of our organs and that's that's why that's why we can never ever release we can
01:53:20 never release the the location of radcon four because if anyone decided to attack us like we
01:53:25 would just drop we would fall like dominoes we're not prepared for attacks of any kind
01:53:30 assault or other we we have no fortifications we are laid bare on the land
01:53:39 it's sad really uh yeah really fun did you or hippo neg would probably be the hardest
01:53:48 Nate or me probably uh dude who would win a fight Nate or Monchi um Nate's uh Nate's strong
01:53:58 but he's also a bitch Nate can't squat for shit Nate would follow Nate just tips over
01:54:05 in the slightest breeze he's all he's all show I think Nate would probably win I think that makes
01:54:13 the most sense we need to have like a real cage fight I don't know I mean I mean a royal rumble
01:54:20 in real life kill each other like the winner is the the the last one alive the arena was real
01:54:25 have you the royal rumble in real life Monchi have you like ever like been in a fight yeah I I've
01:54:32 been multiple did I tell you did I tell you guys on air or off air yeah I told I told you on air
01:54:37 about how uh one time a high school junior was bullying me and I was in fourth grade and I beat
01:54:43 the shit out of them no oh wait wait yes you did yeah I do remember that that's right that's right
01:54:49 um I mean I think I mean you know what like the fact of life yeah Nate works out and everything
01:54:55 but like the fact of life is that just like fucking momentum like fucking just fucking like
01:55:01 just like a height and weight advantage it's like overwhelming like it kind of doesn't matter if
01:55:05 you work out I honestly I think just from size alone I could see you winning you just need to swing
01:55:13 a big tree log like Whom whack him and like also Nate's never been in a fight which you know
01:55:21 neither have I so you know I'm not not judging or anything but that's just that's just the
01:55:25 cold hard facts that actually I don't know if that's true but I'm pretty sure it's I think I've
01:55:29 only been in one or two like real fights and then I've been I've been in a dozen or so fake
01:55:34 playfights but I still beat the shit out of whoever challenged me now I'm just imagining like like
01:55:39 the same like like Radcon 3 arena with the go pros but instead we're like picking up random
01:55:44 objects like smashing bottles and like like going around the house like trying to kill each other
01:55:49 dude like that it's such a vivid sight in my head like seeing that like with the GoPro footage
01:55:53 everyone just like like the stakes are so much higher in round three wrestling is honestly the
01:56:00 funnest thing in the entire fucking world the funnest thing to do as a kid when I was in like
01:56:04 you know elementary school was I would bring out I would bring over some friends and we would just
01:56:08 all wrestle a hardcore we would get on my bed and we would all just like wrestle as hard as we
01:56:12 fucking could we would push each other against the walls we the optimal strat would always to
01:56:17 be able to like like lay on your back and like get your legs up and you would be able to kick
01:56:21 as hard as you could and then and then we'd kiss a little bit yeah and then there'd be some you
01:56:24 know it just just just for a laugh just just to make up just just to make up for the you know the
01:56:30 trauma that we've been you know inflicting on one another we take our shirts off well because
01:56:34 that we get too hot we live we live in Coronado so you know you would you would just you know
01:56:37 take your shirt off you know we get kind of sweaty so we'd like we'd wipe each other down you know
01:56:41 we get in the shower together afterwards you know good good times in kindergarten
01:56:49 nothing nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing there's nothing wrong with being gay
