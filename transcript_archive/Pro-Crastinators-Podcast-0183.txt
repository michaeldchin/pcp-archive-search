00:00:00 1, 2, 3, sync!
00:00:06 And one more time. 1, 2, 3, sync!
00:00:09 I never got my apple juice.
00:00:11 Dab.
00:00:12 Sorry. Are you getting apple juice?
00:00:13 It's okay. It's okay. It's too late.
00:00:15 This is the first time hearing about apple juice.
00:00:18 Anyway, welcome to the Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:22 Yeah, hello everybody. We're here. That's the episode.
00:00:25 What do you know? It already started. Who could have predicted this thing?
00:00:27 Welcome to the Apple Juice Cast.
00:00:29 Remember Apple Jacks? The cereal.
00:00:32 Here's my hot take. As a child, didn't much care for apple juice. I don't know why.
00:00:38 As an adult, I find it almost too delicious, almost too sweet.
00:00:43 I find the flavor of apple juice to be intense, and it's strange.
00:00:48 When I was a kid, I didn't like apple juice at all.
00:00:52 As an adult, I drink it and I'm like, whoa!
00:00:55 That sounds stupid, but I'm being completely genuine.
00:00:58 I'm almost on the same boat, though.
00:01:00 When I was a kid, I used to like the mixed fruit or whatever.
00:01:05 It was a 2D fruity something.
00:01:07 Wild berry punch.
00:01:08 No, no, no. It's mixed fruit. All of the fruits are together.
00:01:12 Right now, when I taste it, it's too sweet and kind of watered down.
00:01:17 So I really dislike it.
00:01:19 But apple juice, though. Apple juice is the god of the juices.
00:01:22 I love it so much. It's so good.
00:01:24 It's pressed apple juice. It's the most delicious juice of all.
00:01:27 I know. We're raised orange juice boys, and orange juice remains king of juices.
00:01:33 No. Orange juice has rained for too long.
00:01:37 I prefer orange juice.
00:01:39 I prefer orange juice growing up.
00:01:42 I think I probably still prefer it, but grapefruit juice is my thing.
00:01:48 Grapefruit juice is my favorite.
00:01:50 I also like cranberry juice. I guess I like bitter stuff.
00:01:53 Bitter is best.
00:01:54 To a restaurant for breakfast, I would say, excuse me waiter, please give me a,
00:01:59 please mix me a tall glass of two-thirds cranberry, one-third grapefruit juice.
00:02:05 Thank you very much. And that is my favorite.
00:02:08 Did you say bitter? Do you mean bitter or do you mean like sour?
00:02:12 Bitter. I guess it's sour.
00:02:13 Cranberries, I mean they're a little sour, but cranberries and grapefruits are both bitter.
00:02:17 That's a terrible taste, but okay.
00:02:19 No, it's good shit.
00:02:20 No, it's good shit, dog.
00:02:22 I've at the grocery store, and I buy orange juice now,
00:02:25 that I do not also buy a carton of grapefruit juice to make this exact concoction,
00:02:30 because it is transcendent.
00:02:32 Bitter is only worse than sour.
00:02:36 No, wait, yeah, sour is only better than the bitter.
00:02:38 Sour and bitter are two worse.
00:02:40 It's just a brainlet take to be like, ooh, some of these quadrants of food are bad,
00:02:44 just across the board.
00:02:45 Certain categories of flavor are just out of the question.
00:02:49 Exactly, they're banned.
00:02:51 Do you not like coffee?
00:02:54 Unless I put a lot of sugar and cream into it.
00:02:57 No, I don't.
00:02:59 Yeah, okay.
00:03:00 I mean same, I also cream and sugar.
00:03:03 Well, I splenda, but same difference.
00:03:05 I also cream and sweeten my shit out of my coffee.
00:03:08 I do like lattes, like caramel.
00:03:11 I've been drinking black milk straight for the last while.
00:03:14 The fuck is black milk?
00:03:16 Did I say I meant black coffee?
00:03:19 Only the blackest of milk for me.
00:03:23 That would definitely scare me to see my milk turn black.
00:03:29 Hey, speaking, we started this discussion with apple juice.
00:03:32 Do you guys ever confuse apple juice with piss,
00:03:35 as is discussed famously in Homestuck?
00:03:38 No.
00:03:39 Unless someone in your house pisses in cartons or bottles.
00:03:44 Well, of course, I've told you that in college,
00:03:46 I discovered that my roommate was storing piss bottles
00:03:48 in the bottom of the trash can.
00:03:50 There was a period of my life where,
00:03:54 due to stressful living conditions,
00:03:56 I did pee in bottles so as to not leave my room
00:04:01 to go to the bathroom because I would have to see
00:04:04 the people I lived with.
00:04:06 And after the cabin fever started to set in,
00:04:08 it was looking pretty delicious.
00:04:10 What, mage?
00:04:12 You guys and your milk proved being able to pee in bottles.
00:04:16 I don't, that's true.
00:04:17 You would just need a funnel, you know?
00:04:19 Just you need additional tools all.
00:04:21 No, I was joking.
00:04:23 Well, I don't condone what I did,
00:04:26 but I don't condone it, but I...
00:04:30 I won't apologize for what I've done.
00:04:32 I feel like I was really...
00:04:34 I was really, it was a rock and a hard place.
00:04:37 I only did it because of the high pressure situation I was in.
00:04:41 It's okay. You were a Hickamore.
00:04:43 You couldn't go outside.
00:04:45 It's not that.
00:04:46 It was that I was under threat of being
00:04:50 evicted from my apartment every single day.
00:04:54 And also, one of the guys I was living with
00:04:56 was this intolerable unmedicated bipolar
00:05:01 who was just...
00:05:03 Every time you saw him, he would...
00:05:05 50% of the time...
00:05:06 There was a 50% chance that he would demand
00:05:09 that you do some things with him,
00:05:11 some completely pointless, time-consuming tasks,
00:05:15 like moving all the furniture from one side of the room
00:05:17 to the other side.
00:05:18 He was like, we gotta do this right now.
00:05:20 Come on.
00:05:21 And he would expect you to help him with it.
00:05:23 And I would just crouch in my room like,
00:05:25 God, I can't...
00:05:26 I can't risk it.
00:05:28 I can't do it.
00:05:30 Not again.
00:05:31 Okay, okay.
00:05:32 Does that have...
00:05:33 Is that related to the whole evicting thing?
00:05:35 Because it doesn't seem like it's your landlord
00:05:37 like cruising around.
00:05:38 No, no, no.
00:05:40 That was not specifically related.
00:05:42 Well, because of the eviction,
00:05:44 the possible eviction,
00:05:46 most people had left the house,
00:05:48 so it was just me, that guy, and one other guy.
00:05:51 Okay.
00:05:53 But no.
00:05:55 No.
00:05:56 Fair enough.
00:05:57 All right.
00:05:58 Well, guys, I'm sure you've heard,
00:06:00 Homestuck 2 was announced.
00:06:02 No.
00:06:03 If it was.
00:06:04 If it was announced.
00:06:06 Homestuck 2.
00:06:07 Okay.
00:06:08 It says on the website, it's official,
00:06:10 and I believe it.
00:06:11 Well, Nate, thank you.
00:06:12 I think I do see that.
00:06:13 Here's my question.
00:06:14 Do you give a shit?
00:06:16 Absolutely not.
00:06:18 Absolutely not.
00:06:19 All right, cool.
00:06:20 It's all there is to say.
00:06:22 I never really got into Homestuck,
00:06:24 so no, don't care.
00:06:25 I'm simply curious.
00:06:26 I'm simply curious.
00:06:27 I'd be curious to see if anyone disagrees
00:06:29 with me in the comments.
00:06:30 I read all Homestuck, you know,
00:06:32 was on the arm retrieval.
00:06:33 Good times, good times.
00:06:35 The epilogue came out.
00:06:37 Tried to read it.
00:06:38 Really tried.
00:06:39 It just felt to me like they were trying to...
00:06:43 It was like they deliberately didn't write
00:06:46 the full ending to Homestuck in Homestuck,
00:06:49 and now they're adding it back.
00:06:50 Like there are pieces just left out,
00:06:52 presumably to be filled in later,
00:06:54 as like this continuation or whatever.
00:06:56 I never mustered the energy to read the epilogue.
00:06:59 Do you just remember, just quickly,
00:07:01 there was that whole thing about like,
00:07:03 the Homestuck, the Fort Quadrant,
00:07:05 like the secret weapon that was used
00:07:07 against Cal at the very end.
00:07:09 We didn't really understand what it was
00:07:11 or how exactly it was found
00:07:13 or what the purpose of it was.
00:07:15 These things are somewhat explained in the epilogue.
00:07:17 I got to the point where at least that
00:07:19 made some sense, but then it just kept going
00:07:21 and I got completely bored, didn't finish it.
00:07:23 There was so much fucking text.
00:07:25 I don't have time for this shit.
00:07:27 I presume that it ended,
00:07:29 and I'm just flummoxed that there's Homestuck too.
00:07:31 I'm drinking a fucking blue Raz Rockstar X-Durance.
00:07:35 You know it's not even by Homestuck too.
00:07:37 I don't understand.
00:07:39 I'm just absolutely boggled that it's...
00:07:41 Wait, what?
00:07:43 I saw page one, it's got Dirk.
00:07:45 He's like a space pirate now.
00:07:47 Hussie is like the creative director of it.
00:07:49 Or this is what I heard.
00:07:51 It's like he doesn't...
00:07:53 He's like the Lauren Faust of it?
00:07:55 Yes.
00:07:57 You know, Lauren Faust had to approve every script.
00:07:59 She had to approve everything,
00:08:01 even if she didn't write every episode herself.
00:08:03 You know, I was happy to hear
00:08:05 what was that last episode,
00:08:07 that Hussie is engaging himself creatively
00:08:09 with his interesting fashion line
00:08:11 and is being a male Instagram model and whatnot.
00:08:13 It's not a fashion line.
00:08:15 He just dresses very cool and takes selfies.
00:08:17 That's totally sick,
00:08:19 and I totally support it.
00:08:21 It's kind of sick, yeah.
00:08:23 But frankly, compared to Homestuck too...
00:08:25 I don't give a shit about Homestuck too.
00:08:27 That is the most interesting creative thing
00:08:29 Hussie's done in a long time for me.
00:08:31 Yeah, I'm genuinely more interested
00:08:33 in Hussie being funny on Instagram
00:08:35 than I am in Homestuck too.
00:08:37 Although, didn't he help work on
00:08:39 Drill or Wint on Twitter?
00:08:41 He helped work on the book
00:08:43 that he made, that Gib bought.
00:08:45 I meant to buy as well.
00:08:47 Did Hussie help work on the sweet bro and hella Jeff book?
00:08:49 Yeah, he did.
00:08:51 Oh, I forgot it was a sweet bro and hella Jeff.
00:08:53 Whatever, you don't know what I'm saying.
00:08:55 Yeah, that's fine.
00:08:57 I haven't read it,
00:08:59 but if I ever got the chance,
00:09:01 I would thumb through it.
00:09:03 I've told you guys before
00:09:05 that my first ever exposure
00:09:07 before you told me about Homestuck was
00:09:09 just reading the sweet bro and hella Jeff comics
00:09:11 that we found online.
00:09:13 I should have stopped right there.
00:09:15 I had heard of sweet bro and hella Jeff
00:09:17 way before I ever heard of Homestuck.
00:09:19 Amazing.
00:09:21 Or at least I remember
00:09:23 reading Homestuck
00:09:25 they make reference
00:09:27 to sweet bro and hella Jeff and I'm like
00:09:29 wait, sweet bro and hella Jeff,
00:09:31 I've heard of that and then I go and find it
00:09:33 and I'm like, oh, sweet bro and hella Jeff
00:09:35 that's a Homestuck thing?
00:09:37 Like what?
00:09:39 I only knew about them as some sort of meme.
00:09:41 I still don't know their context.
00:09:43 I just know they exist and they're funny.
00:09:45 You should go to sweetbroandhellajeff.com
00:09:47 right fucking now.
00:09:49 But maybe I shouldn't.
00:09:51 They're fucking good.
00:09:53 They're legendary.
00:09:55 They taper off as they go.
00:09:57 Okay, they kinda taper off.
00:09:59 But the first half of it is fucking great.
00:10:01 I mean, they're legendary, they're great memes.
00:10:03 That's all there is to it.
00:10:05 Heavily inspirational to Gib.
00:10:07 Well, okay, he's not in this episode, but he's not.
00:10:09 Well, yeah.
00:10:11 Heavily inspirational to our country.
00:10:13 You're not wrong.
00:10:15 You're not wrong.
00:10:17 I had to quote Hussie, build that wall.
00:10:19 He really took his shit advice.
00:10:21 All right, there you go. Homestuck 2 done.
00:10:23 It's in the dirt.
00:10:25 Nothing else need to be said about that.
00:10:27 I opened up homestuck2.com or whatever
00:10:29 and I saw like, oh, Dirk on a spaceship
00:10:31 and I said, okay, and I hit that X
00:10:33 and I never looked back.
00:10:35 That's the way to do it.
00:10:37 If anyone has read it and it's good, just let me know.
00:10:39 I'd be shocked.
00:10:41 I'm very curious.
00:10:43 I wanna talk about an anime.
00:10:45 A single anime.
00:10:47 You have to listen.
00:10:49 Strap self into torture chamber.
00:10:51 I guess there's no law against it,
00:10:53 so I can't stop you.
00:10:55 It's called Ascendus of a Bookworm
00:10:57 and it's honestly one of the most pleasing
00:10:59 enemies of the season.
00:11:01 Or just like this year for me.
00:11:03 For me personally, it scratches
00:11:05 a certain itch.
00:11:07 It's like, I'm guessing you guys
00:11:09 at least watch Doctor Stone or Heard of It, right?
00:11:11 Of course.
00:11:13 I've read the first chapter of it.
00:11:15 He uses power of knowledge
00:11:17 to bring
00:11:19 science stuff
00:11:21 to the stone age,
00:11:23 so to speak, of the future.
00:11:25 Well, Ascendus of a Bookworm is sort of
00:11:27 a bit of an eseper. The stone age of the future.
00:11:29 I'm slightly confused, but okay.
00:11:33 That would be like a post...
00:11:35 What's the word? Post-apocalyptic.
00:11:37 What's the word that Preston Jacobs
00:11:39 uses to describe a period
00:11:41 of history wherein a society has regressed
00:11:43 from an advanced civilization to like a pre-space
00:11:45 or a per...
00:11:47 Oh, darn it!
00:11:49 Post-apocalyptic.
00:11:51 15 minutes from now, I'm going to shout out the word.
00:11:53 Okay, alright.
00:11:55 But yeah, Ascendus of a Bookworm is
00:11:57 a bit of an isekai, so like a girl
00:11:59 she...
00:12:01 Interregnum!
00:12:03 Interregnum.
00:12:05 That wasn't 15 minutes, but...
00:12:07 A period of time
00:12:09 after a society has achieved
00:12:11 spaceflight wherein they
00:12:13 lose it and enter a sort of like
00:12:15 intermediate dark age before we're
00:12:17 gaining it again. Does that happen specifically
00:12:19 spaceflight?
00:12:21 Well, I think maybe
00:12:23 in the context, George R.R. Martin used it,
00:12:25 whatever.
00:12:27 Ascendus of a Bookworm. Yes, like on Topic People.
00:12:29 I'm interrupting.
00:12:31 So, a girl dies and she gets
00:12:33 sort of reincarnated into a body
00:12:35 of like a five-year-old child
00:12:37 that actually just passed away
00:12:39 and she gets to inhabit her body
00:12:41 instead. It's really sad
00:12:43 and messed up when you think about it,
00:12:45 but they don't think about it and maybe
00:12:47 they don't address it.
00:12:49 But yeah, so she gets reincarnated
00:12:51 and she's like
00:12:53 all she wants to do is read a
00:12:55 book. She wants to read books,
00:12:57 but she lives
00:12:59 in a peasant household.
00:13:01 None of them can read or write
00:13:03 except for the father just barely.
00:13:05 He's a town guardsman, so he kind of has to.
00:13:07 But like no one knows what a book is.
00:13:09 So, her whole struggle
00:13:11 is her trying to find
00:13:13 or make a book
00:13:15 to read. Her comps, if you will.
00:13:17 Her struggle.
00:13:19 Fine.
00:13:21 Is to find and read a book or to
00:13:23 make a book herself if
00:13:25 their family cannot afford a book. Yeah, and she'll call it
00:13:27 and she'll call it my struggle
00:13:29 and she'll title it in her native German.
00:13:31 That's what I'm saying. No.
00:13:33 Continue. Can't fix that by the way, Ben.
00:13:35 Not struggle.
00:13:37 Wait, what?
00:13:39 I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure
00:13:41 Kampf is battle, not struggle.
00:13:43 I've heard people say
00:13:45 that it means my struggle.
00:13:47 I could be wrong. It's been
00:13:49 like two decades since I had
00:13:51 German class.
00:13:53 Two decades, I'd say. A decade.
00:13:55 I'm not that old.
00:13:57 Anyway, what's really
00:13:59 satisfying for me is you get to see
00:14:01 how much she
00:14:03 works towards such a simple
00:14:05 goal and like all the little
00:14:07 victories she has are just so satisfying
00:14:09 and she has so many
00:14:11 troubles doing it and she fails
00:14:13 along the way, but also she brings a little
00:14:15 bit of knowledge from her own world
00:14:17 into this
00:14:19 medieval sort of stylish word like
00:14:21 medieval styled world
00:14:23 like she sort of
00:14:25 like invents shampoo in
00:14:27 that world because she needs to be able to
00:14:29 shampoo. Yeah, she creates shampoo
00:14:31 like a very basic sort of shampoo.
00:14:33 She had seen fight clubs and she knows how to make soap
00:14:35 I assume. No, not so.
00:14:37 Does she like make a lie out of ashes?
00:14:39 Uh,
00:14:41 No? Or explain.
00:14:43 Can you tell me how does she make shampoo?
00:14:45 I'm genuinely curious. Now, if I remember
00:14:47 correctly, like she used some
00:14:49 oils from a fruit
00:14:51 and then she added some
00:14:55 What was it? What's it called?
00:14:57 Not vegetables, not mint.
00:14:59 What's that called?
00:15:01 Uh, it's like some grass things.
00:15:03 Some bullshit in there.
00:15:05 Shut up.
00:15:07 I forgot the name. I forgot the word.
00:15:09 Herbs, there we go. Some herbs into that oil.
00:15:11 Okay. Herbs and oils
00:15:13 are not what shampoo is made of.
00:15:15 Well, she's unacceptable.
00:15:17 No, it's some sort of like basic type
00:15:19 of shampoo she used to make with her mother
00:15:21 back in her own world.
00:15:23 And it worked
00:15:25 fine enough in a world where there's absolutely
00:15:27 no shampoo.
00:15:29 Is this as detailed as like Dr. Stone
00:15:31 which is seemingly pretty scientifically accurate?
00:15:33 I think so.
00:15:35 You should play Dwarf Fortress
00:15:37 where you have to have your dwarves
00:15:39 make their own shampoo.
00:15:41 You have to like burn wood
00:15:43 to make charcoal and then soak the charcoal
00:15:45 to make lye and then process the lye
00:15:47 into bars of soap and then mix
00:15:49 and then put it in a waterfall
00:15:51 and wash your dwarves. That sounds so boring, Ben.
00:15:53 How could that possibly be fun?
00:15:55 Yeah. You say it's boring
00:15:57 but then you build your communal
00:15:59 showers and then like
00:16:01 50 dwarves a year end up like
00:16:03 getting sucked down the drains and dying in the
00:16:05 cisterns beneath. Choked with
00:16:07 dwarf bodies of women and children
00:16:09 like legendary swords and axes
00:16:11 and pieces of armor down there just waiting
00:16:13 for some enterprising individual. You call
00:16:15 that boring, huh? It's just hard for me to understand
00:16:17 how this could not be boring.
00:16:19 The fucking death bath house.
00:16:21 Okay, but back to the anime.
00:16:23 It is similar to Dr. Stone
00:16:25 in the fact that like, you know,
00:16:27 she explains all these things
00:16:29 and how she's making it and stuff.
00:16:31 But Dr. Stone has a lot of energy
00:16:33 and lots of
00:16:35 extreme facial expressions and stuff like that
00:16:37 and with this one it's
00:16:39 a lot more like slow
00:16:41 and tone down but it's also
00:16:43 like cute and it's still interested.
00:16:45 I'm surprised how interested I am.
00:16:47 I'm just loving the crap out of this anime
00:16:49 and I just want to see more. It's just
00:16:51 as much as that I didn't know I had
00:16:53 and it's great. I love it.
00:16:55 Fair enough. So I recommend people
00:16:57 to watch it. Okay.
00:16:59 I think I can understand the appeal.
00:17:01 It's like with most isekais
00:17:03 it's usually a power fantasy.
00:17:05 You sort of like you solve all your
00:17:07 problems with magic.
00:17:09 You're a super powered guy. You're the
00:17:11 only one. You're the chosen one.
00:17:13 You're the god of this universe. But with this
00:17:15 she's a five almost six
00:17:17 year old girl and she's so weak
00:17:19 physically that she can't even walk to
00:17:21 the edge of the
00:17:23 town. To the shitter. So she's constantly
00:17:25 shitting herself. No.
00:17:27 Acceptable.
00:17:29 It takes three months
00:17:31 of her to build up
00:17:33 her stamina just so she can
00:17:35 reach the edge of town.
00:17:37 That's how weak she is.
00:17:39 With that frail body
00:17:41 and her getting constantly
00:17:43 like fevers and stuff.
00:17:45 She's working towards
00:17:47 accomplishing her goal of just making a
00:17:49 book. So what is her goal?
00:17:51 To make a book.
00:17:53 Yes.
00:17:55 Why doesn't she just make a book?
00:17:57 It's hard. What's
00:17:59 standing in her way?
00:18:01 She has no access to
00:18:03 paper.
00:18:05 She starts off not knowing
00:18:07 the language of the land. She has to
00:18:09 learn to read and write and stuff.
00:18:11 Wait.
00:18:13 She has to
00:18:15 learn to read and write the language.
00:18:17 Then she has to get
00:18:19 trees and process them into paper on her
00:18:21 own. Probably
00:18:23 skin a cow and tan the
00:18:25 leather to make the binding or something.
00:18:27 I just may be at some point
00:18:29 but no. She tried to make papyrus
00:18:31 which didn't work. Then she tried to do
00:18:33 clay tablets which is
00:18:35 the last art we just did.
00:18:37 I appreciate
00:18:39 how ridiculously specific this premise is.
00:18:41 You said she was a...
00:18:43 If she liked books at all, she must
00:18:45 have been able to read in her original world.
00:18:47 She already
00:18:49 can speak that language and obviously
00:18:51 she didn't have to learn how to speak.
00:18:53 Is there some isekai thing
00:18:55 where she speaks the same language
00:18:57 she used to speak? Maybe
00:18:59 this world is different.
00:19:01 If I remember correctly, I think
00:19:03 when she first got isekai, she didn't understand.
00:19:05 I'm not too certain because I watch
00:19:07 so many enemies. I'm like how it's a verb
00:19:09 to get isekai'd.
00:19:11 It's a thing.
00:19:13 It's a thing now sadly.
00:19:15 My favorite thing about isekai's
00:19:17 my absolute number one favorite thing
00:19:19 is all these stories about
00:19:21 how you put
00:19:23 an average neat loser
00:19:25 with no skills, no abilities
00:19:27 into a world and they don't get anything.
00:19:29 I particularly like the power fantasy
00:19:31 of these gamer
00:19:33 skills I had as a worthless piece
00:19:35 or should gamer who achieved nothing in my life
00:19:37 I can now pretend, I like the fantasy
00:19:39 of pretending that those skills might have
00:19:41 some use in some other world
00:19:43 even though we all know they never would
00:19:45 and they never will. It's embarrassing
00:19:47 when they try. With her, she used to read a lot
00:19:49 of books so she's applying the knowledge from
00:19:51 the books. Well, that's fine. That's not
00:19:53 what I'm talking about. That's a-okay.
00:19:55 The only good isekai
00:19:57 that has ever been written
00:19:59 and ever will be written
00:20:01 is slime and punishment.
00:20:03 The story of phantom horn being
00:20:05 sent from his cozy, boring
00:20:07 existence in the real world
00:20:09 of Ponyville into the
00:20:11 fantastical wonderland that is
00:20:13 New Los Angeles City.
00:20:15 I'm not surprised. The greatest
00:20:17 isekai ever made
00:20:19 currently in its fifth season.
00:20:21 Six seasons in a movie, baby.
00:20:23 They just had a curiosity.
00:20:25 It seems like you're plugging
00:20:27 along towards the end. Is that close to ending now?
00:20:29 Are you getting close to the end? Well,
00:20:31 the main
00:20:33 story that I set out to write
00:20:35 is over. I did successfully
00:20:37 tell the story of their- But it's time
00:20:39 for slime and punishment, too, baby!
00:20:41 It's time to cash in! It's basically
00:20:43 time to go from the
00:20:45 story I set out to tell, and now I have
00:20:47 now- I mean, because Chris made
00:20:49 some- Oh! You know what I have
00:20:51 here? And this ties into what I'm talking
00:20:53 about. Uh, fuck. Where are they?
00:20:55 Where are they? Where are they? Where do I put them?
00:20:57 Uh...
00:20:59 Damn! Wait. No, no, no.
00:21:01 No, no, no.
00:21:03 Okay, well, I can't find them. Whatever.
00:21:05 The point is, Chris sent me
00:21:07 her, um,
00:21:09 custom-made cards
00:21:11 for Twilight Sparkle's secret
00:21:13 shipfic folder.
00:21:15 Uh, when they have- She sent me
00:21:17 the Arizona Slime
00:21:19 expansion pack. Did you
00:21:21 have to give Chris your address in order to achieve
00:21:23 this? Yes. Oh, okay.
00:21:25 Whatever. Chris is not protective of
00:21:27 personal information. Who gives a shit?
00:21:29 Fair enough. Fair enough. What's she gonna do?
00:21:31 Well, I just mean she might leak it
00:21:33 because she's a bit of a dunce at these things.
00:21:35 Yeah, because you're s- Why- Why?
00:21:37 Why would she do that? Well, I'm not saying
00:21:39 intentionally, but she's so flipping with
00:21:41 her own personal information. That's true.
00:21:43 Okay, whatever. Doesn't matter. Not important.
00:21:45 It's totally unimportant.
00:21:47 Frankly, I'm a fender that you even brought it up.
00:21:49 Indeed you are. Um, anyway,
00:21:51 uh, yeah, I fucking-
00:21:53 I'm holding them- I was holding them in my
00:21:55 hands. Um, I don't know why-
00:21:57 where- I- they- I-
00:21:59 Okay, I'm just gonna stop freaking out.
00:22:01 Oh, I used them as toilet paper because I was
00:22:03 running out. Oh, darn. Aw, shit.
00:22:05 Aw, not again.
00:22:07 Second time this week.
00:22:09 Uh, where the fuck would
00:22:11 they be? Where the fuck would they be?
00:22:13 Look, I'm with you, but do you need them
00:22:15 to make your current point, uh, at this jun-
00:22:17 I was gonna read off some of the text on them because they're really funny.
00:22:19 Oh, yeah. Okay. There's one- Okay.
00:22:21 She posted, like, screencaps of
00:22:23 all of them, uh, on Twitter,
00:22:25 but there's one in there
00:22:27 that is not that she never posted,
00:22:29 and I think it was, like, meant to be a secret.
00:22:31 Or maybe, I don't know. But it seems
00:22:33 like it's, like, directly addressed
00:22:35 to me. And it's basically Chris
00:22:37 Chance on it, too, wagging her fucking finger
00:22:39 out of the card, directly at the viewer,
00:22:41 being, like, be nice
00:22:43 to your OCs. Don't fuck
00:22:45 with your OCs. It's cruel
00:22:47 to be- to write bad things happening
00:22:49 to your OCs. Um, what- Chris wrote murder of his
00:22:51 OCs. They were horribly- Chris literally murdered
00:22:53 70,000 people in
00:22:55 New Los Angeles City. Oh, shit.
00:22:57 But those were the OCs, so it's okay.
00:22:59 Literal genocide.
00:23:01 Uh, hey, we can pause for a moment.
00:23:03 You can go look if you want. We can just cut that out.
00:23:05 Do you want to?
00:23:07 Well, oh, I see him.
00:23:09 Hey, alright, there you go. See?
00:23:11 Although, I mean, to be honest, I feel like I've already
00:23:13 explained everything I needed
00:23:15 to about him. Um, well,
00:23:17 yeah, do you want to just get the exact text
00:23:19 of that? I'm curious to hear it.
00:23:21 I want to hear it in Chris' own words. Sure.
00:23:23 Uh, where is it? Where is it? There's Chris Hold- Chris
00:23:25 Chance Ones, you're holding the Slime Podron,
00:23:27 uh, the- the
00:23:29 bicarbonate rain. Here we go. You got to give us
00:23:31 some pictures of this for the show notes, please.
00:23:33 Sure. The- the card is called,
00:23:35 and this is blasphemy,
00:23:37 uh, an endless war-free state.
00:23:39 So just like all the politicians of our
00:23:41 day, they're all calling for an end to endless war.
00:23:43 Bastards. Have they no shame?
00:23:45 Uh, so this is a goal card.
00:23:47 Do you- do you guys have any idea
00:23:49 how Twilight Sparkle's secret chip folder works,
00:23:51 by the way, because I don't? No. No, none.
00:23:53 This is- it's- well, I'll- I'll talk about it in a second.
00:23:55 I saw that there was a Magic the Gathering
00:23:57 crossover with MLP the other day. Now that,
00:23:59 I understand. Wait, like an official one?
00:24:01 Yeah, like actual magic cards
00:24:03 with like rarity the rare.
00:24:05 She's like a 2-2 monster unicorn
00:24:07 legendary. No, come on.
00:24:09 Celestia or something. Yeah. Yeah.
00:24:11 No. That's just real.
00:24:13 You're lying. I'll find a picture.
00:24:15 Stop lying to me. I'll find it.
00:24:17 All right. Well, um,
00:24:19 oh my god, IGN Magic the Gathering
00:24:21 reveals my little pony crossover set.
00:24:23 This is vile. This is truly vile.
00:24:25 There you go. All right, goal card.
00:24:27 An endless war-free state.
00:24:29 Win this goal when
00:24:31 at least three pony cards
00:24:33 who have been given the villain keyword
00:24:35 by card effects are either cleared
00:24:37 of the villain keyword or discarded
00:24:39 in the same turn.
00:24:41 Uh, and then there's a
00:24:43 parentheses 13,
00:24:45 and I don't know where the 13 comes in.
00:24:47 Quote,
00:24:49 and so the slime co-dilemma
00:24:51 and the endless war came to a close
00:24:53 in Dimension C197
00:24:55 on October 3rd,
00:24:57 2019.
00:24:59 When the moral being even the heavi-
00:25:01 No, sorry. The moral being
00:25:03 even the heaviest of hatred can be quelled
00:25:05 when we come together towards a common goal.
00:25:07 Also,
00:25:09 your OCs should be treated with kindness and respect.
00:25:11 Do not abuse them
00:25:13 or each other.
00:25:15 It's on a chew.
00:25:17 So, I got these in the mail
00:25:19 and I thought, damn,
00:25:21 this makes me want to get the game
00:25:23 and like play the game with these
00:25:25 cards in it.
00:25:27 Sure.
00:25:29 I don't know. I think Twilight Sparkle's secret ship
00:25:31 of photos seems like a kind of funny game,
00:25:33 I guess. I wasn't that interested.
00:25:35 But with these, maybe I'm a little interested.
00:25:37 But I went to go buy it
00:25:39 and it turns out you can't.
00:25:41 Literally,
00:25:43 the company is just out of business.
00:25:45 But you can kind of do it
00:25:47 and like the way that
00:25:49 okay, you can still get the game
00:25:51 but
00:25:53 you have to do it in the same way that Chris
00:25:55 made these cards which is if you go
00:25:57 to the Twilight Sparkle
00:25:59 official site
00:26:01 they'll be like, hey guys, we're out of business
00:26:03 but you can still
00:26:05 make the game the same way we did and they just redirect
00:26:07 you to like a custom card printing
00:26:09 site and they're like, here's the files
00:26:11 just give them the files
00:26:13 and like you can like have them make your own
00:26:15 set.
00:26:17 That's pretty cool, I guess. It's kind of cool.
00:26:19 It's kind of weird.
00:26:21 Don't you think that's fucking weird? I think it's bizarre.
00:26:23 It seems like they're like, even though our game
00:26:25 is technically dead, like we still
00:26:27 and we can't sustain it anymore. We just want people
00:26:29 to be able to keep playing if they really want to.
00:26:31 So here you go, folks. Here's the fucking
00:26:33 Yeah, I mean, I guess so.
00:26:35 Personally, I don't understand why they would
00:26:37 like do that.
00:26:39 Like, why declare yourself
00:26:41 generous.
00:26:43 Yeah, but why declare yourself out of business
00:26:45 when you could just be like, every time
00:26:47 you tell someone go make it yourself
00:26:49 you could just take
00:26:51 an order for it and do it for them
00:26:53 and like probably make a profit off of it.
00:26:55 Maybe they are planning
00:26:57 a resurgence one day. They had, like everyone
00:26:59 was busy. They had to go make their bread
00:27:01 elsewhere but they're hoping to come back
00:27:03 one day and they want to just seed the
00:27:05 world with as many of these as possible in
00:27:07 the meantime to spark
00:27:09 interest. I don't know.
00:27:11 I guess. Yeah, I mean,
00:27:13 maybe. I don't know. It's
00:27:15 weird. But
00:27:17 alright, I just want to say
00:27:19 that, okay, these
00:27:21 cards explain
00:27:23 these cards explain that
00:27:25 the bicarbonate
00:27:27 rainstorm did de-slime New
00:27:29 Los Angeles City
00:27:31 and put an end to the Endless War
00:27:33 and that is true, however
00:27:35 only in the alpha
00:27:37 timeline and there are
00:27:39 beta timelines. They are doomed beta timelines
00:27:41 like in Homestuck but they do
00:27:43 exist and they shouldn't be
00:27:45 written off as irrelevant.
00:27:47 Well, geez, you're really seeding
00:27:49 a lot of ground here. What makes this timeline
00:27:51 the alpha timeline? What's to say that one isn't
00:27:53 doomed? Why is that one so
00:27:55 legit? What are you talking
00:27:57 about? The alpha timeline is
00:27:59 the alpha timeline and the others are offshoot beta timelines
00:28:01 and beta timelines die.
00:28:03 But how can you determine
00:28:05 between a beta and an alpha timeline
00:28:07 at any given time?
00:28:09 I don't know.
00:28:11 Noby's got all kinds of freaky
00:28:13 dimension eyes and he can see weird shit
00:28:15 and he knows these things. I don't know.
00:28:17 Look, I don't know. I can see
00:28:19 into C197. I'm just reporting
00:28:21 what's going on there, okay? I'm not
00:28:23 the scientist, right?
00:28:25 I'm not the expert. I only report.
00:28:27 Well, you know,
00:28:29 on this subject, there was one other thing
00:28:31 that we wanted to discuss last week or that
00:28:33 I was going to bring up. We just forgot
00:28:35 or whatever. And it was that like, or rather
00:28:37 I was going to bring up more. I think we talked
00:28:39 about it a little bit. It was that when you
00:28:41 finished your Kickstarter, you got your
00:28:43 Yang 12K
00:28:45 yearly earnings. Yeah, 12K got my UBI.
00:28:47 My own personal UBI.
00:28:49 Upon seeing that, Chris just wanted
00:28:51 that money despite it being
00:28:53 specifically for a business venture
00:28:55 and it's just this
00:28:57 perception of Ben now has
00:28:59 that money. He could give that money
00:29:01 to me now. To be fair,
00:29:03 he could do that. He could. To be fair,
00:29:05 neither Chris nor MagiChan
00:29:07 has
00:29:09 mentioned that to me in a while now.
00:29:11 So they might have dropped it. I'm not
00:29:13 sure. Although
00:29:15 who knows? Like, they could come back
00:29:17 at me at any time.
00:29:19 It was mostly MagiChan.
00:29:21 They were
00:29:23 absolutely good cop, bad cop in me.
00:29:25 MagiChan was like the hard
00:29:27 ass, like, you better
00:29:29 pay what you owe criminal
00:29:31 scum. And Chris
00:29:33 acted as though that wasn't happening.
00:29:35 I can't hold him back that long, Ben.
00:29:37 Yeah, like, hey, listen,
00:29:39 I'm not responsible for anything my partner
00:29:41 does, okay?
00:29:43 And if you
00:29:45 really make him mad, he'll get Mewtwo on
00:29:47 your ass and you definitely don't want that.
00:29:49 That's gonna be way worse for you.
00:29:51 You think MagiChan's mean?
00:29:53 He learned everything he knows about
00:29:55 being mean from Mewtwo, okay?
00:29:57 True.
00:29:59 So, um, hopefully we don't have to
00:30:01 take it to that level.
00:30:03 I think there's something to be learned
00:30:05 about the nature of man in this little
00:30:07 exchange here. When money is there,
00:30:09 it just, everybody just wants it.
00:30:11 If you want to want it.
00:30:13 Yeah, well, um, too bad.
00:30:15 Suckers.
00:30:17 Yeah, go make your own Kickstarter, folks.
00:30:19 I guess that's all there is to it.
00:30:21 Oh, um, actually, MagiChan
00:30:23 asked me, it's funny,
00:30:25 he asked me like, he said
00:30:27 like, hey, you know,
00:30:29 you don't have to pay me that 300 bucks
00:30:31 if you will make a Kickstarter
00:30:33 for my,
00:30:35 did I already talk about this?
00:30:37 I think you mentioned it, I believe it.
00:30:39 If you make a Kickstarter with a goal of
00:30:41 $5,000, I'll waive that
00:30:43 $300 you quote-unquote owe me
00:30:45 if you run my campaign for me.
00:30:47 That's very silly.
00:30:49 I did not listen last week's episode.
00:30:51 Why are you quote-unquote
00:30:53 owing money to them?
00:30:55 I mean,
00:30:57 good question.
00:30:59 That's a great question.
00:31:01 Okay, it's a little unclear
00:31:03 of whether the reason is
00:31:05 because I
00:31:07 used Chris's
00:31:09 characters in the story
00:31:11 because I
00:31:13 used the comic
00:31:15 to attract attention
00:31:17 while running a Kickstarter
00:31:19 which made money,
00:31:21 maybe?
00:31:23 Or...
00:31:25 But the comic has nothing to do
00:31:27 with the Kickstarter, right?
00:31:29 True, well observed.
00:31:31 Or the other possible reason might be
00:31:33 because Chris used my characters
00:31:35 on her cards
00:31:37 and therefore I ought to pay
00:31:39 to have them made.
00:31:41 These are like three different reasons
00:31:43 that are sort of kind of interchangeably given.
00:31:45 The last one sounds like Chris should
00:31:47 be paying you
00:31:49 to use that.
00:31:51 So the Kickstarter had nothing
00:31:53 to do with the comic in which
00:31:55 you used Chris's...
00:31:57 Technically, the slime-oid stuff at the end
00:31:59 was related, I suppose.
00:32:01 Yeah, I mean...
00:32:03 I'm still angry
00:32:05 with you about that.
00:32:07 With me?
00:32:09 Well, it's okay because Tom and Hippo
00:32:11 both saved it.
00:32:13 Okay, good.
00:32:15 I haven't been on Twitter in a while, so...
00:32:17 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:32:19 No, it was great.
00:32:21 I'm so glad.
00:32:23 I don't regret anything because it worked out so good.
00:32:25 Yeah, Hippo drew Red Man
00:32:27 saving it at the last minute.
00:32:29 And then Tom made a full 3D animation
00:32:31 of Izumi saving it at the last minute.
00:32:33 Oh, that's nice.
00:32:35 Yeah, we gotta go look at it.
00:32:37 We talked about extensive the last time.
00:32:39 Yeah, we won't dwell on it because we talked about it last time,
00:32:41 but you should check it out. They're both really good.
00:32:43 I don't know if these are two separate timelines.
00:32:45 I kind of wonder if maybe...
00:32:47 because the Izumi thing happened,
00:32:49 I kind of wonder if maybe
00:32:51 they didn't just happen in order.
00:32:53 Like, maybe Izumi
00:32:55 saved it from the pit.
00:32:57 And then, because Hippo then drew
00:32:59 a page of N7
00:33:01 showing up to fight Izumi.
00:33:03 So I wonder if maybe just in the battle,
00:33:05 like,
00:33:07 Uwupadi just accidentally fell back
00:33:09 into the vet anyway.
00:33:11 Like, the two of them were too busy fighting,
00:33:13 so it took Red Man to come in.
00:33:15 Where did I go wrong?
00:33:17 I've hit walk bottom.
00:33:19 And maybe then just Red Man came in
00:33:21 and scooped it out. I don't know.
00:33:23 My hypothesis is that these are both the same timeline.
00:33:25 You keep seem to be implying
00:33:27 that that was Red Man who saved him.
00:33:29 That wasn't Red Man. That was Suzy,
00:33:31 the slime girl O.C. of Gib.
00:33:33 Was it?
00:33:35 Yeah, go look at it again.
00:33:37 It's clearly like a girl. It's not Red Man.
00:33:39 At least, I think.
00:33:41 You know, we talked about this too much last time.
00:33:43 Hold on, hold on. Now, this is interesting.
00:33:45 Because
00:33:47 it was a little pinkish, wasn't it?
00:33:49 Yes, of course.
00:33:51 Wait a minute. Okay.
00:33:53 Okay.
00:33:55 I gots to make sure.
00:33:57 Okay, cut all this out.
00:33:59 Cut all this out. Just all of it.
00:34:01 It's all bullshit. It's all bullshit.
00:34:03 All of the podcasts, like making 0 minutes,
00:34:05 0 seconds.
00:34:09 Alright.
00:34:11 See what I'm saying? Look at those hands.
00:34:13 Those pink hands.
00:34:15 Okay. You know?
00:34:17 You got a point?
00:34:19 I don't know.
00:34:21 Look at the top of its head.
00:34:23 It looks like a smooth circle to me.
00:34:25 I mean, that could just be a curve
00:34:27 at the top of Suzy's
00:34:29 like, I think her name is Suzy.
00:34:31 That could be fucking wrong.
00:34:33 Her hair, head thing.
00:34:35 No, okay.
00:34:37 Right, though. Well, Red Man was wearing a suit.
00:34:39 But still, still, I believe.
00:34:41 Yeah, I assumed it was Red Noir
00:34:43 suit
00:34:45 version, Red Man.
00:34:47 I see what you mean.
00:34:49 Like, the one thing that I think is
00:34:51 supports the Suzy hypothesis
00:34:53 is the color.
00:34:55 Because it does seem a little pinker
00:34:57 than I'm used to seeing Red Man.
00:34:59 But the top of the head
00:35:01 to me looks like Red Man's head.
00:35:03 Please edit it.
00:35:05 Look at the top of his head.
00:35:07 I mean, in this moment.
00:35:09 What is that?
00:35:11 Oh, you wouldn't know, Ben.
00:35:13 I don't, so I guess you're right.
00:35:17 Okay, well, viewers,
00:35:19 let us know in the comments
00:35:21 what do you think. Do you support
00:35:23 the Suzy hypothesis or the Red Man hypothesis?
00:35:25 I need, like, a list
00:35:27 of Hippo's characters
00:35:29 and just, like, put them
00:35:31 next to that. Either way,
00:35:33 Hippo has made, like, big, like,
00:35:35 collection images, like, all his male characters
00:35:37 and all his female characters.
00:35:39 Either way, I still support the unrelated
00:35:41 hypothesis that both Rescue,
00:35:43 both Tom's Rescue and Hippo's Rescue
00:35:45 took place in the same timeline,
00:35:47 just one immediately after the other.
00:35:49 Um, but...
00:35:51 There are now two slimes instead of one.
00:35:53 But I can't prove it.
00:35:55 But I can't prove it.
00:35:57 Well, because Chris said that if
00:35:59 Uwupati survived, it would be bad
00:36:01 for everyone. So I'm thinking that the one
00:36:03 in which Uwupati survived is the Beta timeline,
00:36:05 which the comic is now taking place in,
00:36:07 which has a frame and Nobi
00:36:09 are discussing the timelines, and they have
00:36:11 to come up with a plan to get back to the Alpha timeline
00:36:13 before the universe dissolves, right?
00:36:15 Because in the Alpha timeline,
00:36:17 all the slime was destroyed.
00:36:19 So they got to get back to the Alpha timeline,
00:36:21 but they got to do something about the slimes
00:36:23 because they don't want to go back and live in the Alpha timeline
00:36:25 if there's no slime. They got to find a way to bring
00:36:27 the slime with them. That's the plan.
00:36:29 What was this pink OC?
00:36:31 Huh?
00:36:33 What? What? What?
00:36:35 Look at the gross disgusting. Another show notes.
00:36:37 Oh, yeah, that's some...
00:36:39 Let's not go down this rabbit hole. Look at this image.
00:36:41 Now look at this image. Very cool image.
00:36:43 I'm not going down any rabbit hole.
00:36:45 I don't know what you're talking about.
00:36:47 I've never gone down a rabbit hole in my entire life.
00:36:49 Hey, Zenhuxible says he wants to join.
00:36:51 You want to just hop over to the other chat
00:36:53 and let him in?
00:36:55 Okay. I'm scared.
00:36:57 The answer is yes. Okay, hang on.
00:36:59 I've never been on the same podcast as a guest
00:37:01 as well, so I don't know. I'm scared.
00:37:03 Whatever?
00:37:05 I always purposely miss those episodes
00:37:07 so that the guest can have room to...
00:37:09 Purposely?
00:37:11 Well, we're low on people anyway, so...
00:37:13 I'm sick of you losers.
00:37:15 Let's get some fresh blood in here.
00:37:19 Done. How's it going, dog?
00:37:21 What's up? Hello.
00:37:23 I've been in a particularly
00:37:25 weird situation lately because
00:37:27 I work on weekends, right?
00:37:29 I'm in college right now. I'm in my senior year
00:37:31 working on my animation thesis.
00:37:33 It's been a lot of fun,
00:37:35 but the other problem is
00:37:37 I just haven't been having a lot of time
00:37:39 working on it because I've
00:37:41 been working on the weekends.
00:37:43 So I have two days free to work on it
00:37:45 and then I have class the other three days.
00:37:47 So what I'm thinking, because I've saved
00:37:49 a lot of money up because I also do commissions
00:37:51 and whatnot, so I'm thinking I'm just going to quit the job
00:37:53 because I want to...
00:37:55 This is what I'm going to be presenting to
00:37:57 my employers when I leave college.
00:37:59 So I want it to be the best thing
00:38:01 that showcases what I can do as an animator.
00:38:03 So I want to make the best product that I can.
00:38:05 I've got to leave the job.
00:38:07 I've got to come right back.
00:38:09 Fair enough.
00:38:11 This isn't really a dilemma that's in my mind.
00:38:13 It's just like, I'm explaining
00:38:15 where I am mentally right now.
00:38:17 I was actually supposed to go into work today
00:38:19 and I was like, you know what? No.
00:38:21 I'm not going to do that.
00:38:23 So did you just quit or something just now?
00:38:25 Yeah, I just quit.
00:38:27 All right, man. Deb.
00:38:29 Deb.
00:38:31 Truly we live in a post job society.
00:38:33 I have other money making
00:38:35 sources of commissions.
00:38:37 Exactly.
00:38:39 It's not like no liquid is coming in,
00:38:41 but you know,
00:38:43 that floor is coming under me.
00:38:45 Speaking of liquid,
00:38:47 are we hanging out on Halloween?
00:38:49 Oh, absolutely.
00:38:51 Nice.
00:38:53 It sounds like fun.
00:38:55 I saw Munchie and I was like, hey.
00:38:57 Maybe move to the real world for once in your life, Mage.
00:38:59 They tell me.
00:39:01 Munchie and Kazzy tell me
00:39:03 they've seen you once or twice around
00:39:05 and I'm like, damn.
00:39:07 I can't believe all these,
00:39:09 all my separate cinematic universes
00:39:11 are converging into one.
00:39:13 It's a really weird thing because the thing is,
00:39:15 I'm a real homebody.
00:39:17 So when I'm not at school,
00:39:19 I'm just animating.
00:39:21 Or watching Bojack Horseman,
00:39:23 which is what I was doing before I came in here.
00:39:25 Yeah,
00:39:27 the newest season came out yesterday.
00:39:29 Just in case you wanted to be extra set.
00:39:31 Right, exactly.
00:39:33 No, the new season came out yesterday.
00:39:35 I don't think
00:39:37 I ever was up to...
00:39:39 I think I watched the first season.
00:39:41 It was good though.
00:39:43 I think I watched four seasons.
00:39:45 Okay, so I missed one season
00:39:47 and I'm missing this one.
00:39:49 No, I just
00:39:51 I binge all my shows.
00:39:53 If you do the same.
00:39:55 Release the whole episode.
00:39:57 I did something a little shameful.
00:39:59 We were talking about
00:40:01 Twin Perfect last week.
00:40:03 Indeed.
00:40:05 They put out that four hour video about Twin Peace.
00:40:07 Oh my god, I forgot about that.
00:40:09 You gotta mention that.
00:40:11 I don't know if I'm even apologizing.
00:40:13 I feel like this is bad,
00:40:15 but I don't think I want to apologize for it.
00:40:17 I haven't seen the new Twin Peaks.
00:40:19 I watched the video.
00:40:21 I don't care that it spoiled everything.
00:40:23 Oh my god, this is a four hour video?
00:40:25 It's four and a half hours.
00:40:27 This is incredibly fortuitous.
00:40:29 Last episode I was bitching and fetching about
00:40:31 Where's Twin Perfect?
00:40:33 I brought up Twin Perfect.
00:40:35 Did you?
00:40:37 I think I brought up the song
00:40:39 for some reason.
00:40:41 I don't know, whatever.
00:40:43 It doesn't matter who brought it up.
00:40:45 I believe you, Ben.
00:40:47 I expressed some sentiment.
00:40:49 Where's Twin Perfect?
00:40:51 It's been so long.
00:40:53 It had been over a year since their last video.
00:40:55 They just released it.
00:40:57 I was like, what are they doing?
00:40:59 They're probably fucking around.
00:41:01 The biggest fucking video I've ever seen since that one.
00:41:03 Were we talking about cancel culture?
00:41:05 Or I think I wanted to talk about that thing
00:41:07 with Tom.
00:41:09 Tom Hewlett and the whole blaming him.
00:41:11 I'm sorry.
00:41:13 I'm still hung up on how you said Kovetching.
00:41:15 Is that like Northern European slang or something?
00:41:17 It's like Jewish.
00:41:19 I think that's Yiddish or something.
00:41:21 I probably got that from Seinfeld in my youth.
00:41:23 This is my estimation.
00:41:25 I've been watching some hot YouTube one piece.
00:41:27 I don't know why I said one piece.
00:41:29 Seinfeld's Kovetching.
00:41:31 It's basically the Seinfeld of Japan.
00:41:33 I don't know why I said one piece.
00:41:35 I don't know why I said one piece.
00:41:37 It's basically the Seinfeld of Japan.
00:41:39 Two and one piece.
00:41:41 True.
00:41:43 Lucy, stop eating all the meat.
00:41:47 Sanji, fuck you.
00:41:49 I just want to sleep in lift weights.
00:41:51 Boom, boom, boom, boom.
00:41:53 Stop just getting upset.
00:41:57 Okay, so Twin Perfect.
00:41:59 The biggest video I've ever seen in my fucking life.
00:42:01 It's so huge.
00:42:03 Ben watched it. Cool.
00:42:05 I recently watched Twin Peaks Season 1 and 2.
00:42:09 I was like, okay.
00:42:11 I did a big glowing tweet of this.
00:42:13 I can't believe these guys proved me so fucking stupid and wrong.
00:42:15 I got to go watch the new season
00:42:17 before I watch their video,
00:42:19 which I'm dying to do.
00:42:21 I got to Episode 6,
00:42:23 and it took too much brain power.
00:42:25 So I had to slow down and relax.
00:42:27 Here's the thing.
00:42:29 I didn't watch the new season.
00:42:31 A couple of years ago,
00:42:33 I did watch Twin Peaks, the original.
00:42:35 I liked it.
00:42:37 It was cool.
00:42:39 I'm a big fan.
00:42:41 You know, I know the new season's out.
00:42:43 I hadn't seen it.
00:42:45 I don't know when or if I was going to make time to see it.
00:42:47 But I did see the Twin Perfect
00:42:49 review or analysis was out.
00:42:51 And I was like, I really want to see that.
00:42:53 I want to see that more than I care.
00:42:55 More than I want to see the new season.
00:42:57 So I'm just going to watch it.
00:42:59 And you know what?
00:43:01 I really don't.
00:43:03 I guess I'm just one of these people that spoilers don't matter.
00:43:05 I don't feel like I'll get less out of it
00:43:07 if I ever do decide to watch the new Twin Peaks.
00:43:09 That weighed on me.
00:43:11 That particular question
00:43:13 weighed on me heavily.
00:43:15 The funny thing is,
00:43:17 I got into Twin Perfect from the start.
00:43:19 They're some of my favorite YouTubers with their shit.
00:43:21 The real Silent Hill experience, whatever.
00:43:23 I got into Silent Hill.
00:43:25 You showed them to me a long time ago.
00:43:27 Yeah, exactly.
00:43:29 Their videos were the exhaustive,
00:43:31 incredibly in-depth reviews
00:43:33 of every detail of every Silent Hill game.
00:43:35 Yeah, it spoiled everything.
00:43:37 But you know what I did then?
00:43:39 I went and I played the games and I fucking love them.
00:43:41 I don't give a shit about Silent Hill.
00:43:43 I have no desire to ever play a Silent Hill game.
00:43:45 But I love those Silent Hill reviews.
00:43:47 They are good.
00:43:49 So was this a good video?
00:43:51 Did you enjoy it?
00:43:53 Yes, I did.
00:43:55 It is very much...
00:43:57 Twin Perfect have this mindset.
00:43:59 Twin Perfect really believe
00:44:01 that they can solve media.
00:44:03 They can find the hidden,
00:44:05 the meaning of it.
00:44:07 Which is very annoying and objectively wrong.
00:44:09 But it's still a funny exercise
00:44:11 to watch some of the...
00:44:13 That is their approach, though.
00:44:15 It is a fun exercise to watch them go through.
00:44:17 And they make pretty good...
00:44:19 Not fungo,
00:44:21 he lays out a pretty compelling case
00:44:23 for his interpretation
00:44:25 of what it all means.
00:44:27 It's good stuff, man.
00:44:29 That is a funny approach.
00:44:31 I don't think I would ever...
00:44:33 I suppose if someone
00:44:35 proposes to me an interpretation of a show
00:44:37 I really like for some reason,
00:44:39 and I find their view of it to be
00:44:41 dumb,
00:44:43 then I could say that that's dumb
00:44:45 because I really...
00:44:47 It depends.
00:44:49 What if they are picking up a small detail
00:44:51 that is there,
00:44:53 as opposed to
00:44:55 getting something wrong
00:44:57 that's clearly wrong.
00:44:59 Those are two very different ways
00:45:01 to view any piece of media.
00:45:03 One, you can counteract.
00:45:05 The other is...
00:45:07 I feel like
00:45:09 it's dumb to say
00:45:11 that this...
00:45:13 No matter how compelling
00:45:15 your reading of a story is,
00:45:17 I think that the one that Rossiter lays out
00:45:19 in the Twin Peaks
00:45:21 video is pretty compelling,
00:45:23 but no matter how good it is,
00:45:25 I think it's really stupid to be like,
00:45:27 okay, this is the right one.
00:45:29 I feel sort of implicit in the way
00:45:31 he lays it out is this idea that
00:45:33 we found the right one,
00:45:35 there is no other one.
00:45:37 That does seem to be the difference.
00:45:39 Come on.
00:45:41 It's funny.
00:45:43 He's got a bit of an ego which I like
00:45:45 and appreciate.
00:45:47 It's not about ego, I just think his critical approach
00:45:49 is very frustrating.
00:45:51 All his videos, they're all like
00:45:53 you're wrong about Man of Steel,
00:45:55 you're wrong about
00:45:57 Justice League or whatever the fuck it is.
00:45:59 I don't mind the ego or the attitude,
00:46:01 but
00:46:03 I just like to be right and I respect
00:46:05 people who are correct.
00:46:07 You know what I mean?
00:46:09 Indeed, I do. By the way,
00:46:11 I got into a little bit on the point
00:46:13 of watching it first or whatever.
00:46:15 When I put out my glowing tweet about
00:46:17 I was just shit talking to these boys.
00:46:19 I was proved so, so foolish.
00:46:21 I am ashamed as a content creator.
00:46:23 Wait, who are you talking shit about?
00:46:25 These people produce actual works of quality.
00:46:27 Who are you talking about?
00:46:29 On the last PCP episode,
00:46:31 I was saying, where is Twin Perfect?
00:46:33 What have they been doing, man?
00:46:35 And then they immediately
00:46:37 afterward come out with this.
00:46:39 I hadn't watched the video,
00:46:41 but I know the effort that Twin Perfect,
00:46:43 that Rossiter puts into these videos.
00:46:45 I felt assured this would not be
00:46:47 any... It's not as produced as
00:46:49 the Silent Hill ones,
00:46:51 but like... Really? Okay.
00:46:53 I mean, it doesn't have any songs
00:46:55 in it or anything like that.
00:46:57 Those were highlights.
00:46:59 Well, okay, fair enough.
00:47:01 But just the little editing they do.
00:47:03 For everyone who thinks that me and Major
00:47:05 are contributing a little too much in this podcast,
00:47:07 I'm sorry.
00:47:09 Apologize.
00:47:11 I gotta know my place here.
00:47:13 Yeah.
00:47:15 I would contribute, but I don't know
00:47:17 what you're talking about.
00:47:19 I haven't seen Twin Peaks or anything,
00:47:21 so I have nothing to say on this topic.
00:47:23 Fair enough.
00:47:25 Some of the shit from the footage
00:47:27 of the new season seems pretty fucking weird.
00:47:31 Let me see.
00:47:33 It's hard to describe in any kind of detail
00:47:35 the shit you see,
00:47:37 but it's just...
00:47:39 It really is me sitting there
00:47:41 on screen and I'm like,
00:47:43 what did he mean by this?
00:47:45 What did he mean by this?
00:47:47 Yeah, I guess.
00:47:49 It does feel, at this particular moment,
00:47:51 six episodes into this 18 episode
00:47:53 Season 3.
00:47:55 It feels too deep for me,
00:47:57 but I'm gonna work my way back.
00:47:59 Wait, was there a reboot of Twin Peaks?
00:48:01 Not a reboot, they just made a new season
00:48:03 that takes place like 25 years in the future.
00:48:05 You kidding?
00:48:07 Yeah, it's just straight up the same story.
00:48:09 I've heard nothing about this.
00:48:11 Like last year, or I think?
00:48:13 I don't know.
00:48:15 I gotta say, it was 2017, I think,
00:48:17 but the biggest thing that makes me sad
00:48:19 is they were not able to get,
00:48:21 because he retired from acting,
00:48:23 the original sheriff from the old two.
00:48:25 Him and Coop were buddies,
00:48:27 they were a team,
00:48:29 and what they have now is
00:48:31 they've got an actor who's playing his brother
00:48:33 also aged up,
00:48:35 and that character is in rehab
00:48:37 or he's off doing something else.
00:48:39 I don't know, it's unfortunate.
00:48:41 I miss that guy, but he's a retired actor.
00:48:43 But they got the log lady,
00:48:45 they got Coop, obviously,
00:48:47 they got the giant who I
00:48:49 suspected would be dead by this point,
00:48:51 but thank god he's not.
00:48:53 He looks like the kind of guy
00:48:55 who's got some kind of congenital thing
00:48:57 that'll kill him before 40.
00:48:59 Just like Tom, just like Tom.
00:49:01 Just like Tom.
00:49:03 Rip.
00:49:05 I think Tom was saying
00:49:07 he might have some weird, minor form
00:49:09 of gigantism of some degree
00:49:11 that's why he's got his finest shoe.
00:49:13 He says that because he's tall,
00:49:15 but he's not like freaky tall.
00:49:17 What if his parents were like four feet tall
00:49:19 and Tom is like six, five, whatever.
00:49:21 Although it is true that I think
00:49:23 that height does inversely correlate
00:49:25 with life expectancy,
00:49:27 like to a small degree.
00:49:29 Oh no.
00:49:31 That's why little dogs
00:49:33 live really long and big dogs live not at all.
00:49:35 Yeah, it's something I don't know
00:49:37 what it is, but like,
00:49:39 yeah, you're fucked.
00:49:41 Manlet master race
00:49:43 rise up.
00:49:47 Yeah, you fucking
00:49:49 manlets are going to have a real hard time
00:49:51 rise enough if you know what I mean.
00:49:59 I've been seeing like this weird
00:50:01 I don't know like how big of a phenomenon
00:50:03 it is. It might not even be a phenomenon,
00:50:05 just like business practices, but like
00:50:07 people who make quote unquote like high media
00:50:09 doing like low media stuff like
00:50:11 Francis Ford Coppola
00:50:13 he was like, you know,
00:50:15 shitting on the Marvel Cinematic Universe, whatever.
00:50:17 I could not give less of a shit about that.
00:50:19 But like people were like, dude, you directed
00:50:21 Jack, like that movie with
00:50:23 Robin Williams. That was like a fucking
00:50:25 joke. And I was like, huh.
00:50:27 Oh yeah. I wonder who else is like that.
00:50:29 And David Lynch, he was actually a voice
00:50:31 actor in the Cleveland show by South
00:50:33 McFarland.
00:50:35 That doesn't surprise me
00:50:37 too much. I feel like he does that kind
00:50:39 of thing. He'll just like show up on
00:50:41 somebody's fucking show or whatever.
00:50:43 Right. It's like a funny little guest
00:50:45 appearance. Twin Peaks can be
00:50:47 very non pretentious at times.
00:50:49 It's very like silly. Okay, but like this is the
00:50:51 guy who made Eraserhead, you know.
00:50:53 I've actually never seen Eraserhead, but
00:50:55 yeah, it's pretty good.
00:50:57 Eraserhead, I know, is from
00:50:59 in academia.
00:51:03 My favorite piece of
00:51:05 my favorite David Lynch piece of
00:51:07 media is
00:51:09 David Lynch cooks quinoa.
00:51:11 Oh yeah. Is that a thing?
00:51:13 Yeah, it's a
00:51:15 oh god, I think it's like 20
00:51:17 minutes or something, but it's like
00:51:19 some guy just goes to David Lynch's
00:51:21 house and films him in his kitchen
00:51:23 and David Lynch cooks
00:51:25 himself dinner and he cooks
00:51:27 some quinoa and broccoli and he tells
00:51:29 him his recipe. Okay. And then he goes
00:51:31 out on the porch and smokes a cigarette
00:51:33 and while he's smoking, he like
00:51:35 tells a little story about
00:51:37 like riding the train through Eastern
00:51:39 Europe and like buying some
00:51:41 weird soda.
00:51:43 Eastern Europe.
00:51:45 And then he like
00:51:47 you go slobby or something and then he
00:51:49 like goes back to finish his quinoa
00:51:51 and like that's it.
00:51:53 But it's really funny because like
00:51:55 the video, it's like it's edited
00:51:57 to be in black, like it's in black and
00:51:59 white. I've got it right here.
00:52:01 Very dramatic lighting and like
00:52:03 he'll make like a little hand gesture
00:52:05 and whoever edited it will add in like
00:52:07 a super dramatic sound effect like boom
00:52:09 like to go along with the story.
00:52:11 It's wicked fucking good.
00:52:13 It's a really good video. Is this
00:52:15 available on YouTube or something?
00:52:17 Yeah, it's in the chat there.
00:52:19 Beautiful. Yeah, I was right.
00:52:21 I think I tried to find this before but I couldn't
00:52:23 but I'm gonna go watch it because
00:52:25 I've always wanted to. Talked about it before.
00:52:27 That's the weirdest. I like that.
00:52:29 And which chat did you link?
00:52:31 It's in general. It's gross disgusting and also
00:52:33 in the general chat in our cinematic universe one.
00:52:35 Okay. That's cute.
00:52:37 Yeah, I like when like these
00:52:39 creatives make like appear
00:52:41 into their lives, you know.
00:52:43 Of course.
00:52:45 There was that like
00:52:47 Miyazaki like workflow documentary.
00:52:49 You remember that one?
00:52:51 Is that the one workflow documentary?
00:52:53 Is that the one where he says that anime was a mistake?
00:52:55 No, it might have been.
00:52:57 I never watched the whole thing. He actually had a new
00:52:59 documentary come out like last year.
00:53:01 I didn't get to watching it. I don't know why.
00:53:03 I just kept on putting it off.
00:53:05 He said something like that.
00:53:07 That got translated in that way.
00:53:09 I'm not even gonna touch it because like I know
00:53:11 I'm gonna get it wrong and then people are gonna give me shit for it.
00:53:13 But like, yeah, you know,
00:53:15 it's the one where it's like he's just like showing
00:53:17 how he makes ramen and it's not even like spectacular
00:53:19 or anything, but it's like, oh,
00:53:21 that's something I know now.
00:53:23 Hey, by the way, on your
00:53:25 subject of Coppola
00:53:27 and whatnot, talking a little bit of smack
00:53:29 on the Marvel films and whatnot,
00:53:31 I just want to put forward the possibility that
00:53:33 they would probably separate
00:53:35 their works that they've done
00:53:37 of ones that they would consider
00:53:39 cinematic quality or like true
00:53:41 cinema versus like Jack, which maybe
00:53:43 they themselves would say, oh yeah, that was just
00:53:45 some trash I made for money.
00:53:47 So they would inflate the two.
00:53:49 Definitely, yeah, that's definitely the distinction
00:53:51 they'd probably make.
00:53:53 Unless they're fucking loony.
00:53:55 Which they might be.
00:53:57 I don't know, maybe Jack is great though.
00:53:59 I haven't seen it.
00:54:01 Didn't Spielberg direct the North Pole
00:54:03 or the Polar Express or whatever?
00:54:05 That was probably
00:54:07 the Norm of the North.
00:54:09 Yes, with Tom Hanks.
00:54:11 Was that like the animated one
00:54:13 with the varying James 3D X?
00:54:15 Yeah, the weird CG Tom Hanks one.
00:54:17 Wait, that was Polar Express?
00:54:19 I think so. Oh god.
00:54:21 No, I remember that coming
00:54:23 on like ABC, like every
00:54:25 Christmas season.
00:54:27 I don't even remember watching the whole thing.
00:54:29 The Polar Express is a beloved, whatever man,
00:54:31 I'm sure everyone says, but the Polar Express,
00:54:33 beloved children's story, I liked in school,
00:54:35 whatever, it's fine, it's cool, who cares.
00:54:37 But then they add like, when they make the movie,
00:54:39 they have to add like action scenes
00:54:41 of the new, like,
00:54:43 worthless Tom Hanks character.
00:54:45 They gotta add like a subplot
00:54:47 where he wins his father's respect or something.
00:54:49 You gotta movie-ify it.
00:54:51 It can't just be boy goes to the North Pole,
00:54:53 which should be like a 15-minute film or whatever,
00:54:55 which is, but they had to make it
00:54:57 like an hour long, so I guess that's why they pat it out.
00:54:59 It's frankly amazing.
00:55:01 Have you guys seen Dumbo, the movie, the remake?
00:55:03 The new one? No.
00:55:05 I have heard all about it.
00:55:07 I have heard all about it. Why?
00:55:09 It just reminded me of how you said,
00:55:11 you can't just be the story, they have to add shit in.
00:55:13 And that's basically it.
00:55:15 That's my point, but they have to add shit in.
00:55:17 I heard that they don't even have the crows.
00:55:21 Yeah, they don't.
00:55:23 Yeah, they're middle-aged.
00:55:25 I'm sure they'd want to whitewash that way.
00:55:27 Whitewash it, know what I'm saying?
00:55:29 What the fuck?
00:55:31 They have a small girl that wishes to become a scientist.
00:55:35 Nice.
00:55:37 You know, I don't remember Dumbo at all.
00:55:39 Were the crows actually like an important narrative element to the story?
00:55:43 Yeah, they sing the fucking elephant,
00:55:45 I've seen an elephant fly song.
00:55:47 They give him the magic feather that makes him think he can fly.
00:55:50 Now the girl gives him the magic feather.
00:55:52 Terrible.
00:55:53 It's all about the girl now.
00:55:55 These fucking SJWs, man,
00:55:57 sticking girls in our stories about
00:55:59 proud, big-tow elephant boys.
00:56:01 I wouldn't even mind it so much,
00:56:03 but she gets so much attention
00:56:05 for no pay-off.
00:56:07 She's been right from the moment the movie started,
00:56:10 and she goes through no arc or anything.
00:56:13 She's always been right, she always knew what to do.
00:56:15 She's there.
00:56:17 Just like Applejack, I didn't learn anything.
00:56:21 But they also, I don't want to shit on a kid,
00:56:24 but the way she delivered the light,
00:56:26 she was just so bad.
00:56:29 I didn't like her actor.
00:56:31 If you got a bad child actor, it's the director's fault.
00:56:34 And she has a little brother,
00:56:36 and she has a little brother,
00:56:38 and he has even less purpose.
00:56:40 She's at least there to be like the play device, basically,
00:56:43 but the little brother just exists.
00:56:45 Why even have a little brother at that point, honestly?
00:56:48 I hear you loud and clear, Mage.
00:56:50 New thing bad, old thing good.
00:56:52 No, no, no.
00:56:54 I'm just complaining that the little brother doesn't have a brother.
00:56:56 Dude, we have to go back.
00:56:58 We have to make America great again.
00:57:00 Bring back the original Dumbo.
00:57:03 I just didn't like the child, the children.
00:57:06 I feel you.
00:57:08 It seems like perfectly reasonable.
00:57:10 Just talking about this stuff from a more holistic standpoint,
00:57:12 I was actually going to bring up the reason
00:57:15 as to why Disney is remaking all these movies.
00:57:17 And I thought, initially, it was because they...
00:57:19 It's got to be money, right?
00:57:21 I thought, and this is the viewpoint
00:57:23 that a lot of people were bringing up.
00:57:25 They thought that they were doing it to renew the copyright,
00:57:27 so it wouldn't enter public domain.
00:57:29 But apparently, that's not true.
00:57:31 I'm researching it right now,
00:57:33 and apparently, that's not the case.
00:57:35 Doesn't copyright last like 80 billion fucking years now?
00:57:38 No, it's like...
00:57:40 It lasts until the creator is dead,
00:57:42 plus another two centuries or some stupid crap.
00:57:44 It's something like almost 100 years for some.
00:57:46 Great.
00:57:48 Yeah, love it.
00:57:50 So I guess it is just straightforward.
00:57:52 It's just about the money.
00:57:54 Just rehashing these IPs.
00:57:56 Epic.
00:57:58 Like, I don't know, 5, 10 deep into these movies,
00:58:01 they would have stopped if these weren't successful.
00:58:04 Everybody hates them,
00:58:06 but they make so much fucking money.
00:58:08 Because it's Disney? I don't know.
00:58:10 It's just Disney again.
00:58:12 Look, here's the thing.
00:58:14 What I saw of the Lion King,
00:58:16 I hated it so much that, like...
00:58:18 I have not heard anyone say anything good
00:58:20 about the Lion King Remake.
00:58:22 I'm not even going to pirate it,
00:58:24 because I don't want to see any of it.
00:58:26 It looked terrible. Yeah, me neither.
00:58:28 It's like, I don't even...
00:58:30 Why translate it to this medium?
00:58:32 Like, with this weird CG crap
00:58:34 where it's talking like the Lion Turtle
00:58:36 from a fucking Avatar The Last Airbender, you know?
00:58:38 Like, that's how all the characters were talking.
00:58:40 It's like, oh, that just looks so weird in CG.
00:58:42 I heard they brought James Earl Jones back
00:58:44 to play Mufasa again,
00:58:46 but he's got to be old as shit.
00:58:48 He's not going to sound like...
00:58:50 I don't know. You know, whatever.
00:58:52 You never stop sounding like James Earl Jones.
00:58:54 I suppose. But you can sound...
00:58:56 Ooh, it's so sad when, like, they bring back
00:58:58 guys who are, like, they're playing the same character.
00:59:00 They're not supposed to have aged,
00:59:02 but we can see they've aged a lot.
00:59:04 Oh, like Jacques. Like Jacques the bird.
00:59:06 Like Jacques the bird, Ben.
00:59:08 Yes, and John Trun's hit new video.
00:59:10 I have not seen the new video, but I saw you
00:59:12 in Hippo speculating on whether Jacques
00:59:14 is getting old. I haven't seen that one.
00:59:16 This was fascinating. We...
00:59:18 Yes, so John Trun made a new video.
00:59:20 It was whatever, selling his merch.
00:59:22 You know, it's funny.
00:59:24 Just some N.U. John dog shit?
00:59:26 Basically, but the funny thing is
00:59:28 we call it N.U.
00:59:30 This is a fascinating concept, actually.
00:59:32 So, like, for the last many, many years,
00:59:34 at this point, probably most
00:59:36 of John's, like, YouTube career or whatever,
00:59:38 probably the vast majority of it,
00:59:40 John has not used Jacques for anything.
00:59:42 And that's because working with Jacques was, like,
00:59:44 hard and he, you know, whatever.
00:59:46 I get work with animals, especially a bird,
00:59:48 probably challenging and hard. I get that.
00:59:50 Nonetheless, this toy, as, like,
00:59:52 a big feature on the toy,
00:59:54 has Jacques on his shoulder
00:59:56 in the toy that's being sold of John.
00:59:58 So it's, like, I don't know.
01:00:00 I feel some kind of way about
01:00:02 we're remembering
01:00:04 the good old days of, like, the classic stuff
01:00:06 that we love John for the most,
01:00:08 but he doesn't do this anymore. Like, none of his new content
01:00:10 is of this style, despite us, like,
01:00:12 we're paying him
01:00:14 for the toy of how he used to be,
01:00:16 but he doesn't do it anymore. So, like, why would we support?
01:00:18 Like, I don't even dislike his character.
01:00:20 Oh, that seems like the whole
01:00:22 John experience in microcosm.
01:00:24 Like, it's just, I feel like
01:00:26 John today only exists
01:00:28 off of, like, momentum from, like,
01:00:30 classic John that everyone was so excited about.
01:00:32 You know, the weird thing about that, Ben?
01:00:34 And now when you see John, it's like, oh, that kind of
01:00:36 that kind of tickles that part
01:00:38 of my brain that used to get excited about
01:00:40 John back then. That's kind of true.
01:00:42 It sort of looks like him. Yes.
01:00:44 The weird thing is just the weird thing.
01:00:46 The weird thing is just how unbelievably
01:00:48 successful all of John's content is,
01:00:50 despite what I would consider
01:00:52 a pretty serious loss of soul.
01:00:54 They're so popular.
01:00:56 Like, 10 million views
01:00:58 per video, which he does every, like, month or two.
01:01:00 No, people love the spectacle, man.
01:01:02 That's all there is to it, you know?
01:01:04 Like, for some of his jokes,
01:01:06 it's literally just like,
01:01:08 I spent $1,000 on this
01:01:10 prop. Bam! I just destroyed it.
01:01:12 Ha, ha, ha.
01:01:14 I don't think there even is that much spectacle.
01:01:16 I don't know. I don't feel like when a new
01:01:18 John drops, it's like a fucking extravaganza.
01:01:20 It's just, I've only seen
01:01:22 a few of the newer ones, but they just seem
01:01:24 like the same old shit. Like, half of them,
01:01:26 he's literally just sitting on a couch.
01:01:28 You know, honestly, I want to give credit to John.
01:01:30 I don't even really dislike his new videos.
01:01:32 I've watched some of the new ones, and I have enjoyed them
01:01:34 because there's a lot of, like,
01:01:36 he does, like, practical effects.
01:01:38 To quote Mr. Plinkett,
01:01:40 I'd rather see them than blood in my
01:01:42 stool, but...
01:01:44 Well, I, true.
01:01:46 But, like, look, I, I, yeah, I, I love the guy
01:01:48 because, like, he would make video game things
01:01:50 that were really funny. I could, like, relate to it as an epic
01:01:52 game or whatnot. That's fine. That identity
01:01:54 is established for the guy. Now he just
01:01:56 makes pretty much more straightforward,
01:01:58 absurdist comedy or whatever. But he
01:02:00 re, you can really tell.
01:02:02 He is passionate about it, and he works
01:02:04 hard, and he has vision.
01:02:06 Even when I didn't like the videos, like, at all,
01:02:08 and I, we were all like, oh, why is he in this weird
01:02:10 set? Feels a little more natural now.
01:02:12 I, I really do respect
01:02:14 his work ethic and his, like,
01:02:16 dedication to the craft. Like, nobody
01:02:18 is putting as much work or effort
01:02:20 into his videos as John.
01:02:22 So just on that front, I, I am impressed.
01:02:24 You know, you know, it's, it's the funniest thing.
01:02:26 What do you mean he's putting work into them?
01:02:28 I mean, he's getting practical effects.
01:02:30 He's getting actors. He's getting, like,
01:02:32 skits that he's scripting out. He's
01:02:34 going to live action places in the real
01:02:36 world. Wait, did, did, did not think
01:02:38 he's putting work into them.
01:02:40 I don't know. I guess that's not your point, Ben.
01:02:42 It's something else. I've seen a couple, and I,
01:02:44 I wasn't, like, very impressed.
01:02:46 I mean, he's putting work into them, regardless.
01:02:48 Like, maybe the, maybe it's like, maybe
01:02:50 I haven't seen the right ones.
01:02:52 Like, the direction might be misplaced, but, like,
01:02:54 the work is definitely there.
01:02:56 They're, like, he did a video
01:02:58 for, I forget what it is. Let me watch this
01:03:00 jock exposed. Okay, fine.
01:03:02 Well, this one isn't particularly, it's
01:03:04 two minutes long. I want to watch it too.
01:03:06 Um, it's horseshit. Yeah.
01:03:08 One second and then it's horseshit.
01:03:10 Whatever, man.
01:03:12 No, but there's nothing good, nothing good
01:03:14 about this. Okay. In one of the videos, I
01:03:16 forget what it is. Oh, it was the goop
01:03:18 one. It was the one he did for goop. At the
01:03:20 end, he does this whole thing where he goes
01:03:22 into, like, is that recent? Yes, that was
01:03:24 the last, like, couple of months or something. Yeah.
01:03:26 Oh, found it. Okay, goop. Okay, there you go.
01:03:28 Like, skip to the end. He does a thing where
01:03:30 he, they've, like, produced an actual,
01:03:32 excuse me, fucking
01:03:34 a thing. He is literally
01:03:36 being a snake oil salesman.
01:03:38 Funny. That's a funny joke. He's being a snake
01:03:40 oil salesman. They set up in real life
01:03:42 across the street from an actual
01:03:44 practical goop store that he's
01:03:46 mocking. Oh, yeah, I saw that. He's hocking on the
01:03:48 street, like, he's in full costume,
01:03:50 he's got a script he's doing, and he's got
01:03:52 the whole snake oil, like, cart
01:03:54 set up. He's doing a Nathan Fielder. I am
01:03:56 impressed by that effort. That is cool.
01:03:58 Yeah, okay. I like that. See what I'm saying?
01:04:00 No, this is good. This is a good costume and set
01:04:02 all that. That's a good one. That's playing the Nathan Fielder.
01:04:04 Um, I don't care.
01:04:06 Like, who on YouTube is doing that?
01:04:08 I don't know many. You know what? You know what?
01:04:10 When you have as much money as John Tron does,
01:04:12 literally nothing you do is impressive anymore.
01:04:14 Right, but look, it's all in red. What do you mean?
01:04:16 What do you mean? Oh, you just get on the phone
01:04:18 and say, hey, pay someone to make this happen,
01:04:20 and then they'll do it for you. You have no
01:04:22 idea what's involved in writing. Yes, I do.
01:04:24 You gotta have the visions, like, make it come
01:04:26 together. I guess.
01:04:28 I guess. How much vision do you really need?
01:04:30 Just straight of credit, if nothing else.
01:04:32 It's bullshit.
01:04:34 You guys gotta, like, realize that this is
01:04:36 all in relation to, like, his old content,
01:04:38 which was, like, you know,
01:04:40 as tier, you know? So it's like,
01:04:42 in terms of, like, being a reaction YouTuber,
01:04:44 he's still, like, one of the best.
01:04:46 I think he is.
01:04:48 I respect what he's doing.
01:04:50 He's fine. I don't hate him.
01:04:52 I don't hate listening to him.
01:04:54 But I don't know.
01:04:56 You know what?
01:04:58 It's just, it's just...
01:05:00 I just... Die, John.
01:05:02 I don't know why. I don't have any desire
01:05:04 to fucking open up a John Tron video
01:05:06 anymore. Sure. The magic's
01:05:08 gone. Maybe it's me.
01:05:10 Maybe I'm the problem. I don't know.
01:05:12 I get what you're saying, because, like, you know,
01:05:14 I see the videos pop up on my feed and I don't click them.
01:05:16 Like, I... Me neither. Me neither.
01:05:18 Most of the time. Glad John's doing well.
01:05:20 But you know what? I did watch,
01:05:22 just recently, I went back and I watched
01:05:24 his Banjo and Kanzui
01:05:26 Mass and Bolts review. You know, this was, like, the video
01:05:28 that was, like, the most famous of his.
01:05:30 That made him hit the big screen.
01:05:32 You know, the big scene, whatever.
01:05:34 And it was... It was
01:05:36 very good. And I should keep in mind
01:05:38 I have seen it many times and loved it.
01:05:40 I'd call it, like, an 8.
01:05:42 I call it, like, an 8, currently.
01:05:44 I don't know.
01:05:46 Maybe I've changed. YouTube has evolved.
01:05:48 Is it fair to compare, you know,
01:05:50 things of that nature to what we got now?
01:05:52 I don't know. It's still a legendary video
01:05:54 where he waves and it deserves respect for that.
01:05:56 You know, kind of set the field for a lot of
01:05:58 epic game reviewers with editing
01:06:00 and goofy gaffy skits and whatnot.
01:06:02 So, whatever. I respect him on that.
01:06:04 It was a fun time. I don't know.
01:06:06 It was a good era.
01:06:08 It was a good era. It was a good era.
01:06:10 This is when him and John, or him and Aaron,
01:06:12 were, like, first forming Game Grumps, I believe.
01:06:14 It was actually, it was, like, after some videos
01:06:16 I thought were more recent, this Banjo one.
01:06:18 Whatever. I don't know. It was impressive.
01:06:20 We all know that was, like,
01:06:22 that was him being a gamer.
01:06:24 That was him tapping into his identity
01:06:26 for its purest, most,
01:06:28 I don't know, distilled,
01:06:30 gamerous cred and he was
01:06:32 capitalizing on.
01:06:34 You know, there's one other thing about
01:06:36 John that I must say,
01:06:38 I find extremely attractive.
01:06:40 And that is
01:06:42 his race, his realism.
01:06:44 Oh, boy.
01:06:48 It's like this
01:06:50 total
01:06:52 lack of need to work at anybody's
01:06:54 pace but his own.
01:06:56 And, you know, maybe just because he's so rich or whatever, he doesn't care.
01:06:58 He's got the leverage.
01:07:00 Of course he doesn't have to do anything.
01:07:02 But he was like that all along, you know.
01:07:04 He quit Game Grumps for that reason.
01:07:06 I feel like, yeah,
01:07:08 I'm just not a fucking bootlicker, okay?
01:07:10 That's, that's my thing.
01:07:12 Sorry if that's weird.
01:07:14 Who's boot am I looking here?
01:07:16 Oh, wow, look at this, wow, look at this incredible set
01:07:18 that he made. Yeah, he's got like an $800 billion.
01:07:20 He can make any set he wants.
01:07:22 It's not a challenge. Oh my,
01:07:24 you don't even know what it's financed. You have no idea.
01:07:26 How much do you think that card cost
01:07:28 to make, Nate?
01:07:30 Maybe, well, he probably
01:07:32 rented it. He probably didn't buy it, right?
01:07:34 Rent it from somewhere and then you deck it out.
01:07:36 Maybe a couple thousand tops.
01:07:38 Okay, but regardless of the price, it's a pretty neat card.
01:07:40 So what?
01:07:42 There's a bunch of things
01:07:44 that cost a shit ton
01:07:46 and look ugly as fuck.
01:07:48 Here's the difference between me and you.
01:07:50 I, I watch a Marvel movie
01:07:52 and I don't, like, or actually
01:07:54 I don't do that, but if I did do that,
01:07:56 I would, I would see, I would see some
01:07:58 CG and be like, it's not,
01:08:00 I would never be impressed by it, because like,
01:08:02 of course they have all this beautiful CG.
01:08:04 They paid like 8,000 people
01:08:06 to spend like two years a piece making it.
01:08:08 I agree, I agree. So my point
01:08:10 is that it's not impressive.
01:08:12 Look, the scale, I think
01:08:14 the difference here is the scale of
01:08:16 the point is that the Marvel has this
01:08:18 disposal versus John and his YouTube channel.
01:08:20 I'm not impressed by budget.
01:08:22 Well, that's not fair to the people who actually did
01:08:24 work on the CG and make it look impressive.
01:08:26 Right, a lot of people.
01:08:28 Right, you know, it's like, it's all these resources.
01:08:30 A lot of people can do the work, but it's like
01:08:32 you have to put someone in charge who knows like
01:08:34 what they're doing. So it's like, it's,
01:08:36 if you don't, if you don't care about the money,
01:08:38 sure, fine, you know?
01:08:40 Disney has a shit ton of money, but Lion King
01:08:42 still looks like shit.
01:08:44 Exactly, you have to put the right people in charge.
01:08:46 Even if this is like a gorgeous
01:08:48 card, even if you're like, oh my god,
01:08:50 I am living for this card.
01:08:52 I am here for it right now.
01:08:54 We will never know who made this card.
01:08:56 It wasn't John.
01:08:58 Dude, I couldn't give a shit about the card.
01:09:00 It's like, what context the card
01:09:02 exists in, you know? It's like, was the joke
01:09:04 funny? It's like, who could
01:09:06 have thought of that joke?
01:09:08 To be fair, I didn't watch the whole video
01:09:10 so I don't know if the joke's funny.
01:09:12 I don't believe it. I can appreciate
01:09:14 and sympathize with your point.
01:09:16 I really do. I just think that this joke
01:09:18 is funny and it's well
01:09:20 done. So I guess that's my main point.
01:09:22 It might very well be. I feel I can separate
01:09:24 the money issue, which I agree
01:09:26 is legitimate. I'm not saying
01:09:28 I'm not even saying fuck John for having money.
01:09:30 I'm just saying I'm not impressed by
01:09:32 the presence of like cool sets and
01:09:34 costumes because like, yeah, of course
01:09:36 he would have those things. Better than the set
01:09:38 costume is going across
01:09:40 the side from Goop
01:09:42 and being a snake oil salesman in real life.
01:09:44 Just that concept. Very funny.
01:09:46 What is Goop, by the way?
01:09:48 Goop is Gwyneth Paltrow's obviously
01:09:50 retarded, like, lifestyle
01:09:52 brand of stupid Goops and
01:09:54 Essences. They've got, they literally
01:09:56 have magnets that you're supposed to like
01:09:58 attach to yourself that are supposed to like
01:10:00 balance your chi. Like shit like that.
01:10:02 Shit like that. Maybe you should watch
01:10:04 the video before criticizing it then.
01:10:06 I'm not criticizing the video.
01:10:08 I'm just saying, I'm just
01:10:10 I'm literally just saying fuck you.
01:10:12 That's all I'm saying.
01:10:14 Well, that's all I want. That's all I want.
01:10:16 Okay. All right.
01:10:18 Well, agree to disagree, I guess.
01:10:20 God damn it. I had
01:10:22 another Rockstar, X-Durance
01:10:24 marshmallow flavor and I can't find it.
01:10:26 Give me 30 seconds. I gotta
01:10:28 check downstairs. That's not fair.
01:10:30 If he's going to get his marshmallow, I want to get
01:10:32 my apple juice. Apple juice?
01:10:34 Go for it, I guess. I'll just
01:10:36 fill time. Hey, I'll tell you what.
01:10:38 I actually started a website
01:10:40 recently. Yeah. It's
01:10:42 philip. S-O-S-S-O-U-R-T
01:10:44 dot com.
01:10:46 That's my art website. Put that in the links.
01:10:48 That's for all my
01:10:50 Well, it's for my animation ventures
01:10:52 and for like drawing and all that stuff
01:10:54 to have a place for me to
01:10:56 post your shit. Exactly.
01:10:58 Exactly. You know,
01:11:00 situate it all. But also,
01:11:02 I'm a big fan of puppets. I don't know
01:11:04 Okay, I'm back. I don't know when I got into
01:11:06 puppets. It might have been
01:11:08 just like, you know, going into Jim
01:11:10 Henson's shit, but like, I've been really
01:11:12 into it and I want to
01:11:14 incorporate it into my videos. I like
01:11:16 You're a man of many talents. I played
01:11:18 around with it a little bit for one
01:11:20 video and then I never did it again.
01:11:22 You know? Okay. I have a bad habit of that.
01:11:24 I want to see an R-long, not an R-long, an
01:11:26 R-low collab immediately.
01:11:28 Puppet Boys of YouTube.
01:11:30 It's time. It's the craziest stuff.
01:11:32 Um, yeah, I have like,
01:11:34 I just literally have
01:11:36 like, fur
01:11:38 halfway to the ceiling
01:11:40 next to me. You know, all these materials
01:11:42 I've just been stacking up and I just
01:11:44 haven't had the time
01:11:46 to do it because I've just been stuffed.
01:11:48 So like, the weekend freeing up for me
01:11:50 it's a blessing. I should have done it a long time ago.
01:11:52 So you can make these puppets for
01:11:54 producing in videos. For producing in videos.
01:11:56 Yes. Oh my god. I'm so excited. I'm so hyped.
01:11:58 You're filled with that. Dude, I'm so hyped.
01:12:00 You've always actually on YouTube been like a
01:12:02 Jon Trons spirit. You just do exactly what you want to do
01:12:04 exactly as you feel like it. Yeah. Oh my god.
01:12:06 At least that's how it seems to me. I've always thought that.
01:12:08 Yeah, it's so liberating, you know?
01:12:10 It's like, uh... I mean, now that I've made it my
01:12:12 fucking job, oh god, let me tell you.
01:12:14 It's a fucking bummer. Speaking of liberating,
01:12:16 I've done nothing on social media.
01:12:18 I've been sort of like, away
01:12:20 from social media for as much as I can
01:12:22 and it's been pretty liberating.
01:12:24 That's true. I feel so chill.
01:12:26 I feel so zen. I've played like
01:12:28 91 hours on Fire Emblem and Three Houses.
01:12:30 That's been fun.
01:12:32 Was this really an improvement in your life
01:12:34 is the real question? Yes. Yes, it has.
01:12:36 I've been so happy. I love
01:12:38 that game. I love my new Switch.
01:12:40 It's great. It's fantastic.
01:12:42 I don't remember the last time I've been so happy
01:12:44 with my life. Say you got a new Switch?
01:12:46 Sounds like a great investment then. Yesterday.
01:12:48 Wait, not yesterday. A few days ago
01:12:50 a miracle happened. So me and my boyfriend
01:12:52 we ordered pizzas for one for each
01:12:54 and they messed up one of the pizzas,
01:12:56 my boyfriend's pizza. So they gave us
01:12:58 that messed up pizza for free.
01:13:00 So we got three pizzas.
01:13:02 That's the story I want to hear about.
01:13:04 That's epic. One time
01:13:06 my people, we ordered
01:13:08 hamburgers, right?
01:13:10 My one friend Lorenz
01:13:12 he made the order for everyone,
01:13:14 right? And then we got the order,
01:13:16 right? And they messed up
01:13:18 like one burger, right?
01:13:20 Like one guy got the wrong burger.
01:13:22 I got the right burger. My burger was fine.
01:13:24 But he's like
01:13:26 oh, they fucked up our order. And he called them
01:13:28 up and he's like, he's just like, he's on the phone
01:13:30 like, yeah, no, these burgers are all fucked up.
01:13:32 No, he just gave us the wrong burgers.
01:13:34 And I'm like, actually, my burger's fine. He's like,
01:13:36 no, no, no, no, yeah, they're all fucked up.
01:13:38 And we just got a second burger. I just got two burgers.
01:13:40 It was great. That burger is epic.
01:13:42 I don't care.
01:13:46 I use kind of vague language if I was calling.
01:13:48 I'd be like, yeah, there's like some issues with our order.
01:13:50 I'd really appreciate it if you guys could fix it
01:13:52 and just like give us, you know, this is
01:13:54 what I like to do. I never tell lies.
01:13:56 This is the thing I do. But you can
01:13:58 talk your way around lies to effectively
01:14:00 lie. This wasn't me. I didn't do this.
01:14:02 I didn't do this because my burger was fine.
01:14:04 That's fair. That's fair.
01:14:06 I condemn this friend of yours. I disavow
01:14:08 he or she, I don't know.
01:14:10 They seem like they're a ruffian, a rapscallian.
01:14:12 I'll have none of it, sir.
01:14:14 That's all true.
01:14:16 You know, if we're still on the subject
01:14:18 of food, I've only been
01:14:20 eating one meal a day
01:14:22 and it's only been Burger King
01:14:24 or McDonald's.
01:14:26 I don't know if that's good or bad because
01:14:28 it's like, I guess
01:14:30 all the food that's going in me is bad, but it's like
01:14:32 I'm not eating the large quantity of it, you know?
01:14:34 It's counter balanced by the intermittent
01:14:36 fasting of eating once a day or whatever it's called.
01:14:38 That's my thought process
01:14:40 doing this.
01:14:42 I heal you. I heal again.
01:14:44 Sometimes we've been ordering pizza
01:14:46 every now and then. I only need to eat just the one
01:14:48 pizza that day and the next day
01:14:50 I've lost some calories.
01:14:52 It's really good.
01:14:54 I can have a
01:14:56 pizza diet.
01:14:58 It's beautiful. Well, no, you just got to do
01:15:00 what Oolulia does and degrease your pizza.
01:15:02 I mean, that sure would make
01:15:04 a pretty decent difference.
01:15:06 Well, you just take your napkins and you soak up the grease
01:15:08 off all your pizza. Okay, but what if my pizza
01:15:10 isn't all that greasy?
01:15:12 Then you've already degreased it. I guess you're in good company.
01:15:14 Well, you see, I don't actually
01:15:16 at the end of the press
01:15:18 that don't have anything, it's just bread. I don't
01:15:20 eat that. As a keto man,
01:15:22 what I recommend is
01:15:24 ordering a pizza, degreasing it
01:15:26 and then throwing away the pizza and just
01:15:28 eating the greasy napkins because
01:15:30 only the fat is good. Everything else
01:15:32 is poison and cause inflammation.
01:15:34 I can't eat the fat. Listen,
01:15:36 Jack Spratt could eat no fat. His wife
01:15:38 could eat no lean. Okay, here's the thing.
01:15:40 I got
01:15:42 was off keto and then
01:15:44 over the last couple days we've gotten back on it
01:15:46 and I literally went from
01:15:48 being fat to being skinny.
01:15:50 It's disgusting. The difference is
01:15:52 ridiculous. I can't believe
01:15:54 how absolutely heinous I was
01:15:56 four days ago and how
01:15:58 gorgeous I am today.
01:16:02 I was so distressed.
01:16:04 I was so distressed four days ago looking at myself
01:16:06 in the mirror like, God, how did this happen so fast?
01:16:08 And now I'm so euphoric
01:16:10 today, tips fedora
01:16:12 because like it's fixed, solved,
01:16:14 problem solved, no biggie.
01:16:16 Do you track your weight in there or anything?
01:16:18 I haven't been weighing myself lately, no.
01:16:20 Okay. For a while I was, but I haven't
01:16:22 counted calories. I haven't been counting calories
01:16:24 so in the last month I was like 3
01:16:26 kilograms or so.
01:16:28 3 kilograms? That's like 40 pounds
01:16:30 in a month here.
01:16:32 Wait, is that true?
01:16:34 That's like 100 pounds, dude.
01:16:36 What? That's not 100
01:16:38 pounds. No, it's just 3.
01:16:40 Yeah, it's like a thousand pounds.
01:16:42 That's like infinity pounds.
01:16:44 Oh man.
01:16:46 I don't exist anymore.
01:16:48 I haven't been great about my diet particularly,
01:16:50 but the one thing I have been doing, which is kind of more important,
01:16:52 I've been doing the W diet, the whatever
01:16:54 diet that I've advertised,
01:16:56 I've been doing it for like four months now
01:16:58 and I've lost like over
01:17:00 10 pounds at this point
01:17:02 and I mean that's a little slow, you could lose weight faster
01:17:04 than that, but all I've been doing
01:17:06 is counting my calories and all that does
01:17:08 is make me aware of what I'm eating
01:17:10 and so I can eat a little less of that.
01:17:12 Yeah, exactly, same thing. I've been counting calories.
01:17:14 I've also set a limit of how many calories I can eat per day.
01:17:16 Wise, yep, yep, that's the way to do it.
01:17:18 It's funny, when I went on
01:17:20 the pizza party
01:17:22 podcast
01:17:24 and talked about Keto
01:17:26 because I had gone
01:17:28 and listened to some like recent episodes
01:17:30 and I had heard Izzy
01:17:32 talk about how she was like doing Keto
01:17:34 and so I'm like
01:17:36 hey, uh, Izzy
01:17:38 I hear you're a Keto guy
01:17:40 and she's like, yeah
01:17:42 and I'm like, yeah, me too, awesome
01:17:44 and she's like, oh, she was like
01:17:46 I think she thought I was going to attack her for it
01:17:48 or something
01:17:50 like fuck you
01:17:52 eat some carbs, fucking asshole
01:17:54 put up those apprehensive shields
01:17:56 Yeah, yeah, she's right to be afraid
01:17:58 obviously
01:18:00 but in this case it was
01:18:02 unnecessary
01:18:04 Directly after gamers
01:18:06 it's the people who do Keto
01:18:08 Keto people
01:18:10 Indeed, that is how it
01:18:12 I couldn't find
01:18:14 I couldn't find my fucking
01:18:16 my fucking marshmallow
01:18:18 Rockstar Exdurance
01:18:20 Oh no, well deal with it
01:18:22 On the way here, I got two
01:18:24 I got, what, why is it like
01:18:26 fucking what?
01:18:28 This can is like smashed
01:18:30 I'm terrified
01:18:32 No, never
01:18:34 How does that stuff affect you?
01:18:36 It barely does
01:18:38 Energy drinks fuck me up, dude
01:18:40 I am like totally
01:18:42 immune to them now
01:18:44 My tolerance is so high
01:18:46 What's up?
01:18:48 Guess what day today is
01:18:50 Why is it special?
01:18:52 Is it your birthday?
01:18:54 27th
01:18:56 Daylight savings
01:18:58 Well, yes, but no
01:19:00 No, it's not
01:19:02 Daylight savings
01:19:04 It's National Black Cat Day
01:19:06 No kidding
01:19:08 Black cat day, no way
01:19:10 Yeah, I love that manga
01:19:12 You guys don't even know
01:19:14 what that is, I bet
01:19:16 I do
01:19:18 You probably know, you probably know
01:19:20 That's incredible
01:19:22 Happy day of black cats to my cat
01:19:24 because he's a black boy
01:19:26 Oh, that's nice
01:19:28 Happy black cat day to Luna
01:19:30 which is a hippos cat
01:19:32 Well, I hope you enjoy it
01:19:34 You know, my
01:19:36 My rotund little guy
01:19:38 My little baby dog, Sessho
01:19:40 He is black, he is a dog
01:19:42 He wants to be included
01:19:44 He has spent this entire episode
01:19:46 I've got a blanket around my legs and feet
01:19:48 He has been in that blanket
01:19:50 on my feet
01:19:52 You're like those fucking people
01:19:54 in October who draw digitally
01:19:56 and think you're right
01:19:58 Whoa, coming from my neck last year
01:20:00 You're gonna have a party
01:20:02 You're gonna have a party
01:20:04 and you don't include everyone
01:20:06 That's like racist
01:20:08 Everyone wants a participation trophy
01:20:10 Sessho's a guest of honor
01:20:14 Sessho's a guest of honor
01:20:16 He's allowed, I am allowed
01:20:18 Okay, well thank you
01:20:20 Speaking of Sessho
01:20:22 Tomorrow, he's going to camp
01:20:24 He's going to camp for a couple of days
01:20:26 because me and Michelle
01:20:28 No, it's not fat camp
01:20:30 It's normal camp
01:20:36 We're going to visit
01:20:38 Digi out in Virginia
01:20:40 and we're gonna hang out with them
01:20:42 and Vic and Hope, presumably as well
01:20:44 Yep, gonna visit them for Halloween
01:20:46 and just, I don't know, maybe film some stuff
01:20:48 We'll see
01:20:50 We'll do
01:20:52 That sounds like a blast
01:20:56 Let me see, we'll be there
01:20:58 Today is Sunday
01:21:00 By the time everyone hears this
01:21:02 I will literally be on my way home
01:21:04 a little late for that
01:21:06 We'll probably do goofy stuff
01:21:08 Me and Zen and Munchie and Kazzy
01:21:10 will be having way more fun
01:21:12 than you
01:21:14 Watching Spooky Movies
01:21:16 Are we actually gonna do that
01:21:18 Because I've never watched Spooky Movies
01:21:20 I hate Spooky Movies
01:21:22 Watch Focus
01:21:24 Watch The Exorcist
01:21:26 The Exorcist is a great movie
01:21:28 I might consider watching The Exorcist
01:21:30 The only problem is The Exorcist is a little
01:21:32 It's like an actual
01:21:34 really good movie so you want to pay attention
01:21:36 which isn't great for like a party setting
01:21:38 or like hanging out with your bros
01:21:40 Watch Scary Movie 3
01:21:42 I don't know, that's more your speed
01:21:44 No
01:21:46 That's right
01:21:48 Is that the one with the 3?
01:21:50 No, never
01:21:52 That's for babies
01:21:54 That's the one where everyone makes fun
01:21:56 of the kid for being a virgin
01:21:58 Is that true?
01:22:00 Yes
01:22:02 That hits too close to home
01:22:04 It can't be happening
01:22:06 All these grown ass women
01:22:08 are teasing this 13 year old boy
01:22:10 for being a virgin
01:22:12 You see Bender
01:22:14 subverting the trope of
01:22:16 having the virgin woman
01:22:18 be victimized in horror films
01:22:20 by having it be a 13 year old boy
01:22:22 It's genius
01:22:24 Yeah, that might be true
01:22:26 That doesn't make it like
01:22:28 not super uncomfortable
01:22:30 I don't think they were actually teasing him
01:22:32 I think what they were doing was like
01:22:34 they needed a virgin for like a spell or something
01:22:36 No, they are definitely
01:22:38 You were actually
01:22:40 I do remember like
01:22:42 the spell or whatever
01:22:44 to summon them back in
01:22:46 The candle had to be lit by a virgin
01:22:48 or something like that
01:22:50 Everyone assumed it had to be
01:22:52 a female I think
01:22:54 and then specifically stated
01:22:56 ended up being lit by the boy
01:22:58 That's fucked up
01:23:00 Wild shit
01:23:02 I'm just saying, you can push a gamer
01:23:04 but one day you push a gamer too far
01:23:06 and on that day you'll learn to regret it
01:23:08 Veronica
01:23:10 Stacey, you'll learn
01:23:12 My people will rise up
01:23:14 It's tough out here for these gamers
01:23:16 Guys, I did it
01:23:18 I found my Marshmallow Rockstar Extern
01:23:20 You'll never guess where it was
01:23:22 You'll never guess where it was
01:23:24 In the refrigerator
01:23:26 You don't deserve any congratulations
01:23:28 It's always in the last place you look
01:23:30 Oh, you know what
01:23:32 I just reminded all of a sudden
01:23:34 Speaking of the last place you look
01:23:36 at the beginning of the episode I completely forgot
01:23:38 But now I can say it, it's that ladies and gentlemen
01:23:40 It's time
01:23:42 to head on over to patreon.com
01:23:44 PCP Minecraft
01:23:46 and join the PCP Minecraft server
01:23:48 Because we got it up and running baby
01:23:50 We're back in business
01:23:52 It's a thriving community, I know it took us weeks
01:23:54 but we fixed it seemingly every problem
01:23:56 Whatever, you get like a lag spike once or twice
01:23:58 It's an online game, deal with it pussy
01:24:00 This is it, Minecraft is alive forever
01:24:02 We'll happily take

01:24:22 you will still get this bonus sorry kit
01:24:24 and that's just a little present for most of you
01:24:26 Wait a minute, I think by the time this episode

01:24:42 which helps you mine faster

01:24:54 in the dark

01:25:18 It's just so nice
01:25:20 I love meming
01:25:22 I love when people do memes
01:25:24 It's so good
01:25:26 I love memes, I swear
01:25:28 They're so funny
01:25:30 I gotta say your enthusiasm
01:25:32 for this project is kind of infectious
01:25:34 It is infectious
01:25:36 SlimecorpHQ
01:25:38 rises higher every day
01:25:40 brick by brick by brick
01:25:42 crushing the hopes and dreams of the wage slaves of the world
01:25:44 Slime they had for mortar
01:25:46 brick and stone
01:25:48 What's the fucking bible quote?
01:25:50 Yeah, it's the original slime quote
01:25:52 I got it for you
01:25:54 It is
01:25:56 And they had brick for stone
01:25:58 and slime they had for mortar
01:26:00 Done
01:26:02 It's being constructed out of
01:26:04 a black concrete
01:26:06 clear green glass
01:26:08 and a beautiful marble
01:26:10 Oh, I can't wait
01:26:12 I'm gonna build 13 floors plus the lobby
01:26:14 for the 13th N members
01:26:16 Ooh, it's gonna be glorious
01:26:18 I'm gonna use my god powers to make an underground empire
01:26:20 Great idea
01:26:22 Has anyone seen
01:26:24 I've probably talked about
01:26:26 fucking the Yogscast
01:26:28 and like their
01:26:30 Minecraft series
01:26:32 You have told us many times, but they are
01:26:34 They continue to be fascinating
01:26:36 Exclusively Minecraft YouTubers, right?
01:26:38 Originally
01:26:40 They started that way
01:26:42 They branched off into other things
01:26:44 and now they are fucking like scary
01:26:46 evil capitalists that own everything
01:26:48 It's like
01:26:50 Ain't that just the way
01:26:52 Absolutely boot-shakingly terrifying
01:26:54 to like switch over
01:26:56 from doing like one video game
01:26:58 for your whole career
01:27:00 to just like wanting to branch out, you know
01:27:02 And like a lot of people can't make that jump
01:27:04 I mean, I think they started on
01:27:06 as World of Warcraft guys
01:27:08 Oh yeah, okay
01:27:10 I think they got popular among like wow
01:27:12 wow communities and then they switched to Minecraft
01:27:14 If you remember
01:27:16 the old fuck himself, old Dunkey
01:27:18 Remember Dunkey? I still enjoy Dunkey
01:27:20 I mean, Dunkey's still around
01:27:22 I don't know why you're talking about him in the past tense
01:27:24 Rest his soul, Dunkey
01:27:26 Good to run, but you know
01:27:28 He's gotten pretty fat though
01:27:30 So I mean maybe
01:27:32 He's on his way out
01:27:34 You know, not to me mean, because this is kind of like the high water mark
01:27:36 But like it's funny to watch
01:27:38 more and more like YouTubers are getting married
01:27:40 Dunkey got married recently as well
01:27:42 It's fun for me to compare them each
01:27:44 to PewDiePie's wedding
01:27:46 and see like how much
01:27:48 silence was off the charts
01:27:50 I mean, he's a literal millionaire
01:27:52 Obviously, I'm just saying
01:27:54 My wedding, whenever it happens
01:27:56 will obviously be nothing compared to this as well
01:27:58 I didn't watch PewDiePie's wedding video
01:28:00 How was it?
01:28:02 Well, his actual wedding video was like
01:28:04 an overdone, saccharine, like not funny
01:28:06 Like, oh I actually love my wife, lol
01:28:08 Idiot
01:28:10 Boo, don't want to hear about it, shut up
01:28:12 Sounds like a bunch of malarkey
01:28:14 It was a bunch of malarkey Zen
01:28:16 I post marriage and I post job
01:28:18 and I post life and I post food
01:28:20 I post all of this bullshit
01:28:22 Post existence
01:28:24 Exactly, I want to be pure energy
01:28:26 I'd be a millionaire too
01:28:28 God, I'm looking at this timeline
01:28:30 I just went to the Yogscast fan Wiki
01:28:32 Can you like it?
01:28:34 And I'm looking at like a timeline
01:28:36 of like all the different Minecraft series
01:28:38 they did
01:28:40 and like some of them overlapped
01:28:42 because some of them were running at the same time
01:28:44 Some people would have like YouTube
01:28:46 Minecraft series that were set
01:28:48 in like the same servers, right?
01:28:50 But sort of telling like separate stories
01:28:52 Man, there's so many more
01:28:54 than I've never seen
01:28:56 Like I've seen Shadow of Israel
01:28:58 is the big one that most people know
01:29:00 and then on top of like after that
01:29:02 like that transition into Duncan's laboratory
01:29:04 and then there was the Jaffa Factory
01:29:06 and Sipsco
01:29:08 The Jaffa Factory and Sipsco
01:29:10 I remember Jaffa Factory and Sipsco
01:29:12 they fucking went on and did it for years and years
01:29:14 and years and I will never ever watch
01:29:16 all this content but it sort of
01:29:18 makes me happy that it exists
01:29:20 That's cute, that's nice
01:29:22 It's good, it's good shit
01:29:24 Well, it looks like it ended around
01:29:26 late 2016 but I don't know
01:29:28 Maybe it continues
01:29:30 and this chart's just out of date
01:29:32 Yeah, please link that chart man, link the chart
01:29:34 so we can all cruise
01:29:36 I mean you will just, it'll just
01:29:38 be a bunch of names that you don't
01:29:40 understand because that's what it is for me
01:29:42 I can only
01:29:44 speculate as to the content of
01:29:46 Flux Buddies
01:29:48 or
01:29:50 Druids Downtown
01:29:56 Yeah, well, they sound enchanting
01:29:58 and I hope it's more than one day
01:30:00 I'm fucking charmed
01:30:04 Well, I mean we could go to voicemails if you want
01:30:06 I don't know, it's
01:30:08 talking about a bunch of bullshit
01:30:10 Yeah, we can go for an hour and a half
01:30:12 Yeah, alright, alright
01:30:14 Let's pull them up here, alright sick
01:30:16 You don't have a choice then, you have to
01:30:18 I am but a pretender
01:30:20 in this house
01:30:22 Okay, where does this go? This goes to the commander
01:30:24 Alright people, you know the drill, speak pipe
01:30:26 leave us voicemails, link below, click
01:30:28 play, record, there you go
01:30:30 Alright, first one, oh boy, okay
01:30:32 we're starting strong
01:30:34 First voicemails from I Need To Get Laid
01:30:36 Now!
01:30:38 Let's see what his excuse is
01:30:40 Go!
01:31:06 What's the quickest way to lose my virginity?
01:31:08 How do I execute Operation Pump and Dump?
01:31:10 Also, am I a bad person?
01:31:12 Yes
01:31:14 Zan, could you not hear that?
01:31:16 I didn't hear, I only heard him say hello
01:31:18 and I was making jokes about that being like his opening line
01:31:20 That's weird
01:31:22 I heard the whole thing
01:31:24 No, the sound was down
01:31:26 on the rhythm
01:31:28 Oh, okay, point was
01:31:30 Okay, Mage immediately
01:31:32 says to this guy that he is a
01:31:34 bad person because he just wants to pump and dump
01:31:36 There's nothing wrong
01:31:38 with going to pump and dump
01:31:40 It was mostly a joke, if both are concerning
01:31:42 to the act of pumping
01:31:44 No, of course
01:31:46 Listen to this fucking boomer
01:31:48 with consent
01:31:50 It's over man, get out of here
01:31:52 Post Consent Society
01:31:54 We're posting everything
01:31:56 Ban
01:31:58 Well, okay, listen
01:32:00 So the gist was, he has a girlfriend
01:32:02 Did you notice
01:32:04 he said something in there that was like
01:32:06 I won't be able to have a girlfriend
01:32:08 like in a year
01:32:10 What does that mean?
01:32:12 Maybe he's going to the military
01:32:14 Was I not paying attention?
01:32:16 No, you were not
01:32:18 He has a girlfriend, why doesn't he just fuck her?
01:32:22 I think
01:32:24 that's what he needs help with
01:32:26 Look, I've been there, you have a girlfriend
01:32:28 and you want to convert that girlfriend into
01:32:30 a girlfriend, but you are inexperienced
01:32:32 and you don't know how
01:32:34 The good news is
01:32:36 your hard work is behind you
01:32:38 You've got plenty of months, what you want to do
01:32:40 is in a non-creepy way, a totally nice way
01:32:42 You want to escalate physical intimacy
01:32:44 like hand touching
01:32:46 You just say, hey, I want to have sex
01:32:48 and if she says no, then you just leave
01:32:50 because you want sex
01:32:52 Ben's point is actually correct
01:32:56 Don't fall into the trap, I literally did this
01:32:58 You're absolutely right
01:33:00 You know what Ben? Rare moment
01:33:02 Ben's correct
01:33:04 I did it
01:33:06 If you have a girlfriend
01:33:08 and you want to have sex
01:33:10 and she doesn't want to
01:33:12 and that's it
01:33:14 You shouldn't be dating
01:33:16 Because that's such a large component
01:33:18 of the relationship
01:33:20 If you can't talk past it
01:33:22 If you're 13
01:33:24 whatever, if you want to fuck at 13
01:33:26 like a 16 year old
01:33:28 who's ready to go
01:33:30 who's experienced
01:33:32 or a 13 year old
01:33:34 I don't care, whatever
01:33:36 Don't encourage what?
01:33:38 Underage
01:33:40 I'm encouraging it
01:33:42 There's nothing illegal about that
01:33:44 No, nothing
01:33:46 Well, there might be a legal in some states
01:33:48 a 13 year old to fuck a 16 year old
01:33:50 because the divide between them
01:33:52 I mean 13's kind of young
01:33:54 I don't think it's illegal
01:33:56 Well, the premise there was a 13 year old
01:33:58 horn dog who wants to fuck
01:34:00 I mean, what are we going to say?
01:34:02 They're not allowed to?
01:34:04 I don't think it's not allowed
01:34:06 They can fight a 13 year old
01:34:08 As a general statement
01:34:10 not pointed to anybody
01:34:12 Practice sex
01:34:14 Condoms and whatnot
01:34:16 Do that too
01:34:18 Good advice
01:34:20 I'll go one step further on that
01:34:22 I actually am not
01:34:24 In my days
01:34:26 I've become a little bit revised on this point
01:34:28 I don't think having rampant sex
01:34:30 is really like a great way to live your life
01:34:32 I think pursuing people
01:34:34 who have a fellow interest in sex
01:34:36 who you could like have some kind of
01:34:38 reasonable relationship with
01:34:40 I just think will make you happier long term
01:34:42 having tried both
01:34:44 But get out there and meet someone who wants to have sex
01:34:46 as you do
01:34:48 and maybe your girlfriend does
01:34:50 You can't be pussyfoot around
01:34:52 She wants to have sex, just know if you
01:34:56 We're kind of scared of the actual question
01:34:58 His actual question is how does he lose
01:35:00 his virginity as quickly as possible
01:35:02 And I say that
01:35:04 I say that one
01:35:06 I mean, tell your girlfriend
01:35:08 you want to do that
01:35:10 There's a sunset on this relationship
01:35:12 And if she says no then pursue plan B
01:35:14 which is
01:35:16 get rid of her
01:35:18 I don't know
01:35:20 Ask around
01:35:22 Anyone for sex please
01:35:26 Use the Christian method
01:35:28 and bring a sign to school that says
01:35:30 Hello, my name is
01:35:32 whatever my name is, I'm looking for
01:35:34 such and such age female
01:35:36 so on and so forth
01:35:38 My name is I Need to Get Laid Now
01:35:40 as featured on the Procrastinator's podcast
01:35:42 with a link
01:35:44 Dude, how to get laid
01:35:46 Just tell them you were featured on the PCP
01:35:48 and their panties will hit the floor
01:35:50 Trust me
01:35:52 He already tried just being cool
01:35:54 and that's how he got his girlfriend
01:35:56 Now that you've been featured on the show
01:35:58 It doesn't surprise me at all
01:36:00 to hear him say that just calling himself cool
01:36:02 actually works
01:36:04 because that's just how simple human minds are
01:36:06 If you hear someone being called cool
01:36:08 even if it's themself
01:36:10 you will just learn the association
01:36:12 Oh, that cool guy
01:36:14 I've heard of this before
01:36:16 It's just that easy
01:36:20 Alright, there you go
01:36:22 There's your one-step program
01:36:24 Transparency is so important for our relationship
01:36:26 You just gotta be straightforward
01:36:28 I'll just tell the short tale again
01:36:30 of like I had a girlfriend in college
01:36:32 I wanted to fuck
01:36:34 It's obvious I was a loser and she wasn't into me
01:36:36 but like she pitied ATV basically
01:36:38 Yeah, exactly
01:36:40 but like, you know, would like try to push for that
01:36:42 and she would recoil because she wasn't into me
01:36:44 I don't blame her at all, 100% on me
01:36:46 So you know what you do?
01:36:48 And the relationship, if you're not into each other
01:36:50 and you move on, that's all there is to it
01:36:52 That's all there is to it
01:36:54 Alright, next voicemail
01:36:56 Here we go, we got the Northern Norway report
01:36:58 Okay, sick, go
01:37:00 Okay, so I listened to this previous episode
01:37:02 of the PCP a couple of weeks ago
01:37:04 and there was this voicemail with a guy
01:37:06 reporting on the autumn
01:37:08 and I start getting fucking pissed
01:37:10 because they look all around me
01:37:12 and there's snow
01:37:14 and there's winter
01:37:16 and he said he's gonna call back
01:37:18 three weeks, three months
01:37:20 Winter report
01:37:22 No, no, it's already winter here
01:37:24 Get your facts straight, you fucking retard
01:37:28 Also, related question
01:37:30 I woke up and there were some moose
01:37:32 shitting in my garden
01:37:36 and I got really scared
01:37:38 I waited until they got away
01:37:40 before I got out of the house
01:37:42 to go to school and stuff
01:37:44 So I have a question
01:37:46 Have any of you experienced
01:37:48 a similar incident?
01:37:50 Has a moose ever shitting
01:37:52 your garden back?
01:37:54 They have moose in Norway?
01:37:56 I'm trying to think
01:37:58 I thought those were North American
01:38:00 Landbridge?
01:38:02 I don't know
01:38:04 He said he was from Norway, right?
01:38:06 Yeah, Norway
01:38:10 I mean, I've seen a moose
01:38:12 when we went to Maine
01:38:14 I remember we saw some moose
01:38:16 Moose are fucking huge
01:38:18 by the way, moose are like
01:38:20 Do you guys know how big moose are?
01:38:22 They're huge
01:38:24 They're like fucking tanks
01:38:26 He's definitely right saying in the house
01:38:28 They could easily crush you
01:38:30 A horse
01:38:32 You see a horse in person
01:38:34 and you think, oh my god
01:38:36 I didn't realize just how big
01:38:38 a horse really is
01:38:40 and then you see a moose
01:38:42 and it makes the horse look like nothing
01:38:44 Okay
01:38:46 I thought they were a North American thing
01:38:48 but I'm not
01:38:50 too shocked to find out that I'm wrong
01:38:52 Anyway, they went over that damn landbridge
01:38:54 I used to see deer a lot
01:38:56 in college
01:38:58 because it was in a forest
01:39:00 that had a lot of deer around
01:39:02 and it should up its gamer cred
01:39:04 by ditching the leaf and making a moose
01:39:06 They're like national symbol or something
01:39:08 because moose are fucking sick
01:39:10 and they've got dope antlers
01:39:12 and they could easily crush a man
01:39:14 Do that
01:39:16 That's my recommendation
01:39:18 You ever read the Blue Moose stories
01:39:20 by Daniel Pinkwater?
01:39:22 Of course I did
01:39:24 Absolutely
01:39:26 For anyone who doesn't know, Daniel Pinkwater
01:39:28 was like a young adult fiction
01:39:30 I guess when we were kids
01:39:32 I don't know
01:39:34 That helped me out
01:39:36 That moose would eat and drink
01:39:38 one very specific thing
01:39:40 Was it like cinnamon?
01:39:42 Was it cider and chowder or something?
01:39:44 I just remember
01:39:46 the lodge that the Blue Moose
01:39:48 would visit
01:39:50 was known for
01:39:52 legendary chowder
01:39:54 That was their specialty
01:39:56 I don't even remember
01:39:58 anything that happened
01:40:00 I just remember there was a Blue Moose
01:40:02 who would hang out with his dude
01:40:04 at his fucking lodge in Maine
01:40:06 and they would eat chowder
01:40:08 and just fucking shoot the shit
01:40:10 by Stephen King
01:40:12 No, Daniel Pinkwater
01:40:14 Legendary
01:40:16 Let's go on to the next one
01:40:18 How many more?
01:40:20 18 more
01:40:22 We've got one
01:40:24 but this is good
01:40:26 It's Art Boy towards Chile
01:40:28 He's not dead yet
01:40:30 Maybe by the time you hear this
01:40:32 For anyone who doesn't know, the reason we're saying that
01:40:34 I'll make sure of it
01:40:36 The reason we're saying that is because he is from Chile
01:40:38 which is undergoing some kind of
01:40:40 fucking riot storm
01:40:42 Call it a revolution
01:40:44 It's all about the optics, Ben
01:40:46 It's a revolution
01:40:48 A workers revolt
01:40:50 I'm honestly not 100% clear
01:40:52 Oh, it's a litany of stuff
01:40:54 It seems like
01:40:56 I know corruption is a thing
01:40:58 They raised the price on public transport
01:41:00 but there was a lot more
01:41:02 that had happened before that
01:41:04 that had led up to this happening
01:41:06 Anyway, we should...
01:41:08 But also he had some health issues
01:41:10 Nexus continually
01:41:12 draws
01:41:14 This is so embarrassing that
01:41:16 there are men like Nexus out there
01:41:18 make me feel ashamed of myself
01:41:20 He just goes and he draws
01:41:22 and drops and just goes to the hospital
01:41:24 I don't know if that's something
01:41:26 to be proud of, honestly
01:41:28 Well, is it better
01:41:30 to burn out as a bright star
01:41:32 to slowly fade away into the
01:41:34 Why not
01:41:36 follow the middle way?
01:41:38 Don't burn out, just burn longer
01:41:40 The middle way is for pussies
01:41:42 Let's hear what Nexus has to say
01:41:44 Here you go
01:41:46 Oh, fuck
01:41:48 Hey, PCB
01:41:50 Nexus here from Chile
01:41:52 What a wig, man
01:41:54 Thing is, I found
01:41:56 a very sexy poster
01:41:58 I drew for the Ratcon Arena 3
01:42:00 that features Monty,
01:42:02 Egyptbro, Best Guy Ever, Tom Oliver
01:42:04 Give and Take
01:42:06 and that guy from the Kickstarter
01:42:08 So, I've been wondering
01:42:10 which one of you guys
01:42:12 would like to have the original art
01:42:14 of that poster in particular
01:42:16 There's a new post office downstairs
01:42:18 even in the middle of the chaos
01:42:20 in the city right now, so let me know
01:42:22 Oh, and by the way
01:42:24 this is a present, meaning
01:42:26 it's free
01:42:28 Oh fuck, no
01:42:30 I didn't say freedom, I said free
01:42:32 Oh, no way
01:42:34 That's even worse
01:42:38 Oh
01:42:40 So, okay
01:42:42 I think it's only fair that me,
01:42:44 an original member of the podcast gets that poster
01:42:46 Yeah, that's fair
01:42:48 I think as part of his severance package
01:42:50 we actually owe it to Mumkey
01:42:52 Um, so
01:42:54 I think this was somewhere
01:42:56 in the contract
01:42:58 Hey, remember all those good times we had without you
01:43:00 Here's a reminder, put it on your wall
01:43:02 Rest in peace, Mumkey
01:43:04 Oh my god
01:43:06 Listen, listen, listen
01:43:08 I have a PL box, you know the address, Nexus
01:43:10 Send it to me, I want it
01:43:12 I want it, I would appreciate it more
01:43:14 I bet it smells like ink
01:43:16 It probably does
01:43:18 You know, maybe we could in some way
01:43:20 have some sort of game of
01:43:22 Yeah, maybe no, cut it into 8 pieces
01:43:24 and send it to each of us
01:43:26 Damn, that's a good idea
01:43:28 When we all
01:43:30 like, unite, then we can
01:43:32 see the full image
01:43:34 Honestly, yeah, and then like we have
01:43:36 like at Radcon 4, we all come together
01:43:38 and like put it together like that
01:43:40 Ooh, that would be sweet
01:43:42 But Mage would have to get off her dumb ass
01:43:44 and get over to North America
01:43:46 No, you go, you come to England
01:43:48 Mage, how much money would it take
01:43:50 to get you to come for Radcon
01:43:52 Yeah, give us enough
01:43:54 Okay, Mage, that's 100%
01:43:56 Not only
01:43:58 How about 9,000 Nigerian dollars?
01:44:02 Mage, listen, listen
01:44:04 Let's just say theoretically
01:44:06 your entire trip was paid for
01:44:08 and let's just say for a crazy bonus
01:44:10 you also will get paid
01:44:12 $1,000, I'm keeping it trying
01:44:14 to be reasonable here
01:44:16 I'm just saying
01:44:18 Just an exaggeration, would you
01:44:20 come with that situation?
01:44:22 It's not about the price, having
01:44:24 the journey
01:44:26 Is it the bother of having to take the trip
01:44:28 and the babbling and all that?
01:44:30 I'm scared of traveling alone to America
01:44:32 America scares me, can you blame me?
01:44:34 Oh, it's always right to settle down
01:44:36 reasonably well at this point
01:44:38 I have a country with guns
01:44:40 I'm scared
01:44:42 Where's carrying guns around?
01:44:44 Here's the thing
01:44:46 You wouldn't be coming to the
01:44:48 gun part of America, you'd be coming to
01:44:50 Massachusetts, which is like as European
01:44:52 as America gets
01:44:54 Everyone wearing
01:44:56 scary cowboy hats
01:44:58 and guns all over the world
01:45:00 That's like the Ontario
01:45:02 That's like the Ontario
01:45:04 of the United States, it's like its own
01:45:06 Ontario? Yeah, it's like a separate part
01:45:08 No one gets these Canada
01:45:10 metaphors you're using, no one understands anything about Canada
01:45:12 No, not Ontario, Quebec
01:45:14 Quebec is sort of its own cultural enclave
01:45:16 in Canada, I think
01:45:18 because they have a French peaking part
01:45:20 Texas is its own fucking beast
01:45:22 Massachusetts is the good part
01:45:24 I don't want to go to Virginia, fuck Virginia
01:45:26 We'll keep you posted
01:45:28 I got an observation to make
01:45:30 I got an observation to make about America
01:45:32 Mage, maybe you should be afraid
01:45:34 Listen, my personal life
01:45:36 I realized this the other day
01:45:38 my personal life has been kind of shit
01:45:40 ever since Trump got elected
01:45:42 and I can't find
01:45:44 a direct causal link
01:45:46 but it can't be coincidence
01:45:48 It has to be a connection, I know it
01:45:50 I know it in my heart
01:45:52 Ooh, when you got that
01:45:54 Trump derangement syndrome
01:45:56 it's tough to relate to your fellow man
01:45:58 Wait, what is that?
01:46:00 Well, that is the thing
01:46:02 You attribute everything
01:46:04 to what will happen to you at the Trump
01:46:06 When you're just so steam
01:46:08 that Orange Man is so bad
01:46:10 Is that a real thing? Is that like a phrase?
01:46:12 I mean, it's like a brain phrase
01:46:14 It's used to own the lives
01:46:16 Well, I better
01:46:18 I guess it's me
01:46:20 No, it's not me
01:46:22 That's victim blaming
01:46:24 It's not my fault for being mad
01:46:26 It's his fault for being bad and making me upset
01:46:28 That's fair
01:46:30 In addition to
01:46:32 being scared of Trump
01:46:34 In addition to Orange Man, yes
01:46:36 It's also like
01:46:38 I tend to fall ill
01:46:40 immediately after I travel
01:46:42 so I kind of don't want to be ill
01:46:44 in a foreign country
01:46:46 Have I talked about
01:46:48 what happened to me right before I left
01:46:50 to go to BronyCon this past year?
01:46:52 Much like Hillary Clinton
01:46:54 you have not yet told us what happened
01:46:56 Please do so
01:46:58 Again, okay
01:47:00 Before I travel
01:47:02 I'm kind of a homebody as well
01:47:04 Before I travel
01:47:06 I get very nervous
01:47:08 I get very anxious
01:47:10 and this was happening to me
01:47:12 I couldn't sleep, I was pacing around
01:47:14 in my house, I was sweating
01:47:16 I was sweating a lot
01:47:18 I don't know, that just happens
01:47:20 Something that I do a lot
01:47:22 when I'm stressed out is I'll cut my hair
01:47:24 or I'll groom a lot
01:47:26 a whole bunch of times or whatever
01:47:28 I'll take a bunch of showers
01:47:30 So this time
01:47:32 I'm looking at myself and I'm brushing my teeth
01:47:34 and I'm looking at my teeth and I'm like
01:47:36 Ah, damn these teeth
01:47:38 and I've got like
01:47:40 Damn these teeth
01:47:42 Get them out of my mouth now
01:47:46 No, I've got this tooth whitening gel
01:47:48 It comes in like a thing
01:47:50 So I might as well whiten my teeth
01:47:52 So I put this shit on my teeth
01:47:54 and I put it in my mouth
01:47:56 and I'm looking in
01:47:58 and the stick gets on my gums
01:48:00 and I have used it before
01:48:02 and it has gotten on my gums before
01:48:04 and it's been fine, like it has not been a problem
01:48:06 but this time it gets on my gums
01:48:08 and a little piece of my gums
01:48:10 just turns like chalk white
01:48:12 bone white, like swollen
01:48:14 weird looking, looks like cooked chicken
01:48:16 whiter than my teeth
01:48:18 it's just a little piece of my skin
01:48:20 it just turns white, I'm like oh my god
01:48:22 I start like, I go in to have a little fucking
01:48:24 attack, I have a little panic attack
01:48:26 about it, I get like
01:48:28 just distraught, I get emotionally distraught
01:48:30 I'm like weeping, right
01:48:32 I'm like, I'm rinsing my mouth out
01:48:34 like a whole bunch of it, after a little while
01:48:36 after a little while
01:48:38 it starts to go down, it just starts kind of
01:48:40 just turns kind of sore, but it goes away
01:48:42 and I'm like oh thank god, I thought I was doomed
01:48:44 I thought I was just doomed to have fucking chicken mouth
01:48:46 for the rest of my life
01:48:48 but for that moment
01:48:50 I was like, I can't go, I can't leave the house
01:48:52 like this, I'm a freak, I'm a freak
01:48:54 well
01:48:56 what was the point of that story?
01:48:58 I can't remember
01:49:00 oh traveling, traveling, fear, before traveling
01:49:02 or something, I've been using the crest white strips
01:49:04 a little bit, I've been a little lazy
01:49:06 I'm gonna try to use them like every other day or something
01:49:08 they seem, they're not bad
01:49:10 I haven't used my, that's the same kind of
01:49:12 I haven't used my, that whitening gel
01:49:14 since this happened, I'm too scared to try again
01:49:16 I don't want to have a chicken
01:49:18 it was very weird looking
01:49:20 and I've never, it was like
01:49:22 yeah, it was fucking scary, it was like
01:49:24 body hard
01:49:26 no, I'm sure, yeah
01:49:28 fucking yikes
01:49:30 well on this subject
01:49:32 perhaps one day
01:49:34 I wonder how much it would really cost us
01:49:36 to do like a rad con
01:49:38 in England
01:49:40 in London England, jolly old England
01:49:42 I mean considering you and
01:49:44 Gib and Mage wouldn't have to fly
01:49:46 but then like, you know, five or six
01:49:48 or seven or whatever of us would have to fly
01:49:50 so that's gonna be a pretty penny
01:49:52 but I don't know, I mean realistically
01:49:54 it would be me, you,
01:49:56 Munchy, Digi
01:49:58 Jesse, if he went
01:50:00 if he went, yeah
01:50:02 well is Tom just not coming
01:50:04 oh and Tom, well Tom definitely could
01:50:06 but I can't remember everybody
01:50:08 wait, that's like six people?
01:50:10 let's say six people, yeah it seems about right
01:50:12 assuming Jesse goes
01:50:14 I mean that right there, I don't know
01:50:16 I could easily imagine that would be like ten grand
01:50:18 ten grand? no
01:50:20 yeah, it's gotta be over a thousand dollars
01:50:22 for people to fly to England from Merrick
01:50:24 yeah, no, maybe you're right, yeah it could be
01:50:26 are the tickets really that bad?
01:50:28 no
01:50:30 you know what, we could research this
01:50:32 I think it's usually able to fly for less
01:50:34 we could get them for better
01:50:36 we could probably get around-trip tickets
01:50:38 for under a grand for each person
01:50:40 I'm seeing costs for like
01:50:42 I'm seeing costs for like six hundred
01:50:44 for round-trip?
01:50:46 for one person? oh not round-trip, my bad
01:50:48 maybe it is, I don't know
01:50:50 let me check
01:50:52 round-trip, yeah, yeah
01:50:54 round-trip, 633
01:50:56 okay
01:50:58 alright, hey, you know, that's not terrible
01:51:00 I mean still, for six people that ends up being like
01:51:02 that would be a large percentage of the budget
01:51:04 what airport would you guys use?
01:51:06 I don't know, Mage
01:51:08 I'm no London expert
01:51:10 no, no, no, I'm asking the American
01:51:12 which one you would use
01:51:14 wait, I have a lot of CVG
01:51:16 we don't need to go through the numbers right now
01:51:18 but you can use CVG
01:51:20 which airport I'd fly out of
01:51:22 to England
01:51:24 I would fly out of
01:51:26 it's Cincinnati
01:51:30 yeah, Logan Airport
01:51:32 she's probably going to crunch the
01:51:34 numbers right now
01:51:36 I'm trying to, yeah, just like, how do you spell Cincinnati?
01:51:38 we can do this later
01:51:40 we've got approximate numbers
01:51:42 if we raised, let's just say theoretically
01:51:44 if we raised like $10,000 for a ride
01:51:46 that's a pretty penny
01:51:48 but I think it's theoretically possible
01:51:50 for like a PCP in England or whatever
01:51:52 the things we'd want would be
01:51:54 air flight and then like
01:51:56 we'd need some sort of sort of like Airbnb
01:51:58 or some place to live while we're there
01:52:00 would $10,000 cover it?
01:52:02 probably, I think so
01:52:04 probably cover it
01:52:06 we probably also want Vic to be
01:52:08 cameraman too, that's another
01:52:10 expense as well
01:52:12 but I don't know, whatever
01:52:14 we'd have to fly Vic out and all his equipment
01:52:16 and his equipment too
01:52:18 maybe we just hire somebody else
01:52:20 to do it locally, I don't know
01:52:22 might make sense
01:52:24 you'd also have to make it worth his while
01:52:26 yeah, exactly
01:52:28 we also paid him last time
01:52:30 ideally, we're spending time doing this
01:52:32 I would like to get paid
01:52:34 I would like to at least not lose money
01:52:36 on the venture, that would be nice
01:52:38 which we have each time, but
01:52:40 I don't know, whatever, we'll see what happens
01:52:42 I, Radcom 4 man
01:52:44 Radcom 4
01:52:46 the Sonichi Lecture 2
01:52:48 is going to be a defining moment
01:52:50 I am like
01:52:52 I'm like
01:52:54 I'm creating history
01:52:56 right now
01:52:58 so that I can deliver it in
01:53:00 that's the way to do it, that's what God did
01:53:02 so that I can deliver it in
01:53:04 Sonichi Lecture 102
01:53:06 beautiful
01:53:08 this is what it's all about
01:53:10 speaking of lectures, this just reminds me
01:53:12 of a point I was going to say before
01:53:14 I avoided talking about this for a long time
01:53:16 because it actually bothered me and grossed me out
01:53:18 and I didn't like it
01:53:20 and it gave me lots of anxiety
01:53:22 so the final fantasy lecture
01:53:24 I did at Radcom 3
01:53:26 there's a bunch of issues with it
01:53:28 audio-wise, which is very unfortunate
01:53:30 it wasn't perfect, it wasn't good as the Kingdom Hearts one
01:53:32 that's fine, doesn't matter
01:53:34 but the main thing I had about that
01:53:36 I was very sad that the audio was dorked in the way it was
01:53:38 aside from that
01:53:40 I was very, very
01:53:42 worried, I was considering just scrapping the entire
01:53:44 video for one reason
01:53:46 and it was that
01:53:48 my, I had just shaved
01:53:50 before doing it, I was very concerned about
01:53:52 looking decent
01:53:54 I had just shaved and I was like
01:53:56 bleeding a little bit
01:53:58 I was like, you guys were downstairs
01:54:00 waiting for me and I'm upstairs
01:54:02 I had just shaved, I'm like, oh god
01:54:04 I'm bleeding, it's so gross
01:54:06 I don't want anyone to see it, it's so nasty
01:54:08 I hate it
01:54:10 you should have seen, as I was editing the video
01:54:12 Michelle was like, Nate, shut the fuck, no one cares
01:54:14 Nate, just post the video
01:54:16 you can't even see it
01:54:18 and if you look real close, you may be able to
01:54:20 detect some slight traces
01:54:22 but basically no one can tell
01:54:24 I mean, not one person
01:54:26 complaining about that, but like
01:54:28 me at fucking Radcon 3
01:54:30 Fat Ben, of course
01:54:32 Fat Ben, unshaven Ben
01:54:34 like, just like
01:54:36 not decrepit, but like
01:54:38 just like disheveled
01:54:40 disheveled, terrible
01:54:42 worst Ben
01:54:44 man, oh, I look so fucking
01:54:46 I look so fucking bad at Radcon 3
01:54:48 I'm on camera basically every week now
01:54:50 for Reagolas, but the real milestones
01:54:52 I want to get fit and get
01:54:54 better in shape and whatnot
01:54:56 so that for the next lecture, you know, the videos people actually care about
01:54:58 it'll be a look
01:55:00 a look that much better
01:55:02 we were doing voicemails
01:55:04 you're right, you're right
01:55:06 and let's get back to it and wrap this pony up
01:55:08 alright, this is
01:55:10 okay, watch out, brace yourself
01:55:12 this is an extremely scary voicemail
01:55:14 warning, ultra haunted
01:55:16 okay, so let's, it is the Halloween season
01:55:18 this will be like one day after Halloween
01:55:20 but nonetheless, okay, brace yourselves
01:55:22 so you're with your honey
01:55:24 and you're making out when
01:55:26 the phone rings
01:55:28 you answer it and the
01:55:30 voice is, what are
01:55:32 you doing with my daughter
01:55:36 you tell your girl and she
01:55:38 say, my dad is
01:55:40 dead
01:55:42 then who
01:55:44 was
01:55:46 phone
01:55:52 phone was daddy
01:55:54 daddy isn't her father
01:55:56 daddy is
01:55:58 the joke is well known
01:56:00 the joke isn't done, but
01:56:02 the production value was
01:56:04 worth the play
01:56:06 there's something you're misunderstanding here
01:56:10 a phone, a dad
01:56:12 is phone
01:56:14 I'm daddy
01:56:16 not father
01:56:18 yes, exactly
01:56:20 this is some new John Tron level
01:56:22 shit, I don't care about production value
01:56:24 next, next
01:56:26 alright, next voicemail, here we go
01:56:28 this is from the leader of the
01:56:30 PC partisans
01:56:32 okay, alright, good, go
01:56:34 greetings, PCP, this mission
01:56:36 if you choose to accept it
01:56:38 may very well change the entire world
01:56:40 around you, it's coming to my
01:56:42 attention, you're now all under house
01:56:44 arrest by the PC police
01:56:46 and may be subjected to gay
01:56:48 rape, straight rape
01:56:50 and even worse
01:56:52 but we, the PC partisans can fix that
01:56:54 we're leading a revolution
01:56:56 to stop them and need your help
01:56:58 the first 9-11 was so successful
01:57:00 they're planning a sequel, 7-11
01:57:02 we're on July 11th
01:57:04 2020, 11, 7-11
01:57:06 convenience stores, we're throwing
01:57:08 their 7 important towers by Nazi
01:57:10 vampires, hate off by the PC
01:57:12 police and their martial masters
01:57:14 this inside
01:57:16 job will be leveraged to give full power
01:57:18 to the Dark Lord and spell
01:57:20 the end for America
01:57:22 we can break you out
01:57:24 but if you do, you need to help us
01:57:26 I'll wait your response
01:57:28 but I NEED TO GO
01:57:30 what do you think?
01:57:32 oh man, man, is that guy in chili with nexus?
01:57:34 yeah, a lot of gunshots today
01:57:36 I mean, okay
01:57:38 I don't, you know
01:57:40 I wasn't gonna do anything
01:57:42 about the house arrest situation
01:57:44 but 7-11
01:57:46 I'm just so charmed by the theming
01:57:48 of this terrorist attack that I can't help
01:57:50 but get on board with it
01:57:52 you know, there was Homestuck
01:57:54 there was Homestuck 2
01:57:56 there was 9-11, then there was 7-11
01:57:58 and the rest was history
01:58:00 equally good works of art
01:58:02 okay, next one
01:58:04 we're in
01:58:06 we're in, we're fully on board
01:58:08 I'm comfortable speaking for the rest of us
01:58:10 that we will all die for this cause
01:58:12 no
01:58:14 no, no, your protests are in vain
01:58:16 I mean, I'm
01:58:18 putting distance between myself and this
01:58:20 concept
01:58:22 alright, next up, put mage on the front lines
01:58:24 strap mage to the front of the plane
01:58:26 I'm not gonna be there, I won't be there
01:58:28 alright, I think what he said
01:58:30 what am I gonna do?
01:58:32 we're gonna drive 7-7-11s
01:58:34 into
01:58:36 Nazi vampires
01:58:38 how are you gonna drive a 7-11?
01:58:40 I think we're going to
01:58:42 bomb 7-7-11s
01:58:44 on
01:58:46 I don't remember how the Nazi vampires
01:58:48 come into it
01:58:50 that's where I get my big gulps
01:58:52 I'm not bombing a 7-11
01:58:54 you can't make an egg with that
01:58:56 break into an obelisk
01:58:58 we'll go in
01:59:00 I'll buy up their entire stock
01:59:02 of cheeseburger bites
01:59:04 and then you can do what you want with them
01:59:06 that makes sense
01:59:08 they don't even have the hot deals
01:59:10 they don't even have the hot deals on
01:59:12 rockstar ex-durance anymore
01:59:14 it used to be 2 for 3 dollars
01:59:16 an incredible bargain
01:59:18 now what do you got like 2 for 5 for quake
01:59:20 fuck quake
01:59:22 die
01:59:24 next voicemail
01:59:26 we've got rustles
01:59:28 sorry, it's rustle
01:59:30 with name something scarier than a ghost
01:59:32 with a gun
01:59:34 I think it's the rustle
01:59:36 I think so
01:59:38 what's up guys
01:59:40 it's your gangoy rustle here
01:59:42 just calling in to let you know that a few months ago
01:59:44 I lost the only virginity
01:59:46 that's actually worth a damn
01:59:48 that's right
01:59:50 shooting a gun
01:59:52 a staccato p9mm handgun to be exact
01:59:54 so I just wanted to ask
01:59:56 what kind of guns have you guys shot in the past
01:59:58 and if none
02:00:00 what kind of guns do you want to shoot
02:00:02 no guns
02:00:04 no guns
02:00:06 I have fired a gun
02:00:08 on a firing range before
02:00:10 like once
02:00:12 was it like a pistol
02:00:14 one of those
02:00:16 wait have I
02:00:18 I think I have
02:00:20 me this episode
02:00:22 I'm scared to go to America because of guns
02:00:24 every single voicemail
02:00:26 I don't like guns
02:00:28 I don't like guns either
02:00:30 I've shot one at a range before
02:00:32 but I'm honestly now
02:00:34 what about like Boy Scouts
02:00:36 with the scouts I must have done it at some point
02:00:38 really
02:00:40 you did
02:00:42 what was that
02:00:44 in school
02:00:46 we were like I think secondary grade
02:00:48 we went to a police station
02:00:50 you shot at the school mage
02:00:52 we went on a little
02:00:54 tour to a police station
02:00:56 we were allowed to shoot
02:00:58 that's crazy
02:01:00 here play with my gun
02:01:06 it's only filled with hollow points
02:01:08 apparently shooting a gun isn't as
02:01:10 uniquely experiential
02:01:12 as I thought
02:01:14 a lot of you guys are like just an hour counting that you
02:01:16 shot a gun
02:01:18 you a frequent shooter
02:01:20 no I've never shot a gun before in my life
02:01:22 but um
02:01:24 it's just like
02:01:26 it's the kind of thing you would definitely remember
02:01:28 right exactly
02:01:30 apparently not
02:01:32 I would have been like a decade or more ago
02:01:34 so I'm like
02:01:36 I'm like 85% sure
02:01:38 I've also been to archery
02:01:40 you're not even sure if you shot it
02:01:42 that's how vague it is
02:01:44 maybe with these fools
02:01:46 I remember absolutely explicitly shooting guns
02:01:48 I have shot these exact guns
02:01:50 I shot BB guns stuff
02:01:52 like at Boy Scouts for the rifle rearrange
02:01:54 whatever
02:01:56 I did the shotgun shooting merit badge
02:01:58 which I achieved as with the BB gun shooting one
02:02:00 or the rifle shooting
02:02:02 so I had my shotgun shooting merit badge
02:02:04 it was fucking sick it was the best time ever
02:02:06 we shot clay pigeons I was so fucking good at it
02:02:08 it was absolutely dopey shit
02:02:10 and actually just the other day
02:02:12 Michelle on Michelle's
02:02:14 interest in the subject
02:02:16 she was like maybe we should go shoot guns
02:02:18 I was like fuck yeah let's do that
02:02:20 she would want to shoot guns
02:02:22 there we're in Ohio now baby
02:02:24 it's a wild west
02:02:26 that's right
02:02:28 so we haven't shot yet what we did was
02:02:30 we went to the intro to firearms course
02:02:32 and we were gonna set up for like a class
02:02:34 where they teach you more stuff
02:02:36 and then you actually go shoot pistols and real guns
02:02:38 on a range and stuff so we'll probably do that sometime
02:02:40 and I'm
02:02:42 super fun it's fucking sick dude guns are dope
02:02:44 epic
02:02:46 I'm way into it although they do
02:02:48 terrify me and I don't want them around me
02:02:50 I don't know if it counts but like I remember
02:02:52 like dad had a BB gun and I remember
02:02:54 like shooting some cans with a BB gun
02:02:56 but I feel like remember that time dad shot
02:02:58 the fucking rabbit in the garden
02:03:00 that fucking rabbit that psychopath
02:03:02 what the fuck dad because it was just
02:03:04 you didn't think it
02:03:06 I similarly remember my dad coming home
02:03:08 one day he came home and it's like
02:03:10 the first time he shot a gun and he like he had
02:03:12 like the gun range like
02:03:14 little sheet where you shoot it and he's like
02:03:16 he hung it up in his office I was like okay cool
02:03:18 in his office he's just like shooting across the room
02:03:20 yeah you're real badass dad
02:03:22 no no no like he brought it
02:03:24 he brought home the sheet that he shot
02:03:26 oh okay yeah yeah
02:03:28 we did archery
02:03:30 okay I've definitely shot BB guns
02:03:32 I
02:03:34 think I don't remember
02:03:36 if I shot a real gun at a range I've been to a range
02:03:38 it might have been an archery range
02:03:40 I feel like
02:03:42 we understand you exist in a state of quantum
02:03:44 having shot a gun
02:03:46 like disturbed by the fact that I'm not 100%
02:03:48 sure on this question
02:03:50 just go pick up a gun and shoot it
02:03:52 and then put your questions to rest already
02:03:54 alright let's move on here
02:03:56 couple more we got um
02:03:58 okay crates with pancakes
02:04:00 hashtag free secho
02:04:02 uh okay
02:04:04 no he's literally under my boot
02:04:06 deal right now my foot is on top of secho's body
02:04:08 push it down
02:04:10 push him
02:04:12 squeeze him out
02:04:14 the rates of dog incarceration are
02:04:16 insane
02:04:18 alright let's hear what he has to say
02:04:20 hey crater here
02:04:22 and Nate I'm calling you out
02:04:24 I was with my wife yesterday
02:04:26 yeah I got a wife what of it
02:04:28 and I see a dog on the corner of my
02:04:30 eye
02:04:32 I got out of bed after fresh plow
02:04:34 to the front porch
02:04:36 and here comes secho rolling his fat
02:04:38 dog ass over here
02:04:40 so I said
02:04:42 help me it's Nate
02:04:44 he keeps giving me fuel
02:04:46 and he just keeps feeding me
02:04:48 and feeding me
02:04:50 and he just won't stop
02:04:52 Nate
02:04:54 I contacted animal control
02:04:56 and they're on their way right now
02:04:58 oh
02:05:00 I think that's them
02:05:02 by the way can we please get fan art
02:05:04 a vorporn of secho eating
02:05:06 Nate please
02:05:08 oh no
02:05:10 it has to be in the furriard style
02:05:12 it's the only way
02:05:14 the only way to stop eating
02:05:16 is to consume that
02:05:18 which gives the
02:05:20 forces you to consume I guess
02:05:22 I can just imagine Nate
02:05:24 a big bag
02:05:26 of liquid fuel
02:05:28 you just could dump it out into secho's bowl
02:05:30 just slather it all over the floor
02:05:32 we hook it up to an IV
02:05:34 so he can't even not eat
02:05:36 you and him subsisting
02:05:38 on the same weird mineral
02:05:40 I pour it into the trough
02:05:42 and we both stick our heads through our respective holes
02:05:44 and we just lap it up
02:05:46 that's how it goes
02:05:48 we've been reduced to animals in this society
02:05:50 let's go to the next voicemail
02:05:52 ghost of
02:05:54 voice
02:05:56 the ghost of bad voicemails
02:05:58 okay

02:07:00 there is
02:07:02 no point

02:07:06 bad voicemails
02:07:08 because you're in one
02:07:10 because you're in one
02:07:16 I was only pretending
02:07:18 to be an idiot
02:07:22 the twist ending
02:07:24 the ghost of bad voicemails
02:07:26 was no ghost at all
02:07:28 for he yet lives
02:07:30 he lives on in our hearts
02:07:32 this is a living breathing bad voicemail
02:07:34 before I take this very moment
02:07:38 alright well how many more do we got
02:07:40 that was good we got I think two more
02:07:42 two more okay here we go
02:07:44 we got another call from not even
02:07:46 clusterpunk can save me now

02:07:52 alright let's see what we got go
02:07:54 sir I'm sorry
02:07:56 don't want your damn excuses
02:07:58 I want best guy
02:08:00 ever's head
02:08:02 why didn't you illuminate him
02:08:04 there was an
02:08:06 unforeseen variable
02:08:08 we were attacked by a ferocious
02:08:10 frothing at the mouth giraffe
02:08:12 oozing with AIDS
02:08:14 he held back our main
02:08:16 a giraffe
02:08:18 a fucking giraffe held back
02:08:20 my main squadron
02:08:22 well not just a giraffe sir
02:08:24 there was also this rotom canine
02:08:26 that
02:08:30 any other pcp
02:08:32 members that you were successful in locating
02:08:34 well we're currently
02:08:36 researching this wacky place
02:08:38 called England for suspect hippo
02:08:40 after many failed attempts
02:08:42 at locating him in Africa
02:08:44 or any local zoos
02:08:46 we've also discovered through tireless research
02:08:48 that best guy ever has an older
02:08:50 brother named Ben St
02:08:52 we've never found the dumpsters in Boston
02:08:54 that Ben St can be living in
02:08:56 so it's only a matter of time before we dig him up
02:08:58 no I'm always on the move
02:09:00 very good
02:09:02 we may have had a misstep with that
02:09:04 ferocious giraffe and rotom dog
02:09:06 but soon
02:09:08 very soon they'll be making t-shirts
02:09:10 saying one of the reason why
02:09:12 the pcp are dying
02:09:14 oh no
02:09:16 what you gonna do
02:09:18 the pcp
02:09:20 the pcp
02:09:22 the pcp police closed its grip
02:09:24 more and more every day
02:09:26 it's just propaganda
02:09:28 I'm not worried about it
02:09:30 they'll never find me
02:09:32 I'm slippery
02:09:34 literally like I'm covered in grease
02:09:36 yes absolutely
02:09:38 you are slime
02:09:40 oh so that's why you degreased the pizzas
02:09:42 to put it on yourself
02:09:44 I eat so much pizza grease
02:09:46 I sweat it now
02:09:48 we call it grease
02:09:50 first cousin of slime
02:09:52 it's related to ooze
02:09:54 and slime and sludge
02:09:56 you know I was actually curious
02:09:58 I don't know if you addressed this
02:10:00 was he dying that looked like a friolator
02:10:02 full of grease
02:10:04 no it is a chemical vat
02:10:06 this has been canon since the beginning
02:10:08 of slime oids
02:10:10 the way to kill a slime oid
02:10:12 is to throw it into a dissolution vat
02:10:14 oh I see
02:10:16 fair enough
02:10:18 now you can have multiple slime oids
02:10:20 in bottles
02:10:22 but before if you wanted a new slime oid
02:10:24 you had to go to the labs
02:10:26 and dissolve your old one
02:10:28 oh so this bottle thing that
02:10:30 is actually that's like lore
02:10:32 that was in there already
02:10:34 I had no idea
02:10:36 bottling slime oids is how you
02:10:38 I think you can have like three
02:10:40 pokeballs
02:10:42 in bottles
02:10:44 that's it
02:10:46 next voicemail here we go
02:10:48 we got fave chip
02:10:50 fave chip calling in go
02:10:52 question for y'all
02:10:54 do you guys have a
02:10:56 favorite
02:10:58 chip

02:11:02 that's the whole voicemail
02:11:04 I gotta tell you this was voicemail god
02:11:06 he had so many voicemails once again
02:11:08 I didn't play this out of pity
02:11:10 I like chips and I did want to talk about
02:11:12 my favorite chip
02:11:14 but he has so many voicemails
02:11:16 relax dude, relax
02:11:18 just make them on average better
02:11:20 what's your answer
02:11:22 what's your favorite chip
02:11:24 I think
02:11:26 I like
02:11:28 what are they called like new england style
02:11:30 like the really crunchy
02:11:32 cape cod chips
02:11:34 cape cod potato chips
02:11:36 I think those are my favorite
02:11:38 it's like you're breaking someone's spine
02:11:40 in your mouth
02:11:42 Tom sound familiar
02:11:44 it's great
02:11:46 yeah no I love those
02:11:48 you ever had
02:11:50 there's like a certain brand of potato chip
02:11:52 they come in a black bag
02:11:54 they look gourmet
02:11:56 and they have one kind that is like blue potato chips
02:11:58 made out of blue potatoes
02:12:00 and they have another kind
02:12:02 they have another kind that is like
02:12:04 it's like a mix of like
02:12:06 taro root and sweet potato
02:12:08 and like two other like different tubers
02:12:10 and they have chips at all
02:12:12 those are super good too
02:12:14 I really like those
02:12:16 I think I've had them but
02:12:18 mage, zen, comments
02:12:20 yeah
02:12:22 the thing that first comes to my mind is like
02:12:24 well I was listening
02:12:26 to this song by this rapper named young i may
02:12:28 and she's awesome gotta check her out
02:12:30 and she has this line in her newest song
02:12:32 she says pinky ring out the puddle
02:12:34 hot sauce under ruffles
02:12:36 and I was thinking
02:12:38 god that must be pretty tight
02:12:40 you know for you to mention
02:12:42 it in a song that must be pretty good
02:12:44 cause I like ruffles never had hot sauce on
02:12:46 indeed I might try it out
02:12:48 she's just shouting out ruffled potatoes
02:12:50 yep that's it
02:12:52 I feel like
02:12:54 I don't, I think I'm against
02:12:56 ruffles in principle
02:12:58 I kind of think they're overhyped
02:13:00 really what
02:13:02 they don't get that much acclaim
02:13:04 you see it on the bag
02:13:06 and it's like ooh ruffles
02:13:08 it's like a
02:13:10 point of sale it's like a selling
02:13:12 point and I'm like I just don't, I don't get it
02:13:14 oh you mean like the actual ridges on them
02:13:16 yeah
02:13:18 I like that texture
02:13:20 it's fine I don't know whatever it's a lateral move
02:13:22 I feel like it's a lateral move that gets overhyped
02:13:24 I
02:13:26 I usually like sour cream and onion
02:13:28 that's pretty basic I also like
02:13:30 um barbecue Pringles
02:13:32 yeah
02:13:34 but there was this one
02:13:36 I used in Latina and never again
02:13:38 because I could never find them again
02:13:40 they just disappeared off of the face of the earth
02:13:42 I don't remember what flavor they were
02:13:44 but like they were absolutely perfect
02:13:46 they were like sweet a little bit spicy
02:13:48 but not too spicy because I don't like too spicy
02:13:50 but a little bit of spice just a little bit
02:13:52 to get the little kid but they were sweet
02:13:54 and I just like when I ate them I just
02:13:56 I couldn't stop they were just so delicious
02:13:58 they were really next day to get more
02:14:00 because I just I wanted to know what flavor
02:14:02 it was to just like to just to get more
02:14:04 of it and they were gone and and like
02:14:06 what for as long as I was in Latina
02:14:08 this year they never again
02:14:10 stopped those chips wait what brand
02:14:12 what brand was it
02:14:14 I don't remember I don't remember
02:14:16 I don't know I'm
02:14:18 going to be tormented for the rest of my life
02:14:20 mystery chip that's how to get you
02:14:22 yeah
02:14:24 okay I have a question everyone
02:14:26 yeah opinion on
02:14:28 salt and vinegar
02:14:30 oh never been a fan
02:14:32 you know what
02:14:34 I'm surprised how popular
02:14:36 they are in England
02:14:38 byter loves them they're their favorite
02:14:40 when I was a kid I like
02:14:42 smelled like like I knew people
02:14:44 would eat them and I would smell it and think
02:14:46 it smelled disgusting and I was like
02:14:48 gross but then as an adult
02:14:50 I tried them and I'm like you know what I get
02:14:52 it so I've I I didn't
02:14:54 used to like them but I change my
02:14:56 right and I was not a fan
02:14:58 I used to hate them but now
02:15:00 sometimes a little bit is just
02:15:02 fine it depends on the brand
02:15:04 I think it's like the
02:15:06 it's the walkers I think
02:15:08 the UK version of them I feel like
02:15:10 I know that like some people are
02:15:12 against just like no it's
02:15:14 like some people just don't get salt and vinegar
02:15:16 but I guess we're all
02:15:18 we're all down with the strong yeah
02:15:20 I think we're all cool when I was young yeah
02:15:22 I've transitioned from the like childish
02:15:24 like it's gross I don't think it's gross
02:15:26 I just can't take too many
02:15:28 of them and I'm not a big fan
02:15:30 I like how it stains
02:15:32 your mouth
02:15:34 I like to over do it
02:15:36 with stuff like that
02:15:38 I gotta tell you a story
02:15:40 speaking of chips right I was eating
02:15:42 chips today but not real chips
02:15:44 because
02:15:46 somebody left
02:15:48 a monster energy drink
02:15:50 in my freezer
02:15:52 and it exploded
02:15:54 and then it froze to the edges
02:15:56 of the freezer
02:15:58 so I had to de-ice
02:16:00 the freezer but I noticed
02:16:02 that some of the ice
02:16:04 was green
02:16:06 and I was like this just seems like a damn waste
02:16:08 so I broke off chunks of this ice
02:16:10 frozen this and I tried it and I gotta tell you
02:16:12 it was it was delicious
02:16:14 it tasted like sweet
02:16:16 cotton candy
02:16:18 it was super good
02:16:20 this was the best ice
02:16:22 but then I was licking I'm like wait a minute
02:16:24 it wasn't a diet monster
02:16:26 these aren't keto ice chips
02:16:28 but it's okay
02:16:30 I only had a couple
02:16:32 anyway it was very excited
02:16:34 and I was like and like my friend
02:16:36 that same friend
02:16:38 who said that my burger was fucked up
02:16:40 even though it wasn't and he got me a second burger
02:16:42 he was there I'm saying like guys
02:16:44 you know you're not gonna believe me
02:16:46 it's frozen monster ice chips
02:16:48 it's actually super good
02:16:50 and of course everyone's like oh Ben
02:16:52 you're so fucking crazy
02:16:54 you're such a weird eccentric guy
02:16:56 just like when you said that watering down
02:16:58 your orange juice just gives you more orange juice
02:17:00 you're so crazy
02:17:02 but then exactly like that time
02:17:04 I got Lorenz to try some of this ice
02:17:06 and he's like it's actually really good
02:17:08 just like with the orange juice I was 100% right
02:17:10 fully exonerated
02:17:12 Ben are you aware of the product
02:17:14 it's a drop 50
02:17:16 which is just it's just
02:17:18 it's that they just took orange juice
02:17:20 they literally it's an ingredient
02:17:22 half orange juice half water
02:17:24 just half orange juice
02:17:26 why would you ever buy that
02:17:28 when you could just buy regular orange juice
02:17:30 for the same price and water it down
02:17:32 and get twice as much
02:17:34 because they're trying to pull the wool over your eyes
02:17:36 that's all there is to it
02:17:38 fucking cut your own orange juice with water dudes
02:17:40 with the samurai sword
02:17:42 by the way I sorry guys
02:17:44 double cheese is so good
02:17:46 double cheese delay like extra cheesy
02:17:48 flavors for chips are good
02:17:50 wait double cheese
02:17:52 I used to like those but
02:17:54 it's like the crazy like
02:17:56 flavor bomb chips they're too much
02:17:58 for me I can't I can't deal with that
02:18:00 sometimes I'll have too much
02:18:02 of one thing over like a two week
02:18:04 or you know whatever long
02:18:06 period and then like
02:18:08 I just have this aversion
02:18:10 do it completely like one time
02:18:12 like it was like Dr Pepper
02:18:14 and Domino's for me
02:18:16 and now I just cannot have it
02:18:18 at all anymore it also makes me sick
02:18:20 one time I got like a big I was a kid
02:18:22 and I got a big bag of salsa Verde
02:18:24 Doritos and I ate the whole
02:18:26 bag of salsa Verde Doritos they're kind of
02:18:28 spicy but they're pretty good and then
02:18:30 that night for dinner we had tacos
02:18:32 and then I woke up in the middle of the night
02:18:34 and I had to puke really bad and
02:18:36 I puked it all up and it was spicy
02:18:38 and it tasted Mexican
02:18:40 and the puke was like
02:18:42 I could taste the salsa Verde Doritos
02:18:44 and I didn't have Doritos for a long
02:18:46 time after that because real fucking nasty
02:18:48 makes sense
02:18:50 just my buddy Garf
02:18:52 my buddy Garf did the same thing with vodka
02:18:54 I think that's far more common experience
02:18:56 dude the thing about puking up vodka
02:18:58 is you get drunk on the way up too
