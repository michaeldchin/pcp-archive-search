00:00:00 I'm going to bless that guy. That son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Hello everyone, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's Ben Saint, it's Gibbontake.
00:00:19 And we've got a robot guest today.
00:00:25 Excuse me, I fucked it up.
00:00:33 I fucked it up and then I also swore in the first five seconds of the video, so the channel's going down.
00:00:39 This is Twitch from Reploid Revo, the Mega Man YouTube channel. Welcome to the show.
00:00:50 Thanks, I'm super happy to be here. Thank you so much.
00:00:54 Thanks for reaching out on Twitter to say you'd like to maybe talk about Mega Man or something sometime.
00:01:01 And yeah, I did. You know, this week, famously, this week I put out...
00:01:08 Twitch, you've got to understand, for the past six weeks or more on this show, I have every episode I've been saying,
00:01:19 I think the video's going to be out this week. This is definitely the week that it's done and I'm putting it out.
00:01:25 So it's finally happened, that's the context.
00:01:28 You know what, I'm guilty of that sort of thing too.
00:01:32 A highly anticipated video on my channel is Time Skimmer Episode 6, where I finally begin talking about stuff that happens after Mega Man X4.
00:01:44 And famously, I was like, yeah, it's going to be coming really soon.
00:01:50 And then it never came. And the reason why is because I wanted to get a set of animatics made for it, depicting the battle between X and Zero.
00:02:02 And I even got it voice acted. I got Lucas Gilbertson, the voice actor for Zero, to come and record lines.
00:02:10 It was a whole big to do. But then it became an entire animation.
00:02:14 And the person working on the animation, granted, it takes a very, very long time.
00:02:20 So it just kept getting pushed back and pushed back and pushed back.
00:02:28 And now the animation has been abandoned. And so I waited several years for this and now there's no animation.
00:02:38 So I'm going to go ahead and go forward with just releasing the episode.
00:02:42 You got to scale it back, yeah.
00:02:44 Yeah, unfortunately. But you know what? It does mean that that blockage is not there anymore and I can finally continue with the rest of the timeline.
00:02:50 I can only do so many. Who exactly is in what exactly is in a row?
00:02:56 Mega Man.
00:02:58 Yeah, Mega Man.
00:03:01 Gib, how many Mega Man's did you play? You said you played the first one.
00:03:07 I played a bit of the first one on the Wii virtual store and it was hard. I couldn't get past anything.
00:03:15 I think I beat Cut Man once.
00:03:17 That's a par for the course for Mega Man 1.
00:03:19 You just got to get the magnet beam.
00:03:23 What could that possibly be?
00:03:26 You just got to, is it not selfish? It's a magnet. That's also a beam.
00:03:30 Yeah.
00:03:31 There's one tool in Mega Man 1 and it's the magnet beam and it just lets you place platforms wherever you want basically.
00:03:42 So it's a big help but it's a little, I think it's in Crash Man's level.
00:03:47 No, it's in Magnet Man. I don't remember where it is.
00:03:50 Crash Man is 2 and Magnet Man is 3 so those are definitely not correct.
00:03:54 Wait, it was Guts Man that's Cut Man.
00:03:56 What the hell am I talking about? Yeah, you're right.
00:03:58 It's in Electman stage? I could be wrong.
00:04:00 I don't know where it is but the bottom line is it does make platforms but it's also very janky.
00:04:07 It's pretty janky.
00:04:08 The way that it works is that it creates a platform for as long as across the screen as you're holding the button down.
00:04:16 So the longer you hold the button down, the longer the platform is.
00:04:19 But as soon as you let go of that button, a timer is ticking down that you can't see.
00:04:23 It only lasts for like, I don't know, like 2 maybe 4 seconds tops and then it just vanishes.
00:04:29 And if you're standing on it when it vanishes, you unceremoniously plummet like a cinder block to the bottom of the screen and die.
00:04:35 Yeah, if you put it, you can shoot one out and then jump on it and then you shoot another one out quickly and then you jump on that
00:04:43 and you shoot another one out quickly and then you jump on it and if you do it quickly, you can cross pretty much any gap.
00:04:48 See, I vaguely remember, maybe I did find that and I used all of the energy points or whatever they're called, the PP for that thing.
00:04:57 And I ran out.
00:04:58 You gotta consider the energy points.
00:04:59 Is that what they're called?
00:05:01 I think they're called weapon energy is to generally agreed upon term.
00:05:06 It's like the secondary meter for the things that are not your health.
00:05:11 If you're reading one of the manuals, it's called a belt buckle for some reason.
00:05:17 What the magnet beam is?
00:05:18 No, just the weapon energy.
00:05:21 What?
00:05:22 Because they look like little buckles?
00:05:24 No, they don't.
00:05:25 I don't know.
00:05:26 Oh, the drops.
00:05:27 The drops kind of do.
00:05:28 Drops?
00:05:29 Yeah, they look like little lemons or like a big lemon sometimes.
00:05:31 I don't know if I have the picture anymore, but there's, I don't know if it's in the English manual or if this was on like a blockbuster pamphlet for renting the game.
00:05:40 But they absolutely were trying to describe the game and a lot of it doesn't make sense.
00:05:45 It says something like press down to crouch and I'm like, you absolutely cannot crouch in any Mega Man game until like the year 2000 or next five.
00:05:54 So that's a lie.
00:05:56 I read some of the translated guides, like the Japanese guides.
00:06:05 And some of them are very different, some of them are very funnily different.
00:06:11 The English ones are just, the English ones are just bad.
00:06:13 They don't explain the game properly.
00:06:15 They call the city Monsteropolis for some reason.
00:06:18 Yeah.
00:06:19 Calls the, calls the robot masters.
00:06:22 Like robotic humanoids or something or no, robot like humanoids.
00:06:28 It calls them.
00:06:29 Yeah.
00:06:30 I know there's a handful of really weird English.
00:06:33 Well, you know, it's funny because in Japan, Dr. Light's robots, the robot masters are not actually called robot masters.
00:06:39 I think they are just called like humanoid robots or something to that effect.
00:06:43 No, in the first one, I know they don't call them humanoid robots, which would be correct.
00:06:48 They call them robot like humanoids, which doesn't make any sense.
00:06:51 Right.
00:06:52 And then in a lot of the English manuals, they were just like, oh, they have human faces.
00:06:57 Therefore they are cyborgs and they just converted everything to cyborgs because I guess it was the 80s and cyborgs were in vogue or something.
00:07:05 Sounds cool.
00:07:08 I saw one.
00:07:09 I really wish I could find it.
00:07:11 But I have like scans of this manual and it's like, you are Mega Man.
00:07:15 Last creation of Dr. Kine after he was murdered by his evil lab assistant, Dr. Wiley, spelled with like an E.
00:07:24 I know they spelled it Dr. Willie.
00:07:26 They spell it Dr. Willie a couple times.
00:07:29 Yeah.
00:07:30 Dr. Wright and Dr. Willie.
00:07:32 Yeah.
00:07:33 I mean that I can, I guess forgive.
00:07:35 But Dr. Kine, I've seen Dr. Kine and I'm like, what are you?
00:07:39 K-I-N-E.
00:07:40 K-Y-N-E.
00:07:42 Very, very strange.
00:07:44 I was telling Gif that she should play two because one is hard and it's kind of bad.
00:07:52 You should play two and just get the metal blades and then the game's easy.
00:07:57 Yes.
00:07:58 That is accurate.
00:08:00 Yeah.
00:08:01 Because two is the best selling Mega Man game of all time up until like a month ago.
00:08:08 Yeah.
00:08:09 Up until a month ago when Eleven just knocked it off.
00:08:12 Don't.
00:08:13 Shocking.
00:08:14 The manual by the way.
00:08:16 Because two is when they actually figured out like how to make, two is when they hit the formula and they made like the first good Mega Man.
00:08:24 I mean one is fine.
00:08:25 I'm not trying to shit on one too hard.
00:08:27 It's janky.
00:08:28 It's competent.
00:08:29 It's smooth.
00:08:30 It's not like polished.
00:08:31 Yeah.
00:08:32 But you can see what was coming.
00:08:34 And then three is kind of just easier in general.
00:08:37 They give you so many health drops in three.
00:08:40 Well, right up until the Doc Robot stages.
00:08:43 Well, yeah.
00:08:45 Three is they give you, they lull you into a false sense of security.
00:08:48 You're like, wow, I might actually be getting good at Mega Man.
00:08:50 And then Doc Robot comes in and he just ruins your day.
00:08:53 The robot, yeah, the robot master levels, the eight normal levels are easy.
00:08:58 And it get, you know, most, most of them get really hard at the end.
00:09:02 But yeah.
00:09:03 Yeah.
00:09:04 I see the belt buckles.
00:09:06 Yeah.
00:09:07 In bulk.
00:09:08 In bulk.
00:09:09 Oh, let me see.
00:09:10 Let me see.
00:09:11 Belt buckles.
00:09:12 Pick up the belt buckles to make your weapon.
00:09:14 The helmet adds an extra man.
00:09:16 Wait, propeller.
00:09:17 Oh, yes.
00:09:18 I forget what it's called.
00:09:20 There's an item in, it's a special item.
00:09:23 It's in Mega Man.
00:09:24 And I think there's only one of them.
00:09:26 It just gives you like a bajillion points.
00:09:28 Yeah.
00:09:29 It's the, it's like, it's a Japanese thing.
00:09:31 It's got a Japanese name.
00:09:32 Yeah.
00:09:33 And it's, and it's a thing.
00:09:34 It's like a Capcom puts this thing in like a lot of their games is like a mystery.
00:09:37 Yeah.
00:09:38 It was a power up or something in, I think in 1941 or 1942, like a Capcom shoot them
00:09:44 up.
00:09:45 And so they've just been putting it as like an Easter egg and other things.
00:09:48 And I know in other games, it's there and it like is like a full life and weapon
00:09:53 restore.
00:09:54 Yes.
00:09:55 But in this one, it just gives you points, which are totally useless.
00:09:58 Yeah.
00:09:59 Well, I'm so glad they dropped the points thing in Mega Man 2.
00:10:02 It's so funny that there's points in the first one.
00:10:05 Yeah.
00:10:06 And what, you know what, I think also makes Mega Man 1 harder because of the points.
00:10:12 That is now a useless pickup that is on the drop table for when you kill enemies.
00:10:17 In most games, when you kill an enemy, it's either health or weapon energy or nothing.
00:10:22 In this, now it's you have two chances for nothing and two chances for weapon energy
00:10:27 or health.
00:10:28 You know what I mean?
00:10:29 How did I forget that they call him Dr. Kine?
00:10:33 Like what the what the?
00:10:34 Well, I don't know if you had seen this particular thing because I think this isn't the
00:10:38 Yeah, what is this?
00:10:40 I don't remember the origin of this off the top of my head.
00:10:42 I know I have it in a video somewhere, but I think this is this might be a blockbuster
00:10:47 insert, like a little pamphlet that came with the game when you rented it.
00:10:51 Okay.
00:10:52 So I think it's not official.
00:10:54 Right.
00:10:55 Like it was one of those things that because blockbuster in place of giving everyone like
00:11:00 a complete inbox copy of a game.
00:11:02 They would often give you a pamphlet because back in the day, certain NES games.
00:11:07 I mean, honestly, we're just you couldn't play them unless you knew what you were doing.
00:11:11 So the manuals would often give you critical information on how to play.
00:11:16 And so to kind of circumvent giving everyone a complete inbox copy of a game, they just
00:11:20 whipped up these like quick little like pamphlets which like skimmed through the manuals.
00:11:24 I think wasn't wasn't there.
00:11:27 I think I've seen I swear I've seen a of a gaming historian video.
00:11:32 You ever watched the gaming historian on YouTube?
00:11:35 Occasionally.
00:11:36 Yeah, there's he has one that's about the lawsuit between Nintendo and blockbuster where
00:11:42 basically Nintendo tried to sue block really they wanted them to stop renting their games
00:11:48 because that that was like, you know, hurting their business model.
00:11:51 But the way but there was no legal way they could do that.
00:11:54 So instead they attack them on the grounds that the game manuals are like copyrighted material
00:12:00 and they're not allowed to to give those out.
00:12:04 And so yeah, I think it would think it might have been because of that lawsuit that blockbuster
00:12:07 issued a lot of like that they wrote up their own like yeah.
00:12:11 Oh yeah, that's that's totally a possibility.
00:12:13 Like that sounds like that lines up perfectly with this.
00:12:16 So mm-hmm.
00:12:18 I have watched like every gaming story and video that's ever been made.
00:12:23 Oh, wasn't wasn't there a Dr. Cain in Mega Man X?
00:12:27 Wasn't that the X guy?
00:12:29 That's Dr. Cain.
00:12:30 Dr. Cain is he's sort of like the Dr. Light replacement in X, but then he kind of just disappears
00:12:36 after X3 and is never heard again.
00:12:38 Well, I actually have a strong idea of actually where he ended up and this is the agreed upon
00:12:44 theory by most people who like care to know.
00:12:47 Okay.
00:12:48 So Dr. Cain forms the Maverick Hunters in response to the first handful of Mavericks
00:12:53 that appear in the X series, right?
00:12:55 Yeah, he like he talks to the council though, which we never see them all mysterious council
00:13:00 and they're like, maybe we should just stop making reploids and like, you know, is that
00:13:03 is that what they call it the council in?
00:13:05 Well, it's in the journal of Dr. Cain.
00:13:07 It's called the council and the interesting is the the journal is only English canon.
00:13:13 It's it was just made up for the English manual and no such thing exists in Japan.
00:13:17 However, I know that much.
00:13:19 Japan later adapted it and changed some of the details.
00:13:22 So it retroactively did come into Canada USA USA USA.
00:13:28 A rare instance of when English canon has actually added something useful because it didn't hurt
00:13:34 anything by adding it there.
00:13:36 So he he's like the council has, you know, met with me today and something something
00:13:41 considered stopping production of all reploids.
00:13:44 But I think that's a step too far.
00:13:46 So then he builds the Maverick Hunters.
00:13:49 So Dr. Cain is actually the leader of the Maverick Hunters.
00:13:53 He's running the organization up until X3, as you said.
00:13:56 And even though we don't see him in X4 in the English manual, which again, this hasn't
00:14:00 officially been adopted, but it says he created repliforce.
00:14:03 I know in the X4 manual in the English manual, it says that he is he was one of the he's
00:14:08 founded repliforce.
00:14:09 So he's not actually in the game.
00:14:11 Yeah, he's not actually in the game.
00:14:13 He's just kind of like mentioned, you can even in the yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:16 So so peep this, the official origin for sickness.
00:14:20 Remember, I remember you're talking about him.
00:14:22 He's like the leader of the hunters and he's like, well, he doesn't really do anything.
00:14:24 Well, yeah, it's cause all of his story happens like out of the game.
00:14:27 Yeah.
00:14:28 Apparently, he became leader of the hunters.
00:14:31 And this is exactly rough on paraphrasing, but this is as deep of info as we get.
00:14:37 He became leader of the Maverick Hunters after the previous leader of the Maverick Hunters
00:14:42 resigned out of shame for how the repliforce incident was handled.
00:14:47 So basically, I think it's Dr. Cain.
00:14:51 Where does it where does it say that?
00:14:54 Okay, because because I know that like he's the in five, he's the new leader, which
00:14:58 implies that there was an old leader.
00:15:00 Right.
00:15:01 And he's no longer there, but I don't.
00:15:03 Yeah, if you're going to kill me because I don't have this information on hand, but
00:15:06 I swear, I'm telling you, there's no entire channel of people who will back me up on
00:15:11 it.
00:15:12 I would.
00:15:13 I would love to see it.
00:15:14 I think it came in one of the.
00:15:16 So there's like these guides called like, like the Rockman X Psycho Dysacon guides.
00:15:22 And they've had they've been making them from X one all the way to like X five.
00:15:28 Are they like books?
00:15:29 Yeah, they're like, they're like, excuse me.
00:15:32 Yeah, they're like strategy guides.
00:15:34 Yeah.
00:15:35 They also include like bits of lore.
00:15:37 That's where we got the information for Iris and Colonel, how they used to be like one
00:15:41 Reploid and then they got like split into two because they have like conflicting personality
00:15:46 differences.
00:15:47 Yeah.
00:15:48 That's where we get information about like just like different, like random things.
00:15:53 Like sometimes there's motivations for the for the Maverick Hunters and also for the Mavericks
00:15:57 that you fight.
00:15:58 Like that's where I get the information about like Gravity Beetle and stuff.
00:16:01 Like I was brothers with Boomer Coanger.
00:16:04 I know I've seen some of these before.
00:16:06 What are they called?
00:16:07 Dyso.
00:16:08 I'm probably going to butcher the spelling, but it's Psycho Dysacon.
00:16:13 Yeah, I saw some of these.
00:16:16 Are these all translated?
00:16:17 I don't know if all of them are translated.
00:16:20 I believe most of them have been.
00:16:22 However, the person who did the original translations said that they did a pretty poor job and they're
00:16:27 like, don't trust these translations.
00:16:28 Like I'd like to do them again someday.
00:16:31 So, but, but it does seem to be information that has been like corroborated with like other
00:16:38 sources.
00:16:39 And so it's like not everything is like a hundred percent accurate, but I mean, like
00:16:43 it's the best we've got.
00:16:44 So, yeah.
00:16:45 But, um, yeah.
00:16:47 So the implication is that well, Dr. Cain is running the Maverick Hunters.
00:16:51 He's the only person we see running them up to X3.
00:16:53 It makes perfect.
00:16:55 It makes perfect sense that after, after the Red Play Force Rebellion.
00:17:00 The leader, whoever that is would resign and it makes sense that it would be Dr. Cain,
00:17:06 whether it's Dr. Cain or not, that makes sense.
00:17:08 But if it, who else would it be besides, besides Dr. Cain?
00:17:12 So, yeah, and since he's the only guy that we've seen leading them up to that point.
00:17:16 So he's just like, you know what?
00:17:18 I really handle, I really dropped the ball with Repple Force pretty badly.
00:17:22 That would mean that he was simultaneously leader of the Maverick Hunters and Repple
00:17:27 Force.
00:17:28 And he says no one man should have all that power.
00:17:31 So he resigned because he was a big gay fan.
00:17:35 He was a big gay fan.
00:17:36 He was right.
00:17:37 I can't, that's why, that's why it's all happened.
00:17:40 I just pictured now Dr. Cain listening to like a bunch of old Kanye West albums and he's like,
00:17:45 he's like, yeah, he was a genius.
00:17:47 He was ahead of his time.
00:17:49 But it's light years ahead of anything we have now.
00:17:53 He says, he shakes his head and he says, ah, too bad in 2022.
00:17:57 He went crazy and ran for president and came into submitting.
00:18:03 They call it the fall.
00:18:04 The fall started in 2022 and then, and then the Irish Rebellion of 2024.
00:18:13 Dark times ahead for humanity.
00:18:16 Boy, I would have hated to be alive back in 2022.
00:18:22 Yeah.
00:18:23 Oh goodness.
00:18:26 Sick.
00:18:27 I forget what we were talking about before.
00:18:30 I'm sorry.
00:18:31 I have a tendency to do that.
00:18:32 I just, I'm like a banana in a fruit smoothie when it comes to Megaman.
00:18:36 I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little.
00:18:37 Take over everything.
00:18:38 I'm a little abashed because, you know, I made this big video where I explained Megaman.
00:18:42 But like, I think I know in my heart that you probably know more about the subject than
00:18:46 I do.
00:18:47 So, well, I mean, I want to keep you off the subject to avoid embarrassing me.
00:18:51 No.
00:18:52 Listen, I'm going to tell you one thing.
00:18:54 You did a fantastic job and I'm listening, like actively listening.
00:18:58 And I'm like, you haven't said anything like wrong.
00:19:02 Like the only things that like, that I wouldn't agree with or that I wouldn't even call them
00:19:08 wrong, just things where I'm like, I kind of differ are points of, of like, it's kind
00:19:13 of like fuzzy where it's like, well, you could think of it any which way that you want.
00:19:17 Like there's no like solid answer for this thing or not.
00:19:20 You know what I mean?
00:19:21 So, I mean, at that point, it just comes down to like personal preference.
00:19:24 I used to be like way more like, like iron fisted about that sort of thing.
00:19:28 But I've since loosened up because I find that Megaman kind of does as far as established
00:19:34 as its canon and story is.
00:19:37 There are certain areas where it's like, nope, this is just a little fuzzy and you just kind
00:19:41 of have to deal with it.
00:19:42 Like, so a good point that someone brought up shout outs to Zan on my, on my Discord server
00:19:48 in the Lord discussion.
00:19:49 He, he mentioned, he brought up a good point.
00:19:51 He goes, what is the cannon way to play Megaman X five?
00:19:55 Oh, X or zero.
00:19:57 Well, not even that.
00:19:59 Do you collect all of the, do you succeed in collecting all of the enigma cannon parts?
00:20:03 Or do you just fire it and you destroy the, the space station in one shot?
00:20:07 Like, what is the story?
00:20:09 Oh, yeah.
00:20:10 Like in the history books, you know, do they, do they say, you know, matter of fact or X
00:20:15 and zero go and get all the parts and then they fire the cannon and it didn't work.
00:20:19 So then they launched zero at it in a shuttle and then that did work.
00:20:22 Or do they say they just launched both without, you know, without getting anything and it just worked.
00:20:27 Yeah.
00:20:28 Or did it fail?
00:20:30 Because well, it, well it can't have failed because that's true.
00:20:33 Yeah.
00:20:34 Yeah, I know the cannon ending is that zero doesn't go Maverick, but there's two different
00:20:38 ways that that can happen.
00:20:39 I understand.
00:20:40 Yeah.
00:20:41 It raises an interesting point because for once the story actually is determined.
00:20:45 Like in every other game, it's like, yeah, you beat all eight Mavericks and that's it.
00:20:48 But in this game, the Mavericks are literally optional.
00:20:50 So do you beat one Maverick and call it quits?
00:20:53 Do you beat, you know, like all of them?
00:20:55 Do you beat like two or three and then just, you know, launch?
00:20:58 I mean, even in X4, there's differences between the X playthrough and the zero playthrough
00:21:05 that, like, did, like, did X fight general?
00:21:09 Well, like in X's playthrough, yes, but in zero's playthrough, not necessarily.
00:21:14 You have to fight general as a zero.
00:21:17 You actually do need to fight him.
00:21:19 Oh, you do?
00:21:21 Yeah, it's guaranteed.
00:21:22 Damn it.
00:21:23 Okay.
00:21:24 The only thing that happens is in X's playthrough, you fight Colonel twice in place of a cutscene.
00:21:29 So zero gets the prepare yourself cutscene, but X just fights Colonel like for real.
00:21:34 Stop the coop now.
00:21:36 Yeah.
00:21:37 It's not too late.
00:21:39 Never.
00:21:40 I'm not gonna lie.
00:21:41 I didn't have nothing against that voice acting.
00:21:43 I thought they did a pretty decent job for the time, comparatively to, like, if you look
00:21:48 at, like, what they were up against, like, with Resident Evil and, like, some other horrible
00:21:52 games, it's not the worst.
00:21:55 No, you're not wrong.
00:21:57 You're not wrong.
00:21:58 I think, you know, coop is a little silly because it's like, okay, you literally said
00:22:02 the wrong word.
00:22:03 But I didn't have a problem with the voices they chose.
00:22:07 As a matter of fact, I think Shake Man explores the best.
00:22:10 I think if I was a kid, I probably would have just been like, yeah, cool.
00:22:13 Like, yeah.
00:22:14 Like, I didn't know any better.
00:22:15 That's just what they said.
00:22:16 Okay, I will say, I think General's voice is pretty bad.
00:22:20 I think.
00:22:21 Yes.
00:22:22 They picked a very, they picked, like, a reedy voice for a guy, like a 40 foot tall man made
00:22:27 of gold.
00:22:28 They think it should be a little deeper.
00:22:30 I think you should have a slightly more booming voice.
00:22:32 Yeah.
00:22:33 In my opinion.
00:22:34 He absolutely needs to shout, sound like some sort of, like, big shogun or something.
00:22:39 Like, instead of this, he's just, get out of my sight, you know.
00:22:45 We are the repliforce.
00:22:47 We must do this.
00:22:49 Remember, we will not defy the humans.
00:22:52 Yeah, like, I don't know.
00:22:54 He sounded a bit like Steve Urkel.
00:22:57 Gib.
00:22:58 You know, I don't know what their deal was.
00:22:59 Hey, you know, you know, yeah, well, that's just my problem.
00:23:05 In the game, General's voice sounds more like Lenny, even though Homer is the one who's
00:23:12 giant, who's the biggest man in the world and covered in gold.
00:23:15 Hey, Homer.
00:23:16 Hey, Homer.
00:23:17 We're going to fire a space laser.
00:23:19 Hey, guys.
00:23:20 Notice anything different about me?
00:23:23 Hey, Colonel.
00:23:24 Hey, Colonel.
00:23:25 Notice anything different about me?
00:23:27 Oh, you're the biggest man in the world now and you're covered in gold.
00:23:31 Not a half bad Colonel, gotta say.
00:23:34 Thanks.
00:23:35 I like Sigma the most.
00:23:36 I think the guy, and you know what's funny?
00:23:38 I think the guy that did Sigma is the only one of those people who went on to do, like,
00:23:42 a really serious voice acting career afterwards.
00:23:45 Hmm.
00:23:46 He, how does he sound?
00:23:47 Sigma was chewing up the scenery.
00:23:48 He loved it.
00:23:49 He kind of just sounds like, um, he's sort of like, ugh.
00:23:53 Ugh.
00:23:54 Oh, my Maverick Hunters, what will you do?
00:23:57 You will, yes.
00:23:58 Why do you, why do you do this?
00:24:01 Why don't you kill him?
00:24:03 I forget, I forget any of his lines.
00:24:05 Um, yeah.
00:24:06 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:24:07 He sounded fine.
00:24:08 He's, he's, he's getting into it.
00:24:10 I think later on they made his voice a little too, like, not that there's anything wrong
00:24:14 with his voice being deeper in other portrayals, but I almost feel like it, um, it's a little
00:24:19 too breathy for my liking, I think.
00:24:21 I liked him better when, when he was speaking from the back of his throat and like a little
00:24:25 bit more Palpatine, you know what I'm saying?
00:24:28 Hmm.
00:24:29 I like that.
00:24:30 I like that.
00:24:31 That's just, that's just me though.
00:24:33 Um, Gib.
00:24:35 Hmm.
00:24:36 Hi.
00:24:37 What's up?
00:24:39 Uh, nothing.
00:24:41 I'm just, I'm just, I'm, I'm, I have no way to, like, interact with this conversation.
00:24:46 Don't want to, don't want to exclude you.
00:24:48 Don't want to, don't want to apologize.
00:24:49 I mean, we can talk about the lecture because I have been watching that.
00:24:52 I'm like up to the Mega Man and base part.
00:24:56 Is that, I guess, I don't know if you have, you know, sorry, you know, as I've been saying,
00:25:02 I've been, I've been hyping this video up for, for weeks and weeks on here.
00:25:05 So, um, it's time, it's time to pay that all off.
00:25:09 But, um, I don't know if there's anything, if there was anything that stuck out about
00:25:13 it to you and you wanted to bring up, then that would be something we all would be familiar
00:25:17 with.
00:25:18 Or maybe if there was anything, uh, uh, maybe you could, as to anything you wanted to clarify,
00:25:22 me and, me and Twitch are here with our expertise.
00:25:25 Well, I mean, I feel like I, I feel like I haven't gotten to the really weird fucked up
00:25:29 stuff yet.
00:25:30 Cause I'm not.
00:25:31 Oh, did you not, did you not finish it?
00:25:33 I haven't finished it yet.
00:25:34 Oh.
00:25:35 I haven't had enough time, uh, spare.
00:25:37 Uh, but.
00:25:38 Yeah.
00:25:39 I'm, I'm just finished with like legends, uh, to.
00:25:42 I gotta be, I gotta be honest.
00:25:44 I love legends so much.
00:25:46 I, I love it now.
00:25:47 Uh, Gib, you should play legends.
00:25:49 You'd really like it.
00:25:50 I, I've seen legends.
00:25:52 It looks fun.
00:25:53 Also, just because I've been following this artist for a while.
00:25:57 Um, Arthur Vader has been making like an indie game that is like a Mega Man Legends-esque.
00:26:02 Oh, is that the, um, the Delta Gal thing?
00:26:05 Yes.
00:26:06 Yes.
00:26:07 They took out Delta Gal.
00:26:08 Arthur Vader.
00:26:09 Big shout out moment.
00:26:10 Big, big appropriate shout out moment for that game.
00:26:12 Yeah.
00:26:13 That game looks fantastic.
00:26:14 Um, it does.
00:26:15 I, that guy follows me on Twitter.
00:26:19 I love the, um, the, the low poly PS one anime aesthetic.
00:26:24 Maybe we should, maybe we should, maybe we should ask him, maybe we should ask him if he wants
00:26:27 to be a guest.
00:26:28 Yeah.
00:26:29 You should.
00:26:30 He'd probably, he'd probably, he'd probably.
00:26:32 Okay.
00:26:33 Okay.
00:26:34 All right.
00:26:35 Anyway, what were you saying?
00:26:36 But yeah, Mega Man Legends looks fun.
00:26:37 And it's of all the Mega Man games.
00:26:39 I, I like 3D environments.
00:26:41 I'm a big 3D person.
00:26:42 The graph, the graphical style is exactly what you always say you like the best.
00:26:47 Plus it's just a, it's just chill.
00:26:51 It's a chill time.
00:26:53 I think you nailed it when you said in the, in the video you said that, um, Legends 1 is
00:26:59 more charming.
00:27:00 And what did you say about Legends 2?
00:27:02 I said 2 is more, more epic.
00:27:04 Yes.
00:27:05 That's exactly it.
00:27:06 Um, I always, I got that exact same, that exact same feeling.
00:27:10 When I, when I heard you say that, I was like.
00:27:12 Bigger world in a darker tone.
00:27:14 Yes.
00:27:15 When I heard you say that in my head, I'm like, this guy gets it.
00:27:17 Like, that's exactly, that is exactly right.
00:27:19 Cause I always tell people, they're always like, which one is better?
00:27:22 Legends 1 or Legends 2?
00:27:23 And I'm like, guys, you can't make me choose like that.
00:27:26 It's a little bit.
00:27:27 Yeah, I didn't, I think, I hear people say like one better, but I think there's things,
00:27:31 there's things to like about 2 as well.
00:27:33 Well, yeah.
00:27:34 Like, so in Legends 1, like, and this is going to, I'm going to sound like a big, big old
00:27:38 sap here.
00:27:39 I played Legends 1 very recently, and my girlfriend was watching me go through the whole thing
00:27:44 and I cried during the ending.
00:27:45 I got like all emotional and I was like, oh my God, like these are people that not only
00:27:50 did I like figuratively grow up with in the game, but like I literally grew up with these
00:27:55 people in this game as a kid playing this in, what was it, 97, 98 when it came out?
00:28:02 That sounds about right.
00:28:03 Yeah.
00:28:04 And you know, so like you grow attached to them and I was explaining to her, I said,
00:28:08 if you play this game, you're stuck on one island, but you explore every single nook
00:28:13 and cranny of this island and you get to know the people on the island and every single
00:28:17 person has new dialogue when anything happens.
00:28:20 Like, I'm talking like, literally there's events that take like, I don't know, like
00:28:25 20 seconds tops to complete, and they will literally change their dialogue as soon as
00:28:29 that new thing has happened.
00:28:31 And so you're, it's more cozy.
00:28:33 You get to learn about these people's lives, you know, and like you kind of like become
00:28:40 part of the island.
00:28:41 You become part of their little community.
00:28:43 And when he leaves, it is like genuinely like all that when they're all, yeah, let's
00:28:49 talk, let's talk, let's talk spoilers.
00:28:51 But I don't give any spoilers.
00:28:53 Yeah.
00:28:54 When at the end, it's just like, oh, like I get it.
00:28:57 Like even though it's just like it's kind of like typical like sappy cartoony stuff.
00:29:02 Like it's the one time in like any sort of media where I was like, oh, like I feel what
00:29:08 they were going for.
00:29:09 It's not like, it's not like in other cartoons where they're like, you know, we'll see you
00:29:13 again sometime.
00:29:14 You know, and I'm like, they're never going to see those people again.
00:29:17 Like, yeah.
00:29:18 But like this is the one time where they had a scene like that and I'm like, ow, like
00:29:22 that's hitting me like square in my heart.
00:29:24 This actually like hurts.
00:29:26 Like it's like a happy sadness.
00:29:28 I don't know how else to describe it.
00:29:30 But then I play legends too.
00:29:32 And I'm like, this game, like you said, this game was more epic.
00:29:35 It's not bad.
00:29:36 It's not worse than legends one.
00:29:37 In fact, the gameplay is much more improved.
00:29:40 But the presentation is like, it doesn't have it does not.
00:29:45 It definitely doesn't give you like a cozy like, I know these people sort of.
00:29:50 Yeah.
00:29:51 Because you don't get enough time on each island to get to know them.
00:29:54 There's only one island where you get to actually like sort of get to know people.
00:29:58 And that's Kalbania Island with snowy one.
00:30:01 Well, the snowy one too, because you go there quite often.
00:30:04 So there in Kalbania, because on Kalbania Island, it's like that little one that's
00:30:08 like just got like the girl and her two brothers, like the two wild kids.
00:30:11 Oh, yeah.
00:30:12 And you kind of like get to know them a bit because you can talk to them often and
00:30:16 they send you letters back at Yashunka town with the snowy one.
00:30:21 And you go to the post office.
00:30:23 And so like you kind of that's a little bit of that.
00:30:26 But yeah, you're basically it's like a globe trotting adventure.
00:30:28 So you don't really have enough time to like sit there and get to know the people of the island.
00:30:33 Do you?
00:30:34 You know.
00:30:35 Yeah.
00:30:36 Did you ever play a game called Phenotopia?
00:30:41 No, I've never heard of that one.
00:30:43 Okay.
00:30:44 Well, it was a it was a Newgrounds game, but it was like a side scrolling action RPG,
00:30:49 a bit in the vein of Cave Story, but like without like gunplay.
00:30:55 But I played that a long time ago.
00:30:57 And then when I played Legends, I was like, wow, some even though even though this is
00:31:01 like a 3D free roaming adventure and that was like a 2D side scrolling action adventure,
00:31:05 there's something very similar about like the pixelated graphic style and there's something
00:31:10 because because in Phenotopia, you go around, you meet talk to villagers, you like do favors
00:31:17 for them, you find them stuff and trade stuff with them to like upgrade your equipment and
00:31:21 all that.
00:31:22 Mm hmm.
00:31:23 You explore ruins.
00:31:24 There is a sort of like secret science fiction backstory that with dark implications that
00:31:32 you uncover.
00:31:33 It's like this is this is just this is Phenotopia.
00:31:37 I was playing Legends.
00:31:38 I like this is just Phenotopia.
00:31:39 Right.
00:31:40 They Phenotopia just ripped this game off completely and Phenotopia is awesome.
00:31:45 They remade it.
00:31:46 They remade it on the on the switch.
00:31:48 It's on the switch now.
00:31:49 Really?
00:31:50 It's awesome.
00:31:51 I think it's called Phenotopia Awakenings.
00:31:52 I haven't yet.
00:31:53 I haven't played the remake, but like they did like a full like read.
00:31:56 I don't have to look into this.
00:31:58 It's a good child of Newgrounds.
00:32:00 So yeah, it was, um, it was like, uh, like Newgrounds.
00:32:04 It wasn't even just like some random guy posted it to Newgrounds.
00:32:07 I think Newgrounds like funded this guy.
00:32:09 Like they did like a big full page spread on the on the on the main page when it came
00:32:14 out.
00:32:15 Right.
00:32:16 They sort of did like a lot to do a little bit.
00:32:18 Yeah, a little bit.
00:32:19 That's awesome.
00:32:20 It's a good game.
00:32:21 It's a good ass game.
00:32:22 Yeah.
00:32:23 It sounds like a good ass game.
00:32:24 I think anything that lets you, any game that lets you like emotionally connect to a
00:32:28 10 PCs, um, I think it's doing a great job because you do feel more connected and you
00:32:33 feel more like satisfaction and more like, um, I'm not sure what the word is, but like
00:32:39 it's just a bigger deal to you.
00:32:41 Like it has more meaning when you like actually finish quests because not only are you getting
00:32:45 like, oh cool, I got the item to go give to the next person to go do whatever.
00:32:48 You're also getting an emotional payoff.
00:32:49 So like it feels good.
00:32:51 It's, it's Fino.
00:32:52 It's spelled like Phoenix, by the way.
00:32:54 So it's like P H O E N O T O P.
00:32:59 Got it.
00:33:00 Right.
00:33:01 Phonetopia.
00:33:02 Phonetopia.
00:33:03 Uh, gave you said you made it to the Mega Man Legends part.
00:33:09 I think I got, I think I finished that and then you were talking about Mega Man and base.
00:33:13 I was a little confused because you didn't draw a line was based made by Dr. Wiley.
00:33:17 Yes.
00:33:18 Yeah.
00:33:19 That's sort of a reveal like part way through Mega Man seven, I think.
00:33:24 Yeah.
00:33:25 It's part way through Mega Man seven.
00:33:26 I think I eventually draw that.
00:33:28 I eventually draw that line.
00:33:30 Yeah.
00:33:31 Base was made accidentally by Dr. Wiley.
00:33:35 Well, he, he's, um, oh, I didn't mention this, but like, okay, all the, all the robots have
00:33:41 the serial numbers and base is, base actually has a serial number, but he's not a, a light,
00:33:48 a Dr. Wiley number.
00:33:49 He's like a super Dr. Wiley number.
00:33:51 He's called like special Wiley number.
00:33:53 Yeah.
00:33:54 He's like, he's SW, he's SW.
00:33:57 I'm messing it up.
00:33:59 SWN.
00:34:00 Yes.
00:34:01 SWN zero, zero one or just one or something.
00:34:05 Whereas zero is, is, is DWN infinity.
00:34:09 He's not a special Dr. Wiley number.
00:34:10 He's just a regular Dr. Wiley number, but he's number infinity.
00:34:14 Yeah.
00:34:15 He's supposed to be like the end.
00:34:17 Like there is nothing, you know, there's nothing more than him.
00:34:20 You know what I'm saying?
00:34:21 Like that's.
00:34:22 Yeah.
00:34:23 I think that's kind of cool.
00:34:24 Whereas X, he's not a light number.
00:34:26 He doesn't have a serial number because he's not part of a series.
00:34:29 He's, he's his own person and his name.
00:34:31 A person.
00:34:32 Yeah.
00:34:33 And his name X is like a variable X because he has infinite potential because he can be
00:34:37 whatever he wants to be.
00:34:38 Oh, it's beautiful.
00:34:39 It is.
00:34:40 Like I've always had people ask me, they're like, what's X is a serial number?
00:34:43 I'm like, well, if it had to be anything, it would probably just be X.
00:34:47 But I don't think.
00:34:48 Yeah.
00:34:49 I think that would defeat the purpose of what light is trying to, trying to illustrate.
00:34:57 So I think he would just not give him a number at all.
00:35:01 He would just be like X, you, you aren't.
00:35:03 I said this in one of my videos.
00:35:05 X is not a robot with the ability to think like a person.
00:35:09 He is a person who happens to be a robot or something.
00:35:12 Totally.
00:35:13 What's this?
00:35:14 Sort of like X, if he wanted to, could choose his own name.
00:35:18 Yeah.
00:35:19 And that would be his serial number.
00:35:21 I'm just putting this here because you can see in teeny, teeny, tiny little letters.
00:35:25 It says DWN infinity.
00:35:29 You see where it says like Omega because you're dealing.
00:35:33 Oh, I see.
00:35:34 Oh, I see.
00:35:35 Bottom right.
00:35:36 It's a doctor dot W dot.
00:35:40 And number, number infinity.
00:35:42 Yeah.
00:35:43 Oh, yeah.
00:35:44 Because this is an emission where I believe you're going to confront Omega or something.
00:35:50 And so the implication is that Omega is DWN infinity because he's inhabiting zero's original
00:35:57 body.
00:35:58 Is this where that comes from that he's DWN number infinity?
00:36:02 No.
00:36:03 Okay.
00:36:04 This is the, this is the first like in game confirmation of that.
00:36:08 But I believe it was another thing that was like confirmed in a, you know, on the back
00:36:12 of a soda can or something like that in Japan.
00:36:15 Yeah.
00:36:16 Yeah.
00:36:17 But it's a thing that's always been known.
00:36:19 Everyone's because I've heard that even since I was a kid, they were like, no, he's DWN
00:36:22 infinity.
00:36:23 I think, I think that was first confirmed around Mega Man X five where like the Wiley zero
00:36:28 connection was like, like right in your face.
00:36:31 There's no escaping it anymore.
00:36:33 I mean, arguably X four, but they don't really delve into it too much.
00:36:37 But that's when they were like really like, look, he's made by Wiley.
00:36:40 This is the connection.
00:36:41 This is what's going on.
00:36:42 So it was confirmed in a book somewhere and it's spread throughout like the, the old
00:36:47 early 2000s Mega Man websites that I used to frequent.
00:36:52 Shout outs to Mega Man Network and Mega Man homepage.
00:36:57 This is like into creates like they into creates loves their references.
00:37:01 So like they were absolutely going to be like, we're going to cram as much references in
00:37:05 here as possible.
00:37:07 That's a good one.
00:37:08 So that that's a good one right there.
00:37:11 And I don't have it handy.
00:37:13 I'm desperately trying to find it.
00:37:15 This is actually cut content.
00:37:17 I think you can find it on the cutting room floor in zeros like opening area where you
00:37:26 like the in-game cut scene where CL walks on screen and he's in his like little capsule
00:37:31 thingy when he's like hanging there with no arms.
00:37:35 Yeah.
00:37:36 So there's like the artwork of him hanging, but there's also like the in-game scene,
00:37:39 like where he's like where he's there.
00:37:41 There's actually a wall that they removed, I guess, so that you can see him better.
00:37:45 And the wall has the words like, like warning virus and a symbol.
00:37:52 And you can't really read that it says virus because it's like broken.
00:37:55 It's like kind of like, like, like messed up.
00:37:58 Yeah.
00:37:59 But the symbol is there.
00:38:01 And it's a symbol that's actually shown in the cut scene where zero is in the warehouse
00:38:07 fighting against Sigma.
00:38:09 There is like these canisters that have this symbol on it.
00:38:12 And then that this thing that says warning virus has the exact same symbol.
00:38:16 So I guess into creates looked at that cut scene.
00:38:18 It was like, that's the symbol to indicate like computer virus or something to that
00:38:22 effect.
00:38:23 Wait, which game was the cut scene in?
00:38:25 X4.
00:38:26 When?
00:38:27 Oh, when the, the anime one, when they're.
00:38:29 Yeah.
00:38:30 When they're fighting.
00:38:31 Yeah.
00:38:32 There's a, there's a spot somewhere either during one of zero's flashbacks or when he's
00:38:36 fighting Sigma, whatever that is.
00:38:38 But there's a group of canisters and they have this little symbol on them.
00:38:42 And like it's just there.
00:38:44 Like there's a background thing.
00:38:45 Like you didn't mean anything.
00:38:47 But then I guess not retroactively.
00:38:50 Yeah.
00:38:51 I guess retroactively.
00:38:52 Yeah.
00:38:53 Yeah.
00:38:54 They, they, they picked that out and they said, Hey, what if this is the symbol for the
00:38:56 virus that was in?
00:38:57 Yeah.
00:38:58 Exactly.
00:38:59 So it's funny because it's cut content.
00:39:01 So you never actually see it, but it does.
00:39:04 It is there.
00:39:05 And so I'm saying like, well, it's cut content, but what was their intention?
00:39:08 You know, so.
00:39:09 Yeah.
00:39:10 Yeah.
00:39:11 Totally.
00:39:12 Oh, that's great.
00:39:13 There's just like little details, you know, there's like way too many of those.
00:39:16 You could get there.
00:39:17 They're like, they're all over, especially in the zero games.
00:39:20 And then I mean, yeah.
00:39:22 Oh, man, I've after I finished at some point, I realized that the in ZX, I think it's in
00:39:28 ZX one or two, like the body of high leg or a buckle is just kind of like buried under
00:39:33 some grass somewhere.
00:39:35 I have one even better for you in the woods.
00:39:37 Yeah.
00:39:38 For the entire, there's a lot of bosses actually.
00:39:40 I don't have screenshots of all of them.
00:39:42 The high leg or a buckle was just one that I in game.
00:39:44 I noticed was like, oh my God, it's high leg.
00:39:46 It's everybody's favorite suitoroid high leg or a buckle.
00:39:49 Yeah.
00:39:50 What's the name?
00:39:51 That's so easy to pronounce and remember.
00:39:52 I mean, it's memorable.
00:39:54 It's a memorable name once you get your head.
00:39:56 Oh, this one.
00:39:57 It's cucumber.
00:39:58 Right.
00:39:59 It's a wire sponge.
00:40:01 Wire sponge.
00:40:02 What the fuck?
00:40:04 So I always thought this was cool that he's like dead, but he's like fused in.
00:40:09 So this is the Tower of Vendir in ZX, which is like or ZX Advent, I should say.
00:40:15 And it's like a giant organic tree thing.
00:40:19 I think I don't know if this is growing out of area zero or if it's like near area zero.
00:40:23 But it's interesting because wire sponge was part of a like a weather control thing.
00:40:30 And there's like these weird gross like organic vines that can like grow out of his stage.
00:40:36 Like there's like things that they drop.
00:40:38 So this looks like if one of those like grew out of control and I guess his body was just like merged with it.
00:40:44 I don't know how he got stuck there because I mean like he got blown up and then you fight him again in the Sigma stages for or I guess the X Hunter stages for X2.
00:40:54 So how did he get here?
00:40:55 I don't understand, but I don't know what the implications of this are, but it's neat to speculate.
00:41:00 That's just news.
00:41:01 Hell.
00:41:02 That's just cool.
00:41:03 They love their references, man.
00:41:05 I'm telling you, it's all over the place for better or for worse.
00:41:07 Yeah.
00:41:10 I'm like appreciating.
00:41:12 I'm like appreciating the screenshots.
00:41:14 Oh my God.
00:41:15 This is so cool.
00:41:17 There's so much implied history here.
00:41:21 Yeah.
00:41:22 Speaking.
00:41:23 Oh, go ahead.
00:41:24 I just want to say I think I think unfortunately I think I got to say that I think the part where in the lecture where I talk about legends is a little bit slow.
00:41:31 I think like I think it was I think that's kind of maybe like the low point energy wise in the lecture because I think.
00:41:38 Yeah, I felt like there was a few moments when you were talking about Legends 2 that I realized I wasn't listening for like four times and I had to go back.
00:41:49 And I'm like, okay, let me actually pay attention.
00:41:52 Like what happened?
00:41:53 Like who?
00:41:54 It's because it's because it's because like that those games, even though they canonically take place in the future.
00:42:00 They're like they're very they feel very disconnected from the rest of it.
00:42:05 So there's not that much in the terms of like like connections to be made.
00:42:09 So there's actually a few that I wanted to mention, which I don't know if you knew these and couldn't fit them in because I know that for for Legends.
00:42:18 I didn't think that it was low energy so much as there wasn't a lot connecting other games, but there's a lot to cover.
00:42:25 So I know you were kind of like going over a lot of it.
00:42:27 Like you're and this is not that it was any less good.
00:42:31 It was just kind of like you have to just kind of speed through it because there's just so much.
00:42:34 I think I was kind of trying to speed through it.
00:42:37 Which makes sense because I mean the story is massive, but here's something that I was surprised that you didn't.
00:42:42 Right.
00:42:43 So there's so much more dialogue in the Legends games.
00:42:47 It's like it's kind of got to kind of got to summarize all this.
00:42:50 So connecting ZX to Legends, I'm surprised you didn't talk too much about this.
00:42:56 Alright.
00:42:57 In Legends, the Master runs Elysium, right?
00:43:01 Yeah.
00:43:02 This big tall blonde man who lives for however many years, 3,000 years or something like that.
00:43:07 The Sage Trinity made up of those three smart guys.
00:43:12 They're also called Masters.
00:43:15 There's Master Thomas, Master Albert, Master Mikai.
00:43:18 That's true.
00:43:19 That's true.
00:43:20 Yeah.
00:43:21 And on top of that, they are doing, I can't articulate it better than this because it's
00:43:28 not made very clear in the ending, but he's like something, something replates with human
00:43:33 bodies.
00:43:34 And what do you think we did with this and that?
00:43:37 And on top of that, Mega Man, or I should say Rock, Volnut, is called Mega Man Trigger,
00:43:45 right?
00:43:46 There's another Mega Man on Cadillacs Island called Mega Man Juno.
00:43:49 Yeah.
00:43:50 The people who use bio metals are also called Mega Man.
00:43:54 Yes.
00:43:55 It's like now a title.
00:43:57 Even more than that, it's only like brushed over really quickly.
00:44:00 You are not just a Mega Man, you are also named based on which bio metal that you're
00:44:06 using.
00:44:07 So if you're using Bio Metal Model Z, you are Mega Man Zero, you are Mega Man X, you
00:44:12 are Mega Man Thephnir, you are Mega Man Harpuia, Mega Man Phanta, Mega Man Leviathan.
00:44:17 So Mega Man has now become a title.
00:44:19 So there's not too much connecting them, but I mean, you got people called Masters who
00:44:25 are like, they rule over the society of people and kind of control, you know, human-reploid
00:44:33 relations as well as, you know, they have their own like backup of like human bodies
00:44:39 somewhere.
00:44:41 And then there's also the Mega Men who serve the Masters, just like how in Legends, the
00:44:46 Mega Men who work on the islands and things like that also serve the Masters.
00:44:51 So I think there's some sort of connection going on there too.
00:44:55 That's true and you put it like that.
00:44:57 And the kicker, which makes everyone kind of all their, everyone's brains explode, is
00:45:02 the very last thing that Thomas says is this world needs to be reset, which is not unlike
00:45:08 the Carbon Reinitialization Program, which will wipe out everyone on the planet and literally
00:45:13 reset the world.
00:45:14 It is like that.
00:45:16 So what they mean by this, I don't know, but I feel like I'm not saying they're like,
00:45:22 you can draw a straight line from ZX to Legends, but I'm saying that that seems to be laying
00:45:26 the groundwork for something that's going to come.
00:45:29 I think it's, yeah, you can, you could definitely hear that and be like, is, you know, he talks
00:45:36 about like he wants to like reset the world and create the next step in human evolution.
00:45:42 So is it, it's not, it's not that hard to imagine that he's talking about carbons or
00:45:48 the Anthro, uh, the Anthro units or pure humans or, uh, yeah, the stuff that becomes, yeah,
00:45:56 sure.
00:45:57 I found this out in my, uh, I have a series of three videos I did called History of Robotics
00:46:02 and Mega Man.
00:46:03 I watched those.
00:46:04 I watched those, of course.
00:46:07 I had a feeling because I heard you say a few things and I'm like, hey, I remember
00:46:10 I had, I watched a bunch of them and I, and I got enough from that I was like, I can't,
00:46:14 it's plagiarism.
00:46:15 If I just say these things, I have to, I have to shout, I have to shout this channel out
00:46:19 now.
00:46:20 I appreciate it.
00:46:21 Thank you.
00:46:22 I was very surprised when I saw that.
00:46:23 I was like, oh, wow, look at that.
00:46:24 I'm hitting the big leagues now.
00:46:25 I was, I was, you know, I was, I was, um, I was looking for like Mega Man videos on YouTube
00:46:30 to get like alternate perspective, like, you know, just to hear what's like, hear what's
00:46:34 in the zeitgeist, hear what's like word on the street.
00:46:37 So I, and I think I found your channel and I watched a bunch of your stuff.
00:46:41 Thank you.
00:46:42 I'm very flattered.
00:46:43 Yeah.
00:46:44 And in the end I was like, well, I got it.
00:46:46 I got some key, I got some keen insights from this, from this guy.
00:46:51 So got to let people know.
00:46:53 Oh, well, I really do appreciate it.
00:46:55 It means a lot to me.
00:46:56 I've been trying to share your video everywhere that I possibly can because it's great.
00:47:00 Thank you.
00:47:01 Um, I got to, I got to celebrate.
00:47:02 I got to celebrate.
00:47:03 I did last night, it did hit the milestone.
00:47:05 It did hit a hundred K views in its first week.
00:47:08 100 K views.
00:47:09 Nice.
00:47:10 That's crazy.
00:47:11 I wasn't sure if it was going to do that.
00:47:12 Uh, I'll say, I was going to, I told myself I was going to be happy if it hit a hundred
00:47:16 K views ever.
00:47:17 Like, I thought it was not going to do as well as my previous ones.
00:47:21 I was, I was going to say in the Mega Man, in the Mega Man circles, your video is getting
00:47:25 everywhere.
00:47:26 I've had like a thousand people be like, have you seen this video?
00:47:29 Is it going to be good?
00:47:30 Check it out.
00:47:31 It's going to be awesome.
00:47:32 So like everyone knows about it.
00:47:33 In the Mega Man community, like everyone does, like, and I'm super happy that they do because
00:47:37 it's amazing.
00:47:38 I don't want to be like the only guy that talks about Mega Man.
00:47:41 Um, some people have even complained they're like, he's the only one that talks about
00:47:44 blah, blah, blah.
00:47:45 I'm like, okay, but that's not my choice.
00:47:47 Like I'm not like, you know, like, like monopolizing it.
00:47:51 Everyone's free to do it.
00:47:52 It's just, I'm the only one who is.
00:47:53 So, um, I'm really happy that there's more people doing it and I'm more than happy to
00:47:57 collab with other YouTubers, you know, who want to talk about stuff.
00:48:01 So.
00:48:02 A lot of people keep, you know, every now and then I get a comment that's like, obviously
00:48:07 a lot of people are like, where's battle network, where's command mission, even though I explained
00:48:11 in the video.
00:48:12 I saw that.
00:48:13 But that, but that's okay.
00:48:14 But that's okay.
00:48:15 I get it.
00:48:16 Nobody read.
00:48:17 I get it.
00:48:18 Nobody pays attention.
00:48:19 It's fine.
00:48:20 Nobody reads the description and nobody pays attention to your opening statements.
00:48:21 Cause I do videos like who exactly is Mega Man and I give you like a 30 minute video
00:48:27 explaining the origins of Mega Man, his specifications, a buttload of trivia.
00:48:32 And then I still have that one jackass in the comments.
00:48:34 He's like, oh, you didn't talk about Mega Man EXE and I'm like, it's a different character.
00:48:38 Like, come on.
00:48:39 Cut me some slack here.
00:48:40 Hey, wait a second.
00:48:42 I'm sorry.
00:48:43 This is off topic.
00:48:44 I'm looking at that screenshot.
00:48:45 The wire spun screenshot.
00:48:46 Uh huh.
00:48:47 Okay.
00:48:48 You see that pillar.
00:48:49 Rewinding a bit.
00:48:50 You see that pillar in the background under the spike wall.
00:48:53 Yeah.
00:48:54 The angry face.
00:48:55 I'm sorry.
00:48:56 Is that Dr. Doppler?
00:48:57 I'm sorry.
00:48:58 It looks exactly like Dr. Doppler.
00:49:00 Yeah.
00:49:01 You know, you know what?
00:49:02 We found another reference.
00:49:05 It totally could be.
00:49:06 Like I'm not saying that it is, but I'm not putting it out.
00:49:09 I'm not saying it isn't because he's made up of nano machines and he's merged with everything.
00:49:13 So if anything is Maverick or evil, no, no, no, no, not Dr. Vi, although he does kind of
00:49:17 look like Dr. Vi.
00:49:18 I'm saying, oh, you know what?
00:49:19 You're right.
00:49:20 You're right.
00:49:21 I think it looks more like him.
00:49:22 You're right.
00:49:23 I got it mixed up.
00:49:24 You're totally right.
00:49:25 It has to be.
00:49:26 Who else could it be?
00:49:27 Yeah.
00:49:28 It's literally the only thing that makes sense.
00:49:34 It's literally the only rational explanation.
00:49:37 Yeah.
00:49:38 If you deny it.
00:49:39 I used to think Dr. Vi'll, or I always say Vi'll just to make sure that I don't confuse
00:49:44 him with Vi'll, the bad guy robot remix.
00:49:47 Yeah.
00:49:48 I said, I said wheel.
00:49:51 I used to say wheel.
00:49:52 I used to say wheel too.
00:49:54 And then people were like, no, it's supposed to be Vi'll because that's his name in Japanese.
00:49:58 I'm like, I know that's his name in Japanese, but I'm saying while because that's how it
00:50:02 looks like it should be pronounced.
00:50:03 So now I had some people say, I had some people say while now, I had some people say that
00:50:08 in German, it might be, it might be either Vi'll or some have said that it might be
00:50:14 Ville.
00:50:15 Yeah.
00:50:16 And unfortunately it's it's hard.
00:50:20 You can't even reference the original Japanese pronunciation to be like, well, what is it
00:50:25 supposed to be?
00:50:26 Because it's a totally different name.
00:50:29 Yeah.
00:50:30 That's kind of like the whole ballad or belayed.
00:50:32 I always go with ballad because in Japanese, I think his name is like Barado or something
00:50:36 like that.
00:50:37 Like it's got the, it's, it's a, what's the word I'm looking for?
00:50:42 The short a.
00:50:43 Yeah.
00:50:44 Yeah.
00:50:45 So that's why I always say ballad makes, I had a lot of keyboard warriors in the comments
00:50:49 slamming on their keys, like, no, you idiot pronouncing wrong.
00:50:51 I'm like, all right, sorry, dude, I'm too busy knowing everything else about Mega Man.
00:50:55 So remember here to pronounce his name, right?
00:50:58 You just got to pronounce it really wrong because it's going billiards or whatever.
00:51:01 Yeah.
00:51:02 You gotta do Billiards would be a cool name for a robot actually.
00:51:05 Honestly, what would have gotten the video even more views is if I just deliberately
00:51:10 pronounced all the names wrong because people can't help like, like, um, you get so much
00:51:15 interaction.
00:51:16 Welcome to my Megaman lecture.
00:51:17 Megaman, Pokemon, Pokemon YouTubers and like Nuzlocke, like FlygonHG does it all the time.
00:51:22 He like pronounces Pokemon's names wrong on purpose all the time.
00:51:26 Like, uh, uh, uh, like he calls Magnemite, Magnemite, and he calls Ninetales, Nenaytales
00:51:33 and stuff like that.
00:51:34 And I think he's doing it as a joke, but I'm sure it has the side effect of like,
00:51:38 Rattata.
00:51:39 Um, people just can't help but be like, he said, um, he said, uh,
00:51:47 Yeah.
00:51:48 He, why, why did he pronounce it Lucario?
00:51:50 Why did he say it like that?
00:51:51 Yeah.
00:51:52 I, I have to admit, um, I don't think I've ever done anything that egregious, um, but
00:51:57 I have absolutely said things that like, for instance, I saw you, you mentioned this.
00:52:03 There was a theory that saying like the star droids might not actually be aliens.
00:52:08 And don't get me wrong.
00:52:09 I did consider like, you know, maybe that is a possibility, but I purposely didn't double
00:52:13 back to say that, you know, like, no, they probably are aliens.
00:52:16 I think that's, that's what their intention was only because I knew it was going to get
00:52:20 people to comment and be like, they absolutely are aliens.
00:52:24 So it's, it's, it's kind of cheated a little bit, but I got a lot of engagement out of
00:52:28 it.
00:52:29 So I mean, what can I say?
00:52:30 I think, um, I didn't, I didn't set out deliberately to say anything wrong for engagement, but like,
00:52:36 I think the fact that my video is eight hours long and I say so many things, like I'm surely
00:52:40 I'll, I'll leave stuff out or probably get things wrong here and there.
00:52:44 Uh, and I think you did fantastic though.
00:52:47 Like honestly, all things considered, and I'm telling you as someone who I don't want
00:52:50 to say it's my job because I don't do YouTube as a job, but okay, um, as someone who spends
00:52:55 every single day basically looking into and examining Mega Man lore and history, um, you
00:53:01 did a fantastic job and I honestly don't think anyone could fault you given the size and
00:53:07 scope of your video for leaving anything out.
00:53:10 Like I thought you'd agree.
00:53:11 Anything that you left out, I didn't assume it was left out because of, um, like ignorance
00:53:17 and I figured you left it out because of time because honestly, like it's huge.
00:53:21 Well I think it's like you said, even if I did, um, even if I didn't get anything like
00:53:26 straight up wrong, there's always going to be things that like someone else interpreted
00:53:30 something differently or someone else or there, or there's vagueness in the interpretation
00:53:34 and it's like, well, someone's going to think something different.
00:53:38 But as a result of that, um, the video has gotten, it's got like for its view count,
00:53:43 um, it's gotten, it's gotten like a thousand comments, which is a lot, which is a lot for
00:53:48 a hundred K views.
00:53:49 Like I have videos that have like, I have a couple of the other lectures have like two
00:53:52 hundred K views and they don't have two thousand comments.
00:53:55 They have like eight hundred comments, nine hundred comments.
00:53:59 Right.
00:54:00 So I think, I think, uh, this is very, very active comment section on this one, which
00:54:03 supposedly, uh, which is great.
00:54:06 Yeah.
00:54:07 I'm already getting pulled into arguments in your comment section.
00:54:11 I left.
00:54:12 I'm sorry.
00:54:13 No, it's okay.
00:54:14 I'm not like actually like.
00:54:15 I have not been looking at my comments.
00:54:17 I know I said I would answer comments in the video and I, and I will go through them at
00:54:20 some point, but there's too many and I haven't like gone through them and like tried to answer
00:54:24 people's, uh, questions except for like one or two here and there.
00:54:28 Right.
00:54:29 It's just like, um, so I referenced, um, in, in one of my comments, I was like something,
00:54:35 Dr. Wilde or, uh, or whatever his name is, uh, love Lava lamp, man, um, he in, in X dive,
00:54:44 they have character bios that they release every once in a while and the character bios
00:54:48 as far as I can tell contain cannon information because I've actually been able to cross reference
00:54:52 it with other sources.
00:54:54 So it's like, oh cool.
00:54:55 So X dive itself, we all know is not cannon because it's, it's, it's literally a game
00:55:01 playing off of your nostalgia.
00:55:02 Like within the opening.
00:55:04 I was so relieved to discover that it's definitely not cannon because I'm like, this seems
00:55:08 like there's like an amount of content and it's, it's clearly just them having fun.
00:55:14 They're just like, Hey, remember when you used to play video games all night and did
00:55:17 this?
00:55:18 I'm like, okay.
00:55:19 So they're acknowledging that Mega Man is just a video game series and like it's not
00:55:23 right.
00:55:24 It isn't the story.
00:55:25 The story of X dive is that you, you basically play yourself, but like going into the computer
00:55:30 to like fix old Mega Man data.
00:55:33 You're fixing, you're fixing data.
00:55:34 You're fixing the memories of Mega Man, which is stored in a giant computer called the deep
00:55:40 log, which is the most unfortunate name for a computer ever log wall.
00:55:44 So it's basically, so it's basically an excuse.
00:55:46 It's basically an excuse to play through a bunch of like, what if like alternate Mega
00:55:50 Man scenarios with the goal of like fixing them.
00:55:53 Yeah.
00:55:54 They're just throwing cannon out the window to have fun crossovers and whatever.
00:55:58 And I'm like, I'm all for it because, you know, it's people are like, it's nostalgia
00:56:02 pandering.
00:56:03 And I'm like, yeah, you're just having fun.
00:56:05 It's not a serious game.
00:56:06 You know, it's not meant to be taken seriously.
00:56:08 Sounds like it might be fun.
00:56:09 I like, you can, you can argue like, oh, it's predatory because it's gotcha or whatever.
00:56:14 I'm like, all right, fine, but like just don't spend your money then.
00:56:17 Yeah.
00:56:18 Like I stopped playing, but even if I stopped playing, I'm still enjoying just looking at
00:56:22 the new character designs and models as they come out.
00:56:25 So like, I mean, I'm loving it, even though I'm not even actively playing in it.
00:56:29 I love the game, but, you know,
00:56:32 all this to just to mention that I mentioned that Dr.
00:56:34 Wild thing and people were slamming me in the responses because they're like, really,
00:56:38 you're going to accept X dive as canon, that that piece of crap game
00:56:42 that's all about milking you for money.
00:56:45 I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, chill, dude.
00:56:47 Like I'm not saying the story of X dive is canon.
00:56:49 I'm just saying that if all their other character bios are canon because I've been
00:56:55 able to reference them with other sources, why would Dr.
00:56:58 Wild's bio not be canon, you know, even though it's giving us new info?
00:57:02 I feel like that makes sense.
00:57:05 I. Yeah.
00:57:06 Because like, why would he be the one exception?
00:57:08 Like all the other bios are canonically accurate and there's sources for them,
00:57:12 except for his like, come on, like really?
00:57:16 I mean, you could maybe you could try to be like, oh, it's a different studio.
00:57:20 But like, Inti Creates is a different studio than the one.
00:57:23 But it's not a different studio anymore.
00:57:24 Or at least I don't think it is.
00:57:25 I think is it not.
00:57:27 It used to be Capcom, Taiwan.
00:57:28 But as I recall, I believe Capcom, Japan resumed development of it.
00:57:33 But so like, I think Capcom, Taiwan is Inti Creates made zero.
00:57:37 And I'm saying that it's not.
00:57:38 Oh, yeah. Inti Creates didn't make X dive.
00:57:41 So I mean, I guess you could say that, but like, that's dumb.
00:57:44 So never mind.
00:57:44 It's it's owned by Capcom.
00:57:46 So, you know what I mean?
00:57:47 Like Capcom owns the IP and even though they gave
00:57:50 Inti Creates the permission to make whatever story they wanted,
00:57:54 ultimately, Capcom still holds the reins so they can change it
00:57:57 to be whatever the hell they want it to be.
00:57:59 So, yeah, you know, so that is just the thing I'm putting out there.
00:58:02 I there was something else I was going to go off on.
00:58:04 I can't remember. But anyway, I just wanted to say, please don't attack me
00:58:07 for using X dive as a source. I'm sorry.
00:58:10 There's a lot of useful information in that game, even though the game itself is not can.
00:58:14 And I feel like that makes perfect sense.
00:58:17 That makes sense to me.
00:58:18 Like I learned another neat fact about X's armors.
00:58:21 Yeah.
00:58:22 So this was something that was only speculated on, but it was recently confirmed.
00:58:28 So everyone's always like, what happens to X's armors between games?
00:58:32 Why does he lose his armors between the games?
00:58:36 So originally, there was a quote from a developer somewhere for X4
00:58:40 where they're like, this isn't canon, this is just our personal idea.
00:58:43 But we think that X doesn't like holding onto weapons of war.
00:58:47 He only uses them when he needs to.
00:58:48 So that's why your weapons go away.
00:58:50 He's like, I don't need these anymore.
00:58:51 I'm going to get rid of them.
00:58:52 But they're still stored somewhere because in X5, he has some on the back.
00:58:57 Yeah, when you fight zero, he uses some of the X4 weapons.
00:59:01 But where did the armors go?
00:59:03 So there's actually another again, it's on the back of a milk carton somewhere.
00:59:09 It's in a newspaper, not newspaper, excuse me, magazine.
00:59:14 I think one of the Dysocon guides where for X2, it says that X found
00:59:19 another light capsule after he had the full armor and he stepped into the capsule
00:59:24 and it unequipped it from him where Dr.
00:59:27 Light then studied the armor and then developed the second armor from it,
00:59:34 which is why the first armor is not actually called the light armor.
00:59:37 That's like a fan name.
00:59:38 It's actually just called the first armor.
00:59:40 Second armor is also not called the Giga armor.
00:59:43 It's actually called the second armor officially.
00:59:46 And so everyone's like, OK, well, that explains that one.
00:59:48 But where's the third armor come from?
00:59:49 So Xdive, when they were doing a showcase of the third armor as a character
00:59:54 when it came out, they mentioned just like previously,
00:59:58 he turned in the second armor to a light capsule.
01:00:02 And then he studied the battle data from that and then developed
01:00:05 the third armor from that, which totally tracks because.
01:00:08 Makes sense.
01:00:09 In X1, you get the dash.
01:00:11 In X2, you get the air dash.
01:00:13 In X3, you get like the vertical dash on top of that.
01:00:16 In X2, you get like the double charge shot.
01:00:19 And then in X3, you get like an even bigger double charge shot.
01:00:21 So like, obviously, it's like an increment of what it's working on.
01:00:24 And then, of course, in X4, there's like, we don't actually know
01:00:28 what he did with the third armor because there's nothing no one said anything.
01:00:30 But it can be presumed that because they're all named first, second,
01:00:35 third, and then finally fourth, that he turned in the armor for the third one.
01:00:39 And like it got developed into the fourth one, which also increments.
01:00:43 I read somewhere that fourth armor was a mistranslation of force armor.
01:00:48 No, it's actually not a mistranslation.
01:00:50 In Japanese, it would be pronounced and spelled the exact same way,
01:00:53 which is why people were saying force.
01:00:57 You could technically translate it as both fourth and force.
01:01:03 But given that the previous three armors are first, second, and third,
01:01:08 fourth is the one that makes sense.
01:01:11 I guess I didn't I didn't realize that
01:01:12 because they don't actually like say they're they don't actually like call them
01:01:15 that anywhere, like they don't they're not really named in X one through three.
01:01:19 They're they don't get them.
01:01:21 Yeah, they don't mention the names of them in game.
01:01:23 The names of them come from other sources, of course.
01:01:27 It's always like a random source.
01:01:31 Another another weird wrench that they threw into it for some reason
01:01:34 is that for X3 for a while, even though it's the third armor,
01:01:37 they kept calling it the Max Armor and it's not the Max Armor.
01:01:42 Because as it turns out, again, I love my because Mac died.
01:01:46 Obviously, you killed Mac.
01:01:47 It's not Mac's armor.
01:01:49 He's dead. You can't just wait to lose his body.
01:01:51 It's stupid. It's ridiculous.
01:01:53 No, but I can't tell if you're joking.
01:01:57 Mac is X's best friend.
01:02:00 X's best friend of many years, his long time friend and compatriot.
01:02:03 Oh, it's great.
01:02:06 How cool of fate this is for to follow you yet.
01:02:09 I think I think I think you I think in you, your video about
01:02:15 like, how would you rewrite the story of X to give to give?
01:02:18 You would give Mac more of a but you would give him more backstory.
01:02:21 So when he betrays you, it actually means something.
01:02:24 I think I think I was riffing on that when in the in the in the lecture.
01:02:28 I make I make I make a joke about.
01:02:29 Oh, yeah, your close personal friend and confidant Mac.
01:02:33 Yeah, I mean, even if even if you weren't riffing on that,
01:02:36 you absolutely hit the nail on the head because that's how everyone feels.
01:02:39 There's been a long running joke between me and my buddy, Colman,
01:02:42 where every time someone mentions Mac, we're like, who?
01:02:44 Like, we just pretend we don't know who he is.
01:02:46 Never, never heard of him, which I'm going to call it.
01:02:50 Before I lose the weight, my train of thought, Max Armor.
01:02:54 Max Armor isn't the name of the armor.
01:02:55 It refers to having all of the armor parts.
01:02:58 And the reason why I know this is because
01:03:02 when they did the Mega Man Bandai Mega Armor series model kits,
01:03:07 the third armor was called Max Armor.
01:03:09 And what they really mean is full armor, because it was the only model kit
01:03:14 of the armor they had at the time.
01:03:16 So Max Armor was referring to the full set of armor.
01:03:19 And then there was other toys, which reference a full set of armor
01:03:23 for the X one and X two armors, and they also call it Max Armor.
01:03:27 So Max Armor refers to all the armor pieces, not understanding.
01:03:32 But everyone just kind of adopted it as like the name.
01:03:36 Do they say it in the game?
01:03:37 Like, like, does it show on a display somewhere that like when you've got all
01:03:40 the pieces, it's called, it says, oh, you've Max, you've Max on it.
01:03:43 OK, it does not.
01:03:44 It's literally just part of like, merchandise material.
01:03:47 It's like on a box, like for the model kit somewhere.
01:03:49 Like, that's it. That's all it is. So that makes sense.
01:03:52 But that's the reason I'm glad I cleared that up.
01:03:55 Because for years, I was like, yeah, the third armor is called the Max Armor
01:03:57 because in X four, it's called the Force Armor.
01:04:00 And then in X five, they got the Falcon and Chet.
01:04:02 But no, it's actually first, second, third, fourth.
01:04:05 And then X five and onwards, they start giving them names.
01:04:08 Yeah, because because they start being more than one in the game
01:04:11 and you got to like switch between them. Yeah, exactly.
01:04:14 So that's that's what was going on with that.
01:04:17 Yeah, uh, where should I apologize?
01:04:21 By the way, I feel like I don't mean to ramble as much as I do.
01:04:24 I have a show for that called Ramblin Reploids.
01:04:26 This is this is but I apologize.
01:04:28 I get passionate about about Mega Man and it just flows out of me.
01:04:32 I'm possessed by the spirit of X, you know.
01:04:36 Uh, I wait, I feel like I was going to say, oh, I was on the subject of the.
01:04:43 Oh, you said you Gibbs, you said you made it to the legends.
01:04:46 And I said the legends is a bit of an energy low point.
01:04:48 I just wanted to say that I think I to me in my opinion, the video picks up
01:04:54 energy around the time I'm getting to X around the time that I go on
01:04:58 like a big rant about how much I hate Repliforce.
01:05:02 I feel like that's I feel like that's kind of when I hit my stride.
01:05:07 I think you.
01:05:08 Yeah, because I think not only that, because like you, like you said,
01:05:11 legends is so disconnected from so many things, unless you know, like, where to look.
01:05:16 But I was really, I was really enjoying how unapologetically against Repliforce you are.
01:05:25 Yeah, I felt like it's more interesting if I like.
01:05:30 I feel like it's more interesting if I take a hard line
01:05:32 and I'm like everyone's very waffly about whether or not Repliforce is.
01:05:36 I mean, and I like you can tell you can tell in the game they were going for
01:05:40 like a sort of morally gray both sides are both sides are sympathetic conflict.
01:05:46 Like so they're so they're they're both they're both right and wrong.
01:05:51 Like so Repliforce is wrong for just being like, hey, man,
01:05:55 all your all of your robots are at the scene of the crime.
01:05:58 Can we like talk about this?
01:05:59 And they're like, how dare you?
01:06:02 I'm afraid we can't talk about this.
01:06:04 Yeah, just launch a full on war.
01:06:08 And then the Maverick Hunters not really X or zero necessarily.
01:06:12 But I guess I guess society is the problem because they're so quick
01:06:17 to label anyone who doesn't fall into lockstep as a Maverick.
01:06:20 So you could argue that Repliforce knows that no matter what's going to happen,
01:06:25 they're just going to be labeled Mavericks anyway.
01:06:27 So maybe they figured like we got no other choice may as well throw a revolution
01:06:31 right now, you know, I guess. Yeah.
01:06:34 Yeah, that's always been my argument is like Repliforce knows.
01:06:39 I guess it didn't really consider it from that angle.
01:06:41 But yeah, Maverick Hunters, if yeah.
01:06:46 They're they're quick to they're quick to call people.
01:06:49 If I guess it is they are the ones who are like, well, we've got to we've got to declare.
01:06:55 I guess they sort of start the conflict by declaring them Mavericks in the first place.
01:07:00 Yeah, I mean, I see that.
01:07:01 Yeah, I mean, X X or zero did their best.
01:07:03 They're like, listen, if you don't cooperate with us, you are going to be labeled as Mavericks,
01:07:07 which, you know, right is not only is it like, yes, that's the logical thing to do
01:07:13 because they're at the scene of a gigantic terrorist attack
01:07:16 and are basically refusing to cooperate with you.
01:07:19 But also it kind of speaks to the fact that like anyone can be labeled a Maverick,
01:07:24 you know, like it kind of does, you know what I mean?
01:07:27 Like I've always had the idea that as time goes on leading up to X for an X five ish,
01:07:35 I guess even all the way into X seven, that the Maverick Hunters are slowly becoming
01:07:39 like the judges from like Judge Dredd, like if someone doesn't obey you
01:07:44 or doesn't does anything to even slightly look at humanity the wrong way, you're a Maverick.
01:07:49 You know, by the I by the I mean by by X, but by zero,
01:07:55 like that's zero is like the logical conclusion of that progression.
01:08:00 Exactly, where the finally the Reploids were never equals.
01:08:04 They just finally it's like the true colors are shown where it's like, OK,
01:08:08 we don't trust Reploids, we're going to subjugate the crap out of them.
01:08:12 And if anyone disagrees with that, you're a Maverick,
01:08:15 whether you're a human or Reploid alike, it doesn't matter.
01:08:18 So it kind of goes to show how like the term Maverick can, you know,
01:08:24 it's not it's not really just it really just means whatever you think it means.
01:08:28 Yeah, it goes from it's not like the word criminal where it's like this person,
01:08:32 you know, committed a crime and they've been like convicted or something like that.
01:08:37 It's more specific than that.
01:08:39 Right. Maverick is just kind of like, hey, buddy, you're acting a little funny
01:08:43 or like, hey, man, you made some anti human remark before.
01:08:47 And I'm not sure I trust you anymore.
01:08:48 And so you can kind of see how it's like a slippery slope.
01:08:52 Once you kind of like start on it, you know, they're so they're they're basically
01:08:56 getting canceled for tweets, yes, human tweets, except instead of getting canceled,
01:09:01 you can blast it in the head.
01:09:03 They send they send the they send the cops.
01:09:06 Yeah, the robot, the robot police as they were almost called.
01:09:10 Yeah, they I mean, they pretty much they pretty much are the robot police.
01:09:14 Yeah, they were almost called that like in early drafts for the game.
01:09:18 They were called the robot police.
01:09:20 Maverick countries is cooler.
01:09:22 It is way cooler.
01:09:23 But I guess it all it kind of comes to the same thing.
01:09:28 Everyone I don't like is a Maverick.
01:09:32 Yeah, that's how it is, though.
01:09:33 That's what that's all this whole deal that really is.
01:09:37 Like, no, you know, Zero's line in Zero's line in Zero Three,
01:09:43 when he tells Vile, like you you sound like the Maverick.
01:09:46 Like, yeah, you're like you're like the king of the humans and like you're
01:09:49 persecuting everyone and then you call them reploids and then have them retired.
01:09:53 But like, you're you're the one that sounds like the Maverick,
01:09:56 like for being such a desperate for being such a such a just a psychopath about it.
01:10:02 I think who's who's the real Maverick here?
01:10:05 What a game. Exactly.
01:10:06 It is. I think I have some problems with indecorates storytelling
01:10:12 because in the games themselves, it's a fantastic quadrilogy of games.
01:10:17 But there's lots of other like minor details, which makes like a lore nut
01:10:21 like me, like lose my mind because certain things just don't add up.
01:10:23 But I won't get into those now because we'll be on.
01:10:25 No, I can think of one. I can think of one or two.
01:10:28 Yeah, there's definitely a handful.
01:10:31 But I do think it is beautiful in that
01:10:34 you can kind of see how the term Maverick gets applied more and more liberally
01:10:39 throughout the series until finally it reaches a point where humans are like,
01:10:42 yeah, we don't trust you, which sucks, because as you mentioned,
01:10:46 there was a point where X was like kind of like ruler of the rest of the world
01:10:50 for a little bit and everything was like cool and sweet and everyone
01:10:53 was like singing Kumbaya and it was awesome. Yeah, definitely.
01:10:57 And then and then Dr.
01:10:59 Dr. Weil is like, how about no?
01:11:02 And he he like actually I don't know if you mentioned it,
01:11:05 but it is part of the story, which, again, is not explicitly stated in the games.
01:11:10 I don't think he manufactured Mavericks to attack places
01:11:15 after X's. So they're OK. Let me know.
01:11:18 I didn't. I don't even remember that.
01:11:21 OK, so this is again, this is this is why I say I don't like
01:11:24 intercreates is storytelling, because there's lots of key details,
01:11:28 which contextualize a lot of things, which are just not in the games.
01:11:32 That's no, that's definitely true.
01:11:34 Like the fact that I had to go and listen and listen and listen to it.
01:11:38 But like there's you have to listen to the audio drama
01:11:40 to know who like where El Piso comes from and why he has the baby elves.
01:11:45 Yes. So this is actually about the baby elves.
01:11:49 Dr. Weil develops the mother elf with
01:11:53 Ciel's great grandmother or whoever the hell she is.
01:11:55 I'm going to I'm just going to call her Alia.
01:11:57 It's Alia. I'm just going to say it.
01:11:58 We're just going to go ahead and say it's Alia.
01:12:00 All right. He's developing the mother elf.
01:12:02 I mean, just because that's what I choose to believe.
01:12:04 I think it. I think it. Yeah.
01:12:07 Why not? Why not? Why not?
01:12:08 They got the same hair. They got the same color eyes.
01:12:11 They're both pink, whatever.
01:12:13 So he develops the mother elf and
01:12:18 wisely, the human government of the time of the world.
01:12:21 We'll just say the world governments are like,
01:12:26 how are you going to use this thing?
01:12:28 So everyone kind of submits their own ideas for how they're going to use
01:12:31 this reality bending digital deity that they've created.
01:12:36 And X says we should use it for its intended purpose
01:12:39 and just remove the sigma virus from the world.
01:12:42 And if any other viruses ever come up,
01:12:45 we'll just use it again to get rid of them.
01:12:46 And that is the only thing we ever use it for.
01:12:51 The moderate position.
01:12:52 Yeah, he's like, that is the only thing we use it for.
01:12:54 It is only it was designed to stop viruses.
01:12:56 We only use it to stop viruses.
01:12:59 And Dr.
01:12:59 Wila was like, well, actually,
01:13:02 Reploids are the cause of literally all the conflict in the world.
01:13:05 And I can't say that he's wrong.
01:13:07 Like he's kind of right.
01:13:08 So he's like, instead of using it to get rid of the viruses,
01:13:12 number one, we get rid of the virus.
01:13:14 And number two, we then use it to mind control all Reploids
01:13:18 and revoke their free will so that we control what they do in the world.
01:13:23 And so there's no way I did read this.
01:13:25 Yeah, this rings a bell.
01:13:27 So he he wants to control all Reploids.
01:13:31 In the end, everyone, you know, is like, I don't know, that sounds kind of evil.
01:13:36 And so so they go with X's plan and they're like, OK, so X,
01:13:39 we're going to go with your plan.
01:13:41 And I forget how they do this exactly because I thought they needed
01:13:44 zero's original body to control the mother elf.
01:13:46 But I don't know if Omega is a thing at this point, but either way,
01:13:50 the point is they do erase the Maverick virus and or Sigma from the world.
01:13:55 And then everything is happy and great and everyone loves it.
01:13:59 So Dr.
01:13:59 Wila's like, well, you know, I don't like that.
01:14:02 I think my plan is the right plan.
01:14:04 So he goes and makes two copies of the mother elf, which are the baby elves.
01:14:09 And then when he has those,
01:14:10 he uses them to start manufacturing Maverick uprisings,
01:14:15 basically mind controlling Reploids to go and commit crimes.
01:14:19 So he's like, see, look, like the giving Reploids their free will.
01:14:23 It doesn't solve anything.
01:14:25 They're going to always rebel against humanity.
01:14:26 It's evil. We got to control them.
01:14:28 And so the government.
01:14:30 I feel like there are parallels to be made to the real world here.
01:14:35 Yeah.
01:14:36 So he's like, see, I've manufactured a crisis, although no one knows that.
01:14:42 And therefore you should give me control of the mother elf.
01:14:45 And I'm going to enact my version of the plan.
01:14:47 And so the human governments are like, and he also it's briefly mentioned,
01:14:51 but he did have conspirators like on the inside that helped him.
01:14:54 And so they were like, OK, we're going to go ahead and give you
01:14:58 Zero's original body to control the mother elf and do whatever it is you want with it.
01:15:02 And that's where Omega comes into play and gets put into Zero's body.
01:15:06 And then also how he controls the mother elf and means.
01:15:10 Yeah, no, no, go on, go on.
01:15:11 So and so basically once he has the mother elf, he's like, Tee he, I'm just kidding.
01:15:16 I'm not going to just control all the Reploids.
01:15:19 I am also going to wage war on the entire planet and just rule it
01:15:23 because I am a power hungry, crazy person inside of a lava lamp.
01:15:26 It makes it makes perfect sense.
01:15:28 If that's where if only it were actually in the game.
01:15:32 Yeah, exactly.
01:15:34 And so that's where the elf wars come in.
01:15:36 And that's why they were so devastating, because they were literally
01:15:40 waging war, not not just with the mother elf, but the other sides were fighting
01:15:44 with their own cyber elves that were developed from the mother elf.
01:15:49 And so each side is lobbying these reality bending super weapons at each other.
01:15:54 You know, and just I mean, that must have been one hell of a battle.
01:15:58 Like there's literally a cyber elf that can turn people into metools.
01:16:01 Like, could you imagine like one day you're just a soldier on the field,
01:16:04 you're shooting at guys, you're dipping and ducking through trenches.
01:16:07 And then all of a sudden you just become a metal.
01:16:10 Well, yeah.
01:16:11 So so that's that's basically what happened.
01:16:14 And then so X is fighting back and he's like, this is ridiculous.
01:16:20 Holy crap, how did you guys let this happen?
01:16:22 And so that's when they wake up zero and put him inside of that copy body.
01:16:26 And then he he fights back with X.
01:16:29 They defeat Dr. Wilde and Omega.
01:16:32 And then that's when everyone's like, OK, X, you were right the first time.
01:16:35 We're really sorry.
01:16:37 You just you rule the world at this point, because we know that you're good
01:16:40 and pure and you're the best little cupcake out there.
01:16:45 And so then he does.
01:16:46 And then everyone is happy and everything's perfect for a little while.
01:16:50 It does make sense.
01:16:51 I think I was a little I was a little fuzzy on some of the details of how it
01:16:54 shook out and it is it's there.
01:16:57 This is this is from like the drama CDs, right?
01:16:59 Yeah, it's like drama CDs, external sources, like the art books.
01:17:03 A lot of this is in official complete works.
01:17:05 A lot of it is also on the now defunct, although I guess still considered canon.
01:17:10 Mega Min zero collection, official timeline website,
01:17:14 the official timeline they had on their thing.
01:17:16 Yeah. So that's basically how that happened.
01:17:21 So yeah, everyone's like, yeah, we screwed up X. We're sorry.
01:17:23 And that's why instead of just killing, yeah, instead of just killing
01:17:27 why, like they should have, they were like, what you have done is so bad
01:17:31 that we're going to punish you harder than just killing you.
01:17:34 We're going to try to make you suffer every single day.
01:17:37 And this will absolutely not bite us in the ass.
01:17:40 I understand the sentiment, but I don't think it was maybe the the optimal play.
01:17:46 Yeah, it was.
01:17:46 And that was the thing that apparently was like kept secret
01:17:49 because like they knew that it was illegal and they shouldn't have been.
01:17:52 They should like it was supposed to be that highly illegal.
01:17:55 So and that's why like when you were saying he comes back and copy X mark,
01:17:59 too, is like, well, it wasn't an illegal exile.
01:18:01 It wasn't illegal exile.
01:18:02 They did it wrong.
01:18:03 They didn't follow the correct procedures.
01:18:05 It's fine, guys.
01:18:06 Like I think he basically like says exactly that.
01:18:08 He's like, yeah, I didn't follow the rules.
01:18:10 No, they did it.
01:18:11 They did it sneaky.
01:18:12 None of that didn't count.
01:18:13 Didn't didn't count.
01:18:14 We give him another chance.
01:18:18 Kiwi Hermans's way.
01:18:19 Yes.
01:18:20 Into power.
01:18:21 Stands up in the town hall.
01:18:22 Yes.
01:18:23 My name is Dr.
01:18:24 Leuve and, you know, like Mr.
01:18:28 Mr. Burns doing that.
01:18:29 I'm I'm Mr.
01:18:30 Snrubb.
01:18:31 He's just like he's got a fake mustache on his lava
01:18:34 length, lava, lava, lava.
01:18:36 Yeah, exactly.
01:18:37 I think I think it was not according to protocol
01:18:41 that Dr.
01:18:42 Vile was exiled.
01:18:43 So we should we should give him another chance.
01:18:46 Exactly.
01:18:46 It was totally and you know what?
01:18:49 I mentioned this.
01:18:50 I have like a meme video I did.
01:18:51 It was like I summarized the entire Mega Man
01:18:53 timeline in like 18 minutes.
01:18:54 It's just me screwing around.
01:18:56 But there's a there's a part where I mentioned
01:18:58 I'm like the four guardians are a bunch of
01:19:00 dumbasses for letting this happen.
01:19:01 And I'm like, yeah, they really are.
01:19:02 Like like I know I was joking, but they really
01:19:05 are dumbasses for because they were they were around.
01:19:08 They were around.
01:19:09 They were around for watching because when
01:19:11 Copy X was made, that's when they were made as well.
01:19:13 So like Copy X and the four guardians were built
01:19:15 around like the same time.
01:19:17 I don't know which ones came first, but the point
01:19:18 is is around the same time.
01:19:20 So they got to watch Copy X rule like a toddler
01:19:23 over all of human civilization.
01:19:26 And he's just like, there's an energy crisis.
01:19:28 Replies use energy.
01:19:30 Replies aren't allowed to get any more energy.
01:19:32 And instead of any of them raising their hand
01:19:34 and being like brilliant, brilliant, sir,
01:19:37 I think there might be a problem with that solution.
01:19:39 They were just like, yes, of course, your highness
01:19:41 and just let it go.
01:19:43 And I'm like, you know, I feel like at any time
01:19:44 they could have stepped in to solve this
01:19:46 if they just used like their brain a little bit.
01:19:49 Like why would you make them perfectly loyal to Copy X?
01:19:52 They said, yes, sir.
01:19:54 Mr. X, sir, you're saving humanity.
01:19:58 You know, I'm so glad you bought Twitter.
01:20:01 You know, you're saving the world.
01:20:06 You know, your self-driving cars are really good.
01:20:09 Copy X is like we're going to put people on Mars
01:20:12 or something like that.
01:20:14 Yeah.
01:20:16 He's building the orbital elevator.
01:20:18 Actually, I was going to mention,
01:20:21 Mega Man Zero does have orbital elevators.
01:20:23 It's not remarked upon, but they are there.
01:20:25 There's lots of orbital elevators
01:20:27 all throughout the Zero series.
01:20:30 As a matter of fact, I think in-
01:20:32 I know in Neo Arcadia, like in one of the endings,
01:20:35 you climb up a big tower.
01:20:37 Yeah, that's where you go and get.
01:20:40 You actually go in one.
01:20:41 No, three.
01:20:42 In Zero One as well.
01:20:45 I think that's area X, where you fight X.
01:20:48 It's you actually fight him.
01:20:51 You go through like a big elevator area.
01:20:52 I have a picture of it.
01:20:53 Hang on.
01:20:54 I do remember climbing a big tower.
01:20:57 I wasn't...
01:20:58 Yeah, you kind of do like sort of end up like in space.
01:21:02 Yeah, you end up in space somewhere.
01:21:05 Or at least like really, really high up
01:21:07 and you can see the...
01:21:09 Yeah, you know, I remember that.
01:21:11 I remember that and they don't really even remark upon it
01:21:13 other than that.
01:21:14 They don't talk about it much.
01:21:14 It's just a really high tower.
01:21:15 But it is there.
01:21:18 Oh, come on, where the hell is it?
01:21:19 I got pictures of it or in here somewhere.
01:21:21 Is it in this one?
01:21:22 I gotta say, before we go on with any more of that,
01:21:27 I just wanna say that I had a happy Thanksgiving
01:21:33 and I hope everybody had a happy Thanksgiving this week.
01:21:38 I had one, it was pretty good.
01:21:40 How was your Thanksgiving, Twitch?
01:21:42 It was good.
01:21:43 I went to go see my family.
01:21:47 Like I always do, we always go to my uncle's place.
01:21:50 We have been going since I was a kid.
01:21:54 Literally, I don't think there's been a single year
01:21:56 where we haven't gone.
01:21:57 So I've been doing that
01:21:58 since I was like single digits old.
01:22:00 So, it's cool.
01:22:06 We did not do like an extended family Thanksgiving.
01:22:09 Pretty much just hung out with my parents and my sister
01:22:11 and my dad's like best friend from a childhood came over
01:22:17 and then you just had dinner and it was good.
01:22:20 We watched a movie.
01:22:21 I think it's, we watched a movie called,
01:22:25 I think it was called Bullet Train and I hated it.
01:22:27 Oh, I've seen a clip from that
01:22:29 and I wanted to watch it based on the premise alone
01:22:32 and how silly it looked.
01:22:34 It looked, I just did not appreciate Brad Pitt's
01:22:39 twee, cutesy little quips and dialogue.
01:22:42 They were so irritating that I just decided
01:22:45 that I hated the movie
01:22:46 and then I couldn't take any of the action seriously.
01:22:52 I don't think it was meant to be taken seriously.
01:22:53 It was meant to be like a big cartoon.
01:22:56 But just annoying, just the twee Joss Whedon-esque dialogue
01:23:00 was really irritating and I just couldn't stand it.
01:23:03 The Whedonisms.
01:23:05 The Whedonism, yeah, yeah.
01:23:07 Ice quip.
01:23:08 I'm very sorry.
01:23:09 Thank you.
01:23:11 Thank you very much.
01:23:12 Thank you for saying that.
01:23:12 Sorry that you had that experience
01:23:14 on Thanksgiving, the most holy of days.
01:23:18 And my dad, my dad is so impossible to watch a movie with
01:23:23 because he will literally, he'll quip
01:23:26 about whatever's on screen, like nonstop,
01:23:30 like every like 30 seconds.
01:23:33 Like he can't stop.
01:23:34 He can't stop making a little quip.
01:23:36 Even if it's just like, the bad guy comes on screen.
01:23:40 My dad would just be like, bad guy.
01:23:42 He'll just like say that.
01:23:44 And then like 15 seconds later,
01:23:47 I don't know, somebody gets shot and he'll go like,
01:23:50 he'll go like, oh, shot or something.
01:23:52 It's like, shut up.
01:23:54 Shut the fuck up.
01:23:56 Dude, great quips.
01:23:59 Sometimes he tries to be clever with them,
01:24:00 but sometimes they're just like completely banal,
01:24:03 just like saying what he's seeing.
01:24:06 Why?
01:24:06 Why?
01:24:08 I totally understand.
01:24:09 So funny.
01:24:12 Just why are you like this?
01:24:15 It reminds me of, I don't remember.
01:24:17 I think I was watching Hollow Man when that came out.
01:24:21 It was in the movie theater.
01:24:23 And I was but a wee babby.
01:24:25 I don't know, I was like a kid, teenager, whatever.
01:24:27 And I think my mom was with me
01:24:29 because she wanted to see it too.
01:24:31 So we're in the movie and every time anything
01:24:34 remotely spooky or foreboding what happened,
01:24:36 there was this one guy who in a very deep voice
01:24:40 would just go, aw damn.
01:24:41 Like, but like the whole theater could hear him.
01:24:45 And it would always be like, aw damn.
01:24:46 And like, it just kept building and building
01:24:48 until finally something like actual,
01:24:50 I think like there were some boobs on screen.
01:24:52 And he was like, aw damn, like really stupid,
01:24:56 but I kept laughing.
01:24:57 Me when I see boobs, aw damn.
01:25:00 It was really dumb and immature, but I laughed anyway.
01:25:04 Yeah.
01:25:06 I think it's like a relieve the tension for yourself.
01:25:11 It's like you relieve the tension of what's going on screen
01:25:14 by quipping about it or just saying something.
01:25:16 Yeah, probably.
01:25:17 I've noticed, I've noticed I used to do that
01:25:21 when there was something like a romantic scene.
01:25:24 And I'm like, I don't wanna feel like feelings right now.
01:25:26 But what if they farted?
01:25:28 What if I like make gross lip slacking noises
01:25:32 to like undercut the emotional resonance
01:25:35 of the scene I'm watching?
01:25:37 Yeah, I don't do it anymore though.
01:25:39 I try to allow things to affect me because that's better.
01:25:43 I had a moment recently like that
01:25:45 where I was watching the Wachowski Speed Racer movie,
01:25:51 which I love, I love that movie so much.
01:25:55 I saw that when I was younger.
01:25:57 I saw it when it was fairly new
01:25:58 and I remember thinking that it was great
01:26:01 and then I heard that it was really bad.
01:26:03 And I was like, what the fuck are people talking about?
01:26:05 I, I, but, but culture has come around.
01:26:07 Culture has vindicated me.
01:26:09 I think we as a society have decided
01:26:11 that actually it's amazing.
01:26:13 We're now ready for Speed Racer and what it has to say.
01:26:17 It was fun.
01:26:18 It was way fun.
01:26:19 I loved the movie.
01:26:20 I thought it was great.
01:26:20 The visuals were incredible.
01:26:21 Action was well choreographed.
01:26:24 I loved some of the neat stuff they were doing.
01:26:27 I love the scene in the snow
01:26:29 and they're using the snow and the movement of the camera
01:26:31 to generate anime speed lines.
01:26:33 I'm like, that's so clever.
01:26:35 I liked them.
01:26:36 There's a, I remember there's a shot where like,
01:26:38 I think it's when Speed Racer and the girl like kiss
01:26:41 at the end.
01:26:42 That's what he has.
01:26:43 You know, and like, you know,
01:26:45 that's what I was building too.
01:26:46 Yeah. When you unfocus the lens
01:26:48 and the lights in the background like expand into circles.
01:26:52 Well, they do that, but they expand into hearts.
01:26:54 Instead, it looks like a floaty anime background.
01:26:56 And it's just fantastic.
01:26:58 Speaking of that scene, like you said,
01:27:00 commenting so you can kind of like relieve
01:27:03 the tension for yourself or you're like,
01:27:04 oh, I don't want to feel things.
01:27:06 I was, this is the only part of the movie
01:27:08 that I was disappointed in.
01:27:09 I loved Spritle in the movie.
01:27:11 People are like, he's just like a dumb annoying kid.
01:27:13 I'm like, yeah, but he's supposed to be
01:27:14 like a dumb annoying kid.
01:27:15 And he kind of sticks to himself.
01:27:16 He doesn't really interfere with the story much.
01:27:18 But there's one part at the very end,
01:27:20 just like you were saying,
01:27:22 where Speed wins the big race.
01:27:23 I know, shocker spoilers.
01:27:25 And he goes to kiss Trixie.
01:27:27 And the scene freeze frames and Spritle comes on
01:27:31 and along with ChimChim, just as doctors.
01:27:34 And he's like warning, the following scene
01:27:36 may contain gross feelings and cooties
01:27:38 and something, something.
01:27:39 If you have a weak constitution, please look away now.
01:27:42 And I was like, okay, like it is kind of like a funny joke,
01:27:45 but not at the climax of the movie.
01:27:47 But also, yeah.
01:27:49 Like I was waiting for this.
01:27:50 They've been building to it.
01:27:51 And like Spritle like kept interrupting them
01:27:54 before they can like, you know,
01:27:55 get romantic with one another.
01:27:57 But like, I was into it.
01:27:58 I was like, wow, like I feel emotionally connected
01:28:00 to these characters and what they're going through.
01:28:02 And finally, Speed gets like, you know,
01:28:04 his well-deserved first place win
01:28:07 and he's going to go kiss Trixie
01:28:08 like he promised he would do at the beginning of the movie.
01:28:10 And then Spritle comes in and ruins it.
01:28:12 And I'm like, like, I,
01:28:15 I don't, I, yeah.
01:28:16 If you want to break the-
01:28:17 Sounds a little annoying.
01:28:18 Sounds a little annoying.
01:28:19 If you want to break the tension for yourself,
01:28:21 like you said, by like saying something
01:28:22 or making a fart noise or whatever the heck it is,
01:28:24 you know, fine.
01:28:26 But it annoys me when the movie does it for you
01:28:28 because what if I wanted to be invested in that scene?
01:28:31 Now that I am like,
01:28:32 because now that I'm looking at it as an adult,
01:28:34 I'm like, I think Speed Racer is like a work of art.
01:28:36 I think it's great.
01:28:37 It has great messages.
01:28:38 It's got good, like it's just,
01:28:40 it's just produced really well.
01:28:41 Like everything about it is great.
01:28:43 So then I get to this end scene
01:28:44 and then I'm like, I get slapped on the face for,
01:28:48 you know, almost the perfect movie.
01:28:50 Yeah. That is the one and only like-
01:28:52 So close.
01:28:53 You know, so here's what I'm going to do.
01:28:56 I believe the music cuts as well,
01:28:59 but it resumes where it's supposed to.
01:29:01 I'm just going to go ahead and load up the file
01:29:03 into like Sony Vegas or something.
01:29:05 And I'm just going to cut out that part with Sprytal.
01:29:07 And I'll just have it resume uninterrupted for myself.
01:29:10 The Revo cut.
01:29:11 Yeah.
01:29:12 The Revo cut.
01:29:14 If I-
01:29:15 Isn't that the thing they do in like,
01:29:19 like some or most like Marvel superhero movies
01:29:23 where they sort of, they're embarrassed to be superheroes?
01:29:27 Like, isn't that like a, like a,
01:29:29 like what sort of power do you have?
01:29:30 Isn't that like stupid?
01:29:31 It was funny.
01:29:32 Like they say that in the text.
01:29:34 They like sort of embarrassed.
01:29:35 It was funny like once, like the first couple of the times
01:29:38 that it happens, like, you know-
01:29:40 Common isn't it isn't it wacky that we have that we are wearing spandex and
01:29:46 Yeah, it's like movies. Like what were you expecting yellow spandex? Oh
01:29:50 I mean
01:29:51 It was funny when you do it like once and I get it
01:29:54 Yeah, and so I give the X-Men a pass that was pretty funny
01:29:56 Like yeah, they would have matching uniforms like they're supposed to because they're like a team
01:30:01 But then the Marvel movies started doing it and like okay, I get it like you know
01:30:04 It's a funny joke, but then they do it in like every single movie like every single time a new hero gets introduced
01:30:11 They have to draw attention to the fact like huh, isn't it silly that I'm wearing this funny costume
01:30:16 And I have these weird patterns like dude. We're living we are now invested so insecure
01:30:21 Yeah, we're now in a universe where a purple alien man with you know
01:30:26 Tire marks for a chin snapped to the entire universe out of existence. I am ready to believe anything
01:30:32 You don't have to like like deflect like it's cool if you're a weird dude who wears a bug costume like I'm
01:30:39 I'm ready for it now. It's I've
01:30:41 I'm cool with it. I am I am I have not seen a Marvel movie since
01:30:49 I don't even know how long I'm I'm free. I'm pure
01:30:53 of its
01:30:54 Malif Lewis influence
01:30:57 The last one I've watched also I can't I can't call them shit because I haven't seen them
01:31:02 I can't complain. I only kept I catch that from like people saying it and also remembering
01:31:07 Like certain scenes where they're just sort of like, you know comic books were from the the 1950s and those were so strange
01:31:14 Huh? Hey modern audience. Don't you find that cringe? Well, enjoy it anyway, but also
01:31:19 Don't don't feel too bad about enjoying it. It's kind of like how
01:31:23 Using speed racer as a great example of this
01:31:26 um
01:31:27 speed racer is
01:31:29 Impinibly campy and silly
01:31:32 But the movie has internal logic to it where they don't acknowledge that things are campy and silly
01:31:37 Yes, that is just their world and the the characters the characters are serious about what's going on
01:31:44 Yeah, and so I'm like, yeah, I'm fully invested in this. I am totally okay with watching
01:31:50 A movie about a guy whose first name is speed and his last name is racer and is
01:31:57 No problem brothers with someone named sprightle, which is not a name. I think I've heard
01:32:03 Ever uh, and they have a pet monkey named chimchim who is also super intelligent like I'm cool
01:32:09 You I'm already sold. You don't have to like
01:32:12 You don't have to be like, haha, isn't it funny that his name is speed like no like I get it. Yes. Yes. Yes. It is
01:32:19 That's why I'm watching the movie. Yeah to be entertained by this
01:32:23 Stop drawing attention to it. Let's let's just take that and run with it. All right. We don't need to wallow
01:32:28 We don't need to wallow in the premise, please. It's kind of like when people engage in like, um self-deprecating humor
01:32:36 Um, but it might be funny once or twice, but once you do it
01:32:39 Too many times it's kind of like bro. Are you okay?
01:32:42 Like are you sure that you're not like actually insecure about yourself? Like, you know, you know what I mean?
01:32:47 And that's how some of these movies come across
01:32:50 So that's why I love speed racer because they just they're unabashedly
01:32:53 Cheesy and silly and campy, but they also treat it with like seriousness and reverence
01:32:58 um internally
01:33:00 And I'm like, yeah, I buy into it. I for
01:33:04 For just an hour and a half
01:33:06 I believe that miracles can happen on the raceway and I am totally
01:33:11 Hell yeah, and I am totally fine. I believe that love can bloom on the battlefield. Yes. Yes
01:33:18 And I he makes art when he races and I am totally fine suspending my disbelief and just
01:33:25 Enjoying that you don't have to
01:33:28 Tell me isn't it silly like I'm not watching a realistic movie. I'm watching a marvel movie
01:33:33 You don't have to sell me on it
01:33:34 Like you stopped being super realistic after like iron man one like and iron man one was great
01:33:40 But they they quickly realized that we're going to continue down this path. We are going to have to get
01:33:45 Consistently more and more silly and cosmic because that's just the nature of Marvel comics and that's fine
01:33:51 But don't draw attention to it. Just shut up. Give it to me. I'm willing to believe it
01:33:56 Just like how Godzilla was Godzilla 2014. Um, they try doing a somewhat realistic one where he fights king kong
01:34:03 Well, I'm getting to that. So the first Godzilla 2014 was the one where he fights the the mutes the
01:34:11 Mutated ultra something whatever organism. I don't know what the hell it stands for
01:34:15 Um, and they did a somewhat serious take on Godzilla where brian cranced in his wife dies and like a mudo escape
01:34:22 All that other crap. So like I'm fine with that. The first outing was like
01:34:27 Kind of serious much like the first Godzilla movie was meant to be taken somewhat seriously
01:34:32 It had it had a lot to say. Um, but then as they continue down the Godzilla rabbit hole
01:34:38 quite literally
01:34:40 They realize. Oh, yeah, these movies are going to have to go in a very silly direction because the nature of Godzilla movies
01:34:47 Get a little silly. Um
01:34:49 So the tone in Godzilla 2014 versus
01:34:53 Godzilla versus king kong is stark contrast to one another
01:34:57 They and I and I'm glad because they don't really draw too much attention to it
01:35:01 They just fully embrace the fact that um, there's a hollow earth that's always been there and there's portals
01:35:07 And there's monsters everywhere and we're just not gonna internally
01:35:11 We're just gonna accept that this is reality and we're not going to like
01:35:15 Wink wink at the audience and be like, isn't it crazy that all those? No, just shut up. Let me enjoy my monster wrestling match. It's fine
01:35:24 It's fine. I'm willing to I'm willing to accept it
01:35:28 I gotta use the bathroom. I'll be back in a minute. No, you're not allowed. No, it's okay. Go ahead. Okay. All right
01:35:34 You're right. No, I'll just if you say I wish
01:35:38 You must answer me my riddles three
01:35:41 All right, I'll be back in one minute
01:35:47 So how are you given I'm glad to be here
01:35:51 Yeah, it's great. I'm glad to have you you don't worry about rambling because that's
01:35:55 That's what people crave. They crave large
01:35:58 Long conversations about I get nervous because uh, I have a tendency to talk way too much
01:36:04 And I I have a tendency to accidentally talk over people and I don't mean to I'm just I'm very passionate about the things
01:36:10 We're discussing and so it's not I'm not trying to be rude. I'm just excited
01:36:15 No, it's great. It's it's don't worry about it. Okay. I um
01:36:19 I I'm good. I I I did zone out a few times where I'm like, okay
01:36:24 So many of these these things being talked about are like I don't even having the faintest idea what it means
01:36:32 But that's okay. I'll I'll watch the lecture. I'll definitely play legends because that looks fun
01:36:38 Legends is a lot of fun. Um, my recommendation for legends
01:36:41 This always helped me some people say they don't like this, but
01:36:45 Everyone's like, oh the controls on legends are like tanky and crappy, but uh, if you go to the options, you can actually switch
01:36:52 Um, because there's dedicated buttons for strafing and there's dedicated buttons for rotating
01:36:57 And so I always set my rotating buttons to just left and right on the d-pad
01:37:01 So that I can navigate with one hand and if I'm going to strafe I use the shoulder buttons for that
01:37:05 Um by default, it's the opposite left and right actually make you
01:37:09 um
01:37:10 Actually make you strafe and then the l and r is what you use to rotate
01:37:14 That just doesn't feel natural to me
01:37:15 And I feel like using your d-pad to run and also rotate and point in the direction that you want to go in
01:37:21 That just feels more
01:37:23 Like normal to me. So that's just the only thing I would recommend. I think that's an easier control scheme
01:37:28 That's just me. Everyone of course is welcome to do whatever
01:37:32 Yeah, that's the one thing I've heard about that is that it's it's early 3d. So that there's no
01:37:37 Consensus on how you do the traversal in 3d and the controls are a bit odd. It's also so early that there wasn't even
01:37:45 Analog sticks. This was like an early PlayStation game. So the the dual shock controller didn't even like come out yet
01:37:51 Pre-ape escape. Yes, exactly. So
01:37:55 um, and here's the thing
01:37:57 Legends 2 did come out
01:37:59 Uh after the dual shock. So it does have analog controls, but it they're not actually analog controls when I played
01:38:07 um
01:38:08 I noticed hey, wait a second
01:38:10 I can set the right joystick to aim like a modern
01:38:14 Third person and or first person shooter game. That sounds amazing
01:38:17 All I need now is like a target reticle in the center of the screen. Um, but it's not
01:38:23 Actually analog what it does is it takes the up down left and right inputs of your joystick and just moves the camera
01:38:30 Like that
01:38:31 Um, it kind of just automates having to like hold down the look button and then pressing the the d-pad buttons
01:38:37 So it's not true analog
01:38:39 But I think that if you took mega man legends and just gave it like a proper
01:38:43 double joystick
01:38:45 movement and or
01:38:47 aiming scheme
01:38:49 Legends would would play like a dream like it actually
01:38:52 Once you've gotten used to the controls like I have
01:38:55 It's it's really fun
01:38:57 Like I know these like little movements to like move him in like a perfect circle
01:39:01 And I know how to get him like like tight circles. Um, so I can like collect all the the refractors really easily
01:39:07 Running and jumping and like grabbing onto a ledge feels so satisfying and then climbing up
01:39:11 So I think if it just had some modern controls on it, I think legends would stand toe to toe with like modern action games
01:39:19 It's just unfortunately
01:39:21 It was kind of ahead of its time and it came out
01:39:24 Before control schemes. Well, I mean, I don't even want to say it had a good controller
01:39:29 Yeah, I was gonna say it's not even a control scheme. There wasn't even a good controller for it
01:39:34 Before the dual shock set the standard for all consoles going forward
01:39:38 I'm trying to imagine
01:39:40 Because like I've played like ratchet and clank with like the strafe lock
01:39:44 So that's like you you're always strafing
01:39:48 Um, and you move you rotate the camera rather than
01:39:51 Like free free walking around that's pretty much how legends works except l1 and r1 is what rotates the camera
01:39:59 Yeah
01:40:00 I'm trying to like visualize like walking around because like um if I use a dual shock with legends
01:40:06 Will it recognize the analog stick as the directional buttons for legends one? It doesn't it just has no dual shock
01:40:13 Input at all because it predates the dual shock
01:40:16 So there's not even a way to have it recognize
01:40:20 Your your analog stick so you have to play it with d-pad
01:40:24 Um legends two you can enable
01:40:28 The dual shock controls, but they're not analog controls and that's the issue
01:40:33 So like the all it really does is let you use your analog sticks as a replacement for up down left right d-pad buttons
01:40:41 That's that's literally all it does at least as far as I can tell other people have told me that's not the case
01:40:46 But when I play, um, it it doesn't feel that way
01:40:49 Um, it feels like when you press
01:40:52 Like anything on the joystick it doesn't move
01:40:55 smoothly, it's just like
01:40:57 It's it's literally just cardinal directions on the on the joystick. Um, so I just play with him
01:41:03 Welcome back. I'm back by the way, but I didn't want to interrupt. Oh, it's all good
01:41:06 We're we're discussing how legends was ahead of its time and no one appreciates it
01:41:11 Yeah, yeah
01:41:12 The um the the tank controls are a little bit they take a little bit of getting used to but once you are used to them
01:41:20 It's it's fine. Yeah
01:41:22 If you do play legends one by the way, um another thing I recommend besides
01:41:27 Um messing with both control schemes
01:41:30 um, I also recommend
01:41:32 Grinding a lot in the early game because there's a very difficult boss rush that they just throw you at
01:41:38 Um
01:41:40 Right at the start of the game. Uh, if you hear them talking about pirates
01:41:43 Um, you've gone too far. Don't proceed back into the city. Please
01:41:48 Get a lot a lot of zenny and and buy power ups
01:41:52 You're talking about against the three dudes
01:41:54 Yeah, they make you fight, um the serve bots and they're the bloom bears and then you fight tron and then after tron you have to
01:42:00 Fight bonbon. Um, it's like a boss rush. It's very difficult for early games
01:42:05 Especially if you're not prepared for it. So save Austin. I do I do remember that
01:42:10 I did get
01:42:12 Yeah, that one did
01:42:13 I lost a bunch of times. Yeah, it definitely, um, it definitely pushed my shit in when I first played it. Um, but I then had the
01:42:21 Uh, the the foresight because I had a memory card, which is new technology to reload my save
01:42:27 Go to the dungeon and just grind for zenny and here's the cool thing about legends. Um
01:42:33 Legends too would change this but legends one once you can buy, um
01:42:37 Your your your health increase like by like one pip same thing for your your energy canteen, which will like refills your health
01:42:44 Um, you can just increase it forever. There's no cap
01:42:48 It'll just keep letting you increase it. Um, and it doesn't block it off based on what part of the game you're in
01:42:53 Um, so if you have the money, you can technically get yourself to like 200 health and the game won't stop you
01:43:00 You gotta you. Yeah, I think I forgot to use my energy canteen. I like forgot that I had it
01:43:06 But like, yeah, you got to be using the energy canteen. You you can't be sleeping on it canteen saves you
01:43:11 Yeah, gatorade. It's I'm just I'm the kind of gamer that I'm just get really focused on what I'm doing
01:43:16 And I forget to like use the I use the items in my inventory for what's there
01:43:21 So I have definitely done that a few times where I was like, ah crap. I forgot I could heal
01:43:25 You know what I used to do as a kid when I when I was fighting Tronbon
01:43:29 Uh, because she would kick my ass so hard. I'd run away from her and then go buy a soda out of the machine
01:43:36 In the middle of a battle in the middle of the battle
01:43:38 You could do that lol
01:43:39 You can you can literally go buy so you you're mashing through that because she's still shooting at you while the dialogue is happening
01:43:45 So I've had I've had times where it's like
01:43:49 It's a vending machine. It costs 100s any to get a soda
01:43:53 Do you want and then like all of a sudden a bomb just blows up the vending machine and like go flying and I'm like dammit
01:43:58 So I quickly run to where the next one is, you know
01:44:01 That is awesome. It's it's hilarious
01:44:04 Uh, I also found out you can just uh, you can kick the vending machines and it'll just give you a soda instantly
01:44:09 So I started doing that during the battle because it was quicker
01:44:12 But I also found that if you kick it too many times the vending machine explodes and then you can't use it anymore
01:44:18 But if you buy a soda from it, I think you can get like three refills out of it and then it runs out
01:44:25 Yeah, so uh, those are just I didn't know you could blow up the vending machines by kicking them. That's so
01:44:31 Yeah, there's so there's a morality system in legends actually
01:44:34 I I know I know about that because I didn't know about it at all in legends one
01:44:38 But I had to use it in legends two in order to get
01:44:42 Yeah, yeah, that were the last weapon which I didn't even use by the way
01:44:46 Yeah, it's it's a whatever weapon. It's not even worth it for it's such a cool secret that like oh, you have to be evil mega man to get it
01:44:53 um
01:44:54 But it's not even worth I mean it depends on the gameplay you're going through because apparently it gets stronger based on how evil you are
01:45:01 Uh, oh like frustration
01:45:03 Yes
01:45:04 so
01:45:06 um
01:45:08 I'm looking at um
01:45:10 Like mega man's mega man legends on pc
01:45:14 Is that is that like a which which is the best way to play so the game?
01:45:20 Uh, I I officially I do not endorse piracy, but in my opinion the best way to play legends
01:45:25 No, uh, is to emulate it and uh increase the resolution and turn on a widescreen hack
01:45:31 Um, I've played it like that. I play legends and legends too at like two to four times resolution and the game looks beautiful
01:45:39 Um, it's really really nice. I mean I found like an
01:45:43 Abandoned where like like an actual like released pc version of it
01:45:48 Just on this abandonware site. I don't think was it actually released in pc?
01:45:52 I thought it was just uh, it was on playstation and then they released it on the n64 as mega man 64
01:45:58 You might be downloading a rom of it, but it definitely was never released for pc
01:46:03 But um, can you send me that link because now i'm curious what the heck you stumbled upon
01:46:07 I am yeah, I just I just typed it in hang on. I did I did emulate it
01:46:11 Uh, I didn't this on a widescreen
01:46:15 Resolution adjustments pretty cool united states. What?
01:46:20 Is this real? I've never heard of this. I'm gonna have to look into this
01:46:23 Is it uh, is it meg? Is it rock man dash a great adventure to save the world? Uh by strawberry soft
01:46:29 Because that is a taiwanese game that was on pc, but not regular mega man legends. I think they might just be calling at this
01:46:37 I'm so confused. What it looks like we find mega man legends
01:46:44 I don't i'm not familiar with this website wait the reception i'm looking at the wiki pd. Yeah, it says it was released in taiwan
01:46:52 So it's uh in the reception but the pc and nintendo 64 version had lower averages. So there was a pc version
01:47:00 What?
01:47:02 I guess I didn't know there was a pc version
01:47:05 Huh pc version received a more negative review game spot gave it a bad three eight point six out of ten damn
01:47:11 Saying the playstation port is better
01:47:15 I've never heard of this
01:47:18 Uh wacky I um I did I did emulate it the only
01:47:22 The only time I like used any like emulator uh things to like do anything to it
01:47:28 Is just when I wanted to grind for zenny against the golden bird into
01:47:33 That
01:47:35 The uh mirak, I believe it's called. Yeah, I I don't know its name, but yeah, um, they're like pokemon
01:47:41 I know some of them not all of them. That's um, that's uh, you know
01:47:46 Even with even with like I played it at like 10 times speed or whatever and I just developed muscle memory to like
01:47:52 Go in the door
01:47:53 Uh go in the door
01:47:55 Shoot the bullet shoot the bullets
01:47:56 I remember exactly how long to hold the button down and then use the vacuum go out the door
01:48:00 Turn around go back in the door and I just had a perfect like a perfect formula for just the order and the and the rate at
01:48:06 Which is the buttons and it still took it still took like a long time even at like
01:48:11 Sped up. Yeah, it's really really they give you
01:48:14 I'm glad they even include a way of getting like a ton as any that way. That's nice of them
01:48:19 It is nice, but it's good for the early game. It's still inconvenient. Like it's not it's not that
01:48:24 I mean without without without that bird like I just probably just wouldn't
01:48:28 I don't even remember what I was saving up for
01:48:31 Probably the shining laser because the shining laser costs like several millions any to upgrade completely. Yeah, I think it probably
01:48:37 I know
01:48:39 I know it's a crazy expensive item to upgrade to begin with and then the final attack upgrade
01:48:43 Costs you a millions any flat just because
01:48:46 I I don't think I upgraded it. I just I just got it
01:48:50 I mean at that point if you're emulating, I mean I did this on on my I mean, I'm playing through legends too right now
01:48:55 I actually I'm near the end of the game
01:48:57 I'm showing my girlfriend the game. So I'm like she loves it. She's fallen in love with Tron Bonn. She thinks she's great
01:49:01 Tron Bonn is great. She is fantastic. Tron Bonn is so cool
01:49:05 She's she's amazing too. She's like just a good-ass character. She's got some nuance to her. She kills cops
01:49:11 She blows up kills children children's in fairness. She becomes friends with the cop and misinventions of Tron Bonn
01:49:18 So that kind of makes up for it. That's what I dislike about it. That's the one black mark on her character
01:49:22 Really? Yeah
01:49:25 She's she's working. She can't she can't stoop to
01:49:29 No, I like she should be full full anarchy
01:49:32 Well in fairness it's not like she doesn't plunder and destroy the island she goes to it's just she just kind of helps this one cop
01:49:40 Who's like like, oh no, everyone's I'm gonna get fired and she's like well, she's like authority of bone
01:49:46 I know I know
01:49:48 But for emulating, uh, I just turned on the the infinite zenny cheat and then turned it off because it instantly jumps your zenny to like
01:49:55 999999
01:49:57 And so I've just been coasting off of that for you know, fair. You know what? I don't want to grind
01:50:02 I want it. I wanted to do it like
01:50:05 Sword I get I mean I kind of cheated but I sort of did it. I sort of did the grind
01:50:10 I've already put in my time. Okay when I was a kid
01:50:14 If I was doing it again, and I had an option to just like can I please just fast forward through
01:50:19 Spending an hour and a half grinding like yeah, I've done it. It's fine. I've done it already
01:50:23 So like I don't have any qualms about cheating to get through that. That's the only thing I cheated at though
01:50:27 Everything else. I'm playing legit
01:50:29 I just don't want to have to sit there and get like billions of zenny for no reason
01:50:32 Although, you know when when you're in the mood for it, there's something to be said for just okay
01:50:37 I gotta grind zenny for an hour, you know, whatever just put on a youtube video. Just just do it
01:50:42 I believe it was it was designed to help to incentivize you to explore
01:50:47 Because it's like well, you need a bunch of zenny. So what are you gonna do?
01:50:50 So the idea is that you were supposed to go and explore because I did this in legends one
01:50:54 I would explore every single look and cranny that I could possibly get to
01:50:58 Um, and then by the time I was done, I've explored
01:51:02 Whatever was available to me and then I come back and I'm like, oh, I have like I'm like several thousands any richer
01:51:07 And I've explored and found more items
01:51:09 Um, yeah, you know, you know
01:51:11 Without a without a guide like because I did I didn't like refer to a guide extensively
01:51:17 But when I was missing something I would look I would look up like where to find a certain item or something like that
01:51:22 With without that. Yeah, all I would have been able to do is like go back through every dungeon and explore everywhere
01:51:27 And if I was doing that like back in the day, then like, yeah, I probably just would have accrued it would have taken me
01:51:34 months to beat the game
01:51:36 But I would have accrued all kinds of zenny just from the exploration and stuff. So yeah
01:51:42 Legends is an interesting balance because you can play it like a traditional mega man game and beat it in like an hour
01:51:48 If you really wanted, um, or yeah, if you if you want to treat it more like an adventure rpg
01:51:54 You can actually spend like days playing this game and getting lost in it. It's all off. Oh, yeah have to do it, you know
01:52:00 I I honestly felt a little bit bad after I looked up some stuff about legends one because
01:52:06 When I went I think I was looking for maybe like the bone or like I had missed the bone or something. Oh, yeah
01:52:11 It's like in a hole somewhere. Yeah, it's just like there's stuff just like in holes in walls
01:52:15 And like when I looked it up and I went and I found it I was like, you know, that wasn't that hard
01:52:19 If you know, I I could have just if I just made a cursory sweep of like
01:52:24 The dungeons I've been to I were like, I could have find this myself like damn
01:52:27 Yeah
01:52:29 It does kind of feel I cheated not only my I cheated not only the game but also myself. I learned nothing
01:52:35 Um, well, you know what?
01:52:36 If you just give it a give it a year and then come back to the game and you'll have forgotten all about it, so
01:52:41 Yeah, probably
01:52:43 Legends 2 helps mitigate some of the grinding to you. I've noticed where um, there are certain dungeons
01:52:48 They're optional dungeons. You need to get like the the dickers license for it
01:52:51 um
01:52:53 Which where the the price at the end is like a giant refractor
01:52:56 Uh, and I looked at it. I'm like, oh cool. Like I remember legends one
01:52:59 We needed these to repair various machines
01:53:02 But in this one, they literally say you could probably sell it for a bunch of money
01:53:06 Yeah, so I'm like, oh, that's cool
01:53:08 Uh, which is ironic because in legends one this always bug me in legends one
01:53:12 You start the game with a large blue refractor because of the opening cutscene where he steals it out of the chamber
01:53:18 um
01:53:20 Right and uh, and you have it for the rest of the game and I'm like, but you don't you don't it's not useful
01:53:25 It's not useful and theoretically you could sell it. Yeah
01:53:28 I remember specifically reading in the manual and even in uh, I think a game pro magazine that reviewed the game
01:53:34 They were like you can go to the bank and you can trade in your refractors for for zenny and I'm like, oh really?
01:53:39 So that's what the blue thing is for uh, but no, it absolutely you cannot it's just there for the rest of the game
01:53:45 Sad sad. So I guess you just have to pretend like in universe. That's what people do. So I'm like, yeah
01:53:50 Aren't zenny aren't zenny just little refractors like isn't that what they are?
01:53:55 so
01:53:57 Yes, and no, I don't think
01:54:00 Legends has reverted back to like
01:54:03 For lack of a better term the gold standard and everyone's keeping around like little bullion in like a sack somewhere
01:54:09 I think the idea is that um, you can trade in refractors for money
01:54:15 Because everyone is so dependent upon them as a power source
01:54:18 So the idea is like different refractors of different sizes and purities
01:54:22 Can be traded in at a bank who appraise the the
01:54:26 The refractor that you have and then they give you money in exchange
01:54:29 So I think they still run off of like a paper and coin money system
01:54:32 So so it's like it's as good as money
01:54:35 But it's like the the refractors that you find are as good as money
01:54:38 But they're not literally the money the zenny that you're right
01:54:42 For instance, I believe there's a side mission in legends one where
01:54:47 The the serve bots steal a bunch of money from a bank and you're supposed to catch them
01:54:51 And it's a it's a briefcase full of dollar bills not
01:54:54 Like refractors. It's not like a super heavy
01:54:58 Jangly box of refractors. It's it's money. I do I do remember that I do remember that
01:55:04 There's actually content in legends that I've never seen because I'm such a pansy and I can't bring myself to
01:55:09 To do it if you let them steal the money like there's three options
01:55:12 There's you can either catch them and return the money catch them and keep the money
01:55:17 Which instantly turns you full evil mega man
01:55:20 Or you can let them get away and if they get away
01:55:24 They buy a plot of land in downtown and build a burger restaurant
01:55:28 I
01:55:29 I've never seen this content for myself because I never let them get away, but
01:55:33 That only happens if they get away because like I think I I didn't let them get away
01:55:37 But I remember that they have a restaurant
01:55:40 In downtown later. Don't you like you have to well, that's why they were stealing the money to fund the restaurant
01:55:46 Maybe I'm thinking of a different thing. There is I did not let them get away
01:55:49 But there is a restaurant in the town later that where the servebots are behind
01:55:54 the
01:55:55 Counter, maybe there's like a different
01:55:58 I don't know if there's another way to trigger it. I don't know how to get that to to work
01:56:02 But I've only ever
01:56:04 I've only ever
01:56:06 Because like they're stealing the money to fund the restaurant
01:56:08 So one would assume logically that if the you let them get away with it
01:56:12 Then they um, they build it. I guess you could also just not trigger that cut scene and maybe they like still build it
01:56:18 Anyway, I don't know. I I I definitely did the the thing
01:56:22 And I I I'm
01:56:24 Swear there's got to be some other way to do it because I went to that restaurant. It's possible
01:56:28 I I don't know what it is though because I have never seen it myself
01:56:32 The only way that I have seen it is I saw someone who had like a like model rips of like the whole thing
01:56:37 And I was able to like see the restaurant like in a 3d viewer. I was like, oh cool. I've never seen this before
01:56:43 base base base
01:56:45 cool, um, I love the servebots
01:56:47 Yeah, I don't know why everyone lets them get away with everything though like, um
01:56:52 They're like they're clearly the pirates that are attacking the city
01:56:55 And yet they just go around and do things and everyone's like a small yellow child came by later came by lately
01:57:01 And he said something funny, but I'm like those are the pirates. Why are you guys okay with it?
01:57:07 Why isn't the whole town collectively running up to them and kicking them?
01:57:11 Because they're so cute. They're so cute and sweet and nice and friendly and who's you know
01:57:16 That's their defense mechanism. They're just and they're just a little guy. They're just a little guy. He's just a little guy
01:57:23 Who can hate a thing like that?
01:57:25 I don't think I didn't oh give I wanted to ask
01:57:30 Have you played any more inscription or have you put that down for the for the moment?
01:57:34 I put it down for the time being
01:57:37 I know everyone's everyone says like oh you're just you're just
01:57:43 You're you're you haven't seen the big reveal
01:57:48 Where something happens and you you'll go. Oh my god. I can't possibly tell this to anyone
01:57:53 I mean, I know that you know that you have not seen the full game, but
01:57:58 Yes, um, okay. Just just curious because we didn't talk about it last week
01:58:02 Uh, twitch. Are you familiar with inscription?
01:58:05 I am not
01:58:06 it's a uh in short
01:58:09 it's kind of a
01:58:11 horror themed
01:58:13 card based deck building games. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. I think is this one with like the don't spoil it
01:58:19 Don't no no no spoiling. Okay. This is just like the first thing. Isn't there like a weird like swamp man or something?
01:58:25 Yeah, the guy with the eyes the crazy eyes
01:58:29 Yeah, you're in his like swamp cabin or something or yeah, and like you you look around his cabin
01:58:34 You're looking for clues for like, okay. Yes. Yes. I have seen a playthrough of that. I am familiar with it. It's okay. Okay
01:58:40 Uh, yeah, I I got uh, I made gib play it
01:58:45 That it does seem like a really cool game. I like it a lot. Uh
01:58:50 Yeah, that's pretty good
01:58:53 But I can't talk about it because
01:58:56 Gib has
01:58:57 Failed because fails me suck. I suck at the game. No, you don't
01:59:02 No, you don't
01:59:04 There's the only way to fail is not to play and I'm supposed to lose you're supposed to lose a lot of times
01:59:09 It's fine. Yeah, but that just makes me upset. I hate losing lots of times
01:59:14 Just think every time you lose just think great great
01:59:18 Great just think it's great great people have walked this path great great people have failed at this same game
01:59:24 So many times and I follow in their footsteps now
01:59:28 Now it's my turn steps to my grave
01:59:30 Now it's my turn exactly. I'm just I'm just joining a line of losers over here
01:59:35 She was in a bunch damn
01:59:37 Damn can't can't believe all these gamers have like lost this game so many times
01:59:41 Like I'm a much better gamer than them because I just quit. I didn't lose
01:59:45 Yeah, you knew you knew how to leave a losing battle. You're like, you know what? I'm not going to lose again
01:59:50 I'm going to choose to leave
01:59:52 It's valid. I'm going to go like chop down a hundred million trees and runescape. You know what?
01:59:58 There's a quote. I don't know if it's by bruce lee or if it's just people attributing it to bruce lee because people love
02:00:02 Making up quotes on the internet. Uh, what is it? Do you not fear failure for there is glory even in great attempts?
02:00:09 I think yeah, it's probably heard that
02:00:12 I don't know if that's from him, but I know that's a good quote and I like that one. I don't care who it's from
02:00:16 That's me. I don't fear failure. I just don't like me my my face my face when
02:00:22 My face when I'm basking in the glory of my great attempts because I beat a video game. I'm
02:00:28 I'm just resplendent. I'll I'll get around to it
02:00:32 resplendent in my
02:00:33 It's a good word splendor. Yes. Thank you
02:00:39 Oh shit, I'm trying my my dad used a really good 70 cent word over
02:00:44 Over Thanksgiving. I'm trying to remember. What was it? You know, I've heard so many people say
02:00:49 Like for 50 cent word, I I've heard that phrase used but everyone has a different
02:00:54 Denomination of money every time someone says it. I've heard that's a good that's a good five dollar word
02:00:59 It's a good one dollar for me. For me. It's 50 cents. I would not pay more than 50 cents for a word no matter how good
02:01:04 I just I'm just saying I've always a dollar. Yeah, everyone's got a different night. You know what inflation I guess that can
02:01:10 Probably throw it off. Were we saying gibb? Yeah in in joe biden's america a 50 cent word now costs a dollar
02:01:19 Thanks, obama. Well, we thanks obama. Were you saying gibb?
02:01:23 Um, I had a question. I know this is not actually related to the megaman laur at all
02:01:29 But what the heck is mighty number nine?
02:01:32 Oh, what happened? Oh, you got the right person on for this. I haven't played it. So I mean, I know
02:01:38 All I know is that there's a kickstarter
02:01:41 Yeah, there was a kickstarter to make like a megaman thing from a megaman person
02:01:46 And it sucked so wait. Well, okay. So hold on. You got the right person on for this because I am somewhat of a mighty number nine expert
02:01:53 um, hell, yeah, so
02:01:55 Uh, keiji in a fune was like the guy who he was the megaman guy
02:02:00 Uh for 25 years. He was he was known as the megaman guy
02:02:04 He was known as the megaman guy, but I would dare say he is the megaman guy because
02:02:08 Yeah, he was a key to mura who made megaman
02:02:11 Like he basically was like the guy who made it with in a fune
02:02:14 Basically like as his partner like the site like the the next in command so to speak
02:02:18 Uh, and the two of them worked on megaman one, but it megaman was uh, key to mura's baby. Basically, it's he made it
02:02:25 Um, but he dipped at like megaman three and then in a fune took over
02:02:29 So I would say for the majority of the franchise in a fune was the one
02:02:33 You know, he's not megaman. He's not megaman stepdad. He's the dad who stepped up
02:02:38 um
02:02:39 You know what I mean quite clearly he was basically
02:02:43 He might not have been like the guy who like came up with the design initially
02:02:47 But he was sort of in charge of the series for like a long time
02:02:51 Yeah, and he helped shape like the direction of along with his team
02:02:54 He always mentions like everyone always calls him the father of megaman and he himself in every interview where someone's like
02:03:00 You know, mr. Unifune people say that you're the father of megaman and he always the first thing he does is he corrects them and he's like
02:03:07 People call me that. I didn't make megaman. I just kind of took over for it
02:03:11 Megaman is a team effort. It was created by myself or it was created by akira kidamora and myself
02:03:16 But megaman is a team effort. It's made by all the people who work on it because yeah, there's actually a surprising amount of flexibility
02:03:23 I found in the megaman franchise or who gets how much
02:03:26 Say and like what happens in like the series
02:03:29 So it's it's really interesting. I like that. It's always kind of been a team effort
02:03:32 But he is like the figurehead of megaman
02:03:35 Yeah, so I won't go into every single excruciating detail, but
02:03:39 around this time i'm gonna say
02:03:42 2010
02:03:44 I actually met him at
02:03:47 Wow, uh, new york comic con
02:03:49 Uh, does he like speak english?
02:03:52 Very basic english. He had a he had a translator there. So okay, but he was really nice
02:03:58 He was basically revealing the megaman legends three dev room project
02:04:03 Which was basically saying we're going to create a forum. You can go here
02:04:07 We're going to have contests and things you can submit ideas and if the ideas win the contest
02:04:12 We'll put them in the game. It was really great
02:04:14 Um, but then he was like i'm going to be doing autograph signings at two o'clock
02:04:17 So I I like dipped because I was like, okay. I want to stay here for this
02:04:20 But I know that this panel that i'm in right now is being recorded. I can get all this information later
02:04:25 I'm going to run over to the autograph thing and i'm glad I did because I just barely got online
02:04:30 So I met the guy he signed my copy of megaman x1. Um, I got to tell him I was like listen
02:04:36 You inspired me since I was a kid
02:04:38 I want to make video games the same way that you do your creations and your ideas and the megaman franchise means so much to me
02:04:44 And he seemed like really like touched by that
02:04:47 So I have a picture of myself with him. I actually made a megaman x t-shirt like it's a blue t-shirt
02:04:52 But it has like x's like chest plate on it. Uh, and I made myself a blue
02:04:57 Baseball cap that had like x's like helmet stuff on it. Oh, yeah
02:05:02 He he thought it was cool. I thought it was cool. If I still had it. I'd wear it. Um, that's another story
02:05:07 But anyway, he was a very nice guy. Um, he I think he really does
02:05:12 Despite his reputation now
02:05:14 I think he really does care about his fans and I think he really does care about making video games
02:05:19 I just think that he's become very misguided in recent years. But anyway
02:05:24 He announced
02:05:25 Megaman legends 3 he announced megaman universe, which was basically mario maker but for megaman in so many terms
02:05:32 And I got to play a demo of it. It was not half bad. It played like a megaman powered up in in the way that it felt
02:05:38 um
02:05:39 It wasn't half bad, uh, and then
02:05:42 Around this time capcom was like, hey, I know everyone's really excited for this whole legends 3 thing
02:05:47 Um, but we never said that we were gonna make this game and he's like, huh
02:05:52 Uh, and so it turns out they never actually officially greenlit the game
02:05:57 So everyone was like, what the hell you made this dev room? There's all these materials made for it
02:06:01 There's like clearly like a demo being developed. Um, and the demo for the game
02:06:06 Uh, was going to be its own little contained story and just kind of like kind of like what they did with two because in
02:06:12 They had the japanese only um, like demo game
02:06:15 It never got ported to america for some reason. We never got to play roles critical moment
02:06:20 I yeah where she gets tied up and she's in a crate and you can choose to join tronbon in that mission
02:06:26 It's really funny. It sounds it sounds awesome. Yeah, but yeah, so it was going to be its own story
02:06:30 But like literally its own prologue story
02:06:33 Um, we're like if you play legends 3 and you didn't play the demo you're going to be like, huh?
02:06:38 Like it's just legends 3 was just going to pick up as its own thing
02:06:41 And the prologue was going to cover
02:06:44 Um the build up to them launching the rocket and getting him off the moon
02:06:47 So that was just confirmed. Um, there's other story details, which um
02:06:52 I cannot talk about on the podcast because I've been sworn to secrecy about it
02:06:56 And I might actually get someone in trouble if I do wait really
02:06:59 Yes, I wow
02:07:01 I know some things of it. Well now you well now you got to tell well now you got to tell. I'm sorry
02:07:05 You got to tell us that you got to tell us. You got to tell us. You got to spill the beans
02:07:08 You got to spill the beans
02:07:10 All listen, I don't want to have to deal with the bean spillage, but uh, that's gonna be I will tell you one thing. All right. Um,
02:07:17 There was a fan theory based on
02:07:20 The character barrel and Barrett
02:07:23 That people guessed pretty much right away and I'm just going to say that that fan theory
02:07:27 Was on to something and I will say nothing else
02:07:30 So that's that's as much as I can say because I don't want to get someone in trouble
02:07:33 Is who's Barrett?
02:07:35 He's the red haired guy that you were going to play as in the demo
02:07:38 Oh, he was from the next game. He was from three
02:07:41 He was from three where he can like run up the walls and he has like the cool boots
02:07:44 And he does like awesome flying kicks and stuff. He was really awesome. He rides the really sick nasty motorcycle
02:07:49 It's it's cool. Is he on the is he like on the cover art or like the
02:07:53 Yeah, he's there was lots of art of him. Actually. It's really a shame that he didn't you know, yeah
02:07:58 Well, I didn't yeah
02:07:59 But anyway, I'm this is besides the point of how we're supposed to be on mighty number nine
02:08:03 I'm just saying that um legends had a lot of love in it. Keiji Inafune is not a horrible person
02:08:09 Like everyone makes him out to be he really really he did a lot of damage to his reputation with the whole mighty number
02:08:14 He did and so what happened was is capcom was like
02:08:18 um
02:08:19 He this is how this all went down and this is where things start to fall apart for Inafune and everything else
02:08:24 um
02:08:26 Capcom was like we never said we were going to make legends
02:08:30 Three we never said we were actually going to do that. You just kind of got that in your head
02:08:34 Um, but we we never agreed to it. We never actually said we were going to do that
02:08:38 um
02:08:39 So he's like, okay. Well, I would like to form my own studio
02:08:43 Within capcom because he's like I'm at the top like Inafune. I am telling you was like literally
02:08:48 The top executive at capcom. You could not go any higher
02:08:51 It was him and a bunch of other people who managed the company
02:08:55 But they're like not game developers like he was like where he worked his way up from like, you know, just an artist
02:09:00 um
02:09:01 So he's like I want to make my own game studio. Uh, I want to get back to making games
02:09:06 He's like I'll take a pay cut. I'll demote myself whatever it is. I just want to make games again
02:09:10 I don't want to be at the top here. I can't do anything anymore. Yeah, and capcom basically said no way
02:09:16 We're not giving you your own studio. You're going to stay right where you are and you're going to like it
02:09:20 So he said well in that case I'm going to finish up
02:09:24 All of my currently open projects and I'm going to resign from capcom
02:09:28 He's like I want to finish the projects that I'm on, you know, I don't want to like leave them
02:09:33 You know, he thought he was doing something nice by saying that by saying like well, I started all these projects
02:09:38 I don't want to like just drop them. That would be stupid. Yeah capcom said and I quote
02:09:43 That will not be necessary and then fired him and wow
02:09:47 He was kicked out of capcom people say that he resigned and like yeah, that's true
02:09:51 He was intending to resign
02:09:53 But what really happened is when he had this conversation with capcom
02:09:56 And they denied him the studio to develop game like kind of like how the clover studios was like
02:10:02 A studio that even though they were their own devs, they like worked under capcom
02:10:06 Clover is the one that made a okami, right? Okami beautiful show godhand and then they eventually went on to go
02:10:14 Become platinum games and stuff. Yeah, platinum. Yeah, right
02:10:16 So he kind of wanted the same deal
02:10:18 He wanted his own studio within capcom to make games the way that they did because he wants to get back in like the
02:10:23 You know creative aspect of it, but they basically said no way and he said okay. Well once I finish all of these games
02:10:29 I'm going to
02:10:30 Respectfully resign because I want to make my own game studio where I can develop games how I want
02:10:36 And capcom basically even the boot and they said no
02:10:39 so
02:10:40 Around this time is what mega man fans. I don't think we have a term for it
02:10:44 But this was like the great cancellation of 2011. Yeah, we're basically legends three got canceled mega man universe got canceled
02:10:51 um
02:10:52 And then we've later come to find out that a whole bunch of other on like unannounced mega man games got canceled like star force
02:10:59 four
02:11:00 And that maverick hunter first person shooter game got canceled
02:11:03 It was just they were just cancelling mega man games left right and center. It was really bad. Um, so then a little bit after that
02:11:10 uh
02:11:10 Inafuna founds his own company
02:11:13 that maverick hunter game
02:11:14 I that looks so ridiculous. It's like I actually
02:11:18 It on the one hand it sort of is it leaves a bad taste in my mouth like why would they do that?
02:11:23 But on the other hand, it's just so absurd that like I kind of would have like
02:11:26 Yeah, I what would it what would that have been like?
02:11:29 And you know what?
02:11:30 People again always give unifunny lots of crap for this because they're like, oh, he's a hack
02:11:33 He doesn't know what he's doing and I'm like, no, he's actually kind of ahead of his time
02:11:36 He wanted to do mega man universe and there there is a story by um, it's an article by protodude
02:11:42 uh, brian on twitter who um
02:11:46 He basically, you know spilled the beans about the development of mega man universe and yeah
02:11:50 Inafuna really kind of mishandled it
02:11:51 But he had a great idea that he just didn't know
02:11:55 How to like manage it and so the project fell apart
02:11:58 But it was basically mega man maker like like mario maker before that so the idea
02:12:03 Was brilliant. It's it's not it's not a it's not a terrible idea. Just yeah, and then on top of that
02:12:10 Mega man x maverick hunter whatever the hell it was going to be called first person thing
02:12:16 Yeah, um, if you look at it, it actually plays very similar to doom 2016
02:12:21 Where you run around in the first person mode you're shooting enemies
02:12:25 And then you do what is effectively a glory kill on them and use take their weapon and ammo
02:12:30 Which is exactly how the mechanic works in doom 2016
02:12:34 So i'm not saying that like they copied them or anything, but i'm saying like the idea was there
02:12:39 And it i'm sure if we got to play it it probably would have felt pretty decent to play
02:12:44 It's unfortunately i'm not a chance. I would i would have given i would have given it a fair shake
02:12:49 I really would have yeah, i was against it at first because i'm like this looks stupid
02:12:53 But then i was like well it does look pretty stupid though
02:12:56 But but i was also kind of open to new ideas at the time where i'm like, you know
02:13:00 It's a it's just a new interpretation of mega man like i used to be against battle network
02:13:04 But that grew on me and became one of my favorite series. Um, but anyway again i'm sidetracking here
02:13:08 So i mean that's how i felt it's how i felt about legends too like before i played
02:13:13 Exactly i think everyone should just be open-minded to give everything a fair shake. Yeah, so
02:13:18 Uh, he forms concept after he gets let go from capcom capcom cancels everything he he even admits
02:13:24 He goes it's my he i think in one thing he said
02:13:28 um, it is my biggest regret that i left capcom when i did because
02:13:33 I feel bad for the fans that were expecting these games that will never forget them and he said something kind of charming once he said
02:13:41 um
02:13:43 He's someone asked him something like if you had all the dragon balls
02:13:46 What would your one wish be and he said his one wish would be to release legends 3
02:13:49 Oh god
02:13:52 And i'm like man
02:13:54 Geez because he was he have to understand he was like asked about it for years
02:13:58 When is legends 3 coming when it's legends 3 coming people on his team were just
02:14:02 Taking their time to make demos for like a potential legends 3 proof of concept and he's like it's not in my hands
02:14:08 I can't do anything about it guys like i can't green light the game
02:14:11 So when legends 3 and universe and all that other stuff happened
02:14:15 He basically was kind of throwing around his executive weight because he was at a point now where he could do that
02:14:21 as a matter of fact this
02:14:23 Inafune was kind of infamous for this within capcom internally
02:14:27 where he would
02:14:29 basically
02:14:30 Greenlight a game and dump a ton of budget into it so that capcom couldn't cancel it
02:14:35 Because it would basically it would be like, you know, so like we spent too much on it already
02:14:41 We can't lose that investment. I think so for instance dead rising, right?
02:14:47 He goes he goes to capcom execs and he's like hey listen guys. I want to make a zombie game
02:14:51 I'm paraphrasing but this is more or less what you said
02:14:53 I want to make a zombie game and they said we already have resident evil and he goes no no no not like horror
02:15:00 survival uh game i want to make
02:15:02 Uh a different kind of zombie game
02:15:04 Uh one where and he basically describes dead rising
02:15:08 And they were like no, that's a dumb idea. We already have we already have a flagship zombie game
02:15:12 We're not going to make another one that doesn't make any sense
02:15:15 So he said okay, and then he just started development on dead rising anyway
02:15:19 And then threw a bunch of money behind it and capcom was like listen man
02:15:22 This better be a successful game because you know if it's not you're going to be in a lot of trouble and he goes
02:15:26 Yeah, okay, okay
02:15:27 Well for dead rising games later and I would say that it was a pretty big success everyone loved dead rising when it came out
02:15:32 Yeah, um they just sort of petered off at the end there because they went to different developers
02:15:37 But you know it was still a good it was a success
02:15:40 Um, then he said hey, you know what we don't have any shooter games
02:15:44 And capcom said shooter games are for americans. We're not we're not a western developer. We're not going to make
02:15:49 First person shooters and he goes yeah, I know but I want to make like a japanese
02:15:53 Shooter game like what would a japanese developed shooter game look like because at the time they really weren't any
02:16:00 Yeah, and so he basically pitched lost planet and they were like no no no that's stupid
02:16:06 We're not going to do that just let the western developers do that
02:16:09 So he goes okay, and then he threw a bunch of money behind it and I remember
02:16:13 I don't remember which game came first if it was dead rising or lost planet
02:16:16 But I know the second time he did that capcom said to him if this game is not successful
02:16:22 You were going to be let go. We're going to fire you for wasting all of our money
02:16:26 And of course both games were a success so that didn't happen
02:16:30 Um, so that was you know how how how delightful
02:16:34 So he's pretty ballsy when it comes to that sort of thing
02:16:36 So basically what happened was is third time's the charm
02:16:39 He tries to do that for mega man and he'd green light
02:16:42 I guess not green lights, but he works on all of these mega man projects and capcom basically said all right
02:16:48 That's enough. We don't care for if it's going to waste our money. We're just going to cancel all these games
02:16:52 So that's what they did. They said we got to put a stop to this. He's he's basically throwing around our money
02:16:58 And we don't want to gamble with this money because if mega man doesn't do well
02:17:04 You know we'll have wasted all this money and the same thing with legends 3
02:17:08 The legend series historically has not ever really sold all that well despite the fact that it's very popular
02:17:13 It is a cult series
02:17:15 So um, they were like we're not going to take a chance on legends 3 and they just they cancelled it
02:17:20 So fast forward to mighty number nine. He makes concept. Uh, and he's basically like hey, I just started a brand new company
02:17:26 I don't really have the capital to make anything yet. Um, but I'm going to do Kickstarter
02:17:31 Uh, and the Kickstarter campaign went
02:17:33 Really well at first and it got funded like immediately and everyone was super hype
02:17:38 Uh, and he basically is like I'm going to give people
02:17:42 The mega man that capcom won't give them. I'm going to make a mega. I'm going to make a new mega man game
02:17:47 I'm going to make a new tv show. I'm going to make merchandise. I'm going to make all these different things
02:17:52 Um that I've always wanted to do at capcom, but they would never let me do it
02:17:56 Because they were always like controlling everything
02:17:59 And that's where things start to fall apart in so many words
02:18:01 He basically bit off way more than he could chew and I just don't think he understands how
02:18:06 Like crowdsourcing looks to people it's bad optics when you crowdsource the game
02:18:12 And then you're like not delivering on certain things or you're late on delivering things or things don't come out
02:18:17 The way that you promised
02:18:19 Um, you know for me personally
02:18:22 I think I donated like 80 bucks
02:18:24 Uh, that's all I could afford at the time
02:18:25 I would have donated more at the time and I still would have donated more even today knowing everything that happened
02:18:31 I still really did believe in this project and I looked at it as like a donation
02:18:35 I didn't look at it as like an investment like most people did I was like
02:18:39 I'm going to donate this money to it and I'm like if the game sucks a game sucks
02:18:42 But I love the guy and I'm willing to give him a chance
02:18:45 um, so
02:18:48 I can't even describe the entire
02:18:51 Debacle with the Kickstarter because I know what do I know about it?
02:18:54 I mean, I know that not all of it was his fault, but he did take the fall for a lot of it
02:18:58 So I know that people didn't I feel I guess I feel a bit bad saying that the game sucks. I I haven't played it
02:19:04 That's just what and so that's the thing. I played the game and I love it. It's a great game. It's not perfect
02:19:10 It's got a few things wrong
02:19:12 But it's it sets such a great foundation for what could be an amazing game
02:19:18 I mean mega man one was bad
02:19:20 That's exactly what I said. I'm like mega man one was bad. But you know what we have and I I again, I'm not trying to
02:19:27 Uh to again like glorify Inafune and like lick his asshole over here, but mega man one
02:19:33 Like sucked and capcom just didn't want to release it again. They were like
02:19:38 Mega man's dead franchise. Whatever. It's stupid and Inafune and Keita mora basically put their heads together
02:19:43 And they said no, listen, this could be something really great. This is actually a lot of fun
02:19:46 It's got a lot of potential
02:19:47 and the the success story of mega man is that
02:19:50 Capcom basically told them you can work on making a sequel to mega man as long as you do it in your spare time
02:19:55 And it doesn't cut into this other fantastic game that we're going to be working on
02:20:00 I think it was like a baseball murder mystery game. I don't know something's stupid
02:20:03 Okay
02:20:05 And so they said, all right, cool. And they literally worked on mega man two
02:20:09 Inafune, Keita mora and their team made mega man two in their spare time and it exploded
02:20:15 I've heard uh, I've heard this one. I've heard that the rest is history. You know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
02:20:21 So, you know
02:20:22 I was always of the mindset. Okay. Money number nine is not a perfect game
02:20:26 But neither was mega man one and I'm like just look at what happened when mega man two came out, you know
02:20:31 Um, and so a lot of people
02:20:33 I think were tainted by
02:20:36 How poorly the Kickstarter was handled. There was a lot of things that went wrong with it
02:20:39 Which I'm not even going to make excuses for there's lots of people out there who think that I'm like an Inafune like, you know
02:20:44 Bible thumper or something. Uh-huh like I I'm sorry, but the guy gave me like 25 years of mega man and he definitely
02:20:51 He definitely made some mistakes. You know, he definitely made some mistakes
02:20:54 I'm not going to like say that he didn't but he was also responsible
02:20:59 For a lot of good that
02:21:01 You know helped me
02:21:03 Grow up as a person and like gave me so many years of you like you don't you don't just fail to the top of the company
02:21:08 You know what? I mean, he didn't just
02:21:10 Screw up like not not when you're like creative director and you're like
02:21:15 Yeah, he he did worked his way up from like he was just like a like a concept artist. He was an artist
02:21:20 That's all he did. He just did the art for mega man one as far. I think that's what he started as
02:21:24 It was actually pretty ridiculous that that's like he's he started where he started and then he
02:21:30 Yeah, he was literally at the top. There were no more promotions for him
02:21:34 He could not go any higher in cabcom
02:21:36 Which is why he's just started throwing his weight around to make creative decisions about games and stuff and of course the other
02:21:43 Executives who are not game developers didn't like that, you know
02:21:48 So, you know, that's just how it is. So so he made a lot of mistakes, but mining number nine
02:21:53 I don't think was one of them. I think it's actually a competent game
02:21:56 It plays really well
02:21:57 And I think a lot of the issues that people have with it come from
02:22:01 their their preconceptions about a mega about about it being a successor to mega man and also
02:22:07 A lot of people have a bad taste in their mouth from how badly he botched the kickstarter towards the latter half of things
02:22:14 Um and other decisions that he made which of course I don't agree with and I think were dumb
02:22:18 But I don't think he was acting maliciously
02:22:20 And I think that's the problem is that a lot of people
02:22:23 attribute his his bad decisions to
02:22:26 Like maliciously trying to scam people out of their life. Yeah, he was scamming people or he was like
02:22:32 I'm like, you know deliberately making false promises or something and I'm like, oh, I'm like, wow, you know
02:22:38 Last I checked scams are usually profitable for the person running the scam
02:22:42 He scammed himself right into bankruptcy. So I guess, you know, what a good guide a scam artist who takes himself out
02:22:49 Like what do you you know?
02:22:50 So, um
02:22:52 But mighty number nine itself as a game. I think is a lot of fun. It's very fast-paced
02:22:56 Like I feel like I'm playing mega man x1 or like the super nintendo x games because of how the dash mechanic works
02:23:02 It's very fast very fluid
02:23:04 And I think just too many people don't understand what they were going for the comparison that I make a lot of times is that
02:23:11 mighty number nine's dash mechanic
02:23:14 Is to mega man as the egg throwing mechanic in yoshi's island is to mario
02:23:19 It would be like if you played yoshi's island and you were like, why do I have to throw eggs?
02:23:24 It's a mario game. I just want to jump on people like well, okay
02:23:28 Sure, but you have to kind of learn the mechanics of the game to get the most out of it. Otherwise, you're
02:23:33 Is there something weird about mighty's dash?
02:23:36 Well, the dash itself feels great
02:23:38 But the way that you kill enemies in mighty number nine is you shoot them enough times and then they like destabilize
02:23:44 Like they get stunned and there's like a big blue aura around them
02:23:48 And it has a humongous hitbox and all you have to do is dash in their general direction and you like absorb them
02:23:54 And when you do that it like refills your health or it can give you points or it can give you like power ups
02:23:59 Um, each one does like a different thing
02:24:03 Um, and so that's how you actually defeat enemies
02:24:05 Now if you don't shoot them, which I don't know why you would you can sit there and just leave them alone
02:24:10 And they'll kind of just blow up on their own or if you keep shooting them
02:24:14 They'll eventually blow up because you've shot them too many times
02:24:17 So the idea is to hit them enough times to stun them and then dash through them
02:24:21 And so a perfect screen of mighty number nine would be
02:24:26 Lining up your shots stunning all the enemies on the screen and then dashing through them in like one smooth motion
02:24:31 Like doing a dash on the ground getting a first couple ones doing a dash jump into the air
02:24:35 So that you're lined up with the next ones that were maybe like floating and then doing an air dash through that one
02:24:40 So you do like a nice like s-motion
02:24:42 Through the screen and you've absorbed everyone on the screen. I didn't know any of this. I thought it was just exactly like mega man
02:24:48 No, so it it the way that it works is that you basically
02:24:52 Stun the enemies and then absorb them and when you absorb them they'll often give you like a power up and usually these power ups
02:24:58 Are consistent
02:25:00 So for one you'll like beat a guy and he'll give you like a speed power up or your speed is doubled for like clinics
02:25:05 However, many seconds. I think it's like 30 seconds
02:25:08 And then they'll give you a set of screens
02:25:11 Which you can make it through on your own, but now that you have the speed power up
02:25:15 There's an obvious like pattern like yeah, you ever watch like speed running how people say
02:25:20 Oh, you want to get on like a good cycle and then you can like get through it
02:25:24 Yes, that's how the game is
02:25:25 That's how the game is set up
02:25:27 They want you to get that like when power up and get through the screen on the right cycle
02:25:31 And then if you don't well, you can just get through it, but you're gonna do it slower or do it the hard way
02:25:35 I got you
02:25:37 I got same thing with like a like an attack power up the attack power up lets your shots travel through enemies and deal more
02:25:43 Damage and so you'll get an attack power up on the previous screen
02:25:47 But then on the next one they will purposely set up enemies that are set up
02:25:50 Like three in a row so that you can't hit the ones behind them
02:25:54 But now that you have the attack power up you can hit that entire row in like one shot
02:25:59 And so you can absorb all of them at once and it's it's you know, you're making me curious
02:26:03 You're making you're making me want to give it a try maybe you absolutely should
02:26:07 I think even as just if you're just a mega man fan. I still think you should play mighty number nine
02:26:11 Um, it feels great on pc. I should note on pc is how I would do it
02:26:17 I will not defend the fact that mighty number nine has some
02:26:21 It's only in like a few places. So I guess it's kind of a defense some really random performance issues and like a few very specific
02:26:29 Parts of the game never enough that I felt it was game breaking
02:26:32 But just for no reason the screen will it'll just chug for some reason in like a few
02:26:37 Sparse areas, but on pc. I never ran into that issue. So maybe maybe I could um,
02:26:42 Maybe uh, it's giving me an idea. Maybe if I could get my internet sorted out a little
02:26:46 A little just make sure I wouldn't have it. Maybe I could like stream myself playing uh
02:26:51 I say go into a one bust out the old twitch bust out the old twitch stream
02:26:56 Not you dust it off. Yeah, no no relation and no relation and uh, uh, maybe I could stream mighty number nine
02:27:03 That might be fun. I'll be funny. I think it's worth it. Um, I think
02:27:07 And you know, I don't know what else this is blasphemous for me to say
02:27:09 I think money number nine does certain things better than megaman 11. Oh my god. I know that's horrible, but
02:27:16 So mega man 11 has
02:27:19 And I I know the irony of this when I say it it has very robotic animations for mega man
02:27:25 He moves very like there's a there's a youtube video about the animations of mega man. Have you seen that one?
02:27:34 I've seen that one from eight bits or like 11. He did the whole thing
02:27:37 Yeah, I don't I don't remember what his name is. But yeah, I I have um
02:27:41 Seeing a breakdown of like all the different like the different ways that he's animated across the different games
02:27:46 It was really. Yeah, it was a great video. Yeah
02:27:50 Um, but in mega man 11 your run sprite or your run animation
02:27:54 I should say is the thing that you're going to see the most in the game and it is so
02:27:59 Robotic and like stiff and gross and I'm like, what is this? Um
02:28:05 And also when you shoot
02:28:08 Like the shots are kind of weird like they kind of like hover in place
02:28:12 Like they like they like hover in place or follow your buster or something like that
02:28:16 And the shots don't kind of like come out the way that they're supposed to
02:28:20 Like the muzzle flash and the resulting shot don't line up correctly in mega man 11 somehow
02:28:26 I didn't know why or how they did that
02:28:28 Uh, I probably notice what you're talking about if I went back and I looked for it
02:28:32 Right. Um, but in mighty number nine does there's like no robotic animation the animations for beck. That's the that's mighty number nine
02:28:40 He he moves
02:28:42 So fluidly and so smoothly like when he's running
02:28:46 He's got like a lot of weight to him and it's like very animated
02:28:49 Um, if you jump and like there's lots of like squash and stretch because like their limbs are kind of like a little stretchy like cartoony
02:28:55 Um
02:28:56 When he jumps he kind of stretches out the right way and then he kind of like snaps back up to like the rest of his mass
02:29:01 When he's at like the top of his jump
02:29:03 If you're running forward and you jump and then land he does like a little stumble before getting back to his full run
02:29:09 It doesn't even like affect gameplay
02:29:12 Because like he does like it's only if you're holding forward when you land that he does like the stumble
02:29:17 Um, so if you just let go of forward you can just land
02:29:20 Completely straight like, you know, precisely
02:29:22 Um, the dash feels really good like he turns into this cool like data form and like he stretches out until he's like long blue thingy
02:29:30 It's really it the game just looks and feels so nice. I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm
02:29:36 I'm gonna have to check it out now
02:29:38 I kind of had written it off just based on its reputation, but uh
02:29:42 And that's the thing a lot of people do and I'm like, you know, it's such it's got such a good potential though
02:29:48 um
02:29:49 The animations are leaps and bounds better than mecha. They release that when they release that trailer that said
02:29:54 Something about an anime fan on prom night. I was so personally insulted that I just like
02:30:00 Believe he would say that about me. I think I forgot that was that was that you know what?
02:30:04 I a lot of people were really butthurt about that and I was like, I mean, it's pretty it's pretty cringy joke
02:30:09 Like it's not a funny joke, but like it's it's not that funny. I don't care. I don't care
02:30:14 I but there was actually people who did care and they were like really personally offended and I'm like guys
02:30:21 I'm an anime fan and it's my prom night. Why would you say that?
02:30:25 I'm like you guys would not have survived the advertisement in
02:30:29 for games in uh
02:30:31 In the 90s like I watched
02:30:33 Uh collection
02:30:34 I open up my magazine to see I open up a game informer to see an ad for earthbound
02:30:40 That says this game stinks and I say, how could they say that? How could they say that about a video?
02:30:46 I like video games and they're insulting one
02:30:50 Disgusting. Okay. Okay. So here's an example of some edgy 90s advertisement
02:30:55 And this is for when I watched a collection of uh ps1 commercials
02:30:59 Um, just you know as you do. It's funny like I in the digital age
02:31:02 We all want to avoid advertisements and yet here I am
02:31:06 Watching them on purpose. No, I hear yet ads ads in the 90s were
02:31:11 Really strange and I I hazely remember them like like a dream like a nightmare that I woke up from
02:31:18 So there's one for metal gear solid
02:31:21 I don't even have to tell you the pedigree of this game. Everyone knows how
02:31:26 The the legacy of metal gear solid and how it taught me that love can bloom on the battlefield
02:31:31 Exactly. So you already know the advertisement for it. Uh, I remember
02:31:37 It's it's a soldier and he's doing like push-ups and jumping jacks
02:31:41 and there's like
02:31:42 There's like a drill sergeant and like a higher up in like a business suit or something
02:31:46 And the the drill sergeant is like drop and give me 50. He's like doing all the things or whatever. Um, and um
02:31:55 he's like
02:31:57 The the soldier is like struggling to keep up with the exercises and it's interspliced with um,
02:32:02 You know gameplay footage and this and that or whatever
02:32:05 Um, and then the the higher up the big general guy leans over and he goes
02:32:10 Are you sure this is the right man for the job? And he's like, yes, don't worry about it general
02:32:15 It's a suicide mission anyway
02:32:17 And then the the soldier guy looks at the screen and it zooms in and he's like, huh?
02:32:22 And then it cuts to I don't even know if this is anywhere in the game, but it cuts to snake
02:32:27 There's an explosion and snakes character model flails through the air and like smacks into the camera and i'm like
02:32:34 What the hell am I watching? I don't know what they were
02:32:38 What was the I don't know. Yeah, the wet western marketing for games and that era was just so like it was they
02:32:45 They insulted you for wanting to play the game and then insulted you if you didn't play the game
02:32:49 So you can never quite tell so when I saw the money
02:32:52 I'm feeling this probably just like two guys that are like the result like the reason all advertising was like
02:32:59 Yeah, so it's just sort of like oh somebody had like a success with some weird ad. Let's all copy them
02:33:06 Yeah, let's all be fucked up
02:33:08 So when I saw that advertising campaign for money number nine
02:33:11 I just laughed I was like, haha, I get it like they're they're going for like this is stupid self-referential like edgy humor
02:33:18 You know, so like it was nothing new to me because I grew up with that kind of stuff
02:33:22 So I was like whatever like it's just it's a riff on
02:33:25 Self-deprecating self-referential stuff. Do I think it was the right move?
02:33:30 No, but I also don't think it was as agreed just as people make it out to be
02:33:33 Yeah, it's it's whatever
02:33:36 It's but separate from that. Let's separate
02:33:40 I ask I implore not ask I implore everyone to please give the game
02:33:45 A shot with no preconceptions. Um, it's always on sale for like a few bucks on steam
02:33:51 You know, it's I will buy the game for people who want to play it ben
02:33:55 I will buy you mighty number nine. No fucking way
02:33:59 I will I know
02:34:02 I'm dipping really deep into the maverick hunter reserves right
02:34:05 I will
02:34:06 I will buy you mighty number nine to give it a shot because I think it doesn't worth a shake
02:34:10 That would be uh, cool. I would uh, we can I can add you on steam
02:34:15 Uh, nice. Yeah, you can do that. Um, thank you. Appreciate it. Uh, oh, you know, okay
02:34:21 Not to change the subject but that reminds me, uh, gib you got to tell hgb guy
02:34:27 That I bought him a video game
02:34:30 The other day and he has not accepted it and it's gonna get refunded if he doesn't accept it
02:34:34 Yeah, oh shit. Yeah, fury fury was on sale
02:34:38 And I was like, oh, I've heard of that. It's on sale. I'll buy it and I looked at my
02:34:42 Who who else has it in their wishlist and hgb guy had it in his wishlist. So I bought it for him
02:34:47 Because he
02:34:48 Is cool and uh, but he hasn't seen it yet. I got a notification. It's like hgb guy has not accepted
02:34:54 Your gift. Ah, I'll tell him. I'll tell him. I could let him know but I won't
02:34:59 I like your initiative. That's gib's brother, by the way. That's the reason
02:35:07 Yeah, I could physically shake him and slap him over the head like
02:35:11 Yeah, get him. Make him pay attention. Yeah, get his ass. Nice. That is usually
02:35:15 That that is convenient
02:35:18 Can you have that sort of ability to do so? Um
02:35:22 Well, uh, okay, we've been all right. We've been going for three hours
02:35:26 And
02:35:27 I feel like we should start we should I'm not saying we we don't have to quit right now
02:35:30 But I do feel like we should move towards a resolution
02:35:34 Yes
02:35:35 to put it
02:35:37 Diplomatically and and and then and then 7 20
02:35:40 And then we and then we can um, we can move on to voicemails. So I don't know um
02:35:45 I
02:35:46 Guess I have um, I don't know. Is there anything else you wanted to like
02:35:50 Talk about while you were here on the on the
02:35:53 On our on our stupid little podcast
02:35:56 It's not stupid. It is. It is stupid. You idiot. All right fine. Geez. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much
02:36:06 Um, I don't know I I'm
02:36:08 I'm I'm really bad. I get the sense. I get the sensation that if we if we wanted we could
02:36:14 talk about mega man and mega man accessories for
02:36:18 Any no any length of time and literally I could talk about mega man for days
02:36:23 And I'm not saying like that as an exaggeration
02:36:25 I'm literally saying that the amount of time I could talk about mega man would exceed 24 hours consecutively
02:36:30 I feel like I had enough food and water. I could just keep going. I feel like we've only scratched the surface
02:36:36 Oh, yeah, there's there's a lot more that I would love to discuss with you
02:36:40 You have you have so many little like little examples of like, oh, yeah
02:36:44 I can bring up a very specific like a thing in a reference that was here or like the time they
02:36:49 They oh, they said this in that one time
02:36:52 Oh, yeah, just like like in in mega man legends the the this is just a little taste the z saber item or the zet saber
02:36:59 as they call it
02:37:00 Yeah, um, they say that it is a toy from a tv series called mega man zero
02:37:06 Yes, and that dates the game series mega man zero. So i'm just i'm just saying it's it really it says that
02:37:13 I remember that it's a toy. Yeah, that's so funny. It's it's in the japanese dialogue only. I think okay, okay, okay?
02:37:19 So it's interesting that they they call it. They're referencing a series called mega man zero
02:37:24 Um, like three years before mega man zero one even came out. So
02:37:29 I'm just it's crazy. There's a lot. It's crazy. Okay. There's a lot I can keep going
02:37:34 But I'm just give I'm just letting you know
02:37:35 I'm just flexing the fact that I do have lots of little things that I could go on
02:37:40 I I won't because we've been doing this for three hours. We go. I mean we we often
02:37:46 We've been we've been airing more on the short side lately, but I mean three hours is not
02:37:51 hugely unusual
02:37:52 It's not overly long. Yeah
02:37:54 Sometimes we go for
02:37:56 I don't think we've been a five hour episode yet. No, we no we definitely did we definitely made I think maybe even twice
02:38:02 It's funny because uh me and coalman were supposed to record an episode of our podcast today
02:38:08 I actually don't know what the subject is going to be
02:38:10 Um, but we're always like this will be a short one and then we always drag it out for like an hour or two
02:38:14 Is that on your youtube channel? It's actually on his
02:38:18 I was just called on as a guest and then I've become
02:38:22 The the semi permanent co-host for the show
02:38:26 Um, I just love doing it so much and he was like man, you're great. Let's just keep talking
02:38:30 So like we kind of became friends and like we've been doing it ever since
02:38:33 Wait, wait, wait. His name is was it x coals, uh, coalman x
02:38:38 Coalman x there we go. Uh, and that's his youtube channel. That's his youtube name. Um, I think if you
02:38:45 His youtube url, he's gonna kill me if I don't remember. He's not I'm just just look up rambling reploids and you'll find right there
02:38:52 We go
02:38:53 Awesome
02:38:54 Yeah, you'll find his channel that way that because we've done a lot of episodes of that and so that show up
02:38:58 I was gonna ask if you've been doing it for a while
02:39:01 We have, uh, we've been doing it for a couple years now
02:39:04 Um, we've covered lots of cool topics. He actually has a lot of interviews with
02:39:10 Some interesting people. Oh, wait. He was in he was in my chat
02:39:14 He was in my premiere chat and he mentioned to me. Oh, that was him and he mentioned to me an interview with um
02:39:21 Oh, I said I was gonna check it out. Uh
02:39:23 He he specifically mentioned one interview with
02:39:27 Someone ah darn it. I can't he's done interviews with a lot of people
02:39:30 We've talked to Ian James Corlett who was the original voice for mega man of the ruby spears cartoon. That might um
02:39:37 It was it was a voice actor
02:39:39 He wants to talk to he meant to talk to me. I don't know if we're gonna finally call in this favor
02:39:43 But we want to talk to scott mcneil who voiced protoman and dr. Wiley in the ruby spears cartoon
02:39:47 He's scott mcneil has also done like a bajillion voices. So he's done a lot of things outside of mega man
02:39:53 But we want to talk to him
02:39:55 I'm trying to remember who else he's interviewed because we've done a lot of interviews actually. So oh
02:40:00 um
02:40:01 No, that wasn't him
02:40:03 Shoot, I can't remember but yeah, um, I was gonna say check out our our channel and not not to forcibly
02:40:10 Stick a plug in here. But no, I mean by all he does cool stuff like it's all mega man related. So
02:40:16 um, we always talk about neat mega man related topics
02:40:20 Usually there's like a theme to an episode
02:40:23 Uh, he he himself gets really great interviews. So I recommend checking out the interviews
02:40:28 So it's a lot of fun. I he he mentioned that interview to me
02:40:31 And I thought to myself and I said I was gonna check that out and I wanted to check that out
02:40:35 And thank you for reminding me. I had almost forgotten. But yes, uh, that's so funny. Yeah, I will I will go
02:40:41 I will scope
02:40:43 I can't remember which which interview he he recommended to me, but I was I was gonna go I was gonna go watch it
02:40:48 And now I remember
02:40:50 Yeah, I I wasn't there for the premiere unfortunately. Um, but I mean, I couldn't that's fine sat there further
02:40:55 But you know, I watch it, you know afterwards
02:40:58 But uh, yeah, he was he was even saying, you know, I'm just gonna go ahead and throw it out there
02:41:01 Would you like to be on an episode of rambling reploids one day? You know, you know, I was I didn't know I didn't want to presume by um
02:41:09 Making that suggestion, but uh, yeah, I would I would I would guess
02:41:13 We would we would love to have you on and we could we'll
02:41:17 Much rambling will be had that would be sick. Cool. We could do that. We could do that sometime

02:41:50 No, it's all good. You know what? I've been I I've been kicked out before I totally understand it. It's been uh, it's been fun

02:42:29 Yeah, just don't do not check out reploid revo on youtube
02:42:33 I was gonna say that the one of your videos that I watched the most was the history of robotics series
02:42:38 Um, I love that one. Definitely my favorites that I've done because because that one has you know, all the like world history and stuff
02:42:43 Uh, what are the other ones that I mean, um
02:42:46 You know the who the who is x the who is zero series are just very like
02:42:50 You know, it's just very very important very important information to understand
02:42:56 um, my
02:42:58 The your iceberg your iceberg video was pretty good the the the combine. I like I like that one
02:43:05 And I like and I and I like that um the one you linked me the other day, which I had seen before the um
02:43:10 I forget what it's called
02:43:11 But the like everything that happens in the whole time skimmer everything is or time skimmer the whole thing
02:43:17 And it was an April actually all the time skimmer videos again. I watched all of those by the way
02:43:22 Well, thank you. I do appreciate it and uh, you know, I can't wait to
02:43:26 Continue on with that series. I think it's gonna be great because I wanted people are always like, why don't you talk about legends?
02:43:31 I want you to talk. It's your legends three. It's your legends three
02:43:35 It is but I'm it's not cancelled. It is coming out. Oh, it's I did complete all the editing for that video like several years ago
02:43:42 But I'll tell you what I'm announcing it here first. I always do like an end of year video, but I'll put it out there
02:43:47 Uh, I'm going to be remastering a lot of pretty much all my content. Um
02:43:52 Be it's not going to be like a crazy undertaking
02:43:55 But there are certain things that like I didn't know how to do
02:43:58 So I'm going to be re re-recording certain things because like my audio quality has now been way improved
02:44:04 Uh, and I'm also going to be fixing a lot of editing mistakes and stuff like that
02:44:07 So, um, I'll be getting to that and uh, I already finished the editing for time skimmer six
02:44:12 Years ago, and I think I'm just this is the perfect time to just start over again on it anyway. So it's coming
02:44:17 It's coming. I promise and I'm not I'm not fooling you radical
02:44:22 radical radical
02:44:23 Hell yeah, all right. It is
02:44:26 All right, it's bodacious. Uh, it's been been great. Uh
02:44:31 Now skidaddle
02:44:32 All right. All right. Take care everyone. Thank you for having me. I'll see you guys next time. Bye. Bye
02:44:37 absolutely
02:44:41 Sweet man, what a cool guy knows a lot about mega man
02:44:47 Sure does Ben. How how emasculated do you feel right now?
02:44:52 Let's not talk about it
02:44:54 somebody somebody in um
02:44:57 Somebody in I think it was either a comment or someone in the chat in the premiere asked me like
02:45:03 Ben, are you the most like do you know the most like does does anyone know as much as you about mega man?
02:45:08 And I I think as she officially said like
02:45:11 Repload Revo might know as much as me he might know as much as me
02:45:15 But I said that knowing full well like he definitely knows more than me
02:45:19 Uh, I mean I I mean I literally played some of the games for the first time ever for the um
02:45:25 Like I'd never I'd never played x5 or x6 uh before
02:45:29 Then I just do it for the video. So like I'm a freaking nerd. I only did one playthrough of x4
02:45:34 I only did the x playthrough. I didn't even do zeros playthrough zeros playthrough is like even more canon
02:45:41 I'm a I'm a baby
02:45:44 You're a fool
02:45:45 How what a what a nerd you are to not have played so much so embarrassing and I can't get a girlfriend because I didn't play
02:45:52 Both playthroughs of x4
02:45:56 Sad uh
02:45:59 Um, do you want to go to voicemails?
02:46:03 Oh, I forgot or I forgot to do my quip. I forgot to do my quip where I say
02:46:08 Where's all the mega woman, huh? But it it's time. There's one there. She's you know, there's one called splash woman
02:46:16 There's one. Oh
02:46:18 What's the difference why is she a woman because that's her name?
02:46:25 I don't know what you want me to say uh
02:46:28 Uh, she's like I'm because I because they're they're robots. They don't procreate or reploids or yeah, like
02:46:35 There's no there's no reason for them to have gender
02:46:37 But they're all I mean, I guess it's kind of like the sounds honestly
02:46:40 I think it's probably like a crystal gem thing like it kind of doesn't matter. They just all are men
02:46:45 Except for splash woman. Well
02:46:48 reploids are
02:46:49 There are more there like reploids are some of them are women like all the nap most of the navigators are women
02:46:55 Uh, what what makes them women? I don't know because they look
02:46:59 girly
02:47:01 uh
02:47:03 And then and then I think in in zero they're like
02:47:06 It's kind of just equal number
02:47:09 Yeah, I don't know all reploids start genderless and then they just pick if they feel like I feel like
02:47:15 I feel I mean, I mean most most of the like bosses are like they don't really look gendered one way or another like
02:47:22 They just look like an animal
02:47:24 But I think they tend to call them he square when they refer to them at all
02:47:28 I think they usually call most of them he I can't think of any that are called she
02:47:33 until like alia
02:47:35 in in five
02:47:37 and then
02:47:41 I don't know why they didn't you know, they they made splash woman
02:47:44 In nine and like she was cool and then they never made they didn't make it anymore. They had two more games and they didn't do any more
02:47:51 Woman and like why?
02:47:53 Why not?
02:47:55 Everybody likes splash woman
02:47:57 Well, we'll never know because uh twitches left they probably would have been able to talk honestly
02:48:03 He might have had more he honestly might have had more insight into that than me. He said he was doing he said he was working on a video
02:48:11 For his channel soon about reploids siblings
02:48:14 Which is
02:48:16 I thought that was an interesting topic because it actually is sort of like a mysterious thing
02:48:19 There are several reploids that have like siblings, but like what does that mean for a reploid?
02:48:26 You know
02:48:28 Uh, and I think it kind of varies case by case
02:48:32 I think some of them were like
02:48:34 Originally supposed to be one robot and then they sort of split into two
02:48:38 Or like the two of them are like linked by like a single, uh server or console or something like that
02:48:45 Uh
02:48:54 Well, um
02:48:56 Before we get to voicemails. I have
02:49:00 It's not really an announcement. It's just sort of a vibe. I've been on it's not really like, uh
02:49:05 I just I'm I I want to hibernate you this this winter hibernate
02:49:10 I'm getting on my hibernation. I'm gonna eat and I'm gonna sleep
02:49:15 But I'm gonna roll up in a blanket and I'm gonna not think
02:49:19 If I've had enough of the world you see, uh, okay
02:49:24 And I would I would encourage everyone also to do that
02:49:27 No more everybody everybody betray you you're fed up with this world
02:49:33 Everybody is too woke you need to get some shut I get some sleepy times
02:49:38 Hibernate just go into your cave
02:49:41 Exactly. It's it's I think it's good. I think it's what I want to do with my time, you know
02:49:49 I'm not like deliberately setting out to do that
02:49:52 But I think I kind of am subconsciously doing that because I really for like a week or more now
02:49:58 I've really needed
02:49:59 Almond milk
02:50:01 And it's literally like a 10 minute walk down the street to Trader Joe's to get some
02:50:05 But it's just a little bit cold out. It's just a little bit moderately chilly out and that's just
02:50:11 Ah, I just can't
02:50:13 I just can't do it
02:50:14 So yeah hibernate hibernation mode
02:50:17 Yeah, I think is the vibe just stack up just let's get all fat
02:50:21 Roll up and then you don't even need to leave your room
02:50:25 You don't need to leave the blanket a cave is low. You're just burn off at all low key goaded when hibernation is the vibe
02:50:34 I
02:50:36 You should tweet that I'll you know what
02:50:40 Fuck I guess I will if you
02:50:43 If you insist a cave is
02:50:47 Oh god, the caps lock was on. I can't I'm so embarrassing myself
02:50:51 Yeah, it wasn't really like the episode to talk about hibernating and there's not really much to talk about but
02:50:57 Uh, that's my that's my should I thing I'm going on. That's that's that's what I'm getting cranked on right now
02:51:02 So hibernation that's totally
02:51:06 Yeah, of course that totally totally normal totally reasonable thing to say and think
02:51:14 I I have no follow-up questions
02:51:17 Um, I feel like this phrase it needs an adjective
02:51:19 It needs to be not just a cave is it needs to be like a something cave
02:51:23 Maybe like a winter cave or like a forest cave or something. Um
02:51:28 Because greater specificity a bear hole bear hole
02:51:32 um
02:51:34 arboreal
02:51:36 Isn't would it would it be too obscure to say call it an arboreal cave?
02:51:41 Yeah, it might be I think it'll yeah, maybe a little bit. I know arboreal is a word that I've heard before
02:51:47 Yeah, maybe just winter. Maybe maybe wintery a wintery cave mystical cave
02:51:57 Uh
02:51:58 All right, I'm there we go a wintery cave is low key go to when hibernation and this is the vibe banger banger banger alert
02:52:06 banger alert
02:52:09 Okay, um
02:52:14 Well, all right, that's good a voice. I had I litter you know what I'm glad
02:52:19 nice nice
02:52:20 Have twitch on to take up so much airtime because other than the fact that like
02:52:25 The video came out and I had Thanksgiving
02:52:28 I didn't do anything. I don't have anything else to talk about
02:52:31 There's nothing else I have to bring up. Yeah. Oh, I guess on the podcast briefly
02:52:37 I I found this website or I was told about this website called itaku
02:52:41 um, which I am going to be using as
02:52:45 Oh someone
02:52:46 Showed me that I don't know what it is. It's a website
02:52:50 Uh similar ish to twitter but mostly sort of like an art
02:52:54 gallery thing
02:52:56 It's very easy to upload many images
02:53:00 And you tag you you have to tag each image at least five times to make sure that the tags are being used
02:53:06 and
02:53:08 um, it's good because it allows not safe for work. It's very
02:53:12 Very furry heavy. There's loads of furries on here
02:53:15 Which means, uh, it's probably like the best website ever
02:53:20 Because furries are insane and they they care about their their own they they care about
02:53:26 Preserving look out for their own. Yeah, they're not worried about advertisers or like stuff like that. They got a donation page
02:53:33 and I'm like twitter could go or
02:53:36 Could become like untenable
02:53:39 And I don't have any real place to host all of my art
02:53:42 Especially my not safe work art. So I'm putting it on itaku
02:53:46 I'll have a little okay
02:53:48 For any of those freaks who like that shit
02:53:51 Do you want to link it? I'm linking it right here
02:53:55 There we go
02:53:57 There's like a thing like um
02:54:00 I have a safer work profile and then a not safe for work profile which changes my avatar
02:54:05 And if you're like logged on you can switch between them
02:54:09 And so all of the things that are not safe work are tagged properly
02:54:13 Not tagged that there's like a setting and so you can't see not safe work things unless
02:54:19 You are you have the thing turned on so it's all good
02:54:24 And it's great and it's nice
02:54:27 And I feel safe. I don't feel safe posting it anything on tumblr or deviant art or fucking anywhere
02:54:33 So I'm glad this website has been
02:54:37 It exists
02:54:41 That's it uh
02:54:42 Cool. Good. Hang on. Replayed sent me twitch sent me a message and I just need to respond real quick
02:54:48 All right, let's do let's do voicemails. Um
02:54:51 You got them. All right. I think the first one is called do more
02:54:54 three two one go
02:54:56 Um, excuse me ben saint. I think you forgot to add the line between professor

02:55:13 Okay, yeah, good. I'm glad I could help. Yeah, did you forget to draw the line between
02:55:19 Wily and zero
02:55:21 Yeah, I forgot to draw the line from wily to zero. Uh, but visual stimulus is the only way I learned
02:55:27 Even though like literally the entire plot
02:55:30 of x is
02:55:32 Did you know wily made zero actually like?
02:55:37 Ah, I just forgot
02:55:39 I just forgot
02:55:41 It's fine
02:55:43 The next voicemail is a tweet. What is this? I don't I
02:55:48 Is this a real?
02:55:51 Hey, Billy, I believe at young based god g at real donald trump
02:55:57 Your dad gives good brain
02:55:59 damn
02:56:01 Okay, that's a message from young based god. He's quoting it to him. Yeah, he just says it's called genes
02:56:09 Well, I mean I get it. I get the joke. Yeah

02:56:26 Uh, next one is called wait. No
02:56:29 Well, there's um, it's an imager link
02:56:32 Okay, but there there is a voicemail attached. So let's listen to that real quick. Uh, three two one go
02:56:38 You guys always complain about twitter, but I actually love it. It's really easy. Okay. I also love it
02:56:46 I'm sad about it going
02:56:49 I say it going when it's still here, but you know, I don't I don't know if I
02:56:55 I don't know if I really
02:56:57 Love it, but I mean sure I appreciate the value that it has even though it sucks a lot of the time
02:57:03 Okay, so this image is um, this should have been obvious
02:57:09 But this is how to make twitter a good experience for you
02:57:14 Okay
02:57:15 Follow accounts worthy of your time
02:57:17 Never enter the recommended. Yeah, never browse the timeline
02:57:24 Enable this on which you like sends to you a timeline which only your belled accounts
02:57:30 Yeah, I mean, I agree. This is basically what I do
02:57:36 Honestly, I mean, I'm on twitter to see shitty political takes and get mad at them
02:57:41 Like I understand that I understand why someone wouldn't do that. But like
02:57:45 I think I would just get I would get bored of twitter if I was just like looking at art
02:57:50 I got a look at that. Look at that. Who's that? Who is she? It's bonnet with the with the the with the
02:57:58 I don't care
02:58:00 I don't care who she is
02:58:01 She can just be herself on her own damn time. No need to drag me into it
02:58:08 Bonus goth ben bigger
02:58:11 Nose piercings. Oh the the line around your eye is bigger because yeah because eyeshadow
02:58:18 mascara
02:58:20 Cool cool goth ben
02:58:23 Should make a comeback. I think
02:58:25 Yeah, um, there's a there's a youtuber whose thing is
02:58:29 Calls himself like a goth gamer
02:58:32 Honestly, he doesn't really seem very goth other than that his logo is a little bit gothy and like his
02:58:37 And then he's called he's
02:58:39 Fuck what's his name? Um
02:58:41 Um grim beard his name is grim beard
02:58:45 I've enjoyed a couple of his videos
02:58:48 Seems pretty good
02:58:49 I don't really get the goth thing, but whatever. Maybe if I saw him in real life, I would get it
02:58:54 Okay. Anyway, next one is the voicemail. It's called
02:58:57 Discuss
02:58:59 The the voicemail attached is just a a pained moan. So whatever. It's a types of pasta
02:59:05 types of pasta
02:59:07 He got spaghetti lasagna, vermicelli, macaroni. I've not heard of big olie. That's funny. It's just sort of thick spaghetti
02:59:17 Big ol I never heard of that. I saw a I saw a tweet
02:59:21 I think it was a comic. I think it was from
02:59:24 I don't remember
02:59:26 What it was some big ish comic account and they were like
02:59:31 It was a comic that was like a dad was trying to get his kid to eat pasta
02:59:34 And the pasta was like the kid the kid was like, I don't want spaghetti. I want macaroni and the dad said it's the same thing in a different shape
02:59:42 And then the italian police busted down his door and held him down
02:59:46 They were gonna beat the shit out of him, you know, I've you know, you know how it goes
02:59:51 I've eaten a lot of these I really like conch shagley
02:59:55 The conch one
02:59:57 Looks like a shell. It's quite big. Yeah. Yeah, and it's sort of the only thing that's bad about them
03:00:02 Is that they can sometimes get stuck within one of the others
03:00:06 And so you have to sort of separate them to get the sauce in but they're really nice
03:00:11 Well, let me see
03:00:12 I'm gonna I'm gonna mark all the ones that I have not eaten
03:00:16 Yeah, let me I'll also do that. I'm what the hell is I mean, okay
03:00:22 Some of these look similar enough like
03:00:24 Feel like I should be able to say I've eaten even though I technically have not
03:00:29 um
03:00:30 Well, the whole point is the they're the same thing, but they just have a different texture. So
03:00:35 I would say like what is the difference
03:00:38 What exactly is the difference between ditalini and rigatoni?
03:00:42 Um, that one's got ridges ditalini
03:00:47 What am I where is it where the hell's ditalini
03:00:50 Ditalini is on the bottom row
03:00:53 Oh, that's like a hula hoop
03:00:56 Yeah, you know, I don't know. I guess the rate on me is like the brigade they look the same except one's just got ridges on
03:01:03 Wait, is that a shortened rigatoni? I don't think usually longer than that. Was that penne?
03:01:09 No, I think that's z z d or z d or penne
03:01:13 All right, I haven't had but I've been that they're the same
03:01:17 Crosetti, it looks like a medallion. That looks interesting
03:01:22 Like what like what how would I know?
03:01:24 How would I know the difference between if I was eating stringotsi versus fettuccine?
03:01:31 I feel it's fucking same
03:01:33 The fucking same
03:01:36 Uh, because fettuccine is like flat stringotsi is so much different
03:01:41 It I mean, it just looks like fettuccine, but a little bit thinner
03:01:45 No, fettuccine is similar to tagliatelle, but they're also different. I've had both
03:01:52 You don't have enough pasta then you're you're I've actually you need more I actually think I've
03:01:58 I actually think I've
03:01:59 Wait a minute. I think I've had orzo. I've had orzo, but only in the context of
03:02:06 Um rice pilaf. Is that what that is?
03:02:10 Hang on. I think so. I think it
03:02:13 Yes, I think rice pilaf. It has the rice and it has the little pieces of pasta and I think that's orzo
03:02:19 Okay, so I can say I technically have had that one. I think I yeah, same
03:02:26 I feel like I'm just gonna go the pepper
03:02:29 In like a freaking airplane meal
03:02:32 You know what? I think I actually have had
03:02:35 most of these
03:02:36 Here's my here's my list
03:02:39 Pavette if it'll freaking load. Pavette. I
03:02:42 I'm not sure that I've had
03:02:44 I really like gemili. It's like fusilli, but it's chewier. I guess. I don't know why I don't know how it does that
03:02:52 Maybe I just cooked it albente or something
03:02:56 I made my own ravioli one time
03:02:59 It was quite difficult
03:03:01 Yes
03:03:02 I've never bothered trying to make a pasta myself. I guess ravioli is the
03:03:07 You don't need a pasta machine
03:03:09 kind of
03:03:10 What do you
03:03:13 You sort of like hand squish it
03:03:18 Okay, I think this is
03:03:20 I know I know I've seen some of these before I'm assuming that any of these that like look similar to something I've eaten
03:03:26 That that I've eaten them
03:03:29 Like I don't know if I've specifically had barbina before
03:03:33 But like I look at it like I get it
03:03:35 I'm like pretty pretty sure I've had something very similar to that Italian police are coming. They're knocking on your door right now
03:03:41 Yeah, I think so
03:03:44 Ah filesia or how have you say these things? I like that. I know I've had that before
03:03:50 Well, they got in in asia. They just got rice
03:03:54 They don't they can't turn their rice into funny shapes get out of here
03:03:59 Uh
03:04:02 Uh
03:04:04 No more
03:04:06 No more italian. No more
03:04:09 Next one is called mega man one exclamation point one one
03:04:13 exclamation point exclamation point three two one go
03:04:19 I cannot believe that then seen
03:04:23 Forgot to draw the one line
03:04:25 That's so important
03:04:27 Which connects the fact that spoiler alert
03:04:31 Dr. Wiley did in fact create zero
03:04:35 What a that's another line line hater
03:04:42 I don't know what I was thinking. I don't I don't know what what's even the point of the board if I'm not going to draw
03:04:47 The line from wiley to zero
03:04:49 It really ruins everything you should start over it really did it literally ruins everything literally it just invalidates the entire concept
03:04:56 Yeah
03:04:59 It's so stupid. Did I mention last week that I was thinking I should try to raffle off the uh
03:05:05 Yeah, yeah, you could mention it. What if I tried to sell the um the the the paper on ebay
03:05:12 That'd be really funny
03:05:13 Oh, but then they'd be they'd be mad that the line isn't written
03:05:16 But you can't like edit it because it wouldn't be in the video you'd invalidate it. Well, I could
03:05:21 Yeah, I would ask I mean if they wanted me to draw the line on it
03:05:25 I would happily do that if they wanted it as
03:05:28 As it was in the video that would be okay too
03:05:31 Actually, but I might have I might have drawn the line on after the fact. I'm not I don't
03:05:37 Did I dream that I don't know
03:05:40 Having a dream like you got the comment you realized you you forgot the line and then in your dreams you have to fix the problem
03:05:47 I I specifically call attention to the fact that I didn't draw the line in the video. So I
03:05:54 That's why people are commenting about it. It's because I said, please don't make fun of me for it
03:06:01 But they didn't listen
03:06:03 Uh, next one is called. Where was I?
03:06:08 Uh, el piezo from mega man at reploids on the web.gov three two one go
03:06:14 So I have just listened to the new mega man lecture by ben saint and I thoroughly enjoyed it
03:06:21 However, I cannot believe that people would simply paint el piezo as a pure villain with no good ideas
03:06:29 Because like the absolute naivete involved in saying on the other hand like oh, no
03:06:37 We'll just give them the new energy source and then everything will be hunky dory like bro
03:06:43 the inherent racism and like
03:06:46 Dehumanization involved in in the first place thinking of reploids is completely disposable in the phase of an energy crisis
03:06:54 Is like not going to go away if you offer them exactly what they want and need like
03:07:01 That's just going to make you seem like even more of a fucking tool like a complete cuck
03:07:07 That is just going to get rolled over and the next time there's an emergency
03:07:11 El piezo was fucking right
03:07:15 I think yeah
03:07:17 El piezo is the villain of that game, but he's not really a villain until the baby elves drive him insane
03:07:23 So I would I I agree
03:07:26 El piezo had a point even though it didn't work out and his efforts failed. Yeah, I'm see I'm team el piezo
03:07:32 El piezo sounds like a pastor
03:07:35 It does
03:07:37 I think it's greek or I think it's derived from a greek word
03:07:40 um
03:07:42 the
03:07:43 What else was going to say about that?
03:07:46 I mean, I guess maybe maybe under copy x if there was no if there was no energy crisis
03:07:52 I mean, maybe the worst of the
03:07:54 robot apartheid
03:07:56 would have abated
03:07:57 I mean, obviously once vile was back there was no
03:08:01 There was no fixing that situation
03:08:03 I it definitely would have maybe there was a time when it might have
03:08:07 somewhat improved the situation to give them the seal system, but
03:08:12 By the time they actually had at that time was definitely passed
03:08:15 um
03:08:17 Next one
03:08:20 Actually, I get actually
03:08:24 Get actually in in in zero two
03:08:27 Harpuya is the head of the government
03:08:30 So like our and harpuya is a good guy. He's like a reasonable guy. Maybe harpuya could have been reasoned with
03:08:36 Hmm. So at the time when operation right district was happening
03:08:40 Maybe cl that was like the time when it was like most likely that cl would have been right
03:08:45 so
03:08:46 in that
03:08:47 light
03:08:49 Maybe okay
03:08:51 Okay, anyway, uh next one is called uh x 000 x 3 2 1 go
03:08:59 If nate were in this episode, what would the title and thumbnail be?
03:09:03 I don't fucking know what the fuck kind of question is that
03:09:07 It'll be uh the same but with the word nate somewhere in the title
03:09:11 I I don't I already I don't even know what the title is going to be
03:09:16 As it is ellie is our comes up with those later. So
03:09:20 mega mega man
03:09:23 maratham
03:09:25 Uh discussion. No, that sucks. It would be called losing our virginity
03:09:30 With mega
03:09:34 Losing our minds
03:09:37 Yeah, that's just the show. Okay next one is called
03:09:41 Ben's weekly reminder play delta room chapter two. Okay, Ben's weekly reminder to keep up to date with one piece
03:09:47 Okay, there wasn't a new episode or there wasn't a new chapter this week
03:09:50 No, well or there was but I don't I think it was last week. Yeah, we did it last week. I think
03:09:57 Yeah, I can't find another one
03:09:59 On the website that I was looking at last week the one that we reviewed last week came out like
03:10:05 That morning or the night before the episode. So
03:10:09 Yeah, this week between then and now there was not a new one that dropped. Otherwise we would discuss it
03:10:16 Um, it's probably out by the time you're listening to this which is probably that's just how it's gonna be
03:10:22 Don't they usually drop in like the middle of the week? I don't yeah, I think it's
03:10:26 Generally been Wednesday, but like I I don't know like what's the official
03:10:33 Thing the official thing on vis is different from how
03:10:37 Quickly some of the scanners can get the scans early. So it's like
03:10:41 Generally been Wednesday, but I don't actually know
03:10:47 Maybe there was like an early leak of the last chapter or something perhaps
03:10:52 Um
03:10:53 But anyway, yeah, I'm up to date. I'm staying up to date
03:10:57 Next one is called i o I a a i o you
03:11:01 I guess i o three two one go
03:11:05 Uh, I need to know your
03:11:09 Opinion on tapas.io is a comic website
03:11:14 Tapas I was pretending to open my shit on it in
03:11:18 years, I don't know
03:11:20 But did you never mention it because it is cringe or you'll never heard of it? Should I keep it? I I've um
03:11:29 I don't like it. I've never I've never I've never had any success posting there
03:11:34 Neither have I it's just it's fine. I think it's just sort of like not really a site I go to
03:11:41 to read things
03:11:44 um
03:11:46 I don't know. It's nothing too much to complain about. I just got like tired
03:11:50 Like posting a chapter of a thing on one like webtoon
03:11:56 and my what my website and tapas
03:12:00 And I'm like, oh fuck it
03:12:03 It's too many things
03:12:05 I'd rather do nothing at all
03:12:08 Post to my website and then link that in social media and that
03:12:12 works fine
03:12:13 I never I never got any like views
03:12:16 posting stuff that I drew to tapas or to
03:12:20 webtoon mary like says
03:12:23 mary loves webtoon
03:12:25 But I mean mary I don't know for whatever reason mary gets like a billion views on webtoon and like I post my shit and it gets like
03:12:32 it gets like
03:12:34 Eight eight views and maybe a comment if I'm if I'm really lucky. It's so like, yeah, I don't know
03:12:39 Which it doesn't feel I never get anything out of it. I feel like the webtoon
03:12:43 crowd
03:12:45 Similar and enough to the tapas crowd is just the sort of thing that mary withers comics
03:12:50 fit very nicely into there's a lot of anime stuff
03:12:54 There's a lot of emotional
03:12:56 I think I think he likes it because I think he likes it because it's easier to monetize than like posting on twitter
03:13:02 So I think like for him, it's like a moneymaker, but for me, it's not so
03:13:06 Yeah, yeah
03:13:09 Uh, that's how I feel about webtoon
03:13:12 Next and and tapas next one is called billionaire man
03:13:17 Uh, let's say vocaru link. So let me um
03:13:21 Get that
03:13:22 three two one go
03:13:25 billionaire man with briefcase walks down the street
03:13:31 He slips in a communist puddle
03:13:35 He drops briefcase all the money flitters out
03:13:40 He screams. Oh no
03:13:43 My billions
03:13:46 Reduced to millions
03:13:48 He tries to grab up the money. He screams
03:13:54 He is so busy. He does not see little girl walking down the street
03:14:01 She slips in a communist puddle and falls into the street
03:14:08 A communist car is on the beat
03:14:13 Save me billionaire man screams the girl, but he does not listen
03:14:19 I'm sorry. I cannot save you little girl. I am too busy saving money
03:14:37 It's so sad
03:14:48 Are you crying right now if only there was anything anyone could have done
03:14:59 It's just I get it though, you know, he worked really hard for that money
03:15:08 It's funny how like even with all of the voice stuff I can easily tell it's oblivion for
03:15:14 Yeah
03:15:15 I know his voice too much
03:15:18 Yeah, I'm pretty bad at identifying voices, but I could you know, I feel like I don't think there was
03:15:27 There's much attempt to hide it
03:15:29 But uh, I mean it was just gas. Oh oblivion fall you
03:15:34 I believe in fall you rascal check the next
03:15:37 Voice metal. I think it is a visual image of this this one we just listened to
03:15:44 Oh
03:15:45 All right, let's um
03:15:48 Let's see about that
03:15:51 No
03:15:54 There's that me
03:15:57 It's I'm the I'm the communist car. You're in the communist car. Oh my god
03:16:01 Ah
03:16:05 What are all these trucks? I they just
03:16:08 I I mean I could imagine that it's a a reference to the truck punchline
03:16:13 from germa and star videos
03:16:17 But I have no idea about that
03:16:19 It's it's a thing where germa and star would play gta 4 and they would make videos star star is a
03:16:26 A
03:16:27 Like a video person funny gamer youtuber. They used to make tf2 stuff now. They stream a lot
03:16:33 um, they do dnd stuff now, but like um
03:16:36 They had a truck punchline. He would spawn in
03:16:39 So many trucks that it would crash the game or it would make things run really slow
03:16:44 And the the the joke wasn't that the trucks were funny
03:16:48 It was that he would always ruin like a setup that germa was trying to do for a different joke
03:16:53 And then he would just like spawn in a bunch of trucks. It's like no not the fucking trunk the truck punchline again
03:17:00 You're always doing that. You're ruining this fucking video. No
03:17:05 And I'm not sure I'm not sure if that's what this is. I can't really tell
03:17:09 I mean what why else is there trucks coming down?
03:17:13 I think maybe it's just because like there was one crash and then there was just like crash after crash after crash
03:17:18 It's like a bunch more trucks just come smash from the sky. I guess communist trucks from the communist sky
03:17:25 I
03:17:25 You're a woke sky
03:17:28 Under your wokes these communist trucks are your woke sky. They're they're delivering pronouns
03:17:34 Nate seems to be having a good time tripping over all his money
03:17:39 No, my billions reduced to millions
03:17:43 Sad it's a lot of billions
03:17:46 That you're you're losing if it was reduced to millions
03:17:50 Yeah, it's almost that's almost all of it. Yeah, it's almost all of it
03:17:55 sad
03:17:56 Uh, unless you mean unless it was like reduced from
03:17:59 2 billion to like 900 million
03:18:04 It's possible. It's technically possible within the
03:18:08 definitions we've
03:18:10 Received next one is called should I from sorry it's long at pcp.drugs
03:18:16 Uh, let me just get that downloading. Okay, three two one go
03:18:23 Hello, Ben. Hello Gib. Hello as someone who has known your names and uh
03:18:31 Just heard your voice
03:18:33 and
03:18:35 Somewhat know you through the video
03:18:37 this internet
03:18:40 Internet presence that you have proved for yourself
03:18:44 Should I
03:18:45 root for you
03:18:48 to gmi in the internet space
03:18:51 Or should I root for your downfall so you get real industry jobs?
03:18:58 and
03:19:00 Make bigger money
03:19:02 in danger of your
03:19:04 potentially
03:19:06 From what that we from what I gather somewhat
03:19:10 unsustainable lifestyle
03:19:13 That probably all kind of applies. I actually just
03:19:17 Should I should I should I hope for your internet career to succeed or should I should I just
03:19:24 you know
03:19:27 Jill you
03:19:29 So the question is
03:19:30 Should he knows it?
03:19:32 Yeah, should he root for our
03:19:35 Downfall or for our internet career to succeed?
03:19:39 the downfall being like
03:19:41 Implying that if we lose our internet career
03:19:45 Then we'd be forced to get a real job which would give us more money
03:19:50 hypothetically
03:19:52 I mean, um
03:19:54 I'm not opposed to like a real job
03:19:56 But I wouldn't really want it to come on the heels of like well my internet career failed
03:20:01 So I guess I better go
03:20:04 Bark up a new tree
03:20:06 I would maybe want to be I would maybe hope to be like well my internet career is doing
03:20:11 Okay, but like there are other avenues. I can maybe be pursuing
03:20:15 at the same time
03:20:17 Including but not limited to
03:20:20 You know more traditional work
03:20:22 yeah, I
03:20:24 I feel like um
03:20:26 Personally
03:20:29 I don't really mind as long as I can sustain myself
03:20:33 Um like a bit like I don't need like a huge house
03:20:38 It'll be all right if I can get something like some some some building of my own, uh, but that's like
03:20:45 I don't know
03:20:47 I don't want to live
03:20:49 Like a really boring life that I hate with a job that sucks
03:20:54 I'd rather be like a like a minorly
03:20:57 Successful artist online if it means that I get enough money to do what I like doing
03:21:04 Generally speaking obviously it's good to have money. Yeah, and it's good to be able to afford things, but like I wouldn't
03:21:11 I mean it's the reason I stuck with art
03:21:14 so far is because
03:21:16 You know, it's not that good for making money. It actually sucks a lot
03:21:20 You have to be extremely lucky to be in the art field and be making it big
03:21:26 Making money
03:21:28 in the industry
03:21:29 It's not like I could guarantee that an industry job in the arts would be good for me
03:21:35 financially
03:21:36 Maybe just as bad and I'd be more upset
03:21:40 so I don't know
03:21:42 Please don't root for my downfall. I'd rather be
03:21:47 Having a encouragement
03:21:49 I'm assuming that this guy
03:21:52 I'm I'm
03:21:53 Maybe I'm assuming too much, but I assume that this guy
03:21:58 Likes us and he and he's wants the best outcome for us and he is asking what is a better outcome success as an internet creator or a
03:22:05 failure that leads to
03:22:07 more traditional
03:22:09 employment, uh
03:22:11 I mean
03:22:14 Yeah, I guess
03:22:15 I guess it's possible. It's it's conceivable that like someone attempts to
03:22:21 You know make a career online fails and then ends up finding more traditional employment in a in a field that is
03:22:28 You know, maybe ends up being better for them
03:22:32 Uh, that's possible. I mean, I guess I would say
03:22:37 viewer
03:22:39 That if you're hoping for the best outcome for us, I don't know like
03:22:44 What do I think is the best outcome for me?
03:22:47 I mean, I mean
03:22:48 I guess what do you think is the best outcome or if you I mean if you think that I would do better
03:22:54 to quit the internet
03:22:55 And and uh, you know get a job
03:22:58 Like if you think that would be a better outcome for me then you then I guess you should hope for that
03:23:02 If if what you want is the best outcome
03:23:05 But I mean, I don't necessarily think
03:23:08 That's the case
03:23:11 So, I mean
03:23:14 Yeah, you might disagree
03:23:16 Like I think the fact is that I know
03:23:21 With what I can do
03:23:24 And the opportunities I have
03:23:26 That I'm gonna be all right in the creative space. I'm not like
03:23:32 Like seconds away from starving to death
03:23:35 I I'm doing all right despite being so like small and insignificant
03:23:42 um
03:23:43 It it obviously isn't that but isn't that just the human condition though? Yeah, I yeah
03:23:49 Like with my skill set like I know that even if I lose
03:23:53 Uh
03:23:54 All of the subscribers and patreon people I can build something
03:23:59 up
03:24:00 And like do some good work. I know how to make good videos. I'm a good writer. I'm a good artist
03:24:06 I can make enough with what I have I would I will I may never make it big
03:24:12 Um, but I don't need to really
03:24:15 And so I feel comfortable. I guess
03:24:18 In the situation I'm in and I'm only gonna get better at the art that I do when I do more of it
03:24:25 So like I don't even know what a downfall would look like unless I don't enjoy doing these things anymore
03:24:34 Yeah, I mean I guess in this context a downfall is
03:24:38 Is
03:24:40 You suffer a precipitous decline in
03:24:45 A viewer's attention
03:24:48 Whatever patreon
03:24:50 revenue
03:24:52 Uh
03:24:54 Like if if all of my if all of my savings are gone and I have to make money immediately
03:25:00 And uh, all of my subscribers are gone. I have no like it's probably a bad idea
03:25:05 To do that. I would have to get a little job to build up like
03:25:10 A a being a live fund so that I could maybe get back into it
03:25:17 Mm-hmm, like my skills don't deteriorate that quickly as long as I'm still enjoying it. It'll be easy to keep going
03:25:27 Um, you know, I guess I think
03:25:30 I feel like you know, I have a skill set I have some things that I'm good at
03:25:35 I get nervous sometimes. I don't know because I don't feel like I can I don't feel like I have
03:25:41 Can confidently say like oh, yeah, I'll be okay. Like I could get a job
03:25:45 Wherever I don't know if that's true. Well, I don't know I could get a job
03:25:48 I'm saying I could make art and post it online and gain
03:25:53 followers again if I lose them all because I'm good at stuff
03:25:58 Honestly, I don't know. I think um, I think I've said this before
03:26:02 I think I might like to try at some point maybe in the not too distant future
03:26:07 to see if I can get some sort of like
03:26:10 work on like like more traditional work on some kind of
03:26:13 Some kind of team or studio or project or something
03:26:17 um
03:26:18 Just be part of like a creative team doing something. I think that would be pretty cool
03:26:24 I don't know what it would be
03:26:26 But I'm nervous and the thought makes me nervous because like what if I try to do that and it's just like
03:26:31 Well, you're just you're just a complete hack. Like you have no you have no skills. You have no skills. It could be
03:26:38 You you overestimate
03:26:40 What people in regular jobs have as skill levels
03:26:44 But I don't want a regular job. I want a creative job. Well, I mean even regular creative jobs like people
03:26:50 My brother knows this because he went to uni for game development with a lot of people
03:26:56 Who are like dumb as shit and the only thing they're good at is talking themselves into business opportunities
03:27:02 They don't know how to code even though they purport to do that
03:27:05 They don't know that that like they have no creative bone in the body
03:27:09 But they're like a creative director for some studio and something is like they just walk their way in they talk their way in
03:27:17 and they suck
03:27:19 You don't need unlike my brother
03:27:22 Charlie is like very very talented, but he didn't have that sort of social like
03:27:28 uh, yeah, I'm just gonna walk in like I own the place and so he's more
03:27:33 Stuck to like indie stuff rather than getting an industry job
03:27:36 which sucks because
03:27:38 people in the industry need him because he's really talented but like
03:27:44 Being in the into it being in the industry doesn't mean that you're like necessarily good at anything
03:27:51 So you would have no problem with the skill set you have getting a job at a creative like
03:27:57 Industry profession thing because I mean it's it's it's not as like that's true
03:28:03 It's not as like cutthroat everywhere as you may imagine
03:28:10 Yeah, well, I hope so. I don't know. Uh, I thought about it a lot. I still have no idea like
03:28:16 Uh, what I what uh, what that's actually gonna look like if I even try to try to do it. Uh,
03:28:23 Uh, I just want to be part of a team. I want to be part of a club. I want to be part of a little
03:28:29 A little a little a little a little crew
03:28:32 You know, I'm not like rule. Yeah a little motley crew doing a doing work on a thing and
03:28:39 making a thing
03:28:41 That's the that's the dream
03:28:44 Um, but um
03:28:48 Okay, I think we've answered that question thoroughly. Yes, uh, next one is called king cringis bingis
03:28:55 viewer discretion advice three two one go
03:28:59 What's a pcb? It's a me cringis bingis the third version
03:29:04 Uh, uh this week I I watched the inside job
03:29:10 I banged it actually it was real good
03:29:13 I hope it doesn't get canceled. Uh, and I crinked at uh, Ben's videos
03:29:20 Kind of me meager viewership. No, I hope it gets better
03:29:27 By cringis bingis
03:29:29 sailing out
03:29:31 I I mean
03:29:33 You sent this email yesterday. You sent this voicemail yesterday. I have like 18 by yesterday
03:29:37 I was hitting like I was hitting like 75 80k views
03:29:40 It's not bad. That's not meager. That's not meager
03:29:46 It's it's doing a lot better than I thought it would like I feel I I definitely underestimated the mega man
03:29:53 fan clamoring for something like this
03:29:56 I did not I was not counting on it to be like
03:30:00 An immediate hit an immediately thing that people in the mega man fandom were talking about that is
03:30:06 Something I hoped for but I didn't like expect
03:30:10 Uh, yeah, I I kind of expected that would like underperform compared to my previous videos because I didn't have
03:30:17 you know
03:30:19 uh
03:30:20 Because I didn't have like, you know dumb shits with a bunch of dumb shit followers
03:30:25 like Trixie to be like
03:30:26 Duh, this thing is good and a bunch of morons go like I guess it's genius. It's genius
03:30:33 Uh, I didn't have that. So, you know, I knew it was going to be a huge failure. Um, wrong. It's fine actually
03:30:40 Yeah, it's outperforming. I this is I mean, it's good. It's getting like it's
03:30:44 I mean, I don't know if this is going to continue, but it's getting about like 20k views a day
03:30:49 So does a view count if I come back to it like a day later to continue watching does that count as a second view?
03:30:55 I I don't
03:30:58 Think so. I'm actually not sure
03:31:01 I'm actually not sure about that because I know that you can watch a video multiple times and it counts as multiple views
03:31:09 But no, who does it?
03:31:11 Yeah, like but if you like but if you like it it saves your place and then you pick it back up
03:31:15 Does it count as multiple? I I'm not sure
03:31:17 Because I'm sure about that either like if I can it was a gangnam style
03:31:21 Just gets replayed and replayed and it became like the first billion view video
03:31:26 Right
03:31:27 it's not like
03:31:29 One billion people clicked on that link people have seen it. Yeah, even though I'm pretty sure billion people did hear it
03:31:35 But from like radio, but not personally they didn't personally go to youtube to listen to it. They just know about it
03:31:42 right um
03:31:45 Yeah, I don't I don't know
03:31:47 um, but I mean
03:31:51 Yeah, I told myself
03:31:53 When I launched it I was like as long as as long as it doesn't get less than if it gets less than 100k
03:31:59 Then I'll be embarrassed. I'll consider it a failure
03:32:02 Uh, but it's like ever and now you're not allowed to be embarrassed about it
03:32:07 No, I feel okay. I mean, I mean, I'm embarrassed about embarrassed that I didn't draw the line
03:32:11 I'm embarrassed that everyone keeps saying oh, he's doing the tim rogers thing
03:32:14 Oh, oh, he's acting like tim rogers like no, I'm not not really
03:32:18 Just because I did that gay little thing with my voice a couple of times doesn't mean that I'm tim roger
03:32:24 um
03:32:27 What else am I embarrassed what else am I embarrassed about um, I'm embarrassed about how my hair looks at many points
03:32:34 But that's that's fine
03:32:37 Oh, yeah, I forgot you shaved. I keep seeing the video of you talking about mega man. I'm like that's ben currently
03:32:43 But no no not anymore
03:32:46 That ben is dead that ben died before he even
03:32:51 Before he even got a chance
03:32:53 That get that that ben died before he even lived
03:32:56 That ben is like that ben is like the light of a distant star who's you know light from
03:33:01 From from millennia ago is only now
03:33:04 You know reaching the earth to be seen in our telescopes. It's it's exactly like that
03:33:10 um
03:33:12 But anyway the video is doing yeah, it is
03:33:16 When it when it started
03:33:18 It was doing better it it was doing not as well as the chris chan 102 because chris chan 102
03:33:25 Came out like right when chris chan was like making the news because like oh god the shit's gone down
03:33:31 Yeah, fucking sexual assault incest charges. She's going to jail like this is the most fucked up thing
03:33:36 Uh, so that was big so chris chan 102 got a big a big bump right at the start and then uh
03:33:44 Uh
03:33:45 Kokoro wish had a pretty slow start
03:33:47 But actually kokoro wish has actually had more sustained viewership and actually kokoro wish has more viewers now than
03:33:54 chris chan 102 did
03:33:56 Which is nice because I think that's a better light. It's my favorite lecture is the kokoro wish one
03:34:00 um
03:34:01 and then
03:34:03 Yeah, this one was performing a little bit better than kokoro wish did on launch but worse than the um
03:34:09 uh
03:34:11 chris chan and I was like, okay, that's a good sign. It's definitely gonna it's definitely gonna hit 100k
03:34:16 It's not gonna be a problem. You know, maybe in a month or two it'll hit 100k
03:34:20 And then it started to pick up around like day three and now it's a it's at almost 110
03:34:27 Because it just keeps it's getting like a thousand views an hour or something for the last couple days
03:34:33 So I think it might be starting to
03:34:36 Not like go down, but like it's not increasing as fast. So
03:34:41 I think it might be starting to peak
03:34:43 in terms of momentum
03:34:45 But we'll see
03:34:46 Anyway, I'm very happy with it. It's it's definitely outperformed my expectations
03:34:50 um
03:34:52 I've gotten a few new patrons not like a huge deluge of them, but I mean I'm hoping that a lot more people will see it
03:34:57 And maybe some more will pledge so that's nice
03:35:00 If I can get if I can get the if I can get my goal of getting 100 patrons
03:35:06 that will be
03:35:07 I will not be quite at the pledge amount that I was back in like 2017 when my patreon was as highest
03:35:13 But it'll be like close that'll probably bring me to like 400 dollars a month, which is like close to what I was when I was
03:35:20 When I was uh peaking so that's my goal for the moment
03:35:29 Uh, yeah, okay next voicemail, uh
03:35:33 It's from prince isolation and it looks like it's two images
03:35:40 Is a voodoo in the voicemail as well. Oh, yeah, you're right. Let's listen to that. Okay, three two one go
03:35:47 How I predict finis comic will end
03:35:51 It's so emotional guys. I swear to god
03:35:55 It's so fucking
03:35:57 Oh the culmination of things
03:36:03 So it's the images is a view and me
03:36:06 and Vinnie's comic
03:36:08 culmination of things
03:36:10 culmination of things. Oh my god. I never wanted it to end like this Ben. I'm crying. I got my guitar
03:36:17 Oh, that's a princess princess such a good uh
03:36:21 artist
03:36:22 Yeah, a big old red man
03:36:25 Given the amazing red man stand if you need a music reference just call him big iron
03:36:32 Are the these are just single images, right? These aren't full albums. Yeah. Yeah, just a single. Okay, and it's you
03:36:41 What's what's been going on like this
03:36:44 You know, I never I never fat. Uh, hey, I'm sure you didn't
03:36:51 So cool, why why am I crying about this and you're the one getting beaten up? Am I killing you? Why am I killing you?
03:36:58 I think we're fighting each other
03:36:59 I think the implication is that we have to fight each other. Oh, no
03:37:03 I got my
03:37:05 You knocked my tooth out and not your tooth out. Just like aqueous
03:37:09 What the fuck? Why would you do that gib?
03:37:12 Well, I mean, what how could you do it?
03:37:15 I how could you do this to me? Why would you just hit you with my guitar really hard? That's how I could do it
03:37:21 Yeah, you know, actually that makes a lot of sense
03:37:26 That is how it would happen, isn't it?
03:37:29 Um
03:37:31 Uh, what was I was I saying?
03:37:34 Oh, I was saying I never found I tried to find the enemy sprites from clash of demon head because there were the little like red
03:37:41 Like red man faces walking around and I couldn't find them
03:37:45 No, I couldn't find no, I could not find enemy sprites from that game. I googled around looking at like sprite
03:37:52 Sheets and I didn't they might be out there somewhere
03:37:55 But I wasn't able to find them eat very easily and I eventually I eventually gave up
03:37:59 I don't know
03:38:02 I guess it's just a funny game
03:38:04 It's just a funny little red little like little like smiley face little red oval man on little feet
03:38:10 It's like a little baby red man
03:38:12 Like he like butted off and do a little head that walks around
03:38:16 um
03:38:17 Oh the next one the next two I think are the same images
03:38:21 But it's like yeah at justincasehotmail.com. Oh, maybe he thought that they would get cut off. Yeah. Yeah
03:38:28 We saw and then the next next one is called btw's and it's also from prince isolation. Okay, three two one go
03:38:36 By the way, I just want to say I really do appreciate venice comics. I'm having so they're cool

03:41:19 So it's not like he he fished up the scroll got the Kawasaki scroll
03:41:25 Those those like black those leather boots do not suit him at all. No
03:41:30 No, no, but they they do suit like the photo realistic fish

03:41:38 Oh, well, haven't you seen the screenshots from sonic frontiers of him fishing up like photo realistic fish?
03:41:44 No, I yeah, that's just he fishes up fish that look like way too realistic

03:44:50 I'd have avoid
03:44:53 Yeah, I think he's saying I have avoided I had avoided kissing her to kill her and I mean that's true
03:44:59 I'm very I'm very sad that she's died in me. Oh my god. What's happening now? Uh, and then
03:45:06 drops to knee
03:45:08 What mega man charging sound effect?
03:45:13 Am I doing a mega man charge slap on the ring? Do a mega man charge slap on the butt
03:45:20 Over over my knee is like like I'm I'm spanking here
03:45:25 That's like here to punish her for having brisket die immediately. I mean, this is true. This is what I would do
03:45:32 In response a reverberated slap and anime girl. Wow sound. You know the one
03:45:39 Falia defeated
03:45:42 So that your hand in the slap position. Oh, hey, yeah
03:45:45 So oblivion fall does this thing where he sends women at me to mess with me and this was just that again
03:45:52 Briska. Yeah, sorry Gib. Uh, maybe he'll send another one
03:46:00 The cinematic the PCP cinematic universe the the Vinnie the Vinnie PCP verse. I don't know how you would say it
03:46:09 It's just such an absurd concept of oblivion for sending women to mess with Ben St
03:46:16 And it happens often
03:46:21 Wait, wait, it's two. Oh my god. It's two already. It's time for me to take it's time for me to drink my coffee
03:46:27 It's time for me to drink more coffee. I'm I'm losing it
03:46:32 My mind
03:46:35 Okay, this is another page
03:46:39 Ben right
03:46:41 Yeah, if I see oblivion fall or another girl he sends I won't hold back on it
03:46:47 You held back. Jeez. All right
03:46:50 Let's go
03:46:51 Is he holding back? He's immediately just
03:46:57 Okay, so we're walking into the darkness. Look at you. You just look like pinkie pie
03:47:03 I do
03:47:06 I like the strides some good strides here
03:47:11 Enter the darkness of ben sains dwelling here
03:47:14 And here we are Casa de la Ben St. Yeah, that's what I call it
03:47:20 Your home is made of cardboard boxes
03:47:23 Yeah, uh, my landlord is a cheap ass instead of just ordering siding
03:47:27 She bought a handful of things on amazon just to keep the boxes and packaging for what you see here
03:47:32 She saved money this way
03:47:34 bizarre
03:47:36 Oh, no that
03:47:38 Upsets me because it reminds me that I got texted by my land x landlord yesterday
03:47:41 And she wants me to pay a bunch of fees that don't make any sense
03:47:46 I gotta fight her about it
03:47:47 But I'll worry about you to fight. She wants you to to to pay fees fees
03:47:52 She wants my fee fee. She wants me to pay two hundred and fifty dollars for damages that I didn't do
03:47:57 She wants me to pay a cleaning bill which seems like bullshit to me. That's that one's like debatable
03:48:04 and then uh, she wants me to pay five hundred dollars in late fees
03:48:09 for paying rent late which like
03:48:12 a late fee is not
03:48:14 Like an egregious thing like technically she's allowed to charge a late fee, but you can't charge that's like that's like half
03:48:19 That's like most of my rent and that's how that's that's outlandish
03:48:23 Um, so I don't know. Anyway, I have to fucking argue with her about that later
03:48:28 Now I'm now now i'm dreading looking at my phone because I know i'm gonna have a text back from her
03:48:32 Dang because I sent her messages telling her to
03:48:35 Fuck off with that shit and she's probably gonna send me a bunch of crap, but I'm not gonna think I'm not gonna think about it
03:48:41 I'm not
03:48:42 Going to think about it
03:48:45 um
03:48:47 Anyway, think about the comic instead. Yes last page
03:48:52 Hey there, this is my last stop of the day
03:48:55 I was waiting here for somebody to sign for this package
03:49:00 Oh wait first I said oh my fucking god. I'm a resident. Oh say us ups driver
03:49:06 Yeah
03:49:07 Great the package is for a bowling ball saint
03:49:11 It's been saint, but yeah, okay sign here on the electronic pad. Oh fucking k
03:49:18 It wasn't as cohesive as I'd like but the idea comes through well enough
03:49:21 I hope a delivery truck is waiting in the darkness and gives Ben yet another thing to deal with
03:49:25 I'm so sad to receive this bowling ball
03:49:28 What is this bowling ball for it's a just such a burden
03:49:34 Yeah, I'm sort of like looking sheepishly over your shoulder
03:49:37 uh
03:49:39 It's just like this is just like um
03:49:43 Just like in albuquerque
03:49:45 when
03:49:46 Weird owl was in that plane crash and then he had to drag along his big leather suitcase in his garment bag
03:49:52 in his 12 pound bowling ball
03:49:55 And his lucky lucky autographed glow in the dark snorkel and I think I might have missed a thing on that list
03:50:00 But you get the idea
03:50:01 the bowling ball
03:50:03 um
03:50:05 Damn what will happen next tune in next time this is next time. This is really
03:50:11 Involved. This is really like like a big project. It's really involved. It's a big project and I it's just uh, it's remarkable
03:50:19 I'd like how much it's grown. It's remarkable and it's commendable that there's more of these every single week. It's uh, it's crazy
03:50:27 Like the the scratchy is sort of like darkness around your house is so cool
03:50:31 Vinny, I think you should get
03:50:34 I think you should invest in like a drawing tablet of some kind
03:50:37 And I think you should try drawing digitally because I used to scribble stuff on like a notepad
03:50:42 And you know
03:50:45 It sucked
03:50:46 uh
03:50:47 And I improved my my my pieces improved a lot when I just had a freaking
03:50:53 canvas in manga studio or whatever
03:50:56 To draw on and I had layers to work with
03:50:58 Uh, I think you should do that. I think you would not regret it
03:51:04 Uh, yeah, the the fucking the slap and then me just
03:51:09 Sombrily with my hand in the position. It's just really funny. It's for some reason
03:51:14 In the next panel like so serious
03:51:17 Yeah, yeah the head down
