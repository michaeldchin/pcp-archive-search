00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:09 the best guy ever. Oh, who's in the Rapscallion crew today? Nope, it's Gibbontake. What's
00:00:17 up?
00:00:18 It's me, the host of the show. I'm the main attraction. The guy who can fire you all with
00:00:25 a moment's hand wave. His managerial powers are unparalleled. We've got Ben Saint. Who?
00:00:34 Don't ask me. I'm sorry, what? I thought we killed him. Tom Oliver, welcome. Welcome
00:00:42 again. Did you know that I have a long running podcast series on my Patreon? 23 episodes so
00:00:47 far and more, new one every week, new I am Games video coming out in three days, probably
00:00:52 out by the time you hear this. Go give me money and watch. My spine is back. My will
00:00:57 is back. Everything is back. Back puns. Get it? I'm back. Let's do it.
00:01:01 Tom Oliver pulled off an epic Zandatsu, stealing and crushing those electrolytes from his enemies,
00:01:06 and now he's stronger than ever.
00:01:07 Yes, it was fucking great. That's what I have to do tomorrow. I'm going in for a post-op
00:01:11 tomorrow and I have to crush my surgeon's spine and get the electrolytes to finish
00:01:14 the...
00:01:15 You can only graduate if you show that your spine is stronger than his.
00:01:19 Yes.
00:01:20 Well, so we got a mage, of course. A mage is here. Hello.
00:01:23 Hey, hello, Pokemon. Am I right, guys? I want to talk about it.
00:01:27 T-minus five days. When you hear this, it will be out, I think.
00:01:30 Exactly, exactly. Yeah, that's why I want you to bring it up.
00:01:33 Let me just stop for one second and say that I was so mad yesterday on Twitter. I saw that
00:01:37 the trending hashtag was like, thank you, hashtag thank you, Game Freak. And I just
00:01:43 thought that was so vile, so utterly loathsome.
00:01:48 I don't care. They're a fucking business. They do not deserve your love. If you like
00:01:53 their products, cool.
00:01:54 Oh, okay.
00:01:55 Oh, let's celebrate. Let's celebrate how much money they extracted from us.
00:02:00 There was the inevitable backlash, because everyone was mad at Game Freak for fucking
00:02:04 up the National Dex, but now that that dust has settled on that, people are now swinging
00:02:07 in the other direction.
00:02:08 Oh, yeah. Oh, maybe they fucked it up and ruined everything, but oh, but they're giving
00:02:11 us a new game, though. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you, master.
00:02:15 Can I have another, please?
00:02:17 Look, I'm in, look, Ben, they cut, they cut scissor, all right? They fucking cut scissor
00:02:22 for the fucking game.
00:02:23 Thank you for only belting me across the face 23 times instead of the traditional 24, sir.
00:02:30 Everybody, let's clap, consume product and then consume next product.
00:02:33 Yay.
00:02:34 Okay, but Mega Gigantamax Gengar is really funny looking at you like that. He's really
00:02:42 funny. And Google it, you know, let's find an image. He's, he's, he's like doing that
00:02:46 thing where he's like, he's like in the ground, like Mega Gengar, but like only the top half
00:02:51 of his mouth is like open like a big cave in front of you. Can you, can you like that?
00:02:55 Fuck?
00:02:56 Ben, it's sick. It's totally dope.
00:02:58 No.
00:02:59 I'm just ignoring all of that. I'm just like Corviknight.
00:03:01 Please look at this Gengar.
00:03:03 I'm sticking to my guns. Still, still Corviknight is badass and is one of my favorite people
00:03:08 in the world.
00:03:09 I don't even remember who Corviknight is.
00:03:11 Corviknight is the, the fucking Demo Dark Goth bird.
00:03:15 It's, it's the Goth, it's the Victorian Dark Souls bird.
00:03:19 Yeah.
00:03:20 Isn't it, isn't it weird when they present like Corviknight was like first introduced
00:03:24 and you know, we all thought pretty cool, but that's like the third evolution of the
00:03:28 line and it feels weird to me that they introduced the like third evolution before we ever saw
00:03:33 the first or second.
00:03:34 Because they know that the third evolution is the only good one in the line.
00:03:38 I think it's probably because they like doesn't like Corviknight like do something in the
00:03:42 lore of this world.
00:03:43 It's used as like a transport bird all over the place.
00:03:46 That is true.
00:03:47 It's a taxi bird.
00:03:48 Um, okay.
00:03:49 So, so Gigantamaxing and Dynamaxing are like different things, right?
00:03:54 Cause I, cause I see, cause I see a Gengar and I'm assuming this is a Dynamax?
00:04:01 No, wait, wait. Dynamaxing is making the Pokemon big. Gigantamaxing is when they have a specific
00:04:06 form. Cause I see a giant Dynamax Gengar, but he doesn't look any different from normal.
00:04:12 So I'm not seeing what you're talking about.
00:04:14 Yeah.
00:04:15 Certain Pokemon can Gigantamax, which is when they get a different form.
00:04:18 Dude, I'm, I'm searching for this right now and I actually cannot find the image I was
00:04:22 looking at yesterday.
00:04:23 Yeah.
00:04:24 That's just big Gengar, but that's not what I was looking at.
00:04:25 There was one with Gengar's mouth.
00:04:26 Was it a fan at it?
00:04:28 Was this not real?
00:04:29 No.
00:04:30 You've been duped.
00:04:31 It was 3D models.
00:04:32 Oh, I mean, okay.
00:04:33 That's really cool, but that's not, that's not what that looks funny as well.
00:04:36 I'll get back to you.
00:04:37 I love that.
00:04:38 Gengar is a hilarious great boy and I'm way into him, but you know, whatever, I'll get
00:04:43 back to you.
00:04:44 I'm just getting my fucking Tyranitar if he's in this game.
00:04:45 I haven't checked.
00:04:46 He's going to get fucking Tyranitar back.
00:04:47 He is in the game.
00:04:48 Tyranitar is in the game.
00:04:49 And that's the only reason I'm buying this game.
00:04:52 Oh, that's going to be good.
00:04:53 There was, there was a thing I was, I was thinking the other day, like, you know, some of these
00:04:58 new Pokemon look pretty good.
00:04:59 Corviknight, you know, nice, nice looking design.
00:05:03 It's such a shame that it's in a Pokemon game, you know, like that was my first thought.
00:05:07 Like, what a shame that all these like nice designs are in a game that sucks.
00:05:12 And I don't like-
00:05:13 Damn.
00:05:14 Give with the harsh fruits.
00:05:15 And I'm not saying that, I'm not saying that because like, I'm a, I'm a bandwagon Pokemon
00:05:18 sucks because of this or that.
00:05:19 I just haven't liked Pokemon since Emerald.
00:05:23 So you know.
00:05:24 I, I was very critical of Sun and Moon as well, because Sun and Moon had tons of stuff
00:05:27 to infuriate me.
00:05:29 Sun and Moon was a nice little thing, but that was like the first time I'd played Pokemon
00:05:35 for like 10 years or something.
00:05:37 I got a set.
00:05:38 I have not seen this before.
00:05:40 Surfetched is fucking awesome.
00:05:43 It's the evolution of Farfetched.
00:05:46 It's so good.
00:05:47 Oh, with the really long fucking leak.
00:05:48 Yeah.
00:05:49 I mean, yeah.
00:05:50 Farfetched finally got an evolution.
00:05:51 Super.
00:05:52 I can't wait, I can't wait for him to come out in Pokemon Go, so I can just look at him.
00:05:57 It's always good for.
00:05:59 Yeah.
00:06:00 Yeah.
00:06:01 It's going to be in Pokemon Sword Farfetched, I think.
00:06:03 I'm getting Sword.
00:06:04 So let, let's just go down the line.
00:06:06 Let's self-segregate as we like to do.
00:06:08 Shield, pony.
00:06:09 Sword boy, sword over here.
00:06:10 Shield.
00:06:11 Mage.
00:06:12 Pony, pony, pony.
00:06:13 I'm getting it.
00:06:14 Fuck it.
00:06:15 I'm getting Sword, but, but someone's getting it for me as a gift.
00:06:18 I would not be buying it otherwise.
00:06:19 I still haven't got to have found a reason to get a switch.
00:06:22 Okay, fair enough.
00:06:23 Fair enough.
00:06:24 But all the ports give.
00:06:25 Don't you want to pay for game again?
00:06:27 Nope.
00:06:28 I know I do.
00:06:29 Poltergeist is pretty, pretty cute, I guess.
00:06:31 It is.
00:06:32 I like it.
00:06:33 I like it.
00:06:34 And it has a pre-evolution that's a little teacup.
00:06:36 Does it?
00:06:37 Yeah, that one's cute.
00:06:38 I don't see that.
00:06:39 Poltergeist.
00:06:40 Yeah, it's, it's a T.
00:06:41 It wasn't the leaks.
00:06:43 Oh, sorry.
00:06:44 I like MLP ponytail a lot.
00:06:46 That's in shield.
00:06:47 I mean, that's, you know, that's cute.
00:06:48 I like it.
00:06:49 What can I say?
00:06:50 Which version has sandile?
00:06:51 A sandile even in this game?
00:06:52 Am I going to get mad now?
00:06:53 Who knows?
00:06:54 I'm not sure.
00:06:55 Disgusting.
00:06:56 They cut scissor.
00:06:57 They cut scissor.
00:06:58 And they cut fucking all my favorite Pokemon.
00:07:00 Scissor is the one who usually does the cutting.
00:07:02 Cause he slice and cut with the HM.
00:07:06 I was like, I was thinking to myself, guys, scissor, incredibly popular Pokemon.
00:07:10 Like one of the most iconic bug, but he's one of the only reasons why anyone likes
00:07:14 bug at all, right?
00:07:15 There's no fucking way they're cutting scissor, right?
00:07:18 No, it can't be.
00:07:19 There's no, and then I see the big black, red fucking X on his face.
00:07:23 You know what?
00:07:24 It's really a shame.
00:07:25 Can't believe it.
00:07:26 That the Pokemon company didn't have the balls to do the really hardcore move and cut Pikachu.
00:07:30 Let's just fucking move on.
00:07:31 We've had a lot of fucking Pikachu's.
00:07:33 It's time to move on.
00:07:34 Can you imagine if they just cut Pikachu?
00:07:37 They just was not there.
00:07:39 There was a, this idea doesn't make sense in practice, but I did see some fan art of
00:07:43 Mimikyu, right?
00:07:44 A Gigantamax to Mimikyu.
00:07:46 It sure would be funny if, when a Gigantamax is, it's now wearing a costume of Raichu.
00:07:52 Instead of its costume of Pikachu, but nobody cares about Raichu at all.
00:07:58 People only like Pikachu is that doesn't actually make sense.
00:08:01 Even though Raichu is objectively better.
00:08:03 I have a feeling that Pikachu has like almost all the shares in the company and he's like
00:08:08 calling all the shots.
00:08:09 Oh shit.
00:08:10 He's the Mickey Mouse basically of the Pokemon company.
00:08:13 Yeah.
00:08:14 That's fair.
00:08:15 Yep.
00:08:16 Yep.
00:08:17 I will get it and I will have at least a kind of decent time as I even do with the worst
00:08:22 Pokemon games.
00:08:24 I'm sure.
00:08:25 Why?
00:08:26 Because I, look, they're making a product and I do want to be part of the conversation
00:08:33 of the discussion of the game.
00:08:34 What's that worth?
00:08:35 And I just enjoy Pokemon.
00:08:36 If you notice that discussion worth when most of it is people going, ugh.
00:08:41 Because frankly, I think you guys are slightly exaggerating how bad this game looks.
00:08:45 Oh no, it's fine.
00:08:46 It's just, it's just like the same old shit and therefore it's like.
00:08:51 Yeah, I agree.
00:08:52 Yeah.
00:08:53 You know, Pokemon, whatever.
00:08:54 They're still going to have A&M's, right?
00:08:55 I like Pokemon and to be honest, I ain't too bothered.
00:08:58 Fuck it.
00:08:59 I don't know.
00:09:00 No, I don't think so.
00:09:01 Have they removed A&M's from this game?
00:09:02 There's no way they did.
00:09:03 I can't remember what their...
00:09:04 They removed them from Sun and Moon.
00:09:05 I don't think they would...
00:09:06 They weren't in the last game though.
00:09:07 They were removed.
00:09:08 Yeah, I'm sure they'll fuck it up.
00:09:10 I'm sure they'll only do bad things.
00:09:13 Yeah.
00:09:14 Well, if they have the taxi Pokemon and the Corvik Knight, then there's no reason to have
00:09:18 flies, so I'm guessing, you know, they're going to remove them.
00:09:21 Well, they got the whole thing with like open world, you can sit and have a curry or whatever
00:09:26 and camp out in the wilderness.
00:09:27 Traditional English dish curry.
00:09:28 So like fast travel might not be a thing.
00:09:31 But they might have trains.
00:09:32 Have you guys seen this?
00:09:33 I found this.
00:09:34 It looks kind of legit, but it's really bad.
00:09:36 It's really low res of like all the new Pokemon or something.
00:09:40 Oh yeah, that's based on the leaks.
00:09:42 Yeah, I think that's all the ones, at least at this time.
00:09:46 Oh, Karkol.
00:09:47 Karkol is the best one.
00:09:49 What's that?
00:09:50 I hate his eyes.
00:09:51 He is the middle evolution of the rock faggot thing.
00:09:55 The small one looks like another one.
00:09:57 The big one looks like Raihorn or whatever.
00:09:59 But the middle one is like a golem head, like decapitated and put it on a bed of coals
00:10:06 on like a stone slab and he's got tiny little leg things.
00:10:10 And he's got a really stupid expression.
00:10:12 He's pretty good.
00:10:14 I love how stupid he is.
00:10:15 The edges of his eyes are protruding.
00:10:17 I don't like it.
00:10:18 I think I really like...
00:10:19 Have you seen the fucking apple?
00:10:21 Are you seeing this fucking apple on the left?
00:10:24 It's a fucking apple.
00:10:26 All right.
00:10:27 I really like the snow version of Darmanitan with its big orb head.
00:10:34 It's good.
00:10:36 Although I am keen on having Pokémon in my life again, one thing I want to complain
00:10:43 though is the Pokémon designs.
00:10:45 I don't want to say they're ugly necessarily, but they don't give me like most of them,
00:10:50 most of the new ones, don't give me that Pokémon vibe anymore.
00:10:53 They kind of look weird.
00:10:54 I mean, look at fucking impendip and his two weird evolutions.
00:10:58 What is that thing?
00:11:00 Morkrim is like a sex demon, I'm pretty sure.
00:11:04 Did he find a revolution of impendip?
00:11:08 I mean, I think it's that weird purple one.
00:11:10 Oh yeah, the middle one.
00:11:12 I don't like the green.
00:11:13 Why did he add green?
00:11:14 Otherwise, I would like it otherwise, but that green is just...
00:11:17 Just green screen it away.
00:11:19 Key it out.
00:11:20 It's okay guys.
00:11:21 We've got all the original Kanto Pokémon in, so you can just use those exclusively
00:11:25 like you do every game.
00:11:26 The only ones that anyone cares about.
00:11:30 I know.
00:11:31 Hey, I just want to rent.
00:11:33 I just want to rent for one second.
00:11:35 I hate Goldeen.
00:11:36 I can't believe they put Goldeen in again.
00:11:39 It is.
00:11:40 It is.
00:11:41 Probably to fucking kill my Pokémon with Horn Drill again.
00:11:44 The new evolution of Corsola.
00:11:45 The new evolution of Corsola just is the white lady from Hollow Knight.
00:11:49 Yeah, and it's dope.
00:11:51 It's dope.
00:11:52 It's like it turns into Sea King, which is uglier, and it's a generic boring fish
00:11:58 in every single game, but Magikarp also is one of those.
00:12:02 It turns into a cool thing.
00:12:03 Goldeen is the worst Pokémon in Pokémon.
00:12:05 That's great.
00:12:06 That's good lore.
00:12:07 It's definitely up there.
00:12:08 No, it gets a horn.
00:12:11 It's not just a fish.
00:12:12 It had a horn.
00:12:13 No, man.
00:12:14 The horn is consistent between evolutions.
00:12:15 It's got a horn.
00:12:16 Yeah, yeah.
00:12:17 It gets a horn.
00:12:18 That's what I'm saying.
00:12:19 I'm saying it's got a horn though.
00:12:20 It's not just a fish.
00:12:21 It's got a horn.
00:12:22 We know you are hung up about horns, Ben, but other people don't have that tism.
00:12:25 Look, I got a horn, but you don't see me waving it around everywhere.
00:12:29 I'm tugging on my horn right now.
00:12:31 I really don't like Santa Conda.
00:12:33 It's fucking...
00:12:34 I really don't like Santa Claus.
00:12:36 This fucking image is small.
00:12:38 Silly snake.
00:12:39 Don't like it.
00:12:40 Okay, I mean, I've just got...
00:12:41 Have you guys noticed the fucking B-52, like the semi-legendary dragon, ghost type of this,
00:12:47 that launches fucking dragons out of its missile launchers on its fucking stealth jethead?
00:12:52 No, no, no.
00:12:53 It's a dragon puts, dragon quits, whatever it is, in the middle there.
00:12:57 I don't like it.
00:12:59 I mean, I think it's fucked up, but I'm way into it.
00:13:01 Yeah, I like it.
00:13:02 I don't know.
00:13:03 I like that one.
00:13:04 I don't like the literal penguin was just an ice cube on its head.
00:13:07 It's just an ice cube head.
00:13:08 Yeah, that one's actually really bad.
00:13:09 Man, have you seen it?
00:13:10 I thought that was like...
00:13:11 It's all just formed directly below it with the melted head.
00:13:13 Oh, my God.
00:13:14 I'll defend fucking vanillax, and I'll defend clefty, but I think I have to draw the line
00:13:19 at ice cube?
00:13:21 Ice cube.
00:13:22 Ice cube.
00:13:23 It's very bad.
00:13:24 It's an ice cube with a penguin for a body.
00:13:27 I mean, aside from obvious habitat things, what is the significance of like a fucking
00:13:35 mascot looking ice cube?
00:13:36 That's like what a fucking elementary school I would come up with.
00:13:39 It really is.
00:13:40 Unironically.
00:13:41 Unironically.
00:13:42 I don't like it.
00:13:43 I do like it.
00:13:44 It's so that purple thing.
00:13:46 Oh, it's all shit, boys.
00:13:48 We're going to hell in a handbasket.
00:13:49 I guess I'll just say spoilers or whatever, but have you seen the big mega-ultra-legendary
00:13:55 attorneys or whatever?
00:13:56 I mean, that thing's pretty sick.
00:13:57 It has a fucking city on its head.
00:13:59 It looks like a fucking...
00:14:00 What do they call it, an Eldrazi for Magic the Gathering?
00:14:03 The Cthulhu fucking demons?
00:14:05 Those are pretty sick.
00:14:06 It's got like two different forms, and it's other...
00:14:08 I want to know the lore behind that thing.
00:14:10 What the fuck is it?
00:14:11 I mean, it looks like an Ultra Beast.
00:14:12 You said Eldrazi, and now I just want to play Magic, because it's cooler than this.
00:14:14 It just looks like an Ultra Beast, basically.
00:14:16 It looks like...
00:14:17 It does.
00:14:18 100% true.
00:14:19 100% true.
00:14:20 I don't know.
00:14:22 There's like some deep King Arthur lore about like interdimensional Cthulhu demons or something
00:14:26 that I'm not aware of.
00:14:27 I guess we'll find out soon.
00:14:28 Maybe there's no.
00:14:29 Find out in five days, or after you're listening to this, because it's already out, you can
00:14:35 tell us how we were totally wrong about all these things in the comments.
00:14:38 I can't wait.
00:14:39 I mean, you know, I'm just thinking back.
00:14:41 Now is the appropriate time.
00:14:42 I'm thinking back to my experience of playing Sun and Moon.
00:14:45 Core gameplay loop.
00:14:46 You know.
00:14:47 Good.
00:14:48 Fine.
00:14:49 I hated the reduced number of gyms to four, effectively.
00:14:53 There was those trainers that each one around the world was the one elemental boy, but those
00:14:59 weren't real gyms.
00:15:00 Wait, and Sun and Moon?
00:15:01 Yeah.
00:15:02 Remember, they were only like...
00:15:03 No, they had the Kovunas.
00:15:04 The Trials.
00:15:05 The Trials.
00:15:06 Yeah, they had the Kovunas with the big boss, and the Babunas, the small ones.
00:15:10 But they also had the guys who would give you the Z-Crystal, the different elemental guys
00:15:15 who were sort of like gym leaders, kinda.
00:15:18 Okay, that all sucked.
00:15:19 I don't want any of that.
00:15:20 I just want gyms.
00:15:21 Gyms are classic.
00:15:22 They're good.
00:15:23 Well, there's definitely gyms in this one.
00:15:24 We know that.
00:15:25 Thank God for that.
00:15:26 Thank God for that.
00:15:27 You have the perfect formula.
00:15:29 I would buy just like a new Pokemon game of the exact same formula as like Heart, Gold,
00:15:35 and Soul Silver, basically till the end of time.
00:15:37 If you just give me new thing of the same style, because it's a fucking winner, and I
00:15:42 love that game.
00:15:43 I'm really...
00:15:44 Just the way I buy every Metroidvania I can find, and I play them, because I just love
00:15:47 the game.
00:15:48 I'm really curious as to how this curse can end.
00:15:53 People...
00:15:54 There have been alternative games that have come up and tried to be Pokemon that do the
00:16:00 things that the fans are looking for, or whatever, better gameplay and not shit and good and
00:16:07 stuff.
00:16:08 Pokemon's a monopoly.
00:16:09 We need to break it up.
00:16:10 Because it is not the designs that people have grown up with, and grown old with at this
00:16:16 point.
00:16:17 They just never get off the ground.
00:16:20 They never grab people's hearts and attentions.
00:16:22 It's like, how are we going to stop giving the Pokemon company money?
00:16:26 Gabe, I've got it.
00:16:27 I've got the solution.
00:16:28 The designs are kind of bad, though.
00:16:31 Have you guys seen fucking Mr. Mines Evolution?
00:16:33 Mr. Rhyme?
00:16:34 What the fuck is Mr. Rhyme?
00:16:36 Buster.
00:16:37 Okay, but I have the solution.
00:16:38 I have the solution to this, and here's what it is.
00:16:41 It's that we pull a Teddy Roosevelt, and we bust this fucking trust, and what that means
00:16:45 is...
00:16:46 In the old days, there was Pokemon Red and Blue, right?
00:16:49 We're going to split the fucking games along company lines.
00:16:53 Certainly half the Pokemon Game Freed gets to keep.
00:16:56 Half the fucking Pokemon you put in a separate company makes a competing Pokemon game, but
00:17:01 you can trade between the two.
00:17:03 And with this new system, we'll get two different games, and it's going to be the competing
00:17:08 gameplay development styles that each game does.
00:17:11 But you can trade between the two, and this is how we make actual competition.
00:17:15 We could do more than two companies.
00:17:17 We could make each Pokemon have its own game.
00:17:19 We got enough Pokemon.
00:17:20 It makes sense to me.
00:17:22 This is... do that, Game Freak.
00:17:24 Sell half Pokemon or something.
00:17:25 We just got to release Pokemon a Lightning Edition with all the Soniches in it.
00:17:29 That's it.
00:17:30 That's the solution.
00:17:31 Well, that's just going to top the charts.
00:17:33 It's not even a fair competition.
00:17:35 Oh boy, I sure do hate Pokemon.
00:17:40 I'm going to play it.
00:17:41 I'm kind of interested to see if they've learned any lessons from the last one, or if things
00:17:47 have gotten worse.
00:17:48 I'm very invested in that.
00:17:49 I'm not.
00:17:50 So I'm real curious.
00:17:51 Everything I've seen that's new in this game looks bad.
00:17:55 You can change their natures now.
00:17:58 I like that.
00:17:59 That's nice.
00:18:00 That's a plus.
00:18:01 Forcibly time-warping their backstories.
00:18:04 You would never shy.
00:18:05 Yeah.
00:18:06 I mean, that's kind of a negative thing, because now we're just saying that we're making it
00:18:10 more gamey and less personality-y, and there's some trade-off.
00:18:14 People do like the gamey-gamey shit.
00:18:16 Have you seen the 7-hour Omega Ruby review?
00:18:21 A couple times I've started, and I've gotten 20 minutes, and I've been like, I'll definitely
00:18:25 get back to this.
00:18:26 I know what you're saying about how it's gamey-er, but he makes a pretty good argument towards
00:18:32 the end that, okay, it's cute, and everything that, once you catch a Pokemon, you're stuck
00:18:38 with it.
00:18:39 But the practical effect of not being able to change anything is basically just, like,
00:18:46 if you want a particular nature, you can get it.
00:18:48 It just takes you 14 hours or whatever.
00:18:51 Yeah, it's not good.
00:18:52 But what if you want it on a shiny?
00:18:55 Well, that's going to take you forever.
00:18:58 Infinite time.
00:18:59 Yeah.
00:19:00 I think the implication of the game is that you're not supposed to grind until you have
00:19:03 the right nature.
00:19:04 You have to just work with what you find.
00:19:08 People like min-maxing, so they will play the game for 14 hours to get the right thing.
00:19:13 I feel like the game as it exists now could exist parallel along something like Pokemon
00:19:18 Showdown.
00:19:19 And I'm perfectly comfortable for all competitive Pokemon to be played on Pokemon Showdown
00:19:24 or something like that.
00:19:25 To me, I don't know.
00:19:26 If you...
00:19:27 Okay, something like...
00:19:28 I'm sure that changing your natures is a post-game thing that's not available right away.
00:19:33 You probably have to grind for it at some kind of battle arena.
00:19:37 Items.
00:19:38 Items.
00:19:39 Yeah.
00:19:40 I just don't know how you get those items.
00:19:41 It's probably...
00:19:42 Probably post-game.
00:19:43 There was the thing that you could change a Pokemon's ability.
00:19:46 You could switch between if a Pokemon had two different abilities.
00:19:49 And to do that, you needed an item, and you had to earn that item in the battle arena.
00:19:53 So it's probably something like that.
00:19:54 It's not going to be something that just any casual can do.
00:19:58 It's still going to be something that only hardcore players would care about.
00:20:02 I think it's probably good.
00:20:03 I think it's probably good for more options like that.
00:20:06 I'm just wondering the fact that it's going to be the hardcore players doing it.
00:20:09 It's hard to object that much, but at the same time, canonically, it's like we're changing
00:20:14 Pokemon's personalities, which is supposed to have...
00:20:16 It's already fucked up.
00:20:17 I mean, it's a little fucked up.
00:20:18 It's already fucked up.
00:20:19 Kind of.
00:20:20 I guess that's true.
00:20:21 I mean, like all you do, I think you give it a mint.
00:20:24 I think that that's the item, and it's a specific kind of mint.
00:20:28 So you're just giving them a treat, and that affects them.
00:20:34 It's such an impact in their life.
00:20:39 I won't, sir.
00:20:40 I won't.
00:20:41 Well, we shall see.
00:20:44 We shall see.
00:20:45 Let us know, folks.
00:20:46 What do you think of New Pokemon?
00:20:47 I'm honestly excited.
00:20:48 I'm probably in the very vast minority of this, but...
00:20:52 I wonder if there's going to be a new Pokemon for Smash for this game.
00:20:56 Definitely.
00:20:57 I want you to see Ice Q's true form.
00:21:03 Okay.
00:21:04 This is like a larger version of what's in that.
00:21:06 I was thinking it looked like a fucking Internet mascot thing or an Android device.
00:21:11 Okay.
00:21:12 Ignore the stuff on the left, but the two on the right, these are the images from the
00:21:16 leak.
00:21:17 They are.
00:21:18 They are.
00:21:19 Yeah, that's right.
00:21:20 Incredible.
00:21:21 It's a nightmare.
00:21:22 I hate it.
00:21:23 I know.
00:21:24 It's really bad.
00:21:25 It's really bad.
00:21:26 Look, I feel like this is on a new level from Klefki.
00:21:30 Everyone complained about Klefki.
00:21:31 Fuck off.
00:21:32 It's fine.
00:21:33 I like it.
00:21:34 It's cute.
00:21:35 Yeah.
00:21:36 But everyone hated it, and everyone hates Garbador, and everyone hates Vanillux.
00:21:39 It's cute.
00:21:40 And I just feel like compared to this, those don't even bear mentioning in terms of bad
00:21:46 Pokemon.
00:21:47 Yeah.
00:21:48 It's like, I guess the idea, like concept behind this, is a penguin fell into the ice
00:21:53 and got frozen head and different kind of head based on what's something, but like...
00:21:59 That doesn't make this Pokemon.
00:22:00 It doesn't make it an animal in pain.
00:22:02 It's like the ice doesn't have any relation to the rest of the body, even in color.
00:22:08 It's just a fucking penguin.
00:22:11 It's shit.
00:22:12 It's real shit.
00:22:13 It's not great.
00:22:14 I think it might be related to the melting ice caps, environmental message and stuff,
00:22:18 because...
00:22:19 Disgusting.
00:22:20 Because it doesn't justify...
00:22:21 Keep politics out of my video game, goddammit.
00:22:25 You could have done a fucking better job with that concept.
00:22:27 No, okay.
00:22:28 I got it.
00:22:29 I got it.
00:22:30 It's a new form of Avalog, and it's ice water, and it's just sort of drooping, and it looks
00:22:35 like it's had a stroke, and it's like in constant pain.
00:22:37 That makes sense.
00:22:38 All you need is a fucking emaciated Polar Bear Pokemon to show like, oh, it's bad.
00:22:43 We already have one.
00:22:44 Okay, an entire line of Pokemon just based on the melting ice caps.
00:22:48 You have horrifying melting Avalog.
00:22:50 You have emaciated, like losing its fur, mangy fucking, oh, what's the Polar Bear?
00:22:56 The big Cub Chew evolves into...
00:22:59 It's like Volar Bears.
00:23:00 No, that's the fucking League of Legends character.
00:23:02 Okay, you know the one I'm talking about.
00:23:03 I know it's done.
00:23:04 I think we literally made a better ice Pokemon in like an old procust, the freezer one,
00:23:11 right?
00:23:12 Yeah.
00:23:13 The cooler, the ice steel type.
00:23:14 Yeah.
00:23:15 The refrigerator.
00:23:16 Don't we already have one of those with what's-his-face Rotom, the refrigerator version of some
00:23:20 30-dice?
00:23:21 Yeah, but ours was cooler.
00:23:22 Okay, all right.
00:23:23 Fair enough.
00:23:24 Ice Rotom is electric.
00:23:25 Wait, what form?
00:23:26 Fridge form.
00:23:27 He's an electric ice.
00:23:28 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:23:29 It started as a cooler, it evolved into a fridge, and then it became a fucking iceberg.
00:23:36 It just went from human size to continent size.
00:23:41 Sick.
00:23:42 Now, okay, so just despite all our misgivings about Pokemon and whatnot, now that's all
00:23:48 true, it's dead boys, but the spirit of Pokemon lives on.
00:23:53 The real Pokemon game is over on PCP Minecraft server, patreon.com, PCP Minecraft.
00:23:59 It is the greatest place.
00:24:00 You can ride your Pokemon, you can sail through the sky, and it's literally where Pokemon
00:24:05 lives on.
00:24:06 Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you're listening to this on Friday, then tomorrow, Saturday,
00:24:10 we will be streaming, right?
00:24:12 No, no, no.
00:24:14 We're streaming before that.
00:24:15 That's when we're recording the bonus episode, which is unrelated.
00:24:17 But when are we streaming?
00:24:19 Like on Tuesday, a few days before this goes out.
00:24:22 Okay, we shouldn't discuss this on the show, but that's not what you said.
00:24:25 And the bonus episode, Claude, that is what he said.
00:24:27 We will read back the transcript, and that will be vindicated.
00:24:30 Okay, well never mind, ignore everything I just said.
00:24:32 You will have seen a stream and come play with us on the stream, and there will be
00:24:35 more to come, so, you know, get involved if you want.
00:24:38 I'm fine, I'm fine with this, because that's not what you fucking said.
00:24:41 Okay, fine, and Mage actually is looking forward, or is in the planning stages of a Pokemon
00:24:46 tournament on the server, so we're gearing up for that at some point in the future.
00:24:51 I need to work out some details.
00:24:52 I worked out the prizes, thankfully, so...
00:24:55 What are the prizes?
00:24:56 I'm immediately curious.
00:24:57 Okay, because people were a little bit wary about getting like OP Pokemon or something
00:25:02 that has prizes, the elected that maybe I should look into giving away like statues
00:25:08 of Pokemon, which could be doable, I just wasn't sure if I could do it on the server.
00:25:14 And with a little bit of fiddling and stuff, and googling things, I managed to find out
00:25:20 away how to do it, so yeah, I'll be giving prizes like statues of certain Pokemon.
00:25:25 You get to choose which Pokemon or something?
00:25:27 Well, I mean, for each...
00:25:28 You should have your team of Pokemon erected as statues, and put, oh, wouldn't that be
00:25:32 amazing for all time?
00:25:33 I'm sick.
00:25:34 Well, if we're going to do this monthly, which people have been actually asking to do it
00:25:39 like bi-weekly, but I said I couldn't be able to do it, yeah, so monthly, so no, I think
00:25:44 like each tournament or so will have its own Pokemon as a sort of like the theme mascot
00:25:51 or something.
00:25:52 Okay.
00:25:53 And that Pokemon will be the statue that you receive.
00:25:56 That is a...
00:25:57 We have like a pedestal where that Pokemon stands, and then next month it gets traded
00:26:00 out with the next person's winning in like a plaque or something.
00:26:02 I mean, that would be a great idea.
00:26:04 The thing is though, with the statues, they're not the kind of items you can put in your inventory,
00:26:08 so I'd have to place it somewhere in their claim, and they won't be able to move it.
00:26:14 I was wrong.
00:26:15 You said Monday.
00:26:16 Hey, there you go.
00:26:18 I'm the genius.
00:26:19 I did it.
00:26:20 So it's Monday now, Tuesday?
00:26:22 We are doing the stream on Monday.
00:26:24 That's correct.
00:26:25 Oh, okay.
00:26:26 Yes.
00:26:27 And this will be long past for all you people.
00:26:28 No, it'll be on Monday.
00:26:29 We'll do more in the future.
00:26:30 Wait, no.
00:26:31 No, it will be here.
00:26:32 We'll have happened on Monday.
00:26:33 Whoops.
00:26:34 Okay.
00:26:35 Fuck it.
00:26:36 All right.
00:26:37 Now, Pokemon talk.
00:26:38 No, never enough Pokemon.
00:26:39 Let's discuss other things in our lives.
00:26:41 Who's got some?
00:26:42 What else?
00:26:43 What else is there in our lives that there's in Pokemon?
00:26:45 Well, there's Slime and Punishment, which continues apace, developments are occurring,
00:26:53 Chris is tampering in the continuity some more.
00:26:57 My goal now, I will never compromise my artistic vision, but part of that artistic vision,
00:27:06 part of something that I find adds value to it, at least for me personally, the more of
00:27:11 Chris's lore that I can incorporate into it, the better.
00:27:15 So I'm eager when Chris does things or says things or says such and such about it, I'm
00:27:20 eager to be like, hmm, how can I work this in?
00:27:23 Because it's funny.
00:27:25 But he's making that complicated for, I mean, she is making this challenging for you, as
00:27:30 I recall.
00:27:31 I have mulled it over, she made a, yes, she made a, she drew another card showing Chris
00:27:38 Chan Sonichu retrieving Phantom Horn from the Time Void.
00:27:43 And I was distressed by this, because it, well, it wasn't what I had planned.
00:27:48 And also, because I, like, it was, I think she thought the comic was over, I think she
00:27:54 thought that was the end.
00:27:55 Like that was where that was the end of Phantom Horn's fate, which is so ridiculous.
00:27:59 You should have said to be continued.
00:28:01 I guess I should, I guess I should have not assumed that it wasn't obvious, that was obvious
00:28:07 that there was going to be another update.
00:28:09 Like, why would I even, why would I even show that version of Phantom with the Podron Horn
00:28:14 if that was going to be what ended, he would, if he just had no relevance to anything and
00:28:17 he just ended up drifting.
00:28:18 Because it's dark, dude.
00:28:19 I, you know, I guess, you know, I guess maybe, but no.
00:28:24 But it's fine.
00:28:25 I've mulled it over and I think I can work with what Chris made actually just this morning,
00:28:29 this morning before the show, before this recording, I cranked out another four panels
00:28:35 and posted them incorporating my redrawn version of that card.
00:28:41 And we'll, we'll, you know, maybe later today, there'll be more developments.
00:28:45 Excellent.
00:28:46 Yeah.
00:28:47 By the way, people do your favor.
00:28:49 And also, I guess I might as well mention this, Chris did suggest that she might show
00:28:53 up to my stream tonight, as in tonight when we're recording this, which would be really
00:28:57 fun and really funny and cool, but who knows if it'll actually happen, but she said it,
00:29:04 so I'm hopeful.
00:29:05 Does she mean like in the call or just in the chat?
00:29:08 She said she would be on Twitch.
00:29:11 So I mean, make of that, which you will.
00:29:13 You gotta make sure to add her when you post it your live, last ditch attempts to pull
00:29:19 them in.
00:29:20 Yeah.
00:29:21 Very true.
00:29:22 Very true.
00:29:23 I probably will.
00:29:24 But I think you'll find yourself swallowed whole, Ben, all by the sheer power, much like
00:29:29 if you go to the gross disgusting audio links where I just posted the picture I was looking
00:29:33 for of Gengar with this giant gaping mouthful.
00:29:36 Oh my God.
00:29:37 Isn't it glorious?
00:29:38 Now, that's what I'm talking about with Jaycanta Max.
00:29:40 I'm way into that.
00:29:42 Okay.
00:29:43 I can get excited about that.
00:29:46 Mega Gengar is like a little...
00:29:47 His little hands.
00:29:48 Look at his little hands.
00:29:49 Yeah, it is.
00:29:50 He's going yes.
00:29:51 Yeah.
00:29:52 It is.
00:29:53 It's Mega Gengar, but just like with his mouth really wide open.
00:29:55 No, it's not Mega Gengar.
00:29:56 Mega Gengar has three eyes.
00:29:58 Oh, that's...
00:29:59 Yeah, that's true.
00:30:00 And he's not.
00:30:01 It's just because he has those Mega Gengar Liggies, that's why I assumed.
00:30:07 No.
00:30:08 Okay.
00:30:09 No.
00:30:10 I mean, maybe this is...
00:30:11 No, this is just regular Gengar hands sticking up out of the ground going, boo.
00:30:14 Oh, okay.
00:30:15 I'm sorry.
00:30:16 But while we're on this, just look at this other art I found.
00:30:19 This would also have been a dope-ass Mega Gengar, but this is not real.
00:30:23 That's cute.
00:30:24 It's pretty cool.
00:30:25 Yeah, I saw that one.
00:30:27 I can Google things too.
00:30:29 All right.
00:30:30 Good work.
00:30:31 Okay.
00:30:32 Enough of that.
00:30:33 Enough of that.
00:30:34 Yes.
00:30:35 We did it.
00:30:36 I was just going to say, I'm putting fucking slime and punishment up on Topastic and Webtoon.
00:30:41 I would really like for it to get followers and especially likes on Webtoon, and it's
00:30:48 very hard and I hate it.
00:30:50 It's got like 40 followers, which is like nothing, and I'm depressed.
00:30:56 That's pretty low.
00:30:57 What I'm going to do is say like when you update from Twitter, just say go over to Thing
00:31:01 to read it, and then they'll have to go in.
00:31:04 Yeah.
00:31:05 But a lot of people just don't do that.
00:31:06 A lot of people wouldn't do that.
00:31:07 You've got to force them to do that.
00:31:08 Otherwise, they just won't.
00:31:09 They just won't follow you.
00:31:10 I would do that.
00:31:11 I would do that.
00:31:12 But in particular, the thing about that is that Chris would never see it.
00:31:14 Yeah, I mean, that's true.
00:31:15 Chris would never see it if I weren't posting it on Twitter.
00:31:19 What if you just post a preview of the page without the whole page and just like if you
00:31:24 want to know what actually happened, go to this page.
00:31:27 You can expect only a bare minimum of effort from Chris, I think, and other people might
00:31:31 work.
00:31:32 I mean, you could do like a, you know, it's live now for people who are following and
00:31:37 then, you know, three, four hours later, you post it on Twitter for Chris, just so it's
00:31:44 all there on Twitter as well.
00:31:46 Even though I have been doing more and better work than I have ever done in my entire life,
00:31:52 for months now, my Patreon has stagnated and in fact only gone down a bit.
00:31:57 So that's cool.
00:31:58 That's good.
00:31:59 Life's gone great for me.
00:32:01 I feel that, dude.
00:32:02 I feel that hardcore the worst.
00:32:05 But you know what?
00:32:06 I don't care.
00:32:07 I'm going to do it anyway.
00:32:08 I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing my thing.
00:32:10 And that's it.
00:32:11 There and out.
00:32:12 That's what I've been thinking.
00:32:13 That's what it's about.
00:32:14 That's how it's done.
00:32:17 In terms of like public things, I've been doing really nothing, but I've been working
00:32:20 very hard on comic things in the background.
00:32:23 Uh, yeah, I have, I have a vaporette to draw now.
00:32:28 I have read no art to finish.
00:32:30 I have a whole thing, uh, I won't say.
00:32:34 But then after that, after all that, I've gotten more comics and more things and more
00:32:39 scripts and writing and it's like, ooh, I wish, I wish I was like, um, posting stuff
00:32:45 regularly and being like, you know, keeping up with, uh, stuff and, and, uh, engagement
00:32:53 or whatever the fuck it is.
00:32:55 Mm-hmm.
00:32:56 Engagement is good.
00:32:58 You would, which you can find plenty of over on me and Digi's new channel kind of intent
00:33:02 with, with, you know, I was thinking, if I put up a green screen, would you throw me
00:33:07 into an episode?
00:33:08 Oh, we, we made this specifically with the hope that we could involve you guys in various
00:33:14 projects that would be of note to you.
00:33:16 For example, Tom, uh, talking about Beastars is already intended to be done at some point.
00:33:22 Uh, I didn't see your video about it, but I wanted to because I like Beastars.
00:33:27 It's worth it.
00:33:28 It's worth it.
00:33:29 Beastars is fucking sick.
00:33:30 Yeah.
00:33:31 Tom will tell you all day.
00:33:32 Oh, I'm glad.
00:33:33 I'm glad.
00:33:34 Shout out to May for dropping into my DMs like two weeks ago.
00:33:36 I was like, can you to watch Beastars?
00:33:37 Main character is you.
00:33:38 And the first episode you was like.
00:33:39 Oh, she told you to watch, huh?
00:33:40 She, she did.
00:33:41 She was the one who turned me on to it and then I became addicted.
00:33:44 She's the one who turns you on to it and then you got turned on all by yourself.
00:33:47 Yeah.
00:33:48 The rest is all me, baby.
00:33:51 Are you, I'm interested.
00:33:53 Now I'm kind of curious because I've seen some of the show.
00:33:55 How do you relate to Lugosi?
00:33:57 Do you, I mean, you are a very tall boy.
00:33:58 Similar to Lugosi.
00:33:59 Uh, I don't know.
00:34:00 I didn't, uh, uh, uh, just, I asked May like what, how I was the main character because
00:34:05 the two main characters are just like sad, not socially functioning people.
00:34:10 Kinda.
00:34:11 And I was like, I guess that's true.
00:34:12 I guess that makes sense.
00:34:13 And that was just like, he's like tall and awkward and has like moments of rage.
00:34:18 I'm like, yeah, that's about right.
00:34:19 I guess so.
00:34:20 He doesn't, and it kind of looks like you a little bit.
00:34:22 I guess so.
00:34:23 This is a tall thin thing, I guess, but, um, I'm okay being compared to Lugosi, especially
00:34:27 as his arc continues throughout the manga and becomes fucking sick.
00:34:30 Does he ever go beast mode and unlock his superpowers and, you know, I will not spoil
00:34:35 anything, but if you think that this show is what it appears to be, you are so mistaken.
00:34:39 It's not even fine.
00:34:40 People have been saying that it's, I thought it was just a high school drama.
00:34:43 People are like, no, no, no, no.
00:34:44 And I'm like, okay.
00:34:45 All right.
00:34:46 Fair enough.
00:34:47 I've been watching it and I, and I keep thinking just like, I still don't have a feel on this
00:34:52 show.
00:34:53 It just, I don't know what it, what I'm supposed to feel about it.
00:34:55 Like, what is this?
00:34:56 What is this show?
00:34:57 I don't know.
00:34:58 You know, cause I was so just thinking just, oh, like it's literally just a J drama, but
00:35:02 with animal boys, but I, and it's hard for me to imagine how it's going to not do that.
00:35:07 But I guess it's going to.
00:35:08 Wait, haven't, didn't you do a calm turn?
00:35:11 On Beastars with Digi?
00:35:12 Well, yeah, but it was only four episodes long or three.
00:35:16 You couldn't get a feel for what it was about from four.
00:35:19 Well, yeah.
00:35:20 What we're saying is what the feeling we got seemed very much like a J drama, but everyone
00:35:25 is saying, nah, nah, nah, you guys don't know what you're in for.
00:35:28 Well, okay.
00:35:29 Okay.
00:35:30 Just like, okay.
00:35:31 The show is a drama.
00:35:32 Like that is what it is about.
00:35:33 It's just that the scope and the stakes and the scale expand far beyond what it initially
00:35:38 seems to present.
00:35:39 Sure.
00:35:40 Oh, so it's like Homestuck.
00:35:41 I wouldn't know.
00:35:43 Shut up.
00:35:44 So it's like, it's like, it's like Dogstock.
00:35:46 It's like Catstock.
00:35:48 I mean, Homestuck from the very beginning was about, at the very least, all of Earth
00:35:53 in jeopardy of, yeah, I mean, it was destroyed or, kind of, kind of.
00:35:58 It escalates real quick.
00:35:59 It got to like multiversal stuff though, so fair enough, I guess.
00:36:02 Act One is like a boy in his room, fucking around, and then at the end of Act One, there's
00:36:07 a meteor coming to kill him, and from there it escalates.
00:36:09 All right, Gib, riddle me this.
00:36:11 Who would win in a fight, Homestuck or Gurren Lagan?
00:36:14 Who wins that fight?
00:36:16 In terms of like the characters and their power levels fighting each other, or like...
00:36:21 You know, we already thought too much about it, never mind.
00:36:23 No, I think Homestuck would win, because of Kaliope, of dead Kaliope making the big black
00:36:32 hole that would suck up a giant, universe-sized camera.
00:36:36 Well, here's your problem, Gib.
00:36:37 Kaliope is a weak...
00:36:38 She's destroyed.
00:36:39 Could never defeat the masculine energy of God-community-spirited.
00:36:42 Nah, she'd suck him right up.
00:36:44 She'd suck him right down into that black hole, if you know what I'm saying.
00:36:47 She'd probably give him...
00:36:48 I was gonna say she'll give him a Me Too moment, he'll never forget, but I just hope to be
00:36:56 a part of it.
00:36:57 All right.
00:36:58 What are we talking about?
00:36:59 I can't remember.
00:37:00 I don't know.
00:37:01 We got here.
00:37:02 Obie Stars.
00:37:03 We subscribed to Can-Tent to watch our fan page.
00:37:05 Recently.
00:37:06 We subscribed to Can-Tent.
00:37:07 Oh, but Gib, you were saying if you could be on a green screen, yes, and I'm curious
00:37:10 if there's anything that you are interested in.
00:37:13 Well, I don't know whether I'm interested in discussing anything, but I have recently...
00:37:17 My brother bought like five green screen sheets a while ago, but he's never had a use for
00:37:23 them, and we were clearing out his room, and he gave them to me, and now I have enough
00:37:27 green screen to green screen an entire room from all around me, and I was just thinking
00:37:32 of...
00:37:33 Nice.
00:37:35 Green screen is like the progenitor of creativity.
00:37:37 If I have a big green screen, and I'm thinking, I want to make a video now, I'm just going
00:37:41 to sit here with a microphone in my hand in a void of green and talk about nothing in
00:37:47 particular, and I want to film it.
00:37:49 You know who does this good work with that formula?
00:37:51 Green screen power, and yet here we are, a whole room at your disposal.
00:37:55 Indeed.
00:37:56 Truly terrible.
00:37:57 Nakey Jakey, with his writing and stuff, people like him a lot, but he generally sits
00:38:01 on a bouncy ball in a green screen, and then edits himself moving around.
00:38:04 Yeah, it's a good thing.
00:38:06 I like his style with that shit.
00:38:08 I probably do a combination of that top-down green screen thing, but also the stupid...
00:38:17 If you remember all of the green screen videos I've made, I forget the names of them, but
00:38:23 there's all give and take videos where I'm just holding a green thing, and I'm fucking
00:38:27 around and saying stuff to the camera, and it's just fun.
00:38:30 It's just fun keying things.
00:38:31 The spirit was continued into a GRPJ to increase that.
00:38:34 GRPJ throwing the final fantasy, I just threw the green screen in the background, and that's
00:38:39 the green screen, that's the game footage.
00:38:43 It's really fun.
00:38:44 It's good.
00:38:45 And then obviously the huge universe-shattering video, GRPJ Super Mario RPG, where it's just
00:38:53 my floating head.
00:38:55 Right.
00:38:58 Some people, maybe you guys, I don't know if you saw this or anything, but on some of
00:39:03 the content videos that Digi and I have done, the initial ones were in person with a green
00:39:08 screen, but in the later ones, the whole premise is we green screen ourselves separately so
00:39:13 we can kind of add them together.
00:39:14 Digi's video quality is so much better than mine, and yet you still have people being
00:39:19 like, or rather on one video, where we actually were together, that was released after this,
00:39:23 where we were like, man, this one's weird, because it's weird to see Digi and Nate pretending
00:39:28 to be in the same room together, because now I know they're not, but no, we actually
00:39:32 were in the same room in that video.
00:39:33 Look at the fucking film.
00:39:36 It's amusing to see.
00:39:37 So people are fooled.
00:39:39 People are convinced by the rudimentary trickery of the style, so low bar to cross for all
00:39:45 that stuff, I guess.
00:39:48 Ooh, and I'm happy to report, folks, we have crossed the threshold where we now are applying
00:39:53 for monetization on content, and the pennies are just going to roll in, baby.
00:39:59 Very excited.
00:40:00 Speaking of monetization on content, so I had trouble when I was uploading the Ben
00:40:05 Saint vs. Digi Bro stream, it kept, man, I was so careful with it, I would go in and
00:40:14 I would change the title, and I would change the thumbnail, and I would change the description
00:40:18 and the tags and stuff, and I would like, and sometimes, and it kept tagging it as unfit
00:40:23 for monetization, limited monetization, and I uploaded it, and I re-uploaded it a bunch
00:40:27 of times, and I finally got it, I finally got it, so that it was not flagged for that,
00:40:34 and then I released it, and then immediately it gets flagged, and this happened twice,
00:40:38 this happened twice, but, you know, I actually, I, okay, it sucks, because, you know, it's
00:40:44 already got a couple thousand views, and those were not monetized, but I applied for review,
00:40:49 and they approved it, so it is monetized now, like I wanted it to be, so I guess that's
00:40:54 a win.
00:40:55 You know, I don't know if people are aware of this, but public service announcement,
00:40:58 like just for example, the PCP, now the PCP does not always get monetized, but, or rather,
00:41:03 it'll get like the yellow lower monetization thing or whatever, which just means it doesn't
00:41:07 run ads, right?
00:41:08 Which basically just means it doesn't run ads, right?
00:41:09 Or it doesn't make money from ads?
00:41:11 It gets like the very lowest bottom tier ads, or none at all, I think, is, I think that's
00:41:17 the idea.
00:41:18 So, so when I upload the, right now, we try to get the episodes done by Wednesday, because
00:41:23 the episode needs to go up Friday, and the reason we give it a big window is specifically
00:41:26 so we have like a full day at least, to, we upload it, it will basically always get limited
00:41:32 monetization, we appeal it, and then most of the time, in that day or two, it will get
00:41:37 like, you know, manually reviewed, and then it'll be monetized.
00:41:40 So like, we have to build in like a day or two of waiting period for this shit, for the
00:41:45 whole system, which I do on my channel too, and I don't know, you guys probably do on
00:41:48 yours, it's a big fucking pain, but now that just seems to be what you gotta do to make
00:41:53 sure you get, you know, all the full money you're trying to get from it.
00:41:56 It doesn't even guarantee it, because you can always get re-hit later.
00:41:58 That's, yeah, I mean, it's always true.
00:42:00 And I guess I will double this by saying, use this opportunity to say, go to my channel,
00:42:06 watch me debate Digi about Yang and Bernie and stuff.
00:42:10 Did I tell you that video got 1,000 views on the VOD on Twitch, which is like, ridiculous
00:42:16 for Twitch, to get 1,000 views on one VOD.
00:42:20 Like 20 views on a VOD is like, wow, this is really, really popping off.
00:42:24 That's pretty normal.
00:42:25 Maybe 50 for like a real humdinger.
00:42:27 Yeah, yeah.
00:42:28 I don't know.
00:42:30 Nobody watches anything on Twitch, because I can't watch VODs as much.
00:42:35 It's terrible.
00:42:36 The player is terrible on Twitch, so I don't blame them.
00:42:38 You have all that live content right at your fingertips.
00:42:40 I'm not going to watch something from a while ago.
00:42:43 That's bullshit.
00:42:45 Make some sense.
00:42:46 Make some sense.
00:42:47 There was one time when I went on to like an RFCK stream, and I didn't realize that
00:42:52 what was playing was an old stream that I hadn't seen before.
00:42:55 And the chat was rolling, and I was talking to people as if they could hear me.
00:43:00 You can type in the chat while it's like past history chat.
00:43:06 Yeah.
00:43:07 Nobody responds, because you weren't there.
00:43:09 And I was like, what the fuck?
00:43:11 I'm getting flamed by everyone.
00:43:12 When was an old stream playing on RFCK?
00:43:15 No, it's just the thing that happens.
00:43:18 If you go to a streaming channel when they're not currently streaming, it will like maybe
00:43:25 auto-play like the last thing that was like saved.
00:43:29 I have never seen it do that, but perhaps it's true.
00:43:35 I mean, maybe I clicked on it, I can't remember, but like either way, I was really annoyed
00:43:38 at everyone, and then I paused it.
00:43:41 I paused the stream and realized that the chat stopped as well, and I felt stupid.
00:43:46 I just wanted a response of some kind.
00:43:50 I was thinking of going to Discord, and I was like, wait a minute, they're talking about
00:43:53 old shit.
00:43:54 Oh no.
00:43:55 Weird.
00:43:56 Yep.
00:43:57 Yep.
00:43:58 How very dehumanizing.
00:44:00 You're making like real solid posts, you're like having a real good time with your friends,
00:44:07 and like hours later you suddenly realize, wait a minute, it's fake.
00:44:11 Nothing was real.
00:44:12 Like I don't know why they allow you to chat unless like VODs can have-
00:44:15 That's strange.
00:44:16 It's like-
00:44:17 Why would you want to?
00:44:18 I think potentially it's like if multiple people watch the video back and they add their
00:44:26 chat in the moment, then it shows up if somebody watches it again.
00:44:31 So like you can continually add to the chat, it's just the chat is no longer talking to
00:44:35 each other, really.
00:44:37 You're just going in and adding your thoughts or something.
00:44:42 Yeah.
00:44:43 Very weird.
00:44:44 You're changing the stream.
00:44:45 So for other people who watch it back later could see it, I guess, I don't know.
00:44:47 I don't know if it displays separately, because you can do this on YouTube too, if you like
00:44:51 watch back live streams, I mean at least you can see the chat going.
00:44:56 I'm not totally sure if you can comment or not on those.
00:44:58 I don't think so.
00:44:59 I'm not sure, honestly.
00:45:00 Yeah.
00:45:01 I don't think so.
00:45:02 I'm not sure, honestly.
00:45:03 Imagine if you made the mistake of sending a super chat of an old stream.
00:45:07 They didn't even say your name on stream.
00:45:12 Somebody did cheer me while I was sleeping on stream.
00:45:15 Okay, but that was a live stream.
00:45:17 Yeah, it was technically live, even though I was dead.
00:45:21 You were probably saying, Ben, we're reaching out to you from the real world.
00:45:27 You've been unconscious for 50 years.
00:45:29 We're trying to wake you up, but oh, but you've missed out too bad.
00:45:34 How did you fall asleep on a stream?
00:45:38 Did you, what happened?
00:45:39 Did I not talk about that?
00:45:40 Maybe you weren't here.
00:45:41 I did talk about it.
00:45:42 You got drunk.
00:45:43 I just accidentally, yeah, I got really drunk.
00:45:44 I ended the stream.
00:45:45 I accidentally restarted it.
00:45:47 I have no idea how, but I did.
00:45:50 Then I went to bed and slept for like six hours in a pitch dark room, and that's what
00:45:58 happened.
00:45:59 You should upload that to YouTube.
00:46:00 You got a lot of watch time on that.
00:46:01 No, I deleted it because I was embarrassed.
00:46:03 I don't blame you.
00:46:04 What did the camera show, just like an empty chair or something?
00:46:07 No, it was just blank.
00:46:08 Because I turned the lights off.
00:46:10 Did the people hear you snore in the background?
00:46:13 I don't know.
00:46:14 I mean.
00:46:15 No, no, no.
00:46:16 Now it's gone.
00:46:17 It's been banned.
00:46:18 Some devious man has like a bank now of Ben snore clips.
00:46:24 No, don't even joke about that.
00:46:28 I don't think I snore.
00:46:31 No one's ever told me that I snore.
00:46:32 At least not regularly.
00:46:33 Yeah, so you'll never know if you snore or not until people tell you.
00:46:37 I mean, everybody does it sometimes.
00:46:39 People are going to start like, here's some proof.
00:46:42 Like a black video and then just a snore sound effect.
00:46:45 This is Ben.
00:46:46 Oh yeah, you just play that.
00:46:48 Proof.
00:46:49 So that's what's up.
00:46:52 What else is on your mind, ladies and gentlemen?
00:46:55 Well, speaking about that YouTube stuff, what was that the p-score thing?
00:47:00 I watched that video Tom mentioned.
00:47:02 It was fucking weird, right?
00:47:04 There was this thing, people, like a community of people, there was this video of this guy
00:47:12 talking about it.
00:47:13 Remember that there is a hidden p-score that you can find that is basically, I don't know
00:47:20 how it's calculated, but it's definitely tampered with to inflate on YouTube, right?
00:47:26 On YouTube.
00:47:27 To inflate the importance or whatever.
00:47:30 I forget what the p stands for, I think like profitability or something of that.
00:47:34 There's like four or five different p's that they average, like you rank your channel on,
00:47:36 then average them out to give you your p-score and that determines whether your ads are limited
00:47:40 even if you have green monetization on them or not.
00:47:43 Just as one example, you've seen Munchy rack up a significant p-store score on this very
00:47:48 podcast on occasion.
00:47:49 Yes.
00:47:50 But like the gist of what they found was people with lower p-scores, they get a green monetization
00:47:59 ding or whatever.
00:48:00 They're not like yellow box demonetized, but the ads they get, the rates are lower than
00:48:07 people with higher p-scores because their work is like dubbed less or more ad-friendly.
00:48:17 Ad-friendly stuff that's still technically monetized, like the PCP, I'm sure, has lower
00:48:21 ad rates than a baby cat channel or whatever that is completely safe and gets exactly the
00:48:28 same amount of watch time.
00:48:29 It would get more money.
00:48:31 And they found this out through inspecting the metadata of the website.
00:48:39 And that video was, I watched it a week after it was uploaded.
00:48:43 By that time, it was completely gone.
00:48:45 You couldn't actually do it anymore.
00:48:46 The YouTube stuff were very quick to act and edit the code so that you couldn't see it.
00:48:53 But they made a huge list of a bunch of notable YouTubers and their p-scores.
00:48:59 And of course, the very, very, very top of the list where people like Stephen Colbert,
00:49:05 the late show with some fuck, this, that, and the other news thing, the BBC news or whatever.
00:49:14 All these big companies that are varying levels of watch time viewers, ship and subscribers,
00:49:20 but they've all got perfect p-scores regardless of the content they post because YouTube wants
00:49:24 to promote them and give them money so that they will stay on the site and bring viewership
00:49:29 to the site, I guess.
00:49:32 But it's shady, shady and shitty, and I don't like it.
00:49:38 I mean, I get it, I get the reasoning, but it's just like, why'd you gotta be so sneaky
00:49:43 about it?
00:49:44 Obviously, we don't like it when we find out.
00:49:46 You're gonna, when you're gonna learn that, like, they talk so, they talk such a big game
00:49:53 about like, we're gonna be transparent with you.
00:49:55 That was all in 2018.
00:49:57 Such transparency, Susan Wojcicki was going all over the place saying, we're gonna be
00:50:01 so straight with you, and then we find out this, and it's like, okay, sure.
00:50:07 I'm like, you're not even surprised, you're just disappointed, you're just like, of course.
00:50:11 Yeah?
00:50:12 Well, let me play Hitler's Advocate for a moment, as I like to do.
00:50:15 Your favorite game to play.
00:50:18 I mean, every company is gonna have some things they don't share with everybody, and we know
00:50:23 that there's these degrees of, oh, okay, like, a company has to decide, like, YouTube.
00:50:27 Obviously, they're gonna have some algorithm for, at the very least, to determine, like,
00:50:31 they've got ads, companies pay them to put their ads on videos, okay, they've now got
00:50:35 to determine what goes where.
00:50:37 Presumably, not everybody's paying the same amount, and I mean, there's multiple ways
00:50:40 they could decide which ad goes in which place, or whatever the fuck.
00:50:45 So they need some system, and I guess this is that system, in effect, anyway.
00:50:51 I mean, the literal number is not really, like, nobody could find out how the number
00:50:56 was calculated exactly, it was just the fact that channels, based on something, were determined
00:51:03 to be teens, or for kids, you know, suitable for kids, or teens, or adults, or there was
00:51:12 like a scale, and you were in a number of classes, the more risqué you were, the less
00:51:19 money you would make.
00:51:22 But you know, it's one thing to not have the information of what your channel is deemed
00:51:28 as, like, but it's also very confusing, because some of the channels were like, that they
00:51:36 looked into were like, they're seen as like teen channels, I forget the terminology, but
00:51:44 like, suitable for teens, not for children, some swear words, this or that, but the content
00:51:52 was not like overtly anything bad, it was actually quite safe.
00:51:57 You have to be, like, strangely safe in order to get the super safe category.
00:52:02 I see, I see.
00:52:04 I mean, maybe you could link to the video, because it was pretty in-depth, and I liked
00:52:10 the discussion.
00:52:11 It was just sort of like, I don't know, I mean, I'm not in the YouTube game anymore,
00:52:16 but this stuff still annoys me.
00:52:19 It concerns me, I mean, at the very least, if you're on YouTube as I am, like, you really
00:52:25 need to know these things, and watch, like, the Creator Insider videos that they release
00:52:29 about like updates, and just be aware, because like, you know, it's their platform, and you're
00:52:33 a guest, and you want to make sure you are aware if your efforts are being used in the
00:52:37 best possible ways.
00:52:39 But this reminded me of a couple other things I heard about this recently, like, I mean,
00:52:42 for one, Filthy Frank's vomit cake got taken down, specific, like, there was a specific
00:52:48 reason for why it was taken down, that I think, like, Bedhead Bernie noticed or something
00:52:53 retweeted, and it was like, due to it being not in alignment with like, YouTube's values,
00:52:59 or like, something like that, it's available online, maybe we'll see if I can find it later
00:53:04 on.
00:53:05 And then there was another thing.
00:53:06 There was something about how, like, there's a, I don't know if this is manifested in any
00:53:11 negative ways yet, but I heard some people, I think Sticks, Hex and Hammer talked about
00:53:14 this, there's a new, there's a new, like, degree of determining if YouTube channels
00:53:20 are like, wanted on YouTube at all, or possibly for monetization, it's not quite clear yet,
00:53:25 but the criteria for this now is specifically commercial viability of YouTube, not of the
00:53:32 channel, of YouTube, like, so seemingly the idea here appears to be that, will this channel
00:53:38 being here be commercially viable for YouTube itself?
00:53:42 Sounds like they're being a bit of a publisher right now, sounds like they're not being free
00:53:46 speech boys, I mean, that's fine, make your choice, but you know, let's not have it both
00:53:51 ways.
00:53:52 But there's a lot of shit that comes with it that they're not proven to at this point.
00:53:54 So I mean, I don't know, again, the full ramifications of that, I don't know yet, I just heard about
00:53:58 that recently, but well, I mean, you know, we're just marching down the path of, I mean,
00:54:03 again, it's fine, it's fine, be a publisher if you want to be, but it's just frustrating
00:54:07 to try to have it both ways.
00:54:08 Yeah, it's always been about like, they couldn't possibly explain that they are like, they
00:54:15 have values, because then everybody who doesn't share those values will be upset, so they
00:54:19 have to keep everything secret and just tweak things in the background, and it's like, everyone
00:54:25 hates that, everyone dislike that, stop.
00:54:28 Yeah, there it is.
00:54:30 Well, just got to know that going into the game, baby, I'm aware, I'll keep that in
00:54:36 mind as I make business decisions for myself involving YouTube going forward.
00:54:40 Yeah, that's all there is, I guess.
00:54:44 Oh, fuck YouTube.
00:54:46 Why'd you say fuck you to me?
00:54:49 Because I want to get demonetized.
00:54:51 Are you calling it a tube as well?
00:54:53 How rude.
00:54:54 Oh, guys, what's the point of it all, you know, what are we doing it for?
00:55:00 Oh, you want to get a secret of NIMS, a reason to live?
00:55:05 You want to know the meaning of life?
00:55:08 Right.
00:55:09 Please.
00:55:10 Okay, here's the meaning of life, it's to play the new Pokemon.
00:55:17 Oh, we're so starved for Pokemon, we need that to live.
00:55:24 I can't wait until next week's episode where we'll talk about Pokemon again.
00:55:31 We will discuss it to some degree, I'm sure.
00:55:32 Why?
00:55:33 Oh, because the game will be out.
00:55:34 It'll be out, it'll be out, you know, things to say.
00:55:37 Like, yeah, it's good, like, huh, yeah, it's Pokemon.
00:55:41 It's pretty good, I got a Pokemon, you know, I caught one, that's pretty good.
00:55:46 I got Pokeballs.
00:55:47 Yeah, it's a hell of a life.
00:55:49 It made me remember how I liked the other games, because it was the same, 10 out of
00:55:55 10.
00:55:56 It was able to distract me enough from playing this game to remember the old games that,
00:56:00 you know, pretty positive experience overall.
00:56:02 The meaning of life is stupid, like, as a question, so I don't care anymore about it.
00:56:08 I'm just going to live, and I'll find out after I'm dead, I don't need to think about
00:56:12 it at the moment, I'll figure it out later.
00:56:15 In terms of philosophical discussion, you know, I was playing on stream, Twitch.tv
00:56:19 slash definitely best guy ever.
00:56:22 What was it?
00:56:23 Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, and there was an intellectual philosophical discussion
00:56:27 between Monsoon and our boy, Raiden, and they were like, why do you kill Raiden?
00:56:32 People, they don't choose their circumstances, why do you kill him?
00:56:35 And he just said, I'm going to let her rip, baby, I'm just born to kill, and I kill to
00:56:39 be born, basically an appeal to nature, which is a logical fallacy, if you ask me.
00:56:45 But nonetheless, just do what feels good is basically the argument.
00:56:49 Nade's trying to make his stream out to be like, it was like, you know, a deep philosophical
00:56:54 conversation, but Nade over here is like the maestro of memes with the whole soundboard
00:56:58 of like constant reaction sounds, oh wait, this conversation's going on, so I'd use them,
00:57:03 but you guys wouldn't be able to hear it before recording them, too bad, too bad.
00:57:06 I've thought about like having a soundboard, just so that I can have my own lexicon of
00:57:13 funny sounds.
00:57:15 My vocabulary has expanded a dozen fold based on this meme menagerie I have in my fingertips
00:57:22 on my streams.
00:57:23 Oh, I know how I deal with blobs, because my language would not be complete without
00:57:28 including blobs every now and then.
00:57:31 I have one of you, Mage, in mind as well, it's you going, she's such anormy, as famously
00:57:36 everyone knows.
00:57:37 It's a wonderful little clip.
00:57:38 No, no.
00:57:41 You know what, there was one classic Internet Nate boy, you know, the other day, Michelle
00:57:46 got a call from her boss and the boss just said on the phone, I could hear it, because
00:57:49 it was just loud, she just said the clip, you're a rockstar, just like that, and I wanted
00:57:55 so bad, I mean, she was, because she like agreed to like take a shift or something,
00:57:59 and just you're a rockstar, and I just wish I had that captured, because it was so fucking
00:58:05 funny.
00:58:06 What's that?
00:58:07 Needlessly.
00:58:08 I mean, it was her voice, she was saying, this is a human being, she was speaking to
00:58:13 you on the phone, there was no recording, there was no...
00:58:15 Oh, you wanted that to be a sound, I see.
00:58:18 I wish I had captured that in some way, so I could make it a meme sound, because it was
00:58:21 really funny.
00:58:23 Maybe I'll use my own voice, saying it here on this very podcast.
00:58:26 You've just got to have Odess seem like recording at all times.
00:58:31 I wish I, if this was going to be like Michelle, okay, call her back and just ask, what am
00:58:34 I again?
00:58:36 Michelle, I'm going to need you to walk through that conversation one more time, and I'm going
00:58:39 to be recording this time.
00:58:42 That would be ideal, I wish I could do that.
00:58:44 I wish I could do that.
00:58:45 Oh well, that's life, baby.
00:58:48 Fuck, yeah.
00:58:49 I'm gamifying my whole life.
00:58:52 We got any more shit to talk about, do you want to go to voicemails, is it too early
00:58:56 for that?
00:58:57 I'm curious, I'm curious if the quality of the voicemails improved since the last time
00:59:01 we did.
00:59:02 We had one last week, didn't we?
00:59:03 Just one.
00:59:04 I can tell you one.
00:59:05 Well, I can tell you we have six this time, so that's an improvement.
00:59:08 Hang on, I'm wrecking my brain right now.
00:59:11 I thought I had a topic right here, right here in my brain, in my noggin.
00:59:15 Is it coming?
00:59:16 My topic is the tropics.
00:59:17 Is it here?
00:59:18 Is it going?
00:59:19 Is it going?
00:59:20 That's gone.
00:59:21 I mean, if you think of it, we can get back to, if you think of it, let's fucking talk
00:59:25 about it.
00:59:26 But all right, let's fucking go to the voicemails, and that'll take a good two, three hours to
00:59:29 get through, so let's see how it goes.
00:59:32 All right, let me see here.
00:59:33 Okay, first one.
00:59:34 Oh, of course, everybody, speak pipe, link down below in the description, leave us your
00:59:38 epic voicemails.
00:59:39 Make some short and sweet, baby.
00:59:41 Brevity is the soul of wit.
00:59:43 I can tell you most voicemails that otherwise might have made it are just too long.
00:59:48 They're just too fucking long, and they're not fun.
00:59:50 A joke gets so much less funny when it stretched out over like a minute, as opposed to being
00:59:55 20 seconds long.
00:59:57 Keep that in mind, folks.
00:59:58 That is the biggest determiner for me, if you get on or not.
01:00:01 Oh, wait, I remembered it.
01:00:02 It was tangentially related to meaning of life.
01:00:07 Meaning of life is to work hard and be cool, and I have, for the past month, two months,
01:00:14 I actually remember, I have been strictly regimenting my online habits, my internet usage, my phone,
01:00:24 and it has been really good.
01:00:26 I've got that schedule, I've got that lifestyle, and I think I said a while ago I was going
01:00:32 to do exercising.
01:00:34 I've kept that up every other day, 20 minutes on the exercise bike, on the old leg thing.
01:00:42 That's got to the point where it's not even a question.
01:00:44 I just get up, if it's like, did I do it yesterday?
01:00:46 No, I didn't.
01:00:47 And then I go, and I do that, and I'm exercising, so that's one good thing.
01:00:52 Two good things is the cold turkey thing I have, so I've made it so that, because today
01:01:01 is a weekend.
01:01:02 It's a weekend as a free day, and I was planning to work a bit on the weekend.
01:01:05 But of course, I was spending the entire time watching on cinema at the cinema and playing
01:01:10 Kenchi all day, not doing the work I was going to do, but that's okay, because throughout
01:01:18 the whole week, I have been like keeping with, like been unable to not fuck up my work schedule.
01:01:26 I've been making great progress on my comic things.
01:01:31 The other, yesterday, I drew like five pages, sketched five pages of the thing, and there's
01:01:38 like, yeah, it's really good.
01:01:42 And also going to bed, and waking up at the right time, and having a cup of joe, and uh...
01:01:51 I got mine right here.
01:01:52 Like a real boy.
01:01:53 Yeah, I'm like a human being or something.
01:01:55 I'm waking up early enough so that I get the early morning news and be like, ah yes, Brexit.
01:02:01 Yes, that sucks.
01:02:02 Ah, the election.
01:02:03 Yes, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson.
01:02:05 Oh yeah, we're past Halloween.
01:02:06 That didn't happen, did it?
01:02:07 No, it didn't happen.
01:02:08 There's an election going on now.
01:02:10 Oh yeah, right, right.
01:02:11 I could talk about the politics of that, but I don't think any of you know, maybe Mesh
01:02:15 does a little bit.
01:02:16 Who are you voting for, Gil?
01:02:17 Are you voting Corbyn?
01:02:18 Are you going for Corbyn?
01:02:19 I'm going to wait until the manifesto is out, and I'm going to actually read it before
01:02:22 I decide.
01:02:24 Because Jeremy Corbyn, you know, he sounds pretty good compared to all the other candidates
01:02:30 that are out at the moment.
01:02:32 And in terms of like who could win, it's either Boris or Jeremy, most likely.
01:02:37 And I'd rather Jeremy just on the face of it because the Tories are...
01:02:42 There's lots of things that they do that I don't like.
01:02:45 And it's generally like the other party of the rich in a very broad sense.
01:02:51 They improve structural things in the, you know, they do things so that they can say
01:02:56 that they're improving like schools and hospitals and stuff.
01:02:59 But it's usually just like schools and hospitals in certain places that are already pretty
01:03:03 good and that they're sort of like letting lower money areas sort of turn to dust and
01:03:11 all the people die in the streets in a sense.
01:03:15 And you know, they'll get around to that in a while, but you know, that's how it seems
01:03:21 anyway.
01:03:22 I've been keeping up with the news and it seems like that's the Tory idea.
01:03:26 That's consistent with my impression of the Tory party and like Boris versus Jeremy.
01:03:33 I have the feeling that Jeremy is the better of the two, but I don't have a lot of knowledge
01:03:39 about it.
01:03:40 Yeah.
01:03:41 I mean, I don't know how good he's going to be at running the country.
01:03:44 All I know is that people hate him and the people who hate him are usually people, fat
01:03:49 old white men in suits.
01:03:50 So I have a feeling that he's a man of the people and the same people that hate Bernie.
01:03:54 Yeah.
01:03:55 Yeah.
01:03:56 It feels like that.
01:03:57 It feels like that.
01:03:58 But I need to read the manifesto.
01:03:59 And if I don't like it, I'm thinking I'll read the Lib Dem manifesto.
01:04:03 And if I don't like that, I don't know what I'm going to do because either the Tory party...
01:04:10 Are you not going to read Boris's manifesto?
01:04:11 Do they already have one or something?
01:04:13 In like a list, they will have one.
01:04:15 Like in the next few weeks, they're all going to have those.
01:04:17 I don't know how this works.
01:04:18 Like policy and all that.
01:04:20 Like I'm going to read the Labour one.
01:04:21 If I don't like it and I don't want to vote Labour, then I'm going to look into Lib Dem
01:04:26 and maybe vote Lib Dem.
01:04:27 If I don't like that, I might look at the Tory one.
01:04:30 And if I don't like all those, I guess I might just vote Brexit party because as much as
01:04:36 Nigel Farage is like a crazy evil man, probably a big racist, he is one of the only politicians
01:04:45 that is really like clear about his intentions.
01:04:48 And I was like...
01:04:49 Okay, but are they bad?
01:04:51 They sound bad.
01:04:52 Well, they're like a single party, right?
01:04:54 I mean, I really don't expect the Brexit party manifesto to be appealing to me.
01:04:59 It should be one fucking word, right?
01:05:01 Brexit.
01:05:02 Well, no, they got to have all like policies on schools and health and all that sort of
01:05:07 stuff.
01:05:08 But like in terms of Brexit being a good thing or a bad thing, I've heard so many conflicting
01:05:14 reports on whether it will be a good thing for the country or a bad thing for the country
01:05:17 from all types of people that I don't actually know whether I want it or I don't want it.
01:05:23 So voting Labour is like, there's going to be a referendum that they're going to do.
01:05:26 So the people will vote and I will just, I'll see then what I want to vote for.
01:05:32 Wait, what's the referendum for?
01:05:35 The referendum will be after the election.
01:05:37 Labour government say, if we win, we're going to have a referendum to put the Brexit to
01:05:42 the people after they've gotten a better deal than the one Boris Johnson has with the European
01:05:48 Union for leaving.
01:05:49 Do we already have a referendum on that?
01:05:51 It's not like the whole point Brexit's supposed to be happening.
01:05:53 I know.
01:05:54 There's been a lot of talk about like the people generally have changed their opinion and is
01:05:58 it right to go back and do it again without actually doing it in the first place and people
01:06:05 were misinformed before, people are going to be misinformed again.
01:06:08 It's like, it's a whole big fucking mess.
01:06:11 I think at this point, a referendum would be all right.
01:06:16 I don't think it would be a terrible abandonment of democracy because maybe the referendum
01:06:24 will show that people still want to leave and then it'll be like, okay, well, we're
01:06:29 leaving.
01:06:30 That's tricky business.
01:06:32 Did you guys hear about, Bernie tweeted about this.
01:06:38 The former president of Brazil was in jail and everyone says, everyone that I've talked
01:06:43 to says that he was like, they trumped up some corruption charges to get this guy in
01:06:49 jail, to get him out of the office so that they could elect their guy, Bolsonaro.
01:06:55 And Bolsonaro is like a far right fucking monster, apparently.
01:07:00 And I guess Lula, just the Supreme Court, just were like, yeah, we're actually going
01:07:05 to fix that.
01:07:06 So they got Lula out of jail.
01:07:07 Sorry, the Supreme Court of Brazil, I guess.
01:07:10 No, of America.
01:07:11 I don't know.
01:07:12 I was checking.
01:07:13 And Bernie tweeted about like, he's like, fuck yeah, Lula, you're my guy.
01:07:16 And Lula was like, Bernie, you're my guy too.
01:07:18 And I'm like, fuck yeah, dude, this fucking epic, I don't know.
01:07:25 I don't really know much about it other than that.
01:07:27 I just saw that Bernie was happy and I was happy too.
01:07:31 I see Bernie smile.
01:07:32 I hope it works out for everybody.
01:07:35 Yeah.
01:07:36 Hey, to your point though, Gib, at the very beginning of this, that worrying about the
01:07:42 meaning of life specifically is less cool and good to do generally than doing the work
01:07:48 and being a good boy and doing things.
01:07:50 Reminds me of the legendary Bestie Boy video, existentialism is a dangerous thing in which
01:07:55 I geniusly clipped Casey Neistat saying that existentialism is a dangerous thing.
01:08:00 Forget about it, get back to work.
01:08:03 So true.
01:08:04 Great clip boys.
01:08:05 Real editing shots, clip that on Twitch.
01:08:09 Clip that everybody.
01:08:10 Okay, that's all I have to say about that.
01:08:11 All right, let's get to these dang old voicemails over here.
01:08:15 Yes.
01:08:16 Let me see here.
01:08:17 Okay, as I said before, speak pipe, blah, blah, blah, you know the drill.
01:08:19 Okay, first one is of course from Hero of the People, racist Elmo calling back in.
01:08:26 Let's see what he has for us this time.
01:08:28 Go.
01:08:29 I'm gonna say it.
01:08:30 No, no, don't do it, Elmo.
01:08:32 I'm gonna say it.
01:08:33 No, Elmo.
01:08:34 I swear to God, please don't.
01:08:35 Please don't do it.
01:08:36 I don't know anything about it.
01:08:37 I'm gonna say it.
01:08:38 I'm gonna say the bad word.
01:08:41 Okay, Burmer.
01:08:45 Yeah.
01:08:46 That's it.
01:08:47 Yas, clean.
01:08:48 How could anyone find that offensive?
01:08:53 Have you guys heard about this?
01:08:54 Yes.
01:08:55 Burmer being a new slayer.
01:08:56 Yes, it's disgusting.
01:08:57 A new N-word for old people.
01:08:58 What?
01:08:59 What?
01:09:00 It's not acceptable.
01:09:01 It's like old people have heard about it and are now actually angry.
01:09:04 Some people are pushing for it to be considered hate speech, to call someone Burmer.
01:09:09 Did you guys see that New Zealand member of Congress who's like 25 or whatever, and while
01:09:14 she's giving a speech about how fucking what assholes all the Boomers are, like the real
01:09:18 Boomers, like someone's like heckling and she just goes, okay, Burmer, and then just
01:09:22 keeps going with her speech in fucking Parliament or whatever.
01:09:24 I didn't see it, but I heard about it pretty fine.
01:09:28 It was New Zealand Parliament.
01:09:29 New Zealand Parliament, you know, one of those funny states, one of those funny places.
01:09:33 It is really funny that they exist over there.
01:09:36 Absolutely true.
01:09:37 What do you think, Ben?
01:09:40 You're a Boomer.
01:09:41 You're old.
01:09:42 You're dead.
01:09:43 You know.
01:09:44 What do you think?
01:09:45 Well, I mean, obviously we shouldn't ban okay, Boomer, because Boomers are bad and we
01:09:50 should mock them all the time.
01:09:53 Right, of course.
01:09:54 Don't you find it a tad hypocritical that after surviving a decade of having millennial
01:09:58 be used as a backhanded term, as soon as it comes back to bite them in the ash look,
01:10:03 that's the new end word you can't say.
01:10:05 You can't call me that.
01:10:06 Obviously ridiculous.
01:10:07 You can't say mean.
01:10:08 You can't use that word.
01:10:09 That's our way.
01:10:10 I'm really curious who is pushing for this to be considered hate speech, because I think
01:10:18 people on Facebook are starting petitions or something like that.
01:10:21 Which obviously means nothing, but yeah.
01:10:23 Boomers do not even understand social politics.
01:10:26 Boomers are all over Facebook.
01:10:27 No, that's what I mean.
01:10:29 They wouldn't even understand that you could get something classified as hate speech.
01:10:33 Would they?
01:10:34 I'm not sure.
01:10:35 Probably at this point.
01:10:37 Yeah, I would think so.
01:10:39 I mean, my parents are Boomers.
01:10:42 Certainly they would understand the concept of, well, it's different between making a word
01:10:48 hate speech.
01:10:49 That's a political thing they'd probably understand, versus specifically banning it on Facebook.
01:10:53 That they might, I don't know.
01:10:55 I feel like this is such a strange, stupid idea, because boomer is...
01:11:00 Maybe they're probably just being blown out of proportion as an issue.
01:11:04 There's so many other words you could use.
01:11:06 They can't fucking hate speech all of them.
01:11:09 Okay, old man.
01:11:10 Okay, pensioner.
01:11:11 You can't hate speech all of us.
01:11:13 That's a challenge, sir.
01:11:15 Okay, creaky bones.
01:11:17 You could say all sorts of things.
01:11:20 Well, but this is the leg they're standing on, and it's caught on as a pinnacle of this
01:11:25 ageist side.
01:11:26 Okay, skeleton.
01:11:27 This oldist.
01:11:28 That one hurts, my creaky old bones.
01:11:31 Yeah, they just...
01:11:33 I mean, whatever.
01:11:34 It's obviously fucking retarded and ridiculous, but...
01:11:37 Dude, hate speech.
01:11:38 I mean, I don't like when people's ideas are dismissed based on their immutable characteristics,
01:11:42 such as age.
01:11:43 Well, but nobody says okay, boomer, to someone just because they're old.
01:11:47 They say it to them because they're acting like a boomer, and they're being stupid.
01:11:52 They're being stubborn and old-fashioned for no reason other than to be stubborn.
01:11:58 Don't you think that an accusation could be made is, let's say, of me in this group for
01:12:02 like, I like to plan things, I like to nitpick, and I'm like, I need details.
01:12:05 Is that me being a boomer?
01:12:07 Am I going to be okay boomered by...
01:12:09 Am I going to be Judas by one of this group?
01:12:11 You might be.
01:12:12 What's your point?
01:12:13 My point is...
01:12:14 You're not a boomer.
01:12:15 That's rude.
01:12:16 And I will destroy people who say things I don't like.
01:12:20 I am in the Teen CP fan group, and I am labeled cruelly a confirmed boomer.
01:12:25 Dude, you just got mocked day in, day out by those people who are not fair.
01:12:29 Just own the word.
01:12:30 Own the word.
01:12:31 Just say, yeah, I'm a boomer.
01:12:32 What of it?
01:12:33 Yeah.
01:12:34 Some day, Nate, we will be the boomers, and then we'll show these kids how it's done for
01:12:38 you.
01:12:39 We're millennials.
01:12:40 We'll be the boomers when we were dropping the fucking bombs on their communes, these
01:12:43 fucking zoomers.
01:12:44 We're already called boomers by the zoomers.
01:12:46 I mean, boomer is just a funny word anyway.
01:12:49 I wouldn't mind being called a boomer.
01:12:51 It's funny.
01:12:52 We're millennials though.
01:12:54 I know, but...
01:12:55 The words just change.
01:12:56 It's simply changed now.
01:12:57 It's bullshit because it's...
01:12:58 I don't like it because boomer is actually a bad thing.
01:13:03 But it referred to a specific group of people who are bad and should be oppressed with hateful
01:13:09 speech.
01:13:10 But it sucks that people joke that the fact that it's expanded just mean anyone.
01:13:16 The fact that I don't think it applies...
01:13:19 It's not that I'm thinking, oh, you shouldn't be able to say it to me.
01:13:21 I just really don't think it applies to me, but people use it for people like me.
01:13:25 So Ben, if I'm one of the good ones, then I'm not a boomer.
01:13:31 It's about a state of mind as opposed to a demograph.
01:13:33 You wouldn't say okay boomer to someone who's not acting in that shitty boomer way.
01:13:39 But I've seen so many people just call to boomer simply for being old and for no other
01:13:44 reason.
01:13:45 No, you're lying.
01:13:46 Okay, but listen.
01:13:47 There's people who get dismissed for having an anime icon on their Twitter.
01:13:52 It doesn't matter what.
01:13:53 You ban boomer, something else will crop up.
01:13:57 People will dismiss other people based on very superficial things.
01:14:00 It's stupid.
01:14:01 We'll share.
01:14:02 We can all agree on that.
01:14:03 The thing with boomer...
01:14:04 But I'm saying it's not superficial.
01:14:06 People don't say okay boomer for superficial reasons.
01:14:08 You say it when you're acting shitty.
01:14:09 When someone...
01:14:10 Anyone ever says it for superficial reasons.
01:14:12 It's great.
01:14:13 Believe them acting shitty.
01:14:14 They're disagreeing with whatever the other person is believing, so they're dismissing
01:14:19 them and their points by saying no.
01:14:21 Okay, but disagreeing with your ideas is not superficial.
01:14:24 It's not just because they're old.
01:14:26 That's what I'm saying.
01:14:27 It's not like the N-word, which is just something you can say to someone because they're black
01:14:32 and it is bad for that reason.
01:14:35 You don't use boomer in the same way.
01:14:36 Wait, I can say it because they're black?
01:14:37 Okay, I've got license to say that.
01:14:39 I'm loading my barrels, boys.
01:14:40 Here we go.
01:14:41 It's not like that at all.
01:14:44 That's my...
01:14:45 Okay, there you go.
01:14:46 It's definitely different.
01:14:47 Yeah.
01:14:48 All I'm going to say is, if someone ever calls me a boomer simply for being old in them,
01:14:51 I will say, my big brother said you're not allowed to say that to me.
01:14:55 That's really fucked up.
01:14:56 What are you talking about?
01:14:57 That's not what I said.
01:14:59 No?
01:15:00 Isn't that the point that it's about...
01:15:02 No, you got everything wrong.
01:15:03 ...the things you're saying?
01:15:04 Okay, what?
01:15:05 The point is that it's not just about age.
01:15:07 Aren't we agreeing on that?
01:15:08 Yeah, I'm saying, yeah, you can say it.
01:15:10 Yeah, you can say it.
01:15:11 Okay.
01:15:12 You can say it.
01:15:13 The point is that you don't just say it because someone's old.
01:15:16 Nobody fucking does that.
01:15:18 I was literally called a boomer in the Teen CP fan chat because I'm older than them because
01:15:23 I'm like 29.
01:15:24 But they didn't mean it.
01:15:25 That's it.
01:15:26 But they didn't mean it.
01:15:27 Oh, okay.
01:15:28 Oh, my man.
01:15:29 They didn't mean it.
01:15:30 They didn't mean it.
01:15:31 They didn't mean it.
01:15:32 They didn't mean what okay boomer means.
01:15:33 That's the problem.
01:15:34 They'll learn the word from meme sites and they won't know what the context is fully.
01:15:41 As the word gets circulated more and more, people will misunderstand its usage more and
01:15:44 more until it doesn't actually work as what it was initially intended to be.
01:15:50 Yep.
01:15:51 Oh, boy.
01:15:52 Nothing means anything.
01:15:53 It's just gonna be a phrase of dismissal of someone's point.
01:15:56 Well, sometimes it is.
01:15:57 No matter the reason.
01:15:58 Sometimes.
01:15:59 That's what it's gonna become.
01:16:00 Do we agree?
01:16:01 Yeah.
01:16:02 Do we agree?
01:16:03 Okay.
01:16:04 Okay.
01:16:05 Anyway.
01:16:06 Got another voicemail here.
01:16:07 Let's go.
01:16:08 Oh, shit.
01:16:09 All right.
01:16:10 Here we go.
01:16:11 This is how tanky is Ben.
01:16:14 Let's hear what he has to say.
01:16:15 All right.
01:16:16 Here we go.
01:16:17 Nate only likes musical mail.
01:16:19 So here's a voicemail as a song.
01:16:22 What are all of your hot takes on revolution in Hong Kong?
01:16:30 That's it.
01:16:31 Cool message.
01:16:33 See, short and sweet.
01:16:34 This is fun.
01:16:35 Good.
01:16:36 I've heard.
01:16:37 I've got no hot take.
01:16:38 I saw this fucking YouTube channel called Nathan Rich, who is this American expat living
01:16:43 in China, who sort of debunked a lot of the claims made by the Hong Kong protestors.
01:16:51 I can't remember exactly what it was about, but it was interesting that they're bound
01:16:54 to exaggerate as every side will.
01:16:56 That is like...
01:16:57 Nathan Rich.
01:16:58 Yeah.
01:16:59 I mean, he looks like an evil man, like a skinhead.
01:17:02 Oh, I don't like the look of this guy at all.
01:17:04 But there was a video that was like...
01:17:06 He was just looking at policy and like the reason for the thing in the...
01:17:10 I don't know.
01:17:11 I remember it being compelling.
01:17:13 It was a while since I actually looked at it.
01:17:16 But worth checking out just to see what argument there is against the protests.
01:17:24 Everybody's diesel position is going to be...
01:17:26 I've heard nothing of this position from anywhere because no, I don't follow Chinese
01:17:32 media at all.
01:17:33 So like, I don't know what they would think.
01:17:35 Look, even if Hong Kong turns out to be 100% right, everything China is doing is fucked
01:17:39 up.
01:17:40 Like, okay, that's fine.
01:17:41 But I have actually never heard China's argument.
01:17:44 I've only heard the Hong Kong argument and I'm just saying, I'm just, I'm a little bit
01:17:48 agnostic.
01:17:49 Seems to me probably this seems wrong, but you should definitely hear at least the argument
01:17:53 if it's just, no, we own you.
01:17:55 That's it.
01:17:56 We're going to do whatever we want.
01:17:57 Then I'm like, oh, okay.
01:17:58 Then I mean, that seems a little unfair.
01:17:59 Well, if they haven't said anything other than that, then I guess that's all they got.
01:18:03 I have paid no attention.
01:18:04 Well, maybe Nathan Richier will open my eyes to why China is a benevolent dictator.
01:18:09 The initial thing Hong Kong was built for was like a UK base of operations in case the
01:18:15 UK wanted to invade China.
01:18:17 They took the land from China.
01:18:19 They built it up and it became its own thing.
01:18:22 Then they had like, you know, you can't really have this said China and UK was like, yeah,
01:18:28 colonialism was kind of bad.
01:18:29 We're going to stop doing all that stuff.
01:18:31 So we're going to give it back to you.
01:18:33 Here's a contract for how this is going to happen.
01:18:35 And then the year came when that happened and it happened and it was just sort of like,
01:18:42 it's supposed to be to come back to China from what I understand.
01:18:47 So it's not like Britain is like, no, this actually still is ours.
01:18:51 It's that Hong Kong itself wants to be independent, which is fair enough.
01:18:56 But, you know, like I can definitely see that there is a lot of case on the Hong Kong side.
01:19:01 I'm not just suddenly saying, I saw this YouTuber and I'm like a big evil man now and I fully
01:19:06 support China.
01:19:07 Not true.
01:19:08 I just was interested to see that.
01:19:11 I mean, it's quite handy to have like a Chinese, like an English speaking man saying the Chinese
01:19:18 point of view.
01:19:19 That's otherwise I would never, I would never know.
01:19:22 Apparently, we all agree, fuck Hong Kong, which we're, you know, take it over China.
01:19:27 Apparently, one of the things that the protesters want is universal suffrage, which I guess
01:19:33 they don't have.
01:19:34 Oh, it's because like, I think if they were absorbed into China, I think that they would
01:19:38 lose the current like democratic system that they have.
01:19:41 And obviously they're kind of into that.
01:19:43 They want to maintain that.
01:19:45 It's hard to argue against that.
01:19:46 That seems like a pretty reasonable, you know.
01:19:48 I think the thing Nathan said was like in the contract, there was no guarantee of universal
01:19:54 suffrage to be given.
01:19:57 So like in any case, like it seems like the UK was just like, yeah, just fucking deal
01:20:03 with it.
01:20:04 And they left.
01:20:05 And Hong Kong was just like, they didn't like that.
01:20:07 They wanted more out of this deal and they're kind of getting fucked over.
01:20:12 It seems like China is scary.
01:20:16 China is scary.
01:20:17 It seems like China wants to do its like fucking like silencing of dissidents and journalists
01:20:24 and activists.
01:20:25 It sure does.
01:20:26 It wants to do that in Hong Kong.
01:20:28 And this is like part of what started the whole thing.
01:20:31 I mean, I linked a video, you know, maybe if we link like whatever, this guy, Nathan
01:20:35 Rich's video.
01:20:36 Okay, great.
01:20:37 I saw another video that was like way on the other side about like China.
01:20:41 Like I, when people say China is bad, I'm like, I believe that sounds reasonable.
01:20:45 I actually know like nothing about how China operates, but I watched one video fairly recently
01:20:49 and I was like, ooh, that's not so good, China, you really fucking over these boys.
01:20:55 That's not cool.
01:20:56 That's not cool.
01:20:57 Like if it comes down to it.
01:20:58 I forgot the specific link of video.
01:20:59 That's the word on the street.
01:21:00 That's the word on the street.
01:21:01 That's all we need to know.
01:21:02 Yeah.
01:21:03 I mean, when it comes down to it, I like underdogs.
01:21:06 So I'm generally in Hong Kong.
01:21:07 Oh my God.
01:21:08 Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China
01:21:14 would end in, quote, bodies smashed and bones ground into powder.
01:21:18 Yeah.
01:21:19 That is a quote from the President of China.
01:21:22 Maybe a red flag or two.
01:21:23 I don't know.
01:21:24 I don't know.
01:21:25 I don't want to jump to conclusions here, you know, it seems, there could be some explanation
01:21:32 here.
01:21:33 Oh yeah.
01:21:34 Was it bones ground to powder?
01:21:36 Jesus Christ.
01:21:37 Body smashed and bone.
01:21:38 Well, I don't want that.
01:21:39 So I guess I shouldn't support separatism.
01:21:41 You know, I like the cut of that man's jib.
01:21:44 Imagine a Winnie the Pooh smashing your body to pieces and grinding your bones to powder.
01:21:49 Isn't it funny?
01:21:50 To make these delicious honey pots.
01:21:51 Isn't it funny that Winnie the Pooh and the Chinese flag are the same colors?
01:21:54 Oh, very interesting indeed, Tom.
01:21:57 What a coincidence.
01:21:58 Wait, which flags?
01:21:59 The Chinese flag and Winnie the Pooh are the same color.
01:22:03 Same color scheme.
01:22:04 Hmm.
01:22:05 Well, I guess.
01:22:06 Did you ever see Winnie the Pooh's label?
01:22:07 Maybe it was made in China.
01:22:10 Oh.
01:22:11 Makes sense to me.
01:22:12 Okay.
01:22:13 I think I'm pro Hong Kong on this one.
01:22:16 I think I'm coming down on that side.
01:22:19 This guy, he asked for hot takes, so you've got two hot takes.
01:22:22 One, go Hong Kong and the second hot take.
01:22:25 Go China.
01:22:26 Fuck yeah.
01:22:27 Do it up, boys.
01:22:28 My hot take is see the two sides of the story at least.
01:22:31 That's my hot take.
01:22:32 We can please everyone.
01:22:33 We must.
01:22:34 They said it couldn't be done.
01:22:37 And they said bipartisanship was a myth.
01:22:39 All right.
01:22:40 Let's go on to the ghost of scumbag, Chris, is calling back once again.
01:22:45 Let's hear what he has to say.
01:22:46 Oh, wait, wait.
01:22:47 Last time he called him, he was just scumbag, Chris.
01:22:48 Now he's the ghost of scumbag, Chris.
01:22:50 I guess he killed himself.
01:22:51 Yes, he did.
01:22:53 Maybe he was in China a little bit too long.
01:22:54 Maybe he had his bones ground to powder.
01:22:57 We can only hope.
01:22:58 Maybe he killed himself like Epstein did.
01:23:00 Of course.
01:23:01 It all makes sense.
01:23:03 Now there's a story I can believe.
01:23:04 All right.
01:23:05 Let's play it.
01:23:06 Go on, Chris.
01:23:07 Take it away.
01:23:08 Yes.
01:23:09 You're a piece of shit.
01:23:10 Oh, shit.
01:23:11 I tried to make an emotionally poignant finale to the scumbag, Chris Trilogy.
01:23:19 You failed.
01:23:20 After you said to tell more of it, but my third voicemail was never played.
01:23:27 Quality always matters.
01:23:28 You were worthy in favor of some garbage about the dimensional murder.
01:23:33 Better start drinking from the cup, because this is the final straw.
01:23:39 Oh, shit.
01:23:40 Now my character arc has been cut unjustly short by your hand, and I wander the PC purgatory
01:23:49 as a vengeful spirit of vengeance.
01:23:53 Get your shit together.
01:23:56 Start taking better voicemails.
01:23:59 For next time you're on, get ready for a mouthful of ghosts.
01:24:06 Scary.
01:24:07 I guess a current example, not a good example of these better voicemails that you're helping
01:24:13 us to play.
01:24:14 Halloween's over.
01:24:15 Ghost of scumbag, Chris.
01:24:16 Get the fuck out of here.
01:24:17 This window was closed on this opportunity.
01:24:19 I like how I half-assed that voice was.
01:24:21 I know.
01:24:22 He didn't even put any stank on it, which I mean reverb.
01:24:25 That would be the way to make it easy ghost.
01:24:28 I think we've just seen an example of exactly why your character arc was cut tragically
01:24:33 short.
01:24:34 Scumbag, Chris.
01:24:35 Can't even do a little reverb.
01:24:36 That's not much to ask for, really.
01:24:40 It didn't need reverb.
01:24:42 I liked how shitty it was.
01:24:44 Really?
01:24:45 Scumbag to the bitter end.
01:24:46 Appreciate that, Chris.
01:24:48 Better luck next time, chief.
01:24:50 Okay, let's go.
01:24:51 We've got next up a humble request.
01:24:53 Okay.
01:24:54 Ready?
01:24:55 One, two, three, go.
01:24:56 Hi, guys.
01:24:57 Please consider uploading your shit to Spotify or updating your Google Drive more often,
01:25:03 because when I want to listen to the new PCP, there are usually two websites they use to
01:25:09 convert your video to an mp3, so I can listen to it on my phone, but sometimes it doesn't
01:25:15 work on the website for some reason.
01:25:17 So yeah, please do Spotify.
01:25:19 Spotify would make my life a million, a gazillion times easier.
01:25:25 I will pray.
01:25:27 Can we make money through Spotify?
01:25:30 Good question.
01:25:31 You can make money, but last I checked when I tried to get the podcast on Spotify, they
01:25:35 were not accepting podcast submissions at the time.
01:25:37 I don't know.
01:25:38 Well, shit.
01:25:39 Just call it an album.
01:25:41 I do grind my face against the whetstone that is the internet every week to get the podcast
01:25:48 up on iTunes, Google Play, and a bunch of other things.
01:25:51 It's just not on Spotify because Spotify is its own thing, and it's not on Stitcher
01:25:56 either.
01:25:57 Maybe that will change for a nominal fee.
01:26:01 Would that cost money to get it on Stitcher or something?
01:26:03 I don't know.
01:26:04 I'd have to look into it.
01:26:05 Okay, well, fair enough.
01:26:06 Is the Google Drive not up to date?
01:26:08 The drive is up to date.
01:26:09 The problem is, once it hits a certain amount of downloads, it stops working, and that happens
01:26:14 almost instantly.
01:26:15 Wait, what?
01:26:16 That's why I wanted to play.
01:26:17 What?
01:26:18 Yeah, that's right.
01:26:19 I wanted to link for a limited amount of times, which is why I keep saying, or I mentioned,
01:26:23 like last week, we should put the iTunes and Google podcast links in the description.
01:26:30 Which is exactly why I wanted to play this, because I think I did it for the last episode.
01:26:34 Did I?
01:26:35 Remember to do that?
01:26:36 I don't think you did.
01:26:37 Oops.
01:26:38 Well, okay.
01:26:39 We can go back and fix that, and we'll put it in the future.
01:26:41 We probably will stop linking the Google Drive one, especially because of this cap thing.
01:26:45 Like, what's the point?
01:26:46 It's not really very useful.
01:26:47 That's the worst.
01:26:48 Pretty good.
01:26:49 It is bad.
01:26:50 It is bad.
01:26:51 But if we give you people the fucking iTunes link, and whatever the other one you said,
01:26:53 I can't remember.
01:26:54 If they're there, then I mean, that's the better option, just to use those podcast things.
01:26:58 I don't know why we haven't been linking up to this point.
01:27:00 So from now on, I think look for those.
01:27:02 Those are better options overall.
01:27:03 You have 4.7 out of 5 stars on iTunes.
01:27:06 We're doing good.
01:27:07 Not bad.
01:27:08 Not bad.
01:27:09 That's quality.
01:27:10 That's quality.
01:27:11 Guys, I have news.
01:27:12 We sold a first loser of Fine Purpose November shirt.
01:27:16 Yeah.
01:27:17 He's the last loser.
01:27:18 Yes.
01:27:19 Show them out.
01:27:20 There's one loser.
01:27:21 Who is it?
01:27:22 I don't know who it was.
01:27:23 I want to know so bad.
01:27:24 Right into the show.
01:27:25 Leave us a voicemail.
01:27:26 Make it short because I won't play it.
01:27:27 Tweet yourself.
01:27:28 Take a picture of yourself in the mirror.
01:27:30 Please.
01:27:31 We need that picture and tweet as soon as you can.
01:27:33 I want to see it.
01:27:34 Well, I mean, I'm sure it's in the mail right now, but...
01:27:36 Well, okay.
01:27:37 But as soon as you can, as soon as you can.
01:27:38 We love those.
01:27:39 We love to see the merch and the pictures and whatnot.
01:27:40 Actually, it sold this morning.
01:27:42 To day.
01:27:43 Let me see.
01:27:44 To day.
01:27:45 The episode's been out like two or three days now, so, okay, that's not...
01:27:48 I guess it's not that weird.
01:27:49 That's not just right.
01:27:50 Okay.
01:27:51 Yeah.
01:27:52 Excellent.
01:27:53 Anyway, just wanted to let you all know that the system works.
01:27:54 It did.
01:27:55 It does.
01:27:56 And I just want to know so bad, who is the first loser of Fine Purpose November?
01:28:00 Who could it be?
01:28:01 And so far, the only one.
01:28:02 Who has found no purpose.
01:28:03 He's got the title and the crown.
01:28:05 I'm glad that everybody who is considering buying this shirt now will know it.
01:28:09 For them, it is a lie that they are not the first loser anymore.
01:28:13 That's true.
01:28:14 No, no, no.
01:28:15 To be fair, just because you bought the shirt, that doesn't mean that you, before this person,
01:28:20 didn't, in your own way, lose Fine Purpose November first.
01:28:24 At a minimum, you're going to need to buy the shirt to compete.
01:28:26 Yeah, yeah, buy the shirt.
01:28:27 So you really need to get on your game and buy the shirt already.
01:28:29 You don't lose Fine Purpose November by buying the shirt.
01:28:32 That's not what does it.
01:28:33 It's already a thing about you.
01:28:35 It's just a mark.
01:28:36 Wait.
01:28:37 It's like the mark of Cain.
01:28:38 How do you fail?
01:28:39 You have to not find a purpose in November.
01:28:43 You have to be certain that you will not find purpose.
01:28:45 I was the first loser.
01:28:46 You must have disqualified yourself from possibly finding purpose.
01:28:51 For the whole month.
01:28:52 Yes.
01:28:53 For the whole month.
01:28:54 That's right.
01:28:55 Demonstrating.
01:28:56 And that's up to you.
01:28:57 I'd love to hear the story of how that was done.
01:28:58 How did you lose Fine Purpose November?
01:29:00 For good.
01:29:01 Citizens.
01:29:02 Good.
01:29:03 Cool, cool.
01:29:04 All right.
01:29:05 Next voicemail, we've got, let me see.
01:29:06 This is Lil' Bobo Spitten Facts Freestyle.
01:29:09 Okay.
01:29:10 Are you ready for this?
01:29:11 Get ready for some straight facts from Lil' Bobo.
01:29:14 Okay.
01:29:15 Take it away.
01:29:16 More gay facts, please.
01:29:17 Yes.
01:29:18 Obscended it himself.
01:29:21 Good.
01:29:22 All right.
01:29:23 Nate is over in games.
01:29:25 No.
01:29:26 No.
01:29:27 Mages of female.
01:29:32 There it is.
01:29:35 Gibb is probably a creep in your life.
01:29:41 Ben is straight up writing fan fiction.
01:29:44 No, come on.
01:29:46 When you have bad taste in energy drinks.
01:29:50 I don't like, end it.
01:29:52 Cut it off.
01:29:53 And I love it.
01:29:54 There you go.
01:29:55 All right.
01:29:56 It's not fan fiction.
01:29:58 It's a social experiment.
01:30:01 It can be fan fiction if it's canonical.
01:30:05 Yeah, which it all is.
01:30:07 Yes, yes.
01:30:08 And it's also a fact, everybody.
01:30:10 That's right.
01:30:11 It's not fan fiction.
01:30:12 It's fan fact.
01:30:13 Perfect.
01:30:14 Put that on a fucking shirt.
01:30:16 That's genius.
01:30:17 What did he mean say, like, I'm probably a creep in real life?
01:30:21 No, notice how he couched that in, probably.
01:30:23 Those fucking wiggle words and shit.
01:30:25 I thought you were spitting facts, man.
01:30:27 Yeah, I mean, it's not a fact.
01:30:29 But also, like, on what basis is this made?
01:30:34 I don't know.
01:30:35 Who can say, man?
01:30:36 I don't like that.
01:30:37 I don't like this guy spitting at me.
01:30:40 That seems like a creepier thing to do than whatever you do.
01:30:43 Ooh, damn, true.
01:30:44 He's got to justify himself.
01:30:45 Yeah.
01:30:46 Defend your, debate us.
01:30:48 Debate us on stream power.
01:30:49 Call back in.
01:30:50 I want more freestyle defending your claims here.
01:30:52 Give us more hot free styles, dude.
01:30:54 The burden of proof is on you.
01:30:56 It's true.
01:30:57 It's very true.
01:30:58 Oh, those wiggle words.
01:31:00 Wiggle words.
01:31:01 Wiggle words.
01:31:02 Wiggle words.
01:31:03 No, no.
01:31:04 The wiggle words do not discuss me at all.
01:31:06 Please.
01:31:07 All right.
01:31:08 We've got one more voicemail.
01:31:10 Now, this is Mozilla Fennekin on voicemails.
01:31:14 He's got some information to deliver about voicemails.
01:31:16 So, let's give him a minute and 12 seconds to sue Diaz to say.
01:31:20 That's a lot.
01:31:21 Okay.
01:31:22 Take it away.
01:31:23 Take it away.
01:31:24 A piece of advice on how to get your voicemails played on the PCP from the actual god of voicemails.
01:31:29 The god of bad voicemails, that is.
01:31:32 If you have, like, a joke or a skit that you want to do, maybe just think about it for a day or two before actually submitting it.
01:31:40 You know, the whole reason why I did the human core thing is because I thought my answer of bathrooms was funny for, like, 30 minutes.
01:31:48 And so, when it came time for me to actually follow up on that, I didn't think it was funny, but I, you know, had to follow up on it.
01:31:57 I was fucking trapped.
01:31:59 So, I did it anyway.
01:32:00 And now I'm trapped here in this prison to rot forever!
01:32:05 Don't be like me.
01:32:07 Be funny.
01:32:08 Be creative.
01:32:09 Do something interesting like this.
01:32:15 Yes.
01:32:16 Amazing.
01:32:17 Oh, wow.
01:32:18 I'm supposed to be saying the n-word now!
01:32:25 You have been banned from the Mickey Mouse Club for inappropriate behavior.
01:32:32 You know, I was about to say, don't listen to this guy.
01:32:37 This is a bad email.
01:32:38 Right.
01:32:39 This is a bad voicemail, but he saved it.
01:32:41 He saved it at the end.
01:32:42 He saved it at the end.
01:32:43 He saved it at the end.
01:32:44 Good work.
01:32:45 What's the Mickey Mouse clip from?
01:32:46 I don't know, but I want to.
01:32:49 Sounds like the voice of Mickey Mouse himself.
01:32:51 That might have been him.
01:32:53 Maybe he's been calling in all along, pretending to be Mozilla Fenniken, but really he's been
01:32:57 Mickey Mouse.
01:32:58 Mickey Mouse sounds more like, hey.
01:33:03 Hey.
01:33:04 Hey.
01:33:05 Hey, it's happy days.
01:33:06 Happy days are yours.
01:33:07 Okay.
01:33:08 I'm going to get some of that Gabagool.
01:33:09 Goofy.
01:33:10 Hey.
01:33:11 I'm eating.
01:33:12 I'm walking my New York style pizza.
01:33:17 Where's Mickey from?
01:33:18 Is Mickey like from the deep south, you know?
01:33:20 He's from the south.
01:33:21 He's a rat.
01:33:22 He's a fucking rat.
01:33:24 Oh, dude.
01:33:25 Oh, fun, totally unrelated story.
01:33:28 I had close encounter with some rats yesterday.
01:33:31 Oh yeah?
01:33:32 Yeah.
01:33:32 You know, I did too at a taco stand.
01:33:34 We just saw a big delicious looking rat
01:33:35 run under the taco stand.
01:33:37 Delicious looking.
01:33:38 They were delicious looking.
01:33:38 Ooh, it was great.
01:33:39 Yeah, go on, what do you got?
01:33:40 I saw, I was out, we went to,
01:33:42 I was with Munchie, Kazi,
01:33:44 and Kibun and Fat Yoshi from RFCK.
01:33:47 And we went out to a Boba Tea place
01:33:50 and I was standing outside
01:33:51 and I looked at the trash can
01:33:52 and these two rats,
01:33:53 one rat just crawled up the trash can
01:33:55 and I realized there was a second rat already there
01:33:57 and the two of them just like hung their heads
01:33:59 over the lip of it,
01:34:00 looking into the trash can
01:34:01 and then someone walked by and they scattered.
01:34:02 And then I was like, hey guys, check it out.
01:34:04 I saw some rats in this trash can
01:34:06 and they all went up to the trash can
01:34:07 and then like more rats like exploded out of it
01:34:10 and they all like fled.
01:34:12 They all like started running
01:34:13 and screaming down the street.
01:34:15 And I was like, what are you guys so worried about?
01:34:16 It's just rats.
01:34:17 They're just mice but big.
01:34:19 These are my people.
01:34:20 Do not be afraid.
01:34:21 Embrace them as you do me.
01:34:22 They were fine, they were cute.
01:34:23 I liked them.
01:34:24 Rats are cute.
01:34:24 I love rats.
01:34:25 Yeah, they were okay.
01:34:26 Yeah, the rat bit the taco stand was pretty cute.
01:34:27 He was a good boy.
01:34:28 Rats are smart and cute and I love them.
01:34:31 I've seen the rats of Nim.
01:34:32 They're as smart as human beings, as I understand it,
01:34:36 if not smarter.
01:34:37 It's crowd-pleasing.
01:34:38 Because they know there's free food in those trash cans.
01:34:40 They're not wasting time earning it to buy it.
01:34:42 They live off the teat
01:34:44 as any wise individual would do.
01:34:46 Yeah, I agree.
01:34:47 I'm with it.
01:34:48 There you go.
01:34:49 Oh, there might be.
01:34:49 No, no, no, wait.
01:34:50 Hold on.
01:34:51 Rat idea.
01:34:52 I just remembered.
01:34:53 Rat idea, yeah.
01:34:55 Okay.
01:34:56 I've seen a rat recently, too.
01:34:58 Well, not too recently,
01:34:59 but the last time I was in Burger King,
01:35:01 I think that was like a while ago.
01:35:03 Oh, no.
01:35:04 We were just eating burgers, me and Byter,
01:35:06 and I looked out the window
01:35:08 and we saw a little rat scurry away
01:35:11 with a little packet of ketchup in its mouth.
01:35:13 Aw, that's cute.
01:35:16 A feast for a king.
01:35:18 That's pretty cute.
01:35:19 You know, this whole equal distribution
01:35:21 of resources thing,
01:35:22 like I can get aboard with it to the human student degree,
01:35:24 but what about the animals?
01:35:25 We gotta distribute our resources to the rats
01:35:27 and the pigs and the cows and the chickens.
01:35:29 No, we have to exclude someone, and I think they're it.
01:35:33 We all know that human nature requires an underclass
01:35:36 to step on it and make it feel worse than us.
01:35:38 A certain baseline level of bigotry,
01:35:40 and I think we found our marks, ladies and gentlemen.
01:35:44 I think we've done it, blue girls.
01:35:45 Mouses.
01:35:47 Hashtag animal racism, we're doing it.
01:35:49 Yes.
01:35:50 All right, thanks for being here.
01:35:51 Hey, thanks for all the voicemails, everybody.
01:35:53 Appreciate those, those are good.
01:35:55 Leave more at the Speakpike link in the description,
01:35:57 and give us money for all the hard work we do here
01:35:59 on the show at patreon.com slash PCP.
01:36:02 Wait, the procrastiners, yeah, you know the one.
01:36:05 Link below.
01:36:06 Yeah, what's up?
01:36:07 Mouse, mice, rat, rice, really makes you think.
01:36:13 Really makes you think.
01:36:14 Chinese, really gets the old ticker tickin' away,
01:36:18 if you know what I'm sayin'.
01:36:20 Twitter.com slash P, what is it?
01:36:22 The procrastinators, I'm fuckin' it all up today.
01:36:24 Yeah, yeah, you know, we do things there,
01:36:27 updates and whatnot, follow us there, information, et cetera.
01:36:30 And anything else, buy t-shirts.
01:36:33 Find no purpose in November,
01:36:35 and prove it by buying a fat ass t-shirt
01:36:37 for your fat ass body.
01:36:39 I recommend the whole neck.
01:36:42 There you go, there you go.
01:36:43 And I guess that's all there is to say about that.
01:36:46 Let's keep it short, you know, why drag it out
01:36:48 like the Jepstein murder investigation?
01:36:50 No, no, no, just call it quits right here, folks.
01:36:52 Let's just wrap this thing up and send it down the Y.
01:36:55 Why drag it out like a fucking protest?
01:36:57 Like, for fuck's sake, what happened to protocol?
01:36:59 For Hong Kong, just submit, just submit already.
01:37:01 Like quit makin' a ruckus, okay?
01:37:03 Yeah, yeah, we got trades to make,
01:37:06 we got Bitcoin to invest in,
01:37:08 I don't have time for this human capital stuff
01:37:10 to worry about.
01:37:11 Hell yeah.
01:37:11 The capital I care about is Cincinnati?
01:37:15 The capital of Ohio where I live?
01:37:17 Yeah, there you go.
01:37:17 Why riot, why riot, why riot for suffrage
01:37:21 when you can just vote to get it?
01:37:23 Oh, wait, whoops.
01:37:25 That's what I thought.
01:37:26 All right, we'll see you next week, everybody.
01:37:27 Have a good week.
01:37:29 Bye.
01:37:30 Peace out, bye.
01:37:31 Nerd, bye-bye.
