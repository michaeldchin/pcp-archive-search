00:00:00 Let's go!
00:00:04 Let's go! That's it, that's the start.
00:00:07 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:10 We got me, Ben Saint, we got Gibbontake back from wherever the fuck,
00:00:16 and we got our special guest, Oblivionfall, who I'm sure most of you know.
00:00:23 Welcome to the show, OF.
00:00:28 Yeah, jeep.
00:00:30 How you, how you done? How you, how you living?
00:00:34 Half dead, as usual. Working myself to the grave every day, except this weekend I finally took a break and played Minecraft.
00:00:44 That's good.
00:00:46 Would you, would you like to introduce yourself to anyone who doesn't, who isn't familiar with your, with your uvra?
00:00:53 Oh my god. I've been like, I've been PCP adjacent for like almost seven years, I guess,
00:01:01 and I don't even think anyone was aware until very recently.
00:01:05 Like, oh jeez, like I saw it, I've been, oh man.
00:01:10 Wait, the PCP hasn't been around for seven years, hasn't it?
00:01:12 I know, like this goes back to the,
00:01:14 Maybe if you count, if you count like pre-PCP stuff.
00:01:16 This goes back to the pony days, like I remember watching Tommy Oliver, Anthony C, Cantalot Wedding Review,
00:01:22 like way back, and there's been a whole, there's been a whole bunch of characters who I have heard mentioned in your circle,
00:01:29 or even on the PCP every so often, it's like, oh hey, I live compostable a lot.
00:01:34 Lamal, or you know, FNGR, Keyframe, you know, Misanthropony, et cetera.
00:01:39 And like, I've been around those people.
00:01:42 These shadowy figures from the Misty Pat.
00:01:44 Oh, were you, were you ever in the Rift Cafe?
00:01:49 No, luckily, I don't think I ever was.
00:01:51 However, a lot of people...
00:01:52 You missed out on a real part.
00:01:54 I had a lot of friends in there, though, and a lot of them spoke to you guys,
00:01:57 and I'm like, man, I'd like to talk to you guys.
00:02:00 Why do all my friends talk to you, but I don't talk to you?
00:02:02 And that's how it was for years.
00:02:04 It's impossible, it's impossible.
00:02:06 I'm very hard to reach emotionally.
00:02:08 Yeah, either, there's two ways to get in contact with us.
00:02:10 Either be like a terrible, my little pony reviewer, Sokara 2014,
00:02:16 or be an incredible god of other worldly ability,
00:02:21 and then put, like, references to our things in animations and videos you make.
00:02:27 Right, right, that's the only other way to do it.
00:02:30 That's the only other way, and I found it.
00:02:32 I uncovered it myself.
00:02:34 You put, right, you had, you had a voicemail.
00:02:38 What was the song about cum?
00:02:40 What's the song about cum?
00:02:42 Your cum won't last, the sequel to the cum zone, I think.
00:02:46 Oh no, there was another one, there was a third.
00:02:48 They were free, they were free.
00:02:50 The cum zone is not even like, actually, maybe it's the first one.
00:02:53 No, I put PCP references in a couple of DA games music videos.
00:02:58 They're a channel with like a million sub scuba divers who,
00:03:02 they got popular doing like FNAF songs and let's plays and stuff,
00:03:07 and they branched out to a whole bunch of other like nerd core stuff,
00:03:11 and I was friends with that guy since he had like 200 subscribers,
00:03:15 and so when I was leaving the pony fandom,
00:03:19 when that, you know, collapsed and I'm like, I gotta escape in 2016,
00:03:24 they hired me on to make some music videos,
00:03:26 and I put PCP references in a few, in a few of those,
00:03:30 and then I made the cum zone, which is all PCP stuff all the way through,
00:03:35 like you see the broth, you see the fucking clannad crab with testicles in there,
00:03:40 a whole bunch of things.
00:03:42 So many people have seen those two videos,
00:03:45 probably more than have ever, ever watched like all of PCP videos combined.
00:03:52 Oh, maybe.
00:03:54 Yeah.
00:03:55 Like some, I think when it comes to video games videos, there's the Tattletail song,
00:03:59 which there's like a computer-y like glitchy part,
00:04:02 and there's like a little, I put a bunch of code on screen,
00:04:05 I just googled some code and had it scroll past,
00:04:07 and hidden in the code, like in the corners,
00:04:09 a bunch of like PCP references, that was one.
00:04:12 Then I did the Brothers in Arms Cuphead animation,
00:04:15 where I put an entire section dedicated to Gibbons,
00:04:19 Hippo tries not to die from skeletons, I put that in there,
00:04:22 and that's got like 60 million views now, I didn't even realize.
00:04:26 Whoa, whoa, whoa, 60 million, okay, oh fuck.
00:04:30 65 million.
00:04:31 I thought it was like five or six million.
00:04:33 It's so cool, and I think you had like a,
00:04:36 like how you animated the Hippo on your channel.
00:04:39 A little time lapse.
00:04:40 I think that same channel, and because people saw the DA,
00:04:43 not that same channel, your own after dark or something.
00:04:46 Yeah, my own channel.
00:04:47 Yeah, so my main channel is lesser than my after dark actually these days.
00:04:51 And like people saw the DA games thing,
00:04:54 they saw you had like animated in it,
00:04:58 somehow they found the Hippo thing,
00:05:00 then they went from that to the video that you linked
00:05:04 of me making my game, and then to the Itchio thing.
00:05:07 And I think I may have got one whole sale
00:05:09 from those 60 million people.
00:05:13 That's epic.
00:05:16 It system works.
00:05:18 The game wasn't free?
00:05:20 It was free, but you could pay for it if you wanted.
00:05:24 I think I definitely got a few downloads.
00:05:26 I don't think actually anyone paid for it, but you know, exposure.
00:05:31 That's okay.
00:05:32 That's okay.
00:05:33 Yeah, it's about reaching people at the end of the day.
00:05:36 Yeah.
00:05:37 It's about getting those eyeballs.
00:05:38 The only other big DA games video was the Baldi's Basics song,
00:05:43 which is very funny.
00:05:45 It's a very silly song.
00:05:46 I actually wrote the synth solo.
00:05:48 I did some music for it.
00:05:50 Why have I been hearing about Baldi's Basics?
00:05:54 It has just the past couple of weeks.
00:05:56 I've heard about it a bunch of times, and I've never heard about it before.
00:05:59 Oh, it's weird.
00:06:00 It lost relevancy like a year ago.
00:06:02 Maybe there's a DLC or something coming out.
00:06:05 I haven't kept up with it.
00:06:06 But in that video, there's a whole bunch of posters on the wall,
00:06:10 and all of them are PCP references.
00:06:12 Some of them really obscure.
00:06:14 Mysterious Rhinoceros even makes an appearance on one of those.
00:06:19 That secret channel.
00:06:20 Oh my god.
00:06:21 Imagine that.
00:06:23 Wow.
00:06:25 That's a deep cut.
00:06:26 Yeah.
00:06:28 Let's just fuck all this bullshit.
00:06:31 Let's just talk about the pony days.
00:06:33 Those are the good old days.
00:06:34 Let's just reminisce about the good times.
00:06:37 Do you remember Ben being in the Rift Cafe Skype group,
00:06:41 and then every few hours,
00:06:46 they'd have a call in which they played Cards Against Humanity,
00:06:50 and that was it.
00:06:52 That's all they did.
00:06:53 Yeah.
00:06:54 I remember Cards Against Humanity.
00:06:57 What a fucking shitty game.
00:07:00 For assholes.
00:07:02 I don't know.
00:07:03 Yikes.
00:07:04 I might have played once, just as a meme.
00:07:06 I definitely played a couple of times,
00:07:08 because it's like, I don't know how cool I am yet.
00:07:10 I'm just some guy just like one of the rest of these people.
00:07:13 I didn't realize that they were even worse than me.
00:07:17 I mean, you gotta do something, right?
00:07:20 Yeah, it's funny.
00:07:22 It's funny in hindsight.
00:07:24 Card games.
00:07:26 Very cool.
00:07:27 For very cool people.
00:07:28 The Rift Cafe was...
00:07:31 I got an argument there a lot.
00:07:33 I had beef with a couple of people.
00:07:38 Oh, I remember what I was going to say.
00:07:40 I had this idea.
00:07:41 Did you see what Mage did recently?
00:07:44 She made a Vtuber avatar?
00:07:46 Yeah.
00:07:48 She made a Vtuber puppet
00:07:50 and rigged it up and did a stream with it.
00:07:56 It was a little glitchy, but it mostly worked, as intended.
00:08:01 I gotta say, I asked her about it.
00:08:03 I asked her how she did it, what program she used.
00:08:05 She told me, I am very tempted to try it.
00:08:07 I'm very tempted to make a phantom horn.
00:08:13 Continue T-Bat plays or something?
00:08:15 I don't know.
00:08:16 I don't know what I would do with it.
00:08:19 It just seems fun.
00:08:20 It seems like a fun thing to make.
00:08:22 It does.
00:08:23 It's just sort of like...
00:08:25 There's multiple ways to do it.
00:08:27 I know the way you're supposed to do it, there's the program.
00:08:29 I think I downloaded it.
00:08:31 I just never got around to looking at the tutorials of how.
00:08:36 I'm like, whatever.
00:08:37 I guess I can figure that out eventually, and I never will.
00:08:41 I'm in the same place with Live2D.
00:08:43 I assume that's the program you had.
00:08:46 Yeah, yeah.
00:08:47 Yeah, FaceRig and Live2D, right?
00:08:49 Yeah, FaceRig, that's the other one.
00:08:51 I'm too lazy.
00:08:52 I don't like tutorials.
00:08:53 They suck.
00:08:54 I have too much other shit I should be doing
00:08:57 to even think about doing it right now.
00:09:00 If I had nothing on my plate, I might start fucking around in it
00:09:03 and see what I could cook up.
00:09:06 I mean, there's always something on your plate.
00:09:08 It doesn't matter how non-busy you try to be.
00:09:11 There's always going to be something more important
00:09:13 than making a puppet for live streams,
00:09:16 unless that's your career goal.
00:09:20 It's just a bit of fun.
00:09:22 It's always going to be less important than something.
00:09:25 My career goals are whatever I fucking want them to be.
00:09:28 If I want that to be what I'm doing, it will.
00:09:33 This doesn't make any sense now that I'm thinking about it,
00:09:36 but you should do gummy worm live streams,
00:09:39 creating gummy worms live and have phantom horn
00:09:44 matched to your movements somehow.
00:09:48 It doesn't make any sense because you need to.
00:09:51 What the fuck?
00:09:52 I don't know.
00:09:53 I just thought two things Ben St. does
00:09:55 and put phantom horn there.
00:09:57 It would be like footage of me cooking in the kitchen
00:10:01 with a little phantom horn in the corner
00:10:03 commentating on it or something.
00:10:07 You pre-record you making gummy worms
00:10:10 and then you webcam yourself as phantom horn,
00:10:14 stream the video and commentate on it
00:10:17 and say, what an idiot, what a stupid piece of shit.
00:10:20 Talk about what a piece of shit, garbage.
00:10:22 I am going to make a worm cooking video soon.
00:10:26 I think I complained last episode that it's actually,
00:10:30 I thought I was going to get great deals from China
00:10:32 on isomaltoligosaccharides,
00:10:34 but it's turned out to be a nightmare
00:10:36 and much more difficult than I thought.
00:10:38 And not even much cheaper,
00:10:40 actually more expensive than just buying them domestically.
00:10:42 I'm so mad.
00:10:43 I'm so mad that they don't just sell them
00:10:45 through fiber yam like they used to.
00:10:47 What a fucking joke.
00:10:48 Wait, phantom horn reacts.
00:10:51 You just do phantom horn reacts videos.
00:10:54 I got to pivot back to the pony days.
00:10:57 Just go back to being a full time pony tuber,
00:10:59 but this time with a V-tuber, a P-tuber if you will.
00:11:03 Yeah, like live reacting to my little pony episode.
00:11:06 The world's first P-tuber?
00:11:07 Dude, you have to react to your own T-Bap episodes.
00:11:10 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:11:12 Me and Tom keep saying that we're going to make,
00:11:15 we're going to do bonus episodes
00:11:17 that are us reacting to old PCP episodes,
00:11:20 like doing commentary tracks over them.
00:11:22 Oh my God.
00:11:23 We haven't done it yet.
00:11:24 It sounds like a clusterfuck, but I want it.
00:11:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:11:29 And it would be so hard to determine
00:11:33 whether the person talking,
00:11:35 to differentiate between present us talking about it
00:11:39 and past us talking,
00:11:41 it would be these two identical sets of voices
00:11:44 like randomly cutting in and out
00:11:46 and interrupting one another
00:11:47 and commenting on what each other is saying.
00:11:49 I think we should do one of those.
00:11:51 We should definitely try.
00:11:52 I definitely think our voices will have changed a bit.
00:11:56 Mine, I feel like, would have been a lot meeker, at least.
00:12:01 And I'd be like,
00:12:02 oh God, did I sound like that?
00:12:04 And you'd be like, yes.
00:12:05 Maybe.
00:12:06 Yeah.
00:12:07 Well, that would be just the kind of thing
00:12:09 I would want to hear, you know,
00:12:11 us notice about an old episode.
00:12:14 Did I really used to say that?
00:12:17 Did I really sound like that, whatever?
00:12:19 Funny.
00:12:20 I like it.
00:12:21 We'll do it.
00:12:22 We'll make it happen.
00:12:24 You guys want to talk about current events?
00:12:28 Yeah.
00:12:30 Minecraft, I guess.
00:12:31 That's the current event that I'm interested in.
00:12:33 Minecraft has been...
00:12:35 Minecraft Steve is announced for Smash, first of all,
00:12:39 which was epic,
00:12:41 and I really like the game explanation Sakura did.
00:12:46 I didn't watch the full thing.
00:12:48 I watched some of it.
00:12:50 I think that it looks...
00:12:51 I didn't care at first,
00:12:52 but then I saw how he plays and I thought,
00:12:54 oh wow, that's really neat.
00:12:55 That's funny.
00:12:56 The idea of like randomly,
00:12:57 like at any moment placing blocks
00:12:59 that you have in your inventory
00:13:00 and to the stage to like block people's attacks
00:13:03 and then jumping away.
00:13:04 Yeah.
00:13:05 It looks so cool if you could get really good at Steve.
00:13:08 Like that would make great footage.
00:13:10 And like mining for materials
00:13:12 and like what materials you dig up
00:13:14 determine like the quality of the weapons you make.
00:13:16 Like that's so good.
00:13:17 Yeah.
00:13:18 That's super good.
00:13:19 Such a gimmicky character.
00:13:20 Yeah.
00:13:21 He got a mind for diamonds.
00:13:22 Yeah.
00:13:23 But yeah, it's like the first time...
00:13:25 I don't even play Smash
00:13:26 and I'm kind of excited about it.
00:13:27 Yeah.
00:13:28 The first time I had even considered like,
00:13:30 maybe I should get in on this like Nintendo Switch thing
00:13:34 I've been hearing about, you know,
00:13:36 so it's a little new.
00:13:37 Really?
00:13:38 I still haven't bought one.
00:13:39 You weren't tempted by animal crossing?
00:13:42 I don't care about animal crossing.
00:13:44 I've never played one.
00:13:45 They seem fun and nice and wholesome,
00:13:48 but it's like...
00:13:49 You didn't see like everybody animal crossing,
00:13:51 posting on the all across the internet
00:13:53 and be like, shit, this is a cultural event
00:13:55 that I got that I don't...
00:13:56 All right.
00:13:57 Here's my gamer thought.
00:14:00 I hate cultural events
00:14:02 and I hate games that are like destined
00:14:04 to become irrelevant at some point.
00:14:06 Any multiplayer game
00:14:08 that has like seasons,
00:14:10 like season one of like Fortnite,
00:14:13 I hate feeling like the idea of like,
00:14:17 if I don't get in now,
00:14:18 I'll have missed out on all of the cool cosmetic stuff.
00:14:20 You can only get in season one
00:14:22 and then season two and season three.
00:14:24 And it's like, I hate that.
00:14:26 I hate it so much.
00:14:27 It pisses me off to see that even.
00:14:29 So I avoid anything that is like,
00:14:32 designed to be like,
00:14:34 to catch you in like perpetually playing the game.
00:14:38 Not because it's good,
00:14:39 but because you're scared of missing out on all the shit.
00:14:42 Yeah.
00:14:43 I had played an animal crossing before.
00:14:46 So I did not anticipate the degree to which
00:14:49 new horizons would be like,
00:14:52 that thing you just described.
00:14:54 It was like, yeah,
00:14:55 I have fallen off it partly because it's like,
00:14:58 I'm not interested in playing it forever, you know?
00:15:01 And I don't,
00:15:02 I'm not interested in keeping up with the,
00:15:04 you know, yeah, the new,
00:15:05 like holiday expansion packs and so forth.
00:15:08 I mean, I get that it, you know,
00:15:10 it's smart business because it works
00:15:12 and people are constantly manipulated easily
00:15:14 by it all the time.
00:15:16 It's just, I,
00:15:18 I grew up on games where you play them
00:15:20 and then you go back to them if you feel like it,
00:15:22 not because you feel compelled to be part of the event.
00:15:26 Yeah.
00:15:27 It's like, it's kind of why I like,
00:15:29 stopped playing Pokemon Go because I missed a bunch of things.
00:15:31 I was just going to say the same thing.
00:15:33 I was just going to say the same thing.
00:15:34 Yeah.
00:15:35 Like once, like the,
00:15:36 they keep releasing new updates for it.
00:15:37 I've missed the last few and I'm like,
00:15:39 at first I was like, yeah,
00:15:40 I want to be like,
00:15:41 I want to get lots of Pokemon
00:15:43 and make them really powerful and be like,
00:15:45 a fucking Pokemon master.
00:15:47 But then like the fact,
00:15:48 it's like World of Warcraft,
00:15:49 like the fact that new updates keep coming out,
00:15:51 they keep rendering the old stuff obsolete,
00:15:53 you know, the CP cap keeps rising.
00:15:55 It's like, eh, the grind will never end.
00:15:58 God, that's why,
00:15:59 that's why World of Warcraft Classic is so fucking good
00:16:01 because it's all going to stay exactly the same.
00:16:04 That's the whole point.
00:16:06 You can just play it
00:16:08 and you can see all of the stuff that used to be there
00:16:10 that they destroyed horribly.
00:16:12 How big the shoulder pads are.
00:16:14 Oh my God.
00:16:15 That's what I think of Warcraft.
00:16:17 World of Warcraft,
00:16:18 shoulder pads used to look like,
00:16:20 they've always been chunky and big,
00:16:22 but newer designs are like,
00:16:24 spikier and smaller details
00:16:26 that you can't really see from a distance.
00:16:28 The early like,
00:16:29 classic ones were like really big,
00:16:31 chunky,
00:16:32 like, you know,
00:16:33 chocolate bar shoulder pads.
00:16:34 You just,
00:16:35 you want to bite into them.
00:16:37 You want to,
00:16:38 you want to have a little Lego figurine
00:16:39 of your Warcraft character.
00:16:40 Now it's like,
00:16:41 I don't know,
00:16:42 stupid and socks.
00:16:44 It's old, good, new bed.
00:16:46 That's what it's always been.
00:16:48 I've already had this rent before on the PCPs.
00:16:50 I don't need to say it again.
00:16:52 That's why we have,
00:16:54 that's why I got to go back to the pony days
00:16:56 and become a P-Tuber again.
00:16:58 P-Tuber?
00:16:59 If only I'd had,
00:17:01 if only I'd had face rig back in 20, whatever,
00:17:04 when T-Bap was happening.
00:17:05 Things would have been different, I tell you.
00:17:07 That's going to put me out of business,
00:17:09 though, with my commission model that I do
00:17:11 for these pony YouTubers,
00:17:14 pony in the corner people.
00:17:16 Oh, oh right.
00:17:18 Do you still do those?
00:17:19 I do.
00:17:20 Do people still want those?
00:17:21 Yeah, every so often I get a message
00:17:23 from people being like,
00:17:24 hey, can you make vectors of my OC?
00:17:26 And I'm like, sure,
00:17:27 give me a million dollars,
00:17:29 and they do,
00:17:30 and it's cool.
00:17:31 Ponies specifically,
00:17:32 or just like anything?
00:17:33 It's all ponies.
00:17:34 Okay, so,
00:17:35 oh my God,
00:17:36 this goes back a little bit,
00:17:39 I guess it's tangentially related,
00:17:41 so people obviously
00:17:43 want their character to look show style,
00:17:45 because oh my God,
00:17:46 it looks official.
00:17:47 How embarrassing would it be
00:17:48 if your pony OC was like off model or style?
00:17:50 Yeah, imagine having a unique art style, cringe.
00:17:53 But, yeah,
00:17:55 so this goes back to,
00:17:57 I think, 2013.
00:17:58 There were leaks,
00:17:59 a bunch of animation files got leaked from DHX.
00:18:03 I remember this.
00:18:05 It turned out,
00:18:06 I actually had the leaks before they were public,
00:18:08 because I was working on a project
00:18:10 with a guy who I won't name
00:18:12 for the sake of his,
00:18:13 I don't know,
00:18:14 I don't want him to get in trouble.
00:18:15 He works at Warner Brothers.
00:18:16 He's a big boy there now, apparently.
00:18:18 Let's just call him Pro Jared.
00:18:20 Yeah, Pro Jared.
00:18:21 So,
00:18:22 Pro Jared approached me in early 2013
00:18:24 to work on a project for free.
00:18:26 Oh my God, epic.
00:18:28 And he gave me some...
00:18:29 For exposure?
00:18:30 Yeah, exactly.
00:18:31 No, terrible.
00:18:32 He gave me some files,
00:18:33 and he's like,
00:18:34 don't show these to anyone.
00:18:35 And I'm like,
00:18:36 oh, I assume these belong to your old animator.
00:18:38 Then the leaks happened,
00:18:39 and it turned out they were official rigs
00:18:41 from fucking DHX,
00:18:43 and I'm like, oh, fuck.
00:18:45 But from there,
00:18:46 I studied them,
00:18:47 and I created my own rigs in their likeness.
00:18:49 I basically just traced over every single piece,
00:18:51 one by one,
00:18:52 and made it my own.
00:18:54 So technically not stealing.
00:18:56 And...
00:18:57 You just traced them exactly.
00:18:58 Yeah, traced.
00:18:59 Pixel, pixel perfect.
00:19:00 Yeah, and people got mad at me for like,
00:19:01 how dare you do that?
00:19:02 That's the same as using them.
00:19:03 Use our rigs where we traced it instead,
00:19:05 and I'm like,
00:19:06 they did the same thing.
00:19:08 I mean, I agree with them,
00:19:10 but for the opposite reason,
00:19:11 like, I do agree, like,
00:19:13 why do that?
00:19:14 Like, what's the point?
00:19:15 Like, if you're just going to copy them exactly,
00:19:17 what's the point in not using them?
00:19:19 I changed up the design slightly,
00:19:20 and made improvements to it,
00:19:21 but from there,
00:19:23 I have this animation rig,
00:19:24 and I'm like, hey,
00:19:25 I could just pose this character
00:19:27 a bunch of times in flash,
00:19:28 and render an image sequence.
00:19:30 Why don't I do that
00:19:31 for people who make, like, analysis videos?
00:19:33 And I did it for a friend who, for free,
00:19:35 to just start off with.
00:19:37 And then a bunch of air friends were like,
00:19:38 oh, do mine, do mine next,
00:19:39 do mine next.
00:19:40 And I'm like, okay.
00:19:41 And then I did it for free the first few times,
00:19:43 and then I thought, wait,
00:19:44 what if I, like,
00:19:45 what if people pay money for work?
00:19:48 What's that?
00:19:49 So I'm like, sure,
00:19:51 I'll make you, like, a hundred images
00:19:52 for $1 each,
00:19:54 but all I really have to do
00:19:55 is just make the image once,
00:19:57 and it automatically completes for rest.
00:19:59 And so I have done
00:20:01 over 40,000 vectors
00:20:04 in the last few years.
00:20:06 And it's going up,
00:20:08 because every character,
00:20:09 it's now 150 per character.
00:20:11 Do you, do you have, like,
00:20:13 do you have, like, an algorithm
00:20:14 where it's like, you make the rig,
00:20:16 and then, like, you run it through an algorithm
00:20:18 that creates, like,
00:20:19 vectors in different expressions,
00:20:20 or whatever?
00:20:21 What it is, is I have the rig,
00:20:23 all of the poses are keyframes
00:20:25 in my animation software.
00:20:26 I do it in flash, right?
00:20:28 So they're all just keyframes
00:20:30 with symbols.
00:20:31 And if you change, like,
00:20:32 what is inside a symbol,
00:20:34 it updates on every frame.
00:20:36 So I have, like, a temporary hair,
00:20:38 like, for the tail,
00:20:39 temporary hair on the head,
00:20:40 I have a temporary cutie mark,
00:20:41 a bunch of temporary stuff.
00:20:43 And then I, there is an algorithm
00:20:44 that automatically recolors
00:20:45 everything in the file,
00:20:47 so that's easy for recoloring.
00:20:48 And then I just vector,
00:20:49 like, the tail, the hair,
00:20:50 the cutie mark, whatever.
00:20:52 And once I've done that,
00:20:53 I can just go through all the frames
00:20:55 and, like, make small adjustments.
00:20:56 Like, if the hair is really big,
00:20:57 it might, like, clip into, like,
00:20:59 the neck or something
00:21:00 at a certain point,
00:21:01 so I'll have to find all the frames
00:21:02 where it clips into the neck
00:21:03 and, like, move it slightly
00:21:04 or, like, erase part of it.
00:21:06 Like, I do have to do
00:21:07 a bit of manual work,
00:21:08 but most of it's pretty automated.
00:21:10 And, um, yeah,
00:21:12 using the power of capitalism,
00:21:14 I lure people into buying the bigger packs
00:21:16 because it's slightly cheaper
00:21:17 than getting the smaller packs,
00:21:19 like, per image.
00:21:20 You say, you ask them
00:21:21 if they want a supersize.
00:21:22 Yeah, they want a supersize.
00:21:23 You get 150 images
00:21:24 for only $20 extra.
00:21:26 And they're like, yes.
00:21:27 $20? Oh, my God.
00:21:29 God, the value.
00:21:30 Yeah, and I can get,
00:21:31 I can get, like,
00:21:33 oh, like, there was one day
00:21:34 where I did six in a day,
00:21:35 so, like, that was, like,
00:21:36 a thousand images in one day,
00:21:37 but I did.
00:21:38 That was my record.
00:21:39 But most characters of these days,
00:21:41 because I put,
00:21:42 I stupidly put more care
00:21:44 and attention into it,
00:21:45 it can take me a couple days
00:21:46 to do one now.
00:21:47 But if it's a really simple design,
00:21:49 I can knock out in, like,
00:21:50 two or three hours,
00:21:51 and that's, like, 120 bucks.
00:21:53 Not bad.
00:21:55 Wait, all right.
00:21:56 That's so funny.
00:21:57 Has your,
00:21:58 has your user name
00:21:59 stayed the same the whole time?
00:22:01 Were you always oblivionful?
00:22:03 I was,
00:22:05 oh, my God,
00:22:06 I used to be Pivot Master CF
00:22:08 way back.
00:22:10 I did Pivot Animations
00:22:12 forever ago,
00:22:13 and I just,
00:22:14 there was,
00:22:15 okay, there was a guy,
00:22:16 I don't know,
00:22:17 that's another tangent.
00:22:18 I got to stop myself.
00:22:19 A guy made stick figures on crack,
00:22:20 his name was Pivot Master DX.
00:22:22 I just put my initials there,
00:22:23 because I'm dumb,
00:22:24 and I was, like, 12th.
00:22:26 Yeah, I had oblivionfall as my name
00:22:28 since 2009.
00:22:30 There was an animation
00:22:31 on DarkDemon.org
00:22:32 called oblivion.fail,
00:22:34 because it, like,
00:22:35 back then,
00:22:36 if you didn't finish an animation,
00:22:38 you called it a fail.
00:22:39 Oh, look, here's an animation fail
00:22:40 or something.
00:22:41 I don't know.
00:22:42 And I'm, like,
00:22:43 oblivionfall,
00:22:44 that looks cool,
00:22:45 and I saved it.
00:22:46 And I'm, like,
00:22:47 that would be a cool user name.
00:22:49 Two weeks later,
00:22:50 my YouTube account gets hacked
00:22:51 and deleted.
00:22:52 And I'm, like,
00:22:53 oh, I guess I'll make that name.
00:22:55 And only later
00:22:56 did I realize it was fail
00:22:57 the whole time.
00:22:59 So, ooh, I'm an idiot.
00:23:01 That's for the takeoff.
00:23:02 That's a real fail.
00:23:04 That's my tragic backstory.
00:23:05 That's my tragic backstory.
00:23:06 Yeah.
00:23:07 I asked because
00:23:09 I was wondering whether you,
00:23:11 the whole time,
00:23:12 were the vector brony,
00:23:14 but I think that's someone else.
00:23:16 I have his business card.
00:23:17 I have a physical business card
00:23:18 that he gave me, though,
00:23:20 in 2014.
00:23:22 I made,
00:23:23 I did not use a rig.
00:23:25 I hand drew them.
00:23:27 I drew some pony.
00:23:28 Have I ever mentioned this?
00:23:29 That I drew some pony,
00:23:30 like,
00:23:31 pony in the corner poses
00:23:33 for a brony YouTuber.
00:23:35 For free,
00:23:36 just because I liked him?
00:23:37 Oh, I think I remember that.
00:23:39 Who was it?
00:23:40 His name was, like,
00:23:42 his, okay,
00:23:43 I remember his pony was dark blue.
00:23:45 He had, like,
00:23:46 long black hair
00:23:47 and, like, a goatee.
00:23:48 His name was Tom Oliver.
00:23:49 No.
00:23:51 But,
00:23:52 his cutie mark
00:23:53 was the fee symbol,
00:23:55 like, the Greek letter.
00:23:56 And his name was, like,
00:23:57 the philosophy brony,
00:23:58 or, like, the Gnostic brony,
00:24:00 or something like that.
00:24:01 Yeah, I remember it.
00:24:02 That guy.
00:24:03 I think,
00:24:04 is that the guy who, like...
00:24:05 I know his face.
00:24:06 His pony face.
00:24:07 He had a video
00:24:08 that said that Twilight Sparkle,
00:24:09 he made, like,
00:24:10 a philosophical argument
00:24:11 that Twilight Sparkle
00:24:12 died
00:24:13 and was replaced
00:24:14 by the Alicorn version.
00:24:15 That it is,
00:24:16 that it is, like,
00:24:17 philosophically impossible
00:24:18 for it to be the same
00:24:20 entity.
00:24:21 What we have is not
00:24:22 Twilight Sparkle,
00:24:23 but a new entity
00:24:24 that has replaced the old one.
00:24:25 I think I've seen this guy's videos.
00:24:26 I saw, like,
00:24:27 one where he was, like,
00:24:28 comparing, like,
00:24:29 the characters to, like,
00:24:30 you know, real philosophers
00:24:31 in history
00:24:32 and, like, going off
00:24:33 on all this lofty shit.
00:24:34 And I'm like,
00:24:35 I can't follow any of this.
00:24:36 It's retarded.
00:24:37 Has he got a...
00:24:38 Has he got a deep British voice,
00:24:39 English voice?
00:24:40 I think so.
00:24:41 I don't know.
00:24:42 Maybe.
00:24:43 I don't...
00:24:44 Damn it.
00:24:45 I don't even remember, like,
00:24:46 any of his other videos.
00:24:47 He wasn't that big.
00:24:48 You know.
00:24:49 This was early in the
00:24:50 Brony analysis thing, so...
00:24:51 I think I saw him, though,
00:24:52 because, yeah, he had, like,
00:24:53 only a few hundred subscribers
00:24:54 when I saw it.
00:24:55 It sounds familiar, though.
00:24:56 It sounds very familiar.
00:24:57 I just liked his video,
00:24:58 and I had no creative outlet
00:24:59 at the time.
00:25:00 T-Bap didn't exist yet.
00:25:01 So I was like,
00:25:02 this guy is using, like,
00:25:03 the crappy, like,
00:25:04 show vectors.
00:25:05 It looks like ass.
00:25:06 I am going to...
00:25:07 The pony creator?
00:25:08 The pony creator vectors?
00:25:09 Yeah.
00:25:10 He had a pony creator avatar.
00:25:11 I'm like, this is unacceptable.
00:25:12 I get so many references.
00:25:13 So many clients
00:25:14 will send me their pony
00:25:15 creator character
00:25:16 as a reference.
00:25:17 Of course.
00:25:18 Of course.
00:25:19 And because they all re-use stuff
00:25:20 for those characters,
00:25:21 I just open up a previous rig
00:25:22 I've done,
00:25:23 and I just take the hair
00:25:24 because it's exactly the same,
00:25:25 and I just recolor it.
00:25:26 Mm-hmm.
00:25:27 Yeah.
00:25:28 And then,
00:25:29 and then,
00:25:30 I drew,
00:25:31 I drew him his poses.
00:25:32 I drew him in a custom,
00:25:33 in a different style.
00:25:34 I did,
00:25:35 I did a whole, like,
00:25:36 custom background for him.
00:25:37 So he's, like,
00:25:38 his pony is, like,
00:25:39 sitting behind a desk,
00:25:40 and there's, like,
00:25:41 it's like in, like,
00:25:42 a wizard's tower,
00:25:43 and he's got, like,
00:25:44 bookshelves,
00:25:45 and he's got, like,
00:25:46 stuff.
00:25:47 You know,
00:25:48 it was kind of nice.
00:25:49 I thought it was pretty okay.
00:25:50 So,
00:25:51 you know,
00:25:52 pat myself on the back
00:25:53 for that.
00:25:54 And then he, like,
00:25:55 quit doing YouTube.
00:25:56 Keep making pony analysis videos,
00:25:57 philosophy,
00:25:58 brony,
00:25:59 or whatever your name is.
00:26:00 Where did you go?
00:26:01 I need a return on my investment.
00:26:02 You gotta be the change
00:26:03 you want to see in the world.
00:26:04 You gotta come back yourself.
00:26:06 You gotta,
00:26:07 you gotta
00:26:08 research the fandom.
00:26:09 Single-handed.
00:26:10 I don't even know
00:26:11 what all those people are doing.
00:26:13 Like,
00:26:14 the show is completely over.
00:26:15 They probably just went and got jobs.
00:26:16 Nah, it's impossible.
00:26:17 They never do that.
00:26:18 They probably just,
00:26:19 like,
00:26:20 got married or something.
00:26:21 I don't know.
00:26:22 I know K.P.
00:26:23 is reviewing,
00:26:24 like,
00:26:25 not pony stuff now.
00:26:26 What cringe?
00:26:27 I mean,
00:26:28 that's,
00:26:29 that's the normal.
00:26:30 Just,
00:26:31 like,
00:26:32 continue doing the same thing,
00:26:33 but with different media.
00:26:34 But,
00:26:35 like,
00:26:36 how successful is that?
00:26:37 Are people still clamoring
00:26:38 for pony reviews?
00:26:39 Probably not.
00:26:40 I mean,
00:26:41 there will,
00:26:42 there will always be,
00:26:43 there will always be
00:26:44 more audience for that.
00:26:45 Yeah.
00:26:46 But it's,
00:26:47 yeah,
00:26:48 it's not what it used to be.
00:26:49 It never will be.
00:26:50 Even if,
00:26:51 even if,
00:26:52 like,
00:26:53 my little pony,
00:26:54 Gen 5 or whatever,
00:26:55 came out,
00:26:56 and it was,
00:26:57 like,
00:26:58 a hit,
00:26:59 and it was popular again,
00:27:00 I think even if it rivaled
00:27:01 Gen 4 in its popularity,
00:27:02 the,
00:27:03 like,
00:27:04 brony YouTuber thing would not
00:27:05 happen again,
00:27:06 because it would be,
00:27:07 like,
00:27:08 be seen as sort of like
00:27:09 an old,
00:27:10 like,
00:27:11 sort of embarrassing thing
00:27:12 that they used to do
00:27:13 and it might get awkwardly,
00:27:14 like,
00:27:15 tacked onto the cartoon review
00:27:17 fandom quote-unquote.
00:27:18 I think,
00:27:19 I think some people would do it,
00:27:20 but I think more people
00:27:21 would see it as cringe.
00:27:22 I,
00:27:23 I mean,
00:27:24 if it's actually is,
00:27:25 like,
00:27:26 interesting,
00:27:27 like,
00:27:28 like,
00:27:29 if you could do philosophy
00:27:30 about fucking
00:27:31 the next gen of pony,
00:27:32 and people start doing it,
00:27:33 I think
00:27:34 people will appear
00:27:35 that have never heard of
00:27:37 the previous,
00:27:38 like,
00:27:39 even younger youngsters
00:27:41 will,
00:27:42 get into that
00:27:43 and then it'll become
00:27:44 a whole different thing.
00:27:45 Yeah,
00:27:46 you know,
00:27:47 I guess the itch
00:27:48 that that kind of content
00:27:49 scratches
00:27:50 is probably just part of
00:27:51 the human condition
00:27:52 and will never go away.
00:27:54 So yeah,
00:27:55 Minecraft.
00:27:56 So yeah,
00:27:57 Minecraft Steve, baby.
00:27:58 I,
00:27:59 I might get a switch
00:28:00 just to play as Minecraft Steve.
00:28:02 Although,
00:28:03 I,
00:28:04 the DLC pack
00:28:05 for,
00:28:06 like,
00:28:07 the,
00:28:08 like the second roster
00:28:09 characters is three more
00:28:10 that has to be revealed.
00:28:11 I kind of feel like
00:28:12 it's worth
00:28:13 waiting
00:28:14 to see if I want to buy
00:28:15 the,
00:28:16 the season pass.
00:28:17 I don't like
00:28:18 gambling on whether the,
00:28:19 they will be characters
00:28:20 I care about,
00:28:21 but like,
00:28:22 I don't want to just
00:28:23 get Steve,
00:28:24 if later on
00:28:25 I want to get
00:28:26 one of the other ones.
00:28:27 Um,
00:28:28 oh,
00:28:29 would like,
00:28:30 would like it save money?
00:28:31 It, it would,
00:28:32 like get the season pass
00:28:33 and then you get all of them
00:28:34 instead of having like
00:28:35 buy them separately.
00:28:36 You can get the season pass
00:28:37 for the DLC
00:28:38 and it will be like,
00:28:39 I think at the moment
00:28:40 the arms lady,
00:28:41 the spring lady,
00:28:42 Steve,
00:28:43 and then three more.
00:28:44 And once those are revealed,
00:28:46 I will know whether I want
00:28:48 to save money on getting all of them
00:28:50 or just Steve.
00:28:52 Who's it going to be?
00:28:54 Uh,
00:28:55 duh.
00:28:56 People have been not looking
00:28:57 for Gino for ages.
00:28:59 I don't know whether that's going to-
00:29:00 It's just not that many more
00:29:01 video games.
00:29:02 Um,
00:29:04 uh,
00:29:05 it's probably going to be
00:29:06 Gohu
00:29:07 right here.
00:29:09 Homer Simpson,
00:29:10 maybe.
00:29:11 Oh, yeah.
00:29:12 He's a video game.
00:29:13 That would be so good.
00:29:14 That would be so funny.
00:29:15 SpongeBob SquarePant.
00:29:18 I know people argue
00:29:19 that Goku is technically
00:29:20 a Nintendo character
00:29:21 because like the
00:29:22 Budakai games were on
00:29:23 a Nintendo console
00:29:24 or something like that.
00:29:25 So I like,
00:29:26 they could do it.
00:29:27 I,
00:29:28 I remember Digi's video
00:29:29 about like why Goku
00:29:30 could be a Smash character.
00:29:31 Oh, maybe that's what
00:29:32 I'm thinking of.
00:29:33 Cause it was,
00:29:34 it was like,
00:29:35 um,
00:29:36 if,
00:29:37 and Dragon Ball Z
00:29:38 have been in
00:29:39 tons of games
00:29:40 that people love and cherish.
00:29:41 And I'm like,
00:29:42 you know what,
00:29:43 that's a decent argument.
00:29:44 It just feels weird.
00:29:45 But I wouldn't-
00:29:46 I wouldn't like
00:29:47 flip my shit
00:29:48 if Goku got in.
00:29:49 I wouldn't be like,
00:29:50 this sucks.
00:29:51 Is the argument,
00:29:52 is the argument against it
00:29:53 that like the character
00:29:54 should have originated
00:29:55 in gaming?
00:29:56 Yes, I think so.
00:29:57 I guess I could see that too.
00:29:59 Uh,
00:30:00 yeah.
00:30:01 I could see,
00:30:02 I could see
00:30:03 the arguments for
00:30:04 and against Goku.
00:30:05 Uh,
00:30:06 I think it would be really funny.
00:30:07 I want to smash-
00:30:08 There's,
00:30:09 there's the Toho girl as well.
00:30:11 Who?
00:30:12 To- Toho girl with red
00:30:14 clothing.
00:30:15 I don't play Toho,
00:30:16 but-
00:30:17 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:30:18 Ray, Riemu,
00:30:19 Mie-Maru.
00:30:20 Are those on Switch?
00:30:22 No, those are like,
00:30:24 well,
00:30:25 actually, I don't know.
00:30:26 But,
00:30:27 that's a big gaming thing.
00:30:28 What are they on Nintendo consoles?
00:30:30 I think they're-
00:30:31 Well, that doesn't-
00:30:32 I don't think that has
00:30:33 anything to do,
00:30:34 cause Banjo-Kanzui is still
00:30:35 well,
00:30:36 actually, I guess it's on-
00:30:37 Banjo-Kanzui,
00:30:38 those on the N64,
00:30:39 what are you talking about?
00:30:40 I thought you were talking about
00:30:41 like, current,
00:30:42 like, oh, if they can't advertise
00:30:43 on the Switch,
00:30:44 why would they put a character in,
00:30:45 but like-
00:30:46 No, I mean,
00:30:47 I thought the idea was that
00:30:48 they would only include a character
00:30:49 if it was on,
00:30:50 in a game
00:30:51 that was on Nintendo consoles.
00:30:52 So,
00:30:53 if like,
00:30:54 Toho's not on-
00:30:55 on Nintendo consoles,
00:30:56 then I think they're out,
00:30:57 right?
00:30:58 I suppose
00:30:59 they gotta make a new one
00:31:01 and put it on Switch.
00:31:02 I mean,
00:31:03 I don't see why not.
00:31:04 It's a big-
00:31:05 They're putting the fucking shit,
00:31:06 like,
00:31:07 Undertale on Switch,
00:31:08 so why not?
00:31:09 Crash Bandicoot,
00:31:10 the remastered trilogy,
00:31:12 I think,
00:31:13 was put on Switch.
00:31:14 Oh,
00:31:15 that's-
00:31:16 So Crash could be-
00:31:17 They could total-
00:31:18 Okay,
00:31:19 that seems like a no-brainer then.
00:31:20 Crash Bandicoot would be epic.
00:31:22 Rayman would be epic.
00:31:24 You know,
00:31:25 just like,
00:31:26 save all of the poor souls
00:31:28 who got like,
00:31:29 trapped in,
00:31:30 like,
00:31:31 PlayStation All-Stars,
00:31:32 Battle Royale,
00:31:33 the most, uh,
00:31:34 attempt at like,
00:31:36 like,
00:31:37 you know,
00:31:38 showing up Nintendo
00:31:39 at anything ever.
00:31:40 Um,
00:31:41 where Sony got all of its
00:31:42 beloved play-
00:31:43 PlayStation characters
00:31:44 and
00:31:45 somehow made it
00:31:46 terrible and boring.
00:31:48 Um,
00:31:49 like,
00:31:50 just take all of them,
00:31:52 take fucking,
00:31:53 uh,
00:31:54 Ape Escape Man,
00:31:56 Spike,
00:31:57 take fucking
00:31:58 Jack and Daxter,
00:31:59 take all of the play-
00:32:00 just all of the
00:32:01 PlayStation characters
00:32:02 and a new character.
00:32:04 That's-
00:32:05 I mean, yeah.
00:32:06 Yeah,
00:32:07 like the more-
00:32:08 Oh, oh, here's-
00:32:09 Nintendo gobbles up IPs.
00:32:12 Here's my-
00:32:13 The worlds are-
00:32:14 Here's my big, I wish,
00:32:15 please,
00:32:16 um,
00:32:17 one that,
00:32:18 um,
00:32:19 it could definitely happen,
00:32:20 but,
00:32:21 I haven't seen any reason
00:32:23 or like,
00:32:24 hype around it,
00:32:25 is a Matarasu
00:32:26 from Okani.
00:32:27 The dog.
00:32:28 The white dog.
00:32:29 Oh,
00:32:30 that would be sick!
00:32:31 That'd be awesome.
00:32:32 She's got so many,
00:32:33 like,
00:32:34 cool weapons and moves
00:32:35 and attacks
00:32:36 and she's a dog
00:32:37 and that's funny.
00:32:38 And, um,
00:32:39 she's
00:32:40 so
00:32:41 cool.
00:32:42 Like,
00:32:43 imagine an Okami themed
00:32:44 smash stage.
00:32:45 Just-
00:32:46 That'd be so cool.
00:32:47 It'd be so fucking
00:32:48 sick.
00:32:49 I want that.
00:32:50 They already have
00:32:51 Bayonetta,
00:32:52 so like,
00:32:53 they have links to
00:32:54 the studio.
00:32:55 This is a hype.
00:32:56 This is a hype idea.
00:32:57 I like this a lot.
00:32:58 I hope they do it.
00:32:59 I hope they fucking do it.
00:33:00 I mean,
00:33:01 there's no,
00:33:02 it's Team Cherry,
00:33:03 right?
00:33:04 Is the one that made
00:33:05 Okami?
00:33:06 No, that's
00:33:07 that's Hollow Knight.
00:33:08 Oh, fuck.
00:33:09 What's the
00:33:10 what's the team that made
00:33:11 Platinum Games,
00:33:12 previously known as
00:33:13 Clover Studio,
00:33:14 made Okami
00:33:15 and then
00:33:16 Platinum stuff,
00:33:17 Bayonetta
00:33:18 and whatever.
00:33:19 Which,
00:33:20 that's,
00:33:21 yeah,
00:33:22 that's the same company
00:33:23 that made Bayonetta.
00:33:24 So,
00:33:25 yeah,
00:33:26 okay,
00:33:27 they already got the
00:33:28 they got the connections
00:33:29 now that'd be sick.
00:33:30 That'd be so sick.
00:33:31 Yeah, I hope they do that.
00:33:32 Yeah, I mean,
00:33:33 I've hope they did
00:33:34 they did that for like ever.
00:33:35 Yeah,
00:33:36 that's the sort of thing
00:33:37 I want Nate to do,
00:33:38 like a big like,
00:33:39 oh my God,
00:33:40 it's in video.
00:33:41 I want to see another one of
00:33:43 those, but with like,
00:33:44 I don't know,
00:33:45 some cool Japanese music.
00:33:46 Yeah,
00:33:47 I love,
00:33:48 I love Japan period.
00:33:49 Yes.
00:33:50 And manga.
00:33:51 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:33:52 Um,
00:33:53 well,
00:33:54 uh,
00:33:55 so,
00:33:56 so Smash Bros.
00:33:57 Yeah,
00:33:58 so yeah,
00:33:59 I like Minecraft.
00:34:00 Hey,
00:34:01 you heard of Minecraft.
00:34:02 That's a game
00:34:03 that's still cool.
00:34:04 I played that.
00:34:05 I played that once.
00:34:06 PCP Minecraft,
00:34:07 where you can play Minecraft
00:34:08 while you're playing Minecraft
00:34:09 and play Pokemon
00:34:10 at the same time.
00:34:11 The PCP Minecraft server.
00:34:13 Subscribe below.
00:34:14 I totally said
00:34:15 that I was going to,
00:34:16 um,
00:34:17 stream another
00:34:18 uh,
00:34:19 Shackles for Heckles
00:34:20 like last week
00:34:21 and then just didn't do it.
00:34:22 I said,
00:34:23 I said I was going to do it
00:34:24 on Wednesday
00:34:25 and then I just forgot.
00:34:26 Well,
00:34:27 um,
00:34:28 because
00:34:29 uh,
00:34:30 I have in my brain
00:34:31 a brand new
00:34:32 build,
00:34:33 a big
00:34:34 building that I will build.
00:34:35 I,
00:34:36 because,
00:34:37 um,
00:34:38 uh,
00:34:39 I went to,
00:34:40 on the holiday,
00:34:41 I went to see some ruins.
00:34:42 This is ruins like
00:34:43 Priory,
00:34:44 a big old church,
00:34:45 monastery,
00:34:46 place where monks
00:34:47 would go
00:34:48 and,
00:34:49 you know,
00:34:50 be praying and shit.
00:34:51 Um,
00:34:52 and it's a whole big complex
00:34:53 of ruins
00:34:54 in this park
00:34:55 and they had these
00:34:56 um,
00:34:57 signs
00:34:58 with like,
00:34:59 here's some history
00:35:00 about stuff.
00:35:01 I took pictures
00:35:02 of all the signs
00:35:03 and all like the
00:35:04 blueprint layouts
00:35:05 of the place
00:35:06 and I got as many angles
00:35:07 as I could
00:35:08 and I'm going to use those pictures
00:35:09 to recreate
00:35:10 the,
00:35:11 the Priory of St.
00:35:12 Pancras
00:35:13 in Minecraft,
00:35:14 in the Minecraft
00:35:15 PCB
00:35:16 Minecraft server.
00:35:17 That's my goal.
00:35:18 Wow.
00:35:19 Pretty,
00:35:20 pretty cool.
00:35:21 Must have,
00:35:22 must have left an impression
00:35:23 on you,
00:35:24 I guess.
00:35:26 Um,
00:35:27 MarinPan
00:35:28 sent me
00:35:29 a screenshot
00:35:30 of the progress,
00:35:31 some progress
00:35:32 that's been made
00:35:33 on building a
00:35:34 New Los Angeles city
00:35:35 and it looks really good.
00:35:36 I guess that's what
00:35:37 they've been doing
00:35:38 while I was,
00:35:39 forgetting to stream.
00:35:40 So,
00:35:41 I'll have to,
00:35:42 we'll have to,
00:35:43 I'll have to,
00:35:44 what's the word,
00:35:45 feature that.
00:35:46 I'll have to
00:35:47 show that off a little bit.
00:35:48 Maybe we'll do it
00:35:49 Wednesday,
00:35:50 which,
00:35:51 if you're listening,
00:35:52 we'll have been
00:35:53 this past Wednesday
00:35:54 if you want to see that.
00:35:55 Okay.
00:35:56 Cool.
00:35:57 What else?
00:35:58 What else we got?
00:35:59 What's going on guys?
00:36:00 Uh, well,
00:36:01 which one of you
00:36:02 gave the president COVID?
00:36:03 Um,
00:36:04 it was me.
00:36:05 Oh,
00:36:06 yeah,
00:36:07 me too.
00:36:08 Oh,
00:36:09 it was all three of us
00:36:10 at the same time.
00:36:11 Oh,
00:36:12 you sold your,
00:36:13 you sold your hair
00:36:14 so I could buy
00:36:15 these combs and all
00:36:16 you sold just
00:36:17 your swatch so I could buy
00:36:18 this chain and all
00:36:19 you gave the president
00:36:20 COVID,
00:36:21 but I was giving
00:36:22 the president
00:36:23 for the express purpose
00:36:24 of COVID.
00:36:25 Yes.
00:36:26 It was my plan.
00:36:27 Where do you live in America?
00:36:28 Where are you from?
00:36:29 I'm,
00:36:30 I forget.

00:36:33 Oh, New Zealand.
00:36:34 I don't fucking know.
00:36:35 It's all the same.
00:36:36 Every English-speaking person
00:36:37 could live anywhere.
00:36:38 It's a fake country.
00:36:39 Low Australia.
00:36:40 It's not real.
00:36:41 It's a tiny little island.
00:36:42 I was there
00:36:43 for my whole life up until recently.
00:36:44 New Zealand,
00:36:45 like,
00:36:46 like Flight of the Concords,
00:36:47 right?
00:36:48 Yeah,
00:36:49 Flight of the Concords.
00:36:50 Yeah,
00:36:51 like Lord of the Rings.
00:36:52 Yeah.
00:36:53 Well,
00:36:54 yes.

00:37:01 Well,

00:37:47 debate once and for all.
00:37:48 Fucking
00:37:49 I promise.
00:37:51 Like America is so
00:37:52 different.
00:37:53 It is so fucking different
00:37:54 being here.
00:37:55 America is basically
00:37:56 a continent.
00:37:57 It is.
00:37:58 It is pretty much
00:37:59 like the thing
00:38:00 in New Zealand is that
00:38:01 everyone knows everyone.
00:38:02 Like
00:38:03 the common thing is
00:38:04 like two degrees of
00:38:05 separation.
00:38:06 Like the friend of your
00:38:07 friend like knows
00:38:08 like if you
00:38:09 if you took all your
00:38:10 friends and took all their
00:38:11 friends,
00:38:12 that's the whole country
00:38:13 basically.
00:38:14 Like
00:38:15 and because of that
00:38:16 like it's common
00:38:17 like for just to just
00:38:18 end up on TV
00:38:19 like that.
00:38:20 Really?
00:38:21 Yeah.
00:38:22 Like my parents have been
00:38:23 like interviewed on like
00:38:24 live television a few times.
00:38:25 Actually maybe that's
00:38:26 not as common.
00:38:27 Maybe that's just a thing
00:38:28 my parents did.
00:38:29 But I don't know.
00:38:30 Wait.
00:38:31 All right.
00:38:32 I'm looking into the size
00:38:33 because I'm
00:38:34 I thought it was
00:38:35 like the same size
00:38:36 as the UK.
00:38:37 Turns out
00:38:38 United Kingdom
00:38:39 243,000
00:38:40 square kilometers.
00:38:41 New Zealand
00:38:42 268,000
00:38:43 square kilometers.
00:38:44 So it's ever so
00:38:45 slightly bigger
00:38:46 and it you're saying
00:38:47 everybody knows
00:38:48 population is small.
00:38:49 Yeah.
00:38:50 Actually, yeah, of course.
00:38:51 There's like loads of farmland
00:38:52 there or something.
00:38:53 It's mostly farmland
00:38:54 and mountains and forest
00:38:55 and like a few cities
00:38:56 and like a fifth
00:38:58 of the country is in one city.
00:39:00 I mean, how much of America
00:39:01 lives in big cities?
00:39:02 It's like a lot of it, right?
00:39:04 Population of the UK
00:39:05 is 67 million
00:39:06 population of
00:39:08 new.
00:39:09 This is like 5 million.
00:39:10 Oh,
00:39:11 wall.
00:39:12 Owned.
00:39:13 We have more people
00:39:15 than you that
00:39:17 therefore we need
00:39:18 where we're suffering
00:39:19 and people are starving to death.
00:39:21 We have more sheep than people
00:39:23 and we'll trample you.
00:39:24 Is that true?
00:39:25 Yeah, we do.
00:39:26 We have like several times
00:39:27 more sheep than people.
00:39:28 Do they vote?
00:39:29 Yes.
00:39:31 Well,
00:39:32 if only if only if a human
00:39:34 marries them,
00:39:35 they can vote.
00:39:37 It's fucking you.
00:39:39 My parents
00:39:40 are trying to tell me to vote
00:39:41 in the New Zealand election
00:39:42 and I have no idea
00:39:43 what the fuck is even going on
00:39:44 in that country right now.
00:39:46 I'm not going to...
00:39:47 Are you guys
00:39:48 in the midst of a
00:39:49 fascist coup right now?
00:39:51 New Zealand is like...
00:39:52 Oh, that's cool.
00:39:53 I always like...
00:39:54 I wonder how that feels.
00:39:55 I always assumed
00:39:56 because New Zealand is
00:39:57 like extremely progressive
00:39:58 but I didn't know that growing up
00:40:00 because like my family
00:40:01 was always like sort of
00:40:02 like center right-leaning
00:40:04 but that's like right-leaning
00:40:05 by New Zealand standards
00:40:06 which is still pretty left.
00:40:07 Yeah.
00:40:08 So I'm like,
00:40:09 America,
00:40:10 I'm sure if a right over there
00:40:11 is pretty good probably
00:40:14 yeah, healthcare,
00:40:15 who needs it?
00:40:16 I don't have that.
00:40:17 It turns out,
00:40:18 I actually did.
00:40:19 It turns out I had
00:40:20 universal healthcare
00:40:21 of a whole time
00:40:22 and no one told me.
00:40:23 It's like weird.
00:40:24 I go to America
00:40:25 and I'm like, oh.
00:40:26 Well, yeah,
00:40:27 like why would they need to tell you?
00:40:28 Like obviously.
00:40:29 It's going to cost
00:40:30 $20,000 to stub my toe.
00:40:32 Actual statistic.
00:40:33 Look it up.
00:40:34 No.
00:40:35 A real statistic I learned
00:40:36 is delivering a baby,
00:40:38 $40,000.
00:40:39 Oh, you want to hold the baby?
00:40:40 That's an extra $150.
00:40:42 Oh, you want to,
00:40:43 you want to kiss it on the cheek?
00:40:44 That's an extra thousand.
00:40:45 Wait, wait.
00:40:47 That can't be real.
00:40:49 They can't charge
00:40:50 for delivering a baby.
00:40:52 I have heard this too.
00:40:53 I know.
00:40:54 I thought it has to be free.
00:40:55 But I looked it up
00:40:56 and several people have showed
00:40:57 like people took screenshots
00:40:58 of the bill,
00:40:59 people who didn't have insurance.
00:41:00 $40,000.
00:41:04 Unbelievable.
00:41:05 Just tell the child
00:41:06 they'll have to work
00:41:08 in the hospital.
00:41:09 It's even more expensive
00:41:10 to be born.
00:41:11 It's even more expensive
00:41:12 to be born than it is to die.
00:41:13 Probably not, actually.
00:41:15 Maybe it is.
00:41:16 I don't know.
00:41:17 It's easy to die.
00:41:18 You get like a rock
00:41:19 and you just hit your head
00:41:20 with it until you're dead.
00:41:22 I don't know if it's the same.
00:41:23 Yeah, but then everywhere
00:41:24 in America.
00:41:25 Insurance though.
00:41:26 They got to clean your carcass up.
00:41:28 That's not cheap.
00:41:29 Nah, it's easy.
00:41:30 You just drump in the
00:41:31 drump in the ocean.
00:41:33 Drump in a bitch.
00:41:36 Cool.
00:41:41 I feel like I should have more
00:41:42 to say about that,
00:41:43 but yeah,
00:41:47 that's what's up.
00:41:49 The only other thing
00:41:50 about New Zealand
00:41:51 that I know
00:41:54 is that they had
00:41:55 a flag referendum
00:41:57 not too long ago.
00:41:58 Oh, yeah.
00:41:59 To get a better flag.
00:42:02 Yes.
00:42:03 Yeah, our flag looks
00:42:04 just like the Australia flag.
00:42:07 You change one line, basically.
00:42:10 It's embarrassing.
00:42:11 It's really embarrassing.
00:42:13 There was a competition
00:42:14 to change the flag
00:42:15 and a bunch of people sent in designs.
00:42:19 So the New Zealand flag,
00:42:21 the Australian flag
00:42:22 basically just has one extra star
00:42:24 and the stars are white
00:42:25 instead of red, right?
00:42:26 Is that the difference?
00:42:27 Yeah, something like that.
00:42:30 Is that the Pleiades
00:42:31 on the flag?
00:42:33 It's the Southern Cross
00:42:34 for New Zealand, I think.
00:42:38 The flag referendum,
00:42:39 I was like all for it,
00:42:40 but a bunch of people were like,
00:42:41 yeah, but we don't like
00:42:42 the Prime Minister
00:42:43 at the current time.
00:42:44 We don't like him.
00:42:45 We don't like John Key.
00:42:46 So let's just vote no
00:42:47 just to piss him off.
00:42:49 And I'm like, guys,
00:42:50 I just want a good flag.
00:42:53 Some of the designs are really cool.
00:42:56 I heard about it
00:42:57 through the Hello Internet podcast
00:42:59 where they talked about it.
00:43:00 Oh, that's a good podcast.
00:43:01 Yeah.
00:43:02 It is.
00:43:03 Worse than this one.
00:43:04 Don't listen to it.
00:43:05 Way worse.
00:43:07 Some of these,
00:43:08 I just, I looked up
00:43:09 New Zealand flag referendum.
00:43:10 Some of these are like weird looking,
00:43:12 but I like them.
00:43:13 I like them.
00:43:14 They're all like swirling.
00:43:15 Yeah, I like,
00:43:16 because I think it was
00:43:17 something to do with
00:43:18 something,
00:43:19 New Zealand.
00:43:20 Are you the answer, right?
00:43:22 Yeah.
00:43:23 I think there was a reason
00:43:25 that it was a certain way.
00:43:28 No.
00:43:30 Okay.
00:43:31 I think it came down to,
00:43:32 I don't know if it was
00:43:33 the bottom left over top right
00:43:34 in the end,
00:43:35 but I liked both of those.
00:43:36 I liked the bottom left
00:43:37 a little more, but.
00:43:38 The top right is almost too cool.
00:43:40 Yeah.
00:43:41 It's almost like video game,
00:43:43 pirate crew sort of thing.
00:43:46 Yeah.
00:43:47 I do like it though.
00:43:48 The bottom left one
00:43:49 does look like,
00:43:50 I mean, that's just a pretty good.
00:43:51 Yeah.
00:43:52 I remember,
00:43:53 I remember looking at these things
00:43:54 and being like,
00:43:55 all of them have some aspect
00:43:56 that I really like.
00:43:57 The fur and the leaf,
00:43:59 but like the color choices
00:44:01 with all of these,
00:44:02 like I don't quite like
00:44:03 all of this color choices
00:44:04 that have the leaf.
00:44:06 And the black and white
00:44:07 with the swirly is great,
00:44:08 but it feels like it's
00:44:09 missing some aspect of it.
00:44:11 Yeah.
00:44:12 So the silver fern is like
00:44:13 a huge like New Zealand icon.
00:44:15 Our rugby team has it
00:44:17 as their thing.
00:44:18 And New Zealand is more
00:44:19 recognized for the silver fern
00:44:21 than it is for its own flag
00:44:22 pretty much.
00:44:24 Because like our rugby team
00:44:25 has like a ridiculous
00:44:26 like win record.
00:44:27 They win like,
00:44:28 I don't know.
00:44:29 It's like something like
00:44:30 80% of every game they win.
00:44:31 You know,
00:44:32 New Zealand is a great rugby
00:44:33 thing.
00:44:34 They're always in the big six.
00:44:36 It would be really funny.
00:44:37 I'm not,
00:44:38 I'm imagining like,
00:44:39 okay, Massachusetts has a shit flag.
00:44:41 Have you ever seen the
00:44:42 Massachusetts flag?
00:44:43 No, how do you spell
00:44:44 Massachusetts?
00:44:45 Fucking America.
00:44:46 Don't even worry about it.
00:44:47 American names.
00:44:48 I just have to say
00:44:49 American place names.
00:44:50 Stupid.
00:44:51 I don't like them.
00:44:52 That's great.
00:44:53 That's racist.
00:44:54 It's a Native American name.
00:44:55 I take it back.
00:44:56 I take it back.
00:44:57 You piece of shit.
00:44:58 I just about.
00:45:00 Massachusetts has two S's and two T's
00:45:03 and the rest sounds like it says.
00:45:05 Google fixed it for me.
00:45:07 Let me see this.
00:45:08 Massive cheats.
00:45:09 I don't like.
00:45:10 Oh, this is a weird flag.
00:45:11 Yeah.
00:45:12 It's a weird flag.
00:45:13 It's not,
00:45:14 it's not super exciting.
00:45:15 That's not so bad.
00:45:16 I've seen worse.
00:45:17 You shouldn't have text
00:45:18 on your flag though.
00:45:20 No.
00:45:21 But like,
00:45:22 like it's got two to three colors.
00:45:24 It doesn't look like a terrible
00:45:26 garish piece of shit.
00:45:28 And it's got a shield.
00:45:29 So that's cool.
00:45:30 My problem with it is like,
00:45:32 this isn't a flag.
00:45:33 This is a crest.
00:45:34 Right.
00:45:35 Yeah.
00:45:36 It's just white.
00:45:38 Like the crest is fine for what it is,
00:45:39 but it's not a good flag.
00:45:41 In my opinion.
00:45:43 So I'm thinking like,
00:45:44 what if we.
00:45:46 I like that.
00:45:47 I like the blue and pink stripes though.
00:45:48 It's pretty nice.
00:45:49 Yeah.
00:45:50 Where did.
00:45:51 Yeah.
00:45:53 They must have hired someone real.
00:45:56 But,
00:45:57 but like,
00:45:58 imagine they were like,
00:45:59 okay guys,
00:46:00 we need a referendum.
00:46:01 It's time for a new flag.
00:46:02 And then it's like,
00:46:03 hmm,
00:46:04 what do we like here in Massachusetts?
00:46:05 Well,
00:46:06 the Boston Red Sox are really popular.
00:46:07 So then like,
00:46:08 we made like the new like Massachusetts state flag,
00:46:10 like a pair of Red Sox or something.
00:46:12 And it's like,
00:46:13 yep,
00:46:14 because we like those guys.
00:46:16 We just made,
00:46:17 we just based the flag on our baseball team.
00:46:20 Or hell,
00:46:21 you can have all the sports teams in there just on one flag
00:46:24 and like,
00:46:25 that's it.
00:46:26 Just like put them all next to each other.
00:46:27 Make it one of those like,
00:46:28 those patchwork jackets where you have like a million like
00:46:30 band logos and emblems and things.
00:46:32 Yeah.
00:46:33 If I,
00:46:34 if it wouldn't,
00:46:35 if it wouldn't distract me,
00:46:36 I would go and like cobble together the new like
00:46:39 state flag of Massachusetts right now.
00:46:41 It has to be made out of denim.
00:46:44 I will,
00:46:46 I will post it in the chat after,
00:46:48 after I will make it afterwards.
00:46:49 It'll be,
00:46:50 it'll take me five minutes,
00:46:51 but it'll be very epic.
00:46:52 Yes.
00:46:55 Right.
00:46:56 What the fuck are we talking about?
00:46:57 We're talking about flag referendum.
00:46:58 I don't,
00:46:59 I don't think they,
00:47:00 they didn't,
00:47:01 yeah, they blocked it.
00:47:02 Didn't they?
00:47:03 There was no new flag.
00:47:04 It didn't go through.
00:47:05 People,
00:47:06 it got blocked because
00:47:07 young people were like,
00:47:08 we don't like the prime minister.
00:47:09 Fuck you.
00:47:10 And old people are like,
00:47:11 we're boomers.
00:47:12 Fuck you.
00:47:13 And that was it.
00:47:14 Did they like just,
00:47:15 did people just like not want change?
00:47:17 I guess it almost went through.
00:47:18 It was pretty close.
00:47:19 I remember,
00:47:20 I was,
00:47:21 I was still living there at the time.
00:47:22 I voted on it,
00:47:23 but yeah.
00:47:24 Cause everyone who knows anything in America
00:47:26 wants us to stop making the penny.
00:47:29 We don't need the penny anymore.
00:47:30 Oh, we don't.
00:47:31 No, no you don't.
00:47:32 We boomers are just like,
00:47:33 no, it's got Lincoln on it.
00:47:34 And that's America.
00:47:36 Okay.
00:47:37 What about national pride?
00:47:38 I've lived,
00:47:39 I've lived through coin destruction.
00:47:41 The five cent coin in New Zealand
00:47:43 got yeeted out around 2007
00:47:46 or 2006.
00:47:47 Fucking good.
00:47:48 And it was fine.
00:47:49 Like we handed out,
00:47:50 we handed out coins
00:47:51 and then everything was fine.
00:47:53 In fact, it was easier.
00:47:54 And that's the five cent coin.
00:47:55 Did you like have to go
00:47:57 and like give them back?
00:47:58 I mean,
00:47:59 I mean, if you held on to them,
00:48:00 they would just become worthless.
00:48:01 But if you hand them in,
00:48:02 you can get an exchange.
00:48:03 So it's worth it.
00:48:04 They would exchange.
00:48:05 Yeah.
00:48:06 They also updated all the coins too.
00:48:07 Like they completely redid the currency.
00:48:08 They changed all the coins
00:48:10 to be a little bit lighter
00:48:11 and a little bit more like
00:48:13 material efficient.
00:48:14 I think they did that.
00:48:15 They did that in England, I think.
00:48:16 Yeah.
00:48:17 In like the 70s or 80s or something.
00:48:19 Or like not that long ago.
00:48:20 Yeah.
00:48:21 I mean, it was only like
00:48:22 10 years ago in New Zealand.
00:48:23 And yeah, everyone,
00:48:24 you just hand in your coins,
00:48:25 they give you the new coins
00:48:26 and that's,
00:48:27 it's easy.
00:48:28 It's fine.
00:48:29 It's not hard.
00:48:30 They've done a few,
00:48:31 like getting rid of things
00:48:33 recently in the UK as well.
00:48:34 They've changed all the paper money
00:48:36 to be like plastic money.
00:48:38 So it's,
00:48:39 it's plastic.
00:48:41 Yeah.
00:48:42 It feels different
00:48:44 and it's more durable
00:48:45 and doesn't crinkle and rumple
00:48:47 over time.
00:48:48 Oh yeah.
00:48:49 And they changed the one pound coin
00:48:50 to be a little different.
00:48:52 I think,
00:48:53 I can't remember what they did with that.
00:48:55 All right.
00:48:56 Here's an idea.
00:48:57 $2 coin.
00:48:58 We got that.
00:48:59 It's pretty cool.
00:49:01 Yeah.
00:49:02 We have a two pound coin as well.
00:49:04 I think,
00:49:05 I don't know if they have two Euro coins.
00:49:06 I thought they had like
00:49:07 two Euro and five Euro coins.
00:49:09 I really like big,
00:49:10 big value coins.
00:49:11 High value coins are good.
00:49:12 I hate,
00:49:13 like we,
00:49:14 we have a $1 coin.
00:49:15 We have a couple of different $1 coins
00:49:17 that are like technically valid
00:49:18 currency in America,
00:49:19 but nobody uses them.
00:49:20 Everyone hates them.
00:49:21 I'm the,
00:49:22 I'm the only one.
00:49:23 I'm the only one who likes them
00:49:24 and I wish we had bigger coins.
00:49:26 If,
00:49:27 if I can't wait,
00:49:28 I can't wait for Trump to die
00:49:29 so that we can commemorate him
00:49:31 with the new like $5 coin.
00:49:33 It's going to be so sick.
00:49:35 It's on the back.
00:49:36 It says billionaires only, please.
00:49:39 It'll be the $5 billion coin.
00:49:41 Yeah.
00:49:43 Oh my God.
00:49:44 That coin's sick.
00:49:45 Uranium.
00:49:46 I love that.
00:49:47 Yeah.
00:49:48 I've always liked the two pound
00:49:49 because it's like double,
00:49:50 just silver and gold.
00:49:51 Two colors.
00:49:52 That's,
00:49:53 that's fucking sick.
00:49:54 That's a,
00:49:55 I love,
00:49:56 yeah,
00:49:57 I love the two color coins.
00:49:58 They got them in Europe.
00:49:59 They don't have those here
00:50:00 and I think they're nice.
00:50:01 The little gears in the middle.
00:50:03 So intricate.
00:50:05 It's so like,
00:50:06 it doesn't,
00:50:07 it's weird how it's like abstract.
00:50:09 Yeah.
00:50:11 I don't know why,
00:50:12 but they always have the queen on the other side.
00:50:14 So the heads is always the queen.
00:50:16 Yeah.
00:50:17 The head is on the other side for my team.
00:50:18 And the others,
00:50:19 and they're like,
00:50:20 well, nothing else is worth
00:50:21 minting on the other side.
00:50:22 So just throw a bunch of gears on there.
00:50:24 Fuck it.
00:50:25 Yeah.
00:50:26 So it's the queen in our coin,
00:50:27 even though we're not technically
00:50:28 like,
00:50:29 beholden to the UK anymore.
00:50:31 That's some,
00:50:32 Canada too.
00:50:33 Canadian money,
00:50:34 I think all has the queen on it.
00:50:35 Look at this old lady.
00:50:36 After America revolted,
00:50:37 when you,
00:50:38 when New Zealand said,
00:50:39 be independent,
00:50:40 the UK is just like,
00:50:41 yes, honey.
00:50:45 Did you know,
00:50:46 this is probably
00:50:47 recently,
00:50:48 common knowledge,
00:50:49 but did you know that as the queen is aged,
00:50:51 they update her face to be older,
00:50:53 to be more accurate to herself?
00:50:55 No, I didn't know that.
00:50:56 So you can look at the back of a coin
00:50:58 to see how old it is
00:50:59 without looking at the year.
00:51:00 It'd be like,
00:51:01 oh, she's young there.
00:51:02 There was a video I saw
00:51:04 that like showed like
00:51:06 how the queen's face like changed on notes
00:51:08 or coins over time.
00:51:09 And like early on,
00:51:10 she was like,
00:51:11 she had to be like a fucking kid
00:51:12 at the beginning
00:51:13 when they started.
00:51:14 Yeah, she was very young
00:51:15 when she got the crown
00:51:17 and everyone was like,
00:51:18 oh my God,
00:51:19 it's so cool.
00:51:21 I'm watching on TV.
00:51:23 It was like the,
00:51:24 the reason,
00:51:25 the reason most people in the UK.
00:51:27 The reason television was invented.
00:51:29 I mean, literally the first thing
00:51:31 that people bought a TV for
00:51:33 was to watch the,
00:51:34 the coronation live.
00:51:36 That was, that was the selling point.
00:51:38 Epic.
00:51:39 That is so fucking cool.
00:51:40 This is the longest running,
00:51:41 take a picture of yourself every day,
00:51:43 YouTube video of all time.
00:51:44 It's still being made.
00:51:47 Imagine like a time lapse.
00:51:49 I wonder if someone's made a time lapse
00:51:51 of just like every year of the queen.
00:51:53 There is.
00:51:54 I saw one a few months back.
00:51:56 I mean, on the coins.
00:51:57 I mean, with the coins specifically.
00:51:59 Oh, maybe it might exist.
00:52:01 I don't think there are that many.
00:52:03 There's like maybe every couple of years
00:52:05 they would have one.
00:52:06 So maybe it would take a few seconds, but.
00:52:10 My back when I used to play
00:52:12 dwarf fortress,
00:52:13 one of my favorite things to do
00:52:15 was to have my dwarves mint coins.
00:52:18 And I would just look at them
00:52:20 and examine them and like see
00:52:22 like what they decided to like,
00:52:24 what images they decided to press
00:52:26 into their coins.
00:52:27 No, they would have like pictures
00:52:29 of like historical figures
00:52:31 and pictures of like, you know,
00:52:33 the king or pictures of like noblemen
00:52:35 from like other places or hero like folk heroes.
00:52:38 Or like sometimes they would have like
00:52:40 insignias from like the region they're in
00:52:43 or like their country or like their town has every
00:52:46 it turns out like every like town
00:52:48 and like principality has its own like logo
00:52:50 and sometimes you you find out what they are
00:52:52 because they mint them on the coin.
00:52:53 You're like, oh, I see.
00:52:55 Like the national symbol of you know,
00:52:57 bronze hammers is two diamonds
00:53:01 in a pool of lava.
00:53:03 Nice.
00:53:04 Minecraft.
00:53:05 Epic.
00:53:06 Bringing it back around.
00:53:07 And then they and they and like
00:53:10 and you mint them out of different metals
00:53:12 and like they'll put different things
00:53:13 on like the silver coin versus the gold coin
00:53:15 versus the platinum coin.
00:53:16 So it's so cool.
00:53:17 So satisfying.
00:53:18 Yeah.
00:53:19 But it's useless though.
00:53:20 Like they're used dwarf fortress used to have
00:53:22 a thing called like the dwarven economy
00:53:24 that was this whole like sub game
00:53:26 within the game this whole system
00:53:28 but it was like completely broken
00:53:29 and it got taken out.
00:53:30 So you can still like the dwarves
00:53:32 would trade with each other for money.
00:53:34 So you can still make the money
00:53:35 but it doesn't do anything.
00:53:36 It's just like it's just bullying basically.
00:53:38 Like you can trade it away and that's it.
00:53:40 It's a little disappointing.
00:53:43 Okay.
00:53:44 I said to go on a dwarf fortress.
00:53:45 I'm I'm every time dwarf fortress is brought up.
00:53:48 I'm like how could possibly have there been
00:53:52 so many like things thought of to program
00:53:55 to make that they have all of these different logos
00:53:58 in the game that they could choose from
00:54:00 to make when they decide to mint a coin.
00:54:02 It's just like how could they do that?
00:54:05 There's no way.
00:54:07 There's no way that dwarves could have
00:54:09 unique coin minting abilities.
00:54:11 And yet they do and yet they fucking do.
00:54:14 It's so good.
00:54:15 It's so big.
00:54:17 How do they do that?
00:54:20 They I mean I guess it's like the game
00:54:23 the game just generates all this shit.
00:54:26 It's like generates like a huge amount
00:54:28 of like background information
00:54:30 that like you will never be privy to.
00:54:32 Yeah, I really like like the idea that
00:54:35 you generate the world and you see what you see
00:54:38 but then like other like a whole list of like
00:54:42 like the name of the place you're at
00:54:44 or like the region and stuff like they come up
00:54:47 with all this I guess they draw from a list
00:54:50 of potential names for things
00:54:52 and then mash them together into like a list
00:54:55 of those places and past kings or whatever
00:54:59 that it keeps track of and then it just
00:55:01 when it comes up it comes up.
00:55:03 It generates like the whole like geographical
00:55:06 and like geopolitical history of the world
00:55:08 like from the beginning of creation
00:55:10 to like whenever to whenever you're playing
00:55:13 and it knows like you know how different like
00:55:16 leaders like founded countries and like how
00:55:18 different countries like moved and like
00:55:20 changed hands and like power was exchanged
00:55:22 and like who ruled each one and when and stuff
00:55:24 and it's because it like because it tracks
00:55:26 like the individual like creatures right
00:55:28 like the individual like creatures
00:55:30 that like would let go on to become like
00:55:32 you know kings or you know whatever.
00:55:35 I mean there are there are common elements to it
00:55:38 like there's always there's like the goblin empire
00:55:41 always exists and there's always like a demon
00:55:43 who was summoned at some point who usually
00:55:46 is the leader of them but sometimes the demon
00:55:48 can like be killed and like someone else
00:55:51 might rule the goblin empire or something
00:55:53 you know but like yeah the specifics of like
00:55:56 you know the different towns that they founded
00:55:58 like it knows all that it decides like
00:56:00 okay this one had this was called this
00:56:03 this was its logo this is who ruled it
00:56:05 I love how it was founded it's these were like
00:56:07 the battles it had against other towns.
00:56:09 It's just like my favorite thing because like
00:56:11 the real world is like that you look at the
00:56:14 the etymology of like English town names
00:56:17 they just mean like this guy's house was
00:56:20 next to this river and he was his name was
00:56:23 like sex and then it looks like sex and
00:56:26 or something or Samson and then it'll be like
00:56:29 Samson forward or and then like the town
00:56:32 name would be like like sounding similar to
00:56:35 that and it's like wow this name that seems
00:56:38 like a bunch of random syllables is just wasn't
00:56:41 like normal language and it's all most of the
00:56:44 towns were just so like what's this
00:56:47 cliff town it's near a cliff
00:56:53 I like how you said it like you just see
00:56:56 what you see like you don't like the only way
00:56:59 you like know the history is like your dwarf
00:57:01 makes a coin and you pick it up and you look at it
00:57:03 and it's like oh yeah on this coin is an image
00:57:06 of like you know George George
00:57:10 like Mick Mick elf fellow the elf who
00:57:14 became King of the Dwarven Empire between
00:57:17 the years like 200 and and 410 who
00:57:21 was slain by a bronze titan yeah the image
00:57:24 depicts him being crushed under the foot of a bronze titan
00:57:26 it's it's like oh cool I guess that
00:57:29 now I know it's
00:57:36 but it's like it's all there for you to
00:57:39 like archaeologically dig up and that's
00:57:42 it's just like real life you go to a
00:57:44 Wikipedia article of a place and you learn
00:57:46 all about it and it's like wow that was
00:57:48 not apparent at all you can you can make
00:57:51 it I mean you can like generate a world
00:57:53 and then just go into like like I forget
00:57:56 what it's called there's a mode where you
00:57:58 can just basically like look shit up and
00:58:00 you can look up like names and figures
00:58:02 and like just like look up like what's
00:58:05 this kingdom who was its leader like what's
00:58:07 their history look through that oh where
00:58:09 did they live oh look at that town oh they
00:58:11 had a battle against this other place who
00:58:13 fought in the battle you know you can
00:58:14 sort of just kind of dig through all this
00:58:16 like information without not instead of
00:58:19 actually like playing the dwarf game
00:58:21 because who has time for all that shit
00:58:23 I'm looking forward to dwarf fortress
00:58:26 too when they they get the heavy weapons
00:58:28 guy I want them to when are they going to
00:58:31 put dwarf fortress in smash when are they
00:58:33 going to just have the little like
00:58:34 dwarven smiley face just like be just
00:58:37 like moving like like square to square
00:58:40 just like creating a little square
00:58:45 next to it that represents that's being
00:58:47 mined out and like that's it that's its
00:58:49 hitbox or whatever I don't know I have no
00:58:52 idea what that would look like they'll
00:58:54 figure the map would be very very
00:58:56 interesting though the stage I mean what
00:58:59 if yeah what if instead of like instead
00:59:02 of the character they just had a map and
00:59:04 them and like you know your smash
00:59:06 characters are in the map but the map
00:59:08 is like a grid based and like the little
00:59:11 dwarves are going around the map like
00:59:13 digging out and mining and like building
00:59:14 and rebuilding and filling in and stuff
00:59:16 and just like yeah changing up their
00:59:19 fortress and whatever maybe they build
00:59:21 some like arrow traps and like they
00:59:22 shoot like ballistas at you at some
00:59:24 point I don't know that'd be cool that'd
00:59:26 be pretty neat right Sakurai you
00:59:28 listening get on the phone with Tarn
00:59:30 Adams he's got like cancer or something
00:59:33 so he needs to make money now so I'm
00:59:36 sure he'd be I'm sure he'd be interested
00:59:38 in in working out a deal with you I mean
00:59:40 if you did mine probably get a little
00:59:42 fortress it's kind of inspired minecraft
00:59:44 a little bit so old old good new bed is
00:59:47 dwarf fortress older than minecraft it is
00:59:49 not solicited as an inspiration hmm bring
00:59:54 it back to minecraft yeah it must have
00:59:57 it must have been it must have been in
01:00:00 like the early days of dwarf fortress
01:00:01 though because dwarf fortress has been
01:00:02 developed for like what like 20 years
01:00:04 or something right and something crazy
01:00:06 yeah yeah long ass freaking time
01:00:11 yeah so minecraft yeah so minecraft yeah
01:00:15 minecraft Steve I hope we should just
01:00:18 call this episode minecraft Steve I
01:00:21 mean I've been excited about some
01:00:23 minecraft news outside of that because I
01:00:26 don't know what a smash is I don't know
01:00:28 what a Nintendo is but we're getting
01:00:30 that that cave update that people have
01:00:32 been asking for for years and lots of
01:00:35 cool shit I don't know anything about
01:00:38 that yeah it's quite recent they've been
01:00:41 talking they've been the minecraft
01:00:43 Twitter has been making some videos with
01:00:45 showing off a scree a creepy mob that
01:00:49 appears to be like drawn to you by the
01:00:53 sound you make not by sight which is
01:00:56 like a different aspect he lives so far
01:00:58 underground that he's blind and he
01:01:00 attracts you down and yeah which is
01:01:02 which is such wait like who is this
01:01:05 it's a new scary monster that in the
01:01:08 cave update and like usually you play
01:01:11 the game you jump around you break
01:01:13 blocks because all of the enemies all
01:01:16 of them only react when they see you so
01:01:18 if you're not seen you're fine and now
01:01:21 with this scary like sound man you're
01:01:26 gonna have to think about like whether
01:01:28 you're running and jumping in the deep
01:01:31 dark depths and that's that's pretty cool
01:01:34 make sense make sense pretty good pretty
01:01:37 solid every time I see like an I hear
01:01:40 someone talk about a minecraft update
01:01:42 I'll like see the game and I will like
01:01:44 not see anything different about it and
01:01:47 then when I do hear like what they added
01:01:50 I'll be like really that like the last
01:01:54 one I heard about was like the one that
01:01:56 added the like pitchfork that it was
01:01:58 like the fish update the Trident and you
01:02:00 could have the tree at the Trident
01:02:02 weapon that you could and I was like that's
01:02:04 that's cool and all but like why like why
01:02:06 that I was like that's just like one
01:02:08 small part of like they can they completely
01:02:10 redid the oceans and like added a whole
01:02:12 bunch of stuff yeah I'm aware I'm aware
01:02:15 that there was more to it than than that
01:02:17 but like I guess it's just that I didn't
01:02:19 know how the oceans worked before so I
01:02:21 couldn't really see the difference so
01:02:23 that's probably why they didn't have
01:02:26 anything in them before they had
01:02:29 squids right there's like squids and
01:02:31 gravel and that was and at some point
01:02:33 they are they added the the the sea
01:02:37 undersea like temp oh the ocean monument
01:02:39 yeah ocean monuments those are kind of
01:02:41 cool but yeah if I completely like
01:02:43 redid the oceans and then they redid
01:02:45 villagers and redid the never and now
01:02:47 they're doing caves and all these
01:02:49 updates are pretty good I like it
01:02:51 villagers seems weird
01:02:53 villagers seemed like a weird addition
01:02:55 to the game to me they've been around
01:02:57 so long they've been around since like
01:02:59 2011 and they were really they were they
01:03:01 sucked they were terrible but now they're
01:03:03 kind of cool but I didn't like know about
01:03:05 them and then when I found out they were
01:03:07 in the game I was like why are these people
01:03:09 walking around like why do you want like
01:03:11 NPCs like in a village
01:03:13 like I don't know like the more
01:03:15 I feel like the more I found out about
01:03:17 Minecraft the less I understood it
01:03:19 because it seemed at first
01:03:21 when I knew literally nothing about
01:03:23 I was like oh it's a game about
01:03:25 building with blocks
01:03:27 and it's the natural environment and you
01:03:29 dig for stuff and like yep got it
01:03:31 but then like I don't know there's these
01:03:33 other like sort of esoteric things in
01:03:35 there like the villagers system and
01:03:37 shit and it's like I mean that stuff
01:03:39 still pretty surface level there is a
01:03:41 like a lot of like other hidden stuff
01:03:43 about Minecraft though that and redstone
01:03:45 and stuff yeah like the redstone stuff
01:03:47 the Psycraft people and I don't know
01:03:49 I'm a big mind head is that
01:03:51 the word I don't know the word is it's a
01:03:53 blockhead probably blockhead yeah
01:03:55 about you a blockhead uh well I'm
01:03:57 glad you're not a fucking globe head
01:03:59 I know the Illuminati are trying to tell
01:04:01 us that the earth's not the world is flat
01:04:03 it just has six sides you know
01:04:05 yeah
01:04:07 I believe in six flat earths
01:04:09 all glued together
01:04:11 cubically
01:04:13 dude I got to the edge of Minecraft and I
01:04:15 went 90 degrees and I played
01:04:17 Minecraft again
01:04:21 started over
01:04:23 I you know
01:04:25 speaking of video games
01:04:27 that they should be in Smash Brothers
01:04:29 a spore
01:04:31 when I was waiting for spore
01:04:33 when I was waiting for spore to come out
01:04:35 they I was
01:04:37 so hype because like
01:04:39 you've both seen the
01:04:41 the old spore video
01:04:43 do you know what I'm talking about the one that
01:04:45 I've seen a little bit of it yeah
01:04:47 I watched it the old one that Will Wright did
01:04:49 showing off the game before it was like
01:04:51 really like finished
01:04:53 but it's got it looks so cool
01:04:55 it looks so robust it's so it looks
01:04:57 the animations they work so dynamically
01:04:59 it's so like wow how did they do
01:05:01 that and then the real thing comes out
01:05:03 and like half of that shit's gone there's no
01:05:05 aquatic stage it's like it's just not the same
01:05:07 it must have just faked a lot of it
01:05:09 it's just bullshit
01:05:11 it got bought out
01:05:13 by a big company and the company
01:05:15 fucked it
01:05:17 I think it was
01:05:19 being made by EA from the beginning
01:05:21 was it I remember it being bought
01:05:23 by EA and then getting fucked
01:05:25 but I don't know the details
01:05:27 I mean maybe EA had something to do with it
01:05:29 but like I don't know
01:05:31 if there was
01:05:33 if like the stuff that you
01:05:35 could see in the demo
01:05:37 was possible
01:05:39 there's no way that it would have
01:05:41 been taken out like it's just the final
01:05:43 product is like demonstrably worse
01:05:45 in almost every way
01:05:47 I don't know like it's to the
01:05:49 point that like if they had to cut all that shit
01:05:51 for corporate reasons
01:05:53 then like Will Wright could have like taken
01:05:55 it and just like made a second game that was that other stuff
01:05:57 I don't know
01:05:59 it was very bizarre but
01:06:01 one of the things that you could do in it
01:06:03 was you could do terraforming and you can technically
01:06:05 do terraforming in the
01:06:07 actual spore game but it sucks
01:06:09 so bad
01:06:11 at least in the base game I know there was expansions later
01:06:13 but in the base game all you could do
01:06:15 was like you could put down like stamps
01:06:17 like you could fly around your
01:06:19 your fucking
01:06:21 you could fly around your fucking planet
01:06:23 and you could just put down like basically
01:06:25 stamps like basically little mountains that were like
01:06:27 shaped like things like star shape
01:06:29 or like spiral shape whatever and it sucked
01:06:31 it's so fuck
01:06:33 it's garbage Will Wright
01:06:35 he shows in the demo he has like sliders
01:06:37 that he can like dynamically change like
01:06:39 the planets like water levels he can change
01:06:41 he can change like
01:06:43 he could like change the atmospheric
01:06:45 composition in a way that would like
01:06:47 dynamically change like the water level and it would
01:06:49 like cause like he
01:06:51 he does
01:06:53 in the final game
01:06:55 there is a there is a thing
01:06:57 that you can do to like terraform a planet
01:06:59 and basically it's just you like throw down
01:07:01 an object
01:07:03 and it like terraforms the planet and now it's like
01:07:05 a habitable planet it's green it's lush
01:07:07 oceans are blue great
01:07:09 but that he talks about that being like like a
01:07:11 late game like final thing
01:07:13 in before that like
01:07:15 you could terraform planet but like you would have to
01:07:17 do it you know you would have to like throw
01:07:19 down like
01:07:21 volcanoes that would like release the right gases
01:07:23 you would have to like increase the temperature to like get
01:07:25 enough moisture in the air and like da da da da
01:07:27 and add add add hydration and make it rain
01:07:29 and like move all this stuff add life
01:07:31 seed life let life spread over there
01:07:33 do make uh uh uh uh
01:07:35 what's the word bacteria start to grow
01:07:37 and in the final game it's not that
01:07:39 it's just like you like click up like you have
01:07:41 money you click a button and like oh planets terraform
01:07:43 just fix okay that's my
01:07:45 spore rant but the thing
01:07:47 one thing that I really wanted to do
01:07:49 was he had this beam
01:07:51 that you could terraform the planet like you had
01:07:53 fine control like you could go to one little spot of it
01:07:55 and like pull it up and go next to it and like push it down
01:07:57 and you could like sculpt the planet and I was like
01:07:59 oh man it would be so cool if I took one of
01:08:01 those and I just made a cube and if
01:08:03 I just like sculpted the spherical planet
01:08:05 into a cube and had a cube planet yes so
01:08:07 that's where this was all going is it was going to be
01:08:09 Minecraft world uh but it never
01:08:11 happened because will write
01:08:13 fucked me over you lied
01:08:15 every time every time you
01:08:17 say will write I think you're saying will
01:08:19 Ryan and I get scared
01:08:21 who is who is that he's
01:08:23 my boss slash friend
01:08:25 da games man
01:08:27 oh hello
01:08:29 I hope he's listening to the podcast
01:08:31 I don't think he is
01:08:33 if he does hello fine
01:08:35 cool
01:08:37 um yeah and I'm just like
01:08:39 you opened it with saying a character
01:08:41 that should be in smash spore and I'm like
01:08:43 like like would you just
01:08:45 dynamically change based
01:08:47 on the battle that's happening and by the end
01:08:49 they like the super smash is like to be
01:08:51 fully evolved
01:08:53 oh like they evolve right like
01:08:55 they have like a bite attack and every time they bite
01:08:57 they get like more dna points or whatever
01:08:59 and like you can like spend it on
01:09:01 the fly like grow extra limbs or something
01:09:03 I'd be fucking neat that'd be neat oh
01:09:05 dude you customize your
01:09:07 character mid battle to make a giant like
01:09:09 a penis creature is that
01:09:11 the strat yeah that's the strat
01:09:13 I think I played spore
01:09:15 for a little bit or maybe I just watched a let's
01:09:17 play but it was definitely big
01:09:19 penis is involved
01:09:21 there might have been the game grumps um
01:09:23 yeah probably well I remember that
01:09:25 Russ was playing or something oh no
01:09:27 I can't remember but that was fun
01:09:29 I think that's the only spore let's play ever
01:09:31 saw and it was pretty funny
01:09:33 they just made like dicks and
01:09:35 butts and it was
01:09:37 really funny and I was like hey that's
01:09:39 a good game yeah
01:09:41 you can make him hold his own balls
01:09:43 as he walks around and his penis is a foot
01:09:45 has a foot so like jack hammers down when
01:09:47 he walks
01:09:49 just like me
01:09:55 oh oh well your penis has
01:09:57 a foot yeah I thought you meant I thought you said is
01:09:59 a foot I mean the penis has a foot on the end
01:10:01 of it and so when you walk like your back legs
01:10:03 walk normally but your front foot is like
01:10:05 I made I made a mistake
01:10:07 I misunderstood dab
01:10:09 dab dab
01:10:11 uh
01:10:13 ooh
01:10:15 so how so how are we doing
01:10:17 temp check temp check how are we doing
01:10:19 what's our energy level at right now
01:10:21 audience temp check audience type
01:10:23 temp check in the put in the comments
01:10:25 down below how hype are you right now
01:10:27 how high energy are you feeling
01:10:29 I'm thinking like a low to mid
01:10:31 two degrees
01:10:35 okay I don't know that's good
01:10:37 that's good enough we can work we can
01:10:39 work with that it's not dead I'm not
01:10:41 dead yet
01:10:43 I'm alive same ish
01:10:47 oh here's here's the thing
01:10:49 on the last PCP episode
01:10:53 it was like September 13th
01:10:55 I think
01:10:57 the next day
01:10:59 I announced on this is when we recorded
01:11:01 the last episode that I was on
01:11:05 the next day I talk about
01:11:07 how I'm trans now and so I
01:11:09 realized I haven't been on the PCP since
01:11:11 I made that tweet so people
01:11:13 aren't aware lol
01:11:15 there's just an update
01:11:17 for you I
01:11:19 I don't remember I think
01:11:21 me and Tom mentioned it
01:11:23 a little bit you might have like briefly
01:11:25 discussed that it was a thing that occurred
01:11:27 was that in the most recent one
01:11:29 with cyber shell
01:11:33 maybe or one of them I haven't finished watching
01:11:35 that one yet but yeah anyway um
01:11:37 yeah
01:11:39 I am
01:11:41 I am one of those
01:11:43 pretty epic
01:11:45 I don't really know what to say about it
01:11:47 there's a lot of aspects and I don't know
01:11:49 whether people give a shit
01:11:51 in the comments let us know if you give a shit
01:11:53 if you give a shit
01:11:55 put a comment
01:11:57 if you give a shit
01:11:59 give a little bit
01:12:01 give a little bit of shit
01:12:03 I've only had a few little like trans
01:12:05 thoughts in my head ever
01:12:07 trans thoughts
01:12:09 I think I had a dream
01:12:11 when I was like 11 and in the dream
01:12:13 I was just like a girl
01:12:15 in some kind of mech
01:12:17 suit thing and I don't know
01:12:19 it was nice but also
01:12:21 a penis good I want to keep it
01:12:23 I think that was
01:12:25 I think that was just the end of Metal Gear Solid
01:12:27 Peace Walker
01:12:31 maybe
01:12:33 yeah I mean I used to have
01:12:35 like thoughts like that
01:12:37 it's like what if I was a girl but I always assumed
01:12:39 that was just like a thing and everybody did
01:12:41 and maybe it is
01:12:43 I don't know if it's a thing
01:12:45 it was always weird like
01:12:47 after I decided
01:12:49 like you know all of these things they're clearly leading
01:12:51 to this one thing so I'll just say it
01:12:53 get it over with saying it
01:12:55 it's funny
01:12:57 but then like what about my actions
01:12:59 in the past
01:13:01 like was an indication
01:13:03 of this or was it
01:13:05 could all of them have been
01:13:07 like not related at all
01:13:09 and I was
01:13:11 just thinking about that a lot like
01:13:13 what about what I did
01:13:15 was like indicative of that
01:13:17 there's a few things that are very obviously
01:13:19 weird like girly
01:13:21 things that I wanted to do
01:13:23 like this one time
01:13:25 I really wanted this
01:13:27 at the gift shop
01:13:29 from this zoo
01:13:31 I think and I wanted a penguin purse
01:13:33 there's a little blue fluffy
01:13:35 penguin purse
01:13:37 and my parents were like
01:13:39 are you sure you want that
01:13:41 that's not very cool
01:13:43 maybe you'd like a toy dinosaur
01:13:45 instead you know something cool
01:13:47 and I'm like what
01:13:49 I didn't realize that it wasn't manly
01:13:51 to have a little pink
01:13:53 a little blue fluffy penguin purse
01:13:55 to put my coins in
01:13:57 but I don't know whether that was like
01:13:59 a gender thing
01:14:01 who says a man can't have a purse
01:14:03 exactly like it really
01:14:05 I don't think there's any like hard and fast
01:14:07 like oh this was a sign
01:14:09 and this wasn't like it's just
01:14:11 it's a very complex
01:14:13 web of stuff
01:14:19 I don't fucking know
01:14:21 sometimes you just want
01:14:23 big booby mommy milkers
01:14:25 and that's it you know
01:14:27 forget about the trans stuff
01:14:29 although there are like a hundred thousand trans
01:14:31 people in big booby mommy milkers
01:14:33 it's very trans inclusive
01:14:35 very trans positive
01:14:37 update on that server
01:14:39 it is turned into an ERP server
01:14:41 there's just people fucking each other constantly
01:14:43 it's completely debaucherous
01:14:45 like the worst
01:14:47 like AK the best and based
01:14:49 I you know
01:14:51 you know
01:14:53 that's cool
01:14:55 I guess
01:14:57 I'm in there I had sex
01:14:59 one time and I thought gay
01:15:01 I'm just gonna be the growth man
01:15:05 I have not had sex
01:15:07 just like in real life
01:15:09 I will never consent to sex
01:15:11 if you do question mark size
01:15:13 question mark size it'll tell you how many times
01:15:15 you've had sex
01:15:17 and there are a few people who are trying to maximize
01:15:19 that number by fucking everyone
01:15:21 all the time it's really funny
01:15:23 it's my favorite video game
01:15:25 for having sex
01:15:27 number go up
01:15:29 okay yeah sure
01:15:31 I mean I understand
01:15:33 that is all the motivation
01:15:35 that's really required
01:15:37 it's just really funny like at first
01:15:39 the server does having bigger boobs
01:15:41 make it easier to have more sex
01:15:43 no
01:15:45 but it is just fun to have
01:15:47 the way to have sex
01:15:49 alright here's the two avenues to sex
01:15:51 one
01:15:53 I want it to be like
01:15:55 cookie clicker where it's like
01:15:57 you start having sex
01:15:59 you have lots of sex but then you're like
01:16:01 man if I can make my boobs bigger
01:16:03 that will increase my rate of sex having
01:16:05 yeah every time you have sex you have
01:16:07 three times as much sex
01:16:09 every time you have sex you get bigger boobs
01:16:11 and every time you get bigger boobs you have more sex
01:16:13 so it's like mutually encouraging
01:16:15 a cycle
01:16:17 mutual reinforcing systems
01:16:19 crazy
01:16:21 until you're having more sex than there are
01:16:23 atoms in the universe
01:16:25 an exponential rise
01:16:27 to infinite sex
01:16:29 we could add that
01:16:31 I mean it's really funny
01:16:33 add infinite sex to the bottom
01:16:35 please
01:16:37 it's really funny like watching
01:16:39 the progression of the server
01:16:41 go from haha this is all just for fun
01:16:43 this is all just goofy
01:16:45 to being like
01:16:47 I want to like people were like
01:16:49 excited about the prospect of a
01:16:51 exclamation
01:16:53 question mark fuck command
01:16:55 where like consent
01:16:57 is not necessary
01:16:59 and somebody has to like sign up
01:17:01 for that treatment they have to
01:17:03 set race
01:17:05 sex object
01:17:07 set race sex object
01:17:09 and then people can
01:17:11 question mark fuck them at any time
01:17:13 and the flavor text
01:17:15 is like more
01:17:17 raunchy and sexual
01:17:19 and people are really into it and it's really funny
01:17:21 I like being a part of this
01:17:23 horny on main is like
01:17:25 actually cool
01:17:27 so if you
01:17:29 wanted to have the most sex
01:17:31 I assume you could just go where the sex objects are
01:17:33 and just like it would be like
01:17:35 exclamation point mining
01:17:37 exclamation point fuck them over and over again
01:17:39 you would and they also their number
01:17:41 would go up
01:17:43 okay if you want I mean listen
01:17:45 this broken game design right we need to
01:17:47 need to rebalance it needs a patch what you got
01:17:49 to do is you have to you have surely
01:17:51 you must have to like expend some kind of
01:17:53 resource while having sex like you must
01:17:55 you must have to like refill your
01:17:57 your testicles or whatever
01:17:59 whatever fuel it is that is
01:18:01 required right just so
01:18:03 the thing the thing
01:18:05 one or the other I mean I would
01:18:07 I was thinking of like adding
01:18:09 like a
01:18:11 penis size stat
01:18:13 somehow to the game that you could also
01:18:15 like
01:18:17 make bigger somehow
01:18:19 but I think
01:18:21 my thoughts initially
01:18:23 were like I don't want
01:18:25 people to be alienated
01:18:27 too much from
01:18:29 like okay like not everybody has
01:18:31 a penis there are actual girls in the
01:18:33 server
01:18:35 and they like if I
01:18:37 if the sex command includes
01:18:39 like
01:18:41 like mention of the penis
01:18:43 I was like that
01:18:45 that won't work that would be like
01:18:47 take you out of the experience
01:18:49 because a lot of the initial like commands
01:18:51 of the initial responses
01:18:53 for like question mark sex
01:18:55 and question mark accept is
01:18:57 you hold hands
01:18:59 or like you cuddle each other
01:19:01 and it's like whoa based
01:19:03 so lewd
01:19:05 and that was the joke
01:19:07 and then it just actually just became
01:19:09 fucking
01:19:11 but
01:19:13 you know
01:19:15 I could add penises in there
01:19:17 I think that would be a fun
01:19:19 extra thing like a little toggle
01:19:21 penis toggle
01:19:23 toggle have penis the thing is then
01:19:25 like if you don't have penis how do
01:19:27 you have sex is it
01:19:29 possible well I mean I'm sure
01:19:31 surely we can figure
01:19:33 something out
01:19:35 surely there must be some alternative
01:19:37 nipple pussy let's go
01:19:39 like what
01:19:41 is like what do the female
01:19:43 have they have the vagina but they
01:19:45 don't have little like nothing
01:19:47 nothing they have nothing else
01:19:49 everyone has a butt
01:19:51 it's true that you can expend
01:19:53 your butt resource he's right
01:19:55 you know okay
01:19:57 how can we solve
01:19:59 this problem of how to
01:20:01 have sex without penis
01:20:03 with regards to having
01:20:05 with regards to having
01:20:07 a resource specifically because like
01:20:09 I don't know
01:20:11 what do the lesbians do they just sort
01:20:13 of squidge together
01:20:15 they get maybe a dildo
01:20:17 a dildo
01:20:19 you just get a dildo you gotta
01:20:21 have a dildo I mean I guess in real life
01:20:23 the thing you're expending is like energy
01:20:25 because it's exhausting to do
01:20:27 so much of it to fuck
01:20:29 a thousand times a second
01:20:31 if you spam click
01:20:33 question mark fuck
01:20:35 over and over again
01:20:37 are people botting?
01:20:39 people aren't botting that
01:20:41 people are doing the
01:20:43 question mark squeeze to make their breasts bigger
01:20:45 in the titty bar
01:20:47 excellent good
01:20:49 but nobody's botting as far as I know
01:20:51 you could have like a libido
01:20:53 resource or something like that that's like a secondary
01:20:55 maybe I don't know if that would be good
01:20:57 I'm not a gay man
01:20:59 yes that that could work
01:21:01 so you can only sex when there's
01:21:03 libido is high enough
01:21:07 game mechanics
01:21:09 I guess it would like refill automatically but maybe
01:21:11 you can accelerate it by doing certain things
01:21:13 perhaps
01:21:15 yeah like chugging
01:21:17 libido pills
01:21:19 what are those things in like dojins
01:21:21 they always have where it's like I gave you
01:21:23 these secret pills that make you
01:21:25 want to have sex more
01:21:27 I gave you the penis having pills
01:21:29 no not those
01:21:31 those are different pills
01:21:33 they're like
01:21:35 they call them like aphrodisiacs that's the one
01:21:37 you chug aphrodisiacs
01:21:39 to get your libido back
01:21:41 so you can fuck more
01:21:47 and it's like I'm imagining like a black market
01:21:49 developing of like people
01:21:51 like it's a limited resource
01:21:53 and you have to like you have to work for it
01:21:55 you really gotta like what are you going to do for me
01:21:57 if I give you these aphrodisiacs like I just
01:21:59 I gotta have my fix because I want to fuck
01:22:01 maybe you could trade
01:22:03 like the estrogen pojins
01:22:05 for aphrodisiacs like if one person
01:22:07 wants to prioritize one over the other
01:22:09 yeah you could
01:22:11 maybe you could like transmogrify
01:22:13 an estrogen pojun into an aphrodisiacs
01:22:15 so you can decide to get bigger breasts
01:22:17 or you can get some stuff
01:22:19 to fuck more
01:22:21 choices this is good
01:22:23 like game design talk
01:22:27 you know what other game was designed
01:22:29 Minecraft
01:22:31 oh my god it was
01:22:33 hmm
01:22:35 they should add sex to Minecraft
01:22:37 um
01:22:39 wait they didn't
01:22:41 wait then who what have I been doing
01:22:43 like dude
01:22:45 you know you can put your Minecraft bed
01:22:47 next to someone else's bed
01:22:49 and then it becomes a big bed
01:22:51 oh does it actually become a big bed now
01:22:53 somebody
01:22:55 it just looks like it
01:22:57 somebody said like hey did you
01:22:59 see what happens when you use
01:23:01 sleep on Minecraft
01:23:03 I assume they mean like the jigglypuff sleep
01:23:05 yes he gets in a bed
01:23:07 oh well okay I thought that might be it
01:23:09 he puts down a bed and goes to bed
01:23:11 it goes to sleep when he jigglypuff
01:23:13 uh
01:23:15 sings at him which is funny
01:23:17 does he actually like put a bed down
01:23:19 or does he just become
01:23:21 he puts a bed down and gets in it
01:23:23 oh something
01:23:25 a secret Minecraft strat
01:23:27 that few people know about
01:23:29 that I discovered by accident and many of my friends
01:23:31 we don't use it for Minecraft sex but you could
01:23:33 in your options
01:23:35 you can actually you know how your Minecraft skin
01:23:37 has like an outer layer and an inner layer
01:23:41 have you ever mastered that before
01:23:43 don't really use it
01:23:45 because it never looks that good
01:23:47 basically your skin can have two layers to it
01:23:49 there's like an inner layer and an outer layer
01:23:51 if the outer layer can have transparency
01:23:53 it's usually used to like make hair stick out
01:23:55 slightly further or something like that
01:23:57 what you can do is in game
01:23:59 you can go to your options and you can actually turn off
01:24:01 the outer layers
01:24:03 so you could design your character to be
01:24:05 naked underneath and then put like clothes
01:24:07 on the outside
01:24:09 and then you could climb into bed with another
01:24:11 Minecraft player and go into your options
01:24:13 and just slowly turn the other layers off
01:24:15 it's doable
01:24:17 there would already be like
01:24:19 client side though they wouldn't know
01:24:21 oh no it works it works on servers
01:24:23 my friend made his head is a
01:24:25 giant like colon V looking thing
01:24:27 oh of course
01:24:29 occasionally he'll walk up to me and he'll just go
01:24:31 and his head turns black because he'll turn that off
01:24:33 and he does it to scare me
01:24:35 and it's actually scary
01:24:37 he scares me
01:24:39 yeah
01:24:41 that's cool
01:24:43 server side like you can see whenever people
01:24:45 turn their things on and off
01:24:47 guys here's a big question
01:24:53 when having sex in Minecraft
01:24:55 spherical boobs
01:24:57 or square boobs
01:25:01 that's tricky that's a tricky question
01:25:03 wait what say that again
01:25:05 when having sex in Minecraft
01:25:07 do you go for the
01:25:09 spherical boobs or the square boobs
01:25:13 the spherical out of this world
01:25:15 literally
01:25:17 I don't
01:25:19 I mean
01:25:21 where do I compare the two
01:25:23 the thing is with spherical boobs
01:25:25 they break the law of Minecraft
01:25:27 they cannot have curves in Minecraft
01:25:29 unacceptable
01:25:31 on the other hand square boobs
01:25:33 look stupid
01:25:35 and not attractive in any way
01:25:37 and it's really funny when people draw all have
01:25:39 like
01:25:41 some of the like Minecraft
01:25:43 source filmmaker porn
01:25:45 are you talking about a slippery tea
01:25:47 I don't know any of the things
01:25:49 I just know that they exist
01:25:51 I never looked at them
01:25:53 never
01:25:55 never looked at them recreationally
01:25:57 at least
01:26:01 it's just really funny seeing that
01:26:03 they animate these like
01:26:05 ooh so hot
01:26:07 and it's the Minecraft girl and she's got
01:26:09 like
01:26:11 cuboids coming out of her chest
01:26:13 and it's like oh yeah
01:26:15 cuboids like no it's stupid
01:26:17 um
01:26:19 I mean yeah it's stupid
01:26:21 but
01:26:23 everything is stupid
01:26:25 you know what you're right everything is stupid
01:26:27 I don't know why I have such a thing
01:26:29 against cuboid breasts
01:26:31 some of our listeners
01:26:33 might have cuboid breasts
01:26:35 and they will probably have their feelings
01:26:37 always
01:26:39 please don't cancel me
01:26:41 our Minecraft audience is going to be
01:26:43 uh it's going to be up in arms
01:26:45 oh no
01:26:47 they can be furious
01:26:49 I made
01:26:51 I made a tweet earlier
01:26:53 and I think it might have been misinterpreted
01:26:55 really
01:26:57 a tweet misinterpreted
01:26:59 maybe well I don't know
01:27:01 I'm not sure
01:27:03 I wrote I tried to join an org
01:27:05 last week and they straight up took my info
01:27:07 and never got back to me because this is a thing
01:27:09 I did
01:27:11 an org like an organization
01:27:13 like a mutual aid
01:27:15 not an orgie
01:27:17 see that's what I think some people might think that I meant
01:27:19 I think some people might think it was a typo
01:27:21 and I was saying that I tried to join an orgie
01:27:23 I did not
01:27:25 I did not
01:27:27 do that
01:27:29 there is a
01:27:31 I see these
01:27:33 signs on lawns around
01:27:35 in my neighborhood
01:27:37 for a thing called
01:27:39 sex
01:27:41 yeah it's called sex
01:27:43 and I thought hmm I should try it sometime
01:27:45 it is for
01:27:47 the organization is called
01:27:49 mutual aid
01:27:51 Medford and Somerville
01:27:53 because that's the area I live in
01:27:55 that
01:27:57 so it's a mutual aid org I guess
01:27:59 and I was like
01:28:01 I wonder what that is so when I looked at their website
01:28:03 and you know there was like a thing
01:28:05 you could fill out that's like what are you able
01:28:07 to contribute to like a community
01:28:09 fund and I was like well
01:28:11 it was things like you know can you like
01:28:13 babysit kids
01:28:15 can you you know like
01:28:17 deliver groceries to people can you like
01:28:19 contribute money can you like do tutoring
01:28:21 for people that like can't afford it
01:28:23 or whatever and I'm like well I don't have a car
01:28:25 so I can't transport stuff but I'd be willing
01:28:27 to like if someone
01:28:29 like like can't afford groceries I'd be willing
01:28:31 to like contribute to this fund
01:28:33 and maybe they like buy them groceries
01:28:35 I like I don't know if that's how it works but maybe
01:28:37 so I sent them an email I called them on the phone
01:28:39 I asked what to do they said
01:28:41 go to our website like we'll send you an email fill
01:28:43 out this thing like send send us
01:28:45 back to us and we will like contact you

01:28:55 my money I do want to like donate
01:28:57 money to you and why are you fucking up

01:29:05 Darren you should have tried
01:29:07 I just want to be
01:29:09 I just want to be in an

01:29:17 communist hail

01:29:25 in order to spread solidarity among the working

01:29:29 but it's hard
01:29:31 it's hard get back to me

01:29:35 tell me you want my money please
01:29:37 mutual aid Medford and Somerville
01:29:39 I'm ripe for it to be plucked
01:29:41 okay
01:29:43 I just had to complain about that
01:29:47 what's oblivion fall
01:29:49 you said that you like wrote down some like topics
01:29:51 right yeah I do
01:29:53 did you have some shit
01:29:55 I don't even know
01:29:57 we sort of talked about some of it already
01:29:59 there was like another thing
01:30:01 with the PCP references being hidden in things
01:30:03 one that I don't think
01:30:05 anyone knows about is
01:30:07 an heir to the come throne
01:30:09 which is the second comes on video
01:30:11 is that the one with the boobies
01:30:13 no that's the one with the dick masterson
01:30:15 yeah the dick masterson one
01:30:17 that's been seen by two million people
01:30:19 and those two million people
01:30:21 have unwittingly seen
01:30:23 horseshoe finale without realizing it now
01:30:25 why
01:30:27 how okay so
01:30:29 all the videos have a bit of like a psychedelic
01:30:31 backdrop to them right
01:30:33 you have a kaleidoscope effect yeah
01:30:35 and I took horseshoe finale
01:30:37 I sped it up really fast
01:30:39 and that's it
01:30:41 and that's what I did for the video
01:30:43 no shit
01:30:45 yeah every so often you'll see like an arm poke out
01:30:47 and it's just Jesse
01:30:49 well they haven't
01:30:51 you say they've, is it the whole video
01:30:53 just sped up yeah the entire video condensed
01:30:55 into like two minutes that's so fucking
01:30:57 funny okay
01:30:59 I see I see the hand
01:31:01 well the cool thing is like he has so many posters
01:31:03 around his room that like when the kaleidoscope
01:31:05 they look really cool
01:31:07 I just saw
01:31:09 a face there's a face
01:31:11 at um wait wait
01:31:13 who is at
01:31:15 one minute 18 seconds oh I
01:31:17 had like extra things in there as well like
01:31:19 okay there's just a still
01:31:21 image of somebody's face yeah I had Chris
01:31:23 Ray Gunn's face in there because he reacted to
01:31:25 the cumzone once also
01:31:27 Call Me Carson and
01:31:29 Mumki Jones a few random people I hid in there
01:31:31 because there are people who had like reacted to it before
01:31:33 and I was just referencing them but yeah
01:31:35 that that was a thing I wanted to mention
01:31:37 because it's PCP relevant it is
01:31:39 I can see the bookcase
01:31:41 yeah
01:31:43 uh yeah
01:31:45 I would never have noticed
01:31:47 in a million years but
01:31:49 it needs
01:31:51 the only other interesting thing I guess
01:31:53 is something like I guess
01:31:55 I discovered it recently or I rediscovered it
01:31:57 it's something I forgot or repressed I guess it was
01:31:59 uh an early
01:32:01 I don't know if you'd call this a red pill or a black pill but
01:32:03 um you know
01:32:05 like those TV interviews you see on the news
01:32:07 sometimes where like the news presenter
01:32:09 like who you see every week I mean
01:32:11 I say this I haven't watched the news in like 10 years
01:32:13 but they're like talking to someone on video
01:32:15 and like they're having a conversation back and forth
01:32:19 like in two
01:32:21 screens like yeah there's like two screens
01:32:23 like not like a reporter on the scene
01:32:25 like they'll be like interviewing like some person
01:32:27 or like some professional or something about like
01:32:29 a recent event maybe
01:32:31 sure yeah my mother was on one
01:32:33 of those news interviews ones and
01:32:35 you assume that what happens
01:32:37 is you know they just
01:32:39 set up a live feed and they have a conversation
01:32:41 but it's not what happens
01:32:43 so this was like probably
01:32:45 like 2004-2005 this happened
01:32:47 but uh the news crew came over to our
01:32:49 house the day before
01:32:51 they sat my mother down in a chair
01:32:53 and pointed a camera at her
01:32:55 and they had someone read the
01:32:57 questions and they recorded
01:32:59 her answers and then they packed up and left
01:33:01 the next day
01:33:03 the news presenter
01:33:05 read out similar questions
01:33:07 um and they and they
01:33:09 needed to have a conversation where if they played
01:33:11 the clips of my mother like
01:33:13 him talking back and forth and every time they needed
01:33:15 to make a cut they'd cut to just the news presenter
01:33:17 and then they'd cut back again um
01:33:19 so that way it was like this fake live
01:33:21 interview that was all staged
01:33:23 um and the questions were also
01:33:25 worded differently so that way like if it's
01:33:27 like a contentious political issue and they wanted
01:33:29 to look like oh you're dodging the question
01:33:31 they'll ask you a slightly different
01:33:33 question so that way it looks like you're not
01:33:35 answering or something
01:33:37 really that sucks
01:33:39 it does suck and even
01:33:41 worse version of this
01:33:43 happened to my dad
01:33:45 probably 2010
01:33:47 2011 around that time
01:33:49 it was a channel 9 interview so no one watched it
01:33:51 we only have like free channels
01:33:53 in New Zealand that people watch
01:33:55 but um this was like another like
01:33:57 political discussion about
01:33:59 something um and like
01:34:01 so my dad sits down it's like
01:34:03 it was like a Jordan Peterson style interview
01:34:05 was the one from a few years ago with the
01:34:07 the lobsters and shit something like that right
01:34:09 where you know oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:34:11 it's like two people like like they're sitting on
01:34:13 they're sitting like they have these little nice chairs
01:34:15 and there's like a table in between them and it's like
01:34:17 a back and forth they're in the same room right
01:34:19 is it the is it the it's an Asian
01:34:21 guy interviewing him and Jordan
01:34:23 talks about like like women in
01:34:25 like wearing lipstick and stuff is it that one
01:34:27 it was the one I mean the Jordan Peterson
01:34:29 style interview I'm thinking of is the one where he was
01:34:31 with the blonde woman and
01:34:33 I don't know I don't know if I've seen
01:34:35 I don't know it was like there's a few years ago
01:34:37 people memed it a bunch I saw a bit of it
01:34:39 but yeah imagine interviews sort of
01:34:41 like that where it's like two people in a room
01:34:43 and there's like a table between them and they're just talking
01:34:45 um you know shot reverse shot camera
01:34:47 so my dad
01:34:49 goes in the lady shakes its hand
01:34:51 and they sit down and they're like all right you know nice
01:34:53 to meet you okay now we're gonna go through the questions
01:34:55 and immediately the lady
01:34:57 starts screaming like
01:34:59 very angry like oh how dare
01:35:01 you think this opinion what do you think about this
01:35:03 you idiot you you hate
01:35:05 women you you know you know whatever like whatever
01:35:07 the discussion is like throwing and hurling
01:35:09 insults yelling being aggressive
01:35:11 and my dad is like flushes like he's like taken
01:35:13 him back like whoa what the what the what the fuck is this
01:35:15 um and then he like you know he
01:35:17 loses his composure but you know he tries to answer
01:35:19 the question as best he can and the lady
01:35:21 so so it's not not the interviewer
01:35:23 it's like the person who's like interpreting
01:35:25 the interview questions for well no this time
01:35:27 it was the actual interviewer in this
01:35:29 occasion okay um the last time they sent
01:35:31 someone over to my family's house is a proxy this
01:35:33 time my dad was in the studio with the actual
01:35:35 person and so this interviewer lady
01:35:37 was being super aggressive and yelling
01:35:39 and you can see that my dad is
01:35:41 a little bit flustered um
01:35:43 you know he looks a little bit taken aback
01:35:45 but he answers her questions and I assume
01:35:47 he did a good job and then after they're
01:35:49 done like she immediately
01:35:51 like a switch she's calm again she's like all right
01:35:53 you know thank you for the interview and as my
01:35:55 dad's leaving he turns around
01:35:57 he sees the lady sit back down and they
01:35:59 record her asking the questions again
01:36:01 but this time really calm and polite
01:36:03 Jesus so
01:36:05 when you see it on the
01:36:07 on the TV it's like she's talking
01:36:09 it's crazy that that they would do it
01:36:11 just right there in front of it yeah
01:36:13 they wouldn't even try to hide that from him
01:36:15 that's no I guess I guess
01:36:17 this is a routine no they can get away with it
01:36:19 fuck yeah and so when you see it on
01:36:21 television she's all calm and polite
01:36:23 and my dad's looking all flustered and it's like
01:36:25 this idiot it's like
01:36:27 damn what did she want to like get him for
01:36:29 uh there's talking about
01:36:31 some thing I don't remember what
01:36:33 it was it was
01:36:35 my dad was a controversial figure he's like a
01:36:37 philosopher guy he's got a phd
01:36:39 um and like moral
01:36:41 ethics and they were talking about some like ethical thing
01:36:43 it might have been related
01:36:45 to euthanasia or like
01:36:47 I don't know something
01:36:49 okay sure but uh yeah
01:36:51 and uh
01:36:53 obviously these clips they're on the internet
01:36:55 yeah like you can't
01:36:57 find them like no one fucking watches channel 9
01:36:59 but yeah
01:37:01 my dad told me about it and I was like that's fucked dude
01:37:05 uh that reminds
01:37:07 me
01:37:09 I mean uh makes me wonder about
01:37:11 that thing I don't know if you happen
01:37:13 to see that that Nancy Pelosi
01:37:15 clip from like a couple weeks ago
01:37:17 I don't know it's been floating
01:37:19 there's a there was a someone
01:37:21 was in it was talking to Nancy Pelosi
01:37:23 on the um
01:37:25 I don't fucking know what network
01:37:27 but they asked they asked her a question
01:37:29 and she's just like
01:37:31 stares like I know there can be like a
01:37:33 delay or something oh right
01:37:35 yes and she just stares for they ask
01:37:37 her a question and she's like
01:37:39 good morning good morning it's Sunday
01:37:41 Sunday yeah no no no it was weird
01:37:43 good morning Sunday morning
01:37:47 so I mean the program I don't know
01:37:49 I guess that makes it well
01:37:51 maybe some weird shit happened and it
01:37:53 made sense at the time and it wasn't just
01:37:55 like her going senile or something yeah
01:37:57 we'll never know like we'll never know
01:37:59 you never know like obviously some of the conversations
01:38:01 you see on TV have to be real like when they're
01:38:03 having like proper arguments and stuff like some
01:38:05 of it has to be live but I wonder how much
01:38:07 of it is like just pre-recorded
01:38:09 where they've like manipulated it in some way
01:38:11 yeah
01:38:13 because that happened both time my parents
01:38:15 were on like TV for stuff like this
01:38:17 and like that's just New Zealand
01:38:19 you know and the techniques
01:38:21 have advanced it's been like over 10 years
01:38:29 it's kind of cool it's kind of cool to imagine
01:38:31 it like I don't know
01:38:33 I don't know what you said before about how everyone knows each other
01:38:35 so like
01:38:37 it's not that uncommon to just end up on TV
01:38:39 well yeah but
01:38:41 you all kind of like know everyone or know
01:38:43 someone who knows everyone
01:38:45 has at least one relative or friend of a relative
01:38:47 who was in Lord of the Rings
01:38:49 right like you were an extra
01:38:51 you helped make like the armor for the orcs
01:38:53 or you were a fucking like animator
01:38:55 like I um one of my best friends
01:38:57 growing up his aunt
01:38:59 like animated the spiders
01:39:01 in the Hobbit movies and she recommended me
01:39:03 to go to a certain school that she went to and I went there
01:39:05 yeah and when I was
01:39:07 yeah and when I was there like some guy from Weta
01:39:09 like came over and was like hey guys here's how we made
01:39:11 a Abraham Lincoln vampire
01:39:13 hunter and I don't know
01:39:15 give some presentation
01:39:17 how strange
01:39:19 yeah I remember
01:39:21 do you remember
01:39:23 or have seen the um
01:39:25 the Lindsay Ellis trilogy
01:39:27 of the Hobbit movies
01:39:29 and how the
01:39:31 like they
01:39:33 have fucked a lot with
01:39:35 the workers rights of New Zealand
01:39:37 errs
01:39:39 yeah I did watch that
01:39:41 I didn't know about that until I saw her video
01:39:43 and I was like fuck that's
01:39:45 that's stupid
01:39:47 they're really good videos and I can't remember
01:39:49 the points so I can't regurgitate them for the PCP
01:39:51 they're pretty long
01:39:53 and they're pretty yeah
01:39:55 I remember hearing a little bit about it
01:39:57 at the time it's like people the New Zealanders
01:39:59 like Lord of the Rings
01:40:01 is extremely like tied to like
01:40:03 like I guess national
01:40:05 identity in a certain way we have very few
01:40:07 things we're allowed to be proud of
01:40:09 it's like being proud of your country
01:40:11 a stupid cringe
01:40:13 unless it's rugby or Lord of the Rings
01:40:15 or Flight of a Concord I guess
01:40:17 you're not allowed to be proud of your country because that's bad
01:40:19 bad New Zealander
01:40:21 they were talking about
01:40:23 they were talking about
01:40:25 they were talking about filming it
01:40:27 and like somewhere else
01:40:29 and everyone's like no no you have to keep it here
01:40:31 we need it for vatorism and stuff
01:40:33 yeah it was basically like
01:40:35 like a
01:40:37 like a monopoly thing like
01:40:39 either you
01:40:41 either you sweeten this deal
01:40:43 by like undercutting
01:40:45 workers union rights or whatever
01:40:47 so we can film here for cheaper
01:40:49 or we'll just film it somewhere else
01:40:51 and of course a lot of a country
01:40:53 is the like 5 second explanation of it
01:40:55 yeah pretty much it's like do you want the film
01:40:57 here or do you want workers rights
01:40:59 and people voted no workers rights
01:41:01 that sucks
01:41:03 yeah we want
01:41:05 it to make sense right if it's like
01:41:07 a big part of the frickin
01:41:09 I don't know New Zealand economy
01:41:11 is like Lord of the Rings
01:41:13 and then
01:41:15 and then it was and then it's such a shame
01:41:17 that these movies weren't even good
01:41:19 yeah they sucked they were awful
01:41:21 Peter Jackson got fucked
01:41:23 they didn't give him any time
01:41:25 to do the first one
01:41:27 I was watching
01:41:29 the behind the scenes videos
01:41:31 with Peter Jackson working on the movie
01:41:33 as they were as the last
01:41:35 as they're working on the last one they're like
01:41:37 yeah we're gonna have like a free
01:41:39 months of crunch time at the end or something
01:41:41 like that and I'm like free months
01:41:43 like I can barely handle a week for my projects
01:41:45 and I almost
01:41:47 like if I had done
01:41:49 what my parents wanted me to do I would have
01:41:51 probably been working on those fucking movies
01:41:53 like at least for the last one
01:41:55 because I had like connections there
01:41:57 and I'd gone to the same school that the other person
01:41:59 went to like I could have applied but
01:42:01 I decided to do internet shit instead
01:42:03 hooray
01:42:05 sorry
01:42:07 no it's good
01:42:09 that's how I came to America it's epic
01:42:11 oh that is pretty epic
01:42:13 I'm actually earning more money than I would
01:42:15 if I had gotten a job there so
01:42:17 it's fine
01:42:19 wow just from internet stuff
01:42:21 yeah like two big
01:42:23 two big youtube channels
01:42:25 simultaneously it's good
01:42:27 you get some
01:42:29 do you mind me asking about your
01:42:31 payment models or whatever do you get paid
01:42:33 like per project do you make like a salary
01:42:35 um it's salary
01:42:37 times two actually right now
01:42:39 because there's da games
01:42:41 and there's pencilmation which
01:42:43 huge channel like 17
01:42:45 million subscribers they were in youtube rewind
01:42:47 last year they got like
01:42:49 I think they were in for the number free most viewed
01:42:51 youtube channel of 2019
01:42:53 crazy
01:42:55 yeah like every video gets like tens of millions of views
01:42:57 pretty much and they make like free
01:42:59 a week um I put some
01:43:01 pcp references in there too but they're
01:43:03 really subtle I have to be sneaky about it
01:43:05 ooh I haven't heard
01:43:07 of pencilmation references
01:43:09 I know you did pencilmation
01:43:11 I saw a few episodes
01:43:13 um I
01:43:15 I posted them in your chat
01:43:17 uh Gib at a certain point like
01:43:19 when they came out um I don't have the
01:43:21 screenshots on me right now usually it's like
01:43:23 for like one frame during an explosion
01:43:25 like I'll make a certain piece of the cloud
01:43:27 into the like brop face
01:43:29 that was one I did um
01:43:31 and there's one where there's like an abstract
01:43:33 painting on the wall and I again changed
01:43:35 it to look like the brop face like I just
01:43:37 kind of changed the
01:43:39 so it's just a bunch it's just a bunch of brop
01:43:41 references mostly that
01:43:43 it's I love it for one so
01:43:45 easy to hide it's so versatile yeah
01:43:47 yeah yeah I could see that
01:43:49 it's such a simple like little shape with
01:43:51 more specific pcp stuff like
01:43:53 next time there's an explosion could you maybe have
01:43:55 that spell out like patreon.com
01:43:57 I think
01:43:59 one of the supervisors would notice if I did
01:44:01 that
01:44:03 I don't like the thing is I don't animate
01:44:05 the episodes but I kind of
01:44:07 supervise every single stage like from
01:44:09 storyboard to color to like
01:44:11 through animation and I do like some
01:44:13 re-timing editing and um
01:44:15 so you can sneak a little thing in the background
01:44:17 I have accessed all the files yeah so like
01:44:19 when the animator finishes and sends me the file
01:44:21 I can go in and like tweak stuff and I do
01:44:23 because I usually there's certain problems that
01:44:25 sometimes maybe the animators
01:44:27 didn't do a good job fixing it so I'll go and fix
01:44:29 it maybe there's like a coloring error and I'll fix
01:44:31 that or and while I'm doing
01:44:33 that I can like hide in little references
01:44:35 one of my favorites is it's an episode
01:44:37 that my friend made did
01:44:39 I don't know what it's called on YouTube but the
01:44:41 production code was p migration
01:44:43 there's a TV static
01:44:45 and the TV static
01:44:47 is the pcp theme
01:44:49 audio wave just running by
01:44:51 really quickly
01:44:53 I'll put it
01:44:55 in the show notes you won't see it like you can listen
01:44:57 to it or is it just like visual audio
01:44:59 no like I opened it on audacity
01:45:01 and I took a screenshot of the audio
01:45:03 wave form and then I loaded it into
01:45:05 flash and I converted it
01:45:07 I right I converted there's
01:45:09 an option called trace bitmap that converts
01:45:11 the bitmap into a vector image
01:45:13 and then I like colored it like TV static colors
01:45:15 and yeah that's that's in there
01:45:17 it's like the most subtle reference ever
01:45:19 but wonder if somebody
01:45:21 could like reverse engineer that way
01:45:23 how could you possibly even know
01:45:25 I'll get a
01:45:27 screenshot it might take me a minute but you'll see
01:45:29 it in a bit I know that
01:45:31 wave form anywhere
01:45:33 yeah I see
01:45:35 it in my dreams actually I'll just
01:45:37 link the video of the timestamp and then you'll know
01:45:41 but based
01:45:43 on that
01:45:47 it's so cool that like
01:45:49 people we know are so much cooler
01:45:51 than us
01:45:53 yeah agreed
01:45:55 I'm not I'm not cool as a person
01:45:57 I just work on cool things
01:45:59 that's cool that makes you
01:46:01 cool
01:46:05 no you made a video about
01:46:07 come and you got 60 million views
01:46:09 I'm the only cool one
01:46:11 actually when you really think about it
01:46:13 well good thing I don't think
01:46:15 good thing I have no brain
01:46:17 yeah yeah
01:46:19 yeah
01:46:21 okay
01:46:23 there's a there's a timestamp the TV
01:46:25 static when he changes the channel
01:46:27 I think that's the way form there are a few
01:46:29 different way forms I think that last one was
01:46:31 the PCP theme but yeah
01:46:33 oh yeah yeah that in the TV
01:46:35 when it's static II yeah
01:46:37 string yeah I see it
01:46:39 I see it
01:46:41 that's
01:46:43 so
01:46:45 like
01:46:47 no one would ever know
01:46:49 that's the fun thing about it is I know
01:46:51 and no one else does until I tell them
01:46:53 yeah
01:46:55 pencil mate's great escape
01:46:57 from the cold
01:46:59 what is pencil mate is
01:47:01 just kind of like just kind of goofy cartoons
01:47:03 right it's goofy cartoons
01:47:05 especially for the recent episodes
01:47:07 the animation is actually really really good
01:47:09 like we hire
01:47:11 like we try to like
01:47:13 hire big name animators sometimes we've had
01:47:15 like 70 episodes done by Zurell
01:47:17 who's like a huge like
01:47:19 newgrounds animator I love that
01:47:21 guy's smooth animation
01:47:23 I've directed him on like a bunch of episodes
01:47:25 like he worked for me
01:47:27 and he's super chill
01:47:29 Zurell is
01:47:31 how do you spell that
01:47:33 Z E U R E L
01:47:35 yeah
01:47:37 that's the angel from Evangelion
01:47:39 but misspelled
01:47:41 true story
01:47:43 the animator for this episode
01:47:45 that I linked is made
01:47:47 who's one of my best friends
01:47:49 and he used to be a pony boy
01:47:51 he did some pony animations
01:47:53 and he talked to Jesse a few times actually
01:47:55 at a certain point
01:47:57 pony animation
01:47:59 imagine
01:48:01 whoa he spoke to Jesse
01:48:03 there's a PCP connection
01:48:05 and that's cool
01:48:07 well
01:48:09 I'm looking at Zurell
01:48:11 I'm trying to think what was the first
01:48:13 oh it was Sanfages
01:48:15 nine years ago god
01:48:17 that was the first one
01:48:19 Sanfages 30
01:48:21 I think it was the Pinkie Pie Cupcake song

01:51:49 like you're listening to a song and you just hear
01:51:51 a big reverb
01:51:53 in the background
01:51:55 there's probably like halloween themed songs

01:52:31 three two one go
01:52:33 so like
01:52:35 I was with my co-worker the other day
01:52:37 and I
01:52:39 dead ass used the phrase
01:52:41 my co-co-ro wish
01:52:43 without even thinking without even hesitating
01:52:45 I said that
01:52:47 in real life
01:52:49 to someone who is basically
01:52:51 internet virgin
01:52:53 and I 100% blame ben saint
01:52:55 for that and I want ben to atone
01:52:57 for his sins
01:52:59 for making me say co-co-ro wish
01:53:01 in real life
01:53:03 it's his fault
01:53:05 it's all of your faults
01:53:07 so I expect
01:53:09 compensation thank you very much
01:53:11 keep making this podcast
01:53:13 because if you don't I will actually
01:53:15 kill myself
01:53:17 don't do that
01:53:19 that's cringe
01:53:21 except
01:53:23 god damn I'm
01:53:25 so cringe
01:53:27 he admits it
01:53:29 just say co-co-ro wish
01:53:31 more people need to say it
01:53:33 he thought he was cringe for saying it
01:53:35 I normalize saying co-co-ro wish
01:53:37 I think it's more cringe
01:53:39 than the other things he said
01:53:41 co-co-ro wish is the only thing that was cool
01:53:43 he was just being cool
01:53:47 what else
01:53:49 what did you do that was cringe
01:53:51 I felt bad about saying co-co-ro wish
01:53:53 and then he said he was going to kill himself
01:53:55 if we stop making the podcast
01:53:57 that's fucking cringe
01:53:59 yeah you're absolutely right
01:54:01 next one is called
01:54:03 please help me
01:54:05 alright let's see
01:54:07 about four months ago
01:54:09 I discovered a youtuber
01:54:11 by the name of totally not mark
01:54:13 he then
01:54:15 decided to start reviewing One Piece
01:54:17 so I started reading One Piece
01:54:19 then youtube's algorithm
01:54:21 recommended to me
01:54:23 almost four hour long lecture
01:54:25 about One Piece
01:54:27 and that was
01:54:29 you guys
01:54:31 and then I said right
01:54:33 I watched every other lecture
01:54:35 from PCP University
01:54:37 based
01:54:39 I've listened to many of your podcasts
01:54:41 you've essentially ruined
01:54:43 my life because
01:54:45 I just
01:54:47 love listening to you assholes
01:54:49 talk about nothing
01:54:51 and I've started using based and cringe
01:54:53 and just so many other
01:54:55 things in my day to day life
01:54:57 I've alienated myself from my friends
01:54:59 and family
01:55:01 I have no one who understands
01:55:03 why
01:55:05 son of a shoe is cringe
01:55:07 I have no one who understands
01:55:09 why surskit is based
01:55:11 I've never even read fucking homestuck
01:55:13 and I know everything about homestuck
01:55:15 because of you people
01:55:17 you've ruined my life
01:55:19 and it's up to you guys to
01:55:21 to fix it
01:55:23 unruined my life
01:55:25 I have no social connections anymore
01:55:27 I spend all my time waiting
01:55:29 until it gets trolled
01:55:31 and hundreds of dollars
01:55:33 on Animorphs books
01:55:35 no
01:55:37 it just cuts off
01:55:39 it's the end
01:55:41 you know alright
01:55:43 there's an added layer
01:55:45 of interest to that
01:55:47 totally not mark
01:55:49 is a guy
01:55:51 who nexus mania edits for
01:55:53 nexus mania friend of the show
01:55:57 who has drawn a
01:55:59 vape red in your vapers 2 book
01:56:01 yes he did
01:56:03 so everything's connected
01:56:05 nexus mania now he's kai jukun
01:56:07 right that's his new handle
01:56:09 is that allowed
01:56:11 I didn't even know that
01:56:13 yeah
01:56:15 he changed his handle he commented on the last video
01:56:17 because he left a voicemail
01:56:19 yeah he's kai jukun
01:56:21 interesting
01:56:23 but that's serendipitous
01:56:25 sounds familiar
01:56:27 strange this is what happens
01:56:29 when you're a big youtuber
01:56:31 like us you get connected
01:56:33 you're in with the elites
01:56:35 it's funny we're like the most
01:56:37 connected least viewed
01:56:39 group of internet creators ever
01:56:41 I wonder
01:56:43 I don't know
01:56:45 I feel like our connections go a lot
01:56:47 further than our podcast
01:56:49 at least
01:56:51 would suggest
01:56:53 I feel
01:56:55 like you're right
01:56:57 I feel like you're right about that
01:56:59 but also do you think that a lot of big
01:57:01 youtubers exist completely
01:57:03 in isolation and don't have
01:57:05 any connection to anyone
01:57:07 yeah they probably talk to each other
01:57:09 all the time
01:57:11 I would imagine most of them probably know a few
01:57:13 I guess in regards to
01:57:15 the ratio of bigness versus connectedness
01:57:17 you're pretty good
01:57:19 yeah
01:57:21 which sucks I'd rather it be the other way around
01:57:23 I did stumble across a podcast once
01:57:25 which was like a bunch of big
01:57:27 Disney animators and people
01:57:29 and they were getting like 100 views
01:57:31 an episode
01:57:33 and they were quoting the PCP
01:57:35 and like saying
01:57:37 just be cool
01:57:39 you know what Dinsney
01:57:41 is actually cringe
01:57:43 and they said
01:57:45 that because of us
01:57:47 saying it because we invented those words
01:57:49 after he dropped out
01:57:51 but Bernie was doing streams
01:57:53 and he was getting like 300 concurrent viewers
01:57:55 which is like
01:57:57 I've had more than that before
01:57:59 so it's like
01:58:01 was he playing
01:58:03 yeah
01:58:05 Minecraft obviously
01:58:07 we have to build a better society
01:58:09 in Minecraft
01:58:11 I'm gonna build a better society in Minecraft
01:58:13 show you how it's done
01:58:15 that's
01:58:17 terrible for impression

01:58:23 boiny sanders
01:58:25 it's me bernie sanders

01:59:01 please discuss thank you
01:59:03 jesus
01:59:05 jesus christ
01:59:07 I don't know I would be like chippers
01:59:09 the fish and chip restaurant
01:59:11 dairy queen because
01:59:13 big booby
01:59:15 yeah that's pretty good
01:59:17 poggers uh I guess I would be
01:59:19 longhorn steakhouse
01:59:21 because I like me
01:59:23 stupid
01:59:25 fuck you is the answer to this question
01:59:27 I would be Aldi
01:59:29 I'm fucking Aldi
01:59:31 it's not a restaurant
01:59:33 it's not fast food but that's because I'm too
01:59:35 I don't I'm like the
01:59:37 instead of going to fast food
01:59:39 I just go and I buy some raw avocados
01:59:41 for 98 cents a piece and I just eat them whole
01:59:43 I mean that's pretty fast
01:59:45 yeah it's
01:59:47 faster if you know what you're doing
01:59:49 if you're trying to speed run
01:59:51 real answer water burger
01:59:53 because what is a burger
01:59:55 there you go
01:59:57 I've never had a water burger it's good I like it a lot
01:59:59 they got good fries
02:00:01 water burger gate
02:00:03 you ever had five guys
02:00:05 I have it tasted like home cooking
02:00:07 as in
02:00:09 when I make it at home it's bad
02:00:11 but it was okay
02:00:13 it's fair it's fair
02:00:15 a blast from the past
02:00:17 chip
02:00:19 on the subject of pornography that I will
02:00:21 have been talking about for the last two episodes
02:00:23 of the procrastinator's podcast
02:00:25 I Oliver Cromwell
02:00:27 as the long dead ancestor of one Mr. Gibbenteek
02:00:29 would like to speak up about the subject
02:00:31 what the hell accent is this
02:00:33 the fact that the wall sees pornography
02:00:35 as something that's okay to exist in the world
02:00:37 at all is a telltale sign
02:00:39 of its corruption on our own natures
02:00:41 now I'm also
02:00:43 close to realising
02:00:45 the runes affects the porn half
02:00:47 on the soul of every living man and a woman
02:00:49 whether they want to partake in it or not
02:00:51 through the example of jaden animations
02:00:53 but thou have us not
02:00:55 realized
02:00:57 I can only pray to God
02:00:59 that he will shine his light upon my faces
02:01:03 oh well I'm off the chop off king Charles's head now
02:01:05 have a good day
02:01:07 I feel stupid
02:01:09 because I kind of missed
02:01:11 Gaby with you
02:01:13 reverend
02:01:15 I kind of missed the
02:01:17 crux of that the main point of that
02:01:19 is saying something about jaden animations
02:01:21 it was something about the jaden animations thing
02:01:23 we got on a whole big
02:01:25 thing about it
02:01:27 yeah the thing about
02:01:29 whether it's okay to draw porn of jaden animations
02:01:31 answer yes
02:01:33 my take is
02:01:35 not a good look
02:01:37 but you do you
02:01:39 I know one of the artists who did that
02:01:41 why is it a bad look
02:01:43 why is it a worse look
02:01:45 than porn of anyone else
02:01:47 because
02:01:49 jaden won't like it and then she won't like you
02:01:51 and if you don't want that to happen
02:01:53 don't
02:01:55 I guess
02:01:57 kind of think if she doesn't like it that's her problem
02:01:59 I know but I guess if you care about her
02:02:01 opinion
02:02:03 I think what it is
02:02:05 there's an implied caring about
02:02:07 jaden animations if you are to draw
02:02:09 porn of her you probably care about her
02:02:11 or like her content or know about her in any way
02:02:13 and so there's
02:02:15 an implication that you don't want to piss her off
02:02:17 or make her hate you
02:02:19 that's why it's bad
02:02:21 I know who do a bunch of stuff
02:02:23 their
02:02:25 kind of thing is they just think that the character design
02:02:27 is really cute and they don't really
02:02:29 have attention to jaden himself at all
02:02:31 so like there's not necessarily any
02:02:33 problem
02:02:35 for the artist
02:02:37 they're like looting
02:02:39 really cute simple character designs
02:02:41 and they drew a bunch of stuff
02:02:43 and art is pretty good
02:02:45 I'll say
02:02:47 the reason I was conflicted in the first place
02:02:49 was because the art I had found
02:02:51 was very good and I was like damn
02:02:53 I don't know whether I'm allowed
02:02:55 but then again nobody cares
02:02:57 really nobody's watching me or judging me
02:02:59 so it's like I guess it doesn't really matter
02:03:03 yeah that's my take
02:03:05 that's my take as well
02:03:07 hey we got another one
02:03:09 fuck
02:03:11 the forbidden
02:03:15 good day and good tidings
02:03:17 gentlemen
02:03:19 today we hear a tale
02:03:21 as old as time
02:03:23 once more repeated
02:03:25 and not too long ago
02:03:27 within a cave that stretches
02:03:29 deep below the surface
02:03:31 into the crust of the earth
02:03:33 there lie a book
02:03:35 of legend
02:03:37 it was known in centuries past
02:03:39 as the necronomicon
02:03:41 book of the dead
02:03:43 and so it was
02:03:45 that an unlikely party of four
02:03:47 only two nights ago
02:03:49 would gather around the grave
02:03:51 of a fallen warlord
02:03:53 clutching that
02:03:55 olden text bound by human flesh
02:03:57 did they speak words
02:03:59 stricken from the Latin tongue
02:04:01 long ago
02:04:03 and the wind did cease
02:04:05 and the night before silent
02:04:07 there came a rumbling
02:04:09 as a hand rose from that grave
02:04:11 and a feared voice
02:04:13 once more did speak
02:04:15 go
02:04:17 no
02:04:19 no
02:04:21 no
02:04:23 return of samurai scroll
02:04:25 okay
02:04:27 until next time
02:04:29 sayonara
02:04:31 he got us, he's very good
02:04:33 that samurai
02:04:35 I'm like two episodes behind
02:04:37 is this still going on every episode
02:04:39 yes
02:04:41 he's such a trickster god
02:04:43 oh
02:04:47 oh my god
02:04:49 that was impressive
02:04:51 I don't know what he needs the scrolls for
02:04:53 when he's got the necronomicon
02:04:55 but
02:04:57 here's why
02:04:59 books and you scrolls old
02:05:01 old new good bad, there you go
02:05:03 oh yeah
02:05:05 scrolls much older, much better
02:05:07 necronomist scrolls
02:05:09 we got more voicemails
02:05:11 hall was way better than nirvana
02:05:13 okay
02:05:41 not a roughing material

02:07:01 and there's no repercussions
02:07:03 for my sins
02:07:05 the best i can do now is to go into a room alone
02:07:07 and whip myself with cat tails
02:07:09 so
02:07:11 i'd like to

02:07:29 and then immediately messaged nate
02:07:31 and said stop delete it please
02:07:33 it's like
02:07:35 it's a good thing
02:07:37 i wasn't in charge at the time
02:07:39 because

02:07:43 i don't negotiate with terrorists
02:07:45 absolutely not
02:07:47 oh god
02:07:49 it's just like when you have a big coom

02:08:29 i'm like i'm empathizing
02:08:31 i'm not convinced
02:08:33 i think he's just clapping his cheeks
02:08:35 i need some video evidence
02:08:37 show me the scars
02:08:39 wanna see him clap those cheeks
02:08:41 i mean that too
02:08:43 everyone's fine
02:08:45 we need video evidence
02:08:47 of something else
02:08:49 something whatever it is
02:08:51 either way we wanna see it
02:08:53 we're hungry for anything
02:08:55 next one
02:08:57 aka the untitled abridger
02:08:59 all right if donald trump
02:09:01 dies of covid does that mean i don't
02:09:03 have to vote for biden anymore
02:09:05 oh yeah that's a thing
02:09:07 they'll just run pence
02:09:09 but i mean
02:09:11 he won't win
02:09:13 i don't know kinda
02:09:15 i guess
02:09:17 they'll just keep trump alive in a robot body
02:09:19 it'll be like
02:09:21 future armor
02:09:23 put his head in a jar
02:09:25 i think they've made that technology right now
02:09:27 and then he'll be president forever
02:09:29 um i mean
02:09:31 that's literally already the case
02:09:35 well the head in the jar thing
02:09:37 no him being a robot i mean
02:09:39 i don't know it's pretty real to me
02:09:41 did you see
02:09:43 okay there was a picture
02:09:45 of him i guess at the debate
02:09:47 and like you see him from the side
02:09:49 and like there's like a part in his hair
02:09:51 on the side of his head
02:09:53 and like there's a piece
02:09:55 of his head that looks weird almost like it's made of
02:09:57 like metal or something
02:09:59 um wait
02:10:01 i want to see the image because i don't know what you mean
02:10:03 i want to see if i can
02:10:05 if i can i find the
02:10:09 it was floating around twitter
02:10:11 the other day
02:10:13 it was just like a weird
02:10:15 i don't
02:10:17 i never i didn't find any like
02:10:19 explanation
02:10:21 for what it is
02:10:23 i'd love for the image
02:10:25 to be like an obvious
02:10:27 photoshop of him with like a like a nuclear
02:10:29 rocket
02:10:31 stuck to his head or something
02:10:33 no it's it's like um
02:10:35 it was like a patch of some
02:10:37 like didn't really look like metal it was kind of brownish
02:10:39 just looked like solid like plastic
02:10:41 maybe it didn't have any like details
02:10:43 on it
02:10:45 but it was like just the
02:10:47 fuck i can't find it and i don't know what to google
02:10:49 in order to find it maybe that's his brain handle
02:10:53 i don't know
02:10:55 it's it's it's your brain force
02:10:57 you turn the thing and you speak
02:11:03 trump
02:11:05 head implant will i find anything there it is
02:11:07 whoa here it is head implant
02:11:09 okay this this is just a detail
02:11:11 photo
02:11:13 but um copy image
02:11:15 this is what it looked like
02:11:18 okay it seems like it might be
02:11:23 well yeah it doesn't seem like
02:11:25 anyone really figured it out but it might be a bone
02:11:27 like a bone implant hearing aid of
02:11:29 some kind
02:11:31 he's an old man maybe a hearing aid
02:11:33 i don't know what that is that does look
02:11:35 like a cyborg like
02:11:37 like iron hatch that you open
02:11:39 and like plug the
02:11:41 it looks like you could like open it up
02:11:43 and there's like a little plug
02:11:45 but it looks yeah it looks
02:11:47 like bone it looks it looks very unpleasant
02:11:49 looking i don't like it
02:11:51 but like yeah in
02:11:53 in in humans is
02:11:55 fucking it
02:11:57 yeah this is like the least
02:11:59 flattering image of a person you could ever have
02:12:01 is like the ear center stage
02:12:03 just the corner of the eye off the side
02:12:07 it is it's gross
02:12:09 it's gross to be a brain in a skeleton
02:12:11 in a flesh body
02:12:13 uh
02:12:15 yeah bone implant hearing aids seems to
02:12:17 be a pretty adequate explanation
02:12:19 that's that's that's what i'm going to go
02:12:21 with uh for the time- okay so mystery
02:12:23 solved but uh
02:12:25 yeah but gross but he's already a cyborg
02:12:27 so you're correct
02:12:29 lol
02:12:31 okay and next the voicemail
02:12:33 notsamurai.m bracelet
02:12:35 Really?
02:12:37 Sceptical To Say The least
02:12:39 I
02:12:43 Don't know man. I I enjoy what's going on right now. It's here. It's nice to hear you and
02:12:49 Tom talk about your things once in a week, but I don't know. I feel like y'all are trying to kill PCV as a brand
02:12:55 by continuing forward can't hint
02:12:59 maybe because of the cumulative drama of
02:13:02 Everything, you know, Jesse ragequitted DeVue dropped off the face of the earth. I'm key monkey seven years ago face of the earth
02:13:10 Mage went to dreamland and munchie became
02:13:17 They you know y'all have a new show I don't like anime though. I don't I like y'all personalities. I grew up with y'all
02:13:25 Kind of in a way over a couple years
02:13:28 You know and I didn't get it. I didn't get munchies or Jesse's humor
02:13:33 I do now I used to cringe at digi, but you know, I
02:13:38 Appreciate her for her willingness to defend her principles on free speech, you know, I feel like you guys were my friends and
02:13:48 Hearing what
02:13:50 Me and probably the rest of us as the end of an era
02:13:54 It's a little bit sad
02:13:56 All right, sure. It's coming out a weird time too. I have a one-year-old son and a wife and
02:14:04 Think I've ever have these things when I clicked on science you 101
02:14:11 You have them now you're welcome
02:14:13 I guess I did and that's what's happened and it's time-passing
02:14:20 That's it man
02:14:22 Yeah, sounds like it
02:14:24 Well, I mean you can mourn like the past, but I thought I thought I really thought there was gonna be a punchline
02:14:30 Yeah, I was thinking that but like he kept going. I mean sure like the the end of an era
02:14:37 It's sad like people feel it sad. I
02:14:41 I can't like
02:14:43 Worry about that in the same way that other people do and also, you know, we were never your friends. That's the first
02:14:50 Yeah, it's it's it was it we made like we did have discussions about like the dangers of like a
02:14:59 What's it called?
02:15:01 Parasocial relationships. I think he knows that I don't think sure I was saying
02:15:05 Yeah, like that's how he feels about it and because he feels about it. He's like
02:15:10 But I've heard and seen people say just end the show like what why should we end the show because you're feeling sad
02:15:20 It's not yours. We're the guys making it
02:15:23 Right because it's like different. I don't know. I mean I I liked like I
02:15:29 Certainly got a lot more entertainment out of a lot of the older episodes, but it's still nice
02:15:33 I still listen to it and enjoy it like
02:15:37 Wow, wow, thanks. Well, thanks a lot. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, shut the fuck up
02:15:46 the
02:15:47 It's you know, it's
02:15:50 It's felt it's it's hard for me to I felt like it's the end of an era so many times that I think like I've kind of just
02:15:59 internalized the lesson that like
02:16:02 Everything is change all the time the only constant is change. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's ever everything is the end of an era
02:16:10 No, no, no, it's weird. It's weird to even be thinking about like like mage hasn't been on in like six months
02:16:15 Davoo hasn't been on in like oh what like years like Jesse hasn't been on in like over a year
02:16:20 You know, he was at rad con and that was like it. This is like. Oh, this is like past
02:16:24 This is like over and done once you becoming a real boy. What does that even mean? I don't know this this tone of fine
02:16:28 Out this took people talk about it with a tone of finality. Yeah, like today's the last time anything will ever happen
02:16:36 But like nothing is ever final and and life has changed. I know I know it's a river the real
02:16:43 That they're having is that like it doesn't it's not gonna bounce back and suddenly be like it was
02:16:49 And they're coming to terms with the fact that it was past is the past this time
02:16:54 Cuz like I don't know the PC views always had like a rotating cast of
02:16:59 characters and some of them are just not coming back and they're just sort of coming to terms with that and I'm like, okay, I
02:17:05 Simplifies before I don't understand. I don't know if I sympathize anymore. I feel like we've had enough of this
02:17:11 I feel like this has gone on enough times. It's like, do you not get it yet? Do you not understand that nothing ever stays the same?
02:17:19 Yeah, I mean, I don't like agree that like
02:17:25 You know, I don't think that there's nothing to it
02:17:28 I just think it's it's kind of an old meme at this point to be like tired of the way the Pope the show is
02:17:34 Being sad about the end of an era like it's almost it's itself a meme that needs to die
02:17:43 Man, yeah, I'm sad. I miss when you all reviewed pony
02:17:48 Man go back to it. Please
02:17:51 Yeah, we always joke about having to go back and it's like I
02:17:56 Think the thing that's getting me is that people aren't like
02:18:01 You know, I don't know they seem actually distressed about this
02:18:05 It was like people memeing about like, oh, we have to go back. It's like half ironic
02:18:10 It's kind it's like our pony was really cool and and all that like it's an era that's gone
02:18:15 We'll never have it back and it's silly, but it was fun and
02:18:20 you know
02:18:22 Previous PCP times
02:18:24 Like it was a different flavor and it's like yeah, it's gone
02:18:28 It's not gonna be exactly the same as it was
02:18:30 But like people I don't seem to be able to like have a laugh about that. They don't they just seem sad and it's annoying. I
02:18:39 Don't want to shit on this guy in specific too much
02:18:42 I don't I'm not like bothered by him saying anything that he said, but but the the I shouldn't have said annoying
02:18:48 It's not what I mean. Yeah, yeah, sure. Um, but um, I know what you mean the general
02:18:54 Okay, like when we talk about like how we have to go back to the pony days when we're nostalgic for the pony days
02:18:59 It's because I
02:19:01 Mean it was it was um, I don't know like that was like an external circumstance that made things fun
02:19:08 It was like a fun time to be like breaking into the to the YouTube sphere or whatever and then but like
02:19:15 to say it now to say I
02:19:18 Don't know if like you prefer how if you prefer the older episodes and newer episodes fair enough but to like
02:19:26 To like want to go back like to ask to go back is
02:19:30 To like in this case when you're talking about the PCP like what you mean is like
02:19:35 Those people that that have like declined to be on the show anymore is like make them come back
02:19:41 And it's like well, what how would you even do that?
02:19:43 Like it kind of doesn't even make sense like your request is sort of nonsense when you really think about it
02:19:48 Am I making sense here? Yeah, I mean, I'm just I feel like why would you wish?
02:19:52 Why would you wish someone to do something that they have like made it expressly clear that they wish not to do?
02:19:58 It's not even just that it's that but like
02:20:02 Even if they do realize that, you know talking to us about it isn't going to get them force them to come back
02:20:10 It's it's the it's the either they come back or you end the podcast because I don't like it now
02:20:16 Oh, yeah, like I just don't get that like it feels almost
02:20:21 Oh, yeah, that's entitled to say entitled. Yeah
02:20:27 I don't know. No, I agree. I agree with that. It's very stupid very cringe. I don't know
02:20:35 And I don't I don't want to be too mean to this specific voicemail or anything
02:20:39 He's not like a big problem. He's not just a jumping I get for the I get worries coming from like I was I was a little sad
02:20:46 When you guys stopped doing pony stuff and then I'm like, oh wait, the other stuff you're doing is cool
02:20:50 And then I followed over and then I stopped doing pony stuff and it's like that was freeing like being away from it
02:20:56 Was actually the best decision I ever made and so yeah
02:21:02 Yeah, munchy going off being a real boy, you know quote-unquote like I don't even I don't even I'm sure yeah
02:21:08 I'm sure like it's really good for him bow and that's good if it is. I hope he's having a good time
02:21:13 I mean, he's he's doing what he wants to do. Yeah, as it as is everyone else whether they choose to come on the show or not
02:21:22 It's their own choice and do you not want them to like do as they wish
02:21:27 Like whatever it is. It is what it is and
02:21:31 Everyone is everyone is acting according to their own agency and
02:21:36 Why would you have it any other way? Why why wish why wish for something else? What's the point?
02:21:41 It's terrible stupid. It's like, okay, okay
02:21:46 I feel like we've gone on too long about this
02:21:48 But the last thing I say is the tone and like I actually really appreciated the comments in the last episode a lot of people really liked the cyber shell
02:21:55 Episode they thought he was a good guest. They thought the conversation was entertaining a lot of a lot of positive comments
02:21:59 That's fine, but on like some of the episodes that had that people have complained about
02:22:04 The the the feeling that they are complaining at the people on the podcast about
02:22:11 People choosing not to be on yeah, like it's like it's like like we're the ones like like it's our fault
02:22:17 For the ones that chose not to be here like how it doesn't even make it doesn't make any sense
02:22:22 But I guess there's no one else if they if they're not in the podcast
02:22:26 You can't leave a comment at them. These only we're the only ones you can you can criticize because we're the only ones here
02:22:32 I hate that so that I really hate that attitude
02:22:38 Fuck you commenters
02:22:40 Yeah, it's it's it's just like well, we talked about it enough next voicemail. Yeah, it's that's more than enough
02:22:49 This one is morality free electric jamboree
02:22:53 So the original voicemail about morality that I sent was in response to a discussion
02:22:58 You guys were having where you're trying to find ways to like define or to describe a moral system
02:23:03 I offered the terms of utilitarianism in like a goofy dumb way and then
02:23:08 Elaborated on what I actually meant by that in the next week
02:23:10 I was saying yet when taken to its logical conclusion
02:23:13 Utilitarianism just means to look at the utility of actions on a case-by-case basis and make moral decisions based on that
02:23:20 Tom last week said
02:23:23 Basically that he agrees that that is a good way to describe how people think morally and then said that my original voicemail
02:23:31 Was dumb because I was offering utilitarianism as a way to just like as that
02:23:37 System but like the second voicemail was just a definition for the first voicemail
02:23:43 So if you agree with the second you agree with the first
02:23:46 also
02:23:47 It was brought up like oh, I don't trust humans to be able to figure out the utility of each action and like
02:23:53 The human fallibility is not something specific to this way of thinking if that's a critique of every moral framework
02:24:00 You could come up with that's like I'm not saying that this is something that that transcends the limitations of our minds
02:24:06 This is just a responsible way to handle things
02:24:09 And it's the way that people generally do handle things so I was accurate and it's a good like thing
02:24:15 So everyone agrees. I am right all your disagreements are just different ways of saying you agree with me
02:24:23 All right, I don't know that's a good. That's a pretty good dunk pretty good dunk on us
02:24:28 I think I I haven't listened to this guy's voicemails, but I feel like
02:24:34 Utilitarianism in this way of just finding the utility is useful some of the time but not all of the time
02:24:42 Like I think what he's because like with the case like the Jaden animation
02:24:47 I think you're falling into the trap that he described no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
02:24:51 I'm saying that like for things like life and death
02:24:55 Utility utilitarianism in terms of like maximizing the number of lives saved
02:24:59 right? Is that how you would use that? But like on a smaller scale, on a smaller scale,
02:25:08 I don't know, you can't like, let's say somebody tells a joke and somebody doesn't like it.
02:25:14 Utilitarianism might end up with that person, like it's since it's only one person and more
02:25:23 people than that person enjoyed the joke, then the joke should be said or it should be allowed
02:25:28 or whatever. And it's a little more complex than that all the time. His first email was
02:25:35 utilitarianism means like whatever causes the most utility. And me and Tom were like,
02:25:42 yeah, but what is utility? How do you determine utility? His second one was like, yeah, what
02:25:48 I'm saying is, I'm not proposing that like we use this as a universal like universally agreed
02:25:54 upon yardstick to be applied across the board. The idea is that each situation should be
02:25:58 judged in a case by case basis, but with the understanding that like what we are looking
02:26:03 for is a resolution that maximizes utility. So he's saying, yeah, to me, that sounds
02:26:11 interesting. I just don't know how I don't know what is like on a large scale and a small scale,
02:26:17 what is utility? And like if we come up with two different examples, it's whatever you think
02:26:22 it is. It's whatever you think it is. I mean, I don't know. Let's say something like a trigger
02:26:30 warning or whatever. Somebody gets triggered by something, but most people don't. And it's
02:26:37 they're fine with it. Should, you know, the warning be in place? I actually, I guess it's
02:26:42 easy just to put a warning in place. I guess the thing would be like, if you don't like the
02:26:46 warning, just ignore it. If, if, well, it's not, it's not about that. It's like, should you put a
02:26:51 word in a thing? If one person will be upset and hundreds of thousands of people would not be
02:26:55 upset. Does utilitarianism have any like relevance there at all? Should you just not say it because
02:27:04 there's anybody like like utility is like you're choosing the better of two options. And I don't
02:27:11 know how you would like judge it in every situation. It feels like the word utility does not work in
02:27:16 all those different things. I really think you're falling into the exact trap that he described,
02:27:21 because I think I don't even know what he's saying. I don't know what utility means. Let me send
02:27:25 another voicemail, send another three voicemails. No, what he's saying, what he is saying is that,
02:27:30 yeah, you would just like that situation you describe, you would just have to look at it and
02:27:36 make some sort of like calculus of like, okay, well, how many people will be triggered by this
02:27:41 thing? How much distress will that cause them versus how much will, you know, including this
02:27:46 element in the work, you know, improve its themes or improve its quality in a way that like is
02:27:50 enjoyed by more people? Like, which, which does the negative outweigh the positive and just be
02:27:56 like, well, I don't know, what do you think? Do you think it does? Do you think it doesn't? And
02:27:59 like that's the, that's the decision making. I think it's not, yeah. It's very dependent on the
02:28:04 whims of the society that you're in too. Like if you have a society that really hates gay people,
02:28:11 then maybe it's more utility to just kill the gays because then you make more people happy if it's
02:28:16 only a few, right? I don't agree with that. I think, I think, I think the thing I'm having trouble
02:28:23 with is like, when it comes to like an individual, you know, you think of a situation, you're like,
02:28:30 okay, what is the, the most utility you can get out of this? It sort of is so wide ranging that
02:28:39 the term has no meaning whatsoever. It really just is do whatever you feel like it just means
02:28:44 whatever you think is good. Yeah. So therefore it is a completely useless term. I don't know why
02:28:48 it's even being used in such a like a, like a wide way. It's, I mean, I guess I agree in that if
02:28:56 you're going to be like, yeah, my system, my moral system is utility, utilitarianism, by which I mean
02:29:04 that I do things that I think will have outcomes that I feel are good. And like, yeah, I guess that
02:29:12 is too, you haven't really answered that question. That's why I mean, the thing I was talking about,
02:29:17 I think you've convinced me that it is a little overly broad. Yeah, like, like the thing I was
02:29:21 talking about, I think, before a couple of weeks ago was that it morality is, it's impossible to
02:29:28 have one rule that fits everything. And having multiple different specific rules for every
02:29:34 possible eventuality cannot have a word single, like a single concept applied to all of them. So
02:29:40 it's like, ah, fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. It's all just, it's all opinion anyway, at the end of the
02:29:49 day. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, based. Next one. Here we go. Oh, squad Zilla. Hey, Tom, I just wanted to know
02:29:59 that you have some competition on the Godzilla podcast front by none other than Maddox. He has
02:30:05 a Godzilla podcast called Godzilla versus podcast zero. Just thought that was pretty fucking funny.
02:30:13 Godzilla versus podcast zero. Is that like a theme podcast or just an episode of a Maddox podcast?
02:30:20 Sounds like an episode. No, it's um, Hailey Mancini and Maddox rules. No, it's a it's an entire podcast
02:30:29 about Godzilla starring Maddox and this other, this Hailey person. Kill it. What the fuck? Okay,
02:30:36 that's weird. That's funny. Did they know about this? Uh, it's been going since February of last
02:30:42 year. You should feud. You should, you should fight. You should call them out. They should
02:30:46 definitely start beef. They should definitely start beef with Maddox. I mean, in fact, they
02:30:52 should sue Maddox for stealing their ideas. I'm going to be honest. I don't know where this podcast
02:30:57 is located. Yeah, I, I see there's a Twitter account, but I, I certainly don't see a podcast.
02:31:05 I can't find like where it is in space. I'm not, I'm not, I'm getting a little lost looking for it,
02:31:10 to be honest. Squadzilla, though, I can find easily. That's, that's right there. That's imminent.
02:31:17 Yeah. Immediate, tangible. Uh, uh, fuck. Yeah. Okay. Funny, funny shit. Here we go. From Tony
02:31:27 again. Tony again. Yo, Tony again here. I actually have something to say this time. I appreciate
02:31:35 how at the end of the Tales Get Strolled video, when you're talking about gender pronouns and crap
02:31:42 like that, that you somehow managed to like circle around and independently discover the idea of
02:31:51 gender abolitionism and hell yeah, brothers. Fuck pronouns. Don't have them. Fuck gender roles.
02:32:02 Don't have them. Fuck gendered expectations. Don't have them. If I see a person walking down the
02:32:09 street, I shouldn't assume that they should look a certain way. That's weird. You say that I independently
02:32:19 arrived at it, but like, no, I've, I, I think I probably wouldn't describe myself as a gender
02:32:25 abolitionist for a while now. I think we've all had that even before Nate left. Nate, I remember
02:32:32 having a conversation about gender and he was like, yeah, like we shouldn't, it doesn't necessarily
02:32:37 need to have all of the, the, the stereotypes enforced. It's, it's all arbitrary. And we all agree
02:32:43 with that. It's just like, I think a little like real, like it's a, it's a, it's a fanciful idea
02:32:51 that is hard to implement. And it's, it's just sort of like easier to play along with, you know,
02:32:57 if you, if you decide that you like wearing makeup and wearing dresses and having long hair and,
02:33:05 and all that, then I guess it's easier to just call yourself a female because that's what people
02:33:10 expect. And it, it's easy. It just smooths things over. I don't agree with that. No, I mean, I, I,
02:33:18 I agree. I agree that you should be able if, and only if you want to call yourself a female
02:33:22 irrespective of whether you like makeup or whatever. Sure. Sure. I mean, I feel like I,
02:33:26 I would want to do that because it fits with everything else. Like I like, I like people
02:33:32 calling me. Yeah. I mean, I can understand if the way you are is more in line with what
02:33:39 is society expected of the female species. I understand that like, maybe it's,
02:33:45 that makes it more comfortable for you or whatever to do that. Yeah. It's, it's, it's because I
02:33:52 understand what you're saying. I grew up in a society and these expectations are like burned
02:33:57 into my brain that I can't easily just completely forget them. But I do agree that like, it would
02:34:04 be better to not have them in any way at all. Like you should teach kids that it doesn't matter.
02:34:12 And then maybe they won't have as much of like a, a feeling about it. And it wouldn't be an issue
02:34:18 in the future. It'd be the most based. Yes. It'd be the most possible, the most based we could,
02:34:24 we could get on a scale of cringe to base. Okay. Sick. Next one. Digimon Fox. Yeah.
02:34:36 Well, we're talking about Digimon on the last episode. And I am a Digimon fanatic. I've watched
02:34:43 literally every series, like twice, even the shit ones, even season six. And I just want to say
02:34:51 Tamer's easily the best one. But Tom brought up that, I think Hercules Kabu Teriman wasn't shown
02:34:57 and he is an idiot for that. Because Hercules Kabu Teriman and all the original season one cast,
02:35:02 mega evolutions were shown in Digimon Try the movie series. You fool. You absolute moron. Also,
02:35:12 Digimon Adventure 2020 Tom is back. It's airing again. And you should watch it because it's
02:35:19 really fucking good. It's just real good. It's fucking sick. And you should watch it. And Digimon
02:35:25 is sick. And then you were talking about Digimon. It's the best thing ever. Thank you. I'm glad
02:35:30 that this this guy got to flex his nerd knowledge about Digimon. I bet he doesn't get opportunities
02:35:37 to do that often to dunk on someone. I was a Digimon boy growing up, but I wasn't super into it.
02:35:45 Yeah, I was into the first series. And then I fell off it after they replaced the main cast.
02:35:52 I had the VHS of the first three episodes of Digimon. And I was annoyed because a VHS only
02:36:00 had three episodes. I was like, damn, how many VHSes am I going to have to buy? There's too much.
02:36:04 Fuck this. And I never tried to get any more. I saw Tamer's on TV and it was cool. My parents
02:36:11 bought a Digimon world for the PS1. And I think this was a discussion on the PCP recently
02:36:18 that your Digimon will take giant shits on the floor and you have to scold them for it.
02:36:24 No, you just clean them up, right? You can clean them up and then you have to yell at them
02:36:28 so that they don't do it again. And there's also a giant poop Digimon. Where else are they going
02:36:32 to shit? I don't know. I don't remember. I talked about Digital Dream, the guy with a couple
02:36:49 thousand subscribers. And I don't know if I specified, but I watched tutorials on him on how
02:36:58 basically to digivolve your Digimon in the latest release of the Cyber Pet or whatever
02:37:05 they're called, Digital Pets. And it's really funny that the screen is so small. The biggest your
02:37:15 Digimon can be is 10 pixels high, 12 pixels high or whatever. And so you got small ones
02:37:26 just a little blob. Then you got bigger ones and then you got ones that fill up the screen,
02:37:29 but even ones that fill up the screen or maybe just like a little six foot tall Agumon. But
02:37:33 then you got like Exo fucking Galaxy Super Novemon or whatever that is a fucking cosmic.
02:37:43 Yeah, that's like 50,000 feet tall and contains the entire universe within itself. And it's the
02:37:50 same like 12 pixels high. It looks identical. Yeah, I was like trying to strategize like which
02:37:57 one of these would I want to go for? Like which would be the most powerful base base?
02:38:03 They only have a Digimon thing. I know recently what I've seen is the Pokemon have good women.
02:38:12 They do. I think they're pretty good sometimes. And I saw this character and I thought cute.
02:38:17 I like them. That's a Digimon girl. I don't know her name. That's a Digimon girl. Yeah,
02:38:21 she's from like a new game. It's pretty cute. But it's pretty cute. Looks like a cop to me.
02:38:27 Yeah. No, no, she's like it looks like an airline. She looks like she works for an airline.
02:38:32 She looks like she works as a receptionist and she hates you for asking questions. Okay,
02:38:36 I found their name like Dotte Makiko or something. It's like it says like Cyber Sleuth. So I guess
02:38:44 she's like an investigator. I don't know what's going on. But a good character. Okay, I guess
02:38:47 she might be a little bit of a cop. Might be a little bit of a cop then. I like that she's mad
02:38:53 at you. That's good. Yeah, she's always pissed off, which is epic. I looked at Digital Dream again
02:39:01 yesterday and his newest video is a like Digimon fan song called like it's like a Halloween cover
02:39:08 of the Monster Mash, but it's like the with the lyrics changed to be about Digimon. Oh, dude. But
02:39:16 it's kind of good. Like it's like a hard rock cover with like electric guitars and drums and
02:39:21 shit. And like it's like it's like well produced and kind of good, you know, for what if you can
02:39:28 accept the absurd premise. He executed it with a plum. I just think it's very funny. Everyone
02:39:35 goes subscribe to Digital Dream. That guy's sick. Yeah, don't subscribe to Regular Dream. He sucks.
02:39:43 Yeah. No, fuck that guy. Like there's some guy called Regular Dream who's like got like
02:39:48 hundreds of thousands of followers. You're like, nah, nah, nah. Hey guys, I just had another dream.
02:39:52 Gonna take a make a vlog about it. I'm talking about fucking Minecraft YouTuber Dream, who's
02:39:58 actually kind of good videos, actually. But is there actually someone? Yeah, I didn't know.
02:40:03 He like does, he like speeds run. He's speed runs Minecraft, all his friends try to kill him,
02:40:08 and it's genuinely really exciting videos. And he's he's too good. He's too good at the game.
02:40:13 But everyone knows it's too popular. We can't talk about him. That's stupid. No, no, no, no. He'll
02:40:20 kill us. He will send his lawyers after us to kill us. We're basically by talking about him,
02:40:25 we're making the rich richer. We shouldn't do that. Damn it. And shut the hell is our edit out.
02:40:29 Sleep it. No, don't. No, I don't believe. Oh, I love I love I love this.

02:43:31 I mean, I was getting furry voice vibes, so you never know. Oh, dear. Here's another clue.
02:43:39 Another clue on the pile to be sleuthed by that, by Date Makiko. Yeah. Yeah, bringing it back.
02:43:46 I like, I like the, the obvious jokes were avoided. Good job.
02:43:53 I was waiting for Munchy Shatsky, but it never came.

02:45:06 Is, see, is to be like, Close Parentheses, Open Parentheses thing, like meant to look
02:45:11 like a butthole. Did I get that? I think so. Let me see. Let me, let me look up.
02:45:17 Sigur Ross. Oh wait. Sigur Ross. Or is it like that? Which way was it?
02:45:22 He, he think he said Open Parentheses, Close Parentheses. Yes. I guess it is a butthole.
02:45:26 Yeah, yeah. No, no, no. Yeah, the album is. Sigur Ross is, wait, is that a?
02:45:33 This is what it looks like. This is what the album cover looks like.
02:45:37 Oh, it is. It's, it's the, it's the, the band that Kezzy likes. It's another Kezzy.
02:45:43 It is, yes. Oh right. You could, you could put the Goatsey hands on that, pulling it open. That
02:45:46 could work. Oh, dude, it's gay primario. Let me tell you a story about Goatsey.
02:45:52 Yeah. I, well, it's not really. There's a, there's a, there's a bagel shop down my street.
02:45:59 Oh no. It's called, and their logo, their logo is a, no, no. Their logo is like a cartoon girl.
02:46:08 It's like, it's like a bust. You know, it's like from like the, the, the shoulders up.
02:46:11 Yeah. But she's holding a bagel and looking at it, but she's holding it with both hands
02:46:15 in a way that kind of looks like, you know, she's goat seeing it. She's grabbing that
02:46:20 Pona. Oh my God. Basically. What is the brand called? Could we Google it?
02:46:27 It's called, um, I'd rather not say it because it's like close to my, well, well, I'll, I'll put it
02:46:34 in the chat. Okay. I don't know if they, I don't know if like there's chains of it. I haven't heard
02:46:41 of it, but no, I think there's, it's just one. It's like in my, it's, I mean, I've said that,
02:46:47 like, I've said more or less where I lived before. If someone wanted a fucking piece,
02:46:51 it's called Goldilocks. I've already said that I live near Tufts University. So like,
02:46:55 yeah, there's a, there's a bagel place in my neighborhood called Goldilocks.
02:46:58 I didn't know you lived near there. Oh, I'll see you soon.
02:47:03 It's true. It's so fuck. Um, so, um, yeah, but, uh, do they have the, yeah. So you, so you see
02:47:12 the resemblance, right? I didn't realize her face would look so derpy. I was thinking of like a
02:47:18 Wendy's girl. Give, it kind of looks like your art style a little bit. It does. Not gonna lie.
02:47:25 A little bit. Yeah. A little bit. You got to draw her, Gib. You got to put her in a comic. Oh, no.
02:47:33 Um, but the story is I was walking by on the way to the post office to send off some more copies
02:47:39 of Vapors 2 available now on my Twitter feed. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. And, uh, and they, um,
02:47:47 and on my way back on the way there, I was, I was, I walked by them and they were playing music
02:47:52 inside and I heard a couple of notes that I recognized. I was like, wait a minute, wait,
02:47:56 what is that? What is it? What is that song? What is this? Is that like a Disney musical? Is that
02:48:00 like from a movie or something? Like, why do I recognize that? That's so familiar. And I went
02:48:03 back and I listened and I realized, no, they're playing, they were playing bad religion. They
02:48:07 were playing like old, an old bad religion song from like one of their like earlier albums. And
02:48:11 I was like, oh, fuck yeah. These guys are old school punks. So I went and I delivered my shit
02:48:18 and on the way back, I was like, you know what? I don't even want bagels. I wouldn't eat them
02:48:22 because they're not keto, but I'm going to just buy like a dozen bagels from these people and just
02:48:26 give them my housemates because like, fuck it, have them, have some, because I want to give them
02:48:31 my business because they like a band that I like. And uh, but I, but I went up to the door and I
02:48:37 rang and like they didn't answer. I think they're doing some weird thing with like because of COVID.
02:48:41 I think they're like, they're open for like, you have to like call ahead of time and order
02:48:45 or something. I don't know if they do just like, yeah. So I didn't, I was not able to complete
02:48:51 the transaction. Darn. But, but I tried. Ripperoni. I'll maybe, maybe in the future I will, Lamal.
02:48:59 Uh, yeah. Cool. So, uh, that's that voicemail. Where's the next voicemail? How many more do we have?
02:49:09 Yeah. How many? Uh, like eight. Oh my God. Okay. We're most of the way through. Okay. Uh, part one,
02:49:16 let's look, we need a direct democracy and the problem is like representative democracies, right?
02:49:27 They, they don't like the reason why they exist is because of two reasons. One, because direct
02:49:32 democracy used to be impractical before the digital age, for the internet age. And number two, because
02:49:41 if you have like a politician, they're expected to know about political things. You know what I mean?
02:49:46 And like, you can't expect the average person to know everything. Well, you can, but they won't.
02:49:53 And the problem with direct democracy is that the average person is retarded, like really dumb.
02:49:58 Like the average person doesn't care about anything and they're stupid. It really just
02:50:04 open your eyes and you'll see it. Uh, but the thing is like, you think the solution, right? You only
02:50:10 let smart people vote, right? And then you'd be like, well, how do you define a smart person?
02:50:16 Smart person, right? Is it because there are people who are very intelligent, who would be
02:50:22 extremely unknowledgeable and would make poor decisions. So I guess you'd have to test their
02:50:27 knowledge, but you'd also have to like make sure they're not like really dumb and would just come
02:50:33 to the wrong conclusion. And, you know, maybe the solution to that is to simply only take votes from
02:50:39 a intelligent group of people or only take votes from the most intelligent group of people. For
02:50:44 example, white males. Yeah, we got there. We got there. Woo. Uh, uh, was that ironic? Was that
02:50:54 like, was the point there that like, wait, was the point that we actually do need a direct
02:50:58 democracy or was that the joke that we, that it would be stupid? Uh, I think I mean, I feel like
02:51:06 there was a, like an implication that you could technically do a direct democracy on your phones.
02:51:11 Vote now with your phones. Uh, if, if there was like, like live stream Senate man is like, all
02:51:17 right, we're going to vote on, um, this thing and then vote now with your phones. Do you like it?
02:51:24 Do you hate it? And then everyone who gives a shit will use the app, whether they're stupid or not.
02:51:31 And then we'll know. I think that could work. Well, we can find out who's stupid by how they
02:51:38 vote. Is there, is it so then kill them? That was called part one. Is there a part two? Uh,
02:51:45 no. Okay. Thank God. Maybe. Yeah, I agree. Um, that's, that's plenty. Oh, wait, I want to say,
02:51:54 I saw a great tweet. I saw a great tweet today from my boy on Twitter. Posadas trap God. Um,
02:52:02 uh, and, uh, wait, what's his name? Well, he goes by, he goes by Aaron Dolphin emoji now,
02:52:09 whatever. Posadas trap God with no O on the trap God. He said, uh, he said, uh, uh,
02:52:16 said democratic socialism is, well, he said it was an oxymoron, but he meant redundant. He said
02:52:21 democratic socialism is redundant because socialism is inherently democratic. And you know what? He's
02:52:27 fucking right. That's your education. That's everyone's fucking anarchist education, uh,
02:52:31 for this episode. That's me going on my political run. I don't like everybody on subs. Everybody
02:52:35 unsubscribe. Um, I am, I am being messaged, uh, frantically that we, we got to go to the store
02:52:41 because it's going to close. Uh, okay. We ran too long. I'm sorry. It's our, it's on us. It's on
02:52:48 us. We've got like a couple more. It's right. Uh, what happens with foes? Are you going to try
02:52:52 and do them yourself or next week or no, there's no way we could, we could bear the burden of doing
02:52:57 we have to die. We must, we must soldier on. We must listen to the last seven voicemails. I'm
02:53:02 sorry. We have no choice. There's no alternative. There's no way. If only there was some way
02:53:07 we could cease to do it, but we cannot. Okay. I'm sorry. Oblivion. It was great having you on.
02:53:14 Yes. Thank you for coming on. Thanks for being a guest, buddy. Thanks for having me, uh, be gay.
02:53:20 It's good. Uh, um, everybody, I mean, everybody subscribed to oblivion fall. It's on YouTube.
02:53:27 Yeah. Or the after dark. That's the big one now. Like my secondary channel, like, yeah, I put
02:53:33 comzone on there when it had a hundred subscribers. Now it has 60,000 and it surpassed my main. So
02:53:39 I'll go to maybe rebrand. I don't know what's going to happen, but, uh, cool. Oh yeah. Go check out.
02:53:45 If you haven't seen, uh, comzone. Wait, is it comzone? Yeah, welcome. Welcome to the comzone.
02:53:51 Yeah. Go check out that. Yeah, the other is a link. Check out, check out the other, um, yeah,
02:53:56 check out all the oblivion fall links in the, down in the thing, down in the thing. Yes.
02:54:00 Thank you. Thank you for being on. Yeah, you're, you're welcome. And this is fyi. The last time I
02:54:07 was on a podcast also had to leave early because of going to the store. That was a podcast with
02:54:13 the store. That was a podcast with A and Y and keyframe. If you remember those names.
02:54:18 I remember A and Y and keyframe. Wait, when was the hell long ago? That was probably like 20 years
02:54:22 ago. Well, that podcast was like two years ago. I mean, even two years ago was past the, was past
02:54:27 the heyday. Oh yeah. I was out of, I was out of the community, but he escaped with me. He also
02:54:33 works at a DA games. So yeah. Oh, you are. Yeah. I, I have, I have, I see, I see keyframe.
02:54:43 I'll see a tweet of hers like every once in a while. She's like, I don't know. I'm like
02:54:47 peripherally aware of keyframe and everyone I'm like, huh, so she got like a real job,
02:54:51 huh? That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy shit. She, she even, uh, the backgrounds for the
02:54:57 cuphead animation, the real big one. Uh, those are real, uh, physical watercolor paintings that
02:55:04 key did. So. Oh wow. Yeah. Fancy. Well, I guess that's, that's a very, I guess, I guess that's the
02:55:12 podcast. I guess that's the podcast. Bye. Bye. See ya. Okay. Next one is called society. Three,
02:55:22 two, one, go. I think we should all, we should all mature as a species. We should stop pretending
02:55:29 that memes need to be confined to the internet. We need to use memes in real life. Yeah. Based,
02:55:34 based, cringe, cuck, say, cuck, cringe, cuck, based, cringe, cuck, based, cringe, cuck. Everybody,
02:55:44 everybody get hype for based cringe cuck. I can't fucking. I can't do it. You will,
02:55:50 you will now. I say based in real life. That's okay. I say based in real life. I,
02:55:57 I would say, well, not in every company, but I would say co-cro-wish in real life. I would call
02:56:02 something my co-cro-wish. You're my co-cro-bitch. No. I cannot wait for the next time I get the
02:56:11 opportunity to embarrass myself and then, and then flawlessly recover by saying, I'm just being cool.
02:56:18 That's going to be a hell of a time. I've never, I, I never think to, I, I think it's just like
02:56:24 when I say something embarrassing, I don't really realize that it was embarrassing. And then by
02:56:30 the time I could have said something, someone else's like, I don't know, the awkward silence is set in.
02:56:37 And so I stumble. I won't get. Like I don't really get the good opportunity to say,
02:56:40 hey, I'm just being cool, like, like in a retaliatory sort of way.
02:56:45 I get embarrassed when I'm talking sometimes, but like, I don't know if it's always about things
02:56:51 that are genuinely embarrassing. And I think that maybe I don't notice when I say things that are
02:56:55 genuinely embarrassing. So I think there would probably be times when I would say I'm just being
02:57:00 cool, but it would be in a context where like, I didn't, I thought that I needed to say it,
02:57:05 but it didn't really need to be said. And like, it would have been better somewhere else.
02:57:10 It's true. You got to have a real, you really got to have a high self-awareness stat to know
02:57:15 exactly when to employ it. You've got to like, hold it in your back pocket as like a safety
02:57:21 measure when you are like, pretty sure that the people in your company are not going to like
02:57:25 the thing you're about to say. Yeah, yeah, emergencies only. Yeah. Like, do these people,
02:57:32 do these people like this kind of humor? I don't know. I'll just say I'll be, I'm being cool in
02:57:37 case. I'll just say, I just, I got a really, oh man, kind of really funny racist thing I want to
02:57:42 say, but like, are these people racist? Well, if they're not, I just say I'm being cool afterwards.
02:57:47 That's what it's for. That's secretly what it's for. Ah, shit. You know what? Don't use it anymore.
02:57:54 Don't use the, don't use it. It's not a trick. You're not allowed to. It's a PCP dog whistle.
02:57:59 It is a PCP dog whistle. It is though. Okay, next one. Anon moose PCP loyalist. Three, two, one, go.
02:58:09 Ben, the saint, you claim nothing is happening behind the scenes, but that's exactly what someone
02:58:15 who was hiding something would say. Your move cowboy. What do you think?
02:58:21 Uh, he's right. Everything is happening behind the scenes. In fact, there is no the front of the
02:58:29 scenes. It's like a big Rube Goldberg machine back here, back here in the land of inside baseball.
02:58:39 Rube gold boy. Moving, moving parts, moving pieces, big, the likes of which you've never seen
02:58:48 cosmic powers outstripping everything. If you think about it, the entire universe
02:58:54 is behind a scene that we are not privy to. There's like it like outside the universe. There's like a
02:59:00 curtain and behind the curtain is us. So everything's behind the scenes. Nothing will ever be on the
02:59:08 scene. Oh my God. And that means, and that therefore, if you say that nothing's happening
02:59:16 behind the scenes, then you mean everything is happening in the universe. Yes. Yes. Okay, next
02:59:27 voicemail. Oh, we got anon moose PCP loyalist PS post script, I guess. Three, two, one, go.
02:59:35 Also about three, the nipple like now women are cringe dude, hippo and digi have been better women
02:59:40 than like most women while you're there with you know, I don't know what you mean.
02:59:44 They're better women than most. Is that what he says? Is he saying, is that because you,
02:59:48 you two don't show the nipple? Is the implication that most women do show the nipple and it's bad?
02:59:57 I'll take the compliment. I don't even know what he meant really, but yes. No,
03:00:01 I don't understand this guy. I don't understand. I don't understand what this guy is talking about.
03:00:05 If he says that I'm gooder than someone else, that's good. I like feeling superior. I'll take it.
03:00:11 I'll take any compliment under any circumstances. Next one is going to be based. Ben is parentheses
03:00:19 not a sexist. Wait, three, two, one, go. A man is allowed to beat his wife so long as it is no
03:00:27 thicker than his thumb. That is the origins of the saying rule of thumb. You could instead just say rule.
03:00:37 Okay, I don't know why the music kicked in.
03:00:45 You mean if the rod, if the rod was no thicker than his thumb, that's what is
03:00:50 you're trying to say. Yeah, he's good. Only cowards beat their wife with a rod. Use your bare fists.
03:00:56 Yeah, if you keep you on your edge, you've got to be able to keep the marriage strong if you can beat
03:01:03 your wife and a bare knuckle fist fight in a fair fight. That's what it takes. If you're using a rod,
03:01:11 you've given up. You better end up with blood on your knuckles after the beating or you're not a real man.
03:01:19 Next one, next movie, that voicemail sucked. It wasn't even about me.
03:01:27 I think it may have been in response to you saying rule of thumb sometime.
03:01:32 Oh, did I?
03:01:34 Yeah, fuck it. It doesn't matter. No, it's terrible, terrible, terrible. Voice jail?
03:01:40 Voice jail? No. For you, Ben St, for saying that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
03:01:45 Okay, moving on moving on. No, no, we will we will not convene a vote on that question
