00:00:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.
00:00:05 I'm supposed to be working right now.
00:00:11 I'm supposed to be working right now.
00:00:16 But I'm not working.
00:00:19 I'm doing nothing.
00:00:22 My dick, I'm drinking.
00:00:24 Myself, I'm sucking.
00:00:27 I am an asshole.
00:00:30 I am a stupid.
00:00:32 I got a deadline.
00:00:35 Don't wanna do it.
00:00:42 We've been expecting your unwashed presence today.
00:00:45 Proud and noble vagrants and rabble-rousers.
00:00:48 It seems as though you've made a mistake.
00:00:50 A wrong turn, perhaps?
00:00:52 Fate remembers not such tribal details
00:00:55 as the catalyst for its inauguration.
00:00:58 For the fact rings as loud as ears would allow
00:01:02 sans rupture, and you have found yourself
00:01:04 in the Procrastinator's podcast.
00:01:07 And here alongside me are internet content creators
00:01:11 of most twisted and tortured tribe of artistic triumph
00:01:15 inconceivable to your noble and prissy class.
00:01:20 Yes, these cultural barbarians stand before you,
00:01:22 and their ceaseless advance will leave you
00:01:25 shocked, bruised, battered, and railed against
00:01:29 as we talk about that most lascivious of subjects.
00:01:32 Sexual intercourse!
00:01:35 Today I have with me Digibroider.
00:01:40 Yeah, get it in.
00:01:45 We have...
00:01:49 I will assume that was the best guy ever.
00:01:54 Let's talk about sex, baby.
00:01:58 Let's talk about you and me.
00:02:01 You guys remember the 90s?
00:02:04 Now it's the best guy ever.
00:02:07 An extremely goofy movie was My Sexual Awakening.
00:02:12 We have to hear...
00:02:17 Invisible in Cell and mythical MGTOW hypocrite
00:02:21 here reporting for duty.
00:02:25 Now it's all children of the world
00:02:36 and Santa Claus has ever wondered,
00:02:39 what is sex?
00:02:41 Well, I've gone to the highest power there is.
00:02:44 I've committed suicide and I've gone to heaven
00:02:46 just to get this one fact for you.
00:02:48 The top definition for sex on UrbanDationary.com is
00:02:51 sex is like math.
00:02:53 You add the bed, subtract the clothes,
00:02:55 divide the legs, and pray you don't multiply.
00:02:58 I love it.
00:03:01 Alright, let me kick back a cold one.
00:03:04 As I unwind here, as you see,
00:03:06 this is a pretty broad topic that could potentially
00:03:09 span the entirety of human reproduction
00:03:12 and as a human that's a pretty big deal.
00:03:14 But, as what I prepared for today
00:03:17 is the main crux here of what I want to spread
00:03:21 with you warped virtual vermin here.
00:03:24 The question that people have jeered and sneered
00:03:27 at my house for and made fun of me
00:03:30 for my completely legitimate beliefs.
00:03:33 Let's cut the chase here as all new listeners
00:03:37 will pitifully think as ironic or pretentious,
00:03:40 but longtime fans will know are all too real
00:03:43 and pretentious.
00:03:44 Is sex good or is sex bad?
00:03:47 Well, I have a question before I answer.
00:03:51 I've heard that when you have sex
00:03:54 you have to show the girl your penis.
00:03:57 And if that's true, I have to say it must be pretty bad.
00:04:01 Because that just sounds like a sex peepee.
00:04:05 That's not okay.
00:04:07 I thought sex was when the keyblades touch,
00:04:09 but I'm not sure about the dual keyblade.
00:04:12 Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
00:04:14 Ben, so if it's when you show a girl your dick,
00:04:17 does that mean if there's two boys, then it's fine?
00:04:20 Well, yeah, guys can't see penises because they look away.
00:04:24 Like, guys reflexively look away from another penis.
00:04:28 Guys can't have sex.
00:04:30 I mean, maybe.
00:04:32 I have like a sixth sense dick detector
00:04:36 that if there's like dick nearby, I can avoid it.
00:04:39 Like, if I walk into a bathroom, I'm immediately aware
00:04:42 of like how in danger I am of seeing anyone's dick.
00:04:44 It's like when you come into a room
00:04:46 and you can hear that the TV is on, even if there's no volume.
00:04:49 Yeah, is that a question?
00:04:51 You can hear the presence of a visible dick.
00:04:54 Okay, so you have a special dick sense that most guys don't have.
00:04:57 So you have more relation to dick.
00:04:59 It allows me to avoid it.
00:05:01 I don't know that that's uncommon.
00:05:03 I feel like lots of guys are constantly in don't see dick mode.
00:05:06 It sounds like most men who go into the men's restroom
00:05:09 know that there are men in there who have penises.
00:05:12 I've spent a lot of time in changing rooms
00:05:14 and I've spent a lot of time looking at men's dicks.
00:05:17 And I just want to ask, is it gayer or not gayer
00:05:20 to have a specific dick aversion?
00:05:23 Because I just don't care.
00:05:25 I've looked at a lot of dicks, I look at a lot more as my tastes go on.
00:05:28 When I go to the men's room, I specifically try and find trick shots
00:05:31 and fucking sniper viewpoints where I can see that guy's fucking dick
00:05:34 without him realizing that I'm sneaking at him.
00:05:36 God damn it, look here exactly what I'm afraid of.
00:05:39 I'm afraid of this and the fucking bathroom.
00:05:41 Digi, it's not my fault your dicks looking like a fucking snack right about now.
00:05:45 It's not my fault.
00:05:47 You gotta cover that shit up.
00:05:49 Yo, wrap that shit like a quiche for me, baby.
00:05:52 I want to see that thing covered in smegma.
00:05:54 That's what I'm all about.
00:05:56 I want you to stick a fucking toothpick for that hors d'oeuvre
00:05:59 right through your fucking re-thrift.
00:06:02 I want to see a waiter walk out with a plate full of those snacks.
00:06:06 Just spread them around to the whole high-class crew that we've gathered to sample.
00:06:10 I will admit my flaccid cock looks exactly like one of those fucking little barbecue sausages.
00:06:16 Every time I eat one, I'm like, this is just a dick.
00:06:19 Smothered in barbecue sauce, just smothered.
00:06:22 The ones that you eat out of a can with a fucking toothpick.
00:06:25 You know what I'm talking about?
00:06:27 Yeah, they know what that is.
00:06:30 Fucking order in the court.
00:06:32 Let's make the rounds here.
00:06:34 Let's get the general statements first.
00:06:36 What are your general thoughts on sex, Nate?
00:06:39 Is it all good or is it all bad, Nate?
00:06:42 It's all good or all bad.
00:06:44 He asked me, Ben, shut up.
00:06:46 Okay, my thoughts on sex are it is only acceptable in the missionary position
00:06:51 for the sole purpose of reproduction.
00:06:53 These are my thoughts.
00:06:55 I'm glad I picked you first.
00:06:57 Did you?
00:06:59 Did you?
00:07:01 Is sex all good or is it all bad?
00:07:03 It's all good for me, baby.
00:07:05 Oh!
00:07:07 Look like a fucking snack from where I'm sitting.
00:07:11 Hippo, is sex all good or is it all bad?
00:07:16 Well, it depends on how far we define sex.
00:07:21 No, no, is it all good or is it all bad?
00:07:23 No, because I'm thinking you can make a baby without having sex.
00:07:28 True.
00:07:30 That's like what that guy tried to do in The Silence of the Lambs
00:07:33 when he just threw his jizz at that lady as she was walking by his cell.
00:07:36 That's like how you do it.
00:07:37 I think the way I see it is that making babies is pretty cool
00:07:40 because babies are cute, but then sex is like a hassle
00:07:43 and you don't want to have to do it.
00:07:45 It's indirect. It's not the most optimal prime position to have a baby.
00:07:50 The prime position is just, you know, lobbing jizz at random women.
00:07:53 The worst part about sex is the burned calories that interfere with my gains.
00:07:58 That is the biggest problem with sex, for sure.
00:08:00 It's just a lot of red tape you got to go through.
00:08:02 That's true. That's true.
00:08:04 Nate, in order to retain that protein, you should do a Nate of your own every time.
00:08:08 Yeah, you got to do a Nate right in your own mouth.
00:08:10 No, that's a fucking snack I'd like to eat if you were to fucking say it.
00:08:14 Glug, glug, glug.
00:08:16 Ben, is sex good or is it all bad?
00:08:19 Well, my interest is piqued. I'm very curious about the subject.
00:08:25 I'm very interested in learning more one day.
00:08:28 Perhaps one of the five gentlemen could show me a thing or two.
00:08:32 Yeah, but I'm prepared. I'm prepared for it to be bad,
00:08:35 but I still kind of want to find out if you know what I'm saying.
00:08:38 I'm risking the danger someday, but not yet because I'm a little baby boy.
00:08:43 I don't trust myself as a bad sexual or only attracted things that make me feel bad
00:08:48 to things that are consistent, like, consistency, considered bad things, like murder.
00:08:55 I'm only attracted things such as that.
00:08:58 Okay, okay, okay, okay.
00:09:00 Necrophilia? All right, all right.
00:09:02 Okay, to ask myself that thing, I have, legendarily, the controversial belief that sex is all bad.
00:09:12 And I have written, here, I posted in the chat,
00:09:17 something like, like, 1600 words ran out in my fucking notes.
00:09:23 Like, I have a fucking lawyer, I have like a prosecution lawyer for fucking sex
00:09:29 trial case right before me right now.
00:09:32 Okay, muchi, I got to ask.
00:09:35 To me, I feel as though, when I hear you say sex is all bad,
00:09:41 I just think you are objectively wrong because some people are having good sex right now in the world.
00:09:49 So, what is bad about their sex?
00:09:52 Like, is sex bad for like a higher reason than that it, you know,
00:09:57 like, you're not saying that all sex is bad to, like, it's not a bad time,
00:10:02 but you're saying it's like morally bad, right?
00:10:04 Maybe muchi's one of these guys who's saying that, like, you know, like,
00:10:07 sex can reproduce children and it's immoral to bring children into the world
00:10:11 because they will suffer to some degree.
00:10:13 I think the idea is that sex is not productive.
00:10:17 Like, it's not productive in a real way.
00:10:20 Like, it might make babies, but that's bad.
00:10:21 Well, that's what I want to know.
00:10:22 I mean, it's, it's like as literally productive as you can possibly do.
00:10:25 Not, not at all.
00:10:26 It could do anything.
00:10:27 Yeah, I think you're on a purpose that it's intentional for.
00:10:29 I want to know, yeah, which is bad?
00:10:31 Is it the recreational aspect that's bad?
00:10:33 Is it the productive aspect that's bad?
00:10:35 What's, yeah, tell us, tell us.
00:10:36 The problems with sex in two words are society and time.
00:10:42 In one word, pressure.
00:10:44 In a whole fucking bunch of words.
00:10:46 Again, one hundred, sixteen hundred words written down here.
00:10:50 I'm ready to fucking like Roman Senator go as hard as fucking Ken Ham
00:10:56 as a fucking mother bleeper here.
00:10:58 Okay, well.
00:10:59 Feel what's her screenplay at a moment's notice.
00:11:01 So, so.
00:11:02 Well, let's get into it.
00:11:03 Argument one, argument one.
00:11:04 What's, what's wrong?
00:11:05 Number one, society.
00:11:08 Sex is one of, if not directly, society's main measure of wealth and status.
00:11:15 It is the root.
00:11:16 The starting point.
00:11:17 What about wealth and status?
00:11:18 Yeah, what about those two?
00:11:20 Yeah, well, those are all.
00:11:22 I'm a bunch of here.
00:11:23 It is all in pursuit of sex, basically.
00:11:25 No one, well.
00:11:26 Okay, everyone in the world understands that Bill Gates is the richest man
00:11:31 and the most successful man in the world.
00:11:33 Jeff Bezos is Jeff Bezos now.
00:11:36 There is, okay, whatever.
00:11:37 There's never been a time that Bill Gates has had to be on TV with a hot chick
00:11:41 to prove to people that he's the richest and most successful man in the world.
00:11:44 Like, he's never, his wife is just some normal looking lady.
00:11:48 Like, he's never had to be like, oh, fucking, I'm banging a supermodel.
00:11:51 This is the ultimate show of wealth.
00:11:53 We all know he's the most wealthy because he has the most money.
00:11:56 So, money is by far the biggest show of like fucking status in the world.
00:12:01 Well, on a biological level.
00:12:03 And what do you attract when you have money and wealth?
00:12:06 You attract sex.
00:12:07 But you don't have to taste it.
00:12:09 Bill Gates doesn't have to fuck a bunch of random girls just because of that rich.
00:12:12 I mean, I think people, like, I think people admire if they think that, like, you could have sex.
00:12:18 Like, you don't have to actually do it.
00:12:19 Exactly.
00:12:20 But like, if they detect that, like, you couldn't even if you wanted to, then that's bad.
00:12:24 I don't think people look up to rich people because they think they get laid all the time
00:12:28 because you don't have to be rich to get laid all the time.
00:12:30 What you have to be rich to do is to fucking own the world.
00:12:34 Well, you're oversimplifying.
00:12:36 What does it mean to even owe the world?
00:12:38 Like, if you, okay, the whole point of this is what is the measure of a successful human being?
00:12:43 And from our origin, biologically speaking, what a successful human being was,
00:12:47 I mean, for guys, let's just say, a successful man was someone who impregnated lots of people
00:12:52 and passed along his genetic code.
00:12:54 That was success for that person.
00:12:56 I think that's not, like, that is not what we as a society,
00:13:00 like, we don't think, oh, the most successful guy is fucking Ron Jeremy
00:13:05 because he's fucked the most girls.
00:13:07 Well, he, subconsciously we do.
00:13:08 Subconsciously, if people with disabilities are represented, maybe you do.
00:13:14 Would you not say that sex is one of society's main measures of wealth and stash?
00:13:19 Because that's what my sentence was.
00:13:22 I thought you said it was the most.
00:13:24 That's what I heard.
00:13:26 Sex is one of, if not.
00:13:29 Oh, well, it's not. It is not. It is just one of.
00:13:33 One of, okay, sure.
00:13:35 Like, let's continue. That was the first sentence I said.
00:13:38 I would argue that the concepts of sex and death, like, are the root drivers of everything that human beings do.
00:13:45 Like, money is garbage, money is to have sex.
00:13:48 No, I agree that it's the drive of everything we do.
00:13:50 It's just not how we measure success.
00:13:52 Like, it's not the number one way that our society measures success.
00:13:55 Well, it's like the root thing. It's like saying that, like, yeah.
00:13:58 We're already in the weeds here.
00:14:00 We're already getting caught up on minutiae and pedantic fucking semantics here.
00:14:04 It's not pedantic. We're already there.
00:14:06 This is the meat. This is the real shit.
00:14:08 Okay, whatever. It's an important issue related to all this.
00:14:11 But, okay, bunch of go on. Go on. What else you got?
00:14:13 Again, again, I'm making it.
00:14:15 It's the starting point of major and vast social contracts.
00:14:20 It's the root of a whole...
00:14:22 Most of the shit we do is for sex.
00:14:24 To be bad at sex, or to be considered unattractive,
00:14:27 is synonymous with being undesirable, unwanted,
00:14:31 and you are literally losing life by not reproducing.
00:14:35 It is the subject of many key debate,
00:14:37 and it is, like, when it was sought after,
00:14:40 concept in all of life as we know it,
00:14:44 in all of, like, multi-cellular life,
00:14:47 is to fucking have sex. That's it.
00:14:49 That's the lens I'm dealing everything from.
00:14:51 That's the starting point from what it is.
00:14:53 I'd like to expand on the thing I said earlier
00:14:57 about making babies without sex.
00:15:00 This is sort of tying into that,
00:15:02 in that the need for society, in society,
00:15:07 to have had and be having sex all the time,
00:15:10 at least enough, is, like, a big pressure.
00:15:15 And if baby-making was entirely, like, scientific,
00:15:19 you just go to a place, you get a baby,
00:15:21 like, that would make that less of a problem.
00:15:25 I think...
00:15:26 I think babies should come out of the scientist place,
00:15:30 and sex should be not real.
00:15:33 Then you could do eugenics without having to be uncomfortable
00:15:37 to say that you like eugenics.
00:15:38 Well, here's what I think.
00:15:40 I think that, like, not the having of sex,
00:15:44 but the ability to have sex is, like, if you wanted it,
00:15:48 is, like, an indicator of power,
00:15:50 and, like, the ability to, like,
00:15:52 you know, the ability to, like, do what you want
00:15:54 and, like, not be impeded.
00:15:55 That is definitely true.
00:15:56 And so, like, yeah, like, I don't know,
00:15:58 if you see a guy and you're, like,
00:16:00 oh, man, I bet that guy could get laid,
00:16:01 that's, like, you know, like, that's one thing
00:16:03 that's, like, oh, well, he's got that,
00:16:04 like, he's powerful in that way.
00:16:06 It's, like, oh, this guy's got a lot of money.
00:16:08 Oh, he could afford a lot of stuff.
00:16:09 He's powerful in that other way.
00:16:11 I mean, there's no need to, like, look at,
00:16:13 look at it past the just, like, you know,
00:16:15 the frat level, just, like, like, don't you agree
00:16:18 that, like, when you see someone who fucks a lot,
00:16:20 that's, like, oh, wow, cool.
00:16:22 Do you not have that thought in your mind?
00:16:24 Do you not think, like, wow?
00:16:26 Yeah, we all do, I think.
00:16:27 That's what I'm saying here.
00:16:28 I'll set a level.
00:16:29 It has social currency.
00:16:31 Sex is social currency.
00:16:32 That's true.
00:16:33 Correct.
00:16:34 And as such, I think that it is undeserving
00:16:38 of this, what would I call it,
00:16:41 this stature, this status in the world.
00:16:45 I do not think it is deserving of this
00:16:46 for multiple reasons.
00:16:47 Number one is that, well, like, the main,
00:16:51 I guess, appeal of sex outside of making babies,
00:16:54 which is not really a main thing, like,
00:16:58 culturally, that's not the main thing
00:17:00 people have sex for.
00:17:01 Do you guys agree?
00:17:03 Yeah.
00:17:04 Yeah.
00:17:05 Mostly.
00:17:06 Wait, I'm sorry.
00:17:07 You're saying that it's not, say that again.
00:17:09 I'm trying to parse what you just said.
00:17:11 People have sex because it feels good, right?
00:17:13 Yes, correct.
00:17:15 Well, I think a lot of people have sex
00:17:17 for those social reasons, because, like,
00:17:19 having sex makes them cooler guys.
00:17:21 I think, I do.
00:17:23 I do.
00:17:24 I do.
00:17:25 I think that people have sex because they feel
00:17:28 an incredible tugging urge to do it at all times.
00:17:31 Yeah, that's exactly that.
00:17:33 I don't think people have, I don't think people
00:17:35 have sex as a consequence of knowing that it feels good.
00:17:38 Like, we know it is supposed to feel good,
00:17:40 but, like, you want to, like, you know,
00:17:42 until you have sex, if you're, you know,
00:17:45 like some of us who didn't have sex,
00:17:47 that we were well into our 20s and wanted it
00:17:49 since we were fucking 10, then, like,
00:17:52 you've spent a lot of time just obsessing over it,
00:17:55 not even knowing that it feels good
00:17:57 or how good it does feel or, like,
00:17:59 what it's going to be like.
00:18:00 It's just, like, this insatiable fucking urge
00:18:03 to have it drives you towards it, you know?
00:18:06 It's ingrained deep into your brain,
00:18:09 and I would argue we should surgically remove that.
00:18:13 Literally every human generation.
00:18:15 Okay, here's why you guys are all wrong,
00:18:16 especially you, Munchie, and it also gives.
00:18:19 Every generation of human being that has existed
00:18:21 up till now has obviously passed on the trait
00:18:24 of wanting to have sex because sex is good,
00:18:27 because that is how the human race has evolved.
00:18:30 And it is the desire to have sex that,
00:18:32 and, you know, and the fact that the human race
00:18:34 is divided into two sexes, male and female,
00:18:37 to promote genetic diversity that has allowed
00:18:39 the mutations that allows, you know,
00:18:41 like mammals to evolve into apes, into human beings.
00:18:44 Like, it all exists for the very specific purpose
00:18:47 of genetic mutation,
00:18:49 so that, or genetic diversity,
00:18:51 set the best of the best rise to the top.
00:18:53 And the problem right now is that we are no longer
00:18:55 living in a Darwinian system,
00:18:57 and now everything is just done, like, pure,
00:18:59 because humans are, like, so software driven,
00:19:01 as opposed to hardware driven out,
00:19:03 like society dictates how we do things like,
00:19:05 now you just fuck hot guys as opposed to,
00:19:07 you know, like the best fathers, just as, like, one example.
00:19:10 It's completely changed the way this whole thing works,
00:19:13 but we've still got these archaic things beat into us.
00:19:16 I personally think that we're better off
00:19:18 in a more Darwinian system than we are now.
00:19:20 I don't disagree with that.
00:19:22 I wasn't arguing against that at all.
00:19:24 Well, you were saying that it's wrong.
00:19:26 I actually think we might be getting,
00:19:28 hold on, I actually think we might be getting
00:19:30 better about, like, finding
00:19:32 better matches for people,
00:19:34 and this is why, like, online dating
00:19:36 is taken off so much.
00:19:38 Sponsored by eHarmony.com.
00:19:40 None of those have ever worked for me.
00:19:42 My method was get famous enough for people
00:19:44 to fucking message you, you know,
00:19:46 either way, it's still online dating,
00:19:48 and like,
00:19:50 I think that
00:19:52 the reason it's so popular is that
00:19:54 people are dissatisfied with, like,
00:19:56 finding, like, just whatever's
00:19:58 in their local, like,
00:20:00 I feel like we've expanded
00:20:02 the gene pool
00:20:04 in a way, where it's like some of us who are born
00:20:06 on this new generation are not
00:20:08 meant to fuck within our town, because we've
00:20:10 developed a system of beliefs
00:20:12 that only really exists
00:20:14 in the internet space, you know,
00:20:16 like, the kind of people that we are,
00:20:18 especially guys like us who spend
00:20:20 a lot of time online, like,
00:20:22 we need to have, like, a mate who understands
00:20:24 the internet, because, like, the kids
00:20:26 that we're gonna have are gonna be, like,
00:20:28 super fucking plugged into that,
00:20:30 and as technology, you know, improves,
00:20:32 I'm plugged in. Oh, yeah.
00:20:34 I'm just saying, like, for all we know
00:20:36 by the time we, like, all our kids are, like,
00:20:38 10, they might be rolling out, like,
00:20:40 oh, money microchips in your hands
00:20:42 and shit, and, like, we need to be able to, like,
00:20:44 I need a mate who's up and up on
00:20:46 technology so that when we have to teach
00:20:48 our kids about computers, you're not a fucking
00:20:50 retard about computers, because that's going to ruin our
00:20:52 kids' future. Every kid needs to grow up
00:20:54 learning coding, you know?
00:20:56 My kid's gonna know coding by the time they're 10.
00:20:58 You know?
00:21:00 Dude, do you plan on blocking websites
00:21:02 from your kid?
00:21:04 Um, I mean,
00:21:06 if he's, like, 5, I should put it on, like,
00:21:08 an adult mode, you know?
00:21:10 Like, most electronic devices have
00:21:12 some kind of, like, here, hit
00:21:14 this button and only kid-friendly stuff appears,
00:21:16 you know? So I'd probably do
00:21:18 that until I thought they were, like,
00:21:20 I mean, if they get old enough to figure out
00:21:22 the internet, there's nothing I can do to stop them.
00:21:24 Like, nothing stopped me
00:21:26 or any of you, you know, like, once
00:21:28 we got into the open wide internet,
00:21:30 we just found everything we wanted to find.
00:21:32 So, um,
00:21:34 you know, there's no stopping them, but you have to get to a certain
00:21:36 age before you even have, like, the cognitive capacity
00:21:38 to do that, you know?
00:21:40 I feel like...
00:21:42 This is, again, a topic,
00:21:44 but I feel like there might be
00:21:46 some duty as
00:21:48 parents to not let your
00:21:50 kid be a role-player.
00:21:52 Very personal
00:21:54 issue for you, I know.
00:21:56 We can't let another one fall to that.
00:21:58 Yeah, I feel like
00:22:00 there are some websites that I'm
00:22:02 torn on, on PossiblyBane,
00:22:04 but we can do an entire
00:22:06 topic on the child.
00:22:08 A good idea. Let's do a banned websites episode.
00:22:10 Yeah, yeah, yeah!
00:22:12 Websites we won't let our kids use.
00:22:14 YouTube.com
00:22:16 Yeah, yeah.
00:22:18 We'll wait until we are actually dads.
00:22:20 Then we can do some shit like that.
00:22:22 It'll be fun to do one before being a dad,
00:22:24 then after being a dad.
00:22:26 Oh, okay, okay.
00:22:28 You just said about how, like,
00:22:30 like, it's not like
00:22:32 you're choosing to get
00:22:34 horny. You never just, like,
00:22:36 think, okay, like, it's time for me
00:22:38 to get horny. Bone are happening now.
00:22:40 Well, sometimes, I mean,
00:22:42 if I'm bored, then that's literally
00:22:44 what I do. Well, most people I don't
00:22:46 think, that's their experience with
00:22:48 sexuality. It's your
00:22:50 decision to go look at things that will
00:22:52 make you horny. You can't turn it on
00:22:54 without any stimulus.
00:22:56 I mean, I can think about things that'll make me horny, but...
00:22:58 Well, that's you searching
00:23:00 for it still. Yeah.
00:23:02 The memory archive of the mind.
00:23:04 Yeah.
00:23:06 That vast mental fortress, they called
00:23:08 the Digi Cranium. Yes, yes.
00:23:10 Um, uh, fucking, yeah,
00:23:12 yeah. This is
00:23:14 a biological cancer
00:23:16 that is forced upon every
00:23:18 human. And just to
00:23:20 clarify, the, is sex all
00:23:22 good, is all sex bad?
00:23:24 Like, obviously, that is a mean point.
00:23:26 My more nuanced actual
00:23:28 thesis is that sex is
00:23:30 placed too highly status wise
00:23:32 in culture.
00:23:34 In culture, you're saying. In culture.
00:23:36 You know, I don't think the problem
00:23:38 is culture. I think the problem is that
00:23:40 it's got too, it just has too much
00:23:42 of a hold over our minds. Like, it's
00:23:44 just that our minds are, like,
00:23:46 are geared in such a way that, like, all
00:23:48 week, it's
00:23:50 weird, actually, because humans, their
00:23:52 reproduction cycle is super fucking slow.
00:23:54 It takes nine whole months to have a baby,
00:23:56 and after you've
00:23:58 had it, you can't, you would have another one
00:24:00 for, like, a couple more months. So, like,
00:24:02 the better part of, like, you could basically
00:24:04 have one kid a year. And so, it doesn't
00:24:06 really make sense that the dick gets hard,
00:24:08 like, eight times a day. Like,
00:24:10 you're not really meant to be out impregnating
00:24:12 fucking everyone, because you'll narrow the
00:24:14 gene pool if, like, one guy is having babies
00:24:16 with every fucking chick. So, it doesn't
00:24:18 make sense that we want to have sex
00:24:20 as often as we do. And then there's
00:24:22 some people who are like. Well, what did it
00:24:24 make a drive for, like, you know, early man
00:24:26 to want to have sex all the time, so it creates
00:24:28 a better... Yeah, let's talk about what
00:24:30 makes sense. I keep getting confused
00:24:32 if we're talking about early man, or if we're talking about, like, now
00:24:34 for society. No, it made
00:24:36 sense at a time, but it doesn't make
00:24:38 sense now, because, like,
00:24:40 we don't, like, you know,
00:24:42 women are not scarce the way
00:24:44 they were back then, probably.
00:24:46 You know, like, you didn't have to,
00:24:48 like, you didn't need a constant drive
00:24:50 to be seeking one out, or trying to,
00:24:52 like, capture and, like, you know,
00:24:54 fucking
00:24:56 inseminate one. Like, nowadays
00:24:58 it's like, most people just settle
00:25:00 down with one woman, and they've got,
00:25:02 like, she can have as many babies
00:25:04 with you as you want her to have, you know,
00:25:06 or as they, as you agree to have together.
00:25:08 As you agree to have.
00:25:10 I mean, you can probably convince her to have as many
00:25:12 as you want. Well, maybe.
00:25:14 It's real easy to convince a woman to have another baby.
00:25:16 If you, like, act like, if you can, like,
00:25:18 give her, like, a sob story as to why.
00:25:20 How many of you are so... I'm convinced to have a baby
00:25:22 with you.
00:25:24 None yet, but I know how easy it is.
00:25:26 How do you know that?
00:25:28 How do you know that?
00:25:30 Why do you say that? Have you ever...
00:25:32 I don't get it.
00:25:34 All you gotta do is be, like,
00:25:36 Oh, but, like,
00:25:38 Please!
00:25:40 Let's say you've got eight, and she's, like, nine is too many.
00:25:42 I guess after, like, four at that point
00:25:44 you're just like, why not have more?
00:25:46 And they'd probably be like, yeah, I can't even keep track of them at this point anyway.
00:25:48 But, like, a woman has to go through, like, nine months
00:25:50 like, that's like, a horrifying ordeal for them.
00:25:52 I mean, at some point you just get used to
00:25:54 being pregnant most of the time.
00:25:56 What?!
00:25:58 You don't even know what a pregnant person is!
00:26:00 Think about that lady, the 18
00:26:02 and counting lady. Like, that bitch was pregnant
00:26:04 most of her life. That's one bitch!
00:26:06 That's one fucking piece of shit.
00:26:08 She seemed to be having a great time, though.
00:26:10 You know what I'm saying? I actually have no problem with her
00:26:12 whatsoever. I'm just memeing.
00:26:14 I'm also memeing, and I don't remember what the hell
00:26:16 I was actually talking about.
00:26:18 What a wonderful use of everyone's time this has been.
00:26:20 Why is sex bad?
00:26:22 Tell me more.
00:26:24 I keep trying, but did she come in
00:26:26 with non sequiturs that completely derail
00:26:28 discussion midway through
00:26:30 one sentence after one
00:26:32 sentence?
00:26:34 I was making a point and I just told a joke
00:26:36 and then everybody, like, latched onto the joke
00:26:38 and I expanded on it.
00:26:40 So, I lost track of what I was
00:26:42 actually saying.
00:26:44 I'm saying that sex will hijack your mind
00:26:46 in situations where you will not want this.
00:26:48 You could be in a funeral, you could be in a baby shower,
00:26:50 you could beat your own funeral
00:26:52 and you would still get a vote.
00:26:54 I think I've got a fundamental problem
00:26:56 with your arguments here.
00:26:58 I think your point is perfectly valid,
00:27:00 but here's where I just hit a stopping point.
00:27:02 Like, this is just how...
00:27:04 Starfleet.
00:27:06 Actually, this is kind of the opposite of Starfleet.
00:27:08 It's just like, this is just how humans are.
00:27:10 So, what good does it do
00:27:12 to talk about how mad we are
00:27:14 just how humans are?
00:27:16 We can get rid of it with robot splicing.
00:27:18 We can splice it right out.
00:27:20 We can splice that shit.
00:27:22 We can download a patch update
00:27:24 and get the DLC for our human consciousness.
00:27:26 I think actually it would help a lot
00:27:28 if we... I think part of the problem right now
00:27:30 is everyone's really overstimulated
00:27:32 in modern society that there is
00:27:34 such easy access to
00:27:36 pornography and you can watch...
00:27:38 I definitely think that I grew up
00:27:40 with way too much
00:27:42 access to, like, sex.
00:27:44 Because, like, I'm fucking...
00:27:46 I feel like I'm horny all the fucking time.
00:27:48 Like, just non-stop. And it's always been this way.
00:27:50 It's not just now, like,
00:27:52 I've always just been, like, wanting
00:27:54 to fucking jack my dick all day.
00:27:56 Everybody knew this!
00:27:58 Like, you listen to the pub crawl.
00:28:00 I used to talk about how much I jack off all the time.
00:28:02 I've listened to one episode
00:28:04 of the pub crawl made.
00:28:06 I thought you... I thought you listened to...
00:28:08 You told me you listened to, like, everything I'd ever done.
00:28:10 Yeah, I specifically said besides the pub crawl,
00:28:12 I specifically said that I don't like pub crawl.
00:28:14 I specifically said that I don't like pub crawl.
00:28:16 Well, pub crawl is great, anyways.
00:28:18 I used to...
00:28:20 I, you know, I just feel like
00:28:22 I've always been over-sexed. It's mostly because
00:28:24 of overexposure, too.
00:28:26 Like, I'm fucking constantly surrounded
00:28:28 by, like, posters of sexy anime girls
00:28:30 and fucking I'm always on A
00:28:32 and they're always posting porn on A
00:28:34 and they're always... I'm just saying that, like,
00:28:36 the internet is just constantly inundating
00:28:38 you with, like, images of sex
00:28:40 and, like, society, if I watch
00:28:42 TV for long enough, I'm going to see, like, an ad
00:28:44 with some fucking hot chicken
00:28:46 and I'm going to be like, well, I've got a boner now.
00:28:48 Like, you know...
00:28:49 DJ, absolutely. I absolutely
00:28:51 see where you're coming from with this.
00:28:53 But where I immediately hit a brick wall for myself
00:28:55 is, what can possibly be done?
00:28:57 What could anyone do?
00:28:59 Why is it me? Shit.
00:29:01 Here is what I think I'm not communicating well.
00:29:04 The point is not to just stew
00:29:06 on the fact that, like, wow,
00:29:08 we are like this, isn't it bad?
00:29:10 And we need to abolish sex.
00:29:12 That's what I'm trying to say. I'm saying
00:29:14 that we place too much emphasis on sex
00:29:16 and I think it will do some good
00:29:18 to look at the negatives of sex
00:29:20 to kind of knock it down a notch in our minds
00:29:22 so we can better conquer it.
00:29:24 So, maybe you're talking about how, like,
00:29:26 right now, like, at college, it's, like, a big
00:29:28 meme that everyone goes to college and just, like, fucks, like, crazy.
00:29:30 Like, that's, like, a cultural phenomenon.
00:29:32 So you're saying that, like, it might be better
00:29:34 if we just, we don't emphasize that so much.
00:29:36 Maybe our, maybe our, like, our movies
00:29:38 stop, stop lionizing, like, these guys
00:29:40 who just fuck, like, crazy, like, in these
00:29:42 college movies, like, like, things of that sort.
00:29:44 Exactly. Exactly.
00:29:45 Okay, okay, I got it.
00:29:46 That it just stops become,
00:29:48 it stops being such a federal fucking issue
00:29:50 for all things related to sex.
00:29:52 If I can just plant a flag.
00:29:54 If I can just plant a flag, you know.
00:29:56 If I can plant a flag on it, in my sense,
00:29:58 I think nobody will be surprised by this.
00:30:00 But I personally, I have a lot of sex.
00:30:02 I do. I had a large amount of sex
00:30:04 yesterday and today, and it was great.
00:30:06 But I really am not
00:30:08 that interested.
00:30:09 You beat me to, like, doing that bit.
00:30:11 Like, I, I thought I was going to be the one, like, obnoxiously
00:30:14 bragging about having too much sex.
00:30:16 Well, I, I bring it up because it's relevant to my point,
00:30:18 goddammit, not because I'm just trying to brag.
00:30:20 That's why I thought it would come up.
00:30:22 And everyone's just like, oh, but if I had done it
00:30:24 that way, even if it was for my point,
00:30:26 everyone would have been like, oh, do you,
00:30:28 you are the boy, you are the boy
00:30:30 who cried, I had sex.
00:30:32 I am not that boy.
00:30:34 I am, I am a good boy.
00:30:36 Yeah, you, you're just not.
00:30:38 You fucking sat there, you sat there like the intro
00:30:40 of that Slipknot song that's like,
00:30:42 I felt the air rise up in me.
00:30:44 You're like, you're like sitting there, like,
00:30:46 peering from the bushes, waiting for a chance to get to you.
00:30:48 It's more like that, it's more like the intro to a song
00:30:50 that's like, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, do you feel that?
00:30:52 Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, oh shit.
00:30:54 It's the next reaction point.
00:30:56 I care about this intellectually.
00:30:58 I care about this topic.
00:31:00 I want you to say what you were going to say.
00:31:02 Okay, what I was going to say was that
00:31:04 even though I have access to sex right now,
00:31:06 it's great, I do it a lot,
00:31:08 it does not provide any practical
00:31:10 benefit to the things I'm trying to
00:31:12 accomplish in my life other than kind of
00:31:14 just satiating my base level human needs.
00:31:16 And for that reason,
00:31:18 I totally understand, like I personally,
00:31:20 I went through a big dry spell for years
00:31:22 recently and that sucked.
00:31:24 But now, now that I have it, I no longer
00:31:26 give a shit.
00:31:28 I don't spend any time like, stewing on it.
00:31:30 It is just, I have a checkbox.
00:31:32 I had what was previously an unchecked box
00:31:34 that is now a checkbox for sex.
00:31:36 It's done. It is handled in my life.
00:31:38 And I can now move on
00:31:40 to all the other stuff that I want
00:31:42 to spend my time on and make progress on
00:31:44 every day. That's how I feel.
00:31:46 And I feel like culture should treat it that way.
00:31:48 It's just something you gotta deal with.
00:31:50 It's basic. It's like, it's like, yeah,
00:31:52 when people, you know, they say
00:31:54 that like sex is only a big deal if you're
00:31:56 not having any. Because if you're not having any,
00:31:58 you're gonna start to feel like, you know,
00:32:00 something's wrong and you're missing something
00:32:02 and oh god, oh god.
00:32:04 And then you get it. And it's like, well,
00:32:06 it wasn't that big a deal and there are more important
00:32:08 things, you know, it's just, it's just something
00:32:10 you gotta deal with. I don't know if I feel that way.
00:32:12 I always felt like, if I could,
00:32:14 if there was like a hypothetical
00:32:16 situation where I could have a partner
00:32:18 for life without worrying about
00:32:20 the sex aspect,
00:32:22 I probably would.
00:32:24 You mean just like you could not fuck?
00:32:26 If it wasn't real, okay. No, if it wasn't a
00:32:28 real thing and I could just like, I could
00:32:30 marry a person that I like to hang around
00:32:32 with. Because, you know,
00:32:34 nice people don't always have the big
00:32:36 sex parts. And if you don't
00:32:38 get a person that you like who also
00:32:40 has the big sex parts, then
00:32:42 I'm like a bitch with a big old
00:32:44 vagina. I'm talking people
00:32:46 who are down to their knees, my dude.
00:32:48 I want a girl with a curl. This is a volleyball.
00:32:50 That's what that's about.
00:32:52 I want to beat that thing around like a boxing bag.
00:32:54 I'm gonna throw it. I'm going to throw it.
00:32:56 I'm going to throw it.
00:32:58 Alright.
00:33:00 You know those boxing montages?
00:33:02 You know those boxing montages?
00:33:04 Like doing this thing,
00:33:06 like doing this spiral motion. That's me,
00:33:08 boy. That's me every time.
00:33:10 I want to chomp down on my girl like a
00:33:12 French dip. I'm gonna dip that Chinaz
00:33:14 and I'm going to take a huge old
00:33:16 biker. Real quote. Real quote from a friend
00:33:18 of my girlfriend. When I go down on
00:33:20 a girl, I want something to bite on to.
00:33:22 Referring to pubic hair.
00:33:24 Referring to pubic hair.
00:33:26 Okay, this is real.
00:33:28 Settle down, children.
00:33:30 What I was saying is the...
00:33:32 What is it?
00:33:34 Get the fuck out.
00:33:36 Get the fuck out.
00:33:38 Get the fuck out.
00:33:40 I don't know what I'm saying.
00:33:42 I don't know what I'm saying.
00:33:44 I don't know what I'm saying.
00:33:46 Oh, yeah.
00:33:48 Wait, wait, wait.
00:33:50 You were going on about beef curtains, I believe.
00:33:52 You were going on about beef curtains, I believe.
00:33:54 Yes.
00:33:56 Sex is like...
00:33:58 People either have the body they...
00:34:00 Usually, they just get a good sex body
00:34:02 that is sexually attractive.
00:34:04 It's either you die or you lose.
00:34:06 And if you marry that person,
00:34:08 you'll be like a baby boomer.
00:34:10 You'll be every old person ever.
00:34:12 You'll be unhappy and you won't like them.
00:34:14 Oh.
00:34:16 You're describing me, hippo.
00:34:18 A person with a great sex body
00:34:20 and a terrible personality that you don't like.
00:34:22 Exactly.
00:34:24 I would kind of...
00:34:26 If sex bodies weren't part of it,
00:34:28 or either...
00:34:30 If you could augment your body really easily,
00:34:32 but it's expensive.
00:34:34 If sex wasn't as big a deal,
00:34:36 you could just worry about getting
00:34:38 to it with a person that you like
00:34:40 and want to spend time with,
00:34:42 and then marriage makes a lot more sense.
00:34:44 And it's not even a big deal.
00:34:46 I would like to hug and cuddle people.
00:34:48 I just don't care about all the squishy shit.
00:34:50 Well, you can do that now, you know.
00:34:52 You can just not...
00:34:54 I know I can do that now.
00:34:56 It's just...
00:34:58 That's what the whole discussion is about.
00:35:00 It's societal pressure.
00:35:02 I would slightly object to the idea
00:35:04 that you are, and you have to be that way forever.
00:35:06 Because, you know, I'm a big self-improvement guy.
00:35:08 Unless you're born with a cataclysmically tiny dick,
00:35:12 or, you know...
00:35:14 Cataclysmically.
00:35:16 That's the right word for it.
00:35:18 Unless you have some actual physical defect.
00:35:20 If you're just a sensuality guy.
00:35:22 Under the weight of the tininess.
00:35:24 Of the absence of weight of this dick.
00:35:26 What I mean by that is that I just wish
00:35:28 I didn't feel certain ways about people
00:35:30 who were attractive or not.
00:35:32 Their personalities.
00:35:34 It's not possible because, you know,
00:35:36 a person is made up of everything about them.
00:35:38 Did you know?
00:35:40 My whole point is this...
00:35:42 My one point about this is just that
00:35:44 I understand all the frustration with sex.
00:35:46 It totally makes sense.
00:35:48 But life, I think it's appropriate
00:35:50 that has intense, extremely brutal
00:35:52 backbreaking struggles that we have to
00:35:54 overcome if we want to get where we're at.
00:35:56 That means life will be full of suffering.
00:35:58 But when you achieve it,
00:36:00 there's a better person for it.
00:36:02 That's how I think about life a lot.
00:36:04 It's the whole, don't wish for lighter burdens.
00:36:06 Wish for broader shoulders.
00:36:08 I think between hippo and munchy
00:36:10 we've touched on what I think
00:36:12 is a solution for how sex can be handled in culture.
00:36:14 Which is simply
00:36:16 to educate people better
00:36:18 on what
00:36:20 sex feels good.
00:36:22 Because I think there's...
00:36:24 You're talking about dating ed classes.
00:36:26 Pres proposed by Christian Western-Chandle.
00:36:28 That sounds dated.
00:36:30 That's his joke.
00:36:32 Not mine.
00:36:34 What about dating
00:36:36 ed with two D's, double D?
00:36:38 My favorite ed in any character.
00:36:40 I thought it was a girl who I had to crush on
00:36:42 because I thought it was a girl.
00:36:44 Ladies, get off your butts and date him.
00:36:46 Anyway,
00:36:48 I think there needs to be more education
00:36:50 because basically all we tell kids
00:36:52 is like, here's how to have safe sex.
00:36:54 Here's the problems with sex.
00:36:56 You don't have to have sex when you're young.
00:36:58 But you're going to...
00:37:00 So instead what we should tell them is like,
00:37:02 hey, guess what?
00:37:04 If you go to some random party
00:37:06 and get drunk and fuck some random guy
00:37:08 you're probably gonna regret it in the morning.
00:37:10 However, if you find someone
00:37:12 who you really genuinely care about
00:37:14 and is gonna take care of you
00:37:16 it might actually feel good.
00:37:18 Maybe you should go find sex that's good.
00:37:20 Forgive me for going full anarcho-capitalist here.
00:37:22 It is totally...
00:37:24 It's the problem. It's that
00:37:26 society, at least in America,
00:37:28 parents have abdicated
00:37:30 the responsibility of raising their kids
00:37:32 to schools and the state
00:37:34 in a huge degree.
00:37:36 In my life, not to shit on my dad,
00:37:38 but I really felt like there was a lot of things
00:37:40 about how to be a man that I just never knew
00:37:42 until I looked into pickup culture
00:37:44 in my late teens and 20s
00:37:46 and then I learned how to be a man.
00:37:48 The only reason I know anything about sex
00:37:50 is that I watched so much fucking porn
00:37:52 and I literally would ask women online
00:37:54 about their sex lives.
00:37:56 Hey, baby, did you order a sausage pizza?
00:37:58 It works every time.
00:38:00 I mean, if you watch fucking...
00:38:02 Try to watch the porn that doesn't feel fake
00:38:04 and then you'll feel like, oh, okay,
00:38:06 that's what actual sex looks like.
00:38:08 Gang bang, rape, abduction, dungeon.
00:38:10 I literally remember the first time
00:38:12 I ever saw an amateur porn
00:38:14 and was like, oh, real sex looks like that?
00:38:16 Oh. That's totally different
00:38:18 from what I thought it looked like.
00:38:20 No, that is good to know.
00:38:22 Not about brassers shit.
00:38:24 I would just find people online that I could talk to
00:38:26 and ask them questions about
00:38:28 what was it like the first time you had sex?
00:38:30 What is it like this time?
00:38:32 Just learn about it from asking people
00:38:34 because no one taught me the right information
00:38:36 that I wanted to know.
00:38:38 Everyone needs an American Pie-style
00:38:40 Kamina older brother guy
00:38:42 who they can ask what sex feels like
00:38:44 and how to do it.
00:38:46 Everyone needs a guy like that.
00:38:48 I'm definitely someone who passed that
00:38:50 kind of information on to
00:38:52 my...
00:38:54 I'm going to tell my brother,
00:38:56 turns out sex is great, you should go
00:38:58 trying to have sex with that girl
00:39:00 who you might want to have sex with.
00:39:02 I probably did tell him that
00:39:04 after the first time I had sex.
00:39:06 I was probably like, you got to try this for yourself.
00:39:08 Shade beat us both
00:39:10 through the punch.
00:39:12 That someone in the family
00:39:14 was fucking
00:39:16 I thought it was cool.
00:39:18 If Grace was a guy,
00:39:20 well, I don't know.
00:39:22 Our sister became
00:39:24 an independent person
00:39:26 before Ben or I either of us did.
00:39:28 She just
00:39:30 felt like she wanted to be out on her own
00:39:32 and then became an independent adult.
00:39:34 I don't know.
00:39:36 My little brother is the same.
00:39:38 Maybe it's
00:39:40 like he has
00:39:42 experience because I'm the older brother
00:39:44 and he just had a head start
00:39:46 in his life about
00:39:48 what I knew when I knew it.
00:39:50 Our sister always had more of
00:39:52 an adverse reaction to
00:39:54 like she didn't like
00:39:56 being in our parents...
00:39:58 She always resisted more
00:40:00 of our parents' control
00:40:02 and Ben and I weren't happy about it
00:40:04 but she had that desire, that urge
00:40:06 to be free on her own.
00:40:08 I hated living with our parents.
00:40:10 But we didn't have the spark to do anything about it.
00:40:12 Whereas Grace,
00:40:14 apparently she was so into
00:40:16 getting out of there as fast as she could
00:40:18 and then she did. But she's way tighter
00:40:20 with the parents at least
00:40:22 than I am.
00:40:24 She hangs out with them
00:40:26 which I don't get at all.
00:40:28 That's how you leave the house.
00:40:30 That's how you ease your way
00:40:32 out so your parents don't question it
00:40:34 because they'll just be like
00:40:36 if they see enough of you anyway
00:40:38 I think that's how I got away with
00:40:40 being fucking May away
00:40:42 because I just kind of showed up out of nowhere
00:40:44 and after like three weeks
00:40:46 moved into a place with her.
00:40:48 But like her parents are right there
00:40:50 like her work was next to like her dad's house
00:40:52 so it was like she'd go there all the time
00:40:54 for lunch and so it didn't feel like she's gone
00:40:56 like she's kidnapped by some internet guy
00:40:58 you know?
00:41:00 That'll ease the transition.
00:41:02 It's a good way to make them not
00:41:04 afraid.
00:41:06 Okay okay okay cease fire
00:41:08 give me like five minutes don't interrupt me
00:41:10 because here's the main thing I want to
00:41:12 get on.
00:41:14 I can talk all day about how
00:41:16 we should
00:41:18 sex is not like
00:41:20 that pressure but it's like a minimal
00:41:22 like fleeting high that you get
00:41:24 whatever the fuck. Here's the main thing.
00:41:26 Here's number two
00:41:28 time. Here's my main
00:41:30 problem with sex.
00:41:32 Sex takes up so much fucking
00:41:34 time.
00:41:36 That's my biggest problem with sex too.
00:41:38 Did you just hear
00:41:40 my words? Did you just hear
00:41:42 me say that I wanted
00:41:44 you to be quiet for maybe just
00:41:46 five minutes while you read
00:41:48 my script that I've been writing
00:41:50 all night that I could do for
00:41:52 this worst podcast?
00:41:54 Do you not think you can be quiet for five
00:41:56 minutes? Here we go.
00:41:58 Sex takes up it's not radical
00:42:00 to say that takes like maybe
00:42:02 like a fifth of your life.
00:42:04 It's not hard to talk about the sheer
00:42:06 genocidal amount of time
00:42:08 you're wasting thinking about sex.
00:42:10 Can I ask a question?
00:42:12 Are you talking about sex or like
00:42:14 pursuit of sex?
00:42:16 He'll explain.
00:42:18 You'll see.
00:42:20 Just wait.
00:42:22 I will understand.
00:42:24 No! No!
00:42:26 This is not over!
00:42:28 No!
00:42:30 I
00:42:32 I
00:42:34 on average have masturbated
00:42:36 two times a day for the past six months
00:42:38 or around 30 minutes each.
00:42:40 That's an hour every day. Assuming there's
00:42:42 three days in a month that is 30 hours
00:42:44 each month. That's 120
00:42:46 hours in six months. I have
00:42:48 wasted a work week of
00:42:50 my life in the past six months
00:42:52 obtaining the basic uninspired
00:42:54 bland boiler plate
00:42:56 cheap flaccid unremarkable thrills
00:42:58 that I've had a million times before.
00:43:00 That's not even talking about the real thing
00:43:02 which is way longer than 30 minutes.
00:43:04 And that's not even talking about
00:43:06 the immeasurably holocaustic
00:43:08 years we spend
00:43:10 attracting people to have sex with.
00:43:12 The hours we spend playing on make-up
00:43:14 by an uncomfortable clothes practicing our pickup skills.
00:43:16 Nate, Nate, how much time do you
00:43:18 spend in Japan practicing your womancraft?
00:43:20 Confidence increasing our life skills and this is
00:43:22 not true.
00:43:24 I call woman mancy.
00:43:26 Yeah, yeah, yeah, woman mancy.
00:43:28 This is not like the whole shit thing.
00:43:30 I'm just saying.
00:43:32 You have spent thousands of hours of your life
00:43:34 dedicated to pursuing sex.
00:43:36 Is that inaccurate to say?
00:43:38 Well, that is
00:43:40 fairly accurate and the only thing I would say
00:43:42 is that I think that these skills are related
00:43:44 to lots of other valuable things that I discovered
00:43:46 in pursuit. But okay, but that is true.
00:43:48 Yeah, I just said
00:43:50 I don't think I spent like any time in my life
00:43:52 at all pursuing sex.
00:43:54 What about
00:43:56 masturbating? That counts, doesn't it?
00:43:58 Yeah, that counts.
00:44:00 You know what I spent thousands of hours
00:44:02 doing? Playing team
00:44:04 Fortress 2. I play
00:44:06 that game and get the most powerful
00:44:08 direct dopamine stimuli
00:44:10 in the moment and I can constantly
00:44:12 reflect fondly on this genius level design
00:44:14 and art style. Not only
00:44:16 that, but the fondest memory I have
00:44:18 are playing that game with my friends forging
00:44:20 unbreakable alliances.
00:44:22 That's a problem of sex, is that you
00:44:24 spend your time wasting away
00:44:26 literally end metaphorically
00:44:28 twiddling your clit, waiting to have
00:44:30 sex, or hours you could be playing
00:44:32 learning the skill doing your work. You are not trying to tell me that team Fortress 2
00:44:34 is better than sex.
00:44:36 I literally am, I literally am.
00:44:38 I literally am saying that. There's no
00:44:40 video game I enjoy as much as I like having sex.
00:44:42 I will put that down.
00:44:44 There's no, I can't think of
00:44:46 anything I'd rather be doing.
00:44:48 Believe me, I'm not saying this
00:44:50 slightly. I have had the conversation
00:44:52 in my head while having sex
00:44:54 is this actually better than Dark Souls?
00:44:56 And the answer is yes.
00:44:58 And I've read three different
00:45:00 tests. The skill
00:45:02 lore is so low for sex. It's incredible.
00:45:04 The skill ceiling is incredibly high.
00:45:06 That is a real thing.
00:45:08 Okay, the problem
00:45:10 with sex is the same problem with Mario Odyssey.
00:45:12 All the rewards are the same
00:45:14 level. You get a moon for everything.
00:45:16 You never get any higher rewards
00:45:18 than just a moon. It gets boring
00:45:20 after a while.
00:45:22 That's literally true.
00:45:24 Make it out like sex is just
00:45:26 go until you come and then you're done.
00:45:28 You can do other things.
00:45:30 It doesn't have to be about achieving the same
00:45:32 you don't have to just be trying to
00:45:34 get that same reward.
00:45:36 There's only so much you can get.
00:45:38 Keep trying, man. Keep finding new ways.
00:45:40 What do you tell me there's some sort of secret
00:45:42 alternate nuts?
00:45:44 There's a secret alternative come.
00:45:46 I feel like it's knowing.
00:45:48 Oh my god.
00:45:50 I want the butt.
00:45:52 Where am I going to get my butt?
00:45:54 How do I cheat that?
00:45:56 Tell me how.
00:45:58 I'm stimulating my butt a lot.
00:46:00 You just hold the podcast. I've been stimulating
00:46:02 my butt and I've yet to butt come.
00:46:04 Please help me. Please teach me.
00:46:06 There's a lot of ways that you can come
00:46:08 emotionally.
00:46:10 What about my butt?
00:46:12 What are you talking about?
00:46:14 What are you talking about?
00:46:16 We're talking about ultimate nuts, Ben.
00:46:18 Keep the fuck up.
00:46:20 I don't even know what a nut is.
00:46:22 I feel like
00:46:24 what Digi might be getting at
00:46:26 is knowing that someone
00:46:28 truly cares about you
00:46:30 is good.
00:46:32 Let's not nut.
00:46:34 I assume.
00:46:36 The intimacy involved with sex
00:46:38 can lead to
00:46:40 emotions that rush through your brain
00:46:42 other than just the one that you feel
00:46:44 when you come.
00:46:46 You can get these different reactions.
00:46:48 Your brain can spike with chemicals
00:46:50 from the intimacy
00:46:52 of it rather than actually
00:46:54 from your dick coming out.
00:46:56 Digi.
00:46:58 I understand
00:47:00 what you're saying.
00:47:02 I know that
00:47:04 feeling.
00:47:06 The thing about that is that much like
00:47:08 the physicality
00:47:10 of sex and coming.
00:47:12 That is fleeting.
00:47:14 Have sex and then just pop out
00:47:16 and wait a few moments.
00:47:18 Instantaneously, all the pleasure you have
00:47:20 is gone.
00:47:22 It is only directly when you're doing the thing
00:47:24 and when you come for like 5 seconds
00:47:26 afterward that there is anything to do with it.
00:47:28 What I consider
00:47:30 when I reflect
00:47:32 on sex
00:47:34 I do not see
00:47:36 a morass of the same sex being had all the time.
00:47:38 I think about different
00:47:40 outfits that were being worn
00:47:42 or what positions were used
00:47:44 or what furniture was involved
00:47:46 or
00:47:48 what bodily fluids were spewed.
00:47:50 What threats were made
00:47:52 to induce it.
00:47:54 Did you?
00:47:56 Whereas you see different positions
00:47:58 and different outfits
00:48:00 I see different time stamp
00:48:02 numbers.
00:48:04 I see different amount of
00:48:06 numbers that have been consumed.
00:48:08 That is what I see.
00:48:10 I just look at that stuff as an aesthetic experience.
00:48:12 The same reason
00:48:14 when I watch anime movies for instance
00:48:16 I don't watch anime movies
00:48:18 because of the incredible
00:48:20 richness of thematic depth
00:48:22 and narrative. I would read books for that
00:48:24 if that was my main thing.
00:48:26 I like the aesthetics of anime and so
00:48:28 there is always going to be the aesthetic
00:48:30 experience of it is just enjoyable for me
00:48:32 to see this thing.
00:48:34 It's like a movie you really love
00:48:36 and it just looks great
00:48:38 and you're like fuck every image of this looks amazing
00:48:40 and I feel that way about sex.
00:48:42 I wanted to have all these different aesthetic experiences
00:48:44 and this time
00:48:46 we're wearing fucking schoolgirl outfits
00:48:48 and pretending to be lesbians.
00:48:50 Oh god.
00:48:52 Yeah exactly.
00:48:54 That's like an aesthetic experience though.
00:48:56 I'm actually
00:48:58 sympathetic to what you're saying here.
00:49:00 That hasn't happened by the way yet.
00:49:02 I don't believe it.
00:49:04 I hadn't thought of it until this time
00:49:06 but it was beautiful.
00:49:08 Again, I do not think that sex
00:49:10 is all bad or all good.
00:49:12 I agree that
00:49:14 I am not above the biology
00:49:16 of myself. I am not above
00:49:18 wanting to have sex and then
00:49:20 feeling good during
00:49:22 when sex is presently currently
00:49:24 happening right now.
00:49:26 I'm not above that. That feels good
00:49:28 and when you lift your loved one
00:49:30 it feels even better.
00:49:32 I'm just saying that sex takes up
00:49:34 way more time than I get out of it.
00:49:36 It does not even
00:49:38 remotely as good
00:49:40 for the amount of time
00:49:42 investment I get from playing Team Fortress 2
00:49:44 rather than having sex.
00:49:46 The amount of joy to hours I spend
00:49:48 is holocaustic.
00:49:50 Here's one
00:49:52 point I would make to the contrary of this
00:49:54 and I normally wouldn't make an argument like this
00:49:56 but I do think it applies in this case
00:49:58 honestly the best thing about sex for me
00:50:00 is making the other person
00:50:02 feel good. That is what I get out of it.
00:50:04 I get to experience them
00:50:06 enjoying it.
00:50:08 I completely agree.
00:50:10 I don't disagree with that.
00:50:12 There's a lot of good that comes from
00:50:14 that. The sex act
00:50:16 is only one aspect.
00:50:18 Then there's the appreciation
00:50:20 that you get from the person and the bond
00:50:22 that you form doing this extremely
00:50:24 intimate act that you can't share with anybody else
00:50:26 like a little private joke between the two of you
00:50:28 because sex is a joke. We all know this.
00:50:30 On that level
00:50:32 that's not really a tangible thing
00:50:34 but it's kind of an indirect
00:50:36 tangible benefit.
00:50:38 You're working on building your relationship
00:50:40 to some degree.
00:50:42 Obviously all these points are kind of
00:50:44 retreaded from famous
00:50:46 Listen Buddy Episode 1. Since Listen Buddy Episode 1
00:50:48 I have had sex
00:50:50 and I have spent many more hours of my life
00:50:52 ruminating thinking about since then
00:50:54 and I've come up with way more
00:50:56 nuanced approaches but because we're in this
00:50:58 hellfire podcast
00:51:00 I have to condense all my real points
00:51:02 and condense mimetic
00:51:04 rage totem pole beliefs
00:51:06 that I have to spread out before it interrupts me
00:51:08 mid-sentence
00:51:10 like every single thing I say.
00:51:12 I'm trying to help you
00:51:14 because I agree with you
00:51:16 that sex takes too much time.
00:51:18 I think that is the biggest problem
00:51:20 I have with it is simply that
00:51:22 I mean it's not to say that I'd rather
00:51:24 be doing anything else. It's just that
00:51:26 the amount of time makes it feel
00:51:28 like I'm not spending enough time on other things.
00:51:30 I literally have cut out podcasts
00:51:32 from my life entirely.
00:51:34 I just don't have time to fuck as much as I do
00:51:36 and also listen to podcasts.
00:51:38 You can just fuck while you're doing podcasts.
00:51:40 It's not while you're listening
00:51:42 while you're recording.
00:51:44 It's like talking about
00:51:46 some libertarian politics
00:51:48 or something while you're trying to fuck.
00:51:50 I'd rather just put on some trap music, you know?
00:51:52 Because I'm fucking a trap.
00:51:54 Do you have sex
00:51:56 with trap music in the background?
00:51:58 Dude, Denzel Curry is like
00:52:00 my main fuck music.
00:52:02 I'm gonna
00:52:04 come out. I'm gonna out myself.
00:52:06 It's possibly a weirdo. I don't know how weird this is
00:52:08 but I do not like music.
00:52:10 I do not put on music for sex.
00:52:12 I find it distracting.
00:52:14 I can't go my life without music
00:52:16 so I have to have it.
00:52:18 That's not true.
00:52:20 I feel like a lot of people do.
00:52:22 I've never really been into it.
00:52:24 Just not if I'm in the office.
00:52:26 Ben, I honestly
00:52:28 haven't experimented with listening enough
00:52:30 to music to know whether I find it weird or not
00:52:32 but I generally just don't even think to bother doing it.
00:52:34 Yeah, that's what it is.
00:52:36 When I think about putting it on, I'm like,
00:52:38 wouldn't that be distracting?
00:52:40 Well, here's the thing.
00:52:42 I was throwing up.
00:52:44 Oh, I put on Big Crit the other day.
00:52:46 I grew up
00:52:48 always wanted.
00:52:50 I had so many songs that I had listed as
00:52:52 these are my sex songs.
00:52:54 I have a playlist of sexy songs.
00:52:56 I had songs that I've had in mind
00:52:58 since I first heard them when I was 14
00:53:00 that I'm like, I want to fuck to this song.
00:53:02 So immediately
00:53:04 the first time that I had sex
00:53:06 with May, I was like, put together this playlist
00:53:08 before we even started.
00:53:10 I need to hear these songs.
00:53:12 What's one song on there? I'm curious.
00:53:14 Come On Over Turned Me On by Mark Lannigan
00:53:16 and Isabelle Campbell was the first
00:53:18 thing on my list.
00:53:20 Prom Night by Anna Monoguchi was on there.
00:53:22 Oh yeah, that's a good one.
00:53:24 That one's more of a make out song though
00:53:26 than a fucking song, honestly.
00:53:28 There are two things
00:53:30 that I've wanted to do when I've gotten
00:53:32 a girlfriend.
00:53:34 I feel it coming by
00:53:36 that's a great one.
00:53:40 Fucking Christ, there have been
00:53:42 two things I've wanted to do when I get a girlfriend.
00:53:44 One of them did you that mean you have Bond Over.
00:53:46 Number one, play Kirby's Epic Yarn.
00:53:48 Co-op.
00:53:50 Because of Game Grumps.
00:53:52 Number two...
00:53:54 Is that when John and Aaron cemented their love?
00:53:56 Danny and Aaron?
00:53:58 Same, same.
00:54:00 And the second one
00:54:02 was from Raising Gazorpazorp
00:54:04 from Rick and Morty
00:54:06 when Morty rushes down and drinks an entire
00:54:08 carton of orange juice after coming.
00:54:10 I've always wanted to do those two things.
00:54:14 Doesn't he really? That's amazing.
00:54:16 Yeah, yeah.
00:54:18 And I can see you doing that too.
00:54:20 And then you run right back up
00:54:22 and the noise begins again.
00:54:24 Exactly, exactly.
00:54:26 I've not achieved, but I'll keep you
00:54:28 posted.
00:54:30 I feel bad, I feel bad.
00:54:32 All those people in the comments.
00:54:34 Just please post a single tweet with a single orange
00:54:36 in the body of the tweet.
00:54:38 We'll know.
00:54:40 I'm sorry to all of those people
00:54:42 who have broken the pack.
00:54:44 I'm still on your side.
00:54:46 In fact, this just strengthens my case.
00:54:48 This just makes me more a champion of the people.
00:54:50 You have to dab on the dark arts
00:54:52 to know how to defeat them.
00:54:54 You have to understand your enemy before you can take them down.
00:54:56 Just think about it that way.
00:54:58 I haven't turned.
00:55:00 I haven't flipped my heel upside down
00:55:02 and slipped my banana heel.
00:55:04 No, it's true.
00:55:06 When I think about this argument
00:55:08 the way you're presenting it,
00:55:10 if there was a magical switch before me
00:55:12 that would just turn off my need
00:55:14 for sex.
00:55:16 At this point in my life, I would absolutely do it.
00:55:18 And I would just be like, now I can just be productive
00:55:20 all the time, nothing to worry about.
00:55:22 Can you turn it on again?
00:55:24 Well, I don't know.
00:55:26 If I could turn it off and on, I would keep it off
00:55:28 most of the time.
00:55:30 This is a need for sex, not the capacity for sex.
00:55:32 This is a need for sex, not the capacity.
00:55:34 Okay, then yeah.
00:55:36 Honestly, it would have implications for my life.
00:55:38 I don't think it would change.
00:55:40 If I only turned off the need and not the capacity
00:55:42 I don't know if it would change enough.
00:55:44 Well, see, that's interesting.
00:55:46 Because most of the sex I have is because
00:55:48 I don't want to do anything else.
00:55:50 We live in a fucking frozen
00:55:52 nightmare world where there's nowhere to go.
00:55:56 So most of what we do is stay inside.
00:55:58 My life is like this.
00:56:00 I want every fucking second
00:56:02 I can have to work on my
00:56:04 extremely backed up catalog of
00:56:06 projects that I have in the pipe.
00:56:08 So for me, a single second
00:56:10 I can spend more on that.
00:56:12 That's how I feel.
00:56:14 I feel as though I wish I didn't have
00:56:16 to spend as much time on that as I do.
00:56:18 I already am spending so much time
00:56:20 working and trying to get through all these projects
00:56:22 and I wish that my projects were like
00:56:24 one of them had enough impact
00:56:26 that I didn't have to do them
00:56:28 all the fucking time.
00:56:30 But that's the world we're in.
00:56:32 Digi, do you think your life's going to
00:56:34 change at all when you're in a not
00:56:36 nightmare snow hellscape?
00:56:38 Do you think that's going to change anything?
00:56:40 Or do you think you're cemented in this?
00:56:42 We were going out a lot more
00:56:44 before winter started.
00:56:46 It's just a matter of
00:56:48 our house is a little out of the way
00:56:50 and
00:56:52 it snows almost constantly throughout the winter
00:56:54 so we have to dig out the car
00:56:56 out from under the snow every time you want to
00:56:58 so it's like
00:57:00 even taking a five minute drive to
00:57:02 McDonald's is a chilling effect.
00:57:04 Exactly.
00:57:06 I got the emotional nut
00:57:08 when I made the joke.
00:57:10 It only just like three days ago
00:57:12 finally stopped being snow every day
00:57:14 and now it's kind of getting normal
00:57:16 and we've gone out more
00:57:18 but it's just like
00:57:20 there's lots of things I like doing
00:57:22 but there's only so many that you can do
00:57:24 in the same day.
00:57:26 Gone out to eat, gone shopping
00:57:28 or something, like done something outside
00:57:30 that's fun, maybe gone for a walk
00:57:32 or something, you know
00:57:34 and then you get online, you do all your social media
00:57:36 shit, you checked Twitter, you checked your comments
00:57:38 you've caught up on whatever YouTube videos
00:57:40 are out, alright now it's time to work
00:57:42 alright I've worked to the exhaustion capacity
00:57:44 of my brain
00:57:46 so where do I fill in the other like
00:57:48 four hours that are there in the day
00:57:50 that normally I would just sit there
00:57:52 and listen to podcasts.
00:57:54 I don't want to fill that time with more work
00:57:56 because I don't think I work well
00:57:58 when I'm like forcing myself
00:58:00 I tend to
00:58:02 follow the flow of whatever I'm inspired
00:58:04 to work on at the moment
00:58:06 and if I'm not inspired to work on anything at the moment
00:58:08 I can't work
00:58:10 I don't get writer's block
00:58:12 I just do
00:58:14 go between
00:58:16 if I don't feel like
00:58:18 writing any anime videos
00:58:20 I'll make a song
00:58:22 or vice versa
00:58:24 Hey, I think Gib was going to say something
00:58:26 Yeah, okay, yeah
00:58:28 Here's my
00:58:30 sex music
00:58:38 I got to try that
00:58:40 actually
00:58:42 Do it immediately
00:58:44 Will you think of Sansa? Will you think of
00:58:46 Riska?
00:58:48 I'm disappointed
00:58:50 Disappointing in what's happened here today. I was bragging my stuff. I was smirking. I was smiling ear to shining ear
00:58:56 I was thinking about how I was going. This was gonna be my magnum opus
00:59:00 Everyone's gonna remember my performance here on this procrastinator's podcast episode, but but I floundered
00:59:06 I've just repeat what I've said in an attempt to to spit out my ideals in a completely un-nuanced
00:59:13 Unpragmatic fucking retarded way and now people will just remember me as the guy who just is repeating listen buddy topics
00:59:19 Even though and though I have thousands of words here
00:59:21 They they they were completely squandered and wasted and to go back and read them again would just be trained old
00:59:27 Again in this topic. So I'm disappointed and I'm upset. I think your main point. I I
00:59:33 Completely agree with I wish sex took up less time and I think that really is the ultimate point
00:59:39 You're trying to make here. That's that's a utilitarian point and I completely agree with it. I also have that exact same desire. I
00:59:46 Don't know
00:59:49 I
00:59:51 Turns out that when you're not when you're like arguing like and the people have like an actual defense lined up that they've been
00:59:58 Considering ever since here
01:00:01 You are you would be fucking banned from ever serving in a town council or any degree of
01:00:08 Citizenship you would be fucking exiled for your display here on this podcast for ruining my stone cold
01:00:15 defense
01:00:37 Do we want to bring up migtails at all
01:00:42 I kind of do what is it what is a migtail?
01:00:46 Dictionary can help a modern-day hero, but let's find out
01:00:49 Let's find out do you remember when me you and they got mad each other or me you and being a match other rad con too
01:00:55 But migtails, absolutely. We had a big argument. What video was that and that was in the
01:01:03 It was in a blue glow. Yeah, it's on it's on a blue glow some way
01:01:07 Here's the okay. Here's the definition of migtail top definition on her dictionary men going their own way
01:01:12 Migtail is a statement of self ownership where the modern man preserves and protects his own sovereignty. Okay, this guy's obviously a migtail
01:01:21 It is the manifestation of one word. No. Oh my god. I'm getting inspired now eject
01:01:28 Preconceptions and cultural definitions of what a man in quotations is looking to no one else for social cues
01:01:35 Refusing to bow serve and kneel for the opportunity to be the dream is like
01:01:42 According to his own best interest in a world, which would rather he didn't guys parents
01:01:48 Are you gonna get married and buy a house and start a family guy answers? No?
01:01:55 This is me I am the proudest migtail who's ever lived
01:02:01 Guy guy writing this nobody said you have to have a girlfriend. Okay, this guy
01:02:06 You know, he's drunk the Kool-Aid in a big way. That's fine
01:02:10 Okay, here. I'll break this down super easy migtails see the very real challenge that is presented in society
01:02:17 That is like a pressure to get a girlfriend and like judges you if you don't get one and they're just like this system is unfair
01:02:23 I like don't like it. I think it's not helpful. I choose to not engage in it
01:02:28 And then they just like sidestep it which which honestly morally there is no problem with that morally that that's completely
01:02:34 Unobjectionable people are allowed to do whatever they want. Yeah, but practically. I don't get why it's yeah
01:02:39 It's it's a weird label because it just gives people something to laugh at when they look at you
01:02:46 Now they're not laughing at the fact that you don't have sex. It's now that they're laughing at the fact that you're a crazy man
01:02:54 I don't think someone's deciding not to have sex is completely crazy to be militant about it
01:03:00 Like a lot of actually do a lot of migtails are into kind of like the pump and dump mentality
01:03:06 We're the like they'll fuck women like they there's still many want to have sex
01:03:08 But like they don't want to shackle themselves with like a wife or you know a girlfriend or whatever get out of town
01:03:24 I mean I again, I don't think being identitarian about it makes is like a healthy thing to do
01:03:29 But like there is definitely a real like a migtail is kind of like a feminist like they recognize
01:03:36 Some injustices in the world or what they perceive to be injustices and they choose to like specifically
01:03:41 Oppose those and like reject these certain things and this is just the label to indicate that in this case
01:03:46 These people are rejecting like society's pressure to like get a girlfriend and possibly have sex
01:03:51 just like you know, maybe they'll just want to be you know jack off all the time or whatever some some certainly do that and
01:03:56 It makes sense, but I just don't think it's productive
01:03:59 This is a very much a mentality of you know the opposite of what I say, you know
01:04:04 These person want lighter burdens as opposed to broader shoulders without a doubt. That's definitely what this means
01:04:10 They're like we were we reject this challenge of society and think it is unfair, which it is which it is not like a morally
01:04:17 Justifiable position for people to put on you because you have no obligation to marry or reproduce morally speaking
01:04:23 There is absolutely none, but in a practical sense there is an impetus to do so
01:04:27 Which is why I certainly can't agree with this well because if you don't reproduce
01:04:33 Yeah, because we want more humans. We want more people to do stuff and like
01:04:38 What if you're retarded?
01:04:40 Well, but I mean just a perfect utilitarian position to say ah my genes are bad
01:04:45 I'm not gonna reproduce that but if your genes are fine, then you should and
01:04:51 Definitely retarded so no okay reproducing is about more than just genes if you
01:04:56 Like even if you have fucking leukemia if you reproduce and you have a kid who also has leukemia
01:05:01 But you are just a badass like
01:05:04 Entrepreneurial motherfucker who like achieve so much you will instill those values in your kid to some degree and like that will be a
01:05:10 Better person than some like welfare, baby, you know like I don't know piece of shit asshole who just was like my life's somebody help me
01:05:17 You know so like there there's values outside of just genetics well that you can improve
01:05:21 I feel like like if if say if you want from a practical
01:05:27 practical
01:05:28 Perspective you want the people who are good at adding to society to reproduce
01:05:35 So that they will instill values in the children
01:05:38 Surely the people who are too weak to step up to the challenge don't we don't need them anyway? I
01:05:45 Hear what you're saying on that print the only way I even sort of disagree is just like I just don't think that like the
01:05:50 Getting the mig town message is actually a helpful thing because there's gonna be some people on the fence probably who could have gone
01:05:57 One way or another and then like maybe if this wasn't a movement
01:06:00 They would have gone the other way and then like yeah at themselves and risen to the challenge, you know
01:06:04 But I would also say that the opposite is like some people who don't who have like terrible
01:06:09 They they reproduced
01:06:12 Despite their flaws as character as like members of society that add to it
01:06:17 Like yeah, they just happen to be in a place where sex is easy to get because everyone's easy or whatever
01:06:23 Like like white trash play. Well, I just don't think that the MGTOW like identity or movement is actually the best for the people in it
01:06:30 I think what is best for them is to adopt an attitude where like self-improvement
01:06:35 They accept that that's their responsibility to obtain
01:06:38 Happiness and what they want in their life and then to work towards it as opposed to just like you know saying like oh society's fucked
01:06:44 I choose not to engage in it because like they're the ones who are gonna suffer ultimately for doing that. So
01:06:49 Yeah, I think it is
01:06:51 Irresponsible to just simply want more babies. I think we want more babies who have good parents
01:06:58 If we had the same amount of humans, but just all of them were smart
01:07:03 That would be that would be way better than just having like like, you know, 25% more population
01:07:08 But we can't actually control that though. I mean, I'd certainly like to
01:07:14 If we're yeah, there's definitely ways to improve that if we focus more of our efforts on making people better instead of just having
01:07:22 There be more people but you know like like like you know again not promoting just having babies
01:07:28 Okay, but you don't have to only do one of those things
01:07:30 It's not like one comes to the exclusion of the other and and on another level like practically speaking
01:07:36 Economies need growth in the population to grow
01:07:39 So like there is just an intrinsic good for an economy when there is population growth
01:07:44 You know, obviously to a saturation point, but that varies from place to place
01:07:47 You know America is nowhere near as crowded as India Japan like in the cities etc. Etc. There's plenty of room to grow
01:07:53 Population like economies need this sort of stuff, but God, I don't fucking care about this. Let's talk about something else
01:07:58 This is this is
01:08:02 I was interested in just talking about migtails in the context of like people who
01:08:06 Like there's the sexual it's the same stuff. We were talking about before like there is a sexual impetus on men like to go out and conquer and
01:08:13 You know like get sex because then they'll be thought of as cool guys and migtails like reject that and I
01:08:19 Morally speaking make sense what they say. I cannot refuse house. We're about having sex
01:08:25 But not all of them. There's there's there's subdivisions within the Migtail move. It's a fractured a fractured
01:08:31 Sad
01:08:33 divided
01:08:35 Why would you call yourself a migtail if you're not the one of the crazy ones?
01:08:38 Like it's like calling yourself a brony if you just watch the show people are going to assume you're a pedophile as well
01:08:43 Because it's fun to label. I mean, that's my argument about literally all labels like
01:08:48 Like why would like that's right? Like there's a lot of people who want to try to like reclaim labels
01:08:53 I think that's the problem is like the reclamation like people who
01:08:57 You know insist on calling themselves like like oh
01:09:01 I am a feminist because I'm I'm in favor of like, you know women having equal rights
01:09:05 And it's like well most people when they hear that word don't think that's what you're about
01:09:08 You know so like you might as well like move on to a new term, you know
01:09:12 Like that's how I feel about like pretty much any label is eventually it's gonna get diluted
01:09:17 And it's gonna seem like the the most extreme part of it is like what people associate with it, you know
01:09:22 Yeah, I think
01:09:23 Identitarianism of any type is the largest problem in humanity. I think it is the root cause of so many issues
01:09:30 I'm a big
01:09:34 By the way, well just well
01:09:38 Shout out. Yes. Here's a song that my girlfriend likes to sing
01:09:42 Welcome to my life as a female make towel. Welcome to my life. Yeah, thank you. I was laughing about it
01:09:49 But it was really funny. I like it. It's good though my female make towel life
01:09:55 Okay
01:09:59 And so I had
01:10:03 Inseminate it into that's right. I had to impregnate this podcast
01:10:08 The core make towel belief again is something that like like I I I do believe that it is not I again as I've been saying
01:10:16 I don't think I don't think society should pressure people into thinking that sex is just inherently like like as as you know
01:10:23 Important as we now think of it, you know, I think it's perfectly fine to not want to participate in it
01:10:29 But you know, I'll be like like obviously, you know
01:10:32 They have like a somewhat reasonable idea if you take the most mundane aspects of it
01:10:37 But you know, they're they're militant. They're warriors. They're SJW is in their own, right? And that is
01:10:43 You know in a sense in a sense
01:10:45 Yeah, I sense in a sex. I have zoned out. I
01:10:51 Think we're pretty much at the tail end here. Are there any final points to make? Yeah
01:10:55 Here are my testimonials for what I've said earlier today. Here's testimonials for what I've said
01:11:01 I'm on team munchie Ben St
01:11:03 I got to say munchies argument were a lot more convincing even though I've previously enjoyed sex in the past
01:11:08 I'm starting to reconsider its merits. Wait, wait, who's saying this?
01:11:11 Whose words are these high sex campaign? Did you Ben St said this? Wait, I did not say it's you
01:11:19 To me again
01:11:21 My name is about me then Ben you said I'm on this is on the the the
01:11:26 Collins I'm listening play episode one. I'm on team. Oh, then Digi bro says I gotta say munchies arguments were a lot more convincing
01:11:33 Even though I've previously enjoyed sex in the past. I'm starting to reconsider its merits
01:11:37 They consider joining munchies anti-sex campaign. Okay for what it's as you can see in that video
01:11:42 I'm tainted by recent insatiable lust for them dawn
01:11:47 Fibrom high heel penis
01:11:48 Drubbings your opinions have been laid bare if you were to go back on them now
01:11:53 You will be changing your mind and your credibility would be shot down instantaneously
01:11:56 Oh
01:11:58 Damn
01:11:59 Bro is so known for having consistent
01:12:03 Because he's totally not known for being a flip flopper on literally everything
01:12:07 Yeah, but the problem is that he talks with so much authority and that's a big problem
01:12:11 I
01:12:17 Will delete yourself from real life so so so you so you heard it from Digi bro sex is all bad you heard you heard it here
01:12:24 Yeah, there it is. We've settled the question all bad
01:12:27 You got my vote have a stronger argument in that podcast
01:12:30 Which is why why I said about a hashtag assassinate President Trump so that his son munchie J
01:12:36 Trump can rise to the throne and
01:12:39 And hence outlaw
01:12:41 Sex that's what I want. It's the only way we can make this happen. That's the only avenue available to us at this moment
01:12:54 That was a problem for me
01:12:55 Yeah, we need to upturn that apple cart and really go back to basics of you know
01:13:00 enslaving you know
01:13:02 Everyone that's what I want
01:13:04 I
01:13:06 Hope you still like us everyone. I hope you still enjoy us. I hope you still enjoy our company
01:13:10 I hope you haven't left. I hope you haven't thought that we've gone downhill and they've been jacking their little baby dicks this whole fucking time
01:13:16 This has been a dream come true for that. Yeah, this podcast has been great
01:13:21 Well, there you go. Are we are we reading comments? It's time for comments. It's time
01:13:27 The the moment has come
01:13:30 Okay, here we go at Lobotnist. Oh, wait, you know, this is a great question
01:13:33 Is there a death? Oh, right at Lobotnist
01:13:36 Is there a death pool for the IRL Radcon 3 arena and how did you bet explain that pool?
01:13:42 What is this man's talking about a dead death pool is when so so at fucking Radcon 3 funded happening
01:13:50 There will be the the fucking Radcon 3 arena IRL where we shoot each other with real
01:13:56 real
01:13:57 Deadly nerf bullets do we fire arms and and there has been no betting pool, but there should be stakes
01:14:04 He's right. There should be stakes to this event. Yeah, absolutely add some sort of you know
01:14:11 Loser doesn't get to eat the steak dinner
01:14:14 Stakes
01:14:16 The dinner has to make dinner
01:14:19 The losers to make dinner for the rest of the people but there's but everyone's a loser
01:14:23 All the losers have to make the most decadent dinner for the one winner
01:14:27 How about like at the dinner like like like how about everyone eats?
01:14:31 But like the winner like it arranged in order of like winner like the winner gets the most sumptuous banquet and the loser
01:14:38 Yeah, and we're like arranged at the table from like winner to loser. Yeah, I don't know
01:14:42 I think there should be some kind of hierarchy based on
01:14:45 On how to perform all just instantly like conclusion. Yes, they like the reward will be dinner related
01:14:54 Instantly I like it. I think it's a good
01:14:58 Like how about like um, I don't know maybe like they're become like for one day
01:15:02 There's like a chain of command or something and like like everyone has to like
01:15:07 Let's get let's get real sexy with it and be like the losers. The losers have to do whatever the winner
01:15:16 Emotional
01:15:19 Oh
01:15:20 Yeah, you just have to just shower me with compliments. You just have to shower me everyone gathers in the circle
01:15:25 It just jacks off their emotions onto my face. I want that. That's when I win. That's what I'm going to ask
01:15:31 Or maybe I don't know we could we could bet something like we could bet something not money
01:15:36 I want the loser to suffer and die
01:15:42 What about betting our
01:15:44 Subscriber
01:15:49 Everyone puts up everyone bets subscribers
01:15:51 Yeah, we've all got 10k I think or like around there and then we trans like we transfer them to the winner like based on some mysterious
01:15:59 Process we have yet to
01:16:03 That'd be great by the way, everybody just in case you hadn't noticed
01:16:07 I don't know if I said this before did we talk before about how fucking the we are max reviving t-bap
01:16:13 It fucking happened did that that get brought up last episode? No, because we didn't know no
01:16:18 But I got some related questions I can ask such as thalamus dred from our patreon
01:16:25 Exclusive discord group asking how do you feel about the Kickstarter doing as incredibly as it did even reaching there you go
01:16:31 You never thought I would make
01:16:33 It's unbelievable. That was literally a joke. It was literally a joke
01:16:39 $9,001 to max revive t-bap, but we thanks for the money guys
01:16:42 And we will use it how to make rad con as dope as fucking possible how I feel about it doing as incredibly as it did is that I
01:16:49 Probably fucked up really bad by not reading any of the discussion that happened around rad con 3 at all
01:16:57 Or what any of the stretch goals were and so therefore I did not at any point raise my voice and say hey
01:17:02 Let's make a stretch goal so that we just get paid
01:17:06 To do this like I'm like a stretch goal of like
01:17:09 $5,000 higher than what we need to make it possible and then that's the money that just goes to us
01:17:16 As a matter of fact that already is kind of in the thing like it's in the thing that yeah
01:17:20 Whatever money is just left over after the thing. It just gets given to us
01:17:24 I am gonna spend it on rad con as much as possible
01:17:28 Because yeah, yeah, I made the mistake of only saying and it would cost me a hundred dollars because I was travel cost
01:17:35 But because I decided I want to stay in a hotel instead
01:17:38 I will definitely be operating at a gigantic loss for rad con 3 if I had known that it was gonna make so much money
01:17:44 I would have just asked for more money to go
01:17:46 I would have been like oh I cost three hundred dollars down here or however
01:17:50 No, we have actually given you money for a hotel outside of rad con
01:17:54 I would have just told you that my travel cost was three hundred dollars and line and okay
01:18:00 Or like three hundred dollars for it to be worth it for me to come like well there you go
01:18:04 You know there you go, but I'm glad we can have you on board. I'm glad
01:18:09 You're a credit to the force
01:18:12 Okay, what else is going on?
01:18:15 No, that's bad what at Doombox 2 asks. What's the most underrated thing?
01:18:22 What's the most underrated thing?
01:18:25 Sex the the core of the earth under
01:18:30 Homestuck
01:18:32 Homestuck, yeah
01:18:34 I mean it's highly rated, but not nearly enough. It's definitely underrated compared to the cultural like force that it is
01:18:41 Like I think that's true. It should be recognized as being one of the greats
01:18:46 You know like the fans the fans love it, but nobody else. Yeah
01:18:50 Nobody who has like anybody who hasn't read Homestuck and is not a big fan thinks it is like literally they just be on their
01:18:57 Comprehension like that's really gonna watch our machine will we use right into it fucking check out arm retrieval
01:19:02 I'm retrieval con 3 was funded by the way guys. I'm sure the con 3 is definitely gonna happen
01:19:07 That's right, and Steve are gonna be there fucking dope as hell check out our retrieval
01:19:13 Incredible, okay. I got another question for y'all. This is from a horse power
01:19:17 He asks what's the biggest project you ever wanted to make but don't have the know-how yet or time?
01:19:23 Mmm the know-how or time and not the money or resources
01:19:28 Yeah, like you literally you don't know how to make this thing and that's why you haven't made it a
01:19:33 Musical I would like to make a musical that is what I know on the stage on the stage. Yep
01:19:39 That's it for me. It's an ARG. I
01:19:42 Is that gonna be the revival of Tbap? That's what yeah Tbap IRL is gonna be. I
01:19:48 I
01:19:49 Want to keep doing small Japanese Juggalo ARG so I can grind my skills to make an actually good real
01:19:57 That's a good idea. I want to make an actual real marble hornets
01:20:01 The only problem is like the one problem that I have with trying to do a marble hornet
01:20:06 Is that eventually like you know one day I will have the patreon and okay?
01:20:10 Here's my problem with marble hornets. I can't fucking wait hold on
01:20:13 Okay, but I can't like just be like here's my new series guys. It's my horror ARG
01:20:19 I can't get an ounce that it is an ARG. Yeah, that doesn't work
01:20:22 So it's you know
01:20:23 How am I going to let people know that I'm not doing nothing and let them know of my new content?
01:20:28 You gotta wait for that like you need that frog fractions word-of-mouth. It's the only way
01:20:33 It's the only way dude. What if what if this was like a like a secret hint and it's already out. Oh
01:20:39 Oh
01:20:42 Yeah, by the way my
01:20:44 No, I was gonna say I've also tried to launch ARGs a bunch of times or like tried to work on them
01:20:48 But it is like daunting to make it like big enough to be like noteworthy, you know
01:20:54 Yeah, especially because you're risking nobody giving a shit, right exactly like when I was working on one
01:21:00 Like what was it two years ago when I was trying like really trying to launch this ARG
01:21:04 And I made a whole ton of footage for it for all these different videos and stuff
01:21:08 And then I was just like the amount of time it will take to complete this like for a chance that no one
01:21:14 Finishes this like no one sees all this footage. It's just like I can't take that risk, you know
01:21:20 Did you you you helped create the Japanese juggle ARG the most successful ARG of all time?
01:21:25 Something to be celebrated for it there. I
01:21:28 I want to learn like you need to know how in the time to actually produce a good rock album
01:21:36 That isn't just a bunch of me fucking around with guitars and not knowing and or caring how to record properly
01:21:42 Mm-hmm, like I want to do it right. I want to actually have like songs
01:21:47 That's what I want hippo think about it
01:21:49 You have two unique skills and no other PCP PCP people do you have 2d?
01:21:55 Animation skills and you have music skills that those are two unique. Oh, I guess did you actually never mind never mind
01:22:02 I mean, he is a reviewer. He's not an animator. Yeah, okay, that's true
01:22:10 For Ben what about you? I think maybe like the ultimate magnum opus and I have no plans for this at the point
01:22:16 This is just off the top of my head
01:22:17 but some kind of like some kind of like big like
01:22:21 comprehensive like
01:22:23 Volume or tome kind of like like House of Leaves or something but like, you know, obviously there'd be illustrations
01:22:29 So I'm thinking something like Jimmy Corrigan the smartest kid on earth that has like, you know, a big like a big like
01:22:36 Dance like, you know world and characters and history. That's all kind of like, you know, just all all in one big
01:22:42 Volume that might be something
01:22:46 Someday thinking about my answer to this the problem is that like it's the biggest problem you've ever wanted to make
01:22:52 So that would just be some video game
01:22:53 I wanted to make as a kid because obviously that's like I think video games like the biggest
01:22:58 projects that are like in modern media probably yeah, but like as for
01:23:07 Currently like biggest project I want to make but don't have to know how yet would just be any masterpiece
01:23:13 Like I just want to know that I've made a masterpiece that people recognize as a masterpiece
01:23:18 And I just don't think I am good enough to do that yet, you know
01:23:22 But what would that masterpiece look like? I don't know like it could be a YouTube video
01:23:28 Yeah, it could be I don't know like what by what means I have it in me to create something that would be like recognized
01:23:34 The way like infinite jest is recognized, you know, like well
01:23:38 What what well digi your dream is a farce piece you already made a masterpiece measurement man on modal
01:23:47 On a tangent about infinite jest for a second, okay
01:23:50 Something okay, this is not like a new observation, but it's something that I've like come to terms with okay
01:23:56 Well, like when I first was introduced to infinite jest it was like oh
01:23:59 It's this big complicated work and everyone's like in awe of its like sheer size and scope and I was like whoa neat and
01:24:06 I mean the more I've thought about it
01:24:08 It took me like two years to read and I was like, okay, that was pretty neat
01:24:11 I get it but the more I've thought about it the more I think that really the reason it's famous is not
01:24:15 Because of what it is. I mean what it is is noteworthy and people probably would have taken note
01:24:19 But I really think that it's just because of the reputation the DFW had and like I think the fact
01:24:26 That he made it and the people knew him and that this was coming from him was probably was like a really big part of
01:24:32 Where it's like the recognition for it came from it's hard to I mean anything that fucking out there like you have to be known
01:24:39 You know like James Joyce's Ulysses would not be famous if James Joyce hadn't already been famous, you know
01:24:44 Yeah, which is it that's like it's it that's like I guess that's true of everything that like things get notorious like based on like
01:24:51 You know like the notoriety of their creator and that's just like an inherent thing like people are attached to be the names and identities and stuff, but
01:25:00 Is your is your point kind of that the book is a little bit less deserving of all the discussion in praise
01:25:05 I think there's a lot of legitimate
01:25:08 Criticism you could have with a book like the book is really like sure like it's known for its size and scope and those are undeniable
01:25:14 But like it's pretty fucking meandering a lot of the time and like messy and sloppy and paced really weird
01:25:20 Which is I guess is kind of inevitable with something that size
01:25:24 But like you know those are real problems
01:25:26 I think you could I think you could reasonably argue that it isn't the masterpiece that everyone says I don't know if I
01:25:31 Necessarily don't think that it is but I think there's an argument against it
01:25:36 To go on a tangent from your tangent the only thing that's made me want to read
01:25:42 Infant jest is is knowing that the author killed himself
01:25:46 It made me think like wow, he's not like a pussy like he's actually killed
01:25:55 He's like he like says he's like much or something and I didn't like whatever like author is say like oh
01:26:01 I'm depressed and they're believing but like he actually killed himself. He was actually depressed like wow
01:26:08 You gotta look into the Japanese author Mishima
01:26:11 I don't remember his first name
01:26:12 But he was a guy who like wrote about like the aesthetic beauty of like the human body and everything
01:26:17 He was like a big workout dude big like body improvement guy
01:26:21 But he was also radically anti-government and like he literally this is just an author
01:26:26 But he like like led an attack on like a military base
01:26:30 Like killed a bunch of people and like made demands that like they like shut down the government
01:26:36 And of course they didn't so he committed seppuku and
01:26:39 Chop his head off. This isn't like the 60s. Holy shit. Yeah
01:26:43 It's it's crazy when like people like people like go on to do real things
01:26:52 Yeah
01:26:55 Doing like they're these are just people that write stuff they write fiction like there was um
01:26:59 There's a one-hit wonderland about a beds are burning by some Australian band and like it turns out that it's like a political
01:27:05 It was like a very politically motivated band and like now that guy is like part of the Australian like parliament or some shit
01:27:11 And he's like people underestimate like how much like I think there is a lot of people who do music and stuff like that
01:27:17 Who might actually have more insight into what's going on?
01:27:20 And that's why they're doing art is that they're trying to let people in on like they're trying to fucking woke you
01:27:25 You know with you know what this is actually great. I'm glad we get on to this cuz like okay
01:27:29 Here's a problem. I have with guys like like fucking a nerd writer
01:27:34 Nerd writer will spend his whole life writing about how much you should feel like oh this thing is so special
01:27:39 It's so important
01:27:40 But like what the fuck is he gonna actually do to like achieve any of this shit?
01:27:45 He's talking about like I feel a pain every day that I am not a scientist or an engineer
01:27:51 Currently working to like make better rockets to get human beings into space it
01:27:56 It consumes me that I am like just a guy talking about anime and like I talk about the themes that like so I'm no better
01:28:02 I'm no better than this guy, but like with him because he's so popular
01:28:05 It's just he's just like giving people these emotions to like feel a certain way and to me
01:28:10 It's really cheap and but my core message behind everything I do is improve yourself
01:28:15 Fucking lift weights eat healthy be a better man
01:28:18 You know or women whatever and achieve something with your life and all I think about is is what I'm doing right now
01:28:25 Actually making the world a better place
01:28:27 Probably not and that really fucks me up and then you know, so like I'm thinking about like am I really?
01:28:34 Passing along the message. I actually really sincerely care about passing on to people about self-improvement and you know
01:28:41 whatever like I get out of stories like ghosts in the shell and
01:28:45 A gurren login like important themes. I think I want people to really hear I want them to actually think about what the fuck
01:28:51 I'm talking about
01:28:53 You know, I mean I mean I care I care that I'm not doing that pisses me off
01:28:58 I feel similarly, but I I look at my um
01:29:01 Cuz I constantly get messages from people that are like, you know
01:29:04 Oh, you were an inspiration for me to do whatever and like sometimes it's something. I'm like cool
01:29:08 I'm glad you were inspired to do that sometimes
01:29:10 I'm like maybe you shouldn't be inspired to make a YouTube channel if you're you know not gonna be dedicated to it and do a good job
01:29:18 He's probably my mortgage my house to be just like you exactly
01:29:22 If you do if you something like that, I'm like no be careful, you know
01:29:27 But like because I do inspire people and a lot of people have just told me things like you know
01:29:33 Your videos help me get through the day or like I don't want to kill myself anymore because your podcast came out
01:29:38 I'm like sick so to me. I'm like, okay
01:29:41 I'm clearly doing a service for humanity in that sense
01:29:43 But then I can also go into my watch time like my total watch time and it's like
01:29:49 100 years of human life or exactly
01:29:52 Exactly, and I'm just like, okay
01:29:54 Well, have I have I inspired enough people to like make up for how many have died just watching
01:30:02 Claimed an entire human life in a half. I've claimed like six. Hold on. I gotta go look at the actual number
01:30:07 It was something like please pull that number up
01:30:09 It was several human lives with the best comments
01:30:12 I get occasionally I'll get like tweets or whatever about people saying like dude you videos inspired me
01:30:17 I have lost like a hundred pounds because I took responsibility for my life. I have where I just got a message like that the other day
01:30:23 That like what a fucking hero that guy is and I am so happy that I actually made a fucking difference in the world
01:30:29 It actually meant something the shit that I say that is what actually matters
01:30:33 The people about making people feel good a little bit. That's fine. All I care about is actual results
01:30:38 Okay, they're being achieved by the shit. Yeah, what do you got? What's your number?
01:30:41 My total watch time for the Digi bro channel is 618 years
01:30:45 There you go. That's like six or seven lives. Maybe more depend. Yeah, I mean if we're the 75
01:30:52 What what's the current fucking like life? I don't know
01:30:56 That's like eight to nine ten lives. Whatever's ten lives. I think it's like high 70s seventy
01:31:02 74 are we doing another question?
01:31:04 Well, wait what I want to say was like the most important thing is it gives sometimes says this give has made videos about this very point
01:31:10 And I think it is so true
01:31:12 It's that like inspiration is fleeting
01:31:14 Inspiration is fleeting all that matters to me is that the people act on inspiration and actually start to make changes in their life
01:31:21 And do something if people watch my fucking galco video and like you're like a hot slut
01:31:25 Who's like, why is everyone so mean to me? Why is everyone, you know, like why can't people just appreciate that?
01:31:29 I'm a nice girl and then they watch my video and they're like yay someone like the hot girls can be nice like okay
01:31:35 Great, but how are you gonna change your life?
01:31:36 How are you gonna be a better person as a result of this?
01:31:38 That's what matters, but Gib here is completely right in his videos where he says like this is such a fleeting thing
01:31:44 You'll watch this video you'll forget about it like 99% of people it won't make any fucking difference in the world
01:31:48 And I feel like nerd writer shit captain Christian shit and and me and me
01:31:53 Well, that's that's like most of what it is disposable like positive feelings
01:31:58 But like guys like Elon Musk like Elon Musk founds SpaceX is like, okay, let's make rockets
01:32:04 I want to hire people to make rockets. Oh
01:32:06 No one exists in the world qualified to make the rockets. I want to like advance the human race
01:32:11 Okay, luckily I personally am willing to work to understand this
01:32:15 So he becomes the own lead engineer for SpaceX because no one in the world was good enough
01:32:20 So he did it and now we just had the Falcon Heavy launch that executed
01:32:26 fucking like land like upright landings of rockets that will allow the cost of like
01:32:32 Flight of space travel to go down by like 50% which means 50% more launches
01:32:37 Which means we're that much closer to colonizing like the moon actually having civilizations on Mars like actual real
01:32:43 Tangible benefits. That's what fucking matters in this world not this bullshit emotional shitty stuff that I do on YouTube
01:32:50 But how did the dark night rises make you feel?
01:32:54 Shit composition
01:32:58 All that stuff all that stuff is Huey's law
01:33:01 Which is good because it baits people in to actually like listen to your message
01:33:06 But if that message isn't good or isn't there then you've wasted everyone's time I could not shit
01:33:11 I don't think it's true at all. I think a lot. I know we disagree here
01:33:14 I think a lot of the point of aesthetics and of art in general is not just about like inspiring you to do better
01:33:20 But helping you to understand yourself
01:33:22 I think there's a lot of people because of the fact that no one educates us that well on like
01:33:28 Psychology or understanding our place in the world or like what the hell's going on because both our teachers and parents don't really understand that shit
01:33:34 Like we need art in order to show us like what the hell's going on in my mind
01:33:38 Like why do I feel this way? Are there other people who feel this way?
01:33:42 Do other people obviously like Gern Lagan was like a clarifying vision of like something important to me
01:33:47 So okay, and I think when you can package that in this in an aesthetic that like okay
01:33:52 Gern Lagan is the same story that's been told a thousand fucking times. It's a hero's
01:33:55 Narrative but like it's in an aesthetic that resonates with the specific type of person that is the two of us
01:34:01 You know like yeah guys who currently are in like their late 20s
01:34:05 Who were probably in their late teens when the show came out and it had like a massive impact because it's like this is the
01:34:12 Bombastic over-the-top epic thing like style and hyper masculine style that was big in the late 2000s fucking it came out like a year after
01:34:20 300 you know like this is what we wanted was like sloganeering
01:34:24 bare-chested like dudes fucking punching each other and
01:34:29 Yeah, so it was like the perfect fucking snacks what we want. Yeah, yeah
01:34:34 Exactly, so that was okay
01:34:36 Like the perfect delivery of this timeless message that everyone needs to hear in order to grow up
01:34:41 But like for us, this is the aesthetic that mattered the one that resonated with us because we're from that generation, you know
01:34:48 Yeah, okay, okay. I'm totally happy to like
01:34:52 Let's give everyone whatever aesthetic they personally need to become a better person
01:34:57 Whatever the delivery package needs to be for people to understand the message. I am all for
01:35:03 Figuring out what it is and exploring it and I think to your point
01:35:06 You're saying that like I mean we don't exactly we can't like identify this shit
01:35:09 Which is why we need people to go out there and make art so that people will feel that there's lots of stuff
01:35:14 They can resonate with and they can seek it out and enjoy it. Um, yeah, okay. That's a pretty reasonable point
01:35:18 I don't know. Sometimes I feel like art is just a big fucking scam
01:35:22 Sometimes I feel like I actually do anything and it's all just uh, you know
01:35:27 It's all just crap that makes you feel good in the moment and people are just being tricked into thinking it's important
01:35:32 What do you guys think about that? I see a break with you
01:35:34 But like it's it's all a matter of like how do we quantify it like how I can't fucking there's no stat sheet
01:35:41 That tells me like how many people I've inspired like, you know, I don't have the analytics for that, you know
01:35:46 I don't have the net good on the world analytics. It's in some way
01:35:51 Somebody making a living off of art. Mm-hmm is worth it for at least the people who know the artists and our friends with them
01:35:59 Yeah, and then that improves the making of art
01:36:02 I think it's like I mean at the very least I'm stimulating the economy in a way
01:36:06 I wouldn't be if I wasn't doing anything, you know, yeah, that's true only if only if you're putting it back
01:36:12 I
01:36:14 Agree with you so much in the fact that it is just appeal
01:36:16 It is just that you are appealing to people and they like what you have made. There's no inherent
01:36:23 You know responsibility for art to inspire to do any real work real world things
01:36:28 That is not intrinsic to art is that that is well
01:36:32 I would I would never say that artists have to do that
01:36:35 I would never say that but I would think like the most valuable art or perhaps even the only art that is actually valuable
01:36:41 Does do that. I guess would be my point
01:36:44 Well sure, I would you I would just say the where I where I disagree with you Ben is that I don't think it's just in the moment
01:36:50 I think if you make good art people will remember for a long time and as I've said before in the sex part of this
01:36:56 I think uh fleeting highs are the most despicable highs and if it can just last a long time then I think that's more valuable
01:37:02 Here's here's my problem. I think that generally okay art can inspire people
01:37:08 But I feel like in general what it mainly inspires people to do is to make more art
01:37:14 Which if if it's just like a big self self inflicting loop a big like
01:37:18 You know a self perpetuating cycle of art inspiring more art, but the art itself is not really getting us anywhere
01:37:24 I mean you can say that but like literally every scientist talks about how they were inspired by star trek
01:37:30 That's a reasonable point everybody. That's a reasonable point. I think there are some all the art that's out there is inspiring people to become
01:37:37 That's true, but like we gotta throw enough darts at the wall until somebody's thing sticks like that
01:37:41 How many sci-fi franchises existed before star trek like was the one that made everybody fucking want to do that?
01:37:48 Unpopular opinion when I hear like someone like I don't know fucking Neil deGrasse Tyson be like
01:37:54 Yeah, I was I love flash gordon so much as a kid that I went into physics and space and astronomy
01:38:00 I roll my eyes so fucking hard. What why because it's fake shit because that's like fake fictional shit and like
01:38:08 Real science is boring
01:38:11 I don't know. I just I don't quite get the like how can like how like like okay like flash gordon
01:38:16 Maybe make space look really cool, but then you grow up and you'll be just studying real space and it's not like flash gordon
01:38:22 I don't know how that I don't know how that could possibly inspire like a real lifelong interest and fascination enough to sustain like
01:38:28 A real career. I feel like you don't have to maintain the problem. We had the interest in it already
01:38:33 Like maybe they probably would have been inclined to do that
01:38:36 Anyway, and flash gordon just happened to be the thing I like at that moment got them to take notice of it
01:38:42 I don't know if I agree with that. Hold on. I gotta
01:38:45 Okay, sure
01:38:46 Just like I'm thinking about because um my friend ghost lightning got into tennis because he watched prince of tennis
01:38:52 Like that show like watching it marathoning it with his wife made them want to get into tennis
01:38:56 The thing is that once they got into tennis and they started watching real tennis
01:38:59 They quickly realized that that show is like utterly nonsense. Like it's ridiculous
01:39:05 But they ended up loving real tennis and it
01:39:08 What actually happened is they just thought that prince of tennis was dog shit, but they love the sport
01:39:13 Like now they just watch fucking baby steps and like and real actual tennis matches and like have fun with it
01:39:19 So like it's not that flash gordon was a good representation of science
01:39:22 It's that once they started doing science
01:39:24 They realized it was great and there's so many people who have the opposite
01:39:27 Like there's so many people who try to get into something because they liked this show and then they realize it's not like that
01:39:34 Like there was a huge boom and people trying to get into crime scene investigations after csi got popular
01:39:38 But like once you actually start up that course load it is not easy
01:39:42 Dude, did you hear did you see there's like a uh, there's a fucking uh, I think was the canadian government
01:39:47 Like posted a notice saying please stop applying for uh, like uh crime scene investigation degrees
01:39:54 We have too many people like you can't get a job. Please stop like the shows are just too popular
01:39:59 How okay, okay, let's let's take it fucking for granted that like
01:40:04 A show or something can inspire
01:40:07 By the way hippo really has to be given like can be credited as like the reason why someone gets into some
01:40:12 Important practical field like science or engineering. Let's just accept that as true
01:40:16 um
01:40:17 How okay, even if that's happening
01:40:19 How do we know that the number of those cases aren't far outnumbered by people who like maybe would have gone into a real field
01:40:26 But instead spent their life just fucking around on the internet just spent spent their life drawing some art and maybe entertaining some people
01:40:33 That's what I worry about thing. I I think we're being really fucking narrow-minded and what we view as I don't know the word just positive
01:40:43 Be okay. I'm somewhat being a devil's advocate right now by the way being alive is good and enjoying
01:40:49 Breathing and being good. Yeah
01:40:51 No, no incorrect
01:40:55 I
01:40:58 Of culture and
01:41:00 Having a heart and a soul and a dick and a brain
01:41:05 Okay, and enjoying
01:41:08 Living and talking to your fellow humans and feeling emotion and conversing muchy. This is all bullshit. I don't care about at all
01:41:16 No, no, I totally agree like I do think that just like enjoyment itself is like sufficient end in and of itself or a thing to be important
01:41:24 I agree
01:41:25 What literally what is the point of advancing human civilization if human civilization is just boring and nothing
01:41:34 Okay, I'm exaggerating a little bit. There's there's a distinction here
01:41:37 I do actually think there was an inherent good in human life and human like happiness and pleasure
01:41:42 I I I do believe that um, but I would say that there is I here's where I would
01:41:48 When rarely one of the rare times I would use the word objective
01:41:51 I would think it is objectively better if there is more happy like more people and more enjoyment and more happiness
01:41:59 And I like I think the way to get there is to constantly be progressing from lifetime to lifetime, you know generation to generation
01:42:06 To be working towards expanding the circle of how much happiness, you know, uh knowledge and pleasure
01:42:11 There is the world, you know, obviously every life should have not too much pleasure
01:42:14 I I don't understand how you think that that like like the like
01:42:19 Well, here much it's real simple here. Okay. Okay. Go. Okay. It's very simple
01:42:24 If you have one person just living a life
01:42:26 You know, normal level of happiness normal level of sadness
01:42:29 They live their life and they die as opposed to two people
01:42:34 Both have a normal level of happiness generally pretty happy lives. They both live and they both die
01:42:38 Which of those is objectively a better universe like where has more good happened? I have a
01:42:43 I don't agree with more people being happy is better. I'm saying, where do you think the happiness comes from?
01:42:50 Where do you think this happiness is?
01:42:53 It does it does come from the subjective experience of being alive. That is true. That is true
01:42:57 It comes from culture. It comes from being in a society and being in a civilization
01:43:02 Like like the point of progressing civilization is that there is more civilization and culture and humans
01:43:09 But here's what I don't like
01:43:11 I I would not be satisfied with the idea of like we keep the exact same number of human beings that are alive
01:43:16 Right now on the planet earth and we just like stay right here and everyone's like happy
01:43:20 I don't know where this idea. I don't know who you're responding to with this. I don't know
01:43:25 I think what Nate is trying to say is that if all we do is worry about art
01:43:30 Then everyone just becomes an artist. We're not worried about expanding the civilization going out to space and all that
01:43:36 This is not this is not is is sex all good or is sex all bad?
01:43:41 This is not do we only focus on culture or do we only focus on I just don't think there's any disagreement here
01:43:46 And I don't know why you're taking the attitude like we do disagree like what is your issue with what I have said
01:43:52 Not not with what you have said. I I I just thought that we were being like like Ben was talking about how like, you know
01:43:58 Oh, that's all fucking scam like like sure like I don't think we need to be discussing
01:44:03 Whether whether art has any like intrinsic like objective value here. Is that not a fair discussion to have?
01:44:10 But I just think it's it's it's it's narrow-minded. It's it's not
01:44:15 There's no sounds like it sounds like you're just taking a position in that discussion
01:44:19 Which is fine, which is having the discussion. Well, okay. I'm I'm okay sure that this is my opinion then in this discussion
01:44:27 This is what I'm presenting. Okay. Is that I think is I think that art is important and I think that it doesn't have
01:44:33 objective
01:44:35 Value do we want to answer another question? Yeah, let's go to another one
01:44:39 All right, let's do it. Um
01:44:41 Much has been disproved. He has been proved incorrect. So let's move on. I'm ready to move on
01:44:46 This is a question. I I'm gonna choose to interpret a certain way
01:44:49 The guy said the guy's name is lord legend of the galactic heroes sucks space dandy wins
01:44:54 That's okay
01:44:56 His question is what would your real life theme be and I've chosen to interpret this as in your theme like
01:45:03 As if you were a work of art. What is your theme? I think he means musical theme, but okay
01:45:12 Like the motif of your life. Yeah, yeah, what is what is your theme?
01:45:17 How much I can fuck how many sluts I can fuck
01:45:21 Uh, that is a that's a great question
01:45:24 The theme uh, the theme of my life would definitely be utilitarian progress. I know it's boring
01:45:29 I know it's obvious, but that's like what it is. So, you know, fuck you
01:45:31 Mine is some masculinity. I don't know whatever. Did you say did you say toxic masculinity? No, I said some themes
01:45:41 Oh, that's what it is. That's what it is. All right. All right. Hey. Hey is talk is toxic masculinity real
01:45:46 Let's talk. Okay. Toxic masculinity is just the idea that masculinity is inherently like bad. It is inherently
01:45:53 No, no, I don't think that that's not
01:45:55 masculinity is when someone is being toxic in a way that is related to their masculinity. I think
01:46:01 Yeah, uh, uh, I don't know. Well, okay. Let's see what urban dictionary. Let me just read the urban dictionary real quick
01:46:06 Why did we why are we talking about this?
01:46:10 Toxic masculinity a social term that describes narrow rep repressive type of ideas about the male gender role that defines
01:46:18 Masculinity as exaggerated masculine traits like being violent unemotional sexually aggressive and so forth
01:46:25 Also suggests that men who act too emotional maybe aren't violent enough or don't do all these what the fuck is this?
01:46:30 I don't understand this definition. This is terrible. Yeah, this is not helping me
01:46:34 um
01:46:35 Well, the theme of my life would probably be like, um, yeah trying to be understood
01:46:40 Like a desperation for like like a mutual understanding or something like that
01:46:46 Okay, the theme of my life would probably be like, I don't know, um
01:46:53 Freedom independence, I guess, you know living
01:46:57 Just living on my own terms. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds about right
01:47:02 Which is great by the way
01:47:04 I would say
01:47:06 irony
01:47:07 Retrospection
01:47:09 Fun
01:47:12 I feel like you're I mean, you're like the most sincere person I know so how is irony a theme of your life
01:47:18 He's pretty ironic too though. He's like post ironic though. Yeah, that's kind of true
01:47:24 Because the way that I express my my inner emotions is presenting them not as
01:47:31 You know the nuanced or or the most, you know
01:47:34 Gently put things in the world. I progress them to to an insane degree and make them appear foolish
01:47:40 Even though they they are how I feel
01:47:43 I don't know if I call it
01:47:46 I do want to express my sincere thoughts sincerely
01:47:51 By the way, I thought your theme was performance
01:47:54 Performance works too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's also good. I would probably I would probably say irony performance fun
01:48:03 I just want to
01:48:05 Do everything that I do I feel like I left that thread hanging
01:48:08 I just looked up the definition of toxic masculinity on wikipedia, which which is much clear
01:48:11 It's much clear
01:48:12 It's just the concept of toxic toxic masculinity used in psychology to describe a certain traditional male norms of behavior
01:48:19 In the united states and europe that are associated with harm to society and men themselves. So okay much clear
01:48:24 It's just saying some aspects of
01:48:26 Socially conceived masculinity masculinity is just the bad kinds
01:48:30 Yeah, but like who defines bad and good. Well, I mean, yeah, that's the kicker like you like I guess it would be up to the
01:48:35 Individuals like what is and is not toxic
01:48:39 And I I guess I'd say there's a problem in here
01:48:41 I don't know like masculinity is another form of
01:48:44 Identitarianism to like define yourself as like masculine. So I guess that's kind of I don't know
01:48:48 I don't really see a lot of value in doing that either, but whatever. It's just good to run your shit
01:48:53 We only got one more good question left. Okay. I found
01:48:56 Your boy Liam asks
01:48:59 Good remedies for the worst days
01:49:02 With a good question mark at the end. Good pussy, my dude
01:49:06 I like to draw
01:49:09 Drawing is good. Oh, I would literally say exercise
01:49:11 I would literally say exercise and here's why first of all exercise has a actual physiological
01:49:16 Positive stimulus once you're done with it
01:49:18 You just feel good and then also if your day is shit you probably feel like oh no
01:49:23 I fucked up everything everything's going bad to to obtain mastery over something in your life
01:49:28 Like to exercise and feel like I did it like I have control over this. I am good
01:49:32 It just makes you feel like better about your life. I was gonna say I was like for kind of the same reasons
01:49:37 I was gonna say just accomplishing something like yeah
01:49:40 For one you have to have a goal like you have to have something you're working towards
01:49:44 Like making making some progress even a little bit of progress on it like before better something
01:49:49 Will make you feel like your day wasn't completely wasted. That's so true. That is so true
01:49:54 Nate on exercise and in one specific thing that I don't do a lot
01:49:58 But I should do because every time I do it. I absolutely love it. I love jelking. You talk about jelking my dude. Oh, yeah
01:50:11 Okay, oh my god. Oh my god the secret we have we have to do the jelk cast next week, but I'll just
01:50:17 It's just
01:50:20 Dwarf as hard as you can grasp your order of as hard as you can
01:50:24 Yes, and pull pull for the fucking life of your stuff
01:50:27 Okay, it is literally where you you do like little pulls on your dick as an as an exercise to like tear it a little bit
01:50:33 So that it gets bigger. It doesn't actually to make your dick
01:50:38 That's what it is. It's what it is
01:50:41 I gotta say, I mean no it gets results
01:50:48 Oh boy, what was I saying? I'm saying
01:50:54 A good jelk my dude
01:50:56 That I fucking that that happened to me earlier today that has changed my life
01:50:59 I'm just gonna do this every day now. Okay, there's an app like you can get on your phone called brain.fm
01:51:04 And it's some like like weird. I think real science, but it might be pseudoscience
01:51:08 They have tracks of music that that they claim like changes, you know, they put your brain in a mood
01:51:14 So you can have your brain focused you can have your brain go to sleep you can have your brain relax
01:51:18 So put your brain in different moods
01:51:20 So I put on the focus track on brain.fm and I went for a walk
01:51:25 I swear to god, this has enhanced my by perception 10 fold
01:51:30 I was aware of everything that fucking moved. I was inside of the fucking earth and I was feeling every single
01:51:36 Vibration and nuance on the fucking earth's field. I was one with all of god's children
01:51:41 I was walking from just from like my house to my local 7-Eleven
01:51:45 And I had this fucking music on and I was aware of every like change of the light or any like homeless person out of the corner
01:51:51 Of my eye
01:51:51 I I was more alert than I ever been in my entire fucking life. It fucked me up and it was insane
01:51:58 I highly recommend everyone. I also got this awesome energy
01:52:01 And it was the best fucking drink I've ever had in my life pipeline punches. Good. I definitely would like to try doing that
01:52:08 Yeah, dude, we can do it together at rag-con
01:52:11 All of you have great. Those are all great remedies. Mine is simply a change up game
01:52:16 Like just change things change something about what you're doing
01:52:19 It could be any of the things that you guys just said
01:52:22 But like generally if I find myself like going down a dark path in my mind
01:52:28 The best way out is to just do something totally different from what I'm doing like listen to for me
01:52:34 If I don't have access to good pussy like Nate said
01:52:36 Um
01:52:38 Podcasts are like a great out. I would just like if I felt funky or like I was just pissed off at the internet
01:52:44 I would just listen to the dick show and play a video game and it's like I don't have to think
01:52:49 I don't have to be myself
01:52:50 I could just listen to the dick show and just listen to him talking
01:52:53 I don't have to think about my problems and I can just play a video game and be somebody else for a little while
01:52:58 You know and like forget about whatever was going on with me, you know, or I guess put on some better music
01:53:03 That's like more
01:53:05 You know like like much he said with that I don't have that program
01:53:08 But like when I feel bad sometimes I'll just like throw on onamonaguchi and try to get something done because like it'll just give you energy
01:53:15 Accomplishing something is definitely I think the the best like long-term solution
01:53:18 Like that's a that's a good feeling that you'll feel like into the future
01:53:21 But if I just want to know that you're having the worst days that you can't accomplish anything
01:53:25 That's probably probably true. I but the best like just my most pleasurable thing I do in my life
01:53:31 Is to sit back put on a movie I love
01:53:34 I I usually the godfather movies are like my go-to ones for this and I'm playing
01:53:38 Then I'm also playing a video game while I'm like watching slash listening to a movie
01:53:42 I love that I've seen a thousand times. Nate. Are you there to say you just want to play video games every night every day
01:53:48 I just want to play video games
01:53:50 Are you aware of the uh, kasey nice that godfather screen saver thing that he's got?
01:53:54 I am and I love it and I love it. I think it's super cool for the audience who doesn't know
01:53:58 Kasey nice that it's a monitor that just at all times is playing a constant loop of godfather 1 and 2
01:54:04 I've said it before. Oh, not godfather 3. I was actually gonna ask about that
01:54:07 If you felt the same about I actually love godfather 3 almost as much as the other ones and people who share godfather 3 are fucking idiots
01:54:13 um, but uh
01:54:15 Uh, whatever. I don't fuck what I was gonna say, but gibbs back gibb
01:54:19 What do you do when your day ain't going right and you want it to feel good if you want to fix a shitty day
01:54:25 Uh a shitty day
01:54:28 um, I usually just try to
01:54:33 Create something and distract myself with work
01:54:36 But if if work and what I've been trying to make is the the problem
01:54:41 Then I usually curl up into a ball and cry
01:54:45 Does that help?
01:54:47 No, it doesn't
01:54:50 I go through I go through yeah, I go through many crises
01:54:57 I like to rapidly cycle through mental crises. It really helps me, you know work out the case
01:55:02 I I always end up at the point where I was like wait nobody cares about my problems
01:55:06 Maybe I should shut up and then I do and then it's great. If you get bored of one crisis. You can just switch to another
01:55:11 Yeah, that's true when you're feeling down like this. Why don't you talk to your friends?
01:55:15 Why don't you talk to your friends about that? Why don't you just come on?
01:55:18 What is going on over?
01:55:20 Gay
01:55:21 I really want a procrastinator animated of like of when ben said you just switch from one crisis to another of someone like
01:55:27 In an arcade switching between two different time crisis machines because it's all
01:55:33 You know, uh, oh that'd be good when I'm feeling down
01:55:36 It it just feels like I don't like to bother friends with that
01:55:41 Especially since I have done it multiple times before and I will probably do it multiple times in the future
01:55:46 It is it's an important and it always ends in in in the same way that I realized that
01:55:51 Nobody needs to hear this. I just need to move on
01:55:54 It's a real thing that we got to recognize about like the people around us like we our friends will tell us
01:55:59 Oh, you can come to me with anything you can tell me blah blah blah like I'm always here for you
01:56:03 But nobody actually wants to hear about how sad you are over and over again. Nobody wants that
01:56:09 I recognize that and you know if someone comes to me and just is complaining and like if most of my experience of
01:56:15 A certain person is that they're just sad and complaining like I will not enjoy hanging out with them
01:56:20 It'll just be like well, it's like I mean if they're your friend if they're if they're your friend
01:56:25 They'll do it for you. They'll listen to you if you need an ear
01:56:28 But if like but if you're like doing it all the time and you're like really
01:56:32 You know taking up a lot of their time with like some sad shit. Yeah, like why would they continue?
01:56:37 What do they get out of it?
01:56:39 I think well here's the thing with it is like if you're a good friend you'll listen to your friend
01:56:45 And and help them through whatever they're going through
01:56:47 But if that friend the person who is going through things is a good friend
01:56:51 They will realize that they don't they shouldn't
01:56:54 They they need to fix themselves before they just lay it on someone. I mean, it's ultimately. Yes
01:56:59 Ultimately, it is your responsibility to fix your own shit
01:57:02 But like of course like I would if any of you guys came to me like as a one-time thing
01:57:06 Just just as an example and just said like dude. I'm just really sad about this. Of course. I'd be happy to listen
01:57:10 Everybody needs a sympathetic ear from time to time
01:57:13 I got a story to ask because like one of my old friends like he was that guy who would like come and you know
01:57:19 and cry about his life all the time and
01:57:22 Like everybody in my group of friends is like smart and good at giving advice
01:57:26 And this guy's probably the dumbest guy I know out of out of the people who hang out their friends
01:57:30 So like he's constantly whining and people are constantly trying to give him advice
01:57:34 And he just wouldn't fucking follow anybody's advice and he'd come to you crying the next day and you're like, dude
01:57:38 I already told you what to do. That's the thing. Like if you're not gonna do it. Fuck you
01:57:45 I will also say though
01:57:49 I will say that usually
01:57:51 It when it comes to advice like I get advice and it's usually advice that I agree with
01:57:56 Yes, it's not knowing what to do. That's the problem. It's never knowing what to do. It's just doing it
01:58:02 Also on the perspective of advice is kind of masturbatory or like a waste of time
01:58:06 That's definitely give or ask for advice and plus like at least if you know what you're doing
01:58:10 If you if you like I mean anyone who comes to me and like asks for my help about anything
01:58:15 I will like immediately pull out the fucking spreadsheet and attempt to immediately solve the issue
01:58:20 And I don't give a fuck what your excuses are. I will identify the blockages
01:58:24 I will figure out ways to circumvent them like anyone who comes to me with a problem
01:58:28 And I care enough about you. We will solve it then and there
01:58:30 We will identify the ways to do it
01:58:32 But a lot of people don't actually want that a lot of people just want a sympathetic ear
01:58:36 And I am the wrong guy for that. So that's what you're looking for. That's not me. That is not me. So
01:58:42 Yeah, you know just that
01:58:45 You should go to who you want like if you just want somebody
01:58:47 Honestly, like like like women do this more like my girlfriend is definitely like this
01:58:51 She just wants me to like listen to her sad day whenever she tells me about like problems
01:58:55 I'm just like a break it out the spreadsheet. Let's fix it right now identify the problems
01:58:58 It's been identified the solutions, but like sheet. What are you using a spreadsheet to help with in this scenario?
01:59:03 Well, uh spreadsheets are okay making lists is essentially laying out the facts. Okay. Yeah, that's what I mean, but I literally use spreadsheets
01:59:11 Okay, I didn't yeah, I'm literally talking about spreadsheets like spreadsheet guys
01:59:16 My job has awakened me to how spreadsheets are the only thing that matter in this world
01:59:20 They are the only thing that matters at all a human experience is subjective fucking excel spreadsheets are are absolute
01:59:29 Exactly what you're talking about because when I when I'm trying to give advice
01:59:33 There's usually either a list or like a graph of some kind involved. Like yeah
01:59:38 There's a lot of me making graphs with my hands when I'm trying to explain what somebody should do
01:59:43 There's there's not a single gray or rush of doping that that rushes for through my loins
01:59:48 Rather than when I open up a new google doc
01:59:52 That is the height of my fucking day
01:59:54 Also, just just to close this off. I I don't
01:59:58 Disagree with any of what she said I
02:00:01 I feel like like I I I'm down to you know talk whenever I I will just say I
02:00:07 Try and make it a real point to not make it I want to hear about everyone's you know
02:00:12 Sad days, but I want to make it known that I'm not letting them become complacent or just like I don't know
02:00:18 I don't know how to say this correctly, but I don't want to know that like it's a
02:00:22 I'm just kind of like you will listen to them all day, but you would rather they not think that you're not trying to help them
02:00:29 like you know
02:00:31 I just mean that I don't want them to be
02:00:33 Two's I want them to I want them to have a fire into their ass to fix their problem
02:00:39 I don't want them to just think that I like it's not that I you don't want to placate them. You don't want to placate them
02:00:44 It just left the language. Yeah, exactly perfect. It's like I'll listen to you at all times
02:00:49 But you're not allowed to know that like you know
02:00:53 It's I'll listen to everyone all the time, but I want to help them first and foremost
02:00:58 And I don't want to always just be like, oh, I'm sorry pat pat there there
02:01:01 I want to give them advice and I want them to fix what is happening
02:01:05 I don't want to just I don't want to just be the guy you know
02:01:08 I I am my life has come to a certain point where I've only got so much time
02:01:13 And like people who want to come to me with their problems like if I care about you I'll listen but listen buddy
02:01:18 I'm budgeting you 20 minutes of my time to fix your fucking problem or to like listen to you complain about it
02:01:23 That's what you got use it how you want
02:01:26 But then I'm out of here because I got shit to do and I'm not gonna just sit here all day and you know
02:01:30 Listen to your complaints and maybe that makes me a bad person
02:01:32 I call it like being a productive person who who optimizes his usage of his time because I have so little to spare
02:01:39 Uh, it's just you know, that's how my life is now and that's how I'm gonna be
02:01:43 I think I'm the same as you need. I'm just more lenient with the times
02:01:46 I think I think I mean we want we want to get it to be done
02:01:49 Not not to like shit on you or anything
02:01:50 It's just like I probably have like just less time to spare because I've got a full-time job and youtube stuff
02:01:55 So like that's forced me to be very stringent with how I use my time. So, you know, just saying just saying
02:02:02 I think we're over the two-hour mark here. That was good though. Man. I really enjoyed that. Oh, you know what?
02:02:06 Questions
02:02:08 Yeah
