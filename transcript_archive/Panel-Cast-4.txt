00:00:00 Come on, you fuckers think that just cause a guy reads comics he can't start some shit?
00:00:04 Aw, fucking take all you want!
00:00:06 Goodbye, you're heavy.
00:00:08 Home again, home again.
00:00:10 Give me a try to love!
00:00:11 Class is paying 101.
00:00:15 I guess one person can make a difference.
00:00:20 Alright, welcome everybody to the panel cast, I guess.
00:00:23 This is the first panel cast that I've done in a long time.
00:00:27 I don't know why I haven't done one in a long time.
00:00:32 I don't know why I would do one again.
00:00:34 Fuck comics, I don't care about comics.
00:00:36 I damn sure don't care about my listening audience.
00:00:39 I don't care about The Pro Crastinators fans.
00:00:42 I don't care about a dang old thing.
00:00:45 Joining me once again is the boozy floozy.
00:00:48 Hi.
00:00:49 She's here to talk to you.
00:00:51 She knows about comics too, and so do I.
00:00:53 I know the most about comics.
00:00:55 We know the best comics.
00:00:57 We play the best comics, and we're the best at them.
00:00:59 We read the best comics, and we're the best at talking about them.
00:01:02 And this is the panel cast, and this is the comics that were this week.
00:01:07 What are we...
00:01:09 Well, we didn't really read anything.
00:01:11 I haven't read a comic in two years.
00:01:14 I haven't read a comic in nine on to seventeen years!
00:01:19 Ever since your older brother was born and done,
00:01:23 sent our family spiraling into poverty.
00:01:26 You little shit.
00:01:28 Let's talk about the uncanny Avengers.
00:01:31 Number 18.
00:01:33 What do you think about this comic that you didn't read?
00:01:36 It was good.
00:01:37 It was a good comic.
00:01:39 You kind of read it over my shoulder.
00:01:41 Yeah, I did.
00:01:43 I'm gonna be perfectly honest.
00:01:45 I'm out of the loop.
00:01:46 The last thing that I remember hearing anything about Red Skull
00:01:50 and Xavier is that Red Skull apparently ate Professor X's brain or some garbage.
00:01:56 Yeah, that happened about three years ago or some shit.
00:02:01 And it's just been this long dragged out storyline of the Red Skull
00:02:05 has all of Xavier's psychic powers now.
00:02:07 And they're trying to find him and kill him and get him.
00:02:10 It's Rogue, and it's Deadpool, and Cable,
00:02:14 and it's the Quicksilver is on the team,
00:02:17 and the Wasp is on the team.
00:02:19 That's actually a really good team.
00:02:20 Yeah, it's a pretty good book.
00:02:22 And Captain America was in charge of them,
00:02:24 but he got mad at them and he fired them all.
00:02:27 So now Rogue's gone rogue.
00:02:31 That's like a gamer's tavern joke.
00:02:33 Wow.
00:02:34 Yeah, I guess Rogue is gone rogue.
00:02:37 But now they're not officially sanctioned anymore.
00:02:41 They don't have Captain America's blessing anymore.
00:02:43 It's just a team of fucking pissed off people
00:02:46 who don't give a shit.
00:02:47 They just want to kill the Red Skull.
00:02:48 That's their only mission.
00:02:50 Deadpool and...
00:02:51 Which Captain America?
00:02:53 The real Captain America, the only real Captain America,
00:02:55 the white one.
00:02:56 Not Black in America, not that one.
00:02:58 No, not, not, not fucking, not Jonestown, USA.
00:03:06 Not, uh, welcome to Booferville, population one.
00:03:14 Not, not welcome to the jungle.
00:03:16 We got funny games.
00:03:21 Not, uh, not, not, uh, not Jigaboo of the jungle.
00:03:28 Stop.
00:03:29 Watch out for that tree.
00:03:34 With the help of his friend, an ape named Ape.
00:03:37 Okay, so this is a comic about Black people, I guess.
00:03:43 That's what we were talking about, right?
00:03:44 We were talking about how the Blacks came to America.
00:03:49 The Blacks came to America and they ate Professor Xavier's brain with...
00:03:53 Is that the little mermaid I'm hearing?
00:03:55 Interrupting my hilarious anecdote?
00:04:00 Turn that shit off!
00:04:03 What is happening?
00:04:04 My shitty Let's Plays are playing in the background of my shitty podcast
00:04:08 and it's ruining both of them!
00:04:13 As I was saying, this is a comic about how the first Blacks came to America
00:04:18 and ate Charles Xavier's brain at Thanksgiving dinner with the pilgrims
00:04:21 and then slaughtered all the Indians.
00:04:24 You know, those Blacks, they don't know about their Black privilege
00:04:28 that they got from scalping all those Indians.
00:04:31 The Blacks invented scalping.
00:04:35 Scalping tickets.
00:04:37 I'll have to take your word for it.
00:04:39 History was never my strength in school.
00:04:42 Did you major in herstory?
00:04:46 Because you're such a vagethumping feminist?
00:04:53 What?
00:04:56 You know, there's Bible thumpers and then there's vagethumpers.
00:05:00 Is this because of my sandwich comment earlier?
00:05:02 Yeah.
00:05:03 Are you fucking serious?
00:05:07 This guy, I swear...
00:05:09 What the fuck?
00:05:10 The only thing that's gonna be thumping that vag is the strong right hand of D. Trump's America.
00:05:16 Boy, don't I know it.
00:05:18 Doesn't that happen in January?
00:05:20 Oh boy.
00:05:21 Shit.
00:05:22 Donald Trump isn't even funny to me anymore.
00:05:24 I don't care about anything.
00:05:25 Nothing's funny anymore.
00:05:27 I'm a comic book boy.
00:05:28 Welcome.
00:05:29 So in this comic on the cover, it's got a picture.
00:05:32 And inside the comic, there's more pictures.
00:05:34 And some of the pictures have little word balloons.
00:05:36 It starts with a flashback of Rogue.
00:05:39 But it's a dream she's having.
00:05:40 It's a scary nightmare.
00:05:41 And then she goes...
00:05:43 The Red Skull, he's got brain stuff.
00:05:46 He fucks with Quicksilver.
00:05:47 And she goes to beat him up.
00:05:49 She goes, I'm gonna kill him.
00:05:50 And she goes and gets him, but it's all a trick.
00:05:52 And at the end of the comic, she pulls a fast one.
00:05:56 He pulls a fast one on her.
00:05:57 And so now she's hypnotized, too.
00:06:00 And so this storyline, this storyline is just,
00:06:03 it keeps chugging along.
00:06:05 It'll never end.
00:06:06 They'll never kill the Red Skull.
00:06:07 Yeah, that's...
00:06:08 Like why?
00:06:09 Why even try?
00:06:10 Like why even have the storyline?
00:06:12 Why even start a storyline of like,
00:06:14 we're gonna kill one of these big villains
00:06:16 when you know that they're never gonna kill any of the big villains?
00:06:20 Well, nobody thought that they'd kill Wolverine,
00:06:22 but look at that.
00:06:23 I mean, that's kind of why characters like The Punisher
00:06:25 don't really work in comics as much.
00:06:27 I mean, The Punisher works on his own,
00:06:30 but like when you add in like,
00:06:31 like when you start thinking like,
00:06:33 okay, why is the Kingpin still alive?
00:06:36 And Kingpin's getting his own comic.
00:06:39 Yeah, it's just like, you know,
00:06:41 if you're not gonna have the balls to kill off these bad guys,
00:06:45 then I guess fuck everything.
00:06:47 It's all worthless.
00:06:48 Well, I mean, didn't technically he kill Kingpin
00:06:51 and Punisher Max,
00:06:52 but the Punisher Max series is his own entire different universe.
00:06:54 Not even in the canon.
00:06:55 It's a different...
00:06:56 It's a different universe.
00:06:57 Well, anyways, that was Uncanny Avengers,
00:06:59 and it sure was a comic.
00:07:00 What's the next comic?
00:07:01 What, how do I...
00:07:02 What the hell is this?
00:07:04 I don't know.
00:07:05 What is this website?
00:07:06 I don't know what else you read.
00:07:08 I mean, what is this stack of comics
00:07:10 that I purchased legally at a comic book store?
00:07:13 Ooh.
00:07:14 Ooh.
00:07:15 Ooh.
00:07:16 Ooh.
00:07:17 I like, I like some of these comic books.
00:07:21 Which ones?
00:07:22 I like comic books.
00:07:23 I like comic books.
00:07:24 Okay, here's Rocket Raccoon number one.
00:07:26 Yeah.
00:07:27 And he's a little raccoon boy.
00:07:29 Yeah.
00:07:30 Oh, he looks sad.
00:07:31 He's stranded on Earth because the Civil War II,
00:07:35 their spaceship got blown up.
00:07:36 So all the Guardians are having their own solo adventures.
00:07:38 They're all stranded on Earth or some shit.
00:07:40 Yeah.
00:07:41 He's eating a pretzel out of the garbage can.
00:07:43 And he fucking hates Earth.
00:07:45 He doesn't like Earth because he's a raccoon boy.
00:07:48 He's scratching a man.
00:07:49 He's killing him.
00:07:50 Good.
00:07:51 He's pissed off.
00:07:52 And then he goes, oh man, this is a really shitty episode
00:07:55 of the panel cast.
00:07:56 This is a real clusterfuck.
00:07:57 This is a train wreck.
00:07:58 But anyways, that's Rocket Raccoon number one.
00:08:00 And he's, you know, he's, I guess the human torches in this.
00:08:03 Johnny's, oh, I clicked on the wrong thing.
00:08:05 And I, oh boy.
00:08:07 Oh boy.
00:08:08 What is happening here?
00:08:10 But anyways, you know, let's just go to the last page
00:08:12 and see how this story resolves itself.
00:08:14 Dog butt.
00:08:15 Let's see.
00:08:16 What's the, I guess it would be page 22 here.
00:08:19 Let's see what happens, Cyril.
00:08:22 Um.
00:08:23 I don't know what that is.
00:08:25 Yeah.
00:08:26 I don't know what the hell that is.
00:08:27 But you know, so he's got a comic.
00:08:29 So that's, that's something.
00:08:32 I don't even know what, what came out anymore.
00:08:35 Oh, Spider-Man.
00:08:36 The more of this.
00:08:37 Nope.
00:08:38 That's not the Spider-Man I was thinking of.
00:08:40 Black Spider-Man.
00:08:41 Black Spider-Man.
00:08:42 I know.
00:08:43 Miles Morales.
00:08:44 I like Miles.
00:08:45 Niles the Niglet.
00:08:47 Oh my God.
00:08:50 I clicked on it thinking that there was a new Spider-Man,
00:08:53 but it was the wrong Spider-Man.
00:08:54 It was a little black baby.
00:08:56 I thought we didn't care about Spider-Man anymore.
00:08:58 Hey, did you read the new Venom yet?
00:08:59 I thought you were going to say,
00:09:00 I thought we didn't care about race anymore.
00:09:04 I thought, did you read the new Venom?
00:09:07 At all?
00:09:08 The new Venom.
00:09:09 Yeah.
00:09:10 There was an issue, like there are only up to two issues now,
00:09:12 but it was actually really good.
00:09:14 There's a new host for the symbiote now,
00:09:17 and it kind of seems like they're going the ghost wrap-wrap.
00:09:20 How many new hosts does there have to be for?
00:09:22 There's only been like three.
00:09:23 Well, maybe there's been more.
00:09:24 There was Eddie Brock and there was Flash Thompson
00:09:26 and there was probably 10 other guys.
00:09:27 No, there's a Scorpion,
00:09:28 but we don't talk about that.
00:09:29 Oh yeah, Max Gargleballs.
00:09:31 Don't fucking talk about it.
00:09:32 Max Gargleballs.
00:09:33 I like that.
00:09:35 Yeah, I actually really like the new Venom comic.
00:09:41 They are going back to the roots of the symbiote
00:09:45 working for evil again, I guess, basically.
00:09:48 And they're kind of taking a...
00:09:50 For those of you who have been reading the Old New Ghost Rider,
00:09:53 they're kind of taking that route, the symbiote, now.
00:09:56 I don't want to give away too much.
00:09:59 I don't want to spoil too much, but...
00:10:01 I don't know.
00:10:02 There are only up to two issues,
00:10:03 and I've really liked both of them so far.
00:10:04 I can't stop farting.
00:10:07 Oh yeah, this guy.
00:10:11 This guy.
00:10:18 Did you...?
00:10:19 No!
00:10:21 Did it squeak?
00:10:22 No!
00:10:25 I'm shitting my pants!
00:10:31 So there's All Star Batman number five.
00:10:33 I think this is the last one of this arc.
00:10:35 Yeah.
00:10:36 It's by Scott Snyder.
00:10:38 Scott Snyder, who is a wonderful writer,
00:10:41 but goddamn it, I don't fucking like the art.
00:10:44 I don't know.
00:10:45 I don't know if I'd go that far.
00:10:46 He's a good writer?
00:10:47 I...
00:10:48 What don't you like of Scott Snyder's?
00:10:51 All of it.
00:10:52 All of it, really?
00:10:53 I hate the...
00:10:54 Everything he does is just a hackier,
00:10:56 lame-er version of what Grant Morrison did.
00:10:59 The Court of Owls is just a lame-er, black glove.
00:11:02 His Joker is just like a homo, a gay.
00:11:06 He wants to suck Batman's dick like blatantly.
00:11:10 He ruined the fucking Joker.
00:11:12 By making him gay, it is homophobic.
00:11:15 And I don't care.
00:11:17 It's gay!
00:11:22 He writes his little Batman comics,
00:11:24 and he draws a little word balloon.
00:11:26 He draws a Joker.
00:11:27 He says, hey Joker, say something gay.
00:11:29 Then he writes in the little word balloon,
00:11:31 I'm gay!
00:11:33 I just like to imagine that all of Joker's
00:11:37 word bubbles are shaped like wieners.
00:11:39 And they're like, you gotta stop doing that.
00:11:42 Yeah, I hated all of his Joker stories.
00:11:46 You know, I don't really remember the Joker stories very well.
00:11:49 I just remember them being really fucking gross.
00:11:51 Actually, that's a lie, because I liked Endgame.
00:11:53 See, I thought that one was kind of anti-climax.
00:11:56 So of his two Joker stories, I hated one of them.
00:11:59 I liked his Bloom story.
00:12:01 Well, yeah, that was an interesting character.
00:12:03 I liked Bloom.
00:12:04 But I hated the whole Gordon Batman thing.
00:12:06 We're just talking amongst ourselves now with no context
00:12:09 for anyone who didn't know how to even give a shit.
00:12:11 But anyways, this is All Star Batman.
00:12:13 This is his new thing.
00:12:15 And, you know, it was a cool story.
00:12:17 Some shit about Two-Face, you know?
00:12:21 I feel like this comic took a while to come out.
00:12:23 So by the time you get to the end of the story,
00:12:25 you don't remember what the beginning of the story was.
00:12:27 Two-Face put a head out on Batman.
00:12:29 Yeah, basically. There's more to it than that.
00:12:32 But, you know, it's, you know...
00:12:34 Tweedledee and Tweedledum, what the fuck?
00:12:36 But anyways, at the end of the story, you know,
00:12:38 basically, Two-Face has this cure, this little thing.
00:12:43 And it's gonna either make him all Harvey or all Two-Face.
00:12:47 You know, whichever side of his personality is the strongest,
00:12:50 that side is gonna take over.
00:12:52 But at the end of it, Batman says,
00:12:55 fuck you, and he breaks the cure,
00:12:57 because he says that, you know,
00:12:59 everybody in the world has to make the choice every day
00:13:02 which side is stronger.
00:13:04 So I'm not gonna give you the easy way out,
00:13:06 you little punk-ass bitch.
00:13:08 That's fine. No, I don't like that.
00:13:10 You don't like that?
00:13:11 I don't like that.
00:13:12 Well, Batman explains it better than I do.
00:13:14 I explained it bad.
00:13:16 That's fair.
00:13:20 But, um, anyways, you know,
00:13:22 that's Batman for ya.
00:13:24 That was a good story, I think.
00:13:26 I don't remember it with perfect clarity,
00:13:28 but you know, you know, video games,
00:13:30 I mean comics, this is comics.
00:13:33 Oh yeah, The Dark Knight 3, Master Race number seven.
00:13:36 That only took a million years to finally come out.
00:13:39 Yeah, so I didn't actually read this issue.
00:13:41 I skimmed it, but it looks cool.
00:13:43 I've been reading up to this point,
00:13:45 but I've been so I don't really give a shit.
00:13:47 I don't really give a shit.
00:13:50 So I've been reading comics sometimes,
00:13:52 and when I was a little boy,
00:13:54 and I'm a comic.
00:13:56 And so in this comic,
00:13:58 so this is the third in The Dark Knight trilogy
00:14:00 of, you know, the Frank Miller man.
00:14:02 Frank Miller is, you know,
00:14:04 I guess you'd call him one of the seminal
00:14:06 comic book boys
00:14:08 of the 80s.
00:14:10 It was like him and Alan Moore and Grant Morrison.
00:14:12 They all made comics cool.
00:14:14 Some kind of triad, I guess.
00:14:16 Yeah.
00:14:17 Wouldn't Warren Ellis be in there somewhere?
00:14:19 Wouldn't Warren Ellis be in there somewhere?
00:14:21 Wouldn't Warren Ellis and fuckin'
00:14:23 Bill Gaiman and all of them.
00:14:25 All the old boys.
00:14:27 But, um, yeah.
00:14:29 You know, Frank Miller, he was a great writer.
00:14:31 He's one of the best of all time.
00:14:33 You know, a lot of Frank Miller stories
00:14:35 are my favorite stories of all comics, you know?
00:14:37 Yeah, Daredevil born again is fantastic.
00:14:39 His Wolverine,
00:14:41 which he didn't write, he just drew it.
00:14:43 Claremont wrote it, but, you know,
00:14:45 the original Wolverine was great.
00:14:47 And The Dark Knight Returns is still a great story.
00:14:49 It still holds up.
00:14:51 It's a great version with fucking
00:14:53 RoboCop
00:14:55 as Batman, which was the coolest thing
00:14:57 Peter Welling.
00:14:59 And it was amazing.
00:15:01 It was the coolest thing of all time.
00:15:03 But that's a good story.
00:15:05 So everyone really loved him.
00:15:07 He was one of the most famous comic book writers.
00:15:09 He was very critically acclaimed.
00:15:11 His stories are, you know, among the most influential
00:15:13 and widely adapted.
00:15:15 If you've seen Batman v Superman,
00:15:17 you've basically seen,
00:15:19 you know, it's
00:15:21 it's Batman v Superman
00:15:23 is just a bastardized, crappier version
00:15:25 of everything that Frank Miller ever wrote.
00:15:27 Yeah.
00:15:29 But, um,
00:15:31 he sort of stopped being
00:15:33 so critically acclaimed at a certain point
00:15:35 and everyone kind of turned on him.
00:15:37 And they started saying, you know,
00:15:39 he's gone crazy. He's racist.
00:15:41 He hates Islam. He's a misogynist.
00:15:43 He's a misogynist. He's, you know, the whole thing.
00:15:45 So people stopped liking him
00:15:47 and they, you know, his
00:15:49 his stories started getting
00:15:51 worse, I guess.
00:15:53 His art got a lot more stylized.
00:15:55 I don't
00:15:57 really care that much for Miller's art style.
00:15:59 Well, people have always said that his art
00:16:01 has gotten worse
00:16:03 and they're right
00:16:05 looking at it.
00:16:07 I was going to defend him, but then like
00:16:09 I'm looking at it right now and I'm like, yeah.
00:16:11 I've never been like a big fan
00:16:13 of Miller's artwork and I've never really been
00:16:15 of a John Romita Junior's artwork.
00:16:17 At least not any of the more recent
00:16:19 I like John Romita Junior's art style.
00:16:21 I don't like John Romita Junior's more recent art style.
00:16:23 He had a different art style
00:16:25 like when he first started and then it
00:16:27 progressively started changing and now they're all sausage fingers.
00:16:29 Well, that's how you, that's sort of how it is
00:16:31 with Frank Miller's art. Like you can tell that it's still
00:16:33 his style, but like he's just
00:16:35 it's evolved in such a way that like
00:16:37 it's gotten more and more stylized
00:16:39 and cartoony to the point where it's,
00:16:41 you know, the anatomy is very
00:16:43 weird and a lot of people hate it
00:16:45 and I hate it.
00:16:47 But um, yeah, it's not so bad.
00:16:49 But anyways, you know, so
00:16:51 he wrote The Dark Knight Returns a million years ago
00:16:53 in the 80s. It's a story about
00:16:55 old-ass Batman.
00:16:57 He's old and he's retired. He's
00:16:59 bitter. He comes back
00:17:01 to kick more ass for one last hurrah.
00:17:03 Then like, you know,
00:17:05 years later and like the
00:17:07 year 2000 or something, he wrote The Dark Knight
00:17:09 Strikes Again, which was like the second of that
00:17:11 series. And in that series,
00:17:13 everyone hated it. It was
00:17:15 poopy. Um, I have it.
00:17:17 I've never actually read the second one because
00:17:19 everyone's told me it's bad, but I know what happens
00:17:21 in it. It's, it turns out that like
00:17:23 like Dick Grayson
00:17:25 turned into like a spooky
00:17:27 bad guy man and nobody liked it.
00:17:29 But anyways, the point is nobody liked the
00:17:31 second one and nobody likes Frank Miller anymore.
00:17:33 So, but he's come back to do The Dark Knight 3 now
00:17:35 the, the, the third
00:17:37 in his trilogy, I guess, of this
00:17:39 saga that he started way back in the 80s.
00:17:41 Which honestly has sold like exceptionally
00:17:43 well, but I, but
00:17:45 it's had some issues with
00:17:47 you know, being churned out on time.
00:17:49 The last issue
00:17:51 I remember specifically it getting canceled
00:17:53 for resuscitation at a later date
00:17:55 when I was dealing with it
00:17:57 at least twice, I think.
00:17:59 And you know, that always kind of puts
00:18:01 a wrench in things, honestly.
00:18:03 Well, yeah.
00:18:05 The big question going into this
00:18:07 from everyone is that like
00:18:09 does Frank Miller still have it? Can he still
00:18:11 tell a good Batman story? Because
00:18:13 you know, everybody hates him
00:18:15 now. He's, he's not, he doesn't
00:18:17 have the same, his name doesn't carry the same
00:18:19 weight as it once did because
00:18:21 so much of his recent stuff has been so critically
00:18:23 panned like his All-Star Batman and Robin
00:18:25 from a couple years back.
00:18:27 I remember that. Which is basically a meme
00:18:29 because it's so
00:18:31 weirdly aggressive and cynical and
00:18:33 out of character. Like out of
00:18:35 character, even for Batman, it's
00:18:37 like way too cynical. It reads more like
00:18:39 Rorschach as Batman
00:18:41 and it's a really
00:18:43 weird, like hilariously
00:18:45 bad comic. It was so bad
00:18:47 that like
00:18:49 when the first few issues
00:18:51 of All-Star Batman and Robin came out, everybody
00:18:53 hated it so much and said it was so terrible
00:18:55 that like by the
00:18:57 fifth issue, Frank Miller had to go
00:18:59 oh, no, it's
00:19:01 it's a parody, it's campy.
00:19:03 Like he had to like go, he had to back
00:19:05 pedal and play that card. So then like from
00:19:07 issue five on, he tries to
00:19:09 make it even more extreme to make it seem
00:19:11 like he was trying to make a parody of Batman
00:19:13 from the get go, but he's not fooling anyone
00:19:15 so it just gets weirder and dumber and weirder
00:19:17 and crappier.
00:19:19 But it was not meant to be a parody.
00:19:21 That's bullshit.
00:19:23 He screwed the pooch on that one big
00:19:25 time and everyone hated it
00:19:27 and nobody likes him anymore
00:19:29 as a writer. But
00:19:31 he's gone back to the
00:19:33 storyline that made him famous in the first
00:19:35 place and
00:19:37 I've really liked this so far
00:19:39 The Dark Knight 3. Have you been reading it?
00:19:41 Yeah, and
00:19:43 my customers have really enjoyed it too.
00:19:45 I have some really avid
00:19:47 fans of this particular comic
00:19:49 primarily because they really enjoyed like the first Dark Knight.
00:19:51 But much like you said
00:19:53 earlier, a lot of people didn't seem to enjoy
00:19:55 the second one very much.
00:19:57 I think everyone's just kind of patiently waiting
00:19:59 to see how this one concludes.
00:20:01 I've yet to have anybody actually like go out of the way
00:20:03 to cancel it or anything.
00:20:05 Nobody has actually said anything like
00:20:07 you know, oh well I don't like where this is going, just take it off my sub.
00:20:09 So
00:20:11 I...
00:20:13 Was it only supposed to be a seven part series? I can't remember.
00:20:15 Is it eight parts?
00:20:17 Seven's a weird number to me. This one definitely ends
00:20:19 on a there's gonna be at least one more
00:20:21 part. Okay, so it's an eight part series.
00:20:23 Okay.
00:20:25 Yeah, no
00:20:27 I think it's good but
00:20:29 you're also talking to somebody who
00:20:31 doesn't really, I'm not
00:20:33 really that big of a Frank Miller fan.
00:20:35 Really? I, you know, a lot of people are
00:20:37 always like the Dark Knight is one of the best stories of all time
00:20:39 but you know, anytime I go back and I talk to people
00:20:41 about my favorite Batman stories
00:20:43 the Dark Knight's never there.
00:20:45 I don't know
00:20:47 if I'd call it like one of my favorite
00:20:49 Batman stories of all time
00:20:51 but I mean everything in it
00:20:53 is clearly important
00:20:55 to like the pop culture
00:20:57 mythos of the characters. And you're right
00:20:59 about that. There's a lot of people that really like
00:21:01 the Robin that's in that particular Dark Knight
00:21:03 even though I don't like
00:21:05 Carrie that much. I have
00:21:07 conflicted feelings about her. It seems like she was never really
00:21:09 trained at all at any point.
00:21:11 She was, even in the movie, she just kind of
00:21:13 puts on the outfit. Like she just shows up and she's Robin.
00:21:15 Yeah, and like even in the
00:21:17 movie at the end when she's like running up next
00:21:19 to Batman's tank, she's just like, she's there for
00:21:21 moral support but she's wearing the costume. I don't
00:21:23 know.
00:21:25 But I did, I have an appreciation
00:21:27 for the whole like Batman vs Superman
00:21:29 thing in the Dark Knight. I thought that was
00:21:31 really good. Yeah.
00:21:33 But it's like you said
00:21:35 BVS basically bastardized that.
00:21:37 Yeah.
00:21:39 The great thing about the Dark Knight 3
00:21:41 is that it really seems like it's
00:21:43 coming from like a place of catharsis
00:21:45 from Frank Miller. Like it seems like it's
00:21:47 a little bit more optimistic
00:21:49 in tone than some of his other
00:21:51 stuff because he garnered such a
00:21:53 reputation for cynicism
00:21:55 and like a lot of his philosophies
00:21:57 about Batman and superheroes in general, I
00:21:59 disagree with too because he always
00:22:01 talks trash about
00:22:03 Batman shouldn't have a Robin
00:22:05 that's gay and that's kid stuff and Batman
00:22:07 and when superheroes
00:22:09 Superman shouldn't
00:22:11 be dating Lois Lane. He should be dating Wonder Woman
00:22:13 because they're both strong and they can have sex
00:22:15 through a mountain.
00:22:17 And there's even like an entire series
00:22:19 about Superman and Wonder Woman being together
00:22:21 and breaking up.
00:22:23 If you really want to get into
00:22:25 the philosophy or the mind of
00:22:27 Frank Miller and how he feels about superheroes
00:22:29 and things like that, I feel like Sin City is
00:22:31 probably one of those books that you need to read
00:22:33 even though I didn't care that much for Sin City.
00:22:35 I've always
00:22:37 gravitated more towards
00:22:39 like a Grant Morrison
00:22:41 sort of philosophy. Like the stuff that he says
00:22:43 in interviews and stuff. When you understand him.
00:22:45 I always feel like yeah, this guy really gets it.
00:22:47 Like
00:22:49 because like
00:22:51 because Grant Morrison's whole thing is that
00:22:53 he has zero cynicism about superheroes whatsoever.
00:22:55 Like he goes into every book like
00:22:57 well yeah, of course Batman
00:22:59 would have a Robin. Of course he would have a best friend
00:23:01 who's 12 years old. Why wouldn't you
00:23:03 if you were a billionaire and they've got a billion dollars? Why wouldn't you fight
00:23:05 crime with a little boy?
00:23:07 He's your best friend.
00:23:09 Like he's always talks like he loves everything about
00:23:11 superheroes and like he goes into every
00:23:13 comic like wanting to talk about like
00:23:15 he wants to incorporate like the entire
00:23:17 mythos and like the whole continuity
00:23:19 of like 70 years of Batman into it.
00:23:21 Grant Morrison's my favorite. He's a good old
00:23:23 puppy dog boy is what he is.
00:23:25 Did Grant Morrison do the black mirror?
00:23:27 I don't know. I don't remember.
00:23:29 I just remember the black mirror being like one of my favorite titles.
00:23:31 Um, but yeah
00:23:33 going on. Yeah, Grant Morrison's great.
00:23:35 Yeah, but and so I guess
00:23:37 they're sort of opposites because Frank Miller has always been
00:23:39 more cynical it seems like. But in this
00:23:41 in The Dark Knight 3 he seems like he's
00:23:43 he's writing it from a place of like
00:23:45 wanting to be more optimistic again because
00:23:47 the whole story of this one is that
00:23:49 um, you know
00:23:51 Batman and Superman are working together again
00:23:53 and they're really kicking ass and
00:23:55 and coming together and saving the day there's
00:23:57 there's this like religious sect of
00:23:59 assholes inside the bottled city of
00:24:01 Kandor who breaks out who they're all
00:24:03 Kryptonian so they're all strong and Superman
00:24:05 so they break out and start raking havoc and trying
00:24:07 to destroy the world and Batman says
00:24:09 you know I'm a hundred and seven thousand
00:24:11 years old but I ain't gonna stand for this
00:24:13 he walks his rickety ass up a mountain
00:24:15 and he he he goes to like the fortress
00:24:17 of solitude and he and he thaws
00:24:19 Superman out of his block of ice because
00:24:21 Superman he's just been hanging out in a block
00:24:23 of ice like he doesn't give a shit anymore
00:24:25 and he goes to the block of ice says hey hey Kent
00:24:27 get your ass out of that ice
00:24:29 we gotta beat people up and Superman
00:24:31 he hears them and he's like what we gotta beat
00:24:33 people up yeah
00:24:35 and then Superman and they just they just
00:24:37 beat people up and there's this great scene
00:24:39 where like you know they're fighting
00:24:41 all these Kryptonians so Batman he
00:24:43 arranges to have it like he does some
00:24:45 shit and it's like raining Kryptonite
00:24:47 rain and it's weakening all the Kryptonians
00:24:49 but then they're still beating them up
00:24:51 because there's so many of them or whatever but then
00:24:53 Superman shows up and he's so
00:24:55 so like the the Batman armor
00:24:57 from like the first book
00:24:59 where Batman wore that like super powerful
00:25:01 armor to fight Superman it's in Batman
00:25:03 v Superman the movie the same armor yeah
00:25:05 they he did he does like a call back to this
00:25:07 where because it's raining Kryptonite
00:25:09 Superman gets in like
00:25:11 his own Batman armor to help
00:25:13 beat up the Kryptonians
00:25:15 and just punching them with his fists
00:25:17 and stuff it's super cool it's the best
00:25:19 it's my favorite comic everyone
00:25:21 I think this is a good one
00:25:23 yeah and then the
00:25:25 and then the the latest issue there's
00:25:27 this great scene this shit yeah
00:25:29 yeah we're looking at the scene right now
00:25:31 I'm sure Jesse will put it up on the
00:25:33 spoilers I guess but yeah
00:25:35 yeah but it's
00:25:37 it's just this great moment that
00:25:39 Bruce and Kent both share together
00:25:41 towards the end of the other latest issue
00:25:45 but yeah um
00:25:47 I will say one thing about Frank Miller's artwork
00:25:49 like I know I already said that I don't really like
00:25:51 it I'm really
00:25:53 emphasizing that with the way that he draws Wonder Woman
00:25:55 oh god
00:25:57 it she's
00:25:59 there's that vagethumping feminist coming out of
00:26:01 you again no it's not feminist
00:26:03 I actually agree
00:26:05 I don't like
00:26:07 I'm gonna get reamed for it
00:26:09 I just fucking know it but
00:26:11 she's just so aesthetically unappealing
00:26:13 to me drawn this way
00:26:15 yeah he's she's really weird looking in this
00:26:17 in his style
00:26:19 he kind of draws her like
00:26:21 like a spooky person
00:26:23 yeah I mean she's got that like spooky
00:26:25 bulky yeah
00:26:27 like fucking
00:26:29 she looks like she's like
00:26:31 she looks like she needs to be wearing pants
00:26:33 she's like a fat soccer mom on steroids
00:26:35 in a bikini that's like 10 sizes
00:26:37 too small for her
00:26:39 she's like the soccer mom from the earlier seasons
00:26:41 a family guy remember
00:26:43 he punches
00:26:45 this guy that he assumes is a man
00:26:47 and then everybody starts screaming
00:26:49 he's like oh my wife
00:26:51 and then he's like what you mean
00:26:53 your husband and then you start hearing
00:26:55 like crying he's like yeah
00:26:57 she wanted to labor she had a baby
00:26:59 that's kind of what
00:27:01 that's kind of what it reminds me
00:27:03 of the way that she's drawn
00:27:05 it's just it's really not
00:27:07 it's not good looking I'm sorry
00:27:09 it's shallow but I don't care
00:27:11 I don't like it hey man there's nothing worse
00:27:13 than a woman who ain't pretty
00:27:15 yeah I go
00:27:17 that's your best quality you know
00:27:19 that your hashtag not fat oh my god
00:27:23 Civil War 2 came out
00:27:25 the last one of that finally that's over
00:27:27 okay so once again
00:27:29 with Civil War
00:27:31 they announced that this was only going to be like a 7 part
00:27:33 series
00:27:35 and before this they did the same thing with Secret Wars
00:27:37 but then all of a sudden they were like
00:27:39 we liked this so much
00:27:41 that we're gonna tag on an extra
00:27:43 issue that's gonna take forever
00:27:45 to fucking release
00:27:47 and you know Civil War 2
00:27:49 when it first released like it
00:27:51 I was into it
00:27:53 I may not have been as into it as I was
00:27:55 in the original Civil War
00:27:57 in fact I feel like the only reason why they even came out with Civil War 2
00:27:59 is because of the fucking movie
00:28:01 but
00:28:03 but it's taken so long
00:28:05 for them to actually conclude
00:28:07 this fucking storyline that I just
00:28:09 I've stopped caring
00:28:11 I really have
00:28:13 you know especially since like previous already
00:28:15 came out with stuff saying you know
00:28:17 here's our next storyline here's
00:28:19 Monsters Unleashed about to happen
00:28:21 it's gotten to the point where the events
00:28:23 are so bloated and so long
00:28:25 that the next ones are already coming out
00:28:27 by the time they're even over it
00:28:29 yeah they did that with Infamous Iron Man
00:28:31 like I remember a ton of people going
00:28:33 wow spoilers much
00:28:35 for Civil War when Infamous Iron Man 1 came out
00:28:37 like Avengers
00:28:39 or X-Men vs. Inhumans is already coming out
00:28:41 and this one has been
00:28:43 so that's the next event and it's already done
00:28:45 it's already done
00:28:47 I think IVX is already done
00:28:49 well
00:28:51 I've already ranted about Civil War 2
00:28:53 so I think AVX only had like
00:28:55 issue number one is out
00:28:57 no IVX
00:28:59 IVX definitely has two issues
00:29:01 same thing it's the same shit
00:29:03 you're kind of right
00:29:05 wait no no no I'm thinking of
00:29:07 no it's not IVX
00:29:09 I'm thinking of there was another one before
00:29:11 where it's all about it's like a four part series
00:29:13 it was all about like
00:29:15 I guess the X-Men getting wiped out or something
00:29:17 I already forgot
00:29:19 I don't know what I'm talking about
00:29:21 is that Harley Quinn I see
00:29:23 yeah I guess this came out too
00:29:25 Harley Quinn's Little Black Book
00:29:27 issue number five didn't the first issue come out last year
00:29:29 Harley Quinn has like 10 different series
00:29:31 I don't even know what I'm looking at here
00:29:33 but the cover is clearly
00:29:35 it's a nod to the old Muhammad Ali vs. Superman cover
00:29:37 Ben she's in a skimpy little thing
00:29:39 hey look it's Obama
00:29:41 I hear Obama you're not
00:29:43 you're not relevant anymore you're just another black nigger
00:29:45 Obama
00:29:47 welcome to
00:29:49 panel cast the most racist podcast
00:29:51 on the internet it's supposed to be a
00:29:53 family friendly comic book show
00:29:55 and it's just an excuse for me to say the N word
00:29:57 50 times every week
00:29:59 Obama
00:30:01 so I didn't read this comic
00:30:03 I don't think I need to read it to know that it's
00:30:05 garbage oh yeah we have
00:30:07 we both have
00:30:09 an issue with current quality
00:30:11 Harley Quinn comic books
00:30:13 I have a lot that I could say about how much
00:30:15 she's designed alone this is like wait
00:30:17 what is that
00:30:19 wait a minute
00:30:21 I don't even think this is a recent comic
00:30:23 I think someone just uploaded this
00:30:25 because this is
00:30:27 maybe no it says February yeah
00:30:29 February 2016 well that's number one
00:30:31 yeah maybe it is a recent comic
00:30:33 no number one was I mean she's
00:30:35 because in this she still looks like she has her
00:30:37 this is still her new 52 design
00:30:39 but they've since redesigned her again and she looks
00:30:41 a little bit better now but still shit
00:30:43 she's a pre-designer to make her look more like the
00:30:45 Suicide Squad version from the movies which
00:30:47 but she still has the
00:30:49 crappy bleached skin
00:30:51 look at the wall eyed
00:30:53 who hired this artist
00:30:55 I don't like it
00:30:57 I don't like it
00:30:59 the black and red thing is terrible too
00:31:01 I mean the hair
00:31:03 okay so
00:31:05 again this is
00:31:07 another thing that I'm probably gonna get reamed for
00:31:09 because everybody loves Harley Quinn
00:31:11 is like one of the most subscribed comic books
00:31:13 that I know of that DC has released
00:31:15 it is the Deadpool of the DC
00:31:17 universe everybody wants
00:31:19 every single Harley Quinn fucking anything
00:31:21 when it comes out Harley Quinn
00:31:23 and Poison Ivy Harley Quinn and Power
00:31:25 Girl Harley Quinn
00:31:27 her little black fucking book
00:31:29 god what else Harley Quinn's little gang
00:31:31 or whatever you know there's so much
00:31:33 fucking Harley Quinn the gang of Harleys
00:31:35 actually I don't think there was a Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy
00:31:37 the gang of Harleys which is basically Deadpool
00:31:39 and the Mercs for money
00:31:41 yeah again this Harley Quinn is
00:31:43 DC's answer to Deadpool
00:31:45 for Marvel like I just
00:31:47 which is
00:31:49 she shouldn't be because that's not
00:31:51 what the character is
00:31:53 okay so Bruce Tim was the one who created
00:31:55 Paul Dini created her
00:31:57 but Bruce Tim was the one who designed
00:31:59 her character I think
00:32:01 or at least he drew her
00:32:03 I think he finalized the design
00:32:05 if I remember right I think Paul Dini
00:32:07 Paul Dini to this day is still
00:32:09 the only person who
00:32:11 writes her correctly
00:32:13 like the only time I enjoy
00:32:15 every time I read a Harley Quinn comic
00:32:17 if I enjoy it without
00:32:19 fail I'll go I know who wrote this
00:32:21 Paul Dini and I'll look at it and then sure enough
00:32:23 because he's the only one who gets her because he created her
00:32:25 I think for the past two years
00:32:27 the person who's been writing for her
00:32:29 um it's been a mannequin
00:32:31 or somebody else and you know I get
00:32:33 that a lot that look you just gave me
00:32:35 I get that look a lot when I say that
00:32:37 you know oh well Amanda Connor is going to be
00:32:39 writing this comic
00:32:41 and you always see the same look from everybody
00:32:43 they're just like oh
00:32:45 she's writing for something
00:32:47 not drawing it
00:32:49 well that wasn't why I gave that look I gave that look because of course it would be a woman
00:32:51 ruining Harley Quinn
00:32:53 well fair enough
00:32:55 of course it would be some wannabe
00:32:57 empowered fucking Tumblrina
00:32:59 who
00:33:01 God
00:33:03 they don't want to acknowledge
00:33:05 what makes the character special because they think
00:33:07 it's like derogatory now
00:33:09 DC
00:33:11 either they don't want to acknowledge it
00:33:13 or they just don't get it DC doesn't
00:33:15 understand why people
00:33:17 love Harley Quinn they don't understand
00:33:19 why this character who
00:33:21 was created 20 years ago
00:33:23 is as popular and as important
00:33:25 to the cultural zeitgeist as
00:33:27 Spider-Man and Superman and Batman who were all created
00:33:29 70 years ago they don't want to
00:33:31 acknowledge the reason why so many
00:33:33 women relate to this character
00:33:35 why so many men can relate to her
00:33:37 why there's so much cosplay of her
00:33:39 why everyone loves this character
00:33:41 so much it's not because she's a
00:33:43 wacky zany deadpool knockoff
00:33:45 it's not because she's an amoral killer
00:33:47 who goes around and commits crimes
00:33:49 and stuff it's not because she's a free spirit
00:33:51 or an empowered you know take no
00:33:53 shit does whatever she wants
00:33:55 badass suicide girl
00:33:57 people love Harley Quinn because she's
00:33:59 a sad damaged human
00:34:01 character she's relatable
00:34:03 the whole the entire basis of the character
00:34:05 is that she fell in love with
00:34:07 the wrong person and she knows it
00:34:09 but it's ruined her fucking life
00:34:11 and everyone's been there that's
00:34:13 why the character became so popular
00:34:15 in the first place she's not insane
00:34:17 she's she's not a wacky
00:34:19 crazy person like the Joker the only reason
00:34:21 that she's acts like that is because she's dating
00:34:23 the Joker she has moments
00:34:25 anything from the old animated series
00:34:27 that you watch anything that Paul Dini has ever written
00:34:29 you can see she'll always
00:34:31 the thing that humanizes the character is these
00:34:33 little moments where like the Joker kicks
00:34:35 her out on her ass and she sits there in like an alley
00:34:37 and she goes how did how did it get
00:34:39 to this how did my life become
00:34:41 this you know she she
00:34:43 she's intelligent enough
00:34:45 to understand how weak she is
00:34:47 and how flawed she is and how fucked up
00:34:49 how badly she screwed up her own life
00:34:51 she's smart enough to realize it but she's
00:34:53 not quite strong enough
00:34:55 to change things and that's what people
00:34:57 relate to because everyone in the world
00:34:59 is this you know everyone relates
00:35:01 to spider-man because everyone has guilt
00:35:03 everyone relates to Superman
00:35:05 because everyone feels like they don't belong
00:35:07 sometimes everyone fucking
00:35:09 relates to Batman because everyone
00:35:11 their parents got shot
00:35:13 watching Zorro that happened to everyone
00:35:15 in the world all of these characters
00:35:17 everyone relates to Bruce Banner because
00:35:19 everyone has a side of themselves they don't like
00:35:21 everyone loses their temper or like
00:35:23 you know everyone can see these flaws in themselves
00:35:25 and that's what people love about Harley Quinn
00:35:27 she's a flawed fucking person
00:35:29 she doesn't have to be
00:35:31 an empowered
00:35:33 wacky Deadpool knockoff going on
00:35:35 these crazy mercenary adventures every week
00:35:37 she just has to be a person
00:35:39 trying to be better than she is
00:35:41 and I don't really touch upon that anymore
00:35:43 like any of the Suicide Squad
00:35:45 comics even the movie
00:35:47 it's just Mr. J
00:35:49 and I'm crazy
00:35:51 and he he I'm cute
00:35:53 but I'm kind of ballistic
00:35:55 am I gonna kiss you?
00:35:57 am I gonna cut you? you never know
00:35:59 it's just terrible
00:36:01 it's accurate and it's terrible
00:36:03 like it and you know
00:36:05 it's so devastating to me because I really
00:36:07 I really enjoyed the character back then
00:36:09 and you know if everyone does
00:36:11 she's a great character
00:36:13 she's a character that didn't exist
00:36:15 before in comics like that specific
00:36:17 moral struggle
00:36:19 yeah I know like that specific
00:36:21 moral struggle that defines her
00:36:23 of just being in love
00:36:25 with the wrong person
00:36:27 everyone ever has been there
00:36:29 everyone has felt that pain and everyone has gone
00:36:31 fucking insane from it
00:36:33 her whole origin
00:36:35 is just that love can make you crazy
00:36:37 not that she's crazy and so she fell in love
00:36:39 that's the misunderstanding
00:36:41 that I think is the basis of all these
00:36:43 crappy new comics
00:36:45 it's just
00:36:47 incredibly frustrating that none of these writers seem to get her
00:36:49 or that they don't want to acknowledge
00:36:51 I think they don't want to acknowledge it
00:36:53 because people have it in their heads now
00:36:55 that it's like somehow derogatory
00:36:57 to women
00:36:59 to acknowledge the fact
00:37:01 that the basis of this character is that
00:37:03 she's weak
00:37:05 but it's not derogatory to constantly throw her
00:37:07 into that situation time and time again
00:37:09 she's weak and she's in love
00:37:11 she's a hopeless romantic
00:37:13 and she's
00:37:15 and she's abused
00:37:17 and no one wants to
00:37:19 it seems like they're trying to move away from that
00:37:21 because
00:37:23 it's not a good role model anymore
00:37:25 well
00:37:27 as if her being like an insane psychopath
00:37:29 serial killer is any better of a role model
00:37:31 right and you know actually
00:37:33 it's a funny line that people
00:37:35 ride upon when it comes to Harley Quinn
00:37:37 so if you haven't seen the new
00:37:39 Suicide Squad movie or any of the
00:37:41 interviews with Margo
00:37:43 Robbie whatever
00:37:45 you know she explicitly says that
00:37:47 that she really wished they had touched upon
00:37:49 the whole
00:37:51 the actual abuse because so far it's only been
00:37:53 glorified
00:37:55 that movie Suicide Squad
00:37:57 was weirdly romantic
00:37:59 like
00:38:01 they seem to really love each other
00:38:03 in that movie
00:38:05 he loved her a lot
00:38:07 he was obsessed with getting back to her the whole movie
00:38:09 which isn't really that much like the Joker
00:38:11 I guess
00:38:13 I haven't seen the Suicide Squad movie
00:38:15 if you didn't know
00:38:17 well the whole Suicide Squad movie is that
00:38:19 the Joker is so
00:38:21 in love with Harley Quinn
00:38:23 that he's on a rampage trying to get back to her
00:38:25 and he's like
00:38:27 there's this scene where
00:38:29 he is so broken up
00:38:31 about Harley
00:38:33 not being there that he goes in this room
00:38:35 with all these knives and he lays on the floor and cries
00:38:37 like a fucking like a 14 year old emo kid
00:38:39 he's crying over not having
00:38:41 his boo with him
00:38:43 the whole Suicide Squad movie
00:38:45 is about the Joker
00:38:47 he just wants his girlfriend back because he's
00:38:49 really in love with her
00:38:51 that's not very characteristic
00:38:53 of him
00:38:55 this is coming from the character
00:38:57 who has actively
00:38:59 gone against Harley Quinn because
00:39:01 she went out of her way to try and do something
00:39:03 to appeal to him
00:39:05 to please him such as kidnapping Batman
00:39:07 and trying to
00:39:09 you know kill him in a way that would be funny
00:39:11 to both her and the Joker
00:39:13 but you know he
00:39:15 fucking gets angry at her for it
00:39:17 he's like you know how dare you do this
00:39:19 and throws it out a fucking window for it
00:39:21 this is coming from that relationship
00:39:23 this is coming from the relationship where he's like time and time again
00:39:25 like trying to kill her over and over
00:39:27 what the fuck
00:39:29 are you serious at Suicide Squad
00:39:31 I'm not
00:39:33 as against the
00:39:35 Jared Leto Joker as everyone else is
00:39:37 I know it looks fucking retarded
00:39:39 but to me
00:39:41 I think a big aspect of the character
00:39:43 the Joker specifically
00:39:45 what makes the Joker such a good character
00:39:47 is that he is inherently
00:39:49 open to interpretation
00:39:51 like I don't think there can really be a wrong Joker
00:39:55 that Young Justice episode was pretty bad
00:39:57 Young Justice
00:39:59 episode is it the
00:40:01 oddly young looking Joker
00:40:03 he looked like David Tennant
00:40:05 yeah oh god he did
00:40:07 don't do this to me
00:40:09 so there can be a wrong Joker
00:40:11 nevermind forget what I just said
00:40:13 anyway
00:40:15 so rewinding back to the whole
00:40:17 abusive situation that Harley Quinn has been in
00:40:19 so there's been tons and tons and tons of stuff
00:40:21 that's touched upon that have you ever read Gotham City Sirens
00:40:23 that was another
00:40:25 mini series
00:40:27 I say mini series kind of loosely because it was like two volumes long
00:40:29 but that was
00:40:31 two volumes long I guess now
00:40:33 nevermind
00:40:35 anyway
00:40:37 wasn't that ongoing of a series
00:40:39 but they touched upon Harley Quinn trying to
00:40:41 overcome what she dealt with the trauma
00:40:43 of being in a relationship with Joker
00:40:45 and Poison Ivy and Catwoman both trying to
00:40:47 support her through it
00:40:49 and injustice even though that's not in the same universe
00:40:51 they touch upon that a lot
00:40:53 in fact I remember there was a scene
00:40:55 specific to Harley Quinn
00:40:57 god he's like one of my favorite characters
00:40:59 starts with an L
00:41:01 he comes from outer space he kicked the shit out of Superman
00:41:03 Lobo, thank you
00:41:05 god I don't know why that left my brain for a second
00:41:07 he's one of my favorite characters
00:41:09 the original not
00:41:11 the new 52 redesign
00:41:13 I don't want to talk about that
00:41:15 but there's a scene
00:41:17 an injustice where Lobo like backhands Harley Quinn
00:41:19 if I remember right
00:41:21 and you know she like spits for a second
00:41:23 and like looks at him and says you know
00:41:25 if there's anything that she's learned
00:41:27 and like her long line of being Harley Quinn
00:41:29 is that she's never gonna take shit from anybody
00:41:31 ever again and of course she's specifically
00:41:33 talking about Joker
00:41:34 I actually really like the injustice comics
00:41:36 I think that's
00:41:37 I swing between liking it and hating it honestly
00:41:39 to me the injustice comics for being like
00:41:41 an else worlds
00:41:43 the characters in that still seem like more
00:41:45 in character than in most mainline DC
00:41:47 publications
00:41:49 they've definitely gone some dark routes with that one
00:41:51 but yeah Harley Quinn
00:41:53 specifically says you know she's been abused long enough
00:41:55 she's never gonna accept this again
00:41:57 and I guess she ends up throwing Lobo out the window
00:41:59 or something something absurd for like
00:42:01 Harley Quinn level strength considering Lobo
00:42:03 is who he is well Harley Quinn
00:42:05 is super strong or she was
00:42:07 before the new 52 I don't know if they changed it
00:42:09 well Harley Quinn but there was a long time where like
00:42:11 Poison Ivy had given her a serum
00:42:13 that gave her like Captain America
00:42:15 ooh I remember that
00:42:17 oh god you know
00:42:19 I think they only remember that when it's
00:42:21 convenient to the plot but that was a thing
00:42:23 you're not wrong probably
00:42:25 but um
00:42:27 yeah the thing about
00:42:29 like to me the core of the character of Harley Quinn
00:42:31 and
00:42:33 remember I'm right
00:42:35 so objectively the core of the character
00:42:37 is
00:42:39 just that
00:42:41 she's a good person who surrounds herself with bad people
00:42:43 bad influences toxic influences
00:42:45 if not for
00:42:47 you know she could be
00:42:49 she could be a force for good in the world
00:42:51 if not for the fact that
00:42:53 her boyfriend is a bad guy
00:42:55 her best friend is a bad guy Poison Ivy
00:42:57 her boyfriend
00:42:59 the Joker is you know a mass murdering
00:43:01 psychotic terrorist
00:43:03 her best friend Poison Ivy is
00:43:05 a man-hating eco-terrorist
00:43:07 you know
00:43:09 even Catwoman is a fucking burglar
00:43:11 and not that there's anything wrong with burglaring
00:43:13 well she's what they would call it
00:43:15 anti-hero I guess
00:43:17 but um that's like the core of the character
00:43:19 like everybody has someone like that in their lives
00:43:21 everybody knows someone who you know
00:43:23 is better than the people they surround themselves with
00:43:25 who has bad influences
00:43:27 and does dumb shit and gets
00:43:29 becomes a burden on everyone they love
00:43:31 you know she's just
00:43:33 so much about the way
00:43:35 the character was originally written and originally conceived
00:43:37 is so human and so relatable
00:43:39 and that's why she took off
00:43:41 she just like skyrocketed immediately
00:43:43 she's only existed for 20 years
00:43:45 and she's like one of the pillars of comic book media
00:43:47 and that's why
00:43:49 one of my favorite episodes
00:43:51 revolving around Harley Quinn
00:43:53 was like the one I think where
00:43:55 where it's just Batman and Harley
00:43:57 like I don't know if you remember that from the animated series
00:43:59 but I really liked that episode
00:44:01 the one where she kisses him at the end is
00:44:03 you're not a bad guy B-man
00:44:09 there's so much that
00:44:11 I think that episode is actually in the opening
00:44:13 of the panel cast it's when
00:44:15 home again home again
00:44:17 yeah no
00:44:19 yeah
00:44:21 Harley Quinn is just it's
00:44:23 it's complicated like I understand that
00:44:25 you know DC has to
00:44:27 have an answer to Marvel regardless
00:44:29 and they have to have some kind of balance
00:44:31 to the dark and grittiness that is
00:44:33 DC comic books because if you look at Rebirth
00:44:35 and you look at New 52
00:44:37 it's prominently like dark it's dark
00:44:39 it's scary it's violent
00:44:41 and then you have Harley Quinn
00:44:43 who yes it's still violent but
00:44:45 they have all this bubbly
00:44:47 wacky shit going on
00:44:49 it's just
00:44:51 yeah and like they
00:44:53 she has too much of a sense of humor
00:44:55 she's too wacky
00:44:57 she never takes anything seriously
00:44:59 even Deadpool has
00:45:01 his moments where he like steps back
00:45:03 Deadpool is a more serious character than modern Harley
00:45:05 holy shit the
00:45:07 the issue of Deadpool
00:45:09 Deadpool comics the one of the more
00:45:11 recent issues of Deadpool is where he is
00:45:13 trying to help out this girl who
00:45:15 he finds on top of a on top of the
00:45:17 Spider-Man's fucking I talked about that
00:45:19 in the panel cast that's right
00:45:21 that was a really great
00:45:23 did you yeah there was a there was
00:45:25 that whole arc from Brian Postsein where
00:45:27 Deadpool and Captain America
00:45:29 and Wolverine went to go fight some weapon
00:45:31 ex-bad guys and he was looking for like his old
00:45:33 girlfriend yeah was pregnant with his
00:45:35 daughter or whatever and you know
00:45:37 Deadpool finds this like mass grave of bodies
00:45:39 and in the mass grave he finds his old girlfriend
00:45:41 and
00:45:43 it's like a really sad he's like crying
00:45:45 and like yelling and Captain America is like
00:45:47 nooo
00:45:49 Deadpool has had some very intense moments like you know
00:45:51 yeah it's like they're trying to make her Deadpool
00:45:53 but they're also making her a worse Deadpool
00:45:55 because she doesn't have the
00:45:57 they're not giving her any of that pathos
00:45:59 they're not giving back the depth that she used to have
00:46:01 Deadpool still has depth and you know
00:46:03 I still get upset when people will be like
00:46:05 oh another Deadpool coming he's just another
00:46:07 wacky zany piece of shit and it's like
00:46:09 like it's not the characters fault
00:46:11 it's really not
00:46:13 and you know I guess you could say the same for Harley
00:46:15 it's not really her fault she is totally
00:46:17 marketable sex sells
00:46:19 even the Deadpool movie you know had
00:46:21 it had a core to it it had like an emotional
00:46:23 core there was none of that in the Suicide Squad
00:46:25 movie and well if in all fairness
00:46:27 Ryan Reynolds really has like a passion
00:46:29 when it comes to comic books and I know
00:46:31 that I know a lot of people will like look at the Green Lantern
00:46:33 movie and be like are you sure about that
00:46:35 statement it's like but that's not really his fault
00:46:37 he did not have he did not have
00:46:39 a great hand in the Green Lantern like he did
00:46:41 in Deadpool but anyway
00:46:43 it's just sad to me that they've you know
00:46:45 they've taken this character who had
00:46:47 so much depth to her and was such an interesting
00:46:49 character that you could write stories about
00:46:51 forever and
00:46:53 due to you know
00:46:55 marketing or misunderstanding or whatever they've
00:46:57 devolved her into this like
00:46:59 warped perversion this parody
00:47:01 of what the character once was
00:47:03 of just like
00:47:05 I'm gonna kill everybody
00:47:07 and I have a talking squirrel
00:47:09 for my best friend and
00:47:11 there's poison ivy and we're just
00:47:13 lesbians now we're just lesbians
00:47:17 I don't you know
00:47:19 it doesn't bother me and she's a wacky
00:47:21 crazy person and that's another
00:47:23 thing like the constant like the
00:47:25 the masturbatory I'm so
00:47:27 crazy shit
00:47:29 it's so it's so annoying
00:47:31 because she's not crazy
00:47:33 you can't hold me against what I do
00:47:35 because I'm a little
00:47:37 crazy
00:47:39 I'm a little loony toon girl
00:47:43 it's shit
00:47:45 she's not supposed to be
00:47:47 crazy she's just
00:47:49 dependent and she's
00:47:51 she's a thrill seeker I guess but she's not
00:47:53 psychotic like they had
00:47:55 an episode in the animated series a whole
00:47:57 episode written by Paul Dini we're like
00:47:59 at the beginning of the episode
00:48:01 she passes a test
00:48:03 and she's certified sane and she's
00:48:05 released from Arkham yeah and the whole
00:48:07 reason the only reason she ends up back
00:48:09 in Arkham at the end is because
00:48:11 she can't acclimate
00:48:13 to being free again to society's rules
00:48:15 again because she's been in this fucked
00:48:17 up lifestyle for so long it's
00:48:19 kind of like a commentary on like people
00:48:21 getting released from jail and stuff and
00:48:23 going right back because they can't acclimate
00:48:25 to society anymore right but
00:48:27 you know that's how
00:48:29 the creator of the character always wrote her
00:48:31 she's completely sane
00:48:33 she's just retarded
00:48:35 you know
00:48:37 it's one way to put it
00:48:39 she's just a flawed human being
00:48:41 and she's interesting and I know what
00:48:43 I know like the comeback to everything
00:48:45 I'm going to say is
00:48:47 well why can't the character evolve
00:48:49 why can't there be character development
00:48:51 why can't she move on from the Joker
00:48:53 money money money
00:48:55 I'm my opinion
00:48:57 it's marketability
00:48:59 I'm not saying that the character can't evolve
00:49:01 I'm all for character development
00:49:03 I've made many videos about how much
00:49:05 I love character development in all media
00:49:07 but that's no excuse
00:49:09 character development has to be natural
00:49:11 and logical you can't just
00:49:13 rewrite everything about a character
00:49:15 and like try to fit a square peg into
00:49:17 a round hole and that's what they're doing
00:49:19 with Harley Quinn they're taking a character
00:49:21 one thing and they're constantly trying
00:49:23 to ram it down our throats in a way
00:49:25 that the character shouldn't be
00:49:27 and was never intended
00:49:29 I mean you can't deny that
00:49:31 you know they won't let her evolve
00:49:33 I mean they just they won't
00:49:35 yeah she's going to be fucking
00:49:37 this crappy Deadpool thing forever
00:49:39 and you know every now and then you're going to get
00:49:41 like these glimpses of hope
00:49:43 just like these moments of clarity from her
00:49:45 and that's all you're ever going to get
00:49:47 from DC when it comes to Harley Quinn
00:49:49 right now you're not going to see
00:49:51 like any like true redeemable anything
00:49:53 coming from them because it's all about
00:49:55 what sells and Harley Quinn right
00:49:57 now regardless of how
00:49:59 we feel specifically you and I
00:50:01 because it sells
00:50:03 this new Harley Quinn
00:50:05 fucking sells do you know how I'm like
00:50:07 when the Halloween party
00:50:09 you went to how many Harley Quinn's did you see I'm curious
00:50:11 and this year's Halloween party
00:50:13 yeah I don't think I saw any
00:50:15 but I know what you mean there's always Harley Quinn's
00:50:17 like the new Harley Quinn and that's what I saw a lot of
00:50:19 and this is oh you know what yeah you're right
00:50:21 there might have been some suicide squad Harley Quinn's
00:50:23 yeah no again
00:50:25 marketability like DC needs to make money somehow
00:50:27 and if Harley Quinn
00:50:29 is going to be like that little golden
00:50:31 goose fucking egg layer
00:50:33 than whatever fine and if this
00:50:35 if this system works for them that's fine
00:50:37 but I don't I will never
00:50:39 actively read or encourage
00:50:41 Harley to anybody if they say
00:50:43 hey I've never read
00:50:45 the new Harley Quinn comics what do you think
00:50:47 I will always put into the older stuff
00:50:49 that's what I mean is that like because in the comics
00:50:51 you know she's not like the Joker's girlfriend
00:50:53 anymore anything she's like a strong independent
00:50:55 woman who needs no man and like yeah
00:50:57 so so that's like their
00:50:59 answer to all these complaints is that like
00:51:01 well no she has developed
00:51:03 as a character because she's not
00:51:05 just she hasn't developed you've just
00:51:07 changed her changing her isn't
00:51:09 developing her yeah
00:51:11 like I don't like
00:51:13 if you she had already developed
00:51:15 and not been the Joker's girlfriend anymore
00:51:17 she was like that before the new 52
00:51:19 and it was fine she developed naturally
00:51:21 well it's also been an on and off again thing
00:51:23 honestly yeah I think
00:51:25 it's only like recently like
00:51:27 post Gotham City sirens that she's finally
00:51:29 been like if you ever touch me again
00:51:31 Joker I'll fucking kill you
00:51:33 yeah which we know will never happen
00:51:35 and like the whole like crazy like
00:51:37 in the movie
00:51:39 in the Suicide Squad movie there's like a
00:51:41 brief flashback to how she became Harley
00:51:43 Quinn and it shows the Joker
00:51:45 literally giving her
00:51:47 shock treatment to make her
00:51:49 crazy
00:51:51 are you serious
00:51:53 yeah are you serious
00:51:55 like could you get it
00:51:57 more that wrong that's like
00:51:59 that's not even just wrong it's like a
00:52:01 perversion like to weigh everything
00:52:03 that's cool about her origin no
00:52:05 no god he's so much better than
00:52:07 that like I get okay so first of all I know
00:52:09 Joker is not beyond torment
00:52:11 but he's also like the thing
00:52:13 that makes him scary is that he can make
00:52:15 you fall in love with him he can make a normal
00:52:17 sane person fall in love with him
00:52:19 with just talking that's
00:52:21 like his power he is a true
00:52:23 psychopath exactly um not
00:52:25 sociopath mind you a fucking
00:52:27 psychopath yeah there is no remorse
00:52:29 he does what he does because
00:52:31 if it works it will work in his favor
00:52:33 and he knows it works electrocuting
00:52:35 somebody's brain to make them crazy like
00:52:37 you no that's not
00:52:39 that's not interesting that's not scary
00:52:41 well don't kink shame him
00:52:43 are you sure it was to make her crazy it wasn't
00:52:45 just like that's what they heavily implied
00:52:47 that he okay okay to make her
00:52:49 crazy well then I'm okay
00:52:51 that's disappointing
00:52:53 yeah um
00:52:55 well what the fuck so like yeah she's
00:52:57 not she's not like
00:52:59 a person who was
00:53:01 seduced to the dark side or
00:53:03 or lulled by the Joker into
00:53:05 becoming a worse person
00:53:07 she's just a person who was
00:53:09 basically you know just cattle
00:53:11 prod me yes she was
00:53:13 just made crazy and I guess that's how
00:53:15 shock treatment works you just become a serial killer
00:53:17 I guess so
00:53:19 I guess I've been doing it wrong
00:53:21 I read a suicide squad comic recently
00:53:23 that pissed me off so much it was this um
00:53:25 it was called it was like
00:53:27 there was like a riot at blackgate
00:53:29 prison or whatever
00:53:31 or whatever the prison is called
00:53:33 blackgate marvel okay so
00:53:35 rikers is marvel I'm just gonna have to take your word
00:53:37 for it because I have not actually read
00:53:39 a
00:53:41 suicide squad comic since kingshark
00:53:43 oh god and I
00:53:45 that's another conversation for another day
00:53:47 because kingshark I fucking
00:53:49 love kingshark but
00:53:51 let's let's not
00:53:53 I fucking love kingshark
00:53:55 I had a friend the other day he was
00:53:57 like hey um
00:53:59 you know I just saw the suicide squad
00:54:01 movie but but I heard that you know that it wasn't
00:54:03 supposed to be croc it's supposed to be kingshark
00:54:05 what what do you know about kingshark
00:54:07 and I just imagined myself like running
00:54:09 across the United States of America
00:54:11 to to blast
00:54:13 down his fucking front door all the way
00:54:15 in California and slide in
00:54:17 like a like in a baseball game
00:54:19 home base and be like let me tell you about kingshark
00:54:21 motherfucker
00:54:23 I but I have not actually
00:54:25 actively read he sounds pretty jossim
00:54:27 god
00:54:29 I will never forgive you for that
00:54:31 just so you know
00:54:33 um anyway
00:54:35 but I'm just going to have to take your word
00:54:37 for any kind of suicide squad beyond the new 52
00:54:39 original new suits and squads there was a
00:54:41 suicide squad comic
00:54:43 recently we're like it was
00:54:45 at the prison all the suicide squad bad guys
00:54:47 were there or whatever and there was
00:54:49 something
00:54:51 released into the through the vents or whatever
00:54:53 some gas or something
00:54:55 and what are you doing
00:54:57 what are you doing
00:54:59 keep talking keep talking
00:55:01 you're distracting me what the
00:55:03 I get it I see she's just
00:55:05 googling kingshark I see him
00:55:07 I'm trying to find something god damn it
00:55:09 go on
00:55:11 go on
00:55:13 oh yeah I guess you was on the flash
00:55:15 kingshark I've never watched the flash
00:55:17 no one has I don't like
00:55:19 all those fucking WB
00:55:21 I hate them all thank you go on
00:55:23 but um
00:55:25 suicide squad comic that came out recently
00:55:27 there was something in the prison in the atmosphere
00:55:29 in the vents that made everyone
00:55:31 go insane everyone went crazy
00:55:33 right all the inmates
00:55:35 lost their minds and started becoming crazy
00:55:37 people
00:55:39 but
00:55:41 because Harley Quinn
00:55:43 is already so crazy
00:55:45 it made her
00:55:47 sane again
00:55:49 that's what the storyline is called it's called sane again
00:55:51 so now that she's sane again
00:55:53 Harleen Quinzel can
00:55:55 get to the bottom of this
00:55:57 and solve this crisis
00:55:59 because that's her superpower
00:56:01 she's insane
00:56:03 she's wacky
00:56:05 this isn't
00:56:07 this is
00:56:11 ladies and gentlemen this was the day that
00:56:13 Jesse left this earth forever

01:01:09 boy I can't fucking read
01:01:11 to read that I can't fucking wait
01:01:13 oh yeah justice league vs. suicide squad
01:01:15 let's read that let's read that right now
01:01:17 let's see how they portray harleen quinzale
01:01:19 in the new justice league vs. the suicide squad
01:01:21 this is issue two I think I read issue one
01:01:23 well I don't remember it
01:01:25 yeah there's nothing to remember it's just
01:01:27 they're fighting okay no I do kind of remember
01:01:29 batman hires lobo
01:01:31 to be a good guy because that's what lobo does now
01:01:33 he's paid
01:01:35 to do what he's fucking told as long as he's paid to do it
01:01:37 so batman has paid him to be a good guy
01:01:39 holy shit
01:01:41 bonus though it is
01:01:43 the old school
01:01:45 lobo that we all grew up with
01:01:47 oh yeah
01:01:49 however
01:01:51 what the fuck
01:01:53 did you ever read the new 52 lobo
01:01:55 I did not
01:01:57 nor will I ever you don't need to
01:01:59 okay so for those of you who
01:02:01 haven't read the new 52 lobo
01:02:03 or even if you have
01:02:05 you know it doesn't matter I'm gonna say it anyway
01:02:07 the new 52 lobo
01:02:09 when it came out
01:02:11 they basically tried to say that the old school lobo
01:02:13 that we all knew and loved
01:02:15 you know the one from the superman animated series
01:02:17 you know a big bully voiced by brad garret
01:02:19 that glorious
01:02:21 hound of a man
01:02:23 he uh
01:02:25 he was an imposter
01:02:27 he was never the real lobo
01:02:29 if you didn't know that
01:02:31 the real lobo was
01:02:33 basically the model for the front cover
01:02:35 of a romance novel
01:02:37 he was this handsome
01:02:39 muscular like pretty boy
01:02:41 something had a final fantasy almost
01:02:43 and they decided they were gonna make him
01:02:45 the new lobo
01:02:47 he was gonna kill the old lobo if I remember correctly
01:02:49 if I don't remember correctly fuck you I don't care
01:02:51 this new lobo
01:02:53 has me all sorts of discombobulated
01:02:55 and the new lobo
01:02:57 um
01:02:59 he so he could basically
01:03:01 do anything that the old lobo could do
01:03:03 except he if I remember correctly
01:03:05 had like super ridiculous
01:03:07 regenerative powers like
01:03:09 Deadpool level regenerative powers
01:03:11 like if you cut off his head he'd probably be
01:03:13 fucking fine in like an hour or two or something
01:03:15 fucking no
01:03:17 and you know
01:03:19 there was already a lot about the new 52 lobo
01:03:21 that I didn't like
01:03:23 but I read all the way through it anyway
01:03:25 just so that I could try to you know understand
01:03:27 it and DC
01:03:29 and why people read it
01:03:31 and I'm not saying that there were a lot of people that read it
01:03:33 I did not have very many
01:03:35 sub customers that had it on their sub
01:03:37 I'd say maybe like three or four tops
01:03:39 and there might have been more at one point
01:03:41 but you know they all dropped it
01:03:43 and a whole lot of people tried to subscribe to it to begin with
01:03:45 they just kind of like picked it up one day and were like
01:03:47 yeah I guess they'll take a look at it
01:03:49 maybe it'll be good
01:03:51 and it just stayed on their sub for whatever reason
01:03:53 there's like you know fuck it I guess I'll just finish it
01:03:55 um but
01:03:57 there's this entire scene
01:03:59 where lobo, new 52 lobo
01:04:01 is pitted against the red lantern core
01:04:03 and he
01:04:05 fucking kills all of them he kills them
01:04:07 he kills the red lantern core
01:04:09 he tears apart
01:04:11 atrocidus, he tears apart the cat
01:04:13 I'm going to fart again
01:04:15 look out
01:04:17 nooooooooooooo well
01:04:19 nooo
01:04:21 oo I'm shitting my pants
01:04:23 ouch
01:04:29 oh
01:04:35 that's how I felt
01:04:36 I shit myself
01:04:38 We're gonna keep going anyway, so
01:04:41 That's that's basically how I felt, you know in all fairness though. They did renege on that later. They they basically
01:04:49 Now who's saying the n-word?
01:04:53 Tell me more about how they reneged. I I have an excuse
01:04:57 I've been drinking is um when everyone's injured and your basketball team only has white people
01:05:02 Do you need to renege before the big game?
01:05:05 Suck my balls
01:05:07 suck em
01:05:08 In all fairness they they did to go back and they basically said that oh just kidding the red lantern course still lives
01:05:14 Do you think that after four years of Trump in the White House America's gonna want to renege? Of course they are
01:05:20 You know did you know that Obama actually said that if he ran for president again?
01:05:24 He'd win again. It's like against Trump or whatever. I don't fuck. He doesn't matter
01:05:27 You're not allowed to run. You're not allowed to have a third term. No, you're not. It's an American thing
01:05:32 Does it matter I don't know anything about politics welcome to the politics cast and now we're talking about you know
01:05:38 What else pisses me off about Harley Quinn the whole the whole bleaching her skin thing
01:05:43 How the Joker now her new origin is that he bleached her skin to look more like yeah, hold the fucking phone
01:05:50 When did that happen? It was not a new 50 that was a new 52 thing. Yeah, I remember now
01:05:55 I did not like that. Okay. She used to be such a cutie pie
01:05:58 She'd take off her outfit and her makeup and she'd be normal
01:06:01 So before before new 52 Gotham City sirens actually ended right as the new 52 started it and in Gotham City sirens
01:06:09 She did not have bleached skin. She was a she was an adorable little
01:06:13 Harling Quinzel and I loved her. I loved Gotham City sirens. I love Gillum
01:06:19 What's his face is artwork even though he didn't finish the series he started it and it was wonderful
01:06:23 And then he started the Catwoman series from new 52, and I liked that series while it lasted but anyway
01:06:29 Um
01:06:30 Yeah, why did they bleach her skin? You know what's the point? You know what's cool about Harley Quinn?
01:06:35 I'm gonna drink some more is that she's not she wasn't just the Joker's girlfriend. She was his number one
01:06:41 Lacky she was his bottom bitch
01:06:43 She was based she was like his Robin and she could do things that the Joker couldn't like for example
01:06:50 Walk into a place like a normal person and like be in disguise because she doesn't look like the fucking Joker
01:06:56 She looks like a regular person. That's that's that's like what that's like her superpower
01:07:00 That's her asset to the Joker as a lackey
01:07:03 It's not just her glorious tiny little pussy that he loves getting inside with his nasty green tongue
01:07:11 It's the fact that she can that she can take the makeup off and sneak into places for him and like mingle and shit
01:07:18 So isn't the Joker supposed to be like an evil genius isn't he supposed to be smart?
01:07:23 How fucking stupid is it for him to like make her look like him? That's taking away that asset
01:07:28 I think okay, so I have a theory already on that
01:07:31 I think they did it to try and emphasize the whole abusive situation
01:07:34 I think they tried to make it to where he was marking her. Yeah, no, that's how I feel to you
01:07:38 I don't yeah fucking jerk it off. Whatever jerk it off
01:07:42 But that makes sense, right? I like they want to emphasize the abusive part of the of the relationship
01:07:49 I think it all just came from wanting everyone to have edgy new hot topic. He redesigned in the new 52
01:07:54 Yeah, I wanted her with the black and red pig tails and the white skin. That's probably an even better
01:08:01 I think it was purely idiotic marketing that did that. I remember that scene
01:08:06 I remember it was kind of rapey to like he dips her in there and like when he takes her out
01:08:10 He's like holding her like firmly by the chin and she's like sucking in her bottom like like nervously
01:08:15 He's doing his little like Joker grin. I remember. Oh dear god. I tried to forget and you reminded me and now I'm gonna drink some more
01:08:25 Yeah, yeah
01:08:29 Fuck
01:08:32 I
01:08:32 I'm just gonna say I hate new Harley Quinn. I hate I hate it. I've I can't bring myself to
01:08:41 I'm not again. I'm not gonna
01:08:44 No, I am I'm gonna kink shame people
01:08:48 Clarify trying to be a good person, but Harley Quinn in this current era does not make me a good person
01:08:56 Helps me in any kind of way. I don't like it. I don't think she has depth. I don't like the way she looks
01:09:00 I don't like anything about the new Harley Quinn. It just needs to stop
01:09:03 And I and I hate how much how much they push the whole lesbian thing now with her and poison Ivy
01:09:08 Like they really ram it down your throats in these comics, you know Tumblr loves it
01:09:14 You know
01:09:16 Like Paul Dini always hinted at it. It used to be like a oh, yeah, you make me so thorny. Yeah
01:09:22 Yeah, like it was always like okay. Yeah, we get it there. They're probably munching some carpet behind closed doors
01:09:28 That's that's cool. That's cute. We get it, but now it's just like okay
01:09:32 We fucking get it like every other comic is then like hey
01:09:36 I think you want a fucking finger me in the puss
01:09:40 You want a finger my puss?
01:09:43 Yeah, I want to finger your puss. How about you finger my puss, baby? That's my poison ivy. That's a pretty good poison ivy
01:09:50 I'll come here to kill all men and finger some puss. That's the Megan Fox poison
01:09:56 Megan Fox poison ivy. I can't wait
01:09:58 I
01:10:02 Can't wait with her. I guess you'll have a green thumb
01:10:08 Cuz Megan Fox is known for her gross thumbs. I've never seen her thumbs. Is it like is it like Danny's that's like a meme
01:10:15 Megan Fox has toe thumbs. Oh
01:10:17 Like short thumbs like their toes
01:10:21 So not is it on the same level as like Danny sex being thumbs
01:10:25 What's wrong with any sex banks thumbs, oh they always make fun of Danny sex veins thumbs Megan Fox thumbs. Oh
01:10:35 Yeah, I guess she does have kind of stubby thumbs. Yeah, that's really gross
01:10:39 Oh
01:10:40 My god, it's worse than I thought
01:10:43 God look up Danny sex banks. Oh
01:10:47 It's like if her thumb was a person it would have no knees
01:10:51 Oh
01:10:52 Still like cotton from King of the Hill
01:10:55 Did her thumbs kill Fiddy man? Yeah, she's got cotton thumbs. Oh my god
01:11:04 Stop doing oh good for you and how was it? Oh
01:11:13 No, they can Fox discusses her wonky thumbs
01:11:17 I
01:11:19 Don't want to look at her ever again
01:11:22 Well, you're gonna because she's they're talking about making her the new poison ivy
01:11:29 Mmm, don't do it. I like it. I don't don't do it
01:11:32 You know who was a good they made her April O'Neill too. That was a mistake
01:11:37 What that whole movie was a what is it with what is it with like perfect beautiful redheads being ruined by Megan Fox?
01:11:43 You know, one of my favorite things that I remember you saying about the TMNT movie when it first came out was you know, like
01:11:50 splinter
01:11:51 Learns karate. Oh, yeah through a book
01:11:55 Yeah, and I'm like yeah, and you're like well
01:11:59 It's good to know that there is no God. Yeah
01:12:03 That's the that's the the the turtles the 2012 one
01:12:08 Splinter finds a karate book in the garbage and that's where he learns to be a ninja
01:12:13 You know what you know what's been oh?
01:12:16 Jesse what what did you read any of the Batman TMNT comic books? Of course?
01:12:21 I did I have it have you wrote the new one the one that's based on the new cartoon. It's actually it's the Batman animated
01:12:29 And the TMNT like the current generation I guess on Nickelodeon. I did not it's actually good
01:12:35 It's actually fucking good. Okay. I don't like the new TMNT like cartoon for the most part
01:12:40 Like I'll watch it and kind of humor myself with it every now and then but I can't like watch it consistently
01:12:45 But thankfully with comic books you don't have to listen to voices. You only have the voices that are in your own head
01:12:52 But the the new Batman TMNT adventures are actually really good
01:12:57 So if you haven't read it yet, I do recommend it
01:13:00 I do feel like a lot of people are like oh well
01:13:02 It's not going to be as dark and gritty because you know
01:13:05 It's Batman going into their universe as opposed to the TMNT going into his universe
01:13:09 But it's good like I want to say trust me, but you know to each their own. I enjoyed it
01:13:23 I
01:13:23 Can't think of anything else to talk about. Yeah, that's comics for you. They're all shit. They're all bad
01:13:27 I don't like them. That's not true. Did we like some of them? I don't even remember which ones we liked
01:13:32 We oh, yeah, I read all the new Doctor Strange recently
01:13:36 You did tell me all about it caught up on that. Oh, I haven't read this one yet
01:13:39 So I haven't read the newest one. Okay, so you read up to 14. Tell me all about it. It's really good. I like it
01:13:44 It's um, I like the artwork a lot. So did you ever read Jason Aaron's?
01:13:50 Original Thor run his God Bomb arc
01:13:53 No, I was never really a big fan of Thor. I love Thor. He's a good boy. He didn't do nothing wrong
01:13:59 You know, you're probably right
01:14:01 I've just I've never taken the time out to actually like actively read anything by Thor again
01:14:05 Same with the movies like I enjoyed the movies, but they're not my favorite. I don't know
01:14:09 Thor was a good boy. He didn't deserve to get replaced by a woman. It was wrong
01:14:13 Whoa
01:14:16 Oh
01:14:17 Massagerist over here. Shut up. What's wrong with a woman for?
01:14:23 You guys can't see it, but I'm trying to do the trout mouth that the trout mouth that a that
01:14:29 Tumblr social justice warriors do what's wrong with Thor being a woman
01:14:37 So um, so this is Dr. Strange Jason Aaron wrote this he also wrote Thor for a long he's been writing Thor for like seven years
01:14:45 Stop it
01:14:51 So are you are you saying that all social justice warriors are ugly
01:14:55 I'm sorry go on saying that all people are ugly until proven innocent
01:15:01 Jason Aaron wrote a Thor comic and his Dr. Strange comic is basically the same comic
01:15:06 It's the same his first arc in Dr. Strange is like the same as his first arc in Thor
01:15:11 We're like in Thor it was this guy there was this guy called gore who hated gods and he wanted to kill all the gods and
01:15:18 In Dr. Strange
01:15:20 There's this guy who hates magic and he wants to kill all the magics. I can relate to both of them
01:15:27 But it's really cool
01:15:28 He like you can tell that he's really you know
01:15:31 It's it's for because of the movie and they're trying to make Dr. Strange like a lot more relatable and down to earth and stuff
01:15:36 So Dr. Strange in this is like a regular guy who has to deal with a lot of magical bullshit. He has to eat gross food
01:15:42 He hates it. He's always sick. He uh, he has to see his fight monsters. He goes into like this a special bar
01:15:49 That only magic people can go into
01:15:52 Like Dr. Voodoo was in there
01:15:54 Eliana Rasputin is in there and like Scarlet Witch and they all hang out and do magic stuff together. They have drinks
01:15:59 Yeah, yeah, and they and so these guys are killing all the magic. They take all the magic out of the world
01:16:05 And Dr. Strange has to fight back
01:16:07 And it's cool and they really they try to like I don't know if I'm too far from the mic
01:16:11 I feel like I'm scooting away from it. They they they introduced this concept or of like all magic
01:16:18 coming from somewhere like it um like
01:16:21 You know every time that Dr. Strange uses magic unbeknownst to him. There's always a price somewhere
01:16:28 so like
01:16:31 There's a bunch of people and a and a so like Wong has a bunch of dudes in a secret temple somewhere that Dr.
01:16:37 Strange doesn't know about like taking all the pain from all of his magic that he uses what the fuck
01:16:42 Yeah, and it's very it's interesting and it's cool and he fights the guy
01:16:46 But then at the end of it um
01:16:48 At the end of that story arc. It's like it's taking all the magic out of the world
01:16:54 Or like it's taking a significant amount of the magic out of the world
01:16:57 I was gonna say that might explain the new Dr. Strange versus the punters
01:17:00 Well, it's not like just a punter sure which it it seems like you know
01:17:05 That's like a big shift in the status quo
01:17:07 But it's such it's so vague that it's not really a shift at all like oh you've taken out most of the magic in the world
01:17:14 Well, what does that mean? He's still using magic. Yeah, like every like now in the in now
01:17:20 It's like oh ever since the magic was taken out of the world doing this is a lot harder
01:17:25 And then he does magic and he doesn't so it's kind of a pointless not really much of a shift in that
01:17:31 It's not much of a shit status quo shift in all fairness that may have tried and attempt was made
01:17:36 I was gonna say you know fairness it might affect other characters in the long run. I'm sure we'll see it
01:17:41 We'll see some of it later
01:17:44 But go on. I'm sorry
01:17:46 Well, that's basically it. I mean
01:17:48 Then the second story I picked up and right now he's in a car
01:17:51 It's driven by the orb the guy at the eyeball for a face and I haven't read this issue yet
01:17:54 But I'll get to it. I really like the new Dr. Strange. Yeah, I like it. It's been good
01:18:01 You know, I think Dr. Strange is kind of an interesting character in the sense that
01:18:05 You know, even though he's in the Marvel Universe and there's even a movie out for him now
01:18:08 Which you and I both saw and talked about a little bit on the last podcast, but
01:18:13 You know
01:18:15 You know, he's not exactly the easiest character to just kind of slip into any Marvel comic book
01:18:22 It's like constant teen, you know, yeah
01:18:24 like you can't just throw him in with anybody and I say that of course after they immediately throw him together with a
01:18:31 Punisher but
01:18:34 There's just so much to Dr. Strange and his abilities that it almost feels pointless to try and get him to team up with anybody else
01:18:42 because
01:18:43 You remember Civil War, you're a member like the first Civil War run where punish your killed like five guys
01:18:49 But but you know spider-in's like hey, Dr. Strange. I need you to do me a favor. I need you to
01:18:56 Help I need you to get everybody to forget that I ever revealed my identity to anybody. Yeah
01:19:01 And you know, Dr. Strange like I'll carry you got one and the spider island happens and spider. Oh, no, Dr. Strange said
01:19:08 No, that's impossible. Even I can't do that, but it happens. Anyway, maybe if you if you if you strike up a deal with Satan
01:19:14 Yeah, maybe that maybe that can do it
01:19:18 Yeah, I don't god I do remember
01:19:23 He did something I could have swore like up and down that he fucking did something in Civil War along that vein
01:19:29 Because I remember in the amazing spider-man's run of spider island where spider is like hey
01:19:36 Dr. Strange, can you do me? Can you do me another favor and Dr. Strange like no, and he just like fucks off forever
01:19:45 You know whatever maybe I'm getting things mixed up
01:19:49 but anyway, I
01:19:51 Really like the new Dr. Strange run. I like the artwork. I like the character. I like the way that he's written
01:19:57 I like the dialogue. I like
01:19:59 There's a lot about the new like Dr. Strange
01:20:01 There's very few like Marvel comics and I actively like sit and go. Yeah, this is fucking good
01:20:07 Dr. Strange is one of those titles
01:20:09 But this is also coming from the same person who says that full killer full killer is fucking fantastic
01:20:14 Which I stand by that. Holy shit. It's a fucking fantastic comic book
01:20:18 Totally underrated for anybody who hasn't been reading it. It's great
01:20:21 I know Jess hasn't been reading it, but you know, I don't did you even read Merck's like the Merck's for no
01:20:27 Merck's for money, I guess it's called. Nah, I'm looking at this DC holiday special right now
01:20:33 Oh with Harley Quinn more Harley Quinn all the Harley Quinn hey the suicide squad Harley Quinn
01:20:39 Hey, she looks pretty sexy right there with your legs spread open open in that present the present
01:20:44 That's in front of her box the box that's in front of her box. I'm uh, yeah, I like that I
01:20:51 Like Batman sipping on the tiny cup of tea
01:20:54 That's my fetish
01:20:58 But anyway, I
01:21:01 Don't if you're not reading Dr. Strange, I recommend it
01:21:06 You know, there's so very few Marvel titles. Like I said that I actually actively read
01:21:11 Dr. Strange is actually one of those titles that I currently read and
01:21:14 Fool killers another one that actively read before that was vision
01:21:17 Which you know, Jesse and I both talked about vision already
01:21:20 But I'm just gonna fucking say it again. If you didn't pick up vision yet do it
01:21:25 There's only two volumes and they're both fucking glorious
01:21:33 That's right and that's is that it is that that's the panel cast everybody
01:21:41 Comics suck and we hate them the end
