00:00:00 Do-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu.
00:00:03 Hi, everyone! Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:06 Hey, it's just me. It's just Ben here.
00:00:08 And I'm here making a protest bonus episode.
00:00:13 Not a bonus episode, but some extra, extra content.
00:00:18 PCP, extra credit.
00:00:22 It's protest. I object. I object, sir.
00:00:26 To the last episode,
00:00:27 Tom and Gibb did a great job, did a bang-up job, loved the episode, 10 out of 10 quality content.
00:00:38 However, I was thrown into a blind fury that so few of the voicemails will listen to.
00:00:46 I believe in egalitarianism, I believe in voicemail anarchy, I believe that all voicemails, even the shittiest voicemails,
00:00:56 deserve a chance to prove themselves in the marketplace of ideas.
00:01:01 And so here, now, for you, I'm gonna make a stand.
00:01:09 I'm gonna stand against tyranny, I'm gonna stand against exclusion, I'm gonna stand against the PCP oligarchs that run everything,
00:01:20 the fat cats that are trying to keep the little guy down.
00:01:23 I'm here, what you want to say, I want to hear it, and that's what we're gonna do today.
00:01:31 And I apologize in advance.
00:01:34 So, without further ado.
00:01:36 Wait, where did my notes?
00:01:38 Where's my notes?
00:01:40 There they are.
00:01:41 Without further ado, let's get into it, shall we?
00:01:44 Now two episodes ago, the last episode, the last voicemail was from Darren the Red.
00:01:50 So the next one we got is from, it's from someone called
00:01:55 Listen to this, ooh-ooh, and there's a huge,
00:01:59 there's a link, there's a link.
00:02:04 Anyway, let's hear the voicemail.
00:02:08 Please enjoy this extended rating
00:02:11 of a tweet thread directed to Ben Sinked.
00:02:15 Oh, I know what this is, I know what this is.
00:02:18 This is the, this is the, this is that, that, that.
00:02:25 The hate thread, the hate thread I received on Twitter.
00:02:33 It's another extended read.
00:02:35 All right, I'll put the link in the description.
00:02:38 This is the second dramatic reading
00:02:40 of that legendary tweet thread that I have heard,
00:02:44 but it never gets old.
00:02:47 Thank you very much.
00:02:50 Next up, we've got Salad Boys.
00:02:56 Hey, what's your favorite salad?
00:03:01 Grrr.
00:03:02 Okay, you know what?
00:03:04 Just today I invented a new salad, a hamburger salad.
00:03:10 I'll tell you the recipe right now.
00:03:12 You put lettuce in your bowl, right?
00:03:15 That's garnish, whatever.
00:03:16 And then you cook, you cook your brown beef in a pot,
00:03:21 and then you throw in chopped cauliflower, steam it,
00:03:25 steam it till it's soft, leave it hot, crack eggs into it.
00:03:30 Just crack eggs into it, leave it in the pot covered.
00:03:35 15 minutes or so, the eggs will steam,
00:03:37 they will, they will cook in there.
00:03:39 The yolks will still be runny, that's what you want.
00:03:41 Chop it up, mash it up, mix it up, switch it around.
00:03:44 Salt, pepper, mozzarella.
00:03:46 Swirl it around, becomes kind of like a mush.
00:03:48 That's what you want, kind of a jumble.
00:03:52 Scoop it into the bowl on top of the lettuce.
00:03:57 Ketchup and mustard on top.
00:03:59 This is apparently controversial.
00:04:02 Some people don't believe in ketchup and mustard on burgers.
00:04:04 I think that's frankly un-American.
00:04:09 Garnish with a pickle, spear, obviously, no slices.
00:04:13 And there you go, a hamburger salad.
00:04:15 For me, you boy, Ben St, enjoy, it's low carb.
00:04:20 Cut out the ketchup if you're really concerned about sugar.
00:04:23 So that's my new favorite salad, and I'm so glad
00:04:26 I got the opportunity to tell you all about it.
00:04:30 Next up, we've got the big C question.
00:04:34 Let's hear it.
00:04:35 Okay, so I got a quick salad question here.
00:04:39 You know, whenever you're eating a salad,
00:04:42 do you ever add croutons on, like, everyone's into croutons?
00:04:45 It's nachito.
00:04:46 Except for me, it seems.
00:04:47 So like, what's the deal?
00:04:49 What's the appeal of croutons?
00:04:51 And if you do, what's the best quality of croutons?
00:04:55 And why do you like it?
00:04:57 Thank you.
00:04:58 I like croutons.
00:04:59 They're just like garlic bread, but hard and crunchy.
00:05:03 That's the appeal.
00:05:04 It's very obvious, but I don't need them anymore
00:05:06 because they're nachito.
00:05:08 Thanks for calling in.
00:05:10 Next up, we've got fruit burp.
00:05:13 Here we go.
00:05:16 Progressioners, what's your favorite fruit
00:05:18 to have for fruit salad, my dudes?
00:05:20 Fuck fruit salad.
00:05:21 I don't know.
00:05:23 Pineapple, I guess?
00:05:25 I don't know.
00:05:27 Pineapple.
00:05:29 Next one, we've got brobroni.
00:05:33 Here it comes, coming at ya.
00:05:36 So Jenny Nicholson recently put out a video
00:05:41 looking at the history of bronies and bronicon.
00:05:46 And as someone who isn't that into the whole brony thing,
00:05:51 I thought it was a pretty interesting deep dive
00:05:53 into the subculture.
00:05:55 Since y'all have a past in that,
00:05:57 I just want to know what your reactions to it were
00:06:00 and if you had any dissenting opinions
00:06:04 against what she said.
00:06:05 Thanks.
00:06:07 Hearing Jenny, I watched the video.
00:06:09 I really enjoyed it.
00:06:10 Hearing Jenny talk about bronicon,
00:06:13 in brony, ponydom in general,
00:06:16 and the last bronycon in specific,
00:06:19 throat's dry, I got some seltzer.
00:06:21 I got some sparkling water.
00:06:26 Delightful.
00:06:27 Hearing Jenny talk about that was like,
00:06:30 was like reminiscing about the good old days
00:06:32 with a friend, you know, you just,
00:06:34 Munchy didn't like it,
00:06:35 because Munchy said that he thought it was very surface
00:06:37 level, like duh, everyone knows that.
00:06:39 And like, yes, I did already know everything she had to say.
00:06:43 So in the sense, I agree.
00:06:45 But I think that's really dumb.
00:06:46 And I disagree, I thought it was really fun.
00:06:48 It's like when you get together with someone,
00:06:50 you go, hey, remember that, remember that,
00:06:51 you reminisce about the good old days
00:06:52 and you just have a good time,
00:06:54 just sort of bouncing these ideas around.
00:06:57 Just hearing them, just repeat them for old times sake
00:06:59 because it's fun.
00:07:01 That's what I liked about it.
00:07:02 And it was great.
00:07:03 I loved it.
00:07:04 I thought she was a little weird about like the,
00:07:08 she seemed a little judgy,
00:07:10 not just about like the, like,
00:07:12 she mentions like having like fillies on pillows
00:07:15 and like, I get that.
00:07:17 I don't know if I like that so much,
00:07:19 but like, she seemed a little judgy
00:07:20 just about like porn in general,
00:07:22 which like, I don't know,
00:07:24 get over yourself, like everyone jerks off to everything.
00:07:27 Like it's, why are you acting like it's weird?
00:07:29 I don't know.
00:07:30 I don't understand that part.
00:07:31 But other than that, everything about like,
00:07:34 you know, when she talks about like some outsized egos
00:07:38 from people who were not famous,
00:07:40 the other like 20, 360 days of the year,
00:07:43 but then they get like weird rock star complexes at,
00:07:46 I was like, yes, I want 100%.
00:07:49 That was me a little bit, maybe just a little bit.
00:07:52 I mean, I wasn't, I don't think I was a dick about it,
00:07:53 but like, I know that feeling.
00:07:55 Like, I knew people, I saw people being like that
00:07:58 and to a little bit, I was that.
00:08:00 And it's just like, how silly,
00:08:03 how silly of a time to look back upon and reflect.
00:08:07 So those are my thoughts about that.
00:08:10 Next one, next one is from The Jocker Threat,
00:08:13 which they did, Tom and Hippo did, listen to,
00:08:16 good on them, good job, credit where credits do.
00:08:20 Next one is called I'm Ben Saint,
00:08:24 and there's a YouTube video attached, so let's hear it.
00:08:28 I'm Ben Saint.
00:08:29 Okay.
00:08:31 All right.
00:08:32 Let's check, let's check this video out.
00:08:38 This is a certified,
00:08:39 oh it's a,
00:08:40 I'm Ben Saint.
00:08:42 It's a song.
00:08:42 I'm Ben Saint, oh I'm Ben Saint.
00:08:45 I'm Ben Saint, oh I'm Ben Saint.
00:08:48 I'm Ben Saint, oh I'm Ben Saint.
00:08:50 I'm Ben Saint, Oh I'm Ben Saint.
00:08:52 The lyrics are,
00:08:53 yo, bitch I'm Ben Saint over and over again.
00:08:56 Oh, no, there's lyrics. There's lyrics. There's gunshots. Okay, I'm not gonna listen to this
00:09:06 whole thing right now. Link in the description. Go listen to Starman's, I'm Ben St, featuring
00:09:14 Simon. Dab. It's a banger. The screenshot is, what is this aspect ratio? It's in square
00:09:25 aspect ratio. Why? But it's me eating PCP killer pills, which I appreciate. It's true.
00:09:33 It's true. Killed it, baby. Next one. Daydream Honeybee. Let's see what you bring with the
00:09:42 table.
00:09:43 It has been brought to my attention that in addition to committing the capital sin that
00:09:49 is crustless key to pizza, Ben St, whom you might know for having dug himself into
00:09:55 a hole where what personality he had that made him unique and defined has what interested
00:09:59 until it become indistinguishable from the cultic ideologues he now parrots and promotes
00:10:05 has been wasting perfectly functional nitroglycerin components on candies. I naturally hope that
00:10:13 is ashamed of himself, but I'd like to know at the very least if those chemicals haven't
00:10:21 been wasted in vain. So tell us, Ben St, when was the last time you had an original thought,
00:10:30 Ben St? I thought that, oh excuse me, I'm still reading Ash of Empires' excellent thread.
00:10:36 Anyways, the people want to know, where them gamys any good? Answer, Ben St.
00:10:47 You know, I made a, the other day, I was cooking it, I was cooking gelatin, right? I put all
00:10:56 this, right? Because, alright, to make gelatin with no lumps, you got to have like a high
00:11:03 ratio of gelatin to water, right? I have found that I can get away with maybe like one tablespoon
00:11:10 of gelatin in a quarter of a cup of water. And I can only do that by using like a wide
00:11:17 pan and putting the water in the wide pan and then sprinkling the gelatin on like over
00:11:21 the very top to get to the maximum surface area. Because the key to smooth gelatin is
00:11:26 you have to let all the granules hydrate. They must be spread out through the water,
00:11:30 they must have contact with the water in order to hydrate. And if they're clumped up together
00:11:34 or you dump it in one spoonful, it's going to clump, it's going to be hard and chewy,
00:11:38 it's going to make lumps, it's going to be bad. You have to get it smooth. And so that's
00:11:43 the best ratio I can get, but it's still not enough. If you do that, it is still too watery
00:11:49 and your gummies will come out too wet. So I had to do that and then cook it down. I
00:11:54 cooked it down to about two thirds of that level. It started at six cups, cooked it down
00:11:58 to four cups. Honestly, I think maybe I should have taken a little further, but that's what
00:12:02 I did. And then I used the last of my previous Jell-O that I had done. I had made a big batch
00:12:09 of it and kept chunks of it for heating up later. I used the last of it and the last
00:12:15 of the isomaltooligosaccharide syrup that I had cooked down to a cooking temperature
00:12:21 of 120 degrees Celsius, which at which point it becomes dense enough, it's dehydrated enough
00:12:28 that at room temperature, it becomes hard. You have to heat it up for it to become liquid
00:12:32 so that you can pour it and work with it. So you heat that up, you heat the gelatin
00:12:36 up, you mix it together and mix it together. And I put in the last of my mango flavoring
00:12:40 and blah, blah, blah. And it turned out this batch came out a little fucked up because
00:12:45 I did not put enough gelatin in. It was too syrupy. It's too stretchy, but also it like
00:12:50 froze on the inside. So it's like, it's too stretchy and gooey. It's not gummy-ish enough.
00:12:57 It's not solid enough or chewy enough, but it's also got these like hard lumps on the
00:13:01 inside. It's not gelatin clumps. It's like the syrup. It's like chunks of the hardened
00:13:08 syrup as though it were room temperature. It didn't mix into the gelatin well enough.
00:13:12 The flavor is like overpowering. I put the last of the mango in so I just kind of dumped
00:13:17 the rest in and it was too much. It's too strong. It's overpowering. It's unpleasant.
00:13:21 So that was the last batch I made and I'm not willing to throw them away. So I've just
00:13:26 kind of been like having one every like eat like part of it and try to avoid the hard bits
00:13:30 like, okay, I like the tanginess. Even if the flavor is a little weird. So I've been working
00:13:35 my way through that. I have another batch of the cooked down gelatin in the fridge. I made
00:13:39 a lot of it, but I still have to cook down more of the syrup because at like normal temperature,
00:13:46 the concentration I have it mixed at right now is unworkable. I have to cook it down.
00:13:51 It's very important that the final product not be too wet or it's just like bleh. So
00:13:57 this last batch was not great, but I have had good batch. I've had a couple of really
00:14:01 good batches lately actually. So yes, I guess, yes, question mark is the answer. Lamal.
00:14:10 Next one was from smear, which they listened to on the episode. So I'll skip that for now.
00:14:15 Forever. Look, next one is from Woo Woo. Here we go.
00:14:19 Hello, a PCP. I was wondering, what, do you like, do you like pineapple in your salad?
00:14:34 I already said yes. I already said pineapple was my favorite fruit in a fruit salad. You
00:14:41 know what, you know what, you know, let me, I like, if I'm in the right mood, sometimes
00:14:51 a fruit salad has like cherries in it, not like maraschino cherries, not like the ones
00:14:55 in the soup, but like the fresh ones, a little dark red ones. I might, I like those because
00:15:01 like you can like pick them up and eat them and they still taste like a cherry. They don't
00:15:04 have that in a fruit salad. You know, I take it back. It's not pineapple because pineapple
00:15:10 absorbs the flavor of all the other. I don't like it. I don't like it in a fruit salad.
00:15:14 It all, each of the fruits absorb one another's flavors. I hate that. And pineapple is guilty
00:15:19 of that. So pineapple might be one of my favorite fruits of the fruits among the fruit salad,
00:15:22 but in a fruit salad, loses its individuality and I don't like it as much. So I'm going
00:15:27 to amend my quest, I'm going to amend my answer to cherries, but only the fresh kind, not
00:15:30 the soggy kind. Next one, the tea question. We need to address the elephant in the room,
00:15:38 the tea question, the tiny Timmy question. This guy submit so many goddamn voice mails
00:15:44 every week and everyone agrees that they're shit. How is he not in the voice jail by now?
00:15:51 Look, I know I'm not one to point fingers, but Jesus Christ man, he submits like 10 fucking
00:15:56 voice mails a week and now that they're democratized and they're all being played, it's fucking
00:16:01 hell. I've exacerbated the problem. I don't remember which ones are Timmy and which ones
00:16:08 are not. I'm actually pretty bad at distinguishing voices. So for my part, most of the time I
00:16:14 probably don't even realize when I'm playing a Timmy voicemail. So, I don't know. Whoops.
00:16:24 Next one, BGE monthly cast. What's that? Hey guys, don't want to turn this into the fucking
00:16:31 Nate podcast or anything, but just because you guys mentioned it last episode, yeah,
00:16:37 Nate does have a patron only podcast that he does, but what do you know? What's today?
00:16:43 August 1st, and he didn't release one in July. What do you know?
00:16:49 Okay, thanks for the update, my man. Next one's Margar, already played it. Skipped
00:17:01 it. Next one, Dirty Hippie with a clean butthole. Let's see what that's all about.
00:17:08 So I was like hanging out with my fellow dudes or whatever and like while they were taking
00:17:16 turns eating on my asshole, I was like, why do they call it getting your salad tossed?
00:17:23 And I was like, what kind of salad would my asshole be? I don't know, bro, but what kind
00:17:29 of salad would your asshole be? It would be a fruit salad because I am gay. It would
00:17:43 be a hamburger cauliflower salad because it just would be, I don't know, that's just
00:17:51 how God made me. Thanks for your input. Next one, please God you stupid fucks.
00:18:00 This is a criticism of the PCP. Every single fucking episode, someone believes a sarcastic
00:18:05 voicemail like, I'm a person with dumb opinions, I believe this in every single time, without
00:18:10 fail. Someone's like, man, why does this person believe this dumb thing? These aren't text
00:18:16 messages, you can hear tone, you can hear the tone of my voice right now. You can hear
00:18:20 the tone of their voice, you can hear them going like, I believe that communism is bad.
00:18:25 And then Ben's like, communism isn't bad. Like Jesus Christ, this person is agreeing with
00:18:30 you, please, please God, okay, that's all. I don't just feel bad, feel bad about yourselves.
00:18:36 Thank you.
00:18:37 Okay, thank you. I will take it under advisement. I apologize for everything. What do you think
00:18:46 everyone? Do we not pick up on social cues? Okay, next one is from crack and I know they
00:18:54 played this one on the episode, but I have, I have reason to believe that there's more
00:18:58 to this one. So I'm going to play it again for context.
00:19:01 Hey Ben, did you see all the tweets about UFOs being real?
00:19:04 No.
00:19:05 It's really funny how everybody was saying Space Jam was real when they canceled the
00:19:08 NBA for the virus and now aliens are just real. You're an astronomer, retired space
00:19:14 counselor. I know you're on top of it. Just thinking about you.
00:19:19 I, I don't know about aliens being real. I didn't see anyone saying Space Jam was real
00:19:26 when the NBA was canceled. But these concepts are not so outlandish that I cannot close
00:19:35 my eyes and visualize and see them as though, as though they're coming true before my eyes.
00:19:42 Okay, I can see it now. I understand. I can infer context. Okay, got it.
00:19:48 Next one, Mickey Mouse.
00:19:51 Hey Ben, we're in a real dilly of a pickle here down at Walt Disney World. Our gas
00:19:56 members are dropping like flies to the coronavirus and we got a big game coming up.
00:20:00 Lace up the basketball shoes your mom gave you and get down here to Orlando, Florida.
00:20:04 We need to beat these monsters. Lace them up, Ben, or you'll have to dribble again.
00:20:11 I don't believe that I don't believe Mickey took place in, I don't believe Mickey or any
00:20:18 other Disney characters took part in the battle against the monstars. Neither, they're not,
00:20:25 I don't remember the name from the movie. They certainly weren't in Charles Barkley
00:20:29 Shut Up and Jam Guy Den. I think you perhaps might be thinking of Who Framed Roger Rabbit,
00:20:36 which as we all know is the prequel to Space Jam, took place before the Disney apartheid
00:20:42 that saw all the Disney characters shunted off into the ghetto, which is why they don't
00:20:46 appear in Space Jam. I don't know. That's it. So where in the timeline, where in the
00:20:54 timeline of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Space Jam, Charles Barkley Shut Up and Jam Guy
00:20:59 Den? Could this voice, I don't know, probably, you know what? Write me a fucking, write me
00:21:05 a two and a half page short story about it at me on Twitter and I'll read it. Someone
00:21:12 explain this shit to me. It doesn't make any sense. Where's the historicity? Where's the
00:21:17 verisimilitude? Next up, Ben S. Who could this be? Let's find out.
00:21:26 Listen here, Ben, Saint. Facts don't care about your feelings. But I do. How you doing, man?
00:21:35 How's it going, how's it going? Hope you're doing well.
00:21:43 Yeah, thanks. I'm just mad on Twitter, man. Just mad on Twitter at people like you.
00:21:52 Okay, great. Next one is from, wait, they listen, this was Simon's I Don't Like Salad. After
00:21:59 all these fucking salad posts. Everyone fucking salad posting in the voicemail this week. What
00:22:05 is some kind of virus? It's as though some kind of virus we're spreading among people
00:22:12 that makes them think about salad or something. I'm not sure what to make of it. Next one
00:22:20 is called Yeah. You know, there's something reassuring about the fact that Nate will most
00:22:27 likely, likely die before you. Knowing that he will have to face his death in his own cowardly
00:22:33 pathetic way. I do, I do. A truly sense of curse of curry.
00:22:40 Who's going to die? Did you say Nate was going to die? Did you say Iowa? Speak up.
00:22:49 Your message was muddled. Terrible. Bad, bad job. Next one, your eating preferences.
00:23:00 Alright, you fucks. Do you prefer eating salad on a plate or in a bowl? And double question.
00:23:11 When you're eating salad, do you prefer a fork with long prongs or short prongs? We
00:23:18 need to know. Um, all my forks have the same prong length. I never think about prong length.
00:23:29 I don't know. I have no idea. Um, who the fuck would eat salad on a plate? I guess like
00:23:37 that's awful. Imagine trying to eat salad on a plate. I, I don't have bowls big enough
00:23:43 to make salads that, that do it for me. Like I, the biggest bowls that I have are these
00:23:50 like, kind of, they're sort of like long-ish bowls, like you might serve soup in. And like
00:23:56 they just don't hold that much salad. So when I make a salad, which I do a lot lately,
00:24:01 um, just, just spring mix, Caesar dressing, grated Parmesan cheese, baby. No, I don't
00:24:12 even mix it in a bowl. I mix it in like the biggest tupperware I have. Like a big, maybe
00:24:16 like, you know, I have a big, I don't know how big it is. It's like maybe like nine inches
00:24:22 by nine inches square and kind of deep. I don't know. It's, it's, I mix it in that because
00:24:27 I just need the biggest vessel because I need to fucking mix it all. I need to mix all the
00:24:30 leaves up because they're not packed that tightly. I have to, I have to toss them around.
00:24:33 You got to toss them around. And if the bowl isn't big, if there's not excess volume, they're
00:24:37 going to fucking come out the sides and I have to clean it up. And that's stupid. No, no,
00:24:41 no, no, no. Big bowl, deep bowl, no plate. Give me a, give me a freaking break. Why don't
00:24:48 you? Um, next one, weird Al Yankovic. Hmm. Although they spelled it Yankovic, but whatever.
00:24:58 All right. What's, what's up? Hey, it's me. Weird Al Yankovic. And I got a pirate lead
00:25:03 from Ben's song from the last episode. It sounds just like him. I believe in the Quran and the
00:25:10 people of Iran. Please join us. Okay. Thanks for, thanks for parodying my dream song to make
00:25:21 out Islam. That's, it's, it's pretty edgy. That's pretty edgy for compared to your usual content.
00:25:30 Mr. Weird Al Sir. But I, you got to take chances sometimes. You know what? You got to speak truth
00:25:38 to power. Appreciate it. Next one. They listened to Why Munchy Why. So we're, we're there. We've
00:25:45 arrived. The last one that was skipped over last time was called left. Actually, I think
00:25:50 maybe that this one was not posted by the time last episode was, but we skipped it and
00:25:55 thought we did and didn't read it. So I'm going to read it anyway. It's called leftism
00:25:58 in my PCP returns probably a week late again. So let's hear that. Yeah, this is the guy
00:26:05 that left the voicemail where I not so subtly through shade at Nate because I think he needs
00:26:12 to read another book. Right. I still think that, but I want to apologize because I left that
00:26:18 expecting Nate to not be there to defend himself and that's, that's not cool. And also
00:26:25 I am clarifying that I was talking about the conversation that Ben and Digi were having
00:26:32 on the episode where they were together before Gib came in and not the episode where Ben was
00:26:38 just rambling on his own because I don't think Ben talked about politics when he was just
00:26:43 by himself. Not really. I'm not going to go back and double check that though. So maybe
00:26:51 I'm wrong. I don't know. Thanks for everything. All you guys do, including the ones that I
00:26:56 not so subtly make fun of. Yeah. I shit. I don't remember. Right. This person wrote
00:27:06 in or called in another voicemail called leftism in my PCP. And I'm sorry to say, but I don't
00:27:11 remember off the top of my head what you said in that one about Nate or anything else for
00:27:15 that matter. But if, but if, oh wait, I see it. I'm not going to listen to it. Whatever.
00:27:22 Maybe you, the viewer, remember that voicemail and you can draw in for some context and glean
00:27:28 something about what this person's intended message. As for me, I'm too stupid and that's
00:27:35 going to do it for this extra special edition of PCP extra credits. Ben listens to every
00:27:44 voicemail in protest. Um, that's so the next time, the next time you fat cats, the next
00:27:52 time you fucking bourgeois PCP members want to go and, and, and, you know, ruin, destroy
00:27:59 post office, you know, a gerrymander against, against, uh, against voicemail on a gerrymander,
00:28:05 the voicemails want to do some voter suppression against our beautiful Colin, Colin fans. I'm
00:28:12 here then saying the people's champion to lift up the marginalized, downtrodden, disenfranchised
00:28:21 PCP listeners, um, so that everyone can make fun of them and their shitty voicemails equally.
00:28:30 Thank you for listening. Good day, sir. And madam.
