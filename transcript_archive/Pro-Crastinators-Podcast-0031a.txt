00:00:00 I'm this far from the mic, and I'm this far from the mic.
00:00:25 I'm very close to my mic.
00:00:29 And I'm this far from the mic.
00:00:32 I'm here.
00:00:33 And we are...
00:00:35 These far as from the mic.
00:00:40 I actually said that the way Mumkey does at the end of all his let's plays, he always says,
00:00:45 And we're...
00:00:47 Yay!
00:00:49 I didn't hear it.
00:00:51 Hello everybody, and welcome to a new Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:54 This one's at 360 degrees.
00:00:56 I guess we should all look at the thing, right?
00:00:58 That's the audience in a while.
00:01:00 I see that my zoom is right in front of my face here.
00:01:04 Oh, I'll try to adjust it a little bit.
00:01:06 Yeah, let's see what we can do here.
00:01:08 Ben, despite what he may say, Ben doesn't enjoy a ride in his face every once in a while.
00:01:14 Alright, maybe like this.
00:01:16 I don't know what to do. What do you want from me?
00:01:18 No, Ben, you're visible. Yeah, you're good.
00:01:20 Okay, but now it's completely mitigated the benefits of it being on a switch.
00:01:24 Benefits.
00:01:25 Look, audience, you've never seen a 360 video before.
00:01:28 Click the screen with the mouse dragging around or use the lesson key.
00:01:33 And look around and watch us like you're really there.
00:01:37 Why don't you just hand them some fucking training wheels while you're at it?
00:01:41 These fucking simpletons.
00:01:43 We can't figure out what the giant fucking arrows on both sides of the screen mean.
00:01:49 Alright, we don't have a topic, but we have a 360 degree video.
00:01:55 That's what it's really meant.
00:01:57 We've got visuals instead of a topic, which is even better.
00:02:00 Yeah, it's a splash over substance. Everyone knows it's the best way to go.
00:02:05 That's what I'm known for, I think.
00:02:07 Yeah, something like that.
00:02:09 We've got Victor playing Bloodborne.
00:02:11 To represent what the audience should be doing when watching the CBC.
00:02:16 That is an impressive shot.
00:02:18 If you move the camera, you can look at what we're talking about hopefully.
00:02:21 This is a podcast and a list.
00:02:23 We all decided Victor's game was more interesting than each other.
00:02:28 The idea here was to have the ideal viewer being demonstrated for the audience to observe.
00:02:35 This is what you should be doing when listening to PCP.
00:02:38 You should be on a game playing Bloodborne specifically.
00:02:41 Two questions. One, should this just be a multi-topic general PCP
00:02:45 where we go through whatever we feel like talking about?
00:02:48 We're trying to decide on a topic for like an hour now.
00:02:51 We can't do it, so we should give up.
00:02:53 Should this become a...
00:02:56 Jesse gets up with that microphone and cuts an epic promo on all the things making him mad in 360.
00:03:02 Well, maybe.
00:03:04 Jesse is no more. You can call me microphone Jones.
00:03:08 I have no true identity.
00:03:10 No one can see my true visage.
00:03:13 I thought for sure you were going to say you were broken.
00:03:15 Broken Jesse, yeah.
00:03:18 I like microphone Jones better anyway.
00:03:21 Microphone Jones.
00:03:23 Microphone Jones has put one facet of the vessel that is now called broken Jesse.
00:03:28 It's very great that he's wrapped up in a winged approved blanket.
00:03:33 That's very interesting.
00:03:35 I don't know which fucking knot it is on that thing.
00:03:37 I've seen it somewhere.
00:03:38 Well, Jesse's closer. He should do it.
00:03:40 But his nose is like an all-new level if I do say so myself.
00:03:45 That is...
00:03:47 Oh, God.
00:03:48 It looks okay from the front, but that doesn't look okay at all.
00:03:52 You know, 360 videos are cool because they're like turning videos into video games, basically.
00:03:57 Yeah.
00:03:58 It's crazy to watch them.
00:04:00 I use this point extensively in my video thoughts on 360 videos.
00:04:04 The first time I watched a 360 video, I'm like, I'm in a Valve game, you know?
00:04:09 Yeah.
00:04:11 Well, we complain about that. Well, I complain about that.
00:04:14 Is now the time to hear our grievances about Portal 2?
00:04:17 Long last? No.
00:04:18 Whoa, we never did that one.
00:04:20 We have grievances about Portal 2?
00:04:21 We never did the Portal 2.
00:04:22 Some, yes.
00:04:23 I mean, there was a heated debate over whether Portal 2 was as good as Portal 1.
00:04:27 Portal 2 is better than Portal 2.
00:04:28 No, my friend.
00:04:30 I say Portal 1 and Portal 2 are like completely just as good.
00:04:34 Not even close.
00:04:35 Portal 1, Portal 2 has more stuff and if the Portal 1 is more pure because it was the original.
00:04:39 And all about pure.
00:04:40 Let me air my long-standing grievance that I've never resolved that all of you don't
00:04:44 think that being original is worth more than being good, but it absolutely is.
00:04:48 Oh, that's a good topic.
00:04:50 You're already kind of resolved that one.
00:04:52 I think we kind of agree, you and I, a bit on that.
00:04:56 No, I'm the only one.
00:04:57 No, because like...
00:04:58 I'm the only one who's pure.
00:04:59 Oh, okay.
00:05:00 Oh, wait, maybe we did.
00:05:01 I mean, we did argue about that, things we can't get into.
00:05:05 How is Portal 2 not original?
00:05:07 She turns into a fucking potato, you dolt.
00:05:09 It's because it's Portal 2.
00:05:11 You know what?
00:05:12 Think about it, think about it.
00:05:13 I'm too aggressive of a note.
00:05:14 Yeah.
00:05:15 We're not adults.
00:05:16 Okay, how about this?
00:05:17 I take it back.
00:05:18 Originality has more value than...
00:05:19 He's like a good gentleman.
00:05:20 He's a nice guy.
00:05:21 Yeah.
00:05:22 All right, let's check it out.
00:05:24 Originality has more value per pound than references and callbacks and like cultural appropriation.
00:05:30 Let's say that.
00:05:31 Wow, I could totally agree with that.
00:05:33 Yeah, but I think that appropriation references, remixes are like more easy to come by.
00:05:38 And therefore they comprise more of a diet.
00:05:41 I felt like last time this came up, no one even acknowledged to me that originality had inherent value in that.
00:05:48 No, we did.
00:05:49 I said that.
00:05:50 That's not how I remember it.
00:05:51 I said it has inherent value, but also that like if the next thing that comes along iterates on it and makes it a better version.
00:05:58 Yeah, and it's a better product.
00:05:59 If you stipulate that it's better, then sure, it's better.
00:06:02 Well, yeah.
00:06:03 If you build on it and that makes your argument better.
00:06:07 It's now better.
00:06:08 I guess because...
00:06:09 I can agree that if it's better.
00:06:11 I just made a video recently that like has a lot of references to other things.
00:06:16 Some references are like really specific and I'm really glad about that.
00:06:19 Then some references are like kind of a general, like I'm referencing it through.
00:06:23 Wait, you talk about the one, the 20 minute one about action scenes.
00:06:26 No, no, I'm talking about...
00:06:27 We tried to watch it through that.
00:06:29 You don't understand what the fuck you were talking about.
00:06:30 Couldn't make it.
00:06:31 Couldn't make it.
00:06:32 It was very confusing.
00:06:33 My side channel is not really for consumption at all.
00:06:36 You're just going to walk around your own room now and you do Davugos to sound?
00:06:43 I don't know.
00:06:44 Anyway, like I was...
00:06:45 I'm talking about the Radcon trailer I made.
00:06:48 It's got some references to like specific things and it's got some references to like general tropes.
00:06:53 And it's got like one or two jokes in the night thing or like a regional that like don't come into place.
00:06:58 So they can just pay us to our conversations.
00:07:00 The audio is not going to work like that.
00:07:03 I don't know what you mean, dude.
00:07:04 It's a 360 video.
00:07:06 They turn it towards us.
00:07:07 No, unfortunately, I would love that.
00:07:11 Wouldn't it work that way?
00:07:12 That would be pretty cool.
00:07:13 If you only heard which direction.
00:07:15 I really wanted to become like a choose your own adventure style thing.
00:07:18 But the only problem is you can't do audio that way.
00:07:20 But like I want it to be that whichever direction you look in, it'll like continue the video.
00:07:25 Wait, wait, wait.
00:07:26 What were you saying?
00:07:27 Speaking of choose your own adventure, I want to give everyone a game to play.
00:07:31 Can you spot the hippo in the room?
00:07:34 He's around here somewhere.
00:07:36 No, not you people.
00:07:37 You guys know.
00:07:38 I'm talking about him.
00:07:39 Yeah, don't look.
00:07:40 He's ruining it.
00:07:42 He's around.
00:07:45 He's like a touch of the corner.
00:07:47 I don't know which way the camera starts.
00:07:49 The camera's in every direction.
00:07:51 Yeah, their view field does not see every direction.
00:07:54 It sees one direction until they change it.
00:07:56 That's my point.
00:07:57 I only see one direction.
00:07:58 One direction is the grand final.
00:08:01 We're talking about how Action Giraffe is the greatest original character of all time.
00:08:06 This is Hamony's my best friend and he has AIDS in that order before.
00:08:13 Wait, and here's another best friend, Hippocrite.
00:08:16 All of a sudden your sunglasses look is freaking me out.
00:08:19 Suddenly.
00:08:20 Well you're going to have to deal with it.
00:08:21 You're suddenly a creature to me and it feels real and it's like fucking me.
00:08:24 Do I remind anyone else of the channelers from Dark Souls?
00:08:27 Because that's what I'm going for.
00:08:28 What the fuck, no.
00:08:29 They have three sets of eyes, like you know.
00:08:31 Well you have a fourth.
00:08:32 I have like a fifth now I think.
00:08:34 One, two, three, four.
00:08:37 There's five here somewhere.
00:08:39 I really think there's another one.
00:08:40 Oh wow, there's another one layered behind the blue one.
00:08:42 Yeah, that's right.
00:08:43 I really think that Hippo and Action Giraffe need to meet and befriend TJ Henry Yoshi.
00:08:48 Oh my god.
00:08:49 Yeah, well can anyone really befriend a man of that low caliber?
00:08:52 There are also animals that wear sunglasses.
00:08:56 Well Hippo doesn't usually wear sunglasses.
00:08:59 Guys, watch on your 3D camera.
00:09:01 Watch the perfect spiral you can make with Hippo when you throw them.
00:09:05 Here he goes.
00:09:06 Some depictions show him with the shutter shades,
00:09:09 but others give him the visor that that character from Ace Attorney has.
00:09:12 Right, yeah.
00:09:13 Some theorize that that's what's meant to be going on there.
00:09:18 He's the greatest meme of our generation.
00:09:20 TJ Henry Yoshi.
00:09:24 It's cool that we have all this stuff set up and then it's potentially recording properly.
00:09:31 Yeah, well said.
00:09:32 Isn't that neat?
00:09:34 We could only pray.
00:09:35 Yeah, we could only pray and have like a thing to talk about.
00:09:39 Well let me resolve what I was saying a minute ago.
00:09:41 The point is, I think I was slightly more proud of the mostly original jokes
00:09:46 that kind of are like their own thing.
00:09:48 Slightly more than the references.
00:09:50 Absolutely.
00:09:51 Any reasonable person would be.
00:09:53 Yeah, but the references were more voluminous.
00:09:56 What are you talking about?
00:09:58 What references?
00:09:59 The trailer.
00:10:00 The newest trailer for Radcon.
00:10:02 Oh, I thought we were still talking about Portal.
00:10:05 No.
00:10:06 Now we get back into Portal, right?
00:10:08 With the fact that Portal 1 has this portaling.
00:10:12 And it's like, oh my gosh, why did I never...
00:10:14 Portal 1 is a fucking tech demo.
00:10:16 For the Masterpiece Game 2 budget.
00:10:19 Objectively false.
00:10:20 Objectively true.
00:10:21 It's perfect.
00:10:22 Here's my impression of Portal 1.
00:10:23 Oh, I'm a bunch of white rooms.
00:10:25 The end.
00:10:26 Wow.
00:10:27 What a fucking...
00:10:28 Portal 2 is a fucking case study in how to add extra bullshit that wastes your time
00:10:32 into a game.
00:10:33 Like levels?
00:10:34 Extra bullshit.
00:10:35 It is not all great.
00:10:37 Like a story.
00:10:38 Like the backstory to how GLaDOS got her voice was really a wonderful addition.
00:10:42 No, it's not.
00:10:43 It's cool.
00:10:44 Why is it not cool?
00:10:45 Because it's not cool.
00:10:46 You have to tell me why it is cool.
00:10:48 It doesn't work the other way around.
00:10:49 Your people are really...
00:10:50 You're getting on microphone Jones' bad side.
00:10:52 You don't want to know what kind of a temper microphone Jones has and you really need
00:10:56 him to go in.
00:10:57 When I first watched the Matthew Matosis video where he complained about that, I'm like,
00:11:00 okay, yeah, that's...
00:11:01 Don't pretend like I hold the thing that's...
00:11:03 This is the original opinion.
00:11:05 Shit.
00:11:06 Well, it's like...
00:11:07 It's one of those things where if you look at all the things that you've classified that
00:11:10 constitutes good storytelling, it's like, I guess it doesn't do them.
00:11:13 But when I was playing the game, I didn't mind.
00:11:15 It was just sort of like...
00:11:17 It's literally turning your brain off.
00:11:19 Mr. Jones, I want to defend Matthew Matosis, but he hasn't released a video in like a year,
00:11:24 so it's whatever.
00:11:25 You throw him out with a bath water.
00:11:26 Yeah, put him in the fucking garbage.
00:11:27 Yeah.
00:11:28 I have a defense, so by the way.
00:11:30 No, it doesn't.
00:11:31 One of the two things he said, which is that...
00:11:33 Oh yeah, sing it.
00:11:34 You can't.
00:11:35 No one can sing it.
00:11:36 My fucking defense!
00:11:37 You deserve to hear me sing it.
00:11:38 He said, GLaDOS was a real character.
00:11:40 Now he's a real character.
00:11:42 Well, thank you.
00:11:43 You've got feet, eyes, no ears, buddy.
00:11:46 That's the worst opinion I've ever heard.
00:11:49 What's the worst opinion?
00:11:50 GLaDOS was a meme character to begin with.
00:11:53 That's not true.
00:11:54 What was the depth of GLaDOS' character in the first game?
00:11:57 First of all, she's an AI.
00:12:01 She doesn't need a complex or deep motivation.
00:12:03 GLaDOS in the first game is very funny and very unique the first time you see it,
00:12:08 but then after you play the game once and you play it again, all the jokes are old.
00:12:12 Oh yeah, so what we needed was Portal 2 where they shove her in your face more.
00:12:16 Oh, that was so much better.
00:12:18 Now she has some emotional depth.
00:12:20 Now she's got a tragic backstory that we can all relate to.
00:12:24 It wasn't even tragic.
00:12:25 Her backstory has nothing to do with the person that she was made by.
00:12:28 Well, you guys are just being a bunch of fucking snobs and cynics.
00:12:30 Of course it's better that she had a tragic dog.
00:12:32 That's not a real criticism.
00:12:33 You're just saying shit because it sounds cool.
00:12:35 She's way less compelling this way than she was as just a rogue AI.
00:12:38 What the fuck are you talking about?
00:12:39 Who's really compelling about a fucking AI?
00:12:41 There is some kind of wicked compelling because I was fucking compelled when I played Portal 2.
00:12:45 I was born with Portal 2 which is better than the greatest game of all time.
00:12:49 Wow.
00:12:50 I've never played any of the Portal games.
00:12:52 I'm not joking.
00:12:54 Get out of here Donnie bro.
00:12:56 Half-Life 3 is my favorite Portal game.
00:12:59 Now, to stop talking about superficial elements like story, I have a level design.
00:13:04 I hope that doesn't mean.
00:13:05 There's more levels in Portal 2.
00:13:06 The levels are more intricate in Portal 2.
00:13:08 And they have more depth.
00:13:09 There's more depth.
00:13:10 The levels are bigger and there's more going on.
00:13:12 There's more depth.
00:13:13 Bigger doesn't mean better.
00:13:15 In Portal 1.
00:13:16 But deeper does mean better.
00:13:17 And it's not deeper.
00:13:18 Here's what it is.
00:13:19 Some of them are deeper.
00:13:20 The first time I played Portal 1, I was like, this, I was like, I can't believe it.
00:13:25 All my life I've seen cartoons where people go through portals but it's just a bunch of blue swirls.
00:13:29 This has the idea that you can see what's going through the portal when you're seeing it.
00:13:32 That's so revolutionary.
00:13:33 Every show that has Portal is now sucked in comparison.
00:13:36 But you only got that traditional revelation.
00:13:38 Here's what it is.
00:13:40 When I first played Portal 1, I thought this game is genius.
00:13:44 But then when I played Portal 2, I thought I am a genius for beating these incredible levels.
00:13:52 The puzzles were literally harder in Portal 1.
00:13:54 Yeah.
00:13:55 The puzzles were so deep and had so much to do and they were so multi-layered that I really got a lot of satisfaction.
00:14:02 There was so much easier in Portal 2.
00:14:04 I didn't get as much out of that aspect of it.
00:14:06 I don't know what you're talking about.
00:14:08 When watching other people play it, there were like many puzzles.
00:14:10 The first one I was super stuck on.
00:14:12 When you see someone else play a game that you've played or you see Person A and you see Person B play it,
00:14:18 and you see how they're better or worse at different parts, Portal 2 for me was the ultimate experience of that.
00:14:22 Because I played it and I saw like two different or three different people play it.
00:14:25 When I first played Portal 1, I really felt like it was not good and it didn't get good until Portal 2.
00:14:30 You're lying.
00:14:31 You're telling me lies.
00:14:32 What the fuck?
00:14:33 I don't believe you.
00:14:34 That's all you really want to say.
00:14:35 Portal 1 is a boring two-hour piece of shit.
00:14:37 All you do is solve the same puzzle over and over again in the same room over and over again.
00:14:41 Portal 2 has a story, it has levels, it has better everything.
00:14:44 You're out of line, Microphone Jones.
00:14:46 I can't take you seriously anymore, Microphone Jones.
00:14:48 Microphone Jones is unleashed and out of control.
00:14:52 You know what? I think, you know, I said that I thought you were both the same.
00:14:55 The only argument you really need is that Portal 2 is objectively deeper.
00:15:00 There's literally more mechanics.
00:15:02 You literally go deeper into the game.
00:15:04 Right, okay, but that's the thing though.
00:15:05 It less thoroughly explores each of those mechanics than Portal 1 does.
00:15:09 Therefore, it is a less perfect version of the video games.
00:15:14 I played through Portal 2 in the...
00:15:16 I played through Portal 2 Co-op and Portal 2 Co-op.
00:15:20 Portal 2 Co-op's great.
00:15:21 Portal 2 Co-op has an entirely new dimension which is that there's four active portals at once
00:15:26 and they've got all the new mechanics with all the different kinds of goods.
00:15:29 It's amazing.
00:15:30 Oh, and by the way, custom levels.
00:15:32 Yo, I made a custom level.
00:15:35 I love the one custom level I made in Portal 2.
00:15:39 I was back when we started...
00:15:41 Did you see this earlier?
00:15:42 Yeah, I know.
00:15:43 Well, how the heck else am I supposed to get everyone's attention?
00:15:45 They're back when we started talking.
00:15:46 You just go, hey!
00:15:47 Boom.
00:15:48 And then you start talking.
00:15:49 Okay.
00:15:50 Well, here's the thing.
00:15:51 Portal...
00:15:52 I know, this is bad.
00:15:53 The central mechanic of Portal is the portals which is thoroughly...
00:15:58 In Portal 1, in Portal 2, they do all these extra additions around the portals which are
00:16:03 not as good.
00:16:04 Yeah, like a super good game of story.
00:16:06 And GLaDOS being way cooler.
00:16:08 Oh my god.
00:16:09 Oh, Bentley is so cool.
00:16:11 He's got the voice of characters that have heard of a million other places.
00:16:15 He doesn't even sound like a robot.
00:16:16 What a great idea for a character.
00:16:18 What the fuck are you talking about?
00:16:19 My point, he sounds like a human not a robot.
00:16:21 Can you, can you, Wheely?
00:16:22 Whatever, yeah.
00:16:23 What did I say?
00:16:24 Bentley Bear?
00:16:25 Bentley Farm for Bentley.
00:16:26 That's what I'm talking about.
00:16:27 That's what I'm talking about.
00:16:28 Yeah, that's right.
00:16:29 In Portal 1, the thing that makes GLaDOS great is that like, is the, is the, is just the
00:16:33 fact that she comes off like a, like a robot at first and you slowly realize how many like
00:16:37 weird personality traits she has.
00:16:39 That's what makes her funny and awesome.
00:16:41 I guess so.
00:16:42 She's pretty consistent though.
00:16:43 Okay, let's agree to disagree on Portal 1.
00:16:45 Talk about how shitty Bloodborne is because I genuinely hate this game and it's high times
00:16:49 when I'm not going to play this game.
00:16:50 No, man.
00:16:51 Bloodborne's a good shame.
00:16:52 We'll possibly say negatively about this game.
00:16:53 Then he can't beat the final boss.
00:16:55 That would be a big problem with the game, right?
00:16:56 Oh, and that color palette is too consistent.
00:16:59 That's my biggest complaint.
00:17:01 You've fought Garmin like four times anyway.
00:17:03 I fought him twice and I fucking got tired.
00:17:05 Well, whose problem is that?
00:17:07 That sounds like a personal issue.
00:17:09 No, you know why this game is fucking annoying?
00:17:11 Why?
00:17:12 Okay, it's designed to be hard, which is fine.
00:17:14 All the Souls games are designed to be hard.
00:17:16 But in all the Souls games, you don't have to fucking grind for 20 minutes every time you
00:17:19 die.
00:17:20 You get more fucking Bloodborne.
00:17:21 You actually do have to do that.
00:17:22 This game is a piece of shit.
00:17:25 Remember when you were a promising young man and you made a Demon Souls review, which
00:17:28 has the exact same need to grind in it, but you beat that game.
00:17:31 You don't need to grind in Demon Souls.
00:17:33 You fucking ruined it.
00:17:34 You have to grind in your fucking world on one.
00:17:36 You have to do it.
00:17:37 You're a supering child.
00:17:38 You peasant.
00:17:39 You fucking brother.
00:17:41 You are only mule.
00:17:43 Yeah, you are absolutely mule.
00:17:45 Absolute mule.
00:17:46 Absolute.
00:17:47 Yes.
00:17:48 I'm going to delete you, Jesse.
00:17:50 What I did was I just grinded it up like 150 vials at the beginning and then never had
00:17:55 to do it again.
00:17:56 I really am surprised by that because I had to farm many times.
00:17:58 What's the problem with grinding when just playing the game normally is awesome.
00:18:01 You could just be running around in a circle, killing the same enemy over and over again,
00:18:05 having the time of your life.
00:18:06 It's an amazing game.
00:18:07 How can you look at this game and not think it's amazing?
00:18:10 It's like shit to the game.
00:18:12 It's like a game like an arc, like a Final Fantasy.
00:18:14 Grinding is fun because you level up in your stat scope and you're always dealing slightly
00:18:17 more damage.
00:18:18 That's not how it is in Bloodborne where you do literally the same thing over and over
00:18:21 again.
00:18:22 So the grinding is less fun in Bloodborne for me?
00:18:24 Completely.
00:18:25 And I'm a grinding connoisseur.
00:18:26 Because pressing the R button is the most fun thing in the entire world of gaming in
00:18:30 Bloodborne.
00:18:31 And you know, I got to say, if I had to name, if you asked me like top 10 moments in all
00:18:36 video gaming, I would say pressing the R2 button to completion in Bloodborne.
00:18:40 Dude, we should do completion.
00:18:42 I hear you laugh.
00:18:45 Two-handed.
00:18:46 Two-handed.
00:18:47 Hold R2 all the way.
00:18:48 Oh yeah, that's how you call it.
00:18:49 And then ka-ching!
00:18:50 But blam!
00:18:51 Most satisfying moment in video gaming history.
00:18:53 Yeah, that's how you, you call it two-handing.
00:18:54 And me and my brother always call it double fisting.
00:18:56 That's the only term I use for fisting.
00:18:59 Yeah, I'm still, I'm still thinking about it.
00:19:01 It's like, okay.
00:19:02 No, I don't know.
00:19:03 I don't want to talk about video games.
00:19:05 I hate all of them.
00:19:06 I don't care about Portal.
00:19:08 Man, no.
00:19:09 Let's talk about the video games.
00:19:10 Let's talk about the video games.
00:19:11 Nobody likes us because we're a bunch of gamer boys.
00:19:14 They like us because we're a bunch of psychotic, imbecilic, idiot assholes
00:19:18 who scream at each other about fucking how big our wings are.
00:19:23 That's true.
00:19:24 My ween.
00:19:25 Are you guys seeing my ween?
00:19:26 Oh wait, wait, guys.
00:19:27 Check out my new shoes.
00:19:28 Check out these new shoes, dawg.
00:19:30 Look at these suede shoes.
00:19:32 Brown sand shoes.
00:19:33 From every angle.
00:19:34 This is just the everybody attempts at another topic
00:19:36 and gets shut down by everyone else's podcast.
00:19:38 Let's talk about shoes and how cool they are.
00:19:40 They are cool.
00:19:41 They are cool.
00:19:42 They are cool.
00:19:43 All right.
00:19:44 We can agree on that.
00:19:45 Ask Nate about his shoes and he'll tuck your dick too.
00:19:49 I'll tell you.
00:19:50 I'll suck your dick.
00:19:51 I wore these flip-flops sitting in the Philippines.
00:19:54 Wow.
00:19:55 They're all really issues.
00:19:56 They are falling apart.
00:19:57 You should be the main man in a bed like that.
00:20:00 I thought you shared fun all the time.
00:20:02 But life doesn't always work out the way it should.
00:20:06 I need to be conscious of the fact that whoever's listening to this
00:20:09 is only listening to one audio track.
00:20:11 Because Jesse certainly won't.
00:20:13 Neither will I.
00:20:14 I don't listen to any of our podcasts.
00:20:16 I unsubscribed from the Procrastination the other day.
00:20:18 I can't blame you.
00:20:20 I've had any secure with all of these goons.
00:20:23 Time to move on.
00:20:25 But unfortunately I moved on in the direction of his house.
00:20:28 Wait.
00:20:29 I take back that.
00:20:30 Why would anyone be subscribed?
00:20:32 Because I hate that shitty meme.
00:20:34 And nobody should say shit.
00:20:35 Hey, wait.
00:20:36 Let's talk about the sweet PCP trailers that have been coming out.
00:20:39 Yeah.
00:20:40 Let's talk about...
00:20:41 First there was the Kaon opening.
00:20:43 Oh, yeah.
00:20:44 And then there was the Davoo...
00:20:46 It was the Davoo PCP...
00:20:48 The Red Count Trailer.
00:20:49 The Red Count Trailer.
00:20:50 They...
00:20:51 I don't know.
00:20:52 They bloomed large in my personal consciousness.
00:20:54 Do you remember the person who made the Kaon ones?
00:20:56 So we can shout them out and tell them how cool they are?
00:20:59 I forget their name.
00:21:00 His name was Endless Jack.
00:21:02 It was the coming YouTube hero.
00:21:05 Hey, it's the Gibbo.
00:21:07 Gibbo, while you've been walking around, have you been saying anything?
00:21:10 Uh...
00:21:11 Yeah.
00:21:12 Your audio is still going on in our audio, right?
00:21:16 I don't know what you mean.
00:21:18 Also, your laptop...
00:21:20 Is it recording even?
00:21:21 Disconcerted.
00:21:22 Okay, well, whatever.
00:21:24 It's going to be God's word.
00:21:26 We have no idea what moments might have just...
00:21:29 You know what's been captured, budget?
00:21:31 Ha ha ha ha.
00:21:33 Like, in the background of the audio.
00:21:35 Not in the background of the audio.
00:21:37 Overpowering the rest of us.
00:21:39 That's probably the way it should be.
00:21:41 It's probably for the best.
00:21:42 It's a secret.
00:21:43 To everybody.
00:21:44 I have a suggestion to give to all the camera-designing people.
00:21:47 Because I was thinking, the next level after this is a podcast where you hit arrow keys
00:21:51 to move the camera angle around.
00:21:53 But how could that be filmed?
00:21:54 Drums?
00:21:55 What?
00:21:56 360 Drums.
00:21:57 But that would only work with live footage.
00:21:58 Here's how you do it.
00:21:59 You know, strip lights in a theater that line the...
00:22:02 Imagine instead of a little light that you have on the steps.
00:22:05 Every light instead of being a light, it's a little lens.
00:22:08 That's how they film the matrix, the 3D scenes.
00:22:10 Yeah, something like that.
00:22:11 But it's like a stringy.
00:22:12 And you can tape it up along the wall and record your whole house simultaneously.
00:22:16 And use the lassoed here.
00:22:18 You say simultaneously really fucking weird.
00:22:21 That's like the 10th time I've noticed that.
00:22:23 Microphone!
00:22:24 You know that's a reference to the time cube, right?
00:22:28 The what in the whole thing?
00:22:30 Yeah, that's right.
00:22:31 The time cube guy.
00:22:32 Yeah.
00:22:33 How can a box have six sides when it's the front, the back, the left, and the right?
00:22:39 Those are the sides.
00:22:40 How can you get off the bottom on the sides?
00:22:42 Is this one of those memes that you guys have?
00:22:45 You said before, the first stage is fewer than a quarter of a minute video.
00:22:49 No, time cube is fewer.
00:22:51 Also, time cube...
00:22:52 Also, this proves God, because God, you know, in some places he's just one guy.
00:22:56 But in some times he's three.
00:22:57 He's three in one.
00:22:58 That's not four.
00:22:59 You know, it's only three.
00:23:00 The time cube is this old psychopath who was on G4 in like 2005, and he was explaining
00:23:08 the time cube that the Earth is broken up into four quadrants, and each one is actually
00:23:14 experiencing the same time, but it's a difference.
00:23:18 Yeah.
00:23:19 But it all happened simultaneously.
00:23:20 And he's got these shiny white fake teeth.
00:23:23 Are you talking straight guys?
00:23:24 No.
00:23:25 You guys actually watch this right now, and it would totally show up on the 360 video,
00:23:29 and they'd be able to watch the video.
00:23:31 Let's give it a try.
00:23:32 Let's experiment and do it.
00:23:33 We're going to progress the media.
00:23:34 Oh my God, is this going to become like a mystery science thing with us watching shit,
00:23:39 and that's a great idea.
00:23:40 I want that.
00:23:41 That would be so bad.
00:23:42 By the way, the K-On! opening was by Doon Coon.
00:23:45 Doon Coon.
00:23:46 Thanks, Doon.
00:23:47 Thanks for coming out.
00:23:48 This is going to be a podcast.
00:23:49 I'm going to get a reaction video all at once, because you can look around on it.
00:23:53 And it's a secret time cube.
00:23:55 Just start time cube, and it'll be the amount of time you give and take, I guess.
00:24:01 People, I apologize for this.
00:24:03 I apologize for me and for my friends.
00:24:05 We're all horrible.
00:24:06 But now we're going to watch better videos, and you can watch them with us, as opposed
00:24:10 to just watching us.
00:24:11 Don't watch them on your own computer.
00:24:12 No.
00:24:16 It's going to explode.
00:24:17 Simultaneously.
00:24:18 It's back on now.
00:24:19 All right.
00:24:20 So, watch the red lights.
00:24:22 Tell the mystery as to how much just got cut out, or how much you had to...
00:24:26 Some of that.
00:24:27 Do you think it filmed the time cube at all?
00:24:29 I hope so.
00:24:30 Who knows?
00:24:31 That would be the worst place to have not had the video.
00:24:33 Yeah.
00:24:34 Maybe we'll have to do another.
00:24:35 We'll have to do another like it.
00:24:36 Perhaps.
00:24:37 Well, we'll certainly have plenty of times.
00:24:40 I'm all for just filming, like, a million mystery science theater videos of us shitting
00:24:45 YouTube videos.
00:24:46 That's actually a great idea.
00:24:47 Yeah.
00:24:48 That's actually a better idea than the PCP.
00:24:49 We should get rid of the PCP.
00:24:51 And you're pleased with that.
00:24:55 Do you guys want to discuss anything?
00:24:57 I do want to hear the airplane.
00:24:59 Yeah, me too.
00:25:00 Yesterday, I was so fucking angry that I could have cut the greatest throw-mobile time,
00:25:05 but I was also too tired.
00:25:06 I didn't give a shit.
00:25:07 I didn't want to tell anyone anything.
00:25:09 Now, I have to like go back in time and try to reignite that spark.
00:25:13 It might help if you came out kind of in a security blanket.
00:25:16 You didn't see me for who I truly am.
00:25:19 I'm a sexy boy.
00:25:24 You should show off your fucking body and strut around this place with that fucking mic
00:25:28 that you can walk with.
00:25:29 That's true.
00:25:30 And this is the ultimate promo.
00:25:31 They can follow you.
00:25:32 Do it.
00:25:33 Do it.
00:25:34 Do it.
00:25:35 Although the mic port is not very long.
00:25:37 You're putting me under a lot of pressure right now.
00:25:39 I wish to know what happened at the fucking airport.
00:25:42 All it takes for me to get mad, to get re-mad, is to just start reciting what happened in
00:25:47 my mind, even if it was 10 years ago.
00:25:49 I want to know what the deal is with the guy who was stealing the fucking bananas.
00:25:52 I need to know what that guy did to cause this problem.
00:25:55 No, no, no.
00:25:56 I feel like he told us.
00:25:57 No, no, he didn't go into detail.
00:25:59 No, he refused to tell us so that he could tell us on camera.
00:26:02 He's had a total like a restaurant list going right now.
00:26:06 Let's do it.
00:26:09 People of the world, if you thought 9-11 was bad, you don't know about 9-12 yet.
00:26:18 September 12th, 2016, a day that shall live in infamy, a day that shall live on in the
00:26:26 nightmares of everyone in the world for the rest of time once I tell the story.
00:26:30 I don't actually feel like telling the story.
00:26:32 You know what?
00:26:33 Oh, come on.
00:26:34 Come on.
00:26:35 Now you got a solid answer for it.
00:26:37 I don't even remember what happened.
00:26:38 I fucking want to know.
00:26:39 You know.
00:26:40 You know.
00:26:41 I built this up so much.
00:26:43 The story is just going to be, I went to the airport and I got to miss my flight.
00:26:46 It was pretty poopy.
00:26:47 Yeah, but why'd you miss it though?
00:26:48 It was only like a 10 minute, the first flight was like a 10 minute flight, right?
00:26:52 Yeah, cause I couldn't find a bus.
00:26:56 What was it called?
00:26:57 Gun.
00:26:58 Car.
00:26:59 Plane.
00:27:00 Plane.
00:27:01 I give up.
00:27:02 I couldn't find a plane.
00:27:04 Well, okay.
00:27:05 One time I missed a flight because, so I get to the desk at CVG in, in Ohio or Kentucky
00:27:12 or whatever.
00:27:13 And the guy at the desk says, sir, your flight leaves in 50 minutes.
00:27:17 You have to be here an hour before your flight leaves or you can't go.
00:27:22 And I said, what?
00:27:24 And he's, no, he's like, this is policy.
00:27:26 And as I berated him for the next, about, it took 10 minutes of yelling at this man to
00:27:31 go.
00:27:32 I can make it.
00:27:33 It's right there.
00:27:34 I need to go now.
00:27:35 He said, he eventually like called people and they were like, okay, fine.
00:27:39 And they let me run.
00:27:40 Automatons.
00:27:41 And when I got there, they had just finished the boarding process and I was not allowed
00:27:46 on that flight costing me 24 hours of waiting time.
00:27:49 Worthless.
00:27:50 So that guy cost me that fucking flight.
00:27:52 Dragon their fear.
00:27:53 Yeah, that's right.
00:27:54 Coming up your date.
00:27:55 Whatever they can to be a fucking nuisance.
00:27:57 You know, everyone who knows me, everyone who knows me in my real life, they know that
00:28:00 I have like a psychotic physical aversion to bureaucracy or process of any kind.
00:28:07 I do everything I can to avoid it.
00:28:09 You know, anytime I get on a plane, I try not to pack too much.
00:28:14 I try to pack life specifically because I don't want to deal with like baggage claim
00:28:17 and all that ridiculous bullshit.
00:28:19 My dream in life, my one goal, my one aspiration is to someday get on a plane with no baggage.
00:28:24 To just travel with nothing but the clothes on my back and the sweat on my balls and no
00:28:28 other bullshit.
00:28:29 That's the dream.
00:28:31 So I packed my suitcase the other day before I go to this fucking airport.
00:28:35 I got a fucking flight to Chicago and then from Chicago flight to here because you can't
00:28:39 just come here.
00:28:40 They can't just do what I want.
00:28:41 No one can just do what I want.
00:28:43 Everyone has to get in my fucking way deliberately.
00:28:45 It's a conspiracy.
00:28:46 A global worldwide like driven conspiracy to make me miserable specifically.
00:28:52 So I packed my bag, the same bag that I've gone on a plane with like four other times.
00:28:57 I know for a fact it's a carry on bag.
00:28:59 I've carried it on multiple planes.
00:29:01 I've never had to go through baggage claim ever before.
00:29:04 So I get to the fucking airport place and I say, I'm here for my plane, cunt.
00:29:12 She says, oh thank God, Lord Jess has arrived to sample our automobiles of the sky and go
00:29:22 where we may.
00:29:24 So I take my little bag, she says little bag, she says little bag, take my little bag to
00:29:29 the plane.
00:29:30 I go through the fucking plane corridor and when I go to the plane, some fucking broad
00:29:35 takes my bag.
00:29:37 She just like jumps out of the woodwork like a monster in an haunted house and grabs my
00:29:41 bag and slaps the red sticker on it and takes it away.
00:29:45 And apparently this was like a valet thing because the plane was so fucking rinky dink
00:29:48 and small that there was no baggage spots in the, I've never fucking done the valet thing
00:29:53 before.
00:29:54 I've never even heard of it.
00:29:55 So she didn't explain it to me.
00:29:56 She just took my bag and I'm like, um, that you can't take that as a carry on.
00:29:59 What are you taking me to?
00:30:00 She's like, no, I'm taking it.
00:30:01 I'm like, okay, come on, just fucking taking it.
00:30:03 You can't fuck with these people.
00:30:05 So I just like, okay, I just have to allow these maniacs to take my fucking stuff.
00:30:12 And this is precious cargo.
00:30:14 You want to know what's in this bag, the precious cargo that I'm transporting.
00:30:18 More than anything.
00:30:19 First of all, I've got like four or five of my favorite shirts in there, which if any
00:30:23 one of them were to be lost, it would be a mass shooting by me.
00:30:26 It would be, it would be like 10, 9, 11s at once.
00:30:30 A lot of bullets.
00:30:32 Yeah.
00:30:33 A lot of bullets.
00:30:34 A lot of bullets.
00:30:35 Like in the World Trade Center.
00:30:36 I World War II by plane.
00:30:41 But um, so I have a bunch of shirts, my favorite shirts.
00:30:48 Shirts that I specifically picked out because like, you know, when I'm on camera at Casa
00:30:53 de Conran, I'm going to want the perfect wardrobe.
00:30:56 I got my Kelly Bundy shirt.
00:30:58 I got my Misado shirt.
00:31:00 All the best shirts.
00:31:01 And not only, not all my shirts, I got my laptop, which has my entire life on it.
00:31:06 All my stuff that I've read over like the last eight years, if that were to get lost.
00:31:12 Delete.
00:31:13 Delete.
00:31:14 Delete.
00:31:15 Delete.
00:31:16 Delete.
00:31:17 So I've got a bunch of my favorite shirts.
00:31:19 I got my fucking laptop.
00:31:20 And oh yeah, my best friend, Colt Corona, is in that fucking shirt case.
00:31:26 He, you know, he begged me to bring him along to let, to allow him to tag along in this
00:31:30 journey.
00:31:31 And I said, I said, brother Corona, I knew you'd come.
00:31:37 So I threw him in there.
00:31:40 So I've got basically the most precious cargo imaginable.
00:31:42 This fucking lady just jumps out of the bushes and takes my suitcase and tosses it into some
00:31:48 fucking plane.
00:31:49 Oh, I don't know.
00:31:50 The purest creature that ever lived.
00:31:51 Colt Corona.
00:31:52 Yeah.
00:31:53 The only one of us who deserves to be here.
00:31:57 So I get on this tiny fucking plane.
00:31:59 And of course my ticket has a seat number on it because God forbid anyone have any autonomy
00:32:04 in picking their own fucking seat.
00:32:06 We have to be treated like a bunch of kindergartners.
00:32:08 I think, in fact, I think even kindergartners would be allowed to pick their own seat and
00:32:12 clap.
00:32:13 Treat it like an obsolete mule.
00:32:14 Treat it like an obsolete mule.
00:32:15 Yeah, that's right.
00:32:16 Exactly.
00:32:17 Well, let me tell you about the obsolete mule that I met on the plane because that's exactly
00:32:20 what came up to me.
00:32:21 You know, I'm fucking looking at, I'm trying to decipher this fucking number because it
00:32:26 can't just be a seat number.
00:32:27 It's got to be like a letter and then a number.
00:32:29 And every seat has like three letters on it and four numbers and you've got to decipher
00:32:33 them.
00:32:34 So I go into the back of this cramped fucking rinky-dink, tiny-ass, ball sack plane and
00:32:38 I get into the back of it and I pick my seat and I'm like, okay, I fucking see it, I guess.
00:32:43 They're gonna fucking, they have to micromanage where we sit like a bunch of fucking sardines
00:32:47 in a can full of sardines.
00:32:49 So I'm sitting in my seat and this fucking guy comes up and he's like, I'm just eating
00:32:54 and I hate to bother you.
00:32:56 But is that a C-A-12?
00:32:59 I am, you're in my seat, you're in the good seat by this little smelly bitch over here.
00:33:05 You know, I hate to bother you like, shut up, you know, you love to bother me.
00:33:09 He's loving it, dude.
00:33:10 He's fucking fucked.
00:33:11 You goat Jesus.
00:33:15 You slut.
00:33:16 You aged slut from hell.
00:33:19 You know, he's fucking, he's taking so much joy in just being a smug guy and saying,
00:33:24 hey, believe you made an error in deciphering your ticket seat.
00:33:29 So, you know, he makes me get up and cross the aisle because it's so important to him
00:33:34 that he's sit where they tell him to sit.
00:33:37 You know, if only our politicians would take a leaf out of his book and encourage
00:33:40 cross the aisle.
00:33:41 You know what I'm saying, folks?
00:33:43 What the fuck are you?
00:33:44 That's a political expression.
00:33:45 I'm sorry.
00:33:46 I have no idea what that means.
00:33:48 It's a real thing.
00:33:49 Watch your madness.
00:33:50 Delete.
00:33:51 Delete.
00:33:52 Delete.
00:33:53 Delete.
00:33:54 Delete.
00:33:55 Delete.
00:33:56 Delete.
00:33:57 Yeah, delete.
00:33:59 Delete.
00:34:00 Delete.
00:34:01 That is a whole different meaning.
00:34:03 It's just as if it's mind-blowing that people care so much about the rules.
00:34:08 Like, I believe that if nobody gets hurt by you breaking a rule, you have a moral obligation
00:34:14 to break the rule.
00:34:15 You have a responsibility as a member of the free human race to break every rule that
00:34:21 won't hurt someone.
00:34:22 If you can get the same result by breaking a rule or not breaking it, you should definitely
00:34:27 break it because everyone else would not break it and that's lame.
00:34:30 It is lame.
00:34:31 That's true.
00:34:32 I think it's about, like, judicial precedent.
00:34:34 Like, well, the last guy broke the rule all the time.
00:34:37 Yeah, but you have to stop breaking the rule because now it's causing a problem.
00:34:40 You've got to be out there setting a new precedent.
00:34:42 That is true.
00:34:43 Yeah.
00:34:44 Then what happened?
00:34:45 I'm still on that fucking guy who gave me a guy on the seat.
00:34:48 It's not like there's some fucking, it's not like there's a bunch of knights patrolling
00:34:52 the plane, making sure everyone's in the right seat.
00:34:54 No one's going to give a shit.
00:34:55 Just let me fucking sit here.
00:34:57 Let me have the fucking window seat, you monster.
00:35:01 That's an evil fucking animal who would take me out of a window seat and put me in an aisle
00:35:05 seat.
00:35:06 I'll seats are the most miserable fucking thing.
00:35:08 Well, that's what I didn't want.
00:35:10 Well, I sat in it first.
00:35:12 That's all that should matter.
00:35:13 On my flight over here, I just, like, I just half the time, my face was pressed right
00:35:18 up against the glass.
00:35:19 That's the best part.
00:35:20 That's the only thing that matters in life.
00:35:23 The only good part of the entire airport experience is that brief moment when the plane takes
00:35:30 off and you get to look out the window and see this horrifying world get smaller.
00:35:34 It's the only thing I look forward to about the whole miserable experience.
00:35:38 And now I'm stuck in this aisle seat next to this smelly old broad who's like 60, but
00:35:43 like 160.
00:35:44 Yeah.
00:35:45 That's her age.
00:35:46 160 year olds on top of each other as one person.
00:35:49 And she's pulling out a fucking sandwich from a brown paper bag, like a fucking rube,
00:35:54 like some kind of kid in school.
00:35:56 And, you know, you can't even look out the window at all when you're in the aisle seat
00:36:00 because then you're also looking at the person.
00:36:02 Yeah.
00:36:03 So if she looks back and sees me looking at her, looking out the window, she's going to
00:36:07 think I'm in the aisle seat.
