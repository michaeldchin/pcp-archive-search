00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:12 Yeah, there you go. We always record a podcast. And if you think we won't, well, that is similar.
00:00:27 I'm the best guy ever. And Steven. Yeah, and Steven is here, aka Hippocrit.
00:00:36 I'm Pearl. It's me. I did it. Oh, by the way, I think we should mention Munchy is not here
00:00:44 because his voice is dead. Go watch the video, live and learn on Munchy's channel. You will
00:00:50 understand. Indeed. Please do. Please go watch that video.
00:00:54 Wait, shut up, everyone. Let me talk more about which crystal gem I am. I'm actually
00:00:59 amethyst, and let me give you a long, let me give you... Because you are a literal trash
00:01:04 eater and a garbage person. No, I'm amethyst because I have tender feelings and you just
00:01:09 shattered them. Yeah, that makes sense. Do people not like amethyst? I love amethyst.
00:01:15 Ben, did you not see the new Steven Volley? It was confirmed that amethyst is the most
00:01:19 emotionally mature. Amethyst is canon. It's canon. They said so. Well, I don't like her
00:01:26 as much anymore, but I used to like her. But Ben, she eats trash, so you know. Yeah, and
00:01:32 she's fat, like me. Yeah, I guess that's true. Ben's here. We're past that. Tom is here.
00:01:41 She likes horses. Ben. Oh, sorry. She is a horse. I'm here. There he is. I'm great.
00:01:48 I still like Peridot. Peridot's good. And Mage. Mage is here. It is I, the Mage. Mage
00:01:55 is like Garnet because she's a lesbian. I'm not a lesbian. I'm two little lesbians in
00:02:04 a trench coat. Yeah, that would make sense. That pretty much sums up Garnet right there.
00:02:09 Yeah, there's not much else going on there. I'd say I am like Ruby, who also is my favorite
00:02:15 of the Crystal Gems, because I'm a little Spitfire with a big attitude. Nate, are you
00:02:20 a part of me? What? Yes, you are my mother. You birthed me. It was a traumatic experience.
00:02:27 That's incorrect, and it's the opposite sort of. Garnet is sex. That is what she is. Garnet
00:02:34 is like if two kids gave birth to their own mom. You're right. That's true. This is the
00:02:45 quality Steven Universe discussion the internet's been missing. I love Steven Universe. I do like
00:02:52 Lapis Lazuli at least design-wise, but Garnet is my favorite. Lapis is best design. Seems like a lot
00:02:57 of sad girls really like Lapis Lazuli. Like broken women seem to really enjoy her. I wonder why
00:03:04 that could be. They might see to relate to in that character. You know what it is? I want to
00:03:09 criticize real quick everyone who likes relatable characters. Y'all are basic as fuck. You bore
00:03:14 me with your opinions on things. Well, I think that Amethyst is more aspirational than relatable
00:03:19 to me. Yeah, eating more trash. Even believe not just eating it, but living in it. You know,
00:03:27 much like Ben, I hated Amethyst intensely at first and still do. I actually warmed up to Amethyst
00:03:36 quite a bit. Amethyst was like the barrier to entry for anyone who saw Steven Universe because
00:03:46 she's like, oh, she's fat, she's sassy, and she's sort of kind of black. This is one of those
00:03:53 Tumblr shows. I don't know about this, but then you watch it and it's like, hey, you know what,
00:03:58 they're all cool. I like them. Amethyst became good. Well, okay, I can't remember when I started
00:04:03 to like it. It was sometime in season two. Maybe I'll resign that subscription to fucking Stormfront
00:04:10 after all. The main reason I like her is because she's purple. That's a good reason to like something.
00:04:17 Like her hair. Relatability? No. Color? Yes. The best thing about Amethyst by far was that time
00:04:24 that she met the other Amethysts and belonged for the first time. That was great. It was the most
00:04:30 endearing moment of hers by far by a huge margin. What the fuck was the name of the Amethyst and
00:04:36 Steven Fusion? Oh, Smoky Quartz. Smoky Quartz. That was a big fucking funny guy. It's a problem.
00:04:45 It's a problem that's real. Absolutely. I mean, we all agree it was hideous, right? Yes. Really
00:04:53 just unpleasant. That's the worst thing about it. That's the weird three arm thing. What is that
00:04:58 about? It's up. It's like it splits at the elbow and that bothers me. Yeah, it's really fucked up.
00:05:05 Don't you like Nika Robin, Nate? But Nika Robin is temporary only. Nika Robin is like
00:05:12 artistically symmetrical. She never does things in ones. Nika Robin is all about style. All about
00:05:18 style. Smoky Quartz has never even heard of the word Gucci, which is a serious problem. She lacks
00:05:24 style entirely. That's my main point. She is gross. She is very, very gross. I like the Yo-Yo
00:05:31 fight thing. Yeah, it was all right. It was okay. The episode where she appeared was kind of weird,
00:05:37 though. Is that the one where they fight orange in the quarry? And then there was a game show. There
00:05:43 was a game show in the next episode, which is very weird. Yeah, it was that one. It was the same
00:05:47 bomb. Different episode. Why can Steven fuse? It doesn't make any sense. The gems are made out of
00:05:54 hard light and he's made out of fucking flesh. Why can he fuse with fucking connet? It doesn't make
00:05:59 any sense either. I mean, no. That makes just as little sense. Yeah, even less, I'd argue. The
00:06:08 gems fusing makes perfect sense because they don't have physical bodies. I don't know. It bugs me
00:06:12 out that Steven confused the physical body. It actually makes zero sense. It makes 100% sense,
00:06:18 more or less, the gems confuse. And I would say it does make zero sense that Steven was especially
00:06:25 the molecules, I guess. But what about magic? Steven and Connie die in the moment because
00:06:34 their molecular structures change and then they revert once they infuse. Fusion is just like the
00:06:40 transporter in Star Trek. See the video by my favorite brony analyst, Night Sphere the Gnostic,
00:06:48 discussing why Twilight actually died when she became a princess because her body was destroyed
00:06:53 and an identical clone of her was reconstructed. Does this majorly interfere with his love of the
00:07:00 show or is it not a big deal? Of course not. Okay, well, that's good. They have teleporters in
00:07:09 Steven Universe and maybe they're always dying. Well, we see them move though. It feels like,
00:07:14 you know, they don't get deconstructed and reconstructed. They go through like a wormhole,
00:07:19 like two things or space because they get lifted up. You see them go whoosh. Yeah, you see them in
00:07:24 the like hyperspace continuum or whatever. And didn't the first time Steven goes through the
00:07:29 teleporter like they showed him like getting stretched out before they get to the next place?
00:07:34 So that's safe. That's that's that's existentially safe teleportation right there. I agree. I agree.
00:07:42 Thanks, Rebecca Sugar. I appreciate that. By the way, spoilers for Steven
00:07:50 Universe. Steven Universe season five, I think is officially over at this point. There was just a
00:07:55 Steven bomb, which is why we're here doing Steven Universe part two. Remember episode two of the
00:08:00 PCP more than two years ago. Episode three. It's back. It's back. No, oh, sorry. You're right. It
00:08:06 was episode three. I forgot. That was two years ago and like, more than that. Yeah, nothing's
00:08:10 happened. That's not true. But it's not enough. You know what? What was happening when we talked
00:08:17 and that actually is relevant. So what was happening when that happened was we were we were
00:08:22 going through the time it was like after Peridot had been redeemed. Yeah, that was like what just
00:08:27 happened. It was the end of that bomb. Yeah, I think that's right. I think that's right. And the
00:08:31 things that have happened since then, the cluster thing happened notoriously was kind of
00:08:36 unsatisfying. We like met the diamonds went went to the yeah went to homeworld went to homeworld
00:08:43 and now learned a lot about the diamonds. Yeah, the stars and all that. And that's really that's
00:08:48 really it. Connie Connie spent an entire bomb being broken up with Steven for reasons didn't
00:08:54 make any sense. Oh, I think she was on her period, guys. You know, that's probably what they were
00:09:00 going for. I liked it. You know, what was weird about that specifically is that she spent that
00:09:11 whole bomb like broken up with Steven, she comes back. And in this, this bomb, there's a big final
00:09:17 battle with the the the two yellow and blue diamond and Steven and Connie do not fuse once.
00:09:25 They don't get together to do a big cool thing. They just the soul breaks in Connie is there was
00:09:31 so much emphasis on Steve Vani recently. I can explain to you why this didn't happen. I think
00:09:38 it's because Steven Universe sets out to resolve all conflicts through talking and understanding
00:09:44 Stefani would be, you know, them fighting and most likely losing. I mean, I wouldn't have I
00:09:50 understand the talking part, but like they did have a lot of fighting and Stefani coming together
00:09:55 be like, Yeah, we're gonna fight and then they get hit apart or Steven gets knocked out or something.
00:09:59 And then Connie could have been they could have done something, but they just didn't.
00:10:05 So, so did you guys like the newest bomb? Yes. Yes, I did. Yes. Why this bomb was good. It was
00:10:13 good because it didn't fuck around. It was just like, they didn't have any bullshit for the most
00:10:18 part. It was just good. Yeah, the first one was really weak. The first episode I like grown the
00:10:25 whole way through. Wait, which one was the first episode? The amethyst and Steven looking for Ruby.
00:10:31 I completely forget that. No, you just referenced it when you said that she's the most mature one.
00:10:38 Oh, yeah, they made that conclusion. I didn't think that was a way that was character development.
00:10:44 It's fine. Wait, what did we learn about amethyst that she doesn't think that Rose's problems are
00:10:51 her fault? I don't know. That doesn't seem like a premise for the entire episode. I think the
00:10:54 interesting thing about that episode was that like, like, like for the entire show, like everyone
00:11:00 has like been dumping their shit on Steven. And like, Steven's been like the character that like
00:11:06 interjects and becomes like the focal point of like the problems, like like Pearl's problems
00:11:11 be ends up Steven's problems, Garnet's problems end up Steven's problems, even Ruby and Sapphire's
00:11:15 problems are now Steven's problems. That's the whole point of the episode. But like this entire
00:11:18 time amethyst has all the shit that she's going through. And the point of the episode is that I'm
00:11:22 not going to dump this on you. This is my burden. I'm going to, you know, you already have enough
00:11:27 shit going on. I'm not going to give you more shit to deal with. I'm just going to like,
00:11:33 you know, suffer in silence and keep it to myself and not put that on you as well. And that was
00:11:37 the point and it was good character moment. I don't want to say like, I think the idea and the
00:11:44 message and what they did is really good. I liked it. I liked the concept, but the execution of it
00:11:50 within that episode is what I decided. It was just kind of slow. It was just felt kind of slow and
00:11:57 patted out. Well, it did feel a little patted out. I could tell this was like part of the beginning
00:12:03 of the Steven bomb, but they needed to like have each part of the Steven bomb be an episode's length.
00:12:10 And so, you know, they couldn't have half of the next cowboy episode in the first episode,
00:12:14 even if it would make more time, makes more sense. Like they have to be their own self-contained
00:12:20 episodes, despite being released in a bomb format for some reason. But yeah, it was slow. I did
00:12:28 kind of like how Steven didn't really know how to react to it though. It was just like even the
00:12:32 pizza and it was like- You know what? You guys were actually wrong. It was the second episode of
00:12:35 the bomb. Yeah, the first episode is where they find out about Pink and Garnet unfuses. That was
00:12:41 the one that I was okay because that one starts off and it's like, now let's all talk and discuss
00:12:47 and deal with the fallout of this massive revelation that Rose Quartz is Pink Diamond. And I rolled
00:12:51 my eyes and was like, oh god, I don't want to. I don't want to see this. It's the same episode.
00:12:56 No, I'm looking. It's there too. There's two episodes. The first one is now we're only falling
00:13:00 apart. And that's about they tell Sapphire the story of how- Oh, you're right. They tell Sapphire
00:13:06 the incredibly tedious story of how Pink Diamond becomes Rose Quartz. And then the second one is-
00:13:11 It was super tedious. And it was so bloated and weird.
00:13:14 Okay, it's the second episode. Right. Okay, the first episode. Forgettable, obviously.
00:13:19 Well, whatever. It was insane. It wasn't too bad though. I mean, it was-
00:13:22 Oh, yes, it was. Let's- I didn't have a huge problem with it. I think the problem is that
00:13:27 most of it, most of that stuff we already knew as the audience just threw like infer-
00:13:31 Yeah, it felt like a recap episode maybe. It felt like a recap episode and like the
00:13:36 I don't know. I get that the characters would be stunned by this revelation, but I'm already over
00:13:41 it, so I don't care. Well, that's because this show has like huge gaps in between it. Like,
00:13:45 if this was a normal show, like we would have only found out last week and it would have-
00:13:49 I don't think that's the reason because I did not find the reveal that Rose Quartz was Pink
00:13:53 Diamond to be surprising or interesting. Well, we haven't talked about that.
00:13:57 To go back to that for a second too, like- Yeah, that's a good one.
00:14:00 This bomb was good, but like the last time we talked about Steven Universe was way the
00:14:03 fuck before. I think the fact that we went on this whole fucking like year-long side quest of like,
00:14:10 no, Rose and Pink aren't the same, even though that was like the assumption for a while,
00:14:14 and then they went so far out of their way just to be like a U-turn of like, actually it was
00:14:19 exactly what everybody thought the whole time. That was a whole waste of time. That was like a
00:14:22 waste of a year. It's profoundly unsatisfying to have the- like everyone had all these theories
00:14:27 and then they really worked hard to fight against our expectations that that would be true and
00:14:32 then it just was true and here we are. Yeah, so obvious and I was like, oh, yeah, it was dumb.
00:14:40 I didn't- I didn't like that. We made you think you were wrong. Yeah, I was right. Did we not say-
00:14:45 Oh yeah, go on. Yeah, I was- I was wondering about this when it happened. I was like,
00:14:50 why is this not satisfying? Why is this not interesting? Because like,
00:14:54 it's- it's not like- I've already blown my load over Rose being Pink like three years ago and-
00:15:00 Well, I didn't- I didn't like know like the fan theories or like piece that together.
00:15:06 So it was like a surprise, but I still wasn't that interested because all it meant was that Rose's
00:15:12 mom- I mean, Stephen says this in this current- in like episode two when he's talking down with
00:15:16 this in the pizza shop. He's like, well now my mom didn't kill Pink Diamond, so she's not complex
00:15:22 a character. She's now like less complex a character and I don't know how to feel about that and
00:15:31 Stephen says, yeah, I don't know how to feel about that and like, yeah, this is stupid. But now I'm
00:15:35 just in like- in a weird like side step. Oh, now she just like is a liar, so let's like lump in those
00:15:40 weird mixed emotions here and we'll have to like sort it out. What am I supposed to be mad at Rose
00:15:45 about again? It feels like an asshole because like there's like- it just seems like, oh, if she's
00:15:49 like one of the three most powerful people, she couldn't find a way to deal with this without
00:15:53 like starting a war against herself. It just seems- well, well, the other two are like definitely
00:15:59 stronger than her. Like sure, but it seems weak. It seems weak to me. I agree Tom, that it does seem
00:16:04 weak. The excuse they gave was essentially she tried to reason with them and they simply would
00:16:09 not even meet her any of the way after the fact. So it feels like, oh, like this is kind of a weird
00:16:14 plot hole. I guess we can semi-try to justify it. And I suppose so. I mean this whole situation is
00:16:21 extremely like Ben was saying, it feels super unnecessary to have this weird double reach
00:16:26 around explanation for Rose. They should have just played it straight or they should have
00:16:30 happened to be separate characters. The reason they do it is because like I remember Rebecca
00:16:35 Sugar saying something about writing herself into a corner. Really? But like in like a cocky, like
00:16:41 yeah, but it's okay. I got it. I sorted out. I'm sort of the best writer. This is it. This is what
00:16:45 she wrote herself into a corner. What she did is that yellow and blue diamond are too powerful
00:16:51 and they hate- they loved pink diamond and Rose killed pink diamond. So the only way for like
00:16:58 Steven to, you know, beat them is either like literally overpower them, which is a bit much,
00:17:05 I guess, or to like reason with them. And if he just so happens to be pink diamond,
00:17:11 then they're now allies and they can fight white diamond or something. I guess that makes enough
00:17:18 sense. I absolutely believe that Rebecca planned from day one that Steven was going to be pink
00:17:23 diamond. I absolutely believe that. It just wasn't like pink diamond wasn't really even mentioned
00:17:30 for like the first three seasons, I think. Something feels- No, that's not- Season one,
00:17:35 we see pink diamond, I think, on the wall of one of the- I mean, there's a lot of like-
00:17:40 I can't remember exactly when we first see her, but I know in season one we do see the diamonds.
00:17:45 Well, remember that episode where they go to the weird Rose field with all that stuff? If I
00:17:51 remember correctly, I believe in that episode on the wall. I know that we at the very least see
00:17:55 some of the diamonds like on the wall, so the diamonds more intended. You see the insignia
00:17:59 like pretty early on. Yeah, the pink diamond insignia, I think beyond a shadow of a doubt,
00:18:04 proves there was intentions to make pink diamond a thing all along. Well, you know, something feels
00:18:09 cheap. Like, I think it would have been better if the revelation had come earlier and it was like-
00:18:15 Well, that's the story of Steven Universe. This whole thing is dragged out way too fucking long.
00:18:18 And Rose was just like a name that pink diamond had taken, but like the fact that she was literally
00:18:24 shapeshifting like the whole time for thousands of years, I don't know. Does it strike anyone
00:18:30 else as dumb? Absolutely. I think that is what we're all kind of feeling a little iffy about.
00:18:35 I mean, it was also weird. They showed like the flashback episode and it's like- and Pearl's
00:18:39 was like, oh, why don't we go down to the kindergarten and you can shapeshift as one of the
00:18:44 Quartzes. And so she does, but like she doesn't look like a Quartz. She looks like Rose Quartz.
00:18:48 She makes herself a special Snowflake Quartz. We have to do that.
00:18:55 No, no, no, guys. When they shapeshift, they can't- I haven't seen them change the color. For
00:19:00 instance, when Amethyst shapeshifts into things, she's always purple. She's always purple, but
00:19:04 she doesn't- but the shape is the same. Like Rose gets this weird fucking hair that isn't the same.
00:19:10 If you look at pink diamond, pink diamond is pink and Rose Quartz has flesh colored skin. So
00:19:16 that is a change. So that fear is right in the fucking garbage right there.
00:19:19 It's a bit off. It's a bit off.
00:19:21 We have other Rose Quartzes and so we can't think they have Rose Quartz.
00:19:26 Exactly. Therefore, it's a very odd choice for her to blend in with these Amethysts as a fucking Rose Quartz.
00:19:31 Well, she's being a stupid idiot. And Pearl is explaining that you're gonna draw attention to
00:19:36 yourself. I don't mind that too much, but I did notice that the skin color thing was a bit off.
00:19:40 But what I want to know is how the plus size community on Tumblr thinks it feels about this
00:19:46 betrayal. Pink diamond is fucking skinny. People literally committed suicide over this.
00:19:55 Oh my god. I didn't even- I didn't- No, there was a suicide attempt. Yes, real.
00:20:03 What? Okay, what actually happened was there was a fan artist lady who drew a skinnier version
00:20:09 of Rose Quartz and she received so much hate and death threats or something. That's right.
00:20:16 Such that she- I believe she did attempt suicide. Yeah, I remember that. I really hated how the
00:20:24 community bullied the person for drawing a thinner. It wasn't even like skinny. It was just like thinner
00:20:29 Rose Quartz. And in protest, I drew a skeletal Rose Quartz on my DeviantArt in protest. Yeah,
00:20:37 you did. I love that. But like- Fuck you. Real question. What if they knew at that time that
00:20:43 she had been pink diamond? Would that have made any difference, do you think? No, probably not.
00:20:47 You don't think so? They would have been mad at the fan artist and at Rebecca Sugar.
00:20:53 Like we're talking about kind of like identity politics and it's kind of like a weird-
00:20:57 I mean, identity politics and Tumblr people are linked to the show. I think like people were mad
00:21:01 that one of their fat icons was being drawn as you know like skinny, right? And it's like that,
00:21:06 I think is what they were rebelling against. And ironically, she was probably like the most like
00:21:10 normal proportioned character. She, oh my god, she's literally a- she culturally appropriated
00:21:17 fatness. She is in fact the worst offender of all time. She is a skinny bitch and she needs to-
00:21:23 Was that fat face? I really like pink diamonds design. I'm kind of annoyed that she didn't
00:21:27 keep the hair like that. Yeah. That was cool hair. Yeah. No, again, like we don't know how other
00:21:33 Rose Quartzes look like. So when she shapeshifted, she should have, you know, she'd probably look
00:21:37 like a Rose Quartz. I totally understand that. My question is that if she wants to blend in with
00:21:42 the regular Quartzes, why be a Rose Quartz? Because she cannot change color and I don't think-
00:21:47 Mej, we saw her change color. We have seen- Mej, not really. Days upon her visage that is different
00:21:54 in color. Mej, Mej, Mej. I'm not talking about the shade. The entire shape of her hair and her
00:22:00 face is different than the other Quartzes. And like, Amethyst can mimic anything. It just doesn't
00:22:05 have the right color. That is clearly done. Okay, now we're getting lost. What matters about this
00:22:10 debate is that it was clearly done as a visual indicator for our benefit as the audience. I
00:22:15 don't think this is something to really be criticized. Look, I'm an Autist and I get bogged down in
00:22:21 tiny details. Well, okay, this is my hypothesis. She looked like that because that's what Rose
00:22:26 Quartz looked like. Okay, well, but that's like a weird backwards logic. They had to make her look
00:22:31 like the character that we know and love. Well, okay, here's what I think would have been the
00:22:34 right move here. Okay, we have never seen another Rose Quartz ever. Does that mean that no other
00:22:39 Rose Quartz exists? They can't be true. They probably do. They can't be true. Because it wouldn't make
00:22:43 any sense for her to be named that. They think it was weird. We saw it. We didn't know that. Yes,
00:22:48 we do. In one episode, they've bubbled. They've bubbled all of them. They do. That is a plot
00:22:54 point that they bubbled all the other Rose Quartz. They bubbled them all because she was evil or
00:22:57 you know, because she made them hate them all. That's right. Right. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it wouldn't
00:23:01 make any sense for her to call herself Rose Quartz if Rose Quartz is not a real kind of gem.
00:23:06 Like, it's a real genocide, by the way. That's a real Rose Quartz genocide. The diamonds would be
00:23:11 like, wait, a Rose Quartz. What? That's not, that's not anything. Okay, but Mage proved it. They're
00:23:15 real. They are a thing. They are a thing. But here's my question though. Why did the show runners,
00:23:21 the directors and whatnot, choose to not show a single other Rose Quartz at this kindergarten?
00:23:27 Because it was an Amethyst kindergarten. Or a regular Quartz. But then why?
00:23:32 And that's my question. Why did she become a Rose Quartz? It's stupid. Maybe we can get
00:23:36 a geologist in the comments. Geologists in the comments explain, like, are Amethyst Quartz's
00:23:42 is a tambourine also? Here's the thing. The thing was, like, they could have gone to any other
00:23:47 number of, like, kindergartens that had Rose Quartz's on earth, if there were any. The reason
00:23:53 they went there is for that one scene where the the troupe was waiting for one and Amethyst is in
00:23:59 there. And that's like, because this is like our kindergarten. Within the universe, though, within
00:24:04 the universe, the reason why they went there is just like, oh, they're about to emerge. And she
00:24:09 wanted to see it to be there when they're emerging. That's like, in universe reason why she was there.
00:24:14 In Steven Universe. Yes. Also, like, I also have the issue with the fact that, like, it was all
00:24:22 Amethyst and she was the only Rose Quartz. Like, the main reason, like, the main issue I had, it
00:24:26 was no one questioned why a Rose Quartz was an Amethyst. That's been my point the whole time.
00:24:31 Yeah, it was very silly. Within the universe, no one questioned. They were not all Amethysts,
00:24:38 right? They were all Amethysts. I think they were a few higher rank ones. Some of them had other
00:24:44 names. I don't remember what they were, but they were called things like Tanzanite and whatever.
00:24:49 Yeah. Purple Rock. You know what, okay. I can't guarantee, but I don't know. Those are just their
00:24:55 names to distinguish between the Amethysts, I think. Well, you know what? You know what? If it's
00:25:00 a combination of things like, okay, Pink Diamond is pink. Rose Quartz was also pink. She's like,
00:25:04 ah, okay, I've got it. I'll be, you know, the other type of gem that is the same color as my gem.
00:25:09 And I'll, you know, rotate it so it looks like theirs. And I remember only seeing Amethysts,
00:25:15 but if you're saying that there were other gems too, then it's like, okay. Well, I guess there
00:25:19 probably was. I'm pretty sure they had other names besides Amethysts. No, the names they called out
00:25:24 were their numbers, sort of, so that they could distinguish between all the Amethysts.
00:25:28 Did they? Okay. I think that's the impression I got. I could be wrong, but I think that's the
00:25:34 I suddenly, I feel like I need to go and rewatch it for commenting. This is a small point, regardless.
00:25:47 I'll give you that, though, then. I think there might have been higher ranked gems that were not
00:25:51 Amethysts that were ordering Amethysts around. I didn't pay attention to that part, so I can't
00:25:56 say for sure, but it makes sense. If so, those might not have been born in the kindergarten.
00:26:01 They might have been from somewhere else. Yeah, but I mean, like if there were other
00:26:05 than Amethysts, then, you know, maybe this rose quartz was also, you know, one of the
00:26:09 others for some reason. Yeah, yeah, true. So I think we, I think we have enough ambiguity here
00:26:16 that we can assume that the disguise made sense in context. I think I just googled it and indigo
00:26:25 quartz is a real thing. So I guess like you could just put quartz after the end of a color and you
00:26:30 could get like a quartz, like that's like the default size for quartz is that tall and that,
00:26:36 you know, thick, you know what I'm saying. Nice, nice. Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.
00:26:42 I went to go pull up the episode. Didn't Amethyst come out like thousands of years later?
00:26:47 Yes, she did. Yeah, she was a freak. I guess it's a good thing that didn't, this annoys me.
00:26:54 It annoys me that things with gems happen on human time scales. Like all of those
00:26:59 quartz is emerged like within minutes of each other and then the one outlier took thousands
00:27:04 of years to come out. Well, she was pretty fucking defective. Not that much. She's just
00:27:09 all retarded. I mean, to me, I think I feel like they would all emerge over the course of maybe
00:27:15 like a year or a decade. I don't know, like that they would all come out within minutes of each
00:27:19 other. Maybe this is nitpicky. It just feels weird. Okay, one thing I sort of want to bring
00:27:26 up now, I don't remember if this is Canner was just a fan theory, but like when gems stay longer
00:27:33 or stay too short, they become different types of gems. So if she stayed for over a thousand years
00:27:39 or whatever, she should have become a different gem. I think if that's possible, I'm not sure how
00:27:45 Amethyst worked, but you know, those theories or whatever. We're gonna have to tweet at Rebecca
00:27:51 Sugar. She'll clear this up. By the way, I googled more. Amethyst is the name of purple quartz.
00:27:59 So Amethyst is quartz by default. Yeah, they're quartz. I am actually, I've just clicked through
00:28:05 the entire episode, the entire scene of her. I mean, they're there appear to be only like
00:28:14 big burly quartz like her, but there are no rose quartz at least on screen. But also I care
00:28:20 very little about this issue. So I'm just yeah, you know, I mean, none of the quartz there seem
00:28:26 to give a shit. So I knew do I? That's yeah, you know, I think we can just assume they were others
00:28:31 or something. Um, my God, does anyone have anything else to say about Steven Universe for the love
00:28:36 God? Let's move on to questions. Diamonds though. I mean, the diamonds are new.
00:28:42 I like the diamonds. You do like them? I liked the battle. I liked the fight at the end.
00:28:48 Oh, I love the battle. I was fucking sick. It was the best fight in all of Steven Universe.
00:28:54 Their boss battles were cool and like it didn't feel okay. It felt like they felt appropriately
00:29:02 powerful. Like it didn't feel like the diamonds just were suddenly like the diamonds were struggling.
00:29:06 No, sorry, the crystal gems were struggling the whole time. Like they're pretty strong,
00:29:10 but like they still had a really hard time even against just one of these diamonds.
00:29:14 I guess I'm I'm quite glad that they didn't overpower the diamonds because it's just like,
00:29:18 you know, they're built up to be like so powerful and so big. We have to protect our power scaling
00:29:23 for sure. Yeah. And if like a handful of gems could have defeated them, why didn't Roscoe
00:29:29 with an army? I would imagine a fusion would probably like they fused all together into
00:29:34 Alexandrite or whatever. And I think Alexandrite is like as big as a diamond. So it's as big.
00:29:41 I think it's smaller. Well, maybe. I mean, we didn't really see him next to each other. I don't
00:29:45 think. But I mean, I was glad that they did that and then address like why that wasn't working.
00:29:50 But they could have fused later on in the fight. I mean, they could have done that.
00:29:54 I thought that I thought that blues like crying aura was really cool. I loved that. I was into
00:30:00 that shape. That was like she's just like she's just so sad that she just like fucking emits this
00:30:05 field of like pain and like everyone in it is like incapacitated. Dude, that was literally
00:30:12 Kino. It was literally Kino. And I fucking loved every blue diamond. Also her voice is sexy as
00:30:17 hell. And I love blue diamond. She's the best. She's the best garbage. As soon as I saw her in
00:30:23 her fucking veil and her fucking pangolin. Yeah, what? No, what's the thing?
00:30:30 No, pangolin is a little funny animal. Damn it. It's a pangodopolis. I can't remember.
00:30:38 The thing everyone pronounces wrong. Walker. Palad box. AT-AT Palankeen. Palankeen. That's
00:30:44 what it is. And with her veil and her Palankeen, she was the coolest immediately. Also, did you
00:30:49 notice that the diamonds faces were really cool during this fight? This episode, no, no, no. This
00:30:55 episode, I got the impression like it had some pretty cool looking faces. And I felt like I think
00:31:01 this episode might have been storyboarded by an anime person like maybe someone from Japan.
00:31:06 I'm not too sure, but I saw something on Twitter. So, you know, take it with a grain of salt. But
00:31:11 I think one of the storyboarders actually has a manga going. I fucking called it.
00:31:18 It's called Naruto. Oh, no. Palankeen is also not the most
00:31:25 Kino form of transportation you've ever seen in your life. I love them, again, intensely. And the
00:31:31 scene of Blue Diamond more like crying over the pink overgrown Palankeen. Again, literal blood-borne
00:31:39 the best. Just so cool. Just so cool. I really appreciated how the fight scene was satisfying
00:31:49 enough, but it wasn't overindulgent in fighting because the show hasn't got a lot of fighting in
00:31:56 it. But when they do, it feels cool, but it's never enough. And with a thing like this, you want
00:32:03 all the characters there. You want all the guys doing all the moves, and you get enough of each of
00:32:08 them that you don't feel like anyone was shafted and everyone gets their moment to shine. And then
00:32:14 it's over. I still am waiting for Peridot to do anything. Yes, please.
00:32:22 She was adorable, though. She is the comic relief now, and it's kind of unfortunate. I don't want
00:32:29 to either. She was fucking dope. She was scary because of the threat of Homeworld that she
00:32:34 represented. She was physically powerful with their thing. She was a data analyst.
00:32:40 She had like little robots that did her fighting for her. She is not like a fighting gem. She
00:32:45 could get those back. I don't necessarily want to. I'm just saying if they gave her metal
00:32:51 bending powers, she should probably do something with it besides floating a soda can. She's done
00:32:55 literally nothing with it. It was a cool character thing to say. She had to rely on technology
00:33:02 because she didn't have any powers. But then they give her a power, and it's used for nothing but
00:33:06 jokes. It feels like it ruined an aspect of her character. That's true, but they haven't developed
00:33:10 her power yet, so her lifting something has to steal. It's been like a year and a half. They've
00:33:15 had to have it. I don't want her to be an ass-kicking badass. I don't want that to work.
00:33:21 I don't want her to become a badass. I just wanted to do something.
00:33:24 Fuck's sake. I'm trying to smash in my car into the lane just so people can cut me off
00:33:30 constantly just for breaking everything. I've killed seven children. I don't care. I want to
00:33:35 say this thing that Ben was already saying. I don't mind that she's not a combat person
00:33:44 in the same way they don't want Greg to suddenly become a super badass fighter.
00:33:49 I want that. That sounds pretty sick, dude. I want him to join Lars and the Stars.
00:33:55 Oh, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. He could be like the, you know, what's the...
00:34:00 He's the universe, man. I'm trying to think of like a musician, Brooke. He would be the
00:34:06 Brooke. I mean, Brooke has a sword. He needs to be... He's the bard of the party. He gives them like the
00:34:12 funny guitar melody and they go, yeah. Wait, wait, I just got to say Lars, Lars as fucking Simone
00:34:20 on the ship with the fucking jar with Greg's head in it, like Lord you know.
00:34:26 That'd be good. That'd be good. Greg needs to be like the guy.
00:34:29 I'm not sure how useless Greg was in that episode. It's just...
00:34:32 I mean, he's always used. I mean, Greg can't do anything to fight.
00:34:36 Yeah, but he felt like a little disconnected from the whole severity of the situation.
00:34:42 I mean, that's... He's a dead.
00:34:44 When everyone else was like just prepared to do something or like evacuating, Greg stayed in the
00:34:49 house, which is like, you know... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I was just gonna say that. It's a little weird.
00:34:55 We have like these fucking starships of these like cosmic entities that have come to Earth to like
00:35:02 fucking destroy everything potentially and Greg's solution is like, I'm just gonna wait inside.
00:35:08 That's a very Steven Universe thing to do.
00:35:10 Okay, but first he said it's time to turn on the old Greg Charm or Steven Universe Charm or
00:35:16 something, but he joked. What does that even mean?
00:35:18 He was gonna fuck those diamonds.
00:35:19 I think there's some... Because he did have this whole long
00:35:24 conversation with Blue Diamond and talked to her as an equal for a while.
00:35:27 So maybe that was what that was referring to. That's true.
00:35:30 Wait, do you remember when she first comes to Earth? Like they both have this whole conversation.
00:35:35 I completely forgot about that. You are absolutely right. That's actually a good thing.
00:35:39 But it's not like Blue Diamond was walking up in person. This was like her arm ship,
00:35:44 which by the way, the arm ships are pretty cool. They're pretty cool.
00:35:49 I don't know. I don't mind Greg making a joke, but I do think that
00:35:53 going, like go inside, like this is the ship is like the size of a mountain.
00:35:56 Like going in the house is not going to do anything.
00:35:59 I wonder where they're going to go with that one-eyed cat that they have.
00:36:05 He's just going to be a mascot. He's going to be there.
00:36:07 That's going to be a plus to sell on Cartoon Network.com.
00:36:10 It's a ton of runway of what to develop this cat into.
00:36:12 No, no, I feel like it will be a plus point in the future.
00:36:15 They'll develop the cat into a line of toys that they will sell for massive profit.
00:36:20 Sure, sure. Maybe he'll be the new Cookie Cat mascot.
00:36:23 Get the cat, get the pumpkin, collect all two.
00:36:25 Do it. I want a plushy pumpkin.
00:36:28 Collect all one-eyed.
00:36:29 I want like a funny, like a gooey, ewe, gross, sticky pumpkin plastic guy.
00:36:37 I do like pumpkin a lot.
00:36:38 They're going to throw at the wall and have it stick.
00:36:40 Pumpkin's pretty iconic, I got to say.
00:36:42 Just a little question slash trivia.
00:36:45 It's a Calico cat, I think, so it should be a female.
00:36:48 And I think it was established as a female.
00:36:51 Was it in the episode?
00:36:53 Oh yeah, they call it a bit.
00:36:54 Yeah, they're like mature.
00:36:56 Only like one in a thousand are male.
00:36:59 So hopefully it's not a special snowflake male Calico.
00:37:02 Hey, here's a crazy headcanon.
00:37:04 Pumpkin grows really huge and he's got four legs too.
00:37:08 He will be Steven Universe's Palin Keen.
00:37:12 Right? Pretty good.
00:37:14 Well, like Cinderella?
00:37:15 Yeah, like Cinderella. It'll be a thing.
00:37:17 Did you just hear my joke?
00:37:18 No.
00:37:19 No, we don't want to hear it again.
00:37:20 Is Pumpkin Keen?
00:37:21 Oh, yeah.
00:37:23 Well, that was a big bingo.
00:37:26 He's knocked it out of the park.
00:37:29 Can we talk about the whole headspace scene?
00:37:31 I really, really loved it.
00:37:32 Sure, sure.
00:37:33 I was a little disappointed that we weren't seeing the fight anymore.
00:37:38 But I guess I was pretty happy with what we did get,
00:37:40 like with Blue Diamonds' cool boss battle,
00:37:42 like fucking bullet hell attacks.
00:37:45 I was actually kind of like,
00:37:48 I enjoyed the fact that you could see them fighting
00:37:52 and it wasn't like a lot of scenes like this,
00:37:55 you know, Steven would give them the courage to move on
00:37:58 or like he would say something in the midst of battle
00:38:01 and everyone would be like,
00:38:02 you know what, I will keep fighting.
00:38:04 But the way it happened in this is a very unique way
00:38:07 that I've never seen anything anyone do before,
00:38:10 like to have the battle going on inside.
00:38:13 Like you could traverse them in a weird head area
00:38:16 that I don't know what it is.
00:38:17 Was this a pink diamond power or something?
00:38:19 I think it must be.
00:38:21 It had to be.
00:38:21 Pink diamonds is all about...
00:38:23 What's the explanation of why this happened?
00:38:25 I love when Steven Universe just pulls out new superpowers
00:38:29 when necessary.
00:38:30 That is what this was.
00:38:31 To be fair though, this wasn't actually...
00:38:34 What he's done before is he's shown like dream
00:38:37 contact with like people's bad minds and stuff.
00:38:40 He's got new powers all of a sudden before,
00:38:44 like the whole healing period.
00:38:45 You can't just say because Steven Universe
00:38:47 just randomly gets new powers.
00:38:49 No, no, no, no, no.
00:38:49 Like him getting new powers is the whole thing he does.
00:38:51 No, that's not my point.
00:38:52 My point is the whole premise,
00:38:55 the beginning of Steven Universe is Steven,
00:38:58 you know, he doesn't know really what he is.
00:39:00 The gems are training him to become a crystal gem.
00:39:04 At the very beginning of the show,
00:39:05 he didn't really have any powers.
00:39:07 And through the course of the show,
00:39:08 he gains new powers all of a sudden.
00:39:10 Oh, okay, but that's probably unsatisfying.
00:39:13 The tears, and now this one.
00:39:15 So he's over the course of the show,
00:39:16 he's learning new powers.
00:39:19 I guess he has done this before,
00:39:21 like he fucking possessed Lars' body.
00:39:23 Yeah, I feel like this is a version of his dream powers.
00:39:26 I feel something like he was, he was...
00:39:28 Okay, earlier in the episode, you remember this,
00:39:30 he couldn't contact, remember this,
00:39:32 this actually would make me far more charitable to the scene.
00:39:35 Remember when he has to go to sleep to contact...
00:39:37 He talks to the cluster, yeah.
00:39:38 The cluster, in almost the exact same sort of way,
00:39:42 seems to be what he's doing when he is unconscious,
00:39:44 because established, he has to be unconscious,
00:39:45 which is what happened, he got knocked out,
00:39:47 then he is able to contact the souls of these gem guys.
00:39:51 So I feel that they were going for a similar thing with those.
00:39:55 So I really, upon the second watch,
00:39:57 I was like, okay, I sort of see the connection here.
00:39:59 Yeah, and also pink diamond.
00:40:02 I mean, all the diamonds have a theme of powers.
00:40:06 Blue diamond's the most obvious, it's sadness,
00:40:08 it makes people emotions, and they cry.
00:40:13 Yellow is electricity.
00:40:15 Well, yellow is a big bird, and she is like tough and zappy.
00:40:22 I don't really know what her...
00:40:23 Hey, I have a head cannon, I have a head cannon,
00:40:25 that yellow diamonds, her electric powers,
00:40:28 are what are used to make those disrupter things
00:40:30 that they zap people with, because it looks the same.
00:40:32 Oh, definitely.
00:40:33 You think so?
00:40:33 Oh, definitely.
00:40:34 And pink diamond, through Steven,
00:40:37 we understand is all about healing and defense.
00:40:40 And so in this new power to commune with people,
00:40:45 and the fact that Steven loves talking,
00:40:48 it just makes sense that a pink diamond power
00:40:52 would be on this sort of like grand scale,
00:40:55 be able to talk to people through...
00:40:59 It was familiar.
00:41:01 Yeah, like to talk to people through the minds,
00:41:05 like to literally incept them from the hit movie Inception.
00:41:10 In the Captain Planet of Steven Universe,
00:41:13 he is the power of heart.
00:41:16 You know, I literally think that may have been like,
00:41:19 they thought that was a funny meme, but you know,
00:41:21 like, what if we actually made a show
00:41:22 where the main guy was that, and he wasn't a joke,
00:41:26 and then they did it?
00:41:27 Yeah, something like that, something like that.
00:41:30 Yeah, and then the bomb was over,
00:41:33 and that was the best part, the end.
00:41:35 Let's go on to questions.
00:41:36 Did you guys enjoy...
00:41:39 I just have to bring this up.
00:41:40 So like, there was a preview at the end of the episode
00:41:42 that showed like, they're gonna be talking to yellow
00:41:45 and blue next time, and the bomb...
00:41:46 Wait, there was a preview?
00:41:47 I've missed it.
00:41:48 Yeah, I mean, after the episode, there's like...
00:41:50 Okay, this is baffling to me.
00:41:53 Me and Michelle watched this, and we...
00:41:55 Our mouths were agape when we saw...
00:41:58 So this wasn't relevant to this particular Steven bomb.
00:42:01 It was relevant to...
00:42:02 It was a commercial for like, the last Steven bomb.
00:42:06 And this was a commercial running
00:42:08 all during the last Steven bomb,
00:42:09 and only on the last episode do we actually find out
00:42:12 that, you know, Pink Diamond is Rose Quartz.
00:42:18 The... I swear to God, this is true, but it is mind-boggling.
00:42:21 The preview that they put together
00:42:23 that aired at the end of each of the episodes
00:42:26 of the last Steven bomb.
00:42:28 So like, the first episode, this airs.
00:42:30 Second episode, this airs.
00:42:31 Before the last one, it starts off with the words,
00:42:34 Amethyst screaming,
00:42:35 Can you believe Pink Diamond?
00:42:37 It was Rose Quartz?
00:42:39 Haha, no way.
00:42:40 I swear to God, I swear to fucking God.
00:42:42 They spoiled in like, the preview for every episode
00:42:47 of the fucking thing that this was going to be revealed
00:42:50 in the final episode.
00:42:51 It's just like, what the fuck were they thinking?
00:42:54 That was a commercial before the last bomb?
00:42:57 That was the commercial that aired during the last bomb
00:43:00 in preparation for the final episode of that last bomb.
00:43:03 Are you fucking kidding me?
00:43:04 I'm 100% serious.
00:43:05 We did the research.
00:43:06 What the fuck?
00:43:07 It's real.
00:43:08 They really did that.
00:43:09 I remember something about this,
00:43:10 I think it must have been this on Twitter,
00:43:12 like people were pissed because there was a huge spoiler
00:43:14 and like, even like the Steven Universe team was like,
00:43:16 What the fuck, Sienna?
00:43:17 Yeah, because the cartoon network is so bad.
00:43:19 Put together this preview
00:43:21 without conferring with the Steven Universe guys,
00:43:23 obviously.
00:43:24 They just spoiled the hugest twist
00:43:26 in like the whole fucking series.
00:43:29 Well, that's pretty funny.
00:43:30 That's pretty fucking funny.
00:43:31 Just unbelievable.
00:43:33 I feel like whoever put the preview together
00:43:37 has never seen anything of Steven Universe.
00:43:40 I mean, no, I don't know.
00:43:41 They don't know that this is a fucking yes.
00:43:44 Look at this dramatic line.
00:43:46 This is a great way to cold open a commercial.
00:43:49 There's two things that matter to millennials.
00:43:51 Spoilers and feels.
00:43:52 You don't fuck with those.
00:43:53 That's right.
00:43:54 Fuck with both.
00:43:55 Hold on, hold on.
00:43:57 Wait, I got to make a joke,
00:43:58 but I got to look up some historical facts
00:44:00 before I can make it.
00:44:01 God damn it.
00:44:03 We'll get back to this joke, I guess.
00:44:04 Okay, imagine, imagine.
00:44:05 It's 1979.
00:44:08 Okay.
00:44:09 It's 1979.
00:44:11 You really enjoyed the first Star Wars movie
00:44:13 and you can't wait for George Lucas's second masterpiece,
00:44:16 The Empire Strikes Back.
00:44:17 A fucking commercial comes on TV.
00:44:20 Can you believe that?
00:44:21 Vader was Luke Skywalker's father?
00:44:23 That's exactly what it is.
00:44:25 That's exactly the kind of thing this was.
00:44:28 Unbelievable.
00:44:30 Unbelievable.
00:44:30 Fucking come see that revelation.
00:44:32 Imagine if that was like in the theater.
00:44:36 You watch the theater adverse
00:44:37 and then coming up next,
00:44:39 the Star Wars movie
00:44:40 that you just paid a ticket to see.
00:44:42 Yeah.
00:44:42 Can you believe?
00:44:46 Dark Vader was Luke's daddy.
00:44:50 Man.
00:44:52 Good.
00:44:52 Very, very fucking good.
00:44:53 I've never seen anything like it
00:44:55 in all my years of public broadcasting.
00:44:57 Speaking of weird stupid things
00:45:01 related to Steven Universe,
00:45:03 what do we think about the Steven Bombs
00:45:05 and how sometimes some of the Bombs
00:45:09 are just beach city people
00:45:11 that I could not kill us about?
00:45:14 Can we agree that like...
00:45:15 That we have Steven Bombs?
00:45:17 For all of the anime influence Steven Universe has,
00:45:20 why do they have to copy Shonen filler as well?
00:45:24 Like, like...
00:45:25 Okay, no, no, but like,
00:45:26 they say that Steven Universe has no filler quote unquote,
00:45:30 but it does.
00:45:31 No.
00:45:31 What they do is that they force you to watch the filler
00:45:35 because at the very end,
00:45:36 Steven learns a little bit.
00:45:38 That's right.
00:45:38 Like it has a little bit of character development
00:45:41 that you need to know going forward
00:45:44 because he'll reference it.
00:45:45 That's exactly how they do it.
00:45:45 I don't mind the Bombs format.
00:45:48 In fact, I think I like it,
00:45:50 but I do.
00:45:51 What I mind is just the glacial pace that episodes come out.
00:45:54 I think the biggest problem is that they,
00:45:56 Steven Universe starts like four or five different plot threads
00:46:00 at the same time
00:46:00 and then doesn't solve any of them
00:46:03 and lets a bunch hang.
00:46:04 And it's not like a regular show
00:46:06 where like a plot could hang around for like four or five weeks.
00:46:09 It just hangs out for like a year.
00:46:11 Years.
00:46:12 Yeah.
00:46:12 And it's just like,
00:46:13 I don't even care anymore at this point.
00:46:16 Yeah.
00:46:16 I guess it's not that bad
00:46:18 because in the last year,
00:46:20 24 episodes have come out.
00:46:23 About 20,
00:46:24 it's slightly over a year,
00:46:25 24 episodes,
00:46:26 half length episodes.
00:46:27 I don't know.
00:46:28 That's pretty fucking sweet.
00:46:29 That's terrible.
00:46:30 It's,
00:46:30 regardless of how slow it literally is,
00:46:33 even if it's like the normal amount
00:46:34 for like an anime or whatever,
00:46:36 it feels way slower because of the Bombs.
00:46:40 Like I don't like binging.
00:46:41 I think binging is stupid.
00:46:43 I like watching a couple episodes of anything.
00:46:47 Say if I want to like watch.
00:46:48 It's complete.
00:46:50 Yeah.
00:46:52 Even then,
00:46:52 I don't like it because like you get through it
00:46:55 and then you forget most of,
00:46:57 because it was just one long blur of stuff.
00:47:00 And like things that are supposed to resonate with you
00:47:03 because they come out weekly do not.
00:47:06 I like binging because I forget things over time.
00:47:10 And that's why I hate the Bombs
00:47:11 because I forget to care and no one's come out.
00:47:15 I watch like,
00:47:16 if I want to show like the Game of Thrones or whatever,
00:47:19 I watch like a couple episodes
00:47:21 or three episodes per day for a week.
00:47:24 I don't watch like 10 in a day.
00:47:27 I don't watch as many as I possibly can.
00:47:29 I mean, the maximum is three.
00:47:30 Usually it's just one.
00:47:31 Sometimes it's like one per week.
00:47:34 I don't like binging because it,
00:47:36 like I don't like waiting a long time,
00:47:39 but spreading it out is just sensible
00:47:41 because it allows you to appreciate what you've just seen.
00:47:45 So what did you freaks and geeks think
00:47:49 of the whole fucking Ruby and Sapphire marriage thing?
00:47:55 I just want to quickly say,
00:47:56 I really liked how in that one episode,
00:47:59 like Sapphire was trying to use future vision
00:48:03 and she was like, why is she a cowboy?
00:48:05 And that felt so random.
00:48:07 But then in the next episode, it makes sense.
00:48:09 Oh, but like, that would be a perfect reason.
00:48:13 I had seen the preview.
00:48:14 So when she said that I knew that it was a thing
00:48:16 that was going to come back and I was like, uh-huh.
00:48:18 Yeah, good job.
00:48:21 That was one of the things that I was thinking.
00:48:22 Like if they had spread that out,
00:48:24 that would have been way funnier
00:48:25 because you would remember, wait,
00:48:27 she did say like a couple of weeks ago that there was a cowboy
00:48:30 and I thought it was just a silly joke, but it was real.
00:48:33 Yeah, I sort of agree with that.
00:48:35 Though, I mean, there's like two,
00:48:36 there's two ways to like watch a show.
00:48:38 It's like being up to date and like currently aware of it.
00:48:41 But then I also always want to think about like,
00:48:43 well, what's it going to be like in a decade
00:48:45 when the show is all out
00:48:45 and somebody just watches all the episodes, you know, for fun?
00:48:49 I hate binging.
00:48:53 I will kill bingers, binge slay.
00:48:56 In whatever format they want.
00:48:57 You know, one episode a day.
00:48:58 I'll destroy it.
00:48:59 I respect you less if you binge.
00:49:02 You should, you couch potatoes.
00:49:04 You are, you should stand up to-
00:49:05 Well, binging, you're not binging.
00:49:07 Can we all agree that the whole bomb format is just bombs?
00:49:11 I mean, I like it.
00:49:12 So I kind of like it.
00:49:14 How do you-
00:49:15 I kind of like the mini binge thing.
00:49:18 I don't know.
00:49:18 It's so slow.
00:49:19 No, like maybe it would work if it came out more frequently.
00:49:22 Yeah.
00:49:23 I would prefer consistency.
00:49:25 I'd rather just come out once a week
00:49:27 and I could just like become part of my weekly routine and-
00:49:31 Well, you know what?
00:49:31 It doesn't necessarily have to come out like once a week.
00:49:35 I think a regular schedule, whatever,
00:49:38 like if they have a bomb every two months,
00:49:40 then you can get hyped for the next one.
00:49:42 But, you know, you're still waiting.
00:49:44 But you're not like waiting like there's no reason to think about it
00:49:48 because I have no idea when it's coming out.
00:49:50 And I'll never know anything.
00:49:51 So I'm just gonna forget about Steven.
00:49:54 Yeah, exactly.
00:49:55 That's how I feel because like when the bomb's over,
00:49:57 it's like, okay, time to wait another 300 years.
00:50:00 Because I wish I knew when's the next bomb coming out.
00:50:05 I hate the fact.
00:50:06 I hate this.
00:50:07 I hate.
00:50:09 Oh, man.
00:50:10 She just hates.
00:50:11 She just hates.
00:50:11 I just hate everything.
00:50:13 About to get a little violent up in here.
00:50:14 Hating everything.
00:50:16 Let's talk about this gay wedding.
00:50:19 Oh, yeah, I like how I have become enlightened
00:50:24 in that I didn't even realize,
00:50:26 I didn't even realize that it was like potentially
00:50:30 like a breakthrough in animation to have a gay wedding.
00:50:34 I was just like, yeah, cool.
00:50:35 Oh, yeah.
00:50:36 It's like, it's not even, well, you know, here's the thing
00:50:40 that I think I've said about Ruby and Sapphire specifically
00:50:45 is I feel like it's kind of cheating.
00:50:47 It doesn't feel that gay because, no, I'm serious.
00:50:51 Because this is their only option.
00:50:52 They got no choice here.
00:50:53 Well, okay, yeah.
00:50:54 For one thing, gems are only female.
00:50:56 So that's like, well, whatever.
00:50:59 And then second of all, Ruby is the most,
00:51:01 is like the most masculine gem.
00:51:03 She wasn't in the dress, so it's all okay.
00:51:05 I was surprised.
00:51:06 I was really surprised by that too.
00:51:08 That Ruby wore the dress and Sapphire wore the dress.
00:51:11 She looked really cool though.
00:51:12 I didn't like how Sapphire looked.
00:51:15 The little suit and her hair tied back.
00:51:17 It was adorable.
00:51:17 I loved it.
00:51:18 It was great.
00:51:19 I mean, Ruby looked terrible, but you know, whatever.
00:51:21 No, she looked adorable.
00:51:23 I thought she was really cute.
00:51:25 I thought she was really cute,
00:51:26 but I felt like her hair may have,
00:51:28 she could have done something about that cube hair.
00:51:31 She should have done, her hair is just terrible,
00:51:33 basically all the time.
00:51:34 Ruby looked great in the cowboy hat, in my opinion.
00:51:38 I was into it.
00:51:39 I was pretty into it.
00:51:41 I liked how the top, the top hair puff,
00:51:43 kind of fit right up into the 10 gallon region.
00:51:47 What is known as the 10 gallon region of the hat.
00:51:50 I guess I would just say on the subject of the wedding,
00:51:53 like I feel similar to Ben.
00:51:55 It's a little bit of cheating, but like, I don't know.
00:51:57 I feel no-
00:51:57 It's just never, Sapphire and Ruby,
00:52:00 and just the whole fusion that it's just never felt,
00:52:02 they try to be like, oh, I mean,
00:52:04 they don't come right out and say it,
00:52:05 but people talk about it like,
00:52:06 oh, it's groundbreaking because it's gay.
00:52:08 And I'm like, well, maybe it is technically.
00:52:10 It just doesn't feel that gay.
00:52:12 I don't know.
00:52:12 It doesn't feel like any ground has been broken here.
00:52:14 This male ciz cuck is projecting too much gayness
00:52:19 that he doesn't even understand.
00:52:20 And he doesn't know that they're just normal people.
00:52:23 I don't know.
00:52:23 I mean, if people, if people want to get excited about,
00:52:25 that's fine.
00:52:26 I guess, I just want to say that.
00:52:27 It doesn't seem like that, that noteworthy.
00:52:29 I feel like it's good on this note to just,
00:52:32 although now they actually had him kiss.
00:52:34 Because like, I feel like-
00:52:35 Yeah.
00:52:36 That was definitely like, oh, we can't do that usually.
00:52:39 That was such an anime kiss.
00:52:40 I don't think so.
00:52:41 I don't think so.
00:52:41 Okay, because it's been like, basically the whole time,
00:52:45 it's been really obvious that like,
00:52:47 a fusion is like a relationship.
00:52:49 Yeah.
00:52:50 But they've never, it's never, it's never-
00:52:52 They've never really been allowed to,
00:52:54 but now they've gone away with it.
00:52:55 It's never been like straight up fucking.
00:52:56 But like, that kiss was just straight up fucking.
00:52:58 Like, these tensions, but yeah.
00:52:59 You guys know what I'm saying.
00:53:00 Okay, Ruby has had her sordid kiss before,
00:53:03 but rather like, I think Ruby was kissing Sapphire's neck
00:53:05 or something.
00:53:06 So it wasn't like a lip kiss.
00:53:07 No, no.
00:53:08 Okay, but it's the first kiss on the lips when they fused.
00:53:12 Well, what I was going to say is,
00:53:13 I agree with all that sentiment,
00:53:15 but I feel like it's good,
00:53:17 even if this is possibly not satisfying.
00:53:20 Ben, let me finish, god damn it.
00:53:21 I'm sorry.
00:53:21 It's, even if it's a slightly less gay thing
00:53:25 than it could be, perhaps,
00:53:26 due to these various biological gem reasons,
00:53:29 I feel like it's kind of good and not too cheap in it.
00:53:31 It's good to like get it out of the way.
00:53:33 Because like, oh, okay.
00:53:34 Now we've got just like a children's cartoon, gay wedding.
00:53:37 Great. Okay.
00:53:37 Now here we are moving on with our lives.
00:53:39 You know?
00:53:39 Yeah.
00:53:40 And I'm not, I don't really care about this kind of stuff at all,
00:53:43 but it's just like an updated outfit outside her dress suit.
00:53:47 Well, she's got the rings now, right?
00:53:50 I hope the rings, I hope she keeps wearing them.
00:53:52 Hey, hey, you know what's going to happen, guys?
00:53:54 You know what's going to happen?
00:53:55 You know why it is that Lapis Lazuli and Peridot got poofed?
00:54:00 It's so that when they reform,
00:54:01 they can have stars on their uniforms instead of diamonds.
00:54:04 That's what it's for.
00:54:05 I'm telling you right now, that's what it's for.
00:54:08 They're going to look cool.
00:54:09 They're going to look different.
00:54:09 They're going to look better.
00:54:10 That's pretty good.
00:54:11 You better, you bet, that better happen.
00:54:12 So I'll be so disappointed if it doesn't.
00:54:15 Imagine if Peridot just reformed still
00:54:17 with a fucking yellow diamond.
00:54:18 Oh, but she'll be a little bitch.
00:54:19 I will kill her if she does that shit.
00:54:21 Oh my god.
00:54:21 Yeah.
00:54:21 She'll be destroyed.
00:54:22 She'll be quickly mentioned.
00:54:23 That'll ruin the whole show for me.
00:54:24 You've potentially ruined Steven Universe for me.
00:54:26 That would be awful, yeah.
00:54:27 Guys, Bismuth.
00:54:28 Yeah.
00:54:29 Oh, Bismuth did come back.
00:54:32 Yeah, she's going to be part of the group, I'm guessing.
00:54:34 Did she get poofed?
00:54:35 Did Bismuth poof?
00:54:36 No, no, she was fine.
00:54:37 No, she fight.
00:54:38 I liked her armor.
00:54:39 I thought it was cool.
00:54:40 Oh, yeah, me too.
00:54:40 I liked all the Bismuth puns.
00:54:43 Did you Bismuth me?
00:54:45 No, no, no, no.
00:54:46 Bad pun.
00:54:47 No, I love them.
00:54:49 I love puns.
00:54:50 Terrible.
00:54:51 The most they are the ones I love them.
00:54:53 I know the point was that they were terrible, but they're still.
00:54:55 What did you guys think of Steven's song at the beginning?
00:54:58 I loved it.
00:54:59 Loved it.
00:55:00 I loved it.
00:55:00 Was way into it.
00:55:01 I couldn't.
00:55:01 I wasn't sure.
00:55:02 I was like, sometimes I like it.
00:55:05 I don't know.
00:55:05 I usually don't like Steven Universe's songs with the exception of a few,
00:55:09 but this one was nice.
00:55:11 I like the part.
00:55:12 I think it just wasn't in the mood.
00:55:12 I think I wasn't in the mood to hear a song.
00:55:14 It was nice to hear Steven.
00:55:15 It was very, what was that one?
00:55:19 One where Twilight pushes out the door and she's like,
00:55:22 ah, everything's going to be fucking great.
00:55:23 It's a great day to be a gay horse.
00:55:24 Yeah, this day is going to glimmer.
00:55:26 Yeah, yeah.
00:55:28 Well, I mean, I liked when he was like, you know,
00:55:31 he really embraced who he was and was like, this old Ruby rider.
00:55:34 That's me, Steven Universe, aka Ruby.
00:55:37 No, I was just going to say that I really, really liked Ruby's song.
00:55:41 I loved that as well.
00:55:41 I mean, that was really cute.
00:55:42 That was really cute.
00:55:43 I really liked the whole episode of Ruby going off
00:55:48 on her own was like, it was a real like emotional journey for me
00:55:52 because I was like really excited.
00:55:54 Like when Ruby was getting excited about being his own,
00:55:57 sorry, her own person, I was like, I was like, cool.
00:56:01 Like, good for you.
00:56:04 The problem with that is that I not for one second
00:56:06 believed that was going to last or like, you know.
00:56:08 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:56:09 I didn't either.
00:56:10 Like I knew that of course Ruby's going to decide,
00:56:13 oh, I need Sapphire.
00:56:14 And I was almost like sad.
00:56:16 I was like, no, but Ruby, like, what's Ruby going to be like?
00:56:20 What's the new Ruby adventure?
00:56:22 Yeah, that's what I want.
00:56:23 Be your own gem.
00:56:25 But, you know, I don't know.
00:56:26 I guess they sold me on it.
00:56:27 You know, I feel attached to this very day.
00:56:30 Because when Steven, because when Steven talked to Ruby
00:56:32 and she was like, oh, you know, I just really love being with her.
00:56:35 Yeah.
00:56:35 And I like thinking about her.
00:56:37 Because I was gone.
00:56:38 Yeah, kind of, but I was sold and it was genuine enough
00:56:41 that when she finally went back, I wasn't that disappointed.
00:56:44 I was like, you know what, I'm happy for her.
00:56:45 I knew that they were going to get back together.
00:56:47 But like what really sort of like got to me a little bit
00:56:50 was the, just the thought of like garnet ceasing to exist.
00:56:55 Like if they actually split up and never came back together,
00:56:58 garnet just dies basically.
00:57:01 No, we can't.
00:57:01 Mage, we can't depict a negative homosexual relationship.
00:57:05 We can't do that.
00:57:06 Well, by the same token, if garnet does exist,
00:57:08 then Ruby and Sapphire pretty much die.
00:57:11 So, you've got to trade off here.
00:57:14 And he's just being, I know, I know, but it was like.
00:57:16 Why do you hate Ruby and Sapphire, Mage?
00:57:18 Why?
00:57:19 I don't.
00:57:21 There's just like, what, they're together.
00:57:24 Where's the giant woman?
00:57:24 Like they're, like, garnet is the trench coat.
00:57:28 And they're the two little lesbians in it.
00:57:30 But when they're apart, there's no trench coat.
00:57:34 But, well, the good news, that's true.
00:57:36 The good news is when Ruby and Sapphire are apart,
00:57:38 we can get cool different types of fusions with Rubies and Sapphires
00:57:42 as opposed to a big old fucking garnet.
00:57:44 I wouldn't be opposed to seeing those fusions.
00:57:47 It's just like the idea of, like, garnet to stop existing.
00:57:50 It's like losing a friend.
00:57:53 A character's death in a way, and it's weird.
00:57:55 It struck me as weird at that moment, the thought.
00:57:58 I'm just saying, you know, the thought of it was kind of weird to me.
00:58:01 Also, I don't like the Steven Universe.
00:58:02 What if Ruby cheated on Sapphire by fusing with someone else?
00:58:06 I was just going to say, I don't like Steven.
00:58:09 The one thing I have with fusions,
00:58:11 I don't like the, they try to have it both ways.
00:58:13 The fusion is both like a romantic thing,
00:58:16 and it's also just like a thing you do for utility.
00:58:19 Like, I guess it's like, I don't know.
00:58:20 Like, let's say...
00:58:21 It is.
00:58:21 It's muddied.
00:58:22 It's like, it's like...
00:58:23 It's like, it's basically like doing donkey raises at the gym with your gym, bro.
00:58:28 Which is, here's what a donkey raise is.
00:58:31 It's where you bend over 90 degrees forward at your waist.
00:58:36 Your bro sits on your back with his legs spread wide,
00:58:40 and then you do calf raises with him, you know, sitting on your back like so.
00:58:45 Like, it's a very intimate act, but it is for utilitarian purposes, you know.
00:58:50 I don't believe you, unless you're utilitarian being gay.
00:58:54 It's an intimate act.
00:58:55 It's an...
00:58:55 Well, that's like, it's similar.
00:58:57 Like, yeah, like...
00:58:59 Well, like, yeah, you could do that, like, with your significant other,
00:59:02 but like, okay, there's also reason to do it, you know, get sick calf gains, you know.
00:59:06 It's so bizarre.
00:59:06 These are equally valid things to do.
00:59:09 Please draw this picture, everyone.
00:59:11 This is too gay, even for the Steven Universe.
00:59:16 My favorite thing about Ruby is that, is the voice and how it sounds just like
00:59:23 the classic shitty character guy who doesn't know who Batman is.
00:59:27 Yeah, I do love her voice.
00:59:30 I mean, it's like, oh my god.
00:59:32 It's the voice of all the other rubies.
00:59:35 It's true.
00:59:36 Does anybody remember that shitty character, though?
00:59:38 Are you talking about Jimmy Olson?
00:59:40 No, wait, that's...
00:59:41 No, the man who doesn't know who Batman is.
00:59:43 Oh, the big fat guy.
00:59:44 Like that, the guy who works for the...
00:59:46 No, it was a character Jesse invented on the Katamari stream at Redcon.
00:59:51 I guess none of you were there.
00:59:54 People who know are laughing their butts off, remembering it,
00:59:58 because it's the funniest character in the world.
01:00:03 Sapphire sucks, though.
01:00:05 I could not be less interested in Sapphire's whole life.
01:00:09 Yeah, that's how I feel.
01:00:10 Yeah, I agree.
01:00:13 Ruby's better.
01:00:14 Oh my god, the web of possibilities, everything was...
01:00:17 Okay, first of all, first of all, what the fuck was she even talking about?
01:00:21 Like, there were no possibilities other than the set path until Ruby did like...
01:00:25 What? Can you...
01:00:26 Don't you read like the multiple pathways of the future?
01:00:29 Here's the thing.
01:00:30 It's that future vision.
01:00:32 Future vision is Steven Universe is just literally exactly the same
01:00:36 as thinking about what might possibly happen.
01:00:39 No, because it's like...
01:00:40 You're right, you're right.
01:00:41 No, her future vision only works if like nothing has any possibility of going differently.
01:00:48 If like everything...
01:00:49 If like if there's any random elements, like an unpredictable person like Ruby,
01:00:53 then it doesn't work anymore because it's not predictable.
01:00:55 Well, that's right.
01:00:56 It's just a way for smart people to say they're magical.
01:01:01 Yeah, it sucks.
01:01:02 So what you're saying is that Sapphire is a fraud and always has been?
01:01:06 No.
01:01:06 I'm saying was she...
01:01:08 It just doesn't...
01:01:09 It doesn't mean anything.
01:01:10 It's all the fucking tricky double speeds.
01:01:12 Okay, right now because of Steven and Ruby or they're being unearthed,
01:01:17 there's so many possibilities that it is kind of a bit useless.
01:01:20 But back then when she was, you know, a Sapphire of a diamond,
01:01:25 diamond, like the whole gems and stuff, the...
01:01:28 Everything was very strictly all.
01:01:30 Everyone had a purpose.
01:01:31 They had a place.
01:01:33 And like there was not a lot of room for deviation.
01:01:36 I guess thematically it does work.
01:01:37 Like like even in this bomb, like it was...
01:01:40 I think it was Pink who said like Earth is like full of possibilities where anything can happen.
01:01:44 And that's kind of like been a through line throughout the entire series.
01:01:47 Yeah, that's right.
01:01:47 Remember that episode where Garnet acted so random?
01:01:50 Dude, remember when she worked at the donut place?
01:01:53 Oh man, that was planned.
01:01:53 And then she like did a backflip over the counter or something?
01:01:56 I don't know.
01:01:57 Yeah, she ran out in the rain because it was so unpredictable.
01:02:02 Damn, that was a good answer.
01:02:04 Nobody would expect that.
01:02:06 That episode was basically the monsters podcast.
01:02:11 You're not wrong.
01:02:12 You're not wrong.
01:02:13 The best one.
01:02:14 I like that the monsters podcast is now a meme.
01:02:16 I love that it's a meme.
01:02:17 Now everyone needs to go listen to it a thousand times.
01:02:19 Be our most viewed episode.
01:02:21 Personally, my least favorite Steven episode is the one about the rivalry between pizza and fry town.
01:02:26 That one was a terrible chore.
01:02:29 I'll tell you what my least favorite episode of Steven Universe is.
01:02:32 And it wasn't in this Steven bomb, but it was a recent one.
01:02:35 And it was the one where that fucking Saint Kevin does everything to repair Steven and Connie's relationship
01:02:42 and gives great advice about life.
01:02:44 And yet the narrative insists on mercilessly shitting on him
01:02:49 as if he has zero value as a human being and is merely an object of pity,
01:02:53 despite helping the characters and being a positive influence in their lives.
01:02:58 Well, but Kevin was a big douchebag in previous episodes.
01:03:01 And today it's time to, like, they gave him the charity of like,
01:03:05 oh, he's only the worst person ever because he had his feelings hurt once
01:03:09 by some relationship or something.
01:03:11 And then, but then they proceed to Connie says like,
01:03:14 yeah, he seems like he deserves it or something like that.
01:03:16 It's like Jesus Christ.
01:03:18 You can't even give him the slightest.
01:03:20 I felt like that was a just, like,
01:03:22 they hate him, they hate him.
01:03:24 I wonder when they'll pick up the little
01:03:26 guys even think here, uh,
01:03:28 by the genocidal monster diamonds of space can be redeemed,
01:03:33 but not Kevin, but Kevin, it's true.
01:03:37 Kevin has to be shown, Kevin has to be shown to be wrong in all of his doing
01:03:43 because he represents the idea of like,
01:03:46 he represents like, like, you know, non genuineness or something.
01:03:51 He's a guy.
01:03:52 That's why he's like, he's like a corrupted,
01:03:54 he's like a sort of older kid who's like,
01:03:56 he's like, he's been corrupted by like the evils of the world,
01:03:59 you know, like, like the pain of life has turned him into a monster.
01:04:03 And like the show needs to.
01:04:04 Okay, guys, I mean, they redeemed Lars eventually.
01:04:08 Maybe they'll redeem Kevin eventually.
01:04:10 I will bet you right now.
01:04:11 Kevin never gets redeemed ever.
01:04:13 The reason the reason Kevin is now here.
01:04:15 He's a straight right now.
01:04:16 Because Lars is gone.
01:04:17 The worst enemy of all of progressiveness, probably.
01:04:20 I don't think he is white.
01:04:21 Well, he's kind of like off.
01:04:23 He's like reddish or something.
01:04:24 I do think.
01:04:25 But he's, he's characterized as bad.
01:04:27 So he must be white.
01:04:28 There's, there's, I mean, let's, let's just real quick run through the characteristics of Kevin.
01:04:33 He's absolutely vain.
01:04:34 He's absolutely superficial.
01:04:36 He is absolutely willing to like use people and only cares about like societal status.
01:04:41 He's, he's, he is also forward basically overall.
01:04:45 And all of these things are depicted as inherently bad things to be.
01:04:50 And Nate's personally insulted.
01:04:52 I mean, I, I, I know this is a personal thing.
01:04:55 You, you like him.
01:04:56 Well, I like him too.
01:04:56 That's a character.
01:04:57 I like him too.
01:04:58 I think he is absolutely not a good person.
01:05:01 He is a damaged individual.
01:05:03 I don't know.
01:05:03 I don't know if we'll ever see him again.
01:05:05 But I think that if we do, I think he can be redeemed.
01:05:08 And I think the show will probably go out of its way.
01:05:10 I want more Kevin and less Ronaldo.
01:05:12 We've, we've seen, I mean, we've humanized him in that episode.
01:05:15 Yeah, guys.
01:05:15 Okay.
01:05:15 My, my, here's a quick theory.
01:05:17 I have absolutely no basis for this, but when they bring up the pink hair girl,
01:05:21 the pearl heart crush on for episode two.
01:05:24 Yeah.
01:05:24 When, when, when they, when they bring her up, I think Kevin's going to cut Pearl.
01:05:28 That's it.
01:05:29 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
01:05:30 Like around the same time, I feel like they'll bring back Kevin for better or for worse.
01:05:36 I have no basis.
01:05:37 Are you aware, are you aware of the, girl?
01:05:40 This is a theory I've heard once or twice.
01:05:41 That girl is the girl that he mentioned who like broke his heart.
01:05:45 I mean, there's no basis for that.
01:05:46 Wait, wait, the girl he mentioned, he did what?
01:05:48 Well, like in this, in the episode, he talks about like how he'll never let what happened
01:05:52 to him with insert name of girl that I forget.
01:05:55 Like he'll never let that happen again.
01:05:56 So he'll be vain and superficial and winner back and blah.
01:05:59 I hope so.
01:06:00 I hope that's true.
01:06:02 I hope it's her.
01:06:03 Oh, dude, dude, imagine a Kevin Pearl love triangle.
01:06:08 Imagine those two like having a conversation.
01:06:11 The thing is, some of that is like, is, is, is fucking.
01:06:15 Like that girl is clearly a lesbian with her funny hair.
01:06:18 Yeah, that's an assumption.
01:06:20 That's an assumption.
01:06:22 And I mean, the pearl is a lesbian, but she might be bisexual.
01:06:25 I don't know.
01:06:26 They can't not be.
01:06:28 Yeah.
01:06:28 Like Kevin was shunned by her because he's a douchebag or whatever.
01:06:32 Of course it was at least bisexual, by the way.
01:06:34 But what if, what if they, they, they make Kevin into the first trans cartoon character
01:06:41 where he goes through the motions and he's like, I'm a girl now.
01:06:45 Now I feel better.
01:06:46 Now, now I'm not a douchebag.
01:06:47 Now that I'm not a filthy male, that's what they're going to do.
01:06:51 I think that's what they're going to do.
01:06:52 That's going to be very funny.
01:06:53 Jesse Pearl making those bedroom eyes at the horse amethyst.
01:06:56 Sure did.
01:06:57 Sure did.
01:06:57 I saw Zen Huxables tweet.
01:06:59 You guys saw Zen Huxables tweet?
01:07:00 Yeah.
01:07:01 It's like, yeah.
01:07:01 I think it, did he say below that, what did they mean by this?
01:07:04 It was something like that.
01:07:05 He drew them.
01:07:06 He redrew them.
01:07:07 Oh, did he?
01:07:07 Oh, I didn't see that.
01:07:08 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:07:09 Cool, cool.
01:07:11 Yeah, the show hates men.
01:07:12 That's, you know, that's really all there is to say about it.
01:07:15 You know?
01:07:15 That's why, that's why Greg, I believe that Greg will be killed in the next
01:07:22 God, I hope so.
01:07:22 Set him free.
01:07:23 Before being, before being symbolically, after being symbolically castrated and then literally castrated.
01:07:28 I don't know, stuff.
01:07:35 Well, I don't know.
01:07:36 What else, what else?
01:07:36 There's more to say here, I guess.
01:07:38 Imagine, no, okay, I'm just going to imagine, imagine if Greg gets remarried to one of the other
01:07:45 diamonds.
01:07:46 Okay.
01:07:46 Wait, no, he never married, he never married Pink River, but you know what I fucking mean.
01:07:50 Sure.
01:07:50 Um, imagine, what do you think?
01:07:53 Like, like blue diamonds?
01:07:54 How likely are we on a 10 out of 10 scale?
01:07:56 On a what?
01:07:57 On what?
01:07:58 He's fucking gonna, he's gonna hook up with the diamonds.
01:08:00 He's gonna hook up with blue diamond because, you know, he got with the diamonds before.
01:08:04 Because why not?
01:08:05 He is rich.
01:08:05 Because why not?
01:08:06 He is rich.
01:08:06 Why not?
01:08:07 Tell me why.
01:08:08 Yeah, he's rich.
01:08:09 Just give me one fucking good guy.
01:08:10 I mean, she is a giant woman, so I wouldn't be surprised.
01:08:14 Yeah.
01:08:15 There we go.
01:08:16 There we go.
01:08:17 Yes.
01:08:18 Please do this.
01:08:19 I mean, there's a new Steven.
01:08:21 What a great show.
01:08:21 Blueven.
01:08:23 Universe.
01:08:25 No.
01:08:25 Does, does, does, does Greg like giant women because he's a manlet?
01:08:30 He's not a man.
01:08:31 He's pretty, I mean, he's a decently sized guy.
01:08:33 I think, no, he's, he's pretty short, I think.
01:08:35 He's pretty short.
01:08:36 No, he's just fat.
01:08:37 He makes him look short.
01:08:38 I mean, he's way shorter than, um, I feel like he's the shortest guy in, like, any scene that he's in.
01:08:44 I'm going to check this right now.
01:08:45 Steven Universe cast.
01:08:46 I'm going to see how.
01:08:47 You will never find, like, the heights are never consistent.
01:08:50 You'll never find an image that actually confirms anything.
01:08:53 Remember, remember when Amethyst and Steven were the same height when she was,
01:08:57 when she was putting those flowers on the fucking thing?
01:08:59 Exactly the same height.
01:09:00 That was so weird.
01:09:01 And I was like, is she transformed?
01:09:03 Like, is she going to fucking grow again?
01:09:05 And she didn't.
01:09:05 And I was like, what?
01:09:06 Steven was, like, knee-high for Garnet.
01:09:12 I mean, Steven is, like, kind of like.
01:09:13 So when she was, when Garnet was, like, messing around and doing random stuff,
01:09:18 his size, like, changed eight times, I think.
01:09:21 Like, in the wedding episode, Amethyst and Steven are, like, exactly the same size.
01:09:26 Yeah.
01:09:26 I didn't notice that.
01:09:27 The one thing I can say about that is, like, they have been, like,
01:09:31 there was a few episodes about, like, Steven is growing, but just really slowly,
01:09:35 because he is getting older as a, and he should be taller than he is.
01:09:38 The people who make the show are on record saying they do not use ref sheets
01:09:43 for any of their characters, which I think is a huge mistake, and it pisses me off,
01:09:47 and I don't like it.
01:09:49 I mean, largely, largely, I don't really care.
01:09:53 Like, it doesn't bother me while I'm watching the episode, but whenever I think,
01:09:57 oh, yeah, that, that seems, I mean, that one bit where Amethyst is exactly the same height,
01:10:02 that's a bit too obvious.
01:10:04 She's a little bit taller, no matter how much taller.
01:10:07 But it, but when I reflect on it, I'm like, what an utter lack of, like,
01:10:10 professionalism and caring about your product, to just be like, I don't know.
01:10:14 I guess they're just whatever.
01:10:16 Tom, that is the white cis male in you that cares about these sorts of things.
01:10:22 We care about expressing ourselves, feeling, feeling the drawings,
01:10:26 feeling how big Steven is relative to Amethyst.
01:10:28 I need to take, I need to take this opinion back to Prager, you where it belongs.
01:10:31 As a purple female, I agree with Tom.
01:10:36 Well, there you go, there you go.
01:10:39 If a woman says it's a problem, then I can say whatever I want now.
01:10:42 I have the shield.
01:10:44 Blue Diamond is the best.
01:10:45 Here's a, here's a hot take that everyone agrees with.
01:10:48 Yellow Diamond looks like ass, and I hate how yellow her skin is.
01:10:51 She looks terrible.
01:10:51 Yellow Diamond looks better now.
01:10:55 I mean, I didn't like her initial appearance because of that crazy neck.
01:10:58 Yeah.
01:10:58 Because of that top of that neck.
01:11:00 Yeah.
01:11:00 But it's been toned down in future appearances.
01:11:03 I mean, I don't think she's anywhere near as cool as Blue Diamond.
01:11:05 If they just turned down the saturation on her skin specifically,
01:11:08 I think she would look 10 times better.
01:11:10 On her what?
01:11:11 Like on her face and skin.
01:11:12 Like, you know, if you turned that saturation down.
01:11:14 I do think they're a bit, she in particular is a bit too like one tone.
01:11:19 Yeah, exactly.
01:11:20 It's like, I agree with that.
01:11:22 That's why, that's my problem with some silk months.
01:11:24 Blue is better.
01:11:25 That's why like Reshiram and Zekrom and like Ninetales and Vulpix,
01:11:28 like they're cool and all, but they're a little too,
01:11:30 I don't mind Yellow Diamond's color palette.
01:11:34 And I think when Yellow and Blue Diamond are together,
01:11:37 they compliment each other quite well and they look good together.
01:11:40 I just don't like Yellow.
01:11:41 I think Yellow looks worse when she's on her own.
01:11:45 We've had our issues with Yellow on the show in the past.
01:11:49 Story history.
01:11:50 The cycle continues.
01:11:52 Yeah.
01:11:53 I didn't realize I still have fucking PTSD over that.
01:11:56 Yeah, you do.
01:11:57 Clearly.
01:11:57 Clearly it's manifesting here.
01:11:59 What do you think about Bismuth's redemption, such as it is?
01:12:04 Steven really just went in there and was like, hey,
01:12:07 remember when you tried to kill me?
01:12:08 Let's knock that shit off and be friends.
01:12:11 No, it's fine.
01:12:12 Because he learned something new about Rose Quartz
01:12:16 that recontextualized how he felt about the whole Bismuth thing.
01:12:19 It was fast because they cut away from the explanation,
01:12:22 but I think that was good.
01:12:22 I didn't want to hear all that explained again.
01:12:25 Yeah, for the third time.
01:12:25 Yeah.
01:12:26 Well, I mean.
01:12:27 I feel like at any time if they had unbubbled Bismuth,
01:12:31 like with all of them there and talked to her as a group,
01:12:34 I feel like they could have resolved it earlier.
01:12:38 I agree.
01:12:39 I still think, though, she might have had her reservations emotionally in Bismuth.
01:12:43 Yeah.
01:12:43 And I mean, let's not forget Steven on his own,
01:12:47 unbubbles and restores this murderous individual that attempted to kill him
01:12:52 and only barely escaped with his life.
01:12:55 It's just like he really should.
01:12:57 Like, I know if the other guys had been there,
01:12:58 they probably would have said, hey, maybe this isn't a good idea.
01:13:02 But just, I don't know.
01:13:04 I guess I'm just saying it seems like a bad idea,
01:13:06 but he is a child, so whatever.
01:13:07 Steven is a history of making bad ideas.
01:13:10 Yeah.
01:13:10 Question.
01:13:11 Does the fact that Pink Diamond was not shattered mean that no diamonds were shattered in the Earth Rebellion?
01:13:19 No.
01:13:19 Yeah.
01:13:20 Yeah, it does.
01:13:20 No diamonds.
01:13:21 But what about, no, it depends.
01:13:25 Well, there's only four.
01:13:27 Wait, what do you say, Mage?
01:13:28 No, wait, you said diamonds, right?
01:13:30 No, I made any gems.
01:13:32 Yeah, I was talking about gems in general.
01:13:34 Pearl has mentioned the friends who were shattered.
01:13:38 It's been mentioned.
01:13:39 Guys, we literally have the cluster, which is made out of shards of gems.
01:13:43 That's true.
01:13:44 Well, was that made from any more?
01:13:46 Mage is the only one on top of the Steven Universe one.
01:13:48 Well, no, I mean, hang on.
01:13:49 Wasn't the cluster put there?
01:13:50 The Steven Universe averse.
01:13:51 The cluster was specifically put there before the war, because that was like how they were going to colonize the place.
01:13:57 Well, okay, in the beginning of the few seasons, they were gathering shards of gems as well to bubble them,
01:14:03 like the remnants, the remains of their friends as well.
01:14:06 Well, some of those were corrupted specifically, right?
01:14:09 Yeah, but some of them were shards.
01:14:10 I think like in the episode where the little shards possessed like the pants, there was only a fraction of a gem.
01:14:17 I think you're right about that.
01:14:19 Yeah, yeah.
01:14:19 And I think when Bismuth came back, she looked up and saw like shattered fragments of her friends.
01:14:27 I think she mentioned like bubble because otherwise they would have like unbubbled them as well.
01:14:33 It was pretty cool when the ground cracked and like other fucking ghost cloud came out.
01:14:40 Oh, let's talk about that.
01:14:41 The Lord of Ghosts.
01:14:43 Okay, all right.
01:14:44 Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down.
01:14:46 The cluster.
01:14:47 Let's talk about the cluster.
01:14:48 Because am I the only one who was peeved?
01:14:50 The heavy pee.
01:14:51 I was peeved though.
01:14:52 The cluster is very ava.
01:14:53 That it didn't like, so the cluster comes alive, the thing that we've all been trying to avoid,
01:14:59 and it simply was not a problem and was in fact a great boon.
01:15:04 Yeah, that was little.
01:15:06 I think the reason that that was set up is because Stephen has already solved the problem of it
01:15:11 potentially being an enemy by being a nice friend and saying, don't worry, you freak.
01:15:18 I'm your friend.
01:15:19 I mean, that is true.
01:15:19 I'll give you a bubble and now you'll have no nightmares and they're like cool sick.
01:15:25 I guess it's the same way as Bismuth that like they probably could have unbubbled it
01:15:29 and it would have been all right.
01:15:30 But yeah, no, no.
01:15:31 Like at the end though, at the end, yeah, I think it did.
01:15:35 I don't remember specifically in that episode, but I think the bubbling kind of helps it to
01:15:39 keep calm and at the end when it helped was like, okay, do you want to go back into your bubble?
01:15:45 I think that's what Stephen said or something like that.
01:15:47 You're right about that.
01:15:47 But he distinctly like we see the bubble pop when it is like coming out and he doesn't like
01:15:53 reform the bubble or anything.
01:15:54 Yeah, we do not see him reform the bubble, but he did ask about it.
01:15:57 He did ask.
01:15:58 So I guess he's going to later.
01:16:00 Is he going to drill down to the center of the earth again like they did previously?
01:16:04 Is that the plan?
01:16:04 He's just going to do it with mind bubbling.
01:16:06 You can't do that.
01:16:07 That's not a thing.
01:16:08 He's going to bubble the entire.
01:16:12 He can pull that power right out of his hand.
01:16:14 Okay, guys, one, there's already a giant hole leading to the cluster that the cluster made
01:16:19 itself.
01:16:19 Second, Stephen has floating power, so he could just probably just float down the bubble.
01:16:23 Well, Stephen distinctly says, what about oxygen levels?
01:16:27 I mean, he can dive.
01:16:28 I mean, if the cluster, he can make a bubble around himself.
01:16:30 He can survive in space.
01:16:31 He can survive in space.
01:16:32 Well, he does need to breathe.
01:16:33 I refute that by disagreeing.
01:16:37 Okay, Stephen specifically says, he specifically says to the cluster as it's retreating, like,
01:16:42 do you want to go back in your bubble?
01:16:44 Now, to me, the implication was, oh, the bubble isn't popped.
01:16:48 We, like, poked through the bubble with our little arm here, which would just make no
01:16:53 sense at all.
01:16:53 It seemed like the bubble popped.
01:16:55 And we saw an explosion.
01:16:57 So, I don't know.
01:16:59 I think he meant to re-bubble it, but, you know, that was.
01:17:03 I mean, maybe he just did something.
01:17:06 And maybe he just meant, like, do you want to go back into your shell?
01:17:10 Like, do you want to just be alone for a while, buddy?
01:17:13 Okay, I'll talk to you later.
01:17:14 Wouldn't a fucking giant cluster going from the core of the Earth all the way to the surface,
01:17:19 like, cause damage significantly to the planet?
01:17:22 No.
01:17:23 No.
01:17:24 Okay, to be fair, the Earth in Steven Universe is already massively fucked by, like, even
01:17:30 having the cluster to begin with.
01:17:31 So, I guess it's just, like, different.
01:17:33 I was like, there's certain man masses missing in Steven Universe.
01:17:38 Yeah, there is no center of the Earth.
01:17:40 There is just the cluster.
01:17:41 Did that arm extend all the way from the center of the planet?
01:17:45 I mean, it must have, right?
01:17:46 Well, for, I mean, for fuck's sake.
01:17:49 Like, that's, like, I don't know how many miles that is, but that's like a lot,
01:17:53 it's like, it's probably like thousands of miles to the center.
01:17:55 And, but then, like, it gets up and the arm itself is like, you know,
01:17:59 you know, maybe like mountain-sized, like.
01:18:02 If you think about it, okay, I mean, well, I think, like, the United States is like a
01:18:05 thousand miles across, I think, or maybe a couple thousand.
01:18:08 I think it's more, yeah.
01:18:10 Okay, you know what, whatever.
01:18:11 So, it was definitely thousands of miles, like, to the center of the Earth, probably.
01:18:15 I mean, it's a lot longer than the arm that we see.
01:18:19 Yeah.
01:18:19 So, I guess it's just a weird coincidence that the size of the arm that emerges from the Earth,
01:18:24 of what is left to emerge from the Earth is just the same exact size.
01:18:28 Yeah, I think they just decided not to go further than that, for some reason.
01:18:33 I mean, I mean, it worked out, you know, that was an appropriate length to form.
01:18:35 Yeah, maybe it just decided to match the other two, but like, why not be bigger?
01:18:39 Because we had to have this cool arm wrestling scene.
01:18:41 It was this fucking sick shit, dude.
01:18:45 The rule of cool.
01:18:46 You make comics, you know it.
01:18:49 I, yeah, I get it.
01:18:50 I mean, it was kind of cool.
01:18:51 I like this, I like the ships.
01:18:53 I didn't really like the weird arm cluster, but whatever.
01:18:57 It looked like a muscle.
01:18:57 It looked like muscles.
01:18:58 It was, it was theming.
01:18:59 It was organic.
01:19:01 It represented the Earth.
01:19:01 How was that theming?
01:19:02 Because it represented the organic nature of Earth versus the clean.
01:19:07 Oh, so it's incomplete, it's raw, it's bro, it's damaged.
01:19:12 It's raw, it's mean.
01:19:14 The cluster is hashtag our boy now.
01:19:18 I mean, that's true.
01:19:19 Yeah, it is, it is.
01:19:20 I always, I still, I think I remember saying this in the previous Steven Universe podcast,
01:19:26 but I want to see what happens when the cluster fuses with someone.
01:19:29 Oh, that's.
01:19:30 Specifically see, Steven.
01:19:31 Becomes God.
01:19:32 Steven fuses with the cluster to fight white diamond or something.
01:19:37 He becomes like a giant, like big boy.
01:19:39 No, the thing is.
01:19:40 How convenient.
01:19:41 The big bad is white diamond.
01:19:43 Oh, yeah.
01:19:44 Of course.
01:19:45 Now, until we learn of the secret overlord, black diamond, which will be, you know, truly, truly powerful.
01:19:51 I want there to be a black diamond.
01:19:53 I mean, that sounds cool, you know.
01:19:55 Black and red diamond.
01:19:56 Black and red diamond.
01:19:57 Black diamond.
01:19:59 Uh, I want to learn lore about where the diamonds came from.
01:20:03 Well, then I can make actual gems like on earth.
01:20:05 Oh, yeah.
01:20:05 Yeah.
01:20:06 Yeah.
01:20:06 Oh, you Google it.
01:20:07 You see.
01:20:09 Wait, what is this?
01:20:09 I can't go over right now.
01:20:11 Oh, okay.
01:20:11 Are you asking if on earth there are black or red diamonds?
01:20:13 Yeah, there is.
01:20:14 There is such a thing as a black diamond.
01:20:15 A black diamond.
01:20:16 Okay.
01:20:16 Yeah.
01:20:16 I was just, just making sure.
01:20:19 What about a, what about a trans diamond?
01:20:21 What about a gay diamond?
01:20:23 We need inclusion.
01:20:24 No, black diamonds, black diamonds only exists on ski slopes.
01:20:28 For when you gotta be the old champion skier.
01:20:31 Black diamond is just a skiing champ.
01:20:33 It's, it looks almost chrome.
01:20:36 Well, fair enough.
01:20:38 I can't, I'm, I'm finding Google images,
01:20:39 but they all seem fake and dumb.
01:20:41 Hey, here's a thought.
01:20:42 I'm pretty sure.
01:20:43 It doesn't mean anything.
01:20:43 But remember how the, how, uh,
01:20:46 Peridot showed up in a giant green hand?
01:20:49 Is there a, is there a green diamond out there somewhere?
01:20:51 I mean, there was a blue and a, you know, yellow.
01:20:53 It is.
01:20:54 Yeah, yeah.
01:20:54 I was thinking about that.
01:20:55 It's a hand as opposed to an arm.
01:20:58 So I guess that like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:21:01 Peridot showed up in a hand and the diamonds show up in arms,
01:21:04 but like the hand seemed like bigger.
01:21:07 Well, the hand seemed about the same size
01:21:11 as the, as the hand of the arm.
01:21:14 Sizes are a little bit weird in Steven.
01:21:16 I guess I can, I don't know.
01:21:18 I really was hoping.
01:21:19 Does each of these arms just command a fleet of hands?
01:21:22 I don't know.
01:21:22 I don't know.
01:21:23 Um, I like it.
01:21:24 Okay.
01:21:25 Guys, color theory, blue plus yellow equals green.
01:21:29 Wow.
01:21:30 Yeah.
01:21:30 Did you go to art school or something?
01:21:32 Pretty impressive.
01:21:33 Well, and what does the theory consist of?
01:21:36 It's just like, I think that the implication might have been
01:21:40 that like Peridot is just, you know,
01:21:41 subservient to both of the diamonds, even though,
01:21:43 I mean, she's definitely yellows, but.
01:21:45 Yeah, Peridot is yellows, man.
01:21:47 But like, they work together, like blue and yellow.
01:21:50 So.
01:21:51 It is strange and makes me wonder if there's some kind,
01:21:54 if the green is some, like, I mean,
01:21:57 there's only two things that make sense.
01:21:58 And one is that the green is like some kind of coalition,
01:22:02 like blue and yellow coalition color,
01:22:04 or that this ship was made specifically for Peridot,
01:22:08 or maybe for Peridot's plural.
01:22:10 I mean, that's probably, I guess, what it is.
01:22:12 I mean, you know, Peridot wasn't special at the time.
01:22:14 They probably send Peridots on these kind of missions
01:22:16 elsewhere as well.
01:22:17 I think, I think if we're thinking of color theory,
01:22:21 if we're thinking of color theory,
01:22:24 we've got yellow, blue, and pink, which is like the red,
01:22:28 which is like the three primary colors.
01:22:30 So I don't know whether there would be any other diamonds
01:22:33 aside from white diamond that are secret.
01:22:35 I mean, I'm assuming not.
01:22:36 I'm assuming not.
01:22:37 By the way, guys, here's a conspiracy theory
01:22:40 that a lot of people are bringing up that I think makes no sense,
01:22:43 but you can weigh in on.
01:22:45 There was, there, remember that, remember that time,
01:22:47 when Greg, Steven, and Pearl went to the city,
01:22:51 and that's when Pearl sang her song about Rose being gone,
01:22:57 and she kind of got over her hatred of Greg.
01:22:59 With the top hat.
01:22:59 With the top hat.
01:23:00 That's the one.
01:23:01 That's the one.
01:23:01 Yeah, yeah.
01:23:02 So in that song, Greg is depicted as yellow,
01:23:06 and Pearl is depicted as blue.
01:23:09 And people are making connections to blue and yellow diamond.
01:23:15 I see zero connection here other than Pearl was sad about stuff,
01:23:19 like blue.
01:23:20 What kind of connections are being made?
01:23:22 I have not even paid attention to what they are.
01:23:25 I mean, secretly Greg is yellow diamond.
01:23:29 How would Greg even be yellow diamond in any way?
01:23:31 It's because Greg represents-
01:23:32 No, dude.
01:23:32 The white, he went into the house.
01:23:34 He went into the house, and he hid,
01:23:35 and he came out as yellow diamond,
01:23:37 like the ends, as you've seen them together.
01:23:39 It's in the same room.
01:23:41 Yellow diamond represents toxic masculinity,
01:23:43 which Greg is the human embodiment of,
01:23:46 and that's how he stole Rose with his toxic masculinity.
01:23:49 Yeah, you're right.
01:23:50 You're right.
01:23:51 Of course I'm right.
01:23:53 I'm sold.
01:23:54 I'm sold.
01:23:56 I can't wait for white to be the only male gem.
01:23:59 That would be interesting.
01:24:02 That would actually be kind of cool and neat.
01:24:05 It would literally be the patriarchy, is what that would be.
01:24:08 Yeah, I mean, it would be.
01:24:09 At least they'd be honest about it.
01:24:11 Yeah, it won't be.
01:24:12 Like on the surface.
01:24:13 Men are banned.
01:24:14 It will never stop frustrating me that the gems are all female,
01:24:18 because if everyone is female, then no one is.
01:24:21 It doesn't even make sense for gems to have a gender at all.
01:24:24 It's just an artistic choice, really.
01:24:26 Yeah.
01:24:26 I mean, okay, I guess gender is performed.
01:24:31 I don't know, whatever.
01:24:32 Right, right.
01:24:33 What does that even mean in a world where nobody has sex?
01:24:37 But they all have girlish forms.
01:24:39 Well, look at Ruby before example.
01:24:41 Ruby is very real.
01:24:44 Also proper amethysts, as well.
01:24:46 Yeah, look at what's her face.
01:24:49 Tansanite?
01:24:50 No.
01:24:51 Who's the orange one?
01:24:52 I can't remember.
01:24:53 Jasper.
01:24:54 Yeah, Jasper.
01:24:55 Jasper's very good.
01:24:55 Where the fuck is she?
01:24:56 What the heck happened?
01:24:58 I mean, we've been told they're all female.
01:25:01 Yeah, they're all female, but like, I don't know.
01:25:05 It rings a bit hollow when you think about it.
01:25:08 It's like, well, technically, they're not even female.
01:25:13 They're genderless, but they use female pronouns.
01:25:15 But like, why would they even use female pronouns in a society
01:25:19 where there is no such thing as male or female?
01:25:20 Well, they have to have some sort of pronouns,
01:25:23 and I guess it's easy for the watchers to have.
01:25:26 For some reason, the gems speak English, and in English,
01:25:29 you have to have a pronoun.
01:25:30 Well, yeah, that's the real reason.
01:25:32 I guess that's very wrong.
01:25:33 No, you don't.
01:25:35 You don't have to have pronouns if you don't want to.
01:25:37 Well, I think Rebecca Sugar just wanted to make them female,
01:25:41 and so she came up with reasons.
01:25:42 Well, sure.
01:25:43 I mean, yeah.
01:25:43 They just want the porn.
01:25:45 They want the porn, they want the Rule 34, and so do I.
01:25:48 But in the universe, I don't know, when it's like,
01:25:50 all the gems are female, my question is,
01:25:52 but what does that mean, really?
01:25:54 Like, what does it, what does that mean?
01:25:55 Rule 34 is what it means.
01:25:57 In some cases, I think it makes more sense than others.
01:26:00 Yeah, I don't know.
01:26:01 It's a stylistic choice.
01:26:02 I don't know.
01:26:02 It's fine.
01:26:03 It's fine.
01:26:06 This is why I wonder, and this is why you gotta ask the deep questions.
01:26:09 Like, is Sapphire and Ruby's marriage really a gay wedding?
01:26:12 Nobody knows.
01:26:13 Nobody knows.
01:26:14 Nobody knows.
01:26:15 Scholars debate for it endlessly.
01:26:18 It's a very funny wedding.
01:26:20 Kind of genderless and just reproducing.
01:26:22 I mean, if you just saw a really sexy starfish,
01:26:25 starfish are genderless, but like, if it looked kind of feminine.
01:26:28 Patrick.
01:26:29 Would you call it like, like Patrick?
01:26:32 Just because Patrick has a rockin' bod,
01:26:34 it does not make him female, you know?
01:26:37 Yeah.
01:26:37 Nor does it make him male.
01:26:38 Rule 34, Patrick Star.
01:26:40 Oh, God.
01:26:41 Yes, this is good.
01:26:44 Hey, well, who's your favorite gem?
01:26:47 Mine was Ruby for a long time.
01:26:49 I think I'm back on Pearl.
01:26:50 I think I'm back on Pearl.
01:26:51 I-
01:26:51 Mine was Pearl for a while, but I think Amethyst.
01:26:53 I think Garnet has always been a favorite,
01:26:56 but Lapis Lazuli is second.
01:26:59 I have been thinking since the beginning of this podcast,
01:27:02 when I couldn't decide on what gem I liked the most.
01:27:06 And I think I still can't decide.
01:27:11 But maybe it's Lyon.
01:27:14 Lyon's not a gem, but he thinks it's funny.
01:27:18 My favorite gem is the gem that I made for the last even podcast,
01:27:21 Stibnite, sweet precious Stibnite.
01:27:22 Oh yeah, my favorite gem is me, Aquamarine.
01:27:26 I miss, what's his face?
01:27:27 Mexican, whatever the fuck his name was.
01:27:30 The fusion guy.
01:27:30 Whoa, God, yeah.
01:27:31 Remember that guy?
01:27:32 Is it Mexican cherry opal or fire opal?
01:27:34 No.
01:27:35 Something like, I'm gonna Google it.
01:27:36 I'm gonna Google it.
01:27:37 I think it was Mexican cherry opal.
01:27:38 I think you're right.
01:27:39 I think it was a fusion of two, you know,
01:27:42 whatever's, and that was cool.
01:27:44 Mexican cherry opal.
01:27:46 Yeah, it was awesome.
01:27:48 It's like everyone on Homeworld is like,
01:27:50 what is a Mexican?
01:27:52 What does your name mean?
01:27:53 And I'm like, stop misgendering me.
01:27:58 Even on Homeworld, they need to build the wall.
01:28:02 Yeah, that's right.
01:28:05 May I choose your favorite gem?
01:28:06 I'm gonna find my old image.
01:28:08 Where is my funny guy?
01:28:09 Oh, you're your little, it's on my butt guy.
01:28:12 Yeah.
01:28:12 Right?
01:28:13 Where is he?
01:28:14 Oh, I don't think I have it.
01:28:15 I mean, if you look at the PCP, Steven Universe,
01:28:18 like we did edit them into the opening of that episode.
01:28:21 We did.
01:28:21 They are all there?
01:28:22 Yeah.
01:28:22 Here, I'll link for your pleasure, you know,
01:28:24 which is people in this gem.
01:28:25 Mexican cherry opal.
01:28:26 Mexican, all right, thank you, thank you.
01:28:27 Yep.
01:28:29 They're all here.
01:28:29 I mean, it was me, Jesse, Gib, Tom, and Ben.
01:28:31 Why is it Mexican?
01:28:33 Well, that's just the name of the opal,
01:28:34 and it was so silly that I was like, well, that works.
01:28:36 You know, it's funny.
01:28:38 I'm laughing.
01:28:38 Help me giggling.
01:28:40 Yeah, I've had a good, I've had a good chuckle.
01:28:43 Uh, oh, Mage can't hear us, but that's her problem.
01:28:47 Where'd she go?
01:28:48 I think she's just having audio issues.
01:28:49 Oh, no.
01:28:50 Fuck, and I'm...
01:28:51 Well, I don't know.
01:28:52 She'll, she can read, I mean, we're all doing the right thing
01:28:54 in this call.
01:28:55 Hopefully she can.
01:28:55 You are, you are not the first person
01:28:57 to make a Mexican cherry opal fan.
01:28:59 What?
01:29:00 A gem sona.
01:29:00 Are you kidding me?
01:29:01 Well, actually, actually, that's,
01:29:02 I don't know if who's came first.
01:29:04 I found one.
01:29:06 Let me, let me see.
01:29:06 This was January 10th, 2016,
01:29:09 is when this episode came out.
01:29:10 Okay, let's find out.
01:29:11 Let's find out.
01:29:12 I need to know so bad.
01:29:15 See this one?
01:29:16 Wait, there's several actually.
01:29:17 What the fuck?
01:29:19 What the fuck?
01:29:20 Why would anyone else have such a retarded idea?
01:29:23 Um, because they're fellow scholars,
01:29:25 such as myself.
01:29:27 All right.
01:29:29 Oh, I heard you, Mage.
01:29:30 What are you saying?
01:29:31 Yeah, nothing.
01:29:32 I couldn't hear you guys for a prolonged time.
01:29:35 Yes.
01:29:35 You missed.
01:29:36 We would just talk about our gem sonas.
01:29:38 Oh, I have a gem sona.
01:29:40 I almost missed this.
01:29:42 What is it?
01:29:43 How do I find out when a tumblr post was made?
01:29:45 Is there no date on the post?
01:29:47 Oh, wait, this was,
01:29:48 this was July 23rd, 2017.
01:29:50 Ha, I win.
01:29:51 It looks like you beat,
01:29:51 looks like, yeah, okay, okay.
01:29:53 Yep, yep, yep.
01:29:53 Okay, what's the contest for?
01:29:56 I'm looking, I'm looking at other people
01:29:59 that have made Mexican cherry opal gem sonas.
01:30:02 As was mine.
01:30:02 Whether Bestie Boyz here was the first.
01:30:06 Can I see Mexican cherry opal?
01:30:08 Can you say it?
01:30:09 Can you, can I see it?
01:30:11 Oh, if you click the piece,
01:30:13 the Steven Universe,
01:30:14 just click play on that in the main chat.
01:30:15 It's like, he's the first guy that shows up.
01:30:18 We all made gem sonas for that episode.
01:30:21 Remember when I used to make like effort
01:30:23 in like the openings of these episodes?
01:30:25 Yeah, no more, no more of that.
01:30:26 This is, this is July 23rd, 2017.
01:30:29 I'm still in the lead.
01:30:31 No one can beat me.
01:30:33 I mean, Jesse had a tiger's eye.
01:30:35 I would bet there's some tiger's eye
01:30:37 that go back a ways.
01:30:38 Tiger's eye, tiger's eye is canon in the show now.
01:30:40 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:30:41 Oh, fuck, that's right.
01:30:42 Fismith said it, yeah.
01:30:44 Isn't that like an actual crystal gem,
01:30:46 tiger's eye or whatever?
01:30:47 It was like one of their friends or something, right?
01:30:50 Apparently it sounded like it.
01:30:50 That's what they said, what's her name was saying,
01:30:53 but like, yeah, that was like one of their buddies.
01:30:55 So this monstrosity is in fact canon as fuck.
01:30:59 This misshapen freak.
01:31:00 This is actually the corrupted version,
01:31:02 canonically, of tiger's eye.
01:31:05 It looks like Jesse's OC.
01:31:06 Well, this one, this one says it was one year ago.
01:31:09 So I don't know if that might be rounding down.
01:31:11 So this one, I can't tell.
01:31:13 Okay.
01:31:13 But it's really bad and seems to be colored with colored pencils.
01:31:16 Oh, well discussed.
01:31:17 Disregarded.
01:31:18 Anyone who's interested, please Google Mexican Cherry Opal.
01:31:21 Yeah, let us know.
01:31:22 Mexican Cherry Opal and actually a disproportionate amount
01:31:27 of the results are in fact gemstones.
01:31:29 What, are you kidding?
01:31:30 Oh, I'm going to Google this shit now.
01:31:33 We're getting lost over here.
01:31:34 Pretty shocked actually.
01:31:36 You know, this is a rabbit hole, I'm glad.
01:31:38 There actually are quite a few.
01:31:40 This is shocking.
01:31:42 Well, I see just some normal Cherry Opals as well.
01:31:44 In fact, I see way more Cherry Opals.
01:31:47 That's true.
01:31:48 That's true.
01:31:49 Okay.
01:31:49 Oh my God, this one has a gun.
01:31:50 Whoa.
01:31:52 This one just has a gun.
01:31:54 All right.
01:31:54 All right.
01:31:55 This is not good podcast content.
01:31:57 Let's see.
01:31:57 What is it?
01:31:59 There's, they can't see the images.
01:32:01 Fine.
01:32:03 Let's fucking Google it.
01:32:05 Yeah, just Google.
01:32:06 Everyone, kids, kids at home.
01:32:08 I mean, I don't even know what more I have to say
01:32:10 on Steven Universe at the moment.
01:32:11 No, these are really good.
01:32:12 No, these are actually really good.
01:32:14 I mean, please edit them in someone, I guess.
01:32:17 I don't know.
01:32:18 I guess that's the thing to do.
01:32:19 No.
01:32:19 Google it at home.
01:32:20 Okay.
01:32:20 Just Google it and just experience what I'm experiencing.
01:32:23 Yeah, do that.
01:32:24 Do that.
01:32:24 Okay.
01:32:25 All right.
01:32:25 I'll shut up.
01:32:26 Who's got anything else to say about Steven Universe?
01:32:29 I mean, I forgot my feelings out there.
01:32:33 I really liked, I really liked the one where Ruby was a cowboy
01:32:41 and I liked the fight at the end.
01:32:43 Huh?
01:32:44 I'm sorry.
01:32:45 I think my engine has been weird at 3 a.m. in the morning.
01:32:48 Oh, yeah.
01:32:50 Well, I liked, I really liked the cowboy episode.
01:32:53 I liked the fight at the end.
01:32:57 My overall feelings about this bomb were, it was all right.
01:33:01 I liked it.
01:33:02 I'm invested again.
01:33:04 I'm cautiously optimistic because I'm almost certain
01:33:06 that the next bomb is going to not be this good.
01:33:10 It's going to be meandering again.
01:33:12 I mean, the hook that the gems are like, they know now.
01:33:17 Like everyone knows, it's pretty neat.
01:33:21 And I'm interested to see what, I am interested to see what happens next.
01:33:24 I am also interested to see what happens.
01:33:26 It does kind of feel like we're reaching like the end of the storyline.
01:33:29 I hope we are.
01:33:29 I pray and I know that we are.
01:33:31 I really hope that the next season is the last one
01:33:33 of the tie up all the loosens.
01:33:36 I like that.
01:33:36 Frankly, they've answered every question except I just want to know
01:33:40 who's white diamond and where does like gem society in general come from.
01:33:44 But even that, I don't really care.
01:33:45 I also want to know who the pink hair girl is.
01:33:49 The pink hair girl.
01:33:49 I don't, I don't care.
01:33:50 Well, she's just a girl.
01:33:51 She's just some.
01:33:52 I mean, well, they introduced her and then like they whisked her away.
01:33:55 I want to see something with her.
01:33:57 Well, all right, fair enough.
01:33:58 I would like to see her again.
01:33:59 Yeah, I do want to see her again.
01:34:02 I want, I want Pearl to smash.
01:34:03 Yeah, didn't she like give her number to Pearl or something?
01:34:06 And Pearl has been steadily learning how to use a phone.
01:34:13 I think that a fucking Pearl and Kevin love triangle sounds like great.
01:34:16 The kind of filler episode that I totally want to watch.
01:34:19 I'd like that.
01:34:20 Because some of the, some of the Steven Universe filler is good.
01:34:22 And I like it.
01:34:23 Some of it is, but, you know, onion, get, get, get at it.
01:34:28 The filler's biggest problem isn't even that it's bad.
01:34:33 Well, I was going to say the reason the problem with Steven Universe filler is
01:34:36 even that it's usually bad.
01:34:38 It's just that it's usually like we're in the middle of this really interesting plot arc,
01:34:41 but we're going to put it on pause for like the rest of the week.
01:34:45 And then you're not going to know how it turns out for another like month and a half.
01:34:48 The week for the rest of the six months.
01:34:51 You have a Steven bomb.
01:34:51 Right.
01:34:52 Exactly.
01:34:52 And it's like a string of episodes you don't care about.
01:34:55 And then something right at the end.
01:34:56 That's why it's so inferior.
01:34:57 With like a weird new thing.
01:34:59 And I'm like, well, fuck you.
01:35:01 Remember that episode where, am I wrong about this?
01:35:04 Where Sadie, Lars and Steven get trapped on an island and then Sadie,
01:35:08 the angel herself, like just doesn't tell them how to get home.
01:35:12 Remember that?
01:35:13 That does happen.
01:35:14 Why is she like good?
01:35:16 Like she did, that's fucked up.
01:35:18 Why are we like okay with that?
01:35:19 She did that.
01:35:22 Because of her feeling.
01:35:23 She literally kidnapped two people.
01:35:26 She kidnapped them is what she did.
01:35:27 Because women get away with everything.
01:35:29 Come on.
01:35:30 Well, I guess so.
01:35:32 She was she was upset.
01:35:33 She was upset.
01:35:34 So everything is justified.
01:35:36 Okay, guys, this is this is hilarious.
01:35:38 A double standard kind of.
01:35:39 I mean, it's not about the same people.
01:35:40 But like recently I was watching TV like a pub.
01:35:44 And I saw we bear bears episode where like there were two people
01:35:47 stranded on an island.
01:35:48 And you know, the little bears washed up.
01:35:51 They were children at that time.
01:35:52 And like the two people was a guy and a girl.
01:35:56 And the guy he had like provisions and like a raft and stuff hidden from her.
01:36:01 A way to escape.
01:36:02 And he was vilified in the episode.
01:36:04 Poor hiding.
01:36:05 As he should be.
01:36:06 As she should be.
01:36:07 As should Sadie for being a bad person.
01:36:10 The reason he hid it because he liked the girl and he was like,
01:36:14 Oh, we're going to.
01:36:15 That's literal rate mage.
01:36:16 That's literally rape.
01:36:17 I was like, I'm going to reveal it as soon as she falls in love with me.
01:36:21 And it's like, I don't remember the episode with Sadie and Lars, but wasn't like.
01:36:25 That is pretty much the same thing.
01:36:27 It's not too dissimilar.
01:36:29 Yeah, I guess.
01:36:29 She she just love being falling in love.
01:36:31 It's like, like she was enjoying him to a pilot.
01:36:34 Was she waiting for him to apologize?
01:36:35 No, no, no, no.
01:36:36 She was just enjoying being trapped in a place with the guy she's into.
01:36:39 And so she was like, that's it.
01:36:41 That's all it was.
01:36:42 It's like the same shit.
01:36:43 And when he finds out he fucking flipped shit as he should.
01:36:46 Not enough though.
01:36:48 Not enough.
01:36:49 It was all just because she was like, she was like feeling underappreciated or something.
01:36:53 So yeah, that means okay to kidnap someone.
01:36:55 That's why I like as like, it feels so good to know that like as a father,
01:37:00 like when I have kids and like my wife gets custody once we inevitably divorce,
01:37:04 when I go and just take them from the house, that'll be allowed.
01:37:07 Like no one will stop me.
01:37:08 That'll be great.
01:37:09 I really look forward to this.
01:37:10 I can see you defending yourself as you would.
01:37:12 You would not hire a lawyer in court.
01:37:13 I'll bring up this Steven Universe episode.
01:37:15 Look.
01:37:15 I'd like to admit Steven Universe into evidence, please.
01:37:21 And then the judge will pull off her wig and reveal that she's got like a bright teal
01:37:29 side cut like Tumblr do.
01:37:31 No.
01:37:31 And she like cased his smiths.
01:37:33 It is in fact Rebecca Sugar, my judge and jury.
01:37:40 Are we done?
01:37:41 I feel like we're pretty exhausted here.
01:37:44 I am extra exhausted.
01:37:46 Yeah, I'm sure that's true.
01:37:48 I feel like we've really run Steven Universe into the grave.
01:37:51 Well, hey, we didn't.
01:37:52 Well, you didn't mention a mage's lovely OC over here.
01:37:56 Spirit courts looking good.
01:37:58 Looking good.
01:37:58 I do want to mention that I am a little disappointed that Sadie's music career did
01:38:03 not get brought up.
01:38:04 That is a side plot that I'm kind of invested in.
01:38:06 I, yeah.
01:38:07 I mean, I'm interested to see where that goes.
01:38:09 I don't think it'll go anywhere fast.
01:38:09 It's going to be brought up again, I'm sure.
01:38:12 There was a little bit where they showed like the people in the town reacting to something
01:38:19 and you could see Sadie hanging out with everyone.
01:38:22 That's good.
01:38:22 And Mayor Dewey at the donut show.
01:38:25 I'm glad that she has quit.
01:38:26 I'm like that she's done that.
01:38:28 I remembered.
01:38:29 I just remembered something neat.
01:38:31 And I don't know if this is true, but I'm pretty sure this is the deal.
01:38:35 When Ruby writes her goodbye note, she's her name.
01:38:39 Like she writes Ruby, but before Ruby, there's like a little crossed outfit.
01:38:43 I think what that is is that she started to write Garnet.
01:38:46 And then remember that she's not Garnet.
01:38:48 Yeah.
01:38:49 I think so.
01:38:49 Yeah.
01:38:49 And I thought, yeah.
01:38:50 I paused and went back.
01:38:52 I couldn't see a G. It just looked like a little scribble, but I was like, it's gotta be.
01:38:56 It's gotta be.
01:38:57 Perhaps she's just retarded.
01:39:00 She just wanted to.
01:39:01 She just doesn't know how to write.
01:39:02 She just doesn't know words.
01:39:02 No, no.
01:39:04 It can't be.
01:39:06 Mage, Mage.
01:39:06 I have a quick query about your RC.
01:39:09 Where is her gem?
01:39:11 Is it her hairband?
01:39:11 Is that what it is?
01:39:12 No, no, no, no.
01:39:13 Her thumbs.
01:39:14 She is a fusion and both of her thumbs are her gems.
01:39:16 Oh, I see.
01:39:17 Okay.
01:39:17 Okay.
01:39:18 That's cool.
01:39:18 That's cool.
01:39:19 And also the eyebrows are actually a pair of tiny eyes.
01:39:23 Oh, that's kind of cool, actually.
01:39:25 I like that.
01:39:26 Yeah.
01:39:26 That's good.
01:39:26 I like that.
01:39:27 That's like, I don't know.
01:39:28 They remind me of like Geisha eyebrows a little bit.
01:39:30 Yeah, they're whatever.
01:39:31 They're cool.
01:39:31 They're cool.
01:39:32 Geisha.
01:39:33 You said it, sister.
01:39:35 The rest of us already have those series from the last episode.
01:39:38 Yes, Stibnite.
01:39:39 Stibnite.
01:39:40 Stibnite's good.
01:39:41 Go watch that episode if you want to see those guys in an animated little intro at the beginning.
01:39:45 I mean, it's not much, but it's something.
01:39:48 All right.
01:39:48 Well, I guess we're done.
01:39:49 Anything else?
01:39:50 Anything else?
01:39:51 Steven Universe?
01:39:52 Are we going on the questions?
01:39:53 Is that what we do now?
01:39:53 Well, before questions, we have an announcement, everybody.
01:39:56 We have an announcement.
01:39:57 Uh, so the fan art, I think, is the next thing.
01:40:01 But due to massive backlash on all-
01:40:06 On all sides, Ben.
01:40:08 We've decided that it just doesn't really seem like we want to do fan art in the show.
01:40:12 So we're we're planning to retire.
01:40:14 It's it's weird to do it in an audio podcast.
01:40:18 Yeah, yeah.
01:40:20 We just want to keep, I guess, that stuff to, you know, at most a show note sort of thing.
01:40:25 Well, we might feature it elsewhere.
01:40:27 Yeah.
01:40:28 I mean, I don't know.
01:40:29 Let us know what you think.
01:40:30 Well, we always feature fan art that is tweeted at us.
01:40:33 Oh, yeah.
01:40:33 We'll happily retweet them all day.
01:40:36 Those are great.
01:40:36 We love those.
01:40:37 And here's your warning.
01:40:38 So because you didn't have warning for this, what we're going to do is,
01:40:42 like, this is your warning.
01:40:43 Next time is the last one is what we're doing.
01:40:46 So, you know, you got one more chance.
01:40:49 If you still want to make something, feel free.
01:40:51 It'll be in there.
01:40:52 If you still want to make something yourself.
01:40:53 I mean, yeah, you still got a chance to hit the spotlight.
01:40:56 Maybe this will want to be a contender.
01:40:58 Maybe this will drive up massive amounts of fan art because people know.
01:41:01 Like, it's now or never.
01:41:02 It's now or never.
01:41:03 Yeah.
01:41:04 We should do that every single time.
01:41:05 That was the plan for the entire podcast.
01:41:07 Yeah.
01:41:08 That's what it'll be.
01:41:09 So, oh, but speaking of which, let's go look at the fan
01:41:13 chart of the week.
01:41:15 All right.
01:41:16 Everyone go to the fucking fan art thing over there, the fan chart thing.
01:41:21 First one.
01:41:21 First one is from at HH Minaj.
01:41:25 It's me and Ben.
01:41:27 Oh, yes.
01:41:27 It's me and you.
01:41:28 It's the bros.
01:41:30 What does he say?
01:41:31 He says, it's also ugly and best guy ever.
01:41:33 Here are the two best brothers as the true best brothers.
01:41:36 Yes.
01:41:36 And that's clever wordplay.
01:41:38 Wow.
01:41:40 I want to do them rest in time, but procrastination doesn't let me do it.
01:41:43 Hashtag max revive t-bat.
01:41:44 I fucking love this.
01:41:45 It's great.
01:41:46 And a 10 out of 10.
01:41:47 Yeah.
01:41:48 Well, you're describing it for audio listeners.
01:41:50 It's just me as Sanji from One Piece and Ben as Zorro.
01:41:54 There you go.
01:41:55 Just works really good with my fucking hat because he wears, he wore a hat for a while.
01:42:01 I didn't even notice the poobah on the sheath.
01:42:04 On the sheath thing.
01:42:04 Yes, the little poobah, I don't know what you would call it.
01:42:08 Charm?
01:42:09 I guess.
01:42:09 Charm.
01:42:10 Yeah.
01:42:11 Katana Decoro.
01:42:13 Massive problem, though, that seems like it'd be unwieldy as he's walking around
01:42:18 because those things will jostle, that Charm will be flying off in no time.
01:42:22 What I would have done is put a poobah hanging from his ear, or perhaps three poobahs, you know.
01:42:27 That would be way too small to see.
01:42:29 Well, you know, put a little microscope.
01:42:31 My eyes, my eyes are so small and beady.
01:42:34 I look so, I look so guarded and sinister.
01:42:37 Just like in real life.
01:42:38 Yeah.
01:42:39 That's true, that's true.
01:42:41 And I look very confident and proud.
01:42:42 Quickly before we move on to the next fanart, I just quickly want to say thank you for the
01:42:46 fanarts that were featured in the last episode that were for me.
01:42:49 You guys did a bad job at saying that they were nice and I like them and they're good and thank you.
01:42:57 Well, I'm not you, I'm not going to speak for me.
01:42:59 Fair enough.
01:43:00 Fair enough.
01:43:01 Yeah, but you were like, I think it was bad, mostly like, oh, there it is, so there it goes.
01:43:06 Sort of.
01:43:08 Well, it was a little bit after I spent like five minutes like trying to scroll through the chat
01:43:12 and looking at it, and then by the time I found it, I was in because it was a funny
01:43:16 punchline that you had seen it before and is like, oh, whatever.
01:43:20 Well, I did like the editing, but yeah.
01:43:23 No, no, no, the first two.
01:43:24 I didn't see that part yet.
01:43:25 The first two images that you showed were of me and you dismissed them and I'm sad about it.
01:43:31 They were nice.
01:43:32 So thank you for me personally.
01:43:34 I definitely saw them.
01:43:35 And there you go.
01:43:37 And then speaking of mage fanart, next from at the Wolf Art, my boy Edward D. Al.
01:43:42 Edward D. Al.
01:43:43 Look at this incredible Tsukabon mage.
01:43:47 It is absolutely gorgeous.
01:43:48 Super good.
01:43:49 I love it so much.
01:43:51 It's fantastic.
01:43:51 The only thing that I think could have improved it
01:43:55 was if it was a bat with nails in it instead of a katana.
01:43:59 Well, no, it's Japanese though.
01:44:01 It's Japanese.
01:44:02 Yeah, he's going for a thing.
01:44:03 That's what's going for a thing.
01:44:04 There's nothing more quintessentially Japanese than a bat with nails in it.
01:44:09 It's literally a thing, isn't it?
01:44:10 I mean, it is.
01:44:12 Okay, okay.
01:44:13 But I mean, this is also a true.
01:44:14 He's going for a slightly softer form of delinquent than that, I think, which is appropriate,
01:44:18 which I love this.
01:44:19 I love this.
01:44:20 I really like the petals and the little thing with the leaf
01:44:25 in her mouth.
01:44:25 It's just all so good.
01:44:27 Isn't that like, okay.
01:44:29 I haven't seen Kill a Kill in a while, but it's sort of familiar.
01:44:33 That is a school uniform.
01:44:35 That is not a Kill a Kill.
01:44:36 Yeah, but like, I think it doesn't look kind of like the middle school uniform.
01:44:39 I guess.
01:44:40 Yeah, it's just like because the red, it just, the thing, the red one, it kind of reminded me.
01:44:44 It's the kind of school uniform that the Kill a Kill outfit is like.
01:44:48 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:44:49 What it's called.
01:44:49 Saifuku.
01:44:50 Based on.
01:44:50 It's the Saifuku.
01:44:51 Okay.
01:44:52 Right.
01:44:53 Well, in any case.
01:44:54 You know, I actually have, I actually have a couple of Shinae in my room right now.
01:44:57 Whoa.
01:44:59 Hey, remember, we actually have two.
01:45:01 I actually have two of them, so I'm stronger.
01:45:05 You should, you should put like five in each hand like Zoro did for Maximum Sword.
01:45:11 And then hold six and six in my teeth.
01:45:13 Yeah, like he did for Maximum Power.
01:45:15 Makes sense.
01:45:15 More swords is more power.
01:45:17 That's literally his reasoning as a child, and I absolutely love it.
01:45:21 All right.
01:45:22 Well, this one's great.
01:45:23 Moving on.
01:45:24 Yeah.
01:45:24 Edward D'Al is.
01:45:25 He's a legend.
01:45:26 I mean, this guy makes some high quality shit.
01:45:28 He's done really great work before.
01:45:29 For sure.
01:45:30 It's fucking sick.
01:45:31 All right, here we go.
01:45:32 Kind Overlord at Kind Overlord.
01:45:34 I mean, we got a, we got a gift here.
01:45:35 We got a gift here.
01:45:36 This guy did want, he did a gift of me earlier in the week, and then he, he busts out this,
01:45:41 this, this classic piece.
01:45:42 It's, it's the, the Radcon Arena.
01:45:44 It's the Dark Souls of Arena Shooters.
01:45:47 Radcon 3 IRL.
01:45:49 Radcon 3 Arena IRL.
01:45:51 This, this, yeah, this guy's killing it.
01:45:53 I really like the lighting, lighting effect.
01:45:55 Yeah, the lighting is nuts, the glow moving around and stuff.
01:45:57 This is so fucking cool.
01:45:59 Someone, someone, someone get this guy on a, someone get this guy on the art team of an indie game or
01:46:04 something.
01:46:04 Yeah.
01:46:05 I don't know.
01:46:05 Yeah.
01:46:06 For sure.
01:46:06 Like the whole gif looks like an indie game sort of title.
01:46:09 That's true.
01:46:10 Yeah.
01:46:10 That's true.
01:46:11 I, I particularly like, I think, uh, bottom left, uh, the hair.
01:46:17 Like the, the, the lighting on the hair is like kind of bubbly like the hair, and it's like,
01:46:21 yeah, that's, they, they, they thought about that.
01:46:23 He puts the work of his.
01:46:24 I like the little tiny, tiny strands of hair as well.
01:46:27 Yeah.
01:46:28 I know.
01:46:28 Those are nice.
01:46:29 Oh, a lot of detail.
01:46:30 A lot of love.
01:46:31 Pixel art's always great.
01:46:34 All right.
01:46:35 I mean, we got one of Munchie here.
01:46:36 Should we just skip this Munchie one?
01:46:38 I mean, it's just Munchie.
01:46:39 I mean, I don't know.
01:46:40 The guy's talking at the last episode.
01:46:41 Frankly, I'm sick of the guy.
01:46:43 Okay, no, but like, luckily, uh, there's a reflection in his, uh, glasses.
01:46:47 It could be just, yeah.
01:46:49 Like, like.
01:46:49 Oh, well, yeah, okay.
01:46:51 Is it potentially, now I'm not, I'm not too sure, but it could potentially be like the
01:46:55 setting for Red Con 3, like the house.
01:46:57 Okay, well, we might as well put this one.
01:46:59 Robert J. Lazarus one.
01:47:00 I mean, here, here it is.
01:47:01 There's Munchie.
01:47:02 So you can join the discussion now.
01:47:04 I mean, I think that's an actual painting.
01:47:06 So I'm, I think it's pretty.
01:47:07 I mean, I love this.
01:47:08 I think this is, I think maybe this is him at Red Con 2.
01:47:12 So maybe the reflection is the, is the classroom.
01:47:14 Oh, it's like the lecture.
01:47:15 That can be.
01:47:16 It might be.
01:47:17 It might be.
01:47:18 That's my best guess.
01:47:19 Right.
01:47:19 Well, feel free to clarify in the comments below.
01:47:22 This is a pretty, this is a pretty fucking good painting.
01:47:24 If that's like physical paints, like.
01:47:26 Yeah, I can see the bumpiness of it.
01:47:28 The, you know, capturing something like a reflective surface is pretty difficult.
01:47:33 And the fact that I can instantly tell that those are like mirrored shades,
01:47:36 reflecting a room is sick.
01:47:38 I like the little sort of the shape.
01:47:41 It has like a little bounce to it.
01:47:43 It's not like a flat surface on the glasses.
01:47:45 You can see the little bend.
01:47:48 The reflection of glasses would do, it's really good.
01:47:54 Yeah.
01:47:54 All right.
01:47:54 Next one.
01:47:55 Here we go.
01:47:56 Mr. Upload at XG Upload.
01:47:59 I saw this on Twitter before.
01:48:02 Yes.
01:48:03 Oh no.
01:48:05 Oh, it's a weed guy.
01:48:06 Oh no.
01:48:07 With his, with his, I mean, it does, it's not an Ava.
01:48:10 It's a Gundam, I think.
01:48:11 I mean, it's got that look.
01:48:12 It's a G with his weed Gundam.
01:48:14 Maybe this is a like G Gundam style.
01:48:15 It's definitely, it has such a G Gundam vibe.
01:48:19 Yeah.
01:48:19 Yeah.
01:48:20 Yeah.
01:48:20 I mean, um.
01:48:21 We Gundam.
01:48:22 And the perspective of it is really interesting.
01:48:26 See what I, one thing I appreciate about this is that in this,
01:48:28 this clearly takes place in New Los Angeles city,
01:48:32 AKA Neo Milwaukee, AKA the location of ratty focused cop killers.
01:48:36 And Digi is clearly a killer in this image.
01:48:38 I think you're right about that.
01:48:40 Yeah.
01:48:41 I mean, like the slime green bandana,
01:48:43 just the whole, the whole aesthetic.
01:48:44 I would have, the Gundam is purple.
01:48:45 It doesn't get more rowdy fuckers than this.
01:48:47 But he's purple.
01:48:48 But the Gundam is purple.
01:48:49 Exactly.
01:48:50 And killers own, killers own the color purple.
01:48:52 Oh, okay.
01:48:52 We copyrighted it.
01:48:53 Okay, well what about green?
01:48:55 Well, that's just slime.
01:48:56 Green is, green is fair use.
01:48:57 Green is fair use.
01:49:00 I mean, uh, you know, this isn't me, so I don't care.
01:49:03 So moving on.
01:49:04 I mean, yeah, sure.
01:49:05 I just want to, just the perspective,
01:49:07 like the, the attempt of the perspective is really neat.
01:49:10 I think.
01:49:11 The perspective is.
01:49:12 Oh, sorry.
01:49:13 Yeah, I think there's a little bit of a mistake there,
01:49:15 but I don't have the time to describe it.
01:49:18 How so, but like still the, it's really good.
01:49:21 I think that the perspective is maybe a little too intense,
01:49:25 because I think that the robot ends up looking not that big.
01:49:29 He only looks maybe about like 10 to 15 feet tall, I say.
01:49:34 You ain't wrong.
01:49:34 Which I think would be small for a Gundam.
01:49:37 I think like, well, let's actually,
01:49:39 Digi should probably be in between his legs.
01:49:42 No, no, sort of.
01:49:46 No.
01:49:51 Yeah, I think the scale is a bit,
01:49:54 the robot doesn't seem that big.
01:49:55 It's just like the way the arms,
01:49:57 especially the one closest to us, it's right hand,
01:50:01 the way the fist is sort of looking at us.
01:50:05 It implies, yeah, it implies sort of like,
01:50:08 Digi should really be like under the mech,
01:50:10 but it's also in front of it.
01:50:12 So it's a little bit odd.
01:50:13 It's possible that Digi is way closer to the camera
01:50:16 than the mech, you know.
01:50:17 But look, that's still an issue.
01:50:20 Yeah, I agree.
01:50:21 I agree.
01:50:22 The perspective is a bit.
01:50:24 We need something in the background,
01:50:25 like give us perspective in some way.
01:50:27 Well, no, no, no, no, we would like really ruin it a lot more
01:50:30 if there was a background to just like-
01:50:31 I just realized that,
01:50:34 I just realized that the things coming out of his shoulders
01:50:36 are blunt.
01:50:37 They're blunt, yeah.
01:50:38 Yeah.
01:50:38 How do you feel about that?
01:50:39 I was wondering about that.
01:50:41 Yeah, I thought they were like bat wings, but no.
01:50:43 You know what, maybe those blunts like open up
01:50:45 into big like weed leave wings,
01:50:47 and he can just soar like a gazelle of the sky.
01:50:50 I think that maybe he like, maybe,
01:50:52 maybe, okay, imagine this.
01:50:54 He puts his wrists fold back and exposed to flamethrowers.
01:50:58 Yeah, right.
01:50:58 With which he lights the two blunts.
01:51:01 Which he then like, he expands his chest cavity
01:51:04 to breathe it in, to like smoke the blunts down to his shoulders.
01:51:09 But they also serve as fuses for dynamite.
01:51:12 A round of explosives in his arm.
01:51:14 You know G Gundam, you know burning finger.
01:51:17 This would be blazing finger.
01:51:19 That's true.
01:51:19 Blazing finger.
01:51:21 Which so, just defeating his enemies in one fell swoop
01:51:24 and getting him majorly out.
01:51:29 All right, fair enough.
01:51:32 No more of this, thank you.
01:51:34 Okay, moving on.
01:51:35 At a sleepy guy, we got a little sketch
01:51:38 of child bestie boy me, young Nate in the fighting episode.
01:51:43 Mom, I'm busy.
01:51:45 What are you holding?
01:51:46 I'm holding various sticks attached to my body.
01:51:48 Oh, okay.
01:51:50 And pine cones and grenades.
01:51:52 Yeah, you know.
01:51:53 Oh, yes, from the story.
01:51:55 Yeah, from the story.
01:51:57 This art style is cute as hell.
01:51:58 Yeah, way into the style.
01:51:59 I love it.
01:52:00 I love it.
01:52:01 Yeah.
01:52:01 It's super great.
01:52:02 It's super great.
01:52:03 Wait, what was the story about sticks?
01:52:05 Oh, I mean, I just told about how like,
01:52:07 I didn't want to go to summer camp and then like,
01:52:09 like mom would come back at the end of the day
01:52:11 and I came back like decked out with many sticks and like
01:52:14 grenade pine cones as described by me in my belt.
01:52:17 And I'm like, mom, go away.
01:52:18 I'm in the middle of something now.
01:52:20 I mean, we're in a war.
01:52:21 We're in a war.
01:52:22 We're in a war.
01:52:23 You need to leave.
01:52:23 Yeah.
01:52:24 There will be casualties if you stick around and they will be you.
01:52:29 So here is captured for all time in digital scans of physical media.
01:52:36 Excellent.
01:52:37 And that's it.
01:52:38 And that's it.
01:52:38 Pretty, pretty painless, right?
01:52:39 Dear friends, pretty painless.
01:52:41 All right.
01:52:41 Here we go.
01:52:42 Moving on.
01:52:44 Oh man.
01:52:45 That was pretty good.
01:52:46 That might be the best one yet.
01:52:47 I think so.
01:52:47 I mean, that made you wise.
01:52:48 I feel, I feel extremely pain.
01:52:51 Me too.
01:52:51 Me too.
01:52:53 I sprained my ankle watching this fan out.
01:52:57 All right.
01:52:57 Here we go.
01:52:58 Moving on.
01:52:58 It's time for those PCP themes people.
01:53:00 Hey, don't forget when you're hearing this,
01:53:03 it's going to be around the fucking 13th.
01:53:06 You've got one, two.
01:53:08 Yeah, we're doing questions last, I think, right?
01:53:10 Oh, okay.
01:53:11 Yes.
01:53:12 You got three weeks left people to enter into the goddamn PCP theme contest.
01:53:17 Let's, let's see what you got.
01:53:19 Full disclosure, I have not listened to any of these.
01:53:22 So these are all going to be a surprise.
01:53:23 I probably shouldn't tell you that because then I,
01:53:25 you'll know that I don't screen these.
01:53:27 But regardless, here we go.
01:53:30 Here we go.
01:53:31 With the first one.
01:53:32 Oh, and this is by...
01:53:33 Wait, wait, wait.
01:53:33 What's the first one?
01:53:34 Okay.
01:53:35 The first one is this is from at Moe entrepreneur.
01:53:38 Listen to PCP.
01:53:40 It's immaculate on SoundCloud.
01:53:42 Okay.
01:53:42 So it's called it's PCP.
01:53:44 It's immaculate is the name of this.
01:53:46 Or is immaculate.
01:53:47 PCP is immaculate.
01:53:48 Yeah.
01:53:48 In weird brackets.
01:53:49 All right.
01:53:50 So here we go.
01:53:51 Begin fucking now.
01:53:57 No matches.
01:53:58 Okay.
01:53:58 Sorry.
01:53:58 Hang on.
01:53:59 Wait, I can see you.
01:54:00 Wait, are you, are you playing this?
01:54:02 Will I be able to hear this?
01:54:03 It's going to be pushed through the thing.
01:54:04 Don't worry.
01:54:05 Don't worry.
01:54:05 Okay.
01:54:05 Okay.
01:54:06 That's why I'm a robot.
01:54:07 I don't know why that didn't work.
01:54:08 Hang on.
01:54:08 Hang on.
01:54:10 Fucking is this right?
01:54:11 Okay.
01:54:11 Here we go.
01:54:12 Okay.
01:54:15 Okay.
01:54:15 Play now.
01:54:24 Is it, is it posh?
01:54:25 Yeah.
01:54:25 It's going.
01:54:25 It's starting.
01:54:28 Oh, slow and sharp.
01:54:29 Here it is.
01:54:30 I can't hear.
01:54:31 Turn up the volume on the button.
01:54:31 It's playing too much.
01:54:36 On the bot?
01:54:37 The rhythm bot.
01:54:39 Oh.
01:54:41 That's a little better.
01:54:42 Oh, that's ASMR.
01:54:43 I hate it.
01:54:51 He's just what he's wishing for.
01:54:52 Shut up.
01:54:54 Sorry.
01:54:55 When's the drop?
01:55:01 I feel like one's coming.
01:55:06 I like how sinister it sounds.
01:55:09 Yeah.
01:55:13 Oh.
01:55:15 Oh.
01:55:15 Okay.
01:55:16 Well, there you go.
01:55:19 ASMR opening.
01:55:20 I mean, I'm just surprised after all our talk of like trying to set a hype mood for the podcast.
01:55:28 This was the approach you chose to go with.
01:55:29 I mean, don't get me wrong.
01:55:30 I couldn't hear like any of the words.
01:55:32 I'm sorry to say.
01:55:33 Hopefully.
01:55:34 I couldn't.
01:55:34 Yeah.
01:55:35 Hopefully our viewers.
01:55:36 He said he was whispering the PCP.
01:55:38 Oh, it's immaculate or something.
01:55:40 Yeah.
01:55:40 I heard that.
01:55:41 I heard that much.
01:55:42 It's kind of funny.
01:55:42 I love the music.
01:55:43 I really don't like ASMR.
01:55:46 I'm sorry.
01:55:47 I don't.
01:55:47 I don't.
01:55:48 I just.
01:55:49 There you go.
01:55:50 It's got the main veto.
01:55:52 Well, here's an idea.
01:55:54 Maybe this, maybe we don't use this as the theme song,
01:55:57 but maybe we just play this subtly in the background of every episode all the time
01:56:02 to subliminally influence the audience.
01:56:05 They are signing all rights to the usage of this song forever by submitting it to this contest,
01:56:10 as agreed previously at some point.
01:56:13 So, yeah, I mean, this is all ours for the taking.
01:56:16 Thank you very much for giving it to us.
01:56:18 Remember the ASMR bonus episode?
01:56:20 Oh, I sure do.
01:56:22 Who could forget our best episode ever?
01:56:25 Um, fantastic.
01:56:26 Fantastic.
01:56:27 Okay.
01:56:27 Here we go.
01:56:28 Next one.
01:56:28 Next one.
01:56:29 This is from at Slam Rarn.
01:56:31 And here it is.
01:56:33 What's it say?
01:56:33 Oh, Sixten.
01:56:34 Hope Jess is okay with me reworking his melody.
01:56:37 You can credit me as Sixten Machado,
01:56:39 since Slam Rarn is unpronounceable.
01:56:43 Well, I mean, he's not wrong.
01:56:43 That's not that unpronounceable.
01:56:45 Yeah.
01:56:45 I figured it out.
01:56:46 But here we go.
01:56:47 Oh, and it's called, apparently, it's called Four Exposure Crastinator,
01:56:52 as opposed to Procrastinator.
01:56:54 Oh, I like that.
01:56:55 Oh, I don't.
01:56:56 Okay.
01:56:56 Here we go.
01:56:58 Impress me.
01:57:21 I mean, well, that was pretty juicy.
01:57:28 That was very juicy.
01:57:29 But was that Jesse's melody?
01:57:31 I couldn't even detect it.
01:57:32 He probably like took the main melody and like,
01:57:36 I don't know, did something with it.
01:57:37 I mean, it didn't sound like it.
01:57:39 I think you changed it to a point where you can't recognize it, which is-
01:57:43 So I'm sure Jesse will not mind, as a matter of fact.
01:57:47 Yeah, that was juicy as well.
01:57:48 I mean, that was really good.
01:57:49 That was really good.
01:57:51 I liked a lot of that.
01:57:53 It's pretty sick.
01:57:53 I don't know.
01:57:54 But it didn't have any-
01:57:55 It didn't have any fucking jokes in it, though.
01:57:57 Yeah, I mean, you're not wrong.
01:57:59 I'm not laughing.
01:58:00 Yeah.
01:58:01 The only joke was your submission of that song.
01:58:05 Got him.
01:58:08 Yeah, I know.
01:58:09 That's why I said it.
01:58:11 Sixten?
01:58:11 Oh, that was Sixten.
01:58:13 Well, I mean, thanks for the submission.
01:58:15 I don't know.
01:58:15 I'm going to add that to my ones in my brain of ones to review
01:58:19 as we get closer to the finale here.
01:58:21 I will put that on the serious consideration list.
01:58:24 Yeah.
01:58:25 Yeah.
01:58:25 Man, I don't even have a list for that.
01:58:27 It hits the-
01:58:27 I'm going to make it later.
01:58:29 I don't have a physical list.
01:58:30 I mean, it hits the tone.
01:58:31 The tone is exactly right.
01:58:32 Yeah, the tone is really good.
01:58:33 The tone is really good.
01:58:33 The tone is exactly right.
01:58:34 Like, if there had been a voice over it singing about like,
01:58:38 memes, memes, memes,
01:58:40 hand voice, memes, memes, you know?
01:58:42 Cut that clip of that audience.
01:58:46 Just remix that on top.
01:58:48 Remix that on top.
01:58:51 Just have Nate saying memes.
01:58:52 PCP.
01:58:53 Memes.
01:58:53 Memes.
01:58:54 PCP.
01:58:54 And just shift it.
01:58:56 Yeah, there's some more for you.
01:58:58 I don't even-
01:58:58 Yeah.
01:58:59 Yeah, okay.
01:58:59 That'll work.
01:59:00 Some combination of that.
01:59:01 All right.
01:59:01 Well, let's move on to the next one.
01:59:02 Okay, here we go.
01:59:03 This is at Alex with lots of A's and S's.
01:59:08 Just listened to the recent episode,
01:59:09 so here's a cover of Jesse's song.
01:59:11 But with Eurobeat Sense and some PCP fan art
01:59:14 for our boy, the PCP guy,
01:59:16 having a good drift.
01:59:17 Okay, so make sure this fan art's on screen
01:59:20 because it's actually fucking dope.
01:59:22 Do you guys see this?
01:59:23 Can you-
01:59:23 Yeah.
01:59:23 Are you seeing this in the-
01:59:24 Oh.
01:59:24 In the PCB Themes channel?
01:59:26 Oh, I'm seeing it.
01:59:26 Oh, I'm seeing it.
01:59:27 He's drifting like a motherfucker.
01:59:28 He's Tokyo drifting everywhere.
01:59:31 That looks fucking incredible.
01:59:33 It looks fucking incredible.
01:59:34 Max revived the PCP guy right now.
01:59:39 All right, but let's play this.
01:59:40 Here we go.
01:59:41 I want to hear this tasty jam.
01:59:42 Okay, here we go.
01:59:43 Oh, I gotta do this weird thing
01:59:43 where I have to like paste the thing into-
01:59:46 Oh, it's on YouTube.
01:59:47 Okay, hang on.
01:59:49 And here I go.
01:59:51 Play now.
01:59:57 Oh, okay.
02:00:04 Yeah.
02:00:18 Oh, I like those sinks.
02:00:33 Yeah, that's nice.
02:00:33 It's nice.
02:00:34 Yeah, yeah.
02:00:49 I mean, can we use that?
02:00:53 Well, the very end of that is like really good.
02:00:55 Yeah, I really like the end.
02:00:56 Can we use that for our episode on the 80s?
02:01:00 Can we do that?
02:01:01 I mean, all right, I guess the 90s, all right.
02:01:03 I don't know.
02:01:04 Anyway, that was really good.
02:01:06 That was pretty tasty.
02:01:07 Yeah.
02:01:08 I really like the synth.
02:01:09 It was pretty tasty.
02:01:10 I mean, I like a lot of that.
02:01:11 I really like, as soon as the synths kicked in.
02:01:13 Is it cheap to use one that's just basically
02:01:18 a synth remix of the old one?
02:01:20 Not if it's good.
02:01:22 Is that an anticlimactic conclusion?
02:01:26 I would say that, okay, for me, it is.
02:01:28 For me, it would be anticlimactic,
02:01:30 which is why this would probably not be my choice.
02:01:33 I would rather get something new.
02:01:36 I have to admit it.
02:01:37 Yeah.
02:01:37 I have to admit it.
02:01:38 Also, that was a little bit like more downbeat.
02:01:41 You know, if that's the right word, you know, what I'm thinking of?
02:01:45 Yeah, yeah, it was kind of chill.
02:01:47 You know, these are all, these are my thoughts.
02:01:51 Maybe not worth of a theme, but generally, I really like the sound of it.
02:01:56 Yeah, I mean, I really liked it.
02:01:59 I loved it so much.
02:02:02 I wasn't much into the vocals, but I like the synths when they kicked in.
02:02:06 Like the very end, when I did the,
02:02:10 but in the synth.
02:02:11 Yeah, that sounds great.
02:02:11 But it was fading out.
02:02:12 If you could like send me like a version that is just that without the fading out bit.
02:02:18 Yeah, do it, Doug.
02:02:20 So I can, so I can max gain it and put it on loop.
02:02:23 By the way, you did some good work, person.
02:02:25 Click on the main chat and look at like the way that the thing looks.
02:02:28 Like this is like the image that went with it.
02:02:31 It looks fucking sick.
02:02:33 I've got a solution.
02:02:35 I've got a solution to this whole quagmire.
02:02:37 What if, okay, like we end, we end the contest, you know,
02:02:42 we pick a winner and all that, what if, what if we, you know, aside from naming a winner,
02:02:49 we, uh, we just take all like our favorites and just have them be outros like whenever we want
02:02:57 this, or at least once, just do them in sequence.
02:03:00 And then like, what if just like forever after, like anyone that wants to submit like a song,
02:03:06 like if we listen to it and we like it, we can put it in the rotation and we can just,
02:03:10 we can just close out episodes with like different people's songs all the time.
02:03:13 I gotta tell you, I sure don't hate that idea.
02:03:17 Say it, say it, fam.
02:03:18 I'm interested in hearing what the fans think about that idea.
02:03:21 Like, like, yeah, like what if it was just a continuous thing?
02:03:24 Like, you know, you make a PCP fan song, we fucking play it as the outro to the episode.
02:03:28 That sounds like a pretty good idea.
02:03:30 Sounds like a pretty, I know.
02:03:31 I personally, I mean, as is the purpose for this entire contest, I'm way into the idea of
02:03:37 having a theme song that is the theme song.
02:03:40 But for the outros, I'm way into that.
02:03:42 I'm way into that.
02:03:43 Yeah.
02:03:44 All right, well, you know, keep talking about it.
02:03:47 Let's, let's get to the next one here.
02:03:48 This is from at Eric Seabase.
02:03:50 This is his second submission and it's called, I believe it's called crazy.o or crazy.zero,
02:03:56 one of the two.
02:03:58 And it goes a little something like this.
02:04:07 Oh, that bass.
02:04:08 I can't say no to the beat.
02:04:10 I can't say no to the beat.
02:04:20 Yeah.
02:04:20 Yeah.
02:04:26 Oh, well, that is so good.
02:04:29 That was just, that was just irresistible.
02:04:31 Yeah, I love it.
02:04:32 I love it so much.
02:04:33 Oh my god.
02:04:33 Yeah.
02:04:34 Oh, it's like vaguely reminiscent.
02:04:36 I'm not saying it's copying, but vaguely reminiscent of that style of like,
02:04:40 you guys know the song?
02:04:42 Oh, now I forgot it.
02:04:43 I just knew it.
02:04:44 I'm so excited.
02:04:45 I forgot everything.
02:04:46 Darude sandstorm.
02:04:49 It's a little long.
02:04:50 It's a little longer than I would prefer.
02:04:52 You were made for loving me.
02:04:53 Yeah, that song.
02:04:54 I don't know that one.
02:04:54 Sort of like the beginning.
02:04:55 I know that one.
02:04:56 Yeah.
02:04:56 It's a very old song.
02:04:57 The beginning.
02:04:58 Well, you know, man, I mean, if it's too long is the problem.
02:05:01 We can't always like fade it out sooner.
02:05:02 You know, I, that's not major.
02:05:05 That's true.
02:05:06 That's true.
02:05:07 I mean, yeah, again, that's another one that hits the tone.
02:05:11 Yeah, it really does.
02:05:12 Right on, right, right where I'm looking, right where I'm looking at, Boyo.
02:05:17 That's a good one.
02:05:19 So good.
02:05:20 Next song.
02:05:21 What do you think, Gib?
02:05:21 What do you think?
02:05:24 Oh, yeah, I liked it.
02:05:25 It was very well produced.
02:05:26 Yeah.
02:05:27 I think it was this like a better version of the one he already made.
02:05:31 It might have been.
02:05:32 It sounded familiar.
02:05:32 It might have been.
02:05:33 This is a second submission.
02:05:34 Yeah, I was going to say.
02:05:35 You know what?
02:05:36 Let me check his SoundCloud real quick.
02:05:38 Oh, well, if it's a remake, then I take back everything.
02:05:41 Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
02:05:42 He, you know what?
02:05:43 He made one called Crazy.
02:05:46 Oh, that is very similar, but not exactly the same.
02:05:48 Yep.
02:05:49 Yep, yep, yep.
02:05:50 Throw him in the garbage.
02:05:51 No, wait, no, this is another level.
02:05:52 He's improving on his work.
02:05:52 Destroy him.
02:05:54 Ben.
02:05:56 Mining his old work for new content.
02:05:59 Kill him.
02:06:01 Oh, he's improving on his work.
02:06:02 Second drafts for checkers.
02:06:05 You want to listen to his previous one just for comparison sake?
02:06:07 Improving on his work.
02:06:08 Yes, I do.
02:06:08 You mean he wasn't as good as, you mean that he didn't have 10,
02:06:11 he wasn't born with it?
02:06:12 I know, that's offensive.
02:06:13 Fuck.
02:06:13 Yo, let's listen to his old one just for comparison sake,
02:06:16 just for fun.
02:06:17 Okay, here, here.
02:06:19 Go.
02:06:23 Yeah, I remember this one.
02:06:33 Okay, there was voices in it.
02:06:37 I kind of like this part of it.
02:06:38 Yeah, I miss this part of the other one.
02:06:40 The other one doesn't have.
02:06:47 And I like that one too.
02:06:49 I kind of like that one.
02:06:51 There's things I like about both of them, I guess.
02:06:54 This guy, this dude, I like his style.
02:06:57 This was the one, this, it was the super basic,
02:06:59 was the newest first guy, the super basic.
02:07:02 I mean, I really like, I really like the vocals and the haas.
02:07:05 Yeah, I see.
02:07:05 But I also, but I also really like the super basic.
02:07:07 I mean, his name is Eric C. Bass.
02:07:08 So of course, his bass is true, must be true.
02:07:11 Oh, no.
02:07:11 Hey, you know what I'll say, Eric?
02:07:12 He's C. Bass, he plays.
02:07:13 I think you have a winner here.
02:07:15 If you make two changes, one, in some way add back those ooze
02:07:18 and aahs because they're cool.
02:07:20 And in two, put some sort of spoken word intro
02:07:23 that is good in some way at like during the bass or something.
02:07:27 You know, here's my thought about words.
02:07:30 Yeah.
02:07:31 Is that most people don't have like a good singing or like voice.
02:07:37 And not to be mean or like,
02:07:41 like, like if we have like words baked,
02:07:43 I would just pay us to sing.
02:07:44 Yeah, yeah.
02:07:45 We're immaculate.
02:07:46 It's, it's, it's not that we're better, but like, I don't know.
02:07:51 The music is always like great.
02:07:53 People are good at making the music,
02:07:54 but not necessarily the singing.
02:07:56 Yeah, I prefer the ones that don't have the things,
02:07:59 unless it's like very funny.
02:08:02 To me, making a music track like one of these is like
02:08:06 very far beyond what I would know how to do.
02:08:10 Yes.
02:08:10 I'm very, I'm very impressed and a little confused by all of these.
02:08:15 That's how I always feel.
02:08:17 Yep.
02:08:17 You know, this is not my, this is not my wheelhouse.
02:08:21 Well, all right.
02:08:22 I mean, I don't know.
02:08:23 Take that advice, do what the fuck you want with it.
02:08:25 In the meantime.
02:08:26 There's one more.
02:08:27 Let's go to the next one.
02:08:28 There's one more.
02:08:29 There's one more.
02:08:29 Yeah.
02:08:29 Uh, let me see.
02:08:30 This is from, uh, Doss Biggles at Doss Biggles.
02:08:34 Oh, Doss Biggles.
02:08:35 Yeah.
02:08:35 A barrel roll violet intro cut.
02:08:38 All right.
02:08:38 Here we go.
02:08:40 And a one and a two and a.
02:08:44 Whoa.
02:08:45 Oh, we're in the future.
02:08:49 This is, this is like a glitchy Steven universe.
02:08:52 He is.
02:08:54 Whoa.
02:08:58 Okay, it's fading out.
02:09:04 That was neat.
02:09:05 That was, that was.
02:09:06 Wow.
02:09:06 That was cool.
02:09:07 Like today, today's submissions are just like killing it.
02:09:10 I liked it and not necessarily maybe for the theme,
02:09:12 but just overall that's like, that was amazing.
02:09:14 Yeah.
02:09:15 I was way into that too.
02:09:16 That was really interesting.
02:09:18 I was thinking, I've been playing some nuclear throne
02:09:21 and that, that one brought me right to the crystal cave.
02:09:24 Okay.
02:09:25 I have, I have a small tiny question.
02:09:29 If let's say I decide to do something for it,
02:09:31 for my channel, would that be okay?
02:09:33 I guess you'd have to take it up.
02:09:34 You'd have to ask, you know.
02:09:35 Yeah.
02:09:35 You know that.
02:09:36 So ask him this guy.
02:09:38 This is no guarantee.
02:09:39 But I feel like you're your odds are good mage
02:09:42 because in the description of the tweet,
02:09:44 it says violets for life.
02:09:45 I'm assuming that's a good sign.
02:09:48 That's a good sign.
02:09:49 I don't know.
02:09:50 I don't want to make it.
02:09:53 I wouldn't assume, but I'm saying
02:09:54 the odds are good.
02:09:55 We got his Twitter.
02:09:56 You know, you can tweet at him, whatever.
02:09:58 All right.
02:09:58 Well, that's it.
02:09:59 That's all the...
02:09:59 Tweeting your strangers.
02:10:01 That's all.
02:10:02 He's not a stranger.
02:10:02 He's a violet for life.
02:10:03 He's a violin violet for life.
02:10:06 Oh, also he says PS Play God Hand
02:10:09 is his other note about the submission.
02:10:11 So...
02:10:12 No, I hate video games.
02:10:14 Oh, no.
02:10:15 Fair.
02:10:16 All right.
02:10:17 Well, that's done.
02:10:17 That's done.
02:10:18 All right.
02:10:18 Let's go to the questions guys.
02:10:20 We're all done with this shit.
02:10:21 You got like three more weeks
02:10:22 to get those, those themes in everybody.
02:10:24 So, you know, get to it.
02:10:26 I have a question.
02:10:27 Oh, you do?
02:10:28 Oh, that's good.
02:10:29 What do you got?
02:10:29 What do you got?
02:10:30 It's by Chip Weisman.
02:10:32 If you were all Sailor Scouts, like Sailor Moon,
02:10:34 what celestial bodies would you represent?
02:10:37 And why?
02:10:39 That's great.
02:10:39 Also note, not limited to moons slash planets.
02:10:42 So...
02:10:43 Okay, okay.
02:10:46 Hold on, hold on.
02:10:48 I'm trying to think of one that's good.
02:10:50 I know exactly the one.
02:10:53 Wait, what was the question?
02:10:54 If you were a Sailor Scout, what sort of celestial body
02:10:57 would you represent?
02:10:58 I would represent the Pillars of Creation,
02:11:00 which is a nebula.
02:11:01 All right.
02:11:02 All right.
02:11:03 All right.
02:11:03 Settle it down, Ben.
02:11:04 Settle it down over here.
02:11:05 It's a fucking cool nebula.
02:11:07 I want to be a cool nebula boy.
02:11:08 Yeah, all right.
02:11:09 All right.
02:11:09 What is a nebula anyway?
02:11:10 I'd be...
02:11:11 No one knows.
02:11:12 It's a cloud of fucking space gas.
02:11:14 That's pretty gay.
02:11:15 I was going to describe it as space gas.
02:11:18 And I am actually right.
02:11:19 That's what it is.
02:11:20 Well, it does.
02:11:21 Don't...
02:11:22 Gas gas gas.
02:11:23 Yeah.
02:11:23 Sometimes they congeal into suns.
02:11:26 Gibba's saying something, right?
02:11:27 What do you got?
02:11:30 I don't know.
02:11:30 What do I...
02:11:31 What do you think I am?
02:11:32 Planet World.
02:11:33 You be a Sailor Moon.
02:11:36 I don't think that one's taken yet.
02:11:37 That's open for business.
02:11:41 I have a...
02:11:42 I'd be a Sailor...
02:11:43 I'd be a pirate Moon.
02:11:44 Look, you're a Sailor.
02:11:45 Like, you just have the hat, you know, on a boat.
02:11:48 Oh, yeah.
02:11:48 You know, Sailor...
02:11:50 I'm a pirate.
02:11:51 I got...
02:11:51 I got a space submarine.
02:11:54 I'm just going to Google cool ass celestial body.
02:12:00 While you're googling, I would be Sailor Meteor
02:12:02 because I want to destroy the planet.
02:12:04 Whoa!
02:12:06 Oh, there she goes.
02:12:07 There she goes.
02:12:08 On the other end of the spectrum, I would be Sailor Phobos,
02:12:11 which is Mars Moon,
02:12:12 because that's like on a trajectory
02:12:13 to crash into something and destroy itself.
02:12:15 And that's the...
02:12:16 That's mine.
02:12:17 Oh, damn.
02:12:18 That's a good one.
02:12:19 It is good, though.
02:12:21 You know, I'll just go with Sailor Europa
02:12:23 because it's the Moon where there might be life possibly
02:12:26 orbiting around Jupiter,
02:12:27 and that's pretty cool.
02:12:28 I like that.
02:12:28 I like Sun Europa.
02:12:29 Sun...
02:12:30 ...Homely.
02:12:31 European.
02:12:34 Yeah?
02:12:35 That was a joke.
02:12:37 Fair enough.
02:12:38 Fair enough.
02:12:39 One other question.
02:12:41 I found it funny.
02:12:42 Oh, Sailor Black Hole.
02:12:44 Oh, that's a good one.
02:12:45 Though super edgy.
02:12:46 That's like if Shadow the Hedgehog were a Sailor Scout,
02:12:49 he would definitely be Sailor White.
02:12:51 No doubt.
02:12:52 Also known as Ryuko Matori.
02:12:54 Yeah, pretty much.
02:12:55 Oh my god, you're absolutely right.
02:12:56 She is Sailor Black Hole.
02:12:58 Making Satsuki Sailor Sun?
02:13:01 I guess.
02:13:02 White Hole.
02:13:02 Ooh.
02:13:03 She's got a nice white hole,
02:13:05 if you know what I'm talking about.
02:13:07 What does that even mean?
02:13:08 I don't know.
02:13:11 All right, moving on.
02:13:11 I guess I don't know what you mean.
02:13:13 I don't know either.
02:13:16 There's another thing.
02:13:17 It just means it's well-lived, that's all.
02:13:19 Yeah, okay.
02:13:21 I'm just going to put out there.
02:13:22 I'm talking bleached asshole.
02:13:23 That's what I'm thinking is what, you know,
02:13:25 just bringing it home.
02:13:26 All right.
02:13:27 Anyway, there you go.
02:13:29 A quick question is like Batsling asks,
02:13:32 how many mages does it take to screw in a lightbulb
02:13:35 and has like four people with the emoji of shit?
02:13:38 And I just thought it.
02:13:41 Oh, no, mage.
02:13:42 No, bad questions are banned.
02:13:43 We're trying to elicit good questions.
02:13:47 I see a pretty good question here on the Twitter,
02:13:50 so this is going to be our pity question.
02:13:51 By the way, Bats is one.
02:13:52 One.
02:13:52 There you go.
02:13:54 By two Fry Mcguy, hashtag askpcp,
02:13:58 have you guys ever been caught up in a fad or trend
02:14:01 that you regret or are embarrassed about?
02:14:03 Besides MLP, of course.
02:14:06 That's funny.
02:14:07 Well, I'm not embarrassed about that.
02:14:08 That was very funny.
02:14:09 Yeah, yeah, I feel the same way.
02:14:12 I mean, I would never be embarrassed
02:14:14 with that sweet T-Bap Patreon money
02:14:16 rolling in week after week to this day.
02:14:19 Proud ex-Brownie.
02:14:22 Wait, no, no, never.
02:14:23 I'm not ashamed or regretful.
02:14:24 I never called myself a Brownie.
02:14:26 I'm just glad to put it behind me, I guess.
02:14:30 Okay, well, aside from that.
02:14:31 I mean, I was really into this movement
02:14:32 called homosexuality for a while,
02:14:34 but looking back on it may have been a poor choice.
02:14:37 I was really big into Gamergate,
02:14:39 and I think they made some good points in hindsight.
02:14:42 That's a joke, by the way.
02:14:43 It was not actually a Gamergate.
02:14:44 Well, there you go.
02:14:45 But I was into the Nazi party.
02:14:48 It'd been World War II, we might have heard of it.
02:14:51 Indeed.
02:14:52 No.
02:14:54 Anime.
02:14:55 That was an embarrassing, terrible phase of my life.
02:14:58 I liked anime.
02:14:59 Liked video games for a little while,
02:15:01 but that was a mistake.
02:15:02 I guess I was...
02:15:04 I don't know.
02:15:05 I can't really think of anything.
02:15:07 I mean, okay, I was just...
02:15:09 Oh, sorry, sorry.
02:15:09 No, here, go ahead.
02:15:11 I'm stuck hanging.
02:15:11 I was tweeting pictures.
02:15:13 I was at our parents' house,
02:15:15 helping them get my shit out of there
02:15:17 because they're moving.
02:15:18 I tweeted some pictures of some of my old junk.
02:15:21 I'm not really that...
02:15:22 It probably should be embarrassed about it.
02:15:24 Okay, some of it I don't think is that embarrassing,
02:15:26 like my marble collection.
02:15:28 Those are nice.
02:15:29 Sure.
02:15:29 But then some other stuff...
02:15:32 Some of those are pretty cool, by the way.
02:15:34 Got some lutses?
02:15:35 Hell yeah.
02:15:37 Hell yeah.
02:15:39 Hell yeah.
02:15:40 But then there's some other stuff
02:15:42 that probably should be embarrassed about,
02:15:44 like my collection of fucking goth jewelry from...
02:15:47 Yeah, now we're talking.
02:15:48 Now we're talking.
02:15:49 Yeah, I got my sword with a dragon on it.
02:15:51 Like, forget about it.
02:15:54 And then Celtic Cross, fuck yeah.
02:15:57 And the...
02:15:57 Oh, and the big pile of fucking brightly colored,
02:16:01 like many of them have like Japanese symbols on them,
02:16:04 like nylon, Hawaiian...
02:16:05 Oversized nylon, Hawaiian shirt.
02:16:07 I had a bunch of those too, dude.
02:16:10 Middles in high school.
02:16:11 Yeah.
02:16:11 Well, mostly Middles.
02:16:12 That was my life in high school.
02:16:13 I wore my shirt in high school as well.
02:16:14 Yeah, yeah.
02:16:15 Yep, yep.
02:16:16 I was sad.
02:16:17 I was sad to let them go,
02:16:18 but I was like, I need...
02:16:19 This needs to be in the past and stay there.
02:16:22 Should have busted them out, dude.
02:16:23 One more round.
02:16:25 I had a...
02:16:25 I almost wanted to.
02:16:28 I had a phase myself.
02:16:31 It was around the time where,
02:16:32 like all these labels, like,
02:16:33 oh, it's the golf prep,
02:16:35 prep, emo, jock, yadda yadda,
02:16:37 we're like hitting Lithuania.
02:16:39 At least it was new to me,
02:16:41 and my circle of friends, and whatnot.
02:16:43 And, like, all the magazines that my friends bought,
02:16:46 and I was too poor to buy,
02:16:47 like, oh, they were talking about all these,
02:16:49 you know, fashion, whatever.
02:16:51 And, like, I sort of...
02:16:53 For a short while,
02:16:54 I considered myself golf,
02:16:56 because I dressed in black.
02:16:57 But, like...
02:16:58 Yeah!
02:16:59 I wasn't...
02:17:00 Like, it was, like, the fashion.
02:17:02 After a while, I actually learned
02:17:03 what a goth is,
02:17:04 other than, like, you know,
02:17:05 it's not just dressing black.
02:17:07 You know, there's a certain style
02:17:08 of fashion and stuff like that.
02:17:10 And after I learned it, it was like, oh,
02:17:13 that's kind of silly.
02:17:14 You know, I'm gonna be, like, a punk goth.
02:17:17 Like, because, like, in those magazines and whatnot,
02:17:20 it said, like, you know, like,
02:17:21 a female goth had, like,
02:17:22 all dresses or skirts, long skirts,
02:17:24 and, you know, lots of makeup and whatnot.
02:17:26 I was not about that.
02:17:27 I liked dressing in black,
02:17:28 and I was more, like,
02:17:31 baggy trousers with, like,
02:17:33 lots of pockets in them,
02:17:34 and, like, a black shirt
02:17:36 with an edgy-ass dragon on it.
02:17:38 And, like, I dyed the tips of my hair red.
02:17:41 I wanted a full black, but my mom didn't let me.
02:17:43 Ooh, where do you go?
02:17:45 I settled for the tips being red.
02:17:47 This is after your feral period, right?
02:17:50 Yeah.
02:17:50 Yeah.
02:17:52 I was in my teens.
02:17:53 Like, I was a teen, a young teen,
02:17:55 I think, 13 or so.
02:17:56 And I also collected skulls.
02:17:58 Well, rather, like, skull-related accessories.
02:18:02 Oh, okay.
02:18:03 I thought, like, like, literal things.
02:18:04 I would go, I would punch through their eye-sock.
02:18:07 So I'd see skulls out of their head.
02:18:08 That I'd find in the streets.
02:18:09 Yeah.
02:18:10 That was the violent-violence finishing move.
02:18:13 Yeah, exactly.
02:18:14 At least I come back weeks later
02:18:16 after some of my victims,
02:18:17 after they've had time for the skin-to-blood off.
02:18:19 Well, isn't it a Mortal Kombat finisher
02:18:20 where you rip the skull out of somebody's head?
02:18:22 I think somebody has that.
02:18:24 If Majors in Mortal Kombat,
02:18:25 that would be her finishing move, for sure.
02:18:27 Somebody mod Mortal Kombat 9
02:18:29 or whatever, get Majin there.
02:18:31 Yeah, yeah, that'd be good.
02:18:32 Take that, you know, there's that girl
02:18:34 who already wears purple
02:18:35 with the big, scary mouth, you know?
02:18:37 Wouldn't be too hard, wouldn't be too hard.
02:18:40 I was a, I was a goth.
02:18:42 I was a big goth.
02:18:43 Yeah.
02:18:44 I had, I had all the things.
02:18:46 The, the hair.
02:18:49 The, the eyes, the things.
02:18:52 Man, I was surely a goth back in the day.
02:18:58 I wasn't a goth.
02:18:59 I was boring.
02:19:00 But I want people to draw me as a goth
02:19:02 because it's really funny.
02:19:03 That is really funny.
02:19:05 Draw us all as goths, everybody.
02:19:07 The most embarrassing, the,
02:19:09 the most embarrassing thing about me
02:19:12 is that I wasn't part of a stupid embarrassing thing
02:19:15 and I don't have any funny stories.
02:19:17 Oh, I know.
02:19:17 I was just like kind, I've kind of shy and timid
02:19:21 and I did as I was told and then school was over
02:19:25 and I was like, oh.
02:19:26 That's what I was like.
02:19:27 I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't have
02:19:29 any funny silly things that I could look back on
02:19:33 and be like, oh no cringe.
02:19:35 Like I was just, I had brown hair and I didn't do anything.
02:19:39 When I think about like my, what made me cringe as a youth,
02:19:42 it was, it was like my attitude more than anything.
02:19:45 Cause like, you know, like I liked like transformers
02:19:49 and like, you know, like when I was like,
02:19:51 when I was like eight or nine or something,
02:19:53 I was really into like Power Rangers.
02:19:54 I don't see anything to be embarrassed
02:19:56 about being like a kindergartner
02:19:57 who's into like Power Rangers or anything.
02:20:00 And like I liked anime ever since I was like 10.
02:20:03 I still do.
02:20:04 So, you know, I mean, you know,
02:20:06 you can be a mid-level ashamed about that just in general,
02:20:09 but unironically, I'm just, I'm just not.
02:20:12 So I'm totally over that.
02:20:15 So I don't really know.
02:20:15 That sort of reminded me.
02:20:17 I was a thing, I'm like, I'm not necessarily ashamed of now,
02:20:20 but I used to be at that point.
02:20:21 Like I was like, I know I was over eight years old
02:20:25 and remember I was a tall boy.
02:20:28 I used to really like coloring books
02:20:30 and I was really embarrassed about buying coloring books
02:20:32 at that age because I felt like I was too old
02:20:36 or at least looked too old to buy coloring books for myself.
02:20:39 So I was, I love it.
02:20:40 That is so adorable.
02:20:41 It's like, go to the store to buy coloring books
02:20:43 for yourself to color in.
02:20:45 I would never, it's never crossed my mind
02:20:48 that one would do such a thing,
02:20:49 but that's super adorable.
02:20:51 I love that.
02:20:52 I mean, they have like legit coloring books that are like,
02:20:55 you know.
02:20:56 A type of coloring books I really liked.
02:20:57 There are adult coloring books, aren't they?
02:20:59 Isn't that like a thing?
02:21:00 Oh, but they're stupid.
02:21:01 Yeah.
02:21:01 Are they?
02:21:02 Okay.
02:21:02 All right.
02:21:03 They're just like a bunch of shapes.
02:21:04 Mage, did you color them all in purple?
02:21:07 I was gonna say, like you would go from like the crayon box
02:21:10 to the coloring pencil box to the markers
02:21:12 and every purple color would be gone.
02:21:14 You would get a whole thing of like 20 different colors,
02:21:17 but you would throw them all away and keep the purple ones.
02:21:19 My purple face started in my teen hood.
02:21:22 No, like what I would buy,
02:21:23 I did the favorite type of coloring books I used to like.
02:21:26 Oh, they were like paper dolls and you could like put like,
02:21:29 you cut them out like, and then there's clothes.
02:21:33 You can cut them out and put them on them like for paper dolls,
02:21:35 but you color them in yourself.
02:21:37 And like, I was really into making paper dolls at that time.
02:21:41 And like, I even made like Dragon Ball Z dolls.
02:21:43 I remember I made one of the cheetahs.
02:21:46 A who?
02:21:46 A Vegeta.
02:21:47 Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z.
02:21:48 Oh, Vegeta.
02:21:49 Dude, that's sick.
02:21:50 Yeah.
02:21:51 Like, uh, like me and my friends were like all about that
02:21:53 making paper doll craze and we would make our own clothes
02:21:56 and color them in and stuff like that.
02:21:58 And those paper dolls were like more official looking,
02:22:00 of course, because, you know, we couldn't draw for shit.
02:22:03 But it was real.
02:22:04 It was real great.
02:22:05 I was a big fan and it was embarrassing.
02:22:09 Anybody else want to chime in on this?
02:22:11 Or I got another question.
02:22:14 I've got another question.
02:22:15 Okay, yeah, go ahead.
02:22:17 This is by Rugae in the progressionators lounge.
02:22:21 He says, let's say you want to have a specific character trait,
02:22:25 traits.
02:22:26 How do you do that?
02:22:27 Do you force certain behavior in your everyday life or what?
02:22:33 I thought this was really interesting because, like,
02:22:35 I have had similar thoughts.
02:22:37 He's asking, like, if you want to be a certain way to have, like,
02:22:41 to be a certain way in, like, normal life without trying,
02:22:46 do you have to force it all the time and until it sticks?
02:22:50 Yes.
02:22:51 Because I've never managed to really do that.
02:22:53 Yes, same.
02:22:54 I think everything that is, like, accidental.
02:22:57 The only time in my life I succeeded in this kind of a quest of
02:23:01 consciously trying to change myself was with my, like,
02:23:05 forcing myself to go out and, like, talk to girls in college.
02:23:08 And I didn't even succeed anywhere near, like, the, like,
02:23:13 the stuff I was, like, reading at the time about, like,
02:23:15 how to be more, you know, social and stuff was, like, telling me to.
02:23:18 But, like, it long-term manifested in a much larger degree of,
02:23:23 like, willingness to, like, talk to people and, like,
02:23:26 do things and, like, kind of take initiative in life.
02:23:29 So even at the time, it wasn't, like, a huge change right then and there.
02:23:33 But I did actively have to force myself to do things differently.
02:23:37 And I do believe I changed majorly long-term as a result of taking those actions.
02:23:43 I mean, I think if you force yourself, if you force yourself to
02:23:47 regularly engage in a behavior that you were not, it, it, it will definitely have an effect.
02:23:53 Okay, okay. Guys, I do agree with you, but I think it still takes a certain type of
02:23:59 person to do that because for me personally, I had some personal experience with it.
02:24:03 I tried forcing something and it's just, like, at some point I came to the conclusion,
02:24:08 like, I was failing despite constantly trying, but at a certain point I came to the conclusion,
02:24:12 like, like, I am trying this and I'm forcing myself to do this, but at what point am I living
02:24:19 a lie because it was stressing me out and I know I'll never be this person that I'm trying to be
02:24:24 despite all this attempts and, like, even if I was successful, then I'll have to go on being
02:24:29 this person and I don't feel comfortable being this despite wanting to be this. So I stop.
02:24:35 One is reminded of the adage of the oak tree that, that groweth tall and true.
02:24:44 And as it grows, you can shape it and kind of guide it along a certain path, but once it's
02:24:49 grown too far, if you try to bend it in a certain way, as opposed to how it's already started to
02:24:55 grow, then it can bend to a degree, but eventually it will snap, or it could just not, you know,
02:25:00 it just might not go that way. I think, like, certain things can be changed, for instance,
02:25:06 like wanting to be able to speak more or speak up more or speak faster, something like those things.
02:25:12 You can't definitely push yourself. Well, major, you're making this point about people or about
02:25:15 yourself. And I know people. I mean, just general. I just, it's speaking because you were talking
02:25:20 about how you're speaking to girls and stuff. Yeah. You know, you can force yourself to, you know,
02:25:26 change certain things like that, but they're like. Because that was hell. That was absolute hell.
02:25:32 Yeah, I mean, the change did happen eventually, some sort of, it did manifest in some way, but
02:25:36 they're like some things that are more core to you, like core personality traits. Sure, I agree.
02:25:42 I agree. That will, that linger to you. And it's like, maybe some people are managing to change it
02:25:48 legitimately, but some people might end up living a lie. And you just have to notice, you know,
02:25:54 which one are you? And at some point, and make the decision, do you want to keep living a lie,
02:25:58 or do you just want to try and be yourself and see where that leads you? I agree. I agree.
02:26:03 Anybody else?
02:26:10 Trying to think, if I've ever, I mean, I feel like, I feel like I have done a lot of
02:26:19 not doing that in the recent past, like a lot of like, meaning to like, oh, I'm gonna do this,
02:26:27 I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna start being like that. And just, it's not, not even that it doesn't
02:26:31 work. It doesn't, it's a total non-starter and doesn't happen. Yeah. That feels, that's, that's
02:26:37 been, that's been my, that's been me for a long time now. I think certain people just tend to like
02:26:46 be better doing things one at a time. Like, instead of regimenting their life in ways to,
02:26:53 to improve it, they should just set up situ, like, set up situations where in the future,
02:27:00 they know that they will likely do like, something in particular, like, I'm trying to think of an
02:27:07 example, but like, instead of like, regimenting your diet, having someone else force you to like,
02:27:14 or like, take, like, lock a certain cupboard so that you can't get something, and so you'll naturally
02:27:20 do something else, like, to set up your life in a way that you do what you usually do, but in a
02:27:28 way that benefits you rather than... That's kind of what I do. That's how I kind of get stuff done
02:27:33 with like deadlines, arbitrary, that are just like, like, for example, like today, I just promised
02:27:40 my girlfriend, because I thought it would be helpful, and it is, that I would count all my
02:27:44 calories today. She doesn't care. She doesn't give a shit. But for some reason, when I promise
02:27:50 someone that I will do something, it does get done. It's when I leave it kind of like, vague and up
02:27:55 in the air, like, yeah, like, I should definitely count my calories today. Then I just won't do it.
02:28:00 And I, but you know, once I promise someone, it gets done, gets done. I don't know. So that's
02:28:06 that kind of mechanism of tricking myself, kind of forcing myself to do it. But I just recognize
02:28:10 that I need that. I think if I try, I think if I try to promise things to people, I will just
02:28:18 avoid them.
02:28:18 It will end up, well, yeah, well, I think I avoid making promises in the first place in,
02:28:25 because I'm afraid that if I do mess up enough times, my promises will start to mean nothing.
02:28:32 And then I can't do that anymore.
02:28:33 That's kind of the motivating factor.
02:28:35 That's the stakes. That's the stakes that keeps you from breaking said promise, right?
02:28:39 Yeah.
02:28:39 Or that's the idea anyway.
02:28:41 For me, yeah.
02:28:43 Because like, I could promise that I will make a video or something, but then
02:28:49 I won't care about it at some point. And then I'm like, well, now I promised I would do it.
02:28:53 I do it with stuff that's like, when's Rayman 2?
02:28:56 Oh, no.
02:28:56 I do it with stuff like, like today, I promise I will go to the gym. Like, I've done that. And
02:29:02 Michelle, like, doesn't give a shit. It's just, it's helpful for me. Once I've said I'm doing it,
02:29:06 like, because this is something I want to do is not any more time than like, I wanted to spend
02:29:11 doing it anyway. And it's just like a regular thing. But it's just a helpful mental trick
02:29:16 that I use on myself.
02:29:18 Yeah. Like, people used to say like something similar, like back in school,
02:29:22 like when people wanted to cheat and, you know, write down
02:29:26 somewhere secretly, like the answers and stuff, like actually writing down those answers helps
02:29:31 you memorize them. So it's just the power of like, you know, saying it out loud or writing it down
02:29:36 is just like, makes it more official and it sticks with you a bit more than just thinking it.
02:29:41 Sounds rice to me. I said, it sounds rice to me because I'm currently adding brown rice to my
02:29:49 calorie calculator. Got them.
02:29:53 What sort of calorie calculator do you have? Is it like a mine or something?
02:29:57 This is called, you can get on your phone. It's called My Fitness Pal. And there's also
02:30:01 ones called Lose It and there's a bunch of them. But I like My Fitness Pal. And all it is, is it's
02:30:06 just a thing. You can, you type in like how many calories you want to eat for that day. So like,
02:30:10 that's, you know, you got to figure that out. But there's lots of tools to do that. And then you
02:30:13 just, you go in and like, whenever you eat a food, you just pull up the like, the diary, the tracker
02:30:18 and you type in, look, I had brown rice, chicken and broccoli for lunch today. So I'm typing in
02:30:22 brown rice, going to add that, how much I had, like, I had like a cup and a half or something.
02:30:26 That's like 150 calories chicken. It's like 200 calories and broccoli, you know, 20 calories,
02:30:32 something like that. Sounds cool. I'll actually try it out because I need to.
02:30:35 It is hugely helpful. Sounds. The issue with Lithuanian food, they don't actually list how
02:30:40 many calories. Unlike in England that everything has, yeah, everything has listed how many calories
02:30:45 the food has and like. Fuck them dog. Go outside the system and get this app. It's super helpful.
02:30:51 Yeah. Everyone, someone called everyone Bobo asks, when is Ben going full homeless boy?
02:30:58 What a puss. What a, what a bust. What a, what a puss. Oh, what a puss. I don't know what he's
02:31:05 getting at. Never. I'm actually fucking iron. Could you have that confused with Tom, perhaps?
02:31:11 I know. Maybe he's talking about me. I feel like maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Are you in, are you in,
02:31:17 are you in Braintree? I'm in local homeless. Yeah, that's true. I'm probably leaving tomorrow.
02:31:22 I think. That's what you said last week. Yeah. Things keep changing. I keep having to like,
02:31:29 my orders that I keep ordering to get all the last stuff for the card keeps getting pushed
02:31:34 back further and further. I'm like, oh, I guess not. Wait. Just be homeless, you coward. I know.
02:31:40 Is the house, is the house actually, are you actually kicked out of the house or are you
02:31:44 choosing? Like, are you just, are you staying until you get the car? Sounds like this is a downhill
02:31:50 slope, but he's going to have to leave eventually or something, right? It's, it's, it's complicated.
02:31:55 Yeah. Well, fair enough. Okay. Okay. Hey, I got a question. I got a question here. It's a good one.
02:32:01 Here it is. It's from Acid Biggie. And this is a deep one. Do you think the PCP is a good influence
02:32:09 on people? No, no. I saw that. I think, I think podcasts in general are a waste of time. What
02:32:19 if you do it? What if you do it while working out? That's true. That's true. What if you literally do
02:32:24 it while working out? If you're doing while doing something else, yes, but a lot of people don't
02:32:29 do that. Sure. Sure. I think that people are going to get whatever they're looking for out of it,
02:32:35 you know, like, it's entertainment, like most entertainment is, is, you know, just, I think
02:32:41 we have our good and bad moments. Feels time and it's fun, but like, I wouldn't say we're changing
02:32:45 people's lives in like, a profound way, except when they're depressed and they feel better. Like,
02:32:52 we're doing what entertainment is. Well, you know, one of my favorite things was this, this like fit
02:32:57 boy thing that we did recently with the fitness podcast and whatnot. And a bunch of people seem
02:33:03 motivated. And even if they only tried it out a little bit, the handful of people who did that,
02:33:08 I mean, it's pretty good. It's pretty good effect. Even if they just went for one job. Even if they
02:33:13 went for one job, they now have the experience of what a jog is like under their belt, if they've
02:33:17 never done it before, and they can build on that. You know, I think, you know, it's only one episode.
02:33:23 I think that it is, I think that it is, you know, I think it's like, I think people are going to get
02:33:29 what they're going to get out of it. I pretty much agree with that. People are going to get what
02:33:32 they're looking for. Yeah. Like if you're an art guy and you listen to this for like inspiration to
02:33:38 do more art, then like that's what you're going to get. Am I making any fucking sense here?
02:33:46 You are. You are. Like I think a lot of the people like, I don't know, would people who like, let's
02:33:51 say, let's say just like an insane person who has like a crazy worldview is going to listen to this,
02:33:57 like what's more likely that they'll like be converted to like, ah, yes, rational discourse.
02:34:02 Yes, everything's good. I mean, not that we even necessarily do that, but like if we did that,
02:34:06 versus, or they're just going to be like, well, I mean, I'm not going to listen to these guys.
02:34:09 You know, I'm out. I'm going to go listen to whatever validates my opinion.
02:34:14 That's probably what's going to happen, you know, for the most part, but it's the people
02:34:18 that you already got in your web that you can give positive messages to. Like our whole thing about
02:34:25 school, we can be a little bit over the top about how evil school is, but I do think it's an actually
02:34:31 good service to do to encourage people to be really critical of what they're going to get out of like
02:34:37 investing in an education, like a post-secondary education and, you know, saving themselves money
02:34:44 and, you know, try another stuff before committing on that, especially if they don't actually know
02:34:49 what they want to do. And you know, there's like things like that. Like I would, everyone thinks
02:34:53 they're a good guy in their own mind. I don't say anything except possibly as jokes, which I do a lot.
02:34:58 I don't say anything that I don't think is going to make the world better, like is true or good.
02:35:04 You know, again, unless it's like a joke, that's obviously for that purpose.
02:35:07 So like, I mean, I would argue that anyone who acts more like me is acting like in a more good way.
02:35:13 So like in that sense, I definitely think it's like a positive influence for people who...
02:35:18 You want people to be like you.
02:35:20 And I think everyone wants people to be like, well, okay, some people don't want that, but yeah.
02:35:26 Yeah. I see a question.
02:35:31 How much truth do you think there is behind the notion? Oh, this is like Kajoro Bitterthorn.
02:35:35 How much truth do you think there's behind the notion? You get more if you pay more.
02:35:39 What matters more to you? The objective or the experience around it?
02:35:43 Example, tasty cheat meal versus the same thing and a fancy restaurant with great ambiance,
02:35:48 presentation, etc. I think that you do not get more if you pay more.
02:35:55 Basically at all. You have to pay a small, a bit to get like good stuff,
02:36:02 like food that is actually nutritious and not bullshit, for example.
02:36:06 But beyond that very low requirement, I think that anything other than food,
02:36:11 anything other than nutriment to sustain your body and four walls and a roof over your head
02:36:17 is an unnecessary luxury and pure vanity and totally unnecessary.
02:36:22 And you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise.
02:36:26 I mean, I think he's... Oh, and a computer, and a fucking internet.
02:36:29 Of course. There you go. I did it.
02:36:32 The getting more doesn't necessarily mean like more bang for one's buck, but like more satisfaction.
02:36:41 Like is it better to just sustain yourself with food or is it better to have a lovely meal?
02:36:46 It really, I think it's a personal... That costs a lot.
02:36:49 I personally don't care about a lovely meal hardly.
02:36:51 Right. It depends on what you're looking for.
02:36:53 If you're someone who gets enjoyment out of that atmosphere and stuff,
02:36:56 and of course you're going to get more value out of that,
02:36:59 but if it's someone like me who doesn't give a fuck,
02:37:00 I'm just going to go there and feel uncomfortable and be like,
02:37:02 I'm just wasting my money, you know?
02:37:04 Yeah. Why did I spend $550 on this plate of asparagus?
02:37:09 For one of my friend's birthdays.
02:37:10 And I was disgusted over the fact that I have this dinky meal
02:37:15 that I'm cooking myself I have to pay $150 for. This is retarded.
02:37:19 Oh, like a Korean barbecue or something like that?
02:37:21 It was... I don't know. I don't think it's... It's like they just have...
02:37:24 Was it a fondue place?
02:37:25 Something like that, yeah.
02:37:26 Okay, okay.
02:37:27 It was retarded and I never want to go back in my life.
02:37:32 Yeah, I hear you.
02:37:33 Yeah, I don't like... A lot of the time, especially with food,
02:37:38 because you eat it and then you shit it and shit doesn't...
02:37:41 It's shit's not good, so I've ruined it.
02:37:43 I've ruined the stuff that I spent all this money on.
02:37:46 Well, it's not ruined.
02:37:47 Flush it down the toilet.
02:37:48 It's sustaining your body.
02:37:52 But like, I feel a lot of the time when I pay money that's expensive,
02:37:58 I think about how much I was ripped off and how cheaper it could have been somewhere else,
02:38:03 or like how if I went to the right shop where it's like a local family restaurant,
02:38:09 where they just do things better because they're like, you know,
02:38:12 the old lady with the Italian special recipe, she just,
02:38:16 hey, I'm gonna do the specialist sauce and she does the thing and it's like,
02:38:22 they do it cheaper because they're a small restaurant,
02:38:25 but they do it better because they're good.
02:38:27 And I'm like, if only I found that restaurant instead of wherever I am,
02:38:33 then it would be... I'm always thinking, fuck, they got my money and, dang it, I don't like...
02:38:40 You know, but there's something to be said.
02:38:41 It's a bad feeling.
02:38:42 There's something to be said for rolling up to a fancy restaurant,
02:38:45 you know, getting your tiny little slivers of meat in asparagus,
02:38:51 sitting across from a beautiful dame and looking out the window at you,
02:38:55 rabble, gazing in at me at this wonderful restaurant,
02:38:58 you know, just enjoying my superior, social superiority.
02:39:01 That's the best thing.
02:39:01 I'm looking through the window and I'm mocking you for being a fucking weed charge.
02:39:05 And I'm mocking you for being a poor boy.
02:39:07 Look at this child, look at this man.
02:39:08 It's not the having the thing, it's the knowing that others don't have it.
02:39:11 It works when you have, like, a significant other to take there to impress them.
02:39:16 But going there alone is like, what am I fucking doing in a restaurant?
02:39:19 Yeah, going alone is kind of... Okay, I want to...
02:39:22 My employee, like, I generally sort of, like, like the idea of sort of a fancy restaurant
02:39:27 and fancy meal, but at the same time, when I actually think about going to is like,
02:39:31 nah, man, I don't want to pay that much for that little.
02:39:34 And it's just like, I'm hungry, dude.
02:39:37 I want to have a nice, nice meal, but like, not for that much.
02:39:42 I like the aesthetics, I like the idea behind it,
02:39:45 but it's like fancy restaurants are usually mega super expensive.
02:39:49 So, no.
02:39:50 The fucking thing I hate the most is when I'm traveling and I'm in the airport and I'm like,
02:39:56 oh, I have to eat.
02:39:59 How much are they gonna extort out of me?
02:40:02 And it's like the shittiest food as well.
02:40:05 It's like a fucking panini in a microwave.
02:40:08 Five euros.
02:40:12 I usually go to the convenience store if there is one and get a pre-made sandwich
02:40:17 and a packet of crisps, and those are usually guaranteed to be normal and understandable
02:40:23 and edible.
02:40:24 I gotta go to the convenience store.
02:40:25 I gotta get me some of that zero calorie Arizona iced tea at Dollar Can.
02:40:30 You know what's good, though?
02:40:31 Guys, you know what's good, though?
02:40:33 Oh, you can eat buffet.
02:40:35 I love that.
02:40:36 Well, sure.
02:40:37 I never been told.
02:40:39 Oh, because he's a British boy, you know?
02:40:41 No, I've been.
02:40:41 Do they not have those in England?
02:40:43 No, they do.
02:40:43 I've never seen one.
02:40:44 I've been in one.
02:40:45 This is the first time I've been in an all-you-can-eat buffet was in England.
02:40:49 I actually, me and my boyfriend later, we sometimes go to Pizza Hub.
02:40:54 They have like all-you-can-eat pizza between 12 and like three or something.
02:40:57 No, from when they opened.
02:40:59 Oh, my gosh.
02:41:00 How much did that cost?
02:41:00 Just had the curiosity to get all-you-can-eat pizza.
02:41:03 For one person, it's 750 pounds.
02:41:06 So that's like, I don't know, $9, $10.
02:41:08 That doesn't sound bad.
02:41:09 That does not sound bad.
02:41:10 Like, the pizza, one single pizza is more pricey than the other pizza.
02:41:13 Yeah, exactly.
02:41:14 Nate, did you know that they have that at Papageno's now?
02:41:15 And I could eat much more than a single pizza in the same thing.
02:41:18 Nate, did you know they have all-you-can-eat buffet at Papageno's now?
02:41:23 They do?
02:41:23 What the fuck?
02:41:24 It's six bucks.
02:41:26 Six bucks?
02:41:27 Yeah.
02:41:28 What?
02:41:28 That doesn't make any sense.
02:41:29 Jesus, I have never been more happy back in New England.
02:41:31 They give you the slice pie slices, too, so they're big ones.
02:41:34 And you can also get pasta.
02:41:35 You know what they do?
02:41:36 You know what they're doing?
02:41:37 I've got it.
02:41:37 They're expecting you to have social anxiety
02:41:40 to prevent you from going up to ask for another pizza.
02:41:43 Ben, go to Papageno's.
02:41:44 Report back.
02:41:45 But you know that's not a problem.
02:41:47 Of course.
02:41:48 I've done it before.
02:41:48 We've gotten entire slice pies and then some.
02:41:51 That's great.
02:41:52 You guys should go.
02:41:53 The good thing about the Pizza Hut,
02:41:55 you just go get the slices yourself.
02:41:57 You don't have to bother anyone.
02:41:58 Well, see, I like that.
02:41:59 I do like that.
02:42:00 It is good.
02:42:00 That is good, Ben.
02:42:01 Less standing between me and my infinite pizza.
02:42:03 A lot of different pizzas as well.
02:42:05 I like to vary it up.
02:42:06 Biter just eats the one pepperoni pizza,
02:42:09 maybe margarita if they have margarita.
02:42:11 I like margarita.
02:42:12 I think the reason I've never been to an all-you-can-eat
02:42:16 buffet is because I don't eat that much.
02:42:18 And I don't think I would get.
02:42:20 I think I would actually lose money
02:42:22 by going to one of those things
02:42:23 because I would eat less food than it costs to get in.
02:42:26 It really depends on the buffet.
02:42:27 Another buffet I've been to that closed down
02:42:30 was the actual first one I've been to
02:42:32 when I came to live in England.
02:42:34 It was a Chinese food buffet.
02:42:36 And I just sort of dug into the food they had,
02:42:41 like what's it called, not snacks,
02:42:43 but the food you have before the main dish.
02:42:45 Appetizer?
02:42:46 Appetizers.
02:42:46 Appetizers.
02:42:47 Yeah, I really love the appetizers so much
02:42:48 I would just get my fill in appetizers.
02:42:52 Oh, man.
02:42:53 I went to...
02:42:53 But it was really cheap.
02:42:54 I went to...
02:42:54 It was like $4.50, I think.
02:42:57 I went out for Pokemon Community Day catching squirtles.
02:43:01 I got my fucking purple shiny Blastoise
02:43:04 with the sunglasses with the Kazi.
02:43:07 It was out with Kazi and the Busty Coins.
02:43:08 I got a bunch of squirts, but no shinies.
02:43:11 Yeah, they were...
02:43:12 You had the request.
02:43:13 The request that lets you do get like...
02:43:15 Man, what the fuck?
02:43:16 Son of a boss.
02:43:17 Whatever, boys.
02:43:18 Yeah, I got my fucking killer Blastoise.
02:43:20 It's sick.
02:43:21 Anyway, the point is I went to PF Chang's
02:43:23 and I just ate...
02:43:25 Doing keto, just ate fucking ribs.
02:43:27 I just got two orders of appetizer spare ribs.
02:43:31 I ate one, I got one for six bucks and I ate it
02:43:34 and I was like, that was great.
02:43:35 I want more food, but I don't want a side dish.
02:43:37 I'm just going to get a second set of ribs.
02:43:39 It was only $12 for like a shit ton of fucking ribs.
02:43:42 It was really great.
02:43:42 Sounds pretty good.
02:43:42 It was really great.
02:43:43 Highly recommended.
02:43:45 All right, enough.
02:43:47 This is almost three hours.
02:43:48 All right, he's right, he's right.
02:43:49 Oh, I need to go to bed.
02:43:51 That sounds good.
02:43:52 Oh, God.
02:43:52 And now I'm really hungry, but I have to go to bed.
02:43:54 Me too.
02:43:55 This is a terrible question to end on.
02:43:56 I haven't fucking eaten all day, so thanks, guys.
