00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:08 the best guy ever, and let's see what we've got going on here. Rubstands together greedily.
00:00:15 We've got Ben Saint. Fresh off his philandering and other podcast territory. And we've got
00:00:27 Tom Oliver.
00:00:28 There's some reason today I feel more financially solvent. I can't imagine why. Maybe you guys
00:00:33 have to figure that out, yeah.
00:00:35 Doesn't solvent mean to have fluidity of one's way?
00:00:38 What do you mean?
00:00:41 I thought financially solvent meant you were just more financially stable. You had more
00:00:46 income, or your finances were in order.
00:00:51 Apparently, I just googled it. Financial solvency means that an individual can pay all bills
00:00:55 on time with cash to spare.
00:00:58 You mean because there's only three of us?
00:01:01 Exactly.
00:01:02 Oh, of course.
00:01:03 That's very true.
00:01:04 Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
00:01:05 And I gotta let everybody know. We're up to a great start, because even if your stray
00:01:10 layabout, lazy-ass PCP member rolls on in, they've already incurred a hefty penalty on
00:01:16 their income. And that goes straight into our bank account, baby. So I could not be happier
00:01:22 about it.
00:01:23 I'm making hefty fees. So, not actually. But so you guys know, and I have to announce
00:01:30 this, I legendarily found the podcast and was on the Pizza Party podcast. I've been
00:01:39 there. I've seen it with my own two eyes.
00:01:41 I'm stressed.
00:01:42 Frankly, I think you're talking mad shit. I still don't, but I've never seen it with
00:01:45 my own eyes.
00:01:46 Go check out Rebel Taxi in the latest episode of the Pizza Party podcast.
00:01:49 That makes sense when you think about it. If the podcast takes place in a taxi, it's
00:01:53 constantly moving, how would we ever be able to find that?
00:01:55 Me and the boy, Cheesy Manfredo.
00:01:57 Fair.
00:01:58 Fucking around.
00:01:59 Well, frankly speaking, I mean, with the dimensional merge so well underway, is it surprising that
00:02:03 a fictional podcast would suddenly become all too real?
00:02:06 Like I said in this very chat, the night that Ben announced it, this is the most convincing
00:02:10 evidence for the dimensional merge I have seen so far.
00:02:13 Indeed.
00:02:14 I don't know. There's lots, I mean, there's lots of great evidence.
00:02:17 Well, I must tell you this, Chris.
00:02:19 He's not a custorian like you, so from my peasant eyes.
00:02:22 There's no shortage of evidence.
00:02:24 I was going to ask, I don't know, I thought I'd wait until now. I'm very curious as to
00:02:28 know how it is, not only that you discover the podcast, but we're then also on it, because
00:02:32 that, I mean, surely that's more than just a simple operation.
00:02:36 Well, I think Cheesy got on it, and I think maybe they told him like he could invite someone
00:02:43 else.
00:02:44 The lowly Cheesy Manfredo.
00:02:45 I don't really know exactly what the discussion was like.
00:02:48 I just know that he came to you and was like, hey, Ben, I got a spot on the Pizza Party
00:02:53 podcast and you can be on too if you want, and I was like.
00:02:56 So it was his initiative.
00:02:57 Yeah.
00:02:58 I see.
00:02:59 I see.
00:03:00 Yeah.
00:03:01 I was just along for the ride.
00:03:02 Do you have any idea what Cheesy's credentials or in what way he got on?
00:03:07 I just don't.
00:03:08 I didn't think he was much of a...
00:03:09 Well, I know that he bought like an ad on a previous episode, like he paid for a plug
00:03:15 for Bongo and Luna, and I'm not sure if maybe he just levied.
00:03:21 I think he, I don't know where, how it moved to.
00:03:25 Okay.
00:03:26 Funny story, it seemed like they thought that I was going to be like promoting my Kickstarter,
00:03:32 which like they delayed for two weeks.
00:03:34 So I was supposed to go on two weeks earlier, but for like two weeks, they were like, no,
00:03:39 we're not doing it.
00:03:40 So by the time we finally did it, the Kickstarter was ending that day.
00:03:44 So then I got into the call and I'm like, hey guys, what's going on?
00:03:48 And they were like, oh, don't you have a Kickstarter?
00:03:50 And I'm like, yeah, but it's ending today.
00:03:52 And they were like, what the fuck?
00:03:54 How are you going to promote it if it's ending today?
00:03:55 I'm like, I don't fucking know.
00:03:57 Were they angry?
00:03:58 Why are you asking me that stupid question?
00:04:02 I see.
00:04:03 Okay.
00:04:04 Yeah.
00:04:05 By the way, I know they run, they're into a tight ship over there like we do.
00:04:09 Perhaps not.
00:04:10 Perhaps not.
00:04:11 They were fine.
00:04:12 They were fine.
00:04:13 They seemed like, they seemed maybe not annoyed, but like confused and like, I don't know.
00:04:18 I don't know what I was supposed to say to that question.
00:04:20 They are in a totally different dimension than they usually are.
00:04:23 That must be jarring for anyone.
00:04:24 It seems like there's a pattern here or there's an expectation of behavior.
00:04:28 It sounds like their podcast is simply a vehicle for people or among other things, I'm sure,
00:04:33 to pay for ad space and like to find that you aren't there for that explicit purpose
00:04:38 is like a shock is an awe inspiring fact.
00:04:43 And I'm just thinking, why aren't we capitalizing on this obviously vibrant market to make vast
00:04:48 sums of cash advertising products we have no interest in or quality control over?
00:04:53 It sounds like the way forward for me, right?
00:04:57 This episode is brought to you by Squarespace.
00:04:59 Nate, have you heard that Squarespace is an online learning community and you can get
00:05:04 a month free from our affiliate link or something?
00:05:07 I don't know.
00:05:08 That's Skillshare, Ben.
00:05:09 You fucked up our sponsorship.
00:05:10 Shit!
00:05:11 I can't wait for that.
00:05:12 For that wonderful...
00:05:13 It's okay.
00:05:14 We got Purple Mattress lined up.
00:05:15 We got ExpressVPN.
00:05:16 It's all okay.
00:05:17 What's Purple Mattress?
00:05:18 There's going to be a glorious day where our patrons are paying us vast sums of cash
00:05:23 to advertise to them from other people who are also paying us for those advertisements.
00:05:27 Look, we already fucked this up.
00:05:28 I want to get them coming and going.
00:05:30 This is why our voicemail bot is failing us because right now we have a free avenue
00:05:34 for advertising.
00:05:35 We need to fucking clamp that down and put a price tag on it immediately.
00:05:38 You know, unironically true.
00:05:39 You know, speaking of advertising, this is actually an interesting thing.
00:05:43 I'm in...
00:05:44 Actually, I've been a little bit bad.
00:05:45 I've been a little bit unprofessional getting back to this guy.
00:05:48 But I was talking.
00:05:49 I don't know if I'm...
00:05:51 I probably just shouldn't say what company it is.
00:05:55 But I was talking with a company.
00:05:56 I just got a message on my email, best guy ever mailed or whatever, and it was a company
00:06:03 a little bit different from your normal shitty, like, hey, work with us, hey, advertise our
00:06:08 terrible thing.
00:06:09 This one is something I've used before, and I'm, at least in theory, kind of a fan of
00:06:15 the concept of, and their proposal was like, hey, do you want to not advertise, make a
00:06:21 video about this thing?
00:06:23 And I know Gibbs done that before about like his own.
00:06:24 Are they going to pay you for it?
00:06:26 I mean, that would be the idea.
00:06:28 Yeah, they'd give you actual money.
00:06:30 And I was thinking to myself, you know, Weagawa is a soulless shill product churned out to
00:06:35 make a product.
00:06:37 Churned out every week without fail.
00:06:39 That's right.
00:06:40 It's eaten up your entire creative uvra and has taken over your life.
00:06:44 Well, but Ben, I've made space finally.
00:06:46 I made a smash video about sands.
00:06:48 That was nice.
00:06:49 That's pretty good.
00:06:50 I've made space.
00:06:51 So what you're saying is we're going to get a fleshlight video very soon.
00:06:54 That's what I've gotten from it.
00:06:56 Here is the thing about it.
00:06:58 So I'm negotiating with these guys a little bit, and the important sticking point was
00:07:02 they were like, they wanted to be like 80% of like, I'll say like gameplay or like featuring
00:07:09 this thing prominently and it's not a fleshlight video, but I mean, it's in the ballpark kind
00:07:21 of it's like an adult thing, which I don't care about.
00:07:24 And obviously on YouTube, you can't make like actually pornographic videos.
00:07:28 So you have to like censor shit or whatever.
00:07:29 But I'm like, we are what isn't exactly that format.
00:07:32 Is it a porn game or something?
00:07:35 Can you tell us?
00:07:36 It's in that sphere.
00:07:37 Yeah, it's in that sphere.
00:07:38 Okay.
00:07:39 Like imagine it was me doing like a review of Sengoku Rants, which it's not, but it'd
00:07:43 be something kind of like that.
00:07:46 So I'm just, I don't know, I'm trying to think if it works out, but if it does work out,
00:07:50 it seems like I could make a good amount of money doing this.
00:07:53 So I'm very interested in finding a way to make this work.
00:07:57 But I don't know.
00:07:58 I've never done it before.
00:07:59 I'm a little nervous about credibility.
00:08:00 You just got to jump in, dude.
00:08:01 You just got to jump in, dude.
00:08:02 You just got to jump in.
00:08:03 You just got to jump in.
00:08:04 Your credibility is down the shit.
00:08:05 I mean, it's We Agua.
00:08:06 Your weekly show is not in here.
00:08:07 It's We Agua, so.
00:08:08 It's fine.
00:08:09 Yeah.
00:08:10 Half the audience won't even notice it happened.
00:08:11 They'll be like, I knew We Agua came out.
00:08:12 No.
00:08:13 That's absolutely true.
00:08:14 That's absolutely true.
00:08:15 Or you could just make a whole new show, like a show specifically for shilling things.
00:08:17 So the expectations are set from the beginning.
00:08:19 Well, We Agua was designed to be the shill show from the start then.
00:08:23 Then you're on brand.
00:08:25 You're on brand already.
00:08:26 It's true.
00:08:27 Well, speaking of shilling, I want to say one thing.
00:08:29 The Kickstarter for this weekend is the last weekend that I'll be accepting late PayPal
00:08:36 payments for Kickstarter donations for people who miss the Kickstarter.
00:08:39 I know there were some people who were messaging me during the campaign, like, I don't have
00:08:43 a credit card.
00:08:44 The website doesn't work or something.
00:08:47 Can I use PayPal?
00:08:48 And I was like, yes, hold on until after the campaign's over.
00:08:52 Now is the time.
00:08:54 So if you missed out on it and you're like, oh, maybe I should have wanted to support
00:08:59 my favorite online creators, then you have like two days.
00:09:04 You have until Sunday after you hear this.
00:09:06 And then I'm saying, like, fuck it, no more.
00:09:08 I'm glad the slimeoid has gotten over his fucking addiction and is now supporting you
00:09:13 financially.
00:09:14 You know, I forgot.
00:09:15 Me?
00:09:16 The swimeoid.
00:09:17 The swimeoid.
00:09:18 Oh, yeah.
00:09:19 Uwupiti.
00:09:20 Uwupiti, yes.
00:09:21 Uwupiti.
00:09:22 A charity case.
00:09:23 I want Uwupiti to hang out with tiny baby Ben St. and pall around and have a playday.
00:09:28 Well, I mean, I'm not sure if, I mean, the timeline has diverged.
00:09:34 There's a timeline where it died.
00:09:37 There's a timeline.
00:09:38 There's at least one timeline where it lives.
00:09:40 So at least two, I believe.
00:09:42 It's very confusing.
00:09:43 Well, I don't know, maybe the two, maybe the Izumi scenario and the red man scenario
00:09:49 happened.
00:09:50 Maybe, maybe Izumi fished him out and then, or fished it out and then something else
00:09:54 knocked it back in and then while Izumi was fighting against N7, that's when red man
00:10:00 put it in the jar.
00:10:01 I don't know.
00:10:02 Right.
00:10:03 It's hard to say.
00:10:04 It's hard to say.
00:10:05 We're just scholars of these.
00:10:06 We're just, yeah, we're just prophets.
00:10:07 We don't write this shit.
00:10:08 We just report it.
00:10:09 Had that happened last episode?
00:10:11 I forgot if we discussed the incredible amount of, of like, you guys all making different
00:10:16 shit about it.
00:10:17 I don't think it did.
00:10:18 That was like early this week, right?
00:10:19 Yeah.
00:10:20 I think, yes, yes.
00:10:21 I'm pretty sure I did that Tuesday, Tuesday or one day or something like that after reporting.
00:10:25 This has been my favorite thing about this whole saga so far.
00:10:28 I mean, you know, Chris did the whole genocide, excellent work, Chris, but now you guys all
00:10:33 making your different shit, like, and what I said, I mean, give me this comic, Ben was
00:10:37 doing his thing, really cool.
00:10:38 But then when I saw Tom making his like animated Izumi crossover, I want to know how long that
00:10:44 took Tom.
00:10:45 I want to know what was the inspiration because I was fascinated.
00:10:48 I must take it a hull.
00:10:49 Should we explain like what this is?
00:10:51 We probably should.
00:10:52 Yes, yes.
00:10:53 We should leave the groundwork.
00:10:54 So the final stretch goals for the Vapors 2 Kickstarter.
00:10:57 And don't worry, everyone.
00:10:58 We won't bore you with endless war talk.
00:11:01 It fills you with rage and piss and vinegar.
00:11:04 Audience, I literally hate you.
00:11:09 There was a, the final Kickstarter stretch goals.
00:11:13 I didn't really have anything else to do, so I made up a thing where like, oh, if we
00:11:16 hit this stretch goal, we'll make it a meme, that's the way, we'll send this Swymoy to
00:11:20 college.
00:11:21 We'll get him in education to increase his waver value and, and then they hit the goal
00:11:28 and I was like, well, shit.
00:11:29 I was like, well, he's looking to enter the workforce, but it's too much for a slime
00:11:33 like him.
00:11:34 He develops a terrible sludge dust addiction and now he needs to go to rehabs.
00:11:38 We got to send the Swymoy to rehab and we didn't make it.
00:11:44 He didn't make it.
00:11:45 So it was, it was over for poor little Uwupati and it decided that it had, it had hit walk
00:11:52 bottom and it had nowhere to go.
00:11:55 So it was about to dissolve itself in the slime way or in the, the, the, the, the, the,
00:12:00 the, the, the, the, the, the slime corp vats.
00:12:03 But how much did you make all told at the end of this?
00:12:06 Oh, 12,000.
00:12:07 So $12,000 exactly as much as I would get in one year under a Yang presidency.
00:12:14 So no more, no less exactly.
00:12:25 Literally it's like, it's like 50, well it's actually like, um, $12,000 and 50 cents, but
00:12:32 you can't see the 50 cents.
00:12:34 Yeah.
00:12:35 That's like, you know, you get your Yang money and then you happen to find a quarter a couple
00:12:37 times a year.
00:12:38 Yeah.
00:12:39 Yeah.
00:12:40 So, uh, we don't need Yang anymore guys.
00:12:42 We've solved the problem.
00:12:43 We just need a Kickstarter once a year.
00:12:44 Yeah.
00:12:45 Just vote Kickstarter for president.
00:12:46 Um, that's how he's going to get with the millennials.
00:12:49 He's got to get down with them like, no, this is, this is just a Kickstarter.
00:12:52 So yearly Kickstarter for your life.
00:12:54 We do it.
00:12:55 No more taxes.
00:12:56 We will, we'll end taxation.
00:12:57 We will just crowdfund like roads and like every end like hospitals and stuff.
00:13:01 Make it voluntary.
00:13:02 Yeah.
00:13:03 Um, uh, and, and, um, wait, what was I explaining?
00:13:08 So you were explaining how we disfigured to rehab her.
00:13:10 Yes.
00:13:11 He was going to dissolve and it was going to dissolve itself, but then hippo comes in
00:13:16 with a comic showing some mysterious red handed figure, saving it from and putting it in a
00:13:22 bottle.
00:13:23 And then Tom comes in with another, uh, a 3D, uh, model video, uh, showing a zoomie
00:13:31 comes in and fucking gives an inspiring anime speech and convinces it to want to live after
00:13:37 all.
00:13:38 Uh, oh, this was all after Chris.
00:13:41 Chris had responded saying like, don't guilt me, don't guilt me, Ben, Saint, don't, I,
00:13:46 I have foreseen all possible timelines and the timeline where the sly moid was survived
00:13:53 was terrible.
00:13:54 It would have been disastrous for everyone.
00:13:56 So hippo comes in and of course does it.
00:13:59 So the sly moid survives, but then the final panel is like, would have been terrible for
00:14:03 everyone.
00:14:04 Like the timeline is doomed.
00:14:06 We've doomed the timeline.
00:14:07 What do we do?
00:14:08 Um, this is all developing.
00:14:10 I'm like, I'm like, I was just making some more of this, this shit right before we started
00:14:15 recording and, um, I made some, I'm just like, I made some shit.
00:14:19 I put it out.
00:14:20 I'm just going to see how Chris reacts and then I'm just going to respond to that.
00:14:23 Right.
00:14:24 I have a couple, I have a couple of different ideas for like, for like how to resolve it.
00:14:28 Right.
00:14:29 Cause I need to convince her that this is happening.
00:14:31 I need to convince her that she needs to fear the events that may transpire.
00:14:39 So it's all highly reactive.
00:14:41 So Tom, just tell me how much did that take?
00:14:43 What kind of effort was involved in that animation?
00:14:45 Okay.
00:14:46 So I woke up at like 9am and I saw the tweet of the sly moid dying.
00:14:50 I was like, this cannot stand it.
00:14:51 I was like, I'll just do a little four panel comic doing something cute.
00:14:54 Were you in the middle of making it?
00:14:56 And then you saw hippos response and you were like, darn.
00:14:59 I did.
00:15:00 I did.
00:15:01 I did message hippo like 15 hours into working at it.
00:15:03 And I was like, you fucking bitch.
00:15:05 Cause like it started as a comic.
00:15:06 I'm like, no, comics on enough.
00:15:08 I got to go all out.
00:15:09 So I just said, I'm just going to throw this whole day away.
00:15:10 So for 20 hours straight, toiled over a hot blender and just made it all.
00:15:16 Damn.
00:15:17 It was an idea that went too far.
00:15:19 Uh, yeah.
00:15:20 How are you feeling?
00:15:21 It was super cool seeing that pop up on my feed though.
00:15:25 Yeah.
00:15:26 It came together pretty well.
00:15:27 Anything against the kill the kill soundtrack just automatically is good.
00:15:31 So I couldn't use.
00:15:33 You know, I suspect, I suspect this is my current fan fiction.
00:15:36 I think that, uh, our little whoopity will somehow travel back in time and like found
00:15:41 slime corp or some sort of, you know, like Bioshock infinite level, terrible plot.
00:15:46 Well, it wasn't that bad, but you know, there's clearly they have an important role to play.
00:15:52 No doubt.
00:15:53 No doubt.
00:15:54 My favorite thing about, okay, okay, whoopity is like, you can, okay, you can see it's brain.
00:16:01 Like you can see it's brain, right?
00:16:03 And my head cannon is that it is like literally just like a P is just like fluid.
00:16:08 It is just basically a sack of fluid with the thinnest of membranes surrounding the
00:16:14 fluid and just like the brain just kind of floating loose inside, just like you have
00:16:19 them lying on his side.
00:16:20 The brain is still oriented upright.
00:16:22 Yeah.
00:16:23 Clearly.
00:16:24 Cause the brain is fried from all the sludge dust.
00:16:26 So it's in there.
00:16:27 Just kind of like shaking around with the lightning bolts going like, yeah, the brain's not connected.
00:16:32 Like someone asked why it had a spine and I was like, cause what else would the brain
00:16:36 connect to?
00:16:37 But like the spine doesn't connect to anything.
00:16:39 It's just floating around in there.
00:16:41 I don't know if it's eyes are actually eyes or just like buttons that someone's stuck
00:16:45 on.
00:16:46 Whoopity is a mystery for sure.
00:16:47 I'm like actually upset.
00:16:49 I wasn't able to model.
00:16:50 The original idea was to model the brain and have like a particle system make the bubbles
00:16:53 and everything animate.
00:16:54 But I would have taken so fucking long, I mean, I don't blame you for just like make
00:16:59 it green.
00:17:00 Like you get it.
00:17:02 You should make Tom, I'm just going to throw this out there.
00:17:04 You should make some sort of like secret area in Izumi where you can break the wall and
00:17:08 you can find Uwupity in there with the model you've already made and you can just kill
00:17:12 them for some quick cash.
00:17:14 Secret boss Uwupity.
00:17:17 Oh, he gets a whole intro.
00:17:19 He gets a full boss bar.
00:17:20 But then there's one of those ones that takes one slash to kill and you got the big victory
00:17:24 fan.
00:17:25 Oh, like, like Zote.
00:17:26 Exactly.
00:17:27 Yes.
00:17:28 Exactly.
00:17:30 And then you can get another dream sequence like with Zote where he gets full power slime
00:17:34 oid mode and he's a big Chad.
00:17:36 These are all you.
00:17:38 You're welcome to all these ideas, everyone.
00:17:40 I encourage you.
00:17:41 I'm seeing from modest view.
00:17:42 I'm seeing maybe like a tiny little Uwupity, like sitting in the little cockpit of like
00:17:46 a giant mech or something.
00:17:48 Yeah, that's good.
00:17:49 Maybe that had built itself with its extensive education.
00:17:51 Oh, you know, that actually like that's seen from the last Jedi where fucking the robot
00:17:55 like what's what's the name fucking not R.C.B.
00:17:59 He's in the fucking Walker and it like it pulls off the Walker and just B.B.
00:18:03 Eight moving around the ATSC just to have a mech with a Uwupity.
00:18:06 Yeah.
00:18:07 Yep.
00:18:08 Yep.
00:18:09 Yep.
00:18:10 Yep.
00:18:11 Yep.
00:18:12 Yep.
00:18:13 Yep.
00:18:14 Yep.
00:18:15 Yep.
00:18:16 Yep.
00:18:17 Yep.
00:18:18 Yep.
00:18:19 Yep.
00:18:20 Yep.
00:18:21 Yep.
00:18:22 Yep.
00:18:23 Yep.
00:18:24 Yep.
00:18:25 Yep.
00:18:26 Yep.
00:18:27 Yep.
00:18:28 And I've met good he should they should it.
00:18:30 Oh, so much a draw comic of him like in Lecture Halls with a Temmie because they both went
00:18:34 to the same super fast school.
00:18:36 Obviously, one day education, 10 minute education, some.
00:18:40 I mean, especially in New Los Angeles City, like going to class is not really the point.
00:18:45 Just the point is just can you pay them enough.
00:18:48 And of course, that's how you get your diploma.
00:18:50 That's what it is.
00:18:51 That's what it means.
00:18:52 You had to be smart to get that money in the first place, right?
00:18:55 So like clearly you deserve the diploma.
00:18:57 Like I forget what since we live in a meritocracy and all that wasn't it
00:19:01 There's like something where it's like you want to get the ultimate. Oh, actually here's one example dragon ball Z
00:19:06 Is like you have to climb that tower. Sorry the beginning of dragon ball
00:19:09 You have to climb this tower to get the mystical water, but turns out the mystical water does nothing
00:19:14 It's the strength that took to climb. Yes, it was the strength that took to make a whole bunch of moneys in the first place
00:19:20 It's like you have learned
00:19:22 Of hard if you haven't learned about the shams of capitalism by the time you've saved up all that money
00:19:27 The lessons are lost on you anyway indeed indeed very true
00:19:31 All right, there you go, and you everyone put your time codes now to skip to the end of the endless war
00:19:39 Fuck you audience
00:19:42 God bless them
00:19:45 Disappointed in you every single episode
00:19:48 Uh, well, here's here's a small point. I messaged this in the chat the other day
00:19:51 I thought it was interesting, but people jumped down my throat about it a little bit
00:19:55 But that wasn't the point it was that I've noticed that a couple people have made
00:20:00 Smash videos not just in a similar style to me, but like
00:20:06 Ripping off the branding including the font and there's a couple of things going on here
00:20:12 I have no problem with people copying my style and doing the things in this way
00:20:17 When I start to have just a little bit of concern is when I see many many comments about well
00:20:23 Looks like BGE really shit this one out and just and that that's like the worst-case scenario
00:20:28 but many people just expressing some degree of confusion that
00:20:33 Clearly they thought this was a video by specifically these are all like banjo ones
00:20:37 there's like three ones that people have made and
00:20:39 I just it's I wish I have no problem with people doing this
00:20:43 I just kind of wish they would brand. There's a little bit differently
00:20:48 So it didn't just look like it was one of mine. I mean, but it's just like there's been on it
00:20:53 I feel like I mean, I feel yeah, I feel like that's probably not effective
00:20:59 marketing on their part
00:21:00 You don't think so. I think they're at the goal of making these videos is not to build their own brand
00:21:05 It's to get clicks off of yours
00:21:08 I mean a lot of them are clearly like up-and-comers. They're just trying to like do something fun
00:21:12 I don't have a problem with that. I don't think it's malicious
00:21:14 But I think the goal is to emulate your style as closely as possible because they know it works
00:21:20 Well, I mean, maybe if they're just starting out they like your videos
00:21:24 Maybe I mean, I guess probably the ideal what you would hope would happen is maybe they start out basically just making carbon copy
00:21:31 Best guy ever style videos and then they find their own style in that space
00:21:37 I mean, and of course, I mean did very true and did you of course said this to me
00:21:42 He's like wow Nate. You really think you copyrighted putting
00:21:45 Another person's like character on the thumbnail and putting the smash logo behind it. Well, no
00:21:51 I don't think I invented that or anything
00:21:53 But the font choice being the exact same font and it being a music like this kind of gives it away that it is in fact
00:21:59 There's a lot of specific choices that would all brought together again makes the influence clear
00:22:05 Yeah, yeah, and yeah, you like you might not own any of those things, but like
00:22:10 Yeah, it looks like a best guy ever video and I'm not an idiot. I'm not trying to say I copyrighted or I
00:22:15 Copy-acclaimed these people. It's it's just I mean take for example the fact that my first one the Ridley one was a complete
00:22:22 It wasn't a copy but like in the description. I say
00:22:25 inspired by
00:22:26 Demolition D and his
00:22:28 His berserk like getting off the boat video one of the greatest videos of all time. It's it's incredible
00:22:34 Deserves all its success demos the legend etc. etc
00:22:37 But and and you know some of the guys start their videos by saying like inspired by best guy ever like here
00:22:43 We go so like okay couldn't have a problem couldn't couldn't have less of a problem with that
00:22:47 but other people don't even mention me anywhere in the video and
00:22:52 are just
00:22:53 There but you know that I can't even get that mad at that because some people when they make their videos
00:22:59 They don't feel the need to like credit anything at all and I'm the complete opposite
00:23:03 I credit like every single link of everything I use and like all my videos
00:23:07 I don't need to but I just find it easy and I'm happy to do so some people
00:23:11 Just don't feel that need and maybe they still think like well
00:23:15 It's obvious. I'm you know doing a homage to this guy. So I don't it's hard to get in people's heads
00:23:21 And know exactly what they're thinking it is when I bring this up
00:23:24 It sounds like I'm like an angry complaining loser. Who's like these people are ripping me off
00:23:30 Well, I assure you viewers it is only an illusion
00:23:34 But but my my actual point here is to encourage these guys because you know what some other people came to me and said like hey Nate
00:23:41 I really like your videos like do you mind if I make a video in this style?
00:23:46 Some people actually reached out to me to ask me that and you know what I said to him
00:23:49 I said like fuck off. I said absolutely not pay me money motherfucker or whatever for 50% of your ad revenue
00:23:57 Actually, it's literally 0% ad revenue. Oh, by the way, give Gibbs said this was really funny
00:24:01 One guy puts a bunch of like things the beginning of his videos that are like. Oh, no
00:24:05 I got demonetized guys who could have expected that to happen. So I'm not making any money. So give my patreon
00:24:11 It's like yeah, what do you think this project is?
00:24:14 There of course is demonetized. We're stealing other people's music and making a montage. Okay, but whatever
00:24:19 I also plug my patreon
00:24:21 But some people reached out to me and they said like Nate can I do this my answer was I I didn't invent the concept of musical
00:24:28 Montages, I didn't invent the concept of like smash reveal videos or hype things or anything
00:24:33 But just put your own style on it would be the thing to do you can totally rip off the formula
00:24:38 I can't stop you. I have no right to stop you
00:24:41 I'd encourage you just to put your own creative spin on it as I like to think I have done with my videos
00:24:47 This is a humble request not a demand because I have no right to demand anything as you know
00:24:53 This is the internet. We all steal from each other and take ideas and whatnot. That's my that's my message to those to those fine folks out
00:24:59 There, but I mean if those guys hear this, I just I'm not mad. I don't care
00:25:03 I'm not upset about it
00:25:05 But just just consider these and as you grow and as a creator put your own spin on things
00:25:10 Don't don't make it so that like people have made collections of these
00:25:14 Like playlists of like the smash revealed videos or whatever and it's like all my videos
00:25:19 Then like a bunch of these banjo ones that are not mine and like one or two that are unrelated
00:25:23 But you can tell the unrelated ones are not made by me in it like instantly from the thumbnail and the title and stuff
00:25:29 Like I feel like that's where we should all be you know as a society
00:25:35 Yeah, there you go. All right, that's my point. Well point. It's like it's like it's like the same goes
00:25:40 You know imitation is a sincerest form of theft
00:25:45 I don't know
00:25:45 I feel like some people are gonna be mad at me or call me a whiny bitch about this as as some of the people in our chat
00:25:52 Seem to be but Nate aren't you just like happy that people are copying you and you know flattering you? Yes. Yes. I am
00:25:58 It's very nice. It's very nice, but I mean I guess to be a little selfish when I see that one of these videos has like
00:26:06 85,000 views and I'm just like damn
00:26:07 I have no problem with this guy making the video. It was pretty good and all that but like
00:26:14 I feel like at least some of these people
00:26:16 Were we're clicking on this because they thought it was my video and now you know, they've consumed this
00:26:24 Entire point
00:26:25 Yeah, I mean, that's why they did it. I think I think we've passed the point where
00:26:32 If you continue to complain
00:26:35 You start to sound the litch a little alright, okay
00:26:38 And you know as digi and other people said it's like a lot of people in those comments are like this will hold me over until
00:26:45 Best guy ever makes his video like so, okay, I get it
00:26:48 Not you know, I don't I'm not trying to be that that that annoying about I just thought it was something of interest to bring up
00:26:54 Because there's a fine line here of of I don't know
00:26:57 I don't want to say like acceptable versus unacceptable behavior
00:27:00 But like ideal versus, you know another person when that when people reached out to me and asked me
00:27:05 I had to kind of meditate be like what what would I want someone to do if they like were trying to copy?
00:27:11 I don't know just honestly like a thumbnail that doesn't look like it's totally copying my style and
00:27:17 Like it's funny because the the text of the description or of the of the title of the thing
00:27:22 I just put into like fancy text generator comm and was like which one of these like kind of looks cool
00:27:28 And I just picked one randomly. There's no meaning to it, but then other people like why are they using it?
00:27:33 I mean because I'm using obviously. That's the only reason you'd pick that font. So, you know
00:27:39 Just just funny to think about lads. I hope you've enjoyed this
00:27:45 Good well, there you go, that's what I have to say about that. Okay. All right, um
00:27:52 What else we got?
00:27:54 What else what else is going on Tom? What's what's new in your life?
00:27:59 Not much
00:28:00 Surgery on Wednesday
00:28:03 excited and by excited by the time people hear this it'll be over you'll be you'll be I'll either be cured or crippled
00:28:09 I guess we'll find out find out okay. Yeah, I don't I don't you know
00:28:13 This is perhaps a sensitive topic don't want to push you to talk about too much about if you're worried or uncomfortable like
00:28:19 Will you know if things have like improved or not improved like very soon after we'll take a while to like, you know
00:28:26 From what I understand it should you want to tell us like what they're doing to you
00:28:30 They are doing surgery on my spine because I have a herniated disc is maybe unable to walk since January pretty much
00:28:37 Yeah, as some of you have seen firsthand
00:28:42 So they're going to knock me out open up my spine and pull out bits of my spinal cord
00:28:48 They're currently interrupting the nerves in my back that are fucking things up. Very nice. Yeah, it's a good time
00:28:54 Very nice. Yeah, so I guess the idea is that you pull out these pieces of bone
00:29:01 And I won't have the pain anymore
00:29:03 But if something goes bad, they could sever the nerves in my spine and paralyze me. So oh my god
00:29:08 I thought it was your sciatic nerve like in your legs
00:29:12 It is that's where the pain is coming from but it's because there's there's the disc in my spine has slipped and it is hitting the nerve
00:29:19 That affects the sciatic nerve because it like runs down your spine into your leg
00:29:23 I don't know. It's some weird biology. Why don't you just go to a chiropractor because they're all about like
00:29:29 Controlling the flow of energy up and down your spine. Well, it sounds like they are designed for this problem
00:29:35 I don't know why you're using this quote-unquote
00:29:38 standard medicine this
00:29:40 Mainstream solution. Well, Ben as someone who's been suffering with this for a year. I've gone to the chiropractor multiple times
00:29:47 I've gone to physical therapy. I've gone to I've tried everything. I've tried
00:29:53 My guy will hook you up
00:29:56 Yeah, I don't know about any of that
00:29:59 Seems a little it's a little too mainstream for me
00:30:01 I guess I'm more of an indie guy. I got it. I got it. I've had some seances with witches
00:30:07 Yes, good. Good. No no luck so far. Have you perhaps prayed to the great Satan for for benefit
00:30:14 I'm trying to Satan every day just about everything. All right. We're okay. I don't want to be overly negative here
00:30:22 But just this at all utterly terrify you because I feel like it would me constantly. Yes, okay
00:30:28 Yeah, all the time. Well, very paneled like this like the problem. I've heard about people having herniated discs before
00:30:36 I feel like this has got to be a somewhat common procedure. Yeah
00:30:39 I mean the talk from from the surgeons like yeah, this is like probably the best surgery
00:30:43 I do with the highest rate of success the problem is like this is already like a huge phobia of mine already
00:30:48 so like surgery in general as
00:30:52 Just just like anything to do with my spine or brain or like cuz that's like
00:30:56 Yeah, yeah alive right brain shit fucks me right up dude. I saw a post on Twitter someone trying to get get a voyage
00:31:04 That brain shit as much as
00:31:06 Tell me about that there's a metaphor in a whoop-a-dee's design somewhere
00:31:10 I'm sure like there was there was a post on Twitter someone trying to get thing help for their medical bills
00:31:15 And I guess yeah something had happened to their neck
00:31:17 The the bones in their neck had shifted and their brain was falling out of their skull as a result
00:31:27 Yeah, it was fucking my god, yeah, yeah, I'm googling brain surgery images right now
00:31:33 Ah
00:31:35 Yeah
00:31:40 That this is why I'm
00:31:43 Transhumanism hashtag H plus get us out of these flesh prisons now. Well, I mean
00:31:50 I mean this reminds me of a couple of things in in ghost in the shell land of cyber brain
00:31:55 Ah, what not they do have to I believe fully remove the brain
00:31:58 And then they put it into like a casing that can be like moved around easily between skulls
00:32:04 So, I mean there is brain surgery going on there for sure, but yeah
00:32:10 Yeah, that's just not as scary
00:32:12 No, I mean it would be scary because like then you also have to like wonder like well
00:32:17 I still be the same thing like it's still my brain
00:32:19 Yeah, like is there something that's lost your transition. Yeah, but but once you the benefits the benefits are yeah
00:32:25 That's true. The benefits way too big to I'm like you're basically like, you know a god at that point a god
00:32:31 I mean just look at look at Tom for example
00:32:33 I mean he could literally put a cyber brain in a new body in a situation like this and then what I think the thing
00:32:39 That really fucks me up is that I wouldn't even be so weirded out by being like an organic biological being if we could synthesize organs
00:32:46 Easily because like the problem is like we don't have we don't we can't just like bring ourselves to the hospital and be like
00:32:53 Yeah, my heart's broken. I need a new one. It's like all right pay me like a couple hundred bucks
00:32:57 We'll you know, we just grow you a new heart
00:33:00 I guess we fantasize a little bit that we're farther along in this developmental process of medicine and whatnot
00:33:06 But we're actually very primitive in the things that we can do watch watch the original Star Trek and then like yes
00:33:13 Like even back then like the ideas that they were having for medicine are still far beyond anything we can ever do like their ideas of
00:33:20 Technology have been obliterated by modern devices, but the medical field is still
00:33:26 Laughably behind the concepts from the 60s. So you know, it's just ridiculous
00:33:31 Like I'm going I really they're gonna carve pieces of bone out of my back by cutting through the flesh
00:33:37 It's like what the fuck this is some medieval shit
00:33:40 Did I mention the last piece of the episode the the situation of like Ron Weasley discussing his views on human doctors or muggle doctors?
00:33:48 Did I did I bore everyone with this last time? I don't want to repeat myself
00:33:51 I don't remember it's very quickly. It's just that Ron Weasley this privileged wizard fuck with literally magic blood
00:33:58 When when Harry went with him to like the wizard hospital and like book two or whatever
00:34:03 They were like
00:34:05 Harry's who grew up, you know with muggle people was like all these wizard doctors Ron and Ron was like no Harry
00:34:11 What those muggle natas that cut people up? No, they're healers
00:34:15 So it's like he's literally shaming muggles because of the best stuff
00:34:19 They've got science real shit. Your god isn't real Ron. Fuck you
00:34:24 You know because we don't have magic the wizards keep their their advanced medical
00:34:28 Technologies and leave us all the suffered and die of cancer really says a lot
00:34:32 I mean Harry Potter has
00:34:34 Like weird ramifications of this like secrecy of their entire society when you really make it like a real thing
00:34:41 Well, it's because the book started off as like kind of like cutesy children things exactly
00:34:45 They got older and then when you start dealing with more complex topics
00:34:49 I'm not actualizing things and more you're like wait a minute
00:34:52 We made it too real things get teenagers everyone's starting to get a little horny and you know from there things just go straight down
00:35:01 Well god damn I hope it goes well and I want to know as soon as possible things go
00:35:07 Well, and if anything I mean good or bad if you need our help Tom
00:35:10 We'll we'll here I am to virtue signal that we can perhaps be of assistance in some way
00:35:15 I mean just if terrible things happen and lots of money is required boom
00:35:21 We got an audience we got we'll we'll make a Kickstarter or we'll make it go fun me whatever man
00:35:25 I'm sure people will be willing to help I'm hoping mass health will cover the majority of whatever this fallout is and force comes to worse
00:35:32 Maybe I can sue the hospital for millions and damages for malpractice
00:35:36 You can make this work for you
00:35:38 Let's just say you need an extra thousand dollars
00:35:41 I don't see any reason why if you like you're I don't know you're paying the bills you got your your
00:35:46 Your your not tax your fucking benefits or whatever from the the health care or whatever
00:35:50 But if you need an extra like five grand, that's a thing for Kickstarter
00:35:54 That's a thing for just the kindness of man to help out with yeah, this is not your fault
00:36:00 This is literally the role of the fucking dice. What a great system we got going on in America right now
00:36:06 Yeah
00:36:08 They could use a little bit of work
00:36:10 capitalism has some problems it could use a violent revolution
00:36:18 Hate the corporations and hate the government the most are also the ones who are anti-gun we're never gonna see a violent revolt
00:36:24 It's such a shame
00:36:25 well
00:36:26 Perhaps perhaps that's why
00:36:28 I
00:36:41 What if I can charge for entrance to like my antifa weapons training program
00:36:46 So I can make a pretty penny off of arming though
00:36:48 That'll work for a while until they seize the means of armament from you that you know, you're not wrong
00:36:55 Well, there you go, there you go, there's the update there
00:36:57 We joke about all this but
00:37:00 Shout out to nexus mania in Chile right now where things are fucking really fucked up. Oh my god
00:37:05 Well, dude that like yes, it was fucked for him
00:37:09 I don't know exactly what's going on in Chile. There's there was like some protests
00:37:13 I guess the government shut it down into a there's a curfew now
00:37:17 There's military on the street that's armed fucking with people
00:37:19 I haven't looked into it too much because that shit fucks and creeps me out, but uh, yep
00:37:24 Feel the same way please don't die
00:37:28 I'm thinking about you thoughts and prayers
00:37:31 Thoughts and prayers bro thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers
00:37:36 You know, we did it we got a voice
00:37:38 I won't well we'll play it later, but there was a voicemail irrelevant to the situation that perhaps will be a salvation
00:37:44 For nexus in this situation. I don't know unless they they've closed almost certainly. I don't know. I don't know
00:37:51 But oh boy, yeah, yeah with like that and many other unhappy things happening in the world
00:37:57 I'm like, ooh
00:37:59 Like if I worked really hard, maybe I could help but I got like a lot of dishes to do today
00:38:04 I got like a lot of chores to handle so
00:38:08 You know just got to keep it 100 keep it focused on number one over here. So good luck everybody out there
00:38:15 You know unironically there's a there's probably some kind of equation to be found
00:38:20 Of it's appropriate to spend a certain amount of time worrying about the rest of the world
00:38:24 And a certain amount of time worrying about the shit you got to deal with in your life
00:38:28 I don't know what that ratio is well
00:38:30 There is not 100
00:38:31 There's a school of thought that says you take care of yourself first because once you're in a good position
00:38:35 You're you're more effective at taking care of the world. I think they call that objectivism at least it's part of the ethos of
00:38:42 objectivism
00:38:43 Maybe I haven't read Anne Rand. Those books are big. Those books are good. I think
00:38:50 I mean Rand is literally a fucking psycho. Hey, hey, no, no, thy enemy Ben. No, thy enemy, right?
00:38:56 And I found them enjoyable terrible terrible mindset from a terrible woman. Oh
00:39:01 She lived communism Ben. She's allowed to be mad at it and to you know
00:39:06 Okay, you know all those books were just a temper tantrum about being well mad about communism
00:39:13 Some of our greatest art has been the product of temper tantrums. I give you sonnachu volume one
00:39:18 Rage against the yeah rage against the garbage. All right. That's fair. That's fair
00:39:24 Can't argue with Christian, but the Anne Rand of our time. I guess
00:39:31 Man I got the I got a fucking mm-hmm. I just got a fucking keep I just got to keep Chris
00:39:38 Interested I just got to keep it. I gotta keep it funny
00:39:42 Of course the Chris just keeps like coming up as long as Chris is still coming up with no
00:39:46 No, no, no, this happened in this universe. No, no, no, no, the slime is doing this and this is what's going as like as long
00:39:52 As that's going on
00:39:54 I gotta say as a bystander it's interesting watching the diplomatic relations continue to break down week over week
00:40:00 It is it is interesting. Um, they're not it's it's not over until I'm fucking blocked and even then
00:40:07 Even then I have options. Now. I suppose I'm curious Ben at this point of the equation
00:40:12 Are you at all, you know getting into the the thoughts of like am I perhaps taking this a little bit too far?
00:40:19 Am I no, no, no, okay. Okay. No, I ain't no bitch
00:40:23 I have a question related to that. How are those scripts going for the vaporettes?
00:40:27 Uh, well, I got two of them out
00:40:30 All right, how many are them?
00:40:32 Six oh
00:40:34 I think I might rewrite one or two
00:40:38 I think maybe that means none are done
00:40:41 No, no, no, no, no the ones that I got out to the artists are set in stone. Oh, okay
00:40:46 I'm happy with those. I must say other ones who I'm like, am I really happy with these just like could I improve these?
00:40:52 Am I
00:40:55 Don't don't beat yourself up about them too much try to get them to a workable state
00:40:59 Then maybe consider just giving them to the artists and let them
00:41:02 Possibly make some small changes to the script because you know, they have a creative voice that perhaps could bloom. I guess that's true
00:41:09 Yeah, I don't know. I'm sad that my dream of a chris chan vaporette from two weeks ago is all but dead now
00:41:15 Unless there's a big
00:41:18 I did say that a couple episodes ago. I was like, oh man, vapor's three
00:41:22 Oh, you know, she never would have fucking done it, you know
00:41:25 It's I mean to respect chris to deliver on a deadline, you know for a certain amount of money and not just demand extra money for no reason
00:41:32 Never fucking do it. You would never do it
00:41:37 I mean, she she made you that that page that you paid for, you know, that was it's true deliverable
00:41:42 It's true. It's that did happen. Um, but I think I'm in the minority of people who actually got what they paid for
00:41:49 Really? Hmm. I I mean, everyone says she doesn't deliver on her kickstarter on her like, uh, uh
00:41:56 Paypal or you know patreon obligations and stuff and doesn't you know
00:42:01 Screws people out of commissions and stuff. I don't know. I don't know fair enough
00:42:06 My one experience was through you getting it successfully. So that that made me think like, oh, wow
00:42:11 Yeah, and that was fine. So I get maybe you know
00:42:17 Thumbs up one of those ones five stars. Give her a good yelp review. Now. That's what you call customer service
00:42:24 Uh, let me see what else is going on the saga of sesho exercise and thinning uh continues
00:42:32 I'll have everyone know I accidentally gave him two dinners the other day. It was a it was a mistake
00:42:39 All progress is lost
00:42:41 What have you done?
00:42:43 I need to really kill him. It was an early dinner situation
00:42:47 I forgot and michelle was like did you feed sesho yet? And I was like, uh, I don't think so
00:42:53 But alas I had so you get a system going
00:42:56 We will you know, we should make like a whiteboard and like check it off when we fed sesho and maybe exercise him every day
00:43:03 You know, some people are saying some people have to voicemail. I didn't play because it was fine
00:43:06 But it wasn't wasn't up to par of like you should go running with sesho. Now you should go running with sesho
00:43:11 I could like try that. I suppose but sesho is a very
00:43:15 He like sesho doesn't play fetch some people are saying play fetch with sesho sesho does not fetch
00:43:20 He could perhaps be convinced to perhaps one way chase. He's he's a broken boy. He's a broken mind
00:43:27 This is what happens when you make your dog
00:43:29 Rotund as you have it was from day one sesho was like this
00:43:33 You know sesho's a very demure soul a very demure soul like his namesake lord sesho maru himself
00:43:39 Doesn't speak much very quiet. We'll occasionally do some mild grumbling and uh, doesn't doesn't fetch doesn't run much
00:43:46 Except sometimes we'll just run around the house. No reason to find out that his younger brother has the tetsaiga and that would give him all the motivation he needs
00:43:54 That's to raise his yokai power level to overcome him and uh and seize the means as as it were that'll be good
00:44:00 Okay, well, you know, we have been thinking about you know, I'll give you guys a teaser
00:44:04 Perhaps I shouldn't spoil this because one day I feel like it'll be a long time before this comes of fruition
00:44:09 But me and michelle this is michelle's idea
00:44:11 We've long thought about eventually perhaps soon getting another dog for sesho to play with and to hang out with because we both
00:44:16 Just love dogs. What a fucking nightmare. I'm stressed out just thinking about it
00:44:21 I feel like having one dog is like 90 of the work getting a second dog is only like 10 extra, you know
00:44:27 So we're already yeah, that seems like some slippery slope logic
00:44:30 Well, it's not a child. So their lives don't matter. So I'm not that worried about yeah
00:44:34 Yeah, if you change your mind you can always take them out back behind the barn
00:44:38 Yeah, that's all right. So so here is the um
00:44:42 The the name we we are thinking about it's not inuyasha as people may think that that would be too boring
00:44:47 And this is michelle's idea. It's we're thinking of kagome
00:44:52 It's we're thinking of calling him odi for short which stands for
00:44:56 Left arm of the forbidden one exodia is would be the full name of
00:45:02 Showers
00:45:04 Left arm of the forbidden one a.k.a.
00:45:06 Left arm of the forbidden one exodia a.k.a. odi for short. All right, isn't that right? That's pretty good. That's pretty fucking funny
00:45:15 It is that was all michelle. She's a she's a funny lass
00:45:17 Patreon her for more epic memes on her patreon, which she does not have but one of these days
00:45:24 Um, we all right. Well, you know, let us know when you actually go through with it. I guess we'll do
00:45:30 I wonder if people will remember and uh, keep uh, give us your hot suggestions in the description down below
00:45:35 Vote in my straw poll for what to name my second dog that I don't have
00:45:39 The current fictional dog that may cross the dimensional merge
00:45:42 He may just cross over that dimensional merge right now
00:45:44 Send us fan art of odi so that he can then become real through the dimensional merge
00:45:49 It could be in your backyard right now for all we know
00:45:52 There is
00:45:53 There's so much this dimension the dimensional merge. There's so much possibility space
00:45:58 So much there's so much possibility space about where yeah, we're we're gonna take things
00:46:03 Um, I'm I'm I'm constantly walking on the razor's edge
00:46:06 I figured out your end game of all this by the way this morning. I had the brain blast
00:46:10 It's like, oh, I see the whole point of this entire endeavor
00:46:14 Is that when the inevitable chris chan part two lecture has it has to by default have a sub lecture of endless war
00:46:19 You've injected there it is man. There it is
00:46:22 And then it'll reach already it's already there
00:46:25 It's already there because already on the quickie of the slime the slime related
00:46:31 Arizona slime card updates for the Twilight Sparkle secret shipfic folder
00:46:37 Are already listed as sonichu special number six, so it already has its own side chapter devoted to it
00:46:43 So there's nothing I can do. I literally must
00:46:46 Devote a section of the lecture to it. It's canon. I mean, it's a hundred percent canon
00:46:52 How could you give the lecture a nod address? Yeah, no, I would be sure I would be
00:46:56 You negligent in your in your christorianly duties. No doubt. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I would be remiss not to not to have a section
00:47:04 so
00:47:05 You know, I've already won
00:47:07 well
00:47:08 I feel like that right there is the not so good news. We just heard about on the web and perhaps
00:47:14 We should move on to to the voicemails
00:47:17 We've got we've got like 12. We've been going for like 45. Did I mention did I mention that I have a quickie article?
00:47:23 Yeah, we said it was the article of the now last time it was it is no longer the article of the now, but it's still there and
00:47:29 It's the article of the
00:47:32 But it's all it's got it's got the template. Oh, it's some other guy who has been like making
00:47:40 Kickstarter campaigns or gofundme campaigns to like raise money for
00:47:45 And like they've all failed. I don't know. I don't know what his deal is and I don't really care
00:47:48 Okay, fair enough
00:47:49 But I my article has that little mark. It has a little star has that template at the top
00:47:53 It's like this article was once article of the now I can never they can never take that away from me
00:47:58 They can never take away the touch the poop that'll be on
00:48:02 I did I sure did it's stink the stink is on me boys
00:48:08 Uh, I mean if you guys are down, I mean I pretty much burned through I'm think we're a little bit light on
00:48:13 individuals with human capital to expend today
00:48:16 That's true. Uh, well, I mean
00:48:20 The Kickstarter got into a little sunday for that. Um, uh, I went to uh, I did go to um
00:48:27 The massachusetts independent comics expo yesterday. Oh, yeah, okay with kazzie and uh, munchie
00:48:35 And uh, I hate it. It's all why really it's bad. I don't like it
00:48:39 It's just it bothers me that all you do there is buy stuff
00:48:43 It's only a place for I mean there are panels. None of them seem like actual comics
00:48:48 They've made or like bullshit corporate merch or something. Well, yeah, I mean they are independent creators and I mean that's cool and all
00:48:54 But like you just go that you you buy their comic books. You buy their
00:48:58 You know prints they made I don't want any of that stuff. I don't want this mythical networking
00:49:04 Be a part of the experience in some way where I would be interested in that
00:49:07 But like I don't know how you're supposed to do that
00:49:10 Like I met like I met abby howard, right and like last year
00:49:13 Last year abby howard was there
00:49:16 And and I didn't say anything to her but this year she was just walking by me and I was like, oh abby howard
00:49:21 Hey, I know you I know you from that stuff search. Yeah
00:49:24 We had a you know, we talked she was like, oh, yeah my table's downstairs
00:49:28 And you know, I was like, oh cool. Great to meet you. She walked away and I was like, what was the point of that?
00:49:33 Like what have I what has anyone gained like this sucks like this whole endeavor is useless
00:49:39 I wish I I wish I never left you know, I wish I never left my house. What a fucking
00:49:44 What a fucking nightmare the problem and I never and I never felt and I never felt more alone than I did
00:49:51 In public at mice out at this thing
00:49:53 Is that where the tweet came from where you said you felt alienated or is that a different
00:49:58 Although that's it certainly didn't help now that was after ben's abduction by aliens and he was feeling real alienated
00:50:05 I never felt more alone than I was at mice and like here I am at this event that like this event seems like it's
00:50:11 Literally made for someone like me and I'm here and there is like zero
00:50:16 I feel zero purpose in being here. I feel zero camaraderie with anyone else here
00:50:20 You know, they this is a nightmare
00:50:22 They say that human beings feel their loneliness when like in cities surrounded by people who know, you know, who they know
00:50:28 None of as opposed to
00:50:29 Or smaller little communities when they can know a couple people that makes sense
00:50:33 You get the sense of tranquility when you're actually by yourself indeed indeed
00:50:37 Anyway, so
00:50:39 I didn't like it is the short version of that story
00:50:42 I mean, I guess my thing is if you weren't going there to either a
00:50:46 Have a table yourself because then you actually have a purpose or b
00:50:49 You wanted to go get a bunch of fucking independent comics from a bunch of creators. Like yeah, it does seem pointless to go
00:50:55 What yeah, why go just to waste money or waste money, you know
00:50:59 Because like the that the boston comics round table had a table and i've been
00:51:03 I've gone to a couple meetings lately. I don't know if i'm gonna go anymore. It sucks. It's fucking pointless
00:51:10 I mean if you're gaining nothing fair enough, I suppose. I'm gaining nothing
00:51:13 Uh, they're they're I went I I've been saying like maybe I want to like sit at their table and like, you know
00:51:20 You can sell your shit like I could have brought some of my comics and sold
00:51:24 But like they had all bunch of shit on the table
00:51:28 Like like mine would have just been like one book among like 20
00:51:31 So like i'm sure I wouldn't have sold very many copies of anything. I don't think it would have made me any money
00:51:36 I don't think it would have increased my ability to network with other
00:51:41 Creators because I just would have been sitting behind a table
00:51:43 um
00:51:45 That's kind of like the reason I've never wanted to vent at conventions or anything like that because it just feels like
00:51:50 Oh, I'm just sitting behind a table while all this other cool stuff is going on everyone's walking around
00:51:53 I could hang out with my friends, but no i'm behind here at a table and I can't move for the entire weekend
00:51:58 Just seems interesting. I don't know they say they say they talk about operated for you
00:52:02 You know they talk about networking, but I don't know
00:52:05 I mean
00:52:06 Then you had the galaxy brain move of like starting a kickstarter online and accessing an international audience and made $12,000
00:52:13 I'd gout anyone like the better plan between the two. I mean
00:52:18 Yeah, space is just old school
00:52:20 I mean it took me like it took me like six years of fucking audience building and whatever
00:52:25 But you know other than that little hiccup it's like it's like what could be simpler
00:52:29 Well, I mean, I don't know six years of grinding in the real world would get you far less results. I feel
00:52:36 You could make more than $12,000 just working a job
00:52:39 Well, I mean, I mean, I mean making comics. I mean making
00:52:42 Oh
00:52:43 In that case
00:52:44 Real life possibly yet. That's fair. That's that's possibly fair. I mean, I would definitely encourage people
00:52:50 If they're making a they're trying to be successful at some, you know
00:52:54 artistic endeavor of any stripe
00:52:56 To acknowledge the financial reality of how they need to survive and work a job in addition to doing that thing
00:53:02 Which is what I did and maybe yet again all too soon
00:53:06 If I'm not making enough money and stuff
00:53:08 It just seems like a practical way to live but uh, you know, whatever I can respect those who just jump
00:53:13 Both feet in let me sink or swim. Let me talk about let me talk about
00:53:19 Assholes on twitter who don't like my tweets, right?
00:53:23 And it's your girlfriend and digi's girlfriend. Michelle and may okay. They're bullying gang
00:53:29 Just just gang up on me and bully me on twitter. There's such shit lords
00:53:34 Love to be mean to you. I don't know just so you know
00:53:38 I worry sometimes that people think that I'm like sending michelle out as like a no, no, no
00:53:42 I never do that. No, I don't I didn't think that this time
00:53:46 In the past I've wondered like isn't it in on this but this time like I know this is just I mean what she does
00:53:51 Is she will say Nate? I'm telling ben what a fucking retard he is right now and I go. Okay, michelle. That sounds nice
00:53:58 Yeah, you know things of this. Yeah
00:54:00 It's terrible. It's terrible. She's she's not she's it is funny who but she has she has cowered tactics
00:54:07 Cowardly debate tactics. She only she only did police is my tone. She won't debate me
00:54:13 She won't let me own her ass with facts and logic
00:54:17 I don't just say oh you sound like uh, you sound like an old you sound like such a boomer the way you phrase that
00:54:22 Ha ha who would phrase the thought that way idiot. I can't argue with that
00:54:27 prerogative is definitely to be a be a trickster and a jokester and to laugh at vulnerable individuals
00:54:34 And then I say, you know, I like fdr. I like fdr
00:54:38 Economic policies and may is like is japanese ben. She is japanese her people are locked away in those concentration camps
00:54:46 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean michelle, isn't he? I mean, yeah, there was that
00:54:49 May was on my ass about she locked away the concentration camp who cares bro get over it, right?
00:54:55 How long ago was that? Yes, literally who okay? Well, I wasn't even talking about that
00:54:59 I like his economic policies. Obviously. I don't like the internment camps, right?
00:55:02 But I'm just saying fdr fucking tax the rich to shit and I think that's awesome
00:55:08 And uh, you know pretty pretty cool stuff
00:55:11 Doesn't invalid doesn't invalidate that other things he did were bad
00:55:15 I don't think may I don't like may's take on the whole thing. She's trying to tell me that I'm wrong and I don't think that I am wrong
00:55:23 And the point is that I hate women. That's it
00:55:26 Understood understood. Yeah, you know
00:55:29 And the and the jews and the japanese I guess of course considering our different
00:55:34 I don't know like our different political beliefs to whatever degree
00:55:37 Uh, I feel like a lot of people would probably think that I'd just be like with these people
00:55:41 But like I swear to god guys when I hear these things when I hear like michelle for example, this is just sucking my own dick right now
00:55:48 It's like when I hear michelle like laughing at ben. I really do say
00:55:52 Like well, I mean it's pretty clear ben's talking about the economic policy and like it's pretty you know
00:55:58 I'm not talking about the other shit
00:56:01 Yeah, I like that he he put a he put a 100. Well, he proposed a 100 percent
00:56:07 Good gracious a 100 percent like wealth, uh, like wealth like tax bracket above $25,000
00:56:14 Which was about 400 to 500
00:56:17 You know
00:56:18 Well, it was about $500 in in the period time of the period a great quote
00:56:23 I heard recently recently sam harris was getting some pushback for like having different
00:56:27 um, I mean people are getting mad at him for having like different opinions on um, like like islamic terror versus like white
00:56:34 Nationals terror and whatever it's a complex. It was a great podcast
00:56:37 I thought was very interesting on his um the making sense podcast people should go listen to it
00:56:41 I think it's very interesting
00:56:42 But like one of the things he said was just like one of the quotes was just like
00:56:46 If someone likes he said like for example
00:56:48 What about the japanese the japanese have a policy of japan is for the japanese
00:56:53 We don't want you know to to intermingle with others and he's like and what about that?
00:56:57 He's like i'm happy to take this point from hitler himself and to debate
00:57:02 The the the merits of this argument because it doesn't matter who they're from and I couldn't agree more that that's the smartest way to operate
00:57:09 Um, so basically natus saying go hitler
00:57:12 He made some good points the autobahn guys
00:57:15 He's really killing it with that autobahn to this day fan fantastic
00:57:19 So there and you know so f dr did some like I don't know I think george washington had some good things
00:57:23 You know columbus day was recently a lot of people have very negative things about columbus
00:57:28 But surely we can say it was a different time that doesn't excuse it
00:57:32 But can't we just celebrate the good things? I discovered in america for europe pretty nice. Okay, like i'm like, you know
00:57:38 I just think uh, you know, we could we could not do the internment camp thing
00:57:43 We could not turn away
00:57:47 We could not turn away people fleeing the holocaust, but we could still do the new deal
00:57:52 We could do the new we could do a new new deal, which I think
00:57:56 We're probably pretty good about now. It helped with the last big depression. We're in another one. Hmm. Hmm. What's to be done?
00:58:04 you know I I
00:58:06 Hashtag I stand with women unlike ben, uh, but but uh, I do think
00:58:12 I I do hate it when people when you're I mean you're trying to make a point about something and people do a lot of what about
00:58:18 Ism and you know these
00:58:20 I don't know. I'm just saying what are you saying?
00:58:23 I'm saying that it's a pet peeve of mine when like well, okay on twitter is a format that's
00:58:29 Nobody's gonna take it seriously
00:58:30 It's a terrible place to have substantive debates and whatnot because it's not face-to-face as far as we anonymized
00:58:35 So I get why a lot of people come out and goof and gaffe and but whatever you take a positive stance on anything
00:58:41 Like just now I made some vaguely positive Christopher Columbus points. Like it was pretty cool. He discovered America
00:58:47 Of course, you can say that like his discovery of America resulted in many many bad things
00:58:52 And affirmative stance is open criticism. There's a video
00:58:56 Yeah, okay. Everyone's everyone's on the the Christopher Columbus hate train. Yes
00:59:02 There's a video I've seen being like, you know
00:59:06 Christopher Columbus didn't really like personally do a lot of the bad stuff that we say like, oh
00:59:12 Wait, I don't know. I mean like knowing better. You're talking about because he's yeah, I think so
00:59:17 I think it's knowing better that guy made a point
00:59:19 I because I happen to see this fairly recently, you know with all this being discussed that like a lot of people accuse him of genocide
00:59:26 But yeah, I mean the fact that uh, when you dig into why that is
00:59:30 A lot of it ties back into the fact that like disease wiped out 90 percent of the Native American population
00:59:37 But they literally didn't even know what disease was like at the time and they could not have intended the genocide
00:59:44 Even if they wanted to they couldn't have because of you know, so like I mean, I'm sure there's many other specific things
00:59:50 You know that um that in defense of columbus video in defense of columbus an exaggerated evil is pretty good
00:59:56 I think it was the first knowing better video I ever saw and it's it's a good one like
01:00:01 He did he did do some pretty shitty stuff, but like absolutely not maybe not as much as everyone
01:00:07 Kind of just says he did I don't know there's there's nuance to all of history, you know
01:00:11 Yeah, I feel like a lot of this falls into my mo of like for example when people get too excited about one piece chapters
01:00:19 I am here to regulate and say you are too excited about these chapters and when people are too critical
01:00:26 of historical figures who could
01:00:28 A lot of this is like I'm in the 20th century the 21st century
01:00:32 Of course, we know x y z things are bad. You're too critical of these historical figures
01:00:37 Well, uh, you know relax on that reaction my my issue with the whole thing of like everyone stay in your lane
01:00:43 Calm down the issue I feel with people judging historical figures
01:00:47 So harshly is that like we're all doing things that in a hundred years will be morally reprehensible. We just don't know
01:00:52 I'm not
01:00:55 I'm on the right side of history
01:00:58 Oh, we just don't know like like society culture is going to change and like the standards are going to evolve
01:01:02 And we're all going to do things that are like backwards and stupid at that point
01:01:05 It's not like we've reached the end point of moral progression
01:01:08 So the cast stone backwards is to also inculcate all of us as being terrible people as well
01:01:15 And for all time it's very simple
01:01:17 It's it's very easy and I like it's very easy to say that yes to some degree
01:01:21 Christopher columbus engaged in the slave trade to some degree that seems to be true
01:01:27 He's just a little bit of a slaver, but you know what it was exactly the thing
01:01:32 Okay, then does that mean everything he did because of that is forever bad and forever tainted
01:01:38 No, but nobody nobody says everything was bad unless you're one of my idiot twitter enemies
01:01:46 Says like no, didn't you know f dr was actually a fascist?
01:01:50 I just want people to be consistent as long as you agree. Yes f dr did bad things, but let's focus on the good
01:01:56 You know his economic policy winning world war two or whatever it was he did all good stuff
01:02:01 Same with columbus same with washington ending the great depression
01:02:05 Pretty good. Pretty good stuff winning world war two
01:02:09 But you know on the other hand I feel like I'm being a bit of a nanny and people like michelle would be out here
01:02:15 Bunking me on the noggin and saying nate. I'm just trying to mean bro. I'm just trying to mean
01:02:21 Michelle doesn't think
01:02:25 Michelle I'm speaking directly to you. Oh, you don't think that jokes mean anything
01:02:30 But they do and they're funny because they mean something they have real victims
01:02:35 They have real victims and you're talking to michelle thinks that if you're making a joke
01:02:40 Nothing you say has to mean anything, but if that were true, you wouldn't laugh
01:02:44 You wouldn't laugh would you think about it? Damn
01:02:48 Damn damn debunked for all time. I'd say
01:02:53 Say hello to the tolerant laugh once again ladies
01:02:57 They're back and they're better than ever
01:02:59 Do we want to go to voicemails? I think we should go to voicemails. How many fucking voicemails do we have?
01:03:04 So, okay, there's there's 11 slash 12 because one's a two-parter
01:03:10 We you know, we might not need to play that two-parter
01:03:12 You I'll let you decide when we get there because it may or may not warrant it
01:03:16 But all right, you get it started. Let's let's roll first up started in here tails of a virgin
01:03:21 Oh, of course, everyone speak pipe link down below leave us a voicemail. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you very much
01:03:27 Okay tails of a virgin. Let's go on the count of three. All right. You guys you guys ready? Yeah
01:03:31 Okay the count of three one two three
01:03:34 I don't think I've ever been terribly interested in sex or dating. I'm a little bit too autistic
01:03:40 for all that. So I'm still a virgin
01:03:42 but
01:03:44 But I once got very very close to popping that cherry
01:03:48 A friend of my mom was injured in an accident involving some fuckface
01:03:53 So she was helping develop on her gas line or some shit
01:03:56 So she was out of commission for a while and I went there. I lived there for about a month helping her
01:04:03 Taking care of her her dogs like where this is guy, you know, just no being there
01:04:10 And after the first three weeks, I think on the third weekend of me being there
01:04:15 her sister ends up coming down and
01:04:19 I mean at this point, I I know everyone pretty well
01:04:22 I'm decent friends with everyone and she tells me her sister now the lady who got injured her sister
01:04:28 Told me hey, I used to be a porn star. So we started to talk about that. I'm like that's that's actually really interesting like
01:04:34 How does that work?
01:04:36 And she you know kind of understanding that I'm an autistic little boy who's fucking homeschool all of his life was like, hey
01:04:43 want to fuck
01:04:45 and I said
01:04:47 no
01:04:49 The reason
01:04:50 She's 50 fucking six or some shit. Yeah gross
01:04:56 Yeah, okay
01:04:58 That's a while ago. That's a porn star from the 70s or so. Yeah
01:05:01 a little bit little later, you know, I mean
01:05:04 I
01:05:05 Cool story bro, but unironically cool story
01:05:09 Kind of a cool story that I enjoyed hearing
01:05:13 Imagine that good for you
01:05:16 Uh, how unfortunate maybe one day you'll find a porn star who's not
01:05:20 50 something when you are
01:05:22 When I feel like a lot of people perhaps a lot of virgins out there listening to this or maybe not
01:05:26 Would be like whoa, bro for girls said I want to fuck. You know, I do it instantly
01:05:31 I mean unironically if you're a virgin and a girl just comes up and says let's fuck
01:05:35 You don't know what you're doing and it's like embarrassing and like I would I absolutely would have done the same thing
01:05:41 I've been too scared to do anything. Yeah, I don't I just don't blame you. I don't know about any all any all that
01:05:47 I don't know about any all that
01:05:50 But I do love these stories from virgins that are like bro. I was so close to losing by virgini
01:05:56 Now granted this one's a little bit more real than a lot of those unless you're making it up
01:06:00 I mean, I can't prove he isn't but a lot of dude this girl. She was giving me the look
01:06:04 I totally could have smashed bro. Yeah, totally could have smashed
01:06:06 I just chose not to because I love god and I love jesus and I didn't want to come between the two of us
01:06:12 That's uh, that's the story I can get into
01:06:16 Fuck yeah, dude now that's that's what gets me excited. It's thinking about being married to god. Let's go to the next one
01:06:23 Speaking of god, uh, next one is from oh voicemail god is real once and for all
01:06:29 Let me just uh, okay. I'm ready. Yeah, you got it. Okay on the count of three. Here we go one two three voicemail god here guys
01:06:37 Apparently I need to prove my existence
01:06:41 So I'm here to take credit for the five voicemails that were mine that were played on episode 180
01:06:47 number one
01:06:49 Sound like the morning somewhere
01:06:52 Pick a number guy
01:06:53 PCP shadow puppet master guy professional nate trigger
01:06:57 And some of my other characters
01:07:00 Such as pcp professional bit ruiners pcp promise guy
01:07:05 Uh retarded ben head yang ganger guy
01:07:08 And yeah, I mean I I'm real god is real. I'm a natehead. I don't remember any of this
01:07:13 So I think I'm above everyone so that makes me god
01:07:17 He's a natehead and a benhead the universe motherfuckers impossible. You that almost proves his divinity because you can't be a benhead and a natehead
01:07:27 Well, he's like the alpha and the omega like you'd have to that's totally contradictory
01:07:31 Everything everything I believe is everything you hate and vice versa
01:07:36 That that's definitely true. So I don't quite understand. Um, I'll just have to take his word
01:07:41 He was on five voicemails. Okay, apparently again, I'm kind of just taking his works
01:07:45 I'm not going to go fucking unless unless the people who left those other voicemails call in and challenge his class
01:07:50 Yeah, uh, uh voicemail antichrist. Please call in and prove that he's lying and he's exaggerating. Um, you know
01:07:56 Do do something about that. Is he on the shortlist for uh, voice voice grail
01:08:02 I feel like this guy is going to voice purgatory. Uh, you know to voice hell
01:08:06 Uh, well, maybe not hell, but he's totally neutral if he hasn't gotten into voice
01:08:10 Grail on purpose here
01:08:12 I mean if he's the voicemail god, he's already there, right? Like we don't he's a voice heaven, I guess, right?
01:08:17 He doesn't need our help. Oh god the voice cosmology is so convoluted expanding
01:08:21 I know we need a voice manual of the planes sort of pcp voice lecture. I gotta lay it all out
01:08:28 All right, next one is from marlowe. Are you guys you got it? I'm ready. I gotta get ready
01:08:33 Okay, all right count of three one two three
01:08:35 So I found podcasts this week that also happened to be called the procrastinators podcast
01:08:40 A clear case of copyright infringement as they also use the word podcast in their title
01:08:46 So about them they only have one episode published so far
01:08:50 It's posted five months ago. It's only five minutes. Oh, and worst of all
01:08:54 episode title is referencing and avoiding plagiarism
01:08:58 Here's a sample
01:09:01 Another episode of the procrastinators podcast
01:09:04 Today I'll be going solo because big jay is away. So you're stuck with me for this episode
01:09:10 Then keeps talking for a while
01:09:13 uh-huh
01:09:14 Trust me
01:09:15 Now when you're looking for information for your assignments, it can be hard to find exactly what you're looking for
01:09:21 Using the advanced search tool in the deacon library allows you to pinpoint exactly what you want
01:09:26 Also, if you're looking for a book to borrow you can see if it's in stock at the deacon lock
01:09:30 See you get the point. Well, I'm saying is you guys need to jump on this guy fast before he starts siphoning your patreon box
01:09:37 Tenderly yours
01:09:39 marlowe
01:09:41 Thank you marlowe or maybe we should let him continue to work in
01:09:45 In obscurity because then people who become his fans will find our patreon and pledge thinking we're him
01:09:52 I say we can let him do our work for us
01:09:55 Yeah, we so he's made one episode five months ago with his co-host not present for that particular episode
01:10:02 But I think there's a flourishing community
01:10:03 So we'll only I will demand if he makes further episodes
01:10:06 You have to link our patreon in your description and not have you know your own patreon if we can arrange that I think
01:10:13 I think we can let him stand he can be um
01:10:16 What's the word the the tendrils of the pcp can continue to expand and encompass all
01:10:20 Similar podcasts deal. That's fine. I have to pee
01:10:24 Um, can you play the next one while I take a piss?
01:10:27 But the next one's called tails gets trolled though. I think you want to hear it. Okay. Okay. We'll do the next one
01:10:32 And then he can go piss. Okay. Uh the count of three tails gets trolled one two three. Hey ben. I know uh talks with
01:10:42 having
01:10:43 laserbot on the show
01:10:45 Fell through and that didn't work out
01:10:48 but
01:10:49 I've listened to the tails gets trolled lecture maybe a hundred times and
01:10:54 uh
01:10:56 Every time tom says uh ben like one punch upgrade this or whatever
01:11:03 Uh, I like really want that to happen
01:11:07 So all I'm saying is
01:11:09 Do you have interest in doing that? No, and also I would be willing to back it if you did
01:11:17 End up doing that especially if there was no I got question
01:11:20 I got some sort of a slime comic to make
01:11:22 I'm really sorry. Let's play just much much more filled than it was during
01:11:26 I'm really sorry that that's something you're really interested in and I'm just absolutely not gonna do it
01:11:32 But I'm not gonna waste my fucking life redrawing tails gets trolled when you've already done tails get trolled
01:11:38 If you want to remaster tails gets trolled
01:11:40 Like you just got to go learn source filmmaker download all the models because they're all copyrighted characters that have source
01:11:45 Filmmaker models anyway, just do it yourself
01:11:47 Yeah, that's true. Be the change you want to see it doesn't require artistic vision at this point, you know
01:11:52 But you see I mean this guy at least he's saying I'm willing to financially back
01:11:56 I respect I respect that
01:11:58 But I'm definitely not I'm just I'm just not interested in making that a thing
01:12:03 If this guy can gather thousands and thousands of people
01:12:05 I mean you can surely you can find some artists who's interested in this although
01:12:08 I don't know if laserbot would like legally allow it if that's like allowed. I mean
01:12:13 You would think he would have some combat one online creator at a time. He's currently combating christian
01:12:19 I gotta wait for sport you would think you would think well
01:12:22 I mean I am probably gonna combat ululia at some point because ululia fucking left me in the lurch on the audiobook thing
01:12:29 And I'm ready to unfortunate whenever the whenever this whole thing with chris is over. I think I'm gonna say fuck that guy
01:12:35 I'm gonna take that into my own hands. The elemental masters will face the wrath of slime city
01:12:43 Pretty
01:12:45 All right, go pee go thank god
01:12:47 Get out of here. All right. Well, we'll play the next and all he's gone. Let's do a literally the law
01:12:52 Okay, let's see what that's about one two three
01:12:56 Hello, pcp
01:12:57 This officer Jenkins from the mall and as of right now you are all under arrest for the defamation of humanity via
01:13:03 The existence of this podcast itself anything you say pass this point can and will be used against you in court
01:13:10 Oh, and don't try to be smart getting the paperwork filed out for criminals in a state and abroad took us a while
01:13:16 So by the time you receive this voicemail, we should literally be dunking a donut in your living room
01:13:20 Come out with your hands up and your hands down
01:13:22 We've made special accommodations for each of you. So there's no point in resisting
01:13:26 We traps for the digi bro
01:13:28 Tiger nets for the mage a fake sign pointed toward the bernie poles for the bend a fake sign pointed towards starfleet for the
01:13:34 Nate a trailer ones for the munchie a wheelchair for the tom and a pair of handcuffs
01:13:38 With i'm just being cool written on them for the jesse
01:13:41 Now, I don't know why anyone would be dumb enough to put on those cuffs voluntarily
01:13:45 But that's what the google doc says. So I gotta believe it like the torah
01:13:48 There's another name at the bottom of the page
01:13:50 Davoo
01:13:52 Davo. Yeah, it looks like a time. It happens. Anyways, that's all I had to say. See you fuck is in prison
01:14:00 Well, well, that's it. We're going to jail. There's no escape. You want to guess that's all
01:14:04 Samurai's for me
01:14:05 We're going to this guy
01:14:07 The the the pc police are they've entered our homes and they are in fact here arresting us at this very moment and
01:14:15 Yeah, what can you do about that? Well?
01:14:17 Shelter and three square meals a day is more than I can claim to now. So, you know, perhaps this is an upgrade
01:14:23 Jokes on you. Yeah, we we've been begging for this. We've been hoping for this all along
01:14:28 Uh, all right. Well, there you go. Let's move on to the next one. Yeah, we've got weak willed wagey is calling in
01:14:34 Let's hear uh with this this hero of the common man has to say all right on the count of three ready one
01:14:40 Two three
01:14:41 So I recently become a wage cook and here are the three things that I've learned so far
01:14:45 Number one, you will have no more free time ever
01:14:49 Number two, you will never wear jeans again
01:14:52 You will have a closet full of jeans and other fun fucking t-shirts and clothes
01:14:56 That you will never wear again because you'll only wear them on the weekends
01:14:59 But you're going to be too tired to do anything on the weekends
01:15:02 So fucking all your clothes are trash
01:15:04 uh and number three
01:15:06 um
01:15:07 The shotgun's gonna look pretty tasty
01:15:10 So that's what I've learned being a wage cook so far. Um, how ben and tom how have you guys?
01:15:16 Survived how have you guys managed to not starve to death? I want to learn your ways. Um
01:15:22 Well, I got uh, I got one word for you
01:15:26 patreon.com
01:15:28 St
01:15:31 Yeah, that's literally what's kept me alive. Well, I mean that and youtube ad revenue and twitch donations and you know, whatever
01:15:40 You just got to make yourself a brand
01:15:43 And abuse other people's kindness
01:15:46 Yeah, oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean that's that's a big that's what it's all about
01:15:51 You can't expect to do like the the dream
01:15:53 It's like when you if you look at a guy doing the olympics and you're like, I want to do the olympics
01:15:57 I'm gonna do it today. Well, that's unrealistic
01:15:59 You've got to get a plan going and if you want to be a you know a leech on society
01:16:03 You know internet artist freak show you have to set the stage it takes years to cultivate that
01:16:08 That you know ability so you gotta take years to completely destroy any sense of ethics or morality you have exactly
01:16:16 Well, you see we're all born with a god-given sense of morality and it takes years to dismantle that brick by brick by brick
01:16:22 So you gotta get to work on that immediately
01:16:25 And uh, the it will pay off in the long term. You have to lose everything to gain everything or some
01:16:31 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes something like that. All right next one lecture me dads
01:16:36 Okay, let's see what this individual has to say on the count of three one two three
01:16:40 So i'm a huge pcp head and recently on episode 180
01:16:45 You guys are talking about how you were wondering if anybody discovered the pcp because of ben's christian lecture
01:16:52 And i am definitely one of those people
01:16:54 I think a lot of people came into the pcp because of that like really excellent lecture
01:16:59 Your guys's lectures are the fucking bomb
01:17:02 They get
01:17:03 Way more views than anything else this little club has ever fucking created
01:17:06 It's true. Well in a completely different league like we're talking like digi bro levels of fucking views
01:17:12 Just for these fucking lectures if you guys were smart you would have rad con five or six or whatever fucking rad con rat now
01:17:19 You would have that be the fucking rad con
01:17:22 Conference the rad con seminar where you just do fucking lecture after lecture
01:17:27 I want three lectures from each of you on my desk that's fucking next week
01:17:32 Because that shit would get you guys millions of views
01:17:35 Whatever your lecture would be about that would attract viewers related to that topic who would then be introduced to the pcp
01:17:41 It's it's just fucking algorithmic. It's fucking beautiful. It's long form content. It's the good shit. It's algorithmic
01:17:48 Fucking make the big break. You guys deserve it fucking do lectures. God damn it
01:17:53 Yeah, that aptly stated. Yeah, I mean we've we've kind of talked about that before about how like the lectures are like
01:18:00 Proven content that does work with the way youtube is the problem. I mean
01:18:05 I think the the reason we don't do more of them is just because
01:18:08 Like part of the the whole appeal is you have the the audience, you know, everybody else listening and we're not all
01:18:15 In the same place. Yeah, that's the total there's a there's a lot of prep involved in doing these
01:18:22 Yeah, there's only I do I do wish we had more ready access to do them like
01:18:28 Imagine if we could like it's it's easy to do we just need like the camera man is actually very important in those
01:18:34 So yeah, the camera man and the mic the mic setup setup is like actually crucial
01:18:40 Yeah, I mean we've talked about like one of the things we would do with pcphq would we have a studio that set up to do
01:18:46 You know lectures on a more regular basis and we just hey we're going to the studio and recording one
01:18:51 And uh, it would be easy peasy. Yeah, but the dream of pcphq is dead, so
01:18:57 Unless you give us more money double your patron now. No
01:19:02 No, it's well, maybe it's dead for you ben, but not for me
01:19:05 Okay, if i don't know if pcp is like two of us live in the same place, then okay
01:19:10 I don't I mean, I don't even think that I can just this is the new thing
01:19:13 pcphq doesn't have to be a place of residence if we're rich enough
01:19:16 We can just fly everybody out on the weekly. Oh, I see I see technically speaking. I suppose that's true, but uh, I mean
01:19:25 If we made more money that would change the whole equation a morphous concept that can take whatever form is most convenient for us
01:19:31 I basically I agree. Well, and you put it like that. I'm a little more sympathetic
01:19:35 Okay, okay. Let's go to our next one here. Uh center point x nexus ship thick. Okay. This is the one
01:19:42 Nexus, so let's let's hear what this one is. Okay three. Oh, sorry. One two three nexus
01:19:48 Come on, dude. Chili's on fire your people are rioting and the government is corrupt
01:19:53 Okay, like look if you actually want to get fucking out of chili and and come to america, dude
01:19:58 I I will actually unironically marry you to get you here, man
01:20:02 Come on come on. No sex required. No gayness. Just just straightforward, uh corrupt marriage. Let's go
01:20:10 Yeah, you got to do you got to pull a ross and holly and just have a sham marriage
01:20:14 Like how like ross did to get a fucking american green card or whatever. I swear to god. That's true. I I'm convinced
01:20:21 That's what happened. Yes. That's just it's just my pet theory, but I am convinced
01:20:27 That is fascinating. I mean just the timeline all line up for that stuff
01:20:30 Well, the reason I think that is because holly talked about jared being like the first person to like stir feelings in her
01:20:37 That like made her think like maybe i'm not asexual like I thought
01:20:41 Implying that she was asexual while she was with ross
01:20:44 So, well, you know, we do know asexual people who are in relationships despite that and I wonder if
01:20:51 You know, I wonder if yeah, but it'd be really a sexual person obviously, but whatever. I mean, obviously doesn't exist
01:20:56 We all know that but so, you know, well, okay
01:20:58 So if you're not fucking then the question is why and it's just like well ross is an australian
01:21:03 But I'm I think he obviously wanted to move to america because he did and a marriage with holly sure would be convenient for that
01:21:11 And you know their breakup sure was drama free, you know, so I think probably they just fucking did it for the green card like why not
01:21:20 You know, I mean they probably liked each other fine, you know
01:21:23 Um, I just think that there's I mean this this discovery of feelings or whatever
01:21:28 I mean that that's all cool and all that. Oh my god imagine not to be mean but like imagine pro jared
01:21:33 I know awakens your sexuality
01:21:36 Jesus christ. Well, it's because the guy wasn't because it happened. It's because it happened through it wasn't holly and jared
01:21:42 It was deith and strict snate
01:21:44 That's why I have to give the deith and strict's lecture
01:21:47 Her oc is not asexual you see and that's why it was able to happen and you know
01:21:53 Damn fast. There's so much so many layers to this story. I swear. That is interesting. That is interesting. Okay. Well, anyway, it is and I
01:22:00 Was just thinking about this yesterday
01:22:02 Well, that's actually a pretty funny story. Maybe I should tell it
01:22:06 Uh, yeah, it's details like that that make I don't know like all these stories like the lectures and whatever
01:22:11 Makes them interesting like digi's background. No lore about the dick stuff and my kingdom hearts. I don't know whatever anyway
01:22:18 All right next time. Let's go pc purgatory application
01:22:22 Uh, all right, let's see what's up with that on the count of three one two three
01:22:28 Oh, fuck. I'm sorry. I just forgot to start mine. I was I was totally spaced out
01:22:33 Oh, but you know what I forgot to say, okay
01:22:35 Everybody gets one and I was gonna say by the way nexus getting contact with center point in some way
01:22:39 He says he'll do it. Let's get you out of chile, buddy. Let's uh, it sounds pretty rough over there
01:22:43 Let's call his bluff. Okay. I'm ready and by the way, I don't understand
01:22:46 You know what? Okay, never mind the whole marriage for just weird purposes thing
01:22:50 Like what what is the actual like legal reason you're supposed to get married? Like do you have to like love?
01:22:56 I swear to god
01:22:57 I swear to god like part of me wants to just like like go on craigslist and just find someone
01:23:04 Okay, I told someone some of this and they were like you technically have to co-habitate. It's like, oh, well that's uh
01:23:10 Like I should literally just marry one of my roommates like just for the tax break
01:23:13 Like I would do it because I don't give a fuck
01:23:16 Because like who cares I just I'm just
01:23:18 If it would save me money, fuck it
01:23:21 Once we accepted that like I mean a gay marriage or whatever. It's fine. I don't care
01:23:25 It's just like, okay
01:23:26 That's obviously not for the traditional breeding practices that presumably marriage was for once we said like that's normal and fine
01:23:33 It seems to me. I'm not trying to make like a slippery slope disrespectful argument. I'm just saying we're now we're just saying it's like for basically
01:23:40 Any purpose we want which is fine. I don't care. So
01:23:44 Doors open. Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure anything involving getting it getting a break from the government
01:23:49 Well, there'll be extra scrutiny involved just because the government totally sucks
01:23:54 I just don't understand like what the standard is though
01:23:56 Like what is a legitimate marriage as opposed to an illegitimate one now. You gotta love each other. I don't I don't know
01:24:03 It seems like the the the condition is cohabitation
01:24:07 Oh, I guess that's fair. But I
01:24:09 I just aren't you already cohabitating with like five other people
01:24:12 Yeah, exactly. I should literally just fucking gay marry one of my roommates and
01:24:17 Why not not give a fuck?
01:24:19 Yeah, all right. Anyway, let's go to uh next one. Oh, right. We okay. This is a PC purgatory application
01:24:25 All right on the count of three one two three slaps
01:24:29 Relyaminated resume on table
01:24:32 What's up PCP? I'm here to apply for the new job known as the head of the PC purgatory
01:24:39 And my qualifications are simply this
01:24:43 For the past by the time you're listening to this
01:24:46 15 episodes, I've had one to three voicemails about her episode
01:24:52 And well, that's why I think I should be the head of the PC purgatory
01:24:58 And because none of my voicemails have either been grailed or jailed. So let me know what you think. Thanks
01:25:06 That is quite a distinction to be on that. Is this the same guy as the proving being god?
01:25:12 I believe that it is. I believe that it is. Okay, like I can't so
01:25:18 I I mean this guy obviously leaves a lot of fucking voicemails as we're hearing
01:25:22 This guy obviously leaves a lot to be desired
01:25:27 We know who blew through our fucking storage and got got us that warning from speak pipe now
01:25:32 Oh, yeah, it's your fault you fucking clod by the bio. You know what a small update on the speak pipe
01:25:38 We still have that message up top saying like you have full user account, but they're still going in
01:25:44 I mean, do I need to clear it out? I'm kind of want to see how far we can push this before it
01:25:49 You know here's my proposal mate. I feel like we wait. We see how it goes and if we do end up getting charged
01:25:55 I think we make this guy head of PC purgatory and his job is to pay that fee
01:26:00 Haha, ooh, I like this plan. This is a good plan. Although at any time we could just delete all the old voicemails
01:26:06 That might take a while, but uh, it'd be really funny. It'd be really funny
01:26:10 Um, good thing we have somebody in charge of the PC purgatory to do that task for us. Thank god for that
01:26:16 All right, I'm first voicemail
01:26:19 I'm all for I'm all for outsourcing that shit. Um, all right. Here we go. Next one is Linus lucky
01:26:24 All right, and let's play on the count of three one two three
01:26:28 Hey, I got a question for all the art boys in the pcb. How do you guys feel about people drawing glued fan art of your characters?
01:26:34 Like I know ben said he's really touched and honored when somebody takes the time to draw a character that he made
01:26:40 But would that change if they made like
01:26:42 Vince with a giant slong porpoise into his roommate? I forgot a name. I'm sorry
01:26:46 Also, I would like to use the zoomie as a flesh like goodbye
01:26:55 No, uh, I would feel I mean, I wouldn't be like mad
01:27:00 I wouldn't really like it just disappointed. I would just be kind of like
01:27:05 Yeah, I'd still be flatter that someone was drawing them, but I'd be kind of icked out
01:27:11 What if he's totally realistic? I mean like having vinston like an or an orgy or whatever, uh, uh, I mean that's possibly unrealistic
01:27:18 Oh, like like if it was like true to the character or something
01:27:21 Yeah, what if he was just jacking off alone in his room as I'm sure he does, uh, you know, yeah
01:27:27 That would be I mean, that's better. Obviously still still I just don't I just don't want to see that but like whatever right
01:27:35 My standards are way lower any any fan art you want to do is fine in my book
01:27:39 If that's that's how you want to make it happen then go for it
01:27:43 Yes, spread the word spread the word you retweet explicit flesh light usage is zoomie porn
01:27:49 If it's tasteful if it's tasteful
01:27:53 That sounds like a definition of tasteful
01:27:55 Well, you never know
01:27:57 Never know who you're dealing with but uh, that's yeah
01:28:00 If if twitter still had moments, I'd make a whole nsfw fan art moment and I'd put them all in there
01:28:05 So people could browse them. Okay. I would not I would not I would not retweet nsfw
01:28:11 Fan art, but I it's not that I not because I don't appreciate it
01:28:15 It's because it's not my brand anyway. My twitter is not a place for the
01:28:19 It's always it's always interesting when I see
01:28:21 Accounts I follow that are like seemingly not doing porn, but then they just retweets porn out of nowhere
01:28:27 And I'm like, I mean, that's fine. I'm not offended. Just wasn't expecting it. Yeah. Um, yeah. All right. Anyway
01:28:32 Oh, wait, there was something I was going to say about this. I can't remember what it is. So maybe I'll remember later
01:28:38 Okay, whatever. Let's move on for our last voicemail. Uh now this one. Okay. Here we go. This is
01:28:42 119
01:28:44 Which I believe is the number we selected last week as our, you know, we were asked to select a number
01:28:50 We memed him with pi and now we've chosen hard the number 119. Okay. All right
01:28:55 Because it was 119 backwards. Cool. So, uh, so let's hear what he has to say on the count of three
01:29:00 Finally one at long last the saga will conclude. Okay. One two three
01:29:06 119
01:29:07 Pretty good number. I was rooting for 144
01:29:11 But for the purpose of my bid, it doesn't really matter too much
01:29:14 But I still like 119 as well. So thanks for suggesting that
01:29:19 Anyways, this is where the bit was going
01:29:22 I'm about to drop some truth bombs
01:29:25 All right, the war on normal people page 119
01:29:31 Compounding the problem is that Americans now move across state lines and change jobs at
01:29:37 lower rates than at any point in the last several decades. Oh, no
01:29:41 The annual rate of interstate relocation dropped from about
01:29:45 5
01:29:47 70 to about
01:29:49 1.6 percent, you know what I'm bored. I'm bored. Let's just end it. Let's just end it. I'm done
01:29:54 You know, you know, I got the bit Munchie gave me. Yeah. Good. Good job. Good job
01:29:59 You mean us into playing three whole voicemails for you unless you're unless your voicemail god in which case it's like a hundred
01:30:06 He concluded it by the way, this in case you don't realize this is Andrew Yang's book book
01:30:11 Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, I knew that the war on normal people you know, but I don't know about everybody
01:30:16 Munchie gave me his like info and signed me into his um audible account
01:30:22 So I have access to all of his audio books. Um, I listened to um
01:30:27 God in the state by uh, bakunin, um, which was fine
01:30:32 um
01:30:33 and then uh
01:30:36 I started listening to the war on normal people
01:30:39 And you just like I thought uh, I quit it because it was boring because I've heard all the interviews with him
01:30:46 I know
01:30:47 Right. I know everything he has to say his book is just like it's just like a longer version like it's like adam
01:30:54 I wasn't good. I didn't like it
01:30:56 I didn't wasn't learn anything. No, I feel a little bit bad about cutting that
01:30:59 Should we just in the editing let him play the whole thing before we know? Okay. All right. Fuck it. Go read
01:31:05 You know all the arguments, but does everybody else out there know all the all the points?
01:31:09 Yeah, but
01:31:10 Reading I feel like if you want to listen to short form versions of entry yang's points, there's more
01:31:15 Interesting ways of getting it. Okay. All right. I appreciate the bit though. Uh, mysterious stranger
01:31:20 We need like a name for this guy. It's fine. That's his name. Um, I'm just saying with pie
01:31:24 You could have gone 14 percent down page three or whatever. That's exactly what I was gonna say
01:31:29 Why not just start down a couple lines on page three? That's uncreative thinking god voice god
01:31:35 You need to step up your game, sir. You could have made it work
01:31:39 But I forgive you. I I forgive you. I just I just
01:31:42 I just was listening to it and I was like, uh, yeah
01:31:46 Yep, truckers if you listen to a bunch of a lot of american sure do work as truckers
01:31:52 Uh, yeah, automatic cars sure are gonna put them out of business soon
01:31:56 I've heard yawn. I've goes back to accruing capital maliciously and exploitatively
01:32:03 I've heard this before yang yang
01:32:06 How dare he make the same argument? I mean, that's probably why I mean, you know, bernie or whatever
01:32:11 I mean a lot of people are like, yeah, we've heard bernie's point. I mean, it's to his credit
01:32:14 He says the same thing, you know, because he's been consistent his entire political career
01:32:19 Yeah, it's not that it's not that like I've heard this before and it's dumb. It's just yeah, I've heard this before
01:32:25 It's you know, I don't need it. I don't need to hear it again
01:32:28 It's in you know, it's kind of similar to our I don't know at least my youtube content whatever you want like a currently
01:32:33 Like a constantly rolling
01:32:35 Exposure to new people because the old people are very aware of the things you say
01:32:40 So you want it just to access new people
01:32:42 So you want to like repackage your ideas in a way that's satisfying for old folks and like
01:32:47 Engaging and interesting for new people or something. Sure. Yeah, I don't know sure balancing acts
01:32:52 No
01:32:53 Oh, by the way people the reason we were doing that one two three thing
01:32:56 I almost forgot
01:32:57 This is what I was thinking of before that I forgot is because rhythm bot is like broken and not working or something
01:33:01 I don't know why it's doing that. That's why we had to count down weirdly
01:33:04 And we're sick of it. I don't know all shit. It's it we're having issues at issues
01:33:09 Elias are could have just edited out the countdowns and then
01:33:12 No, okay. Well, maybe we'll get to do that, but
01:33:15 It's got to be the real shit dude podcast experience. It's like you're here in my gross room with you, right?
01:33:22 One time on the pizza party podcast and ben is committed to bringing down the quality of our show
01:33:27 Speaking of speaking of legitimate podcast experience like we do very little uh, like cutting and tweaking at least historically we have
01:33:33 So I I feel like that's at least somewhat to our credit that we're able to be engaging in high
01:33:37 That's true for the most part
01:33:39 But I was curious if did you said on his appearance on the on the piece of party podcast years ago
01:33:44 They like heavily edited it and sped it up actually did they do that to yours as well ben? Not that I
01:33:50 Know of I don't think so. Okay, they they they made um
01:33:54 Some very only do it if they think it needs it. I think pan made some very minor like cuts
01:33:59 But like for the most part it's just as as were recorded just upload it as is
01:34:07 Okay, I was and you know actually that reminds me there was another voicemail
01:34:10 I didn't play that was someone saying like ben it's one thing for you to come on the pcp and make your long political points
01:34:17 It's another thing to go on pan pizzas
01:34:20 Podcast and interject your obnoxious unwanted political discourse into their their precious baby
01:34:27 How could you do such a thing? Those fucking cowards wouldn't even agree that we should smash capitalism
01:34:33 Oh, those those those fools those rank amateurs
01:34:37 They wouldn't even they didn't even have anyone in mind that they're voting for in the democratic primaries on it
01:34:43 Like I'm honestly shocked and a little bit embarrassed for them
01:34:47 When is the primary? Is there like time to figure that out? It's like next year, isn't it?
01:34:50 It's it's it's not a good amount of time. It's a way as a way
01:34:53 But you should have a fucking clue at this point. All right
01:34:56 You are overestimating the political engagement of your average cartoon reviewer on youtube
01:35:02 What what do you mean?
01:35:05 No, come on. Uh, don't they know how much sur plus capitals being removed from them? They need they need they need burning more than anyone
01:35:13 They just don't know to pay for their fucking to pay their fucking
01:35:18 Animation school bills like like debt that they went into like because fucking go fund me is not gonna make it for 99% of them
01:35:26 They just need to open up that Kickstarter get that cool 12 grand a year and you know
01:35:31 Engaging I have achieved I have achieved the freedom dividend and I did it and I did it through Kickstarter, baby
01:35:37 Although papers did it for me
01:35:39 I just want to reiterate because I found this fascinating the way that like and I I said this to you in our chat, which was just like
01:35:46 Uh, actually, you know of interest my dad and I assume, you know, I assume your dad as well
01:35:52 Has been like donating. He's been just been giving us like a couple hundred bucks every once in a while
01:35:57 Putting it into like a retirement fund. Oh
01:35:59 Well, he does that he does that for like a um, it's like a holiday like a christmas and birthdays
01:36:04 He'll put like a deposit is like a gift
01:36:06 Yeah, he'll put like a deposit. He'll deposit some money into like a um
01:36:10 Like a like a Roth IRA fund
01:36:13 Basically, but what what I found interesting was for years. He'd been begging me to like Nate. It's in a fund
01:36:18 That's like not making any money. I need you like it's it's in this company that like does investment for you
01:36:22 What you're supposed to do
01:36:24 Fidelity I'm learning all this for the first time. I know I did it. I went like no I didn't because I'm an idiot
01:36:29 No, I finally did I finally did
01:36:32 Take his advice and go and like call the company up and have them put it into a
01:36:37 Um, well, there's a couple the one that they yeah
01:36:41 I had them put it into a thing called fidelity go, which is a like a mutual yeah a mutual fund that's managed by an algorithm
01:36:49 Yeah, so so what it is for those who don't know it's like
01:36:52 I mean, it's it is I assume yours is still a because there's there's like tax reasons like we can't get the money until we retire
01:36:57 It is still an IRA, but it is okay
01:36:59 So so we have like the same thing then I think and it's that you you you put money into it and the people at fidelity
01:37:05 Kindly invest that money for you. And so now technically both of us like own some small stop
01:37:11 I mean, that's what that's what a mutual fund is. That's what it is. I'm learning
01:37:15 I had no idea about any of this shit until just now and so now it's like so I'm finally getting it
01:37:21 I'm like now I actually have a real stake in like the the economy the economy
01:37:27 And if if the market does well those stocks will like increase in value and I will when I retire
01:37:34 Gain money. I mean, that's that's the idea. That's the idea
01:37:37 Theoretically yes
01:37:38 So like up to this point. I kind of didn't understand why like I like people would say like, oh no the market's doing bad
01:37:45 My retirement money. I'm like, don't you like why would that affect your retirement money?
01:37:49 I don't understand but it's because your investments have invested in this shit. Yes
01:37:54 It all it all makes sense to me now
01:37:56 I don't know my best thing just sounds like a way of putting a ball and chain around you and tying you down to this capitalist system
01:38:02 So when ben blows it up everyone's involved
01:38:05 Oh, yeah, I mean draw. I should withdraw my funds before I start my real revolutionary praxis
01:38:11 True, although you'll have you'll lose like taxed some amount it like because it's it's the reason
01:38:16 So this is the interesting thing you like quote-unquote you can't take it out until you retire
01:38:21 But if you do it just gets taxed like I don't know some pretty decent amount
01:38:25 So like 10 or 20 percent or something which can be a lot if it's like your your you know retirement fund or whatever
01:38:31 So you want to just leave it there and let them like that's why it's all making sense to me now now
01:38:37 Because all that money's there. It's supposed to be there until I retire
01:38:40 We you're supposed to pump money into it everyone, you know regularly
01:38:43 So more money is there can be invested the whole market grows
01:38:46 It's like I now have a stake in the economy doing well
01:38:50 That isn't like solely dependent on just the value of the american dollar, which was everything I had up to this point
01:38:56 That's where like all my money was now
01:38:58 it
01:38:59 Now I like the mark if the market grows my investment in the market grows and I'll have more money
01:39:05 So I hope america doesn't crash and all those all those good things. It's funny. I find uh, did you?
01:39:11 Do you just bring this up because you were
01:39:13 interested in talking about
01:39:15 The market and interest rates and stuff
01:39:17 I mean because because now yes because now I finally actually have like
01:39:23 An actual experience of real capitalism like I get it now. I'm in there. I'm doing it
01:39:29 And like I feel the urge to like look at the markets and and and and here's the here's the dark cloud
01:39:34 I'm sort of getting it because right now. What if somebody came to me?
01:39:37 Let's say I was I had like a billion dollars invested and someone was like, oh, hey, Nate
01:39:42 Did you know like these big companies that perhaps you have lots of like stock in they're actually like
01:39:48 Exploiting their workers and they're like doing bad things and they're you know, I don't know polluting the environment
01:39:54 And they're like, Nate, we should like tell people
01:39:56 I want you to do it for some reason and I'm like, oh, but I have a lot of stock invested in them
01:40:01 So I think I'm just gonna like not tell the world about these horrible things these companies doing so I can personally profit
01:40:07 From their growth and I'm like, I'm starting to see the picture. I'm starting to get it
01:40:13 You should sell your stock immediately because someone else will do it and then
01:40:17 You can like get fucked. That's what I would do. Um, well, yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm going to keep doing it
01:40:22 I mean, it's first of all, it's not that much money and I find it interesting
01:40:25 But like I'm I'm getting why these things can be bad and how bad negative things can happen as a result
01:40:30 you you're
01:40:32 Are you saying that you are
01:40:35 Understanding why a purely profit-motivated system might have downsides. That's correct, Ben. That's correct
01:40:44 Now you'll stand by it seems like a pretty good system for for helping out the world
01:40:49 And I think it comes down to us as individuals to police these people if they're doing good or bad things
01:40:54 But I can see I'm just saying I can see I see why corruption could be rampant in the system and uh
01:41:01 Could be a new perspective now that I've got experience. Yeah, I don't know might it might theoretically run rampant
01:41:08 It might perhaps it's possible. Yeah, everyone wants a word with you
01:41:14 Um, I should relook at those things with my newfound understanding of of these of these things. Um and ron good boys
01:41:20 It's uh, you know, it was kind of a hassle
01:41:22 But uh, it was a pretty good. It was a pretty good fucking gift for dad to do to set up a fucking IRA
01:41:28 I'm sure I'll appreciate it
01:41:30 Sure, I'll appreciate that in the future. Like I could theoretically have done it myself, but I certainly wasn't going to
01:41:36 Well, you know, the other thing was while I was doing this
01:41:39 I opened up another like a non-retirement account that's basically just like investing in the market
01:41:44 And I'm thinking about just like putting some money in there of my own
01:41:46 I should keep my like like I keep my fucking money in a checking account and like I need to not do that
01:41:52 Yeah, my money's been in a checking account as well and it is retarded
01:41:56 It is stupid and I'm just losing out like every time I go to my bank. They're like, do you want to open a savings account? I'm like, uh,
01:42:03 that's
01:42:04 Work by
01:42:05 Yeah, it's just the worst idea financially uneducated as a populace and these things are so important. They keep us under their capitalist thumb
01:42:13 Well, we luckily we have the internet. They can't repress our uprising now as us. We've become ethical responsible investors and owners of capital
01:42:22 That's what we need to do as a populace
01:42:24 And uh, I'm a I'm a work on it seize the means of investment
01:42:28 Exactly. There you go. Um, so there I thought that was an interesting story. Um, I think this is cool
01:42:33 I'll let you know how it goes boys. I'm keeping an eye on the market. I'm invested in the outcome
01:42:41 That's why they call it that
01:42:43 I got the fidelity app on my phone now. So like I I'm thinking really you're so you're that into it
01:42:49 Well, I mean, let's not exaggerate here. I I downloaded the app
01:42:52 I checked it like once when I first got it. So like I'm not like
01:42:55 I mean, I this we're like there was an episode of Seinfeld where Seinfeld invests like $5,000 in the market
01:43:00 I called them up. I had them put it into fidelity go and then I was like in like six months
01:43:05 I'll call back and ask like how it's going and if it's like if I've lost all my money. I'll be like, fuck you
01:43:12 Uninvest now
01:43:14 I see that's the great thing by dad just giving us this money in this in this fund
01:43:17 Like I didn't have to like weigh like I wanted to invest this money
01:43:21 Do I this is not like this is not like a bunch of free money trust fund
01:43:24 This is like a collective amount that has been built up over like years and years of like him putting small amounts in
01:43:29 For like Christmas and birthdays and stuff. Very true. This is not like, oh, you just set us up with a fucking trust fund or whatever
01:43:36 Indeed indeed, although I suspect we will inherit a good amount of money
01:43:40 When they kick the bucket, but we'll see we'll see how that goes one day ladies. Um
01:43:45 I mean, maybe I mean they own I mean they own a house never know firsthand
01:43:50 I mean, they do own a house. So I mean, that's that's a considerable
01:43:53 That's a considerable value to be extracted. I mean, I'll just lay it
01:43:57 I mean, I was talking to dad yesterday about this and I I mean dad was we were joking about this and I was just like
01:44:02 Dad, have you ever considered like putting a cap on your lifespans that you don't use up all my money when you're, you know
01:44:07 Decrepit and you know, what do you think about that? And he was like
01:44:11 Generously, he said, Nate, I knew you're half joking about that and uh, only half joking dad only half joking
01:44:18 I mean, this really happened. This really happened. I mean it was in fact a joke
01:44:23 But every joke has a little kernel of truth to it, you know
01:44:26 Yeah, that's what i'm saying. Michelle jokes mean something. You can't just say, oh, that's just a joke. Don't worry about it. No
01:44:33 What's the joke? What does it mean? What's the joke sir? What's the joke sir?
01:44:38 What's the joke sir? That's my new thing
01:44:41 I'm gonna tweet that at trump every day
01:44:44 What's the joke sir? What's so funny sir? Have you no shame sir?
01:44:50 You know, I'll just a final point on it. It seems to me a little bit silly
01:44:53 Oh, you know what? I guess to be fair
01:44:54 I get why people don't like when the president is obviously being an asshole and and joking
01:44:59 But I think it is pretty clear. He is in fact joking and much of this thing
01:45:04 I mean, I guess some of the time is that appropriate. Is that appropriate?
01:45:07 That's debatable. That's debatable. I mean, but when people say it is entertaining and that's what i'm on twitter.com for
01:45:13 I like we just you got to take the argument for what it actually is and if people are like
01:45:17 Trump really did stack those hamburgers a mile high fact-checked not in fact true
01:45:23 Um, you know, which is just being a little silly. Is that a specific reference that I don't know?
01:45:28 At one point
01:45:30 Trump literally said that we stacked hamburgers a mile high and like factcheck.org they did the research turns out debunked
01:45:37 He did not stack those. Do you that would be that would be literally
01:45:42 75 000 hamburger patties, which you know what seems unrealistic frankly on its face
01:45:48 We have no reports of such a stack
01:45:51 Not one eyewitness account, but trust deranged words
01:45:55 so
01:45:57 You know, thank god, we're here to be the fact-checkers. All right, there you go. I see that's I see that's all there is to it
01:46:02 Um, so I I'm glad you're all now voting trump in 2020. It's gonna be a good time. That's right. Can't wait. I'm glad we converted you

01:46:26 PCB minecraft is still under construction. But by the time you hear this, I think it will be back up and running
01:46:32 No, they said it though. I I'm saying it. I'm saying it. We're we're in good shape. I want to do more
01:46:37 I want to get in there. I haven't been in the new server yet
01:46:41 That I really think we're very close to it being finished and it will be back up and running
01:46:45 If I play in this minecraft server, it will be the second time I've ever played minecraft in my life
01:46:51 Well, it's gonna be a great time. I can guarantee that. It's never been a better time to start
01:46:56 It's never been a hotter topic
01:47:00 It's just unironically let me just say unironically the community of people that have come to that minecraft server are hugely active
01:47:07 Even though the server is down
01:47:09 And we've got like 80 people who pledged that's a huge community way bigger than I expected it to be
01:47:14 People seem to really like the couple people that were hanging out in Bufalantopia. Can we yeah, can we please burn down Bufalantopia?
01:47:22 Then we will definitely go back to Bufalantopia. Absolutely
01:47:25 Yeah, okay, can't leave that chapter. I can't I was thinking I was thinking the the next time we stream we should start on Bufalantopia
01:47:33 And like make it our our final visit. I say it every episode, but I
01:47:37 We can't we can't leave it like no
01:47:40 Just like Clyde Cash and Jack Thaddeus. We can't die by their hand
01:47:44 We can't let them kill us by ending the server. We have to be the one to put Bufalantopia down
01:47:50 You know, we should do we should ceremony and then go to the server and start new phalantopia or both or both
01:47:56 On tupia or whatever the fuck we want to go now new phalantopia
01:48:00 Head on down but patron a patreon.com slash pcb minecraft five dollars for your monthly joining and then head on south
01:48:06 Follow the path that's that's well trodden down to cool guy village where all the cool guys are building their houses
01:48:13 But perhaps somewhere else out in the ether. We'll have a new phalantopia. We'll be out there where the new phalantope
01:48:19 Be uh, oh
01:48:22 Yeah, it'll be
01:48:23 Oh, that sounds great, but we should we should go to Bufalantopia
