00:00:00 1, 2, 3, sync.
00:00:05 I feel like that was a big delay on that one. Let's try that again.
00:00:08 1, 2, 3, sync.
00:00:12 One more time.
00:00:14 1, 2, 3, sync.
00:00:18 Alright.
00:00:19 Well, I felt like we were all in time with that. Maybe Ben you're hearing us all later.
00:00:25 Maybe the first time.
00:00:27 No, I think it was okay.
00:00:28 I have an awful syncing method, but it works.
00:00:32 What's that?
00:00:33 Hey Ben, how you doing?
00:00:35 I'm cool.
00:00:38 Hey Gibb, how you doing?
00:00:39 I'm alright. No, wait, we're not going to do the whole thing of it.
00:00:43 Go, keep going, keep going.
00:00:46 Hey Oblivion, how you doing?
00:00:48 I'm doing, ah, oh my god, this month is a fucking clusterfuck. I don't know if I can, I don't want to take up the time to explain everything right now.
00:00:56 Just make a noise.
00:00:58 Hey Tick, how you doing?
00:00:59 I'm doing alright.
00:01:02 No, that's not what he said.
00:01:03 Tom, that was done right before.
00:01:05 Maybe there is a flaw in this method.
00:01:08 You have to be able to recognize your name.
00:01:11 Hey Tom, how you doing a second time?
00:01:14 I'm okay, I can't hear what's going on apparently.
00:01:18 Oh god, I just kind of, and then I just line it up because everyone will be in between.
00:01:23 Your mic sounds pretty rough Tom, are you on like your phone or something?
00:01:30 Does it really sound terrible?
00:01:32 Well I mean it doesn't sound great.
00:01:33 It sounds fine, it sounds okay on my end a little bit longer.
00:01:36 Your microphone's pretty rough Tom, are you recording through a dog or something?
00:01:41 Is that better?
00:01:43 Yes, that is better actually, much better.
00:01:46 You catch.
00:01:47 I knew it.
00:01:49 Alright, so are we ready to start?
00:01:52 I like changing my microphone and now everyone sounds like an alien, that's weird.
00:01:57 Oh really?
00:01:58 Do you have to fix something?
00:02:03 Tom, what?
00:02:05 No!
00:02:07 The microphone ate all of his bandwidth somehow.
00:02:11 Genuinely?
00:02:13 When he said we all sounded like aliens, he was ignoring the actual aliens that were right.
00:02:19 Is that any better now?
00:02:21 Yes.
00:02:22 You sounded okay before, but you also sound good now.
00:02:26 Okay, fine.
00:02:27 Do we sound okay?
00:02:28 You've found not terrifying anymore, so I'll take it.
00:02:33 Should we just use the whole thing and not even cut the pre-syncing part?
00:02:40 I like disasters.
00:02:42 Welcome to the Procrestinatus podcast.
00:02:45 Welcome to the PCP, again.
00:02:49 It's me, Ben St.
00:02:52 Gib is here, Gib and Take.
00:02:54 Hello everybody.
00:02:55 Tom Oliver's here, back in fighting shape.
00:02:59 I would go that far, but I am back.
00:03:03 Okay, we've got a lineup today.
00:03:06 Guesting for the first time is Tessnaker.
00:03:10 Hello.
00:03:12 And returning are our friends of the show, Oblivionfall.
00:03:18 Hello.
00:03:19 And Tectonic Improv.
00:03:21 I think this is a record amount of guests for Oblivionfall, me, Tessnaker and Tom Oliver, all guesting on the PCP.
00:03:28 You're forgetting the infamous Oops, All Guests episode.
00:03:32 We had like 70 guests.
00:03:34 I wasn't there.
00:03:36 We could beat that every day.
00:03:38 We could beat that.
00:03:39 We could beat that if we try.
00:03:41 Do just invite them snakes on.
00:03:44 You'll have like 27,000 guests at that point.
00:03:48 Oh yeah, technically true.
00:03:50 On a technicality.
00:03:52 So we've returned to the olden days of two years ago.
00:03:56 And we've returned to the olden days of too many people on a podcast to understand what is happening.
00:04:03 So I guess, how's everyone doing?
00:04:08 How's life?
00:04:11 Playing bad video game all day.
00:04:13 Actually, it's not bad.
00:04:14 I don't know what it is yet.
00:04:16 I'm figuring that out.
00:04:17 My life is currently an absolute clusterfuck.
00:04:21 You don't want to know.
00:04:22 I know that feel.
00:04:23 Yeah.
00:04:24 I just moved into an apartment.
00:04:28 Congratulations.
00:04:30 I guess unless it sucks.
00:04:32 No, it's a pretty nice one.
00:04:35 Oh, it's considered.
00:04:37 You know, it's, I'm still moving everything in.
00:04:39 I got, I still, I have a fucking, I have a ridiculous record collection.
00:04:44 So it's been a pain in the ass bringing all those over.
00:04:47 I had like a bunch of milk crates, but the milk crates are too small for the records.
00:04:51 I want to fucking blow my brains out, but it'll all get done.
00:04:55 It's all right so far.
00:04:57 And think about it.
00:04:58 When you put that final record up, you'll be able to say to yourself, oh, finally.
00:05:03 Yeah, finally.
00:05:04 Exactly.
00:05:05 Amazing.
00:05:06 Good job.
00:05:07 I've still got.
00:05:08 Gamers Tavern is back on the show.
00:05:11 Is that Gamers Tavern?
00:05:12 I've still got a big stack of boxes in the corner of my room from when I moved in
00:05:16 because I'm not willing to get rid of them.
00:05:18 I know I'll need them soon.
00:05:20 For the winter.
00:05:21 Very soon.
00:05:22 For the yet.
00:05:23 When I'm evicted and I need to live inside something, though, that's what I'm going to use.
00:05:29 Yeah, probably.
00:05:31 Yeah.
00:05:32 When my fucking slumlord decides to evict me for, I don't know, nothing, whatever.
00:05:38 You can never be too careful.
00:05:42 Who's got a video playing in the background?
00:05:48 Do I?
00:05:49 Okay.
00:05:50 No.
00:05:51 I heard something.
00:05:52 I heard someone yelling.
00:05:53 I need to work.
00:05:54 That's another guest.
00:05:55 That's five guests.
00:05:56 I live next to a football stadium.
00:05:58 If it was on today, we could have had.
00:06:00 We could have had triple digits.
00:06:02 Oh my God.
00:06:03 We could have.
00:06:04 We could have live.
00:06:05 Sold the microphone up.
00:06:07 No, it is the Arsenal stadium.
00:06:09 So it would have been booing.
00:06:11 Oh, because, you know, Arsenal hates the PCP famously.
00:06:16 Yeah.
00:06:17 What is Arsenal?
00:06:20 Arsenal is a thing where you store ammunition or guns or weapons.
00:06:26 You know, that's what an Arsenal is.
00:06:28 Thing about Arsenal.
00:06:29 True.
00:06:30 True.
00:06:31 That's kind of why the football team is so controversial, because they just get red-carded when they blow the other team away.
00:06:36 Yeah.
00:06:37 People give them a stern look.
00:06:39 They bring their rifles and muskets and stuff onto the pitch, but they can't really do anything until they start murdering.
00:06:46 Every time that happens here in America, just be like, hmm, thoughts and prayers, and that would just be it.
00:06:50 In America, the controversies are all over teams being named racist stuff.
00:06:54 But in the UK, it's like, ooh, that team's name has guns in it?
00:06:58 We don't like, we don't have guns over here.
00:07:00 Oh no, you do not know about English football fan racism.
00:07:03 They are some of the most inventive racists in the world.
00:07:07 I'm saying, yeah, they keep the racism.
00:07:10 Keep the racism, lose the guns.
00:07:12 That's the United Kingdom, I guess.
00:07:15 I just, okay, this is a weird story to bring up about one of my six, seven uncles.
00:07:22 I have too many of them.
00:07:24 I also have like tons and tons of extended family members, but so I understand.
00:07:30 All right, let's hear it.
00:07:32 When the cricket was on last year, I went downstairs, my uncle was visiting family and it was all just...
00:07:39 And I was just going to get a drink of whiskey.
00:07:42 And my uncle just casually just says, hey, Patrick.
00:07:45 And I was like, yeah, are you a racist?
00:07:47 And he asked it in the most casual tone.
00:07:51 I think I've ever been asked the question.
00:07:53 And what was your answer?
00:07:56 Um, no.
00:07:58 You just said no.
00:08:00 I just said no.
00:08:01 I just said no and bought my whiskey.
00:08:02 And I got upstairs and it wasn't always upstairs.
00:08:04 I realized how absurd that question was given the framing.
00:08:08 Did he ask it like he was hoping you were so he could...
00:08:13 Did your answer satisfy him?
00:08:15 He just went, huh, like it was just a very casually interested...
00:08:21 Weird.
00:08:22 Wow.
00:08:23 And kids these days.
00:08:25 I went back down in my house, how bizarre.
00:08:29 I went back down and I had to ask, I just asked, why'd you ask if I was a racist?
00:08:34 And he just said, he just kind of looked at the telly because we were playing.
00:08:37 It was either Pakistan or India.
00:08:40 And he said, well, you know, when the sport's on,
00:08:44 they're saying about us as well.
00:08:47 He was just checking to see if he could say something racist.
00:08:50 I was about to dunk on them, but I'm sure I have the all clear.
00:08:54 Is that what it was?
00:08:56 He wanted...
00:08:57 I don't think that's...
00:08:58 I don't know if that's what it was because he's not...
00:09:00 Of my uncles, he's one of the...
00:09:02 He's one of the less racist.
00:09:04 There's a scale, as they call him.
00:09:06 He's challenging you.
00:09:08 There's my uncle that's like the elder racist, even though he's not the oldest brother.
00:09:12 And then there's, you know, it goes downscale until one is maybe just a little bit of a little Englander.
00:09:18 And...
00:09:20 Well, that was nice of him to ask for consent to be racist before...
00:09:24 I suppose so.
00:09:25 I suppose so.
00:09:26 I'm sure it's okay.
00:09:28 It's better than the conversation I had with another uncle where I've left a passport in a caravan,
00:09:33 which we used to go on holiday and he just said,
00:09:35 you'll want to get that back, you know, then foreigners.
00:09:38 And she's like, I'm just...
00:09:39 I literally just said, I'm walking away from the phone, mate.
00:09:42 I can't be bothered.
00:09:44 It really is.
00:09:46 Especially in sports in the UK, there's just sort of like a...
00:09:50 It's okay to call players of color a racial slur,
00:09:56 but that's just banter.
00:09:57 That's just, you know, lads having fun.
00:09:59 It's just lads having fun.
00:10:01 They just have no understanding.
00:10:03 If they didn't want that, they shouldn't have played for the other guy.
00:10:07 That's pretty much it.
00:10:09 The fun I had with my family...
00:10:11 My family are all big football fans, and it's not even...
00:10:14 It's not just exactly the racism, because my immediate family is just the extended family,
00:10:19 which I find very fucking lucky.
00:10:21 Everybody's got those racist uncles.
00:10:24 Yeah.
00:10:25 But it's funny that every time, you know, penalty on one side,
00:10:29 and my family's just blowing their lids,
00:10:32 and then penalty on the other side, and it's like, no, that was...
00:10:35 That come on with it.
00:10:36 And it's like...
00:10:37 I don't know.
00:10:38 The legitimacy of a penalty is decided on which team it is.
00:10:42 Not by how broken the man's leg is.
00:10:45 That sounds about right.
00:10:46 Yeah.
00:10:47 I watched some good old fashioned American gridiron football
00:10:53 over Thanksgiving the other week.
00:10:56 Go Pats.
00:10:57 Nothing...
00:10:58 It was...
00:10:59 Who was it?
00:11:00 It was the Raiders versus...
00:11:01 The Bills.
00:11:02 The Pats were not playing that day.
00:11:04 Yeah, there might have been the Bills.
00:11:06 Yeah, I think so.
00:11:07 Oh, that was a good game.
00:11:09 That one was like...
00:11:10 That one like went into like overtime.
00:11:12 It was like...
00:11:13 That was actually a great game.
00:11:14 It was really tense, and then the Raiders like barely eked it out,
00:11:18 and we were rooting for them.
00:11:19 So...
00:11:20 Yeah, fuck the Bills.
00:11:22 They're not a sports guy or anything, but I've said before,
00:11:26 I will partake if it's on, and if the season is right,
00:11:31 and the season was right, and a good time was had by all.
00:11:36 Good, good...
00:11:38 Really, really neck and neck.
00:11:40 Real nail biter.
00:11:41 It doesn't get much better than that.
00:11:45 I haven't actually...
00:11:46 It's funny because when I go to America, I do really want to catch
00:11:50 like a baseball game.
00:11:51 If I ever visit America, I'm more like a...
00:11:54 I don't know.
00:11:56 The Simpsons has taught me that it is mostly an excuse to drink,
00:12:00 and it actually is really boring.
00:12:02 I mean, the excuse to drink is fine by me.
00:12:06 I just want to feel like an American for an afternoon or an evening.
00:12:11 I'd go with someone who was excited to go to a game.
00:12:15 Oh yeah, I wouldn't go by myself.
00:12:17 I'd need the company.
00:12:19 That's not me.
00:12:21 I went to a baseball game or two when I was a kid,
00:12:25 and then I've never been to a football game,
00:12:29 but I did work as a beer hawker at a stadium very briefly.
00:12:34 I was really bad at it.
00:12:37 So I've seen a football game or two that way,
00:12:40 but I wasn't paying attention.
00:12:42 I don't know.
00:12:44 Getting a ticket and going and spending the whole day
00:12:48 and getting in the seats and waiting in lines and driving,
00:12:51 it's like too much effort for my blood.
00:12:56 Yeah.
00:12:58 I think it's like I just kind of want to get in on that experience at least once.
00:13:03 Yeah.
00:13:05 I think of that one out for myself.
00:13:07 Great Iron Football is a better sport.
00:13:09 Great Iron Football is a better sport than baseball, though.
00:13:11 I like the experience merely of being in a gigantic crowd of people yelling,
00:13:16 which I can get by going to like a music concert,
00:13:19 so I usually prefer those.
00:13:22 But now, COVID, you could never ever do that ever again.
00:13:26 I don't like concerts either.
00:13:28 I was packing in my bag.
00:13:30 No, concerts aren't for me.
00:13:32 I've got shitty whacked hearing,
00:13:35 so I don't want to risk that any further than I already pushed it.
00:13:40 I hurt my hearing really bad once at a concert.
00:13:43 Thankfully, the ringing went away,
00:13:45 but I never go to a concert without...
00:13:49 Your plugs?
00:13:50 Your plugs.
00:13:51 Yeah, smart boy.
00:13:54 I usually just stick my fingers in my ears if it gets too loud,
00:13:57 but it really doesn't most of the time.
00:13:59 I think I like...
00:14:01 Well, when I get like tickets, I try to get cheap ones,
00:14:05 and they're usually near the back, but of course it's loud,
00:14:08 so it doesn't really matter too much.
00:14:10 If you want to get close,
00:14:12 you're just going to be able to see the people's faces a bit better.
00:14:15 I don't know.
00:14:17 I saw Snacky Puppy once. That was fucking cool.
00:14:20 Oh, I did see...
00:14:22 I did see Zen Huxtable play in a band in a show one time.
00:14:29 This was like a few months ago.
00:14:32 I saw his band, and they were actually really good.
00:14:34 That was a concert that I actually did enjoy quite a bit.
00:14:37 They were playing at some kind of weekly festival
00:14:44 or a little tent set up with a beer stand.
00:14:46 It was like every week this tent place would set up.
00:14:49 They would sell beer.
00:14:51 You could hang out during the day for a block party,
00:14:53 and then they would have a lineup of local bands at night.
00:14:56 And they were the headliner.
00:14:58 Wow.
00:14:59 Apparently he had been conscripted
00:15:03 as a temporary assistant to...
00:15:08 Because they needed more people to perform more tracks on stage with them.
00:15:13 He wasn't an official member of the band,
00:15:16 but I think he got promoted to an official member later,
00:15:20 because he was really good on the keyboard.
00:15:22 That's the plot of that thing you do that Tom Hanks made.
00:15:26 Is it?
00:15:27 The drummer breaks his arm or something,
00:15:31 and the main character fills in form and pretty much takes his spot.
00:15:35 Sorry, movie.
00:15:36 They were...
00:15:39 I don't know.
00:15:42 Anyway, it was a great show.
00:15:44 A lot of fun.
00:15:45 Small crowd.
00:15:47 I think that was better.
00:15:48 And it outdoors probably makes it easier on the ears too.
00:15:52 It's the indoor venues you gotta really be careful about.
00:15:55 True.
00:15:56 It was at... Have you ever been to the Paradise Rock Club, Ben?
00:15:59 That's where I hurt my ears.
00:16:01 I don't think...
00:16:02 It's somewhere in Boston.
00:16:04 It's near the Raising Canes.
00:16:09 No, I've never been.
00:16:11 Damn, man.
00:16:12 I feel like a small cramped room would be...
00:16:16 Not a small, tiny, but a reasonably sized,
00:16:19 but still very much enclosed space would be much worse than stadiums concerts,
00:16:25 which are much louder, but they're usually open on the top.
00:16:29 Those are nice.
00:16:33 Music.
00:16:34 Music.
00:16:35 What was that band you saw again?
00:16:37 What a concept.
00:16:39 Where are we going with it?
00:16:41 What's the apex?
00:16:43 That band that you were talking about, Gib.
00:16:47 What's the point?
00:16:49 Snarky Puppy.
00:16:51 They're like a jazz fusion band.
00:16:56 They've got some really popular songs on YouTube.
00:17:01 Lingus is one where it's got this...
00:17:04 Oh, you linked Cory Henry.
00:17:06 Maybe his guy is once before.
00:17:08 Yeah, they're really proficient jazz,
00:17:12 like a super big group of bunch of people who go to jazz music,
00:17:17 and no singing, it's just music.
00:17:19 It's just real music.
00:17:20 No singing.
00:17:21 Singing's not real music.
00:17:23 It's painted by the human voice, which I agree with.
00:17:26 When I hear...
00:17:27 I got my headphones in and I'm jamming and I'm hearing the beep, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
00:17:33 And then I hear a little...
00:17:35 And then I hear a little...
00:17:36 And then someone goes...
00:17:39 And then someone goes...
00:17:40 And I go, no.
00:17:41 No, and I throw my headphones on the ground and I'm like, they ruined it.
00:17:44 It was pure.
00:17:45 It was pure, and now it's tainted.
00:17:47 It's not like singing. It's just that like when music can fill a stadium
00:17:53 With no like big-name artist singer, you know, it's it's because the music is incredible and it was
00:18:01 Sure, sure. It's an hour eight fair. That's how you know. It's serious real music
00:18:06 Real music not a track under five minutes two drummers. They had like three fucking
00:18:12 brass section
00:18:14 If the lyrics and everyone had a song, then it's real music. That's true. Yeah, lyrics
00:18:20 That's when you uh, that's the only time they're valid, right?
00:18:23 Yes, during the final boss during the final boss when the when like the the opening theme song of the game
00:18:31 Plays, but they add a vocal track
00:18:34 Operatic music. This is the one time humans are allowed to sing
00:18:38 Feel the sunshine
00:18:43 Yeah, I think that's the first song ever sung by a caveman as they like beat something to death with a stick
00:18:50 Caveman was mass destruction from persona free. Yeah, we haven't stopped since
00:19:00 Did you say lotus juice? Oh god, he doesn't know
00:19:04 Is that not the name lotus is is the name of the of the artist who wraps the the songs in persona three
00:19:14 That's his like a stage name. Oh
00:19:18 Yeah, no, I did not know that I thought it was I thought it was like a colloquial British expression or something
00:19:23 Like man, that was so that we needed we needed some lotus juice to get that done like that took some real elbow grease
00:19:30 That took some serious birds milk. That took some real lotus juice
00:19:33 Yeah, we came up with a term lotus juice when we were just absolutely
00:19:39 Defiling China with opium. I don't know if I I mean, you know lotus eaters right from the Odyssey
00:19:45 I don't know it could mean something it could go a bunch of different ways. I'm just do it
00:19:49 I'm just doing free association here. I'm like, you know, it's like John Cleese said you guys are all in the active mode
00:19:55 You guys have all you have your creativity switched off. I am in the playful mode
00:19:59 I'm in the creative mode. I'm I'm just there are no bad ideas, right?
00:20:03 I just I just tied lotus juice
00:20:06 So the opium was you saying I'm not on that's the worst joke
00:20:09 I'm gonna make on this podcast unless I really dive deep never say never alright. We still have three more hours
00:20:15 Joy join me snake in the creative in the creative clouds
00:20:20 No, I'm already paying for adobe. Oh
00:20:23 What if
00:20:25 Lotus juice seems like a weird like like a vape flavor
00:20:29 Oh, it will be one day. It sounds good. If lotus juice isn't selling lotus juice. He is not one brand
00:20:37 No idea what it would taste you have a hole in the market. It's time to capitalize on it
00:20:41 You got to start making I context of that changes then if a guy called lotus juice is selling juice with his name
00:20:47 I have to wonder where the juice comes from and then well, you know
00:20:50 You know, he could do like the Lil Nas X thing and he could sell shoes with his blood in them
00:20:55 And he could say like this shoe contains the lotus juice
00:21:00 It's already got blood so we're just gonna have to like he's gonna have to have his glands squeezed and
00:21:11 We can go lower we can we can yet do worse
00:21:14 We can drill I
00:21:16 Think I think they did fill the niche in the vape market that I was waiting for I think someone finally did make caffeinated vape juice
00:21:25 Which is a godsend does that work? I don't know I wish I said I wish I still vape
00:21:31 I wish I still vape so I could try it
00:21:34 I hear I hear from my friend that they don't know they don't make vape juice without like nicotine in it anymore
00:21:40 Is that true? You've got to be able to find some without nicotine
00:21:44 I mean, I haven't really looked
00:21:46 You used to be able to find it. It would be it would be really fucked up
00:21:50 It would be really fucked up if they did like a crackdown on it and the result was not that like you can't buy the flavored
00:21:57 Kind anymore because it appeals to kids
00:21:59 It's that you can't buy the non nicotine that you can still buy the flavors the kids like but you have to get it with nicotine
00:22:05 They cracked down on the nicotine free because the kids were getting into it. That would be fucked the most
00:22:11 That's exactly what they would do. I've got the dumbest feeling on vapes and cigarettes
00:22:17 I don't smoke. I've never smoked. I'm
00:22:20 Thankfully way too cheap to ever take up smoking if I want yeah, but that's a that's a big
00:22:27 When I'm walking behind someone and they blow a big plume or something and it smells like vanilla instead of cigarette smoke
00:22:33 I'm like that's wrong
00:22:35 Fill my own fill my lungs with cigarette smoke, please
00:22:40 I'm gonna kill you stop wait wait wait you're saying that you would prefer it to be cigarette smoke
00:22:46 Yes, I asked smoke is fucking granted die. No, I love that smell
00:22:51 I know
00:22:53 The smell I also like the smell when I was is nostalgic
00:22:57 But I definitely don't like reading it in because I was scared to death by like videos of like
00:23:03 Here's what a fucking lung looks like if you smoke and it's like like a like a creepypasta scary monster
00:23:09 And I'm like, oh, no, I don't want that to happen
00:23:11 And then when I every time I see a person smoking I hold my breath
00:23:15 I don't I was a little kid when I was a little kid
00:23:18 The only person who I ever spent much time around who smoked was my grandpa
00:23:21 And when I went to his house his house smelled like cigarettes and I liked my grandpa and I liked that smell and I thought it smelled nice
00:23:29 There are times when I think
00:23:32 Like when I when I used to smoke I would catch myself smelling like cigarettes and I'd be like this is disgusting
00:23:37 This is horrible. This is a nightmare. My breath is gross. Why am I why live, right?
00:23:43 But but occasionally I will catch someone else smoking and I will get a whiff and be like
00:23:48 Kind of nice though. I kind of like that though kind of want that. I should ignore that feeling
00:23:53 I should point out just for clarity's sake. I'm not saying that I've taken the smart opinion on this
00:23:59 Just that that's the way my brain has been foiled. I disagree. I
00:24:03 Don't I don't understand I don't understand I like the smell of cigarettes
00:24:07 But I like the smell of vapes better like I like a good a good smell of smell of like like menthol watermelon
00:24:14 It's like delightful
00:24:15 men fall water to me. It's just it's me. It's like
00:24:19 Some weird Senate. It's not even synesthesia. What am I talking about this feels like reality isn't quite adding up
00:24:24 They're cheating snake. They're they're gonna smoke. Oh, yeah smoke the good shit. They got a guy
00:24:34 Commitment to the bit when I when I light it when I light a scented candle like I just it's such an uncanny
00:24:39 It's like why does it smell like like bananas and walnuts like my reality is fizz collapsing
00:24:48 Mankind was not meant to live like this
00:24:50 You're taking me on one here. You're moving me a step beyond what I mean
00:24:54 I'm talking about when I'm walking down the high street and it's grotty and horrible and I'm in London
00:24:59 So it's just human misery all around me if someone isn't smoking to die
00:25:03 I want it to smell miserable. Yeah, I want I want the app most to be perfect. I want to breathe in and go
00:25:09 Yeah, this is my town
00:25:14 All right, okay, that's not quiet. I take it back. You can live that's funny
00:25:19 If if they can live as long as I'm allowed to with this air quality
00:25:24 It needs to be in like a hipster trendy part of London if it's like a sweet weird smelling vape
00:25:30 Oh, yeah, yeah, I feel you on that is this closer to the set
00:25:33 There's like a bubble tea shop and like stuff like that then the vapes can the vapes can be like different colors
00:25:39 They can be coming out as pink and green. Yeah, someone is you know, just blowing out a plume of that or someone else is choking on a tapioca
00:25:46 They should have like themed vapes for different parts of cities like in Italian districts
00:25:53 You could have like olive oil a pizza a pizza flavor. Yeah
00:25:58 Oh my god, I'm just thinking of London tourist vapes and I'm getting disgusted
00:26:03 You have you have corned beef
00:26:06 Like a baby like the tower London
00:26:09 Well, it's like jelly. Do you remember a like Willy Wonka Willy Wonka had those like pills that were like an entire
00:26:16 Three-course meal. Why not vape? Oh first? I vape my mashed potatoes
00:26:20 Then I vape my my turkey and and and cranberry sauce then finally I vape my pumpkin pie. Ah, it's a whole Thanksgiving meal
00:26:30 The dystopic food pill into the dystopic vape wait, what if we could vape on the blockchain
00:26:39 No
00:26:40 So like so like you get you mine coins by I don't know
00:26:44 I don't know what I mean by that
00:26:48 What you do is you suck in from an e-pen or an e-sig or whatever is then you put your mouth to a hard drive and you just blow it in
00:26:57 That creates
00:27:00 You just have the pen the vape pens wirelessly connected to your phone or your computer and like every time you inhale
00:27:06 It can calculate how much you're inhaling and the more you inhale you get rewarded with vape coin
00:27:12 So like if you just like keep vape the more you vape the more vape coin you mine
00:27:16 And then you can trade it for a theory or something and buy your your vape NFTs
00:27:21 You know and then they'd they'd have like like like mass-produce vape mining operations where people sitting in a room
00:27:29 Like 16 vape pens in their mouth sort of time like an opioid den
00:27:33 But just a bunch of people vape a bunch of crypto bros just vaping for the dear life
00:27:37 I've got all the crypto bros that have popcorn lung and Bitcoin just like disappears
00:27:42 There's a supervisor walking around saying if you're good today, you get the vanilla flavor
00:27:49 I'm so sick of the olive oil flavor man, please
00:27:52 We can convert we can convert like our smoggy our smoggy like industrial cities billowing out plumes of smoke
00:28:00 No from now on it's gonna be big clouds of like yeah of like a blueberry muffin
00:28:06 scented
00:28:09 Diacetyl of vapor just into the clouds surrounding the atmosphere
00:28:14 Filling filling up filling up the ozone layer
00:28:18 But it'll smell nicer the plumes coming off of like a nuclear power plant would be
00:28:23 Centered and it would make the whole area around taste great when it rains all the time cup out and you can catch the juice
00:28:31 And it will be great
00:28:34 She's like mommy mommy the rain tastes like a taste like menthol the rain tastes like
00:28:40 Grapes grape menthol. That's my favorite by the way. My favorite flavor was always the fruit menthol combos. That was
00:28:47 I love it. That's so that's what I keep going back to
00:28:51 What what is the taste of menthol? I can only think of methamphetamine. I know that's not what it is, right?
00:28:57 Well, have you ever yeah, it's like mint. Have you ever had like a menthol cough drop?
00:29:01 Yeah, it's like a like a mint. Okay. I know what really weird because I
00:29:06 When I'm recording, I'll get like Fisherman's friends, which are menthol flavored and it just tastes
00:29:11 Cold wait you the Fisherman's. Yeah
00:29:16 What's that? Does that help with recording using like cough drops or something?
00:29:20 It helps with sore throat and it
00:29:23 It basically if you're talking too much and you're not talking properly, which I'm very very bad at narration
00:29:27 After 10 years, I was hoping I'd get better, but I just I don't know
00:29:30 I guess if you think it's as long as you so
00:29:33 I
00:29:35 Just I use those which they're like a menthol sweet which soothes the throat and just kind of helps
00:29:41 Yeah, if you've ever had like if you've ever had like a menthol cough drop like a cherry menthol
00:29:45 Like it tastes like cherry, but it's just kind of got like a little like a sort of like cool minty icy
00:29:51 Mentholiness to it
00:29:53 Like like like icicles are growing on the back of you the throat sort of
00:29:58 Pretty much like a very extreme delightful
00:30:02 delightful
00:30:05 Man, well, I don't even know what we're talking about anymore. How did how did this happen?
00:30:10 Where I was very weird chain from racist uncles in sport to the blockchain, which by the way
00:30:16 Crypto just crashed the other day
00:30:19 Oh
00:30:20 That's one of the items on my list. That's one of the items on my topic list was the crypto crash
00:30:25 I'm so sorry. I just had some I'm sorry. I had to mention no
00:30:30 I mean, I'm excited. It was a pretty big one. It dropped like 20% in like one day. Yeah, it was pretty brutal
00:30:36 Did something like a bit what caused it? I bought the dip. Did you buy the dip then?
00:30:42 Did you actually buy the dip? I did I bought two hundred dollars with Ethereum on the dip
00:30:46 Uh, no, I did not no, I did not buy the dip
00:30:49 I'm not convinced that it will not continue to crash
00:30:53 It probably will go through like I someone would mentioned because I've been knee-deep in those research for this fucking video
00:30:58 That like it's gonna crash during the holidays as people cash out to like buy holiday gifts and stuff
00:31:03 Are you making a crypto video for like?
00:31:06 I have like a 12-page video right now on NFTs and why they're bad and it's a deep
00:31:12 It's a deep dive. My brain is permanently infected with garbage the common section for that video is gonna be great. Oh, okay
00:31:19 But I mean the the avatars of that comment section
00:31:26 Clicks ready boys, we're gonna have to take them all is
00:31:30 Do we know what caused the the big crash the other day because I have no idea
00:31:34 It was because of all those fainting beat. They stopped being able to vape. They yeah
00:31:39 Yeah
00:31:41 I actually want to know okay, but does anybody know why these things happen? Like I said like like I
00:31:47 Sometimes there are like sometimes some country who passes some legislation and there's like oh as a market response
00:31:53 Well, like I said, I'd heard I'd heard that like it tends to crash a little bit
00:31:58 Around the holidays as people like cash out to like use them their gains to like buy stuff for Christmas and shit
00:32:03 I don't know if that was the entirety of it
00:32:06 But I expect it probably to kind of be rather low for the rest of the year as people continue to do that. I
00:32:13 Didn't buy any dip
00:32:15 But what I did do was I complained before about how a bunch of I had a bunch of stable coins that I got from some app
00:32:21 That like some tax youtuber may it recommended me to try and I tried it and now I have a bunch of like
00:32:29 USDT and USDC
00:32:31 So and then I I said this before
00:32:34 STD
00:32:37 We call them STIs now actually
00:32:42 The the anyway, yeah, I had them in this app and I tried to transfer them out and they ended up in
00:32:48 Not my not my coinbase wallet, but my wallet in my coinbase wallet app
00:32:54 So my coinbase wallet wallet so they're in my coinbase wallet wallet
00:32:58 But I can't transfer them to my coinbase wallet without paying gas and the gas was outrageous
00:33:03 They wanted me to pay more in gas than I even have in the account
00:33:07 That's cuz coinbase coinbase the app and coinbase wallet are two different things. I
00:33:12 Know that now
00:33:15 Guess so I guess so I've been so I've been waiting for so I had a little bit of Bitcoin
00:33:19 I had like $80 worth of Bitcoin. I had a little bit of USDT USDC
00:33:22 So I sent my I converted my Bitcoin to
00:33:26 Ethereum and I'm gonna send the Ethereum I sent the Ethereum to the Bitcoin wallet wallet
00:33:31 And now I'm waiting for gas fees to go down low enough that I can use that Ethereum that was Bitcoin to pay
00:33:38 The gas the ether gas fee to transfer my USDT and USDC for my coinbase wallet wallet to my coinbase wallet
00:33:45 And then cash them out and that's the plan and this is all to get like a hundred and fifty dollars
00:33:49 This has been like a month's long process
00:33:53 Arturning is much better. Carturning is awesome. I got a new one the other day
00:33:59 The American Express blue business card doesn't count towards my 520 limit 524 limit
00:34:06 Fuck yeah, I'm excited. I'm back on the churn, baby
00:34:10 Back in the chain. Yeah, I'm gonna make a hundred dollars during this podcast by finishing a commission. That's what I do
00:34:17 What are you well? Oh, that's multi-tasking. I
00:34:21 Think I've mentioned this before but I used to be in the my little pony community shocking
00:34:26 Terrible, are you making more are you making more vectors? Yeah, I am
00:34:32 I did a lot of animation and I made rigs
00:34:35 Very similar to the ones for used on the show. In fact, I have the rigs from the show
00:34:40 There are like animation files that were leaked from the show years ago, but I had access to before anyone else
00:34:46 So I've like studied how I do things. I built these animation rigs and
00:34:50 You know, you know how you know your youtubers who have their little like character in the corner
00:34:54 It's just a bunch of PNGs that they swap out similar
00:34:58 Who would do such a thing the arm crosses who would do such a thing or pony analysis channels
00:35:02 I mean my god, who are they we've moved into the third dimension now
00:35:06 We use fully fully modeled 3d rigs to do our to emote for our youtubers. It's true
00:35:11 I am being outclassed slowly, but I basically used my animation rig to make a hundred and fifty poses in
00:35:18 flash and each pose is just a keyframe in the program and
00:35:23 So son will commission me a hundred bucks for a hundred images or a hundred and fifty images for, you know
00:35:29 120 bucks of their character and all I have to do is just draw the hair once slap it in and it's done
00:35:34 Hmm, and I go I was gonna have to vector hair and recolor and that's it. That sounds kind of smart not hard
00:35:40 I guess yeah, definitely up your rates
00:35:45 I
00:35:46 Everyone I think my rates are good because something a lot of especially when they accept easy designs
00:35:50 I can do it in like an hour. Yeah, ours
00:35:54 No reason not
00:35:57 Yeah, I've hit the sweet spot for what people are willing to pay people don't want to pay more than that
00:36:02 So okay, okay, I think I'm the market started to start accepting a theorem then that's when you'll really fucking. Oh
00:36:09 No
00:36:11 Tom stop
00:36:17 You know I should
00:36:19 At some point I really do think at some point the the crypto bubble is gonna pop and I just it is
00:36:26 And I just don't want and I just don't want to be holding the bag
00:36:29 I just don't want to be holding the bag when that happens. We don't have you want to get in and get out
00:36:34 The easiest thing to do is to not grab the bag at all. I
00:36:38 Try to get in and get out
00:36:39 I tried to get in and get out during the last big rally and I ended up I waited too long and I cashed out and I lost like a
00:36:45 Little bit. I've mostly broke even and so I'm like, what's the point? I can't time the market. I don't know what shit's gonna
00:36:51 Do, what's the fucking man exactly?
00:36:54 It's genuinely all just gambling by another name
00:37:00 They're totally gonna we totally have the resources and energy to do that
00:37:06 Totally, I'm sure NFTs are gonna replace emojis. Just you wait. I want to hear what they're gonna do
00:37:12 I I just wanted to like point out my own stupidity and why I will not I ever expect anyone to but just never take
00:37:19 Financial advice from me because I own thirty nine thousand shares in Napster
00:37:24 No, that's funny
00:37:27 Wait, whoa, when did you buy them for thirty nine cents? They are thirty nine cents now
00:37:34 So I've lost
00:37:36 But so here's the thing about so I I got into stocks trading the whole GME thing happened
00:37:41 I thought I'm too late to get onto GME, but I've been
00:37:43 I lost I lost a couple hundred dollars on me. I didn't go on GME. It just kind of reminded me
00:37:48 Hey, I've been being start doing stocks for a while. Let's let's take a punt on it
00:37:53 I've got a bit of money spare and this does go against what I said earlier about me being too cheap to smoke
00:37:57 But I am perfectly willing I set aside a hundred
00:38:00 But not too cheap to buy Napster shares. It's never too late
00:38:03 But here's okay
00:38:05 Not that this excuses my later decision-making, but
00:38:10 What I started as was when I was just looking around for companies to invest and I saw on as alone
00:38:14 It was a company called Melody VR and its whole its whole modus operandi. Whatever fuck was
00:38:21 That we do 360 degree
00:38:25 Videos of concerts and my brain just I'm very simplistic on it
00:38:29 I was just like hey, maybe when covid's over and there are concerts again
00:38:32 That sounds like a cool venture and like headsets are becoming more common
00:38:35 That sounds like something people might like and I threw in a few quid
00:38:39 Turns out Melody VR is the company that acquired and bought Napster
00:38:43 Um years ago and then at some point just decided hey, we're gonna start trading under the name Napster again
00:38:49 So it was like they just pulled the cloak off and like we're Napster actually
00:38:53 We
00:38:55 And then it just kept going lower and lower and at this point. I don't expect to make money on it
00:39:00 I just kind of want to know how many fucking Napster stocks can I have
00:39:05 Can I eventually trip Elon Musk into boosting it?
00:39:09 Can I make it a revenge thing against Grimes? I don't actually believe those last two steps, but you know
00:39:16 Can you why would they change their name to a thing that is associated with like an old
00:39:21 outdated here's the messed up thing I since learned which is Napster is still functional and has a music storefront
00:39:28 Just no one cares or knows not even I own stock in it and I don't care or no. I just have spot of
00:39:34 I think I think I remember hearing that they um
00:39:38 They tried bringing back Napster like a few years ago
00:39:42 Oh, like there's report. There's multiple reports. They say we're bringing it back in 2023. I'm sure sure you're fucking up
00:39:49 It's it's the equivalent of like owning the name myspace and trying to make a comeback when everybody is associated
00:39:57 Myspace with like oh that one that failed and facebook won
00:40:01 Like nobody would get interested in a new myspace. I mean, I guess I mean a lot of these old companies
00:40:05 They still keep puttering around doing
00:40:08 God knows what um, but like they continue to exist and have some sort of
00:40:13 Presence like I don't know who uses them, but like maybe somebody does and that's we're still pulling in
00:40:19 uh
00:40:20 about like
00:40:21 Several million a year enough to remain technically functional
00:40:26 But you know, they're never really good. They're never going to be in the public zeitgeist again
00:40:30 Yeah, like like they've had their fame and they've scuppered it. They need a new name because otherwise
00:40:37 Nobody will yeah exactly
00:40:40 Like I I wasn't even on the internet when Napster was
00:40:43 Influential I didn't get internet
00:40:45 till 2003 when and I only heard about Napster in retrospect
00:40:50 My generation was using limewire to nice to steal everything. Yeah
00:40:55 I was limewire and memories of limewire. Yeah
00:40:58 My knowledge never saw limewire
00:41:01 My Napster knowledge pretty much begins and ends the episode of Futurama
00:41:06 Where they oh, yeah, where they make like robots of celebrities or something
00:41:12 Oh, was it kidnapped? Yeah, they're kidnapped. Yes. Oh, yeah
00:41:18 I feel really bad with Futurama because I think when I was a teenager
00:41:23 I knew near enough every episode word for word and it's all gone now
00:41:27 I want to get back into it. I haven't watched it. I never I never watched the uh, the re the reboot
00:41:33 I
00:41:36 I I watched a couple episodes and yeah, it's not on it
00:41:40 The average quality is not as good as the original fox run, but there are still some gems in there
00:41:46 The original
00:41:47 Futurama writing team seasons one to five were it was a room full of phd's
00:41:53 Yeah, we're just making whatever joke entertain them
00:41:58 Well, it was that wasn't a family guy writers and it's it loses some some of that
00:42:03 Wasn't the team originally like a bunch of like the best talent from the simpsons team got like put like sort of
00:42:10 Yeah, it was it was led by it was led by david x cohen formally david s cohen
00:42:15 Yeah, and he just grabbed some of the smartest people he knew and just let them loose on making the most obscure gags
00:42:22 They could while just being funny along the way
00:42:25 Yeah, and that's kind of how you get futurama. It's this weird flash in a pan
00:42:30 Honestly, I believe something that shouldn't have happened, but
00:42:34 It did
00:42:35 Yeah, glad it did
00:42:36 It's it's funny how like 50%
00:42:39 Like 50% of number file videos I watch there'll be like a segment where they're like, yeah, futurama reference fist
00:42:45 Like it always happens
00:42:47 lol
00:42:49 I thought I thought you were making a joke like like 50% of number
00:42:53 File and then you were gonna make up some like
00:42:56 Weird statistic like you're gonna like be like, oh, yeah
00:42:59 Actually, according to number like the number file numbers followed like the fibonacci sequence
00:43:04 If you spiral it out or something if you take the square root, I don't know it didn't happen
00:43:09 I don't know never mind. Well the reason all I don't know mathematics jokes is impossible
00:43:14 It is impossible. You need to know numbers. I and that just doesn't add up
00:43:18 I make jokes
00:43:20 Fucking numbers
00:43:21 We already talked about this words are bad. You has to be instrumentals only if you can you have to make me laugh at your instruments
00:43:29 I've been getting yes. I love the sound of a trumpet
00:43:33 It really makes it really gets me going
00:43:36 I've been getting the most I've ever gotten out of my physics degree
00:43:39 As I mentioned during the pre show I have been
00:43:43 Uh, I've been making I've been doing my programming shit
00:43:46 I've been making making codes and shit and I use numbers
00:43:50 All the time they said they said they I said I'd never learn I'd never need to know about how
00:43:56 Oh, what is the the acceleration is equal to the square root of the the mass of the times of gravity?
00:44:03 Well, guess what I'm doing it. I'm I'm I'm making animations and stuff. It's gonna be it's gonna be
00:44:10 I am a dang I'm I think I gotta be a nerd I'm I'm getting like
00:44:14 I don't think I could have kept at the greek the game grind this long if I wasn't a dang nerd
00:44:20 And I get
00:44:22 I'm a jock game reviewer
00:44:25 Chad chad virgin game developer the chad game reviewer
00:44:30 Yeah, that's that's telling me about mario jumping in a parabola
00:44:35 I have I could not have stuck with it if I did not get a perverse
00:44:39 Uh, a nerd pleasure out of when I when I type in yeah when I when I make a little formula and then like
00:44:45 Oh, here's he's gonna move according to this formula and then I boot up the game
00:44:48 And I see him and he moves in the in the correct arc and I go
00:44:51 Aha, like oh, I'll I'll define I'll define such and such to go according to this formula and then I see it and I'm like
00:44:57 Yep, that's that's the waveform. It tickles that like residual gone god complex
00:45:02 All of us nerds have for being fucking bullied and having no control growing up. It's like now they all listen
00:45:09 Absolutely
00:45:11 Absolutely, that's why I named all of the characters in my game off my childhood bullies. So I could
00:45:16 Yeah, exactly. No. No. No. No. Hey. Hey. Hey, this is my
00:45:21 I made I made a little game called hatred and have you ever heard of it? But yeah, that was that was how I work
00:45:24 Oh, that was you the trauma. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And yeah, this
00:45:29 This brings me to okay. This brings me to another topic one of the topics on my list that I wanted to bring up
00:45:33 I have I have a conundrum
00:45:35 Where I'm getting close to be able to release this I already talked told
00:45:40 I think give and tom and probably tech also. I mentioned this too
00:45:45 Uh, I I'm getting closer to be able to release it
00:45:48 And I want to put it on steam. Oh, yes
00:45:51 and I am
00:45:53 Cons and I am and I'm wondering
00:45:55 Are they gonna be mad if it has like music from an old SNES game in it? Yes. Yes, they will. Yes, really
00:46:02 Is something is something actually gonna happen because I yeah, I find I find it
00:46:07 I find it kind of hard to believe that anyone would even notice
00:46:11 I
00:46:12 I think
00:46:13 Them not noticing is likely, but like there will be consequences for you and your game if it gets caught
00:46:20 You are absolutely playing with fire. Just the context of one the one bit of history
00:46:24 I have with this and it's not quite SNES music
00:46:27 Okay
00:46:29 Um, you know the yeek devs
00:46:31 Their previous games and brothers that had bitcrushed shadow of the colossus music in it and you can't you can't buy that game anymore
00:46:37 And that is one bit of flak that's going to follow them around forever
00:46:41 So I'd say I mean and this is just my perspective on it
00:46:45 Here's even if you think you can get away with it
00:46:47 You probably can't and you would be taking the reputation hit
00:46:51 Just what I'm saying. Hold on. Hold on. I hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is okay
00:46:56 I'm not saying I'm not intending to pass off it as my own work
00:47:00 Like I was intending to be like credit in the credits like this music is I took this music from this game, right?
00:47:06 Like that's what I wasn't I wasn't gonna plagiarize. I was gonna be like, yeah, it's credited. This is not my music
00:47:13 I don't think that matters
00:47:17 Because you need the licensing rights or that just lets everybody know that you knew exactly what you did and did it anyway
00:47:22 I don't yeah, because you're gonna sound like stealing something from someone admitting you did it but like
00:47:26 But it's okay. Hold on. It's not plagiarism. Okay. It might be no. We're not saying it's plagiarism anymore
00:47:32 We're saying it's yeah, it's intellectual. It's violating copyright
00:47:38 Stealing from who though from square square doesn't even exist anymore. There's square enix now the game was never even localized
00:47:44 You're trying to they still own the fucking trademark. Just convince yourself. This is okay. Yes. Tell me what I want to hear
00:47:51 Right now
00:47:53 There's so many people. This one we're involved. You gotta you gotta go back to doing musicians. You have access to musicians find someone from the piece
00:48:00 I don't want to. You could release it on itch. I feel like you could release it on itch and be fine
00:48:04 I'll say all right. It could still be a bad look but you could do it
00:48:08 But I wouldn't put it on steam. I'll fucking kill you. I'll fucking end you. It will not be a bad look
00:48:11 It's not a fucking bad look. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with everyone to be like? Then why are you asking the question?
00:48:16 Why are you asking the question? Let me say this in a way that
00:48:18 You're admitted to violating copyright law. It'll get I don't think it's a bad look
00:48:22 I don't think it unless I charge for it. If I charged for it. Maybe it would be a bad look if I wasn't
00:48:27 I still think you then just distribute the game via napster, then you'll be on brand
00:48:32 Just put it on just put it on napster and have everyone to be able to download it from there and then you'll be on
00:48:40 39 shares will finally go up in value. You know everybody everybody wins
00:48:45 Yeah, when I'm a millionaire, I'll be able to say the pcp got me here
00:48:51 I'm going to put it on itch no matter I was gonna put it on itch for free
00:48:54 But then I was like hey, I could technically put it on steam if I wanted to I did not know that you were gonna just make it free
00:49:02 Yeah, I still think it's a problem. I guess I guess it makes sense because it follows on from a comic
00:49:06 But I assume since it's on steam you you'd probably want it to to get paid for
00:49:11 The game is already a nightmare of like stolen intellectual property. It's already that then I wouldn't put it on steam
00:49:19 That's the point god. Okay. I feel like it's it's funnier that way. Well, I mean if you like you just pull one out
00:49:26 Hey, I got this legal action. That's funny. Then go for it
00:49:30 What's that what you're saying snake? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was talking over you
00:49:34 It's just I feel like you just pulled the hell of a fucking joke on us with
00:49:37 Oh, yeah, it's got this one SNES track in it and then we zoom out and then there's all these intellectual characters
00:49:42 No, no, no, what I mean what I mean is that like in terms of inter I'll tell you the exact specs in terms of like assets
00:49:49 There is music from uh front mission gun hazard
00:49:53 There are a few sprites and sound effects from secretive mana
00:49:57 and uh mario rpg
00:49:59 I'm pretty sure those release the us
00:50:01 Those released in the us, but okay, but the music but the music did not release in the us
00:50:05 All right, but I mean the the game is the game is based on a comic, which is I mean it's
00:50:11 It's it's it the main character is a my little pony fan character and it's about his uh, it's it's it's it's also involves a
00:50:20 sonichu, which is also, you know, uh
00:50:23 Has its own intellectual property that definitely falls under parody. That's definitely fine
00:50:29 Well, maybe my use of uh the front mission gun hazard song is also
00:50:36 I was making a comment. It's a commentary on the original and how good of music it is
00:50:40 It's very much. I like it and want to put it in a video game
00:50:43 I thought we threw the gameplay just have a character say damn this tune is rocking and it's like we did it boys
00:50:48 We defeated
00:50:50 I got so excited my headphones fell out for a second
00:50:53 I might might be right but now it's for now. It's for the purposes of review and critique
00:50:57 That's how I get exactly
00:50:59 Actually, that's how
00:51:01 Get away with everything
00:51:03 You should have a character say wow this this you should have phantom horn do a a t-bap on that song
00:51:09 And then it would be fine
00:51:11 It would be a review
00:51:14 Okay, well, fuck you guys. You didn't tell me you didn't give me the answer. I wanted so how is that not the answer?
00:51:19 You wanted that's a great idea. It's funny. You do it
00:51:22 Oh, okay. Thank you. It's the one my my guy my guy livid now you can make the final boss of your game us
00:51:28 Shutting down your Ben. Here's what you could do. Here's what you could do
00:51:33 Yeah, I
00:51:34 You could probably do something
00:51:35 I know like a lot of like porn games on steam do something similar to this where they release like a
00:51:40 censored version of the game on steam and then they point to a like a
00:51:43 A way to patch the game with like the the porn scenes in it
00:51:47 What you could do is you could release the game on steam without the music and then like
00:51:51 Like subtly nudge to to a patch that patches in the the front mission gun hazard music. There you go
00:51:58 That might work with the porn game example rather than all the yakuza mods that
00:52:04 patch back in
00:52:07 No, I of course I think of the porn games before yakuza. No, I mean that's my my game has more has a more direct lineage to
00:52:16 To porn to porn visual novels those mass three games. Yeah
00:52:20 Yeah
00:52:23 Okay, that's an idea that's uh
00:52:25 I will continue to uh, I will continue to mull this this conundrum over
00:52:30 Uh in my spare time
00:52:33 You should put it on the epic game store instead
00:52:35 That'll be
00:52:38 Supposed to exclusively we love phantom horn ben we want your game
00:52:42 Fans of big big t-bap fans speak speaking of big t-bap fans. This is crazy. My sister called me the other day
00:52:49 My sister is a tattoo is a tattoo artist. She was famously on the podcast one time when she said you're a dog
00:52:56 You're you're a dog and i'm sick of it
00:52:58 um
00:52:59 And and she called me the other day to tell me that one of her customers like a guy who had come to get a tattoo from her
00:53:06 they were chatting and she brought up her brothers who had a
00:53:10 A my little pony youtube channel and the guy was like what's their channel called and she told him and he knew
00:53:17 He he okay. She's she specifically asked wait is ben saint your brother. He didn't ask about keg standard
00:53:23 He asked is ben saint your brother
00:53:26 Uh, he knew t-bap. This was I know
00:53:30 Crazy shit. So so my sister just got a lifelong customer out of that
00:53:35 Uh
00:53:36 Some guy walked in was like, yeah, I want a tattoo a tattoo every week comes in just like what's ben saint up to
00:53:42 What kind of debauchery is he getting into this week? I I want a I would like a tramp stamp
00:53:47 Please on the back so that it looks like when I'm wearing pants so that it looks like uh phantom horn
00:53:53 Is coming out of of the right side of my pants and and keg standard is sticking out of the left side
00:53:58 Shouldn't be the other way around
00:54:00 No phantom horn was on the right. Oh, okay
00:54:03 He's right like separated by the arse. He moves slowly left over time
00:54:12 Anyway, I thought that was very funny that that is very small world
00:54:17 Small world small world
00:54:19 Uh, all right. So that's that's two
00:54:24 That's two of my items. That was both of my two items off my topics list. I'm done
00:54:29 I've said all I have to say about this week
00:54:32 I
00:54:33 I've got a thing to say
00:54:36 It's pikmin bloom. Oh god. I love pikmin bloom and I'm gonna say it again
00:54:41 I want to ask people in in in the call
00:54:45 Have you played pikmin bloom and do you know how cool it is? I have not I've seen it. I'm sorry
00:54:50 I thought it was like pokemon go thing, but different probably. Yes. It's it's different from pokemon go. It's just it's just good
00:54:57 I've just never I've never played pokemon go ever in my life
00:55:01 Pikmin is about tiny little people who come out of the ground and then they help you do things
00:55:06 Yeah, um
00:55:08 And that's that's that's what they do sick. So you it's a you grow slaves. What?
00:55:13 You you grow a little? No, they like slaves
00:55:16 Yeah, just like just like pokemon
00:55:19 It sounds like just like pokemon. They like it. It sounds like justification to me. It's different. I swear
00:55:23 But I mean we got we got nintendo's classic franchises, you know
00:55:27 Like cock fighting with pokemon and slavery with pikmin. It's just like fun for all ages
00:55:32 No, he's like, you know, Miyamoto said that, you know zelda was like the forest he explored and pokemon was the bug catching
00:55:39 Now it's just taking it back to when his family had the plantation
00:55:45 Miyamoto Miyamoto made he made pikmin to remind him of all the good times he had as a child uh helming the slave ships from africa
00:55:54 and
00:55:56 That's why that's why the ships legs sprout in a triangle. It's to represent the transit
00:56:02 Yeah, captain olamar. I cut myself off. I cut myself captain olamar is actually based off of uh, uncle remiss
00:56:09 his uh, his old friend from
00:56:16 I want to cut through the irony for a split moment just say pikmin one and two are very good
00:56:20 I never played three. Yes. I never played them because I was not a game cube guy
00:56:25 They're cool
00:56:26 I'm really
00:56:28 They make me really anxious because I always feel terrible when like any pikmin dies and like you're not going to make it
00:56:33 Do that game without losing a couple of them. Oh, no, I
00:56:36 Have tried for a zero death
00:56:38 I've I've very gotten I've gotten very close as like the second boss was the first time one of them died
00:56:43 I was very angry reset the game like it's fire and bloom
00:56:47 Yeah, anyway, anyway pikmin bloom
00:56:50 um, you have your little pikmin
00:56:52 And you pick them up out of the ground you you grow them by walking with steps
00:56:57 So it counts your steps and the thing that I've learned
00:57:00 Aside from the fact that it's like it's not as stressful as pokemon go is with like
00:57:06 There's billions of pokemon and you just have to once you've found all of the common ones
00:57:11 You're just sort of waiting and there's nothing to do until you see. Oh, there's a cool one nearby and then you go
00:57:16 um, it counts your steps and it records um
00:57:21 You can plant flowers as you walk to increase
00:57:24 The chance of you finding an expedition which is sort of like a little mission
00:57:28 You can send your pikmin on together like a grape or something
00:57:33 Um, and then you can bring it back and make nectar which you can use to make more flower petals
00:57:37 But the flower petals are server side
00:57:40 Um, and everybody can see them so you can see like frequently warped paths
00:57:44 And that's cool. Yeah, but the thing I like about it
00:57:48 Is that in pokemon go
00:57:50 the high
00:57:52 Like amount of pokemon like a lot of pokemon spawn in like densely populated areas
00:57:57 So you always have to go to the major cities in order to get loads of pokemon and loads of poker stops
00:58:03 Which kind of defeats the purpose of exploring
00:58:05 You just sort of go to a place where there's like 10 poker stops in walking distance
00:58:08 You walk around the block and then you go home to your probably less in the middle of the city
00:58:15 You know place and it's like there's nothing to do especially out in the country. There's nothing to do
00:58:19 But with pikmin it counts your steps and everything is about just how far you can walk
00:58:25 So it's completely the opposite you are it encouraged to go on long walks
00:58:30 To rack up the steps so that you can grow more pikmin more quickly
00:58:35 Plant flowers everywhere and then go and find
00:58:38 You know expeditions for your pikmin to go on
00:58:40 And I really like that because going on walks was the whole reason I sort of
00:58:45 Got into not the whole reason but part of the reason I liked pokemon go as a game
00:58:49 And then once I realized that I would never go for a walk unless there was a rare pokemon that I needed
00:58:55 Um, I realized it was terrible for walks
00:58:58 And but pikmin is pikmin bloom is great. Do you want to get some exercise?
00:59:03 I do need to get more cardio
00:59:05 But it's fucking cold now
00:59:07 Why couldn't they release in the spring?
00:59:10 I can actually I just got a new phone my phone has been has been unusably bad for like a year now
00:59:14 And I finally just got another one in the mail. I got to activate it. Dude download pikmin bloom right now
00:59:20 Maybe I fucking will maybe I don't know
00:59:23 It's funny because you had the countryside
00:59:25 And where you didn't have much to do and I have london
00:59:28 And I had a somewhat different experience with it, which is just walking around london
00:59:34 Can kind of be shit
00:59:35 Especially when it's like a pokemon will be somewhere. It's like that's kind of a dodgy neighborhood. I don't yeah
00:59:40 Yeah, I don't want to do that. Do I want to stick my neck out of that?
00:59:44 And it's like it's never it's not that bad, but there are moments where it's like
00:59:47 Mmm, don't don't like that area. Do I want to go there for that?
00:59:52 Do I want to have a walk in sheffield for a snorlax? Not quite not today, I would say
00:59:59 You know I grab I grab my handgun and I'm like right we're going to we're going to peck them
01:00:05 Let's uh
01:00:06 Take a chance is yeah, and the chancey folks whether
01:00:11 Dead or alive pickpocket alleyway. I had to break out the squad and we had to infiltrate to
01:00:17 Liberate a pokemon
01:00:19 That's what that's a new to in buckingham palace. You just have to storm it
01:00:23 I mean, I'd say hello to the queen on the way out challenger to a duel
01:00:27 I'll think of all the cool pokemon get blown away by the palace guard
01:00:32 I don't know if the queen has a smartphone. I've always wondered that and I've never seen her with one anymore. She's dead, dude
01:00:38 Oh, yeah, she's done. I know she's in the hospital. She's got to have like some some like like a nintendo switch
01:00:44 She's gonna be reborn the only nintendo switch she has she's like hooked up to and it's somehow her consciousness is being uploaded to it
01:00:52 It's keeping her alive
01:00:54 She's in a cocoon. She's gonna turn into a bead drill or a butterfly. We don't know which one
01:00:58 Please don't switch off her life support
01:01:07 You know what they're doing they're they're minting her they're minting her on the blockchain
01:01:21 Save the queen
01:01:24 Ah, it's the only way to keep her alive is to put her in the in the in the god's right place to queen
01:01:32 You're right clicking the queen right click saving the queen is a punishable by death offense
01:01:36 So you will be found
01:01:38 But I thought you're supposed to god save the queen only is god the only one allowed to right click save
01:01:43 You're supposed to god
01:01:46 All right, I was confused by that
01:01:48 I you know i'm just gonna nick and eddie is odd bit and say why do we have to ask god to save the queen?
01:01:53 She's got an army and men with guns
01:01:57 Like god could have a go now the blockchain might be all right
01:02:02 That's just god. God's got guns. She's doing all right
01:02:07 This whole time we thought they were talking about god, but god's actually an acronym for gamers on demand
01:02:11 Like she has her gamer army to rise up
01:02:15 Oh god, we didn't think about they've all been waiting
01:02:18 For her to snap her fingers and the gamers will rise up and uh
01:02:24 What will they do? I don't know they were raised playing the getaways so they'd probably drive really badly
01:02:29 They'd rise up and bring all of their playstation 2 memory cards and they will save the queen
01:02:35 Oh, yeah
01:02:36 Save the queen memory card thing and you have a little queen head in there
01:02:41 That'd be cool. I just think a little 3d model just slowly rotating. Yeah, and then I delete her to just clear room for more metal giz solid photos
01:02:49 Yeah, sorry. Yes, right priorities. Yes queen. Hmm. Do you want to do you want to overwrite this file?
01:02:58 Yes queen
01:03:02 That's the day when we're we have voice voice controlled computers and it's really gotten out of hand
01:03:11 Well, they're looking for the commands. Yes queen. Yeah, we're not we can't we can't say yes, please we have to say that
01:03:19 I pushed into it
01:03:26 Snake yeah, I wanted to ask you a question
01:03:29 I wanted to ask you at some point on this podcast about how you found the pcp
01:03:35 Sure, because I saw because I saw um, I didn't know
01:03:39 I saw you you pledged to the patreon and I was like
01:03:42 Is that the to snaker and then I looked at your and it was it was linked to your page. I was like it is
01:03:47 It's the guy same guy. I know this guy. Love this guy got to get that guy got him
01:03:53 That's where I am. So here he is
01:03:56 So, yeah, how'd you how'd you find this? So it's a long and winding road?
01:04:02 I'm a little bit trepidious and it's kind of spotty, but there's when I was a okay
01:04:07 um, I didn't start watching anime until I was
01:04:11 21 22
01:04:13 God you're so pure so long. I was so pure so long and it fucks you up if you get if you if you hook them too early
01:04:21 It's funny as well because I have a problem with watching films and watching as well
01:04:25 I don't watch them that much and I just thought I'm gonna really see about getting into anime
01:04:30 So I watched 100 shows in a fucking year, which and then I didn't watch much afterwards
01:04:35 I just catch I just catch one or two things a year maybe it was it was the year of anime
01:04:41 Yeah, and that was also I was in university at the time and I was also doing the youtube
01:04:46 I was doing the youtube and I was looking at what other creators were doing and because I just got into anime it was
01:04:51 I watched I watched Trixie and
01:04:55 It's funny because I talked to a lot of people in the essay. I'm not gonna put them thing
01:04:58 I had more respect for what she's doing than most of what most of them
01:05:04 Just wait you cut out for a second. Sorry. It was basically I I
01:05:09 Started watching Trixie just kind of see I looked into any tubers. Oh, sure
01:05:13 I kind of wanted to know what was going on and I've been and you know
01:05:16 I I talked to other game essay creators and I have made to all do game essays and I think
01:05:21 I think even back then I had the highest opinion of
01:05:25 Stuff but it's like I thought it was okay. It was fine. Um, it was like stuff
01:05:30 I could watch and then I
01:05:32 I found the pcp through that essentially because I also needed a lot of podcasts because I was doing
01:05:39 I was doing a practical filmmaking course at university
01:05:43 Which is a lot of a lot of your credits where you literally had to
01:05:47 Go and get work you had to go and approach people and do that and a lot of your
01:05:51 grade in the third year and a lot of it in the second year was influenced by
01:05:55 how many credits did you have and
01:05:58 The minimum was five you had to have five
01:06:00 Rolls it could either be like five rolls on one project if you were mad or like one roll on so many
01:06:06 I ended that year with like 25 credits
01:06:10 Saw a lot of credits
01:06:12 I was I was kind of sneaky about it because I was literally the only person in my class doing
01:06:18 Audio engineering. No one else wanted to do audio engineering. Everyone there wanted to be a director
01:06:22 They wanted to be a writer. Of course
01:06:25 Classic
01:06:26 I was the only person in there who like spent my kind of
01:06:29 University grant on a sound kit on like a boom mic and all that
01:06:34 So I was on trains a lot and I needed a lot of podcasts and yeah, I kind of
01:06:39 I listened to a bit of ps uh pcp and it didn't stick with me then
01:06:43 My most of my memory of it then came years later when I was bloody doing
01:06:48 The evil the evil genius video. I was I kind of got bored of listening to the sound of that game
01:06:53 It's got a great soundtrack. I was just like I need to this is a podcast game now
01:06:58 and yeah, it was it was basically via Trixie and
01:07:02 This is gonna sound really weird and like a lot worse than it is. It wasn't actually until a few months ago
01:07:06 I started actually looking into everyone else in the pcp because like because I don't listen fine
01:07:11 I don't listen to I didn't watch Trixie stuff that much anyway. It was like her stuff was
01:07:17 fine, but it was
01:07:19 How do I put this?
01:07:20 Because I don't want to be doing something with it
01:07:23 It's the perfect stuff that I can listen to it when I'm working because it's just mentally engaging enough
01:07:29 Sure, yeah
01:07:31 If I listen to something way too interesting, it's like I have to stop and pay attention
01:07:35 If it's not interesting enough that part of my brain isn't shut up that demands to be entertained and fed
01:07:44 So yeah, it's kind of like I've bounced I've bounced in and out over the years essentially
01:07:50 Well, I uh, I found I think I found your
01:07:54 Evo video because I had played that game and like I didn't know anyone else who I just I saw it recommended one day
01:08:02 Uh, and I just thought that was needs. I was like, oh
01:08:05 There's I played that game like a once and nobody ever talks about it
01:08:09 Yeah, so I checked that out
01:08:10 And then I think a later on I think after I saw
01:08:14 The running shine yick video your yick video got recommended and I was like, oh, it's that guy. It's the same. Oh, it's the same guy
01:08:21 Let me check out his other videos and I've watched a lot of your videos even though I don't play
01:08:26 any of the games you talk about I get that a lot because
01:08:31 My mission statement has changed a lot over the years and at one point and I do still kind of hold to it
01:08:36 Is I want to do these kind of long form deep dives on games that would otherwise
01:08:41 Probably not get this treatment
01:08:43 I break out something big occasionally
01:08:46 Because really I just kind of at heart of it. It's just pursuing what I find interesting
01:08:51 but
01:08:53 Stuff that's got less eyes on it. I'm just kind of drawn to that
01:08:58 But ding ding
01:09:00 What was that? I oh
01:09:02 Oh, that was my computer for some reason that notification didn't go through my headphones. It's just
01:09:09 Okay
01:09:11 I just got I thought I just got cinema sins dinged for something. Yeah
01:09:14 Oh my god, no, that's the mac text message sound
01:09:18 Tom's nft is just minted. It was oh, you know, I've been working on it hard
01:09:23 You know, I figured if I'm gonna make a big video dunking on nft
01:09:25 The best thing to do would be to immediately launch one of my own
01:09:29 It's like it's like it's like ironic, you know satire. Yeah. Yeah. I want to ironically get like 10 ethereum. It'll be good
01:09:38 Yeah, um
01:09:39 It was funny actually the year I did evo and yeek because that was in the same year
01:09:44 A lot of games I did that year. I was picking as excuses to
01:09:48 Again, there it is again. Tom. You're a madman. I can't stop it. I can't stop it every every time snake lies
01:09:56 it goes ding
01:09:58 No, come on. It hasn't been enough for that
01:10:03 Okay, I'm good. Um, it's
01:10:06 That year I was like I did the video on um, we the revolution I did that
01:10:09 I was just kind of picking games that gave me an excuse to research external stuff
01:10:14 Oh god, tom, please. I'm trying to mute it. I'm trying. I can't do it
01:10:19 How could you not mute? I I don't know
01:10:22 I don't know what angels you use
01:10:25 I can't put the spoon. You got to flip it turnways
01:10:29 You got to tip the take the volumes the volume knob and you got to flip it turnways
01:10:35 Or not we could just keep dinging. Yeah, I'm fine with that. Yeah, we'll just pretend citizens is joining us
01:10:40 I'm so sorry for that
01:10:42 All right, I'm turning off playing sound effects. I don't know how to actually switch the fucking thing over
01:10:48 Hey, that's my name in my series
01:10:50 Huh playing. I don't know why I settled on that name. I think it was a real friday afternoon decision
01:10:57 Hey, it works. It's not taken. Yeah
01:10:59 Playing a game
01:11:00 Playing a game and I feel it it was kind of like um, it gave it a sort of relaxed vibe because it's the kind of
01:11:07 Even my try and go as deep as I want to on them
01:11:10 I think it's it's meant to be something like a guided tour of whatever I'm playing and you know
01:11:15 What what experience did I have along the way? What did I learn? What did I find out and what can I pick into with it?
01:11:23 And that was with evo was fun because I like genuinely in the course of making the video
01:11:28 I discovered the other one existed and yeah, I got it gave me an excuse to read up on you know
01:11:34 Ancient creatures and all that and I have a friend who's really into paleons paleontology
01:11:39 So that was fun
01:11:40 I got to speak to her a lot about that and she gave me to yeah
01:11:44 And I learned enough to make a bunch of really bad puns at least about creatures
01:11:50 I I guess I won't specify
01:11:53 Because I guess it's sort of I don't know I don't know if you can spoil like a like a review
01:11:58 If you want to it depends I don't mind it being spoiled because I spoil
01:12:01 I won't I won't I won't because that I like that video and the way the way that the other game ends is really
01:12:08 Cool and it's like makes for like a cool the the ending of that game makes for a cool ending to the video as well
01:12:16 Yeah, I I do think um a lot of my videos
01:12:21 I feel very blessed in terms of um, what's the word for happy coincidences serendipity? I feel
01:12:28 A lot of my videos just kind of come along
01:12:30 There's a I'm always making a video and there is a point where I will learn something or a friend will say something
01:12:35 and then it's just very serendipitous and it all kind of pans out and with the
01:12:40 With the uh evo video there were two of those which was discovering the original game existed and it just
01:12:46 Even though it's the earlier game it ramps up in such a nice way that I could put it second and just have a lot of fun
01:12:52 with the better ending and comparing it back
01:12:55 And uh working backwards to peppering jokes and like call forwards
01:13:01 And it was also me and a friend are just the same friend who really likes paleontology and that
01:13:06 We just finished the table. Tom. I got I got I got it. I gotta stop you. Tom
01:13:11 Your typing is he's mincing. He's mincing so loud. Why?
01:13:16 I hate everything. I don't I don't know if there's any way that you can we maybe get this this typing situation under control
01:13:24 Can we brain it? I'll just type on my phone then
01:13:27 Okay, I have I have a real life thing happening right now. It's okay. It's okay. I'm gonna multitask
01:13:33 I'm rocking up. I'm rocking up. Eleazar cut this all out
01:13:36 No, Eleazar keep it all in make me feel like an idiot duplicate it Eleazar just whatever you think
01:13:43 Base boost his typing
01:13:45 Whatever you think makes for the best listening if it like syncs up cool to like the the the the speech then do that
01:13:51 Otherwise, you know have fun have fun, buddy
01:13:56 It's like a it's like a drum drum roll for the speech but
01:14:00 The second bit of serendipity was I was I think I was part way through recording
01:14:06 Or I maybe hadn't just started. I can't remember these like Dave. I just finished
01:14:09 I was probably through recording the second game and me and a friend had just finished a tabletop session
01:14:13 And she said to me
01:14:14 Hey, have you ever heard of spirit science?
01:14:17 Yeah
01:14:19 And
01:14:20 Showed me we used to have a video about that on our channel. I didn't see I didn't see munchies pcp lecture until afterwards
01:14:28 It's gone now
01:14:29 Although it is still around it's still around on the internet in places, but we saw far channel
01:14:37 But okay, and just anyway. Yeah, so so so we so we know about spirit science is what i'm saying
01:14:44 Yeah, I don't I probably do not know as much as you I like watch that video
01:14:47 And I I studied bits and I studied bits and pieces and just saw the correlations and
01:14:52 I I'm it was a fun coincidence. I may have like with a year of reflection of thing
01:14:56 It's the motifs of spirit science are repeated in a lot of
01:15:00 new age shams
01:15:02 um, yeah
01:15:04 It was a fun coincidence to be able to kind of dig into and just peppering that little bit of the video
01:15:10 I mean, it's it's it's more it's even though like a lot of that stuff is not unique to spirit science
01:15:16 It's more fun to talk about spirit science in specific because everyone knows it and it's this
01:15:22 particularly wacky yeah like a iteration of that sort of new agey
01:15:27 Uh belief system. It's the potpourri
01:15:31 Soup mix grind ground up everything's in here
01:15:34 Yeah
01:15:36 Yes, and also the fact that it's presented through a fucking extra credit squeaky guy youtube animated puppet man
01:15:43 That is the most surreal part of it is that yeah, it's like why is this the form that?
01:15:49 Yeah, putting a weirdly innocent squeaky face on it
01:15:55 I don't know very very strange decision for like how you want to spread the word of your weird
01:16:01 I do think it's kind of like the people who you know the the alt-right pipe line of people who do like friend like that creepy
01:16:08 cutesy like we're friend is like
01:16:11 just
01:16:13 It could be like just making it
01:16:14 You know defanging it out the gate to make it more presentable to some people. I don't know that's just like my
01:16:21 my way of like it's I mean it sounds like like sinister or is it just
01:16:25 Well, there is there is a question. There is a little bit of anti-semitism mixed in there as the
01:16:30 It's it's it's a bit like it's that video is definitely
01:16:35 Like those youtube videos are definitely meant to put like a friendly approachable face on like whatever the fuck this is
01:16:42 They don't they don't say anything
01:16:44 They don't in those videos. Yeah, they don't say anything bad about the Hebrews
01:16:47 But the Hebrews are singled out as a particular group of aliens that has a
01:16:53 That has an outsized like influence on like the course of
01:16:56 Of human history. So like the door is open for something
01:17:03 My thought is is is like i'm not sure whether it was
01:17:08 like
01:17:09 The the the the presentation was made cutesy for reasons of covering up
01:17:15 What would be otherwise sinister language? I feel like the person who made that just likes that
01:17:20 It could be they saw extra credits once and I was like, oh, I want to do that
01:17:23 But with my thing it's tricky to it's tricky to discern intent
01:17:28 Because essentially well, here's the thing. You know why like Nigerian email scams are poorly written
01:17:34 It's essentially that they know they're poorly written. They don't want anyone who can suss that out
01:17:39 They want the people they don't care if it's a smaller sample base. They want the people who will fall for the fall for the thing
01:17:45 That's why they're very upfront with you know being poorly written because they don't want anyone who I just I'm just repeating myself
01:17:51 You know the uh, you you might you might as well. You might as well
01:17:54 You might as well filter out the people who are going to be like suspicious
01:17:58 Essentially, yes, so you make yourself look as stupid as possible so that you'll only get the punters who are easily fooled by it
01:18:07 That's a funny that's a funny way to think about it
01:18:10 Like they just made it just made it down on purpose
01:18:13 I heard that on like a scam baiting channel, but it makes a degree of sense and that
01:18:17 Yeah, why wouldn't you want to filter out the people who are going to be difficult?
01:18:21 Yes, yeah, I think so. I think so
01:18:25 um
01:18:27 It is a
01:18:28 It is a
01:18:29 I think I watched that entire video. It's like many hours long right the spirit science one
01:18:34 Isn't it like six hours like the like the full human history one is like huge
01:18:39 Yeah, I think the one I watched was only about an hour and a half
01:18:42 I get a series right I got the easy right it is part of a series and I
01:18:48 I jumped and I bounced between them trying to
01:18:52 I was trying to grasp a
01:18:55 Uh, I was trying to grasp what could be the
01:18:59 The synopses of this and it's
01:19:02 Hard to pin down especially with you know the person who who made it and it's a
01:19:07 It's a blurry road backwards
01:19:12 God, I'm trying to remember the name of the guy because it because it was inspired by some old grifter in the 70s who
01:19:19 Kicked it off with some something by another name
01:19:22 It's been it's been a couple years in the video and my specific deals. Yeah, that's the tragedy of
01:19:28 Like the year I made those videos was as an excuse to learn a bunch of stuff and then my own
01:19:33 Confounded memory made me forget a lot of it
01:19:37 I am finding it funny though because now I'm thinking about the fact that I did the weed a revolution video
01:19:41 And munchy also did the french revolution which I did catch and was very right
01:19:47 That's right
01:19:50 I think it's a real that's a really interesting game
01:19:53 Yeah, it was fascinating
01:19:55 It's I feel bad for I have I have seen that one. I feel bad for a friend of mine because the first time I played
01:20:00 I had a mate round and
01:20:02 I think this is old let's play a brain of just I regret not recording us playing that game
01:20:08 Because we had like some it would have been good banter. Yeah, and then I felt weirdly cynical about that afterwards
01:20:17 The the you you review games that I've like never even heard of and I never would hear of
01:20:23 Ever I think tech like when when be on on as it flame chase ma
01:20:29 flesh flesh
01:20:30 Chasmer, yeah, or chase chase ma as I like to call it
01:20:35 Oh, yeah
01:20:36 Well, that's that's just one I I've never heard of like neuro or whatever
01:20:42 Yeah, that one I got from youtube pms when they existed. I did not find one by myself
01:20:49 Uh, what's what's uh, I don't know. I guess like what's uh, what what's in a game that makes you want to
01:20:56 Be like I want to talk about this game like what is it about the games you pick that are like this is like
01:21:01 Why do you pick the games you pick? I guess when I figure that one out? I'll tell you
01:21:07 Okay
01:21:08 It really is just
01:21:11 I I said before we started recording proper that because we kind of briefly touched on it, but I'm
01:21:17 This is the first time in
01:21:19 Years that I've had anything approaching a planned ahead schedule and it's just four videos
01:21:24 But usually yeah, I will finish the video and I'll just kind of look around and I'll just think
01:21:28 What do I want to do right now?
01:21:29 And sometimes it'll sneak up on me sometimes
01:21:31 I will just kind of pick something at random and then decide I'm gonna make this interesting
01:21:36 It's gonna be it's like a challenge myself
01:21:38 Sometimes another category that the well is drying but narc the one I'm doing next is one of those games
01:21:43 What's the game that I played as a child and it's just kind of in the recesses of my memory
01:21:48 but I never finished it because
01:21:51 When I was a kid I had fucking weird taste and I would buy the strangest things and then just
01:21:57 Never finished them and I'd come back to them years later because
01:22:00 I bought I wound up buying a lot of russian jank as a kid because those games were always trying
01:22:04 Because I wanted games that promised a lot of freedom and a lot of mechanics
01:22:08 Even when in the early 2000s
01:22:11 The the the trade for that was going to be the mechanics are going to be a little bit
01:22:16 Not half baked just kind of not all the way there. I guess that's a distinction about difference
01:22:21 But you know, but that just kind of led me into I'd see a game like boiling point in the back of the box thing
01:22:25 Was look how big this world is and you can drive anywhere and do immersive stuff and it's like
01:22:30 That sounded cool as hell to me. I like the freedom of it
01:22:33 Or like gangline manager on gang and things like that. It's like, okay. Yeah, I I need to own this
01:22:39 Gangland is a weird one. Yeah
01:22:41 Watch watching you play that one in that video. I'm just I'm looking at that. I'm like
01:22:46 I don't know who would make a game like this. I don't I don't I don't get it medium monsters would
01:22:52 um, I guess so I I am kind of sad genuinely that the
01:22:56 The italian crime family the mafia crime family
01:23:00 Genre isn't as big as it could be
01:23:04 It's
01:23:05 It could be a really fun simulation. I think but I guess it's really tricky because there are a lot of things
01:23:10 You'd have to account for account for and it's a very different rhythm
01:23:15 But the last game that we got in that vein was um, empire of sin, which was
01:23:21 made by George Romero and his wife
01:23:23 John Romero, right?
01:23:25 John Romero. Yeah, that bad. Yeah, John. George Romero is the horror. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas John Romero is the uh
01:23:35 Is the guy who's made you his bitch
01:23:37 Yeah, right. Yeah, I think he just did now because of that slip-up. I think he
01:23:42 Being beaten down right now
01:23:44 Um, right
01:23:45 But and that game
01:23:47 I want to love it because I I kind of want games like this even though I
01:23:51 As a kid I wasn't too big into gang stuff
01:23:53 But now it's like I'd love a good simulation hat, but it's just very boring
01:23:57 It's very artfully put together. It pays a lot of homage to the gangsters of the time
01:24:01 It has the rope-iest Irish accent. I've ever heard in a game. I can't ropey
01:24:07 I see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
01:24:10 But it's uh, it's not doing it. It's it's just not there. I don't know
01:24:14 Do they just they just haven't done the genre justice yet? I guess
01:24:18 It's the problem is trying to figure out the fun in running a crime family because it's
01:24:22 I guess on the surface of it. It'd be very slow very meticulous. There'd be a lot of rules of respects
01:24:26 What is ometta?
01:24:28 Not the game the literal code of honor, but you know, you know, how do you finally game by that?
01:24:34 That episode of the simpsons
01:24:37 I don't even remember what episode it is, but there's a little joke where martin prince
01:24:41 He's playing he got a new video game, but it's the uh, it's the like game version of uh,
01:24:46 My dinner with andre. Oh, yeah
01:24:48 He's playing that in the arcade. Tell me more. Yeah, the the the three the three. Yeah, tell me more bon mort
01:24:54 Like bon appetit
01:24:58 That's good. Yeah, I think it would be really hard to find the fun on that and
01:25:03 How much of a big audience would you have of people who really want an in-depth?
01:25:08 Mafia simulation where yeah, you might have to go to a meet and pay respects and work your way up
01:25:13 If I can surgeon simulate the physics trying to spin the spaghetti around your fork
01:25:19 Oh, yeah, bring that to your mouth. Don't let any of it get on you or you just lose respect
01:25:23 Don't don't let any don't let any source splash on the eye of your of your business partner
01:25:29 Because then you'll get mad and you'll get a gun out. There's a soprano's uh video game for ps2, right?
01:25:34 Is that any yeah road to respect it takes place between between seasons three and four or two and three and was based on a
01:25:41 Storyline that got dropped from the show
01:25:44 I wouldn't have that has anyone played that one. How does that one play? Is it just like a generic?
01:25:48 I think only cybershell has played that game. Oh really cybershell the biggest soprano's man. He's a soprano's guy
01:25:56 Um, I'm working my way through sopranos and I did I was on a stream the other day where I realized and I've still never seen it
01:26:02 I was on a I was on a stream the other day where I realized and joked I should play that game when it's canonically accurate to the
01:26:09 To the series
01:26:10 It's like oh, well that was a great season. Just boot up your playstation too
01:26:14 Just oh god. Oh, I really took a dive here. I need Tony's full story
01:26:21 I like ps2 tie-in games to media franchises because it's like the the the area where they're just about getting
01:26:29 photorealistic faces, but not like good
01:26:32 They're just being able to like put a png of an actor's face onto a model
01:26:36 And you just like okay, I can recognize who that is
01:26:40 But it looks like shit
01:26:41 Um, but that's the fun exactly ever there's like a 24 game. I played where it's like jack bowell's face
01:26:48 But the gameplay was godawful. Have you just flying all over the place and getting shot
01:26:53 It's like when you play the funniest one is uh the lord of the rings game
01:26:56 Like the two towers or ps2 where they'd like shift from the movie and then try and recreate the frame in ps2
01:27:02 And like back in the day is like whoa now you look at it. It's like
01:27:05 Oh
01:27:06 The I mean you could tell there was a difference back in the day, but it really just was oh my god
01:27:11 I'm used to playstation one exactly so incredible and uh, I think I think tech's trying to access something
01:27:16 It's it's it's okay. It's okay. I just don't want to talk over people. You know it is uh, no you got you got a battle for dominance
01:27:22 Is how I know there's a it is that's how we do it. Have you ever played have any of you ever played enter the matrix?
01:27:29 Yes, yes
01:27:31 That game multiple times as a kid xbox. All right. So yeah, I'm playing through it right now for reps to gog, right?
01:27:38 And um, yes
01:27:39 So the thing is the thing with enter the matrix is that it's a tie-in game to the movies, right?
01:27:44 But it's it's 100 canon and they got like act they filmed actual footage
01:27:50 Of the actors from the movies for the game. So there's like there's live action cutscenes for the games
01:27:55 I'll really fucking dark by the way
01:27:58 And then it'll switch it'll switch to the in-game models that look like shit, but um
01:28:03 It's it's like the apex predator of of movie tie-in games because it gives you like crucial plot information that you won't get in the
01:28:11 Yeah, it's reloaded. Like I was watching the it's like it's like the kingdom hearts chain
01:28:15 Is it like the kingdom hearts chain of memories of uh, of uh, yeah, it's it's like that
01:28:20 It's like that like level of crackheadedness, but for like a matrix video game
01:28:26 And it's like 45 minutes of new film scenes or something crazy like like
01:28:31 It's like you don't play as like nioh or whatever, but they got like kary and moss and shit
01:28:37 For for like yeah, it's like the two side characters that like briefly appear in yeah ghost may have to play on both because they have
01:28:44 slightly different stories
01:28:46 Yeah, I was I was trying to see if I could get away with just playing as ghosts
01:28:50 But I think I'm gonna have to I'm gonna play as nao. We just uh
01:28:53 Just to say I did it wouldn't be it wouldn't be right. I thought fucking having the uh, this
01:28:59 Rise of Skywalker event in fortnight was bad back in the day
01:29:03 We had 45 minutes of an entire movie in a shitty video game
01:29:07 Yeah, I mean you you'd be watching uh, the matrix reloaded and you wouldn't know you wouldn't know how uh, naobie got the uh
01:29:15 Got the oh my god. What the fuck was the name of that stupid ship from uh, that like
01:29:21 Nebuchadnezzar not the nebuchadnezzar or the logo so the the ship that gets like destroyed in one of the animatrix, uh
01:29:28 Movies that is basically delivering
01:29:32 Was it was it was it called the was it called the sargon of a cod?
01:29:36 You know, it should be it should bend that joke
01:29:43 Wait, I wait no, do I have like a foggy memory that like there is a ship called that it's somewhere in the I don't think
01:29:51 It's within the theme. Yeah, it would it would there would be okay. It makes sense. But yeah, there's like a
01:29:58 They like get they get like some message like a distress signal or whatever from a ship that's supposed to alert zion
01:30:05 That the machines are have found their location. They're attacking them
01:30:08 And that's like the whole impetus of like the matrix revolutions
01:30:11 But they don't tell you any of that in the movie the only reason I figured that out was because I happened to watch the animatrix
01:30:17 Another tie-in that is tech that is cannon
01:30:21 Oh, man, it's cool
01:30:23 I think I watched the animatrix and I don't remember anything. It's really good at all
01:30:27 I remember the one like main story that goes through it of like how actually the machines got kind of fucked and humans
01:30:34 So I was like, you know what that's some really second renaissance
01:30:37 Yeah, my 13 year old brain is down with this shit
01:30:40 Mmm
01:30:43 It's like society. It's genuinely cool. Even if um, that's a dangerous word even if reloaded and revolutions like kind of suck but
01:30:51 Uh, the world and like the the lore and the the world building and stuff are like really really
01:30:57 Uh, interesting in the matrix
01:30:59 I'm not I'm not gonna spoil it. But um, who here has played uh, path of neo
01:31:04 I've not played that I want to I heard it like when it came out
01:31:08 I heard it was like actually pretty good and everyone's like, oh, this is way better than enter the matrix actually
01:31:12 That's what I heard too. I'm looking forward to it
01:31:15 What is path of neo?
01:31:17 It's like I think it's a game that just follows the movie story
01:31:20 It's like and you play as neo and you fucking beat the shit out of dudes, right?
01:31:23 Oh, yeah, it's the whole trilogy that kind of condensed into a video game and it's a decently fun, uh, brawler
01:31:30 And I was gonna and I don't know if I'm not gonna spoil but now I'm not even gonna do my very light
01:31:34 Nudge and wink spoiler if I now I know someone wants to play
01:31:38 Yeah, I
01:31:40 It goes places. I was gonna see how much that game costs on ebay for xbox right now
01:31:45 Uh, it I got it. I got it on ps2. I like a local game store for like 15 bucks. It's not
01:31:51 Uh, that expensive. Oh, sorry. They're 14 dollars. I got it for 14 bucks
01:31:57 14 dollars for xbox. That's not bad
01:32:00 Maybe I'll buy one
01:32:02 I will say my one weird bit of matrix game trivia that is like not really a spoiler
01:32:07 But also just kind of viscs. It's funny. There was a matrix mmo that was also canon and orpheus dies in it
01:32:15 Yep, there was a matrix mmo. It was it was
01:32:19 It's you know what you know what?
01:32:21 That's pretty cool. Actually. It's like, yeah a matrix mmo would be canon
01:32:26 Uh, and matrix was an mmo. Yeah, like movie. Yeah, that seems really thematically like and good
01:32:32 I have a disc copy of it. You can't play it anymore, but I I had the matrix online
01:32:38 Um
01:32:40 Awesome. I didn't play many. Awesome kid. I had I had that one
01:32:45 You know what better than wow? I said
01:32:50 Let's go
01:32:53 Uh, hmm, I I bounced off of final fantasy 11
01:32:57 After a while and that was about it. I uh, it's all about final fantasy 14 now
01:33:02 I had star wars galaxies, which was way too complex for me. You know who messaged me
01:33:08 You know who DM'd me on twitter the other day?
01:33:11 After after getting embroiled in another argument with one of these weirdos who insists that there's nothing political about the plot of one piece
01:33:18 In which the literal final bed the literal ultimate antagonist is the government
01:33:24 um
01:33:25 one of
01:33:27 None other than maryweather
01:33:29 Popped into to weigh in a little bit on that and then he he DM'd me
01:33:34 Afterwards to tell me that I should really play final fantasy 14
01:33:37 Because it's cool and good and it's got a free trial up to level 60, but that's what he said
01:33:43 He all he he didn't say the exact copypasta, but he I mean he delivered all the all the basic information
01:33:52 Contained there and I have my husband is playing final fantasy 14 literally right now in the other rooms. Oh, they managed to
01:33:58 sound
01:34:00 I yeah, they've been able to do it
01:34:03 I uh, I had my group's tabletop session cancelled this week because of ff 14. So I hate that damn game
01:34:12 No
01:34:14 Bullshit, it's bullshit. That's un that's unacceptable. We have to hold no
01:34:18 It's your fault. It's your fault for not joining them in final fantasy 14. I tried. Okay. This is the pettiest damn thing
01:34:24 I'll ever say I'm just not an mmo guy, but I played it for half an hour
01:34:28 And I stopped and I'm gonna admit this is on me. This is just me being a dumbass
01:34:32 I just said I'm sorry mate. I can't do this. I hate how everyone is dressed in this game
01:34:39 That sounds that sounds like uh like one of those
01:34:43 Iroly things that like whenever someone says that the designs in final fantasy 10 are dumb. I just get mad
01:34:50 You know, I like how people are you talking about the npcs? Are you talking about the uh the player character?
01:34:56 I hated everyone
01:34:57 I walked into a room and a lot of fells started getting sassy with me and I'm like
01:35:02 I don't feel like this
01:35:07 It was entirely petty I was not an mmo guy
01:35:11 Yeah, it wasn't not my jam. So but I've been taking the piss out of a friend for liking ff 14
01:35:16 Just for the sake of it for years and you know what that was ammo
01:35:21 Good my stupidity and pettiness is ammo. I mean it's it's not that petty because like i'm an mmo
01:35:28 You play for hours if you don't like the look of your character
01:35:32 The hell's the point in being there? I suppose but no, it's just i'm just saying you know my dislike of it is
01:35:37 Serious, it's just an ongoing bit for years that has become steadily more internalized
01:35:44 People make fun of me for liking water warcraft
01:35:47 Uh because of the giant shoulder pads and no other. Well, I like the giant shoulder pads
01:35:52 I want them to be even bigger actually. No, it's silly. They think they're so cool
01:35:57 Just like dragon balls you with all the spiky hair. They're dumb
01:36:00 They're not cooler than me think of think of all the storage you could put in those giant shoulder pads
01:36:05 Why why the why isn't it there like five stuff where containers where they're organs built into each one?
01:36:11 Where are the pockets? I
01:36:14 Look seeing a world of warcraft guy with huge shoulders oof her poor bag
01:36:24 I'm just thinking does that guy have any cartilage left in his knees. That's too heavy. No
01:36:30 No, he's just very strong. He's so fucking strong
01:36:34 Look, I don't play video games. I don't he's got a sword the size of the earth
01:36:40 I've just been sitting here. I've just been sitting here gathering gathering of stuff for my topic
01:36:45 Yeah, because I've had since since the month started 1st of december
01:36:49 Shit happened and every day there's been some crazy shit happening to me most of it bad
01:36:55 Um, so to start with I don't have it. I lost my job
01:36:59 And it's not like
01:37:01 Oh, I don't get to go to McDonald's anymore like go whatever the fuck no
01:37:05 My job was working for pencil mation one of the largest animation channels. I was gonna ask if that's the job you were talking about
01:37:11 Yeah, what happens they have
01:37:13 All right, so for people who don't know pencil mation
01:37:16 Is like a animation series about a stick man who walks around on a piece of paper and there's a pencil that draws things
01:37:22 And he interacts with it. Wait, wait, sorry, uh, is my is my cameo still gonna make it in
01:37:27 Yes, I was gonna get to that
01:37:33 So I I watched the first episode of pencil mation
01:37:37 In 2007 I was a little boy and I made a fan of your job. I just wanted to see my face in the show
01:37:42 I'll get to it. You gotta be patient then I can't I can't I have tell you this story
01:37:48 I'll kill you wait. I said I have a lot of patience before so I gotta I gotta do that
01:37:53 Okay, well anyways in 2007 I saw it and I was a fan of it and I made like a little fan animation
01:38:00 Back fan that I still have and I forgot about it for years
01:38:03 And then in 2016, you know, like or no 2017 2018 like 11 years later
01:38:10 I got a message from tr or y the famous my little pony porn animator
01:38:14 I'm saying that they wanted to hire him as a director, but he didn't feel like it
01:38:19 So he was just telling other people he knew like who did animation if I'd be interested and I said, oh sure
01:38:23 And then I realized I got the job and I realized afterwards it was a thing. I was a fan of as a kid and that was cool
01:38:29 um
01:38:30 Well, the reason I got laid off is because a lot of people got laid off a lot of people
01:38:35 Um, are they downsizing?
01:38:38 Yeah, okay, so kind of funny. Um, I looked up pencil mation so I could grab screenshots of all the cameos I've put in for pcp things
01:38:46 Because now what I'm no longer working there. I no longer care if people know what I did that. I used to be very secretive about it
01:38:52 Funny thing is I looked them up and the two results I see are at the end of pencil mation and a graph going down
01:38:58 Basically, what's happened is the youtube for kids
01:39:03 designation has completely screwed them over
01:39:06 Instead of getting like 10 to 20 to 30 million views per video putting out free videos a week
01:39:13 They are now getting like 50k views
01:39:16 Whoa, okay, because of an out an algorithm change
01:39:20 Well, okay, so
01:39:23 You as four kids it was the four kids destroys your ads and fuss your search ability
01:39:28 Right
01:39:29 It's it's a bit more complex than that. So originally, um, only like one or two videos were getting flagged like every couple months
01:39:36 They weren't getting flagged that much
01:39:38 And they managed to avoid the four kids thing by saying no animations for everyone, you know
01:39:42 It's not just a baby thing even though
01:39:45 There to be fair it was mostly kids watching their stuff
01:39:47 But like they were trying to like avoid it because they didn't want their ad revenue getting cut down to like 10 20% of what it was
01:39:53 The problem is is because most of our audience were genuinely kids and the episodes were not appearing on the kids app
01:39:59 Where it was getting used more and more. Um, their viewership
01:40:03 Um was starting to go down. Um instead of getting like regularly like 20 million views a video
01:40:08 They were getting like one or two million which is still good
01:40:11 But like for how big the team was they they were like just scraping by
01:40:15 so
01:40:16 They noticed on a couple of the videos that had been automatically flipped to four kids
01:40:21 They had a resurgence in views shortly afterwards like we're they're getting 10 20 times the viewer count
01:40:26 So even with the loss in it like ad revenue like, you know percentage
01:40:31 The added views were going to add up to more money
01:40:33 So they thought maybe we just need to bite the bullet and switch everything
01:40:36 And they did about a month or two ago
01:40:38 And it worked for a while as in flagging it for kids
01:40:42 Yeah, they they intentionally flagged for stuff for kids. If you do it intentionally you can switch it back anytime
01:40:46 It's only when youtube does it that it's permanent
01:40:49 So if I get it did that as an experiment it worked for a bit and then
01:40:52 Suddenly like a flitch a flitch a switch was a flitch a flitch swept. Yeah
01:40:57 Like internally somewhere at pencil mation, um at youtube. Sorry and just overnight it just went to nothing
01:41:05 And I've seen this happen before it happened to my old channel nightfall studios
01:41:09 Why did that happen though?
01:41:12 According to
01:41:14 Ross who again, he has like fucking crazy. You mean you mean of game brumps?
01:41:19 No, no of uh chris farms. No ross ballinger
01:41:24 Of pencil mation. He's a cool guy. Oh, okay. He was he was gonna fucking just two russes in animation. I can't believe it
01:41:30 Impossible impossible. He's not even made of rubber. What the fuck how did that happen? But
01:41:37 According to him the algorithm
01:41:39 Oh, I got it. No, I got it. I got it
01:41:41 Rip rip to the podcast
01:41:44 It's uh, I'm sorry
01:41:46 What he's what he's heard from his deep state connections at youtube is the algorithm has like a good video switch and a bad video switch
01:41:53 Or maybe a good channel switch and a bad channel switch
01:41:55 It'll just decide channel bad and just fuck them over this happened to one of my old channels
01:42:01 I don't use it anymore. Um, but we had a video on there that was yeah nightfall studios
01:42:06 We had a video called a cult classic. It was a my little pony animation. I did
01:42:11 um
01:42:12 Which is probably one of the probably the best video I made it used to get about 20 000 views a day consistently for years
01:42:19 And then like instantly in a single day a day pretty much
01:42:23 um
01:42:24 And then instantly it dropped to like
01:42:27 50 views a day like
01:42:30 Like instantaneously because youtube said video bad flip the switch
01:42:35 I think apparently internally apparently that's how it works at the time
01:42:37 I didn't know what it was. I thought like they just decided to blacklist it or something
01:42:41 It's a thing that can just happen to channel sometimes
01:42:44 And it happened to them and so they had to
01:42:48 They they were just like fuck we we have to scale back and so pretty much everyone was like go
01:42:53 I I'm not I'm not worried. I got good severance pay. I'm gonna be fine. Like we have
01:42:57 Enough in savings to coast by for like a year. So I'm just gonna be working on my patreon and stuff
01:43:02 Um, and I'll probably end up making a lot more money by the end of next year. So it'll I honestly with
01:43:07 It's good. I'm kind of glad it happened. That's what Trixie said and look what happened there
01:43:12 I was oh, yeah, but I'm I'm smart of in Trixie though. It'll be I'll be fine
01:43:17 I'm privating all of my porn drawings in three weeks
01:43:21 Save me now
01:43:23 Now's the time for me to make my porn drawings even more public because I don't have to worry about it being associated with me
01:43:29 You're working for a channel that does kids entertainment
01:43:32 Um, anyways, so I'm gonna I'm gonna show some of the cameos I've done
01:43:36 Uh, this episode, uh on on this frame. There's like there's a give and take drop face. It's very hard to see
01:43:43 It's at like one percent opacity
01:43:46 I have a dark inversion. You can sort of make it out. It's like
01:43:50 Oh, yeah, it's big if I have to like lean my head way back and I can sort of see it
01:43:55 Yeah, um, there's another one in this episode for one frame and uh, there was like a cloud smoke cloud
01:44:02 I put one in the corner
01:44:05 I put a number one on a painting at the end of this episode
01:44:10 They're all in the background
01:44:13 Dude, I fucking love the bra. I fucking love the bra
01:44:16 When when Gib drop that video years ago, I thought it was the best video ever and like all the comments were
01:44:21 Oh my god, you you lazy. Why are you making such a lazy review of my little pony?
01:44:28 With like jesse
01:44:30 No, no, no, this is when I was starting to be like, uh, jeez making a video every week sucks. I don't like it's boring
01:44:36 I'm just talking about pony show every time. So I started to fuck things up. I I decided to draw my pony
01:44:43 uh, like
01:44:45 avatar really really badly in ms paint
01:44:48 And bruhp was just one of the drawings, but there was a bunch of them. Oh, yeah
01:44:52 Explain the plot and I talked in a silly voice
01:44:56 That was a good video. I remember that it was episode with the I don't remember it was the one of rarity getting the green
01:45:03 evil thing whatever the hook
01:45:06 The evil the evil jewel or whatever
01:45:09 She got like the the evil
01:45:11 Book that gave her like green magic and she was doing a bad thing. I don't know. I love that video
01:45:16 I love I thought it was the funniest thing and everyone was like hating on it at the time
01:45:20 So I and I always like fuck you bruhp is good. You guys are shit. So I have a I have an emotional connection to it
01:45:27 Um, but I didn't do any cameos for a while because I was working too hard. Um, the workload got crazy in 2019
01:45:34 You'll notice in the first two videos. It's just like very simple. No backgrounds. It's just a blank
01:45:39 Paper texture and then in the next one. It's like a full-on painted background with a million characters
01:45:45 Yeah, that was during 2019
01:45:47 They started making the episodes way too fucking ambitious and it was like really hard to keep up
01:45:52 And this episode the one with the Ben st. Cameo where you're shoplifting in a market
01:45:56 Oh, my god, you can look at it's not I don't think the episode's out yet
01:46:01 There he is. I animated that it's just barely it's just barely me
01:46:06 yeah
01:46:07 so
01:46:09 That episode took two years over two years to complete when other episodes take just a few months
01:46:14 Yeah, 2019 like we were way too ambitious when we scaled back
01:46:18 On how complex the episodes were but yeah, that was one of those but yeah in total
01:46:24 97 episodes that are out. I've like directed either entirely or I directed part of them and it's like another
01:46:32 13 or so episodes that are unreleased that'll be finished by the remainder of the team at some point
01:46:37 So like 110 episodes total pretty cool
01:46:41 um
01:46:42 I'm I'm proud of what I've done there and I'm glad to be moving out
01:46:46 But yeah, those those are some of the pzp references. It's possible. There are more that I've forgotten
01:46:50 But I'll let you know if that ever if I ever find them
01:46:56 Literally epic. I was gonna say it's epic. It's not there's no other word for it
01:47:02 Uh, I mean, how many views did you get on the you haven't like millions of views on the uh?
01:47:06 Is it the cum zone video not the one with the with the pcp logo?
01:47:11 Yeah, the cum zone video has like welcome to the cum zone
01:47:15 Yeah, the first one has like 11 million views
01:47:17 Pretty good. Um, the the cuphead animation has like 90 million views that I put all the pcp stuff in
01:47:24 Hold on
01:47:26 All I have to do is search cupheads sort by most popular and it's like the second result on youtube
01:47:31 Spare some views sir, please
01:47:35 91 million views. Yeah
01:47:37 with the
01:47:39 This little hypocrite. Why not a hundred? Yeah
01:47:43 Um, it'll get there. It still gets views pretty quickly
01:47:46 My videos my my lectures, uh, they took a dip. They've been taking a dip by the dip views recently
01:47:54 No, I can't
01:47:55 But they're down. Yeah, they they they are getting less views than they have in like in like years
01:48:00 These past couple months, you know, we had the big bump with the uh when I released sonichi 102
01:48:06 And I thought that would give my channel a boost and for a while it did but no, it's down lower than ever
01:48:10 I'm a bit down. I'm a bit. I'm a bit cheesed about it. It's not good. But that is cheese
01:48:15 I was um, I need to
01:48:18 Animation youtube gets more screwed than anyone else unlike when youtube changes something or other
01:48:24 Yeah, yeah, the only reason pencilmation was able to succeed is because they did reruns
01:48:30 Um, when they uploaded a video like the first five minutes would be a new episode
01:48:35 And then it would be 40 minutes of reruns of old episodes. That's how they got the watch time up
01:48:40 right
01:48:41 That was the only way they were able to succeed which is technically like breaking youtube's rules for like, um
01:48:46 what's it called like
01:48:48 Uploading like re-uploading like the same content over and over
01:48:51 But I guess they were just skirting by on like a technicality. It's technically different content. So they were fine
01:48:56 Oh, yeah gives youtube any respect. They don't respect the people who actually play post there. Yeah, no
01:49:02 I mean, I mean if they were getting away with it
01:49:06 Last time I calculated I I went through and manually added up the view counts of every pencilmation episode
01:49:11 I've done and it was close to a billion views like two years ago. Nice if I'd um
01:49:17 If I included the fact that my episodes appear on reruns
01:49:21 And I have like almost a hundred episodes pretty much every rerun would have something of mine
01:49:25 So I'd be multiple billions of views at this point if I could fucking calculate it somehow
01:49:30 Incalculably high
01:49:32 Yeah, I need I need I need like a tool that I can like just input like a hundred like youtube links and it can just
01:49:38 Spit out the total view count for all of them because he's doing it manually fucking sucks
01:49:42 subconsciously suggested to potential billions
01:49:46 Yeah, and yeah the pvp. Yeah
01:49:49 It's we have to how are we got to flip the switch?
01:49:51 We've got to say the code word to like flip the switch to activate them
01:49:55 in the minds of the masses
01:49:58 Oh a little the little all hail plankton helmet that's being strapped into their head except it's been sainte
01:50:06 Maybe it's me, but does anyone have a feeling like get get get in is getting a step closer to an insanity every video
01:50:12 He makes I mean I still like them, but man
01:50:14 What a shift started as an assembly of different opinions on a particular episode
01:50:17 Then moved into a sort of not so serious review then stuff and now we're here man the pony
01:50:23 The pony youtube
01:50:25 Comments the kind of people who were leaving comments on pony youtube videos were
01:50:31 They were a different they were a different breed simply build
01:50:34 They're the they're the they're the people who analyze the analyzers
01:50:38 That over
01:50:40 Massacre show. So I'm not in I'm not in on brony stuff. I in a brony. I don't know about it, but
01:50:47 This is a fucking thing. I thought it was a joke for the first three years. It was happening. I thought it was an ironic bit
01:50:55 Yeah, definitely started is that right?
01:50:57 It I assumed I assumed it was until until I started finding some of the fan stuff and being like, oh, no
01:51:04 No, this is this is sincere appreciation. I'm seeing okay. All right. It was a weird
01:51:10 What I first thought but I was thinking like
01:51:14 This show I saw was like a youtube poop of it. It was like there's no way this they like this show
01:51:19 I thought it was an ironic thing and also a porn some clips of it
01:51:23 Some clips of it. I was just like, oh, that's cute. Maybe I'll look at it. Maybe I'll see for myself
01:51:28 Biggest mistake in my life. Absolutely. Look look where it's led you here. This cursive play
01:51:35 This is not coming ironically
01:51:41 Huh, if you'd ever what if you I don't want to repeat came on ironic
01:51:52 Well, hey oblivion fall sorry to hear yo that you got fired
01:51:57 Oh gross for gross misconduct
01:52:00 Gross for sex for sexual harassment. I'm sorry here. You got fired for sexual harassment. Anyway moving on to the next
01:52:07 topic of discussion
01:52:09 Yeah, no, that's no, that's a bummer
01:52:12 But the next the next topic is plagiarism. Oh, all right
01:52:17 This guy
01:52:18 I want to I want to talk about something else. Um, that's been happening to my friend recently. She's an artist
01:52:23 She has a she has a character that she uses to represent herself. It's like a hold on. I
01:52:29 Wait, I had a fucking no, I closed the folder. I had it all open a second ago
01:52:33 This situation is really funny. It's not just like, oh, you know, just artist dramas, but it's the fact that
01:52:39 like
01:52:40 People are defending something that is so obviously stupid that I can't wrap my head around so like
01:52:47 Hold on. That's loading up an image
01:52:50 So that's like some drawings like of my friend's character that they did over the years
01:52:55 They're like a black cat
01:52:57 like
01:52:58 spooky monster thing
01:53:00 And they've drawn like probably like close to a hundred images of them
01:53:03 It's like an overcat
01:53:05 Yeah, she's like a cat wolf thing and sort of like hybrid. It's hard. I don't exactly know what she is
01:53:11 It reminds me of uh, that uh, that thing in the um,
01:53:17 This is gonna sound bad the thing in the wall review
01:53:20 Lucy lace maker
01:53:22 Little white rat the nostalgia critic
01:53:27 Fills me with the urge to decapitate
01:53:29 That creature
01:53:30 I'm sorry to think and I will let you go back to I just want to bring up that
01:53:34 The other day because I heard about from me. I watched the nostalgia critic sailor moon review
01:53:39 Which has an extended aside on age of consent laws in japan, which oh, I know
01:53:45 It's true though. Wait, is that a new video or is it?
01:53:49 No, it's a few years old. It's old. It's old. He's like at this age
01:53:53 You can have a blow job, but you can't touch a vagina at this age
01:53:57 You can like he's like he's just going into the technicality for like 10 minutes and I'm like
01:54:02 It's like he's stuck on it and he says one sense and I knew it was coming because like we've been told about me
01:54:08 Everyone was like, okay, doc. You said the thing you can move on now
01:54:11 And then he just keeps fucking going for multiple minutes
01:54:15 okay
01:54:16 And he's like genuinely just like elaborating like the legal system
01:54:20 He's trying to make a genuine point about and then at the end the funniest part the punchline of all this is kind of
01:54:27 It ends on
01:54:28 And that's why when I put sailor moon whatever on my sexiest character's list. I didn't know
01:54:38 It's like, okay, dug that is genuinely the funniest joke you've ever written and you did not mean it that way
01:54:45 Yeah
01:54:48 I'm really sorry twins were up. So he got flak for that back when he made whatever that that list
01:54:54 Oh the sexiest characters. I'm sorry twins right like an actual topic with that
01:54:58 Was he like was he like thinking about this for years like oh god
01:55:01 I've got to have to I'm gonna have to address this somehow. He probably I bet he was I bet he was yeah
01:55:06 It was yeah, no the uh an airing of the grievances was the primary motivator
01:55:11 I guess behind the nostalgia critic sailor moon review because
01:55:15 The rest it was even worse than a usual nostalgia critic review in terms of just airiness and emptiness
01:55:22 Yeah
01:55:23 I mean it sounds like it was worth it though. That's oh, yeah, no we were me and I've watched through every
01:55:29 nostalgia critic film more than once with different friend groups because
01:55:33 Oh film. I thought you were gonna say every review. No, no every review. I'm not like I've watched every nostalgia critic review
01:55:39 No, just the films just just the films and they are I've actually never seen a single one of the films
01:55:45 Uh, they're they're a good drunken with mates watch if you're all in on the bit of how weird and bad nostalgia critic is
01:55:53 I've I've heard a lot about them
01:55:55 But I never watched like I'd never watched uh like uh
01:55:59 Like that guy with the glasses content in its heyday. So I'm not like I wasn't invested in the characters
01:56:06 I just know about them now as like. Oh, yeah that weird
01:56:09 diaspora of people that that all came from
01:56:12 Guy with the glasses like linkara and and uh, Todd in the shadows and Lindsay Ellis and all these people
01:56:17 Every time they're all just mingling every single time juwari always on screen. It's harrowing
01:56:22 You just kind of got to think about it
01:56:24 Like damn there he is. Okay. He he's the guy he committed suicide, but did he also have some like sexual assault
01:56:31 Sexual assault allegations come out after the fact. Yeah
01:56:34 Yeah, I don't know exactly the extent of it, but uh
01:56:39 everyone was
01:56:41 Everyone was like they at first
01:56:43 Suicide obviously everyone was very sad. Yes, and then they learn about that later and they're like, uh
01:56:49 I've got to delete all of my sad things. I said
01:56:53 They couldn't because I love all my loving all my loving tributes to juwario
01:56:58 Yeah, that's why I love lull
01:57:01 lull
01:57:02 Anyway, what were we talking about something? We're talking about the plagiarism thing. I was gonna get into that
01:57:07 Yes
01:57:08 Yeah, so anyway, they've had this character. They've had this character for like a couple years
01:57:13 Um, and one of their artist friends who was a much bigger artist really liked the character
01:57:16 They they were simping they were simping hard. Oh my god. She's so cute. I want to cuddle. I want to sex. She's so great
01:57:22 And my friend, you know told him well
01:57:24 It's too bad. My character is a lesbian lamal and he oh no cry emoji that does make that is very upsetting
01:57:32 It is very upsetting Frank. I don't know what I would do in that situation. Lose lose my mind. I assume this fictional character is a lesbian
01:57:40 Yeah, yeah, so he drew um a lot of fan art
01:57:45 Initially and because he really liked the character and he was really into it
01:57:49 So he drew a bunch of fan art that was really good. He's a really good artist. I think um
01:57:54 And he drew that for like for out 2020 for about a year. He was drawing fan art and that's the images on the left
01:58:01 And all of a sudden he had a new o.c
01:58:06 That he started drawing afterwards
01:58:09 That he claimed. Oh, no, this character is different. This is completely different. This isn't the same character or they look nothing like
01:58:18 And it's they look pretty so they look pretty
01:58:21 On the right. Wait a minute. That's the other one. Wait. Wait. Okay. The one of she's peeking out the wall
01:58:27 That's the same drawing
01:58:29 Yeah, that is the same drawing well spotted then he was literally the same drawing
01:58:33 That that drawing that drawing that's not the same drawing one of them has a speech bubble
01:58:39 Yeah, yeah, you're right. You know, she has a picture
01:58:41 See he insists. Well, well like her personality is different. See my version. She's straight
01:58:47 She's not as tall, you know with all the all these images or there's no background. You can totally tell how tall she is
01:58:53 um
01:58:54 Okay, and like and he insists that there's a bunch of differences
01:58:57 But they're all differences you can't fucking see because they're things that aren't being drawn at the time
01:59:02 Um, and yeah that one image that is identical. He sent that to my friend in 2019
01:59:09 Like as as like a piece of fan art he was working on two months later
01:59:13 Someone wrote a fanfic based on his fan art
01:59:16 where they like
01:59:17 Made them straight and stuff and then the remainder of his art was of
01:59:22 The character from the fanfic of the fan art that he was now
01:59:27 drawing
01:59:28 Fan art of a fanfic of his fan art of my friend's character
01:59:32 And saying it was no longer the same character even though the design was identical
01:59:36 Okay, and he then
01:59:39 A year later
01:59:41 It's confusing
01:59:43 Just just really to get around that lesbian roadblock by any means necessary it seems the any means necessary
01:59:49 He added he basically just yeah, he added a speech bubble to the image post
01:59:52 Posted to his twitter a year later and said it was his character
01:59:55 And so like we tried working things out with him like in dms like saying hey, maybe you could change the design
02:00:01 Maybe you could put stripes in her hair. Maybe give him a hand
02:00:05 Okay, okay, okay. So so the is the is the problem just like
02:00:09 He's basically using the character. He's using the design
02:00:13 But calling it his own character is the idea like
02:00:16 I don't want you using that design because it is so
02:00:20 Like it much it'll be confused for mine
02:00:23 Yeah, and also the fact that he was like using the character for like straight things and my
02:00:28 Friend is lesbian and was uncomfortable with it because it's like a character that represents her
02:00:33 And also they were just friends and she told him like that's an extra degree of discomfort. Yeah, yeah
02:00:38 Maybe I'm being like and for like a year she was asking him to change the design and he was like, oh, yeah
02:00:43 I'll get to it soon. I'll get to it soon. Um, actually, can you like drop it?
02:00:47 Um, uh, like I thought I thought like those just like those damn plebe and the wee blu rays. Oh, I'll get to it soon
02:00:53 Oh, when are we gonna go? Yeah. Oh, I did nobody bought me a burner burner though
02:00:57 You should try sending this guy a blu ray burner. See if that helps any
02:01:01 Yeah, so
02:01:02 Eventually it went dark for four months. Wait. Wait. Was it was snake?
02:01:05 Yeah, it wasn't like a thing. It was like I'm being maybe I'm being maybe a little naive about this
02:01:09 But it was just like
02:01:11 Really love the character and maybe I'm just not key to it on how much it's they're gonna share this thing
02:01:15 But why didn't he just do this for himself?
02:01:17 the character
02:01:19 I don't
02:01:20 I don't really get it. It seems it seems like the motivation on like
02:01:24 Like you can make the odd just why spread it around at that point artists are vain
02:01:30 This can confirm can confirm. Okay, right. Yeah. I'm not in on yeah
02:01:35 I'm just being I'm naively asking. I just it seems like to me if you wanted to like keep this
02:01:41 Going the simplest solution would have been to just be like, you know
02:01:45 Do what the porn artists do and be like your sexual orientation is whatever I feel like in my art and just go hand my
02:01:53 My feeling
02:01:55 Okay, I I'm getting the feeling that this is like what this is really about
02:02:00 Is like a like weird control thing like I want this part like it feels like it's just like crossing the boundary
02:02:06 into like
02:02:07 This is about the artists
02:02:09 If it's because it's because it's because it's because it's because it's her character
02:02:16 If I don't really consider this character, I like effectively becomes what I want it to be because I control this narrative now
02:02:25 I I just I could see that being like a thing because like maybe
02:02:29 They go to this artist. This is maybe they know it's the
02:02:34 representation the artist draws of themselves
02:02:37 And then he says oh, I want to cuddle that or I want to like is it that like
02:02:42 Yeah, it's like a maximally of like
02:02:45 The affection for the creator
02:02:47 Because that that takes it to a level of
02:02:50 Mm-hmm. It definitely that is definitely a bit of a weird thing
02:02:54 I I would not like make an argument based on that, but it is a no
02:02:58 Not accusing just speculating
02:03:01 Yeah, I know I know I'm aware
02:03:04 Allegedly
02:03:05 Yeah, like we've been we were trying to work this out for for like a year and he just stopped responding for four months straight at a
02:03:11 Certain point, so he made a call-out post which anytime someone brought it up on his twitter. He would just hide the reply
02:03:16 Um for like a week
02:03:19 And he just wasn't talking about it. So then they filed a dmca on a couple of images to like just get his attention and also because
02:03:26 We think it we read up on like how dmca works and like if you think you have a copyright claim
02:03:31 Which we think is valid you can do that and then he like came out and was like, oh, well
02:03:36 Well, the characters are obviously different. They look nothing alike
02:03:41 And also you don't even know your own character because
02:03:45 In in 2019 you said they were this tall and a couple years later you said they were like a few inches taller
02:03:50 So clearly you're dumb and don't know what your character is. He was like trying so hard to like
02:03:56 He was just trying so hard to like deflect everything and his I saw yeah
02:04:00 Yeah, he's right
02:04:01 And it was I saw your post where he tries to argue that they're not the same character based on and I like the really flimsy stuff
02:04:07 Like the different like foot anatomy when like even when he even when he draws the the original character
02:04:13 He draws them with that same foot. It's not like a character thing. It's just like the way he draws feet
02:04:18 Yeah, exactly
02:04:19 Like I have received a lot of fan art of my character and everyone draws the horns differently
02:04:24 On on my character. She's like a demon girl people draw the horns differently all the time and probably because like
02:04:29 um the way they
02:04:31 Look at the reference. Maybe they misunderstood the reference images I have or maybe if they just like drawing horns a certain way
02:04:37 Um, it doesn't mean it's a new character all of a sudden that's theirs that they can claim as their own
02:04:41 um
02:04:44 Let me stop unless I'm a bit maybe though like but what if I want your character to be
02:04:50 Is your character by?
02:04:52 My character will fuck everything. Are they gay? Okay. What if I want them to be I wanted to make them an insult
02:04:57 Yeah, I want to make them an insult
02:05:00 My character is literally unfuckable. I there's cannot be fucked under no circumstances
02:05:07 But it looks exactly like what's what's her name? What's the character's name?
02:05:10 Let it did something not lydia. What's her name?
02:05:15 Lydia from breaking bad literally unfuckable. No, not no
02:05:19 Oh my god, dude. She's so hot oblivion fall. What's her name? What's your character's name?
02:05:26 stevia
02:05:28 Are you can you hear me? Yeah, are you are you asking me a question? Yes. Yes. Oh, no, no, no my character's name is
02:05:34 Is is fallia. Sorry. Oh fallia fallia. Okay. Well, my fallia. This is my fallia is is just
02:05:42 Is just gross is ugly looks the same but mine is ugly and nobody likes her mine is infallible
02:05:50 And you can't have a copyright claim because uh, you've drawn her with differently sized boobs in the past
02:05:55 Sometimes you draw them really big and sometimes you draw them
02:05:58 Even bigger than that
02:06:00 Yeah
02:06:01 So clearly you have no consistency and you can't have a copyright claim. Yeah, it's basically
02:06:07 It's obviously different. Yeah
02:06:09 It's it's it's spelled the same but mine is pronounced failure and failure
02:06:14 Is a is a fake fail failure is a z z z cup and fallia is only a y y y
02:06:21 Failure is what I am. Oh why?
02:06:25 Uh, okay. Anyway
02:06:27 failure
02:06:29 That's my yeah, that's mine. She can't get laid
02:06:33 Amazing dark dark mirror
02:06:37 whole version
02:06:39 so
02:06:40 Yeah, this guy seems like he wants
02:06:44 To have his fucking way with it. He wants to have his way with this cat girl
02:06:52 We just if that's if that's if that's the goal though, why not just be like
02:06:58 Fuck what you want. I'm gonna just draw her
02:07:02 Regardless of whether you accept it or not
02:07:05 Because like
02:07:06 Isn't that what she's doing?
02:07:08 Well, no, no, no, I mean it's just keep doing fan art however you want, you know
02:07:12 Like regardless of what the intention of the original creator is
02:07:16 It seems like I feel like this might have been done to try and mitigate controversy, but this only
02:07:22 Is worse. It's worse because you're not just like you're taking a character on top
02:07:27 Putting it in this situation the artist doesn't like you're like doing two things instead of just one
02:07:32 Uh, it seems like a very poorly thought out plan
02:07:36 I I guess it's like I guess maybe he just he's just so compelled by this character
02:07:40 But it's like, but I would write I would make this character different though
02:07:43 But isn't it strange that if you're compelled for the character you're you're now arguing that the character is different
02:07:48 So like by your own definition, you've kind of like moved your own goalpost
02:07:53 It's like having enough shame to not just make a carbon copy of that character that is just named differently, but not having
02:08:02 It's having too much shame to god. I'm getting this backwards there. Let me work on this. Give me give me five minutes
02:08:08 Too much too. No, you're right too too much shame to just admit it. Yeah
02:08:13 You have enough shame to have started and gone this path
02:08:18 Right, right like a weird level weird in between of shame
02:08:22 Yeah, I feel I feel like you could have just gotten away with saying. Yeah, I I I draw your character and I made them straight
02:08:31 Yeah, I you wouldn't really need to say that you can just commit to the bit
02:08:35 And then and just say just say in your own in your own art like people go to your page
02:08:39 I see your art and then you say fan art of this oc
02:08:43 Then people will there's nothing to worry about people go to the actual artist to you know, you know, you know what?
02:08:48 You know what? I'm gonna go to bat a little bit and say that in this scenario
02:08:53 I think that would be fucked because this guy is a bigger artist
02:08:56 I think it would be a little fucked for a bigger artist to take the oc of a smaller artist and make like fan art of them
02:09:02 That is like well, correct. There's there's no good move here. I think what you're talking about like the less
02:09:09 This thing is kind of what matters because just a kind of thing on it
02:09:12 I don't know how much of your friend has put in their character, but
02:09:17 If any of themselves is in that character that still is kind of fucked up to do to someone
02:09:21 That's that's definitely the most fucked up part. True. Yeah, I
02:09:25 I really think okay. I really think that like yeah what you're saying tom
02:09:28 Like just like just draw fan art and have it be whoever you want
02:09:31 I would say yes
02:09:32 If it were a small artist doing that to the character of a bigger artist
02:09:35 But for a bigger artist to take the character of a smaller artist and draw art of them doing things that contradict
02:09:41 The power dynamic like what the creator thinks about them
02:09:44 I don't like my my brain and I think that's my brain is going to like people doing like fan art of tracer
02:09:49 Like fucking dudes, even though she's like canonically a lesbian, but like obviously the scale is much different in terms of like creative
02:09:55 But who cares who cares what blizzard right?
02:09:59 Yeah, yeah, I'm just I'm just surprised like this guy didn't just take that
02:10:03 Avenue, you know like it's still wrong, but I'm just surprised going this extra step and causing extra controversy
02:10:09 It seems extra stupid and correctly to just make the same character again and just say yeah, I do
02:10:16 Actually, this is mine
02:10:18 All right, I'll say it to the artist who is definitely listening. Um, you're not actually you're not actually banging the character you want
02:10:24 It's it's not that one
02:10:27 Please
02:10:29 Please stop edging right now
02:10:31 Just
02:10:32 This is like this is like that episode of the future drama. This is like kid Napster
02:10:37 Oh god is yeah, hell yeah
02:10:40 It all comes back
02:10:41 The episode's come full circle
02:10:44 If he he should he should he should put the character on the blockchain. He should mint it as an nft
02:10:51 Oh, no, no, no
02:10:54 Why why not why not there's no rules to get my legal fund made up
02:10:58 ready to go
02:11:00 Gonna sell nfts for that to fight that dmca claim
02:11:04 Oh, I can't say the hairstyle of a character is based on my friend's real hair. That's definitely one thing
02:11:12 Based indeed
02:11:14 That's what we like to call in the business weird champ
02:11:23 My friend told him if he changed the hairstyle like like months ago
02:11:26 My friend told him like maybe he could just change the hairstyle and put like a stripe in it
02:11:29 And yeah, it would be and he didn't do it you could you could you could totally
02:11:34 You could totally just change the hair and like most things could stay pretty much the same
02:11:38 You would only need to make minimal changes. I mean not not to shit on the character design
02:11:42 But it's like not generic, but like it's non-descript enough that a small deviation like that is all the plausible deniability
02:11:49 You'd need I do actually genuinely like I said give him a hand. It's just a power thing of just not even
02:11:54 Not even conceiving something that yeah
02:11:57 It's it can't it's gotta be it's about the fact it's about like this
02:12:02 It's about where the character comes from. It's not about the design. It's about like this is this character specifically
02:12:10 He spent a year drawing
02:12:11 He spent a year drawing fan art of the design and then a switch flipped and he
02:12:16 Spent another year drawing it as his own character
02:12:20 Like the timeline is just switched
02:12:23 He's put in the work. He deserves this character. I think you're right. You know what it changed my mind. I changed my mind
02:12:30 He earned it
02:12:32 Oh, no, I think I think
02:12:35 10 grand 10 grand or so. You know transition of power
02:12:40 You know his money where his mouth is
02:12:43 Actually, maybe your artist should make an nft of this character and then have this guy buy it make that joke. Oh, no
02:12:50 I'm sorry. I'm sorry the blockchain is a revolutionary technology
02:12:56 For just such now now we can settle disputes like this before it was all he said she said now
02:13:02 We can just we can just refer to the blockchain and understand ownership
02:13:05 You don't own this character
02:13:07 You just own a receipt that says you own the character and that's the best you can really do
02:13:11 If you have a receipt the beepers at the store don't go off and you can leave
02:13:16 Hmm
02:13:21 Oh like shoplifting. Oh like shoplifting like I did
02:13:25 in that one video
02:13:27 That oblivion followed me and then that I did it in pencil mates. It all comes back together
02:13:31 It's all tied together. It's all true in a spirograph of meaning
02:13:37 Uh
02:13:38 It all wraps around. Yeah, it's a spiral. We've all we've all we've wrapped all the way around. We've come 360
02:13:44 I guess anyone got any more uh shit. They want to bring up
02:13:48 My topic feels or wait. Are we are we done on are we are we have we said all we can have to say about uh
02:13:54 Missy I feel like we could head into voicemails soon ish. I uh if anyone
02:14:00 Huh, I'm just glad my topic was so shit and I'm glad we can avoid it
02:14:06 I know wait
02:14:08 Say it. Did you know it? Oh wait? I would oh wait. You didn't say it yet. No, um, but we we skin
02:14:14 We like we have to cross it. We surfed over it basically
02:14:19 Oh, we got it. We got to dig deep. We got to dig deep on the start. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't realize
02:14:23 I was gonna my intro to it was basically you know how
02:14:28 When you when you kind of mentioned, you know, you can bring whatever topic you want and I
02:14:33 I was working on watch dogs legion video
02:14:35 So I like barely had time to think and then I I finished it. I was like, okay, I gotta get back to then
02:14:39 I said to the message and then I apologetically say I've got um, I've got a topic
02:14:43 But it's shit and you say I'll out be on brand and I'm like, well
02:14:46 Yeah, yeah
02:14:48 You said well, I'm dead like it was you said it was shit and I'm sure and I'm sure it's been talked about before
02:14:55 And I was like that's that's completely on brand fresh and I was like, well shit now. I better not think of another topic
02:15:00 I better just commit. I'll be sure to I'll be sure to go in saying it shit
02:15:05 And my topic was just gonna be and also at the time I thought it would be like
02:15:09 Even keel 50 percent american 50 percent british
02:15:13 But now we're massively outnumbered because it was
02:15:17 Because it was being it was being british on the internet. It was
02:15:22 The perception of being a british person and then I thought about that because I was playing not so good these days
02:15:29 I was just thinking like being british on the internet is a weird mixed bag
02:15:33 Because it's because we get if you're doing youtube videos
02:15:36 You just get a leg up because the accent makes people think you're clever no matter what yeah
02:15:42 Yeah, that's the weird thing with me though is like people can't tell that I have an english
02:15:49 I don't know what accent I have. It's definitely informed a little bit by
02:15:54 Americans talking on video. Yeah, and I've sort of adopted some mannerism. So people think I'm not british
02:16:01 You got to lean into it more. That's that's the power you you don't know if that's true
02:16:06 You and snake in my opinion and everyone can disagree if they want but in my opinion like
02:16:11 Neither of you have what I would consider to be like a very like
02:16:15 Like stereotypically or like very like obviously british accent. I'm like a stereotype is like a posh
02:16:22 Wanker
02:16:25 From the victorian era
02:16:27 You sound exactly like what I think of in my head when I think of a british accent. It's funny because when I
02:16:34 This is gonna sound really weird. It's like
02:16:37 I used to have sorry
02:16:39 I used to have a weirdly set dislike of other british people on the internet
02:16:43 Especially when they leaned into it for points or they like I am the british game rubber
02:16:48 It's like fucking have a personality
02:16:51 It's just don't yeah gaming brit and and uh total biscuit had like the the cynical brit
02:17:00 I've actually met the guy in real life. I like both of those guys
02:17:03 I mean, I guess it sort of makes sense because on the internet your voice is so important
02:17:08 So like if you're obviously british, I guess maybe you got to lean into it
02:17:11 a little bit maybe
02:17:13 The thing I didn't like about those is that I think it's just sort of a
02:17:18 If you wave the flag and you're like
02:17:21 I'm proud of my country
02:17:22 That's sort of like an american thing to wave the flag constantly and to be like hey look at what my nationality is everybody
02:17:28 That's sort of like a thing that
02:17:30 You don't do all the time. You do that when you you know as a special occasion. Oh the queen's getting another divorce
02:17:37 I don't know
02:17:39 In my mind like even british patriotism has a an angle of shame about it from what I've seen
02:17:46 Yeah, as it's there's always like a I love my country, but we're a bit shit and that's
02:17:52 I something fun. I'm always I don't think that people who exploit being british on the internet really do
02:17:59 I saw something I saw like a tweet or something that was like, uh, like yeah, like amer- american nationalism is like
02:18:05 We love guns and god and we love our greatest country in the world and and british nationalism is like
02:18:12 Yeah, it's shit here and that's just how we like it
02:18:17 That was that was like a lot of the humor when I was growing up was like every comedian
02:18:22 The most pro british thing would just be a love of how shit we are as a doing things. Yeah
02:18:29 There'll be observational stand-up comedy about like
02:18:32 Uh, I know all those other countries. They're doing all this and we're over here and it's shit and oh
02:18:37 We're standing in queues. Why do we like queuing as a nation? That's stupid. Ha ha ha
02:18:44 That's what it's like being british. I have heard I've heard a few different places
02:18:48 And I think this is really funny that apparently there is a certain uh attitude
02:18:53 In canadian politics. There is a particular, uh, what's the word? Um
02:18:59 Fixation or phobia of like not appearing to american
02:19:04 Like if you say if you say anything that sounds like too american, it's kind of cringe. It's like
02:19:09 Like there is a lot of like there's a lot of very like similar
02:19:13 Like nationalist and like like uh pro like trump. It basically trumpism sort of attitudes
02:19:19 Like they have it in canada as well, but they can't
02:19:22 Like say it that way
02:19:24 Because if you phrase it if you phrase it as like a pro trump way
02:19:27 That's like american and like you don't want to be seen as like being a big america stan
02:19:32 He's it's it's it's it's look down upon in canada. They really
02:19:36 They really want to have their own identity like we're definitely we're not america. We're not just america's hat guys
02:19:41 We're we're we got our own thing going on. We we're under the queen over here, right?
02:19:46 Yeah, they uh, now i'm imagining blackface over there. Yeah
02:19:50 Trump would never do that. Come on trump get the blackface out. Show us what you're all about
02:19:55 He could he could he he just he just runs he just puts on blackface makeup and runs in canada and replaces trudeau
02:20:02 Because they just love it so much
02:20:05 That's our prime minister right there. He's like pretends he gets he he loses 2020 so in 2024
02:20:10 He decides no i'm not gonna run against joe. No i'm not gonna run against kamala. No the kamala p tickets too strong
02:20:16 No one can beat it. Hey, I'll run it. I'll run in canada. I'll run it. It's unstoppable
02:20:21 It's an unstoppable combo. You can't you can't beat it. Uh, so i'll run in canada instead
02:20:26 I I could do I could do blackface like it worked for that other guy
02:20:30 You know what they say black is the new orange
02:20:41 Oh my god
02:20:45 It's all downhill from here. We can't we can't stop that
02:20:48 Can't keep getting away with it
02:20:50 uh, the
02:20:52 Oh, you were gonna say you smashed into something
02:20:54 I I smashed into boris johnson. No, I nearly smashed into boris johnson ones and like like in your car took him out
02:21:03 No, uh on foot. Oh, okay
02:21:05 Like I almost ran over. I was gonna say if it was your car like you should have gone for it
02:21:09 I mean I was on foot and I should have gone for it
02:21:13 Ruck be tackled in fair enough
02:21:15 I I used to volunteer with a group called, um
02:21:20 Good gym and it was
02:21:22 It was this weird mix of like
02:21:24 Exercise jogging and charity work. You would like jog to a place and like volunteer there for an hour
02:21:29 And then you'd jog back and you'd do that every week in different places
02:21:34 And over christmas we had um we had a thing a homeless shelter
02:21:39 And fucking boris johnson was there with his press team and he was just like pretending to look like he was getting involved
02:21:45 Like they'd film a shot of him, you know at the counter or just in the kitchens doing something
02:21:50 While we did do all the actual work like we had been jogging for an hour at this point like we had
02:21:54 I had done two tasks that day one of them was like carry like jogging with a backpack full of fucking tinned food
02:22:00 Like two kilometers across london to move it somewhere else
02:22:04 And then we had to jog there and then we got split into groups and I decided i'll go to the homeless shelter
02:22:09 That was something outside
02:22:12 And then we were told hey boris johnson is here and we're all getting roped into being in a fucking advert for him
02:22:19 So you were you were just there as like you were just there on your own
02:22:24 Uh as a group good gym was a group thing. There was about 10 15 20 of us. Okay
02:22:29 And like we were we were there to just actually volunteer
02:22:32 I'm kind of annoyed for several reasons which the primary one not just politically is just that
02:22:37 We were actually there to try and help and we were on a limited time
02:22:40 So why are we being roped into being a background shot for this cunt? Yeah, like
02:22:45 But but we were and I just let's just figure out. Fuck it. I'll be on I'll be on tv
02:22:49 I guess I didn't really put together at the time be on tv for this guy
02:22:54 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
02:22:56 Yeah, and the the shot they wanted planned was hey, how about we tie it in with good gym?
02:23:01 We have boris standing in this lobby. It wasn't actually a lobby. It was a kind of
02:23:06 Subterranean area
02:23:07 Uh while all you guys come running in through the door and you run past him like you coming in twos one of you runs left
02:23:14 One of you runs, right?
02:23:16 It's the problem. This is so fucked up. They just like hey you guys you got to be in a you got to be in a commercial for the president
02:23:23 What the what the fuck he wasn't he wasn't uh prime him at the time prime in oh right he was
02:23:30 Um, you know, he was pre prime in but he's he's there now
02:23:35 and
02:23:37 Uh, so here's the problem
02:23:39 Well, there's many problems, but here's my physical problem was the
02:23:43 The area outside the door was actually just this tiny little alleyway because it wasn't really a an entrance exit
02:23:49 It just led out into this little subterranean area beside the building
02:23:52 You could barely stand shoulder to shoulder, but we had to jog do a 90
02:23:57 45 my under bad angles. We had to do a hard turn into the building
02:24:03 and then
02:24:04 Go up a step then jog in and jog to the side of him
02:24:08 I did not quite have the grace of foot to do all those motions. Was he jogging or was he just standing there?
02:24:14 He was just standing there while we all jogged past him. I get in missed the step. I'm like stumbling and they made you exercise too
02:24:22 I'm about to take a hard step
02:24:24 And this was actually when I was more fit. I've been out of it for a while
02:24:27 This is when I was like jogging all the time and
02:24:30 Actually taking care of myself
02:24:37 And like I stumble and I'm about to like I'm about to eat shit really bad
02:24:42 And then I I reach my arm out to grab something and I feel I feel something and my
02:24:47 You have almost moments in life where the world goes into slow motion
02:24:51 and you think
02:24:52 What oh, I know who that is. I know what I'm about to do. I'm on camera and I just
02:24:58 Using everything just right myself
02:25:01 Run past the thing
02:25:02 Probably looked really clumsy. I've never looked at the footage. I've never so you were so you were about to trip and fall
02:25:08 And collide with Boris Johnson
02:25:10 But you yes
02:25:12 But I wrongly saved myself
02:25:16 The one time to not trip and hit Boris Johnson
02:25:19 Yeah, I should have gone all in. I should have bought the first gave him a little donkey punch. I don't know
02:25:25 You should have pinned him to the ground
02:25:28 I'm like you should have tripped and like accidentally grabbed his like boom like oh my gosh. Oh, no
02:25:35 He's like
02:25:37 You should have had a you should have had a piece of toast in your mouth while you were running
02:25:42 Oh, yeah, it's to have a lovely romantic one. They call him senpai
02:25:48 The you know this reminds me what is the prime minister or not the old joe san can't be this cute
02:25:55 Oh god
02:25:59 What's up oblivion I was just saying this reminds me of a time that I had an encounter with the prime minister of new zealand
02:26:05 um
02:26:07 You guys you guys have a prime minister. What the fuck? I never see the president
02:26:11 All right, so in in 2005 prime minister helen clark came down to otago university for some of that otago university
02:26:19 No otago
02:26:22 Enroll me, okay
02:26:24 Okay, my dad my dad was doing his phd at the university. I was I think I was home school at the time
02:26:28 So I was just they just took me to university with them and it was cool. Um
02:26:33 I it was fun. But yeah, the prime minister was coming down my parents, um
02:26:38 You know weren't politically aligned with her. They were part of a peaceful protest
02:26:42 Against something. I don't know. I was too young to like really know what it was about. I was like 10
02:26:47 um liberal or something
02:26:49 I don't know. Um
02:26:52 My my parents are like
02:26:55 Right leaning
02:26:56 For new zealand standards, which is like dad centrist for by american standards. I don't know like a bernie sanders type
02:27:03 Yeah, yeah, maybe
02:27:06 Yeah, um, but but but anyways, um one of my parents friends, um
02:27:11 Glenn had a printout of the prime minister with like horns like
02:27:15 Talking and like nerd speaker some shit and I I had one of these and I she walked past
02:27:20 I held it up to her and I was like screaming
02:27:22 And she just waved and smiled at me and walked by
02:27:26 And then later that day, um
02:27:28 Like she was on camera talking to press my mom was in the background holing up a speeding sign because um
02:27:33 uh prime minister helen clark had recently like been caught speeding like
02:27:37 Driving way over the fucking limit and she was like, oh, I'm gonna go see a rugby game or some shit. Um, and my parents
02:27:43 I guess they just thought that was really funny. So they made like a fake speeding sign
02:27:46 And it's made out of like paper like not like your regular printer paper, but that really like flimsy packing paper
02:27:52 Um, they just yeah, okay
02:27:55 Cabinet minister pete hogson like grabbed my mom and like pulled the sign out of her hand and threw it to the ground and like
02:28:01 yelled at her and it was caught on camera
02:28:03 And then how fucking funny if i'm if america was like a tiny little island and like sometimes you would go to like
02:28:10 You would go to one of these things and like, I don't know fucking, uh, uh, uh, who is the who is the like mike
02:28:16 Pence just like tackles you say
02:28:18 Hey, yeah, what are you doing here? Get out of here
02:28:21 No, the police got involved
02:28:22 My mom was on the fucking channel free news to talk about it
02:28:25 I think that was um
02:28:27 Like a year ago when I mentioned that my parents would be on the news
02:28:30 I think this was one of the incidents that was about where bite
02:28:32 They sent an interviewer to a house to pre-record the interview
02:28:35 But then they played the videos of my mom's pre-recorded interview and pretended it was a live thing
02:28:41 Um, yo, yeah, yeah
02:28:43 Yeah
02:28:45 Yeah, I think that was related to that but
02:28:49 I just remember that that happened
02:28:51 um, I I generally don't remember much about
02:28:54 The political ramifications ramifications of anything back then that my parents were involved in sure, but um
02:29:01 Funny stuff
02:29:03 Uh, guys, I need to go. There's a prior engagement. I I forgot about
02:29:10 But uh, I thought it was a good episode
02:29:12 Hell yeah, the snake where it was nice to meet you. It was very nice to speak to you
02:29:16 And uh, yes, goodbye everybody. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. See you and bye
02:29:21 She said that she had a thing to do in the morning and she was going to be back
02:29:26 For the evening and that's why we moved the time later
02:29:29 I wonder if it ended up changing so that she had to do it later and maybe we should have done two things to do
02:29:34 Maybe there were two. Maybe there were just two things too. Yeah
02:29:38 Hard hard to imagine
02:29:40 But I guess yeah, two things in one day two things in one day
02:29:44 Can you that's that's too much? I don't know. I'll be some people have all the luck
02:29:47 I'm up here trying to scrape up one dang thing to do in a week
02:29:52 geez louise
02:29:54 uh
02:29:56 Things to do as I go you got it. You got to make your own fun
02:30:01 I uh, all right. All right, so we have been going for two two. We're a 240
02:30:07 Uh, I feel like there's 240p. What shut up
02:30:11 um
02:30:13 Is there anything else? I like any other urgent matters to discuss before we move on to uh
02:30:19 To uh, all right that that talk about being british went on longer than I thought it would I thought I had like one thing
02:30:25 And it was just a bit a thing of I stopped playing up being british online. It's really annoying
02:30:31 You're making us look even worse. We can bring any topic of every last little bit of gold that's there. It's we're good at that
02:30:39 Had a hundred and ninety something episode two hundred and ninety something episode wherever the fuck we're at. I don't even know
02:30:44 We've been at it a while the
02:30:47 Nations nations will fall and uh history will turn the winds will grind
02:30:54 The sand the desert sands will grind the the the mountains down
02:31:00 To to flat planes and and and and the and british people will still be playing up how british they are on the internet
02:31:08 Uh for cloud besides anything else. I'm half irish, so
02:31:12 Hey, i'm a quarter. Hey, i'm a i'm a quarter irish. Nice to meet you brother
02:31:18 Fellow mick
02:31:20 Well, you can I guess you can say it
02:31:24 My dad used to I don't know if my dad would slap me. Maybe maybe not
02:31:30 All right tv show called
02:31:33 The the mick uh, it was on uh, I think it was on fx or something. Hmm
02:31:39 Was it about is it not is it not as bad of a word as I thought it was?
02:31:44 I i'm gonna be honest. I don't actually fully understand how bad it is. I just feel
02:31:49 I kind of thought I kind of thought it was a pretty nasty, but I don't know. I mean I imagine it's been defined
02:31:55 I don't think it's a reclaimed word or anything. I mean i i'm i'm just i'm just fucking plastic you can
02:32:02 You can call I mean you can call nalleners kiwi, and that's fine, right
02:32:07 Right
02:32:11 Uh, you love it. You love it. Yeah, I do. You're stroking yeah
02:32:15 Yeah, good, okay.
02:32:19 I've got a quarter, I've got a quarter of Scott in me,
02:32:21 but I don't just flippantly use jock.
02:32:24 So I think I've put the arbitrary cut off
02:32:26 at being half something.
02:32:29 Jock, is that a Scottish thing?
02:32:31 Yeah, that's a derogatory term for a Scott as a jock.
02:32:34 Oh, I know that.
02:32:35 What?
02:32:36 I've never, no.
02:32:37 Yeah.
02:32:37 It's not just like the football chat and the music.
02:32:40 You literally called yourself a jock earlier,
02:32:43 but you were talking about in like the sense of-
02:32:45 I was talking about a different kind of jock.
02:32:47 Yeah.
02:32:48 Not the Scottish jock.
02:32:49 Interesting.
02:32:50 The language is fun.
02:32:50 Yeah, this is why music should only,
02:32:52 you should never have lyrics
02:32:53 because words are fucking terrible.
02:32:55 Second full circle.
02:32:57 That's a Venn diagram, baby, voicemails.
02:32:59 Beautiful.
02:33:00 You said you've got a quarter of Scott in you.
02:33:04 And I thought you-
02:33:05 No, no, no, it's probably not even that.
02:33:06 And I thought you said you've got a quarter of Scott in you.
02:33:10 I was like, wow, we progressed from that one beer from before.
02:33:14 Actually, I had that and a wine,
02:33:16 which you all not meant to mix,
02:33:17 but it was already there.
02:33:18 Opshaw.
02:33:19 Opshaw.
02:33:20 Who says, doctors, what do they know?
02:33:25 Genuinely, one of the biggest pieces of advice
02:33:27 my dad gave me was don't mix grape and grain.
02:33:29 That's the one bit of advice I remember.
02:33:31 Grape and grain?
02:33:33 Grape?
02:33:34 You know, what?
02:33:35 Grape and grain.
02:33:35 It's basically don't mix wine with other kinds of alcohol.
02:33:39 That's so silly.
02:33:40 That's so funny.
02:33:41 I mean, that's how you get the-
02:33:42 Mixing alcohol is how you get the worst.
02:33:43 They both start with the G.R.A.
02:33:45 They're made for each other.
02:33:46 Grape and grain, I've never-
02:33:48 Yeah, beer before liquor is the-
02:33:51 Beer before liquor never been sicker
02:33:53 is the one that I know.
02:33:56 And what's beer-
02:33:58 Liquor before beer, you're in the clear.
02:34:00 You're in the clear, that's right.
02:34:01 That's how it goes.
02:34:04 There's a lot of advice about how you should drink.
02:34:08 I suppose the best advice is-
02:34:10 Probably don't.
02:34:11 Have fun.
02:34:12 Just have fun with it.
02:34:13 Yeah, definitely.
02:34:15 Have fun and be yourself.
02:34:17 Yeah.
02:34:20 Anyway.
02:34:22 So we've learned even more now.
02:34:24 I think we should start voicemails
02:34:27 if you guys are up for it.
02:34:29 Hell yeah.
02:34:30 I mean, I never am, but I do them anyway.
02:34:34 Okay, well, here we go.
02:34:37 I'm gonna post them in the general.
02:34:39 Let me find, okay.
02:34:44 Did I, oh, shit.
02:34:46 Did I save these in the wrong order?
02:34:50 Did I save these?
02:34:51 We're gonna get through all of them anyway,
02:34:52 so it doesn't matter what the order is.
02:34:54 I, well, I need to know, yeah, okay.
02:34:58 All right, this, okay, I found it, all right.
02:35:00 First one, the first one is called when,
02:35:04 and here it is.
02:35:06 It's called when question mark.
02:35:08 So if you guys are ready,
02:35:10 in three, two, one, play.
02:35:14 All right, week three, me asking,
02:35:16 the who, what, when, where, why, of Radgon?
02:35:19 When will Radgon be?
02:35:22 You asked this already.
02:35:23 Do you guys think this will be a soon future endeavor?
02:35:28 No.
02:35:29 Or later, and when do you want it to be?
02:35:33 And when do you realistically think it'll be?
02:35:35 I don't know, there's only so many ways I can phrase when.
02:35:39 It won't be for a while.
02:35:42 Snake, do you know what Radgon is?
02:35:45 Yeah, I've watched the PCP lectures.
02:35:47 Actually, I forgot to say that, yeah,
02:35:48 that was actually a big part of what I did listen to
02:35:51 that got me into the PCP.
02:35:53 I forgot you mentioned a...
02:35:55 You mentioned the lectures.
02:35:57 I have watched most all of them, so, yeah.
02:36:01 Do you have a favorite one, Snake?
02:36:04 Yeah.
02:36:05 My favorite one, god.
02:36:06 Give me a fucking minute on that.
02:36:09 I think it is actually, I think it is
02:36:11 either the Son of Chew or the Bloody Son of Chew
02:36:14 or the Tales Gets Told lecture,
02:36:16 because they were just topics that I'm more
02:36:18 intimately familiar with.
02:36:21 And it's like, it's always being broken down.
02:36:24 Yeah.
02:36:25 The JDR and the Animorphs one are probably my favorites.
02:36:28 I really enjoy, I do really enjoy Munchie's ones.
02:36:30 I only recently learned that he's a lot calmer.
02:36:33 And that was actually very pleasant to learn.
02:36:35 In real life, he's much more,
02:36:37 he's still very loud.
02:36:38 He has a very loud voice, but he's much more,
02:36:40 he's much more low-key in real life.
02:36:44 If I had to pick, yeah, among the ones that are not mine,
02:36:47 I would probably say Animorph,
02:36:49 maybe Animorphs and Kingdom Hearts
02:36:51 are probably my two favorites.
02:36:53 Aside from mine.
02:36:54 I enjoy Nates.
02:36:55 I enjoy Nates.
02:36:57 Kingdom Hearts is pretty good.
02:36:59 I like the kind of raw enthusiasm he kind of brings to him.
02:37:03 Yeah, yeah, he does.
02:37:05 Because I love Jeff, he's my favorite.
02:37:07 I love Jeff.
02:37:09 We need to have him at Redcon 4.0.
02:37:11 Where's Jeff's lecture?
02:37:13 Yeah, if we ever did anything else like that in the future,
02:37:17 I mean, it wouldn't be...
02:37:18 Jeff would be there.
02:37:20 We haven't even thought about it,
02:37:22 and like, we're still thinking about getting all the final stuff
02:37:25 from Last Redcon out and produce and release, so...
02:37:28 You're gonna clear that.
02:37:29 Not even start thinking about the next one.
02:37:33 So it wouldn't...
02:37:34 It couldn't be that soon, even if we wanted it to.
02:37:36 I don't know.
02:37:38 Okay, the next one is called
02:37:41 In This Voice Mail I Nate So Hard.
02:37:47 There it is.
02:37:49 3, 2, 1, go.
02:37:55 No Nate November.
02:37:57 More like, Nate never makes anything.
02:38:00 Wait, what's this?
02:38:02 New Gamer Zone episode.
02:38:04 Featuring Giggit.
02:38:06 Hold up, I think I just lost this challenge.
02:38:11 Gross.
02:38:12 Fallen Soldier.
02:38:13 Amazing.
02:38:15 He will never be allowed into the Nate fucker ranks.
02:38:17 He's not worthy.
02:38:19 What a shame.
02:38:20 He's Nazi in heaven.
02:38:23 Next Voice Mail is an image.
02:38:27 Let's post it.
02:38:31 The fuck is this?
02:38:33 What is this?
02:38:36 I'm not familiar with this format.
02:38:39 Well, this is me mining cryptocurrency
02:38:42 at Redcon 3, I think.
02:38:45 Probably.
02:38:47 Who is you getting assimilated into the blockchain?
02:38:51 This is me mining for Slimecoin.
02:38:53 I'm getting slimy in here.
02:38:55 I am having a good time.
02:38:58 I like this.
02:39:00 This one's going in the Favorites file.
02:39:03 Okay, next one is called I'm So Fucked Up.
02:39:07 So Fucked Up.
02:39:09 Wait, it's loading.
02:39:11 Come on.
02:39:12 Okay, there it goes.
02:39:13 3, 2, 1, go.
02:39:15 Why, when you really got a P,
02:39:18 it's like, ooh, that sucks.
02:39:19 But then you P and it's like, ah, so rude.
02:39:22 Tell me about it.
02:39:23 When you got a shit, when you really got a shit,
02:39:26 it's like orders of magnitude worse than really having a P.
02:39:30 It's like torture.
02:39:31 It sucks so bad.
02:39:33 And then sometimes when you do shit,
02:39:35 it just feels like you still got a shit
02:39:37 and you just wait until your bowels calm the fuck down.
02:39:40 What the hell?
02:39:41 What the fuck?
02:39:43 So fucked up.
02:39:45 That's called the gape.
02:39:47 You're experiencing the gape, my friend.
02:39:52 You have to wait for your body to un-gape.
02:39:55 I feel like if you don't shit for long enough,
02:39:57 your asshole will just close,
02:39:59 but we're just constantly damaging it just enough
02:40:01 to maintain equilibrium.
02:40:03 I learned this.
02:40:05 If you don't shit,
02:40:07 like if you hold it in,
02:40:09 you can prevent yourself from shitting for a while,
02:40:12 but if you don't shit,
02:40:15 it feels bad.
02:40:17 Your body, like,
02:40:19 moisture absorbs out of the poop
02:40:22 through your large intestine.
02:40:24 And the longer it spends in your large intestine,
02:40:26 the drier it becomes.
02:40:28 And so when you do eventually shit it,
02:40:30 it will be harder and drier
02:40:32 because you absorb the moisture out of it.
02:40:34 Because it spent more time in there.
02:40:36 I don't know.
02:40:37 What should you do with this information?
02:40:39 I don't know.
02:40:40 I'm not a doctor.
02:40:41 It's as small as poop fast.
02:40:42 Or take the dry shit challenge.
02:40:44 I would say yes.
02:40:46 You should probably shit...
02:40:48 Don't hold it in.
02:40:49 Guys, listen.
02:40:50 Viewers, please.
02:40:51 Don't hold...
02:40:52 Don't hold it in.
02:40:53 Listen, everybody.
02:40:54 Please take part in dry shit December.
02:40:59 It's the heaviest product going.
02:41:01 Dry it!
02:41:02 Dump this in there!
02:41:04 No!
02:41:05 No!
02:41:10 We did it.
02:41:12 Let us know how it goes.
02:41:14 Hold it in for a whole month and see how dry it is.
02:41:21 Send it in.
02:41:22 Send it in.
02:41:24 Don't...
02:41:25 It's not to hear somewhere.
02:41:26 Send it to somewhere and they'll...
02:41:28 Obviously.
02:41:29 They'll get back to you.
02:41:31 Better than doing an advent calendar, I guess.
02:41:35 Well, if you hold it out long enough,
02:41:37 it can be part of next year's advent calendar.
02:41:45 The next voicemail is called
02:41:48 a fried vocalist.
02:41:52 There it is.
02:41:53 It's loading.
02:41:54 Okay.
02:41:55 Three, two, one, go.
02:41:58 I have bipolar.
02:42:01 I have to sort over there.
02:42:07 Sounds like someone has already started
02:42:10 dry something December.
02:42:12 D-D-D-D.
02:42:13 They've already started D-3.
02:42:15 D-D-D-D.
02:42:16 Actually, they're already struggling
02:42:18 on the first day of December, it says.
02:42:21 When you successfully complete
02:42:24 Dry Dump December,
02:42:26 you get crowned King D-D-D.
02:42:29 That's the lore.
02:42:31 That's the Kirby lore every YouTuber tells me about.
02:42:34 Because Kirby's all about eating,
02:42:36 his antagonist, King D-D-D,
02:42:38 he's all about shitting.
02:42:39 It's the end of the day.
02:42:41 Boss, end of the expert.
02:42:43 Can you start Keto diet help on Dry Dump December?
02:42:47 Keto can sometimes give you diarrhea.
02:42:50 Sometimes.
02:42:51 Oh, okay, never mind.
02:42:52 It's spotty.
02:42:54 Sometimes when you start Keto,
02:42:56 you can get a little bit diarrhea-y,
02:42:58 but not always, and it's just temporary.
02:43:01 I don't know.
02:43:02 All I know is it dries you out,
02:43:05 but I don't know.
02:43:07 Well, I'm very serious about staying hydrated.
02:43:11 Okay.
02:43:12 I think it might dry some people out, but not me.
02:43:15 I'm built different.
02:43:18 Next one is called...
02:43:21 What is this?
02:43:24 It's called Oh No, I Failed NNN.
02:43:27 Well, you got DDD to look forward to.
02:43:29 Three, two, one, go.
02:43:32 You know, in listening to the latest
02:43:34 Gamer Zone episode,
02:43:36 and Nate's streams and shit,
02:43:40 I realized the reason Nate's not on the current PCP
02:43:45 is that he is a relic.
02:43:48 He's a fixture of the past.
02:43:50 He still does all the edgy jokes,
02:43:54 all the...
02:43:56 all the racy stuff,
02:43:58 all the sexist stuff,
02:44:02 and it's always funny,
02:44:04 but it doesn't fit with the current PCP anymore.
02:44:09 I don't know.
02:44:12 He just saw himself growing obsolete,
02:44:17 took himself back into the back of the fucking barn.
02:44:21 The shed and popped a cap in his own ass.
02:44:27 But, okay.
02:44:29 I love that you specified that it's still funny.
02:44:32 Oh, man.
02:44:34 If you think Nate is...
02:44:36 So why are you here not watching the Gamer Zone?
02:44:38 I don't understand.
02:44:40 Okay.
02:44:42 If you think his humor is dated and makes him a relic,
02:44:46 that's okay, but if you then say,
02:44:48 and it's funny,
02:44:50 that means you're a relic too, my dude.
02:44:52 You're right there with him.
02:44:54 It's either not a relic or you are also a relic.
02:44:57 I need a joke about the opium wars
02:44:59 and called Ben St. Amick earlier this episode.
02:45:03 You're getting canceled.
02:45:05 We're canceling Snake on this one.
02:45:07 Well, catch me on the Gamer Zone next month.
02:45:11 No, he would.
02:45:13 Nate would poach you like that.
02:45:14 He did it to Cyber Shell.
02:45:15 He'll do it to you.
02:45:17 I don't know.
02:45:18 I've never spoken to the guy.
02:45:20 A bunch of my patrons want you to go on the Gamer Zone,
02:45:22 and I'm just like, I don't know, man.
02:45:24 It seems a little too high tier for me.
02:45:30 I saw it enough.
02:45:31 Well, that's a bit too high concept.
02:45:35 What if Nate got Saber Spark and not you?
02:45:38 I mean, I would understand.
02:45:40 Why would you want someone with no following
02:45:42 when you have someone who has a huge following?
02:45:44 It's the stratification of podcasts.
02:45:50 You've got the Gamer Zone.
02:45:51 I'm the one who writes all Saber Spanger videos now,
02:45:53 but that's okay.
02:45:54 He can get all the credit.
02:45:56 Has he been gaining subscribers?
02:45:58 I feel like he was at 150.
02:46:00 Saber's at 1.5 mil.
02:46:02 No, no, no, Nate.
02:46:03 But is he still gaining?
02:46:04 Oh, Nate?
02:46:05 I have no idea what Nate's at.
02:46:06 He was at 150.
02:46:07 Nate has been up.
02:46:08 But now it's 114.
02:46:09 I think at the time, we even mentioned,
02:46:11 because before Nate hit 100K,
02:46:15 we had noticed the phenomenon on YouTube.
02:46:17 Once you hit 100K, you get accelerated in the algorithm,
02:46:21 and people hit 200K really quick.
02:46:23 And then it didn't happen to Nate.
02:46:26 It didn't happen.
02:46:27 It's like he's an anomaly.
02:46:28 I don't understand.
02:46:30 I'm going to press it at 100.
02:46:33 I think it's actually, maybe I'm thinking,
02:46:35 if you're hitting 100 fast, it's momentum.
02:46:37 I don't think you get a boost off.
02:46:39 I could be wrong.
02:46:40 There was, I mean,
02:46:41 there was something that was actually done.
02:46:43 That was like the common thing at the time.
02:46:46 At least the confusion.
02:46:47 I haven't a lot.
02:46:49 I didn't get the boost,
02:46:50 but I also haven't posted since I hit 100K.
02:46:53 Well, I guess that would help.
02:46:55 Yeah, it would help.
02:46:57 I'm still surpassing him though.
02:46:59 I'm still growing like 1,000 a month fish.
02:47:01 Damn.
02:47:02 I'm growing 1,000 a month,
02:47:03 and I don't think I'm going to get the boost
02:47:05 when I hit 100,000 if it does exist.
02:47:08 You're at like 90, right?
02:47:11 Oh, wow.
02:47:12 I thought you were bigger than me.
02:47:13 No, but I've been at this for a thing,
02:47:16 and I've just had very slow,
02:47:17 but steady growth throughout.
02:47:20 So for the last few years,
02:47:21 the ramp-ups have been very steady.
02:47:24 And honestly, I'm okay with the slower growth,
02:47:27 because I don't really care to get too big too fast.
02:47:30 I don't really care bigness,
02:47:31 as long as I just have a good base to work from.
02:47:35 That's the most important term.
02:47:38 I'm always thinking about,
02:47:40 I should really be doing something with my channel.
02:47:43 I'm not doing anything with it at the moment.
02:47:45 I should do something.
02:47:46 I mean, I'm doing my game right now.
02:47:48 It's really difficult to do weekly videos
02:47:51 on top of bigger creative projects.
02:47:54 Yeah, I wouldn't want to do that.
02:47:57 It sucks.
02:47:58 It sucks.
02:47:59 I don't know what I would...
02:48:00 I know I should be doing something with my channel
02:48:02 and trying to grow my channel,
02:48:04 but I don't know what I would want to do with it.
02:48:07 So I have no ideas.
02:48:08 I'm stupid.
02:48:10 That's the curse you expect.
02:48:13 I'm not going to tell you to do something
02:48:14 you don't want to do,
02:48:15 but maybe devlogs or just breakdowns
02:48:17 on what you're doing,
02:48:18 tie it into other projects,
02:48:19 but then you're just creating more work
02:48:21 on projects we're already doing.
02:48:22 It's always a balancing act of,
02:48:25 am I having fun with this?
02:48:26 Am I enjoying it?
02:48:27 Is this awful or painful?
02:48:28 I started doing devlogs for Patreon
02:48:30 just because I needed more bonus content
02:48:32 to throw on my Patreon,
02:48:33 and even that takes a lot of time away
02:48:35 from just actually doing work.
02:48:38 Yeah, that is the tricky part,
02:48:40 because I have that with my Patreon videos,
02:48:42 where it's like, I do enjoy doing them
02:48:44 and it gives people a chance to interact,
02:48:45 but it's like, it takes three or four days,
02:48:48 and it's like, this is three or four days
02:48:50 off the thing that your technically came from.
02:48:52 I'm so upset that Clubhouse didn't take off
02:48:54 and become a thing.
02:48:55 I was really hoping that the Zeitgeist
02:48:57 would shift to audio,
02:48:58 because just shitting out audio stuff
02:49:00 as we're doing right now
02:49:01 is the easiest thing on God's Earth,
02:49:03 and if that just became the de facto standard,
02:49:06 God, I could destroy the world.
02:49:09 Video is just such a fucking grind,
02:49:11 and it sucks, and I hate it.
02:49:15 What's Clubhouse?
02:49:16 Yeah, I don't like enough failure.
02:49:19 Clubhouse was an app,
02:49:20 but you know how Twitter has spaces
02:49:22 where people can just jump into live audio calls?
02:49:25 Yeah.
02:49:26 Wait, what?
02:49:27 They stole that from an app called Clubhouse,
02:49:29 which is just the same thing.
02:49:30 I saw one or two spaces.
02:49:31 Didn't they kill spaces, or are they still around?
02:49:33 No, they killed fleets.
02:49:35 They're pushing spaces hard now.
02:49:37 They killed fleets.
02:49:38 Oh, thank God fleets are gone.
02:49:39 That was stupid.
02:49:40 Yeah, that died.
02:49:42 I never even saw a single fleet.
02:49:44 I still don't know what fleets were.
02:49:46 They were Instagram stories on Twitter.
02:49:49 Oh, yeah, I don't use it on Google.
02:49:51 Because nobody can have an original idea anymore.
02:50:01 Voicemails.
02:50:02 Voicemails.
02:50:03 Oh, yeah, let's look at those voicemails.
02:50:06 Finally.
02:50:08 Shit.
02:50:10 Which episode?
02:50:11 Okay, the next one is called...
02:50:13 Full circle.
02:50:14 Oh, the next one is called Who Made the New Intro?
02:50:17 And the answer to that is I think Eleazar did, right?
02:50:20 That blessed that guy, that son of a bitch.
02:50:23 I think...
02:50:24 It was either that or there was a voicemailer.
02:50:27 No, it was a voicemailer.
02:50:29 Yeah, a voicemailer made it.
02:50:32 And I don't know who it was.
02:50:34 I don't know who made the new intro.
02:50:36 If you made the new intro, shout out to the comments.
02:50:41 I have a musical...
02:50:43 A PCP musical thing I've been doing for like a year,
02:50:46 but it's not done because it's been too busy.
02:50:48 We do?
02:50:49 Did you just let that rip?
02:50:51 You'll see it.
02:50:53 When I finish my current project,
02:50:55 I'm going to actually take time to finish it.
02:50:58 Wow.
02:51:00 Based.
02:51:02 Okay, sounds good.
02:51:04 Let's do the next voicemail.
02:51:06 It is called...
02:51:08 Horoscope.
02:51:10 Three, two, one, go.
02:51:13 Ben, you come off as earnest and considerate,
02:51:16 emotionally honest and wise enough to laugh at one's own.
02:51:19 Wise.
02:51:20 Your soft-spokenness and fiery virtuosity
02:51:22 paint you as compassionate and well-compassed.
02:51:24 I agree.
02:51:25 You're both guided by strong moral principles
02:51:27 and emotional intelligence.
02:51:29 You attract people who act in kind.
02:51:31 Do you agree with your horoscope?
02:51:34 No.
02:51:35 Was that me and Giz?
02:51:37 That was correct.
02:51:39 Well, Giz's not here.
02:51:43 Mine, what did they say?
02:51:45 I was like, compassionate.
02:51:47 All lies.
02:51:49 Something about like,
02:51:51 bleeding with emotional intelligence
02:51:53 and attracting people who are the same thing.
02:51:56 You're anti-sigma male.
02:51:59 They're saying you're like a sheep of Inu coin?
02:52:02 Yeah, yeah.
02:52:04 Oh, Elon Musk's a tweet about me
02:52:07 and I'm going to go to the moon.
02:52:09 Wait, wait.
02:52:11 Ernest, considerate,
02:52:13 emotionally honest,
02:52:15 wise enough to laugh at myself.
02:52:17 Ernest, considerate, emotionally honest,
02:52:19 wise enough to laugh at myself.
02:52:21 I would, okay.
02:52:23 Ernest, considerate, emotionally honest.
02:52:26 Unironically, I agree with all those things
02:52:28 and I think they're all true of me.
02:52:30 I don't care how that sounds.
02:52:33 You know, emotionally honest in the sense that
02:52:35 I don't know if you're wise enough to laugh at yourself.
02:52:37 I feel like you just didn't have a choice.
02:52:39 You had to save face.
02:52:41 You're honest in that you'll tell someone
02:52:43 that they're fucking stupid
02:52:45 without hesitation because you believe it.
02:52:47 Exactly, exactly.
02:52:49 That is definitely true.
02:52:51 I don't mean to sound conceited.
02:52:53 I'm just giving you my Ernest opinion.
02:52:55 I'm just,
02:52:57 my honest,
02:52:59 my emotionally honest response to this
02:53:01 is to say that, yeah, I think it's all true.
02:53:03 I guess we've learned today that horoscopes are real.
02:53:05 Yeah, that's right.
02:53:07 Shit.
02:53:09 A lesson I learned over and over again,
02:53:11 but I always fail to internalize.
02:53:13 People say that
02:53:15 crypto is horoscopes for men
02:53:17 and so are horoscopes.
02:53:19 Crypto is essential oils for men.
02:53:23 And NFTs are
02:53:25 multi-level marketing schemes for men.
02:53:27 And
02:53:29 Sigma Male Grants sets over
02:53:31 horoscopes.
02:53:33 Tesla stock is
02:53:35 horoscopes for men
02:53:37 and
02:53:39 the
02:53:41 blockchain is
02:53:43 makeup?
02:53:45 I don't know.
02:53:47 How do the Grants sets fit in though?
02:53:49 That's gotta be one of the things.
02:53:51 I would have said that was horoscopes
02:53:53 because it's all about your personality, man.
02:53:55 You're not an asshole.
02:53:57 You're just really smart
02:53:59 and people don't understand you.
02:54:01 You're too smart to care about people's feelings.
02:54:03 You're special.
02:54:05 You're not an asshole.
02:54:07 You're just so intelligent and no one understands you.
02:54:09 That's correct. Thank you.
02:54:11 You're right. What's your point?
02:54:13 Sigma.
02:54:15 What's your point in saying these things about me?
02:54:17 Okay.
02:54:19 Next voicemail.
02:54:21 The next voicemail
02:54:23 is another image.
02:54:25 So let's see it.
02:54:27 Tech had to go do some shit,
02:54:29 but maybe he'll be back.
02:54:31 Oh, Bencore.
02:54:35 Oh boy.
02:54:37 Yeah.
02:54:39 These are all things that you've talked about in one way or another.
02:54:41 Wait, what is...
02:54:45 I wouldn't go so far as to say that
02:54:47 Golden Girls is Bencore.
02:54:51 Gold Ghost is great.
02:54:53 What are you fucking...
02:54:55 I just mean you're old, Ben. That's all it means.
02:54:57 Yeah.
02:54:59 It's just a coincidence that the picture is from Golden Girls.
02:55:01 Correct.
02:55:03 They were just pictures of an old person at doctor with health problems.
02:55:05 So this is great.
02:55:09 Maybe it's not Golden Girls.
02:55:11 Maybe it's more specifically Be Offer.
02:55:13 I don't know.
02:55:15 No, I was talking last episode about...
02:55:17 Or maybe two episodes ago about the Golden Girls.
02:55:19 But I like that
02:55:21 their Simpsons is also
02:55:23 the old people.
02:55:25 So there's a message here.
02:55:27 I don't know if these are Bencore.
02:55:29 So much as these are just things that I like.
02:55:31 I mean, Homestuck is pretty Bencore.
02:55:33 I would maybe say J.D.
02:55:35 I'm trying to work out...
02:55:37 Some of these are Bencore.
02:55:39 Do you know what the one in the middle right is?
02:55:41 Yeah, Oolulia.
02:55:43 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:55:45 Elemental Masters, yeah.
02:55:47 I've not read Elemental Masters,
02:55:49 but I know it's very granular.
02:55:51 It's magic system.
02:55:53 I was...
02:55:55 I was talking...
02:55:57 I wanted to get Nick to let me do
02:55:59 the audiobook version and let us upload
02:56:01 an audiobook to Audible.
02:56:03 And he was down.
02:56:05 He said he would let me do it.
02:56:07 But then when it came time for him to
02:56:09 just fill out the form,
02:56:11 giving them permission to sell his book,
02:56:13 just put in his
02:56:15 payment information
02:56:17 to be a person who uses Audible.
02:56:19 He just wouldn't do it.
02:56:21 He was just like...
02:56:23 I don't know if he was just lazy,
02:56:25 or if he was like, phobic of
02:56:27 anything that Google owns.
02:56:29 That might have been it, actually,
02:56:31 because he said he would not
02:56:33 look at Facebook, because it was like...
02:56:35 No, wait, Facebook is not owned by Google.
02:56:37 He's phobic
02:56:39 of Google stuff, though, so...
02:56:41 Alright.
02:56:43 Amazon owns Audible.
02:56:45 He doesn't like alphabet
02:56:47 or operation.
02:56:49 Maybe it was...
02:56:51 I don't know. Maybe he was just lazy.
02:56:53 The point is we could have made some money,
02:56:55 and we didn't do it.
02:56:57 And it's his fault.
02:56:59 What?
02:57:01 If we
02:57:03 cracked Jeff Bezos' head
02:57:05 like an egg yolk would come out.
02:57:07 Yeah.
02:57:09 I think it's only one way to find out.
02:57:11 I think like a chick would come out.
02:57:13 We'll take an axe to it.
02:57:15 We'll find him.
02:57:19 Long story short, as you were denied
02:57:21 the rank of Elemental Master.
02:57:23 I was.
02:57:25 I was so...
02:57:27 I was so hyped for it. I honestly was really hyped for it.
02:57:29 And then he...
02:57:31 He betrayed me.
02:57:33 He hurt me.
02:57:35 I was owed. I was owed this.
02:57:37 And he robbed it from me.
02:57:39 And now I'm out for revenge.
02:57:41 After I destroy Trixie...
02:57:45 Oh, Lillia's next.
02:57:47 Oh.
02:57:49 Okay.
02:57:51 The next voicemail is this image.
02:57:53 This Lynchian Alignment chart.
02:57:57 An academic definition of Lynchian
02:57:59 might be that the term refers to a particular
02:58:01 kind of irony with a very macabre and very mundane
02:58:03 combined in such a way as to reveal
02:58:05 the former's perpetual containment
02:58:07 within the latter.
02:58:09 Hmm.
02:58:11 Okay.
02:58:13 Only film TV.
02:58:15 Okay, form can be any art.
02:58:17 Form, rebel, anything. Okay, that's simple enough.
02:58:19 Content purist.
02:58:21 The mundane refers to regular plain Americana
02:58:23 and the macabre refers
02:58:25 to strange psychosexual violence.
02:58:27 Content centrist. The mundane refers
02:58:29 to any sense of normalcy and the macabre
02:58:31 anything creepy.
02:58:33 Content, rebel. Okay, it doesn't have to be
02:58:35 that normal or that creepy.
02:58:37 So play...
02:58:39 Pizza...
02:58:41 Pizza bait, papa?
02:58:43 I don't even know what that is.
02:58:45 So it's an idea that there is a certain
02:58:47 sinister undertone even in
02:58:49 very mundane
02:58:51 concepts.
02:58:53 What is pizza bait, papa?
02:58:55 Or pizza. I'm just trying to work out how...
02:58:57 Is it just a pizza with a chicken on it?
02:58:59 I'm just trying to work out how...
02:59:01 I mean, I guess that isn't normal
02:59:03 or creepy.
02:59:05 I guess it kind of fits the content rebel definition.
02:59:07 I would say a pizza is relatively normal.
02:59:09 There's something abnormal about the pizza.
02:59:11 I would say
02:59:13 by these definitions where form rebel means
02:59:15 the medium can be anything
02:59:17 and content rebel means it doesn't really
02:59:19 even need to be normal or creepy.
02:59:21 Yeah, literally anything is lynchian
02:59:23 by that definition.
02:59:25 So sure, maybe it's just a pizza.
02:59:27 Maybe.
02:59:29 Yeah, I'm just thinking by this term
02:59:31 the universe itself is macabre
02:59:33 and there's an irony
02:59:35 within the mundanity by which we experience
02:59:37 and get used to it.
02:59:39 I mean,
02:59:41 DFW's definition up here
02:59:43 is referring to...
02:59:45 He's referring to something that is
02:59:47 evoked in media
02:59:49 where you bring these two ideas together
02:59:51 to suggest something
02:59:53 but you're suggesting something
02:59:55 about the real world.
02:59:57 So it seems a bit
02:59:59 off base to point to something
03:00:01 that really exists.
03:00:03 Which yes, of course the macabre
03:00:05 is contained within the mundane.
03:00:07 That's why the lynchian
03:00:09 paradigm is compelling
03:00:11 because that's how real life is.
03:00:13 So just point to something in real life
03:00:15 and be like, oh, it's lynchian.
03:00:17 It's like, well, no.
03:00:19 Lynchian things just refer
03:00:21 to the same phenomenon.
03:00:23 They just evoke the phenomenon that exists
03:00:25 in reality, in media.
03:00:27 So you've gone off base.
03:00:29 You've lost your mind.
03:00:31 Where does dry dump December
03:00:33 fit on the lynchian
03:00:35 line?
03:00:37 When someone's taking a dump,
03:00:39 you know how you see stars
03:00:41 sometimes if you push really hard?
03:00:43 Those stars will start dancing
03:00:45 and there'll be some nice
03:00:47 jazz music playing.
03:00:49 I would say, okay.
03:00:51 Do you know the context behind this picture
03:00:53 of David Lynch and the Woody Woodpecker dolls?
03:00:57 Yeah, he rescued them.
03:00:59 Yes, dude.
03:01:01 Oh, no.
03:01:03 In the lynchian line, this black and white photo,
03:01:05 he's sitting on a sofa with like
03:01:07 five Woody Woodpecker dolls.
03:01:09 There's a video. I'm linking the video.
03:01:11 This is one of my favorite videos ever.
03:01:15 Okay.
03:01:17 And Snake knows it.
03:01:19 Is it as good as
03:01:21 David Lynch cooks quinoa?
03:01:23 Ben, it's better.
03:01:25 No way.
03:01:27 See, here's the thing.
03:01:29 I think there's nothing macabre about it.
03:01:31 It's potentially macabre,
03:01:33 but the macabre has been denied.
03:01:35 Well, here's the thing, Snake,
03:01:37 is that there's a follow-up to this video
03:01:39 where he talks about
03:01:41 this video in an interview he did once,
03:01:43 where he
03:01:45 ends talking
03:01:47 about these Woody Woodpecker dolls
03:01:49 with, they're not in my life anymore.
03:01:51 Oh, okay.
03:01:55 I forgot about, yeah,
03:01:57 I said it just very vaguely in an interview.
03:01:59 They're not in my life anymore.
03:02:01 With no elucidation.
03:02:03 Like, what did they do to him?
03:02:05 Oh, I love, I love
03:02:07 any chance
03:02:09 I get to link this fucking
03:02:11 David Lynch Woody Woodpecker video.
03:02:13 Yeah, the pin drop,
03:02:15 the shoe, the other shoe.
03:02:19 Something, something macabre,
03:02:21 something, something.
03:02:23 Dried up, dried up December.
03:02:25 Okay, my question is,
03:02:27 if he is
03:02:29 participating in an event like dried up December,
03:02:31 no November, is that a form of art,
03:02:33 that participation?
03:02:35 Or does that count as anything?
03:02:37 I am of the games or art crowd,
03:02:39 I think art is a very
03:02:41 broad thing where if it's meant to
03:02:43 star an emotion in you,
03:02:45 then it can qualify.
03:02:47 Something being bad doesn't mean it's not art,
03:02:49 it means it's bad art.
03:02:51 I agree. Yeah, and
03:02:53 that's your argument that
03:02:55 dried up December is art.
03:02:57 It's not just art, it's a movement.
03:02:59 A bowel movement, if you will.
03:03:01 I'm gonna disagree, because
03:03:03 I think that the creation
03:03:05 of dried up December
03:03:07 obviously was inspired
03:03:09 and is a work of art.
03:03:11 Dried up December as a concept is a work of art.
03:03:13 Merely participating in dried up December,
03:03:15 merely
03:03:17 executing upon
03:03:19 the ideas contained within,
03:03:21 I don't think I would call that art.
03:03:23 I would call that
03:03:25 performance art.
03:03:27 I think that's contributing to
03:03:29 the, I mean, I guess that's the
03:03:31 separation between art and artist, right?
03:03:33 You're not an artist
03:03:35 when you play a video game.
03:03:37 You're an artist when you make a video game.
03:03:39 I don't know, I've never seen my videos.
03:03:41 When you design the game.
03:03:43 You participate
03:03:45 in the game that you play,
03:03:47 but you don't
03:03:49 make art by playing a video game.
03:03:51 You participate in art that someone else made.
03:03:53 I don't know.
03:03:55 I think dried up December
03:03:57 is a distinct and new
03:03:59 from these
03:04:01 terms.
03:04:03 If you make
03:04:05 a let's play, that could be
03:04:07 considered art.
03:04:09 If you're doing dried up December, you have to
03:04:11 catalog the process.
03:04:13 If you publicly perform it and you
03:04:15 catalog it, then of course.
03:04:17 I do just want to actually say
03:04:19 for sake of
03:04:21 let's plays as art.
03:04:23 If you've ever seen Sonic 2 Special Edition,
03:04:25 that is art.
03:04:27 That's some old, something awful.
03:04:29 Sonic 2 Special Edition.
03:04:31 Is this text LP shit?
03:04:33 It's not text LP.
03:04:35 It's an absolutely hilarious
03:04:37 let's play that kind of builds on
03:04:39 the old jokes about just how much cut content
03:04:41 there was in Sonic 2.
03:04:43 It just kind of builds on that
03:04:45 into an absurdist joke where the game just
03:04:47 gradually breaks down
03:04:49 and the edits get more and more absurdist.
03:04:51 At one point, a level
03:04:53 just is played like memento
03:04:55 essentially.
03:04:57 Is it this?
03:04:59 I believe so.
03:05:01 I watched it on the LP archive
03:05:03 years and years ago.
03:05:05 I'll give this a watch. This looks right.
03:05:07 Yeah.
03:05:09 I'm trying to remember the name
03:05:11 of the guy who made it. I still follow him on Twitter.
03:05:13 He's still around. He just doesn't do LP stuff anymore.
03:05:15 Doc Future?
03:05:17 Doc Future. Yes. This is the guy.
03:05:19 Yeah.
03:05:33 Interesting. Alright. I'll give this a watch.
03:05:35 This sounds cool.
03:05:37 Yeah. It's a fun old LP
03:05:39 and kind of something awful.
03:05:41 I think that's actually where I got a lot of my
03:05:43 old weird internet
03:05:45 sensibilities that have steadily dropped away.
03:05:47 Is this where I count?
03:05:49 Yup. There'd be Doc Future.
03:05:53 Interesting.
03:05:55 Fascinating.
03:05:57 I really like really
03:05:59 something awful LP's where people would get
03:06:01 really
03:06:03 creative with it.
03:06:05 Put them on blue.
03:06:07 Oh yeah.
03:06:09 I have enjoyed your video series.
03:06:11 Thank you.
03:06:13 This isn't...
03:06:15 Is this the guy?
03:06:17 Oh wait. This is the guy behind Petscop?
03:06:19 No. No. The guy
03:06:21 who uploaded the video did a
03:06:23 or like he was basically
03:06:25 describing the series.
03:06:27 Because this is a reupload. He said,
03:06:29 think a more comedic version of Petscop.
03:06:31 I misspoke.
03:06:33 I thought I recognized the name
03:06:35 and I thought maybe...
03:06:37 I made Petscop his name as
03:06:39 Tony.
03:06:41 I think it's just Twitter app.
03:06:43 This is just for me
03:06:45 and maybe tech, but I've just noticed
03:06:47 the uploader's name is Mike Dawson
03:06:49 and now I'm wondering if this is a
03:06:51 Retsuit Pre-reference
03:06:53 the uploader of Sonic 2.
03:06:55 Is that the name of...
03:06:57 Mike Dawson is the guy from
03:06:59 Darkseed.
03:07:01 While I'm just going off
03:07:03 of weird trivia, the guy who wrote
03:07:05 Sonic 2, Benson also
03:07:07 wrote the Metal Gear Solid 1
03:07:09 novelization, which is awful.
03:07:11 That's insane.
03:07:13 That's the one that canonizes
03:07:15 Snake as a dog musher.
03:07:17 Yeah.
03:07:19 What?
03:07:21 Is it actually bad?
03:07:23 No. I actually can't say with 100%
03:07:25 certainty whether that's the case.
03:07:27 I think Metal Gear Solid 1 itself
03:07:29 does allude to the fact that Snake
03:07:31 was taking part in the idea of a rod.
03:07:33 Yeah.
03:07:35 A dog musher. I actually don't know
03:07:37 if that's the correct term. Basically
03:07:39 he retired
03:07:41 from the military
03:07:43 or whatever and he went to Alaska
03:07:45 to
03:07:47 mush dogs.
03:07:49 Slay dogs.
03:07:51 Thank you.
03:07:53 When you crack the whip and you go
03:07:55 mush, mush.
03:07:57 Oh yeah, right.
03:07:59 The briefing mission.
03:08:01 The fucking dogs.
03:08:03 I forgot Roy.
03:08:05 You bastard.
03:08:07 I didn't watch that when I first
03:08:09 played the game. I watched it later
03:08:11 and I was like, holy shit. Roy sucks.
03:08:13 I get that it's
03:08:15 desperate, but still.
03:08:17 That's a pretty crazy first impression.
03:08:19 Metal Gear Solid is great.
03:08:21 Metal Gear Solid series.
03:08:23 A lot of fun.
03:08:25 A lot of fun, guy friends to kill dogs.
03:08:27 I've only played
03:08:29 the first one and I didn't even beat it
03:08:31 because I'm a fucking noob.
03:08:33 Well, you at least
03:08:35 watched the Mathematosis reviews, right?
03:08:37 Of course.
03:08:39 Of course.
03:08:41 I'll watch anything he puts out.
03:08:43 I'll play his fucking game too
03:08:45 whenever it's done.
03:08:47 Just to say I did.
03:08:49 I'll pay $10 for it
03:08:51 on Steam, but no more.
03:08:53 Next voicemail
03:08:55 is called
03:08:57 Voice Grail
03:08:59 3, 2, 1
03:09:01 Go.
03:09:03 Hello, it is me.
03:09:05 The golden bitch, Trixie.
03:09:07 Also known as Dark Gazers.
03:09:09 And since we're retroactively
03:09:11 voice grailing people,
03:09:13 I would like to nominate
03:09:15 Tommy J. for voice grail.
03:09:17 Thank you.
03:09:19 I really thought he was
03:09:21 going to nominate himself.
03:09:23 I didn't go where I was expecting.
03:09:25 I think, you know what?
03:09:27 You know what?
03:09:29 If the illustrious Doid Gazers
03:09:31 makes Trixie the golden bitch.
03:09:33 If he makes Trixie the golden bitch.
03:09:35 If he makes Trixie the golden bitch.
03:09:37 I was going to say we'll do it
03:09:39 if he wants us to, but no, you're right.
03:09:41 No, he's going to sing for us.
03:09:43 Sing for us.
03:09:45 Dance slave.
03:09:47 Dance slave.
03:09:49 Snake is BRB.
03:09:51 We can
03:09:53 listen to the next one.
03:09:55 Well, he's gone. It is called
03:09:57 Your Gay.
03:09:59 LeMau.
03:10:01 As in the letters, U-R-G-A-Y.
03:10:03 Here we go.
03:10:05 3, 2, 1, Go.
03:10:07 You guys are
03:10:09 shitting on crypto and bitcoin all the time.
03:10:11 And it's
03:10:13 getting infuriating.
03:10:15 I mean, just think about this.
03:10:17 If you would put $500
03:10:19 bitcoin one month ago,
03:10:21 today you'd have $300.
03:10:23 Think about that.
03:10:25 True.
03:10:27 He's going to love this one.
03:10:29 On a long enough timeline,
03:10:31 on a long enough timeline,
03:10:33 the value of every investment
03:10:35 is zero.
03:10:37 Think about it.
03:10:39 Really think about it.
03:10:41 Really mull it over.
03:10:43 Buy gold.
03:10:45 Buy gold. It's the only truly safe asset.
03:10:47 No, you want to buy silver.
03:10:49 It's going to go up.
03:10:51 Don't worry.
03:10:53 Actually, you want to buy copper?
03:10:55 Actually, because it's
03:10:57 like silver, but it's heavier,
03:10:59 so it's harder for them to steal
03:11:01 your value.
03:11:03 And it'll always be valuable.
03:11:05 Yeah.
03:11:07 Steal other people's copper.
03:11:09 How about that?
03:11:11 Steal would be a pretty good asset.
03:11:13 Maybe we can get our hands on some of that.
03:11:15 It's pretty valuable in Dwarf Fortress.
03:11:17 It's like the most valuable metal.
03:11:19 Aside from Adamantium, obviously.
03:11:21 Obviously.
03:11:23 Aside from Adamantium, obviously.
03:11:25 All right.
03:11:27 Next voicemail
03:11:29 is called
03:11:31 I'll be a little embarrassed if we get to the end of these
03:11:33 and we end the episode.
03:11:35 Snake is still gone.
03:11:37 We have to sheepishly explain.
03:11:39 Episode ended while you were away.
03:11:41 Sorry.
03:11:43 Yeah, next time.
03:11:45 Okay, this one is called
03:11:47 Penny Packer.
03:11:49 Okay.
03:11:51 Three, two, one, go.
03:11:53 Sup, guys.
03:11:55 I was just watching VTubers
03:11:57 and my friend told me to leave a message.
03:11:59 I haven't watched this
03:12:01 or listened to this podcast
03:12:03 for like two years.
03:12:05 I just want to say
03:12:07 Ben is gay.
03:12:09 Hippo used to be pretty cool.
03:12:11 He's just a little cool now.
03:12:13 And Nate
03:12:15 Well, Nate doesn't even exist.
03:12:17 See ya.
03:12:19 That was a great voicemail.
03:12:21 Damn. 10 out of 10.
03:12:23 That was...
03:12:25 That was appreciate the misgendering.
03:12:27 I can't believe I've been gaslit by Nate.
03:12:29 Yeah.
03:12:31 Well, not by Nate.
03:12:33 Yeah.
03:12:35 Everyone's been gaslit by Nate.
03:12:37 Oh.
03:12:39 Everyone was gaslit
03:12:41 when he said he was going to make
03:12:43 Best Anime Ever
03:12:45 Ghost in the Shell
03:12:47 Ghost in the Shell
03:12:49 And then he gaslit us all
03:12:51 with that video about the movie.
03:12:53 And then he said,
03:12:55 No, you're crazy.
03:12:57 That's the video, guys.
03:12:59 He said, why?
03:13:01 Why?
03:13:03 Okay.
03:13:05 So, that's...
03:13:07 Uh...
03:13:09 Nate fans?
03:13:11 I don't know. I don't trust them.
03:13:13 I don't trust them.
03:13:15 They don't trust themselves.
03:13:17 Yeah.
03:13:19 It looks like I'm missing the next voicemail
03:13:21 for some reason, but I will get it
03:13:23 really quick.
03:13:25 Why is it not in my...
03:13:27 What does it mean to be the best anime ever?
03:13:29 What does it mean to be that?
03:13:31 I mean, the deal with Nate Stick,
03:13:33 you know, it was sort of self-consciously
03:13:35 like, uh, you know.
03:13:37 He makes a Best Anime Ever video
03:13:39 about multiple different
03:13:41 animes. You can have multiple different
03:13:43 Best Anime Ever.
03:13:45 It's just whatever you feel.
03:13:47 There's no rules.
03:13:49 What does it mean to me?
03:13:51 This isn't a question for anyone else.
03:13:53 This is me putting my thoughts out.
03:13:55 I want your 5 paragraph essay
03:13:57 on what makes the Best Anime Ever
03:13:59 to you on my desk by next Thursday.
03:14:01 We famously discussed
03:14:03 the question of the best game ever
03:14:05 on the very first episode
03:14:07 of this podcast, and we came to the irrefutable
03:14:09 conclusion that Undertale
03:14:11 is, in fact, the best game ever.
03:14:13 Ah, yes. The most beloved 7 out of 10
03:14:15 ever made.
03:14:17 Uh-oh.
03:14:19 Savage.
03:14:21 Cruel.
03:14:23 The most beloved 7 out of 10 ever made
03:14:25 is definitely Dark Cloud
03:14:27 for...
03:14:29 I've got to admit some of my own
03:14:31 uh...
03:14:33 Not cagey-ness.
03:14:35 I've made that joke about Dark Souls,
03:14:37 but I just undercut my own opinions for an easy jab,
03:14:39 and I will do that at a moment's notice.
03:14:41 I believe that about Dark Souls, and ironically,
03:14:43 and we'll stand by that.
03:14:45 No, I actually do.
03:14:47 I don't actually believe in number grades.
03:14:49 I've never finished Dark Souls, because I just always get bored
03:14:51 when I get to Anor Londo,
03:14:53 and I'm like, I've had my fill.
03:14:55 I'm done.
03:14:57 I beat Dark Souls, but I did get bored
03:14:59 partway through number two.
03:15:01 Two is terrible.
03:15:03 I got to the Royal Rat Authority
03:15:05 and was like, I'm done with this fucking game.
03:15:07 I did beat the Royal Rat Authority.
03:15:09 And it's like, these controls
03:15:11 are unbearably bad,
03:15:13 even compared to the first time I went out.
03:15:15 I really tried to stick with it.
03:15:17 I really gave it a shot.
03:15:19 Um...
03:15:21 I don't know, I just never got the satisfaction
03:15:23 I felt other people were really, like,
03:15:25 clamoring from it.
03:15:27 Same.
03:15:29 It really makes me sad,
03:15:31 because the reason I powered through Dark Souls one
03:15:33 is I wanted to have that epiphany
03:15:35 and come out on the other side getting it,
03:15:37 and I just never did.
03:15:39 There's kind of...
03:15:41 This is a kind of okay
03:15:43 hack and slash with
03:15:45 sort of grim setting,
03:15:47 and it's like, I don't know, this stuff has existed
03:15:49 for years already.
03:15:51 I think part of the appeal
03:15:53 of something like a Dark Souls
03:15:55 or a Demon Souls is that,
03:15:57 like, while
03:15:59 from software it was making it,
03:16:01 it was very obvious that they knew
03:16:03 or that they didn't think it was going to be
03:16:05 this huge fucking phenomenon,
03:16:07 it just feels like a pretty
03:16:09 niche game that somehow
03:16:11 managed to come out.
03:16:13 There's nothing about it that stands out as
03:16:15 like, oh, this is a revolution in gaming,
03:16:17 clearly.
03:16:19 It's just really good.
03:16:21 I suppose I should really balance the elements.
03:16:23 I suppose I should walk back a little
03:16:25 just so I'm not just being
03:16:27 contrarian, because that's not what I'm trying to do.
03:16:29 I think it's just, it came out when
03:16:31 there was a big discussion on
03:16:33 AAA games that are too easy
03:16:35 and it
03:16:37 right place at the right time.
03:16:39 That's very true.
03:16:41 Definitely, definitely.
03:16:43 And it's like, right place at the right time, it was refreshing
03:16:45 for that, but I've been
03:16:47 like, oh, this is going to sound really arrogant,
03:16:49 and I apologize to anyone who takes it.
03:16:51 I've been playing weird jank PC games my whole life,
03:16:53 and it was, I don't know,
03:16:55 it was
03:16:57 interesting from the outside
03:16:59 in that regard.
03:17:01 Discussing difficulties always going to be kind of hard.
03:17:03 It's tricky, because
03:17:05 it's a tricky debate, because
03:17:07 everyone is at a different skill level.
03:17:09 There's no perfect baseline to
03:17:11 judge it from.
03:17:13 And I don't even think like, difficulty is
03:17:15 the interesting, well, people are
03:17:17 key to it nowadays, but it's like, difficulty
03:17:19 is being part of Dark Souls.
03:17:21 It's the tone and atmosphere.
03:17:23 If there wasn't like a hook
03:17:25 to push you through the difficulty, no one would
03:17:27 beat the game, you know?
03:17:29 It's like a nice oppressive
03:17:31 atmosphere, which I am, okay, just
03:17:33 tonally for myself, I'm not into like
03:17:35 really oppressive shit.
03:17:37 It's not really my jam, I guess.
03:17:41 You're a berserk snake.
03:17:43 I've tried, I want to,
03:17:45 I feel bad that I can't get into berserk.
03:17:47 Yeah, that's it.
03:17:49 Not even like the
03:17:51 first arc?
03:17:53 Oh, no. I'm really bad about
03:17:55 reading manga, like really bad.
03:17:57 And I kind of don't just want to watch the anime.
03:17:59 That is one I feel like
03:18:01 I've got to actually read this.
03:18:03 I finished two manga in my
03:18:05 I finished two manga in my life, and I can only remember one
03:18:07 of them, and it was Anna Satsushin,
03:18:09 which was a digestible read.
03:18:11 Unfortunately, none of us are ever going to finish berserk,
03:18:13 because Mira's dead, and it really
03:18:15 fucking sucks.
03:18:17 I don't read that much, but I did
03:18:19 manage to read all through the
03:18:21 like the first bit,
03:18:23 the first part of
03:18:25 berserk that everybody knows.
03:18:27 I mean, I have been saying that I'm
03:18:29 going to catch up on one piece for like three years
03:18:31 now, and I haven't done it.
03:18:33 The last chapter was really cool there.
03:18:35 You got so close at Radcon 4, and then you just fell off
03:18:37 the bandwagon again. Yeah, yeah.
03:18:39 Now I'll never fulfill the prophecy
03:18:41 of appearing on an episode, the podcast.
03:18:43 I
03:18:45 I did read
03:18:47 I read all of Death Note, I read all of
03:18:49 Bakuman.
03:18:51 Those are really good.
03:18:53 I read
03:18:55 You read Chainsaw Man?
03:18:57 I have not, but I
03:18:59 I kind of want it.
03:19:01 I've heard good things. I just don't
03:19:03 know anything about it other than that it's fucking dope.
03:19:05 It's a show, it's shown in action,
03:19:07 so if you like that,
03:19:09 I think it's probably one of the best
03:19:11 shows in action stories I've
03:19:13 read.
03:19:15 I kind of troll about
03:19:17 on the two best friends
03:19:19 subreddit a lot. It's actually a decent
03:19:21 place, and they love
03:19:23 Chainsaw Man, and they're like, okay, I gotta
03:19:25 read that at some point.
03:19:27 I read one chapter
03:19:29 while I was on my
03:19:31 break at work, and when I got home, I just
03:19:33 like I bingeed the entire run.
03:19:35 It's technically not done yet.
03:19:37 I was told it was done,
03:19:39 but it's just like only the first arc
03:19:41 is over, and it's just sound like hey,
03:19:43 this for now.
03:19:45 But what's out right now is
03:19:47 it's a complete story.
03:19:49 And it's
03:19:51 really good. It's like 90-something chapters.
03:19:53 Cool.
03:19:55 That's definitely dope.
03:19:57 Okay, stupid question.
03:19:59 Mob Psycho 100
03:20:01 was not a manga, right? It was just an anime.
03:20:03 No, it was
03:20:05 by the one punch man guy.
03:20:07 It was a webcomic? Yes.
03:20:09 No, wait.
03:20:11 And then it got mangled by
03:20:13 or is there only one punch man getting mangled by the guy you
03:20:15 did? I assume.
03:20:17 I know that happened to one punch man.
03:20:19 But I feel like
03:20:21 Mob Psycho
03:20:23 Sorry.
03:20:25 One punch man got really big,
03:20:27 but
03:20:29 I feel like
03:20:31 it was a direct to anime.
03:20:33 No.
03:20:35 I know the answer to this.
03:20:37 So one punch man was a webcomic first,
03:20:39 then it got redone as a manga
03:20:41 by a really good artist, then it got an anime adaptation.
03:20:43 By the time Mob Psycho
03:20:45 was started, the webcomic artist had gotten
03:20:47 a lot better, and they were able to just
03:20:49 do the manga themselves.
03:20:51 And then it also got an anime adaptation.
03:20:53 That's why the art style looks
03:20:55 a lot more like the webcomic style for one punch man.
03:20:59 I've not watched all of anime in recent years.
03:21:01 I fell a thing, but I am going to definitely
03:21:03 come back for Mob Psycho
03:21:05 Season 3.
03:21:07 I need to watch Mob Psycho.
03:21:09 I adore Mob Psycho.
03:21:11 I read a bunch of one punch man.
03:21:13 I
03:21:15 have not read or seen
03:21:17 Mob Psycho, but I saw
03:21:19 Alec Robbins, the Mr. Boot Guy.
03:21:21 I guess he just finished Mob Psycho,
03:21:23 and he said he loved it. He was gushing on Twitter.
03:21:25 He said it was amazing.
03:21:27 If he likes it, maybe I should read it.
03:21:29 I adore it because
03:21:31 it takes a similar theme
03:21:33 from one punch man of, you know,
03:21:35 this is the one person with these powers, but it puts it in a more
03:21:37 kind of juvenile finding oneself
03:21:39 perspective and not putting all
03:21:41 of your stock in powers you have, and
03:21:43 more the thing you want over the natural gifts
03:21:45 you've been given, and it's very heart
03:21:47 warming and very nice, and I really like it.
03:21:49 Let's see.
03:21:51 Yeah, that's...
03:21:53 I guess I've recently moved that onto
03:21:55 my shortlist.
03:21:57 You know what? I gotta admit
03:21:59 I'm not really sure what you're saying.
03:22:01 The other day,
03:22:03 everyone was telling me to watch OddTaxi,
03:22:05 and I said, no, fuck you.
03:22:07 But then the other day
03:22:09 at Friends Giving, I was at Munchie's
03:22:11 house, and somebody put on OddTaxi,
03:22:13 and I watched one episode of it, and I was like,
03:22:15 oh, I'm kind of intrigued.
03:22:17 Maybe I should watch three of those.
03:22:19 I watched one...
03:22:21 The one episode, I think it was the first episode,
03:22:23 and it seemed pretty good, so...
03:22:25 And I was immediately
03:22:27 like, okay, you know what? Everyone that said
03:22:29 this is a Ben sort of thing,
03:22:31 they were absolutely right. This is exactly
03:22:33 the kind of thing that I would like.
03:22:35 So...
03:22:37 That's not a guarantee that I'll actually watch it,
03:22:39 because I'm lazy about watching things, even things that I like.
03:22:41 But we'll see.
03:22:43 Yeah.
03:22:45 LaMau.
03:22:47 Next one?
03:22:49 That was a good episode of GamerZone, we just did.
03:22:51 Was that an episode of GamerZone?
03:22:53 We talked about games and anime.
03:22:55 I'm assuming that's what GamerZone is.
03:22:57 Oh.
03:22:59 Sure, sure.
03:23:01 We should call this podcast the GamerZone.
03:23:03 The Gaming Zone.
03:23:05 Gaming.
03:23:07 The Gaming Zone.
03:23:09 Next voicemail.
03:23:11 No!
03:23:13 Shut up!
03:23:15 You can't...
03:23:17 The Bone Zone is the Undertale podcast.
03:23:19 That's our Undertale side story.
03:23:21 Oh, goddammit.
03:23:23 GamerZone only. NSFW.
03:23:25 Next voicemail.
03:23:27 No!
03:23:29 Next voicemail is called...
03:23:31 Wait, no, that's the wrong one.
03:23:33 I think you posted this one.
03:23:35 I think this is the wrong one.
03:23:37 What the fuck?
03:23:41 Why are these all out of order?
03:23:43 This man does not have his voicemails together.
03:23:45 The show's over, we did it.
03:23:47 This man doesn't...
03:23:49 Show me a man, I will show you someone
03:23:51 who doesn't have his voicemails.
03:23:53 Here's the real one, sorry.
03:23:55 This one is called Clarification.
03:23:57 3, 2, 1, go.
03:23:59 I have...
03:24:01 Bipolar...
03:24:03 This is so hard.
03:24:05 This is the same one as last time.
03:24:07 Wait, we've heard this.
03:24:09 Yeah.
03:24:11 You already posted this one, Ben.
03:24:13 Yeah, this was the file you posted just a second ago.
03:24:15 Yeah.
03:24:17 You really rattled today.
03:24:19 Okay, sorry, sorry.
03:24:21 Okay, no, this is it.
03:24:23 This one is called Clarification.
03:24:25 3, 2, 1, go.
03:24:27 I just wanted to clear this up.
03:24:29 When I say you guys in a voicemail,
03:24:31 I am speaking to Ben
03:24:33 and presumably a guest
03:24:35 and or Tom if he's there.
03:24:37 I am in fact not referring to Gib
03:24:39 because I do not speak to women.
03:24:41 Yes!
03:24:43 Yes!
03:24:45 Excellent!
03:24:47 You've got his priority straight.
03:24:49 Good man.
03:24:51 The American people are tired of women.
03:24:53 Tired of women.
03:24:55 Women!
03:24:57 Good for you.
03:24:59 You can never misgender
03:25:01 if you don't acknowledge
03:25:03 their existence
03:25:05 ever.
03:25:07 That's a lesson in that.
03:25:09 Just the facts.
03:25:11 Just the facts, sir, just the facts.
03:25:13 And by sir,
03:25:15 there's no one here.
03:25:17 All assembled.
03:25:19 Next one,
03:25:21 and this is the real...
03:25:23 I swear I'm going to do it right this time.
03:25:25 Next one is called Timmy's Big USA Adventure.
03:25:27 3, 2, 1, go.
03:25:29 3, 2, 1, go.
03:25:31 3, 2, 1, go.
03:25:33 Oh my lord!
03:25:35 I do have to say
03:25:37 hearing Ben talk about the creator's satisfaction
03:25:39 he finds in creating Phantom Worms
03:25:41 revenge really warms my heart.
03:25:43 Thanks man.
03:25:45 When you work really brings
03:25:47 all the themes and emotional beach
03:25:49 out in mind to fruition
03:25:51 it's a beautiful thing.
03:25:53 Now, just to by road
03:25:55 to Radcon straight from his doorstep
03:25:57 to fulfill my parasocial fantasy.
03:25:59 Let me see here.
03:26:01 By road to Radcon.
03:26:03 Hey sir, is this bus coming
03:26:05 anytime soon?
03:26:07 No?
03:26:09 Why do they keep around these boards
03:26:11 to leave bus times?
03:26:13 It's hard enough to find a stop.
03:26:15 Well,
03:26:17 let me just take a subway then.
03:26:19 Wait.
03:26:21 An isekai to meet Ben Saint
03:26:23 in Rhapsody.
03:26:25 You mean in America they close perfectly good subway lines?
03:26:27 Just to force people to take the car?
03:26:29 Damn you city planners!
03:26:31 Just admit it!
03:26:33 How far do the car companies have their hands
03:26:35 off your ass?
03:26:37 How many fingers are they sticking up?
03:26:39 Fuck this!
03:26:41 I'm going back to Europe!
03:26:43 At least stock and give can be done by public transport.
03:26:47 I don't want to encourage shawking.
03:26:49 I do like the point that yes,
03:26:51 our public transport infrastructure
03:26:53 is just bangin'.
03:26:55 Like that pride I can take in that.
03:26:57 The whole country is shit
03:26:59 but we can get anywhere in it.
03:27:01 If your country wasn't such a
03:27:03 piddly little
03:27:05 such a miserable tiny little island
03:27:07 then
03:27:09 you say it's piddly and little
03:27:11 I say it's focused.
03:27:13 We would have high speed rail
03:27:15 all over our country if we were tiny.
03:27:17 That's all I'm saying.
03:27:19 There's nowhere to even go.
03:27:21 Maybe you shouldn't have settled
03:27:23 on such a big lion mess.
03:27:25 It was our destiny
03:27:27 and we were manifesting it.
03:27:29 Thank you and good night.
03:27:31 The only thing tiny about America
03:27:33 is our consideration for the working class
03:27:35 and we're damn proud of it.
03:27:37 Come on, don't pretend English.
03:27:39 I thought you were going to mention
03:27:41 my penis.
03:27:43 I figured we all knew that by now.
03:27:45 It seemed redundant.
03:27:47 So there's two things. Two things tiny
03:27:49 about America.
03:27:51 Ben, you're a traitor to America.
03:27:53 You don't count anymore.
03:27:55 Someone in America has to have the little dick.
03:27:57 It's just a law of nature.
03:27:59 Somebody. It's me.
03:28:01 I'm somebody.
03:28:03 I'm the burden for everybody else.
03:28:05 Somebody
03:28:07 in the earth has to do
03:28:09 the Christ-like sacrifice
03:28:11 of having the smallest dick in the world
03:28:13 so that everyone else can feel
03:28:15 better about themselves in comparison.
03:28:17 It's me. You're welcome.
03:28:19 I provide a public service.
03:28:21 This reminds me,
03:28:23 it was an interesting bit.
03:28:25 You guys watched Noah Caldwell-Gervais?
03:28:27 You know him? I love
03:28:29 Noah Caldwell-Gervais.
03:28:31 Did you see his new Forza video?
03:28:33 Yeah, I have watched that.
03:28:35 It's great. I'm not even a car guy.
03:28:37 No, me either.
03:28:39 And I know he's a car guy,
03:28:41 but he mentions
03:28:43 the bit about how
03:28:45 he has seen a lot of anti-car
03:28:47 sentiment grow.
03:28:49 He's a car guy, and I'm an anti-car guy.
03:28:51 And he said
03:28:53 it's been interesting watching anti-car
03:28:55 sentiment grow up around him in recent years.
03:28:57 And he kind of agrees with a lot of it.
03:28:59 But he's still a car guy.
03:29:01 He just loves cars.
03:29:03 And I don't know.
03:29:05 I guess I thought that was interesting.
03:29:07 I just thought that was interesting.
03:29:09 Maybe we'll get another watch.
03:29:11 I don't think it's quite cognitive dissonance
03:29:13 to just kind of understand the
03:29:15 ramifications of Caldwell.
03:29:17 But also just know
03:29:19 it's undeniably fun
03:29:21 to go fast in a car
03:29:23 and to enjoy the
03:29:25 engineering thing.
03:29:27 I hate that.
03:29:29 In that bit, he describes
03:29:31 the American dream
03:29:33 and how the car is
03:29:35 intertwined with the American dream
03:29:37 and the open road and the freedom to go anywhere.
03:29:39 In a country
03:29:41 that's as big and spread out as America,
03:29:43 car ownership is
03:29:45 the freedom to go
03:29:47 whenever you want.
03:29:49 That's fine. That's cool.
03:29:51 I do understand the appeal of that.
03:29:53 So like it's
03:29:57 I just think no is a cool guy.
03:29:59 I just thought that was interesting.
03:30:01 I would like to present
03:30:03 your statement that buses suck.
03:30:05 Maybe in America they do.
03:30:07 But America has shit public transport.
03:30:09 So not surprising.
03:30:11 Buses in New Zealand are fucking great.
03:30:13 They're clean. They're shiny.
03:30:15 They're modern and they're comfortable.
03:30:17 I would say this.
03:30:19 I won't say all buses are clean,
03:30:21 but I would say
03:30:23 the public infrastructure
03:30:25 we have and you find
03:30:27 the funniest, craziest people on the bus.
03:30:29 So got that going.
03:30:31 I don't like that.
03:30:33 Boston is basically
03:30:35 good.
03:30:37 Boston is one of the places
03:30:39 in America that does have
03:30:41 a workable public transit system.
03:30:43 So feeling blessed.
03:30:45 Feeling blessed.
03:30:47 Speaking of crazy people on the bus,
03:30:49 I went to high school and I took the bus
03:30:51 during the last couple of years of high school.
03:30:53 There was just this guy probably in his 30s
03:30:55 who was always on the bus.
03:30:57 He looked like he was permanently cracked out on meth.
03:30:59 He had the face of a rat.
03:31:01 His eyes were perfectly circular bulging out of his face.
03:31:03 Or was he messed out on crack?
03:31:05 He was one of those things.
03:31:07 Nobody knows.
03:31:09 He was one or both.
03:31:11 His eyes were red
03:31:13 and he had like a hook nose.
03:31:15 He looked like an NPC
03:31:17 in some medieval setting
03:31:19 who was like...
03:31:21 He hunched over with a hunch bank.
03:31:23 Yeah, please, sir, give me a fucking coin.
03:31:25 Was this an old man?
03:31:27 No, he was probably
03:31:29 like early 30s.
03:31:31 He just had that face.
03:31:33 He had that build.
03:31:35 He looked like a goblin of a man.
03:31:37 And he was on the bus
03:31:39 every single time in the same spot.
03:31:41 Wow.
03:31:43 But a couple of the kids
03:31:45 would be friendly with him
03:31:47 because they would just chat with him.
03:31:49 I say kids because I was
03:31:51 mid to late teens
03:31:53 and the kids were probably 11 or 12
03:31:55 but they were just friendly with him for whatever reason.
03:31:57 I was always concerned.
03:31:59 I'm like, no, maybe he's just a nice guy.
03:32:01 Why wouldn't you want to befriend the local goblin?
03:32:03 In New Zealand,
03:32:05 do you get
03:32:07 the school kids on the back of a bus
03:32:09 who are blasting tinny music out of their phones?
03:32:11 No.
03:32:13 Okay, that's a
03:32:15 a phenomena for England.
03:32:17 People have their headphones
03:32:19 in the middle school.
03:32:21 If you played music,
03:32:23 the bus driver would turn around and be like, oh, I stop it.
03:32:25 Oh, no, it wouldn't happen.
03:32:27 We have the double deck as it'd be upstairs
03:32:29 and just blasting
03:32:31 some kind of music.
03:32:33 It does not that it happens that often
03:32:35 but when it does happen that someone's
03:32:37 blasting music out of their phone,
03:32:39 it's not school kids that usually do it
03:32:41 or buses that I see.
03:32:43 It's usually just like some guy
03:32:45 or just some person.
03:32:47 Over here, it's always like a gaggle of secondary kids
03:32:49 which is
03:32:51 I mean, I guess they got to ride the bus home.
03:32:53 Gotta do something to entertain yourself.
03:32:55 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:32:59 I'm always surprised.
03:33:01 I'm always surprised to see a gang of school kids
03:33:03 get on the bus
03:33:05 because I rode the bus to school
03:33:07 but we had school buses.
03:33:09 They were like, oh yeah, in a city,
03:33:11 I guess you could just
03:33:13 sometimes just take the regular bus.
03:33:15 Why would they have new buses?
03:33:17 School buses aren't really a thing
03:33:19 in London unless...
03:33:21 They're not a thing either in New Zealand.
03:33:23 It's just for regular buses but we have them everywhere
03:33:25 running all the time,
03:33:27 every 30 to 15 minutes for the bus
03:33:29 at every stop all day around pretty much.
03:33:31 There will be a bus for
03:33:33 special needs kids
03:33:35 but besides that,
03:33:37 yeah, that makes sense.
03:33:41 Okay,
03:33:43 well, love
03:33:45 public transport, obviously.
03:33:47 It's good, that's great.
03:33:49 This is the last voicemail
03:33:51 is the next one, I think.
03:33:53 It's called, I know.
03:33:55 Not that many this week
03:33:57 in the grand scheme of things.
03:33:59 This one is called, Why Nate Still Loves Ben?
03:34:01 Three, two, one, go.
03:34:03 Well, yeah, you're right.
03:34:05 But I wasn't even talking about Ben.
03:34:07 Oh, I mean Ben, you know.
03:34:09 Ben would not
03:34:11 hold back his hand
03:34:13 when a woman's talking smack
03:34:15 and that's why I love him.
03:34:17 That's why he's still my brother.
03:34:19 Was this on the...
03:34:21 Any idea what this is from?
03:34:23 It sounds like it's from a stream.
03:34:25 I can hear like Pokemon music in the background
03:34:27 or something.
03:34:29 Ben would not hold back his hand
03:34:31 if it was...
03:34:33 That's why I love my brother.
03:34:35 That's kind of sweet, actually.
03:34:37 That's sweet in his relic-y way.
03:34:39 Into the dirt is what keeps us
03:34:41 related.
03:34:43 In his relic-y way, I appreciate it.
03:34:45 Honestly, that does warm my heart
03:34:47 a little bit.
03:34:49 What a sweetheart.
03:34:51 I mean, if it was serious...
03:34:53 If we're talking about serious smack,
03:34:55 then, you know,
03:34:57 like if a woman were to call me
03:34:59 say, a knife
03:35:01 or say that I had
03:35:03 Arger or Rargi
03:35:05 or some other form of dishonor like that,
03:35:07 then, if you watch...
03:35:09 If you listen to the Fun Fact Challenge
03:35:11 bonus episode, then you'll know
03:35:13 that Nate is correct.
03:35:15 You know what I would do to a woman
03:35:17 that said such a thing
03:35:19 as what anyone would do
03:35:21 or to anyone to protect my...
03:35:23 to protect my honor.
03:35:25 To protect the world from devastation.
03:35:27 Yes, yes.
03:35:31 Snake, do you know
03:35:33 what to do if someone
03:35:35 calls you a gay wizard?
03:35:39 What would you do in that fucked up situation?
03:35:41 Pray the gay away?
03:35:43 Which is don't pray.
03:35:45 An admirable effort,
03:35:47 but I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough.
03:35:49 I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough to save you.
03:35:51 I'm sorry.
03:35:53 I mean, yeah, I was wrong from the start.
03:35:55 It would be like a paladin thing.
03:35:57 A wizard wouldn't do pray.
03:35:59 You just got to accept the compliment
03:36:01 and move on with your day.
03:36:03 That's not the...
03:36:05 That's not the Nordic way.
03:36:07 Ben, they can actually say
03:36:09 what to do if you're called a gay wizard.
03:36:11 Otherwise, then there'd be no point
03:36:13 to subscribe to the Patreon
03:36:15 and listen to the Fun Fact Challenge.
03:36:17 Exactly! Guys, thank you so much
03:36:19 for playing along with the bit where you pretend
03:36:21 not to know what I'm talking about.
03:36:23 Yes.
03:36:25 I totally know.
03:36:27 I was just reaching into my D&D lore
03:36:29 which is how I understand history.
03:36:31 I know, I know.
03:36:33 I mean, those are my textbook.
03:36:35 That'll be the death of you.
03:36:37 That'll be the death of you.
03:36:39 The only history I need is right here.
03:36:41 I'd say patting my
03:36:43 second edition monsters manual.
03:36:45 Yeah.
03:36:49 One time, a long time ago,
03:36:51 I wanted to buy
03:36:53 my copy of the second edition
03:36:55 Rules Cyclopedia.
03:36:57 He was going to buy it from me for $200.
03:36:59 What?
03:37:01 And then I just forgot to get back to him.
03:37:03 You should message him right now
03:37:05 and be like, yeah, still got it
03:37:07 if you're interested.
03:37:09 I have a set of the
03:37:11 three years ago.
03:37:13 The D&D first edition
03:37:15 player's handbook,
03:37:17 Dungeon Masters' Guide in a Monster Manual.
03:37:19 It's like $20 from a friend.
03:37:21 I don't know what edition...
03:37:23 I'm not sure what edition the Rules Cyclopedia
03:37:25 is from.
03:37:27 Rules Cyclopedia...
03:37:29 I've been a...
03:37:31 not a D&D, I've been a tabletop guy
03:37:33 for about 10 years now
03:37:35 and I have genuinely never actually played D&D itself
03:37:37 just because I find it.
03:37:39 I don't...
03:37:41 Oh, you've played other games.
03:37:43 I've played games that focus more on the actual...
03:37:45 I prefer games that are lighter
03:37:47 and just focus more on the actual role-playing
03:37:49 and combat.
03:37:51 You would like 5e, then. 5e is definitely
03:37:53 Rules Light.
03:37:55 I haven't played that one yet.
03:37:57 I'm a Dungeon World guy.
03:37:59 Snake, have you done that one?
03:38:01 I bought the book for Dungeon World. I haven't played it yet.
03:38:03 It's a lot of fun.
03:38:05 There's a ton of custom classes for it, though.
03:38:07 The base ones are like fine.
03:38:09 Only meld them in if you're not getting enough
03:38:11 out of those base classes.
03:38:13 I just need friends so I can actually play
03:38:15 with people.
03:38:17 That's the big missing component right now.
03:38:19 Have you ever played Powered by the Apocalypse?
03:38:21 Snake?
03:38:23 Dungeon World is Powered by the Apocalypse.
03:38:25 Oh, right, right, right.
03:38:27 I have played Apocalypse World, which was the origin
03:38:29 of it, and I've played
03:38:31 Spirit of 77, which is a
03:38:33 7e's buddy cop show
03:38:35 kind of take on it, which is really fun.
03:38:37 It sounds very funny.
03:38:39 I played the tabletop game once.
03:38:41 I only did it one time, but it was fun.
03:38:43 It was Powered by the Apocalypse. It was
03:38:45 Monster of the Week, where it was basically
03:38:47 like...Gib would like this.
03:38:49 It's basically like Buffy,
03:38:51 where you solve
03:38:53 mysteries and fight monsters and stuff.
03:38:55 It's really...
03:38:57 I don't want to say low stakes, but it's not
03:38:59 very combat heavy because it's very easy
03:39:01 to get yourself killed.
03:39:03 Yeah, it's more about the investigation
03:39:05 and working out what the
03:39:07 Paranole thing is. I played one game of
03:39:09 Monster of the Week. It was really fun.
03:39:11 The leader
03:39:13 of the party, I say in quotes because it's just
03:39:15 thing, we did a gag party
03:39:17 where the guy leading it was basically
03:39:19 playing Ghost from True Capitalist Radio
03:39:21 if he was a Paranormal Investigator.
03:39:23 That's good.
03:39:25 He was just really pissed off and mad,
03:39:27 and I was his driver and bodyguard.
03:39:29 Oh, you were the engineer?
03:39:31 No, I wasn't engineer. I was Scott
03:39:33 Shelby from Heavy Rain, but even
03:39:35 Dumber. I was just like a fat
03:39:37 lumbering guy, just following him around.
03:39:39 And that was a really fun
03:39:41 session.
03:39:43 Yeah,
03:39:45 D&D is fun and all.
03:39:47 I made a video about
03:39:49 the piece of channel. I actually remember you bringing it up on an episode
03:39:51 of things you can't get into.
03:39:53 The classic.
03:39:55 Yeah, I'm very...
03:39:57 I always chafe and feel irritated
03:39:59 by all the
03:40:01 minutiae and the nitty-gritty of the rules
03:40:03 and stuff.
03:40:05 That's why I like Dungeon World because it gets out
03:40:07 of the way and it's very interpretive.
03:40:09 And also, I genuinely think
03:40:11 it's a problem of having the right group of people
03:40:13 who... and kind of knowing what
03:40:15 your rule there for what you want.
03:40:17 Because a good GM will like, if something's more fun,
03:40:19 the rules can maybe take a backseat.
03:40:21 The point of dice
03:40:23 roles are, you're just playing make-believe
03:40:25 if there isn't some skeleton to
03:40:27 like, oh, am I going to be able to
03:40:29 do this? Am I going to be able to...
03:40:31 That's the stakes of it.
03:40:33 It's about having the right
03:40:35 group and all knowing what you're there for.
03:40:37 There's a rules-light
03:40:39 RPG game that I found
03:40:41 and I thought it was really interesting
03:40:43 and I always wanted to DM a game of it
03:40:45 with the PCP.
03:40:47 I always wanted to do at a Radcon.
03:40:49 We could do a game of it and we never did.
03:40:51 The game is called Rises
03:40:53 and you have only one stat
03:40:55 and it's just your class.
03:40:57 But your class can be something
03:40:59 like vague.
03:41:01 It's like a...
03:41:03 This is like a fiction trope, something like
03:41:05 Damsel in Distress
03:41:07 or like
03:41:09 Viking Berserker or something.
03:41:11 It's just something...
03:41:13 And basically, anytime you want to do
03:41:15 something that someone of
03:41:17 your class might theoretically be able
03:41:19 to do, like if you're a Viking, maybe
03:41:21 barge down a door, or flip
03:41:23 a table, or chop
03:41:25 a tree down,
03:41:27 you can make a Viking check where Damsel in Distress
03:41:29 would be like, climb a rope down the
03:41:31 side of a castle, or
03:41:33 convince a noble of something
03:41:35 or something like that.
03:41:37 That's the only stat you check against
03:41:39 is the number of this class
03:41:41 but it's a nebulously defined class.
03:41:43 And I thought that was really neat
03:41:45 and I never got to play it.
03:41:47 But on the other side...
03:41:49 I have played
03:41:51 D&D before.
03:41:53 I played in regular D&D
03:41:55 like a third...
03:41:57 I played in third, fourth, and fifth edition.
03:41:59 Actually, when I was a kid, I played in second
03:42:01 edition too.
03:42:03 I'm looking at the character sheet for Rysus
03:42:05 and this is very interesting.
03:42:07 I thought it
03:42:09 sounded really neat and I never got to play it.
03:42:13 I would love to someday.
03:42:17 On the other hand...
03:42:19 I was...
03:42:21 I think I was just googling around for like rules, light
03:42:23 systems, and this was
03:42:25 the rules, lightest system I could find.
03:42:27 This was the most minimal one.
03:42:31 But on the other hand, there's another system
03:42:33 that I thought was really cool once upon a time.
03:42:35 I tried to run a game and it was very short lived.
03:42:37 Mutants & Masterminds
03:42:39 is the exact...
03:42:41 I don't know if you've ever tried to play it
03:42:43 but it's the exact opposite. Mutants & Masterminds
03:42:45 it's very free form
03:42:47 in that you can basically be whatever you want.
03:42:49 It's a super RPG where you can codify your own powers
03:42:51 and you can get very crazy with it.
03:42:53 Yes.
03:42:55 You can basically have whatever power...
03:42:57 What?
03:42:59 I've not played that one itself
03:43:01 but I do know the system because I...
03:43:03 I think a few years ago that one was on my brain
03:43:05 a bunch.
03:43:07 The interesting thing about it
03:43:09 is the way that it makes you able to do
03:43:11 basically anything you want. Your character can have
03:43:13 whatever power you want. The way that it controls
03:43:15 for that is it doesn't...
03:43:17 it's not focused on like what exactly
03:43:19 your powers are or what their themes are
03:43:21 or why you can do them. The only rules in the game
03:43:23 are about like the parameters
03:43:25 and they literally will have like a table
03:43:27 where like your power can...
03:43:29 you can have a power
03:43:31 that like... at like a level 5 power
03:43:33 can push
03:43:35 you know maybe a thousand
03:43:37 pounds but it can only push it...
03:43:39 but if it pushes that much
03:43:41 it's only at a certain speed
03:43:43 right? So it can only push...
03:43:45 if it's more it can push it slower
03:43:47 but if it's less it can push it faster
03:43:49 and then if you take a hit to the overall
03:43:51 power balance of those two things
03:43:53 you can also make it modular
03:43:55 whereby you can like do a sliding
03:43:57 scale where like okay well I want to push
03:43:59 more slower or less faster and I can control
03:44:01 for it. It's like...
03:44:03 it's granular like that. It's like
03:44:05 mathematically defined
03:44:07 in a way that allows...
03:44:09 that means that it can aesthetically be
03:44:11 sort of whatever you want it to be.
03:44:13 I used that system
03:44:15 to run... I tried to run a one piece
03:44:17 campaign and I thought that system
03:44:19 was good for like thinking up care
03:44:21 because one piece is so loosely defined
03:44:23 and like I don't know everybody just kind of
03:44:25 you know there's fruit powers
03:44:27 but none of them are consistent in how they work
03:44:29 and like other people are just basically
03:44:31 have superpowers just like for no reason
03:44:33 like Zoro...
03:44:35 can just cut steel... he's a hockey
03:44:37 I don't know whatever
03:44:39 some people are just hypnotists
03:44:41 and have mind powers just because
03:44:43 you know...
03:44:45 We made a friend we found a system
03:44:47 that meant for running JoJo RPGs
03:44:49 and a lot of the mechanics were
03:44:51 interesting. It's very funny.
03:44:53 It was funny because
03:44:55 essentially that the system was
03:44:57 it had momentum where you're kind of
03:44:59 standing and pacing a battle can change to try
03:45:01 and emulate the idea of when you have
03:45:03 all the leverage in a fight you can expend
03:45:05 it to do that one big move or whatever
03:45:07 and it was a cool idea
03:45:09 but it had the same thing of the powers are
03:45:11 very nebulous like it just says
03:45:13 write in your power and let
03:45:15 the GM determine what the point cost
03:45:17 of it should be
03:45:19 and then choose your deficiencies
03:45:21 and I think that was a cool idea but
03:45:23 me and a friend were like we started
03:45:25 co-engineering an idea where
03:45:27 I would run one heart I would run
03:45:29 one run campaign and they would run another
03:45:31 and
03:45:33 my campaign was
03:45:35 like JoJo part 4 it was very low stakes
03:45:37 the powers were kind of
03:45:39 lighthearted and silly and not too lethal
03:45:41 and
03:45:43 meanwhile so I made that campaign
03:45:45 while they made characters for it and then vice
03:45:47 versa and we were going to get more people in
03:45:49 and when we compared all of mine
03:45:51 was just like joke characters
03:45:53 they were like all the battles were weird
03:45:55 puzzles but you wouldn't really die
03:45:57 and it was a murder mystery investigation
03:45:59 hers was
03:46:01 everyone had like part
03:46:03 5 bullshit death powers
03:46:05 it would like could like
03:46:07 instant kill you
03:46:09 meanwhile all the characters I made to tackle it
03:46:11 were my brand of joke characters
03:46:13 and all the characters she made for my
03:46:15 campaign had absurd power levels
03:46:19 it was like shit we've got a bit of an imbalance
03:46:21 you could easily annihilate
03:46:23 there's a mismatch here
03:46:25 you could annihilate any of my people
03:46:27 while I would die
03:46:29 instantly in your universe unless
03:46:31 I was way cleverer than I actually
03:46:33 am
03:46:35 I think one of hers
03:46:37 one of hers
03:46:39 it's like
03:46:41 you're in a video game and you wandered into
03:46:43 the area that you're not leveled up enough
03:46:45 for yet it's like oops
03:46:47 fuck
03:46:49 my bloody villain
03:46:51 his stan
03:46:53 the only thing I'm proud of it was because I really liked
03:46:55 the stan name I picked for the main villain was
03:46:57 heaven helps the man and it was just
03:46:59 is that a song reference
03:47:01 it's gotta be
03:47:03 heaven helps the man
03:47:05 I'm not familiar
03:47:07 yeah it's a good song
03:47:09 and I'm why am I struggling
03:47:11 to tell you
03:47:13 Kenny Loggins
03:47:15 oh really
03:47:17 wait, okay
03:47:19 that's really funny actually
03:47:21 like
03:47:23 usually I would think of like a more
03:47:25 like heavy
03:47:27 or like a more like musicians
03:47:29 Kenny Loggins is like some fucking
03:47:31 80 soundtracks bullshit
03:47:33 it's really funny to have
03:47:35 a good stan named after a Kenny Loggins song
03:47:37 from Footloose
03:47:39 danger zone would be a good stan name if it isn't already
03:47:41 it would be
03:47:43 I prefer heaven helps the man it was also just
03:47:45 his aspect was like
03:47:47 gravity powered he had like a bunch of
03:47:49 his stan was actually just tattoos over his body
03:47:51 and he just basically exuded
03:47:53 push
03:47:55 and I had a very convoluted murder mystery
03:47:57 the players had to work out
03:47:59 around why this guy had stan powers and shit
03:48:01 meanwhile hers was there's a dying old
03:48:03 man who wants to learn the secrets
03:48:05 of immortality was like so he's got
03:48:07 intergalactic race through space
03:48:09 to find something
03:48:11 and there's going to be a bunch
03:48:13 of people murdering each other on the way
03:48:15 one stand was which was called snow
03:48:17 halation by the way had poisoned the whole
03:48:19 planet like it was just a planetary
03:48:21 scale you die here
03:48:23 it was yeah that was
03:48:25 her campaign that was her campaign
03:48:27 did the stories
03:48:29 regret that we never played it if only because I kind of wanted
03:48:31 to get the full
03:48:33 experience of it
03:48:35 I don't know
03:48:37 I have tainted this for jojo
03:48:39 but yeah I don't know anything about Kenny
03:48:41 logins other than that he's dangerous
03:48:43 what
03:48:45 I heard you mentioning his name and it just gave me
03:48:47 PTSD
03:48:49 I put it in general
03:48:51 let's have a gander
03:48:53 does he have a song called read minds
03:48:55 oh no this is
03:48:57 from like an obscure like blog from
03:48:59 like 2010
03:49:01 no I know what this blog is
03:49:03 wait what
03:49:05 Kenny logins ruined Christmas
03:49:07 I think
03:49:09 there was like a
03:49:11 I think there was a mad TV bit
03:49:13 with Kenny logins where he like constantly
03:49:15 pisses his pants
03:49:17 I have no idea why
03:49:19 but for some reason I can remember
03:49:21 that very vividly
03:49:23 yeah like okay
03:49:25 time there's a different time
03:49:27 I believe he's a fictional character
03:49:29 that was invented
03:49:31 yeah
03:49:33 but
03:49:35 maybe I should have given him
03:49:37 Sam Powers
03:49:41 what was that
03:49:43 I should have given him the power to read minds
03:49:45 if he was gonna
03:49:47 have a Kenny logins song
03:49:49 that would have been
03:49:51 it would have stopped
03:49:53 all the other players in their tracks like Ben
03:49:55 right now
03:49:57 I always wondered actually
03:49:59 how should it be to just like
03:50:01 say yeah
03:50:03 the enemy in this tabletop RPG has mind control
03:50:05 has like mind reading powers
03:50:07 so just tell us what your character is thinking
03:50:09 right now
03:50:11 even better oh my NPC has
03:50:13 mind control powers so actually your character
03:50:15 doesn't do that thing that would be
03:50:17 inconvenient for me if you did
03:50:19 actually he has this other thing
03:50:21 I had an evening
03:50:23 just binge reading
03:50:25 RPG horror stories
03:50:27 just like terrible GM
03:50:29 oh as in games like games gone wrong
03:50:31 yeah yeah
03:50:33 there is a subreddit for it called RPG
03:50:35 horror stories which is just
03:50:37 some of them are really painful
03:50:39 like there was
03:50:41 I haven't been able to find the story again
03:50:43 but there was one which just sent me a fucking
03:50:45 on edge which was
03:50:47 they found out that they had been playing online
03:50:49 they found out that for months one guy
03:50:51 had been without them knowing streaming
03:50:53 their game and had been getting an audience
03:50:59 so violated
03:51:01 the only reason
03:51:03 they were able to like start suspecting him
03:51:05 was they realized he started like getting
03:51:07 more and more like twitch
03:51:09 streamer-y and acting things up
03:51:11 and trying to take the lead in situations
03:51:13 he like
03:51:15 accidentally said to smash that like button
03:51:17 like in casual conversation
03:51:19 nothing
03:51:21 shit hooker thanks for the sub
03:51:23 anyway my character attached
03:51:25 hey he's been streaming us for months
03:51:27 it's like yeah
03:51:29 the advice in the friend was
03:51:31 you need to sue the shit out of this guy
03:51:33 he just
03:51:35 trueman showed all of you
03:51:37 it's like you show up to the game
03:51:39 and someone brought quiz nose
03:51:41 and he's handed them out
03:51:43 and when somebody else goes
03:51:45 hey thanks for the sub and the guy just starts sweating
03:51:47 he's like
03:51:51 that's why in this day and age
03:51:53 where you never know if you're being recorded
03:51:55 you just say that to everyone and just see
03:51:57 see if it picks them
03:51:59 a little bit
03:52:01 you never know if you're talking to a live streamer
03:52:05 I heard a um
03:52:07 I read a story or something
03:52:09 about like a kid
03:52:11 I think maybe this some kids
03:52:13 maybe it was just one kid I don't know but like
03:52:15 this kid watched youtube all the time
03:52:17 and he started saying like
03:52:19 like comment subscribe as like
03:52:21 he would say that like instead of goodbye
03:52:23 cause he like all the youtube channels he watched
03:52:25 would end their videos with like comment subscribe
03:52:27 so the kid started saying like comment subscribe
03:52:29 it was when his parents tucked him into bed
03:52:31 at night he would say that yeah
03:52:33 yeah he said like comment subscribe
03:52:35 that really makes you think about
03:52:37 anthropology
03:52:39 that's humanical right there
03:52:43 really makes you think about
03:52:45 I'm gonna have like comment subscribe
03:52:47 on my headstone
03:52:49 and my sub count
03:52:51 not even the day I lived and died
03:52:53 just the sub count
03:52:55 that's all that's gonna matter
03:52:57 in the future anyway
03:52:59 subscribe
03:53:01 I'll have a little uh
03:53:03 one of those um
03:53:05 those like code those bar code
03:53:07 that you can scan
03:53:09 that will give you a
03:53:11 yeah QR code
03:53:13 to scan if you want to send
03:53:15 bitcoin to my estate
03:53:17 in the future
03:53:19 please thank you
03:53:21 this is the worst thought I've had
03:53:23 but I had had it so let's throw it out there
03:53:25 there is on the youtube
03:53:27 the youtube wikia there is like
03:53:29 a page that is the list of deceased youtubers
03:53:31 and I swear
03:53:33 it's like right my sub counts
03:53:36 what the fuck
03:53:38 I gotta see if I'm right
03:53:40 let me double check myself
03:53:42 that's so cool
03:53:44 wait wait what
03:53:45 how many did you achieve
03:53:47 while you were still alive what was your high score
03:53:49 I mean that's okay
03:53:51 it's literally ranked
03:53:53 that was my fault I've linked
03:53:55 that was like my that was my fault
03:53:57 it is ranked it is ranked
03:53:59 okay well this is
03:54:01 this is wikitubio
03:54:03 actually wikipedia
03:54:05 the fact is someone
03:54:07 went this right
03:54:09 and I have a question
03:54:11 and this is a ghoulish question
03:54:13 should the count stop
03:54:15 once you're dead
03:54:17 is that you
03:54:19 that's the cut off that's like
03:54:21 it's your high score
03:54:23 I think it should because
03:54:25 if you're gone
03:54:27 then you can't make anymore videos
03:54:29 you're not on the grind anymore
03:54:31 yeah you're not on the grind anymore
03:54:33 so the project as ray william johnson
03:54:35 once said this project
03:54:37 this project has discontinued
03:54:39 so it should stay at the sub count
03:54:41 when they died
03:54:43 okay I disagree I think
03:54:45 they should just track both because
03:54:47 I think it would be interesting
03:54:49 if people's channels like got a big influx
03:54:51 of subs after they died
03:54:53 and I think that probably in some cases
03:54:55 would happen and I think it's worth
03:54:57 having both numbers
03:54:59 I think that count should be segregated
03:55:01 so that's your post def momentum
03:55:05 the word suicide appears
03:55:07 on this page 107 times
03:55:09 if someone
03:55:11 died
03:55:13 if someone died with like a million subs
03:55:15 and then after they died
03:55:17 their work was discovered
03:55:19 they get 50 million people
03:55:21 sub and like
03:55:23 I guess
03:55:25 no but why would you sub
03:55:27 there won't be any more updates
03:55:29 I mean you're looking at
03:55:31 in purely rational terms
03:55:33 rather than like emotional ones
03:55:35 or someone not knowing
03:55:37 oh yeah
03:55:39 I know it's a bit of a weird gesture
03:55:41 but you know
03:55:47 I mean including the sub count
03:55:49 is pretty gauche either way
03:55:51 yeah no
03:55:53 that was when I read this
03:55:55 it was really fucked up
03:55:57 and then a part of my brain did go
03:55:59 they really all stop counting once they're dead right
03:56:03 the duality
03:56:05 they should publish
03:56:07 obituaries in the newspaper
03:56:09 and say like how many people showed up
03:56:11 to your funeral and like rank them
03:56:13 that week
03:56:15 who was the highest scoring death this week
03:56:17 okay I'm scrolling through this
03:56:19 I'm just looking through them I'm seeing like
03:56:21 Total Biscuit, Christina Grimmie
03:56:23 was on Steph and Carl okay
03:56:25 David Bowie is not a YouTuber
03:56:27 I don't care if he has a YouTube channel
03:56:29 you don't get the put them on this list
03:56:31 oh that
03:56:33 he doesn't deserve the cloud
03:56:35 he didn't even break a million subs
03:56:37 no free cloud David
03:56:39 yeah come on David
03:56:43 social climbers man
03:56:45 member of the prodigy you can't
03:56:47 like guys
03:56:49 Prince Philip
03:56:51 wait
03:56:53 is that what killed him
03:56:55 is that his reason for death
03:56:57 yeah not released to the public
03:56:59 this is so stupid
03:57:01 this list is really funny
03:57:03 it includes people with like
03:57:05 700 subs in the bottom
03:57:07 smaller than I expected
03:57:09 that even put on here
03:57:11 I know who hardly any of these people are
03:57:13 Joe Strummer
03:57:15 wait yeah there's people
03:57:17 Joe Strummer died before YouTube came out
03:57:19 what is this
03:57:21 there's people on this list with 500 subs
03:57:23 like these aren't YouTubers
03:57:25 they're just people who had one channel
03:57:27 I don't know
03:57:29 they make me wonder how they found those
03:57:31 random people who had an account with no
03:57:33 with like barely any followers but like
03:57:35 ugh
03:57:37 that's like what is the point of this list
03:57:39 that's like kind of worse because they're definitely not public figures
03:57:41 and they don't
03:57:43 you don't need that shit
03:57:45 and they are ranked below a bunch of people
03:57:47 I don't like this
03:57:49 what the
03:57:51 God we really could have ended this episode
03:57:53 on a high note with that Nate joke
03:57:55 but instead we sent down this rabbit hole
03:57:57 and now we're here
03:57:59 I am so proud I remembered this
03:58:01 and I can just drag us down
03:58:03 into the depths
03:58:05 no wasted content Tom
03:58:07 you know that's fair
03:58:09 I just you know I shouldn't have brought it back
03:58:11 I shouldn't have brought this up I could have saved this if I ever came back
03:58:13 it could have been a topic of discussion
03:58:15 but I guess it is now
03:58:17 you can click
03:58:19 you can click on
03:58:21 oh my god I can go
03:58:23 I can go to bad wolf gaming's
03:58:25 youtube channel with his
03:58:27 4.92k subs
03:58:29 and I can just watch his videos
03:58:31 they're just there
03:58:33 6 years ago
03:58:35 no do you know what's fucked up about this list actually
03:58:37 oh my god
03:58:39 what's really fucked up is
03:58:41 this list has gotten so much
03:58:43 more than the last time
03:58:45 can control f for prank
03:58:47 one of these people did die in a
03:58:49 ghost prank they dressed up as a ghost
03:58:51 and got shot fuck off
03:58:53 you're lying
03:58:55 they became the prank
03:58:57 you can do it
03:58:59 control f prank you'll find it
03:59:01 oh no his last
03:59:03 oh my god
03:59:05 guys bad wolf gaming's last
03:59:07 video he looks visibly
03:59:09 emaciated his last video
03:59:11 it's called I've got some bad news
03:59:13 and he's saying like they found
03:59:15 like a tumor in his abdomen
03:59:17 and it's like
03:59:19 he's literally saying he's sick and might die
03:59:21 and that's his last video and it happened
03:59:23 oh my god
03:59:25 this is macabre but just
03:59:27 the way it's worded is fucking
03:59:29 you know
03:59:31 you know what
03:59:33 you know what though I would describe
03:59:35 I would describe this list
03:59:37 of deceased youtubers ranked
03:59:39 according to sub count as rather
03:59:41 lynchian I really would
03:59:43 I would say
03:59:45 that this juxtaposes
03:59:47 I would say that this juxtaposes
03:59:49 the mundane with the macabre in a way
03:59:51 that calls the attention to the
03:59:53 containment of one inside of the other
03:59:55 I really would
03:59:57 where's the electricity
03:59:59 oh no
04:00:01 wow you did it
04:00:03 you made it so cool
04:00:05 it's like the fourth circle
04:00:07 oh I'm noticing at the top
04:00:09 that there is some standards
04:00:11 please note channels need to have at least
04:00:13 500 subscribers to be added
04:00:15 what
04:00:17 alright pro tip to anyone

04:00:35 on this
04:00:37 yeah lung cancer the lung cancer was
04:00:39 caused by his excessive indulgence

04:00:47 I imagine by
04:00:49 okay this one this one is the one I
04:00:51 always remember Asia McGowan

04:00:55 indignity in this
