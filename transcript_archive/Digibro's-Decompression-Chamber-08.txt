00:00:00 So, when we left off on the last decompression chamber, I was, uh,
00:00:26 having this grand realization that I can get so far ahead of myself on work, that now I get to experiment and do other, other fun things, explore other avenues of art.
00:00:42 Um, not so much exploring other talents I might have, but trying to develop new talents that I don't have, such as being able to draw and create music.
00:00:55 And, um, do other stuff like that.
00:01:00 I had forgotten to list on the last part that learning Japanese should be something I do at some point in the near future, you know, with all this extra allotted time.
00:01:10 You hear that loud ass fucking car?
00:01:17 See, decompression chambers often record it during the day, unlike most of my stuff.
00:01:22 And I always forget that a part of why I don't record during the day is that, um, I live on a fucking major road, so there's constantly loud cars and shit.
00:01:32 So yeah, I was talking about developing all these other talents, and so that's what I've been working on mostly for the last week.
00:01:39 Um, it's really interesting, because it feels like I'm putting a lot more effort into other things, not related to my main content that you guys have been seeing.
00:01:49 And yet it seems impossible to slow down my main content.
00:01:53 Not that I'm trying to or anything, but it's amazing how I can do other things, and the other stuff will just naturally come, you know?
00:02:03 I mean, there's been a DigiBros video every day, um, there will be all month.
00:02:08 Um, I'll talk more about that in a little bit.
00:02:12 But, like, for up until the previous podcast, it was like this long period where I had at least two videos out every day, you know, like one DigiBros and one normal video.
00:02:23 And I thought that maybe that would slow down if I started working on these other projects. It hasn't slowed down at all.
00:02:28 Um, in part because there's just so much stuff that I get attached to, you know?
00:02:33 The WaveMotionCannon podcast finally fucking came out, the first half of it anyways.
00:02:37 I don't know why the second half is not coming out until next year, apparently, or why it takes them so long to edit them, considering he didn't really cut anything.
00:02:46 So, um, I have no idea why that is, but it's finally out in some capacity, you know?
00:02:52 Um, main channel video came out, a bunch of after dark stuff came out, and it's like, it just kind of happens.
00:03:00 Because, I mean, with the vlogs, it could just, you know, sometimes I just turn on a camera and rant for 20 minutes, and that's such a miniscule part of my day to do that.
00:03:09 You know, that it's like, oh, a 20 minute video came out, you know, without me even having to think about it, just because it came to mind, you know?
00:03:18 There's other stuff I've just been doing on the side, I can't even really remember what a lot of what I put out this past week was, because I've been so focused on this other stuff.
00:03:28 I've been practicing drawing, been drawing at least one picture a day for the last few days, just bought a tablet, so an expensive one with a screen on it, so hopefully that'll be cool.
00:03:42 And I learned how to fucking use Fruity Loops, the music production program that Shade uses to produce all his beats, and it's very common, it's used by a lot of people.
00:03:53 And it's funny, because it has a totally alien interface, so whenever I watched him working on it, I was like, I don't understand any of this, and maybe I never will.
00:04:01 But of course, once I installed it, you know, it took me like five hours, and I learned basically everything, so it wasn't that hard to use.
00:04:10 And it's interesting, because I feel like I have a head start in a lot of these categories, because of the fact not only that I analyze them professionally, so I kind of know what is supposed to happen for it to be good,
00:04:28 but I also have a lot of history in adjacent things.
00:04:31 You know, I may not have been using FL Studio or using any like professional materials, but I have been making beats for like five years now, you know, like mostly acapella or weird shit that I make in Audacity.
00:04:43 And it's kind of interesting how FL Studio, you know, just gives me the tools to do the same shit I've been doing much easier and with better sounds, you know, so it's not hard.
00:04:54 And I understand, you know, I may not know music theory, I don't know how to make a chord, for instance, or a chord progression, but there's a lot of stuff I can do with sampling and simple beat making that just comes totally natural to me.
00:05:07 I just get it, you know, it's not, it's, I keep thinking like, wow, this is easy, but then I think, well, maybe for a lot of people it wouldn't be who don't have any musical experience, it probably would be a lot more difficult to know what sounds right,
00:05:20 or, you know, something like that, but for me it feels very natural to make music, so that is really cool, and it's been fun, and I've made a bunch of songs.
00:05:31 Drawing, on the other hand, does not come naturally at all, but again, I do have some basic understanding. It helps, I took a lot of art classes, you know, I,
00:05:39 aside from just basic art in high school, I also took, like, design classes, both for traditional and digital media in college, so, you know, I understand the basics.
00:05:54 I know what I'm doing wrong is what I'm saying, like, you know, I can draw a shitty picture and be like, okay, well, you know, the proportions are off here and here, and I got the, you know, this isn't quite sized right, and I know what's wrong with it,
00:06:08 which is more than I think, it's true for a lot of people who are shitty artists, you know, it's not, I think the most important thing to getting better in any medium is understanding what your faults are,
00:06:19 like, that's the easiest way to help you improve is if you know what you've done wrong, and it's amazing how many people don't, how many people try to do something and then they completely don't realize what the problems are, you know,
00:06:33 and that makes it really hard, it's really hard to get better that way, you know, and it's why when people come to me for advice on things like writing, I've always had a really difficult time with it, I'm not good, I mean, I am good at giving advice,
00:06:51 I'm not good at wanting to give advice, because, you know, I'm sure you realize that I have fans constantly asking me like, you know, to check, like, check out their thing, tell them what's wrong with it or something like that,
00:07:03 and too often, the answer is like, some kind of fundamental misunderstanding, or just needing to change the way you think about your writing, like, there's a lot that you only pick up on with lots of experience and studying how other people write,
00:07:19 don't just like, listen to other people who write, but study how they write, study like, read your thing and then read their thing and then like, if you don't think yours is as good, figure out why it's not as good,
00:07:29 because so many people will send me something and like, what they're expecting to be wrong with it is something simple, but what's actually wrong with it is something fundamental, you know, and that is very difficult to break that news to someone,
00:07:46 that's why I don't like giving criticism, because no one realizes how harsh the criticism is going to be, no one realizes like, the depth on which I'm going to have to break down their stuff, where, I mean, for some people it's just not having good ideas,
00:08:02 for some people it's like, you know, just fundamentally not understanding how to be interesting, for some people it's not understanding just how to grammar or syntax well, or to sentence a structure in an interesting way, or to be thought provoking,
00:08:18 or to like, structural problems are everywhere, I mean, the biggest thing is just simplifying all the bullshit out, newbie writers put so much stuff that's completely unnecessary into their scripts, and I've talked about that in the Tips to Write Gooder video, that just like, the biggest things that bother me are erroneous details that are completely unnecessary,
00:08:41 but nonetheless, I think I am pretty good at recognizing my own problems, and I'll tell you about this incredibly sad story that me and Ben Saint encountered recently, and I don't want to like, slag on this person, but I just think it's a really fascinating example of what I'm talking about,
00:09:02 we were on Topastic, which is this comics uploading website, it's like a place for webcomics to find an audience essentially, and Ben has his comics on there, he doesn't take it very seriously because it really hasn't helped his like, a Patreon growth that much to have his stuff up there,
00:09:22 but one of his comics recently became like, on the hot page kind of thing of Topastic, his comic The Champion, and we were looking at other stuff on the website, and just kind of like, you know, trolling through and looking at what's what, and we stumble upon this webcomic called like, diaries of an Aspie girl or something like that,
00:09:45 and it's a fairly long running comic with just absolutely abysmal artwork, like the worst possible artwork that it could possibly have, it looked garish, and I mean the writing is not spectacular, it's just kind of a self, an autobiographical except not,
00:10:09 like you know, it's like a story about a character who was obviously the writer, like based around the writer and how she perceives herself, but we were looking at the forums, we came upon it, I don't remember if we came upon it from the comic itself or from the forums,
00:10:24 but she had a forum post that was like, why is my comic not more popular, and she writes like a few paragraphs about it, and her idea of why the comic's not popular is because she's not marketing it well, she was like, I know marketing's important, but you know, it seems to me like there's people who put a lot,
00:10:43 like you know, I'm putting so much effort into this, why is nobody reading it, it seems like there's people who are putting so much effort into, or so much less effort into their work, who are just getting really big, really fast, and then we looked through the responses, and it took a long time before we got to someone who had the balls to just say the artwork is not very good, no one was saying it,
00:11:07 all of them were hitting it with shallow platitudes about how like, oh well, you know, if you try to, you know, maybe strategize, people tend to like stuff that fits into what they already kind of like, you know, so maybe you have to chase what people are really, no, the artwork is unbelievably bad, that's the problem, you know, and it took a long time before somebody even suggested that,
00:11:32 and that's the most harmful thing that could happen to an artist is both not understanding what their problem is, and then also no one being willing to tell them what their problem is, you know, but it's rough, because I bet that she'd be resistant to it, you know, most of the time when people come to me looking for advice and I give them advice,
00:11:54 a lot of them are resistant, or a lot of them just kind of give up, you know, once they realize, like, that the issue is they haven't been writing for long enough, then it's like, oh well, I can't change that, you know, I can't just edit that in my script immediately, it's like, your problem is that you're young and you just started, and therefore everything you write is going to be terrible for the next five years, you know, like, that's the real issue here,
00:12:19 revisit this idea further down the road when you've matured as a writer, like, not easy advice to give anybody, but pretty much exactly the case, nobody's that great when they first start, and if they are, they can probably recognize their own problems and improve them more quickly, you know, or they just need one or two little hints, and then they'll be on their way, you know,
00:12:41 Now, my problem as an artist is that I've been doing it for five days, I'm, you know, only using other people's art as base for mine, like, I'm just copying, you know, poses and stuff, and it's going to take a long time before I'm good enough for my work to be presentable,
00:13:00 You'll notice that I haven't been posting any of these artworks anywhere, because they're not good, they're not presentable, they are at best charming, you know, like, and I'm drawing this character, who's part of a story that I'm working on, this fiction story, I kind of hinted that I was going to go down that road in the last podcast, and I've been trying to like nail down what this character looks like and feels like, so I've just been drawing,
00:13:30 the character over and over again, and will continue to do so, probably for months, you know, I will probably draw this character at least once a day, hopefully more than once a day, for like three or four months before, you know, the artwork will be of a quality that is even presentable, you know, and when this thing comes out,
00:13:51 because art will be important to it, I need to be able to draw for this piece of work, even when it comes out the artwork is not going to be great, the artwork is going to be mediocre, you know, it is going to be a project released with mediocre artwork of a newbie artist,
00:14:08 and if I continue drawing, then eventually I might release something with good artwork, but this will not be that, I understand all that, I'm not out to make something good here, you know, like conventionally, I'm not out to make something that's perfect, especially not in terms of the art, the art will probably be the least important aspect of it, or at least the least quality aspect of it, you know, it's going to have music that's okay, it's going to have music that uses all the experience I've built up as a musician,
00:14:36 but that's not a lot, you know, you're not going to hear super memorable chords and melodies that I invented by myself, that won't be a thing in it,
00:14:47 so yeah, it's not, it's not going to be amazing, and I understand that, and I wish more people had that level of self criticism to, you know, instead of asking me what's wrong with their work, just accept that they're not going to make anything good for a while, and they should not even, don't even bother asking me, you know, come to me when you've been working for five years,
00:15:14 and you feel like you're about to have a breakthrough, or you're on the cusp of a breakthrough, but there's just one or two things you think you need to tweak, you know, and maybe that's the kind of thing I could help a lot more with,
00:15:27 you know, fellow PCP member Tommy Oliver is writing a book right now, you know, he sent me a chapter of it, he's someone I could work with, because he's already got a basis of like he's pretty good, you know, he's a pretty good writer, fiction writer,
00:15:42 more so than being good at writing fiction, I'm much better at editing it, I'm much better at like helping people revise something that's already there, because, again, I analyze this stuff for a living, you know, like, I am good at that aspect, I could totally edit your novel, it just has to be on a certain level of like,
00:16:02 like, it has to be something that is basically good, it just needs to be fixed in some ways, you know, someone like Tom, I could tell him like, hey, maybe think about changing the word choice in this sentence, it actually is like that, you know, which is what I think people imagine it's going to be when they show me stuff, and it's usually not like that,
00:16:22 you know, really, you should be sending stuff that, well, I mean, don't send me anything, because I'm not going to look at it, but, so yeah, forget that whole line of thought, because like, this is stuff, when people ask me to look at stuff,
00:16:40 um, what they don't seem to understand is that editors, that's a job, that's a job that people get paid to do, that's a skill set, you know, being able to edit someone's work and look at it and understand what's wrong with it and help them to fix it, is something that most people would pay for, you know, if you're working professionally,
00:17:01 and aside from the fact that I'm not a professional editor and I don't have time, if I was, I would expect to get paid, you know, because I do think I could do that, I think I could be an editor, it's a career choice I've considered, if whatever I'm doing doesn't work out, the biggest problem with being an editor is that the writers hate you,
00:17:18 you know, like, unless they're someone who really prizes the idea of an editor, they're going to hate you, and also, I always want everything to be to my taste, you know, I'm not good at editing for what I think the audience will want most, I mean, I guess I could, I could probably do that, but like, I really like to push my own agenda when it comes to seeing other people's work, you know, that's why I don't do it that much, even for my friends.
00:17:48 But um, God, I don't know how I got into that tangent about editing.
00:17:57 Right, I was talking about this art and music I've been making, really surreal experience though, making things that nobody gets to see again, like, this is something I've, you know, I've experienced that in the past back when I wanted to be a fiction writer, I have all these stories that have never seen the light of day,
00:18:14 that you know I mean that fucking novel I wrote back in 2010 nobody had ever read
00:18:19 it until you know now now that people are listening to it and offering comments
00:18:24 on the subreddit which has been great it's been really fulfilling to finally
00:18:28 get people talking about that story and I might talk about a couple more
00:18:34 eventually though none of them are nearly as written as that one was God I've
00:18:42 considered even doing an audio version of Cyrano and purple Steve which is
00:18:46 highly incomplete but I really like what there is of it if you don't know what
00:18:51 that is you'll maybe learn eventually but yeah yeah what the fuck am I talking
00:18:58 about holy shit I've completely lost track of where I was going with that oh
00:19:03 yeah yeah yeah yeah making stuff that nobody gets to see I'm sure most people
00:19:07 experience this all the time like if you work on bigger projects or something
00:19:12 or if you're someone who you know gets an idea in your head and it doesn't get
00:19:15 fully realized until later then like I guess it's pretty common to to have these
00:19:20 things that they don't get to see be seen by anybody but I've gotten used to
00:19:24 this fast-paced I make something immediately release it to my audience
00:19:27 immediately get feedback and it's done and now I'm like I've made a bunch of
00:19:32 songs that are on the internet I've posted them on the internet they're
00:19:37 online they're just not under my name and there's a good reason for it because
00:19:46 they're all tied into this story I'm working on and I don't want to release
00:19:51 them publicly until there's more context for why they're there because if you were
00:19:57 to just go and listen to these right now you'd be like why you know why why this
00:20:03 song but if you understand the context of the story and how they're going to be
00:20:08 used in the story then it'll make a lot more sense so yeah those won't come out
00:20:16 to later but they're they're decent they're decent little songs I've
00:20:19 listened to them you know a number of times not just because I made them but
00:20:22 I think they're they're kind of neat very simple but um yeah like it's
00:20:29 interesting to have released content online that nobody's looking at and I
00:20:33 kind of would love for those songs and the account they're associated with to
00:20:40 like gain some some fandom by themselves without me even doing anything
00:20:45 it's impossible though but there's no way to grow a channel without any word of
00:20:50 mouth without showing it to anybody you know so yeah I have no idea if that'll
00:20:56 even be possible most likely nobody's gonna see these songs until the work is
00:21:01 complete along with anything else I do for it until then or these drawings or
00:21:06 anything else I'm doing so yeah it's a weird experience and and it doesn't
00:21:12 really show because again it hasn't taken away from anything like main
00:21:17 channel videos aside you know I used to be worried that like vlogs were gonna
00:21:21 take away from the main channel and that didn't I mean I guess that happened a
00:21:26 little bit back in like August when I barely made any videos just because I
00:21:30 wasn't up for it I was like way more into the idea of vlogging I was getting
00:21:34 ready for rad con I was excited about people moving in and then like that what
00:21:40 I what I was gonna do with vlogging I kind of lost interest in once everything
00:21:45 had kind of transpired but the the vlogs did not interrupt the main videos
00:21:53 once I got back to work on them you know they they've been coming out
00:21:56 consistently and then I was worried that the the art and the other stuff would
00:22:01 get in the way of the vlogs but that also hasn't happened because it turns
00:22:05 out that vlogging and getting out podcasts is something that I do so second
00:22:10 nature like it doesn't even occur to me that I'm doing it there's no like
00:22:13 preparation for any of the videos I do like I feel like other people have to
00:22:18 psych themselves up and get ready you know they have to like think about what
00:22:23 it's gonna be and prepare I barely do that like when it comes to a vlog I get
00:22:28 an idea I turn on a camera I rant there's there's very little like like
00:22:33 fully thinking out the point sometimes that could be to the detriment of the
00:22:36 video some of my vlogs are a little too rambly they kind of don't really make
00:22:40 the point as solidly as I would like but I've gotten better and better at it and
00:22:46 even stuff like the edited ones like the mindless self-indulgence one like you
00:22:51 know I I knew I knew all that stuff so I could go through it but I did not like
00:22:54 pre-plan everything I was gonna say I just kind of sat down turn the camera
00:22:57 and went and it came out really great and something like handfuls of Zen has
00:23:02 like some notes taken and I had to play through the whole game but aside from
00:23:05 that you know didn't take that much thought because I'm I'm already again
00:23:13 it's like automatic so these things just come out as they are and they have
00:23:16 they're not affected by this other artwork I'm doing which is really good
00:23:20 that's exactly what I wanted and it's been great I don't know exactly what I'm
00:23:26 doing for the next week DeVue just I guess I got it guess it's already been
00:23:32 two days DeVue went home to to see his parents for the holidays he's not gonna
00:23:38 be gone that long though he he like talked them out of making him stay too
00:23:42 long but I gotta have another video written for him probably by the time
00:23:46 he gets back and then start working on possibly building another backlog like I
00:23:52 did with November and just giving myself the agency to do all this stuff
00:23:56 because the the the story that I'm working on that I'm doing all these
00:24:00 drawings and music for is the story itself is very small but the project is
00:24:09 big if that makes sense like you know one of the fascinating things about art
00:24:16 is that the sort of sort of the quality of it or the like the amount of it is
00:24:22 not really proportional to how much effort it takes like you can make an
00:24:27 analysis video that's like the coolest video that you'll see all year and that
00:24:34 analysis video might only take like two days to make whereas a chapter of a
00:24:40 comic that's like the coolest chapter of a comic you saw all year probably took
00:24:45 at minimum a month you know probably more than a month but at minimum a month
00:24:50 to make so it's interesting that like the audience reaction to each of those
00:24:56 could be about the same takes about 15 minutes to watch the video takes about
00:24:59 15 minutes to read the comic chapter you know both of them have a certain level
00:25:03 of impact but one just by necessity of what it is took way more effort and
00:25:08 time and I think that's one of the most difficult things for a lot of artists
00:25:13 to reconcile with it it causes a lot of elitism because you know in the minds of
00:25:19 a lot of artists they're like I worked so much harder I deserve you know more
00:25:24 reward but really the quality of the final product is not all that affected
00:25:30 by how much work went into it you know I mean it can be sometimes what makes it
00:25:34 great is how much work went into it but it's not the only way to make something
00:25:38 good you can make something good in a million different ways you can make
00:25:40 something great that's spontaneous you know a lot of great music is all about
00:25:44 improvisation and just having a general understanding of how to perform and you
00:25:51 know spontaneity can be amazing for art but some of it has to take a long time
00:25:56 and it really just comes down to what you like doing do you like making short
00:26:02 form art or long form art if you like making long form art I'm sorry you know
00:26:06 I'm sorry for you you've trapped yourself in a hell but you know I mostly make
00:26:12 short form art but this one that I'm working on the nature of the project
00:26:16 will make it a much larger project than normal you know longer it'll take
00:26:21 longer to make than it would take me to make any analysis video because of the
00:26:27 nature of the project even though the story itself will be this really small
00:26:31 self-contained story that will probably be consumed consumable in like two to
00:26:36 four hours it will not be long but like just the number of skills that I have
00:26:43 to develop to even make it possible is a huge element of it so yeah
00:26:52 that's a fun fun paradigm to explore and it's not something I would have been
00:26:57 willing to do for any of the last three years you know or more because I would
00:27:05 have been scared that it would get in the way but now that it doesn't look like
00:27:09 it will I can just take my time with it I'm not I'm not in a huge rush to
00:27:13 develop these skills but I'd like this project to be done within the next like
00:27:16 six months so I'm gonna at least try to work fast and hard enough to get it done
00:27:22 within six months but besides that um yeah it can take its time and feels good
00:27:30 man alright I'm kind of just repeating what I said on the last podcast at this
00:27:34 point but we'll I'll cut the clip here and I'll only record if I find something
00:27:38 totally new and interesting to talk about between now and whenever this comes
00:27:42 out probably late I apologize if this podcast can get a bit repetitive at times
00:27:51 I mean when it's just me talking about my life and my life is kind of the same
00:27:56 weekend and week out a lot of the information is gonna be kind of
00:27:59 repetitive but I mean in a way what is storytelling if not just you know
00:28:05 constantly recontextualizing the same sort of basic human ideas in different
00:28:13 ways to unpack different nuances from them you know it's hardly surprising
00:28:17 that one storyteller will have a lot of commonality among their stories
00:28:20 especially if they put one out every fucking week it's funny because in some
00:28:25 ways this is my favorite show to do because it's the closest to just what's
00:28:29 on my mind at any given time this podcast is just like just raw digi bro
00:28:37 Ben said recently I came I don't remember if I told the story on here I
00:28:42 came downstairs and said like it was telling Ben something and then I was
00:28:47 like yeah I just explained it on the decompression chamber and he was like you
00:28:50 know listening to the decompression chamber and talking to you in person
00:28:53 it's like it's essentially the same experience you get a lot of like repeated
00:28:58 information between the two and I'm like yeah it's basically exactly the
00:29:02 stuff I talked to my friends about and the stuff I talk about in general which
00:29:06 in some ways is a sign that the decompression chamber is kind of waning
00:29:13 in its importance when I first started it it was around the time that Ben and
00:29:19 DeVue had been here for like a month because I think no I started this in late
00:29:24 October so around two months but I still wasn't quite I don't know I wasn't
00:29:29 completely you know comfortable talking to them about everything at that point
00:29:34 yet I wasn't like constantly sharing what was going on with me and stuff like
00:29:38 that Victor wasn't around for a while so you know he's the one I'd usually talk
00:29:43 to a lot of talk to about a lot of this stuff and what's great about the
00:29:47 decompression chamber is that as I explained in a previous episode it
00:29:51 really gives me the chance to be like unfiltered and talk in a way that is not
00:29:55 the same as how I talk to other people necessarily I mean there's a lot of
00:29:59 overlap like I just said Ben has you know said that talking to me is practically
00:30:04 the same thing but it's it's not me trying to put on a show and like be about
00:30:10 a topic that the other person can relate to let's put it that way like when we do
00:30:14 Digi Bros I usually try to involve Victor on some level but on this podcast it's
00:30:20 just me talking about my life so this is by far the closest you're getting to
00:30:26 what it's like the exact experience of talking to me in person especially the
00:30:32 lack of response from the other side need the one-sided nature of the
00:30:36 conversation is also is also true to life but nonetheless it is fun to do and
00:30:48 then that's kind of what what's keeping it going like I don't know that it's a
00:30:52 great show or that it has a lot of unique ideas it's just kind of fun to do
00:30:57 but I can't see it living too long I don't think this show is gonna be around
00:31:02 well into 2017 or anything I also think that probably Digi Bros is just gonna
00:31:09 get shut down I mean it's it seemed it seemed like an inevitability at one point
00:31:15 when we thought Victor was gonna move away and and like we were saying you
00:31:20 know Digi Bros is gonna end cuz he's gonna leave to go to college or to go
00:31:24 to grad school rather and that didn't end up happening so Digi Bros got to live
00:31:29 a little longer but then we ended up putting it on hold for like two months
00:31:32 because we were just busy and then we finally got back to it it doesn't really
00:31:38 seem like anybody cares anymore like this bomber man let's play we've been
00:31:42 doing the view counts are at like an all-time low comments are at an all-time
00:31:48 low we barely get any comments and I mean reading comments I'm sure I've said
00:31:52 this about all the work I do but like comments are really what let me know
00:31:56 that people are engaging with it you know if I don't get any comments I don't
00:31:59 feel like anybody really cares that much like people are just kind of throwing it
00:32:03 on and you know passively listening to it because it just means we weren't
00:32:09 necessarily engaging enough to like provoke a discussion I don't know maybe
00:32:13 that's just not the way people you know interact with Digi Bros but we used to
00:32:16 get more comments than we get now and you know I'm not watching them back I
00:32:20 don't think Victor's watching them either it used to be that we we both
00:32:25 watch a lot of them or our friends would watch them nobody I know is watching
00:32:30 them you know I think hippo might be but even he he's been saying that he has to
00:32:36 cut back on his Digi Bro content because they're so fucking much of it so yeah I
00:32:41 don't see Digi Bros surviving because there's not much incentive to do it and
00:32:44 most of the stuff like I don't I don't think our discussions have been that
00:32:47 great in the VAR man playthrough because at this point I run so many shows where
00:32:51 I get out like all the really salient things I want to talk about like when
00:32:56 when Digi Bros started I didn't have vlogs coming out all the time I didn't
00:33:01 have you know three fucking podcasts that I that I'm on and so it made sense
00:33:07 like I had all these backed up topics that I just bust out on the show and
00:33:11 now most of those are things I would make vlogs about because I do want those
00:33:15 those things to be out there and a vlog is just gonna perform way better like you
00:33:20 know on some level it's like I feel bad like you know Victor said the reason you
00:33:25 know the reason we have nothing to talk about is because you constantly make
00:33:28 podcasts and vlogs and I'm like yeah those podcast and vlogs get the way the
00:33:31 fuck more views you know so it's like the stuff was kind of just just exit
00:33:37 like we were doing what for my money is one of the best let's play shows on
00:33:42 YouTube like I really think Digi Bros was one of the strongest let's play
00:33:46 shows that's ever been it was basically just a podcast but a really fun podcast
00:33:52 with two brothers who you know had tons of running gags and fun things to talk
00:33:56 about and but it never got any attention it never grew it stayed at like this
00:34:01 really steady viewer base the whole way through never grew any bigger you know
00:34:07 when it goes away people people aren't that excited when it comes back you know
00:34:12 when it was gone people kept asking me about if it was gonna come back but then
00:34:15 it came back and no one was like oh Digi Bros finally you know it was just kind
00:34:20 of like oh yeah you guys are playing Bomberman that's cool you know and I'm
00:34:25 sure if we'd come back with like the Dark Souls 3 DLC people will be more
00:34:28 excited and I keep getting asked like why don't you guys why don't you guys do
00:34:30 in the Dark Souls 3 DLC we didn't want to do it like Victor thought it was too
00:34:36 hard and it's only one level and he was like let's just wait for all three of
00:34:39 them to come out and then we could do all three because they're gonna make three
00:34:41 DLCs for the game but it's like if you guys are if people only care about the
00:34:47 game and not actually about the show because the game is fucking completely
00:34:50 inconsequential on Digi Bros it's just a podcast show you know and it used to
00:34:56 have all these really interesting topics that to me were like these should be on
00:35:00 a bigger stage like this is such a good podcast show and that's why we did like
00:35:05 the Digi Bros Discuss Berserk video which got huge the video really took off
00:35:10 and that was a discussion that would have happened on Digi Bros like we were
00:35:13 going to talk about that and then I said why don't we just make this its own
00:35:17 video and people probably love it and they did you know we did the same thing
00:35:21 with the Ghostbusters podcast which you know was somewhat successful it was not
00:35:27 that great because I was a total asshole and played devil's advocate the whole
00:35:31 time but you know those are shows that I knew had potential to to be to to gain
00:35:38 some kind of you know attraction where Digi Bros was not gaining any and at
00:35:44 this point it's like now that I'm taking all the best stuff that like the
00:35:47 stuff that made Digi Bro great now that I'm taking those discussions out of
00:35:51 Digi Bros and putting them in other places you know Digi Bros itself is not
00:35:57 only worse but even less popular so there's doesn't seem like there's much
00:36:01 reason to keep it going I mean me and Victor the story is always the same when
00:36:04 it comes to just our personal lives you know I'm always making videos and he's
00:36:09 always struggling to find work it's always what it's going to be so at this
00:36:15 point it seems like there's no real reason to keep it running and there is
00:36:18 the Digi Bro and others show with DeVoo which DeVoo is way into the idea of
00:36:23 doing more Let's Plays and I think we might continue doing it if he's willing
00:36:29 to like edit them and stuff because for me it's just a matter of like you know
00:36:34 we're gonna sit down and play a game and talk for three hours and that's already
00:36:39 in itself like a huge time investment of time that I could be spending working
00:36:43 on other videos that will be relevant that will get attention that will explore
00:36:48 the ideas I want to explore you know and then after those three hours I have to
00:36:51 edit all that and break it up into chunks and post it online you know and
00:36:56 part of the appeal of Digi Bros was just that it was a way for me and Victor to
00:36:59 hang out me and DeVoo can hang out anytime we can have these discussions
00:37:03 anytime we want you know with him it's just a show we're doing so there's
00:37:08 there's even less incentive for me to keep it going but if DeVoo wants to
00:37:13 keep doing it I mean I can show up and play a game and talk you know that's a
00:37:16 huge part of why I still do the pub crawl is because I don't have to do
00:37:19 anything all I have to do is show up and drink and talk to my friend you know
00:37:24 and it's the way I keep up with Cider I don't really talk to him outside the
00:37:27 pub crawl except for like a few lines here and there you know each week because
00:37:32 I know that we'll catch up on the pub crawl and we'll have all the stuff to say
00:37:34 there so so like with DeVoo it's like I hang out with them every day there's not
00:37:40 a huge incentive for us to do a show together so yeah that's why those shows
00:37:47 may or may not continue and this one like a lot of what I expressed on this
00:37:52 show is is gonna get repetitive it's gonna end up being a lot of the same
00:37:56 stories it's gonna be the same thoughts about life and I could I'm not
00:38:02 dissatisfied with this shows view count at all I like both the nature of the
00:38:06 show and the the view count on it but I would you know if if if I get into other
00:38:14 stuff and this podcast is in the way or if this podcast waned a little bit and
00:38:18 viewer retention I'd just cancel it you know there's not a huge need for this
00:38:22 show to run forever because it will eventually wear out its welcome but
00:38:30 we'll see how long that takes I'm thinking maybe it'll just be a one
00:38:33 season thing like a 12 episode like a you know like a proper show maybe a
00:38:37 season that could be renewed in the future if I feel the need for it again
00:38:41 I mean when I started this thing it was because I really felt I needed to relax
00:38:45 and decompress and the best way I could think to do that with the was with the
00:38:49 podcast now I don't really feel I need it anymore now I'm just kind of doing it
00:38:53 for kicks you know and occasionally when I have a thought that I go oh that
00:38:57 thought would make a decent podcast let's talk about that so I had a thought
00:39:00 in the car on the way home from getting some pizza just now about happiness and
00:39:07 the nature of it and and and how it's perceived because I really think that
00:39:15 from an outside perspective my life must either look idyllic or crazy it's
00:39:23 gotta be like one of those right either you're thinking well he's living his
00:39:27 dreams he's making you know a good income he's doing exactly what he wants to do
00:39:32 what more could you want or you think that's no way to live you know being in
00:39:38 your room all day not talking to anyone a slave to your work you know it can look
00:39:45 one way or the other and it's funny because I think that for every
00:39:50 individual I think there's two different ways that we kind of interpret how
00:39:53 happy are we there's there's comparing to your own life and then comparing to the
00:40:00 social construct or like what you're what you think happiness is supposed to
00:40:04 look like so for a lot of people they have a time in their life when they were
00:40:10 more happy than they currently are and that kind of becomes their their
00:40:14 benchmark that becomes their baseline Ben Saint was just talking about this on
00:40:19 the latest procrastinators podcast when he the graduation one where he was
00:40:23 saying that his senior year of college was kind of the good old days because
00:40:27 that was when he was the most socially active you know was getting late all the
00:40:32 time was having a good time and he was like you know when I compare current
00:40:36 like my current self to then like there's clearly something missing in
00:40:40 comparison so I must not be as happy as I was then for me I've never had a time
00:40:46 in my life where I was happier than I am now there's nothing I there I have no
00:40:50 grounds for comparison that's why I always tell people that I'm happy you
00:40:53 know and when people ask I'm like yeah things are going great because I can't
00:40:56 even remember things being better than this but on the social construct level
00:41:00 on the what my vision is of what like my life is supposed to be I'm not there yet
00:41:05 because in my vision of what my life is supposed to be you know I I have I have
00:41:12 a girlfriend or a wife or maybe even kids you know I want to have those things
00:41:17 in the future I want to have a family and my own place you know a self-sustained
00:41:24 living which I could afford right now but to me it's like that comes later you
00:41:30 know like I don't think it's important for me to be self-sustained right now
00:41:34 but it is an eventuality I want I want to be living in a house with my wife and
00:41:39 kid not with a bunch of roommates you know who I work with I want them to be
00:41:45 able to afford their own places I want all of us to be able to afford our own
00:41:49 place and be stable living you know in it in a neighborhood together kind of
00:41:53 thing that's my vision of what it would mean to really be happy not to say that
00:42:00 I'm not happy now but just that like that's the thing I'm that I feel like
00:42:04 I'm working towards and that until I have it I will never be convinced that this
00:42:09 is the right way to live you know even though for all intents and purposes like
00:42:15 I'm doing what I want to do you know there's there's nothing there's something
00:42:19 bad happening to me right now there's nothing I'm like struggling with but
00:42:24 there's there's something I want you know and I can't feel satisfied not
00:42:30 having it and the the the weirdest thing about it is that the thing I don't
00:42:34 have is something I have no idea how to get like I think when it came to this
00:42:41 whole creative career for a long time I didn't know how to get it for a long time
00:42:46 I was just sitting around on my ass like trying to figure something out for all
00:42:51 those years I spent as a neat you know or in high school or college wishing I
00:42:57 could be the whole time I was in high school I wanted to drop out the whole
00:43:00 time I was in college I wanted to drop out eventually I did the whole time for a
00:43:04 whole year and a half after that I spent going well you dropped out you're free
00:43:10 you've got all the time in the world what are you doing you know where are you
00:43:15 where is this going man where you going with this is this gonna happen are you
00:43:20 gonna do whatever the thing is and then eventually I figured it out I found the
00:43:25 solution and then I just worked at it constantly until it until I was there and
00:43:29 now I'm there and I'm going okay well I see the next peak you know I see the
00:43:35 next thing I want and I do it's not that I don't want more success I do and I
00:43:42 especially want it for my friends like for DeVu DeVu needs more money if you
00:43:47 want to donate to my patreon and DeVu's pointed this out in the comments on these
00:43:51 before he said don't let Digi's complacency over money stop you from
00:43:55 donating because I still need money you know like DeVu makes 40% of whatever I
00:44:01 make on patreon so you know if you give me more money you're also paying him and
00:44:06 because I a you know make a little bit more and b I spend less than he does on
00:44:13 food oddly enough well okay not overall I spend way more on like groceries and
00:44:18 shit I mean on going out he spends more on groceries okay never mind I spend way
00:44:24 more money than he does but I make a little bit more than him on patreon and
00:44:29 I make ad revenue and I you know make crunchy roll stuff and I also like just
00:44:34 have a big savings because I I save up lots of money DeVu needs money so you
00:44:40 know by all means continue contributing for his sake and I can also pay more
00:44:44 people if I have more money but for me personally in like terms of what I want
00:44:49 out of my life I'm not like hugely trying to get to the next money peak if I
00:44:54 was you'd know because my main channel would be bursting at the seams with
00:44:59 content about current anime the way that it was early this year you know early
00:45:04 this year when I was making videos about erased and cabineri and all that shit
00:45:08 like and in myriad colors phantom world that was all to grow the channel you know
00:45:12 that was all I need more money than I have right now and then I made that much
00:45:16 money and I went all right let's do whatever the fuck we want now shinbo in
00:45:19 the 90s no one watches it don't care it's happening you know let's make it
00:45:26 16 videos that no one's gonna watch I don't fucking care you know it's for me
00:45:32 but if I wanted if I if I did want my channel to grow I know how to do that
00:45:38 it's easy you just talk about relevant shit you know you just make videos at a
00:45:43 quick rate about relevant subject matter you're done that's it you know had I
00:45:49 covered re-zero properly instead of as a plebe and weeb video would probably have
00:45:54 five times the views it has you know but I didn't want to do that I wanted to
00:45:58 plebe and weeb I like I wanted that show to exist it does it's funded for a
00:46:02 second season rad cons coming in January huge deal you know so that's not
00:46:10 what I'm looking for out of life right now what I want is the other things the
00:46:15 relationship the the the the feeling of of being on my own to some extent of
00:46:23 like being my own man kind of thing which I mean I basically am but I don't
00:46:30 want to get out there you know a little bit more and that's the that's the only
00:46:36 part that that like when if you ask me are you happy I'm gonna go yeah I'm
00:46:40 happy but I'm not satisfied you know and I don't think I ever will be I don't
00:46:45 think anyone ever is you get to that next peak and you're just gonna find
00:46:49 something else you know there's got to be something else you want but um so so
00:46:55 maybe I'm as happy as I ever will be and that's really the debate that I
00:46:58 constantly have with myself it's like I tell myself I want these other things
00:47:02 but I'm so convinced that once I get them it's just gonna be about chasing the
00:47:07 next high you know it's never going to be oh I did it I got it all now it's all
00:47:13 cool you know that day is never coming it's never coming for anybody so it's
00:47:19 just a fantasy but I have to you know clinging to that's what keeps you what
00:47:23 keeps you going because if I just decided well this is as happy as I'll ever be
00:47:26 then it's like what new things can I ever expect to be on the horizon you know
00:47:32 and I realize these are all kind of cliched sentiments that you've probably
00:47:37 heard before but but it's it's true you know and like I said a story is nothing
00:47:42 but sort of a re-encapsulation of the same ideas and a lot of this is what
00:47:47 that story that I'm working on that I talked about in the earlier part of
00:47:50 this podcast is dedicated to exploring not in as direct terms as I've painted it
00:47:58 but this I honestly think that this story I'm working on is kind of a
00:48:03 fictionalization of the decompression chamber it's it's it's a similar style
00:48:10 of presentation well not of presentation but of ideas like the
00:48:15 kinds of things that the story will be exploring are the same kinds of things
00:48:18 that I talk about on this podcast it's really going to be dedicated to how this
00:48:25 character the main character of the story like thinks about their life and how
00:48:31 exploring what is going on in their life and what that ultimately means to them
00:48:36 emotionally and so not like most of what happens in this story is not
00:48:44 particularly noteworthy it's not so much about what happens as what of what
00:48:50 that thing happening signifies about this person's personality you know it's
00:48:55 not necessarily exciting for me to say like I did this thing but when you think
00:49:00 of it in the greater context of like how I think about that thing I did that's
00:49:04 where it becomes interesting if you catch my drift how about I put it this way
00:49:09 if I say I watched Kill La Kill and I liked it not a very interesting sentiment
00:49:16 but if I say I watched Kill La Kill and I liked it because of you know how it made
00:49:21 me think about something else then that can be interesting that's sort of vague
00:49:27 but that's what the story is kind of like I don't want to give too much away
00:49:31 about it but I think that the audience who will be most primed to understand
00:49:37 this game and where it's coming from did I say game this thing and where it's
00:49:41 coming from they will be the people who listen to this show the people who
00:49:48 listen to decompression chamber will probably most readily get exactly what
00:49:52 this game yeah why do I keep saying game they will get exactly what this thing
00:49:57 is ignore the fact that I said game because that maybe a mischaracterization
00:50:06 um nonetheless you guys will get it I'm repeating myself I should be probably
00:50:14 doing something right now it's very humid in my room I feel like shit physically
00:50:21 by the way I'm just gonna talk about that a little bit that for the past week I
00:50:24 felt like garbage I've been smoking too much I need to stop again because when
00:50:29 when that whole thing happened with the vape where I broke the vape and then I
00:50:33 immediately like something clicked in my brain when I broke that vape which it's
00:50:38 been fixed now for a while but when I broke it something snapped and the part
00:50:43 of me that was like I'm vaping to quit smoking just stopped caring like that
00:50:49 that the whole all these years like five years of resistance to smoking full
00:50:56 time five years of smoking like once a day maybe twice and then quitting if I
00:51:01 even get close to three times that part of my brain just died when that vape
00:51:06 broke and I started smoking way more and even after the vape was fixed I have
00:51:13 continued smoking and now I like I'm smoking more than I'm vaping and it's
00:51:18 like it's kind of the point where now it's starting to affect the way my
00:51:21 brain feels and I'm like okay hold on that's that that little that little
00:51:27 worry guy is reforming the guy who I killed when the break the vape broke he
00:51:31 starting to come back to life and realize that this is a problem I should
00:51:36 not be smoking this much so I'm gonna quit that again that's gonna be rough
00:51:40 but you know especially cuz it's gonna be rougher than ever before because if
00:51:43 it's smoking more than ever before but it needs to stop after I finish this pack
00:51:47 I'm gonna go to just straight vaping and and just yeah quit smoking again
00:51:54 cuz it's starting to affect the way my brain feels I've also just not been
00:51:59 eating well me and Ben haven't worked out in like two weeks we just completely
00:52:02 dropped the ball on that it's been raining a lot and I get headaches when
00:52:06 it rains that's a fucking obnoxious thing and also the weather is all the fuck
00:52:11 over the place it got really cold it had got it had finally gotten like winter
00:52:15 cold and I was like I had considered stopping smoking then because it got so
00:52:20 cold the standing outside sucked so I was like well this is not fun anymore you
00:52:24 know I'm gonna stop doing this but then it suddenly got fucking way warm today
00:52:29 it's like 70 or something it's not even chilly outside and it's December so the
00:52:34 weather is all over the fucking place it won't stop raining it's always wet I've
00:52:38 always got a fucking headache yeah so I felt I have felt physically completely
00:52:46 off for like probably five or six days now and that fucking sucks that makes
00:52:51 everything else difficult I mean thankfully as I said in the first part
00:52:55 of this I work on such autopilot at this point that I can I can still get
00:52:59 things done it used to be there was a time even in my video making career where
00:53:04 if I felt off I could not work and that was kind of often you know like
00:53:09 probably at least a day out of every week I just felt not up to life I just
00:53:15 felt like either my stomach hurt or I had a headache or I just felt this sort of
00:53:20 dysphoria with my own life like not understanding who I am or why I'm here
00:53:25 and in that mood I'm not good at creating things but these days I'm just so
00:53:30 used to it that nothing can stop me I mean the last like three days all three
00:53:34 of those days individually I thought I'm not getting anything done today I feel
00:53:39 sick and I slept for most of the day and I still managed to make something
00:53:44 because I can't help myself like yesterday I'm like I feel like shit I
00:53:49 don't want to do anything I guess I'll just play sort of mana I guess I'll edit
00:53:53 this entire handfuls of Zen video I guess that's out and then I went and
00:53:57 passed out like immediately afterwards I think I passed out listening to it I
00:54:01 think I put it on and did not survive the whole video it was either that or
00:54:07 something else that I listened to in the same way I think it was that I think I
00:54:10 passed out listening to handfuls of Zen gross I feel terrible but you know
00:54:16 doesn't affect you guys you still get content and and here's another thing
00:54:24 please guys don't do this thing where you try to extrapolate more psycho
00:54:33 analysis out of the things I've said than what I've already presented because
00:54:36 this these shows I do this is already a psychoanalysis of myself and I've
00:54:42 already come to conclusions about myself and I'm presenting them here and then
00:54:46 I'll get people who comment things that kind of like take it a step further but
00:54:50 that's not how I feel like I've already taken it as far as it can go you know
00:54:55 this is already a full-blown examination of how I feel so extrapolating more out
00:55:01 of it can be bothersome and here's an example of what I mean like and I get
00:55:04 this in response to a lot of the issues I bring up in my life where people will
00:55:09 say it sounds like you're burned out it sounds like you burned yourself out like
00:55:13 you've been doing too many of whatever it is if I say I can't find any anime I
00:55:18 really love people say well it sounds like you burned out from watching too much
00:55:21 anime or if I say I can't find any uh like you know I'm getting stressed out
00:55:26 from working so much you burned you burned out if I was burned out I'd say
00:55:29 so I know that feeling I know what burning out feels like I know what it's
00:55:34 like to be sick of anime you know when I was reading all those comics I was a
00:55:38 little burned out on anime like that was and I said so I was like I'm kind of
00:55:42 burned out on watching seven out of tens I'm gonna watch or go read comics
00:55:46 right now I'm not burned out on anime I haven't been fucking watching any for a
00:55:49 little while I just want to see a new favorite you know that's just something
00:55:52 I want to experience that's why I said so I didn't say I'm burned out on anime
00:55:56 and when I talk about anytime I talk about how many projects I'm doing and
00:56:00 like if I say something like I feel physically sick people will say maybe
00:56:04 it's because of all the projects you're working on but the thing is that that's
00:56:09 a constant in my life at times when I feel amazing it's often attributable to
00:56:14 the fact that I'm working on so many things at once you know the beginning of
00:56:17 the decompression chamber I was talking about how like yeah man I've been
00:56:20 I've been making a thousand videos and working out and all this other stuff
00:56:23 I mean this is something this is just my lifestyle I'm just super productive
00:56:27 and I feel way worse when I'm not making things like in a lot of ways my happiness
00:56:34 and self-worth are tied to how many fucking things I can get done so the
00:56:39 physical illness is definitely not a result
00:56:43 of the working of the overworking it's a result of everything surrounding it
00:56:47 it's a result of a bad diet not working out anymore
00:56:51 uh you know frustrating climate it never is the right temperature in my room
00:56:58 um because when it gets cold I put on the heat
00:57:02 but then the heat goes stronger to my room than it does to the rest of the
00:57:04 house so then it just gets really hot then I
00:57:07 turn it off and it gets really fucking cold there's no winning with the the
00:57:11 heat in my house and then today because of a situation I won't even get into
00:57:16 where I was on hold for an hour and a half trying to call into the dick show
00:57:19 I uh I fucking had my window open and I because I I was stressed out because
00:57:26 I've been vaping for half an hour like non-stop and then I my fucking vapes
00:57:31 battery died so I smoked a cigarette in my room
00:57:34 and I had the windows open to let the smoke out which did not work
00:57:38 I left them open for like an hour smoke room still full of smoke
00:57:41 and it's humid as shit because I had the window open and it's been raining
00:57:44 so now I've got like maximum humidity in here so I just
00:57:48 that's why I feel physically wrong you know it has nothing to do with the work
00:57:52 it's the work environment it's how I treat myself and my body
00:57:56 and how the weather treats me you know those are the reasons I feel sick
00:58:02 so just I just don't I just I I know that people
00:58:07 worry about me sometimes and sometimes that's okay
00:58:11 worry about me for the reasons stated not for the other reasons that you've
00:58:15 read into it because believe me I know how to psychoanalyze
00:58:20 myself you know it's something I've been doing my whole
00:58:23 life and I've had I've been to psychologists I've
00:58:26 been through all the ring moral I I've studied psychology
00:58:31 I I think I know what's wrong with me better than anyone
00:58:34 you know and when I feel something's wrong I state it
00:58:38 I state what I think is wrong that's not to say I share absolutely everything
00:58:42 but you know you're not if it's something I'm not sharing you're not
00:58:46 going to extrapolate it from the things I've said you know
00:58:50 so yeah that's just something I find a little bit annoying it's not that big
00:58:54 a deal because I know it's well-meaning I know people just
00:58:57 want to help but I I do feel like when someone says
00:59:01 oh it sounds like you're doing this I'm like no I'm doing what I said I was
00:59:04 doing you know the problem is exactly as stated
00:59:08 and and so much of it is because people are reading in
00:59:11 what would be the problem for them you know it's always someone saying like
00:59:16 I especially get this when people like have the really far-reaching ones where
00:59:19 it's like a like a some kind of mental issue they think I might have where it's
00:59:23 always exactly the one they have you know or
00:59:26 like did you I know you're probably burning out because I burn out all the
00:59:30 time and this happened like yeah that's you
00:59:32 I you know I get it but it's it's it's a little annoying
00:59:37 anyway that's enough for that point I'll probably record one more section of
00:59:41 this at some point and release it later because PCP came out today I don't want
00:59:45 to sandwich the releases together even though this is an hour
00:59:49 already but you know maybe I'll have something else to talk about tomorrow
00:59:54 who knows
01:00:04 oh baby I sure am glad that I decided to hold off
01:00:10 on releasing this podcast because if I got a story for you guys
01:00:15 a fun little piece of shat and Freud for all you
01:00:19 fucking tech geeks out there who are going to lose
01:00:22 your shit hearing this little this little what I spent six hours on today
01:00:29 oh god so um you know in light of me trying to become
01:00:36 a draw boy I decided to buy a tablet and not just any tablet but a one with a
01:00:43 screen the the big the big boy expensive
01:00:46 tablets um you know I had I had a Wacom bamboo
01:00:51 that I bought way back in like when I back when I worked at Target it was one
01:00:56 of the first things I bought because when I first started making videos for
01:01:00 YouTube I thought I was going to teach myself to do
01:01:03 animations because I wanted to be ego raptor
01:01:07 and do sequelitis didn't really work out I didn't end up using the tablet much
01:01:11 and eventually it stopped working after sitting in shades room for a couple of
01:01:16 years and getting abused um it doesn't work anymore
01:01:20 so I decided I want to buy one of these ones at the screen partly because
01:01:24 uh fellow pcp member Tom who runs the rebel pixels channel has been doing
01:01:30 all these videos on Cintiq alternatives all these you know tablets with
01:01:34 screens that are uh that don't cost as much
01:01:37 so he just put out a holiday buyer's guide his mid-range one was the d13
01:01:42 the artisal and so I bought one uh for 500 bucks
01:01:46 and it showed up it's fucking massive it's way bigger than I thought it was
01:01:51 going to be it's beautiful uh so I decided to try and
01:01:55 hook it up now the artisal it has this driver you
01:02:05 know you have to you have to install a driver to make it work
01:02:08 but the driver will not install unless you don't have any other tablet drivers
01:02:13 on your computer so I'm trying to install this driver
01:02:17 and it's not working it keeps telling me that it's detecting another tablet
01:02:20 driver so I start going this took hours hours of
01:02:27 going a shit through my computer trying to find these
01:02:30 fucking tablet drivers because they're not in the uninstall list
01:02:33 they're not in my programs list I I fucking I
01:02:37 uninstalled drivers for like every device that had ever been plugged into my
01:02:41 computer that wasn't currently plugged into it you know I went found all the
01:02:44 hidden drivers I'm saying all this because I know
01:02:48 that someone someone listening who's a tech expert
01:02:52 is going to say well did you try this did you try that
01:02:55 yes I spent hours googling everything you can possibly do
01:02:59 and trying everything now the only thing that's anywhere in my computer that I
01:03:05 could find that even resembles a tablet driver is this
01:03:09 windows driver it's like part of a windows driver pack
01:03:13 and it says graphics tablet on it so I was like okay
01:03:17 this seems to be it but if you try to uninstall that
01:03:20 it's in the uninstall list but when you try to uninstall it it says that it
01:03:23 doesn't exist it says you don't even have this thing on your
01:03:26 computer I don't know why it's listed in the uninstall
01:03:28 list but it claims I don't even have it
01:03:32 and it would give me this error message you know I'm searching around I find
01:03:35 other people who've had the same issue but no one's really resolved it
01:03:39 and I'm looking at all this information about how to uninstall drivers
01:03:42 so what I end up doing is going into the command prompt
01:03:47 getting a driver's list as a text file
01:03:51 fucking you know control effing my way through there and finding anything that
01:03:55 says tablet on it and there are two different things but they're both system
01:03:58 32 drivers right so I go into system 32 I learn how to
01:04:04 change permissions on files and I go into the drivers
01:04:10 and I delete two of them first one nothing changed
01:04:15 second one nothing changes in regards to the tablet
01:04:20 but I now can't connect to the internet so
01:04:25 what I believe I did was I misread the drivers list
01:04:30 and uninstalled or deleted some other driver
01:04:34 and of course I didn't know about system restore before doing any of this
01:04:37 so I didn't set a restore point for my computer which would have solved this
01:04:41 whole problem um well this it wouldn't have solved
01:04:45 the the weird tablet driver problem but it wouldn't have
01:04:48 it would have not made it so I just uninstalled or deleted a system 32 file
01:04:53 that makes it so I can't connect to the internet and no one's sure why
01:04:56 and there's no way to replace it or anything turns out
01:04:59 uh manipulating system 32 files such an uncommon occurrence
01:05:05 that no one on the internet has helped for it uh you can't just download system
01:05:10 32 drivers and put them on your computer that that's
01:05:14 not a thing apparently I go what I start doing is
01:05:19 taking all the drivers from my laptop system 32 put those on a flash drive
01:05:24 put them all in my computer didn't help um
01:05:28 this is the over the course of hours by the way at this point I've got shade
01:05:31 helping me shades got windows 7 but even after changing permissions I can't
01:05:35 write any of his system files onto a flash drive for some reason it won't
01:05:38 give me permission eventually I remember hey wait a minute
01:05:43 my computer is partitioned between two different
01:05:47 solid state drives at the time I'd forgotten the other one the solid
01:05:50 state but because when my computer was built it
01:05:53 had a 250 gigabyte solid state drive and I later wanted to upgrade to a
01:05:58 terabyte one so I've been using the terabyte
01:06:00 there's a 250 gig one that's still in there and it still has all the
01:06:04 it's exactly as it was before I bought the new one you know we
01:06:08 didn't delete anything off of it or anything thank god because
01:06:11 originally I bit I was going to format it um and my tech friend was just like
01:06:16 let's not and you know just in case something goes wrong um
01:06:20 we'll wait a few weeks and then we'll we'll do it and I never did
01:06:24 so thank fuck I never formatted the other uh hard drive
01:06:29 because we also we couldn't we couldn't just boot for something like for
01:06:33 whatever reason my my fucking DOS has a password
01:06:39 and I don't know what it is and it's not the password of anything else on my
01:06:44 computer so couldn't get into DOS so we had to
01:06:47 open up the computer and fucking change the damn cords
01:06:50 around also that I could boot off of my old solid state drive
01:06:56 and I tried copying the system 32 files from the from the old solid state to
01:07:01 the new one that didn't work either nothing worked
01:07:04 so now my main my main SSD just can't connect to the internet and no one
01:07:10 knows why so I'm probably gonna have to reinstall
01:07:14 windows on that one which you know I don't want to fucking
01:07:17 go to the process of backing up everything and reinstalling windows
01:07:20 now especially if that doesn't even help the problem
01:07:23 because even after all of this I never solved
01:07:28 the tablet problem I never solved the issue
01:07:31 of it still thinking it has tablet drivers so finally and in the meantime a
01:07:36 mid-stall this happening I plugged the fucking new the tablet into my laptop
01:07:41 and it worked instantly you know like I got the drivers on there it's perfect
01:07:45 and I so I already know the thing works it works just fine
01:07:48 it's just something whatever reason my main SSD
01:07:52 has this problem so we routed to the other SSD
01:07:55 it works on that one um it's I fucking had to deal with
01:07:59 still even though the drivers installed it still took me half an hour to get the
01:08:03 fucking thing to detect the pen for some reason
01:08:06 eventually it was just like a matter of switching which usb port it was plugged
01:08:10 into god it was a waking
01:08:15 nightmare six hours it took before I got this thing working
01:08:19 on my computer and even still it's at the caveat of
01:08:23 I now am just using my old solid state drive I now just have now the one
01:08:30 terabyte is the partitioned one you know just I mean thank god nothing
01:08:34 worse happened with me fucking with system 32 files it
01:08:38 could have been much worse um and you know and and thankfully the
01:08:42 partition is is easily enough that I can just copy like you know I just had to
01:08:46 copy the decompression chamber from the other SSD to this one
01:08:49 and of course this SSD is from like you know I changed I'm like
01:08:53 early in the year so it's got all these like like it's missing a bunch of
01:08:57 programs that I now use and has all this stuff that has to be changed it
01:09:00 remembers all my old passwords and stuff so I have to fucking update
01:09:05 everything now huge fucking pain in the ass but at
01:09:09 least I got the damn thing working Christ
01:09:14 oh god I am the I am the biggest idiot in the world
01:09:20 I fucking immediately after I finally got it to work
01:09:23 I rushed out because I was just like fuming I could not contain
01:09:29 my rage at this point I was like I need to eat I was hungry
01:09:32 had you know been sitting there for six hours working on this thing
01:09:36 so I immediately went out to Arby's bought some big ass
01:09:39 shit which was disgusting I don't know why I did that then I had a cigarette
01:09:43 now I'm having a beer it's like somehow the fact that I had failed so badly
01:09:48 meant I had to continue the failure and just like make it like
01:09:53 if I'm if I'm this retarded I might as well go full in and just eat fast food
01:09:57 and smoke a cigarette and have a beer and just destroy myself I need to die now
01:10:03 oh god
01:10:11 I guess I've had worse tech problems in the past
01:10:14 this is the worst one in a while though anyway I hope you enjoyed that little
01:10:19 story I needed that I needed the decompression this was a real
01:10:23 this became a real decompression chamber at the very end here where I actually
01:10:28 needed to decompress not that that not the telling
01:10:31 that story like I mean it's just there for you to
01:10:35 laugh at me and there's no silver lining to it
01:10:38 but I guess I just needed to vent and now I'm remembering I can't get drunk
01:10:43 yet because I got to go pick up the view at the airport in like four hours so
01:10:47 yes I'll just drink half of this beer and then leave it around
01:10:53 oh see you in the next one
01:12:17 you
