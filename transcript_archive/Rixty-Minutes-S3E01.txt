00:00:00 I don't give a fuck, bitch. Welcome to the first episode of Digibro and Best Guy Ever. That's you.
00:00:07 Dickin' Boardy Time, baby. Yeah, baby, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:00:14 We're talking about Rick and Morty, everybody, season three. Season three. You know, the season
00:00:20 three premiere came out on April 1st on Adult Swim. It was a big deal. Everybody was excited about it.
00:00:25 And we're thinking about maybe talking more about the rest of season three. So here we are
00:00:29 starting things off with that episode. Rick and Morty is like my favorite show ever.
00:00:33 It's just rewatching that episode again just now. It's really hard to argue that that show
00:00:38 isn't like the most dense with high quality content show anywhere right now.
00:00:43 I mean, that's what I love about it. It's so fucking, it's so dense. It's so dense.
00:00:47 Every single shot has so much going on, yeah. It's fantastic. I was a huge fan of the first
00:00:53 season, watched it like five times. Still haven't really rewatched season two. I intended to do
00:00:58 that before three started and three seemingly had snuck up on it. But then it hasn't actually.
00:01:05 It was just a weird April Fools thing. Confused the shit out of me because I was in Atlanta
00:01:10 when it came out. I didn't get the chance to see it. And then every week I was like,
00:01:15 why am I not hearing about the new season of Rick and Morty? Sounds like you were out of it.
00:01:18 I thought I was just missing episodes and no one was telling me somehow. And I was really confused.
00:01:24 So let me just talk about how great this was as an April Fools episode.
00:01:30 So April Fools every year is terrible because everyone tricks you and says like,
00:01:35 hey, I'm going to do this and then I'm not going to do it. And then you're disappointed.
00:01:38 Am I the only one who loves April Fools? Yes. We were all complaining about it,
00:01:42 but me and the rest of the PCP were all shitting on it. I love April Fools because people always,
00:01:45 well, it depends on who it is. Some people just do some bullshit, but I love when people pull out
00:01:51 all the stops to do some crazy shit. That's what makes it good. If you follow the old web
00:01:56 comment XKCD, every year he would do some kind of like insane shit, like turn his entire website
00:02:02 into a fucking text adventure game or something, like some crazy programming shit. Well, that's fine.
00:02:07 It used to be that websites would really go all out and make like a crazy thing for April Fools
00:02:12 Day. And it was always exciting to see like what everybody was doing that day. And I historically
00:02:18 have always made April Fools videos. Well, what you're describing is the good side of April Fools,
00:02:22 but there is the downside, whereas people say like, oh, I'm going like, oh, Half-Life 3 is out.
00:02:28 Wow. I'm so excited. Oh, it's not actually out. Okay, fuck you. But what, I mean, but this episode
00:02:34 is exactly that. Watch the fucking calendars, people. That's all I'm saying. Everyone loves
00:02:39 fucking Rick and Morty. Everyone agrees. It's fantastic too. Like on April Fools, get this like
00:02:43 loop of the new episode that is so legitimately good and well crafted and has, even the episode
00:02:51 itself has a ton of Mr. X as Rick and Morty episodes tend to do. Like this is exactly what an April
00:02:56 Fools should be. We're getting more. We're not being cheated or lied to. We're just getting extra
00:03:01 stuff. That's what you should celebrate about the day. Yeah. I mean, that's the best way to April
00:03:05 Fools is to make an actual surprise. Surprised by people by giving them more shit, by making them
00:03:11 happy as opposed to pissed off. That's what I like. Though personally, I think you should just
00:03:16 know what day it is. It's not hard to know April 1st is coming. I don't know. Maybe because I make a
00:03:21 big deal out of it, like I always have plans for April Fools, so I know it's coming. But that just
00:03:26 means one day of the year, you just be like, oh, everything's a lie today. No one is telling me
00:03:31 the truth today. That's just annoying. I don't want that. Maybe it's a nice change of pace, I guess.
00:03:35 I fucking get pissed off by it. But anyway, forget that. To me, it's like the classic festivals
00:03:41 like the masquerade. No one's themselves today. It's an escape from the normalcy.
00:03:48 And again, I think it's been hurt by the fact that the internet is now real life. There are
00:03:55 real life repercussions of changing everything. Where 10 years ago, YouTube did a thing where
00:04:00 the entire front page, everything linked to Rick Roll. YouTube could never do that now because
00:04:05 it would hurt too many people's careers. That's true. It would be a huge fucking deal. Now,
00:04:10 April Fools is always like some lame shit you have to actually go find.
00:04:13 Yeah. It's like, oh, I already know what it's going to be. I know it's April Fools' day. You
00:04:17 can't fucking trick me today, you know? But I miss when sites would do, I mean,
00:04:23 fucking 4chan still does, like, they'll have a song looping in the background of the entire
00:04:28 fucking website. And you know what, that is annoying, but 4chan is not really essential
00:04:33 for anybody. So that's more okay. It doesn't really interfere with your day.
00:04:37 Anyway, Rick and Morty. Yeah, I feel like that's an appropriate interlude to discuss
00:04:41 Rick and Morty anyway. Well, I don't know how long we plan for these podcasts to be,
00:04:45 but we can go on as long as we need to. There's a pilot episode and we don't know when we're
00:04:49 going to be covering the next one, when it will be out. No one knows when the next episode is
00:04:53 going to be out soon. And I mean, this episode, like the biggest question on everyone's minds is
00:05:00 because it was like season two ended on a huge fucking cliffhanger. How are they going to start
00:05:04 off? You know, they have to open season three with something kind of epic. Yep. And the show
00:05:09 opens up by lampooning this. Of course. It starts off with this joke that they're all in a shoneys,
00:05:15 and oh, who wants to hear about how I escaped from prison? Like, that would be stupid. And like,
00:05:20 it's like, I'll even admit, like, even though I knew I'd heard spoilers for this episode before
00:05:25 I watched it, even though I knew that I still had that reaction of like, oh, you motherfucker.
00:05:30 But then, of course, when it turns out to be a lie, that's like, oh, okay, that's exactly that
00:05:34 April Fool spirit I love. They act like they're fucking you over, and then they give you everything
00:05:39 you want it. And it's so great. Oh, and the actual shit that Rick does, it turns out it was all part
00:05:44 of his fucking plan. And they do this whole rigmarole with all this new technology of like,
00:05:48 mind transferring we haven't seen before. Oh, it's the best. Yeah. So this episode continues
00:05:53 the sort of trend that I saw happening through season two, and especially with the ending of
00:05:58 season two of I feel like Rick and Morty owes a lot to Game of Thrones. Yeah. Like, I think the
00:06:05 way that this show uses like brutal violence is sort of like, because we are now in a, in a culture
00:06:11 where that's like a normal thing on mainstream television, like, like insanely violent scenes
00:06:17 has HBO become mainstream television, or is it just the popularity of the show? Like, yeah,
00:06:22 because HBO now is way more easily accessible. Well, it used to. Torrents are a thing. Well,
00:06:27 yeah, but it, you know, Game of Thrones is the most torrented show of all time. I believe it.
00:06:31 I believe it had like millions and millions of torrents. Yeah, okay. So everyone's everyone's
00:06:36 seen it. Everyone has seen Game of Thrones. It's it's that's the culture where it now is like
00:06:40 that this kind of hyper violent, like crazy dark shit is what gets talked about. And I mean,
00:06:47 the ending of season two was clearly a Game of Thrones parody. It was a red wedding. Yeah, it was
00:06:51 the red wedding like redone in Rick and Morty. And I just love the way the show. It totally like
00:06:59 gets into the headspace of like, who is the audience of Rick and Morty? Like,
00:07:02 what kind of cultural stuff are we? Because like, a lot of the show is in reference to
00:07:07 like, cultural touchstones. Yeah, like, there's lots of movie parodies. There's like a whole
00:07:12 episode on the purge planet. It's like, right, which was great. What would it be like if there's a
00:07:16 planet that does the purge and the way that Riley and matter of fact, we address like what a real
00:07:20 purge planet would be. I mean, in their lampooning way, it's great. It's wonderful. And so when they
00:07:25 do like a red wedding scene, like they know exactly how the audience is going to feel at every step
00:07:30 of the way. And the moment that like really got I mean, that episode is fucking amazing. A lot of
00:07:35 shit happens in that episode. But the moment that got me the most was right after bird person gets
00:07:41 shot. Yeah, then Rick screams like bird person, no. And literally he said that while I was saying,
00:07:49 no bird person. It's like one to one, me and Rick saying it at the same time. And I'm like,
00:07:54 because they knew that that's what the audience was going to do. They knew you were going to yell,
00:07:58 no bird person, you know, and so they they matched it. And it's like, they totally get
00:08:03 the ebb and flow of your feelings and stuff. And like, it's well written, man. It's well written.
00:08:07 There's so many like, there's so much stuff that they've allowed themselves. This show does what
00:08:12 like my little pony fucked up with its background characters. Oh, yeah, you're right. It makes you
00:08:19 care about them in a real way. I mean, in all fairness, it was one episode that was garbage that
00:08:23 pretty much ruined that whole thing. But what I mean is that like in in in MLP fandom, for anybody
00:08:29 who doesn't know, because we're a few years out from it, and people probably don't know what we're
00:08:33 talking about anymore. The fan base of my little pony, like really ran with every random fucking
00:08:40 background character that was in the show. They all had like fan made backstories and like people
00:08:45 had all these ideas about them. And like they each one was a popular character in their own
00:08:49 right, because they would show up in the background all the time or have like one line here and there
00:08:52 and stuff like that. And so all those background characters became kind of famous. And eventually,
00:08:57 the show writers became aware of this. And they kind of tried to do something with it. And it was
00:09:03 terrible. Granted, some people don't agree. Some you know, there were some decent things like the
00:09:07 way they handled the fact that Bon Bon had like two cannon or like there was a fandom name and a
00:09:12 real name. They made her a secret agent with an alias. Like that's one clever way to handle that
00:09:16 kind of a thing. But there were many things that were bad and shitty episode itself. The episode
00:09:20 was garbage. So yeah, yeah, like and just the general way that they tried to like they're trying
00:09:26 to pander to the audience. But it's like they're trying to give us what we are saying we want.
00:09:30 Yeah, Rick and Morty knows what we want and gives it to us in ways we don't expect, such as it's
00:09:36 got all these background characters who people just naturally started caring about people love
00:09:40 bird person. People love, you know, all these random weird wacky characters. That fucking
00:09:44 half dude whose name I forget. Squanch. Squanch, yeah. Squanchie. And instead of like giving us
00:09:51 some fan service episode, or it's like, Hey, it's all your favorite background characters.
00:09:54 They murder all of them. Yeah. And it makes it even more memorable, because it's like instead of
00:10:00 just like, Oh, here's bird person again, we know you love bird person. Here you go. Have as much
00:10:05 bird person as you want. No, like the second or third episode he's in, he gets fucking shot and
00:10:10 dies. Yeah. And it's like, because they know you actually do care about him in this weird way,
00:10:15 this guy with like two lines, but he's such an endearing character that when he gets shot, you're
00:10:18 like, Oh, no, not bird person. But it's, it's also that like, they can get away with that because
00:10:26 it doesn't it never feels too dark because of the fact that they're all just dumb background
00:10:30 characters. Yeah. Like a guy, you see a guy get shot whose name is like Schmoopy Doop or something,
00:10:35 or Poopy Butthole. Poopy, Mr. Poopy Butthole. Yeah. You know, like, like it's the scene is like
00:10:42 drawing out like this pathos and everything. And it's everyone's crying, it's like that. Like,
00:10:46 on some level, it hits you emotionally, because you kind of care about Poopy Butthole. Not to
00:10:51 mention, but it's not like they murdered your favorite character who you really care about.
00:10:55 And a lot of that has to do with the way that Rick himself is such like an anti social,
00:10:59 you know, whatever, misanthrope. And I'm using that word right, the one who hates people. Yeah.
00:11:04 Yeah, I was wondering if it's the one who hates men. I'm not saying that. It's the other thing.
00:11:07 But like the way he doesn't give a fuck about anyway, about anyone and the way that he does
00:11:11 react when bird person dies, and like continually has this relationship with him. And he talks about
00:11:15 like, Yeah, we fought in the war. It's like, we're buddies to actually have that character care about
00:11:18 someone makes us care about them to and makes their death all the more impactful. So from that
00:11:23 perspective, too, it really works. I definitely think that like, because Rick is presented as
00:11:29 someone who's like, so yeah, over the edge and like doesn't care about anything. Yeah,
00:11:33 anytime he emotes, right, it feels serious. Like it's that much more impactful. Like when he
00:11:38 like the fucking self an episode. Yeah, after dating that girl and having been like cut off. Oh my
00:11:43 God. And I do Jesse freaks out about that episode. That one's devastating. Oh my God. Just because
00:11:47 it's like Legion. No, whatever. You just like, oh my God, it's like, yeah, he does like that.
00:11:54 My favorite thing about Rick and Morty and I know Tom, Tommy Oliver had a problem with this
00:11:59 aspect of the show. He thought it was ruining Rick showed so much emotion. That's my favorite thing
00:12:04 about the show is that there is this like, like at heart, he is highly empathetic. And the reason
00:12:10 that he the reason he acts this way isn't because he hates people. It's because I think he cares too
00:12:15 much about people. And he knows that like, the universe is an unchanging, unfeeling, you know,
00:12:21 like monstrous place, like caring about people is just going to lead to pain. So don't do it.
00:12:25 It's like he's a man who's gained the knowledge of a God and is, you know, aware of how insignificant
00:12:30 everything is. It's really fucked him up. Yeah, he's like, you know, how can I bring myself to
00:12:34 give a shit about people when I know what's going like that they are nothing, you know, but then
00:12:39 like he can't help himself because he is still human. That's true. So like sometimes he has,
00:12:45 he can't help but care, you know, and like if he really falls in love, like he did in that episode
00:12:49 and loses out and and I mean, it's not even just that it's also he's drunk and yeah, it's too
00:12:55 emotional, you know, and like he's fucked up on drugs and shit. And it's like, yeah, that's the
00:13:00 moment when you're like he could have easily killed himself that if he hadn't passed out. He really
00:13:04 tried he really put his best effort really like did it and just failed. The fact that he didn't
00:13:09 push out he went all the way and really tried to do it. I mean, it's been said, but that's such
00:13:13 intense moment, great scene. And yeah, and then when we see like with this at the end of season
00:13:18 two, when he's like, what are you in for? And he says everything. It's like, you know, I've
00:13:23 like he finally realizes, you know, I can't bring myself to say I don't care about my family.
00:13:27 But of course, of course, all this, I mean, you know, we were saying this to but all this,
00:13:31 you can you can compare to is in parallel to how like him turning himself in at the end of the
00:13:36 second of season, you know, to supposedly save his family and like, you know, give them back
00:13:42 the life that he stoned from it was actually I mean, and it's kind of ambiguous, but it seems
00:13:46 like it was actually all part of a plan to depose Jerry as patriarch of the family and become like
00:13:52 the ruler and get more to exclusively because he's so evil and fucked up. That's the thing about it
00:13:58 is that with Rick, you can never say for sure. And I mean, I personally think that like,
00:14:04 I think that he is ultimately empathetic because we've seen him do it in moment like
00:14:08 when he tried to kill himself, no one was there to witness that there was no benefit to that.
00:14:13 When he goes back, like the first moment we really see Rick act that way is when Morty gets like
00:14:18 almost raped by the Jellybean King. And Rick, when he realizes that Morty is upset, he like changes
00:14:25 gears and like tries to comfort him and like leads him and then he shoots the Jellybean King just
00:14:30 out of anger. I love the fact that he murdered that guy because he deserved it. He didn't push
00:14:35 the out. Well, that's that's one of my favorite scenes in the show because the fact that it's like
00:14:38 it shows that Rick like on even though he doesn't care in general, like he saw something happening
00:14:44 right in front of him to someone he does kind of care about. And so he was like, well, I can do
00:14:48 something about this. I can kill that guy. You know, that kind of speaks to a fundamental like
00:14:53 psychological, you know, facet that humans have where we're much more empathetic about things
00:14:58 that are directly in front of us as opposed to like news that there are billions of people dying
00:15:02 elsewhere. Well, because it just when you hear how big it is, you're like, I can't do anything about
00:15:07 that. But even it's interesting. It's just like, oh, well, I literally know I can do something about
00:15:11 this because it's right in front of me. It's interesting to me that even a character like
00:15:14 Rick, who is the smartest man in the universe, even he like retains that perspective, that very
00:15:20 human perspective. And that's the thing, like when you meet first meet the Council of Rick's and
00:15:25 everything, it's established that he's like right on the edge between like being the evil.
00:15:31 If you're slightly more evil than him, you're an evil fucking master villain. But if you're
00:15:36 slightly more righteous than him, then you're like a little bit like he's right in the perfect
00:15:43 interstice to be the most interesting Rick, which is why we follow this right. Right. Right. It's
00:15:49 really he's a who's a real reflection of humanity, like a certain perspective of what a human being
00:15:54 is. You can see in that. It's real cool. So I this episode accomplishes a lot of things that I
00:16:02 wanted to have like, okay, after season one of Rick and Morty, like my biggest thing that I wanted
00:16:08 to happen in season two was for Beth and Jerry to split up. Right. Like because the way I saw it was
00:16:14 like season one was constantly suggesting it. And like this is a show that has plot progression.
00:16:18 So like, let's do it. Let's do away with this nuclear family dynamic. Like, you know, because
00:16:24 the first season was constantly bouncing between like home life and crazy sci fi A plot. Yeah.
00:16:30 And like, it did sometimes feel a little restricted by the fact that it had to do like normal shit.
00:16:35 The cutaways to the Jerry and Beth bits are almost every time the worst part of the episode.
00:16:40 Yeah, even when they're good, like even when they're good, the Gazorp is or stuff with them is
00:16:44 actually great and is probably the best part of that particular episode. But not every time they
00:16:48 are, you know, in general, they're the weakest part or the the the TV episode. Did I say Gazorp
00:16:53 is or I meant to say Mr. Meeseeks. I meant to say Mr. Meeseeks. Oh, yeah, that's fantastic. Yeah.
00:16:57 Yeah. Like, so it's just that it felt very explored in season one. So I was really hoping
00:17:03 that season two would like start off with them getting divorced. Yeah, it didn't happen. Instead,
00:17:07 season two went even heavier on the divorce element. And like, again, it had ultimately the
00:17:12 episodes were good. But I was just like, I get it. Yeah, like, I want these two split up because
00:17:17 this is going to go on forever. And like, I feel like we've done everything we can with it. Yeah.
00:17:21 So the fact that this episode, a big part of it is getting Jerry out of the picture. And like,
00:17:26 the way that Rick talks to Morty at the end is obviously meta. He's like describing to Rick or
00:17:31 to Morty, like, we have done this as writers, we are writing Jerry out of the show to get rid of
00:17:37 him because we're sick of him. I still though, in the context of a character saying these things
00:17:41 to Morty, it's just so so wonderfully black and dark and evil. It's great. It's fantastic. It's
00:17:47 like your father was your father crossed your father and the entire galactic government crossed
00:17:52 me. So I got rid of them both. That's what a fucking badass. That's so sick. God, I love Rick.
00:17:59 What I love about this show is it's never content to just be status quo. Like,
00:18:04 like, um, I mean, that's what most most episodic comedy shows like this, you know,
00:18:10 they have to have this baseline thing they can always return to this sense of normalcy that's
00:18:14 kind of in the background. And it can be hard to change that and break away from it. And like,
00:18:19 I was really scared that after season two, like, are we always going to have this Beth Jerry thing
00:18:24 going on? Like this is getting tiring, you know, and they did some like, like episode two of season
00:18:29 two where they had Jerry in the daycare was fucking genius. Yeah, that's a great one. That's a great
00:18:34 way to do a Jerry B plot. But like, um, you know, Jerry's a he can't develop as a character because
00:18:40 it would defeat the point. That's right. He's a character who's like inherently static. And
00:18:44 he's boring now. So let's get rid of them. And they did, they cut him out. And I'm like, I fully
00:18:49 expect him to not show up throughout season three. Yeah, I think we'll a little undercut what they're
00:18:53 going for here if he just was back. Exactly. And, uh, and then they're also doing away with the
00:18:58 Rick Federation thing, because obviously that's limiting in a way that like it always puts Rick,
00:19:03 like there's there's a definitive opposition he has. Yeah, that's always around. And it's like,
00:19:08 we've explored a lot of it. And I mean, it's not that they couldn't have done more with it,
00:19:12 but like having it there means like there's certain rules we've established like Rick can't do this
00:19:16 because the council will intervene. There's certain things that like we've made it. So
00:19:20 if, if this or this happens, we have to involve these characters. And so I see the writers going,
00:19:25 all right, that's too limiting. We want to do crazy or shit. We want to make it so Rick can do
00:19:29 those things. It's very exciting that they're changing things on such a level. That's really
00:19:33 is a good sign. So now we've taken out like the entire power structure of the universe.
00:19:38 Yeah, the galactic government and the rest of the things. Yeah, right. Like from here,
00:19:41 the show can go anywhere. And there's nothing that's, there's no like system that was in place
00:19:46 that's going to hold it back from doing my only kind of fear was that they really had established,
00:19:51 like those were, as you were saying, like they were the highest level authorities that existed.
00:19:55 And it's a little hard to imagine like what could easily replace those. It's going to take
00:19:58 some creativity. So I highly anticipate what you say. I wouldn't be surprised if we got like,
00:20:04 you know, Rick forming a new government himself or something. Well, there's no Rick would be.
00:20:08 I mean, he might do that just to like deal with the problem and then divorce himself from it because
00:20:12 he can't be involved in bureaucracy. Not at all. But like, yeah, just like he did with the with
00:20:17 the devil shop. Maybe it just turns the fucking whole world completely anarchic or the whole
00:20:21 universe goes to anarchy or something, you know, like, you know, that's maybe this whole season
00:20:25 is just like batshit insanity all the time. The only reason I think they won't go that way is
00:20:30 because that is a little bit harder to write for than I expect them to go for. Yeah. I mean,
00:20:35 there is a bit of a formula here that I think they generally want to stick to.
00:20:40 Yeah, I'm just really curious where we're going to go with with no Jerry and no, no Rick council,
00:20:46 which like, you know, it's it's almost sad because like the Rick council is such a cool
00:20:51 I know I loved it that I could have watched it forever. It's such that at the same time. Yeah,
00:20:54 it's really ballsy to just kill like to take this great idea and say we've done all we want to do
00:20:59 with it. Let's just like make sure you know as a viewer that it's gone. You know, they really
00:21:06 hammered in those points. And I just love I mean, this is just a compliment of the entire show.
00:21:10 How logically consistent everything is like with Rick having an interdimensional portal gun,
00:21:14 of course, there would something like the Rick thing would develop and the way it impacts his
00:21:18 character. Because he has the portal gun, he developed this, you know, lack of care about
00:21:22 anyone and anything in his life because there's literally infinite copies of him. It doesn't
00:21:25 matter what he does at any point. And these ricks are going to form the Federation to live their
00:21:29 like own outside existence outside any kind of like galactic government that existed. It's just
00:21:34 and and everything's just so consistent and wonderful. And it's just why the show is so good.
00:21:38 And continues one of my favorite things about Rick and Morty is how breakneck it is. Yeah,
00:21:44 like, there's the scene where the the Rick Council breaks into the alien thing and just
00:21:49 Rick himself gets shot in the face immediately. Yeah, like our Rick, we see get fucking shot
00:21:56 in the face. And it's like, whoa, you know, but you also kind of know that he just left. So it's
00:22:00 just like, you're barely able to keep up with the things that are happening. It's like, people are
00:22:05 getting shot, people are taking a shit. It's a wild ride, you know. Yeah, take a shit. That was
00:22:12 that's a great recurring thing. I think he's using that as like his I need to leave this room
00:22:15 now and go to other stuff. I got to take a shit. And it's just because no one would question anyone's
00:22:20 saying that. And it's the the great way they use the dialogue and such a snappy pace, like he walks
00:22:25 into the room and is like, whoa, you can't be in here. This is the room where if you press a couple
00:22:28 buttons and knobs, it like teleports the entire Citadel. He's like, well, he probably shouldn't
00:22:32 have designed it that way. Beep, beep, explosion. Yeah, plot moving along and break that immediately.
00:22:37 Like the very first thing you see is it's just a shot of the Citadel reappearing inside what
00:22:41 is clearly the world government. It's just like, yeah, everything's done now. Like what in that one
00:22:47 shot, we totally understand that both of those governments are just gone. You know, it's just
00:22:52 like, well, moving along. And they spoon feed you a little bit, but they're just like, you know,
00:22:56 oh, no, we teleported here. Everything bad's happening. I that's great. It's it's really good.
00:23:01 Yeah. Every all the ricks getting shot, the brutal and more ricks and Morty's getting killed left
00:23:07 and right. And again, it's all like a pre-established background character. So like you care a little
00:23:11 like rest in peace, hammer Morty, rest in peace, hammer Morty is just some weird background like
00:23:16 gag like what if one of the Morty's is a hammer. And this one, we see the Rick wielding the hammer
00:23:21 Morty like beating people to death with it. And then it gets shot like so it serves it's one other
00:23:27 purpose it could have. It has two purposes, one to be a random background gag to die used as a
00:23:32 Shekhov's gun and then to just get killed. It's like perfect. That's all we needed from him.
00:23:37 He never has to show up again. Doesn't have to be like once per season. Oh, here's hammer Morty.
00:23:42 Yeah, like don't don't you don't want to be pulling like a an adventure time style party
00:23:47 God and like try to make this ridiculous character that should show up exactly once
00:23:51 into like a regular character. Yeah, that's the mistake. And they don't do that here. Thank God.
00:23:58 How about that Sejuan sauce? How about well, how about the whole memory sequence where I mean,
00:24:02 I had to watch this twice to really understand what was going on. So he does this whole thing
00:24:06 where so he's been captured and they're trying to extract memories from it. And he's got this like
00:24:10 so Rick immediately figures this out and the way he plays them and you know, they do the fake out
00:24:15 where like they're exploring his memories. They're like, Hey, you better go to the place
00:24:19 where you invented your interdimensional travel gun. And so that he thinks they think that he's
00:24:24 leading them to that. And we see in the midst of that we see like his wife the mysteriously absent
00:24:30 wife mother of of Beth character that everyone's been wondering about. And then like it plays you
00:24:35 the whole way. And then when you get to the end, both the like the way that he came up with the
00:24:39 portal, the interdimensional portal gun and the mother character were both fictional. They were
00:24:44 not real. So they got played and we got played at the same time. I mean, I was suspicious of that
00:24:50 memory because it seemed way too straight like straightforward, right? Yeah, wife and daughter
00:24:55 died. And also why would Beth have gotten blown up? Well, interdimensional, you know, went to
00:25:00 another one, I guess. Yeah. I mean, that was as soon as that happened, I was like, Well, what the
00:25:04 hell? That's not the real story because Beth can't be dead unless he was going to rebuild her. But
00:25:09 like, I mean, we've already seen Rick abandon one Beth and just get a new one. That's true. You
00:25:13 know, we've seen that in the show. Yeah. Incidentally, they we get to see the new the world, the Cronenberg
00:25:17 world that was abandoned, which was great. I love that. The Cronenberg world comes back. And once
00:25:22 again, we bring back the Cronenberg world. It's a great reference to an old joke. Immediately all
00:25:26 three of them get frozen, probably dead. So we don't have to go back there again. Yeah, I am
00:25:31 content to know like, it's good to know what these characters are doing because they were these were
00:25:35 the characters that we grew up with through all season one. And yeah, to see to just see them,
00:25:40 they're doing fine. They're doing fine. Don't worry about it. It makes me happy now. I bet they'll
00:25:44 be okay. I know that actually freezing did like totally will actually kill you, but it's magic
00:25:48 space gun. So in the first episode, someone got frozen and immediately fell and broke to pieces.
00:25:53 They didn't fall and break to pieces. So maybe they're okay. Yeah, by the way, can we talk about
00:25:59 how how great and like, so the thing that we're wondering is so Rick's got his plan, but what
00:26:04 are like Morty and Summer going to do? I mean, I personally was wondering like, what agency
00:26:09 can like Morty and Summer do to like get involved in the plot again? And the idea of digging up the
00:26:13 dead Rick and finding his portal gun that gives them an end back into like actually doing something
00:26:19 relevant in the story, just a really good use of these like dead bodies in the background in the
00:26:23 backyard, really, really good stuff. Yeah, the portal got smashed so they can't use it anymore.
00:26:29 Well, but but that was great because you know that it was a great way to give you something to do.
00:26:32 Yeah. Yeah. I think I really want us to like, I think the number one promise this show made in
00:26:40 season one that hasn't been delivered on is the evil Morty and this, this general idea that I
00:26:47 think our Morty is special, you know, and like Rick says so in that episode as kind of like a
00:26:52 haha, we're buddies kind of thing. Yeah, like as the show goes on, we more and more see how
00:26:56 our Morty is like growing ever more cynical and more understanding like how he literally tried
00:27:01 to kill Rick this episode. He did his best to murder Rick. But like, you know, other Mortys are
00:27:06 presented as like significantly more retarded. Yeah, that's true. Even when we were first introduced
00:27:10 to there being more than Morty, it's like ours is supposedly the good Morty, the one that's like
00:27:14 they tell of in legends, you know. True, true. And in this episode, he himself is like, oh,
00:27:21 my lawyer is a fucking Morty. Like, obviously, this is unfair. So like even though our Morty is
00:27:26 still like an idiot in some ways, like he's definitely smarter than he's supposed to be.
00:27:31 He's developed a lot as a person and character. And while it's mostly made him into like a
00:27:35 cynical asshole, he still cares about summer, though, you know, he's he's become cynical
00:27:40 and the way that he tries to pretend that he doesn't care about Rick anymore, specifically
00:27:43 to protect summer show some real maturity and development. And I'm interested to know if we're
00:27:49 going to get like, if Morty is going to become, you know, more of a hero or if he's going to
00:27:56 keep growing as like a, you know, I kind of want to see him get out of this phase he's in of like
00:28:01 really like depressed kind of, you know, like he's really upset with like, like what's going on
00:28:07 with Rick and everything. Like it's kind of breaking him down to see this nihilist. Well,
00:28:11 ending the episode the way Rick chose to is not good for that for healing his mental faculties
00:28:16 at all. I'm just wondering if we'll see Morty evolve more or if he'll if we'll bring back the
00:28:22 evil Morty finally like that's gotta happen. That's the number one thing we all want to see.
00:28:26 Everything else has been brought back. That's right. The show has never like had a promise
00:28:31 that it didn't deliver on right. So that has to appear at some point, you know,
00:28:35 they've got to be these guys are way too smart to not do that. There must have been a plan for it
00:28:39 in the in the cards. Maybe they just haven't figured out how to work it in yet. You know,
00:28:43 the only danger is once that happens, like I'll still love the show. But I'll I always want
00:28:48 something to look forward to, you know, they got to give me something to establish more
00:28:52 shit. Now, you know, there's definitively this feeling of like putting a lot of stuff behind
00:28:57 us and being like, OK, we're tying up all these loose ends so we can introduce new shit. Yeah.
00:29:02 But there's still some loose ends like, you know, Evil Morty and stuff like that. But yeah, tying
00:29:08 up the whole Beth and Jerry thing is I'm so glad. I was just like, oh, thank you. Yeah. I'm glad they
00:29:15 did it like in kind of a glib way where they were like, look, we know you get it already. Like
00:29:19 they've we've already seen like if they made a whole episode about them like finally getting
00:29:23 divorced, it's like we've been boring as shit. Yeah, like we've already seen that character
00:29:27 arc happen. You know what? This this is not do it flip. And the way they did it quickly was
00:29:31 really good because it actually made me like Jerry. This is probably the most I've ever liked
00:29:34 Jerry. He's just like, you know what? This is it. I'm actually taking action in my life. I'm
00:29:39 saying it's me or him right now, which is entirely appropriate to do because Rick is a fucking monster
00:29:44 more or less. And yeah, just really the right way to do it. Yeah. Um, what else happened in this
00:29:51 episode? Why don't we talk a little bit about the sage one sauce? Because that is relevant.
00:29:54 That's important, I think. And the discussion that's gone on around it is is, you know, we did
00:29:59 a little research. I really feel like it's worth talking about. Nate was telling me that, um,
00:30:05 the Shazwan sauce that they bring up in the episode. It's a meme. Yeah. Yeah. I guess there was like a
00:30:10 campaign because they're making they're remaking Mulan. Are they really? That's why it was a
00:30:15 campaign is that there's a Mulan remake. And so people were saying bring back the Shazwan sauce
00:30:19 for the Mulan remake. Wait, I think you're confused because that's what it said on that
00:30:23 article we were reading. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I mean, I know there is a Mulan remake
00:30:28 coming. So like they were saying, Hey, Rick and Morty talked about how great the Shazwan sauce
00:30:32 was for the fucking 90s. Bring it back. It's perfect timing, I guess. Yeah. And then we read
00:30:38 an article about how it wasn't coming back and that there were people who are arguing that it
00:30:42 was a problematic sauce. Yeah. It was a problematic sauce. It was a cultural appropriation of Chinese
00:30:47 culture because of the Shazwan. Okay. First of all, do you people even fucking understand what
00:30:53 America is? America is a place where you bring stuff and you make it appeal to people and they
00:30:59 buy it because they like it. It is inherent to the foundation of the nation that we combine
00:31:04 things. If you think that it is a wrong thing to do, okay, first of all, there's a couple things
00:31:09 we were thinking about might be the actual argument here. If you think that it is wrong
00:31:13 for other cultures to like eat the foods that you invented in your culture, first of all,
00:31:17 you are 100% wrong. I don't respect your opinion. Go away. If your argument is that it is somehow
00:31:23 like it's like evil to misrepresent a culture by like having something like a McDonald's dipping
00:31:29 sauce that is supposed to be like a quote unquote Chinese sauce, but it like isn't spicy enough.
00:31:34 It isn't like real Chinese. I would say I still that is that is fundamentally flawed because
00:31:40 it is on the individual to realize that, okay, this doesn't actually represent China.
00:31:44 This is a fucking sauce that McDonald's is selling to represent like a movie that we're
00:31:49 making in America. It's not fucking China. So what is the actual arguments that there's something
00:31:55 like harmful about this sauce? I do not fundamentally understand this idea of cultural appropriation
00:32:02 being bad in this context. Do you have anything to add to this point, did you?
00:32:08 It's fucking McDonald's. I know.
00:32:12 I because I really hilarious to me. I don't want to fuck around on this issue. I want to
00:32:17 actually address people's real concerns and respond. I like, I mean, this is this is what it
00:32:23 always is. Yeah, it's always it's it's just that it's so unimportant. Yeah, who the fuck cares?
00:32:29 It's like what what Chinese person is like upset that their culture is being besmirched by a
00:32:35 McDonald's dipping sauce. McDonald's itself is an affront to all life and culture as it is.
00:32:41 Yeah, like the entire existence of McDonald's is an evil skirmish. American American like
00:32:46 burger culture is like poorly represented by McDonald's to begin with. So really,
00:32:50 we should be more insulted than anyone. Exactly. Like it's just literally who gives a fuck. Just
00:32:55 give me the fucking Shezwan sauce. It's fucking hilarious. Stop being a fucking show. Jesus Christ.
00:33:02 And you know what? We might be making a mountain out of a molehill here because we only read like
00:33:05 one or two articles. But the fact that there's any discussion like just the fact that I typed in
00:33:11 Shezwan sauce Rick and Morty and the first the first article was sorry, Rick and Morty fans,
00:33:17 but the problematic Shezwan sauce isn't coming back and I immediately burst out laughing when I
00:33:22 read that headline. Fuck you guys. Fuck you guys. I don't give a shit. I don't know how we got onto
00:33:28 that from a Rick and Morty discussion, but it's funny. They made it about that, dude. The people
00:33:33 out there made it about that. Bring it back. And I love that that like, you know, that Rick
00:33:38 went out of his way to do that in his memory because of course that's something he'd care about.
00:33:42 That's that's what I love. They make that kind of like super obscure cultural reference.
00:33:47 I totally get it. Like they make it out like, oh, haha, it's Rick being silly. But I'm like,
00:33:53 nah, man, like I would pretzel pub chicken sandwich from Wendy's. If I had for some reason, I was
00:33:58 going through like memories of 2009. I'm getting a fucking pretzel pub chicken. There's there's like
00:34:04 some mushroom burger at Wendy's every once in a while that I always am on the lookout for and
00:34:08 is gone most of the time. Cheddar and mushroom. Yeah, like mushroom cheddar burger or something.
00:34:13 I want that. That's see, that's my one dipping sauce right after the pretzel pub chicken,
00:34:18 they brought in that sandwich was also great. Yeah. And then they they kept they kept they
00:34:22 had like a revolving door of sandwiches ever diminishing in quality.
00:34:28 Well, the point of it is that's hilarious. And you know, it's a fucking joke. I don't understand
00:34:34 why anyone would even be mad about in the slightest. So let's let's all suck it up. I mean,
00:34:38 if you're gonna be mad about the sauce, just be mad about the Mulan movie in the first place,
00:34:42 which I know, I think they would be, I'm sure they would be, they'd make the same argument that
00:34:45 no, it's watering down our culture. And you know, the thing about that is almost every time one of
00:34:51 those things happens, the actual culture loves it. Yeah, like most of them are like really happy
00:34:57 that their culture is being represented at all. Do actual Chinese people get really mad that
00:35:02 like Mulan exists and is like, Oh, this is a shitty Americanized version of our culture.
00:35:06 Like they got things to do. Yeah, I don't want to speak for them. But I don't think they would
00:35:11 consider it a big fucking deal. I've seen it all the time. Yeah, like Japan, for instance,
00:35:15 where like, they get really excited to even have reference to Japan in an American film, you know.
00:35:23 And they they appropriate Americans and Japanese films are the most fucking
00:35:27 flanderized, like misrepresented. We're literally all blonde cowboys who scream,
00:35:33 fuck and shoot guns. Yeah, every American character in Japan. So like, you know,
00:35:39 oh, but you know, but racism is prejudice plus power. That's the issue. That's the fundamental
00:35:45 disagreements that we have here. Anyway, anything else about this Rick and Morty episode? Well,
00:35:51 there's that little teaser at the end with bird persons back, you know, that's that's a little
00:35:55 something. I don't know how I feel about that. I know what you mean. It's a little bit disappointing.
00:35:58 Kind of liked that bird person was gone. Like I like bringing back Tammy as like an evil. Yeah,
00:36:04 she's alive and relevant. Yeah, like she I mean, she's kind of like an archvillain now. She's kind
00:36:09 of like the big bad. She's she's the one who initiated all of this. Yep. And, you know, I don't
00:36:14 know what she's working for now that the world government's gone. Shit. And can we just reflect
00:36:19 on I believe the first word we ever heard Tammy say was wasn't she said like, Yeah, I love Bukake
00:36:24 really into Bukake. And she is our main villain. Yeah, love it. Love it. And she's great. She's hot.
00:36:31 She fucks. She fucks. She fucks birds. Yeah, it's a little bit. It's a little bit disappointing
00:36:36 that they're kind of going back on that and just reviving him like that. But I mean, he's evil
00:36:40 now. And I mean, they might make it like, I don't know, it kind of reminds me of like when a chef
00:36:46 died in South Park, and they brought him back as like Darth chef, but just for like a second,
00:36:51 you know, I don't know what they're going to do with this Darth bird person. Yeah, yeah,
00:36:59 like we'll say seeing it and especially like just doing it as like a really tired reference to
00:37:05 Star Wars was like, Oh, I don't know, man. Like, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I don't know. He looks kind
00:37:10 of Borg ish too. Yeah. Yeah. Cyborg, dude. I will say hopefully it'll be good. Yeah, I'm not that
00:37:17 worried. These guys are good writers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. There has not been a bad
00:37:22 episode of Rick and Morty. Agreed. There's been a couple. Yeah. Yeah, there were there's a couple
00:37:29 like that night chameleons and raising gizorp is or are probably the two worst episodes. And those
00:37:34 are pretty fun. Agreed. I mean, fucking, I don't know. Chameleons has the the fucking. Yes. Wait,
00:37:42 which one's that again? Yes, the one where Jerry gets trapped in a simulation. Oh, yeah,
00:37:46 recognized that it's a simulation. My man. Just his favorite line. My man. Yeah, like that even
00:37:52 like half of that episode is amazing. Yeah, still the worst episode of the show. It's hard to fault
00:37:57 this hard to fault Rick and Morty. Yep. So yeah, we'll definitely be looking forward to the rest
00:38:01 of season three. No doubt. I got to rewatch season two soon because I still have like the first
00:38:08 three episodes because they were leaked, I watched them like over and over and over again. Yeah. And
00:38:12 the rest of them I watched on TV and never saw again. So like got to get got to get my season
00:38:18 two knowledge up to snuff so I know all the background characters and lore references
00:38:22 where you know that I could look out for when season three gets underway because I'm sure
00:38:27 I'm sure any surviving character we're going to see again. No doubt. That's very much a Dan
00:38:32 Harmon thing. You haven't seen any of community. Have you? I watched all season one. Oh, yeah.
00:38:37 Yeah, I didn't watch beyond that because I got bored. It definitely gets better in season two.
00:38:42 I like season one quite a bit. All right, that's cool. But yeah. I mean, a lot of the arc structure
00:38:49 of Rick and Morty, the meta-ness, all of that is extremely like community. Yeah. Yeah. And obviously
00:38:55 they can do even more on this show because it's fucking you can do literally anything. Yep. And
00:39:00 it's always willing to just... What I love about Rick and Morty is that it's not even that it's
00:39:04 pushing the boundaries, it's that it's just past all of them. Like it represents that we're kind
00:39:08 of in an era where you can literally do anything. Yeah. You can go as violent as you want. You can
00:39:13 say whatever words you want. You can fucking present the most insane concepts you've ever
00:39:18 heard of at the drop of a hat and just keep going. There's no like hand-holding. You know,
00:39:24 and I mean, you could argue that the daily life scenes are like to give retarded audiences like
00:39:30 something to cling to. But even then, I just feel like this show can do literally anything. And
00:39:36 it's like where is the line anymore? Like what's holding it back other than it has to be 22 minutes
00:39:43 long? Yeah. That's like the only real thing. And I really do trust these writers to whatever
00:39:49 they choose to talk about. They will do it in a hilarious, intelligent, and like well-thought-out
00:39:54 way that fits cohesively into the overall structure of the show. So just one of the best fucking shows
