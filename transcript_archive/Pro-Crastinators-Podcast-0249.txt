00:00:00 Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint and
00:00:13 this is Gibbontake.
00:00:17 That's about the, oh god, what's the phrase? That's about the long and short of it. That's
00:00:23 about the, that's true.
00:00:27 That's about a spicy meatball. That's a Moray. That's a me, Mario. That's a me, Mario.
00:00:35 No, sometimes it was just a week goes by and then I'm like, oh, a week went by and nothing
00:00:44 really happened.
00:00:46 Yeah, I feel like we just did the last one. I mean, what did I do this week? This week
00:00:54 I watched GameStop Plummet.
00:00:56 Oh, yeah. What about that? You had some, didn't you?
00:01:01 Yeah. And in fact, I bought a little, I bought some more as it continued to go down. And in
00:01:06 fact, I have an order to buy even more if it goes down further.
00:01:11 Ben, sounds like being stupid is what this means.
00:01:16 No. I mean, it's, I mean, it's so cheap now that like, why not? Right?
00:01:23 I have heard like the narrative of like, this is hurting the billionaires is sort of being
00:01:31 perpetuated, like, in bad faith by people who were who like started the whole thing.
00:01:41 Like they wanted people to buy into it and to put money into it because then they'd be
00:01:46 rich from the stocks that they bought initially.
00:01:50 There's a smaller amount of people who got off.
00:01:53 There was an incentive to like push that, that like the narrative of that further and
00:02:00 further, even if it wasn't necessarily true. I think I've learned like since then that
00:02:06 it's not as clean as, oh, the billionaires all lost money. Lots of other people did make
00:02:13 money.
00:02:14 It's not like I don't think it's not like I don't think that the people doing it had
00:02:19 a vested interest in pushing that angle to encourage people to jump on the bandwagon.
00:02:25 But I don't see how it like wasn't actually Melvin Capital versus retail investors.
00:02:34 Like that is what it was.
00:02:36 Largely, I wish I could remember exactly like the way it was explained to me, but it was,
00:02:46 there was this, what was it, like financial something blog that I read.
00:02:53 I'm stupid. I can't remember it.
00:02:56 I think that's us, honestly. I mean, do I trust?
00:03:02 Well, it was quite well written. Like it acknowledged that the, you know, it's definitely
00:03:09 hurting some people, but like ultimately the people who, you know, the game of chicken
00:03:17 sort of thing, like the last people are more hurt by buying in when it's at the top.
00:03:25 And then I know it's just sort of, I don't know, I feel a little differently about like
00:03:31 how it's because it's gone down now. It's it's less doing anything and people who got
00:03:40 into it at the peak of the hype, maybe just ended up losing a lot of money and not doing
00:03:45 a lot of damage to the billionaires that they were trying to do.
00:03:49 And it sucks for them. That's this is, this is, this is a terrible argument.
00:03:53 This is a terrible argument. Like, yes, obviously, obviously, if you bought at the peak and it's
00:03:59 gone down, you've lost money. No shit. No. This is why I shouldn't have brought it up,
00:04:04 because I can't remember the argument, because it was quite compelling. I was like, I guess, I guess,
00:04:10 yeah, fuck it, whatever. I was just trying to make conversation because I'm on the Procrastinators
00:04:15 podcast. Why would you, why would you try and make conversation with me? Why would you do that?
00:04:21 Why would you try and be on the Procrastinators podcast? I don't know, Ben, maybe it's because
00:04:27 I like you, maybe it's because I like talking to you. Shut up.
00:04:33 Okay. I think there are two ways to look at it. You could say like, oh, okay, the Wall Street
00:04:39 Bets people pushed the narrative that, oh, we're going to stick it to the billionaires.
00:04:43 And it was just a, you know, that was just their angle. But I mean, you could just as easily say,
00:04:48 oh, you know, some financial blog or whatever, or some like some other, some other investor,
00:04:54 who knows what their motives are. I mean, maybe they want to do that because they want to throw
00:04:59 these, you know, the retail investor under the bus. They want to make like a pro-capital argument.
00:05:03 I feel like those two things are like both entirely possible.
00:05:07 I just think that it was sold as a lot more simplistic for like to get people interested in
00:05:16 investing to the detriment of a lot of people who put too much money into it and have lost
00:05:24 quite a lot. There's the thing that was going around like Wall Street Bets have been like
00:05:30 suppressing posts that are talking about people like losing all of their money.
00:05:36 It's not Wall Street Bets fault. If somebody bet everything, if somebody invested more than
00:05:42 they were willing to lose and then they lost it. I mean, I don't know. Is there no culpability
00:05:49 at all? Yes. Like even slightly for exaggerating the harm that is being done to the billionaires
00:05:56 and because like none of these, well, not none of them, I guess.
00:06:02 Nobody knew how it was going to shake out. In fact, nobody even really knows how it's
00:06:07 shaken up because it's still an open question whether they've covered their shorts or not.
00:06:11 I think my issue is I'm quite a cautious person. I took my time. I didn't want to jump in straight
00:06:22 away and I kind of waited too long for it for me to even jump in at all. Then it turns out I can't
00:06:27 even do Robin Hood and other things are not as good. So it's like, well, whatever, fuck it.
00:06:32 It's like a fidelity account like me. Yeah, but a lot of people who got into this
00:06:37 obviously, they didn't know how the stock market worked exactly and they were going
00:06:45 off of what other people were telling them and a lot of people went into all of this
00:06:51 quite uninformed as to the repercussions. I don't understand your argument. Yeah,
00:06:57 they shouldn't have done that. I think I just dislike hype a lot in general and this is one
00:07:02 of those instances where maybe the hype caused more damage than was necessary.
00:07:08 Speaking as someone who literally lost money because of the hype, it's my fault. It's my fucking
00:07:14 problem. Yeah, I just feel like there's trying to be like, it's difficult to say, oh, morally you
00:07:28 should, I don't know, put a warning. I don't know what the solution would be.
00:07:34 It just sucks that if not all the information is given and there's hype, people are going to
00:07:40 do things emotionally and I don't know. I don't know enough to make a really strong argument here,
00:07:50 but I'm just saying. I just think people are responsible for themselves.
00:07:58 Who's fault? I mean, this was not like, there was that one guy, a deep fucking value, but
00:08:07 he wasn't the one running the whole hype machine. He was kind of behind the whole plan,
00:08:13 but it's not like he was out there. None of them knew that it was going to blow up like that.
00:08:17 Yeah, that's true. It's not like I'm trying to blame somebody for other people losing money.
00:08:21 That's not the way I'm thinking about it. Here's my issue. Let's assume that as an
00:08:27 actually the shorts have been covered, like the whole thing is done, it is down and it is
00:08:32 going to stay down and continue to go down. There is no more gasoline left in the GME machine.
00:08:40 It is a lost cause. It was a failed attempt and it didn't work. It spiked for a minute and that's
00:08:45 it. I mean, that could be the case. It's pretty likely, it's fairly likely the case, but nobody
00:08:53 knew how it was going to shake out. It was not known that that would be the result.
00:08:59 So it can be true, both things can be true, that the stick it to the billionaire sentiment
00:09:07 was sincerely meant and that did not occur. I know, I absolutely believe that it was
00:09:12 sincerely meant at first or at least majority of people were like, I'm not saying the narrative
00:09:18 is completely false. I'm just saying that there was an invested interest in certain people who
00:09:23 got into it early to keep the narrative going. And I was saying like the on Wall Street bets,
00:09:30 the Reddit thread, people's posts about how they got into it because of the hype and they've lost
00:09:37 their life savings. Stupid, obviously they're at fault for that. But those posts were being like
00:09:42 suppressed to give the impression that it was a lot more successful for everyone than it was.
00:09:47 When you say suppressed, when you say suppressed, I mean, I mean, the like the front page of
00:09:53 Wall Street bets was covered in people like, and it was the same thing on like on like the
00:09:58 when I was in Bitcoin, I would sometimes look at the Bitcoin subreddit, and it was the same thing
00:10:02 then it like the front pages is covered in posts that are super fucking bullish that are all like
00:10:08 this shit's going to the moon, the shit's gonna go as high as this is gonna go infinitely high,
00:10:11 we're all gonna make a million dollars because that's what people want to see. And that's what
00:10:14 gets upvoted. And that's what, you know, that's what ends up getting most visibility. That's
00:10:18 just how red it works. I guess, sure, I heard that people's posts were being deleted, not that
00:10:26 they were just not getting upvotes. But I, I haven't looked into it myself. I just heard that it was
00:10:33 on a Wall stream. Well, here's okay. Okay. Aside from the the GME thing, right? That's that's the
00:10:44 thing. I'm very annoyed. I'm very annoyed about Dogecoin. I don't like it. Yeah, I don't know
00:10:52 what's been going on with that. Exactly. Well, basically, while the GME thing was going on,
00:10:58 I don't know if it was all Elon, but like Elon was in part of it. And every time Elon tweets
00:11:03 about anything, like, the market does weird shit. So Elon et al, while the GME thing was going on,
00:11:12 he was like, Oh, dogecoin to the moon. And then it did. And it's like, it went up pretty high. And
00:11:19 I like saw it shooting up. And I tried to get a Robinhood account to get some. And they didn't
00:11:26 approve. They only approved me like, like two days ago, like my and I don't need I don't even know
00:11:30 if I want to use it anymore. And I don't know, I thought it was just going to spike momentarily,
00:11:36 but like, it's still going up, it's it's gone up even more today, it's almost back up to like
00:11:40 where it peaked at the time. So like, it's still rising. And that's fine. That's fine and everything.
00:11:48 But I'm it really pisses me off that like the GME thing was like, okay, we can be skeptical of a
00:11:55 one, but supposedly it was like about something. It was like, Oh, let's like, you know, little guy
00:12:01 beat the hedge fund managers, it was about something. And then Elon et al, just make just do like,
00:12:06 hey, guys, look at this other thing, haha, funny dogecoin meme currency, crypto of the people.
00:12:13 And like, that's fine. It's fine that people made money on that. But it's really, I think it's
00:12:20 really despicable of Elon to like, do that at that moment, like what, why did the why what was
00:12:26 the need for it? It didn't even have anything to do with it. It's just like, at a moment,
00:12:30 people were thinking about stocks, he was like, Hey, look at this other stock.
00:12:33 And it worked. I mean, yeah, people love Elon, but like, what's despicable about mentioning it,
00:12:44 even knowing that it would like spike dogecoin? Well, I don't know. I mean, for one thing,
00:12:50 maybe people who might have been considering the GME thing might have been diverted to doge.
00:12:56 Right. Okay. I mean, the fervor was about GME and AMC and Nokia and all that.
00:13:01 And dogecoin didn't have anything to do with it. But I don't know,
00:13:05 because it's funny and because it's Elon. I mean, it's, there's a lot of reddit energy
00:13:10 in the entire thing. It's, it's just sort of like, haha, like, I don't know anything about this stuff.
00:13:17 But it's like, what everyone else is doing. Oh, cool. Elon's also tweeting about this other
00:13:21 thing that's also money related. Haha, that's really funny doge. Very currency much. Wow.
00:13:27 Yes, I know. That's, that's what I said, and it makes me really mad. Yeah, I mean, I suppose.
00:13:35 I don't know. I mean, it's not, it's not just sour grapes, because like, I'm fine. I'm fine with
00:13:42 the fact. Okay, on the one hand, on the one hand, like, I, yeah, I do, it's not, it's not about the
00:13:48 fact that like people made money. It's about the fact that Elon got his way. That's what makes me mad.
00:13:53 Yeah. Also, yeah, if you, if Elon owns dogecoin, this is like, wait, does he?
00:14:01 I don't, I don't know. I mean, he might or he might or he might not.
00:14:05 I thought I've heard that it was made by some of, I guess, whoever made it doesn't necessarily have
00:14:10 most of it. Not necessarily. Um, that's the thing that like, fucking, that McAfee, I saw
00:14:16 like a little YouTube documentary about John McAfee, and apparently he would do a thing where he
00:14:21 would invest in crypto and then he would do like a public circuit, appearance circuit, talking about
00:14:26 the crypto, pump up its value by getting it exposure, and then just sell it, right? So I don't
00:14:33 know if Elon's doing that, but like, if he owns, if he owns dogecoin, or anything that he tweets
00:14:40 about. It probably, I mean, like if he sees like, oh, all of these Reddit bros are getting interested
00:14:48 in stocks and shares and investing, maybe if I get some dogecoin, I can get them to pivot over
00:14:56 to investing in the thing that makes me more money. Maybe. It would, it would be uncharacteristically
00:15:04 intelligent for Elon Musk. So I don't know. I mean, he knows how to make money.
00:15:10 Uh, and I'm sure he, he understands, I'm sure he understands like what his, what his tweets
00:15:17 tend to do to the market. Like that time that he tweeted that like his, the Tesla stock was too high,
00:15:23 and then it went down. I just hate him. I just really hate him. And I am upset that he, that's
00:15:34 something that he likes happened. That's pretty much the long and short of it.
00:15:41 Preach. Yeah. I feel like that, like generally speaking, all of this stuff is just made,
00:15:51 like the major good, I think, is just letting a lot of people understand how fucking fake everything
00:15:58 is in terms of like finances. A lot of people become disillusioned to it. And that's,
00:16:06 you know, good because it's true. And now they know, but yeah, there's not much that can be done
00:16:11 about it immediately. But I think, I mean, yeah, I think, I mean, everyone already knew.
00:16:18 Well, I don't think everyone knew quite to the extent because everyone's just heard of stocks.
00:16:23 And they don't really, like the layman, the layman doesn't know quite how like
00:16:30 manipulative stock people are. They just assume, well, they're just doing things. I don't know.
00:16:36 They make money by, like they have no idea that it's all based on, I don't know,
00:16:44 deliberately fucking with real people. It is a good example of like the economy being
00:16:52 imaginary. I mean, I don't think it's gonna, I mean, I don't think it's gonna have like
00:17:00 convinced that many people that like didn't already have that opinion, you know.
00:17:05 I guess not. Well, I guess that's the case of like everything. I guess it's all just like
00:17:09 death by a thousand cuts, you know, like in terms of like showing like people understanding that
00:17:14 like, oh, the system is rigged. I mean, I think you're right. And that a lot of people know that
00:17:20 things are rigged and, and like, it's not fair. And there's like a class of people at the top
00:17:25 that are too powerful. And it sucks. There's just different difference in opinion of like,
00:17:34 why, whether that's a problem. And if there is someone at the top, who is it? And what should
00:17:40 we do about it? Some people would think it's the Jews that are at the top, which is dumb.
00:17:46 Laws, right? That's good. Yeah. And then other people would think that it's not a problem
00:17:51 because they want to be at the top. Yeah. So it's like, yeah. Man, the mindset of like,
00:18:02 the mindset of like, imagine believing that like, whoever is at the top, like,
00:18:11 obviously deserves to be there because they are there. And if they didn't deserve to be there,
00:18:18 they wouldn't be there. They must have, they must have earned it somehow, right? Like,
00:18:22 like, like things must be fair. Like the world must be a fair place where merit is rewarded.
00:18:28 Therefore, whoever is at the top must deserve it and must also be the best person in addition to
00:18:35 being the most successful because how because it would just be fucked up if it were any other way.
00:18:41 So yeah, it can't be. Well, feel a lot of that, feel a lot of that attitude.
00:18:49 When I go to fucking Twitter, and I see these fucking liberals replying to Brooklyn dad Defiant,
00:18:56 that filthy weenie piece of shit about that lady smashing her guitar and saying it's racist that
00:19:06 she did that. Yeah, what the hell was that? I didn't catch all of it. I only recently. I don't
00:19:12 know. I don't know. It was, I guess, I guess some band performed on SNL and like the woman
00:19:19 guitarist smashed her guitar and Brooklyn dad Defiant is like, um, what's up with that?
00:19:26 And all these filthy, these filthy goblins in the reply is like, um, a real display
00:19:34 of unwarranted white privilege. Oh, do you know that starving Africans would love to eat that
00:19:39 guitar? And just, just as opposed to warranted white privilege as opposed to warranted white
00:19:47 privilege, um, I don't know, just like a, just like a bunch of liberal hand rigging over shit that
00:19:52 doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Literally just like rock, literally just like rock and roll
00:19:56 is dangerous and gonna end up corrupt our kids like so uncouth. I don't know how these people
00:20:01 take them so seriously. Like in a in an abstract sort of way, you could say, oh, she has the money
00:20:10 to smash guitar because she knows she can buy another one. But like that's so like irrelevant
00:20:15 to everything. Okay. Okay. The thing, the thing about that, the thing about that is how, how
00:20:19 fucking dog brain we do you have to be to like, okay, there's the guitar that she's smashing
00:20:26 couple hundred dollars versus like this woman is appearing on SNL, right? Like that is like,
00:20:33 oh, this woman who's appearing on SNL, you know, that's fine. But like smashing a guitar is just
00:20:40 an unwarranted display of privilege. Are you fucking kidding me? Like that's like the guitar is
00:20:45 nothing. Right. If you're trying to like criticize power should be like, oh, this is like the, you
00:20:51 know, here's here's a person who's getting this like huge, this huge platform to like promote
00:20:58 themselves, you know, this is this is like, this is a huge, a huge opportunity that represents
00:21:03 like a massive, you know, potential future earnings for this person. It's so much more than the guitar,
00:21:08 right? The guitar is like, is like a, a mode of dust in the, in the, in the avalanche of what this
00:21:16 event that you are witnessing is. It could be that being, being on SNL means that she has the
00:21:23 money potential to smash that guitar, whereas before she didn't. And it's like, I mean, I,
00:21:27 I mean, I would, I mean, I would think it was stupid and dumb to be like, um, no one should be
00:21:32 on SNL because that means they have too much privilege. Like, I, like, I would think that's
00:21:36 stupid too, but at least you would be like, you know, you wouldn't be missing the forest
00:21:40 for the trees quite so much, right? If you want to hyper focus on something stupid.
00:21:45 Surface level, woke brigade stuff. Yeah. Right. Right.
00:21:52 That's what that's what was making me mad today.
00:21:58 Did you see, did you see Chris Chan tweeting the, the slime coin and the pins?
00:22:03 That's so fucking cool. So fucking cool. She's got the red man pin and the red man pin.
00:22:10 She's got it all. And, uh, and then a predict, predictably a bunch of like, a bunch of like,
00:22:17 very obviously mentally ill people, just like swarming in the replies to be like, um, Chris is
00:22:24 bad. Um, Chris, you are. Yeah, I got one of those. I muted the conversation. Posting an ugly picture
00:22:30 of you, posting an ugly picture of you, like screaming at a web camera to, to own you, followed
00:22:36 by, followed by a gift, a funny gift of a dog going, what? To make you look foolish. Haha.
00:22:44 I, I don't get it. I mean, I guess I understand, um, like if you're so like frothing at the
00:22:51 mouth, like raging that you would do that to every tweet they post. It just sort of,
00:22:58 it's the same people. It's got nothing to do with anything. It's just, it's the same people.
00:23:02 Christian is, is showing that she got a box with stuff in it. Look at this. Oh yeah. Well,
00:23:09 you're Chris Chan. So. Oh yeah. Well, look at this, like ugly drawing someone did of you, stupid.
00:23:16 It's, it's the same people too. Like I've seen some of these like accounts. I mean,
00:23:22 some of these accounts are just explicitly called like, you know, Son of Choo fucker 666 or whatever.
00:23:27 So like this is a dedicated account for this purpose. And others just seem to be like, others
00:23:32 just seem to be like, otherwise kind of normal looking people, but who like just are following
00:23:39 Chris just to do this stuff. And it's people with like, it's people with like six followers who,
00:23:45 I don't know, other than that, like they just like, I don't know, retweet like announcements
00:23:50 about Marvel movies or whatever. It's like, like a crossed arm reaction channels, you know,
00:23:58 those, those sort of things where they're just, it's got that sort of vibe to it where it's like
00:24:04 they're, they're very angry and very insistent on things that are really unimportant all the time.
00:24:10 And they all tend to have their arms crossed with their angry furry avatars, nothing against
00:24:16 furries, but it is funny. Okay, there is one, there is one person though. Okay, there, there are
00:24:25 a few people who are the same, except instead of posting like, I hate you, they post like,
00:24:31 looks nice Chris or whatever. And these are some of these people also have like, Son of Choo and
00:24:36 Rose. These are like, young or young or like, either young or mentally handicapped artists
00:24:44 who draw, you know, Son of Choo fan art, and they, you know, they have their own little click in this,
00:24:52 in this weird. I would tend to assume it's more that they're, they're like mentally handicapped,
00:24:57 because I don't know if Son of Choo is like a hot thing that the kids are into at all.
00:25:02 Well, no, but I mean, there could be some. If there's, if there's any kids around, it's the
00:25:07 people making the, the, I hate you, Chris Chan accounts, the 14 year olds who like go to cringe
00:25:13 compilations. That's probably true. But, but there's this one person who honestly, like,
00:25:22 gives me a very uncomfortable vibe. And it's not for any reason you might think this person,
00:25:29 this, this girl, she, she replies to things. And everything she says is a reply that's like,
00:25:41 do your best. It might not be much, but I know you're doing the best you can.
00:25:47 Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart. And like all her posts on Twitter are like
00:25:53 comics that she's drew, she's drawn, she's not very good at drawing, but whatever,
00:25:56 she'll post like a page of her comic and be like, I know it's not much, but I'm doing the best I can.
00:26:02 And it's so creepy. I do not like it at all.
00:26:08 But they're doing the best they can, Ben.
00:26:10 I don't know what's going on there. It was like, no, she, she posted this
00:26:15 in response, like I posted the crystal, the crystal Chris sent me and she replies,
00:26:19 it's not much, but I know whatever it is, I'm sure it's wonderful. And then a bunch of like
00:26:24 heart, gift boxes, emojis. I, what's the, what, why say it's not, I don't know, doesn't look like
00:26:30 much. I don't know. I know that I'm, I know that I am like seeing mental illness here and I probably
00:26:36 like should just, I don't know. I probably shouldn't worry about it, but it's, it's, it's
00:26:42 sad. Like it's, it's like, it's stressing me. It's distressing me. This person seems to be in a,
00:26:48 in a bad way. This is like their mode of operation. And I'm strained optimism at all times.
00:26:54 I mean, she sounds, I mean, all of her tweets sound like she's trying to make the best of a
00:26:59 situ, of a situation that she is on the verge of tears over. And that's regardless of like,
00:27:05 whether it's like she's, she made something and wants people to see it, or just other people
00:27:09 are having a completely unrelated conversation. Oh boy. I mean, it could be sad. It could just
00:27:16 be learned behavior from hearing, like if it's a, if it's a mental thing, like an autism thing.
00:27:24 There's a lot of, when you're talking to someone, I don't know, I don't know, like specific scientific
00:27:32 like things of, of this is this mental illnesses. This is that one. But sometimes like you'll hear
00:27:39 them repeat phrases that the parents have obviously said to them and things they've heard on TV.
00:27:46 And, and so little of like their actual thoughts on things. Oh yeah. Gotta make the best of the
00:27:53 situation. I may be that a parent who was upset that they were handicapped and they
00:27:58 tried to make the best of the situation where it's like, I don't know, I could see that happening.
00:28:03 Yeah. Yeah, I guess I could see that. Sometimes I, there are some, some tweets I see and some
00:28:11 like accounts that I see tweeting over and over again, give me a vibe that is like weird in some way.
00:28:17 And I'm like, sometimes I get a little like weirded out and like kind of fucked up about it, like,
00:28:21 God, this person, this person seems like really fucked up. This person is like, kind of scarier,
00:28:27 like it's depressing to contemplate what this person is like. But like, I don't know, a lot of
00:28:31 the time, I don't remember like how many times have I like known someone online who's weird and
00:28:35 then I meet them in person and like they're not as like bizarre as they seem on the internet.
00:28:42 I try to tell myself like probably most of the time that's, that's what, that's the case. Disabled
00:28:47 people are not that strange unless they're like an extreme case. Like you can, you can hold a
00:28:53 conversation with them. They may not have like much like interesting things to say, but like
00:28:58 it's, they're generally normal. They just have like weird fascinations with specific things.
00:29:04 Yeah. Yeah. And, and repeat phrases that they've heard rather than learning how to, I don't know,
00:29:11 come up with a run. You know what? Like honestly, the, like the, the fact that this, this account is
00:29:16 like so, it's so consistent, which makes me think maybe you're right. Maybe they just, they learned
00:29:22 this, this, this behavior or this, these phrases and I'll just kind of like, I'll just say that.
00:29:28 Yeah. That makes sense. I don't know. It's a whole, it's a whole, it's a whole milieu. It's a whole,
00:29:38 like, it's a whole cadre of people that just start around to respond in whatever preset way
00:29:46 they have decided on doing whenever Chris says anything. Oh, yeah. Oh, never,
00:29:53 whenever Chris says anything. No, no, I'm just thinking about disabled people in general.
00:29:57 Oh, okay. They feel to me, because I've, I've worked like, like volunteered. I've told that before,
00:30:03 like volunteer work for helping disabled people in like summer camp stuff. And they seem so much
00:30:13 easier to just be around because they're so lacking in judgment. They're like a normal person.
00:30:20 That makes them easier to be around? Well, huh? That makes them easier to be around?
00:30:25 Yeah. Cause they're just, I don't know, like for lack of a better term, I can think of,
00:30:29 they're simpler. They, they have what they like and they don't assume a lot because they find it
00:30:36 difficult to understand a lot of things. Obviously, things will set them set them off, make them
00:30:44 upset, like they have emotions and stuff. But like, if you're, you know, amenable to them and
00:30:51 it's, you're not like doing anything that annoys them. They're just, they're a lot less, I don't
00:30:58 know, I feel less at ease when I'm among teenage normal people, like non-disabled teenagers than
00:31:06 I am disabled people. Well, yeah. Cause who knows what like regular teenagers are scheming?
00:31:12 Like who knows what they're plotting behind your back? They're laughing at you. They're laughing at
00:31:18 you when you're not, when you're not looking. They're laughing at me because I don't know something.
00:31:24 But when it's disabled people, you're laughing at them behind their back. So it's much, much more
00:31:29 comfortable. No, it's not true. It's true. I know. I walk to, I see a disabled person,
00:31:38 I chuckle to myself, but I know they won't mind because they didn't hear it. I go,
00:31:43 you go, what a, what a rube. And then they show me their Thomas the Tank engine
00:31:50 sticker book and I'm like, oh yeah, cool. Nice. You got, oh yeah, cool, but on the inside you're
00:31:56 like loser. Who the fuck has stickers these days? Chris told me that I should make decal sheets
00:32:08 of the pin designs. That's the thing where like you, that's the thing where like it's on like the
00:32:13 back of plastic and like you rub it onto something, right? I've heard of decals for like cars. I assume
00:32:20 yeah, you could do that on phones and other things. Yeah, I'm not sure what that is. Yeah,
00:32:26 it's like a sticker, but it's like, it's like a sticker, but instead of like sticking the material
00:32:32 onto it, it has like the image is like on the back of the plastic and you put the plastic on a thing
00:32:38 and you like scrape the front and it like transfers the image directly onto the thing, right? So it's
00:32:46 like a permanent sticker with no like plastic layer that it's printed on, which I mean, I could do
00:32:52 that, I guess. I could do that, I guess. Oh, the profit margins wouldn't be there. It's all about
00:32:58 that profit margin. The thing I would equate it to, by the way, is not like, they have less of a
00:33:06 judgmental side mostly because their mental faculties are like kind of young compared to the
00:33:14 physical age of their body. So they'll have like, you know, a brain of a 10 year old or whatever.
00:33:20 And children, you don't laugh at them for being into whatever. I do. Well, yeah, sure. Stomping
00:33:29 on kids all day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kick them when they're down and they're always down because
00:33:36 they're short. Yeah, but it's just like working with kids that they're very like simple and easy
00:33:41 to understand and they don't judge you too much. Anyone too old is like, ah, this is like, there
00:33:46 could be drama with this person if they might have ideas that I disagree with. Ah, fuck. Why can't
00:33:53 people just be into weird things? They might be a Pete Buttigieg supporter. If somebody has
00:34:00 that Pete Buttigieg sticker book, I'm not going to. Hey, watch this. Look at my Pete Buttigieg
00:34:09 doodles. It's like, no, I'm not going to. That's not cute. That's not nice.
00:34:15 Did you see that? Did you see that drawing of Ronald Reagan? The one that like, it was like a
00:34:22 Congresswoman did, right? Like a 30 something Congresswoman did like a child's fucking like
00:34:28 pencil sketch of Ronald Reagan and she has it hanging in her office. Yeah. What is it with
00:34:34 Congresswoman these days? I don't get it. What's going on? Well, I mean, I'll tell you is that the
00:34:42 GOP doesn't have any standards. The GOP will just elect any fucking person who it says that they,
00:34:50 I don't know, will continue austerity politics. I can't, I mean, I didn't pay attention to the
00:34:58 politicians and senators and whatever or MPs. I didn't pay attention to all that when I was
00:35:05 young. So I maybe people this insane have been being voted in for decades and I never noticed,
00:35:12 but now that I'm more like, like, like, it's just so bizarre to think someone could be that
00:35:19 brazenly stupid and then get elected. I mean, most people don't pay that much attention to like,
00:35:28 you know, they're like district representatives. Sure. Yeah. Like that's below a lot of people's
00:35:35 radar. So like in some counties, you can get elected for that kind of thing with like relatively
00:35:41 fewer votes than you might think. And nevertheless, you fucking work in the Capitol building after
00:35:47 that because I don't know. Yeah. Not to say that a badly drawn picture of Ronald Reagan is stupid,
00:35:54 it's just very cringe. I don't know why you would be proud of that drawing. I mean, it,
00:35:59 I mean, it is stupid. I mean, because it's, I mean, it's, I mean, imagine you're an adult,
00:36:04 you're an adult and you're like, look, I drew this. First of all, it's terrible. Some people cannot see
00:36:10 their inability to do artistic things. I don't know whether that's necessarily a sign of lack of
00:36:17 intelligence. Maybe it is. It is. Of course it is. Well, I don't know. I don't know whether I sound
00:36:22 good when I'm singing. When you, when you, when you, okay. I mean, it's cringe because it's a bad
00:36:29 drawing and she like didn't recognize that too. It's, it's bad to like, look, I, I, it's just a
00:36:36 bad thing that like I do, I like this, this politician so much that I like drew them and I
00:36:41 hung it in my office. Like that is quite childish. Like, no, like that would be true even if it was
00:36:45 a good drawing. And the third and most importantly, it's Ronald Reagan and Ronald Reagan is a, is a
00:36:50 fucking a dogfucker who is in hell. So nobody should, nobody should like him.
00:36:56 Dude. So that's, it's a three pronged cringe attack.
00:36:59 Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump.
00:37:05 You need I say more?
00:37:07 No, please don't.
00:37:10 Uh, um.
00:37:13 There are new candidate, John Old Jefferson.
00:37:18 John Old, John Old MacDonald.
00:37:20 John Old Tron.
00:37:26 John Old Tron 2024.
00:37:30 How, how long is it going to be until a streamer is like running for office
00:37:35 or a video maker, a content creator? Because there's a lot of them now.
00:37:40 Oh, I mean, I, I, well, I guess, I mean, no, the Sargon,
00:37:43 Akata, when he fucking became the, did he, no, he ran for MP.
00:37:50 I think he ran for MP. I don't think he became one.
00:37:54 Let me check. I don't know. I honestly don't ever think I found out.
00:38:00 All right, let's find out.
00:38:01 Yeah.
00:38:04 Carl Benjamin is a British anti-feminist YouTuber.
00:38:07 A former member of the year. Yeah. So he's a member.
00:38:11 What way? I guess I don't know what member of the party means.
00:38:16 Member of the party doesn't mean much of anything.
00:38:19 He was one of his unsuccessful candidates for Southwest England constituency.
00:38:23 Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:38:26 Um, so basically it hasn't happened yet. What a fucking bitch.
00:38:32 Yeah. Well, well, I mean, you said run and like he did run.
00:38:37 I mean, be elected. That's what I meant.
00:38:39 Oh, could you imagine like, I don't know, destiny running and then getting elected?
00:38:47 Yeah, imagine that on a podium. It'd be pretty funny.
00:38:51 I don't think, I don't think destiny would though.
00:38:54 I think that I think that would be more work for less reward than what destiny does now.
00:39:00 So I don't think he would do it.
00:39:01 True, but he might be like swayed by the potential political power that could enact more change.
00:39:09 He would run, he would run as a spoiler to AOC when she runs in next in 2024.
00:39:16 He runs just for that. And then accidentally wins.
00:39:21 Um, maybe. Oh my God. Oh, this is so good.
00:39:26 This is so good. The first, the intro, the intro of Sargon's Wikipedia page
00:39:32 includes the thing that he said I wouldn't even rape you.
00:39:37 What a fucking jackass. What a fucking joke. I fucking hate this guy more than,
00:39:44 he's like in my top five. He's like in my top five, like people I hate the most.
00:39:49 Oh my God, he's 41, 42, he says.
00:39:54 How old do you think he was?
00:39:55 I don't know. I guess I thought he was in his 30s, a little younger than that.
00:40:00 Nah, nah, he's an old, he's an old fuck. He's a relic.
00:40:05 And when I'm 41, I too will be a relic and I hope someone will throw me in the fucking gutter
00:40:10 and forget about me.
00:40:11 Um, oh man. Oh man.
00:40:17 Um, damn, I'm going to be old soon.
00:40:21 Soon, haha.
00:40:23 And then, and then what? Can I, I mean, I don't know.
00:40:27 I don't know.
00:40:27 Then you can buy a cane and you can actually use it and it'll be like a cool thing to have.
00:40:34 I don't even know.
00:40:35 You can get like a cane with a podron at the end.
00:40:38 I don't even know like what I want to do with myself like this year.
00:40:42 So I don't, I definitely don't know what I want to do when I'm like 40.
00:40:47 Like, I don't know, I know I want to finish that thing I've been working on.
00:40:51 And I guess I want to finish a bunch of the comics that I left unfinished.
00:40:55 And then I, I don't know.
00:40:59 I don't know. I've been, I've been, I've been like, I've been thinking like, I don't know.
00:41:03 Maybe this, uh, maybe this whole comics, maybe this whole art thing is like just not
00:41:09 doing it for me.
00:41:10 Maybe I've just like, maybe I should consider myself a failure at this point,
00:41:13 having like been doing it for this many years and having only produced as much as I have.
00:41:19 You know?
00:41:20 Uh, sure. Yes.
00:41:22 I'm fatically agreed.
00:41:23 I thought so.
00:41:24 Me too. Good. Okay, cool.
00:41:27 I mean, there's, there's no such thing as like starting too late.
00:41:32 So like, that's, that's, that's not what I mean.
00:41:35 That's not really what I mean.
00:41:36 Like if, if you had never done comics before and then you started at 40, you could still get somewhere.
00:41:43 Yeah.
00:41:43 The fact that you've done anything before this point means that you're a leg up on anyone who
00:41:47 does start at 40.
00:41:49 I, I, I, that's not what I mean.
00:41:51 What I, what I mean is not that like, oh, it's too late. I haven't made it yet. I'll never make it.
00:41:56 It's that like, I, I've been doing it for a while.
00:42:00 And I have, you know, only accomplished this much.
00:42:05 Should I have been doing something else?
00:42:09 Like, should I start doing something?
00:42:10 Well, that's the, oh, I have no, I have no fucking idea.
00:42:13 I have abs, I have absolutely no other idea for what to be doing.
00:42:18 I mean, like, I guess at that point you're getting into it.
00:42:23 Like, what is the meaning of existence sort of talk?
00:42:26 Like if, if you're not exactly,
00:42:29 you want to live because that seems like it works so far.
00:42:34 And then beyond that, I don't know.
00:42:38 You need money to live, so you need to do something.
00:42:41 So you can pay.
00:42:43 But aside from that, I don't know, like nobody really knows.
00:42:46 And it's hard to like put a, put a real hard label on what you need to do.
00:42:53 I guess I just see, I guess I just see,
00:42:58 I see fucking like artists on Twitter or whatever who are like, oh, you know,
00:43:05 I, I'm, I'm, uh, I have too many ideas and I can't draw them all.
00:43:09 Like I'm over, like there's so many things I want to do.
00:43:12 There's so many like, you know, story ideas in my head that like I have to get down
00:43:16 and there's not enough time in the day.
00:43:18 And like, I'm not like that.
00:43:19 I, I'm not overflowing with like ideas.
00:43:22 I have like one idea.
00:43:24 I have like one thing that I want to work on right now.
00:43:27 I have a bunch of old ideas that I never completed that I could finish if I want.
00:43:30 I'm not, I'm not bursting with like, oh, I know, I know, you know,
00:43:35 all these things I want to do.
00:43:36 I don't know if anything is even worth doing.
00:43:41 So, so I am like, am I doing something wrong?
00:43:45 They seem to have a clue that I don't have.
00:43:48 I mean, surely you had a moment before where you were like,
00:43:53 I want to do this comic and that comic or even earlier than that in your life.
00:43:58 Like everybody has moments of like passion and they,
00:44:03 they feel like they need to exist so that they can do something specific.
00:44:07 And at the moment you just are not feeling it in, in, in the way that maybe you used to.
00:44:14 Yeah.
00:44:16 Yeah, I'm, I'm not, I'm not.
00:44:18 Not feeling it lately.
00:44:21 Maybe that's, maybe that's to be expected.
00:44:23 I don't know.
00:44:28 I mean, I mean, I'm like, I'm like, I'm, I'm feeling the thing that I have,
00:44:32 like, you know, that I'm working on right now.
00:44:35 And then, but aside from that, I'm like, even it's, it's hard to like even,
00:44:43 even that I'm starting to get frustrated with because it's taken longer than I wanted it to.
00:44:47 Which is just like construction.
00:44:49 Yes, which like, of course it did.
00:44:51 Everything, everything always does.
00:44:52 It's just another, it's just another thing that
00:44:57 it's like, oh, it was supposed to be done by now.
00:44:59 It's, it's, it's supposed to be done by now.
00:45:00 Just like all that other stuff that I never finished.
00:45:02 Well, hang on.
00:45:04 If it's supposed to be done, like it's taking a while, but you also feel like,
00:45:08 wow, when everything's done, what am I going to do?
00:45:10 Gee, nothing, I guess.
00:45:12 Like the, the, the, the feel like conflicting thoughts.
00:45:16 Like you feel like you don't have enough, you're, you're wasting time,
00:45:19 but the time you, you, you have left, you feel like you would waste anyway,
00:45:24 or like you, you don't know what to fill it with.
00:45:28 Yes.
00:45:31 So what, what the fuck?
00:45:34 I don't know.
00:45:35 I mean, I guess, like, it's easy to like,
00:45:41 to know that something could have been done quicker
00:45:43 if you had been working harder.
00:45:46 I don't know.
00:45:48 Would, would you feel like it would be, you would be more into it?
00:45:52 Had you already been working harder and therefore more have, of it had been created?
00:46:00 Yeah.
00:46:00 If, if I, if I was where I expected to be with it now, which is like done or almost done,
00:46:07 like if I was almost done with it right now, I would be like, fuck yeah, this shit is like,
00:46:12 we just got to, we just got to put the finishing touches on this and then it's go time.
00:46:16 Like I would be excited about like, you know, putting it out soon.
00:46:20 At the moment, it's like maybe, maybe a little less than half.
00:46:24 And I'm like, oh, I still have that much left to do with it.
00:46:28 And I'm like afraid.
00:46:29 I'm like trepidatious that like, will I, like, I'm like, oh God,
00:46:34 am I, am I not going to finish this too?
00:46:36 I mean, I am going to do it.
00:46:37 I have to.
00:46:38 I'm not going to like do anything else until it's done.
00:46:42 But it feels like, I don't know, you ever, you know, when you start a new thing,
00:46:49 when you start a new project and you feel like that sense of like,
00:46:53 I don't know if I can do this.
00:46:56 Yeah, I've had that recently.
00:46:59 And I know from experience that like, if you just keep going, you can always do it.
00:47:10 Even if it ends up being a little different than you thought it would look, right?
00:47:16 If you are flexible and, you know, if you just keep, if you just keep trying,
00:47:23 if you just keep chipping away at it, it will eventually be done.
00:47:26 You can, you can do anything you put your mind to.
00:47:29 It's true.
00:47:32 So like, but I still, I'm, but I'm, so like in my mind,
00:47:38 I know that I can do it, but in my heart, I am deeply, I am feeling very strongly
00:47:45 that irrational feeling of perhaps I can't do it.
00:47:51 Right, sure.
00:47:52 I feel like that quite a lot with a lot of my work where it's like, I drew the Clarissa
00:48:00 comic and I'm like, I look at it and it's like, I know that if I was, maybe it took a little
00:48:07 longer on it or I worked, I did work very hard, but it was like a, like a quite a
00:48:15 sharp deadline.
00:48:16 Like it was only a month I could do all that work in.
00:48:19 If I had done it a little slower, it would have been better and I know I can draw better
00:48:24 and I know I can improve and it's all of this like potential.
00:48:29 But like, I envision that and then I see that the work I've done is not as good as I imagine
00:48:35 I can do and at some point I start to doubt whether my image of potential success even
00:48:44 exists and maybe I was overestimating myself, my abilities.
00:48:48 Maybe I am as, as like shit at things that as people assume.
00:48:55 Absolutely you are, for sure, 100%.
00:48:58 Yeah, like sometimes I, I like, I don't know, there's a few moments.
00:49:06 All that bad stuff I say about you all the time, 100% true, I'm conferred.
00:49:10 It's like, occasionally people will leave a comment on something saying, wow, I had no
00:49:16 idea you could do stuff like this when I said something smart or I made some good drawing.
00:49:23 And it's like,
00:49:24 You said something smart, it's like, wait a minute, you said that?
00:49:27 I didn't realize Gibb was smart, I didn't realize Gibb could draw, I didn't realize Gibb could
00:49:30 animate, it's like, I knew I could, but I just never did it yet.
00:49:34 And it, it, it frustrates me because I can't, I can't like point to them and say,
00:49:39 you should have known because they could, they couldn't have known.
00:49:41 Well, that, well, that just means they, they hadn't seen that stuff before.
00:49:45 That means like people are finding your stuff fresh that they hadn't seen before.
00:49:50 No, but like, like everyone, at some point, everyone who's ever seen anything you've ever
00:49:55 done didn't know that you could do that, right?
00:49:56 True, true.
00:49:57 But I guess what it, it makes me feel of is that I give off an air of being low skilled
00:50:03 because the things I do end up showing people are like sketches and rough things.
00:50:08 And I'm like, ah, fuck, I could like spend two hours drawing this better, but whatever,
00:50:14 I'll put it up, I'll put something up.
00:50:16 And then people get an impression of me that I feel is not representative of my skill level.
00:50:21 And it's entirely my doing.
00:50:24 It's just, it sucks because I get, I get impatient and I want to post things before
00:50:29 they're finished.
00:50:30 But look at it the other way around.
00:50:31 Every time someone says, wow, I didn't know Gibb could do this.
00:50:34 That's one more person who no longer has that impression, right?
00:50:38 Yeah, but I shouldn't have built the impression that I was shit at so many things.
00:50:43 Well, I should have, I should have stayed, I should have stayed completely silent and
00:50:47 hidden in, in, in caves under the ground.
00:50:50 And then I should have appeared only when I was already a genius.
00:50:53 But that's like impossible.
00:50:54 It doesn't work like that.
00:50:55 Yeah.
00:50:58 You gotta suffer.
00:51:00 That's just the way it is.
00:51:02 You have to be upset and there, that's all.
00:51:06 Yes.
00:51:07 And I am.
00:51:08 And that means I'm doing, that means I'm going, I'm going to the moon.
00:51:13 I've got the, I've got the, I've got the killer mindset.
00:51:16 The shit mindset that makes me sad.
00:51:18 And that's going to, that's going to carry me to the top.
00:51:22 I need to maximize my tears so I can lubricate my way to success.
00:51:28 Water slides to the, it's a race, it's a race, it's a race to the bottom.
00:51:34 It's a race to the bottom and you gotta, you gotta lubricate your slide down.
00:51:38 It's, it's like, it's like Sonic.
00:51:41 If you, if you get a really fast, if you go down as fast as possible
00:51:44 on the way back up on the other side, you'll be like, zoom in up to the top.
00:51:50 It's like, okay, we gotta go as low as we can as fast as possible to get that momentum to shoot to the moon.
00:51:59 Trust us, trust us.
00:52:01 We'll come out the other side.
00:52:02 We'll come out the other side like a rocket.
00:52:04 We'll all be through the center of the earth and out the other side, like pew to the sun
00:52:09 to Jupiter.
00:52:09 We're going to Mars.
00:52:11 We're going to Mars with daddy Elon.
00:52:14 That's all a rich tapestry.
00:52:18 A rich, a rich laver, a rich, uh, a juicy, um.
00:52:26 Yes.
00:52:27 Yeah, okay.
00:52:32 I have to pee.
00:52:33 Give me a minute.
00:52:34 Oh no.
00:52:35 Eleazar, cut it, cut it all, cut it all, cut this.
00:52:42 Right, Eleazar, don't cut this.
00:52:44 I'm going to say, uh, Ben is peeing right now and I can hear him peeing and it sounds disgusting.
00:52:49 It's like, oh, gross.
00:52:51 Listen to that pee.
00:52:54 Put in a sound effect of, of, of water, like splashing and then, and me saying, oh, you Ben,
00:53:00 stop peeing on the pee CP.
00:53:02 Now use that clip and then cut back to whenever Ben is back and he'll be none the wiser.
00:53:10 Oh no, Ben, stop piercing.
00:53:13 There's piss everywhere.
00:53:16 You can use that clip as well.
00:53:18 Lay them on top of each other.
00:53:19 So it sounds like I'm, that there's two of me.
00:53:22 So that this is very obvious that this is an edit and it's not truly happening.
00:53:27 Oh no, Ben, stop, Ben, stop peeing on the pee CP.
00:53:30 There's piss everywhere.
00:53:43 All right, Gib.
00:53:46 Yeah?
00:53:47 I think, I think you should have a seat before I tell you what I'm about to tell you.
00:53:51 I'm sitting already.
00:53:52 That was a test to see if you would betray me and you failed.
00:53:59 What?
00:53:59 If you would tell Eleazar to put pee sound effects over the pee CP to embarrass me.
00:54:04 You failed the test.
00:54:05 Gib, I'm sorry.
00:54:07 So it wasn't actually, you didn't actually pee.
00:54:10 No, I did, no, I did, but it was also a test.
00:54:16 Impromptu test, impromptu quiz.
00:54:20 That's the thing about me is like, I'm, I'm, I'm exhausting.
00:54:23 I'm just an exhausting person to be around because I'm constantly like setting up like,
00:54:27 like little like, like tests and hurdles to jump over and like,
00:54:30 and fanciful riddles to be solved if progress is to be made.
00:54:34 You have like a nightmare.
00:54:36 Like a zip file of every DM.
00:54:39 I've ever given you so that you could use them to the greatest extents.
00:54:46 Didn't, didn't Jesse say that he had that on all of us at Redcon, at Redcon 2?
00:54:54 I feel like he did.
00:54:54 He did.
00:54:54 He was facetious, but I don't know.
00:54:56 He, I don't think he was ever going to use it.
00:54:58 Okay.
00:55:00 I thought it was, I thought it was facetious.
00:55:02 I, well, I couldn't, I couldn't tell if it was facetious or not.
00:55:04 And I, I assumed it was somebody else.
00:55:07 I won't say who.
00:55:08 I don't want to embarrass them in case I'm wrong, in case they were wrong.
00:55:10 But somebody else told me that they were like,
00:55:13 I don't know if he's joking about that.
00:55:14 And I was like, huh, um, he was probably joking.
00:55:20 There's no way, like, there's no way that he would actually do a thing where he's like
00:55:26 expose on the PCP.
00:55:27 They said, I don't know, what would they like?
00:55:31 No, you're right.
00:55:32 Like what even could there be anyway?
00:55:34 Yeah, yeah, you're right.
00:55:36 Also, I've never said anything bad.
00:55:38 True.
00:55:39 Me neither.
00:55:40 Don't listen to the early episodes of the PCP.
00:55:42 No, those were all, those were all cool.
00:55:54 You know, we all, we all, we were all laughing maniacally.
00:55:58 We were just being cool.
00:56:00 Do we know what I'm saying?
00:56:02 We were though.
00:56:03 We were being wicked cool.
00:56:04 We were unironically being based.
00:56:07 Most of the time.
00:56:08 Most of the time.
00:56:11 I don't know.
00:56:13 What are, what are we, what are we doing?
00:56:14 What are we doing here, Gib?
00:56:16 What's, what's, where's, where's this all going?
00:56:18 Like in the universe?
00:56:19 Like, what do we do?
00:56:20 Yeah.
00:56:21 Yeah.
00:56:21 We're here to.
00:56:22 Where's this headed?
00:56:23 Where, where, where, what's the, let's see where this is going.
00:56:26 Where's this all going exactly?
00:56:28 Well, it's the heat death of the universe,
00:56:29 which I'm very excited for.
00:56:31 I'm going to stream that.
00:56:32 That's going to be some great content.
00:56:33 That's going to be some great content right there.
00:56:36 I'm going to post it to my, to the future,
00:56:42 to whatever future thing still exists that you can stream on.
00:56:46 Dude, imagine like streaming like across like galaxies
00:56:50 and aliens responding in, in super chat,
00:56:52 but like 10,000 years after you finished.
00:56:56 Oh, like they're getting, they're getting the Twitch stream.
00:56:59 Yeah, they get the, like millions of years from now
00:57:01 and millions of light years away.
00:57:03 Yeah. And like, like thousands, like millions of years later,
00:57:06 like people will start getting super chats that have long since died
00:57:10 of old age.
00:57:11 And the aliens are like all based.
00:57:14 The aliens are like, the aliens are like,
00:57:17 they're sending the super chats to, to Twitch in the, yeah, I see.
00:57:22 I see.
00:57:23 Like all of the, all of the messages.
00:57:25 God, I hope the Twitch servers is still running then.
00:57:28 Oh yeah.
00:57:29 I hope Amazon still owns everything.
00:57:33 Otherwise they will never get those fucking alien bucks.
00:57:36 It was alien crypto.
00:57:42 That's kind of funny, the idea that like all of the,
00:57:44 all of the, the things that are being sent out will be returned.
00:57:51 And like if the aliens like pick up on a meme, for example,
00:57:55 they will come a thousand years too late to the party,
00:57:59 saying that meme in chat over and over and gets like,
00:58:01 what the fuck is this ancient fucking shit?
00:58:04 The cake is a lie?
00:58:06 What?
00:58:08 They're like, they're like,
00:58:11 they're only just learning about Reddit.
00:58:12 Super boomers.
00:58:13 In a hundred years.
00:58:14 Ten thousand years from now, they'll still think that like
00:58:17 minions memes on Facebook are so funny.
00:58:24 That's a pretty good idea for a, for a story.
00:58:27 I guess it is.
00:58:28 That's homestuck.
00:58:29 I guess that's homestuck.
00:58:30 I guess it, but different.
00:58:31 It did, fuck.
00:58:32 It is homestuck.
00:58:38 Aliens and memes is homestuck.
00:58:40 It's like a, what's that one?
00:58:43 It's a little bit like, is it your name?
00:58:45 Or no, what's the early one?
00:58:47 The one about the, the girl who,
00:58:49 or guy who goes into space or whatever,
00:58:51 and they have to text each other and it's like light speed.
00:58:54 So there's like time dilation.
00:58:58 Did you made that video about it a million years ago?
00:59:01 Is that interstellar?
00:59:03 Or I don't know what you're talking about.
00:59:06 Is that a game or a film?
00:59:07 No, it's a film.
00:59:08 You remember, did you did that video
00:59:09 that was the overview of all the movies
00:59:11 that that guy who made your name made?
00:59:14 And one of his early ones that he made all by himself was about.
00:59:18 Was it an anime movie?
00:59:19 I guess it must be.
00:59:20 Yeah, yeah.
00:59:21 Your name, I thought was like a book that was turned into a thing.
00:59:25 Well, it became a movie.
00:59:27 It became a, it became an anime movie.
00:59:31 I'm thinking of like, um, something.
00:59:39 Okay, Makoto, no, I gotta get it.
00:59:41 Makoto Shin Kai, one man anime.
00:59:47 What is this one?
00:59:50 No, okay, she and her cat.
00:59:52 She and her cat was the cat movie that he made.
00:59:55 And then, fuck, what was the one about fucking time dilation?
01:00:02 Now that you're talking about anime,
01:00:03 I kind of vaguely remember those phone involved.
01:00:07 Okay, Makoto Shin Kai, voices of a distant star.
01:00:12 Voices of a distant star.
01:00:14 There we go.
01:00:16 What was the point you was bringing with that?
01:00:17 Oh God, the plot of it.
01:00:19 The plot of it is that like a girl,
01:00:21 I think a girl and her boyfriend,
01:00:24 he goes into like space to be a spaceman,
01:00:27 but they want to like keep in touch and like they text each other.
01:00:32 But because of like time dilation and interstellar distances,
01:00:37 the texts are like further and further removed in time.
01:00:40 So they're like getting texts from each other
01:00:42 when they were like teenagers,
01:00:44 like when they're fucking old and shit or something.
01:00:48 And they, I don't know.
01:00:50 They don't just break up and fuck other people
01:00:52 because who gives a shit?
01:00:54 I don't know because it's very romantic.
01:00:57 They'd never know.
01:00:59 They'd never know.
01:01:00 They'd never know.
01:01:01 They'd never know.
01:01:03 They just could have been talking to an AI.
01:01:07 It's like he joins the army to go into space
01:01:10 and the AI, the AI programs him an AI
01:01:13 that will pretend to be his earth girlfriend,
01:01:15 sending him time dilated texts for the rest of his life.
01:01:22 Yeah, every so often she'll like the AI
01:01:24 will slip in a little like pro military,
01:01:27 like stay, you know, like it's really cool
01:01:29 that you're like in the military and fighting for, you know.
01:01:32 This is really helping,
01:01:33 hey, this is really helping the GDP back home.
01:01:36 Yeah, keep up the good work.
01:01:38 Like all like, oh, he's still, he's like, he's like 80.
01:01:42 He's like 80.
01:01:43 He's on like a distant galaxy or whatever.
01:01:46 And he's still, he still thinks he's getting texts
01:01:49 from his 18 year old girlfriend who is now 19,
01:01:52 you know, in his frame of reference.
01:01:56 So, you know, getting up there, but, you know, still hot.
01:02:00 And then he dies.
01:02:01 Wait, wait a minute.
01:02:03 So if the time, wait, if the time, like she's only aged one year
01:02:08 and he's aged, you know, so many years,
01:02:11 but like how have they been communicating?
01:02:14 Surely he would be like sending her a message every microsecond
01:02:20 from her perspective.
01:02:21 Like, like 80 years worth of texts come like within a week.
01:02:25 I don't know.
01:02:25 I haven't fucking watched this shit.
01:02:27 I don't give a fuck.
01:02:29 Maybe the movie explains it.
01:02:31 I don't know.
01:02:33 When he's on his death bed, he says, he's like, I guess,
01:02:35 I think, can I send nudes, please?
01:02:38 Just one.
01:02:39 He's on his, he's on his death bed and he's like,
01:02:41 wait a minute, there's a fucking plot hole.
01:02:43 This doesn't make any sense.
01:02:46 This movie sucks.
01:02:51 Licks of the camera.
01:02:52 He was the reviewer the whole time.
01:02:56 Oh, that's, that's another thing.
01:02:58 A movie where the reviewer is the main character.
01:03:01 It was called, what's his name?
01:03:04 Doug Walker's already made like 14 movies.
01:03:07 So it's too late.
01:03:10 It's too late.
01:03:11 No, no, no, those are movies made by people who review media,
01:03:14 but I'm talking like a meta movie where the reviewer of the movie
01:03:20 is the protagonist and he's like, this sucks.
01:03:23 I hate this character, meaning myself.
01:03:29 That's, I mean, didn't M. Night Shyamalan make the movie critic,
01:03:34 like the villain of Lady in the Water?
01:03:37 I guess he wasn't reviewing the movie he was in specifically.
01:03:42 It's like, wait a minute, that's a plot hole.
01:03:45 Okay.
01:03:45 The plot of the movie, it's the, there's two reviewers.
01:03:50 There's a good guy reviewer and the bad guy reviewer and the good guy reviewer.
01:03:55 His quest, his hero's journey is to convince people that the movie he is in
01:04:01 that you are watching is right now is good and the villain is to convince you
01:04:05 that it is bad, convince everyone that it is bad.
01:04:08 And it's a battle of attrition.
01:04:10 It's like a Sherlock Holmes thing where one of them is trying to like
01:04:14 point out plot holes and the other guy is like, no, actually it makes total sense because
01:04:19 yeah, it's like, it's like, um,
01:04:22 and the villain goes, ding, every sort of thing.
01:04:24 It's like, it's like Death Note, right?
01:04:25 It's like an incredible like battle of wits and they're like constantly outsmarting.
01:04:28 It's like, aha, a death of the author though.
01:04:30 And you're like, oh no, my entire argument is crumbled.
01:04:35 And, you know, just make a whole series about it.
01:04:40 Yeah, six seasons in a movie.
01:04:43 That's content rich.
01:04:45 That's content rich IP right there.
01:04:48 It's like the sequel is him grappling with the idea of sequels.
01:04:52 The movie is called Re-Colon Viewer.
01:05:01 Or Re-Viewers, I don't know.
01:05:04 Fuck yeah, this is, this shit, you know what?
01:05:09 I take back everything I said about not, now I know what I'm doing.
01:05:13 I'm making this shit for the rest of my life as soon as the secret project is done.
01:05:18 Fuck all that other shit.
01:05:19 Fuck, uh, fuck Biscopades.
01:05:20 Fuck the champion.
01:05:21 It's on to Re-Viewer.
01:05:24 I mean, it's just a winning formula.
01:05:26 Really, the best ideas are the ones that make you laugh regardless of whether they're good.
01:05:33 Yeah.
01:05:35 Because the stuff that makes me happy is like thinking of, I had this,
01:05:39 this is, I didn't end up doing it because it was so stupid.
01:05:42 But it was just like, I was thinking of getting a random YouTube video and then
01:05:47 just occasionally replacing one of the nouns with
01:05:52 dinner from like Zelda, CDI, cutscene, YouTube poop quote.
01:05:56 Where the king says, I wonder what's for dinner, getting that clip and just saying,
01:06:02 like Marques Brownlee with the new dinner phone.
01:06:05 And I was laughing so much at the idea that I could just do that at any moment.
01:06:10 I could edit that and it would be so easy.
01:06:12 So easy.
01:06:13 It would be nothing could be simpler.
01:06:16 It was just the funniest idea and I'd laugh myself to sleep.
01:06:18 It was great.
01:06:20 Fascinating.
01:06:20 I didn't do it though because it was so pointless.
01:06:24 I had other things to do with my life.
01:06:26 Yeah.
01:06:27 Yeah, that's true.
01:06:29 Life's the little things though, you know?
01:06:32 It is.
01:06:32 Yeah.
01:06:34 One day, if you don't stop to make a YouTube poop once in a while, you might miss it.
01:06:42 True.
01:06:42 Yeah, life comes at you fast.
01:06:46 What the fuck are we talking about?
01:06:49 Nothing.
01:06:49 Anime?
01:06:50 Fuck that.
01:06:52 Fuck that shit.
01:06:52 What is your favorite anime?
01:06:54 Dark Souls.
01:07:01 Oh, it is made by Amiyazaki.
01:07:03 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:07:04 My favorite Amiyazaki movie.
01:07:06 Yeah, I'm sure.
01:07:07 Someone's made that fucking joke before.
01:07:09 No, nobody's made that joke because it's so stupid.
01:07:12 It's so obvious.
01:07:13 It's awful.
01:07:14 Everyone else was too ashamed.
01:07:17 But it's a race to the bottom and I won.
01:07:20 My tears are lubricating.
01:07:22 I made it.
01:07:23 I got there so fast, I'm going to shoo up the opposite slope up the mountain.
01:07:28 Speedrun being so depressed that you become God.
01:07:34 Oh, God, speaking of becoming God, I beat Noida.
01:07:40 I beat Noida.
01:07:41 I was playing Noida again right before we started.
01:07:43 I had to stop playing Noida to record this stupid podcast.
01:07:46 Noida is so fucking cool.
01:07:48 I can't even stand it.
01:07:50 You beat it?
01:07:52 I beat it.
01:07:52 What's at the bottom?
01:07:55 A boss.
01:07:57 Well, I will know.
01:07:58 Okay.
01:07:59 I mean, should I spoil Noida?
01:08:00 Do you want me to spoil Noida?
01:08:02 I haven't even looked at the game, well, except for that one time.
01:08:07 So I don't know.
01:08:08 I don't really like rogue-like things.
01:08:12 I mean, it's not.
01:08:12 Random chance for upgrades annoys me.
01:08:15 Oh, it's so fucking good.
01:08:17 I mean, okay, I'll just approve that I'm a badass.
01:08:20 I'm going to spoil Noida.
01:08:22 Cover your ears for a second.
01:08:24 You get to the bottom.
01:08:26 You get to the last level, and you fight a boss.
01:08:29 You fight a boss, and you kill him, and you pick up this thing.
01:08:36 You pick up this mysterious thing called...
01:08:40 The place you go is called the work, and you pick up this thing called the salt,
01:08:44 and you put the salt in this machine, and the machine activates,
01:08:49 and the entire world...
01:08:50 There's a shockwave, and the entire world turns to gold,
01:08:54 and you also turn to gold, and you die.
01:08:57 And it's fucking cool.
01:09:00 But apparently that's like the bad ending for babies, and there are like...
01:09:04 If you do other things along your way to winning,
01:09:08 you can get other endings where you don't die or other things happen.
01:09:12 And also the salt is apparently called other things in other circumstances,
01:09:17 and there is a whole bunch of like...
01:09:20 Okay, this is fucking crazy.
01:09:22 You can...
01:09:23 There are all these orbs scattered around the places,
01:09:27 and you've got to get orbs, and you've got to get orbs,
01:09:29 and more orbs means you get different endings.
01:09:32 And there are secret places, like to the left of the starting area,
01:09:35 there's this giant tree, and if you climb this giant tree and go over it,
01:09:39 there's like a whole other section over there.
01:09:41 And if you go to the right, and instead of going under the mountain
01:09:44 to start delving down into the mines and get to the real ending,
01:09:48 if you can climb over the mountain or like burrow your way through it,
01:09:51 you come out the other side, and there's like a whole desert over there,
01:09:54 and the desert leads to some other weird shit.
01:09:57 And if you go into the sky, there's like a secret altar there,
01:10:01 and if you place emerald tablets on the altar, you get stuff for it.
01:10:06 And if you go even above that altar,
01:10:09 you can get to an infinite zone that is also called the work,
01:10:14 but it's in the sky, and if you go above the sky work,
01:10:19 you can go to the moon.
01:10:21 You can literally go to the moon.
01:10:23 So it's like terraria, but they actually have where you can jump to space.
01:10:29 A little bit, I guess.
01:10:31 I mean, you go to the moon, and apparently the moon is made
01:10:35 of a unique material that is found nowhere else in the game,
01:10:37 and it is called cheese.
01:10:41 And if you bring these like secret essences to the moon
01:10:46 and give it to the moon, the moon will crack open,
01:10:49 and these like secret fluids that are like nowhere else,
01:10:54 that are secret rare fluids will like explode out of the moon.
01:11:02 I mean, it's obviously awesome.
01:11:03 I haven't done any of this.
01:11:04 I've just been reading the Wiki about all this.
01:11:06 It's fucked up, man.
01:11:07 So does that mean the the player character is Wallace or Gromit?
01:11:13 The player character is an alchemist.
01:11:16 This is something that is not, it's not really,
01:11:19 it's not really stated anywhere.
01:11:22 The name of the game, Noida, it means witch in Finnish.
01:11:26 So you think you were a witch, but I think you are actually an alchemist
01:11:29 because like the end of the game is about turning things to gold,
01:11:33 and there are other monsters in the game that kind of look like you,
01:11:37 that are called things that are like alchemist name,
01:11:42 and everything in the game is named in Finnish,
01:11:44 and I guess the whole thing is based in Finnish folklore, apparently.
01:11:50 So fucking cool. Oh my god.
01:11:57 I do like the whole cheese moon thing,
01:12:00 but more importantly, the fact that you can go up and up and even up her,
01:12:06 I like secrets behind secrets.
01:12:09 I'm not exactly sure how you get there.
01:12:12 If it's just a matter of finding a way to go high enough,
01:12:15 or if there's some other thing you have to do,
01:12:18 but the moon is there, you can go to it.
01:12:26 I didn't know that the entire map is connected,
01:12:29 because like you finish a level, you go through a portal,
01:12:32 and it brings you to like a temple,
01:12:34 where you can fuck around with your wands and change your wands up,
01:12:37 and then you go down to the next level and you do it all over again,
01:12:39 find a new portal, down to the next temple.
01:12:41 I didn't realize this, but apparently the entire world is connected,
01:12:44 and I found this out when I went down to like the third level, the snow area,
01:12:50 and I just went over to the right, and I went really far to the right,
01:12:54 and I found a rock wall that just went up and up and up,
01:12:57 and I was like, okay.
01:12:58 So I climbed this rock wall for a long time,
01:13:02 and I eventually found that it was the opening under a rope bridge
01:13:07 that I had found earlier for another secret area in the first area of the game.
01:13:11 The rope bridge goes over a gap, there's a lava sea,
01:13:14 and then there's a rope bridge,
01:13:15 and then there's this other temple where you can find an orb,
01:13:19 and a secret boss appears if you take the orb and you got to kill it.
01:13:22 So I climbed up from the third level all the way up to the first one,
01:13:26 and I didn't even know that was a thing you could do, but I did it.
01:13:31 Cool.
01:13:31 Cool, cool fucking game.
01:13:35 Super, I love it more and more every single day.
01:13:38 Have to got to recommend, hey, post in the comment if you fucking beat Noida,
01:13:44 bet you fucking won't, cowards.
01:13:47 I had, I don't know, I was, no, I'm going to resist the urge to go on a whole tear about
01:13:59 all the cool ones that I built.
01:14:03 The one that I won with was essentially just a machine gun.
01:14:06 It just like, that was it.
01:14:10 Simple, effective.
01:14:13 I've been playing a lot of Minecraft.
01:14:17 Recently.
01:14:19 I listened to the Money Spenders podcast at patreon.com slash give and take,
01:14:25 so I know that you've been paying, and if you listen to the other podcast
01:14:30 at patreon.com slash Ben St, you would know about Noida.
01:14:33 Then you can hear me talk about my wands, if you want to know how I did it,
01:14:39 if you want to know how I achieved the ultimate high level gamer achievement
01:14:43 and beat Noida, you can listen to that over there, and I will explain everything.
01:14:48 Yeah.
01:14:48 Dab, dab, dab.
01:14:49 Okay, but anyway, Minecraft.
01:14:51 Yeah, Minecraft.
01:14:52 I've been furiously getting the big upgrades in this one server, and I have now the drip.
01:15:02 I've got a full set of Netherite armor.
01:15:06 And-
01:15:07 Is that better than Diamond?
01:15:08 Yes, it's the one that's slightly better than Diamond Armor, and it doesn't burn,
01:15:12 and it floats in lava, and it's very cool.
01:15:17 And let me just check.
01:15:18 I'm just going to log on to the server so I can see, because I've been getting so many
01:15:25 enchantments, like enchantment books.
01:15:28 I'm just going to list all the enchantments I have, because I think I have every possible
01:15:32 good enchantment on all of this armor, and I'm just proud of my gamer breaking blocks and jumping.
01:15:42 It's not very difficult.
01:15:45 Actually, there's taken a while to load whatever.
01:15:47 How do you get Netherite?
01:15:50 In Netherite, you have to, in the Nether, with the updates, there's a new block called
01:15:55 Netherite scraps or something.
01:16:00 You break a block, and it's really hard to find.
01:16:02 There's only like one, maybe three in a cluster.
01:16:06 You get it, and then you smelt it into Netherite scraps.
01:16:10 Oh, yeah.
01:16:11 Ancient debris.
01:16:12 It's a block called Ancient Debris.
01:16:15 You turn it into Netherite scraps.
01:16:17 You combine those scraps, four of those scraps, with four gold ingots, and you get one Netherite
01:16:22 ingot, and then you take a diamond thing, and you get a smithing table, and you combine
01:16:29 the Netherite ingot with the diamond thing to turn it into a Netherite thing.
01:16:35 I see, I see.
01:16:37 So, yeah, it's pretty cool.
01:16:40 Yeah, the moment I've got on my Netherite helmet, protection for aqua affinity,
01:16:45 which means I can breathe underwater, I think.
01:16:47 No, that means I can mine things underwater, as if I were on land.
01:16:53 Unbreaking three, respiration three, which means I can breathe underwater, and mending,
01:16:57 which means every time I get experience orbs, it mends the armor.
01:17:03 Oh, that's cool.
01:17:04 That's pretty good.
01:17:05 Yeah, I've got mending on all four of my things.
01:17:08 My boots are the coolest.
01:17:09 They've got blast protection four, feather falling four, which means I don't take damage
01:17:13 from falling that much.
01:17:15 It's got mending, it's got depth strider three, which means I walk and move really fast in water.
01:17:21 I can walk upper waterfall, I can walk against the current easily, and soul speed three,
01:17:27 which means I can walk super hyper first on soul sand.
01:17:33 Only on soul sand though, so in the Nether, right?
01:17:36 In the Nether, yeah, but I can build a road with soul sand and then zoom across faster than
01:17:42 normal running, and then I can also run on top of that.
01:17:48 So yeah, really, I've been doing work on my secret project,
01:17:53 and I've been playing Minecraft on the off hours, and I love Minecraft.
01:17:58 It's just so nice, I don't think it's a nine to five I'm working right now,
01:18:08 but on my secret project, my thing that I did talk about on my Money Spenders podcast,
01:18:13 Go Listen, it has taken up a lot of my normal working hours time, and on the weekends,
01:18:22 I'm basically doing nothing but Minecraft and podcasts and streams and stuff,
01:18:27 listening to vowsh vowsh.
01:18:33 That reminds me that we have, it's been a little while since we did a Shekels for Hackles,
01:18:38 maybe we should do another one soon.
01:18:39 Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
01:18:41 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
01:18:44 I have not been watching any Vosh, or any, I don't know if Vosh is considered bread tube,
01:18:53 but I have not been watching any like bread tube lately.
01:18:56 It pretty clearly is, why do you think so?
01:18:59 Yeah, why would you, what do you know about it?
01:19:02 I don't know, when I, I mean I know all about Vosh, like I've seen a bunch of his stuff,
01:19:07 I was watching it a bunch for a while there, I don't know, I guess when I think of bread tube,
01:19:12 I think of like essayists more than streamers.
01:19:14 Oh yeah, okay, he's a person on YouTube who is bread flavored.
01:19:20 Yeah, yeah sure, I have not, I have not been, I mean I haven't been watching,
01:19:26 I haven't been watching Thought Slime, who I was watching religiously for a while there,
01:19:31 I haven't seen the new ContraPoints, the last two ContraPoints actually,
01:19:36 I haven't watched the new Philosophy Tube yet, I am just like, I don't know,
01:19:43 I am just not feeling very motivated to think about, or I, I don't know,
01:19:52 feel like I kind of like get it already, you know?
01:19:55 Yeah, I find them to be generally entertaining, especially Philosophy Tube and ContraPoints,
01:20:00 just video wise, they're very like good.
01:20:03 They are.
01:20:04 And so I've been re-watching a lot of those.
01:20:06 I mean, I, I mean, I really like, I really like Sean, what was the last one he did?
01:20:13 What was the last Sean film that came out?
01:20:14 Didn't he, didn't he, I don't know if it was recent, but I saw he was,
01:20:17 made a huge long video about World War II and how stuff happened.
01:20:22 Yeah, that was it, that was it, it was, that was, oh, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
01:20:26 Yeah, yeah, why did the nukes, I got like 10 minutes into that,
01:20:30 but then I got distracted by something else and I haven't gone back to it.
01:20:33 That's a good one, that's, that's a pretty good one.
01:20:36 Um, it's, I mean, it's more about history than like him making,
01:20:41 I mean, he does make the case for why the bombing was bad,
01:20:44 but it's, although a lot of it is like explaining the history
01:20:48 of it and like what was going on with like Japanese politics
01:20:53 and American politics and et cetera, et cetera.
01:20:56 Um, that's, that one felt more history-ish and less bread-to-be, although I mean, it's both.
01:21:03 Uh, lol.
01:21:04 Um, I watched a video about Quentin Reviews.
01:21:11 I saw this video recommended to me and this guy was explained,
01:21:16 he was like, he had made a previous video called like the fall of Quentin Reviews
01:21:21 and he had made like another update video to that,
01:21:24 specifically about the DMs thing with Sarah Z and Lindsay Ellis.
01:21:30 And this guy, I mean, I agreed with some of the things he said and he, he wasn't,
01:21:37 he wasn't even like, he wasn't that harsh.
01:21:42 Like he was very critical of Quentin, but it wasn't,
01:21:44 he wasn't like unbelievably so and he was very, he says like,
01:21:47 you know, Quentin isn't like a complete lol cow.
01:21:49 He's not like a, a, a complete train wreck.
01:21:52 I just find him very fascinating because he has his like very like pathetic personality
01:21:57 and he makes, and he gives some examples of like how Quentin is very like,
01:22:00 very approval-seeking in general and very like, you know,
01:22:05 whinging and stuff.
01:22:06 Um, but like a bunch, a bunch of the time it slips through,
01:22:12 it slips through that like what this person, what this person considers to be a fall of a Titan,
01:22:18 so to speak, is like that he, you know, decided that like, uh, uh, you know,
01:22:24 actually like right-wingers are bad, right?
01:22:27 Like it slips through that like this person has,
01:22:30 so there'd be, there'd like, there'd be an like quote unquote objective,
01:22:34 but once in a while you're like, this person has an opinion and I can, and I can tell.
01:22:37 Oh wait, his, his angle is Quentin reviews doesn't like right-wingers
01:22:42 and that's why he's a Fallen Titan.
01:22:44 Well, that's not really his argument.
01:22:46 That's his argument is that Quentin is like,
01:22:50 bad, he behaves badly and he's cringe for all these reasons and he gives it,
01:22:55 you know, pretty reasonable examples of like, yeah, of like, yeah, that is pretty cringe
01:22:59 that he did, that he did and he said those things true.
01:23:01 But then they're saying like,
01:23:02 as he, as he's talking about it, he will, he will touch on like, oh, and then,
01:23:06 and when, you know, Quentin changed his politics and when he talks about that,
01:23:10 he, it's like, uh, this person is not neutral.
01:23:13 No, that's, yeah.
01:23:16 It, it really, oh whatever.
01:23:19 But I mean, I guess, I guess.
01:23:20 Like, I don't know much too much about him.
01:23:22 I watched a few of his videos once and he seems, he, I think he was like,
01:23:28 one of the first YouTubers I had clicked on a video on that had a more reasonable
01:23:35 view of, of things like, like Anita Sarkeesian or something, like he was criticism,
01:23:41 like it was the first left E thing I'd ever looked at.
01:23:44 Okay, okay.
01:23:45 And I was like, huh, that's interesting.
01:23:47 But then he's got,
01:23:48 since then he's like, he's like quite normal, not that interesting, not, I don't know.
01:23:52 Okay, well, I mean, famously he had that bit where he like,
01:23:56 in the middle of an unrelated review, he went on the rant about how much he hates Trump.
01:24:01 That was, yeah, I, I heard about that.
01:24:03 And it's like, okay, that's a little cringe.
01:24:07 That's a little cringe.
01:24:08 And I think we can all agree.
01:24:09 We can all, you know, left or right, you know, like black people, hate black people,
01:24:12 we can all agree that that's kind of cringe.
01:24:15 I kind of remember it being relevant, but I don't know.
01:24:20 I thought it was at the beginning, like if something, something, something,
01:24:24 okay, here's the thing.
01:24:25 I kind of hate Donald Trump, blah, blah, blah, obvious things.
01:24:30 And then he went on to talk about a cartoon or something.
01:24:34 I can't, I can't remember really.
01:24:36 But like, I don't feel like that was super cringe.
01:24:38 Had Trump in it or something?
01:24:40 Or was it, I don't know, I don't know.
01:24:42 But the, but the, but the point is like, you know, some, some people,
01:24:46 like, like when this guy was talking about that event, he doesn't, he says that it's cringe,
01:24:52 but then he talks about like the fallout.
01:24:55 He talks about, he specifically mentions monkey.
01:24:58 He talks about like the fallout that it led to with people like monkey
01:25:01 over Quinton's quote unquote divisive politics.
01:25:04 He specifically calls these divisive politics saying orange man bad and how like it cost
01:25:10 him friends that he said stuff like this.
01:25:12 And, and like that's when it's like, it's not just, it's not just about the cringe
01:25:16 for you though, is it?
01:25:18 It's not, there's more to it there.
01:25:20 Just, just say it, just fucking come out and say it.
01:25:23 Didn't Quinton go on that podcast with monkey, monkey and, and plemin and rusty cage?
01:25:29 What was it called?
01:25:31 State of the YouTube?
01:25:32 Yeah, I think he was on that.
01:25:34 I don't know, maybe he was.
01:25:37 I know they had, I know they had the thing where like when monkey got banned,
01:25:40 Quinton like said, ha ha, fuck you.
01:25:42 And then everyone was like, and then everyone was like,
01:25:46 no, Quinton, that's not cool.
01:25:48 He's been banned from YouTube.
01:25:50 You can't say that.
01:25:50 And Quinton was like, oh, I'm sorry.
01:25:52 I didn't know that being mean, I didn't know that being mean was mean.
01:25:56 And like, that's very cringy, that's very, that's very, that's very cringe.
01:26:00 That's very cringe because if you think that like, oh, you know, this is serious.
01:26:03 I shouldn't, you know, gloat over the, I, okay.
01:26:06 Why would you do it in the first place?
01:26:07 People said, yeah, then why would you do it in the first place?
01:26:10 People said, like this, this guy argued that like, oh, Quinton said that people
01:26:13 shouldn't be censored, but then he was happy when monkey was censored.
01:26:17 That hypocrisy.
01:26:19 If you think that monkey is bad, if you really think he's terrible,
01:26:23 then just, yeah, just, just be happy that he got banned.
01:26:27 Like, what's the problem?
01:26:28 Who cares if people, if like idiots call you a hypocrite for it.
01:26:31 You're not one unless, I mean, unless you are, unless you said like,
01:26:35 no one should ever be banned from YouTube.
01:26:36 And then someone gets banned from YouTube and you're like, haha, you know.
01:26:40 But I don't think that's the case.
01:26:41 Yeah.
01:26:43 People apologize a little too easily.
01:26:44 Quinton, Quinton is the kind of person who was like, yeah.
01:26:47 Yeah, like I, I would much rather he like make a statement and stick with it.
01:26:53 Like if he doesn't like monkey and he thinks monkey's bad to say it.
01:26:57 Sure.
01:26:57 Then just, then just own it.
01:26:59 Then just own it.
01:27:00 The fact that he took it back is like, well, why did you,
01:27:03 did you want to score points by saying that?
01:27:05 Which one do you actually believe?
01:27:07 Yeah.
01:27:07 Yeah.
01:27:08 True.
01:27:08 True.
01:27:12 You gotta take a stand, it's all in your hand.
01:27:18 You know what that is?
01:27:19 It's a song, probably.
01:27:21 That's the opening theme song to the Animorphs Live Action Nickelodeon television series.
01:27:29 Oh.
01:27:30 Oh.
01:27:31 I wonder if there's any more Animorphing Time.
01:27:36 I listen to every episode of Animorphing Time, the leftist Animorphs podcast.
01:27:42 And I ran out.
01:27:43 There was no more to listen to.
01:27:45 They only released like once or twice a month.
01:27:48 Sad.
01:27:48 Sad but true.
01:27:50 I crave more.
01:27:55 I could probably, I could probably read through the rest of Animorphs in less time
01:28:00 than it would take me to
01:28:04 listen to the rest of that podcast that will go through the whole series.
01:28:08 Because you can read these books in like an hour or two and each episode is like that long or more.
01:28:13 So, you know, is it efficient?
01:28:15 No.
01:28:16 But it's funny.
01:28:20 Brrr.
01:28:21 Brrr.
01:28:22 Yeah.
01:28:22 Okay.
01:28:23 Sorry.
01:28:23 That's my Animorph impression.
01:28:24 Brrr.
01:28:25 Brrr.
01:28:26 Should we go to VoiceMails?
01:28:28 You said that we had a lot to get through, or at least a lot of them.
01:28:32 We may skip all of them.
01:28:33 Why?
01:28:34 Am I floundering?
01:28:35 Are we floundering?
01:28:36 No, but we've been going for an hour and a half.
01:28:39 You're right.
01:28:39 We have.
01:28:40 Yeah.
01:28:40 Okay.
01:28:41 We do have, yeah, we have a shit ton of VoiceMails this time.
01:28:44 I don't know why.
01:28:48 Okay.
01:28:49 You have it?
01:28:49 You have it up?
01:28:50 You're ready?
01:28:50 Uh, yes.
01:28:53 Okay.
01:28:53 The first one is called My Fence.
01:28:56 Three, two, one, go.
01:29:01 Oh my god.
01:29:01 Fuck are you?
01:29:03 Okay.
01:29:05 Until next time, sayonara.
01:29:09 Oh, hey, you know what?
01:29:10 Always nice to hear a friendly voice.
01:29:14 In the, you know what?
01:29:14 We're off to a riotously good start, I would say.
01:29:19 Okay.
01:29:21 Polite, polite Japanese clapping.
01:29:24 Okay.
01:29:25 Next one is called Less Child Abuse, Please.
01:29:30 Parentheses.
01:29:31 Site is spelled verped.
01:29:34 Three, two, one, go.
01:29:36 Discourse around pedophilia and maps is so dangerously fucked.
01:29:40 Like the way it is now is what you'd imagine if you wanted to maximize instances of abuse.
01:29:44 As a society, the terms pedophile and sexual predator
01:29:47 are often treated as interchangeable.
01:29:49 We imply that anybody who is attracted to children must be abusing them.
01:29:53 But that isn't true.
01:29:54 Actual cases of abuse are more often to do with children being easy targets
01:29:58 for people in positions of authority.
01:30:00 When it comes to actual pedophiles or maps, it's a totally different story.
01:30:04 By and large, they know it's fucked up and intentionally deny their sexual impulses.
01:30:07 They don't choose to be that way and usually actively wish they were not.
01:30:12 But if society constantly tells who you're a monster, you often start to believe it.
01:30:16 These people bear the weight of sexual deprivation under society that tells them
01:30:19 they're basically as good as an abuser already.
01:30:22 They can't tell anyone about it for fear of repercussion, so they have to bottle it up.
01:30:25 They grow to hate themselves and are under perpetual mental duress.
01:30:28 This is not how you get someone to live a healthy lifestyle.
01:30:31 This is how you get someone to give in to their vices and or kill themselves.
01:30:35 People don't realize how many are secretly struggling with this.
01:30:38 Pedophiles are among us whether we like it or not,
01:30:40 and our goal should be to support their efforts to not give in.
01:30:43 Virpend.org has a bunch of testimonials and resources to help understand the issue.
01:30:48 The branding of virtuous pedophiles is really bad,
01:30:51 but I suppose that's inevitable in this realm.
01:30:57 I guess I agree with all that.
01:31:00 Yeah, I guess I'd have to look at the Virpend, V-I-R-P-E-D.
01:31:06 There is something really off putting about the name virtuous pedophiles, though.
01:31:12 That is, I don't like saying it.
01:31:14 Like, yeah.
01:31:15 Oh my god, that is just what it's called.
01:31:19 That's just what it's called.
01:31:21 I mean, yeah, I mean, it's true.
01:31:25 Welcome to virtuous pedophiles.
01:31:27 Oh god, I have heard that before, and it makes sense, and I believe it,
01:31:34 that actual abuse often is just a case of a person can do it.
01:31:41 They're in a position where they can do it.
01:31:44 That's why it happens so much in the church historically,
01:31:49 is because that was very much a situation that these people were empowered to do it, so they did it.
01:31:55 They were empowered not because it was a sexual attraction thing necessarily,
01:32:00 or is that also part of it?
01:32:03 I don't know, but yeah, it's more about can you than about, oh, you have a mental condition.
01:32:19 Yeah, I definitely agree with the idea that you can't necessarily help your vice,
01:32:26 not your vice, it's your predilections, what turns you on is sometimes out of your control,
01:32:35 it's your actions that you can control.
01:32:38 Sure, and I mean, I totally agree.
01:32:40 So people, if they end up having an attraction to children, obviously they should never do that,
01:32:49 and the way we treat the conversation around pedophilia is very,
01:32:53 like, no discussion necessary.
01:32:55 If it's even slightly potentially the case, then we should just scorch the earth, burn,
01:33:00 and just destroy them.
01:33:03 No room for any discussion at all because children are involved, and I get people's
01:33:10 wariness, because it feels very weird to even think of the phrase virtuous pedophiles these days.
01:33:23 I think if it is the case that people have these things and they don't wish to act on them,
01:33:32 that is at least evidence that not everyone who is attracted to children
01:33:39 is necessarily an abuser.
01:33:41 So yeah, I guess there's a discussion to have.
01:33:44 Yeah, I mean, I am for whatever, this is the tough questions, we're dealing with the PQ
01:33:52 right now, the pedophile question.
01:33:54 And the answer that I prefer is, in it first, a solution that results in the fewest children
01:34:01 being abused, which yeah, it's probably the case that letting people that are like this,
01:34:10 and like you said, they are going to exist no matter what.
01:34:14 So letting people like that get help or whatever that looks like,
01:34:21 and not be shamed just for existing, as long as they're not hurting anyone.
01:34:30 And then secondary to not abusing children is, in addition to that, also dealing with these
01:34:35 people who are making their doing what they need to do not to hurt anyone, dealing with them
01:34:42 humanely is also good, so I agree.
01:34:46 Controversial statement there maybe, but yeah, sure.
01:34:49 No, this guy's right.
01:34:50 Yeah, I agree as well.
01:34:52 It's just frustrating, because I know the issue is so much about anybody who would want to have
01:35:05 the conversation, runs the risk of being just shit-talked and thought of as a pedophile online.
01:35:14 Like, oh, you even think about defending, like the rehabilitation, that's just major cringe.
01:35:22 You're probably a pedophile yourself, actually, and then it's all like-
01:35:25 As a registered Democrat, I want us to be as open and generous with pedophiles as possible,
01:35:34 because I stan all of them, they are all my gods, they are my kings and queens,
01:35:41 and I won't let anyone besmirch them.
01:35:46 Yeah, I don't know how to go about this sort of thing, but I guess verped, verped.
01:35:52 Who we are, FAQ.
01:35:55 I'm not going to read the website, I don't care that much.
01:35:59 I'll at least skip it, I mean, I don't know.
01:36:02 I guess.
01:36:04 Next one?
01:36:06 Yeah.
01:36:07 Okay, okay, next one is called cringe or based, episode one, three, two, one, go.
01:36:15 Based.
01:36:17 Nice.
01:36:18 Oh, clever, clever new show on the voicemails.
01:36:25 We have to guess if it is going to be cringe or based each episode.
01:36:31 Well, what an exciting new chapter in the PCP.
01:36:35 I'm so excited to see the next one and to be correct when I flip that coin.
01:36:43 Okay, next one, don't forget to eat your greens, three, two, one, go.
01:36:50 Don't forget to eat your greens.
01:36:53 Nice.
01:36:54 Sure.
01:36:54 Hey, this is apropos of nothing.
01:36:58 We've talked about this a little bit.
01:37:01 I've mentioned it and we have kind of like skirted around the idea and it's but it's been
01:37:06 floating around like maybe I don't know how I feel about it anymore.
01:37:09 I mean, should we rebrand the PCP a little bit?
01:37:14 Because we're like things are clearly different now.
01:37:17 Should we do that?
01:37:18 I keep, I have thought for a while that we should, but it almost feels like it's too late,
01:37:24 but like that's stupid, right?
01:37:26 I guess it's not too late.
01:37:28 We could change branding and it'd be like the Ben and Gibb and sometimes Tom show.
01:37:36 Yeah.
01:37:37 What would we, what would change though about like the show itself?
01:37:41 What would, would we talk about specific things or?
01:37:44 What if we got, I mean, just if I'm, if I'm spitballing here, what if we got like a new theme song,
01:37:50 maybe a new intro?
01:37:52 We don't really do like, wait, I don't, I don't watch this garbage.
01:37:58 Does it still do the, the oblivion fall like animated, like spinning intro?
01:38:02 Yeah, yeah.
01:38:06 Well, I mean, maybe we could change that or, or, or get a new one, get a new theme, new song,
01:38:12 new thing, new, new banner.
01:38:13 I mean, we wouldn't have to change like the thumbnails or anything.
01:38:17 The thumbnails are fine.
01:38:18 I don't know.
01:38:19 I just feel like it would be appropriate.
01:38:22 I guess you're right.
01:38:23 I just don't know how to go about it.
01:38:25 I don't, I don't know.
01:38:26 Would we change the title of the podcast?
01:38:28 Would we like new podcast, episode one, or would it just be?
01:38:32 No, no.
01:38:35 Procrastinators.
01:38:36 Hey, I mean, it would be fun.
01:38:37 I mean, okay, imagine, imagine that the PCP goes on for another five years, right?
01:38:43 It would be kind of a, it would be sort of weird to have like a period of the PCP where like,
01:38:52 okay, this was the period where it was mostly Ben and Gibb, right?
01:38:56 And, but only like the latter like portion of it has like the different theme song.
01:39:02 Like most of it just sounds like any other is like branded the same as any other part of it.
01:39:06 But like the latter piece of it is like branded differently.
01:39:11 I guess the, when I say it out loud, when I say it out loud, it doesn't sound like that.
01:39:15 Who cares?
01:39:16 They'll just be like, all right, who cares?
01:39:18 Who gives a fuck?
01:39:19 We should change it.
01:39:20 I think we should.
01:39:21 We should change it.
01:39:22 We should change it.
01:39:24 Maybe we could change the name to be instead of PCP, we could just have the Procrastinators
01:39:31 or like the Procrastinators podcast, like a, instead of PCP, I've never really,
01:39:37 I don't know, I just feel like PCP is like, it's a drug thing.
01:39:41 And like anyone new will be like, where, where are they going to do the drugs?
01:39:45 When are they going to do it?
01:39:48 Maybe, maybe.
01:39:50 I mean, it's like a pun that has never been relevant at all.
01:39:53 It's true.
01:39:54 It's true.
01:39:57 I think, can we, can we put out a call for like a new theme song?
01:40:02 Can we have another contest?
01:40:04 We can have a little, yeah, another little contest.
01:40:07 And then any suggestions for like, you know, ways to change the way the show looks.
01:40:15 And here's, here's, here's what I think.
01:40:17 Here's what, okay, you know what, you know what?
01:40:18 Let's just say that like, hey, anyone who wants to, anyone who's interested, who thinks it would
01:40:25 be cool, can like contact us, maybe add us on Twitter or whatever.
01:40:31 And shiv is like, if you want to try and like write a new theme song or make a new like banner
01:40:37 image or anything like that.
01:40:40 I don't think I would change the logo, like the channel icon.
01:40:44 TPC, CD thing?
01:40:47 Yeah, yeah, that seems like going, that seems like going a little, a little far.
01:40:53 But yeah, I don't know.
01:40:54 We're looking to rebrand.
01:40:56 And if you think you would be funny to do something and you can show it to us.
01:41:02 And if we use it, we will say thank you.
01:41:06 We will say thank you.
01:41:07 We will say thank you.
01:41:08 We will shout out your thing if you have one.
01:41:11 Yes.
01:41:12 Yes, yes, yes.
01:41:14 Um, okay, okay.
01:41:16 Next voicemail is Kringus Bingus, episode four.
01:41:21 Are you ready?
01:41:22 Three, two, one, go.
01:41:26 Hey, dear PCP, it's me, Kringus Bingus.
01:41:28 I'm going to get right into it.
01:41:30 What I creamed that was the fact that over the weekend, somebody got my credit card information
01:41:39 and used it to pay for some OnlyFans, somebody's OnlyFans.
01:41:45 Sorry, that was me.
01:41:46 Sorry, that was me.
01:41:46 Only like $35 of OnlyFans transactions.
01:41:52 And it was really silly.
01:41:53 So I had to cancel my card and I was driving to the bank to get a new one.
01:41:56 So that's silly.
01:41:57 That's very Kring.
01:41:59 What I binged was some anime.
01:42:01 There's some good seasonal shows that have a few episodes out that I enjoyed.
01:42:06 No.
01:42:07 There's also an older show.
01:42:09 From 2017 called Aka 13.
01:42:12 It's okay.
01:42:13 It's pretty good.
01:42:13 It's like a political drama type of thing.
01:42:17 I enjoyed my time with it.
01:42:19 Aka 13 never heard of it.
01:42:21 A follow up from last time, I said my mom had COVID.
01:42:28 I did not have COVID and she's doing okay.
01:42:31 I just wanted to get a check in about that.
01:42:33 This is Kringus Bingus signing off.
01:42:36 Thank you, favorite PCP voicemail caller.
01:42:39 Thank you, Kringus Bingus.
01:42:40 We love you.
01:42:44 Always nice to get an update from Kringus Bingus.
01:42:48 I like to bing at Kringus Bingus instead of bing.
01:42:51 I never kring at Kringus Bingus and I always bing Kringus Bingus.
01:42:58 Very good.
01:43:02 Wait a minute.
01:43:04 Before we go on, I just remembered something that I want to shout out.
01:43:08 I have not shouted out enough of Krugsmash on this channel.
01:43:16 Is that the Digimon or the Dwarf Fortress?
01:43:21 The Digimon person.
01:43:24 No, it's the Dwarf Fortress guy.
01:43:27 Yes.
01:43:28 Someone, okay, it was a lemon tart from who worked on the PCP dating sim.
01:43:40 He was part of that.
01:43:43 Messaged me to be like, Ben, I gave Krugsmash a try.
01:43:48 I watched the splatter face, like you said, and he was like, thank you.
01:43:52 It was great.
01:43:53 It was a masterpiece.
01:43:54 I loved it.
01:43:54 I'm going to go and watch Monster Killer the Fortress series next because it was so great.
01:44:00 And I was like, yes, fuck, yes, excellent.
01:44:04 Love it.
01:44:05 That made my day.
01:44:06 I hope more, I hope other people discover Krugsmash through my recommendations.
01:44:11 He is back, splatter face is over.
01:44:13 He has gone back to a new quote unquote fortress called the watchful eyes.
01:44:19 And the watchful eyes is sick.
01:44:21 It is nothing.
01:44:22 It is completely different from all the other fortresses he has done.
01:44:25 It rules.
01:44:26 It's great.
01:44:28 But don't go right into watchful eyes because it is a direct continuation
01:44:32 from scorched fountains, which I think was a direct continuation from Honey Stoker,
01:44:37 which I think was a direct continuation from Monster Killer.
01:44:41 So you could jump in anywhere, but it's better if you go back and watch the older fortress,
01:44:46 at least as far back as Monster Killer, maybe even further.
01:44:49 I don't remember.
01:44:52 So I was just very fucking excited.
01:44:56 Just very fucking excited that Krugsmash is back to back to watchful eyes.
01:45:01 Cool.
01:45:03 Okay.
01:45:04 Yes.
01:45:05 Very cool.
01:45:07 Okay.
01:45:07 Next voicemail is called Tomgtomg how to resurrect the podcast.
01:45:14 Ah, thank God.
01:45:16 Three, two, one, go.
01:45:18 So first of all, the way the podcast is right now, it's not dead, of course.
01:45:23 There's still people watching it.
01:45:26 They call the volcano dormant when it's like low activity is to sleep for a while.
01:45:31 So I think that's why we should call the state the podcast is in.
01:45:34 Currently, it's dormant.
01:45:36 So the way that we fix this is to have another rag con because that always brings the spirits
01:45:43 up as a good rag con.
01:45:45 Like in the past, rag con has brought people who supposedly left the podcast back into the
01:45:52 fold.
01:45:52 Maybe not immediately, but like slowly.
01:45:55 You know, there was another rag con.
01:45:58 Plenty of people who have supposedly left the podcast would probably go to it anyways.
01:46:03 Right?
01:46:04 Yeah, like that's true.
01:46:06 I stopped the voicemail.
01:46:07 That's true, but we can't do it because we have things that must be
01:46:14 delivered on from the last one, which are actually being, believe it or not,
01:46:19 they are actually being produced.
01:46:21 It's definitely slower than we would have liked.
01:46:23 But yes, nothing has been like, aside from the stuff that we haven't started yet,
01:46:29 like the dojin.
01:46:30 Well, the stuff that we haven't started yet is not started because the other things that
01:46:35 have not been finished yet must be done first.
01:46:40 Does the dojin need anything to get done?
01:46:44 Well, we never really settled what exactly the dojin would be.
01:46:52 I had some ideas about what it would be.
01:46:54 My ideas, though, were that it should tie into the OVA and Road to Radcon.
01:47:02 And Digi has still not finished the final chapter of Road to Radcon,
01:47:07 despite me asking her several times to do so, despite you asking her several times to do so,
01:47:13 and her saying, yes, she'll do it, but she still hasn't done it yet.
01:47:16 So we can't do that because I think it should be a tie-in.
01:47:26 So there's that.
01:47:29 My idea is that it should be, well, whatever.
01:47:33 I've explained that enough.
01:47:36 At some point, there's only so many times you can just ask her to do it and wait.
01:47:47 Should I write it?
01:47:48 Should you write it at this point?
01:47:50 I don't know.
01:47:51 It feels wrong because I don't know what it was supposed to be.
01:47:56 It does feel wrong.
01:47:59 Well, okay, I have a few thoughts about this.
01:48:02 It does feel wrong because the Road to Radcon was like absolutely a Digi creation.
01:48:10 It would not have been, you know, I don't think anyone else could, like,
01:48:16 it wouldn't be the same if anyone else made it.
01:48:19 On the other hand, slightly mitigating that is the fact that now, like, two years later,
01:48:23 if, like, everything, is it two years?
01:48:25 I don't think it's two full years.
01:48:27 Almost a year later, almost a year.
01:48:30 Yeah.
01:48:30 Almost a year later.
01:48:32 I mean, after everything has happened, a lot has changed and, like, Road to Radcon 5
01:48:37 now will not be what it would have been, but I still think Digi should write it because,
01:48:45 I mean, I still think it's, it should be Digi that makes it.
01:48:49 If she won't do it, then I guess someone else will have to, even though that does seem completely wrong.
01:48:57 Right.
01:48:58 I mean, we should definitely make sure if we're going to do it that we tell her beforehand.
01:49:03 Sure.
01:49:03 Just in case she was gonna get around to it.
01:49:06 I don't know.
01:49:08 I have no doubt that she has every intention of eventually getting around to it, but, like,
01:49:14 eventually must be on a reasonable time frame.
01:49:18 And I know that sounds hypocritical considering how long it's been that, like,
01:49:22 the other stuff is still getting made, but I was saying, I was saying before that, like,
01:49:27 the OVA will not be an infinite amount of time away.
01:49:31 The OVA will be, like, coming, you know, probably in the medium to short, not short,
01:49:40 in the slightly longer than short, low, medium range future.
01:49:46 If you understand, that makes perfect sense.
01:49:49 And therefore, if we want, I would like to just have everything done before the OVA is done.
01:49:54 I would like the OVA to be, like, basically the last thing that comes out.
01:49:58 Yeah, yeah.
01:50:00 And with it, everything else that is associated.
01:50:02 And have that be, like, okay, it's done.
01:50:04 We deliver it on everything it's done.
01:50:06 And only then could we even consider a Radcon five?
01:50:10 Five, yeah.
01:50:11 Radcon five, I mean, even if we wanted to just do one right now, there is a pandemic still.
01:50:18 I would want to wait for that to, like, ease up a little bit more.
01:50:22 For sure.
01:50:23 I mean, I would prefer it if, like, we were all vaccinated by then.
01:50:27 Yes, that's going to take a while.
01:50:30 Because it's all like, well, for, it'll be a few, it'll be a few months at least.
01:50:34 Sure.
01:50:36 All the people that prioritize people with conditions are prioritized and they still
01:50:40 got to build, they still got to, like, create millions and millions of them.
01:50:43 The rollout plan in my area estimates that, like, the vaccination will be
01:50:50 available for the general public around April or May, which probably is an optimistic guess.
01:50:56 And I would assume that that's the earliest it would possibly be.
01:50:59 When you say general public, do you mean?
01:51:02 I mean, anyone.
01:51:05 You mean, like, no bees getting vaccinated yet?
01:51:08 No, I mean, I mean, they are being that, they're rolling it out, but it's for, like, only, like,
01:51:12 you know, right now, like, frontline workers and then, you know, like, be at risk and stuff.
01:51:16 And then eventually around April or May, it becomes, like, anyone can get it.
01:51:20 Sure.
01:51:21 Is the plan anyway.
01:51:23 So yeah, that's true.
01:51:25 Lol, I forgot about the pandemic.
01:51:29 Okay.
01:51:30 So about, yeah, the Rotoradcom thing is a little bit of a, of a bottleneck.
01:51:38 And we should, I fucking posted in the chat about it yesterday,
01:51:45 but whatever, we gotta, we gotta figure something out.
01:51:50 I really do think we should get, we should get cracking.
01:51:53 Yeah.
01:51:54 Okay.
01:51:55 Anyway, next voicemail.
01:51:57 Yep.
01:51:58 Is all right.
01:51:59 Next, next one.
01:52:00 Timmy Jimmy, Powder Game Pixel Limit.
01:52:03 Three, two, one, go.
01:52:06 I don't know if anybody still cares about this, but the guy who made Powder Game is like Japanese.
01:52:12 So his English interfaces are kind of terrible.
01:52:16 If you go open Powder Game and look down at the bottom right, there's a button that says Dot S,
01:52:21 and that is the Dot Limit of the simulator.
01:52:25 So if you click it, it cycles through so you can increase it.
01:52:28 There still is one, but like-
01:52:30 This must be why when I was playing Powder Game.
01:52:32 It's a lot more than, than the small one.
01:52:35 Stuff would just like stop appearing.
01:52:37 It can do even more crazy stuff with more, more, more pixels on the screen.
01:52:43 So, so now go play the game again in the middle of the podcast.
01:52:48 Now there's 20 more seconds of your voicemail left for you.
01:52:50 Genuinely, yes.
01:52:51 I love, love hearing about people just hear, hear them experiencing something,
01:52:57 being like, oh, that's cool, because I know it's cool.
01:53:00 And that's me, I did that.
01:53:02 I, I told you about the cool thing and that feels good.
01:53:05 So play the game again in the middle of the podcast.
01:53:07 Thank you.
01:53:08 Okay, nothing.
01:53:09 Cool.
01:53:10 Well, what was it?
01:53:11 Is the Dot S Dot L, does that mean large amount of dots?
01:53:17 He said Dot S.
01:53:18 Okay.
01:53:18 I clicked on it.
01:53:19 Oh, maybe yeah, it means dots.
01:53:21 Well, that's funny.
01:53:24 Well, you should put stuff in the game until you can't put any more
01:53:28 and then click that to change the limit and see if you can then put more stuff in.
01:53:35 Uh, I'm, I'm playing the game.
01:53:42 Hey, um, I'm, I, I'm, I gotta say, I gotta say, uh, so like these are all definitely, uh, Tommy
01:53:52 J. Again, these are, you know, Tom G, Timmy Jimmy.
01:53:55 The next one is terminal, germinal, then Thimble D, Jimble D, then Thinky Jinky,
01:53:59 to Bajuba, Thongjong, Tom Jump.
01:54:02 Oh, oh, I hadn't noticed.
01:54:03 So, yeah.
01:54:04 So, um, I mean, we literally told him not to do this in the last episode
01:54:09 and it's like he didn't listen.
01:54:11 So I'm, I mean, these aren't the worst, these aren't the worst voicemails,
01:54:19 but they're not great either.
01:54:20 And like, I don't know.
01:54:23 I don't know.
01:54:26 I'm gonna, I'm gonna start the next one.
01:54:28 I'll start the next one.
01:54:29 It's called FTL is Good.
01:54:31 Three, two, one, go.
01:54:33 Ben, you like roguelikes and roguelites, such as Stone Soup.
01:54:38 Uh, have you ever played FTL?
01:54:40 I know about FTL.
01:54:40 Faster than life.
01:54:41 I have not played FTL.
01:54:42 It's really fucking good.
01:54:44 It's like endless entertainment.
01:54:45 I heard it's good.
01:54:46 I can like, it's just simple enough that I could actually like play it in class because of this.
01:54:52 Okay, that's it.
01:54:52 No more.
01:54:53 Next one is called Thimble D, Jim, yep.
01:54:55 I've heard FTL is good.
01:54:57 I never played it.
01:54:58 Next one, Thimble D, Jimble, College Solutions.
01:55:00 Three, two, one, go.
01:55:03 I just want to add on an addendum to the college discussion as like a thing that you,
01:55:09 if you're in high school, or preferably about to start high school,
01:55:13 something you can do to fix this, like in your own life, you know,
01:55:19 avoid a lot of the averse effects.
01:55:22 Because so I only had to take about three, three gen ed courses in college.
01:55:31 And the reason why is because I took 10, 10 AP courses in high school.
01:55:38 And I got college credit.
01:55:40 Okay, that's it.
01:55:42 No more.
01:55:43 Yeah, what he's saying.
01:55:44 Yeah, you can take things.
01:55:45 You can take AP.
01:55:47 This is an American high school thing.
01:55:49 You can take AP classes in high school and they can,
01:55:53 you're, they can sometimes count for like college credit or you can,
01:55:57 you can, you can, um, what's the word like, um, qualify out of taking like certain gen ed
01:56:02 requirements, uh, because, you know, they'll count you have being like taken like,
01:56:07 you know, elementary, uh, you know, chemistry or physics or whatever.
01:56:10 If you do the AP class, uh, yep, it's a good idea.
01:56:15 Next one is called.
01:56:16 Thank you, Jinky.
01:56:17 More college shit.
01:56:19 They're all a minute 30, three, two, one go.
01:56:23 So I have some more clarifications about the school shit.
01:56:26 So Ben or whoever, uh, you've seen my resume.
01:56:30 No, perhaps you remember computer science.
01:56:33 No, I didn't read your resume.
01:56:34 Computer science is a very strange field because it's the sort of thing where, uh, where,
01:56:41 where theory is like constantly relevant to the actual practice of the, the, the field.
01:56:50 Like, you know, of course, theoretical physics, like modern cutting edge stuff.
01:56:55 I have stopped only occasionally.
01:56:57 Okay.
01:56:57 That's cool.
01:56:58 Uh, computer science sure is fascinating.
01:57:01 Uh, next one.
01:57:02 Tuba juba equal line B carrot parentheses.
01:57:08 This is me three, two, one go.
01:57:12 As I record this voicemail, I'm going to do it.
01:57:16 I finally, I think I've finally entered into the class of person that can afford to patron
01:57:22 other people because like I made money off of that fucking, well, not off of the game
01:57:28 stopping.
01:57:29 I made money off the doge coin thing that happened a little bit after that.
01:57:32 I sold it just the right time.
01:57:34 It was perfect.
01:57:36 I think I was supposed to like hold and ride the wave, but I would have not made as much
01:57:41 money if I did that.
01:57:42 And I don't think the Wall Street people, like how come Tommy J gets to make money off
01:57:48 doge, shorting the coin?
01:57:50 So I don't think I like, I was on the side of the bad people.
01:57:56 You know, I don't think I stopped them.
01:57:58 Doge coin is not bad.
01:58:00 Other people from fucking them like they deserve.
01:58:02 You know, anyways, I have money now.
01:58:05 I made a lot.
01:58:07 I think like I've finally entered into the class of person that can patron other people.
01:58:13 So of course I'm not going to patron the procrastinator podcast.
01:58:16 I'm going to patron Jeff so that I can see all of this hidden Jeff's content that people have
01:58:21 been fucking yapping their mouths about.
01:58:24 And I can't see any of it because I don't have any money, but I do have money now.
01:58:27 So I'm going to do it and I'll report back whether it was worth it or not.
01:58:33 You should patron me.
01:58:37 Gibb.
01:58:38 You might spend this podcast.
01:58:40 What Gibb, what?
01:58:43 I don't know if we're going to have to cut this or not.
01:58:45 I'm, I'm actually upset.
01:58:47 I'm, I'm honestly upset.
01:58:49 I'm genuinely offended and angry.
01:58:52 And I hate this person so much.
01:58:54 I hate Tommy J so fucking much.
01:58:58 I cannot fucking stand him.
01:58:59 Jesus Christ.
01:59:00 I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm seething.
01:59:02 I'm seething.
01:59:09 Do you want to let him know?
01:59:10 Do you want to keep this in?
01:59:13 What do you think?
01:59:14 I don't know.
01:59:16 What do you think we should do?
01:59:17 I don't know.
01:59:18 I don't know what to do.
01:59:18 I'm at a loss.
01:59:19 I'm at a complete loss.
01:59:23 Okay.
01:59:24 Next, next voicemail from Thong Jong.
01:59:27 Three, two, one, go.
01:59:29 Oh my God.
01:59:30 Everybody has always been saying,
01:59:32 oh, if you want to know what's going on with Jess,
01:59:34 just patron her.
01:59:35 But you can see the patron videos.
01:59:39 Uh, no, stop.
01:59:40 Nobody says that.
01:59:42 Nobody says that.
01:59:43 Nobody fucking gives a shit.
01:59:45 Nobody fucking gives a shit what Jess is doing.
01:59:47 Who fucking cares?
01:59:48 Fuck you.
01:59:49 Fuck you.
01:59:50 Oh my God.
01:59:52 Uh, that, I'm skipping the rest.
01:59:54 That's it.
01:59:54 We're going out on a sour note.
01:59:56 I don't want to give this person.
01:59:57 No, no more.
02:00:00 Tommy J.
02:00:01 I will never, ever, ever play another voicemail of yours.
02:00:05 Fuck you.
02:00:07 Go to hell.
02:00:08 All right.
02:00:08 Fuck off.
02:00:10 Fuck off.
02:00:12 I'm, I'm, I know I'm taking,
02:00:15 I know I'm taking this too seriously.
02:00:17 But you know what?
02:00:18 I'm, I'm valid.
02:00:20 I'm valid.
02:00:22 No, I'm with you.
02:00:23 He was just going on about whatever he wanted to talk about.
02:00:26 It wasn't a question.
02:00:27 It wasn't like, I have something to talk about on the
02:00:30 parochrasmators podcast.
02:00:31 It's just like, here's something I think about and want people to listen to.
02:00:35 Here is, here is the rub.
02:00:37 He's lapping as, as a member of, of the show.
02:00:40 Here is the rub, Tommy J.
02:00:42 I will never play another voicemail that has your name on it.
02:00:46 And if I recognize your voice, which I will, because I know what you sound like,
02:00:52 I will not play it.
02:00:53 And I will tell Ellie Azar to edit it out.
02:00:55 You will never hear yourself on the PCP ever again.
02:00:58 Do not make another voicemail.
02:01:00 If you do, you'll be wasting your time.
02:01:01 Fuck you.
02:01:02 All right.
02:01:03 That's it.
02:01:04 Next voicemail is called Homestuck Preservation Final.
02:01:09 Hopefully three, two, one, go.
02:01:13 Okay.
02:01:13 This is an addendum to the whole Homestuck Preservation problem.
02:01:17 The offline archive I previously mentioned does not fucking work.
02:01:21 Flash is dead and so is that archive.
02:01:23 Sorry for the confusion.
02:01:25 What you need to do is you need to go, you need to Google the unofficial Homestuck
02:01:29 Collection on Google.
02:01:30 And the first result should be bambosh.github.io.
02:01:35 And it's the unofficial Homestuck Collection.
02:01:37 Follow the fucking instructions.
02:01:38 You have to download an asset pack.
02:01:40 It is, in fact, the entire thing.
02:01:43 Now, when you start it up, it's, you go to the map because you're like,
02:01:46 oh man, I want to skip to my favorite part.
02:01:48 There's nothing there.
02:01:49 The reason that that is, is that there's a settings page
02:01:52 that enables a new reader function.
02:01:55 Okay.
02:01:55 You can disable that in the settings.
02:01:59 So you can have the entire thing, but like for new readers,
02:02:02 it like doesn't let you skip to later parts and spoil yourself,
02:02:05 which I think is interesting, but also shitty considering I've read the entire
02:02:09 thing and I just want to fucking see spades slick.
02:02:11 Anyway, have a good day.
02:02:14 Fuck that Homestuck archive I talked about earlier.
02:02:18 True.
02:02:18 I'm not having a good day, but thanks anyway.
02:02:21 Okay.
02:02:25 Okay.
02:02:26 I guess I have nothing else to say about that.
02:02:28 Yes.
02:02:29 It is just good that there is a Homestuck.
02:02:32 Yes.
02:02:32 It's good, it's good that there's a Homestuck.
02:02:36 Man, can you believe that we share a planet,
02:02:38 we share a planet with Homestuck.
02:02:41 Oh wait.
02:02:42 We live on the same earth.
02:02:43 The Hussie project came out.
02:02:46 Did you play it?
02:02:47 I bought it.
02:02:48 I haven't played it yet.
02:02:49 I meant to.
02:02:50 Okay.
02:02:52 Yeah, I haven't played it yet.
02:02:53 You can talk about that when we both played it.
02:02:56 I was, I'm so stupid.
02:02:58 I literally was gonna, but then it was like, oh, but noida though.
02:03:01 I could beat it again.
02:03:05 Okay.
02:03:06 Next one is called a plus one.
02:03:09 Three, two, one, go.
02:03:11 Also, it seems that I have something to show now, so I will.
02:03:15 Ilzon.me, that's my new website.
02:03:18 Please go check it out.
02:03:21 That's I-L-U-Z-O-N.me.
02:03:26 Yeah, that's it.
02:03:29 Wait, maybe he had a voicemail last week and he has posted this.
02:03:36 I don't know.
02:03:37 Before that episode came out or something.
02:03:41 It says five days ago.
02:03:42 Oh, I mean, I don't remember playing.
02:03:49 I don't remember whether we played a voicemail from him or not.
02:03:52 This, this is not like, why would he think that we would know
02:03:57 what the also is in regards to?
02:04:00 Maybe he, he probably can't see everything that happened in between.
02:04:04 I don't know.
02:04:06 But we've, but we've played all the, he would have had to,
02:04:12 if he left a voicemail about something,
02:04:14 it would have been more than five days ago.
02:04:17 So he would have said whatever he said and then at least five days,
02:04:21 probably more later, he called up the voicemail and said,
02:04:24 also, I have a website and here's what it is.
02:04:28 No.
02:04:29 Okay.
02:04:29 Next one is called plus two, three, two, one, go.
02:04:34 And what is going on on that website?
02:04:36 You ask why it's ego month thing done by me every day, all January,
02:04:45 all black history month, the shortest month.
02:04:51 Who is this?
02:04:52 Who is this person?
02:04:53 I think he may have been the guy giving comic recommendations at one point.
02:04:58 No, that guy's accent was like fucking un unbearably thick.
02:05:07 Uh, well, this is not, this is not that guy.
02:05:09 Maybe we'll see the guy who called us out.
02:05:12 It was on who, who are you?
02:05:13 Who the fuck are you?
02:05:15 Why are you?
02:05:15 What, what is this in regards to?
02:05:18 Fuck off.
02:05:19 Christ.
02:05:20 Next one is another Tommy J.
02:05:22 No.
02:05:22 Next one is after that is thousand lung man from Nate fuckers at michelkillers.com.
02:05:30 Three, two, one, go.
02:05:37 Oh, how I've waited for this moment.
02:05:41 Nice production value to see him here.
02:05:46 Wait, where is he?
02:05:49 Where is Nate?
02:05:53 I wanted to see him.
02:05:56 He was meant to be here.
02:05:58 Oh, true.
02:06:07 Here, we live in a doom timeline.
02:06:10 I really like this idea of a man with a thousand miles.
02:06:14 How much he means to me.
02:06:16 How much I want to fuck him.
02:06:19 I wish to fuck Nate.
02:06:22 I am with the league of Nate fuckers.
02:06:28 I like leaves me breathless.
02:06:40 The idea of like a like a weird creepy like lung based monstrosity is pretty cool.
02:06:49 I don't know why he has so many lungs.
02:06:53 Never.
02:06:54 Oh God, I'm going to say it wrong.
02:06:56 You ever heard of a Hecaton Kyrie's?
02:06:59 Nope.
02:07:01 It is a Greek monster.
02:07:04 It's from like mythology, I guess.
02:07:07 I think they like were like from around like the time of the Titans,
02:07:11 like before the gods took over.
02:07:14 They were like the name means hundred handed ones.
02:07:17 And they are just like giant fucking clusters of a hundred arms that will grab you.
02:07:24 Do you like the cluster from Steven Universe?
02:07:32 Yeah, yeah, actually.
02:07:33 Yeah, pretty much.
02:07:36 They're not that big, though.
02:07:37 I mean, it's only a hundred.
02:07:39 It's only a hundred.
02:07:41 Give that's that's just ridiculous.
02:07:43 It's just ridiculous.
02:07:48 All right, pretty good.
02:07:49 Next one is called Seeking Goss.
02:07:52 Three, two, one, go.
02:07:57 Hey, I just want to be real quick.
02:07:58 I don't need, you know, any torque and hog off or anything.
02:08:00 I was just wondering, where do I find what happened between Digi and May?
02:08:06 I don't need you guys to talk about it on the show.
02:08:08 I just want to know where to go to hear her talk about it.
02:08:13 I mean, she she made a video.
02:08:15 May made a video, I think.
02:08:17 I don't know if Digi ever talked about it, probably not.
02:08:21 I don't think so.
02:08:23 I mean, if you're seeking goss, there are places to go.
02:08:27 He specifically said, I want to hear her talk about it.
02:08:30 And she made a video.
02:08:33 Oh, that's right.
02:08:34 Yeah, I guess he could have met either of them.
02:08:37 Well, Digi, yeah, I don't think Digi ever did talk anywhere.
02:08:46 So I don't know.
02:08:49 Honestly, it's been a while.
02:08:50 I forgot the specifics.
02:08:52 They broke up.
02:08:53 It's as much as I can remember, really.
02:08:56 There was definitely stuff that happened.
02:08:59 There is, I mean, yeah, sites.
02:09:03 I wouldn't recommend going to like, what was it called?
02:09:09 The stupid place where the idiots go.
02:09:12 Kiwi farms?
02:09:13 Yeah.
02:09:14 I think a lot of people there would have been talking about it.
02:09:17 If you really want to know.
02:09:18 But I don't know whether any of that is true.
02:09:21 Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of speculation there.
02:09:25 A lot of speculation and a lot of like, oh, I bet I know what happened.
02:09:29 Yeah, I love that.
02:09:32 If you want, yeah, I don't think Digi ever really made a thing out of it.
02:09:36 So I don't know.
02:09:37 Sorry.
02:09:39 Sorry.
02:09:41 Unless she did and I'm forgetting, but I don't think I am.
02:09:44 Okay.
02:09:45 Good question, lol.
02:09:47 But if you want, I mean, if you want the short, I mean, I don't know.
02:09:52 I mean, I could just say what happened, but like, is it worth it?
02:09:57 I mean, I honestly forget.
02:09:59 Well, I mean, they, there was the, you know, there's a little publicly available information,
02:10:07 you know, they said they had the break in that someone broke into their house or something or
02:10:16 something.
02:10:16 That one's got a big asterisk and that one's got to get big asterisk and an or something on it,
02:10:20 because I actually don't know what the fuck that was.
02:10:24 And then, and then they broke up and then May went to go be a fucking right wing shithead
02:10:32 with Ethan Ralph Lamal.
02:10:35 And now she's a, you know, now she's insane.
02:10:39 Yeah.
02:10:40 She was always insane.
02:10:42 True.
02:10:42 She was always.
02:10:42 Well, I mean, I didn't know I had no idea.
02:10:45 She was always dumb as fuck, but now she's free.
02:10:47 Now she's free to be as dumb as she likes and embarrass herself in whatever way she chooses.
02:10:56 Lamal.
02:10:58 Cool.
02:10:59 And I think that's basically it.
02:11:01 That's the gist of it.
02:11:04 Next one is called Alaskan Weeb 321 Go.
02:11:10 So I'm going through things, not a little bit behind, but I just know some got to the episode
02:11:16 where you guys were answering the voicemail about accidents and everyone thinks it's about
02:11:20 southern accidents.
02:11:21 So I haven't been down here in the south too long, but I've noticed that there are
02:11:25 roughly speaking about three kinds of accidents that you run into.
02:11:28 You kind of run into the Morpheus Accent, which is very long, slow and raw.
02:11:34 You can, uh, it's more common among men than among women, but it's very slow and raw.
02:11:40 Then you got more of your, uh, your Bible Belt Accent.
02:11:45 Those ones are a lot more nasal, uh, which my anger is often used to refer to it.
02:11:50 Pretty common.
02:11:51 Then of course you got shield, Bailey Accent, which ain't really from the, uh,
02:11:55 from the south.
02:11:55 It's a lot more from like the Appalachian, Gold Belt, but it was loved in with them anyways.
02:12:02 And second of all, Palin's not from Alaska.
02:12:04 She's from fucking Idaho.
02:12:05 Everyone up here fucking hates her.
02:12:08 Fuck Sarah Palin.
02:12:09 Sarah Palin.
02:12:12 Uh, uh, oh yeah.
02:12:15 I didn't know she was from Idaho.
02:12:17 I know her as the Alaskan, so that's, that's new.
02:12:21 Um, there's, yeah, there's, there's different, I know there are a bunch of different kinds
02:12:25 of southern accents, um, and I've heard people do a bunch of different ones.
02:12:30 And when I hear them, I can be like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, they're totally different.
02:12:34 But like, I couldn't actually identify for you which one is which in, in the wild.
02:12:41 Uh, yeah, it's true.
02:12:44 It's true.
02:12:45 It's all true.
02:12:46 It's true that people do be talking different sometimes.
02:12:49 People do be talking different sometimes.
02:12:52 That, and that's no joke, lol.
02:12:56 Uh, speaking of which, the next one is called Funny Joke.
02:13:00 Warning, not a funny joke.
02:13:03 Three, two, one, go.
02:13:06 Hey gamers, no more funny jokes for me.
02:13:08 I'm all out of them, but that did get me thinking.
02:13:12 What's the funniest thing that you think you've ever done?
02:13:16 That I've ever done.
02:13:18 Be born.
02:13:20 The funniest, I mean funny in like deliberately funny or funny in like a laugh at me kind of way.
02:13:27 Um, I don't know.
02:13:32 I mean, I dress like a freaking freak in high school.
02:13:37 I wore, I wore suits all the time and I had this like weird, like this giant like creaky
02:13:42 red leather coat that I would wear all the time.
02:13:45 Uh, just the way that I, just the way that I looked in high school was probably the
02:13:48 funniest thing I ever did.
02:13:49 Honestly, if I'm, if I'm being honest, um, anything else?
02:13:53 I, I can't think of like, when I was young,
02:13:57 I was becoming a pony, becoming a pony tuber was a pretty funny thing to do.
02:14:01 Actually, I guess that is funny.
02:14:03 That might be it.
02:14:04 Actually, an ironic pony analyst.
02:14:07 Yeah, I was a little, I was a little ironic.
02:14:11 Uh, I was less ironic, I think.
02:14:13 I just liked, I just liked thinking about it and it was like a big thing at the time.
02:14:18 Um, when I was young, I wasn't like into a, like a goth or or emo or any sort of
02:14:25 weird thing that you look at it back in cringe,
02:14:28 which is also almost more cringy because it's not funny.
02:14:32 It's just like you were just quiet and did as you were told.
02:14:36 And that's the cringiest possible thing, but it's not a funny cringy thing.
02:14:40 So yeah, I guess brony analysis is probably the best thing I've done.
02:14:43 Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's a winner.
02:14:45 That's the winner.
02:14:47 Uh, um, okay.
02:14:49 Next one.
02:14:49 Oh my God.
02:14:50 Cringus bingus bonus episode.
02:14:55 Three, two, one, go.
02:14:57 Hey guys, it's Kingie's penis.
02:14:59 Here we go.
02:15:00 I'm just calling because you wanted me, I listened to the last episode and you wanted
02:15:06 me to talk about my feelings on pain pizza's art style.
02:15:11 Yes, please.
02:15:11 I remember watching some pain pizza videos back when I was in high school.
02:15:16 And I liked those videos.
02:15:17 They were fun.
02:15:18 I watched the pain in stocking video.
02:15:20 I watched, uh, that's really the only one I remember off the top of my head.
02:15:24 But, um, he did a bunch of cool videos about cartoons and I liked them.
02:15:29 They were good.
02:15:29 I think his art style is okay.
02:15:31 It's like very 2000s, like mid 2000s.
02:15:34 It's like 2000s, but like a shitty version of it.
02:15:37 It's not really my thing.
02:15:38 But if you like it, then, uh, then I guess that's okay.
02:15:43 What I hate about it is like, I see what he's going for.
02:15:45 I think that I can get a bonus cring this week.
02:15:49 A thing that I cringed that was, uh, was, uh, Tommy Jay, uh, that Tommy Jay guy.
02:15:56 If you're listening to this, um, you don't need to send in like a billion voicemails.
02:16:02 Just, they just think of one really good one every week.
02:16:05 Yeah.
02:16:05 Like Kringus Fingusy.
02:16:07 Tommy Jay needs to be more like Kringus Fingus.
02:16:09 We all do.
02:16:10 That's my advice.
02:16:11 Kringus Fingus signing off.
02:16:12 Thank you.
02:16:13 Kringus Fingus.
02:16:15 Voice mail?
02:16:16 Voice mail.
02:16:17 Pizza Party Podcast.
02:16:20 I think he's already in the voice mail.
02:16:23 Well I wish, I wish I could put, if I could put him in there again, I would.
02:16:28 Um, Um, Ben, uh, I think you missed, uh, Cluster Punk Kitchen right here.
02:16:34 Oh, I did.
02:16:35 I skipped it.
02:16:36 Cause it was, it was, it had the, it was just color different cause it was played.
02:16:40 Okay.
02:16:40 I'll play it, I'll play it in a sec.
02:16:41 But, um, okay.
02:16:43 I was a little harsh before when I said I can see what he's doing. He's failing
02:16:46 He doesn't always fail like I said last time. I think sometimes his art is like a passable
02:16:53 Like okay. Yeah, it's that like cartoon network like, you know
02:16:58 Super flat
02:17:00 Style sometimes it's like it's that and I get it and it's okay and sometimes it's that but like bad and ugly and it looks terrible
02:17:08 So it's not like I don't get
02:17:12 It's not like I don't get what he thinks the appeal of his art is I just think that it fails to be
02:17:18 Appealing in that way a lot of the time. Do you think it like it comes across as half finished like a first draft
02:17:26 Something sloppy. Yeah. Yeah sloppy some a lot of the time
02:17:32 Actually, I actually to be fair
02:17:34 I actually really like the drawing of me that he did when I was on their show like that's an example
02:17:40 I think when his style works and it's fine
02:17:44 Because I was in it. Well, I mean, yeah, but it's a good drawing in my party
02:17:51 cast Ben St
02:17:56 With yeah PCP's Ben St. Oh
02:18:00 Yeah, yeah, I remember that that was a pretty good
02:18:04 Yeah, it looks about like it feels good, but then I don't know
02:18:08 He's a bunch of those images in his pitch. We're just like this is this is garbage. This dog shit. This is like
02:18:16 I
02:18:18 Can see what you're trying to do and it's like half working

02:22:29 That's what a bastardization is

02:24:53 The triumvirate of jack's jesters and jokers was somewhat caught on a wares. Thus. I was all they could sin
02:25:00 I was airdropped onto the capital building in the fires of uprising and my goal was
02:25:04 Simba's
02:25:06 Placing a dude live iris into the u.s. Network that would disrupt all the attempts at policy making with mark hamill as the joker
02:25:15 laughing highly base-boosted
02:25:17 Unfortunately, the plan hit a snag near immediately as I was
02:25:21 Shorten the face and then rushed to a hospital where I was later arrested with a previously existing warrant out for my arrest
02:25:29 I've been busy essentially clawing my way out of the intense minimum security prison
02:25:34 They left me to rot in after all this time
02:25:37 I've finally been able to check in with my base to report my failure

02:31:35 With something he he did enter the rfck. He entered the crafts contest, but he entered it with um
02:31:41 Screenshots of the rowdy rough house. Oh, that's he's been building. He was building the rowdy rough house by the way in the
02:31:49 PCP minecraft server and he also and actually this is a good time to mention
02:31:53 He said that he's gonna make the server free to all rfck people
02:31:59 Which I didn't know he had the authority to do that, but I guess what do I know?
02:32:04 Uh, it is what it is and he said he's gonna do it. So he's probably gonna do it
02:32:08 Uh, so if you're an rfck person and you want to see the full scale, uh, mlaca calm that's being built
02:32:16 Uh, I mean just fucking PCP minecraft server is the place to to do it

02:33:35 Hey, uh, I just wanted to call in and say that the uh, dumb ass who called on last week rambling about limited liability corporations
02:33:42 I think that was tommy j by uh, you know giant corporations
02:33:47 To dodge liability for things that's not how it works limited liability corporations are not like
02:33:53 A fucking rank of package that uh, larger corporations get it's like a completely separate kind of entity
02:34:00 Uh used by sole proprietor proprietorships and uh
02:34:05 Like small partnerships between a couple people to uh, you know have a separate kind of uh
02:34:12 Safe area for their assets of the company and their own personal assets
02:34:18 So that if some asshole decides to sue them or they make a mistake
02:34:22 They they're not going to get completely blown out of the fucking water with a single lawsuit and die horribly in the gutter
02:34:29 Uh, I mean thanks and whoever the guy is go fuck yourself. You're an idiot. That's that's tommy j and I completely agree. Um the uh
02:34:38 Yeah, I don't really understand a lot about it

02:34:48 Starting up a little fucking like rinky dink operation

02:34:56 Little shit stain companies. I think I don't know. I don't actually know how it works

02:43:37 He can't defend him and michelle can't defend against all that power
02:43:42 um
02:43:43 Okay, next one is cross emplemon new bad old good three two one go
02:43:51 Someone touched on how they're phasing out of being a fan of emplemon and I couldn't agree more
02:43:56 What emplemon used to do particularly well and what I think most people came to his channel for was his ability to create a
02:44:02 Long-form narrative about an obscure topic
02:44:05 Basically, he used to tell stories and what made him so good at this was his dedication to finding every relevant detail and skill
02:44:12 In creating a coherent theme out of the puzzle pieces that he digs up
02:44:15 This is apparent in his connection to crab mentality in the hungry box video the supposed curse that dale urnhart had on the
02:44:22 Daytona 500 track and the connection he draws between himself and leafy is here
02:44:26 On the other hand his recent videos completely lack a long-form story and or details that come together to make the whole package
02:44:33 Feel cohesive his video about the thing did have all those themes and messages
02:44:37 But it was really more so picking apart this one movie and so it felt more like a standard video essay
02:44:43 His fruit of the loom video was literally just him describing the mandela effect and acting like he was breaking new unexplored ground in
02:44:50 Philosophy and sympathy for the villain has nothing connecting the media properties
02:44:54 He discusses except they have good antagonists making the whole video feel painfully surface level
02:45:00 It did at least get me to watch whiplash though, which was amazing
02:45:05 Yeah, I feel that analysis. That was that was a pretty good. That was a pretty good
02:45:11 I feel like I completely understand now
02:45:14 Yeah, definitely the story aspect is is lacking at least
02:45:17 I I have never
02:45:20 I have never watched any emp lemon. I mean if that sounds like really cool content
02:45:25 um, it sounds kind of like what wang does I guess but like
02:45:29 Better, I don't know
02:45:31 Do you know wang that I
02:45:34 Oh, wang is another guy. He makes um, you know, he'll make like a
02:45:38 Sort of like a down the rabbit hole kind of thing
02:45:39 But like shorter and he'll just like explain like, you know, some weird story about like, you know, some guy who
02:45:47 Was misunderstood on the internet or some like artifact that was lost and what what happened to it or whatever
02:45:52 Or um, you know stuff like that. Um
02:45:56 Yeah
02:45:57 yeah, the
02:45:58 it's like, um, the
02:46:01 The jump between talking about
02:46:04 Like things that you have a
02:46:06 Like a passion for and then just making videos because you are a youtuber now
02:46:10 I feel like that's the stage employment is at the is at the moment
02:46:13 All these things that you talked about before were like he already was into them and like
02:46:20 The villain is like everyone knows what a villain is and it's it wasn't very
02:46:25 Interesting it was just sort of like here's some I don't know
02:46:28 Yeah, good and good voice mail. Good voicemail. Thanks cross. Thanks for thanks for breaking it down for me
02:46:35 Uh
02:46:36 Next voicemail is called one weird trick to learn Japanese quick not clickbait
02:46:42 Three two one go
02:46:45 Hey guys, I'm many weeks behind on the podcast
02:46:48 But when tom was talking about learning Japanese, I thought I could give some advice
02:46:51 So the best way to learn Japanese on your own is using this method on the site called refold.la
02:46:57 The gist is that the best way to learn a language is not by studying textbooks or trying to become conversational quick
02:47:02 But instead by immersion in the language. That's right. I'm talking watching anime dramas reading manga
02:47:08 All those people who say you can't learn Japanese by watching anime are dead fucking wrong
02:47:12 I've been learning kanji reading manga and watching anime
02:47:15 I'll be it with Japanese subtitles for like six months now and I can actually understand quite a bit of the dialogue
02:47:21 You could totally do the same thing for watching tokusatsu and kaiju movies and shows
02:47:25 The best part is that it's free wanikani costs like 200 dollars for lifetime membership and honestly
02:47:30 I don't think it works very well ganky textbooks fucking waste of your time
02:47:34 You're not gonna learn Japanese by reading a textbook and Japanese classes like during kovid fucking forget about it did
02:47:40 So unfortunately, it's not one weird tip to learn the language instantly
02:47:43 It does take some time
02:47:44 But it's worked pretty well for me and it's designed to get you experiencing content in the native language very early on
02:47:50 Give it a try and uh, let me know guys. Love the podcast. Thanks. Thank you. Um wait, so
02:47:57 Is there like some more to it or is the advice just like just watch anime and you'll learn Japanese
02:48:02 He said a website and
02:48:04 Yeah
02:48:06 I
02:48:11 Might have I might have misheard
02:48:15 Refold no, yeah refold dot la the roadmap to true fluency. What is this?
02:48:22 It's a step-by-step guide for learning any language from scratch
02:48:25 We explain exactly how to combine media strategic study and educational technologies to achieve high level language fluency faster than any other method in the world
02:48:33 Well, okay, so it's more than just it's more than just watching anime or reading. Okay, so yeah
02:48:39 I guess this is like instead of just like blindly watching anime you can have like a more of a
02:48:46 Uh a goal oriented approach to it
02:48:49 Okay
02:48:51 Okay, uh, I mean I I would believe that it does
02:48:56 Without knowing like exactly what the methodology of this place is I could believe that it would work
02:49:01 but like as long as you are like
02:49:04 You would need like a certain basic understanding
02:49:07 You would need to understand some a little bit of basic Japanese and like sentence structure and stuff
02:49:13 And then, you know, if you're watching it and it you know, it would probably be really tedious at first
02:49:18 You you would have to be looking up words, right? Like as you
02:49:22 Like as you watch and like you encounter stuff you've never seen before like you're not just gonna learn it just from seeing it
02:49:28 You'd have to like stop it and be like, okay, what does that mean?
02:49:31 You go look it up
02:49:33 And then you're like, okay now I know and then you come back to it and now you know and and you
02:49:38 Go like that, right?
02:49:39 Like it's not just watch it
02:49:42 uh
02:49:45 Develop basic established skills tools and habits for immersion learning and then you develop basic comprehension in a narrow
02:49:51 Slice and then you convert your required language to speaking ability stage four coming soon
02:49:56 Stage state the stage is stage zero refold philosophy stage one lay the foundation stage two build comprehension stage three
02:50:04 Learn to speak stage four coming soon
02:50:07 What could it be
02:50:10 Learn to read. I don't know but yeah, that sounds interesting
02:50:13 I'm not neat. Maybe I could do it with something but it's is it just about japan? No, it's a language any language
02:50:19 Did you did you quit learning arabic?
02:50:21 No, I I well I did quit as in that. I'm not currently doing anything about it
02:50:28 Um, but yeah, I could I kind of want to continue
02:50:33 Yeah, because it's it's a very cool
02:50:35 Script to to like to be able to write in that would be cool. I think
02:50:42 I mean it looks pretty cool. It does
02:50:45 truly
02:50:47 uh
02:50:48 Well, that was the last that was the last voicemail and we are budding up against the three hour limit
02:50:53 Eleazar says that we can't go over three hours because it breaks his computer
02:50:58 lame
02:51:02 Yeah, so we should cut it off here. We should wrap up uh patreon.com slash the procrastinators for bonus episodes now

02:51:40 Uh
02:51:43 That's I asked him no consent necessary. Oh, yeah, you're right. No, I didn't ask him and that's makes it better
02:51:52 Um, I paid Michelle five dollars to look the other way
02:51:58 It's no problem
02:52:00 Okay, uh, it sends us a voicemail to speakpipe.com slash pcp voicemail unless you're tommy j in which case don't do that
