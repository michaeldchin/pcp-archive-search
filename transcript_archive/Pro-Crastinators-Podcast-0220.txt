00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:09 Uh, I'm sorry darling, I'm listening to the PCP right now. It's so interesting. It's so
00:00:16 arousing. It's so exciting. It's so- what's- fuck how does it go? It's so something. Haven't
00:00:23 heard that song in a while. Hey, shout outs to Pro Sasuke for that tune. That was you right?
00:00:32 Oh god, I'm almost certain. Anyway, uh, welcome to the pro solo Bencast. It's here guys. It's
00:00:44 here. The day has arrived. The day has arrived. I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I own the road.
00:00:51 I can do whatever I want. And no one can stop me. I'm here to say thanks for listening.
00:01:00 And if this excites you, if the thought of the solo Bencast is titillating for you, as it should be,
00:01:08 you can get more on patreon.com slash ben saint where I do one of these every month just about
00:01:14 me and myself. What's going on? So, hmm, I don't have a plan. I never come into the
00:01:19 PCP with a plan. So what am I going to talk about? Let me talk about what's been going on with me.
00:01:23 Just very briefly, um, Vapors 2. It's coming out. It's getting printed. It's in the process right
00:01:30 now. Very exciting. Fulfillment shall begin. RFCK, Endless War, just got a big update. I wasn't
00:01:38 really involved in making it. I'm not much on the coding side of things anymore, hardly at all really.
00:01:43 But the pins, the pin kickstarter, those are also in production, entering the final stages. I should
00:01:48 have the samples of all the pin designs tomorrow. That's what UPS tells me. Very exciting. Uh,
00:01:54 that's great. That's cool and all. Good shit going on. Um, but enough about that. Let's talk about
00:02:03 the absolute state of the PCP. Um, just yesterday or was it the day before? I don't remember.
00:02:11 They all blur together. There was some Twitter shit. I went on Twitter. I went on the Procrastinator's
00:02:17 account and I said, it's, it's maybe time. This was, Tom had said that like, we need to start
00:02:24 thinking about what if the videos don't come back? And yeah, I agree. It's starting to seem like maybe
00:02:30 they won't. Um, YouTube keeps emailing us back. Whenever Nate sends an email, we get an email
00:02:37 back saying, thanks for reaching out. Thanks for your patience. There's still no update. We're working
00:02:43 on it. Um, meanwhile, like, you know, my, my close personal friend, Maryweather, who this is not
00:02:52 anything against him, I'm just using it as an example because I happen to notice that he had a,
00:02:56 a, a video get, uh, you know, falsely copyright flagged and it got taken down. He said so to
00:03:03 Team YouTube on Twitter and he got a response within like a day and his video went back up.
00:03:09 Hmm. Could it be that he has 10 times as many followers on Twitter? Could it be that he has
00:03:15 10 times as many YouTube subscribers? Hmm. Probably not. I don't see any correlation there.
00:03:21 And I certainly don't think that correlation implies causation. Heavens, heaven forbids
00:03:28 to Betsy. Um, so, you know, they, they're just God, they, I'm gonna, I'm gonna look at the fucking
00:03:35 Twitter because I'm so mad. I'll just tell you what happens. If you don't, if you don't look at
00:03:39 Twitter, that's fine. Um, I'll, I'll give you the blow by blow. Um, because this is infuriating.
00:03:46 Uh, you know, I said, um, you know, email us if you have the streams, right? At this point,
00:03:52 it's like, okay, we got to think about, are we, do we have to reupload? Um, if anyone has, I know
00:03:57 at least some of the streams were saved by, by one or two people. These were the people who,
00:04:02 they contacted us during Radcom when we thought we lost the streams and they had saved them.
00:04:06 So somebody has them saved, at least some of them. Some of them could be lost forever. I don't know.
00:04:12 Um, but at least some of them have been saved somewhere. So I sit in the tweet like, uh,
00:04:17 our content's gone. YouTube's really being sluggish. Email us at the procrastinators mail
00:04:23 at gmail.com. If you would be so kind, if you have a copy and can provide it with us for a
00:04:29 potential reupload in the future and fuck in team YouTube. Thanks for the follow-up. We're
00:04:36 still working on your case. We understand that this can be very frustrating, but rest assured that
00:04:40 we're doing our best to recover the deleted content. Appreciate your patience in the meantime.
00:04:45 Okay. Thanks for that, I guess. And then follow-up. We also recommend deleting your previous tweet
00:04:52 as it contains your personal info, email address. This is so that you can restore your privacy.
00:04:57 So you can send secure your privacy and security at all times. Hope this helps. Oh yeah, team
00:05:03 YouTube. That helps a lot. That's big. That's, that's a, that's doing a lot for me right now.
00:05:08 And I really appreciate it. I totally didn't think that gosh, if I said the email, someone might find
00:05:14 our email. And then who knows what could happen. Thank you. I'm sure you don't just want us to
00:05:20 delete the tweet because it's embarrassing that you made a fucking clerical error or, or a deliberate
00:05:25 decision, maybe, at this point, who knows, to just fucking destroy our content for no reason
00:05:31 and not even explain why. You know, it couldn't be that you just don't want us saying that on
00:05:36 Twitter. No. I'm very mad. I'm very mad about this PCP situation. That's it. I, what, you know, it
00:05:49 must be the moon. It must be those damn witches that cursed the moon. I don't know if you've seen
00:05:56 today. This is a trending thing on Twitter. Apparently someone says that some, some witches
00:06:00 did a blood hex on the moon and now it's bad. I don't know. I hadn't actually read the original
00:06:07 article, but I believe it. You know, I don't know the evidence, but I buy the premise that the moon
00:06:12 is cursed and we're all feeling the consequences. It just seems, it just seems, it just seems plausible.
00:06:19 You know, it just seems like something that it feels true is what I'm saying.
00:06:24 Oh, man. What else thing to update about the fucking procrastinator podcast?
00:06:33 You know, this, this shit is all happening. This content deletion has occurred. We're uploading
00:06:39 on the website. If you're listening to that on the website, hey, good job. You found me.
00:06:44 And, but we're still, we are still making some progress on the, on the rad con stuff that we
00:06:51 didn't deliver on yet, like the, the OVA and stuff. We are, we are chugging along that we've made a
00:06:56 little more headway on that. It'll, you know, when we'll be done. I don't know, but it's gonna get,
00:07:02 it's, it's getting there. It's, it's progressing. Oh man. I don't know. It's the solo Ben cast. And
00:07:13 you know, you've all given me a very easy out. This time, let me just, uh, the pro you've all
00:07:21 given me an easy out because I have been less censurious, censorious, um, with, with voicemails.
00:07:31 I think people are liking it. I think people are liking it. I'll play anything. I'll do anything.
00:07:36 I'm crazy. Uh, I mean, I'm Antifa. Um,
00:07:42 so I've been getting a lot more voicemails, so maybe I'll just jump into voicemails and see
00:07:45 how long that, that takes me. By the way, that guy, um, that guy who made the don't support PCP
00:07:53 or Digi Bro because Ben is Antifa and Digi is a quote unquote degenerate. Uh, that guy
00:07:59 privated the video. However, I did have the foresight to save a copy. I have a copy of that
00:08:08 video saved. And I think I might, I'm, I'll, I'll, I'll ask around and see if anyone else,
00:08:14 if there's a problem, if I do this, I think this should be fine, but I might re upload the video
00:08:18 just to Patreon, just as like, if you're a patron and you miss that video and you want to hear
00:08:24 all the reasons why, you know, the PCP hates America. I might put make that
00:08:31 just a little patron bonus exclusive thing since, since, since our, our friend has decided to redact
00:08:39 it publicly. Um, but you know, you put it, he put it, he put it out there and you know, he said it,
00:08:43 you know, people saw it. Um, anyway, so I might do that. Patreon.com slash the procrastinators.
00:08:53 Uh, but let's jump into voicemails and just see where the night, where the, where that leads.
00:08:59 Um, the first one is a hip hop is bad. You guys were talking about Kanye being the,
00:09:06 like running for president and shit. And, uh, you were mentioned the statement from a guy who said
00:09:12 that like, uh, hip hop sucks because they all just brag about stuff. And, um, yeah, bragging
00:09:19 in raps is like bad, but like the reverse is good because like I saw this other quote. I, uh,
00:09:29 it was like rap stopped being good when they stopped rapping about being poor and started
00:09:33 rapping about being rich. And, uh, I feel like that is actually true. And the rap that is about
00:09:40 like being vulnerable emotionally or financially or just in any way is better. And then like rap
00:09:47 where they're talking about how great they are and how they have money and bitches and all that
00:09:52 shit like that. Um, and that kind of just applies to any music. Like if you're, you know, talking
00:09:58 yourself up, it's kind of cringe, but if you're like, you know, letting you open in the doors to
00:10:04 your heart and shit, that's, that's epic and based every single time, even like all the music, you
00:10:11 know, right, right on. Um, I think, yeah, I don't, I'm like, I can understand the appeal and yeah,
00:10:21 not just rap anything, anything that any piece of media or whatever that is like bragging about
00:10:25 your success, bragging about how rich you are. It's like, okay, seems like the base appeal of that
00:10:32 would be like other rich people would like that. Cause like, yeah, I can relate to it. Like who's
00:10:37 going to, like no one's going to relate to that except other rich people or people who, or maybe
00:10:41 just people who overestimate their own success, right? Those are two things, but like there's
00:10:46 more poor people than rich people. Um, so I don't know. It's just based on the numbers game. I don't
00:10:53 get it, but apparently I'm wrong because people do seem to like rag raps. That's people don't
00:11:00 generally have a problem with it. As a fucking communist, uh, you know, I'm just inclined to be
00:11:07 like, hmm, wealth doesn't seem like a thing to be bragging about. If anything, I feel like you
00:11:12 should be embarrassed of it because you're hoarding resources and that's bad. Um, but I mean, obviously
00:11:18 not everyone feels that way. So yeah, uh, the, the, the, the quote, I remember quoting, I think
00:11:25 was Benjamin Dixon, he wasn't saying like bragging, rapping is bad. He was just saying that like the
00:11:30 rap culture celebrates capitalism and monetary accumulation, which seems from an outsider's
00:11:38 respect, as someone who doesn't, isn't into music at all, from an outsider's perspective,
00:11:42 that feels true. Um, but yeah, uh, good point. Next one is from stop recording.
00:11:51 Please stop recording unless you have at least four people on, because it's just, the podcast is
00:11:58 only wasting my time now with just two hour episodes that are shit. Um, like make two hour
00:12:05 episodes that waste my time and are funny again. Stop making shit. Okay. You dumb, you dumb motherfucker.
00:12:13 Okay. Listen, if you don't like, if you don't like episodes that have fewer people on them,
00:12:22 I guess that's fine. That's valid and you're entitled to your opinion. But why, like what,
00:12:29 what would you gain? What would you gain if we decided no, no, no, anything that doesn't have,
00:12:35 let's say four people on it shouldn't exist. We won't make it. What's the benefit? I, why? Like,
00:12:43 I could under, I could, if you, I don't see what's inherently worse about something that has, like,
00:12:48 here I am on the Ben Solo cast, like obviously I have a vested interest in this concept, right?
00:12:53 I don't see what is inherently worse about it, about having fewer people. I could understand
00:12:59 that you're having a preference, maybe it tends to be lower energy, or maybe it's just less likely
00:13:03 that, you know, your favorite guy or whatever is going to be on it. Fair enough. Why would we stop?
00:13:09 Why would we stop? I don't get it. You haven't explained it to me. You haven't convinced me.
00:13:15 Owned. Next one is from Thank You, Nate.
00:13:21 This message is from Nate. I saw your high school, the dead video recently, and it inspired me to
00:13:25 make a big change in my life. For years, I've been trying to win the affection of this girl by
00:13:29 trying to communicate that I need her, trying to appeal to the fact that she's my friend and she
00:13:34 cares about me to get her to be with me. That doesn't work, lads. You have to do the opposite.
00:13:39 It comes down to your dignity or your crush. Pick your dignity every time. That doesn't mean
00:13:44 never admit you're wrong. Just only do it when you actually think you are wrong. Even if that
00:13:48 trade-off works, you do not want to be one of those guys that's married to a woman that doesn't
00:13:52 respect him. You have to be okay without a woman for her to respect you. The thing I always got
00:13:57 caught up in was that I'd never met anyone who I wanted to spend my life with, like this girl,
00:14:02 and I don't think I ever will. But that doesn't matter because you don't actually need to be
00:14:06 with them. You need to work for something that you care about so much. Then even if it's all
00:14:10 you have, all alone, you'll be okay. Maybe this girl will come back to me someday or maybe I will
00:14:15 be alone. But if that happens, I will be okay. Thank you, Nate. You were close. You swerved a
00:14:26 little at the very end there. Surely, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume
00:14:33 that surely, in hindsight, you can see that maybe this girl will come back to me or maybe I'll be
00:14:40 alone is kind of the wrong lesson. If you don't, like you said, you don't need anyone. You can be
00:14:49 self-sufficient. You can be happy alone. That's called valuing yourself, having, I don't know,
00:14:56 dignity or whatever. It's a component of that, right? If you can do that, then surely, surely
00:15:05 you must see that it's not the logical extension of that is not, okay, okay, so I can be alone.
00:15:14 And the only alternative is this girl. You've gotten there, kind of, but you're not quite at
00:15:19 the finish line. I haven't seen High School of the Dead. I haven't seen Nate's High School of the
00:15:24 Dead video. But yes, oneitis is bad. You will not, you will, that's, if you know, that's when
00:15:33 you are obsessed with one girl and you're like, oh, this is the only girl for me. That's bad.
00:15:37 That's not healthy. And the idea of like appealing to them is like, oh, you're my friend and I care
00:15:44 about you, right? It's like, you can't, you can't like, if someone doesn't like you, you can't,
00:15:51 you can't appeal to them on the basis of how much you like them, right? Like, no matter,
00:15:57 no matter how much you like someone, that's not gonna make them like you. Like, so there's no
00:16:04 point in appealing, like either they like you or they don't. And maybe there's no, there's no use,
00:16:11 like, there's no end, like the more you try to work on it, like you can't like be like, okay, okay,
00:16:17 well, let me, let me try and fix that. Let me do something to make them like me. It's like, well,
00:16:22 if you're, if you're, if you're deliberately working on that as a project, like it's a bad look,
00:16:27 right? It's like, you shouldn't be, you shouldn't be working on that. You should be doing your thing.
00:16:33 And if someone likes it, they like it, right? So the thing is, so there's no,
00:16:38 there's no fixing that if they don't like you, you just got to, you just got to do your thing.
00:16:43 And if they, maybe, if they change their minds, maybe they, they probably won't,
00:16:48 because you shouldn't be doing anything radically different. You should be doing your thing.
00:16:51 All times, you should be doing your thing. And if you keep doing your thing,
00:16:56 then the people who are into it will be down for it. And they're in, and they're out, and they're
00:17:00 out, but down, and all around, like the Heffalumps and Wuzels. Okay, woo, cool, good, good, good
00:17:06 story, guy. Next one is from Nate, quote, full-time YouTuber and quote, best man. Let's hear what he
00:17:16 asked to say. The other day, it just dawned on me. I'm a full-time YouTuber now. I've kind of been for,
00:17:25 you know, nine, 10, 11 months now, 12 almost. Yeah, how many, and how many videos came out in
00:17:34 that time? Nate, full, I'm reading into the intention of these air quotes here. It's like,
00:17:39 okay, full-time, yeah. Glad, I'm glad you don't have to work a wagey job. But I'm not alone in asking,
00:17:49 where's best anime ever, Ghost in the Shell? Where's Gits, Nate, full-time YouTuber best man?
00:17:56 Give me the content. I want the content.
00:18:04 Oh God, I hope these aren't all about Nate. The next one is called, for real, is Nate sexist?
00:18:12 Let's fucking do it, lads. You know, guys, I don't know how to feel about Nate these days,
00:18:18 you know? It seems like he really hates women and like makes fun of them all the time.
00:18:25 I'm genuinely wondering if he's sexist. Mr. Bestman, do you care to comment?
00:18:31 I'm not sexist. Thank you.
00:18:37 Well, there it is. You mean you heard it. That's it. There's no, there's no more. There's nothing
00:18:42 else to say on the matter. We have the word of God, and that's it, end of discussion. Cool, simple.
00:18:50 Next one is from Margar, who famously has been the last person to call in
00:18:57 a few times in a row now, but not this time. We've got more. We've got plenty more after this.
00:19:04 Let's hear from Margar, shall we? Margar here. I'd like to question my status in voice jail.
00:19:12 Has it been abolished? Am I set free? What happens to a person when there are no police,
00:19:18 but they get arrested? Do I still exist? I still want to send voicemails every week.
00:19:26 It's, I look forward to it now. I have made a pattern of it. Don't put me in jail. I've done
00:19:32 nothing wrong. I like it. Don't do it, please. Well, that's for a judge to decide. I can tell,
00:19:40 okay, the status is there was disagreement about whether voice jail was the proper course of
00:19:46 action. And so your trial was held up. You are currently caught up in red tape. You are being
00:19:51 processed by the system. The system is working. The process is working. It's in the process.
00:19:57 You are being put through the machine. However, while you are not technically in voice jail,
00:20:04 which was not technically about, we did not fully abolish voice jail with the charity stream,
00:20:09 but effectively you are detained and unable and lack your freedom while you are in the
00:20:17 processing phase. And frankly, I intend to use it, do everything in my power to make sure
00:20:24 that the process takes, never comes to completion. You are never brought to trial,
00:20:30 and you are never free. But that's just me. So I hope that answers your question and you're welcome.
00:20:37 Next one is called BLM. Okay. All right. Hey, what's up again? I'm here again talking about
00:20:45 everybody. The last two weeks, I've been trying to get a hold of Nate Bestman because he's a
00:20:50 fucking coward and won't show up on his own show. This is the whole point of him using the N word.
00:20:56 Don't really appreciate it as a viewer and a listener. So he does fucking stuff for that.
00:21:01 Again, and also stop talking over the voicemails. It's really hard to listen
00:21:07 when you're talking over. Okay. You have a limit of 90 seconds. Okay. I got 96 to talk
00:21:12 when I apologize. I deeply, deeply apologize for talking over the voicemail. That's my
00:21:19 bad friend. Nothing else up with me. You know, just chilling right here. Okay. Nate to respond to
00:21:24 this message. Okay. I'm sorry. I can't, I can't, I can't raise all right or
00:21:31 issues of the N word and his reason. Okay, bro. It's not cool. Okay. You wouldn't even say in
00:21:38 front of an African American. Go fuck off. All right.
00:21:45 I, oh God. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm with you. And I think I would mostly agree.
00:21:55 I mean, I know Nate's said it before. I mean, I've said it before. I can't, I have. I just,
00:22:01 it's happened. Ingest always, but I have. So there it is. I don't think it was a good idea.
00:22:08 I'm not like saying like, no, it's fine. I don't know if it is fine, but, but it's happened. So
00:22:13 I'm not above it. But Digi's explanation of why her, what she said. Okay. I hope I'm not
00:22:24 misremembering, but like her explanation is that like she grew up in a school that was like
00:22:30 very much black population and a lot of people there said it all the time and she said it and
00:22:36 it was like a part of growing up in her culture. That doesn't sound completely ridiculous to me.
00:22:45 You know, if you grew up and everyone around you said it, sure. I, I would,
00:22:52 I mean, you wouldn't say it. I don't think did you, or I don't think anyone would say it in
00:22:56 front of like, I know she would probably say it in front of like certain people that she knows,
00:23:01 you know, black people, maybe certain people who she knows is fine with it. Probably she wouldn't
00:23:06 say it in front of just any random person, black person, that would be like real fucked up. So,
00:23:14 I don't know. I personally don't think that I should say it. I don't, you know,
00:23:21 even, even as a joke, I don't necessarily, I don't stand by the times that I've said it in the past
00:23:26 before. It's bad. It's, you shouldn't say it generally. But I'm not here to police anyone's
00:23:31 language. I'm not here to say like, you can't say that. I do think, you know, I might not agree with
00:23:38 it. I might think that generally probably white people probably don't say it, but I'm not gonna,
00:23:45 I don't have the power to enforce that. And I don't think that I can say you can't,
00:23:50 that's just me. It's everyone's, the words you use, ultimately, it's up to you, myself,
00:23:56 I don't think I should say it, but I can't speak for anyone else. But I did not disagreeing with you
00:24:04 in thinking that probably don't say it. So that's my opinion. I don't like it, but I'm not a cop.
00:24:14 Yeah, I think that's what I think about that. Okay, next one. A question people might hate.
00:24:23 Let's see about that. Did Nate stop showing up because there's drama or just because he's cringe?
00:24:34 I mean, Nate has given no explanation why he stopped showing up. He did just move.
00:24:44 I don't know why. I mean, I don't think moving would explain not being on the show for, you know,
00:24:49 like six weeks or whatever. It doesn't take that long to move. I don't think any drama did it,
00:25:00 like I don't recall any particular drama occurring before Nate stopped showing up.
00:25:07 Other than maybe like the,
00:25:11 Nate had had Nate stopped showing up before the channel, the content got deleted. Did he like,
00:25:17 did he like recuse himself out of like shame or something or a general upset about like,
00:25:23 you know, what's happened to the channel? I don't know. I don't know what the relation,
00:25:27 if there's any relationship to that happening here. I have no idea. Short answer, no clue.
00:25:32 No clue why Nate doesn't show up anymore. It doesn't make any sense. Seems really weird to me.
00:25:36 But you know, here I am, the only one still here. So, so clearly I'm the weird one.
00:25:43 All right, cool. Next one is from Doon Koon. My man.
00:25:50 PCP. This is Doon Koon from Procrastinate is Anonymous.
00:25:55 And I demand the immediate release of All Dye Corporation from The Voice Jail.
00:26:00 I am invoking my voice grail status to free my nigga All Dye. Do it or we'll kill you with guns
00:26:08 in Minecraft. Oh God, okay. Hold on. I gotta check something. I gotta check something
00:26:21 real quick here. I'll die. I mean, was not released, was not one of the ones released
00:26:31 from Voice Jail during the BLM stream, right? Let me just make absolutely sure of that. I have the
00:26:39 jail image saved here. Yep, it was. It was Mozilla Fennekin, a well-researched thesis,
00:26:49 and Japanese man Yuta who were freed. Still in there are lol pussies out here eating with spoons,
00:26:57 Lost Tape Archive, All Dye Corporation, Oopsie Bobo, and Fuck Dye Buster.
00:27:02 Those are the ones still in there. I'm pretty sure eating with spoons is TNCP.
00:27:09 Hope I'm remembering that right. But, but,
00:27:16 Doon Koon, I don't remember you being in Voice Grail, but if indeed you are in the Voice Grail,
00:27:22 then we have stipulated before that like Matter and Antimatter, Voice Jail and Voice Grail
00:27:31 cancel one another out and mutually annihilate one another in a burst of pure light that extends
00:27:41 in a time-space cone throughout the fabric of reality. So, if indeed if you're not pulling
00:27:50 one over on me, if you're in the Voice Grail, then there we go. All Dye Corporation, you're free.
00:27:57 You're free, fucker. Congratulations. Pussies out here eating with spoons, Oopsie Bobo,
00:28:03 and Fuck Dye Buster are the only ones left in Voice Jail since Margar is still being processed.
00:28:11 He's not technically made it into his cordoned off cell yet, which why I have specially prepared
00:28:17 for him. He hasn't made it there yet though, so there's only three in there. So we're closer
00:28:22 than ever to abolishing Voice Jail, which obviously I'm conflicted about. Obviously,
00:28:28 I'm of two minds about that. On the one hand, cops bad. On the other, prison labor, highly profitable.
00:28:35 So, I don't know. Let me just, just for reference, let me,
00:28:42 let me make sure, let me remove him from the image so that I won't forget. There we go.
00:28:50 This, it's Canon now. It's, it's Canon. Done. Okay, next up, semi-normie guy. Hmm, I don't like,
00:29:02 I don't like the cut of this guy's jib. Let's see what he's got to say for himself.
00:29:07 About a year ago, I sent in a voicemail to you guys about me considering joining the military.
00:29:12 At the time, I thought it was the most effective and accessible way to help and serve people,
00:29:16 and I thought that it would develop me as a person in ways that only that career path could.
00:29:21 But I was still torn about it, so I asked you guys's advice. Now, one year in change later,
00:29:27 I look back at those thoughts and my frame of mind has just shifted so much on so many issues,
00:29:32 including but obviously not limited to the military. And so I'm almost embarrassed that I even sent
00:29:38 in that voicemail. I just think it's crazy how much people's perspective can change in such a
00:29:43 short amount of time. Anyways, question I'm leading to is, can any of you remember a time in your
00:29:48 life when you looked back and had this similar experience that I'm having now where you're
00:29:53 cringing at your past self for being just fucking idiot? And what was it that you were being an
00:29:59 idiot about? Thanks. Um, well, I think my answer is going to be kind of boring. But like around
00:30:10 like last year, when I fell down the communism hole, I look back at my I look back at my dumb,
00:30:18 confused, milk toasts, no real convictions about anything, you know, sort of vaguely
00:30:25 liberal, centrist self. And I'm like, absolutely disgusted, like how embarrassing,
00:30:30 how embarrassing to be like that. I don't know. So that's that's me. That's this the most obvious
00:30:36 example. Um, um, what else? What else? I don't fucking know. Um, the military, I don't begrudge
00:30:46 anyone serving in the military. I do think that it's probably not. Yeah, I don't think it's
00:30:53 necessarily like a super helpful or heroic thing to do. I don't think like the United States
00:30:58 military is like a force for good in the world really. Um, but you know, you got to do what
00:31:05 you got to do. And they claim to give like some pretty good like veterans benefits, but then at
00:31:10 the same time it seems like they kind of bend over backwards to find loopholes to deny their
00:31:15 veterans benefits. I hear that all the time that it's actually real hard to get the benefits
00:31:19 you're supposed to have and stuff like that. So, you know, I don't know, but um, you know,
00:31:26 an individual who does it because it's like that they're their their quickest path to like
00:31:32 economic security or whatever. It's like, I get it. Um, but also I'm kind of glad you didn't do it
00:31:38 because I don't think it's super, super great, but whatever. Um, it's not necessarily super
00:31:45 really. It's fine. It could be fine maybe, but probably not. That's bad. Don't join the military.
00:31:49 It's stupid. Uh, ACAB, uh, lol. Uh, next one is from who Ben St. really is. Hmm. Terrible.
00:32:00 Guys, I've finally done it. I finally understand who Ben St. really is. Think about this. Ben
00:32:12 is just Chaz Princeton from Yu-Gi-Oh! Who? Chaz Princeton.
00:32:23 Chaz Princeton. Uh, okay. Well, I like his fashion sense. I like his, I like his look. I like his
00:32:31 vibe. Um, he's got, he's got better hair than I do, but I mean it's, this is Yu-Gi-Oh! So that's fine.
00:32:38 Um, uh, let's, let's read, let's read about Chaz Princeton from the Yu-Gi-Oh! wiki. Chaz Princeton,
00:32:46 known as Jun Manjome in the Japanese version, is an arrogant duelist who serves as one of
00:32:52 Jaden Yu-Ki's rivals throughout the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX series. Chaz is considered Jaden's primary
00:32:58 rival in the same, in the same effect that Setokaiba is the primary rival of Yu-Gi mode.
00:33:03 Okay, so I'm the edgy rival of the GX series. Okay, that's good. They do have dueled one another
00:33:10 total of seven times throughout the seasons of the anime. Through his evolution, he goes from
00:33:14 being a duelist who only respected powerful cards. Is that a thing? Is that a thing in Yu-Gi-Oh!
00:33:23 That's like, oh, even weak cards are good. You gotta love your fucking Pokemon. Just battle with
00:33:28 your favorite. That sucks. That sucks so bad. He only respected powerful cards to a duelist who
00:33:34 believes that there can be effectiveness in any card, specifically shown in his use of Ojama cards.
00:33:40 He becomes a marked threat after becoming the North Academy representative, but after that
00:33:46 becomes more and more a comic relief. Yes, it's me. It is me. It's perfect. Uh, in the manga,
00:33:53 Chas serves much the same purpose as in the anime. Very good. Um, I want to know what are these
00:34:01 Ojamas. They're like nasty little goblins. Um, like, what's, are they like little weak
00:34:07 creatures, but with like funny goofy like side effects or something? I don't know. Uh, it's
00:34:13 yeah, you're right. He, he got it. He did it. Um, next voicemail is from
00:34:19 Nat. These are all caps. Naz, question mark, greater than Chas. Well, we just found out that Chas
00:34:25 Princeton is base. So I hope you're not gonna, I hope you're not gonna shit on my boy, but I think
00:34:30 this is talking about the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, I think. Um, I don't know what Naz is, but
00:34:36 let's, let's find out. We're entering a new era, a golden era for the PCP. No more Chas. We are in
00:34:45 the Naz, the Nate Autonomous Zone. What do you guys think? Let's air some grievances, shall we?
00:34:53 Why is Nate so bad at communicating? Why can't he like, you know, let us know he's moving and stuff?
00:34:59 Um, he wanted to move at the end of the last month, but he didn't. Okay, he's moving now,
00:35:05 and that's fine. But what the fuck is up? Where are you at, dog? He's canceled a bunch of streams,
00:35:11 and he hasn't been on any of the episodes. Okay, maybe. Let's say, hypothetically, he's editing
00:35:17 some videos. That's fine and all, but is an hour or two to come hang with you guys really that big
00:35:24 of a time sink? I don't know. I don't know. I don't, I don't know. You know, I don't, I don't have the
00:35:34 answers. I don't have answers to these questions. It really makes you wonder. Uh, the Nate Autonomous
00:35:40 Zone, that doesn't, no, it would be like, because Nate, it's a Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,
00:35:47 then the Nate Autonomous Zone would be an Autonomous Zone located in or around Nate,
00:35:52 so that doesn't work. I don't know what you would call it, but I understand the point.
00:35:57 Uh, yeah, we're free, we're free of his tyranny, the tyranny of his, of his, of his ledgers,
00:36:03 um, and his, and his fucking, his, uh, his, uh, his devil, his devil's advocate centrism. We're
00:36:10 free, everyone. Uh, we've made it to the other side. Uh, no one can fucking stop me. Um, uh,
00:36:17 and here I am. Here I am, you know, speaking truth to power. And, you know, I'm proud of myself.
00:36:23 I'm proud of myself to stand up to bullies. Yeah, yeah. No, no, uh, I don't know. I don't know
00:36:34 what the fuck his deal is, you know, whatever. Uh, he doesn't want to explain himself and that is
00:36:39 his prerogative. Um, next up is from Slyther Slacker. I think I know who this is, but let's
00:36:47 hear him, shall we? Quick clarification. Slyther Sean is also me, a.k.a. the voicemail god.
00:36:55 Also, the reason for that was I rebranded my channel to fit more with my theme. I'm going to
00:37:01 be doing a big ol' UgeoGX lecture in the future. And also, question for y'all. How many notes
00:37:09 or how long were your notes for your lectures? I'm currently sitting on a Google doc at 21 pages.
00:37:17 Um, um, my notes, uh, okay. Well, I'll speak for myself. My, I didn't take that many notes.
00:37:32 My first Sonichi lecture, I didn't have any notes. The only, like, my main notes that I used
00:37:39 were on the board. Like, the board was my notes. I had my phone open to, like, quickly look stuff
00:37:45 up and I did that a couple times in the lecture. Um, in the Unicorn Jelly lecture, I think it was
00:37:51 the same. I didn't really have any, I don't think I had any notes other than what was on the board.
00:37:57 I think, I don't, I don't, I don't remember, but I'm pretty sure. In the Sonichi 2 lecture, which,
00:38:02 I'm sorry it's not out yet, but I'm waiting until, um, after I do the Slime and Punishment
00:38:06 Finale, which is almost done. I have, like, one more shot to make. It is, like, almost
00:38:10 fucking done. Uh, yeah, baby, yeah. Um, uh, in the Sonichi 2 lecture, I did have notes,
00:38:18 not that many. I just kind of, like, I had, like, just like the first one, I had, like,
00:38:23 chapter names on the board and a couple of highlights, but then I, I sort of had a little
00:38:28 bit more elaboration in my little, in a little, little notebook, just a small, little ledger
00:38:34 notebook. So I, my notes were pretty, probably, like, four, like, mini pages, four or five,
00:38:40 like, very mini pages. It was the equivalent of maybe, like, one and a half, like, full-size pages
00:38:44 of notes written at normal size. So, minor. Um, I, I found it, I found it mostly adequate to just read,
00:38:56 reread through the material, since I was already familiar with it, reread through it,
00:39:01 write down notes, sort of highlighting what I considered to be important moments, and then
00:39:07 kind of pair them down to what I actually wanted to talk about, and then just sort of distill those
00:39:10 into bullet points and put them on the thing. And mainly I was able to, like, okay, oh, bullet
00:39:16 point, oh, I remember, and then kind of go on about the details of what the bullet point, um,
00:39:20 was referring to. So yeah, I'm not a big note guy. Uh, and I'm pretty sure that the other guys were
00:39:29 the same. I don't think any of us had, like, a ton of notes. Um, so yeah, for, for me, and I think
00:39:36 for the rest of us, not that much. Uh, next one is from Ben, you ruined my life. Well, I'm ready
00:39:42 to answer for my crimes. Let's go. All right, Ben, it's your roommate, Joe Swanson. I could not
00:39:51 find my legs, so I broke into the kitchen and I took your room, and I took your worm oil,
00:39:58 and I drank it all because I was running low on nutrients, like Paul Blart, Ben. You understand?
00:40:05 I understand, like Paul Blart, yes. I hope it wasn't too important to you, but I would not
00:40:10 recommend you make any more, unless you would like to become a worm as well. You see, on top of not
00:40:17 having legs, I now no longer have arms because I lost them drinking your worm oil. I am now a worm.
00:40:24 It's syrup. It is your roommate, the worm. Don't even know what you're drinking. Good night.
00:40:30 Hey, okay, worm. Uh, is this a reference to In the House of the Worm by George R.R. Martin,
00:40:36 which is a, I haven't read it, but I like know about it. It's like a story that he wrote a long
00:40:42 time ago about like a space colony that has this cult, and they worship this like, sort of dune,
00:40:50 sort of like, worm creature, I think, but like the priests of this worm god, they cut their arms
00:40:57 and legs off to basically make them into, like, resemble a worm. Is that, is it a reference,
00:41:03 or is it just a happy accident? Um, listen, Joe, worm, buddy. Uh, yeah, it was important to me. I
00:41:11 spent like over $100 buying 11 pounds of isomolta oligosaccharides, aka insoluble tapioca fiber.
00:41:24 It took me all day to convert it to, to, to cook it into syrup and bottle it.
00:41:31 It took hours and hours to cool down. It was, it was, it was molten hot and it does not give off
00:41:36 heat. It was like the labrea tar pits. It was, um, just, just a nightmare. I had to put a little,
00:41:42 I had to put it on the, on the living room table and put a note on it with a skull that said,
00:41:47 heat death, don't touch. Um, but, but you, you didn't listen. Um, and the thing about it is that
00:41:53 it's delicious. You can, I'm, I would love to just drink it myself. It's, if it weren't earmarked
00:41:57 from, it's drinkable. You just take a big spoon of it and eat it. It's like honey. It's like a
00:42:01 agave nectar. It's wicked good. So good. I hate you. I hate you, Joe. How could you? You've ruined
00:42:06 my life and I will not be bullied. Um, I will, I will persevere. Um, I will make more worm syrup.
00:42:16 Um, and I will fucking cook you in it. I will, the thing about it is, Joe, if you take that,
00:42:24 if you, I'm trying to experiment, but like how, how much should I cook it down? I bought a candy
00:42:29 thermometer and I'm seeing, and I'm taking little, little small batches of it and cooking it to,
00:42:34 because like the lower the water content, the higher the boiling point, because you know,
00:42:39 adding fiber to it in a solution increases the boiling point. So as you cook it and water cooks
00:42:45 off, the temperature increases higher and higher. This is how it works. So I'm experimenting with
00:42:51 seeing like how hot should I cook it to get it down to the point where it has, I think I want
00:42:56 like the minimum water content possible while still making it like able to be like poured and
00:43:02 work with and added to a solution. But if you cook it way down, like to about 140 degrees Celsius,
00:43:09 it becomes like amber. It becomes like this syrup that once cooled becomes like rock hard and you
00:43:15 can like crack it with a hammer. So what I'm saying is that I'm going to encase you in it, um, and
00:43:21 keep you like Han Solo in, in fucking carbonite hanging on my wall as a trophy. That is your
00:43:29 fate. You brought this upon yourself. Live by the serp, die by the serp. That's, that's, and also,
00:43:38 Eleazar put up a picture of my fucking the syrup that I made on Twitter. It's, it's funny. It's
00:43:43 cool. I'm very excited. Delicious. Next one in this, in this charade. We've got a message from 522.
00:43:58 Oh god, I wanted to burp, but it didn't work. And now my throat feels gross.
00:44:04 522. What's up, buddy?
00:44:06 Ah shit, what game is this? Is it, is it, is it Chrono Trigger? No, it's Earthbound. It's Earthbound.
00:44:29 Where, where, where, where is this going? Where, where is this going?
00:44:36 I mean, it's, it's nice. What a, what a relaxing time. You know, this is just like the solo
00:44:45 Bencast vibe. It's just, you know, just floating through, floating through a, a, a void. But it's,
00:44:53 a vaguely sinister void. That's, that's what this feels like. That's, that's, that's what,
00:44:58 that's what listening to my voice sounds like. And that's what this song sounds like. So it's
00:45:02 very fitting. Appreciate the contribution. You fuck!
00:45:13 Well, um, voice jail. Voice, I'm gonna submit another applicant. You, you're going into processing
00:45:22 along with Margar, 522. You are, the paperwork has been begun. You will be incarcerated at our earliest
00:45:30 possible convenience after we, after we refund the police. Next up, Snowman. What's up, my dude?
00:45:43 Hey guys, I'm a longtime fan of the show. I just wanted to say thanks for making it. It makes
00:45:49 me happy. Bye. Thank you. And you, you see, who was it that said that dumb shit? Who was it that
00:45:58 said, uh, stop, stop? You see, stop recording. People appreciate what I, me, personally do. This
00:46:05 is now a solo effort. I have successfully privatized the PCP. It is mine now. I own it. Uh, this is a,
00:46:13 this is a one man show. Um, and frankly, this was the plan all along. Just make the PCP environment
00:46:21 so toxic, so uninhabitable that all other members would just be forced into, into retirement.
00:46:28 And I would be left, you know, with the spoils. That was the, the treasure, the pot of gold at the
00:46:34 end of the rainbow. I, I made it. I made it through the wilderness. Somehow I made it through. Uh,
00:46:45 it's good. It's good to be the best, but it's lonely at the top.
00:46:53 What's up, the Joker?
00:46:56 I had a vision, a world, world without insane PCP ground out a little profit and YouTube
00:47:07 trying to, trying to shut them down one video at a time. And it was so
00:47:16 great. I've had a change of heart. Speak up.
00:47:23 Should I, should I have all the fun?
00:47:27 Let's give someone, give someone else a chance. If Ben St. isn't cancel pencil in 60 minutes,
00:47:34 and I blow up PCP HQ.
00:47:47 I'm genuinely not sure if that like glitchiness was intentional. I'm leaning towards yes,
00:47:53 but I'm not a hundred. I'm not a hundo on it. Um, blow up the PCP headquarters. We have no need
00:48:00 for it. I was planning to burn it down anyway. Now that, now that it's my show, we don't need
00:48:04 this big office building. It's just taken up space. It's just rent seeking, you know, burn it down.
00:48:10 You know, give it, give it back to nature. You know, humans are truly are the virus.
00:48:15 Um, I think, I think you and I can make beautiful music together. The Joker.
00:48:21 Uh, let's hear from
00:48:23 Drumpf off a bean. Yes, please.
00:48:36 What, what, what? One more time? One, one more time? Hmm?
00:48:40 Defund PCP, execute Ben St. Drink Mountain Dew Game Fuel.
00:48:46 Something, okay, execute Ben St. Drink Mountain Dew Game Refuel. I, I agree with one of those two
00:48:53 things. So I guess I would say that I'm kind of a centrist on this voicemail. I'm, I'm, I'm
00:48:59 semi-pro, semi-against. I, I think, you know, I don't agree with everything you say,
00:49:05 but I will defend to the death. You're right to say it. Mr. Mr. Drumpf, sir. You are a disgrace
00:49:12 to the office, sir. Have you no sense of decency, sir? Uh, military budget approved.
00:49:19 Okay, here we go. Suggestion from a black fan. Oh, no, it's, oh, no, help. Uh, okay, let's hear it.
00:49:29 Crossover episode idea, the PCP with the N-double-A-C-P.
00:49:49 N-double-A-C-P. Nick is angry about Caucasian people. We ain't never going to make it.
00:49:56 You guys like Charlie Brown's Christmas, Charlie Brown's Kwanzaa most offensive video?
00:50:01 It's real good. It's real funny. It's very funny. Racist? I don't think, I don't know. It's just so
00:50:08 fucking whack. It's so wild. It's so out there. I find that it takes a refuge in audacity and
00:50:15 it's, you can't take it seriously to the point that I don't really see, I don't really see it being
00:50:21 that offensive. Maybe that's just me. I don't know. But that's my thoughts on it. Also,
00:50:27 no hard R. I'm safe. Don't cancel me. Um,
00:50:33 because then, because that would just be feeding into the Joker. No, the Joker said we had 60 minutes.
00:50:38 I'm not canceled. I'm not. The Joker did not win. He, he still has to blow up the PCPHQ. He has to
00:50:45 do it. That was he agreed on it and I'm not canceled. So he has to do it. That's part of the
00:50:48 agreement. We live in a society. You gotta keep your promises. Thank you. Mwah. Um, next up.
00:50:59 Poopsack. 25 seconds. Baby.
00:51:06 Howdy. It's me. One of your fans who is not an involuntary celibate. Just wanted to speak up and
00:51:13 remind you guys that you do have fans that are adults with children and careers out there
00:51:19 that do enjoy the constant ramblings of the procrastinators. Keep up the good work, gentlemen
00:51:25 and mage. And remember, there are more like me out there. Cheers.
00:51:32 I mean, I, I, I appreciate it. I, I was just reflecting today on how much I hate kids and
00:51:40 teenagers. They're stupid. They don't know shit. Anytime they do anything good, it's by accident.
00:51:50 They're just, they're just animals, you know, going on instinct. They can't,
00:51:55 they don't, they don't have agency. You know, it's not their fault that they like us. It's just,
00:52:01 you know, an accident. So it doesn't make me feel good. On the other hand, an adult with like a
00:52:09 family, like that seems kind of normie. And that's pretty embarrassing. And frankly, I, I don't know
00:52:14 if, if, if I'm comfortable having you listening to the show. Being that way as you are, I think
00:52:23 that maybe, I think that's a little weird. And I think that maybe you've probably some kind of like,
00:52:27 some kind of like, some kind of like MAP, pedophile, a global elite, adrena comb drinking,
00:52:36 fucking Democrat or something. And frankly, I won't have it. I won't have it on my show. I object. I
00:52:49 don't like it. Well, fuck, man, we're done with the, we're done with the, the voicemails.
00:52:56 We're done with the voicemails and we're not even an hour in. This is unprecedented.
00:53:00 But then this, this, this length is unprecedented. It would be unprecedented for me to end the show
00:53:05 now. But on the other hand, everything about the Ben Solo cast is unprecedented. We're entering
00:53:11 a new age, a golden age. This is the Ben Saints show now. Everyone, there was a secret,
00:53:18 I snuck a secret clause into the contract, into the PCP contract that we all signed in blood
00:53:26 all those years ago that said, if ever an episode happens and it's just Ben, Ben owns the podcast.
00:53:33 It's all, it all, it's all his. It was a, it was like a taunting, you know, that episode of the
00:53:39 Simpsons where it's like, you know, the last one to die gets the art and it's, it's down to, to
00:53:46 Burns versus Grandpa. It was exactly like that. And now here I am. I, I, I did it. I killed all
00:53:53 the other ones. I destroyed them. I drove them away with my toxic personality.
00:53:59 And, and now here I am at the end. Here we are in the future. And it's bright. I own everything.
00:54:08 The, the, the ultimate reward of the PCP. I did it. Remember that? Remember my little pony?
00:54:19 Remember, let's take this moment, this moment of transition, a moment of change, right? Nothing
00:54:26 will ever be the same after this. Let's take this moment to think back to where it all started,
00:54:32 with my little pony, the little, with a little blue horse named Phantom Horn. He never thought
00:54:39 he would see the day when he'd become a big, fancy CEO, corporate executive, head of the
00:54:45 procrastinator's podcast, highfalutin, emailing with the YouTube staff, getting, getting deals,
00:54:53 cutting deals, making, making flip, canceling people, getting canceled on and on. We go round
00:55:03 and round. But here we are. You know what? I'm tempted to try and stretch to an hour, but like,
00:55:14 fuck it, who gives a shit? Thanks for listening, everybody. You're welcome. You're welcome for
00:55:22 being the guy who shows up to deliver this quality content directly to your ears and
00:55:31 for being, for having the good taste and the good sense to make it just as long as it needs to be,
00:55:35 just, just, just perfect, the optimal length, the ideal format. Here it is. And it's me. I'm the guy
00:55:45 who did it. If you want to hear more bonus episodes of the PCP with other guys, I don't know why you
00:55:53 would want to hear other people, but if you, if that seems like something you would consider,
00:55:59 patreon.com slash the procrastinators, you get access to all our fucking bonus episodes.
00:56:03 There's like 40 hundred of them right now. That's a fucking deal if ever there was one.
00:56:08 patreon.com slash Ben St. If you want to hear more solo Ben casts and hear me answering questions,
00:56:14 that's what this is. On the solo Ben cast, Patreon Q&A, people put type questions in the comments
00:56:20 and I answer them. And usually I go on longer for each one because they're more,
00:56:24 generally people ask me things more specifically about me that I have more to say about.
00:56:28 It's better. What am I, am I saying that the Ben St. Patreon Q&A podcast is better in every way
00:56:34 than the procrastinators podcast? And yeah, as a matter of fact, I am. Sue me. Send a voicemail
00:56:42 to speakpipe at, is it at the procrastinators mail at gmail.com.
00:56:49 Wait, no, that's not the, the link is teespring, put gumroad, redbubble, speak, speakpipe.com slash
00:56:56 pcp voicemail. Always fuck it up. Send the voicemail. And I'll read it. I'll listen to it,
00:57:02 because as you see, I don't curate anything. I'm an anarchist. And, and I don't believe in censorship.
00:57:10 And I, I'll just give it over to the fucking, I'll throw, I'll throw the shit to the fucking wolves
00:57:16 and let them devour it. Anything goes. It's chaos. Fuck the police.
00:57:20 Um, and I guess that's the perfect note to end on. Thanks for listening, everybody.
00:57:26 Thanks for being a pet. Hey, fuck YouTube. Hey, YouTube, die. Hey, thanks for nothing.
00:57:30 Hey, thanks for fucking our show for no reason. And then just pretending you're going to fix it
00:57:34 when you're not going to. Thanks for everything. You're really fucking nailed it. You're really
00:57:38 cool guys. It's really like fair and good and nice. And you're a good company and you,
00:57:44 and it's cool. It's great. You did it. Thanks and have a great day, everyone. See you on the next episode.
