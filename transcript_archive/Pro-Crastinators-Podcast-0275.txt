00:00:00 Feels like it was like two days ago that we recorded the last time.
00:00:03 Yeah, that's how I always feel. I'm like, where did my week go?
00:00:08 I only did like, I only got to spend like one and a half days doing the work I wanted to do.
00:00:16 Oh well.
00:00:19 Not doing the work I wanted to do today at all because I'm doing this fucking podcast.
00:00:24 All right. I'll get the voicemails.
00:00:30 Cyber Shell and Gamers Tavern, we're going to be on. Anyway, who's that? Gamers Tavern. Gamers Tavern.
00:00:43 Can you hear me now?
00:00:44 Hey, we can hear you. And there's Cyber Shell. There's number, what's number five? Yo!
00:00:54 I'm getting the voicemails.
00:00:55 Can you believe we have a full roster of people on this episode?
00:01:02 It's like a real podcast. Oh, we, my God, we qualify.
00:01:08 You thought it was going to be only four people.
00:01:10 Yeah, I saw your message and I was like, I'm going to ruin this guy's whole career.
00:01:16 Okay. Well, day ruins.
00:01:20 I only appear on this podcast to dab on Ben Saint and ruin his day.
00:01:24 That's the only reason any of us are here, right?
00:01:26 The only reason I even am here is to bait people into trying to dunk on me by being on.
00:01:37 To masturbate people.
00:01:40 No.
00:01:46 Voice mail, voicemails, voicemails.
00:01:50 There's not, there's not that many. There's like less than, there's a little less than usual,
00:01:53 so that's good. Fucking finally, yeah.
00:01:57 Only 90 minutes worth.
00:01:59 There's only just over one full page of them, usually there's a page and a half.
00:02:04 Yeah.
00:02:08 They're all going to be like, only just a, only just an hour.
00:02:14 If we only spend an hour on voicemails, I'll call that a win.
00:02:19 There's no winning. I'll take whatever, I'll take it and it whatever.
00:02:22 Maybe they're all just like really well thought out questions and they're all just very good.
00:02:28 It's possible, it's possible, like it's possible that the sun could simultaneously
00:02:36 go supernova right now. It's possible when the odds are possible.
00:02:41 We're all praying for it, but who knows if it's going to happen.
00:02:43 Yeah, yeah. Just like the heat death of the universe happening immediately.
00:02:48 A quantum event, an atom spontaneously transforming into another element.
00:02:54 I have yearned to witness such a rare event.
00:02:58 That's what the Dr. Manhattan says, right? That's like the...
00:03:00 Yeah, yeah. That's part of this little monologue, I believe.
00:03:05 About how humans are all special.
00:03:08 You know, I liked it better when Barney sang the song about how I'm special and I'm the only one.
00:03:13 I didn't like being condescended to by Dr. Manhattan. It just wasn't the same.
00:03:19 Yeah, his thing was kind of some bullshit, to be honest. It was like, oh,
00:03:21 now I realize the odds of this specific person existing, this specific sperm and egg,
00:03:27 like what are cosmic twins? Yeah, whatever. It's like bullshit.
00:03:31 You could point to literally anything that exists and be like, it's...
00:03:35 I can't believe this exists. I can't believe what's on Mars is this shape.
00:03:39 Right. That's basically what he was like. He went to Mars and was like, this is so cool.
00:03:44 That's what betrayed Dr. Manhattan, not as a super fucking genius scientist man,
00:03:48 but as a construct written by a normal comic book artist.
00:03:53 Yeah, he had to take this based character and turn him back into some cheesy fucking,
00:03:57 yeah, humanity's good kind of shit. Oof, big oof.
00:04:01 Yeah. Yeah.
00:04:03 Sad. Fuck you, Alan Moore, you hack.
00:04:06 They did a pretty good job of trying to write a character who loses all his humanity,
00:04:10 but I guess it would be a little too depressing if that was just the...
00:04:13 I mean, he does fuck off at the end of the story, but if he just was like,
00:04:16 nah, I'm not even going to fucking help a little bit during the climax,
00:04:19 that would have been a little too depressing.
00:04:22 I don't know. I think it would have been pretty sick.
00:04:24 People weren't ready for that yet. People were barely ready for Watchmen.
00:04:27 People are still like, they couldn't even conceptualize comics besides being just,
00:04:32 you know, cape shit, whatever the standard was in the 80s.
00:04:36 Fair enough.
00:04:37 I mean, I'm sure there were good comics before Watchmen and fucking Dark Knight Returns,
00:04:41 but I don't know. I'm not really a comics expert.
00:04:44 Um, there was, um, there was, uh, oh, who was that? I was just reading about...
00:04:52 He wasn't like a comic book character. He was like a radio serial character,
00:04:56 and he's the guy who Darkwing Duck is based on. I think he's called The Shadow.
00:05:00 I think he's like... Oh yeah, I know, I know what you're talking about.
00:05:02 Yeah, The Shadow's a real thing.
00:05:04 Yeah, I guess he was not a comic book character.
00:05:07 He was like a film noir guy, right?
00:05:08 It was before they invented drawing,
00:05:11 so they just had to tell stories about him on the radio, I think.
00:05:15 Oh, jeez. It was a long time ago.
00:05:16 It was like a big inspiration on Batman or something.
00:05:19 Yes, yes. I think so.
00:05:22 They like homage The Shadow in an episode of Batman the Animated Series
00:05:26 by making their own version of Shadow called The Great.
00:05:27 And what if The Shadow was a furry? That's Batman.
00:05:32 And Darkwing Duck is also, he's kind of like, he's more The Shadow,
00:05:36 but like, since The Shadow is like such a dated reference,
00:05:39 he was he was often more of like a Batman parody because like that was
00:05:44 contemporaneous.
00:05:45 Well, they're a duck man.
00:05:48 That's right, it's Darkwing Duck, isn't it?
00:05:50 No, I mean, like a guy who's got like a spandex, he's got like, you know,
00:05:55 suit, but then his signature moot aesthetic is that his mask is like a duck bill,
00:06:02 and he makes a duck quank.
00:06:04 I mean, ducks aren't that scary, but I mean, Goose Man, that could be scary.
00:06:07 I'm kind of scared of Gooses.
00:06:10 His signature move is ducking.
00:06:13 Yeah, you can't hit me if I'm if I'm going to duck under it.
00:06:17 That's good.
00:06:18 You could definitely get a really gross looking cartoon called Duck.
00:06:21 There is, there is a, does Donald get turned into a superhero by that one,
00:06:27 like Professor Duck?
00:06:29 No, no, it's not.
00:06:31 It's another character from Duck Towns.
00:06:33 I forgot his name.
00:06:35 Duck Dodgers?
00:06:36 No, is it?
00:06:37 Um, that's that's Daffy.
00:06:39 Is it?
00:06:39 Is it the who's the fucking the big duck, the big guy, uh, Launchpad?
00:06:43 Launchpad McQuack?
00:06:44 He does not become the it's like some scientist guy who works and like he
00:06:50 gets like the suit and he becomes so like he becomes a gizmo duck.
00:06:56 That's true.
00:06:56 I remember gizmo duck.
00:06:58 Yeah.
00:06:58 I remember gizmo duck.
00:07:02 Learning a lot.
00:07:03 Universe is so extensive.
00:07:06 Why does it exist?
00:07:08 Such a, such a mystery.
00:07:10 You've got to find like the equivalent of the flan.
00:07:13 Fenton is his name.
00:07:15 Fenton becomes gizmo.
00:07:17 What do ducks do?
00:07:18 I guess they just honk.
00:07:19 Why are there so many ducks?
00:07:21 But they, uh, there was a duck.
00:07:23 Gizmo, gizmo, but gizmo duck is not the guy who gets, there's like a game.
00:07:28 There's like a video game about not technically it's Donald, but they don't
00:07:32 call him Donald and I think he's technically not the same character.
00:07:35 I know, I know what you mean.
00:07:36 Uh, I forgot the name, but it was a game on a super Nintendo and the Genesis.
00:07:41 We're learning so many things right now in a podcast.
00:07:44 There was a show in the late 90s about Donald duck becoming like a ninja.
00:07:49 Yeah.
00:07:50 The ninja one.
00:07:51 The ninja one.
00:07:52 I think there was maybe a game grumps about it.
00:07:55 Maui Mallard?
00:07:57 Yeah, that's the one.
00:07:57 Yeah, maybe.
00:07:59 Maui Mallard.
00:08:00 Yeah.
00:08:01 Oh, yeah.
00:08:03 I actually recognize this box art now.
00:08:06 I can't believe there was a Donald duck as a ninja game.
00:08:08 What the fuck?
00:08:09 It's actually weirder than kind of words.
00:08:12 Yeah, I rented that game years ago and it's, uh, it's kind of mediocre, honestly.
00:08:18 Maui Mallard is a medium boiled detective.
00:08:23 Oh, because of eggs.
00:08:26 Jesus Christ.
00:08:28 Wait, you can't medium boil out an egg.
00:08:31 Why is he medium boiled?
00:08:33 You can hard boil it and you can soft boil it.
00:08:35 I think she's not hardcore enough.
00:08:37 So it's just in between soft and hard boiled.
00:08:40 Okay.
00:08:40 Yeah.
00:08:42 This is not hard enough.
00:08:43 Lane.
00:08:45 There was a lot of demand for duck and Donald duck related media in the 90s.
00:08:50 It's huge in like parts of Europe.
00:08:54 Like in some European countries, duck stuff is like really big in culture.
00:09:01 Uh, in Germany, I went to, there was a like a celebration when I was there and there
00:09:06 were a bunch of, I saw people dressed as it's the goons.
00:09:10 It's like the evil goons that like try to steal Scrooge's fortune.
00:09:15 And like, I didn't even know what they were all the be the be the beagle boys.
00:09:19 Yes.
00:09:19 I saw people dressed as the beagle boys.
00:09:22 It's like, I don't even know if anyone would know what that is.
00:09:26 I'm looking at the list of fictional ducks on Wikipedia.
00:09:31 And I've got like the ducks from duck hunt in video game section.
00:09:37 If they remade duck tails, they would just replace them with Jeff Bezos, right?
00:09:43 No, they replaced, uh, one of the rich ducks in the duck tails remake with like basically
00:09:47 Mark Zuckerberg.
00:09:50 That makes sense.
00:09:51 There are a lot of ducks.
00:09:52 Social media fictional ducks, I mean.
00:09:55 There's so many ducks.
00:09:57 I mean, there's, I mean, the whole, the whole duck of verse is.
00:10:00 Are we just going to have the duck episode where it's like, all right.
00:10:03 We're not even recording.
00:10:04 This is completely wasted.
00:10:05 Donald Duck.
00:10:06 No, Craig's recording.
00:10:07 This is all the bonus episodes.
00:10:09 Thank fucking God.
00:10:10 Yeah.
00:10:10 This is going to be a really short episode.
00:10:12 I started recording.
00:10:13 I was saying.
00:10:14 I just throw out my audacity because I was like, this is too good.
00:10:21 I think ducks in other media.
00:10:23 And the second example is duck guy from don't hug me.
00:10:26 I'm scared.
00:10:28 Yeah.
00:10:28 Oh yeah, I remember that.
00:10:29 The duck guy.
00:10:30 I don't know why it just cracks you up.
00:10:31 It doesn't have a name or anything.
00:10:33 Pretty fair.
00:10:34 Maybe we should just, maybe Ellie is, I should just put this in the main episode.
00:10:38 I'm not against it.
00:10:39 I started recording, but I don't have the, I don't have the beginning of the duck conversation.
00:10:42 I know Craig should have it, but.
00:10:44 Craig has, Craig has, I just.
00:10:45 You can have 15 minutes of an episode if we just include all of this.
00:10:48 I didn't even get to start off with my customary joke.
00:10:53 Well, we can have an official start and then the unofficial start, which is our duck conversation.
00:10:58 Let's, let's sync now while we've got the chance on the count of three, say sync.
00:11:03 One, two, three, saying.
00:11:05 Same.
00:11:06 Why?
00:11:06 Sorry, my headphones were off.
00:11:08 Fringe.
00:11:10 Okay, I'll do it again.
00:11:11 One, two, three, saying.
00:11:12 Same.
00:11:12 Same.
00:11:13 One, two, three, saying.
00:11:15 Same.
00:11:15 Same.
00:11:16 Okay, I'm gonna move my mic.
00:11:17 Ha, ha, ha.
00:11:18 Yeah.
00:11:19 Okay, there we go.
00:11:20 Um, ducks thumbs up.
00:11:27 Duck tails.
00:11:29 I didn't like, I feel like maybe I talked about this on another episode,
00:11:32 but I didn't like duck tails.
00:11:34 I thought that, I thought that cartoons with animal characters were baby shit.
00:11:39 I thought Disney cartoons were baby shit and I thought animals were baby shit.
00:11:44 You definitely weren't a furry.
00:11:46 No, no.
00:11:48 Sounds like an opinion edge lord contrarian fancy.
00:11:52 Yeah, a little.
00:11:54 I thought animal shows were baby shit until I grew up.
00:11:57 And then I got all into my little ponies.
00:11:59 Then I thought they were hot.
00:12:00 Take care.
00:12:02 Until I saw the quantities.
00:12:03 Well, after my sexual awakening, I realized that they, the ducks could be fucks as well.
00:12:09 I could fuck the ducks and now everything changed.
00:12:14 Things would never be the same after the Fire Nation attacks.
00:12:18 After the, ah, whatever.
00:12:22 Oh, after the Duck Nation attacks with the duck bending powers.
00:12:26 After everything changed after Duckburg attack.
00:12:29 Duckburg would never be the same.
00:12:31 My favorite duck show actually was Darkwing duck and not duck tails because
00:12:37 I liked the concept of a hero who sucks at everything
00:12:41 because that was basically the plot of the show.
00:12:44 Just so relatable.
00:12:45 No, he's, he's good when he, when he tries.
00:12:49 He's mostly incompetent.
00:12:52 I don't agree.
00:12:53 He's, he's not motivated.
00:12:56 He doesn't want to, he's unmotivated, but when he puts his mind to it, he's pretty good at crime fighting.
00:13:03 He mostly does it to become popular.
00:13:06 So it kind of reminds me of like a YouTuber that just does videos to become popular.
00:13:11 Like every YouTuber.
00:13:13 So he just wants to be a hero to be popular and he kind of sucks at it.
00:13:18 I just liked it because it was very, it was a very cynical show, even though it was a kid's show.
00:13:24 Yeah.
00:13:25 Now, now I'm thinking of like a YouTuber going around dressed up as a superhero,
00:13:31 going into alleyways and beating people up for views.
00:13:35 Yeah, that would be a good idea actually.
00:13:36 That probably exists to some degree.
00:13:38 That's like Phoenix Jones, right?
00:13:40 I was gonna say that.
00:13:41 He wasn't like a full-on YouTuber, but like that's basically what it is.
00:13:44 He had a, he had a big social media presence.
00:13:47 Yeah, he had a YouTube channel.
00:13:50 Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess he was a YouTuber.
00:13:52 I guess he could technically be considered one.
00:13:53 I just, I just, I watched that atrocity guy the other day.
00:13:57 Maybe that's an idea for the YID crew.
00:14:00 Ooh.
00:14:00 Which is gonna become crime fighters.
00:14:04 It's a new niche on YouTube.
00:14:06 I could definitely see that.
00:14:07 People would love that content.
00:14:08 Riley already has a cape.
00:14:11 That's true.
00:14:11 I mean, that could be the name, that could be the name of their like superhero team,
00:14:14 the branches of YID.
00:14:17 Dude, that is like a bad idea.
00:14:20 Um, did you guys see that May is pregnant?
00:14:24 Excuse me?
00:14:25 What?
00:14:26 I saw you celebrating the good news on Twitter.
00:14:28 He seems so happy about it.
00:14:30 Oh, you saw that?
00:14:31 Yeah.
00:14:32 She, she's, you know, I'm just, god, I'm glad someone is protecting the white race.
00:14:38 All right.
00:14:38 Because Biden sure as hell isn't doing a, doing a damn thing.
00:14:42 Um, what a night.
00:14:46 No, Maya, she, she tweeted like the, the census stats saying that like white people,
00:14:51 there are fewer white people and she said, oh, I'm so, this is a girl.
00:14:54 I'm so glad I'm having a baby now.
00:14:56 This is the now is the best time I need to be having babies now.
00:14:59 This is so weird.
00:15:01 Good for you.
00:15:02 Love it for you.
00:15:04 That's so strange.
00:15:06 It almost sounds like a coat.
00:15:07 It's totally.
00:15:08 It almost.
00:15:09 I don't even know whether she's happy about it or not.
00:15:11 I guess she is.
00:15:12 I, I can, I, yeah, I feel, yeah, I feel like I want to read it that way.
00:15:16 I guess I could, I could maybe see.
00:15:17 Oh, I mean, no, no, no, no, no, this is good.
00:15:20 This is good.
00:15:20 The white, white race needs this.
00:15:23 I, I should be happy about it.
00:15:24 Maybe, maybe.
00:15:25 Having children just sounds like a nightmare.
00:15:27 And so, yeah, it doesn't matter who is having children.
00:15:32 I'm always just like, no.
00:15:34 I mean, I don't want to, I'm not actually that caught up with my Ethan Ralph
00:15:38 Laura, but he didn't.
00:15:39 He just had like another child born to some other woman who's like.
00:15:44 Yeah, the last training order against him or some shit now.
00:15:46 So it's just like, you know, he's staying busy.
00:15:48 You got to respect the hustle, just constantly having new children.
00:15:52 The first won't share the first, the first marriage and immediate pregnancy,
00:15:56 and then divorce ended in like extra, it protracted, you know,
00:16:00 divorce proceedings and harassment lawsuits and all that.
00:16:03 But I'm sure this time it'll work out a lot different.
00:16:07 The best thing you can do is have a rock solid foundation.
00:16:10 Make it all content for social media and be posting that all the time.
00:16:14 So there's no way you can bite your in the ass when it goes wrong.
00:16:16 It's all going to work out.
00:16:17 And if it doesn't, hey, it's great.
00:16:19 It's going to make great content.
00:16:21 Yeah, it's good content either way.
00:16:22 God, I only have to be on the fucking show.
00:16:26 Going to the divorce, going to divorce court, going to divorce court
00:16:31 and just being like, hey guys, it's your boy vlogging you from,
00:16:36 from divorce court.
00:16:37 So big dance is going to be great.
00:16:39 Yeah, that's a good idea.
00:16:39 I'm going to get married for content.
00:16:41 Get married.
00:16:42 Why not?
00:16:43 They're worse.
00:16:44 They're worse reasons.
00:16:45 Yeah, it's a fantastic idea.
00:16:47 So much, so many like donations coming in.
00:16:51 We'll be great.
00:16:51 This childbirth will be great content.
00:16:53 I bet, I bet somewhere.
00:16:54 I think there's already a, I think there's already an entire genre of YouTubers
00:16:59 that have done that before.
00:17:01 Yeah, I love the idea of someone like live streaming their whole wedding
00:17:04 and like right in the middle of the proceedings.
00:17:06 Like, yo, what's up?
00:17:07 Thanks, pussy fucker 69 for the $100 donation.
00:17:10 Really appreciate it.
00:17:12 That's definitely real.
00:17:13 That's, that's, it's definitely happened.
00:17:15 I know people have live streamed their weddings,
00:17:17 but I don't know if anyone's ever stopped for donuts.
00:17:19 That's not in the future.
00:17:21 That's the past.
00:17:21 Before the vows, can we just catch up on donuts quickly?
00:17:25 Do you take your fellow content creator to be your, your YouTube partner?
00:17:31 Uh, uh, uh, till, uh, till a copyright, copyright strikes.
00:17:34 What are you doing at this wedding?
00:17:41 The first streamer to get married in a chat.
00:17:43 They turn, they turn the wedding into a review of something.
00:17:47 Like, like this is the pretext, this like the beginning skit is the wedding.
00:17:52 And then they turn the camera and they start talking about fucking.
00:17:55 I'm here to review, I don't know.
00:17:57 Reviewing marriage.
00:17:59 You know, it started off like a, the plot of super paper Mario.
00:18:03 First, first wedding.
00:18:05 This is a good like a concept for like boomer reviews on YouTube.
00:18:09 Like, uh, today I'm reviewing my dumb bitch wife.
00:18:15 First of all, I hate my fucking wife.
00:18:17 The game feel, the game feel is, it leaves a lot to be desired.
00:18:21 The graphics are pretty, pretty realistic.
00:18:23 Um, you know, maybe a little too realistic.
00:18:27 There was a lot of false advertising for this game.
00:18:30 A lot of bull shots before the marriage started, but, uh,
00:18:34 now that it's released, definitely a visual downgrade.
00:18:38 The devs, not a lot of replay value patches.
00:18:42 The patches just starting to know what that would mean.
00:18:44 It's, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a band and wear.
00:18:46 This marriage is a band and wear.
00:18:48 Now that I'm a few months into this marriage,
00:18:50 it's pretty obvious to me the economy is very pay to win.
00:18:53 Hahahahaha!
00:18:56 Yes!
00:18:56 This game is not fucking balanced.
00:18:58 This sucks.
00:19:02 Just gotta, you just gotta patch it, I don't know.
00:19:04 You just gotta, well, but at least it's good content.
00:19:07 At least I can stream it on Twitch.tv.
00:19:09 Uh, uh, I'm, I'm, yeah.
00:19:11 I'm what you could call the DSP of getting married.
00:19:14 Um, you know, I complain, you just edit the game.
00:19:17 You walk home and your fucking wife's cheating on you
00:19:20 and you're just like, wow, there was nothing I could do!
00:19:22 Just get good, oh my god, omega lull, just get good, marriage, just get good, and she wants you.
00:19:30 Get a cut to the chat, it's just omega lulling at you.
00:19:32 Compilations, guys, this is how you don't get married.
00:19:35 This is how you don't live your domestic life.
00:19:41 When people do mukbang, and I think people like livestream them sleeping, I don't even know if that's allowed.
00:19:48 You could do the entire, entire life challenge livestream, entire life livestreamed.
00:19:53 There's like, in real life streamers, you basically just stream their whole lives like, just incidentally, so I'm not surprised if someone out there is basically doing that right now.
00:20:03 Having a baby, so I can mount a fucking digital head camera to it, and then just livestream, it's POV 24, it's entire life.
00:20:12 You can basically do this, you know, you can like, have a kid and be like, on broadcasting it every day on social media.
00:20:18 You're basically making them have like, a little Truman show, and they got it sent to a channel.
00:20:22 We gotta monetize. Baby, you're not, this baby, I gotta feed and clothe it while it better pay for itself with content.
00:20:31 Wait, wait, wait, I need to write all these ideas down.
00:20:34 The Gamer's Tavern Empire is about to begin.
00:20:38 This is the next wave of content.
00:20:40 This is the rocketing to Twitch stardom.
00:20:43 Every time you sit down to have just dinner with your family, you like, have to set up all these like, mics.
00:20:48 They're like, Dad, we don't wanna do a podcast, we just wanna eat dinner.
00:20:51 It's like, shut up, we gotta do another podcast episode. This is the bonus episode.
00:20:54 Honey, did you wash your hands before the podcast?
00:20:57 Did you, uh, did you, uh, make, make sure you gotta clean your plate before we, before we, uh, sign off the podcast and ask everyone to like, comment, and subscribe?
00:21:08 It's like, uh, Dad, we're tired, we just wanna go to bed.
00:21:11 He's like, quiet, we only have a few more pages of voicemails, just be quiet.
00:21:15 Damn, this is, this is too real.
00:21:18 Uh, this, this is, this is just, damn, I can't believe we live in 1984 and the world is really like this now.
00:21:25 I mean, it's not even that far removed from like, celebrities, children being in the spotlight and having to like,
00:21:32 growing up, like, knowing to pose for cameras and doing photo shoots and being so disconnected from actual real life.
00:21:37 Man, this is just the modern, this is the modern version of that.
00:21:41 Like, uh, if I can, Jayden Smith or something.
00:21:44 Yeah.
00:21:45 Right.
00:21:46 Yeah, you know, it is kind of like Jayden Smith has said some infamously hilarious things, but like, I mean, you know,
00:21:51 Yeah, he actually had people paying attention like his Twitter account when he was like a tiny little kid, you know what I mean?
00:21:56 Like, of course he's gonna have all the dumb shit he said recorded.
00:21:59 It's, can you really hold that against him?
00:22:01 I probably said some pretty stupid shit as a kid, but luckily nobody cared.
00:22:04 I said some pretty stupid shit like last year.
00:22:07 Oh, we know, we know.
00:22:09 Just as embarrassing.
00:22:10 We didn't forget.
00:22:12 Um, it's like.
00:22:13 Got my wrist, it's ready to go.
00:22:15 Was it, was it the, was it the YMS review of the, that one movie with the Ursa?
00:22:20 Which fucking?
00:22:21 After Earth.
00:22:22 Yeah, yeah.
00:22:23 Oh, yeah.
00:22:24 There's the clips, there's the clips of like the, it's like Will Smith and his whole family on talk shows and sometimes like,
00:22:31 sometimes like they make jokes like at Jayden's expense and like they laugh at him and like his dad like laughs at him when he makes a fool of himself.
00:22:39 It's kind of funny, but it's also like, wow, that's bizarre.
00:22:42 There are a lot of interesting like things you can find from those just like behind the scenes, like touring and like promotional videos.
00:22:49 Like cause they record so much promotional bullshit.
00:22:51 Like that's something I appreciate.
00:22:52 Like YMS will like, nobody's doing like a Lion King review.
00:22:55 He'll like go through like all the fucking promotional red carpet shit just looking for the highlights of like cringe and just weird interpersonal moments like that.
00:23:03 You know what I mean?
00:23:04 Yeah.
00:23:05 It's, it is like, I remember in that one, it does like the way Will Smith talks about the movie is like, yeah, I guess you can,
00:23:13 he had a certain attitude toward the production and it does kind of come across in the movie itself and like why it is the way it is, you know,
00:23:20 why is my son the star of this movie even though he's bad at playing this role?
00:23:25 Well, it was a little family project.
00:23:28 That movie had like weird Scientology undertones to it.
00:23:33 What kind of undertones?
00:23:35 Scientology, I don't know.
00:23:36 There's like a lot of weird parallels.
00:23:38 That movie was just weird because like they decided to have Will Smith be like calm and like not emote, which is like, that's not really the kind of acting he's the best at.
00:23:47 He just had a vehicle for his son.
00:23:49 So he had to take the backseat before.
00:23:51 Right.
00:23:52 Right.
00:23:53 It was a vehicle for his son, I guess, but nobody wanted that.
00:23:55 They just wanted to see Will Smith be Will Smith.
00:23:58 Not even Jaden Smith wanted it.
00:24:00 Right.
00:24:01 Is he still acting and stuff?
00:24:03 I mean, I assume it has to be, right?
00:24:05 The only thing I remember Jaden Smith being in was what was that fucking anime on Netflix?
00:24:09 Oh, right.
00:24:10 Right.
00:24:11 Oh, the one with the Tobleron?
00:24:12 Neo-Yokio.
00:24:13 Neo-Yokio.
00:24:14 That was it.
00:24:15 That was it.
00:24:16 I only remember that image of the Tobleron.
00:24:18 Yeah, I think it was.
00:24:19 I think it was Neo-Yokio.
00:24:20 It was pretty funny.
00:24:23 Oh, no.
00:24:24 I'm real at it.
00:24:25 Oh, no.
00:24:26 I only have disk space remaining for three hours and 14 minutes.
00:24:29 Oh, dear.
00:24:30 I got to clear some space.
00:24:32 That's pretty mad.
00:24:33 I guess.
00:24:34 I guess that means no voicemails this week.
00:24:36 Oh, no.
00:24:37 What a nightmare.
00:24:38 It's like four hours now, so.
00:24:41 There's five people on here.
00:24:43 I can see ourselves going four hours easy.
00:24:46 Since Cyber Shield is on this one, it's probably going to be five hours.
00:24:50 Well, we had to take, last time we had Laserbot.
00:24:53 That was like a historic moment.
00:24:55 That was a world historic event that'll be in history books.
00:24:58 That's true.
00:25:00 It's all been overshadowed.
00:25:03 It's all been overshadowed by the Chris Chan news.
00:25:07 It's such.
00:25:08 It is so funny the timing of that and how you had to rush to put out your Sonichu thing.
00:25:14 I mean, you didn't actually have to, but I agree that that was probably the best way
00:25:18 to do it.
00:25:19 I was better immediately than later, I think.
00:25:23 I wish I had just put it out a year ago.
00:25:25 Like you said, it's not like, if it was already out, it would still be getting a spike of
00:25:30 views.
00:25:31 All Chris Chan content was getting a spike.
00:25:33 Ideally, it would have been better if you just had put it out like a year ago or at
00:25:38 least six months ago.
00:25:39 Yeah.
00:25:40 I didn't gain anything by waiting.
00:25:43 I thought, I mean, I thought, I really thought that it was the end of Crystory and nothing
00:25:48 else of interest was ever going to happen.
00:25:50 Truly, it didn't matter if it came out.
00:25:52 Nothing had happened for like years.
00:25:54 It really seemed like it was sort of tucking in.
00:25:56 And now it's like, this is the most relevant Chris Chan will ever be.
00:25:59 I have to believe in my heart that there will never be another like more mainstream event
00:26:05 than this.
00:26:06 Like please, for God's sake.
00:26:08 Yeah.
00:26:09 I hope it never gets more, any more confidence.
00:26:12 As someone who has known about Chris Chan since like, I don't know, before 2010, watching
00:26:18 all of this was pretty surreal for me.
00:26:21 It's horrifying.
00:26:22 It's just, it's just horrifying.
00:26:25 I think I watched that Tucker segment on a voucher.
00:26:29 I didn't watch the segment.
00:26:31 The segment is weird because it's, he says like, you know, Baba Chris Chan, Baba biological
00:26:38 male, and then he moves on to like some other talking point.
00:26:41 He barely even, barely knows anything about.
00:26:45 He's literally just like, oh, we can say this is bad because of trans people.
00:26:49 I feel like it's not as like a pivotal turn.
00:26:52 I don't think it's a pivotal turning point that's like, Oh no, now loads more people
00:26:56 are going to think that trans people are just like this.
00:26:59 I think it was just like one in like just another.
00:27:02 Any, any same thing will realize there's like no connection.
00:27:05 It's just, it's just a talking point.
00:27:08 Yeah, I already have the same talking point.
00:27:11 Like you said, he barely, he barely mentions Chris Chan.
00:27:14 It's, it's, it's like you could just, just have a list just like any time a trans person
00:27:19 does a crime.
00:27:20 Just like talking was like, all right, time for the segment.
00:27:22 And he'll just read off the list.
00:27:23 This crime, this crime, this crime.
00:27:25 Okay, there we go.
00:27:26 Trans bad.
00:27:27 Someone pointed out that it was like, I think Tucker Carlson thought his name or thought
00:27:31 Christine's name was Chris Chan.
00:27:33 Like everybody thinks that.
00:27:34 But it's not.
00:27:35 I mean, that's not, that doesn't even make sense.
00:27:37 Like do people, I mean, okay, whatever.
00:27:38 I guess it makes even theoretically possible.
00:27:40 But like even people that should know, I've seen them writing it as two separate words,
00:27:44 Chris space, capital Chan.
00:27:46 And like, no, it's Chris dash Chan.
00:27:48 It's the Japanese diminutive.
00:27:50 Maybe I've just been too much online, but like that seems so obvious to me.
00:27:53 Like obviously it's short for something.
00:27:55 It's the Japanese diminutive.
00:27:58 It's the Japanese diminutive and it's short for Chandler, but it's not a name in and of
00:28:03 itself.
00:28:04 She's not Chris.
00:28:05 We have to forgive Tucker.
00:28:07 He's not very cultured.
00:28:09 Yeah.
00:28:10 He doesn't know deep internet lore, which is embarrassing.
00:28:12 You should watch Ben's lecture.
00:28:15 You should watch.
00:28:16 You should watch.
00:28:17 Ben, you should add him on Twitter.
00:28:19 We're still weird.
00:28:20 I got the inside scoop, Tuck.
00:28:23 You do.
00:28:24 Hey, Tuck.
00:28:25 It's weird how he picked Christian.
00:28:27 If he didn't really mention him much at all is like, why pick Christian out of like anybody
00:28:34 else?
00:28:35 Literally just because it was like trending on Twitter and it was like, oh, this is just
00:28:39 some easy thing I can say for like five seconds without having to like formulate an argument.
00:28:43 You know what I mean?
00:28:44 Yeah.
00:28:46 It's just so weird to me how many people are like, I never even heard of CWC before this
00:28:53 week.
00:28:54 And I'm like, damn, you people aren't as online as me, I guess.
00:28:57 Yeah.
00:28:58 I guess.
00:28:59 It makes perfect sense to me.
00:29:01 It's kind of like a really weird internet thing that you have to have been using internet
00:29:07 for a long time to be fair.
00:29:09 It's like, I have a, it's hard for me to even understand like how quote unquote mainstream
00:29:14 it is.
00:29:15 But like, I don't expect everyone to have like a deep knowledge of Christianry, but I do
00:29:18 expect someone who's been online for a long time to have like heard of Sonichu.
00:29:21 It's a pretty like not seen one image with the medallion ever in their whole life.
00:29:26 Like it's a pretty widespread.
00:29:28 I remember only ever hearing about Christian and Sonichu from Ben, not from the lecture,
00:29:35 but from just talking.
00:29:36 I hadn't heard about it until that point.
00:29:40 People in my discord were telling me that I should, that I should call it, that I shouldn't
00:29:44 call it a Sonichu lecture, that I should call it a Chris Chan lecture because the name
00:29:49 Chris Chan is more recognizable than Sonichu.
00:29:52 And I thought that was so bizarre.
00:29:54 At this point now, that's probably true, but that didn't used to be true.
00:29:57 No, to me, Chris Chan is the creator of Sonichu.
00:30:02 Like that's, that's who they are first and foremost and everything else is like,
00:30:06 I like about those lectures that they are looking at it through the lens of Sonichu,
00:30:10 which is the only real reason you should be interested in Chris Chan.
00:30:14 You know what I mean?
00:30:15 Like you shouldn't be like, oh, I want to troll this person.
00:30:17 You should be like, oh, I want to see this weird thing they made.
00:30:19 You know what I mean?
00:30:20 People, people asked me in the, in the comments, like, are you going to do,
00:30:23 are you going to do a lecture, a 103?
00:30:25 And I'm like, what would I do it on?
00:30:27 I talked about the whole comic.
00:30:28 The comic is over.
00:30:29 Literally just bait them and be like, do Sonichu 103 and get those clicks.
00:30:33 And it's just like one, like a couple like minutes on the remainder of the special issues.
00:30:38 And then the rest is just summarizing slime and punishment.
00:30:41 Maybe you never know.
00:30:43 Maybe it might be Radcon 5, baby.
00:30:46 There might be more Sonichu coming out of prison.
00:30:50 Yeah, we don't technically know that Sonichu is over.
00:30:53 I saw some people saying like, oh, it's over at this point, but we don't know necessarily.
00:30:58 I mean, I don't know.
00:30:59 I mean, I'm not necessarily saying we're going to get more.
00:31:01 So we'll see.
00:31:02 We might get the prison arc.
00:31:04 I think this, this might be the most like a new and like more productive era.
00:31:09 You know, we had a Sonichu Dark Age for a while there.
00:31:12 There was no Sonichu.
00:31:13 Right.
00:31:14 Maybe now we'll get more than ever because Chris will just have like, what else is she going to do in?
00:31:18 I don't think she'll end up in prison.
00:31:19 I think she'll end up in an institution or something.
00:31:21 Even in an institution or you're in prison, they let you have crayons there apparently.
00:31:25 Those are some of the only things you're allowed to draw with because they don't want you having sharp things.
00:31:29 This is the long game.
00:31:30 Chris was preparing for this whole time.
00:31:31 It all comes back as full circle.
00:31:34 You start as a child when you're drawing with crayons and then you end as an adult in prison and you're only allowed to do that.
00:31:40 That's why she never got more advanced.
00:31:41 She knew.
00:31:42 Right.
00:31:43 This is going to happen eventually.
00:31:44 She knew.
00:31:45 She knew it was going to come back to this.
00:31:47 You saw her in her mind.
00:31:49 She used Future Sight.
00:31:50 Just like she used Future Sight to avoid being raped by her son, Sonichu.
00:31:55 In issue 13, she used Future Sight to see that this was going to happen.
00:31:59 Honestly, I mean, I don't know.
00:32:01 It's like part of me feels weird going back and trying to look at an old F-shoes of Sonichu and laugh at them,
00:32:06 but there's some things that are still so funny.
00:32:08 It's just like that one panel where he's like,
00:32:10 Begged your pardon, miss, but nice rack or whatever.
00:32:14 Oh, Blake.
00:32:15 It's so fucking funny.
00:32:16 Blake.
00:32:17 Yeah, Blake.
00:32:18 Confidential Christie.
00:32:19 Thanks, Blake.
00:32:20 Don't get any fucking ideas.
00:32:23 They all just want to fuck her.
00:32:25 They all just want to fuck her.
00:32:27 Of course.
00:32:28 Wouldn't you?
00:32:29 Of course.
00:32:30 Of course.
00:32:31 It is one of those weird things where it's like,
00:32:33 God, just because of how obscenely, ridiculously documented every aspect of Christine's life was,
00:32:38 there are a million red flags in hindsight,
00:32:40 and there are a million, a million people have pointed out things like there.
00:32:44 You know, Chris is really weirdly affectionate with Barb.
00:32:47 It's like, hmm, yeah.
00:32:48 There was a, this was like months ago,
00:32:51 but there was a tweet she made that was like,
00:32:53 it was like apropos of nothing.
00:32:55 She made a tweet that was like,
00:32:56 Yes, I have slept in my mother's bed,
00:32:59 but only sleeping, only sleeping.
00:33:02 Have a good and safe day.
00:33:04 Lightning bolt, blue heart, lightning bolt.
00:33:06 Let's talk about a red flag.
00:33:07 I was like, hmm, yeah.
00:33:09 Like, hmm, my tweet about how I only slept and did nothing else in my mother's bed
00:33:17 is raising a lot of questions that were already answered by my tweet.
00:33:21 I don't, I don't see what the problem is.
00:33:23 Some people just have to take things out of context.
00:33:26 I know.
00:33:27 Yeah, sometimes it's better to take something out of context.
00:33:31 That's, I just, that was like months and months ago.
00:33:34 That was like earlier in the year.
00:33:36 It's, might genuinely have been unrelated.
00:33:39 Well, I can't, I can't say I'm too surprised,
00:33:41 honestly, knowing the history of Chris,
00:33:44 it's kind of par for the course, I guess.
00:33:50 This is what I said.
00:33:51 Not really.
00:33:52 I'm just saying by Ben, which is that.
00:33:54 It's a little stranger than anything that's happened before.
00:33:57 Yeah.
00:33:58 I would say.
00:33:59 I kind of thought Chris was over.
00:34:00 I thought we were entering the boring twilight years of just boring commissions
00:34:04 and all sorts of other weird, you know, nonsense.
00:34:07 And yeah, honestly, I don't want to get too into it,
00:34:11 because actually I'm on the same page as you, Ben,
00:34:13 which is I saw there's like more lore about some Chris being manipulated.
00:34:16 And I was like, I don't even want to, I don't want to read this.
00:34:18 It seems too, it seems too upsetting.
00:34:20 I just don't want to get into it.
00:34:21 I'll let everyone else take care of this.
00:34:23 I've seen a bunch of it.
00:34:24 And I'm like, I think it's like, yeah, that seems plausible.
00:34:27 Sure.
00:34:28 I believe Chris might be manipulated, but like.
00:34:31 It doesn't absolve responsibility or anything.
00:34:33 It's just like another factor.
00:34:35 Another thing that's going to be complicating this whole ordeal.
00:34:38 Chris has been, Chris has been manipulated into doing very,
00:34:42 very bizarre and like harmful things.
00:34:46 Hardly anyone could possibly be on the record as much as Christine
00:34:50 as like being easily manipulatable and like having just like on record
00:34:54 is doing like being tricked into doing all sorts of ridiculous things.
00:34:57 So I mean, again, I'm not saying absolves responsibility.
00:35:00 I'm just saying it's another thing to make it more complicated.
00:35:03 But blackmailed for thousands of dollars by someone telling her
00:35:07 that a laser on the moon was going to blow up quick bill.
00:35:11 It was literally a thing that happened.
00:35:15 So not nothing is off the table.
00:35:17 I don't understand.
00:35:18 Why do they think financially extorting was going to be the best option
00:35:23 for, you know, ruining Christine's life?
00:35:25 Like that's just a weird saga for me.
00:35:28 I think they just wanted money.
00:35:29 They were just like, hey, we can just get some money from this person.
00:35:35 Lol.
00:35:36 OK.
00:35:37 You could just get a job.
00:35:39 It's not an epic troll, guys.
00:35:40 You could spend months trolling this fucking weirdo
00:35:46 and manipulating them and gaslighting them until you can get their fucking
00:35:50 like PlayStation online gift cards or whatever.
00:35:54 Or you just get a fucking job.
00:35:56 It's like, OK, so these people really in their mind, the idea guys
00:36:00 and whatever this new chick is, they in their mind like,
00:36:02 I'm really owning Christine by spending hours and hours in my life,
00:36:06 literally like my life every day and feeding into her delusions
00:36:10 and just being, you know, it's like you're wasting your own life.
00:36:13 You know what I mean?
00:36:14 Like I've seen like chat logs leak and they're like, they're very long.
00:36:17 You know what I mean?
00:36:18 I mean, Christine just wants to talk about lots of bullshit.
00:36:20 So you have to do a lot of just entertaining.
00:36:22 I mean, if the rumors are to be believed, the new girl is just like a sadist
00:36:27 who just likes to torture people
00:36:29 and wanted Chris to kill herself eventually
00:36:32 and was playing the long game to get Chris to commit suicide just for fun.
00:36:36 There's a lot of psychos on the Internet.
00:36:38 It's a scary place to be honest.
00:36:40 And yeah, it's kind of sad that someone would target Christine
00:36:43 just because how famous she is.
00:36:45 Basically, I would assume that's the main reason just like, you know.
00:36:50 How famous and how famously vulnerable.
00:36:54 If you've been using the Internet as long as I have none of this is surprising.
00:36:59 Right.
00:37:00 Just the kinds of people that are out there.
00:37:01 Yeah, me and Gamer, we're old friends on.
00:37:05 We go back to the LP days and we just, we've seen it all.
00:37:09 We've seen it all.
00:37:10 We've seen all the horrible.
00:37:11 I mean, even like something like that exists out there.
00:37:14 It's just sort of, it's sort of stranger when you have like a face
00:37:19 or a name to an actual person who does that sort of stuff.
00:37:22 Like there's always this amorphous like, oh, the dark web,
00:37:25 the worst kinds are on there.
00:37:27 And then you see one in real life in some capacity and you're like, oh my God.
00:37:32 How does somebody end up like that?
00:37:34 It is different when it's like versus like, oh, there are creepy people on the net
00:37:37 versus like this, here's a specific person, all the weird fucked up shit they've done.
00:37:41 And it's like, damn, it's kind of harder to like, you know,
00:37:43 pretend they don't exist or whatever when, you know, I know what they are.
00:37:46 You know what I mean?
00:37:47 But I don't know.
00:37:50 Well, there was a time when the regular internet was basically the dark web
00:37:55 and the average forum was like a four-shand board, you know?
00:38:01 Yeah, the internet used to be a lot meaner in general to the point where,
00:38:05 I mean, there was this weirdly like lighthearted element to it all,
00:38:08 but I don't know, yeah, like the idea of harassing people and stuff.
00:38:11 I mean, a lot of this harassment to Chris Chan back in the day was like,
00:38:15 not even seen as that malicious.
00:38:17 I mean, there are obviously a few malicious actors,
00:38:19 but a lot of it was just people were like, lols, it's just trolling.
00:38:21 It's just trolling for the lols.
00:38:23 It's all been agglomerated onto like, you know, individual, like social media sites.
00:38:29 It's all been like collected into, you know, like private platforms, right?
00:38:36 Instead of the discourse being all spread out across like forums and message boards
00:38:42 and private servers and stuff.
00:38:45 Right. People in general are just less psycho on the internet now that people,
00:38:48 you know, a lot of people tie to real names and identities to their online identity,
00:38:52 whereas back in the day it was like everybody, you can't be using your real name online
00:38:56 or you're going to get kidnapped and killed.
00:38:58 So everyone has to do everything anonymously, you know what I mean?
00:39:03 And now everybody just willingly offers the government all their personal information.
00:39:07 Yeah, now they want to make it a crime to be anonymous on the internet.
00:39:11 There's like people like, we see these trolls hiding behind their anonymity,
00:39:15 like all the, you know, like the blue check marks on Twitter.
00:39:17 They're like, they shouldn't be allowed to be anonymous and not,
00:39:20 because they can make fun of me and my face, but it's like, I don't know.
00:39:23 I don't want anonymity to go away, but I do understand there's people who abuse it,
00:39:27 but I don't think the solution is making it so everyone has to use the real name all the time.
00:39:31 It's okay. The vaccine microchip will automatically be uploading your data to your Twitter account soon.
00:39:40 It will upload your DNA to your profile picture.
00:39:43 As soon as Bill Gates is going to wait until 99% vaccine saturation,
00:39:49 then he's going to push the big red upload button, and then the blue check marks will be safe.
00:39:56 The blue check marks are the only people who are going to be spared in like the post-apocalypse.
00:40:01 It's like every single other person is going to be purged.
00:40:03 Only the most valuable people recognized by their blue check mark will survive.
00:40:07 It's the mark of the beast. It's the mark of the beast.
00:40:11 Mark of the best, more like.
00:40:14 Yeah, exactly.
00:40:16 I got a pee. Sorry, I'll be back in a minute.
00:40:19 Excuse me. Pardon me, bad time.
00:40:21 All right, everybody, now we can finally shit-talk Ben, get all of our hot Ben takes out.
00:40:27 Hot Ben Saint takes out.
00:40:29 Can you believe that Ben Saint doesn't have 30 plus tabs open on his web browser at any given time?
00:40:36 What a dork. How does he even use the internet if he doesn't have that many tabs?
00:40:40 He's barely using it.
00:40:41 He needs at least that many.
00:40:43 My favorite thing about Ben Saint is his Twitter timeline.
00:40:48 It's basically just him listing all the people he hates.
00:40:52 Somebody has to dab on them.
00:40:55 I saw a series of tweets the other day where the entire day was just him tweeting,
00:41:01 I hate this guy and I hate this other guy and I hate that guy.
00:41:05 That's our Ben. He hates a lot of people.
00:41:09 There just wasn't enough negativity on the internet.
00:41:11 So Ben was like, you know, someone really needs to close the gap between the endless positivity on the web
00:41:17 and someone who's just solely focused on the negative.
00:41:20 There was too much discourse on Twitter.
00:41:22 There were too many people having conversations and someone needed to come in and be a little agitator,
00:41:27 a little disruptor and throw a wrench into the works and be like, you know what?
00:41:31 I'm going to say what nobody else is going to say, which is that some of these people online suck.
00:41:36 And you know what? He's a hero for saying it.
00:41:38 Here's a list of all the content creators I don't like.
00:41:42 And why I don't like them and how they can be better.
00:41:45 That's the, you know, people are afraid to tell it like it is.
00:41:49 They just want to sugarcoat everything.
00:41:51 They're too afraid to constantly be getting into arguments with everyone who approaches them on Twitter.
00:41:57 I think our boy does though.
00:41:59 Gamers Tavern was following it with silence because he loves everyone.
00:42:04 Yeah, exactly.
00:42:07 No, no, no, it's all good.
00:42:09 It's all good.
00:42:10 If you're listening to this episode right now, definitely do not bother Ben Saints on Twitter
00:42:14 because he will definitely listen to this part back and know what's happening.
00:42:18 Yep.
00:42:19 We're all fucked.
00:42:20 Nah, he'll never.
00:42:22 There's no way he'll ever listen to me say fuck Ben Saint, more like Duck Ben Saint, more like Duck Saint, more like Quack.
00:42:32 Eleazar, make sure that Ben Saint has been thoroughly dabbed on and that he never knows about this.
00:42:37 And if you ever find out about it, it's your fault.
00:42:40 There's so many fictional ducks. I'll never know them all. I'm actually upset looking at like the page of fictional ducks isn't that long, but there's still so many I've never even heard of before.
00:42:58 I actually know most of the video games.
00:43:00 I'm back and I just want you to know that you're all great chums and pals and I'm just glad to share my good times.
00:43:11 Share some positive vibes with all of you here on the Procrastinator's podcast.
00:43:16 I'm so glad you said that, Ben, because we weren't shit talking to you the whole time you were gone or anything like that.
00:43:20 I know. I assume so.
00:43:22 Yeah, we definitely weren't doing that at all.
00:43:24 What else? Why would I think anything differently?
00:43:28 What did I miss?
00:43:30 I don't know. We're back on the ducks.
00:43:32 We're like, I don't know. I think this happened before the episode started.
00:43:36 We accidentally pulled up a list of fictional ducks on Wikipedia and we can't stop.
00:43:40 Well, it was no accident. We deliberately wanted to talk about ducks.
00:43:44 It was a guided discussion towards ducks and Darkwing duck and a lot of ducks.
00:43:48 Doctor Quack from Sonic the Hedgehog.
00:43:50 Oh my God. I remember Doctor Quack. Jesus Christ.
00:43:53 I don't.
00:43:56 That's an interesting example because it's a non-game example.
00:44:00 Yeah, it was from...
00:44:01 I actually don't remember Doctor Quack.
00:44:03 That's from the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, right?
00:44:05 Yeah.
00:44:06 I like, at the bottom of the page by the video game section, it has Bruce the Duck from the Atari 2600 video game Duck Attack.
00:44:15 I don't know why, just the image of this super low-poly duck.
00:44:19 It's just a duck.
00:44:20 It's a low-poly looking, but with the description, with the Wikipedia description,
00:44:25 something about that cracks me up here. I'm gonna post it in chat so people will understand what I'm talking about later.
00:44:31 Bruce the Duck is just a duck.
00:44:33 You know what they say, life comes at you fast like Sonic on a first date.
00:44:39 Exactly. Except Sonic doesn't date. He's an incel.
00:44:42 No, he's a vol-cell.
00:44:44 Sonic doesn't come in. He's a vol-cell.
00:44:47 He could get laid, but he would never.
00:44:51 He would never do that.
00:44:52 He would never dare do that to me.
00:44:54 He would never betray me like that.
00:44:55 Dating would mean slowing down in life, and we all know he would never do that.
00:44:59 He's too much of a shan to get laid.
00:45:02 That's the opposite of like, celibate the word.
00:45:06 Like, to have had sex in a celibate.
00:45:12 No, that's not it.
00:45:14 Just laid.
00:45:15 Based.
00:45:16 So like, vol-laid or inlaid?
00:45:19 In that one, in the Doom episode of Action Button, Tim Rogers is giving a bunch of lists of like,
00:45:29 how like everyone I knew in college had watched the animation for Nights of the Round from Final Fantasy VII,
00:45:37 and he says like, it doesn't matter if you were like, loser or Chad, virgin or laid.
00:45:43 So that's the dichotomy.
00:45:45 I see.
00:45:47 I don't think it's true that everybody watched that animation.
00:45:52 That seems a little strange.
00:45:54 He said that like, he would be like, hey, I'm playing, you've heard of Final Fantasy VII,
00:46:01 and they're like, yeah, I've seen that poster of Cloud on the motorcycle,
00:46:05 and they're like, okay, cool, we'll just, hey, look at this cool summon I can do.
00:46:10 Look at how these knights, and they go, wow.
00:46:13 It is a cool attack animation.
00:46:15 I'll give them some credit.
00:46:17 I appreciate when Tim Rogers tells me about video games in between monologuing about his life for three hours at a time.
00:46:24 Yeah.
00:46:26 He is a, what a windbag.
00:46:31 What a bitch.
00:46:33 He's one of those people where it's like, oh yeah, well, of course you can have an interesting YouTube channel
00:46:38 because you've done all these cool things in your life, like go to Japan and translate games.
00:46:42 What am I supposed to talk about?
00:46:44 Just being a fucking loser who makes YouTube videos and hasn't done those things?
00:46:48 I brought up Tim Rogers last, I think after the show last week, I brought him up and I showed,
00:46:53 and I mentioned him to Tom, and Tom looked up a picture of him,
00:46:57 and Tom was like, oh no, I don't like the look of this guy.
00:47:02 You know, sometimes you see a guy on the Internet,
00:47:05 and it's not fair to judge a book by its cover, but you just see him and you're just like, I don't like that guy.
00:47:11 Ben's immediate defense, and I will defer to his expertise since he's more familiar,
00:47:15 that it was not the most flattering quote though.
00:47:17 I had that reaction with pro Jared.
00:47:20 He might be a nice guy, I don't know, but I just don't like his fucking face,
00:47:25 which isn't very polite or nice to say, but I just have had that reaction.
00:47:29 I see him in a thumbnail and I'm like, I'm not clicking that video, you piece of shit.
00:47:32 How dare you ask me to click this video by making a thumbnail?
00:47:36 For whatever reason, the women seem to really like him.
00:47:40 Yeah, the only thing I know about pro Jared is that he got in that controversy.
00:47:44 I can't even remember how long ago that was.
00:47:46 They completely lost track of linear time.
00:47:48 That was before fucking COVID, wasn't it?
00:47:50 Yeah, it must have been.
00:47:52 So it must have been like early 2020 or like late 2019 or something?
00:47:56 I think it was like 2019 or 2018.
00:47:59 Oh my God, that shit was so funny.
00:48:03 That shit was so funny.
00:48:05 Bad things happen to people who aren't me.
00:48:07 I remember celebrating when I was watching his follower count drop.
00:48:12 I thought it was so funny.
00:48:14 Watching him go down from a million subs to 750k.
00:48:19 But then I ended up hating other people involved in that situation more than I hated him about it.
00:48:26 It wasn't like it was all him or whatever.
00:48:28 I think Bethead Bernie or something had a good video where it was like pro Jared.
00:48:33 It wasn't just being a creepy.
00:48:35 Some people lie to him and some other bullshit.
00:48:37 I don't really want to rehash it all and I don't remember it properly.
00:48:40 Just for the record, I'm not putting him on blast.
00:48:43 I literally do not hate the guy.
00:48:44 I just think he has a fucking weird face.
00:48:46 Bethead Bernie asked me for my input about that video.
00:48:50 One of my tweets is in that video.
00:48:53 It's in some point.
00:48:55 It's screen-shotted.
00:48:57 Your take on the Sitch.
00:48:59 That was the first thing that happened as soon as the fucking pro Jared drama dropped.
00:49:03 As soon as the Christian drama dropped, everyone was like,
00:49:05 what's Ben Sainz take on this?
00:49:07 It's the most important take to know about.
00:49:10 The only one.
00:49:11 All you need.
00:49:12 And that's all you need.
00:49:14 Pro Jared's face is like smoothed out grumbo.
00:49:19 Is there any way to describe it?
00:49:21 He's got kind of a smooth face, but it's lumpy as well.
00:49:26 What are you talking about?
00:49:28 The way he wins.
00:49:29 I don't know.
00:49:30 It's kind of wet, but in a dry way.
00:49:33 It's kind of like a bird-like snout.
00:49:35 No.
00:49:36 The skin is like, he takes care of his skin.
00:49:40 He takes care of his hair, but he's got a lumpy, weirdo face.
00:49:44 And bulging eyes.
00:49:46 He does kind of have bug eyes, yeah.
00:49:49 At least be thankful that you haven't seen his leaked nudes.
00:49:54 Oh, I think...
00:49:55 I think they saw the editor version.
00:49:57 It's not a pretty sight.
00:49:58 I might have seen his dick.
00:49:59 I saw a censored image.
00:50:04 I laughed.
00:50:05 I laughed.
00:50:06 If you're an internet content creator and you're like taking pictures of yourself like that,
00:50:10 you're basically asking for them to get leaked to the public.
00:50:12 Yeah, it's a time bomb.
00:50:13 I'll say.
00:50:14 It's a matter of a way.
00:50:15 You can do it.
00:50:16 I'm not saying you're not allowed to do that, but just be aware.
00:50:18 Knowing that it's going to happen, even.
00:50:21 Just make that your brand, if that happens.
00:50:23 Fuck it.
00:50:24 Yeah, just have an open door policy.
00:50:26 Just like, yep.
00:50:27 You have your video game review shown at the end.
00:50:30 Now for the cock of the week.
00:50:32 He should have leaned into it and been like, yeah.
00:50:34 I'm cool, progerited.
00:50:36 I'm going to have lots of sex with people now.
00:50:38 I'm going to be the sex game reviewer.
00:50:40 I'm going to be the sex YouTuber now.
00:50:45 I'm going to be the gaming YouTuber.
00:50:47 I'm opening up my secondary channel on porn hub.
00:50:49 So if you guys want to come check that out,
00:50:52 here's the link in the description.
00:50:55 I think he's still really popular and successful.
00:50:58 He's not like a top triple A tier YouTuber,
00:51:01 but he's pretty popular, pretty successful.
00:51:03 So I don't feel that bad making fun of him.
00:51:05 In the long run, it didn't really hurt him that much.
00:51:09 There's a lot of people getting these huge fucking controversies
00:51:11 and traumas and people are like, oh, he's ruined.
00:51:14 His channel is over, but no.
00:51:16 It takes a lot to really ruin your channel.
00:51:20 You'd have to be trying on purpose or something.
00:51:22 Unless you literally go to jail, usually it's okay.
00:51:30 Even then, sometimes these fucking Minecraft predators
00:51:33 will come back and then they'll just still start making videos
00:51:36 and their fan base is so young and stupid
00:51:38 that even if they lose 50% of their viewer base,
00:51:40 that's still enough for them.
00:51:42 There's two names that are coming up in my head
00:51:45 relating to this, Onision and Shane Dawson.
00:51:48 I don't know whether they're the same guy or very similar.
00:51:51 Are they both like sex freaks or is just one of them?
00:51:54 Wait, Shane Dawson isn't like a sex freak, is he?
00:51:58 He's not like a groom or anything.
00:52:00 He's just kind of an asshole, right?
00:52:03 Am I wrong?
00:52:04 I don't know.
00:52:05 He has a bunch of weird drama.
00:52:06 I'm not really sure about all the Shane Dawson drama,
00:52:08 honestly, I kind of miss both of that.
00:52:10 They strike me as like people who've been horrifically canceled
00:52:13 because of things they did absolutely,
00:52:16 and I don't know whether they've come back from that.
00:52:19 You can't cancel someone who's as big as Shane Dawson.
00:52:24 Right, you get to a certain point and it's really hard
00:52:27 to truly cancel someone.
00:52:29 Again, you can make them lose popularity or whatever.
00:52:31 That's fine, but to make them fully go away,
00:52:34 if they're determined to stick around, it's tough.
00:52:38 I've seen at least one popular YouTuber get...
00:52:41 They do look exactly the same.
00:52:43 Completely canceled.
00:52:45 There was Zero, the Smash Bros.
00:52:50 He used to be one of the best Smash players in the world
00:52:54 for Smash 4.
00:52:56 Right.
00:52:57 Oh yeah, yeah.
00:52:58 There's a lot of Smash community people who have gotten...
00:53:01 Oh, what's sorry about Leffen?
00:53:03 Are you talking about Hax and Leffen?
00:53:05 No, just a different guy who's been accused of...
00:53:09 I don't know if it was grooming or some shit, but...
00:53:12 I heard there was a lot of grooming going on
00:53:15 in the Smash community for a while.
00:53:17 It's ironic that there was so much grooming going on
00:53:19 because there was little to no self-grooming.
00:53:21 They never took showers.
00:53:26 Look at these freaks, they're exactly the same guy.
00:53:28 I do have that sort of...
00:53:30 I'm a YouTube pretty boy face bullshit going on.
00:53:33 I have no idea how they're both still around,
00:53:35 but I think it's...
00:53:37 I think younger Shane Dawson looks even more like Onision.
00:53:42 I think you could find even more similar pictures of these too.
00:53:44 Yeah, another thing about these guys,
00:53:46 I'm not really that much of an expert on them.
00:53:48 I think I've seen a couple YouTube documentary type videos on them,
00:53:51 but they've been around for ages.
00:53:53 When you've been on the platform for this long,
00:53:55 people will have these laundry lists of controversies.
00:54:00 They never end, so it's like,
00:54:02 is this latest thing going to be the thing to cancel them?
00:54:05 I don't think so.
00:54:07 At some point, your career just becomes like responding to
00:54:11 people making videos about how you are a monster
00:54:15 and need to be canceled.
00:54:17 But randomly, there's a lot of people who want to watch those
00:54:19 like apology videos.
00:54:20 There's always get lots of views,
00:54:22 so it's like profitable to be constantly apologizing.
00:54:26 There should be a chance where the first video is an apology video
00:54:30 and then every video after that is also an apology video.
00:54:33 I'm so sorry for never making a video up until right now.
00:54:41 There should be a gimmick.
00:54:43 There should be a fucking like priest YouTuber,
00:54:47 like a real priest who does like,
00:54:49 what is the thing, where you go in the box and you say,
00:54:52 oh, it's confessional.
00:54:54 Confession booth series YouTube show.
00:54:57 I'd watch that.
00:54:59 It doesn't look like a good gimmick.
00:55:01 It's hidden camera confessions where he just like records
00:55:03 everybody who comes in and confesses their sins
00:55:05 and then exposes them.
00:55:09 Completely goes against the idea of like the confession box,
00:55:12 like the secretive private thing.
00:55:15 Yeah, but it's for content though.
00:55:17 It's for content.
00:55:18 The church is running out of funding.
00:55:20 I gotta have a baby.
00:55:22 I gotta have a baby so that I can raise that baby to be a sinner
00:55:26 and then I can record my child in the confessional
00:55:30 confessing his sins to the priest and then upload it to YouTube
00:55:33 for content.
00:55:34 You just stream the confessional all day.
00:55:36 Yeah, I was gonna say Twitch.
00:55:37 And then in between people like coming and leaving,
00:55:39 it's like, all right, we're gonna fucking read some doughnos.
00:55:41 It's like America's funniest confessional.
00:55:45 Someone's like confessing in their booth,
00:55:47 like it's like, Father, I'm so sorry.
00:55:49 I hit someone with my car and the priest is like,
00:55:51 can we get some Monka S in chat?
00:55:53 This is not on open guys.
00:55:55 Can we get some Monka S?
00:55:57 Yeah, of course.
00:56:00 I like the idea that it's not like some third party,
00:56:03 put the secret camera there.
00:56:04 Like the priest is the Twitch streamer.
00:56:06 Exactly, exactly.
00:56:07 Like he's like pogging at the camera.
00:56:09 He's like, oh.
00:56:13 It's just like, you know, there's like two sides of the confessional.
00:56:16 There's a little sliding door that opens so you can talk to him.
00:56:19 Father, I'm sorry, I sinned.
00:56:20 He like closes it, turns on like the RGB lights and stuff.
00:56:23 It has like this fucking gamer setup and turns it back off
00:56:25 when it's back up, keeps talking.
00:56:26 He's like, I cheated on my girlfriend with her sister
00:56:29 and he goes like, oh, based.
00:56:31 Oh, like can we get, smash the like shit, like come and chat?
00:56:34 No, no, no.
00:56:35 Like the idea is that it's a secret.
00:56:37 Like he doesn't, he doesn't tell them he's live streaming
00:56:40 and when he pogs, he's like silently pogging,
00:56:42 but they can't see him through the thing.
00:56:43 He's like, pogging to chat.
00:56:44 The camera's on his side.
00:56:45 And then they're hearing all of like this, the confession.
00:56:48 He's like, oh, pog base.
00:56:50 Someone just realizes it's the perfect way to get content.
00:56:53 These people are just coming in and telling all these embarrassing stories.
00:56:56 Like where else are you going to get that?
00:56:57 This is all, it's all been, all these confessions before
00:57:00 they've all just been wasted content.
00:57:01 We're just, we're just leaving money on the table.
00:57:03 We have like thousands of years of wasted content
00:57:06 in terms of confessions.
00:57:08 If you think about it.
00:57:09 As rid of all these ideas are.
00:57:11 The problem is, I think this might be illegal.
00:57:13 If you think about it.
00:57:14 That's clearly never stopped the Catholic Church before.
00:57:16 If you think about it, all of human history
00:57:18 prior to the invention of like the written word
00:57:21 was just wasted content.
00:57:23 It really was, it really was.
00:57:25 Imagine having a life experience and not making content out of it.
00:57:28 What a waste.
00:57:29 I would rather not.
00:57:30 I would rather not.
00:57:31 Imagine not having thousands of people watch you through your eyes
00:57:34 and get like advertised to.
00:57:36 Imagine that didn't happen.
00:57:38 I mentioned like, like 5,000 years ago, like around Stonehenge
00:57:41 they're like passing down their songs to a world tradition.
00:57:44 And one guy's just like, what's the point?
00:57:46 We're not even monetizing this.
00:57:47 We're not even getting any doughnuts.
00:57:49 We're not getting any doughnuts, bro.
00:57:51 Oh my God.
00:57:52 Oh my God.
00:57:53 Imagine, what a great conversation with a friend.
00:57:56 No, no, no.
00:57:57 Imagine with like a great fucking Isekai show
00:57:59 that would be like a fucking streamer gets sent back in time
00:58:02 to like prehistoric days where there's no fucking content.
00:58:05 All he's doing is like, he's like,
00:58:07 he's like experiencing all these like fucking like historical events.
00:58:11 He's like, I can't fucking vlog any of this.
00:58:13 I would love for there to be like a Dr. Stone
00:58:16 where he's like trying to teach these cavemen.
00:58:18 Alright, so this is when we have to start a fake beef
00:58:20 and you're the heel which means you're the bad guy
00:58:22 and we're going to have to start a whole rap battle
00:58:24 that goes on between you guys
00:58:25 and then we're going to do a boxing match
00:58:27 and he's just like trying to explain the complicated
00:58:29 like setting up a huge beef or whatever.
00:58:31 Yeah, the first thing that comes back
00:58:34 is not like humanity infrastructure
00:58:36 like countries or like society.
00:58:38 It's vlogging.
00:58:40 That's the first thing that we need.
00:58:42 All those Islanders, like they're building the Moai statues
00:58:45 and there's like, I know these seem totally like pointless now
00:58:47 but like hundreds of years from now
00:58:49 they're going to invent this thing called the Internet
00:58:51 and then we can stream these
00:58:53 and then we can, then we can, we'll get doughnuts.
00:58:56 Like, stream like aesthetic statue, not moving.
00:58:59 Yes, yes, like this is for content.
00:59:01 This is for content.
00:59:03 These are, these are too many good ideas.
00:59:06 We need to pay people.
00:59:08 Yeah, Aliza, cut this all out.
00:59:10 We got to keep you close to the chest.
00:59:12 Listeners, if any of you do this, you owe us a cut.
00:59:16 Don't even think about inventing a time machine
00:59:18 and going back and inventing streaming.
00:59:20 If you even think about doing that.
00:59:22 Going back in time and inventing Stonehenge.
00:59:25 It's like, it's like those, those movies.
00:59:27 Livestreaming the building of Stonehenge.
00:59:29 Or like, oh, like the kid goes back in the past
00:59:32 and he's like, whoa, what the fuck?
00:59:34 There's horses and shit.
00:59:36 Where's the video games?
00:59:37 Then he teaches like the princess about,
00:59:40 I don't know, like skateboarding or whatever.
00:59:43 But like a modern version of that would be like
00:59:46 the kid going back in time
00:59:48 and then teaching them about like,
00:59:50 I don't know, Mario Kart.
00:59:52 I would love like a training montage.
00:59:54 Like this is how you make a pog face.
00:59:56 Or like practicing their pogs.
00:59:58 That's kind of all to this point.
01:00:00 Bill and Ted, but instead of a history report,
01:00:04 they go back to the live stream history
01:00:08 because they want to become streamers.
01:00:10 They've dropped out of school to become streamers
01:00:12 and this is how they're going to get the big scoop.
01:00:14 They go back to when Twitch was called JustinTV
01:00:16 and then they start an account.
01:00:18 Honestly.
01:00:20 I remember JustinTV.
01:00:22 Imagine if you could just go back to when the internet was new
01:00:26 and just upload the same videos that you make now.
01:00:29 You'd be huge.
01:00:30 It would be so fucking easy to go viral
01:00:32 like knowing everything you know today.
01:00:34 It would be literally like, you know, the sports almanac
01:00:36 from Back to the Future part two or you can win it every bet.
01:00:38 But you just can predict every YouTube trend
01:00:40 before it happens and you'd be making this worst clickbait garbage.
01:00:42 You would have such terrible tools to use, though.
01:00:45 Imagine having to do your shit in Windows Movie Maker
01:00:47 and just be like, oh, God, my fucking Pentium 4
01:00:50 is struggling to fucking edit this
01:00:52 and I can only upload in 360p.
01:00:54 Google's not good enough. I can't get all my footage.
01:00:56 I can't just rip it. There's no tools to use it yet.
01:00:58 It really was a fucking nightmare back then.
01:01:00 Now you bring your bad memories.
01:01:02 I go back to 1999 and I'm on Usenet forums
01:01:06 and I'm like, hey, bros, listen, years from now,
01:01:10 some person is going to put Sonic the Hedgehog
01:01:14 and this new thing called Pokemon.
01:01:17 They're going to combine them into one guy
01:01:19 and make a comic about it and you're really going to
01:01:23 and you're not going to believe what happens after that.
01:01:26 I love the idea of like a John Teeter
01:01:28 who just goes back to warn people about Sonichu
01:01:30 and nothing important.
01:01:31 No warnings about 9-11 or anything.
01:01:34 No, no, just because no one would listen.
01:01:37 No one would listen to that.
01:01:39 I miss like you have like a time machine,
01:01:41 like you give a kid a time machine and they're like, wow,
01:01:43 I can go at any point in history and they just go back
01:01:45 a couple of years to get YouTube famous.
01:01:47 That's the only thing they do with it.
01:01:49 What if you just did that now?
01:01:51 What if you just went on a fucking forum
01:01:53 and just said you were a time traveler and was like,
01:01:55 oh, this new content creator is going to show up.
01:01:57 It's going to be fucking ridiculous.
01:01:58 Then you just wait two years and then you start that account.
01:02:01 You start a prophecy about yourself?
01:02:05 Yeah, you just start like a prophecy about yourself
01:02:08 so you can like get that jumpstart to your career
01:02:10 and just be like, it was this guy predicted it
01:02:12 and now it's shown up, you know,
01:02:14 and you just spanned ignorance the rest of the time.
01:02:16 I love the idea.
01:02:17 Before you even start your streaming career,
01:02:19 people always ask my advice.
01:02:20 I was like, what should I do on YouTube?
01:02:21 I was like, okay, before you even start YouTube,
01:02:22 you need to spend five to 10 years foreshadowing
01:02:24 your channel before it even exists.
01:02:27 You need to be like dropping in some of your forums,
01:02:29 fakingarchive.org results about...
01:02:32 Organic growth doesn't exist anymore.
01:02:34 Therefore, you got to really fucking play the long game.
01:02:38 Right, you have to game the system
01:02:39 by doing the most crazy outlandish stunts possible
01:02:42 and like fake time travel.
01:02:44 That's the only way to get your attention.
01:02:45 And you also got to hope that nobody else
01:02:47 decides to be that person that is foreshadowed.
01:02:50 Oh yeah, nobody can like...
01:02:52 You have to have some specific thing,
01:02:53 otherwise someone can just swoop in and take all your glory.
01:02:56 That was why the John Theater stuff works,
01:02:57 there's so much hyper-specific bullshit
01:02:59 that never even happened,
01:03:00 but like, oh, it sounded legit.
01:03:02 But it can all happen if you're the one controlling it.
01:03:05 You can make sure everything comes true.
01:03:09 Don't even think about starting YouTube channel
01:03:11 if you don't have 10 years worth of deep lore plans.
01:03:14 Worth of prophecy.
01:03:15 Worth of prophecy.
01:03:17 Isn't that basically how you got your start cyber shell?
01:03:22 You've been doing this for quite a while.
01:03:24 Yeah, it was all prophesized back in the day.
01:03:27 That's exactly how I got my start.
01:03:30 I didn't want to be a guy who made videos
01:03:32 that sound like that.
01:03:33 Also, I love the idea...
01:03:34 I love the idea that John Theater,
01:03:35 you know, I dropped some clues here and there.
01:03:37 I love the idea that there's a prophecy,
01:03:39 the prophecy, the chosen one,
01:03:40 and then it's like,
01:03:41 it's like Link Carr in front of a couch.
01:03:43 Like, hey guys,
01:03:44 we were doing this on YouTube.
01:03:45 Oh, it was Doug, it was Doug.
01:03:47 Doug really is the chosen one.
01:03:50 He's like the main character of this timeline.
01:03:53 Yeah.
01:03:54 More like the awesome one.
01:03:57 I saw...
01:04:01 It was a YMS stream clip
01:04:04 about Doug reacting to criticism of the wall.
01:04:08 Oh, right.
01:04:09 I think I saw this.
01:04:10 He has a weirdly good and positive
01:04:11 and wholesome attitude about it.
01:04:13 He has a positive attitude,
01:04:14 but he also just completely
01:04:16 just talks around the actual criticism.
01:04:20 Oh yeah, he'll never engage
01:04:21 in the true substance of the criticisms.
01:04:23 He'll be like,
01:04:24 you know, I'm glad people are talking about it.
01:04:27 It's like, hey,
01:04:28 why did you make it so like confusing
01:04:30 and contradictory and like bad?
01:04:31 And he's like,
01:04:32 I'm just glad people are talking about it.
01:04:34 Right.
01:04:35 He said it in kind of a way like,
01:04:38 oh, I understand those criticisms,
01:04:40 and he sort of lumped that into like
01:04:42 one general thing.
01:04:44 And it's like,
01:04:45 people are always going to dislike
01:04:46 what you do on the internet.
01:04:47 I know that.
01:04:48 I've been on here for a long time.
01:04:49 And everyone's always disliked everything I've done,
01:04:51 so it was just haters.
01:04:52 He clearly doesn't realize
01:04:54 that there's a distinct like confusing aspect
01:04:57 of his video.
01:04:58 He just thinks people don't like it.
01:04:59 And that's just how it is sometimes.
01:05:00 It's just, you know,
01:05:01 no learning capability.
01:05:02 They're always going to have haters.
01:05:03 They're always going to have haters.
01:05:04 They're always dissecting the wall
01:05:05 because it was just,
01:05:06 they were haters.
01:05:07 They're just,
01:05:08 oh, of course,
01:05:09 there's going to be some people who don't like it.
01:05:10 It was like a fascinatingly bad piece of media.
01:05:11 I don't think I understand that.
01:05:12 Yeah.
01:05:13 Like it's not a normal level of criticism
01:05:17 that was being levied.
01:05:18 Like it is a uniquely,
01:05:19 it's like a uniquely bad cultural artifact.
01:05:22 And he's,
01:05:23 yeah,
01:05:24 it's a little disappointing that he's just like,
01:05:25 eh,
01:05:26 eh,
01:05:27 it just rolls right off me.
01:05:28 Like I said,
01:05:29 hey,
01:05:30 I still think he had a good positive attitude
01:05:31 about the whole thing.
01:05:32 There's guys like just going on right now,
01:05:34 like only plays have made a few like Linkara jokes.
01:05:37 And someone like asked Linkara
01:05:38 what he thought about it.
01:05:39 He's like, I don't like it.
01:05:40 I don't think it's funny.
01:05:41 They make their people are calling me the light bringer
01:05:42 and I don't like it.
01:05:43 But that's,
01:05:44 but that is funny.
01:05:45 I know it is funny.
01:05:46 It is funny when people call you the light bringer.
01:05:48 It is funny.
01:05:49 I mean,
01:05:50 I don't know.
01:05:51 Which not funny to him.
01:05:52 Again,
01:05:53 I don't,
01:05:54 just lean into it.
01:05:55 Yeah.
01:05:56 You literally have to lean into it when that's the case.
01:05:57 Like you should literally just be grateful
01:05:58 that people still care who he is after 10 plus years.
01:06:01 You know what I mean?
01:06:02 This is,
01:06:03 this is what I said.
01:06:04 Oh,
01:06:05 absolutely.
01:06:06 Like this is what I said.
01:06:07 I,
01:06:08 I saw,
01:06:09 I saw Nate the other day.
01:06:10 He just like happened to be in town
01:06:11 and like I hung out with him for a day
01:06:12 and we were talking about the PCP stuff
01:06:14 and the,
01:06:15 and the rad con stuff.
01:06:16 And I told him like, you know,
01:06:18 yeah,
01:06:19 the rad con stuff,
01:06:20 it's a year late and like the PCP has like,
01:06:23 you know,
01:06:24 I wouldn't,
01:06:25 I mean imploded is a strong word,
01:06:26 but you know what I mean?
01:06:28 Like it's all,
01:06:29 the whole landscape has changed
01:06:30 and it's really awkward to now just be like,
01:06:32 well,
01:06:33 here's these videos of a totally different PCP
01:06:36 from a completely bygone era.
01:06:38 And I'm just like,
01:06:39 I think that's funny.
01:06:40 It's just,
01:06:41 just lean into it.
01:06:42 Like,
01:06:43 yeah,
01:06:44 like here it is.
01:06:45 It's changed in just what,
01:06:46 18 months or whatever.
01:06:47 Yeah.
01:06:48 Yeah.
01:06:49 Yeah.
01:06:50 I mean,
01:06:51 it was funny seeing the reactions to the music video
01:06:52 when I would,
01:06:53 you mean the,
01:06:54 not the music,
01:06:55 the rap,
01:06:56 the rap,
01:06:57 the rad lecture.
01:06:58 Yeah.
01:06:59 Cause like,
01:07:00 that one in particular was like,
01:07:01 that one was heavily steeped in PCP lore.
01:07:04 You know what I mean?
01:07:05 Like that one was,
01:07:06 yeah,
01:07:07 the OVA will be even more.
01:07:08 It's even more.
01:07:09 Oh my God.
01:07:10 It's going to be that times 10.
01:07:12 The OVA,
01:07:13 age,
01:07:14 like,
01:07:15 people are going to be like,
01:07:16 people don't even remember Brad Garlinghouse at this point.
01:07:19 No,
01:07:20 it was,
01:07:21 it was a,
01:07:22 the saga is over.
01:07:23 The Brad Garlinghouse saga was over when Radcon happened.
01:07:26 It had already been solved.
01:07:29 It was only like,
01:07:31 while the,
01:07:32 the,
01:07:33 the campaign was going,
01:07:34 that like,
01:07:35 it was a thing.
01:07:36 The OVA is going to be like,
01:07:39 it's going to be like,
01:07:41 like a,
01:07:42 a time capsule that you bury in the past and open the future.
01:07:45 And they're like,
01:07:46 Oh, remember that?
01:07:47 Except it was just late.
01:07:49 Only,
01:07:50 only you had to put $31,000 into it.
01:07:53 And the time capsule is a hard drive.
01:07:56 All the footage is on.
01:07:57 It was,
01:07:58 it was like,
01:07:59 it's like a gotcha game that you,
01:08:00 yeah,
01:08:01 you put $31,000 in and then a year and a half later,
01:08:03 you get some,
01:08:05 some videos out.
01:08:06 I can't wait to roll for the PCP dojin.
01:08:09 Oh, I got the OVA instead.
01:08:11 This is my favorite gotcha game.
01:08:13 Just got to keep rolling.
01:08:14 You just got to keep putting those PC pennies into the machine.
01:08:17 That's,
01:08:18 that's,
01:08:19 that's why you don't release it at all.
01:08:20 So even now that it's like post-apocalypse arc or whatever,
01:08:23 you can still tell people,
01:08:24 we still have nuggets of the pre-PCP,
01:08:26 the,
01:08:27 the good days.
01:08:28 We're like the brother gotcha game was on,
01:08:31 was on the,
01:08:32 the PCP discord channel.
01:08:35 It's like,
01:08:36 I'm going to fucking roll for,
01:08:37 for another lecture.
01:08:38 Ah,
01:08:39 branches of yig video again today.
01:08:41 Oh yeah.
01:08:42 The,
01:08:43 the bot was only uploading branches of yig videos for some
01:08:46 reason.
01:08:47 I don't know who,
01:08:48 I don't even know who made the bot.
01:08:49 Yeah.
01:08:50 I was trying to look into it.
01:08:51 I have no idea how to edit it.
01:08:53 Yeah.
01:08:54 I think I know.
01:08:55 Appropriate.
01:08:56 But yeah.
01:08:57 It's confused.
01:08:58 So I just,
01:08:59 An ancient long since gun PCP fan.
01:09:02 Hmm.
01:09:03 And I saw it was,
01:09:04 the,
01:09:05 the bot was going,
01:09:06 the bot was going crazy as a,
01:09:08 as,
01:09:09 as Trixie was surreptitiously,
01:09:11 uh,
01:09:12 like re-uploading stuff from the main channel to the side
01:09:14 channel.
01:09:15 And I like,
01:09:16 I see the feed and I'm like,
01:09:17 these are all,
01:09:18 I don't,
01:09:19 I don't need this.
01:09:20 Just get rid of this fucking channel.
01:09:22 We don't need,
01:09:23 we don't need to fucking see this bullshit.
01:09:26 Uh,
01:09:27 and that's what I did.
01:09:28 Uh,
01:09:29 the,
01:09:30 anyway.
01:09:31 We don't even need a bot.
01:09:33 We didn't even make videos anymore.
01:09:35 I actually,
01:09:36 Yeah.
01:09:37 I have a,
01:09:38 uh,
01:09:39 a couple of,
01:09:40 of gamers at Tavern exclusive Trixie stories.
01:09:44 Uh,
01:09:45 What?
01:09:46 Oh,
01:09:47 what?
01:09:48 What's this?
01:09:49 Like, um,
01:09:50 How,
01:09:51 how is this possible?
01:09:52 Uh,
01:09:53 last,
01:09:54 last year when,
01:09:55 uh,
01:09:56 I came on and,
01:09:57 uh,
01:09:58 it looked like at first,
01:09:59 uh,
01:10:00 it was just going to be me and you recording me and you, Ben.
01:10:02 And then,
01:10:03 uh,
01:10:04 we were having a conversation about something
01:10:06 while we were waiting for people.
01:10:09 And,
01:10:10 uh,
01:10:11 I think I mentioned something about,
01:10:12 uh,
01:10:13 you were having a bunch of guests on and I was,
01:10:15 uh,
01:10:16 I made the point that
01:10:17 it's going to be pretty difficult for you to keep that streak up that you had at the time.
01:10:20 You had a,
01:10:21 this streak of like,
01:10:22 bunch of guests.
01:10:23 Yeah.
01:10:24 Yeah.
01:10:25 Maybe that was around the time
01:10:27 that the Frog Fractions guy
01:10:30 that lady who was running for sheriff were on
01:10:33 or something like that.
01:10:34 Yeah, but anyways,
01:10:35 uh,
01:10:36 Trixie came in,
01:10:37 uh,
01:10:38 during that conversation.
01:10:39 She was on that episode,
01:10:40 uh,
01:10:41 that we did.
01:10:42 Uh,
01:10:43 and,
01:10:44 uh,
01:10:45 she said something kind of funny
01:10:46 that I just wanted to bring up,
01:10:48 uh,
01:10:49 because of new information that,
01:10:51 uh,
01:10:52 I have now.
01:10:53 She said,
01:10:54 um,
01:10:55 I was saying you can't just keep having new guests forever.
01:10:57 You're going to run out of guests eventually.
01:10:59 And she says,
01:11:00 well,
01:11:01 I know,
01:11:02 uh,
01:11:03 the guy who books guests for the dick show.
01:11:05 And,
01:11:06 uh,
01:11:07 so,
01:11:08 you know,
01:11:09 he's pretty good at booking guests.
01:11:10 We can,
01:11:11 we can,
01:11:12 that's a big money connection.
01:11:13 That's what we call a big money connection.
01:11:16 So,
01:11:17 at the time,
01:11:18 I didn't know who she was talking about.
01:11:20 Uh,
01:11:21 so I would just like,
01:11:22 I would just like,
01:11:23 okay,
01:11:24 I guess,
01:11:25 but,
01:11:26 you know,
01:11:27 thinking back on that now
01:11:28 with everything that I know now,
01:11:30 I'm pretty sure she,
01:11:31 she met Riley.
01:11:32 Yeah,
01:11:33 she,
01:11:34 that's,
01:11:35 that's pretty,
01:11:36 I think that's retroactively pretty funny now.
01:11:38 I think,
01:11:39 I think so.
01:11:40 Uh,
01:11:41 hmm,
01:11:42 uh,
01:11:43 uh,
01:11:44 I don't like her at all.
01:11:46 I think she's bad.
01:11:48 I think,
01:11:49 I think people should stop supporting her on Patreon.com.
01:11:53 Uh,
01:11:54 that's what my opinion.
01:11:55 Before,
01:11:56 uh,
01:11:57 it was actually before this episode that we recorded,
01:12:00 but I,
01:12:01 um,
01:12:02 this is kind of embarrassing,
01:12:03 I guess,
01:12:04 but I actually paid for a couple of Trixie Rants
01:12:06 and she never,
01:12:07 you know,
01:12:08 back when she was-
01:12:09 No!
01:12:10 Digi Bro,
01:12:11 she never did them.
01:12:12 You're kidding.
01:12:13 You paid for a couple?
01:12:15 Yeah,
01:12:16 I paid,
01:12:17 I think,
01:12:18 for two.
01:12:19 Neither of them happened.
01:12:20 No Rants.
01:12:21 That face went,
01:12:22 no Rants.
01:12:23 Brutal,
01:12:24 I thought at least for sure,
01:12:25 I just sat down and like,
01:12:26 cranked out all the rest of them at once or something,
01:12:29 but you know,
01:12:30 it is what it is.
01:12:31 I thought that happened as well.
01:12:32 I thought I remembered that happening,
01:12:33 yeah,
01:12:34 but,
01:12:35 hmm,
01:12:36 I heard,
01:12:37 I'll get it right after the,
01:12:39 the Brony lecture goes up,
01:12:40 don't worry.
01:12:41 Yeah, of course.
01:12:42 She's got to release that Brony lecture.
01:12:44 It's the way to kickstart the Branches of Yig Channel.
01:12:47 It's the only way.
01:12:48 She's getting double digit views.
01:12:50 She needs,
01:12:51 she needs a shot in the arm.
01:12:53 It needs,
01:12:54 wait,
01:12:55 I forgot,
01:12:56 she's an anti-vaxxer,
01:12:57 so that's a bad metaphor.
01:12:58 So,
01:12:59 I can't say that,
01:13:00 never mind,
01:13:01 never mind.
01:13:02 It's okay.
01:13:03 I have no hard feelings over it,
01:13:05 because I don't,
01:13:06 I honestly don't really care,
01:13:08 but I have the right to,
01:13:10 to be angry.
01:13:11 I'm just going,
01:13:12 choosing not to exercise that right.
01:13:14 Hmm.
01:13:15 That's
01:13:16 big of you.
01:13:17 Fringe.
01:13:18 Yeah.
01:13:19 You know,
01:13:20 you know me,
01:13:21 you know I would never
01:13:22 pass up an opportunity
01:13:23 to get mad about something
01:13:24 on Twitter.com.
01:13:25 I can't think of any
01:13:27 reason.
01:13:28 I mean,
01:13:29 getting mad,
01:13:30 that's content.
01:13:31 That's good content.
01:13:32 That's good content, baby.
01:13:33 That's a good point.
01:13:34 Now, that's what I call calm.
01:13:35 I'm feeling an emotion.
01:13:36 Turn on the camera.
01:13:37 Oh, my God,
01:13:38 I'm having a feeling.
01:13:39 It must record.
01:13:40 It must,
01:13:41 must monetize.
01:13:42 I made
01:13:43 a content
01:13:44 that's good content.
01:13:45 That's good content, baby.
01:13:46 That's a good point.
01:13:47 Now, that's what I call calm.
01:13:48 Oh, I'm feeling an emotion.
01:13:49 Turn on the camera.
01:13:50 Turn on the camera.
01:13:51 I made a comment.
01:13:52 I made a YouTube comment.
01:13:54 If you can believe it.
01:13:56 I made it.
01:13:57 I made a comment on.
01:13:59 This sounds bad already.
01:14:01 Yeah.
01:14:02 Well,
01:14:03 it's kind of funny.
01:14:04 I think,
01:14:05 I think this is W.
01:14:06 I think I'm going to call this W.
01:14:07 I made a comment on,
01:14:08 it's some other Chris Chan
01:14:10 YouTuber.
01:14:11 This guy's name is Dylan Thomas
01:14:13 and he's one of these weirdos who just
01:14:15 for years,
01:14:16 he just uploads like weekly, like
01:14:18 Chris Chan said something stupid
01:14:20 on Twitter.
01:14:21 Chris Chan thinks cartoons are real.
01:14:24 It's like this.
01:14:25 This is the level that he's at.
01:14:28 And he put out a video.
01:14:31 Like,
01:14:32 should we respect Chris's pronouns?
01:14:35 Short answer,
01:14:36 his answer is no.
01:14:38 And he gives all the usual,
01:14:39 like,
01:14:40 non-reasons that don't make any sense
01:14:42 for why he shouldn't.
01:14:44 So I just made one comment on the video.
01:14:46 That's like,
01:14:47 you know,
01:14:48 pretty pathetic.
01:14:49 You know,
01:14:50 not a lot of intellectual rigor on display.
01:14:52 Embarrassing.
01:14:53 You know,
01:14:54 you're irrational.
01:14:55 And I'm looking today and there's a whole,
01:14:56 like,
01:14:57 40 reply thread.
01:14:58 That's a win.
01:14:59 40 replies.
01:15:00 They're all like,
01:15:01 oh,
01:15:02 you're stupid.
01:15:03 You're thinking too hard about it.
01:15:05 You don't,
01:15:06 no,
01:15:07 you're stupid.
01:15:08 No,
01:15:09 you're a stupid one.
01:15:10 Seeing the amount of people to actually
01:15:11 unironically take that stance.
01:15:13 It's really fucking bizarre to me because
01:15:15 you can literally make the exact same argument.
01:15:17 Well,
01:15:18 you know,
01:15:19 I don't like using the n-word,
01:15:20 but I don't respect this black person.
01:15:21 Therefore,
01:15:22 I guess I should be allowed to use it, right?
01:15:24 I guess they should be racist.
01:15:25 Oh,
01:15:26 this imperative to be racist.
01:15:27 This black guy did a crime and you still,
01:15:30 you still don't think we should call him the n-word?
01:15:32 Not wanting to get called the n-word.
01:15:34 Like, bruh,
01:15:35 why are you defending his crime?
01:15:37 It is like the exact same,
01:15:39 like,
01:15:40 line of thought and there's no substantial difference
01:15:42 between the two in my opinion.
01:15:43 Like,
01:15:44 if you think one,
01:15:45 you necessarily should think the other.
01:15:46 You literally must think the other.
01:15:47 It's,
01:15:48 it's,
01:15:49 I mean,
01:15:50 it's embarrassing and this is,
01:15:51 this is a,
01:15:52 this is,
01:15:53 I mean,
01:15:54 this is the sad truth of,
01:15:55 like,
01:15:56 the,
01:15:57 the Chris,
01:15:58 the Chris-Chan community,
01:15:59 if you want to call it that,
01:16:00 like, the Chris-Chan fandom.
01:16:01 Like,
01:16:02 the devoted Chris-Chan fandom are all,
01:16:04 they're all idiots.
01:16:05 They're all Kiwi farmers.
01:16:06 They're all,
01:16:07 like,
01:16:08 weirdos
01:16:09 who are
01:16:10 embarrassing.
01:16:11 It's the,
01:16:12 the sad truth is that,
01:16:13 like, this is the audience that,
01:16:14 like,
01:16:15 I mean,
01:16:16 that's not the,
01:16:17 like,
01:16:18 the main audience that's like,
01:16:19 watch,
01:16:20 for instance,
01:16:21 my lecture.
01:16:22 Like,
01:16:23 I'm sure most people that watch the lecture are not,
01:16:24 like this,
01:16:25 but like,
01:16:26 some people were giving you the debt,
01:16:27 the debt,
01:16:28 releasing the lecture,
01:16:29 and they're like,
01:16:30 oh,
01:16:31 Ben was,
01:16:32 you know,
01:16:33 trying to capitalize on this.
01:16:34 But I mean,
01:16:35 I feel like there's a difference.
01:16:36 There's a big difference between releasing a lecture,
01:16:37 which was recorded
01:16:38 over a year prior,
01:16:39 versus making,
01:16:40 like,
01:16:41 daily.
01:16:42 I was going to say,
01:16:43 I was going to say weekly,
01:16:44 but literally,
01:16:46 lately,
01:16:47 they're exploding,
01:16:48 I see them all over the place,
01:16:49 but it's,
01:16:50 it's crazy to me that a few people,
01:16:51 like,
01:16:52 like,
01:16:53 G.B.
01:16:54 and Dylan Thomas,
01:16:55 and,
01:16:56 and,
01:16:57 like,
01:16:58 one or,
01:16:59 and a base shaman,
01:17:00 and like,
01:17:01 a few others,
01:17:02 their channels are just,
01:17:03 like,
01:17:04 like,
01:17:05 how much is there to even talk about?
01:17:06 Like,
01:17:07 like,
01:17:08 Chris says the same,
01:17:09 like,
01:17:10 insane fucking merge shit
01:17:11 on Twitter all the time.
01:17:12 How many times can you just like,
01:17:13 how wrong it is,
01:17:14 and how the,
01:17:15 there's no such thing as,
01:17:16 cartoons.
01:17:17 Guys,
01:17:18 you might have heard of this thing
01:17:19 called the Dimensional Merge.
01:17:21 Let me tell you why it's not real.
01:17:22 Let me break down
01:17:23 where the Dimensional Merge is not real,
01:17:24 with a 48 point list.
01:17:26 I can prove,
01:17:27 I can prove it,
01:17:28 actually,
01:17:29 and here's why.
01:17:30 Debunking the Dimensional Merge
01:17:31 with facts and logic.
01:17:32 It's like,
01:17:33 as I heard some shit
01:17:34 about the Dimensions Merging,
01:17:35 and I'm scared,
01:17:36 and I need someone to tell me,
01:17:37 it's all going to be okay.
01:17:39 Chris says that if I don't respect my OCs,
01:17:42 they're going to fucking kill me
01:17:43 when the merge happens.
01:17:44 There's a lot of content
01:17:45 that can be derived from Twitter feed.
01:17:47 Remember,
01:17:48 when Trump still had his Twitter,
01:17:50 and the mainstream media was just like
01:17:52 24-7 broadcasting all his tweets?
01:17:55 Yeah.
01:17:57 And there will always be like,
01:17:58 look how ridiculous this tweet is.
01:18:00 It's horrible.
01:18:01 Let's spend an entire segment
01:18:04 explaining why that is.
01:18:05 The amount of free advertising
01:18:07 that Trump got was unfathomable.
01:18:09 It's truly insane,
01:18:10 both before and after getting elected.
01:18:12 They were nonstop covering him.
01:18:14 It was honestly,
01:18:15 you have to appreciate that approach
01:18:17 to getting elected,
01:18:18 which is that have no qualifications.
01:18:20 Just get on the news
01:18:21 and have the news talk about you
01:18:22 all the time.
01:18:23 Yeah.
01:18:24 Yeah, it worked.
01:18:25 It worked.
01:18:26 What can you say about it?
01:18:27 It worked like a fucking dream, yeah.
01:18:29 Can't wait for the next time it works.
01:18:34 I'll never forget my favorite,
01:18:36 my favorite Trump tweet.
01:18:39 Coca-Cola company.
01:18:41 Not very happy with me.
01:18:42 That's okay.
01:18:43 I'll still drink that garbage.
01:18:45 Poetry.
01:18:46 Poetry.
01:18:47 And he made some of that.
01:18:48 Regardless of what you think about him.
01:18:49 Some funny tweets.
01:18:50 He was an eloquent Twitter user.
01:18:51 He was a powerful poster.
01:18:53 He made a lot of funny tweets.
01:18:54 He really did.
01:18:55 A lot of the things he would do
01:18:57 over and over again
01:18:58 are just like,
01:18:59 popular things people do now.
01:19:03 Like just saying an emotion
01:19:04 in capital letters at the end.
01:19:06 Sad.
01:19:07 Yeah.
01:19:08 Dude, his way of speaking straight up.
01:19:09 Well, first of all,
01:19:10 I guess like half the site,
01:19:11 all the conservatives like unironically
01:19:12 wanted to emulate it.
01:19:13 And then it's also funny as fuck.
01:19:15 So a lot of people just ironically
01:19:16 are doing shit like that.
01:19:17 And then he had to change the way
01:19:18 people spoke on Twitter.
01:19:19 It's very effective to just like,
01:19:21 just state very bluntly
01:19:23 what you're trying to say
01:19:25 and then say how you're supposed to
01:19:27 feel about it and then just repeat it.
01:19:29 Like that was a,
01:19:30 I watched a,
01:19:31 I think I watched a video
01:19:32 that was like about,
01:19:34 it was like a,
01:19:35 the channel was about like teaching
01:19:37 charisma or something.
01:19:38 It was about like teaching,
01:19:40 like how to be more persuasive
01:19:41 or charismatic person.
01:19:42 And they took like a video
01:19:44 about Trump and it's like,
01:19:45 how does Donald Trump speak
01:19:47 in a way that is so compelling to people?
01:19:49 And like one of his major tricks
01:19:50 is just that he repeats himself
01:19:52 over and over and over again.
01:19:53 And he'll just say the same thing twice in a row.
01:19:55 True.
01:19:56 So you don't forget it.
01:19:57 Yeah.
01:19:58 There's a funny scene in The Simpsons
01:19:59 where Marge is like,
01:20:00 this town is a part of us all,
01:20:01 a part of us all,
01:20:02 a part of us all.
01:20:03 Sorry to repeat myself,
01:20:04 I don't know if you remember.
01:20:05 Yeah.
01:20:06 And that actually works.
01:20:07 And Donald Trump literally got elected
01:20:09 on that advice.
01:20:10 So it works.
01:20:12 Donald Trump watched The Simpsons.
01:20:14 He got the idea of him running for president
01:20:16 from that Simpsons episode.
01:20:17 The Simpsons.
01:20:18 Yeah.
01:20:19 People always say The Simpsons predicted it.
01:20:20 Not enough people are giving Simpsons shit
01:20:22 for causing it.
01:20:23 They're the ones who cause all of this
01:20:24 in the first place.
01:20:25 Like he would,
01:20:26 he would make up little nicknames
01:20:27 for people like he would call Hillary.
01:20:28 He would call her,
01:20:29 like Lion Hillary, right?
01:20:30 I think that he called her like corrupt Hillary
01:20:32 or something.
01:20:33 Like crooked Hillary, wasn't she?
01:20:34 Crooked Hillary.
01:20:35 That was Lion Ted or some shit.
01:20:36 Right.
01:20:37 He gave everyone a little nickname
01:20:38 and that's funny because it's probably
01:20:39 the only reason he could keep track of them.
01:20:40 But it's like, you know,
01:20:41 that's people love that shit.
01:20:43 And it didn't even have to be like that.
01:20:45 Like crooked Hillary.
01:20:46 It didn't have to be clever or witty at all.
01:20:47 It's not exactly a joke,
01:20:48 but he just keeps saying it.
01:20:50 He just keeps saying,
01:20:51 yeah, crooked Hillary,
01:20:52 yeah, crooked,
01:20:53 and then he's thinking,
01:20:54 you're mine.
01:20:55 Oh yeah, crooked Hillary.
01:20:56 And then the media,
01:20:57 the news cry-ons are repeating that,
01:20:58 like crooked Hillary on CNN.
01:20:59 Yeah.
01:21:00 And quotation marks, you know what I mean?
01:21:01 Just say it enough.
01:21:03 Right.
01:21:04 That's why my next campaign
01:21:05 is just going to be walking around.
01:21:06 I'm just going to be walking around
01:21:07 and publicly saying,
01:21:08 I'm the president.
01:21:09 I am the president.
01:21:10 I'm the president.
01:21:11 I'm just going to start walking around
01:21:12 and telling people that.
01:21:13 And eventually, I will be the president.
01:21:14 And then literally,
01:21:15 and then whatever people talk about,
01:21:16 they'd be like,
01:21:17 Cybershell, like,
01:21:18 who's that?
01:21:19 Like, oh, you know,
01:21:20 that guy who always says he's the president.
01:21:21 I guess he's the president.
01:21:22 Oh yeah.
01:21:23 Oh yeah, the president.
01:21:24 He just seems so presidential.
01:21:25 And then everyone's like,
01:21:26 oh, you mean the president guy?
01:21:27 Sounds like something off of it.
01:21:33 Well, the real world is something awful.
01:21:36 It just works.
01:21:37 Psychology is so simple.
01:21:39 It's the easiest thing in the world.
01:21:43 Nothing to it.
01:21:44 Not much to it, yeah.
01:21:46 Yeah.
01:21:47 I guess Trump is going to go down
01:21:48 as the best, worst president in history.
01:21:52 He will always be missed.
01:21:54 Well, from this point on,
01:21:55 there will be two histories.
01:21:56 And one of them,
01:21:57 people are going to say he's great.
01:21:58 And the other one,
01:21:59 people are going to say he's bad.
01:22:01 And then luckily in the future,
01:22:02 it'll continue to fracture out.
01:22:03 We need to come together as a nation
01:22:05 and reach across the aisle
01:22:08 and agree that Trump was a legendary Twitter poster.
01:22:12 That's the only way.
01:22:13 That's true.
01:22:14 It's the one thing that binds us all together.
01:22:16 I honestly feel like he probably was more upset
01:22:18 about losing his Twitter account
01:22:20 than like almost anything else,
01:22:22 than maybe even losing the presidency.
01:22:23 I would assume that Twitter account
01:22:25 gave him more power than the office of the president.
01:22:28 I don't understand.
01:22:29 I don't understand why it was like only then
01:22:33 did they take his Twitter
01:22:34 only when he lost the election.
01:22:36 They were like, well, now we have to take it away.
01:22:37 It was hilarious, the timing.
01:22:38 Like he lost it.
01:22:39 And then it was, I guess it was,
01:22:40 it was right after the whole capital rate riot bullshit.
01:22:45 So it was like, oh, we have to take it away.
01:22:47 Was that why?
01:22:48 Was it like,
01:22:49 That was the reason I'm pretty sure they're like,
01:22:50 he was inciting it by posting that video
01:22:52 where he was like standby or whatever.
01:22:54 I don't know.
01:22:55 Yeah.
01:22:56 Yeah.
01:22:57 Yeah.
01:22:58 We love you.
01:22:59 You're very special.
01:23:00 He's talking to them like fucking Barney.
01:23:02 It's funny.
01:23:03 It's so funny.
01:23:06 A lot of the platforms like Twitter,
01:23:08 they ban people based on like PR stuff,
01:23:12 whatever makes them look best at that moment.
01:23:14 Right.
01:23:15 That was absolutely PR move on Twitter's part.
01:23:18 There was no like,
01:23:19 any like reasoning they could have had,
01:23:21 they could have done it way earlier,
01:23:22 but they would have gotten so much shit from people
01:23:24 when he was president.
01:23:25 I mean, I would kind of respect the ballziness
01:23:28 to just be like,
01:23:29 we're just going to ban the standing president
01:23:31 in the middle of his term,
01:23:34 just because we don't like his politics.
01:23:36 We just don't want him on our platform.
01:23:38 Twitter literally wanted him there objectively
01:23:41 because of the traffic he brought to the site.
01:23:43 Yeah.
01:23:44 I wonder if they didn't want to like be,
01:23:48 I don't know,
01:23:49 accused of like forcing,
01:23:53 like silencing him.
01:23:55 I know it's not actually censorship.
01:23:56 People are already going to take that stance of like,
01:23:58 oh, you ban all conservatives.
01:24:00 Like you're censoring him
01:24:01 and therefore people won't vote for him.
01:24:03 You're basically like rigging the election.
01:24:06 It could have backfired
01:24:07 if they banned them at a bad time.
01:24:09 Like you're right about that.
01:24:10 Like people would have gotten upset.
01:24:11 I mean, it did back.
01:24:12 That's exactly what people said.
01:24:13 I know.
01:24:14 So it's weird.
01:24:15 I just wonder why they didn't do anything
01:24:18 up until that point.
01:24:20 You're right, Ben.
01:24:21 They literally could have just banned them
01:24:22 at like in 2018.
01:24:23 They could have done it way ages ago,
01:24:25 but you know,
01:24:26 like I said, his posts were too fucking funny.
01:24:28 They really were like, you know,
01:24:29 the presidency ones in particular,
01:24:31 there's a lot of really funny ones.
01:24:33 If we've got these fucking billionaire technocrats
01:24:36 running these big tech conglomerations
01:24:38 that literally own us all
01:24:40 and manipulate our data
01:24:41 and have us all in their pocket,
01:24:43 I would at least like them.
01:24:45 I would at least like my corporate masters
01:24:47 to show a little bit of moral consistency,
01:24:49 a little bit of backbone.
01:24:50 Is it too much to ask?
01:24:51 That is way too much to ask.
01:24:52 Yes, it's far too much to ask.
01:24:53 No, no, I see.
01:24:54 Well, I apologize.
01:24:55 I don't know.
01:24:56 Not until we do it.
01:24:57 I was kind of bummed out when he got banned
01:24:59 because I really liked reading his tweets.
01:25:03 They were, you know,
01:25:05 I always like when you read someone's tweets
01:25:07 and you can easily like read it in their voice.
01:25:09 You know what I mean?
01:25:10 Like a tweet that sounds like
01:25:11 there's a specific person talking
01:25:13 and his tweets always like sounded like,
01:25:15 you can easily imagine him saying it.
01:25:17 Hmm.
01:25:18 He was a great comedy.
01:25:20 He didn't, he didn't say,
01:25:22 say what you say what you will about the man.
01:25:25 But he didn't post like a boomer.
01:25:27 He just posted on a very like straight forward,
01:25:30 like wet normal.
01:25:31 Well, honestly, he just said what he wanted to say.
01:25:33 The more I think about it, the more sad I am.
01:25:35 We never got to see the post presidency
01:25:37 Trump Twitter meltdown and just the subsequent
01:25:40 daily Biden is a piece of shit.
01:25:42 Yeah, that would have been great.
01:25:44 I agree.
01:25:45 I'm not sure banning him did any good
01:25:47 for anyone really.
01:25:49 I mean, I don't think.
01:25:51 Yeah, I don't think.
01:25:52 I don't think you can really say that it stopped much harm.
01:25:55 I mean, come on, anyone.
01:25:56 No, I don't think that is.
01:25:57 You could have made that choice.
01:25:58 They decided to do it ages ago,
01:26:00 but they basically waited until yeah,
01:26:01 like you said, like right at the very end.
01:26:03 You know what?
01:26:04 It's just robbing us of content.
01:26:05 It's just it's just wasted content.
01:26:07 That's the name of this episode is wasted content.
01:26:09 It's all about bemoaning all the things
01:26:11 we'll never get to consume in his private life
01:26:14 that were wasted content that we don't get to see.
01:26:17 They weren't monetized.
01:26:18 Wasted content and wasted comedy.
01:26:21 Exactly.
01:26:22 I think he is.
01:26:23 Money on the table.
01:26:24 Is he banned on YouTube?
01:26:25 Because when he got banned on Twitter,
01:26:26 it was like a big, it wasn't just Twitter.
01:26:27 He got banned off a shitload of social media apps.
01:26:29 I think everybody banned him.
01:26:30 Yeah.
01:26:31 I think everybody banned him.
01:26:32 Because I'm thinking that like he like.
01:26:33 That's a shame.
01:26:34 It really is a shame.
01:26:35 Like I would love to watch the Donald Trump YouTube show.
01:26:36 That would be fucking funny.
01:26:37 I want to see the Donald Trump like
01:26:39 Twitch stream fortnight.
01:26:41 Yeah.
01:26:42 I wanted to see Donald Trump let's play.
01:26:43 Many of politicians have Twitch streams now,
01:26:46 like for realsies.
01:26:47 So it's not even all the possibilities.
01:26:49 Didn't AOC play Among Us?
01:26:51 Among Us.
01:26:52 Yeah.
01:26:53 With Ilan Omar.
01:26:54 Yeah.
01:26:55 So funny.
01:26:56 Yeah.
01:26:57 It was pretty.
01:26:58 I guess maybe it never materialized,
01:27:00 but I was hearing when the election happened,
01:27:03 I was hearing people talking about Trump was going
01:27:05 to start like Trump TV and like start a whole
01:27:07 like independent like media outlet.
01:27:10 I thought, well, originally back in 2016,
01:27:12 I thought Trump TV was the game plan.
01:27:14 Like I didn't even think he really was trying to be president.
01:27:16 That hard.
01:27:17 I thought it was just get an absurd amount of press for free
01:27:20 and then, you know, pivot into being a TV star.
01:27:22 But this is what I read.
01:27:23 It was like it was the plan at first,
01:27:25 but then he became president.
01:27:27 He's like, I guess we'll just roll with this now.
01:27:28 I guess we'll just be president.
01:27:29 Like, okay.
01:27:30 Then I can get back to my real job of being a TV star.
01:27:32 Making Trump TV.
01:27:33 Yeah.
01:27:34 I guess we'll just be president of the United States.
01:27:37 I heard about Trump TV,
01:27:38 but I haven't heard anything about it since.
01:27:40 I first heard about it.
01:27:42 Yeah.
01:27:43 I feel like I haven't.
01:27:44 I'm surprised he's been.
01:27:45 I don't want to say he's been like quiet since leaving office,
01:27:48 but like there's been a few like press statements by him or whatever,
01:27:52 which are hilarious because they really like tweets.
01:27:54 Press statements.
01:27:55 And I keep seeing people say that someone basically just made
01:27:58 like a new Twitter,
01:27:59 like specifically just so that he could be on.
01:28:01 I don't know what that is.
01:28:02 I don't think it's Parler.
01:28:04 Doesn't he just have a website?
01:28:06 He just has a website where he like makes blog posts about how
01:28:10 he just makes what are essentially tweets.
01:28:12 I think he has like it's an email list,
01:28:14 which is like probably the same.
01:28:16 He's going to old school.
01:28:18 Right.
01:28:19 I think I think that's the current grift is just have an email list with
01:28:22 literally like 50 million emails on it and send out like weekly begging
01:28:25 for money.
01:28:26 Because that's nobody outside.
01:28:27 That really takes me back.
01:28:28 Your fucking circle is going to see it.
01:28:31 Those mailing lists take me back to like 2002 or 2003.
01:28:35 That was like the first way to keep in touch with people on the web
01:28:37 was like getting in that web ring or whatever.
01:28:39 That's still a very effective method of marketing.
01:28:41 Yeah.
01:28:42 People still value that.
01:28:43 You know what I mean?
01:28:44 Yeah.
01:28:45 Marketers are right.
01:28:46 I always get people on your email list.
01:28:47 Yeah.
01:28:48 I feel like it went out of fashion for a while,
01:28:49 but then like two years ago or so,
01:28:51 there was a kick of people being like,
01:28:53 you know what,
01:28:54 you know,
01:28:55 social media is bad and it's owned by big Corpo and like it's more,
01:28:59 it's kind of more effective.
01:29:02 Yeah.
01:29:03 Just an old school.
01:29:04 Join my mailing list.
01:29:05 Join my mailing list because my Twitter could get banned
01:29:07 for any reason at any time, right?
01:29:09 Well,
01:29:10 I love that part of being on the modern web is,
01:29:12 which is that, you know,
01:29:13 oh, I have a YouTube channel,
01:29:14 which is I make money.
01:29:15 I could just get banned at any time for any reason
01:29:17 that I would have no recourse.
01:29:19 It could just get hacked by some,
01:29:21 the only thing you can do,
01:29:22 for instance,
01:29:23 Brad Garley knows.
01:29:24 Imagine if that happened.
01:29:25 How embarrassed.
01:29:26 So that's why it's good to diversify,
01:29:28 have a Twitter,
01:29:29 have a Twitter,
01:29:30 even if you don't like Twitter,
01:29:31 it's not bad to have one just,
01:29:32 you know,
01:29:33 as like a backup type situation.
01:29:34 You got to diversify across different sites nowadays.
01:29:37 Yeah.
01:29:38 Just like investing in crypto or stocks,
01:29:40 diversify your portfolio.
01:29:42 Yeah.
01:29:43 If you're a coward,
01:29:44 you just put everything into one stock
01:29:46 and then wait for it to pump
01:29:47 and then take it off.
01:29:48 I have a shameful,
01:29:49 I have a shameful confession to make.
01:29:51 You being a crypto boy again.
01:29:52 I bought some,
01:29:53 I bought some Bitcoin.
01:29:54 Why would you buy it now?
01:29:56 It's going up.
01:29:58 It's going up.
01:29:59 It's going up.
01:30:00 I don't have anything bad.
01:30:02 It's going up.
01:30:03 It's going up.
01:30:04 We're never going to get
01:30:05 another cheap video card again.
01:30:06 It was going up.
01:30:07 That's like a thing of the past.
01:30:08 People in like 60 years
01:30:09 are going to be laughing like,
01:30:10 oh my, people used to be able
01:30:11 to buy video cards?
01:30:12 What?
01:30:13 You have not looked.
01:30:14 You have not looked.
01:30:15 No, it has,
01:30:16 it fell in a big way.
01:30:17 No, no, no.
01:30:18 It's been going up for like a month
01:30:19 or almost a month.
01:30:20 I've had like a bit of Ethereum
01:30:21 and a bit of Bitcoin for a while
01:30:22 and it was really low for a while.
01:30:24 And now it has been going up
01:30:26 but it's really slowed down.
01:30:27 I've just sold mine.
01:30:29 I feel like it's going to go back down again.
01:30:32 I mean, I don't know.
01:30:33 Maybe.
01:30:34 If you notice it's going up,
01:30:38 you've already missed the window.
01:30:40 That's not,
01:30:41 that's not true.
01:30:42 That's not true.
01:30:43 I mean,
01:30:44 maybe next week when Ben's
01:30:46 complaining about crypto prices
01:30:48 dropping and getting mad again,
01:30:49 maybe I'm just saying people
01:30:51 earlier in the year were predicting
01:30:53 like Bitcoin hitting 100K.
01:30:56 Everybody says that has a vested
01:30:58 interest in Bitcoin hitting.
01:31:00 And that's what I thought too.
01:31:01 But then I thought,
01:31:02 then I thought like it fell off a cliff
01:31:04 after the big pump.
01:31:05 And I was like,
01:31:06 okay, it's down.
01:31:07 But it's when you buy,
01:31:08 if you actually want to get back in on this.
01:31:10 But it started steadily.
01:31:12 It started steadily.
01:31:13 It's like almost halfway back up
01:31:14 to where it was.
01:31:15 And I'm like,
01:31:16 I feel like there's a real possibility
01:31:18 that it goes even higher
01:31:19 than it did the first time.
01:31:20 And I'm like, well,
01:31:21 if it does that,
01:31:22 it would be ashamed if I miss out.
01:31:24 So I fucking was like,
01:31:25 okay, fuck it.
01:31:26 I'll gamble it.
01:31:27 I'll just buy a little bit of Bitcoin.
01:31:28 Just in case.
01:31:29 I don't know.
01:31:30 I don't think it's that stupid.
01:31:31 I feel like I'm watching it every day.
01:31:33 If you buy when it's like 50%.
01:31:35 Cool.
01:31:36 It's going up.
01:31:37 But I want to not make the mistake
01:31:40 I made before
01:31:42 and not sell at the peak.
01:31:44 I've sold and I've made a profit.
01:31:47 And I'm hesitant to like jump back in
01:31:50 because it does look like
01:31:51 the curve upwards is like flattening out
01:31:55 right now.
01:31:56 Like it's slowing down a lot more
01:31:58 than it was.
01:31:59 But I don't know.
01:32:00 By the time you,
01:32:01 the viewer are listening to this,
01:32:02 it's definitely too late for you.
01:32:04 Don't even fucking think about buying anything.
01:32:06 Yeah, that's true.
01:32:07 Look at, no, no.
01:32:08 Look, I mean,
01:32:09 look how it's,
01:32:10 we got a fucking show.
01:32:11 Look at this curve.
01:32:12 Guys, if you want to get rich,
01:32:13 just buy some Ripple XRP.
01:32:15 That's my advice.
01:32:16 Let's just all invest in Ripple.
01:32:18 This curve,
01:32:19 this pattern looks to me
01:32:21 and obviously I don't know,
01:32:22 but it looks to me there
01:32:23 like it is like starting a bullish trend.
01:32:26 Right.
01:32:28 And that line is like a month long.
01:32:30 It's been,
01:32:31 it's been,
01:32:32 I don't know.
01:32:34 Well, how much Bitcoin do you have?
01:32:36 I have like,
01:32:38 it's not,
01:32:39 not as much as I had before.
01:32:40 I just,
01:32:41 I don't want to say,
01:32:42 I don't want to give numbers,
01:32:43 but I have,
01:32:44 I mean a fraction of a Bitcoin,
01:32:45 like a small fraction of a Bitcoin.
01:32:46 Cause like,
01:32:47 let's say it goes all the way back up
01:32:49 to like 56 or 47, right?
01:32:52 That's like a 20% increase.
01:32:54 If you bought like $500
01:32:56 in Bitcoin,
01:32:57 a 20% increase is only like a hundred more dollars.
01:33:00 It's not going to be significant.
01:33:01 So I'll make a hundred dollars.
01:33:03 Yeah.
01:33:04 That's what I'm hoping to make a hundred dollars.
01:33:07 I guess.
01:33:09 What are you saying?
01:33:10 You're,
01:33:11 I don't understand.
01:33:12 You're like,
01:33:13 but Ben,
01:33:14 sure if it goes up,
01:33:15 you'll make money.
01:33:16 But if it goes down,
01:33:17 you'll lose money.
01:33:18 I know.
01:33:19 I'm saying the time to buy
01:33:20 was when it was like
01:33:21 way lower.
01:33:22 So you could have bought
01:33:23 $500 then.
01:33:24 This is so foolish.
01:33:25 You could have already opened up
01:33:26 so much more money.
01:33:27 We will see.
01:33:28 Yes.
01:33:29 Obviously.
01:33:30 Ben has bought his.
01:33:31 So we'll see what he wins.
01:33:32 Obviously it would have been better.
01:33:33 Obviously it would have been better to buy
01:33:35 when it was even lower.
01:33:36 But if it goes up from here,
01:33:38 it's still good to buy now.
01:33:40 Sure.
01:33:41 My bigger complaint
01:33:42 is that we've been down this road
01:33:43 like four times
01:33:44 and explained this to you four times
01:33:45 and you keep buying at the same time
01:33:47 instead of revising your strategy.
01:33:50 I don't think that's true.
01:33:53 I don't really feel like that's true,
01:33:56 actually.
01:33:57 I do promise that I won't make it
01:34:00 a big fucking thing.
01:34:01 This won't be the crypto cast again.
01:34:04 I can't believe that.
01:34:07 Okay.
01:34:08 Well.
01:34:09 I'm afraid we can't trust your assurances,
01:34:11 Ben.
01:34:12 Here's the thing.
01:34:13 If Ben loses money,
01:34:14 if Ben loses money,
01:34:15 it'll be like half a crypto cast.
01:34:17 If Ben gains a lot of money,
01:34:19 we're not going to hear the end of it.
01:34:21 He's going to rub it in my face.
01:34:22 He's going to rub it in our faces.
01:34:23 Everyone in chat.
01:34:24 No, that's a good point.
01:34:25 YouTube comments.
01:34:26 Be praying and emojis
01:34:27 for Ben to be losing money.
01:34:29 I think if I make a huge profits on crypto,
01:34:33 I think I'll be embarrassed
01:34:34 and I won't want to talk about it.
01:34:36 Oh, well, if it isn't the capitalist Ben St,
01:34:38 who loves cryptocurrency
01:34:40 and all sorts of other currencies.
01:34:42 See, this is why.
01:34:43 I'm feeling the shame.
01:34:45 I'm going to use all those profits
01:34:46 to buy carbon credits
01:34:47 to offset all the damage
01:34:48 you're doing to the environment.
01:34:50 Ben St.
01:34:51 Oh, fuck.
01:34:52 Yeah, for our socialists,
01:34:53 you should enjoy capital.
01:34:55 You sure do enjoy having money, you hypocrite.
01:34:59 Yet you choose to participate
01:35:01 in this society of ours.
01:35:03 Why aren't you living in a commune
01:35:04 waiting for the second coming of Christ?
01:35:06 Like a good fucking commie.
01:35:08 God, I wish.
01:35:09 God, I wish.
01:35:13 Jesus, love him.
01:35:16 Now, there was some...
01:35:17 the crucifixion of Christ?
01:35:18 Now, there was some fucking content.
01:35:20 They really milked the shit out of that one.
01:35:22 They're still talking about it.
01:35:24 That was...
01:35:25 I mean, that was not wasted content.
01:35:27 That one was...
01:35:28 Yeah, that one was milked.
01:35:29 That one was heavily monetized.
01:35:32 They started a Twitch stream
01:35:34 that you might have heard of.
01:35:35 It's called the Roman Catholic Church.
01:35:37 It's still good.
01:35:38 They have so many subs.
01:35:40 They get doughnose every fucking Sunday.
01:35:42 I would love to see a video that says...
01:35:44 They only stream once a week
01:35:45 and somehow they still make a fuck ton of money.
01:35:48 It's great.
01:35:51 I would love to see an apology video
01:35:53 from Judas Iscariot.
01:35:54 He's just sitting there like,
01:35:55 guys, I feel so shitty
01:35:57 about what I did to Jesus.
01:36:01 My apology.
01:36:02 Judas Iscariot makes an apology video.
01:36:05 It's like, I'm sorry.
01:36:06 I'm sorry I gave Jesus to the Romans.
01:36:08 It's like, oh, he monetized the video.
01:36:10 He left ads on the video.
01:36:12 Judas Iscariot.
01:36:14 Ratted him out
01:36:15 to fucking Twitch staff
01:36:17 and then he got fucking banned for three days.
01:36:19 But then he came back
01:36:20 and was even bigger than before.
01:36:23 He made partner.
01:36:24 He made partner as a result.
01:36:27 You know, I know it was a joke,
01:36:29 but actual churches do have Twitch channels
01:36:32 and they do stream their services.
01:36:34 I've seen it before.
01:36:36 Yeah, I've seen that.
01:36:37 Do they get doughnose from Twitch chat?
01:36:39 I think they do.
01:36:40 They don't know as the substitute
01:36:42 for the passing the thing around.
01:36:44 How fucking great would it be
01:36:46 if the priest did get up
01:36:47 on the pulpit or whatever
01:36:48 and just be like,
01:36:49 all right, I've got to read up my doughnose
01:36:50 for the stream before we move on
01:36:51 with the actual mask.
01:36:53 He gives live shout-outs.
01:36:56 Interrupting the server
01:36:58 and just go, oh, Pog.
01:36:59 Omega Pog.
01:37:00 Check out that doughnose.
01:37:03 That's basically the reality we live in right now.
01:37:05 Subscribe at tier three.
01:37:06 You get an annulment.
01:37:07 It's like when you put a 20
01:37:11 into the collection plate,
01:37:13 it's like a soundboard
01:37:15 starts like air horn,
01:37:16 like...
01:37:18 lights light up behind him
01:37:20 on the pulpit or whatever.
01:37:21 Confetti is released.
01:37:24 Like the same confetti for weddings.
01:37:26 Church needs to start a vtuber of Jesus.
01:37:29 They've got to get their new image up there.
01:37:31 Dude, I would love to see a hot tub stream,
01:37:34 but it's all holy water
01:37:35 and they're just like,
01:37:36 you pay money to get your name written
01:37:38 on one of those little crackers.
01:37:39 A hot tub stream,
01:37:40 but it's like baptisms.
01:37:42 Yeah, baptizing people and shit.
01:37:44 There was a church near my house
01:37:47 where they had a big tank.
01:37:52 They had a big water tank,
01:37:53 and I guess the priest would bless the tank.
01:37:55 And they had a dispenser.
01:37:56 You could go up
01:37:57 and you could rinse your hands
01:37:59 on this little spout
01:38:01 out of this little plastic tank.
01:38:02 You could just dispense some holy water
01:38:04 into your hands, I guess,
01:38:06 if you wanted some.
01:38:08 The tank was there.
01:38:09 People have containers of holy water
01:38:11 they use for stuff around their house.
01:38:13 That was like a refill.
01:38:16 Yeah, I had...
01:38:18 What do you do with it?
01:38:20 I'm not sure.
01:38:21 What does he do to it
01:38:22 to make it holy water?
01:38:23 That's what I don't know.
01:38:25 Does he piss in it?
01:38:27 Do you spit in it?
01:38:29 I thought it was so cool.
01:38:30 I had a fancy,
01:38:31 like an old glass perfume bottle,
01:38:34 and I went and I filled it up with it.
01:38:36 I was like, oh my God,
01:38:37 I have this fancy red,
01:38:40 this like red stained glass bottle.
01:38:42 It's full of sacred water.
01:38:44 It's so fucking holy.
01:38:46 It's so ready to fight a vampire.
01:38:48 Exactly.
01:38:49 Yeah, exactly.
01:38:50 You use it on vampires and zombies.
01:38:52 That's what Castlevania taught me.
01:38:54 That's why they put it out.
01:38:56 It's like for a home,
01:38:58 it's for a defense.
01:39:00 It's important to have a lot of compartments in your house
01:39:02 with holy water and whips and crosses.
01:39:04 When the kids come around for trick or treat,
01:39:06 you just splash it in their faces,
01:39:08 and they throw it on demons.
01:39:10 The best way is to throw it like a grenade,
01:39:12 and then when it lands,
01:39:14 it explodes with a little fire effect.
01:39:16 Yep.
01:39:18 I just throw the bottle,
01:39:20 and it just clunks someone in the head
01:39:22 and gives them a concussion.
01:39:24 It strangely goes at a 45-degree angle,
01:39:26 no matter how you throw it.
01:39:28 It needs to shatter.
01:39:30 Yeah.
01:39:34 Now I'm second guessing
01:39:36 the sale of Bitcoin.
01:39:40 You can go all in,
01:39:42 and if you lose money,
01:39:44 I did make a profit.
01:39:46 Think of it this way.
01:39:48 If you don't own Bitcoin,
01:39:50 and then it goes up, you lose.
01:39:52 No, you don't.
01:39:54 Yes, you do.
01:39:56 I don't know.
01:39:58 Ben is right. Every single day of your life,
01:40:00 you are losing at casinos
01:40:02 and all sorts of games that you're choosing
01:40:04 not to take in.
01:40:06 Think of how much money you're losing
01:40:08 by not going to Vegas right now
01:40:10 and betting on your money.
01:40:12 Think of all the free V-Bucks I'm losing
01:40:14 by not buying and getting my bonus
01:40:16 on my purchases.
01:40:18 You're actively losing money every second.
01:40:20 That's how corporations
01:40:22 plan their profit margins.
01:40:24 Exactly.
01:40:26 Whenever it goes down,
01:40:28 that's not money they're losing.
01:40:30 That's money that they're not making.
01:40:32 If they're still making money,
01:40:34 but not...
01:40:36 Even if they're still making the same amount
01:40:38 of money as before,
01:40:40 that's terrible.
01:40:42 We should have been making even more than we used to make.
01:40:44 There's nothing wrong with
01:40:46 expanding exponential growth forever.
01:40:48 No, of course not.
01:40:50 Man, it would be really unfortunate
01:40:52 if the dominant business model
01:40:54 of the entire planet was growth
01:40:56 on a finite system like the planet Earth.
01:40:58 Man, that'd be pretty fucking shitty, guys.
01:41:00 I don't understand.
01:41:02 I think it'll all be worth it
01:41:04 as long as some specific shareholders
01:41:06 make a lot of profit.
01:41:08 We can always get another Earth.
01:41:10 Those guys can just go to Mars.
01:41:12 Right.
01:41:14 So what's the big deal?
01:41:16 There isn't a single motion right now
01:41:18 who owns an Amazon Prime subscription.
01:41:20 It's a completely untapped market.
01:41:22 You just have to become one of those guys.
01:41:24 If the existential Earth might fail on Earth,
01:41:26 but on Mars, it's going to be different.
01:41:28 Mars is half the size,
01:41:30 so the growth will be twice as fast.
01:41:32 A civilization of people who all watch
01:41:34 Rick and Morty. It would be so advanced.
01:41:36 There'd be no stopping them.
01:41:38 Yeah, that's true.
01:41:40 Is that what Mars is?
01:41:42 Yes, it's just going to be Elon Musk
01:41:44 and the rest of his Rick and Morty pals.
01:41:46 Did you see Elon Musk
01:41:48 and Grimes on Twitter?
01:41:50 These fucking freaks.
01:41:52 They're being all like,
01:41:54 Elon,
01:41:56 make me a cyborg body, please.
01:41:58 Yeah, they're cringe on Twitter,
01:42:00 which is truly the highest crime possible.
01:42:02 Why on Earth
01:42:04 are you paying attention?
01:42:06 Yeah, that was my question.
01:42:08 I saw someone else retweet a screenshot of it,
01:42:10 so I'm not following them,
01:42:12 but I saw it rebask.
01:42:14 Oh man, it just reminds me
01:42:16 of dislike these people a lot.
01:42:18 I so much hate things of many people.
01:42:20 I hate them. I so much hate them.
01:42:22 That's what I do.
01:42:24 I wake up and I look at a list of every
01:42:26 single famous person.
01:42:28 I hate that person.
01:42:30 That's how you wake up in the morning.
01:42:32 That guy's just a problem.
01:42:34 Ben, you should wake up in the morning
01:42:36 and think of all the things you love.
01:42:40 Done.
01:42:42 Now you've got to think of more.
01:42:44 You've got to start loving more things
01:42:46 than zero things.
01:42:48 Just think about how much money
01:42:50 you're going to make off of Bitcoin
01:42:52 and it's definitely not going to bite you in the ass
01:42:54 because it can only go up.
01:42:56 It will only eventually go up as long as you don't sell.
01:42:58 It literally can only go up.
01:43:00 You don't lose money until you've
01:43:02 sold it at a loss.
01:43:04 So if you never sell.
01:43:06 That was that thing we came up with.
01:43:08 If we do
01:43:10 the opposite,
01:43:12 then at least one of us will make money.
01:43:14 Ben keeps his Bitcoin
01:43:16 and I wait for it to crash before I put back in
01:43:18 if at all.
01:43:20 Then at least one of us
01:43:22 will be with the winner.
01:43:24 This is not a financial advice podcast,
01:43:26 but if you follow one of them,
01:43:28 you're guaranteed to make money
01:43:30 because we're covering possible outcomes.
01:43:32 Not having Bitcoin and having it.
01:43:34 If it bit you in the ass,
01:43:36 then it would be Bitcoin.
01:43:38 The name would be apps.
01:43:40 Aren't those the two genders?
01:43:42 Not having Bitcoin and having Bitcoin?
01:43:44 Sounds about right.
01:43:46 I think so. I've read that somewhere.
01:43:48 I still have Dogecoin though.
01:43:50 If everything goes way up,
01:43:52 I'll still have that Dogecoin.
01:43:54 Literally, way before I knew this Doge should happen,
01:43:56 like a year and a half or maybe two years ago,
01:43:58 I didn't do it. I fucking hate myself so much.
01:44:00 I almost bought a shitload of Dogecoin
01:44:02 just because I was like, that dog
01:44:04 is going to die pretty soon
01:44:06 and it's probably going to spike in value.
01:44:08 So I was just being very opportunistic about it.
01:44:10 Dogecoin is
01:44:12 well, it's almost back up to
01:44:14 30 cents.
01:44:16 It's doubled in the last...
01:44:18 It's interesting. You watch Ethereum,
01:44:20 Dogecoin and Bitcoin and their graphs
01:44:22 are almost all the way back then.
01:44:24 It's just people's faith.
01:44:26 It's not that it's not the specific ones,
01:44:28 but it's also...
01:44:30 It's almost like these coins are just
01:44:32 fucking investments and have no value
01:44:34 outside of people hyping them up.
01:44:36 I don't think I can agree with that.
01:44:38 Are you seriously discounting
01:44:40 the myriad of uses that you can have
01:44:42 for Bitcoins like buying drugs
01:44:44 online, buying
01:44:46 pornography online.
01:44:48 Those are the only two, but
01:44:50 those exist.
01:44:52 You're right.
01:44:54 AMC is going to start accepting Bitcoin
01:44:56 because they're a meme stock and they're leaning into it.
01:44:58 Unironic, that is true.
01:45:00 What could go wrong with a currency that can
01:45:02 rapidly devalue itself to half
01:45:04 in one day? There's no possible
01:45:06 way that could bite them in the ass.
01:45:08 What if you could leave your car idling
01:45:10 and it would generate
01:45:12 arcade tokens that you could
01:45:14 trade for heroin and that's what Bitcoin is?
01:45:16 It already does.
01:45:18 You can just hook up like a bag
01:45:20 to your car exhaust and then huff the fumes
01:45:22 and then get high off that and you can trade that for drugs.
01:45:24 Just put your mouth over
01:45:26 the environment.
01:45:28 Just deep-throat that...
01:45:30 That's a solution.
01:45:32 Just an illusion, yeah.
01:45:34 That's a solution to climate change.
01:45:36 Just put bags over your car exhaust
01:45:38 so it doesn't go into the atmosphere and sell it for drugs.
01:45:40 Just put a big garbage bag over the back
01:45:42 of your car and then when you're done
01:45:44 just bury the bag in your backyard
01:45:46 and then there's no problem.
01:45:48 Just put the carbon back in the ground
01:45:50 where we got it from.
01:45:52 Right, just burying it, grow a carbon tree.
01:45:54 A lot of good ideas
01:45:56 in this episode.
01:45:58 Dude, we're like solving all the world's problems.
01:46:00 Million-dollar ideas here.
01:46:02 They're all patented by the way.
01:46:04 We will sue the fuck out of you if anyone's
01:46:06 asking for any of these things.
01:46:08 Exactly.
01:46:10 If you could hook up a car engine...
01:46:12 You only pay me a bitcoin, by the way.
01:46:14 You know how
01:46:16 bitcoins always like, oh, we gotta get computers
01:46:18 or whatever to do it.
01:46:20 What if you could hook up mining bitcoin
01:46:22 to a car exhaust and then people
01:46:24 would drive to make bitcoin
01:46:26 and then that would be like so much bitcoin.
01:46:28 Sheet.
01:46:30 Infinite funds.
01:46:32 Never mind the greenhouse gases accelerating.
01:46:34 Someone gets a toshi on the line.
01:46:36 We gotta fucking figure this out.
01:46:38 A boat.
01:46:40 What if you build a sailboat and you just
01:46:42 attached a big fan to it
01:46:44 that would blow air into the sail
01:46:46 and then you would just push the boat
01:46:48 in a perpetual
01:46:50 motion machine?
01:46:52 What if you covered yourself in oil
01:46:54 and then you went out when it was raining
01:46:56 and then you started flying because oil is lighter than water?
01:47:02 I'm not sure if that would work.
01:47:04 You should live stream that.
01:47:06 You should live stream it.
01:47:08 Live stream perpetual motion machine
01:47:10 test number one.
01:47:16 Yes, please.
01:47:22 Do we think it's time to start listening
01:47:24 to voicemails?
01:47:26 An hour and a half, give or take.
01:47:28 Well, I've got one thing to talk about.
01:47:30 We haven't even talked about
01:47:32 anything.
01:47:34 Zero topics of discussion.
01:47:36 We've literally just been like, um,
01:47:38 for like an hour and a half.
01:47:40 Usually, by this point, I would have been like,
01:47:42 I would have been like, yeah.
01:47:44 Let's start the fucking show, guys.
01:47:46 Let's get down to business.
01:47:48 At least I even cut out everything that happened
01:47:50 before this point.
01:47:52 Let's cut the crap and get down to brass tax.
01:47:54 We've got business to attend to.
01:47:56 There was one thing I wanted to get on record.
01:47:58 Uh,
01:48:00 because I don't think people are aware of this,
01:48:02 but, uh,
01:48:04 I've been a fan of Cyber Shell
01:48:06 since around 2008 or so,
01:48:08 I think.
01:48:10 Wait, what? Before the PCP was even a
01:48:12 twinkle in anybody's eye.
01:48:14 Yeah, me and gamers have been
01:48:16 our old school LP heads
01:48:18 from when that was a brand new
01:48:20 and creative art form
01:48:22 just bursting onto the scene
01:48:24 and everybody was so excited about it
01:48:26 that they could have predicted how horrible it would become
01:48:28 and how awful modern twitch culture
01:48:30 will be. And it's definitely not my fault.
01:48:32 I didn't need to contribute to this at all.
01:48:34 Yeah, don't try and play me.
01:48:36 That's definitely true.
01:48:38 Uh, but I never,
01:48:40 I never thought I'd eventually
01:48:42 be talking to the great Sonic lore master himself.
01:48:44 This kind of just
01:48:46 happened, uh,
01:48:48 by mere happenstance
01:48:50 because I wasn't, uh, I didn't even know
01:48:52 what the PCP was until 2018
01:48:54 when I was, uh,
01:48:56 invited on by, uh,
01:48:58 I specifically remember that
01:49:00 because, you know, the PCP
01:49:02 used to be a very non-guest
01:49:04 type podcast, you know what I mean?
01:49:06 I was very surprised when I got asked to be on
01:49:08 because it was like, I was not the first guest ever
01:49:10 obviously, but like, I was like the first
01:49:12 guest in a long, like there was a,
01:49:14 it became guest time for quite a while after that
01:49:16 so I was like, what the fuck?
01:49:18 I had, I had literally never,
01:49:20 I had literally never even heard of
01:49:22 Cybershell. How dare you.
01:49:24 Not be a Sonic fan. Until someone
01:49:26 said, Ben,
01:49:28 Cybershell, reference your, your lecture
01:49:30 in a video and I looked
01:49:32 at my, my ad sense and like
01:49:34 I had made like more ad revenue
01:49:36 than usual in the last couple days.
01:49:38 You could actually see the runoff effect
01:49:40 of people going to that video from
01:49:42 my tale to get strolled video. Yeah.
01:49:44 Yeah. Yeah. That was, uh, really
01:49:46 surprising to me when I saw, uh,
01:49:48 that, uh, you were on
01:49:50 a PCP Cybershell and I heard somebody
01:49:52 mentioned that you, you were, uh,
01:49:54 a PCP fan.
01:49:56 So that, uh, surprised me even more.
01:49:58 I was like, whoa. I was, I didn't
01:50:00 believe, I still don't believe it.
01:50:02 I mean, I remember seeing, I remember
01:50:04 seeing Cybershell's like name
01:50:06 and, and, uh, avatar
01:50:08 like in comments of early PCP
01:50:10 or at least some, like
01:50:12 some amount of PCP episodes.
01:50:14 You can go back and find out. I had no idea you were a big
01:50:16 YouTuber. Well, I wasn't a big YouTuber
01:50:18 at the time, especially back then. It's like, if you
01:50:20 find my like 2016 comments, I was like,
01:50:22 um, well, I had my one
01:50:24 little let's play I did for something
01:50:26 awful back in the day and I had like, I don't know,
01:50:28 under 10K subs. I can't
01:50:30 remember the exact amount, but it was like some amount
01:50:32 of subs. And then it was just like
01:50:34 in 2017, all these people
01:50:36 were making videos and I was like, I guess I can
01:50:38 make a video. Making a video doesn't seem like it'd be that hard
01:50:40 to do, right? Because, um,
01:50:42 I just had this weird thing where I promised
01:50:44 I was going to do a Sonic 2 bonus video
01:50:46 back in 2008 and then I never did it.
01:50:48 So I had eight years worth
01:50:50 of just cheeky comments of people going, oh,
01:50:52 when's the Sonic 2 bonus video? So I
01:50:54 took all of those comments. I made a little
01:50:56 montage and I was like, fine, I'll make
01:50:58 the little video you guys wanted. Are you happy now?
01:51:00 And then I just made a couple more videos
01:51:02 and I don't know, you know, we make a couple videos
01:51:04 they do well. So you want to keep making
01:51:06 more ones, I guess. I don't know.
01:51:08 Yeah, I remember that. You do a little content.
01:51:10 You do a little content.
01:51:12 Yeah. Cyber show at one point
01:51:14 and maybe hard to believe this now was
01:51:16 an underdog
01:51:18 video maker on YouTube.
01:51:20 And I was following him since back
01:51:22 in those days.
01:51:24 But it's, um, it's just weird
01:51:26 how I never knew about
01:51:28 the PCP and now I'm,
01:51:30 you know, I'm on it and I'm a fan of it
01:51:32 and it just so happens that Cyber show
01:51:34 we both ended up on
01:51:36 the same episode because I had the same thing where I recognize
01:51:38 gamers taverns avatar
01:51:40 from like comments from like ages
01:51:42 and ages and ages ago. So I just, I don't know.
01:51:44 You just see people in the comments enough, you sort of like
01:51:46 start to just, you know, remember them or whatever.
01:51:48 I always just, for some reason
01:51:50 is his avatar of just gamers tavern
01:51:52 where it's like a shade of brown and then like
01:51:54 like a slightly different shade of brown
01:51:56 for some reason that always just stuck in my mind.
01:51:58 But that means I did
01:52:00 a pretty good job designing that logo
01:52:02 for not being an artist. It's minimalistic
01:52:04 but it works. It's
01:52:06 enough.
01:52:08 It's enough. At least it's not a fucking
01:52:10 anime avatar. Yeah.
01:52:12 Am I right? Not one of these sick
01:52:14 fucks. Anime people.
01:52:16 Those are pretty
01:52:18 terrible. Something else
01:52:20 that surprised me is to find out that
01:52:22 Shuga Conroy
01:52:24 is a big fan of yours
01:52:26 Cyber show.
01:52:28 Yeah. There are a few
01:52:30 like, you know,
01:52:32 bigger people who are like still doing
01:52:34 Let's Plays or whatever, you know, like Shuga Conroy
01:52:36 which is crazy to me that there are still
01:52:38 people out there making money and like continuing
01:52:40 to keep the Let's Play tradition alive.
01:52:42 And I mean, most of Let's Plays tradition
01:52:44 sort of exists now on like Twitch, you know what I mean?
01:52:46 And like live streaming which is fine
01:52:48 and is like good but it's sort of a separate thing,
01:52:50 you know, from like the
01:52:52 pre-recorded Let's Play days of old
01:52:54 Yeah, Shuga Conroy
01:52:56 was one of the original YouTube Let's
01:52:58 Players I think back from
01:53:00 2006 or something and I
01:53:02 started watching him on and off since around
01:53:04 that time. And
01:53:06 he's one of the pre-game grumps
01:53:08 appears and
01:53:10 it's pretty surprised that he knew
01:53:12 of you and is a fan of yours.
01:53:14 That's pretty cool.
01:53:16 Yeah, I actually never
01:53:18 like talked to him that much back in the day.
01:53:20 I actually knew, he's part of a group called
01:53:22 The Runaway Guys with a guy called Proton
01:53:24 John and I knew Proton John from something
01:53:26 awful because, you know,
01:53:28 that's where all the cool kids were hanging out
01:53:30 back in 2007-2008, you know,
01:53:32 the hub of all cool
01:53:34 internet activity that sort of became a nasty
01:53:36 little seed which blossomed
01:53:38 into a million other parts of
01:53:40 modern internet culture of something awful,
01:53:42 you know what I mean?
01:53:44 Well, I figure since
01:53:46 Shuga Conroy is a fan of yours, maybe you should
01:53:48 you could pitch him my
01:53:50 LPs one day.
01:53:52 Oh yeah, I'll definitely
01:53:54 Yeah, you, you, you're also
01:53:56 making good Let's Plays, a very
01:53:58 I really like, I really like the
01:54:00 Gamer's Tavern, the Gamer's Tavern
01:54:02 collection of Let's Plays.
01:54:04 Nobody, nobody tries to be funny in their Let's Plays
01:54:06 everybody just thinks their stupid natural
01:54:08 personality was going to be enough
01:54:10 to cut like, you know, carry the
01:54:12 I just thought, I thought maybe he'd like
01:54:14 them because he's a, from what I hear
01:54:16 he's a big pun guy and
01:54:18 that's kind of my specialty.
01:54:20 I feel like he absolutely would like your videos, definitely
01:54:22 he's got that kind of very
01:54:24 you know, you know, humorous
01:54:26 sensibility, you know what I mean? Where it's just like
01:54:28 a lot of unrelenting punchlines after another
01:54:30 which is great. Nobody, nobody writes
01:54:32 material for their Let's Plays
01:54:34 It's a loss, a lost art.
01:54:36 It's ironic to like complain about that
01:54:38 Part of me does miss that, you know what I mean?
01:54:42 That's exactly why I chose to do it because
01:54:44 I figured nobody in their right mind
01:54:46 would do this.
01:54:48 That's how you know you have a good video
01:54:50 That's reason enough.
01:54:52 I agree.
01:54:54 It's funny because back in the day
01:54:56 people used to accuse Let's
01:54:58 players of scripting their videos
01:55:00 but actually
01:55:02 nobody ever did that because that would require
01:55:04 you know, effort.
01:55:06 To fully script out a video
01:55:08 yeah, that would be like a lot of work.
01:55:10 Usually I would just have like, you know
01:55:12 things I want to talk about that I try to
01:55:14 make sound natural.
01:55:16 If you thought that
01:55:18 the banter in a Let's Play
01:55:20 was so sharp that you were like
01:55:22 this can't be off the cuff
01:55:24 this has to have been like prescripted
01:55:26 and like written and produced
01:55:28 I was just like, wow
01:55:30 The news comes out, Aaron Hansen
01:55:32 has never played a video game.
01:55:34 It's all been scripted.
01:55:36 It really tells you a little bit about
01:55:38 the person that they can't imagine
01:55:40 having a funny conversation like that.
01:55:44 Some people are natural entertainers
01:55:46 it's kind of weird. Some people like Jerma
01:55:48 they can just flip a switch
01:55:50 and they're just like on, you know what I mean?
01:55:52 They can just be funny for like extended periods of time.
01:55:54 Yeah, that's definitely true
01:55:56 and I'm not one of those people
01:55:58 that's why I need a script.
01:56:00 Hey, there's nothing wrong with that
01:56:02 nothing wrong with a nice bit of scripted content.
01:56:04 Not everyone has to be a
01:56:06 Twitch streamer in my book
01:56:10 You're missing out on content though
01:56:12 as you've been saying.
01:56:14 Every second in your life is content
01:56:16 You should live stream
01:56:18 your script writing
01:56:20 We should live stream us
01:56:22 recording the episode
01:56:24 before we release the episode
01:56:26 You live stream the recording of the episode
01:56:28 then you have the episode premiere
01:56:30 and then you can have the post premiere
01:56:32 look back at the episode
01:56:34 the walking dead and the talking dead
01:56:36 look back at the episode
01:56:38 look back at the PCP we just were on
01:56:40 Which then we live stream our
01:56:42 after like how do we feel about the reception
01:56:44 of this episode
01:56:46 That was a few bonus episodes where we just talk it over
01:56:48 a PCP
01:56:50 as if it was a mystery science
01:56:52 theatre in your old episodes
01:56:54 I think we haven't done another one in a while
01:56:58 Yeah, you were on the one
01:57:00 because we did your old episode
01:57:02 the first episode you were on
01:57:04 we did the re...
01:57:06 the PCP will never die
01:57:08 it'll be like a loop
01:57:10 it starts back at the beginning
01:57:12 now we're going to be commenting on the first episode again
01:57:14 We should just not even have those as bonus episodes
01:57:16 that should be the next
01:57:18 That's the next phase of the PCP
01:57:20 just redoing every old episode
01:57:22 commenting on the old ones
01:57:24 People love your old content
01:57:26 like all the people pitching about
01:57:28 the old days
01:57:30 They can give them what they want
01:57:32 the old episodes again
01:57:34 like the exact same episode
01:57:36 commentary tracks
01:57:38 We literally scripted it
01:57:40 we would get the transcript
01:57:42 and then say the things again
01:57:44 If somebody is not there
01:57:46 play your new person
01:57:48 I give you
01:57:50 we hire a bunch of actors
01:57:52 I give you a live
01:57:54 I'm imagining it at a local theatre
01:57:56 like on stage
01:57:58 in front of a curtain
01:58:00 just people standing there
01:58:02 with scripts doing a live reading
01:58:04 a live performance of
01:58:06 episode 4 of the program
01:58:08 they think it's just like a fucking podcast
01:58:10 or something but they don't understand
01:58:12 every single line has been prescripted
01:58:14 This is starting to become an actual good idea
01:58:16 It's kind of funny
01:58:18 the idea of doing commentary
01:58:20 has always been funny to me
01:58:22 the idea of doing commentary
01:58:24 let's play is already commentary
01:58:26 only you're not the director
01:58:28 so I did a video once that was commentary
01:58:30 on my first let's play video
01:58:32 and I was like this is my commentary on my thoughts
01:58:34 and then I immediately did a commentary on that video
01:58:36 and then I did a commentary on that video
01:58:38 I did that I was like I got 4 deep
01:58:40 and then I stopped
01:58:42 the commentary on a commentary
01:58:44 but on a podcast is like extra funny
01:58:46 because it's already pure audio
01:58:48 it would be so hard to tell
01:58:50 especially if it wasn't some of the same voices
01:58:52 it is hard
01:58:54 it's very confusing
01:58:56 what if we literally do that
01:58:58 and we get the transcript
01:59:00 the closed captions from a video
01:59:02 and we just re-record a re-performance of it
01:59:04 and we make it a bonus
01:59:06 we're doing it
01:59:08 we're fucking doing it
01:59:10 do we have that
01:59:12 on our channel
01:59:14 do we have to enable that
01:59:16 or is it just automatic
01:59:18 there's automatic captions
01:59:20 the captions are pretty decent now
01:59:22 the automatic ones
01:59:24 if you have some specific proper nouns
01:59:26 it might not get but for the most part it's pretty good
01:59:28 you don't even need to hire someone
01:59:30 you could but you can also just use
01:59:32 the AI text to speech has gotten pretty good
01:59:34 you can just synthesize new cast members
01:59:36 here's what we do
01:59:38 we replace everybody who's not here
01:59:40 on the podcast
01:59:42 just run their scripts through all the
01:59:44 Pony video audio generators
01:59:46 so we just have Twilight and Applejack
01:59:48 we're placing Trixie and Nate
01:59:50 and all the other stuff
01:59:54 that's the final stage of the podcast
01:59:56 is you actually talking to the Ponies
01:59:58 it's where we've been heading this whole time
02:00:02 speaking of Pony
02:00:04 have you seen the trailer
02:00:06 for the new movie
02:00:08 I did
02:00:10 I didn't actually watch it but I've been seeing images
02:00:12 from it
02:00:14 it looks like really
02:00:16 really lame
02:00:18 you wouldn't have expected much else
02:00:20 but it was just like
02:00:22 no jokes in the trailer landed
02:00:24 at all
02:00:26 I saw people saying that that one Pony looks like
02:00:28 she's the daughter of
02:00:30 Mordecai and Twilight
02:00:32 oh yeah with the blue hair or whatever
02:00:34 that meme is pretty funny
02:00:36 cutie mark even has like three little things
02:00:38 coming off it that looks like Mordecai's tail feathers
02:00:40 like it's a bit of a stretch
02:00:42 but it's like
02:00:44 it's not the biggest stretch
02:00:46 it just seems very generic
02:00:48 it seems like what you would have expected
02:00:50 G4 to be going into it I guess
02:00:52 yeah
02:00:54 back to the same old like corporate nothing
02:00:56 well now they have like a huge
02:00:58 fan base of like
02:01:00 there are obviously always been some my little Pony fans
02:01:02 but I feel nothing now they can make some generic shit
02:01:04 and it would still probably sell really well
02:01:06 so they're like hey let's just make some generic shit
02:01:08 it's got
02:01:10 they really reinvigorated the brand
02:01:12 with G4 they don't have to try that hard
02:01:14 all the people who have the content
02:01:16 they have to make the content
02:01:18 by reacting to the episodes
02:01:20 they'll drive up the engagement
02:01:22 people bitching about the Pony's and saying how ugly they are
02:01:24 and how bad they are and how not good they are
02:01:26 Dr. Wolf is making bank
02:01:28 Dr. Wolf's not wasting any of this content
02:01:30 he's monetizing his every thought
02:01:32 there's a lot of the bronies who really
02:01:34 stuck through it and they never once
02:01:36 even considered covering a different
02:01:38 show or something and they just
02:01:40 they're just gonna wait until the next fucking generation
02:01:42 of Pony shit comes out fucking
02:01:44 I know my niche
02:01:46 they've been doing it for 10 years
02:01:48 can you imagine being a content creator
02:01:50 that just stuck to one topic
02:01:52 and that was it
02:01:54 I mean
02:01:56 maybe I would have more money
02:01:58 were you gonna pivot to being a full time
02:02:00 sonichu channel now
02:02:02 me
02:02:04 no, full time Winnie the Pooper
02:02:06 oh yeah, hell yeah dude
02:02:08 if Chris was releasing
02:02:10 monthly updates I might
02:02:12 I don't know, no I wouldn't do
02:02:14 no, no I couldn't do it
02:02:16 I couldn't do it, I don't have it
02:02:18 it's one thing to do if there's actually something to talk about
02:02:20 it's one thing if you have to just make up shit
02:02:22 to get angry about it
02:02:24 read a new tweet that says the same thing
02:02:26 another deranged tweet that's exactly like all the ones
02:02:28 as he always makes
02:02:30 Ben just doesn't have it in him
02:02:32 to be too successful
02:02:34 no
02:02:36 oh you think you're too good to read tweets
02:02:38 just as a hardcore anti-capitalist
02:02:40 can't let yourself get too successful
02:02:42 otherwise you might get seduced
02:02:44 by the system
02:02:46 I gotta, you know it's like
02:02:48 that's why I love Bernie Sanders so much
02:02:50 he knew that like if he actually
02:02:52 won anything it would just defeat the whole
02:02:54 point so he has to
02:02:56 he's just there to give people hope
02:02:58 he's not actually there to fix it
02:03:00 controlled opposition
02:03:02 he had to do a classic
02:03:04 pratfall
02:03:06 pivot to, pivot crash and burn at the last
02:03:08 minute and you know he pulled it off
02:03:10 crash and burn
02:03:12 he's a comedian at heart
02:03:14 it really was like a perfect example of like a
02:03:16 sideshow bob stepping on a million rakes
02:03:18 and he was like he pulled it off with a plum
02:03:20 I'm much respected in it
02:03:22 you should never
02:03:24 seen anyone step on rakes
02:03:26 with such poise
02:03:28 such grace
02:03:30 also he wants to prove that he's legit
02:03:32 so if he actually won then you know he's
02:03:34 one of them
02:03:36 I'm glad he didn't win that we didn't have to get disappointed
02:03:38 by him winning and then not fixing everything
02:03:40 absolutely
02:03:42 nothing
02:03:44 that would have been great because then
02:03:46 once everybody realized that Bernie wasn't the answer
02:03:48 it would have taken up their pitchforks
02:03:50 that's why they couldn't let him win
02:03:52 they weren't afraid that he was going to fix everything
02:03:54 but they were afraid
02:03:56 it doesn't matter who we elect
02:03:58 it's never going to change
02:04:02 we can't let him
02:04:04 eat the carrot
02:04:06 we can't let him eat the carrot that we're dangling
02:04:08 because we only have one
02:04:10 carrot
02:04:12 you have to keep using the stick forever
02:04:14 I don't know I think you're
02:04:16 placing too much faith on people
02:04:18 people never seem to
02:04:20 learn
02:04:22 that idea
02:04:24 I don't actually think
02:04:26 they would learn a lesson from any
02:04:28 from anything that happened
02:04:30 I think you're probably right
02:04:32 history
02:04:34 is doomed to repeat itself
02:04:36 at least that means
02:04:38 we're going to get a few more good sonic games
02:04:40 before it's over
02:04:42 wait because Bernie's going to
02:04:44 well if history is going to repeat itself
02:04:46 we're going to get to go through the 90s again
02:04:48 oh
02:04:50 yeah I guess you're right
02:04:52 but the problem is it's not going to happen until
02:04:54 the 2000
02:04:56 ah god
02:04:58 I need to put myself in sort of Walt Disney
02:05:00 cryo storage or something
02:05:02 wasn't there a plague in like 1920
02:05:04 yes there was
02:05:06 and there was another one in 2020
02:05:08 there was also one in 1820
02:05:10 yeah the spanish window was like 100 years ago
02:05:12 yeah I heard about that one
02:05:14 yeah
02:05:16 anyway speaking of
02:05:18 speaking of elected officials
02:05:20 I have the lord of ghosts
02:05:22 the lord mayor of ghosts
02:05:24 is with me
02:05:26 the plush exists
02:05:28 and he's here right now
02:05:30 he's got his funny little hand
02:05:32 spent so much on shipping
02:05:34 he's on the podcast
02:05:36 oh god I gotta
02:05:38 I guess I've got her
02:05:40 wait you're not shipping them like now are you
02:05:42 changing my address in
02:05:44 this is just the
02:05:46 sample I've been waiting to see it
02:05:48 in person he looks great
02:05:50 and he's squishy
02:05:52 and he's like you can pick him up and throw him
02:05:54 no problem
02:05:56 that's important
02:05:58 that's what you want
02:06:00 he's adorable and now I have
02:06:02 something that I can like fashion a little
02:06:04 the little like ghost costume
02:06:06 it's going to be like the size
02:06:08 of a like a handkerchief
02:06:10 which is super adorable
02:06:12 I'm gonna have to figure out how to make those in bulk
02:06:14 but yeah
02:06:16 things are happening it's exciting
02:06:18 but also terrifying
02:06:20 yeah now you have to do it now you have all this responsibility
02:06:22 I have to keep track
02:06:24 of everybody who pledged
02:06:26 and how much they pledged and if anybody
02:06:28 wants like a plush
02:06:30 I haven't ordered them yet
02:06:32 and if they want one I can
02:06:34 maybe like accommodate
02:06:36 adding that to like
02:06:38 a thing that I'll figure it out
02:06:40 I need to like ask everybody before
02:06:42 I start buying stuff because
02:06:44 some people may have changed their minds I know Tom
02:06:46 wanted one so I have to like buy
02:06:48 an extra I couldn't believe this
02:06:50 I was looking at the battle gem ponies
02:06:52 Kickstarter
02:06:54 and I saw that there is apparently an
02:06:56 option to like add to
02:06:58 a Kickstarter tier
02:07:00 you can add like optional bonuses where
02:07:02 you can like hit a button and be like okay I want this tier
02:07:04 but I'll also add like five dollars
02:07:06 and I'll also get this add-on to it
02:07:08 or I'll add ten dollars and I'll get this other add-on
02:07:10 and like I had no idea
02:07:12 you could do that
02:07:14 on Kickstarter that was like exactly
02:07:16 the feature that like
02:07:18 it would have been really useful for me
02:07:20 with the vapors it would have been useful for you
02:07:22 with the Lord of Ghosts and adding the plush
02:07:24 like I've never seen it before
02:07:26 I guess I'm glad it's there but I wish I knew
02:07:28 about it
02:07:30 yeah it's pretty stupid that I didn't
02:07:32 like figure that out
02:07:34 it was right there
02:07:36 I was just like oh I don't want to do anything wrong
02:07:38 I'm not even gonna click on anything
02:07:42 as long as you don't forget
02:07:44 to fulfill any rent
02:07:46 that people paid for you'll be fine
02:07:48 nobody would ever want me
02:07:50 to rent about anything
02:07:52 that's impossible
02:07:54 who could think of such a thing
02:08:00 well we've been going we've been ranting
02:08:02 and raving for
02:08:04 almost
02:08:06 we're almost at two hours now
02:08:08 I'm trying to think was there anything that
02:08:10 I fucking had to
02:08:12 bring up this Wii anything I wanted
02:08:14 to mention
02:08:16 that I didn't already touch on
02:08:18 maybe maybe not
02:08:20 last week did I mention the funny thing
02:08:22 about
02:08:24 when May and Ethan Ralph
02:08:26 went to the arrest took a Christian
02:08:28 arrest
02:08:30 he says you know my friend Ben's name
02:08:32 did I mention that before?
02:08:34 I don't know if you mentioned it I saw that
02:08:36 you got fucking name dropped
02:08:38 I got name dropped
02:08:40 I didn't see that
02:08:46 I don't know
02:08:48 I just think that's really funny
02:08:50 that's really funny and bizarre
02:08:52 I guess she thought
02:08:54 your name is part of the
02:08:56 historical record
02:08:58 I'm getting arrested video
02:09:00 future historians
02:09:02 who was this mysterious Ben saint
02:09:04 that was the
02:09:06 that'll be the only artifact that exists of our civilization
02:09:08 that was the friend of
02:09:10 the holy lady
02:09:12 our lady
02:09:14 of pain
02:09:16 Pantsu party
02:09:18 the historical record
02:09:20 there's no better way
02:09:22 to get in Chris's good graces
02:09:24 than a woman who knows Ben saint
02:09:26 and see
02:09:28 what a treat
02:09:32 I guess other than that no I had
02:09:34 I didn't do anything
02:09:36 I didn't do anything
02:09:38 and I never will do anything ever again
02:09:40 what about the game Ben?
02:09:42 oh god I um
02:09:44 yeah I've been working
02:09:46 I have been working on the game
02:09:48 I made a
02:09:50 I added blood
02:09:52 I added animated blood effects
02:09:54 I've been like
02:09:56 I've been like splatter all over the world
02:09:58 it might be a little too much
02:10:00 I might dial it back and make it a little less
02:10:02 there's like a lot
02:10:04 it gets everywhere now
02:10:06 the game is no longer appropriate for children
02:10:08 I was going to make some children play it but now I can't
02:10:10 I might force some children
02:10:12 these kids in the park want to play this game
02:10:14 and they're like no
02:10:16 it's cool like body parts
02:10:18 this is important
02:10:20 and my little pony
02:10:22 spray out like a stream of blood
02:10:24 out of like the severed part
02:10:26 and like the blood like arcs across
02:10:28 like the floor and the wall and like splatters
02:10:30 and like patterns
02:10:32 it actually looks pretty cool
02:10:34 I mean it's a pretty basic but it's a
02:10:36 it's a funny effect
02:10:38 this is sounding kind of like a feature creep to me
02:10:40 you're right
02:10:42 but I've been this is a feature that I have been imagining
02:10:44 I've been thinking of adding it for a long time
02:10:46 and I finally sat down the other day
02:10:48 and I did it
02:10:50 there's only so many features that I actually need
02:10:52 there's only so many features that I actually need
02:10:54 there's only there's
02:10:56 there's no
02:10:58 I feel I feel okay
02:11:00 because this isn't like a new thing that I thought of
02:11:02 like yesterday or what the other day
02:11:04 when I was working I was like wait what if I did
02:11:06 this is a thing I'd already had like on a list
02:11:08 that I had I mean a mental list
02:11:10 but it was an old list
02:11:12 no no feature creep
02:11:14 never feature creep
02:11:16 um
02:11:18 maybe a little bit but not too much
02:11:20 just just the right amount of feature creep
02:11:22 just the right amount of crypto creep
02:11:24 yes
02:11:26 bitcoin is going to the moon
02:11:28 and you're all just jealous
02:11:30 you should add a slime coin idle game
02:11:34 oh like it's like oh
02:11:36 just in the middle of
02:11:38 in the middle of battle you can just open up your
02:11:40 your gel phone and just look at a little like
02:11:42 stock and just like trade stocks
02:11:44 like between attacks or whatever
02:11:46 it's like oh shit I gotta sell I gotta sell my
02:11:48 stock
02:11:50 you know what I'm like KFC no don't
02:11:52 it was a silly joke
02:11:54 you know what feature creep actually sounds kind of cool
02:11:56 actually it's a good thing
02:11:58 right it's like more features creeping and make
02:12:00 the game better yeah I like that
02:12:02 correct I like when the game get better
02:12:06 you can expect the release of this game in
02:12:08 2034
02:12:10 no
02:12:12 I can't even believe that that year will pass
02:12:14 someday that doesn't make sense to me
02:12:16 I remember feeling that way about
02:12:18 2021 you know what I mean like back in
02:12:20 like 2016
02:12:22 media in like 2020 like that's so far in the future
02:12:24 I'm never gonna be there
02:12:26 I felt that way about the year 2000
02:12:28 now
02:12:30 well that's weird
02:12:32 I can't imagine living in
02:12:34 an era where there's a two on the end
02:12:36 of time imagine
02:12:38 how good the world's gonna be by then
02:12:40 yeah imagine how cool
02:12:42 a technologically advanced it'll be
02:12:44 we'll have flying cars and
02:12:46 how old were you in 2000
02:12:48 I was 12
02:12:50 or 11 or 12
02:12:52 okay
02:12:54 yeah it was 11
02:12:56 I think I was a little too young to even
02:12:58 anticipate like what even that
02:13:00 means for like the millennium
02:13:02 the year 2000
02:13:04 like huh what
02:13:06 I thought that shit was crazy
02:13:08 I'm going back to playing with
02:13:10 whatever
02:13:12 these fucking zoomers who have the privilege of
02:13:14 being born in the year 2000 so they always
02:13:16 know exactly how old they are because they can just
02:13:18 look at what year it is and like oh that's how old I am
02:13:20 yeah I was thinking about that the other day
02:13:22 that's really convenient
02:13:24 well I know how old I am because
02:13:26 I just google how old is the Simpsons
02:13:28 and I'm as old as the Simpsons is
02:13:30 so
02:13:32 on a separate note that's depressing
02:13:34 as fuck I was thinking about how like Homer
02:13:36 Simpson he's like supposed to be in his 30s
02:13:38 he's like there's not like a one
02:13:40 clear canon answer but he's been
02:13:42 portrayed as 32 and 36
02:13:44 I don't want to be as old as Homer
02:13:46 Simpson though I would prefer not to be dead
02:13:48 I think there was a tweet going around where they were saying like there's one of the recent episodes
02:13:50 of the Simpsons
02:13:52 portrayed Homer as like a young Rebellies
02:13:54 teenager in the 90s and I was like
02:13:56 well they have that sliding time scale
02:13:58 because I mean yeah he's like they're not getting older
02:14:00 but things are still
02:14:02 current events are still happening so
02:14:04 okay I'm pretty sure that he
02:14:06 was canonically 39
02:14:08 but then like at some point
02:14:10 they changed it to 40
02:14:12 I always thought of him as yeah closer to 40 to be honest
02:14:14 but yeah you can find shit that
02:14:16 say is he's like in his mid 30s
02:14:18 it's not like there's one canon answer
02:14:20 like I said it's
02:14:22 I remember there's an episode where there's a
02:14:24 his crisis is that he's literally
02:14:26 he's hit the like halfway point of like the average
02:14:28 age
02:14:30 he's literally like halfway through his life because he's
02:14:32 you know he thinks he's 38
02:14:34 and
02:14:36 but he's actually he forgets that he's actually
02:14:38 39 so he's actually more than half
02:14:40 I remember there's like a bit in there
02:14:42 I wouldn't be surprised
02:14:44 it probably does vary
02:14:46 at some point they must have made like
02:14:48 a decision but made probably early on they like
02:14:50 weren't 100% sure about it
02:14:52 I googled my
02:14:54 birth year and like what happened
02:14:56 in this year and
02:14:58 I'm scrolling through and there's a lot of like
02:15:00 you would never think to remember this
02:15:02 like oh Ben Johnson
02:15:04 is banned from athletics for life
02:15:06 I don't
02:15:08 I don't know what that is
02:15:10 who is that
02:15:12 the Indonesia earthquake
02:15:14 earthquake hits flora's Indonesia
02:15:16 2200 dead
02:15:18 that's how old I am
02:15:20 sorry I only know
02:15:22 the release dates of video games I don't know
02:15:24 years
02:15:26 such a useless list
02:15:28 not world historic events
02:15:30 like stuff happens in the year
02:15:32 and it's just a bunch of
02:15:34 boring news articles
02:15:36 and like war
02:15:38 lame
02:15:40 where's the real shit
02:15:44 what video games came out that's all that matters
02:15:46 I know in 1988
02:15:48 the year Ben was born
02:15:50 is when Mario 3 came out in Japan
02:15:52 Mario 3
02:15:54 wait really
02:15:56 yeah Mario 3 came out in US
02:15:58 in 1990 and in Japan
02:16:00 it came out in 88 I believe
02:16:02 I was playing the NES
02:16:04 as a kid thinking it was like new
02:16:06 hot shit I didn't even realize
02:16:08 that it was like old busted
02:16:10 bullshit technology
02:16:12 my parents probably got it at a
02:16:14 fucking bargain Ben at the library
02:16:16 I'm kind of grateful to have grown up
02:16:18 and been able to appreciate like the Super Nintendo
02:16:20 and Genesis just to have like been there
02:16:22 for that big jump into 3D
02:16:24 like whoa it's fucking
02:16:26 3D
02:16:28 quick facts from 1993
02:16:30 world's changing event
02:16:32 Intel introduced the Pentium family
02:16:34 of 32-bit microprocessors
02:16:36 the world was never the same after that
02:16:38 it's just so rememberable
02:16:40 I remember seeing
02:16:42 it wasn't like a commercial
02:16:44 for the Game Boy Advance
02:16:46 it was like a commercial for like
02:16:48 McDonald's
02:16:50 and McDonald's was doing like a Mario
02:16:52 tie-in
02:16:54 doing some kind of like tie-in promotion
02:16:56 with like Mario 64
02:16:58 or something
02:17:00 and they fucking
02:17:02 the commercial showed a Game Boy
02:17:04 color or maybe it was a Game Boy Advance
02:17:06 I think it was something like Mario 64 on the Game Boy color
02:17:08 I think I remember that commercial
02:17:10 and I remember being pissed off and like you can't do that
02:17:12 technology I wish I had that
02:17:14 like oh my god a handheld with 3D graphics
02:17:16 I can't even fucking believe this
02:17:18 if I could just have Mario 64
02:17:20 in a handheld I'd be so happy
02:17:22 that it happened on the fucking DS
02:17:24 and it was like whatever it's fine
02:17:26 I think one of the biggest
02:17:28 I played it in like a week because that was cool
02:17:30 look at this fucking this thing
02:17:32 the conversation Ted Danson
02:17:34 wore black place and used the N word
02:17:36 at girlfriend whoopee Goldberg's roast
02:17:38 at the Friars Club
02:17:40 this looks like it was like AI generated list
02:17:42 it says the most famous person in America
02:17:44 was probably
02:17:46 where did you find this list
02:17:48 I'm just googling place it like
02:17:50 pop culture all of facts and trivia
02:17:52 I remember the shipping news
02:17:54 by E. Annie Prowles
02:17:56 had the price of a Domino's Pizza
02:17:58 two toppings in 1993
02:18:00 it was a different time
02:18:02 back then you could wear black face
02:18:04 and say the N word it was okay in those days
02:18:06 it was a different time
02:18:08 it was charming
02:18:10 cool and epic as a matter of fact
02:18:14 Intel introduced a Pentium
02:18:16 there used to be a micro process
02:18:18 pretty good
02:18:20 okay I guess Dune came out
02:18:22 that's a pretty big release
02:18:26 is it the initial yeah 10th of December
02:18:28 1993
02:18:30 like Ted Danson wore black face
02:18:32 and used the N word at girlfriend
02:18:34 whoopee Goldberg's roast
02:18:36 at the Friars Club
02:18:38 we gotta cancel Ted Danson what the fuck
02:18:40 is going on here we gotta dig up this roast
02:18:42 how old are you
02:18:44 remember when Ted Danson said the N word
02:18:46 you remember that
02:18:48 you remember the rascal Ted Danson
02:18:50 I'm trying to imagine like what the context
02:18:52 was that like maybe at the time
02:18:54 not everyone thought
02:18:56 that was like really
02:18:58 cringe to do
02:19:00 hmm
02:19:02 the 90s was a world before cringe existed
02:19:04 everybody just did everything genuinely
02:19:06 and nobody was embarrassed
02:19:08 by anything
02:19:10 there's only once YouTube and the internet existed
02:19:12 that cringe culture came into being
02:19:14 well it wasn't that long ago
02:19:16 that the PCP used to
02:19:18 say the N word quite often
02:19:20 we're just like Ted Danson
02:19:22 we're even better
02:19:24 we said it even more
02:19:26 than Ted Danson did
02:19:28 and later so for all you know
02:19:30 we were in black face the entire time
02:19:32 did you know
02:19:34 you can't prove that they weren't
02:19:36 did you know that behind the scenes
02:19:38 we all wore black face all up the first
02:19:40 entire year we were recording
02:19:42 and we never talked about it
02:19:44 we thought it just went without saying
02:19:46 we thought it was black face but it was actually
02:19:48 a bunch of soot like we were in Mary Poppins
02:19:50 and we were cleaning the chimneys
02:19:52 because well you see because
02:19:54 we had all been holding like we had all
02:19:56 collectively been holding a large cartoon
02:19:58 bomb that had like exploded at us
02:20:00 and you know covered us
02:20:02 and that's basically what it was like in the 90s
02:20:04 it was a lot like the early PCP episodes
02:20:08 in a roundabout sort of way
02:20:10 good times
02:20:12 those were the days
02:20:14 love that cartoon ball
02:20:18 celestine prophecy
02:20:20 classic a classic
02:20:26 game of the year
02:20:28 game of the year of the year of your birth
02:20:32 what do you got?
02:20:34 let's compare like year birth games
02:20:36 who's got the best gamer
02:20:38 we're pretty sure
02:20:40 I'm slightly miffed
02:20:42 I'm one year early to be Sonic the Hedgehog
02:20:44 so I have to say Super Mario World
02:20:50 that's a pretty good one
02:20:52 it is a good game
02:20:54 from the year I was born
02:20:56 I'm going to deal with ones that were released in America
02:20:58 Super Mario Bros. 2
02:21:00 was released in America
02:21:02 see I don't even need to do this because we have the same birth
02:21:04 so whatever your answer
02:21:06 let me just take it
02:21:10 Master Blaster
02:21:12 damn
02:21:14 I might win I've got Mega Man X
02:21:16 Monopoly on the Sega Master System
02:21:20 it's Mega Man X
02:21:22 the secret man of this doom
02:21:24 Disney's Aladdin on Genesis
02:21:26 Mega Man X kind of came out in 94
02:21:28 in US I think
02:21:30 in 93 in Japan
02:21:32 I didn't click on the thing
02:21:34 Zelda came out in 1988
02:21:36 so that's pretty good
02:21:38 that's pretty solid
02:21:40 I thought it was 1987
02:21:42 not according to computer gaming world magazine
02:21:46 why is it always got to be like you gotta check things
02:21:50 I typed in it in google and I have to go and check
02:21:54 what year it came out in what country
02:21:58 actually something that fascinated me is that
02:22:00 with some really old games
02:22:02 they actually don't know when they came out exactly
02:22:04 because they used to not keep track of that sort of thing as much
02:22:08 like there's a big debate
02:22:10 as to when the original Super Mario Bros. came out
02:22:14 some people say it was 1985
02:22:16 others say it was 1986
02:22:20 it was an actual year
02:22:22 package with the NES
02:22:24 with like Duck Hunt cartridge
02:22:26 well Nintendo officially lists it
02:22:28 as 1985
02:22:30 but the NES only had a limited release in the US in 1985
02:22:34 it was only released like in a couple of cities
02:22:38 and I think it wasn't until 1986
02:22:40 that the NES had a
02:22:44 a release across the entire country
02:22:46 okay riddle me this Nintendo
02:22:48 you say it's called the family computer
02:22:51 then why does it only play games for babies
02:22:53 explain that to me
02:22:55 where's the porn
02:22:57 where's the porn games
02:22:59 and a spreadsheet accounting software
02:23:01 for mommy and dad
02:23:03 the Famicom actually did have
02:23:05 a couple of antigames
02:23:09 I need my adult themes
02:23:11 and situations
02:23:13 and mature situations
02:23:15 I need to be titillated
02:23:18 I need the Famicom to do a fucking digital
02:23:20 striptease for me on my television set
02:23:23 you ever seen a Takeshi's challenge
02:23:25 I think it was called
02:23:27 I've seen the Jontron
02:23:29 video about it
02:23:31 it was popular before Jontron did a video on it
02:23:33 yeah but I'd never heard of it before that
02:23:37 I think maybe AVGN did a video on it first
02:23:39 but I'm not sure
02:23:41 maybe he did it after
02:23:43 wait what game
02:23:45 Takeshi's challenge
02:23:47 no I don't think AVGN did that
02:23:49 Jontron did that one
02:23:51 yes that's what I remember
02:23:55 uhhhh
02:23:57 are we still looking at
02:23:59 video game years
02:24:01 legend is all though
02:24:03 can you imagine being an old enough piece of shit
02:24:05 to play Atari games
02:24:07 and enjoy them
02:24:09 even though they suck
02:24:11 I watch this youtube channel
02:24:13 sometimes called Kim Justice
02:24:15 and Kim Justice talks
02:24:17 about
02:24:19 pre-NES games
02:24:21 in Britain
02:24:23 and Britain
02:24:25 they had the Zidic Spectrum
02:24:27 the Zidic Spectrum
02:24:29 UK didn't get games
02:24:31 from the rest of the world until
02:24:33 the NES
02:24:35 they had their own homebrew
02:24:37 they had a whole different video game scene
02:24:39 guys are there, they love Dizzy
02:24:41 the Ig, they love that guy
02:24:43 they have all sorts of weird shit they like
02:24:45 the second master system is not popular in the UK
02:24:47 I think
02:24:49 this is in the late 80s
02:24:51 that one where you're the little guy
02:24:53 Kim
02:24:55 there's like one of like a bunch of sequels
02:24:57 she's made a
02:24:59 sort of a documentary about the life of this like
02:25:01 kid who like made this game
02:25:03 where you're a guy running around like a hotel
02:25:05 and it was like a
02:25:07 huge fucking hit
02:25:09 it was like a massive success in the UK
02:25:11 and nowhere else and the guy was like
02:25:13 a fucking rockstar and he like
02:25:15 got into drugs and like burnt out
02:25:17 really young after making one sequel
02:25:19 and like he had like a whole
02:25:21 like rise and fall like celebrity
02:25:23 that's just so weird to me you're like a rockstar
02:25:25 video game dev but like in the fucking
02:25:27 late 80s when all the games sucked
02:25:29 basically again I'm not even trying to be mean
02:25:31 but like Atari games are just so primitive
02:25:33 that they're just like they're basically like
02:25:35 unplayable by today's standards again but it's just
02:25:37 weird to me like imagine video games don't even exist
02:25:39 like you don't even know I mean I guess Pong existed
02:25:41 and then like all of a sudden there's this new
02:25:43 thing called Atari you probably think it's pretty cool
02:25:45 but like it's impossible to show it to a
02:25:47 kid nowadays and have them actually be
02:25:49 interested in it
02:25:51 let me let me let me show you
02:25:53 there are probably some good Atari games
02:25:55 let me show you the game this guy made
02:25:57 this guy was um
02:25:59 was like living this rockstar lifestyle
02:26:01 off of it looked like it looked like
02:26:03 I'm gonna post a script this
02:26:05 it's called Jet Set Willy
02:26:07 this guy was like
02:26:09 because I remember hearing Jet Set in the titles
02:26:11 like what the fuck is going on but yeah just a weird ass game
02:26:13 is that the prequel of Jet Set Radio
02:26:15 that's what I thought but I don't think so
02:26:19 I think I think this is the sequel
02:26:21 this is number two I think
02:26:23 I've seen games that look like this before
02:26:25 but I forgot what it was called
02:26:27 but I played actually
02:26:29 a ZX Spectrum game once
02:26:31 in Donkey Kong 64
02:26:33 there's a mini game where you can play
02:26:35 a ZX
02:26:37 Jetpack, that's the one
02:26:39 you can play that
02:26:41 it's I think the real original
02:26:43 version of the game
02:26:45 Rareware got their start making ZX Spectrum games
02:26:47 so yeah you can
02:26:49 find a few of them on like the Rare
02:26:51 Replay or whatever
02:26:53 I actually thought Jetpack was pretty cool
02:26:55 even though it's a very simplistic
02:26:57 primitive game
02:26:59 I thought it was not so bad
02:27:01 it's kind of fun to play for a couple of minutes at a time
02:27:03 right yeah I
02:27:05 was sort of being comedic in how
02:27:07 overly harsh I am I know there are some good old
02:27:09 games it's just like they're rarer
02:27:11 and you find a lot of just bullshit that sucks
02:27:13 and you have to use your imagination
02:27:15 which is the last thing I want to be doing when I'm playing a video game
02:27:17 I play that to have
02:27:19 imagery force fed to me not so I can imagine
02:27:21 things
02:27:23 door fortress
02:27:25 I mean it's easy
02:27:27 to make fun but like I'm doing
02:27:29 some game dev shit and I have like software
02:27:31 that's specifically built for it
02:27:33 imagine trying to make this
02:27:35 you have to like program
02:27:37 it must be really hard to make games
02:27:39 like draw the sprite
02:27:41 you have to like I remember seeing
02:27:43 like
02:27:45 for Mario or whatever they have like
02:27:47 paper where they would draw
02:27:49 yeah they drew it on graph paper
02:27:51 like where the pixels would be and then they would have to
02:27:53 type up like okay this coordinate
02:27:55 here draw this pixel
02:27:57 and they would do that
02:27:59 and then that's how they would draw pixel art
02:28:01 so it was incredibly difficult for them
02:28:03 to make fine
02:28:05 tune changes to the levels
02:28:07 since they
02:28:09 they'd have to draw it on the graph paper
02:28:11 first and go back and
02:28:13 type in the code to change something
02:28:15 mm-hmm
02:28:17 yeah that
02:28:19 sounds about the size of it
02:28:21 I think also back then they had to use
02:28:23 like certain
02:28:25 ROM cartridges that would
02:28:27 only be erased
02:28:29 if you shined light into
02:28:31 the ship
02:28:33 add like a little hole for ultra
02:28:35 violet light
02:28:37 what
02:28:39 I don't even understand
02:28:41 that's wild
02:28:43 you mean like to
02:28:45 erase data
02:28:47 they had to like sack it
02:28:49 that is weird I was not aware of that
02:28:51 but it was just a feature
02:28:53 I completely had the weird arcade technology like that
02:28:55 it was like it was a read only
02:28:57 memory ship but you can erase
02:28:59 the data on it by
02:29:01 shining light into a little hole on the ship
02:29:03 you have to like manually do it
02:29:05 yeah I think they had to
02:29:07 manually do this kind of thing back then
02:29:09 it was pretty
02:29:11 inconvenient you know making games back then
02:29:13 was very difficult
02:29:15 that's why it's pretty impressive
02:29:17 I always had my mind blown
02:29:19 I had like small of like disk space
02:29:21 you know they had to work with those games
02:29:23 like in the original Super Mario Bros they had to reuse
02:29:25 like the fucking clouds as the bushes and shit
02:29:27 you know what I mean because just anywhere to save
02:29:29 a little bit of space
02:29:31 that's why a lot of the levels are kind of samey
02:29:33 but it's impressive
02:29:35 they were able to make a you know a pretty
02:29:37 playable game off of
02:29:39 the technology they had at the time
02:29:41 you ever watch those videos there's a guy
02:29:43 who does like sort of like how it works
02:29:45 like old gaming tech and he
02:29:47 there's one where he explains like
02:29:49 he explains why missing no looks the way it does
02:29:51 but in the course
02:29:53 is that the 8-bit guy
02:29:55 it's not the 8-bit guy
02:29:57 no that's a different guy
02:29:59 LGR
02:30:01 um
02:30:03 why missing no
02:30:05 I haven't seen that video specifically but
02:30:07 I think maybe I know you're talking about
02:30:09 I think it's called missing no
02:30:11 explained
02:30:13 I may have seen this video it's ringing some bells
02:30:15 but yeah it is interesting hearing just like
02:30:17 the exact minutiae of like
02:30:19 like why does it come out is this weird
02:30:21 garbled box like what exactly is it trying to do
02:30:23 you know what I mean
02:30:25 is it like explaining how
02:30:27 it like it's it decides
02:30:29 to be printed in that weird
02:30:31 pattern like we all know why
02:30:33 there's a glitch but like is he going into like
02:30:35 it's called it's called
02:30:37 the channel is called retro game mechanics
02:30:39 explained the video is called missing
02:30:41 those glitchy appearance explained
02:30:43 and it's basically I mean
02:30:45 he he he says he
02:30:47 explains why missing no has that sprite
02:30:49 and he and to do so he has to
02:30:51 explain the whole like process by which
02:30:53 Pokemon sprite data
02:30:55 this is a good video and then like
02:30:57 translated and compressed and stuff
02:30:59 I appreciate anyone who will go to like
02:31:01 I've seen lengths to like
02:31:03 like look at this the visualizations that he
02:31:05 does to like don't like
02:31:07 I need to explain to me very basically
02:31:09 you know what I mean so for me to understand
02:31:11 something of this like when he's pulling out the math
02:31:13 and shit I'm like okay oh this this is good
02:31:15 I want to watch this
02:31:17 this is a good video yeah I like I appreciate anyone
02:31:19 who's like oh did you know this
02:31:21 missing no is a thing that happens
02:31:23 right right right this is
02:31:25 just glitching this you know it's like a
02:31:27 why why is it like you know
02:31:29 missing no is a
02:31:31 a very mysterious thing to have discovered
02:31:33 as a kid
02:31:35 because it's kind of like the father
02:31:37 or mother of all glitches it's
02:31:39 it's quite amazing
02:31:41 yeah I remember it was really cool
02:31:43 it was like yeah it wasn't hard to do
02:31:45 but it was like you had to do these weird
02:31:47 esoteric steps which were easy to
02:31:49 explain luckily and it's so weird to
02:31:51 me how it could like fuck up your game it
02:31:53 like clone your items
02:31:55 it's accessible and you can do it
02:31:57 and it's fun how it
02:31:59 sort of works like it's sort of you can
02:32:01 sort of just use it as a pokemon
02:32:03 kind of and it like does things to your
02:32:05 game that are like it breaks your game
02:32:07 but like it doesn't break it's so bad that
02:32:09 like it doesn't work it doesn't like hard crash the game
02:32:11 it actually has like you can like put your master
02:32:13 ball or rare candy in a certain slot and get
02:32:15 infinite which is like incredibly useful I mean
02:32:17 sort of breaks a game and like makes it too easy
02:32:19 blah blah blah but you know as a kid I didn't
02:32:21 give a fuck about that I was just like whoa this is epic
02:32:23 it was a really easy glitch pull off
02:32:25 but it was just so
02:32:27 weird it didn't make sense how it
02:32:29 work and
02:32:31 as a kid I couldn't figure out if the developers
02:32:33 did this on an on purpose
02:32:35 or if it was
02:32:37 not on purpose it was just
02:32:39 it just didn't make sense until I got older
02:32:41 it was hard to imagine like yeah how could there be like
02:32:43 accidentally put a pokemon in the game with like
02:32:45 a unique name and sprite like how does
02:32:47 accidentally happen to like oh yeah exactly
02:32:49 these aren't on purpose these are like default error
02:32:51 messages basically like missing number
02:32:53 means like we couldn't find the fucking pokemon's name
02:32:55 just crazy that so much
02:32:57 comes up from just this one
02:32:59 uh tiny error
02:33:01 it is cool I like to think of how much like
02:33:03 people who are like inspired by missing know just
02:33:05 in terms of like glitch hunting and just people
02:33:07 make their own games so they're inspired probably
02:33:09 not directly but just like that kind of glitchy
02:33:11 shit is inspired like creepypasta to you know
02:33:13 just some degree which is actually I was gonna say that
02:33:15 inspired by other games missing know actually kind
02:33:17 of scared me a little bit as a kid because
02:33:19 it felt like a creepypasta
02:33:21 it is like it's basically
02:33:23 like a creepypasta that's what creepypastas are all like
02:33:25 they all have that start off it's like a missing
02:33:27 no shit well you have to go here and do all this obscure
02:33:29 shit that's like a reason why you know
02:33:31 no one else has found this hidden ghost
02:33:33 bullshit in the game it's interesting
02:33:37 as like when you're a kid you you think
02:33:39 that uh your game got
02:33:41 infected by a ghost
02:33:43 virus or something I was very
02:33:45 you know when I realized
02:33:47 that that it had corrupted my
02:33:49 I didn't realize until later that it would
02:33:51 corrupted my elite four data and I was
02:33:53 very bummed I was very bummed about that
02:33:55 the first time I got
02:33:57 like poisoned in Pokemon
02:33:59 I thought the game was glitching out because it
02:34:01 went you know does the whole
02:34:03 thing with it when you walk a few steps
02:34:05 it beeps and it flashes and I'm
02:34:07 like oh shit I did
02:34:09 I do something wrong oh no the game's gonna break
02:34:11 I'm gonna get in trouble
02:34:13 I was very scared very
02:34:15 upset I had no idea that's
02:34:17 what the poison was your first explosion of poison mechanic
02:34:19 yeah it's not it doesn't make sense and that is
02:34:21 why I mean it's not they don't explain it but like
02:34:23 it's easy to have it happen to you and not know
02:34:25 what's going on for the first time so
02:34:27 that's fine and eventually the Pokemon fainted
02:34:29 and I was like oh it's a thing that was going
02:34:31 on
02:34:33 I love that feeling when you think the game
02:34:35 is breaking and then you realize oh that's just a mechanic
02:34:37 yeah that's a great feeling
02:34:41 that's what
02:34:43 that's what eternal darkness does on purpose
02:34:49 you have the sanity mechanic
02:34:51 and as you lose sanity
02:34:53 the game tries to trick you into thinking
02:34:55 more games haven't ripped off the sanity meter
02:34:57 but I guess it's like a trick that doesn't you know
02:34:59 it only really works when it's novel
02:35:01 and fresh you know what I mean
02:35:03 I don't think many people remember eternal darkness
02:35:05 it's like mainstream
02:35:07 right you know I don't know what that is
02:35:09 not anymore
02:35:11 everyone's practically forgotten about it
02:35:13 now but it was a
02:35:15 pretty interesting mechanic
02:35:20 the end
02:35:21 so fucked up the end
02:35:23 thanks for listening
02:35:25 that's the end of the procrastinator's podcast
02:35:27 it's voicemails
02:35:29 do you have enough time left on your recording for voicemails
02:35:31 oh no I cleared some data
02:35:33 I cleared some data I'm good
02:35:35 I have space for 17 more hours
02:35:37 and I intend to go
02:35:39 alright we have a 17 hour episode baby
02:35:41 break out the record
02:35:43 I have space for 52 more hours
02:35:45 I don't know I can keep going
02:35:47 fuck
02:35:49 you just deleted all of his porn files
02:35:51 no I would never
02:35:53 Ben just deleted all of his game files
02:35:55 if anything I do placate it
02:35:59 let's see
02:36:01 here
02:36:03 alright the first voicemail
02:36:05 do I have this numbered correctly
02:36:07 let me make sure that I'm starting at the
02:36:09 at the beginning
02:36:11 first voicemail is called
02:36:13 lord of kickstarter trailers
02:36:15 let me find it
02:36:17 it is number 3528
02:36:19 there it is
02:36:21 putting it in
02:36:23 I'm in the wrong channel
02:36:25 I'm looking at the wrong channel
02:36:27 okay putting it in general
02:36:29 there sorry this is taking a second
02:36:31 okay lord of kickstarter trailers
02:36:33 let's go in 3, 2, 1, go
02:36:37 even though the lord of ghosts kickstarter
02:36:39 is already funded I keep coming back
02:36:41 to the page just to rewatch
02:36:43 the like trailer announcement video
02:36:45 thing because it's so good
02:36:47 it's so funny
02:36:49 it's evergreen even though it is
02:36:51 about a limited time event
02:36:53 the video alone
02:36:55 is worth the money that I pledged
02:36:57 thank you gib for making
02:36:59 for being epic
02:37:01 you're welcome
02:37:03 it's a funny video I love the
02:37:05 sports theme
02:37:07 I saw tim and eric live once they did it
02:37:09 sports live it was cute
02:37:11 I have not seen it just think it comes from
02:37:13 that reminds me of
02:37:15 when John and Aaron used to do
02:37:17 those videos advertising
02:37:19 when they're going to do
02:37:21 some kind of new content
02:37:23 and sometimes those videos were funnier
02:37:25 than the actual things they were doing
02:37:27 or advertising
02:37:29 yeah I used to like the skits
02:37:31 for like oh crunchyroll subscription
02:37:33 or a new t-shirt
02:37:35 and they that was
02:37:37 those were good
02:37:39 I definitely wanted that video to be
02:37:41 like I remember
02:37:43 the punk plush kickstarter where I
02:37:45 was just sort of explaining what it was
02:37:47 in front of a camera
02:37:49 and I don't think I think that was
02:37:51 kind of lame
02:37:53 I wanted this one to be like memorable and fun
02:37:55 and cool and people like oh
02:37:57 I'm excited about this now
02:37:59 I did it I think
02:38:01 better to do something that like
02:38:03 gets the energy across
02:38:05 than to do something that just like
02:38:07 explains what it is but without like
02:38:09 you know
02:38:11 an impact
02:38:13 yeah making the impact is the important
02:38:15 thing
02:38:17 explaining things in front of a camera that's a
02:38:19 very tricksy move
02:38:21 I mean it's normal
02:38:23 it's a normal thing
02:38:25 to do
02:38:27 ranting about
02:38:29 the lord of the ghost kickstarter
02:38:31 yes
02:38:33 the next voicemail
02:38:35 is called
02:38:37 another poem
02:38:39 oh my god my computer
02:38:41 it's called another poem for ben sains
02:38:43 3
02:38:45 2 1 go
02:38:47 as I open my eyes my mind
02:38:49 is set no more setbacks
02:38:51 no more regret it seems
02:38:53 I've come up with a perfect plan
02:38:55 I'll tie my artistic brand to Christian
02:38:57 I just can't stop
02:38:59 merging my comic is sure to get lots
02:39:01 of clicks I just can't stop
02:39:03 merging come watch my lecture
02:39:05 get your christery fix
02:39:07 I just can't stop merging
02:39:09 a canon end for this tale of strife
02:39:11 I just can't stop merging
02:39:13 what am I doing with my life
02:39:15 hey
02:39:17 so
02:39:19 I enjoy it
02:39:21 I enjoy it
02:39:23 I think we can all find that
02:39:25 relatable who among us hasn't
02:39:27 you just got merged on
02:39:29 in this kind of situation
02:39:31 who here hasn't done a lecture on chris
02:39:33 who here hasn't invariably
02:39:35 tied their brand to chris chan
02:39:37 at some point or another
02:39:39 who hasn't merged their canons
02:39:41 together
02:39:43 into a strange bizarre
02:39:45 crossover story of
02:39:47 things nobody has ever heard of
02:39:49 not I
02:39:51 okay
02:39:53 the next voicemail is called
02:39:57 an elegy for a fallen hero
02:40:03 an elegy
02:40:05 but the next one says ignore the previous one
02:40:07 but I'm not going to ignore the previous one
02:40:09 elegy for a fallen hero
02:40:11 3, 2, 1, go
02:40:15 it was a battle of the pcp
02:40:21 maybe you watch
02:40:23 what he took of me
02:40:29 no matter how I try
02:40:31 I could not break free
02:40:37 and he maybe eased his slasps
02:40:39 I think this is a resend
02:40:41 yeah maybe they accidentally
02:40:43 posted this one but it was good still
02:40:45 it's good
02:40:47 even the voicemails you accidentally resend
02:40:49 are getting played on the podcast
02:40:51 don't filter these
02:40:53 okay this one is called
02:40:55 oh god it's a minute long
02:40:57 this one is called ignore the last one
02:40:59 3, 2, 1, go
02:41:07 oh yeah I remember
02:41:13 how they told us
02:41:15 what they had been
02:41:17 and when they creamed
02:41:21 I do
02:41:23 that's what he did
02:41:43 3, 2, 1, go
02:42:13 that was lovely
02:42:15 that was incredible
02:42:17 that was incredible
02:42:19 that was
02:42:21 that was the first good voicemail to be over
02:42:23 one minute long
02:42:25 I think he did it
02:42:27 I think he did the impossible
02:42:29 it made a good long voicemail
02:42:31 you should redo the whole
02:42:33 of the wall
02:42:35 with pcp memes
02:42:37 definitely do that
02:42:39 please
02:42:41 if you can make something like this
02:42:43 why would you send it in as a voicemail
02:42:45 yeah
02:42:47 the juxtaposition of
02:42:49 putting an effort post into
02:42:51 a shitty voicemail
02:42:53 to get played 2 and a half hours deep
02:42:55 into some podcast
02:42:57 that's the appeal
02:42:59 that is its own reward
02:43:01 next voicemail
02:43:03 is called son of marowak
02:43:05 3, 2, 1, go
02:43:11 son of marowak
02:43:13 so I just got back from odicon
02:43:15 participated in the art show
02:43:17 people bid for items at an auction
02:43:19 online auction
02:43:21 the odicon
02:43:23 art stuff was asking for a lot of hentai
02:43:25 we only had about 10 pieces
02:43:27 this year
02:43:29 usually it's pretty small
02:43:31 but I'm determined
02:43:33 for the next year until the next odicon
02:43:35 I'm going to submit at least 20 to 40
02:43:37 pieces of hentai
02:43:39 it's going to be monster girls
02:43:41 I'll let you know how it goes
02:43:43 submit them for what
02:43:45 is it an art show
02:43:47 I don't understand
02:43:49 I thought he was talking about the vendor hall
02:43:51 was he talking about selling them
02:43:53 you can never have enough hentai
02:43:55 I do not know
02:43:57 the mechanics of odicon
02:43:59 I'm sorry
02:44:01 what they're being submitted for
02:44:03 but I mean good luck
02:44:05 if he's a son of marowak
02:44:07 he's a cubon
02:44:09 he's not just a cubon
02:44:11 he's a special cubon
02:44:13 I drew him on the radcon 4 poster
02:44:15 he's got a whole backstory
02:44:17 he wears a hoodie
02:44:19 he's a cubon with a hoodie
02:44:21 and he's got a special
02:44:23 you don't have to go on it
02:44:25 I was already sold on the hoodie
02:44:27 say no more
02:44:29 what if a cubon had a hoodie
02:44:31 also did you know that
02:44:33 Ethan Ralph was at odicon
02:44:35 I did
02:44:37 someone did say that
02:44:39 may drag Ethan Ralph to odicon
02:44:41 which sounds so awkward
02:44:43 I just can't imagine
02:44:45 I just
02:44:47 sounds like there's going to be some fights
02:44:49 sounds like there's going to get in fights
02:44:51 you missed a great opportunity
02:44:53 to go have a fist fight with Ethan Ralph
02:44:55 and upload the video to your channel
02:44:57 I could have done it
02:44:59 you missed out on some primo content
02:45:01 you left it on the table
02:45:03 I did
02:45:05 that's wasted content
02:45:07 the worst wasted content is the content
02:45:09 that never even happened
02:45:11 that could have been recorded
02:45:13 think of all the boxing matches
02:45:15 that aren't currently going on between YouTubers
02:45:17 think of everyone
02:45:19 in the world
02:45:21 who isn't punching someone right now
02:45:23 think of how many hundreds of boxing matches
02:45:25 that you're not participating in right now
02:45:27 you should be ashamed of yourself
02:45:29 it boggles
02:45:31 you need to get swollen
02:45:33 and start challenging
02:45:35 all the content creators to boxing matches
02:45:37 all the content creators you hate
02:45:41 I mean
02:45:43 that's one way to get my
02:45:45 revenge
02:45:47 on this world, on this bitch of an earth
02:45:49 the next voicemail
02:45:51 is called
02:45:53 Mordecai Saint
02:45:55 3, 2, 1, go
02:45:57 Ben Saint
02:45:59 is just Mordecai
02:46:01 from regular show
02:46:03 I will not be elaborating
02:46:05 cause he fucks horses
02:46:07 cause I, yeah
02:46:09 cause I fucked Twilight
02:46:11 child is in the new generation
02:46:13 is that a good show
02:46:15 regular show?
02:46:17 it looks like adventure time
02:46:19 but it doesn't have adventure in it
02:46:21 that's literally why I watched it
02:46:23 I was a big fan of adventure time
02:46:25 similar right? and I watched the first season or two
02:46:27 and it is good
02:46:29 but it's sort of a slice of life
02:46:31 shit happens
02:46:33 sometimes the funny shit happens
02:46:35 they had an episode making fun of Billy Mitchell
02:46:37 I've seen some pretty good shit
02:46:39 I like that it's just about some guys
02:46:41 working at a job
02:46:43 I really like the premise
02:46:45 and find them being groundskeepers
02:46:47 at a park
02:46:49 you ever see 4 in the ampm
02:46:51 the student film by the guy
02:46:53 he's good
02:46:55 he takes acid and he's tripping
02:46:57 he turns in the character from a regular show
02:46:59 that's just his regular voice
02:47:01 his Mordecai voice
02:47:03 J.G. Quendall
02:47:05 he's the creator of the show
02:47:07 cause you watch his new show
02:47:09 he's the exact same voice
02:47:11 yeah he's a new show on HBO Max
02:47:13 I think about being a dad guy
02:47:15 I hate it
02:47:17 I hate it
02:47:19 we were bitching together about
02:47:21 Brad Neely's new show
02:47:23 I'm not gonna say it's bad
02:47:25 but just based on the trailer
02:47:27 it didn't look interesting
02:47:29 it's another family show
02:47:31 the last thing the world needs is another show
02:47:33 about being a parent
02:47:35 adult animation cartoon
02:47:37 that looks kind of like family guy
02:47:39 and it's about
02:47:41 the only reason
02:47:43 I'll give it a shot
02:47:45 because I like Brad Neely
02:47:47 he's made some amazing shit
02:47:49 I like China the way the show
02:47:51 but the funniest thing about it
02:47:53 is Professor Bros.
02:47:55 the YouTube videos are just better
02:47:57 I don't even want to be mean about it
02:47:59 but they're just so funny
02:48:01 I watched some of the show
02:48:03 and it was okay
02:48:05 it doesn't even need the animation
02:48:07 somehow it works perfectly
02:48:09 when it's just comic panels in sequence
02:48:11 somehow it just works perfectly with that style
02:48:13 bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
02:48:15 bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
02:48:17 oh my god
02:48:19 it's so weird
02:48:21 it's like baby cakes and the Professor Bros.
02:48:23 are just such memorable amazing characters
02:48:25 I don't know
02:48:27 they don't really come across
02:48:29 they don't really come across that
02:48:31 they still have their personality in the show
02:48:33 but I don't think they come across as well
02:48:35 it's just fundamentally
02:48:37 is different and feels different on
02:48:39 aspect of it being an actual show
02:48:41 And I'm not even like mad or anything, but just like a part of me. I can't help but prefer the original YouTube videos
02:48:47 Yeah, I don't know. It was a
02:48:50 Just just it's like Carson's
02:48:53 Carsonization like every every evolutionary line eventually
02:48:56 Takes on a crab-like form because it's just the most effective shape and similarly every
02:49:03 Eventually finds itself working on an adult animated cartoon about being a dad or whatever
02:49:08 So we desperately need more family animated shows obviously so funny like Simpsons and Family Guy are both still airing new episodes
02:49:16 Yeah, they are
02:49:18 They never stopped
02:49:21 Uh, okay next
02:49:24 Uh, was that the one we just listened to? Yeah, Mordecai. That's right. Um, next one is called
02:49:31 Oh, the next one is an image. So here's here's the image. I haven't looked at it
02:49:35 Oh, there it is
02:49:39 I hate the anti-christ
02:49:41 We've got you surrounded
02:49:44 That's it's the name of the Nerf gun
02:49:46 It's this name that I still don't really get it's the Nerf gun from the the the fucking ragcon three
02:49:52 arena ragcon three good attention
02:49:55 That's a nice deep cut. Azumi has one has one arm. So big crimp. Yeah, but that's okay
02:50:01 Oh
02:50:02 This is before the accident. She lost the irs. Oh, fuck back story confirmed. It was the irs
02:50:09 Right the irs chopped her arm off
02:50:13 Well, nobody like they'll do that in real life if you get behind on your payments
02:50:16 They will come cut your arm off like a samurai. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's true
02:50:20 Is the anti-christ in the rebel pixels like grain red
02:50:24 You know, well, I see it's got the irs highlighted. Oh, yeah, I noticed that I didn't realize but yeah
02:50:30 Yeah, you're right. That is like the that color schema
02:50:35 I don't know like
02:50:37 Yes, I guess I agree. I will say I guess I agree with this image. Tom is insane. I've definitely made
02:50:43 The repo time in my life just just today honestly
02:50:48 So that's pretty true
02:50:52 Relatable base to make a to be fair. I'm not a ton of debt. I'm just in student debt, but who is
02:50:58 Mmm smart people many you didn't get your student debt canceled. No
02:51:04 Biden Biden
02:51:11 Well rich people are in debt all the time rich people take on more debt
02:51:15 You can't make money without being in a shitload of debt
02:51:18 That's what sam sam hide told me that actually max out all your credit cards
02:51:23 Rich people just borrow just they just keep borrowing more and more money and never pay it back and like whatever
02:51:29 What are they gonna do?
02:51:30 The gold knife is just to make as much debt as you possibly can rack up as much debt as you can and then die and leave it all
02:51:35 to your kids
02:51:36 Wasn't there like a greek philosopher or someone who was constantly like in debt to everyone?
02:51:41 But he was like, yeah, it's great because when when you owe other people money
02:51:44 They're always trying to like hook you up with like connections that like will make you money
02:51:49 Making money and like they don't want to see you debt
02:51:51 They have a vested interest in you sticking around because yeah, you get in debt to everyone
02:51:56 And they're all like they're all like pulling for you and like like like on your team now because they need you to succeed
02:52:03 Well, I certainly certainly seems to work for the us because I think the us isn't like
02:52:08 27 trillion dollars insane amount of debt. That's like good though
02:52:12 National debt is like good for some reason right that's what they can't just nuke us because they have to collect
02:52:18 They're dead first
02:52:20 Yeah, they'll just repossess our country when we can't pay it
02:52:24 Oh, that's fine. I'll be dead by then the zoomers can deal with that
02:52:29 I'm already adopting the boomer mindset of just all okay. It's fine. I'm just ruin everything and die
02:52:33 They make so much more sense now that I'm getting older
02:52:36 Why solve the problems we create? Uh, it's too late to fix things might as well just not do anything
02:52:42 Yeah, just pass everything on to the next generation
02:52:46 The next voicemail is called
02:52:51 Um, it is called a worst idea ever. She they
02:52:56 three two one go
02:52:58 So when discussing how older games have soul while newer games often don't Nate said this on his gamer zone podcast
02:53:05 People argue about that word soul so often one day. I want to make a video defining
02:53:10 And it really struck me this is the quintessential example of something that is both the worst idea
02:53:14 He's ever had and also the most best guy ever idea
02:53:17 He's ever had and I finally fully grasp how those two things are directly correlated with each other
02:53:23 I see okay
02:53:25 You know, I I listened to that a gamer zone podcast and uh, I I left a comment
02:53:31 I really thought that everyone involved with that project was should just be ashamed of themselves
02:53:37 I uh, I feel like it's the new hot thing. I feel like the pcp
02:53:40 That's gonna be on the way out and everybody should drop and start pledging to the gamer zone podcast
02:53:45 Which doesn't or doesn't even exist doesn't even have a patreon. Um, what can I say? I never say no to a podcast appearance
02:53:50 I'm here now aren't I?
02:53:53 The standards are the bottom bottom floor
02:53:57 I uh, I don't worry. I'll I'll sneak in plenty of um, I'll be sneaking in plenty of pcp references that and like
02:54:03 I'll be mind fucking Nate's audience tricking them. It's coming back
02:54:08 Nate uh, like oh my god, I've never heard like have you
02:54:12 The Nate Nate fans will be blindsided to know that he was once on a podcast. What Nate podcast what?
02:54:19 um, um
02:54:21 So I don't know if this is the person I'm thinking of but I saw someone in the comments of the gamer zone making a comment about
02:54:29 Soul and being irritated that like Nate describes things as having soul
02:54:34 And being like that's so vague and it's literally just something you can say you like anything you like you can just say it has soul
02:54:40 Yeah, that's right. Everything I like is good wherever you want it and everything that's bad and new is soulless
02:54:45 That's just the way the world works and I like yeah
02:54:47 I guess yeah, it is. Um, I mean
02:54:49 I mean it's sort of an extension of just saying like if if it's good if if I like it then it's good
02:54:56 And if I don't like it basically yes, but like describing the words to that
02:54:59 To imply that there's more is that Nate could just make make a 50 minute video
02:55:03 That's just like like this is what it means to have a soul and first of all
02:55:07 Let's take a look at the first game to involve souls undertale. It's like a look here
02:55:12 They invented it
02:55:15 My take on soulfulness really quick is like I feel soul what it means is like you can tell the people working on the game
02:55:21 Like liked it and they tried they were trying to make a good game
02:55:23 They weren't just trying to make a quick book again. I know that's not something you can just quantify but like there's it's some
02:55:30 slight difference between
02:55:32 soul versus like me likey thing
02:55:34 It basically isn't there basically is no difference between that but like I think it's sort of it's like
02:55:39 Knowing that people are getting a sense at least that people cared about the product
02:55:43 They were making is a feeling that affects your opinion of the game in some way that is that the game itself
02:55:51 Doesn't really have anything to do with it's just sort of like right
02:55:54 You just feel happier thinking about the fact that people put their heart and soul
02:55:59 Into a product. I always thought it was less corporate therefore you like it more for no real reason
02:56:04 But I just thought a soul basically means personality when something has a lot of
02:56:09 Personality to it. I think it it definitely doesn't have like one set meaning
02:56:13 So this is sort of just what our takes on it are and I feel like both of those takes are pretty accurate in terms of just
02:56:17 As opposed to something that is a homogenized
02:56:20 Because like for example, you can you can look at the new super mario bros games that everybody hates
02:56:26 And uh, you can say those games kind of lack personality and therefore soul
02:56:31 But then you look at mario world and mario bros 3 and 2
02:56:36 And those games have a lot more personality
02:56:39 See the thing is it's not a very useful term to use and I I don't use it myself
02:56:44 When somebody does use it, I know what they're getting at
02:56:47 Generally speaking, it's a little bit of a fortune. It's kind of unquantifiable because it really does what uses it
02:56:53 It relies a lot on
02:56:55 Your perception and if you have nostalgia or not that
02:56:59 Influences whether you think there's soul in a product, right two examples of uh games
02:57:04 I think are soulful it's like sonic adventure is a soulful game
02:57:07 That's not necessarily always good, but it like it feels like they had fun making it and they were trying really hard
02:57:13 And they were like trying to make a good game. That's why it's like crammed full of ideas even if they don't all work
02:57:18 I feel like another example of a soulful game is earthbound because it was made by an auteur and it wasn't like
02:57:22 Yeah, I was gonna say trying to be
02:57:25 Earthbound is quirky and stuff, but it's not like trying to be a quirky in the rpg
02:57:28 It was just trying to be like itoy just made this game based off of like his life experiences and stuff
02:57:32 You know what I mean? Like it's I don't know it's hard to explain
02:57:35 It really is hard to explain and it's not something you can easily quantify and a lot of it just does come down
02:57:39 How do you personally feel about a game?
02:57:41 It's like if you if you look at uh a typical ubisoft like open world
02:57:49 Kind of shooting game you can kind of tell that that doesn't have much salt to it
02:57:53 It's almost easier to point to the soullessness than soulfulness. Yeah, it's just a pure corporate production
02:57:59 People just have to make it and they have to make a million of them
02:58:03 Okay, but I think it's possible for a corporate entity to make a game
02:58:09 Yeah feels like it does have soul
02:58:11 You're absolutely right like a shitload of art throughout human history has been commissioned, you know by like, you know
02:58:17 Not not not just corporations, but like, you know wealthy, you know patrons of the arts and like the
02:58:22 You know the renaissance and stuff like a lot of art
02:58:24 I wish art could just exist spontaneously
02:58:27 You know without having to be you know fit within the monetary framework of reality
02:58:31 But you know
02:58:32 It doesn't so yeah a lot of good art can come from a corporate shit too
02:58:35 But like there is still element of soullessness and homogeneity that you can see and identify
02:58:39 Well, a corporation has to hire artists and artists might care about the work they're doing
02:58:45 right
02:58:46 Yeah, it's really kind of a useless metric by wish to judge a game
02:58:51 um
02:58:52 Like it whether or not it's like you think it's has soul or it doesn't
02:58:57 The game is the same and if it's made corporately
02:59:01 Uh or like artistically the end product is the only thing you're experiencing
02:59:05 You don't really know and that can't possibly influence
02:59:10 Anything right like you know
02:59:13 It's just the the end product is the thing that you end up experiencing and the the soul is just added on on top of your own
02:59:19 Yeah, it's what you're extrapolating backwards based on what you think happened during game development
02:59:23 Which is again like you will have a different opinion of how soulful a game is if you were there for the entire process of making it
02:59:29 Which obviously, you know, you can't be for that's true
02:59:31 When you when you say it has soul you're saying that it feels as though someone put a lot of work and love into it
02:59:37 And maybe they did or maybe they didn't but like you don't you don't know at the end of the day
02:59:41 You're you're just saying it feels like they did and that's good at the end of the day
02:59:45 It is a nebulous term. It doesn't really have much
02:59:48 Or not narrative doesn't have much like analytical value because it's so unquantifiable
02:59:54 It's better to like if you feel like something has soul, it's better to kind of extrapolate
02:59:59 What about it is resonating with you that way emotionally you can you can be like I feel like it has soul
03:00:04 But you got to explain like what okay, what what about it makes you say
03:00:09 If it resonates with you and an emotional level like that and you're trying to make an analytical point or trying to like
03:00:15 Explain what that means you have to then extrapolate into something much more concrete
03:00:21 So someone else can understand why what you're coming from just defining soul
03:00:25 Will not solve the problem. You're defining your feelings. You could just double down on on the feeling aspect and just say
03:00:32 There's just something unquantifiable about this that I just really love and I don't
03:00:37 I don't think Nate would accept that if someone else. Yeah, that's that's what I was just saying either way like you can't
03:00:42 Either way it all comes down to the specific thing what like it was a specific game
03:00:45 I think it's all four or not it's hard to do this is in the abstract make a video
03:00:48 That's just about soul. You know what I mean like that would be really
03:00:52 I like to list specific examples like
03:00:55 In earthbound there's an enemy called mad duck and one of his attacks
03:01:01 I forget what it does, but one of his attacks is to spin something around
03:01:05 Which like confuses you or whatever and it doesn't tell you what he spins around
03:01:09 He just spins something around, you know the dialogue says that
03:01:13 So it's little things like that that are sprinkled throughout the game that I think
03:01:18 Adds personality and you could say it's uh, it's soul
03:01:23 I can I can imagine though a game where like the developer really cared about what they were making
03:01:29 And they really put a lot of themselves into it and they worked really hard and they poured love and time and energy into making
03:01:34 Exactly the product that they wanted to make
03:01:37 But like it's bad and it's something that you hate and you don't like it. Yeah
03:01:42 What what it's still
03:01:44 That can certainly happen
03:01:46 What it's was it is it still I guess that you'd still yeah, it's it's soulful, but it's not good
03:01:50 I I guess that would make I guess that can exist. It's gonna be pretty rare
03:01:54 You'd see people say shit like that, but I mean like I guess you're right
03:01:57 Actually, I think a good example of that is uh, what was that game called a deadly premonition? I think
03:02:03 Well, most of the time when you're saying, oh, it's soulful and you say why and then you oh, well, you know
03:02:08 Here's some here's a detail that I like here's a story
03:02:11 That's a that's a game that uh is kind of bad, but a lot of people loved it. Yeah, it's like a
03:02:17 game
03:02:18 It's people love it in spite of the fact that it's kind of a hotness
03:02:22 Hmm
03:02:24 Yeah, but that's because uh, it was clear the the developer put a lot of love into it even though it's kind of bad
03:02:32 I'm thinking of uh, I'm thinking of limbo of the lost
03:02:36 as a soul a soulful
03:02:38 Game with a lot of a personality that's just piece of shit
03:02:41 Game, yeah, you know, you know that one right the uh the one with uh
03:02:46 The one that's the box art, right?
03:02:49 The I don't know the box. It's the one that ends with the the king limbo song
03:02:55 Uh, oh, yeah, it's not the box. I'm thinking of it's uh, but yeah, um mandalore gaming had a good video on this
03:03:00 Which is how yeah, yeah, it's a good bad game. This is again. I had like lots of blood ledgerism and didn't it
03:03:05 Yeah
03:03:07 Stuff just in it. They just stole assets from skyrim
03:03:11 Uh, nothing nothing says soul more than stealing assets
03:03:17 Well, okay, they stole a lot of stuff
03:03:19 But the stuff that they did is original is very weird and very like unique. Um, I mean an a tour made this
03:03:26 I don't agree with some of the vision assets
03:03:29 But like that doesn't necessarily preclude something from being soulful like barkley shut up in jam
03:03:34 Guiding it has a lot of stolen assets, but like that's part of the joke like that's intentional. It's not like they're it was
03:03:39 That's uh, that's almost like a a rom hack from back in the days when people used to do rom hacks and
03:03:46 that kind of thing
03:03:48 Something useful about rom hacks in general just the way that it's like such a purely fan driven out of love
03:03:54 Not for a problem. A rom hack is uh, when you think about it, it's kind of like a fanfic
03:04:00 Just uh from a
03:04:02 Programming standpoint, right?
03:04:03 Basically every good programmer got their start like modding some other game, you know what I mean?
03:04:07 Well, not like every good programmer, but you know a lot of
03:04:10 I think that's uh, that's a case for a christian whitehead who made sonic mania
03:04:16 Yeah, a lot of the modern sonic mania team in particular is basically made up of fans from the rom hacking scene, which is pretty cool
03:04:23 Um
03:04:24 I think I think we can go to the next voicemail. Oh, yeah, I forgot that that was all just soul
03:04:30 So we basically made Nate's video for him. We just talked about it for 15 minutes about yeah
03:04:34 But he can't if he just clips our audio and makes that video. He's got to pay for it
03:04:41 Wouldn't be a very soulful explanation
03:04:44 This clip so it else's podcast here's my video
03:04:47 Then the next voicemail is called, uh, it's called nothing can stop me. No, there is nothing that can stop me now
03:04:55 Uh, sorry, it's it's loading
03:04:57 There it is. Okay, three two one go
03:05:02 None of you can stop my evil machinations from coming at your fruition. None of you can stop my
03:05:09 history plans
03:05:12 And underneath the table of justice. I reside
03:05:16 sticking
03:05:17 sticky six of gum
03:05:20 under the table and which I
03:05:23 I reside which I will reign supreme
03:05:28 Sir, you may lift the table up
03:05:30 But I will win as soon as the table turns you have flipped the tables yourself leaving me
03:05:38 That victor sure you can punch me in the face
03:05:42 But I have a face mask that can block exactly one punch
03:05:48 He thought of everything
03:05:51 What can you do? Why can't you say there is nothing that can't stop me now?
03:05:58 I like imagining that he recorded that under the table
03:06:02 Where he was sticking during class the tables sure have turned
03:06:09 Well, I'm intimidated sounds like he won and I feel like there's nothing we can do about it other than admit defeat a big
03:06:15 w for that guy who
03:06:18 Uh, I don't know. I don't remember being under the table guy under the table guy is uh, he's he's thought of everything

03:07:08 Uh, who was the guest? I don't even remember a single last week was crack
03:07:14 Yes, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was last week. He had exactly two guests. Uh, crack and tom

03:07:29 Uh, next voicemail is called, uh, it is called order number us one underscore zero seven eight four six
03:07:39 four one
03:07:41 Hold on. Let me put it in the dang chat. Okay, there it is three two one go
03:07:50 Hello, how are you today? I am chewing gum in your ear. What? No, I am a real person
03:08:00 Can we continue? This is the asmr you ordered
03:08:05 I am a real person. Did you hear me okay?
03:08:09 This is a bar package was ordered by Nate on october 19th 2017
03:08:17 Yes, I'm a real person
03:08:19 There is a live person here. We're sorry for the delayed shipping. Who's the real person? I am a real person. Oh
03:08:26 I am a real person
03:08:29 God
03:08:30 Is that it?
03:08:32 Okay, that was good fine. Well, that was great whatever that was
03:08:36 We did they were a real person. They obviously
03:08:40 I mean that was never in question. That's what real people do is insist how real they are over and over again
03:08:45 I I am a real person
03:08:47 You see this is what is known as performance art
03:08:50 Your question about whether I'm real has already been answered by my statements
03:08:56 About that. I am real, uh, actually
03:08:59 Uh, next one is called one upping. Sorry. It's bad. Uh, she her
03:09:05 Here did I already put it in the yeah, there it is. Okay, three two one go
03:09:12 All right, so a little bit towards the end of the episode of last week
03:09:16 You guys were all, you know, kind of just going a little bit crazy over the fact that somebody had been watching
03:09:22 Um watching your pony videos since they were 11
03:09:25 And you know, I I thought that was a bit weird. Um, because I've been watching your videos
03:09:32 Since I was 11. Um, I got into the pcp
03:09:35 Like at the tail end of fifth grade
03:09:39 Um, I was
03:09:41 Looking for something to listen to while I got um got my work done. Um, it started ironically with, um
03:09:48 Monkey jones and the biggest problem in the universe and I'm no not the biggest problem in the universe. Whatever they're, uh
03:09:54 In sufferable social insufferable social media or whatever and off of that since they kept referencing the pcp
03:10:00 I ended up getting into it. So, um, I am currently 14 years of age
03:10:06 So I you know, I I just wanted to let you guys know
03:10:10 That that there are active young people in your audience currently and I'm sure that I'm not the only one
03:10:16 I can't terrify your band. Yeah. Yeah, this fair is banned. I'm sorry
03:10:20 We mark every episode as not suitable for children
03:10:23 Get the it fuck out of here
03:10:26 It kind of it kind of doesn't surprise me that much really that there would have been like kids like young kids that found
03:10:33 Us through the pony stuff because that's kid shit
03:10:36 It it's a little more surprising that like a kid would still find us in like a post pony era because like what's the
03:10:42 Through like monkey jones. I guess if you like monkey, are you an edgy 14 year old? Who is it?
03:10:50 Uh, if you're an edgy 14 year old you find us through monkey if you are a
03:10:54 Korean 14 year old you find us through
03:10:57 Uh, uh, all the rest of us through normal means everyone else. Yeah. Yeah. I'll you find us on reddit
03:11:02 Insufferable social media podcast is the gateway drug to pcp
03:11:08 It is it probably was I don't even remember them saying the pcp that much
03:11:12 I thought I felt felt like a very self-contained old show. I never actually never actually listened to it
03:11:17 So I I actually quite enjoyed it. It was probably my favorite thing. Mumki did
03:11:22 I remember the gimmick was that they were both saying outrageous shit
03:11:25 Like that was so obviously like, you know, just clearly like in character
03:11:30 You know what? I mean like the whole time like they're just trying to one up each other who could say the most ridiculous thing
03:11:34 Which I think is a pretty interesting premise. Also. It was like short for a podcast. It wasn't a long
03:11:38 It was like 20 minutes to 30 minutes
03:11:41 But that's uh, that's a good bit for back then but probably not. Oh, yeah nowadays. Um, yeah
03:11:46 It was some edgy shit edgy humor in general attracts 14 year olds
03:11:49 I'm not that surprised. It would get an audience of that. But um, yeah
03:11:53 Yeah, yeah, I don't know if you're a new pcp fan listening to this explain how and why and
03:11:59 Yeah, I guess I'm kind of curious the ultimate question tell we want to hear your pcp stories
03:12:05 We want to hear
03:12:07 From the audience like what the fuck are you doing and why and why are you still here?
03:12:11 I do I do find that kind of thing really interesting. Uh, whenever somebody
03:12:15 Mentioned that they are a fan of mine or whatever. I'm always interested or how did you find me?
03:12:21 Yeah, it is interesting. I've been running in hiding for so long
03:12:26 There's probably at least one person out there who found me through the pcp, which is funny
03:12:30 Yeah, actually, I got uh, I got two comments, uh
03:12:34 On my stuff saying they found you through the pcp. That's uh, that's kind of weird
03:12:40 That is weird
03:12:42 Why would they go to your channel? Thanks for letting me know, I guess
03:12:45 I don't know why they posted comments on on on comments. I left
03:12:49 Uh, and they were like, uh, hey, I know you from the pcp and I I found out about cybershell from the pcp too
03:12:56 There's a huge contingent of quadruple pcp fans. You guys are like just oh, let's just do another episode
03:13:01 Whatever, we'll there's like a millions of people out there. They're the silent majority. They're the silent majority just clamoring
03:13:08 Uh, uh, silently, of course
03:13:10 I would love if it was like like some foreign country like japan or a weirder one like iran
03:13:15 Like you have a huge fan base over there, but they never can interact with you
03:13:20 We're uh, afghanistan
03:13:22 There are a pretty sizable number of like, uh, south american
03:13:26 Listeners, I feel I feel like that's I feel like those that continent is fairly well represented among the really big
03:13:35 There's a lot of youtube and and social media stuff in like brazil and things
03:13:39 I see lots of like come to brazil comments. I think it's like a meme like they just yeah
03:13:43 We'll leave a big population. It makes sense that there's like a lot of people there, but you're big in south america
03:13:47 I know at least four or five people from south america actually
03:13:52 Um, not even in the same country just different countries. Yeah different countries, but all from those
03:13:59 Sorts, how can I tell youtube? I only want americans watching my content. Nobody else. No other countries should be allowed to access it
03:14:06 You can block
03:14:08 Maybe we should build a wall in youtube
03:14:11 We should build a fire
03:14:13 That you have to like play brick breaker to get through if you're from a different country. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
03:14:19 Yeah, it shouldn't be impossible to get over the wall just like a slight inconvenience
03:14:24 Just just to let you know that we really don't want you got to do a mario
03:14:28 Jump like triple jump over the wall. You got to do a triple wall. You have to backwards long jump through the videos to get
03:14:34 Yeah, yeah, you got a blj like like speed clip
03:14:37 You gotta you you have to yeah, you have to um you have to build up speed for 12 hours to clip into a qpu
03:14:44 In order to get over to get through the wall
03:14:46 actually
03:14:48 And if you hit a if you press a at all you're uh your bands, you know if that's how vpns worked
03:14:53 I would actually play one
03:14:55 If it was mario 64
03:14:58 You know if a vpn was mario 64 i might also play
03:15:04 Just like too confusing so they just have to build video games like into them so people can like get excited about them
03:15:09 You jump into a painting. It's like a video
03:15:12 You jump into the youtube painting like yeah, it's like it organizes the internet as the castle from mario 64
03:15:18 Opening up microsoft word. I'm like typing is boring. I wish I could type by playing mario 64
03:15:24 Like like yeah, I'm pounding the the keyboard. They did make a they did make a mario's typing game for the pc whatever it was called
03:15:33 Um, yeah, tom even fucking around with linux like how would you feel about if instead of the current graphic user interface?
03:15:37 They just replaced everything with mario 64. Would that be an improvement? It'd be better than linux. That's for sure
03:15:46 Hot take um next voicemail, I guess uh is called
03:15:52 Uh, oh wait, I didn't fucking I didn't put it in the chat. Sorry. Here it is. It's called. No, it's called one upping
03:15:59 It's bad she heard did I just play this one?
03:16:03 Or are you that's a title?
03:16:05 Oh, i'm stupid. No, no, no that sorry. Okay. Let's play the one that's number 35 40 at the end
03:16:11 It's called some dumb shit one. Okay, three two one go
03:16:17 Okay, so I got some dumb shit to say nice. Um
03:16:20 I was reading this thing on the pcp
03:16:23 subreddit, I think
03:16:25 And it mentions a couple things about gib
03:16:28 And it also mentions gib's real dead name. Maybe I don't know if you've changed your name yet gib, but
03:16:36 Apparently gib are you actually like a professionally trained guitarist? I thought you did some kind of like
03:16:44 Writing job
03:16:46 I'm not a professional. I mean I had it said something about you being a professional guitarist
03:16:50 and how is gib a musician
03:16:54 And somehow trixie is the one who thinks she's
03:16:57 A musician when she's the worst
03:17:02 Okay, well first first off
03:17:04 I have not changed my name
03:17:06 Um because I have no issues with it. So I don't mind
03:17:09 Uh, so my name's the same. Um
03:17:12 I'm not professionally trained. I don't know I I I've played guitar at a few gigs before
03:17:20 Um, and they weren't for money. They were just sort of like like at various events
03:17:24 And I was like, hey, do you want to play guitar the thing? I'm like, yeah, all right
03:17:28 I've played with my my dad and his band a couple times
03:17:32 But I'm not like a professional musician by any metric
03:17:35 Uh, and I do like hobbyist stuff. I have a band camp with some
03:17:39 Some good stuff and some shit stuff. I should get rid of some of the shit stuff
03:17:47 I haven't posted any music in a while
03:17:49 I haven't it's it's mostly just sort of a like I have a guitar and occasionally I just
03:17:54 Pick it up and play for like a few hours and then it's fun. It's like it is like a hobbyist sort of thing
03:18:00 I don't really intend to make music because making music involves like
03:18:04 Putting multiple instruments together or thinking of lyrics
03:18:08 And I just don't have the patience for that like recording and and like mastering anything. I'm just like fuck it
03:18:15 I don't care. I enjoy playing the guitar. I don't enjoy recording their guitar
03:18:20 Also, uh, I would need like a manager for all that
03:18:25 Also Trixie isn't a musician. She's a rapper. There is a difference
03:18:32 No, I mean
03:18:34 It's a subcategory. I guess she doesn't play an instrument. I think you have to be a
03:18:39 To play an instrument. I guess your voice your voice is an instrument
03:18:43 I think the the the term people use as artists rather than musician just like you create
03:18:50 You create some music, but you don't literally create the music you you rap over beats that other people make
03:18:57 Artists works just as a catch-all. Yeah
03:19:00 sure
03:19:02 Not only should you not be allowed to rap over other people's beats
03:19:05 You shouldn't even be allowed to play an instrument unless you built it yourself. That's the only you shouldn't even be allowed to rap
03:19:10 I built a guitar once
03:19:13 You're allowed to play it then
03:19:16 Yeah, you you you you're safe
03:19:18 You're safe for now
03:19:21 Okay, the next one is called dumb shit, uh, two. It's the next one. Okay three two one go
03:19:29 Uh, so
03:19:32 Tom's discussion about laptop hardware shit
03:19:37 Might be the hardest I have ever zoned out
03:19:41 Of any person speaking
03:19:43 About any subject I'll be honest that was I kind of zoned out as well the yellow light discussion
03:19:50 Um, I don't okay. It wasn't like you got that deep in the technical stuff
03:19:54 You basically had one point which is that you know modular laptops where you can take shit out is good
03:20:00 Instead of have anything be soldered to like the motherboard and shit, which is a perfectly fine take. Yeah, I think that's fine
03:20:06 It wasn't something I had a lot of
03:20:08 The yellow light thing literally took hours and derailed the entire
03:20:13 Yellow light thing was funny. Wait wait. What the yellow light thing took hours and derailed the episode
03:20:19 It came up multiple times
03:20:23 Throughout the episode there was a cutaway. I remember where Trixie had like a whole like live action vlog thing for a little bit talking about
03:20:29 It was a whole
03:20:31 Wait, what are you talking about?
03:20:33 We're talking about the like like five years ago the yellow light episode of the pcp
03:20:38 Where jesse had a meltdown because you guys accuse his videos of having warm light instead of cold light
03:20:45 I thought oh, you're comparing. Oh, you're come. I thought you were saying that this happened last episode
03:20:51 He was saying it was the worst thing since the yellow light
03:20:54 Uh, oh
03:20:56 Oh, I get it. I get it. I guess the yellow light thing was good though. I don't know why yeah, that was a great meme everybody
03:21:01 Love that except you this day. Literally the most memorable thing that ever happened on the pcp
03:21:06 He was still bringing it up like five years later. He just brought it up right now
03:21:13 The best thing that ever happened on the pcp is also the worst thing that ever happened
03:21:18 Uh, that sounds about right. It's the second worst thing talking about the framework laptop. Was it the worst?
03:21:24 Five years from now people are gonna be like this was worse than that time
03:21:27 Tom had to got dastic to talk about laptop talk about a modular laptop
03:21:31 See, this is this is why this product is necessary because all you fucking smooth brains out there are fine with throwing away your laptop every two years
03:21:38 Fucking yeah, laptops have never appealed to me basically because of that. You know, they're like such like a specific thing
03:21:43 Like I mean they have their uses. I mean nothing against it
03:21:46 But like I just like a computer because it's like a real thing you can upgrade and stuff
03:21:51 I'm a bit of a computer tech guy myself
03:21:54 So I really would appreciate if all laptops were designed in a modular manner. Do you want to talk about it for like 20 minutes?
03:22:00 Yeah, let's get into it. Let's just just piss this guy off because I mean come on
03:22:04 Why would you not want that? I mean at least if he didn't like the conversation
03:22:07 He at least should admit that you were right
03:22:09 But I just want to say I watched a youtube video about it recently by uh, what's that guy's name?
03:22:14 Linus. Yeah, Linus tech tips. Yeah, we mentioned it last week. It's really good
03:22:20 I watched the entire video was pretty interesting great idea
03:22:22 Unfortunately, I don't think it's gonna catch on. That's the pessimistic side of myself. Yeah
03:22:27 I just I just want them to exist as like a niche
03:22:31 enthusiast brand for for smart people
03:22:34 Like just even existing is like what we have to take at this point
03:22:38 Not that it's the industry standard that like it exists at all in any capacity is what we're taking as a w
03:22:44 That's that's that's capitalism for you. Yeah, that's that's that's basically where we at
03:22:49 Take what I can get I'll take what I can get
03:22:53 Uh next voicemail is called. I think it's on dumb shit number three
03:22:58 Yes, dumb shit three three two one go
03:23:01 This one time I tried to mess with chris chan
03:23:05 This was in like 08 or 09
03:23:09 And this girl I was hanging out with I got her really into chris chan stuff
03:23:14 And she wanted to send chris a picture of her boobs
03:23:17 But chris said no, thank you
03:23:19 So really
03:23:22 My point is a story
03:23:25 Fuck people who think that everyone who
03:23:28 Goes to the kiwi farms to think about chris
03:23:32 Wants chris to kill themselves like
03:23:36 Some of us just want chris to just not be a shithead
03:23:40 That's kind of where I've always been
03:23:43 Um, I saw some people getting upset at crack for saying like
03:23:47 Destroy kiwi farms at four chan
03:23:49 But like the point is like yes
03:23:50 No one thinks every single human being on kiwi farms is like a psycho a log wants chris to die
03:23:57 But like the fact is if you post there you're posting alongside people like that and the whole point of the site is that
03:24:03 They will not face repercussions for being like that. I I completely understand
03:24:08 Why you would be interested in the sorts of things they talk about on kiwi farms for like non malicious reasons
03:24:14 It's a gossip brag, right? I mean it's the human nature people love to gossip about shit
03:24:19 But I doesn't mean I think it's like a good place
03:24:22 The the thing that bothered me most about it is what you brought up a while ago
03:24:25 Ben saying which is that they loved a posture like oh, we're not transphobic
03:24:29 We just allow any kind of free speech
03:24:31 But if you go in and use the proper pronouns people have a bigger meltdown and they get upset
03:24:36 It's they get upset being not transphobic is like
03:24:39 Theoretically allowed, but you will you will start a fight?
03:24:42 You will start a fight if you do it just without even trying like you know what I mean?
03:24:46 It's like so I don't know so to it's a little disingenuous
03:24:49 Also, it's not an anti trans site because there's nothing in the rules that says you have to be anti trans or whatever
03:24:54 So I don't know paper. It's not on paper. They have no ideology of any kind
03:24:58 They're completely free of all of all bias or political
03:25:02 The idea is whatsoever
03:25:04 But you mean of course
03:25:07 The most the most political
03:25:09 The most ideological people are the ones that claim that they have no
03:25:12 Ideology it's a kind of a bad place, but it's a little bit too useful if you want to find out information about people
03:25:20 Yeah
03:25:21 I mean, that's why I sometimes look at it
03:25:24 So I'm like if I I mean if I want to know what like what is the gossip about someone's like
03:25:29 Yeah, if you want to find out all the terrible things ben saint has done or has ever said in his life
03:25:34 That's a place to go
03:25:37 Uh
03:25:38 No, you just go to my youtube channel. You just go to my twitter feed for that
03:25:42 See them
03:25:42 Yeah, you need to cut them out of the equation and do all your embarrassing shit publicly loudly on your twitter
03:25:47 So it's like nobody even needs to like go find a thread on you. You can just be an asshole in public
03:25:52 Well, that was that was that was chris chan's strategy is it's like, you know four cent garbage is posting all these lies about me
03:25:59 So I will flood out the lies with with with the honest truth
03:26:03 I think I'm pretty sure that worked. I think it works perfectly
03:26:07 Well, it it's sort of work. I mean it didn't have exactly the consequences
03:26:11 I think I think though. I think everything had a happy ending in the whole chris chan story. I haven't looked into it recently
03:26:16 I don't know about that
03:26:18 Yeah, I haven't looked at it in a while, but last I checked everything was just pretty much fine
03:26:25 Next voicemail is called let me put it here in the chat it is called um
03:26:31 The I it's called I I meant parasailing
03:26:35 three two one go
03:26:40 Hang gliding is scary
03:26:44 Yeah, sarah palin more like parasailing
03:26:50 That one got me
03:26:52 um
03:26:54 Hang
03:26:56 What's the difference uh
03:26:59 Hang gliding is all glide on the air parasailing is where you sail on the ocean
03:27:04 Parasailing seems less dangerous because if you fell you would just fall into the water
03:27:09 Yeah, Paris seems less scary than hang-hiding. Hang-hiding is like you jump off a cliff. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah
03:27:16 If you played uh sonic 2 3 game gear you would uh, oh, yeah
03:27:20 This little hang glider item. There's most of my hang gliding and knowledge comes from pilo wings from that game
03:27:25 Hang gliding is just like elytra in minecraft if you get some fireworks and you set them off you can keep going
03:27:32 I I don't think I don't think I'm interested in doing any like
03:27:37 Any like extreme
03:27:39 I mean, that's not even that extreme. I mean like skydiving type stuff
03:27:42 I don't think I'm interested in doing any of that shit ever again because I'm I'm very very aware of like the
03:27:48 Frailness of my human body and just how easily you're not interested in paranoid about it
03:27:54 You're not interested in uh potentially putting your life at risk and dying
03:27:58 I would really know
03:28:01 Because I could see Ben saying jumping out of a suicidal. Oh, yeah, I was gonna say if you have nothing to live for
03:28:06 I was like I was like maybe when I'm older all I go skydiving and I don't care if I'm fucking live
03:28:10 I have the most to live for living in some fucking base living is so fucking awesome
03:28:14 I could see Ben saying like jumping out of a yes. Yes. That's exactly right. Give that's why I'm fucking miserable and terrified
03:28:22 I'm miserable and terrified of the idea that this great life that I'm living being scared all the time will come to an end
03:28:28 unironically true
03:28:30 I'm so sad that eventually this life where I spend every day every waking moment
03:28:34 Just thinking about what it would be like if my head got squished under a train. I don't want that to end
03:28:39 I don't want that to go on. Yeah, please more of this, please
03:28:42 You're excited about the potential for life, but you know what a great, uh
03:28:47 Other of the reality
03:28:49 You know what a great, uh philosopher once said life is a cage and death is a key
03:28:55 I heard that I heard that once. Oh, I wonder who said that one
03:29:01 It was it was give give said that that one time
03:29:05 I know you didn't have to spill it out
03:29:08 It was you actually that should be on a fucking shirt
03:29:11 You said that thing that time that should be on a shirt. Was that on the yellow episode?
03:29:17 No, that was way later than that
03:29:19 No, I don't I don't I don't actually know when it was but I
03:29:25 I remember mage being there. Would you be allowed to put that on a shirt now?
03:29:31 Uh
03:29:32 There is
03:29:33 Well, somebody should somebody should put it on a fucking shirt
03:29:36 Uh next if you sell a shirt you have to mail us money
03:29:40 Viewers, uh, don't you won't get away with it. Uh, next one is a next voicemail is an image
03:29:46 thankfully
03:29:49 Uh, okay, I this is a comparison from the last I guess we were not sure who it was
03:29:56 I mean, I thought it was munchy, but I think we did settle that it was munchy
03:30:02 Well was Ben behind I kind of remember the original image. They didn't so we thought it looked like doesn't matter
03:30:07 But we weren't sure if it was super much. They're bad, but I think this image thoroughly says
03:30:12 Like I guess it's I guess it was munchy
03:30:15 Whoops
03:30:18 Okay, well, uh next one is called
03:30:23 Put it in the chat right there three five four five. It is called a suggestion
03:30:28 three two one go
03:30:31 Hello there PCP
03:30:35 I was wondering why you still have Nate as a member of the pro crastonators podcast
03:30:43 He does not do anything
03:30:46 You cannot extract surplus value from him. He is dead
03:30:52 literally
03:30:54 Release him into the great beyond and also it would make some people very angry
03:31:05 Well
03:31:06 I don't I don't know why I decided to eat this left over wait. What do they want to say?
03:31:11 Kill me start eating. Yeah kill me
03:31:13 Uh, I remember uh when Nate posted the gamer zone thing on twitter
03:31:18 I tweeted at him like, uh, oh you're starting your own podcast, but won't be on the pcp. I see how it is
03:31:26 Yeah, I tweet got a lot of likes
03:31:29 I uh, I'm gonna try and convince him to come on but just because I want to dab on what's his face
03:31:35 Who's always like no, Nate no watch. I want him to post that on a video that has native it
03:31:39 You could never recover from a humiliation of that would be sshc
03:31:44 How was I forget the acronym it's s like schv videos
03:31:48 Right. I remember it was complicated enough that I wasn't gonna bother remembering it
03:31:52 shcw video
03:31:54 He's he's he's doggedly continued his fucking crusade and I again
03:31:59 I don't think he's watching the videos
03:32:02 So you can get him you can just get his ass you just when Nate comes back
03:32:05 You just got to make sure you don't I know you're gonna want to put it in the thumbnail and title
03:32:08 But don't because then you can get his ass and make him say no Nate no watch on a Nate video
03:32:12 And once he does that it doesn't matter what he posts after that because it'll have lost all credibility
03:32:17 The battle will have been why I mean if it's no, how does he say no Nate no watch if he doesn't watch
03:32:23 How does he know there's no I know that's the point he's it's a flaw in his system
03:32:27 His whole ideology is crumbling. It's been working on sills. It's on predictions. He'll trip up
03:32:33 We could make that happen. Okay, Nate will never come back. So maybe he'll accidentally watch it and then he'll be like no
03:32:39 I
03:32:40 Yes, I I did um because Nate hadn't been on an episode in a while
03:32:44 I did take him his channel off the like sidebar
03:32:48 With the expectation that like I could just put it back any time
03:32:52 And he got like kind of mad at me. He was like ben why why you'd message me sort of upset and I was like, jeez, dude
03:32:58 I don't know. I'll put it back
03:33:00 But like whatever it is kind of funny that he would care at all because yeah, I
03:33:05 Think a year I generally think he would care because like he has even at that point
03:33:09 He hadn't been on in like a year and it's just been even longer since
03:33:12 I will just agree with what you said ages ago ben which is why I agree to do game or so
03:33:17 And why I'm going to do this which is that doing a podcast is like a couple hours out of the week
03:33:21 It's not that much time to do. It's truly. It's truly a low commit. I don't understand why so many people seem to think it's like
03:33:27 I mean, Nate has the time clearly. He's doing another podcast. So
03:33:32 That's the funny part. It can't be the time thing. It's just kind of funny. He just doesn't love us anymore
03:33:36 Which really hurts. It hurts. It hurts, Nate
03:33:39 Well, I'm just um, I'm waiting until uh, I'm waiting until I get invited to the gamer zone because I mean I'm
03:33:46 I'm kind of the gamer's tavern
03:33:49 The gamers tavern is the zone is in the zone
03:33:53 Gamers tavern is one such zone. I was pushing we should just call the podcast gamers tavern
03:33:58 We should just steal that from you
03:34:00 That's funny. Yeah, I I made that suggestion in the comments, uh somewhere
03:34:05 I don't I don't understand the mindset of people that oh, let's say like
03:34:08 Sometimes people will say like once she's not for for instance, they'll say yeah, once she's not on the pzp anymore
03:34:14 He's gone on to do bigger and better things and like
03:34:18 I like it's it's fair to say like, okay
03:34:21 Maybe he is doing bigger and better things that might be true
03:34:23 But like the sort of implication that like he he he or or anyone you had to stop doing
03:34:28 You had to stop doing this podcast in order to do something else instead
03:34:33 As though it is not perfectly feasible to slot a three hour podcast into your weekly schedule somewhere
03:34:39 It's not usually also pursuing can do more than one podcast. Look at me for example. I'm on both of them
03:34:45 You're a slut. You're a podcast
03:34:48 You also don't have to uh, you don't have to be on every week either if you're busy on that time
03:34:54 You can just miss out
03:34:55 Yeah, that was the thing like if they just didn't want to be on every episode because that was the thing
03:34:59 He was on every episode for like a very long time. So like I kind of get that if you want to take a break
03:35:03 I mean he can do whatever he wants doesn't have to be on the show
03:35:05 If he doesn't want to be but I don't understand why he does he feel like he can't be on it
03:35:08 It's just I'm confused why people
03:35:11 It's it's it's really not all or nothing. It really doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition
03:35:15 That's what I was thinking like just do it once a month if you aren't feeling it. It's fine or or not
03:35:20 I mean whatever you don't want to be in the show. That's fine. Yeah, that's what I was saying
03:35:22 I don't want to like bully like if he doesn't want to do it doesn't have to do it. It's just like kind of funny to me
03:35:26 it's
03:35:27 It's funny that it's it's just funny that it seems like it's it's such a
03:35:32 Never be on the show again
03:35:34 but also
03:35:36 Never say anything about why ever right like to like take a look what seems to be like a really hard line stance and then never
03:35:42 Refer to it. Yeah. Yeah. If I didn't know any better. It sounds almost like a jaunt run thing
03:35:48 I genuinely don't understand why he cared that I like took his his button off the sidebar
03:35:53 Well, I'm sorry. I didn't even notice it and did you message him saying I'm doing this
03:35:57 No, yeah, I I don't know how he noticed. Honestly. Yeah, it's such a small thing
03:36:01 I I was just like
03:36:03 If if you were on the show, I would just I could just put it back. I don't I am surprised that he noticed actually
03:36:09 um
03:36:11 anyway
03:36:12 Next one is called
03:36:14 to
03:36:16 Angry Nate head. Oh, this is to that guy
03:36:18 Who was mad at us for being for being?
03:36:21 Mean to his boy
03:36:23 Three two one go
03:36:26 So in response to that one guy who was so pissed at you guys for talking Nate just give him one of these
03:36:33 Click here to skip the bad
03:36:36 Hmm
03:36:38 Click here to skip the bad
03:36:41 Uh, maybe he means a timestamp
03:36:43 I
03:36:45 I take offense to this that he thinks you should even go to the trouble of time stamping any of this discussion
03:36:51 Is that what he's saying? I'm not sure. I don't know sure
03:36:55 Dev alchemist, I'm a little I'm a little confused about what you're suggesting. I'm sorry
03:36:58 But I think you should uh timestamp a timestamp the voicemail probably what he's saying
03:37:04 I think is
03:37:06 To the guy who got mad about the Nate
03:37:09 of uh
03:37:11 bullying
03:37:13 We should say hey guy
03:37:15 Here's a timestamp for when you can skip us talking about Nate
03:37:19 But I don't think but that's
03:37:21 I don't know if that would solve the problem. I uh, I don't think that's the problem
03:37:25 I don't think the problem was that he heard about it
03:37:27 I think he was indignant on Nate's behalf that how dare people
03:37:31 Discuss him on this podcast
03:37:32 Which he could easily come on and defend himself at any point if he wanted to that's what I'm saying
03:37:36 Well, he doesn't even have like not only then for permission. He can just literally just establish when we tried to remove him from the
03:37:42 podcast
03:37:43 Association he adamantly refused the thing. So like he's part of this what be brought by his own volition
03:37:52 If he ever wanted to say anything about the pcp, he has the perfect platform here on the show
03:38:00 Right like if he wanted to leave the pcp, he literally could but he doesn't want to
03:38:05 Yeah, but also doesn't ever want to be on
03:38:07 I don't get it
03:38:09 I generally don't understand but I just want the credit without putting in the work
03:38:15 I mean what what credit he's getting with such accolades. He's happy being the pcp accountant. I'm getting his small cut every month
03:38:25 He still does the he still does the the paypal
03:38:29 paperwork the paypal per work
03:38:31 This is still ironically his business
03:38:35 Yeah
03:38:36 Oh, yeah, I guess in a way he's your boss
03:38:40 Yeah
03:38:42 Yeah, legally he worked for us legally. It's his it's his enterprise and we're all getting non-employee compensation
03:38:48 For our cuts at the work viewers ignore what ben says because he's definitely works for his brother
03:38:57 That's a sick burn. I said it's non-employee non-employee compensation. You're a contractor
03:39:04 You got no benefits. I have no benefits
03:39:07 I'm being exploited
03:39:12 Next next voicemail is called one cool dud
03:39:17 three two one go
03:39:19 I've been meaning to mention for a while now
03:39:22 That ben's uwu voice is just like top tier
03:39:29 Like not even joking it genuinely
03:39:33 Makes me feel so happy
03:39:35 and squishy
03:39:37 Whenever you do it
03:39:40 I was wondering if you could possibly use it to say
03:39:44 Uh, not so fast mister. I have a master's degree
03:39:50 That would be extremely choice
03:39:53 Um
03:39:54 Yeah, well, thank you
03:39:57 Um, let me see. What is my uh, I'll try I'll try to do it naturally
03:40:01 Um, I don't know if you do this sounds like uh, not so fast. Mr. I have a master's degree
03:40:09 Well, is that is that?
03:40:12 I think that's not quite it. I think it's just sort of the the high-pitched squeaky thing you do sometimes
03:40:20 When you say thank you and thank you
03:40:23 I have a master's degree. Wait, weren't you weren't you like doing an uwu voice with munchie like a while ago?
03:40:31 And you just kept doing it
03:40:33 I remember kezi talking about that like you would not stop doing the uwu voice and she got really upset or they got really upset
03:40:39 Whoops, I said it again. I fucking misgendered them some somebody somebody. Um
03:40:46 somebody uh, honestly like
03:40:48 When i'm trying to think of my uwu voice like i'm not exactly sure what voice it is like
03:40:53 I would need to hear like a clip and be like that voice when you do that
03:40:57 And then I could be like oh, I can do that you can't do it now because you're too self-conscious about trying to do it
03:41:02 You know what I mean? Now i'm i'm overthinking it. I'm overthinking it. I'm like, wait, like how high do I have to go?
03:41:07 How nasally I think you're just contributing. It's just like replacing all the vowels with w's or however
03:41:13 However, you do it you do it you do it. However, you
03:41:18 I don't know. I think you're you're contributing to this person's uh, joe material
03:41:24 Charge the crystal i'm charging their crystal
03:41:27 You're definitely helping charge that crystal
03:41:30 Next oh wait, uh, don't not this latest one do the one that's three five four eight
03:41:35 This one is george the bird
03:41:37 three two one go
03:41:40 Okay, so we're gonna hotel on the beach
03:41:43 And we have this little seagull
03:41:45 Who is either hurt
03:41:48 Or just a dumb baby and he cannot fly and he's been offended. I've named him george
03:41:54 Um, he doesn't like berries. He doesn't like crackers
03:41:58 But uh, I stole a piece of chilean sea bass that would have gone on a $40 plate from the restaurant
03:42:06 we have
03:42:08 and he likes that so
03:42:12 Seagulls are bougie little shits is my point. I don't know george is a cool guy though
03:42:17 I almost almost I almost just said
03:42:21 Wait seagulls eat fish
03:42:23 And I was like, what else do I think they that would have been embarrassing
03:42:28 All right, it's a good thing. You didn't say I guess they're just scavengers. I guess yeah, I guess they just eat anything
03:42:33 I thought they eat hot dogs. I thought they oh, yeah, like I think of them
03:42:37 Yeah, like trash, but like yeah, of course they eat meat
03:42:40 Like they live at the sea of course they eat fish fish are basically sea trash, so
03:42:46 Fuck fish, you know
03:42:49 Who needs it's like it's like thinking of like what pigeons actually eat if not like bread and and chips
03:42:59 Nobody knows
03:43:02 Yeah, before humans invented garbage
03:43:05 Uh, they didn't pigeons only exist because we invented them to eat our garbage
03:43:09 Because we needed something to clean up after us
03:43:12 And then we needed them to poop on our heads. Yeah, we definitely needed that
03:43:16 We we designed them specifically for all these purposes
03:43:20 Uh next voicemail is called breaking news
03:43:23 three two one go
03:43:26 The Taliban has assumed control of Afghanistan like a month after parking with a tour of the troops, so
03:43:33 That's pretty cool
03:43:35 Yeah
03:43:36 Did you see that picture of the Taliban recreating the Iwo Jima image with cat with captured american like
03:43:44 Uniforms and shit. It was epic
03:43:45 Uh, I saw a picture of a guy posing in front of a bunch of guns that they had gotten from like an abandoned american base
03:43:54 Just another one of those silly Taliban pranks. They're known for
03:43:59 one of their many gaffes and japes and
03:44:03 Uh, it's just classic
03:44:06 Uh, yeah
03:44:07 So, you know, that's cool
03:44:10 I think the Taliban's good, right? We like them. Yeah, that's great
03:44:13 Uh, I think they're the good guys. I can't remember. I remember watching a fake sound. I fucking uh Rambo bluey where they were uh pretty cool
03:44:20 The brave muhajine jine fighters or whatever
03:44:24 The Taliban is uh
03:44:25 Taliban is when you know, I don't know if those are related to each other or not
03:44:29 The Taliban is when you get banned from a forum, right?
03:44:32 Oh, yeah, you get tallyed. No, it's when it's when it's when uh
03:44:37 You you're banned from dating tally in mass effect. No a fate worse than death
03:44:43 Therefore they suck
03:44:46 Well, shit you piss off the Koreans you get tally band
03:44:49 I was I was on the tally band side, but now I have to reconsider
03:44:54 Yeah, I was on their side until I heard their thoughts on the specific mass effect romance and now I'm against them
03:45:00 This makes me reconsider everything I used to think about them
03:45:02 I mean if you fuck up the loyalty mention of mass effect you can't get out banned from for people
03:45:08 That's true. That's also killed
03:45:11 Everybody can die in that game. It's pretty fun. Yeah, you get the watching every single every single person die on the suicide mission
03:45:17 It's actually like hilarious. I don't know why this is like it's like every single thing that can go wrong goes wrong
03:45:22 Like the worst possible way
03:45:25 There's tally band and then there's weird al qaeda
03:45:32 That's a good one. That's solid solid work
03:45:37 Uh, thanks
03:45:39 Thank you
03:45:41 Next voicemail is called
03:45:44 A simple request and this is sent in by
03:45:47 Fattest nuts at hotmail.com
03:45:52 Son of a mention that I believe he means peanuts
03:45:55 I hope delicious keto too. Uh, three two one go
03:46:01 I'm gonna need you to do me a favor go to the gift tab of discord and search
03:46:08 Relax and take notes. I'm gonna give you a few seconds
03:46:16 Okay, so who's getting the best head
03:46:18 Oh, and also a hashtag lynch tommy j. Nobody loves him his voice sounds fucking awful. Oh
03:46:25 Come on the chipmunks
03:46:27 Um
03:46:31 Oh
03:46:35 I don't even know what the chipmunks names are
03:46:37 Alvin simon and theodore right theodore's the green one
03:46:40 Theodore is is like is like in nirvana right now
03:46:45 Yeah, it's the it's definitely theodore's eyes are closed. He's in like he's in like a zone theodore
03:46:51 Alvin is pogging alvin is just straight up
03:46:53 That's just a tuesday for alvin. This is a pog moment
03:46:57 He it's poggers, but he's he but he's still like aware. He's just like yeah, this is pretty cool. He's like consciously reacting
03:47:04 Simon seems to be in discomfort. Yeah, he's like scrunching his eyes
03:47:11 God damn it
03:47:13 That reminds me of that uh video where uh, everyone was
03:47:17 Chastising tom for using the gift thing on twitter. Oh, yeah, tom oliver cringe
03:47:22 The boomer
03:47:28 You you did
03:47:30 I always thought using gift tab was kind of cringe, but then I when I was
03:47:35 Watched that it made me think about can I put it into words? Why and then I was like I kind of can't honestly
03:47:40 So I guess you're uh, you're right
03:47:42 I think you won but you won the legal battle, but you lost in the court of public. I don't know the comments seem pretty
03:47:48 Heavily in my favor. I've I've grown into into enjoying the gift button
03:47:53 Recreationally not just as a meme like haha. I'm using the gift button. Just like
03:47:57 Uh, oh, there's a
03:47:59 I don't have like a folder of these sorts of things and I just want to
03:48:03 Show an image. There's probably a weirdo gift of whatever people are talking about right now
03:48:08 I just find it
03:48:09 I really like I think it's really cool that like if you type in endless war rfck. There is a there are lots of like
03:48:17 Endless war memes that's that show up in the gift tab
03:48:21 Because it just searches gifts. It's not like I yeah once I realized that it's not like a pre picked out boomer approved
03:48:29 List of memes you're allowed to share. It's just like it literally is just like it searches for gifts
03:48:35 Like I can't really be that upset of it then
03:48:37 That was which was the case I was making in the video. I'm glad I've been right retroactively justified and proven correct
03:48:45 Everybody will like uh the gift button sooner or later because everyone becomes a boomer eventually
03:48:51 Exactly. We're just aging into him just ahead of the curve. I think that
03:48:55 I think that
03:48:56 I think that using a gift as a reaction
03:48:59 I mean you can do it once in a while, but I think if you do it all the time
03:49:01 It's a little bit like it's a little bit like low effort
03:49:03 You do it all the time then sure but like I mean there's something inherently wrong with using as gift as a reply
03:49:08 Which is again a reason why I was inherently opposed to the gift button, but I was like well inherently wrong
03:49:13 But I think really wrong. I think it's easy to overdo it
03:49:15 I think it's easy to overdo it like like I typed in cyber show and I get this
03:49:19 Yeah, that's a clip from one of my videos
03:49:21 You can like do a cycle animation where you make Sonic do all his little do all the different animations
03:49:25 He can do in the game and it looks funny. It looks funny
03:49:29 Funny and that was uh back in the early days of cyber show
03:49:34 The early back in the LP days
03:49:37 Uh
03:49:39 I um
03:49:40 Yeah, I can't I should we do it with a whole podcast. It's just boomers bitching about the you know
03:49:47 Best boomers bitching about being old. Yeah two two bad two boomers bitching about
03:49:53 Can we just complain about tick tock and how I hate it?
03:49:57 I do hate tick tock. I can I I don't even want to hate tick
03:50:00 I don't even want to be that guy who's old and hates tick tock, but it's a very little video
03:50:04 Come on. You don't even give me a choice. What blows my mind is like I just I realized literally yesterday
03:50:09 That is like, oh, I need to use tick tock. You know, I hate it. Um, wait, why my because uh
03:50:16 The reach there is ridiculous. You're ignoring a separate youtube. It's not just like a couple zoomies on there. It's a huge ecosystem
03:50:24 Let me explain this to you my my friend my friend. Okay. She started a tick tock
03:50:30 yesterday
03:50:31 And uploaded a video of her a couple videos and like three parts of her unboxing this like uh my hero academia figure in
03:50:39 15 hours her video's got 400,000 views. She gained 2,000 followers and got 50,000 likes
03:50:45 This is where people are getting famous now
03:50:49 But where's the money I'm already a later. No, we're already too late. We're already stuck on youtube
03:50:54 I should do the algorithm. Um, but yeah, I mean it's not though because she just made her account like two days ago
03:50:59 And it's all and like got 2,000 followers right off the bat. Like but that's the same
03:51:03 Yeah
03:51:06 I don't what what could you put on there?
03:51:09 though the like anything
03:51:12 Anything it has a separate like me. I guess if there's anything then there's no no right probably
03:51:16 Have you uh, have any of you seen the youtube shorts thing?
03:51:21 Oh, yeah, the only shorts I watch are yours honestly
03:51:24 I haven't watched mine. Oh, do you do you post? Yeah, you want you post the little tips and tricks
03:51:29 Little tips and yeah, that's what I've been um, I've actually been experimenting with the youtube shorts thing because um
03:51:35 A fellow lp or that I know named karma jolt
03:51:40 He was doing the the shorts like uh sometime last year
03:51:44 And uh, he just exploded in popularity all of a sudden
03:51:48 Like he went from 700 subscribers to 20,000 subscribers in just a few months
03:51:54 YouTube was like pushing shorts really hard like it has like a separate virality thing like on the front page
03:52:00 There's like a tab for shorts and like if you're not making shorts, you're not even playing that part of the game
03:52:04 You know what I mean? You're missing
03:52:06 It sucks to be missing on I know just when you do youtube shorts, uh, the algorithm will push your video much more aggressively
03:52:14 Regardless of what size your channel is because they want to kill tick
03:52:17 Which is why they're pushing. I mean the nice thing is that like if you start using youtube shorts
03:52:22 You might as well just post them on tiktok. It's exactly right. That's sort of what I was like
03:52:25 I was like, I just don't really see them on my channel and then I was like
03:52:28 I'm just lazy but like I see I see in theory why they're doing it
03:52:30 It doesn't make sense like it is objectively algorithmically smart to be fucking around with those shorts. Yes
03:52:36 I don't I don't like engaging in social media that I don't
03:52:41 Actively watch and engage with myself. Yeah, I don't post that's the problem is that every time I've tried to like
03:52:47 Okay, let's see what this tiktok thing is about
03:52:50 I just hate it like I just
03:52:53 It doesn't connect with me at all because like I like sitting down and watching a youtube video that has like some feet on its bones
03:52:59 tiktok is just like
03:53:00 30 seconds of like bite size by design
03:53:03 It's it's like designed for like I don't even want to get too boomery about it
03:53:07 But like it's like we've been breeding attention spans smaller and smaller and we've basically gotten about as small as we can go
03:53:12 Or like 30 15 to 30 second videos are like the what people are aiming for you know
03:53:16 I mean that used to be like abnormal on youtube like I have a meme channel
03:53:19 I'll post 15 30 second videos on but not like that's not a real youtube video, you know
03:53:25 Yeah, I think it just because I like I'm so like focused on like the youtube format in terms of like if I was going to make
03:53:30 Video content. That's what I want to do that moving over to that
03:53:35 Like I don't even like know how it changed
03:53:39 My content to suit it. I wouldn't even know what to make that's really kind of the thing that why I haven't ever messed around with shorts either
03:53:45 It's like what can I
03:53:47 do
03:53:48 Right, you need a different style of content. You can't just yeah
03:53:52 Can't just go over with any type of content like if you have no idea what you're doing
03:53:57 Or why you're doing it. It's going to suffer
03:54:00 Compared to people who have like good ideas
03:54:04 Or passion behind like oh, I love tiktok and I love doing this stuff and they're gonna just
03:54:09 They're gonna have an audience that enjoys tiktok content and if you're right the kids will just be in tiktok audience
03:54:14 Yeah, you'll you'll be stuck doing those things. I mean, I guess you could do a short little like animation
03:54:20 Because I do like 3d model stuff feel a little short animation. Yeah, well that would be good for animation for sure
03:54:26 At least there's that you could have a little looping thing
03:54:28 I just try to I think of the stuff you already have would be really good
03:54:31 Actually, I try to think of the limitations of the the format and find some way to make it interesting to me and the viewers
03:54:37 So I um right that's I mean that's the best way to look at it
03:54:40 You know art comes from adversity like it's not like having a shorter amount of time
03:54:44 Doesn't necessarily mean you have to make worse videos. You just have to think harder
03:54:47 But I don't know I just have to change the what you're doing and I'm not sure
03:54:51 Exactly, right, but I totally get your point like I don't use tiktok. I'm not tuned into the things that go viral on tiktok
03:54:57 So like it's just gonna I'm gonna be at a disadvantage in either way
03:55:00 You know what I mean? I don't like start using it and I don't know if I want to go down that
03:55:04 Something about the way the site is like like so focused on like lip syncing is like abhorrent to me
03:55:11 I just hate everything about it. Basically. I think it's grown to be more because I just know the stats and like
03:55:17 It has more than twitter already
03:55:19 Right or downloads and all that. It's massive gargantuan ecosystem
03:55:23 And that's why I was like, yeah, it doesn't really make sense to completely ignore it
03:55:26 But I don't know. I'm just too lazy to make a tiktok
03:55:29 I think the short thing is uh good for like scripted content because normally when you script something
03:55:35 It takes a long time if you're doing like a long
03:55:38 Uh video and it takes forever to put out the video
03:55:40 But when you're just doing 30 seconds to a minute, right?
03:55:44 It allows you to script stuff and put videos out at a faster pace
03:55:48 Right and you're for your little series of like game tips and tricks and like cheats
03:55:53 Like I feel like a good like people want the videos to be short for those kinds of videos
03:55:57 You know what I mean? Like the shortness sort of works in its favor. You know what I mean?
03:55:59 Yeah, it just seems like the perfect uh combination
03:56:03 I
03:56:04 On the completely opposite side of like oh intentions getting shorter and shorter
03:56:09 Um, Noah called will jevaze. Oh, yeah, his resident evil video. Did you watch his resident?
03:56:14 I watched the seven hour resident evil video. I'm very close to the end
03:56:18 I'm on resident evil seven. He's seven hours. Yeah, it's he he's his videos are really good
03:56:25 They're often very very long very thorough very in-depth like great analysis
03:56:31 Uh, that's witty and not like stupid. Yeah, he doesn't get bogged down
03:56:36 It doesn't it's like a seven hour video that is packed full
03:56:40 With like literally he literally could have just he could have just like divided it up and be like here's my video on
03:56:46 Resident Evil 1 here's my video resident evil 2 like people wouldn't have even thought it was weird
03:56:49 But like it's just like he literally just chose to do it all in one video because you know, why not?
03:56:53 I can't I can't imagine
03:56:55 Scripting out a seven hour video that would take yeah, that would take months. The thing is like somebody will hear how many pages that is
03:57:02 He um, like you'll hear him like read stuff and somebody will hear him like make a little mistake or something in the video
03:57:06 And it's like whatever and pardon me was like, oh, that's kind of like unprofessional in a weird way
03:57:10 But then I was like, you know what at the end of the day
03:57:13 It was like literally who gives a fuck if I can hear him do a mouse click it doesn't
03:57:16 Know it's always been like that
03:57:17 He's always just like he just leaves his like miss his like miss words and like he'll stumble and he'll just leave it
03:57:23 It's just funny because like I would never do that to me
03:57:25 I would be like, oh god, I gotta re-record that, you know, but it's like at the end of the day
03:57:28 He made me realize like I don't even need to do that
03:57:29 You know what I mean? Like he doesn't care and like the end the audience doesn't care and I don't so yeah, it doesn't matter
03:57:34 Yeah, I had the same realization
03:57:37 Well, now there's no reason to you know, try to make videos
03:57:39 I sure ever but like there's no reason to overly get obsessed with your presentation to the point where it's like a problem
03:57:44 You know what I mean? Like I appreciate that sort of minimalistic
03:57:47 I would I would rather him make twice as many videos than half as many and I actually really appreciate all the little verbal
03:57:52 That his shit's not that flashy like his video like his page run credit to him
03:57:56 Just standing in front of the camera reading off a list, you know, I mean it's so long
03:57:59 It's him say for like 15 minutes just reading names
03:58:01 It's a half an hour at the end of the video
03:58:03 I agree with you like I who sits through that who doesn't just immediately turn the video off as soon as they get to that part
03:58:08 Like it's gotten to the point that I I can't like I understand the I totally get why he does that
03:58:12 He said in his thing. I'm if you give me a certain amount of money, I'll little read your name off
03:58:16 But like it's it's become cumbersome. It's become so long and almost
03:58:19 Unlike counterproductive. I don't know. I like that aspect. It's it doesn't hurt the video because you can just turn it off
03:58:24 Exactly. It's not like oh, he better stop doing that. Like I don't care in that for a second. It's just it's a very long at this point
03:58:30 It's not a very silent. It's not sometimes I'll hear like hear my friends names. The reason I brought him up though
03:58:34 um was
03:58:36 As a contrast to the tiktok stuff and it shows right because he's getting more
03:58:41 attention than he used to have like he was a lot smaller and
03:58:44 Niche and people are discovering his stuff and like it's so good and there's so much of it
03:58:50 That it's you're absolutely right. Give that like it's not just short videos. It gives me like hope that like
03:58:55 Like long form good stuff is not like going out of there's there's definitely a split here
03:59:01 There's a split here the the the shame a seven hour pokemon analysis did gangbusters. It's got like a million and a half views
03:59:07 I'm sure it's made like I'm sure it's made like $10,000
03:59:11 Becoming so long is like it becomes like the point of I have noticed that
03:59:15 A lot of uh longer form videos are getting popular
03:59:18 Which is why I thought well, what if I if I tried doing both of those
03:59:22 You know the short videos and a couple of long videos every I think the reason that they're both getting really successful
03:59:27 Is that like the short videos like shorts are just like people like actively watching a little bite-sized things
03:59:32 And then the long videos are like, oh, I gotta do something
03:59:34 I'll put this over to a new tab
03:59:36 And I'll just like do whatever I need to do play my game
03:59:39 Watch do my homework whatever while it's playing in the background
03:59:42 I would love if there was like an analytic to show how much of like like
03:59:47 Watch time is like actually looking at the video versus playing in the background because I guarantee you videos like that is like 90
03:59:53 We were talking about that like yes, so many people use youtube as like youtube videos as like podcasts
03:59:58 You know what I mean?
03:59:59 Either on a separate monitor or on a separate tab so they can't even literally can't even see it at all
04:00:04 Right, I mean like so and you're right
04:00:05 So if you could see this that's an image on the screen and then they have to tab over to check you have to look at the screen
04:00:10 You can't be this is a visual podcast now
04:00:13 But that's probably why it would be better to
04:00:17 Focus on the scripting more than everything else right that is honestly the most important part. Yeah
04:00:23 It's it's kind of weird that it is like if you if you could look at the stats
04:00:26 It would be some
04:00:27 Dishearteningly huge number like 50% of the people who watch your videos don't actually physically watch your videos
04:00:34 But like yeah, why does he care? He doesn't even like I mean sometimes he'll show relevant games
04:00:39 No, I was saying that's like smart for Noah Gervais to like his he does right
04:00:42 He doesn't have flash yet any he basically has relevant but not like super duper relevant videos of what's going on
04:00:48 You know, which is the smart way to do it honestly
04:00:49 But I like to you know people guys like me and you guys like Nate, you know
04:00:52 Get so obsessed with the visual editing in the visual language of it all which is like just you know
04:00:57 Not that it doesn't matter, but it's not as matter
04:01:00 It matters more for certain kinds of videos. You're right. It does depend a lot on the specific kind of video essays
04:01:06 Yeah, I feel like it mostly is about the audio
04:01:10 and
04:01:11 I mean if you're making like a 15 to 20 minute like dense video
04:01:15 You definitely want good
04:01:16 I think most people are probably or a good amount of people are going to watch that because it's short enough to like
04:01:21 I'm like
04:01:22 I know like when I was like Trixie all the time with like make food and then go downstairs and watch a YouTube video
04:01:27 Like actively engage with it while eating then be done and move on to whatever else they do
04:01:31 So like I'm sure like people find little chunks of time in their day to like watch a dense video like that
04:01:37 But I think if you're going for like an hour plus like
04:01:40 Just do the bare minimum for visuals. Yeah
04:01:42 Don't get too bogged down on every single like thing on screen being perfectly relevant to the sentence
04:01:49 You're saying especially for hour long because it takes so long to do good video visual editing on hour plus long videos
04:01:54 So it might take you to do it, but it's hard take years if you're going to do something seven hours long
04:02:00 Imagine working on one video for a couple of years
04:02:03 It's interesting like you can imagine trick people into thinking you have decent editing when you actually don't if you just cut
04:02:09 With like every like yeah, do it on the rhythm do it like so yeah
04:02:13 They're constantly seeing new things like just put be putting in new fucking images or cutting to things
04:02:17 As long as you cut with the speech rhythm it feels like there's actual editing even though you're just I had to realize that
04:02:22 Keep their neurons fired. I try not to be too cynical about it
04:02:25 But I was like, you know a lot of people watching videos are just like dumb sheep and they just want things to be flashing in front of their eyes
04:02:30 So don't let them get bored. You can't let them get bored
04:02:34 But like 100 it really is true though. Honestly like when you're thinking as an entertainer you really have to be like
04:02:39 Okay, don't you can't give them any debate or got to keep them visually interested or if not visually then you know
04:02:45 It depends on the kind of video
04:02:45 I guess we said that a few times one thing that really
04:02:48 annoys me a rubs me it makes me click off immediately is if there's like
04:02:52 You know a video about some subject or whatever and it starts with like an editing
04:02:57 Slash voiceover like comedy bit that doesn't land. I'm like, okay
04:03:03 Humor is definitely a mixed bag where it's like
04:03:06 If you're being funny, it just wasn't it was like it felt like a
04:03:11 If you're gonna lead with a joke it better not be annoying. That's why it became such a meme like so many bad reviewers
04:03:17 Like like jokes that are just they have the sound and sense and like
04:03:22 structure of like what a joke is but
04:03:24 I don't feel like they found it funny when they wrote it or decided to do it and they're like
04:03:29 Oh, we need to put in a joke here because when I watch reviews they put in for a joke time for a wacky edit
04:03:34 Something I really
04:03:35 Genuinely appreciated about like know what your face is that he doesn't feel the need to needlessly insert jokes
04:03:39 I'll have like one joke an hour, but it'll actually be a funny joke. You know what I mean?
04:03:43 Yeah, probably because he actually thought the joke was good and not because it
04:03:48 Right. Yeah, he doesn't he doesn't just put them in because he wants and they help him if he thinks if something comes up
04:03:54 It's not like you have to rid them
04:03:55 You know jokes are pretty difficult to do you can't just write something and it's good
04:03:59 You have to kind of workshop it and polish it and just doing one joke can take a very large amount of time
04:04:06 Right and it's sort of mean to say but some people just aren't fucking funny and if you're not funny
04:04:11 That's fine. Just don't try to be funny. Just make your video and don't
04:04:15 Be unfunny in it. I have
04:04:17 I remember many times for my own like hypocrite videos where I
04:04:22 Was writing and I'm like I gotta put some joke in there and I did just put it in there
04:04:27 And I didn't find it funny at the time. I still don't that and I'm like, oh this sucks
04:04:32 Oh, I'm such a fucking loser for doing that
04:04:36 Well, I think most of your jokes were pretty good if I remember people don't know though. Yeah, sometimes
04:04:42 it's it's fine and people don't recognize that because like
04:04:47 comedy
04:04:48 Senses of humor differ some people find everything funny
04:04:52 Some people have very strict like it needs to be like very funny for me to laugh
04:04:58 Doing good comedy is hard
04:05:00 It's it's different than when you're just doing a straight analysis where you can just
04:05:04 Write stuff and you don't have to think too hard about everything you're writing
04:05:08 But when you write a joke, you have to write one line and you really have to spend a lot of time on it
04:05:14 Just going over it and thinking, you know, is this really funny?
04:05:17 Maybe you have to tell it to someone and see if they react to it
04:05:22 You know, like one line takes forever
04:05:25 With a you know, with a joke or one like skit or one sketch you're gonna do
04:05:29 You gotta get your tight five. It's easy to like just pat out like an analytical video
04:05:34 It's way harder to like pat out just insert five minutes of like jokes, you know
04:05:38 I mean like I guess you can't do it, but it's harder for them to be good
04:05:41 It's harder for them to be good, you know, you can't pat out the comedy and have it still be funny
04:05:47 Right, but some people really feel like they need it like they they've watched they grew up watching videos of a certain way
04:05:51 You know like angry video game nerd nostalgia critic
04:05:53 They just they just in their mind a youtube video has of guy and standing in front of a camera making bad jokes
04:05:58 Like that's just like what it is in their mind's eye. They can't envision it without that
04:06:03 Which is not you gotta be thinking
04:06:05 The more you think about what you're doing the better it'll probably be probably
04:06:11 Nah
04:06:13 It is kind of funny that youtube and I don't know tick talking to social media in general
04:06:17 Does seem to want to like prioritize like don't be like thinking about your content
04:06:21 Just be filming everything just be pumping out vlogs, you know
04:06:25 You don't need to think about your content. You just need to make it as fast as you can
04:06:29 Right. Yeah, that's what works best for that because they make the most money. I do dislike that though
04:06:35 I I I prefer thoughtful content
04:06:39 I mean does it does it make
04:06:41 I guess it
04:06:42 Does it make more money if you're like a family
04:06:45 Channel and you can be putting out videos daily that get like
04:06:49 Does it mean more ads does the shorter less
04:06:53 Most people aren't watching youtube with an ad blocker
04:06:55 So if there's like a billion bad videos and you're looking for something to watch you have to click through 10 videos
04:06:59 That's 10 ads youtube gets to make instead of you landing on right video and that's sort of
04:07:04 That's sort of why youtube is like doing this thing where it's favoring really long content
04:07:08 Which can have tons and tons of ads shoved in or just lots of short content that will chain into each other
04:07:13 You know what I mean and be like, uh, well auto plays on by default. I think they keep on so yeah
04:07:17 They just love to have shit auto play from one video to the next to the next
04:07:21 Well, here's an idea. What if you just made a really long video and then you cut it up into a bunch of short videos
04:07:27 And you just upload everything
04:07:29 what
04:07:32 Couldn't if you guys were smart
04:07:33 You would be recording one podcast like this a month and then breaking up another 10 minute chunks, which are we should 10 ads
04:07:41 We should cut this podcast up into like like youtube short length
04:07:47 300 different youtube short seconds, then you're really going to be playing the algorithm
04:07:53 Do you think of all the ads?
04:07:55 Think of all the content
04:07:56 Oh my god
04:07:58 You should be ideally aiming for a one-to-one is wasted content
04:08:02 Exactly you should be aiming for a one-to-one ad to content ratio
04:08:05 You're spending half your time watching ads and half your time actually getting around to watch the content
04:08:10 It's dystopian
04:08:14 Um, just uh, just just
04:08:16 But it's like and then we can release a new tick tock size clip of the podcast like every fucking
04:08:23 Five minutes for like the next week and the algorithm will be like, oh, they're all everyone is watching so many of these videos
04:08:30 Like the algorithms exploding
04:08:33 It is stupid shit like that where it's like that would be an increase in like views to the channel
04:08:37 Technically probably just because of how many videos you'd be pumping out. So the algorithm would like be looking at your channel
04:08:43 Looks like it's doing good right now. The terrible thing is that that might actually work
04:08:47 Yeah, the sad part is it would work better than anything. Obviously to the degree. We're saying which was ridiculous like
04:08:53 301 minute shorts would be kind of clog people's feet up
04:08:55 But like in general just taking content and just shopping it up and cramming in as many ads
04:09:01 It is a smart thing to do frame
04:09:03 Yeah, one frame videos at a time like you can't even get any shorter than upload them every every four nanoseconds
04:09:11 I have a weird respect for these people who can just churn out content like dsp the dark side fill
04:09:16 How many videos do you have now dsp gaming has 59
04:09:21 Thousand videos on his youtube account 59. What the thousand? It's because every single day. He's doing this. He's upload
04:09:27 He's um, he's putting out segmented live streams like multiple parts every single day
04:09:33 How many minutes does he do like
04:09:37 I went to the channel uh one time and I saw that he does like five six ten videos a day or something like that
04:09:43 Yeah, he'll like stream on twitch or something. I can't remember and then he'll split them all up into one hour long videos
04:09:48 So he'll usually stream like six eight hours a day. So that's like six eight videos a day for like 10 plus years
04:09:54 So if you're a phil fan, you'll be you'll be happy for the rest of your life. You'll never
04:10:03 That is impressive. I'm right. That's what I mean. Like he's really gaming the system
04:10:07 I guess his video is only get between like 200 to 900 views, but he puts out so fucking many every single fucking day
04:10:15 I like big number. That's I like I I'm a fan now
04:10:20 He you can't help but respect it a little bit the the sheer grind of this man
04:10:25 He can't be as dumb as he looks
04:10:27 He seems to know what he's doing something right
04:10:30 Man, I sure do hate what he does
04:10:32 But I just respect the hell that he just keeps doing his content
04:10:36 But I respect to the degree to which he churns it out in a mechanical way
04:10:40 Dedication is something so dumb. I'm a I've come around and become a big a big fan. I'm a big phil guy now
04:10:47 Hmm
04:10:50 Wow, that was a long fucking tangent
04:10:52 To go on. I was a tangent upon tangents. It was something something related to a voicemail
04:10:57 But I can't even remember we've got we've got exactly one voicemail left. Oh, good. We did it. I know
04:11:04 Wait, unless wait, maybe there's an extra one. No
04:11:07 I can't believe you accept voicemails like like you refresh the page as we're doing the episode until we finish
04:11:14 Until we finish recording you can sneak them in at the last second. Don't tell them that
04:11:19 Yeah, don't tell them that it's too late.
04:11:21 Next week, we're going to get like 50 voicemails in the last 20 minutes
04:11:25 Wait until you guys are doing the episode and then just like non-stop start cranking out voicemails
04:11:30 Like you get your friends to like putting out like three or four a minute
04:11:33 So you just like it's like you can't finish them. There's too many coming in at once
04:11:36 That'd be a great prank Ben is giving everyone tips on how to harass
04:11:41 To pcp with voicemails. Yeah, because I'm not a coward
04:11:45 Ben takes pleasure in making the rest of us suffer through all of these give them a road map
04:11:51 A little not only do you give them tips, but you actively are like I will never screen any calls
04:11:56 You can put anything you want in these calls anything
04:12:00 That's including that's my that's my gig. That's my that's my gig
04:12:06 Uh, anyway, let's play this last one. It's called the human comedy perpetuates itself
04:12:11 three two one go
04:12:14 By 2050
04:12:15 The the new pcp pcp next generation will be composed of
04:12:20 May and neaton house, baby
04:12:23 Uh, a fully artificial intelligence version of azumi
04:12:27 Tom because tom will never die
04:12:29 Uh cyber shell and monkey jones
04:12:33 That's gonna be the next generation
04:12:35 That's quite a lineup. It's like star trek the next generation, but I
04:12:40 I think I would go with sigh instead of monkey jones
04:12:43 Did I mention that I asked sigh if he wanted to guess and he just straight up was like no no
04:12:47 Oh now now he's too good for the pcp. Yeah, now. He suddenly is too good
04:12:54 You would have done it five years ago when it was yeah, you know when it was relevant it mattered at all
04:13:00 Give it now that it's useless and there's no point suddenly. You won't do it
04:13:03 What's that about just a tricksy fan boy like and so obviously you wouldn't want to be on the show now, right?
04:13:09 uh
04:13:11 sigh was also a monkey friend, I think to a degree they they fell out
04:13:16 Yeah, that sounds about but they they liked each other at the time
04:13:20 Right. I don't know if it seemed always a bit weird to me like monkey would just make fun of sigh
04:13:27 I would be like yeah
04:13:29 When you're the butt of the joke, that's just how monkey acts towards everyone. I guess only we can have them on the podcast
04:13:36 He's performatively cruel just and then like makes a joke out of it. I guess that's just his thing
04:13:43 uh
04:13:45 We he wouldn't he didn't want to talk about tricksy and like I don't want to just have him on just for no reason
04:13:50 It wouldn't be no reason. It would be assembling the next generation of avengers to assemble
04:13:56 I I like that. It's just it's just tom. It's just cyborg tom
04:14:01 And like ai Izumi
04:14:03 That exists
04:14:04 Ai Izumi did monkey refuse to talk about trick me and Ethan Ralph's child. Did they say
04:14:11 Yeah, Ethan and Ethan and may his child is the the front man
04:14:17 He didn't exactly he just I asked him if he wanted to come on and talk about tricksy on the show
04:14:22 And he just said I don't want to talk about her. That's very different from do you want to be on the show at all?
04:14:30 Well, yeah, no, I asked him specifically for that reason. Okay. Well, that's a different
04:14:36 Okay. Yeah, I that that's what I said. Okay. That's what they said. I have not changed my story
04:14:41 Um, that's a pretty uh pretty unusual reaction coming from him
04:14:45 Yeah, I was surprised. I don't know if the issue was um, but uh, uh, uh, uh, anyway
04:14:53 dead dead podcast, uh, new generation
04:14:59 Ethan and Ralph's fucking cursed. Ethan and May's cursed, baby. Uh,
04:15:04 Who else? I don't know. Whatever. Yeah, mum key jams. Why not?
04:15:07 Uh, I'm disappointed that I was Nate will finally come back to to take take the reins after the new generation
04:15:14 Our assembles after the rest of us are all dust except tom. Obviously
04:15:19 Um, I'm disappointed. I wasn't mentioned in that
04:15:25 Oh, you're oh, you're getting no, you're getting the ax along with the rest of us
04:15:30 Well, that's uh, then you can just ask me a question
04:15:34 You will not be spared in the revolution my friend
04:15:41 Okay, 360 no scope revolution
04:15:44 Exactly, I uh, I guess that's it. That's all the voicemails. Uh, what what do we do and the show
04:15:52 And the podcast and the podcast is the last episode. Chill the things
04:15:57 patreon.com slash the procrastinators for bonus episodes
04:16:01 One of these days we will get a whole bunch of those bonus episodes. Oh, yeah
04:16:05 Let's chill for love web again. Just put it at the top of the description. Oh, yeah
04:16:08 Go check out love web shadow
04:16:11 YouTube
04:16:12 If you haven't seen it yet, okay. Yeah, if you are like animation love web
04:16:16 If you're a pcp fan and you like somehow have not seen love web
04:16:19 What the fuck you're basically missing out on like some of the only new real
04:16:24 It's it's got ben's voice and it's got munchies. Oh, it's so good. You should watch it if you haven't watched it
04:16:28 What the fuck is your problem like seriously like you're seriously watching pcp in 2021
04:16:32 But you're not gonna like listen to us tell you to watch another thing. What is the point?
04:16:37 You piece of shit wasted wasted four hours of your life listening to our twaddle
04:16:41 And and you you could have been spending that you could have watched our love web
04:16:45 The problem is you have to you have to watch love web in its own tab this you can just put another tab
04:16:51 Yeah, that one isn't one of the videos you're talking about earlier. That's actually worth watching with your eyeballs
04:16:56 You're making a bold assumption that if somebody sat through all four four hours of this
04:17:00 Oh, I mean if they're listening to this point odds are
04:17:02 I'd say this is some how a dead podcast yet you the listener are listening to it right now
04:17:07 I think most people they just uh, most people they just click off after the voicemails start
04:17:13 No, most people those people skip directly to the voicemails. The voice mails are the best for the show
04:17:17 One person in the comments asked me. Can we just get a time stamp for the voicemails?
04:17:22 I just want to listen to the voicemails and I was like
04:17:25 What a Chad. What an absolute Chad. I could not believe it. That is uh, that's a sigma male move
04:17:31 Yeah, absolutely. I only want to listen to the part of the show that I'm on my voicemails
04:17:36 It might be it might be that maybe they maybe they're avoid if you're a voicemailer. I understand why you would prefer that segment
04:17:42 Uh, is sigma from megaman x a sigma male?
04:17:48 Yeah
04:17:50 I think so
04:17:51 He's he's alpha. He's the boss. I think wait. No, well, he's a renegade. So
04:17:57 Ah, jeez
04:18:00 patreon.com slash the procrastinators for the bonus episodes and the minecraft server
04:18:05 Yeah, I'm still another heckles for shackles. Yeah, let's do one this week
04:18:08 I'm still waiting for the bonus episode that you guys recorded. Uh,
04:18:13 I think cybershell and
04:18:15 Yeah, it was so long ago. It's it's edited. It just needs to get released. It was a dog's age ago
04:18:22 Yeah, I know but we um
04:18:25 We need to change the the the the the the
04:18:29 The um, what's the word the playlist the playlist url. Yeah, like non patrons have we should change it because like
04:18:35 The non patrons have access to you. It's time to update it
04:18:38 We need to do a little like a little some a little something
04:18:41 To keep it like to keep it, you know for the people who are actually you should just have a post
04:18:47 A pinned post which you can do on patreon
04:18:50 Where you just have links to all the episodes and don't don't have a playlist on youtube that way if you unplug you can't get to the post
04:18:56 You can't see the episode
04:18:59 Yeah
04:19:00 Yeah, that sounds reasonable
04:19:02 Maybe we should we should set it up that way
04:19:05 Uh, yeah, okay. That sounds like a good idea. Well, we'll get those up soon and then there's a lot
04:19:11 There's like three episodes and one of them is really really long. Maybe you should uh hire riley to manage all your stuff
04:19:17 I know we could really use a marriage and we could really use some producing
04:19:21 Some production chops on this uh on this project. You need to produce those last manager
04:19:27 I what I need a guest. I need guests on the podcast and I would really rather it be
04:19:33 A local rapper from elco nevada. Like who do I know?
04:19:38 Who do I know that could get me someone like that?
04:19:41 No one
04:19:42 You'll never get any good guests. You'll be stuck with bottom of the barrel shit to your guests. Like uh
04:19:48 Like gamers havern over here
04:19:50 Yeah, but that guy
04:19:53 Uh
04:19:54 Gamershavern.com go to it
04:19:57 Yes
04:19:59 Uh, yeah mad pros are actually having a website by the way
04:20:02 We're like one of the last 10 people on the internet who still has a website
04:20:05 Yeah, for some reason I didn't have the good chance to stop after I started in 2002
04:20:11 I I miss the days of personal websites. I hate that. It's all that it's all been agglomerated on social media networks
04:20:19 Is that uh, is that almost 20 years old now?
04:20:23 Yep, it'll be 19. The site's uh, 20 year anniversary is coming soon
04:20:28 Holy fuck either or be square dude pretty soon the gamers tavern will be old enough to drink alcohol
04:20:36 Yeah, the brand itself
04:20:38 Hmm
04:20:40 It's already old enough to vote
04:20:42 Probably devoted in the last website should be allowed to vote too
04:20:46 I think so they're they're people too
04:20:49 Uh, okay, we gotta we gotta wrap this episode up
04:20:51 Uh, anything else we have to shill shackles or hackles will stream the pcb minecraft server patreon.com
04:20:56 Slice the procrastinators minecraft server access and the bonus episodes and I guess that's at speak pipe.com slash
04:21:03 PCP voicemail did I get that right? If you want to leave a voicemail message, um
04:21:08 Is that it? Yeah
04:21:11 Okay, that's the end of the episode. Thanks for sticking with me. Goodbye and god speed
04:21:18 See ya
