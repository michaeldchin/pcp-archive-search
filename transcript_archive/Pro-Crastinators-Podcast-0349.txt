00:00:41 Wow.
00:00:42 What, woke virus?
00:00:44 I'm suffering from the broke virus.
00:00:47 Eight we all brother.
00:00:53 What?
00:00:54 I was playing Battle Network.
00:00:56 I was playing, I didn't stream for a whole month and then I played Mega Man Battle Network
00:01:01 again the other day on stream and the running joke in that game for, in the stream there
00:01:09 is that Wiley is spreading the woke mind virus and that's what's making the machines go haywire.
00:01:14 That's the bit.
00:01:15 That's, we have fun here.
00:01:17 I wouldn't, I wouldn't be.
00:01:18 We have fun on twitch.tv slash stcomics.
00:01:20 Subscribe.
00:01:21 I wouldn't be surprised that Wiley is spreading the woke virus.
00:01:26 As you say, it is a particular set of people with a very, very distinguished feature in
00:01:32 the center of their nose that Wiley obviously shares with a specific group of people.
00:01:38 In the center of their nose.
00:01:40 Is Germanic.
00:01:41 Wiley is Germanic.
00:01:42 In the center of their face.
00:01:43 In the center of their face, I mean.
00:01:44 In the center of their nose is that distinctive mole.
00:01:47 He's good Germanic.
00:01:48 We all know what that means.
00:01:49 You know, it'd be a really funny like Mandela effect if it turns out that like, like let's
00:01:54 say someone tweets out, hey, do you all notice that Wiley Sprite has like a yarmulke and then
00:01:59 everyone goes back to all the old Mega Man.
00:02:01 Oh my God, it's always been there.
00:02:03 What the fuck?
00:02:04 Oh no.
00:02:05 Wait, what the fuck?
00:02:06 He's just always wearing a yarmulke.
00:02:07 That wasn't a bold spot.
00:02:08 No, he was wearing a yarmulke the whole time.
00:02:10 Mega Man, the rootless, the rootless cosmopolitan's are destroying society.
00:02:15 Go fight, fight them for everlasting peace, Mega Man.
00:02:18 Damn, this is fucked up.
00:02:19 There were themes in these games we never even picked up on.
00:02:22 Damn.
00:02:23 That is fucked up.
00:02:24 This is deep.
00:02:25 I totally missed it.
00:02:26 Yeah.
00:02:27 It's crazy.
00:02:28 It's like the goblins.
00:02:29 Just like the Harry Potter goblins.
00:02:30 Maybe Kanye was on to something here.
00:02:33 Well, when he talks about Mega Man.
00:02:35 Yeah.
00:02:36 Yeah.
00:02:37 Yeah, he said he loved all of you.
00:02:38 When Kanye had his Mega Man video essay.
00:02:41 Kanye said he loved all robot masters.
00:02:44 He's loved them all.
00:02:46 He loves each and every one of them because he's a Christian.
00:02:49 I love all Reploids, Maverick and non-Maverick.
00:02:53 There's good people on both sides.
00:02:56 I love Sigma.
00:02:58 I love him.
00:02:59 Sigma made some good points.
00:03:02 I love Sigma.
00:03:04 What did Kanye say?
00:03:07 This is awesome.
00:03:09 Stupid.
00:03:10 This is awesome.
00:03:11 I love war criminals.
00:03:14 This is great.
00:03:15 I'm having a great time with my friends on the podcast.
00:03:19 Speaking of war criminals, I'm going to become one right now.
00:03:26 Go on.
00:03:27 I'm going to talk about a dream I had.
00:03:29 That's right.
00:03:30 I'm pulling a maze.
00:03:31 No, not a dream.
00:03:32 Don't worry.
00:03:33 It's quick.
00:03:34 This was like right before I woke up and there was a character in there who was either
00:03:37 Ben St. or Cheesy Manfredo or Chris Reagan.
00:03:40 One of the three.
00:03:41 I don't know which one.
00:03:43 The iconic trio.
00:03:45 It's Reagan.
00:03:46 I don't know why.
00:03:48 I'll keep it brief.
00:03:49 I was at an apartment complex and there was just a big stretch of apartment buildings
00:03:56 that somehow I had spray-painted like a giant mural of like 30 or so popular female characters,
00:04:05 butts just all posing on the side of his building.
00:04:08 The mural was so good.
00:04:09 It was just so nice and free-dimension and their butts were poking out and I spray-painted
00:04:12 this whole thing.
00:04:13 Your dreams are just like your real life.
00:04:18 The paintings extended into the fucking rooms and if you walk through like the top floor
00:04:22 of the apartments, like we're like around where the bus were, like each room that one of the
00:04:27 characters was like against, like the entire inside of a room would be like painted like
00:04:31 in the theme of like whatever media property they're from and someone had labeled the doors
00:04:35 safe for work, not safe for work since I'd done that.
00:04:38 And for several days, the apartments had not noticed, but then they did notice.
00:04:41 And then I was running to escape because I realized people were coming and the guy who
00:04:47 was either Ben St. or cheese and Manfredo or Chris Reagan ran up to open a gate to let
00:04:52 me out.
00:04:53 The guy walking next to me, there's a guy in a white shirt, one of those undershirts that
00:04:58 you usually wear a suit over, the white shirt with the buttons at the top sort of thing.
00:05:02 It was Joe Biden who was wearing his aviated glasses.
00:05:04 He was speed walking next to me.
00:05:06 He's like, the butt heist, we've got to cover the butt heist.
00:05:09 And I'm like, oh, no, the butt heist.
00:05:11 And I went to grab my phone because I wanted to record Joe Biden talking about the butt
00:05:14 heist because I thought this is going to be so fucking funny.
00:05:16 Joe Biden talking about a butt heist and looking at these giant anime butts.
00:05:20 And then I couldn't find my phone.
00:05:22 And I woke up.
00:05:24 I was having a dream yesterday morning and I was, I was, I don't remember what it was,
00:05:33 but I had the, I remember I was like half asleep.
00:05:36 I was like, huh, this is nice.
00:05:38 I'm having a dream.
00:05:39 I don't remember what it was.
00:05:40 And then my alarm went off and instantly, instantly I forgot what the dream was.
00:05:44 And instantly I was sad again because I remembered that the previous night, my brother, Nate Bestman,
00:05:51 betrayed me by not raiding my stream, even though he could have done it.
00:05:55 He had every opportunity to raid my stream and he refused.
00:05:58 He callously refused.
00:06:00 What kind of, what kind of a, what kind of a, what kind of a brother?
00:06:03 What kind of a brother wouldn't raid your own stream?
00:06:06 Wouldn't raid his own brother's stream?
00:06:08 Calously refused.
00:06:10 All right.
00:06:11 And all you've done for him is how you refuse.
00:06:14 True.
00:06:15 I literally had, okay, oblivion.
00:06:21 I linked you a video that I really liked the other day.
00:06:24 I don't know if you got around to watching it, but.
00:06:26 Oh shit.
00:06:27 You did link me a video that I did.
00:06:29 I recommended you a video.
00:06:31 That's okay.
00:06:32 Well, I found this channel.
00:06:33 The channel, the guy is called Geno7 and his, his bit is that he's basically doing what's it called.
00:06:44 It's like every frame of painting, but instead of about like video and movie making,
00:06:49 it's, it's about like sound design and composition is his, is his thing.
00:06:55 He did a video.
00:06:56 He just had one that was like a hit and it's about the sound design of Wario Land 4.
00:07:02 And in, in that video, he talks about the ending theme song for the good ending is this song with lyrics,
00:07:10 which is unusual for a, for a Game Boy Advance game.
00:07:13 But there's a song with lyrics and the song is about the opening line is,
00:07:18 Oh, the dream that I had last night melted into my pillow and all I'd gathered turned into sand.
00:07:27 And that was me.
00:07:28 I woke up and the dream that I had last night melted into my pillow.
00:07:32 It was exactly like that.
00:07:34 You know, you're right.
00:07:35 Wow.
00:07:36 What do we think?
00:07:37 I think, I think that's horrendous.
00:07:39 Last week, you talked about Homer having that dream about the invention and then Marge woke him up
00:07:46 because oh, it's a couple minutes before we usually go to bed.
00:07:48 Wake up so you can go to bed again in five minutes.
00:07:51 I experienced like that only it was morning.
00:07:53 I had a dream where this was like maybe five or six days ago.
00:07:56 I was in some kind of, some kind of glade, some kind of forest glade at night.
00:08:01 And they were like bioluminescent glowing like pink flowers and shit.
00:08:04 It was really cool.
00:08:05 And Princess Luna and Princess Celestia were just sitting on a hill and they were hot.
00:08:09 Wow.
00:08:10 And I started fingering them and it was great and we were going to have sex.
00:08:13 Jesus.
00:08:14 And then Kai woke me up in the middle of my dream and I'm like, why?
00:08:17 I never have sex dreams.
00:08:18 How fucking dare you?
00:08:19 You screamed at him.
00:08:20 You screamed at him so loud.
00:08:22 You took this from me.
00:08:24 I woke up and I immediately attacked him.
00:08:26 I went into attack mode.
00:08:28 Kai never usually wakes me up.
00:08:30 Is this the dream cast?
00:08:33 No.
00:08:34 Oh my gosh.
00:08:35 Dream cast?
00:08:36 Dream cast?
00:08:37 I don't have any dreams.
00:08:38 I never have dreams.
00:08:40 Oh no.
00:08:42 I don't remember them.
00:08:43 Dreams.
00:08:44 I had one weird one recently, but I just forgot it.
00:08:47 So I'm not going to say it.
00:08:49 Wacky.
00:08:50 Yo, I just, that guy, that channel, I really was really impressed by what the content
00:08:57 on offer on that Geno7 channel.
00:08:59 And it's interesting because he had like, he had like 3,000 subscribers, right?
00:09:03 Tiny channel.
00:09:04 I found this Wario video.
00:09:07 I think when I found it, it had like maybe 50K views, you know, a somewhat respectable
00:09:11 amount of views.
00:09:12 I think it has now hit like 100K.
00:09:15 And I looked at the rest of his channel.
00:09:16 The rest of his channel has like 2,000 views, 4,000 views, even though the video, there's
00:09:21 only a few videos, but like they're all really good.
00:09:24 And I feel like I've discovered, I feel like I discovered a diamond in the rough.
00:09:27 Like I feel like I found this channel right as, it seems poised to blow up.
00:09:33 It seems like it's good stuff and it could blow up.
00:09:35 And I feel like I found it like before.
00:09:37 For that Wario thing, I just didn't click on it because I'm like, eh, everybody makes
00:09:41 videos about stuff these days.
00:09:45 It's really good.
00:09:47 I need to watch that video because I've been needing long videos to watch that are good.
00:09:53 I tried watching the Riku was gay video and I just, it was too rambly and I didn't like
00:09:59 the person's voice.
00:10:00 Oh, me too.
00:10:01 I'm so glad.
00:10:02 I didn't have to be the one to say it.
00:10:04 You're so homophobic.
00:10:07 I am homophobic.
00:10:09 Hey, people who have bad arguments against the video, stop right now.
00:10:14 It's like, I don't like that.
00:10:16 Start with your strong arguments and then address the strong counter arguments and then address
00:10:22 the weak counter arguments.
00:10:23 They were doing it backwards.
00:10:25 I can't really complain because my Mega Man video starts with like way too much introduction.
00:10:31 Like I ramble way too much at the beginning of that video.
00:10:34 So I'm guilty of it.
00:10:36 But your video needed to be eight hours long, Ben.
00:10:39 That, okay, okay.
00:10:41 The Riku video, I think like the arguments, like the content is good and the evidence
00:10:48 is there and there's a compelling case and I am fully convinced that there is a compelling
00:10:52 case that, yeah, Riku is gay.
00:10:54 Same.
00:10:55 I'm kind of interested to hear if there's like a counter argument, like if someone
00:10:58 else has like, well, actually here's all this evidence that points to Riku isn't gay.
00:11:04 Kairi is the real love interest.
00:11:06 I'd be interested to hear a counter argument, but place side by side all the clips of Riku
00:11:15 not being interested in women and being in Tessora like are pretty compelling, right?
00:11:22 The second I heard like, oh, what if Riku's gay, I'm like, hmm, has he ever known of a
00:11:26 touch of a woman?
00:11:27 No.
00:11:28 And he never would.
00:11:29 It's just obvious.
00:11:30 It's obvious.
00:11:31 It's fun that it's not like, oh, it's a silly Japanese game and you can read that into it
00:11:39 because haha, it's like translation and it's like different culture or whatever.
00:11:44 It's like explicit from interviews of the, you know, the intent is more clear than you
00:11:53 would assume.
00:11:54 And it's interesting.
00:11:55 It kind of seems that way, even though like the initial setup when you start the game,
00:12:00 it seems like it's a love triangle where these two boys both like the girl.
00:12:06 That's what it sort of presents itself as immediately, but then like it never, it never
00:12:12 again really backs that up ever.
00:12:16 It's interesting.
00:12:18 If you got to the end of the video, I think in the description, I actually didn't get
00:12:22 all the way.
00:12:23 I got like three quarters the way through it.
00:12:24 Well, the thing I mentioned about the sleeping realm theory, the theory that's like about
00:12:30 Kingdom Hearts 3, I forget the broad strokes, but it was also interesting.
00:12:38 That's at the top of the description of the Rikus game video.
00:12:41 Check that out.
00:12:42 It's even harder to listen to.
00:12:44 So you may have more difficulty with it, but like there's a Google Doc and it's just,
00:12:52 it's great.
00:12:53 I don't know how to explain it because I'm not the one who made the video, but I like
00:12:57 it.
00:12:58 Maybe I will.
00:12:59 I like all that Kingdom Hearts stuff because it's so, the games are so cryptic in like
00:13:06 a stupid way, but well, I say it's stupid.
00:13:11 It's cryptic in, you know, deliberately cryptic way, and it's like weird how much, how many
00:13:19 things go into the presentation of these ideas that make them subtle and like hard to see,
00:13:25 but they're clearly deliberate.
00:13:28 Even things like, oh, a cutscene shows this shot and then this shot, and this is like,
00:13:33 you can infer from the choice of shots, a theme based on this other information and
00:13:39 stuff.
00:13:40 It's like, why would they, like, obviously everything in a game is created like deliberately.
00:13:46 Everything is put there deliberately, but like, you would assume some things are just
00:13:50 arbitrary, just like, oh, let's just put it wherever.
00:13:54 The fact that the theory goes into like, actually, there's a lot more hidden meaning throughout
00:14:00 the game that you wouldn't really think of, but when you, you know, it's a good theory.
00:14:07 It's a good compelling theory.
00:14:08 It's just like the Riku video.
00:14:10 Wait, I thought you were talking about the Riku video.
00:14:13 Well, I'm talking about, that's the thing.
00:14:15 It's like, it's the similar sort of thing.
00:14:17 It's a theory specifically about the nature of Kingdom Hearts 3.
00:14:22 And Riku is gay isn't necessarily related, but the Riku is gay video is like, it has
00:14:29 elements of that theory near the end.
00:14:32 If you didn't get to the end, you probably wouldn't have seen all that, but like, it's
00:14:36 good.
00:14:37 Yeah.
00:14:38 I could, I had gripes, I had gripes with the presenter.
00:14:45 I kind of didn't like them.
00:14:47 I would assume you would, but like, that's just because you're bigoted or something.
00:14:52 That's right.
00:14:53 That's right.
00:14:54 Listen, I'm going to, I didn't like, didn't like the, didn't like the fursona, didn't
00:14:59 like the avatar, thought it was underanimated, but over expressive in a way that was distracting.
00:15:06 Didn't, yeah, didn't like, they, they, they rambled.
00:15:10 They kind of, they kind of went on tangents about, I didn't like, okay, when they talked
00:15:15 about like a lack of gay representation, I found it almost like infuriatingly naive,
00:15:22 the way they talked about like Disney, I don't know, the sense that I got was like, like
00:15:26 they were, they wanted to do Disney apologia.
00:15:29 Like they wanted to be like, oh, Disney just wasn't ready.
00:15:31 Disney wasn't ready to put gay people in their movies, but now it's 2023 and now, you know,
00:15:37 times have changed.
00:15:38 And it just seemed like they weren't acknowledging the fact that like Disney does, makes these
00:15:44 decisions about like, they do this bare bones representation thing, you know, for like a
00:15:49 cold calculated money making purposes.
00:15:54 He seemed like he was absolving them of, of their responsibility in this arena.
00:15:58 And finally, the one thing about the attitude that I kind of annoyed me, and I don't know
00:16:03 if this is going to sound stupid, I feel like people might think, call me stupid for this.
00:16:07 But the way that he talked about when Riku was gay, he would always like have a little
00:16:12 sly expression, so like, hey, Riku did something gay, Riku acted gay.
00:16:16 And it felt dirty.
00:16:18 It made, it gave me a feeling like it was like a dirty secret that was being like sneakily
00:16:23 shared with me.
00:16:24 And it made it sound like being gay was like this, this dirty thing.
00:16:28 The way that he, the way that he like snickered about it every time that it, that it reared
00:16:33 its ugly head.
00:16:34 I think that's just like Tumblr culture.
00:16:37 I don't like it.
00:16:39 It's the, it's the sort of like, ooh, look at that con, look at that con and it made
00:16:44 him squee and, and he was going to glomp Riku.
00:16:46 He was going to glomp him.
00:16:48 Yeah.
00:16:49 Because he's such a little squishmallow.
00:16:50 Yeah, yeah.
00:16:51 Squishmallow.
00:16:52 And I just, I just.
00:16:53 Oh, I like that word.
00:16:55 I just can't, I just can't, I just can't cotton, cotton to it.
00:17:00 It's not, it's not copacetic.
00:17:01 I don't know.
00:17:02 Okay.
00:17:03 Okay.
00:17:04 I'm done.
00:17:05 I'm, I'm, I'm coping.
00:17:06 I'm done coping.
00:17:07 Done coping.
00:17:09 You guys, you guys haven't asked.
00:17:11 The argument was compelling.
00:17:12 You guys didn't ask me what my opinion was on the Riku.
00:17:15 Did you watch the video?
00:17:16 It was a gay video.
00:17:17 Die.
00:17:18 I didn't watch the video, but it did make, I did make this epic meme right now that expresses
00:17:24 my feelings on the video that I didn't watch.
00:17:27 Check it out.
00:17:28 I'm going to kill you.
00:17:29 What's it?
00:17:30 Yo.
00:17:31 True.
00:17:32 It's the first time I've seen an old kingdom of hearts characters R.K.
00:17:35 Um, yeah.
00:17:36 Yeah.
00:17:37 I thought they were all the gay one.
00:17:39 I thought they were all the, they don't, well, they are.
00:17:42 I mean, you could, you could scratch that to all like Final Fantasy adjacent characters
00:17:46 too.
00:17:47 I mean, those black robes.
00:17:48 Especially the white robes.
00:17:49 You don't need, you don't need eight hours to tell me Riku is gay.
00:17:52 I assume they all were gay.
00:17:53 I don't need an eight hour video.
00:17:55 I, I even big brain.
00:17:56 I already, I assume organizations are gay by default.
00:18:00 Sephiroth, Sephiroth is gay for his mom because he like is his mom.
00:18:04 That's the only gay that's okay.
00:18:05 If you think about it.
00:18:07 Yeah.
00:18:08 Which means his mom is a, is a, is a man at that point.
00:18:13 Definitely.
00:18:14 Yeah.
00:18:15 Definitely.
00:18:16 That's what I'm saying.
00:18:17 Allyship.
00:18:18 And that's, and that's where I draw the line.
00:18:19 Franklin.
00:18:20 That's where I fucking draw the line.
00:18:21 The fucking, the fucking organization 13, like their black robes, they always had a
00:18:26 bit of like, like, uh, what's the, leave it to, SMM culture, the, the leather and the
00:18:33 zips.
00:18:35 The, the, the, instead of just being made a cloth, you know, like a Jedi robe.
00:18:40 That's just got punk.
00:18:41 All, all goth punk stuff is very like SMM.
00:18:44 Yeah.
00:18:45 It's inspired.
00:18:46 It's derived from queer spaces and all that stuff.
00:18:49 True.
00:18:50 It's great.
00:18:51 Goth.
00:18:52 Shit.
00:18:53 There's no such thing as, uh, straight fashion.
00:18:56 All the cool shit is gay.
00:18:57 Straight people.
00:18:58 There's no such thing as white culture and no such thing as straight fashion.
00:19:01 It's true.
00:19:02 I agree.
00:19:03 True.
00:19:04 You know what?
00:19:06 Actually disagree.
00:19:08 Straight.
00:19:09 Straight.
00:19:10 Straight fashion is like a graphic tee with a Batman logo.
00:19:13 That's straight fashion.
00:19:14 Yeah.
00:19:15 I see your eyes.
00:19:16 Oh, you know what?
00:19:17 You've turned me around.
00:19:18 That's a great.
00:19:19 Straight, straight fashion is a guy in like an old, an old, like black and white movie
00:19:26 like prison uniform, like black and white stripes with a little like cap.
00:19:31 That's it.
00:19:32 Straight fashion.
00:19:33 No, that's a twink uniform.
00:19:35 That's the, that's the Hamburgler uniform.
00:19:37 Like, like, like what the three stooge, like what the three stooge's would wear if you
00:19:41 if you sent them to prison.
00:19:45 Just them though.
00:19:46 They only wanted to wear that if they got arrested.
00:19:49 Everyone else is dressed normal.
00:19:50 Everyone dressed in prison orange, but they get the stripes because they're just wacky.
00:19:53 They're just wacky like that.
00:19:54 Yeah.
00:19:55 If you're wacky enough, you're in prison.
00:19:56 You get the funny costume.
00:19:58 That's what that's what they put on the Joker.
00:20:01 The way I'm wearing the stripes because he's so wacky, you know, watch out.
00:20:04 This one's the wacky inmate.
00:20:06 To the Joker.
00:20:07 He's kooky.
00:20:08 He's loco.
00:20:09 Black is the new orange.
00:20:10 Oh my God.
00:20:11 And then he eats it like an orange.
00:20:14 He peels it and he makes juice out of it.
00:20:17 I don't want to.
00:20:18 That's how wacky he is.
00:20:19 Stripes on a white shirt.
00:20:20 I want to white stripes on a black shirt.
00:20:23 I remember what he said that.
00:20:27 Yeah.
00:20:28 And then Batman's like, Batman's like, you're out of line Joker.
00:20:30 He starts breaking his arms.
00:20:33 He remember when I remember when I discovered putting bacon grease on on green lentils.
00:20:39 Remember that?
00:20:40 Yeah.
00:20:41 That magical moment that we shared.
00:20:44 I found a new way to do it.
00:20:46 Put lentils on bacon grease.
00:20:48 You can put lentil grease on bacon because to get bacon grease, you have to make bacon
00:20:52 and then you have to save the grease and it's kind of a hassle.
00:20:55 But guess what?
00:20:56 You can just take bacon when you make when you make your green lentils in your rice cooker.
00:21:00 You can just take bacon and cut it up and just throw the raw bacon in the water with
00:21:06 the lentils and then the bacon cooks in the lentils.
00:21:11 The rice cooker cooks the bacon.
00:21:12 It's a miracle.
00:21:13 Ben, the year is 2020 free.
00:21:15 You said this last week your dementia is setting in.
00:21:17 Wait, I did?
00:21:18 No, you didn't.
00:21:19 Yes, you did.
00:21:20 I was waiting for you to say throwing in the bacon with the lentils and the rice cooker.
00:21:23 I'm going to kill myself.
00:21:24 I'm going to fucking do it.
00:21:25 I don't remember.
00:21:26 Maybe I just wasn't listening.
00:21:27 I don't remember you saying you put bacon in the rice cooker.
00:21:30 Oh my God.
00:21:31 Bye.
00:21:32 No, you definitely said that on the last episode.
00:21:33 I listened to it yesterday.
00:21:35 It's over.
00:21:36 I caught up to it yesterday.
00:21:37 Oh, no.
00:21:38 It's fucking over.
00:21:39 That both means that you have to mention I am completely absent-minded and I wasn't
00:21:45 listening and I was very rude if that's the case.
00:21:49 No.
00:21:50 It was like a free hour conversation.
00:21:51 I'm going to miss one or two things.
00:21:53 I can't live with myself.
00:21:57 I actually just listened to the last episode right before jumping into this one and I totally
00:22:01 forget.
00:22:02 Do you remember?
00:22:03 I forgot everything.
00:22:04 Do you remember my bacon story?
00:22:05 I forgot everything you guys talked about in the last episode.
00:22:06 Bacon and the lentils.
00:22:07 I mean, so did I.
00:22:10 Bacon and lentils.
00:22:11 The lentils.
00:22:12 The rice cooker.
00:22:13 The rice cooker cooks the bacon.
00:22:14 The rice cooker cooks the bacon.
00:22:15 It's just.
00:22:16 It's so convenient.
00:22:17 Why don't they call it a bacon cooker?
00:22:18 Why don't they call it exactly?
00:22:20 Exactly.
00:22:21 You're exactly right.
00:22:22 What if you make rice out of bacon?
00:22:23 Bacon.
00:22:24 Then it would be epic.
00:22:25 I don't know.
00:22:27 I don't know what would happen if you did that.
00:22:29 Did you chop like bacon into rice shakes?
00:22:33 Wait a second.
00:22:34 Ben, you don't have a grease jug?
00:22:37 You don't have a grease jug in your kitchen?
00:22:39 I have a Thai small mason jug, a small little glass jar.
00:22:43 No.
00:22:44 You're going to go and get yourself a big ass jug of oil, get an oil jug, and then you
00:22:50 just put that oil back in the jug and any extra oil you just put in there.
00:22:54 You just drink the oil straight from the jug.
00:22:56 Yeah.
00:22:57 I have an oil jug.
00:22:58 You don't have an oil jug?
00:23:01 Come on, Ben.
00:23:02 I have an oil jug.
00:23:03 It's called.
00:23:04 My penis.
00:23:05 Cotton balls.
00:23:06 Oh, God.
00:23:07 Check out this video.
00:23:08 Check out this video that I posted.
00:23:09 This is another one from GNO7.
00:23:12 This video.
00:23:13 It's OK.
00:23:14 Did you see that defunct land?
00:23:16 Not defunct land.
00:23:18 Where he finds the...
00:23:19 That is defunct land.
00:23:21 Yeah, I watched that.
00:23:23 That was good.
00:23:24 That was a good video.
00:23:25 Incredible video.
00:23:26 That video is basically like that.
00:23:29 But it's about this one guy who worked at Cartoon Network and is responsible for all
00:23:36 the iconic sounds of that era of Cartoon Network.
00:23:39 That's great.
00:23:40 It's such a good video.
00:23:41 Is he the one that put out...
00:23:42 I'm glad that this is really engaging and popular because it's like...
00:23:47 I mean, no, but it's only got 4,000 views, only 4,000 views on this masterpiece of a video.
00:23:55 Well, I hope it gets more, but like the idea that like uncovering the hidden talents behind
00:24:01 things that we just take for granted, it's like, yeah, they do deserve credit.
00:24:05 We do need to do that more.
00:24:08 People don't deserve to be buried alive.
00:24:10 OK.
00:24:11 It's my...
00:24:12 Like that guy who makes all the good voice mails.
00:24:14 Who is he?
00:24:15 It's not...
00:24:16 Oh my gosh.
00:24:17 Oh my gosh.
00:24:18 I'm going to kill you.
00:24:19 I'm going to kill you.
00:24:20 It's not quite as good as the defunct land one because it's not like it's a mystery.
00:24:23 Like this guy is...
00:24:24 This guy, he's not like famous, but like he is known in the industry, like people know
00:24:27 who he is.
00:24:28 So it's not like he had to search for him.
00:24:29 It's just kind of like a piece about this guy who sort of did all this amazing work
00:24:35 and you probably never heard of him.
00:24:37 But I like the content online is being made about stuff like that because like, I wouldn't
00:24:43 think to look up who made the guitar sound.
00:24:48 In fact, I want to know that.
00:24:51 You know that classic Hanna-Barbera era like guitar smash?
00:24:55 Yeah.
00:24:56 Ding!
00:24:57 I guess so.
00:24:59 Yeah.
00:25:00 Well, all sorts of cool stuff.
00:25:03 Sounds are very often overlooked.
00:25:05 True.
00:25:06 Overlooked and undercooked.
00:25:07 Sounds are of a sort of texture.
00:25:10 Sounds...
00:25:11 You were talking about...
00:25:12 Yeah, sounds can't be overlooked.
00:25:13 You can't look at a sound.
00:25:15 Stupid.
00:25:16 No, you can't.
00:25:17 You can look at the waveform.
00:25:19 No.
00:25:20 Overheard.
00:25:21 Shut up.
00:25:22 That's not true.
00:25:23 That's not true at all.
00:25:24 Shut up.
00:25:25 Yeah.
00:25:26 So, Ben, you're talking about channels that you just know are going to blow up the moment
00:25:29 you see them.
00:25:30 I had that experience a while back with this channel, Kid Leave Stoop.
00:25:34 I've heard of this.
00:25:36 This was like the first second.
00:25:37 Possibly from you.
00:25:38 I don't know if I ever mentioned it.
00:25:41 Maybe not.
00:25:42 Actually, I feel like I've...
00:25:43 2.5 million views?
00:25:44 I remember watching this one.
00:25:45 Yeah.
00:25:46 It's blown up now because it's been like over a year, but when I found this, it had like
00:25:50 less than 10,000 views and it was just really like a well-made video and I'm like, this
00:25:54 guy is going to get big and I guess he did.
00:25:57 Yeah.
00:25:58 137.
00:25:59 137.
00:26:00 Yeah.
00:26:01 I think Geno7's got the sauce.
00:26:04 I think from what you're saying, it definitely sounds like he's got the sauce.
00:26:08 Yeah.
00:26:09 Yeah.
00:26:10 That's my prescription.
00:26:12 The next video in the channel is what if bowling stayed illegal?
00:26:15 What?
00:26:16 That's what it says.
00:26:19 What if bowling stayed illegal?
00:26:20 What if bold people stayed illegal?
00:26:22 In the description?
00:26:23 No, the next video in the channel.
00:26:26 That's the title.
00:26:27 Of Kid Leaves Soup?
00:26:29 Yeah.
00:26:30 Yeah.
00:26:31 What if bowling stayed illegal?
00:26:32 It's a video.
00:26:33 Oh, wait a minute.
00:26:34 I saw this Simpsons Missing Bus Stop video.
00:26:36 Oh.
00:26:37 I've seen that one.
00:26:38 That was good too.
00:26:39 Oh, yes.
00:26:40 I did see that.
00:26:42 I haven't seen a good...
00:26:43 You know what?
00:26:44 I like videos.
00:26:45 What would you call these?
00:26:46 Bowling stayed illegal.
00:26:47 What the fuck does it mean?
00:26:48 Are these still video essays or what do you even call these types of videos?
00:26:53 Are these still video essays or...?
00:26:55 Bowling was associated with gambling or other shit, and in America it was banned.
00:27:00 Nine-pin bowling was banned, and the way they got around the law was to create 10-pin bowling.
00:27:04 It's technically a different game.
00:27:06 That's why it's ten-pin bowling.
00:27:09 I'm not joking.
00:27:10 No, I did not.
00:27:11 I never heard that before.
00:27:12 That's like cocaine's illegal, so we invented cocaine too, which is technically another
00:27:16 drug.
00:27:17 Well, no, it's just...
00:27:18 Actually, that's like...
00:27:19 That's like painkillers, actually, I think.
00:27:20 This guy has the Simpsons in like half of his video thumbnails, but it's just like that
00:27:24 episode of The Simpsons where they put uranium in the farm, in the crops, and they combine
00:27:30 tobacco and tomatoes to make tobacco.
00:27:34 It's technically a different vegetable, even though it's just...
00:27:36 Was it uranium or was it that he just was mixing seeds?
00:27:39 I thought he was just mixing seeds.
00:27:41 No, he got some stuff from the power plant and put uranium or plutonium or something
00:27:46 in the seeds.
00:27:47 Oh boy.
00:27:48 And it could cause a crossbreed.
00:27:50 I haven't seen a good video, I say, in a while.
00:27:53 The last one I watched wasn't really that good.
00:27:56 It was called Why Nintendo is so overprotective of its intellectual property.
00:28:03 That seems...
00:28:04 Because if you know nothing about Nintendo history, it's a super interesting video, but
00:28:10 after I was done watching it, he says that like, oh, the reason why it's because they
00:28:14 have this one lawsuit where Universal Studios wanted to sue them for using the word Kong,
00:28:19 but they didn't own the rights to it and that kind of scared them off.
00:28:21 That's why they didn't really merchandise or spread themselves thin.
00:28:25 And then after I was done watching the video, I was thinking like, wait a second, what about
00:28:28 the Super Mario Bros. Super Show era, where they were putting everything on macaroni in
00:28:33 the live action movie?
00:28:34 He did not mention that era at all.
00:28:38 He skipped over it.
00:28:39 And I'm like, wow, I mean, I would have argued that it wasn't even necessarily that lawsuit
00:28:44 that did it.
00:28:45 I do think it was probably just the live action movie that really scared them off from like...
00:28:50 Did you see the trailer for the new Mario movie?
00:28:52 The little promo that they had?
00:28:55 Yeah.
00:28:56 Yeah, it looks really...
00:28:57 It looks really cute.
00:28:58 A little advertisement.
00:28:59 Yeah, it looks really cute.
00:29:00 I am...
00:29:01 I'm not gonna lie.
00:29:02 I like...
00:29:03 I'm gonna watch it, but like a part of me feels like, God, I wish I was like 12 years
00:29:07 old, because I'd be more excited about this, because I feel like I'm not that excited for
00:29:13 it.
00:29:14 Even though it seems like this would be something I would want, and it looks like they're stretching
00:29:18 beyond and doing more kind of lore stuff, like they even have like the whole Kong race
00:29:23 there and everything.
00:29:24 And I would have ate that shit up as a kid, but like...
00:29:27 Yeah.
00:29:28 Now I'm kind of like...
00:29:29 Like, I don't know.
00:29:30 I don't know.
00:29:31 It's like...
00:29:32 It's...
00:29:33 I mean, I'm gonna watch it.
00:29:34 I'll probably like it, but I'm not...
00:29:35 I don't feel that excited about it.
00:29:36 I just...
00:29:37 I don't know.
00:29:38 I guess I moved on.
00:29:39 You know?
00:29:40 I never...
00:29:41 There's...
00:29:42 I didn't...
00:29:43 Care for Mario in the first place, so I'm just interested.
00:29:45 I didn't really care about the movie at all.
00:29:48 I thought it was gonna, like, whatever, but I gotta say, seeing that new trailer, there's
00:29:53 something that warms my heart a little bit about the fact that they're sticking to the
00:29:57 old, like, their plumbers from Brooklyn, like, backstory.
00:30:00 I...
00:30:01 I love the live-action movie.
00:30:02 I...
00:30:03 I get the more I love that.
00:30:04 Yeah.
00:30:05 Like, live-action movie.
00:30:06 It's great.
00:30:07 I genuinely love the live-action movie as a kid.
00:30:10 Like, I watched it a bunch of times.
00:30:11 I'll tell you...
00:30:12 I'll tell you this.
00:30:14 Something about, like, it feels like the Mario movie is being made by people who are, like,
00:30:19 fans of Mario, and not gonna lie.
00:30:23 I feel like...
00:30:24 Cause there's, like, a big, like, group of people who love, like, those last two live-action
00:30:28 Sonic movies, and, like, like, everyone I know who loves it is not gonna listen to
00:30:33 this podcast.
00:30:34 So, I could say this.
00:30:36 I feel like it was a big cope.
00:30:38 I feel like liking those movies was, like, a massive cope.
00:30:42 Because they're just unironically, like, what if Alvin from Alvin and Chipmunks was a superhero?
00:30:47 It's, like, what the Sonic movies are.
00:30:49 And I'm tired of pretending they're not.
00:30:51 I'm tired of pretending they're not that.
00:30:53 Cause it's...
00:30:54 It's really...
00:30:55 It doesn't...
00:30:56 It wouldn't even fucking...
00:30:57 It wouldn't even fucking matter.
00:30:58 I'll...
00:30:59 I'll be honest.
00:31:00 What?
00:31:01 It wouldn't even...
00:31:02 It wouldn't fucking matter.
00:31:03 It wouldn't fucking matter.
00:31:04 I'll tell you this.
00:31:05 He wouldn't do anything.
00:31:06 I'll tell you this.
00:31:07 If they removed Sonic from that movie...
00:31:08 Like, if they removed everything, like, that was Sonic the Hedgehog related, I wouldn't
00:31:12 even be able to tell that it was supposed to be a Sonic movie to begin with.
00:31:17 Hmm.
00:31:18 Oh my gosh.
00:31:19 If you take everything Sonic related out of something, you wouldn't know it was Sonic
00:31:22 the Hedgehog.
00:31:23 No, no, no.
00:31:24 Not like that.
00:31:25 Like, because it's certain...
00:31:26 Like, Sonic stories have, like, a certain way about, you know.
00:31:28 Like, like...
00:31:29 Oh.
00:31:30 Here's how...
00:31:31 You're saying the movie didn't feel Sonic.
00:31:33 No, it didn't really...
00:31:34 Didn't feel...
00:31:35 I mean, the fact that, like, we have, like, kind of like a human character that we're
00:31:39 following...
00:31:40 I mean...
00:31:41 Like, like an oven in the chipmunks.
00:31:44 This guy is just Dave.
00:31:45 This guy is just Dave from oven in the chipmunks.
00:31:47 Everything wrong with the Sonic movie that you're describing is down to just that one
00:31:52 human character.
00:31:53 Just for one.
00:31:54 Not even all human characters.
00:31:55 I don't think so.
00:31:56 Even like, the one dad guy.
00:31:57 No, it is down to him.
00:31:58 He has a weird hexagon-shaped face.
00:32:00 I want to punch him.
00:32:01 I hate this face.
00:32:02 Personally, I think he's handsome.
00:32:03 But, like...
00:32:04 Even, like, robot...
00:32:05 Even, like, dog...
00:32:06 Well, let's find out whether or not he's handsome.
00:32:07 He's in Doctor Eggman.
00:32:08 He looks like an NFT profile picture.
00:32:10 Like, I don't mind Jim Carrey, but, like, he does not look like...
00:32:14 Dude, I'm not sure...
00:32:15 Jim Carrey is Eggman.
00:32:16 I love Jim Carrey.
00:32:17 It's so weird.
00:32:18 Jim Carrey is Eggman looks...
00:32:19 He's good.
00:32:20 Jim Carrey is Eggman looked kind of neat.
00:32:21 I thought that looked cool.
00:32:22 I mean, I didn't see the movie.
00:32:23 I really enjoyed him as Eggman.
00:32:24 I'll tell you this.
00:32:25 If, like, if that design existed and it wasn't tied to a Sonic movie, I would never even
00:32:29 say tell that that was supposed to be Eggman.
00:32:32 Hmm.
00:32:33 Well, doesn't he look more like Eggman in the second one?
00:32:37 Doesn't he, like, become fat or whatever?
00:32:39 No, he doesn't.
00:32:40 He stays skinny.
00:32:41 He does become fat.
00:32:42 But he gets the costume.
00:32:43 Like, like, he looks more like classic Eggman.
00:32:45 He gets the must...
00:32:46 Yeah.
00:32:47 There's, like, little, like, classic Eggman-isms going for him, but it doesn't get too, like...
00:32:53 You know what?
00:32:54 I kind of think, and I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
00:32:58 about, but something about the fact that Jim Carrey kind of doesn't look anything at all
00:33:01 like Eggman, and yet, you know, from the trailers I saw, he kind of sort of was...
00:33:07 I think it's like a weird outside the box.
00:33:09 I would say it's a weird outside the box, maybe even inspired casting choice that I would
00:33:16 never have thought of.
00:33:17 Like, I'm a...
00:33:18 I like it.
00:33:19 I think I like it.
00:33:20 I enjoy it.
00:33:21 I'm entertained.
00:33:22 And in interviews, Jim Carrey was like, I really, really hope that in the next movie
00:33:26 they let me be fat.
00:33:27 He said, I mean, I'll tell you this, I mean, I thought the second movie was better than
00:33:32 the first one, but the first one wasn't even, like, a high bar, so it was like...
00:33:37 It went from, like, eh, to, all right, for me.
00:33:41 You know, I just want to have fun with these movies.
00:33:43 I'm not expecting them to be, like, good films, just want to have fun.
00:33:46 They've been fun.
00:33:47 I'm just trying to have fun with your wife.
00:33:51 Too bad.
00:33:53 Oh, yeah.
00:33:54 Okay.
00:33:55 She's your gay now, huh?
00:33:56 She's your gay.
00:33:57 Who was I coming into last night?
00:33:59 Boom.
00:34:00 Got him.
00:34:01 Dead.
00:34:02 You're almost as gay as Riku.
00:34:03 I would say.
00:34:04 I didn't say, I didn't say I wasn't, I didn't say I wasn't also a Kingdom Hearts character.
00:34:09 I, when I saw they would cast, what's this, Jim Carrey's Eggman, I was like, what the
00:34:15 fuck?
00:34:16 Weird.
00:34:17 Interesting.
00:34:18 Neat.
00:34:19 When I saw that they cast Jack Black as Bowser, I thought, neat.
00:34:23 And then I heard him, and I was like, oh, you know what?
00:34:26 It is Jack Black, but it kind of sounds, it just kind of sounds normal, kind of just sounds
00:34:32 like Bowser.
00:34:33 Honestly, it's not.
00:34:34 When they said?
00:34:35 It's not that weird.
00:34:36 It's not that weird of a voice.
00:34:37 When they said Jack Black Bowser, I thought, oh, perfect.
00:34:40 That just works for me.
00:34:41 If you, if you're...
00:34:42 Yeah, it just works.
00:34:43 It just works, but it doesn't really, it's not really interesting.
00:34:45 I don't know.
00:34:46 I think Jim Carrey as Eggman is interesting.
00:34:47 I'll tell you this.
00:34:48 I'm pretty like, you know what, ultimately, I feel like if you like Sonic, you like those
00:34:52 Sonic movies, and I kind of relate in the way that, like, if you notice, a lot of DC
00:35:00 movies have very kind of like, interesting like casting choices, and I think the biggest
00:35:06 example would be like Arnold Schwarzenegger as like Mr. Freeze, right?
00:35:11 And like, oh, I love that.
00:35:12 That.
00:35:13 I love that they went in that turn.
00:35:14 Okay, okay.
00:35:15 And with that, I mean, that was like, because Arnold was like the biggest star of the freaking
00:35:19 era.
00:35:20 No, but like, if, but think a bit like this, Mr. Freeze, whereas Jim, Jim Carrey is not
00:35:24 exactly like an A-lister anymore.
00:35:26 You know what's so funny is that that version of Mr. Freeze was created because the, that
00:35:32 first Tim Burton Batman movie came out, and in the, in the show, in that episode, Heart
00:35:38 of Ice, which is like a 10 out of 10 episode, I watched it like three times last month in
00:35:42 a row.
00:35:44 Mr. Freeze isn't like a bodybuilder Austrian guy.
00:35:48 He's like a little, little fucking little cancer nerd in a super suit, you know, in, in, in
00:35:54 which, in the animated series, yeah, animated series.
00:35:58 Yeah.
00:35:59 Right.
00:36:00 So it's like, oh, to choose a bodybuilder to play that character is a very out there choice,
00:36:04 you know.
00:36:05 Yeah.
00:36:06 Well, I mean, it's a different, okay.
00:36:08 Mr. Freeze is from the animated series.
00:36:12 Like he was made for.
00:36:13 He is.
00:36:14 Not from an older.
00:36:15 He existed, but he was more of a goofier character called like Mr. Zero.
00:36:19 And then in the animated series, they're all like, Hey, what if we just reboot his old
00:36:23 origin story?
00:36:24 Let's, let's literally rip off the movie, the abominable, the abominable Doctor Fibes,
00:36:29 which has the whole origin with the wife.
00:36:32 And like, let's give that to Mr. Freeze.
00:36:34 And the re, and if you ever, if you rewatch that episode, I really recommend you rewatch
00:36:38 Heart of Ice because that's a real, that's still a really good episode.
00:36:42 Mr. Freeze has like this little, his voice does like, it sounds like it sounds mechanical
00:36:46 because it's coming out of like a speaker and they, and that's like lifted directly
00:36:50 from the movie, the abominable Doctor Fibes, because that character, that character connects
00:36:57 like a speaker into his fro and he, and he talks out of like a fucking like phonograph
00:37:02 and it, and it sounds like that.
00:37:03 Yeah.
00:37:04 Like one of those things that like people that had to get their tracheas removed because
00:37:08 they got throat cancer, like when they put the microphone to their throat.
00:37:11 It's like the movie was made, like, I think in the 60s.
00:37:14 So it's like a, it's like a speaker.
00:37:16 It's like a fucking, it's those old timey, like the fucking open bloom flower looking
00:37:20 speakers that that's like connected to a record player.
00:37:23 Yeah, yeah, that movie is great, too.
00:37:25 That movie is like, imagine if it's like it saw, but like if the Jigsaw killer was
00:37:32 like a goofy super villain who was played by Vincent Price, if anyone knows Vincent
00:37:37 Price, the 10 out of 10.
00:37:39 Of course, of course, I know Vincent Price.
00:37:42 Well, come on.
00:37:43 He's a classic boy.
00:37:44 Well, well, I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think.
00:37:49 Was OK.
00:37:51 So it casting Jim Carrey as Eggman is like, OK, we need we have a goofy villain from
00:37:57 a well-known franchise and we're so we're going to and we're going to cast this sort
00:38:02 of like comedian, this like this well-known comedian, but who's like like past his prime.
00:38:06 Like he's not really a big movie star anymore, even though everybody knows who he is.
00:38:10 Is that kind of what they were doing with Arnold in ice?
00:38:13 Like was Arnold kind of already sort of like an old star and they were like,
00:38:17 let's bring Arnold back for this fucking weird like superhero role.
00:38:21 I can't remember if like Batman and Robin was one of the last films.
00:38:26 Because if I remember correctly, Arnold didn't really bring that much to like the
00:38:30 Mr. Freeze, like Mr. Freeze is not like a very he didn't really act a lot.
00:38:35 Well, he kind of delivers like ice puns.
00:38:38 I mean, he yeah, he like he, you know, he acted as much as Arnold can act, you know.
00:38:43 Right. Right.
00:38:44 And the ice puns is all part of the charm, which is very funny how like
00:38:52 the the original character of Mr.
00:38:55 Freeze was like a very goofy like his original suit was like yellow and pink
00:38:59 and he had more like a bubble helmet.
00:39:02 And yeah.
00:39:03 And then they make them all super serious in the Batman animated series.
00:39:06 And then they make him goofy again in the live action.
00:39:09 Yeah, they take they take the new serious backstory,
00:39:12 but they make him ridiculous again by cat by making him Arnold in hard advice.
00:39:16 Isn't there a part where like he's a he's a doctor and someone calls him
00:39:20 like Doctor Freeze and he says, actually, it's Mr.
00:39:23 Isn't there? Yeah, yeah, there's this.
00:39:25 Yes, there is a part like that. That's that's a fucking that's I'm sorry.
00:39:29 There's this really good bit in that episode
00:39:33 where I'm and I it's in like I'm looking for right now in the animated
00:39:37 gifts, but there's like a bit where like and I was listening to the director's
00:39:41 commentary of that episode where it's like so Mr.
00:39:44 Freeze is trying to kill the guy who like, you know, is the reason why he's in
00:39:48 that fucking suit, right?
00:39:49 And they're they're attacking his building with his like giant freeze cannon
00:39:54 and Batman stops the cannon and Mr.
00:39:56 Freeze with his cannon already kind of like froze the door shut to the building
00:40:00 so he can't get in and and I was looking to the director's commentary
00:40:03 and they thought like, oh, how do we heat Mr.
00:40:05 Freeze has to be inside that building for the for like the ending of the episode.
00:40:08 So how do we get him inside that building?
00:40:10 And they think of this very clever bit where it's like, OK, what he's going to do
00:40:14 is going to walk up to a fire hydrant and the fire hydrant is going to like kick
00:40:18 it, it's going to it's going to break open, right?
00:40:19 And then water is going to spray out and then Mr.
00:40:21 Freeze is going to like push his gun into the water stream
00:40:25 and turn it on and that upstream will freeze like the water.
00:40:29 But the like the frozen ice would push Mr.
00:40:32 Freeze upward and it's kind of hard to describe.
00:40:34 But when you see it in action, like here's what it looks like.
00:40:37 And it's like really fucking clever, like way to get him inside the building.
00:40:42 You see what you see what I mean?
00:40:43 Let's see here. All right, I'm watching.
00:40:46 There he goes. Yeah.
00:40:48 Yeah, I mean, it makes sense. Yeah, it's it's really it's really dope.
00:40:52 Like fuck, I miss listening to directors commentary.
00:40:56 This is I think it would honestly, I think it would make a little more sense
00:41:00 as if he just kind of jumped on top of the water and just froze a little bit of it.
00:41:04 And then the water pressure might just push the little ice platform,
00:41:07 like I rocket it up, I guess. I don't know.
00:41:11 I don't I don't know. I get it.
00:41:12 I think I'm I think he'll just fall down because of his suit
00:41:16 would be too heavy for a stream.
00:41:18 OK, the physical of it is kind of like. I'm sure.
00:41:21 How does how does how does a physics of us make sense for?
00:41:24 Yeah, the physics are what is the ice with the ice block.
00:41:27 It's ultimately what we stop flying.
00:41:29 Or is it like a tube?
00:41:30 It what it what it is is that it's slowly getting it's getting frozen,
00:41:34 but only like.
00:41:36 OK, what already came out.
00:41:37 So that kind of like pushes him up.
00:41:39 Here's what I think. Here's what I think.
00:41:40 The the water once it leaves the the the hydrant is in is in a free fall.
00:41:46 It's going to travel in a parabolic arc.
00:41:48 So if he freezes a chunk of it and then like holds on to it somehow,
00:41:52 you know, assuming that it has like a lot more mass than he does,
00:41:54 he's just going to be pulled along in its parabolic arc as it flies.
00:41:58 It's it's very goofy physics.
00:42:00 But as long as it kind of makes sense, it's fine.
00:42:03 I mean, this is the same universe where he has like a giant mechanical
00:42:05 robot suit that he's in, right?
00:42:08 And he has like a made up disease.
00:42:10 So, you know, it's fine. It's fine.
00:42:12 I get it. I'm I'm I'm the episode is based.
00:42:15 The episode is really good.
00:42:17 While watching it, I was like being I was being one of those like
00:42:21 the whole you I was being I was jerking off.
00:42:23 I was like being like they don't make them like they used to villains.
00:42:26 Don't like quote poetry anymore.
00:42:28 They don't like they don't fucking hold villains.
00:42:31 Don't hold you hostage and then like fucking like, you know,
00:42:35 do like fucking poetry around you about like, oh, woe is me.
00:42:40 Did you did did you hear that they released like a new
00:42:46 edited version of like Roald Dahl's books and like they just change.
00:42:51 Now, did you hear about they unironically did the yeah, I know what you're talking
00:42:54 about, they did the meme.
00:42:55 They should they change they changed a bunch of stuff and they genuinely
00:42:59 like put in like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
00:43:03 But they fucking they made them woke and mean that in like a weird bad way.
00:43:07 Like they took out like pretty innocuous things and like made them like
00:43:12 aggressively like inclusive.
00:43:14 They did like like what kind of a not I'll find the I'll find the example
00:43:18 that they did the thing where it's like, I'm quoting the sick animation clip.
00:43:22 But it's kind of like back in my day, it was all about Chef Boyardy.
00:43:27 Now it's now all they eat is Chef Boyard girl.
00:43:32 That's that's unironically like that's unironically like what they did.
00:43:37 And it's like, this is so why like.
00:43:39 OK, OK, OK, I found that a sick animation.
00:43:42 I still saw a sick animation made a little thing about that.
00:43:45 I don't know if he came up with it.
00:43:46 Sounds like something that I'm exactly quoting like a sick animation short
00:43:50 that he made recently. Yeah.
00:43:52 I've really been liking those shirts you've been making.
00:43:53 Those are really funny.
00:43:55 Yeah, it's just non sequitur, a little little character.
00:43:59 I wish she was my friend.
00:44:00 So here. Here's here's here's three bits that were changed.
00:44:07 I only saw the first one.
00:44:09 The first one is the one that but the other two, I guess, are similar.
00:44:13 Yeah, here. Here's some examples of changes they made to these twenty twenty two
00:44:17 editions of of a role doll.
00:44:21 Yeah, OK, the first one you let's change.
00:44:24 You can't go around pulling the hair of every lady you meet,
00:44:27 even if she is wearing gloves, just you try it and see what happens.
00:44:32 What is that?
00:44:33 Yeah, they couldn't and they couldn't.
00:44:34 They didn't want to say that.
00:44:36 Besides, they're so they changed it to besides, there are plenty of other reasons
00:44:40 why women might wear wigs and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.
00:44:44 Have that that changes the meaning of the as a like what like what?
00:44:49 As Joseph, why is that change?
00:44:50 I'm looking at the.
00:44:51 Oh, they they also change stuff from from Matilda, too.
00:44:56 I think they did.
00:44:57 Yeah, they did it to a bunch of which is so weird.
00:45:00 So the first one is like they really change to work.
00:45:03 So the was already woke.
00:45:04 I don't know why like they're doing the more female CEOs bit.
00:45:09 Why they're really girl, even if she's working as a cashier in a supermarket
00:45:13 or typing letters for a businessman, even if she is working.
00:45:16 I why? OK, I don't even under.
00:45:19 I don't even know the context of this line.
00:45:21 So I don't really guess.
00:45:23 I guess the idea is because it's like kind of reinforcing
00:45:27 like old gender norms kind of stuff.
00:45:29 And these books are so popular, they're so circulated.
00:45:32 Yeah, I'm not justifying.
00:45:34 I'm not justifying like the rewrites of it.
00:45:37 It's just ultimately you should you should still tell kids,
00:45:39 hey, by the way, those were written like when people those were written
00:45:44 before the Mormon Church decided like people were people.
00:45:48 They like like if it's talking about witches and like you can't tell
00:45:53 even if they're doing normal woman things like being a cashier
00:45:56 or typing letters for a businessman like that, I guess that's fine
00:45:59 to change because it's old fashioned.
00:46:02 The first one I'm trying to like that I don't get.
00:46:05 It's like you can't go around.
00:46:07 You can't go around pulling hair to see if they have a wig.
00:46:12 Just try and see what happens.
00:46:13 So it's saying don't do that.
00:46:16 Besides, there are plenty of other reasons why one might wear wigs.
00:46:22 Like why couldn't they like that?
00:46:24 Why can't they change?
00:46:25 They couldn't they didn't need to delete the first bit.
00:46:27 They could have just added.
00:46:29 I mean, OK, I would like if they really wanted to do that.
00:46:32 Like it's not like this is why the first one is saying wigs is a bad thing.
00:46:35 Anyway, I mean, I don't even see the need for like, oh, we got to put a line
00:46:40 in there about how it's OK to wear a wig.
00:46:42 Nothing about the first line suggests that it isn't OK for someone to wear a wig.
00:46:47 Yeah. What I was saying is don't don't mess with people who wear wigs.
00:46:52 It's already saying not to mess with people right over that.
00:46:55 Like it's it's fine.
00:46:58 Yeah, I assume these are like some of like the most baffling
00:47:02 and like pointless and irritating changes.
00:47:04 Maybe some of the other ones I might understand more because apparently they just
00:47:09 I don't know, the new additions have a bunch of I really I really hate the second one
00:47:12 because like it's it's not the fact that it's like I see where like you could
00:47:16 interpret the second one as the original being a bit problematic.
00:47:19 I don't agree with the cashier thing.
00:47:21 Everyone weighs in girls of both cashiers and always have been.
00:47:24 I don't get that.
00:47:25 But like the typing letters for a businessman, it's like,
00:47:27 oh, working under a man.
00:47:28 It's like, OK, I can see if I've been in a shoe.
00:47:29 But why can't you just say instead of running a business,
00:47:32 you could also just say working in an office because like they're describing
00:47:35 normal like average Joe jobs and being a CEO or a top scientist
00:47:40 or not average normal person jobs.
00:47:44 Maybe if I read the context, something about this would make more sense.
00:47:47 But yeah, it really seems like they changed the meaning from
00:47:50 work talking about someone just having a job to talking about someone
00:47:54 like being a big wig, a fricking for.
00:47:56 Yeah, girl boss top and like that's a different
00:47:59 that's a different scenario you're describing, especially if the context is
00:48:02 like, oh, you know, witches could be ordinary people.
00:48:05 Now it's witches could be billionaires.
00:48:07 Yeah, we were more rich billionaires.
00:48:11 Are they fucking billionaires?
00:48:13 You mean J.K. Rowling?
00:48:16 Oh, my God, goblins, the goblins.
00:48:22 I bet there were some problematic goblins in Roald Dahl's books.
00:48:25 Probably the first one is like our kind of goblins design.
00:48:29 Yeah, it's it's sort of odd because in the witches, like I can't remember
00:48:35 the book, the book itself, like the idea that witches don't have hair
00:48:39 and they wear wigs inherently is sort of like playing into
00:48:45 like this idea that not having hair is a bad thing.
00:48:48 Wearing wigs isn't is a sense of like, oh, you're kind of you could be a secret
00:48:53 secret bad person, like that's that's already into like the the reason
00:48:58 the witches are like that is so like changing just this line to say, by the
00:49:03 way, there's nothing wrong with wearing wigs, but also in this story,
00:49:07 the bad people always wear wigs.
00:49:09 Are the witches bad in the witches?
00:49:11 I have they are they eat children.
00:49:13 They're they're OK.
00:49:15 It's like a little boy, I think.
00:49:17 And he's like, I I'm just a little boy.
00:49:20 And then there's these witches.
00:49:21 Like, I will eat you.
00:49:22 There was something I do vividly remember the plot synopsis like a little
00:49:27 boy who's raised by his grandma and his grandma says, like, oh, yeah,
00:49:31 witches exist and they eat kids and they disguise themselves as regular women.
00:49:36 And I first see them believe it, but he has an encounter with like a weird
00:49:39 woman who's trying to lure her down his treehouse where he's like, look,
00:49:43 I have all these snakes.
00:49:44 And he's like, what the fuck?
00:49:45 And eventually they go to a hotel and the kid accidentally like witnesses
00:49:49 like a witch conference and then the witches find them and they turn them into
00:49:53 like a no, not witch.
00:49:55 Yeah, witch, which witch gone for the tournament to a mouse.
00:49:58 And then the kid figures out, oh, we should we should like slip the mouse juice
00:50:03 to the witches, but they all turn into mouses.
00:50:05 And then we can just all stop.
00:50:07 Definitely.
00:50:07 We can always just stomp them to death or something.
00:50:09 I don't know how they kill anyway.
00:50:11 So they do that.
00:50:12 They stomp the witches to death.
00:50:14 And then Jesus and the ending bit.
00:50:16 You know what the ending bit?
00:50:17 It's very interesting, like the direction they go because this feels kind of
00:50:20 dark for a kid's like story.
00:50:22 But the thing is so he doesn't turn back into a human.
00:50:25 He stays a mouse and they figure out that a mouse has like only like,
00:50:29 like maybe a five year or 10 year lifespan.
00:50:32 They have a short lifespan, right?
00:50:34 And the grandma says like, oh, I'm not going to live long.
00:50:36 So we're probably going to die around the same time.
00:50:37 So it's fine that you stay a mouse.
00:50:39 The end.
00:50:40 Cool.
00:50:42 Just die.
00:50:43 What?
00:50:43 Wait, wait, wait, wait, to the kid.
00:50:45 Because they can't turn him back from being a human.
00:50:47 So they assume that you're not probably live a full mouse life, which is kind of
00:50:50 short. So we're going to die around the same time.
00:50:53 I've watched the film.
00:50:54 There's a film that I remember.
00:50:56 And the film he turns back into human.
00:50:57 I don't remember if it ends differently.
00:50:59 And the film he turns back into a kid and then the book he doesn't.
00:51:02 Yeah.
00:51:03 Yeah.
00:51:04 Have you have you read the sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?
00:51:07 The The Great Glass Elevator.
00:51:09 Yeah.
00:51:10 Yeah, Charlie and the Great.
00:51:11 Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is so it's I read it as a kid.
00:51:15 And like, it's so fucked.
00:51:16 There's aliens.
00:51:17 They go to like the International Space Station and like there's aliens there.
00:51:21 And there there's a part where there's a part where
00:51:25 Wonka makes this like juice.
00:51:27 He makes this like gum that like turns you young and the grandpa parents
00:51:31 like eat so much they eat too much of it.
00:51:33 And they ate the unaged to before they were born.
00:51:36 So they have to travel to like the fucking ghostly
00:51:39 like afterlife spirit realm to like find their souls and spray them with like
00:51:43 sap from a from a from a thousand year old pine tree to like
00:51:48 re-age them back to the land of the living and it turns them old again.
00:51:52 And they're like, can I have some more so I could be young?
00:51:54 And they're like, no, you ate it all the first time.
00:51:56 No, you're just old now.
00:51:57 Sorry, you fucked up.
00:52:00 Jesus Christ.
00:52:02 It's a lot of weird, weird shit in that one.
00:52:05 Aliens, aliens are canon in in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
00:52:10 Makes sense.
00:52:11 I believe it.
00:52:12 I mean, they have Oompa Loompas.
00:52:14 Oompa Loompas were just like pygmy people, which is like a real
00:52:18 it's a real group of people that I don't I don't really I used to exist.
00:52:22 Maybe they they maybe still exist.
00:52:24 No, they're there. The problematic goblins.
00:52:26 They're like, um, you know, the real problematic is not thinking back
00:52:30 to Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
00:52:35 And like, Wonka does do it.
00:52:37 Do I'm going into the jungle and I'm stealing the people that I mean,
00:52:42 I mean, that's not Tim Burton.
00:52:43 Like that's in the original book.
00:52:45 I know, I just decided to think it.
00:52:49 I haven't read the book.
00:52:50 So I'm just thinking of the land and the Oompa's.
00:52:53 There's like all these creatures that eat them.
00:52:54 And and really, Wanker's like, yeah, it's humbling with me and my factory and work.
00:53:00 It's straight up.
00:53:01 The Oompa Loompas are a tribe from like the African jungle that are like savages
00:53:05 and they were being attacked by, yeah, freaking creatures in the wild.
00:53:09 And he was like, hey, I'll give you a factory to live in.
00:53:13 And if you just become my, sure you, we don't call it slavery.
00:53:17 You know, you can just live in my factory and work there.
00:53:19 And it's better than it's better than being eaten by Jaguars, right?
00:53:24 And they're like, yeah, I'll like, let's do it.
00:53:26 I like, thank you.
00:53:28 Thank you, White Saviour, for rescuing me from the fricking from the fricking
00:53:32 dangers of the wild. It's so funny.
00:53:34 I love it. It's so funny how like all kind of like major classic
00:53:36 like British literature, like kind of justifies colonization slightly in a way.
00:53:44 It's a major cultural exercise.
00:53:46 Even fascinating people, like even like Alan Moore, who's very like critical
00:53:50 about like the British government and as like an anarchist and like League
00:53:54 of Extraordinary Gentlemen, he forgot to read.
00:53:57 He didn't realize that like, oh, having so much of all the universe,
00:54:01 pop culture centered around British pop culture kind of like creates
00:54:06 this land of like whiteness and subtle, very so subtle,
00:54:12 like colonization, justification.
00:54:17 Luckily, though, everyone goes to space and lives forever.
00:54:20 It's easy. It's very easy to just kind of fall into that sort of thinking
00:54:24 without even realizing it when that's just the culture.
00:54:27 That's why in my Marvel Universe fanfic, the Queen dies back back
00:54:34 when the IRA put that bomb in her car.
00:54:36 It actually kills her in my alternate universe.
00:54:40 I did that happen in real life.
00:54:42 They the bomb wasn't the blast wasn't big enough to kill her.
00:54:45 And I think it was either was the wrong car or it was the blast just wasn't big enough.
00:54:51 So they like missed a chance.
00:54:53 I never got a DVD box out of the crown, so we'll never know.
00:55:02 I have.
00:55:03 Wait, where'd you go then?
00:55:04 Let's see.
00:55:05 I had to did some.
00:55:07 OK, shit.
00:55:08 I already already talked about the bacon in my lentils.
00:55:10 So that was it. That was all I had.
00:55:12 That was the only one you're going to bring it up before you go to stand up.
00:55:15 Mike, can you get your cue cards?
00:55:17 Hey, I know now hold on now, hold on.
00:55:19 I might have mentioned this already already in this episode,
00:55:23 but did I mention the bacon in my lentils?
00:55:25 Actually, OK, interesting.
00:55:29 I've been I've been doing experiments.
00:55:31 I've been doing experiments on quinine and time in my room.
00:55:36 I bought OK, I explained that I want for the to achieve a certain visual effect
00:55:41 in a in a in a video that I want to record.
00:55:44 I thought about painting my teeth with quinine.
00:55:50 To make them look weird.
00:55:52 And so to achieve this, I bought 12 liters of tonic water
00:55:58 and I boiled it down to like 100 milliliters.
00:56:02 And I have I put it under a black light and I did things to it.
00:56:08 I did I did fucked up things to it.
00:56:10 Oh, no. Here we are.
00:56:11 Here we are. So so the OK, OK, so it glows blue under the black light.
00:56:16 If you boil it down, it glows blue brighter.
00:56:19 But if you boil it down even more, it it starts to glow less
00:56:23 and it glows it glows on one side, but like the light sort of like diffuses
00:56:27 and it doesn't glow all the way through.
00:56:29 And I think the reason why is that the concentration of the other chemicals
00:56:33 in it, specifically like the aspartame or whatever,
00:56:36 because I got the non sugar kind, is like occluding the quinine molecules
00:56:40 and preventing them from fluorescing.
00:56:43 So I tried this, right, because it's acidic.
00:56:47 There's citric acid in there.
00:56:49 So I did the baking soda vinegar volcano thing
00:56:52 and I put baking soda into it to try and neutralize the acid.
00:56:56 And what happens when you do that is it creates carbon dioxide and sodium citrate.
00:57:01 And sodium citrate is a salt and an emulsifier.
00:57:03 It is what they put in cheese to turn it into American cheese.
00:57:06 So I put baking soda in the stuff and it bubbled and this is amazing.
00:57:11 I couldn't believe this.
00:57:13 The quinine glows blue.
00:57:15 But when you put the baking soda in, it turned green.
00:57:19 It now it now fluoresces green under a black light.
00:57:22 And I don't know why that is because it's still like the quinine is not in like a compound.
00:57:27 The quinine should be the same.
00:57:28 So I have no idea why it changed color, but it did.
00:57:32 I should have taken a picture.
00:57:34 I wish I had a picture to show you.
00:57:36 So like my mistake, you know, but it looks like it's like a different
00:57:39 chemical reaction or somehow the wavelength got affected.
00:57:42 I don't know.
00:57:43 I didn't think that the quinine would change form at all in doing this.
00:57:47 But like, I guess it did.
00:57:50 But visually, it looks really good because it turns it turned when I added
00:57:55 the baking soda to it, it turned not just like it's like a slightly green.
00:57:59 It's like a whitish, greenish, yellowish, like milky white pale glow.
00:58:04 And it looks it actually looks really good.
00:58:06 So it looks it looks.
00:58:08 Yeah, I'm going to.
00:58:10 I don't know.
00:58:10 I'm going to see what.
00:58:12 Smear that all over your face.
00:58:13 This is what I've been doing this week.
00:58:14 I've been like I've having all these I'm turning on the black light
00:58:17 and I'm like putting like powders into all these glowing vials and they're
00:58:20 like fizzing and boiling and like glowing at me and changing color.
00:58:23 And I'm just like, you should be recording this.
00:58:25 That'd be good.
00:58:26 I should be recording this because that's like slime experiments.
00:58:29 It'd be good.
00:58:30 Also, also the origin also Ben real quick.
00:58:33 I'm going to take a picture of the origin story of Ben Slime.
00:58:38 It would you mean the you mean the cop killer, the cop killer.
00:58:41 Who?
00:58:42 No, no, I don't fuck with that commie bullshit.
00:58:46 Give me give me one minute.
00:58:48 I'll be right back.
00:58:49 Then I can't spare one minute.
00:58:52 I can't spare one minute.
00:58:53 Oh, there's a thing I was going to bring up, but I already forgot what it was.
00:58:57 Were you going to bring up at man and the wasquantum manium now in feeders?
00:59:02 Quantum manium.
00:59:04 I love that pun.
00:59:05 I saw I saw that movie high when it like an early screening of it.
00:59:09 And the whole time I was thinking like, God, when is this going to be over?
00:59:13 What if it was Ant-Man or the wasp?
00:59:15 And like, you didn't know which movie you're going to be seeing.
00:59:18 You have to choose the gender.
00:59:19 Oh, it's like, oh, it's like Pokemon or the wasp.
00:59:22 And it's either about one or the other, but you don't know which one.
00:59:24 It's it's it's like clue.
00:59:26 It's like the movie clue when it released in theaters.
00:59:29 I had like each theater had like a different ending or they're like
00:59:33 or they're like seven different endings.
00:59:35 But like it was random which theater got what for like who the color was.
00:59:39 You know, would be a I always thought would be a pretty cool like experiment was
00:59:44 um and there was like a comic that basically had like like two comics
00:59:49 were made that were using the same script, but it was like two different
00:59:52 interpretations of the same script.
00:59:55 And like two different artists.
00:59:57 Yeah, two different artists.
00:59:58 And you could like design the characters however you want, right?
01:00:01 But it'd be like the same characters in both stories.
01:00:04 And the plot beats would be the same up until the ending.
01:00:07 Both versions would have different endings.
01:00:08 I always thought that'd be a really cool experiment and you can kind of do
01:00:11 like a Pokemon thing where you call one like red version.
01:00:14 The other one blue version or something, you know.
01:00:17 Dude, everyone buys the same comic twice.
01:00:20 What if you do it to like the only difference is like the hair color.
01:00:24 But like in this in the script, you get around it by like use.
01:00:27 They're like aliens and they they don't say blue or red.
01:00:29 They say like one of them is like blue hair and pronounce the other
01:00:32 where one or other one is like no hair and no nouns.
01:00:35 What one would it be?
01:00:36 What would be day version and the other one be them version?
01:00:42 That's that's or like or like you could like as long as like maybe
01:00:46 if there's like a part of the story where it's like a character is like,
01:00:48 hey, I like your blue shirt.
01:00:50 You could like it'd be kind of like Mad Libs kind of, you know.
01:00:55 The entire script and Mad Lib like verbs.
01:00:59 This this could work.
01:01:00 This this could work.
01:01:01 I just have to figure out an angle.
01:01:04 No.
01:01:05 OK, I'm back.
01:01:07 I'm back.
01:01:08 I'm back. Let's let's let's see.
01:01:10 See these glowy's.
01:01:12 All right, so it looks that it looks really well, it looks really.
01:01:17 OK, static.
01:01:18 So you can see it in the big like cup there.
01:01:21 You can see how it's only glowing on one side
01:01:23 because like it's like sort of dark and like I think the light just doesn't
01:01:26 like get all the way through it.
01:01:30 Here's here's like a better.
01:01:32 Like a better shot.
01:01:35 I would.
01:01:35 This is really nice.
01:01:37 Just yeah, just as images.
01:01:38 You should make a wall.
01:01:39 I'm going to post this.
01:01:40 Actually, it actually looks really cool in the photo.
01:01:43 It looks like much more vivid in.
01:01:47 OK, OK.
01:01:47 Well, in these pictures, it looks really, really purple in in person.
01:01:51 It doesn't look quite this purple, but also the liquid like glows brighter.
01:01:55 Liquid seems brighter in person than it does in these images.
01:01:58 Maybe that's your eyes, your human eyes, not being able to see purple.
01:02:03 I'm going to post these images on Twitter and be like,
01:02:05 yo, is it normal if your cum glows green under black light?
01:02:09 Is that is that normal?
01:02:10 Oh, yeah, Ben, you're talking last episode about wanting to go for a bit
01:02:14 of a James Lee asphatic with these things you're doing.
01:02:18 Yeah, but like the glowing like eyes and teeth is a what I want.
01:02:23 If you if you want, since I'm a I have a bit of a I'm a little bit of a visual
01:02:27 effects boy. Oh, you have expertise to share.
01:02:31 Yeah, or maybe like you could send your footage my way and I could see about
01:02:37 like making the glowy bits like look extra like glowy and fuck around with it.
01:02:43 I would. That sounds like fun.
01:02:44 I think that might be cool.
01:02:46 Do you do you have any?
01:02:47 I don't know.
01:02:48 Do you have any tips on like how to how to make it work in a in a like how to get
01:02:53 that so that you could do that to it?
01:02:58 Um, I mean, there's a lot of methods I could try.
01:03:01 I'd probably experiment and then like let you know what works.
01:03:06 I probably do it in After Effects.
01:03:07 I'm going to. Yeah, my my idea is just is just like paint
01:03:11 the glowing liquid onto the parts of my face that I want to like.
01:03:17 Yes, obviously, emanate that's a good idea.
01:03:20 That's that's the plan.
01:03:23 Yeah, my my thinking is like in post, we could enhance it even more.
01:03:28 Like, yeah, I could like have it take the bright parts of the image
01:03:33 and like have those like have like a bit of a kind of glow or a bloom sort of effect.
01:03:38 I'd like not not in the gross to PS free bloom era video games.
01:03:43 Right.
01:03:44 I might my plan was to try and like enhance the effect in post,
01:03:48 but like I'm sure you have more.
01:03:49 I'm sure you you probably know how to do that better.
01:03:52 And also, I think you have better software because like I only know I only have Vegas.
01:03:56 That's all I know how to use.
01:03:57 Oh, yeah, Vegas is it's a program struggle to do that kind of thing in Vegas.
01:04:00 Yeah, for sure. OK, that'd be sweet.
01:04:02 Yeah, I'll see I'll see what I get.
01:04:04 I'll let you see it.
01:04:06 That'd be awesome.
01:04:07 I want to fuck around with whatever you got when the time comes.
01:04:10 And then you can look at my result and say yes or no.
01:04:14 No trash.
01:04:17 Let me get this out of my.
01:04:19 Yeah, my idea.
01:04:20 I think I said that my idea is that I want to do that it's going to be an ad
01:04:25 for the Slime and Punishment book, but it's going to be like as the cop killer.
01:04:29 And so I want to have a real like sort of eerie sort of glowing atmosphere to it.
01:04:35 Yeah, are you going to do a funny voice?
01:04:38 I will do maybe a slightly funny voice.
01:04:40 And then maybe I'll add some weird like monstrous kind of oblivion.
01:04:46 Maybe if you would like to add some monster voice sounds to my voice.
01:04:50 That might be cool to I could I could for your voice into manipulator
01:04:55 and have it have that kind of like tractor growly effect to track tractor growly.
01:05:02 I don't know how to explain it.
01:05:05 I guess the cop killer, he would say his voice would be sort of like ragged
01:05:08 and like rough and horse, but also sort of maybe like sort of like sort of inhuman,
01:05:13 sort of like maybe not mechanical, but maybe sort of like maybe a little
01:05:19 bling or oily or or or echo.
01:05:21 He's like he's kind of turned on, but he's shy, you know, or maybe he would have.
01:05:28 No, he doesn't have sex.
01:05:29 He never he never has sex or even thinks it took you a while.
01:05:32 It took you a while to react to the fuck.
01:05:34 I just. Yeah, because I couldn't I just couldn't put it together.
01:05:37 It just didn't compute.
01:05:39 But the cop killer doesn't have a penis.
01:05:40 Maybe he would have sort of like he would have that thing where like he would sort
01:05:43 of have like multiple voices, you know, like like Dorman, like Dorman in in
01:05:49 Shadow of the Colossus, how he was like multiple voices speaking out of the same
01:05:52 voice, I don't know, maybe you'd have a little bit of that like reverb thing going on.
01:05:57 He is he's multitudes.
01:06:00 I don't know. I'm just I'm just throwing ideas out there
01:06:06 because he's a communist because he's a communist, you see.
01:06:08 I'm just being silly.
01:06:10 I'm just being I'm just I'm just kidding, unless.
01:06:15 What else was I talking about?
01:06:18 Nothing. That's it.
01:06:20 Um, can you can you just tell me what this whole this whole perfect comic party thing is?
01:06:25 Can you explain?
01:06:27 Perfect comic party. Great question.
01:06:30 The answer is no. Moving on.
01:06:31 Perfect comic party is an incentive structure to get myself and Ben to actually work in our comics.
01:06:40 And the idea is we will make chapters
01:06:45 and then put them in a PDF together.
01:06:47 And it'll be like, oh, it's our little shonen jump kind of moving.
01:06:50 That's that sounds cool.
01:06:53 That would be really cool.
01:06:55 You guys can even put it up early on like the Patreon for people.
01:06:59 We could. Yeah. Yeah, I think.
01:07:03 Yeah. Well, I mean.
01:07:06 Well, why post it? Well, I posted early.
01:07:09 Well, you know, incentivize people to. Yeah, you're right.
01:07:13 You're right. I hate I hate our patrons.
01:07:15 I don't want them to have. Oh, boy, they don't deserve it.
01:07:18 Yes. Speaking of comics, it's it's out.
01:07:22 It's fine. The first by the time this drops.
01:07:25 Cheesy one of Big Paglacci is all out on Twitter.
01:07:29 Isn't. Yeah, um, I was sad when you posted it because I saw you posted
01:07:35 in Big Paglacci and I was like, oh, my God, it's here.
01:07:38 And then I tried to read it and it wasn't all the way out.
01:07:43 And I was like, no, I can't read the whole thing yet.
01:07:46 It was act one. Yep.
01:07:48 How much of it do you have done?
01:07:50 Oh, I act to act to by the time this video drops,
01:07:54 act two should already be starting like on Twitter.
01:07:57 I thought the whole thing will be posted on my Patreon, obviously.
01:08:00 But I currently like the whole thing.
01:08:04 Yeah. Or you mean the whole act to it?
01:08:05 Don't it's only two acts.
01:08:06 So two is shorter.
01:08:08 Oh, OK.
01:08:10 And I only have six pages left to draw.
01:08:13 And I'm pretty sure to get that all done by the time this video drops.
01:08:18 If it if it doesn't if it doesn't drop,
01:08:21 I recommend you check my Patreon or I actually have the whole thing on my Instagram
01:08:27 because Instagram has this feature.
01:08:29 Instagram basically has kind of like the the little like you could put a story,
01:08:32 which is like a little tiny video kind of like that thing that Twitter
01:08:37 that was trying out where like, oh, you can put kind of like a little
01:08:40 quick clip that stays up for 24 hours above like
01:08:44 if you're doing Twitter mobile will be there.
01:08:47 Instagram so has that feature.
01:08:48 And I literally like put every page in McPaglacci on there.
01:08:52 And then I collect it together in a reel.
01:08:54 And if you go to my Instagram profile,
01:08:57 it's like right there in a collection and you can just read all of act one.
01:09:01 It's literally literally I just dropped all of act one on Instagram.
01:09:05 And and all of act one is also on my
01:09:09 band discord, I but also and I've been slowly updating it on Twitter.
01:09:15 It should be all out by now by the time this video is out.
01:09:20 Currently, as we're recording, I have like four pages left of act one.
01:09:25 And I'm going to drop those off tomorrow.
01:09:29 But it's it's been pretty good.
01:09:31 What do you what do you think of it so far, Ben?
01:09:33 I think I mean, I think the idea is really funny.
01:09:37 I really like it.
01:09:39 And also, yeah, I was reading.
01:09:40 I guess I've only read through what was up when I caught up, which was.
01:09:46 Oh, God, can I spoil it?
01:09:47 Can I say what happens?
01:09:49 Or yeah, go ahead. It's fine.
01:09:50 The part where I got to the part where Ronald
01:09:53 Ronald catches the hamburger and birdie in the in the back room.
01:09:58 And and I don't know.
01:10:00 It's pretty good. I don't know.
01:10:02 It's like, hey, Paythos, I don't know.
01:10:05 I thought I'm I'm compelling.
01:10:07 Hey, I was like, hey, maybe this this opera was pretty good back in the day.
01:10:10 I don't know.
01:10:11 Might have might have been interesting.
01:10:14 I really do love hearing people say that, like, oh, please,
01:10:18 cheesy, drop the pages early because, like, I'm so tempted to just look up
01:10:22 what happens on Wikipedia or something.
01:10:25 No, I want to know.
01:10:26 The people are very in fraud.
01:10:28 And Act 2 is Act 2 is pretty good.
01:10:32 I have I have a couple more Easter eggs and cameos in Act 2.
01:10:36 There's a there's a lot in Act 1 during that big splash page.
01:10:41 I'm not going to name them all.
01:10:43 Uh huh. Uh huh. Right.
01:10:45 But people figure it out.
01:10:46 Right.
01:10:48 But yeah, I'm happy.
01:10:49 Splash page. You mean like the first one when with like the big parade?
01:10:51 Yeah. Yeah.
01:10:53 Yeah. Yeah.
01:10:54 There's a there's like a lot of cameos I put in there.
01:10:57 Of characters that only appeared in one commercial never again.
01:11:02 Right.
01:11:03 There's a there's a couple of deeper cuts in Act 2.
01:11:09 Fascinating.
01:11:10 Yeah. Fascinating.
01:11:12 No, I'm liking it a lot.
01:11:14 I think I think it rule.
01:11:15 I think I'm a I'm a MacPaliachi fan.
01:11:18 I'm a I'm a head. Yeah.
01:11:20 Yeah. I'm hoping a Paghead.
01:11:23 Paghead. I'm I'm I love MacPaliachi.
01:11:26 I love the way he's abusive to I love that he's a groomer.
01:11:29 I like that he's just a groomer.
01:11:32 Yeah, he's straight.
01:11:33 He's straight. He's straight up.
01:11:34 He's straight up a judge turpin.
01:11:37 What do you what?
01:11:38 The the.
01:11:40 Sweet Sweetie Todd.
01:11:42 Yeah. Yeah.
01:11:43 La Mal.
01:11:44 It's so funny you mentioned Sweetie Todd, because I was joking with my part
01:11:48 or being like, if this if this gets really popular, I'll do like
01:11:52 an adaptation of Sweetie Todd, but all the characters are like
01:11:56 the Chuck E. Cheese and Rock a Fire explosion animatronics or something.
01:12:01 OK. And what I'll do is that I'll do that.
01:12:04 Every character that Sweetie Todd kills is actually
01:12:08 an animatronic that was decommissioned and isn't used anymore.
01:12:12 Right. Interesting.
01:12:14 Maybe maybe I probably am not going to do that.
01:12:16 I got like a bunch of other ideas, but I'm glad people are liking it so far.
01:12:21 I like it a lot.
01:12:23 It's great.
01:12:25 I do recommend that our listeners check out
01:12:28 McPagliacchi, McPagliacchi.
01:12:30 This is this is my this is my comeback
01:12:34 from the disaster of clown milk.
01:12:36 This is the comeback right here.
01:12:38 Yeah, true, true.
01:12:41 Yeah, cool.
01:12:42 Yeah, they exactly.
01:12:44 Well, epic.
01:12:46 It's good and I appreciate it.
01:12:48 Thank you for your work on it.
01:12:52 Thank you. OK. Yeah.
01:12:55 Yeah, did you read it?
01:12:57 I read it when you first dropped it.
01:12:59 So I'm only a few pages in.
01:13:00 I haven't seen the bit with Burger Boy.
01:13:04 What's his what's his name?
01:13:05 The hamburger hamburger burger boy.
01:13:10 But yeah, I will read the rest of it soon.
01:13:12 It's good. It's it's it's a funny idea.
01:13:15 I don't know the opera, but it's obviously like
01:13:18 no, no, no serious thing, but with silly people in it.
01:13:22 It's they there's like a version on it.
01:13:26 There's a version in like several parts on YouTube.
01:13:30 In case you want to go watch it,
01:13:32 I recommend you watch it after you're done reading my version,
01:13:36 because each version is like slightly.
01:13:39 I've seen different.
01:13:40 I've seen two different versions of the opera
01:13:41 and I kind of pick and choose parts because
01:13:45 that's that's the awesome thing about like operas or plays
01:13:47 is that they're always different every time you watch them.
01:13:51 And and even they can even have all the same like cast members,
01:13:54 same set, same bill, the same everything.
01:13:56 It's always it's still like always very different because it's a live performance.
01:14:00 Yeah. And even like stuff like even like seating,
01:14:03 even like where you're sit sitting in the theater is like changes to so.
01:14:08 I mean, that changes in regular movies.
01:14:11 Sure. Sure.
01:14:13 Wait, no, but like in a regular in a regular movie,
01:14:15 you like to they choose the shot and wait, no, no, no, no, no, it doesn't
01:14:19 because in a movie, even if you're sitting in a different spot in the theater,
01:14:22 the shot in the movie is the same.
01:14:24 There's a there's a parallax, I understand.
01:14:27 Yeah, like right.
01:14:28 They choose what there's there's someone choosing what you
01:14:31 focus on while in a play.
01:14:33 You could sit closer, you could sit in the back, you know, it's like.
01:14:36 And sometimes you decide you want to just throw shit at the actors
01:14:40 and just see what they do.
01:14:41 Like tapping on the on a fishbowl.
01:14:44 I've been to like plays where like the seats are like surrounding
01:14:48 the kind of theater and it's like it's interesting, you know, but true.
01:14:52 Hey, I definitely had that thought when I'm like in the theater at the top part.
01:14:57 And I'm like, oh, you know, if I arc it right, I could hit the middle of the stage
01:15:01 from here. I really could. I could throw my drink.
01:15:04 It'd be so funny.
01:15:05 I shouldn't do it, though.
01:15:07 I've had that thought at the top of a tall building.
01:15:10 I think, haha, you know, I could just jump off the edge.
01:15:12 You know, I would all be over.
01:15:14 Finally, I shouldn't do it, though.
01:15:17 I'm not going to do it, though.
01:15:19 I'm not going to do it unless.
01:15:22 Unless someone pushes me and I can't help it.
01:15:26 Saying that it's wrong to want to kill yourself.
01:15:28 That's your right, Ben.
01:15:30 It's it's if it's if if wanting to kill myself is wrong, then I don't want to be right.
01:15:36 You know, that's so that's so that's so funny.
01:15:39 Because I actually I do this thing.
01:15:41 I do this terrible sin where I rewatch I re listen to old episodes of the PCP.
01:15:46 Oh, no.
01:15:48 No.
01:15:50 Which one?
01:15:51 You know, there's a full you once shame on us.
01:15:54 Listen to us once shame on us.
01:15:56 Listen to us twice.
01:15:56 Shame on you.
01:15:58 I re listen to the to the suicide episode.
01:16:01 Oh, well, give you are on there.
01:16:03 Then was it? I don't.
01:16:04 Yeah, I don't think I was on that one.
01:16:06 Yeah, you weren't on that one.
01:16:08 And it's like, like, God,
01:16:12 I think I really do think the key here is that you guys just we need to get back
01:16:17 to like just having like seven people on one episode talking over each other.
01:16:21 I think that was the magic spice.
01:16:23 It did. Yeah, it had a it had a it had an energy to it for sure.
01:16:28 I think I think Ben, you should just like over invite people to the podcast.
01:16:32 I don't know.
01:16:33 I don't I haven't really like invited anyone in a while.
01:16:37 Yeah, I asked.
01:16:38 I did ask I did ask one person not that long ago if they wanted to come on.
01:16:42 And they said they said they were nervous or whatever.
01:16:47 They didn't want to do it. I said, OK, you better invite as many people as you can
01:16:51 before you start pissing off people.
01:16:53 You can't get pancakes or no more.
01:16:56 Can we get can we get can we get the the the jilted former members
01:17:00 of the pizza party podcast?
01:17:02 Can we incorporate them?
01:17:03 Can we merge them into the amoeba that is the the PCP universe?
01:17:09 It depends.
01:17:10 You've got to like word it right, because well, the thing is,
01:17:13 I don't think Jim or Izzy taught the pan.
01:17:17 No, like because the thing they weren't they were already barely talking.
01:17:20 I like him very much anymore.
01:17:22 Like, um, yeah, exactly.
01:17:25 And Pan just seems like a.
01:17:29 He just seems like a guy that exists.
01:17:30 I don't see me.
01:17:32 He doesn't see how I could dislike him or like he's completely neutral.
01:17:36 I think I don't know.
01:17:37 You know what? I'm just speculating.
01:17:38 I kind of get a feeling sort of a Doug Walker, like he doesn't know what he's
01:17:43 doing and probably that sucks for everyone that works.
01:17:46 Then I don't know. This is the feeling that I just in the fall in the fallout
01:17:50 of the Pete of the pizza party podcast, everybody seems really upset
01:17:53 with how everything was done.
01:17:55 It's it's he's a real name.
01:17:57 You could say I think I agree.
01:18:00 He's he's being he's being a huge Nate, not not not that bad.
01:18:05 It's it's you would rate your streams.
01:18:07 If you pan pizza would have rated my fucking stream.
01:18:11 It it it's so funny how it's like
01:18:14 former members got kicked off without like pan telling them just because
01:18:19 a guy showed just because that peanut showed up and it was like,
01:18:22 dude, I will literally do everything for you.
01:18:24 You just have to show up and pants like, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.
01:18:28 And Daphne was just like and wait, wait, OK.
01:18:30 And Daphne was like that.
01:18:31 And Pan was like, OK, sure, whatever, do whatever you want.
01:18:34 And then Daphne was like, OK, well, I'm kicking off the former members.
01:18:36 They're gone now. And Pan was like, whatever.
01:18:39 Like, is that how it went?
01:18:41 Well, how it went was that like, oh, my God, I I saw like how it went
01:18:48 was that the former members found out they weren't going to be on
01:18:53 because of the tweet that dropped of it getting rebooted.
01:18:55 And Pan never told Izzy, who was supposed to be in charge of the new podcast.
01:19:01 Anything. OK. And then after that, Pan like started apologizing like, oh,
01:19:05 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
01:19:06 The tweet, the tweet that dropped was from Daphne,
01:19:09 saying the Pizza Party podcast has been reworked and now I'm on it
01:19:13 and my friends are on it and the old guys are gone.
01:19:15 Or am I or is that not right?
01:19:18 That's they never mentioned anything about the old people being gone.
01:19:22 They just didn't say.
01:19:23 So Daphne just tweeted, the Pizza Party podcast will now be these new people.
01:19:28 And that's the and that's the announcement.
01:19:30 Lol. He said he'd be in charge.
01:19:33 I don't like Daphne.
01:19:34 I everything.
01:19:36 The more I learn about him, the worse the worse he seems.
01:19:39 Oh, I'm going to I'm going to give you some exclusive dirt on Daphne.
01:19:43 That is not public knowledge.
01:19:44 I don't see. I think that if I think that Daphne would never
01:19:49 betray you like that.
01:19:50 So I really think that it's really, really despicable.
01:19:54 No, I'm kidding.
01:19:55 I think that is a is a snake and he would betray anyone.
01:19:59 He would betray his own mother for a nickel, just like shadow from Final Fantasy Six.
01:20:03 I haven't spoken to Daphne.
01:20:05 Several of my friends have.
01:20:06 My friend made who is who I've mentioned a bunch.
01:20:10 He he was in a video about Pennsylvania that Daphne did.
01:20:14 You know, I think it was remember the artist of fury on art.
01:20:18 They're like that really good artist who yeah, also like said,
01:20:21 like a whole bunch of extremely like extreme was that was that the person who was like
01:20:27 I can't they were like, were they like pretending to be black or something?
01:20:31 Or no, they were.
01:20:32 No, they're they're actually black.
01:20:34 I thought I thought there was no way to really clarify if he was black or not.
01:20:38 No, they posted pictures of themselves.
01:20:41 They posted pictures of their hands.
01:20:42 Didn't they just their hand?
01:20:44 It looked dark to me.
01:20:46 Oh, well, I trick it a little trick.
01:20:49 Well, if I trust him, go ahead.
01:20:50 I'm not I'm not going to just assume someone's white because they said the n word.
01:20:54 That that's the tell.
01:20:56 That's the tell.
01:20:58 I'm just I'm saying I'll get gone.
01:21:02 And I saw their hair, too.
01:21:03 It looked like, you know, it.
01:21:06 OK, I just I just I just remember I feel like I heard that
01:21:10 he said some stuff and people said, you shouldn't say that you're not black.
01:21:14 And he said, yes, I am.
01:21:15 And other people were saying, I don't think he is.
01:21:17 And so that's what just what I remember.
01:21:19 And then he posted pictures.
01:21:21 OK, didn't post his face.
01:21:22 We saw his arm and saw his hair and stuff.
01:21:25 And it looks looks pretty black to me.
01:21:27 Sure. I don't care about the n word
01:21:30 stuff, particularly because that's up in the air.
01:21:32 He did like post a bunch of like pictures of nooses
01:21:35 saying ha ha trans people and yourselves.
01:21:36 He was doing that shit.
01:21:38 He is a he is an actual piece of shit.
01:21:40 I do not like him and I do not want to defend him even a little bit.
01:21:43 The thing that the issue I have with Daphne in that video is the way he.
01:21:48 Oh, God, maybe I shouldn't mention this.
01:21:50 It's the way he roped teleperte into being on there.
01:21:54 Because teleperte doesn't like to comment on this sort of stuff.
01:21:57 He just he's just not comfortable talking about sort of controversial topics.
01:22:01 It's just not something that he was comfortable doing.
01:22:05 And Daphne is like, hey, can I call you real quick?
01:22:09 And he's like, and he's like, OK, can I record you and tell you?
01:22:11 He's like, yeah. And then he's like, OK,
01:22:14 look, look at all these screenshots of things if you're in our art did.
01:22:17 Now, tell me, give me the sound bite.
01:22:19 Give me the sound bite of you saying that you're disappointed in him.
01:22:23 And tell you sitting here thinking I don't want to be here.
01:22:26 But like he was just kind of pressured in because he wanted to want to be
01:22:30 able to put a sound bite of he wanted to be able to have like
01:22:34 here's teleperte saying that like how disappointed they are in so and so.
01:22:38 Yeah, it's like it's like it's just kind of weird to do that to someone who
01:22:43 without like like just putting someone on the spot and being like,
01:22:47 hey, you're going to be in my video, I'm going to use you as the bludgeon.
01:22:49 You're going to be the bat that I'm going to use to like like smack this guy
01:22:53 and be like, oh, look, this artist you look up to is disappointed in you.
01:22:56 It's like, I don't know.
01:22:58 I feel like you should like that person's consent to be in like a drama video.
01:23:04 If they don't want to be in a fucking drama video.
01:23:06 Yeah, even if like even if the criticism is extremely fucking valid.
01:23:09 I don't like I feel it's a good thing to do.
01:23:12 I mean, I mean, yeah, if teleperte wanted to make a comment on that, then like cool.
01:23:18 But if he like didn't want to end up like extracted it from him for for use
01:23:24 in his content, then that seems weird and bad.
01:23:27 Teleperte seems very.
01:23:31 Non confrontational, I guess.
01:23:33 So he seems like he's quiet.
01:23:36 I don't know.
01:23:37 He's just a quiet like I just want to draw.
01:23:40 Right.
01:23:41 I just want to draw and chill.
01:23:42 OK. I know.
01:23:44 I know on two occasions, Daph Pina has tried has talked to two different
01:23:49 friends who are who of his who are black and to ask them, can you like voice over
01:23:54 this line where like it's a criticism on a white person about like them being like
01:23:59 racist because Daph didn't want to do it.
01:24:02 And he's all thinking like, oh, if I get a black person to voice it, you know,
01:24:05 it sounds more like, you know, oh, this is a big no, no.
01:24:07 And the both he's trying to make the race war real.
01:24:12 And and like and like both both black people that I'm aware of said no.
01:24:16 But he did.
01:24:16 I think he did found like one black person who said yes to like doing a scab.
01:24:21 Scab.
01:24:23 I'm I found OK.
01:24:26 I found this like Reddit post that is on the rebel taxi Reddit.
01:24:31 And it's I read it.
01:24:33 I reread it.
01:24:34 And like, there's some fuck shit that I forgot about where like there was an
01:24:38 opportunity, there was like an opportunity where Pan could have told Izzy and Jim
01:24:43 what was going to happen.
01:24:45 But he just stayed silent.
01:24:46 So OK, I'm it's just I can't I can't believe it.
01:24:50 Like is is is it is am I right in that?
01:24:54 Like Daph just said, hey, let me take care of the podcast.
01:24:58 And Pan was like, OK, and then nothing else was said.
01:25:02 And then the announcement comes out that's like, there's a new cast.
01:25:06 OK, so that's how Jim and Izzy find out.
01:25:09 Like, that's insane.
01:25:10 So so there was a there was a voice call like because Izzy was
01:25:15 hand said to Izzy that, oh, you could be in charge of the podcast
01:25:18 at Momo Con of last year after they did their panel.
01:25:22 And then Izzy was like getting ready for that.
01:25:24 And then suddenly she's getting like DMs and like that Pina is like
01:25:30 a voice calling her and giving her all these suggestions for the podcast.
01:25:34 And she's like, what the fuck are you doing?
01:25:36 Like, why are you telling me all this?
01:25:37 And he and like Izzy was, I think, and then after that, they
01:25:44 weren't another voice call with Jim and a bunch of close friends.
01:25:48 And Izzy was trying to clarify with Jim and Pan.
01:25:51 Like, do you want like the podcast to be something where like we're trying
01:25:54 to make money or do you just want to just be a friend thing?
01:25:57 Because up until that point, the whole time, the the Pizza Party
01:26:00 podcast has just been a friend thing.
01:26:02 It's just something that like an outlet for them to talk, right?
01:26:05 Right. And Jim said they wanted Jim wanted to be a friend thing.
01:26:09 And Pan never really gave an answer to like what he wanted, apparently.
01:26:14 Right. And so then, like, meanwhile, like Izzy is keeps getting
01:26:19 like DMs from Pan from Daft Pina and she's not replying to them
01:26:23 because she's like, who the fuck are you, dude? Fuck off.
01:26:25 Like, I don't know why you keep DMing me, right?
01:26:27 And then like, and then Jim.
01:26:32 I think, OK, I'm looking at it right now.
01:26:35 And I turned out he couldn't swim.
01:26:38 Yeah. So I think I think Jim then texts Izzy and he's like,
01:26:43 did you know about the podcast reboot?
01:26:45 And like, they both found out due to, like, the tweet
01:26:49 and they had they both had no fucking idea.
01:26:51 So the long and short of it is that Daft just pretty much booted them
01:26:55 with without telling them.
01:26:58 Ultimately, I guess I think what happened was that if I like, I don't know.
01:27:04 I mean, I guess like to give Pan like a modicum of credit.
01:27:08 What I assume happened is that he was probably approached by Daft
01:27:13 to run the podcast. He he said yes.
01:27:17 And I think maybe that maybe I have no idea for this for me.
01:27:21 But maybe Daft brought up the suggestion that, oh, I'll tell Izzy about it.
01:27:26 Like, I'll be the one to break the news to Izzy.
01:27:28 And Pan was like, all right, dude, yeah, yeah.
01:27:30 And this is the whole time.
01:27:32 The whole time, like, Daft is trying to send messages to Izzy
01:27:35 and she has like no idea why, because no one told her that he'd be newly in charge.
01:27:39 And then like out of out of nowhere, they were dropped.
01:27:43 Without fucking realizing this is so stupid.
01:27:45 This is so stupid. I'm sorry.
01:27:47 I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to give Pan any credit.
01:27:49 Like, what the fuck is wrong with everyone in this?
01:27:52 Like, I'm sorry, if you're if you're if you're pan in the situation
01:27:55 and you have any fucking fucking integrity or a fucking cell in your fucking brain,
01:28:00 you hear about this and you go, oh, what the fuck?
01:28:02 Why did you do that? Well, Daft, get out.
01:28:06 You know, you you.
01:28:08 Yeah, I told you you could take over the podcast,
01:28:10 but I didn't think you were going to kick the host.
01:28:12 Obviously, you can't do that. Leave.
01:28:16 Undo undo everything that has been done.
01:28:18 It's my podcast and I and I'm like, like, oops, made a mistake.
01:28:22 Let's let's hit the reset button on it.
01:28:25 I don't know, unless he didn't want to do the podcast anymore, for some reason.
01:28:28 Like, why does any of this mean that I have ownership?
01:28:31 Yeah, I won't do the labor, but I will make the decision.
01:28:33 I think sure pan ironically is like, hold on.
01:28:37 Like I was I was thinking about it over.
01:28:39 And I was looking back to all the times
01:28:42 I was thinking back to all the times
01:28:43 Pan said he doesn't care about this podcast.
01:28:45 And at the time I was thinking, oh, that's why he's so nonchalant
01:28:49 about the podcast, because he doesn't care.
01:28:50 But maybe what he actually meant was I really don't care at all about the pot.
01:28:56 Like, yeah, podcasts like this.
01:28:58 He actually does not.
01:28:59 Does he actually just not care and not give a fucking out?
01:29:01 Want to do it?
01:29:03 I it's the thing is that if so, then I guess I don't do it.
01:29:06 I mean, he just he just does it ultimately.
01:29:09 And and then the thing is that like the thing that I don't know.
01:29:14 I think that like, I think that got a bunch of shit, too,
01:29:18 because everyone everyone figured out easily about the whole just stop video
01:29:22 and how like, oh, obviously, that is fucking pulling the strings here, right?
01:29:25 And then just stop clarified.
01:29:27 And then like Veronica drops her version of the video and she's all like, oh, yeah,
01:29:31 that is like the cynical little asshole who's like always trying to manipulate shit.
01:29:36 Right.
01:29:37 And just like all these things like dumped on the same week for Daph.
01:29:40 And Daph was getting so much bad press press.
01:29:43 If you look at the last Twitter post that Daph made, where he talks about
01:29:47 because his recent video was he did like he did a video about the A.I.
01:29:51 Seinfeld thing. Yeah.
01:29:52 And the majority of people in the comments are replying with.
01:29:56 They were playing with that one picture of Quagmire and Brian having dinner.
01:30:02 And they're all like, they're all like spamming that image to Daph
01:30:04 because in Veronica's video, she she sent that image to Daph to make fun of him
01:30:10 because she was trying to say, oh, you're Brian in this picture.
01:30:14 Yes. And and and Daph got really mad about that.
01:30:17 So everyone's just spamming that to him. Right.
01:30:20 You are the soy jack. You are the Brian.
01:30:23 And and ultimately.
01:30:26 I'm looking here at the end of like Izzy's whole post about.
01:30:31 About Pan. I mean, I mean, some.
01:30:34 Pan Pan owns the whole operation.
01:30:37 All Pan would have to do is just say.
01:30:40 We'll just keep doing it.
01:30:41 We like never mind.
01:30:42 We'll just keep doing the pizza party podcast as before.
01:30:45 There's literally nothing stopping him from just doing that.
01:30:47 I think so. I guess he just doesn't want to, which is fine.
01:30:51 I guess.
01:30:52 Yeah, I'm going to call this now.
01:30:54 I'm going to call this now.
01:30:55 They're going to reboot the podcast again because I'm looking at
01:30:59 like people talking about the new lineup and everyone says that.
01:31:03 Oh, this Dumsville guy who's like mango, who's like Pan's boyfriend friend.
01:31:09 This guy called Dumsville.
01:31:10 He apparently has like a pretty bad history.
01:31:13 So he like he's probably going to get in some drama or some shit or someone else.
01:31:18 No, it's just so like.
01:31:20 Well, it was I don't know. It's so funny.
01:31:22 Like they said, OK, the podcast is rebooted with a new cast.
01:31:25 And then, OK, no, never mind.
01:31:27 The new the rebooted podcast is now we're rebooting it again.
01:31:30 But now with my boyfriend.
01:31:32 Oh, never mind.
01:31:33 No, OK, that's not the pizza.
01:31:34 That's actually a new podcast with a different name,
01:31:36 but it's still with the new cast with my boyfriend.
01:31:39 OK, now that's canceled.
01:31:40 And now we're going to we're going to go back.
01:31:42 I don't know. Do you think they're just going to go back?
01:31:44 What I want to know is where's the podcast?
01:31:46 Wait, in all of this, in all of this, the question nobody's answering.
01:31:50 Where's the fucking podcast?
01:31:52 It keeps moving.
01:31:53 It's finally happening. If finally we lost it, we lost it for good.
01:31:57 There's no I mean, I'll say, I'll say this,
01:31:59 the podcast is probably going to keep existing as long as like and and like
01:32:03 Manga are dating, OK?
01:32:05 But that's not that's not the pizza party podcast.
01:32:07 That's the P3. That's a PPP.
01:32:10 It's the P3.
01:32:11 It's the P3 podcast.
01:32:13 It's a nightmare.
01:32:14 It's a fucking nightmare.
01:32:16 The podcast is harder to find and more elusive than ever.
01:32:19 I'll I'll say this.
01:32:20 I'm kind of.
01:32:22 Um, oh, the podcast melted
01:32:26 into my pillow and all the gathered
01:32:30 I'm not really saying I'm not really looking forward
01:32:34 to this new podcast if you couldn't tell.
01:32:37 But that being said, like the thing is that because like, look,
01:32:42 I'm like very neutral with everybody on this.
01:32:45 OK, even even someone like even like Mango, I think I think they're they're right.
01:32:50 They're like they're whatever.
01:32:52 They they seem chill again.
01:32:54 I've talked to them in the DMs.
01:32:55 They seem chill enough.
01:32:56 That being said, I have listened to Mango Mango talk on like on like Twitter
01:33:02 spaces and he mostly just talks about all the all all the sex that he's having
01:33:08 with Pan. That's funny.
01:33:10 I mean, whenever I whenever I briefly followed Mango unfollowed him
01:33:14 because he was annoying, like most of his posts are just about how he's
01:33:18 Pan's boyfriend and I just find that insufferable.
01:33:20 That's I'm pretty sure that's what it's going to he's going to be like
01:33:24 on this podcast, which is like, oh, God, I'm not I look forward to this.
01:33:28 Awesome. That I'm going to keep commenting, though.
01:33:30 No, Jim, no, watch on the new episodes, because I still think that's super funny.
01:33:37 And I need it. I seriously needed to catch on.
01:33:39 I you know what? You know what?
01:33:40 Maybe I'll maybe I'll stop by and maybe I'll drop it.
01:33:43 No, Jim, no, Izzy, no, watch.
01:33:44 No, Jim, no, Izzy, no, Ken, no, no, no, no, watch, no, no, no, watch.
01:33:49 Yeah. No, darling, bring it back.
01:33:51 He's he's he's he's now a little bit less controversial than daffy.
01:33:54 No, bring it back. Free our boy.
01:33:58 Oh, God, it's it's epic.
01:34:01 It's it's great.
01:34:02 You know, it's all all my podcasts are changing before my eyes, you know, it's funny.
01:34:10 Oh, you know what?
01:34:12 Gibb, I was trying to build a website.
01:34:14 I was trying to build I was I was building a little website on my computer.
01:34:22 There's not much to it.
01:34:23 It's pretty much just like a page with like a list of links
01:34:27 to like download the episodes.
01:34:30 Oh, yeah, the MP3 use.
01:34:32 Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
01:34:33 I'm kind of just envisioning that like the PCP website will just be like a landing page
01:34:38 with just like two columns.
01:34:41 And on the left is all the PCP episode MP3s listed in like reverse chronological order.
01:34:46 And if you want to listen to the latest one, you just click the top one and it downloads
01:34:50 and on the right side is, you know, the the to soon to be filled
01:34:56 list of a perfect, perfect comic parties, PDFs, and you download them
01:35:02 and like not much else to it, really.
01:35:05 I think that's kind of my vision for the the the the PCP website.
01:35:11 Just simple hub, just a simple hub for our content.
01:35:16 Yeah, imagine that.
01:35:19 Anyway, simple and clean, simple and clean and gay.
01:35:23 And the way the way it should be tonight.
01:35:27 That song. I'm hard. Yes.
01:35:29 You know, it's I've always found it so I've always found it so weird
01:35:34 that that song is about like it's about like, yeah, it's about like red flags
01:35:40 in a relationship and like hesitancy to commit and like uncertainty
01:35:44 in a game that's like thematically just about like love and friendship are good.
01:35:48 And we love love and friendship so much.
01:35:51 Isn't that weird?
01:35:53 It is weird. I think it is.
01:35:55 I always thought that like the lyrics of that song, like I love the tune of it.
01:35:59 I love the song, but the lyrics of it are like
01:36:02 weirdly like mature and like morally gray and ambiguous
01:36:07 compared to the content of the game.
01:36:09 It's OK. It's a Japanese game.
01:36:11 And I kids, kids don't listen to lyrics.
01:36:15 Ever. That's that's true.
01:36:18 When I was in when I was in elementary school,
01:36:21 the two most popular songs were about like jizzing,
01:36:25 like just coming on on women.
01:36:27 What are you fucking talking about?
01:36:28 What the fuck are you talking about?
01:36:30 Wait, you don't know.
01:36:32 You don't know little fuck.
01:36:33 You don't know little John.
01:36:34 Ah, ski, ski, ski, ski, ski, ski, ski. Oh, wait.
01:36:38 And oh, wait, no, that's true.
01:36:39 You're absolutely right.
01:36:40 And then and then the other one. My balls.
01:36:42 That one, the other the other classic one
01:36:45 was a daddy Yankees, a gasolina,
01:36:49 which was about like a woman who loves it when you come a lot on her.
01:36:53 I don't even know that one.
01:36:55 Oh, that's a little bit.
01:36:56 That's a little bit too.
01:36:57 That's a little bit too ethnic for you. Honkies, huh?
01:37:00 I would say, yeah.
01:37:01 Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
01:37:03 That's what I was going to say.
01:37:04 You got caught. I don't like he's too black sounding for me.
01:37:07 I don't like singers.
01:37:08 You got you got got copy and white again.
01:37:12 Because of 4K on 4K.
01:37:15 Oops, got him.
01:37:16 Ben saying copy and white again.
01:37:18 Don't you like don't you like that part in American Psycho
01:37:21 where Patrick Bateman is racist?
01:37:23 It was pretty good.
01:37:24 I want to get a T-shirt of Pat.
01:37:26 I might just make this T-shirt myself and sell it.
01:37:28 Where and because I feel like this would be a really good T-shirt to wear
01:37:32 nowadays because the Jewish community needs it.
01:37:35 But it's that's the quote.
01:37:36 Why is I like, well, well, cool, cool with the anti-semitic remarks.
01:37:40 Just on a show with the anti-semitic remarks.
01:37:42 OK, and it'll be a picture of Christian Bale.
01:37:44 I don't have a yarmulke like, oh, cool with the anti-semitic remarks.
01:37:47 Yeah. Only he should be only he should be a goblin.
01:37:53 He plays a goblin.
01:37:55 I heard that.
01:37:57 Because in the original obligatory Patrick and Naidman,
01:38:03 but I heard that in the fucking new Hogwarts,
01:38:07 I almost called the new J.K. Rowling Patrick,
01:38:09 Patrick Bateman would have would have Ray Patrick Bateman would have raided my stream.
01:38:13 He would have.
01:38:16 I heard in the new Harry Potter game,
01:38:18 there's even more like Jewish comparisons to the bad guys are goblins.
01:38:23 They're there a while ago.
01:38:25 It's a goblin rebellion.
01:38:27 OK, OK, there's a goblin rebellion.
01:38:29 And I know that there's that horn that is supposedly similar to like a Jewish horn.
01:38:36 That is described in the game as just being like annoying.
01:38:39 They have horns.
01:38:40 Have you been watching much more at Ben?
01:38:41 No, no, no, no.
01:38:43 Like a musical horn like oblivion.
01:38:45 You don't watch curvy enthusiasm.
01:38:47 There's a whole episode where Larry David is giving the Jewish horn
01:38:51 that calls all the Jews when he sounds it.
01:38:55 Is the real that's a real episode.
01:38:57 That's a real. OK, OK,
01:38:59 for I from what I've heard,
01:39:01 I know that like the center of the of the plot is yes,
01:39:03 it's about like the goblins have a rebellion.
01:39:07 But I've also heard that there's sort of a twist at the end.
01:39:09 And like, it turns out the goblins were framed,
01:39:12 like the goblins are actually not bad.
01:39:14 They're being like framed or manipulated into doing something, whatever they're doing.
01:39:19 Also, OK, that star.
01:39:23 I know the reason that's there is because this scene was just filmed
01:39:27 in like a real building and that's just what the floor of the building that they I know.
01:39:32 It was a real bank. It was a real bank.
01:39:34 So you're saying it's real.
01:39:37 You are J.Q.ing right now, Ben, by saying what?
01:39:40 No, what? No.
01:39:43 Got it. Listen, I'm just listen.
01:39:46 I'm just trying to I'm just defending J.K. Rowling.
01:39:48 OK, I'm just saying I'm just saying she's good, actually.
01:39:50 I'm just saying I listen.
01:39:52 I might like a lot of important things to say about women.
01:39:54 Obviously, they just picked a bank and probably didn't even think about it.
01:39:58 And that's how I got in there.
01:39:59 And it's just really they probably probably no one was even thinking
01:40:03 about the whole, you know, of a drawing of I mean, it's enough.
01:40:07 I don't think it's it's honestly enough that like the bankers of the wizarding world
01:40:12 are the goblins described as they are in the book.
01:40:17 It's like the comparisons, the sort of like.
01:40:22 I could. Yeah, you know, you know, what this is.
01:40:24 Yeah, did you have to read it like this way?
01:40:26 You know what I think this is?
01:40:27 OK, it's what what you were saying at the cheesy.
01:40:30 You were saying about how was it Grant Morrison?
01:40:35 Alan Moore is Alan Alan Moore.
01:40:38 Like even he, despite being like against, you know, he sort of falls into the.
01:40:43 Yeah, he sort of falls into the tropes.
01:40:45 I don't know. I think that's what that's what this goblin thing is.
01:40:47 It's like, yeah, the goblins do look like an anti-semitic stereotype.
01:40:52 And it's not like anyone set out deliberately to make them that way.
01:40:55 It's just like our cultural conception of a greedy part of a greedy banker.
01:41:00 Is like so inextricably tied to that that image.
01:41:03 You know, that kind of came out that. Yeah.
01:41:05 That kind of reminds me of, you know, the game,
01:41:08 Peaks the Tower that came out, by the way, great game.
01:41:11 There was a character. I know what you're going to say.
01:41:13 I saw I saw the I saw the picture.
01:41:14 There was a character called Mr.
01:41:16 Pinch and people were saying this is like anti-semitic caricature.
01:41:19 And it's you know, it's so annoying when like people hear that and they say,
01:41:22 like, oh, actually, you're anti-semitic because you say it looks like a Jew.
01:41:25 And it's like, no, we're not saying it looks like a fucking Jew.
01:41:27 We're saying it looks like a Jewish stereotype idiot.
01:41:30 There's those are two different things.
01:41:31 That being said, someone said, like, Mr. Pinch.
01:41:34 Yeah, I'm going to find an image of Mr. Pinch posting right now.
01:41:37 But anyway, everyone was everyone was saying
01:41:39 he's actually based on Ebenezer Scrooge from the Christmas Carol, right?
01:41:43 I looked up the name Ebenezer.
01:41:45 It's a Jewish name.
01:41:46 So that makes me think like God.
01:41:49 And like Carousel's Carol is like, even even chickens.
01:41:52 Yeah, even chickens couldn't.
01:41:54 Yeah, because it's like there's all these like subtle things that like we
01:41:57 like people are saying, oh, it's OK.
01:41:58 It's not anti-semitic is based on Ebenezer Scrooge.
01:42:00 And it's like, well, Ebenezer Scrooge himself is anti-semitic.
01:42:04 It kind of a character, right?
01:42:05 You can't cancel Dickens.
01:42:07 I mean, think about it.
01:42:08 He's a rich guy who doesn't celebrate Christmas.
01:42:10 Oh, gee, whiz. I wonder who it was. Oh, my God.
01:42:13 Oh, my God. He was there.
01:42:16 He was there at Golgotha, it's nailing our savior to the cross.
01:42:20 It was him. It's all these subtle things.
01:42:23 It's just so yeah, it's just in serious.
01:42:26 You got to question everything, you know, like.
01:42:28 I like my main question is not like in like in like the like the fucking
01:42:33 early 2000s or late 90s or whatever, when they filmed the first Harry Potter
01:42:36 movie, were they like intentionally doing that?
01:42:39 You know, I think it is like you said, like they just they just went with the
01:42:41 tropes and didn't think about it.
01:42:43 What it what confuses me is that after all the discourse in current year
01:42:48 where people are thinking about this shit and people are like aware of this shit,
01:42:52 why would they then in the new game that just came out, give the goblins
01:42:56 a musical instrument that looks like a traditional, you know, Jewish thing?
01:43:00 That's the that's the spicy question that I'm wondering.
01:43:03 Don't I don't know.
01:43:07 It's like you could say, I mean, it is true that it's like it's
01:43:12 culturally like passed down unconscious biases that we just don't really think
01:43:17 about J.K. Rowling had that when she designed the goblins the way they did.
01:43:21 But it's also like, oh, and she just turned out to be a massive bigot as well.
01:43:26 In a different way, it's right now.
01:43:30 Right, you know, I like to believe
01:43:32 because she was neoliberal the whole time.
01:43:34 That's why, you know, the huge Neolib.
01:43:39 Like, I, you know, even like I want to fucking even like I'll say it even
01:43:44 like in villain verse, I have like very kind of unconscious things like the main
01:43:49 character is this goblin guy and he's like the source of all evil, right?
01:43:53 And it's like, damn, like what?
01:43:55 Like, because the thing is, I love is the villain Jewish.
01:43:58 The villain isn't Jewish, but he's like part of the original first
01:44:02 like people that showed up on his planet and, you know, that could go back to like,
01:44:06 oh, well, Jews are kind of like the oldest religion almost.
01:44:10 Oh, yeah, I've I've I've seen I've seen the history of history of Earth,
01:44:16 spirit science and I know about the Hebrews coming from Mars or whatever.
01:44:20 And the thing is that he's like a goblin guy who loves gold.
01:44:23 And it's like, oh, my God.
01:44:24 It's the thing is like, I love the villain as a character and I love
01:44:28 and I love the Jewish people.
01:44:30 Me, me, I, you won't find a bigger, you won't get there.
01:44:34 And I love Sigma and I love X.
01:44:37 And I love you won't find a bigger, a bigger
01:44:40 a Hebrew like myself out there.
01:44:43 I'm saying that right now.
01:44:46 I'm a huge ally, you know, I like, look,
01:44:49 if it was up to me, I would have converted to Judaism.
01:44:52 But, you know, they won't allow it.
01:44:53 They won't let me.
01:44:55 They said, I'm not funny enough.
01:44:56 You won't give them your foreskin.
01:44:58 They said I'm banned from temple after the incident.
01:45:00 They said I'm not funny enough to be Jewish.
01:45:02 So, you know what? And they know better.
01:45:05 You know, they've been around here the longest.
01:45:06 They know better.
01:45:07 That being said, I I am going to rethink a lot of different things.
01:45:11 Because I feel like I feel like there's like enough in Villainverse where it's
01:45:14 like, OK, it's it's it's not I'm not trying to be anti-Semitic.
01:45:18 I just love goblins. I just oh, I love goblins.
01:45:20 Yeah, I love goblins.
01:45:21 I love little green characters.
01:45:23 I think I think, I don't know.
01:45:25 Some some people say that, like, goblins are always anti-Semitic,
01:45:29 no matter what. And like, I think that that can't possibly be true.
01:45:33 I think there's definitely versions of goblins that are OK.
01:45:36 And there's a lineage, but that doesn't necessarily mean
01:45:39 that every depiction is with that intent.
01:45:42 I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to it's just a cultural thing now.
01:45:44 It's it's like a little creature.
01:45:46 Those goblins I see now are just short green woman with huge tits.
01:45:52 And this is how this is how I'm going to redeem the villain is how I'm going to redeem him.
01:45:57 He is going in a future chapter.
01:45:59 And this is this is not a joke.
01:46:00 This is 100 percent not ironic in a future chapter.
01:46:04 I am going to make him mention that he has a foreskin.
01:46:09 Boom. Problem solved.
01:46:12 Like a boy eating pork or something.
01:46:15 And maybe that's how we defeat him.
01:46:16 They tug on his foreskin and he screams, no spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.
01:46:20 Have him have him eat pork.
01:46:22 Just just every whenever you can just have him do something that's not kosher.
01:46:27 Yeah, exactly. I'll have him do so much like anti kosher stuff.
01:46:31 And you know what? Let's be honest.
01:46:33 Like a real Jew wouldn't create this massive
01:46:36 galactic operation that the villain would have.
01:46:38 Come on, that's a little too much work. Come on.
01:46:41 Was he didn't he fuck like a giant bug?
01:46:45 Yeah, he did. Planet.
01:46:47 Does that kosher?
01:46:49 Is that maybe we are.
01:46:51 Is that Haram?
01:46:53 If I'm going to go, I should, I should go back in time
01:46:55 and redraw that image where we see the villains.
01:46:58 You should have a free Palestine sticker.
01:47:00 Yeah, exactly.
01:47:01 It'll be like, finally, I've collected all the villain balls.
01:47:05 And I'm like, yeah, free Palestine.
01:47:08 Just just make him like he's like he's the he's the most.
01:47:12 OK, he's the most evil creature in the world.
01:47:14 But even he there's he's not even he can be completely evil.
01:47:18 He does support Palestinian liberation.
01:47:20 It's the one thing that he's good about.
01:47:24 And it proves that he's not Jewish also.
01:47:27 And you can be Jewish and hate Israel.
01:47:31 There are two different things.
01:47:32 I don't understand what you're talking about.
01:47:34 We're just we're just trying to do as many anti stereotypes as possible.
01:47:37 That's all we're just. Yeah, we're just trying to be as we're just we're just
01:47:40 trying to be as not Jewish.
01:47:42 We're just trying to be as anti Semitic as possible here,
01:47:44 because we're not every look.
01:47:46 Everything I do, I do it.
01:47:48 I do it for the Jew.
01:47:50 All right, everything I do, I do it for the.
01:47:55 And that's that's not being ironic.
01:47:57 What if no, what if he what if he is circumcised
01:48:00 and he but he just he kept the foreskin and he keeps it like in like a case
01:48:04 and like he has a guy who like goes to the case
01:48:06 and like cleans it off or like display.
01:48:09 He has the most foreskin.
01:48:10 You have you have to you have you have to show it.
01:48:13 You have to show it so that we can see that.
01:48:16 Yes, it is still attached.
01:48:18 It's the only way.
01:48:19 It's the only way I'll figure out a way.
01:48:21 Oh, no, I'll figure out attached.
01:48:23 It would have to still be honest.
01:48:24 You know, speaking of like like little goofy characters.
01:48:29 You know, I'm going to give a pretty brief hot take here.
01:48:34 And this is going to get me like this is going to get me canceled.
01:48:37 We haven't yet.
01:48:38 We haven't we haven't gone far enough on this episode.
01:48:41 I like I really like I think this design is really cute.
01:48:47 But I know.
01:48:48 But I know it's terrible.
01:48:49 It's a terrible design that we should not keep reusing.
01:48:53 And OK, do you guys know what a golly walk is?
01:48:57 You guys know what a golly walk is?
01:48:58 Golly.
01:48:59 Yes, I know what a golly walk is.
01:49:01 Yeah, it's the dragon quest slime face, but with black face as well.
01:49:05 Yeah, exactly. It's I hate how cute this is, but I know it's terrible.
01:49:10 And we shouldn't do this at all.
01:49:12 That being said, I see what you mean.
01:49:15 I see what you mean.
01:49:16 I mean, yeah, it is for it is friendly looking.
01:49:19 It is very friendly looking.
01:49:20 It's it's not that that same like the eyes of a black cat sort of sort of face.
01:49:27 It's like there's there's like ways to kind of like redeem this.
01:49:31 It's just don't do the like I feel like once you do the oblivion.
01:49:35 Yeah, I'm kind of with you oblivion.
01:49:38 I've had it. I've had it.
01:49:39 Only when she only when cheesy Manfredo is here,
01:49:43 does imagery like this appear on the PCP.
01:49:46 Yeah, in the chat now.
01:49:48 I'm not.
01:49:50 I'm.
01:49:52 Explain yourself, putting me.
01:49:53 You're putting me on a list, cheesy.
01:49:55 There's this whole there's this whole bit in in Alan Moore's book,
01:49:59 League of Externary Gentlemen, where like, because everything,
01:50:01 every like piece of fiction is canon, one of these guys shows up,
01:50:04 a gollywag shows up, and he's like on the good guy's team.
01:50:07 He's like a good person.
01:50:08 And at the whole time, I'm thinking like, this is bad.
01:50:11 But I mean, at least he's like a good guy, right?
01:50:13 But then like later in the book, it talks about the lore of the gollywags.
01:50:17 And they're like, oh, there are a race of aliens that were enslaved.
01:50:21 And I'm like, OK, all right, buddy, all right, Mr.
01:50:24 Buddy, look at these these non-humans.
01:50:27 Oh, God, I hate that so much.
01:50:29 Fucking like League of Externary Gentlemen is kind of like for every
01:50:33 like for every like one step of a progressive direction, it takes like two steps back.
01:50:39 Right. Like, oh, he's shining a light on care.
01:50:42 Oh, there's a trans character.
01:50:43 He's shining a light on like characters that wouldn't have spotlights
01:50:46 in the books that they're in.
01:50:48 Oh, he's like reevaluating like British neoliberalism.
01:50:51 Oh, it's a commentary on fascism.
01:50:53 Oh, all this stuff, all this stuff about culture is worth keeping.
01:50:57 It's great. It's awesome. It's base.
01:50:59 But then he doesn't really question that maybe some of the imagery we have
01:51:03 of like older like pop culture isn't really worth keeping because it's kind of like.
01:51:10 Like it kind of like stamp.
01:51:12 It kind of like pushes a very like races or bad narrative
01:51:15 because there's like certain kind of like characters that pop up in the book
01:51:18 because it's like, oh, it's all pieces of fiction.
01:51:21 And it's like, oh, yeah.
01:51:22 And then he has like Fu Manchu as one of the bad guys in the first book.
01:51:26 And it's like, oh, boy.
01:51:27 And yeah, it's a lot of it's a good book, but it's oh, boy.
01:51:31 Speaking, speaking of being base and progressive,
01:51:35 I went to a I went to a protest march rally this week.
01:51:41 Actually, actually, Munchy invited me to come with him.
01:51:44 He alerted me this was going on.
01:51:47 There was a shooting.
01:51:47 There was a police, a quote unquote police involved shooting.
01:51:51 If you know what I mean, a student at UMass
01:51:56 who was cutting himself with a knife.
01:52:00 So like and like cops showed up and he like fled from them
01:52:04 and they pursued him and like cornered him and they say that he lunged at them.
01:52:10 But they who knows if that's true, but they did shoot him and he died.
01:52:16 So it's just assisted dying, you know, it's actually progressive.
01:52:20 If you think they were giving him a hand, they could see he was trying to do
01:52:23 something like, hey, hey, hey, buddy, hey, buddy.
01:52:26 Nina, Nina, help, need a little help.
01:52:28 Cops are terrible and much stronger than cops are terrible at helping you
01:52:33 in any way, except for killing yourself.
01:52:35 They're like, good at that's like the only good at it's like, it's like, OK,
01:52:39 I don't know. I just kind of think that, you know, yes, this guy was having a crisis
01:52:43 and he was cutting himself and he had a knife.
01:52:45 And I kind of think that probably it was likely that nobody would have died
01:52:50 if some dudes with guns hadn't like pulled up in a squad car and been like,
01:52:53 freeze, motherfucker, you get the fuck over here.
01:52:57 You know, I feel like that probably exacerbated the situation.
01:53:01 And maybe he would not have perished if not for it.
01:53:04 But we but we'll never know.
01:53:06 So we will never know it's impossible to know it is impossible.
01:53:09 No, we can only speculate.
01:53:11 So we did we did a little march and we yelled we got the, you know,
01:53:16 that's that's what went up in front of the police station, held up a big
01:53:19 portrait of him and said, pop cops, we're not fond of you.
01:53:24 We did it.
01:53:25 You said we said, hey, on why we wish you would research.
01:53:29 We wish you would reconsider your methods.
01:53:32 And then we left.
01:53:35 And that was it. There was.
01:53:38 I just reminded myself, there is this.
01:53:41 Weird YouTuber.
01:53:42 I don't remember his name.
01:53:43 He does like very dry videos, like responding to conservatives on issues
01:53:47 like gay marriage where like there's some guy would be like, well,
01:53:50 a God said this thing and I'm not anti gay.
01:53:55 I'm just anti being gay, you know, some right.
01:53:59 Yeah, yeah, of course, slimy, weasley little argument like that.
01:54:02 And he'll be like, I'm actually and he'll he'll respond with like pretty good points.
01:54:07 But like, you don't know the video, you don't have the name of this dude.
01:54:11 I could find it.
01:54:12 I it's his name's like free letters or something.
01:54:17 OK, it's very dry.
01:54:18 Like the videos are very like like low effort.
01:54:21 They're not like particularly smart or like engaging.
01:54:25 OK, it's just like background noise.
01:54:26 But one of the videos talking about gay stuff,
01:54:28 every time he mentioned gay marriage, you'd also or like or like, you know,
01:54:32 gay rights, he would say gay rights and euthanasia or assisted dying
01:54:36 or I forget the term he used because I don't know that.
01:54:40 Apparently, apparently there's a politically character.
01:54:42 Oh, is it or is it the Canadian thing made of medical assistance in dying?
01:54:47 Is that it? I don't know.
01:54:48 I don't know. But like the video was about gay rights
01:54:50 and the guy who's responding to is about gay rights.
01:54:52 Like, see, this is why I don't like it when you say this thing
01:54:55 about gay rights and assisted suicide.
01:54:57 And he would always like add and assisted suicide
01:55:00 every single time he mentioned gay rights and it was weird.
01:55:03 I'm like, what does this video have to do with that?
01:55:05 And also also, why aren't you mentioning the issues
01:55:09 with assisted suicide being a thing under capitalism
01:55:13 where people would be pressured into any of their lives over their
01:55:16 like medical bills and other shit in recent like months?
01:55:19 I've seen I've seen it talked about that, like, I guess there was a thing
01:55:23 in Canada was doing, yeah, like, like the Canadian government was giving,
01:55:29 like, yeah, assistance, suicide assistance to people.
01:55:32 And like some people were saying they were like pressuring people,
01:55:36 like poor people into committing suicide.
01:55:38 That was the story I was I was seeing.
01:55:40 I don't I haven't really looked into it.
01:55:42 But that's just the word on the street and the grapevine.
01:55:45 That's what I mean.
01:55:47 I mean, I have to take these memories of a grain of salt
01:55:49 because it is my parents who are very conservative.
01:55:52 But like when my dad like spoke out against what would like
01:55:56 because me and my dad used to drive me places and we'd just talk about
01:55:59 philosophy and ethics and other stuff.
01:56:00 And he was a pretty smart guy on most things.
01:56:04 Like the stuff he would always mention is like, yeah, like the issue
01:56:07 with it is that like usually when it's being implemented in countries,
01:56:11 like they they'll have like all these safeguards and stuff to make to try
01:56:14 and prevent, you know, people who are poor or people who are just like,
01:56:18 you know, who are suffering because of like, you know, like poverty
01:56:22 or like because of like medical bills or everything, like they'll try
01:56:25 and not have doctors sell you that as the cheaper alternative to getting
01:56:29 like, you know, cured and how that at least according to him,
01:56:34 how that usually doesn't work and it usually gets out of hand.
01:56:38 Like like in fury, like it's a good thing, but like in practice,
01:56:41 it doesn't usually work out.
01:56:42 And you're talking about it was the suicide.
01:56:44 Yes, it's a suicide.
01:56:45 So I at the time I figured, oh, well, it's just universally bad.
01:56:49 And I realized, oh, well, most of the problems with it are probably due to capitalism.
01:56:54 Yeah, but like, you know, like I wouldn't want that in America
01:56:59 right now where if someone's like, oh, do you want $50,000 of medical debt
01:57:03 or you can just kill yourself?
01:57:04 Like I wouldn't want to, I would want to, you know, between the two issues
01:57:09 to solve there, I'd rather solve the debt problem than just to be like,
01:57:12 ah, nah, nah, nah, bro.
01:57:14 Just just like, yeah, but I don't know.
01:57:18 I thought it was weird that this video just kept mentioning that
01:57:20 in conjunction with gay rights.
01:57:22 So this is this is the guy who was supposedly he like someone else
01:57:25 was being like anti gay.
01:57:27 And this was a guy who was trying to be like pro gay,
01:57:29 but he kept like mentioning the suicide of the why.
01:57:32 Yeah, why?
01:57:33 I don't I don't get it was just out of what I feel like subliminal messages.
01:57:39 What's that?
01:57:40 I'm like, it's really important that gay people are allowed to be gay
01:57:45 and also kill themselves and also you're allowed to kill yourself.
01:57:48 And they can also kill themselves.
01:57:50 Them specifically for gay people to be able to do that and and serve.
01:57:54 I want I just I love gay people and that's why I want them to be able
01:57:58 to serve in the military and kill themselves.
01:58:01 And that's it, nothing else.
01:58:05 I want those two rights for them and no others, please.
01:58:11 Amazing.
01:58:13 Well, yeah, very mysterious, very baffling.
01:58:16 What's was that kind of one video that kind of someone uploaded
01:58:20 at the start of like the BLM protests like two years ago
01:58:23 where this guy was like screaming and yelling and he seemed to be pro BLM.
01:58:29 But he's unironically said like, yeah, yeah, like, you know, all,
01:58:32 you know, like, you know, Black Lives do matter, you know, like it doesn't
01:58:35 matter what race you are.
01:58:36 We all could like be a stupid N word with a hard R and people were like,
01:58:39 whoa, whoa, what the fuck?
01:58:41 Ha, ha, ha, ha.
01:58:42 You thought he was being you thought he was cool, but then he fooled you.
01:58:45 Well, he has he has the right energy.
01:58:48 His language just isn't it gives it appropriate, buddy.
01:58:51 Sure.
01:58:52 You like you like black people, but that's very nice.
01:58:56 Oh, oh, hot dog.
01:58:58 Oh, all right.
01:59:00 I'm going to get canceled and like I have not seen.
01:59:02 I've not seen the video in question.
01:59:04 I don't think I'm going to get him.
01:59:06 Daphne is going to mention this podcast in the cheesy takedown video.
01:59:10 Well, he fucking better.
01:59:12 He's going to be like, oh, yeah.
01:59:13 Yeah, we need the views.
01:59:15 If Daphne. Yeah.
01:59:16 Yeah, like, please, please, please cancel us, Daphne, please.
01:59:20 If he if he wanted to cancel you,
01:59:23 he would probably say Cheesy Manfredo is
01:59:28 evil because he made a comic that says that famous people on Twitter are bad.
01:59:32 And I'm a famous person on Twitter and I'm a big Twitter artist.
01:59:35 And he was a jerk and he said rich people are bad
01:59:38 and people with lots of followers are bad and that offended me.
01:59:43 And that would be his main complaint about you, I think.
01:59:46 That's epic in my in my opinion.
01:59:49 He Cheesy said the Galway was pretty cute.
01:59:54 But I said it was cute.
01:59:56 He said it was cute.
01:59:56 Pretty kawaii. It's but it's racist.
01:59:59 So is Cheesy racism?
02:00:01 Is Cheesy saying that racism is cute?
02:00:03 I don't think so.
02:00:04 And then he's going to get like I, Daphne, and actually against racism.
02:00:07 You're going to get like a black content creator,
02:00:09 a black content creator to read like a quote against me.
02:00:13 He's going to get like Barrett Barrettist Joe or something.
02:00:17 He's going to he's going to he's going to he's going to message me
02:00:20 on Discord to be like, Hey, Ben, can I talk to you real quick?
02:00:23 Can I record you? OK, cool.
02:00:24 Hey, what do you think about Cheesy and all say, Oh, Cheesy?
02:00:27 Yeah, I gave that guy.
02:00:28 I gave that guy 800 bucks to have that comic made and he still hasn't made it.
02:00:32 And he'll say, OK, great, got it.
02:00:34 Oh, oh, oh, she's so scam artist.
02:00:38 She's she's a thief.
02:00:39 She's a demon. She's a she's a monster.
02:00:42 Oh, God. Yeah.
02:00:44 No, it's not my fault. It's social media. It's been destroying my mind.
02:00:51 And the only the only cure is if I get if I get a hundred K followers,
02:00:55 that's the only cure that will fix it. I swear.
02:00:58 There's a hundred. I'll be good.
02:01:01 The saddest thing that I have had to witness recently is
02:01:06 that guy on Twitter, the guy, the autistic guy who is obsessed with
02:01:10 yours six girlfriends being blue Simpsons ninjas.
02:01:14 No, sexy and for free.
02:01:16 You know what I'm talking about? Ben Hughes. Ben Hughes.
02:01:19 He has lately he keeps posting about like how upset he is that he fell under 10,000 followers.
02:01:25 Like he's really bothered about it.
02:01:27 And he keeps posting like, help me.
02:01:30 I'm under like, please get me over 10 and I'm like, ah,
02:01:33 I just hate seeing it every single time.
02:01:36 You should every painful each one of those posts where you saw like,
02:01:39 come on, guys, let's get this guy up back.
02:01:41 Let's get him back to 10 K guys.
02:01:43 What's this? What's his handle?
02:01:45 It's been Ben Hughes something.
02:01:49 Oh, I found it recently.
02:01:51 So sending Ben Hughes to one of my other.
02:01:52 How do you spell Hughes?
02:01:54 H-U-G-H-E-S.
02:01:56 All the bends on Twitter.
02:01:58 Oh, yes. We can't trust them.
02:02:00 I think maybe maybe it's not maybe it's just S.
02:02:02 Huggies. Yeah.
02:02:07 Here, here, I found him.
02:02:08 Oh, I don't follow him.
02:02:09 I'm doing my part.
02:02:11 I followed you. There we go.
02:02:15 Ben Hugg 264-22354.
02:02:20 Yeah, buddy, you already got you already got nine K.
02:02:22 Dude, you're good.
02:02:23 He was over 10 K for a while.
02:02:25 And then I guess, you know,
02:02:27 bot accounts being deleted or whatever.
02:02:29 Well, yeah, he's only at like nine nine nine point eight now.
02:02:33 And he hates it.
02:02:35 Well, well, he's so close.
02:02:36 Well, Ben Hughes, just fucking.
02:02:38 How about you just update your fucking content
02:02:40 as you're posting the same joke over and over again?
02:02:43 You're so epic and cool, dude.
02:02:45 This guy, he's barely getting like 50.
02:02:48 He's getting like under 50 likes on all this guy is epic and cool.
02:02:51 And yes, I love that he posted the same joke over and over again.
02:02:54 And it's not a joke.
02:02:55 It's not a joke.
02:02:56 It's a sincere appreciation of yours.
02:02:59 Six wives, if he's so epic.
02:03:01 Why does he have 10 K?
02:03:04 Yeah, it's true.
02:03:04 As I thought, I don't know.
02:03:06 I don't know why Ben Hughes says,
02:03:08 I'll keep focusing on the Simpsons females E.R.
02:03:10 and all the prehistoric animals.
02:03:12 So he's staying the course.
02:03:14 He's not changing up his content to fit the the album.
02:03:19 Fucking Raven follows him.
02:03:21 Damn, Revin, we're going to follow me back.
02:03:22 I saw Raven.
02:03:24 Yeah, Raven did some ninja fan art.
02:03:27 Right.
02:03:28 We're going to follow me back.
02:03:29 I literally agree with everything you say.
02:03:31 I love your comics.
02:03:32 Was it something I said?
02:03:34 Was it something I said?
02:03:36 Was it something I said?
02:03:38 Big Twitter artist.
02:03:39 She was offended.
02:03:41 They they she's she's a big they.
02:03:43 Yeah, they they go by day them.
02:03:45 They are they were offended.
02:03:47 But because they're big and they're bigger than you.
02:03:49 It's going to change.
02:03:50 You can't go saying that.
02:03:51 It's going to change once Mimi already drops extra souls.
02:03:55 Raven's going to be like, oh, written by cheese.
02:03:57 Manfredo will give.
02:03:58 Oh, give follow.
02:03:59 Oh, executive produced by Ben St.
02:04:02 Does it mean wait?
02:04:03 Wait, they follow you already, don't they?
02:04:06 I think they did.
02:04:07 And then they like purge their their follows.
02:04:09 And I don't think they follow me anymore.
02:04:10 Oh, oh, no.
02:04:12 Yeah.
02:04:12 That was like a while ago.
02:04:14 Well, look at bummer.
02:04:15 Let's see who follows Ben.
02:04:17 Well, Juniper follows you.
02:04:19 Juniper does follow me.
02:04:21 I'm not exactly sure why, but I appreciate it.
02:04:23 Wait, which which Juniper?
02:04:25 The one that invented the worm.
02:04:27 Yeah, the goblin mode.
02:04:28 Yeah.
02:04:29 What?
02:04:31 Do you DM Juniper and be like, yo, this cheesy Manfredo guy, pretty base.
02:04:35 The person who literally invented, well, popularized the term goblin mode.
02:04:41 Juniper is like the final boss of Twitter.
02:04:45 I was like the ultimate poster.
02:04:47 The only Juniper I know is the Moffy Tuber, who has a cool Eldritch Moff character.
02:04:53 If you don't know Juniper, then I'm sorry, but you just don't have it in your NGMI.
02:04:57 The majority of the people, the majority of the people that follow you.
02:05:00 Juniper is one of those weird names.
02:05:01 It's probably a tree.
02:05:03 I think it is.
02:05:04 Oh, I just got reminded looking at your follower account.
02:05:09 A Stereo's Coconut is going to have me on on his live stream in March.
02:05:14 I was on a Stereo's live stream.
02:05:16 I saw Stereo's Coconut.
02:05:18 You did a good job.
02:05:19 I educated him on the history of that guy with the glasses.
02:05:23 A Stereo's.
02:05:24 Like, so back in, I think back in November, I gave him a Stereo's and I tell him,
02:05:30 hey, a Stereo's, do you know about the Blueie fandom?
02:05:33 Like the adult Blueie fandom that's growing.
02:05:36 And he's all like, no, so good.
02:05:38 I said, no, tell me.
02:05:39 You tell me.
02:05:40 He's like, no, tell me more.
02:05:42 Well, I basically explained to I gave like a brief summary of what the Blueie adult
02:05:46 fandom is like, because I like Blueie.
02:05:52 Yeah, but but my partner is a massive, massive Blueie head.
02:05:57 Actually, they were like on the ground floor when the when the fandom first started
02:06:01 like two years ago.
02:06:03 Jesus.
02:06:05 Yeah, two years ago.
02:06:05 It started.
02:06:07 So I've been witnessing firsthand like the Blueie phenomenon like right here
02:06:12 in my bedroom.
02:06:14 That's sickening.
02:06:15 That's sickening.
02:06:16 I hate it.
02:06:16 No, no, look, look, look, it's fine.
02:06:20 It's not fine.
02:06:22 It's Ben.
02:06:22 Ben can't imagine Ben.
02:06:24 Can imagine imagine being into a show for little kids like imagine.
02:06:29 Imagine like I'm sorry, an adult.
02:06:32 I'm sorry, a fandom, a group of people that come together around shared
02:06:36 appreciation for a cartoon for children.
02:06:38 What is society?
02:06:41 What is happening to society?
02:06:42 You know, back in my day, this wouldn't have happened back in my day.
02:06:45 You know what we would do if we found out that someone was into a little kid show?
02:06:49 Mm hmm.
02:06:50 Oh, yeah, we draft them.
02:06:51 We would send them to Nam.
02:06:52 We tie him, tie him, tie him to the back of a car and we just and we just go to
02:06:56 town, just hit the gas.
02:06:58 Australians, a loving family.
02:07:00 I could never support such a thing as Ben.
02:07:03 So I sent that to a stereo's back in November.
02:07:07 The stereo's did not reply into two months later.
02:07:10 Oh, and out of out of nowhere, he replies and says, hello.
02:07:14 Yeah, I'm going to read for all this now.
02:07:16 Oh, wow, this sounds great.
02:07:17 You want to come on my live stream?
02:07:19 Let's talk about it.
02:07:20 And I'm like, yeah, sure.
02:07:21 I'm down.
02:07:22 And then, um, yeah, so we set a date.
02:07:25 It's going to be like in March.
02:07:26 Um, he added me about when the date is going to be.
02:07:30 Um, I know everyone's going to forget the date because this is like in fucking March.
02:07:36 Most most PCP fans forget everything they heard once they're done with an episode.
02:07:41 Mm hmm.
02:07:42 Yeah, real dummies.
02:07:43 Those guys, real, real, real little funny fellas.
02:07:46 Okay.
02:07:46 March 26, March 26, like at seven p.m.
02:07:53 East coast time, I think.
02:07:55 All right.
02:07:55 Well, reminding.
02:07:57 Yeah, I won't remember.
02:07:59 He says live stream with the clown fucking guy.
02:08:01 That's me in case the clown fucking guy.
02:08:04 Yeah, that's about right.
02:08:07 After after McPuglatchy, um, I'm going to double down on that that like monster.
02:08:13 You're going to be double that.
02:08:14 Yeah, double down to clown.
02:08:16 Double down to clown.
02:08:17 I actually have, I actually had a genius idea for another clown porn comic.
02:08:22 And oh my God.
02:08:24 Now, is that going to be clown milk too?
02:08:25 I still have to, there's still a couple of things in the background.
02:08:28 I have to fix up.
02:08:30 There's a couple of lives.
02:08:31 I, there's a couple of friendships and lives that have to rebuild in the background.
02:08:36 You have to ruin to get to get that back to get that ship running again.
02:08:41 I had an idea for a clown porn that would have just been a solo comic.
02:08:47 Um, then I could make a joke about being like, I only make two types of clown
02:08:51 found comics like serious comics and porn.
02:08:55 That's the two genres of clowns for me.
02:08:58 Um, that's going to be out.
02:09:00 I don't fucking know when, but I am going to double down on the monster manual.
02:09:05 Did I tell you about that?
02:09:07 But the, the monster, the gimmick was like, oh, this is a monster.
02:09:11 The monster manual for a video game that doesn't exist.
02:09:14 Like, oh, yeah, you might have mentioned that before.
02:09:18 Yeah.
02:09:18 Like, like we were going to, we're going to be like, yo, we, uh, we built a machine
02:09:22 that pulled out this monster manual for what would have been a Super Nintendo
02:09:26 game at the game.
02:09:28 The game doesn't exist in our reality, but we have the monster manual.
02:09:31 And I've been kind of like thinking about it like slowly, like, oh, maybe I
02:09:35 should, I, I'm going to try to do some like, uh, Super Nintendo research to see
02:09:39 like, what are the limits of the system to see how accurate we could get?
02:09:43 Like our like monster manual would be to an actual video game.
02:09:47 Right.
02:09:48 Yeah.
02:09:48 Yeah.
02:09:49 Yeah.
02:09:49 Interesting.
02:09:50 I think, I think people will, will dig, will dig that.
02:09:52 It seems like enough.
02:09:54 And I'm going to do with a, okay.
02:09:56 I was, I was, I was talking, talking to my friend, uh, Dwoob yesterday about
02:10:01 this artist called, um, Alex Dejan or Deegan.
02:10:06 Do you know who that is?
02:10:07 You ever, you ever heard of Alex Dejan?
02:10:09 Alex Dejan, D E G E N.
02:10:13 Um, he, he made a comic called, uh, soft X-ray mind hunters and he
02:10:20 sometimes works with, uh, the catamites, which is who is the guy who made
02:10:25 space funeral and he makes lots of other weird, uh, uh, indie games.
02:10:30 Um, but he, okay.
02:10:32 Soft X-ray mind hunters is like a wordless, like sci-fi, like fantasy thing
02:10:37 about these guys, like going through all these like weird, like dream
02:10:41 universes, like fine, they have to, they have to hunt down these brains
02:10:44 and like destroy them basically.
02:10:45 Oh, this looks cool.
02:10:47 It's really cool.
02:10:48 But he all, okay.
02:10:49 He, he does, uh, he's done a bunch of things that are, what you just said
02:10:52 reminds me of them.
02:10:53 They'll, he has another book called, uh, I think it's called the Martian War
02:10:57 library and the Martian War library is, it's not really a comic.
02:11:02 It's a book of, they're drawings of like magazine covers or like comic book
02:11:09 covers and there's no comic.
02:11:11 There's just the covers, but it's just a series of covers of what is presumably
02:11:15 an in-universe comic and there sort of is a story that's told like through the
02:11:19 progression of the covers of these comics that don't exist about this character
02:11:23 card Martian called Martian War.
02:11:25 Yeah.
02:11:26 And, um, that's cool.
02:11:27 Doob showed me another, uh, older book of his that I'd never seen before
02:11:31 yesterday and it was, um, it was a similar thing.
02:11:34 It was just illustrations of these like, it was like a team of like, uh, child
02:11:39 sleuth geniuses doing like solving crimes and like finding mummies and stuff.
02:11:44 And it was like, just like sort of a, not really like a story, just like a
02:11:50 series of images depicting these characters in this, in scenes.
02:11:56 That's, that's really cool.
02:11:58 Yeah, he's good.
02:11:59 He's soft.
02:12:01 I think I've probably talked about soft x-ray mind hunters at least once
02:12:04 before, but it's a really good comic and it's, and it's big.
02:12:07 It's a big book and it's quite long and wordless and the illustrations are really
02:12:12 nice.
02:12:13 Yeah, that's, um, I, I've been, um, I've been like, I just, I haven't bought it.
02:12:19 I only maybe bought two new comics like last year because I've been so
02:12:24 focused on working and also I, I got into a very expensive hobby, which is
02:12:31 um, action figures, but buying a lot of those, like a little, like a little
02:12:35 fucking man child.
02:12:36 But, um, it is very, I've been, um, yeah.
02:12:40 Man, chill, chill.
02:12:42 It is very man-shilderness, but like the, the, the, the star fire, the fire star
02:12:47 figure that I have just like activates a sexual urge inside of me so I can't,
02:12:52 can't help myself when I look at it, right?
02:12:56 Yeah, this looks really cool.
02:12:57 I like this a lot.
02:12:59 I'm reminded about like, I, I kind of have like a, um, for the monster manual
02:13:04 we're doing, I'm actually working on it with, uh, my buddy, uh, Kizuchu, who's
02:13:10 in your, oh, Kizuchu, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:13:13 Yeah.
02:13:13 He's a, he's a cool dude.
02:13:14 Um, I love, I love him to death.
02:13:17 Um, and his, his art style is like this.
02:13:19 This is like, this is like the first piece he made this year.
02:13:21 It's really good.
02:13:23 Let me see.
02:13:25 That's good.
02:13:25 Oh yeah.
02:13:26 He's a, he's a really good artist.
02:13:28 He, he, it's me and him.
02:13:29 I like the woman.
02:13:30 We're, we're kind of doing this thing.
02:13:32 I like the woman.
02:13:34 It looks cool.
02:13:35 And, and our, and our private, we have like a private server for the monster
02:13:39 manual or just me and him.
02:13:40 And what we do is we just kind of throw designs into like a chat and then it's
02:13:45 like, Oh, what do you think of this?
02:13:45 Oh, what do you think of this?
02:13:46 And then we just kind of go back and forth or like it was just any idea I have.
02:13:50 I just throw it in there.
02:13:51 Like, I just come up with a name like, Oh, what about a gloopity gloop?
02:13:54 And then he's like, all right.
02:13:56 And then he just draws a design based on that name or he gives me a name and I
02:13:59 draw it and we go back and forth.
02:14:01 Um, the only problem is, and like, look, don't get me wrong.
02:14:04 I love Kazoo.
02:14:05 I've had him.
02:14:06 He's like my co-host on like five different podcasts.
02:14:10 I didn't know that.
02:14:11 Cause, cause you, cause you is just, oh, cause you takes like, like decades to draw
02:14:16 one picture.
02:14:18 Oh, that's a bummer.
02:14:19 That is his one flaw.
02:14:20 If he could fix this flaw, he would, he could become God.
02:14:23 He could become a big Twitter artist.
02:14:26 Um, if he, if he fixed this one, one flaw, um, but it's, it's okay.
02:14:32 Cause I'm going to, I'm going to whip him into shape.
02:14:34 Sometimes I have that same problem.
02:14:36 And actually it's my number one problem.
02:14:39 The thing is that you guys don't have like deadlines.
02:14:44 You don't have, I do.
02:14:47 Yeah.
02:14:47 You don't, you don't have like time limits where like, oh, if I don't do this by
02:14:51 now, I might become homeless or, uh, no, I have, I have, I have a deadline of if
02:14:56 I don't do this, I'll have wasted my life.
02:14:59 Uh, but the time, the timeline is pretty generous on that one.
02:15:03 Um, oh, Ben, have you seen your life in weeks?
02:15:06 No.
02:15:08 Oh, get ready for a dread.
02:15:10 Jesus.
02:15:12 Did you know that you spend 100% of your life being stupid?
02:15:17 Is that what it is?
02:15:18 Do you know that, you know that every second of every hour you're inhaling air that
02:15:24 is touching another man's cock?
02:15:26 Oh, did you know that?
02:15:30 Did you, I, I didn't.
02:15:32 Did you know that your body is comprised of molecules that once were farted by somebody?
02:15:39 Somebody farted you.
02:15:42 Ew, probably.
02:15:43 That's gross.
02:15:45 Yeah.
02:15:45 Oh, no.
02:15:48 Oh, God.
02:15:50 What's the life in weeks?
02:15:51 Oh, I've seen something like this before.
02:15:52 Each one of these is a week.
02:15:53 What is this?
02:15:54 That's how many weeks you'll live, probably.
02:15:56 Uh, that's, that's, that's my result with my birthday put in.
02:16:02 I don't, I don't.
02:16:03 It's my birthday next week, which is why it's right about to complete a row.
02:16:07 At least a little bit there is like five years.
02:16:11 Each line is a year.
02:16:15 Well, here's mine.
02:16:20 Are you, is the, is the non red space is that, um, like how much time you got left?
02:16:26 That's like, that's like expected life expectancy.
02:16:30 It's fucking over.
02:16:31 I'm good.
02:16:32 I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna crank out like villain verse chapter 500 by then.
02:16:37 Good.
02:16:38 So like age zero to like 15, basically you're not real.
02:16:44 Yeah, I could get to like villain verse chapter.
02:16:46 You can change it to months too.
02:16:47 If you click on weeks, you can select months.
02:16:50 I don't know about you guys.
02:16:51 Uh, this doesn't, this doesn't apply to me.
02:16:55 It's gonna, cheesy man, Fredo library is going to be pretty big by then.
02:17:01 Damn big library.
02:17:02 I just got to, you just got to put out every, every single one of these boxes.
02:17:06 Put out a new chapter and, uh, damn, that's like, it's not that many.
02:17:13 Oh no, it's not that many.
02:17:15 It's not that many boxes.
02:17:17 There's a lot of boxes.
02:17:18 Not try counting them with your hand.
02:17:21 Not that many boxes.
02:17:23 You try counting each of these boxes with your hand.
02:17:25 You'll run out of fingers.
02:17:29 Oh my God.
02:17:30 You know, you know what I, what I like to do is seven days with multiple
02:17:34 millions of seconds, not millions boxes anymore.
02:17:38 I've had enough.
02:17:39 Frankly, I've had enough.
02:17:40 You know what, you know what I like to do?
02:17:41 You know what I like to do when I complete a project?
02:17:44 I like to, I haven't actually done this before.
02:17:47 This is the first time I'm doing this and this is going to give me my dread is I
02:17:51 will highlight how much time I spent mucking around on the last project.
02:17:56 Um, so, so this is, this is my life in months.
02:17:59 The yellow squares is how much I spent working on the animation that I just finished.
02:18:04 Oh, such a big chunk of my life on one loop.
02:18:08 Oh my, oh my God.
02:18:09 I don't, oh, I can, I'm thinking about it.
02:18:16 I'm thinking about.
02:18:17 Imagine these as like, like, um, like time, like a bus health bars.
02:18:23 Like, yeah, like, uh, like all the zelda hearts.
02:18:27 Hey, you got a lot of them.
02:18:29 Got a lot to go.
02:18:30 I'm looking at like time that I spent working on like slime and punishment.
02:18:35 That's like way too many of these boxes.
02:18:37 There's all the years I wasted with my bitch of a wife.
02:18:41 Exactly.
02:18:42 All the fucking years I wasted on that bitch.
02:18:44 More like every single one of these red boxes a year that I wasted on my bitch
02:18:48 of a life in my opinion.
02:18:51 I gave that whore the best years of my life.
02:18:55 Well, it's been, it's been more than a decade since my little pony
02:19:00 came out.
02:19:05 Yeah, like a, oh my God.
02:19:07 Yeah, like, like a quarter of these boxes are post MLP.
02:19:12 Scary.
02:19:14 Well, no, a third, more like a third.
02:19:15 Yeah.
02:19:17 Although I didn't get into it until it was several years old.
02:19:19 So I don't know.
02:19:21 Well, um, fuck it.
02:19:25 Oh, that's the podcast everyone buy.
02:19:28 No, I don't know.
02:19:29 I'm making it worse.
02:19:30 I'm making it worse for myself to moralize.
02:19:32 I'm not letting you know how I'm just working at Pennsylvania.
02:19:36 Just make stuff.
02:19:37 Just make stuff guys.
02:19:38 No, shut up.
02:19:40 No, I won't.
02:19:41 No, I won't make.
02:19:42 I'm making.
02:19:42 Oh, I don't know.
02:19:43 I can't make things.
02:19:45 So hard.
02:19:46 I can make things and I want to say at least like one thing in this whole
02:19:50 podcast because like every topic has been like, oh, I don't care about that.
02:19:54 I'm sure.
02:19:55 I'm sure.
02:19:55 I'm sure.
02:19:56 I'm sure our audience feels the same way.
02:19:58 Every topic.
02:19:58 Oh, I don't care about that.
02:20:01 Now I know how they feel.
02:20:02 Yeah.
02:20:04 But I have been productive on the Clarissa stuff and I'm sticking to my
02:20:11 pace.
02:20:11 I'm getting a I did a calculation.
02:20:16 I did nine pages finished.
02:20:18 They were already aligned.
02:20:19 I was doing the shading.
02:20:20 So this week last week.
02:20:22 Yeah.
02:20:22 Nine pages and I have 10 left for this chapter.
02:20:26 So maybe the end of February beginning of March chapter four of Clarissa
02:20:31 gun smoke will be done and then the perfect comic party issue one will be
02:20:36 soon after assuming that there's other stuff to put in there.
02:20:42 And I did a calculation.
02:20:43 I did a calculation based off just like my my current like slow ish pace of
02:20:52 like doing line art and then doing shading.
02:20:55 It will take me roughly for a 20 page chapter of a thing about three weeks
02:21:03 from doing all that stuff.
02:21:07 And then that's assuming that I keep the pace I was currently at and that I
02:21:12 don't have any major setbacks or like bad days.
02:21:15 So like probably like four weeks is a good estimate for how long it will
02:21:20 take to get a chapter done.
02:21:22 So I'm on and I have 10 chapters of Clarissa overall.
02:21:27 I'm on chapter four.
02:21:29 So in six months it'll be done.
02:21:34 That's my that's the whole thing like all 200 pages 208 pages.
02:21:39 Yeah.
02:21:39 It's a lot.
02:21:40 That's cool.
02:21:40 That is a lot.
02:21:41 That's I'm very bad at I'm very bad at condensing my story into small normal
02:21:46 amounts of stuff.
02:21:47 But it's going to be good.
02:21:49 It's going to be very good.
02:21:50 I'm rooting for you.
02:21:51 Yeah.
02:21:52 Thanks.
02:21:54 Yeah.
02:21:54 You need to pump that Schmidt out.
02:21:58 I got I feel I feel more.
02:22:01 I don't know capable of of just being just to just do the work.
02:22:08 Just got to keep you got to keep the pace that you know you can you can
02:22:11 match so that you don't like freak out when you're doing fine.
02:22:16 Yeah.
02:22:17 Because like if you if you get some work done you're like oh shit I could
02:22:20 have done like seven times that much work.
02:22:22 And in reality you could not have done seven times as much work.
02:22:26 Don't worry about it.
02:22:27 You're doing fine.
02:22:27 Just keep just keep going.
02:22:28 And it's like it's it's good.
02:22:30 Right.
02:22:30 If you're if you're making progress then it's like OK just keep keep doing
02:22:35 what you're doing.
02:22:36 You're doing it right.
02:22:39 Did I.
02:22:39 Okay.
02:22:40 Apparently I can't remember what I talked about last week.
02:22:43 Did I say last week that I had sent my files of slime and punishment
02:22:47 to the printer that that would happen.
02:22:49 Yeah you did.
02:22:51 Yeah.
02:22:52 Okay well now I won't mention thank you.
02:22:54 Thank you.
02:22:54 I won't mention it again.
02:22:55 All right.
02:22:56 No problem.
02:22:58 Give if I could if I could just if I could just ask for one request.
02:23:05 I need you to to make the carrier the characters look wackier to be wackier.
02:23:11 They're not wacky wackier.
02:23:13 They look a more goofier.
02:23:14 Make them I think you should.
02:23:15 Yeah.
02:23:16 I think maybe you should just start over and make them wackier.
02:23:20 I mean look I don't disagree.
02:23:22 I think I struggle.
02:23:25 I struggle a bit with like oh it's got to be good.
02:23:28 So I have to be an anatomically correct which means I can't do this pose.
02:23:32 That's too wacky and then some of the sketches some of the drawings are like
02:23:37 end up kind of lame like kind of stuff you like look look everyone everyone
02:23:42 who I'm so surprised when I when I find out about a one piece fan and then I
02:23:46 look at their work and I'm like are you not taking the lessons from one piece
02:23:51 where it's like just characters are just wacky or like or even like something
02:23:56 like in Iraqi's logic with like characters just having weird poses
02:24:00 because like being weird is just more memorable than being like neutral or what
02:24:06 not.
02:24:06 You're just I mean I don't think I'm going necessarily for a one piece look.
02:24:11 I don't you should I definitely want to should have and yeah I agree.
02:24:15 Wackier characters but like singles for Ben I don't know I like I like subtle
02:24:20 stuff like like peanuts like Charles M. Schultz like the way he does like
02:24:25 extremely subtle expressions Charlie Brown being like depressed in a very
02:24:30 specific way and it's like yeah like there's only a tiny little flicks of
02:24:35 ink that make you feel like that particular way and when you look at it
02:24:39 okay but where is the I like subtlety where's the where's the Charlie Brown
02:24:44 gift shop and Tokyo Universal Studios.
02:24:48 Oh wait that's not there.
02:24:49 Oh there's a one piece gift shop.
02:24:50 No you can't answer that.
02:24:52 Can you you fake fan.
02:24:55 Look they put that goes for you too.
02:24:57 You got to make your character the wackier.
02:25:00 Um yeah.
02:25:03 Okay yeah it's not wacky enough.
02:25:05 I'm I'm not as wacky as people expect.
02:25:10 Phantom had some wacky expressions like in Simon punishment.
02:25:13 He had some for some wacky panels.
02:25:15 Sometimes you just have to like draw characters with just one foot in the
02:25:19 air and every time you see them they just have one foot in the air for no
02:25:22 reason I've never explained why but it's just memorable.
02:25:25 Is that a Jojo thing.
02:25:27 It's just like the thing just a thing people do.
02:25:31 What one foot in the air.
02:25:33 He's got he's got he's got to be goofy goofy.
02:25:36 Oh what I'm imagining right now is saying to you with his foot like
02:25:38 fully upwards 180 degrees looking at smoking a cigarette or cool.
02:25:43 I want everyone a lollipop you mean I want everyone to look in the mirror
02:25:47 and say say to themselves I got to get goofier.
02:25:50 I just got to get silly.
02:25:51 Look no no no I see what you're doing now you're trying to clown us.
02:25:55 You're trying to make us turn you just to put on the makeup.
02:25:57 That's not true.
02:25:59 That's not true.
02:26:01 But I see why I see what's speaking of which it wouldn't hurt.
02:26:05 Cheesy just wants us to put on clown makeup.
02:26:07 So does he can fucks us.
02:26:10 What's no look I see you.
02:26:12 I see your game.
02:26:14 Look look give me speaking of which you have you know it wouldn't it wouldn't
02:26:17 hurt to put on some more color maybe some more makeup and your big red
02:26:20 nose foundation.
02:26:22 Some red some red nose selfies wouldn't hurt.
02:26:24 Tease the hair dot tease that hair out into a big fro diet some wacky colors
02:26:29 and Ben Ben I hear that I hear if you really want your teeth to glow.
02:26:34 Astrogen is pretty good with that.
02:26:36 I heard like taking astrogen is pretty helps you glow it more and really big
02:26:43 shoes really really really big shoes and filled with estrogen.
02:26:48 You know I hear you know you know you know like a lot of people think breast
02:26:52 implants are expensive but not really and I hear they're pretty affordable
02:26:56 and the area you live in you know just saying just saying and they're not
02:26:59 just for women anymore.
02:27:01 They're there for everyone.
02:27:02 It's for everybody especially especially guys who take HRT.
02:27:07 Yeah true true yeah.
02:27:12 I hear you know I know it's a little it's a little hyperbolic but yeah my some
02:27:17 of my character designs are like stiffer and like more reserved than they
02:27:21 should be.
02:27:22 Yeah I still like Clarissa I like how her hat is like stupid hat but it's like
02:27:26 it's just a symbol of a cowboy hat.
02:27:29 Not and she's she's but she's like really cool though.
02:27:33 That's that's you know that's drawing comics though right isn't it just
02:27:37 like the more of it you draw you just like how push push the characters push
02:27:42 him more and more to be like you know wacky your poses exaggerated poses
02:27:47 you exaggerate them more and when it's a process you work push it you always
02:27:52 push in it push it funny doofy you know right and then I have I have a
02:28:01 thing I have one another thing that I wanted to mention this episode which
02:28:04 is I just wanted to mention that the radcon for dojin is done the dojin
02:28:10 the dojin is done the OVA is not done Nate is supposedly done almost he's
02:28:17 he's about seven or eight times now he said it's going to be done soon I
02:28:21 promise it's going to be done soon I'm definitely going to get it done this
02:28:24 month and then he's just a totally ignored it every single time but maybe
02:28:29 this time he means it for real and yeah the dojin is done and I have the
02:28:34 copy I have the PDF of it and one of these days when the OVA is done I'll
02:28:39 release it and it looks really great and everybody did a really great job
02:28:44 and I especially was impressed with Drinking Moth who did a lot of pages and
02:28:48 a lot of big like full-page spreads and they were really good and really quick
02:28:53 Drinking Moth like fucking got all these pages done and like got them done in
02:28:58 like a day like they were so good was so impressed yeah shoutouts to Drinking
02:29:05 Moth in particular I still need to commission Drinking Moth everyone
02:29:10 should commission Drinking Moth I really I can't recommend her enough honestly
02:29:14 I wanted to do the the the picture for the League of Nate fuckers voicemail
02:29:19 compilation that I said I was gonna do like a year ago oh yeah yeah yeah it's
02:29:25 great and also was there there's there's a there's three pages from new new did

02:29:38 I think it was there was there is there someone I'm forgetting give am I
02:29:44 forgetting anyone to help I don't know I can't remember I'll probably think oh

02:29:57 yeah a bunch a bunch of them were from Ed yeah yeah that traitor that turncoat
02:30:03 maybe it's time I finally follow Drinking Moth back I think you should

02:30:21 more content you know I'm looking at this oh this is the months I've been alive

02:30:30 about the the the the the finitude the the the smallness of the world and the
02:30:35 life is just a bunch of dots on a page and there's so many of them already
02:30:40 filled but like that's right if you turn those little circles there into like
02:30:44 grapes you wouldn't be able to eat all those grapes it's actually quite a lot
02:30:49 it's actually a lot a lot more grapes than you would you'd think never would

02:33:14 experience of one piece one of my friends his name was Christopher Hall I'm
02:33:19 calling him out he's autistic more often than me which is on a ball he tried to
02:33:26 get me into one piece he showed me the first episode I don't remember if it was
02:33:29 dubbed in English or not and I didn't like it and based on that I will condemn
02:33:34 everything you know what the show is bad don't watch the show except I know
02:33:38 that's what that's what everyone's always said yes I mean it's no I disagree I
02:33:42 think the show is cool I watched every episode up to like episode 300 I did I
02:33:49 did too but I was like a child I was like 14 when I watched the show yeah and
02:33:53 children know children are the future I used to be one and then I got over it
02:33:59 I'm never gonna watch the show I'm gonna stick to the manga sorry I'm sorry you
02:34:07 can read you can read the manga in half the time it takes to watch the show it's
02:34:10 art isn't about how quickly you get to the end yes it is I just yes the baby's
02:34:17 shoes never worn all the best art ever done sooner equals better take I take I'm
02:34:24 gonna stick to the source material the better a work of art is the faster it
02:34:27 lets you just be done with it and get back to counting your fucking pennies
02:34:31 and investing in in your in diversifying your portfolio and in finding a high
02:34:37 interest savings account to put your your money in okay that's what it's about
02:34:42 the manga is good I would prefer the manga it's just that the anime has a
02:34:47 really good soundtrack and sound design and like I can't imagine knowing one
02:34:53 piece I can't imagine really knowing and one piece without knowing the sounds and
02:34:59 the voices and the music of the specific moments where it's like super
02:35:03 emotional it's like yeah it's all in my head damn Gino Gino 7 should do a video
02:35:09 on the sound design of the one-piece anime one piece how it looks a little
02:35:14 goofy so that's I know right isn't it great they have multiple sounds in one
02:35:22 piece where's my cool emo edgy boy protagonist huh that's law you're a law
02:35:28 boy man shut up is there a boy for me in one piece yes there's a guy who's his
02:35:34 name is law and he wears a hat law Trafalgar D law and he wears a hat just
02:35:39 like that pickup artist mystery and he has tattoo knuckles and a big sword he

02:36:46 our face she's got that when I was a kid I got playing my face I feel she's got
02:36:53 got that walk in her when I was a kid my favorite character was raising from
02:36:57 zoids I thought he was the coolest boy he's so emo that guy's got dust hair
02:37:03 that's a dust hair if I ever seen it real zoid head in in the call right now
02:37:09 yo zoid I I don't I don't think it holds up I don't think zoids holds up but
02:37:15 when I was a kid I want to talk about it I vaguely remember when I got cable I'm
02:37:21 like wait a minute oblivion you've got to read or and I'll watch one piece there's
02:37:27 so many girls in there I would definitely read it over watch it I'm not
02:37:33 watching a show that long it's too much I've already watching Detective Conan and
02:37:36 that's taking years that's that's now that I'm sorry how can you how can you
02:37:43 judge how you sit on your high horse and judge reading one piece when you're
02:37:48 literally watching Conan literally watching Conan I would say I would argue
02:37:55 you know why I'm watching somewhere there's actually a good reason
02:37:59 we're gonna leave it unless you can read oh my god she's amazing it's boss
02:38:04 it's his boss and a sonia you gotta she's on ironically really pretty and I'm not
02:38:09 saying that as a meme however if there's a one-piece waifu she's it for me I I do
02:38:15 appreciate that at a certain point Oda seemed to commit to making wackier
02:38:20 women he did not do it for a long time but then at some point he was like okay
02:38:25 I'll do it always but there is actually a very good reason to read sorry to watch
02:38:32 Detective Conan over read it and that's because the English translation is
02:38:35 utter dog shit when Funimation localized Detective Conan they changed it to
02:38:42 case closed that's yes I don't know why Detective Conan is already an English
02:38:47 title for the show I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest I'm when I hear detective
02:38:51 just the name Conan all I can give is Conan the barbarian it does not conjure
02:38:56 images like a genius child the offer Sherlock Holmes that's what I'm right
02:39:03 Conan O'Brien that's just not where that's just not what I think I don't know
02:39:06 that's maybe that's just not well ignoring that only did they change the
02:39:11 title they also changed Shinji's name to Jimmy Jimmy Kudo they changed his
02:39:18 names to like English names yeah they they made now it's in America it's not
02:39:24 Japan it's America which doesn't make any sense they did that to a phoenix right
02:39:28 and I love that game so like what's the problem the problem is that it doesn't
02:39:33 make any fucking sense because the fact that they're in Japan is extremely
02:39:36 important to like a lot of the stuff that happens the American police do get
02:39:42 involved and that's like a whole plot point and that makes no sense they just
02:39:46 fucked a bunch of shit up and all the official like English translations use
02:39:51 that for some reason and it's really dumb and I don't like it and the show
02:39:57 does that and also the show adds a whole bunch of extra like stories that are
02:40:01 also really good so I don't I'm sorry all that you just said those were like
02:40:07 complaints against the English dub right yes but you like the end the stuff
02:40:13 from the English dub was also put into the English translation of the manga as
02:40:17 well I see they did that to the manga too and I am just like why why would they
02:40:23 do that I I don't I don't know that's just what they it's real it's really
02:40:29 funny how for like a while there like they couldn't just have an anime be in
02:40:36 Japan they had to make it like about America they had to change it yeah which
02:40:41 is weird because I'm going up in the area they said in America they couldn't
02:40:46 have them eating rice they had to pretend they were donuts or fruit
02:40:49 sandwiches or whatever and it's just like why I think it would have been okay I
02:40:55 think you could have just said yeah these guys are Japanese and they're
02:40:58 eating rice it's normal what if my child asks me about what is bacon and they
02:41:04 they they learn about rice what is that weird oriental food you that's me an
02:41:10 American parent mm-hmm you're right and I was being being Japanese is woke well
02:41:19 I think yeah I I think it's woke being Japanese the Japanese gender I have to I
02:41:29 have to use the bathrooms you got can I you guys might what I could I could I
02:41:34 interest you in letting me use the bathroom no I'm gonna I'm gonna go back
02:41:40 my pants a little does he know that I diarrhea dumped in his toilet and now
02:41:48 it's blocked I diarrhea dumped in his ear when he was asleep and you didn't
02:41:53 even notice I diarrhea it out my butt which is where it comes from I should
02:42:01 also mention that the reason I'm watching Detective Conan is because it's
02:42:04 Kai's favorite series of all time and he's sharing it with me that's the other
02:42:10 reason I probably wouldn't watch it if I was if it weren't yeah like genuinely
02:42:15 when people say oh I can't get into X media it's so long I'm like shut up what
02:42:23 the fuck are you gonna do with that time oh you're complaining you got more of a
02:42:27 good thing oh you people don't actually go for bite-sized entertainment they
02:42:32 just like are intimidated by something that they can get invested in I don't
02:42:36 know why I just don't get it for me it's because there are so so so many shows
02:42:43 that I do want to see in my lifetime and I have a finite amount of time on earth
02:42:47 and I don't have the the did you borrow spirit of being able to watch fucking
02:42:51 everything I don't have that luxury so shows that are shorter I can watch more
02:42:58 of them and get more unique experiences out of that it's just I don't relate I
02:43:07 don't relate to feeling like I need to see everything or even that many things
02:43:12 I personally lists of movies and TV shows I've heard are great it's like oh I
02:43:17 should probably watch Scarface at some point like I've heard that reference so
02:43:20 much maybe like I should watch the film yeah but like I'd rather not every day
02:43:25 I say that I would I would prefer if someone could make a list of okay like
02:43:33 here like here of a list of detected Conan episodes that are actually like
02:43:37 relevant to like the main story and like here are like from the ones that aren't
02:43:43 relative related to the main story or introducing characters who will become
02:43:47 important later which you know like like the only grabbing like the top 10% of
02:43:52 the best mysteries to include so that way instead of having to watch a thousand
02:43:56 episodes only have to watch like 200 or something or maybe two or 300 like I
02:44:01 would probably prefer that experience because then because there are point
02:44:05 there are like some episodes that are just like okay that mystery was kind of
02:44:08 boring and predictable and but then there'll be like episodes like anime
02:44:13 original episodes that have some of like the best mysteries in the entire show
02:44:16 that are like super engaging and clever and I'm like holy shit how did they come
02:44:19 up with that murder and that like alibi and that like method and all this shit
02:44:23 and it's like really fucking crazy like cool stuff that they come up with
02:44:28 sometimes and you know what's our anime original episodes do a lot of good
02:44:34 stuff with that sometimes so I wouldn't want to just do the ones from the
02:44:38 demand you know what's a really good show I got into and me and me and my
02:44:45 buddies in my private server we uh we started watching a Colombo and it's a
02:44:52 really it's a really good a show is that detective man yeah and you know like
02:44:59 the general premise of it um no but I've seen his face I think I know what he
02:45:04 looks it's it's really it's really interesting cuz cuz the type of
02:45:08 mystery is they do the so you the the most common kind of mystery is the who
02:45:12 done it right like you know that's like the default usually right but Colombo
02:45:16 instead is the it's a type of genre called how you catch him is what it's
02:45:22 called and what it means is that at the start of every episode of Colombo we see
02:45:27 that we know who the killer is and we see them commit the crime and every
02:45:31 little thing they do to make sure they don't get caught like they always have
02:45:34 like every little like thing like like figured out like they always like think
02:45:39 twice they like get rid of evidence and they're like oh I did it I committed the
02:45:43 perfect murder that's always like the the first first third of every episode of
02:45:48 Colombo is the murderer we see them we know their name and everything and
02:45:52 they're committing the crime and they're getting away with it like I did it and
02:45:56 then and then but then the premise of the episode is like what is Colombo
02:46:00 the detective gonna figure out to solve the mystery and it's like so fucking
02:46:05 it's like so fucking interesting you know it's an ironically like a shonen
02:46:10 battle it's like because like both both sides are trying to like the killer is
02:46:15 trying to like like kind of like get the better of Colombo like oh Colombo
02:46:20 Colombo isn't gonna figure out this bit cuz I free I like I cleaned it up or
02:46:24 like in the spot I came up with the perfect liar I have an awesome alibi and
02:46:27 Colombo and Colombo's whole gist is that he kind of seems like kind of like
02:46:31 he's like kind of messy looking he's like really short and he and he always
02:46:36 seems to be asking like questions that are kind of stupid right or he starts
02:46:40 talking about his wife which is like his catchphrase and um but eventually
02:46:45 Colombo figures out like a small detail that connects everything else and in the
02:46:49 end he kind of like reveals the bombshell like oh well this is how you
02:46:52 did it and then and then the then the killer like what what Nani and then the
02:46:57 episode ends and it's and it's really fun it's so fucking awesome he also the
02:47:02 majority of the killers are like are rich people are like they're the ones who
02:47:07 are usually killing people and it's it almost becomes kind of like this like
02:47:10 class thing where like Colombo is like I don't know I kind of hero Colombo he's
02:47:17 working class hero even though he's a cop he's a working class hero and he
02:47:20 always kind of like gets the better of these like rich fucks who think they're
02:47:23 so smart and he's all like I don't know but my wife told me you're the killer
02:47:27 and that's basically every episode really the secret clue that put it all
02:47:31 together my wife had a dream she saw it in a vision I and and every episode is
02:47:37 like a movie it's like I like I think the original the first episode was
02:47:40 actually a TV movie but like people liked it so much they ordered a pilot
02:47:45 which was the second episode and every episode took an hour long but it's
02:47:49 really good love it big Colombo I can I can definitely say there's a lot of
02:47:56 like Detective Conan like it's not every it's not like every episode so who
02:48:00 done it that's like half of them but there's a lot of episodes that are like
02:48:03 we know who did it or like we we can very like one person is very obviously
02:48:08 suspicious but like it seems impossible like they were somewhere else they were
02:48:12 like sometimes so like they were on a plane like flying somewhere else at the
02:48:16 time of the murder how the fuck did they like pull it off like they change for
02:48:20 time of death did they or it's like in like locked room you know and like they
02:48:25 were somewhere else like and how did they pull that off how to if they
02:48:28 committed the murder they would have had to have locked the room but we can't
02:48:30 prove how they would have done it so we have to figure out the method and it's
02:48:34 really fucking good sometimes like some of the shit and like they teach you real
02:48:39 skills that you can use to murder people IRL I remember I saw a couple
02:48:44 episodes of case closed and I literally like never realized that Jimmy is like
02:48:51 an adult that's been transmogrified I thought he was just a kid and like it
02:48:55 like never came up that he is like magic child that's the whole that's the whole
02:49:01 like running plot is that he's trying to figure out who are the people who
02:49:05 behind making him into a child I know but it just never it just never came up
02:49:08 I still don't know I genuinely believe that that will never ever be solved like
02:49:15 that it's I don't know it's it's sort of like the most annoying compelling thing
02:49:21 to get you to read on cuz I'd like I like I like mysteries but you know you can
02:49:28 get tired of like and he's just solving the mystery again like there's only so
02:49:31 many types of mystery you can do and you know it could get boring but there's
02:49:37 that that hook when is he gonna find out who turned him into a baby when is he
02:49:43 gonna get the information never never will he get it but always really want
02:49:48 to see I can confirm that's not true we found out a lot of stuff about the
02:49:54 organization and who made the drug organization 13 yeah organization
02:49:59 because it made a black organization because they're their outfits were
02:50:05 designed by Nomura you see yes yes yeah all comes together and my wife had a
02:50:12 dream about it do you know that guy you know that like there's like an American
02:50:15 congressman who like literally posts on Twitter about how like his wife had a
02:50:19 frickin like vision from God and her dreams or whatever there's a real this
02:50:24 is a real good I think it might be clay Higgins I think it might be
02:50:27 representative clay Higgins like his wife had a fucking vision and is a
02:50:32 prophet of the Lord and that's why I don't know that's why I deserve to be
02:50:37 reelected that's why we have to raise taxes on that farm supplements or
02:50:42 something this is why we need to raise the price of gravel the gouging is on
02:50:51 gravel these tariffs on gravel my business fucking gravel gravel's fucking
02:50:57 killing me I gotta be groveling for my gravel I got a big old gravel for your
02:51:02 right here I got a big old gravel for your dairy air I don't understand what's
02:51:13 happening yeah Colombo Colombo based recommend watch it it's on to be for
02:51:21 free I wish Colombo would tell me what the fuck any of you are fucking talking
02:51:26 about because it was just about and but as I was going to feed the cats I had
02:51:30 something about a congressman having a vision from God or something yeah yeah
02:51:34 yeah this this guy named rep I think it's rep rep clay Higgins and like he's
02:51:38 occasionally posted on Twitter about how like his wife has yeah these like
02:51:43 prophetic like God dreams that like foretell the future and stuff God it's
02:51:49 awesome you know you know what flight of a Concord's first recently for the
02:51:54 first time there's that episode with the guy at the fruit stand who's super
02:51:57 racist against New Zealanders he's played by Aziz I'm sorry yeah yeah it sounds
02:52:04 like a name he would have based on his visual appearance I'm racist I can I
02:52:12 could say that cuz he's a fellow brown brother like me yeah he was in like he
02:52:17 was in like parks and rec yeah yeah he got like canceled for a millisecond but
02:52:24 it was only because apparently I forget the details but people kept saying that
02:52:29 like oh it was just because like this woman had sex with him and I don't like
02:52:35 that very much that was upsetting cancelable behavior in 2023 yeah not
02:52:45 anymore not anymore I'm sorry that's that's fucked up we can't allow this
02:52:49 it's over it's I'm sorry you took it too far we have to roll we have to start
02:52:53 rolling back we have to go back because you had sex with one of them
02:52:58 this is a plan rolling back rolling back women's rights rolling JK rolling
02:53:04 rolling back rolling rolling rock rolling rock on the rolling rocker yeah rolling
02:53:11 rock on the rolling rocker could not fucking believe it I made a tweet like a
02:53:22 couple weeks ago where I said that a best case scenario Universal Studios just
02:53:28 buys the rights of Harry Potter off JK Rowan but not now in retrospect I don't
02:53:33 really think that's gonna happen because like it probably only happened if it
02:53:36 gets to the point where like the JK Rowan herself has like decreased the
02:53:41 profits of the franchise and I think to a certain extent she has I don't think
02:53:47 it's like enough enough you know it might not know yeah we haven't gotten to
02:53:52 that point yet where it's like only it's only been increasing because as the
02:53:57 people who grew up with the films start getting incomes they start being
02:54:01 becoming you know man children about it and they're like oh I love Harry Potter
02:54:06 I remember that and now they're all buying like Harry Potter stuff as an
02:54:10 adult it's yes with the whole Hogwarts legacy thing it's like moments like
02:54:17 this that make me realize that like you spend too much time on Twitter you start
02:54:22 thinking like this is something everybody knows but it's not really true
02:54:25 because I'm on Instagram where I mostly follow like close people who live in my
02:54:30 city they're playing the Hogwarts game and like they don't know nothing about the
02:54:35 JK Rowan like shit or yeah I would like post most people don't care to the
02:54:41 average person and I and I and honestly I sympathize I do it's like to the
02:54:44 average person it's like that's a political debate and I don't even want
02:54:51 to look at it I have not I'm not gonna take any position at anything that's
02:54:55 politics and this is a video game and I and I and I do not want to don't
02:55:01 acknowledge that those have anything to do with each other I'm just here to play
02:55:04 a video game I kind of get it I don't I don't like it but I understand this is
02:55:09 that it's like I don't want to engage with the takes about this I just want to
02:55:14 consume product this is why yeah in a couple of months I'm going to drop my
02:55:20 video called I prove every story is political with just one chart and I
02:55:28 have a chart that like proves everything is political interesting what does it
02:55:33 chart like politics over yeah it's a it's a it's a Prager you a graph that's
02:55:39 like the axes are unlabeled it's just like politics versus time and the arrow
02:55:44 just goes out politics so they acknowledge that politics is relative
02:55:50 that's relativism which is Marxism which is if society agreed that killing
02:55:56 babies was good then it would be good because that's relativism and leftist
02:56:00 want to kill babies I agree that's that's for I didn't agree with anything
02:56:06 until you said kill babies yes I love killing babies also I believe politics is
02:56:13 relative a woman driving in a car in a video game isn't political unless you
02:56:18 live in Saudi Arabia hmm okay I'll I'll tell you I'll tell you this I kind of
02:56:25 like I like go down to like the core of what what politics is and what and like
02:56:31 forget ideology like forget left or right don't that's not even what I'm
02:56:35 talking about politics is ultimately just like how society functions that's all
02:56:40 what politics is right hmm and this chart like that I have I'm gonna post it
02:56:47 here like kind of like you could like you could like fit stories into this
02:56:54 chart like and not just in the squares but in between squares hmm right has
02:57:00 just been updated since the last time you showed me no it has not I've been too
02:57:04 busy I don't think I've seen this before okay but I'll explain what I mean so
02:57:08 like like the top says blatant so that's what I first of all you spelled
02:57:14 preserve wrong okay who cares I'm gonna roast you for that alright whatever
02:57:20 who cares I yeah English is the colonizers language I don't care anyway
02:57:27 at the top we have blatant so that's when like a story is like obviously
02:57:32 political so either it's like the main character is like the president or
02:57:36 something or the main character works in like some sort of political body then
02:57:41 oh yeah obviously it's political cuz someone is like you know working in the
02:57:46 system itself story about politics right and then at the bottom is like subtle
02:57:51 so it's like when like no one in the story works with anything political at
02:57:56 all you know they're just like people or they're like abstractions of people or
02:58:01 whatever you know and left and right we have state power and then non-state
02:58:08 power and you know there we have like preserve like preserving state power and
02:58:13 on the right we have changing you know with like non-state power this is like
02:58:19 politics is downstream from from culture or vice versa sort of yeah so so so at
02:58:27 the so for and the biggest way to figure out what could fit in this chart is
02:58:30 like pick a story and like think about does society change by the end of the
02:58:37 story if the if society does not change then it's like it's in the preserved
02:58:45 section so like by the stuff like it by the start of the story if the government
02:58:49 or everything that functions around it is the same it's on the it's on the left
02:58:52 side I'm thinking about I'm thinking about Harry Potter right and then and then
02:58:57 on the on the on the right side right like if society well it's no no forget
02:59:03 forget for you know it's not there's no ideologies here like forget left or
02:59:06 right politics yeah there's no there's no ideology so like for example what it you
02:59:11 know what would be all the way at the at the top at the top left side where it's
02:59:15 like blatant a blatant preserving and and like state power would be a movie like
02:59:21 Independence Day right because all the characters all the major characters
02:59:25 work in the governmental body and the and the bad guys don't necessarily have
02:59:31 an ideology they're just aliens they're just a force who wants to change our
02:59:35 world right and we want to preserve our we want to preserve America so at the
02:59:40 start of the movie America exists and at the end of the movie America still
02:59:43 exist nothing change right we have preserved society that's like yeah right
02:59:49 and at the at the top right corner where it's like and that's good yeah sure
02:59:54 depends on you and well and at the top way at the top right corner where it's
02:59:58 like blatant and like changing society and like it would be kind of like non
03:00:03 state power we would have something like one piece where there's like people
03:00:07 actively changing society like society's gonna change once we get to the one
03:00:11 piece right probably probably but also state power will probably change I feel
03:00:18 like I feel like the like an artwork can be put in many of these different
03:00:23 zones see that's that's the beautiful thing though that's a beautiful thing
03:00:27 about this because like every every one of these stories I mentioned could be
03:00:30 debated on so like nothing is permanently like like stuck in one place
03:00:34 well I yeah I don't think it's like one place or another I just think it some
03:00:40 things can be multiple places like the main characters are trying to change
03:00:46 society and then they like like overall like yeah exactly like where to put my
03:00:50 little pony well okay does equestria people change you is where I is where I
03:00:56 put my little pony okay you're also changing the community and preserving
03:01:01 Ponyville from attacks Twilight became a princess that's a that's an increase in
03:01:05 state power yeah it's like individual equestria equestria exists at the start
03:01:11 right there's still a monarchy at the start of the series and there's still a
03:01:15 monarchy at the end of the series right yes I would so my little pony is more
03:01:20 episodic so it'll be closer to the center which is the status quo zone and
03:01:24 that's mostly that's mostly reserved for like episodic like superhero media or
03:01:29 like sitcoms they're all in the status quo zone nothing ever like it's always
03:01:33 just everything's kind of the same nothing changes right like that's where
03:01:37 the majority of like just super so by this charts logic is that non political
03:01:44 when nothing just nothing changes well I think the idea is that it's still
03:01:49 political status quo it's all political if a story if a story takes place in a
03:01:56 society it is political by the fault right yeah and like and the care and the
03:02:04 characters just kind of like because like the characters doing nothing about the
03:02:08 politics it's still like a commentary on politics itself right you know sure sure
03:02:14 right so like yeah unconsciously perhaps but yeah yeah when it's like subtle
03:02:20 when they're like because I mean you might say it's kind of more blatant in my
03:02:24 little pointy because she's training to become a princess which is a person in a
03:02:27 position of power right hmm well she doesn't even train to be well she kind
03:02:33 of trains to be a princess or ultimate friendship lessons ultimately she
03:02:39 becomes a princess and she kind of like escapes the like well if he's a
03:02:44 princess it's some sort of monarchy right sort of like it's honestly more
03:02:48 like a divine appointment than it is like a hereditary monarchy okay familiar
03:02:54 you are like real monarchs you you can like well as long as like the divine
03:02:59 monarchy has some sort of like kind of state power you know like the princess
03:03:03 implies there's a state power or something right you know mm-hmm there's
03:03:10 parades there's cantaloupe there's lots of this guards castles I think I'm I
03:03:16 think like if I were to kind of like be more kind of like try to like keep things
03:03:20 simple I think the top left would be kind of like people preserving society I
03:03:27 mean it says right there like top right like it's people like kind of changing
03:03:31 society and the bottom is more like society is changing you right or like
03:03:38 yeah like you know society changes your society keeps you the same you know and
03:03:42 that's what those are more reserved for more like kind of psychological stories
03:03:46 or stuff that's like a character you know society society also gazes into you
03:03:52 yeah like like at the bottom like probably at the bottom I would put
03:03:57 something like taxi driver where the character of Travis Bickel like ultimately
03:04:01 stays the same because society has kept them the same you know because he does
03:04:06 this giant action where he fucking goes into a brothel and starts shooting up
03:04:10 people and he basically committed a massacre and but the thing is the fact
03:04:14 that he since he killed what society deems the right people who deserve to
03:04:18 die he's considered a hero so he's like his his terrible actions are justified
03:04:24 so he stays in this he stays in this state and you know and it's kind of like
03:04:28 all like all of this is very obvious if you've seen taxi driver because the final
03:04:32 scene it's looking if we have it is that everyone here seen taxi driver I have
03:04:37 not seen taxi driver oh it's a 10 out of 10 it's a it's I mean I've heard I've
03:04:41 heard people talk about it it is the best in taxi driver and I will watch it so
03:04:46 it's the best crazy white boy movie ever of all time like don't know they're
03:04:51 crazy crazy like like that movie is the reason why I love crazy white boys is
03:04:54 that movie and I'm we fucking turn it in a fight Travis Bickle or Patrick
03:05:00 Bateman probably Patrick Bateman to be honest because he's because he's in
03:05:05 better shape because he does a thousand crunches every morning he's it he has
03:05:08 more experience but no one will believe him Travis Bickle is like sloppy you
03:05:14 know and you know also like also American Psycho could probably go like
03:05:18 here at the bottom where his name is Patrick Bateman okay unless unless his
03:05:23 actual name is a what's the other guy Patrick Bateman wait wait don't they say
03:05:27 in the movie wait Patrick you're the American Psycho they call me American
03:05:31 Psycho in the movie I remember Jared Lito calls him like Patrick you're the
03:05:36 American Psycho he says that I don't think that's true there's a part in the
03:05:41 movie where he's mostly Patrick Bateman but sometimes there's another name for
03:05:44 another guy that sometimes it's like he killed that guy but then other times like
03:05:48 he's like people call him that name like he might actually be that guy that he
03:05:52 thinks he killed like so like at the like at the start of American Psycho
03:05:56 like Patrick doesn't change like he just kind of just stays the same ultimately
03:06:00 because the society that he's around himself has kept them the same so he
03:06:04 would be like at the bottom left you know is that political is that really a
03:06:11 measure what it's saying it's the fact that he's being kept the same says
03:06:15 something about like society right just it's all I'm saying I'm gonna I'm gonna
03:06:24 eventually like really when I do the video every one of these squares is
03:06:29 gonna have a movie or like a story there so people are gonna have like a better
03:06:32 like idea what I'm talking about okay well I'll watch it do you like it do
03:06:38 you think it's interesting do you think I'm onto something I am not sure you have
03:06:43 to convince me you don't have to give me more examples and maybe lay out a full
03:06:47 case not gonna lie I haven't I haven't seen this chart in like months and I'm
03:06:53 just pulling out
03:06:56 well give just stepped out I was about to suggest voice going to voicemails since
03:07:08 we've been going for like three hours now unless I don't know unless there's
03:07:14 anything else he has one chat about I I want to briefly promote my animation
03:07:22 that I finished of my character oh yeah yeah yeah my character failure with her
03:07:28 big floppy tits right funny put in a penis between her tits and flopping it

03:07:40 okay wow here I was getting excited here I pulled out my dick cuz I was about to
03:07:44 jerk it and you're you're like oh it's on your patreon never mind yeah it's it's

03:08:04 oblivion I'm just gonna say it now you haven't you haven't made it until like
03:08:08 your animations appear on a tiktok um come zone has appeared in tiktoks like
03:08:15 the audio yeah there's this current like tiktok meme going where it's like
03:08:20 that it's like clip from SpongeBob where he's watching like the CNM and then
03:08:24 Gary comes in and he and he changes the channel to football because he doesn't
03:08:29 watch yeah yeah so so the meme is that it's like and it's like it a bit of the
03:08:34 it's like the animated porn right before they get down to the fucking and then
03:08:38 like Gary comes in and SpongeBob changes it once your animations appear in that
03:08:41 oblivion you made it I could do that right now I could make that oh yeah that's
03:08:48 not you can't do yourself that's that's just doesn't have doesn't have to do
03:08:50 yourself all right there've been times where I've gone to 4chan like on to D
03:08:54 look for a cool boob porn and they'll be a Fred like a hot succubus women and
03:09:01 I'll just see my character in there every so often yeah that's happened three or
03:09:07 four times no sorry two or three times oh wow there they go oh wow they're
03:09:11 undulating I'm looking I'm looking at the video you sent me I think I've seen
03:09:16 you working on this animation I didn't I don't where's where's my link I don't
03:09:22 see it I'll send I'll send you cheese huh I'm currently so never there's a
03:09:30 fluid Elliot that is a fluid flop that they got there that is smooth mm-hmm and
03:09:38 shiny is how I would describe this you know speaking of 4chan I was notified a
03:09:47 while ago that last Halloween there was a thread or maybe two Halloweens ago
03:09:54 there was a thread that used punk as like a as a like a little Halloween thread
03:10:01 and there wasn't mentioned who punk was or what she was from they just pretty
03:10:06 sure yeah I'm pretty sure the person who made the thread knows cuz the fact they
03:10:10 know from they had like bail jpeg gifts and stuff but then people like oh this
03:10:15 is a cool is a cute little Halloween mascot and they sort of adopted her and
03:10:19 then people started drawing her I was like oh hell yeah wait do you have so
03:10:24 nobody knows it's me but they're just they're just enjoying the character
03:10:27 design that's really nice can you share some of the art that was made if you

03:10:39 put it epic this is cool I'm gonna put some on me thank you yeah and I titled
03:10:48 them and on cuz I don't know who made them that's really cool I am someone
03:10:55 noticed someone notified me that some people have posted my comics on the on
03:11:03 4chan specifically the if you guys see my Akira bike slide comic that I made yeah
03:11:10 yeah yeah I got posted apparently these are funny oh my god oh sorry it's a lot
03:11:22 of that in the middle oh my god these are these are cool I love these are you

03:11:55 don't know bail shape it's just really nice cuz it's like yeah character
03:12:00 design that's I did I did a little character and I resonated people that's
03:12:04 pretty cute that's pretty cute hmm hmm you love to see it give everything to go
03:12:15 to voicemails I feel like we're getting to that point before that had did you
03:12:20 read the one-piece chapter no you fool no no no well what do you want to do do
03:12:34 you want to do first I want to skip it I don't want to skip it I don't want to do
03:12:38 I mean I don't know we got guess we can't be rude rude to read I don't know I
03:12:42 don't know what a one no no I mean like not with them I mean like that's why like
03:12:46 after the voicemails like the show ends then we talk about one piece well I
03:12:52 guess we could do that yeah yeah you could continue after voicemails I could
03:12:57 say bye and you could keep the episode going for five hour mark I mean I hate I
03:13:01 hate to kick hate to kick a blivvian fall off if you don't kick me off Kai's
03:13:05 gonna kick me off you'll be like you're being on the podcast too long I want to
03:13:08 be loud in the living room that's fair that's reasonable okay I mean we could
03:13:15 do that yeah sure all right voice voicemails now and then one piece after
03:13:20 I guess sure all right so the first voicemail is it's a link to a YouTube
03:13:26 video and it's just called moon stuff and it's this just video of a guy on the
03:13:34 moon oh this is me I saw you can you can disregard the audio and just send a link
03:13:40 since I'm already here I explain it the comics the comments are turned off cuz
03:13:46 everyone's like oh it's fake yeah so so this was a few episodes ago then you
03:13:54 were talking about you know wait did we did we ever go back to the moon and the
03:13:59 answer is yes we did and we took a better cameras wait I mean I did I say
03:14:05 that cuz like I know we went to the moon several times I know we didn't just go
03:14:09 the one time oh did you mean like after the first like burst of missions was
03:14:13 there like another one yeah like um we want to I know we went a bunch of times
03:14:19 but like we kind of just haven't been doing it in a while cuz like there's
03:14:24 not really anything to like get on the moon there's not a whole lot humans can
03:14:28 do but I'm so freaky with a completely black sky I love it I love it you bring
03:14:34 that up cuz I remember I was talking to a co-worker and I told the co-worker
03:14:38 that like like yeah I'm like anti conspiracy theory like I really do the
03:14:43 majority conspiracy theories are like incredibly fucking bullshit and stupid
03:14:47 and he's all like oh so you actually believe we we went on the moon and I'm
03:14:51 like yeah of course we went on the fucking moon and he's all like oh yeah how can
03:14:55 we never went back and I'm like there's no fucking resources why would the
03:14:57 fuck would we go back there's nothing to okay when you send a robot to the moon
03:15:02 you can fold it up into a cramped space it doesn't need a life support system it
03:15:06 doesn't need room to move around and stretch its muscles and breathe it
03:15:08 doesn't need food it doesn't need water you don't have to like basically like
03:15:13 for human habitation especially you know usually they send a couple people
03:15:17 at a time because it's you know better that way you're gonna have to like
03:15:23 does the size of the craft have to be like five or six times bigger and five or six
03:15:27 times heavier which means for rocket needs to have like five or six times more fuel
03:15:32 because the fuel to payload ratio isn't something you can just sidestep
03:15:36 like a bigger payload means more fuel but then the fuel also adds more weight so
03:15:40 you need even more fuel and it just becomes ridiculous for Saturn 5 rocket was
03:15:44 fucking gigantic we don't usually use rockets that big because they cost billions of
03:15:48 dollars per launch so basically I told my co-worker all of that that Oblivion just
03:15:52 said I told that to my co-worker and he was fucking stunned and he fell on the ground
03:15:57 and then everyone clapped also also Ben you mentioned parabolic arcs I want you to watch
03:16:04 this footage of the lunar rover whenever you see dust kicked up behind it notice how
03:16:08 there's no it doesn't swirl around like it would an air like the dust particle is just
03:16:14 like fall out follow a parabolic arc and like fall straight to the ground
03:16:18 let me uh let me they don't linger in the the way air does
03:16:22 it's like halfway through driving towards the camera
03:16:26 they kind of just yeah it kind of just kicks up in these like little waveforms behind the tire
03:16:32 and then just falls straight up and then down and up and then down yeah yeah they don't linger
03:16:37 because they don't there's no air for them to hang in there's no air and they also accelerate
03:16:41 towards the ground too if you're I mean the camera's moving quite a bit but like if you're able to
03:16:45 catch so often when you see at the ground it actually speeds up quite a bit before hitting
03:16:50 the ground because it just accelerates the whole time yeah which wouldn't happen in air
03:16:54 dust particles are tiny they basically have air resistance basically completely
03:16:58 overwhelm some you can't do that without filming in a vacuum and because of the low gravity you
03:17:03 would also have to film it basically have a high speed camera spilled it spilled it film it at like
03:17:11 90 frames per second which we didn't have 90 frame per second cameras that could record for like
03:17:17 10 20 minutes or hours at a time back then that that technology in exhaust high speed cameras
03:17:24 could only record for about 90 seconds which would be we'll start for like for for 30 seconds
03:17:29 which would be 90 seconds after you slowed it down but if that's the case then the dust makes
03:17:34 even less sense because that would be the dust moving in slow motion which dust the dust would
03:17:39 have had to be moving three times faster than that which it definitely wouldn't do if there was air
03:17:44 so it's impossible to fake it's that's just not possible oh i see what you're saying yeah this
03:17:50 effect is just you wouldn't you wouldn't never wouldn't you just wouldn't act like that yeah i
03:17:55 saw a youtube comment i guess i turned off the comments off since then someone was saying yeah
03:17:58 this is clearly stop motion and i'm like first of all what fucking stop motion animator people
03:18:03 just say words people just fucking say words oh my god they're saying they claim that the
03:18:07 astronauts don't move and they're like oh the astronauts have stopped motion i'm like first
03:18:11 of all stop motion the 70s was janky as fuck with the animators back then just weren't as good as
03:18:16 the people we have now and that's not a technology thing that's an artist thing who did they hire
03:18:21 secondly these shots go on for like minutes at a time no stop motion person can do a shot that
03:18:26 long without making a mistake and having to start over also dust how do you do stop motion dust
03:18:32 are you fucking stupid yeah you've ever seen any fucking movie ever they never do stop motion
03:18:36 dust because it's so fucking yeah stop motion movies have only been able to have that since CGI
03:18:43 could do CGI dust over top of a stop motion movie that's like what like it does it would be interesting
03:18:48 to see like like a doctor uh no uh what's what's the guy who does the visual doctor disillusion
03:18:53 captain captain disillusion captain disillusion video about how like yeah how you couldn't fake
03:18:58 the moon landing footage there was um you know i think he's addressed that people want him to do
03:19:03 that but like he just i think he's like he's like misbusters or did it better than i ever could
03:19:08 and i think no he could do an even better job there's busters barely tap the surface there's
03:19:13 also a lot of things aside from like actual moon footage that proves the landing was real
03:19:20 and everything and i think the biggest thing i always go back to is the fact that if the moon
03:19:23 landing was fake the russians would have exposed us like right then and there because they had way
03:19:28 more shit up there and they would have they would have known right unless your logic is like oh the
03:19:33 russians are in on it too and it's like um in the middle of the fucking cold war we they weren't on
03:19:38 the same fucking side motherfucker uh yeah so they colluded to make the cold war just a just a little
03:19:44 prank that they pulled on every single other person and then you would have to believe in a bigger
03:19:48 body and then it goes into the people that like oh well you know who's secretly controlling the
03:19:51 strings and it's like bro it's it's a one world government but also fuck the middle east um they're
03:19:57 terrible and we have to kill them it's a one world government but they want globalization but we're
03:20:02 but we're already at globalization and like it's so fucking oh god i'm so fucking tired i was
03:20:07 listening to um it's yeah i was listening to the it's literally more it's more believable to just
03:20:12 be like no maybe we it would actually be simpler to believe that we just went to the moon we just
03:20:16 we just launched a rocket to the moon like it's not that far it's the grand scheme i was um i was
03:20:22 fucking listening to the cold cuts podcast with uh yellow swag and beatle moses and like
03:20:27 just the way that like i like beatle moses but i really just hate how casual he is about like
03:20:33 just believing in conspiracy theories and he's all like yeah you know i i do think the movement
03:20:37 he was fake it's just it just be so easy to fake like oh my god are you serious you fucking dude
03:20:42 like i i swear i thought you were supposed to be the smart member of this podcast yeah if you
03:20:46 know nothing about cameras or physics or anything that's that sucks oh my god i was this this just
03:20:53 this justifies every bad thing i've ever said about beatle moses uh he's a he's a cool guy he's
03:20:59 still like kind of the better half of that podcast not gonna lie oh god that doesn't
03:21:04 spill me with the confidence i mean if they're on a podcast they're already too far gone right
03:21:11 right it's too late right ellies ellies are cut out the following that i'm about to say because
03:21:16 it's kind of like some personal shit a few moments later okay all right should we go back to voicemails
03:21:22 now yeah we go back to voicemails no i have a mini topic it's really short trust me it was all right
03:21:28 okay um i was just i just i fell down the i didn't really fall down the rabbit hole i i got it i
03:21:35 saw the fucking elevator i fell into an elevator no a mini Scientology rabbit hole again i fell
03:21:43 down to a deep a few years ago learning about all the fucked up shit that Scientology does and how
03:21:48 insane and like batshit crazy the organization is and how they like attack people do you know
03:21:54 any Scientologists i actually i met one uh when i was at animation school one of my friends
03:22:01 one of my best friends at the school turned out to be a Scientologist and he was talking about
03:22:04 the South Park episode and he actually broke down into tears talking about it oh no he got bullied
03:22:09 he got bullied so much because of it and how he doesn't understand why the stuff from the
03:22:12 that they said in South Park isn't even true that was my first exposure to it i but um that
03:22:19 and then he tried to show me like some Scientology videos and it was like the very like you know
03:22:23 that corporate music where it's like all like uplifting and spiritual and it's like come join
03:22:27 our institution i watch the tanda cruel video about corporate music yes that was a good one yes
03:22:34 boba way yeah they were boba weighing in there boba way yeah yeah yeah yeah but then um i don't
03:22:40 know later i i ran out falling into that document falling into i ended up watching that documentary
03:22:45 series about Scientology and how like um all the shit about the aliens that South Park mentioned
03:22:51 is true there's recordings of L Ron Hubbard talking about it um well that's well that's the stuff
03:22:55 that like they don't tell you until you get like deeper right until you reach ot free which most
03:23:01 an average person would have to spend around 300 thousand dollars in donations to reach that level
03:23:06 fuck hell oh you think you think they're alive you think they're alive when they put like this is
03:23:10 what they actually believe and then they weren't lying every person who's ever like left Scientology
03:23:16 has like horrible like yeah like they teach you about ot free that's like standard um but uh
03:23:23 so i without getting too much into it i just i just noticed this is this is the leader of
03:23:28 Scientology david miscavige he has he has those glassy like those empty like glassy eyes that a
03:23:36 lot of like crazy like demonic like religious people is this guy ai generated no that's just
03:23:42 how he looks you know kind of copeland has it has those eyes oh my god uh the heavens gate guy also
03:23:50 has those glassy eyes okay i just noticed it these people are demons this guy looks like a comedian
03:23:56 you ever um you ever seen this guy is like leslie nielsen and uh which which guy is the comedian
03:24:01 the third guy the third yeah ben you ever seen this guy's like rodney dangerfield leslie nielsen
03:24:07 and uh who's the guy who was steve martin he's like those three people in one guy i mean i thought
03:24:12 it was pretty funny when he had all those people commit ritual suicide by drinking kool-aid pretty
03:24:18 no that wasn't him that was that was jones that wasn't heavens gate that was jones town it was
03:24:22 jones town what heavens gate was similar though it also yeah they had similar similar but you
03:24:26 ever seen the the video with that with that image come from no it's pretty it's pretty wacky um you
03:24:32 might get some inspiration heavens gate you initiation um you know what's funny is i should have painted
03:24:37 his teeth with y9 you know what's funny is that um the site where these guys committed their mass
03:24:42 suicide is like like i think i'm like an hour and a half away from there um it's pretty close by it
03:24:49 was like a it was like a like a big house in like a in the neighborhood and after they committed
03:24:54 like the act like all the neighbors like got together and bought the house and then fucking
03:24:59 demolished it because they didn't want like a couple of weirdos to come and check out the place
03:25:05 you know because of like tourist reasons or whatnot right so it's not it's technique that's
03:25:11 there but it's not because they built i think they built a new house over it um good for them yeah
03:25:17 it's uh it's wacky oh also um when they when they committed the mass suicide they were wearing a
03:25:24 specific like nike shoe and after like that mass suicide they stopped making that shoe and that
03:25:29 shoe goes for like it costs so much on fucking ebay now because they don't it's because they don't
03:25:35 sell it and you know it's infamous now yeah and suddenly consumption under capitalism was african
03:25:41 once again it just took one very funny if that was like their best shoe and they're like oh we can't
03:25:46 make it anymore we gotta make the worst shoes now damn it why people ruin everything uh uh
03:25:57 our uh shit i'm sorry i lost my train of thought what's happening what are we talking about
03:26:03 uh Scientology um oh yeah Scientology Scientology
03:26:10 demons i love demons um i love demons i am a demon i love evil i love material harm
03:26:19 i love to cause it um so uh speak voicemail yes okay the next voicemail was uh where are we
03:26:29 we got an image here we got some image posts okay we then took us that long to get through
03:26:35 one voicemail it was like an hour uh okay so this is oh my god what is the beast out of the earth
03:26:45 and then i saw the second beast coming out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb but it spoke
03:26:49 like a dragon it excites the authority the first beast on its behalf something Aurora
03:26:57 oh so like mage is the devil not the devil the the beast of the earth uh earth beast
03:27:06 guys who horns like a lamb spoke like a dragon fire to come down from heaven okay like the
03:27:14 aurora bria it deceived the inhabitants of the earth just like just like mage does every day
03:27:19 um if i can if i can six six six the number of the bitch gives hey no that's my favorite number
03:27:27 the beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast so that the image
03:27:32 could speak oh like a vtuber yes oh my god it's all holy shit yo is this is this true guys guys is
03:27:40 this true is this true i would say i can't i can't believe mage is narrow caesar slash
03:27:46 narrow on caesar six one six i could i i have i had a feeling i had a feeling
03:27:54 guys saying not that i'm shocked but not that shocked i got a feeling that mage might be the
03:28:02 devil the devil that mage might be the devil let the person who has insight calculate the
03:28:08 number of the beast for it is a number of a man that number six six six it but just dawning on me
03:28:15 how goofy that is yeah like like the number of the beast it's the calculation yes because you
03:28:22 calculate it okay so in roman this is a common thing in rome is that like you know how roman
03:28:28 numerals they're made out of letters right if you add the letters in someone's name together you can
03:28:33 get like a number um and so you know you can calculate someone's number and narrow uh like the
03:28:42 what his number was six six six um or six one six depending on if you spelled it narrow or
03:28:47 near on there are two spellings and um narrow killed a bunch of christians and they also it's
03:28:54 not just for number they also specified that the beast is just rome they say there's like seven
03:29:00 heads which are seven hills and but the tail is a river and there are this many crowns on the head
03:29:06 this many crowns came before this many crowns will be and this specific crown which if you
03:29:10 looked at how many scissors they had had up into that point that also matches up with nero
03:29:14 and all the stuff it says he's going to do is stuff that narrow did it's very much just
03:29:18 it's a guy in history i think i think it's a i think it's a hebrou thing there's this thing
03:29:23 called gematria which is just like yeah yeah it's it's he he does it as well yeah maybe maybe the
03:29:29 romans also did it uh yeah it's roman the romans had like had their version of it but like there
03:29:34 was a similar thing in hebrou as well too yeah but the number six six six and six one six comes
03:29:39 from the from that translation not the hebrou version it's it's really funny when people in
03:29:44 the modern day will try to do it with like modern english names like as if like as if like like people
03:29:51 in the bible would have like known how like the numerical gematria would work out for like the
03:29:57 english spelling in the year 2023 and it was divinely inspired yeah that's true that's also
03:30:03 true definitely god told them and all the all the stuff about this hey guys this is very obviously
03:30:08 rom because of the seven hills and the river and all this stuff just ignore all that yeah yeah
03:30:15 like it basically like explains what the metaphor is and like plain words like
03:30:21 but but uh but uh fuck it also what an image this next voicemail is um i mean you know it speaks
03:30:31 it speaks for itself pretty much speaks for itself i have no comments uh no notes the next one is

03:34:17 unveiling an elaborate ruse and it's posting okay three two one go
03:34:25 haha i wasn't really a virgin it was all an act i was nearly pretending to be a virgin
03:34:32 full show wow please don't write in newspaper that i'm a virgin i've had sex i pleased multiples
03:34:38 of times i was fooled but i was listening to the draw costs again and there was this one episode
03:34:44 where it was like locally sad and distraught about her art style and she was talking about how
03:34:51 she felt she was shit because she didn't have like the technique and i just felt really sad about
03:34:58 that because i really like your art style i'm really like the way you use color and shape design
03:35:04 i think it's really expressive and it's something i really miss in my art so i thought i'd call in
03:35:10 and just let you know in case you might still feel that way because i think it would be really
03:35:16 sad if you felt like that about your art style because of some weird notion of what constitutes
03:35:22 technically able good art it's funny i am uh consistently down on myself that's true um
03:35:31 it's not that it's not good um i know i've gotten better over time i think my art style right now
03:35:38 is pretty good uh obviously well it's not obvious but i i do i do want to improve in various ways
03:35:48 but like uh i don't shit on myself quite as much yeah you feel you feel i'm i'm getting better at
03:35:54 your yeah i'm good like like like later later later chapters of cleric gun smoke i read like
03:36:01 i i go over the like the sketches and it's not just the the the art but it's like the the the
03:36:08 layout and the the expressions i'm like oh my god i'm actually emotionally moved by my own comic
03:36:13 even though i wrote it and i'm reading it again it's like oh this is gonna be so good
03:36:20 that's i i can't i can't i honestly can't wait to read the whole thing

03:43:27 fucking best spell is zap and it's like the basic spell like why why can you do 90 damage with a
03:43:34 zap anyway i fucked this game i'm glad it's a fucking garbage good thing i missed out we're
03:43:39 gonna fix it hey instead of like fixing the balance of the game they just they implemented
03:43:44 solo queue shit that nobody asked for all right and it was thanks for keeping me abreast of the
03:43:50 dark and darker you should play it you should buy it situation i would appreciate appreciate the
03:43:55 heads up uh next one is called uh pcp appreciation from this is from prince isolation three two one
03:44:06 go hello everybody with this new content renaissance of sorts that the pcp has recently
03:44:16 been seeming to go through with uh both people starting to stream again uh the possibility of
03:44:22 the perfect comic party and uh things overall looking looking a little bit more uh content wet
03:44:30 as opposed to content dry i thought that maybe it would be fun to sometimes you know call in
03:44:39 with a little voicemail that's just appreciating uh the the content uh that that that we're all
03:44:46 enjoying from the pcp and from ben and gave and from all the uh nasty little creature uh guests
03:44:55 and site people um true on the podcast so um without further ado i want to inaugurate the
03:45:05 ben and gave appreciation hour or the procrastinators appreciation hour uh and you know i don't even
03:45:14 want to be the only one to do this if you have something you appreciate about ben and gave call
03:45:18 into the podcast and talk about it yeah do it i agree it's really cringe and annoying maybe but
03:45:25 also i don't know i like it i agree you should tell me what you like about me yes it would be nice
03:45:35 tell me nice things keep me going in this dark world we live in i'm feeling particularly content
03:45:45 wet as they say um i'm feeling my my fire emblem streams have been fun i want to do more often
03:45:55 oh yeah because i somebody in the last stream did the tallied up it was crunchy crunchy spoon
03:46:02 tallied up um the the average time to beat all fire emblem games and it was like 600 something
03:46:08 hours and if i played like five hours uh during one stream like per week it would take like multiple
03:46:15 years to play them all i think some some some big number that was like uh you know i could probably
03:46:21 do more than one stream a week i don't know when though uh but at the moment Clarissa is taking
03:46:28 priority yeah for the foreseeable future so i don't know i but like i'm i'm i'm enjoying being more
03:46:36 doing of stuff it's very good to be doing stuff um yeah i'm feeling i mean i'm not like
03:46:45 i haven't been drawing but i have been getting stuff done lately for what feels like the first
03:46:50 time in a while and that's exciting um so yeah it's pretty wet yeah moist yeah when it rains at
03:46:58 course yeah and i'm and i'm drenched i'm soaking wet uh right now okay next one is called pcp
03:47:06 appreciation gib coming back to stream um it's it's an it's extra i think prince has put his money
03:47:16 where his mouth is and has actually submitted some items of appreciation so let's go three two one go
03:47:22 back okay okay uh huh what what happened what was that that sounded like a little like a little
03:47:36 gibbism was that me i didn't sound like me i don't think it was you i think it was but it sounded
03:47:42 like a gibbism well i remember saying back when i got back from a break but that doesn't sound
03:47:49 like me no listen to it i i'm not sure i feel like i feel like i feel like it's an impersonation
03:47:57 of you oh this is just meant to appreciate like what you say when you get back to a stream
03:48:04 oh but hey i guess i did say well the next one is ben coming back to a stream uh so maybe these
03:48:11 are partner content okay oh no it's 30 seconds yeah i don't know three two one go
03:48:22 all right let's start again with the stream okay uh let's get started
03:48:28 oh is there is there even a reason to go on
03:48:34 oh oh is there even a reason to go on can i do can i do it can i do this
03:48:42 oh god i don't know i don't know okay let's just oh let's just start okay
03:48:51 i mean first of all true second second of all i mean that's a bit is exacerbated by the fact
03:48:59 that i was streaming battle network uh blivvy and you were there okay something something nice
03:49:05 i was there right i was there for a little bit yeah you were there maybe you weren't there
03:49:09 did i already ask were you there when gamers tavern gave me those maps did i say that already
03:49:16 uh i think you tried asking a question like 40 minutes ago when she was talking maybe that's
03:49:22 what the question was well yeah okay so so so battle network is really annoying because there's
03:49:28 so many random battles and it's really hard to navigate the maps and you get lost really easily
03:49:33 and i don't know where i'm going and it's honestly it's kind of a nightmare but during this during
03:49:37 the last stream on friday gamers tavern uh messaged me a link to a zip file that had all
03:49:43 the in-game maps in it so now i can just look at the maps and know where to go and it's genuinely
03:49:48 i feel like this is going to cut my play time in half and it makes me like so much less annoyed
03:49:54 by it like it's it's a really great uh help so you know i probably was whinging a lot you
03:50:02 have cheated the game and yourself you have learned nothing you have gained nothing yes
03:50:06 and i'm so happy and i i probably was whinging a lot because the game um was really being a
03:50:14 book with its pages stuck together for a while there uh i was only in the stream for like 20
03:50:19 minutes i popped in mentioned the the nate thing and then stuck around for a little bit and talked
03:50:24 about my teeth rotting away oh yes yes i remember wait was that in the stream that you were i remember
03:50:33 you mentioned in your those those those those in the stream chat yeah i was just typing on twitch
03:50:37 right right right right um yes and then so again i gotta thank thank you for alerting me
03:50:43 what a turncoat trader a backstabber natus he wouldn't that he wouldn't raid me you know i
03:50:48 appreciate to know it's better than i know you know it's better than i know so i can so i can

03:54:41 think the girl's cute sure looks like rio co i'm gonna say it terrible voicemail terrible voicemail
03:54:47 not not a lot pretty not a lot going on here not even a voice in this one uh the next one is the
03:54:53 last one and it's called important psa uh from president at usa.gov uh three two one three two one
03:55:04 go you ben did you already explode into a fit of righteous very overnight not rating you and
03:55:10 still not having delivered the ovea eight or six many times if not please proceed to do so now
03:55:16 and feel free to implicate tom and how he deserves everything bad that's happening to him
03:55:22 into your unbridled rage fit as well honestly these people are pathetic losers said
03:55:29 sad that's kind of a terrible donald trump a i voice i've heard better yeah way better ones
03:55:37 that was it was it had to be like deliberately bad because that like sucks a lot no i mean
03:55:43 the i don't know because there was the the voice girl from last week was a pcp 500 that was not me
03:55:51 alizar seemed to think it was me he was like hey do you have that one i'm like no i didn't do that
03:55:55 one i did the other nate ones my nate was better but i also had probably had better training data
03:56:02 for it because i i still have every and i only have this for nate every like wave cleaned up
03:56:10 like pristine like fully background noise do you have that from when you were the pcp editor is
03:56:16 that why yes i see i also have all the voicemails from back then because it's always fun to like
03:56:22 take an old voicemail and fuck with it and then you won't recognize my voice this is why it's not me
03:56:29 we've given over our voices to oblivion fault to train ai's on and create create content out of
03:56:36 and just remix i only do it with public figures and nate people people people that i know personally
03:56:44 i won't do it with unless they explicitly ask me to and enthusiastically consent to uh being
03:56:50 turned into a fucking meme um i mean uh i am cool with it as long as it's funny is if it's funny
03:56:59 anything goes um and i'll decide that's that's that's what i that's how i try and that's how i
03:57:04 try and operate yeah yeah oh shit i guess i did do your voice band i forgot yeah i thought so it

03:57:18 is the end well uh i mean hey the floor is open um let's let's let's talk about stuff let's talk
03:57:29 about our feeling let's talk the episode how do we feel about this episode let's review it's like
03:57:35 five hours long it is four and a half especially if you talk about a piece a single yeah if we do
03:57:43 one if we do one piece after this we're gonna we're gonna hit five hours no problem that that whole
03:57:47 section where i'm just talking shit constantly that's that's gonna be if we gotta cut that then
03:57:53 yeah i'll cut out a big chunk of it lamal okay fair enough uh yeah i'm look for that in a bonus
03:58:03 compilation i guess come in soonish whenever that whenever that happens um
03:58:12 well what do we think are we gonna if we call it give do you want to do one piece after the
03:58:18 bleeding ball takes off yeah my my husband kai just came in my husband my husband he just he

03:58:32 to hang out with me i think i'll be i think i'll be leaving too i'm the you don't want to talk about
03:58:36 one piece with us cheesy ben hates it when people have loving relationships you know i kind of do
03:58:44 oh i see okay gotcha all right well go reads mcpegliacci read mcpegliacci got by the time

03:59:38 it's the joke every first and i hate as soon as somebody leaves it's funny to say i hate them
03:59:43 i hate those guys that son of a bitch bitch bitch son of a bitch uh let's come let's pull up uh the
03:59:50 word the one piece chapter so are we on chapter 10 75 is that the one mm-hmm okay okay so we got
03:59:59 labo phase death game labo yeah and there is a vega vega punk on the cover gora say granted an
04:00:09 audience with the five elders due to scientific genius so he won the scientist competition
04:00:16 with the bubble tanks i guess and then mm-hmm you got to speak to them gotcha makes sense to me
04:00:28 oh i see when the screen dies it becomes the flag of a finland or whatever
04:00:33 that's um that's a joke that's a joke i just made about this panel right here
04:00:42 oh it's scotland i don't yeah i'm sure finland is a right angle top left uh no is scotland the
04:00:51 blue the blue and white yeah diagonal okay yeah some andrew's cross or something yes yeah the
04:00:57 saint andrew's cross is the is the diagonal one right they can't leave because the lasers will
04:01:02 shoot them right that's still happening uh yes the lasers will shoot them because the control thingy
04:01:11 is offline okay organoid artificial human you guys can create organs i thought vega punk got
04:01:22 chopped into pieces what okay well what are you confused about well i don't know are they
04:01:33 she's they're are they are they are they looking at like the seraphim are these like seraphim being
04:01:38 made in these tanks here like they look like these weird blobs i think they're not seraphim they're
04:01:44 just sort of like scientific um they're in the laboratory so there's like oh there's all these
04:01:50 different things not just the seraphim and they're looking at like the the ability to create or the
04:01:57 organs for like surgery transplants and choppers like wow medical science is amazing you can that's
04:02:04 so cool my my translation said it's an organoid an organoid had an asterisk and a translator
04:02:10 note that said artificial human so i'm yeah i don't know it sounded like she was saying they're
04:02:17 just growing a human in there uh but i'm i mean chopper says they can you can grow new organs
04:02:23 that's i get the sense that this part is like kuznami earlier it was like oh you can create
04:02:28 diamonds um they're like learning the value of science i guess yeah learning learning all about
04:02:36 the important lesson that science is the future and the future is cool the camera feeds keep going
04:02:42 scottish one after they just keep going scottish yeah so they've they've split up okay they've split
04:02:50 up into to look for dr vega punk for stella and we know that he's with bonnie in the kuma room
04:03:00 ha ha kuma kuma mm-hmm a bubble gun these strong bubbles can reflect anything ah just like just
04:03:08 like kuma's just like the pacifist's bubble shield hmm just like bubble-based technology
04:03:14 just like gomo gomo fulsen yes yes the most powerful technique it's an attack that bounces
04:03:23 things back hmm i didn't realize that the the vega punk the the eating and sleeping and pooping
04:03:34 vega punk is like a giant i didn't realize she was yeah i i don't think you ever saw her from like
04:03:40 next to someone else yeah lying down with like smaller robots i assumed there was very tiny
04:03:46 robots all around her but no she's just really big yeah it's still so fucking weird that they all
04:03:54 feel the satisfied the satisfaction of taking a shit after she does do they do they all feel this
04:04:03 i think so i think that was like the introduction to us like she i'm hooked and they were like
04:04:07 ah finally she is like she like feels the satisfaction for all of them like she
04:04:14 is the one that handles all the eating and the pooping and the sleeping and she's just like
04:04:18 oh i love it oh i forget i don't remember if they comment that like oh yep i feel that other
04:04:27 self is taking a shit and i'm a big fan i guess that would be weird it's pretty it is weird uh
04:04:36 okay the Pythagoras is head because his little feet yeah his little
04:04:44 guys little feet oh no okay it's the star eye
04:04:49 okay stop york don't get any closer i don't know she has been turned to two stones she is
04:04:57 dead why can she shoot a laser is it just because she's got pacifista laser technology
04:05:04 pretty sure that's that's why yeah oh beam beam is it like based on kizaru fruit is that
04:05:16 i don't know i don't i just imagine that i mean it looks like it in the anime it looks exactly like
04:05:21 like kizaru is uh what is it what is it the pika pika fruit i can't remember the name but yeah
04:05:27 sounds all right um i think it's pika pika i don't think they ever say the the pacifista
04:05:34 just have lasers and then frankie learns how to make a laser so i think it's just a science thing
04:05:40 frankie finds vega punks like um old lab in the two-year timeskip and he learns a bunch of vega
04:05:47 punk stuff and one of the things he learns is how to make a laser beam just like the pacifistas did
04:05:54 and then he comes back and he do and he does a little beam and everyone's like oh cool frankie
04:05:59 you're so much better i suppose lasers are just a thing you can make in in science yeah i made a
04:06:06 laser beam one time out of a fluorescent tube but i did it no didn't not true actually this
04:06:17 okay the proportions on this kuma are like really stupid look how stupid he looks uh this one right
04:06:22 here yeah he looks really dumb i mean he's a child he's just a kid he's just a boy oh it's
04:06:28 wait a minute yeah but they're all children right hold on a second no no okay i thought that this one
04:06:39 this one i thought was an adult like this he was made first and i thought it was just like the ones
04:06:43 that just woke up are the kids because didn't we see kuma didn't we see child kuma in in the memory
04:06:51 bubble and he didn't look like this uh no but we don't know like we don't know exactly how their
04:07:01 model i mean i picked up that they're like oh the seraphim are children and therefore his bigger hit
04:07:09 means that he's like younger than his adult self yeah he doesn't he doesn't have quite the
04:07:15 jawline yet and he's sort of softer looking yeah i guess yeah maybe this is just like him as like a
04:07:21 teenager or like an adolescent whereas the one we saw in the memory was like little boy little boy
04:07:28 but he looked he looked like a completely different little boy he did i guess it's the hat and the
04:07:34 eyes being like white that changes it a lot it's the jaw it's the yeah him wearing the hat
04:07:41 and the and the chin he has some chin here he had no chin in the memory okay okay i gotta read
04:07:51 so so who ordered the pacifistas to do this the seraphim the seraphim
04:07:59 i
04:08:03 i think the the only reason oh the it's oh it says here the one that who gave this command was
04:08:09 vega punk if my orders are being obeyed then i mean okay it must be by the original vega punk
04:08:15 which is like hmm it's a little little sus uh
04:08:25 because it wasn't because sentomaru outranks
04:08:30 the cp-zeros but it wasn't him and the only one that outranks sentomaru
04:08:36 is vega punk so if you're not listening to cp-zeros and then the gurus say above vega punk
04:08:42 then vega punk must have told them to do this right is that right yeah that's that's the only
04:08:48 explanation and the at least based on what he's saying here is that the vega punk prime the stella
04:08:57 said um kill everyone or at least they seem to be i see we don't know whether they're
04:09:06 fighting the straw hats necessarily because the straw hats are with different groups of people
04:09:11 with a different vega punk and also the cp-zero but i i don't know like what the hell could this
04:09:21 order be for i mean we've seen stella is just like a baby with bonnie and he seemed like he didn't
04:09:33 when would he have had time to give this order to the seraphim to commit
04:09:38 it war it's it's odd um because early on in the chapter there was like oh there's a mysterious
04:09:50 person there and we learned that it's the the seraphim walking around destroying cameras
04:09:55 so they don't want anyone to know and there have been like tiny hints that like the seraphim are not
04:10:04 like quite like the pacifista in that they're not totally robotic yeah they're like they have a bit
04:10:12 of humanity in them zoro felt something when he was fighting me hawk yeah earlier yeah and so it's
04:10:18 like are they acting of their own volition at this point what would they want maybe i don't know
04:10:28 i don't know either could could the seraphim have been a failed experiment and it's like
04:10:33 shit's going wrong and they're just like you know what we don't want to be uh friends
04:10:39 actually i mean this kuma was obeying the cp-zero but maybe he was maybe he was just pretending the
04:10:47 whole time yeah maybe they're just maybe they're just going going rogue hey oh oh but but but number
04:10:56 one i forgot this part he says yeah between the communications blackout the barrier sealing us in
04:11:03 and the seraphim rebelling seems to look it seems like it's an elaborate plan somebody's trying to
04:11:08 kill us all so that could be vega punk who's who said be like who said that uh the number one
04:11:15 face oh shaka yeah shaka yeah i see him right at the end like he he says like yeah because we don't
04:11:22 know who how the communications were blacked out we thought it was somebody else but like who else
04:11:30 is there like stella has been revealed to be now i although she's with vega punk maybe she still
04:11:37 isn't a now i and it's like a double ruse you mean you mean stussy stussy sorry yeah so many
04:11:48 in this chapter in this in this arc two
04:11:58 yeah yeah i mean i guess we're i guess we didn't recap the chapter we didn't recap last chapter
04:12:05 listen the last episode if you want to hear last chapter well i guess well no i mean like
04:12:11 you read it but we didn't really talk about every page no but yeah things are destroying the cameras
04:12:17 um shaka's like what's going on everybody's split up nami and brook are with the little guy
04:12:25 and they're finding like diamonds that are artificially generated and she's getting money eyes
04:12:32 belly eyes um chopper and robin are with the big big one
04:12:41 and they're and they're they're doing the classic like arc everyone split up and search for clues
04:12:46 sort of so that you can be in a different situation right different place so you can have a different
04:12:50 bath time time to pair up our characters in different combinations and see what kind of
04:12:55 chemistry they have together yeah classic and then classic bit so like everyone's splitting up
04:13:06 uh sanji says uh he'll be a dog for for us to see yep same that's that's same that's pretty funny
04:13:16 uh all right this this graph uh i'm a little bit unclear on what's being communicated here in this
04:13:23 uh oh and then food lady gets destroyed food lady gets completely obliterated she's turned
04:13:29 turned to stone kicked by uh amazon and then boahankov that's right this this like tower here
04:13:36 okay so this is like so they're in tower a and it looks like tower b and tower c have been like
04:13:45 blown up and and like has the the top of tower a has been like cut off i kind of don't remember
04:13:52 when that happened uh well it was just before the seraphim had been calmed down um if you remember
04:14:02 they got up there and then they started blowing shit up okay yeah because they were still with
04:14:06 cp0 um and then one of the vega punks i think it was the little guy he flew at them and he was like
04:14:16 wait stop and he just got the commander in time and then they all stopped but by that point
04:14:22 mihawk uh had sliced oh mihawk oh yeah hey and the other two had blown stuff up okay so it's like
04:14:29 doesn't mihawk uh doesn't mihawk have like a legendary blade so like is i wonder if is this
04:14:36 uh like child mihawk like he's got a similar looking sword i wonder if it's just like a replica
04:14:41 and like it's not as good i i would imagine it's not as good or just like it's made of
04:14:47 you know it's it's comparable maybe yeah i mean this guy's got like world government money could
04:14:54 probably afford maybe they commission maybe they could duplicate maybe they could duplicate the
04:14:58 powers of like a cursed blade with uh with with science somehow like a hacky and flute infused
04:15:04 blade i mean they can make frickin anything else they want they copy these like legendary people
04:15:09 and their fruit powers like they it seems like yeah they can just fucking do anything
04:15:15 making a magic sword seems like a a trifle compared to all this so yeah wouldn't be too surprised
04:15:23 yeah so the main thing of the whole chapter is people are split up and then the seraphim are
04:15:28 evil we got uh bow handcock with usopp and frankie and then uh mihawk and kuma seraphim
04:15:40 are charging up trying to kill the cp zero guys and so they're fighting or they're about to fight
04:15:47 luffy and zoro uh we don't know where the gym bay one is yeah he is not pictured
04:15:55 yeah i think there's only those four
04:16:00 uh so are they they're they're all in like separate towers right or are they just on
04:16:07 different they have towers c floor three tower b floor two tower a floor two tower a floor two
04:16:17 all right they started in tower a floor three building c third floor
04:16:25 all right we're yeah that's setting up this for stuff yeah this is starting to get a little
04:16:31 bit like wano like okay the floating city is up here and then there's like a tunnel down here and
04:16:37 like the the magma is like going down through the thing and it's going to hit the weapon store
04:16:42 which is down below everything even when oda does these little maps with labels for all
04:16:49 these different sections and then says you know when you cut to a different uh situation with
04:16:55 different characters and there's a little box saying oh this is the left side of the great
04:17:00 hall or something um i'm like i cannot understand what that is i can't hold it in my mind all at
04:17:07 the same time it's it's it's better on the anime because like they have like little animations for
04:17:12 little floating heads that move here and there in fact i did that in bell shape i remember
04:17:19 doing a little bell shape one of those because i liked it i see yeah i can get that image
04:17:27 all right well i mean i i think i've um i think i've pretty much got to handle on what happens
04:17:33 this chapter oh he's not oh yeah yeah yeah yeah this one this map it's like dare they all are
04:17:40 i remember there was uh yes so coherent a lot going on oh yeah oh right bell jake was good
04:17:47 action i i forgot bell jake was kind of cool actually hmm now i remember bell jake when's bell jake
04:17:57 too you know once i finish Clarissa i think bell jake two is the next like thing people want to see
04:18:08 so i'll probably work on it then i think um i think this week i should probably
04:18:16 having finished a bunch of other stuff i think my work this week is probably gonna be uh the
04:18:21 the pcp website and um yeah i should probably get started on on bscapades and pick that up i
04:18:28 should actually like get to it i guess i haven't really even touched it it's all been just it's
04:18:34 all been talk so far um i have to do something about that uh yeah too hard so hard but i'm
04:18:47 how fast do you think you can make what however many panels you're thinking of
04:18:55 i i i don't really know how many i'm thinking like drawing it is like is kind of secondary
04:19:00 to us thinking up what is gonna happen wait say what for for bscapades like drawing it isn't that
04:19:07 strenuous it's more like trying to keep everything in your head like where the story's going and
04:19:12 writing the most the most daunting part is that i have to go back and i have to reread it to remember
04:19:16 like where i was and like what was going on and and recall like what i was gonna have happen next
04:19:22 i've kind of forgotten and lost the the plot so i just have to do that and and until then i
04:19:30 don't even remember like what the plan was i have to figure it out uh and so i yeah i don't even know
04:19:39 i don't even know how how long the like next chunk is gonna be
04:19:45 ah but i fortunately it's on my website so i can just go and read it all there
04:19:49 and i'm sure i'll take it pick it right back up yeah actually drawing the pages is not that hard
04:19:55 especially if i kind of issue the like gifs thing because like i mean i was doing the gif
04:20:02 animated like that's not really that necessary for like a pdf version that wouldn't carry
04:20:09 over so yeah it's not it's not that important if there's something i really want to animate like
04:20:14 i can do an animated panel it should be like check out the animated version here dummy dummy idiot
04:20:22 stupid why are you reading this on a static format nerd check it out on the worldwide web
04:20:27 whoa whoa what all right to to cap off one piece because we finished talking about it um
04:20:35 and then the cp0 are gonna team up looks like the straw hats in order to fight the seraphim
04:20:42 we're just gonna be up a little bit of a hijink i think uh they don't like to look oh man how
04:20:50 quickly how quickly the turntables enemies become allies it's my favorite trope to lovers yeah um
04:20:58 it's funny because it's like luci was always such a you know back in the day that was like
04:21:05 well captain smoker he's the bad guy but then you beat you beat him or like you're more powerful
04:21:13 and he run away and he's like ah those dang straw hats but he sort of respects them and it's like
04:21:18 yeah you know what this smoker guy is not so bad but then there's luci and he's like this guy is a
04:21:24 murderer killing she has a real fucking sicko yeah there's no way this guy could have a vegeta
04:21:29 moment but here we are where he's forced to be friendly i mean he's still a i mean i guess he's
04:21:35 still a bad guy but you know he's definitely still a bad guy we need all the help we can get against
04:21:39 these he's he's not as bloodthirsty as he used to be he is he's just sort of like i mean i haven't
04:21:49 seen anything to suggest that he's like nicer or no he's not nicer but like it's it's just the
04:21:57 it's just a vibe like forced forced camaraderie he's wearing white now he's wearing white now
04:22:02 he's a good guy but what about what about all that white guilt yeah true yeah never mind
04:22:13 that's much much much better much better way to interpret it well i don't know i think that's
04:22:21 it that's all i have to say about it the one thing i have to mention about okay the this chapter
04:22:27 two panels that look exactly the same it's when i think it's lila uh is screaming
04:22:36 yeah she's like she's like what a seraphim why are you here you scroll down a bit and she's like
04:22:41 quit joking around we don't stand a chance it's exactly the same oh my god angle yeah they do
04:22:48 she's just maybe it's just like yelling and i i know why it's that way it's because her eyes
04:22:55 are covered on that one side of her face so you have to show her from that angle when
04:22:59 you show her saying anything and she's also still scared and shocked so she's screaming and it's the
04:23:06 same face and it's the same angle it's just like i guess she's screaming louder in the second one
04:23:10 it's just like a little bit louder you've got to do something to differentiate it it's funny
04:23:15 yeah it's very it's very similar true you make a guess lilith is cool lilith looks awesome her hair
04:23:23 rules her jacket is yeah they're so cool all of this all of the so fucking cool like lilith especially
04:23:31 and generally the outfits in this arc are amazing yeah i love them they're all just funny and cool
04:23:39 but also a little bit like unique and uh fresh yeah it feels a little bit like wasteful sometimes
04:23:46 when it's like man all this cool shit and it's like you never really get a chance to like take it in
04:23:54 you know oh to just make so much good shit all the time so many secondary tertiary characters
04:23:59 that just got funny cool designs that are really cool and you see them for one chapter or two
04:24:04 chapters and then they're just never again seen well well but then there's like hundreds upon
04:24:09 hundreds of characters that are just really good the more it goes on the more you keep seeing these
04:24:14 old characters that were seen like one time and it's like oh they're back like oh what are let's
04:24:18 check in on what they're up to like oh they're like you know at uh marriage or oh they were at the
04:24:25 reverie or oh they're like working inside the world government or they're in the marines trying to do
04:24:29 something or they're on a secret mission or whatever they'll be like a throwaway character
04:24:35 like that and then put so many of them end up like brought back and recycled in some weird new
04:24:41 context and it's cool when you you know like uh you see a guy that you had he's like oh i totally
04:24:49 forgot that that was a character but he's back yeah uh it's great i love it
04:25:00 i guess there's not like a lot going on in this chapter there's no there's not like a lot of
04:25:06 revelations there's a question though who the fuck just fucking is vega punk bad now is vega
04:25:12 punk betray us i'm trying to think if there's a likelihood that he is bad because it's like he's
04:25:19 working with the world government but he knows the world government wants to kill him and he's
04:25:23 siding with the store has to get him out of there why would he kill him i feel like there's some
04:25:28 other mysterious third party that is actually here narratively i think if vega punk were evil
04:25:34 they would not have the characters questioning like wait a minute is vega punk the one who's
04:25:39 doing this like yeah yeah probably not because we're wondering about it i think it's it's a
04:25:47 potential misdirect to have the mysterious person going around destroying the cameras be the seraphim
04:25:55 because it's sort of implied that there is actually a another third party like unknown
04:26:01 person here doing these things but they're not the seraphim maybe they can talk to the seraphim
04:26:06 maybe it's a fucking maybe the goro say teleported in because he's just like super strong
04:26:13 and he's just in there so you do you think there is a third party or do you think it's
04:26:18 just one of the seraphim like maybe it's the jinbei seraphim who is not around maybe he's the one
04:26:23 doing it and the seraphim have gone rogue well either the seraphim have gone rogue for some
04:26:30 reason or another they decided to have their own thoughts and feelings and they've chosen this path
04:26:36 or foolishly yeah or they are being controlled by either vega punk who is uh for some reason
04:26:42 telling them to do this or a goro say which is impossible i think um or you know what it could
04:26:50 be i feel like this would be kind of unsatisfying because it's just sort of like building up a
04:26:55 mystery for no payoff like maybe it's a mistake in the programming and vega punk's like oh shit
04:27:02 oh jeez uh i didn't mean for that to happen let me quick this button uh now that now they've
04:27:08 calmed down again it's like i already did that he just was careless i was like oh i forgot to
04:27:15 carry the one like whoops like it could be funny but like yeah hmm yeah man
04:27:24 yeah i think i think it's a bit of a letdown if that's the reason
04:27:30 i kind of i'm kind of going with the seraphim are going rogue and they're just kind of decided
04:27:38 to do their own thing and they're they're they're they're they're making a break for it they're
04:27:43 hatching a plan that seems like what is has been suggested by all the oh there's some humanity in
04:27:53 you yada yada yeah that's what i'm going for yeah that's the chapter uh all right are we done
