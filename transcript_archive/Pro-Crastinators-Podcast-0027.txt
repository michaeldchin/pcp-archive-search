00:00:00 Now, since the last time I've rolled through these parts, and I do roll through with some frequency,
00:00:05 I'm a little bit like herpes, I keep coming back.
00:00:09 But since the last time I might have seen some of you folks, I have had my 70th birthday.
00:00:15 Thank you.
00:00:21 Yeah, I'm now 70 years old, and I like 70.
00:00:25 Not as much as I like 69.
00:00:29 Well, 69 was always my favorite number.
00:00:33 Now I figure I'm 69 with one finger up my ass.
00:00:43 But now that I'm an old fuck, and that's what I consider myself to be, an old fuck.
00:00:50 Old fuck is a very special term. It's not like old man. Old man is different.
00:00:55 Old man isn't really a time in your life or a period of years. It's an attitude.
00:01:00 Old man is a point of view. It's a way of looking at things.
00:01:03 Some guys are old men when they're in their 20s. You've met guys like that.
00:01:06 They're just wired like old men. Not me, not an old man, and not an old fart.
00:01:11 Because an old fart is kind of...
00:01:16 What I am is an old fuck. It's kind of like a fat fuck.
00:01:21 Fat fuck, tall fuck, skinny fuck, short fuck.
00:01:25 Old fuck. Who's the old fuck? That's Georgie. Georgie's the old fuck.
00:01:30 In this respect, fuck is actually a synonym for the word fellow.
00:01:37 But now that I'm an old fuck, I'm beginning to notice there are some advantages to putting on a few extra years.
00:01:43 The first one is, you never have to carry anything heavy ever again.
00:01:48 Everybody wants to help an old fuck. If you've got a big suitcase or something like that,
00:01:53 you know, you just kind of go like this a little bit.
00:01:55 You say, yeah, could you help me with this?
00:01:57 Yeah, hey, how far are you going? Indianapolis.
00:02:01 He wants to help. Fuck him, put him to work.
00:02:05 Take advantage of people.
00:02:07 Another nice thing about getting old is you can leave any social event early just by saying you're tired.
00:02:15 Works great with family members. Just turn to the person next to you and say, jeez, I'm getting tired, you know.
00:02:22 Oh, you're tired? Come on, grandpa's tired. Grandpa's going to bed.
00:02:25 Someone else is, but it's 7.30 in the morning.
00:02:29 There's always one asshole in the family.
00:02:33 But the best thing about getting old is you're not responsible for remembering things anymore.
00:02:39 Even important things. But it was your daughter's funeral.
00:02:47 I forgot. You can even make believe you have Alzheimer's disease. That's a lot of fun.
00:02:55 You look around the dining room table and you say, who are you, people, and where is my horse?
00:03:02 Then you stare at your oldest son and say, Agnes, I haven't seen you since First Communion.
00:03:08 Fucks them up. They don't know how to handle it.
00:03:13 It takes them a week to get over that shit.
00:03:16 And they start listening to you a lot more carefully from their own.
00:03:20 So don't be afraid to get old. It's a great time of life.
00:03:23 You get to take advantage of people and you're not responsible for anything.
00:03:28 You can even shit in your pants.
00:03:37 They expect it. I haven't tried that yet, but I don't rule it out.
00:03:44 I'm keeping my options open. Everything is on the table.
00:03:51 Perhaps that's not the figure of speech I wanted.
00:03:56 Welcome, one and all, to the Procrastinator's podcast episode I don't know.
00:04:00 Today with me is, I'm Hippocrite by the way. Today with me is Nate.
00:04:06 Hey guys, I'm the best guy ever. What's going on at your house?
00:04:10 And Ben.
00:04:14 My house is pretty good, Nate. How about yours?
00:04:19 It's okay. I have to move in like three weeks though, so that's kind of stressing me out.
00:04:25 Oh no. Oh no.
00:04:27 I kind of forgot shit out. Oh no.
00:04:30 Meanwhile, on the Procrastinator's podcast, we're talking about...
00:04:34 That sure is an adult problem you have, Nate.
00:04:37 It is. It is.
00:04:39 Meanwhile, on the Procrastinator's podcast, we're talking about people complaining about getting old and how they're stupid for doing so.
00:04:48 I was trying to segue there.
00:04:50 Oh, well, I'm the guy saying the intro, so I got offended.
00:04:57 I respect that authority.
00:04:59 It's the old cast today.
00:05:02 Yeah, and how everyone's always, a lot of people are like, oh no, I'm getting old, I'm fucked.
00:05:12 Or like people that really dread getting old.
00:05:16 Here's what's interesting about the thing about dreading getting older, is that it happens at every age.
00:05:22 That's true. Every single age.
00:05:24 I mean, some kids can't wait to grow up. I was not a kid like that.
00:05:29 I was a kid who was like, man, I sure don't want to be an adult.
00:05:33 And you know, once you're an adult, you're like, oh man, I don't want to be an old adult.
00:05:38 That sounds bad.
00:05:41 But to me, it's like, it's like, my experience has been, whatever age I am, that's like the right age, the normal age, and I'm scared to get older.
00:05:54 But like, I don't, I don't know.
00:05:56 It's like, you're old to any, you don't want to be old, right?
00:06:00 But whatever age you are, you're not old to yourself, because you yourself are the reference point, right?
00:06:05 Like, no matter what age you are, you're old compared to the people younger than you, and you're young compared to the people older than you.
00:06:11 That's always true. That's always really what it boils down to, right?
00:06:14 Yeah, I mean, a lot of the time I think the fear of getting older is fear of the unknown.
00:06:20 You're like, yeah, I don't know what's going to happen soon. I'm scared about it.
00:06:23 Which is a pretty reasonable thing to be afraid of.
00:06:26 Yeah, I guess. But I don't know. I don't feel like that.
00:06:29 I'm not scared of getting old and dying as much as other people seem to be.
00:06:34 Like the whole like, oh no, one day I won't be around.
00:06:37 Oh man, I'm pretty scared of that.
00:06:39 Whatever. I'm pretty scared of death.
00:06:41 I've already got more, like, recorded stuff of me, more than most people.
00:06:49 So people will remember me more than the average person.
00:06:52 Right, but I think about how like, you know, I mean, what if, you know, Google or whatever goes out of business
00:06:58 and like all the YouTube servers go away and like all our videos are going to go away at some point
00:07:02 and that will be forgotten. So I think about how long this legacy will really last.
00:07:06 What I'm thinking more on that is people, like there's a guy 500 years ago thinking about the same thing
00:07:16 and nobody knows his name and nobody cares and all of his family is dead
00:07:20 and that's just how it is.
00:07:22 I just feel like eventually I'm going to be that guy 500 years in the past.
00:07:27 You're going to be that guy.
00:07:29 You're going back to the past, baby.
00:07:31 Yeah, you know what I mean.
00:07:33 I know exactly what you mean.
00:07:35 I feel like worrying about it is just a waste of time because it's not really, I mean,
00:07:40 there's all that talk about plugging your brain into a thing and living forever.
00:07:45 I don't care. It's a hassle.
00:07:47 What the fuck is a hassle?
00:07:49 I don't care.
00:07:50 I probably get annoyed with the instruction booklet and technology sucks by the time.
00:07:56 It's like a VCR programming thing you're talking about.
00:07:59 But what a hell of a fuck this. I'm not dealing with this today.
00:08:02 I'll just die in my chair.
00:08:04 He's getting up and plugging your brain into the machine.
00:08:09 I'll be like 90 years old and I'll already hate new technology and all the kids and everything.
00:08:16 I'll be like, why would I want to sit around with all these weirdos?
00:08:19 Yeah, God, I mean, you don't want to be that technology, right?
00:08:24 That would be suck. That would be the worst.
00:08:26 Technology's gay, so being it would make you be gay.
00:08:29 It's like all those kids with polio who refuse to use the iron lung because they just hate a technology.
00:08:34 Man, fuck it. I'm not getting in that man's machine.
00:08:37 I'm going to live my own life.
00:08:38 I admire those kids resolve.
00:08:41 They lived and died according to their principles and I really respect that.
00:08:45 I got to respect that.
00:08:48 They died the way they lived, not in an iron lung.
00:08:53 It's true.
00:08:55 So yeah, there's that side of the whole thing, like I'm scared of dying.
00:08:59 But then there's also the more annoying aspect of complaining about getting old is that there's people younger than you saying,
00:09:05 oh my God, Pokemon's 20, well, you know, Pokemon's not a good example,
00:09:09 but like something like Pokemon like, oh my God, it's 20 years old.
00:09:13 I feel really old.
00:09:15 I'm going to post on Facebook and get loads of sad clicks from people my age.
00:09:20 Yeah.
00:09:21 That's just, I hate it.
00:09:23 It's one of those things where I only think that you should,
00:09:26 okay, like everyone has that experience.
00:09:28 Everyone gets old and there's no avoiding it.
00:09:30 There is one way to avoid it.
00:09:32 Yeah, to put both in the brain.
00:09:34 But the only way that you should be allowed to complain
00:09:38 is if you're actively working to combat it by researching like genetic aging
00:09:43 and like, you know, if you're one of the people on the forefront trying to fix this shit.
00:09:47 Not everyone can do that.
00:09:49 Well, exactly.
00:09:50 So you should shut the fuck up about it, you know, because we all get it.
00:09:53 We all understand we're dying slowly.
00:09:55 We got both feet in the grave.
00:09:57 I think there's half the people that are just sort of saying it for frivolous reasons.
00:10:03 They're not thinking about death.
00:10:05 They're just, yeah, they just want to get...
00:10:07 Yeah, it's relatable.
00:10:08 It's a relatable thing to say.
00:10:10 It's like nostalgia and all that.
00:10:12 I mean, it's old now.
00:10:14 Yeah, these sorts of things look really good on a Facebook image macro.
00:10:18 Well, if you're an idiot looking at the macro, then sure.
00:10:23 Have you seen that vine of like, it's like some shitty comic of a guy like tucking the sheets under his feet
00:10:31 and then it's like, I sleep this way and then it cuts to the guy reading the comic
00:10:36 and he's like, I do that.
00:10:39 And that's the funny thing.
00:10:40 I have it, but that sounds amusing.
00:10:42 I've seen that a lot. I like it.
00:10:46 Sorry, I interrupted with my shitty anecdote.
00:10:49 Go on, Gib.
00:10:50 I don't know.
00:10:52 Let me say, all right, I think it's Harry Potter 6 at some point.
00:10:58 I think it's when it's like the attack on Hogwarts like that,
00:11:01 that shitty, that werewolf guy gray,
00:11:04 gray wind, lol, cross-reference.
00:11:07 Grimjaw, yeah.
00:11:08 Yeah, sure.
00:11:09 And those two, like the Allister siblings, I think?
00:11:13 I don't know, they're there and they're attacking Dumbledore.
00:11:16 And I think one of them calls them old.
00:11:18 They're like, ah, fuck you, old man.
00:11:20 And they rebate him a quote from the series.
00:11:22 And Dumbledore is like, I forget his words,
00:11:26 but he's like, yeah, I'm old.
00:11:28 You will be two one day if you're lucky.
00:11:31 And it's like, shit, man, you're so right.
00:11:34 And that's what it's like.
00:11:36 Like you said, there's no getting around it.
00:11:38 And in fact, it's way better than the alternative.
00:11:41 So looked at through that lens, it's nothing to fear exactly.
00:11:48 I definitely look forward to the position of being an old man
00:11:52 who specifically can sit on his porch and yell at people.
00:11:55 But even aside from that, being distinguished,
00:11:58 being able to grow a beard is something I dream of doing one day.
00:12:01 I assume that'll happen as I become an old man.
00:12:06 There's perks to being an old ass man.
00:12:08 As you get older, you look more distinguished.
00:12:10 Men get pretty sexy when they get old.
00:12:12 So I look forward to that.
00:12:14 There's ancillary benefits, they do.
00:12:16 Gay right now.
00:12:18 I have a keenly honed appreciation for the male form.
00:12:22 Like no other.
00:12:24 I do agree though.
00:12:26 Old guys, they're cool.
00:12:28 Even Dumbledore looks badass.
00:12:30 Yeah, because he's like in a movie, right?
00:12:33 Like they made them up to look real.
00:12:35 I don't know, I don't agree with...
00:12:36 Okay, senility is not cool, but like...
00:12:38 I mean, some people, I mean...
00:12:40 Alright.
00:12:42 That's the only thing I'm actually afraid of is like...
00:12:45 What?
00:12:46 Going senile and not being able to tell people to just kill me.
00:12:50 Fair.
00:12:51 I don't want to be in a position where I'm just shitting my pants all the time.
00:12:55 And that's it.
00:12:56 I think a lot of people share that.
00:12:58 When they say they don't want to, you know, they fear getting old,
00:13:00 I think that's probably a lot of what people are talking about.
00:13:02 I wouldn't be so bad, like if I was just old and I don't know,
00:13:05 I couldn't walk very well, that's fine.
00:13:07 You know, I can get over that.
00:13:09 It's just having my brain become mush.
00:13:13 That's the worst.
00:13:14 But you know, people aren't talking about that when they post like...
00:13:17 Oh, I still like Pokemon, I'm so old.
00:13:20 Of course, Pokemon Go has made Pokemon like hugely popular once again.
00:13:23 But before that, it was like, I still like Pokemon.
00:13:26 I played Pokemon Red, I feel so old, I don't know these new Pokemon.
00:13:30 It's, shut up.
00:13:32 Shut up.
00:13:33 Yeah, fuck you and appreciate the new gens,
00:13:37 or I'll come to your house and kick you in the knees.
00:13:41 Yeah, especially...
00:13:42 I really appreciate when, like, all the guys get into, like, young things.
00:13:47 Like, um...
00:13:48 Like young women? Like children?
00:13:50 Is that what you're talking about?
00:13:51 Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
00:13:52 I got you.
00:13:53 I got you.
00:13:54 Little children.
00:13:57 What I'm talking about is, like, when they can get into technology,
00:13:59 like Steven Fry, he adopted Twitter,
00:14:02 like, really early on, and he's like a big advocate for new things.
00:14:06 But then he quit it because he got mad.
00:14:08 Well, yeah, but...
00:14:09 That's a separate issue, yeah.
00:14:10 Yeah, I'm just...
00:14:11 I want to be an old guy that's cool with new stuff,
00:14:14 but at the moment, I'm not actually cool with new stuff.
00:14:16 So what you're telling me is...
00:14:17 Yeah, I've been behind the technological curve my entire life.
00:14:21 I only started using Twitter, like, this year.
00:14:24 Yeah, me too.
00:14:25 So, Gabe, you want to be a sexy grandpa?
00:14:28 I do.
00:14:29 And you want to, you get the t-shirt now,
00:14:31 and you'll be ready in a hundred years.
00:14:33 A hundred years.
00:14:35 Or whatever.
00:14:37 Well, maybe.
00:14:38 Hey, yeah.
00:14:39 I'm pretty good, you know?
00:14:40 Yeah, I guess.
00:14:41 Good medical technology is getting.
00:14:43 I'm pretty excited about...
00:14:44 All right, here's a tangential thing.
00:14:47 With all the...
00:14:48 You know, you get in old parts of your body, stop working.
00:14:50 People are getting replacements.
00:14:52 They've been getting hip replacements for years.
00:14:54 What if, when we're old,
00:14:56 we can have the opportunity to just become a cyborg?
00:14:59 Would you do it?
00:15:00 That's the Ghost in the Shell dream, man.
00:15:02 I wouldn't put my brain into a computer,
00:15:04 but I would get an iron leg.
00:15:06 That would be cool.
00:15:07 Well, like, as opposed to dying?
00:15:09 Would you go full ride in
00:15:11 and just be like a brain in a fucking robot suit?
00:15:15 As opposed to death?
00:15:17 Absolutely.
00:15:19 All right.
00:15:20 Just think of the adventure.
00:15:21 Think of the extended adventure your life becomes.
00:15:23 Would you become a cyborg ninja with your bare ninja?
00:15:26 There is a song by Jonathan Colton.
00:15:29 It is covered by Imagine Dragons.
00:15:31 It's called The Future Soon, and it's a great song.
00:15:33 I fucking love it.
00:15:35 But the chorus has this line
00:15:38 that brings me to tears.
00:15:39 It's about this angry nerd,
00:15:41 and the whole song is him fantasizing about his ideal future.
00:15:45 And he says,
00:15:46 It's gonna be the future soon.
00:15:48 I won't always be this way
00:15:51 when the things that make me weak and strange
00:15:54 get engineered away.
00:15:56 That's a good line.
00:15:57 Yeah, like, holy shit.
00:15:59 That's what I want.
00:16:00 Man, I could feel his insecurities
00:16:02 and he's like,
00:16:03 The robots are gonna fix me.
00:16:05 They'll improve me and make me a strong handsome boy.
00:16:07 He's like hurting inside.
00:16:09 He's putting his only escape
00:16:11 from his self-imposed hell that is his life
00:16:14 is this thought that maybe one day
00:16:16 science fiction will come true
00:16:18 and everything will change
00:16:19 and he'll be at the forefront of it.
00:16:21 Oh my god.
00:16:23 I'm quivering.
00:16:24 I'm quivering just thinking about it.
00:16:26 I like the idea of being a physical being
00:16:29 with a brain with robotic eyes,
00:16:31 robotic body, the whole thing.
00:16:33 I don't like the idea of being a brain in a jar
00:16:35 hooked up to a simulation world or whatever.
00:16:38 Well, let me just play devil's advocate for it.
00:16:40 No, I'm just gonna explain my reasoning
00:16:42 is because as a physical being
00:16:44 you can still decide to end your life
00:16:46 whenever you want by jumping off a cliff or whatever.
00:16:49 You can take your brain out and kick it.
00:16:51 I don't know.
00:16:52 Oh, so you mean like being kind of like in the matrix?
00:16:55 Yeah, I don't want to be stuck in a matrix.
00:16:59 The year is 2167.
00:17:04 A renowned internet hero and cyborg,
00:17:08 Hippocrite, ends own life
00:17:11 by drop kicking own brain out.
00:17:14 That's the headline.
00:17:17 I've seen it writ large.
00:17:20 Yeah, on all the banners and all the top of Twitter
00:17:23 turning on Neo Twitter.
00:17:25 Brain lands in nearby baby carriage
00:17:27 leading to hilarious mix up.
00:17:30 It's a hilarious British antics.
00:17:33 What's that song?
00:17:36 Yakety Sax.
00:17:39 Yeah, that's the one.
00:17:40 People just hot potatoing the brain around.
00:17:43 Oh man, and like it would be like
00:17:48 the brain would be like all cute,
00:17:50 like looking around like, oh no.
00:17:52 I'm still a brain flying around.
00:17:54 Alright, I was gonna say though,
00:17:56 because if you think about it,
00:17:57 our entire existence, you know, there is a distinction,
00:17:59 but our entire existence is basically the brain in the jar.
00:18:02 Because all we are is a brain hooked up to a robot
00:18:05 that is just our shitty human body
00:18:08 that perceives stuff, however.
00:18:11 And you could argue whether it's real or not.
00:18:13 Let's just assume it is and that you can end your own life.
00:18:15 But like even in the matrix,
00:18:17 you can kill yourself and you can still end it if you want to.
00:18:21 So I guess you're saying,
00:18:23 what's the issue?
00:18:24 Like if you killed yourself in a matrix,
00:18:26 you'd be a responder?
00:18:27 Well, I don't think I remember the matrix very well,
00:18:30 but if there's like a thing where you're hooked up
00:18:33 to a computer that you know is built by people,
00:18:36 like I know that people built this,
00:18:38 that they could do stuff to me.
00:18:40 Like I'd be paranoid that I know that they made something
00:18:43 and they have complete control over my consciousness.
00:18:46 And I don't like that.
00:18:48 They wanted to torture me, they could.
00:18:52 How do you know you're not right now?
00:18:54 We have no way of knowing.
00:18:56 Well, I'm not going to torture you right now.
00:18:58 My point is why worry about it.
00:19:01 There's no way to know anyway.
00:19:03 Fuck it.
00:19:05 Yeah, but the thing is, I don't know now,
00:19:07 but like in the future,
00:19:09 if there is a big computer that I could hook myself into,
00:19:12 I would know that there is a chance that they can do stuff to me.
00:19:15 Right now I have no idea.
00:19:17 But if I had the choice,
00:19:19 I'd rather be a robot than in a machine,
00:19:22 in a matrix.
00:19:24 Oh, I got you.
00:19:26 You'd rather be a cyborg than a matrix, man.
00:19:28 Okay, that's cool.
00:19:30 I agree.
00:19:31 Ghost Michelle, make it happen.
00:19:33 I think we're a little bit off topic now.
00:19:35 We're talking about the trans symbolism and post...
00:19:37 It's not related.
00:19:39 What's the word? Post-singularity?
00:19:41 Post-singularity was the word I was looking for.
00:19:43 Oh, post-cyberpocalypse is a way better word for it, though.
00:19:47 Let me...
00:19:49 Okay, okay.
00:19:51 Going back to what you said about
00:19:53 old men being sexy,
00:19:55 or men being sexy when they get older.
00:19:57 Now, I think there are men
00:19:59 that look good at most ages.
00:20:01 I don't...
00:20:03 I don't know.
00:20:05 That is one of the things that does bother me
00:20:07 about aging is that, like,
00:20:09 you get ugly.
00:20:11 Not everyone, but most people get ugly.
00:20:13 I mean, I'm...
00:20:15 I don't think I'm a great look.
00:20:17 I think I'm pretty average-looking,
00:20:19 so, like, I don't know.
00:20:21 I certainly don't want to get any uglier, right?
00:20:23 That would just be rough.
00:20:25 That would be a death sentence, for sure.
00:20:27 Yeah, it would. Once I dip below,
00:20:29 once I dip down to the other side of the bell curve,
00:20:31 I'm just done.
00:20:33 And I'm right in the brink.
00:20:35 I don't feel like young people,
00:20:37 because you don't look ugly now.
00:20:39 You wouldn't become more ugly when you get wrinkles,
00:20:41 but people who like old people
00:20:43 don't mind the wrinkles.
00:20:45 But you guys know, like,
00:20:47 it's not weird to people who...
00:20:49 I don't know.
00:20:51 Some people look really weird when they get old.
00:20:53 Maybe those people were generally weird looking
00:20:55 all along. I don't know.
00:20:57 Okay, but the thing is...
00:20:59 Do you mean, like, celebrities where it's like,
00:21:01 oh, I know them as a young person,
00:21:03 and now they're old and it looks weird?
00:21:05 No, I mean, like, people that I see on the street.
00:21:07 I mean, like, normal people.
00:21:09 Okay, all right, that's true, Ben.
00:21:11 I see them and, you know, they look ugly or whatever.
00:21:13 And that's fine, but, like,
00:21:15 it's not like that gives you an understanding
00:21:17 into what their life is like, because really, as you get older,
00:21:19 like, your appearance, honestly,
00:21:21 appearance really doesn't matter that much
00:21:23 on the grander scale things.
00:21:25 If you can, like, do the things you want,
00:21:27 you know, like, nobody's going to say,
00:21:29 like, oh, you're an ugly man,
00:21:31 you're an ugly old man, so, like,
00:21:33 your life must be shit.
00:21:35 Well, it's not about inferior.
00:21:37 It's own...
00:21:39 Yeah, like, two of these ugly people,
00:21:41 like, we're talking about older men, right?
00:21:43 So, like, two ugly older men,
00:21:45 I really doubt that it's that big a deal.
00:21:47 Like, Rupert Murdoch.
00:21:49 It might. It might.
00:21:51 And he's the ugliest motherfucker in the world.
00:21:53 Well, like, if you're that rich,
00:21:55 then probably it doesn't matter.
00:21:57 Okay, maybe that's a bad example, because he is super rich,
00:21:59 but I just don't think it's really, it really matters that much
00:22:01 past certain points.
00:22:03 I don't think it matters too much, either,
00:22:05 but I have a slightly different perception,
00:22:07 in English, and there's a thing that I've noticed.
00:22:09 And you want to talk about ugly, the English.
00:22:11 Yeah.
00:22:13 No, no, really, it's true.
00:22:15 The English, there's,
00:22:17 we have more of a tolerance for ugliness,
00:22:19 which is why ugly people
00:22:21 appear on British TV more than
00:22:23 they would otherwise in America.
00:22:25 Which is why there's that stereotype
00:22:27 of British people having bad teeth,
00:22:29 because if we have bad teeth,
00:22:31 you know, if you're like,
00:22:33 you got bad teeth, but you're a good news reporter,
00:22:35 you still get on the news,
00:22:37 and then Americans come over and say,
00:22:39 oh god, everyone in Britain's got fucked up teeth,
00:22:41 and that's why there's that whole thing.
00:22:43 It's just because we don't care so much.
00:22:45 I respect that.
00:22:47 I wish everyone were like that.
00:22:49 I wish I were more like that.
00:22:51 I mean, yeah,
00:22:53 I guess I'm pretty shallow.
00:22:55 Like, I don't like ugly people,
00:22:57 but I also hate beautiful,
00:22:59 I also hate beautiful people.
00:23:01 I hate everyone.
00:23:03 Yeah, I do. Anyone who's more attractive
00:23:05 or less attractive than me
00:23:07 is just always done.
00:23:09 They just get out of my fucking sight.
00:23:11 And you know, I don't want to exaggerate.
00:23:13 Like, there's a point where you're beyond
00:23:15 what's a comfortable level of ugliness for sure.
00:23:17 That's what I mean, right?
00:23:19 Like, if you get old,
00:23:21 well, I'm not even that far.
00:23:23 I don't know. If you get old,
00:23:25 and I get ugly,
00:23:27 and I become,
00:23:29 you know, unlovable,
00:23:31 I don't want that.
00:23:33 I don't even think there is a level of unlovable.
00:23:35 You can always find somebody,
00:23:37 even if you're like a freak.
00:23:39 Like, it's just a marathon
00:23:41 of looking past. I'm talking about, Nate,
00:23:43 I'm talking about bitches, Nate.
00:23:45 I'm talking about hot, young sluts.
00:23:47 I don't think
00:23:49 being...
00:23:51 I mean, some girls like older guys,
00:23:53 but not all of them.
00:23:55 So what I'm saying is, when you get older,
00:23:57 I think it does limit,
00:23:59 I think fewer...
00:24:01 Like, not none,
00:24:03 but fewer girls are going to be interested in you.
00:24:05 Like, the older you get.
00:24:07 Wouldn't those girls also not have been interested you
00:24:09 when you were young because they're into older guys,
00:24:11 so it kind of equals out?
00:24:13 Maybe. Maybe. I don't know.
00:24:15 But I still think the pool gets smaller.
00:24:17 Um...
00:24:19 I think it'll...
00:24:21 I've noticed this about myself.
00:24:23 You can overpower women.
00:24:25 You don't need to look...
00:24:27 You can just physically overpower them.
00:24:29 That's a good point.
00:24:31 But I just mean that,
00:24:33 as you get older,
00:24:35 I felt this about myself.
00:24:37 I just feel way more...
00:24:39 Don't give a shit, because I think
00:24:41 that I'm a cooler guy just
00:24:43 by having done more stuff in my life.
00:24:45 So I'm not really as concerned about
00:24:47 being able to physically impress people.
00:24:49 I just think, I know that I can...
00:24:51 I'm way cooler than these people.
00:24:53 They are going to be interested in me.
00:24:55 So I'm not...
00:24:57 You're already quite physically handsome, though.
00:24:59 I guess.
00:25:01 Not in a gay way.
00:25:03 You are a handsome boy, Nate.
00:25:05 You know those things?
00:25:07 Yeah. Well, that's good and all.
00:25:09 He kind of shrugs, no?
00:25:11 Well, you know.
00:25:13 It's hard to respond to something like that.
00:25:15 Because you're already attractive,
00:25:17 it's easy for you to say,
00:25:19 yeah, I don't really mind about my attractiveness.
00:25:21 Okay, let me flip that around.
00:25:23 People say that to me sometimes,
00:25:25 and it really does not
00:25:27 make a difference when you're out there
00:25:29 trying to get coups.
00:25:31 When you're in a club,
00:25:33 it does not matter
00:25:35 if you're in the top 10%
00:25:37 of attractive people in there, or whatever.
00:25:39 All that matters is if you get in there
00:25:41 and do what older guys
00:25:43 are better at of getting
00:25:45 attention, lording the club.
00:25:47 Lording the club.
00:25:49 And whatnot.
00:25:51 That's what it's about.
00:25:53 I think being attractive
00:25:55 does increase your chances,
00:25:57 but it's not the most important thing.
00:25:59 It's a small thing.
00:26:01 No, there are definitely girls
00:26:03 who will go for you
00:26:05 if you are handsome
00:26:07 that wouldn't if you weren't good looking.
00:26:09 There are definitely girls like that.
00:26:11 I would just argue that's a small number
00:26:13 by comparison to the people
00:26:15 who are just interested in meeting
00:26:17 an interesting individual who's fun
00:26:19 and exciting, whatever.
00:26:21 So my point, and the larger scale here
00:26:23 is just that there are benefits
00:26:25 to getting older that I think
00:26:27 kind of outweigh being younger.
00:26:29 I do completely agree with you
00:26:31 that the older I get, the less of a shit I give.
00:26:33 Yeah.
00:26:35 And that does kind of trump.
00:26:37 That's a big one.
00:26:39 That does kind of trump everything else.
00:26:41 Getting older gives you
00:26:43 perspective.
00:26:45 Ironically, I worried about
00:26:47 getting old way more when I was young.
00:26:49 Yeah.
00:26:51 Because back then, you thought all these...
00:26:53 You had less perspective, so these things seemed
00:26:55 like a bigger deal back then, probably.
00:26:57 Right. His part of
00:26:59 the whole getting old thing
00:27:01 is a...
00:27:03 is a...
00:27:05 believing that you...
00:27:07 This is what I did. I didn't worry about getting old
00:27:09 because of death.
00:27:11 I worried about getting old because
00:27:13 I was not skilled enough
00:27:15 for my current age, and I should have been doing stuff
00:27:17 earlier. Oh, yeah.
00:27:19 That's why.
00:27:21 If only I had... I was like this kid on YouTube
00:27:23 who's like five years old, and he's a really
00:27:25 really good guitarist.
00:27:27 He's like, holy shit, I'm not as good
00:27:29 as him. I should have been doing it from
00:27:31 earlier age, and now I'm fucked for the rest of my life.
00:27:33 That's a tough one. That's a tough one.
00:27:35 That really gets me a lot, but I tried
00:27:37 over the years to forget about it.
00:27:39 Here's the thing.
00:27:41 I have thought... I have thought
00:27:43 that I should be better than I am now
00:27:45 my entire life.
00:27:47 Yeah.
00:27:49 There was never a point where I was young enough
00:27:51 that I was like, you know,
00:27:53 at this age,
00:27:55 it's okay to be bad.
00:27:57 There's no... there's no being
00:27:59 young enough for that.
00:28:01 You should always be better
00:28:03 than what you are, right?
00:28:05 I mean, you always can be,
00:28:07 obviously, and there's always going to be somebody
00:28:09 better than you, so I guess I'm just saying
00:28:11 don't worry about it too much.
00:28:13 Just do what you can do right now.
00:28:15 I don't worry about it all that much,
00:28:17 but I still see people worrying about it
00:28:19 or just feeling like I'm not progressing
00:28:21 or I've waited too long and it's too late to start.
00:28:23 It's never too late to start.
00:28:25 I'm not saying that because it's like it's a big old
00:28:27 you can do it sort of message.
00:28:29 It's just literally not... it's never too late
00:28:31 to start. You can learn something
00:28:33 like a skill at 40 years old
00:28:35 and you can be really good at it
00:28:37 after 10 years.
00:28:39 There's another post I see that goes around
00:28:41 that lists like famous pieces
00:28:43 that were accomplished.
00:28:45 Harrison Ford's first acting gig
00:28:47 was when he was in his 30s
00:28:49 I think it wasn't Hansel.
00:28:51 Yeah, it was Hansel.
00:28:53 It was his first big thing.
00:28:55 Alan Rickman's first role.
00:28:57 He was like
00:28:59 an artist
00:29:01 or a programmer. I don't know.
00:29:03 He was some totally unrelated thing.
00:29:05 He just totally switched careers and became an actor
00:29:07 Wow, awesome.
00:29:09 Oprah Winfrey got fired from some
00:29:11 TV correspondent job
00:29:13 when she was like 30 something.
00:29:15 You know, there's a whole list
00:29:17 of...
00:29:19 I like that.
00:29:21 I just turned 26
00:29:23 and that's on the latter half of 20
00:29:25 so Doom begins to set in.
00:29:27 Sure.
00:29:29 People comment
00:29:31 sometimes that I sound younger than I am
00:29:33 or when I say that I'm 25
00:29:35 or 26 now.
00:29:37 They'll be like, wow, you're old, dude.
00:29:39 I did not expect her to be that old.
00:29:41 It's like, okay.
00:29:43 Some people
00:29:45 thought we were teens
00:29:47 when they heard T-Bab.
00:29:49 I remember when we did our Q&A
00:29:51 people were like, you guys are like
00:29:53 in your 20s, what the fuck?
00:29:55 Well, our audience
00:29:57 was pretty young.
00:29:59 On the net balance it was pretty young
00:30:01 so they probably assumed we were close to their age
00:30:03 because we shared their shitty...
00:30:05 No, not because we shared their interests.
00:30:07 Man, you know, even back then
00:30:09 I remember never saying that I was a brony.
00:30:11 And I, you know,
00:30:13 I was never one of you people.
00:30:15 Just letting you know.
00:30:17 Just putting that out there.
00:30:19 Anyway, let's move on.
00:30:21 God damn it's phone.
00:30:23 Just destroy the phone.
00:30:25 Ben, are you getting messages?
00:30:27 Are those threatening messages you're receiving?
00:30:29 No, there's updates for his age.
00:30:31 He's getting older by the minute.
00:30:33 Because, you know, guys,
00:30:35 we've been getting some weird messages lately
00:30:37 from these guys calling themselves the CMC.
00:30:39 The Crow...
00:30:41 The Crow Masticators, you know.
00:30:43 They've been...
00:30:45 Wait, wait, the CMC?
00:30:47 Dark Reflection.
00:30:49 Yeah, yeah.
00:30:51 Are you sure you don't mean the Cutie Mark Crusaders?
00:30:53 Oh, no.
00:30:55 Cutie Mark Crusaders have teamed up
00:30:57 with a murder of crows
00:30:59 to undermine our whole operation.
00:31:01 The CMC, the Crow Masticators
00:31:03 are a flock of vicious,
00:31:05 carnivorous birds.
00:31:07 Yeah, a murder, you might say.
00:31:09 A murder of crows.
00:31:11 They've set out to devour
00:31:13 our YouTube subs
00:31:15 and our flesh.
00:31:17 Yes.
00:31:19 And right now,
00:31:21 their current attempt is to just...
00:31:23 Both of which we are rich in.
00:31:25 Yeah, that's right.
00:31:27 It's just to ping Ben's phone mercilessly
00:31:29 to undermine our brilliant...
00:31:31 Let me check my text.
00:31:33 Come outside, Ben, we're hungry.
00:31:35 All day and all night,
00:31:37 this keeps up.
00:31:39 The Crow Masticators, yeah.
00:31:41 One day I'll...
00:31:43 One day I'll get old
00:31:45 and decrepit and slow enough
00:31:47 and they'll catch me and they'll be able to catch me
00:31:49 on the street, but for now, I'm safe.
00:31:51 You see, that's why it's all related.
00:31:53 We can't get old because then the fucking crows
00:31:55 will devour our bodies.
00:31:57 All it takes is one slip up.
00:31:59 Let your guard down for an instant.
00:32:01 This is PCP cannon, people.
00:32:03 Put it on the books.
00:32:05 Put it in the wiki.
00:32:07 We've got an evil...
00:32:09 Evil alter enemy
00:32:11 guy, Crows.
00:32:13 A murder of crows, yeah.
00:32:15 Yeah, they are a murder of crows.
00:32:17 That wacky CMC.
00:32:19 Oh, and also, they're forever young.
00:32:21 It's terrible.
00:32:23 They found the fountain of youth.
00:32:25 As one crow dies,
00:32:27 it's simply replaced by a new crow.
00:32:29 It's a constantly...
00:32:31 ebbing and flowing cycle
00:32:33 of death that's
00:32:35 trying to devour us.
00:32:37 I totally forget where we were.
00:32:39 Goddamn it, me too.
00:32:41 Because your goddamn poem was interrupting us.
00:32:45 Fuck.
00:32:47 Let me completely segue.
00:32:49 I watched this...
00:32:51 show. It was a Japanese...
00:32:53 I guess you could call it a documentary.
00:32:55 Where this one mangaka
00:32:57 he, like,
00:32:59 puts cameras in other mangaka's
00:33:01 studios
00:33:03 and films them working
00:33:05 and then, like, a month later,
00:33:07 him and the other guy watch it together
00:33:09 and, like, talk about their workflow
00:33:11 and process and stuff. Oh, that's cool.
00:33:13 It was very cool, but I was shocked
00:33:15 at how fucking old they all were.
00:33:17 All these... they were all...
00:33:19 Like, the youngest guy
00:33:21 that I saw on there
00:33:23 was the guy who did
00:33:25 motherfucking...
00:33:27 or, I assume, a poon-poon.
00:33:29 And he's, like, phone
00:33:31 and he's...
00:33:33 And he's, like,
00:33:35 35.
00:33:37 He's been at it for a while, though.
00:33:41 And, like,
00:33:43 the guy doing the show is, like,
00:33:45 in his 50s and, like,
00:33:47 the...
00:33:49 And he's still going at it.
00:33:51 They all looked really youthful.
00:33:53 They all looked really vigorous.
00:33:55 Well, they're Asians, you know.
00:33:57 Yeah, maybe. But there was one guy
00:33:59 one episode of it
00:34:01 was this one, like, older guy
00:34:03 who did this famous thing.
00:34:05 Gogo9?
00:34:07 I don't know it.
00:34:09 It's about this assassin.
00:34:11 This, like, really tough assassin guy.
00:34:13 And, all right, this guy was, like,
00:34:15 78, right?
00:34:17 And he got on the show
00:34:19 and one of the things that they talked about
00:34:21 were, like,
00:34:23 yeah, people say I don't even draw anymore
00:34:25 but that's totally not true.
00:34:27 People say,
00:34:29 sorry, that I only draw the eyes or whatever.
00:34:31 And everyone's, like,
00:34:33 well, we'll prove them wrong with this footage.
00:34:35 And then, okay,
00:34:37 all the other footage of the guy
00:34:39 showed them, like, working, like, you know, all day
00:34:41 drawing, like, page after page, right?
00:34:43 This guy, this 78-year-old guy,
00:34:45 he goes into his desk, he sits down,
00:34:47 he draws, like, two pictures, right?
00:34:49 He does, like, he draws, like,
00:34:51 one portrait
00:34:53 of the main character from one of his series
00:34:55 and one portrait of the main character from another.
00:34:57 And that's it.
00:34:59 And then he draws, like, a storyboard,
00:35:01 but it's super bare bones. It's all text, right?
00:35:03 Like, this guy is not working
00:35:05 at the same rate as the other guys.
00:35:07 And he takes these super bare bones
00:35:09 storyboards and he hands them off to his assistants
00:35:11 and they give him back, like,
00:35:13 fully finished pages. And all he does
00:35:15 is he doesn't even
00:35:17 just draw the eyes, like the rumors say.
00:35:19 He just goes in and he just draws in, like, the sound effects
00:35:21 over the fully finished, that's, like, all he did
00:35:23 on the fully finished pages.
00:35:25 So, alright.
00:35:27 The start off being, like,
00:35:29 people say, I don't still draw,
00:35:31 but I do. And then he kind of goes in,
00:35:33 draws these two pictures, sort of makes a show
00:35:35 that he can still draw. Like, obviously, he can still do it.
00:35:37 But then they show him actually working
00:35:39 and he doesn't. He isn't.
00:35:41 The rumors are completely true.
00:35:43 He doesn't, in fact, draw his shit, but...
00:35:45 So what you're saying is
00:35:47 old people don't... In the end,
00:35:49 in the end, I think what the impression
00:35:51 I came away with is that, like,
00:35:53 these rumors that he doesn't draw
00:35:55 seem to be completely true
00:35:57 and founded, but it's
00:35:59 cruel to, like,
00:36:01 hold that against him because the guy
00:36:03 was, like, 78 years old.
00:36:05 The guy had to, like,
00:36:07 really slow walking around.
00:36:09 He had to, like, take naps in the middle of drawing.
00:36:11 Like, you know, yeah,
00:36:13 this guy isn't putting out work
00:36:15 at the same rate as these younger people.
00:36:17 But, like, seeing him in action,
00:36:19 why would you expect him to, right?
00:36:21 And, like, the guy is still
00:36:23 putting in... The guy is still working
00:36:25 to the top of his ability. I don't know.
00:36:27 I guess... It was interesting.
00:36:29 And I guess that brings me to,
00:36:31 yeah, one thing that I do worry about
00:36:33 with getting old is that, you know,
00:36:35 you're less capable and you can't do the things
00:36:37 that you want to do anymore.
00:36:39 As I recall, there's a great line that I...
00:36:41 This guy was definitely slowing down.
00:36:43 Did you watch Shirobako, Ben?
00:36:45 Yeah. Well, yeah, yeah, I did. I did.
00:36:47 So there's the... I didn't finish it,
00:36:49 but Digi has just told me this line
00:36:51 and really made an impression on me of this old dude
00:36:53 who insists, and I think you talked about this a bunch, too,
00:36:55 who insists that you have to get fast
00:36:57 at drawing when you're young, because as you get older
00:36:59 you only get slower. So it's important
00:37:01 to turn that skill up.
00:37:03 That's the kind of line
00:37:05 that really gives me fucking
00:37:07 nightmare triggers.
00:37:09 That's the kind of thing that someone can say
00:37:11 that really fucking shakes me to my very core.
00:37:13 Yeah.
00:37:15 That is, like, the big thing that's, like,
00:37:17 the antithesis to the idea that you can start
00:37:19 a skill whenever.
00:37:21 Like, some things you literally can't
00:37:23 because of, I don't know, your hands
00:37:25 gets too shaky that you can't draw.
00:37:27 But I like
00:37:29 to think that
00:37:31 as long as you, you know, try
00:37:33 you can be decent
00:37:35 enough from any age.
00:37:37 Like, if you do start
00:37:39 when you're, like, a teenager,
00:37:41 you start doing a skill and you do it forever,
00:37:43 you're gonna be one of the best in the world.
00:37:45 You're gonna be, like, one of the Beatles
00:37:47 or something.
00:37:49 Even if you
00:37:51 say you start really late
00:37:53 and you're slow and you never get fast,
00:37:55 right?
00:37:57 That's not a death sentence.
00:37:59 Like, some people can be slow,
00:38:01 but good, right?
00:38:03 Like, some people can be successful
00:38:05 despite being, like, George R. R. Martin
00:38:07 is not a fast guy.
00:38:09 Yeah, right, right.
00:38:11 Though it did take him, like, 30 years for anyone to give a shit.
00:38:13 I mean, on a large scale.
00:38:15 Yeah, but still.
00:38:17 I mean, he was making a living off of it,
00:38:19 like, his whole life.
00:38:21 That's true. So, I mean, really, that's, I'm sure,
00:38:23 his larger goal, just to be able to do it.
00:38:25 And he did it, so, you know.
00:38:27 He's fake. Like, I just remember
00:38:29 really liking that he struggled with his speed
00:38:31 for a long time, and it took him
00:38:33 years to achieve
00:38:35 a speed he was comfortable with. And even then,
00:38:37 he didn't get as fast, ever,
00:38:39 as A.G., as the, like, the genius did.
00:38:41 Yeah, yeah.
00:38:43 Crowman. Oh, my God.
00:38:45 The head of the CMC, the head of the
00:38:47 Crowmasters, A.G.
00:38:49 from Bakuman. Oh, my God!
00:38:51 That fucking
00:38:53 bitch killed that guy.
00:38:55 Yeah, I just,
00:38:57 I'm glad that the series
00:38:59 touched on that. It didn't really
00:39:01 to my satisfaction address
00:39:03 how he got good, other than he just kept
00:39:05 doing it. He just kept doing it,
00:39:07 which is good, and I guess probably
00:39:09 is all it takes. You just keep doing it.
00:39:11 You're gonna figure out tips and tricks
00:39:13 to one weird old tip to draw
00:39:15 fast. Yeah, like,
00:39:17 you don't get to,
00:39:19 this isn't really an age thing,
00:39:21 but just in general, you don't get to choose
00:39:23 what you're good at and
00:39:25 what your strengths are and what capabilities
00:39:27 you have. Like, by doing
00:39:29 the work and starting things
00:39:31 and doing things, you have to discover
00:39:33 them and then work around them.
00:39:35 Yeah, definitely true.
00:39:37 I think one thing,
00:39:39 yeah, go on, go on.
00:39:41 One thing I've, with regards
00:39:43 to being slow
00:39:45 if you start late
00:39:47 or never being quite
00:39:49 the best ever is something
00:39:51 that I've always, like, I don't like
00:39:53 the idea of not being the best, because I'm very
00:39:55 competitive. I always want to be
00:39:57 the best at everything I do, but I'm obviously
00:39:59 not, you know, because I don't,
00:40:01 I try lots of different things.
00:40:03 Well, I don't necessarily agree with that.
00:40:05 I mean, I think you're,
00:40:07 at what you specifically do, I think you
00:40:09 are the best, because
00:40:11 only you can do exactly
00:40:13 what it is you do. That's too
00:40:15 your narrow definition.
00:40:17 What I mean is,
00:40:19 like,
00:40:21 I forgot.
00:40:23 Sorry. What I mean is
00:40:25 something about
00:40:27 being not good
00:40:29 at all. You're saying you want to be the best.
00:40:31 Yeah. Like no one ever was.
00:40:33 Right. No, well, okay,
00:40:35 sure.
00:40:37 I want to be really good. I want to be the,
00:40:39 jack of all trades, that's what I was going to say. I'm more
00:40:41 of a jack of all trades. I do, I dip
00:40:43 my fingers into a lot of different
00:40:45 pots. And a lot of
00:40:47 pussies.
00:40:49 Wow.
00:40:51 Yes, great.
00:40:53 Draw that fan artist.
00:40:57 Yeah, yeah, draw it.
00:41:01 So I'm good at lots of things,
00:41:03 but I'm not, like, really, really good
00:41:05 at one thing, which is what I want,
00:41:07 because I feel like I want
00:41:09 to be better than everyone in one field.
00:41:11 Yeah. And there's always somebody better
00:41:13 than me, and it didn't always be me.
00:41:15 You know, I get that.
00:41:17 I get, you know, people say you got to pick one thing
00:41:19 and be the best at it. And that's,
00:41:21 I understand that.
00:41:23 I,
00:41:25 I mean, I think, I think that my
00:41:27 specialty was probably
00:41:29 is like, you know, would be art,
00:41:31 and like actually like, like actual drawing
00:41:33 part of the art is like the thing that I'm
00:41:35 best at. But I'm not the best at it.
00:41:37 But I am comfortable
00:41:39 with not being the best at that.
00:41:41 I am, I'm, what I was saying before,
00:41:43 I am comfortable with being
00:41:45 the best at, you know,
00:41:47 my own particular blend
00:41:49 of, you know,
00:41:51 writing
00:41:53 slash drawing, slash storytelling,
00:41:55 slash directing, slash humor,
00:41:57 slash, you know, whatever.
00:41:59 I'm, I think that's all,
00:42:01 that's all I want to be is just,
00:42:03 you know, it's like, it's like Jesse,
00:42:05 it's like Jesse always says, I'm the best
00:42:07 at what I do, even if what I do isn't very cool.
00:42:09 I, I'm totally cool
00:42:11 with being that. Yeah.
00:42:13 I mean, I'm not cool with that,
00:42:15 because that's a boring, dumb definition
00:42:17 that is useless because
00:42:19 it's too specific. Well, but that's the only definition that you'll ever get
00:42:21 to be the best at, so.
00:42:23 Yeah, but that's dumb. You should aspire
00:42:25 to greater heights to be the best.
00:42:27 But you're always competing with yourself.
00:42:29 When I'm watching like your, your draw vlogs
00:42:31 Ben, I see yourself,
00:42:33 I see you drawing and like, and you're like,
00:42:35 I don't know about this, this, this
00:42:37 doesn't look good. And I'm like, hmm,
00:42:39 I want to be a drawer guy. I want to make
00:42:41 a comic just so I can say I'm better
00:42:43 than you. Not because I have,
00:42:45 not because I'm being
00:42:47 That's a fine motivation. I just, I,
00:42:49 watching you work makes me want to be
00:42:51 better. I don't know.
00:42:53 Watching anybody do anything wants me,
00:42:55 wants me to feel like I,
00:42:57 because I'm really competitive. I really want
00:42:59 to just beat everyone all the time.
00:43:01 It's good to watch people working hard
00:43:03 at things that they want to do.
00:43:05 So it's, it's not like, um,
00:43:07 I feel like you suck
00:43:09 because you don't. You're really good.
00:43:11 It's just, I want to
00:43:13 I want, I want to make a comic
00:43:15 god damn it. And I know
00:43:17 I need a lot of practice before I can really
00:43:19 do that. Back when I, no, you don't.
00:43:21 I don't, you don't. Just do it.
00:43:23 Just, I'm sorry.
00:43:25 I'll do it. Sorry if that was
00:43:27 patronizing. No, no, it wasn't.
00:43:29 Okay. Um, back
00:43:31 Speaking of patronizing, everybody
00:43:33 head on over to patreon.com
00:43:35 slash best guy ever. The only place
00:43:37 to give me all your money.
00:43:39 No, it's mine. You failed the meme.
00:43:41 I'm modifying the meme to give me the money now.
00:43:43 You know, you know, Nate, I heard that if you pledge
00:43:45 now on best guy ever, you get
00:43:47 50% off on plates and silverware at Target.
00:43:49 Is that true? That's, that's, I can confirm
00:43:51 that that is indeed not true, but
00:43:53 you can do it anyway. Oh well.
00:43:55 If you go and tell them that, maybe they'll fall
00:43:57 for it. Yeah, sure.
00:43:59 You can't afford
00:44:01 me.
00:44:03 Viewers, you can't afford
00:44:05 not to pledge or can
00:44:07 you?
00:44:09 A brilliant marketing strategy.
00:44:11 Hey, you know, I was going to
00:44:13 say before, I just wanted to clarify
00:44:15 that I don't think it's
00:44:17 like bad or anything to
00:44:19 to be the best at what you do. It's just
00:44:21 I also see myself as the
00:44:23 best at what I do and I just
00:44:25 don't find a lot of usefulness
00:44:27 from that mentality just because
00:44:29 like, yeah, people generally
00:44:31 seem to like what I do, but I
00:44:33 looking at myself, I see all the ways
00:44:35 that I'm inadequate in other things
00:44:37 that I need to improve on. We all do that.
00:44:39 We're all thinking like, I'm great
00:44:41 but I could be better than me.
00:44:43 I have to set my own bar
00:44:45 higher. Well, I like to compare myself to
00:44:47 other people in the ways that they are good
00:44:49 that I want to, you know, do
00:44:51 like Digi's work ethic and just his
00:44:53 his rate of output is
00:44:55 something that I want to achieve or, you know,
00:44:57 get closer to because that's really
00:44:59 important on the market of YouTube and, you know,
00:45:01 just things like that are what I
00:45:03 think about when I think about this stuff.
00:45:07 Was this on topic?
00:45:09 I'm with you. Actually, no.
00:45:11 Kind of. Okay.
00:45:15 Who cares? Well, okay, let me
00:45:17 kind of segue into something that is a little
00:45:19 related. I
00:45:21 used to watch, like a couple years ago,
00:45:23 I was watching a lot of like
00:45:25 drawing tutorials or like, you know,
00:45:27 draw
00:45:29 vlogs or things, kind of like what I'm
00:45:31 making now. And
00:45:33 I watched this. There was one guy in particular
00:45:35 named Sycra that I watched a lot
00:45:37 and, alright, Hippo, you said
00:45:39 like when you watch my draw vlog, you feel
00:45:41 like, oh, I want to be as good as
00:45:43 that guy. When I watched Sycra,
00:45:45 there was a bit of that, like, oh, I want
00:45:47 to be this good, but it also gave me
00:45:49 a sensation that was like
00:45:51 I am
00:45:53 this good, like when I
00:45:55 and at the time he was way better than me, like when I
00:45:57 watched Sycra draw,
00:45:59 I would feel as though I was
00:46:01 drawing it and I would be like, oh,
00:46:03 I've seen how he does it. Well,
00:46:05 I could do it too now. Like there's
00:46:07 now like now that I've seen it, there's nothing
00:46:09 to it. Yeah, that's a lot.
00:46:11 A lot of it is just knowledge base and under
00:46:13 when you can break down something like what's somebody
00:46:15 like like Brian Leo Malley or something
00:46:17 and like watch him draw something and you see, oh,
00:46:19 there's nothing magical about this.
00:46:21 He just went through the steps like everybody else. That's
00:46:23 a useful thing, I think. On the one hand,
00:46:25 it's true. Like there's no trick to it.
00:46:27 You just do it. On the other
00:46:29 hand, I was totally wrong because
00:46:31 like I felt like I could go
00:46:33 and draw this thing because I just seem, but like
00:46:35 it wasn't true. I definitely could not
00:46:37 have done what he was doing
00:46:39 then and probably still not now because
00:46:41 that guy is really great.
00:46:43 But anyway,
00:46:45 yeah, Sycra, now there's a guy listening to
00:46:47 his life story. They told
00:46:49 him he
00:46:51 he's kind of like me.
00:46:53 He was, I mean, he drew a little as a kid
00:46:55 but then he was like, he was in, I think
00:46:57 he was like 21 or 22
00:46:59 when he like decided to
00:47:01 he went and found like a tutor
00:47:03 or like a personal art like mentor
00:47:05 and was like
00:47:07 I want to learn how to draw and be really good at
00:47:09 drawing and they told him at the age
00:47:11 of like 22, like you're too old.
00:47:13 What a fucking bitch.
00:47:15 Like you've passed the prime
00:47:17 time in your life to like become
00:47:19 good or fast or whatever, like
00:47:21 if you really want to do it, you can
00:47:23 do it, but like, yeah, and he was like
00:47:25 I don't care.
00:47:27 Good friend. I think he's like
00:47:29 he's probably maybe like 31 or 32
00:47:31 or something like that now.
00:47:33 It's not even old at all.
00:47:35 Yeah, and that was earlier than me.
00:47:37 I mean, I drew a little bit, but I didn't really
00:47:39 start taking it seriously until I was
00:47:41 like 25, but I don't know.
00:47:43 I'm happy with the progress I've made
00:47:45 since then. Yeah.
00:47:47 Getting
00:47:49 never too late people, you know, like
00:47:51 I said, like, like
00:47:53 and my whole life, like even in like
00:47:55 high school, I would sit down and
00:47:57 sometimes I would I didn't draw that much back then
00:47:59 but I would often like want to
00:48:01 I would like think about doing it or maybe I would
00:48:03 start and then I would be like, oh, this isn't
00:48:05 coming out good immediately. I give up
00:48:07 you know, like in a second
00:48:09 and even back then
00:48:11 when I was like 16, 17, I was like, man,
00:48:13 I could have been drawing my
00:48:15 entire life. I could have been drawing since I was
00:48:17 10 years old. I could be like good right now
00:48:19 but I'm not. Yeah.
00:48:21 So, you know, I've fucked it up. I've wasted my
00:48:23 time. I've wasted my potential.
00:48:25 Fuck it. I give up.
00:48:27 Yeah, I think everybody has those feelings.
00:48:29 Yeah, yeah, but it ain't good.
00:48:31 And moreover, it's not
00:48:33 true.
00:48:35 It's not true. I don't believe that anymore.
00:48:37 You know, I remember when we were young and
00:48:39 we were both in high school, I think, at the time
00:48:41 and you drew like everyone's
00:48:43 D characters in this like
00:48:45 particular like RPG based
00:48:47 style as I call it. Yeah, on like graph
00:48:49 paper. Like you're a little tiny
00:48:51 like RPG maker sprite looking
00:48:53 dudes. Yep. That was awesome.
00:48:55 And I gave them all, you know, they were
00:48:57 I gave them all little
00:48:59 color scheme, little
00:49:01 individual color schemes, like elemental themes. They were really
00:49:03 simple. And then someone like
00:49:05 at school, someone like
00:49:07 accidentally like ripped it, like
00:49:09 like it got like a rip in it because like
00:49:11 someone like was being careless with it.
00:49:13 And I was like, and I was like,
00:49:15 dude, you just rip my drawing
00:49:17 and he and he looked at it.
00:49:19 Yeah, this was not a guy I respected,
00:49:21 by the way, his opinion did not did not
00:49:23 hold much weight for me, but he he
00:49:25 he got defensive about it. He tried
00:49:27 to like play it off like, oh, it's not a big deal.
00:49:29 Why are you mad? I didn't do anything wrong. And he was like,
00:49:31 dude, do you know how easy that would be to
00:49:33 draw? Well, I wasn't
00:49:35 even mad. I was just like
00:49:37 I didn't say this at the time because
00:49:39 I had no idea how to respond to this, but like,
00:49:41 yeah, I do because
00:49:43 I drew it and like, sure
00:49:45 it's simple, but like I spent time on
00:49:47 it. You ding it. There was
00:49:49 like 12 characters on there, like 10 of them
00:49:51 or something. I wasn't it was
00:49:53 so stupid. It was such a stupid thing
00:49:55 to say that it didn't even make me mad. I
00:49:57 was just like, how can he
00:49:59 that there's how that's a guy
00:50:01 right there without a creative bone
00:50:03 in his body or at least not thinking about it
00:50:05 in those ways. I don't know. He was
00:50:07 thinking back. He was deaf. He was definitely
00:50:09 like making sort of a knee jerk
00:50:11 reflexive defensive thing, like
00:50:13 trying to deflect.
00:50:15 At that moment, he wasn't thinking about
00:50:17 what it means to be a creator. So fuck that guy.
00:50:19 Oh, definitely not.
00:50:21 Do you know
00:50:23 how easy that would be to draw? Yes, I do
00:50:25 actually.
00:50:27 There's a sort of
00:50:29 a related thing
00:50:31 in that
00:50:33 the not not finishing
00:50:35 projects is something that I've struggled
00:50:37 with a lot. Oh, man.
00:50:39 Not finishing projects.
00:50:41 But I feel like a lot
00:50:43 of the time, the projects that
00:50:45 I wouldn't have done much with anyway, like
00:50:47 when I did that homestuck
00:50:49 fan comic. Yeah.
00:50:51 I was going to have the whole of the horseshoe
00:50:53 crew as characters and do a whole
00:50:55 thing. But then I realized
00:50:57 why would I spend so much time doing a homestuck
00:50:59 comic when I could just make a real
00:51:01 comic. Yeah, fair point.
00:51:03 Agreed. As much as I hate
00:51:05 unfinished shit,
00:51:07 there's probably better things
00:51:09 you could be doing. Though not to discourage
00:51:11 people from, like, if you're starting from zero,
00:51:13 go for it. Like, take your time
00:51:15 and go ahead and do that shit. Like, I mean, I
00:51:17 did, like, that illustrated homestuck
00:51:19 RP, Spurg, and
00:51:21 I spent, like, it went on for like
00:51:23 two years. But I stuck
00:51:25 with it and I fucking, because
00:51:27 I had put so much effort into it
00:51:29 by the, by the end
00:51:31 I was like, I can't give up.
00:51:33 I have to finish it. And it was
00:51:35 wicked hard. I really had to fucking
00:51:37 kick myself to do it, but I finally did.
00:51:39 And, and it's good.
00:51:41 Um, Jeff.
00:51:43 Finishing things is so important.
00:51:45 Finishing things is, is, it
00:51:47 makes you feel good, you know, even if it's not
00:51:49 very, like a, like, I've,
00:51:51 I've had multimedia fusion too, which is
00:51:53 like a video game creation
00:51:55 application thing. And I've
00:51:57 made tons of games.
00:51:59 One or two that I actually finished
00:52:01 and hundreds that are just like,
00:52:03 we've never seen any of those, man. I want to see
00:52:05 them. Yeah. If I, if there was a good way
00:52:07 to record them and if I could find them
00:52:09 then yes, I'll try and do, I kind
00:52:11 of want to make a, a hypocrite video about
00:52:13 them. Yeah. Great. I'd love that.
00:52:15 Yeah. But yeah, I've, I've
00:52:17 done loads of things. I've tried writing
00:52:19 songs. I've recorded like hundreds, well
00:52:21 not hundreds, but like lots of songs,
00:52:23 lots of different guitarists, never any
00:52:25 lyrics. But the things
00:52:27 I have completed, like that one album I
00:52:29 did when I was sick, I, I stuck with it.
00:52:31 I made a song every day
00:52:33 for seven days until I got better,
00:52:35 which just so happened to be an exact
00:52:37 week and, and ended on this day
00:52:39 Homestuck ended, which was weird. Oh yeah.
00:52:41 And I liked that album and I went and fucking bought
00:52:43 it. I bought your album. Something I
00:52:45 have never done is buy an
00:52:47 album, but I bought your fucking album
00:52:49 hippo. And it was worth it.
00:52:51 On bandcamp.com
00:52:53 slash Hippocrite or something. Yes.
00:52:55 Yeah, but
00:52:57 that, that album, because it was finished,
00:52:59 it's like, I like it, even
00:53:01 though some of the songs are kind of whatever.
00:53:03 Yeah. It's cool. Yeah, it's great.
00:53:05 I mean, like,
00:53:07 you're never going to, you're never going to be totally
00:53:09 happy with the work of art, but
00:53:11 it's fine, right?
00:53:13 Like, you still, you still got to finish it.
00:53:15 I think the first real creative
00:53:17 endeavor I did was in college
00:53:19 when me and my buddy Rich, just
00:53:21 you know, we, we both wanted to make video games.
00:53:23 We were programming guys. We just decided
00:53:25 to make one. And we
00:53:27 just spent the next year slowly chipping
00:53:29 away at this RPG maker
00:53:31 like puzzle drama
00:53:33 kind of game. And we finished it.
00:53:35 It's called Bell. Man, I bet I have
00:53:37 a download link. I could probably put it in the fucking
00:53:39 description of this if I can get that shit. You know, I never
00:53:41 actually finished it. It's really
00:53:43 hard. It's really hard and like
00:53:45 not super clear. But we made
00:53:47 it that way on purpose. I would have played that game again though.
00:53:49 Oh yeah, I did some sprites for that, didn't I?
00:53:51 You sure did. You made like a blanket that was
00:53:53 folded on itself and like I think like a paper
00:53:55 plane or something. Yeah, you made stuff. And Grace
00:53:57 our sister made some shit for that
00:53:59 and me and Rich worked on it for a million fucking years.
00:54:01 She like painted the backgrounds, right?
00:54:03 She made some art
00:54:05 that there was like cut scene art that's
00:54:07 not so great. But I remember
00:54:09 thinking it was not that good. No offense to you, Grace.
00:54:11 It's not very good. It's not
00:54:13 She's done, she's drawn way better
00:54:15 stuff. She's much better now. Yeah, this is
00:54:17 this was years ago. But yeah, like
00:54:19 just the fact that it's done, I've got a finished
00:54:21 game that's just out there that people
00:54:23 have played, you know, not many of them and it's not
00:54:25 great, but it's constantly
00:54:27 giving me a source of joy from like ever since
00:54:29 it's been done for the last like eight years. So
00:54:31 you know, it's not eight years.
00:54:33 Oh, maybe like six.
00:54:35 We did that sophomore year
00:54:37 of college and it's been like, that's
00:54:39 like six, probably six years, maybe five.
00:54:41 That does not feel
00:54:43 like it was six years ago that I drew this.
00:54:45 Yeah, I know. Well, oh,
00:54:47 I feel so old now.
00:54:49 There it is.
00:54:51 Yeah, we're way off topic, but
00:54:53 while we're on this on subject of finishing
00:54:55 things, I have two things to say. One,
00:54:57 I think that finishing things,
00:54:59 just the act of finishing things
00:55:01 is a skill in and of itself
00:55:03 and you need to practice it
00:55:05 by finishing things, even if they're bad.
00:55:07 Finishing them is important just
00:55:09 to fucking get
00:55:11 just to, you know, get experience points
00:55:13 to put into your finishing things skill
00:55:15 because finishing things is the most
00:55:17 important thing. Because if the experience points don't go
00:55:19 to that, they go to the giving up on
00:55:21 shit skill and you don't want to train that
00:55:23 too much. Yeah.
00:55:25 They're learned. They're both learned. Giving up
00:55:27 and finishing things are both learned behaviors
00:55:29 and you need to practice.
00:55:31 You got to like, like your brain is plastic,
00:55:33 right? Like the more you do a thing,
00:55:35 the more your brain synapses reroute
00:55:37 themselves to like more easily
00:55:39 like route you towards doing
00:55:41 that same thing. Yep. So like the more
00:55:43 you do a thing, the more you're
00:55:45 going to be inclined to do that
00:55:47 same thing. So you need to not give up.
00:55:49 You know what it's like? You need to finish a thing
00:55:51 in order to change your brain.
00:55:53 Life is an RPG
00:55:55 and like most RPGs, it's hard
00:55:57 to reallocate your stats.
00:55:59 Specifically, it's like Final Fantasy 6
00:56:01 where you've got the chicken knife
00:56:03 and the brave sword and when you run
00:56:05 from battle, when you run from battles
00:56:07 your chicken knife gets way more powerful
00:56:09 and that's giving up. But if you stay
00:56:11 and fight every battle, your brave sword
00:56:13 never gets less powerful and it stays
00:56:15 one of the best weapons in the game
00:56:17 and that's finishing stuff. So don't run
00:56:19 away from battles, people. Don't raise that
00:56:21 chicken knife, even though in the game the chicken knife
00:56:23 is way more powerful potentially. Keep your
00:56:25 brave sword strong. It's not a perfect
00:56:27 metaphor. It's not a perfect metaphor.
00:56:29 It's a terrible one. It's in fact the worst
00:56:31 metaphor. It's the exact opposite.
00:56:35 Alright. Wait, wait, there's one more thing
00:56:37 I want to say about that. The reason why
00:56:39 you've got to learn to finish things is
00:56:41 because finishing things is the most important
00:56:43 because as Brian Leo Malley, creator
00:56:45 of Scott Pilgrim once said on his
00:56:47 Tumblr or something
00:56:49 or something, he said
00:56:51 anything finished
00:56:53 is better than anything unfinished.
00:56:55 Like no matter how bad a
00:56:57 thing is, if you finish it
00:56:59 it's something. If you don't
00:57:01 finish it, no matter how good it could
00:57:03 have been, it's only potential.
00:57:05 It's nothing. It's garbage. I like that
00:57:07 message. Yeah. If you don't
00:57:09 finish a thing, it's garbage.
00:57:11 If you do finish it, it's
00:57:13 at least a non-zero value.
00:57:15 You've at least created something.
00:57:17 So that's the most important thing.
00:57:19 Thanks, Brian Leo Malley.
00:57:21 That quote is really stuck
00:57:23 with me ever since I read it. I don't
00:57:25 know, however many years ago.
00:57:27 It's so important. I'm going to go make a comic
00:57:29 after this. I'm going to make it. It's going to be
00:57:31 10 page comic. That's my goal.
00:57:33 That's your goal. That's a good goal.
00:57:35 We could probably do that in a week.
00:57:37 The page is going to be one pixel
00:57:39 wide.
00:57:41 You could do that in one minute.
00:57:43 You broke the system.
00:57:45 Well, that's good, Gib. Yes.
00:57:47 Do that.
00:57:49 After you both finish the project
00:57:51 that we're working on aside from this shit.
00:57:53 Do that first. Actually, we can't do it
00:57:55 until Ben does this shit, but whatever.
00:57:57 I will do my shit. We're so
00:57:59 off topic. We haven't
00:58:01 even been talking about it. It's sort of an inevitable
00:58:03 sort of thing from
00:58:05 complaining about getting old.
00:58:07 In itself,
00:58:09 people who complain about getting old, that
00:58:11 is not really much of a topic.
00:58:13 I don't like when they do that.
00:58:15 It's silly. I've got so much more to look
00:58:17 forward to. You shouldn't be sad.
00:58:19 Yeah.
00:58:21 When I was
00:58:23 where you were
00:58:25 saying before, Hippo, about
00:58:27 comparing yourself to people's
00:58:29 ages and being, oh, this person
00:58:31 was this far along when they did this.
00:58:33 I should be doing that at that age too.
00:58:35 Like Brian Leomali,
00:58:37 I think he was like 22
00:58:39 when he did
00:58:41 Lost at Sea, his
00:58:43 first full paperback that nobody fucking remembers.
00:58:45 And then I think he was
00:58:47 doing Scott Pilgrim between the ages of
00:58:49 like 23 and 27
00:58:51 or 8
00:58:53 or 29 or something like that.
00:58:55 So, I don't know. Think about that guy.
00:58:57 I mean, that guy had been drawing comics
00:58:59 since he was a little kid, but not anything
00:59:01 like publishable. And he'd only
00:59:03 really been working in the field.
00:59:05 I don't know, maybe when he was like 20 or something.
00:59:07 He was doing a little bit for some website or something.
00:59:09 So, I don't know.
00:59:11 I mean, Andrew Hussey. Andrew Hussey had been
00:59:13 drawing for years
00:59:15 and years. I mean, I think all of his old
00:59:17 black and white comics, like I think he did
00:59:19 whistles in his late 20s and I think
00:59:21 maybe he was doing things like
00:59:23 a steep price for
00:59:25 pie and like humanimals he was doing
00:59:27 maybe his early 20s and I think
00:59:29 I think he was maybe late 20s
00:59:31 when he did problem sleuth and I think
00:59:33 he was, I think he's maybe like 34
00:59:35 now. So, oh my god, I guess
00:59:37 he was, wait, maybe I have this all shifted
00:59:39 because I guess maybe he started
00:59:41 home stuck when he was like late 20s
00:59:43 or something. Well, do you know how old he is?
00:59:45 Yeah, the guy. He's like 7 years old.
00:59:47 Yeah, so I guess
00:59:49 I mean, I think he's like 33 or 35
00:59:51 right now. So, I don't know. So, he probably started
00:59:53 home stuck when he was about my age.
00:59:55 Although, I mean, he had been doing a lot of other stuff
00:59:57 before. Oh my god, jeez, that's
00:59:59 shit. He's, shit, he's younger than I thought.
01:00:01 God damn it.
01:00:03 Yeah, but we can't, you know,
01:00:05 we can't let everybody else who's older than
01:00:07 you when they started. So, you know, I'll just
01:00:09 think about that like, I'll just think about
01:00:11 that the 50 year old guy who was doing
01:00:13 that manga documentary.
01:00:15 By the way, that documentary about the
01:00:17 mangaka is called, it's called
01:00:19 manben, M-A-N-B-E-N
01:00:21 and you can find it on Dailymotion.
01:00:23 There's like 7 episodes, I think.
01:00:25 That's cool.
01:00:27 The best one is about the Oyasumi
01:00:29 Poon Poon guy. And it's like,
01:00:31 I don't know, the guy
01:00:33 the 50 year old guy who's
01:00:35 a host who's like, he's still totally
01:00:37 active in the field. He's totally, you know,
01:00:39 vibrant and vigorous and working away.
01:00:41 He like talks to this like 35 year old
01:00:43 guy like, oh, you know, you're a young guy.
01:00:45 You're like part of the new guard. I'm like, that guy's
01:00:47 like 10 years older than me. Awesome.
01:00:49 I can still be, I can
01:00:51 still be like a, I can still be
01:00:53 like a young, like, you know,
01:00:55 part of the new guard
01:00:57 when I'm like 35.
01:00:59 Like that's normal. Cause like I'm saying,
01:01:01 no matter what age you are, you're young
01:01:03 compared to those older than you. You know what I always thought was weird?
01:01:05 You know how Blackbeard
01:01:07 in One Piece is like an old ass bitch
01:01:09 and yet he's part of the worst
01:01:11 he's like a new hot pirate
01:01:13 despite being an old ass man.
01:01:15 That's inspiring to me. He's like the most
01:01:17 powerful man in the world and he's an old ass bitch.
01:01:19 He's, he's, he's older.
01:01:21 Well, no, I think some of the other
01:01:23 supernovas are kind of old.
01:01:25 Like Uruj, he's kind of, you know,
01:01:27 30s. Yeah, like, like
01:01:29 what's, what's the gang beach
01:01:31 is like. Capone gay. Oh, that's true.
01:01:33 Capone gang is pretty old. I think Drake
01:01:35 is probably in his 30s or something, whatever.
01:01:37 Yeah. Um, yeah.
01:01:39 Like it doesn't matter what age
01:01:41 you are really. Yeah. Like their age doesn't
01:01:43 matter. It's the fact that they became relevant
01:01:45 at that time.
01:01:47 And like, you know, like, we're saying before, with like Harrison
01:01:49 Ford and, and the guy from
01:01:51 Die Hard, Alan Rickman.
01:01:53 Bruce Willis. Oh, no, yeah.
01:01:55 No, and Alan Rickman. But he started kind of late, too.
01:01:57 But whatever. He did, yeah.
01:01:59 You can, you can,
01:02:01 it's never too late
01:02:03 and people can become relevant
01:02:05 at any stage of life. It happens,
01:02:07 you know. Like sometimes
01:02:09 you might think, you might think
01:02:11 that just because you're not where you want to be,
01:02:13 you know, creatively
01:02:15 financially or you know relationship wise or in any aspect of life you might
01:02:19 think you're not where you want to be at whatever age you're at but like you know
01:02:23 I'd say it's pretty safe no matter what age you are it's pretty safe bet that
01:02:27 someone has succeeded later then yeah say once you pass age a hundred you can
01:02:33 probably say well then you can get some yeah then you can give up but at least
01:02:38 you're gonna agree news and you're gonna get a letter from the Queen and it's
01:02:42 gonna be interesting do you get a letter from the Queen when you turn a hundred
01:02:44 yeah whoa you got right why doesn't Obama send send me a letter from the
01:02:50 queen yeah yeah I know I don't want Obama I want Obama to just ask the
01:02:58 Queen for one yeah that'd be nice yeah all right I think we've wrapped it up in
01:03:04 a nice little Queenly bow here but do we have any does that do we have anything
01:03:09 else to say on the subject of being an old-ass bitch I think I said my piece I
01:03:14 don't think I'm gonna be old like and I don't think I'm gonna consider myself
01:03:19 old until I'm 60 until then I'm just a guy yeah I mean you know you could start
01:03:25 I'd start worrying about it at like 50 then you can start to think about it but
01:03:29 don't really worry about to your 70 70 is the bridge to real you know you can
01:03:35 worry about shit that that older mangaka who was getting slow and who was
01:03:39 like past his prime he was like 78 whereas like these guys in like their
01:03:42 50s and even like this other lady who was 60 something they were still chugging
01:03:46 away yeah they're fine exact doing exactly what they wanted to do with their
01:03:50 life and like you're doing what you want to do you're you're as young as you
01:03:53 need to be mm-hmm there's one thing from the movie up that sort of struck a cord
01:03:58 with me is that the the kid watching that guy the pilot guy or the explorer
01:04:04 the explorer guy was like in his 20s or something and the kid you know I forget
01:04:09 his name oh yeah and then it cut at the beginning forward yeah and he's like
01:04:14 he's 60 or something and the guy the explorer is still out there he's like
01:04:18 he's in his 80s yeah but they're both considered old but like that's like a
01:04:24 20 year difference that's a lot of years yeah the guy still be doing things yeah
01:04:28 the guys like still I mean you there's plenty of time to be old you know like
01:04:36 you can be you can be you can be kind of old for a long-ass time and get a lot
01:04:41 done in that time you know it's very true it's very true so everybody thanks
