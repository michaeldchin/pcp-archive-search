00:00:00 I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:13 Okay, I'm recording.
00:00:15 I am also, also what?
00:00:24 I am also recording why?
00:00:26 Context clues.
00:00:28 Uh, yeah.
00:00:30 Context what?
00:00:32 Clues.
00:00:33 What?
00:00:34 What?
00:00:35 What?
00:00:36 What?
00:00:37 What do you mean what?
00:00:39 What?
00:00:40 Huh?
00:00:41 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:42 Oh, we gotta sync.
00:00:43 Okay.
00:00:44 No, that was a good start.
00:00:45 No.
00:00:46 Let's leave it in.
00:00:47 No.
00:00:48 Okay.
00:00:49 On the count of three, say sync.
00:00:50 One, two, three.
00:00:51 Sync.
00:00:52 Sync.
00:00:53 Eleazar, leave that intro in, it's good.
00:01:02 Uh, yeah, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:01:08 I'm weary, I guess, exhausted because I've been moving furniture and cleaning stuff
00:01:17 all day.
00:01:18 Oh, why is that?
00:01:21 It's like a spring clean, moving stuff around.
00:01:25 Hmm, yeah, okay, fair.
00:01:28 It's nice every so often to be like, okay, well, furniture has been here for so long.
00:01:35 Why don't we just put it somewhere else in the room?
00:01:38 Oh, yeah.
00:01:39 It'll change the feeling of it.
00:01:43 Did I tell you, when I, this was several years ago, I lived with a guy, coincidental
00:01:51 only named Conrad, no relation, who was, uh, uh, what's the word?
00:01:59 He was, oh, no, was it OCD?
00:02:01 No, it was bipolar.
00:02:02 He was bipolar and he would have moods and when he would get manic, there was one time
00:02:07 in particular that I caught it.
00:02:10 I didn't really realize this was going on at the time, but he was, he was in a manic episode
00:02:14 and he was, uh, he insisted to me, like we have to move the furniture around, like we
00:02:19 have to move the furniture around, like right now, like we have to move the couch from one
00:02:24 side of the room to the other side of the room and like we have to move this chair
00:02:28 up the stairs.
00:02:29 You've got to help me move this chair up the stairs and like we have to move these shelves
00:02:32 to the other side of the room.
00:02:33 We have to, we have to just reverse everything and then like mostly kind of put it back where
00:02:37 it started and ever since I don't, I don't think people with mental illnesses should
00:02:46 have, should have equal rights.
00:02:48 Oh, I thought you were going to say I don't think people with mental illnesses should
00:02:52 own furniture because then they wouldn't be able to move it.
00:02:58 Well, yeah, that's, that's, that's one of the rights I think should be.
00:03:01 You'll sleep on the floor and here's this nice straight jacket, padded, so classic.
00:03:13 Here's a, here's a, here's a, here's a single pizza oven for you to cook the rest of your
00:03:21 meals for all eternity.
00:03:23 That's pretty good.
00:03:25 You can make pizza.
00:03:26 Yeah.
00:03:27 Yeah.
00:03:28 Yeah.
00:03:29 Yeah.
00:03:30 Yeah.
00:03:31 We don't give them much, but we give them a rustic, a rustic wood-fired pizza oven and
00:03:34 a pizza pillow and all the fresh vine ripe, fresh Jersey tomatoes.
00:03:39 Oh, like I talked about, I thought I was making a PCP.
00:03:44 Reference, but no, that was, I talked about, I talked about Jersey fresh tomatoes on my
00:03:50 main character syndrome podcast on Cheezy's channel with YOLO swag.
00:03:56 Oh, yes.
00:03:57 I hadn't got around to listening to that.
00:04:00 It was pretty funny.
00:04:01 We talked about fucking the subject of, the subject of pizza sauces came up and I referenced
00:04:09 what's that one, what's that one that comes in the can?
00:04:14 Papa, no, Don, Don Pepito, Don Pepitos, Don Pepitos sauce made with fresh Jersey tomatoes.
00:04:27 Whenever, whenever you like, I don't know, whenever I have like Googled around for like
00:04:32 authentic pizza sauces, Don Pepitos is always one of the, one of the first ones that pops
00:04:38 up.
00:04:39 Pepito.
00:04:40 It was, I opined there like, wait a minute, isn't it Pepito, a pumpkin seed?
00:04:49 I guess it's Spanish and they're not the same language, but I don't know, is he, is he Don
00:04:56 Pumpkin seed?
00:04:58 We'll never know.
00:05:00 There's no way to find out or verify this.
00:05:04 You know what?
00:05:05 I'm going to do it right now.
00:05:07 Translate.
00:05:08 Here we go.
00:05:09 Here we go.
00:05:10 Uh, enter text.
00:05:11 Uh, all right.
00:05:12 Spanish.
00:05:13 Right.
00:05:14 Here we go.
00:05:15 We're going to find out.
00:05:16 Why is a Spaniard got a pizza place or a sauce?
00:05:19 Spitalian.
00:05:20 Oh wait.
00:05:21 I'm, I'm sorry.
00:05:22 I'm sorry.
00:05:25 When I try, when I attempt to translate Pepito, which I have certainly seen pumpkin seeds
00:05:32 called, the translation it gives me is nugget.
00:05:36 So I'm a little, I'm a little bit taken aback here.
00:05:39 Pumpkin nuggets.
00:05:40 They're, that's not, they're, no, no, under no, uh, no, under no frame of reference.
00:05:49 Here we go.
00:05:50 Here we go.
00:05:51 In Italian, uh, Pepito is nothing, Pepita is also nugget.
00:05:59 Okay.
00:06:00 Whatever.
00:06:01 Great.
00:06:02 So he's pop, he's Don Nugget, maybe I don't, I don't, I don't trust, uh, I don't, I don't
00:06:09 really trust Google translate to, I'm missing some context here.
00:06:14 It's fine.
00:06:15 I've learned nothing, but you know what I didn't learn nothing doing, going, wait, no,
00:06:25 yes, I did.
00:06:26 Going to the library.
00:06:27 I finally went to the library.
00:06:28 Oh my God.
00:06:29 I've been threatening to go to the library for months and I finally did it yesterday.
00:06:36 What did you read?
00:06:37 Yeah.
00:06:38 Well, I was looking, I looked for, I looked for some Foucault because I want to read Foucault
00:06:44 and they didn't have any.
00:06:46 So I put some on hold and I reserved some from another library and they're going to send
00:06:51 that.
00:06:52 I'm not sure when it'll be there soon, probably.
00:06:55 In the meantime, I checked out, I checked out two like, uh, sort of like career advice
00:07:01 books just to like, maybe I'd learned something useful from these and, uh, I've read like
00:07:07 30 pages of one and I don't, I don't think the advice in there is for me.
00:07:10 I don't think it's really what I was hoping it was.
00:07:13 Step one, go to business school.
00:07:15 Step two, write a self-help book.
00:07:18 Heh.
00:07:19 Heh.
00:07:20 I mean, yeah.
00:07:21 Uh, no.
00:07:24 This, I, hold on.
00:07:26 This was called, let me find it.
00:07:29 Yeah, I started reading one that I just grabbed randomly off the shelf.
00:07:33 It's called What You're Really Meant To Do by Robert Steven Kaplan and, uh, I feel really,
00:07:39 I read like the intro and started the second chapter and it seems like this is for someone
00:07:45 who has been like working a job that like a nine to five that is starting to bore them
00:07:52 or they've decided that they're not that good at and they want to like switch careers.
00:07:55 They were like, oh, I actually always wanted to be a concert pianist.
00:07:59 Oh, but my wife and kids won't understand if I stop being a jewelry salesman.
00:08:05 You know?
00:08:06 Yeah.
00:08:07 Uh, it's like, well, I don't know, it's exactly what it is.
00:08:11 It implies that you have the capabilities to, to save up using your current job you already
00:08:17 have in order to, to make a big splash on a new scene.
00:08:22 Um, right?
00:08:24 Well, that's what I feel like a lot of these things are, that they assume you have more
00:08:28 means than you actually do.
00:08:31 That's not really what I, that's not really what I'm getting at.
00:08:34 What I'm getting at is that this is for someone who's like in a job they don't like and like,
00:08:39 I want to pursue my, my real dream.
00:08:41 What's my real dream?
00:08:42 And I guess I, I guess I'm already doing that.
00:08:44 Like I guess I already don't have a nine to five.
00:08:47 I already sustained myself, such as I do, uh, you know, doing art or whatever.
00:08:55 And you know, my advice is not how do I quit my job and follow my dream?
00:08:59 I guess I already did that.
00:09:00 How do you follow through, well, maybe the later chapters are like, how to, once you
00:09:04 got your dream, what do you do now?
00:09:08 Yeah.
00:09:09 You die, probably.
00:09:11 Uh, yeah, you just, um, you just wait to die.
00:09:16 You just burn through all of your shit.
00:09:20 There's no more mountains to climb.
00:09:23 Um, I was thinking about it.
00:09:28 I don't know.
00:09:29 I just, I just liked, I just liked, uh, working on, I just liked making cool stuff in like
00:09:37 a team.
00:09:39 I think, I think that's what I liked.
00:09:42 Uh, I liked being a part of something.
00:09:44 And, uh, I think the most fun I ever had working was, uh, making T-Bap with Nate back in the
00:09:52 day.
00:09:53 Uh, and, uh, I don't know, I guess I would, I guess I would like to do something that
00:10:01 feels like that used to feel, you know, uh, I don't, I mean, making, for instance, making
00:10:09 Phantom's Revenge was good and all.
00:10:11 I mean, it was a good, uh, it was a good thing to do.
00:10:15 It was, uh, it was fun to work on in its own way, but it didn't have that, uh, didn't
00:10:21 have that feeling of like I'm part of something, you know, because I was all by myself.
00:10:27 I was all by myself making it for, basically just making it for, for me, uh, and it was
00:10:36 different, you know, you know, so I think that's part of what I'm like.
00:10:41 I think that's part of what I'm feeling now, like something's missing.
00:10:47 And it's that.
00:10:48 What if you try doing art for someone else's comic?
00:10:54 What if, what if I write a comic and then you draw it?
00:10:58 I mean, uh, that's not, I'm not saying that wouldn't work, but it's not.
00:11:09 Yeah.
00:11:10 Well, when you think about like being part of something is like, does, do you need to
00:11:14 be emotionally disattached from it or like super engaged with it?
00:11:19 And also someone else happens to be the same engagement.
00:11:24 Like with tea back, I'm sure like who, who you got Nate to watch my little pony, right?
00:11:32 I think so.
00:11:32 I started, yeah, I think I, I, I roped him into checking it out first.
00:11:38 Yeah.
00:11:39 And then when did you decide to make a show?
00:11:42 How did that happen?
00:11:44 Maybe, maybe a couple months after.
00:11:47 Well, like, like, I think I've told the story.
00:11:49 The idea, the thing was we would always watch the new episode and then we would
00:11:53 always be like, lol, what'd you think of that new episode?
00:11:56 It sucks, uh, it stinks.
00:12:00 Um, and then we were like, Hey, you know, we always like have these conversations
00:12:04 about the new episode.
00:12:06 Why don't we record them and make and put them on the internet?
00:12:11 And that's what we did.
00:12:12 Um, like who was, whose idea was that?
00:12:15 Do you remember to like make videos?
00:12:18 I believe it was mine.
00:12:19 I believe it was me who was like, we should record these.
00:12:24 I think so.
00:12:25 You know, you know what though?
00:12:26 I should, it's, it's two things.
00:12:27 There's two, there's two distinct elements here that should be split from each other.
00:12:33 There's the, there's the jolly cooperation and like being a part of a team thing.
00:12:39 I did like, when we were all of it, when we were all single-minded of purpose,
00:12:43 that's good.
00:12:44 And I, and I do like it.
00:12:45 But the other aspect is, is that it was part of like a scene.
00:12:48 It was part of a scene and there was like a community and people and there was like a,
00:12:54 you know, phantoms revenge is not part of a scene.
00:12:57 Right.
00:12:57 Uh, uh, or at least not a scene, despite getting on equestria daily.
00:13:02 And I guess despite being like CWC relevant, I don't even know if you could call
00:13:08 that a scene.
00:13:08 And even if it is a scene, it's a scene that I despise.
00:13:11 So, so there's no real scene there.
00:13:15 I liked that it was part of a, uh, uh, part of a scene, part of a community,
00:13:19 part of a conversation.
00:13:22 Um, and that lately, it just feels like I'm just talking to myself.
00:13:29 You know?
00:13:31 Yeah.
00:13:32 I'm going, I'm going crazy.
00:13:34 The pony thing was like a good rallying point, I guess.
00:13:41 Yeah.
00:13:42 I think a lot of my, my like creative drive is like, I feel inadequate.
00:13:48 And so I need to prove to myself that I can do things that I want to do.
00:13:53 Be like, I'm not that good at drawing.
00:13:56 Ah, I gotta make drawings then.
00:13:59 Hmm.
00:14:00 Yeah.
00:14:01 Sure.
00:14:03 That's funny.
00:14:03 It's, it's not like, I don't, it's, I don't have that particular hangup.
00:14:08 My hangups are different.
00:14:10 It's like, uh, not that that's like the sole reason for making anything.
00:14:14 I have like creative drive, uh, in general, just like, oh, I want to do that.
00:14:19 Everything I do is solely motivated by proving that I am not bad at the
00:14:27 specific thing I'm doing.
00:14:29 Yeah.
00:14:29 But like, I brush my teeth in the morning.
00:14:31 I, oh, they said I couldn't brush these teeth.
00:14:34 They said I couldn't do it just because I'm British.
00:14:38 Yeah.
00:14:40 Uh, I showed them.
00:14:42 Um, but like, I don't feel that like isolation as like a drawback, like, oh, I
00:14:50 make something, I guess it is a bit like upsetting sometimes when you make
00:14:54 something, it's like, ah, that was good.
00:14:56 And then nobody, nobody likes it.
00:15:00 Like physically, like, I'm sure people enjoy it, but they don't like click the
00:15:03 like button and like, dang.
00:15:05 Yeah.
00:15:06 And that's what it's, and that's at the end of the day, that's what it's all
00:15:08 about.
00:15:08 It's all about that feedback.
00:15:09 It's all about that engagement.
00:15:12 You know, it's all about that algorithm.
00:15:14 I mean, I know it's, well, I mean, the algorithm is whatever.
00:15:16 It's just sort of like, if you don't get feedback of any kind that people are even
00:15:22 paying attention, then it does feel like you're literally throwing things into
00:15:25 avoid.
00:15:27 It's like, why did I upload this?
00:15:28 Why did I make it?
00:15:30 Do I like it?
00:15:31 And then you look at it and you're like, do I like, I don't know.
00:15:35 Maybe it sucks.
00:15:36 Maybe that means I sucks.
00:15:39 I passed, uh, I passed 300 downloads on phantom's revenge, which is a number
00:15:45 that I feel mixed about.
00:15:47 I feel like, you know, in one sense, it's kind of a good number.
00:15:52 Like, like someone downloading the game and hopefully playing it is higher
00:15:56 commitment.
00:15:57 Like that's worth more than someone watching a YouTube video or liking a
00:16:01 tweet or something, but also just, just not enough.
00:16:05 It's just not enough people.
00:16:07 And, uh, I, uh, I don't know.
00:16:10 I need that I'm a little, I'm a little, uh, I don't know.
00:16:14 I'm frustrated because I know I need to, like I anticipated that I would need to
00:16:19 do more after it was done to get it seen.
00:16:22 Uh, I need to make a trailer.
00:16:24 I don't want to make a trailer, but I have to make a trailer.
00:16:27 Um, um, mostly I have to do the Kickstarter.
00:16:31 I have to do the slime and punishment Kickstarter.
00:16:33 And I feel like just that alone is going to get some eyes on the game that
00:16:36 wouldn't have seen it before.
00:16:38 Cause Kickstarter, for some reason, Kickstarter is always like generate.
00:16:42 There's always sort of like generate hype in and of themselves.
00:16:46 It's pretty cool, I guess.
00:16:48 So I don't know.
00:16:48 Like that's, that's a big, that's an instrumental part of the whole thing.
00:16:53 I won't, I don't feel like I can look back on the, on the launch of phantom's
00:16:59 revenge and call it like, you know, a failure until that's over.
00:17:05 And then I can, and then I can truly look back and be like, so how did it actually
00:17:09 do?
00:17:09 What did people actually say about it?
00:17:12 Um, yeah.
00:17:16 So I don't, it's just a lot to do.
00:17:18 It's just a lot to do.
00:17:19 And it just continues to feel like I'm just talking to myself and going insane
00:17:23 and losing my mind.
00:17:26 And for what?
00:17:27 Yeah, nothing.
00:17:29 I can't think of like what, like a solution to that, that feeling.
00:17:34 It's like, oh, just, just have it be different.
00:17:36 Like, I don't know how does that work?
00:17:39 I know, I know, I know, I know, all you got to do is take a cup of flour, add it
00:17:48 to the mix.
00:17:52 Sometimes I have mused, sometimes I have mused about like, uh, getting a job at
00:17:57 like a, getting a job at like a small game studio or something.
00:18:02 That would be my, that would be my, my, probably be my dream job.
00:18:07 As long as I like liked my coworkers, I would just want to be, that would be my
00:18:12 dream job as long as like, I, Mike, I thought my coworkers were cool.
00:18:18 And I respected them and they were all, and I considered us all to be, uh, uh,
00:18:24 instrumental parts of a, of a team.
00:18:27 That would be very exciting, I think.
00:18:30 But it's so, cause like, what if I, what if I tried, what a nightmare scenario?
00:18:34 What if I tried to do that and I do it and I get a job at a studio and I, and I
00:18:39 feel like just a cog in a machine.
00:18:42 It would literally just be worse than not, than nothing.
00:18:46 It would just be a trap.
00:18:47 Hmm.
00:18:49 Yeah.
00:18:49 Life is very stupid.
00:18:53 Yeah.
00:18:55 Dude, you hear about the pumpkin alley, pumpkin patch?
00:18:58 Yeah, I didn't play it, but I saw the announcement.
00:19:02 Uh, Sixten actually found all the lizards.
00:19:06 No shit.
00:19:07 No shit.
00:19:08 How many lizards are there total?
00:19:10 Uh, there's eight.
00:19:12 Wow.
00:19:12 Okay.
00:19:14 Fuff.
00:19:15 Fuff.
00:19:16 Fluff.
00:19:16 What color?
00:19:17 Woof.
00:19:18 What colors are they?
00:19:19 Um, all the colors of the rainbow.
00:19:24 There's, there's only seven colors in the rainbow.
00:19:27 You, Nini?
00:19:29 Uh, well, um, the, the, to the rainbow.
00:19:33 The turquoise is a color.
00:19:34 Shut up.
00:19:36 Uh, there's an infrared one.
00:19:41 He's invisible.
00:19:42 There's a, there's a chroma key one and not a chroma key.
00:19:44 Uh, what do you call it?
00:19:47 Like the, the, the alpha channel is an alpha channel colored one.
00:19:53 It's invisible.
00:19:54 Oh, oh, I see.
00:19:55 I see.
00:19:56 There's a, um, well, there's, well, there, there, the, the colors of the, there
00:20:02 are the colors of the more inclusive, uh, LGBT flag.
00:20:07 They had, you got the six colors and then you got brown and black for, for people
00:20:11 of color, I don't know.
00:20:15 Uh, you got one, you got this, you got the seven colors of the rainbow.
00:20:18 And then you got, um, and then you got brown.
00:20:21 Oh, the black, but there was a, no, there's not a black one.
00:20:24 There's a white one.
00:20:26 I guess if there's all the colors, the seven colors plus white would be kind of,
00:20:29 I know there is a white one.
00:20:31 I saw Keyblade Spirit find it on her stream and I was like, whoa, a white one.
00:20:37 Ah, I want to give this one like a better test score on it.
00:20:41 Standardized tests and like, give it a job.
00:20:45 I want, I want to make this one my executive vice president.
00:20:51 Hmm.
00:20:51 I relate, I relate to this one.
00:20:54 I want to see this one in my superhero movies.
00:21:00 Is there a lizard based superhero?
00:21:02 Wait, wait, uh, uh, you, you have no right to judge him just because he was white.
00:21:08 Wow.
00:21:08 Uh, you, Kimba, your fur is white because you come from a long line of great leaders.
00:21:13 Wow.
00:21:14 I hope I can be like my ancestors as well as look like them.
00:21:17 Yes, Kimba.
00:21:21 Wow.
00:21:23 Wow.
00:21:24 You're just a white pussy cat.
00:21:26 I look, do you know that?
00:21:27 You've seen that YMS Kimba video, right?
00:21:29 Yes.
00:21:30 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:21:31 That does.
00:21:32 He's the whole subplot about who's persecuted for being white.
00:21:36 I mean, it makes, it makes sense for an animal, but it's still just really funny.
00:21:39 Yeah, especially since it's in Africa.
00:21:42 You're right, right.
00:21:44 Africa, the whitest land.
00:21:46 Persecuted for being white.
00:21:49 So this is what happened, this is what happened, this is what happened to Davoo.
00:21:52 When Davoo went to, was it South Africa to be, it was somewhere in Africa to be a missionary
00:21:58 and she, and the only white people she had around for comfort was Mario and Luigi.
00:22:05 Wait, what?
00:22:06 I remember that.
00:22:07 Do you remember, she said, she went to Africa for that, but like her parents did like missionary
00:22:15 work in Africa and she said, I don't know, I don't want to blow it out of proportion,
00:22:21 but she, she definitely commented for once or twice that there were no other white people
00:22:26 and she, and she occasionally found it comforting when she would play, I think it was Mario,
00:22:33 Superstar Saga, I think, on the GBA and she'd be like, oh, look, I relate to these, my fellow
00:22:38 white people.
00:22:39 Well, I mean, I forget how young she was then.
00:22:44 Even though Italians aren't white, but I mean, you take what you can get, you know,
00:22:49 when you're in the, when you're in the heart of darkness, so to speak.
00:22:53 When you really strip it back, is there like, like white is not actually a thing, it's just
00:23:00 a color of skin.
00:23:03 Do people mean like a specific thing and then like, oh, well, these Europeans are not technically
00:23:09 white.
00:23:10 What do people mean when they say that?
00:23:12 Yeah.
00:23:13 Well, I mean, it's very.
00:23:14 It's always arbitrary.
00:23:15 It's Italians and Irish used to not be considered white.
00:23:19 Yeah.
00:23:20 Jews are sometimes, some people don't consider them white and it's all, it's all arbitrary.
00:23:26 Yeah.
00:23:27 You could, you could just be like, well, it depends on the, on the tone of your skin.
00:23:30 But I mean, you know, some Asian people have the same color skin.
00:23:34 It's like, are some Asian people just white because they're paler?
00:23:38 I don't know.
00:23:39 I don't think so.
00:23:40 Very few, very few people would say that.
00:23:42 Yeah.
00:23:43 At the end of the day, it is all just kind of, it's all kind of made up.
00:23:49 That's why I think transracialism is good and based.
00:23:54 I actually kind of do though.
00:23:55 I actually, I actually kind of was thinking about, and like, I really do think that like
00:24:00 race really is just as socially constructed and there, there really is no reason why,
00:24:05 like if someone said like, I actually consider myself to be, you know, white, like what am
00:24:12 I going to, what am I going to, and you know, they're black or whatever, I, what am I going
00:24:15 to stand there and be like, well, here's why you're wrong, sir, here's why I disagree.
00:24:20 Here's why you can't do that.
00:24:21 I would never do that.
00:24:24 I think it's weird, no, you know what, I think it's weird, not weird, but like, it doesn't
00:24:30 work like from, to say like, oh, I identify as white because it's, it's not a specific
00:24:38 nation.
00:24:39 Like, there's like, it's vague enough that that's like, not as weird, but like, if you
00:24:44 say I identify as black, there's a lot of like cultural significance tied to the skin
00:24:53 color, at least in the Western world, white, white just means it's the color of your skin.
00:24:59 And it doesn't just mean that.
00:25:01 No, but like, if I said I identify as Italian or something, I feel like, I feel like people
00:25:09 would be like, well, no, we're not from Italy, it's like, yeah, yeah, I mean, nationality
00:25:16 is a little, I mean, it's honestly, honestly, I feel like you could probably construct a
00:25:22 similar, I kind of think if someone was like, I identify as Italian, I'd be like, well,
00:25:27 who am I to say you're not, I guess, I mean, I guess to be like, well, have you ever been
00:25:31 to Italy?
00:25:32 Like, do you know any Italians, you ever, you ever eat a pizza?
00:25:37 I understand this, like it's arbitrary, but like, I feel like it would be weird.
00:25:43 And like, I wouldn't expect anyone to respect that, yeah, like race or nationality, I mean,
00:25:54 if you go in there and live there, well, here's, then I think it's different, but like, when
00:25:59 it comes to like black and white, people look different.
00:26:03 Yeah.
00:26:05 Uh, I think we should, I think we should stop, I think we should stop respecting racial distinctions
00:26:13 more, I think we should respect them less.
00:26:16 I think we should, we should acknowledge that they are socially constructed, and therefore
00:26:22 subject to an individual simply deciding that they don't believe in them, or don't agree
00:26:29 about how they're defined.
00:26:31 And I think we don't, I think we, I think we have to, I think we have to accept that.
00:26:38 I think it's true.
00:26:39 Okay.
00:26:40 I mean, I guess, like logically, it's fine.
00:26:45 I'm thinking of like, I'm thinking of like practicality, though, like, when it comes
00:26:51 to like trans, the boundaries between men and women are arbitrary, and like this, you
00:27:00 know, but there's also a lot of people who are socially constructed.
00:27:04 It's socially constructed, but there are a lot of people who are trans, so it makes
00:27:07 sense then to respect like trans identities, because does it only make sense because there
00:27:15 are a lot of them?
00:27:16 I think there's an argument where like, I mean, hypothetically, I say there's exactly
00:27:23 one person in the world who is trans-racial, and they feel that way.
00:27:30 I don't want to be like status quo.
00:27:32 You got to kill them.
00:27:33 No.
00:27:34 You just got to kill them.
00:27:36 I think it's just sort of, status quo, status quo, status quo.
00:27:41 I've never thought of like, arguing this for this thing, because it's like, it's odd,
00:27:46 because you don't hear about trans-racialists, like really existing.
00:27:51 You don't.
00:27:52 You hear about that one lady.
00:27:53 That one lady, and I guess, practically, like, logically, logically, sound.
00:28:03 It's true.
00:28:05 Nobody does it.
00:28:06 Nobody seems to want to be like, I actually just feel like a white person on the inside.
00:28:12 Well, I mean, that's not true.
00:28:17 What I mean is, it's so weird and unusual that it's like, kind of not worth currently,
00:28:24 at least.
00:28:25 Not worth worrying about.
00:28:26 Trying to implement that into society, because the benefit it would give is like so minor.
00:28:33 If there were lots of people, like a significant portion of any population that sincerely feels
00:28:41 trans-racial, then we should actually think more about it and try to shift societies to
00:28:48 make it more acceptable in practical terms.
00:28:53 I guess at the end of the day, a society that recognizes trans-racial identities doesn't
00:29:01 really look any different on paper.
00:29:04 Because on paper, at least, nobody in general in modern countries, mostly, are specifically
00:29:14 denied any rights for being one race or another.
00:29:21 We don't have, shit, what were those laws called, like post-slavery segregation laws?
00:29:29 Jim Crow?
00:29:30 We don't have Jim Crow laws, we don't have the remnants of them.
00:29:36 You can't use the right, that bathroom, you got to use the other water fountain or whatever.
00:29:40 There exists remnants from those laws in current legislation, which is that.
00:29:47 And there's obviously racism in the general populace, but the thing that they're racist
00:29:56 about is simply the look of the person, not necessarily what it says on their legal definition
00:30:02 of what race they are.
00:30:03 If you could get your race changed on legal documents, people would still profile you
00:30:07 for being one skin color or another or look in a certain way.
00:30:12 So it's not as simple as just saying, alright, this is the way it is, you have to respect
00:30:19 it, because not that you've got to capitulate to the people who hate change, but if there's
00:30:29 one person, it's different from if there's lots of people for societal change to be actually
00:30:40 important.
00:30:43 I mean, I'm not proposing any societal change, because like I said, on paper, there's not
00:30:52 a lot of explicit rules about what black people can do anymore.
00:31:00 So it's not like suddenly they're like, oh, well, just because this person identifies
00:31:08 as white doesn't mean they should be.
00:31:13 Imagine Twitter in the day, Twitter in the Jim Crow days, ridiculous, this person just
00:31:18 because we're just going to accept that this person says that they identify as a white
00:31:21 person and just because of that, they're allowed to drink from the water fountain, making everybody
00:31:27 feel unsafe.
00:31:28 We have to crack down on this transracialism.
00:31:33 The current racism in the institutions is more implied than explicit.
00:31:42 So there's nothing that would necessarily change to the institution if transracialism
00:31:47 was legally recognized and whatever.
00:31:53 They'd just shift it to be like, oh, well, you may be white, but you are still of a certain
00:31:57 culture which I don't agree with, and it's like, okay, you're still being racist.
00:32:02 I mean, that's already what they do.
00:32:06 They say, oh, it's not about brown people immigrating, and it's about people from a
00:32:15 different culture.
00:32:17 It's about cultural differences.
00:32:19 They're destroying our culture by cannibalizing.
00:32:22 They come over here and they have different food, and I don't like it.
00:32:26 Western values, Western values, they bring Allah, and he's-
00:32:33 Allah, these nuts.
00:32:34 They should say that when they cross the border.
00:32:43 If any refugees from Syria still coming in, any Muslims-
00:32:47 They should say that.
00:32:48 Why don't they say that?
00:32:49 Why don't they say that?
00:32:50 Why don't they say that?
00:32:51 Why don't they say that?
00:32:52 I don't know.
00:32:53 They would be so much more accepted if only they said Allah, these nuts.
00:32:57 I think so.
00:32:58 And then everyone would go, ah, you got us.
00:33:02 That's what I would say.
00:33:05 It is all of those nuts, I would say, slapping my knee.
00:33:10 Okay.
00:33:11 Shit.
00:33:12 Do I have anything else to say about that?
00:33:16 How do we get on this topic?
00:33:19 How did I-
00:33:20 I was talking about my career books, and then-
00:33:31 And so all of a sudden, Allah, these nuts.
00:33:33 I genuinely don't remember how we started talking about this.
00:33:38 It's that COVID brain fog.
00:33:39 That's not true.
00:33:41 I've always been like this, but I had a horrifying thought.
00:33:48 Let me just continue.
00:33:50 Oh, I said I went to the library.
00:33:51 Yeah.
00:33:53 And then, I don't know, whatever, point is I'm waiting for Foucault.
00:33:56 I'm waiting for Foucault to- it's like waiting for a good dough.
00:34:00 Foucault, the Japanese sexual lingerie model.
00:34:07 My favorite.
00:34:08 The one that- I think we talked about that on the booby bonus episode.
00:34:12 The booby bonus.
00:34:13 The booby bonus.
00:34:14 What do we call that one?
00:34:15 Oh, it was just ass versus nothing.
00:34:17 Oh, no, boobs versus nothing, tits versus nothing.
00:34:22 Yeah.
00:34:23 No.
00:34:26 Funny you should- I didn't even- yeah.
00:34:28 Pronounce the same.
00:34:30 Foucault, well, emphasis is on the- oh, but no, F-F-O-U-C-A-U-L-T.
00:34:37 Just a bunch of people who I watch on- a bunch of YouTubers that I like have all referenced
00:34:42 his work.
00:34:43 It's like, well, maybe I should read some of it.
00:34:46 So I was going to read some.
00:34:47 Instead, I got this fucking career book, which is like- this is not- I don't even-
00:34:52 It's a fucking career, North Korea, South Korea, I don't get it.
00:34:57 Very nice.
00:34:58 And it- whatever, no need to- whatever, I don't remember how we did it, but it's okay.
00:35:03 Back on the subject of- oh, the game.
00:35:06 I had a horrifying thought, I had a horrifying thought, and it is that- see, like, I know
00:35:12 and I always knew.
00:35:14 I always knew that it was, like, toxic, that it was Sonichu related.
00:35:20 Like, I know that that's bad, and I've always known that that's bad, and I know that- how
00:35:27 it looks, right?
00:35:29 I know how it looks when you say, oh, I made a video game.
00:35:34 What's it about?
00:35:35 Oh, it's about Sonichu's.
00:35:36 Right?
00:35:37 It's specifically about murdering Sonichu's, so maybe it's, like, anti-Toxic.
00:35:41 Yeah.
00:35:42 Well, here's the- here's where my thoughts.
00:35:46 On the one hand, I was like, what if- what if the Sonichu connection is so toxic that
00:35:52 if I want this game to, like, ever be seen by any kind of audience at all, like, the-
00:35:57 the smartest thing- the most efficient way to do that is just to base- not fully remake
00:36:03 it, but basically just rebrand it and release it as a new game with, like, a different story
00:36:07 and, like, different assets and no Sonichu's.
00:36:09 And maybe no My Little Pony either.
00:36:12 Just call it- just call it something else.
00:36:16 And, like, I guess I-
00:36:17 I mean, it's, like, not even that difficult, aside from all the assets you need to draw.
00:36:23 Drawing the assets is not that bad, depending on how, like- depending on how much I had
00:36:31 to remake some of the cutscenes or the dialogue would have to be re-considered, which could
00:36:37 take a while, I mean.
00:36:40 I mean, here's- I mean, if I knew- if I knew- if God came down and told me, Ben, if you
00:36:45 just took the Sonichu's out, this game would see, you know, 10,000 people would download
00:36:51 it on Twitch.
00:36:52 Or on- on- on itch, rather.
00:36:54 I'd be like, okay, well, I guess I'll do that.
00:36:57 Uh, but I don't know if that's the case, and I don't know if it would be a waste of effort
00:37:02 to do it.
00:37:03 I would do it if it- if it would help.
00:37:05 And I- I put it- man, I don't know, maybe it wouldn't.
00:37:09 So I guess there's two thoughts that I had, and one was maybe, what if the thing to do
00:37:14 is just to undo all that?
00:37:16 No, I wouldn't- like, I would leave Phantom's Revenge up, and I would just release, like,
00:37:20 a- a different version, is- in- in this timeline.
00:37:23 The- the socially acceptable Phantom's Revenge, but not Phantom.
00:37:27 Yeah.
00:37:28 I would just- I don't know, I would just theme it, you know, just a little more, like, its
00:37:33 own thing.
00:37:34 I- I would- would have to think of what that would look like.
00:37:36 I don't- I have no idea.
00:37:38 Um, what if it was keg standard?
00:37:44 Yeah.
00:37:45 Mm-hmm.
00:37:46 Yeah.
00:37:47 He's- he's much more marketable.
00:37:48 Yeah.
00:37:49 Um, I mean, what- if it- not a pony, then what character would it be?
00:37:56 Would you have to-
00:37:57 I genuinely have no idea.
00:37:58 Like, design a new thing?
00:37:59 Could it be a Beastars game?
00:38:01 Beastars?
00:38:02 No, uh, not Beastars, uh, Biscopades.
00:38:06 I mean, I don't think so.
00:38:08 I don't know how- I don't know what that would look like.
00:38:10 Well, you got your little guy with his helmet and he's got a weapon or something.
00:38:15 Does he have a weapon?
00:38:17 I forget.
00:38:18 I feel like he did.
00:38:19 No, he does.
00:38:20 A Beast Knight has a weapon.
00:38:22 Oh, he's- wait, does Beast- does Beast Hustler have a katana?
00:38:26 I- I think?
00:38:27 I thought he did.
00:38:28 I think- I think he- I forgot, yeah, he totally does.
00:38:32 He has a sword that he picks up off his- I totally forgot.
00:38:35 Beast has a weapon.
00:38:37 You could have little beasts come and they'd be like, eh, eh, eh.
00:38:40 I should reread Biscopades and get myself caught up on it so that I can, like, continue
00:38:45 it.
00:38:46 Yeah.
00:38:47 I need- I need to, like, remember what's actually in it before I keep it going.
00:38:50 But that's not- that's not what I want to talk about right now.
00:38:52 What I- Anyway, so that's the one way and then the other way would be, like, lean really
00:38:58 hard into the Sonichu thing, but in that way it's like- it's a game about killing Sonichus.
00:39:02 Yeah.
00:39:03 Phantom's Revenge.
00:39:04 The game about killing Sonichus.
00:39:05 The game about taking revenge on Sonichus.
00:39:07 The game about- the game that ended Sonichu forever.
00:39:09 It's the- it's the end of Sonichu.
00:39:11 It's- you kill him.
00:39:12 Um, and I was thinking about this because I was reading, like, articles and listicles
00:39:18 about, like, how to market your indie game and, uh-
00:39:22 Make it about killing a real person's stuff.
00:39:26 A real person's stuff.
00:39:28 Oh, that's like- that's the advice.
00:39:31 Yeah.
00:39:32 Yeah.
00:39:33 Uh, no.
00:39:34 None of them said that.
00:39:35 Um, uh, some of them, they were talking about, like, uh, I don't know.
00:39:43 I'm getting sad just thinking about it, because a lot- a lot of what I read was, like, oh,
00:39:49 you need to be- you need to be sending emails.
00:39:50 You need to be sending, like, emails to, like, people to, like, YouTubers and- and journalists
00:39:58 and, like, video game people, just people with clout, just send them emails about your
00:40:02 game.
00:40:03 So, you're sending emails and here's how to write a press release and a press email?
00:40:05 Yeah.
00:40:06 I mean, that's not too difficult.
00:40:07 Once you've written it the first time, you just send it- find what you're sending it
00:40:11 to.
00:40:12 Well, here's- so they- well, yeah, how do you do that?
00:40:14 Like, genuinely, that's the hard part.
00:40:16 Who do I send it to?
00:40:17 Uh, I mean, I was sending, uh, or rather, Charlie sent, uh, we wrote, like, emails, uh, being
00:40:27 like, hey, this is a pumpkin alley, this is a 3D platformer, maybe you'd enjoy it.
00:40:32 And we send it to a few people who play 3D platformer games.
00:40:35 I don't think any of them, like, noticed, uh, but whatever.
00:40:39 It's just a demo right now.
00:40:42 How did you find those people?
00:40:43 How did you assemble that list?
00:40:45 Um, it wasn't that many people.
00:40:47 Charlie had just been, like, looking at, like, smaller YouTubers who talk about those sorts
00:40:53 of things, like, 3D platformer enthusiasts, um, thinking, okay, this guy's got a couple
00:40:59 thousand subscribers.
00:41:01 They talk about platforming games.
00:41:02 They also specifically talk about, like, new and upcoming things that you'd get excited
00:41:07 for.
00:41:08 So, like, potentially, there's a chance we can get featured on that.
00:41:12 So, like, aim low in terms of, like, clout to begin with, because nobody knows what your
00:41:19 thing is.
00:41:20 Yeah.
00:41:21 Um, you're not gonna, like, immediately get front-paged on some big thing, although it
00:41:26 doesn't hurt to try, I guess.
00:41:28 Yeah.
00:41:29 I mean, even when I was, like, starting out hypocrite, I would, like, email a bunch of
00:41:32 my favorite YouTubers.
00:41:33 I would email John Tron and Peanut Butter Gamer saying, hey, uh, maybe you think this
00:41:37 is cool.
00:41:38 I don't know.
00:41:39 Yeah.
00:41:40 It was, like, really embarrassing, but, like, it's possible.
00:41:44 I mean, I, um, I may have mentioned this once or twice, but, uh, when I was doing, um,
00:41:51 when I started doing, it's all so ugly, you know, my, my short-lived, uh, uh, what do
00:41:56 we call it?
00:41:57 Like, what's the word for whatever it was?
00:42:01 Webcomic?
00:42:02 Website?
00:42:03 Yeah.
00:42:04 I feel like more, more specifically, I want to call it, like, a three-panel comic, but
00:42:07 it wasn't, like, three panels.
00:42:08 Whatever.
00:42:09 Like, my comedic joke strip that didn't last, whatever.
00:42:13 Uh, I, I emailed a bunch of, um, yeah, emailed a bunch of other comics people, and I asked
00:42:19 if they wanted to, like, uh, you know, like, do, like, a comic trade, like, you know, I,
00:42:25 they post one on my site, I post one on their site.
00:42:28 Um, I didn't get much reply, except, funnily, I did get a reply from the guy who does Death
00:42:35 Bulge, but I got a, like, yeah, it's, it's a comic.
00:42:40 Uh, I think it also, I think they, they made a video game, a tie-in, like, I think it might
00:42:45 have been a few years ago at this point.
00:42:47 What is it with comics and video games and the people who make them?
00:42:50 I don't know.
00:42:52 Man, dog, people just be, like, liking video games and shit.
00:42:58 Um, the, the, um, what was I talking, oh yeah, Death Bulge, man, made a, oh, he, he replied,
00:43:09 but he was like, ah, I wish, I kind of wish he didn't reply, because he, because he replied
00:43:16 being like, yeah, maybe we could do something like that, and I'm a complete nobody, right?
00:43:19 I have no clout, like, there's nothing, there's nothing in it for him, but I, but I, you know,
00:43:26 I was like, but he was smaller at the time.
00:43:28 He was not, he was, you know, I'd heard of him, so he was not nobody, but Death Bulge
00:43:32 definitely got bigger since then, that I, you know, he replied being like, yeah, maybe
00:43:37 we could do something like that, and I was like, okay, well, like, uh, you know, uh,
00:43:42 I tried to, like, you know, press further, be like, well, you know, how about, you know,
00:43:46 what do you want to do?
00:43:47 Like, I'll, I'll, I'll draw a strip in the Death Bulge, so do you want to draw something
00:43:49 that looks like mine, my style, we trade, and then he, he comes back and he's like, uh, yeah,
00:43:55 I mean, might be able to do something like that soon, like, maybe be able to do, could,
00:44:01 I'm not sure when exactly, uh, and like, I think I might have tried, like, one more time,
00:44:07 be like, okay, well, uh, you know, here, I don't know if I drew, I should have drawn
00:44:13 something, I'm thinking back in what I should have then done, what I should have then done
00:44:18 is drawn a, like, haha, this is my take on Death Bulge strip and just showed it to him,
00:44:24 and then maybe he would have been like, haha, I like it, okay, here, I'll draw one for you,
00:44:28 I don't think I did that, that's what I should have done, but nevertheless, he kind of just
00:44:33 continued to sort of, sort of, uh, noncommittally reply a couple times until I think I eventually
00:44:39 got the picture and was like, well, I guess this isn't happening, uh, hmm, hmm, yeah,
00:44:46 if I wanted to make that happen, I should have taken, I should have taken the next step,
00:44:49 I'm thinking about it, hmm, yeah, I guess I fucked up, oh well, it sure is really hard
00:44:59 getting your creative work known by anyone, yeah, in my head, I'm thinking, okay, as long
00:45:07 as I keep making, getting better at doing what I do, eventually I'll make something
00:45:11 that's so good that I won't even have to try, yeah, that's the dream, right, that's
00:45:18 the dream is you can just make it and you don't have to worry about, like, God, an email
00:45:22 list, like, kill me, like, shoot me in the fucking head, hmm, hmm, yeah, I mean, the hard
00:45:29 part for that, more than just writing the email, because I think I've gotten better
00:45:33 at, like, just sending emails, if you just gave me a list of 100 people to email, I would
00:45:40 just, yeah, share whatever, I just write 100 emails, like, I don't care, but how do I,
00:45:46 but how would I, what's so difficult about finding them, you just, like, Google,
00:45:52 who, who, who, comics, websites, and find people from links from links, and then be like, okay,
00:46:00 this person seems like the same sort of size, a little higher, I'll just email them, write
00:46:07 it down in a note, it'll just take, like, a day maybe of research, I don't know, I can't,
00:46:13 okay, well, I've lived my entire life, and I genuinely cannot think of even a single
00:46:19 person who I would email to tell them about Phantom's Revenge, and say, like, hey, check
00:46:24 this game I made out, maybe you'd like to, well, yeah, with Phantom's Revenge, it's
00:46:29 a little weird, yeah, exactly, not just because the three things that are involved, there's
00:46:36 ponies, there's Endless War, which you're already, like, you know, you're part of that,
00:46:42 you made it, and, and the Sonichu, like, Sonichu's super toxic, the people in the Sonichu
00:46:52 verse are like, they hate you, or they would hate you, mostly, mostly they hate you, just
00:46:58 because, because they, you know, transphobes and all that.
00:47:02 That's part of it.
00:47:03 Um, and then the pony stuff is like, sort of, sort of toxic in its own way.
00:47:12 Yeah, but like, two outsiders, it's considered, it's crazy, the pony, the pony, like, community
00:47:17 is like, disbanded largely, and the big names are all like doing different things, and like,
00:47:23 either distance themselves, or like, not interested in pony anymore.
00:47:27 Yeah, the people who are left are like, I don't know, I don't know too much about them, but
00:47:31 I don't think they're cool.
00:47:33 They're just furries, pretty much.
00:47:35 Well, yeah, I mean, like, but like, there's nothing exciting going on in that space, as
00:47:41 far as I know.
00:47:41 Not really.
00:47:43 Not really, no.
00:47:44 There's no up and comers anymore, because there's nothing to strive for, like, what, what, what,
00:47:49 what sort of person sees the Brony community and thing, and has a twinkle in their eye and
00:47:53 starts their career.
00:47:55 Yeah, there's no one doing that, it's just old people, old guard who are like, just
00:48:01 committed to talking about pony on their channel or whatever.
00:48:05 Yeah, and then everyone with talent has branched out, like, Living Toonstone and, and
00:48:11 God, what's her name?
00:48:13 Jenny, Jenny Nicholson, right.
00:48:17 I mean, even Save Your Spark, you know, all those, they just doing other things.
00:48:24 So, I mean, so there, so there you go.
00:48:27 So you wonder, so you understand my dilemma.
00:48:30 I do.
00:48:32 Yeah, there's no one you could send this to.
00:48:36 But you said you already knew that, kind of, you knew it was super niche, niche.
00:48:43 Yeah.
00:48:44 Yeah, I did.
00:48:46 I did.
00:48:48 I feel like there probably is an angle.
00:48:51 There probably is some angle I could, I could sell it with to somebody.
00:48:56 I just don't know, I just don't know who.
00:48:59 I mean, do you think it's worth, like, just because you don't go into, like, your
00:49:04 own opinions of, of Chris Chan and all that, it's mostly just about killing
00:49:07 Sonichu and Nightstar.
00:49:10 If you went into, like, Sonichu or Chris Chan related spaces and say, hey, you
00:49:15 want to kill a bunch of Sonichus?
00:49:18 Like, you would get some people having a look, I guess.
00:49:21 Yeah, sure.
00:49:23 I'm not, I'm not above that.
00:49:25 I'm not above that.
00:49:27 And yet, like, honestly, I mean, I haven't, I kind of wonder, I mean, I
00:49:31 guess there's like the, I mean, there's the quickie.
00:49:34 But the quickie is like, okay, I guess there's like a board.
00:49:39 There is a board.
00:49:41 I wonder if Slash CWC even exists anymore.
00:49:47 I'm not, I'm not above, uh, dipping into that well.
00:49:52 But also, I'm not sure how much of it exists.
00:49:56 You know what?
00:49:57 It's, it's, it's Kiwi Farms now.
00:49:59 Like the, the, the Chris Chan community is just Kiwi Farms.
00:50:03 Yep.
00:50:05 I would, I would imagine so.
00:50:07 And, uh, and we know how they feel about me, which is fine.
00:50:13 I don't care.
00:50:15 Uh, I don't know.
00:50:18 I don't know if they're interested.
00:50:19 I don't know if they're interested in a game that I made.
00:50:21 They're interested in like, is Chris going to jail?
00:50:26 Like what is Chris writing in her letters from jail, et cetera, et cetera.
00:50:33 Si.
00:50:34 So I just don't, yeah, I just don't know if there's that much potential there.
00:50:38 Uh, I feel like the only hope it has is like people, I don't know, people who
00:50:47 just like weird stuff.
00:50:52 Um, and I mean, I like weird stuff.
00:50:56 So like, that can't be a complete, they can't be nobody, right?
00:51:03 I don't know.
00:51:04 Like, um, there must be some sort of a community out there that would see it
00:51:09 and be like, what a, what a, what an oddity.
00:51:13 What a curious, what a curious artifact you suppose.
00:51:16 Okay.
00:51:16 Well, well, I don't know.
00:51:19 I don't know the entire internet.
00:51:22 Yeah.
00:51:23 I'm trying to stay positive here.
00:51:25 What, what sorts of people, um, I guess, I don't know where you would find
00:51:31 people who like weird shit specifically.
00:51:35 Yeah.
00:51:37 Unfortunately, they may not even be like online that much.
00:51:40 That's, I should start, I should start a 4chan thread about it.
00:51:42 Why not?
00:51:44 On a slash MLP.
00:51:48 Law.
00:51:49 I mean, what, I mean, why not?
00:51:51 Yeah.
00:51:51 Um, honestly, not even something, not a terrible idea.
00:51:55 Maybe I will fucking do it.
00:51:57 Uh, who cares?
00:52:00 You know what?
00:52:01 There's no rules.
00:52:03 There's no God in heaven judging my actions.
00:52:07 There's only the devil.
00:52:09 There's only the devil and he lives in, in me and he tells me to do these things.
00:52:15 He tells me to make this game in spite of knowing that it has no audience.
00:52:21 And then tells me find the audience then, make an email list then.
00:52:28 You got to, you got, you got to get this on the front page of the question daily.
00:52:34 Uh, thanks again to Oblivionfall for, uh, thanks again to Oblivionfall for
00:52:40 telling Cepisto to put it there.
00:52:43 Cause it really is, it really is like it doesn't matter.
00:52:46 It really just doesn't matter what you do.
00:52:48 Uh, it's just, it's just, do you know a guy?
00:52:51 At the end of the day.
00:52:53 Yeah.
00:52:54 I was reading a, I was reading, it was one of those like, get your indie game
00:53:00 scene, get your, like, indie game published thing.
00:53:03 And it was like, yeah, some indies will like partner with a, you know, the
00:53:08 partner with like, you know, a bigger studio or a publisher, you know, for
00:53:14 marketing and it, and it literally is like the, the single biggest thing that
00:53:19 those people can do for you is that they'll know a guy.
00:53:24 Cause they know, cause publishers know everyone.
00:53:26 So they'll know a guy who can maybe get you like a table at a, at a, at a, um,
00:53:30 an expo or something.
00:53:32 And just like, that's the only way to do it.
00:53:34 You got to know a guy.
00:53:35 And if you don't know a guy, you got to like, you got to find people that know
00:53:40 guys and like pay the money for the, for the guys that they know.
00:53:46 Uh, it's just, it's just, uh, it's just a cruel world.
00:53:49 Um,
00:53:53 Yup.
00:53:57 Uh, okay.
00:53:58 Well, that's, that's all.
00:54:00 Anyway, I went to the library and I'm waiting for those books.
00:54:06 Um,
00:54:08 Uh,
00:54:10 something else.
00:54:11 Let's change the subject.
00:54:13 Um, well, I, I sent, I'm, I'm beginning to send the rest of the Lord of
00:54:18 ghosts things.
00:54:20 Um,
00:54:22 I sent my first few packages now that the ghost costumes are done.
00:54:27 So the, the packages, including like the plush, I think Simsies is on its way.
00:54:33 Oh good.
00:54:34 So Simsie will get his and a few others.
00:54:38 Um,
00:54:39 I'm going to do, try to do another big like bunch going to America,
00:54:44 right before the end of the month.
00:54:46 And I don't know, just like every day I could, I could fill out the, uh,
00:54:52 fill out the fucking thing and the customs and just put it all together.
00:54:57 I still need to do the doodles.
00:54:59 I don't have like,
00:55:01 I think I need to go and get some cool pens or just some good enough pens to
00:55:07 start doing those.
00:55:09 Hmm.
00:55:10 Bah, but, you know, there's plenty of that I can spend my time sending that
00:55:16 don't have doodles and I'm going to just get through as many of those as I
00:55:20 can as quick as possible.
00:55:24 And then, uh, there'll be less stuff in my room, cluttering it up.
00:55:30 I need, I need to check my PO box.
00:55:33 I haven't checked my PO box in a while.
00:55:35 I'm afraid that it's like overflowing with packages that have been returned to
00:55:38 me.
00:55:40 You know, I send a lot of packages.
00:55:42 Yeah.
00:55:43 You, you mentioned you were going to check it last week.
00:55:46 Yeah.
00:55:46 I was going to, and then, uh, I had a thing to do around that area.
00:55:51 Cause my, my PO box is in a different town because it's near my old address.
00:55:56 So, uh, I had a thing to do in the area that I was going to check my PO box
00:56:03 while I was there.
00:56:03 And then it turned out, oh, the thing was on a Sunday and post offices
00:56:06 aren't on Sundays.
00:56:07 Oops.
00:56:08 Uh, so I didn't do it.
00:56:09 So, uh, yep.
00:56:15 So I haven't, still haven't done it.
00:56:16 Uh, gotta do it.
00:56:19 It's just so annoying.
00:56:20 I have to take the butt.
00:56:21 I have to take like two buses to get there.
00:56:23 It takes like, it probably takes me like two or three hours.
00:56:25 Just let go and like check my fucking PO box.
00:56:28 Who wants to do that?
00:56:30 Although I guess it's getting, I guess it's getting warm out.
00:56:32 So it's a little, it's a little less miserable.
00:56:36 It's nice going on walks.
00:56:38 Um, I think, uh, the, the post office, the delivery office with royal mail is quite
00:56:46 good.
00:56:47 I buy the thing online and then I have like a QR code email to me.
00:56:52 So I can bring the packages to the delivery office and say, Hey, um, could
00:56:56 you put labels on these and send them?
00:56:58 Thanks.
00:56:59 And then they just print the labels right then and there.
00:57:02 So that's pretty good.
00:57:03 I don't know whether they can do that for customs labels.
00:57:06 So I bought a bunch of labels for that.
00:57:08 If I can, if I need to do them at home.
00:57:12 Uh, I also, last time I went or a few times ago when I went to the post office,
00:57:18 uh, they made me wait.
00:57:22 They made me, uh, wait in line.
00:57:26 I would, I would always like wait in line.
00:57:28 And then I would get to the thing, get to the desk and be like, here, here's my
00:57:32 domestic packages and here's my international package.
00:57:35 And they'd be like, okay, and they'd sign off the domestic ones.
00:57:38 And then they'd be like, here, for these international packages, you've got
00:57:40 to take these slips and fill them out.
00:57:43 And so go over there.
00:57:44 And then I'd go and I'd fill out the slips and then I'd get back in line
00:57:46 and wait a second time and then I'd send the international ones.
00:57:49 So the one, so I finally was like, I got you suckers and there was a stack
00:57:55 of those slips and I stole them.
00:57:57 I stole a big stack of those slips.
00:57:59 And now I just have them and now I can fill them out beforehand.
00:58:03 So when I get there, I can be like, I already got them.
00:58:06 I only have to wait in line one time.
00:58:08 All the international ones are all, because it's not enough.
00:58:12 It's not enough to just write the info on the package.
00:58:15 You also must fill out a slip with the same information.
00:58:19 And then they must take that slip from you and look at it and painstakingly type
00:58:25 in all the information you wrote on the slip into their little computer and print
00:58:30 out a label that says that information and then stick that label on, on the
00:58:35 that seems so, so old fashioned, I guess, a bit like with the Royal Mail thing.
00:58:43 Like you do all that online when you purchase the, the, the, the postage.
00:58:49 And so they had, they can, they can just like print the label.
00:58:53 Well, they give you like what the, the, the print, the label print like PDF.
00:58:58 So you, if you want to print it yourself.
00:59:00 Oh, really?
00:59:01 Take it in.
00:59:02 Yeah.
00:59:02 If you got like label paper, you can print it at home.
00:59:04 And then stick it on and then just bring it in and drop it off.
00:59:07 I wonder if there's a way to do that with the USPS.
00:59:14 And not that I know of, but I could be missing something.
00:59:16 That would be a little, that would be a little more convenient.
00:59:19 I used to have, I used to use a website called stamps.com that lets you,
00:59:25 I don't know if it would let you do international labels, but it would let
00:59:27 you print your own stamps of any denominational, like you could specifically
00:59:31 print like a dollar, $1.09 stamp, if you wanted.
00:59:38 But it had like a fucking monthly fee.
00:59:42 It was like $20 a month and it literally would not let me cancel.
00:59:46 Like I tried to cancel and they were like, are you sure you want to cancel?
00:59:52 And it brought me back to the website and, and, and it was the same website,
00:59:56 but the cancel button was gone.
00:59:58 Like it was just gone.
00:59:59 And I was like, okay, so this website's a scam.
01:00:02 Even though it works, even though it literally works and seems to be endorsed
01:00:06 by the United States Post Office, it just is a scam.
01:00:08 It's scamming me.
01:00:09 So I had to call my credit cards and be like, hey, do not authorize payments
01:00:13 to this company.
01:00:14 Simply stop paying them.
01:00:15 And they'd be like, well, we have to give you a new credit card.
01:00:17 It's like, fine.
01:00:18 Cancel my old card.
01:00:20 Give me a new card so that I can stop paying these devils.
01:00:25 Couldn't you have like, like customer support called and say,
01:00:29 did you please stop charging me?
01:00:32 Well, that's, oh, you mean to stamps.com?
01:00:35 Yeah, to the.com.
01:00:39 Maybe I could have done that.
01:00:40 I, I feel like I, yeah, maybe I could have, I mean, I exhausted,
01:00:46 I exhausted all of the web, web-based methods I could find.
01:00:51 And I felt like that was proof of their ill intent.
01:00:56 I just didn't trust them.
01:00:58 I just didn't trust them that they were going to actually let me quit,
01:01:00 no matter how bad I wanted to.
01:01:02 Yeah.
01:01:03 So, uh, oh well.
01:01:09 Anyway, so that's, so that's, once again, I don't remember how we got here.
01:01:17 I was just talking about Lord of Ghosts.
01:01:19 Oh, right.
01:01:20 Yes.
01:01:20 Yes.
01:01:21 Actually, that's a fairly, a fairly direct through line now that you mentioned it.
01:01:25 Yeah.
01:01:26 So like, aside from the doodles of which there are many, but like not like an unbelievable,
01:01:32 like I would die sort of amount.
01:01:34 It's just sort of, I want to first get as many of these like that are, that I can packaged and sent
01:01:44 and hopefully before April, because like that April is like text
01:01:50 moment, like everything before that.
01:01:53 I forget which date, maybe it's the first of April or the end of April or some number.
01:01:57 One of the dates would be like the text thing.
01:02:02 And so like the income I got from the Kickstarter and then like spent would be part of that text here.
01:02:10 And then I could write it off from that text here.
01:02:12 Yes.
01:02:13 Yes.
01:02:14 So you want to wait.
01:02:16 So you're waiting.
01:02:18 You're waiting.
01:02:18 I'm not waiting.
01:02:19 Oh, you're not waiting.
01:02:20 I'm not waiting.
01:02:21 I'm trying to get it done before April, before the next text here takes over.
01:02:26 I don't know what I'm doing, but I have just a feeling that like,
01:02:31 since the income from the Kickstarter was in that text here.
01:02:37 And then if I spend as much of the money that I was required to spend for the Kickstarter before
01:02:44 the next text here takes over, then I could do my taxes for that year and not pay
01:02:51 anything, because I would get a bunch of income from the Kickstarter, but then it would all be like,
01:02:55 oh, this is, I spent it on like what it was supposed to be, including the postage.
01:03:03 I really should have done all of this earlier.
01:03:06 But you know, making a fucking video game in the meantime.
01:03:12 So you want to wait.
01:03:14 So you want to report your income and your expenses in the same year.
01:03:18 That's what you want to do, so that they cancel each other out.
01:03:22 Yes.
01:03:22 So it doesn't count as like super, I don't know.
01:03:26 You know, when like you go over the money and you can't write enough stuff off,
01:03:30 then you actually have to pay taxes and that sucks.
01:03:33 That's bad.
01:03:34 That's bad.
01:03:36 So yeah, yeah, but sure, you don't want to imagine like paying taxes on a bunch of money that you made
01:03:46 and then and but then like had to spend on something else.
01:03:50 But then you, there was like a delay so you didn't get to report
01:03:54 the that you spent the money on the thing.
01:03:57 You paid the taxes on it as though you weren't going to spend it.
01:04:00 No, that wouldn't be right.
01:04:01 That wouldn't be.
01:04:02 Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's like ways you can say, well, there's like,
01:04:08 I haven't spent the money yet, but I will because of like this.
01:04:12 And you can write that in somewhere.
01:04:13 I feel like I've seen that.
01:04:16 But it's like a lot of business jargon and a lot of like, I don't get it.
01:04:20 I'm just typing in numbers that are basically correct.
01:04:25 Sure.
01:04:25 Then I get my tax return and they say, wow, you're okay.
01:04:29 I thank fuck.
01:04:32 You got to do your best.
01:04:35 At the end of the day.
01:04:38 Well, things considered, Texas is quite easy to like figure out.
01:04:44 It just takes a while.
01:04:46 I guess I got to pay mine.
01:04:47 I guess, well, I guess the deadline is like three weeks from now.
01:04:51 So I guess I actually kind of got to do that somewhat soon.
01:04:55 And that sucks.
01:04:56 I'm sure I'll file for an extension.
01:04:58 I always do.
01:05:03 I have all my forms.
01:05:07 I got all my forms from like Google AdSense and Patreon and whoever the fuck else.
01:05:17 Taxes are actually going to be kind of shit.
01:05:19 Taxes are going to be kind of shitty this year because I got a bunch of them.
01:05:23 Because I got a bunch of COVID unemployment and you have to pay money on unemployment benefits.
01:05:29 Yeah, it sucks.
01:05:31 Yeah.
01:05:31 I mean, I'm not complaining because I did get a bunch of free money,
01:05:36 but I will have to pay some of it back.
01:05:38 So I don't like that part, but I'll do it.
01:05:42 I'll do it.
01:05:43 God damn it.
01:05:49 Why don't they just take that out if they're going to?
01:05:52 If they're going to make me pay it.
01:05:53 It's fine.
01:05:54 It's fine.
01:06:02 I had two more things on my stupid list of shit I wanted to talk about.
01:06:07 Is that okay?
01:06:11 Yes, it's fine.
01:06:12 I don't have too much to say either because it's mostly just been like, I don't know.
01:06:20 I guess the only other thing is that I've got another appointment
01:06:23 set for laser hair removal on my arms, which is like, well, I'm just doing that now.
01:06:31 I'm zapping my arms with lasers and my hair will stop coming back.
01:06:35 It's not much to say about it.
01:06:38 When did you start doing that?
01:06:41 It was only a few days ago.
01:06:42 I had my first session.
01:06:44 Oh, that was your...
01:06:45 You mentioned it on the last episode.
01:06:46 That was your first one?
01:06:48 For my arms, yeah.
01:06:50 I had been doing it on my face for the last year, and that has been going pretty well.
01:06:58 There's only a few little patches that keep coming back, and I'm like, okay,
01:07:00 I need to do some more on that.
01:07:06 I'd finished my 10 sessions and they're like four weeks apart.
01:07:10 God wanted you to have hair there?
01:07:13 No, no, he made a mistake.
01:07:15 He put it there.
01:07:17 Well, he made a little oopsie.
01:07:20 He made a little oopsie, and also I piss on God.
01:07:23 I shit on his grave because it doesn't know what he's doing.
01:07:30 No need for you to piss off all of our God-loving fans.
01:07:35 No need for you to trample on my free speech by saying that.
01:07:41 You're not allowed to say that.
01:07:43 No, I think it's fun to trample on your free speech, Ben St, and I will do so forever.
01:07:49 Sound by it, sound by it, sound by it.
01:07:57 I had the 10 sessions four weeks apart for a while, and I was like, okay, they're over now.
01:08:06 Now I don't have any more appointments coming up, and I liked that for a bit.
01:08:11 It was like, okay, I don't have to go into that.
01:08:15 But then my hair a little bit started coming through the top lip,
01:08:18 and there's a bit under my chin.
01:08:20 I was like, okay, this is starting to feel sucks.
01:08:24 I don't like it.
01:08:25 And so I was feeling a little down just because of I'd feel in it there and being like,
01:08:29 I shave it and it comes back.
01:08:30 It's just like how it was before, but the majority of the hair is gone forever.
01:08:35 It's just little bits.
01:08:37 So I finally sorted everything out because I had that hanging over my head.
01:08:41 I had the pumpkin alley hotfix pumpkin patch that we were working on getting done quicker.
01:08:51 And then there was the fucking, there's always a lot of ghost stuff to do.
01:08:55 There was the ghosts to make the costume for the ghost plush.
01:09:00 And so there's all these things going on.
01:09:02 And I'm like, God, I just, ah, and it's a little overwhelming for a few weeks there.
01:09:11 But I finally got the next appointment.
01:09:13 I called them up.
01:09:14 It was just one of those days where it's like, everything's fucked and I need to get this thing
01:09:18 done.
01:09:19 So I called them on the phone and I got an appointment and it was so easy.
01:09:23 But it was like, I don't like calling on the phone.
01:09:27 Is it expensive?
01:09:30 For, they said for eight new sessions on the face and eight sessions on the arms,
01:09:36 that comes to around like a thousand pounds.
01:09:39 So it's, it's expensive, I guess, but I'm paying it off like in monthly installments.
01:09:46 I feel that I can, that's worth just because it makes me feel so much better.
01:09:54 Sure.
01:09:56 But you know, expensive, patreon.com slash give and take.
01:10:02 Yeah, sure.
01:10:04 I remembered, by the way, I remembered how we got on the transracial thing.
01:10:08 It was the white sal, the white lizard.
01:10:10 That's, okay, okay.
01:10:16 Yeah, that makes sense.
01:10:18 Yeah, you, oh yeah, you should play the pumpkin patch, by the way, because it's not just the
01:10:25 secrets.
01:10:25 There's also the gameplay, the game feels a little different, maybe a little tighter.
01:10:29 Do you want to mention what you changed?
01:10:34 Um, I mean, the patch notes explain in quite a lot of detail what changed.
01:10:41 But like, there's things like,
01:10:45 yeah, see pumpkin alley, pumpkin patch, like devlog, if you scroll down, you'll see it on the page.
01:10:52 Charlie, charlie-batten.itch.io.
01:10:56 Yep.
01:10:58 Here, oh yeah, pumpkin patch.
01:11:00 Yeah.
01:11:00 Oh, there's, it's quite, yeah, there's quite a few things here.
01:11:03 Yeah, some of it's technical.
01:11:06 If you don't know about things you might not understand, but like,
01:11:10 we're just like listing the things we were working on and being like, okay, what literally is
01:11:14 different, jumping is different in brief, jumping is different.
01:11:21 There's like collision differences when getting up to an edge of a platform and like,
01:11:28 like being stuck on the platform when you jump on it.
01:11:31 There's a few animation changes.
01:11:33 It's just sort of like cleaning it up based on what people were saying
01:11:36 and what we already wanted to make look better.
01:11:39 You can turn the camera higher up so you can look up more.
01:11:45 And yeah, lots of little, no, no drastic new content.
01:11:51 Some of the geometry has changed.
01:11:52 Some of the decorations have been altered.
01:11:55 And it's harder, not impossible, but it's harder to get out of bounds now.
01:11:59 So the path forwards is more clear and like signpost, like you don't accidentally feel like
01:12:09 you're going the right way when you're like going out of bounds and jumping on top of the hills.
01:12:15 Removed a bit of clouds for performance, huh?
01:12:18 That's interesting.
01:12:19 Yeah, the clouds objects, there were two of them.
01:12:23 But instead of like, they're like generating like, it's like a particle effect,
01:12:27 but just really big particles on the clouds at the top.
01:12:32 There were two of those to fit over the whole level, but we changed it to one.
01:12:36 And then that one like tracks the position of the player and like,
01:12:39 it only renders in a certain radius around where the player is.
01:12:44 So that saves on performance.
01:12:46 And then there was some other stuff like people in different language computers,
01:12:52 the signs weren't like, they were translating strangely,
01:12:55 or they just weren't showing the text.
01:12:57 So there's lots of little glitches, hopefully those are all fixed.
01:13:01 Opening the photo album didn't work for some people.
01:13:07 And that's the gist anyway.
01:13:17 My patch was much shorter than this.
01:13:19 A couple of people have said that a couple of people have reported
01:13:23 a like getting a soft lock in the Phantom's Revenge,
01:13:28 but I have not, I have not been able to like duplicate the conditions
01:13:32 that anyone has described it happening on there.
01:13:34 Only two people have said it happened.
01:13:37 And I have gotten and tried to do what they did to make it happen.
01:13:39 I have not been able to do it.
01:13:41 So there may be a bug in there somewhere.
01:13:45 I just don't know what it is.
01:13:47 If I ever identify it and what's causing like a small amount of people to get that.
01:13:52 You should definitely ask them what of course system, no, I mean like what computer they're using.
01:14:02 If it changes randomly on different like operating systems.
01:14:06 Well Keyblade said she was running the game,
01:14:09 she launched the game from Steam, which is a thing I didn't know you could do.
01:14:14 But she said probably that steam.
01:14:17 Yeah, like she launched it through the Steam launcher.
01:14:20 I guess you can like you can like tie non-Steam games to the Steam launcher.
01:14:26 I just launched them through Steam.
01:14:28 Weird.
01:14:30 Yeah.
01:14:31 So I don't know.
01:14:32 She said maybe that might have something to do with it.
01:14:35 I think some people have maybe, I think sometimes it's not actually a soft lock.
01:14:40 It's just like the game gets a little stuck.
01:14:42 And if you like wait a little bit or like you hit spacebar a couple times,
01:14:46 the game will eventually advance.
01:14:47 It just gets a little bit like hung up, which is bad.
01:14:52 And if I knew how to, and if I knew what was causing that,
01:14:55 I would fix that as well, even if it's not a soft lock.
01:14:59 I haven't been able to replicate it.
01:15:01 I think it's usually has to do with when Virginia dies and like
01:15:06 the cutscene is trying to play of a phantom like being like, no, Virginia.
01:15:11 I think that can sometimes cause a little bit of like,
01:15:16 the cutscene can sort of like get stuck temporarily.
01:15:20 But yeah, that seems to be what people have said.
01:15:23 But again, I haven't duplicated it and I haven't figured out what has made that happen.
01:15:29 So I haven't fixed it.
01:15:33 I will if I ever get the chance.
01:15:37 I can actually, I'm pretty curious about the pumpkin patch.
01:15:39 I would like to boot it up and just like jump around a little bit
01:15:43 and see like, does it feel any different?
01:15:45 How much of a change do I notice?
01:15:48 There was an aspect of the jumping where people,
01:15:51 they didn't like how long they had to hold down the jump button
01:15:55 to get the maximum height out of the first jump.
01:15:58 So we changed that so that you don't have to hold it down quite so long.
01:16:02 And the second jump is like a fixed amount.
01:16:09 I don't know.
01:16:10 I played it and it was like, this is better.
01:16:12 This is like, it's hard to like define with words,
01:16:16 but like it just feels better.
01:16:18 It doesn't feel perfect.
01:16:19 I'm sure there'll be tweaks we make before the finished game is finished.
01:16:23 But this is good for the moment.
01:16:26 Yeah, neat.
01:16:28 Very cool.
01:16:28 I'm gonna, I'll probably look through this whole list in more,
01:16:34 in more detail later, because I'm interested.
01:16:38 Various alley-oop problems fixed.
01:16:42 Well, that's just not very helpful.
01:16:44 Yeah, those things with her like falling through the floor,
01:16:49 which should be mitigated.
01:16:52 I think it still happens if you throw it hard enough.
01:16:54 All right, I'm cracking open my second gridlock energy of the day.
01:17:00 It's one, it's one of those days.
01:17:03 It's a two gridlock morning, if you know what I mean.
01:17:08 I, yes, I know what you mean.
01:17:11 What? Oh.
01:17:14 Oh, that's not a, that's not a gridlock.
01:17:16 That's a, that's a bang, delish, strawberry kiss.
01:17:20 Okay, that's fine.
01:17:22 It's not, it's not what I was expecting.
01:17:24 It just has a similar color can.
01:17:30 Refreshing.
01:17:33 Um, I got two stupid things on my stupid list.
01:17:38 Here's one.
01:17:39 I was playing, a funny thing happened.
01:17:41 I was playing Hades.
01:17:43 I was talking to some dudes the other day.
01:17:48 Last weekend, I was talking to some dudes about Hades.
01:17:53 Munchie had not played it, but some other people had and we were discussing it and
01:18:00 we're talking about like the mythology stuff.
01:18:02 And I said, I think Zagreus is like, Zagreus is like an original character
01:18:06 for context.
01:18:07 Zagreus is the protagonist of Hades and he is the son of the, of the titular Hades, the god guy.
01:18:15 And I was, and I thought he was an original character for the game.
01:18:18 Hades didn't have a son.
01:18:19 Turns out he is not an original character.
01:18:22 He is in like old Greek writings, like not very much, but he is there.
01:18:28 But it's confusing because he is, he is sometimes called the son of Hades,
01:18:35 but he is also sometimes called, he's also sometimes a,
01:18:42 he's like the same as Dionysus.
01:18:46 He's like some, he's like an aspect of Dionysus and,
01:18:51 because like Zagreus is the son of Hades and Persephone and Dionysus is the son of Zeus and
01:18:57 Persephone and like, I don't know, there's some, but all, but the one who, the one who is the
01:19:04 Zagreus that is, is Dionysus was like killed by the Titans and eaten and like his parts were
01:19:10 cooked in pots or some shit.
01:19:13 There's like all the shit about Zagreus that just seems to be about a completely different
01:19:18 guy.
01:19:19 And I read this and I was like, well, that doesn't make any sense.
01:19:23 Probably a different author's thing going on.
01:19:26 I guess so.
01:19:29 I'm just going to remember just fun facts that I remember off the top of my head from reading
01:19:32 the Wikipedia article.
01:19:34 The name, the name Zagre, okay, Artemis, when you find one of her boons in the game,
01:19:39 she says Zagreus, your name means great hunter.
01:19:41 Haha, they must have been thinking of me when they named you.
01:19:46 And in fact, his name is not, does not mean great hunter.
01:19:52 It specifically means like, it means like pit trapper is a Zagre, a Zagre is a hole in the
01:20:01 ground meant to trap live animals in.
01:20:05 So yeah, his name means pit trapper.
01:20:09 Dude, that's just like in Minecraft when you don't want your horse wandering off and you
01:20:13 don't have a leash.
01:20:15 Yeah, I dig a hole and put them in there.
01:20:17 There, there you go.
01:20:18 He's the god of doing that.
01:20:22 So, so that's funny.
01:20:25 Anyway, anyway, so I read this and I was like, well, that's weird.
01:20:28 Anyway, now I know that.
01:20:29 And funnily enough, right as I read that, like literally, okay, like the day before I had read
01:20:35 that I had gotten a little cutscene in the game.
01:20:37 I had found a boon of Dionysus and Dionysus said like, hey, Zag, Zag man, hey, why don't
01:20:44 we play a little prank on Orpheus?
01:20:46 Why don't we like spin him like a tall tale about how we're like connected or something?
01:20:52 And then, and then after I read that wiki article, or the Wikipedia, not just any wiki,
01:20:58 uh, there, there, there upon began a funny little sort of subplot where every time Zagreus would
01:21:07 talk to Orpheus, he would tell him like, hey, so yeah, like, actually, you know, I was originally
01:21:14 born of like a snake from Zeus, and you know, I was actually like torn apart by the Titans,
01:21:21 and they ate my parts, except for my heart, and my heart actually grew into Dionysus.
01:21:26 And like, we're actually kind of like the same God.
01:21:29 And Orpheus is like, whoa, that's crazy.
01:21:32 And, and Zagreus is like, lol, fooled him.
01:21:37 So I felt like I read, I don't know, I was just like, haha, I have the context to get this joke
01:21:44 now, because I read the Wikipedia article.
01:21:47 That's a very, very, if I, I guess if I didn't know that, I would just think it was like a
01:21:54 weird, funny, like, goofy thing that's in there.
01:21:57 But now I know it's like, oh, this is, this is inspired by like a weird, like, inconsistency
01:22:04 in these like ancient texts.
01:22:07 Just thought that was pretty neat.
01:22:09 Thought that was pretty neat.
01:22:10 Timing on that was pretty convenient.
01:22:13 Got that context right when I needed it.
01:22:15 Boyo, um, Skelly calls you Boyo.
01:22:21 He's a guy.
01:22:22 There's a skeleton.
01:22:23 Did you know there's a skeleton in the game, Gib?
01:22:25 No, I've never would have a guess.
01:22:27 You, there, believe it or not, there's a skeleton.
01:22:29 There's a, there's a funny skeleton who, uh, who hangs out in your courtyard and some
01:22:34 mysterious benefactor is paying him to stand there and let you beat the shit out of him
01:22:39 over and over again to, to practice with your weapons.
01:22:43 And he loves it.
01:22:44 And he's your best friend.
01:22:45 I got it.
01:22:46 No, un, un, not joking.
01:22:49 You know, he's like an NPC and you talk to him and he's really funny and I like him.
01:22:52 I like maxed out my friendship with him and he gave me the thing that lets you,
01:22:57 I didn't even realize this was a thing at all until he gave it to me.
01:23:00 And I was like, I can't believe this.
01:23:02 He, he gives me his like charm that lets me summon him in battle.
01:23:08 And his like thing that he does in battle is he, he does what he does in real life is
01:23:13 he just stands there and distracts your foes and your enemies just beat the shit out of him
01:23:18 until he dies and that's his use.
01:23:22 And I, I, I, unironically, which felt so heartwarming.
01:23:26 I was like, I can't believe Skelly is here with me in, in battle.
01:23:30 He's here and he's helping me in real life.
01:23:33 I can't believe it.
01:23:34 This is the most joyful thing.
01:23:38 What a pro.
01:23:38 A beautiful, beautiful moment.
01:23:41 Uh, it's great.
01:23:42 Skelly is great.
01:23:44 And I think he turns out he's voiced by the same guy who voices Zagreus.
01:23:49 And I really like Zag's voice actor.
01:23:52 He, he, he sounds so, um, he sounds so dignified all the time.
01:23:57 He's, he's, and then, you know, and then Skelly's just like, hey, hey, boy.
01:24:03 Oh, hey, uh, hey, why don't you hit me right in the vertebrae there?
01:24:06 Hey, give me, give me a shot right in the eye socket.
01:24:09 Um, uh, and they're the same guy.
01:24:12 And it's like, yeah, pretty good.
01:24:14 The future.
01:24:15 Huh?
01:24:16 Future Zagreus.
01:24:17 This is what happens to him.
01:24:19 I unlocked, uh, I unlocked one of my, I unlocked the final aspect of one of my weapons.
01:24:25 And, uh, it's the aspect of a future person.
01:24:30 I won't say who it is.
01:24:30 It's a spoiler.
01:24:32 But it's a guy who doesn't even exist yet, but you unlock it and he's like, whoa,
01:24:36 this is the, this is the blank weapon of blank, like a great king who doesn't even exist yet.
01:24:43 But I'm channeling his future power into my weapon and it's awesome.
01:24:50 I love Hades.
01:24:53 Um, anyway, that's been a lot of fun.
01:24:55 It's a good game.
01:24:56 It's a good ass video, it's just a good ass video game if you ask me.
01:25:00 Um, final thing on my stupid list.
01:25:04 This is an annoying thing that happened with my stupid roommates who I don't even know at all.
01:25:09 This guy, I think I might have, I think I might have alluded to this one guy who lives here,
01:25:14 who every now and then will pass through the kitchen and mutter something about, hey, you know,
01:25:20 I've got another letter from, uh, the guy who used to live here who says like,
01:25:26 yeah, I guess the electric bills are like still in his name and like,
01:25:30 you know, he wants us to like, you know, send him some money for that.
01:25:34 So like, you know, maybe I'm going to do that soon.
01:25:37 Okay, bye.
01:25:38 Well, he finally, he finally, uh, he finally, what's the word?
01:25:42 He finally dropped the hammer and he asked me like, hey, Ben, uh, you know, this guy,
01:25:49 that guy, you know, he wants the money for the electric bill.
01:25:52 I'm going to send him some money.
01:25:53 Like, can you give me some money to send him?
01:25:56 And he's just like, no, leave me alone.
01:26:02 What are you talking about?
01:26:04 Uh, he seemed, he seemed taken aback.
01:26:06 He seemed, he seemed taken aback, I guess from his perspective.
01:26:12 I don't know.
01:26:15 Are you not paying the electric bill?
01:26:17 Well, here, well, there's, well, here's the thing.
01:26:19 Here's the thing.
01:26:20 When I, when I moved in, the landlady says like here, there's no, she said, no,
01:26:25 you don't have to pay a utility bill.
01:26:26 You just pay the rent and whatever the internet costs, like you guys are
01:26:30 responsible for your own internet bills.
01:26:32 I don't provide internet, but she said, this is the rent, no utilities.
01:26:36 I was like, okay.
01:26:38 And then, uh, you know, and this, what this guy is always muttering about is like some,
01:26:45 he says that like the guy who used to live in my room, a guy who I have never met,
01:26:52 he claims that for some reason the electric bills or the gas bills or the power bills
01:27:02 are in his name and that he has been paying them for us, which doesn't make any sense.
01:27:13 Because this guy is not related to the landlord.
01:27:16 This guy is not like affiliated with the land.
01:27:21 He's just a guy who used to live here.
01:27:22 There's no, there's no reason why the bills would be in his name.
01:27:25 And furthermore, I see the bills that show up on the counter and they're addressed to occupant.
01:27:32 So I don't even think, I mean, I don't even have any evidence that this is even true,
01:27:37 that this, that this guy I've never met, who I don't see why he would be involved at all,
01:27:42 supposedly has these bills that are supposed to be for us and we should send him money about it.
01:27:48 So to me, this guy is just asking me to pay money to a guy I don't know,
01:27:53 that I was not supposed to have to pay for some mysterious bill that I've never seen.
01:27:59 So like, of course, I'm not going to do it.
01:28:01 But he seemed like, does this guy even exist?
01:28:04 Maybe this guy is just asking for money in a roundabout way.
01:28:07 I kind of think he is.
01:28:09 I kind of think he's just scamming this other guy.
01:28:11 And like, sorry, he seemed taken aback because he was like, he was like, well,
01:28:19 you know, the bills in this other guy, yeah, the bills in his name, he keeps getting the bill.
01:28:24 And I was like, well, let him pay it then.
01:28:26 Honestly, like, why, why would the electric bill, why would the power bill for this building
01:28:34 be a, be in the name of just a guy who lived here last year?
01:28:40 Why, like, there's no reason it would be like that.
01:28:42 Like, the landlady is, is responsible.
01:28:46 And this, and this guy, this muttering guy is like, uh, he's like, oh, well,
01:28:50 if we don't pay it, they'll shut the power off.
01:28:51 Like they won't shut the fucking power off.
01:28:53 The landlord is responsible for making sure the power doesn't shut off.
01:28:56 If they shut the power off, if the landlord is so negligent in the power bill that they
01:29:01 eventually, which I don't even think they're allowed to, I don't think they're like legally
01:29:04 allowed to just shut the power off to a building, at least they would have to give everyone living
01:29:08 their, like, notice.
01:29:11 So if, if, but if the landlady was so, uh, derelict in her duties that the, they just
01:29:16 shut the power off, I mean, that's something we take her to court over.
01:29:22 Because she's responsible for making, for making this place livable.
01:29:25 So there's no way that the power is just going to be shut off and it's, and it's going to be our fault.
01:29:29 So, I don't know, he seemed taken aback.
01:29:34 I, to me, it's unthinkable that I would have to pay for this.
01:29:40 So we're, we're at an impasse here and there's, but there's no way that he can compel me to
01:29:45 do what he wants me to do.
01:29:46 So I win.
01:29:51 Mucher is zero.
01:29:53 Speak louder.
01:29:54 I feel sorry for him.
01:29:56 He seems like, he seems like kind of a nice guy.
01:29:57 And I think he's just, I think he's just getting scammed.
01:30:00 But this is, but I, but I, this is what I've said to him in the, in the past when he's brought
01:30:04 up this bill thing, I've, I've, I've said to him, like, I don't know why this guy is even involved.
01:30:10 Like, why are you, you even talking to this guy?
01:30:12 Like, why is he like, I, this doesn't make any sense.
01:30:15 Like it seems weird.
01:30:16 Why is this our responsibility at all?
01:30:19 Et cetera, et cetera.
01:30:21 So it's not like this was like, it's, it's not like this was the first time I've expressed like,
01:30:25 this seems weird and I don't really get it.
01:30:27 It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense to me.
01:30:30 But, I don't know.
01:30:33 I was like, he was, I was like, let him pay it.
01:30:35 And he was like, wow, dude.
01:30:37 Wow.
01:30:38 Like, huh, that's so callus of you.
01:30:40 Oh, that's so, like,
01:30:45 Oh no, I don't want to be known as callus.
01:30:47 Like whatever, man.
01:30:50 Some nonsense.
01:30:54 But I, I doubt I'll, I doubt I'll be hearing about it again, because like there's just
01:31:00 there's just no, there's just no further, there's just no further anything to say about that.
01:31:07 I'm just, it's just nonsense.
01:31:09 It's just not going anywhere.
01:31:10 But it was annoying.
01:31:11 It's annoying.
01:31:12 And it had been building for a while because he even mentioned it.
01:31:14 And I, I could, I could sense, I could sense.
01:31:17 He started talking to me this time.
01:31:18 I was like, this is the time.
01:31:19 This is the time the hammer's dropping.
01:31:20 He's finally going to actually just come right out and be like,
01:31:23 hey, give me money for this thing.
01:31:26 And you know what?
01:31:27 I like, and I killed him.
01:31:28 He's dead.
01:31:30 Nice.
01:31:30 I buried him under the parking lot.
01:31:33 I buried, I buried him in the construction site in the, in the building that they're building
01:31:39 across the parking lot from my back lot.
01:31:43 He's going to, he's just going to be in the floor there.
01:31:45 He's, they're pouring the concrete.
01:31:47 So he's going to be in, in there.
01:31:49 I'm going to save him a little bit of concrete money.
01:31:52 That's going to be good.
01:31:55 Anyway, that's what, anyway, that's what happened.
01:31:58 And that's what happens.
01:32:00 And if you don't believe me, then fuck you.
01:32:07 Yeah.
01:32:09 Yeah.
01:32:10 Yeah.
01:32:10 Okay.
01:32:11 All right.
01:32:11 Well, that was my week.
01:32:15 That was my week too.
01:32:17 Nothing happened.
01:32:18 Nothing happened.
01:32:19 Nothing happened, but we sure did talk for an hour and a half, but you know,
01:32:22 that's not even that long.
01:32:23 That's nothing.
01:32:25 No.
01:32:25 You want to go to voicemails?
01:32:27 Uh, yeah.
01:32:28 I just got a P.
01:32:29 Sure.
01:32:33 I'm back.
01:32:35 I think I heard your mom.
01:32:37 Yeah, his food, but I'll get it later.
01:32:40 Is she Irish?
01:32:42 No.
01:32:44 Did she sound Irish?
01:32:45 I mean, it was a little hard to hear.
01:32:47 I thought, I thought maybe a little bit, but uh, I guess what do I know?
01:32:53 Where is she from?
01:32:55 England.
01:32:56 I mean, like, yeah, but which part?
01:33:00 Oh, uh, fucking, uh, Cheltenham, which is like south, south, it's sort of a posh-ish area,
01:33:10 south England.
01:33:14 All right.
01:33:14 Okay.
01:33:16 It was a bit, I mean, it was a bit kind of like in and out, like just barely breaking the,
01:33:20 the, uh, you know, the noise gate.
01:33:22 Yeah, the noise gate.
01:33:25 Uh, anyway, that was, that was funny.
01:33:29 Hi.
01:33:30 Hi, Gib.
01:33:31 Hi.
01:33:32 Uh, you're gonna come down, you're gonna come down for dinner.
01:33:35 Faith and, faith and begota.
01:33:38 No.
01:33:40 You're gonna come down and kiss the Blarney Stone, Gib.
01:33:44 No, don't you dare insinuate my mother is Irish.
01:33:49 Yeah, don't insinuate-
01:33:49 On Mother's Day.
01:33:50 Don't insinuate she's not white.
01:33:53 Of all day long.
01:33:55 Is today Mother's Day?
01:33:57 For me it is.
01:33:58 Right.
01:33:58 In May, May 8th in America, right?
01:34:01 Different, different days.
01:34:03 Different.
01:34:05 Did you hear that they, I think that I heard that like they, they canceled
01:34:08 daylight savings time in America?
01:34:11 Fucking cancel culture.
01:34:16 Yeah, I think I saw like articles that like,
01:34:20 yeah, they, they, or no, no, they didn't cancel it.
01:34:23 They made it permanent.
01:34:24 So it will never, it will never stop being daylight savings time ever again.
01:34:30 Uh, well, whatever.
01:34:34 I guess I'll hear about that when it relates to me.
01:34:37 Uh, right.
01:34:39 Well, I don't know, like, they just heard about this, like immediately after daylight
01:34:43 savings time, like a couple weeks ago, and I think, I'm sure next time it's
01:34:48 supposed to be daylight savings time, I will either hear,
01:34:51 yes, they really did cancel daylight savings time.
01:34:54 It's actually gone finally.
01:34:57 Or, oh yeah, no, it's, it's actually not gone.
01:35:02 Sorry, everyone.
01:35:02 It was almost gone, but then they were like, no, we were just kidding.
01:35:06 It'll be one or the other.
01:35:08 Breath, breathless thing pieces about why either one is the case.
01:35:13 Um, let's, let's listen to, you want to just listen to
01:35:17 them on speak pipe this time?
01:35:19 Sure.
01:35:20 Okay.
01:35:21 It's, I always get like fucked up, like moving the files into discord.
01:35:26 Oh, and logged out.
01:35:28 What's the password?
01:35:30 Uh, here I'll just, let me just say it out loud.
01:35:34 No, it's so secretive.
01:35:37 Let me just post a, let me just post a screenshot of the password in this discord
01:35:42 server where people other than our trusted confidants live.
01:35:51 We should have, I should have another guest on a mentioned cyber cyber shell.
01:35:56 I asked him if you wanted to be on last week and he said he could not make it,
01:35:58 but he would be on soon.
01:36:00 Did not ask him again this week, although I would like to have him on again soon.
01:36:03 I kind of like to get snake back on because I thought snake was pretty cool.
01:36:07 You know, yeah, you know, this is, um, here's something that fucked me up.
01:36:12 I was reading some of those.
01:36:13 I don't know if this is insane.
01:36:14 I don't know who's crazy.
01:36:15 One of us is crazy.
01:36:17 Not you or me, me or the person whose article I was reading,
01:36:20 an article about like how to, how to push your game, get your game seen by people.
01:36:25 I think this was specifically in reference to like telling
01:36:29 YouTubers about your game to try and get your game seen by influencers.
01:36:33 This, this article said like, send them, you know, send them a, send them an email.
01:36:40 Don't inundate them, send them an email and then if they don't answer,
01:36:43 maybe send them one or two gentle reminders.
01:36:45 And if they don't answer after that, you know, you should assume that they're just not interested.
01:36:51 Um, but they said like, don't like bother them.
01:36:54 Don't annoy them with like, you know, don't inundate them with emails.
01:36:59 Maybe send one every, you know, don't send more than like one a week or something.
01:37:10 And like, I don't know.
01:37:11 That just seems like to me, one a week seems like really fast.
01:37:19 Really fast?
01:37:20 Yeah, my, my, my, I don't know.
01:37:22 To me, it's like, damn, you only waited a week.
01:37:26 Like, fuck you.
01:37:27 Like, I, like, I don't know.
01:37:29 I would, I guess I just, my timetable would be slower.
01:37:32 I would think like, if I don't want to bother someone, like I wouldn't, I wouldn't,
01:37:36 I wouldn't write them back for like at least a month.
01:37:39 I think would be my instinct.
01:37:41 But I guess it depends on like how, like how big the person is.
01:37:47 If they're like, like physically unable to respond to so many things.
01:37:55 And then like, oh, yes, I was going to get around to that.
01:37:57 And like, they just need our reminder, literal.
01:38:00 Or it could be, if you don't want to bother them, I feel like if, if you post,
01:38:05 like you put an email, they don't read it because they're not interested.
01:38:09 And then you give another email after a week.
01:38:12 Well, then it would feel like too quick.
01:38:15 But I feel like even after a month, like what would be different?
01:38:19 Yeah.
01:38:20 They didn't care about it the first time.
01:38:22 The more I think about it, the more I think that I'm, yeah, that I'm being silly.
01:38:30 Like, like, yeah, why, why wait more than a week?
01:38:34 If you, if you wait a month to follow up and then you wait another month,
01:38:38 they'll just have forgotten about the original email.
01:38:41 Yeah.
01:38:41 If they, you know, assuming they ever saw it in the first place.
01:38:45 So I'm, hmm, I don't know.
01:38:50 You're giving them like time to get around to seeing it.
01:38:54 Yeah.
01:38:55 And a month is like a lot of time.
01:38:57 They would need to be like a super, like they would need to be so big that they wouldn't
01:39:02 really read all of their own emails.
01:39:04 They would have like a secretary.
01:39:07 They're like a million sub-youtuber and they get like a thousand emails a day.
01:39:10 I actually don't know if people send emails these days, but like I assume they still happen.
01:39:15 They do, but like, it's for like, it's like press stuff, press release stuff.
01:39:24 Yeah.
01:39:25 I don't think.
01:39:25 Human beings don't send emails anymore.
01:39:27 I think probably, yeah, probably less.
01:39:30 I think people mess, message each other in various ways, more, more so.
01:39:37 At least young people do.
01:39:40 Okay.
01:39:40 Anyway, let's get the, let's get the voicemails.
01:39:43 Uh, first voicemail of the day is called, uh, niggle me this.
01:39:48 Are you ready?
01:39:50 Yes.
01:39:50 Three, two, one, go.
01:39:53 What is 13 yet 51, Mr. Saint Man?
01:39:58 What is 13 yet 51?
01:40:02 Like 13 years old and 51 kills in Halo.
01:40:11 I don't know what that is from reference to.
01:40:13 What is 13 yet 51?
01:40:17 I have, I have no idea.
01:40:19 Wait, is this a racist thing?
01:40:21 Oh, wait, is this, is this like a, is this like a crime statistics or like a, an IQ distribution thing?
01:40:28 I think this is a racism.
01:40:31 I think, I think we just did a racism.
01:40:35 I like my 13 year old Halo player.
01:40:38 Yeah.
01:40:38 I'll call it a new player better.
01:40:39 I, I genuinely, I don't know what, it's something like that.
01:40:43 I, you know what, I could probably figure it out if I thought about it, but I won't.
01:40:48 Um, next, uh, next one is how's paradise?
01:40:53 Three, two, one, go.
01:40:55 All right.
01:40:56 Funny, dumb racism aside.
01:40:58 How is wrapping up rad con for stuff?
01:41:01 The only reason I ask is cause you know, it's just a little over two years since those faded times
01:41:07 and I haven't tuned in in a while.
01:41:08 So I'm curious.
01:41:10 I feel like I, I feel like I talked about this last week and maybe if you had listened.
01:41:15 Yeah.
01:41:15 I talked about this, uh, Nate is, Nate keeps saying he's going to do,
01:41:20 Nate keeps saying he's going to do the, um, the, the music video.
01:41:25 He said he would do it last month.
01:41:27 He didn't do it.
01:41:28 And then he said, okay, for sure Friday, he didn't do it Friday.
01:41:32 And then he said, okay, I didn't do it for it, but I'll do it for Sunday.
01:41:36 Today is Sunday.
01:41:36 We're recording on Sunday.
01:41:38 So later today, I guess I'll ask him, hey, do it.
01:41:43 I have no doubt he will eventually do it.
01:41:46 Um, anyway, he's got to do, he's got to do that.
01:41:50 And then there's the, the OVA needs to be edited, which, uh, is the biggest thing.
01:41:57 And then I mentioned this before.
01:41:59 I hope this is, no, this is, this is not a, this is not a thing that Kaiju Koon is responsible
01:42:05 for yet because he has not accepted any money.
01:42:08 But I, I hope that if Kaiju Koon gets some time free, he will, uh, take on the job of
01:42:14 finishing the, uh, the dojin, uh, because I don't know who else can do it.
01:42:21 Uh, because the other guy bailed.
01:42:26 The other guy, the other guy fucking, they, they bailed.
01:42:28 They japed us.
01:42:30 They japed, they japed pretty hard.
01:42:33 Anyway, that's, that's the answer.
01:42:35 Um, next one is called T-Bap from Gibby Wibby Cutie Woody at itsthetruth.com.
01:42:42 Three, two, one, go.
01:42:45 Two best buddies, bitch about pirates.
01:42:49 Yeah.
01:42:49 T-Bap, the Ben St. Gibb and take pirate podcast.
01:42:55 That's what I, what did I say last week?
01:42:57 I said, um, two, whatever.
01:43:03 I said something else.
01:43:04 I thought you said something to like the podcast, but like the same.
01:43:08 I, I made, I made a T-Bap joke about a different acronym.
01:43:12 I did.
01:43:12 I don't remember what it was.
01:43:13 And then I said, oh, the deep, the depo cast was my joke from last week.
01:43:19 Cause what?
01:43:20 Why not?
01:43:21 Um, next one is called I found your secret Ben.
01:43:24 Three, two, one, go.
01:43:26 Um, hello, Ben.
01:43:28 Yes.
01:43:28 I know your secret.
01:43:30 I read the flight records.
01:43:33 Ben saying, I know, I know.
01:43:36 I saw you, you and Mr. Epstein quite close.
01:43:41 Or are you not?
01:43:42 I believe that, I believe that, um, your, your brother will want to hear this.
01:43:50 No, don't tell him.
01:43:52 Then he'll, then he'll never finish the music video.
01:43:58 Okay.
01:44:00 You got me.
01:44:00 So such mirth, such glee in those words.
01:44:03 He loved it.
01:44:04 He, he, he won me over honestly.
01:44:07 His enthusiasm for me being on the Epstein flight was just infectious.
01:44:14 Okay.
01:44:14 Next one is called a song.
01:44:16 Three, two, one, go.
01:44:19 Ben saying, I'm going to come to your house.
01:44:29 You better start running.
01:44:34 Okay, I'm running.
01:44:45 That's a good song.
01:44:46 A good song.
01:44:47 Good song.
01:44:48 Uh, intro song?
01:44:50 I don't know.
01:44:50 I don't know if it's quite, I don't know if it's quite at that level.
01:44:53 Um, next one is called congratulations.
01:44:56 Three, two, one, go.
01:44:59 Congratulations on another shit on my desk yearly.
01:45:03 Great.
01:45:05 Yeah.
01:45:06 Yes.
01:45:06 Hit both, hit your, your give and take.
01:45:10 That's right.
01:45:10 That's true.
01:45:11 That's your name.
01:45:12 That's my name.
01:45:22 Uh, yeah.
01:45:22 Um.
01:45:23 Yeah.
01:45:23 Another shit on my desk yearly came out.
01:45:26 It's number six.
01:45:27 How many more of those are there?
01:45:30 I believe there are nine in total.
01:45:34 And that's was what, yeah, number six.
01:45:35 So, wow.
01:45:38 It'll be entertaining us for years to come.
01:45:40 Yep.
01:45:45 Ah, hmm.
01:45:47 I just had a weird sensation in my face and I'm wondering,
01:45:53 am I having a stroke?
01:45:55 Probably.
01:45:58 Okay.
01:45:59 Next one is called Dublin Wild.
01:46:02 Three, two, one, go.
01:46:04 Hi, uh, Ben Gibb, whoever the fuck else is around.
01:46:10 I've been skulking around RFCK for a while and I kind of just
01:46:14 wanted to call in and thank y'all because, uh, slime and
01:46:19 punishment and Lord of Ghosts kind of lit a fire under me to
01:46:24 like start drawing and so I've started drawing and it's all
01:46:29 shit, but it makes me happy.
01:46:31 So, uh, thanks, everyone.
01:46:34 Well, shucks, uh, cool.
01:46:37 That's good.
01:46:40 Good for you.
01:46:41 Keep at it if you like it and, uh, you will certainly, uh, get
01:46:47 better and, uh, that will probably be gratifying and, uh, who
01:46:52 knows what the future may hold.
01:46:54 That's cool.
01:46:57 Okay.
01:46:57 Thank you for the voice.
01:46:58 Wow, a sincere, a sincere voicemail.
01:47:00 That's fucked up.
01:47:01 It is.
01:47:01 Oh, how are we supposed to, what are we supposed to do with
01:47:03 that?
01:47:04 Just say thanks.
01:47:05 That wasn't even a little bit racist.
01:47:06 Not even as a joke.
01:47:08 What?
01:47:09 Okay.
01:47:10 Next one is called Slime and Punishment, Physical
01:47:12 Release and Phantom's Revenge.
01:47:14 Three, two, one, go.
01:47:16 Hey, Ben, what are you going to do about the game when you
01:47:19 release the physical release of Slime and Punishment?
01:47:23 Yeah.
01:47:23 Are you going to do like the Homestuck books did where
01:47:25 they took like screenshots of all their games and like,
01:47:28 but like text underneath explaining stuff?
01:47:31 Or are you just going to have like a big splash page where it
01:47:34 says like, uh, okay.
01:47:36 And then the game happens.
01:47:37 And then go and play my game now.
01:47:40 What are you going to do, Ben?
01:47:41 What are you going to do?
01:47:42 It's a good question.
01:47:43 Mostly I'm just looking forward to reading that index
01:47:46 because there's so much in that comic where I'm just like,
01:47:48 what, what does any of this mean?
01:47:50 I don't even know what, yeah.
01:47:51 The index is going to be a work unto itself.
01:47:55 I haven't even finished like finalizing like the page layout yet.
01:48:00 I think I'm, this week, I think I should actually like pick a
01:48:04 layout, order a sample copy and like get that process underway.
01:48:10 But, uh, yeah.
01:48:12 So for the game, I thought about this and I think what I'm
01:48:15 going to do is the game is basically indispensable to the
01:48:19 comic.
01:48:20 Like the game is like a very important part of the story.
01:48:23 I can't like, I can't just like cut away and be like,
01:48:26 and then go play the game.
01:48:28 So what I think I'm going to do, and I think this will look cool,
01:48:31 I'll think it'll be good, is I will just have,
01:48:34 I will just have a series of screenshots from the game that
01:48:37 just sort of tell the story of the game.
01:48:39 And what I'll do for like dialogue scenes, uh, is I,
01:48:43 when possible, I will just have like, I mean, imagine, for
01:48:48 instance, the, the initial, you know, when Phantom meets the
01:48:50 first Sonichu, right, it'll just be like the screenshot of
01:48:56 him just, they'll just looking at each other.
01:48:58 And then underneath, I will just have the text boxes as
01:49:00 displayed in the game.
01:49:02 And I will just show, like in a, basically, probably just in
01:49:04 like a vertical row, like all the text boxes in sequence of
01:49:08 like, you know, Phantom says this, Sonichu says this,
01:49:11 but, but, but, but, but, but, but, you know, those, I will,
01:49:15 I will use, I will use screenshots as necessary.
01:49:19 And then I will just show text boxes in sequence to show,
01:49:22 like, this is, this is the dialogue.
01:49:25 That, that's my idea.
01:49:26 And I'm gonna mess around with it and see how I can make it work.
01:49:32 That's the plan.
01:49:34 Good question.
01:49:35 Um, I think it'll look pretty cool, honestly.
01:49:38 It'll be, I think it'll work pretty well, actually.
01:49:41 It'll just be like reading a comic, but just, you know,
01:49:44 the panels just look like a video game, but it will be
01:49:47 Yeah.
01:49:48 perfectly comprehensible, I think.
01:49:50 And I'm kind of excited for that, actually.
01:49:53 Um, yeah.
01:49:56 Something I'm not excited for is getting the, the, the video S
01:50:00 revert into a book form, because I feel like it's going to be,
01:50:07 annoying to screenshot the video to get like images for the
01:50:15 book, because the, you know, the, um, I don't know if I'm going to
01:50:19 use the right word for this, but the video is all like, you
01:50:22 know, interpolated.
01:50:24 So like frame by frame, you know, there might be like blur in
01:50:28 between.
01:50:28 Like if something is moving, there might be blur or like, what
01:50:32 do you call it when you kind of see two frames at once as it's
01:50:34 transitioning from one to the other?
01:50:35 I, I don't know.
01:50:36 Well, that's cool.
01:50:37 But yeah, you know that.
01:50:38 Yeah, that.
01:50:38 So, um, I feel like it might result in poor image quality, which
01:50:42 would be have the original, like,
01:50:45 editing file for that.
01:50:47 I have all the assets.
01:50:49 But I would have, God, I mean, I guess I could do it.
01:50:52 It would be a real hassle to like, just take the original assets and
01:50:56 just put them in like, manga studio and just move them around and
01:50:59 compose them into recreations of frames from the video.
01:51:03 I mean, I could do that.
01:51:05 But like, how was it created in the first place?
01:51:08 Do you have like a, an Adobe Premiere file that you could like?
01:51:11 Vegas.
01:51:13 Vegas.
01:51:14 Like, could you not like, just scrum through that and find a frame that
01:51:18 isn't like, interpolated?
01:51:20 Hmm.
01:51:22 And then like, export frame.
01:51:24 Like, that's usually a thing you can do in editing software.
01:51:27 You know, you know what?
01:51:29 Possibly.
01:51:30 Yeah, I might possibly be able to do that.
01:51:33 I, it's, it's a Vegas file.
01:51:34 Vegas is a little bit feature light, but they'll probably,
01:51:37 there's probably a way to do that.
01:51:40 I think so.
01:51:42 That's, that's a good.
01:51:43 It's a good idea.
01:51:44 I didn't, hmm.
01:51:46 Yeah.
01:51:47 I might do that if the, yeah.
01:51:50 All right.
01:51:50 That's an option.
01:51:52 All right.
01:51:53 Next one is called a message for cyber.
01:51:57 Well, it's shell, but it's got an apostrophe between the E and the L.
01:52:00 So I guess it would be cyber shield.
01:52:03 Three, two, one, go.
01:52:05 Cyber shield.
01:52:06 I heard you give me on this week.
01:52:07 I got a very important message for you.
01:52:08 Here, one second.
01:52:09 Let me just do my voice together.
01:52:13 I'm sorry.
01:52:16 He said he would be on soon.
01:52:19 Uh, sorry about that.
01:52:21 Uh, whoops.
01:52:24 Next one is called a daemon Targaryen from the rogue prince at westeros.gov.
01:52:30 Three, two, one, go.
01:52:32 Now, there's a joke that nobody's going to get.
01:52:43 Um, I, yeah, I don't get it.
01:52:46 Uh, uh, press Preston Jacobs in some of his older videos when he was talking
01:52:52 about like Westeros history, he just has a joke where anytime he mentions daemon Targaryen,
01:53:00 he, he refers to, I guess he just thinks daemon Targaryen is a bad ass or the books
01:53:05 just treat daemon Targaryen as a bad ass.
01:53:08 So he, he always, he always refers to him as daemon Targaryen, the rogue prince.
01:53:13 And then he plays that little music sting as like a panning shot up to daemon Targaryen's
01:53:17 face plays.
01:53:20 It's, it's in like one or two of his, his older, uh, series.
01:53:24 So I appreciated that voicemail.
01:53:28 Uh, daemon Targaryen.
01:53:30 The rogue prince.
01:53:33 Uh, next one is called Twilight Roaster.
01:53:36 Three, two, one, go.
01:54:01 I need, what, what's, what would be the, what's the point?
01:54:08 What's the point of, first of all, I mean, if it's always the same number of frames,
01:54:14 then the damage is consistent.
01:54:17 Whoa, the, the, they're tied together.
01:54:22 They're tied together so they don't become dis-coupled from each other, which,
01:54:27 I mean, what if your computer slows down and the frames are different?
01:54:34 Well, if it's, if they're slowed down, it will still render the same number of frames.
01:54:38 We'll just do it slower.
01:54:42 Uh, I guess.
01:54:44 I mean, some, some things that, I know that in some games, things tied to frame rate
01:54:50 mean that if anything affects the frame rate, such as a, uh, like a computer, um,
01:54:56 like being unable to, to run quickly enough, it makes, it changes the gameplay,
01:55:03 not just like visually what's happening.
01:55:06 Well, unless like, unless like Game Maker just like automatically does such a thing,
01:55:12 there's no such feature in Phantom's Revenge.
01:55:17 So it, it shouldn't make a difference.
01:55:21 Uh, it shouldn't, it shouldn't skip any frames or change the,
01:55:25 change the outcome in any significant way.
01:55:29 Uh, I guess I don't know.
01:55:30 It's possible that there's something going on that I'm not aware of.
01:55:34 Uh, I mean,
01:55:39 I mean the, the damage ticker, like, I mean, I don't know, just see,
01:55:44 it just seemed like the easiest way to do it, to make the damage ticker move in real time,
01:55:49 is to just have the damage be dealt in one frame increments and have the timer update
01:55:56 in real time.
01:55:58 The, Ben, you solved the problem one way.
01:56:00 Why didn't you solve the problem other way?
01:56:02 The, shout out.
01:56:04 Fuck you.
01:56:05 Fuck voicemails.
01:56:06 Um, next one is a YouTube video.
01:56:11 I'm gonna look at what the YouTube video is.
01:56:14 It's a three-minute video.
01:56:17 Oh, it's a transistor sound.
01:56:19 Transistor original soundtrack, old friends from Supergiant Games.
01:56:24 Okay, uh, let me just listen to the voicemail.
01:56:26 Three, two, one, go.
01:56:30 Guys, I'm not a big fan of Bash or even Hayes, but you must play Transistor.
01:56:36 The game is super short.
01:56:38 Only six hours long, but the vibes are immaculate.
01:56:41 Immaculate.
01:56:42 If you like the song attached, this will be some of the best six hours of your life.
01:56:46 Also, this game has sword marriage too, wink, wink.
01:56:48 Oh, right.
01:56:50 Very good.
01:56:50 Hmm, you know, I agree that a six hour game is a short game,
01:57:00 but I think of myself playing it, and I'm like, this is not gonna take six hours.
01:57:04 And, uh, I don't even really play games for six hours at a time.
01:57:11 Like, not always, unless I'm really into it.
01:57:14 Uh, I mean, um...
01:57:20 Pfft, duh.
01:57:23 I guess, uh, I guess since I like Hayes so much, I guess I would consider taking a look at Transistor.
01:57:28 Uh, I mean, I would play it.
01:57:30 I'm not against it.
01:57:31 I would, I mean, I definitely play in six hour bursts commonly, so that's not a,
01:57:36 that's not a problem for me.
01:57:37 I might be able to finish it in one sitting.
01:57:40 Um, um, uh, I mean, it's a...
01:57:44 But I'm gonna listen to like two seconds of the, of the...
01:57:51 Game sounds pretty good.
01:57:53 Music sounds pretty good.
01:57:56 I thought of something.
01:57:56 I had a, I had a thought.
01:57:58 This is, let me tell you my funny joke that I thought in my head and didn't tell anyone.
01:58:02 Uh, last, last week I was talking about the music in Hayes, and I said,
01:58:06 there's some kind of, you know, there's that something, something sorta guitar.
01:58:10 And you said, you asked Spanish?
01:58:12 Like, is it Spanish guitar?
01:58:14 And I was thinking about that.
01:58:15 And I, and I, the joke that I wish I had made at the time is what it killed
01:58:21 is I should have said, I don't know a Spanish guitar from a Mexican pizza.
01:58:30 Right? Killer, right?
01:58:31 Uh, I don't get it, but yeah.
01:58:34 Smashing, smashing.
01:58:36 Um, anyway, I might, I might play Transistor.
01:58:39 I might, I might.
01:58:41 Um, I just got a comment.
01:58:44 I just got a comment on my YouTube channel.
01:58:46 This is, this is not a voicemail, but let me read this comment.
01:58:49 I think it's, Brendan J says, Hey Ben, as much as I like this video and the subject matter,
01:58:56 I cannot in good faith subscribe or recommend your content.
01:59:00 Why did you say the N word?
01:59:01 I suspect it is because you were in a space where you, one, felt very comfortable using
01:59:06 this offensive slur, two, knew no one would call you out on your behavior.
01:59:10 You could have just said N word or even F word.
01:59:15 Wait, what?
01:59:17 That's okay.
01:59:18 All right.
01:59:19 Whatever.
01:59:19 Okay.
01:59:19 Anyway, I don't think you're a bad person or regularly engage in shitty behavior like this.
01:59:24 It's just the level of ease you express using these slurs makes me uncomfortable.
01:59:29 Thank you for the laughs.
01:59:31 Uh, I think, okay.
01:59:34 I just, this just popped up on my dash, my desktop and I was like, okay, I want to look at this.
01:59:39 Uh, what do you, what do you think?
01:59:42 Do we kill this guy?
01:59:43 I'm going to kill him.
01:59:44 That's not true.
01:59:45 I'm joking.
01:59:46 I mean, the people are free to decide whether to recommend a person.
01:59:53 So like, I don't know.
01:59:54 Yeah.
01:59:55 This, I will, I agree that this person is right in hindsight.
01:59:59 I could have, I could have just said N word.
02:00:02 And in fact, I kind of think I should, I think I should have, if I were going back,
02:00:05 I think I would just say N word because I'm pretty sure tales gets trolled,
02:00:10 prints it with, I'm not sure if it originally printed it with asterisks,
02:00:14 but like now when you read it, it's got N, like asterisks, asterisks, asterisks,
02:00:19 R, I think.
02:00:21 So they're talking about a specific time.
02:00:23 I don't know if it originally did like sure.
02:00:25 Yeah.
02:00:25 Yeah.
02:00:26 In the, in the tales gets from, because you know, there's the, there's the words of power
02:00:29 that cause you, um, oh, I see that, that kill your enemies and the N word is the ultimate one.
02:00:34 I think it just kills you instantly or it kills your enemy instantly.
02:00:37 It kills yourself instantly if you say the ultimate word of power.
02:00:44 Yeah.
02:00:45 So, you know, I probably should have just said N word honestly.
02:00:49 So I agree on that.
02:00:51 Yeah.
02:00:53 I guess I said it, you know, I was, I feel, I do feel like there's a difference between
02:00:59 saying it, like calling someone it versus like saying, you know,
02:01:03 hey, this is a work of fiction.
02:01:04 And in this work of fiction, you know, this word is a story, what's the word is a story conceit
02:01:11 and like this is the word and this is what it is saying.
02:01:15 I feel like it's different.
02:01:16 So it's, I don't know.
02:01:17 It's different, but like there's no, there's no detriment to putting the N word in place
02:01:22 of it when you're talking about it.
02:01:24 Honestly, there would have been no detriment to just saying N word.
02:01:28 So I guess I kind of agree.
02:01:30 It's not like people are confused about what that means.
02:01:32 Yeah.
02:01:34 I mean, that's my answer to the the ease of express using them.
02:01:39 I wasn't, I don't know.
02:01:40 I don't know if I would say I was using it.
02:01:41 I wasn't using it.
02:01:43 I was saying it.
02:01:44 I was referring to it by its name.
02:01:48 So I sort of, I agree with some of this comment, but not all of its spirit, I guess.
02:01:56 Also, I'm confused by the, you could have just said N word or even F word.
02:02:01 Maybe they mean, maybe you say the F word.
02:02:06 Do I also say the F word?
02:02:08 I don't remember if I say it.
02:02:10 I might.
02:02:11 I mean, it probably comes up.
02:02:12 It's tails gets trolled.
02:02:13 Those trolls are very foul mouthed.
02:02:16 Yeah, probably.
02:02:17 I mean, I guess he's right.
02:02:18 Actually, I guess knuckles and shadow are very foul mouthed.
02:02:21 They're all foul mouthed.
02:02:22 They are.
02:02:23 They say all the words.
02:02:25 I wonder, now I don't know, he might be consistent about this.
02:02:31 I wonder if this person would recommend tails gets trolled,
02:02:34 despite the fact that it contains those words.
02:02:39 I, maybe he wouldn't.
02:02:42 Maybe he'd be like, I can't in good faith recommend tails gets trolled because
02:02:46 of the ease with which they use slurs.
02:02:49 It makes me uncomfortable.
02:02:50 That's possible.
02:02:52 I doubt it, but it's possible.
02:02:54 I mean, it could also just be that they, the people that they would recommend it to
02:02:59 would be taken aback and offended if they heard you say it.
02:03:04 I, it's, it's, it's honestly fair enough.
02:03:06 If you're like the fact that I say that in the, in the video is like,
02:03:10 I can't recommend, I can't show this to anyone.
02:03:13 You know, I get it.
02:03:16 That's one reason why I think if I were doing it again, I wouldn't say it.
02:03:20 I don't feel like it added really anything.
02:03:24 And it, it, and it's, you know,
02:03:26 it's kind of like, it's kind of like how I feel about the Usopp.
02:03:31 Usopp's design, if somebody doesn't like it and finds it offensive, finds it like to be
02:03:37 problematic, a problem affects their enjoyment, they can't recommend one piece because of it.
02:03:42 Like, yeah, that's fair enough.
02:03:44 And I just think, and I think it's a shame that he is designed in a way that makes some
02:03:50 people feel like that.
02:03:51 I think it's unfortunate.
02:03:52 I think it's unfortunate.
02:03:53 And I kind of, for that reason, I kind of wish maybe he had not looked quite like that, perhaps.
02:04:04 But it is what it is.
02:04:06 So, okay.
02:04:07 I guess that's all I have to say about this YouTube comment.
02:04:10 You did.
02:04:11 Okay.
02:04:11 The next one is called, is Tixie still getting a cut of the Radcon for profits?
02:04:17 Since she, from, since she's not a member anymore at gmail.com.
02:04:21 The answer, I think I talked, yeah.
02:04:24 That was one second long, so yeah, that's the question.
02:04:26 Yeah, yeah.
02:04:27 I think there is, I think I talked about this last week.
02:04:30 The answer is yes.
02:04:32 She is still getting a cut because she was involved.
02:04:35 I am, I am getting part of what she would have gotten because she did not follow through on her
02:04:40 stuff, specifically with Road to Radcon.
02:04:43 I would like to take all of it.
02:04:45 I would like to deny her everything, but I can't.
02:04:48 I can't, I don't have any grounds to do that.
02:04:51 I think she deserves less than everyone because she famously worked the least and complained the most.
02:04:58 And then wasted all of her time with the lecture that she decided to trash.
02:05:02 But, I mean, she, she was involved, I guess.
02:05:06 So, it's part of the initial agreement.
02:05:10 She's entitled to a cut.
02:05:11 And that's sad, sad, but true, sad, but true.
02:05:15 Yep.
02:05:15 Rail against the cruel fate.
02:05:20 So, yeah, she will get a cut.
02:05:25 Okay.
02:05:25 Next one is called, does Ben not like Ash Vampire?
02:05:28 If so, why?
02:05:29 Wait, where's that?
02:05:31 If you reload the second page, I think we got another one and it pushed everyone.
02:05:35 All of them down.
02:05:37 Okay.
02:05:38 It's just, it's just the question.
02:05:41 No, I don't like Ash Vampire.
02:05:43 First of all, why do you even know who that is?
02:05:46 Stupid.
02:05:47 Ash Vampire is totally irrelevant.
02:05:50 So, you must, so you must know them personally.
02:05:52 In which case, I feel sorry for you.
02:05:56 Ash Vampire is one, a dummy.
02:05:58 Two, a Nazi.
02:06:01 And that's it.
02:06:02 No, I don't like Ash Vampire.
02:06:04 They went on a, they went on a deranged rant about how George Floyd was just as bad as,
02:06:10 what was the cop's name?
02:06:15 He had a funny name.
02:06:16 It was like Big It or something.
02:06:18 It was like, no, it was-
02:06:20 John Big It.
02:06:21 No, he genuinely, his name was like Chauvin, like Chauvinist.
02:06:26 Oh, yeah, yeah.
02:06:28 Derek Chauvin.
02:06:29 Derek Chauvin.
02:06:32 Ash went on a deranged rant about how George Floyd was actually just as bad as Michael, as Chauvin.
02:06:38 Just as bad for being murdered as the guy that murdered him.
02:06:41 They're actually, they're actually pretty the same when you think about them.
02:06:44 They're just, they're two sides of the same coin.
02:06:46 No, I don't like Ash Vampire.
02:06:47 If you're Ash Vampire's friend, you're an idiot.
02:06:49 And I don't like you either.
02:06:50 And, and I mean that.
02:06:53 Lamal.
02:06:56 Also, Ash Vampire is just a dummy.
02:06:58 And I haven't listened to their Bionicle lecture, but I'm sure it sucks because I have talked to Ash Vampire.
02:07:05 And they're an idiot.
02:07:05 Like they're, they're, I used to talk to them about, they used to be in my Discord server.
02:07:12 And they used to just bore everyone with like, wanting to talk about like the submarine that
02:07:18 they used to work on all the time.
02:07:20 And everyone would like, and everyone would like, talk about them behind their back,
02:07:24 because they would like, talk about how like, they would, they would talk about
02:07:29 stuff that happened, like on their, on the submarine that they were stationed on.
02:07:34 And they would, they would describe like, unfair things that were done to them or like,
02:07:39 things like, oh yeah, you know, they, the rules are like, like the system's designed to fuck you
02:07:43 over, you know, when you do that, and like, it's really obvious that like, they're just an asshole
02:07:47 and nobody likes them.
02:07:48 And that's why like, people were like, that's why they were, they would get in trouble for
02:07:53 things that other people didn't get in trouble for, like, like vaping on the submarine.
02:07:56 They were like, oh, you know, they just, you know, they just had it out for me,
02:07:59 because of my controversial opinions or whatever.
02:08:02 But they were obviously just an asshole that nobody likes and like, vaping on the submarine.
02:08:06 Yeah, other people got away with it, and they didn't get away with it.
02:08:09 They got discharged for it.
02:08:11 The reason is just because nobody likes you, because you're just a dick.
02:08:14 And that's, and that's it.
02:08:15 So no, I don't like Ash Vampire.
02:08:16 Good, good question.
02:08:17 Great question.
02:08:22 Do you have anything to say about that?
02:08:24 I mean, I agree that they don't seem like a nice person because of the George Floyd thing.
02:08:29 I do remember reading, I think it was in like May's discord when she had that,
02:08:34 or maybe she still does.
02:08:35 She wrote it in text in the May's discord, and then on their stream, she read it out loud.
02:08:43 She read it out loud in a stream with Glink, and May and Glink were like,
02:08:47 yeah, very interesting.
02:08:48 Yeah, sounds good.
02:08:51 Yeah, so I have no reason to defend them at all.
02:08:56 I don't really care about them.
02:08:57 I hate them.
02:08:58 I hate them.
02:09:00 And then that was the time.
02:09:02 That was the time, and I'll just briefly remind everyone, that was the time that,
02:09:09 in response, I went ballistic.
02:09:13 I went ballistic in the call on the stream, called them all.
02:09:19 I genuinely, I don't even remember what I called them.
02:09:23 I condemn them in the strongest possible terms.
02:09:25 And then immediately afterwards, Trixie DMed me to say,
02:09:30 Ben, you're just mad that you don't get to fuck May like I do.
02:09:33 You're just mad.
02:09:34 You're just mad and you need to have sex like me.
02:09:39 It's a famous interaction.
02:09:40 A famous interaction.
02:09:42 I mean, it's famous to me.
02:09:49 The moment when I think I knew that actually, Trixie's not a good person.
02:09:53 Maybe I don't like them.
02:09:55 Anyway, next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder.
02:09:59 Play Deltarune Chapter 2.
02:10:01 No!
02:10:04 I will eventually.
02:10:05 Maybe when Chapter 3 comes out, I'll finally play Chapter 2.
02:10:10 You won't comb through Chapter 2 enough.
02:10:14 Or I still got to go back and fight Jevil.
02:10:16 I never fought Jevil in Chapter 1.
02:10:18 No!
02:10:19 Yeah.
02:10:19 I mean, Jevil's really difficult.
02:10:22 He's really difficult, but I like, I like games.
02:10:25 That are hard.
02:10:26 I like, I like a, I like games that are hard.
02:10:29 Like Demon's Souls, Demon's Souls.
02:10:34 What's the devil may cry about part?
02:10:37 No, wait, what was he?
02:10:38 I forget the lyrics there.
02:10:40 I don't remember that many of the lyrics.
02:10:42 I like games that are hard.
02:10:44 Like part one and three.
02:10:47 Two is easy and it sucks.
02:10:50 I like games that are tough.
02:10:52 Right.
02:10:53 Forget what game he was talking about though.
02:10:54 It was Devil May Cry for sure.
02:10:56 Yeah.
02:10:57 Yeah, for sure.
02:10:58 Devil May Cry 2 sucks.
02:11:00 Famously, everybody knows this.
02:11:02 Yeah.
02:11:03 I, I played Devil May Cry 1 at my friend's house and I loved it.
02:11:06 And then Devil May Cry 2 came out and I rented it.
02:11:08 And I was like, hell yeah, Devil May Cry 2.
02:11:10 And then I played it and I was like, this sucks.
02:11:13 And then I never played a Devil May Cry game again.
02:11:16 But then every other Devil May Cry, I was like fine and good.
02:11:19 That's not true.
02:11:19 I think I did play some of 4 and it was, and it was good.
02:11:22 But they're just, they're just not my, they're not really my favorite.
02:11:26 Character action games are not really my like thing and that's fine.
02:11:31 Things that are tough is too tough for me.
02:11:36 You beat Phantom's Revenge.
02:11:38 It's kind of hard.
02:11:40 That was a thinking game though.
02:11:41 I like thinking games.
02:11:42 I don't like like stress inducing like reaction time games because it's using my muscles and
02:11:51 I don't have any of those.
02:11:54 I see.
02:11:56 My brain's real big but my body is a skeleton.
02:11:59 There's nothing there.
02:12:00 That's, you gotta play to your strengths I guess.
02:12:05 Next one is called, no, Twitter Sparkle.
02:12:09 Three, two, one, go.
02:12:12 Do you get those people on Twitter?
02:12:14 You know those people that go around saying that depicting everything in media is bad.
02:12:20 No toxic relationships.
02:12:22 No crimes.
02:12:23 No enemy balloons.
02:12:24 And especially, no rule 34 of anything.
02:12:28 That isn't an adult human being.
02:12:30 They even came after those bloody gory MLP cartoons.
02:12:33 Where do they all even come from?
02:12:35 God, I miss Newgrounds.
02:12:39 Twilight, I mean Twitter Sparkle, Newgrounds still exists.
02:12:45 It does still exist.
02:12:46 In fact, it's like it's had a like a resurgence a bit recently.
02:12:53 The clock gang is still posting.
02:12:57 What's up with those clocks?
02:12:58 I never really clicked on any of those.
02:13:00 I was just like why are the clocks of everything?
02:13:02 They were just a group of animators who just kind of had like they were sort of a gang who all kind of
02:13:11 themed their animations similarly.
02:13:15 Damn, that must have been the life.
02:13:17 That's exactly what I want.
02:13:20 Is to just be in a fucking art gang, making a splash in a scene.
02:13:25 It's all I want in life.
02:13:27 And I've been cruelly denied it.
02:13:30 What do you have to say for yourself?
02:13:33 I mean, wow.
02:13:36 Defend yourself now.
02:13:38 Well, I mean, we could start an art gang.
02:13:43 I'm doing things.
02:13:45 Yeah, I just, I mean, yeah.
02:13:49 I mean, what constitutes a gang?
02:13:51 I don't know.
02:13:52 Do we need more people doing it?
02:13:55 That's a good question, honestly.
02:13:56 I don't know.
02:13:58 I don't, I can't answer.
02:14:04 I can't answer.
02:14:05 I'm sorry.
02:14:06 I don't have one.
02:14:08 But it's something to think about.
02:14:11 Okay, but we'll be a gang.
02:14:12 We'll be a gang.
02:14:13 Yeah.
02:14:13 Well, what makes a gang is we have to like wear headbands and like go around with like
02:14:18 bats with nails and then like bash and stuff.
02:14:21 And then, and we got to go and we got to snap our fingers and go and like break into song
02:14:27 when a rival gang shows up on our turf.
02:14:30 Oh, yeah.
02:14:31 Those are the two criteria.
02:14:34 And we're, I was thinking more of like an Italian mobster gang.
02:14:38 Like violin cases.
02:14:39 That's also, you know, fine.
02:14:41 That's, that's cool too, I guess.
02:14:46 Next one is called Cyborg Ben Saint Sextal.
02:14:50 Three, two, one, go.
02:14:58 Yeah, this sounds like me.
02:15:04 Thanks.
02:15:05 Have a great day.
02:15:06 Taru.
02:15:09 What the fuck is that?
02:15:11 It's your favorite musketch phrase.
02:15:13 Haru.
02:15:15 Taru.
02:15:15 Taru.
02:15:17 Oh, true.
02:15:17 56709.
02:15:20 Oh, Taru.
02:15:23 Taru.
02:15:25 56709.
02:15:29 You know that, you know the 56709?
02:15:31 Of course I know.
02:15:31 Okay.
02:15:32 Awoo, 56709.
02:15:33 Okay, okay, okay.
02:15:34 Yeah, yeah, of course.
02:15:36 Um, next one is called We've All Thought It.
02:15:40 Three, two, one, go.
02:15:42 Do you ever, like, look at someone and think,
02:15:45 how the fuck were you the winning sperm?
02:15:48 Sure.
02:15:50 I look at myself in the mirror like that.
02:15:54 There you go.
02:15:56 I don't know.
02:15:57 I don't really think of sperm when I look at a person.
02:16:01 It's not the first thing I think of, sure.
02:16:04 Okay.
02:16:05 Anyway, next one is a...
02:16:07 All right, well, there's an Imgur album link.
02:16:10 So let me check that out real quick.
02:16:12 Oh, okay.
02:16:14 I clicked on that.
02:16:15 Wait, wait, it says voicemail is unrelated,
02:16:17 so react to this first, please.
02:16:20 Okay.
02:16:24 Getting people to play just your game to catch all the bugs.
02:16:27 You fucking lizard replay the entire game now, you loser.
02:16:35 New fucking lizard.
02:16:42 I mean, I mean, it's just, yeah, it's that's,
02:16:44 I was just going to say it's just true.
02:16:47 It's true.
02:16:47 It's funny because it's true.
02:16:48 Why would you get people to play test it?
02:16:50 When they could, when they could play like...
02:16:55 You just put a lizard in.
02:16:56 Just put a lizard in.
02:16:57 Just put a lizard in, and there you go.
02:17:00 Free play test.
02:17:01 I get that the implication might be that if I'm going to make versions,
02:17:10 I should have a beta on Alpha.
02:17:12 I think we will eventually do that.
02:17:17 If we make a Kickstarter, there'll be an Alpha where people can access it
02:17:21 before the full game is out.
02:17:22 But for the demo, we only wanted to make one other patch to solve some things.
02:17:27 It's not an ongoing thing.
02:17:28 But I agree, emphatically, with this meme template.
02:17:35 And I will download it and use it.
02:17:38 Thank you for that.
02:17:39 Actually, yeah, this is, this is good.
02:17:42 This is, this is, this is reusable.
02:17:45 It's very funny.
02:17:48 Okay.
02:17:48 Well, the voicemail is called, it's rant about voicefakes at twitter.com.
02:17:55 Three, two, one, go.
02:17:57 Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a good voice to fake?
02:18:01 This is my third.
02:18:02 Actually, now it's fifth.
02:18:04 Account on play.ht, fakeu.com is pretty great and free,
02:18:08 but it doesn't understand punctuation at all.
02:18:11 I have to break sentences into tiniest chunks,
02:18:13 thinking like characters I am using would.
02:18:16 And even then I have to retime it all in audacity to make it sound natural.
02:18:20 And when character doesn't know a word or its acronym or a number,
02:18:23 I have to use other words and splice them together.
02:18:26 Trial period has expired again.
02:18:28 Oh, and those nostalgic critic and linkara voice banks.
02:18:32 No way, nostalgic critic never said katana or anime.
02:18:36 But somehow it understood.
02:18:37 Sonichu.
02:18:38 Understood.
02:18:39 Why you want the fuck?
02:18:40 What's supernatural?
02:18:41 Not a single voice bank there has the word.
02:18:44 Anime.
02:18:44 I'll just put Google translate voicemail next time.
02:18:47 Cause fuck that.
02:18:49 P.S.
02:18:49 Wanna hear something funny?
02:18:51 Here you go.
02:18:52 One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.
02:18:56 One, one, one, one.
02:18:58 One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.
02:19:04 That was pretty funny.
02:19:05 Yeah I like that.
02:19:10 That the computer interprets a sentence
02:19:12 filled with ones would go in that direction specifically is amusing.
02:19:17 What do you mean by that direction?
02:19:19 Well, you know, the pitch would change, you go one, one, one, one, one, like, and speed
02:19:25 up.
02:19:26 It makes me wonder.
02:19:27 And then it would settle into a loop at the end.
02:19:29 Like, why does it think that a sentence like that should go that way?
02:19:33 It's like, it's...
02:19:34 Yeah.
02:19:35 I did wonder, like, why are some of them at different pitches and stuff, like, how does
02:19:41 it...
02:19:42 Like, oh, people talk like this at the beginning of a sentence, they have a horizon, like, I
02:19:47 noticed in some AI things, if you put a question mark at the end, it'll read it all, and then
02:19:54 it'll, like, have the upward lilt of, like, a question voice in there, like, not just
02:20:04 at the end, like, the way people ask questions is, like, kind of specific.
02:20:10 Sure.
02:20:11 My fucking superintendent, or whatever you call him, is, like, bellowing at my fucking
02:20:15 window over my house again.
02:20:20 I hope that's not picking...
02:20:22 I hope that's not picking up on my microphone.
02:20:24 I guess I do not hear anything.
02:20:27 I mean, I can faintly hear it.
02:20:30 What is he...
02:20:32 He's always yelling.
02:20:33 He's always yelling about shit.
02:20:34 He doesn't know how to leave a voicemail, so he just wastes it while we're recording
02:20:39 and then screams it.
02:20:42 Next voicemail is called...
02:20:43 Oh, okay.
02:20:44 There's no voicemail.
02:20:45 It's a second long.
02:20:46 There's a link.
02:20:47 I'm going to follow that link.
02:20:50 Voices.com slash blogs slash how to submit a podcast.
02:20:54 Okay, right.
02:20:55 It's because I didn't like hearing that one voicemail where you explain something, something
02:21:00 or other.
02:21:01 No, Tom actually got back to me.
02:21:03 Tom actually got back to me with a...
02:21:06 What I was hoping wouldn't happen, but Tom got back to me with an explanation of how to
02:21:09 do it.
02:21:10 So he said he might do it, but the fact that he explained it to me makes me think like
02:21:16 I'm probably just going to have to do it for now on.
02:21:19 Okay, whatever.
02:21:20 How to submit a podcast?
02:21:21 Whatever.
02:21:22 Okay, next one is called Please 3, 2, 1, go.
02:21:26 Thank you, please with the broadcast on Spotify.
02:21:29 I'm going to fucking kill you.
02:21:31 Probably I will do that, only because Tom finally...
02:21:34 I'll have to figure it out.
02:21:36 I mean, he's gave me an explanation and it was really long.
02:21:40 He sent me like several paragraphs, like, well, it was split into lines, but it was at
02:21:43 least like 20 plus lines.
02:21:46 So like there's steps involved and I don't want to do it.
02:21:51 I don't want to learn how to do it, but I guess maybe I will.
02:21:57 Next one is called Fan Theory on Tom, 3, 2, 1, go.
02:22:02 Fan Theory on Tom.
02:22:04 He moved to Virginia because it was where Nate is and he was thinking that Trixie's
02:22:08 there too.
02:22:09 Well, is that where she lives now?
02:22:11 But anyways, I know Nate lives there now, so, right?
02:22:14 Yes.
02:22:15 I don't know.
02:22:16 Both of them, right?
02:22:17 I'm not fucking...
02:22:18 You're definitely wrong that that is why he moved there, but you are right that Nate
02:22:23 does move there.
02:22:24 Trixie also lives there.
02:22:27 So I mean...
02:22:28 I don't know.
02:22:30 Any day now, PCPHQ.
02:22:33 Yeah, three of them.
02:22:38 I don't know.
02:22:41 I don't think...
02:22:43 I don't know exactly where Trixie lives.
02:22:44 I don't think she's like that close to Virginia Beach.
02:22:47 Nate is in or around Virginia Beach and Tom, I don't know where in Virginia he lives.
02:22:54 So I don't actually know how close Tom could be like way out in like the boonies part of
02:22:59 Virginia, perhaps.
02:23:01 I mean, it's all boonies, honestly.
02:23:06 But it would be really funny.
02:23:08 It would be really funny to see like Tom in like a Trixie vlog one of these days.
02:23:15 After all, she's done.
02:23:18 I mean, she didn't do anything to him.
02:23:20 I guess so.
02:23:21 Well, she sort of dropped Iron Games or like wasn't...
02:23:26 I guess it's not really that much.
02:23:28 Yeah.
02:23:29 He seemed a bit like maybe not even offended or maybe not even hurt, but like at least
02:23:36 confused that like she didn't even mention Iron Games in that one time.
02:23:41 But like, I don't know.
02:23:43 I don't really know how Tom feels about anything.
02:23:48 So I don't...
02:23:49 I just...
02:23:50 I don't know.
02:23:51 I guess it would be...
02:23:52 I would be surprised.
02:23:54 I would be surprised to see Tom in any like Trixie thing.
02:23:58 But I guess I wouldn't consider it like impossible.
02:24:02 I wouldn't like it, obviously.
02:24:04 But like all kinds of things I don't like happen and that's just like...
02:24:14 Next one is...
02:24:15 Yeah.
02:24:16 Yeah.
02:24:17 Yeah.
02:24:18 Yeah.
02:24:19 Yeah.
02:24:20 It is kind of funny.
02:24:21 Like, yeah, they all live in Virginia.
02:24:24 I don't know if they talk at all anymore, any of them.
02:24:30 So maybe they'll just live in around there and just not have anything to do with each
02:24:37 other.
02:24:38 I don't know.
02:24:39 I don't know.
02:24:40 I just don't know.
02:24:41 Next one is called More Buffalo Bill, please.
02:24:44 Three, two, one, go.
02:24:46 Okay, that's it.
02:24:48 I don't know what you're talking about.
02:24:51 Wasn't that a voicemail I called Buffalo Bill?
02:24:54 Oh, there was.
02:24:56 Yeah.
02:24:57 Yeah, why are you asking us?
02:24:59 I mean, I guess they're just getting the word out.
02:25:02 Yes.
02:25:03 Okay.
02:25:04 Now I remember.
02:25:05 Now I remember.
02:25:06 Next one is a YouTube link.
02:25:08 The video...
02:25:10 That's about the best video game.
02:25:12 Wait, wait, wait.
02:25:13 Okay.
02:25:14 Next one is another, is a link to a soundtrack piece from the other Supergiant game, Pyre.
02:25:22 So I wonder if this is the same voicemail.
02:25:24 Anyway, yeah, it's called Gushing About the Best Video Game.
02:25:27 Three, two, one, go.
02:25:29 You brought up Pyre by Supergiant Games on the last podcast, and holy shit.
02:25:32 No.
02:25:33 Pyre is so fucking good, and people need to play it, actually.
02:25:35 So, like, the objective is to play Magic Basketball to free your party members from
02:25:38 exile.
02:25:39 Success means you have to periodically get rid of your highest level characters, so you
02:25:42 have to play and you're leveling around that.
02:25:43 But if you lose, you don't get to try again.
02:25:45 You just keep going, and one of the other teams gets to be freed from exile instead.
02:25:48 A lot of the time, these teams are really great, too, so you might even want to intentionally
02:25:52 throw some of your matches for their sake.
02:25:54 As a result, the narrative is focused more on the modular storylines of each character
02:25:57 and how they interact with each other.
02:25:59 And in the end, you can read about every single ally and enemy to see where they ended up
02:26:02 in their relationships with the other characters.
02:26:04 There's this huge net of interactions that can be wildly different depending on how you
02:26:07 play, and it's so fucking good.
02:26:09 This is also not mentioning that the soundtrack is God-tier.
02:26:12 Never to return, and especially in the flame are probably my favorite songs from any of
02:26:16 the Supergiant games.
02:26:19 Yeah, I watched a video about all the Supergiant games, and Pyre seems very weird, but that
02:26:26 guy...
02:26:27 I don't remember who it was, honestly, but he really liked Pyre, and it seems interesting.
02:26:32 And it's just really funny that we had another voicemailer send in a YouTube link to a transistor
02:26:38 game, being like, I haven't played Pyre, but you gotta play transistor.
02:26:42 And this person is like, you gotta play Pyre.
02:26:47 Here's another YouTube video about how the music is good.
02:26:53 I guess I might give him a shot.
02:26:56 Maybe.
02:26:57 I'm still working on Hades.
02:27:00 I think what I'm working on now is boosting all my relationships with all the characters,
02:27:09 because I think that's gonna unlock post-game stories content, so I'm working on that.
02:27:19 Okay, next.
02:27:20 I got the credits now.
02:27:23 You beat the game, but that's not the end.
02:27:27 There's more to do after you beat it, until you have to beat it in certain ways to get
02:27:32 the ending, which is the credits, but then there's still more stuff after the credits,
02:27:37 so that's where I'm at right now.
02:27:40 Next one is called Nikolai for Voice Grail, please at gmail.com.
02:27:47 I mean, he did die.
02:27:50 He did die, but dying doesn't mean Voice Grail.
02:27:55 Necessarily.
02:27:56 I don't know.
02:27:57 I don't know.
02:27:58 Do we feel that Nikolai made substantial contributions to the PCP culture?
02:28:04 I feel like Nikolai was alright.
02:28:07 I don't think he's Voice Grail.
02:28:09 Yeah, I don't know if he's Voice Grail.
02:28:11 I'm sorry, Nikolai.
02:28:12 Rest in peace.
02:28:14 Rest in peace in hell, because you're not getting the Voice Grail, buddy.
02:28:22 Next one is called, I know how much Cybershell likes these, 3, 2, 1, go.
02:28:35 I'm so sorry, but Cybershell is not present at the moment, but I will pass along your
02:28:40 message for him.
02:28:41 Go forward these.
02:28:42 Yeah, to his agent.
02:28:45 Next one is called Ben Stop Listening, 3, 2, 1, go.
02:28:51 I heard it in your voice last week.
02:28:55 You want to talk about the one piece stuff.
02:28:58 So without spoiling, what are your feelings?
02:29:03 Are you in the, this is cool camp.
02:29:05 Are you in the wait and see what Oda does camp?
02:29:08 Are you loving it?
02:29:12 Are you bad and wrong?
02:29:14 I don't think you're bad and wrong, but you could be.
02:29:17 But yeah, don't spoil it for Ben.
02:29:20 He'll never, he'll never expect Sanji's giant dildo foot.
02:29:27 I have been, I have been not fully spoiled, but I know something about what has been,
02:29:33 what has transpired.
02:29:36 What do you know?
02:29:38 I know, okay, what I think I know is that something has been revealed about the gum
02:29:44 gum fruit that has changed, like the gum gum fruit has some capability that is,
02:29:54 that has like changed everything seems is what I'm picking up from the, what,
02:29:59 of the discourse I've heard.
02:30:01 It's something like that.
02:30:03 Yeah.
02:30:04 Okay.
02:30:05 Personally, I, this is the sort of thing I would have loved to talk about on the
02:30:10 podcast, but like, I don't have like that anymore.
02:30:14 Yeah.
02:30:15 And it feels, I don't really care.
02:30:17 You're not, you're not, you're not part of the gang.
02:30:19 Not part of the gang.
02:30:20 You're not, you're not part of the cool art gang.
02:30:22 You're not part of the scene.
02:30:23 You're not making waves in the scene anymore.
02:30:24 I'm sorry.
02:30:25 You just can't have it.
02:30:26 That's how I feel.
02:30:27 That's how I feel all the time.
02:30:29 Welcome to my dark twisted mind.
02:30:33 All right.
02:30:34 So without spoiling too much of anything, I find that it's, it's, I can see that it
02:30:44 came to this point.
02:30:47 And I, and people say that it's like, Oh, to plant it, just look at this, just look
02:30:52 at that.
02:30:53 And I'm like, cool.
02:30:54 I think it was a bad plan.
02:30:56 And it undermines a lot of themes that of the whole thing.
02:31:02 But I don't know exactly where they're going with it.
02:31:05 It's just the way it was revealed.
02:31:07 It does not leave a lot to the imagination.
02:31:10 And I, I don't like what I saw.
02:31:14 I'm not that into it.
02:31:16 Sounds like this guy would call you, sorry, this individual whose gender I am not aware
02:31:21 of trying to be any, whatever.
02:31:24 This, this, this person thinks you, you're bad and wrong.
02:31:30 I mean, maybe I am, but like, I, I'm not like seething and like, if this was on a podcast,
02:31:39 I imagine Nate would be screaming and I would be like agreeing, but not screaming along
02:31:45 with him.
02:31:46 It's, it's one of those like, I, I, I don't like, there's parts about it.
02:31:54 I like, like the visuals, like the, the, the sort of like, it's, it's, um, I mean, it's,
02:32:06 it's a problem that I've had for a while.
02:32:11 Ever since, um, like the, it was sort of shifting like the importance of Luffy as a person.
02:32:22 Like he was already always kind of important because he had like very powerful and notorious
02:32:29 relatives.
02:32:30 Yeah.
02:32:31 Um, but like he himself, uh, is just like, he was a kid who ate a fruit.
02:32:37 Yeah.
02:32:38 And then like out of happenstance and then was like, had a, like a rough childhood fighting
02:32:44 and wanted to become a pirate.
02:32:46 And it's like, that's his journey of his, his like journey of just trying to be a pirate.
02:32:51 I mean, not even, and now it's becoming, yeah, it's becoming a bit more like, and it was always
02:32:57 meant to be.
02:32:58 And I'm like, not, not even about this, the latest relation revelation, which I'm not even aware
02:33:03 of, but like other things, like the fact that his, his dad is like the, yeah, his dad is
02:33:09 the leader of the like revolution and like his brother is, is this captain of the, or
02:33:15 you know, the first mate of the shanks crew and, uh, you know, he's got.
02:33:20 The white bear pirates, the, the, that's what I meant.
02:33:23 Um, and, uh, he's like, yeah, he's got all these powerful relatives and like Sanji's
02:33:28 got this, like his dad is like king of the whatever.
02:33:31 Yeah.
02:33:32 I hate, I, I think I have the same feeling about that stuff.
02:33:37 It's like, why has he got it?
02:33:38 It's like the, I haven't watched the new Star Wars, but like how they made Ray like, oh
02:33:42 yeah.
02:33:43 Palpatine sir grandpa.
02:33:44 Yeah.
02:33:45 It's like, why?
02:33:46 It, it couldn't possibly be a story about a person who just is exceptional for their
02:33:53 own.
02:33:54 Yeah.
02:33:55 From, from themselves.
02:33:56 Yeah.
02:33:57 I mean, I think of like a really good protagonist, which everyone agrees with is guts from berserk.
02:34:01 Yeah.
02:34:02 Like he's overwhelmingly strong, but that's because he was fighting since he was like,
02:34:07 like 10.
02:34:08 And like he's had a really tough life constantly fighting in bandit wars.
02:34:15 And then like, you know, fighting, fighting with like sell swords until he was a young
02:34:22 adult and then fighting with the band of the hawk through his whole, you know, into adult
02:34:26 life.
02:34:27 And then after like the big thing happened, he was fighting like demons and and he's fueled
02:34:33 by rage and hate and it's like, he wasn't anyone special.
02:34:38 Yeah.
02:34:39 Like he was just some kid who got roped into this stuff and it's like, it could have happened
02:34:44 to a different person and it's like, the more time, the more times the agency is taken
02:34:51 away from the protagonist and put onto a special advantage that they had the whole time, the
02:34:57 less I can relate to that protagonist, the less I can really feel like I'm rooting for
02:35:02 them.
02:35:03 It's not that I don't root for Luffy anymore.
02:35:04 It's not like that drastic.
02:35:05 It's not like the end of like my enjoyment of one piece, but it is a bit of like a like
02:35:10 a it's one of those sorts of feelings.
02:35:17 I mean, I think I said this about my hero academia when I thought I thought the initial
02:35:24 premise was interesting and then I found out because it was like, oh, a guy with no powers
02:35:28 in a world of people with powers and then it's like, oh, well, actually, no, he just
02:35:31 he kind of gets the best power actually.
02:35:34 It's like, okay, that's fine.
02:35:36 All right, that's fine.
02:35:37 I'm not interested anymore.
02:35:39 The best character in Naruto was Rock Lee, because it was really compelling.
02:35:43 It was really compelling that he's this everyone else has all these fucking is these fucking
02:35:48 wizards who have these like magic spells and like his thing is like, he just he doesn't
02:35:54 have any spells.
02:35:55 He doesn't have any fucking super magic.
02:35:57 All he does is like, he just trained really hard and he's really strong and tough and
02:36:01 he knows what he's doing and he's just he just makes it work.
02:36:05 He just makes it work like that.
02:36:07 It's more compelling.
02:36:09 It is.
02:36:10 It is compelling.
02:36:11 There's a part near the end where like, there's a very dangerous fight going on and Rock Lee
02:36:15 has to like, open like the gates like the and he opens too many is like putting himself
02:36:21 at risk.
02:36:22 Yeah, sort of like, yeah, the unfortunate reality of him not being a main character that like
02:36:27 he can't rise to the heights that Naruto can rise.
02:36:32 Yeah.
02:36:33 Even if he tries his hardest, but he will still try his hardest anyway.
02:36:36 And I think he wins that fight with the help of guy.
02:36:39 I can't remember exactly what was I going on.
02:36:41 I remember him opening the Chakra gates.
02:36:43 I did see that part.
02:36:44 Yeah.
02:36:45 And it's like, despite everything, despite all of his hard work, he cannot be main character.
02:36:51 Yeah.
02:36:52 And it's sad, but it's like, it's cool that he still has a mystic viewpoint on that and
02:36:59 he's like, he's going to try his best.
02:37:00 It's sad, but like you can I mean, he's still at the end of the day.
02:37:04 You can look it's like, well, he's still accomplished a lot.
02:37:06 Like it's still like incredible how far he made it.
02:37:09 Yeah.
02:37:10 And it's like, wow, I love broccoli.
02:37:12 He's so cool.
02:37:13 He's so great.
02:37:14 But yeah, and that's the sort of the thing you I feel like this is true for a lot of
02:37:18 media where like the main characters, the chosen one and blah, blah, blah, whatever, they've
02:37:24 got the main character syndrome where they're just sort of uninteresting.
02:37:27 You kind of know what's going on with them and then you get you fall in love with like
02:37:30 the side character or like the anti hero or someone else.
02:37:34 They're your favorite.
02:37:35 You know what was really, you know, it was a really great twist, though.
02:37:39 I complained a second ago about like Sanji's Sanji being sort of an important guy for
02:37:44 an important family.
02:37:45 I really liked though that he's like, you know, he's from this, he's from this, this
02:37:50 litter of like clone experiment children that all are like superhumans.
02:37:56 But he's like the one failure that like didn't get superhuman power, but he just like is strong
02:38:03 anyway.
02:38:04 Cause you know, it's like cause like cause one piece rules just, I don't know, Oda used
02:38:10 to say stuff in SPS is this is like in one piece, just if you have a strong will, it
02:38:13 just makes you strong.
02:38:15 And just these characters just have so much will to accomplish their dreams that they just
02:38:19 are powerful.
02:38:20 And it's like, yeah, you know what, that's that's all of the explanation I need for why
02:38:25 a character is powerful and strong and accomplishes what they're set out to do.
02:38:29 They just wanted that.
02:38:32 I mean, that's, I mean, that gets you, that gets you most of the way there.
02:38:36 No, no, no.
02:38:37 I mean, I agree.
02:38:38 But like, uh, wait, it doesn't matter.
02:38:44 Don't worry about it.
02:38:45 I can't tell if you're being like sarcastic and being coy because I don't want to spoil
02:38:50 anything.
02:38:51 Anything about one piece?
02:38:54 Yeah.
02:38:55 I, okay, okay.
02:38:58 You know what?
02:39:01 I am curious.
02:39:02 I am pretty curious what everyone's talking about with his latest something or other.
02:39:07 In the grandest scheme of things, um, it's not like a deal breaker.
02:39:12 Like I said, it's not going to make me stop reading.
02:39:16 Sure.
02:39:17 Um, I'm sure it's still going to be like my favorite manga ever.
02:39:21 Yeah.
02:39:22 It's just like the further they push the whole like chosen one angle, the least the
02:39:29 less I enjoy seeing what happens.
02:39:33 Yeah.
02:39:34 I feel you.
02:39:35 I feel you.
02:39:36 The less viscerally I feel this, the, the triumphs, even though I know like he's doing
02:39:42 his best.
02:39:43 Yeah.
02:39:44 Uh, the, that was that voice man.
02:39:52 I agree.
02:39:53 Okay.
02:39:54 Okay.
02:39:55 Yeah.
02:39:56 Um, all right.
02:39:57 We've got, okay.
02:39:58 We've got one more.
02:39:59 All right.
02:40:00 Next one is slime times weekend update 5.0.
02:40:04 Here we go.
02:40:05 Uh, three, two, one, go.
02:40:08 Hello gangsters and gangsters.
02:40:11 Welcome back to the slime times weekend update.
02:40:13 Gangsta.
02:40:14 This installment leaves your dear reporter with some based news and some difficult news.
02:40:19 Last week was a week of changing alliances while this week culminated in slightly more
02:40:23 sobering events since there's much to report on.
02:40:27 And this is also a bit of a catch up job for last week.
02:40:29 I'll be separating this new segment into two parts.
02:40:33 Last week, rowdy loom, a robot girl switched over to killers while mischief, a humanoid
02:40:37 rabbit switched from killers to rowdies.
02:40:40 This was dubbed a cultural exchange program, though either gangsta may decide to stay with
02:40:45 their new posse if they find it just too cozy.
02:40:48 In addition, killer Angon managed to trick Matt into pardoning himself while trying to
02:40:53 pardon another player.
02:40:55 Simply bereft of his rowdy affiliation, Matt quickly proceeded to don his best purple flannel
02:41:00 and take a nice little picture.
02:41:02 Finally, last week, the rowdy territory control party known as Kappa Palooza took place, as
02:41:08 organized by Soba, during which rowdies blasted music, shouted like idiots at each other,
02:41:13 and turned the entire map pink.
02:41:16 Ha!
02:41:17 Uh, based?
02:41:18 I mean, I shouldn't celebrate something like that.
02:41:24 That's pretty base.
02:41:25 It's kind of base, though.
02:41:26 It sounds like fun.
02:41:27 Uh, alright, well, there's the second part.
02:41:29 Slime times weekend update 5.1.
02:41:31 Uh, 3, 2, 1, go.
02:41:34 Part 2.
02:41:35 This week, the curator of the Nalakakaw Museum decided to hold a celebration in the saloon
02:41:40 and drop some archeological hints.
02:41:43 As a result, a new area outside the city was discovered.
02:41:46 The darkened dank caverns which harbored the Ark of the Sludgeonant, another relic of yore.
02:41:52 These were the ones to solve the riddle and open the cave, but due to the obstruction of
02:41:56 a gameplay bug, the killers ended up catching up with the thrashing explorers and were able
02:42:01 to take the artifact for themselves.
02:42:04 Unfortunately, the frustration of this event proved too much for a few rowdies, and they
02:42:08 decided to take a break from the gang warfare.
02:42:10 They also took some time to complain about the community and the killers in place of
02:42:14 the longstanding issues, and the whole event had people from all sides pretty bummed out.
02:42:20 This hoping heart will be uplifted in the weeks to come.
02:42:23 That's it for this time.
02:42:24 And remember, the slime time is the best time.
02:42:28 Oh, seemed to have some time left.
02:42:31 Fuck you guy who set the PCP episode for too long.
02:42:34 Fuck you for telling us that we shouldn't send in voicemails this week.
02:42:38 Guess what?
02:42:39 This one is twice as long.
02:42:40 That's right.
02:42:41 A full minute 20.
02:42:42 Piss in your general direction.
02:42:43 Your mother was a slime corp grunt, and your father was a stay dead.
02:42:53 The word, pretty much the two worst things you could be.
02:42:56 I was going to say, I hope the ones that decided to take a break from gang warfare, I hope what
02:43:05 you mean is that they committed suicide and went stay dead.
02:43:08 Historically, that is how you register disdain for gang violence, is by killing yourself
02:43:15 and being a ghost and hanging out in the sewers.
02:43:19 I hope that culture is still alive and well.
02:43:22 Oh, the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on.
02:43:37 Okay, next one is called Prince Isolation BTWs A Question Answered, 3, 2, 1, go.
02:43:44 Oh yeah, you guys were asking where that little message is, where you say that the PCP still
02:43:52 has a hashtag that takes Twitter questions.
02:43:56 It's on the PCP voicemail speak pipe page.
02:43:59 When you click the link below your videos on the description, yeah, that's where it is.
02:44:05 I see, I would never, I didn't even, hmm, okay, all right, maybe we should update that.
02:44:14 Maybe.
02:44:15 Maybe.
02:44:16 Okay, next one is a vocaru file, all right, 3, 2, 1, go.
02:44:26 Oh, my God, my baby's about to say his first word, come here mate, look at, oh, it's Ethan.
02:44:46 What did he say?
02:44:47 See?
02:44:48 I can't hear it, stupid baby, stupid baby, that's barely, speak English, what are you,
02:45:03 foreign babies, freak, can't understand you, give me a fucking break, anyway, there's an
02:45:10 image, actually I'm not sure if this is, I think this is unrelated, yeah, the next voicemail
02:45:17 is an image, that's the girl who thinks phantom horn is a trans allegory, has changed a major
02:45:25 feature of his body in a way that made him happier, trans colors, there they are, yeah,
02:45:32 has a dead name, but what's phantom horn's dead name, you know it, is it phantom horn,
02:45:39 no, you don't remember his family name, oh, fuck, it was something like the dad is, wait,
02:45:54 is it standard?
02:45:55 It is standard, yeah, they're the standard family, so he's just a standard guy, until
02:46:01 yeah, he changed his last name to horn, well his full name, it was substandard, lol, I
02:46:09 imagine being like born and your parents call you substandard, well he was meant to make
02:46:15 sandwiches at the deli, that was his destiny, but he decided that he had a higher calling
02:46:21 in life, it's funny, who names the pony, like it would have been a baby, a little filly,
02:46:30 he doesn't know that he doesn't have a cutie mark about subways, I think it might have
02:46:35 been a digi brony thing theory, or maybe it wasn't even digi brony, maybe it was some
02:46:41 other one, but someone had a theory that a pony's name can change if their cutie mark,
02:46:51 that a pony can change their name when they get their cutie mark, and that would explain
02:46:54 why some ponies have weirdly on the nose names, I mean it's the only way you could explain
02:47:01 that really. Yeah, so it was according to that theory,
02:47:07 their family runs like a deli, and their dad was like, this son is going to make the sandwiches,
02:47:15 and so they called him substandard, and yeah, I mean that's it, that's the joke.
02:47:23 So it owns at least one katana, it's the next thing, I guess that's a trans, you know,
02:47:32 I don't have a real katana, but I do have a fake one in the corner, little wooden one.
02:47:37 I have a couple, I guess I'm not trans, but I have a couple shinai, I have the bamboo training
02:47:43 swords, that's like pretty close, that should count for something, that means I'm an ally.
02:47:48 That's a non-binary sword, I think. Oh, well, oops.
02:47:53 Former question mark, MLP fan, do they mean like phantom horn?
02:48:01 Yeah, I mean he canonically, you know, he had the YouTube channel where he reviewed
02:48:07 My Little Pony the show. Did you ever like explore like the in-world
02:48:17 like implications, like is phantom horn watching a show that takes place in his hometown?
02:48:23 Yes. Like a documentary?
02:48:26 The answer is just, no, I think it's, honestly, I'm not sure if it's like, if this is a documentary
02:48:34 about like Princess Twilight Sparkle coming to live in Ponyville, or if it's about like
02:48:38 fictional characters in a real setting. Yeah, I'm not sure which of those is true, I don't
02:48:43 think we ever really thought about it. One of them is definitely true. Like, yeah, actually
02:48:52 that's a great question, like are the main six and like all the events of the show, like
02:48:56 are they canon to the T-Bap universe? I don't know. Maybe I should ask Nate his opinion
02:49:03 about it. Like the T-Bap universe is, the T-Bap universe
02:49:08 is the My Little Pony universe, if nothing interesting happened.
02:49:12 The T-Bap universe is the Brony Analyst universe, because like Gibb and Take and all the others,
02:49:19 I love Kim Possible a lot, technically, because you appeared in her video.
02:49:25 I did. I did, yes.
02:49:28 Everything's connected. Dr. Wolf is part of that universe.
02:49:31 It is all connected.
02:49:33 Yeah, well, the most sensible thing is that they're actors, actresses, and they play like a show.
02:49:40 Like, what if our world was cool, the show?
02:49:43 That's kind of like what real shows are like.
02:49:47 I suppose so.
02:49:49 What if our world was cool? Yeah, do you think that's how it is with the
02:49:56 the Brony Analyst community at large? Are the events of My Little Pony merely fictional
02:50:04 events set in the world that those YouTuber avatar characters inhabit?
02:50:13 Yes.
02:50:15 Then I guess that's how it is for T-Bap, too.
02:50:19 Yeah, I mean, make sense to me.
02:50:22 Honestly, now I wonder if there's an answer to this among like the Rift Cafe.
02:50:27 I wonder if the Rift Cafe exists anymore.
02:50:29 I very much doubt it exists in any forum like they used to.
02:50:36 I mean, I'm sure it would be different. I would imagine people just like are still friends.
02:50:41 I mean, some of them still do pony content.
02:50:44 People still, there are still pony YouTubers, still pony tubing.
02:50:49 Is Dr. Wolf still releasing like an analysis anarchy episodes?
02:50:55 I think he is. Yeah, I think so.
02:50:59 Incredible.
02:51:01 Now, I shake my finger.
02:51:06 I wag my finger at anyone that tells me that Phantom's Revenge is too niche and can't succeed
02:51:14 when analysis anarchy, you know, is a cultural juggernaut in a powerhouse.
02:51:21 Like that's, it's honestly, it's just, well, it's maybe not just as stupid or just as niche.
02:51:29 I mean, Team Fortress 2 is something that more people know about.
02:51:33 It's Team Fortress 2 and it's like jokes on the level of Big Bang Theory.
02:51:37 Yeah, honestly, I guess it is even more niche than analysis anarchy.
02:51:44 Were you there in the panel room?
02:51:46 Yes.
02:51:47 That we went to in the BronyCon 20 years.
02:51:50 We sat right behind Christian.
02:51:52 Oh, God, she was there.
02:51:54 She was like right in front of us.
02:51:58 Well, yeah, what a time to be alive.
02:52:02 What it was, they were good, good times.
02:52:08 Anyway, rest of this image.
02:52:10 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:52:10 So former MLP fan and Loccom equals found family, I suppose that's true.
02:52:17 Yep, for sure.
02:52:18 Transitioned from Pony to SlimePony.
02:52:22 That is, that is true.
02:52:23 The ultimate HRT is Slime.
02:52:27 You're jet, you're probably not wrong at all.
02:52:31 That's literally alters your DNA.
02:52:33 Yeah, there's, there's no, you're just right.
02:52:38 You're just right about that.
02:52:40 Slime has an E in it, coincidence.
02:52:42 I don't know.
02:52:44 Like estrogen, like as much like estrogen, yeah.
02:52:49 And epic epic communist classic trans character trait.
02:52:55 Now, I'm not sure.
02:52:56 I'm not sure how much of this is tongue in cheek.
02:53:00 But I mean, I'll just say that, like.
02:53:03 I mean, Phantom is this isn't a stretch at all.
02:53:06 Phantom is explicitly, honestly,
02:53:10 originally sort of a cruel mockery.
02:53:13 That's overstate.
02:53:15 He's sort of a cruel send up of being trans originally in a way that I feel
02:53:20 some guilt over in the way that I originally.
02:53:24 Invasion, I didn't.
02:53:25 I mean, I didn't mean him as like, I didn't mean him in like a cruel way.
02:53:29 But in hindsight, I feel like the way that I
02:53:32 designed him in a way that was commenting on like, yeah.
02:53:37 I identify with having a horn.
02:53:39 Yeah, I don't I don't really.
02:53:42 I don't I mean, I wouldn't literally has like purple hair and has pronouns.
02:53:46 I mean, he literally does.
02:53:48 He literally has his blue fur, blue fur and pronouns.
02:53:56 He he what could I what could I say?
02:53:59 What could I say about him?
02:54:00 He I mean, I was I guess I was just defending
02:54:05 being transracial on this very podcast.
02:54:07 And that's basically what Phantom is.
02:54:10 So like.
02:54:12 Yeah, he was he was sort of he was sort of supposed to be.
02:54:16 A like.
02:54:19 I hate to say it.
02:54:20 This is this is true.
02:54:22 But I think he was kind of supposed to be like an S.J.W.
02:54:25 that takes it too far.
02:54:27 You know what I mean?
02:54:28 He's like, oh, well, this is this is he's he's just taken it.
02:54:31 He's just gone too far with all this.
02:54:34 His weird, his progressive values or whatever.
02:54:37 And now I just think he's he's just I just agree.
02:54:41 I have come to just agree with him unironically.
02:54:44 That's that's character development.
02:54:46 I yeah, so he's no longer a joke.
02:54:52 And and that's a and that's character development.
02:54:55 Yeah, you're right. You said it.
02:54:57 So there you go.
02:55:00 You're this image is just correct, I guess, more or less.
02:55:04 True good to get through all I can say is true.
02:55:11 Yep. OK, the next one is
02:55:15 next one is called One Piece Lamel three to one go.
02:55:21 You know, I hope I still made it in time for the podcast because
02:55:24 I heard you had trouble like getting it on Spotify and Google Music and stuff.
02:55:28 So I hope I can help you by saying like you got all the distro kids now.
02:55:31 I heard really great service costs like ten bucks.
02:55:34 So you have to log in and it probably tells you what to do.
02:55:38 I don't really know. So what it maybe check it out.
02:55:42 I thought I thought what's he recommending?
02:55:43 Obviously, you don't know how to do it.
02:55:45 So I thought I something something Spotify.
02:55:48 So keep it up.
02:55:50 I've been listening to the podcast in like a couple of months
02:55:52 because because I'm on Spotify, I'm like, well, I'm going to listen to it.
02:55:56 So I hope I can help. Bye bye.
02:55:57 Thank you.
02:55:59 Thanks for the voice.
02:56:01 I think that was a joke.
02:56:03 No, I think he maybe just didn't realize that's what he sounded like.
02:56:08 Like if you do it through your phone and you don't listen back to it.
02:56:10 I can't tell.
02:56:11 I can't tell if that was like a serious voicemail or not.
02:56:14 I could barely make out what he was saying.
02:56:16 I think he was just saying, hey, I'm ending some service that does something
02:56:21 that helps with putting it on Spotify.
02:56:23 OK, well, thanks.
02:56:26 But I think you need a little help getting it on.
02:56:28 Speaking, getting it on speak. Yes. Yes, exactly.
02:56:30 Yes, you're you got it.
02:56:33 You got to fix your own house.
02:56:35 Fix your own house before you try to clean up my living room, buddy.
02:56:41 Next one is called puns four weeks late.
02:56:44 Three, two, one, go.
02:56:47 An episode there, too.
02:56:48 You were trying to come up with puns for marriage, divorce and a cliff.
02:56:51 How about they being in a rocky relationship?
02:56:54 What?
02:56:56 Oh, a rocky, oh, a rocky relationship.
02:57:00 Yes, in the slime times, we can update about the two people getting married.
02:57:05 Yeah, yeah, two people got married
02:57:08 and then they like shoved each other off cliffs and died.
02:57:10 So a rocky relationship, like they died on the rocks.
02:57:14 Oh, yeah, I think that works.
02:57:16 I don't recall that.
02:57:17 Maybe it wasn't on that one.
02:57:20 I remember.
02:57:21 So, yeah, you know what?
02:57:22 This is better than anything I came up with.
02:57:24 I would say that's a I would give this a solid B plus.
02:57:28 And that's at least a passing grade.
02:57:32 I think that's it.
02:57:33 Is it the last one?
02:57:34 Yeah, that's our last horseman.
02:57:36 There we go.
02:57:37 We did it.
02:57:38 All right.
02:57:40 I feel like I got.
02:57:41 I feel like I said some I had some insights to share on this episode.
02:57:47 Glad I got to talk about phantom a little bit.
02:57:50 Glad I got to talk about my views on transracialism
02:57:55 and saying the N word on this episode.
02:57:58 Pretty pretty.
02:58:02 I'm happy with I I can.
02:58:04 I can look myself in the mirror and say you're on a podcast and respect
02:58:10 the face I see and say, how are you?
02:58:12 How are you the winning sperm?
02:58:17 I can look at myself at the end of the day.
02:58:19 I can still look myself in the eye and say you are on a podcast.
02:58:25 I guess that's it.
02:58:27 Yes.
02:58:28 Play phantom's revenge.
02:58:30 Play phantom's revenge.
02:58:31 Play pumpkin alley.
02:58:32 The pumpkin patch.
02:58:34 Check out the pumpkin patch.
02:58:35 Find that eight lizards.
02:58:37 Can you find eight lizards?
