00:00:00 Sword art online doesn't even make sense. I mean, it's online, yeah, but there's sword
00:00:08 art. Like, I always thought it was when I saw the dojins of sword art online, I thought,
00:00:15 uh, how do you fuck a sword? Like, why did the people draw sword art? And obviously it's
00:00:23 online, it's on dojinmoe.com. Like, what, what, why do you call it online? Why do you,
00:00:34 and it's art, yeah, but the sword, I don't get it, and I didn't get it. And then I heard
00:00:39 that there was an anime called Sword Art Online. I was like, oh, it's inspired by the, it's,
00:00:44 it's characters from the anime called Sword Art Online. And I just kept thinking, like,
00:00:49 what a stupid name for a thing to be sword art online. I mean, what could it be about?
00:00:53 Could it be about an artist? Oh, wait. Oh, sword art, like the art of sword swinging.
00:01:00 Couldn't you call it like blade fucking guy, blade nigger two, blade nigger attacks them,
00:01:11 you know? I mean, he wears black. Uh, welcome to the first in a 48 Pot series on why sword
00:01:26 art online sucks. Oh, here's pot one, the everything. Pot one, the everything, everything
00:01:40 sucks. There's a guy, and there's a girl, and there's a boy, and there's a girl, and there's
00:01:46 a woman, and there's a boy, and there's a guy, and then they're all homosexuals. Nothing
00:01:55 wrong with homosexuals, but I hate them. Oh, here's a lot of, a lot of, a lot of all
00:02:05 that stuff and sword art online. And it will fetch me my tin crumpets, just me, just me,
00:02:14 just think of it as, I just love a tin crumpet, swine me with a polka.
00:02:37 That's enough tin crumpets, and back to the review. Part two, sword art online.
00:02:44 It's not good.
00:03:14 Part three. No. No more. This ends now. I've never seen sword art online. I've never seen
00:03:31 Attack on Titan. I've never seen Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. I always thought Full
00:03:37 Metal Panic was part of that series, and I got confused. I'm like, which do I watch first,
00:03:42 Full Metal Alchemist or Full Metal Panic? I hate things that have things that aren't numbered,
00:03:48 but it wasn't even part of the same fucking show. I mean, people, you act like you're supposed to be
00:03:56 liking anime? Well, it's hard, okay? It's all confusing. It's dumb, and I don't get it. I mean,
00:04:02 Crunchyroll doesn't even work. I go there, and I'm looking at it, and I'm like, typing in fucking,
00:04:10 I don't know what I'm looking for. How do you get into new things? How do you get to a point
00:04:15 in your life where you're looking at new anime? What are you fucking gay? Just stick with what
00:04:21 you know. I watched so much Naruto, and then Naruto Shippepa do it in, and fucking it was all
00:04:28 right, but I couldn't bring myself to do anything else. And I wonder why that is. You know, you're
00:04:35 seeing a new thing, you're like, you know, when you're a little boy, and you're on anime,
00:04:44 anime stream, I don't fucking know, anime, lovelyanimateplace.com, and you see the top ones,
00:04:53 you see Naruto, you see One Piece and Bleach, and you're like, oh, people at school talk about
00:04:58 Naruto and Bleach, and you watch him. The asshole, but you don't realize that it's fun,
00:05:08 but you do it because you want to fit in. Like, I remember one guy saying, do you even know Naruto?
00:05:14 Like, I was pretending I did, because I'm one of those, you know, I just one of those moments
00:05:19 where you just say something, and he said, do you even know Naruto? Do you know Shikomaru?
00:05:28 And I'm like, uh, do you even know Zabusa? I'm like, do you even know Itachi?
00:05:37 I'm sorry, I'm very sorry. I don't know that dude. I guess I don't know it at all. And then
00:05:43 they killed me. They stuffed me in a bunch of trash, a bunch of rubbish, a carcass.
00:05:51 Yes. I was. What a carcass I was as they rolled me down the hill in a trash bin.
00:06:00 And I thought to myself, well, I really need to impress those guys. So I watched Naruto.
00:06:09 I want a rocks. Many rocks. What does he want to do with them? I want a rocks.
00:06:21 My Japanese man. What does he want to do with the rocks? I want a rocks.
00:06:29 You want to rock or you want to rocks? Oh, many rocks.
00:06:38 Well, the way.
00:06:46 You may realize that this is stupid and it's deliberately so.
00:06:51 See if I see it deliberate, then it's okay.
00:06:56 I, I don't appreciate your time and which is why I'm spending it doing nothing.
00:07:06 This is going on the procrastinators channel. It's a podcast now. It's suddenly now a podcast.
00:07:13 The Gibbon show where nothing is quite right. Now that I'm doing a show, it's time to fill the air.
00:07:28 I need to fill my lungs with air.
00:07:32 Delicious air. Doesn't it feel great to just take a big whiff of air, even though you don't need it?
00:07:37 It sounds funny too. It sounds funny.
00:07:44 Hey, let's, let's look at my DS. Let's do an impromptu game review of whatever I have on my DS.
00:07:49 Oh, it's Pokemon moon. All right. Here's a sneak peek of my game of the year video.
00:07:53 In fact, this is my game of the year video. I'm going to slip this bit out of,
00:07:56 I'm going to put this bit out of this video and put it into my video because I don't, I don't like,
00:08:02 I don't like you. All right. I wrote down some notes from Pokemon moon. Let's go to the mind of
00:08:07 my notes. Oh, where is it? Oh yeah. Pokemon moon. Pokemon moon is fine. The main point I have,
00:08:19 it's a, it says good for a Pokemon game, which means it has the staples. Cool Pokemon, uncool
00:08:27 Pokemon, battling, catching, bad guy gang, roots, towns, poker centers, boring characters and towns,
00:08:35 people, status effects, Zubat and others. But it's slightly better than the normal staples
00:08:43 because they have interesting characters. They got the edgelord and a goofy troop of loopy dukes
00:08:51 and their loopy king and the insane woman who I can imagine is actually very scary to young
00:08:57 children. So that's good. You know, it's always nice to know that children are scared. Then there's
00:09:03 the punching bag and the professor who's not a nerd and the girl and popcorn. And that's it.
00:09:10 That's my Pokemon moon review. You know, if I had a beer bottle, I would jangle it just to make,
00:09:20 give you the illusion that I was drinking, but I don't have a beer bottle. I do have these things
00:09:25 or cards I keep dropping on the table. That's what the cards were. That's what that was. I'm not
00:09:31 even starting to begin to make like a good video podcast, but you're still here, I guess. Hey,
00:09:37 you ever know these sunglasses that I have? Here's what they sound like.
00:09:46 They're sunglasses. They're very plasticky. They're very, very plasticky.
00:09:51 That's it. That's my sunglasses ASMR section of the video. Now we've got to have a,
00:09:57 we've got to have, oh, look, listen to this, listen to this shit. All right. In my hand is a special
00:10:03 button. It is a button that will tell me and you that we are a badass and it will give us confidence.
00:10:11 And this is a real thing and I'm about to press it. Here we go. Do what you love.
00:10:15 Do what we love. All right. What else do you want? What else wisdoms do you have?
00:10:21 You create your reality.
00:10:24 All right. Feed fear, a sucket, sandwich, sandwich.
00:10:33 You are a badass.
00:10:37 I've never been so insulted in all my life. I know my mom didn't give this to me
00:10:44 because she thinks I'm insecure. She just had it. I mean, she says that, but she's given me
00:10:50 like self-help books before because she thinks I'm still as depressed as I was when I was 17,
00:10:55 which isn't true. How fucking patronizing can you fucking be?
00:11:03 It's unbelievable. Zero, zero out of 10 on product. It came, hang on, it came with,
00:11:11 it came with this book. You are a badass mini book and it's not a joke. This is,
00:11:19 oh my God. I was about to say this is as sincere and patronizing as it can possibly be.
00:11:26 The guy who wrote it is called Jen Sincero. S-I-N-C-E-R-O. Jen Sincero. Okay. Maybe it is a joke.
00:11:37 How could it be not a joke? Jen Sincero. I'm assuming you're reading this that there,
00:11:43 because you're reading this, there are some areas of your life that aren't looking so great
00:11:48 and that you know you could be doing looking a whole lot better. This book is about getting
00:11:52 mighty clear about what makes you happy and what makes you feel the most alive and then creating
00:11:58 it instead of pretending you can't have it or that you don't deserve it or that you're a greedy
00:12:02 ego, maniacal fathead for wanting more than you already have. I guess it is a joke. I mean,
00:12:08 maybe it's like, I assumed that it was like talking like, oh, we're a self-help book and we're,
00:12:17 you know, you're not that bad, you're great, you know, but, and it is saying that it's the whole
00:12:22 book about, like, number one, appreciate how special you are. Number two, drown yourself in
00:12:28 affirmations. Number three, ditch the self-deprecating humor that this is the sort of stuff. Oh, let the
00:12:35 love in. Oh, forgive yourself. Don't compare yourself to others. I guess, no, this is very
00:12:42 sincere. Love yourself. It's a sincere self-help you book by written by someone with a bit of
00:12:49 self-awareness, but not enough. Like that they can say, stop calling yourself an ego maniacal fathead
00:12:56 because you're beautiful. I'm so mad at how fucking stupid this is. Do what you love. No,
00:13:05 well, I will, but shut up. I don't want to do it because you told me to, you fucking idiot.
00:13:11 You create your reality. You create your reality. What does it say?
00:13:15 Feed fear a sucket sandwich. A sucket sandwich, sandwich. Fuck it. Oh, oh, unacceptable.
00:13:31 That was terrible. Sorry for that. Sorry for that. Lemon. I can't do lemon.
00:13:36 How to tap into the motherload, the G word. Hang on, what? Wherever you happen to stand on the
00:13:44 God issue. Let me just say that this whole improving your life thing is going to be a lot easier if
00:13:49 you have an open mind about it. Call it whatever you want. God, God ass, the big guy, the universe,
00:13:56 source energy, higher power, the grand poo bar, gut, intuition, spirit, the force, the zone,
00:14:03 the force fuck off, the zone, the Lord, the vortex, the motherload. It doesn't matter. Whatever
00:14:09 you choose to call it is important. What is important is that you start to develop an
00:14:14 awareness of and a relationship with the source energy that's surrounding you and with you and
00:14:20 with you and you. We enjoy the same engine. We should give you the best pale air if you give it
00:14:24 a chance because you think all of us are connected to the limit of this power and some of us aren't
00:14:28 being a fucking, a fucking, a fucking, a fucking hippies. Oh, meditation 101, basic meditation
00:14:34 Fuck you. You make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like an actual retard,
00:14:48 retard. Oh, love yourself. Surrender for people who, this is like a training guide for fucking
00:14:58 sheltered social justice warrior people. Like, I'm reading this one thing. It just,
00:15:05 it just gives me that idea that people who turn to this weird way of thinking are usually very
00:15:12 self-conscious. Surround yourself with people who think the way you want to think.
00:15:19 That's a, that's a thing they say. You've got to surround yourself with like-minded people.
00:15:23 Obviously makes sense in theory, but like, you go too far with it and you're in a fucking hug
00:15:29 box. You're in a, you're in an echo chamber. You're thinking about a lot of the same, oh,
00:15:38 I'm sorry I'm going on about this. It's just, I don't feel any reason to keep this stupid
00:15:44 You are a badass button. So, and this book, so I'm reading it now just to get it out of my life.
00:15:52 I don't ever want to return to it. Number five, love yourself. You deserve it. I really am,
00:15:59 I think it's got to be a joke. Really, what it is, is that I press this thinking,
00:16:07 it's going to be like, whoa, cool dude, you're a badass, guitars and explosions, you know,
00:16:12 something cringy, but something like, something harmlessly cringy, like, dude, whoa, radical,
00:16:19 you're cool. Yeah, bro, but it's just this sort of sounding American lady saying sincere and very
00:16:30 patronizing bullshit. How to get over your BS already. Procrastination and perfection.
00:16:37 Procrastination is one of the most popular forms of self-sabotage because it's really easy. I mean,
00:16:43 I get it, I agree, but I hate that you are saying it. I fucking hate you. I want you to die.
00:16:52 Blah blah blah. Because it's not like I don't know how to stop procrastinating, it's that
00:16:59 knowing it is not half the battle, knowing it is like one percent of the battle.
00:17:05 Doing it is the hardest part and it's the entire part.
00:17:13 How to kick some ass.
00:17:23 I really want to burn this book. It's worth it. It annoys me just like,
00:17:33 what annoys me the most is that the idea that somebody would buy this for somebody
00:17:37 and somebody would actually have a use for it, like they would, they would press the button
00:17:41 and feel better. Like that is the saddest thing I could possibly imagine.
00:17:49 Like if you need that in your life to get through, like I can imagine someone on the
00:17:55 brink of suicide and there's someone like, oh he's depressed, I should get him this and he presses it
00:18:01 once and he just, like it's just, I would commit suicide after hearing that.
00:18:15 After hearing this button being pressed, I would just crumple in a heap and like, oh it's not worth
00:18:20 it anymore. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:18:36 That was my OC dog. I don't know, he's a furry. He's gay, he's a gay furry.
00:18:43 So when it comes to like podcasts and stuff, usually I have a topic and a theme and or a
00:18:54 topic and a theme and like a thing of consciousness, a stream of consciousness,
00:18:58 which is what this is, this is a stream of consciousness and it doesn't have any guests
00:19:02 and this is a one-time podcast. It will never happen again ever. I will never make another
00:19:07 podcast because I have integrity. I don't want anyone to know that I did this,
00:19:16 which is why I'm putting on the internet for the cheap laugh and a cock in my buttock.
00:19:23 Just one though. I'm just looking at things on my desk that seem like, what can I fucking
00:19:30 talk about? I've got a camera over here, I've got a camera over there, I've got a fucking
00:19:35 piece of paper. Oh boy, let's talk about a piece of paper. You know, guys, we've got a piece of
00:19:41 paper here, let's hear it. That's not a piece of paper, that's a pad of paper. Yeah, you thought
00:19:48 you were just listening to a piece of paper? You've got a whole pad, pad of paper here.
00:19:53 It's a bunch of sticky notes. And that's that. I don't stick them anywhere, I just write on them.
00:20:02 Sheesh. Are you still here, you idiot? You dumb idiot?
00:20:10 I can't believe you even, even in the background. Like, why would you put this on in the background?
00:20:14 You'd be like, ha ha, Gibbs talking, lol, hippos being a silly boy.
00:20:23 And then you think it's buffering because like, I had silence. Because you're not looking at it,
00:20:30 you're like, oh, what happened? What was he saying? Did something happen? No, I just tricked you.
00:20:37 You're fucking, I got you.
00:20:43 I mean, part of me thinks, oh, this is awful, I'll never put this up, but part of
00:20:47 me loves it, part of me loves how terrible it is. Hey, look, we've got a magic eight ball.
00:20:53 Magic eight ball is something I associate with Risker, but also with Toy Story,
00:21:00 because it's the thing that Woody shakes and he's like, I fucking hate Buzz Lightyear and he says,
00:21:04 yeah, you do, or something. And it's like integral to the to the fucking buzz getting knocked out of
00:21:14 the room. And it's what a weird scene that is. Like, I always thought that it was really unnerving
00:21:20 because of it's a sunset, but it's like really harsh lighting in dark areas. And
00:21:26 and it's not really, it's not really clear what time of day, like, it's not really clear what
00:21:32 everyone's thinking. Like everyone's sort of like they're sleeping their toys. It's weird. It's a weird,
00:21:37 like the very end of a sunset sort of lighting, but it's darker than that. And it's all about Woody
00:21:44 conspiring with the with with hatching a plan to get Buzz fucking lost.
00:21:52 What a great movie. You know, I don't I don't care what people say about like dated CG.
00:22:00 Because like CG, I like old CG games. You know, it's only dated in the
00:22:09 that they try to make realistic humans. And you can obviously make realistic humans a lot better now.
00:22:17 But the toys, they all look perfect. Because they're toys. I mean, that's probably part of the
00:22:21 reason why they made it in 3D. Like, oh, we can't we got this new technology. But how the fuck do
00:22:27 we make a whole bunch of characters? It's going to be a nightmare. It's like, I don't worry,
00:22:31 just make them toys, just make it so that you don't have to animate their body parts moving
00:22:35 and breathing and all that shit. And it's like, perfect. We got it. Toy Story is great. What do
00:22:43 I mean? Shrek. Shrek's a good movie. Shrek 2 is one of the greatest 3D animated movies.
00:22:55 If you don't believe me, do you think it's just a meme? We'll just remember the Billy Maze was a
00:23:00 meme and he was fucking amazing. Michael Rosen's a meme and everyone loves Michael Rosen. He's
00:23:05 actually a very good children's entertainer. People make fun of what they like. You know,
00:23:13 you don't see many YouTube poops with Pootie Pie in it. Maybe a couple to ride the thing,
00:23:18 ride the train of hype when he was like beginning to be a thing that people would search for.
00:23:24 Shrek's good. I don't know about the B movie. The B movie doesn't look good, but maybe it is.
00:23:36 Shrek's good. I mean, the third one was, you didn't need to make the third one and the fourth one
00:23:41 was kind of like, come on, you've done it. You've finished. Actually, the ending of the third one
00:23:48 is pretty cool, but like, I think the second one is really the peak. First one's pretty great.
00:23:54 Second one, the best. Kung Fu Panda as well. Kung Fu Panda movies, I don't know. Nate, for some
00:24:02 reasons, seems to think that Dreamworks is all shit. And I don't know why. I guess he just like,
00:24:09 he just had that opinion from some experience and he's not willing to give any other Dreamworks
00:24:15 movie the time of day, like Madagascar 1. It's all right. You know, I don't know whether it's great,
00:24:22 but they're all great children's movies at least. But like, Kung Fu Panda 1 and 3, I haven't seen 2,
00:24:32 I should, because I've seen the ending of 2 and it looked great. But 1 and 3, they're really good
00:24:37 movies. Like, such action. You know, I like Kung Fu Panda 3 more than The Force Awakens.
00:24:46 Don't know what that says about me. I went, I went to see both of them in the theaters,
00:24:51 which is why I make that comparison. Because I don't go to see things in the theaters ever.
00:24:58 Like, this year, I don't think I went to see anything. What movies came out?
00:25:06 Obviously, I haven't gone very recently. No, I haven't seen a single movie this year.
00:25:11 Not one. Not a single movie that came out this year I have seen this year. That's one of the
00:25:17 things I've noticed. Like, people are making of the year, of the year lists of things like movies
00:25:23 and albums and stuff. And I'm like, I'm just rediscovering or rather discovering
00:25:33 stuff from when I was a kid, because that's what I like. I don't like new things.
00:25:39 Not that I don't like new things, but like, new things often are uninteresting.
00:25:47 Like games. Like, modern games. This is like a thing that people have said for a long time now,
00:25:53 but it still holds true for me. Like, modern games do not interest me at all. If it's big
00:25:57 budget, then it means it's a big no-no. On principle. Not on principle, actually, but
00:26:04 well, yeah, on principle. If it costs a lot to buy and it has a lot of DLC and it's one of those
00:26:08 pre-autobonus bullshit things, I will never purchase it. I will pirate it if I want to,
00:26:14 but I will never purchase it if it has all that bullshit. If it's just a game that comes out,
00:26:18 like The Witcher. I think I bought The Witcher 2 because I heard that it was a great game made by
00:26:25 great company. And if my computer could run it without exploding, then I would have played it, but
00:26:34 I don't purchase things that are bullshit. And so much of modern games is bullshit,
00:26:41 and so much of the console scene is, like, gone. Like, all my favorite characters have been
00:26:47 discontinued and replaced with white, boring people. That's right. That's right, I went there,
00:26:53 they're white. You ever thought why Uncharted sucks? Because it's not a black woman
00:27:00 with a dick and and three genders that change depending on what hour you're playing the game.
00:27:08 And it also changes the dialogue. Ooh, that's interesting. That's interesting. That's a stupid
00:27:12 way to make an interesting mechanic that changes about stuff. Depending on what time of day you're
00:27:18 playing the game, stuff is different. That's a cool concept. Too bad, no one cares.
00:27:24 But yeah, like Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, Spyro, Crash, they sort of died before the end
00:27:36 of the PS2 era, but like, you know, these characters, these colorful cartoon characters,
00:27:46 they just got fucked in the butt. Ratchet and Clank continued for a bit,
00:27:53 but Tools of Destruction was not interesting because it ended on a cliffhanger and it
00:27:58 suffered from what I like to call, fuck you, syndrome, where it's like
00:28:06 the first three Ratchet and Clank games, the first one was made and it was a complete game.
00:28:10 That was it. You played it, that was the Ratchet and Clank one. The sequel, same shit. You know,
00:28:16 even though they probably knew they were going to make Ratchet and Clank 3, they made Ratchet and
00:28:19 Clank 2 and it was completely, perfectly its own thing. You could play one or two, you didn't have
00:28:26 to play both. And then you got Ratchet and Clank 3, which is the same sort of thing. It
00:28:30 borrows elements from one and two, but you can play it on its own. It is, from start to finish,
00:28:35 a complete thing. Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction, the first game on the PS3,
00:28:41 was a cliffhanger ending game, which means it wasn't a complete thing, which means they were
00:28:46 planning to make another three games. And obviously, once you plan to make another three
00:28:51 of anything, the certain parts of, like, each individual thing becomes less, like the Hobbit
00:28:58 movies, you know, if they just thought, let's make the Hobbit movie. I mean, when you're making,
00:29:07 like, Lord of the Rings, each one is a whole book, fair enough. The book has a beginning and an ending,
00:29:14 but it will continue, but it's not like ending on a cliffhanger that's unsatisfying. So each film,
00:29:21 similarly, does not end unsatisfyingly. Everything that happened in the book is satisfying that it
00:29:25 completes itself, but it could still continue. The way the Ratchet and Clank did it was like the way
00:29:30 that they did it in the Star Wars prequels, or the Hobbit. The Hobbit, not so bad, but it's pretty
00:29:38 bad. Like, they had the dragon at the end of the second movie, but it didn't actually really happen
00:29:44 until the third movie. You've got to see him die at the, just the beginning of the third movie.
00:29:49 And it's all, it's marketing. It's not actually a film that feels complete in itself. It feels like
00:29:55 you have to watch all three at once, or at least the second and third at once. And it's just dumb.
00:30:01 And the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, did I say the Star Wars? I just said the prequel trilogy.
00:30:05 The Star Wars prequel trilogy was like the first movie was like introducing Anakin. The second movie
00:30:10 was nothing at all. And then the third movie was like the actual important part. Like, they had
00:30:18 three movies and like 13% of all three movies put together was actually a movie that was important
00:30:26 or interesting at all. And it's like you,
00:30:33 they're not satisfying for a very, a lot of reasons, but like the element that I find,
00:30:39 and I'm referencing here is that they don't feel complete in and of themselves. Maybe the first
00:30:45 one does. I'm not, I'm not sure about that. I can't really remember. Like, they do kind of like,
00:30:50 at the end is like, yeah, the droids are dead. Hooray. It feels like the end of a new hope.
00:30:55 It could continue, but right now they won. The second movie is like,
00:31:03 the point I'm getting at is that Ratchet and Clank died to me because the first PlayStation 3 game
00:31:09 was a cliffhanger that was completely unsatisfying. And I didn't like the characters or the story
00:31:14 that much. And I didn't like the extra mini content to do that much. And I was like, why the fuck
00:31:20 would I buy the next games if this one wasn't good? And so I never did. I never bought the PS3
00:31:26 trilogy of Ratchet and Clank. And I'm sure a lot of other people felt the same, which is why the
00:31:31 Ratchet and Clank is not the main thing. You know, if Insomniac had come up with a better idea than
00:31:42 the fucking glowy blue red asshole infamous guy that, you know, that they would actually have
00:31:50 a game series to talk about to make the next gen thing. Like, if infamous was not crap and boring
00:31:58 and disgustingly shit and blue and red, then they might have stopped making Ratchet and Clank and
00:32:03 made their own thing, like Naughty Dog Dig with Uncharted, which is all right. I don't like it
00:32:14 more than Jack and Daxter, obviously, but I don't begrudge it too much. It's okay.
00:32:21 You know, I feel sometimes I feel like I should play all of them. I have them.
00:32:26 It's like the PlayStation 2 thing, like everything that was cool about it, all the
00:32:38 cool series that started and ended. And then the PlayStation 3 comes out with my favorite game
00:32:46 companies coming up with boring shit that I didn't care about at all. It just, you know,
00:32:53 there was no equivalence of my favorite games like Okami and Dark Cloud.
00:32:58 And I will say Dark Souls is probably like the best thing to come out on that sort of
00:33:04 Demon Souls on the PS3, but then Dark Souls was on the PC and I obviously would go there instead.
00:33:09 Bloodborne I have on PS4, but Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 are on PC and I have them on there.
00:33:17 But like modern games aside from Dark Souls are boring and I don't like them ever.
00:33:25 I just don't like them. Every single time a thing comes up,
00:33:30 it's like whatever. Final Fantasy, I was never into it. You know, that's another thing. That's
00:33:36 unrelated to modern games being shit. It's just like fan things coming back like Ghostbusters,
00:33:44 never saw it. Final Fantasy, never played it. You know, remakes and I pressed the space bar
00:33:55 and I stopped recording. Reboots and remakes and stuff. There's just an ocarina of time on the
00:34:02 3DS or Majora's Mask on 3DS or like anything. Any big thing that has come back in like a fan way
00:34:10 and people like making a big hubbub about it. That's never happened for anything that I like ever.
00:34:18 I can't, I cannot recall a time where something has been remade or rebooted that I was into
00:34:25 aside from maybe Ratchet and Clank, which was a tie into a movie, but it was sort of,
00:34:32 there was no fanfare around it. Nobody really cares. I think that's just the thing. Like I'm in
00:34:37 that generation that was a little after all the classics like Mario and Zelda and Metroid,
00:34:44 Nintendo things, and then, you know, the PS1 games like Spyro and Crash Bandicoot and Conkers
00:34:50 Bad Fur Day and Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64 and Diddy Kong Racing and all those, you know,
00:34:56 ocarina of time. Everything that all the kids in the 90s were talking about, that's all coming back
00:35:00 now and the stuff that I'm into has yet to come back and it will eventually and all the people my
00:35:06 age, my generation who care about PS2 rather than PS1, they're all just not interested in anything
00:35:14 because there's nothing that's appealing to them. And it's a shame because it's like anything new
00:35:19 that's coming out has so much fanfare about it. You think about like a new game comes out and then
00:35:28 instantly there's porn of it. There's porn of it everywhere. You can just find every character
00:35:32 in every situation possible. Porn everywhere. Everywhere you go. Anywhere you want. Any character.
00:35:40 Pokemon Moon, like five seconds after it's released, there's porn of every character in the
00:35:44 whole game. Undertale, porn of everyone all the time. That's how I judge like the fan content
00:35:52 because I don't care about really anything else. But like when you think of like PS2 games,
00:35:57 I'm not sure whether I would look at Ratchet and Clank porn actually, but supposing I did,
00:36:03 there's not a lot of it. I don't think I've looked, but there probably isn't a lot. I have
00:36:07 looked at Carmelita Fox. There's a bit of that because she's a furry. But there's not a lot of
00:36:13 it. Like it's in that time where before it came out, before artists were making fan content of
00:36:21 that about stuff. So it's before the internet really was becoming big. But it's too late after
00:36:31 the classics because every time anybody wants a big, making a big art piece, they're like, oh,
00:36:38 I'll draw fucking Samus. And everyone knows Samus not only just because of Metroid, but also because
00:36:43 of Smash Brothers and stuff like that. Like you draw a character that was really old and has continued
00:36:51 to be there. Or you draw art of characters that were, you know, just, just before, you know,
00:37:00 Super Mario 64 stuff, fan content of that. Like there's mods of all that stuff. There's like crazy
00:37:07 modding communities. You all know Pan and Koic, right? Those guys, him and his buddies, I don't
00:37:13 really know what they're called again, the ABC crew. It just feels like, it feels like it's,
00:37:22 it's unfortunate because like there's old stuff and then there's new stuff and then there's the
00:37:25 stuff I'm into and it's all ignored by the internet in general. And I am mad about it to a certain
00:37:34 degree. I don't really care too much about seeing porn of my games that I like. I only brought that
00:37:39 up because I was thinking of Kamalita. All right? You know, some furry porn's all right.
00:37:47 It's just tits with fur on it. You just forget the fur is there. They didn't really draw it furry
00:37:52 anyway. They just draw it colored. It's like there's a boob and it looks like a normal person's boob,
00:37:58 but it's orange. Okay. It's a rabbit boob or a fox boob. They don't have a tail, but they otherwise
00:38:07 are human. What am I saying? You create your reality. I sure do. Idiot.
00:38:19 I just went on rants about things.
00:38:24 Oh, the podcast never ends and it will always remain directionless. It's the sort of thing
00:38:34 you would put on in the background, but you need to listen if you're trying to figure out
00:38:38 what I'm doing, saying and such. Since I'm in a dour mood, let's talk about a dour topic. Videos.
00:38:51 I don't want to. I don't want to do it. Videos suck. They're okay.
00:39:04 But, you know, they suck.
00:39:15 I'm making a game of the year. What the date is today? The 28th? All right. Well, I can't do it.
00:39:24 It's the end of the 28th. I've got to record me talking about Pokemon Moon and Dark Souls 3.
00:39:32 I've already talked about Pokemon Go. Those are the games of the game of the year.
00:39:37 I want to talk about all three of them in a game of the year video.
00:39:40 And I got to do it all at 29th and the 30th and the 31st. I'm glad there's a 31st.
00:39:49 Maybe I can do it, but, you know, and I don't want you to just say, oh, you can do it. Shut up.
00:39:57 That's also patronizing. It's like coming out to a wheelchair guy and saying,
00:40:00 don't worry. I still think you can walk.
00:40:05 There's nothing like that.
00:40:10 I know I can do it. You idiot. It's not like I really, really love you to say,
00:40:19 you, I feel sympathy for you.
00:40:24 If you're having trouble trying to do something, then whatever.
00:40:28 Everyone is. I think it's a bit redundant to say, oh, you know what, dude? I know how you're feeling.
00:40:35 I got stuff I want to do and I'm trying to do it and it's not working out so well.
00:40:40 But you know what? You just got to keep doing it and that's what you got to do.
00:40:43 And I'm like, I get it. I know. Thanks. Thanks for trying to help, but you're really boring.
00:40:51 You're really normal. You're really just wasting time.
00:40:55 You know, the amount of time you spend trying to cheer others up could be better spent being a cool guy,
00:41:04 making your own things and then using that to entertain them, just like what I'm doing.
00:41:12 You know? I mean, sure, if you made a podcast about complete bullshit, nobody would listen to it
00:41:18 if you didn't have a fan base already like I do. I'm not saying make a stupid podcast.
00:41:24 What I am saying is I'm an asshole who's telling you to not give me good feelings because...
00:41:41 Suck it, my dick.
00:41:47 I put two slices of bread in between my penis. Wait, no, how do you do that?
00:41:53 You two put your penis in between your slices of bread and then the magic happens.
00:42:04 Welcome to the close-up. Welcome to the close-up part of the show where I'm really close and I'm saying
00:42:11 Radio Shade, over and over.
00:42:41 Shit.
00:42:50 This isn't a decompression chamber more than it is an exhaustion tube. I was really
00:42:58 so tired that I couldn't move and I made a podcast right now.
00:43:03 Talking into a mic has helped me stay awake but now I'm tired again. Whoops, I should have just
00:43:14 started talking about bullshit, then got into an excited state and then used that to work on
00:43:20 something but instead I tried to make a podcast that kept going and going and here it is keeping
00:43:26 on going and now I'm tired again and I can't do it.
00:43:37 Let's see what's going on in the discord chat.
00:43:41 Mage is there talking about Sword Art Online. What are you doing?
00:43:47 You are a badass.
00:43:56 I can't even do a sentence.
00:44:05 I can't even do a sentence.
00:44:25 There's anything to have been gained from this. It's that you wasted your time but more importantly
00:44:35 that you wasted it with me and I idiot.
00:44:47 I just want to play video games, dude.
