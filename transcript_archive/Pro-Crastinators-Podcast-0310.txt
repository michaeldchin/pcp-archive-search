00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Hello, I am the Nostalgia Critic and this is my host, the best guy ever.
00:00:18 What's up? It's me, the best guy ever.
00:00:23 Turning red should have been about 9-11.
00:00:27 Is that a thing?
00:00:29 You must not have been looking at Twitter this week. That was a big funny thing this week.
00:00:34 Was it Mr. Enter's review of Turning Red said it was bad that it didn't properly reflect the fact that it takes place in 2002,
00:00:43 and that to reflect that, paranoia over 9-11 should have been a big theme of the movie.
00:00:50 What the fuck?
00:00:52 I don't know. I don't know.
00:00:55 I've seen bits and bobs about Mr. Enter being a horrible, terrible idiot.
00:01:01 But I already knew that, so I guess it's not that interesting.
00:01:04 It's funny, people lost their minds at him for this unbelievable take,
00:01:10 and on Twitter he responded by being like,
00:01:14 Jenny Nicholson put it best, his response was basically,
00:01:18 I've had way even worse opinions than this, and I can't believe this is what you're all mad at me about.
00:01:25 He's like, I'm literally an anti-vaxxer, and you guys are mad about this at me?
00:01:30 Fuck you!
00:01:32 And it's just great.
00:01:34 I don't know what drives a person to do that and be like that.
00:01:37 Oh yes, and Mr. Enter, one of Nate's aliases.
00:01:40 Yes, I remember.
00:01:43 Oh shit, did I say that out loud?
00:01:46 Well, you got, you killed him.
00:01:48 He's Mr, Mr, more like the best guy Enter.
00:01:52 What?
00:01:53 The best guy Enter the building, ladies and gentlemen.
00:01:57 Uh, I, what was it?
00:02:00 So this week, I did something, I just, I just, just as I finished before we started recording,
00:02:08 I finished, putting the finishing touches on what I was working on all this week,
00:02:13 I took a break away from doing the formatting on the Slime and Punishment book,
00:02:18 because I was drawing a guest page for Tales Gets Trolled.
00:02:21 Oh yes.
00:02:22 If you can believe, I spent a whole week, I spent a whole week doing that.
00:02:28 How big is the page?
00:02:30 It's not one book page.
00:02:31 It's not one book page.
00:02:32 It's like, can be huge because it's intimate.
00:02:34 No, it's like long, it's like long.
00:02:36 Here, I'll show, I'll show you my, my page.
00:02:39 Or, uh, yeah, mine was 18 panels.
00:02:43 Oh my God.
00:02:44 Yeah, so it's, it's not like one book page.
00:02:48 That's, that's more like, like three or four or five pages?
00:02:52 More four pages.
00:02:54 Probably, probably something like that.
00:02:56 Um, I think, I think this will have been published on the website by the time this episode comes out,
00:03:02 so it's probably fine to show it, but I'll link in the description to the page if it is,
00:03:08 uh, released on the website.
00:03:12 Um, so yeah, I spent like a whole week drawing this because I wanted to make it really good.
00:03:19 Meanwhile, back to Coyote.
00:03:22 Yeah.
00:03:23 In a great yard.
00:03:24 So, um, I had to, I had to catch up.
00:03:27 I am caught up on the story of Tales Gets Trolled, by the way.
00:03:30 It has, there's a lot, there's a lot that has happened since, um, like when I did the
00:03:37 lecture on it, uh, although they're still locked in battle.
00:03:42 Like Coyote and Demaro are still locked in the battle.
00:03:45 It's like the same day.
00:03:46 Uh, but I mean, there's like chapters and chapters and chapters have gone by.
00:03:52 I will eventually get around to, to reading it all.
00:03:56 Yeah.
00:03:57 I, at some point, I just sort of stopped because it was, it was getting, I mean, obviously
00:04:03 it's like, it's stupid, but like I feel like some of the gut buster, like I can't believe
00:04:09 this is a comic moments were very early on.
00:04:13 I don't know if like it continues to be as hilarious as it goes.
00:04:18 It continues to be, it continues to be very like shonen battle anime.
00:04:23 It also continues to be, you know, it has, it has, there's cutaways to like a bunch of
00:04:29 like trolls talking about like the ramifications of the battle and like they're kind of pursuing
00:04:34 their own side missions and whatever.
00:04:37 And those are like, you know, weird and bizarre and all the trolls look ridiculous and stuff.
00:04:43 Uh, the battle between, the cosmic battle between God and Satan continues to be a central
00:04:51 focus of the, of the plot.
00:04:55 Uh, I requested, because on the, on the semi official, um, audio books that one guy is
00:05:04 making on YouTube, I was, I was given the voice of Satan.
00:05:07 I voiced Satan in the scene where they, they drink the blood and get the neutral powers.
00:05:13 So I asked, um, I asked Emmergram if he had a page with Satan in it that I could draw.
00:05:19 And he was like, as a matter of fact, I'm like editing one right now.
00:05:25 Uh, so he gave me this page.
00:05:27 What happens in this page?
00:05:29 Okay.
00:05:30 So previously, after four reasons that are too complicated to get into, Coyote does some
00:05:36 stuff, but he like exhausts himself and he's, and he's going to faint.
00:05:40 So instead of fainting out in the real world, he off screen sort of puts himself into his
00:05:47 book world and then he falls to the ground in the book world.
00:05:51 But Demaro, he also put Demaro and the ghost of Gary into his book world.
00:05:57 So now Coyote is unconscious on the ground in the book world and Demaro is there and
00:06:03 Demaro tries to get to him, but also passes out unconscious while attempting to go and
00:06:08 kill Coyote.
00:06:09 Uh, and the ghost of Gary is here and he doesn't like either of them.
00:06:15 Uh, so that's, and then there's a cutaway to Satan.
00:06:20 Uh, and then some, some things happen.
00:06:23 Things.
00:06:24 And that's, and that's my page.
00:06:26 Yeah.
00:06:27 I spent all week drawing it.
00:06:29 Uh, and I'm pretty proud of it.
00:06:30 It's very good.
00:06:31 Yeah.
00:06:32 I'm, I'm very happy.
00:06:33 I'm very happy with how it came out.
00:06:35 Some, some guest artists, some guest artists try to duplicate, uh, you know, the, the laser
00:06:44 bot style of drawing.
00:06:46 And sometimes it works.
00:06:48 And sometimes it, I think it just doesn't, like they can't quite do it.
00:06:52 And it ends up kind of just looking bad anyway.
00:06:55 I decided not to even bother with doing that because I thought, I don't think I could do
00:06:58 it.
00:06:59 It would actually be harder to like try and make it look like exactly the way laser bot
00:07:06 draws.
00:07:07 So I just drew it like the way I would draw.
00:07:09 I was like, fuck it.
00:07:10 Yeah.
00:07:11 Um, although I maintained the, um, the, like the shape, the shape of the text boxes and
00:07:15 the formatting of the text boxes and like the fonts used for the text.
00:07:19 I used all that the same way, but, um, the drawings are just the way that I would do
00:07:26 it.
00:07:27 And, uh, um, I'm very, I'm very, I'm very pleased.
00:07:31 I can't wait.
00:07:32 I can't wait for it to go on the website and, uh, I'll be famous finally.
00:07:38 Yeah.
00:07:39 Yeah.
00:07:40 Uh, so that's pretty exciting.
00:07:42 Nice.
00:07:43 That was most of my week.
00:07:45 Yeah.
00:07:46 Although I'm, I'm now behind on the book formatting.
00:07:49 Uh, I've still got a lot, still got a lot to do, uh, with like making the, making the
00:07:55 phantoms revenge scenes into pages for the book is what I got to get back to and do for
00:08:01 the rest of this week.
00:08:02 I guess hopefully I can finish that soon.
00:08:05 What's she been up to?
00:08:08 Um, what I, well, I don't, what I might mostly been up to is playing Elden Ring on stream
00:08:14 still.
00:08:15 Oh yeah.
00:08:16 Oh yeah.
00:08:17 Uh, Elden Ring twitch.tv slash Gibbon take if you want to watch.
00:08:21 Oh.
00:08:22 I've been doing a whole lot of stuff, um, and refusing to go to the first major dungeon
00:08:29 and I've explored many, many, many optional areas and it's, it's very fun.
00:08:35 Hmm.
00:08:36 Uh, how far through the game do you think you are?
00:08:40 It's hard to say at all because you haven't gone to the first dungeon.
00:08:44 Well, you can skip round the first major dungeon with the first main story bus and once you
00:08:51 do that, there's a whole like northern area that you can explore and like there's I, I
00:08:59 don't think I can count the number of like little dungeons and little bosses in little
00:09:04 areas tucked away all over the map and it's just sort of like, oh, I go from here to there
00:09:09 and I'm like, oh, there's something distracts me and I get distracted.
00:09:12 I go and fight a bunch of enemies and they're in like standing around some ruins and there's
00:09:17 like a little, uh, you know, hidden staircase down into a place with a treasure chest.
00:09:23 Sometimes it's a staircase down to a dungeon and sometimes those dungeons have bosses most
00:09:28 of the time they do and so I've just sort of been exploring the map, like getting like
00:09:34 the graces, which is like the bonfires and I can teleport to a grace.
00:09:38 So like, I've got like all of these points all over the whole map that I can teleport
00:09:44 to and then explore from there, like, oh, I haven't gone to this little corner, I haven't
00:09:48 gone to this coastline here, I haven't like checked out this weird thing that looks like
00:09:53 a, looks like a hill with a, with a thing on it.
00:09:57 And so I just have been doing that over and over and over and over and over and it's very
00:10:00 good.
00:10:01 Hmm.
00:10:02 Hmm.
00:10:03 Hmm.
00:10:04 Fascinating.
00:10:05 Give the game a ranking, rank it out of 10 right now.
00:10:11 Um, gosh, I don't do 10 rankings.
00:10:15 Too late!
00:10:16 Uh.
00:10:17 Now I gotta choose.
00:10:18 It's a four.
00:10:19 It's just not that good.
00:10:20 Oh, okay.
00:10:21 Sorry.
00:10:22 I hate this game.
00:10:23 Sorry.
00:10:24 I don't care if you're enjoying it.
00:10:25 Um, yeah, I don't know.
00:10:26 I feel like the combat is like probably the most freeing, feeling combat in any of the
00:10:32 Souls games, the amount of like the freedom you have to play in a certain way.
00:10:39 And then the horse combat is like the funnest thing ever.
00:10:41 It's like, really?
00:10:43 Like you can, sometimes there are enemies on horseback and you can ride by them and
00:10:47 like a normal attack with R1 or L1 will like swing your weapon like quickly, like a little
00:10:55 quick slice.
00:10:56 So you run past them, you slice them and you get them.
00:10:59 Um, but you can do like a power attack L2 or R2 and the LOR is like which direction
00:11:06 of the horse you're attacking from the horse.
00:11:09 And then if you do it like a power attack, you can hold it and they sort of hold their
00:11:13 weapon down low.
00:11:15 And then at the end of a certain time, they'd like swing up and it's a big attack.
00:11:19 But you can do that to like, you can hold like a halberd or something and do a power
00:11:23 attack and run past a bunch of enemies and it'll just hit all of them.
00:11:26 You go...
00:11:27 So that's, that's a very fun and the horse double jumps and it's, it's very manoeuvrable
00:11:36 It's great.
00:11:37 Good horse.
00:11:38 Good horse.
00:11:41 Well, I, on the other hand, despise video games and I would never, and I would never
00:11:48 play one.
00:11:50 I have not been playing much Hades.
00:11:51 I have not made a lot of progress, although I'm getting pretty close to finishing the
00:11:56 fated list of minor prophecies.
00:11:57 I've only got like six of them left and I finished, I finished like the most annoying
00:12:03 one, which is to, I think to get every, every combo boon, like every boon that is like,
00:12:11 okay, you need one from Dionysus and one from Aphrodite and if you have them, then
00:12:15 you can get this other one that's sort of like, sort of a buff to both of their things.
00:12:20 I managed to get every combo boon, which is very, very hard to do.
00:12:24 I have some other random ones left.
00:12:28 Oh, you know what I want to mention?
00:12:31 MarinPan has, was asking, and I think we should do it.
00:12:36 He wanted us to shout out, he wanted us to mention again and remind everybody that the
00:12:40 PCP Minecraft server, if you are a PCP patron, you have access to the Minecraft server and
00:12:47 if you have any trouble getting in there, you should find MarinPan on Discord.
00:12:52 He will help you out.
00:12:55 And I think he wanted to say, he wanted me to shout out the Pokemon League in the Minecraft
00:13:02 server.
00:13:03 There's a whole, there's like a league, you know, they do once in a while, they do, yeah,
00:13:06 yeah, they do tournaments of like, yeah, stuff you caught.
00:13:10 Wait, tournament?
00:13:11 Well, they've done them before.
00:13:12 I thought they were talking about like, the gym battles, like you have like Major's Gym
00:13:17 and your Gym in Copkill Town.
00:13:19 There is, yeah, there is that, there is the whole like, have we like really mentioned
00:13:24 before that there's sort of like a whole like, set of challenges in there?
00:13:28 There's sort of like, there's almost like a whole like, single player campaign.
00:13:32 Yeah, yeah, there's a Pokemon video game built around the buildings that we make or
00:13:38 MarinPan makes in the world.
00:13:40 Mostly MarinPan makes them.
00:13:42 If you, if you catch the streams, you would know.
00:13:45 If you don't, then you wouldn't know.
00:13:47 So probably most people don't know, but yeah, there is, there are whole, there are big like,
00:13:53 Major's Gyms in there to battle through with your team.
00:13:55 There's Major's Gym was the first one.
00:13:57 There's like, there's like, St. Ben's Cathedral in Copkill Town.
00:14:02 There was, there's like that Graveyard one, that like the Tomb of the PCP.
00:14:09 Oh yeah.
00:14:11 There was some, there was one, there was other ones, I think, but there's like a whole, there's
00:14:16 like side quests and stuff.
00:14:17 MarinPan has like, crafted a whole like, a whole like, a video game, a sort of a whole
00:14:23 video game in there.
00:14:25 Yeah.
00:14:26 Sort of a whole, sort of a whole little Pokemon region.
00:14:29 I mean, you know, yeah, I mean, you know, that's not, I mean, I mean, more is being
00:14:34 made all the time.
00:14:35 As much as you could do that, I think the, yeah, but there's areas, there's like themed
00:14:39 areas and stuff.
00:14:40 It's great.
00:14:41 It's wild.
00:14:42 And probably most people don't know about that because most people don't watch the
00:14:43 streams, but it's true.
00:14:46 Yeah.
00:14:47 There's a lot.
00:14:48 MarinPan has done a huge amount of content, like genuine content.
00:14:52 Is it there?
00:14:53 Yeah.
00:14:54 The entirety or like soon to like, very nearly the entirety to scale, basically, of, of Nalacacum,
00:15:02 New Los Angeles city, aka New Milwaukee, is in the server.
00:15:07 It's just a place you can go and it's like the shape of, you know, the actual map.
00:15:11 The map is down.
00:15:13 The map is down.
00:15:14 Not every region is full of like buildings.
00:15:17 There's so many regions that are full.
00:15:19 There are.
00:15:20 It's, it's, some areas are so rich that actually lags a bit.
00:15:25 The downtown area and Copkilt, yeah, a lot of like the, the more central regions are
00:15:30 like fully built and fleshed out.
00:15:32 And yeah, Rowdy Rough House can be a little tough on your, on your PC performance.
00:15:38 And like, you know, oh, and the, oh, the Rowdy Quest, the, the, the, the, the, what was it
00:15:42 called?
00:15:43 The Rowdy Marble Quest.
00:15:44 Yeah.
00:15:45 Rough House stuck.
00:15:46 Yeah.
00:15:47 The Rough House stuck based on that, that RFCK comic by Forks.
00:15:50 There's a whole quest where you have to find all of the realist rowdies and battle them
00:15:54 for their magic marbles and get into the, the, the Rough House.
00:15:59 That's a whole, that took me like, took me like weeks.
00:16:05 We don't talk about it on the show that much.
00:16:06 We usually leave it for the streams, but Marin wanted me to mention it and it does in fact
00:16:11 bear mention it.
00:16:12 We should mention it more.
00:16:13 Mm-hmm.
00:16:14 Mm-hmm.
00:16:15 So if you're a PCP patron of five dollars or more, you get access to the server at no
00:16:21 extra cost.
00:16:22 It used to be a separate patron.
00:16:24 If you weren't aware, it's just in the, the procrastinator's patron now.
00:16:28 No, we, we combined it.
00:16:30 So I should say this, this week, this week, uh, I, I am going to, uh, I'm gonna get those
00:16:38 bonus episodes that Marin, not Marin, Eleazar made weeks and weeks ago that I never posted
00:16:44 and I'm gonna, I'm gonna post them this week.
00:16:47 Um, I will also attempt, I don't, I can't promise it because there may be technical
00:16:53 issues that I don't know about.
00:16:54 I can't promise this, but I will, I will, I will make my best effort to actually get
00:17:00 the old episodes up on like Spotify and Apple podcasts and, and whatever.
00:17:06 Uh, I will use Tom's instructions to figure out, uh, all that.
00:17:11 Uh, also the final thing I want to say about the Patreon, you know what I'm gonna say.
00:17:17 Oh yeah.
00:17:18 Yeah.
00:17:19 This is a terrible situation.
00:17:20 Terrible.
00:17:21 It sucks so much.
00:17:23 But everybody who's been a patron, everyone who's been a patron got it for free for the
00:17:29 last month because we all simply forgot to, uh, post and monetize our usual.
00:17:38 It's not that I forgot, it's just like it's a, it's a part of the presses that I'm never
00:17:42 involved in.
00:17:43 I just assumed that you were doing it or whatever.
00:17:46 Yeah.
00:17:47 You, you never were involved in it.
00:17:49 It was technically Tom's job, although Tom's, Tom simply stopped doing it without saying
00:17:55 anything a while ago and I did do it a couple times, like thinking like, oh, Tom just forgot
00:18:01 this week.
00:18:02 I, I guess I'll do it.
00:18:03 I guess I'll, I'll back him up.
00:18:05 And then I forgot that, um, and then I forgot that it had to, it had to continue to be done.
00:18:10 Uh, so, and then it didn't, we didn't get money for the entire month of March and a little
00:18:17 bit of February.
00:18:19 We charge per episode and we have to post it as a charge thing in order for it to count.
00:18:24 So nothing was charged for March.
00:18:26 So that's, so that's quite a bit of money, uh, that we've lost.
00:18:29 Terrible.
00:18:30 We missed out on our whole months.
00:18:31 Hey, our loss is the patron's gain, so, uh, you know, you're welcome, everybody.
00:18:36 Uh, yeah.
00:18:38 That means you have to double your pledge now.
00:18:40 I, I, I would say, I wouldn't say that you have to, but I would say that if you don't,
00:18:46 you're a bad person.
00:18:47 So there you go.
00:18:50 Uh, but I will put, I will put those, those unreleased, uh, bonus, um, what do we call
00:18:56 the ones that are just like, uh, off, off air banter behind the scenes?
00:19:01 Behind this, I guess the behind the scenes, I didn't know there was a main for them.
00:19:04 I don't, I think I call them behind the scenes.
00:19:06 I'm pretty sure Eleazar made two of them and they've just been sitting there and just
00:19:09 haven't posted them.
00:19:10 I will actually go and post them, uh, this week.
00:19:14 This week I'm going to do it for real.
00:19:16 Like before, like before this episode is out, so they will be out when this episode goes
00:19:19 live.
00:19:20 Um, so everybody's got homework.
00:19:23 You got, you got to go this week.
00:19:24 You got to go check out my tails gets trolled page.
00:19:27 You got to check out the bonus episodes.
00:19:29 You got to pledge to patreon.com slash the procrastinators and get on that Minecraft
00:19:34 server and build a house and get on the Minecraft server, assemble, get in Pixelmon, assemble
00:19:39 a team, challenge, challenge me in cop kill town.
00:19:43 I will destroy you.
00:19:46 Um, I, uh, the cop kill town, which was really hard.
00:19:51 There were a couple of like gimmick fights in there that had like a like a single like
00:19:56 hunt, like level hundred and fifty legendary or something, like a great or edgy gigas or
00:20:00 whatever.
00:20:01 That's like, I just don't have the stats for it.
00:20:04 Um, yeah.
00:20:05 The Pokemon's actually quite like a serious Pokemon stuff.
00:20:09 It's not casual and therefore I have not tried it.
00:20:13 I enjoy catching the Pokemon and looking at them and finding like a really big or a really
00:20:18 small version of a thing.
00:20:19 I, I have a team in there that has gotten me through most things.
00:20:23 Sometimes I have to fuck around with it to deal with something or other, but most of
00:20:26 the time my team can, can meet, uh, Marin's challenges, uh, it's a lot of fun and it's,
00:20:34 and I mean, we've been doing it for like, for like years now, I guess, like every, you
00:20:38 know, we don't stream that often, but I mean, it's been an ongoing thing where often when
00:20:43 we stream, Marin has made some new, some new bullshit for us to cope with.
00:20:51 Some new bullshit for us to gore cat and scope out.
00:20:55 Some new nonsense, some new nonsense to vex us.
00:20:59 Yeah.
00:21:00 Um, shout outs to Marin for everything he's done.
00:21:03 Yeah.
00:21:04 That's really incredible work.
00:21:05 Uh, just a huge amount of time and expertise has gone into it.
00:21:10 I don't know how he does it.
00:21:11 I really don't.
00:21:12 Um, hey, let me check it out.
00:21:14 Yeah.
00:21:15 So just, so just check it out.
00:21:16 Check.
00:21:17 So just go to www.nfl.com and just check it out.
00:21:24 Uh, I've got a thing to say.
00:21:27 Yeah, please.
00:21:28 Um, all right.
00:21:29 So Lord of Ghosts, there's like 13, 15 or so more packages I can send.
00:21:36 Uh, it's beneficial that I send because they're all going to America or Australia and I can
00:21:42 send those, uh, through Transglobal Express all in one big collection and, uh, that's
00:21:48 better for me if I can do it all at once.
00:21:50 There's a few people who still have not, even though I've emailed them directly, still
00:21:54 not responded about their address.
00:21:57 So I'm just going to read out their names.
00:21:59 I'm going to dox them, uh, hopefully they, they either they like think they've done it
00:22:04 and don't realize, um, or they, I don't know if they'll listen to the podcast, maybe they're
00:22:09 just not paying attention to anything.
00:22:12 They might not be.
00:22:13 This is my last, this is my last attempt after this episode goes live for a few days.
00:22:18 I will then send the last big batch of Lord of Ghosts.
00:22:20 And if you're not in that, if you haven't given me your address, I just, I can't do anything
00:22:24 about it.
00:22:25 Um, so.
00:22:27 Your package goes in the bonfire goes in, I'm going to burn it live on stream, uh, including
00:22:33 the plush, which will be terrible, terrible and sad.
00:22:37 You don't want that happen.
00:22:38 Um, okay.
00:22:39 So here, here's the list of, of, of names, uh, Mimi Menzies, O-R-N-O-R-I-N, Panda Pop
00:22:47 Loin, Xtreme, Dag Zagals, James Gottwig, Adam O'Donnell, D dot S, Chromel, R-H-O-M-E-L-L,
00:23:02 James Dollar and Milo Rocks.
00:23:05 Uh, I could put an image actually as well as well.
00:23:08 Um, get your things in because I, I want to give you your, your free shit that you paid
00:23:15 for.
00:23:16 I want you to have the thing you, you, you gave me money for.
00:23:20 I want you to have it.
00:23:22 Yeah.
00:23:23 There were, there were, there were not too many, but there were a few people who, who
00:23:27 just simply never got me there, like info from the Vapors Kickstarter, uh, for, for whatever
00:23:34 reason.
00:23:35 Uh, um, yeah, that happens.
00:23:38 Um, but yeah, I hope everyone gets their fucking shit together.
00:23:44 But yeah, that'll be the ending of the Lord of Ghost thing, uh, hopefully, and then I
00:23:49 can, the, the, the next thing I'm going to be working on is Pumpkin Alley.
00:23:56 And I want to like, I want to do like a, a lot of pre-production before I can, I can
00:24:03 like figure out the, the possible cost of making the game.
00:24:08 And then I'll make a Kickstarter once I know that.
00:24:11 So the pre-production is going to be like, I guess, like thinking about all the levels,
00:24:16 what they will require in terms of number of assets, number of enemies, uh, you know,
00:24:24 game mechanics, and then like making a lot of, like an, an exhaustive list of everything
00:24:30 I would need.
00:24:32 And then, I don't know, ballparking figures of like time it would take to make all of
00:24:37 those assets, uh, for various people and, uh, hourly rates.
00:24:44 So I can figure out like, what's, what's good money for this, this amount of work?
00:24:49 Mostly it's going to be me and Charlie, um, working on it.
00:24:53 So I'll, I just have to ask him, but yeah, Pumpkin Alley pre-production.
00:24:58 And then at some point, Clarissa Gunsmoke, I want to finish, uh, the, the Clarissa Gunsmoke
00:25:05 and the Bandit King.
00:25:06 I want to finish that and make it a real finished thing and maybe even look into like
00:25:10 going to a publisher and saying, Hey, I got a Western cowgirl comic.
00:25:15 What do you think?
00:25:15 You think you can put this on store shelves?
00:25:20 Man, if you figure out how to get a publisher to distribute your book, fucking tell me how
00:25:26 you did it.
00:25:27 I, yeah, I mean, I have, I don't know.
00:25:31 I don't have like, like connections, but I do have some good recommendations of
00:25:36 publishers I could look into.
00:25:38 So I'm just going to, I'm just going to finish the, the, the Bandit King and then
00:25:43 send it out to people and say, what do you think?
00:25:47 And then they say it sucks.
00:25:48 But you got, you got, uh, I like your moxie, but yeah, but yeah, but you got
00:25:52 gumption kid will give you a chance.
00:25:56 And then the Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Bandit King will be like the pilot and then
00:26:00 I'll make a better version.
00:26:02 Hmm.
00:26:04 Yeah.
00:26:04 I don't know really what to do with that other than like, it was, it was a cool
00:26:08 idea and I liked the, the character and I want to continue it.
00:26:13 So I will.
00:26:15 Wait, what do you mean you make a better version?
00:26:17 Um, well, you know how like, uh, there's a, the, the pilot version of a thing is
00:26:22 like different and then, uh, if you get a publisher or, or like, uh, people, they'll
00:26:28 say, uh, well, we suggest you do this and that.
00:26:31 And are you talking about like serializing it?
00:26:35 And potentially, I mean, it's a Western.
00:26:38 You could do loads of things with it.
00:26:39 Yeah.
00:26:41 Hmm.
00:26:42 Cause initially for, for a while I was like thinking, Oh, I'm, I'm never going to
00:26:46 get published.
00:26:46 I'm just like an internet content creator.
00:26:49 I'm just going to draw some things and post them online and get some likes and
00:26:52 hopefully some patrons in this.
00:26:54 That's going to be me.
00:26:55 That's all I can do.
00:26:57 Um, but I got some feedback about it.
00:27:01 Some of my dad's friends were like saying my dad showed it to them and they were
00:27:06 like, Oh, this is really cool.
00:27:08 You should, you should look into getting it published.
00:27:09 I'm like, really?
00:27:11 This is interesting to me actually.
00:27:14 You serious?
00:27:15 You, you're giving me like good vibes on this that I made.
00:27:18 That's nice.
00:27:20 No, no, there's a thought.
00:27:21 Are you telling me that are you telling me that are you telling me that
00:27:25 organized business structures exist for the purpose of creation and distribution
00:27:32 of an artist's output?
00:27:35 Is that what you're saying?
00:27:37 It's, it's more that they thought you fucking with me.
00:27:41 I just felt validated.
00:27:42 You know, like I felt validated that a human being that wasn't online said that
00:27:46 what I drew on was cool and should be made real.
00:27:49 And I'm like, wow, I never really thought about it for some reason.
00:27:52 Sure.
00:27:53 And they're probably right.
00:27:55 I just, that's a thing.
00:27:58 I don't know.
00:27:58 I just, I guess I never really, that's a thing that I thought about.
00:28:02 And I sort of immediately dismissed as like, well, that'll never work.
00:28:05 Like that, that's impossible.
00:28:06 But, but like, well, I don't know why I, that I may, that may be a limiting
00:28:10 belief that I have that now that you say it out loud, that makes me think like,
00:28:15 that is a good idea.
00:28:16 Could I do that?
00:28:17 How would I do that?
00:28:19 I mean, the way you've done probably so far is
00:28:22 like it's, it's a new way to do comics is to crowdfund the printing of them
00:28:28 and then send them out and it's doable on a small scale.
00:28:33 But if you could get a publisher, so much of that hassle of logistics
00:28:37 and buying and selling and marketing is like taken care of and you can just work.
00:28:42 This is like, this is like, yeah, exactly.
00:28:45 Like when I, when I went around to comic shops to, to ask them like,
00:28:49 hey, would you like to put my book on your shelf?
00:28:51 Some of them were like, yeah, sure, I'll take three copies.
00:28:54 What do you want?
00:28:54 Like, what do you want?
00:28:55 Like $2 for each?
00:28:57 I'm like, yeah.
00:29:01 It's like, well, what's literally not worth the fucking bus fare to like get out
00:29:06 here and ask you in person if you want.
00:29:08 Yeah, they would give me like, they would give me like $3 for each copy
00:29:12 and with the intent to like sell it for five.
00:29:15 I'm like, well, it's simply not worth, it's simply not worth my time.
00:29:20 The only way it would be worth it is if I had a distributor, like if Diamond
00:29:26 distributor were putting my shit in a catalog and like hundreds of stores
00:29:30 were looking at that and being like, yeah, I'll take a copy.
00:29:32 I'll take two copies, whatever.
00:29:34 I'll take 50.
00:29:36 Sure.
00:29:36 Well, sure.
00:29:38 They just, well, they just don't want to, they don't want to stock that many,
00:29:42 especially of an unknown thing.
00:29:45 Yeah, they want to put, they want like one copy, put it on the shelf.
00:29:48 And if it, if someone buys it, like, well, I guess I'll get another one.
00:29:51 Maybe someone will buy that, you know.
00:29:55 So you got to work at scale and I just lack that ability.
00:29:59 So I just gave up.
00:30:00 I was like, well, I guess I'm only selling my shit online.
00:30:06 You know what I got to diversify that portfolio.
00:30:09 Yeah.
00:30:10 What I thought, what I've been thinking occasionally is that I should get an agent.
00:30:14 You know, that's a thing that artists do sometimes.
00:30:17 They get, they get an agent.
00:30:19 What does that mean?
00:30:21 Well, what I understand is that an agent is someone who basically knows people in the industry.
00:30:30 You don't, you don't pay them to be your agent.
00:30:32 What they do is they take a, a good day.
00:30:34 Like there are some fake agents that will scam you and ask for money up front, but those are fake.
00:30:40 A real agent will just basically knows people and knows the industry.
00:30:45 And when a job comes up and someone's looking for someone, they might be like, Oh, I know a guy.
00:30:51 And then they'll call you and be like, Hey, here's a job I thought you might be good at.
00:30:54 Would you want this job?
00:30:56 And then you go, yes.
00:30:57 And then they take like a, I don't know, 15% cut or whatever of the pay for that job.
00:31:04 So that's what an agent does.
00:31:05 Just they know talent and they know people that are looking for talent and they connect them.
00:31:11 And I'm like, Hey, I'm talent.
00:31:13 I flatter myself to think.
00:31:16 Uh, so it was like, I, I guess sounds like something I should have, uh, but apparently, you know, there's a lot to, that goes into like picking the right agent or whatever.
00:31:27 Like I haven't even really looked at all.
00:31:30 It's just something that sometimes I think I should probably get an agent.
00:31:36 Cause I mean, how would you go for that?
00:31:37 Like agents.com.
00:31:40 Great, great question.
00:31:42 Great question.
00:31:43 I have no idea.
00:31:45 I feel like you'd need to go in person to like a comic thing and then like hold a glass of champagne at an after party and say, Yeah, I'm a comic person.
00:31:55 Oh, you should talk to X, Y, Z.
00:31:58 And I'm like, Oh, okay.
00:31:59 Now I have to do this, like all of that socializing.
00:32:03 Then you, you might look around and find the perfect person.
00:32:07 And that's it.
00:32:08 Yeah, I have no idea.
00:32:10 I think that's probably not how it's typically done.
00:32:13 I can't imagine.
00:32:15 I can't imagine most people, uh, could really get much out of something like that.
00:32:20 No, there probably are just like, there probably are just like listings and maybe you can like check out an individual agent or like, or not.
00:32:29 Or you wouldn't, you wouldn't have an agent, like an individual agent.
00:32:32 You would probably apply to an agency and maybe they would assign you an agent that works for their agency.
00:32:39 Right.
00:32:40 Maybe you might have one dude and like, you're his responsibility or you go on his list or whatever.
00:32:47 Yeah, I don't know.
00:32:49 I don't really know how it works, but it seems like something I should have or should, I should look into getting.
00:32:57 I would like, I would like to, I would like to do work.
00:33:02 I would like to do productive work in my, in my field.
00:33:06 Sounds good.
00:33:08 It'd be cool just to like, I don't know, transcend from my shitty website that I made that sucks.
00:33:17 Sure.
00:33:18 And put it into places where I can get a little bit of money all the time.
00:33:22 Well, I don't actually know how that works, but like, the, like, I'm not generating any revenue from my comics at the moment.
00:33:32 Yeah, I get Patreon money and people like what I make.
00:33:36 And so they patron me, but like that's, there's no like direct link and I don't know if more comics is more better.
00:33:46 I like drawing them, so I'm going to keep doing that.
00:33:48 But God, I got to get money, got to get cash, you know.
00:33:55 I believe me, believe me, I know, I know about the need for cash.
00:34:02 Uh, I was telling, so I went, so I did Easter, right?
00:34:08 This, the Sunday was Easter.
00:34:09 So yesterday I went to a little, a little family get together with my parents and some of my, some of my mom's sisters and their husbands and talk to some of those guys that I haven't seen in a long time.
00:34:25 And I was telling one, one of them was asking what I've been up to and I started, I didn't go into huge detail about it, but I talked about Slime and Punishment and like how I'd been, I'd drawn this comic and I was hoping to kick, hoping to crowdfund and print it and make, distribute it soon.
00:34:45 And I mentioned that I had made a, I had mentioned that I had made a game that I had sort of like dipped my toe into game development and made a little game to go along with the comic.
00:34:54 And this aunt told me something that, that astounded me.
00:35:01 By the way, this is, this is not career talk, by the way, this is just an anecdote.
00:35:05 So I'm sorry if I changed the subject out from under you, if you wanted to talk about more.
00:35:09 Um, no, I can, I can talk afterwards.
00:35:12 Okay.
00:35:13 Sorry.
00:35:13 Um, but, but the, they told me she was like, Oh, that reminds me.
00:35:19 And she said, so I had this aunt, I had this aunt that died, like right around the time that I was born, this aunt died, she was like 30 and she died of leukemia.
00:35:30 And apparently, like before she died, she had made a little game, and this would have been in like the late eighties, she had programmed a little like game for her, for her boyfriend and this boyfriend was still like a friend of the family.
00:35:47 He still occasionally shows up to family functions.
00:35:50 She had made a little like choose your own adventure or a little like click through pages as like a Valentine's Day present for this boyfriend.
00:35:58 Yeah.
00:35:58 That's cute.
00:35:59 Yeah.
00:36:00 I was like, that's the cutest thing I ever heard.
00:36:02 And also you telling me a woman made a video game in the eight, in the eighties.
00:36:10 I couldn't make a video game in the eighties.
00:36:13 I mean, you weren't a born.
00:36:15 I know, I guess I feel I feel like you would have to be, I feel like you would have to be a somewhat serious like computer person.
00:36:25 Oh, you mean like in the eighties, most people didn't know what computers were.
00:36:28 Yeah, yeah.
00:36:29 Yeah, like today I was like, I feel like an idiot because I boot up Game Maker and like, yeah, there's tools there that I can like use to sort of design a game, but it's all shit that someone made for me, like I'm not, I'm not doing anything novel.
00:36:42 I'm just using shit that someone like laid out for for an idiot like me to use.
00:36:46 I feel like to do that in the eighties, you would have to like, I don't know, you would have to like put your own circuit board.
00:36:53 You have to build your own circuit board with resistors on a little cork board and like put the transistors together.
00:36:58 I don't know about quite that, but yeah, it's definitely more difficult.
00:37:04 I remember seeing like sketches of like Super Mario Brothers where they drew like a grid with pencil on paper and like, okay, we're going to have a, it looks like this.
00:37:19 And it's got the, they have to type in code what the squares look like and what color they are.
00:37:25 Yeah.
00:37:25 And it's like, wow, you can't just draw with a mouse.
00:37:28 What's a mouse?
00:37:28 They said.
00:37:30 Nothing.
00:37:31 It ain't nothing.
00:37:32 No such thing.
00:37:34 So anyway, I just thought that was a very cute little story, cute little, cute little thing surprised me a lot.
00:37:44 But it was true.
00:37:45 Anyway, were we talking about publishing?
00:37:50 Publishing.
00:37:50 Yeah.
00:37:50 Well, I mean, I guess the only other thing was that like my thought process of like how I'm going to to juggle pumpkin alley and Clarissa.
00:38:04 Cause I want to get both of them done.
00:38:05 So I'm going to have to like seriously manage my time in the coming months, very, very sensibly and very deliberately in order to get the stuff done.
00:38:17 I don't want to get burnt out on anything.
00:38:19 I don't want to work myself to the bone so that I can't do either thing.
00:38:23 And I don't want to leave one thing for like seven months in the future.
00:38:26 I want to be getting them done at the same time.
00:38:30 Yeah.
00:38:32 And I'm not sure how that's going to work quite yet.
00:38:36 I guess I just like designate a certain day for like this or that.
00:38:40 So you're saying, so you're talking about on the one hand, doing like the pre-production stuff for, for pumpkin alley, like in preparation for like kickstarting the full game and also completing the Clarissa comic, right?
00:38:58 Yeah.
00:38:58 Or no, wait.
00:38:58 Clarissa Gunsmoke.
00:38:59 You, did you, did you finish that?
00:39:02 I posted what I had done for the Tezuka award thing, which was not the finished thing at the very end of that.
00:39:11 She's in prison.
00:39:12 I had written more and I had sketched like, like 35 pages after that, but I hadn't like lined them or anything.
00:39:20 I guess I blocked them out.
00:39:21 I didn't really sketch them, but there's like a bunch of pages left to go that I haven't drawn.
00:39:29 And I, I would love it to be finished because I think it's very cool how it ends, like epic.
00:39:36 You might say like, like a showdown.
00:39:39 And then I would, oh, oh, I see how it is.
00:39:44 And, you know, it's just like, oh, what a great thing that nobody fucking knows at all.
00:39:52 I feel like people have sort of forgotten that I drew Clarissa Gunsmoke.
00:39:55 And they don't, it's just sort of like, oh, yeah, yeah, that thing.
00:39:59 No, it's my best thing.
00:40:00 It's my best work, but you haven't seen it yet.
00:40:04 So, but that would take like not so much thinking time, at least for the pages that I've already sketched.
00:40:16 I've got to, I've just got to block it out because like there's, there's, there's two types of work.
00:40:22 One's a lot, it depends on who you are, but one is more difficult than the other for me.
00:40:28 There's the creative work where you come up with everything.
00:40:32 And then there's the, the, the labor where you, yeah, like you zone out and you just physically move your hand around and do it.
00:40:40 Yeah.
00:40:41 And so I need some blocks of like creative work to, to like think how is this page going to be laid out for the rest of the pages?
00:40:49 And then the labor is just sitting down for like six hours and just drawing.
00:40:55 Yeah.
00:40:56 And so I want to make it so that I'm not, and then Pumpkin Alley is like a lot of creative work for the pre-production.
00:41:05 That's entirely creative work.
00:41:06 I'm coming up with everything.
00:41:09 So I, I don't want to be flip-flopping between creative and labor work too much because then it's like you get,
00:41:18 you get like momentum doing one type of work.
00:41:21 I think creative work is just harder in general.
00:41:23 It takes more brain cells, neurons to fire.
00:41:28 Yeah, I agree.
00:41:29 It's more like, yeah, like the grunt work, the like just the busy work, you can kind of just like chug away at it.
00:41:39 And it's like, yeah, whatever.
00:41:42 So I think what I want is I want to be in a position where I've done the creative work for Clarissa Gunsmoke.
00:41:49 So that I can, I can, I don't know, I can do like the labor work for Clarissa Gunsmoke on one day and then the next day,
00:42:02 creative work for Pumpkin Alley or just creative work the whole time.
00:42:06 I don't really know how to properly do it.
00:42:10 I've got to look at a calendar and be like, put everything on the calendar and then say,
00:42:17 I'm going to do that on this day, hopefully.
00:42:22 It's difficult scheduling things.
00:42:26 How does one organize one's life?
00:42:28 There's like 700,000 apps for organization.
00:42:33 And I know why, because it's hard.
00:42:37 I those are both two like really long term projects.
00:42:40 And I understand why you would want to be like, well, I kind of want to be making progress on both at once.
00:42:48 I'm trying to, I don't have any, I don't have anything that's like that long term, like that I'm going to be working on for like a whole year,
00:42:54 like like Pumpkin Alley or whatever.
00:42:57 But or not not pump.
00:42:58 Yeah, yeah, Pumpkin Alley.
00:43:00 I'm really trying to just be like, I have a bunch of ideas for things that I should be doing.
00:43:07 I have a bunch of like plans that I've been coming up with that maybe I'll do in the next year.
00:43:13 But I'm really trying to just like cut down and focus on one thing at a time.
00:43:18 Like I was just doing the book.
00:43:20 I was like, not worried about anything else, just finishing the book.
00:43:23 But then the Tales of Gets Trolled page was like, I kind of, I have to do that now.
00:43:27 Like that can't wait.
00:43:28 So it's like, OK, I'm not working on the book at all this week.
00:43:31 I'm only doing the Tales of Gets Trolled page.
00:43:33 Now that's done.
00:43:34 So this week it's going to be just, just the book.
00:43:37 Well, except for, you know, I have to put those fucking podcast episodes up.
00:43:42 I can't wait. So I will have to do that.
00:43:43 But other than that, it'll be only the book and then it'll be just, just the book until that's done.
00:43:48 And then, like I said, I have some, I have some, I came up with some, not a scheme.
00:43:56 I came up with some, an idea and, and how do I want to say it?
00:44:03 I had an idea, I had an idea that I need to somewhat change the approach that I'm using
00:44:10 to my, my online presence, because I feel like I've been mostly just spinning my wheels
00:44:15 for the last, maybe a couple of years even.
00:44:18 And I think I need a new strategy.
00:44:21 And I think I've come up with some ideas for how to do that.
00:44:23 But I don't want to say what they are, but I'm not work, but I'm not.
00:44:26 I don't get it, though.
00:44:28 Yeah. Well, I'm being cagey.
00:44:32 So you mean like your approach to being an online person?
00:44:37 Yes. You're talking about your own like brand of Ben Saint?
00:44:41 Yes.
00:44:42 Okay. I don't know what you're, yeah, I guess I kind of guess.
00:44:47 No, I don't want, I don't want you to know.
00:44:48 I mean, I'll tell you, actually, I will tell you after the show.
00:44:51 I don't want to say it on the show.
00:44:52 Sure, sure.
00:44:53 Because I want, I have some things that I want to do and I think I really should do,
00:44:58 but I don't want to talk about them before they're ready because like, what's the point?
00:45:03 It's, it's, I just like, I was like, this, I don't know.
00:45:07 I have a bit, a little bit of a revelation that sort of hit me like, it's obvious.
00:45:13 Like it's actually kind of obvious.
00:45:15 It's actually kind of obvious what I should have done.
00:45:18 And it's like, well, now that I've thought of it, maybe it wouldn't even be that hard, but.
00:45:25 I've decided to change my name to the Ben guy ever.
00:45:32 Whatever, but anyway, the point is I had that idea, but I'm like, now's not the time.
00:45:37 Now's not the time to worry about it.
00:45:39 Got to finish the book before I think about doing that.
00:45:42 Because I don't want to put the book off anymore.
00:45:45 The book should be done.
00:45:46 And then while the Kickstarter's running, you know, maybe I'll have time to, okay,
00:45:49 maybe I can start like preparing for anything I want to do in relation to any of that stuff.
00:45:59 So yeah, I'm trying to really, I'm trying to really focus on some,
00:46:05 some particulars, but I don't expect anything, I don't expect the book to take more than
00:46:14 maybe like a month.
00:46:16 I would like to have the book ready to go and maybe, maybe I could, maybe I could do
00:46:20 the Kickstarter a month from now, I would, that would be amazing.
00:46:23 I don't know if it's realistic, but I feel like I should try.
00:46:27 Maybe that should be my sort of optimum goal.
00:46:32 Yeah, it's working through creative projects.
00:46:37 I sometimes get lost in like working on the one thing.
00:46:41 And then when somebody says, why do you see yourself in five years?
00:46:45 Like that sort of a question.
00:46:46 I'm like, I don't fucking know, doing more of it, doing a different one.
00:46:50 Yeah.
00:46:51 It's like, I don't know where I want to end up at all.
00:46:54 It would be nice to be like, oh, I've got a stable income now because of I released a
00:46:58 game and people like it, or like, oh, I got a comic published.
00:47:04 I mean, that would be a great, like end goal, but like a goal, like a big goal to have to
00:47:11 have a goal post to move, and like, but like, I don't know where I want to end up other
00:47:19 than that, sort of, I'm just sort of like, I'm picking one thing that I have in my head
00:47:24 and I'm like, all right, time to make this thing that was in my head for a while, a real
00:47:28 thing.
00:47:30 And there it is.
00:47:32 Then I just pick another one.
00:47:36 I've got, I still in my, in the back of my head, I want to, I want to do more red noir
00:47:41 and I want to tie it into slime and punishment in some funny way.
00:47:44 Oh, that would be sick.
00:47:46 It'd be sick, but it would be like a very big distraction from like bigger things that
00:47:52 are probably more of an importance for me today.
00:47:56 You, I hate to say it, but that's probably true as much as I, no, no, no, actually, actually,
00:48:05 after the show, let's talk about this.
00:48:06 Let me, let me explain to you why actually making, making slime and punishment adjacent
00:48:11 content is probably the most important thing you could be doing for your personal future.
00:48:18 I'd love to know how.
00:48:20 I have some, I have some thoughts about it.
00:48:22 Yeah, I'll share them with you.
00:48:23 I mean, in a way, like the Lord of Ghosts act three, which will also be a thing I'm
00:48:28 going to work on, will, because of all of the things it's like linked to, it will have
00:48:38 to, all right, I don't want to spoil it, but I was thinking the beginning of like the Lord
00:48:44 of Ghosts act three would take place in Nalakakam from the perspective of perhaps red man.
00:48:52 And then, and then the, that everyone will arrive and it'll be like, what the fuck?
00:48:56 And that'll, that'll, that'll be like the act three thing makes, makes perfect sense
00:49:00 to me.
00:49:01 So if red noir is going on, that could also lead into the events of Lord of Ghosts act
00:49:08 three, and it would just be a whole big fucking thing and it's like cool and based and epic
00:49:14 and like, what, wow, they're going to fight, Flowey's going to slice somebody, there's
00:49:20 the army of the dead, what are they going to do?
00:49:24 I have a question, I was, I was watching Oblivionfall, this was, this was after you went to bed
00:49:31 and Oblivion, it did not stream the other day, Oblivionfall played Phantom of Revenge
00:49:36 and, oh yes, after you went to bed, he was continuing to look for that, that elusive
00:49:42 eighth lizard, which he never found tragically, but he, they were looking at, there's that
00:49:50 part near the end of the game, the end of the demo area, where there's a rock on the
00:49:56 side of the hill and it has, it has the flower head triskelion.
00:50:01 Yes.
00:50:02 I was going, and it made me think like, why does, is there a reason, like there's got
00:50:06 to be, like, why does he have that, why does he wear the triskelion?
00:50:10 There is a reason, but I'm not entirely sure what the reason is yet.
00:50:16 I know Flower Head's backstory, I know where he comes from and I know, like, the lore of
00:50:20 that location and the reason he's doing what he's doing.
00:50:25 The symbol is like, what symbol could, like, represent this thing and, like, looking at
00:50:30 things Celtic?
00:50:31 I was like, yeah, that's a cool, that's a cool thing.
00:50:35 Yeah.
00:50:36 The places from, also uses symbols like that, as is the extent of it, it's just, like, finding
00:50:42 a cool thing from the real world that links either thematically or, like, aesthetically
00:50:49 into, like, the fictional world that I'm building.
00:50:53 That makes sense.
00:50:54 I looked it up and I was looking through what it means and it, it had, like, it was like,
00:50:59 it can mean, like, a billion different things and I was like, okay, that doesn't tell me
00:51:03 a whole lot.
00:51:04 Yeah.
00:51:06 It's his, like, backstory iconography or it's related to, like, where he comes from.
00:51:12 That makes sense to me, yeah.
00:51:15 Really it's just that he had, in Canon's story that nobody has read, he just had, like, the
00:51:22 Scorpio sign for no reason.
00:51:25 Scorpio is, is this six and nine?
00:51:28 No, that's cancer.
00:51:29 No, that's cancer.
00:51:30 Scorpio's the VSCO one, the M with the, like, little, little, little, little, little, little,
00:51:35 little.
00:51:36 Tell.
00:51:40 Why did he have that?
00:51:41 Was it a risqué reference?
00:51:43 It was a risqué reference.
00:51:44 Yeah, of course.
00:51:45 It's nothing more than that.
00:51:47 Fair, fair, fair.
00:51:49 Yeah, I always forget Flowerhead was in Canon's story, Lamal.
00:51:55 Um, what are we talking about?
00:51:58 I dunno, just creative projects.
00:52:01 That's all I really had to say is that I want to be working on Clarissa and Pumpkin Alley,
00:52:11 and somehow doing both of those at the same time in a way that doesn't ruin me because
00:52:19 I would hate to postpone either of them, and I can postpone things like Red Noir and
00:52:26 Lord of Ghosts because they're like, what if I could get a published comic, and what
00:52:33 if I could make a real video game, like those are really cool things that I want to focus
00:52:38 on.
00:52:39 After I'm done fucking around with Elden Ring for another like 10 weeks.
00:52:43 Right, of course, of course, priorities.
00:52:47 I have some things that I have been meaning to do that I've wanted to do and I still want
00:52:55 to do for like probably the two most pressing of which would be finishing Beast Capades
00:53:00 and doing another Nuzlocke.
00:53:02 These are things that I've been saying I would do for a long time.
00:53:05 I definitely want to do those things, but you know, I have the thing I'm doing right
00:53:11 now, which is the book, and then I've had this thought about, I've had this thought
00:53:15 about, you know, my how to better, you know, that stuff about my brand and stuff about
00:53:20 like the direction I should be.
00:53:22 I've had some ideas for like how I should be spending my time as a content creator,
00:53:29 and I'm like, I think I should look into that.
00:53:30 I think I should try that for a bit, and I don't think it's going to be like, oh, well
00:53:37 now I can't do any of those other things that I want to do, but I do think I'll have to
00:53:41 be like, alright, I'll need to make one thing like a priority, and then the other things
00:53:46 will have to sort of be fit in around that.
00:53:54 I'm being so cagey.
00:53:55 I'm being so cagey just because like if my ideas don't pan out, then I don't ever have
00:54:02 to acknowledge them ever again, and no one will make fun of me because I said I was going
00:54:07 to do a thing, and then I didn't do a thing.
00:54:09 You're going to make a, you're going to make, you're going to like redraw Sonichu, and you're
00:54:15 going to call it Benichu.
00:54:16 You're going to call it, you're going to horse eat you because it's like horses.
00:54:21 I'm going to do another one of those damn, hey, I redrew Sonichu, but good, I'm going
00:54:26 to start all the way at the beginning, and I'm going to do all like 14 chapters of it,
00:54:30 and I'm sure this time, I'm sure I'll be the one that doesn't get sick of that totally
00:54:35 pointless process, and just the whole thing that makes my whole life.
00:54:42 No, never, never, ever again.
00:54:46 Yeah, I was telling my, that aunt I was telling about slime and punishment.
00:54:50 I was explaining to her like, yeah, I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little unsure
00:54:55 about whether I expect to make any money off it because, you know, it's the whole thing
00:55:00 is sort of like a big in-joke that like is really hard to understand and like nobody
00:55:08 knows what it is and doesn't make any sense, and it's nonsense and it sucks, but I don't
00:55:17 know.
00:55:18 I just got it, but I can't, I can't not sell it.
00:55:20 I can't just be like, eh, well nobody will buy it, eh, won't make any money, eh, fuck
00:55:24 it, I can't, I can't just give up on it.
00:55:26 I have to see it through all the way to the end, just to see what kind of numbers it does,
00:55:32 just to, just so I can tell myself, well, I did my best.
00:55:36 I mean, it's anything you do will probably do more than nothing.
00:55:39 I think, I think, yeah, I think it will sell enough to be made.
00:55:45 I, my, my hope, because I put more time into it than I put into like either of the Vapors
00:55:52 chapters, my, my hope is that it gives me a bigger return on investment for time spent.
00:55:57 My hope is that it makes, you know, proportionally more money than those did, basically.
00:56:01 If it doesn't do that, if it just does similar numbers, I will be like, I will consider
00:56:08 that somewhat of a failure.
00:56:09 But I mean, that still won't, that still won't be nothing.
00:56:11 Like that'll still be worth doing.
00:56:15 Yeah, that's, that's where it's at.
00:56:20 I just want to, I just want to get it done.
00:56:21 I really want to, I got some paper samples.
00:56:25 I got to choose cover weights.
00:56:27 The, I got to choose page, page thicknesses and stuff, pick a printer.
00:56:31 The reality of the situation is that I might have to change printers later on.
00:56:38 Like I might decide on a printer now and then based on the number.
00:56:42 Like if I, if I pick a printer now, I would probably pick the one that is the most cost
00:56:46 effective to print, like the minimum number.
00:56:48 Like if I set my goal, like while I want to sell 100 of them, I'll pick the printer
00:56:52 that's like the cheapest to print 100.
00:56:54 But then, you know, if it were to sell 500 copies, which would be incredible.
00:56:58 But whatever, just for example, if it does that, then I'll be like, well, okay,
00:57:02 actually at that number, there's a different printer that's a more cost
00:57:06 effective price point.
00:57:08 So I should actually switch printed.
00:57:09 So I actually probably shouldn't commit to, I'm definitely going with this printer.
00:57:13 But I want to get at least one test copy made.
00:57:18 And it's like, okay, I can't guarantee this will be the exact, like exact print
00:57:23 quality, the exact, like glossiness, the exact dimensions, but it'll be, it'll
00:57:28 basically be this.
00:57:29 And they're like, okay, this, this is the product being sold.
00:57:32 And that's hard because I got to, got to finish the page layout, got to, got
00:57:37 to pick a printer, got to pick one printer to just to make the test copy with.
00:57:42 And then got to go through whatever process it requires to have that made
00:57:46 and shipped to me.
00:57:47 And then once I have the book in front of me, be like, okay, now.
00:57:51 Also, I think I've been thinking, and I think that the way to do it, I think the
00:57:57 way to market the book is to make a YouTube video.
00:58:01 And I think that the YouTube video, it should be, it should be a Kickstarter
00:58:04 announcement, but maybe even more than a Kickstarter announcement.
00:58:08 It should be a little bit of a explanation of like what it is and like how it happened.
00:58:15 So I think I kind of want to make a little video that's more of like.
00:58:20 A trailer for a book.
00:58:22 It's not, not just a trailer.
00:58:24 I think that the video will sort of be a little story essay video that's like.
00:58:30 Oops, I accidentally made the last chapter of Sonichu.
00:58:33 Here's, here's how it happens.
00:58:36 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:58:37 Yeah, tying it into to that.
00:58:39 And then in that video, I will mention that, like, and it's, and I'm, you know,
00:58:44 I'm selling the book.
00:58:45 If you want to buy the book, I made a Kickstarter.
00:58:47 It's going on right now, but it'll mostly be an explanation of like how it
00:58:50 happened and what it is.
00:58:52 And maybe make, maybe try to make a little funny story out of it.
00:58:55 I think that's, I think that's the move marketing wise.
00:58:59 So that's work.
00:59:00 That's work that I don't want to do, but I guess I got to do it.
00:59:07 Haven't made a video in a while.
00:59:08 Imagine making a video.
00:59:11 Yeah.
00:59:12 Imagine scripting out a video and then editing it together.
00:59:15 Like that's something I haven't done in so long.
00:59:17 And I'm actually like dreading it and terrified of it.
00:59:21 Yeah, I haven't scripted a video in a long time.
00:59:23 I've recorded myself like the most like closest I got to making a video recently
00:59:29 was I recorded myself playing wordles where I couldn't figure out what it was.
00:59:35 And I was going to call it, I can't fucking think of the wordle.
00:59:38 Oh, that's good.
00:59:40 Hey, that's good.
00:59:40 And it, and it's mostly when I do a wordle and I was like, oh, I don't know how to do.
00:59:44 Oh, what the fuck is this?
00:59:46 And it's just like me fumbling around for like maybe five minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
00:59:50 And then I'm like, wait, yeah, I did it.
00:59:54 It's like, wait a minute, that's, that sucks.
00:59:58 I don't want to, I don't want to go to the effort of putting that in a video editor
01:00:02 and then like messing around with it and then rendering it and then uploading it.
01:00:05 I mean, it's a funny, it's a funny joke as a reference to I can't fucking
01:00:10 think of the word.
01:00:11 Yeah.
01:00:12 So I feel like it, I feel like the same thing could have been done.
01:00:16 Like the same content could be made in like tweets.
01:00:21 But the problem with wordle is that you can't post something the day that it's
01:00:25 the wordle you have to wait until afterwards.
01:00:29 And so like, and it's just sort of nobody posts their wordles like old ones.
01:00:34 So I feel like nobody would care in any event what happened.
01:00:39 So I might, I might, I might leave it.
01:00:41 I think it would make an okay little joke video.
01:00:43 I think it'd be fine.
01:00:44 Yeah.
01:00:45 I mean, I've recorded like five or six of them and I'm like, maybe I could put it
01:00:48 all in one big video where I can't fucking think of the word all.
01:00:50 Yeah.
01:00:51 I think that's from, from months ago.
01:00:53 That's good.
01:00:54 I think that's totally fair.
01:00:58 Yeah.
01:00:58 No, no sort of thing you could like, like do to keep up with the times.
01:01:04 It's just sort of some content that might be interesting later.
01:01:07 Sure.
01:01:08 Sure.
01:01:09 And what more can you, what more can you ask for?
01:01:13 Um,
01:01:17 there's a, there's a thing, there's a, there's a funny thing that happened.
01:01:22 I don't know.
01:01:22 I guess I should bring it up.
01:01:24 Oh, I don't, I just don't want to dwell on it too long, but did you see, uh, I
01:01:28 got in like, I got in some stupid Twitter arguments this week.
01:01:33 Oh, which ones?
01:01:34 About the VTuber.
01:01:36 Oh, yeah.
01:01:38 You responded to a VTuber doing some sort of parasocial relationship post.
01:01:44 Yeah, something like that.
01:01:45 And you said, this is disgusting.
01:01:47 And then you refused to elaborate and then muted her.
01:01:51 Yes, that's correct.
01:01:54 Well, I thought it was amusing.
01:01:55 Her fans did not think it was, her fans were angry and were like sending me like
01:02:01 threats and like sending me like gore and stuff.
01:02:03 Yeah, threats are not good.
01:02:05 But I just thought it was like, like, of course, somebody would not know what the
01:02:11 fuck you mean if you don't say anything.
01:02:13 You just say, fuck this.
01:02:14 Okay.
01:02:15 Disgusting.
01:02:16 And it's like, what the hell is that guy's problem?
01:02:18 Like, it's just sort of like a weirdo thing to happen.
01:02:22 Sure.
01:02:23 But like getting threats for it is like, uh, why do you care?
01:02:27 Why do they care?
01:02:28 Those, her fans are the VTuber fans in general fucking suck and I hate them.
01:02:31 I have no respect for them at all, like the hell with all of them.
01:02:34 Like they're, they're devils, they're monsters.
01:02:36 Um, but more, more than that, um, I just, she, you know, I tell, I said, like,
01:02:42 hey, fuck this post.
01:02:43 I, that's not what I said.
01:02:44 I said this post is horrible.
01:02:46 Hate this post.
01:02:47 Horrible.
01:02:48 Hate this post.
01:02:49 I'm hated.
01:02:49 Horrible.
01:02:50 Yeah.
01:02:50 That's it.
01:02:51 Um, and she said, like, why?
01:02:54 And like, I don't know, when I see that, she's like, why do you not like the post?
01:02:59 And I think, and I'm like, I don't know.
01:03:01 I just, I don't, I don't owe you an answer.
01:03:05 I, I already don't like you.
01:03:06 I don't like what you do on here.
01:03:09 And you ask me to do the work of explaining to you why I, I, I feel this way about you.
01:03:16 You don't, you don't deserve that.
01:03:17 I'm kind of offended that you think I would waste my time explaining anything to you.
01:03:24 No, I won't do it.
01:03:26 I refuse.
01:03:28 Um, so that's why I said, no, like I don't, I don't want to explain.
01:03:31 I don't owe you an explanation.
01:03:32 I won't do it.
01:03:33 Um, but yeah.
01:03:37 So she, she was, and then she, she screenshotted these posts and made a little post and was
01:03:42 like, what is he's bullying me?
01:03:45 This, this was like a, this, this girl was like a character.
01:03:48 It was like she calls all her reply guys big brother.
01:03:53 Like she does, like she pretends to be like a baby.
01:03:55 She's pretends to be like your little baby sister.
01:03:57 And like all her reply guys, no big brother, some, some idiot.
01:04:01 Some freak in the, in the replies is like, oh, I can't believe this guy was rude to you.
01:04:06 Should I go, should I go do a mass harassment campaign?
01:04:09 Should I go and get all my friends to down, to downvote his video, his shitty video game
01:04:13 that looks like shit on itch.io.
01:04:15 Should I go to his website and fucking, should I have his YouTube channel, uh, uh,
01:04:20 the reported for harassment?
01:04:21 And she's like, no, no big brother.
01:04:23 No, we can't, we can't seek to his level.
01:04:27 We can't be like him.
01:04:28 I'll be okay.
01:04:29 I promise, I promise big brother, I'll survive.
01:04:35 I have nothing but disdain for all these people.
01:04:39 But so that, that's what she did.
01:04:41 And so then I was like, well, OK, she made it public.
01:04:43 So I made a little post that was like, I just called it gross.
01:04:46 By the way, I haven't even said what the post was.
01:04:49 I haven't even explained what the post was for the audience.
01:04:52 The post in question, it was a meme.
01:04:55 And it said that it was just a picture of her character.
01:04:57 And it said, um, normalize having a comfort VTuber instead of a comfort person.
01:05:05 And I thought, what is a comfort person?
01:05:08 Anyway, well, that's the thing.
01:05:11 I turned out to be a little bit wrong, because what I thought that a comfort
01:05:15 person is like someone that you like take comfort in, like, like, like a friend.
01:05:21 Right.
01:05:23 So I was like, so I was like relationships with VTubers over having friends.
01:05:26 That's what you thought they were saying.
01:05:28 Something like that.
01:05:29 And I was like, that's like, fuck, like, fuck this.
01:05:32 This is weird.
01:05:33 Like, shut up.
01:05:34 Uh, yeah.
01:05:36 It's like, it's like, oh, put your, put your emotional, put your emotional
01:05:40 burdens on VTubers, rely on, on VTubers.
01:05:43 OK, there's actually a lot.
01:05:44 There's a lot here to talk about.
01:05:46 Because, yes, if, if that is what it was saying, it would be an
01:05:50 unacceptably, like, cloying, like, call to parasociality, like, and that would
01:05:57 be disgusting, and I would hate it.
01:05:59 So that's what I was initially responding to.
01:06:01 It turns out it's a little bit different, because I guess what a comfort
01:06:05 person is, is not like a friend.
01:06:08 It's like a, like a celebrity or someone that you, like, see and feel good.
01:06:14 A non-VTuber, parasocial relationship.
01:06:16 It's like, it's like a comfort character, but it's a, yes.
01:06:19 Yes, it's a not yes.
01:06:21 So it's, so it's a little different.
01:06:23 It's not saying replace your real life attachments with VTuber attached.
01:06:27 It's not quite that bad.
01:06:30 But still, but still, it's a post celebrating, you know, I feel like I
01:06:35 was misunderstood a little bit, because my problem, like, yes, it is parasocial
01:06:40 and that's, and that's lame and whatever, but that's not really why I
01:06:44 didn't like it, because it, because lots of things are parasocial.
01:06:47 And I don't think, I don't think that a parasocial relationship is in
01:06:51 and of itself bad or harmful.
01:06:53 Like it's okay to like a YouTuber.
01:06:56 It's okay to like a VTuber or to watch them and have an opinion about them.
01:07:01 And that's a parasocial relationship.
01:07:03 And that's not wrong or bad in and of itself.
01:07:07 So it's not, it's not just, a lot of people seem to think that I was just
01:07:10 saying, oh, this is encouraging parasocial relationships and that's bad.
01:07:14 And it's more than that.
01:07:16 What, what bugs me about it, because I see VTuber posts on the Endless War
01:07:21 RFCK account on Twitter, I followed a couple of slime themed VTubers just
01:07:27 because I thought it was funny.
01:07:28 And now all I see when I log into that account is recommended tweets from
01:07:32 VTubers and they're all, not all, but lots and lots of them have this attitude.
01:07:38 It reminds me a lot of the attitude of, it's like the attitude of the
01:07:45 Baroni analysis community that was all like really into the specific thing
01:07:50 they were doing and they were all just really like focused on this.
01:07:54 Isn't it cool that we all review my little pony?
01:07:59 Isn't it cool that we like, look at this, this community that we've built.
01:08:02 Oh, we all support each other.
01:08:03 We're all going to upvote each other's videos.
01:08:05 We're all going to like each other's videos.
01:08:07 We're all going to make it.
01:08:08 We're all going to make it guys.
01:08:10 It really reminds me in a lot, in a lot of ways of like the NFT space where
01:08:15 everybody's got a fucking ape, everyone's talking about how great their
01:08:18 apes are, everyone's hyping up their apes because they've, because they've
01:08:22 invested, you know, financially or emotionally into this thing.
01:08:27 And they're all there to hype each other up and get engagement from one another
01:08:31 because they all, they need to feel like this thing they're doing is important.
01:08:37 And they're all there to hype it to themselves and to one another.
01:08:40 And they're all there just like, whew, whipping themselves into like a VTubing
01:08:44 is the wave of the future.
01:08:46 V, it's VTubing is the fucking, this is the most important thing in the fucking
01:08:49 world.
01:08:50 I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's the attitude that I, that I see a lot.
01:08:54 And it really annoys me.
01:08:56 Isn't that like content creators largely?
01:09:00 Yeah.
01:09:01 And whatever like theme or like genre they're in.
01:09:04 Yeah.
01:09:05 I'm not saying it's exclusive to the, it's, it's a thing.
01:09:09 It's a thing, comics too.
01:09:12 Like when I would go on like the Topastic forums and see like, you know,
01:09:17 these small comic creators with no, no audience at all, just like all posting to
01:09:21 each other about their, their stuff, asking each other questions about like,
01:09:27 how do you like to write, you know, your protagonist?
01:09:30 Like, what's your favorite ship dynamic or whatever?
01:09:32 They're all talking about, it's fine.
01:09:35 Like it's fine, I guess.
01:09:37 This, the, I don't know, this, the attitude of like this, like, they're all being, you
01:09:43 got to be really positive.
01:09:44 We're all, we're all posting about whatever, whatever the interest is, whatever
01:09:48 the field is, like we're all here, we're all posting about it.
01:09:50 We're all being really positive about it.
01:09:52 Because we all, we're all hyping each other up.
01:09:53 Like we're all, none of us are getting anything out of it, right?
01:09:56 Like the people that do these kinds of posts, they're not successful.
01:10:00 They're, they're, they're, they're low on the totem pole.
01:10:04 And they're there because they, they need to convince themselves.
01:10:08 They need to have the sense of community that, oh, sure, I'm not getting anything
01:10:13 out of this, even though it's an interest of mine.
01:10:15 But, you know, everybody else is also not getting anything, we're all kind of here.
01:10:22 It's a community, we're doing, it's for the community.
01:10:24 Uh, I'm not successful as a VTuber.
01:10:26 I'm not, like, I don't have a big audience.
01:10:29 I'm not making any money at it.
01:10:31 It is just like a big sink for me, but we have a community and all
01:10:36 my other VTuber friends are the same.
01:10:38 We're all just fucking, fucking around and floundering and not getting anything out of it.
01:10:43 But we're having fun in its community.
01:10:45 You're saying that they're coping?
01:10:47 I'm saying it's, it's coping.
01:10:48 And it, and it's like, that's, that's what's unappealing to you is that they're,
01:10:53 they're not actually successful, but they're positive about what's going on.
01:10:57 It's part of it.
01:10:58 That's part of it.
01:10:59 But it, it, I feel like it exists.
01:11:01 I feel like the attitude, the attitude, I feel like it's an attitude that
01:11:05 benefits those at the top.
01:11:07 It's an attitude that is like this thing we're doing, this, this field that we're
01:11:13 all engaged in is important and let's, let's hype it up.
01:11:18 But the, but like, but they don't benefit from that hype.
01:11:22 They, they keep themselves engaged in it, but like the, the, only the people that
01:11:27 are already, the people that are already popular are going to stay popular.
01:11:30 Everybody's, all right.
01:11:31 VTubers want to be popular.
01:11:33 They want to have an audience.
01:11:34 That's what they want.
01:11:34 That's why they're doing it.
01:11:36 It's, it's, there'd be no reason to do it unless they wanted attention.
01:11:40 They want engagement.
01:11:41 They want an audience and, and they're all, but they're, they're, I feel like
01:11:45 they're, when they post like this, their audience is each other.
01:11:48 They're, they're appealing to each other and convincing one another about like,
01:11:53 yes, our feelings are valid.
01:11:56 We are all going to make it in this VTuber space and we're going to do that.
01:12:00 And we're going to do that.
01:12:01 It's like shout out, like, where are all my fellow, like male VTubers, all my
01:12:05 fellow male VTubers, we're all going to follow each other.
01:12:07 Everybody, like, like post below so I can find you and I can follow you.
01:12:12 That's what you do.
01:12:13 When you're a VTuber, you post a thing that's like, Hey, where are all my X
01:12:18 adjective VTubers, uh, uh, post below so I can follow you.
01:12:23 And the, and I think the unspoken implication there is that you hope
01:12:27 that they will also follow you back.
01:12:29 And it's, it's just this big incestuous slurry to take a phrase from Homestuck.
01:12:34 They're all just, they're all just people with no audience, just watching
01:12:38 each other, trying to get each other to watch each other.
01:12:42 I don't know, man.
01:12:43 That this is, this is, I, I, I can understand that that is a thing.
01:12:49 Yeah.
01:12:49 I could, I could see, I can, I can see that.
01:12:52 I don't know why it makes you so mad though.
01:12:55 I just would be like, eh, they're not going anywhere like that.
01:12:59 They got to like think differently.
01:13:01 And then I just move on.
01:13:03 I don't really think about them.
01:13:06 Yeah, like, you see, it benefits those at the top.
01:13:08 I don't really get how exactly if they're all just incestuous in their little group.
01:13:14 Are they, are they building like a bedrock of like, of VTuber in the public
01:13:21 consciousness that is benefiting the VTubers that already, already exist?
01:13:25 Or are they having no effect at all?
01:13:30 Cause I feel like it's, it's the, it may be the other way around that the big VTubers
01:13:34 are, are giving them hope that they can do something.
01:13:38 It just isn't doing anything for them.
01:13:43 I don't know.
01:13:44 Maybe it's both.
01:13:46 Maybe it's neither.
01:13:48 I mean, it's just, maybe it's just a feeling I have.
01:13:51 Maybe it's not even real.
01:13:53 Maybe it's just a phantasm.
01:13:55 Maybe you want to be a VTuber.
01:13:56 Maybe that's what this is all about.
01:13:58 I don't know.
01:14:00 Okay.
01:14:00 Ever since you saw the red man VTubing model, you were like, damn, I want that.
01:14:06 I want that for me.
01:14:08 Okay.
01:14:08 Well, even, even if they're a little bit incoherent, I've explained how I feel about
01:14:13 posts of this kind.
01:14:15 That's, that's why they annoyed me for all those reasons.
01:14:18 Parasocials thing.
01:14:20 It's, it's cloying.
01:14:21 It's like, it's sort of, I don't know.
01:14:24 It's sort of something about it to put one final, it's like, it's like, it's a little dishonest.
01:14:30 It feels, it, these posts feel to me like they're presented
01:14:34 neutrally.
01:14:36 But when you make them, when you post about something like that, like, replace, replace
01:14:40 replace, replace something else in your life with VTubers.
01:14:44 It's like, you're, you're, you're asking me for something.
01:14:47 You're posting this as though it's about VTubers in general, as though it's about some
01:14:51 general thing, but it's about you.
01:14:53 What you actually want is for me to do it with you, but you won't say that.
01:14:59 I don't know.
01:15:01 So I don't like it.
01:15:02 I didn't like it.
01:15:03 I called it bad, whatever.
01:15:04 Her fans went in apeshit in my comments, sent me gore, whatever.
01:15:10 A couple of people that followed me said that I was being a big meanie.
01:15:14 Ben, you're being too mean.
01:15:15 Ben, you've crossed the line.
01:15:16 Ben, you're a big jerk.
01:15:17 And I think those people are confused because I've been way meaner
01:15:24 and I've been way more problematic and said more offensive things on Twitter.
01:15:28 To Trixie and, and like, to trick, if you're just worried about the meanest,
01:15:33 then, yeah, I've been way meaner to Trixie.
01:15:35 If you're worried about me being like, you know, unfair or or cruel or whatever,
01:15:40 there was that time that I got mad at that black person for saying not to
01:15:43 draw us off a certain way.
01:15:45 I think I was a little unreasonable in that situation.
01:15:49 So so I've so I don't know why this would be this particular one.
01:15:53 It's just sort of baffling.
01:15:54 It's not exactly a bad thing.
01:15:56 It's just sort of like, man, you're you really hate VTubers, Ben.
01:15:59 I don't. I don't hate VTubers.
01:16:01 I truly swear to God, I don't hate what you hate that thing that you saw.
01:16:05 I swear to God, it's not it's not that I have a problem with VTubers
01:16:08 in specific for any reason.
01:16:10 It's just this is the thing that some of them do and it's an attitude that I hate.
01:16:16 And they're not the only ones to do it.
01:16:18 But the was it going to say, yeah, I genuinely think that some of the
01:16:24 reaction that some people had that were not even fans of this person,
01:16:27 they just saw this reaction and were like, Ben,
01:16:30 this is not OK.
01:16:32 I genuinely think some of them, their lizard brain neurons were activated
01:16:36 by the fact that this person posts in character like roleplays as a baby.
01:16:41 Like they reacted as though they thought I was like attacking an actual baby.
01:16:45 Like maybe intellectually, they know that this is not a baby,
01:16:49 but they sort of treated it as though I was like beating up
01:16:52 like an actual like small girl child instead of like an adult
01:16:57 who's like roleplaying this, this, this creepy like I'm being bullied,
01:17:02 big help me.
01:17:06 So, yeah, as always, I have no respect for those that disagree with me.
01:17:11 My enemies are all ontologically evil.
01:17:16 Sounds reasonable.
01:17:18 But the odd thing is, right?
01:17:20 So this was this was a bit of a Twitter kerfuffle.
01:17:23 There was a bit of an argument about it, a bit of a debate happened.
01:17:26 Whatever, who cares?
01:17:28 But then, and I don't want to dwell on this too much,
01:17:31 but a couple of people who I would have considered to be my actual friends
01:17:36 in real life, a couple of them decided that they hate me now
01:17:40 and they're not my friends anymore and they like and they've disowned me over it.
01:17:45 If you can if you can believe that.
01:17:48 So, yeah, these these people who had been my my friends for years
01:17:53 suddenly decided that I'm bad and they hate me
01:17:57 and they and they they joined they joined like a new server
01:18:02 devoted deliberately specifically to to attack me.
01:18:08 And they started spreading
01:18:10 they started spreading completely spurious
01:18:14 lies and accusations and just totally fabricated
01:18:18 criminally pseudo criminal allegations
01:18:21 against myself and other friends of mine, based in no facts whatsoever.
01:18:28 So this is just what so I so I found this.
01:18:32 So I found this to be a very surprising reaction
01:18:35 to me being sort of rude to a stranger on Twitter, like somewhat rude,
01:18:41 maybe a bit uncalled for idly mean.
01:18:44 Yeah, I feel like it must have been like that.
01:18:46 There was something brewing.
01:18:48 I agree. That's what I was going to say.
01:18:49 I think this this is this must have been some some
01:18:53 something was percolating under the surface for a while there.
01:18:56 And this is just the the the moment that that brought it out.
01:19:01 I don't think I would.
01:19:02 I don't think I would actually lose a friendship over something so stupid.
01:19:07 But so that was like a big thing for me this week is like a lot.
01:19:11 Actually, it really bugged me because for a couple of days there
01:19:14 in the wake of this stupid in the stupid VTuber Twitter drama
01:19:20 and this weird fallout with these people, I was like kind of
01:19:24 sort of fixated on this drama and on like these like, you know,
01:19:30 these lies that were being told about me and people around me.
01:19:33 And I was kind of had to like think about that.
01:19:35 And it almost made me late for my stupid.
01:19:38 Tales gets trolled, a guest page, but it worked.
01:19:43 It worked out OK.
01:19:46 Phew. Yeah, kind of my fault,
01:19:48 because I didn't start working on it early enough.
01:19:51 But yeah, I don't know.
01:19:54 It's a bunch of bullshit, a bunch of that bullshit happened to me this week.
01:20:00 It was a bit of a bummer.
01:20:01 But, you know what, these people will get through it.
01:20:07 I mean, the PCP has survived.
01:20:09 PCP more dangerous bombardments than such such as that.
01:20:14 Oh, speaking of speaking of.
01:20:19 Do you see what released on the PCP channel yesterday?
01:20:23 Oh, yeah, we should definitely talk about this.
01:20:26 Yeah, although I did not watch it because I'm I'm scared of cringing too hard.
01:20:31 I also had to kind of I didn't want I didn't watch.
01:20:35 I saw it. I skipped through parts of it.
01:20:37 I didn't want to watch my own part.
01:20:39 I don't want to see it.
01:20:41 So embarrassing.
01:20:43 I feel very validated that some people said my and Munchie's verse was like the best.
01:20:49 I remember.
01:20:50 I worked hard making that sound pretty good or like like right rhythmically.
01:20:55 I was thinking rhythmically.
01:20:56 I remember liking I can't like like I can't actually rap.
01:21:00 But like, I think I think I wrote something pretty good.
01:21:04 I did not.
01:21:04 I think I wrote like the first line of mine.
01:21:07 And then and then I couldn't think of anything.
01:21:10 So Trixie wrote my verse and that's why it's bad.
01:21:13 My verse is bad, but it's because Trixie wrote it for me.
01:21:16 But I mean, the asterisk on that is like,
01:21:20 I'm sure it would have been even worse if I had written it.
01:21:22 So, yeah, I mean, I remember distinctly, we were like,
01:21:26 all right, we got to we got to do the we got to film the rap
01:21:29 because it's going to be good weather today.
01:21:30 And then we're going to have to do the OVA tomorrow.
01:21:32 And then the good weather is over.
01:21:34 Yeah. And we were all rushing.
01:21:35 And I think we were just sitting around waiting for you to write your verse.
01:21:39 Yeah, I had a pen and pencil and paper.
01:21:43 I was like, just sat around like all morning just staring at a blank page.
01:21:47 Just being like, I can't I can't think of anything.
01:21:53 And Trixie eventually was just like, OK, here, you want me to write it for you?
01:21:57 I was like, yeah, fine, just just write something.
01:21:59 And then it was kind of dumb.
01:22:01 But I was like, it's better than nothing.
01:22:03 It's better than what I was going to get.
01:22:04 So, OK, I'll do it.
01:22:09 Yeah.
01:22:11 Rack on four, baby.
01:22:13 The ride never ends.
01:22:15 It'll never end.
01:22:16 It'll never end. Two years.
01:22:18 There's still 2020 in March.
01:22:20 Still the 2020 will never go away.
01:22:22 The last.
01:22:23 Yeah. So this video was one of there's one more video that needs to come out
01:22:27 and it's the OVA, which we have.
01:22:32 So we put we spent real money.
01:22:35 We spent real money on like producing the OVA.
01:22:40 Yeah. So I'll be funny when it comes out.
01:22:45 At this point, it's just hilarious to me.
01:22:47 Like if these people still are actually coming out.
01:22:51 Yeah, I mean, it's better like at any point.
01:22:57 You know, better late than never.
01:22:59 I mean, I saw a comment on the thing saying, why now?
01:23:02 And I'm like, OK, yeah, why?
01:23:04 Why are you suggesting that we should simply never do it?
01:23:09 Yeah, we got to do it.
01:23:11 Yeah, we have to do it.
01:23:12 They have to be made if only so that we could say we could put the whole thing to rest.
01:23:18 You know what that is?
01:23:19 That's the kind of cowardly attitude.
01:23:22 That's a cowardly, trixy attitude.
01:23:23 That's a kind of like, yeah, I promised I'd do a thing.
01:23:27 Yeah, I took money for a thing, but it's been a while and I haven't done it.
01:23:30 So nobody cares and whatever.
01:23:34 I don't have to actually do it.
01:23:36 It's fine. I'll just pocket it.
01:23:37 Whatever. Fuck you. Fuck you, fan.
01:23:40 Die. You love it.
01:23:44 You love Radcon four.
01:23:45 Everybody loves Radcon four.
01:23:48 We're going to make it trend in twenty twenty three.
01:23:51 Yeah, absolutely.
01:23:54 When in twenty twenty three, when the OVA comes out.
01:23:57 I'm I'm hoping that it won't take too long.
01:24:00 Also, the dojin, I know.
01:24:04 I have not. I have still not heard any word from
01:24:09 Kaiju, Kaiju about him having a time available to do that.
01:24:14 So I don't know.
01:24:18 I'm still hopeful that that can happen.
01:24:19 I just I don't know.
01:24:23 Kaiju is a hard worker.
01:24:24 Kaiju is the problem is not and not a flake.
01:24:27 So it will eventually happen.
01:24:29 It just might not take a while, I think.
01:24:31 Kaiju is not flaked.
01:24:32 Kaiju told me I'd love to do it, but I am very busy.
01:24:36 I will do it if I can find the time.
01:24:38 And I said, OK, and, you know, he's he's got other things to do.
01:24:41 And he just has not been able to do it.
01:24:45 And I mean, that's what I said when I when I agreed to hit with that.
01:24:49 I made I agreed with that possibility.
01:24:53 I would I mean, I would be open.
01:24:54 He said, like, you know, it might be easier if you find someone else.
01:24:58 I would I would do that.
01:25:00 I would be OK with letting someone else do.
01:25:02 I would just need to see their style
01:25:04 and like know that they are going to do something good.
01:25:07 And I don't know anyone else who I who I don't know anyone else off the top
01:25:12 of my head or who has the right style and the right, you know.
01:25:20 If someone if I if someone were to, say,
01:25:23 at me on Twitter or DM me or something on Discord with an artist recommendation,
01:25:27 it's like maybe this guy kind of has the sort of, you know,
01:25:32 black and white kind of classic anime mango look that you're looking for.
01:25:36 I would be willing to consider alternatives.
01:25:38 In fact, I think Kaiju would would understand.
01:25:41 He's told me this, in fact,
01:25:44 if anyone knows anyone who they think would be a good fit for the.
01:25:47 I mean, please tell me, I just don't know anyone.
01:25:50 I've looked around on Twitter, but I didn't find anyone who exactly
01:25:54 matched what I was looking for.
01:25:56 I mean, there's so many artists.
01:25:59 I'm sure there's somebody out there.
01:26:01 I just I just don't know him.
01:26:03 Help me. OK. Help, help, help.
01:26:08 I actually kind of think somebody needs to help me.
01:26:13 Because I have money.
01:26:14 I have money to pay the artist who eventually does that.
01:26:18 I just need to find someone who will do it.
01:26:23 I'm I'm I'm mad.
01:26:25 I'm still mad about that other guy, that other guy, that other guy
01:26:29 just disappeared and he is still not he is still not returned.
01:26:32 He is still not posted anything anywhere, except on
01:26:37 not my anime list, but that but that anime website.
01:26:44 What are you saying?
01:26:46 I was thinking, have you maybe asked
01:26:49 Maryweather if they know anyone?
01:26:53 Oh, my God.
01:26:56 You know, Maryweather does, you know, lots of anime style people, you know.
01:27:04 You know, it didn't it didn't even occur to me.
01:27:08 It didn't even occur to me, but.
01:27:11 He might know, actually, he might know someone.
01:27:13 Yeah, although demo, I wonder how much.
01:27:18 I mean, his artists are some of his his artists are like big.
01:27:22 Some of his like 100 100 K follower artists on Twitter
01:27:26 that like draw his stuff sometimes.
01:27:28 So some of them might be expensive, but they might be.
01:27:32 I mean, they might be expensive.
01:27:33 They might know other people.
01:27:35 I think it's just sort of hmm.
01:27:38 It's it's a good avenue to look at.
01:27:39 It's actually a great idea.
01:27:41 You know, he he messaged me.
01:27:44 He messaged me just just like last week.
01:27:49 Just to see how I was doing, actually, like just to check in on me.
01:27:54 That's nice.
01:27:55 It is nice.
01:27:56 I it's it's it's funny, I don't know.
01:28:01 I it's it's it's it's nice.
01:28:02 It's nice because like I have like nothing.
01:28:05 I have like nothing to offer that guy.
01:28:06 There's no there's nothing he could possibly want from me.
01:28:10 I can't be suspicious of like any ulterior motive.
01:28:14 I guess he just I guess he's just.
01:28:17 Wants to be I guess he's just my friends, which is a nice thing.
01:28:23 But what what a guy.
01:28:26 Yeah, maybe you should ask him about that.
01:28:29 He would he would he would be a guy.
01:28:31 He would be a guy to know about that.
01:28:33 OK, yeah, there's an idea.
01:28:35 Still still if anyone has any recommendations,
01:28:39 I mean, feel feel free to message me about him because I would.
01:28:43 Like to see options.
01:28:47 I don't know.
01:28:49 OK, OK, OK, Nate is to do the OVA.
01:28:56 Yeah, and then that'll be the entire thing completely done
01:29:01 after the after the dojin, yeah, the OVA and the dojin.
01:29:05 And then we get our and then we get our radical money.
01:29:10 Truly the longest wait.
01:29:13 Yeah, it'll it'll partially make up for
01:29:17 for missing for missing out on that on that March Patreon money.
01:29:25 Yeah, Nate's I've been talking to him about it.
01:29:29 There's still Radcon for money just in a pile,
01:29:32 just waiting to be waiting for everything to be completed so we can all just get it.
01:29:38 I mean, you need to fund Radcon five.
01:29:41 If we were if we were Trixie, if Trixie had the money, Trixie would have just said,
01:29:45 it's been like it's been a while since the Radcon.
01:29:48 Never mind. We just won't do it.
01:29:51 I'll just take it. I'll just take it.
01:29:53 I'll just take the money and spend it.
01:29:54 And then I'll say and then when someone says, hey, Trixie,
01:29:56 what about all that content that was promised to be delivered over the money?
01:29:59 She'd say, oh, well, you know, I actually couldn't do that
01:30:02 because I just spend it on like my food and house.
01:30:05 I just spend it on my personal expenses, you know, sorry.
01:30:09 But, you know, that's that's just content creation.
01:30:11 You know, that's just what it's like.
01:30:12 That's what it's like to be popular on YouTube.
01:30:15 You just take money from people and just spend it on whatever.
01:30:17 And then you say, ah, well, I spent it all so I can't do it.
01:30:20 You see. Oh, I hate it.
01:30:23 And I hate you. I know all too well.
01:30:25 Not, not you, Gib.
01:30:27 I hate you, random commenter that implicitly agreed with that attitude.
01:30:32 Why? Why now? Why now?
01:30:35 Sh, shut the fuck up, you coward.
01:30:38 You're a fucking coward. You know that?
01:30:40 You're a, you're a quitter.
01:30:45 I'll never quit.
01:30:49 That's true.
01:30:51 OK, what do you think?
01:30:54 Um, yeah, I got nothing else to talk about.
01:30:57 Yeah, you want to go voicemails?
01:31:00 Yes, that's all right.
01:31:03 What's voicemail? Let's voicemail.
01:31:06 Yeah, we got. OK, it looks like the.
01:31:12 Oh, my God, it's a number of pages.
01:31:14 There's two and a half pages.
01:31:16 Looks like the first one here is this is this vocaru.
01:31:20 All right. All right.
01:31:22 Three, two, one, go.
01:31:24 Just like in Marvel Cinematic Universe, there exists a lot of parallel worlds
01:31:29 similar to ours in some ways, but radically different in others.
01:31:33 Today, we will look at one such world.
01:31:36 Welcome to the Twilight Zone.
01:31:38 I am supposed to be taking a break.
01:31:41 I am supposed to be taking a break.
01:31:43 Instead, I'm working.
01:31:45 I'm doing something.
01:31:47 I'm sending taxes.
01:31:49 Sending taxes.
01:31:51 I am a cool guy.
01:31:53 I am a godlike.
01:31:55 I've got a deadline already done it.
01:32:00 Hello, this is the workaholic podcast,
01:32:03 and I am your host, the most masculine and manly man of all men, Gorilla Gifts.
01:32:10 And today we are joined by the creator of the hit indie game of 2016.
01:32:16 Hyper Light Drifter, the most feminine woman of all women who never drinks
01:32:20 sparkling water, Jane Devil.
01:32:24 Unfortunately, Tommy Oliver, the healthiest person who has ever lived,
01:32:29 has died when selecting best voicemails, so he won't be joining us today.
01:32:36 I am kidding.
01:32:37 Tom will never die.
01:32:38 Not in this world, not in any of it.
01:32:40 I like that that's a universal constant.
01:32:41 Let's start as usual from crowning the voicemail that our commenters decided
01:32:45 was the best in the previous episode.
01:32:48 Welcome, the Twilight Sparkle.
01:32:53 Oh, thank you.
01:32:54 Thank you, Jane.
01:32:55 I must ask, did you receive my email?
01:32:59 Yes, we have reviewed your CV and we accept you.
01:33:03 Welcome to the workaholic podcast.
01:33:09 But this is only one of the possibilities.
01:33:11 I will see you next time in the Twilight Zone.
01:33:14 Wouldn't that be fun?
01:33:18 Twilight Sparkle joined the workaholics podcast.
01:33:22 That would that would ruin everything as far as I'm concerned.
01:33:25 I would quit watching.
01:33:28 I would cancel my subscription on Hulu.
01:33:33 OK, yeah.
01:33:36 I like how everything was the opposite, except Tom still never dies.
01:33:41 Oh, Oblivionfall is.
01:33:47 Hmm.
01:33:48 Oblivionfall is posting some posting some cringe.
01:33:55 This must be.
01:33:57 Oh, this was his.
01:33:59 Oh, I think it was his friend Twi-Pi from the stream said that they were drawing Virginia.
01:34:05 And I guess this must be those Virginia.
01:34:07 Oh, they're very.
01:34:09 Why does she have a cock?
01:34:11 Why does she have a glowing green cock?
01:34:13 Yeah.
01:34:14 I mean, why not?
01:34:15 You could.
01:34:17 Yeah, I mean, yeah.
01:34:18 You could reform it using slime.
01:34:21 Damn.
01:34:22 Sure.
01:34:23 Yeah.
01:34:24 Well.
01:34:26 No, Virginia, stop fucking that sexy lady.
01:34:28 I want to fuck that sexy.
01:34:30 Get off her.
01:34:31 Let me let me at it, please.
01:34:34 Oh, she's got the she's got the horrifying, the horrifying utter, utter boobs.
01:34:40 Crotch tits.
01:34:42 Yeah, the crotch tits that I just my favorite.
01:34:48 What reaction, Emote?
01:34:51 OK, here we go.
01:34:53 An exclamation point and a little phantom horn looking on in approval.
01:34:57 I think that's, I think that's what we're going to be, we're going to be dealing with.
01:35:02 Nice, nice glowing nipples, Virginia.
01:35:05 You, you nailed it.
01:35:08 You hit it out of the park.
01:35:10 All right, we can't show that.
01:35:12 No, we can't show that on the podcast, so we're not going to dwell on it anymore.
01:35:19 OK, here's a next voicemail is an image.
01:35:22 Oh, it's the workaholic podcast.
01:35:25 The workaholics podcast, Jane Devil and Gorilla Give.
01:35:32 These are cool.
01:35:34 Yeah.
01:35:35 Deep symbolism of the egg.
01:35:38 Yep.
01:35:40 What's that?
01:35:41 She says that.
01:35:42 Oh, deep.
01:35:43 Yeah, that's what.
01:35:44 Yeah.
01:35:45 Yeah.
01:35:46 All right.
01:35:47 Good, good thing.
01:35:49 All right.
01:35:50 Next.
01:35:51 Next voicemail is called.
01:35:53 Trixie admits she's stupid in recent stream.
01:35:56 Bird agrees.
01:35:57 Okay.
01:35:58 Three, two, one, go.
01:36:00 You were up to and saw you were streaming.
01:36:02 Didn't know you rebranded.
01:36:03 Welcome back.
01:36:04 And yeah, the rebranding effort.
01:36:06 It complicated matters.
01:36:08 Not a lot of people really understand what happened or.
01:36:13 So I made this mistake when I rebranded of taking down all of my older videos and then telling people to re upload them and make archives.
01:36:23 Yeah, that was a bad idea.
01:36:24 Yep.
01:36:25 It's almost it's almost like everything that I said that made her so mad that she rage quit the podcast and swore me off forever.
01:36:33 It's almost like everything that I said that made her do that was exactly right.
01:36:39 Almost.
01:36:40 Almost.
01:36:41 You might.
01:36:42 I mean, that's one way to interpret the situation.
01:36:46 Next.
01:36:47 Next voicemail is called.
01:36:49 Trixie still desperately tries to justify keeping a studio.
01:36:53 Three, two, one, go.
01:36:55 Are you going to stick to your studio brand?
01:36:58 IMO as a current fan.
01:36:59 I consider it to not be a very memorable, identifiable moniker for your work, both individually and as a collective.
01:37:03 I feel like a specific name is a lot better than blank studio, which feels more general, but it's supposed to feel general.
01:37:07 It's supposed to feel like a studio name.
01:37:09 I'm not supposed to feel like the name from my content.
01:37:11 I'm Trixie the Golden Witch.
01:37:12 The ex-studio is the ex-studio.
01:37:14 You know, I understand where you're coming from.
01:37:18 I don't think YouTube names matter very much at all.
01:37:21 If you look at popular YouTube channels, a lot of them have nonsense names, stuff that just doesn't mean anything.
01:37:25 Like people aren't looking at the name of the channel except to figure out what it like.
01:37:28 The only reason my name is confusing specifically is that I had a different name, you know.
01:37:31 And so it's like, what the hell is this?
01:37:32 People show up like literally what the fuck is the ex-studio?
01:37:33 I don't know who this is or what this is.
01:37:35 But like, you know, if the channel had always been called ex-studio, nobody would be questioning it.
01:37:40 I don't think it would have had a harder time getting popular.
01:37:42 Yeah, that's their point.
01:37:43 You changed the name.
01:37:45 It does hurt my YouTube SEO for me to have changed the channel name, but that would have happened no matter what I changed it to.
01:37:50 I think that in terms of, it's not really meant to be as memorable as it is meant to be timeless.
01:37:57 Like I said, I wanted a symbol that will always make sense and that will always be like applicable, you know.
01:38:03 So it's just, it's meant to be very broad so it can last forever.
01:38:07 It's meant to be something that you can just always recognize and everything can be tied to it.
01:38:10 And it doesn't have to be, you know, changed to fit a different project or whatever.
01:38:13 Like, everything that's released under the umbrella of the ex-studio is a ex-studio work, you know.
01:38:18 But that can encompass whatever the people who happen to be involved happen to do.
01:38:21 Who's involved?
01:38:22 Most people pronounce it like what does that mean?
01:38:24 What does that mean?
01:38:25 Okay, well yeah, yig is not, yig is not just for me.
01:38:29 Yig is for everyone who's releasing under the yig name, is yig.
01:38:34 I mean, you tried that.
01:38:37 You had a bunch of like, stoner idiots making shitty raps.
01:38:42 You turned it into a rap channel for a while.
01:38:45 It was a complete failure.
01:38:47 You shunted all those projects off to new channels and then didn't advertise them and just left them there to die because nobody watched them.
01:38:57 And now, it's like, it's like, it's like, I, okay, I'm gonna radically rebrand, right?
01:39:05 I'm no longer, like, Digibro is dead.
01:39:07 I am no longer just an anime analysis channel.
01:39:11 I'm more than that now.
01:39:12 I do, now I do raps.
01:39:14 Now I do shitty vlogs with my friends where I harass strangers at stores.
01:39:20 Now, now, this is the channel and everyone that doesn't like it was never a fan in the first place.
01:39:26 And you're never, and you're not even allowed to talk about my old persona.
01:39:32 You're a fake fan if you do.
01:39:34 And then a year later, like, oops, everything about that was a failure.
01:39:38 Okay, well, I'm gonna, okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
01:39:42 I'm gonna go back to doing the exact style of content I did before.
01:39:45 I'm gonna do the exact stuff I did before I rebranded that people used to like.
01:39:52 Because you're gonna try and do that again.
01:39:54 But I'm still Yig Studio.
01:39:56 I'm still not that old channel.
01:39:58 You're still not allowed, Digibro was still just a character I was playing.
01:40:02 Not even a real person.
01:40:04 It was all just an act and you fell for it.
01:40:08 I am going to continue to do exactly what they did.
01:40:12 But it was still just an act.
01:40:15 I don't know, whatever, it's dumb.
01:40:18 There's no, there's no studio.
01:40:21 It's just me posting anime reviews again, but I swear, guys,
01:40:25 Yig Studio is still a thing.
01:40:29 One day we'll make low rent, which one day we'll make that original anime drawn by Mint Salad, LeMau.
01:40:37 Okay, whatever.
01:40:41 Next voicemail, I guess.
01:40:43 It's called B321GO.
01:40:47 Okay.
01:40:50 Next one is a YouTube video.
01:40:53 Bitcoin $100.
01:40:56 Experts are now saying Bitcoin be worth $100.
01:40:58 Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.
01:41:00 Experts are now saying Bitcoin could be worth $100.
01:41:04 And what this means is basically that if you have $100, you could purchase one Bitcoin.
01:41:12 Or if you had $1.
01:41:16 That would be the equivalent of something that you would need $100 of to purchase one Bitcoin.
01:41:24 He's trying so hard.
01:41:26 If a Bitcoin is worth $100, that means it's worth $100 more than $1.
01:41:31 And if you have $100 Bitcoin, then you have that's worth...
01:41:40 Got it.
01:41:41 The most brain-working crypto bro.
01:41:44 Damn, imagine Bitcoin $100.
01:41:47 Okay, the space between the bit and the coin.
01:41:50 Okay, I get it.
01:41:51 Very funny, very droll.
01:41:54 Imagine if Bitcoin $100.
01:41:57 I for one can't even.
01:42:00 Alright, next one is called Soul Link Nuzlocs.
01:42:03 3, 2, 1, go.
01:42:15 That sounds cringe.
01:42:16 That's why you don't fucking play it that way.
01:42:18 The point is to play it with a jolly good friend at the same time.
01:42:21 So you can turn the single player game with Pokemon into a cooperative experience.
01:42:25 So that you care about what happens in each other's runs.
01:42:28 And you can go further than just having that one fainting rule.
01:42:31 You can require both players to have each Soul Link Pokemon in both of their parties at the same time.
01:42:36 Which creates a unique team building experience for gems, dungeons, and especially the Elite Four.
01:42:42 Okay, okay, yeah.
01:42:44 If you were playing it, if you were sitting in the same room and playing the same battles as someone,
01:42:50 then yeah, I guess I can see how that would...
01:42:54 It seems really inconvenient, but I can see how it would be fun.
01:42:58 And I can see how it would be a more unique experience than a regular Nuzloc.
01:43:04 I guess I would get it, if that's how you did it.
01:43:08 Okay, next one is called...
01:43:12 It's a YouTube link.
01:43:14 It's 11 minutes.
01:43:16 Oh, it's a Yeeg Studio video.
01:43:18 Who cares?
01:43:20 We're not watching an 11 minute video as a voicemail.
01:43:23 What's...
01:43:26 Am I supposed to have an opinion about...
01:43:30 Spy X Family is for everyone.
01:43:33 Maybe it is.
01:43:36 I don't fucking care.
01:43:37 Why would you send this?
01:43:38 Okay, whatever.
01:43:39 At least it wasn't long.
01:43:40 Next one is called Casual Gamer.
01:43:42 Three, two, one, go.
01:43:44 Hey Ben, I don't know.
01:43:46 I started your game and I couldn't make it through the first hallway.
01:43:52 I don't know.
01:43:53 I guess I'm pretty casual gamer, but it just made me feel like I didn't want to play anymore.
01:43:59 And that's it. Bye.
01:44:01 What do you mean you couldn't make it through the first hallway?
01:44:05 The game is all one hallway.
01:44:10 Maybe I assumed it was bigger than that.
01:44:12 You're gonna have to be more specific.
01:44:15 Just use all of the buttons until you win.
01:44:18 Yeah, if you're losing, try shit in the menu.
01:44:23 Explore the options in the menu until you find some stuff.
01:44:28 And then just see what it does.
01:44:32 You gotta just trial and error, fuck around, and find out what stuff does,
01:44:36 and then you can figure out how to win.
01:44:38 That's how you do it.
01:44:39 I don't know.
01:44:40 I don't want to get more specific than that.
01:44:42 An idiot like Oblivionfall figured it out.
01:44:45 Even someone as lowly as Give and Take figured it out.
01:44:48 Surely you.
01:44:50 I consider myself a casual gamer.
01:44:53 Right, so there you go.
01:44:54 Oblivion said he doesn't even play video games, or not much.
01:44:58 So he said on the stream.
01:45:01 So even my mom was kind of figuring it out on the second try.
01:45:07 She just was bad at selecting the Sonichu.
01:45:11 And you know, I gave the game to my dog, and my dog won.
01:45:15 Right.
01:45:16 Even quicker than I did.
01:45:17 He just rolled around on the keyboard, and he won.
01:45:19 So you gotta have better excuses than that.
01:45:26 I gave it to a zygote, and the zygote completed it.
01:45:29 Like a fucking speedrun time.
01:45:32 I sacrificed the game on an altar to God, and God sent it back, and he had won.
01:45:39 He had beat it quite easily.
01:45:41 It only took him like two hours, so he was actually pretty good at it.
01:45:45 He understood the mechanics intuitively.
01:45:49 Next one is called, At It's All So Ugly.
01:45:52 Hey, that's my Twitter handle.
01:45:53 Three, two, one, go.
01:45:55 Ben Saint, after relentlessly abusing a drug-addled neurodivergent trans woman,
01:46:00 and now setting your sights on a small, seven-year-old Japanese girl,
01:46:04 is there anyone you want to rest?
01:46:08 Well, Ben.
01:46:09 I swear to God, people were acting as though she was actually like a little baby.
01:46:14 Even though, guys, she was like posting about the thing.
01:46:19 She was posting about my bowying, ooh-ooh.
01:46:22 She was doing it in character.
01:46:24 She was staying in character, and she was posting about it.
01:46:28 She doesn't give a fuck.
01:46:29 It was fine.
01:46:30 Nobody cares.
01:46:31 If you care, you're fucking stupid, okay?
01:46:34 You're fucking stupid if you think this was a big deal at all.
01:46:38 You know, Econ.
01:46:40 Econ wrote pages and pages.
01:46:42 He wrote like 30 fucking replies to me about it.
01:46:45 He was like, he would not shut the fuck up about this dumb nonsense.
01:46:50 That guy's fucking stupid.
01:46:52 That guy fucking sucks.
01:46:53 I don't know what the fuck is wrong with him.
01:46:55 This was intolerable to him.
01:46:58 That guy's full of fucking nonsense, and I can't fucking stand it.
01:47:01 That guy did me a solid.
01:47:03 That guy did me a solid when I had that breakup,
01:47:06 and he let me crash on his couch for a few weeks,
01:47:09 and I appreciate that so much that I've put up with him on Twitter for this long,
01:47:13 but I can't fucking stand it anymore.
01:47:15 He's too fucking much.
01:47:16 I can't deal with it.
01:47:17 How long do I have to abide by someone's nonsense?
01:47:22 Just because the game did me a solid.
01:47:24 Alright, how much?
01:47:26 How much is too much?
01:47:27 70 times 7.
01:47:29 Turn the other cheek.
01:47:32 Not anymore.
01:47:33 You should do him a liquid.
01:47:35 Okay.
01:47:36 Next one is called Lord of Ghosts vs. King Herod.
01:47:41 Oh, it's a vocaru.
01:47:43 It's a vocaru.
01:47:44 Okay, here it is.
01:47:45 Three.
01:47:46 You got it?
01:47:47 Yeah.
01:47:48 Alright, three, two, one, go.
01:47:50 God, it's three fucking minutes long.
01:47:52 I'm gonna kill myself.
01:47:53 Lord of Ghosts, I am overjoyed to meet you face to face.
01:48:02 You've been making quite a name all around the place.
01:48:11 You've been spooky, not raising from the dead.
01:48:18 What?
01:48:19 That's stupid.
01:48:20 Now I understand your mayor.
01:48:25 Taste.
01:48:26 At least that's what they say.
01:48:36 So if your mayor ghost, yes, the sweet lord of ghosts,
01:48:42 Prove to me that you love slime, let's go do some crime.
01:48:46 That's all you need to, and I won't kill you.
01:48:51 Come on, lord of the ghosts.
01:48:55 I only ask what I'd ask any slimy bro.
01:48:59 Look, there's a juvie.
01:49:01 Let's hit the death blow.
01:49:03 Oh, I love killing, as I'm quite a fan.
01:49:08 If you're gonna be mayor, well, you gotta lead by example, man.
01:49:13 So if your mayor ghost, yes, the sweet lord of ghosts,
01:49:18 Let's go and gorge on slime.
01:49:21 It'll simply be divine.
01:49:22 If you do that for me, I will let you go free.
01:49:27 Come on, lord of the ghosts.
01:49:32 What's this?
01:49:33 You say you have a comic all about your life?
01:49:36 But will it make me a pog?
01:49:38 You're saying it will?
01:49:40 It will.
01:49:41 Well, I guess I gotta read it and support the artist on Patreon.com.
01:49:45 Slash give or take.
01:49:46 Yeah.
01:49:47 Yeah.
01:49:48 Enough haunting, it is time for you to kill.
01:49:53 Slice and maim him, and slurp his slime with skill.
01:49:57 Oh, I'm slime cooming.
01:49:59 Yes, I can't wait.
01:50:01 I'm dying to be shown that you can truly titillate.
01:50:06 So if your mayor ghost, yes, the sweet lord of ghosts,
01:50:11 Prove to me that there is no cracks.
01:50:14 Cleave this juvie's head with an axe.
01:50:16 Is something wrong?
01:50:17 Lord of ghosts, what do you take so long?
01:50:20 Come on, lord of the ghosts.
01:50:26 Hey, aren't you scared of me, dude?
01:50:31 Mr. Spooky Attitude.
01:50:36 You're a joke.
01:50:37 You're not my mayor.
01:50:39 You're nothing but a spooky surveyor.
01:50:41 I'll kill you for good.
01:50:42 I always knew that I should.
01:50:45 Goodbye, you lord of the.
01:50:48 Goodbye, lord of the.
01:50:50 Goodbye, lord of the ghosts.
01:50:56 What's that above us?
01:50:57 That's a mega slime?
01:50:58 I've never seen that before.
01:50:59 What's going on?
01:51:04 Wow.
01:51:05 That's exactly how it happened.
01:51:07 Huh?
01:51:08 Yeah, that was great.
01:51:11 That's my favorite song from Jesus Christ, Superstar.
01:51:18 I don't, I can't, I don't think I have anything to add.
01:51:21 No, it was wonderful.
01:51:22 Wonderful, wonderful.
01:51:24 Thank you, Dusty Dumps, for another masterpiece.
01:51:28 Yeah.
01:51:29 Next one is a YouTube, it's a YouTube link.
01:51:34 18 minutes long.
01:51:37 Pro-skated to award-winning actor, the Jason Lee story, looking back.
01:51:42 Who?
01:51:43 I don't know.
01:51:44 Oh, this is the guy.
01:51:46 He's a skateboarder.
01:51:48 I know this actor.
01:51:49 I know he's been in stuff.
01:51:50 Wait a minute.
01:51:52 There's other skaters than Tony Hawk?
01:51:55 It's true.
01:51:57 No more skating, Tony Hawk, because you're just skating by after all that high impact sport,
01:52:04 destroyed your tendons and ligaments.
01:52:06 Destroyed your taint.
01:52:08 Oh, here we go.
01:52:09 Here we go.
01:52:10 The next one is an Imgirlink, dudes be like.
01:52:13 Oh.
01:52:14 Don't reply to me weirdo.
01:52:16 My brother in Christ, you made the reply with a soul utility of provoking a response by being more incendiary than it,
01:52:23 by being more incendiary than it is anything else.
01:52:26 I don't know, fucking cry about it.
01:52:28 Fucking, fucking cry about it, that I was rude to someone.
01:52:32 Like, shut up and die.
01:52:33 Shut the fuck up and die.
01:52:35 Why are you so upset?
01:52:36 Why are you so upset that I was rude to someone?
01:52:38 Who fucking cares?
01:52:39 You're literally more upset than she was.
01:52:42 She didn't even break a character, you psycho.
01:52:45 You don't know how upset they were, they just made a meme.
01:52:48 She didn't break character.
01:52:50 Who didn't break character?
01:52:52 The VTuber.
01:52:55 Oh, yeah.
01:52:56 I'm talking about the person who made the meme.
01:52:58 Oh.
01:53:00 They seem upset.
01:53:02 They seem upset.
01:53:04 Well, I know this is a contemporary meme.
01:53:07 This seems like a genuinely meant criticism.
01:53:10 And anyone that genuinely gives me authentic criticism
01:53:14 is automatically mad and wrong.
01:53:18 Okay, whatever.
01:53:19 Okay, whatever.
01:53:20 Haha, very funny, very good meme.
01:53:22 Ah, yeah, love it.
01:53:26 Okay, next page of these fucking voicemails.
01:53:30 Oh, it's another YouTube.
01:53:33 Oh, it's from smiling friends.
01:53:35 It's from smiling friends?
01:53:38 It's a Gilbert Gottfried scene.
01:53:40 It's 30 seconds long.
01:53:42 Well, whatever.
01:53:43 I'm not going to watch it.
01:53:44 Yeah, smiling friends good.
01:53:45 Gilbert Gottfried's dead.
01:53:46 That's too bad.
01:53:47 What are you going to do?
01:53:48 Next one is called Blue Wave.
01:53:50 Am I right?
01:53:51 Three, two, one, go.
01:53:53 Hey guys, what do you think is going to happen
01:53:56 during the midterms?
01:53:57 I think they're about to get silly.
01:54:00 Silly?
01:54:01 Yeah.
01:54:04 I think they're going to be pretty mid.
01:54:08 I've been seeing a lot of speculation
01:54:10 that the midterms are not going to go well
01:54:12 for the Democrats, and that's a shame.
01:54:16 I mean, Biden only barely beat Trump,
01:54:20 which is embarrassing.
01:54:23 And I don't think people have improved
01:54:26 their opinion of him too much.
01:54:29 Yeah, I don't see it going too well,
01:54:33 which sucks, but that's what you get
01:54:35 with Biden, I guess.
01:54:37 They have not really done that much.
01:54:39 They have not really done a lot of the stuff
01:54:41 they said they were going to do,
01:54:42 like student loan forgiveness didn't happen.
01:54:46 So, yeah, I think it might not go so well.
01:54:51 Also, they're like, I don't know,
01:54:53 like all the stupid, like anti-CRT
01:54:57 and like don't say gay stuff seems like
01:55:00 weirdly popular with fucking
01:55:06 the brainwirmed American populace, I guess.
01:55:09 I don't know.
01:55:10 I don't know if that's true or not.
01:55:11 That's just my impression.
01:55:12 Yeah, it's my impression as well.
01:55:15 I hope it's not true, but maybe it is.
01:55:17 I think it's just that the Democrats
01:55:18 are not providing anything of interest
01:55:21 to anyone to oppose it.
01:55:24 The only thing we're hearing about is like,
01:55:27 look at how evil the Republicans are being
01:55:29 and the Democrats say nothing.
01:55:31 It's like, okay.
01:55:32 Well, I guess that's the only political information
01:55:35 going on right now is the bad stuff.
01:55:38 I mean, that's my impression.
01:55:42 Oh, well.
01:55:44 Next voicemail is this YouTube link to,
01:55:47 this is, I've seen, I haven't watched these.
01:55:53 This guy, the gamer from Mars,
01:55:55 decided in the year 2022 to make a whole
01:55:58 like the story of Chris Chan series.
01:56:02 Boogie was in it and I fucking hate Boogie.
01:56:04 I know that this, I know that this,
01:56:07 this series does not respect Chris's agenda.
01:56:11 So it's bad.
01:56:16 How many times can one person be documented
01:56:19 by so many different people?
01:56:21 I mean, that's true, but that's been true.
01:56:24 People have been calling Chris like the most
01:56:26 documented person in the history,
01:56:28 like for a while.
01:56:30 I don't know why this guy decided
01:56:32 that now was the time for another one,
01:56:34 but I saw it going around.
01:56:36 I guess it got a lot of views.
01:56:37 So I guess he was right.
01:56:38 I don't know, whatever.
01:56:40 Fuck this guy and fuck Boogie.
01:56:43 True.
01:56:44 I don't know, man.
01:56:45 It's just, it's really easy.
01:56:47 It's really easy to just not misgender,
01:56:50 but you chose to do it.
01:56:53 So, I mean, that's on you forever, I guess.
01:56:57 Next one is called A321GO.
01:57:02 It is finally time to review another Paper Mario game.
01:57:08 I reviewed Color Splash when it came out
01:57:10 and that was pretty early in my channel's life.
01:57:12 Covering the game was what really launched my career.
01:57:15 So it's kind of surreal to be here again.
01:57:18 Enough time has passed that Nintendo has made
01:57:20 another Paper Mario game and here I am reviewing it.
01:57:24 I barely hear that, but what was that?
01:57:27 It was Arlo reviewing a new Paper Mario game
01:57:35 and saying that, wow, dunking on Color Splash
01:57:38 is what made me popular in the first place.
01:57:41 Can't believe they made a new Paper Mario
01:57:43 and I'm reviewing it.
01:57:45 So interesting.
01:57:47 Next one is called Slavoj Žižek on VTubers.
01:57:50 Three, two, one, go.
01:57:52 Ben Sheint is correct about VTubers.
01:57:58 Thanks, Slavoj.
01:58:00 Community is insular and cringe.
01:58:08 Thanks.
01:58:10 Good job.
01:58:12 Someone who was convinced that I am simply
01:58:17 a hater and an anti-VTuber bigot
01:58:23 and just had declared war on all VTubers.
01:58:26 Someone apparently sent Tom a question to do
01:58:30 on his Patreon podcast or whatever and asked him,
01:58:33 I don't know, I didn't hear the response
01:58:35 and I didn't hear the question.
01:58:37 I only heard it secondhand, but my impression is
01:58:39 that they asked him, like, Tom,
01:58:42 what do you think about Ben,
01:58:44 like cruelly harassing VTubers for no crime
01:58:47 other than being VTubers?
01:58:49 What do you think about Ben using his platform
01:58:51 to harass and destroy people who have done nothing
01:58:54 other than be VTubers publicly?
01:58:57 How do you feel about him going after them
01:58:59 for their identity like that?
01:59:01 And I assume Tom's response was like,
01:59:04 it's bad.
01:59:09 But apparently...
01:59:11 Anyway, the point is somewhere in that question
01:59:13 they said cringe and my problem with the post
01:59:17 was not that it was cringe.
01:59:19 I guess it sort of is, but that's not really...
01:59:22 It's not merely that like, oh, the post is cringe
01:59:25 and so I hate it.
01:59:27 It's not so banal as that.
01:59:31 It's mischaracterizing what I hate about it.
01:59:34 But whatever.
01:59:36 Okay, next one is a stupid YouTube link
01:59:38 that I'm sure I guarantee we won't watch.
01:59:41 It's Yig Studio again.
01:59:44 Why would you... Why?
01:59:46 Yeah, I get it. Yeah, she's putting out...
01:59:48 She's shot gunning out a bunch of stupid little videos.
01:59:51 Who cares?
01:59:53 I think the person putting all these YouTube links
01:59:55 might be the same person.
01:59:57 We don't watch them, so don't do that.
01:59:59 I would suspect probably so, but I would never...
02:00:03 I don't... I don't even...
02:00:05 I mean, obviously we're not going to watch it.
02:00:08 Maybe you think that this is like
02:00:10 suggesting something for us to talk about,
02:00:12 but no, of course not.
02:00:14 You should put that in a voicemail
02:00:16 if you want us to talk about something specific
02:00:18 and then have a YouTube link as like context
02:00:20 that we can watch later if you really want to,
02:00:22 but like just putting a link isn't going to do anything.
02:00:24 Okay, but even if the question is
02:00:26 what do you think about this video?
02:00:28 The answer is nothing.
02:00:30 Sure.
02:00:32 Next one is a very innocent question.
02:00:35 Three, two, one, go.
02:00:37 Ben Saint, I have a question.
02:00:40 Does your sister look more like you as a girl
02:00:44 or more like Nate as a girl?
02:00:47 I need to know for my masturbation fantasy,
02:00:50 kay, thanks, bye.
02:00:52 Oh, okay. Oh, that's why you...
02:00:55 I think my sister...
02:00:58 I think that my sister and Nate
02:01:00 look a little bit more like our mom
02:01:02 and I look a little bit more like our dad,
02:01:04 so I think Nate Grace looks more like Nate.
02:01:08 That's my opinion.
02:01:11 Like that one picture of Nate with the long hair.
02:01:14 Sorta, yeah.
02:01:17 Okay, next one is called What's in Your Fridge?
02:01:19 Three, two, one, go.
02:01:21 Hey guys and gal, what do you keep in the fridge?
02:01:24 Like all the time.
02:01:26 Me, broccoli, goes with everything.
02:01:28 Ben, you can't say seltzer.
02:01:30 I don't keep my seltzer in the fridge.
02:01:32 I keep it on a shelf because I don't really care
02:01:34 if it's cold and I don't have enough space
02:01:36 in my fridge to hold all the seltzer.
02:01:39 I have like 30 bottles of seltzer on my...
02:01:42 maybe not 30, maybe 20.
02:01:45 I put milk in the fridge
02:01:47 because I either have cereal with milk
02:01:50 or I put milk in my tea and I always need milk.
02:01:53 I keep low calorie ice cream in the freezer,
02:01:59 but that's not what you asked.
02:02:01 In the fridge I keep some vegetables,
02:02:04 some tomatoes and some greens,
02:02:07 like some spring mix greens.
02:02:10 I keep cold cuts, ham, turkey, eggs, cheese in the drawer.
02:02:17 And I keep low carb, bandurita tortillas.
02:02:23 I have several big stack of bags of bandurita tortillas.
02:02:29 And that's like it, that's like most of what I eat.
02:02:32 Oh, sauces, you know.
02:02:34 Caesar dressing, ranch dressing.
02:02:38 Butter, cheese.
02:02:40 I mean, stuff needs to be cold, I guess.
02:02:43 That is basically all I keep in my fridge
02:02:46 because that's pretty much most of what I eat,
02:02:49 what I just listed off there.
02:02:52 Make a lot of wraps, cook a lot of eggs,
02:02:56 make egg wraps sometimes if I'm feeling crazy.
02:03:00 We have eggs outside the fridge.
02:03:03 We have eggs on looker.
02:03:05 We have one of those weird egg spirals.
02:03:08 I guess you don't have to refrigerate eggs.
02:03:11 Yeah, I don't know what they're called.
02:03:15 Egg, we'll type in that egg spiral.
02:03:19 Egg holder spiral.
02:03:21 Oh, yeah.
02:03:22 Oh, yeah.
02:03:23 Huh.
02:03:24 You know, I guess, I think eggs do keep longer
02:03:27 if you keep them in the fridge,
02:03:28 but like I know you don't have to keep them in there.
02:03:31 I eat eggs basically every day, so.
02:03:34 I see.
02:03:35 You know, heck, maybe I should,
02:03:38 I do need to conserve fridge space.
02:03:40 Maybe I should just start keeping my eggs out
02:03:43 because I share my fridge with like four other guys,
02:03:46 so I'm always like,
02:03:48 you pushed my shit out of the way.
02:03:51 All right, next one is called
02:03:53 vinegar man, vinegar man, vinegar man
02:03:55 from the at rapist.com.
02:03:58 Next one, okay, three, two, one, go.
02:04:01 The Simpsons women stared in amazement
02:04:04 at the saint.
02:04:06 Send the end word three times
02:04:09 without flinching.
02:04:11 Holy shit.
02:04:13 I love Benzane.
02:04:19 Oh, they made you say it.
02:04:22 Vinegar.
02:04:24 Oh, God.
02:04:27 Dude, you're gonna get canceled.
02:04:30 That's good.
02:04:32 I feel, wow, this guy really got me.
02:04:36 This guy really, really,
02:04:38 he really planned this one out
02:04:39 and the plan worked perfectly.
02:04:42 I tip my hat to you, sir.
02:04:45 I've been bested.
02:04:47 Okay.
02:04:49 Next one is called Killer Prince 930.
02:04:53 Three, two, one, go.
02:04:55 Hey, listen to my speech impression.
02:04:58 Oh, Hannah, my father-in-law.
02:05:01 I can also make
02:05:04 an Obama.
02:05:06 No, let me be queer, Michelle.
02:05:10 No, let me be queer, Michelle.
02:05:14 Your stitch was a lot better
02:05:17 than your Obama.
02:05:19 Which one was which?
02:05:22 Which one was stitch?
02:05:24 You mean? No, you don't.
02:05:26 No, that's not what you meant.
02:05:27 I mean, there's only two things
02:05:28 I could have said that.
02:05:30 Post image.
02:05:32 This one, this is a link,
02:05:35 but it doesn't work.
02:05:37 Wait, it's got to work.
02:05:39 It doesn't work? Sorry.
02:05:41 No.
02:05:42 This post image link doesn't work.
02:05:44 Next one.
02:05:45 You should test it.
02:05:46 I don't know whether, like,
02:05:48 SpeakPipe shortens titles,
02:05:51 but double check, please,
02:05:53 that your links work before you post it.
02:05:55 Wait, what if I just did the part
02:05:57 in front of that last slash?
02:06:00 Does this one work?
02:06:02 No, it doesn't work either.
02:06:04 Sorry, it doesn't work.
02:06:07 Okay, next one is called Hi Ben.
02:06:09 What's your opinion on Super Smash Bros.
02:06:11 3, 2, 1, go.
02:06:15 Okay, I think it's just empty.
02:06:17 I'm not...
02:06:20 I like it, it's fun, I guess.
02:06:21 It's fun to play.
02:06:22 Sometimes I'm not very good at it.
02:06:24 The only people who...
02:06:27 Well, I used to play it sometimes
02:06:29 with my roommates, which could be fun.
02:06:31 Nowadays, the only people I would ever
02:06:33 play Smash Bros. with are the people
02:06:35 at Munchie's house,
02:06:37 and those guys are way better than me
02:06:40 to the point that I just can't play with them.
02:06:42 Yeah, yeah.
02:06:43 They're just playing a different game
02:06:45 than I am, so I don't really play it anymore.
02:06:49 It's fine, I was never like a huge
02:06:51 fighting game guy anyway.
02:06:53 I was pretty similar.
02:06:54 It was fun when I was young,
02:06:56 because I could, like,
02:06:58 spam, like, Samus's, like,
02:07:01 be over and over again,
02:07:04 and get them every time.
02:07:06 And then, they got the, you know,
02:07:09 whoever I was playing with, they just grew up,
02:07:11 they learned how to play, and I didn't.
02:07:14 Now I can't play the game anymore,
02:07:16 so I just have not bought the new one.
02:07:18 Remember, remember, if you will,
02:07:21 the slime fest where me and Munchie played,
02:07:23 we battled in Smash Bros. Brawl,
02:07:25 and it was the least fun thing
02:07:28 that has ever happened to me
02:07:30 in my entire life.
02:07:33 Because I just, I just don't know the game
02:07:36 at the same level.
02:07:38 I just don't know what I'm doing.
02:07:40 That's not the game's fault.
02:07:42 Okay, next one is an Imgur link.
02:07:44 Remember this?
02:07:46 Hey, look at this.
02:07:47 Yeah, yeah.
02:07:48 Remember this?
02:07:49 Well, egg on my face.
02:07:50 Benz, dudes be like,
02:07:52 don't reply to me weirdo.
02:07:53 My brother in Christ,
02:07:54 you made the reply with the soul utility
02:07:56 of being incendiary.
02:07:57 I've since changed my mind,
02:07:59 realized I hate this discourse.
02:08:01 So now I'm the one whose message
02:08:03 unprompted an unwanted response.
02:08:04 How rich, Benz St. undefeated once again.
02:08:06 I am genuinely...
02:08:08 That's character development.
02:08:10 I'm genuinely, honestly,
02:08:12 I wasn't, after thinking about it for a second,
02:08:14 I wasn't that mad about the first one,
02:08:16 although I still disagreed with it.
02:08:17 I'm genuinely impressed
02:08:19 by the level of like,
02:08:21 I thought about what I said
02:08:23 and I've come to a new opinion about it.
02:08:26 I feel like this is an...
02:08:28 What's the word?
02:08:29 An uncommon level of like,
02:08:32 self-reflection has been displayed here.
02:08:35 Um, I...
02:08:37 Yeah.
02:08:38 It kind of is, it kind of is true.
02:08:40 You also said something
02:08:43 to frustrate me.
02:08:45 Anyway, all water into the bridge.
02:08:47 Man.
02:08:49 Good meme, actually.
02:08:52 Fuck that dumb bitch and her stupid baby
02:08:55 talk.
02:08:58 Let's kill her.
02:08:59 Next one is
02:09:01 the quantifiable PCP member formula.
02:09:03 Three, two, one, go.
02:09:06 Alright, listen up, right?
02:09:08 Yeah.
02:09:09 So, you know,
02:09:10 Ben and Gibbon take,
02:09:12 they have all these sorts of guests
02:09:14 and they're on all the time,
02:09:16 but they're not members of the PCP,
02:09:18 so you claim.
02:09:19 Now, how do you quantify a member of the PCP?
02:09:22 Let me tell you, okay?
02:09:24 You might remember him.
02:09:25 There's a man named Jeff Thu.
02:09:27 And he was at one point
02:09:29 considered a host of the procrastinator's podcast
02:09:32 and he was only on three episodes, okay?
02:09:35 So, I think, quantifiably,
02:09:37 that means that any guest
02:09:39 that's been on the PCP more than three times,
02:09:42 an official member of the PCP now,
02:09:44 you kick them off.
02:09:45 Like, you kicked Jeff off.
02:09:47 We did not kick Jeff off.
02:09:49 Fuckin' cheesy manfredo, PCP.
02:09:52 Gamer's Tavern, PCP.
02:09:54 It's fuckin' all PCP all the time,
02:09:56 Ben's saying.
02:09:57 It's all PCP.
02:09:59 You can't escape it, Ben.
02:10:01 I'm really fuckin' high right now.
02:10:03 I can't believe it.
02:10:04 Okay.
02:10:07 Oh, boy.
02:10:08 Okay.
02:10:09 Ben's saying,
02:10:10 I hate your guts,
02:10:11 but you have a good podcast.
02:10:12 Thanks, man.
02:10:13 Fuckin' keep doin' what you're doin'.
02:10:14 Woo!
02:10:15 If you're there, hi.
02:10:16 I like you.
02:10:17 I have no problems with you.
02:10:19 Yeah, thanks.
02:10:20 Bye.
02:10:21 Thanks, dude.
02:10:24 We didn't technically kick Jeff.
02:10:26 We basically just...
02:10:28 We and Jeff mutually agreed,
02:10:30 you're not really a part of his podcast.
02:10:33 Yeah, I think he just sort of left at some point.
02:10:37 There was a very brief period where
02:10:39 Blind Skywatcher was in the chat.
02:10:41 What?
02:10:42 Do you remember that?
02:10:43 No.
02:10:45 Trixie brought them in.
02:10:48 I don't know whether they were to be
02:10:51 a member of the Progress News,
02:10:53 but it was just a friend.
02:10:55 And they were cool,
02:10:56 but they didn't interact either,
02:10:57 so they left.
02:10:58 Yeah.
02:11:00 A member is just whoever we say is a member.
02:11:05 That's it.
02:11:07 We're just...
02:11:09 We're just not...
02:11:10 That's it.
02:11:11 That's it.
02:11:13 That's the answer.
02:11:14 The member...
02:11:15 To be a member
02:11:16 means you have to have gone to Brony Khan.
02:11:20 Yeah.
02:11:23 And no one has done that, except us.
02:11:25 That's the disqualifier.
02:11:28 Next one is called
02:11:29 This voicemail has lore,
02:11:31 three, two, one, go.
02:11:34 Oh, God!
02:11:36 The name-fuckers are here.
02:11:38 I left a voicemail
02:11:40 saying they were cringe a year ago,
02:11:42 and now they've come for me.
02:11:43 Oh, God!
02:11:44 That's insane.
02:11:45 What have I done?
02:11:47 What have I robbed?
02:11:48 That's insane.
02:11:50 They teamed up with Sotchu.
02:11:52 They have dragons.
02:11:54 They're fucking here, bro.
02:11:56 They have dragons.
02:11:57 Oh, my God.
02:12:01 Yeah.
02:12:02 Well, what did you fucking expect?
02:12:05 You called the name-fuckers cringe,
02:12:06 and they didn't get to fuck Nate,
02:12:07 so, like, where do you think they're going to go?
02:12:11 Final Fantasy VII.
02:12:14 They have dragons.
02:12:19 And Sotchu.
02:12:20 Man, that is lore.
02:12:22 That's accurate.
02:12:24 Okay, next one is called
02:12:25 Nate Theory, three, two, one, go.
02:12:29 All right, I've got a theory
02:12:30 about what happened to Nate, okay?
02:12:32 Now, listen up.
02:12:33 Listen up, you fucking sheephole
02:12:35 that believes the real story.
02:12:37 The real story.
02:12:38 Thank you, Mr. Truth.
02:12:39 Here's what happened, okay?
02:12:42 Nate, the best guy ever, fucking died.
02:12:45 He's dead.
02:12:46 He slipped and fell and hit his head
02:12:48 during a shower speed run.
02:12:50 And that's why he hasn't
02:12:51 just been on the PCP now.
02:12:52 He's thinking, like, he's streamed, right?
02:12:54 But how?
02:12:56 It's Ben's saying.
02:12:58 He has a weekend at Bernie's saying,
02:13:00 Nate's corpse to spread a narrative
02:13:03 that he is not dead,
02:13:04 but he can't be,
02:13:05 they can't be in the same place
02:13:06 at the same time,
02:13:07 because Ben is Nate,
02:13:08 so that's why he's not on the PCP anymore.
02:13:11 Case closed.
02:13:12 Well, I guess he cracked it.
02:13:14 Yeah, I like the shower speed run,
02:13:17 because that's around the time
02:13:19 Nate stopped coming on,
02:13:20 is when that was...
02:13:21 He slipped and fell and died
02:13:23 during a shower speed run.
02:13:24 We can't let this get out.
02:13:26 We can't let this get out anyway.
02:13:28 We've got to retain the sanctity
02:13:30 of the shower speed run.
02:13:31 We've got to keep people doing that.
02:13:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:13:33 We can't let them know that it's dangerous.
02:13:35 If we let them know that one of our own guys
02:13:38 slipped and fell and died
02:13:39 during a shower speed run,
02:13:40 then we'll be liable
02:13:42 when other people inevitably do that,
02:13:44 and we don't want that kind of responsibility, so...
02:13:49 You know, the rest is history.
02:13:50 Next one is called,
02:13:52 Is Gib Dead?
02:13:53 Three, two...
02:13:54 Well, Gib?
02:13:55 I don't know.
02:13:56 Let's see their case.
02:13:57 Let's find out.
02:13:58 Three, two, one, go.
02:14:00 Hey, Gib...
02:14:02 Did...
02:14:03 Last year you talked a lot about
02:14:05 your mystery illness.
02:14:09 Did you ever get that, like,
02:14:10 sorted out or figure out
02:14:11 what it actually was?
02:14:13 Are you doing better?
02:14:14 Are you dead?
02:14:16 You don't have to answer
02:14:17 if you don't want to.
02:14:18 I was just worried.
02:14:21 Seagulls in the background.
02:14:23 Seagulls on a pirate ship right now.
02:14:27 I am not dead.
02:14:29 What it was was...
02:14:32 Well, it was...
02:14:33 It's still a mystery,
02:14:35 exactly what it was
02:14:37 caused by,
02:14:39 but I was, like,
02:14:40 extremely low on vitamin D,
02:14:42 and I had to take supplements.
02:14:45 I guess because I was inside a lot.
02:14:47 I feel like I'm inside a lot anyway.
02:14:51 My vitamin D was low.
02:14:52 I have a hunch that it had to do with, like,
02:14:56 like, weird doses of, like,
02:14:59 the HRT I was taking.
02:15:04 I'm taking it still,
02:15:05 but, like, it's fine now,
02:15:06 so I'm not entirely sure what it was.
02:15:10 At the time I was living somewhere different,
02:15:12 so it could have been something in that place.
02:15:15 I don't know,
02:15:18 but I'm alright.
02:15:20 I'm fine.
02:15:21 Well, I'm glad that's over.
02:15:24 Yeah.
02:15:26 Yeah, weird.
02:15:28 It could also be, like, a number of things,
02:15:30 like, little things colliding.
02:15:32 Like, maybe I was eating badly,
02:15:34 as well as all those other things.
02:15:36 I don't know.
02:15:37 So you're saying you faked it?
02:15:38 I'm saying I faked it for attention.
02:15:40 I got loads of money.
02:15:41 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:15:42 Alright, alright, alright.
02:15:43 As long as you made a turn to profit.
02:15:45 As long as you faked it.
02:15:46 As long as you faked it and made money.
02:15:49 Okay, next one is called Fuck Trixie.
02:15:52 3, 2, 1, go.
02:15:54 Shut up, man.
02:15:55 No!
02:15:58 They got you.
02:16:01 Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder Play Delta Rune Chapter 2.
02:16:06 Okay, some day.
02:16:08 Next one is called Oblivion Fuck.
02:16:10 3, 2, 1, go.
02:16:12 In Episode 295, Oblivion 4 said he'd upload all of his compilations of voicemails
02:16:16 to the ThemSnakes channel by the end of February.
02:16:18 And then the comments he said might take until March.
02:16:21 And now it's halfway through fucking April and they're still not there.
02:16:23 Where are they?
02:16:24 I saw him.
02:16:25 I think they are up now, right?
02:16:28 I think I saw a video.
02:16:30 Oh, did you?
02:16:31 I saw him replying to a YouTube comment this week saying that he would do it soon.
02:16:38 So maybe he did.
02:16:39 I don't know.
02:16:40 I could swear I saw it posted somewhere kind of recently, like within a day or so.
02:16:50 I don't know which chat it was in though, so I can't find it.
02:16:54 I don't know.
02:16:55 I don't remember which channel he said he was going to upload it on to.
02:16:58 It's either up already or he says he's going to put it up like soon.
02:17:02 It was on the ThemSnakes?
02:17:06 Well, maybe it was unlisted on ThemSnakes because it's not public.
02:17:11 Man, I don't know.
02:17:12 He said he was going to post it.
02:17:15 Like yesterday or the day before, I saw him reply to a comment saying like,
02:17:18 yeah, I'm going to do it like tomorrow.
02:17:20 So probably soon.
02:17:23 He's been saying that he wants to get that up and people have been asking him for it.
02:17:28 Next one is called Ukraine Loves Nazis 321 Go.
02:17:52 Yeah, I think after that episode finished, I went to look into that particular thing
02:18:12 and I came to the same conclusions.
02:18:16 It was a Russian propaganda thing to make it look like.
02:18:21 And so it was like, that's why the U.K., the U.S. and Ukraine voted against.
02:18:27 And everywhere, the country abstained because they just didn't want to get involved, I guess.
02:18:33 It was not what it seemed as on the tin.
02:18:38 As these things often, they get blown out of the work.
02:18:42 I guess it worked then because now they can show that graph being like C,
02:18:46 only the United States and Ukraine voted against it.
02:18:49 Yeah, that's sort of the point.
02:18:52 Well, I don't know if that's the point of doing it in the first place,
02:18:55 but certainly a result of it is that people who do not look into it too hard
02:19:00 get the impression that that's what it's saying and then they just use it as a point.
02:19:05 They could just post it.
02:19:07 I see.
02:19:08 Okay, next one is called Slime Times Exposed 321 Go.
02:19:14 RFCK is socket.
02:19:17 RFCK is stinks.
02:19:20 It's endless words.
02:19:21 It's a shitty game, shitty community.
02:19:25 They'll take you and they'll cheer you out and spit you back out.
02:19:31 They'll all betray you.
02:19:33 The game itself isn't even fun.
02:19:36 Killers just fucking cheat.
02:19:38 That's the whole thing.
02:19:39 They just openly love exploiting and abusing.
02:19:43 They're just making the game not fun for anybody.
02:19:46 And then the Raddies are fucking cowards.
02:19:48 They just enable it.
02:19:50 Which bar is this guy at drinking?
02:19:53 He's at the king's wife's son.
02:19:59 Going out there loud and proud.
02:20:00 Like they're king ones, whatever.
02:20:03 Fucking starting an open and honest conversation.
02:20:08 Don't do it.
02:20:09 Don't listen to that.
02:20:10 Literally, your profile comes in every week.
02:20:12 Fucking tells you to play RFCK.
02:20:15 He's just tempting you.
02:20:16 He's literally a demon.
02:20:18 He's a fucking snake.
02:20:22 We just talk like if you don't believe me.
02:20:24 He's literally a demon.
02:20:26 That's true.
02:20:27 Don't do it.
02:20:28 I've seen him.
02:20:29 Thank you.
02:20:32 Thank you?
02:20:33 Yeah, he's like...
02:20:36 He's crying into his...
02:20:41 Oh, I forget if there's a name for like a slime beer.
02:20:44 There might be one.
02:20:45 But he's crying into his...
02:20:49 His slime and tonic over about how...
02:20:52 The Raddies just enable the killers.
02:20:55 They just exploit and everything.
02:20:57 Culture death.
02:20:59 I lost all my slime and it sucks.
02:21:04 That's thematic though.
02:21:05 I appreciate it.
02:21:06 That's in line with the vibe.
02:21:09 You've got to have some losers, you know?
02:21:12 You've got to have some losers.
02:21:15 Mary slime and alia to all.
02:21:18 Even the haters and losers.
02:21:21 If you, if you, listener want to be just like this guy,
02:21:25 a loser, go play RFCK.
02:21:31 Next one is called...
02:21:33 Am I like Ben Hughes autistic for making voicemails?
02:21:37 Three, two, one, go.
02:21:40 Damn.
02:21:41 This Ben Hus person.
02:21:42 You know, Simpsons of Blue Ninjas person.
02:21:45 You said how they waste a bunch of time on this because of their condition.
02:21:48 Ben Hus.
02:21:49 I am spending a lot of time on voicemails too.
02:21:51 I am so on the spectrum, oh god.
02:21:53 But it is pretty fun to see just what you are capable of,
02:21:56 even if it's not perfect and doesn't even always work out.
02:22:00 There is joy in creating something from scratch, crafting a story.
02:22:04 This guy's standards for a story just slightly lower than mine.
02:22:07 That's all there is to it, really.
02:22:09 I did actually download Sony Vegas and Vocaload.
02:22:12 Just you wait.
02:22:13 I will learn to write proper music just to mess with you, Ben.
02:22:16 Just you wait.
02:22:17 I won't mess with Gib.
02:22:19 Only compliment.
02:22:20 Then it's funny to mess with.
02:22:22 Gib is fun when Gib's shy.
02:22:24 Instead of Elden Ring Gib, God, it's Elden Ring Gib cute.
02:22:28 Thank you.
02:22:32 Thank you, Twilight.
02:22:34 Is there more?
02:22:36 Is that a pig?
02:22:40 Maybe.
02:22:43 Okay.
02:22:45 Yeah, the more time you spend on something, the more autistic you are.
02:22:49 Yeah.
02:22:50 It's a metric for how much you care.
02:22:54 You go to your doctor.
02:22:56 They say, how many autisms am I exuding?
02:22:59 Like in radiation, they get a little machine out.
02:23:02 And they say, how much time this week did you spend on an activity that brings you joy?
02:23:08 And you say, some doctor.
02:23:11 And they'll say, well, then you're somewhat autistic now.
02:23:14 Get out of here.
02:23:18 That'll be $100, please.
02:23:23 So true.
02:23:25 Next one.
02:23:27 Well, there's a Twitter link, and there's also a voicemail to go with it.
02:23:32 So I guess the Twitter link is to, from this at drinking moth, is this animation.
02:23:39 Which is a reply...
02:23:42 It's a reply to teleperte.
02:23:46 There's a teleperte animation here.
02:23:48 Okay, let's listen to it.
02:23:50 Three, two, one, go.
02:23:52 So anyway, did you ever notice how the coolest animation has crazy camera movement?
02:23:57 Talput always has something going from front to back.
02:23:59 Perspective movement is my sexuality.
02:24:01 No, no, no.
02:24:02 Let me try this again.
02:24:04 Perspective movement is my sexuality.
02:24:06 Is my sexuality.
02:24:08 Like this clip is so simple, but those two hushes had so much.
02:24:12 This is why we don't like top-down perspective games, probably.
02:24:18 I mean, they're saying that they really like how the animation includes the box moving in perspective.
02:24:28 Which is true.
02:24:29 Is this person drinking moth, or are they...
02:24:32 I don't know.
02:24:34 I don't think they are.
02:24:38 But they might be.
02:24:40 But they didn't say that they are.
02:24:43 I feel like I've seen that at somewhere before.
02:24:49 Yeah, me too.
02:24:51 Are they following me?
02:24:52 Yeah, no, they're probably drinking moth.
02:24:54 Yeah, probably.
02:24:56 There's a nice little animation.
02:24:58 I mean, I like perspective.
02:25:01 It's good.
02:25:02 You should follow Ululilia, who really likes parallax scrolling.
02:25:13 Sorry, it's our reply on Twitter that I'm going to ignore.
02:25:18 It's not pertinent to what's going on right now.
02:25:22 Next one is called, Are voicemails dead? 3, 2, 1, go.
02:25:27 Okay, the answer is yes.
02:25:30 That was the last one.
02:25:32 Next one is...
02:25:34 Okay, it's another drinking moth link, which is not embedding.
02:25:41 Whatever, I'll just open it up on Twitter.
02:25:44 I got reincarnated as a Lithuanian girl, but I need to take revenge on Benzane
02:25:49 for stealing the Kawasaki scroll.
02:25:53 This image will be seen by the right person at the right time,
02:25:56 though I believe it will be next week, not this one.
02:25:59 Is that Mage?
02:26:01 That's the idea, I think.
02:26:04 Yeah.
02:26:07 Funny that you wouldn't make her purple then.
02:26:10 Okay, well...
02:26:13 What's the voicemail?
02:26:15 Oh yeah, let's listen to the voicemail.
02:26:17 3, 2, 1, go.
02:26:35 Did you translate the name Saint?
02:26:38 It's said like Benzakoni or something.
02:26:41 I think they translated the word Saint, which is dumb.
02:26:45 Benno santo san.
02:26:48 It's Benno santo san, yeah.
02:26:51 Well, I'm laughing.
02:26:54 I'm not sure if this is Mage or just some girl.
02:26:59 Other than being Lithuanian, there doesn't seem much Magey about her.
02:27:03 I think it's not literally Mage,
02:27:06 but the thing they're going for is the reference to Magey's violent childhood.
02:27:12 Yeah, yeah.
02:27:14 Her battle warrior youth in Lithuania.
02:27:19 Yes, I think so, which is fair.
02:27:23 What is this thing she's holding? Is it like a staff?
02:27:27 I thought it was a scroll, not a scroll, a katana that's wrapped up.
02:27:31 Wait, it says, hold on, there's something written on it.
02:27:34 Enhance? Oh, it says at drinking moth.
02:27:37 It looks to me like a gnarled wizard staff that's been wrapped up in leather
02:27:42 and slung across the shoulder like one might sling a guitar.
02:27:46 So, I don't know, that's my best guess.
02:27:53 Good stuff, good stuff, drinking moth.
02:27:57 Next one is, to give spoilers for Sonic 2.
02:28:01 They show Shadow after the crit.
02:28:04 Three, two, one, go.
02:28:07 Gib and listen to me.
02:28:09 What?
02:28:11 Watch the Sonic 2, the hedgehog movie, whenever, however you can.
02:28:16 Watch a camera or something.
02:28:18 Spoilers, it sort of follows the story of Sonic 3 and Knuckles.
02:28:25 And then, after that, it's going to follow the Sonic Adventure 2 timeline.
02:28:31 And if you know anything about Sonic Adventure 2, Ruge the Bat shows up.
02:28:37 And they're going to have big, old, bouncing titties.
02:28:41 Yeah!
02:28:43 4K on the big screen.
02:28:47 Wait, you're saying that, does that happen in Sonic 2?
02:28:51 Or is it going to happen in Sonic 3?
02:28:53 Well, if the character of Ruge the Bat is in the next one, because I know that Shadow is a hedgehog.
02:28:59 Isn't it Rogue the Bat?
02:29:01 No, Ruge.
02:29:02 Is it Ruge?
02:29:03 Oh, fuck.
02:29:05 Ruge is in like femme fatale sort of.
02:29:07 Yeah, yeah, makeup, yeah.
02:29:10 But like, the, I know that Shadow was like hinted at at the credits of the Sonic 2 movie.
02:29:20 So Shadow will be in the next one, and then with Shadow comes Ruge probably.
02:29:27 And then that robot guy, the Eggman robot that goes good.
02:29:33 Oh, E1M1. Yeah, I know the one you're talking about.
02:29:39 Yeah.
02:29:40 The Rogue.
02:29:41 I would be very interested to see...
02:29:43 There's no way they'll put him in.
02:29:45 He's too specific.
02:29:46 He's specifically in Sonic Adventure 2.
02:29:48 They'll never put him in anything again.
02:29:50 They put him in...
02:29:51 He was in Sonic Heroes as well.
02:29:54 Oh, was he?
02:29:55 In the dark trio.
02:29:57 Each team has a trio of things, and it's like Shadow, Ruge, and the robot.
02:30:04 It was a different robot though, right?
02:30:06 I thought it was the same one.
02:30:07 I think it was also in Sonic the Six.
02:30:09 I remembered that it was just a similar robot.
02:30:14 But maybe.
02:30:17 Okay.
02:30:18 I feel like he's a recurring enough character to be in there.
02:30:21 And the idea of it like a robot from Eggman going Rogue and being a good guy...
02:30:27 I don't know.
02:30:28 I think that was...
02:30:30 Yeah, it's a whole...
02:30:31 Interesting story thing to add in.
02:30:34 It is.
02:30:35 That's true.
02:30:36 It would make sense.
02:30:37 I feel like he's an even more minor character than someone like...
02:30:42 Is it Vex the Alligator?
02:30:44 Is that his name?
02:30:45 I don't know their names, but yeah.
02:30:48 I feel like he's even less important than that alligator.
02:30:52 And that alligator is not good.
02:30:54 He might make a cameo.
02:30:55 I don't know.
02:30:56 In any case, if Shadow's in there, they'll probably have Ruge.
02:31:01 And I would be interested to see how big the boobies become for a family movie.
02:31:11 Because her design is so like...
02:31:14 Boob-centric.
02:31:15 Boob-centric.
02:31:16 That's nice.
02:31:17 Sexually bad.
02:31:18 A little bit.
02:31:19 I mean, if you look at the original models from the games, they're not like...
02:31:27 They'll probably cover up for a film, I feel like.
02:31:30 But not that much, but will they?
02:31:34 That's the most important thing.
02:31:36 She was an original...
02:31:38 Oh, wow.
02:31:39 Yeah, they're actually really big in Sonic Adventure 2.
02:31:42 They're actually really prominent, I forgot.
02:31:45 Wow, okay.
02:31:47 Yeah, maybe.
02:31:48 Ruge the Bat.
02:31:50 Which one's Sonic Adventure 2?
02:31:53 Yeah, I feel like they'll tone him down a little bit from this.
02:32:00 Next one is...
02:32:03 An image.
02:32:05 No, it's a YouTube link.
02:32:07 Yeah, you're right, sorry.
02:32:08 It's a YouTube link.
02:32:10 I bet this one's gonna suck.
02:32:12 That's just some gay.
02:32:14 It's another review.
02:32:15 It's a review... whatever.
02:32:17 Okay, I'm not watching it.
02:32:19 Bye.
02:32:20 Next one is an Imgur.
02:32:22 There we go.
02:32:24 Oh, so Beno Saintos.
02:32:26 I'm directing Ben Sento.
02:32:29 Ben Sento.
02:32:31 Because of Ben Affleck's Wikipedia, there are evidence of Ben Shapiro.
02:32:38 Oh, that's very interesting.
02:32:42 Yeah, okay, I guess Ben.
02:32:44 I guess you just say Ben.
02:32:46 Ben?
02:32:47 Is N the only consonant?
02:32:49 Ben.
02:32:50 Is that the only consonant sound in Japanese that doesn't have a vowel?
02:32:56 Maybe there's not.
02:32:58 Because I thought most of Japanese consonants were like...
02:33:07 Well, they have N.
02:33:09 You can't really...
02:33:11 But is that the only one?
02:33:13 I don't know, I don't speak any language at all.
02:33:17 Okay, we'll fair enough.
02:33:21 We've all learned some.
02:33:23 I like that it's...
02:33:25 I'm looking at the symbol for no is just that curved line.
02:33:29 And the symbol for N is a very similar curved line, but with like another dash on top of it.
02:33:36 I find that fascinating.
02:33:41 Next one...
02:33:44 I lost my place, sorry.
02:33:46 Okay, next one is called Crisis Averted.
02:33:48 Three, two, one, go.
02:33:51 Thank God.
02:33:53 Last week I thought I started HRT on Ben's birthday and like...
02:33:57 That would have been too cringe.
02:33:59 Could you imagine I would have had to de-transition out of embarrassment?
02:34:06 The only thing more cringe than starting HRT is starting it on Ben's birthday.
02:34:11 Thanks for clarifying, and happy belated birthday, Ben Saint.
02:34:16 Thank you.
02:34:20 Next one is called Re Phantomhorn, one of two, three, two, one, go.
02:34:26 Ben Saint, your game Phantom's Revenge?
02:34:30 That was a lot of fun.
02:34:32 I just have one request.
02:34:34 May I, pretty pleased with the cherry on top, have permission to draw fan art of your OC Phantomhorn?
02:34:42 No.
02:34:45 Thanks for asking, no.
02:34:51 Ask for permission if you don't want to do it.
02:34:55 Always ask for permission if you hate yourself.
02:35:01 Sorry, the answer was yes by default, but when you ask, it flips that switch.
02:35:06 I'm sorry, these are the rules that I made up.
02:35:09 Next one is Re Phantomhorn, two of two.
02:35:12 We'll listen to it first, three, two, one, go.
02:35:16 Surprise, bitch.
02:35:19 Happy belated birthday, Ben Saint.
02:35:22 Curious Phantomhorn getting squished by a train.
02:35:26 No, no.
02:35:29 Okay, let's see.
02:35:31 Oh, no.
02:35:33 Wait, is this post-squish?
02:35:35 He's got stars swinging around his head.
02:35:38 That hurt a little bit.
02:35:41 Yeah, I guess it must be.
02:35:43 Damn, he looks pretty good for having just been run over by a train.
02:35:46 Yeah, he's probably made of that gumu gumu gumu, you know?
02:35:52 Yeah, because Luffy ate the Nika Nika fruit.
02:35:57 So actually, the real gumu gumu fruit, Phantomhorn, just found it in the trash one day,
02:36:02 and just ate it by accident, as he often does.
02:36:06 I like his hoodie.
02:36:08 I actually gave him a little pink hoodie with a black one.
02:36:11 That looks cool, I like it.
02:36:15 Oh, this is pre-slime, he has the old horn.
02:36:19 I mean, if he had the slime, he would definitely survive being run over by a train.
02:36:23 Yeah.
02:36:24 Obviously, but this is pre-so, it's a little scary.
02:36:28 Okay, next one is...
02:36:31 Oh, next one is...
02:36:34 Thank you, by the way, I like it, I love it.
02:36:37 Next one is Ben's weekly reminder to upload these episodes to Spotify.
02:36:40 I will, I will.
02:36:42 Well, I'll do my best.
02:36:44 I don't know if it will work, because I've never done it before.
02:36:47 Okay, next one is a YouTube link.
02:36:50 It's a link to the garlic house music video.
02:36:53 Okay, cool.
02:36:55 You want us to talk about it? We already talked about it.
02:36:57 We already talked about it.
02:36:58 It's cringe.
02:37:00 It's cringe, but I'm glad it exists.
02:37:03 Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
02:37:04 Watch the garlic house music video, it's funny.
02:37:07 It's painful, but it's funny.
02:37:10 Check it out if you want to have a fucking rollicking good time.
02:37:14 Okay, next one is an Imgirlink.
02:37:17 It's a...
02:37:19 CHCW.
02:37:21 Oh, it's CHCW.
02:37:23 Who's that?
02:37:24 This is the guy who always comments, no Nate, no watch.
02:37:27 See you next week.
02:37:29 Oh, I see.
02:37:31 Yeah, his name is SHCWVideos, and yet his channel has no videos.
02:37:37 I wonder what the SHCW stands for.
02:37:40 I also wonder that.
02:37:42 Maybe you can let us know in the comments, along with your typical response.
02:37:49 If you feel so inclined, I'd be curious to know.
02:37:52 Thank you.
02:37:54 Okay, we're almost done.
02:37:56 Wow, we're almost through these.
02:37:58 Yeah, a lot of them are just YouTube links that we're not...
02:38:01 That's another Yig one.
02:38:03 Why? Yeah, I'm not gonna have anything to say about any particular video.
02:38:08 I am not subscribed to the cultural conversation nor the channel.
02:38:15 Yeah, there's just nothing to say about this.
02:38:20 Next one is called Introducing Poogee.
02:38:23 Poogee? Poogee?
02:38:25 Three, two, one, go.
02:38:27 So since you don't hate pigs, I thought formal greetings are in order.
02:38:32 This is Poogee.
02:38:34 Poogee, say hello.
02:38:38 Oh, pig it.
02:38:39 Holy shit.
02:38:40 He whistles.
02:38:41 Did Upload and Fall just follow me on Twitter?
02:38:47 Oh god, I am dying again.
02:38:49 Aren't I?
02:38:50 Oh well, better get over with it.
02:38:57 Hello?
02:38:59 Well shit, now what do we do?
02:39:03 It's the pig.
02:39:05 The pig was at the door.
02:39:08 There's a pig at the door.
02:39:10 Damn, that's a horror story for me personally.
02:39:15 I like Poogee.
02:39:18 She said Poogee.
02:39:21 She said Poogee, so I'm gonna assume it's meant to be Poogee.
02:39:26 Unless you typo it in the voicemail.
02:39:30 We have to protect Poogee from the pig.
02:39:33 From the big, from his big evil cousin.
02:39:36 Poogee's good.
02:39:37 Poogee can grow up to be, he can make something of himself, not like that psychopath.
02:39:43 Next one is a YouTube link, WaitHe'sReal at gmail.com.
02:39:48 Oh, it's a link, it's a video about Brad Garlinghouse.
02:39:52 It's Brad Garlinghouse.
02:39:53 Yes, Brad Garlinghouse is a real human person with real human feelings
02:39:58 and a real human cryptocurrency that you can buy right now.
02:40:02 It's Ripple, baby!
02:40:04 That's it, that's the last voicemail, we did it.
02:40:08 It wasn't even that bad.
02:40:10 What do you think?
02:40:12 I said that's the last voicemail, we actually did it.
02:40:15 It wasn't as bad as I thought.
02:40:17 Yeah, yeah.
02:40:19 It's a good day.
02:40:22 It's a good day, I'm feeling good.
02:40:24 I got up early to finish my, to finish that Tails Gets Trolled page
02:40:27 and now we've done the podcast in it under three hours.
02:40:30 Yes!
02:40:32 There's a few people who are crying right now.
02:40:35 A few people say no!
02:40:36 I saw someone...
02:40:38 I have two more hours to work my shift digging ditches at the graveyard.
02:40:43 I'm sorry about those people.
02:40:46 Yeah, somebody on the last episode, it was four hours long
02:40:50 and they're like, ah, could you please make a five hour episode?
02:40:54 Yeah, come on!
02:40:57 Come on, only four!
02:40:59 Just, why?
02:41:01 Just keep it going, man!
02:41:03 Yeah.
02:41:05 No, I will, alright.
02:41:07 I will put those bonus episodes up.
02:41:09 I will attempt to get that shit on Spotify
02:41:12 and Apple Podcasts and whatever else.
02:41:16 Hopefully before this episode goes live
02:41:19 and take out my Tails Gets Trolled page.
02:41:23 Link in the description, check out my Tails Gets Trolled page.
02:41:25 I've worked really hard on it.
02:41:27 Yes.
02:41:29 And we have to keep posting to the Patreon.
02:41:33 We have to remember that.
02:41:35 Yeah, I don't think I'm going to forget again.
02:41:39 I'm really mad, I'm really fucking mad about that.
02:41:43 But it's too late to do anything.
02:41:46 Yeah.
02:41:48 We were considering like posting all of the episodes individually
02:41:54 and people would get charged for them this month.
02:41:57 But I feel like that would have scared people
02:42:00 and made them like unpledge
02:42:02 because there's like a bunch of stuff happening at once.
02:42:04 All that would do is a few people would just get charged like eight times for one month
02:42:10 and it would be shitty for them.
02:42:12 And most people would probably, it would just exceed their monthly limits that they place
02:42:17 and it wouldn't even like get,
02:42:20 it wouldn't make, it would make a little bit of the money back,
02:42:23 but not most of it.
02:42:25 So like, I don't, yeah, I don't even think it's worth.
02:42:28 We just got, we just got a call.
02:42:30 We just got a call March of March of a lost month.
02:42:33 It's a bummer.
02:42:34 It's a bummer, but hopefully the patrons,
02:42:36 hopefully you patrons will consider it a gift.
02:42:40 A lucky strike.
02:42:42 Yes.
02:42:43 As they say.
02:42:44 And pay us by pledging to the patron at $5 to get access to the Minecraft server
02:42:53 and have fun in that video game that you love so much.
02:42:56 I wouldn't say no.
02:42:57 I wouldn't say no to that.
02:42:58 Yeah.
02:42:59 Become a patron, get the bonus episodes,
02:43:01 get all the past bonus episodes including the Radcon 2 documentary.
02:43:06 Join the Minecraft server.
02:43:08 Marron Pan will help you get it set up and he will,
02:43:11 surely he will be overjoyed.
02:43:13 If you're, here's the thing.
02:43:15 When you're a PCP patron, you're not just getting the bonus episodes,
02:43:18 you're not just getting the Minecraft server.
02:43:21 You're getting a man-servant who will be overjoyed.
02:43:26 You can, you have a 24 hour helpline that you can DM on Discord and say,
02:43:30 Marron Pan, I can't find the next NPC.
02:43:33 Where's the next step in the quest?
02:43:34 And he'll be like, I'm in.
02:43:36 I'm joining the game.
02:43:37 I'm going to walk you there right now.
02:43:39 I'm confident that nothing would please him more
02:43:42 than to receive queries about his Minecraft server
02:43:46 and be empowered to enable you to appreciate all that's on offer there.
02:43:54 So that's a deal of the lifetime as far as I'm concerned.
02:43:58 Anything else?
02:44:01 Check out my streams if you're interested in watching me.
02:44:05 If you need time to fill and the PCP isn't long enough,
02:44:09 I guess watch my Elden Ring streams on Gibb and Take on Twitch.
02:44:14 Yeah, also, if you want to see Oblivion Fall play both of our games,
02:44:21 Phantom's Revenge and Pumpkin Alley.
02:44:24 You can check out the VOD for that stream he did last week.
02:44:27 It was very fun.
02:44:29 Oh yeah, and check out Pumpkin Alley because there's the pumpkin patch.
02:44:33 It's slightly different and there's more lizards.
02:44:37 I still have not.
02:44:38 I might go and hunt that eighth lizard because he never found that eighth lizard,
02:44:43 but I might.
02:44:45 If I have some free time this week in between doing all that other shit,
02:44:49 maybe I'll hunt a lizard.
02:44:51 Okay, check it out.
02:44:53 That's going to be it.
02:44:55 That's the episode, baby.
02:44:57 That's it.
02:44:58 That's it.
02:44:59 See you next week.
02:45:01 I love you so much.
02:45:04 And you could do anything you put your mind to.
02:45:07 Even subscribe to our YouTube channel.
02:45:11 Okay, goodbye.
02:45:13 See ya later.
02:45:15 See ya.
