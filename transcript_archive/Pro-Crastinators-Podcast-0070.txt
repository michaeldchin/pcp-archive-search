00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best
00:00:19 guy ever and here is Hippocrit. And Munchy is here. Semperfied Delos to all our armed forces.
00:00:41 And just so everybody knows, this is the PCP. It's a show where a bunch of YouTube and other
00:00:47 place content creators, we just get together and we talk about stuff. There's your introduction
00:00:52 if you don't know what this is, that's what it is. Our topic today is The Military. What
00:01:11 an enigma. What can you even say about the military? Nothing. I've got the Urban Dictionary
00:01:24 open. Some of the definitions are lame. So I just went to the one that is like a bunch
00:01:29 of definitions. So here's like the third entry and there's like five of them on here. So
00:01:33 here we go. Military. A government department, it's got like that parentheses S, charged
00:01:40 with defense of national borders, two members of the military department forces in parentheses
00:01:49 for some reason, an armed government department employed to ensure security and home and abroad.
00:01:56 That's clearly a typo. Nobody gives a fuck about Urban Dictionary, I guess. An armed force
00:02:01 used to subdue or oppress groups which oppose governmental policy at home or abroad, and
00:02:06 a designation which bestows virtual sainthood in some cultures. Oh, I get it. That's like
00:02:11 the joke one. Okay, cool. So that's it. That's the military, the armed forces of nations.
00:02:18 I love war. I just want to say that. As a little boy you're told war is bad and you
00:02:25 don't want World War III. I guess I don't want World War III. But then you read about
00:02:30 all the fiction, all the stories, all the real life stories, all the cool things, all
00:02:35 the toys. Military war stuff is the coolest thing ever. War is a great time to rise through
00:02:45 the social ranks. You know this Alexander Hamilton, the play Hamilton, the musical that came out
00:02:50 not too long ago, that everyone tries to be like, oh, Hamilton's such a wonderful guy
00:02:56 and this is a perfect boy. But yeah, he pretty much wanted war so that tons of people would
00:03:01 die. War is not good so that he could rise through the ranks and grow. That was his
00:03:06 opportunity to do so. So he was kind of hoping for that shit nonetheless.
00:03:10 And Nate, you actually went to go see Hamilton, but then the entire cast wouldn't start the
00:03:15 show and they just berate you. And you're accomplice for not not respecting minority
00:03:21 rights and how you need to use your extreme executive power effectively.
00:03:27 That's right.
00:03:28 Like what the fuck?
00:03:29 I didn't appreciate that. That was very rude, but I will work on forgiving them in time.
00:03:33 As I strip away all their civil rights.
00:03:37 I want to clarify. Conflict is terrible. Conflict is like, oh, there's a group of people and
00:03:44 they're being bombed by this nasty guy and then there's other bombs going off and there's
00:03:48 drone strikes. That's boring. That's cowardly. It's terrible.
00:03:52 There's civilian deaths. Don't like civilian deaths. I do like battles with armies. Like
00:03:57 if we were to go to war with a country, let's just say, fuck you, we're going to war. Send
00:04:04 everyone, the robots, the nukes, the whole gang, the whole gang's here.
00:04:11 I love the idea and the romance of battles and war. But if we're talking about the military,
00:04:19 it's pretty fucked up.
00:04:20 That attitude is what started World War I. Everyone was real interested in like, man,
00:04:25 we've got all these militaries. We haven't used our weapons in a while. We've got all
00:04:28 these new ones like this mustard gas bombs and shit. Let's just have a big war. Then
00:04:33 they did and that was World War I and it was a little bit of that.
00:04:37 A little bit.
00:04:38 A little bit.
00:04:39 That's pretty much what started it.
00:04:40 We got to decide first of all, instead of just meandering around the idea of armies
00:04:45 and war and the military, what are we going to discuss about the military? Are we talking
00:04:50 about like in general or like current or American vs. UK military?
00:04:55 We can talk about like historical stuff, but I think more interest, you know, more like
00:05:00 relevant would be like modern military and like its place in the world and what we think
00:05:04 about and what it's doing, all that good stuff. Semper Fidel is to all our armed forces.
00:05:09 Exactly. But I have something far more important, military fashion. The Prussian slash early
00:05:14 empire had the best military fashion, Google search, Franco-Pussian war uniforms for some
00:05:19 fresh shit. You World War I Britain has some good shit too, but fucking debate me. All
00:05:24 fucking pickle helms, that shit were fucking sick. They were great.
00:05:27 I've always had a pension for SS officer uniforms. You know, I'm quite fond of them. I think
00:05:35 they're very attractive looking. The Nazis had impeccable fashion. There's no denying
00:05:39 it, at least for their officers, for their officers.
00:05:42 Barais have never been like cool until the military decided that they were the thing.
00:05:49 I agree. You think of a barais, you think of like a French guy with onions around his
00:05:55 neck and going home, I'm gay, a whole home. They're very afraid of vampires in France.
00:06:00 Yeah. Well, no, it's onions. It's werewolves with onions. Werewolves hate onions, right.
00:06:06 Vampires are like werewolves with onions. And mummies hate parsley. Just wave some parsley
00:06:11 in a mummy's face and you got that boy spooked. I'm pretty sure that's how that works.
00:06:16 Barais, like the British officers types, they're like, I'm in charge and I have a red
00:06:23 beret and I'm cool. And I'm like, yeah, you are. I believe you. You do need to have that
00:06:29 said. Yeah, I agree.
00:06:31 What about, okay, that's true and all, but what do we think about, you know, like, so
00:06:38 times have moved on and like if there were to be like a World War three, it would be
00:06:42 a big deal because the last like big old war, of course, is World War two. And that ended
00:06:48 with the advent of nuclear weapons. So like that's on the table now. And that's a big
00:06:52 deal. And I don't know how much we want to talk about like war, specifically versus
00:06:55 I think, I think if there is going to be a World War three, nobody is going to admit
00:07:01 that it is happening and that it's being called World War three because nobody wants
00:07:06 to live in a world where World War three is happening because so much time has passed
00:07:10 since the, you know, what it was called at the time of the Great War.
00:07:14 It would be really bad PR to have World War three.
00:07:16 It's not about PR, but I'm just thinking like general people, they're always like, oh,
00:07:20 World War three is just around the corner. It may already be happening.
00:07:23 Well, like the Cold War is kind of like the World War three, just in the sense that like
00:07:28 most of the world was divided up between like two sides. And I mean, at least America and
00:07:33 Russia or the USSR and like all its subsidiaries and shit. And then like, but of course, like
00:07:38 the whole, the whole thing there was like, we couldn't afford to escalate that to a bigger
00:07:42 war because if we did, and that's maybe why nuclear weapons are kind of good because they
00:07:46 force you to find other things or else everyone's dead, even though that threats on the table.
00:07:50 You know, if you don't find a way to, to avoid that outside of like, I mean, now that, you
00:07:54 know, nukes are on the table, like you're going to get a nuclear war and that's not so good.
00:07:59 It's not so spicy.
00:08:02 The next time a nuke is used, I think will be
00:08:08 to be a big deal. It's gonna be a big deal. And probably people will say, okay, now it's
00:08:12 happening like now World War three, because like you can't, you can't back down from like,
00:08:16 well, now we're going to try a certain this out peacefully because we knew you know what
00:08:20 the most likely thing for that is. I think that the most likely thing I think that probably
00:08:24 will happen at some point, but it's going to be like some sort of dirty nuclear bomb that
00:08:28 like a terrorist organization gets their hands on somehow, because like more and more countries
00:08:32 are getting their hands on nukes and shit. It's just, you know, the technology is known.
00:08:36 It's out there for like 60 years now. So I think that's going to happen. It's not going
00:08:41 to like destroy a country or anything. It's going to be very bad. And it's going to radiate
00:08:46 like a population somewhere. And it's going to be fucked up. London, I think it's almost
00:08:50 inevitable. Yeah, Olympics, baby. Here we go, drop the bomb.
00:08:55 Fun fact. Did you know that during the Korean War, a U.S. general wanted to just use a nuke
00:09:02 on China, not like on their capital, but just like to like stop their advance, like just
00:09:07 a tactical nuke just wait, wait, do you mean China or Vietnam or Korea? I mean, in the
00:09:13 Korean War, China helped North Korea. I was right. So they wanted to nuke China to stop
00:09:18 the North Korean advancement or something. Yes. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'm fine. Yeah.
00:09:22 Okay. I mean, you know, there's certainly a tactical advantage to using a fucking nuke,
00:09:26 but just think about how like how fast we would all be dead if that were to transpire.
00:09:33 Exactly. Exactly. So I think it's I think the moment that a single nuke is used, we are all
00:09:40 dead. And you might as well just say your yeah, it's it's it's it's kind of that's the nature
00:09:45 of deterrence. It's kind of it's so big a threat that it's kind of hard to wrap your head around
00:09:51 being scared about it. Like at any moment, a country could decide, you know what, we're
00:09:55 going to suddenly start using these. Fuck you. Boom. North Korea, dude, North fucking Korea.
00:10:01 Yeah. And it's like, oh, well, they have nukes and they could nuke us and we could be dead within
00:10:05 a day or two. And if we're not dead, the whole rest of our country will be in nuclear quarantine
00:10:11 and would be enough. All of infrastructure will fall apart and would be in the slums and it'll
00:10:16 be terrible. And you're like, you're thinking about how bad it could possibly be. And you're not
00:10:21 shying away from it, but it's just it's just too big to be like scary in a way that you can
00:10:26 understand. You can't feel that fear until it's like actually happening to you.
00:10:32 The people that are the most interesting to me in there are the South Korean people because like
00:10:37 right across that fucking Waller River, whatever it is, there is North Korea has nukes could easily
00:10:44 drop them on South Korea if they wanted to. And that's the big thing with why, okay, so North Korea
00:10:49 is possibly the most dangerous nation like in the world right now because they're so fucking crazy
00:10:53 and they worship, you know, like this one dude who runs the whole ship and can do whatever the
00:10:57 fuck he wants because he's like a god or something to the people. So like because of that, if we go
00:11:02 in and try to like take that guy out as a lot of people want to because he's just a toxic element
00:11:07 on the world stage, like the most likely thing that would happen is that we can't like instantly
00:11:13 take out all their defenses and they just dump everything they got on South Korea. They're holding
00:11:18 like at least all of Seoul like the capital which is right across the border. They're holding all the
00:11:23 population of Seoul is held captive to prevent like any action against North Korea period.
00:11:29 And like there's just and those people like I was listening to an NPR story I think about like
00:11:34 interviewing what South Koreans think of North Korea. Like they're hoping to get like a resolution
00:11:39 at some point. They want diplomatic talks. In fact, I think they just elected a president
00:11:43 who ran on a platform of like reform, reforming relations with North Korea. I mean who knows
00:11:48 that has any chance of working. I'm certainly no expert in the politics. But like they want that
00:11:53 to happen but like they are just like yeah like it's too big to think about for them. The fact
00:11:57 that every single day they could be wiped off the face of the earth at the whim of King John Moon.
00:12:01 Yeah, sure. This isn't the world politics, PCP. This is the military. It's related but yeah you're
00:12:07 right. I kind of wish it was. Let's talk about PCP. This is the fashion. This is fashion piece.
00:12:12 Yeah, yeah. Fashion Seoul. I guess. I guess. Dude. Dude. We're not in a fashion so cluster punk dude.
00:12:19 What is? Military fashion is so fucking cluster punk. What are you talking about? It's not cluster
00:12:24 punk at all. It's the most streamlined like disciplined organized possible fucking thing.
00:12:29 It could be. That's what we have to all achieve too. When the dark carnival starts. The jugglers
00:12:35 assemble their armed forces. Now that will be a cluster punk military. No, no. People will be too
00:12:41 scared to call it world war three so they'll just call it the dark carnival. They will be too horrified
00:12:47 to call it world war three. So yeah, we're in the midst of a dark carnival ladies and gentlemen.
00:12:53 All it would take is for Donald Trump to say I am now a juggler. I'm down with the clown.
00:13:03 And American brothers and sisters. And like everything will come true that was in Homestuck
00:13:07 just like we all thought. Just like we all knew. It will all come true. Guy Fieri will be there,
00:13:12 you know. Trump says I'm Dan and Clown ladies and gentlemen. He says as a nuke explodes behind him.
00:13:20 Like he puts on the shades like cool like walking away from explosions.
00:13:24 As he nukes his, cause he fucking nukes the White House, his own fucking house. He's just like
00:13:30 fuck this shit man. This is the carnival baby. And it gets replaced with a black and white house.
00:13:39 What a fucking North Korea just explodes itself. That point in life.
00:13:46 Well, you know, that sounds pretty cool. Unfortunately, like, you know, to the rest
00:13:50 of the world, excuse me, like the North Korean people are also like brainwashed people being
00:13:55 held hostage. You know, who knows, I don't know what they, if they actually like believe this
00:13:59 shit. I mean, I'm sure to some level they do cause the propaganda has been so intense.
00:14:02 I got an angle. I got an angle for this. For about the military. Your favorite historical army
00:14:10 thing. Like from age of empires or civilization. Fucking whatever you know. What is your favorite?
00:14:18 I like, I don't know. You go first, give, let me think while you say something.
00:14:24 Well, I played age of empires too a lot and, uh, fucking love that game. Learned so much more
00:14:31 about history from that game than I ever did in my books. That's what video games are. Video games
00:14:37 are teaching makers. They're like books only good. They're like books, but you don't have to open them.
00:14:42 You have to click on them though. Double click. But you have to install Linux and then boot your,
00:14:48 you know, Windows andulator. You have to fucking draw your own game. And then you have to draw every
00:14:53 frame. Yeah, exactly. Every frame literally a gimp painting is the way it's said.
00:14:59 Every frame of PNG.
00:15:04 But, uh, fucking, I loved, uh, in that the English longbowmen, mostly because I'm English and that's
00:15:10 like, oh yeah, I want to be an archer now. I want to be a longbowman. But because also that if you
00:15:15 get like 50 of them, uh, they can just completely decimate like anybody because they've got the
00:15:21 longest range. And it's so cool to see all those arrows flying. God, I love, I love arrows, dude.
00:15:29 Um, um, you would also nice. I fucking love knights and castles. Okay, but
00:15:33 Knights are you would love Sif five because they have longbowmen. England has longbowmen
00:15:38 a longbowman in that game, and he's fucking overpowered because he can see so fucking far.
00:15:44 He can see like millions of miles at a time. He is he's
00:15:48 Fucking literal, literally elves were based on Longbowmen. I'm making that up, but it makes sense to me.
00:15:56 I mean, J.R.R. Tolkien was English, so pretend you were wrong.
00:16:02 Proven confirmed.
00:16:04 But did you know, here's a stupid gay fact. Did you know that it was required by law that every male has to learn to be an archer in England?
00:16:16 And that was a law that was never stopped. It's still in effect. It's just nobody fucking gives a shit.
00:16:22 That's pretty sick.
00:16:24 That's awesome.
00:16:26 There's these weird old laws in America that you have to carry a gun on your way to church on Sunday in New England.
00:16:34 Because there were Indian raids going on, so they wanted all the men to be armed and shit.
00:16:38 But still, in some towns, you are by law ordered to carry a gun with you to church wherever the fuck you go.
00:16:45 I don't see why that's a law. You just do that normally.
00:16:49 Yeah, I hear you, dude. Jesus wants to see us pack any heat.
00:16:53 I still killed the Native Americans on my way to church still. No one stopped me yet.
00:16:59 You didn't get the memo.
00:17:03 You know, okay, my favorite military, I think, I mean, I'm quite fond of the Nazis.
00:17:07 I'm quite fond of the Nazis as well.
00:17:09 You know it, bro.
00:17:11 They were pretty cool, but I'm definitely going to give it up to the Persian slave hordes.
00:17:15 The Persian slave hordes are totally dope and they're full of magic.
00:17:19 I'm basically basing this just on 300, but they're fucking sick, bro.
00:17:24 And they hurl themselves endlessly and they just die in agony and pain.
00:17:29 They don't want to be there, but they're forced to be there by their god king.
00:17:32 That's the army for me. That's what I want to know.
00:17:34 Any army that uses elephants is so good.
00:17:38 So cool. So what elephants are the coolest?
00:17:41 Big guy with a big nose swinging out around.
00:17:44 You could pick up a club. You could whack him with a club.
00:17:47 Like, yeah, that's exactly what I want to see on the battlefield.
00:17:50 The most powerful nose in the Middle East.
00:17:54 All right, Munch, what do you like?
00:17:57 Oh, I don't know about that. Israel's got a powerful mouth.
00:18:00 Yeah, that's true. I could really sniff out a deal if you know what I'm saying.
00:18:05 There's a lot. There's quite a bit, so I'm just going to rattle off some.
00:18:11 My all-time favorite war of all time is World War I.
00:18:15 My favorite period of time is the 1800s through 1900s.
00:18:20 Everything before is gay, besides the ones that aren't,
00:18:24 and then also everything afterwards is gay, except it's not. It's even better.
00:18:29 So yeah, World War I, I like Venezuela.
00:18:32 I like the South American Wars of Independence. All of them pretty cool.
00:18:36 I like pretty much anything in Europe.
00:18:39 Anything there is good, besides when it involves anything in East Europe,
00:18:42 because each Europe is gay.
00:18:45 And everything in the ages is gay.
00:18:48 Yeah, that's pretty much it.
00:18:50 So which military force is your favorite, though?
00:18:53 Oh, wait. Oh, that. Oh, shit.
00:18:57 I don't know. They're all pretty bad. I hate them.
00:19:00 I'm like, okay, really?
00:19:02 What about the fucking World Warriors from Scotland?
00:19:05 Oh, my God.
00:19:06 Oh, my God. The Dragon Queen.
00:19:08 Oh, wait, fucking the Romans. The Romans, they're the coolest.
00:19:13 They made a fucking turtle's things with their fucking shields.
00:19:17 They made turtles on the battlefield.
00:19:19 Wait, you mean the, fuck, the phalanx?
00:19:21 Because that was a Greek thing first, wasn't it?
00:19:23 No, no, the Roman, well, maybe it was, but the Romans developed...
00:19:26 It was in 300, bro.
00:19:28 Yeah, okay.
00:19:30 Whatever.
00:19:32 But the Romans, they invented, like, mass producing by means of, like,
00:19:38 making the equipment exactly the same by using molds and stuff
00:19:42 and making everything to order exactly the same
00:19:45 so that their shields could very easily lock together
00:19:49 to make, like, big old, like, you couldn't fucking get them.
00:19:53 They're just impenetrable.
00:19:55 That's the coolest.
00:19:56 That's true. That's the phalanx, right?
00:19:58 I don't know whether it's called a phalanx,
00:20:00 but if you type in Roman turtle thing, you'll find some shit.
00:20:04 Also, asterix and obelisk is my dad.
00:20:07 I just want that to be known.
00:20:09 Okay, what was that one?
00:20:11 It's my favorite thing.
00:20:13 Hippo, red pillion whales.
00:20:16 It's just England, right?
00:20:20 Alright, whales is the little bump on the left side of the UK, England.
00:20:26 Great, like, yeah.
00:20:28 I know that at one point, I think it may have been a country with a king,
00:20:35 but I'm not actually sure that it ever was
00:20:38 and I'm not sure that it ever was not part of England,
00:20:41 but they just speak a different language and they have a flag
00:20:43 and we're like, fine, just have it.
00:20:45 It rains all the time over there.
00:20:47 We don't care.
00:20:48 I know that, I mean, Scotland has referendums on independence sometimes
00:20:52 that I think, yeah, that didn't pass last time.
00:20:54 Does whales ever have, like, referendums for independence?
00:20:56 Is that a thing they do?
00:20:58 Yeah, well, that's the thing, because I've heard once,
00:21:02 and I don't know whether it's true, but it was probably true,
00:21:04 because it was on television,
00:21:06 that whales is not technically its own nation,
00:21:10 but it's treated, it has a border and you need your passport
00:21:13 and it's basically a nation,
00:21:15 but they don't really care about seceding
00:21:17 because they have no real infrastructure,
00:21:20 like their biggest exports are like Tom Jones
00:21:24 and stuff like that.
00:21:26 What is Tom Jones?
00:21:28 What's your pussycat?
00:21:30 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
00:21:32 Oh, I see.
00:21:34 That guy, oh my god, I'm clipping.
00:21:36 He's from Wales? Is that like an American?
00:21:38 No, no, there's a lot of Welsh singers
00:21:41 that are very, very good at singing.
00:21:43 For some reason, I think it might be the language.
00:21:45 They're just good at singers.
00:21:47 They're good at singers. They make good singers
00:21:49 and that's what they export. That's my point.
00:21:51 I'm clipping the mic and I've got to change the mic.
00:21:54 Well, let's, okay, let's talk about,
00:21:56 let's completely shift gears back to military stuff,
00:21:59 and let's talk about the current American military
00:22:02 and what we think about, because that's the thing
00:22:04 that we have the most, oh wait, I forgot, you're from England,
00:22:06 but nonetheless, you can talk about the British military
00:22:08 to care too, but like, I mean,
00:22:10 some of the guys that we were hoping to have on here
00:22:12 actually grew up near fucking military bases
00:22:15 and know a lot of people in the military.
00:22:17 Oh, did you? I didn't know that you were,
00:22:19 they're that near one. Okay, what do you think?
00:22:21 What do you think of our fine men and women in uniform?
00:22:23 Here is my opinion of people in the military.
00:22:26 Every single day, there is a helicopter
00:22:30 or a plane that runs over my head very fucking fast
00:22:34 and he always scares me because he just thinks
00:22:37 this is the day. This is the day where I get 9-11.
00:22:40 It's about to happen, but now it's finally transpired
00:22:44 and I am about to become the 9-11.
00:22:47 But it never happens and I'm getting increasingly upset.
00:22:50 Like, if you're gonna do that to me,
00:22:52 why not just fucking pull the trigger, you know?
00:22:54 You're upset that they're just delaying the inevitable.
00:22:56 Right, right. And soon those will be drones instead.
00:22:59 Oh no, 9-11 drones.
00:23:03 Yeah.
00:23:05 That will truly be 7-11.
00:23:07 I live next to like a huge military base
00:23:10 and there's like a town that's developed around the military base
00:23:13 and all of them are just rich assholes.
00:23:15 And so, I don't know, they're pretty gay.
00:23:18 Actually, no, I went to a bowling alley one day on the base
00:23:21 with a military friend and I like bowling.
00:23:24 So there, you know what, they're good.
00:23:26 I've changed my opinion. They're actually really nice people.
00:23:29 On the basis of they like bowling too.
00:23:33 Yeah.
00:23:35 I don't really know a lot of people in the military
00:23:37 but I have found everybody to be very, they're very professional,
00:23:40 they're very polite.
00:23:42 These guys seem like they know what's going on with the shit around them.
00:23:45 So, I don't know, I like them.
00:23:47 I guess I just, this isn't even really a criticism of the military
00:23:50 but I don't like people with guns near me at all.
00:23:54 I don't like when people could kill me if they want to
00:23:57 because I don't know these people
00:23:59 and I don't know if they're actually sane or crazy.
00:24:02 It always spooks me when I see like, when I'm in like the airport
00:24:05 or just like a, I don't know, like in Penn Station
00:24:07 a couple times I've seen like people with guns walk around
00:24:09 and like military people.
00:24:11 Yeah, it's a little spooky, it's a little spooky.
00:24:13 I just don't trust anyone in the world
00:24:16 including like the military or the politicians
00:24:19 or my friends or family.
00:24:21 I don't trust anyone. I'm on my own. I'm on my own.
00:24:24 And when there's people with guns, yeah, they scare me a little bit.
00:24:28 They scare me a little bit, including cops.
00:24:30 I don't think you hate freedom of speech.
00:24:32 I mean the Second Amendment.
00:24:34 Whatever, you hate guns?
00:24:36 Oh my fucking god.
00:24:38 Thank you for condensing my argument to the important part here.
00:24:40 Jesus Christ.
00:24:42 You know, I don't know how true this is
00:24:47 but I've always felt like, maybe it's just my own propaganda
00:24:50 on my side of the pond.
00:24:53 But the general feeling I get is that the American military is big
00:24:58 but it's not like tightly constructed.
00:25:01 Like they have bunches of soldiers and bunches of stuff
00:25:04 but there's a larger percentage of them that are just not that well-trained
00:25:09 and they fuck up and do bad stuff and kill one guy.
00:25:12 Now hang on, hang on a second there.
00:25:14 I don't know if that's at all true.
00:25:16 Huh?
00:25:17 Because like, I mean, how many military people do you and I really know?
00:25:22 I have no idea what's the process of military training
00:25:25 but I feel the need to feel better than you guys
00:25:29 because my military is smaller.
00:25:31 Oh, you would get to Paris and I see.
00:25:33 Yeah, yeah, it's smaller because obviously there's less people
00:25:36 but because of the smallness and the fact that we're an island
00:25:40 we have like a big old naval thing, we've always had that
00:25:43 and we've got a good air force
00:25:45 and we're like more tightly woven.
00:25:48 We're like a scare force.
00:25:50 Hey, I'm scared now.
00:25:53 Like, you know, put together very, very carefully and properly and trained
00:25:58 and like you gotta do it right otherwise you're gonna get slapped.
00:26:02 Do your bootlace.
00:26:03 What softener?
00:26:04 You can't drink the tea while you fly the plane.
00:26:07 I know nothing about fucking military, why am I here?
00:26:11 Well, here's why.
00:26:13 I want to join the military
00:26:18 and I want to drive a tank
00:26:21 and I want to shoot a head.
00:26:23 Consider this your official signing into the military.
00:26:28 I'm leaving the PCP, I'm joining the military.
00:26:31 That's what I'm gonna do.
00:26:33 They do bigger podcasts there.
00:26:35 They get more money per podcast.
00:26:37 They do podcasts while doing drone strikes.
00:26:39 That's what they're about.
00:26:40 It's an upgrade in a big way.
00:26:42 Those podcasts are way better because they have like live feeds
00:26:44 of the people they're bombing.
00:26:46 It's so cool.
00:26:47 It's part of the drone.
00:26:49 It's very engaging.
00:26:50 It's basically like soldiers react to carnage
00:26:54 that they're causing.
00:26:56 Let me say this.
00:26:58 I want to do that.
00:27:00 You should.
00:27:01 I think about, I have a lot of respect for military people
00:27:04 because I think that a lot of them do all their shit for the right reasons
00:27:08 and that they, I mean I'm too cowardly to want to do this shit
00:27:12 but they really are willing to put their lives on the line
00:27:15 and risk it for stuff.
00:27:16 I guess I didn't really say about the people who joined the military.
00:27:21 I think it's generally a silly idea
00:27:26 but I see why people do it.
00:27:29 It's like part, you want to be like a hero.
00:27:33 You want to be protecting people.
00:27:35 You do it for a good reason, hopefully.
00:27:38 You don't just want to shoot people.
00:27:40 You want to protect your country.
00:27:41 You feel proud and all that and this stuff.
00:27:44 But I feel like it's generally, it's pretty silly
00:27:48 because the government may have like a stupid idea
00:27:51 that they want to send you to the wrong place and kill the wrong people.
00:27:54 You have to trust your government really
00:27:56 or whoever's commanding you if you're in the military.
00:27:58 It's just like, I don't know.
00:28:00 I wouldn't join the military because I don't trust
00:28:03 really any government to put me in the place
00:28:06 that's going to do the best for the world at large.
00:28:10 I would care about my country more just in general
00:28:14 because that's where all my friends and family are
00:28:17 and where I am, I don't know.
00:28:19 It's a very big thing.
00:28:21 I say that not joining the military is like pirating video games.
00:28:27 It's like that.
00:28:28 Because you are reaping the benefit of like
00:28:32 labor that other people are doing, people in the military.
00:28:35 I mean obviously the degree is different.
00:28:37 You are profiting from like other people's work.
00:28:40 And yes of course we all pay taxes and shit
00:28:42 and if you're in the military you get paid
00:28:44 and good things come to you if you do so.
00:28:47 But you're taking an extreme risk doing that kind of shit.
00:28:51 You're putting yourself at the very least in harm's way
00:28:54 even if it's not extreme risk.
00:28:55 You could have like a desk job or whatever.
00:28:56 But you're part of this machine that's doing defense.
00:28:59 And you know what, I mean that's kind of silly.
00:29:01 I thought somebody would yell at me and I would concede
00:29:03 that it's not actually like pirating video games.
00:29:06 I was going to totally agree with you as a joke
00:29:09 because it sounds so funny.
00:29:11 Like a one-to-one correlation is exactly the same.
00:29:14 That's good.
00:29:15 But like, okay, I got a lot of respect for these people.
00:29:18 I always think about that scene.
00:29:19 I watch this movie all the fucking time.
00:29:21 A few good men with Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson.
00:29:24 And that part at the end, like the most famous scene of the day,
00:29:26 you can't handle the truth where Jack Nixon's like,
00:29:29 son we have a country that has walls
00:29:31 and those walls need men to stand on them
00:29:34 and defend the nation for people who want to destroy it.
00:29:36 Who's going to do it, Lieutenant Weinberg?
00:29:38 You? You?
00:29:40 I forget the names of the other characters.
00:29:42 But yeah, like the point is like that guy gets it.
00:29:44 That guy realizes that like there, no matter what,
00:29:48 there's always going to be forces
00:29:50 that like want to take things that other people have.
00:29:53 And I'm not saying, like in their case,
00:29:55 they're talking about like Cuba.
00:29:56 And at the time like Cuba and America were very much not,
00:29:59 not liking each other so much.
00:30:01 You know, things are different now,
00:30:03 but there's always going to be something like that.
00:30:05 And I just really appreciate the people who do do that shit.
00:30:08 Yeah.
00:30:09 And like I've got a personal memory of this.
00:30:12 Like when I was a kid, I worked at Papa Gino's,
00:30:14 this pizza shop in Massachusetts.
00:30:16 Nothing beats it.
00:30:17 And like there was this, yeah, it's the best.
00:30:19 It's my favorite.
00:30:20 And there was this guy who worked there for a little while.
00:30:23 And he was a veteran,
00:30:24 but he was only a couple years older than me.
00:30:26 I was like 17 or something.
00:30:28 He was like 21, 22, like really young,
00:30:30 but he was an Iraqi fucking veteran already
00:30:33 and had like come back.
00:30:34 And like he told me the story one time
00:30:36 about how like, yeah, you know,
00:30:38 one time me and my buddies were like raiding this house
00:30:40 and you know, there was a fucking,
00:30:42 there was a perp there or whatever the word was.
00:30:44 Like there was a fucking guy there trying to kill me.
00:30:46 And so like I, you know, I,
00:30:48 something happened.
00:30:49 I like fell back.
00:30:50 I pop off a few rounds and I see this guy looking down to me
00:30:53 and I'm like, yeah, right.
00:30:54 I'm about to die for my country.
00:30:55 You know, I'm doing what I can.
00:30:56 I'm trying to just trying to, you know, be a good person.
00:30:59 And, but he didn't dial, he didn't get shot.
00:31:01 He survived that particular situation.
00:31:03 But now here he was just like barely scraping minimum wage
00:31:07 in this fucking pizza shop, despite being like that level
00:31:10 of willing to put himself in danger for like my sake
00:31:13 and everybody else.
00:31:14 And like the world just didn't give a shit about this guy.
00:31:17 And like, I get it, you know, capitalism,
00:31:19 you are the value that you can give to the world.
00:31:21 But like, God damn, I just felt like the world
00:31:24 wasn't respecting this guy enough and other people like him.
00:31:27 That's why I said it was silly because of the way veterans
00:31:30 are treated.
00:31:31 Not, not because I don't respect them because like,
00:31:34 they're like the jobs they do, they do very well
00:31:37 and they have to do very well.
00:31:38 Otherwise they're dead.
00:31:39 So it's like, it's very respectful and it's very like,
00:31:42 you know, that's why I said I like war.
00:31:44 Like it's very romantic.
00:31:45 It's very cool.
00:31:46 Young boys all over the world.
00:31:48 They just, they just dream of being a tough soldier
00:31:51 and defending their country and stuff.
00:31:53 When Gibb hears about a bunch of young boys in one place,
00:31:55 he knows that's the place he wants to be.
00:31:57 Yeah, school.
00:31:59 School, kindergarten, yes.
00:32:02 But like, yeah, it's like, they're just,
00:32:05 they come home and then they're fucked.
00:32:07 Like if they had, especially if they got a leg blown off
00:32:10 or whatever, they get a nice award, you know,
00:32:13 like a little dinner for you.
00:32:16 Fucking, it's just, it's just a really bad thing
00:32:19 to have to go through and then you're not even
00:32:22 in a position of power.
00:32:24 You're just, you're just a grunt.
00:32:26 You're just a throwaway object of a human being
00:32:28 to the government that you signed up to serve.
00:32:31 And it's just, that's why I think it's silly.
00:32:34 Like it's just, that's why we need robots to take over
00:32:38 the jobs of the military.
00:32:40 Not because, not because of like, you know,
00:32:44 well actually yes, because it's better.
00:32:46 Because, because robots, they can't feel
00:32:49 and they don't deserve rights.
00:32:51 And fuck them, I hate robots.
00:32:53 True, true.
00:32:55 We just need Mecca and then we can just fight
00:32:58 with our Mecca and not have foot soldiers.
00:33:01 Anything we can do to lower the total number
00:33:03 of people who die in war would be a good thing, I think.
00:33:05 Drones, dude, Obama tech.
00:33:08 That's true, only drones kill 90% not the targets, you know,
00:33:13 they just kill like other people.
00:33:15 Obama invented Obamacare and also Obama tech.
00:33:20 Obama's scare.
00:33:22 Obama's scare, there we go.
00:33:24 What is it with you, it's scary today.
00:33:27 I don't know, this is the Halloween episode.
00:33:29 I don't know.
00:33:30 That's what these drones are called.
00:33:31 He invented drones, he invented Obamacare.
00:33:33 That's what it's called.
00:33:34 Yes, that's right.
00:33:36 Okay, okay, okay, I have to interject here.
00:33:38 Just catch up just like a few sentences before I continue
00:33:42 what we were actually talking about.
00:33:44 Back up, I realized that my favorite military force
00:33:48 was actually the British.
00:33:50 And I like the ship of the lines,
00:33:53 I like how they go around and they fucking destroy people
00:33:56 and minorities, and I liked how they subgrade people.
00:34:00 And I wish that it lasted longer.
00:34:02 Oh, good things, all good things.
00:34:04 Pretty good.
00:34:05 What time period?
00:34:06 Yeah, what time period, like when they were the big empire.
00:34:08 Oh, time period, like late, like second half 1800s
00:34:13 until they got fucking their ass kicked.
00:34:15 After the Yanks broke away?
00:34:17 Like around the time when India was in full swing.
00:34:20 Oh, right, okay, sure, sure.
00:34:22 I really love the whole red coat sort of uniform.
00:34:26 Yeah.
00:34:27 The funny hat.
00:34:28 Yeah, man.
00:34:29 You know, George Washington wanted to be a red coat
00:34:31 his whole life and he never fucking made it.
00:34:33 Instead, he just became president to the United States.
00:34:36 Gay.
00:34:37 Yeah, that's the national anthem.
00:34:41 Yeah, it's a sick power metal album.
00:34:47 It was from George at least.
00:34:49 I like England, France, and Germany.
00:34:52 I like all the western Europeans besides Spain.
00:34:56 If you follow me on Twitter, you know my notorious eight for Spain.
00:34:59 If you listen to this in Spain, I fucking hate you.
00:35:02 Get fucked moved to Portugal or France.
00:35:05 I'm gonna blacklist all of you.
00:35:07 All of you are blacklisted from listening to this.
00:35:09 Hey, weren't you calling for Portugal to be absorbed by France
00:35:12 just so that the peninsula would look better?
00:35:14 Yeah, I did that before I was red-pilled on Spain.
00:35:17 Before I was fucking red-pilled on.
00:35:19 Yeah, Portugal should absorb Spain.
00:35:21 Yeah, the opposite.
00:35:23 Anyway, so I like all that culture.
00:35:25 Anyway, back to what we were fucking saying.
00:35:28 Right.
00:35:29 Why would I, like on military, like joining the military
00:35:33 and like, you know, people with vets and stuff.
00:35:35 Sure.
00:35:36 Why would I fight for beliefs and reasons I don't believe
00:35:39 or I think fully understand because the government's always like doing like
00:35:42 weird puppet shit and they're never gonna actually tell me
00:35:44 what I'm actually fighting for.
00:35:46 I don't have like a national identity or anything whatsoever.
00:35:49 And even if I did, I'd better things do than like die for a cause
00:35:51 that I don't have a stake in.
00:35:53 And like I respect, you know, veterans for doing this stuff.
00:35:55 But I do not, I do not feel like I am American.
00:35:58 And I know that's like not, I think that's like a problem probably.
00:36:02 But I don't feel like I'm an American.
00:36:03 You're fucking globalist?
00:36:04 Is that what you're telling me right now, Munchie?
00:36:06 I am literally a globalist.
00:36:07 Close Photoshop and end yourself right now.
00:36:09 I am literally Photoshop.
00:36:11 Yeah.
00:36:12 Yeah.
00:36:13 I like...
00:36:14 I understand the sentiment though.
00:36:15 That's kind of like a millennial sentiment to feel more like a,
00:36:17 like maybe a human or a world citizen as opposed to a national identity.
00:36:20 It's basically the internet, you know.
00:36:22 Yeah, that's right.
00:36:23 You're able for the first time to really talk to people from other countries, you know.
00:36:28 It's usually just the English speaking countries.
00:36:30 But sometimes there's, you know, other people from Europe who speak English
00:36:35 like Danes and stuff.
00:36:37 They say, hello, I'm from Daneland.
00:36:40 I say fuck off.
00:36:41 It's me.
00:36:42 You say fuck off.
00:36:43 Yeah, but like it used to be like that, like earlier, when it's like your nationality
00:36:49 in a YouTube comment section would mean something and people would laugh at you.
00:36:52 I mean, I guess they'd still do if you're on a video about like nations.
00:36:56 Sure.
00:36:57 But it matters so much less now because people have friends across countries so often.
00:37:03 So normal.
00:37:04 Where the military is concerned there, it kind of reminds me of Metal Gear Solid 4.
00:37:08 It's been like a bunch of years since Metal Gear Solid 2 happened and like the world has
00:37:12 changed such that like national identity has been like completely removed from like
00:37:16 militaries.
00:37:17 Militaries are now just like these hired groups that just, you know, they go wherever and
00:37:21 they just kill anyone and like ideology or like national borders no longer have anything
00:37:25 to do with like the wars that are fighting.
00:37:27 It's just like economics and, and I don't know, just petty squabbles or something.
00:37:32 I don't know.
00:37:33 I feel like the best way to solve most major conflicts is for like a, an actual good Google
00:37:43 translate to translate everything from every country so that everybody could talk to everybody.
00:37:47 There is some issues though, like cultural, like the fact that I'm just, I'm not gonna
00:37:52 say anime, but like-
00:37:53 AI that would figure out, like know the language and then know the thing and then maybe-
00:37:57 But, but I'm just saying some people, like just as one example, there's some, you know,
00:38:01 like Islamic people who want the whole world to live under Sharia law and that doesn't translate
00:38:06 very, like even if you understand what they want, that's not like helpful for when they,
00:38:11 you know, want to conquer your country.
00:38:13 Yeah, what I mean, what I mean is like you have like, you know, let's say video games,
00:38:19 like video games shipped to all sorts of countries.
00:38:23 If you have people from those games talking to each other from different countries and
00:38:27 they're just kids-
00:38:28 Will that solve all our problems?
00:38:30 Yeah, video games will save the world.
00:38:32 What I mean is like, you make friends as kids when you're naive and you don't know about
00:38:37 like world political stuff and Sharia law and like, oh well, I didn't know that, you know,
00:38:43 if you're like, if you're in the Middle East and you're a kid and you're online and you
00:38:49 hit, you know, your friends with all these American people and then your dad says, Americans
00:38:53 are fucking horrible and they suck.
00:38:56 Like some of those kids are going to be like, well, wait, I like these guys.
00:39:00 They're fun.
00:39:01 They're cool.
00:39:02 I don't, I don't know.
00:39:03 And then it's sort of, it's sort of makes the next generation a bit less prone to hating
00:39:09 people instantly.
00:39:10 I think that's definitely happening right now to some degree.
00:39:13 Definitely.
00:39:14 It's just, you know, the technology hasn't fully penetrated.
00:39:16 There's not enough Dota going on in like, I don't know, Iran right now.
00:39:20 We need to up our Dota levels a little bit so we can make this happen.
00:39:24 Dude, dude, okay.
00:39:25 E-sports will save the world.
00:39:26 E-sports will save us all.
00:39:28 Yes.
00:39:29 Okay.
00:39:30 Okay.
00:39:31 Okay.
00:39:32 Okay.
00:39:33 Okay.
00:39:34 Japan.
00:39:35 Oh my God.
00:39:36 Seoul.
00:39:37 Fucking Iran, bro.
00:39:38 Iran.
00:39:39 Dude.
00:39:40 Top E-sports exporter.
00:39:41 Exports, all of the E-sports, every single one is from Iran now in the future coming up
00:39:43 2020.
00:39:44 Are you, I was looking into this.
00:39:45 I had no idea.
00:39:46 I'm going to sound like a fucking idiot to people who like know politics well, but you
00:39:48 guys know that Iran like wasn't even like a very conservative place, you know, respectively
00:39:53 until like the current administration took over like 40 years ago and like the 70s or
00:39:57 something.
00:39:58 Like women didn't have to like wear veils and shit all the time, but now they do because
00:40:01 like there's like just the people in charge now change the country that way, which gives
00:40:04 me hope that it'll change, you know, to be more liberal in the future as well.
00:40:08 Yeah.
00:40:09 That'd be good.
00:40:10 That'd be good.
00:40:11 I don't know anything about the Middle East other than that there's oil and also people.
00:40:16 I know a lot about medieval Middle East, but not about a current shit.
00:40:20 By the way, hippo.
00:40:21 Well, that's fine.
00:40:22 I just want to know if you also believe this because it could seem like I agree with you.
00:40:26 Do you also agree that like 90% of positive change in the world currently could just come
00:40:32 from us just like just waiting for people to die?
00:40:37 Just like waiting for that.
00:40:38 I've had that thought like it's I've had that thought, but I feel like the amount of time
00:40:43 it would need because like people are still being indoctrinated to the old world values
00:40:48 by you know, family members and stuff.
00:40:51 It's not like people are all, you know, growing up being better or different or not.
00:40:57 But very much less so, I think, than previous incarnations of the world.
00:41:01 Less so, yeah.
00:41:02 Munchie, where that's concerned, it is always necessary that older generations die for certain
00:41:09 ideas to catch on.
00:41:11 For example, like the like our parents are probably less comfortable with like the amount
00:41:17 of time we spend interfacing with computers and like this kind of stuff.
00:41:20 So like to them, it's like a little weird and especially like two or three generations
00:41:23 before them.
00:41:24 They find it very strange that all this interpersonal communications going on and you know, maybe
00:41:28 it's bad for humans in some way, but like it's just the way that that culture is going.
00:41:32 It's inevitable.
00:41:34 So like that transformation is happening and like we're the generation that's comfortable
00:41:37 with that.
00:41:38 However, as technology evolves, as we're getting older, we're getting into our 20s, 30s, 40s,
00:41:42 50s, etc.
00:41:43 Like things like like VR that like plug us into virtual worlds, like it is a distinct
00:41:49 possibility that guys like us will all, we're all already too old to like really understand
00:41:56 that shit from birth and like we will be the old conjures who are like, oh, I don't understand
00:42:00 this.
00:42:01 Like this is weird.
00:42:02 And so already like things are being developed that we are not prepared for and that we will
00:42:06 need to die in order for like the society as a whole to absorb it and like process it
00:42:11 and be able to, you know, use it as effectively as it can be.
00:42:14 So that's absolutely a pot like not every human is not able to just change everything
00:42:19 about what they believe.
00:42:20 Sometimes you just got to die for the culture to evolve.
00:42:23 That's just a technology, though.
00:42:25 Is there an example you can think of like an ideology like that?
00:42:29 Absolutely.
00:42:30 Religion is, I mean, is a huge one.
00:42:31 Yeah, that's exactly what I was about to say, Nate.
00:42:34 Most millennials aren't fucking religious.
00:42:37 None of my friends know even who a God is.
00:42:40 Yeah.
00:42:41 They haven't ever even seen one.
00:42:43 When I see a millennial talking about God, I execute that millennial because they're
00:42:48 corrupting.
00:42:49 You know, this is just what I do every day.
00:42:50 I take those motherfuckers out windmill style, you know, bro?
00:42:55 Swing my arm around very fast.
00:42:58 That's windmill style.
00:42:59 Very fast.
00:43:00 Very fucking fast.
00:43:01 Yeah.
00:43:02 You don't even know, dude.
00:43:04 Yeah.
00:43:05 Also, just like everyone in the government is soon, like they're all like 100 years old,
00:43:13 just like in a couple years they'll be dead and we'll be able to be free.
00:43:16 Our government is like the oldest it's ever been.
00:43:18 I mean, people live longer, but like the people in office, like, like, I was just listening
00:43:22 to this the other day.
00:43:23 I believe it's like Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and like whoever else, like these are like
00:43:27 the leaders or like the Democrats and like the Senate and the House or something.
00:43:30 They are all like over 70 and that's like, that's really, really fucking old.
00:43:37 That's still like 10, 20 years.
00:43:40 Like I feel like...
00:43:41 That's like the danger that they'll just stay there for another 10 years.
00:43:43 Like these people are not going to understand new ideas.
00:43:46 But the thing is...
00:43:47 There's a reason why young people push out old people, you know?
00:43:50 I know, but like I feel like the old people will try to cultivate younger people to take
00:43:56 their place and that's been going on forever and it will continue to go on.
00:44:00 I'm not saying things can't change.
00:44:01 I'm saying it's not just going to be as simple as, oh, once they're dead, there's no one
00:44:06 who wants to take their place who is also evil.
00:44:09 You're right about that, but like a generation doesn't last that long at its longest.
00:44:13 You know, maybe like 20 years.
00:44:14 So like it's true.
00:44:16 People like Nancy Pelosi, let's say that they groom, you know, to be like the new leader
00:44:19 of the Democrats and the Senate, someone like her, yeah, a pizza gate.
00:44:25 They bring in people that are like her, but just because they're younger and the culture
00:44:29 itself is changing, it's inevitable that little change is creeping just as this process goes
00:44:33 along.
00:44:34 And some of them are major.
00:44:35 Like the whole gay marriage question flipped over the course of like one year from like
00:44:40 outlawed to completely legal in everywhere in the United States.
00:44:45 Like it's like, I mean, that, you know, was building up for a long time, but sometimes
00:44:49 things like that can happen that quickly.
00:44:51 And it's just, you know, really the people can force their representatives to do what
00:44:55 they want when they just like make their voice heard about what they really fucking want people
00:44:59 to do.
00:45:00 Okay.
00:45:01 But we're totally off topic here.
00:45:02 And I did want to bring up one issue directly about the military that we haven't talked about.
00:45:06 So I for one was doing a lot of praising of like the men and women in the uniform.
00:45:12 But I did want to bring this up because I feel like a lot of people talk about this
00:45:15 when they're talking about the military, especially on the left.
00:45:17 So like, okay, so the military's job basically is to kill people who are doing bad things.
00:45:23 So let's talk about people who joined the military so that they have an excuse to kill
00:45:27 people.
00:45:28 Say with like the police force or, you know, like I'm actually bringing up as like, do
00:45:31 you think it's maybe good that we have that as an outlet for people who just really want
00:45:36 to fucking kill people?
00:45:38 And like we have two choices.
00:45:40 We can like institutionalize them and keep them away from society in some way, or we
00:45:44 can put them to work killing the people we don't want around.
00:45:48 And I'm not saying wars are justified, just like, you know, we shouldn't just kill people
00:45:51 who are bad.
00:45:52 But if we can find like, I'm just going to say, if you're an ISIS, you should die.
00:45:56 So I'm totally cool with you people all being sacrificial land to make our murderer population
00:46:01 happier.
00:46:02 That's what I'm saying.
00:46:03 Find like the general difference between UK and US armies that I've seen from various
00:46:08 documentaries and various, I don't know, it may be propaganda, I may be talking out
00:46:13 of my butthole, but stop getting trying to give me to join the British military give
00:46:17 guide.
00:46:18 Damn it.
00:46:19 It's it's just there's this feeling of like, if they want to kill people, why not put
00:46:23 them in, you know, with a gun?
00:46:26 Which I don't I don't like as an idea because you shouldn't enjoy killing.
00:46:31 And if you do, you're more you're more likely to, you know, you're more likely to be fucked
00:46:36 up in the head and make a bad decision and get someone else killed or like, you know,
00:46:43 the military has to be a tightly run ship.
00:46:45 You need to be, you know, all properly coordinated and communicating and doing your job as you're
00:46:52 told because if you don't, you know, whoever makes the plan, if that plan doesn't go right
00:46:56 because some, you know, asshole on the field is just decided, no, wait, I can get him.
00:47:01 I can get him.
00:47:02 Yeah.
00:47:03 Should and guns.
00:47:04 Yeah.
00:47:05 And then the whole operation is fucked and, you know, it leads to other deaths or casualties
00:47:11 or or losing ground or losing position.
00:47:14 It's like, I feel like people who are fucked up in the head enough to want to kill a lot
00:47:19 of people should just become hunters and shoot deer or something.
00:47:23 Yeah.
00:47:24 It's not really a place because in the military, I obviously discipline is the most important
00:47:29 discipline.
00:47:30 Yeah.
00:47:31 That's the word I couldn't think of the fucking whole time.
00:47:34 Discipline, I feel is the most important.
00:47:37 You can't you can't go you can't go to war and be like a like a guy with a club.
00:47:42 You got a gun.
00:47:43 You got to aim right.
00:47:44 Well, let me, you know, I just think some people in their nature have a killer instinct
00:47:48 and I guess like, and that's a good, like me, you know, I just kill, I kill millennials.
00:47:53 That's my thing.
00:47:54 I'm the millennium killer.
00:47:55 That's, that's me.
00:47:56 I am the Zodiac killer also.
00:47:58 I don't even know what I'm saying that like it's good that there's a place for people
00:48:02 to go if they want to kill people.
00:48:04 I don't know.
00:48:05 I guess that's what I'm saying.
00:48:06 It's better than not having that.
00:48:08 I just, I don't think everyone with a killer instinct is an evil person necessarily.
00:48:13 There are good ways you can channel that.
00:48:14 I guess that's my point.
00:48:16 I don't, I don't even know.
00:48:17 Yeah.
00:48:18 Well, that's the thing.
00:48:19 I don't think a good way to cause like you can give them like therapy that can make outlets
00:48:23 for them.
00:48:24 Maybe if they really like hitting things, they could be like a guy who, a junk guy.
00:48:30 He smashes junk, junk into cubes with his bare fists or maybe, maybe you could pick
00:48:37 up drumming and just go wham, wham, wham.
00:48:39 And he could be a better person through, you know, something other than getting a gun and
00:48:45 killing a human being.
00:48:46 Like I said, hunting, like, like that is a thing that people can do.
00:48:50 It's killing, but it's like regulated and shit.
00:48:53 Yeah.
00:48:54 I guess I hear what you're saying.
00:48:55 I guess I'm really just like approaching the idea of like, I feel like if we had a bunch
00:48:59 of hardcore lefties on the show, what they would bring up is like that they don't like
00:49:03 the military.
00:49:04 I hear this from people like Jimmy Dorr, they freak out about like people are in, people
00:49:10 are cops or in the military because they want to hurt and kill people and they like that
00:49:14 feeling of control that it gives them.
00:49:17 I don't know.
00:49:18 Like you think that's a serious thing?
00:49:20 You think that's like a big deal?
00:49:21 I think it's, I think it's, it's, it's a kind of an unavoidable problem because you're giving
00:49:27 people power and there's obviously going to be people that want to abuse it.
00:49:32 And you know, it's not much you can do about it, except like having stricter training and
00:49:37 making sure people who are prone to abusing power get weeded out early on or banned or
00:49:46 stuff.
00:49:47 I don't know.
00:49:48 I feel like if you give a police officer a gun way too early before you know whether
00:49:53 he's going to shoot some guy or if the same thing with the military, if you give a guy
00:49:58 a gun before you know that he's not going to just shoot some random kid because he's
00:50:03 brown, like I'm not, I'm not going to get into a race thing, but like, you know, some
00:50:08 guys just like killing and I think you should, you should do it properly.
00:50:17 Yeah.
00:50:18 I don't want to be, I don't, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a gay, I'm not gay guys, I'm not
00:50:23 lefty.
00:50:24 Oh, no, I'm gay.
00:50:25 Oh, it doesn't matter.
00:50:26 It's fine.
00:50:27 No, I hear what you're saying.
00:50:28 Oh, hey, let's, let's just, it's, it's the thing I feel like, like, I don't, I don't
00:50:33 want to be.
00:50:34 You don't like, yeah, I think I understand what you're feeling.
00:50:35 I don't want to be a world peace faggot because I know it can't happen.
00:50:39 People like war, people like fighting.
00:50:41 I like, you know, the fact that war is cool is, is the reason it's going to continue.
00:50:46 You don't have been thinking about recently.
00:50:48 I've just been thinking about how I tend to spend a lot of the time in the theoretical
00:50:51 realm when I'm talking about my weird utilitarianism and shit.
00:50:55 I think I'm going to try to incorporate more of like present day realities into the things
00:51:01 that I'm thinking about.
00:51:02 I'm just going to try.
00:51:03 I don't know if it's going to work out, but that, that's kind of why I wanted to talk
00:51:05 mostly about like the, the military right now because like, I guess ideally a military
00:51:10 would be like Starfleet and like those people are like full-time employees shut up, shut
00:51:14 up, shut up.
00:51:15 I'm just, I'm, I'm just saying, I'm just saying.
00:51:17 You said immediately going back to Star Trek.
00:51:19 Well, just to make a goddamn point about what I'm not going to talk about as much.
00:51:23 Oh fuck this.
00:51:24 All right, let's.
00:51:25 No, I get it.
00:51:26 I get it.
00:51:27 Okay.
00:51:28 Yeah, you understand.
00:51:29 Like what I like about them is like their military like has another job that they do
00:51:32 the full like all the time they are explorers, but then like when there's a conflict, you
00:51:36 know, that's when like they're called in to, you know, defend and shit.
00:51:39 Okay.
00:51:40 Let's talk about one more.
00:51:41 Let's talk about one more question.
00:51:43 Wait, what are you saying?
00:51:44 Hold on, hold on.
00:51:45 I just realized.
00:51:46 The military should be a Star Trek.
00:51:47 It should be all like Star Wars, Battlefront 2.
00:51:50 No.
00:51:51 Every single like, like they're just a bunch of stormtroopers on each side and then once
00:51:56 they get enough points, the one who can turn into Darth Vader and then lose the push.
00:52:01 Yeah.
00:52:02 Yeah.
00:52:03 Dude, it's so true.
00:52:05 That is what it is currently.
00:52:08 Now, right now, after I said that, Obama was like, oh my God, we should get this guy on
00:52:13 the phone.
00:52:14 You're a soldier.
00:52:15 You kill like 15 people.
00:52:16 You turn into Barack Obama.
00:52:18 Yes.
00:52:19 That's right.
00:52:20 You can do the whole smash.
00:52:21 You should get Jedi floors.
00:52:23 You go down.
00:52:24 You use your fucking Nobel Peace Prize, Nobel Phantasm and just decimate everyone with
00:52:29 love gay beams.
00:52:30 All right.
00:52:31 Yeah.
00:52:32 That's what happens.
00:52:33 Okay.
00:52:34 Let's talk about one more question about this issue.
00:52:35 Okay.
00:52:36 What do you got?
00:52:37 Here we go.
00:52:38 Topical alert.
00:52:39 Oh no.
00:52:40 We got the trans community ban from serving in the military.
00:52:44 Trump did it.
00:52:45 What do you think?
00:52:47 Verdict.
00:52:48 Well, from what I hear, the whole thing, from what I hear that the issue was that people,
00:52:56 trans people, they go into the military, some of them do, to get the free surgery to change
00:53:04 gender.
00:53:05 Otherwise it would cost a lot.
00:53:07 And I think that's the reason, but obviously people are taking it as like, Trump hates trans
00:53:11 people and he just for no reason decides to ban them from the military and they are
00:53:15 their soldiers too.
00:53:16 People may have constantly taken the worst possible reading of anything Trump does as
00:53:21 like what it must mean, but yeah.
00:53:23 So I guess if those things about people abusing the system are correct, then I feel like it's
00:53:32 probably like drastic to ban all trans people, I guess, if you're, if you have trans surgery.
00:53:37 Like if you're already post-op and you just want to serve, it's like, yeah.
00:53:41 Or you could ban like the usage of military funding for your surgery and stuff and it
00:53:48 could be very specific surgeries that you could have, like getting a new arm if you
00:53:52 lost it, like stuff like that, banning them, I don't know.
00:53:55 It's obviously, you know, a thing that's getting people riled up, but I don't see too much
00:54:00 of a problem with it, except for the fact that people are fucking pissed.
00:54:05 You know what's interesting about it to me?
00:54:06 I think it might actually be a distraction tactic because it's so random that Trump might
00:54:12 have just done it to make people forget all the other shit that's going on, like the Russian
00:54:17 investigation and shit.
00:54:18 He actually just did it because he thinks it would like make people talk about that
00:54:23 a lot and like he's willing to, you know, just whatever, take whatever heat comes from
00:54:28 that to just distract people from the other shit.
00:54:30 I don't know.
00:54:31 I don't know.
00:54:32 I'm not too, you know, Trump politic, literate, knowledgeable.
00:54:39 It's inevitable that comes up a little bit when we talk about this shit.
00:54:42 I think basically we're all going to agree, like banning them across the board, like what
00:54:46 is that?
00:54:47 Doesn't really seem like the right policy.
00:54:49 Like there's probably some awesome trans people who really want to be fucking warriors.
00:54:53 Chief Monk, this is Shovel Knight from Famous Video Shovel Knight.
00:54:58 Oh no.
00:54:59 My favorite military was Ruin.
00:55:01 Oh, fuck.
00:55:03 But like, yeah, the thing about the Trump thing is like it was a tweet that he sent
00:55:08 out that said that Trump was not allowed in the military.
00:55:11 Dude, the generals were like, whoa, whoa, you didn't talk to us about this first, dude.
00:55:15 You just tweeted it.
00:55:16 No, no, no, no, no.
00:55:17 Not that, not that.
00:55:18 But like the idea is that he tweeted it, but his actual policy like in writing might
00:55:23 be different and might be actually less extreme than what he said, which is maybe the case
00:55:29 a lot of the time.
00:55:31 Nobody cares to look it up.
00:55:33 If that's true, though, he should just shut his fucking fat face and just like deliver
00:55:37 it properly the first time and avoid the shit, unless the whole point of it is to distract
00:55:42 and enrage people.
00:55:44 Like maybe that's actually what he's, I don't fucking know.
00:55:46 Anyway, I don't even want to talk about Trump.
00:55:48 He's a fucking bummer.
00:55:49 Well, I have an actual other military topic, like side to side.
00:55:52 Oh lord, okay.
00:55:53 It's just like the idea.
00:55:56 Jesus Christ.
00:55:58 How dare you bring that into this sacred podcast?
00:56:01 Okay, God.
00:56:02 It's the idea of the spending of the budget.
00:56:05 Oh yeah, okay.
00:56:07 Military budgets, I think we can all agree are fucking ridiculous because of the facts.
00:56:12 They eat up such a massive amount of the budget.
00:56:14 It's ridiculous.
00:56:15 It's really just because of the way budgets work.
00:56:20 One year they say, okay, well, we need some more fighter jets, so we've developed this
00:56:25 new fighter jet.
00:56:26 We're going to build 100 of them and it's going to cost this many billion and we build
00:56:31 them and then the next year, well, in order to have that amount of funding for this year,
00:56:35 we need to spend that many billion again, otherwise we won't get it the next year and
00:56:41 we need that funding because we're used to it now and we don't want to not have it.
00:56:44 So they just make more shit that's never going to get used because they don't need
00:56:52 that many extra jets.
00:56:53 There's so much waste.
00:56:54 So much fucking waste.
00:56:55 Yeah.
00:56:56 I'm looking at it.
00:56:57 I just hate the way I hate the way budgets work.
00:56:59 Why do they work like that?
00:57:00 Every single thing that's wrong is because budgets work on that basis that if you don't
00:57:05 spend it, you don't get as much next time.
00:57:06 Oh, I like this.
00:57:07 You're talking about all the right things now.
00:57:09 Yeah.
00:57:10 Yes.
00:57:11 These are these are solvable problems.
00:57:12 Theoretically, that's what I want to talk about.
00:57:14 I'm I put up a pie chart of American discretionary spending for the entire government in 2015.
00:57:20 $1.11 trillion, so $1.11 trillion.
00:57:24 The military budget, 54% of all spending was the military $598.5 billion.
00:57:32 That's too much money.
00:57:34 That's too it's it's I mean, it's more than half.
00:57:36 It's more than half.
00:57:37 Fucking food and agriculture is 1% of the budget, transportation, 2%.
00:57:43 Social security, unemployment and labor is 3%.
00:57:46 And people are screaming about how social security is like killing the American budget.
00:57:51 Meanwhile, fucking military, 54% of the entire fucking budget science, all science, 3%.
00:58:00 3% of the fucking budget.
00:58:02 What is this?
00:58:03 What is this bullshit?
00:58:04 All right.
00:58:05 You know, this is not good.
00:58:07 This is not good.
00:58:08 Guys, we got to fix this shit.
00:58:09 I got to look up the UK budget things for that because I don't I've never really looked
00:58:14 it up.
00:58:15 It's probably less than America's because we're crazy.
00:58:16 We're crazy.
00:58:17 Well, like a percentage wise, it probably it might it might be around the same.
00:58:21 I mean, America.
00:58:22 Okay.
00:58:23 To be fair, America has unique responsibilities because like we are strategically placed with
00:58:27 our military like throughout the world in a like stabilizing fashion like that that
00:58:31 is true.
00:58:32 So like it makes sense that we would put more into it.
00:58:35 But like Jesus Christ, $598 billion.
00:58:40 And like, you know how much it would take to like make like state college free?
00:58:46 It'd be like it's like a couple billion or something and like everyone could go to college
00:58:51 for free.
00:58:52 That's like not even 1% of the budget.
00:58:54 Oh, it's fucking nuts.
00:58:57 And like they argue endlessly that there's no way to take money away from this.
00:59:01 You could just look at this and you know that's not true.
00:59:04 You know it's not true.
00:59:06 I want to know your opinion.
00:59:09 Do you what is your opinion on the U.S. being like an intervention, like just fucking like
00:59:17 like going around the globe and just kind of like intervening and shit?
00:59:20 What do you think about that?
00:59:21 Well, I don't like that we're being a bunch of fucking globalists probably using Photoshop
00:59:24 to make all our goddamn logos and shit.
00:59:25 So I'm not I'm not a big fan of that American flag made in Adobe.
00:59:30 Thank you.
00:59:31 Disgusting.
00:59:32 Fuck yourself.
00:59:33 Wait, I think that was your name.
00:59:38 I can't say that I like it, but like I get it.
00:59:42 Like America's got its shit together when it comes to just like, I don't know, like
00:59:48 building its economy.
00:59:49 I mean, this is getting less true over time as we go, but like for a while there, like
00:59:52 after World War II, America just had its shit together better than anyone else in the world
00:59:57 by far.
00:59:58 Yeah.
00:59:59 It was great.
01:00:00 It was really, really good at the time.
01:00:01 So, you know, those those legacies continue, but like things like us jumping out of the
01:00:05 fucking climate, the Paris climate agreement are like kind of fucking with our position
01:00:09 there.
01:00:10 Trump get your shit together.
01:00:11 Okay.
01:00:12 In terms of like being interventionist, like the the the super lefty position is to say
01:00:17 like, no, just like leave everybody alone, dude.
01:00:19 Like what are you doing going into these countries and like, I don't like the fucking, I don't
01:00:25 know anything about like world events really, but like there was some genocides that like
01:00:29 didn't we invade Libya or something under Hillary Clinton?
01:00:32 And like, why did we do that?
01:00:33 I don't know.
01:00:34 Under under President Hillary Clinton.
01:00:36 Yeah.
01:00:37 Yeah.
01:00:38 During her day back in like 2008 or whatever, or I don't know, like 2007 or something.
01:00:42 Yeah.
01:00:43 Like, okay.
01:00:44 That's that's not good.
01:00:45 No, that was under fucking Bush or whatever.
01:00:47 Sometime recently we invaded Libya or something like lots of people died.
01:00:49 I don't know why we did it.
01:00:52 I have no fucking awareness of these things.
01:00:53 Okay.
01:00:54 But like Iraq, right?
01:00:55 Okay.
01:00:56 Iraq's like the obvious one.
01:00:57 For literally no good reason in terms of like what we said we were doing it for, like there
01:01:02 was all this cover about like it's got something to do with weapons of mass destruction or
01:01:07 like Osama bin Laden's there.
01:01:08 Like it was, it was like two years after 9 11 and ultimately it was completely unrelated
01:01:13 and we were like fed all this bullshit and like, okay, I just recently looked into this
01:01:17 shit.
01:01:18 Fucking Dick Cheney, vice president under under fucking the, you know, George Bush W.
01:01:24 He was like, okay, this is going to again be super obvious to anyone who knows anything,
01:01:28 but I'm a baby boy.
01:01:29 I just learned that he worked for, I believe it was like he was like the CEO of Halliburton
01:01:33 or like a really high ranking guy at Halliburton, which is a defense contractor that was given
01:01:38 contracts to go fucking fight in the Iraq war.
01:01:41 Like, like, this is like the most obvious thing I've ever heard now that I'm aware
01:01:46 of the facts.
01:01:47 Like they just started a war so they could make money and then like take the oil and
01:01:51 shit.
01:01:52 They just obviously benefited the people who made the decision to engage so obviously,
01:01:57 I don't know how the fuck they got away with it or people didn't make this clear to me
01:02:01 sooner.
01:02:02 I blame everyone else for me not knowing this fact.
01:02:04 Um, uh, I, yeah, I might be, I don't know if 100% was Halliburton, but it was like something
01:02:08 like that.
01:02:09 Like that's fucked up, dude.
01:02:11 Like what the, okay, whatever, I'm not going to go into it anymore.
01:02:14 But that's not good.
01:02:15 Okay.
01:02:16 Things like that are not good.
01:02:17 The only time America should do any kind of interventions thing is like, if we're like
01:02:22 asked to give help to like a country that's, I don't know, like fighting against like an
01:02:25 internal terrorist organization or something like, okay, obviously that's like a thing
01:02:29 that makes sense.
01:02:30 If there's a civil war going on somewhere, like, like in fucking, uh, Syria right now,
01:02:35 like it's a mess and it's not clear which side is like better.
01:02:39 But like, I could see why we should like do something about that situation.
01:02:45 We shouldn't.
01:02:46 Okay.
01:02:47 Like I don't think it's America's responsibility to be world police or like manage the whole
01:02:49 fucking world.
01:02:51 But like, I mean, at the very least to be cynical about it, we could at least like protect
01:02:55 our investment in the world and like try to make sure the world around us doesn't fucking
01:02:59 fall apart and we can still continue to like do trade and, you know, be a healthy member
01:03:04 of the world economy and make sure that the people we trade with aren't like, first of
01:03:08 all, like are able to like actually have materials that we can trade with and get get us things
01:03:12 that we want and you know, utilize their population to make goods and services that we need.
01:03:17 But then also like we can, and then we can worry about like the humanitarian thing, like
01:03:20 okay, maybe we'll maybe let's trade with North Korea.
01:03:23 You know, maybe we shouldn't.
01:03:24 That guy like literally has gulags where he enslaves political opponents who like do
01:03:28 nothing against him.
01:03:30 Like that's not good.
01:03:31 Let's not do that.
01:03:32 We should try to do something about that guy.
01:03:34 Not as much as the fact that he's got nukes all this other shit.
01:03:36 I don't know.
01:03:37 You hear him saying like, if it's, if it's in our best interest, I mean, and it doesn't
01:03:41 hurt anyone.
01:03:42 I mean, yeah, sure, go for it.
01:03:43 If there's a civil war that you could help end in a productive way, then that sounds
01:03:48 good as long as it doesn't like, you know, cripple America because America is good.
01:03:53 America is valuable.
01:03:54 We shouldn't let this place just like crumble so that we can like help people who are not
01:04:00 as well off as America because America is one of the, America is like Apple or like Elon
01:04:06 Musk or one of these like tech giants that like because we're doing well, the whole
01:04:11 world is doing well or better.
01:04:13 And we can provide things to the entire world that improve life for everyone.
01:04:16 You know, fucking smartphones, just technology in general.
01:04:21 You know, there's things that we did bad as well, but, but rap music, exactly Afro American
01:04:26 culture that we is our number one export.
01:04:28 Got all of that.
01:04:29 The only thing export in fact, yeah, it's great.
01:04:34 That's just, yeah, like, I mean, that's why that's the thing with like countries like
01:04:38 Sweden that are literally cucking themselves out of their country just to like, they're
01:04:43 so sorry that they're white.
01:04:45 They're so sorry that they're fucking white and they just want to, they just want to give
01:04:48 up and hand their fucking country to like anyone who'll take it.
01:04:52 And right now that's a lot of middle eastern people and like, they're just making their
01:04:55 country shitty.
01:04:57 They're making it worse.
01:04:58 There's like rape gangs and I don't know, I don't know the full facts.
01:05:03 Okay.
01:05:04 I admit fully.
01:05:05 I don't know all the full facts, but like Sweden is like a number one place that
01:05:08 wants to cuck itself because it's, it's so liberal.
01:05:11 It feels bad about even doing well at all when there's people out there who are suffering
01:05:15 and they don't understand the way that like economics work, whereas like it's not like
01:05:19 if you're doing well, you're taking things from other people.
01:05:22 You're just, you're, you're making yourself better off and that, and then if you trade
01:05:26 with other people in a consensual way, you can help them too.
01:05:29 That's like the basis of economic growth, just in general and commerce.
01:05:33 They should just try selling IKEA furniture to the police.
01:05:36 Exactly.
01:05:37 That'll frustrate them.
01:05:39 You shouldn't, you shouldn't undermine, just to finish my point, you shouldn't undermine
01:05:43 your own ability to be productive or helpful.
01:05:46 And you know, maybe I'm exaggerating what that's like in Sweden, but you know, they've
01:05:49 got other issues.
01:05:50 Like they're, they're, they're a big welfare state that I hear, I don't know this for
01:05:54 sure.
01:05:55 I hear is crumbling there.
01:05:56 Um, like they're just taking out too much fun.
01:05:58 They can't afford it.
01:05:59 They're too socialist.
01:06:00 I don't know if that's true or not, but that's what I've been hearing and I'd be interested
01:06:02 to look into it more and hear what people have to say about it.
01:06:05 You can't take on everyone's burden all the time.
01:06:07 You got to look out for yourself.
01:06:09 Every man has a responsibility, every person has a responsibility to take care of their
01:06:13 own shit.
01:06:14 I agree.
01:06:15 And then once you've got that just in order, then you can worry about helping other people.
01:06:18 And America, you know, has had its shit together for a while.
01:06:21 You know, maybe it's getting a little shaky or whatever, but it'd be nice to help people
01:06:25 if we can do that without fucking ourselves.
01:06:27 It's just like in Minecraft, when, when you're building, when you're building, you know,
01:06:31 you go out into a server and you're like, well, these guys need help, but I need to
01:06:35 build my house first.
01:06:36 So I'm safe for the night.
01:06:37 So I'll do that first.
01:06:38 I'll, I'll, I'll worry about my shit and then I'll go help when I know that I have
01:06:42 a safe place.
01:06:43 Now I understand.
01:06:44 Now it makes sense.
01:06:45 I, I think I'm not totally, you know, uh, solidified in this, but I, I'm, I'm, I'm thinking
01:06:54 I'm toying with that.
01:06:55 Maybe we should, like, you know, I don't really like the intervention.
01:07:00 And I think that maybe sometimes it's better for the world if we just let them toil and
01:07:06 like not police and just let, you know, uh, the world change and like let people die and
01:07:12 like let, you know, because that is like, we always go to war.
01:07:17 Yeah.
01:07:18 What?
01:07:19 Oh, okay.
01:07:20 I'm just saying like that is exactly what Star Trek, this big Libcuck show, that is what
01:07:25 the prime directive is all about and they grapple with this issue all the time.
01:07:30 And it's about how like all the time when like the fucking, uh, you know, whatever the
01:07:34 westerners came to America, uh, and they fucking took it over, like they just fucked
01:07:38 those people over.
01:07:39 Like you can't just integrate yourself into a society that you are, or like the conquistadors
01:07:44 in South America.
01:07:45 Yeah.
01:07:46 They fucked that place up.
01:07:47 Uh, like you cannot just invade a place and expect them to like immediately accept
01:07:52 like the things you bring them.
01:07:54 You have to let people develop independently.
01:07:56 And if you, if you can get involved with them in like a small way, cause you know, we're
01:07:59 all on earth.
01:08:00 It's not like in Star Trek where you can just avoid a planet entirely.
01:08:03 You know, then you can, you know, slowly work to bring people, you know, into the fold where
01:08:06 you are.
01:08:07 But like, like even Star Trek, a big Libcuck show acknowledged like, yes, we absolutely
01:08:12 have to let some people die in order for this society to grow itself and us to not completely
01:08:18 fuck it up.
01:08:19 Yeah.
01:08:20 I really think the main thing that's, that's making like America and other western countries
01:08:25 great again in political stuff all over the world is that one, it's PR like he was showing
01:08:33 like, oh yes, we're such a great nation that will help other people because we're so powerful
01:08:38 and you shouldn't fuck with us cause we have the power to spend on, on helping other countries
01:08:43 fight their wars or whatever.
01:08:45 Uh huh.
01:08:46 Um, you know, there's that, there's the show of like, we're the best where you can do all
01:08:49 this cool shit.
01:08:51 But there's also like the idea that if you don't intervene in certain places, they may
01:08:58 be taken over by people who you really don't want to be in power.
01:09:02 Like let's just, you know, the general idea is like, oh, well, if we don't help the right
01:09:08 side of win this war that's going on over here, there may be another North Korea emerging
01:09:14 in the future and we don't want that.
01:09:16 We don't even want the possibility of that.
01:09:18 We want to make sure whoever wins the war is on our side and they like us.
01:09:22 Yeah.
01:09:23 Yeah, that's true.
01:09:24 In, in the, in the beginning, in the beginning of North and South Korea, South Korea was
01:09:29 eating shit.
01:09:30 North Korea was doing pretty fine and not, you know, great.
01:09:34 Okay.
01:09:35 Uh, but like it, so, so that's how they got the head start and now they're fucking insane.
01:09:39 I mean, you know, they're always insane.
01:09:40 They're always calm.
01:09:41 But be a good one.
01:09:42 I mean, they were doing fine for themselves economically speaking somewhat at least.
01:09:45 Is it just because they had such ties with China?
01:09:47 Yeah, yeah.
01:09:48 They were just relying on that.
01:09:49 You're right.
01:09:50 Okay.
01:09:51 Uh, and, and so that's why I find like, like having just another North Korea seems pretty
01:09:55 far-fetched me because, okay, just take the obvious example, Middle East, some fucking,
01:09:59 you know, Syria, I guess, Syria just becomes a fucking super al-Qaeda.
01:10:04 They're, they're, the export is now 9-11 since their primary export.
01:10:09 Okay, right.
01:10:10 Uh, I don't, that, that government just will not last like, like, they just will not last
01:10:15 that long because it's built upon, you know, crazy shit that has no, like it has no grace
01:10:20 period of like being a good quote unquote country.
01:10:24 It just starts out shit and it will be continued to be shit, probably be, you know, probably
01:10:28 be on the map for like, you know, 10 years or something, but it will eventually crumble.
01:10:32 And I'm always thinking about things in like, like decades span.
01:10:36 You know, you're absolutely right about that.
01:10:37 It's just like, like North Korea really wasn't that big a deal at first after the Korean
01:10:41 War and it was just that like, you know, we just left it alone.
01:10:44 Like we knew they were doing crazy shit over there, but we just left them alone because
01:10:47 like, you know, the China's got their fucking back.
01:10:49 What are we going to do?
01:10:50 They got that shit covered.
01:10:51 So like it's just over time, they just got crazier and crazier and like we, we still didn't
01:10:56 address the problem.
01:10:57 And now we're at a point where they're like really close to having like the ability to
01:11:01 launch nukes against like the western coast of the fucking United States and they can
01:11:04 already do it to South Korea if they fucking want to.
01:11:07 Um, let alone Japan.
01:11:09 Jesus.
01:11:10 Yeah.
01:11:11 Japan too is within their range, I think.
01:11:12 So like that's, that's not good.
01:11:13 It's not fucking good.
01:11:14 Yeah.
01:11:15 Um, also like, yeah, like the whole rise of, of, you know, Nazi Germany, like they started
01:11:21 taking over a few places, but because they just had a huge war, everyone was like, ah,
01:11:25 we shouldn't really get involved.
01:11:26 Hitler was on the cover of Time Magazine or Hitler was man of the year twice, as I recall,
01:11:32 once because he was the best guy ever and they loved him and second because he was the
01:11:35 worst guy ever and he didn't like him anymore.
01:11:37 And they loved him as well.
01:11:38 Yeah.
01:11:39 They thought it was he, they really liked his SS uniforms.
01:11:41 They're really.
01:11:43 Before, you know, we end.
01:11:45 We're going to questions after this, so no worry, but yeah, yeah, go on.
01:11:49 We got, I looked up the, the, the whole British budget spending on stuff.
01:11:54 Oh good, good.
01:11:55 Remarkably different.
01:11:56 Uh, the, the total spending is like £762 billion.
01:12:01 Mm-hmm.
01:12:02 Uh, defense budget is only £44 billion.
01:12:04 Wow, okay.
01:12:05 So like, um, educate.
01:12:06 So like, we're like more than ten times more.
01:12:08 Yeah.
01:12:09 Education is like double.
01:12:11 But we're ten times more than fucking pussy.
01:12:13 You little bitch.
01:12:14 You don't even invest in fucking, see that's, yeah, okay, sorry, go on.
01:12:18 Yeah, even fucking keep Hong Kong, what the fuck asshole.
01:12:21 Yeah, I know dude, embarrassing.
01:12:24 The healthcare is like £138 billion, so I can see why people are like, you know, fuck
01:12:30 that shit.
01:12:31 Yeah.
01:12:32 Cause it's, it's generally okay, but it's, it's pretty fucking expensive and it doesn't
01:12:38 work very well for a lot of people.
01:12:40 Like I understand, like a lot of liberals just like, they look at this graph and they
01:12:43 think to themselves like, Jesus Christ, like my life is fucked right now.
01:12:48 Like imagine if I had had like a free college education instead of like having to, you know,
01:12:53 do whatever I had to do and not have the student debt.
01:12:56 Like wouldn't that be great?
01:12:57 And they're just looking at this budget.
01:12:58 They're like looking at all these billions of dollars just being thrown away and they're
01:13:01 like, I just want me a piece of that.
01:13:02 I want me a fucking piece of that so I can like square my life away.
01:13:07 You know, and maybe it's, maybe it's a reasonable request.
01:13:09 Like if I just hadn't had to take out these student loans, I wouldn't have gone under
01:13:13 financially, blah, blah, blah.
01:13:14 But you know, the only thing is I don't really have a lot of sympathy for people who feel
01:13:19 that, unless they really are in a bad way.
01:13:21 And I know I was totally privileged in my life, but I just like, just take responsibility
01:13:26 for your shit.
01:13:27 Take responsibility for your own life, you got to find your way out.
01:13:29 This is the situation you're in everybody.
01:13:31 So just don't cry about it.
01:13:33 Don't bitch and moan and feel free to campaign for what you think are like fair laws.
01:13:37 If you want to make college free for everybody, like, hey, go for it, campaign all you want,
01:13:42 no problem.
01:13:43 But like accept the reality of the life that you have and make the best of it, however
01:13:46 you can.
01:13:47 Be financially solving people.
01:13:49 Live in a tiny ass apartment like me so that you can pay off your student loans faster
01:13:52 and then you'll be financially free.
01:13:54 That's what I'm doing.
01:13:55 That's what everybody should do.
01:13:56 You know, just, just get your shit together.
01:13:59 That's what I'm saying.
01:14:00 Just from my privileged position of a guy who had really, you know, I don't know, middle
01:14:04 income parents.
01:14:05 I did just fine, grew up in a great place, had no major problems whatsoever.
01:14:10 That's me.
01:14:11 That's me saying all these things about how you need to get your fucking shit together,
01:14:13 you lazy sex shit.
01:14:15 That's me.
01:14:16 Pull yourself up by your bootstraps and then you set your boot on fire.
01:14:20 Speaking of that, welfare is like 113 billion for last year, by the way, this is all last
01:14:27 year, 2016.
01:14:28 How much is ours?
01:14:29 I don't know.
01:14:30 I closed it.
01:14:31 Let me pull it up again.
01:14:32 Yeah, go on.
01:14:33 113.
01:14:34 There's only three things on this.
01:14:36 There's pensions, there's healthcare and there's welfare and those are all over 100
01:14:40 billion.
01:14:41 And defense is like, it looks so small, it's like 44 billion.
01:14:45 It's like a libertarian government, like I can barely even see the suspense building.
01:14:49 I don't see, okay, there's no welfare, but it must be under social security, unemployment
01:14:52 and labor.
01:14:53 That's a total of 3% 29.1 billion and this is in 2015.
01:14:58 There you go.
01:15:01 What was it for?
01:15:02 It was like 170 some million for you guys?
01:15:05 113 billion.
01:15:07 That is a lot more than we spent.
01:15:09 So, 10 pounds, not dollars, so that's a lot more.
01:15:12 Yeah, it's a lot more and proportionally it's a lot more, yeah, just a lot more.
01:15:17 What do you know?
01:15:18 It's fucking more different than I would have expected.
01:15:21 Our fucking military is just so, needs so much, such a fucking money thing, takes up
01:15:26 so much fucking money, okay, whatever.
01:15:27 Well, let's move on.
01:15:28 Okay, guys, we all set.
01:15:29 Rolling for con crimes.
01:15:30 Yeah.
01:15:31 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
01:15:37 whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
01:15:40 Wait.
01:15:41 I love the Ottomans' old big old hats.
01:15:45 Oh, they get their fucking sword.
01:15:48 Shwing!
01:15:49 And then they got their big old fucking hat.
01:15:51 And then they go that's what they say
01:15:55 Oh, and then they fucking kill those goddamn fucking
01:16:01 Austrians give give you need to see I just got a picture this hat
01:16:04 I'm trying to
01:16:06 I've got the picture at this fucking hat dude. You have to see this. No, you do have to see this
01:16:11 I know what they look at this
01:16:14 Yeah
01:16:17 I've ever seen that's not even a joke. It's ridiculous. Well, you know why they're so big why?
01:16:24 It's because that's where they keep their wives
01:16:29 That's how Islam you also that oh
01:16:33 By the way, also an actual thing fun fact back when World War one was like first starting
01:16:40 Like the like fashion-related the France like put on their fucking sick-ass like colorful uniforms
01:16:45 They're all like kind of hard-moving and also like colorful and then like they were just walking up to a fucking German
01:16:51 Like like before and then Germans could just easily spot them like on the fucking horizon
01:16:56 Just mow them down like one after another machine gun fire. So like they're uniform just made
01:17:03 Massacred all of them just fucking
01:17:07 obliterated
01:17:08 Is it is a time is an age gone by where where war was was like
01:17:13 Civilized and you're stood on one hill and with your flag and you saw the other guy and you went
01:17:19 And then you walked slowly towards them and since muskets such you had to get real close before you could fire
01:17:25 And then they just kept doing that and guns got better and then
01:17:29 Now everyone's hiding in bushes. You know when that changed that mostly changed during the American Revolution, baby
01:17:35 Thank You Native Americans for teaching us that shit. Oh, don't
01:17:39 What do you mean? No insane
01:17:41 That's when they they had to fucking fight with guerrilla tactics. That was like considered dishonorable at the time
01:17:45 So, you know like they didn't like it, but that's how we fucking what I well, okay?
01:17:49 I guess I didn't I didn't like that
01:17:52 They invented God damn it. We took we culturally appropriated it from the Native Americans
01:17:58 I would say the first modern war was like, okay
01:18:05 Either I would say like the seven years war. No, not this fucking seven years
01:18:10 I'm gonna say it was Sonichu versus the four cent garbage American Civil War the American Civil War
01:18:15 That shit's the first good one. Yeah, the first good one since a lot of people died also guns were big
01:18:22 Awesome, I don't know anything about Vietnam war because all the video games about it have Vietnam
01:18:28 Video are there a lot of video games about the Vietnam War? I mean there's a lot of comics and movies
01:18:32 I don't know. There's like battlefields Vietnam kill kill Chinaman the game
01:18:38 There's probably a couple in there. All right. That's it. All right, so we're done with military stuff
01:18:43 Let's we we agreed 10 out of 10 good
01:18:54 Semper fight Dallas to all our armed forces. That's right. Okay
01:19:03 Here's some questions. All right, here's some questions, okay
01:19:06 Here's here's our good buddy at Nat Blasphemous. This guy makes a bunch of art for us. He's a cool guy
01:19:12 Would you give up content creation at least publicly if you could live wherever you wanted and have all needs provided all
01:19:19 need you think about that
01:19:23 I'm imagining like
01:19:25 Like a really crystal clear like blue water beach log house with a pier
01:19:30 And a straw hat roof. I like that, but also I
01:19:37 Guess if all needs means this guy saying everything you want is all taken care of pretty much
01:19:42 Yeah, well a fucking course who wouldn't give up no no see see that that's where you're wrong the answers
01:19:48 No, of course. Yeah, because if you're not doing something you just shrivel up and don't my name exactly exactly right
01:19:55 That's what I want to do. You have to get you have to give up content at least publicly
01:20:00 Yeah, so like you could make it on your own if you wanted to I guess, but you just wouldn't release it
01:20:04 It'd be like your own. I just release it under a pseudo name. Yeah, it like that'd be I think I would not take this well, okay
01:20:11 I I would assume that the the gist of this question is like about if you would still like give up doing this kind of work
01:20:18 Or whatever if like, you know, you can do that sort of or you know releasing it to the public like I I
01:20:23 Mean no because there'd be no point to me doing the kind of work
01:20:26 I do on YouTube if people couldn't see it because the whole point of it
01:20:29 Yeah, people see it. I think I think what the general idea of the question is
01:20:34 Yeah, do you have a creative outlet that doesn't involve people watching it on YouTube? I think you're right on the Internet
01:20:41 I don't I would say I would say yes because I like sculpture
01:20:46 I like the idea of building sculptures if I had like plenty of money and no reason to
01:20:51 Worry about shit. I would just I would make Easter Island
01:20:55 I would buy an aisle I would be on an island and I would make sculptures and then when I'm dead people be like what the fuck happened here
01:21:01 He he also he says like all creative content whatsoever though, right?
01:21:06 He said content creation
01:21:08 Yes, but he said he said he said he said publicly so like you could do it on your own if like
01:21:14 I would
01:21:16 Statues I would I would build cool fucking statues over an island until I'm dead and then then people will find them
01:21:25 In my head the whole time
01:21:27 That wouldn't be public. That would be like invasion of private property. Yeah, let's let's just say nobody can find it for whatever
01:21:32 Okay, well, it's gay. No, I like making things and people to see yeah, I like
01:21:40 me I
01:21:41 Agree completely. Well, all my needs met includes a human being so like they're the you know company
01:21:47 Like I wouldn't want to live on my own forever. That's just generally shit
01:21:52 Okay, we're just talking about the content creation. You can just still be out and talk to people and whatnot
01:21:56 You know dumb question because it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't really make any sense. That's okay
01:22:00 That's like everything except the one thing that you also like
01:22:04 Like
01:22:07 I'd like everything and and that to mean everything not everything minus
01:22:12 Fuck you. I'm lost in the woods on this one. Okay. Let's go to another question here at read or Darrell asks
01:22:18 What are your thoughts on the announcement for the American live-action TV show adaptations for one piece cowboy bebop and
01:22:25 SAO is that TV show?
01:22:28 Oh
01:22:29 about
01:22:30 Cowboy bebop may actually be good because it's already pretty westernish
01:22:36 I mean, I could see that that making a neat transition one piece
01:22:42 Garbage instantly. I know it will be. Mm-hmm. I
01:22:45 Mean, I've seen cosplayers white people cannot look like those characters at all
01:22:51 I don't think anyone can in real life. They're too cartoony. I just don't want to see that
01:22:54 No, I've seen I've seen a pretty good. I've seen a pretty like a few pretty good-looking Japanese men being Sanji and
01:23:01 Yes, that's they pull that off. But like imagine imagine like someone trying to be Frankie just to picture it like no
01:23:08 No, it can't be done. It cannot be done
01:23:16 Okay, go get what were you saying give I
01:23:18 Was gonna say it's like the Super Mario Bros movie what Bowser's just a guy
01:23:22 Well, that was cool because it was so fucking weird, but I mean at the time I was very confused
01:23:27 But like that's what I'm imagining. You'll be like, oh, it's a guy
01:23:29 But he's got like tattoos of stars on his hands
01:23:32 I don't even it's legit like TV shows of cowboy bebop SAO and one piece
01:23:37 They're getting TV like I heard about the cowboy bebop movie like that was a thing a TV show. Is this real?
01:23:41 Where's he getting this news? I don't know. I'm just going to assume that it's correct
01:23:44 I did I did hear the one I did hear the one piece one. Yeah, that's the one I did here
01:23:50 I'm gonna enroll in a high school. I hope you want to join the football team with me
01:23:54 I would love nothing more than that
01:23:59 Jesus Christ
01:24:01 The only thing they'll make this good if we've got mum key D
01:24:05 Luffy on the team. Let's bring him in. I like the idea that it's not just a high school setting
01:24:11 But it's a high school setting where it's just like he is. He's just into football. Yeah
01:24:16 Oh kind of like those
01:24:19 Character that it's about remember one cuz remember that one like the sometimes Oda will do like a little side thing where he tells like a
01:24:25 Like a three-page story about like all universe straw hats
01:24:27 Remember the one where Luffy was like a super studious student and all he wanted was to like get into like the number one school in the country
01:24:33 And he was like that was his like pirate king thing like be the best student and get into this school like that's you know
01:24:40 You don't remember that one. I
01:24:42 Don't that's where shanks is like their teacher and you just told him to be degenerates and like not worry about it
01:24:47 Are you talking about like the little pages of like question answer things?
01:24:51 No, they weren't the SBS like so Oda's done a couple of these like
01:24:55 Stories where it's just like all the care all the straw hats are like different characters in like a different world like there's one where
01:24:59 They're all literal family members and like, you know Zoro's the dad
01:25:04 I'll have to link you. Yeah, they're great. They're really really good
01:25:07 Me Luffy. I'm not gonna. Oh, I bumped told you to some guy
01:25:11 Fucking way. God. This is a fucking nerd. Oh my god. That was another member of my fucking anime crew
01:25:18 We're gonna bond now in the kitchen. Oh
01:25:24 What a nightmare right? Okay, let's move on. This is this topic is killing munchie
01:25:30 I
01:25:32 Okay, here we go
01:25:33 Benjamin with at Benjamin Whistle asks what game have you played the most would you say it's your favorite?
01:25:41 Undertaker
01:25:44 I'm gonna Google search how many
01:25:50 Okay, I'm just gonna say the game. I've played the most without a doubt is
01:25:54 Decidia Final Fantasy the first one for PSP. I played that game every night for hours for years every day
01:26:04 And I it was the greatest. I am a real Final Fantasy fan guys. All right. I love Final Fantasy
01:26:11 It's my favorite and this was everything I ever wanted finally made real
01:26:15 Yeah
01:26:21 Damn, I hate that guy. I'm gonna beat him up. It sounds like a bitch
01:26:26 Yeah, that that game wouldn't isn't my favorite. No, but it is really really good and I loved it
01:26:30 I was doing coming out from ps4 soon. Yeah, Ramza fucking Ramza. Okay, but I'm fine now
01:26:37 Ramza one half
01:26:39 Hey, I played by far the most of Team Fortress 2
01:26:45 2,672 hours on record first played that in like
01:26:53 2012 I think early 2012. Okay. It's one of my favorite games. I mean not my favorite
01:26:59 But yeah, what like top five I would say I love team Fortress 2 too bad
01:27:05 It's game horrible now, and I would never fucking play it ever except for the time. They're like legacy servers. No
01:27:12 No, oh, it's just dead. It's just gone. Yeah, that sucks
01:27:18 Gibb is yours is it RuneScape the one you've played the most. I'm just guessing here. Is it RuneScape?
01:27:23 Um, I would say no because World of Warcraft
01:27:26 I would when I was into World of Warcraft. It was like all right. I've just woken up time to turn on computer
01:27:33 Warcraft I gotta play I gotta do it. Oh, I gotta get ready for school. I can I can get in 30 minutes of World of Warcraft
01:27:41 You know that was me the good thing was that I it didn't affect me too much
01:27:46 That's good like other aspects of my life. I was already a loser. Oh, it was all fine
01:27:52 It was all it was all meant to be
01:27:54 Probably one of the heights of my gaming career was one day
01:27:57 I was playing Mario Luigi Bowser inside story and mine like I was I was just I just stayed up all night just playing it and
01:28:03 And I like I wasn't even like at the final boss or any like it like you know story moment
01:28:08 I was just like the fucking like just the third level just midway through my mom knocks on the door like hey
01:28:12 It's it's time for school. You have to go I open the door and I'm fucking just like crying like mom
01:28:17 I want to keep playing Mario. Oh
01:28:21 No
01:28:23 Please I got my knees. Please. Let me play Mario. Please and she's not healthy
01:28:31 Christ what she do what you do sure I guess
01:28:36 So you just got to stay home and play Mario this day. Yeah. Yeah, just that day and then like the next day
01:28:41 I just didn't care. I just didn't care the next day. Yeah, all right
01:28:45 I just cared so much about playing just like I didn't even like beat the game
01:28:49 I just continued to play for like a couple hours and then I just shut it off like for just some reason
01:28:56 I just wanted to play very badly. The way what those were fake tears
01:29:00 I was legitimately crying for the like I just couldn't I couldn't play Mario for like six hours. What the fuck?
01:29:08 Sometimes I like that before uh-huh go ahead give I
01:29:12 Felt that though those feelings before it's like like I'm just really into something and I
01:29:18 Deliberate it on whether it was okay to bring my my GBA to school
01:29:22 Like if it was it really into playing fire emblem or something. I was like, uh, I've been playing it all night
01:29:28 I want to play more
01:29:29 Could I bring it to school? No, no, the bullies will take it
01:29:32 I never I never had bullies that would take things but I I always felt like if I had my
01:29:37 GBA I wouldn't be able to bring it out during class because the teacher would take it
01:29:42 I wouldn't be able to bring it out during you know in between times because the people would say what are you a gamer?
01:29:48 Kill me. Oh, no can't take that risk
01:29:53 So I never brought it to school, but there was one time when I saw a guy he brought it to his to school
01:29:57 I was like you motherfucker. You're so brave. How do you do that?
01:30:02 He's the real veteran here not the name of these fucking, you know boys and blue
01:30:07 Did you learn from that? Yeah, you're right. Did you learn for that? Did you bring it after that? No, no
01:30:13 I brought my game boy to school like for years every day
01:30:16 I was just so paranoid of like of of of turning on the game and sitting down and then having people come over and say
01:30:24 Oh, what game you playing and then I would shrivel up and be like, I don't know
01:30:31 That's what I would have said
01:30:33 Okay, here's a here's a good question. I'm at rum raisin seven asks. Um, why is munchies so bad at Kirby?
01:30:39 You know, that's a good question. It's a very good question
01:30:51 That's what that is that's a fake thing. It's a fake fucking made-up fact
01:30:59 Whether you can check with the government
01:31:01 Go check out the the Kirby race. Everybody's is great. Um, okay, here we go
01:31:09 Yeah, you that's true, you know, that's really it's funny that like it's just because you got more invested than me
01:31:14 Yeah, because you got more invested you got rocked harder
01:31:25 At Jip clip C asks why don't PCPs last for more than an hour now?
01:31:31 Actually, I know the reason I just want them to be longer. Well, we're already an hour and what like 20 minutes
01:31:36 Yeah, we're over an hour and a half now. So I don't know what fuck you dude. I think I think what it is is that
01:31:44 Sometimes
01:31:45 There's less people and if there's loads of people and it's a big topic. Yeah, everyone wants to get everything in but now
01:31:53 When the topic sucks
01:31:55 Sometimes it does and none of us have like enough to say each even if we all get a turn so
01:32:03 That's why
01:32:05 Pretty robust. It was with three people. It was still over an hour
01:32:10 There was gonna be way more people like and by way more I just mean like six or
01:32:15 Two more but they just didn't show up. So we were like we were we gonna flowers
01:32:19 I was at least I did had no idea working talking about this actually turned out pretty good
01:32:23 Yeah, the reason though the reason though that everyone's like, oh fucking. Why are they short now?
01:32:28 I've seen that multiple places because unlike the past two
01:32:31 I think but both times have just been like we've been in the middle talking and it's been like alright done BCPS over now
01:32:36 Bye, I don't I don't really think we need to go on that long
01:32:39 I mean we make a good product and we wrap it up. I'm pretty happy with how long they've been going up to now
01:32:45 Yeah, it's just both times
01:32:48 I've met a bit. I've made a big stick about Nate closing the PCP and so they probably like oh much. He's fucking right
01:32:54 We do you're right? I don't know. I'm pretty ill like this one is longer than I expected to be and I'm perfectly happy with that as well
01:33:01 Yeah, yeah, I'm having me. This is fine. Yeah, I'm sick of this shit. I'm pretty fucking fed up TBH
01:33:09 Okay, let's let's let's see. I got the answer another question. Um, oh
01:33:16 Okay, no this question fucking sucks
01:33:20 Okay, maybe you guys can tell me what this means at sys gum 69 our old friend
01:33:26 Can you talk about your head mates?
01:33:29 What does that mean the fuck is that I don't like like the people live with me in my head? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, you know
01:33:35 You know what head mates are? I don't think so the term dude. I have so much like a topa. I have so many head mates
01:33:43 They're like topless, but inside of your physical brain. Is it like a split personality thing? Is that what it is?
01:33:50 It's it's okay. So here's what you do you pretend that you're insane. That's the first right pretend
01:33:56 That you're insane then when you when you're making your sick-ass fucking form posts that you just you know
01:34:02 You love to make every single day you laugh so hard making these posts that you just drop your fucking pretzels out on the ground
01:34:09 That those sick ass whores while you're making those
01:34:12 Just like in it. Just like enter colon
01:34:15 Barack Obama
01:34:17 Darth Sidious, you know the Martian from Looney Tunes any of those guys colon. Yeah, just have him say something retarded
01:34:25 Just say that okay, it'll make it better. That'll be your head mate
01:34:28 Just pretend that those fictional characters are inside of your brain
01:34:32 And then you say funny fucking quips that make everyone like you on your phone post guy online tumblr fucking
01:34:40 Yeah, yeah, all those or chan.org slash co all those nice places
01:34:46 Just get your fucking head mates to say some sick ass
01:34:50 Nihilistic wicked sense of humor shit and everyone will love you. That's what head mates are
01:34:56 Yeah, I I've done this a couple times
01:35:00 Like like quite that intense but like
01:35:04 You know every so often like I'm walking home from school and I'm like I
01:35:08 Feel like talking about something, but there's no one there
01:35:12 So I've just imagined what the possible counter arguments could be like a person doesn't agree with what I said
01:35:19 So I just argue with him and just talk in my head. They don't have different voices. They're just like saying different things like
01:35:28 Blah blah blah. I don't know about that and then you know, I just go go through the motions of this thinking about it
01:35:35 It's usually just to think it's just a way to think through just to imagine that there's another person that I am being also
01:35:43 Is that what it is or is it just I love I mean, I'm sure that's practically what it is or you know in a practical sense
01:35:49 Yeah, that's what it is. What people say is this is the fictional characters live inside their brain and then they talk to them
01:35:55 sometimes and and
01:35:57 I don't have characters and and and then sometimes in and on a blood moon one of those fictional characters will take over their physical form
01:36:07 Then like role play that character themselves these people are so special and impressive and amazing
01:36:14 I I wish I was as cool as them. They're so cool
01:36:18 Vampire Hunter D is now at the front. He's at the front now. I am him
01:36:24 I
01:36:25 Like the fact that vampire Hunter D has the has the feels the knees to explain that he is yes
01:36:31 This incredibly quiet reserved character who changed my entire way acted by never saying a fucking word announces himself in the room
01:36:38 I am
01:36:41 Everyone it's me. I'm real. I'm here. Yes. That's very in
01:36:46 That's the question the the question was
01:36:52 Can you talk about your head mates was the
01:37:01 Yeah, the rich personality of Darth Maul really takes up a large chunk of my head
01:37:06 Yeah, he's got a lot to say let me tell you
01:37:08 He's a fucking asshole
01:37:12 He's a fucking red-pilled Trump supporter piece. No. No, I go with him all the time about shillery
01:37:18 I should be fucking locked up and he just won't write fucking you won't take any of it
01:37:23 He's a big John Oliver fan
01:37:24 He always wants to switch the channel even when I'm trying to watch you know Sam hides world peace to get my red
01:37:30 pillow might my swastika's in
01:37:33 He's won't use won't fucking do it. I fucking hate you Darth Maul. I've got Odie from Garfield
01:37:38 Yeah, Odie and Darth Maul do not get to well together at all. They're like
01:37:44 They are exact Odie's the most migtail fucking
01:37:53 Oh
01:37:54 Cuz he's always making fun of Darth Maul's masculinity and it doesn't get pretty
01:38:03 The munchie actually has a lot of characters in this fucking head of course of course and I just Napoleon Bonaparte
01:38:09 Just had just hanging out. He's a military guy. I should have had him come to the front of consciousness for this debate
01:38:15 That would have been helpful
01:38:16 Unfortunately, all he does is play well in league and he doesn't have time to come to the front of my
01:38:21 So, you know, it's it's a real shame
01:38:23 Maybe yeah, we can one day we can do like a bonus episode. That's us with our head mates, you know
01:38:28 Just like being themselves that'd be nice. That'd be a nice episode
01:38:31 What what makes you guys have hold hippo? Oh good question
01:38:37 Give
01:38:42 I

01:42:20 It's spooky. It's kind of like in um
01:42:23 Scooby-Doo. For some reason it reminds me of breath of the wild only breath of the wild isn't flying
