00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Digibro and I am doing yet another interview this time with the Endless One himself, Mr. Endless Jess.
00:00:11 The people demanded it. They were barreling down the doors for an interview with yours truly.
00:00:16 Let's talk about right off the bat how butthurt, Ben and Nate are. How butthurt they are right now as we speak, still being butthurt, talking amongst themselves, screaming and whining like petulant babies in the chat as we're talking.
00:00:29 Oh my god. I'm Ben. I'm the best guy ever and everyone just wants to hear from Endless Jess.
00:00:36 What's so great about him? Well you know I'm sorry guys. Maybe you should put in the work to become the most entertaining motherfucker on the face of the earth in the entire history of humanity every day of your life.
00:00:46 It's that simple. Just get good. The people will want to hear more from you if you just get good, faggots. That's why they want me.
00:00:54 That's why they call out for a savior, for Endless Jess to come down from my throne in Valhalla and bring a little brightness into their lives with that special gift of gab that only I have.
00:01:06 Not you, me. Only I. That's why they want me. That's why they love me. That's why they don't love you. That's why they beg for me when you're on screen.
00:01:13 I knew that rant was coming at the start of this.
00:01:18 So Jesse, you and I have been friends for a good, what, god, three years now?
00:01:26 Yeah, it's about three years. It's gotta be.
00:01:28 Holy shit. That's a long fucking time. Other than Tom, if you were a woman, I'd have thrown you to the curb by now. I would have gotten sick of you after two weeks.
00:01:40 I think other than Tom, you're probably the longest still active friendship I have on the internet.
00:01:48 My oldest friend. The good old old school fool with that old school cool. The Endless one.
00:01:56 So to start with, I want to ask you some stuff about your backstory.
00:02:03 Particularly where your persona and comedy, not so much persona, but you have this very self-aggrandizing attitude.
00:02:13 You're definitely a big fan of your own work and you think you're better than everybody else.
00:02:21 And I want to know how that came to be.
00:02:26 Because some people say that. Some people say that he's arrogant or egotistical or too much of a fan of himself.
00:02:32 But then at the exact same time, other people go, oh, he's too self-deprecating. He's just too down in himself and mopey and whiny.
00:02:40 Well, which is it, you stupid motherfuckers?
00:02:42 Gee, maybe I'm not egotistical or depressed. Maybe I'm just a normal, actual fucking human who's confident in the work that I have put in the effort to know for a fact is good.
00:02:55 Maybe I'm not egotistical. Maybe I just know what I'm good at.
00:02:59 Yeah, I think the impression I've always gotten is sort of that you're self-aware enough to see your own flaws.
00:03:07 But I think that you still seem to think that the net positive is higher than anyone else's net positive.
00:03:14 You know what I mean?
00:03:15 Yeah.
00:03:16 Like, we're all flawed. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, but you have more strengths than anybody else.
00:03:21 That seems to be how you present yourself.
00:03:23 That, and I don't think that anybody on the internet has a right to assume that they know what my flaws are.
00:03:30 Right.
00:03:31 Like, I'm the only fucking person who can criticize me, maybe me and some people who know me in real life, like some girlfriends that I've been dicks to or friends.
00:03:42 You know, anyone who actually knows me, fine, go ahead and say that Jesse, that he smells bad 60% of the time or that he says nigger too much.
00:03:54 If you know me in real life, those are totally valid complaints.
00:03:58 Wait, are you sure you're talking about yourself and not me?
00:04:02 Those are two complaints a lot of people have about me.
00:04:06 I think we are kindred spirits in many ways.
00:04:10 That's probably why we've been hanging out for so long.
00:04:13 I don't know, I just think that, yeah, that's kind of how I feel about criticism on the whole is just that I think that nobody really has the right to criticize art except for the person who made it, because they're the only one who really knows.
00:04:27 I mean, yeah, if you pay to go see a movie, you have a right to say that was a shitty movie, but as far as like, I don't know.
00:04:35 Telling them what they did.
00:04:37 Yeah.
00:04:38 We talked about this in the commenter rules how it's like, or in the authorial intent podcast, so you weren't there for that, I think, but that the only person who really knows what they were trying to do is the author.
00:04:52 And it's like, you can criticize how well it appealed to you, but you can't really criticize what the author was trying to do unless you completely understand what they were trying to do.
00:05:03 So a complaint like, or a complaint like he is an egomaniac or he has too much of an ego.
00:05:12 Well, how the fuck do you know that? You don't know anything except what you see on a fucking YouTube video that is designed first and foremost to be hilarious and to make me laugh.
00:05:22 Right.
00:05:23 I hate everybody.
00:05:25 I'm already sweating. I'm already at that level.
00:05:29 What I want to know, though, is where your like sort of personality comes from in your past.
00:05:35 Oh, yeah, that was the question we got. I already got way off on something.
00:05:40 If there is any specific point, I guess to lead into it because for me, you know, I've been I've been watching you for a long time and what's unique about our relationship is that we're not just friends, but I'm also a really big fan of your work.
00:05:55 And one of my general favorite content for everyone that I talk to, I don't I have a real problem taking people seriously as human beings if I'm not a big fan of their work.
00:06:07 Right.
00:06:08 I feel pretty similar. It's hard. It's a lot harder for me to like keep up communications with someone if they're not making things because so much of my life is making things.
00:06:19 That's what I want to talk about.
00:06:20 It's the world that I inhabit and I can't it's hard to relate to someone who doesn't inhabit that same world.
00:06:26 Right. And I think that's, you know, I'm probably I'm willing to say more than anyone I am the most invested in your work other than yourself because I watch all of it and I talk to you about it while it's being made.
00:06:39 And so that's good that you are because you're one of the only people that I trust besides myself to articulate my work to anyone.
00:06:48 Because I feel like everybody else in the world explains my videos wrong and it just adds to the growing frustration of nobody getting it.
00:06:56 Like whenever whenever some commenter tries to defend me in the comments, like some guy will be like this guy, he's not funny.
00:07:03 And then like immediately some commenter will rush to my defense.
00:07:06 But instead of just saying, no, fuck you, he's funny.
00:07:08 You're like a comedy subjective or like some normal sounding defense of me, they'll launch right into you don't understand the artistic intent of Jesse's master plan.
00:07:17 This web that he weaves goes beyond what any of us mere mortals can possibly comprehend just from watching a single YouTube video.
00:07:24 It's like, okay, that's just making me sound worse.
00:07:26 That's not helping.
00:07:27 Yeah.
00:07:28 It's true, but it's not helping.
00:07:31 Yeah.
00:07:32 Well, along the line, there was a point towards, I guess, the back end of 2014, where you started up the drowning in kayfave channel.
00:07:42 And you started talking about wrestling and describing like these hours long vlogs describing wrestling history.
00:07:49 And it all kind of culminated in the horseshoe finale.
00:07:52 And it was interesting because I'd known you for a long time by then and I didn't know anything about wrestling.
00:07:57 And then once you explained all of it to me, that's when like your persona finally clicked and I understood what you were trying to do.
00:08:05 Like, I think you're someone who the more you understand where like your influences and where you're coming from, the easier it is to parse what your channel is.
00:08:15 Yeah.
00:08:16 Yeah.
00:08:17 And I.
00:08:18 What?
00:08:19 Yeah.
00:08:20 Oh, sorry.
00:08:21 I think some of the difficulty in that for a lot of people who find the channel is that like, you know, a lot like my little pony fans, for instance, like, where are they coming from?
00:08:30 They're like these high schoolers watching a, you know, a little girls show, maybe didn't grow up with wrestling and don't understand like that this is a type of thing that has existed before.
00:08:42 Because I think if you just stumble upon endless jests with no idea like those kinds of influences, then it's like, why is this man screaming at me?
00:08:53 You know, what did I do wrong?
00:08:55 He seems so angry.
00:08:57 He seems so violent.
00:08:58 But then if you're familiar with something like wrestling where that's the whole entertainment of it is a bunch of violent, crazy people screaming at each other.
00:09:06 Then it's like, okay, I get that this is a form of entertainment that has existed long before you did it, you know, even if you're, you know, obviously putting your own unique spin on it.
00:09:16 Yeah, fuck them.
00:09:18 And you.
00:09:19 That's what you were getting at, right?
00:09:21 Yes, fuck them.
00:09:22 They're all stupid.
00:09:23 Yeah, of course.
00:09:24 They should all burn in a garbage can.
00:09:25 Yeah.
00:09:27 Yeah, I want to know.
00:09:29 So you, you have a lot of influences from like outside YouTube.
00:09:34 Yeah, like, yeah, mostly.
00:09:36 Yeah, I think very few of my influences are within the YouTube sphere.
00:09:41 I mean, I consider James Ralph an influence, but that's about it.
00:09:46 As far as YouTube goes, I come from like, how did you end up on YouTube is what I want to know.
00:09:53 It's just, it was, I don't know, I just kind of fell into, it's just the most convenient platform to get my stuff out, because I don't really, like, I'm a big fan of stand-up comedy and I'm a big fan of doing stand-up comedy.
00:10:07 I've only done it a few times, but every time I did it, I felt really good.
00:10:11 I was like, hyped and amped for like a week afterwards.
00:10:14 It was like, yeah, that felt really like stand-up comedy, like being on a stage in front of real people in like a, in like a little club or some, any place with a microphone.
00:10:22 It just feels to me more legitimate than YouTube.
00:10:26 And I know that we disagree about that because you always say that YouTubers should take YouTube more seriously as its own thing.
00:10:33 And I agree with that to a point.
00:10:35 But for me, something about YouTube, it just feels like a website for talentless assholes.
00:10:40 And I deeply resent everything about it.
00:10:42 I resent YouTube culture.
00:10:43 I hate reviewers and critics.
00:10:44 They're all fucking smarmy, sarcastic twats.
00:10:47 I hate every fucking agenda pushing blow hard, trying to scream his opinion on politics or the societal ills affecting our generation.
00:10:56 Like, who gives a fuck?
00:10:57 You're all asshats.
00:10:58 You all belong in the trash.
00:11:00 I just, I can't stand it.
00:11:01 To me, it just feels like a big fucking circle jerk.
00:11:04 It's a treehouse for babies is what YouTube is.
00:11:06 It's a sewer full of poop floating around poop.
00:11:10 I definitely think it's lowered the overall standard of what you have to be to be good.
00:11:17 Because old media or stand-up comedy, only the absolute most popular people make it anywhere.
00:11:26 The overwhelming majority of stand-up comedians are still in dive bars in their 30s and not making any progress.
00:11:35 Whereas on YouTube, you can just, like, not even be that talented, but because you're talking about video games, people find you, you know?
00:11:45 Or because you're talking about, like, a certain thing, you can be found.
00:11:48 Not to say that everyone does get found.
00:11:50 Just, like, there's plenty of talented people, like yourself, who, in spite of covering a lot of popular stuff, have never really taken off in that big, viral way.
00:12:00 But you are making a career off of it, even in spite of that.
00:12:04 Which has always impressed me that you have, like, you make an amount of money that no, I don't think anyone would expect from someone with your audience.
00:12:15 I mentioned that in Horseshoe Finale. It was one of my many acrimoniously spewed points.
00:12:21 It's not spewed. Spewed implies a lack of articulation.
00:12:26 But I mean, it was one of the many things that I launched at people.
00:12:31 It's true. Because you don't, to me, Patreon is a better measure of success than, like, YouTube subscribers.
00:12:39 Because the patrons will fucking leave if they don't like what you're doing anymore.
00:12:43 And to anyone can attract viewers, but to attract people who think, I care about this person as an artist.
00:12:53 I care about them being able to continue their work. So I'm going to give them some of my money every month.
00:13:01 That, to me, is a far better measure that I'm connecting or accomplishing something good.
00:13:07 I definitely think that, like, it's a direct response to quality and to, you know, like, with the fucking Asterisk War videos.
00:13:16 Like, when the last episode of that came out, my Patreon jumped unbelievably.
00:13:21 Like, it had never done before. And it wasn't that I was getting any more views than normal.
00:13:26 It was just people were so excited about that particular video series that it, like, struck such a chord with them that they threw all their money at me.
00:13:34 And every once in a while, like, the last video I did, like, ten best things happening in anime this decade,
00:13:39 like, a video like that that just makes people feel something will definitely cause them to patron.
00:13:46 And so, even though you've got, like, well, I mean, I make a crazy amount of money now, but for a very long time,
00:13:53 I had ten times your subscribers and was making, like, the same amount, you know?
00:13:58 Just because you had people who cared so deeply about the stuff you were making.
00:14:03 Yeah. And a lot of it was, you know, being drowning in horseshoes was such a consistent gimmick.
00:14:11 Like, people knew that they were getting my little pony reviews.
00:14:14 And I knew that after I did Horseshoe Finale and I stopped doing Horseshoe reviews, I knew that it would go down substantially for a long while.
00:14:22 But I was prepared to make that sacrifice because I knew that eventually I would be able to get it back up with my other content.
00:14:29 And I have. It slowly trickled back up to almost where it was.
00:14:33 But that's a source of pride for me, that I was fully aware that it would go down, and it did, and I did it anyways.
00:14:42 Yeah. So, to explain sort of why the two of us know each other, because we've told the story before,
00:14:51 but a lot of our old podcasts are gone now, because we did these old horse casts together, which you took down eventually.
00:15:00 Which is probably for the best, because a lot of the information would be out of date.
00:15:04 I don't like anything that I see, like, more than one year ago is like, I don't consider it me anymore.
00:15:13 Right. I have very similar feelings.
00:15:16 I feel like I'm always a different person than I was a year ago, and I feel like people should be always changing.
00:15:22 I like having all that stuff up from my past so that people can look at it and see that I'm so different,
00:15:29 because I think it's encouraging for new artists who don't know that you have to practice and that you have to evolve.
00:15:38 And you can point to, like, if a 17-year-old tells me, like, how do I get better at writing?
00:15:44 I can link them a post I wrote when I was 17, and they'll be like, wow, this is fucking garbage.
00:15:49 And I'll be like, I know, now you have to practice for 10 years, catch up to me, you know.
00:15:55 But yeah, we had those podcasts before that have since been removed.
00:16:00 But basically, we met because you were one of my first subscribers when I started as Digi Baroni,
00:16:08 and you were the, for a long time, you were the biggest channel that was subscribed to me,
00:16:14 even though you only had, like, 2,500 subs, which to me was a lot, so I was like, oh, this guy's bigger, you know.
00:16:22 And you, like, messaged me, you messaged me once, and I thought that your channel was literally about footwear,
00:16:30 because it was called Drowning in Footwear, I thought it was a shoe review channel,
00:16:35 because I've known some people who are, like, obsessed with shoes, so I just thought, okay, he must be a shoe guy.
00:16:42 And then you messaged me again later when my channel started taking off, and I went and watched your Sin City video
00:16:49 and the Hello Kitty video, and I was like, this guy's a fucking genius.
00:16:53 And I've been evangelizing you ever since.
00:16:57 Yeah, and that's good, because somebody should be.
00:17:00 I often think of you as my ambassador to the world.
00:17:05 I might as well be.
00:17:08 Because I don't like explaining things about myself.
00:17:12 It feels like, like a part of me feels like, first of all, nobody fucking deserves me to explain my work.
00:17:19 Like, yeah.
00:17:20 Like, I just, a couple days ago on June 6th, which was the one-year anniversary of Horseshoe Finale,
00:17:27 I finally sat down and I recorded the one-year anniversary video of it, and I talked about what went into the making of it,
00:17:34 and I talked about a lot of what the video means.
00:17:37 And even though I explained it, a part of me feels like, you people don't fucking deserve this.
00:17:44 It feels like a betrayal, almost, to explain my work.
00:17:47 And also, it's just hard for me.
00:17:49 It's hard to articulate in the moment what I really mean with my art.
00:17:54 It's like you have said before on Digi Bros. about Hideo Kiano.
00:17:57 You know, the medium is the message, and he's clearly so uncomfortable whenever someone tells him to describe Ava
00:18:03 and what it means, like, and I know what Ava is about.
00:18:06 You know what it's about.
00:18:07 If you're, if you're reasonably intelligent, it's not that fucking hard to understand,
00:18:12 but nobody is reasonably intelligent.
00:18:14 That's the one constant about this universe.
00:18:16 So everybody watches it and, you know, slack-jawed with drool rolling down their chin and going,
00:18:21 What happened?
00:18:23 Doesn't make any sense.
00:18:26 And so they ask him about it.
00:18:28 He's like, I don't fucking know what to explain.
00:18:30 It's right there. Just fucking watch it.
00:18:31 Like, the best way that I can explain Horseshoe Finale to me is to point at it and go fucking pay attention, you slime.
00:18:38 And it feels really obnoxious and aggravating that I even have to explain these things.
00:18:43 And it's not like I expect everybody to watch Horseshoe Finale and understand every little tiny word or phrase or reference
00:18:51 or thing in the background 100%.
00:18:53 That would probably be completely impossible unless you were actually me.
00:18:57 But I do expect people to at least get the themes.
00:19:01 Like, nothing makes me madder than the fact that to this day people will watch that video and go,
00:19:07 Oh, this is, he hates bronies. He's mad at bronies. He's leaving the fandom.
00:19:11 That's what this video is about.
00:19:13 That makes me sick. It makes me sick to my fucking stomach.
00:19:15 I want to, I'm, I'm kind of repeating everything that I'm about to be saying in the video that I'm releasing
00:19:21 because this is basically the same rant that I went on.
00:19:24 All right, well, I'll just cut you off then.
00:19:27 Wait, shit. Now I lost track of what I wanted to say.
00:19:30 Oh, yeah. You know, I, I've been planning.
00:19:34 But what I was saying, wait, let me go back.
00:19:36 Anyways, what I was saying is that it's aggravating and frustrating for me to in the moment be put on the spot
00:19:41 and have to explain my things because I can do it if I sit down and I write it out.
00:19:45 But it's hard to figure out because, you know, I put so much of it into the medium is the message.
00:19:51 And you're a lot better than me, I think at, at vloggy type off the cuff explanation
00:19:57 because we both do vlogs and I think we're both good at it.
00:20:00 But like we're, we approach it differently in that I'm a, I'm a performer.
00:20:07 I'm, you're informative and I'm performance driven.
00:20:10 Like when I turn on a vlog, my instinct is to be energetic and funny and say funny things.
00:20:15 And that's what I'm good at. You're better at actually giving out information.
00:20:19 And I hate doing vlogs in general because every time that I do a vlog, I watch it back
00:20:24 and I feel like I could have just written it out and I could have said it a million times better.
00:20:28 This is just going to confuse people more.
00:20:30 But the problem is that when I write it out, it becomes a project and a project takes a lot longer to make
00:20:35 and then it piles on.
00:20:36 That's exactly why I've gotten into vlogging.
00:20:38 Yeah, it's so much easier to just like rant.
00:20:42 It's easier to, it's so much easier and quicker to do a vlog,
00:20:45 but I am always left with the feeling that I've articulated myself like an animal would after I do a vlog.
00:20:50 I feel the same way where I, all of my vlogs definitely have more comments from people who don't understand
00:20:58 than a typical video would, but some of those ideas aren't worth a whole project.
00:21:05 You know, like talking about the two anime I just did where I was laying on the couch.
00:21:09 Like I don't want to write a video about those.
00:21:11 It's okay if some people don't get it.
00:21:13 I just wanted my thoughts out there.
00:21:14 And that's why I almost think of you as my ambassador a lot of the time or like the ambassador to my art
00:21:19 because I feel like when you're in a position where you have to explain what the hell I'm doing,
00:21:26 you're usually better at explaining it than I am.
00:21:29 Yeah.
00:21:30 Well, I thank you first of all and I like doing that for a lot of people.
00:21:35 Like I do that for anyone I encounter who can't explain themselves.
00:21:40 I like to be able to try and explain what they're trying to say,
00:21:44 which is why I've always said that I think I'm good at creative intent,
00:21:48 like getting it because I really search for it more than I think most people do.
00:21:53 Yeah.
00:21:54 Definitely.
00:21:55 And I think more people should.
00:21:56 That's like a big hang up of mine, really, that more people should.
00:21:59 Yeah.
00:22:00 I mean, I don't think it's the only way, like I think you can make interesting points about something
00:22:05 without caring about, you know, while doing the whole death of the author thing.
00:22:09 But I think that for me, most often the author's thoughts are the most interesting, you know,
00:22:16 like nothing's cooler than what the guy was trying to say.
00:22:20 That usually is what gives you the most meaning.
00:22:22 I think that, um, I think that like nobody uses 10 scores right.
00:22:26 I think you did a video on this very topic, but our opinions are,
00:22:30 I think are like directly opposite.
00:22:32 I don't remember exactly what you said.
00:22:34 Yeah.
00:22:35 You're very like everything's a 10 or a, or not a 10.
00:22:38 Well, like to me, I just think that like intent is kind of what I look for most
00:22:43 when I dole out my number scores.
00:22:45 Like I think that not enough people pay attention to intent.
00:22:49 And if you're a, if you consider yourself a critic or a reviewer,
00:22:53 I think you have a responsibility to try to understand what they were going for
00:22:58 and not just look at it through like this narrow,
00:23:00 like when people complain about the cut scenes in Uncharted,
00:23:03 have you played a fucking Uncharted game before?
00:23:06 Did you not know it?
00:23:07 You put in the fucking PlayStation 4?
00:23:09 Did you not know what you were getting into?
00:23:11 They didn't like Uncharted 4 does not have a lot of cut scenes by accident.
00:23:15 They, they wanted to make a game with a bunch of cut scenes.
00:23:18 So you have to judge it as that.
00:23:20 If you don't like cut scenes, that's fine,
00:23:22 but you can't fucking sit there like a petulant baby and go,
00:23:25 there's too many cut scenes in this game.
00:23:27 It's the game is supposed to have cut scenes.
00:23:29 You idiot.
00:23:30 Yeah.
00:23:31 I would agree with that, uh, that sentiment.
00:23:34 Ooh.
00:23:35 So I have been for a very long time trying to like,
00:23:39 literally be an ambassador for you and, and write a video.
00:23:43 There was a time back in the horseshoe days where I completely wrote out a script
00:23:47 and I'd sent it to you that was like explaining why Jesse is cool.
00:23:53 Um, and I just never got around to making it.
00:23:56 And then now I've been inspired that I want to literally rip off
00:24:01 Nerdwriters understanding art formula and do an understanding art on Endless Jest.
00:24:08 And the reason is that like, because I keep saying that I think YouTube is so important as like a medium and everything
00:24:14 and I want to see it advancing is that like, you're my favorite YouTuber.
00:24:18 And I think I probably take YouTube more seriously than anybody else.
00:24:22 I watch way more of it than anybody I know.
00:24:25 Um, like, I, I, I care a lot about like where it's going.
00:24:30 And, um, in the process.
00:24:33 It's funny because when I think about like what I tried to do,
00:24:39 and in my mind I accomplished completely 110% what I tried to do because I'm a genius.
00:24:44 But when I think about, um, the horseshoe saga and leading in the horseshoe finale,
00:24:49 um, I really think that I did my part to elevate YouTube as an artistic medium.
00:24:56 And I don't think people are ever going to really recognize that.
00:24:59 I don't, or if they do, it's going to be a long time before anyone looks at it and thinks that.
00:25:04 But I think I did.
00:25:05 And it's funny to me that I would think that of myself because I'm the guy who probably hates YouTube the most
00:25:11 and respects it the least as a medium in the first place.
00:25:15 But I tried, dammit, I tried to save you all.
00:25:20 Well, the way I want to start this video, because you, the very first video on your channel, on Endless Jest,
00:25:26 if anybody goes there now, it wasn't the first YouTube video you ever did.
00:25:30 There's been removed ones.
00:25:32 But the first one that's up, it starts in such a perfect way for revealing what the point of Endless Jest is.
00:25:40 Because the first scene is you going, yeah, it's you going,
00:25:45 fuck, this game's too hard.
00:25:47 And then you put the controller down and you go, you idiots don't even realize.
00:25:51 I'm not even in the game right now.
00:25:53 I'm not playing a game.
00:25:55 I'm not even in the TV room.
00:25:56 And that was the first official drowning of footwear video.
00:25:58 So even like the first five seconds of my YouTube career was already subverting what was popular at the time.
00:26:04 Subverting video game reviews.
00:26:07 It's all about just sort of pulling back.
00:26:08 And that's all that I do.
00:26:09 And I hate that people don't understand satire.
00:26:11 I hate that people don't get subversion.
00:26:13 Like, I still get it because really I still do it.
00:26:16 Like all my videos in some way are meant to be a subversion or a parody or a satire or something.
00:26:22 Like, for example, that series of videos that I did, the best review.
00:26:28 Fuck, in Batman v Superman, the best review.
00:26:32 And best is in all caps, like it's clickbait and stuff.
00:26:34 Like, the whole point of those videos, like the joke is that it says the best review.
00:26:42 And then you click on it and it's a two hour irreverent vlog that makes no sense and is completely retarded.
00:26:47 And people in the comments go, this is stupid.
00:26:50 It's just a two hour irreverent vlog that makes no sense and is retarded.
00:26:53 That's the joke, dummies.
00:26:55 Congratulations.
00:26:56 Get out of my fucking YouTube.
00:26:58 You're stinking up the joint.
00:27:01 Uh, that's, yeah, that's also kind of what the joke is with, um, with Victor's movie news where it's like.
00:27:07 Which I love, by the way.
00:27:09 I said that, I said that that was the best video you've ever made.
00:27:12 And then you said, well, actually, Victor pretty much was in charge of all of it.
00:27:15 Yeah.
00:27:16 No, Victor wrote, directed, staged, did everything.
00:27:19 It was his, his debut on YouTube.
00:27:21 And it is supposed to be a weekly series.
00:27:24 So expect more of that.
00:27:25 That was though.
00:27:26 That like your performance in it though was like the perfect, like the essence of DigiBro.
00:27:30 Like that's what I want the world to see DigiBro as.
00:27:33 Me too.
00:27:35 Um, but yeah, like the idea of it was that it looks like this click bait.
00:27:40 Like, you know, here's the hit new movies and then it's just like this weird dry Eric Andre show ripoff.
00:27:47 Um, but yeah, like I feel like all of your videos are sort of about taking what, uh, what YouTube is and playing with the meta of it.
00:28:02 You know, in a lot of ways you're like the house of leaves of YouTube.
00:28:06 And I know you haven't read that book, but the way it's structured and written is that it's essentially like Ben and my Amazon cart for two years because you keep talking about it.
00:28:17 I mean, if we ever, uh, when we do this whole rad con that we're planning, uh, you could just, uh, read it.
00:28:24 I'll loan it to you or something as I have it.
00:28:27 Um, but I don't know.
00:28:30 I could see you getting pissed off with it because the way you have to read it is so confusing.
00:28:34 Um, but it's a lot like your videos.
00:28:37 How dare anybody challenge me but me?
00:28:40 How dare any other creator think that they're clever?
00:28:44 Well, this is coming from a guy who, uh, tried to read Homestuck without reading the chat logs.
00:28:50 Yeah, we don't need to get into that.
00:28:54 I don't get Homestuck, man.
00:28:56 Yeah, we're not going to talk about Homestuck.
00:28:58 We should just do the, we should just do the Homestuck fucking, the people versus endless Jess for Homestuck podcast.
00:29:05 Because it's not going to go well.
00:29:07 I know it's not going to go well.
00:29:08 That's what, that's what annoys me is because every time we talk about Homestuck, it turns into a huge, screaming, intense argument and nobody ever hears it because it's never being recorded.
00:29:17 It's literally just us legitimately fighting amongst ourselves and it's going to waste every time.
00:29:23 Yeah.
00:29:25 I'm glad that's the kind of content you want from us.
00:29:29 It's just us all fighting and getting legitimately pissed off.
00:29:33 Mostly Ben.
00:29:34 Ben gets legit mad.
00:29:35 It's like he can't, like, you know, I got real mad the first time we argued about it.
00:29:40 But ever since then, I'm just like, well, whatever, Jesse hasn't read it.
00:29:43 He doesn't get it.
00:29:44 I don't care, you know, but like somehow Ben can't not get mad when you talk about Homestuck.
00:29:50 Like, it's not even that I hate it.
00:29:53 Like, I don't think I hate it.
00:29:54 I just, I hate it.
00:29:57 I haven't read it.
00:29:58 I just hate it.
00:30:00 Yeah.
00:30:01 Instinctively.
00:30:02 Yeah, I don't know.
00:30:04 I mean, it's pretty similar to your work, though, in that regard of being like something complex and meta.
00:30:11 It's because three years ago, I got into a Facebook flame war with a fucking Vriska cosplayer.
00:30:16 And from that point forward, I deemed that Homestuck was the gayest thing ever because this guy was the most annoying person.
00:30:22 But you somehow can still enjoy my little pony in spite of having met all the bronies.
00:30:27 Yeah, well, I'm the best bronie, so I guess it balances out.
00:30:30 I'm as good as the rest of the bronies are terrible.
00:30:34 That's what makes me still able to enjoy the show.
00:30:39 Yeah, I guess we should, I was talking to Ben during my interview with him about how, like, did you listen to that, by the way?
00:30:48 I think I'm like 40 minutes into it and I pause to go fuck around or whatever.
00:30:52 Okay, you might have heard this part, I'm not sure.
00:30:54 I was saying that, like, what makes me sad with Ben is that, like, the T-Bap is, like, the most content that him and Nate did.
00:31:06 And it has so many creative ideas and, like, if I was trying to explain to someone, here's why I think Ben and Nate are, like, great artists.
00:31:15 Then I can't show them T-Bap because it's a fucking weekly My Little Pony review show and it will make no sense.
00:31:21 T-Bap needs to come back and it needs to expand beyond My Little Pony because nobody has chemistry like Ben and Nate have.
00:31:28 No, it's amazing.
00:31:29 They're great together.
00:31:30 And you, though, I have the same problem with, which is that horse shoe finale is your masterpiece and there's just no way I can introduce new people to it.
00:31:43 Because it's such, it's not just the matter of that it's an MLP thing because, like, I honestly think that the horse shoe reviews are mostly, like, the early ones would be the hardest part where it's, like, more legitimately an analysis of the show.
00:31:57 But, like, I feel like the horse shoe reviews get so out there that you could appreciate them without having seen the show, but not having seen the show will make it so confusing.
00:32:07 And the fact that the channel's not even called the horse shoe journey to horseshoes anymore, you know?
00:32:13 I fucked that up so bad.
00:32:14 I did it so backwards because fucking cold corona went off and started horseshoe heaven because I turned drowning in horseshoes into Man Child Incorporated.
00:32:24 I got it totally backwards.
00:32:25 I should have turned drowning in horseshoes into horseshoe heaven and Man Child Incorporated should have been an entirely new channel.
00:32:31 But for some reason I was like, well, I don't want to sacrifice these 10,000 subs, so I should just change, but I did it, I fucked it up so bad.
00:32:38 And now I can never go back.
00:32:39 That's true.
00:32:40 The idea was that that channel had the most subs, so that was the one that had to go corporate and just become a shill channel.
00:32:46 Which I loved the idea of that, but it did make it so you can't go back.
00:32:50 It's a great joke in the moment, but now that I can't go back and I can't rectify it, it was a terrible mistake.
00:32:57 I think that's the biggest issue with all the pony content.
00:33:00 It's not just that it's my little pony, but that we all wrote in such an in-the-moment way.
00:33:05 It's impossible to look back on any of it, even my own work.
00:33:11 The problem with Man Child Incorporated is that the whole joke is that it's soulless and it's like a sell-out channel.
00:33:17 And that's funny, but because it's a sell-out channel, I feel the least investment towards it.
00:33:22 So I never do Man Child Incorporated videos.
00:33:25 It had its point for about a month, and then it completely was like, well, alright, I guess that joke's over.
00:33:35 It was meant to be like the Man Child Incorporated saga.
00:33:40 It has another name, but I can't reveal the other name yet, because if I reveal the other name, I'll spoil it.
00:33:46 It was supposed to be like the semi-sequel slash criticism of the Horseshoe Saga, and it was supposed to culminate right around about Nowish.
00:33:57 But I'm just so I can't fucking, I don't know, it's annoying to fucking make videos on Man Child Incorporated, so it's taking a lot longer than it should.
00:34:08 Well, for what it's worth, I think Horseshoe Finale came out like a year after it was supposed to come out.
00:34:14 Horseshoe Finale, well, the Horseshoe Saga grew so much in the telling, because the original plan, when I made that first Horseshoe review for Princess Twilight Sparkle or whatever,
00:34:27 the idea was this is going to be a dramatization of how I grew as a person during the two years of drowning in footwear.
00:34:37 So, and it's going to, I'm going to make these reviews, and they're going to be really sincere and easy to make at first, and sort of, you know, to get people watching.
00:34:47 And then their reviews are going to slowly become more and more insane and resentful and bitter, and it's going to culminate in CM Punk's pipe bomb.
00:34:58 And I'm going to sit cross-legged, and I'm going to, you know, essentially cut the exact same six minute promo that he cut in 2011 on wrestling.
00:35:06 But change the words so that it would be about bronies, and then drop the mic and end it with that.
00:35:12 And that is still an elemental Horseshoe Finale.
00:35:14 There's six minutes in there where I'm just doing CM Punk's pipe bomb, but all the rest of it.
00:35:20 It's sprinkled about 90 minutes of other stuff.
00:35:22 Yeah, it just grew so much in the, like, and it became so much more than just what I set out to make it.
00:35:28 It became like my artistic footprint of everything that I am and everything that I've ever thought or felt.
00:35:34 And, like, and I'm very protective of it for that reason because, like, that video is me.
00:35:39 I put every fucking part of my soul into that video.
00:35:43 And so, yeah, it became something special unexpectedly, and that's always how it happens.
00:35:49 Everything good sort of happens on its own unexpectedly in the telling.
00:35:53 And I want to note that, like, I knew all this from the beginning.
00:35:58 You told me.
00:36:00 Like, I think I was probably the only one who was around for, like, the plans because this all started in 2013.
00:36:06 Me and you sort of became friends that summer.
00:36:08 Yeah.
00:36:09 And, you know, this was before the Horseshoe Crew was a thing because it really sprung out of all this, where the way you had described it to me was that you saw that there was this,
00:36:19 because I had started working for Equestria Daily.
00:36:21 All these new people were coming out with all these analysis videos and shit.
00:36:24 And you were like, man, I know I can do this better than anyone else.
00:36:29 And it'll be a way to make really easy videos and make a shitload of money and subscribers.
00:36:34 Because, like, at the time you were, you only had the one channel, right?
00:36:39 Drowning in footwear.
00:36:40 Yeah.
00:36:41 Yeah, just drowning in footwear.
00:36:42 And you didn't want to flood it with pony content, but it looked like that was a very quick way to success.
00:36:48 And then you could transform it from there.
00:36:50 And it totally worked.
00:36:52 Like, maybe you didn't get super famous, but it did blow up as a much bigger channel.
00:36:57 Yeah, it blew up at first until my videos started getting more Jess.
00:37:02 Right.
00:37:03 My videos took a very quick nosedive into the boogie realm very quickly.
00:37:10 Because for those first four months, when they were more like, you know, actual typical pony reviews, that's where, like, all the subs came from immediately.
00:37:19 And then once the video started getting more intricate, and I guess weird, for lack of a better term, that's when people stopped subbing.
00:37:27 And I became like this weird underground thing.
00:37:30 Yeah.
00:37:31 I don't know if it's that they stopped or that you were constantly losing and gaining them at the same rate, you know?
00:37:37 Yeah, yeah, that's also possible.
00:37:39 But then it's worth noting that of everyone in the procrastinators, you have the video with by far the most views.
00:37:49 Yeah.
00:37:50 Which is-
00:37:51 And I always will.
00:37:52 Of course two of you bats.
00:37:53 It's got a picture of Fluttershy's ass as the thumbnail and like four million views, I think.
00:37:59 Yeah, four million fucking- I don't know why, I don't know how.
00:38:02 Oh, and by the way, everybody who's listening to this, four million views on that video has never been mine.
00:38:08 Has never been monetized, ever.
00:38:10 Yeah.
00:38:11 Because it very quickly got copyright ID'd as soon as I posted it.
00:38:15 So that's, I mean, what is four million views?
00:38:18 That's gotta be like four thousand dollars, right?
00:38:20 Yes.
00:38:21 That belongs to me that I never received and never will.
00:38:24 Thanks, YouTube.
00:38:25 Yeah.
00:38:26 And unfortunately back then we didn't know as much about fighting content ID's because I'm willing to bet that-
00:38:32 I don't know if you could have at the time, but I think now you could definitely beat that.
00:38:35 Yeah, if it had happened now I probably could have fought it, but...
00:38:39 We didn't know about that shit back then, man.
00:38:41 We would delete videos sometimes just because they got matched, like not even taken down.
00:38:46 We'd just be like, I don't want this to get worse.
00:38:49 Yeah, now what I do is I upload everything on private first and if it gets ID'd, I either change it or I say fuck it.
00:38:57 No one deserves this video when I throw it in trash.
00:39:00 Yeah, I fight everything now.
00:39:02 Now that I realize how easy it is to win, I'm like, oh, hell no, you're not taking my videos.
00:39:07 Yeah.
00:39:08 I'm recutting my PsychoPass video into a full two and a half hour thing and I know it's gonna get a strike
00:39:16 and I don't care because I'm gonna fight it and win and I want this fucking video to exist.
00:39:23 But yeah, man, you have the video with the most views incredibly.
00:39:27 And I mean, everyone's review of bats had more views than normal.
00:39:31 I don't know what it was about that episode because, like, that was my biggest video too,
00:39:35 but mine was like not even 100,000 views and yours was like crazy.
00:39:42 But that's because of the horseshoe, because the procrastinators was originally the horseshoe crew
00:39:47 and it was all because of you because me and you were watching all these new guys,
00:39:55 all these newcomers into the fold and we found Gibb and Take
00:40:00 and we both thought he was hilarious and he did like these videos where he would supercut
00:40:07 like everyone who did analysis videos and he put both me and you in there, I think.
00:40:12 And so we knew that he was like a fan of you on some level.
00:40:15 And then the TBAP had started making these funny videos and they did a Q&A where they like specifically,
00:40:21 they didn't just name drop you, but they name dropped Butchugger.
00:40:24 And you were like, oh my God, they know Butchugger because no one had listened to that.
00:40:29 The true forgotten masterpiece of endless Jess's catalog.
00:40:34 And I gotta say, you know, back then, because, you know, we were friends and I was a fan,
00:40:38 but I didn't, back then I didn't get into all your weirder shit.
00:40:41 Like I just thought it was all too much.
00:40:44 So like I hadn't even heard Butchugger and then like I want to say over a year later,
00:40:49 I finally listened to it and I was like, oh my God, this is fucking masterpiece.
00:40:53 This is amazing.
00:40:56 Highly recommended to all of our listeners, if you haven't heard Butchugger,
00:41:00 it's a six minute ballad that you wrote this epic, would you consider it a hip hop song?
00:41:08 I'm not sure.
00:41:09 Yeah, yeah, I guess it's sort of a rap opera word.
00:41:13 It's a rap opera.
00:41:14 Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
00:41:17 It's about Cody LaRue the Butchugger.
00:41:19 My actual real life friend Cody LaRue who's a comedian and also has a channel called Flint Rant Films
00:41:26 where he is currently working on his ongoing series, Regular Dudes,
00:41:31 which I may one day have a part in.
00:41:33 I haven't yet because I'm very lazy and I'm misanthropic and I don't hang out with people when I say I will.
00:41:38 But it's always a possibility.
00:41:40 Cody LaRue has a hilarious Twitter as well.
00:41:43 Yeah, Cody LaRue is an expert at Twitter.
00:41:45 Yeah, he makes...
00:41:47 I was really shocked that I actually, because I don't follow a lot of people on Twitter,
00:41:51 so when I read how funny his shit was, I was like,
00:41:53 wow, I'm going to follow this totally unknown friend of Jesse's just because he's funny as shit.
00:41:58 He's the Butchugger.
00:41:59 I mean, I'm not sure where this came from, but it must have been like four or five years ago.
00:42:05 He mentioned that he was the Butchugger.
00:42:08 And now if you mention it to him, he staunchly denies it.
00:42:11 He denies that it was ever a thing, that he ever said it.
00:42:14 It's true. He's the Butchugger. Never let him forget.
00:42:17 He can't outrun his past. I won't let him.
00:42:20 The song is there for all time.
00:42:22 Yeah.
00:42:23 Cody LaRue's the Butchugger. He's going to make you his Butchug brother.
00:42:26 His Butchug brother.
00:42:27 Man, I get so hyped for that song and I can't get my friends into it.
00:42:30 It makes me really sad.
00:42:31 This is why I need to abandon all my friends and just adopt you guys.
00:42:35 You all need to come here so I can hang out with you and sing about Butchugging.
00:42:38 Yeah, we all have...
00:42:39 I'm not sure it's worth having friends who don't know the Butchugger.
00:42:42 It seems like we all have our crosses to bear and mine is my family and yours is your friends, your IRL friends.
00:42:52 Yeah. Well, I don't think my friends are nearly as big a problem as your family is.
00:42:57 I don't know if you want to talk about that on here at all.
00:43:00 I don't know. I'm really protective about it, I guess, that aspect of my life because I don't want to seem like I'm whining.
00:43:07 It's that thing where I can say whatever the hell I want about my family, but as soon as somebody else tries to say something bad about them,
00:43:15 I get really protective and I want to beat people up because they don't fucking know.
00:43:18 It's the same way I approach my family.
00:43:20 You would say you don't hate your family, they just cause you most of the problems in your life.
00:43:26 Unnecessary grief.
00:43:28 My youngest sister is literally Zephyr Breeze for anyone who saw the newest My Little Pony episode.
00:43:35 I related so hard to that episode. It was so cool. I was so into it.
00:43:40 Eh, fuck them all.
00:43:43 But that's sort of, so you do live in a basement, right?
00:43:49 Yeah.
00:43:50 It is the basement of your mom's house, so much more literally than Jeff.
00:43:56 I think it's more accurate to say that she lives in my attic because I really fucking hate that.
00:44:02 I get that all the time.
00:44:04 He's in his mom's basement. This guy's the fucking basement. He lives at home.
00:44:07 Like, this fucking living at home stigma, I want to do a video about this so bad because it's a rant that needs to be spoken.
00:44:13 It's the most insane, illogical fucking stigma that we have in society. It makes me fucking sick of my stomach.
00:44:19 As Americans, specifically. It's weird.
00:44:21 Yeah.
00:44:22 Because the rest of the world usually lives with their parents.
00:44:25 Like, if you live in like an Asian country or something, typically you take over your parents' house and you just start paying for it.
00:44:30 Even people our age who don't live with their parents, they have fucking roommates. They have significant others.
00:44:35 They're all splitting the bills and the rent. Nobody is actually living on their own.
00:44:39 So it's such a fucking, like, pot con the kettle black to anyone who fucking looks down at you for living at home.
00:44:44 And by the way, I just want to throw this out there since we're on this topic.
00:44:47 The reason that I live at home, and I don't say this publicly because I like to keep my shit private,
00:44:52 but I'll go ahead and say it. I live at home because I support my entire fucking family.
00:44:56 So suck my ass.
00:44:57 You know, there's this, people say, living at home and it comes attached to this idea that you're a fucking,
00:45:04 that you're just laying around, that you're a freeloader, that they're supporting you.
00:45:08 Most, a lot of us support our families, okay?
00:45:11 I make the most money if anyone in my family because I'm fucking ambitious and the hardest worker I've ever known in my life
00:45:17 and I built the fucking empire on my own as an entertainer and an artist.
00:45:21 And I'm talented enough and charismatic enough to make a living off my art so that I can support my fucking family
00:45:27 and it really, really gets under my skin when I get that living at home stigma shit thrown at me.
00:45:33 It's one of my biggest pet peeves. In fact, as George Carlin would say, I don't have pet peeves.
00:45:37 I have psychotic fucking hatreds and that's one of them.
00:45:40 When people fucking say that to me, I want to lose my mind.
00:45:43 Fuck them.
00:45:45 I completely get where you're coming from, man.
00:45:47 Fake niggaz all looking at me like I don't know what I'm doing.
00:45:50 When I've been pulling salary for creativity since 2013 and I mean, when you see me, what do you think?
00:45:55 That guy's just crazy. He doesn't count. He's an outlier. Anomaly. Surely got lucky somehow.
00:46:01 Now, I'll be the first to admit, I've had some privileges, but I'm seeing all these kids like I ain't done shit.
00:46:06 You're just plugging your own EP right now.
00:46:10 You're gonna be on this song.
00:46:14 Look forward to me and Jess on the album Bedroom Bedrock coming sometime.
00:46:20 By the way, I made an entire album the other night when I got really fucking hammered.
00:46:25 Oh God. It's not like the hymn album, is it?
00:46:28 No, it's better than that. It's like an artistic statement almost.
00:46:32 Okay.
00:46:33 Because the other night I drank an entire bottle of Malibu rum.
00:46:38 I got excessively drunk. I was up all night.
00:46:41 And I did a freestyle rap. Then I did another one. Then I did another one.
00:46:46 I just got some beats offline off of some YouTube channels that make beats.
00:46:50 I did like four complete freestyle raps and these were legitimate freestyles.
00:46:55 Not one fucking second of it was written or rehearsed.
00:46:58 Just read all off the cuff and they're all incredible and hilarious.
00:47:02 I did them one after the other while I was completely fucking totally drunk.
00:47:06 And then to cap it off, I jotted down, still drunk mind you, still completely drunk off my ass.
00:47:13 I jotted down a guitar song and that closes out the album.
00:47:17 And it became weirdly emotional but also like movingly artistic.
00:47:24 I almost said autistic, but I said artistic. That's a very important distinction.
00:47:29 They mean the same thing.
00:47:30 It's not autism. It's artism that I suffer from.
00:47:34 We're all on the spectrum, man.
00:47:36 Yeah, the autism spectrum.
00:47:38 Yeah, I made a whole album the other night while I was drunk.
00:47:41 And then I did a drunk Let's Play.
00:47:43 And then I woke up the next morning and I had the worst hangover of my entire life.
00:47:47 And I vowed to never drink again for the rest of my life. It was horrible.
00:47:51 It was like...
00:47:53 Oh man.
00:47:54 You just reminded me of...
00:47:56 I don't know. Sometimes I feel like you have so many ideas that half of them I remember and you don't even.
00:48:02 So tell me if you remember this one, which was...
00:48:05 You wanted to make a talk show called What's Your Tism?
00:48:08 Yeah, I remember that. Now that you mentioned it, I remember it.
00:48:10 I thought that was the best fucking idea ever.
00:48:12 Yeah, where the point of the talk show was just that all the guests would come in
00:48:17 and everyone would talk about the thing that they are completely neurotic and autistic about.
00:48:21 Because everybody has that one thing.
00:48:23 Yeah.
00:48:24 I definitely think we're all somewhere.
00:48:26 That's a good idea. That's definitely something that we should still do someday.
00:48:29 Yeah, that would be cool.
00:48:31 One of the many ideas in The Endless just vaults that maybe someday we'll get made, but who knows.
00:48:37 If I'm not too busy making chair videos...
00:48:39 A lot of collab ideas that we're just like...
00:48:42 Well, we live too far away because the biggest one is The Plebe and The Weeb.
00:48:46 Which is a show that we wanted to do that's half in the bag but for anime.
00:48:51 But more aggressive and over the top, probably.
00:48:55 Yeah, and I want to go all out with it.
00:48:57 I want to build a set that is like a line down the middle of the room with different sets on each side.
00:49:03 Yeah.
00:49:04 That would be easy enough to do if we lived anywhere near each other.
00:49:09 Then the other idea was that after I started listening to Biggest Problem I had this idea,
00:49:14 the fans should vote at the end of every episode who was The Plebe and who was The Weeb.
00:49:18 Yeah, that's a great idea!
00:49:21 Oh!
00:49:23 I don't know if it would be a good idea to do this,
00:49:26 but on YouTube you can have it like hit like for this guy and dislike for the other guy.
00:49:31 I mean it would give us crazy dislike bars.
00:49:33 Yeah, I'd keep it in the comments I think because I get like a sick feeling seeing the red on that like bar.
00:49:40 Well, the gray.
00:49:42 Oh, is it gray now? God damn it.
00:49:44 They keep changing it.
00:49:46 It's been gray for quite a while now actually.
00:49:48 Well, I don't know because I never get any downvotes because all my videos are masterpieces.
00:49:53 Oh, man.
00:49:55 Well, to go back to the point we were making before I distracted us with that rap verse about living at home,
00:50:02 like yeah, I think there's like this weird idea that existed like 30 years ago of like, you know,
00:50:09 back when everyone left home at 18 and like maybe if you were still at home at 30 it was because like you...
00:50:15 And by the way, the reason they left, the reason everybody left home at 18 was because they got drafted into Vietnam
00:50:21 and then came back and didn't have a fucking home.
00:50:23 It had to fucking go hitchhiking down the freeway like Rambo with all their friends dying from age and orange cancer.
00:50:29 Like, you know, each of my parents kept like a, you know, they're like really surprised that me, Victor and Shay like didn't want to move out.
00:50:39 But like, because they both left home really early, but they were both from like dirt, poor, shitty...
00:50:46 Like my dad had to steal the eat and stuff when he was 18.
00:50:49 He joined the military literally for food and my mom was from a family of like six brothers and sisters with a single mom
00:50:57 and no moral compass whatsoever.
00:51:00 So she just like moved out when she was 16 and, you know, started living with other people.
00:51:04 And it's like, of course, if you raise like a loving family at a good home and you have a well-paying job, why the fuck would your kids want to leave?
00:51:13 Like you guys didn't leave because you were 18, you left because your lives were terrible, you know?
00:51:18 And it's like everybody I know who's my age lives at home and they're not unsuccessful, they're not unmotivated.
00:51:24 I have a friend who's a fucking published writer who's currently in grad school lives at home.
00:51:30 I have a friend who's a professional guitar teacher who fucking went to college for music shit and has a degree in shit lives at home.
00:51:39 You know, these are not fucking, these are not freeloaders. These are fucking adults.
00:51:44 These are motivated adults carving their own path in the world.
00:51:47 They just so happen to live at home because that's the smart thing to fucking do.
00:51:52 Yeah. I mean, I personally, I'm paying $500 a month for rent, mostly just as a sign, like, you know, of the fact that I'm doing work and contributing something to the house.
00:52:03 But the funny thing is, I mean, there's a lot of legitimate reasons to leave home.
00:52:10 If you don't like your parents and you fight all the time, get out of there, you know?
00:52:15 But like if you're supporting them and putting them up, it's a good reason to be there.
00:52:20 And the funny thing is my parents are now planning to leave the house to me and they're moving out.
00:52:26 So, so it's like, I would doubt like I'm who lives at home now, motherfucker.
00:52:33 Right. I want you freeloading parents out of my home.
00:52:39 Oh, they won't be freeloading. They'll probably still be helping me with the running it.
00:52:43 But they they're like, yeah, we know you guys have no reason to leave.
00:52:47 But, you know, we just want to go somewhere quiet and be alone kind of thing.
00:52:52 And like, but yeah, um, yeah, I don't I don't blame you at all, especially because I know that you, you know, you're helping to to pay for your family.
00:53:04 So it's like, it's like they're more reliant on you than you are on them.
00:53:08 So that's why you're there. And I know a lot of people like that. So I don't think it's weird.
00:53:13 But you do technically live in a basement. But it's a cool basement.
00:53:18 Yeah, that's the other thing. My basement fucking rules. Why would anyone not want to live in my basement?
00:53:23 Have you seen this fucking place? I got posters. I got a fucking TV. I got a fucking, I got pirate flags.
00:53:31 I got a couple Oscar statues. This place is a fucking paradise.
00:53:36 Yeah. And it just happens to be a weirdly amazing set for vlogs.
00:53:41 Because there's so every different angle of the room looks different because there's so many like chest high shelves and like weird bookcases and stuff and different poster arrangements.
00:53:52 And it's like every time you film it from a different angle, it feels like a totally different place.
00:53:57 And then you also change up the posters and that just makes it like dizzying sometimes.
00:54:01 It's like me and DeVue were always saying how we couldn't.
00:54:04 It really, the moment I finally got a good sense of the layout of your room was that vlog of you just squeegeeing water while the girl was recording you.
00:54:13 And that was the first time I like completely understood it. And I was like, oh, it's okay.
00:54:19 There's a separate room where the bookcase is. That's like a weird closet room or something.
00:54:26 And to go off on a weird tangent, because I just now reminded this, of all the sets in my room because I sort of have decorated my room for like, it's sort of segmented into sets for my different channels.
00:54:39 And there's like an anime corner. There's a wonderful waifu wall. There's a fucking man child incorporated corner.
00:54:44 And there's the bookcase in the other room with the fucking.
00:54:48 My favorite of the sets, which I haven't used in like years, is the set, the part of the corner where I filmed the like the Sim City and the Hello Kitty vlogs with that like sort of chest high shelf.
00:54:59 And the reason that I haven't filmed there is because I started filming in front of the bookcase for like some horse shoe review at some point, I think.
00:55:07 I think I started in the Grand Theft Auto review, but I started changing the posters around in there and I could never fuck.
00:55:14 It's that poster Tetris. I want to, I want to make a video about this topic too, because my entire life is poster Tetris, figuring out what goes where.
00:55:21 And for two fucking years, I haven't been able to get that corner the way that I wanted to.
00:55:26 And I just recently finally got exactly the right size poster, exactly what I want to fit in that little spot.
00:55:33 And right now the corner looks great. I'm just waiting for the right video to fucking go back to my corner and reveal it.
00:55:39 Because I hate the fucking bookshelf. Every video of me that I'm in front of that bookshelf, it just inherently feels pretentious and stupid to me.
00:55:46 It's my worst set, but it's like, it's just where I naturally tend to stand because it's where the shelf is like level for the camera to sit it on when I'm in a hurry.
00:55:55 So I end up making videos there. I hate that fucking bookshelf set.
00:55:58 I both agree and understand like the bookshelf is definitely my least favorite just because it's so like collapsing in on itself and just looks uneven and weird.
00:56:07 And that corner is my favorite one too because it's got two different shelves that are at different heights and it just makes it look really complicated.
00:56:16 And the worst part is they're right across from each other. So when I'm filming vlogs in the bookshelf, I'm looking at the cool corner and I'm fucking feeling I'm missing it.
00:56:24 And I'm feeling this longing for it, which just makes me so fucking angry and just adds fuel to the fire.
00:56:30 And that's why my vlogs are always so acrimonious. That's why everybody thinks I'm such an angry person.
00:56:34 I just feel a sense of loss for my corner.
00:56:37 See, I tried to do something similar when when I redesigned my room because like because DeVu told me at some point that he finds my room almost as confusing as yours just because I'll film from so many different angles.
00:56:50 So I was planning to do this thing where I was going to make like all these different micro sets and then film in front of all of them and like really make people wonder how big my room was.
00:57:00 Of course, I burst that bubble because I started doing all these vlogs and just showing the whole room.
00:57:04 But like what I the problem is they're too small. Like I put together a shelf of anime DVDs, but then when I sit in front of it, I block the whole shelf.
00:57:14 So like I have no one spot where there's a good wide angle to see like a bunch of shit. It just looks chaotic and random.
00:57:22 But like I just end up going with whatever is the easiest place to like, you know, oh, this shelf is convenient.
00:57:29 I'll throw a chair in front of it and put up a tripod and I'm done, you know.
00:57:33 So yeah, I get the bookcase thing.
00:57:36 How many like how much do you spend on the posters?
00:57:41 A lot. I think most of what I spend is because I I don't know like hmm.
00:57:50 I don't know trying to do the math. Can we just generally talk about your your buying habits which seem to be go out and just drop hundreds of dollars on whatever you see.
00:58:01 Here's the thing like because my family is such a drain on my finances, mostly from my sister, she has an illness that requires a lot of money all the time.
00:58:17 That's how I'll put it. So I just get a lot of my money drained. I like I constantly have to pay the rent.
00:58:26 I constantly have to pay the bills and shit, mainly because so much money goes to her.
00:58:32 So I've gotten into the habit over time of if I spend all of my money, nobody can take it from me.
00:58:41 Right. So it's just like my instinct, like it's like a paranoid because if I save my money, someone's going to get their paws on it eventually.
00:58:50 But if I go out and I see a bunch of like if I go if I like walk into a comic book store, you know, I go, well, I shouldn't spend all this money on comics.
00:59:00 But if I don't, I'm going to lose it anyways. Someone's going to take it from me.
00:59:05 So yeah, so it's my I might as well just, you know, I might as well blow all my money on comics.
00:59:12 And then when my family needs to borrow money, they can fucking borrow it from somebody else because I don't have the fucking money anymore.
00:59:19 I just have comics. Do you want to pay the rent with my comics? You can't do it. Can you motherfucker? I win. Checkmate.
00:59:25 Yeah, it's basically like an investment, except that you'll never get a return on it.
00:59:31 Yeah. But I don't know, I think it's like I understand the plan and I think it's a good idea, even though it sounds insane.
00:59:39 Like I get why you're doing that and I think it works.
00:59:42 Well, the upside to it is that because of what our job is, everything is a write off.
00:59:48 Yeah, that's the best part.
00:59:50 So I just I just go through life.
00:59:52 My my philosophy is I don't have to pay taxes.
00:59:56 I don't know if that's true, but I don't.
00:59:58 It's definitely not true.
01:00:02 Well, I believe that it's true.
01:00:04 Because I I mean, I don't know if I spend as much as you did on stuff I could write off last year, but I still had to pay a thousand dollars,
01:00:13 even after writing as much off as I could.
01:00:15 But yeah, no, I do the same thing.
01:00:17 We're like, I justify every purchase by like, well, this will be in the background of my video.
01:00:21 So this is part of my set.
01:00:23 So, you know, it's it's all justified like like that light novels video I did.
01:00:29 I went to Barnes and Noble and spent like $110 and then I came home and made a vlog about all the stuff I just bought just so I could write it off.
01:00:36 I have a I have a robot in my corner that I bought six months ago because I came up with a robot character for my videos.
01:00:46 And I haven't used it yet, but I'm going to someday.
01:00:50 And that's why she's a write off.
01:00:52 My robot.
01:00:54 I, uh, yeah, I've always loved that, though, that you spend so much and like on your like a lot of it on improving the videos or like,
01:01:03 because you'll buy a ton of new posters, not just because you want them, but because the video will be better by having those posters like,
01:01:11 like, um, and of course, horseshoe finale is like 18 different sets all built around like different characters and themes and stuff like that.
01:01:20 A normal person would spend $30 one time on a green screen and put whatever they want on it.
01:01:26 But I am no normal person.
01:01:28 Yeah, I like practical effects, practical sets.
01:01:32 Yeah, same here.
01:01:33 I mean, I've emulated that like the reason my walls are all covered in posters was like directly based on you,
01:01:40 because I loved so much that you had all these different like, you know, specific topic poster corners.
01:01:47 Unfortunately, all my posters are anime, so there's no way to make it feel particularly like that.
01:01:53 But I did like, for instance, near my bed is like all like girls in swimsuits.
01:01:59 And then like on the wall behind my couch is all like really dignified looking posters, like, you know, cool action show type stuff like that looks all serious.
01:02:11 And then there's like one corner that's like just Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh and like childish stuff, which is supposed to be like, I haven't really used that one,
01:02:18 but it's supposed to be like the infantilism corner essentially.
01:02:20 That's the baby bro corner.
01:02:22 Yeah, well, because it was going to be where I was going to have a shelf of My Little Pony and a shelf of Pokemon,
01:02:27 but I can never bring myself to actually put the My Little Pony shelf together as I talked about in the Insomnia Analysis 2 video,
01:02:34 just because like I feel I have such like mixed and mostly negative feelings about like the pony experience that I just don't even want to think about it anymore.
01:02:44 But like, yeah, I totally copied your idea of spend all my money on posters, put them everywhere, and it'll make my sets look cooler.
01:02:55 Because personally, I think green screen sets are lame and they're also hard to use. You have to really like those things.
01:03:00 Yeah, if you do green screen badly, everybody can tell.
01:03:03 Right, and me and you both live in rooms that are like too big to light.
01:03:07 They're just black holes. They're fucking, all our videos look dark. There's no way around it.
01:03:14 Yeah, so, all right, I got to think of more questions for you.
01:03:22 So, all right, the channel that you've been saying that you want to put focus on the most is My Japanese Animes.
01:03:33 Yeah.
01:03:34 How did that channel happen? Like, where did it come from?
01:03:37 Oh, fuck. Okay, I believe the first My Japanese Animes was in January of 2015 and it was the Bleacher View.
01:03:46 I think the dandy videos were out before that though.
01:03:51 Yeah, but it was during that time of November 2014 to June 2015 when I was working on Horseshoe Finale.
01:04:02 And in the meantime, between Magical Mystery Cure and Horseshoe Finale, I couldn't very well make more pony videos because that would have fucking ruined it.
01:04:11 But I had to make money somehow, so I had to find ways to keep making videos while also making Horseshoe Finale and one of the ways was to make My Japanese Animes and just have an anime channel.
01:04:22 And it came out amazingly because the Bleach video was like fucking awesome. It was one of my favorite videos you ever did.
01:04:33 I love all of them and you seem to have a different mentality about that channel that every video has to be tight and complete.
01:04:42 My Japanese Animes is my YouTube channel. It's my best channel if you're looking for a YouTube channel because I don't really consider Endless Jess a YouTube channel at all.
01:04:56 Endless Jess is just my fucking clubhouse and you're there by special invitation and so you better obey the rules or I'll kick you out.
01:05:05 And Man Child Incorporated is another thing. I sort of have a different philosophy behind all of my channels and how I approach the content when I make them on there.
01:05:15 And that's why they're separate and what keeps them interesting because I take those gimmicks seriously.
01:05:22 It was kind of a reversal on the original intent because for a long time Drowning in Footwear was the main channel and it was supposed to be mostly big videos.
01:05:32 And then you would routinely hide the vlogs because you would do like a month with a bunch of vlogs and then you'd feel upset that they were on your main channel and then sort of hide them all.
01:05:44 But then at some point it was like a switch flip and you went fuck it Endless Jess is now the everything channel.
01:05:50 And the reason that I do that I get into these periods of just doing like weird vlogs on Endless Jess there is a philosophy behind it and there's a plan behind it.
01:05:59 I always know what I'm doing people. I'm always 10 steps ahead of you. I'm always 10 steps ahead of myself.
01:06:03 The reason is that Endless Jess has a problem and that problem is videos going viral.
01:06:10 I can't fucking stop it from happening. It happens when I least expect it to usually the worst possible videos that could possibly go viral are the ones that do like fuck updates
01:06:19 or Batman v Superman the best review. Those videos get the norm that video get it has a lot of views. It's got over 10,000 views.
01:06:28 And those videos get the normie views and normies see those videos and they flock to my channel and they subscribe expecting like YouTube content.
01:06:39 And then inevitably they don't understand what they're subscribed to and they leave asinine stupid comments that piss me off and they downvote my videos.
01:06:47 Because they're they just expect some kind of fucking YouTube channel of a guy screaming in front of a bookcase about movies every week and that's not what it's going to be.
01:06:55 So because I get so many normie subscribers that I don't fucking want who aren't going to get it who are just going to be a burden and a drain on my channel.
01:07:03 I routinely I'll go okay I'm going to make really really stupid videos for like three weeks straight and I'm going to shake off some of these subscribers.
01:07:13 And anyone who doesn't get it is going to unsubscribe and the people who stay subscribed are going to be the ones that I know get it.
01:07:19 And that's sort of how I cull the herd and keep things that you know I keep the normies out as best I can because otherwise they just infest it.
01:07:28 I mean if you look at fucking any big YouTuber who doesn't moderate their comment section which is another reason I moderate is because they all become a fucking sea of poison.
01:07:37 If you look at Anthony Fantano's comment section for example.
01:07:40 Holy shit and it's just memes people saying stupid shit and what that is it's the normie views those fucking normie subscribers.
01:07:49 If you don't keep them in check they will turn your entire channel into poison.
01:07:53 I think it's amazing that Fantano like ever reads or responds or has any opinions about his comments when they're as bad as they are.
01:08:04 Like I mean I get upset over bad comments but my comment sections are still by and large pretty good because everyone knows I read them.
01:08:11 And it's usually the people who are like you said it's the new people who don't get it and who leave like the shitty comments.
01:08:17 It blows my mind that you wouldn't moderate it because I view my videos sort of my videos on my art and the comments are on the video which means that the comments are a part of the art.
01:08:28 So if your comment is not worthy of being on my art then it's just going to be weighing it down for people.
01:08:34 You know when I fucking watch a YouTube video and I scroll down and I see shitty comments I like the video less it's annoying.
01:08:42 I don't usually read comments on other people's videos unless I'm really curious how people reacted to it but then like you said if it's like a Fantano video then it's incomprehensible fucking nonsense anyways.
01:08:57 It's always just like people asking for the next review of the other thing.
01:09:01 Like if I paint a painting and they hang my painting up in a museum and somebody stands in front of my painting and starts jacking off.
01:09:10 It's ruining the experience for everybody else who's trying to see the painting.
01:09:15 That's why he has to be tased by security and escorted off the premises.
01:09:21 Yeah I think we both pretty much agree on that.
01:09:23 We covered most of it in the commenter rules so I don't want to get too far down the comment hole but we both...
01:09:29 That's what it's called. It's not a comment section. It's a comment hole.
01:09:33 I think you and I both had this experience where we... I don't know if you thought this going in but I thought that doing commenter rules would help to put some of it behind me.
01:09:45 And instead it made me way angrier about comments.
01:09:49 It only made the fire stronger. It kindled that fire big time.
01:09:55 Yeah you were saying in the chat recently that you think us doing this podcast has made you an angrier and worse person.
01:10:02 And I feel like it's done the same thing to me because every time we bitch about people then I start thinking about that more and more.
01:10:11 Like the things that annoy us about people like I'll go out into the world and see it happening and be like ahhh.
01:10:18 You know didn't we just talk about this?
01:10:20 Well people would complain about the PCP podcast being clusterfuck and us all talking over each other and yelling over each other.
01:10:27 And my defense of that was well come on haven't you ever been at like a family Thanksgiving?
01:10:32 That's how we talk in my family and that was my defense of it but then I remembered oh wait I hate that about my family.
01:10:40 I've always hated that. Shit.
01:10:42 And now it's like I'm in Thanksgiving with my family every week with you fucking guys.
01:10:46 Every week I have to sit down and I have to steal myself for the onslaught the avalanche that's coming towards me.
01:10:53 Of everyone trying to get a word in edge wise and nobody succeeding at it.
01:10:57 And everything I say you know it creates this pressure and this stress on every idea that comes into your head.
01:11:03 Because everything you want to say you know that you have to say it forcefully and quickly or else you're not going to be able to finish it.
01:11:09 And that makes it ten times harder to articulate what you're trying to say.
01:11:12 So nobody is being able to say what they actually want to say and nobody is listening to what anyone else is saying.
01:11:17 So it just becomes a fucking a cesspool. It's like it's 4chan in audio form.
01:11:24 You know honestly I think it's all Nate's fault and I think we have to have an intervention about it.
01:11:28 Because like lately because I kept getting so much shit from people telling me that I was interrupting other people all the time.
01:11:35 That like eventually I started to reflect on it and like really be like okay maybe I interrupt people more than I realize.
01:11:43 Maybe it's a problem. So I've been trying to like really curb it back and not interrupt people.
01:11:48 But when you I realized this on like the sleep podcast because I really thought I wasn't going to have anything to say about that.
01:11:54 But the few times I did I realized that if Nate will always talk it doesn't matter if he has an idea.
01:12:02 It doesn't matter if he has something to say. He will talk.
01:12:05 Damn Digi I could almost kiss ya.
01:12:09 So if you don't get your ideas in there if you don't force them in Nate will talk.
01:12:15 And so you have to be forceful. You have to wedge it in and poor DeVue.
01:12:20 Like DeVue tries because in the early days he wouldn't get a word in because he wasn't cutting people off viciously enough.
01:12:28 But now he cuts people he cuts in so hard and it makes him hard.
01:12:34 Like it sounds like he's being way too serious and it just makes you like gloss over his point.
01:12:40 I think the whole thing is I think the whole it's an anger factory for all of us.
01:12:44 We're all just everybody always sounds completely pissed off by the end.
01:12:51 Like I'm never I am never as pissed off as I am immediately upon entering that podcast.
01:12:57 It's like it's like an aura to it. There's like an atmosphere that just gets into my skin.
01:13:04 Well the worst part is like because we tried after like with the Dark Souls one.
01:13:10 The idea was we were trying to scale back and do what more that were like three people.
01:13:15 And then the last two we did like Nate kept going like hey who else wants to be in and I'm like no.
01:13:23 Because it was not not the sleep one but the one before that where we had like six people in there and he like at messages you.
01:13:31 Hey Jesse want to be in the podcast. I'm like no he doesn't want to be in the podcast.
01:13:35 There's six fucking people in here. He's going to get pissed off and that's within minutes.
01:13:41 Jeff made you leave out of sheer rage.
01:13:48 That was that was by the way that was real. That was not like a skit that I had planned or anything.
01:13:53 No I literally like two minutes into the podcast.
01:13:57 Jeff made me so angry that I fucking got up and had to like storm around my kitchen for a while.
01:14:03 And then I just left the house and I just like I have to go to a walk.
01:14:06 I left the fucking recording on the podcast was still going on.
01:14:10 I just went outside and went for a walk and I went around the block and as I was coming back.
01:14:14 I see my secretary miss Jezameen Jezebel sitting there in her car and I'm like what are you doing here.
01:14:21 And she's like well I came to hang out and I'm like OK let's go back in the house so I can tell these guys I hate them and leave the podcast forever.
01:14:32 It was great because you sent me your audio recording and it's like two minutes of dialogue and then just this long like 30 minute silence.
01:14:42 And that was the whole recording of the first part and then like there was a separate recording for the Jezebel part.
01:14:47 But like you can I can hear you like when I listen back to it I can hear you leaving like all the audio of you leaving the house was in there.
01:14:55 It was fucking great.
01:14:59 Yeah I don't know it's it's weird for me because I have been talking to you for so long and I so approve of you and your art.
01:15:09 That you don't phase me with that kind of stuff anymore.
01:15:13 And I think there's a lot of people who legitimately can't handle that.
01:15:19 You know like do you remember when I had you on the pub crawl one time and you got into like this big fight with some of the other co-hosts.
01:15:29 One of one of them was being a huge gay lord.
01:15:32 I don't know which one Mr. Jeffrey Berger or whoever his name is.
01:15:36 Yeah you got into this fight with them and it got really legitimately awkward.
01:15:42 And like all I could think was like man I'm used to like Jesse's argument style which is that everyone else is wrong and that's all that matters.
01:15:54 You know like I think for you it always seems like proving yourself right comes later.
01:16:00 It's that I don't like being in arguments.
01:16:02 I hate arguing which means that when I get into an argument the fact that I'm in the argument makes me angry which makes the argument worse.
01:16:10 So it's a self-perpetuating cycle of rage that once I'm trapped in there's no getting out.
01:16:15 It's all or nothing.
01:16:16 We're going down in flames and I'm taking everyone with me.
01:16:20 See like I've put it to people like Jesse the Jesse Wood argument style is that you do know somewhere in your mind you know why you're mad and how to articulate it but that doesn't come out first.
01:16:35 What comes out first is no fuck you you're wrong.
01:16:39 I'm right.
01:16:40 And it takes about five minutes of that before you will then articulate it in a way that the other person like gets it.
01:16:47 And then they'll be like well why didn't you say that from the beginning and you're like I did say that just a simplified version of that because you didn't have the articulate version.
01:16:56 I hate about the Internet because I hate verbally sparring with people like right in real life.
01:17:01 I'm like kind of an incredibly violent person like I immediately like I have a line and everyone who crosses it I immediately want to fucking punch everybody.
01:17:13 Like if I'm standing in a store like if I like four teenagers so much as walk by me I instinctively my hands are in fist and I'm just waiting for them to fucking say something.
01:17:22 I know they're gonna fuck with me.
01:17:24 I'm gonna kill them all.
01:17:25 And then they keep walking and they don't do anything to me.
01:17:27 I'm like you sons of bitches you deliberately trying to make a fool out of me.
01:17:30 I see how it is.
01:17:32 I can't remember if you shared the whole straight out of Compton story on the podcast.
01:17:37 Did we tell it on the podcast before?
01:17:39 I don't know.
01:17:40 I don't know.
01:17:41 It seems like I've told that story a bunch but I don't know where I've told it.
01:17:44 Well you can't get enough of it if you want to tell it again.
01:17:47 It's fucking great.
01:17:49 We were seeing straight out of Compton me and my friends and there were these fucking teenagers sitting right behind us.
01:17:57 It's always teenagers.
01:17:59 Teenagers are human cancer.
01:18:01 They should not exist.
01:18:03 They should be put in prison until they're 25 all of them.
01:18:07 I was, you know, we're watching the movie and these fucking teenagers were talking during the entire fucking movie.
01:18:14 Making stupid jokes.
01:18:16 Not even making jokes.
01:18:17 Just talking.
01:18:18 Just fucking being teenagers.
01:18:19 And my friend asked them to shut up.
01:18:23 Or she asked them politely to stop talking.
01:18:25 Like two or three times throughout the movie and they wouldn't.
01:18:29 And then like eventually it gets to the part where like EZE is dying of AIDS.
01:18:34 And it's this emotional part of the movie and everybody's crying.
01:18:38 You know, it's like, it's the emotional crux of the movie.
01:18:41 And these fucking kids are back there and they're giggling and chuckling and laughing.
01:18:48 And I finally just, I turned around and I said shut the fuck up.
01:18:54 And like the whole theater kind of applauded and snickered.
01:18:58 And they shut up for a while.
01:19:02 And you know, everyone was, you know, all my friends were like, yeah, that was cool, yeah.
01:19:06 So we watched the rest of the movie in peace.
01:19:09 And I knew that it wasn't over.
01:19:11 Like I had a feeling in my gut because I've gotten myself into these situations many times in my life.
01:19:17 And I know when it's not over.
01:19:19 So the credits are rolling and everyone's filing out of the movie theater.
01:19:24 And I know these kids are gonna fucking kick my seat.
01:19:27 Or they're gonna try to start something.
01:19:30 And when they do, it's gonna be the last mistake they ever fucking make.
01:19:35 And so I'm sitting there and I'm waiting for them to do something.
01:19:39 And I'm sure that they didn't realize that I was waiting for them to do something.
01:19:43 They thought they could get the drop on me, but they don't know who I am.
01:19:48 So I'm sitting there, fists balled up.
01:19:52 I'm fucking, I'm as intense as a fucking cocaine-addled macho man promo.
01:19:58 I'm ready to fucking ignite at any minute.
01:20:02 And it fucking happens.
01:20:04 This kid dumps his entire popcorn bucket on my head
01:20:08 and thinks that he can get up fast enough and get out fast enough.
01:20:12 And I shot up like fucking lightning.
01:20:16 As soon as I felt that shit going over my head, I fucking shot up
01:20:21 and I fucking leaped over the seats and I grabbed him
01:20:25 and I fucking punched him right in his fucking temple.
01:20:29 I hope I did permanent damage. I hope he's dead.
01:20:32 I have no fucking remorse for this whatsoever.
01:20:35 I fucking punched him right in the skull like two or three times.
01:20:39 And he fucking, he kept trying to go and I was fucking chasing him out to like where the stairs were.
01:20:45 And I fucking, the last punch that I landed on him, I punched him in the head so hard
01:20:51 that my fist sent his head flying into the wall of the staircase.
01:20:56 So like I punched him and it bounced off the wall.
01:20:59 It was like, it was like two hits for one.
01:21:01 It was like a fucking, like a pinball machine.
01:21:03 And he's fucking, he's fucking running around.
01:21:08 Oh my, everyone's screaming.
01:21:10 The whole fucking theater is watching this.
01:21:12 And by the way, the whole time that this is happening, it's the credits.
01:21:15 So straight out of Compton, the song is playing.
01:21:17 Fucking NWA is blasting.
01:21:19 It's the soundtrack to me beating the shit out of this teenager.
01:21:23 And he's fucking running.
01:21:26 And then his fucking fat, lard ass girlfriend is like, what the fuck are you doing?
01:21:32 He's only 13 years old.
01:21:35 And I fucking got right in your face and I'm like, I'll fucking hit you too, you fat bitch.
01:21:40 Get out of my face. Get out of my theater.
01:21:43 And they fucking go.
01:21:45 And then, so they run out of the theater and I calmly, I fucking like straighten my shirt
01:21:50 and I walk back to my friends and I just say, we should probably go right now.
01:21:55 We should probably go out the, out the side exit.
01:21:58 We should, we should get in our cars now.
01:22:01 We just fucking left.
01:22:02 And it was, it was a proud moment.
01:22:06 It was a great moment.
01:22:08 I have no regrets and no remorse.
01:22:10 I hope he, I hope that fucking kid, I hope he hasn't had a decent night's sleep since.
01:22:14 I hope it, I hope my face haunts his every nightmare.
01:22:18 I hope he went to school with a bunch of, with like eight black eyes all over his face.
01:22:24 And I hope all the other kids, I hope word got around his school of what happened
01:22:28 and he's getting made fun of to this day for it.
01:22:30 Fuck him.
01:22:31 I hope he killed himself.
01:22:33 You know, I love that story, but there's only, there's one detail I just realized is weird.
01:22:38 Why did he still have so much popcorn left?
01:22:41 Like who finishes a movie and hasn't finished their popcorn?
01:22:45 Some, some faggot, some teenager.
01:22:48 No fucking skinny ass tiny stomach, can't fucking fit his popcorn.
01:22:52 You'd think his, you'd think his lard ass girlfriend would have, would have finished it off for him.
01:22:59 But I guess she was too busy fucking, sucking strange dick in the bathroom.
01:23:05 I don't know.
01:23:06 She was too full of cum.
01:23:08 Yeah.
01:23:09 I, I think I want to address to the audience that like, I think more than any of the other members of the, the PCP at least,
01:23:21 you have probably the biggest like, how do I put this?
01:23:26 Like on and off camera, like is pretty different.
01:23:31 Like even though you, you definitely like a, you know, not to say that anything you're doing on camera is like not real or not really what you're like,
01:23:39 but like, you're much more in your own head and quiet and like, um, like when I hang out with you, you're not constantly ranting like, like you're on camera.
01:23:52 It's more like concentrated bursts of when you have an idea to rant about.
01:23:58 Whereas hanging out with me in real life is legitimately, I never shut the fuck up.
01:24:02 It's exactly like it is on camera.
01:24:04 Do you feel that there's like a big difference to you between like on and off when you're a,
01:24:09 I'm definitely, I'm definitely quieter off camera or more, um, pensive, I guess, or aloof.
01:24:17 I don't know.
01:24:19 I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm so on when I'm on camera that I've become even more, you know, decompressing when I'm off camera.
01:24:28 Because I value, I value being off camera because it's to me, it's important.
01:24:35 I don't know if that makes sense.
01:24:37 Well, I know you, you like to have like a private life.
01:24:41 That's not the, like, like for me, there's very little that I don't talk about on like Digi Bros. or in my vlogs.
01:24:49 You know, like, it's almost like every emotion I have.
01:24:52 Although I don't talk as much about like my stresses or negative emotions because I just think it would be kind of annoying.
01:24:59 But like, I think you have a lot more value in doing something that nobody hears about and is just something you got to do.
01:25:07 Um, would you say so?
01:25:11 Yeah, I, uh, and lately, like, I make an effort.
01:25:15 I have to kind of force myself to do things without recording it at this point because it's become such a habit of if I play a video game,
01:25:23 I should be recording it in case I say something funny.
01:25:26 If I have a thought that I should film a vlog or I should be, I should be creating something right now.
01:25:32 I should be making a rap song or something.
01:25:34 So I kind of have to force myself to just shut out the world and make myself not be turned on or not be in fucking entertainment mode
01:25:44 and just enjoy myself by myself or like hang out with friends.
01:25:47 I never hang out with friends not because I don't want to, just because I'm always focused on creating stuff
01:25:52 and I don't think to call anybody or hang out with anybody.
01:25:56 Yeah, I have the same problem.
01:25:58 That's why I was saying, like, uh, that I need a hobby on Twitter the other day because I'm like, I,
01:26:04 everything I do is either, like, in service of making a video or it is a video, you know,
01:26:10 with the exception of, like, going out to eat and stuff like that.
01:26:13 And it's like, I need something to do that's not immediately relevant to that.
01:26:19 But I don't have it.
01:26:20 It's weird because, um, in my, uh, in my videos, there's like a difference in anger in my videos
01:26:28 because in my videos, it seems like I mostly get mad at stuff, at things, like computers or whatever.
01:26:35 In real life, I mostly get mad at people and, you know, just random, you know, bad luck doesn't really bother me.
01:26:43 If I'm, like, I'll be in situations where, like, there's a flat tire or everyone's stranded somewhere.
01:26:49 Like, some horrible disaster happens and we're stuck in the rain and everyone else is always freaking out.
01:26:54 And that stuff never phases me. Like, I'm totally aloof. I'm always making jokes because, to me, that's just a story.
01:26:59 Everything that happens to me is some funny anecdote that I can talk about later.
01:27:03 And so, I'm not bothered by stuff that happens.
01:27:06 But when it comes to people, um, I'm always kind of on edge.
01:27:11 I'm always paranoid because I just, I guess it's the way that I grew up.
01:27:16 I'm always, um, I'm just used to getting fucked with and used to having to fight and used to fucking, so...
01:27:24 I know you've had a lot of, like, for whatever reason, the police don't like you.
01:27:29 Oh, yeah. Well, I grew up in a fucking, a very hodunk, white trash, very small town.
01:27:37 And the thing about small towns is the cops are fucking bored.
01:27:40 And when the cops are bored, they fuck with everyone.
01:27:44 And they especially fuck on poor kids who don't look the way that they think kids should look.
01:27:49 Yeah.
01:27:50 And, uh, so, I was always getting fucked with.
01:27:53 You were always, like, long-haired, uh...
01:27:55 Yeah.
01:27:56 Like, surfer slash pirate guy.
01:27:59 Yeah, I always had long hair. I always had a leather jacket on.
01:28:02 So the cops just, like, pull you over and, like, hassle you for no fucking reason?
01:28:06 Yeah. They always thought that I was fucking stealing something.
01:28:09 They always thought that I was, you know, up to no good.
01:28:12 They always thought that I had drugs on me.
01:28:14 They always thought that I was a fucking stoner.
01:28:16 Even though I didn't look like a stoner, that's the thing that bothers me.
01:28:18 Nobody knows what a stoner looks like or sounds like.
01:28:21 Because they would look at me, oh, long hair, leather jacket, that kid's on drugs.
01:28:25 I never touched a fucking drug in my life.
01:28:27 The kids who were smoking weed were the fucking skinny kids in the tank tops and the beanie hats
01:28:33 walking around doing this.
01:28:35 Yeah.
01:28:37 That's their fucking mating call.
01:28:39 That's what they all sound like.
01:28:41 Yeah, to clarify for the audience, um,
01:28:45 you have not, until very recently,
01:28:49 have never been high in a video because you hate weed.
01:28:53 I hate weed probably.
01:28:57 I say this about everything, but it's definitely up there among the things I hate most in the fucking world.
01:29:02 I can't stand it. I can't stand the smell of it.
01:29:05 I can't stand other people smoking it around me.
01:29:08 It just brings my fucking piss to a boil.
01:29:12 Generally not a drug guy at all.
01:29:14 Yeah, something about it. I have like this vast psychological aversion, this hatred of marijuana.
01:29:22 Yeah.
01:29:23 But you do drink, but not as much as people think probably.
01:29:27 Yeah.
01:29:28 Oh, yeah, finish that story.
01:29:30 Yeah, recently I got very, very high for the first time in my life, not from smoking anything,
01:29:36 but because my secretary, Jezameen Jezebel,
01:29:42 she was like, hey, look what I got.
01:29:45 This is pot candy.
01:29:47 This is a nerd rope, but there's marijuana in it.
01:29:50 It doesn't make you really high.
01:29:51 And I'm like, no, it won't.
01:29:53 Shut up.
01:29:54 And I ate it.
01:29:55 And she's like, I'm warning you.
01:29:57 I'm warning you.
01:29:58 Only eat half of it.
01:29:59 And I ate the whole thing.
01:30:01 I'm like, shut up.
01:30:02 I'll eat the whole thing.
01:30:03 I don't care.
01:30:04 I'm strong.
01:30:08 And yeah, so I ate the whole thing.
01:30:13 And then I started time traveling.
01:30:16 Yeah.
01:30:17 Then I became the fucking master of the universe.
01:30:24 I don't know.
01:30:26 I was just sitting there.
01:30:27 I listened to a few albums whilst time traveling.
01:30:31 I fucking surfed through the galaxies.
01:30:33 The channel art for Endless Jez became my actual life in that moment.
01:30:37 It was me surfing the cosmos on an electric guitar.
01:30:41 And then I got on fucking online and started just completely seducing women.
01:30:48 Like my fucking powers were out of control that night.
01:30:52 My powers of seduction.
01:30:54 It was cool.
01:30:56 It was cool.
01:30:57 By which I mean it was terrifying and never ever again.
01:31:00 Yeah.
01:31:01 That's exactly because I got high for the first time on Christmas and it was a waking
01:31:06 nightmare.
01:31:07 I jacked off six times.
01:31:08 Yeah.
01:31:09 Me too.
01:31:10 What the fuck?
01:31:12 I actually had to go to bed just because my dick hurt from jacking off.
01:31:16 Yeah.
01:31:17 My winner was sore for like three days.
01:31:18 I was like, what is this doing to me?
01:31:23 I just assumed because it hurt the next day and I was like, Jesus, I guess because I had
01:31:28 no self-control because I was too high to know how to use my body.
01:31:31 I guess because of the time travel that was going on, my hand was connected to the speed
01:31:36 force.
01:31:37 Bury down with electricity shooting out of it, burning like fucking, burning through dimensions.
01:31:43 I had my own flash point.
01:31:47 I fucking, I erased people from existence and changed the very fabric of reality.
01:31:54 By coming on them.
01:31:57 Yeah.
01:31:58 Oh, Jesus Christ.
01:32:01 It's all right.
01:32:03 My cock became a Gurren Lagondrill.
01:32:06 I don't remember if I was going to go anywhere else with that.
01:32:10 So all right.
01:32:11 I want you to, you turned 26 this year, right?
01:32:16 Yeah.
01:32:17 Yeah.
01:32:18 Last year, last July, it's coming up.
01:32:22 Okay.
01:32:23 So your birthday is about to happen.
01:32:25 I'm going to be 27 in about a month.
01:32:28 You sound very upset about it.
01:32:30 I am very fucking upset about it.
01:32:33 It's the most upsetting thing in the world.
01:32:35 We're going to die, Digi.
01:32:36 We're all going to die.
01:32:37 There's nothing after you realize that.
01:32:39 Can you imagine non-existence?
01:32:41 No, you can't imagine it and we're getting closer to it every second.
01:32:44 Well, Jesse, thankfully I have religion and my religion is the singularity where I get
01:32:51 my brain inside a computer.
01:32:52 That's my religion.
01:32:53 It's what keeps me going.
01:32:57 My only goal in life is to live longer than the people younger than me.
01:33:01 Yeah, that's a good goal.
01:33:05 So you're the second oldest member of the PCP.
01:33:08 I think Tom's the second oldest.
01:33:10 I think Tom's the oldest.
01:33:12 He might be already 27.
01:33:16 But anyway, I want to get a picture because obviously you haven't been doing YouTube ever
01:33:21 since whatever you were doing before it.
01:33:23 You graduated high school.
01:33:25 Yeah.
01:33:26 And you went to college for a while.
01:33:29 What were you doing in college?
01:33:31 I don't know what I was doing in college and I didn't know what I was doing there when
01:33:34 I was there.
01:33:35 That's why I eventually stopped going.
01:33:37 How long did you go for?
01:33:39 I think I went for four or five years?
01:33:43 Long time.
01:33:44 Oh my God.
01:33:45 Yeah.
01:33:46 Was it like community college?
01:33:47 It was a community college.
01:33:48 I majored in everything.
01:33:51 I got a degree in nothing.
01:33:54 That's how mine went.
01:33:57 I understand.
01:33:59 I think around 2012, I dropped out of that school and I started going to Spex Howard,
01:34:05 which is like a video editing school.
01:34:07 I went there for one semester and I really liked it there.
01:34:10 I would have completed that course except that it was like an hour and a half drive away
01:34:15 from my house twice a week.
01:34:17 Eventually I had enough of that shit so I stopped going to that too.
01:34:23 Luckily around that time, I was starting, I guess the next year I started drawing horseshoes
01:34:30 and started making Patreon money so I didn't have to fucking.
01:34:33 In the meantime, I worked like crappy jobs.
01:34:35 I worked at a cyber cafe at nights and stuff and I did farm work all the way through high
01:34:42 school.
01:34:43 Ben mentioned that in the last podcast because I was trying to figure, I was trying to remember
01:34:46 what everybody else did for jobs.
01:34:48 You said through high school you did farm work?
01:34:50 Through high school and right up until like I was about 23, I guess, I was doing, I worked
01:34:57 on a farm that was run by my friend's mom, a fucking sheep farm and a fucking, yeah,
01:35:04 it was terrible.
01:35:05 It sucked.
01:35:06 What did you do on a farm in all that time?
01:35:08 Oh god, everything.
01:35:09 Like a lot of like bailing hay, stacking it in big piles and moving it around, barns and
01:35:14 shit, which is fucking grueling and horrible and no one should ever do it.
01:35:18 Why did they let you do that in high school?
01:35:21 Oh yeah.
01:35:22 It's gotta be some, was this like under the table work I'm taking it?
01:35:26 Yeah, we were all paid in cash.
01:35:27 I mean, it wasn't like a, we sort of fell into it because like it was my friend's house.
01:35:32 Let's go hang out with my friend.
01:35:34 Oh, by the way, while you kids are here, these sheep need to be herded and shorn and this
01:35:38 hay needs to be stacked and eventually somehow that turned into an actual job and like,
01:35:44 okay, you're all my workers now and fucking, yeah, so that became like a job and we all
01:35:51 fucking lived there.
01:35:52 It was like a sort of a second home.
01:35:54 Like for a while, like I had two homes.
01:35:57 Like there's like my house house and my friend's house and I would just travel between them
01:36:01 down the road and it was cool.
01:36:03 It was kind of like living on like a hippie commune with my friends and like I look back
01:36:07 on those days with a lot of fondness just because like it's in the past and you were
01:36:12 just me and you were a child and everything was good.
01:36:14 I definitely would not say that I was happy.
01:36:17 Okay.
01:36:18 I was, there were some times that I was pretty miserable, but like just the fact that I was
01:36:24 miserable with my friends and that we were always together and they were always around
01:36:28 me is something that I don't have anymore because now I live a very solitary existence
01:36:33 and by choice, I hate people.
01:36:35 I'm completely misanthropic.
01:36:36 I never want to be around anyone, but I also can look fondly on being around everyone.
01:36:40 If you were around them enough, you would get completely sick of them.
01:36:43 Yeah.
01:36:44 I know for a fact.
01:36:48 So that's where a lot of my oldest inside jokes came from is that time that I still use
01:36:55 on my channels like the Donatello thing.
01:37:00 Right.
01:37:01 Donatello was, I wanted to ask about that because you have all these characters who like recur
01:37:06 all the time.
01:37:07 Oh, they're not just characters.
01:37:09 There's a lore.
01:37:10 We have an entire backstory.
01:37:12 There's an entire universe of this shit that we have been creating since like the first
01:37:19 years of high school because we started doing fucking Vegeta impressions and then we started
01:37:24 doing Goofy and then we started doing Donatello and then we started doing Dingo, which is
01:37:29 such an obscure character.
01:37:31 He's from Disney's Gargoyles.
01:37:32 He's the Australian member of the pack with the Mohawk.
01:37:34 Nobody fucking remembers Dingo, but we did Dingo.
01:37:36 Dingo was one of our guys.
01:37:37 He has a dome.
01:37:38 He has many wives.
01:37:39 He's a polygamist.
01:37:40 And you know, Goofy has dinner parties every week.
01:37:45 All the friends go there.
01:37:46 Godzilla's there.
01:37:47 Shaggy's there.
01:37:48 Scooby's there.
01:37:49 Everyone.
01:37:50 The whole gang and Mickey's there.
01:37:51 Nobody really likes Mickey, but he shows up uninvited.
01:37:52 You know, Donald's there.
01:37:53 Everybody's afraid of Donald because Donald has the worst temper.
01:37:55 You know, he really beats people up.
01:37:56 And for the longest time, Goofy and Vegeta were mortal enemies.
01:38:00 They were bitter rivals.
01:38:01 They were always locked in mortal combat because they were the most powerful guys.
01:38:04 Nobody's stronger than Goofy when he gets angry, but Vegeta's super strong too.
01:38:07 You know, he's a super saint.
01:38:08 So Goofy and Vegeta, they would lock horns all the time.
01:38:10 They would have these great epic battles all across the country, but eventually they became
01:38:14 the best of friends.
01:38:16 It was like fucking Dharmak and Jalad at Tanagra.
01:38:18 It was like fucking Gilgamesh and then Ketu.
01:38:22 They became like brothers.
01:38:24 And to this day, they're the best of friends.
01:38:26 But then fucking Donald shows up.
01:38:27 Donald is a fucking loose cannon.
01:38:29 He's out of control.
01:38:30 He has the worst temper of all.
01:38:31 And he's so fucking powerful.
01:38:32 He kicks everybody's ass.
01:38:34 So Goofy and Vegeta are constantly afraid of Donald.
01:38:37 And you know, sometimes, you know, Donald has the secret stash of 80s drugs.
01:38:41 And one time, Goofy and Vegeta, they raided his closet.
01:38:46 Donald doesn't know about this.
01:38:47 I hope he doesn't listen to this podcast.
01:38:48 He's really mad.
01:38:49 But they got into the closet.
01:38:50 They raided his stash of 80s drugs.
01:38:52 Vegeta and Goofy got on the 80s drugs.
01:38:54 That was a whole fucking thing.
01:38:56 And you know, they had such a fucking wild adventure.
01:38:59 That's why Dingo stays out of it a lot of time.
01:39:01 You know, Dingo stays in his dome now because he's kind of over the hill.
01:39:03 He can't handle the wild partying ways of Goofy and Vegeta when they're on those damn 80s drugs.
01:39:08 They go fucking crazy.
01:39:09 And then Donald tells us just a fucking psychotic asshole.
01:39:12 He's the worst guy ever.
01:39:15 What fascinates me is that you've been writing these characters into your videos all this time.
01:39:21 And no one knows why.
01:39:25 And not even in a way where I think people are questioning it.
01:39:30 Like they probably just don't even realize there's anything to that.
01:39:34 You know, like Man Child Marsh had like almost all these guys in it.
01:39:38 And they talk like they do in your story.
01:39:43 And that's why in Horseshoe Finale, when I'm doing the CM Punk part,
01:39:48 that part where CM Punk turns to the camera and goes,
01:39:51 Hi Colt Cabana, how you doing?
01:39:54 I did that part and the original line was going to be,
01:39:56 Hi Colt Corona, how you doing?
01:39:58 That's essentially why Colt Corona was created.
01:40:01 But at the last minute when I was making Horseshoe Finale,
01:40:04 I realized it would make more sense because of what the video became to me,
01:40:08 that I should go back even farther.
01:40:10 So the line became, Hi Vegeta, how you doing?
01:40:13 Because Vegeta was the first.
01:40:14 He was like the first character that set me down this wacky path of creativity, I guess.
01:40:20 So that was a little nod to that.
01:40:22 Yeah, it's interesting.
01:40:23 I feel like I wonder if anybody has ever questioned,
01:40:27 because you do these impersonations of the characters,
01:40:29 but again, they're not based on the characters from the shows.
01:40:33 They're based on your interpretations of them from this story.
01:40:37 So Vegeta in a Jesse video is not Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z.
01:40:42 Well, it's weird because when it started,
01:40:45 it was sort of just a straight impersonation.
01:40:48 And it was like in character as a TV show,
01:40:50 but over time he stopped being,
01:40:52 he became so much of like my thing,
01:40:55 that there was like character development that went on.
01:40:57 And he became the Vegeta that we now know,
01:41:00 who's like sort of a lazy, underachieving,
01:41:03 kind of fucking surfer bro who doesn't give a shit about anything.
01:41:08 Donna Tello is my favorite though.
01:41:11 And you originally did have,
01:41:14 I'm mad that this video is not up anymore,
01:41:17 unless it was taken down the one with just how Donna Tello is insane.
01:41:21 Like, you had collected all the scenes of Donna Tello
01:41:25 and all the Turtles movies,
01:41:27 and it was just a video of him being fucking insane.
01:41:30 And like, I think that video,
01:41:33 I never thought, I never realized how crazy Donna Tello was.
01:41:37 Where I started doing Donna Tello was when James Rolfe did
01:41:42 his Angry Video Game Nerd video on Turtles 3, the movie,
01:41:45 because it's the stupidest of the trilogy.
01:41:48 He kept pointing out all of these scenes that are like,
01:41:51 this is the dumbest line ever in a movie.
01:41:53 This is so stupid.
01:41:54 But the thing that he was missing,
01:41:56 that I realized, all of those scenes were Donna Tello.
01:41:59 All of those dumb lines were him.
01:42:02 And so then I watched,
01:42:04 I started watching all the movies back to back,
01:42:06 and I watched the third one, and I realized,
01:42:08 because the original Turtles movies,
01:42:12 Donna Tello is a smart one.
01:42:14 He's the guy who does machines in the cartoon.
01:42:16 But the movies didn't really have a place for that
01:42:19 in the narrative.
01:42:20 They didn't have a lot of him doing computer stuff
01:42:22 or working on machines.
01:42:23 For a while in the first movie,
01:42:25 he works on a truck with Casey, but that's about it.
01:42:27 He doesn't really do machines in the movies.
01:42:29 So I guess how they compensated for that
01:42:31 was to just make him the oddball of the group
01:42:33 and make him so fucking weird.
01:42:36 And everything that Donna Tello says in those movies
01:42:38 is the most insane thing you've ever heard
01:42:41 in your fucking life.
01:42:42 Yeah.
01:42:43 It's like,
01:42:44 I think I swallowed a frog.
01:42:45 I hope it wasn't an ancestor.
01:42:50 I love stuff.
01:42:53 It's a legarama shooing.
01:42:57 Someone in our comments has caught on
01:43:00 that I love stuff is a meme among the procrastinators.
01:43:03 And that's entirely just because
01:43:05 of your Donna Tello impressions.
01:43:07 Because we met at BronyCon
01:43:09 and we were all doing, like, me and you kept going.
01:43:12 The best one is, yeah.
01:43:15 Yeah!
01:43:17 Which is just, that is a Donna Tello line.
01:43:19 Yeah, that's not a Tello.
01:43:20 It's from the second movie,
01:43:21 which was the only movie where he was not voiced
01:43:23 by Corey Feldman,
01:43:24 which is why he sounds different in the second movie.
01:43:26 This is some very important turtle's trivia.
01:43:28 Corey Feldman only played Donna Tello
01:43:29 in the first and third movie.
01:43:30 In the second movie, he was played by a different guy.
01:43:32 So while he sounds different,
01:43:33 he is still the same interpretation of the character.
01:43:36 He is still insane.
01:43:38 Yeah! Yeah!
01:43:40 He's in like a toy store
01:43:42 and there's like this giant, like,
01:43:44 one of those dolls that just like
01:43:46 goes back and forth and he like pushes it
01:43:49 and it goes back and he catches it
01:43:51 and then he pushes it again and he's like,
01:43:53 Yeah! Yeah!
01:43:56 And then he gets the idea to become that guy
01:43:59 and he like, he starts leaning back and forth
01:44:02 to like disguise himself as that inflatable guy
01:44:04 and it totally fools the foot ninja
01:44:06 and he starts fucking with him and beating him up.
01:44:08 It's hilarious.
01:44:09 Like the best thing that we ever did,
01:44:11 like what really cemented Donna Tello
01:44:14 as like a part of my fucking haul of heroes
01:44:18 was when I was way back in the fucking commune farm
01:44:22 where I used to fucking live and work with all my friends,
01:44:24 whenever we weren't working,
01:44:26 we were in the basement playing video games
01:44:27 and hanging out and stuff
01:44:28 and we had like three TVs in the basement.
01:44:30 We would all play like Gears of War
01:44:32 or Halo System Link or whatever
01:44:34 and one time, me and my friend Dylan,
01:44:37 we had all three Turtles movies.
01:44:39 We had three DVD players.
01:44:41 We had three TVs.
01:44:43 So I wonder what happens if we turn on
01:44:45 all three Turtles movies at once
01:44:47 and just sit in the middle and absorb it
01:44:50 and we played all three movies at once
01:44:53 and we fucking laid there on the futon together as lovers
01:44:56 in the middle of these three TVs
01:44:58 absorbing this triforce of power
01:45:01 and the fucking love of the Turtles
01:45:05 and Donna Tello was like going into us
01:45:08 and we laid there for the entire duration of the movies
01:45:12 for the whole things just like
01:45:14 vegging out to this insane cacophony of Turtles.
01:45:18 I'm glad that's caught on now.
01:45:20 Vegging out, I love it.
01:45:22 And there were like moments when like
01:45:24 one of my other friends who was so outside of work
01:45:26 and like he walked in the room like
01:45:28 hey guys, do you have a...
01:45:30 What the fuck?
01:45:32 Like he was laying there in the middle
01:45:34 of like the three Turtles movies
01:45:36 and just fucking closed the door
01:45:38 and walked out and just fucking
01:45:40 he just left.
01:45:43 And that was one of the greatest moments of my life.
01:45:46 Oh, that's great.
01:45:48 That might be where I got my powers from.
01:45:54 Alright, so to move ahead a bit from that
01:45:57 again I feel like there's a lot of stuff in your videos
01:46:01 that because I've known you for so long
01:46:04 I get and I feel like no one else can
01:46:07 get because they haven't been.
01:46:10 And that's one of them because we...
01:46:14 the procrastinators have kind of adopted those memes
01:46:17 because...
01:46:19 What happened? What's going on?
01:46:21 What do you mean?
01:46:23 I'm in a void.
01:46:25 Can you hear me?
01:46:27 You cut out for like 30 seconds there, buddy.
01:46:29 That was scary. I thought that was the end of the world.
01:46:31 Oh, Jesus.
01:46:33 Did it just happen again?
01:46:35 It keeps happening.
01:46:37 This is madness.
01:46:39 What's going on?
01:46:43 What is my life?
01:46:45 Am I here now?
01:46:47 I don't know what happened. It just disconnected for no reason.
01:46:52 What? Am I here?
01:46:54 Holy shit.
01:46:56 Alright, so anyway, I was saying...
01:46:59 I can't tell if you're really here or not.
01:47:01 Can you hear me right now?
01:47:03 You're not here.
01:47:04 Oh my fucking god.
01:47:06 What is happening?
01:47:08 What is this nightmare?
01:47:15 Oh my god.
01:47:16 Help!
01:47:18 Alright, uh...
01:47:20 Jesse.
01:47:22 Jesse?
01:47:24 I broke discord again.
01:47:26 Sorry, guys.
01:47:30 I was messing around with the triotubes.
01:47:32 And I broke the audio transistor.
01:47:36 Yes.
01:47:38 I love podcasts.
01:47:40 Hey!
01:47:42 I was saying how...
01:47:44 like, we...
01:47:46 the other PCP members,
01:47:48 we all, like, found out
01:47:50 about this whole lore
01:47:52 of all these characters.
01:47:54 And so we're all in on the joke now, too.
01:47:56 So that's why it's so surreal to me
01:47:58 when I see something like Man Child Marsh
01:48:00 and I'm like, no one gets this, but us!
01:48:02 You know, like, yeah.
01:48:04 I don't know.
01:48:06 I don't know.
01:48:08 And another one is
01:48:10 to sort of seg you into...
01:48:12 or segue, if you want,
01:48:14 into talking about more of your history
01:48:16 of how you
01:48:18 got started on YouTube.
01:48:20 You originated from
01:48:22 that guy with the glasses forums, right?
01:48:24 Oh, yeah.
01:48:26 I had almost blacked that out of my memory.
01:48:28 So what got you into that
01:48:30 and how and where did it go?
01:48:32 Um, it was just...
01:48:34 it was just...
01:48:36 when I started making videos,
01:48:38 that was what was
01:48:40 the popular thing.
01:48:42 That was kind of, like,
01:48:44 considered, I guess, the big boys' club.
01:48:46 Um, so...
01:48:48 I started hanging out in that forum
01:48:50 because that forum had, like,
01:48:52 a Your Video Review section
01:48:54 where people would post their stuff.
01:48:56 And, um,
01:48:58 no real effect to it
01:49:00 because it was just people posting
01:49:02 their own shit and, you know,
01:49:04 the only people who ever watched your stuff
01:49:06 were the same fucking people who hung out on the forums
01:49:08 all the time, so it was pretty worthless.
01:49:10 And, um, if you can imagine
01:49:12 the kind of
01:49:14 content creators who would hang out
01:49:16 on those forums, imagine
01:49:18 that guy with the glasses,
01:49:20 but worse, somehow more
01:49:22 amateur than that guy with the glasses.
01:49:24 Right.
01:49:26 Because it was, like, in those days,
01:49:28 there was no, like,
01:49:30 there was nothing to compare to.
01:49:32 You realize just how amateur everyone is
01:49:34 on that fucking website.
01:49:36 Like, even the big names, they're fucking terrible
01:49:38 video makers, and they haven't evolved.
01:49:40 They're still making the same trash
01:49:42 they were five fucking years ago,
01:49:44 and the people on the forum
01:49:46 were, like, the fanboys of that,
01:49:48 so they were even fucking worse.
01:49:50 And there were only a few diamonds in the rough,
01:49:52 and you pretty much,
01:49:54 Digi, you know all of them
01:49:56 because there were the friends
01:49:58 that I made on there. It was
01:50:00 Digi, and, uh, Johnny Old School,
01:50:02 who isn't really a YouTube person anymore,
01:50:04 but he was a pretty good one back in the day.
01:50:06 Um, we became friends really quick,
01:50:08 and, uh, the Cinemacicist,
01:50:10 we became good friends, I really liked his videos,
01:50:12 I still really do, he's got a great channel,
01:50:14 and, um, Aiden from the
01:50:16 Examined Life of Gaming.
01:50:18 And we were, like, we were the horseshoe crew
01:50:20 of those forums, and we were the best guys,
01:50:22 we were the only people on there
01:50:24 worth a damn, we hated everybody else,
01:50:26 so much so that eventually I just stopped
01:50:28 going there entirely, and also when I
01:50:30 fell out of love with the whole concept of whatever
01:50:32 that site does. So fuck it.
01:50:34 Yeah. So, like,
01:50:36 what, what era,
01:50:38 uh, like,
01:50:40 the last video you would have posted
01:50:42 to the forums, what do you think it would have been?
01:50:44 Like, when are we looking at for the time frame of this?
01:50:46 I think, uh,
01:50:48 it would be around,
01:50:50 I'm pretty sure you just cut out again,
01:50:52 but I'm gonna keep talking as though you haven't.
01:50:54 I think it was around,
01:50:56 oh god damn it, this annoys me, this is freaking me out.
01:50:58 I think, I think I'm here.
01:51:00 Oh, there you are.
01:51:02 I don't think I said anything else after you,
01:51:04 when you said that. Well, I could, god damn it,
01:51:06 I feel like it keeps, I can, I can tell
01:51:08 when it's like the dead air where nothing
01:51:10 is being recorded. Are you sure?
01:51:12 Okay, now you're back.
01:51:14 Go ahead
01:51:16 and continue. Okay, um,
01:51:18 I don't know, I think the last video that I really
01:51:20 remember posting there, it might have been
01:51:22 Altered Beast, I think that was in
01:51:24 like 2013 or, was it,
01:51:26 I don't even fucking, so that'd be pretty early.
01:51:28 Yeah, I did that in like the Silent Hill Downpour
01:51:30 review, I know that I posted there,
01:51:32 and that was in 2012.
01:51:34 So,
01:51:36 so yeah, so you, you were only there
01:51:38 for, not
01:51:40 too long, but you made those friends
01:51:42 and then, all of them,
01:51:44 I am assuming left as well.
01:51:46 Yeah, I got everything
01:51:48 decent out of there that I could,
01:51:50 which was the few friends that I made there
01:51:52 and then we took our talent elsewhere.
01:51:54 And I'd say the, at the time
01:51:56 the most successful out of all of you was
01:51:58 Johnny Old School, right? Yeah,
01:52:00 because he had his site and he had ads up on
01:52:02 Spoonie's site, and he got a lot of traffic
01:52:04 on his site. He didn't get a lot of
01:52:06 subscribers or repeat traffic, I don't
01:52:08 think, but he,
01:52:10 I remember him saying once that he did get checks
01:52:12 from AdSense on his site, so he must have been getting traffic.
01:52:14 Great.
01:52:16 And he eventually sort of retired
01:52:18 from YouTube, right? Yeah, he, uh,
01:52:20 he, uh, started,
01:52:22 he moved around a lot,
01:52:24 he became a chef, he, uh,
01:52:26 started going to art school, and he had this
01:52:28 like, uh, this big, like
01:52:30 philosophical, this
01:52:32 burst of hippie, artistic,
01:52:34 personal growth.
01:52:36 And he became, like, very, like,
01:52:38 super
01:52:40 one with the earth. We all need to join hands
01:52:42 and be brothers.
01:52:44 So, he's, he's- A midlife crisis,
01:52:46 essentially. Yeah, well, he's not that much older
01:52:48 than me. I think he's, like, 33.
01:52:50 But, um,
01:52:52 yeah, he's, uh, he just decided
01:52:54 that, you know, I don't want to be
01:52:56 Johnny Old School anymore. I don't feel like that person
01:52:58 is me anymore, which I totally get
01:53:00 because I look back on, you know,
01:53:02 the beginning of drowning in footwear. Like, that person's
01:53:04 not me anymore, you know? Right.
01:53:06 And you're very into, like,
01:53:08 changing names and having
01:53:10 names for, uh, yeah,
01:53:12 different meanings and stuff like that, because
01:53:14 there was, like, for the longest
01:53:16 time, everything was the
01:53:18 drowning man. You were drowning
01:53:20 in footwear, drowning in horseshoes,
01:53:22 drowning in K-fabe,
01:53:24 and then once the horseshoe
01:53:26 finale came out, then all of it
01:53:28 changed. And we're
01:53:30 not drowning anymore, as the song
01:53:32 went. Yeah, it's, um,
01:53:34 I sorta- I- I like
01:53:36 collecting accolades and titles for myself
01:53:38 over time, because I sorta feel like,
01:53:40 you know, every chapter
01:53:42 has its end, and it shouldn't overstay its welcome
01:53:44 and you should always be evolving and changing.
01:53:46 And I sort of view it like
01:53:48 how in the Hobbit, in that scene
01:53:50 in the book, where, um, he-
01:53:52 he is, like, describing himself to someone
01:53:54 later on in the book, and he's giving himself
01:53:56 all these fanciful names, like, I am the
01:53:58 barrel rider, Bilbo Baggins, I am
01:54:00 the troll fucker, I fucking-
01:54:02 I have a ring in my pocket,
01:54:04 I'm the pocket man! Look at me!
01:54:06 You know, he's, like, giving them- he- he's giving
01:54:08 himself all these fanciful accolades. That's always, like,
01:54:10 what comes into my head when I think about it. When I
01:54:12 go on my five minute
01:54:14 spiels of catchphrases and names for myself
01:54:16 when I'm-
01:54:18 Yeah.
01:54:20 Well, now it's been ruined by, uh,
01:54:22 Daenerys Targaryen.
01:54:24 That's true, she took that, she ruined my thing,
01:54:26 that was my thing, she stole it from me,
01:54:28 I should be getting residual checks on that.
01:54:30 Yeah.
01:54:32 Oh, she does it, it's not nearly as cool.
01:54:34 I am- I am the master of the listing
01:54:36 of the accolades.
01:54:38 I am the gu- I am the king of names.
01:54:40 I am the gu- I am the king of names.
01:54:42 And that's a new name right there.
01:54:44 I- I, like, I definitely found it
01:54:46 exciting when you changed all the names,
01:54:48 but it was really funny just because
01:54:50 of the fact that again, and-
01:54:52 Ah, fuck!
01:54:54 This is, like, the biggest piece of shit
01:54:56 right now in the history
01:54:58 of mankind. I don't know why he's doing this.
01:55:00 He keeps cutting out. This is out of control.
01:55:02 I'm gonna fucking kill myself,
01:55:04 I'm gonna kill every person
01:55:06 in the world, I'm going to grab a fucking
01:55:08 end to mine, I'm going to run
01:55:10 into an angel and blow myself up,
01:55:12 they're gonna replace me from a clone from the
01:55:14 spank tank.
01:55:16 Why the fuck is this happening to me?
01:55:18 I just wanna do a fucking
01:55:20 podcast.
01:55:22 Oh god, can you hear me?
01:55:24 Yeah.
01:55:26 Okay, Jesus fucking Christ.
01:55:28 Oh man, I don't even remember
01:55:30 what I was gonna say, I was blinded by rage,
01:55:32 I was fucking screaming when it cut out.
01:55:34 Um,
01:55:36 yeah, again, just,
01:55:38 when you changed to Endless Jest, it was really funny
01:55:40 because at the time,
01:55:42 that was gonna be the, like,
01:55:44 this is gonna be the channel of just big
01:55:46 videos, and then it, like,
01:55:48 very quickly became
01:55:50 not the case.
01:55:52 But, um,
01:55:54 I don't know, I've been pretty down for
01:55:56 everywhere that your journey has been taking
01:55:58 you, because on the one
01:56:00 hand, yeah, I do want
01:56:02 the big, intelligent
01:56:04 Jesse Wood content, because
01:56:06 obviously, it's always
01:56:08 exciting to get that from anybody,
01:56:10 but I still think the stuff
01:56:12 you're doing is stuff I don't get anywhere else,
01:56:14 you know, like. Yeah, and definitely
01:56:16 I still have the plans for those videos
01:56:18 that I was planning a year ago.
01:56:20 A lot of them have been pushed back
01:56:22 because so much of what I do is spontaneous,
01:56:24 even big videos, like, what you're gonna
01:56:26 do, or the two-flaggots videos,
01:56:28 those weren't videos that I planned, I had planned to do,
01:56:30 you know, I had a whole list of things
01:56:32 that I wanted to analyze and make big tributes
01:56:34 to, and videos about, but those ideas
01:56:36 came up, and I had to focus on those and make those,
01:56:38 and those were big videos too, so
01:56:40 I just do everything kind of spontaneous,
01:56:42 spontaneous. Spontaneity
01:56:44 is my blessing and curse. It gets
01:56:46 in the way of everything that I want to do, but sometimes
01:56:48 yields positive results, nevertheless.
01:56:50 Right. I think I'm
01:56:52 a lot more positive, uh,
01:56:54 rather patient as a viewer,
01:56:56 because, like, for me personally,
01:56:58 I get all these people all the time
01:57:00 who are, like, asking me to talk about this show
01:57:02 or that show, and I'm like, guys,
01:57:04 my channel's not going anywhere.
01:57:06 Like, this is,
01:57:08 like, for me, when I look at the future,
01:57:10 it's like, it's always gonna be
01:57:12 making more stuff, and making
01:57:14 more videos, and if you hang around
01:57:16 long enough, I'm gonna talk about everything,
01:57:18 you know, and I get
01:57:20 that same sense from you, where
01:57:22 there's never this sense of, like,
01:57:24 that you're only
01:57:26 that you're just coming up with it on the spot.
01:57:28 There's always a sense that there's way more
01:57:30 waiting in the wings, that it's already planned,
01:57:32 that there's already more stuff coming,
01:57:34 where, like, uh, you know,
01:57:36 I watch a lot of YouTubers, and I can sort of
01:57:38 feel the moment when they ran out of ideas,
01:57:40 when they, like,
01:57:42 hit the wall, and now they're
01:57:44 they're trying to come up with new stuff
01:57:46 fast enough to keep their audience
01:57:48 entertained, but they don't really
01:57:50 have the ideas. I have the opposite problem.
01:57:52 Like, I wish that my hands could work
01:57:54 as fast as my brain. I can never
01:57:56 catch up to the
01:57:58 monument, the monumental fucking
01:58:00 mountain, the backlog of ideas that I
01:58:02 have at any given moment, and it's always getting bigger.
01:58:04 I can't really chip away at it,
01:58:06 because, like, I don't feel like
01:58:08 I'm never getting another
01:58:10 big Jesse experiment
01:58:12 thing, like, I know it's gonna happen, because I know
01:58:14 your nature as a creator, you make things
01:58:16 get too big, you blow them out
01:58:18 of proportion, um, so
01:58:20 eventually it's gonna happen.
01:58:22 Yeah, like, just the other day, like,
01:58:24 I, uh, I got this
01:58:26 idea to do a vlog about comics,
01:58:28 and I'm like, this is a good idea for a
01:58:30 vlog, so I go to film, I can't
01:58:32 film because people are home and they're making noise,
01:58:34 so I fucking, I go outside
01:58:36 and I walk around, and while I'm walking around, I'm thinking
01:58:38 about what I want to say, and
01:58:40 the more I think about what I want to say,
01:58:42 the more it becomes things I have to say, and the more it becomes
01:58:44 a script, and so then
01:58:46 I get home, and I can't fucking film it
01:58:48 as a vlog anymore, because it's become too intelligent
01:58:50 and too important to just
01:58:52 spew out an inarticulate, incoherent
01:58:54 vlog, so I gotta write it all out, and now
01:58:56 it's a script waiting to actually be created
01:58:58 and edited, which is ten times more work, and it'll never
01:59:00 fucking get done. That's how it always happens,
01:59:02 and I think another thing that
01:59:04 like, uh, hinders
01:59:06 the videos coming out that I want to make
01:59:08 is because, um,
01:59:10 my videos
01:59:12 just the way that I make them,
01:59:14 they all tend to have, like, an inherent
01:59:16 continuity to them,
01:59:18 and not even when I'm deliberately
01:59:20 telling a story arc or something,
01:59:22 not even when I'm deliberately putting continuity
01:59:24 in them, just always in the background
01:59:26 or, like, philosophically when I'm approaching
01:59:28 what videos I'm currently making,
01:59:30 because it'll be, like,
01:59:32 uh, I fuck, totally lost my
01:59:34 train of thought right there. I like the beer quest.
01:59:36 Yeah, it's like,
01:59:38 if I'm doing fucking, like, I have this
01:59:40 great idea for this video,
01:59:42 but this video will only make sense
01:59:44 after I do this video, and I
01:59:46 can't do this video until I get all of these
01:59:48 little things out of the way so that that one makes sense.
01:59:50 But none of these little things are going to make any sense
01:59:52 unless I set them up with this thing first.
01:59:54 So no matter what I want to do,
01:59:56 it always becomes, like, this weird act of
01:59:58 dominoes where, like, I have to
02:00:00 fucking foresee 30 steps into
02:00:02 the future and then work my way backwards
02:00:04 from what I want to do to get
02:00:06 to the point where I can make that video.
02:00:08 Yeah, I'd say
02:00:10 more so than a continuity, it's like a
02:00:12 train of thought. Like,
02:00:14 I mean, even with all the
02:00:16 random vlogs, there's always this
02:00:18 very vague sense of
02:00:20 them happening one after another
02:00:22 and that that's the best, like, the
02:00:24 reason this vlog is happening is because
02:00:26 of the last vlog, you know,
02:00:28 where, like, something happened in that
02:00:30 one that's affected you to make
02:00:32 this one. And
02:00:34 yeah, I mean, it makes
02:00:36 sense, and I've gotten into
02:00:38 that too before where I've had
02:00:40 stuff that only made
02:00:42 sense to me at the time, and then once I
02:00:44 held onto the script for too long, it just no longer
02:00:46 felt like it would, like,
02:00:48 why would I do this now? This was
02:00:50 a story for then, you know,
02:00:52 um, and now it's
02:00:54 dead. And it's weird to me that, like,
02:00:56 all of the ideas that I had
02:00:58 for endless just content when I started the channel
02:01:00 are ideas that I still have
02:01:02 waiting in the wings, a series that I want to
02:01:04 do, like, uh, fucking,
02:01:06 I don't even fucking know, like,
02:01:08 I don't know what it is that makes it so hard
02:01:10 for me, because, like, I similarly have
02:01:12 an endless sea of ideas,
02:01:14 and it's just a matter of, like,
02:01:16 psyching myself to
02:01:18 write them, like. Yeah, and it's also,
02:01:20 like, you know, um,
02:01:22 breaking them apart into little chunks,
02:01:24 because I do want to make more,
02:01:26 like, analytical videos, like,
02:01:28 Nerdwriter, and I've, like, as much as I complain
02:01:30 about Nerdwriter, he's kind of
02:01:32 becoming an influence, like, just the way
02:01:34 that he makes his videos, like,
02:01:36 I don't have to make a huge
02:01:38 blowout analysis of a show,
02:01:40 I can pick the elements
02:01:42 of the show one at a time, and make five
02:01:44 minute videos about those. So, for example,
02:01:46 that's, that's a huge thing I've
02:01:48 been doing now. So I have this,
02:01:50 I have this gigantic, like,
02:01:52 I have a gigantic, I have, like, a 30
02:01:54 page analysis of Hey Arnold,
02:01:56 that I wrote, like, two years
02:01:58 ago, and I'll
02:02:00 never fucking do it, except
02:02:02 just recently, I took a look at it, and, like, wait a minute,
02:02:04 I can segment this off here, and here, and here,
02:02:06 and make, like, four different videos about this.
02:02:08 And maybe that'll help in the future
02:02:10 to get these analytics, because I want
02:02:12 to go back to having more analytical videos.
02:02:14 I just, I don't just want to be
02:02:16 vlog, I don't ever just want to be one
02:02:18 thing, ever. Right.
02:02:20 Not just a ranty man,
02:02:22 it is a, it is a basement. Yeah.
02:02:24 Um, yeah, man, it's,
02:02:26 I, I picked up on that, like, big time
02:02:28 recently, too, where it was, like, it always
02:02:30 felt like I had to either do
02:02:32 a short review that didn't say enough,
02:02:34 or a long review that had to say
02:02:36 everything, and that at some point, I went,
02:02:38 like, hey, what if I, like,
02:02:40 did Ava episode by episode,
02:02:42 you know? I'd say that was, like,
02:02:44 that was sort of what made me realize I could do
02:02:46 that was the Ava stuff,
02:02:48 because for years, and you've had the same problem
02:02:50 with the same show, I know,
02:02:52 that you've wanted to talk about Ava for so long,
02:02:54 and it's just the daunting nature of it. And here's,
02:02:56 here's what I came up with
02:02:58 to solve that dilemma, and this is going to be
02:03:00 happening, and I'm going to let this cat out of the bag right now,
02:03:02 because I'm excited about it, I want everyone to know
02:03:04 this genius idea that I've had.
02:03:06 I'm going to make a new series on my Japanese
02:03:08 animes, loosely based
02:03:10 on Nate's series,
02:03:12 and it's going to be called, Best
02:03:14 Anime
02:03:15 Ever.
02:03:17 And it's all going to be Ava.
02:03:19 Eh, eh, yes, applause,
02:03:21 applause for that brilliant fucking pun!
02:03:23 I'm a genius! I'm going to take the anime
02:03:25 YouTuber world by storm!
02:03:28 That's pretty great. And then all those fucking
02:03:30 gods on the Ava subreddit
02:03:32 who fucking downvoted and
02:03:34 whined about my Ask
02:03:36 AMV, they're all going to see, when I become
02:03:38 the internet's undisputed king
02:03:40 of Avangelion analysis, they're all going to see
02:03:42 how wrong they were, and they're going to
02:03:44 beg me for forgiveness, and I will say
02:03:46 the nay! Be gone with you
02:03:48 cad! Be gone from my kingdom!
02:03:50 You are banished from the land!
02:03:55 We'll lead us to kings,
02:03:58 We'll fucking lead us to kings!
02:04:02 Oh man, that is a good idea.
02:04:05 Yeah, I thought it was interesting too
02:04:07 you mentioned Nerdwriter, because
02:04:09 you said the phrase, the medium is the
02:04:11 message twice at the start of this podcast
02:04:13 which is his video
02:04:15 that I keep quoting all the time.
02:04:19 But yeah, it's, I would
02:04:21 love to see more of it, and I think another thing
02:04:23 that would help you
02:04:25 that I've adopted
02:04:27 is just not being afraid of retreading
02:04:29 stuff, like
02:04:31 at some point I realized
02:04:33 that, because I'm always going to hate
02:04:35 my old review of something, like
02:04:37 my opinion changes over time, or I figure
02:04:39 out more to say about it,
02:04:41 and so like, when I
02:04:43 first started doing anime videos
02:04:45 it was mostly these 10-20
02:04:47 minute reviews of a show
02:04:49 and now I'm going back
02:04:51 and looking at those, and being like, this doesn't say
02:04:53 anywhere near all that I have to say about it.
02:04:55 And I could do
02:04:57 like 30 more videos about this show
02:04:59 you know, I could just keep doing videos about it
02:05:01 forever, and what's great about these
02:05:03 vlogs I've been doing is that it
02:05:05 lets me just like
02:05:07 get the basic thought out there, like
02:05:09 you know, all these ideas that I've got
02:05:11 in my head that I'm like, oh well
02:05:13 it's not enough to make a whole video out of it
02:05:15 but I kind of have this idea
02:05:17 and I just like burned through like 30 of those
02:05:19 things that have just been like weighing on
02:05:21 my mind, and some of them
02:05:23 it's great because they were stupid
02:05:25 like the Metroidvania thing
02:05:27 like for like a year I legitimately
02:05:29 wanted to make like a full analysis
02:05:31 video about why Metroidvania is a bad
02:05:33 term, and then I made the vlog about it
02:05:35 and like within days I was like, that's the
02:05:37 stupidest vlog ever, like
02:05:39 no one gives a fuck
02:05:41 this would have been a terrible video, it would have
02:05:43 been a huge waste of time, I'm so glad you
02:05:45 bring up it. It's funny that you bring up the
02:05:47 Metroidvania vlog because it goes into what we
02:05:49 were talking about before, with things
02:05:51 spiraling out of control and getting too intricate
02:05:53 because I made a reply video
02:05:55 to that vlog to go with yours
02:05:57 and Nate's, and
02:05:59 in the making of my reply
02:06:01 video it became
02:06:03 way too intricate and it became an actual
02:06:05 video, and then
02:06:07 I realized that I
02:06:09 can't post this video yet
02:06:11 because in order to make this video how I
02:06:13 want it, Colt Corona needs
02:06:15 to come out of the furnace room and he hasn't yet
02:06:17 so now that
02:06:19 video is now waiting in the wings
02:06:21 because Colt Corona is still barricaded
02:06:23 in my damn furnace room.
02:06:25 Do you even still want to do that video
02:06:27 now that you've heard me talk about how
02:06:29 retarded even I find my own
02:06:31 Metroidvania video? No, I still
02:06:33 want to do it because it's going to be hilarious, it's going to be great.
02:06:35 Don't you have some
02:06:37 Dark Souls 2 response videos that you
02:06:39 made as well? Yeah, I made
02:06:41 Baby Bro plays Dark Souls 2
02:06:43 and it's
02:06:45 I made a character called
02:06:47 Baby Bro, first
02:06:49 he was named Dildo Bro, but then I changed it to
02:06:51 Baby Bro, and it's
02:06:53 just a big fat you in a diaper
02:06:55 going around going
02:06:57 why is the animation
02:06:59 so bad? These
02:07:01 ladies are mean, they're telling me the game
02:07:03 is hard, it's stupid
02:07:05 and I did
02:07:07 that for about an hour
02:07:09 and then that's still coming out, right?
02:07:11 Yeah, I made
02:07:13 that, but then to go along with it
02:07:15 I also made a let's play of me playing
02:07:17 the game with my like normal narration
02:07:19 talking about the things about the game that I like
02:07:21 and I was going to splice them together
02:07:23 and just the act of splicing them together became like
02:07:25 I don't give a shit about this anymore, fuck it
02:07:27 and I don't care at all
02:07:29 about those Dark Souls 2 videos
02:07:31 Yeah, that's the thing, it's a
02:07:33 debate that neither of us care to win
02:07:35 No
02:07:37 I don't, it's like
02:07:39 well like I said, I really went into it
02:07:41 like with this venomous like
02:07:43 yeah, nobody's chat on this game enough
02:07:45 I'm going to shit on it harder than anybody
02:07:47 and then like very quickly I realized
02:07:49 I have two problems with the game
02:07:51 that aren't like, obviously
02:07:53 if you like the game, those two things
02:07:55 don't bother you, so
02:07:57 this is not helpful for anybody
02:07:59 you know, like the only people who are going to be entertained
02:08:01 are people who already feel exactly like I feel
02:08:03 and don't need me to tell them all this stuff
02:08:05 you know
02:08:07 so yeah
02:08:09 those videos are terrible
02:08:11 man, especially after like part 4
02:08:13 they just get really... it's funny that like
02:08:15 you did that video
02:08:17 and then immediately after
02:08:19 Aiden did his Serious Sam video
02:08:21 which was the same video
02:08:23 but much worse
02:08:25 yeah, but like
02:08:27 watching both of you guys do that
02:08:29 it like sort of inspired me to like
02:08:31 I wish that there was a game
02:08:33 that I hated this much, that I could also
02:08:35 let's play and do one of these of my own
02:08:37 and just pedantically bitch about
02:08:39 every single tiny detail to the point of absurdity
02:08:41 but like I couldn't think
02:08:43 of a game that I hate enough
02:08:45 and like take it off the rails in a way
02:08:47 like because I know that's how it would go with you
02:08:49 you would eventually
02:08:51 it would go beyond the impossible
02:08:53 like the only things
02:08:55 like the only things that I could think of
02:08:57 were like, okay, Final Fantasy 13
02:08:59 but everybody's already done that
02:09:01 it's the most overdone fucking thing in the world
02:09:03 and there's only one complaint
02:09:05 it's a hallway
02:09:07 wow, that's the whole fucking video
02:09:09 that and the story doesn't make any sense
02:09:11 two complaints, so why, what's even the point
02:09:13 and then the other one
02:09:15 was Mass Effect 3
02:09:17 but that's a fucking 40 hour game
02:09:19 I'm not ever playing a 40 hour game
02:09:21 that I know I hate
02:09:23 well, it's only like 25 hours
02:09:25 well maybe I'll do it then
02:09:29 well that was also the conclusion
02:09:31 I reached with Dark Souls 2
02:09:33 it's long and
02:09:35 if I had unique things
02:09:37 to say about every level
02:09:39 then it would have been worth it
02:09:41 I recorded three episodes with Shade
02:09:43 two of which I haven't released yet
02:09:45 but when I'm playing with him
02:09:47 because he hates the game too
02:09:49 but he's amazing at it
02:09:51 and watching him play it I really couldn't
02:09:53 even process what was happening fast enough
02:09:55 to complain about it and I was like
02:09:57 why am I doing this, I have no stakes in this game
02:09:59 and even Mass Effect 3
02:10:01 is so over talked about
02:10:03 who gives a shit at this point
02:10:05 I actually think
02:10:07 Mass Effect 3 might be
02:10:09 underrated at this point
02:10:11 people shout on it so much
02:10:13 when a lot of it's pretty good
02:10:15 there are parts of the story
02:10:17 that are really cool
02:10:19 like the fucking
02:10:21 the part with the fucking
02:10:23 yeah
02:10:25 the Morden
02:10:27 the Morden's part is great in that game
02:10:29 that's about it I guess
02:10:31 it's one of the best parts in the whole fucking series
02:10:33 the game has to get some credit
02:10:37 but yeah
02:10:39 so there has to be like I have to find
02:10:41 a game that's like
02:10:43 all gameplay
02:10:45 that only I hate
02:10:47 and I hate psychotically and no one else does
02:10:49 and I don't think a game like that exists
02:10:51 or if it does I can't think of it
02:10:53 so alright
02:10:55 I know that for the future
02:10:57 of your work
02:10:59 you're definitely planning to put more into my Japanese
02:11:01 animes
02:11:03 that's like the channel you're considering
02:11:05 this will get me big
02:11:07 that has to be the channel that I
02:11:09 promote when I'm telling people about myself
02:11:11 because it's the only channel that makes sense
02:11:13 and I'm determined to have it keep making sense
02:11:15 I'm determined to
02:11:17 keep all of my weird meta shit
02:11:19 away from it as far away as possible
02:11:21 no dumb story arcs at all
02:11:23 my Japanese anime has to remain pure
02:11:25 for the good of all mankind
02:11:27 well I've always felt like what makes
02:11:29 my Japanese animes work is that
02:11:31 it seems like
02:11:33 you have less
02:11:35 stakes in anime than any other
02:11:37 medium
02:11:39 where it's kind of like you're not the big anime guy
02:11:41 like I am
02:11:43 and because someone like me exists
02:11:45 you don't have to be
02:11:49 cause it's so irreverent
02:11:51 and dumb in a way where
02:11:53 if you made a Hey Arnold video
02:11:55 you wouldn't want it to be that
02:11:57 cause you want to prove to the world
02:11:59 how cool Hey Arnold is
02:12:01 but with Japanese animes
02:12:03 it's like attack on Titan who fucking cares
02:12:05 write the dumbest
02:12:07 most irreverent review of it possible
02:12:09 but it's funny and that's what makes it work
02:12:11 and in a lot of ways that's better than doing a critique
02:12:13 or an analysis because I talk all the time
02:12:15 about how I can't stand
02:12:17 critics or reviewers
02:12:19 and I think reviews are a medium
02:12:21 where I can't lie and be wiped off the face of the earth
02:12:23 and what I like about my Japanese animes
02:12:25 is like even if I sometimes
02:12:27 like I complain about bleach in the video
02:12:29 but the video is more about
02:12:31 sharing bleach with everybody
02:12:33 the purpose of the videos on that channel
02:12:35 is to like I like anime
02:12:37 let's all like anime together
02:12:39 and talk about how silly it is
02:12:41 I always felt like what's great about those videos
02:12:43 and this is something that they really have
02:12:45 the most in common with the donkey I think
02:12:47 who I only got into more recently
02:12:49 but like they're good at
02:12:51 cutting very quickly to the heart
02:12:53 of like how you feel about it
02:12:55 it's not about like
02:12:57 it's like a very like with the bleach one
02:12:59 the point of it is
02:13:01 I liked it when I was a teenager
02:13:03 because it was stylish and cool
02:13:05 it went downhill over the years and like
02:13:07 that's the important facts to you
02:13:09 not like the why
02:13:11 but the fact that that's what happened
02:13:13 and you presented in this hilarious way
02:13:15 or with Pokemon where
02:13:17 that one's fucking amazing because it's really
02:13:19 it's not really about
02:13:21 Pokemon per se it's about
02:13:23 the disillusionment that comes with growing up
02:13:25 and realizing that you were
02:13:27 infatuated with a commercial product
02:13:29 that has moved on to another generation
02:13:31 you know and
02:13:33 it's fucking genius like
02:13:35 because yeah you could talk about
02:13:37 what actually happens in Pokemon
02:13:39 but instead you just concentrated
02:13:41 on the emotional connection
02:13:43 you have with it and
02:13:45 I think that's what a lot of those videos are
02:13:47 with something like Madoka
02:13:49 it's just like it's a fun blue be cool
02:13:51 show so here's a fun blue be cool
02:13:53 poem about it yeah we did it
02:13:55 you know there's nothing more that needs
02:13:57 to be said you made the point
02:13:59 it's cool
02:14:01 so yeah I think
02:14:03 that channel works well for that
02:14:05 but anyway back the reason I brought
02:14:07 it up that channel
02:14:09 I know you're planning to put some more
02:14:11 focus on you've got the big endless just
02:14:13 videos that are still
02:14:15 stashed away somewhere
02:14:17 at some point the man child incorporated arc
02:14:19 will end is that channel going to stay active
02:14:21 after that do you think
02:14:23 yeah I think man child incorporated will still exist
02:14:25 because I still think it's a funny gimmick and I still
02:14:27 I still have ideas
02:14:29 for shows to cover on it
02:14:31 that I didn't get to do before so I'll probably
02:14:33 get to them after I finish up the stupid arc
02:14:35 it's such a stupid
02:14:37 thing and like it's such a knowingly stupid
02:14:39 thing like that's the point like
02:14:41 the horseshoes saga was kind of meant to be
02:14:43 deep or like insightful
02:14:45 or poignant or important
02:14:47 to me right so that's what it's
02:14:49 so that's what it became but like from
02:14:51 the inception of this one
02:14:53 this was meant to be
02:14:55 retarded and so
02:14:57 I've succeeded more than I thought
02:14:59 possible in that
02:15:01 I've made it so fucking retarded I barely
02:15:03 even want to do it
02:15:05 right I I completely
02:15:07 know that feeling though because I've got
02:15:09 I think that's what happened
02:15:11 with uh I have a lot
02:15:13 of these ideas like plans for very
02:15:15 small anime videos that are
02:15:17 like they'll be easy to write
02:15:19 and like catchy and fun
02:15:21 but they're so
02:15:23 not artistically fulfilling
02:15:25 that I can't bring myself to write
02:15:27 them where it'll be like
02:15:29 like some of the like cool character designs
02:15:31 and stuff like that like I have a bunch of great ideas
02:15:33 for that but for me it's
02:15:35 like if I'm not doing this 12
02:15:37 part you know hours long
02:15:39 takedown of some show or whatever
02:15:41 then I don't feel like I'm
02:15:43 doing like I don't feel like I'm living up to my full potential
02:15:45 you know so it's like
02:15:47 when am I gonna make
02:15:49 the next video that makes people
02:15:51 rethink what an anime analysis
02:15:53 on YouTube can be like that's what I
02:15:55 you know what I'm worried about
02:15:57 even though I don't have any ideas for that so
02:15:59 instead I'm just doing nothing
02:16:01 because I can't do one way or the other
02:16:03 um
02:16:05 would you say that's comparable
02:16:07 yeah we all uh
02:16:09 I think you might have talked
02:16:11 about this on Digi Bros maybe not
02:16:13 but we all as a group decided
02:16:15 that like we had squad goals for June
02:16:17 and we all amongst ourselves
02:16:19 were like okay guys we're gonna kick
02:16:21 so much ass in June we're all gonna have a bunch
02:16:23 of great videos we're gonna stop fucking around
02:16:25 where the fuck's Nate's new video now that you mention it
02:16:27 and
02:16:29 like we all were gung ho about June
02:16:31 none of us have done anything
02:16:33 with this been the same shit
02:16:35 no it's
02:16:37 it's particularly bad because it was like
02:16:39 the last day
02:16:41 of May I got out of
02:16:43 video you got out of
02:16:45 vlog and uh
02:16:47 I think Hippo had like a short video he did
02:16:49 or no he did the GRPJ video on Kingdom Hearts
02:16:51 and Nate was saying
02:16:53 that he had a video that was gonna come out
02:16:55 that day
02:16:57 it's been nine
02:16:59 fucking days
02:17:01 and Nate's video hasn't come out yet
02:17:05 what the fuck is happening
02:17:07 I haven't done
02:17:09 jack shit
02:17:11 you haven't done jack shit
02:17:13 in terms of what you said you were gonna do
02:17:15 um
02:17:17 I know Hippo's
02:17:19 working towards a video
02:17:21 but he's having difficulty on the technical
02:17:23 end but yeah
02:17:25 it was definitely like squad goals
02:17:27 June's the month and
02:17:29 yeah
02:17:31 I just keep doing podcasts
02:17:33 instead
02:17:35 it's just easier and again like I said
02:17:37 like
02:17:39 like when I said like June
02:17:41 like yeah I'm gonna have all these plans
02:17:43 like I have so many ideas for videos
02:17:45 and I just like I can't get excited about them
02:17:47 because they're not big enough nothing's big enough
02:17:49 to make me feel like I'm following up
02:17:51 the asterisk war videos
02:17:53 yeah it's like fucking it's like heroin
02:17:55 you know that first high
02:17:57 is the best one and then
02:17:59 you need a bigger one you need only
02:18:01 a huge fucking hit will satisfy you
02:18:03 everything else just feels like small potatoes
02:18:05 and you finish like 10 vlogs in one day
02:18:07 and you've got all this content but none of it means
02:18:09 anything and it's just killing your soul
02:18:11 slowly well for me the hardest part
02:18:13 is that like because
02:18:15 last month I got so used to doing vlogs
02:18:17 and I'm having fun
02:18:19 with it and I like that I'm sort of like finding
02:18:21 new ways to do them
02:18:23 but I can't
02:18:25 monetize vlogs and I have to pay
02:18:27 the DeVoo like he has
02:18:29 dedicated his self
02:18:31 to full time being my video editor so if
02:18:33 I don't give him videos then he's also
02:18:35 fucked so it's like
02:18:37 we both need me to be writing scripts
02:18:39 um
02:18:41 and I'm so down on ideas
02:18:43 but uh yeah
02:18:45 enough about me this podcast is about you
02:18:47 what I was leading up to
02:18:49 by saying that I I know but we are all the
02:18:51 DeVoo
02:18:53 um
02:18:55 I know what the future holds
02:18:57 for the the endless
02:18:59 Jess saga but are there any
02:19:01 like big projects that you completely
02:19:03 will never do that you wanted
02:19:05 to do like throughout your whole career
02:19:07 um I don't know
02:19:09 I remain hopeful about pretty much
02:19:11 everything I mean
02:19:13 there might be videos that I've written that I wouldn't
02:19:15 now would think are stupid
02:19:17 and shouldn't be done but I can't really think of them
02:19:19 like I still want to do gun buster on my Japanese
02:19:21 anime is I still want to do all my millions of
02:19:23 Ava videos and my big cowboy bebop video
02:19:25 and all that shit there's a million endless
02:19:27 Jess videos I want to do
02:19:29 I it's
02:19:31 you know logically I know it's impossible
02:19:33 that I'll ever do all of them but I have to
02:19:35 remain hopeful about my
02:19:37 because I have so many like complete scripts
02:19:39 that are good that are so good
02:19:41 that have been sitting there for some of them
02:19:43 for years and it's
02:19:45 just sad that I that I
02:19:47 don't have like a team of editors
02:19:49 or something to finish this shit for me
02:19:53 and you also are but you also don't trust
02:19:55 editors you're not a fan
02:19:57 of the idea of handing your work away
02:19:59 yeah well I was talking to DeVoo about
02:20:01 this and it's not
02:20:03 necessarily that I don't trust the editors
02:20:05 it's that I don't trust
02:20:07 my ability to articulate myself
02:20:09 to them over the internet because
02:20:11 if DeVoo and I
02:20:13 if you're if you were editing a video of mine
02:20:15 and we were in the same house I could come up to
02:20:17 anyone and say hey man put this here
02:20:19 and put that there alright but over the internet
02:20:21 like I hate communicating
02:20:23 over the internet it feels not human
02:20:25 and it feels awkward and it's hard to express
02:20:27 like an artistic idea
02:20:29 over the internet
02:20:31 I would agree with that
02:20:33 and I'm not I'm not into collabs
02:20:35 either like again I've said this
02:20:37 before but the reason I hired DeVoo is
02:20:39 because he understood
02:20:41 everything I was doing perfectly
02:20:43 and can do it better you know
02:20:45 so there was
02:20:47 because I think I was
02:20:49 like re-listening to some podcast
02:20:51 that we did where I was describing
02:20:53 that like
02:20:55 I just like it's not that I
02:20:57 don't have an idea of how to make the videos
02:20:59 better I just won't do it
02:21:01 because like I'm lazy and
02:21:03 I want it out too fast
02:21:05 so like I'll think well
02:21:07 this might look better if I did
02:21:09 some effect here but uh fuck it
02:21:11 you know and so I give it to DeVoo
02:21:13 because he'll have the same instinct but he'll do it
02:21:15 so
02:21:17 that's what makes him a great editor for me
02:21:19 but yeah I could easily see
02:21:21 like you know he can't just
02:21:23 instinctually know what funny
02:21:25 anime face you'd put in at a part
02:21:27 you know yeah
02:21:29 in the editing that you would do
02:21:31 so alright
02:21:33 so you don't have any projects that are just
02:21:35 completely cutting room floor gone
02:21:37 at least at present
02:21:39 I know there was a point
02:21:41 where you were gonna adopt Johnny
02:21:43 old school's name and become
02:21:45 oh yeah yeah before I settled on Endless
02:21:47 Jess
02:21:49 my idea was uh the old school
02:21:51 fool
02:21:53 and that's where that silly catchphrase came from
02:21:55 where um uh Johnny was gonna
02:21:57 give me his domain name
02:21:59 and I was gonna
02:22:01 because I had so many channels and I didn't know what I was doing with him yet
02:22:03 so I got the idea that I wanted like a website
02:22:05 for all of them I don't really I guess that's
02:22:07 something that's on the cutting room floor that I don't care about anymore
02:22:09 is getting my own website because who gives a shit
02:22:11 right I think we've all
02:22:13 had that like there was a long
02:22:15 time where we were coming up with all these different
02:22:17 ways to make a website for like the whole
02:22:19 horseshoe crew or just some of us and
02:22:21 it's just nobody goes to websites
02:22:23 anymore so it doesn't feel like there's a point
02:22:25 to it
02:22:27 um oh
02:22:29 here's one though that you used
02:22:31 I just remembered this
02:22:33 you used to talk about starting
02:22:35 up the series all the time but I have no
02:22:37 idea if you're still intending on it at all
02:22:39 because I haven't heard you bring it up in well over a year
02:22:41 spirit of the 90s
02:22:43 oh yeah I forgot
02:22:45 about good old spirit of the
02:22:47 oh fuck god the thing about spirit of the
02:22:49 90s is that I'm running
02:22:51 out of time because
02:22:53 the joke behind
02:22:55 spirit of the 90s it was
02:22:57 gonna be like a 90s nostalgia show
02:22:59 but
02:23:01 I would be in like
02:23:03 an old man costume
02:23:05 and the joke was that
02:23:07 I'm only in my
02:23:09 20s but I feel like a fucking old
02:23:11 man so I'm like
02:23:13 doing this like 90s
02:23:15 nostalgia show from the perspective
02:23:17 of remember those stick on
02:23:19 earrings and that you would put
02:23:21 in those fucking braces that you'd
02:23:23 slap on your hands I'm gonna
02:23:25 die soon and that was funny
02:23:27 because when I came up with the idea I was
02:23:29 23 now I'm almost 27
02:23:31 I feel like the joke is
02:23:33 running out of time I'm not gonna be
02:23:35 in my 20s much longer
02:23:37 and I'll just be legitimately
02:23:39 an old man which will ruin the entire
02:23:41 joke right I
02:23:43 didn't even realize that was part of it I just
02:23:45 remember that you were buying posters
02:23:47 for spirit of the 90s
02:23:49 like you bought the good burger poster for that
02:23:51 I think yeah another burger posters
02:23:53 a part of my room yeah because that was
02:23:55 like I always had the impression that the way
02:23:57 a Jesse Wood saga starts
02:23:59 is you buy everything for the set
02:24:01 and then you start writing the scripts
02:24:03 and all the Genesis it all
02:24:05 starts with me buying a poster
02:24:07 at 4am drunk on Amazon
02:24:09 and then a fucking arc comes
02:24:11 out of it
02:24:13 the fucking Miss
02:24:15 Elizabeth poster
02:24:17 got like 3 vlogs out of it
02:24:19 there's 3 videos and that's still
02:24:21 one of my favorite posters it's super cool
02:24:23 I uh yeah
02:24:25 I now have
02:24:27 more than enough Oscar posters
02:24:29 to put an entire wall
02:24:31 just Oscar
02:24:33 and I'm waiting for the right moment
02:24:35 to unleash that gag on the world
02:24:37 it has to be the right video
02:24:39 I remember
02:24:41 a time you told me
02:24:43 that you realized
02:24:45 that you suddenly looked around
02:24:47 your room and realized that you had all these
02:24:49 posters of a 14 year old girl
02:24:51 and that you're a 27 year old
02:24:53 man and you were like this is creepy
02:24:55 even for me
02:24:57 it's getting weird
02:24:59 I have to change I have to put
02:25:01 Misato posters up now for the next 15 years
02:25:03 and then I'll be 45
02:25:05 and I'll have to put up Gendo posters
02:25:11 oh god yeah
02:25:13 and then 15 years later it'll be Fuyutski
02:25:19 and then you can just die with that one
02:25:21 my whole life will just be a series of Ava Waifus
02:25:23 and Husbandos
02:25:27 oh shit
02:25:31 I'll just segment my autobiography
02:25:33 into the character names
02:25:37 so as
02:25:39 I'm wondering if this is going to become clear
02:25:41 when you start doing Ava videos
02:25:43 that much like
02:25:45 the previous mythos we've discussed
02:25:47 of all the
02:25:49 the characters that you have
02:25:51 you have been developing your own Ava
02:25:53 mythos in your head
02:25:55 that I've heard of
02:25:57 I'm going to just like hype people up
02:25:59 I don't know if you're still working on it
02:26:01 but you sent me the intro
02:26:03 chapter of a fanfic you're writing
02:26:05 that was fucking
02:26:07 amazing
02:26:09 and I
02:26:11 I know I'm a fan of all your work
02:26:13 but even you
02:26:15 if you post an Ava fanfic I go into it
02:26:17 like okay what's this going to be
02:26:19 and I read it and I was like
02:26:21 oh my god this is
02:26:23 like legitimately gripping
02:26:25 character portrait of Ray Ayanami
02:26:27 and the lead
02:26:29 in is that she's going to play Smash Bros
02:26:31 it's amazing
02:26:33 well the idea of it
02:26:35 I wanted to take
02:26:37 the dumbest possible premise
02:26:39 or the silliest possible spin on the series
02:26:41 but then approach it taking it completely
02:26:43 seriously and like really get into the character's
02:26:45 heads like
02:26:47 like a legit like I was actually
02:26:49 writing for the show and like really show
02:26:51 off that I understand these characters
02:26:53 while also having them
02:26:55 like the whole fucking plot is that
02:26:57 they're playing Nintendo 64
02:26:59 yeah it's
02:27:01 fucking incredible um I hope it
02:27:03 I hope it gets published at some
02:27:05 point I don't know how much of it you want
02:27:07 to write before any of it comes out
02:27:09 but the part you had written was fantastic
02:27:11 well it's another one of those things that like
02:27:13 in the making of it it's become more intricate
02:27:15 in my head than it originally was
02:27:17 because originally it was like
02:27:19 I'm gonna make a it's gonna be that
02:27:21 uh
02:27:23 Ray has an existential crisis
02:27:25 and decides
02:27:27 instinctually inherently as all
02:27:29 children know
02:27:31 that Nintendo 64 is the bomb yo
02:27:33 and so
02:27:35 she decides that she has to buy Nintendo 64
02:27:37 um
02:27:39 and what draws her eye to it
02:27:41 this was one of my proudest
02:27:43 little tidbits that I threw in there
02:27:45 was that it was one of the translucent purple
02:27:47 Nintendo 64s that they came out with
02:27:49 and it reminded her of Ikari's Ava
02:27:51 so
02:27:53 hahahaha
02:27:55 in all this is appropriate
02:27:57 because Ava takes place well never mind
02:27:59 it takes place in 2015
02:28:01 I was thinking it came out in 95
02:28:03 so it's appropriate but it's not
02:28:05 but that's uh
02:28:07 that's gonna be an element of it when I
02:28:09 because I'm still writing it um
02:28:11 one of the one of the ideas was that
02:28:13 Misato wipes the floor
02:28:15 with everyone at N64
02:28:17 because she's a fucking millennial
02:28:19 and she grew up with it
02:28:21 yeah that's actually genius
02:28:23 oh man I don't want you to spoil too
02:28:25 much of this thing but I legitimately
02:28:27 love it and I'm kind of expecting
02:28:29 that when you start making Ava videos
02:28:31 elements of
02:28:33 your ideas of the characters that go
02:28:35 beyond what's presented in the show
02:28:37 will probably creep in
02:28:39 because um
02:28:41 Idle Yukai who is a huge fan of all of us
02:28:43 on Twitter yes she's been going through
02:28:45 and she's been drawing pictures of us
02:28:47 like hanging out with our waifus
02:28:49 and I
02:28:51 already have instructed her to incorporate
02:28:53 an element of my coming fan fiction
02:28:55 into the picture just to make it
02:28:57 that much cooler
02:28:59 I just I have to wonder like
02:29:01 um I think
02:29:03 as I've said before I know your work
02:29:05 probably better than anybody else and
02:29:07 because of that I feel like I get more
02:29:09 out of it just because there's so many little
02:29:11 jokes and references
02:29:13 and I just wish
02:29:15 there was like a way
02:29:17 to stream every idea you have
02:29:19 out of your brain onto the internet
02:29:21 like just for everyone to know
02:29:23 all of these little details
02:29:25 because it would enhance it all so much
02:29:27 to get the whole narrative
02:29:29 of like
02:29:31 you know
02:29:33 you make an oska joke and like
02:29:35 it means more to me because I listen to you
02:29:37 talk about oska so fucking often
02:29:39 like I understand that it's this
02:29:41 legitimate obsession and
02:29:43 you haven't made that many videos
02:29:45 that talk about oska she's
02:29:47 around you clearly have a lot of posters
02:29:49 of her but like
02:29:51 you know I don't know if anybody else would
02:29:53 be as it seems like the things that are
02:29:55 like that I'm the most into
02:29:57 I end up making the least amount of content
02:29:59 about yeah I'm
02:30:01 dude I fucking feel the exact same way
02:30:03 just because like almost like I feel
02:30:05 like I owe it something
02:30:07 grander yeah
02:30:09 man like because
02:30:11 in a way it was
02:30:13 like when I started doing anime
02:30:15 videos what allowed me to
02:30:17 talk about all like my favorite shows
02:30:19 is that they all became my favorite
02:30:21 shows in the process of writing
02:30:23 about them because like all my
02:30:25 old favorites I haven't really
02:30:27 talked about a lot of them like
02:30:29 like a wreck of seven was
02:30:31 like my favorite anime for a long time and
02:30:33 like you know
02:30:35 now if I watch it again my opinion is
02:30:37 totally different because I've grown up so much so
02:30:39 like I had this weird lucky stroke where
02:30:41 back in my anime blogging
02:30:43 days I would never cover my favorite
02:30:45 shows because I felt like I had to write
02:30:47 the biggest post ever about each of them
02:30:49 and I just wouldn't
02:30:51 and then because of the fact that
02:30:53 I'd forgotten all my
02:30:55 I forgot everything about anime then like
02:30:57 now it's like I'm rediscovering
02:30:59 each one and I get to write about it because
02:31:01 you know like Kaon I
02:31:03 watch it again after all this time
02:31:05 and like now I'm trying to remember oh
02:31:07 this is why I liked this show so much
02:31:09 oh now I get it and I can write it much
02:31:11 more easily so I feel like
02:31:13 having this two-year gap away from anime
02:31:15 like really helped to make it so I could
02:31:17 finally write about shows I actually
02:31:19 care about as opposed to just random
02:31:21 bullshit because
02:31:23 it's way easier like I said with the
02:31:25 my Japanese anime thing before it's way
02:31:27 easier to go like watch attack on
02:31:29 Titan and you don't give a fuck about
02:31:31 it so you can write a five-minute video and it's over
02:31:33 you know yeah like the stuff that I
02:31:35 have like a lot of
02:31:37 passion for it's almost
02:31:39 daunting to like
02:31:41 get it done I can't
02:31:43 like get to it like um
02:31:45 like I'm passionate about music
02:31:47 I've wanted to make
02:31:49 my fucking debut rap album
02:31:51 for like seven years longer than
02:31:53 I've had a YouTube channel
02:31:55 and I release rap songs
02:31:57 all the time I make rap songs all the time
02:31:59 but they're all like weird freestyles
02:32:01 and dumb shit with like beats that I just
02:32:03 rip off the internet and
02:32:05 they're not like what I consider to be
02:32:07 part of this album that I formulated
02:32:09 in my head like in my head
02:32:11 in my head I have like
02:32:13 my first seven albums planned out
02:32:15 and there's a fucking they're all
02:32:17 fucking concept albums they all have a
02:32:19 purpose and a place like a fucking jigsaw puzzle
02:32:21 I you know I think about
02:32:23 but I haven't even fucking made the first one yet
02:32:25 and God knows when so many
02:32:27 things that like I want to do
02:32:29 that I'm almost
02:32:31 afraid that I won't get to do
02:32:33 because YouTube will always be in the way
02:32:35 unless I find a way to pull myself
02:32:37 away from it at some point
02:32:39 like uh like stand up comedy
02:32:41 I love doing stand up comedy
02:32:43 I never fucking do it and I hate myself
02:32:45 every minute that I'm not fucking doing it
02:32:47 yeah I have some uh
02:32:49 I don't know if I'm as
02:32:51 afraid as you are because for me it was
02:32:53 kind of a relief that
02:32:55 like I feel like I'm a lot better at
02:32:57 YouTube than all the other things I wanted to do
02:32:59 so like sometimes I think
02:33:01 hey I still want to be a novelist I still
02:33:03 have all these great ideas for novels and
02:33:05 like I'm never gonna write them because it's so much
02:33:07 easier and more fun and fulfilling
02:33:09 to just make YouTube videos and not try to
02:33:11 write this shitty book I watch I'll watch
02:33:13 like a Bo Burnham special like his new
02:33:15 special just came out and I watch like
02:33:17 the stuff that he does on stage and it's
02:33:19 like very subversive and he does all this
02:33:21 like bombast and pomp and circumstance
02:33:23 he's always got like recordings going off
02:33:25 and lights and like flashing steam and shit
02:33:27 and it's just like
02:33:29 I like that's the kind of stuff that
02:33:31 I watch and I feel like I'm I have
02:33:33 to be wasting my potential on YouTube
02:33:35 I should be on a
02:33:37 grander stage I don't fucking know
02:33:39 yeah I
02:33:41 I get you and especially with music
02:33:43 because I obviously
02:33:45 me and you collab on music
02:33:47 yeah and I definitely
02:33:49 think I mean I've been saying all this time
02:33:51 that I think I'm the biggest fan of your videos
02:33:53 but I know I'm the
02:33:55 biggest fan of your music because I don't think anybody
02:33:57 else cares about it but me
02:33:59 but like legitimately
02:34:01 I uh I have often
02:34:03 I have often said this of myself
02:34:05 and I don't
02:34:07 say it necessarily on line
02:34:09 as much because
02:34:11 I feel like I haven't
02:34:13 posted enough to prove this to people
02:34:15 so I feel uncomfortable saying it
02:34:17 but in real life I sell the time
02:34:19 I'm the greatest fucking lyricist who ever lived
02:34:21 in the face of the earth
02:34:23 and I'll fucking plant my flag in it
02:34:25 I'll fucking draw the line it's my hill to die on
02:34:27 I'll say it until I'm dead
02:34:29 but I just I
02:34:31 I never say that on line because I feel like I haven't proved it enough
02:34:33 I legit from what I know
02:34:35 of your lyrics I can't
02:34:37 immediately disagree with that
02:34:39 like I can't name a lyricist off the top of my head
02:34:41 who I think like blows you out of the water
02:34:43 and like it's such
02:34:45 like an ever present like feeling in my head
02:34:47 that like uh
02:34:49 maybe like old Eminem
02:34:51 yeah Eminem I definitely put up there
02:34:53 Eminem has
02:34:55 made some incredible wordplay
02:34:57 in his time
02:34:59 but then he did fucking
02:35:01 rap god fucking garbage
02:35:03 but um
02:35:05 yeah it's like it's to where like
02:35:07 you've
02:35:09 you've seen the you've seen this phenomenon
02:35:11 play out with me in the past
02:35:13 I cannot stand
02:35:15 to see other rappers complimented
02:35:17 it burns me up inside
02:35:19 on like a primal level
02:35:21 even like like
02:35:23 that video that we're going on like
02:35:25 look at how these rappers are such
02:35:27 great lyricists and look at how
02:35:29 you know people say things like oh man
02:35:31 Kendrick Lamar he's bringing lyrical rap back
02:35:33 or and I just
02:35:35 fucking even if it's like an
02:35:37 innocuous compliment of some rapper
02:35:39 who I agree is good I still like if I
02:35:41 hear someone praising
02:35:43 the other rapper I just fucking sit there
02:35:45 and I stew you sons of bitches
02:35:47 don't even fucking know I hate all of you
02:35:49 you're all worms are beneath me
02:35:51 it's well it's
02:35:53 upsetting right because I mean music
02:35:55 is incredibly hard to promote
02:35:57 it's upsetting to me that I haven't
02:35:59 um had
02:36:01 put in the time to prove that to people
02:36:03 because it's something that I feel
02:36:05 is true of myself but I've
02:36:07 I'm always focused on YouTube well it's that like
02:36:09 you've got you've got great stuff but it's
02:36:11 all hidden behind like
02:36:13 like the fact that the
02:36:15 productions never that good you know because
02:36:17 up until recently you didn't have a great
02:36:19 microphone and
02:36:21 you know you don't really know
02:36:23 audio mixing and most of the beats like
02:36:25 you said are just ripped from YouTube
02:36:27 so it's harder to have like
02:36:29 something that you can put
02:36:31 out there and be like hey guys listen to this
02:36:33 rap it's on iTunes and they'll be like oh
02:36:35 shit I'm paying for that it's
02:36:37 it always feels like kind
02:36:39 of internet but if you actually
02:36:41 pay attention to it
02:36:43 the songs are great like
02:36:45 legitimately one of my favorite songs
02:36:47 ever is the coolest guy
02:36:49 rap where it's just this
02:36:51 really hype beat that you
02:36:53 took from YouTube
02:36:55 and you just wrap this completely
02:36:57 nonsensical insane
02:36:59 verse over it it's like one verse it's like
02:37:01 four minutes long and it's
02:37:03 fucking great it's legitimately
02:37:05 like that I walk around
02:37:07 my house rapping it to myself
02:37:09 because I've spent years learning it
02:37:11 that's one that if I
02:37:13 ever get around to actually making the album
02:37:15 that I have in my head that would be
02:37:17 on it I would probably re-record it
02:37:19 and tighten up the lyrics
02:37:21 in some spots but that song would definitely
02:37:23 make the cut for an album
02:37:25 but like I could easily see
02:37:27 hearing that song and being like
02:37:29 whatever it's just some
02:37:31 YouTube guy rapping about dumb stuff
02:37:33 but then like when you
02:37:35 really pay attention to it like
02:37:37 the lyrics fit the beat really well
02:37:39 um you know it's not gonna
02:37:41 knock your trunk or anything
02:37:43 but like it's kind of funny how
02:37:45 like a lot of people will listen to something like
02:37:47 uh folk music or
02:37:49 drone or something that's like recorded
02:37:51 or black metal like shitty recordings
02:37:53 uh like that sound like they're coming out
02:37:55 of a fucking cell phone
02:37:57 but it fits the music and
02:37:59 that can be great and I think that when it comes
02:38:01 to rap so many people have the expectation
02:38:03 that rap is supposed to be this heavy bass
02:38:05 trunk knocking, fun time
02:38:07 listening stuff
02:38:09 and I don't think it has to be
02:38:11 and the coolest guy is a song
02:38:13 that I think works in spite
02:38:15 of the production
02:38:17 not being all there because
02:38:19 it's still a fun hype beat
02:38:21 and it's still fun hype lyrics that have all these
02:38:23 character and you use all these voices
02:38:25 and the part where you know
02:38:27 you just get into this deep rasp and you're like
02:38:29 sitting on the beach and it looks like hell
02:38:31 the water's blood red because it's L-C-L
02:38:33 look at Ray's head
02:38:35 and you can tell everyone's
02:38:37 dead so what's that smell
02:38:39 it's my asshole you know it's like
02:38:41 like in the middle of this otherwise
02:38:43 fairly technical and like
02:38:45 clever wordplay rap
02:38:47 and then it's just this weird
02:38:49 demonic end of Ava
02:38:51 if you listen
02:38:53 to enough of my raps if you listen to
02:38:55 enough freestyles for me
02:38:57 you will very quickly see that the two things
02:38:59 I always fall back on are
02:39:01 what's that smell
02:39:03 and suck my dick
02:39:05 those two lines will make an
02:39:07 appearance in everything I do
02:39:09 there's no suck my dick in the coolest guy
02:39:11 but there is what's that smell
02:39:13 but yeah I've heard them
02:39:15 come up a few times
02:39:17 but yeah I really enjoy the rap
02:39:19 something about what's that smell is inherently
02:39:21 the funniest thing in the world to me
02:39:23 and I can't explain why
02:39:25 and some of the like
02:39:27 again to me knowing a lot more about you
02:39:29 the song Alright
02:39:31 which is
02:39:33 this like very
02:39:35 open-hearted lyrical song
02:39:37 and
02:39:39 like it just sounds like
02:39:41 if it was any other artist
02:39:43 it sounds like just a list
02:39:45 song kind of thing like you know
02:39:47 you say my friends think this about me
02:39:49 and they're right they're alright
02:39:51 but fuck them I'm alright you know it goes through
02:39:53 this like chain of each different type
02:39:55 of person and what they say about you
02:39:57 but because I know you personally I know those are all
02:39:59 exactly what those people think
02:40:01 like you present
02:40:03 like there's even a difference
02:40:05 between a verse where you're talking about your offline
02:40:07 friends and your online friends and I can tell
02:40:09 which ones which because
02:40:11 you know the
02:40:13 offline friends think of you as like this volatile
02:40:15 like this very honest
02:40:17 and caring guy who's also very
02:40:19 volatile and has no chill
02:40:21 and then your online friends think of you as this
02:40:23 visionary genius but also just this fat
02:40:25 weirdo you know and like
02:40:27 you go through each
02:40:29 person in your life and like
02:40:31 describe how they feel about your girlfriends
02:40:33 who all think you rock in bed of course
02:40:35 you know and
02:40:37 and then the ending like you know
02:40:39 of your friends you'll say and they're right they're alright
02:40:41 but so what
02:40:43 I'm alright but then when it's your fans
02:40:45 then you're like but fuck you
02:40:47 I'm alright you know it's like
02:40:49 the different levels of regret there's a lot to
02:40:51 get into it and like I
02:40:53 get it all because I know
02:40:55 that it's all real it's a complete
02:40:57 psychological picture
02:40:59 yeah it's fucking great
02:41:01 and I've listened to that song you know a lot
02:41:03 of times and then
02:41:05 like just
02:41:07 like with rotten
02:41:09 like I'll break this down because I guess
02:41:11 we did this in the chat so I'm gonna break it down
02:41:13 for the audience the like analysis
02:41:15 I did of rotten
02:41:17 of your verse
02:41:19 this was a song that shade was making
02:41:21 he's just making a beat
02:41:23 in a FL studio
02:41:25 and it sounded kind of like a Tyler the
02:41:27 creator beat so I decided
02:41:29 I was gonna write like a dark grimy like
02:41:31 Earl sweatshirt Tyler the creator type
02:41:33 rhyme over it and I
02:41:35 end up writing this verse about like
02:41:37 just being in my room drinking and trying to
02:41:39 get over my problems right
02:41:41 you know it's got a little bit of fun
02:41:43 in it but I'm not very good at like word play
02:41:45 or like really
02:41:47 complex stuff like my rhymes are usually
02:41:49 very direct it's usually like exactly
02:41:51 what I say is what it means
02:41:53 I record these two verses
02:41:55 I send them off to you
02:41:57 and within hours
02:41:59 you've completed like you didn't even
02:42:01 you've never heard this song before you didn't know
02:42:03 the concept you didn't know what it was gonna
02:42:05 be and I sent it to you and
02:42:07 you perfectly captured
02:42:09 all of the emotions
02:42:11 that were in my part
02:42:13 in your own you even worked in stuff that I hadn't
02:42:15 like the very last line of my song
02:42:17 of my verse is I'm grown
02:42:19 I'm grown I'm grown I'm grown I'm grown
02:42:21 which I hadn't planned to be in there
02:42:23 it was just like at the very end
02:42:25 I thought what if I do in this suggestion
02:42:27 that like
02:42:29 you know that I shouldn't be this way
02:42:31 because I'm grown up and then you throw in a line
02:42:33 that's like I used to dream of how I'd
02:42:35 be when I was grown picture me with a six pack
02:42:37 not not the kind that foams which
02:42:39 is a fucking phenomenal
02:42:41 line great word play great imagery
02:42:43 but also
02:42:45 totally is in there just because of my line
02:42:47 I'm grown I'm grown I'm grown like you expanded
02:42:49 on the concept of the song
02:42:51 in a way that it wouldn't have been like that would have felt
02:42:53 out of nowhere at the end if not for the fact
02:42:55 that you put that line in your verse
02:42:57 so it made my verses
02:42:59 better and then the word play
02:43:01 in there is like
02:43:03 I gotta get those like three
02:43:05 like triple syllable rhymes
02:43:07 in a row in it because it's like
02:43:09 come to on the floor in a pile
02:43:11 of trash and piss shit stained drawers I'm
02:43:13 a hot mess hoarder the lord of disorder
02:43:15 calorie absorber performer
02:43:17 a camcorder and on board
02:43:19 that's in insanity
02:43:21 that's four
02:43:23 three syllable words that all rhyme
02:43:25 and then it goes
02:43:27 like stick more horrors with my thick
02:43:29 pork sword it's crazy
02:43:31 and you didn't even try to make it technical
02:43:33 that was just what came into your head
02:43:35 that's
02:43:37 next level that's what the best
02:43:39 rappers do that's all
02:43:41 the techniques that they were talking about in that
02:43:43 rap analysis video all the things that all
02:43:45 the greats do what they're all known
02:43:47 for you did all that
02:43:49 in an hour
02:43:51 yeah so yeah that was about
02:43:53 three percent of my lyrical
02:43:55 power I'd say
02:43:57 and yeah so
02:43:59 for me it almost like
02:44:01 hurts to know that
02:44:03 other people like when I played
02:44:05 butt sugar for my friends and they all were just
02:44:07 like this is one of my friends kept saying
02:44:09 this is just Tom Green
02:44:11 this is just my bum is on your lips
02:44:13 I'm like no it's not it's Tom Green
02:44:15 song is fucking stupid butt chugger
02:44:17 has a whole narrative arc
02:44:19 a whole emotional arc about this character
02:44:21 when will people appreciate the technical
02:44:23 mastery of butt chugger
02:44:25 well like
02:44:27 cause that's the thing when you listen to butt chugger it seems
02:44:29 like it's just gonna be a dumb song about
02:44:31 butt chugging but then it has this whole narrative
02:44:33 about this this kid who like
02:44:35 you know
02:44:37 butt chugging is basically a metaphor for
02:44:39 art or for getting into
02:44:41 something that like passion you know
02:44:43 like he discovers a passion but then
02:44:45 society hammers him back down
02:44:47 and forces him to become like a normal
02:44:49 stiff and then he
02:44:51 realizes that the butt chugging was
02:44:53 in him all along and he just has to be
02:44:55 himself it's like a whole fucking
02:44:57 film you know not to
02:44:59 not to take anything away from
02:45:01 Tom Green's legendary masterpiece
02:45:03 lonely Swedish to bum bum song
02:45:05 which is one of the greatest songs
02:45:07 ever written I just want to clarify that for everyone
02:45:09 that fucking that part
02:45:11 in that song where like he breaks it down
02:45:13 it gets to like the bridge and it gets quiet and he's
02:45:15 like my bum is on the phone
02:45:17 my bum is all alone
02:45:19 and then it like stops and then it goes into like
02:45:21 my bum is all alone
02:45:23 my bum is all alone
02:45:25 my bum is all alone
02:45:27 get the poo off my bum
02:45:29 get the poo off I need the poo
02:45:31 off the bum I gotta get the poo off my bum
02:45:33 that fucking song is
02:45:35 a masterpiece I legitimately love that song
02:45:37 I'm realizing I've never
02:45:39 actually heard the full song
02:45:41 oh god it's great
02:45:43 I mostly know it from fucking M&M's
02:45:45 and then the video ends
02:45:47 and he's like he's on the beach and he's in like
02:45:49 like waist deep water and the video
02:45:51 just ends with him like picking up this duck
02:45:53 prop and there's like a string on it and he's just like
02:45:55 none of this is real
02:45:57 none of this is real
02:45:59 the video ends
02:46:01 Tom Green was a visionary
02:46:03 alright more credit to
02:46:05 Tom Green's bum song
02:46:07 but yeah but sugar's great
02:46:09 um
02:46:11 obviously the t-bap
02:46:13 really saw something in it because they became
02:46:15 fans on the basis of that song
02:46:17 which is fucking fantastic
02:46:19 but yeah
02:46:21 it hurts me to know that you
02:46:23 that you have never achieved in any
02:46:25 avenue the success
02:46:27 that I think you deserve
02:46:29 um and it's just like
02:46:31 a matter of the audience
02:46:33 I feel like there must be people out there
02:46:35 who would get it you know
02:46:37 I feel like your work is
02:46:39 just oddly more
02:46:41 highbrow than
02:46:43 people appreciate
02:46:45 and I was so glad because
02:46:47 I made that video of the top 10
02:46:49 analysis videos of 2015
02:46:51 and I had both what you're
02:46:53 gonna do and the horseshoe finale in there
02:46:55 and you know my old
02:46:57 mentor ghost lightning
02:46:59 you know he's more my friend but I always call
02:47:01 my mentor so people get like a mental
02:47:03 picture of you know the fact that he
02:47:05 that I based a lot of my
02:47:07 writing style on him but he's like
02:47:09 you know like an old
02:47:11 like lit major guy he's a dude
02:47:13 who's like big into like high
02:47:15 concept novels and shit and
02:47:17 he watched what you're gonna do
02:47:19 twice after seeing it
02:47:21 in my analysis
02:47:23 video stick it absolutely loved it and I was
02:47:25 like that that to
02:47:27 me was the moment I was like yeah this is the
02:47:29 people who should be watching Jesse's content
02:47:31 like people who appreciate
02:47:33 the like the high-minded
02:47:35 meta nature of it and
02:47:37 that ending fucking
02:47:39 bit that's just perfect
02:47:41 you can't that song will never
02:47:43 be better than it was in that video
02:47:45 that Kanye West song like it's
02:47:47 the most appropriate context that it could
02:47:49 ever be given that's right you're
02:47:51 fucking welcome Kanye
02:47:53 you fucking hack you're welcome
02:47:55 for me making your song worthwhile
02:47:57 for making it art
02:47:59 I mean it was a great song
02:48:01 that's uh that's one of my
02:48:03 that's one of my favorite shots that I've done
02:48:05 as a director
02:48:07 of me sitting in that corner with all those
02:48:09 wrestling posters and the hot red
02:48:11 shirt and um
02:48:13 I think one of my favorite things
02:48:15 because I think like
02:48:17 a lot of the thing the part that
02:48:19 doesn't get talked about
02:48:21 with YouTubers especially
02:48:23 a YouTuber like how I do things
02:48:25 and not even I really talk about this much is that
02:48:27 like the directorial aspect
02:48:29 of it of like
02:48:31 because um I'm really
02:48:33 into
02:48:35 iconic shots
02:48:37 shots that are um
02:48:39 instantly
02:48:41 descriptive of the video itself
02:48:43 or that and that are
02:48:45 completely unique to me like
02:48:48 I've only done two shots like this
02:48:50 I think that really work on that level
02:48:52 because so much of my writing
02:48:54 is referential
02:48:56 and you know has bits and like
02:48:58 you know like catchphrases that I've stolen
02:49:00 from wrestlers and little references to things
02:49:02 and in-jokes and stuff um
02:49:04 but
02:49:05 some of the things that I'm really proud of are these
02:49:07 shots that just completely stand on their own
02:49:09 and encapsulate the video one of them is
02:49:11 at the end of what you're gonna do when that
02:49:13 fucking thing in the corner and the other
02:49:15 one is the shot of me
02:49:17 right at the end of horseshoe finale where I'm sort of
02:49:19 curled up in the fetal position
02:49:21 and the
02:49:23 and the fucking dog that fucking
02:49:25 dog
02:49:27 Jesus Christ one of the greatest miracles
02:49:29 that ever happened in the history of art
02:49:31 that the day that I was
02:49:33 filming that my sister
02:49:35 happened to randomly bring her dog home
02:49:37 and I fucking
02:49:39 I brought the dog
02:49:41 downstairs and I'm like
02:49:43 this might not work but if it works
02:49:45 it'll be the best thing I've ever filmed in my life
02:49:47 and I fucking laid there
02:49:49 and I had the dog just off camera
02:49:51 and I was just hoping that it didn't come too soon
02:49:53 and then when I got to the
02:49:55 when I felt like I had laid there long enough
02:49:57 I just fucking just a little bit
02:50:01 on the floor so the dog
02:50:03 would hear and come over and she fucking came over
02:50:05 and it was
02:50:07 it's the best thing I've ever filmed in my life I'm so
02:50:09 proud of it I look at it all the time and I just
02:50:11 come I come bullets
02:50:13 it's great
02:50:15 yeah I mean we covered a lot of that
02:50:17 in the authorial intent video which again
02:50:19 I know you weren't there for but like we talked a lot
02:50:21 about how nobody
02:50:23 appreciates that every shot has to be
02:50:25 set up it's never like
02:50:27 I mean a lot of the time when we're vlogging it is
02:50:29 just like point a camera at myself
02:50:31 and film but like we choose
02:50:33 what angle to film from and
02:50:35 what like what's going to be in the
02:50:37 background and you know
02:50:39 one of the most complicated ones
02:50:41 that to this day nobody appreciates
02:50:43 because I don't think anyone noticed it
02:50:45 is um
02:50:47 at a certain part of
02:50:49 Horseshoe finale how like
02:50:51 the video is sort of segmented into like different
02:50:53 me's in different parts of the room
02:50:55 that sort of represent like different aspects of my
02:50:57 personality
02:50:59 and the one where I'm in the
02:51:01 the bookshelf room and how
02:51:03 there's that corner and it's directly across
02:51:05 from the bookshelf
02:51:07 I put a fucking video camera
02:51:09 in the background
02:51:11 playing video of myself recording on the
02:51:13 other side of the room as though
02:51:15 I was delivering these monologues
02:51:17 at the same fucking time actually
02:51:19 teleporting across the room and if you look
02:51:21 at that fucking shot you can see me
02:51:23 in the video camera fucking ranting
02:51:25 while I'm ranting and that was so
02:51:27 retardedly
02:51:29 complex to set up
02:51:31 and no one notices it until now and
02:51:33 now everyone will notice it and I'll tell me I'm a
02:51:35 mess all over again
02:51:37 I believe I do remember that I need to
02:51:39 rewatch I have I've never
02:51:41 rewatched all of Horseshoe finale like
02:51:43 it was just a one time
02:51:45 sat down and watched the whole thing
02:51:47 and at the time
02:51:49 it felt so fucking massive
02:51:51 because like
02:51:53 I would say that that video is probably what broke me
02:51:55 to long videos because now I watch them all the time
02:51:57 like I will watch a video that's an hour
02:51:59 and a half long just because I'm sitting
02:52:01 at the computer and it came out
02:52:03 like there's no hesitation there's no
02:52:05 like waiting around for a time
02:52:07 when I have time it's just like nah it's
02:52:09 put it on so
02:52:11 like at the time Horseshoe finale came out
02:52:13 it was like an ordeal to watch this whole
02:52:15 thing especially because so much
02:52:17 of it is just ranting and like
02:52:19 you know like
02:52:21 holding in all this information as it goes
02:52:23 but uh I think
02:52:25 nowadays it would be much easier to just like
02:52:27 consume all at once
02:52:29 I am overdue for a rewatch
02:52:31 of it and uh you know
02:52:33 it's funny because I keep thinking
02:52:35 I kept thinking well I really have to rewatch
02:52:37 the whole Horseshoe saga but now
02:52:39 that I think about it I've seen End of Ava
02:52:41 and Gileon way more times than I've seen
02:52:43 Ava so
02:52:45 so maybe it'd be justified
02:52:47 you know there are a lot of people who've
02:52:49 told me over the years that they've only seen
02:52:51 End of Ava or that they saw it first so
02:52:53 maybe people should go watch the Horseshoe finale
02:52:55 uh because it does kind
02:52:57 of stand on its own I did get one comment
02:52:59 once of a guy who watched that
02:53:01 first and then worked his way backwards
02:53:03 and he seemed to
02:53:05 enjoy the experience so maybe that works too
02:53:07 I don't fucking know
02:53:09 yeah I'd say it's where I mean it does start off with
02:53:11 like a summary of all the other videos in a way
02:53:13 so maybe it's easier
02:53:15 that way I don't know
02:53:17 I'm overdue for it
02:53:19 alright well
02:53:21 we're getting close to three hours on this which I
02:53:23 guess is gonna be my time limit
02:53:25 for these things because it seems reasonable
02:53:27 and it's about how long it takes for my eyes
02:53:29 to start bleeding out of my fucking skull
02:53:31 so uh do you have
02:53:33 anything else you wanted to talk about to share
02:53:35 with our fans about yourself
02:53:37 just stuff that
02:53:39 I hope to be able to do in the future
02:53:41 and stuff that I plan to do
02:53:43 um like
02:53:45 stuff beyond YouTube
02:53:47 like I talked about the album and I talked about wanting
02:53:49 to do more stand up
02:53:51 um I also
02:53:53 want to make more videos about comics because
02:53:55 that's like a medium that's important
02:53:57 to me that has been like
02:53:59 woefully underrepresented throughout my YouTube
02:54:01 career like I've never made videos about comics
02:54:03 before and I want to and I should
02:54:05 because there are no good comic book
02:54:07 YouTube people right at all
02:54:09 well now we've got Captain
02:54:11 Christian but his stuff is very general and
02:54:13 broad
02:54:15 yeah and not just videos
02:54:17 about comics but even like outside of YouTube like
02:54:19 I think all the time about
02:54:21 writing comics
02:54:23 or fucking specifically like Marvel
02:54:25 and DC because I'm so in love with all the characters
02:54:27 and
02:54:29 you know I'm not a fucking comic book person
02:54:31 so it would be impossible
02:54:33 so I always
02:54:35 because like I think about superheroes all the time
02:54:37 like I not even like as
02:54:39 like a YouTube analyst guy I just
02:54:41 lay in my bed every night and I just like reflect
02:54:43 on like what makes
02:54:45 Spider-Man a great character as opposed to
02:54:47 what makes Wolverine a great character
02:54:49 and Superman is totally different in his own
02:54:51 way and the Punisher is great in his way
02:54:53 and I like I feel like nobody gets these
02:54:55 characters but me and it's like this constant
02:54:57 nagging feeling in my head like nobody
02:54:59 I should be writing all
02:55:01 the comics in the world on the own I have all
02:55:03 the best ideas but like
02:55:05 I don't know like I talked I think
02:55:07 all the time about
02:55:09 collabing with Ben and me like
02:55:11 writing out some dumb fan fiction
02:55:13 idea and having him draw it
02:55:15 I've never approached him about it because he's always
02:55:17 busy writing his own comics and I don't want to fucking
02:55:19 bother him with my stupid shit if you have money
02:55:21 then he will
02:55:23 be on board
02:55:25 that's why I'm like I'm such a huge
02:55:27 fan of Ben just because
02:55:29 he's really good at
02:55:31 something that I haven't done yet
02:55:33 yeah that's I think that's exactly
02:55:35 why I'm a huge fan of Ben because
02:55:37 like I just want his I want
02:55:39 to eat him and steal exactly
02:55:41 I want to be
02:55:43 with him
02:55:45 and he's like
02:55:47 it's just that Ben's good at drawing
02:55:49 and exactly how I want to be good at drawing
02:55:51 like I don't want to be able to draw
02:55:53 like hyper detailed stuff I just want to be
02:55:55 able to draw dynamic poses and like convey
02:55:57 the idea of what I want
02:55:59 you know and like
02:56:01 since becoming friends with Ben I've gotten like way more into
02:56:03 like
02:56:05 buying like independent comics
02:56:07 that like aren't Marvel or DC shit
02:56:09 like these stories that people come up with
02:56:11 because like I guess it never clicked
02:56:13 before I never realized in my head oh
02:56:15 that's where these come from
02:56:17 they come from guys like Ben who just
02:56:19 fucking write them and then they become comics
02:56:21 whoa
02:56:23 like I never put two and two together before
02:56:25 yeah you're used to them coming from like
02:56:27 a look at industry
02:56:29 yeah
02:56:31 yeah I'm excited for that because I specifically
02:56:33 requested it I think a month
02:56:35 ago I was like hey Jesse
02:56:37 you've got all those comics in the background
02:56:39 I want to hear about all of them because
02:56:41 I don't know anything about comics
02:56:43 and what I really want to do I had this
02:56:45 idea the other day is um
02:56:47 because I've talked before in videos about
02:56:49 uh whatever happened to the Caped Crusader
02:56:51 which is like my favorite Batman story
02:56:53 right and um
02:56:55 I got the idea of like
02:56:57 doing like a Matthew Matosis style
02:56:59 read through of the whole comic
02:57:01 on a video and like stopping and
02:57:03 analyzing like every panel I want to do it so bad
02:57:05 but it's impossible to do anything it's too much
02:57:07 shit to do as a friend since that never happened
02:57:09 I would love to see that man I mean
02:57:11 I'm I like whenever
02:57:13 there's a medium I don't know much about
02:57:15 like every video that
02:57:17 explains it to me is like
02:57:19 deeply fascinating like that
02:57:21 time you linked me like Razor Fist
02:57:23 Top 10 Daredevil
02:57:25 comics and I was like I don't know
02:57:27 anything about Daredevil and I can't stand
02:57:29 Razor Fist but I watched the whole
02:57:31 thing just because I was like
02:57:33 man I'd really love to know what
02:57:35 makes Daredevil cool like here's a character
02:57:37 that everyone else knows about but me
02:57:39 it seems like and I don't give a single
02:57:41 fuck about him so please
02:57:43 tell me why he's so cool you know
02:57:45 yeah um and
02:57:47 and and and that it that it so
02:57:49 clearly was like here's
02:57:51 10 read these you know like
02:57:53 I wish he had put them in order
02:57:55 of like which ones you
02:57:57 should read first as like a new
02:57:59 reader that would have been helpful too
02:58:01 because for me comics are just overwhelming
02:58:03 there's just too fucking much you know
02:58:05 um
02:58:07 which is why I was kind of excited over
02:58:09 new 52 I know you're not a huge fan of it
02:58:11 but like it was a great way to be like hey
02:58:13 I can pick up any of them now and it
02:58:15 doesn't matter man you mentioned new 52
02:58:17 this is a totally off topic
02:58:19 I mean then again what is off topic this is
02:58:21 a fucking podcast about me
02:58:23 man that fucking
02:58:25 DC rebirth comic that just came out
02:58:27 was the best fucking thing I've ever
02:58:29 seen I fucking I like I got the
02:58:31 feeling that comics were saved
02:58:33 like maybe I got too excited
02:58:35 but it was so cool because like I've
02:58:37 been complaining about the new 52
02:58:39 since the new 52 was a thing
02:58:41 because it's this like it was
02:58:43 this like marketing ploy of like resetting
02:58:45 continuity but they reset continuity
02:58:47 in such a weird way that it like messed
02:58:49 up everything and like holds
02:58:51 chunks were like gone and you couldn't
02:58:53 fucking figure it out
02:58:55 and so DC
02:58:57 they printed just two weeks ago
02:58:59 this fucking 80 page comic
02:59:01 that was essentially we're sorry
02:59:03 in comic book form
02:59:05 and the whole fucking comic was like the flash
02:59:07 has like been phased out of
02:59:09 existence because of flashpoint which started
02:59:11 the new 52 and he's trying to get back he's like
02:59:13 everybody's forgotten we've had 10 years
02:59:15 of fucking of continuity
02:59:17 stolen from us 10 years of love stolen from
02:59:19 us and he comes back at the end and they get
02:59:21 all their fucking memories back or whatever
02:59:23 and it resets the thing and I'm like I'm gonna
02:59:25 jack off I'm gonna jack off and I'm gonna
02:59:27 come right in this fucking comic pages are gonna stick together
02:59:29 I have to buy a new one I don't care jacking off right on
02:59:31 it oh yeah DC you did it
02:59:33 it was cool comics are great I love comics
02:59:35 when comics comics are like wrestling
02:59:37 for me in that they're often terrible
02:59:39 but when they're great they're my favorite thing in the world
02:59:41 right that's the impression I
02:59:43 that's why for both of those
02:59:45 I can't like I'd rather
02:59:47 experience them through you
02:59:49 because experiencing them myself
02:59:51 is like it's so hard to find
02:59:53 the gold nuggets and
02:59:55 for someone who's an outsider to it it's like
02:59:57 you know it's too much
02:59:59 like with wrestling I know what's good
03:00:01 about wrestling now that I've had you
03:00:03 tell me so much and I've read some good articles
03:00:05 on it but like I would have to watch
03:00:07 all of wrestling history to find
03:00:09 the good shit you know
03:00:11 I'd rather just have people
03:00:13 pick it out and re-explain
03:00:15 it to me and yeah
03:00:17 like is there any other mediums
03:00:19 like for me I know
03:00:21 there's no other
03:00:23 only the epic lore
03:00:25 of the insane clown posse
03:00:27 that's the one avenue
03:00:29 of my fandom that nobody
03:00:31 knows about yet
03:00:33 that I have yet to analyze for the world
03:00:35 yeah I know you're
03:00:37 big into the ICP
03:00:39 and nobody will probably understand
03:00:41 that unless you
03:00:43 get into it in a deep way
03:00:45 um
03:00:47 yeah I wish
03:00:49 I could get it like
03:00:51 I kind of wish I could talk about music
03:00:53 because music's a big part of my life
03:00:55 uh I
03:00:57 it's so hard to
03:00:59 discuss
03:01:01 I have a whole series that I've wanted to do for a while
03:01:03 called awesome albums
03:01:05 where I just talk about the albums that I like
03:01:07 and like the thing was that
03:01:09 I would rate them on a scale of
03:01:11 1 to 10 but regardless of what
03:01:13 score I gave them they would all be certified
03:01:15 awesome albums even if it was like a 1 or a 2
03:01:19 like Saint Anger by Metallica gets
03:01:21 a 2 out of 10 and it's an awesome album
03:01:25 yeah I mean I finally did
03:01:27 something like
03:01:29 again this whole vlogging thing
03:01:31 I mean you already vlog
03:01:33 but I do recommend it as a way to
03:01:35 like for some of this shit
03:01:37 where I was never going to write a video
03:01:39 about my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
03:01:41 but like I just sat down and talked about it for
03:01:43 45 minutes and it was pretty fucking gratifying
03:01:45 to just like have all the
03:01:47 thoughts about that album out there
03:01:49 and now I never have to explain it again
03:01:51 you know like I don't have it eating away
03:01:53 at my consciousness that nobody understands
03:01:55 why I like this album so much
03:01:59 I think there's something very liberating about
03:02:01 random vlogs
03:02:03 and people seem to eat the shit up is what I don't
03:02:05 get like I'm amazed at how much people
03:02:07 like don't hate them because I definitely
03:02:09 hate my own vlogs but the
03:02:11 fucking the people it's what the people crave
03:02:13 apparently
03:02:15 yeah it's it's people just want more
03:02:17 they just want more of everything like
03:02:19 I started I did this video
03:02:21 of me laying on the couch
03:02:23 watching an anime and just turning
03:02:25 the camera on I don't know if you have you seen
03:02:27 either of my two latest vlogs I haven't watched
03:02:29 them yet I've seen them on my sub feed
03:02:31 you should definitely watch the newer one
03:02:33 it's like an hour long
03:02:35 you could probably skip the first 30 minutes
03:02:37 but the second half of it is fucking hilarious
03:02:39 and it's so Jesse like
03:02:41 it's amazing because
03:02:43 I got really drunk and just started
03:02:45 like screaming about everything
03:02:47 and like getting really emotional and like
03:02:49 going into different locations and like
03:02:51 taking a breather and stuff like that
03:02:53 and trying to kill myself
03:02:55 it's great
03:02:57 but like the first one
03:02:59 is just literally 45
03:03:01 minutes of me turning on a camera
03:03:03 after each episode of the show and going like
03:03:05 well that episode was kind of stupid
03:03:07 you know and then like people
03:03:09 like loved it
03:03:11 and I didn't I thought nobody was
03:03:13 gonna like it and it got like 7000
03:03:15 views and I was like what the fuck
03:03:17 this is nonsense and everyone's like
03:03:19 make more make more and I was like
03:03:21 okay I guess so I made the next one
03:03:23 an hour long and I was like no one's
03:03:25 gonna watch that and then
03:03:27 cause first they want a second one
03:03:29 and then it becomes a series
03:03:31 and then it becomes something you're tied to forever
03:03:33 and they all want it
03:03:35 and like I recorded a third one
03:03:37 today and like after I was done with it
03:03:39 I was like I legitimately don't care
03:03:41 about this like I will release this
03:03:43 and people will like this but this video
03:03:45 I legitimately could throw away
03:03:47 right now and it will make
03:03:49 no difference to me I don't care
03:03:51 you know the only
03:03:53 incentive to release it is knowing that it
03:03:55 will get views anyways and there's
03:03:57 like how hard is it to throw the
03:03:59 clips into a thing and render them for an hour
03:04:01 you know that's a nightmare
03:04:03 yeah
03:04:05 anything else you wanted to
03:04:07 talk about that you're
03:04:09 I'm the best guy
03:04:11 with the biggest dick and I have the most
03:04:13 women's and I'm the best
03:04:15 at art
03:04:17 alright
03:04:19 I guess we covered everything
03:04:21 thanks for listening guys
03:04:23 yeah
